
okay okay i can see him
that it here he comes
careful
all right i got him i got him
sensors
ahem
vitals
stable
clamp
scissors
scissors
severing umbilical
umbilical cut okay clear
wait dropping fast bp dropping fast
respirations are slow
shallow and irregular
o2 sat down 82 percent
bp 80 over 30 he in v-tach
get the paddles
may i have some dopamine
dopamine
ive got the paddles
okay everybody clear
all clear
clear
heart rate stable
easy easy
okay were good
no physical discrepancies
he perfect
he just perfect
i like melvin
he much more of a melvin
somehow ginger and melvin
doesnt have quite the same ring to it
okay then fred it is
all right
come on little fella ahem
look at that
he so cute
all set
let do it
all right
okay
were good
nice
ginger meet fred fred meet ginger
what are they doing
imprinting
see
love at first sight
i wish you would fill me in
i like to think were a team
i like to think im a sounding board
youre much more than that barlow
it just another dog-and-pony show
we could splice a dog and pony
they can take the meeting for us
maybe i can help you with your publicity
if god didnt want us to explore
his domain whyd he give us the map
bumper-sticker wisdom
i get it and i am totally with you guys
on every level
but joan charot can make or break
our project without even blinking
we should all be nervous
as in survival-instinct nervous so come on
who heads up
i dont want to spoil the surprise
come on
you love surprises
no surprises make me nauseous
over the course of the last
three years our lab has combined
the dna from a variety of species
to create a completely new life form
and as you know
ginger has exceeded all expectations
in her ability to produce
medicinal proteins for livestock
what you dont know is that
since the birth of fred
we have an upgraded
splicing technique
which can be applied to the most
sophisticated of organisms namely
human beings
whoa whoa whoa
hold on let not get
too far ahead of ourselves
by incorporating human dna
into the hybrid template
we can begin to address any number
of genetically-influenced diseases
parkinson alzheimer diabetes
even some forms of cancer
well
i cant tell you how um excited we are
the entire board is thrilled
with the progress youve made
which is why we are so anxious
to move on to phase two
phase two
the product stage
we need to isolate the gene in ginger
and fred that produces your magic protein
we are shutting down
the splicing facilities
retooling your labs
for intensive chemical analysis
shutting down
i dont understand
uh were handing you
the medical breakthrough of the century
we could begin
elsa we all know that cant happen
right now
the moral outrage would be
completely out of control
i mean regulators and politicians
theyd tear us to pieces
please
if we dont use human dna now
someone else will
look wed love to go there
shoot for incredible medical breakthroughs
of course we would
you put a viable livestock product
on the shelves
then we will talk about a 20-year plan
to save the world
right now we need to start phase two
and you are the only ones who can do it
we could quit go to hamilton-splinter
newstead owns our patents
wed lose everything
well what
im not spending the next five years
digging through pig shit for enteric proteins
me neither
what the profile
jane doe
anonymous female donor
clean medical and heredity the usual
a dime a dozen
one in a million
it not working
what enzyme are you using
it not the cleavage
theyre digesting fine
so
the human alu sequences
dont wanna bond with foreigners
so what well use a ligase other than t4
well make them
oh well just make them
yeah we will you know why
because wired doesnt interview losers
sometimes i forget those
basic scientific principles
this retarded fascist
über music is the fucking problem
got us thinking in circles
youre right
we have been dancing to the wrong beat
try this
m3
it not working
wait a second it happening
why now
i dont know but theyre on fire
we got the right temperature the enzyme
theyre changing partners
everyone dances with everyone
you are bob fucking fosse
all right
biotechnology most startling
breakthrough in decades
on ice
well at least we know
we can do it right
elsa
elsa come on what are you doing
elsa
im too tired for this elsa
come on i dont have the energy
to play with you right now elsa
im not playing around with you
come on hey
what did you recode the locks
i recoded the locks
come on open the door
elsa seriously
you see this is what known
in couples therapy as emotional hijacking
elsa
come on this is illegal were gonna
go to jail for this open the door
human cloning is illegal
this wont be human not entirely
what what are you doing
relax we wont take it to term
we need to know if we can
generate a sustainable embryo
then we destroy it no one will know
what the point if you cant publish
to be sure we really did it
to know for sure
youre telling me you dont need to know
this is not so simple
there are moral considerations
millions of people are suffering
and dying with no hope
we might have the key to saving them
what are the moral considerations
of that
fuck
exactly
how it coming little brother
good
how fred doing
our boy is growing up into
a fine young man
and phase two
dont worry well nail that gene
good man double helix ha ha
hey uh i cant help
but wonder what you and elsa
have been so busy with
building you your very own
special friend gavin
thank you
i have been so lonely
not for long
come on come on come on
can you not do that
can you not do that
hmm
dont do that
what
dont do that
my zeppelin interpolation come on
you dont like it
zeppelin crashed and burned before
i was born
check this out it near the distillery
i fucking love it
yeah it cool
you dont sound that enthusiastic
i dont know i just dont want to
move again any time soon
weve been here for seven years
no i mean from that place
it just doesnt seem big enough
it twice the size of this apartment
more than enough room for all our stuff
but you know for down the road
you are talking about a kid arent you
that so unreasonable
yeah
because im the one who has to have it
look i love this place
i dont wanna bend my life to suit some
third party that doesnt even exist yet
come on come here
what the worst that can happen
how about after we crack
male pregnancy
ha ha and ruin this perfect figure
youre a hypocrite youre a hypocrite
no youre a hypocrite
who is it
ignore it
what
it beti
holy shit what going on
it coming out
what it cant do that
it not due for months

oh god it huge
i thought you were keeping tabs
i was

too much pressure itll kill it
okay okay were gonna
have to do this manually

a mistake
do you think it in pain
what
it not formed right
we dont know that
im gonna kill it
wait
there still a lot we can learn
we can find out how close we came
to something sustainable
clive
it okay
it all right
it not all right
it wrong
do we have to do this
you dont have to ill take care of it
jesus i think it dead

wait
dont kill it
elsa get out okay im hitting the gas
im not gonna hurt you
in three two one
clive i said dont
put your fucking mask back on elsa
listen goddamn it
you never listen to me
put your damn mask on it dangerous
elsa please
im not gonna hurt you
it imprinting
youre really something arent you
come on come on get out
get out get out how about listening
are you crazy huh
are you trying to get yourself killed
i had the situation under control
you had it under control
youre forgetting why we came here
you know what
we cant do that now all right look at it
what that supposed to mean
let just knock it out with some ether
find out what weve got
this is unbelievable
i dont even know what half of this is
there must be some rogue elements
junk genes pushing through
be careful with that
it some kind
of self-defense mechanism
yeah or attack venom
none of her animal components
have predatory characteristics
well there the human element
what are these
lungs
no these are the lungs
tumors
well i guess well find out
in the autopsy
this wasnt supposed to go this far
it wasnt even supposed to go full-term
but it did
what happened to
were just gonna prove we can do it
so what are you saying
you really gonna kill it hmm
do you think you can do that
look
it growing fast
yeah it aging fast
days within a matter of minutes
you think it the ambystoma gene
it might be
the point is this thing
gonna die soon anyway
were gonna get to observe its entire
life-cycle in compressed time
well never get an opportunity
like this again
so it dying
she dying all by herself
estrogen level been low these days
what
how long
what are you talking about what do
you mean these days are you sure
of course i did all the tests
the progesterone testosterone estradiol
it all in the logs
im sorry ive had a uh
im a little worn out
so uh i guess that thing
that experiment you got going on
youre still not ready to talk about it
how do you listen to this crap
what is this
what were you saying
nothing
day seven
weve got h-50 on a diet of chlorophyll
roughage bean curd and enriched starch
youre gonna eat this youre gonna
just a little bit please okay
come on just a little please
just stop stop just stay still
she seems resistant to feeding
though her rapid growth should
generate a proportionate appetite
youre gonna eat it eat it
fuck
god i cant take this thing anymore
this isnt gonna work
this is impossible
come on
come on
bring it over here
okay
listen listen
eat this eat just eat it
good girl
good youre gonna eat that
good see see
this isnt gonna work
she makes too much noise
people will notice
and she stinks
well just feed her with a drip
how you gonna feed her with a drip
shell rip it right out
come on
try it
tracking her feeding habits
weve determined
that the h-50 craves
high-sucrose foodstuffs
elsa couldnt make it
she at the lab holding things together
she um not very happy
with the new directive is she
it was our facility
we were supposed to have autonomy
i know
and um i am sorry
truth is if we dont start projecting profits
big profits soon
newstead in serious trouble
we need capitalization
to move forward
which means that phase two is
not just an option it all weve got
if ginger and fred dont hit a homerun
at the shareholders presentation
we might not even have that
we wont let you down
in the first month since her birth
the h-50 continues to evolve rapidly
emergence of arms and the closing seam
that bisects her body
suggests that she develops
like a fetus outside the womb
early cognitive recognition tests
indicate growing intelligence
still her mind remains
her greatest mystery
where does it go
where does the bear go
yep
that it you got it again
you are such a good girl
you could do this all day couldnt you
okay im gonna try something harder
okay
so really concentrate
el-s-a
el-s-a elsa
el-s-a
show me elsa
that it
nerd
yeah im a nerd
yeah you made a connection
you are such a good girl oh my god
she did it ha ha
what going on
she can associate
why is the cover off her tail
what is she doing in this room
you cant let her out
what the problem
the problem
specimens need to be contained
dont call her that
what do you want me to call her
dren dren
her name dren
listen youre talking to her
like she a
youre treating her like a
a pet
im compiling a developmental profile
she needs more stimulation than that room
oh well that great
you know what barlow said
theyre renovating this entire wing
tomorrow
so we move her to the storage room
downstairs nobody ever goes down there
how do you know nobody goes there
have you ever
goddamn door
it the best idea ive got
what do you want me to say
what the hell do you mean by that
your sarcasm gonna help
when we get caught
were not gonna get caught
yeah breakthroughs come from risk
and so do people in prison
they go to jail because of risks
so you think theyre gonna
renovate the storage room
what theyre gonna install
state-of-the-art mop racks
all they need to do is open the door
youre gonna risk our career on the fact
that somebody wont open a goddamn door
it the best idea ive got okay
i mean what else do you want me to say
why are we taking all these risks
all of a sudden what is going on
when did you get so fucking scared
when the fuck did you
stop being a scientist
no
stop you go to your place
go to your place
no gavin
it okay
get away from me
she not gonna hurt you
okay so we have to deal with this
come on
all right
it okay dren it all right
itll just be a minute all right shh shh
i dont know about this
you got a better idea
go go go open the door
you stop it shh
starting to feel like a criminal
scientists push boundaries
at least the important ones do
sticking to a few rules isnt always
such a bad idea either you know
nobody is gonna care about a few rules
after they see what we have made
see what weve made
is that what you just said
yeah
nobody can see what we made
once they see ginger and fred
the world will wanna know what next
do you think they could
really look at this face
and see anything less than a miracle
oh oh oh sweetie
sweetie youre sick oh no
clive she really hot
ive gotta talk to my brother
i know it crazy
but i need your support on this
do you know what happens
if you get caught
what am i supposed to do
if you go to jail
do you know what happens to this place
to everyone that depends on you
god did you ever think about them
about me
i mean did you think at all
or did you just do what she wanted
it wasnt like that
you could have stopped it at any time
you could have just said no to her
try it some time
it 05 this is serious
you dont know that for sure
i know okay
we have to do something
what
what are we supposed to do
well we have to take her somewhere
what that crazy
well then do something
what
give her a tylenol
shh
come on were biochemists
we can handle this
how
fuck how
what do you do for a fever
cold bath
hurry hurry
come on okay sweetie shh
all right you got her
okay yeah i got her okay it okay
try to be still okay i know i know
aah
dren dren you have to settle down
okay
try to be still
it all right it okay
jesus her passages are closing
she cant breathe do something
what
i dont know
a tracheotomy
with what
in the lab
but there no time look at her
she dying
dren try to look at me look at me
dren look right at me good girl good girl
look at me look at me
now try to breathe i want you to look
right at me dren look right at me
try to look at me
please dren try to look at me
what are you doing let her go
let her go stop it youre killing her
let her go
let her go please clive just let her go
let her go let her go
stop it clive let her go youre ki
stop it
please let her go please let her go
she breathing
she breathing
those werent tumors
she has amphibious lungs
you saved her but how did you know
you did know right
yeah
anyway
we cant mess around anymore
we have to clean this place up make it safe
yeah
yeah i think we can do that
sweetie you have been
such a good girl lately
i have something special for you
hi im jenny
i like cute guys fast cars
and funny little creatures like you
she was my secret friend
i wasnt allowed to have her
so i had to keep her hidden just like you
good night sweetie
she had a big day
she gonna be out like a light
it been a long time
my god i didnt even notice
is that what happens
to couples when they
when they work too hard ha ha
yeah
hmm
hi there
hey
what do we have here
all right
we have to be quiet
l we dont have any uh
what the worst that could happen
shit
here is a couple unlike any other
weve seen before
that they are completely unique
in the world
is more than just fate
more than just luck
it is by design
now let me present to you the minds
behind the design
splice masters extraordinaire
clive nicoli and elsa kast
thank you ahem
thank you very much
thank you
there been a lot of talk tonight
about advancements in uh
multispecies morphogens
weve talked about our new
protein-based compounds
disease-fighting agents for livestock
and that all very exciting
for everyone at newstead
but let be honest
what exciting for you people
here tonight
is to see these two creatures
alive and in the flesh
these are state-of-the-art designer
organisms the first of their kind
the origin of a species
male and female
like adam and eve
raise the barrier
coming together to enact nature
timeless story of love
do something
uh
well i think we have to agree that
this is a setback in terms of how
it a fucking disaster
what happened
well it was difficult to examine
the remains
but it seems that ginger
has undergone certain
hormonal changes
hormonal changes
she turned into a male
what just like that just changed sex
but how can this happen
we really dont know
but clearly two males caged together
and stressed is a
so your first living hybrid changes sex
and you didnt notice
how is that possible
we can re-create them
no reason not to start over
no more monsters
we dont have time for that
we need the gene that produces cd356
and we need it now
do you understand
we have to get it out of here
yeah and take her where
barlow taking over every inch
of this place man hell find it
gotta find some place
like away from everything
what am i not getting here
what did you expect when you made it
didnt you have a plan
listen brother
we wouldnt be in this mess
if youd been paying enough attention
to observe a fucking gender change
and where were you maestro
i was playing catch-up with
all the work you werent doing
i know a place
all you had to do was track data
i know a place we can take her
all these years youve owned this farm
and you never mentioned it
you knew i grew up on a farm
yeah i didnt know you still had it
it not my farm it was hers
she dead
so is the farm
it all right sweetie
well have you out in a minute okay
you know you can talk to me
about your mother
i dont even want to think about her
i just want to understand
if you could understand crazy
it wouldnt be crazy
it okay honey
there nothing to be afraid of
this is your new home now

everything under control huh
is it really under control now
okay you know what i need you
to calm down we just need to focus
unbelievable this is the disaster
everyone warns about
a new species set loose in the world
dont worry all right
she not gonna leave us
she just did
okay
you know what were gonna find her
she not gonna go far shh shh shh
where is it
go go go

recent violent behavior suggests
dangerous psychological developments
erratic behavior may be caused by
a disproportionate species identification
cosmetically human affectation
should be eliminated wherever possible
due to her unstable condition
it has become necessary
to remove her zootoxin glands
and stinger
what are you doing
what i had to
jesus christ elsa
she become unstable she killed the cat
she almost killed me
so you cut off her tail
you any closer to finding the protein
what does that have to do
with anything
you havent because youre working with
tissue that been dead too long
you dont know she has it
of course she does
she has everything ginger and fred
had and more
where are you going
im gonna solve this thing
im gonna put things right
im sorry
dren
dren im
where are you
bill youre early
let me get this straight
you stay home because youre sick
and now i find you sneaking around
making up for lost time
it too late for that
they wont extend the deadline it over
you screwed us all
in fact clear out clive desk
i dont think so
well no one cares
what you think anymore
youre an embarrassment
to this company it
the protein been synthesized
it in the fridge
when some real scientists get here
have them take a look
ouch
elsa
no no no
no you cant do that you
you shouldnt do that
you shouldnt do that
oh god
oh shit
el
dont
dont
i dont even quite know how it happened
i was barely
i dont even know who you are anymore
youve become something sick
forget about what it means to me
there are some things you do not do
we changed the rules
youre not talking your way out of this
we crossed a line
and things got confused
confused about what
right and wrong
right and wrong
do you have any idea how
naive that sounds
youre in no position to talk to me
about right and wrong
and you are
really
why the fuck did you wanna make her
in the first place
huh
for the betterment of mankind
you never wanted a normal child
because you were afraid
of losing control
but an experiment that something else
i love her
yeah i know but we fucked up el
we fucked up
jesus christ weve chained her up
we locked her away from the world
we maimed her
i maimed her
i just wish things could go back
to the way they were
i synthesized the protein
what
she has a derivative
it more stable than cd356
it 0 times higher than the level
ginger and fred ever had
we could maybe save things
i dont mean us i mean
oh god we cant do that
we cant we have a responsibility
experiment over
our responsibility is to end it
dren

i didnt have to tell him much
you think im stupid
the samples you gave me
had human dna content
they didnt come from ginger and fred
they came from something else
something that still alive
and to think you did this on my watch
now let see this thing
it doesnt belong to you
it doesnt belong to anyone
where is it

what do you want
what do you want
inside
you
your dren turned out to be
a cauldron of unimaginable
chemical mysteries
aside from the intense concentration
of cd356 in her system
she was filled with a variety
of completely unique compounds
well be filing patents for years
of course we are extremely excited
that youre willing to take us
to the next stage
especially in light of the
personal risk
we think the figure weve come up with
is very generous
you can never speak of this
to anyone
ever
nobody would blame you
if you didnt do this
you could just put an end to it
and walk away
what the worst that could happen
