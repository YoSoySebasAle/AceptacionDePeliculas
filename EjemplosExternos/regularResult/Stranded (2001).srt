1
00:00:30,608 --> 00:00:36,531
It's 298 days since the first manned
mission to Mars left the space station.

2
00:00:36,656 --> 00:00:40,826
The space ship Ares and her crew
of seven men and women-

3
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,621
-are now going into orbit
around the red planet.

4
00:00:43,746 --> 00:00:46,249
To make the journey with
the minimum energy requirement-

5
00:00:46,332 --> 00:00:49,794
-after overcoming the Earth's
gravitational velocity-

6
00:00:49,794 --> 00:00:56,759
-the ship entered an orbit around the
sun known as Hohmann's trajectory.

7
00:00:56,884 --> 00:01:00,638
The enigmatic red planet
is home to many mysteries.

8
00:01:00,721 --> 00:01:07,520
In 1999, Mars Global Surveyor failed
to detect a global gravitational field-

9
00:01:07,603 --> 00:01:13,442
-but did find dozens of local fields,
and strange gravitational anomalies.

10
00:01:16,487 --> 00:01:21,576
We have some comments from Andre
Vishniac, captain of the mission-

11
00:01:21,701 --> 00:01:25,538
-received just a few seconds ago
and broadcast to Earth.

12
00:01:25,663 --> 00:01:28,374
This is a historic moment.

13
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,880
Captain...
How do you feel at a time like this?

14
00:01:35,464 --> 00:01:41,596
You're flying over Mars. One of ancient
humanity's dreams has come true.

15
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:45,141
It was a difficult dream to achieve.

16
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:49,020
<i>This is our job,
and we've been trained to do it.</i>

17
00:01:49,103 --> 00:01:51,939
<i>We can't worry about other factors.</i>

18
00:01:52,023 --> 00:01:55,276
<i>Man landed on the Moon
more than 50 years ago.</i>

19
00:01:55,359 --> 00:02:01,324
<i>The next and obvious step was Mars.
But it took longer than expected.</i>

20
00:02:01,324 --> 00:02:06,537
Why Mars?
What do you expect to find there?

21
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:11,334
There is no easy answer to that.
Why does man explore at all?

22
00:02:11,417 --> 00:02:17,173
To learn and to know more.
To prove that we can achieve goals-

23
00:02:17,173 --> 00:02:20,927
-that seemed impossible to reach.

24
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:26,140
-Susana, are you ready?
-Yes, I am.

25
00:02:26,224 --> 00:02:29,143
-Herb?
-Yeah, I'm ready.

26
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,188
Ares...

27
00:02:34,273 --> 00:02:37,401
<i>Commander voice check.</i>

28
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:47,828
<i>Ares, this is the pilot.
Voice check, over.</i>

29
00:02:55,962 --> 00:03:02,093
<i>Ares, this is Herbert.
Voice check, over.</i>

30
00:03:53,102 --> 00:03:56,105
<i>Start countdown.</i>

31
00:03:58,816 --> 00:04:03,946
<i>-...four, three, two, one, zero.
-Ignition.</i>

32
00:07:42,498 --> 00:07:48,421
<i>It was like coming back from the
dead. Confusion and darkness reigned.</i>

33
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,056
<i>Do you read me, Belos?</i>

34
00:07:59,182 --> 00:08:05,104
<i>Belos, do you read me?
Someone answer. Do you read me?</i>

35
00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:09,901
We hear you, Lowell. We've crashed.

36
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:16,908
<i>-Is everyone okay?
-I don't know. I'm okay.</i>

37
00:08:16,991 --> 00:08:21,370
It's pretty crazy here.

38
00:08:21,495 --> 00:08:25,750
The crash was awful.

39
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,091
Are you all right? Are you okay?

40
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:38,387
Get some rest. Don't worry.
Get some rest, okay?

41
00:08:54,445 --> 00:08:57,782
We're alive. Jesus...

42
00:08:58,824 --> 00:09:03,412
It's amazing. We're alive. We did it.

43
00:09:11,337 --> 00:09:18,427
Come on, Johnson.
We did it. We're alive.

44
00:09:20,596 --> 00:09:23,099
Hey, guys...
Is everybody okay down there?

45
00:09:24,475 --> 00:09:28,855
<i>-I'm all right.
-Are you sure, Johnson?</i>

46
00:09:30,523 --> 00:09:33,526
Come on, buddy. We did it.

47
00:09:44,996 --> 00:09:48,040
Vishniac, are you okay?

48
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:52,211
Vishniac?

49
00:09:53,254 --> 00:09:56,591
Vishniac, answer me. Are you okay?

50
00:09:57,508 --> 00:09:59,302
Vishniac...

51
00:09:59,385 --> 00:10:01,470
Jenny!

52
00:10:08,686 --> 00:10:10,771
I don't know...

53
00:10:20,156 --> 00:10:24,619
His neck is broken.
God bless his soul.

54
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:32,877
<i>If anyone finds this tape, I want them
to record the facts as they occurred.</i>

55
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:38,174
<i>The crash was terrible, but the
Belos's cockpit miraculously survived.</i>

56
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:42,762
<i>Our captain, Andre Vishniac,
died on impact.</i>

57
00:10:42,887 --> 00:10:48,518
<i>They five survivors were soon forced
to confront the harsh reality.</i>

58
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:51,854
<i>What lay ahead
wasn't going to be easy.</i>

59
00:10:52,897 --> 00:10:56,317
I can't see anything.

60
00:10:59,028 --> 00:11:02,073
Christ, what a disaster...

61
00:11:02,073 --> 00:11:06,118
We'll never be able
to restore pressure in the hangar...

62
00:11:06,244 --> 00:11:08,746
...and the Rover's a wreck.

63
00:11:10,706 --> 00:11:15,002
<i>We discovered the failure. For a few
seconds, all systems were shut down.</i>

64
00:11:15,002 --> 00:11:18,756
<i>It was enough
to fool the flight computer.</i>

65
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:24,804
<i>-What caused it?
-You'll have to look in your database.</i>

66
00:11:24,887 --> 00:11:29,183
<i>I wish there was something I could do.
Everyone's looking for a way out.</i>

67
00:11:29,267 --> 00:11:32,520
Thanks, Lowell. We'll talk later on.

68
00:11:46,993 --> 00:11:51,289
We need more room.
This is too suffocating.

69
00:11:57,003 --> 00:12:00,047
Sanchez, you're second in command.

70
00:12:00,131 --> 00:12:04,635
With Vishniac dead, you're in charge.
What do you suggest?

71
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:08,681
<i>All I wanted was to be somewhere
else - a million miles away.</i>

72
00:12:08,806 --> 00:12:13,811
First order from your new captain:
You can all lie down and wait.

73
00:12:13,811 --> 00:12:19,233
-Wait? Wait for what?
-You don't want to know, Fidel.

74
00:12:19,317 --> 00:12:24,238
-I refuse to accept that possibility.
-You'd better get used to it, Herb.

75
00:12:24,322 --> 00:12:28,618
There's a ship above our heads,
and it cannot enter our atmosphere.

76
00:12:28,701 --> 00:12:33,915
-There are no more landing modules.
-We expected that, Luca.

77
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:40,171
They'll send a rescue mission.
We only have to stay alive until then.

78
00:12:40,296 --> 00:12:45,092
Rescue mission?
Do you hear what you're saying?

79
00:12:45,092 --> 00:12:50,723
It takes 26 months to send a ship
from Earth. How will they rescue us?

80
00:12:50,806 --> 00:12:54,685
If there's one problem with orbit,
it'll delay that another year.

81
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:58,231
I don't understand. A rescue mission?

82
00:12:58,231 --> 00:13:04,487
The purpose would be to recover our
bodies. We'll be dead within a year.

83
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:09,575
That's where you're wrong, Jenny.
We're going to survive.

84
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:14,580
This descent module wasn't designed
to keep us alive for three years.

85
00:13:14,705 --> 00:13:19,919
We're 191 million kilometers
from Earth, and we're alone.

86
00:13:20,002 --> 00:13:25,132
-There's always a way to survive.
-Any specific ideas?

87
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:30,346
We must get to work. All of us.

88
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:37,728
Our mission now is to survive.
Just as others have survived before.

89
00:13:37,854 --> 00:13:42,441
Our situation is not as desperate
as it might seem at first glance.

90
00:13:42,441 --> 00:13:48,990
Really? Not as desperate?
I love this guy.

91
00:13:49,115 --> 00:13:51,492
I knew a geologist once.

92
00:13:51,617 --> 00:13:56,080
He went on a trip for one day to
Switzerland, and he saw a black cow.

93
00:13:56,205 --> 00:14:02,670
When he came back, he wrote that all
the cows in Switzerland were black.

94
00:14:02,504 --> 00:14:05,424
I'm a geologist, that's true-

95
00:14:05,507 --> 00:14:09,386
-and that's why I know
how to keep my feet on the ground.

96
00:14:09,386 --> 00:14:14,808
We are on Mars, Herb. We're not
going to find palm trees out there.

97
00:14:14,892 --> 00:14:21,481
I don't know what we should do, but
I know that we have to find answers.

98
00:14:21,565 --> 00:14:26,361
-Or die trying.
-What shall we do about water?

99
00:14:26,486 --> 00:14:31,366
Mars's atmosphere contains traces
of water. It's only a matter of time.

100
00:14:31,491 --> 00:14:37,831
Sure, we just have to get used to
not drinking much or breathing much.

101
00:14:37,956 --> 00:14:43,795
Won't you consider the idea that we
may just have a chance of surviving?

102
00:14:46,298 --> 00:14:50,052
All right. I'm listening.
What's your plan? Where do we start?

103
00:14:50,135 --> 00:14:54,014
Precisely as we're doing now.
Assessing our situation.

104
00:14:54,014 --> 00:15:00,896
-We'll need a list of our resources.
-I can give you a general idea.

105
00:15:00,896 --> 00:15:03,815
Go ahead.

106
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:08,695
First of all we need two kilos
of oxygen per person per day.

107
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:14,743
We need approximately two kilos of
water and about 1,5 kilos of solid food.

108
00:15:14,868 --> 00:15:19,957
With the supplies we have on board,
for six people... Maybe one year.

109
00:15:20,082 --> 00:15:24,127
Since the captain's dead - if we're
very careful, we can probably go...

110
00:15:24,253 --> 00:15:30,092
-...fifteen months. That's optimistic.
-Please, go on.

111
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:37,808
All right...

112
00:15:38,725 --> 00:15:44,982
Thanks to the recycling units, we have
enough water for a couple of years.

113
00:15:45,107 --> 00:15:49,987
But if we use the recycler, we're
going to deplete our energy source...

114
00:15:52,823 --> 00:15:55,826
...in about a year.

115
00:15:55,951 --> 00:15:57,911
The problem with oxygen is similar.

116
00:15:58,036 --> 00:16:02,708
In this situation, we'd be too miserable
to be worrying about breathing.

117
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:08,964
We're surrounded by oxygen. The
planet is rusted. That's why it's red.

118
00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:14,094
I got it. But in this atmosphere,
it's in the form of carbon dioxide.

119
00:16:14,178 --> 00:16:18,473
We can separate the oxygen
using dry electrolysis-

120
00:16:18,473 --> 00:16:22,311
-but we'd use too much energy.

121
00:16:22,436 --> 00:16:25,647
The thermoelectric generators
would be depleted in a year.

122
00:16:25,772 --> 00:16:31,820
We could reduce heating, wear our
thermal suits, turn all the lights off...

123
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:37,743
Do you think we can last several years
inside our space suits in the dark?

124
00:16:37,868 --> 00:16:39,119
We'd all go crazy.

125
00:16:39,203 --> 00:16:45,584
We're no longer on a mission to Mars.
We're shipwrecked.

126
00:16:45,667 --> 00:16:50,047
We'll have to accept a great deal
of suffering and discomfort.

127
00:16:50,172 --> 00:16:54,218
Don't worry.
I'm used to facing extreme situations.

128
00:16:54,343 --> 00:16:59,223
-Do I have to call you "sir"?
-No, Jenny. You don't have to.

129
00:17:00,265 --> 00:17:06,730
But now I'm captain of this mission.
Or of the gang of castaways.

130
00:17:06,855 --> 00:17:10,901
-I think we should...
-Excuse me, but it's my turn now.

131
00:17:11,026 --> 00:17:14,571
Luca, I want a detailed inventory
of all our supplies-

132
00:17:14,571 --> 00:17:19,368
-and your estimates as to how we can
make them last as long as possible.

133
00:17:19,451 --> 00:17:24,581
There's another very important thing.
We have to find out what happened.

134
00:17:24,665 --> 00:17:28,418
-Rodrigo, you can take care of that.
-Sure.

135
00:17:28,544 --> 00:17:31,129
Johnson, we need more room.

136
00:17:31,255 --> 00:17:34,675
The acceleration berths won't be
needed anymore. Take them apart.

137
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,220
What about me?
Do you have anything for me to do?

138
00:17:38,345 --> 00:17:42,182
Do you have any idea how to get the
resources we need from the surface?

139
00:17:42,307 --> 00:17:45,227
I'll get working on that right away.

140
00:17:51,984 --> 00:17:56,280
<i>We all set out
on our new mission - survival.</i>

141
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:01,368
<i>Mars was the most inhospitable place
the human mind could ever imagine.</i>

142
00:18:01,493 --> 00:18:06,081
<i>We were determined to use every
available resource to survive.</i>

143
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:11,295
We all know that oxygen is the most
abundant element in the rocks of Mars.

144
00:18:11,295 --> 00:18:15,966
-Is there any way to make use of it?
-I think so.

145
00:18:16,091 --> 00:18:22,639
We'll improvise a silicate reactor
to produce methane and steam.

146
00:18:22,764 --> 00:18:25,475
Steam? Did you say steam?

147
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:31,523
-Where are you going to get energy?
-We wouldn't use our generators.

148
00:18:31,607 --> 00:18:36,737
-So how are you going to do it?
-With fuel from the Belos's engines.

149
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:41,325
We're not planning to take off and
can do what we want with the tanks.

150
00:18:41,408 --> 00:18:45,162
Burning cryogenized fuel...
That sounds very dangerous.

151
00:18:45,287 --> 00:18:50,501
-Luca... Did you hear Herbert's idea?
-Yes, I heard his idea.

152
00:18:50,501 --> 00:18:53,712
-What do you think?
-It's ridiculous.

153
00:18:56,215 --> 00:19:00,594
We don't know what condition the fuel
tanks are in. No one's checked.

154
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:05,098
We're having electrical problems.
The system is not working at all...

155
00:19:05,182 --> 00:19:08,227
...and we're not getting
any feedback signals from the tanks.

156
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:11,230
Let's suppose that they're intact.

157
00:19:11,355 --> 00:19:14,983
If we suppose that they're intact,
which is a bit optimistic...

158
00:19:15,108 --> 00:19:20,197
...we still have to improvise a silicon
reactor from the Belos's engines.

159
00:19:20,322 --> 00:19:23,450
It is not easy,
and a lot of things could go wrong.

160
00:19:23,534 --> 00:19:27,412
We could focus
on more productive things.

161
00:19:28,455 --> 00:19:32,292
But I'm not the captain,
so you make the decision.

162
00:19:35,838 --> 00:19:38,757
Susana.

163
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:47,724
I know where we are. We're way off
the designated landing point.

164
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:52,229
We're right here at the planet's
equator - near zero latitude.

165
00:19:52,312 --> 00:19:58,151
-How can you be so sure?
-The cameras took several pictures.

166
00:19:58,277 --> 00:20:01,196
Let me see them.

167
00:20:05,576 --> 00:20:10,581
-Unbelievable.
-It sure is. Look at this.

168
00:20:13,709 --> 00:20:19,548
It looks like permanent bank of fog
at the bottom of the valley.

169
00:20:19,631 --> 00:20:23,177
It's just at the point nearest to us.

170
00:20:23,302 --> 00:20:27,264
Maybe Ares should take a look at it.
It could be water vapor.

171
00:20:27,264 --> 00:20:34,563
-Could it be of use to us?
-I doubt it. We need more than fog.

172
00:20:34,646 --> 00:20:38,734
-Do you know why we crashed?
-A software error.

173
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:44,364
It lasted only a few seconds,
but it misled the radio altimeter.

174
00:20:45,282 --> 00:20:47,576
Bad luck, I guess.

175
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,719
Luca and Herbert,
start getting ready for EVA.

176
00:21:05,844 --> 00:21:10,098
Take all of this outside, and then
you'll take a look at the engines.

177
00:21:11,141 --> 00:21:17,731
I'll go with them. While they get rid of
this junk, I'll dig a grave for Andre.

178
00:21:17,731 --> 00:21:22,194
What's the point of that? Let's simply
put the captain's body outside.

179
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:26,573
If we lose touch with what we believe
in, soon we'll be acting like animals.

180
00:21:26,698 --> 00:21:31,703
You mean with our superstitions?
Let's focus on things that are practical.

181
00:21:31,787 --> 00:21:36,291
Let's not waste time
digging a useless grave.

182
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:40,045
Let's gather our resources
and make some plans.

183
00:21:40,128 --> 00:21:43,799
Okay, Luca... Nobody asked
you for help. I can do it alone.

184
00:21:43,882 --> 00:21:49,096
We can't assume the responsibility
of taking the captain's body outside.

185
00:21:49,221 --> 00:21:54,101
We could contaminate this planet.
The human body is filled with bacteria.

186
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:58,689
-Do you think bacteria would survive?
-To hell with bacteria!

187
00:21:58,814 --> 00:22:03,277
I don't want to die thinking about
if we're going to leave bacteria behind.

188
00:22:03,402 --> 00:22:08,615
Susana, do I have permission to
bury the captain in a Christian fashion?

189
00:22:20,586 --> 00:22:26,341
Congratulations, Herbert.
You're the first man on Mars.

190
00:23:20,229 --> 00:23:24,733
Baglioni's right.
It's absurd to bury the captain.

191
00:23:35,994 --> 00:23:38,997
Does anybody want to make
a memorable speech?

192
00:23:39,122 --> 00:23:43,293
Why don't you do it, Luca?
You're the brains of this mission.

193
00:23:43,377 --> 00:23:46,839
I think I will, Herbert.

194
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:52,135
How does this sound?

195
00:23:52,261 --> 00:23:56,515
Here lies Andre Vishniac.

196
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,269
He was born on Earth-

197
00:24:00,394 --> 00:24:07,067
-and traveled a long way through
time and space to meet his destiny-

198
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:13,407
-right here,
in this miserable and desolate place.

199
00:24:15,826 --> 00:24:17,995
I'll say a few words.

200
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,583
Wilson wrote them before meeting his
death alongside Scott in the Antarctic.

201
00:24:24,668 --> 00:24:29,798
Do you know what I think?
I think Herbert really is optimistic.

202
00:24:29,882 --> 00:24:34,803
But you are doing your part
- assuming all the responsibility.

203
00:24:34,803 --> 00:24:40,225
I'm sure it must be very hard. Your
position is the most difficult of all.

204
00:24:40,225 --> 00:24:43,145
Do you think I'm a pessimist?

205
00:24:43,228 --> 00:24:48,442
I think you're a strong woman,
and you know what has to be done.

206
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:55,032
-I'm not strong. I can assure you.
-You seem to be.

207
00:24:55,032 --> 00:24:59,411
I've spent all my life pretending.
That's a fair amount of practice.

208
00:24:59,495 --> 00:25:04,500
But right now I'm scared to death.

209
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:09,922
-Don't tell the others.
-It will be our little secret.

210
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:16,178
I wish I was as calm as you.

211
00:25:16,303 --> 00:25:20,057
"Although secrets must be hidden
until God reveals them to man"-

212
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:24,228
-"perhaps we are the ones he chose
to witness for the first time"-

213
00:25:24,311 --> 00:25:27,147
-"the hidden heart
behind the barrier of ice"-

214
00:25:27,231 --> 00:25:31,193
-"and the warmth of the sun under
the brilliant radiance of its rays-"

215
00:25:31,318 --> 00:25:35,697
-"whilst the blizzard scorches and
freezes us with its biting embrace."

216
00:25:43,413 --> 00:25:48,836
I'd like to confess something, Susana.
In my case I'm not so sure.

217
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:53,215
There's something that frightens me
as much as the idea of dying.

218
00:25:53,215 --> 00:25:56,552
Losing my composure,
allowing panic to take over.

219
00:25:56,635 --> 00:25:59,137
That's not going to happen, Fidel.

220
00:25:59,263 --> 00:26:03,934
You'll know how to react,
as well as the rest of us.

221
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:07,396
I'm not a strong man, I can assure you.

222
00:26:07,396 --> 00:26:13,652
But I can't control my curiosity.
That's why I joined the mission.

223
00:26:16,154 --> 00:26:19,783
Okay, good...

224
00:26:19,908 --> 00:26:22,911
Let's go.

225
00:26:30,752 --> 00:26:34,923
We're going to check the tanks.

226
00:26:48,562 --> 00:26:52,649
The first grave on Mars.

227
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:14,755
<i>Luca and Herbert had done
a complete damage report.</i>

228
00:27:14,838 --> 00:27:20,677
<i>There was no need to ask.
It was clear the news was not good.</i>

229
00:27:20,802 --> 00:27:25,807
<i>But Herbert tried to bring us
some hope from the world outside.</i>

230
00:27:25,891 --> 00:27:29,353
It's ice. We've got ice, guys.

231
00:27:29,436 --> 00:27:34,233
-It accumulated in the shade of Belos.
-How can it be water?

232
00:27:34,358 --> 00:27:38,111
The Martian atmosphere
is dry in absolute terms-

233
00:27:38,195 --> 00:27:44,660
-but the cold is so intense that it's
always on the verge of saturation.

234
00:27:44,785 --> 00:27:49,248
Luca... Did you check
the engines and fuel tanks?

235
00:27:49,373 --> 00:27:55,212
They no longer exist. They must
have been thrown off by the crash.

236
00:27:55,295 --> 00:27:59,174
It's a miracle
they didn't blow up and kill us all.

237
00:27:59,258 --> 00:28:03,762
It wasn't a miracle, but a curse.
We are doomed to die.

238
00:28:03,762 --> 00:28:07,391
Even though we keep on breathing
for a year, we are as dead as Andre.

239
00:28:07,516 --> 00:28:12,104
Are you saying that there's
no cryogenized fuel left?

240
00:28:12,104 --> 00:28:16,358
I'm saying that
the contents of this cabin-

241
00:28:16,483 --> 00:28:21,154
-is all that we have left to survive.

242
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:26,368
I don't think we're going to make it.

243
00:28:26,493 --> 00:28:32,332
What's going on here?
Give us a break, okay?

244
00:28:32,416 --> 00:28:38,255
Is anybody listening to what
I'm saying? This is water.

245
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:42,342
Do you know what it means? Water!

246
00:28:42,426 --> 00:28:46,180
We didn't expect to have it,
but here it is.

247
00:28:46,305 --> 00:28:52,978
The problem isn't water or air.
Our energy will run out within a year.

248
00:28:53,061 --> 00:28:57,024
And there's no way
we can produce any more.

249
00:28:57,149 --> 00:29:01,403
We have to start
saving energy right now.

250
00:29:05,699 --> 00:29:09,536
<i>Our only chance is to reduce energy
consumption to a minimum.</i>

251
00:29:09,661 --> 00:29:12,372
<i>We've already lowered
the inside temperature.</i>

252
00:29:12,456 --> 00:29:15,792
<i>Very well,
we'll have to hope it works.</i>

253
00:29:15,918 --> 00:29:21,965
<i>-Any news on our rescue?
-No. I'll be leaving in two days.</i>

254
00:29:22,591 --> 00:29:26,553
<i>They've called it an alternative
trajectory back to Earth. I'm sorry.</i>

255
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,267
Do they have any idea back on Earth
why we crashed?

256
00:29:32,392 --> 00:29:36,230
<i>So far only theories. Some quite
intriguing ones, but only theories.</i>

257
00:29:36,355 --> 00:29:38,732
-In what way?
-Well...

258
00:29:38,857 --> 00:29:41,860
As you know, Mars has no
planetary magnetic fields.

259
00:29:41,985 --> 00:29:45,948
But it does have magnetic anomalies
and localized gravitations.

260
00:29:46,031 --> 00:29:48,867
<i>There's no satisfactory
explanation for this.</i>

261
00:29:48,951 --> 00:29:54,289
We've detected the strongest anomaly
at the bottom of the Marineris Valley.

262
00:29:54,373 --> 00:30:01,171
It's so strong that it could have
affected Belos's OCR oscillators.

263
00:30:01,255 --> 00:30:07,511
That's not all. There's something
weird hidden under the fog.

264
00:30:07,636 --> 00:30:12,307
Take a look at the new photos,
and look at them carefully.

265
00:30:12,432 --> 00:30:17,104
I'm sorry. I have to go. I have
a long journey back. Good luck.

266
00:30:18,272 --> 00:30:23,902
<i>Lowell's departure left the rest of us
with a deep feeling of solitude.</i>

267
00:30:23,986 --> 00:30:30,242
<i>All our hopes had vanished. We were
victims of an unavoidable tragedy.</i>

268
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:36,498
What's going on?
Has our useless neighbor given up yet?

269
00:30:36,623 --> 00:30:41,837
Don't say that.
It must have been frustrating for him.

270
00:30:41,837 --> 00:30:44,756
-It's breaking my heart.
-What's that?

271
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:50,804
-A shot from a SAR camera.
-"I'm a doctor, Jim. Not an engineer."

272
00:30:50,888 --> 00:30:54,558
Synthetic Aperture Radar.

273
00:30:55,601 --> 00:30:58,937
-What's that?
-I've seen this somewhere before.

274
00:30:59,021 --> 00:31:02,274
-Yeah, so have I.
-It doesn't seem to be natural.

275
00:31:02,274 --> 00:31:06,737
-It looks like a maze.
-I'll compare it with the image bank.

276
00:31:10,908 --> 00:31:16,121
Here it is. This photo was taken
near the south pole of Mars.

277
00:31:16,246 --> 00:31:20,918
Look. They're completely identical.
This is so weird.

278
00:31:21,043 --> 00:31:27,090
On our next trip to Mars, we'll take
some pictures and do investigations.

279
00:31:27,174 --> 00:31:32,304
Unfortunately time is running out
- for all of us.

280
00:31:32,304 --> 00:31:36,683
Was that just another comment,
or your conclusion as engineer?

281
00:31:36,683 --> 00:31:40,854
We need to call a meeting.

282
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:51,782
The minimum amount of time for
a round-trip between Mars and Earth-

283
00:31:51,907 --> 00:31:56,995
-is two and a half years. There's
no way to cut down on this time.

284
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:04,211
I know they'll never get here in time
to save us, but they can't tell us that.

285
00:32:04,294 --> 00:32:09,716
How much time do we have if we
follow the energy saving measures?

286
00:32:12,427 --> 00:32:16,306
We have about
one year and two months.

287
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:22,437
The problem is with the recycling
system. It uses too much energy.

288
00:32:22,563 --> 00:32:25,899
What do you suggest?

289
00:32:25,899 --> 00:32:30,696
We have to accept the
baseline facts - that all five of us-

290
00:32:30,696 --> 00:32:35,367
-cannot survive on this module
for that period of time.

291
00:32:35,492 --> 00:32:40,789
Luca, what you're
saying...is terrible.

292
00:32:43,417 --> 00:32:47,588
You asked for the data,
and these are the cold facts.

293
00:32:47,588 --> 00:32:52,384
The module cannot sustain the
five of us for two and a half years.

294
00:32:52,384 --> 00:32:55,804
How many can survive?

295
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,895
How many?

296
00:33:04,314 --> 00:33:07,650
Two of us.

297
00:33:17,118 --> 00:33:23,082
That's not enough, Luca. Two out
of five doesn't make any sense.

298
00:33:23,166 --> 00:33:27,879
-It's ridiculous.
-It's the way it is.

299
00:33:27,962 --> 00:33:33,801
No, it's not. It's not that way, Luca.
That's a way of giving up.

300
00:33:33,927 --> 00:33:39,432
You're the one who compared
our situation to castaways.

301
00:33:39,557 --> 00:33:43,186
Sometimes castaways
have to make difficult decisions.

302
00:33:43,311 --> 00:33:50,485
Are you crazy? Do you expect us to
draw lots to see who lives or dies?

303
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:57,075
I'm not crazy. In a year and a half,
there will be five frozen bodies here-

304
00:33:57,158 --> 00:34:03,748
-unless three of us stop using water,
air, and the recycling system.

305
00:34:03,748 --> 00:34:08,419
You and everyone else
refuse to accept that. - Right, Herb?

306
00:34:08,545 --> 00:34:13,967
You think you'll go back to Earth like
some hero who never lost his cool-

307
00:34:13,967 --> 00:34:17,804
-and always knew exactly what to do.

308
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:22,517
He's right. We won't admit
the truth, but he's right.

309
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:27,605
I don't plan to commit suicide.
It's against my religion.

310
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:31,693
Does anyone question Luca's numbers?

311
00:34:36,072 --> 00:34:39,409
No one?

312
00:34:39,492 --> 00:34:41,911
Well, then...

313
00:34:41,911 --> 00:34:47,542
Then it's clear that we all accept
that Luca's numbers are accurate.

314
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:50,670
Two of the five of us.

315
00:34:50,753 --> 00:34:54,841
They must be correct. I don't know...

316
00:34:54,924 --> 00:35:00,471
I don't think we should
jump into anything.

317
00:35:01,306 --> 00:35:06,936
What I'm saying is that
we have to take time...

318
00:35:06,936 --> 00:35:11,316
...to think before we make any
decision. Maybe we'll find something.

319
00:35:11,316 --> 00:35:16,946
What, Herbert?
What are we going to find out there?

320
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:23,077
When are you going to get that we're
in the most unlivable place there is?

321
00:35:23,203 --> 00:35:26,956
The Earth's poles are a paradise
compared to where we are.

322
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,836
How do we decide who lives or dies?
How can we make a decision like that?

323
00:35:31,961 --> 00:35:34,964
Why don't we apply
Herbert's example?

324
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:38,843
What did castaways do?
Pull the shortest straw?

325
00:35:38,927 --> 00:35:42,263
Should we decide that way?

326
00:35:53,441 --> 00:35:58,530
I'm the pilot of a space ship
that will never fly again.

327
00:36:01,574 --> 00:36:05,829
Fidel, you're the astro-biologist.

328
00:36:05,954 --> 00:36:10,750
Your skills wouldn't be of any use
in this situation.

329
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:15,004
Herb's skills do him no good either.

330
00:36:15,129 --> 00:36:17,841
But Jenny is a doctor...

331
00:36:19,801 --> 00:36:24,180
...and Luca knows how to keep
this machine running.

332
00:36:24,305 --> 00:36:30,144
The decision has been made.
Luca and Jenny stay.

333
00:36:30,144 --> 00:36:36,192
Rodrigo, Herbert and I...

334
00:36:40,446 --> 00:36:43,783
We'll go outside for a walk.

335
00:36:44,951 --> 00:36:50,165
That's a really euphemistic
way of putting it, Susana.

336
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:55,378
Very intelligent.

337
00:36:56,504 --> 00:36:59,757
You're very intelligent, Luca.

338
00:36:59,757 --> 00:37:03,303
Perhaps the most intelligent of us all.

339
00:37:04,971 --> 00:37:11,227
Did you have it all figured out when
you said that only two would survive?

340
00:37:23,531 --> 00:37:28,536
-I'm sorry. I just can't accept that.
-What can't you accept, Herb?

341
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:31,956
We haven't exhausted every possibility.

342
00:37:33,124 --> 00:37:39,464
If I must die, I will. But not before
having used up all our resources.

343
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:44,052
That's it, Herb. There are none.
Did you hear what I said?

344
00:37:44,177 --> 00:37:48,223
-There are no alternatives.
-There are.

345
00:37:48,348 --> 00:37:54,187
What are there, Herb?
You seem to know everything.

346
00:37:54,187 --> 00:38:00,109
-Listen! What is our main problem?
-Energy. So what?

347
00:38:00,235 --> 00:38:06,699
-Why don't we build a windmill?
-Why didn't I think of that?

348
00:38:06,699 --> 00:38:12,330
That's brilliant! We'll build a windmill
that will get energy-

349
00:38:12,413 --> 00:38:17,335
-and we'll fly back home. The air is
too thin. A windmill won't work.

350
00:38:17,418 --> 00:38:22,841
-I've thought of everything.
-Listen to me now.

351
00:38:22,966 --> 00:38:28,471
There are winds of more than 130
kilometers waiting for us out there.

352
00:38:28,596 --> 00:38:33,393
-We can build it.
-The air is too thin.

353
00:38:33,476 --> 00:38:39,315
I'm a scientist. I've thought of
everything. There are no alternatives.

354
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,071
I'm not going to waste energy and
resources on ideas that won't work.

355
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:49,117
It will lower the chances
of anybody surviving.

356
00:38:49,242 --> 00:38:52,579
-I'm sorry.
-That's so easy for you to say.

357
00:38:52,662 --> 00:38:56,332
-What does that mean?
-You don't understand that?

358
00:38:56,416 --> 00:39:00,587
You're so clever
and you don't understand that?

359
00:39:04,132 --> 00:39:07,677
I'm sorry.

360
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:19,272
I'm not leaving the module.
You can't ask me to do that.

361
00:39:25,945 --> 00:39:30,200
<i>We decided to sleep for five hours
before preparing to leave.</i>

362
00:39:30,325 --> 00:39:33,745
<i>Finally, the moment arrived.</i>

363
00:39:49,093 --> 00:39:51,262
What are those for?

364
00:39:51,387 --> 00:39:56,476
We're taking as many oxygen tanks
as we can carry. Is that a problem?

365
00:40:00,021 --> 00:40:04,400
Susan, do you need that many tanks?

366
00:40:06,611 --> 00:40:13,076
-Please, Luca...
-All right. I'll go upstairs. - Good luck.

367
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:17,455
Good luck. Take care.

368
00:40:21,417 --> 00:40:26,631
-Luca... Take care.
-You too.

369
00:40:41,312 --> 00:40:45,817
-Fidel...
-I'm sorry I arrived late.

370
00:40:45,817 --> 00:40:49,779
-Give me a hand with the suit.
-Sure.

371
00:41:24,606 --> 00:41:27,525
My gloves...

372
00:42:20,912 --> 00:42:24,457
It looks just like
a sunny winter day on Earth.

373
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:29,128
Certainly no one would say
that we are on another world.

374
00:42:40,723 --> 00:42:46,354
It's a great day for a stroll. I wish
we could take these heavy suits off.

375
00:42:46,437 --> 00:42:50,108
That wouldn't be wise, Herb. 80
degrees below zero, 10 REM per year-

376
00:42:50,191 --> 00:42:52,694
-and virtually no atmospheric pressure.

377
00:42:52,819 --> 00:42:54,988
<i>Come on, guys.</i>

378
00:42:55,113 --> 00:43:02,203
Susana, I was thinking that you
should start up your video cameras.

379
00:43:02,287 --> 00:43:06,457
I can record everything from here.

380
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:13,464
I think they'll be very satisfied on
Earth with the images you can get.

381
00:43:16,384 --> 00:43:21,598
Are you serious, Luca? Won't that use
up too much of the energy reserves?

382
00:43:21,681 --> 00:43:25,977
I've done some calculations,
and I think we can afford it.

383
00:43:25,977 --> 00:43:29,814
I think it'll be worth while.

384
00:43:30,982 --> 00:43:35,153
Giving meaning to their last hours...

385
00:43:35,236 --> 00:43:39,741
It isn't that. I think this is important.

386
00:43:39,824 --> 00:43:44,621
There could be some valuable shots.
I'm not being sentimental.

387
00:43:55,465 --> 00:44:00,386
You're on screen, Susana.
You can say a few words if you want.

388
00:44:01,429 --> 00:44:07,560
You already know our situation.
It isn't worth while repeating it now.

389
00:44:09,145 --> 00:44:13,733
We are going to try to reach
the edge of the Marineris Valley.

390
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:19,239
We've calculated that we'll have
to walk for about four or five hours.

391
00:44:19,364 --> 00:44:22,283
We are carrying
a few spare tanks of oxygen-

392
00:44:22,283 --> 00:44:28,414
<i>-so there is a pretty good chance
that we'll get some good shots.</i>

393
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:32,085
<i>Hope you enjoy them.</i>

394
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:50,414
Wait a minute. Let's stop here.

395
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:55,711
-I need to replace an oxygen tank.
-Okay, I'll help you.

396
00:45:55,836 --> 00:46:00,090
How many more daylight hours
do we have?

397
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:06,763
Judging by the position of the sun...
I guess about two, maybe three.

398
00:46:06,888 --> 00:46:10,642
Exactly four hours, Herb.

399
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:14,479
<i>How far are we
from the edge of the valley?</i>

400
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:19,818
You've already covered
three quarters of the distance.

401
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:24,614
Oh, God...

402
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:30,329
-Susana, is everything okay?
-Yeah.

403
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:49,514
<i>The landscape seemed to have been
carved out by catastrophic floods.</i>

404
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:55,687
<i>Millions of years ago, that dry surface
could have been a deep chasm.</i>

405
00:46:55,771 --> 00:47:01,818
<i>The untamed beauty of Mars - its icy
indifference took our breath away.</i>

406
00:47:01,943 --> 00:47:08,909
<i>We were the first creatures to ever
set foot on that alien terrain.</i>

407
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:13,914
<i>A mere anecdote
in the midst of that red desolation.</i>

408
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:39,356
Have you ever seen such beauty?

409
00:47:39,481 --> 00:47:44,778
More than 4,000 kilometers long
and 300 wide.

410
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:47,698
There's nothing like it
in the entire solar system.

411
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:50,409
Look at those strata.

412
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:57,499
I don't know if the video image will
record the subtle colors. It's beautiful.

413
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:01,670
It's quite clear, Susana.

414
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:16,893
Did they reach the valley yet?

415
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:35,245
This place is beautiful.

416
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:42,044
You might think that just getting here
has made it all worth while.

417
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:45,047
Look over there.

418
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,758
Yeah...

419
00:48:48,925 --> 00:48:54,848
-We could try to make it to the fog.
-The ravine is eight kilometers deep.

420
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:59,353
But the gravity on this planet
is a third of what it is on Earth.

421
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:04,232
It isn't as difficult as it seems.
- What do you think, Susana?

422
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:09,237
-Let's go down and take a look.
-All right. Why not?

423
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:13,116
Let's go. We don't have time to waste.

424
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:19,039
Is that a joke? It's just the fact that
I'm tired that keeps me from crying.

425
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,835
-Oh, God...
-Let's go.

426
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:34,179
Good idea.
Unfortunately it won't work.

427
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:40,644
Their air supply is too insufficient
to make it to the valley.

428
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:43,647
Are you nuts?

429
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:48,443
I've turned off the microphone.
Don't worry.

430
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:55,742
-Besides, they already know.
-There's no need to remind them.

431
00:49:56,702 --> 00:50:03,583
-Do you think our situation is better?
-We have a possibility of surviving.

432
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:07,754
We have a possibility,
if you listen to me.

433
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:14,219
A few years ago,
I dated a guy like you.

434
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:20,058
He thought he was the smartest guy
in the world, but he was a jerk.

435
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:23,478
So you've had one boyfriend?

436
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:28,692
Fuck you, Luca. Fuck you!

437
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:41,538
This is a form of madness -
nothing more, nothing less.

438
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:47,586
All of us are crazy. Otherwise
we would have stayed on Earth.

439
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:52,382
What would make a sane man
leave his wife and children-

440
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:57,262
-and climb down a deep ravine
on the equator of a frozen planet?

441
00:50:57,387 --> 00:51:03,226
We must all be reasonably sane,
or we wouldn't have passed the tests.

442
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:06,021
I lied. I wanted to come here.

443
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:11,985
I was crazy enough to lie, but
intelligent enough not to get caught.

444
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:18,241
<i>-Did you lie, too?
-No, I answered truthfully.</i>

445
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:23,038
<i>Hey, guys...
Remember that all this is being taped.</i>

446
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:29,294
<i>Some day you will be on TVon Earth.
So, careful what you say.</i>

447
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:35,634
They wouldn't do anything to harm the
image. They'll portray us as heroes.

448
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:40,972
-With luck we'll all be on a pedestal.
-Shut up, Luca.

449
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:45,644
You are living proof
that psychological tests don't work.

450
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,938
What about your team spirit?

451
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:52,526
I guess I lied.
As I'm sure everybody else did.

452
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:58,907
<i>-Except for Herbert.
-I didn't lie, Luca. I didn't need to.</i>

453
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:05,998
Perhaps you're the only one who isn't
saying, "What an idiot I was".

454
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:09,960
I wonder how they'll see us on TV.

455
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:14,423
What thoughts will be running through
the minds of the people watching this?

456
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,842
I've seen similar situations.

457
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:22,055
You're sitting in your living room,
drinking coffee after lunch-

458
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:27,060
-and suddenly they broadcast images
of just before a disaster.

459
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:32,482
You see people who will be dead soon,
and you wonder how they feel.

460
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:35,902
What keeps them going?

461
00:52:36,028 --> 00:52:40,615
-Have you found out?
-No, not at all.

462
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:44,244
I feel like I'm seeing this on TV.

463
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:49,041
I can't accept
that this is happening to me.

464
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:53,837
My mind can't fathom that my air
supply will run out in a few hours-

465
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:57,799
-and that it will be
the end of the road.

466
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:04,598
I'd like to suggest something. How
about concentrating on the descent?

467
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:09,686
As we talk, we're using up
more oxygen than necessary.

468
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:16,693
<i>The escarpment was what geologists
call a chaotic region.</i>

469
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:21,365
<i>The path had been carved out
by a torrential flow of water-</i>

470
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:25,535
<i>-sometime in the Martian past.</i>

471
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:36,922
Wait a second.
I need to replace a tank.

472
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:40,342
I'll help you.

473
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:45,055
-Let's stop here, Susana.
-Okay.

474
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:50,560
It's your last bottle.

475
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:54,022
Calm down.
You're using too much oxygen.

476
00:53:54,106 --> 00:53:56,608
Yeah, I know.

477
00:53:56,733 --> 00:54:02,030
-Are you all right?
-Everything's fine.

478
00:54:14,794 --> 00:54:20,008
<i>Herbert was on his last oxygen bottle,
and we didn't have much more.</i>

479
00:54:20,133 --> 00:54:24,595
<i>We knew we were nearing the end
of the road, but no one said a word.</i>

480
00:54:24,721 --> 00:54:29,308
<i>We simply concentrated
on taking one step at a time.</i>

481
00:54:43,698 --> 00:54:46,200
Look at that.

482
00:54:46,284 --> 00:54:50,371
-What?
-Phobos.

483
00:54:50,455 --> 00:54:56,419
-It's moving as fast as a satellite.
-It's so beautiful.

484
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:03,176
And Demios is that brilliant star
right next to the edge.

485
00:55:03,301 --> 00:55:09,849
-It doesn't look that spectacular.
-It doesn't matter, Rodrigo.

486
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:14,020
-They are the moons of Barsoom.
-Barsoom?

487
00:55:15,605 --> 00:55:18,608
Shall we continue?

488
00:55:19,859 --> 00:55:23,529
<i>Barsoom.
That was the name given to Mars-</i>

489
00:55:23,613 --> 00:55:26,449
<i>-by the inhabitants
of the Empire of Helium-</i>

490
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:30,078
<i>-ruled by the beautiful princess
Dejah Thoris-</i>

491
00:55:30,203 --> 00:55:37,293
<i>-and where Tars Tarkas, the warrior
with green skin and four arms, fights.</i>

492
00:55:37,293 --> 00:55:41,881
<i>Herbert explained this to us
as we continued our descent.</i>

493
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:46,969
<i>And he told us
about the spired cities of Helium-</i>

494
00:55:47,095 --> 00:55:51,683
<i>-and the emerald green banks
of the great canal of Nylosirtis.</i>

495
00:55:51,766 --> 00:55:58,856
-What are you talking about, Herb?
-John Carter's adventures on Mars.

496
00:55:58,982 --> 00:56:03,236
My grandfather had all
Edgar Rice Burroughs's novels.

497
00:56:03,361 --> 00:56:08,032
The Tarzan books
and those of John Carter.

498
00:56:08,157 --> 00:56:11,577
But the Carter ones
were my favorites.

499
00:56:11,703 --> 00:56:17,750
As a child, I spent hours
devouring those marvelous novels.

500
00:56:17,834 --> 00:56:24,090
I dreamt of someday visiting the
kingdom of princess Dejah Thoris-

501
00:56:24,215 --> 00:56:29,429
-and walking under
the two wild moons of Barsoom.

502
00:56:52,368 --> 00:56:55,705
You two will have to go it alone.

503
00:56:56,831 --> 00:57:00,376
I think I'll stay here for a while.

504
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:05,798
What are you talking about?
What's the matter, Herb?

505
00:57:05,923 --> 00:57:12,472
I can't go on.
My air supply has run out.

506
00:57:12,597 --> 00:57:17,060
I swear to you that I'd like to...

507
00:57:17,185 --> 00:57:20,313
...but I can't.

508
00:57:23,524 --> 00:57:28,321
We knew that this moment
would come, didn't we?

509
00:57:28,446 --> 00:57:32,825
Susana, didn't we?

510
00:57:32,909 --> 00:57:38,665
You're a good person.

511
00:57:38,748 --> 00:57:45,004
We should have gotten
to know each other better.

512
00:58:05,775 --> 00:58:11,906
The only happy people are those who
have made their dreams come true.

513
00:59:56,302 --> 01:00:00,682
<i>It was all over.
What were we doing?</i>

514
01:00:00,765 --> 01:00:05,979
<i>Why were we continuing on down,
stubbornly, pointlessly-</i>

515
01:00:06,104 --> 01:00:09,107
<i>-towards our own graves?</i>

516
01:00:09,232 --> 01:00:15,154
<i>Herbert was back there -
alone under the moons of Barsoom.</i>

517
01:00:15,279 --> 01:00:18,408
<i>He was the best of us all.</i>

518
01:00:23,705 --> 01:00:28,835
Fidel?

519
01:00:30,586 --> 01:00:33,631
Susana?

520
01:00:35,091 --> 01:00:40,304
Can you hear me? I can't get any
images. I'm not seeing anything.

521
01:00:40,304 --> 01:00:43,099
I'm getting interference.

522
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:59,490
It looks like the end of the road.
We can't carry along here.

523
01:01:00,616 --> 01:01:02,702
Oh, shit!

524
01:01:04,287 --> 01:01:07,498
Do we have to retrace
the whole route?

525
01:01:07,623 --> 01:01:10,001
Not me.

526
01:01:16,591 --> 01:01:22,638
<i>There was no way out.
But suddenly I saw it.</i>

527
01:01:22,722 --> 01:01:27,310
<i>I realized immediately that there
was something strange in that cave.</i>

528
01:01:27,435 --> 01:01:31,898
<i>The slope we had followed
led straight to it.</i>

529
01:01:32,023 --> 01:01:38,363
<i>-Susana?
-Luca? Jenny? Do you read me?</i>

530
01:01:38,488 --> 01:01:41,824
<i>-I can't get...
-Luca?</i>

531
01:01:48,289 --> 01:01:51,709
Fidel, you have to see this.

532
01:01:51,834 --> 01:01:55,046
Wait, I'm coming.

533
01:02:03,721 --> 01:02:08,393
Can you hear me?
I can't get any images.

534
01:02:08,518 --> 01:02:11,729
I'm getting interference.

535
01:02:18,194 --> 01:02:20,822
Shit!

536
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:32,166
What does that mean?

537
01:02:53,563 --> 01:02:56,357
We're dead.

538
01:03:02,405 --> 01:03:04,824
I don't know. What the hell...

539
01:03:10,455 --> 01:03:15,335
-What are you doing?
-We can stop conserving energy.

540
01:03:17,337 --> 01:03:23,593
We have a leak. It's not as airtight
as I thought. We're losing air.

541
01:03:23,676 --> 01:03:26,512
The pilot indicator...

542
01:03:27,638 --> 01:03:31,100
...indicates that the
internal pressure has dropped.

543
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:35,271
I don't understand why the sensors
didn't warn us before.

544
01:03:35,355 --> 01:03:38,900
Maybe they broke in the crash.

545
01:03:40,485 --> 01:03:45,156
We can try to locate the leak,
seal it, and re-establish pressure.

546
01:03:45,281 --> 01:03:51,537
No, my calculations were precise,
and were based on an airtight cabin.

547
01:03:51,537 --> 01:03:55,375
I hadn't foreseen that we
would lose air because of a leak.

548
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:59,671
That variable was not included
in my equation.

549
01:03:59,754 --> 01:04:06,844
The outcome couldn't be worse.
Even if we could plug the crack-

550
01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:13,851
-we wouldn't have enough air
to wait for a rescue mission.

551
01:04:13,851 --> 01:04:20,942
I refuse to give up.
I'll find the damn leak and plug it!

552
01:04:21,025 --> 01:04:24,487
-Jenny...
-What?

553
01:04:24,487 --> 01:04:30,827
It's useless. The pressure's going down.
Perhaps the crack is getting bigger.

554
01:04:31,995 --> 01:04:37,291
The leak will be visible from the
outside as a streak of water vapor.

555
01:04:38,251 --> 01:04:44,090
There's no hope.
Believe me. There's no hope.

556
01:04:45,133 --> 01:04:49,387
I don't want to spend my last hours
in a pressurized suit-

557
01:04:49,512 --> 01:04:55,226
-waiting for the air to disappear.
Listen, Jen. Please...

558
01:04:55,351 --> 01:05:02,650
-I don't...
-What do you want to do? Tell me.

559
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:09,741
We just admit
that we're going to die-

560
01:05:09,824 --> 01:05:14,412
-and just come together,
come towards each other...

561
01:05:14,537 --> 01:05:18,374
We can make each other feel good
and it would be okay.

562
01:05:18,499 --> 01:05:22,128
I don't want to be alone
and just sit here waiting to die.

563
01:05:22,253 --> 01:05:25,798
Why don't we just make each other
feel good? We can be together.

564
01:05:25,882 --> 01:05:30,053
How much time
do we really have left?

565
01:05:30,178 --> 01:05:33,806
I think about twelve hours.

566
01:05:33,931 --> 01:05:37,894
Any thoughts like this the whole
voyage... Have you just avoided...?

567
01:05:37,894 --> 01:05:42,482
Do you mean that with your enormous
talent and amazing intelligence-

568
01:05:42,565 --> 01:05:47,153
-you can't find any other solution
than to die fucking?!

569
01:05:51,115 --> 01:05:57,163
That's completely unreasonable.
That's so uptight.

570
01:05:57,288 --> 01:06:01,334
Listen, Jenny. Listen to me.

571
01:06:01,459 --> 01:06:08,007
I've thought about this a lot.
I think we can adapt together.

572
01:06:08,132 --> 01:06:13,221
Let me tell you what we're going
to do. My plan, okay?

573
01:06:13,346 --> 01:06:20,019
I'll get into my pressurized suit
and go outside to locate the leak.

574
01:06:20,103 --> 01:06:25,108
I don't care if it's a waste of time. At
least I'll feel that I'm doing something.

575
01:06:25,233 --> 01:06:30,113
You can stay in here and masturbate
until you die of dehydration.

576
01:06:30,238 --> 01:06:34,409
When the rescue mission arrives,
that's how they'll find you.

577
01:06:34,409 --> 01:06:39,497
They may even erect a statue of you
on the same spot.

578
01:06:46,796 --> 01:06:51,175
It doesn't seem to be
a natural phenomenon.

579
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:53,469
What do you mean?

580
01:06:53,594 --> 01:06:59,100
I don't understand how nature could
have created a cave like this.

581
01:06:59,225 --> 01:07:04,105
It's kind of artificial, like a tunnel
dug by an intelligent being.

582
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:10,153
-The walls are smooth, almost perfect.
-There could be many explanations.

583
01:07:10,278 --> 01:07:14,324
An ancient frozen water course could
have perforated the rock this way.

584
01:07:14,449 --> 01:07:19,329
Like an underground glacier.
Then the ice melted...

585
01:07:23,416 --> 01:07:29,672
It's incredible, Fidel.
Can you see this? Amazing!

586
01:07:29,672 --> 01:07:36,971
There are symbols carved in the stone.
It seems to be some kind of writing.

587
01:07:41,142 --> 01:07:46,439
They have angles, as if they have been
carved by an intelligent being.

588
01:07:46,564 --> 01:07:48,650
Oh, my God!

589
01:07:52,487 --> 01:07:57,283
It's man-made, there's no doubt
about it, but I still can't believe it.

590
01:08:00,328 --> 01:08:03,456
Oh, my God...!

591
01:08:05,124 --> 01:08:12,632
-Someone built it.
-"Someone..." It's incredible.

592
01:08:12,715 --> 01:08:18,763
Oh, my God. We can't complain
about it. We have no right to.

593
01:08:18,888 --> 01:08:22,850
We've discovered the remains
of an ancient civilization.

594
01:08:22,934 --> 01:08:28,898
-There are more symbols in the stone.
-Susana, I'm really seeing them.

595
01:08:28,982 --> 01:08:33,695
Oh, God. It's unbelievable.

596
01:08:34,737 --> 01:08:38,074
Oh, God...

597
01:08:48,584 --> 01:08:54,549
<i>Fidel had devoted his career to
proving the feasibility of life on Mars.</i>

598
01:08:54,632 --> 01:08:59,012
<i>We had stumbled across evidence
he would have never dared dream of.</i>

599
01:08:59,137 --> 01:09:05,268
<i>But we wondered if that discovery
would die along with us.</i>

600
01:09:51,564 --> 01:09:55,026
-What do you think you're doing?
-I must find that leak.

601
01:09:55,109 --> 01:10:01,699
Don't waste your time, Jen.
We've lost too much air.

602
01:10:01,699 --> 01:10:05,119
"Must find the leak..."

603
01:10:05,244 --> 01:10:10,249
-We have to keep fighting.
-Jen, look at me.

604
01:10:10,333 --> 01:10:17,006
Admit it. We're going to die.
Just admit it.

605
01:10:17,131 --> 01:10:20,134
Leave me alone.

606
01:10:20,259 --> 01:10:23,805
I don't want to die.

607
01:10:44,951 --> 01:10:47,870
Too bad we didn't bring
an archeologist with us.

608
01:10:47,996 --> 01:10:52,875
An archeologist would murder us
for not taking precautions-

609
01:10:53,001 --> 01:10:57,797
-before coming in here and distorting
everything with our fingerprints.

610
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:03,219
-What do you mean?
-The ground is covered in dust.

611
01:11:03,302 --> 01:11:08,850
-How long will our footprints last?
-A thousand years, maybe.

612
01:11:09,767 --> 01:11:14,355
This tunnel goes down. Do you think
it will reach the bottom of the valley?

613
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:19,152
It's possible,
but it's 8,000 meters deep.

614
01:11:19,277 --> 01:11:22,405
I can't believe we're here.

615
01:11:48,473 --> 01:11:51,476
What's happening?

616
01:11:53,144 --> 01:11:58,775
-The air pressure is higher here.
-Your pressure gauge must be broken.

617
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:03,780
No, look... There's air and the
oxygen count is almost normal.

618
01:12:03,905 --> 01:12:08,493
We haven't passed any airlock or
registered any pressure increase.

619
01:12:08,576 --> 01:12:12,455
Your instruments must be off.

620
01:12:16,626 --> 01:12:22,131
My air pressure is almost zero.
I don't have much to lose.

621
01:12:22,256 --> 01:12:24,425
Decompression is a horrible way to die.

622
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:30,181
I'm tired, Susana. If this is the end...

623
01:12:30,264 --> 01:12:34,769
Don't do it, Fidel.
Don't leave me alone.

624
01:12:56,958 --> 01:13:02,505
It's cold, and it has a metallic smell.

625
01:13:03,631 --> 01:13:07,385
But you can breathe it
without any problem.

626
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:11,472
But that's impossible.

627
01:13:11,556 --> 01:13:16,269
There's air here,
and sufficient pressure.

628
01:13:16,352 --> 01:13:20,440
Don't ask me how it's possible.

629
01:13:45,256 --> 01:13:48,676
It's true.

630
01:13:48,801 --> 01:13:51,929
Fidel...

631
01:13:52,013 --> 01:13:55,767
If there's sufficient air here...

632
01:13:55,892 --> 01:13:59,312
Yeah, we could survive.

633
01:14:00,897 --> 01:14:06,944
We must find out what this place is,
what it's for.

634
01:14:17,372 --> 01:14:21,334
The pyramids must be recent
in comparison to this place.

635
01:14:21,417 --> 01:14:27,173
The stones around us have been here
longer than we can imagine.

636
01:14:27,256 --> 01:14:31,135
We may never know what it means.

637
01:14:31,219 --> 01:14:36,432
The symbols aren't so strange, con-
sidering they're from an alien culture.

638
01:14:36,557 --> 01:14:41,145
Any race of hunters would have
developed the arrow symbol.

639
01:14:41,145 --> 01:14:44,065
The star and the cross sign
aren't difficult to imagine either.

640
01:14:44,148 --> 01:14:47,902
-The eye of the octopus.
-What?

641
01:14:48,027 --> 01:14:53,241
Its structure is identical to that of
the human eye - parallel evolution.

642
01:14:54,575 --> 01:14:58,746
Well... Let's go.

643
01:15:00,540 --> 01:15:05,545
Wait, we still have
no contact with Belos.

644
01:15:07,005 --> 01:15:10,633
They can't help us back at the module.

645
01:15:29,944 --> 01:15:36,701
-This place is a maze.
-I feel like an experimental rat.

646
01:15:36,826 --> 01:15:40,997
-I wonder if it means anything.
-It must.

647
01:15:42,332 --> 01:15:47,670
Imagine an ant that wanders into a
discarded Coke bottle looking for food.

648
01:15:47,754 --> 01:15:52,467
It goes round and round until it drops.
Perhaps it thinks-

649
01:15:52,550 --> 01:15:56,846
-that such a strange and
beautiful place must have a purpose.

650
01:15:56,929 --> 01:16:00,475
But these symbols
must have a meaning.

651
01:17:17,803 --> 01:17:21,223
Fidel, don't leave me.

652
01:17:26,437 --> 01:17:32,901
-The corridor is a vacuum, isn't it?
-Yeah.

653
01:17:36,155 --> 01:17:41,035
How did they do it? How can it be?

654
01:17:43,746 --> 01:17:47,207
Please, Fidel. Don't leave me.

655
01:17:47,207 --> 01:17:52,921
Susana... I'm so very tired.

656
01:17:54,798 --> 01:17:58,052
Fidel, don't leave me. Please.

657
01:19:18,841 --> 01:19:24,263
<i>I'm recording everything I can see
with my camera...</i>

658
01:19:26,890 --> 01:19:30,227
<i>...but I can't transmit anything.</i>

659
01:19:31,145 --> 01:19:35,316
<i>You'll only be able
to see these shots...</i>

660
01:19:39,403 --> 01:19:44,074
<i>...if someone bothers
to look for my corpse.</i>

661
01:19:47,745 --> 01:19:53,667
<i>Alone, more alone than any other
human being had ever been-</i>

662
01:19:53,792 --> 01:19:59,840
<i>-in a strange place, where some
mysterious technology was operating.</i>

663
01:19:59,923 --> 01:20:05,679
<i>Something was keeping the air inside,
and perhaps it was that something-</i>

664
01:20:05,763 --> 01:20:10,768
<i>-that caused the magnetic
and gravitational anomalies.</i>

665
01:20:10,893 --> 01:20:15,481
<i>Perhaps the anomalies indicated
the position of mazes like this-</i>

666
01:20:15,564 --> 01:20:20,569
<i>-scattered over the surface of Mars.
But I was lost inside.</i>

667
01:20:20,694 --> 01:20:28,410
<i>Wandering alone through a place that
had already claimed my partner's life.</i>

668
01:20:28,494 --> 01:20:32,581
<i>I had been going around in circles
for hours-</i>

669
01:20:32,665 --> 01:20:38,712
<i>-and thought that Rodrigo was right,
that there was no logic behind it.</i>

670
01:20:38,837 --> 01:20:44,760
<i>Perhaps it was just a rat trap, or...
Who knows?</i>

671
01:20:45,803 --> 01:20:50,182
<i>The only thing I knew for sure was
that there was no air or pressure-</i>

672
01:20:50,307 --> 01:20:53,102
<i>-in the corridors marked with a star.</i>

673
01:20:55,104 --> 01:21:01,235
I do hope that these arrows
are taking me in the right direction.

674
01:21:07,825 --> 01:21:10,536
But nothing is certain.

675
01:21:36,186 --> 01:21:39,940
Rodrigo? Is that you?

676
01:22:40,709 --> 01:22:45,631
Two arms. Two legs.

677
01:22:46,757 --> 01:22:50,928
It all seems pretty human.

678
01:22:51,971 --> 01:22:56,475
But who knows
what it looked like originally?

679
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:10,090
All I need is a small trace of vapor
to locate where the air is escaping.

680
01:24:10,174 --> 01:24:13,093
All I need is a small trace...

681
01:24:28,651 --> 01:24:31,445
This is impossible.

682
01:25:06,397 --> 01:25:10,234
Jenny? Jenny?

683
01:25:13,487 --> 01:25:17,116
-Jenny?
-I'm here.

684
01:25:22,538 --> 01:25:27,334
Yes, that's it. It's Susan's signal.

685
01:25:27,459 --> 01:25:32,673
-Is it possible?
-No, it's not possible.

686
01:25:36,427 --> 01:25:42,057
But that's the signal.
She can't be alive. It's impossible.

687
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:46,937
<i>Jenny? Luca?</i>

688
01:25:50,607 --> 01:25:52,568
<i>Can you copy?</i>

689
01:25:52,693 --> 01:25:55,612
We copy, but we don't have an image.

690
01:25:55,612 --> 01:26:02,786
<i>You must try to make it over here.
There's air here, for everyone.</i>

691
01:26:02,911 --> 01:26:04,997
<i>Over here.</i>

692
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:10,919
<i>-And Rodrigo?
-He didn't make it. He's dead.</i>

693
01:26:11,045 --> 01:26:14,798
<i>But you...survive.</i>

694
01:26:14,882 --> 01:26:19,470
<i>-Breathable air here.
-I think she's crazy.</i>

695
01:26:19,595 --> 01:26:25,934
-Could she still be alive?
-If Rodrigo gave her some oxygen.

696
01:26:26,977 --> 01:26:33,025
-Or if she took it from him.
-What are you trying to say?

697
01:26:33,150 --> 01:26:37,613
I don't know.
Maybe she's hallucinating.

698
01:26:39,698 --> 01:26:44,411
-We could try to reach her.
-Could we?

699
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:51,919
We have one hour of oxygen
on the ship.

700
01:26:52,002 --> 01:26:55,881
We have two space suits
with oxygen tanks filled.

701
01:26:55,965 --> 01:27:00,469
And we have the one
from the captain.

702
01:27:00,469 --> 01:27:02,846
I think we can make it.

703
01:27:02,972 --> 01:27:06,934
I thought you didn't want to die
in a space suit.

704
01:27:08,602 --> 01:27:14,108
I've come to the conclusion
that no death is good.

705
01:27:14,233 --> 01:27:18,821
I want to find out
what happened to Susan.

706
01:27:20,781 --> 01:27:23,617
Come on.

707
01:28:17,838 --> 01:28:24,094
I need to rest for a while. These suits
were not designed for long walks.

708
01:31:33,284 --> 01:31:35,662
You're alive!

709
01:31:36,705 --> 01:31:40,166
<i>Vivo.
- Jenny!</i>

710
01:31:44,546 --> 01:31:47,257
It's crazy.

711
01:32:02,355 --> 01:32:06,443
<i>So this, my friends,
is the bottom of the Marineris Valley.</i>

712
01:32:06,526 --> 01:32:09,029
<i>It's been tough getting down here.</i>

713
01:32:09,154 --> 01:32:13,533
<i>Herb and Fidel died
without even seeing it.</i>

714
01:32:14,367 --> 01:32:21,666
<i>But this place could mean hope for us.
There's water, air, and organic life.</i>

715
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:27,380
<i>A primitive lichen species that we
may be able to extract proteins from.</i>

716
01:32:28,548 --> 01:32:32,719
<i>So there you have it. It's a fact.</i>

717
01:32:32,802 --> 01:32:39,809
<i>Mars was inhabited millions of
years ago. A civilization thrived here.</i>

718
01:32:42,937 --> 01:32:48,860
<i>What were they like?
How did they live?</i>

719
01:32:48,985 --> 01:32:52,739
<i>What did they feel about their world?</i>

720
01:32:52,739 --> 01:32:56,076
<i>What happened here?</i>

721
01:32:58,453 --> 01:33:02,957
<i>When the planet cooled,
they built devices like the tunnel-</i>

722
01:33:03,041 --> 01:33:09,214
<i>-able to retain air and sustain life
in an increasingly inhospitable place.</i>

723
01:33:09,297 --> 01:33:13,468
<i>But in the end, they didn't survive.</i>

724
01:33:13,593 --> 01:33:18,264
<i>Who knows why?
We won't be around to find out.</i>

725
01:33:18,390 --> 01:33:23,603
<i>I'm down to my last camera battery,
and filming as much as I can.</i>

726
01:33:23,687 --> 01:33:27,023
<i>This is for those of you
who are viewing this footage.</i>

727
01:33:27,148 --> 01:33:30,485
<i>Those who will seek answers
to these mysteries.</i>

728
01:33:30,568 --> 01:33:37,659
<i>Our only objective now is to survive.
As Herbert said: "We're stranded."</i>

729
01:33:37,784 --> 01:33:42,580
<i>Like castaways,
we'll hold out to the end.</i>

730
01:33:42,664 --> 01:33:46,418
<i>Take care of our families.</i>

731
