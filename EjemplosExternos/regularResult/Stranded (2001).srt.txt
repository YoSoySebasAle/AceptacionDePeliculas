it  days since the first manned
mission to mars left the space station
the space ship ares and her crew
of seven men and women
are now going into orbit
around the red planet
to make the journey with
the minimum energy requirement
after overcoming the earth
gravitational velocity
the ship entered an orbit around the
sun known as hohmann trajectory
the enigmatic red planet
is home to many mysteries
in  mars global surveyor failed
to detect a global gravitational field
but did find dozens of local fields
and strange gravitational anomalies
we have some comments from andre
vishniac captain of the mission
received just a few seconds ago
and broadcast to earth
this is a historic moment
captain
how do you feel at a time like this
youre flying over mars one of ancient
humanity dreams has come true
it was a difficult dream to achieve
this is our job
and weve been trained to do it
we cant worry about other factors
man landed on the moon
more than  years ago
the next and obvious step was mars
but it took longer than expected
why mars
what do you expect to find there
there is no easy answer to that
why does man explore at all
to learn and to know more
to prove that we can achieve goals
that seemed impossible to reach
susana are you ready
yes i am
herb
yeah im ready
ares
commander voice check
ares this is the pilot
voice check over
ares this is herbert
voice check over
start countdown
four three two one zero
ignition
it was like coming back from the
dead confusion and darkness reigned
do you read me belos
belos do you read me
someone answer do you read me
we hear you lowell weve crashed
is everyone okay
i dont know im okay
it pretty crazy here
the crash was awful
are you all right are you okay
get some rest dont worry
get some rest okay
were alive jesus
it amazing were alive we did it
come on johnson
we did it were alive
hey guys
is everybody okay down there
im all right
are you sure johnson
come on buddy we did it
vishniac are you okay
vishniac
vishniac answer me are you okay
vishniac
jenny
i dont know
his neck is broken
god bless his soul
if anyone finds this tape i want them
to record the facts as they occurred
the crash was terrible but the
belos cockpit miraculously survived
our captain andre vishniac
died on impact
they five survivors were soon forced
to confront the harsh reality
what lay ahead
wasnt going to be easy
i cant see anything
christ what a disaster
well never be able
to restore pressure in the hangar
and the rover a wreck
we discovered the failure for a few
seconds all systems were shut down
it was enough
to fool the flight computer
what caused it
youll have to look in your database
i wish there was something i could do
everyone looking for a way out
thanks lowell well talk later on
we need more room
this is too suffocating
sanchez youre second in command
with vishniac dead youre in charge
what do you suggest
all i wanted was to be somewhere
else a million miles away
first order from your new captain
you can all lie down and wait
wait wait for what
you dont want to know fidel
i refuse to accept that possibility
youd better get used to it herb
there a ship above our heads
and it cannot enter our atmosphere
there are no more landing modules
we expected that luca
theyll send a rescue mission
we only have to stay alive until then
rescue mission
do you hear what youre saying
it takes  months to send a ship
from earth how will they rescue us
if there one problem with orbit
itll delay that another year
i dont understand a rescue mission
the purpose would be to recover our
bodies well be dead within a year
that where youre wrong jenny
were going to survive
this descent module wasnt designed
to keep us alive for three years
were  million kilometers
from earth and were alone
there always a way to survive
any specific ideas
we must get to work all of us
our mission now is to survive
just as others have survived before
our situation is not as desperate
as it might seem at first glance
really not as desperate
i love this guy
i knew a geologist once
he went on a trip for one day to
switzerland and he saw a black cow
when he came back he wrote that all
the cows in switzerland were black
im a geologist that true
and that why i know
how to keep my feet on the ground
we are on mars herb were not
going to find palm trees out there
i dont know what we should do but
i know that we have to find answers
or die trying
what shall we do about water
mars atmosphere contains traces
of water it only a matter of time
sure we just have to get used to
not drinking much or breathing much
wont you consider the idea that we
may just have a chance of surviving
all right im listening
what your plan where do we start
precisely as were doing now
assessing our situation
well need a list of our resources
i can give you a general idea
go ahead
first of all we need two kilos
of oxygen per person per day
we need approximately two kilos of
water and about  kilos of solid food
with the supplies we have on board
for six people maybe one year
since the captain dead if were
very careful we can probably go
fifteen months that optimistic
please go on
all right
thanks to the recycling units we have
enough water for a couple of years
but if we use the recycler were
going to deplete our energy source
in about a year
the problem with oxygen is similar
in this situation wed be too miserable
to be worrying about breathing
were surrounded by oxygen the
planet is rusted that why it red
i got it but in this atmosphere
it in the form of carbon dioxide
we can separate the oxygen
using dry electrolysis
but wed use too much energy
the thermoelectric generators
would be depleted in a year
we could reduce heating wear our
thermal suits turn all the lights off
do you think we can last several years
inside our space suits in the dark
wed all go crazy
were no longer on a mission to mars
were shipwrecked
well have to accept a great deal
of suffering and discomfort
dont worry
im used to facing extreme situations
do i have to call you sir
no jenny you dont have to
but now im captain of this mission
or of the gang of castaways
i think we should
excuse me but it my turn now
luca i want a detailed inventory
of all our supplies
and your estimates as to how we can
make them last as long as possible
there another very important thing
we have to find out what happened
rodrigo you can take care of that
sure
johnson we need more room
the acceleration berths wont be
needed anymore take them apart
what about me
do you have anything for me to do
do you have any idea how to get the
resources we need from the surface
ill get working on that right away
we all set out
on our new mission survival
mars was the most inhospitable place
the human mind could ever imagine
we were determined to use every
available resource to survive
we all know that oxygen is the most
abundant element in the rocks of mars
is there any way to make use of it
i think so
well improvise a silicate reactor
to produce methane and steam
steam did you say steam
where are you going to get energy
we wouldnt use our generators
so how are you going to do it
with fuel from the belos engines
were not planning to take off and
can do what we want with the tanks
burning cryogenized fuel
that sounds very dangerous
luca did you hear herbert idea
yes i heard his idea
what do you think
it ridiculous
we dont know what condition the fuel
tanks are in no one checked
were having electrical problems
the system is not working at all
and were not getting
any feedback signals from the tanks
let suppose that theyre intact
if we suppose that theyre intact
which is a bit optimistic
we still have to improvise a silicon
reactor from the belos engines
it is not easy
and a lot of things could go wrong
we could focus
on more productive things
but im not the captain
so you make the decision
susana
i know where we are were way off
the designated landing point
were right here at the planet
equator near zero latitude
how can you be so sure
the cameras took several pictures
let me see them
unbelievable
it sure is look at this
it looks like permanent bank of fog
at the bottom of the valley
it just at the point nearest to us
maybe ares should take a look at it
it could be water vapor
could it be of use to us
i doubt it we need more than fog
do you know why we crashed
a software error
it lasted only a few seconds
but it misled the radio altimeter
bad luck i guess
luca and herbert
start getting ready for eva
take all of this outside and then
youll take a look at the engines
ill go with them while they get rid of
this junk ill dig a grave for andre
what the point of that let simply
put the captain body outside
if we lose touch with what we believe
in soon well be acting like animals
you mean with our superstitions
let focus on things that are practical
let not waste time
digging a useless grave
let gather our resources
and make some plans
okay luca nobody asked
you for help i can do it alone
we cant assume the responsibility
of taking the captain body outside
we could contaminate this planet
the human body is filled with bacteria
do you think bacteria would survive
to hell with bacteria
i dont want to die thinking about
if were going to leave bacteria behind
susana do i have permission to
bury the captain in a christian fashion
congratulations herbert
youre the first man on mars
baglioni right
it absurd to bury the captain
does anybody want to make
a memorable speech
why dont you do it luca
youre the brains of this mission
i think i will herbert
how does this sound
here lies andre vishniac
he was born on earth
and traveled a long way through
time and space to meet his destiny
right here
in this miserable and desolate place
ill say a few words
wilson wrote them before meeting his
death alongside scott in the antarctic
do you know what i think
i think herbert really is optimistic
but you are doing your part
assuming all the responsibility
im sure it must be very hard your
position is the most difficult of all
do you think im a pessimist
i think youre a strong woman
and you know what has to be done
im not strong i can assure you
you seem to be
ive spent all my life pretending
that a fair amount of practice
but right now im scared to death
dont tell the others
it will be our little secret
i wish i was as calm as you
although secrets must be hidden
until god reveals them to man
perhaps we are the ones he chose
to witness for the first time
the hidden heart
behind the barrier of ice
and the warmth of the sun under
the brilliant radiance of its rays
whilst the blizzard scorches and
freezes us with its biting embrace
id like to confess something susana
in my case im not so sure
there something that frightens me
as much as the idea of dying
losing my composure
allowing panic to take over
that not going to happen fidel
youll know how to react
as well as the rest of us
im not a strong man i can assure you
but i cant control my curiosity
that why i joined the mission
okay good
let go
were going to check the tanks
the first grave on mars
luca and herbert had done
a complete damage report
there was no need to ask
it was clear the news was not good
but herbert tried to bring us
some hope from the world outside
it ice weve got ice guys
it accumulated in the shade of belos
how can it be water
the martian atmosphere
is dry in absolute terms
but the cold is so intense that it
always on the verge of saturation
luca did you check
the engines and fuel tanks
they no longer exist they must
have been thrown off by the crash
it a miracle
they didnt blow up and kill us all
it wasnt a miracle but a curse
we are doomed to die
even though we keep on breathing
for a year we are as dead as andre
are you saying that there
no cryogenized fuel left
im saying that
the contents of this cabin
is all that we have left to survive
i dont think were going to make it
what going on here
give us a break okay
is anybody listening to what
im saying this is water
do you know what it means water
we didnt expect to have it
but here it is
the problem isnt water or air
our energy will run out within a year
and there no way
we can produce any more
we have to start
saving energy right now
our only chance is to reduce energy
consumption to a minimum
weve already lowered
the inside temperature
very well
well have to hope it works
any news on our rescue
no ill be leaving in two days
theyve called it an alternative
trajectory back to earth im sorry
do they have any idea back on earth
why we crashed
so far only theories some quite
intriguing ones but only theories
in what way
well
as you know mars has no
planetary magnetic fields
but it does have magnetic anomalies
and localized gravitations
there no satisfactory
explanation for this
weve detected the strongest anomaly
at the bottom of the marineris valley
it so strong that it could have
affected belos ocr oscillators
that not all there something
weird hidden under the fog
take a look at the new photos
and look at them carefully
im sorry i have to go i have
a long journey back good luck
lowell departure left the rest of us
with a deep feeling of solitude
all our hopes had vanished we were
victims of an unavoidable tragedy
what going on
has our useless neighbor given up yet
dont say that
it must have been frustrating for him
it breaking my heart
what that
a shot from a sar camera
im a doctor jim not an engineer
synthetic aperture radar
what that
ive seen this somewhere before
yeah so have i
it doesnt seem to be natural
it looks like a maze
ill compare it with the image bank
here it is this photo was taken
near the south pole of mars
look theyre completely identical
this is so weird
on our next trip to mars well take
some pictures and do investigations
unfortunately time is running out
for all of us
was that just another comment
or your conclusion as engineer
we need to call a meeting
the minimum amount of time for
a roundtrip between mars and earth
is two and a half years there
no way to cut down on this time
i know theyll never get here in time
to save us but they cant tell us that
how much time do we have if we
follow the energy saving measures
we have about
one year and two months
the problem is with the recycling
system it uses too much energy
what do you suggest
we have to accept the
baseline facts that all five of us
cannot survive on this module
for that period of time
luca what youre
sayingis terrible
you asked for the data
and these are the cold facts
the module cannot sustain the
five of us for two and a half years
how many can survive
how many
two of us
that not enough luca two out
of five doesnt make any sense
it ridiculous
it the way it is
no it not it not that way luca
that a way of giving up
youre the one who compared
our situation to castaways
sometimes castaways
have to make difficult decisions
are you crazy do you expect us to
draw lots to see who lives or dies
im not crazy in a year and a half
there will be five frozen bodies here
unless three of us stop using water
air and the recycling system
you and everyone else
refuse to accept that right herb
you think youll go back to earth like
some hero who never lost his cool
and always knew exactly what to do
he right we wont admit
the truth but he right
i dont plan to commit suicide
it against my religion
does anyone question luca numbers
no one
well then
then it clear that we all accept
that luca numbers are accurate
two of the five of us
they must be correct i dont know
i dont think we should
jump into anything
what im saying is that
we have to take time
to think before we make any
decision maybe well find something
what herbert
what are we going to find out there
when are you going to get that were
in the most unlivable place there is
the earth poles are a paradise
compared to where we are
how do we decide who lives or dies
how can we make a decision like that
why dont we apply
herbert example
what did castaways do
pull the shortest straw
should we decide that way
im the pilot of a space ship
that will never fly again
fidel youre the astrobiologist
your skills wouldnt be of any use
in this situation
herb skills do him no good either
but jenny is a doctor
and luca knows how to keep
this machine running
the decision has been made
luca and jenny stay
rodrigo herbert and i
well go outside for a walk
that a really euphemistic
way of putting it susana
very intelligent
youre very intelligent luca
perhaps the most intelligent of us all
did you have it all figured out when
you said that only two would survive
im sorry i just cant accept that
what cant you accept herb
we havent exhausted every possibility
if i must die i will but not before
having used up all our resources
that it herb there are none
did you hear what i said
there are no alternatives
there are
what are there herb
you seem to know everything
listen what is our main problem
energy so what
why dont we build a windmill
why didnt i think of that
that brilliant well build a windmill
that will get energy
and well fly back home the air is
too thin a windmill wont work
ive thought of everything
listen to me now
there are winds of more than
kilometers waiting for us out there
we can build it
the air is too thin
im a scientist ive thought of
everything there are no alternatives
im not going to waste energy and
resources on ideas that wont work
it will lower the chances
of anybody surviving
im sorry
that so easy for you to say
what does that mean
you dont understand that
youre so clever
and you dont understand that
im sorry
im not leaving the module
you cant ask me to do that
we decided to sleep for five hours
before preparing to leave
finally the moment arrived
what are those for
were taking as many oxygen tanks
as we can carry is that a problem
susan do you need that many tanks
please luca
all right ill go upstairs good luck
good luck take care
luca take care
you too
fidel
im sorry i arrived late
give me a hand with the suit
sure
my gloves
it looks just like
a sunny winter day on earth
certainly no one would say
that we are on another world
it a great day for a stroll i wish
we could take these heavy suits off
that wouldnt be wise herb
degrees below zero  rem per year
and virtually no atmospheric pressure
come on guys
susana i was thinking that you
should start up your video cameras
i can record everything from here
i think theyll be very satisfied on
earth with the images you can get
are you serious luca wont that use
up too much of the energy reserves
ive done some calculations
and i think we can afford it
i think itll be worth while
giving meaning to their last hours
it isnt that i think this is important
there could be some valuable shots
im not being sentimental
youre on screen susana
you can say a few words if you want
you already know our situation
it isnt worth while repeating it now
we are going to try to reach
the edge of the marineris valley
weve calculated that well have
to walk for about four or five hours
we are carrying
a few spare tanks of oxygen
so there is a pretty good chance
that well get some good shots
hope you enjoy them
wait a minute let stop here
i need to replace an oxygen tank
okay ill help you
how many more daylight hours
do we have
judging by the position of the sun
i guess about two maybe three
exactly four hours herb
how far are we
from the edge of the valley
youve already covered
three quarters of the distance
oh god
susana is everything okay
yeah
the landscape seemed to have been
carved out by catastrophic floods
millions of years ago that dry surface
could have been a deep chasm
the untamed beauty of mars its icy
indifference took our breath away
we were the first creatures to ever
set foot on that alien terrain
a mere anecdote
in the midst of that red desolation
have you ever seen such beauty
more than  kilometers long
and  wide
there nothing like it
in the entire solar system
look at those strata
i dont know if the video image will
record the subtle colors it beautiful
it quite clear susana
did they reach the valley yet
this place is beautiful
you might think that just getting here
has made it all worth while
look over there
yeah
we could try to make it to the fog
the ravine is eight kilometers deep
but the gravity on this planet
is a third of what it is on earth
it isnt as difficult as it seems
what do you think susana
let go down and take a look
all right why not
let go we dont have time to waste
is that a joke it just the fact that
im tired that keeps me from crying
oh god
let go
good idea
unfortunately it wont work
their air supply is too insufficient
to make it to the valley
are you nuts
ive turned off the microphone
dont worry
besides they already know
there no need to remind them
do you think our situation is better
we have a possibility of surviving
we have a possibility
if you listen to me
a few years ago
i dated a guy like you
he thought he was the smartest guy
in the world but he was a jerk
so youve had one boyfriend
fuck you luca fuck you
this is a form of madness
nothing more nothing less
all of us are crazy otherwise
we would have stayed on earth
what would make a sane man
leave his wife and children
and climb down a deep ravine
on the equator of a frozen planet
we must all be reasonably sane
or we wouldnt have passed the tests
i lied i wanted to come here
i was crazy enough to lie but
intelligent enough not to get caught
did you lie too
no i answered truthfully
hey guys
remember that all this is being taped
some day you will be on tvon earth
so careful what you say
they wouldnt do anything to harm the
image theyll portray us as heroes
with luck well all be on a pedestal
shut up luca
you are living proof
that psychological tests dont work
what about your team spirit
i guess i lied
as im sure everybody else did
except for herbert
i didnt lie luca i didnt need to
perhaps youre the only one who isnt
saying what an idiot i was
i wonder how theyll see us on tv
what thoughts will be running through
the minds of the people watching this
ive seen similar situations
youre sitting in your living room
drinking coffee after lunch
and suddenly they broadcast images
of just before a disaster
you see people who will be dead soon
and you wonder how they feel
what keeps them going
have you found out
no not at all
i feel like im seeing this on tv
i cant accept
that this is happening to me
my mind cant fathom that my air
supply will run out in a few hours
and that it will be
the end of the road
id like to suggest something how
about concentrating on the descent
as we talk were using up
more oxygen than necessary
the escarpment was what geologists
call a chaotic region
the path had been carved out
by a torrential flow of water
sometime in the martian past
wait a second
i need to replace a tank
ill help you
let stop here susana
okay
it your last bottle
calm down
youre using too much oxygen
yeah i know
are you all right
everything fine
herbert was on his last oxygen bottle
and we didnt have much more
we knew we were nearing the end
of the road but no one said a word
we simply concentrated
on taking one step at a time
look at that
what
phobos
it moving as fast as a satellite
it so beautiful
and demios is that brilliant star
right next to the edge
it doesnt look that spectacular
it doesnt matter rodrigo
they are the moons of barsoom
barsoom
shall we continue
barsoom
that was the name given to mars
by the inhabitants
of the empire of helium
ruled by the beautiful princess
dejah thoris
and where tars tarkas the warrior
with green skin and four arms fights
herbert explained this to us
as we continued our descent
and he told us
about the spired cities of helium
and the emerald green banks
of the great canal of nylosirtis
what are you talking about herb
john carter adventures on mars
my grandfather had all
edgar rice burroughs novels
the tarzan books
and those of john carter
but the carter ones
were my favorites
as a child i spent hours
devouring those marvelous novels
i dreamt of someday visiting the
kingdom of princess dejah thoris
and walking under
the two wild moons of barsoom
you two will have to go it alone
i think ill stay here for a while
what are you talking about
what the matter herb
i cant go on
my air supply has run out
i swear to you that id like to
but i cant
we knew that this moment
would come didnt we
susana didnt we
youre a good person
we should have gotten
to know each other better
the only happy people are those who
have made their dreams come true
it was all over
what were we doing
why were we continuing on down
stubbornly pointlessly
towards our own graves
herbert was back there
alone under the moons of barsoom
he was the best of us all
fidel
susana
can you hear me i cant get any
images im not seeing anything
im getting interference
it looks like the end of the road
we cant carry along here
oh shit
do we have to retrace
the whole route
not me
there was no way out
but suddenly i saw it
i realized immediately that there
was something strange in that cave
the slope we had followed
led straight to it
susana
luca jenny do you read me
i cant get
luca
fidel you have to see this
wait im coming
can you hear me
i cant get any images
im getting interference
shit
what does that mean
were dead
i dont know what the hell
what are you doing
we can stop conserving energy
we have a leak it not as airtight
as i thought were losing air
the pilot indicator
indicates that the
internal pressure has dropped
i dont understand why the sensors
didnt warn us before
maybe they broke in the crash
we can try to locate the leak
seal it and reestablish pressure
no my calculations were precise
and were based on an airtight cabin
i hadnt foreseen that we
would lose air because of a leak
that variable was not included
in my equation
the outcome couldnt be worse
even if we could plug the crack
we wouldnt have enough air
to wait for a rescue mission
i refuse to give up
ill find the damn leak and plug it
jenny
what
it useless the pressure going down
perhaps the crack is getting bigger
the leak will be visible from the
outside as a streak of water vapor
there no hope
believe me there no hope
i dont want to spend my last hours
in a pressurized suit
waiting for the air to disappear
listen jen please
i dont
what do you want to do tell me
we just admit
that were going to die
and just come together
come towards each other
we can make each other feel good
and it would be okay
i dont want to be alone
and just sit here waiting to die
why dont we just make each other
feel good we can be together
how much time
do we really have left
i think about twelve hours
any thoughts like this the whole
voyage have you just avoided
do you mean that with your enormous
talent and amazing intelligence
you cant find any other solution
than to die fucking
that completely unreasonable
that so uptight
listen jenny listen to me
ive thought about this a lot
i think we can adapt together
let me tell you what were going
to do my plan okay
ill get into my pressurized suit
and go outside to locate the leak
i dont care if it a waste of time at
least ill feel that im doing something
you can stay in here and masturbate
until you die of dehydration
when the rescue mission arrives
that how theyll find you
they may even erect a statue of you
on the same spot
it doesnt seem to be
a natural phenomenon
what do you mean
i dont understand how nature could
have created a cave like this
it kind of artificial like a tunnel
dug by an intelligent being
the walls are smooth almost perfect
there could be many explanations
an ancient frozen water course could
have perforated the rock this way
like an underground glacier
then the ice melted
it incredible fidel
can you see this amazing
there are symbols carved in the stone
it seems to be some kind of writing
they have angles as if they have been
carved by an intelligent being
oh my god
it manmade there no doubt
about it but i still cant believe it
oh my god
someone built it
someone it incredible
oh my god we cant complain
about it we have no right to
weve discovered the remains
of an ancient civilization
there are more symbols in the stone
susana im really seeing them
oh god it unbelievable
oh god
fidel had devoted his career to
proving the feasibility of life on mars
we had stumbled across evidence
he would have never dared dream of
but we wondered if that discovery
would die along with us
what do you think youre doing
i must find that leak
dont waste your time jen
weve lost too much air
must find the leak
we have to keep fighting
jen look at me
admit it were going to die
just admit it
leave me alone
i dont want to die
too bad we didnt bring
an archeologist with us
an archeologist would murder us
for not taking precautions
before coming in here and distorting
everything with our fingerprints
what do you mean
the ground is covered in dust
how long will our footprints last
a thousand years maybe
this tunnel goes down do you think
it will reach the bottom of the valley
it possible
but it  meters deep
i cant believe were here
what happening
the air pressure is higher here
your pressure gauge must be broken
no look there air and the
oxygen count is almost normal
we havent passed any airlock or
registered any pressure increase
your instruments must be off
my air pressure is almost zero
i dont have much to lose
decompression is a horrible way to die
im tired susana if this is the end
dont do it fidel
dont leave me alone
it cold and it has a metallic smell
but you can breathe it
without any problem
but that impossible
there air here
and sufficient pressure
dont ask me how it possible
it true
fidel
if there sufficient air here
yeah we could survive
we must find out what this place is
what it for
the pyramids must be recent
in comparison to this place
the stones around us have been here
longer than we can imagine
we may never know what it means
the symbols arent so strange con
sidering theyre from an alien culture
any race of hunters would have
developed the arrow symbol
the star and the cross sign
arent difficult to imagine either
the eye of the octopus
what
its structure is identical to that of
the human eye parallel evolution
well let go
wait we still have
no contact with belos
they cant help us back at the module
this place is a maze
i feel like an experimental rat
i wonder if it means anything
it must
imagine an ant that wanders into a
discarded coke bottle looking for food
it goes round and round until it drops
perhaps it thinks
that such a strange and
beautiful place must have a purpose
but these symbols
must have a meaning
fidel dont leave me
the corridor is a vacuum isnt it
yeah
how did they do it how can it be
please fidel dont leave me
susana im so very tired
fidel dont leave me please
im recording everything i can see
with my camera
but i cant transmit anything
youll only be able
to see these shots
if someone bothers
to look for my corpse
alone more alone than any other
human being had ever been
in a strange place where some
mysterious technology was operating
something was keeping the air inside
and perhaps it was that something
that caused the magnetic
and gravitational anomalies
perhaps the anomalies indicated
the position of mazes like this
scattered over the surface of mars
but i was lost inside
wandering alone through a place that
had already claimed my partner life
i had been going around in circles
for hours
and thought that rodrigo was right
that there was no logic behind it
perhaps it was just a rat trap or
who knows
the only thing i knew for sure was
that there was no air or pressure
in the corridors marked with a star
i do hope that these arrows
are taking me in the right direction
but nothing is certain
rodrigo is that you
two arms two legs
it all seems pretty human
but who knows
what it looked like originally
all i need is a small trace of vapor
to locate where the air is escaping
all i need is a small trace
this is impossible
jenny jenny
jenny
im here
yes that it it susan signal
is it possible
no it not possible
but that the signal
she cant be alive it impossible
jenny luca
can you copy
we copy but we dont have an image
you must try to make it over here
there air here for everyone
over here
and rodrigo
he didnt make it he dead
but yousurvive
breathable air here
i think she crazy
could she still be alive
if rodrigo gave her some oxygen
or if she took it from him
what are you trying to say
i dont know
maybe she hallucinating
we could try to reach her
could we
we have one hour of oxygen
on the ship
we have two space suits
with oxygen tanks filled
and we have the one
from the captain
i think we can make it
i thought you didnt want to die
in a space suit
ive come to the conclusion
that no death is good
i want to find out
what happened to susan
come on
i need to rest for a while these suits
were not designed for long walks
youre alive
vivo
jenny
it crazy
so this my friends
is the bottom of the marineris valley
it been tough getting down here
herb and fidel died
without even seeing it
but this place could mean hope for us
there water air and organic life
a primitive lichen species that we
may be able to extract proteins from
so there you have it it a fact
mars was inhabited millions of
years ago a civilization thrived here
what were they like
how did they live
what did they feel about their world
what happened here
when the planet cooled
they built devices like the tunnel
able to retain air and sustain life
in an increasingly inhospitable place
but in the end they didnt survive
who knows why
we wont be around to find out
im down to my last camera battery
and filming as much as i can
this is for those of you
who are viewing this footage
those who will seek answers
to these mysteries
our only objective now is to survive
as herbert said were stranded
like castaways
well hold out to the end
take care of our families
