1
00:00:13,163 --> 00:00:18,923
It's dinner. Hope you don't catch up, but I've already tasted.

2
00:00:20,684 --> 00:00:23,004
I look forward to showing you the rest.

3
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,700
-Hello. -Hello.

4
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,100
-Have you booked? -No. I might come another time.

5
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,820
No danger. Come in. Follow me up.

6
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:11,381
I feel very dizzy.

7
00:04:18,822 --> 00:04:21,782
I have exactly what you need.

8
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:28,783
-A stick? -Sugar. It makes the world sweeter.

9
00:04:30,063 --> 00:04:32,823
How much is left?

10
00:04:32,903 --> 00:04:35,463
You are actually done.

11
00:04:36,463 --> 00:04:38,503
-Already? -Yes.

12
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:43,504
And because you did so well, I would like to invite you for food.

13
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:47,384
If you have not eaten measured on that.

14
00:04:47,464 --> 00:04:49,704
I have a partner.

15
00:04:50,664 --> 00:04:53,705
Can't a man and woman go out and have dinner anymore?

16
00:04:55,145 --> 00:04:57,905
As long as it's just dinner.

17
00:05:00,065 --> 00:05:03,265
I told you not to take crème brûlée.

18
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:08,426
You've known me for five minutes and already say what to do.

19
00:05:08,506 --> 00:05:12,026
-I like that. -I have ordered a taxi.

20
00:05:12,106 --> 00:05:15,106
Hang with me. -It is too late.

21
00:05:15,186 --> 00:05:17,906
Is it?

22
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:21,667
Okay then.

23
00:05:41,628 --> 00:05:45,269
Come on! I could have gotten a taxi at this price.

24
00:05:53,109 --> 00:05:58,030
-Why did you seat the seats. -I want to keep everything hygienic.

25
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:17,471
First of all, thank you for helping me achieve 500 followers.

26
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:21,711
It's a small step for man, though.

27
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:26,592
We have something very special for you today

28
00:06:28,032 --> 00:06:33,032
or tomorrow, or next week. You get to see the core itself.

29
00:06:36,913 --> 00:06:40,833
You know me as the guy who opens game consoles, mobiles.

30
00:06:40,913 --> 00:06:43,313
Things you can buy for yourself

31
00:06:43,393 --> 00:06:46,033
and get the same tickle off as I do when I open the box.

32
00:06:46,113 --> 00:06:51,034
The only difference is that you do not have to buy anything.

33
00:06:56,194 --> 00:07:00,794
If you order something from an unknown source, you do so at your own risk.

34
00:07:10,355 --> 00:07:13,995
This is a mystery box

35
00:07:14,075 --> 00:07:17,596
from Darknet.

36
00:07:23,156 --> 00:07:29,077
It cost about 200 pounds and you get a black box like this.

37
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:33,157
The rest is a mystery.

38
00:07:46,998 --> 00:07:51,358
I know you're here to see "the old man in the box".

39
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:03,919
This speaks for itself.

40
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,640
We have some dolls here

41
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,080
as someone placed on hands, feet and head.

42
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,080
So ... yeah.

43
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:23,881
Here is a family photo.

44
00:08:25,801 --> 00:08:28,241
We have a family photo here.

45
00:08:28,321 --> 00:08:31,961
Someone has ripped their faces off.

46
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:37,682
The only thing I can read from this is that the person is a lunatic.

47
00:08:44,842 --> 00:08:47,323
A playing card.

48
00:08:54,723 --> 00:08:55,923
It was like a fan!

49
00:09:06,404 --> 00:09:10,244
I can't point out where things went wrong.

50
00:09:10,324 --> 00:09:13,605
One thing I realized is that

51
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:18,085
an addict never remembers why it really became as it became.

52
00:09:23,805 --> 00:09:26,806
Out of here, whore.

53
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:50,687
What do you think happens when they run out of items or people to sell?

54
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:54,368
It's just a matter of time.

55
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,611
-Nathan? -Yes, and you are?

56
00:10:33,691 --> 00:10:37,851
-Noah. - Noah ... Sit down.

57
00:10:45,372 --> 00:10:49,252
-How do you fix this? - Do like everyone else.

58
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:52,692
You spend your time and leave as fast as you can.

59
00:10:52,772 --> 00:10:56,252
-I mean the tattoos. -Ah, stupid of me.

60
00:10:56,332 --> 00:10:59,933
The equipment is made of different items from the dining room.

61
00:11:00,013 --> 00:11:03,813
I ask for extras pay.

62
00:11:03,893 --> 00:11:09,213
I made the syringe out of a pen and a metal spoon.

63
00:11:09,934 --> 00:11:12,614
It's hard currency in here.

64
00:11:12,694 --> 00:11:18,614
They are joined together with a motor from a shaver.

65
00:11:18,694 --> 00:11:23,295
I empty at least three pens a day for my ink collection.

66
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:26,895
I mix it with mouthwash to make it flow better.

67
00:11:26,975 --> 00:11:32,055
Then finally there are the needles and the batteries and then you come in.

68
00:11:32,135 --> 00:11:38,216
-I didn't know it was so hot. -I'm really handy.

69
00:11:41,656 --> 00:11:46,776
So ... now comes the fun. What do you want?

70
00:11:46,856 --> 00:11:50,937
-Noah's ark? -Are you a comedian too?

71
00:11:51,017 --> 00:11:56,137
-I work freely otherwise. - It's just running.

72
00:12:01,978 --> 00:12:05,938
-What are you for? -Oh ... A big question.

73
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:09,098
A big answer, then? No?

74
00:12:09,178 --> 00:12:12,218
Spray holes, tattoos.

75
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:17,499
No problem. Can I talk?

76
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:21,179
I'm worried that you're not in the shape to participate in this.

77
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:25,339
Then I would not sit here?

78
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:30,700
Nine girls have disappeared in the last nine months on a 25 km radius.

79
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,980
This young lady, Sophie Roberts ...

80
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,461
I have access to all her accounts and internet history.

81
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:44,581
It will put some momentum on you.

82
00:12:54,702 --> 00:12:57,542
This is skin.

83
00:12:58,702 --> 00:13:02,942
This is ... scarification.

84
00:13:05,182 --> 00:13:07,783
It is an old custom to label the body

85
00:13:07,863 --> 00:13:12,663
by cutting and grooving skin ...

86
00:13:12,743 --> 00:13:15,823
Pretty inside, actually.

87
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:19,663
A youngster reported a mysterious box from Darknet a few days ago.

88
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:23,384
He found it there and some other random things.

89
00:13:23,464 --> 00:13:27,624
I looked at some of these box openings. You should look at them.

90
00:13:27,704 --> 00:13:32,104
-What else do you have? -The other clues we have ...

91
00:13:32,184 --> 00:13:36,905
... are their families and friends who claim they planned to tattoo themselves.

92
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:42,225
We've been watching surveillance videos and bank statements.

93
00:13:42,305 --> 00:13:47,066
But to be honest, it has not yielded anything.

94
00:13:47,146 --> 00:13:49,986
The source of the skin, then?

95
00:13:51,026 --> 00:13:54,106
It's a needle in a haystack.

96
00:13:54,186 --> 00:13:58,106
The boxes are bought with bitcoin currency. That makes it impossible to track.

97
00:13:58,906 --> 00:14:03,347
And the sites where he advertised are mirrored around the world.

98
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:06,627
It also makes it impossible to track.

99
00:14:06,707 --> 00:14:10,027
We get to work on what we have.

100
00:14:10,107 --> 00:14:13,028
I'll start tonight.

101
00:14:15,748 --> 00:14:17,828
Rehab?

102
00:14:19,668 --> 00:14:22,348
Give me a few weeks.

103
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:45,950
If we continue to feel as if we are not accepted

104
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:52,511
our bodies, our minds and souls will collapse

105
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:57,471
in front of those who made us feel this way.

106
00:14:57,551 --> 00:15:00,911
There is a great opportunity for us out there.

107
00:15:00,991 --> 00:15:04,952
But the road to it is expensive.

108
00:15:05,032 --> 00:15:09,192
But we must try to succeed and live up to expectations.

109
00:15:29,193 --> 00:15:34,994
It is important to know that if your father's approval is not enough for you

110
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:40,874
you have no value to us here.

111
00:15:53,915 --> 00:15:57,036
Eve ... it's been three weeks.

112
00:15:57,116 --> 00:16:00,436
-How are you? -Not so bad.

113
00:16:00,516 --> 00:16:05,636
-How's the fall? -I'm working on it.

114
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:10,197
-Russian again? -You know me.

115
00:16:10,277 --> 00:16:15,357
People ask questions. The families are becoming more and more upset.

116
00:16:16,637 --> 00:16:19,477
I'm doing my best.

117
00:16:21,237 --> 00:16:25,398
- I'll call you back. -You don't hang up.

118
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,159
Hello everybody.

119
00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:41,599
My name is Eva.

120
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,760
My dad was a surgeon.

121
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:54,000
And ... like most dads ...

122
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,560
... especially those in medicine ...

123
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:06,561
... he felt a disgust for art.

124
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:13,641
I claimed that ...

125
00:17:13,721 --> 00:17:16,922
...my profession...

126
00:17:17,642 --> 00:17:21,322
... was artistically medical.

127
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:28,723
I help people transform themselves into something ... new.

128
00:17:28,803 --> 00:17:31,123
I like it.

129
00:17:40,604 --> 00:17:44,924
So ... take a look in the mirror.

130
00:17:49,404 --> 00:17:53,084
- What a strange feeling. -It's a scarification.

131
00:17:53,165 --> 00:17:57,165
-Why give people scars? - Their wish.

132
00:18:06,446 --> 00:18:09,406
60?

133
00:18:14,566 --> 00:18:17,686
-Thanks. -Thanks.

134
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,975
-I like your type of places.

135
00:20:07,055 --> 00:20:11,015
I don't go out that often, but I try to be a little adventurous.

136
00:20:11,095 --> 00:20:14,055
A drink? - Two shots, please.

137
00:20:15,575 --> 00:20:19,576
-Are you alone? -With a friend.

138
00:20:22,376 --> 00:20:25,056
Allow me.

139
00:20:27,376 --> 00:20:30,857
What a soft skin.

140
00:20:34,777 --> 00:20:37,697
Bowl!

141
00:20:44,898 --> 00:20:48,418
-What's your name? Lucy.

142
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,100
-Do you want a receipt? -Thanks.

143
00:21:24,261 --> 00:21:27,821
That's no danger, I said.

144
00:21:30,141 --> 00:21:35,502
Wait a minute ... I recognize you.

145
00:21:35,582 --> 00:21:37,302
Oh right.

146
00:21:39,622 --> 00:21:43,102
Don't you remember me?

147
00:21:43,182 --> 00:21:47,062
You don't seem so convincing.

148
00:21:47,142 --> 00:21:51,623
I see a lot of faces these days, but not many such scars.

149
00:21:51,703 --> 00:21:53,183
How does it heal?

150
00:21:53,263 --> 00:21:57,343
As good as a self-inflicted scar can heal.

151
00:21:58,103 --> 00:22:01,024
What a pleasure to hear.

152
00:22:01,104 --> 00:22:07,864
The world is small. Be sure to treat the wound, as I said ... and have fun.

153
00:22:07,944 --> 00:22:10,584
You, wait!

154
00:22:14,705 --> 00:22:18,825
You're the expert. Don't you want to show me around?

155
00:24:27,395 --> 00:24:31,555
-In one condition. -And what are the conditions?

156
00:24:31,635 --> 00:24:35,035
That I should not waste it on something stupid.

157
00:24:35,115 --> 00:24:38,356
So you bought a tattoo studio in response to:

158
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:41,956
"Don't spend it on something silly."

159
00:24:47,436 --> 00:24:51,117
Try telling these guys that some of this is silly.

160
00:24:52,317 --> 00:24:59,077
A friend said that ink in the skin makes a man crazy.

161
00:24:59,157 --> 00:25:01,637
Do you agree?

162
00:25:01,717 --> 00:25:08,358
If my personalities mean I'm crazy ... then I can stay that way.

163
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:11,718
What are you doing here?

164
00:25:13,398 --> 00:25:16,159
The same as you.

165
00:25:16,239 --> 00:25:19,159
I admire the art at its best.

166
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:27,519
I saw that you have no tattoos.

167
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,520
A tattooist without tattoos.

168
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,480
It confuses me.

169
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,480
Want to take something to eat?

170
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,521
I've eaten, but thanks for the offer.

171
00:25:44,441 --> 00:25:47,641
Something to drink, then?

172
00:25:47,721 --> 00:25:51,641
-I don't say no to that. -Good.

173
00:26:00,202 --> 00:26:04,722
-Where are you from? -Moscow. Nostrovia.

174
00:26:09,963 --> 00:26:12,803
-Why did you move here? - Look at something different.

175
00:26:12,883 --> 00:26:16,323
Different temperature too, huh?

176
00:26:16,403 --> 00:26:20,083
-Cold hands. - Warm heart.

177
00:26:21,604 --> 00:26:24,484
So why don't you have any tattoos?

178
00:26:24,564 --> 00:26:28,204
-Are you afraid of the pain? - I'm too greedy.

179
00:26:28,284 --> 00:26:34,205
-What do you mean? -I want my skin to be clean.

180
00:26:34,285 --> 00:26:37,405
If I started, I couldn't stop.

181
00:26:38,685 --> 00:26:44,165
When a customer asks me to do what I want, I become selfish.

182
00:26:44,245 --> 00:26:48,806
- Then I'll give them what I want. -Good answer.

183
00:26:50,846 --> 00:26:53,766
What does that mean...?

184
00:26:55,926 --> 00:27:00,207
That which reaches me, consumes me.

185
00:27:06,447 --> 00:27:11,087
You said you admire the art here.

186
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:13,928
You are a good listener.

187
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:16,848
But what are you doing in London?

188
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:23,568
I am a Russian spy with orders to poison the Prime Minister with Novichok.

189
00:27:24,888 --> 00:27:29,009
I hadn't expected that.

190
00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:32,649
I'm glad you appreciate my humor.

191
00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:37,809
Thanks for the chat.

192
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:40,530
You know where I am.

193
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:45,610
-Eva. -Nathanial. Kalla mig Nathan.

194
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:50,650
Nathan ... Nice to meet.

195
00:29:28,098 --> 00:29:31,338
Mia, Mia, Mia ...

196
00:29:33,658 --> 00:29:37,259
Someone should have called you a taxi home.

197
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,421
Now let's have some fun.

198
00:30:06,261 --> 00:30:08,901
What?

199
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:21,822
I thought you would say something.

200
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:52,144
Mia, Mia.

201
00:31:07,786 --> 00:31:12,386
You taste good.

202
00:32:25,272 --> 00:32:27,472
Hi, Terry.

203
00:32:44,313 --> 00:32:47,513
Hi, Sssssusan.

204
00:33:44,638 --> 00:33:47,158
Hi, Stanley.

205
00:33:47,238 --> 00:33:49,398
How are you?

206
00:33:53,878 --> 00:33:56,479
It's dinner.

207
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,839
Hope you don't catch up, but I have already tasted.

208
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:05,159
It is good.

209
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:08,519
You will like it.

210
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,080
But ... before you eat ...

211
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:18,680
... I want your advice.

212
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,761
What do you think about it?

213
00:34:30,681 --> 00:34:33,041
Good good.

214
00:34:36,482 --> 00:34:41,682
I'm glad you like it. I look forward to showing you the rest.

215
00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:20,370
-It became more difficult to feed my pet. -That is when you have reached the bottom.

216
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:26,330
-What's his name? -Stanley.

217
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:29,170
My nephew is Stanley. -He's great in the food.

218
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:33,131
He ended up with baby food when he was four. Animals in operation.

219
00:36:34,771 --> 00:36:42,171
- Did you let him starve? -Never. he was my responsibility.

220
00:36:42,251 --> 00:36:45,612
And I also have to eat.

221
00:36:58,933 --> 00:37:02,933
-How is it going? -It's fine.

222
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:08,813
Be quiet and no interruptions up there or here.

223
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:15,494
-You can continue as you please. - Don't worry, Nigel, I can handle it.

224
00:37:20,534 --> 00:37:23,414
Do you want?

225
00:37:28,815 --> 00:37:31,175
It's done.

226
00:37:32,975 --> 00:37:38,696
-Why is this design? -My girl was the same.

227
00:37:38,776 --> 00:37:41,296
She's gone.

228
00:37:43,456 --> 00:37:46,256
Sad to hear.

229
00:37:46,336 --> 00:37:49,777
I think you did the ... tattoo.

230
00:37:54,417 --> 00:37:57,617
Have you thought about trying something different?

231
00:37:57,697 --> 00:38:00,497
What do you mean?

232
00:38:00,577 --> 00:38:05,738
It's called scarification. It decorates the skin in a more surgical way.

233
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:10,778
Trust me.

234
00:38:14,658 --> 00:38:16,819
Do you have a taxi number?

235
00:38:16,899 --> 00:38:21,019
Do not worry. Give me two minutes and I'll drive you home later.

236
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:24,339
-Are you sure? -It is quiet.

237
00:38:43,141 --> 00:38:48,381
-Do you live far from here? -Not so far from here.

238
00:38:50,981 --> 00:38:55,942
-Why are the seats wrapped? - Aesthetic reasons.

239
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:04,982
Can you bring it to me?

240
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:15,103
What the hell?

241
00:39:54,146 --> 00:39:59,306
You can scream as loud as you can ... no one will hear you.

242
00:39:59,386 --> 00:40:01,747
You're screwed!

243
00:40:02,907 --> 00:40:07,227
I prefer distorted, but thanks for the compliment.

244
00:40:07,307 --> 00:40:12,988
-What are you gonna do to me? -Do not worry. You notice.

245
00:40:18,908 --> 00:40:25,869
You know in Hebrew, my name means: "He who gives".

246
00:40:25,949 --> 00:40:30,189
The ironic side of it: "He who takes".

247
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:47,350
-Your sick bastard! -You just wasted good meat.

248
00:41:00,751 --> 00:41:02,991
He who gives.

249
00:41:15,752 --> 00:41:21,313
-Hello Eva. It's been a while. -It really was.

250
00:41:21,393 --> 00:41:25,073
-I'm a busy guy. -And I'm a busy lady.

251
00:41:25,153 --> 00:41:28,473
But tonight I'm free ... if you are.

252
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:33,434
Aren't you free if I'm not?

253
00:41:33,514 --> 00:41:37,114
You are so fun.

254
00:41:37,194 --> 00:41:42,674
Can I come over to you? I cook and bring dinner.

255
00:41:42,754 --> 00:41:46,395
-I'm a vegetarian. -Noterat.

256
00:41:53,715 --> 00:41:58,316
Hi, the world, I'm the guy in the box and welcome to today's video.

257
00:41:58,396 --> 00:42:04,276
I want to begin by expressing my gratitude, sharing

258
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:06,396
and love I received since the last box opening.

259
00:42:06,476 --> 00:42:12,637
Thanks to you, I now have over 10,000 followers. Crazy.

260
00:42:12,717 --> 00:42:16,317
For those of you who missed my last broadcast you get the chance now.

261
00:42:16,397 --> 00:42:23,798
In the last video ... I got this leather wallet.

262
00:42:23,878 --> 00:42:28,118
Quite cruel, as you can see.

263
00:42:28,198 --> 00:42:31,318
It looks like a human tattoo.

264
00:42:31,398 --> 00:42:35,158
I'm sorry I haven't posted anything in awhile.

265
00:42:35,238 --> 00:42:39,599
Things like that fuck up a lot.

266
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:44,079
But I do it again today. Now let's go outside the box.

267
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:51,200
What you see is that this box is bigger than the previous one.

268
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,280
The cost was significantly higher as well.

269
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:59,360
But hope the content makes it worth it.

270
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,641
Now we check. Predictable...

271
00:43:03,921 --> 00:43:08,721
... and nervous, but as you can see ...

272
00:43:08,801 --> 00:43:12,841
... we have got more dolls.

273
00:43:20,322 --> 00:43:22,722
Dog food.

274
00:43:22,802 --> 00:43:27,322
Don't think I want to give it to the pussy, but it looks well sealed.

275
00:43:27,402 --> 00:43:32,283
Is it that I spend so much on boxes that I can't feed the cat.

276
00:43:35,683 --> 00:43:38,443
I have no words for this.

277
00:43:41,084 --> 00:43:45,484
This is strange. Very strange.

278
00:43:45,564 --> 00:43:48,564
We put it away.

279
00:43:49,524 --> 00:43:52,404
You know from last time

280
00:43:52,484 --> 00:43:55,685
that I can see everything after I open it.

281
00:43:55,765 --> 00:44:00,645
But this I have to open twice.

282
00:44:00,725 --> 00:44:03,885
We give it a try.

283
00:44:07,246 --> 00:44:09,806
It is very soft.

284
00:44:11,286 --> 00:44:14,086
It also smells.

285
00:44:32,487 --> 00:44:34,608
Hey ...

286
00:44:37,488 --> 00:44:40,328
Oh my God.

287
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:45,568
Hörni, I don't know if you can see it ...

288
00:44:55,769 --> 00:44:58,449
It's a heart.

289
00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:04,890
Should you

290
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:09,650
Oh, my God, no.

291
00:45:32,292 --> 00:45:35,172
It is a USB flash drive.

292
00:45:38,613 --> 00:45:41,013
What the hell.

293
00:45:42,413 --> 00:45:45,533
Then I try.

294
00:45:51,814 --> 00:45:54,934
There is only one file.

295
00:45:55,014 --> 00:45:58,654
It is called "Cornucopia".

296
00:46:10,775 --> 00:46:14,775
Hörni, I'm sorry, but we have to let it go.

297
00:46:36,937 --> 00:46:39,657
Specialbud.

298
00:46:43,658 --> 00:46:47,978
- Nice place. -I rent it.

299
00:46:48,058 --> 00:46:51,218
-Do you drink red? -Yes thank you.

300
00:47:05,619 --> 00:47:07,699
The blind leads the blind.

301
00:47:07,779 --> 00:47:10,220
Today's lecture is a demonstration

302
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:13,140
of a classic proverb.

303
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:16,780
The blind leads the blind.

304
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:24,261
If you change it to the deaf, the blind shows say it is complicated.

305
00:47:25,141 --> 00:47:31,101
Just like now. Only half of you can see me.

306
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:37,022
Don't you think that if the Father had the ability to see us?

307
00:47:37,102 --> 00:47:41,342
and see all the actions we perform

308
00:47:41,422 --> 00:47:48,063
our punishment would lead us to a more perfect place.

309
00:47:49,743 --> 00:47:54,183
I'll leave you with that thought.

310
00:47:54,263 --> 00:47:56,863
Remember to...

311
00:47:56,943 --> 00:48:00,663
... communication is vital to the issue

312
00:48:00,743 --> 00:48:07,464
and will make you realize how important communication is in your future choices.

313
00:48:09,504 --> 00:48:16,025
When you return home you will not disappoint yourself.

314
00:48:16,945 --> 00:48:23,185
When the Father returns to this land, we shall not disappoint him.

315
00:48:24,385 --> 00:48:26,905
We will meet Him.

316
00:48:31,706 --> 00:48:37,226
Can you send the cross stitch kit to your friend with blindfold.

317
00:48:40,827 --> 00:48:48,067
The deaf person opposite can only see the pattern you are going to sew.

318
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:54,148
The blind can only sew on the instructions given to them.

319
00:48:55,868 --> 00:48:58,268
Something to start.

320
00:49:11,829 --> 00:49:16,269
How does it taste?

321
00:49:16,349 --> 00:49:22,310
-It means perfect in Russian. -I should have guessed.

322
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:29,550
That which reaches me, consumes me.

323
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:34,111
-Excuse me? -Tatueringen.

324
00:49:38,191 --> 00:49:44,751
Why should one come close to something so innocent.

325
00:49:44,831 --> 00:49:49,952
Not only do I destroy a life without a voice, but ...

326
00:49:50,032 --> 00:49:53,472
... myself too.

327
00:49:53,552 --> 00:49:57,312
Close, but also devour.

328
00:49:59,873 --> 00:50:03,353
-How long? - I've never eaten meat.

329
00:50:03,433 --> 00:50:07,633
- Have you never thought about it? -Not directly.

330
00:50:08,553 --> 00:50:13,554
-Can I persuade you to try? -No, that's fine, thank you.

331
00:50:13,634 --> 00:50:17,554
-You can smell anyway? -I feel the smell from here.

332
00:50:17,634 --> 00:50:21,354
-Take a scent of aroma. -I said no!

333
00:50:29,315 --> 00:50:34,155
-I apologize. -No, leave it.

334
00:50:34,235 --> 00:50:38,916
I go up and change.

335
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:06,518
- It was not necessary ... - It was my mother's.

336
00:51:06,598 --> 00:51:08,158
-Hello! -Follow me.

337
00:51:08,238 --> 00:51:11,078
Why are the seats wrapped?

338
00:51:12,078 --> 00:51:18,279
It sounds weird. I have donated most, but this one was my favorite.

339
00:51:20,279 --> 00:51:23,759
Don't you think your mother had had something against it?

340
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:27,079
Not at all.

341
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:32,960
This is very strange.

342
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,680
But ... okay, then.

343
00:51:50,961 --> 00:51:54,041
I want this.

344
00:51:54,121 --> 00:51:56,722
You can get it.

345
00:53:20,008 --> 00:53:24,248
What the hell are you doing here? How did you get in?

346
00:53:24,328 --> 00:53:28,209
You left the key in the door.

347
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:30,329
Well ...

348
00:53:32,049 --> 00:53:34,929
Good timing.

349
00:54:55,855 --> 00:54:58,176
IVANOV EVA UK CITIZENS

350
00:54:58,256 --> 00:55:00,936
COHEN DRAWING British Citizens

351
00:58:42,953 --> 00:58:47,313
-Reach? -We have a mountain to climb.

352
00:58:47,393 --> 00:58:50,553
Tell me about Nathan.

353
00:58:51,994 --> 00:58:57,794
Yes, he is making a distinction. Yes, he is a tattoo artist.

354
00:58:57,874 --> 00:59:02,794
He also happens to be very odd.

355
00:59:02,874 --> 00:59:06,315
But it doesn't click anywhere.

356
00:59:06,395 --> 00:59:09,395
-Click with you? -Excuse?

357
00:59:09,475 --> 00:59:13,795
-Your methods are effective, but dangerous. -Look at the results.

358
00:59:13,875 --> 00:59:19,516
In the end, you have to give me more to work with. You can't do it yourself.

359
00:59:19,596 --> 00:59:22,956
When I have something to give, you can have it.

360
00:59:24,116 --> 00:59:27,196
I have understood.

361
00:59:35,477 --> 00:59:37,317
-Hello. - Sorry, we're fully booked.

362
00:59:37,397 --> 00:59:41,877
I'm friends with Nathan. Can I wed him?

363
00:59:41,957 --> 00:59:46,518
-Oh, Nathan resigned this morning. -I do not understand.

364
00:59:46,598 --> 00:59:51,918
He came here before me.

365
00:59:51,998 --> 00:59:57,479
But is that his studio? He bought it from her mother's legacy.

366
00:59:58,719 --> 01:00:01,599
No, it's my studio.

367
01:00:02,479 --> 01:00:07,839
- But ... he said it. - He was probably just trying to impress.

368
01:00:07,919 --> 01:00:10,560
Nathan was just an apprentice.

369
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:17,040
No, I quit.

370
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:23,281
- They didn't know anything ... and you just quit. - It wasn't the right place for me anymore.

371
01:00:26,161 --> 01:00:30,201
-Don't you enjoy the pain? -I did it before, not now.

372
01:00:30,281 --> 01:00:35,482
-Don't you tattoo yourself? -Not directly.

373
01:00:35,562 --> 01:00:40,322
-Do you know where he is now? -No clue.

374
01:00:45,162 --> 01:00:48,202
Okay thanks.

375
01:01:38,806 --> 01:01:40,967
Nathan?

376
01:01:49,047 --> 01:01:51,087
Nathan?

377
01:04:10,178 --> 01:04:12,578
- There is no distribution. -Do you blame me?

378
01:04:12,658 --> 01:04:15,418
-We need more people. - More help?

379
01:04:15,498 --> 01:04:18,299
No, to review and fill the drawers.

380
01:04:18,379 --> 01:04:21,899
We use the weak to feed ...

381
01:04:21,979 --> 01:04:25,459
Stick with you, whore.

382
01:04:47,221 --> 01:04:50,501
What does it mean?

383
01:04:52,061 --> 01:04:56,262
What gives birth to me kills me.

384
01:05:24,064 --> 01:05:28,424
-Eva, how are you? -You were right.

385
01:05:28,504 --> 01:05:32,824
-About what? - I'll tell you when we see you.

386
01:05:32,904 --> 01:05:36,225
No, you have to tell me now.

387
01:05:36,305 --> 01:05:37,945
Eva?

388
01:05:55,946 --> 01:06:00,266
Hello everybody.

389
01:06:00,346 --> 01:06:03,987
Be good pipes towards the end.

390
01:06:04,067 --> 01:06:07,387
And Merry Christmas to you all.

391
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:24,447
Nathan?

392
01:10:24,527 --> 01:10:27,487
The game is over.

393
01:10:30,967 --> 01:10:35,208
You found the keys.

394
01:10:37,928 --> 01:10:40,568
It's time to leave now.

395
01:10:41,488 --> 01:10:44,808
Stop faking the accent. What do you think?

396
01:10:46,368 --> 01:10:49,969
Have you taken the girls?

397
01:10:50,049 --> 01:10:52,209
Here we go.

398
01:10:52,289 --> 01:10:53,769
Tell them where they are

399
01:10:53,849 --> 01:10:57,689
then you will not sit as deep down in the crap as you do now.

400
01:10:57,769 --> 01:11:00,970
Now I'll tell you.

401
01:11:01,050 --> 01:11:04,130
I tattooed the girls.

402
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:08,410
I made them feel good.

403
01:11:08,490 --> 01:11:12,731
And then ... when I finished ...

404
01:11:13,771 --> 01:11:18,291
... I cut off their skin ...

405
01:11:18,371 --> 01:11:21,571
... and then I ate them.

406
01:11:25,051 --> 01:11:28,052
What I can't handle ...

407
01:11:30,852 --> 01:11:34,852
... I share with this gang.

408
01:11:34,932 --> 01:11:38,652
How do you stand up for yourself?

409
01:11:46,613 --> 01:11:49,773
Someone is hungry.

410
01:12:24,216 --> 01:12:26,176
Eva?

411
01:12:36,737 --> 01:12:38,857
Eva!

412
01:13:54,903 --> 01:13:58,263
We had been a couple to count on.

413
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:05,304
Against all odds.

414
01:14:09,464 --> 01:14:12,904
I wonder it would have been different now.

415
01:14:13,704 --> 01:14:16,345
But it can't be.

416
01:17:04,598 --> 01:17:07,718
Sophie?

417
01:17:08,558 --> 01:17:11,918
-Who are you? The police. I'll get you out.

418
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,521
She doesn't wake up.

419
01:17:53,041 --> 01:17:55,881
Why are you doing this?

420
01:17:57,882 --> 01:18:02,442
I was about to finish it before I met you.

421
01:18:03,922 --> 01:18:08,322
Complete what?

422
01:18:08,402 --> 01:18:11,363
I haven't been much to sports.

423
01:18:12,203 --> 01:18:15,123
Didn't understand me on that.

424
01:18:18,963 --> 01:18:22,684
But now I'm the bat

425
01:18:24,524 --> 01:18:27,924
and you are the ball.

426
01:18:33,604 --> 01:18:36,845
It sounds much more enticing.

427
01:18:36,925 --> 01:18:40,805
-You disgust me. -Now.

428
01:18:43,845 --> 01:18:46,605
Now now!

429
01:18:55,686 --> 01:18:59,326
You and I...

430
01:18:59,406 --> 01:19:03,647
... has covered all the bases.

431
01:19:06,607 --> 01:19:10,887
Now it's time to make a home run.

432
01:19:21,168 --> 01:19:24,608
The thing with my job is ...

433
01:19:29,529 --> 01:19:32,089
I give...

434
01:19:40,970 --> 01:19:43,370
... and I take.

435
01:20:55,655 --> 01:21:00,776
- Hi, Nathanial? -Yes. Can I help you?

436
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:05,056
District Prosecutor, Janice Jordan. Can I come in?

437
01:21:23,777 --> 01:21:30,018
- May I ask why you are here? -We have several cases of missing persons.

438
01:21:30,098 --> 01:21:35,258
We usually search through these areas before we start asking questions.

439
01:21:44,179 --> 01:21:46,819
What do you think?

440
01:21:46,899 --> 01:21:49,579
About what? Instead?

441
01:21:49,659 --> 01:21:53,460
-It was probably fun in the 90s. - I remember.

442
01:21:53,540 --> 01:21:57,660
- Are you sleeping here? -It's better than in a store.

443
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:04,861
It has been locked for years. I never got any key.

444
01:22:16,542 --> 01:22:19,942
Public toilets. You are welcome.

445
01:22:38,423 --> 01:22:41,903
I want to keep it simple.

446
01:22:49,544 --> 01:22:54,624
I am very busy and now I have been accommodating enough.

447
01:22:54,704 --> 01:22:57,745
I'm looking for Eva.

448
01:22:57,825 --> 01:23:00,225
What do you mean?

449
01:23:04,905 --> 01:23:07,665
It's time for you to go.

450
01:23:07,745 --> 01:23:13,066
-I can get a search warrant. -Do it.

451
01:23:17,746 --> 01:23:22,147
Good luck with the renovation. I look forward to seeing it.

452
01:25:13,795 --> 01:25:16,195
Eva?

453
01:25:24,956 --> 01:25:28,436
Do you know why my name is Eva?

454
01:25:28,516 --> 01:25:32,037
It means "to live".

455
01:25:32,117 --> 01:25:35,037
To live a life.

456
01:25:38,557 --> 01:25:42,077
My gift to you is dead.

457
01:25:58,519 --> 01:26:01,439
Do you know what you did to her?

458
01:26:06,399 --> 01:26:08,799
That's life.

459
01:26:08,879 --> 01:26:11,880
We live and we die.

460
01:26:30,281 --> 01:26:34,441
Calm down. You are going nowhere.

461
01:26:34,521 --> 01:26:37,562
I ...

462
01:26:37,642 --> 01:26:39,962
...need you.

463
01:26:54,643 --> 01:26:58,363
I have something very special for you today.

464
01:26:58,443 --> 01:27:02,244
Do you know why? 1,000,000 followers.

465
01:27:02,324 --> 01:27:07,764
This is a new mystery box. It cost £ 2,000.

466
01:27:07,844 --> 01:27:12,764
I've already opened it, but I have to share it with you.

467
01:27:12,844 --> 01:27:17,005
It looks like a piece of clothing. As you see...

468
01:27:17,085 --> 01:27:20,245
... it has many details.

469
01:27:20,325 --> 01:27:25,845
The problem is that it feels like human skin.

470
01:27:26,605 --> 01:27:29,566
But it's probably pig skin.

471
01:27:32,606 --> 01:27:35,806
Then you were ready.

472
01:27:37,206 --> 01:27:40,486
Thanks friend.

473
01:27:40,566 --> 01:27:43,767
I did not get hold of batteries.

474
01:27:45,767 --> 01:27:48,807
These are not good for health.

475
01:27:48,887 --> 01:27:51,927
As you wish.

476
01:27:52,007 --> 01:27:54,728
-It does not matter. I'm going out today. -It's not true?

477
01:27:54,808 --> 01:27:59,128
-Yes, you're my last customer. -So you're released earlier?

478
01:27:59,208 --> 01:28:02,128
Four years. Death by careless driving.

479
01:28:58,692 --> 01:29:01,853
Eva?

480
01:30:28,419 --> 01:30:30,740
Hello!

481
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:35,140
Hello!

482
01:31:13,943 --> 01:31:19,823
I was stuck there for 15 hours.

483
01:31:19,903 --> 01:31:23,544
Come on! When is the trial?

484
01:31:23,624 --> 01:31:25,864
There will be no trial.

485
01:31:25,944 --> 01:31:29,664
Yes, but everything is there.

486
01:31:29,744 --> 01:31:34,224
- The forensics found nothing. - But he will be sentenced?

487
01:31:34,304 --> 01:31:40,585
- Four years for causing another's death. -He's a very smart man.

488
01:31:40,665 --> 01:31:44,265
And I'm a patient woman.

489
01:31:46,425 --> 01:31:49,906
The only blood they found was mine.

490
01:31:49,986 --> 01:31:54,386
Don't forget that crowbars get a rod.

491
01:31:54,466 --> 01:31:57,746
I saw what you were doing.

492
01:31:58,666 --> 01:32:01,226
Take it easy.

493
01:32:11,147 --> 01:32:16,188
-It was a long time ago. -I had a full up. Good to see you.

494
01:32:44,390 --> 01:32:47,870
Good work.

495
01:32:47,950 --> 01:32:51,790
We are family. But this ...

496
01:32:51,870 --> 01:32:54,391
... it is entirely you.

497
01:33:02,351 --> 01:33:06,752
Thank you for coming to this ceremonial event.

498
01:33:06,832 --> 01:33:10,072
Please stand up.

499
01:33:12,312 --> 01:33:17,432
What you all succeeded in has helped us get to the next step ...

500
01:33:20,873 --> 01:33:25,393
... to make the world a better place ...

501
01:33:25,473 --> 01:33:30,033
... for our children, ourselves ...

502
01:33:30,113 --> 01:33:32,514
... and the Father.

503
01:33:33,674 --> 01:33:40,274
The rulers have confirmed that the Father is with us in the end.

504
01:33:41,594 --> 01:33:46,635
That which reaches me, consumes me.

505
01:33:46,715 --> 01:33:50,115
That which reaches me, consumes me.

506
01:33:50,195 --> 01:33:53,595
That which reaches me, consumes me.

507
01:33:53,675 --> 01:33:56,835
That which reaches me, consumes me.

508
01:33:56,915 --> 01:34:00,596
That which reaches me, consumes me.

509
01:34:00,676 --> 01:34:03,876
That which reaches me, consumes me.

510
01:34:03,956 --> 01:34:07,036
That which reaches me, consumes me.

511
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:11,717
That which reaches me, consumes me.

512
01:34:11,797 --> 01:34:15,397
That which reaches me, consumes me.

513
01:34:16,717 --> 01:34:19,717
That which reaches me, consumes me.
