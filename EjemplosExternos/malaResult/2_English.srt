i didnt know
she was one yet
according to phifer
oh great
here we go again
dont let what
she said throw you
this is a totally
different situation
than genaro
how so
didnt we assume
she was guilty also
that what we do
it wasnt your fault
you didnt kill her
oh
there a briefing
before de luca warms
her over at
phifer
all right
let get started
okay
luke carter
son of armenian
immigrants
born in chicago
first arrest age
tried as an adult
for murder
beat the rap
moved to miami
in
to start a beach
hot dog cart
franchise
is that the one
with the babes in
the bikini floss
yeah
sold the business
five years later
for upward of
five million bucks
that a lot
of hot dogs
and buns
yeah baby
laughs
after that
came to baltimore
and invested in
a garbage company
with his partner
moe the mongoose
fritkin
mongoose
i love these
mob monikers
were looking into him
as a possible suspect
though his alibi
seems solid
i want to hear
about the wife
yes
angela may carter
born here in baltimore
father lou a welder
mother mia housewife
has a degree
in psychology
married once before
to roy frankman
restaurateur
the enclave
huh i remember it
good food
died on a fishing trip
near hope island
fell overboard at night
dead drunk
she was on the boat
really
but so were five others
ruled an accident
any insurance
a million dollar policy
but the irs took it
all for back taxes
she filed bankruptcy
anyway she met carter
a year later
and they got married
after a month
what the estate worth
six million i guess
house on the hill
condo in palm beach
cabin in tahoe
owned a motorcycle dealership
on the west side
vehicles
a lamborghini
a mercedes
a couple of bikes
he liked his toys
sure did
collected shotguns too
the financials
include
minor stocks
in mutual funds
low yield bonds
no retirement plan
and
no life insurance
that hurts
what else
we found footprints
in the underpass
behind the yard
not a shoe
in the house matches
forensics
ballistic analysis
points to a shotgun
loaded with
subought shells
he was shot in the face
at extremely close range
execution style
then she should have
had some blood on her
yeah except that she
jumped in the water
and pulled him out
what about the naa
to see if she
discharged a weapon
negative find again
it could have been
wiped by the water
but
check this out
trace metal tests
not easily wiped away
it can stick with you
at least a week
the blue light shows traces on her hands
consistent with
the composition
of a shotgun
bingo
anything on the alibi
catherine bicksahmed
born in tampa
she married
to sheik mafir ahmed
she a fashion
photographer
suspect says she was
with her until
anyone talk to her
we havent
found her yet
come on guys
give me something solid
how about
a prenup agreement
lexis search
turned this up
if they divorce
she gets nothing
but if he dies
she gets it all
oldest crime
in the books
maybe
what
i agree that
she a suspect
but we cant rule out
the possibility of a mob hit
nobody said
this was mob related
we couldnt get him
on a rico
let not even go there
let stick with what we got
chattering
man hey boss
al whatcha got
just in a jogger
running by the house
on the night
of the murder
about
thinks he saw
a car outside
thinks it was blue
and thinks the plate
started with a q
or an o
well
i think we can
do better than that
youre my best
investigator
sniff something out
i would
except this case stinks
it not the case that stinks
it the garbage
man how many times is she going to have to tell you
she found him
dead there
and the shotgun
she doesnt know about that
her alibi
for the tenth time
lieutenant
catherine bicksahmed
but she doesnt know
where she is
so what the hell
does she know
that was uncalled for
nice going carmine
do you have any idea what
a voluntary interview means
she hasnt
volunteered anything
she doesnt know
okay answer me this
mrs carter
you said you left
the promenade
in rosedale
at  sharp
yes
your call to
came in at
what your point
you give her
five minutes
to park
walk in
find your husband
panic sob
and grieve
that only leaves
minutes to
cross town
you cant expect me
to believe anybody
can cross town
in  minutes
i drive fast
and im
a buddhist monk
where your shotgun
i told you
i dont know anything
about a shotgun
she hiding something
the mayor cousin
has been murdered
and i have to
make a statement
how about
garbage man loses head
if found
please recycle
that not funny lewis
the guy was connected
to organized crime
he was a hood
in quotidian english
so was robin of sherwood
but not to the press
spoken like a true
pragmatic prevaricator
book her
excuse me
lieutenant
let me make something
perfectly clear
until i have
further proof
our position on
this case is that
is it not mob related
oh okay
and this is not
an election year
if you spent
a little more time
using your rico connections
to gather evidence
this wouldnt be
a concern would it
angela carter
you are under arrest
for the murder
of luke carter
what the hell is this
this is unacceptable
she came here
on a voluntary basis
you have the right
to remain silent
were rushing into this
why do you say that
look at the scenario
execution style
shot to the head
men shoe prints
in the tunnel
no murder weapon
no witnesses
no tapes
this could be
a professional hit
for all we know
she tested positive
for trace metals
a positive reading
you can get
from touching
the bumper of a car
she got no alibi
and she got motive
i think we have enough
jonas
i agree
but it imperative
that we confute
what we do have
to our advantage
and well confirm that
as soon as possible sir
lewis
missy will be in charge
of the bail proceedings
well
congratulations
my client pleads
not guilty your honor
plea entered
bail motions
the people request
bail be denied
due to the nature
of the crime
objection your honor
the nature of this crime
is being concocted
by the people
besides my client
presents no flight risk
and she has no prior
criminal record
bail will be set
at
what
that excessive
my client financial
situation
counselor
the expedited trial date
will be set
two weeks from today
does that suit everyone
sure
that should
please phifer
the answers that
youre looking for
are a lot closer
than you think
watch yourself
that was
highly improper
excuse me
you communicated
with my client
bullshit
ill have the court
take note of that
you saw it
she talked to me
oh counselor
i see youre getting personal
with the accused again
want an exclusive clive
an exclusive
yeah
but i thought
you still harbored
illwill towards me
no child molesters
toxic waste
and vermin
those i harbor
illwill against
anything lower
i dont think about
now listen to me
you sewer rat
you let go of me
here the exclusive
this is not about genaro
or me or about any cover up
you did enough
damage with your
vicious little story
so this time
the case is clean
and therell be
no digging
or personal files
to be bought
understood
listen lewis
im a journalist
people cover up
i expose
what did you expect
yeah sure
well im not giving you
anything to talk about
this time
have a nice day
de luca any objection to the taping
lawyer yes
angela no
de luca okay let begin
first
may i make a statement
i am innocent if you come after me
youll be prosecuting an innocent woman
youll be convicting
an innocent woman
youll be killing
an innocent woman
can you live with that
clive
for three weeks now
the city has been paralyzed
with a crippling
garbage strike
experts say that
the lack of resolution
is directly attributable
to the murder
of trash king
luke carter
ever since his estate
and belongings were frozen
all contract talks
have stalled
and politicians
city and statewide
are at odds
over what to do about
this explosive impasse
phifer
i understand yes
no no
that was not our intention
we are
thank you
well
ive just been
masticated
by the matriarch
of our fair city
she rather perturbed
with clive johnson
broadcast concerning
our case
shed like to know
where the leak came from
well dont look at me
i cant stand the worm
besides how does she know
it an internal leak
for christ sake
the broadcast mentioned
a missing video tape
a shotgun and the blood
stained trash contract
and she being
released on bail
this afternoon
what how
i have no idea
i just got the heads up
from county  minutes ago
cant we do anything
right around here
and what this about
you talking to her
i didnt
telephone rings
secretary on intercom
sir it the mayor again
lewis find out
how she made bail
yes your honor
we were just talking
about your circean charms
yes were on the leak
i understand youre under
the gun on the strike yes
i appreciate that
you went out on a limb
to endorse my candidacy
man client privilege counselor
ben ill tell you
what were gonna do
you remember
the rico case
we still got
a loose end
carter consolidated
financials
found copies
right in his basement
you have terrible
handwriting
that case is closed
perjury and fraud
are still options
itll never stick
doesnt matter
youll still eat it
maybe lose your license
deep sigh
tell me what the hell
you need
was the estate bankrupt
are you da pricks
so how did she
make bail then
i dont know
she borrowed the money
from somewhere else
what happened to all
all of carter cash
luke he was being
ousted by his partner
so he tried to come up
with the money
for the city bid
on his own
and
he borrowed from
the wrong people
meaning
he borrowed from
the wrong fucking people
oh shit
took your eye
off the ball dom
you my fucking pro now
not even jack nicklaus
could cure that slice
go on ahead
ill catch up at the next tee
so why are you
disturbing me
in my place
of leisure
we could go down
to the th street
precinct coffee shop
they got some really
strong java down there
sighs
so what this
all about
luke carter
yeah i heard
fucking tragic
is it
word is he had to
borrow from you
to secure
the trash contract
and couldnt
pay you back
counselor
our business today
is more corporate
we collect debts
on foreclosures
seizures and takeovers
not murder
that behavior
is for the animals
in jersey
ah
domenico the humanist
vittorio now eh
you fucking guys
you think
you know everything
sure luke and me
was in business
but he was my friend
for  years
anyone not so friendly
i could find out
for you
you do that
hey
you want my take
yeah dom please
spare no detail
last week me and luke
corner table
golden beaver club
bottle of chivas
black snatch
dancing her silicone
titties in our face
he told me he was gonna
divorce his wife bitch ass
detailed enough for you
he say why
he thought she was
gonna have him greased
what
he found out about
an insurance policy
that shed taken out
in his name last year
thanks dom
videotape playing
then you called the police
yes
and then you pulled him out
yes
tell me this mrs carter
if you called the police first
then why was there pool water on the floor
maybe the sequence
is wrong
maybe i um
pulled him out
do you mean after
you shot him
lawyer objection come on
youre deliberately leading her
trying to extort an admission from her
i didnt do it
i didnt
what going on
she agreed
to a polygraph
and psychological
evaluation
and sheck is allowing this
oh she insisted
why
missy
she said
you could tell us
well
i have no idea
are you sure
yes im sure
whatever
it bodes gregarious
for our side
if not all together
egregious
yeah
sheck
hm counselor
the way this works
is threephased
first
a direct no format
interrogation
anything goes
then everyone leaves
and we do a separate
standardized
polygraph test
when that over
ill administer
a psychological probe
to get a profile
on mrs carter
and the reason
for this
additional procedure
is what dr farmer
it a new trend in
polygraph profile testing
uses normalization of sine
and cotangent curves
which helps give
appropriate weight
to subjectivity
and psychological
demand characteristics
okay
sure
you understand that
by giving this deposition
you waive your right
to protection under
the th amendment
yes
doctor
okay ill ask
three test questions
to set up
the variance range
please answer
the second question no
is your name
angela carter
yes
is your name
angela carter
no
were you married
to luke carter
yes
missy did you murder your husband
really counselor
if this is gonna be
for shock value
she volunteered
leonard it okay
no i did not
kill luke
did you kill
your previous husband
really counselor
fine
isnt it true that
your previous marriage
left you financially
upside down
yes i filed bankruptcy
did you marry
luke carter for his money
no
did you have a life
insurance policy
on your husband life
this time
no
would you say
your relationship
with your husband
was bad
no
you argued didnt you
all couples do
how much
like normal i suppose
did it get physical
physical
did he hit you
sometimes
did you ever
call the police
it never got that far
we always worked it out
really
then why did he
want a divorce
i think you have it
backwards
let me ask you this
howd you feel
about his death
it was awful
awful
you have admitted
being in a bad
physically dangerous
relationship
that doesnt mean
you despised him
okay im going
to have to object now
that you hated
your husband
really counselor
this conduct is absolutely
didnt you hate
luke carter
yes
enough to want him dead
yes
let me ask you again
did you kill him
no
did you want
to kill him
no
luke was a very rich
and dangerous man
whose money was
the estate was bankrupt
then you killed him
because you hated him
i wouldnt kill someone
because i hated them
maybe id want to kill them because they felt indifference
like the indifference
mr lewis feels
towards you
see
now you feel like killing
care to try the machine
are you and taylor
involved
no
im sorry
what does this
pertain to exactly
i think we can proceed
to the second phase
of the polygraph
thank you
doctor
is this your number
yes
well
doctor
smooth as silk
every tracer
to every question
in the first
or second phase
is the same
she stung the machine
phifer
how the hell
did she do that
doctor
experience
somehow somewhere
she got the experience
from where
she doesnt have
a criminal record
does she
doctor she studied psychology
some lab curriculums
have polygraph studies
what about
the psych evaluation
she within
the normal range
meaning
her profile shows
she no more pathological
than you or me
it all i could
come up with guys
nothing more to say
ill have a report for you by day end
missy she knew this would happen
she knew it would
jumble everything
she setting us up
telephone rings

she knew it too
taylor
fritkinluke partner
would you look into that
missy
we got a statement
they were trying
to oust each other
but he got a solid alibi
and all the other leads
go nowhere
leaving only her
maybe
when we first met
the thing i admired
most about you
was your capacity
to look past
all doubts
all conflicting
evidence
and focus in on
a conviction
i guess things
have changed
im sorry it come
to this between us
were discussing
a case here
i remember when
we couldnt find
time to discuss them
she so wrong for you
missy she a suspect
in a murder trial
that right
you cant save her
if she guilty
i know that
and youve got to
try it like she is
i am
that crap
she pulling
your strings
letting what happened
to genaro
dont go there
i dont want to
hear about genaro
that was another
mistake we made
thanks for pointing
that out
ill see you tomorrow
clive
with the jury
selection process
having been completed
over the weekend
theyre ready to set in motion
what promises to be
a swift case against
angela carter
wife of the deceased
in hopes of resolving
the deadlock
prosecution evidence gathering
has been meticulous
according to state attorney
jonas phifer
who insists they have
a treasure trove of evidence
to support their claims
good news
the canadians are turning over
all the insurance paperwork
hmm
hello
sorry
what got you
so captivated
im not sure
maybe it the way
luke was killed
i dont follow
well waxman report says
he had the crap beaten
out of him
so
so luke was a big guy
can you see angela carter
roughing him up
choking him breaking a rib
and he didnt
fight back
she didnt have
a scratch on her
so what are you saying
it someone else work now
well it sure
looks that way
missy taylor
how are you feeling
fine
you all ready
for the big roll out
what on your mind
crucify her
excuse me
defile her as a woman
vitiate her
as a human being
whispering
get a life
judge
ladies and gentlemen
of this jury
this case is now in
its presentation stage
you have your instructions
the people will commence
with their opening statements
mr lewis
yes
thank you your honor
good morning
ladies and gentlemen
luke carter
was murdered
with malice aforethought
the motive
despite all appearances
and suggestions otherwise
was simple
greed
a
insurance policy
during the course
of this trial
we will show you
how the carter marriage
had degenerated
into a series of ugly
violent confrontations
so
why didnt she divorce him
because she would
be left penniless
instead she took out
an insurance policy
in his name
murdered him
and then tried to cover it up
but in the end
when all the evidence
is weighed
you will see there are
no other leads
no other suspects
because the murderer
is sitting
here
in front of you
thank you
ladies and gentlemen
mr sheck do you wish
to make your statement now
yes
yes your honor i do
ladies and gentlemen
of the jury
i must begin by
hold on counsel
mrs carter
am i to understand
you wish to relay
this message to the people
yes your honor
actually mr lewis
your honor
i have to object
to your client
counsel is trying
to sabotage this case
dont be ridiculous
gavel bangs
i am warning the both of you
another outburst like that
and youd better get out
your checkbooks
mrs carter
do you understand
the implications
of what youre doing
yes your honor
even though the contents
of this note
could incriminate you
in this trial
i know
very well
i have no precedents
to bar this
but it will be noted
bailiff
your honor
i have to object
i have made
my ruling
a personal note
given to the people
your honor there are
disclosure issues here
only between you
and your client mr sheck
now proceed
in an unprecedented
trial occurrence
mrs carter passed what was
described as a personal note
to deputy state attorney
taylor lewis
at this time
the contents of the note
have not been disclosed
as our viewers may remember
this reporter last year
did an expose about some
of the questionable methods used
by the state attorney office
in the case of karen genaro
although the case
was sealed by a judge
and no evidence ever surfaced
concerning the allegations
the events of today can only
cast a further pall
on the reputation
of mr lewis
and the entire
state attorney office
great ill be right there
ah carmine
whatcha got
okay
sean malloy
managed carter bike shop
for three years now

from this point on
you stay away
do you hear me lewis
i got ears
well for christ sake

so what do we do
about the box
it might be just
another smoke screen
i think missy right
we have to regurgitate
on this one
yeah well i feel
like throwing up myself
oh goddamn it
im tired of your shit
weve got
a fiduciary duty here
youre right we do
but how do we know
he still owed
on those notes
we dont even know
who wrote the letters
at this point
without looking into it
it will just start
more rumors about
the mayor cousin
we dont want that
i dont believe this
i cannot withhold
evidence again
lewis all right
all right
put all your people
on it
everybody quickly
until we know more
nothing is to be disclosed
jonas i cant do this
lewis please
god help me
mrs summers could you
please tell the jury
what you observed just
three days before the murder
first understand that
i was not peeping
that against the law
what with the recent
events we even listed
our house for sale
objection your honor
high society morality
is not on trial here
sustained
mrs summers proceed
i was watching pbs
and i heard yelling
and screaming next door
so i went to the window
and mrs carter was lying
on the tile
beside the pool
mr carter had pushed
her down very hard
objection your honor
she never actually
witnessed him push her
sustained
continue
anyway she was
on the floor
and he started
laughing
so she began
screaming
vulgarities at him
and then she said
she was going
to kill him
what did she
say exactly
im going
to blow your
blanking head off
you son of a blank
you could fill in
the blanks yourselves
and his response
he started yelling back
he said i know
about the insurance
and he knew that
she wanted him dead
then what
then he went inside
and came back
with a shotgun
at this point
i was thinking
oh lordy
he gonna shoot her
did he
no
what happened
he handed her
the shotgun
i was so frightened
i couldnt move
and he was
challenging her
to do it
to shoot him
and i could see her
trembling with rage
and then
suddenly
and nothing
and he started
laughing like
a maniac
so she actually
pulled the trigger
she did
thank you
mrs summers
clive
this week proceedings
went into weekend recess
early today
after sensational testimony
by vera summers
testimony combined with
the other evidence
which many experts say is
so damaging to mrs carter
that the defense may have
to rethink its position
missy
tell me why
were here again
taylor
im just trying to
make sense of what happened
something is not right
she shot him
point blank
trace metal test
shows it
vera summer
testimony today
disputes that
what are you
talking about
i suppose
if she handled the gun
just a few days before
it could be that
jesus youre working
harder at her defense
than sheck
i just want to be sure
indulge me please
earl
gun cocks
okay
if you want to reconstruct
this accurately
stand over there
here
yeah
aim this at his chin
much closer
closer
closer
wow
i know
that what
my estimates show
she couldnt
miss from here
hammer clicks
missy
what
what is it
manny
he wrote the ious
good work
da office
manny
i have some questions
regarding luke carter
russian accent
please sit
let me get you
a drink hm

manny yelling
al
ill be right back

i just want to talk

asshole
im not here
to play games
i could have this place
crawling in blues
in a heartbeat
im clean
well i got these that say otherwise
fuck that bitch
so he wasnt
paying his debts
no he wasnt
fucking paying up
he had us by the balls
carter had you
by the balls
no phifer
luke didnt want
any other rico cases
coming down
phifer
these are phifer debts
who the fuck
did you think
he owed luke
for over a year
but
wait a minute
you guys
had it backwards
the inquisitor
or prosecutor
try district attorney
dickhead
oh this is too bizarre
you heard him
you really think
phifer
i dont know
but im gonna
find out
mcmanus is a lowlife
scumbag whod like
nothing more than
to implicate him
manny worked
for carter
that why the notes
were in the box
it all adds up unless
someone doesnt want it to
like who
like phifer
like someone who has
everything to lose
by this discovery
that a big leap
any bigger than
angela carter killing
luke for his money
but jonas he said
said what
said something
what about me
about carter
he said you were the reason
the rico probe stalled
that you were involved
with her back then
son of a bitch
and you believed him
yeah no
i mean i dont know
i dont know
anything anymore
can you do me a favor
can you run
a credit check on phifer
what will that
accomplish
i dont know
it just a hunch ive got
can you do it
without telling him
thanks missy
mrs geiger
youre in the thai plant
im just making sure
all is kosher
i let your sister in
with the spare key
you keep under the mat
my sister

you should not be here
i heard you the first time
i cant be here

i go anyway
i dont care
im your prosecutor
youre also the only one
who knows im innocent
i know what youre up to
what are you
talking about
i saw you trying
to manipulate missy
at the polygraph test
youre playing
a dangerous game
i want to tell you
what happened
dont
are you that far gone
you dont care about
the truth anymore
when i walked in
luke was already dead
there were pictures
everywhere
what pictures
of me and sean malloy
sean malloy
it was an affair
we had six months ago
round about the time
you bought luke
insurance policy
he made me feel good
like a woman okay
when i ended it
he didnt take it too well
and he became obsessed
oh so he did it now
no
how do you know
i dont know
we didnt find
any pictures
of course not i took them
why
because i walked in
and i picked up the shotgun
then i realized
the mistake i had made
the prints the blood
the pictures everywhere
it looked like
i had done it
with motive
so instead you tried
to make it look like
somebody else had
done it
mob hits go
mostly unsolved
you tampered
with evidence
it beats murder
telephone ringing
yeah
it missy
catherine dead
what
they found her
an hour ago
ahem
hang on
rigor mortis puts
her time of death
between two and
six hours ago
preliminarily
it looks like
strangulation
print work
gone to the lab
was there anything on her
was there anything on her
theyre still looking
thanks
catherine is dead
oh no

lewis message  al im taking angela carter
to the comfort inn on th
i need you to keep an eye on her for me
call me
angela so what really happened with karen genaro
oh it was
a sensational case
karen genaro
was a drug addict
crystal meth
both she and her husband
were addicted to it
one evening
a junkie friend
walks in and finds
karen husband
and their two daughters
stabbed to death
multiple wounds
blood everywhere
karen was in bed
the knife beside her
she was high as a kite
couldnt remember a thing
except some dream she had
in which she was
fighting off some woman
she had never
seen before
the real killer
yup
her husband lover
also a junkie
when did you know
during the trial
missy and i got a tip off
from a backstreet
heroin dealer
it was such bad timing
we were on a roll
everyone wanted a conviction
including me
so i
ignored it
two weeks later
the killer walks
into a police station
and confesses
dna tests
confirmed it
in the meantime
karen genaro had been
murdered in prison
clive johnson
a reporter got wind
decided to play dirty
he paid someone
to get my personal file
in it was a favor
i had done for my father
a couple of years back
when he was arrested
for soliciting
after a drunken night out
with the guys
clive did an expose on
the breaks that family members
of the state attorney office
routinely got
and mentioned
my father name
it broke my mother heart
you shouldnt
blame yourself
for what happened
you didnt do
anything wrong
what do you mean
right and wrong are just
a matter of perspective
yeah
when someone like phifer
crawls into bed
with someone like luke
perspective goes
out the window
they used you
just like they used you
on luke investigation
what do you mean
gambling debts
campaign contributions
what the difference
either will kill a rico probe
what
it common knowledge
well not to me
it isnt
you were
the perfect soldier
rallier of the troops
great record
i mean if the case stalled
who would question
your efforts
even now
fuck me
i already did
youre a decent man
not perfect
but decent
there must be a more
solid trail to phifer
the contributions
who knew about them
hmm fritkin
let pay him
a visit
ill check out
and meet you at the car
hi baby
angela screams
sean
what are you
doing here
things are heating up
we gotta get out of here
you and me
no no i told you
to back off
ive got everything
under control
and im telling you
it all bad
catherine the cops
theyre onto us
onto the tape
where is it
i got it baby
oh okay
i got it come on
wait i cant go with you
you cant go with him
trust me on this
now let go
no no
angela yelling
hey
let go of me
are you okay

imno
sean has the tape
he means to blackmail me
with what on it
which is
i think you know
my god the brakes dont work
hang on
tires screeching
police radio chatter
the brake lines
were cut
look
i know i can be
a jerk off
but you gotta
talk to me
what going on
she may not have
killed her husband
based on what
a lot of things
things i cant really
go into now
but de luca
i could really do with
sean malloy address
could you do that
for me
i need a car as well
thanks
carmine about
the genaro thing
i had nothing
to do with that
i know that now
really thanks
it gonna cost you  bucks
to get your wreck
out of impound
and dont mess up
my car
chanting
money talks
garbage walks
this strike must be
putting you under
a lot of pressure
dont you think
it strange
that we found
the trash contract
on luke carter body
hey
im not the one
on trial here
i could change that
come on that crap
it doesnt take
a rocket scientist
to see that luke and i
were trying to push
each other out
luke was a fucking snake
mongoose eats snake
if luke is dead
and his wife is convicted
this is all yours
all what
this crap
sorry
it a lot of money
in the balance moe
who gets it
what kind of bogus
investigation is this
since when is
the accused killer
allowed on
the investigation
i should fucking
call the mayor
you do that
and while youre at it
why dont you ask her
which of her overseas
accounts she wants
the money
transferred into
i dont know what
youre talking about
i dont want the mayor
i couldnt give a damn
about her
but i want phifer
i want his bank numbers
sorry
cant help you
angela
yes you can
theyre taped
to the underside
of the top drawer
quite a celebrity list moe
ill ask the cops
to patrol the building

i need you to stay put
until i get in touch with you
okay
okay
there are a few things
ive got to do
did you move the files
jonas has them
he taking over
the case

he thinks youre
too involved
too close to the truth
more like
that bastard
he covering
his tracks
his the mayor
and a dozen other
notables
what do you have
enough to bring
them all down
did you get
what i asked for
yeah

he got bank deposits
and credit transfers
from offshore accounts
it matches

registered in maryland
with plates that start

taylor
you too
you wanna get

yeah
let go
de luca
hey one more thing
either of you know
anything about a tape
reporters yelling
mr phifer mr phifer
clive
there are allegations
certain candidates
have been less than ethical
with their campaign financing
would you care to respond
clive as you know
i have always been concerned
with political ethics
and ive outlined
a comprehensive
reform package
that would make elected
officials responsible
for the campaign
funding
my only concern is that
the opposition has been
silent on this issue
how then would you
respond to documents
showing more than
transited
from known mob sources
to your personal
bank accounts
id check my sources
more closely
is this close enough
how it gonna feel
to be prosecuted by
your own team
reporters shouting
state attorney
jonas phifer
on the steps of the state
attorney office
motorcycle engine revs
