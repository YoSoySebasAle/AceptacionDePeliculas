and welcome him

and gentlemen come on give it up

the jim dancers yeah
the jim dancers woo
the jim dancers all right
there they go give it to them
well good evening ladies and gentlemen
my name is jim carrey
and how are you this evening
all righty then
i grew up in canada
is there anybody here
from canada
now i used to get really upset
when i told people
where i came from
down to los angeles
because i always got
the same response
canada wow
mustve been cold
now i just go along with them
yes canada
it was a frozen hostile wasteland
and there was much work to be done
if we were to survive the elements
after boring a hole through the ice
to find food
my good friend nantuk and i
would build an igloo
to protect ourselves
from polar bears
and flying hokey pucks
then
then we would drink a lot of beer
and when nantuk was ready
he would tell me the story
of the great moose
who said to the little squirrel
hey rockey
watch me pull
a rabbit out of my hat
anyway
anyway im here tonight
and i feel good
really good
excellent super
i just wanna go go
go go
i think those subliminal motivation tapes
are starting to make a difference
yeah that right
i listen to motivational tapes
think i wanna get stuck
in this dead end job
no sorry not me
i wanna do something
wonderful
i wanna be one of those
gospel singers on a ptl club
cause those guys are
just happy no matter what
i think i saw him
on the hill the other day
i think i saw him when
i watched the children play
but when i opened up
my voice to sing him praise
he ran away
ran away
far away
my singing made sweet
jesus run away
i did not have to wait
for judgment day
because my song
made the good lord
imagine if you could
actually be that happy
that would be powerful man
people would be tunneling
under the street to avoid you
oh man
is the happy guy still out there
honey looks like i gonna be late again
no it the happy guy
he right beside the car
i cant get near it
of course if i wanna to be that happy
id have to forget all of my problems
and the only time
i forget all my problems
is when im right smack dab
in the middle of sexual orgasm
so i have them
as often as i can
im having one right now
ever had one of those
really smooth orgasms
turns you into elvis
i think that how elvis
got that way actually
but that my only escape
you know
sure i could go on a vacation
but id still be thinking about
what i gotta do when i come home
see to me
an orgasm is like
a mini vacation
but it better because you cant think
about anything when you have one
oh man im way
behind in the red
my kids need braces
what am i gonna do
and youre right back into
the pain of life you know
but for thirty seconds
man youre free
all you can think about is
what the hell am i
gonna grab on to
gee i hope the person im with
doesnt do anything stupid
like move
you ever been with somebody who
wanted to just keep on moving
i used to keep a brick under
my pillow for people like that
it over let it go
we wont go out with her again
that the only time
that the only time
im really truly free
the rest of the time
i sit around
and i worry about
the stupidest things
just stupid things ideas
like what would you do
if you found out your mom
and dad went to hell
wouldnt it just ruin the rest of your life
youd be walking around
they taught me everything i know
i even look like them
of course my mom would
drive the devil crazy
if she ever went to hell
shed spend eternity going
something burning
i can smell that
my mom could always smell
something burning man
i spent half my childhood
feeling the walls for hot spots
nine times out of ten
it was my father
see like a lot of smokers
his favorite cigarette of the day
was that one right after dinner
you know
during his nap
fun watch him
to wake up though
oh god
drop and roll dad
i just worry too much
though i dont know
maybe there is nothing
to worry about maybe
maybe there is no
actual place called hell
maybe hell is
having to listen to your grandparents
breath through their nose
when theyre eating a sandwich
get that humming thing
it not a meal it
a struggle for life itself
i think ill make
another one
noooo
no
well be good
here a scary
concept though
getting old
you cant do that
you gotta kiss that
stuff goodbye man
i just wanna keep challenging
myself you know
i dont wanna become
the reminiscing guy
you know people run into
at bars and stuff
can always tell how
boring their life is
by how far back they
have to reach for glory
theyre like
remember
remember how fast
i used to be
when i was a sperm
ill never forget
the day of the big race
there were millions
of us in the field
but i beat them all
to fertilize that egg mister
back in the cervix
i was semen first class
dont wanna be like that
see for me
for me jimmy stewart is
the kind of guy that id love to be
it very difficult to be
that though you know
i mean he is just kinda
up here somewhere
and i just want
i love him man
it a great example
of somebody who had
an incredibly productive life
seems like no matter
what happens
no matter how
bad things get
jimmy stewart can look
at it in a positive way
well i guess we gonna have
ourselves a nuclear holocaust
oh hey everybody
come on over the window
look at that mushroom cloud
isnt it beautiful
and and the amazing thing to me
is that-that something so
magnificent
colorful could just
melt your face right off
that positive energy
you know
you gotta look death
right in the face
that what jimmy
stewart would do
hi mister death you look like
you could use some soup
id wanna be
like that man
maybe i will be
maybe someday after im
finished singing the gospel
ill go even further
and become
a real holy man
and im not talking about the kind
of holy men you see on tv
those tv evangelists
they are not holy men
they are just ambitious
i saw one guy
who was so ambitious
he actually became
jealous of the lord
you could tell it came out half way
through the ceremony he said
when i was a child
i wanted to be
the savior of the world
then they told me that jesus
was the son of god and i realize
it all who you know
very petty petty people you know
cant be like that if you
wanna be a holy man
and you gotta be
sure of yourself too
when you make a decision
you cannot waver in any way
you gotta stick with it
youd never see gandhi
during a hunger strike
sneaking into the kitchen
in the middle of the night
gandhi
what are you doing down here
um
i thought i heard
a prowler
and i was going to hit him
over the head
with this giant bowl
of potato salad
he would never put himself
in that position you know
and you gotta control your
temper constantly you know
you cannot fly off the handle
at any moment
you gotta be right
in the center
jesus was very composed his whole
live and right up to the end
if that was me
id be up there going
great
just beautiful
you guys are gonna get it
wait till my father
hears about it
thatd be a whole
different book man
then there are those weird impulses
we get constantly you know
we have to fight them off
every days of our lives
those mad little
impulses we get
and everybody gets them too
like youd be with a friend
could be your best friend
in a whole world
standing about two feet
away talking to you
you are thinking
my goodness
i could just fire out
and hit him right now
he would never expect it
see madness is never
that far away
it as close as saying yes
to the wrong impulse
but people who stay sane are the people
who can make those quick decisions
should i stick my finger
into the fan
or leave the room
right now
should i run the blade of this razor
across my tongue
or just finish shaving
and move away from the sink
come on
youre right there
but you dont
because luckily
most of us have that little voice
inside our head that says
turning the car
in the oncoming traffic
is counterproductive
imagine if we didnt
have that voice man
i wouldnt even
be here right now
id be in the shark
tank at sea world
he got my legs
he got my legs
wed be apologizing
till the end of time
hi how are you
sorry man
you guys enjoying the show
wow excuse me jeez
sorry about that
just came into my head and i
made a decision i dont know
it a
i hate to turn my back
on the audience i really do
i think nine out of ten of the worst
impulses we get though
are when we are behind the wheel
of a car you know
that why i dont think
it a good idea
to carry a gun
in the glove compartment
cause chances are
if it there
sooner or later
you gonna use it
of course then again
what are you gonna do
if somebody cuts you off
in the freeway
just let them go
you pretty much have to
shoot them you know
otherwise they
wont learn nothing
or
say all of a sudden you have to
go on a real killing spree
and all you have
is a knife
well after the couple of people
your arm is aching
you have to switch hands
and you look like a girl
stop laughing and die
who needs that kind
of aggravation man
when there are automatic
weapons on sale
that why a lot of my friends are taking
martial arts classes and stuff like that
which i think
is a really good idea
anybody in
the martial arts here
come on
right now baby
try and penetrate
my crab hands
he a crustacean
somebody get some
boiling water
i think that a good idea to know
how to defend yourself though
i really do
i just wish the people
who took martial arts
would master the technique before
they go around showing it off
because it really annoying
when they come up to you and go
hey man
i just learned this incredible
new move in karate today
but you gotta
come at me like this
jeez is there anything i can do
to make it easier for ya
maybe i can put my head under
the back wheel of your car
hey im a mugger
kick me in the groin
and i pop my eyes out
that how it goes
down in the street
that how it goes
down man
give me you money
no
all right then im gonna
have to stab ya
with my right hand
in a lunging fashion
try to keep your weight
on a back leg
what world is this
what wonderful world
gee he does it all
of course i dont think
wed need any of this stuff if wed
just communicate to each other
of course if you wanted to do that
youd have to find some kinda language
that everyone understood
myself
i think that music
i happen to love it
how am i supposed to live without you
michael bolton
what happened to him
i dont know he tried to sing
like michael bolton
something just popped
in his head
that guy tries really
hard doesnt he
no he puts a lot
into a song come on
he is 99% effort
that man
god id hate to
id hate to go to one
of his concerts
by the end of it hed have
a big bubble on his head
they want an encore cut me
i love the way he sings
im just afraid for him that all
oh we should open up
the parameters
of the music we
listen to you know
it really bothers me that
the people in this country
dont know about
the incredible pop music
coming out of
the middle east right now
i like to be the one
who bring it to the west
come on clap your hands
ill do it myself
we dont get to listen
to that do we
what going on man
it all about payola isnt it
we should try to put
ourselves in their shoes
for a change
wake up in the morning
pick the sand
out of your teeth
turn on that radio dial
that was hatiba by cool abdul
coming up next libya rap
dj jazzy mahakhnubar
and a fresh rafsanjani
but first
a word from our hostage
they mean business
send more guns
communication
hardest thing in the world
you know i can look at you guys
i can communicate to you all night
but one on one
im terrible
just the certain things about communicating
that really bother me
you know
like whenever i meet
somebody new i say
hi how are you
most of the time people hear that
theyll say something like
good and yourself
im fine thank you very much
but sometimes they
like to surprise you
ive got no dream man
im all dead inside
im sorry wrong answer
but thank you for playing
man if im worried about something
i dont even leave my house anymore
because i know there is five people
waiting out there somewhere
just to ask me that question
hey jim
how are you
and i go
really good
please look away
danger danger danger
i should change the response
or something you know
how am i
jee i dont know
let me check
id like to do
a few more tests
thank you
the weird thing is though
weve gotten so used to hearing this
hi how are you
that if somebody doesnt say it
we answer it anyway
hi bob
good and you
and the conversation
goes nowhere
because all you can here is
that voice in your head going
he thinks youre an idiot
he gonna tell everyone
kill him
kill hiiim
and you have to make one
of those decisions again you know
see i think body language is
the communication of the future
for instance if youre
staying like this
it means
hey girls
im single
and i have a curvature
of the spine
you gotta put it
out there you know
and guys seriously
the walk is everything
the walk is the most
important element
if you wanna whole room full
of ladies to know what you want
without them getting a wrong idea
walk into a singles bar like this
see this puts out a definite
message you know
it says
listen
listen i could care less but
my crotch would like
to buy you a beer
you gotta do something
like that you know
believe me
these days women have heard
every line there is to say
guys you gotta get in there
with something visual
and distract them
hey baby
come here for a second
yeah you come on over here
listen uh
listen do you
do you find it unusually windy today
thank you very much
you guys have been great
i had a wonderful time
thank you
