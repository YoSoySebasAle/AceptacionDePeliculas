crickets chirping
lively music
director how you feeling
very excited
making history
and also there gonna be a lot
of very pleased people at the school
it not just a tech thing
it not just a new invention
it something that can
actually help real people
so it fun to do that and exciting
it gives it all meaning
not just interest
director living at
the bottom of africa
can really make world
affairs feel like things
that just happen somewhere else
so in  when i heard the
word bitcoin for the first time
i made it my mission to find out
what is so wrong with the way things are
that people are trying
to change the financial
system for everyone
the thing about storytelling though
the story you expect is
never the one you find
i reached out to friends to find out
who knew about this thing called bitcoin
and i was pointed in the
direction of lorien gamaroff
within four minutes of receiving my email
about being interviewed on bitcoin
lorien responded saying
yes i do believe that
this will impact our lives
as much as the internet has done
so can you first explain to
me what cryptocurrency is
all it is essentially is
a mechanism for being able
to transfer digital assets
without there having
to be a duplicate of that digital asset
ill give you an example
if you have an mp or a digital photo
it very easy to make a copy
of that digital photo or mp
and send it to multiple friends
or what this term is called double spend
in  an anonymous
developer or engineer
or financial guru devised a way
to create a digital currency
which essentially solved that problem
where you could create a digital asset
that could be transferred
from entity to another
and couldnt be easily copied
in  i read a blog
about an underground website
that was using this new internet
currency that was different
from any other currency that
had ever come before it
and i immediately decided to
try and play around with it
and see where it would go
and acquired a number of them
when they were worth very little
and then over the years ive
just seen the usage explode
and people come around to the idea
that this could very will
be the next innovation
that disrupts and upturns our lives
and has a massive positive impact
there are thousands of
cryptocurrencies out there
and theyre quite diverse in terms
of what their intentions are
and what they were designed to do
so for me the discussion
begins with bitcoin
it the the proto cryptocurrency
it the first one that mattered
when you first geek out about bitcoin
and blockchain and cryptocurrency
you tend to become very
excited about the tech itself
and i think i made the mistake
quite a few times early on
of getting too technical
when im just speaking
to my mum or my wife or friends
who just want to understand how it works
it digital money
director in
we attended the bitcoin
and blockchain africa conference
so we could hear people
who get it explain it
there was a woman on stage from
botswana who educates people
on both the potential
and risks of bitcoin
after she shared her personal story
i snuck over and slipped a
piece of paper into her hand
with the hastily scrawled words
im making a documentary and
i would love to interview you
come come come
whistling
goats bleating
welcome to my farm
this is a very small farm
that i started in
when the bitcoin market went a bit up
i managed to buy the goats
and i bought myself some chickens
and i set up the farm
and i also managed to buy myself this car
that is why it has got all
these bitcoin stickers
you can come and check out my goats
they are like way cool
the other ones are not yet here
i think theyre still in the bush
the humble beginnings laughing
im hoping in the future
ill have much much wider farm
as i continue in my journey of bitcoin
so this is a bitcoin farm
but instead of mining
bitcoin im mining goats
laughing
the piece of land i got it in
so from  until
there was nothing happening
i couldnt clean it up
because i didnt have money
some of my goats are coming
it one of my passions
besides teaching people about bitcoin
my husband is the one
who is always coming here
most of the time
because as for me im always
busy doing my education
and doing my satoshi centre
and sometimes touring
people have flooded
africa with a lot of scams
and a lot of our people are
falling into those scams
so im not basically
only focused on botswana
where education is needed i go
laughing
bells dinging
the whole idea of the farm
is so that i can be
able to sustain myself
im just educating people
without making any profit out of it
for me education is very important
even though i get stressed
when my life is not
working according to plan
and my vision for the satoshi centre
is not really accomplished i would say
but im always grateful
for the bitcoin community
because they are really
a super amazing family
everyone in the bitcoin
space theyre amazing
soft music
director the original document
that outlined the vision to
reinvent the world of finance
and technology was released in
against the backdrop of
the financial crisis
in order to understand all of that
the most obvious place to start was money
what is money
where did it come from
and why isnt the way it
works working for us anymore
one of the first things
we figured out to do
that really distinguished us
from the other animals on this
planet was invent language
and a way of communicating with each other
that could convey very complicated ideas
we could have armies of s
or s of individuals
where other great apes would only be able
to organize in clusters of
up to about  individuals
so that gave us an edge
language was extremely powerful
as an organizing mechanism
but the thing we needed next was a way
of making our trust in
each other portable
we used seashells
baboon bones were a popular
form of currency in africa
but money is and always has
been a form of an iou note
i could give you something
and you could trust that
that thing had value because
society believed it did
things like dollars and rands
we call those fiat currencies
and fiat is a latin word
that means let it be done
it basically means that they have value
because governments say they do
governments tell us that
you will use this money
you will accept it as repayment of debt
and you will pay your
taxes in this currency
so it really is just
is because we say so
there was a period where fiat currencies
were backed by the gold standard
and now really money is just backed
by a government ability
to enforce taxation
within its borders
governments or their
central banking authorities
can print as much money as they want to
the decision to print money
is something that lies
with a few individuals
it open to flawed decision
making and really it fair
to say that fiat money
isnt backed by anything
soft music
director for a time
bitcoin felt like a lot of talk
and very little action
but lorien was taking
bitcoin out of academia
out of the future
and creating a real
world use for it in
something tangible for the world to see
if you consume electricity
youre gonna have a meter
installed at your property
there two modes that
that meter can be in
either postpaid or prepaid
postpaid is where you
just consume the utility
and at the end of the
month somebody will come
and read your meter and
then send you a bill
and then you pay
youre consuming first and then you pay
now prepaid meters are
trying to solve the problem
where people are consuming
and then not paying
which is a problem we have
and it showing itself
in our energy provider
eskom where they say
they dont have enough money
to maintain the power stations
because they cant recover
from the municipalities
the municipalities cant recover
because nobody wants
to pay for the utility
theyve already consumed it
so theyre trying to close that gap
by switching all their
customers on to prepaid
so they cant consume unless theyve paid
but it then introduces another problem
from a consumer point of view
at least  of africans are unbanked
if they want to make a
payment they have to use cash
obviously now the costs are increased
because the vendor has costs
and there traveling
costs security costs
so although prepaid systems
will solve the recovery from
the utility point of view
it doesnt solve anything from
the consumer point of view
bitcoin is a payment system
which is an electronic payment system
that is outside of the banking system
anybody who has an app
on their mobile phone
it doesnt even have to be a smartphone
they can easily become
part of the bitcoin economy
and have access to electronic payments
so it just a common sense
thing if you think about it
that being able to make
bitcoin a payment method
for a prepayment system
opens up that massive market
and it has opportunity to
drastically reduce costs
and increase efficiency
at least from the
perspective of the consumer
so now there a solution bitcoin
and applied to smart metering
can solve a massive
problem throughout africa
as well as latin america and asia pacific
birds chirping
greeting in foreign language
i started my journey with bitcoin
in a little bit of a sad way
director can you tell me that story
my son right here on the wall
in  i gave birth to a baby boy
his name was called
pako which means praise
he was born with a heart defect
called hypertrophic
obstructive cardiomyopathy
i was looking for ways in
which i can raise money
and probably take him overseas
it was kind of difficult here in botswana
for them to promise me anything
one time the doctor told me
that there literally
nothing that they can do
when we brought to south
africa i was very happy
i said my son would get help
but they said to me for us
to be able to help your son
we finish first with the
list that is in south africa
for children who need transplants
so i went online to try and do freelancing
so maybe i can be able to raise more funds
to be help my child
then i remember i got across a survey
where they say you can do a survey
and you can be paid in bitcoin
i went through that worked my heart out
i never got any bitcoins
from the work that i did
a lot of things that i met were scams
one scam after another
and then in april on the
th my son died so yeah
soft music
the first time i heard about bitcoin
was to raise money for my son
so when he died i felt
like i have lost the purpose
for why i should work online
so i just stopped
something was just nagging me in my head
like you need to go back
to that bitcoin thing
and look at it and see if
it can be of any worth
the more i read the more i get learned
i decided let me take
another step further
it no longer about my son
now it about changing my country
it about changing the people
i will group together people
and i will teach them about bitcoin
so  i did my first meetup
but before the meetup i did a video
which i put on youtube
i did an old tshirt
with my bitcoin address
and i was like i want
to work for this company
even by then i dont even
understand what bitcoin was
like for me it was more like a company
then  my group was growing
and i kept on educating
people about bitcoin
from that moment onwards
director so why can
we trust that crypto
is worth something
bitcoin as a primary
example has a finite supply
which makes it a deflationary currency
it actually in very real
terms is scarcer than gold
there no central
authority that can decide
to raise interest rates
or to print more money
as a part of quantitative easing
the bitcoin network runs itself
once the network was set in motion
that system runs by consensus
director can you tell me about usizo
lorien sure imagine
a poor school in africa
they have a bitcoin meter
anybody from anywhere
in the world could pay
for a week or month worth of electricity
directly without having to
go to that organization
i actually thought instead of
just talking about something
why dont i go and do it
director what does usizo mean
usizo is a zulu word it means help
soft music
the whole point of this project
is to kind of relieve the
burden of the electricity
i mean obviously
there a lot more things
to be paid for in the school
and these schools have small budgets
if they can have that
burden lifted a little
where they dont have to
actually pay for the utilities
then they can then spend
what little they have
on other things
one of the struggles that weve had
is trying to get a metering
company to agree to the project
a lot of these metering
companies make a lot of money
on the vending solutions theyve supplied
taking the fees from
the fiat transactions
now having a
blockchainbased system means
that the funds go directly
through to the meter
and so the metering companies
that weve been dealing with
werent willing to go
along with the project
so it was quite an uphill struggle
but luckily we have found
some enlightened partners
weve got about two bars out of the three
so i think communication should be fine
but we also have an antenna
so what we can do is perhaps
bring an antenna through here
just to boost the signal
so once we get the
donation going through
and the meter can pick up the
payment on the blockchain
the next step is for the
actual meter to switch on
and then we should see
the school light up
it will be hard to see now
but at least well see something happen
and then on monday night
when it all pitchdark
i think itll be quite spectacular
when everything goes on
that the theory very exciting
lively music
the blockchain is the
operating system that it runs on
so you can see it as your windows
or your linux or macos x
the software layer is the blockchain
and bitcoin is an app that
runs on top of the blockchain
director blockchain is
the magic behind the money
but really it just a
decentralized database
stored on a very large network
of computers all over the world
it is the technology
that underpins bitcoin
and other cryptocurrencies
but it not just for
monetary transactions
you can use it to store
data like patents or wills
or to exchange anything of value
such as products properties
services and even votes
the authenticity of the exchange
of value or transactions
is verified by the community as a whole
rather than by a single
entity removing the risk
of a single point of
failure in the system
each transaction is recorded
on a public distributed ledger
that can be viewed by anyone in the world
the blockchain is a
decentralized system
and the strength of the blockchain
is that everybody
checking everybody else
no single institution is in
charge of this information
now that differs from the
current financial system
that we actually do
have all over the world
in the case of south africa
in the center of our financial system
is the south african reserve bank
and the reserve bank
checks all the other banks
and all the other banks check us
and that the difference
between a decentralized system
the blockchain for example
and a centralized system
if i for example want to
give you government money
or central bank money and i do a transfer
from my cellphone to your cellphone
it is impossible for me to transfer money
from one bank account directly
into another bank account
we think that is what happens
but what really happens is that
i send a message to my bank
which will send a message
to the central bank
which will send a message to your bank
to make a deposit into your bank account
so there somebody else always in charge
there always a middle man somewhere
between my account and your account
soft music
director so who invented
blockchain and bitcoin
the creator of bitcoin
the cryptocurrency
and the technology is satoshi nakamoto
people think it a group of people
or it could be an individual
he a complete mystery
noone knows who he is
people have their suspicions
i have my suspicions as well
several people have come out
to claim that they are satoshi nakamoto
i think it quite nice
that it a mystery
i like the fact that
i dont know who it is
and i think we would be disappointed
if we found out who it was
director so why did
you name your dog satoshi
laughing
bitcoin and cryptocurrency
and blockchain technology
has taken over my life
i love bitcoin i really do
and i like what it stands for
and the name suits him completely
laughing
ill organize small
talks and ill go around
ive been in gabarone
and i went to francestown
to go and teach people about bitcoin
i met students who are into it
we talked blockchain and all that
and i began to tell them
about the possibility
of changing the way
things are in our country
the way things are in the world
i was inspired by satoshi nakamoto
liberating the people
from what was happening
during the financial crisis
coming up with something that
would really help people
the satoshi centre vision
was to create a community lab
where people can come
and learn about bitcoin
and also be able to be very creative
somebody came up with this
idea of making it possible
to trust the record of ownership of money
without trusting any
individual in the ecosystem
that makes things work together
and that is such a clever invention
that we have to make it work
and make it valuable in the
way we apply it to society
if you compare it to the
traditional financial system
i dont think any of us really get excited
about going to our bank
or excited about logging
onto a banking system
one of the disadvantages of cryptocurrency
is the complexity stall
that were working with a
very rough technical thing
where you need to understand things
like the transaction fees
and things like that
but to be fair if you compare it
to the traditional financial system
that not really clear as crystal either
it really very difficult to understand
how banking fees are
going to apply to you
what it going to cost
to transfer   rands
to a us bank account
things like that are
also very very complex
soft music
what were gonna
basically do is an auction
the item in question is this over here
which is a  rand note
youre gonna be bidding
for this  rand note
it a standard auction
whoever wins the auction
gets the  rand note
a slight switch though on
the traditional auction model
is that the person who comes second
has to pay whatever their bid was
but they dont get the note
so im gonna open it up at  rand
would anybody pay me
rand for a  rand note
who first
rand we got  rand in the back
rand going once
rand going twice
sold for  rand
you can come and settle afterwards
and the person who came second
needs to settle with me as well
laughing
it not that central financial
authorities were a bad idea
it gave us a way of scaling up to what now
is the global financial system
it gave us a way of
trading with each other
you could travel to the
other side of the world
and you could start to
trade with people there
and that was fantastic
but where it has failed us
for example is where
human greed has been able
to manipulate the system
to put it quite bluntly
that the second highest price
ive ever gotten for a  rand note
it a great game for me
because i essentially
now have made  rand
and parted with  rand right
the game of course is rigged
it designed so that im gonna win
and it has to do with
the irrational mindset
people have around money
we all remember what happened
with the financial crisis in
in that situation we were reminded again
that banks can fail
we have a fractional
reserve banking system
in most countries where
banks dont actually
have to have all of the money
that theyre storing on
behalf of their customers
they only need to keep
enough of that money around
that they can satisfy all
of the withdrawals requested
in any given period
when a bank gives you a loan
to buy a house for example
they dont have to have that money either
that basically money they
can make out of thin air
but when you have a run on the bank
when there a crisis
and everybody tries to pull their money
out of the banking
system at the same time
banks dont have that money
and that causes them to collapse
governments then stand
as what we call a lender of last resort
so governments say if the
bank doesnt have enough money
to sort out all of its customers
well step in and well lend
them the money to do that
but of course that money needs
to come from somewhere too
and so what happened in
was you had banks
which didnt have enough money
to pay all of the people
trying to withdraw their money
the us government
didnt have enough money
to act as a lender of last resort
and so the us taxpayer
effectively had to bail out a bank
with a taxfree nonreversible loan
that never had to be paid
back to the taxpayer
now it doesnt really matter
how you present that story
it doesnt strike me as fair
director every country
economy is intertwined
with every other country economy
imports exports investments
and the world reserve currency
meant that the financial crisis in america
became the global financial crisis
the saying before
was that the banks were too big to fail
but the bigger they are
the harder they fall
over a decade later
there are now banks that are even bigger
than the toobigtofail banks
of the financial crisis years
hi my name is bheki mahlobo
and i have a question
for the chief economist
so im an economics student
and im not sure if youve noticed
but a lot of people in the bitcoin space
they know more about economics
than most phd students
in universities actually
crowd laughing
this is because in university
were not particularly exposed
to different other schools
of economic thought
like the austrian school
of economics for example
and if were not exposed to certain things
then we wont question certain things
for example like money
in school were not particularly
taught what money truly is
what is your opinion of bitcoin being used
as a way to escape this
economy that exists right now
youre absolutely right
that in our universities
we should teach other
schools of thought as well
and a very important school of thought
is the school of thought of real freedom
and ive got a suspicion
this new technology will
really put the power
in the hands of the individuals
and allow us to experience
that real real freedom
and not to enslave us the way
that politicians have been enslaving us
for the last couple of hundred years
this is a real freedom
but not only is it real freedom
it very very dangerous and with that
goes a huge responsibility as well
director yearolds dont normally
go to events like we did the other day
yeah yeah
director that not a
normal yearold thing to do
usually like clubs
and stuff right yeah
the first time i heard about bitcoin
was from a movie called dope
this movie doesnt cover
bitcoin in a positive light
and then i heard it again and i was like
maybe let me look at it and
do a little bit more research
and that where i fell
down the rabbithole
as the saying says
my economics teacher
was heavily into gold
so he was explaining
central banking right
and fractional reserve banking
and inside i was like whoa
this seems a little bit shady
he explained that we actually
dont need the system
in a normal economy things are supposed
to get cheaper over time
not expensive over time
and the common thing that
im hearing on the news
or youtube is that no we need inflation
so that there economic growth
i did a little bit more digging
and then that when i found mises
they follow the austrian
school of economics
and then they explain that no
we actually dont need
inflation for economic growth
and in fact that whole statement
is a whole contradiction in itself
when you define economic growth
it the increase in production
and the increase in production
causes prices to decrease
an example of this would be technology
when the first phone came
out it was quite expensive
and then eventually
there was a lot of people
contributing to different designs
basically providing
alternatives to smartphones
and then the prices of
smartphones decreased over time
that also could apply
to the economy as well
and now i know this person
what he saying on tv
is utter nonsense
and then what can i do about it
it like buy bitcoin bruh
soft music
using this greedy algorithm
i can make a lot of money
and actually the only way
you couldve won that game
was to not play it
the problem is when you
have money on the table
human beings start acting
in a very curious way
but i wanna use this auction as an example
of our banking system
and in fact the financial system
that runs the world today
because it is rigged
there are rules that have
been put in place that mean
that you will lose every time you play
and somebody will make a lot of money
because they control the algorithm
that ensures that you lose
our current banking systems
while theyre useful for
things like being carrots
and going to the movies and stuff
are exploitive and theyre exclusionary
and they cut out a lot of the world
and we dont have to play the game anymore
because we have the
technology now to opt out
money was always centralized
was always opaque
was always exclusionary
had too many middlemen
too many rentseekers too
many people quite frankly
benefiting from exploiting others
finally we could use the internet
to create a financial system
that benefited everybody potentially
that was resistant to censorship
that nobody could take control of
that what the world had been waiting for
and finally it arrived
with the bitcoin network
i was never interested
in all these subjects
this economics and finance
and since bitcoin i became interested
and i would still be
living in my oblivious way
hoping that whoever running
the system is running it fine
and that we dont end up in the same way
that zimbabwe ended up where
their money became worthless
it not so much about not
having a longterm view
it just about being educated on this
and the majority of people
arent educated on this
can i just go on and say something else
that i think it is important
director absolutely absolutely
okay if we use a blockchain system
the power is actually where
i believe it should be
and that in the hands
of the individuals
we do not need the
permission to transfer money
between my account and your account
and that of course also
opens the possibility
for things like for example fraud
and tax evasion and all
sort of illegal things
and the responsibility
is also in the hands
of the individuals the
way i believe it should be
director why
why should we have that
kind of responsibility
in all instances when governments
got involved with money
in all instances without
one single exception
they have either destroyed the money
or they are in the
process of destroying it
so dont think that a
politician or central bank
is in the position that
you can always trust him
it just another individual
just another human
and they always make
mistakes and it inevitable
but ideologically i also believe
that i should have the
right to decide for myself
whether i want to lend you money
whether i want to borrow money
it not up to some politician
or some other institution
to tell me what i can and what i cant do
that my business
soft music
director there exists
a definite twocamp divide
over whether bitcoin should
be used to facilitate liberty
and selfsovereignty or
if it should be regulated
to protect users
can you give me an example of
some of these crazy schemes
that people are coming
up with using crypto
there so many
i remember but most of them
coming from south africa
laughing
so in the very beginning i
remember they used to call me
and try to recruit me
they say like youve
got a network of people
you can make a lot of money
im like i would rather be poor
than to join something
that at the end of the day
ill hurt my own people
there always a joining thing
it like a pyramid scheme
the lady came to our office
she was really heartbroken
because she has put a lot
of money into a scheme
and then it disappeared
people actually put in
their children school fees
what i know is once you start
having an influx of people
calling and saying they want bitcoin
know that there a scheme coming up
so theyre good in a sense
maybe they make bitcoin
to be used a lot
but at the same time theyre really bad
the bad surpasses the good
one of the biggest challenges
to explaining bitcoin
is to somebody who comes
already with the preknowledge
of what bitcoin is and then
they come to you and say like
how much do i join
how would i make money very quick
you try to convince the person
that it not about joining
it like a revolution
it like a new technology
arising altogether
it about you understanding
theyre like no but it not that
the pros for me is liberation freedom
the ability to control your own money
or the ability to send any
amount of crypto or carry it
imagine if you were to
carry a chunk of gold
you want to pass through the
border or whatever you cant
so that the beauty of bitcoin
the negativity is people using it wrongly
making our people poor
also lack of regulations and stuff
if you can have maybe some
sort of regulatory framework
it will also help protect us
i know you cannot control it
because of the way it was created
but just regulations it
can help a little bit
lively music
director since bitcoin early days
it been shrouded in
mystery and controversy
from the bankruptcy of mt gox
one of the early exchanges
to the infamy caused by the
dark web silk road marketplace
that accepted bitcoin for
nefarious goods and services
while silk road became one
of the first use cases for bitcoin
it also perhaps put
the mainstream adoption
of cryptocurrencies years behind
where it might have been otherwise
it was run by dread pirate
roberts or ross ulbricht
if you follow the news you
know that ross ulbricht
was found guilty by a jury
the federal judge took his
activities very serious
and she actually sentenced
him to serve a life sentence
they counted at least six individuals
who had purchased
narcotics off of silk road
and died as a result
what we basically are focused on
one is criminal offenses
involving digital currency
which could be any sort of
crime whether it narcotics
whether it murderforhire
whether it identity theft and so on
in which the bad guys
are utilizing bitcoin
rather than other forms of money
because they in our experience
believe it to be untraceable
which is clearly an
accident on their part
a misunderstanding to say
the least crowd laughing
but we also deal with the
regulation of exchanges of money
woman mumbling
lorien very nice
dont touch dont touch
no you must be careful
every single transaction that
occurs in the bitcoin network
is recorded in something
called the blockchain
a public ledger of every
transaction that made
the only problem is that
even though you can see
every single transaction
and you can see the addresses
which are like the account
numbers of the people
that are holding those bitcoins
you dont actually know who
those addresses belong to
so the correct term isnt
anonymous it pseudonymous
cash is truly anonymous
if you have a suitcase of
cash and you go and spend it
there no way that that
transaction is recorded
so bitcoin is less anonymous than cash
and we certainly know how cash can be used
for nefarious purposes
we know that suitcases of money
and drug deals happen all the time
director there was a
name that kept coming up
in conversation and research
and for his name alone it
felt necessary to meet him
fluffy pony
it a nickname that stuck years ago
that despite his best efforts
riccardo is not able to get rid of
but amongst the noise of the crypto world
fluffy pony definitely stands out
why is privacy so important
and how is it lacking in the
way we currently do things
privacy is the natural state of things
youre not closing the
door at the bathroom
because you want to plot to
overthrow the government
youre closing the door at the bathroom
because you dont want
people to see you on the loo
there certain aspects of our
life we wanna keep private
that we might reveal to certain people
we hopefully take our clothes off
in front of the person were married to
but we dont go and walk around
the shopping center naked
but privacy has become it
sort of become overshadowed
by oh bad people want privacy
or things like if you
have nothing to hide
then why do you care about privacy
it not about wanting
to hide it from everyone
it just that we wanna control
who sees the information
if law enforcement or the government
want information about me
they should have to come knock on my door
to get that information
they shouldnt be able to
just get that information
because my bank is telling them
about every transaction ive ever done
lively music
i know people say there is
information on the internet
but it different
if im able to really
expand on the information
maybe you picked from the internet
and make you understand
it makes me feel good
because i know ive empowered you
you will take the same knowledge
and you give it to someone
so if im able to reproduce
someone who does what i do
soft music
that the real deal
that the real deal yeah
had it not been for him
i wouldnt be doing what im doing
he made me to know about bitcoin
so because i was trying to
help him during that time
now im helping people with knowledge
so it like transferring
whatever i wanted to do for him
now he somehow doing it
for the people through me
ill continue to honor him yeah
hell be my baby forever
laughing
yep yeah
when i got introduced to
bitcoin it like okay
let me save each month
i save i save i save
i think more about the future
what gonna happen in the future
and i orientate my actions
today thatll impact the future
i mean that the reason
why im studying right
im like it seems like some
really interesting stuff
in the space of crypto
im not saying im against banking
im just against
fractional reserve banking
so i orientate my actions towards that
the new financial system
i would be a lot more stressed
if i didnt have bitcoin honestly
director why
let say for example
if we have the central bank
government decides like
yo im gonna print like two trillion rand
into the economy
the consequences of that
would be hyperinflation
i cant remember who said
this but it says like
bitcoin not about getting
your money out of the country
it about getting your
country out of your money
essentially it like
protecting your savings
protecting your stored value
that why im into bitcoin
i think the financial
crisis started a discussion
that bitcoin then accelerated
around why the financial
system works the way it does
and whether or not it
should work that way
how can we make it more transparent
how can we make it more fair
how can we improve the world
of money for everybody
but it was a very difficult discussion
to have with people in
the early days of bitcoin
i was writing for finweek
magazine at the time
and i did a story on bitcoin in
and some of my colleagues
literally laughed at me
they were like this is the dumbest thing
weve ever heard of it a bubble
itll never be worth more than
at its height it was worth
and it gonna be worth a
lot more than that one day
and every time we see this cycle
we have people laughing
it not gonna last
it overinflated
and every time theyre right
for a very short period of time
and then every time theyre proven
ultimately wrong in the mediumterm
i believe that one day
it something that you
wont have to understand
it just makes your life better
very few people can tell you
exactly how their smartphone works
it doesnt matter because the narrative
has become about why it good for them
what does it enable in their lives
well i can speak to my grandchildren
i can stay uptodate with the news
i can take pictures of my family
those are the things that matter
how the processor works
and all of the software
that makes it possible
nobody really needs to
understand the bits and pieces
crowd chattering
welcome to emaweni in
the middle of the night
director at two
oclock in the morning
i followed lorien out to soweto
to witness history being made
with a live demonstration of
his bitcoin prepaid meter
lorien would be skyping
through to a conference
on the other side of the
world at mit in boston
where his friend ed would
be making a bitcoin payment
straight to the meter
so what im gonna do
is im actually going to
be ready okay so let get
this whole thing started
theyre gonna be calling right now
in about two minutes
and then im gonna come to that classroom
woman okay
shame theyve been here
for two hours three hours
they got here at
computer ringing
hi ed
ed this is a pack room here
hi everybody
can you see all of them
hi nice to see you
all thanks for coming
ed could you shortly
explain where you are
and what youre doing there
sure im in a city outside
of johannesburg in south africa
it called soweto
where i am right now is very close
to where nelson mandela
used to live in his youth
and im in a small school
were gonna be demonstrating
our blockchain prepaid metering system
so this is now one of
the electrical boxes
i dont think you can actually see
but there is a dog barking
this is now just a conventional meter box
but there a blockchain
enabled meter over there
and what were gonna do now is
im gonna go to the classroom
and there some teachers
there and it all dark
and ed gonna now make the transaction
ed how long
does the transaction take
lorien the transaction takes about
it should take about  seconds
people chattering
all right
go for it
okay and now we wait i guess
and we hope it works
so yeah now what happening
is it now going through the blockchain
the meter gonna detect the payment
it gonna calculate the tariff
and then load the required
amount of electricity
onto the meter
so there nothing on it at the moment
that why were in the dark
and hopefully in a few seconds
the meter should be activated
im actually sitting in
one of the classrooms here
so you can see
the staff here ready
chuckling
this should be a few about  seconds
ed  seconds
seconds okay
all right
ed maybe you should
just switch them on
no no not fair if there switching
this is usually what
happens in the live demo
ed yeah
let me just check if i
have the right address
yeah yeah it emaweni
hmm oh there we go
teachers cheering
singing
ive got four sons who are busy
one of the things that
ive been involved with
is the cub scouts
i take my sons there on a friday night
we get involved teaching
kids how to be independent
and also most importantly
be good citizens
it very important to get children
to consider their
communities and their society
and to be empathetic to other people
to try and make their communities better
to build it up to try
and think civicmindedly
director this is the
thing that i struggle with
so in africa i dont know that it helps
to resolve third world problems
because if you live in a hut
you dont have access to the internet
you dont have access to a phone
do you think that it actually something
that could really
genuinely make a practical
realworld difference here
i tend to think that
cryptocurrencies have potential
to solve real world
problems all over the world
youre not gonna solve all
the problems certainly
even if it just becomes a
global reserve currency
the local currency for a
country becomes less important
where people can trivially
shift from whatever
the local currency is into bitcoin
and then it doesnt matter
what happens to the local currency
now your reliance isnt on the government
to keep the economy stable
because youve got a backup
youve got a fallback
that very powerful and i think that
that something that
could have lasting effects
and impact in africa
weve had this leapfrog thing that occurs
where there an innovation
like digital cellphones
when they came out
those were the first cellphones
that really got deployed in south africa
and because of that we were on g faster
than the united states and most of europe
and it just because the infrastructure
is a little bit more modern
because it was deployed
slightly later in the game
there are a class of problems in africa
where we can just leapfrog
and use cryptocurrencies
to our advantage and i think
that what gonna happen
even though myself
on a daytoday basis
i dont use bitcoin in
the way i would like
i do wanna be able to spend bitcoin
and i do wanna be able
to have people out there
in this country spending bitcoin
i want merchants and service
providers to accept bitcoin
so instead of waiting
for them to do that
im now going and actually
providing those tools
i will certainly strive
to create the opportunity
for people to spend it
in their daytoday lives
and also to accept it in
their daytoday lives
director ironically
the story i expected
was to be told by a bunch of men in suits
just in pursuit of more money
i expected to find
bandits and terrorists
and everydayjoes organizing
dark deeds in dark places
but in the last five and a half years
the story i thought i would be telling
about the crypto space in
africa never materialized
ive realized that my
pessimism at the beginning
of this journey was
actually just misplaced
but regardless that pessimism
has now turned to optimism
not so much because of the
tech but because of the people
who are using it to make the
circle both bigger and better
and that what i call the
beginning of a revolution
lively music
just off the top of my head
