you had to make it about her
they are good boys
they will do rebecca proud
they keep asking where their father is
they dont understand why he isnt here
what did you tell them
well i told them that he
on a very important and sacred mission
that he loves them
and hell be home soon
lemuel is very bright
i could do something with him
we will do
whatever both of them need
we owe it to rebecca and to john
i made john that promise
he understands
i know it bothers you
but you cant protect john
it gone too far
he can never come back
if they have us
they dont need john
he can only bring them trouble now
he damaged goods
you were always better
at making the hard choices
john life will be the price
for those boys future

if you touch one hair on his head
what is going on who is that
the psychopath that works for you
he took the girl so i took your son

you lost a lot of blood
yeah no shit

listen man there a reason im here
and not mount sinai okay
it aint my bedside manner
i do flesh wounds
you know fix up guys
that took a shot to the arm the leg
you know maybe need a few sutures
after a fight gone bad
but you should go to the hospital
theyll lock me back up
here what gonna happen
youre gonna pull out those bullets
and youre gonna close me up
do you understand me
all right all right
and i am not going under
i have to no matter how much
of a badass you think you are
youre gonna flinch and im gonna take
two inches off your liver
i said no
let go
yeah
yeah yeah
this is stupid
get it out
we got one
okay
one
let get this shit out
let go let go
i didnt want any of this
i know the feeling
they didnt deny it any of it
all this time and i i never
how could i not know
how
how could i not sense it
you were their poster boy david
they wanted to keep you clean
plausible deniability
isnt that what the spooks call it
i didnt ask for any deniability
and now people are dead
because of some photographs
it was what was in those photographs
it isnt relevant
it shouldnt be youre right
but some people dont think like that
my parents being some of them
from what i know
no offense
but you got some shitty parents
my mother always said that
we needed to protect people
from their own prejudices
it was the price of getting me
where i wanted to be to do the most good
but now i wonder if maybe
my parents had
all these people murdered
simply because they
they were ashamed of me
didnt want anything about me
hurting their legacy
that all they really cared about
you dont seem like him castle
why are you doing this
holding me hostage
is this you or
who you wanna be
i started out
just wanting to do the right thing
now i just want to go home
yeah
you and me both
curt
yeah
how do we do this
well he here the trailer
you want him you come get him
ah shit
okay frank
jesus christ
youre really planning
on going after him in this state
youre crazy he gonna kill you
yeah maybe
or ill kill him
god will decide which of us is righteous
you honestly believe that
he the punisher
he gonna like righteously pull
your spine out of your throat
what was righteous about all this anyway
what happened to thou shalt not kill
i mean come on you
you murdered people
who never hurt anybody
theyre using you
just because someone says
something is true
doesnt mean that it is
even if you wanna believe them
even if you keep believing them
even if they believe it themselves
in the end you just have to admit that
theyre lying and change your own path
cause people never change
they just hide stuff from you
and let you down
over and over again
plenty of kids learn that at a young age
and so you have to decide
do i stay
or do i change the path for myself
you could still change this
it too late
it doesnt have to be
let me go walk away
i wish i could
i really wish i could
detective
last time i saw you mr hoyle
you had a rifle pointed at my head
im sorry about that

just giving him back

someone else mistakes
and for what it worth officer
i think that curtis is just trying
to find a way to do the right thing
the last few days ive learned nothing is
easy or simple where castle is concerned
i checked you out hoyle
everyone says youre a good guy
so long as you never point a gun
at another cop again
you get a pass
this time
come on senator im taking you home
and curtis i advise you the same
there nothing id rather do more
go ahead and close it

will you come
can you promise me that
that you wont call the cops at least
can you do that
can you do that
i promise i wont call the cops
look i know that i probably
dont deserve it after what ive done
but if you can find it in yourself
to be a brother one last time
i dont want to die alone
i dont want
i dont
did you come here to gloat
no
no im sorry this happened to you
which part
the throwing me out of a window
billy dragging you into this
he didnt drag me into anything
i love him
is he alive
yeah as far as i know
he ran he left you bleeding in the dirt
he was no use to me if he stayed
he knew that
he knew i would have
wanted him to be free
you know you were right kinda
i really did get the therapy
i needed at your place
not the talking so much but when i
finally put three bullets in billy
that really helped my state of mind
you see this blood
it his
you see he is on the street
alone bleeding
now the only question is
whether well find him alive or dead
he wont die
he too strong
and he gonna come for me
when the time is right
he gonna come for me
ill let you know when we find him
hell kill you for what you did to me
oh you did this to yourself
curt
curtis here
i knew youd come and
frankie
you dont look so good
of course it you
i should have known
if im gonna be with somebody im
im happy that it you
frank
whatever ive done im
any chance we can preserve
the crime scene
what part of this isnt clear to you
only who fired the bullets
tell me how it went again
billy called me then i called you
that right because youre done
being involved with frank
mahoney does it really matter
i guess im still not used
to blurring the lines as much as you
was this you
madani
did you finish the job
im flattered really
but you know what yeah maybe
maybe i did
maybe i put five bullets in him
instead of three
and then that the end of the story
case closed
and what about castle
who
son of a bitch
david is strong-willed
he liable to say something stupid
speak out
make some sort of grand gesture
im headed to new york tomorrow
david will listen to me
but youve gotta deal with john
eliza he has done everything
that we have asked of him
weve already talked about this
just someone else
for you to kill and toss aside
move and ill shoot
no one coming
i gave them the night off
maybe i should have just killed them
like you wouldve
what do you want money we can do that
girl move that gun away from my wife
how does it feel
you killed all my friends
i told you
to move the gun away from my wife

i was gonna come in here
with two bullets give you a choice

now it your turn
john said you were dead

so think what well do to you
if you do not let our only child go
you will die slowly
i will kill everyone who so much
as crossed paths with you mr castle
money power

carving it into the world
so deep that it never fades
somehow out of all this bullshit
that son of yours he got decency
he cares about the world about people
he knows right from wrong how is that
give david a chance
at making things right
or else in 24 hours im gonna walk
into the office of the new york bulletin
with this tape and the photographs
and start talking
time for you to make a choice
you take that gun
you stick it in your mouth
you blow out the back of your head
or you live
but you live with the truth
