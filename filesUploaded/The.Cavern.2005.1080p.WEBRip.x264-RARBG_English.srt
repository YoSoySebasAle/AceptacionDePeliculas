every day
he in slow motion
we call her florence
what like nightingale
yeah
why
okay stop
because on her first caving expedition
someone got hurt
so this guy cuts himself
on his knee
oh wait
it wasnt just a cut
no no no youre right
it was a tiny cut
tiny
oh you bitch
but florence here
decides that she was
going to wrap it
and wrapped it and yes
you may have guessed it
she wrapped it again
you bitch
but seriously
id love to lead my own cave expedition
of children
of grown-ups
be the first to explore
a new cave
itd be amazing
certainly have a lot more
fun than those guys
especially gannon
how long has it been
two years tomorrow
yeah that what changed him
what do you mean
what happened
it--it wont go in the book
if i tell you
youre gonna wanna put it in
it wont
youve got my word
do you guys know
no
we meet gannon today
all right ori
you can trust me
two years ago
we were caving in peru
me miranda
bailey domingo gannon
there were some
other guys there
but they dont
work for us anymore
and there was
another woman rachel
his fiancée
it was the beginning
of the rainy season in peru
and we were trying to get out
of a cave that was flooding
and she didnt make it
we were all you know
really close to her
im sorry
yeah gannon was the only one
that saw her die
her body was never found
are you saying
there more to the story
no
then what are you saying
nothing
that it
well im gonna go to bed
me too
get some sleep
so
you guys thinking
about tomorrow
you getting what you need
for your book
yeah yeah i am
caving is a whole new world
for a lot of people i mean
i mean you know
you show them a photo
it opens them up to
a whole new universe right
every photo you sell
furthers caving
yeah
were lucky to be
making a living doing it
so so what are
your thoughts exactly
on caving
what do you mean
i mean
what your philosophy
how do you approach it
i wanna know what makes you go down there
there something
about caves that alive
there something down there that
if were open to it
we can connect with
i look for that connection
every time i go down
i crave it
youre a brujo
his father was
so you believe in spirits
like spirit of the earth
spirit of the sun
yeah i do
and cave spirits
the most unpredictable of all
interesting
everyone has
their own beliefs
what hanging
from your neck
it a cross
if something as magnificent
or as terrible as god
is possible
anything is right
right
yeah but i wasnt saying
throughout history
caves have been a sacred place
for almost every religion
in existence
remember jesus was buried
and resurrected in a cave
im sorry
i wasnt trying to offend you
so why do you do it
we havent found them all
everyone knows where
the highest mountains are
the deepest seas
but caves
caves are the last unexplored frontier on earth
there nothing more
exciting than that
my grandfather used
to climb through caves
to find new mining lines
on the east coast
hed say
apollo had it easy
cause everyone knows
where the moon is
but no one knows
where im going
so are there any events
or anything about
caving that you regret
over the years ive found
that it hard to control
what happens down there
it a beast and not
all beasts can be tamed
and that what
you need to understand
things happen in caves that dont happen anywhere else
when youre down there
youre in darkness
an eternal
never-ending world of night
down there miles beneath
the earth surface
youre surrounded
by miles of rock
you know a wrong step
can send you down a chasm
hundreds of feet deep
and if you get
hurt down there
maybe break an arm
or break a leg
there no ambulance nearby
no hospital
chances are you wont be
brought out alive
the only way to survive it over and over is to respect it
respect where you are
respect what it is
bailey bailey
hold on im coming
is everyone asleep
