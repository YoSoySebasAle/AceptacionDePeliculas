it should be great seeing him
after three years
yeah i
couldnt believe how fast
he split for africa
after he got his grants
and the zoo let him take
the little cubs he raised
youd think hed
take the kids he raised
well he
was going to send for us
but he said it
was too dangerous
he certainly didnt leave
because he didnt love us
and you know how
depressed he used to get
with his cats kept in
cages all the time
i wonder where he is
why dont we try to
find our own way there
youre joking
where could he be
boy you guys wait til my
family gets here tonight
are they gonna love you
oops sorry hank
and i thought you
came to help me

i came to speak for you
with that committee
and take you to
pick up your family

the gentle and
the ferocious too
be careful of the bad
and enjoy the good
you arent careful enough
well for my
studies i have to get
as close to them as possible
you know actually the
closer you get to them
the more theyd like you
and the safer youd be
but look he
going to jump on us
no no no no
theyre just playing
they like to play the
old cat and mouse game

cat in the world
and he also the top cat here
yeah he the boss
i work for him
hey rob
well come here i want
you to meet mativo
see actually it robby
im worried about
their whole life is
based on dominance
that why we have such
a great harmony here
because robbie is such a
gentle and loving ruler
he also knows he has to protect
the others from outsiders
right now he very
worried about togar
he also worried that if the
others see that he worried
or afraid that then theyll
start challenging him
like theyve been
each other all day
no matter how afraid
he is at this moment
he still knows he has
to see this through
the whole meaning of his
life is before him mativo
that why you have to help me
i have to what why
because i have to
help him mativo
and he could get killed
dont worry im gonna help ya
i dont think you
should count on me
but only yesterday
they were so happy
now look at them
finally on the verge
of finding paradise
and the only thing
lacking is my family
to share it with me
and togar comes in wrecking it
here comes trouble
it a grand committee
but prentiss is with them
listen my friend let me talk
good morning everybody
i would like to
open this meeting
by reminding you all that
hank original idea
was a comparative study
of the great cats of the wild
and while observing
the african cats
in their natural habitat
he will raise several cats
of each species
be they african or otherwise
and to become almost like
a member of the pride
hey it has stripes it must
be another tigon or a liger
the mother a lioness
the father must be a tiger
say hello to henry
the jaguar would ya
not today
what are you trying to prove
that you can have lions
socializing with people
no but we cant keep
exterminating them
we cant keep
eliminating their land
we cant keep
exterminating everything
that we fear or that
inconveniences us
let the zoos keep them alive
prentiss your actions
arent necessary
the government knows
there a better way
theyre moving the people out of
the migration paths
i dont know what kind of person
could look in the
eyes of 200 elephants
and put out those lights
they run frantically in panic
trying to protect
their children--
do you think your lions
would run and panic
you better start with me first
no ill start with
the tigers first
thatll teach you for
bringing them to africa
i gotta go help your uncles;
theyre killing each other
stop it stop it hey hey
calm down
togar
togar togar
you stay out of it you let
robbie take care of him
yeah you guys are smart;
you stayed out of it
oh craig hi tommy jimmy
oh aw you hide in here
i dont blame you all
those guys are fighting
over the
side this way git
that my jacket
help
hank
hank get out here
hank hank
hank get out here
get him off me
run
woah hey
come on go in the house
and get some bandages
oh what the hell
wrong with you
all you got a few scratches
youre lucky togar
didnt getcha
i think you should take our bus
it goes right by there
oh no well i
think we should wait
no; if you wait until
tonight and it doesnt come
there is no other
bus for two days
and there is no place
for you to stay here
well whatll we do
will he know where to take us
oh come on ill
tell him for you
hey she dry
alice has no milk
listen i have to go change
ill go back to my boat
okay
maybe ill come with you
if he claws ya--
what do i do now
just stand up to
them dont let them
get away with anything
you gotta let em see
how strong you are
come on lions we have to
clean the house for madelaine
come on lions
come on lions
come on diane come on michael
come on patrick
are you sure there arent
any more big ones in here
well hello gary
why didnt you go with your--
why didnt you go
with your friends
come on you should
go with your friends
aw come on
you really changed this place
new curtains new
drapes new everything
come on go with your friends
come on oh yes
you have to go
with your friends
come on
come on
aw dont worry davie
robbie can handle togar
your father tougher
than you think
come on
oh come on youll hurt my hand
see i got a hand hurt
come on come on davie
i think i drove togar as
far away as 200 miles
this is the first
time he come in
i have a hunch that
robbie and togar
could be brothers
you know bugsy and robbie
were both rogue lions
i found them dying
from battle wounds
now if togar were sick or dying
these guysd
probably accept him
but the way he is now --
vicious alright
well he cant help that
as a loner he too slow to
catch his normal dinners
and the hungrier he gets
the more desperate he gets
the more desperate he gets
the more ferocious he gets
because the only way he
can eat most of the time
is by taking his meals
from whole prides of lions
you gotta be pretty
ferocious to do that
sooner or later he
gonna get killed
come on gary
billy
hey dont try to frighten me
leave that alone
that my jacket
hey hank come and help me
