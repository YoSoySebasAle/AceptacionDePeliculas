yeah
what
already
that too far ahead of schedule
jesus
yeah ill be right there
yeah im coming right now
laura
laura
what
we got to get to the base
something happened
everything okay
something serious
just meet me in the car in
5 minutes ill get tina
okay
dad what going on
hi baby
5 minutes meet me in the car
did you see what happening outside
what should we do
just stay calm i need you to pack an
overnight bag were going to the base
how long are we to be gone
not long
so i dont pack that much
i dont know baby
just get what you can and maybe
we come back for the rest
but i got to get to the
base as soon as possible
i want you there
with me okay
okay
come on laura
let go
what kelvin’s eta
somebody give me an answer asap
ive got a force launch going in the space
loaded with nukes way ahead of schedule
why is he not in here
his locator shows him
nearly 60 miles of-site
get an escort and get it to him now
yes sir
sir that blast came out of nowhere
another one like that might take
our launch systems off-line
recommendations
well the faster it gets up there
the sooner it comes down and gets reloaded
commence countdown
copy that countdown commenced
5 4 3 2
go
rockets firing
and we now lift off
the rocket is up sir
now get him in here
ryan can you slow down
i guess i shouldnt even bother asking
why were going to the base
i just cant laura
if you found out why then
i wouldnt be doing my job
thanks baby
that very reassuring
you are unbelievable
unbelievable
is that one of yours
go go
oh my god
are you kidding me right now
who was that why would people be after us
im not sure
not sure cause you dont know
or youre not sure
because it another
stupid government cover-up
im not sure because
i really dont know
and i really dont want to find out
with the two of you in the car
everybody hold on
i think they shot the tires
what
oh my god
we gonna have to make a run for it
run
come on
go
go
go back
it a dead end
it a dead end
now everybody get out
go go
come on
go go
hurry
dr kelvin
what are you doing with nuclear weapons
dr kelvin
what is he talking about
what
in the last year
you have made 7 trips
to the international space station
armed with bombs
why
okay
you gotta run okay
were all in danger the whole world
yes by your actions
mr kelvin
professor kelvin
there is one more
henreaux
henreaux
what took you so long
we got here as quick as we could sir
dont worry mrs kelvin
i have agents taking care of you and your
daughter before this project is finished
ill make all the arrangements myself
get them to the base
theyll be safe there
yes sir
i cant believe we were in danger
and you didnt tell us
i didnt know
honestly
nobody outside the project
was supposed to know anything
well baby obviously somebody found out
i just
i just
how long
tell me when it gonna be over
and when were gonna be safe
a month
one month
one way or another
itll all be over i promise
okay
mam
i am agent green
this is my partner agent dunne
we have a car waiting
okay
mam’
sir
catch ya
my wife my daughter myself
whatever these guys found out from my side
would have killed us afterwards
you know it one thing for
me to put my life on the line
whoever inside the project leaked the
information out well plug the leak
well please do it before it gets more out
of hand before it gets out to the public
before it causes worldwide panic
professor kelvin
capt james moto air force office of
special investigations
hi
ive been assigned to go through your
computer systems
emails im blog posts you know
anything containing information ways
you know enough about the project
to know what youre looking for
well yeah i know that the
small burst of radiation
that have been hitting planet earth
the past couple of years
is supposed to be prelude to a full
blast supernova that coming in over us
not supposed to be about it
based on analysis weve been
getting the spitzer space telescope
there gonna be enough gamma radiation
for a planet-killing catastrophe
i need to go check on the space platform
the climate will go haywire
everything controlled by
electricity will be fried
communications water and you name it
the earth will turn into
a radioactive wasteland
that how long we have
until the blast hits us
and there is nothing that can
be done to stop it
that what this project is all about
another hand to help us
with our calculations
capt moto professor huan ye of china
the people republic of china
professor dzerzhinsky of russia
the people republic of vodka
ye and i have been going over the
calculations for nuclear missile launches
and i think that we will have to alter
each launch by a few milliseconds
in order for pattern to sustain cloud
we have to re-program the us missile
launch codes in order to
match the timing of ours
or you could just let us do it
im sure my government would be about
as happy about that as yours would
message me the new codes
what a shame
with so much at stake youd think we could
make decisions that
would benefit our own mutual interest
perhaps it in all our mutual
interest that we study all the data
and make our decision based on that
touché
i dont care
i just hope that when
we launch those nukes
that the cloud shield will protect the earth
as much as possible
magnetosphere is earth natural barrier
against radiation
but our data show that the
incoming radiation would be too strong
for the magnetosphere to handle so
were gonna help mother nature out
there are two schools of thought
on where to explode the nukes
inside the magnetosphere
and outside the magnetosphere
honestly unless we cant
get more nukes up there
neither of these plans are gonna cut it
let me ask you a question
you trust these guys
i have to
were all gonna be up on that space platform
together controlling the missile launches
i wish we could launch them from down here
but
without the earth
gravitational pull we can
pinpoint the launches right
where we want them and
and detonate them more quickly
what happens if one the bursts
fries the platform electronics
well
weve had them retro-fitted
with radiation shield
like we did on the space shuttle so
let’s hope that doesnt happen
where is it
mrs kelvin
tina are you sure you havent seen it
i thought you had it last
i cant remember
mrs kelvin
it gotta be here somewhere
ms kelvin
what
im not leaving here without
her mom necklace okay
mrs kelvin
what
we did you the courtesy
of coming back here
we are on a tight timetable and
we need to escort you to base
now
0 more minutes
and were leaving
your father told me he hid it in some
stupid hiding place that only he knows
you know you really need
to cut him some slack
he has some pretty big
things on his mind
youre right
will you help me look
and there you go my man gin
oh come on
you know youll need male
equipments to be an astronaut
funny funny funny
okay theyre loading the nuclear
warhead on the shuttle now
this is it
the last one
let us do our part
to save the world again
let me see
for the nuclear cloud shield
to be strong enough to last this
the entire supernova burst
we should have more
warheads that we thought
youre right
i wish that we had more
but given the time constraint
that we have and
the fact that we only have 3 shuttles
to carry everything to the platform i
yes
yes
i just wish we had
one more load of
of nuclear warheads
up there
because at this point
every shuttle especially this last one
will make a difference as to whether
our little nuclear shield will
protect the whole earth or not
look i know
but were just gonna do the best with
what weve got and hope that it works
a massive earthquake has triggered
an infamous volcano
in italy back into activity
now two thousand years later mount
vesuvius has reared its head once again
burying hundreds of square
kilometers in ash and pumice
guess what i found
thanks
what wrong sweetie
are you kidding me
we almost got murdered this morning
and now we are supposed to
get in the car and go right back into it
i know i just
i dont know what else to do
why cant he just stay here with us
why cant he just be here
sweetheart it just
like you said it just
he got a lot on his plate right now
shed know what to do
yeah
i know she would
when is it gonna stop
let just hold on
let go
let go
come on get the two let get out of here
come on
from here on out
stronger energy bursts are
going to hit earth and
and worse it will beget
the shuttle
please tell me the platform
is intact
im sorry dr kelvin but im not
sure were gonna be able to launch it
there could be problems
launch structure now
we dont have any other choice
those warheads have to
get up on the platform
or parts of the earth are gonna go
unprotected and destroyed by radiation
okay ill have the structure
gone over again but
i know i know
everyone is aware of the risk
please do it
ill find out when the
after-shocks are gonna hit so
we can schedule the
next launch
alright good thanks i
i gotta take
care of something else now
ryan
thank god
yeah we are okay
the house was destroyed in the
earthquake
no no were okay
yeah we are on our way there now
agents are right in front of us
they are keeping an eye on us
good good just
do what they tell you and
everything will be alright
okay i will
i love you too
brace yourself
look out
the tremors feel like they
is it over
i think so
laura
ryan
what happened laura
ryan
ryan
ryan
i can hardly hear you
oh my god
professor kelvin
im sorry what
the next after-shock wont hit for hours
i spoke with nasa
and they okayed the launch structure so
theyre gonna go ahead as scheduled
good
let’s pray nothing else happens
between now and then
sir
what is it
were picking up a major
surge in energy particles
about to reach the earth atmosphere
that almost four hours
ahead of our calculations
we have to get a hold of
launch control and see if
there any way we could
stop them from launching
if the shipments of warheads
doesnt make it up there
we wont have enough to protect
us against the full supernova burst
it not much we can do about it now
the launch is a go in 3
mission control
mission control can you read me
mission control please respond
that flight had to happen
we needed those warheads
we have to re-compute
the missile launch pattern
now that we dont have as many
as we need
let get an uplink
ill run a full diagnostic to see if
there any damage on the platform
that is if the energy
burst will let us through
i will re-check energy burst
to try to figure out
why we were so far off in calculating speed
dr kelvin
what
based on our newest data
that we are getting now our
our calculations on
when the supernova will arrive
are off by more than 24 hours
jesus
but that could change
it could get shorter if the
stronger blast that comes right before the
supernova is moving faster than we think
and i think we should take another look
at where we are going to do the explosions
inside or outside magnetosphere
you know my feelings on this and
the reason i believe we need
to create the shield outside it
yes but i just did a
new computer simulation of
the nuclear explosions with fewer warheads
and molecules will stay more
tightly bound together
if the explosions occur
inside the magnetosphere
not outside it wont
be as effective
and if we explode the warheads
inside the magnetosphere
we run the chance of destroying
the earth atmosphere
changing the climate and destroying
this planet as we know it
oh please
i think we need to concentrate
on the immediate threat
the supernova
we cant just trade off one form of
the earth being destroyed for another
that only if we accept your theory
you do not know what will
happen anymore than i do
got a second
ive been running through all
the internet traffic
in and out here for the
past couple of days
i found that someone sent out a message
to a blind email account
professor ryan kelvin is
the one in charge of
putting nuclear weapons into
space for the us government
it no wonder that the iranians came after
me any idea who signed in to this computer
you did
or someone using
your name and password
look somebody’s being smart
is there any way that i when i
my username signs in to use a program
that we attach a voice id and a password
sure no problem
take care of yourself
oh
one oth i mean if you can
ive been trying to get a hold of my wife
all day and it just nothing but static
i can use a signal booster and
see if that will do the trick
thanks cause im just
with the earthquake i
dont worry about it
im on it right now
okay
it stuck
the links are probably down
just an after-shock
hello
got it
laura
thank god ive been trying
get through to you
the agents were killed
in the earthquake
where are you
youre still on your way right
were trying to get
to the air base but
the bridge is blocked so
we cant get through
you okay
are you sure
yeah im worried ive been
trying to get a hold of you
maybe you shouldnt try to meet me here
i dont know what to do
we cant keep driving
no what i was thinking is
maybe youd meet me at patterson
there is an underground secure
facility there it where all the
shuttle launch computers are
where all the nasa higher-ups are going
because we had it special radiation treated
meet me at the fall out okay
so
we heard on the news about
the supernova that true
yes
me not talking to you the last few years
i couldnt
there something else i want to talk to
you about but not on the phone okay
meet me at the fallout shelter
okay hum
tell them to expect us okay
baby i love you
i love you too
when they get to the gates
theyre gonna use his name
what i want you to do is assign them a
secure living quarter until he gets there
youre a good man
i got it setup now so any time your
password logs onto a computer
somebody gonna need to
register a voice command
before the computer does anything
one less thing to worry about
laura look out
who taught you how to drive
the heat is really climbing
i cant believe that
storm caught up to us
get in let get outta here
it keeps getting closer
i know
ive never seen clouds
move so fast
look out
laura
okay dont touch anything any metal
will be electrified
it okay
i think well be alright
the cab like a faraday cage
thank god the windows are rolled up
the electricity will find a
way to the ground in a second
you are your father’s daughter arent you
the faraday cage isnt enclosed anymore
it means
that electricity can get us now
alright uh
maybe we can get a ride
get out
now
we have to get away from the car
it will attract the lightning
alright go there
go
stay away from trees
they attract lightning the most
remind me to thank your father
oh god
even if the lightning doesnt get us
one of those feelers still could
were gonna be okay
were gonna be okay
oh god laura
come on
great the launch computers on
the platforms are not responding
we cant get through to them
i can communicate with other systems
onboard just not those
it a good thing we have
back-ups that is functioning right
dont we
ill go over it to make
sure that it is
but it has to gonna come onboard
with us on the shuttle
wait it needs to be
programmed with the latest data
and you have to run
that test-fire simulation
to make sure of its launch capabilities
the speed of the energy burst
is increasingly hitting us
means that the launch computer
will have to reconfigure
time space and location
of missile launches
and destination second by second
we are almost just guessing how
fast the supernova is really moving
until it is right about to hit us
moto
im gonna be down at a-3
do me a favor will you
keep trying to get a hold of my wife
kelvin ryan project head
are all the electric power turned
on to the platform mark-up
yes sir
i heard that you had
a problem
it kind of makes me wonder if god
wants us interfering with his plans
right now i wonder how the grapevine
around here knows about mine
okay
come on baby i dont
need any more problems now
let check the control panel
great at least the
emergency system works
kelvin
kelvin
kelvin
fuck
kelvin it me henreaux
come on sit down
you okay
you got any idea
who attacked you
no just
what they were after just
someone dressed in black and kicked
my ass in a real professional way
how long was i out
20 minutes maybe
if someone wanted to sabotage this project
they could have destroyed
this with the replacing panel
or they just wanted
to get rid of you
it gotta be someone
inside this project
but after what
there been no unauthorized access
but im cross-checking the
password and log-in now
where motto
he dead
he came looking for you with a message but
he ran into your man in black instead
jesus
dead
it is desperate
do whatever you can
yes
goodbye
where is ye
did the simulation work
you both been here the
whole time since i left
i was gone a few minutes to
pick up some sandwiches but
why didnt moto find you
you saw moto
he was here
he was looking for you he said
your wife called and that
she needed your help
desperately
time is growing shorter
it looks like the lightning stopped
for right now
how are we gonna get to the base
howdy
you all get lost
all em fire is burning
because of the heat and lightning
hey do you happen to have a phone
we can use
sure do
if it still working
this heat
the two of you must be pretty desperate
to get somewhere to be out in this on foot
we had a car
but the storm
were trying to get to my dad
before he takes off on the space shuttle
he working on that big project
ryan
laura
where are you
why havent you gotten to patterson yet
what
listen were
were okay for right now but
i dont know if were gonna
make it to patterson
im coming to get you guys
no
baby you cant leave
project now
look i have to see you
baby i want to see you too
more than anything but
listen i know that you have
to do what youre doing
okay you have a job to do and
there too much at stake for
you should leave now
i cant leave you out
there unprotected laura
somehow well
well be fine
really
you know that cave that we
went exploring out during our vacation
well go in there
therell be protection
well be fine
honey
i havent told you my part
it up on the space platform
launching the missiles
if any part of the supernova burst
makes it trough the platform it wont
look honey if i havent
told you enough lately or
if you ever doubted
i know baby
i know
i just want you to know
that i love you so much
hi dad
hey kiddo
hey uh
if you guys cant make it to
the base in the next couple of hours
i need you to find
some deep cover okay
a mine shaft or a cave or something
understand
yeah i will
i will
i will do what can
but i need you and laura
to find a safe spot okay
dad
you know if you want to get to that cave
it not gonna be a good idea for
you to try it out on foot
that old truck of mine aint much but
but it ought to get you there okay
what about you
come with us youre not
gonna be safe here
where am i gonna go
ive lived here my whole life
ill die here
so this is the truck i was
telling you guys about
thank you so much
no need
glad to help
i was having a second idea here
im thinking maybe only one
of you should go
i think maybe she should stay
excuse me
there no reason for
both of you to go really
and id like for her to stay
besides for the weather the way it is
who knows if we even have tomorrow
so what do you say
i think maybe you and i could
really get to know each other
ill call you back
things bad or worse than expected
i just faced my own mortality a
little quicker that i wanted to
im not too
happy about that
how are you feeling physically
look i feel like atlas
with the world on my shoulders
only that the world is crushing me
i want the leak
i want whoever killed moto found
alright sweep the place
bugs taps on my computer everything
yes sir
right away
we lost more time huh
based on the speed of this latest bursts
that our new time
at this rate we will have to
make launch to space platform
more quicker than i thought
a lot more quicker
then i better finish the simulation
on that replacement panel
you trying to test em
when im in the platform mock-up
i want remote surveillance
no security actually inside the hangar
so if someone wants to come after me
and find something out that fine
we need to find out who they are
and what they want as soon as possible
were running out of time
kelvin ryan project head
it like the apocalypse is coming
wow what happening
the gust keep picking up
it like flying into a head wind
how much longer til we get
to this cave were going to
we should be there by morning
i hope it not that way
oh my god
if we cant get off here
well have to turn around
look out
i see it
maybe we should do
what theyre doing and
go back
we cant go back that way well be trapped
okay but do you see a cutoff or anything
look around
im looking im looking
there i can see
god
were not gonna make it
were gonna make it
put your head down
let get outta here
let go
come on
no attacker
well were not gonna
get another chance
we got the word to move you to
the shuttle launch site in one hour
it the atmosphere
it getting more unstable by the hour
so if we dont go up now
we might not make it to the platform
any luck on getting a hold
on my wife and daughter
sorry too much
interference
alright youd better pack up the
computer replacement panel
im gonna have a word
with dzerzhinsky and ye
hey buddy you okay
yeah
youre gonna be fine
that was a hell of an earthquake
bring a medical team down here right away
roger that
somebody gonna be here
just be calm
doc you can you
give me a hand
yeah let me put this case down
ill be right back
kelvin ryan project head
are you alright
where is dzerzhinsky
in the control room weve been
getting ready to leave
great
all those satellites giving
us data are gone
the only place to measure
speed of supernova is platform
hurry up; we gotta get ready to go
there is no telling how
short time we have
until the boom
have you been here the whole time
yes i tried to get signal trough
to the platform but could not
for all i know it might not be working
wonderful
weve got problems
more
that earthquake was centered
30 km off the coast
it may have destroyed
the shuttle platform
let us finish get packed up just
get us some transportation
right away
you okay
we did it
let go kiddo
not beaten yet
you think you can fix this
well see there only so
much that can go wrong with
an internal combustion engine
will you go in the back
and see if there a
a screwdriver or something
careful careful
try it again
try again
go ahead and try
one more time
nice
ive already told you
there no way we can do it
the launch is scrapped
but the shuttle is on the launch pad
it could be launched and weve got
no other choice except to try
that just the problem
it cant be launched
the electromagnetic storm have wrecked
irrevocable havoc on all our systems
so it the control panel
gone nothing working
you still got power dont you
well the emergency generator system
alright then hook it
directly to the shuttle
create a makeshift control panel
and get ready to do it manually
you gotta be kidding
you know how many variables are
involved with the rocket firing sequence
just keeping them stabilized
is difficult enough
you people have fired off enough shuttles
by now to be able to do it in your sleep
take the training wheels
off and do it manually
is it possible
the earthquake could have damaged
the launch structure too
i mean i dont know
it scares the shit outta me too
but either way
if we dont go up there were gonna die
anyone else have a better idea
still believe in the
hand of god dzerzhinsky
god’s great hand
sweeping across the
universe to destroy all of mankind
why dont you just
let me enjoy cigarette
before i go blow myself
up in that machine
all lines are busy
if they cant complete this soon
then it doesnt matter anyway
she is very correct
just using
acceleration factor of burst
so far is baseline
i would have to say
that we have only about
eight hours till
supernova burst
it too bad our people republic
space program wasnt further along
because we would have
planned this much better
for us to not have
problems like this
you may have had
better planning but
you would still need russian
engineering in order to do better
as long as were talking about planning
id like to reexamine
where were going to
explode the warheads
that has already been decided
it already been decided based on numbers
the electromagnetic and
molecular interaction
but not in how the
magnetosphere works
we already know what you think about
how it will affect the earth
im not talking about climate effects
im talking about the best
way to use it as a shield
look
we have two shields
against the supernova burst
the magnetosphere
and the nuclear cloud shield
based on molecular interaction
with constant warheads explosions
the nuclear cloud
will defiantly be the
stronger of the two
against the supernova
gamma radiation
and i agree
based on the numbers it will hold
together a little more strongly
if we position it inside
the magnetosphere
okay but how the
magnetosphere works
its self-sustaining
it can take smaller energy bursts
and to recover quickly
which means
with the cloud shield outside of it
then the magnetosphere will act as
a constant second shield
to catch the radiation the
cloud shield misses
but if the magnetosphere takes
the full burst of the supernova first
disrupting its flow
it wont be able to regenerate
and all that will be left
is the one shield the cloud shield
to protect the earth
this is what important
the strength of the cloud shield
the numbers supports it
the scientific community agrees
i dont think we should
change things now
even if we wanted to
there no time to program the
new sequences into
the launch computer
i still have
no
we are sticking with the plan
are you ready
no
but that not gonna stop us
alright
if you really wanna do this
get your gear
all systems
it powered up
check
cabin pressure
020 psi
exterior air temperature 34 degrees
were not supposed to launch
if it over 99
seeing how we dont even know if the
platform up there
so that the least of our worries
were all set
okay commence countdown
im proud to stand along with you
on this new battlefield
an arena we have
never encountered
we sit on the brink
of annihilating
and i speak to you now
not just as your president
but as a fellow citizen of
united states and the entire world
by now you all know the ensuing
supernova and the consequences it may bring
it is an event this world
will not soon forget
let our hearts and
our minds guide us
but not let them limit or consume
us with greed and selfpreservation
but let us instead become infected with
goodwill and love toward our fellowman
let this be our finest hour
if it is to be our last
remember hope
remember your loved ones
and those who came before us
remember the legacy and what
they have given us
and if it be god will
may he preserve us all
rocket booster de-tatch
our trajectory is off by 2 degrees
without nasa control guiding us
im pretty amazed were doing this good
we are at the edge of the shield
the ship can make it
it coming apart
what what are you doing
increasing the thrust as it
get us through the ionosphere
electric storm is not good
it getting worse
another charge
i found the receiver
the space platform
it
what is it
we ran out of gas
alright
let see if we
can get some
hey we ran out of gas
can you help us out
there is no escaping this is there
were all gonna die
stop it
stop it
listen to me
we can make it
we can we have a really good chance
of surviving
but if we gonna do that
we need to do it together okay
i need you to be strong and i need
your help you can do that
you can do that right
yes
okay
you have to make the adjustments
on the replacement panel
time before energy
burst hitting us
tells me we only have 28 minutes before
you know
how long
28 minutes
let’s hope this place
has 28 minutes left
the panel is fried
but there still juice
we got 27 minutes
okay i think i got it
go ahead program the launch codes
while i get my laptop up and running
section b is not just breeched
it gone
i got it closed down
but no telling which one is next
hurry
okay
the sequence couplings are frozen
the missiles arent gonna deploy
unless i do manually
i think i got it
initiate the firing sequence
dzerzhinsky
dzerzhinsky
come on
dzerzhinsky
youll never change
launch sequence
all i need is your eyeball

mrs kelvin
i had to come myself
there is someone
you have to talk to
hello
ryan
ryan
yeah i can hear you
supernova
an exploded star
the genesis of life itself on
a collision course with our planet
dzerzhinsky once told me it
was like god great hands
sweeping across the universe
intenting to destroying all mankind
a cosmic broom meant to clear
the way for something new
god will or not
it came from deep in space
and felt terror
and isolation of being alone
what does man do when its
back is against the wall
ye tried to change the codes to
protect the eastern hemisphere more heavily
helping to ensure the
perseveration of her people
thinking back it hard
to blame anyone for that
when i returned to a hero welcome
i said that ye and dzerzhinsky died
saving not only my life
but the lives of billions
we weren’t prepared
we didnt see it coming
but we found a way
the nuclear shield held
but not without its own consequences
the world has changed
but were still here
and stronger for it
when all the pretents melts away
youre finally able to hold on
to what important
