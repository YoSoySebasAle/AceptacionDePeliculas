myself when ive the time
he was a good artist
nothing very bohemian
society portraits
and houses horses
you know
that sort of thing
he--he was
painting a duchess
the evening he died

have found
anything odd
in that
ha but you did

ill for years
oh im sorry
your mother
oh she ran off
when i was a child
i couldnt even
describe her heh
on your own then
youre inquisitive
major
well does it matter
my father taught me
it better to observe
than to be observed
in your case that
a wasteful philosophy
never trust
flattery
you should try
youre not a bad sort
miss bentley
well that a compliment
i can understand
we ought to keep
an eye on the tide
it three o’clock
the steamer leaves
at ten to four
well we dont want
to get too late
it the last one
hands and the ears
the bane
of father life
he could never
get them right
you can tell so much
about someone
by their ears
yes mine
for instance--
red
ha ha ha
only when youre angry
but theyre really
very nice
ahh
i think we ought
to be getting back

miss bentley
i dont give a heck
oh hello
how was the expedition
we went down
to the village market
for this
that and the other
we wouldve asked you
to join us of course
but you werent
at breakfast
i overslept
im afraid
you were
ever so thoughtful
to send
those flowers
i think i shouldve
sent some to you
i lose my sense of humor
sometimes
ha
well i shall miss this place
well not for
a while yet i hope
yes yes
im off in the morning
but you--youve
only just arrived
besides you fit in
so well here heh
well it very kind
of you to say so
but it all arranged
im afraid
then unarrange it
life not that simple
miss bentley
would that it were
i tell you what though
as a peace offering
would you do me
the great honor
of dining with me
tonight

buona sera
miss bentley
ciao
come on
ahhhhhh
youll like it
penny
shilling then
heh so you will
leave tomorrow
im afraid so
work beckons
and all that
but im not sure
that the business
doesnt run itself better
when im away
perhaps you like to feel
youre needed
well it only recently
that ive allowed myself
to leave it at all
cant you stay
a little longer
no ive made my plans
and i must
stick to them
dont um
dont you have any reason
for going back
to england
none whatsoever
tell me
were you never married
no uh yes
i wouldve been
but he already had
a wife
fourteen years
that went on
became such a habit
that when she died
well i suppose
he couldnt face--
anyway i never
saw him again
were you
ever married
before the war i was
engaged to be married
but by the time
it was all over
that had changed
one lost a lot of friends
in the war
and uh
i found it hard
to make attachments
after that
it seems weve both
been unlucky in love
mm
perhaps we should stick
to tennis
major
your carriage awaits
good gracious me
what on earth going on
oh i couldnt let
my friend go in a taxi
no no no no no
ha ha
today it will be
my pleasure
to take you
to the station myself
why that terribly
kind of you
quite sure
it a long way
you will be doing me
a favor
my family this morning
are going to the lido
which you know
i do not enjoy
uh miss bentley
do you like to come with us
to say cheerio

you and i have wild
unconquerable desires
yes but one that stops you
dead in your tracks
like a voice

that life has
a predetermined pattern

now that youre back
wont you be missed
no not really
i have my own business
you see
industrial engineering
light metal and so forth
no it more or less
runs itself nowadays

long time ago
so perhaps you should
stay a whole month
at least until another
impulse strikes you
well

to see me
that trick
already in danger
of becoming stale

one of us disappear
coming in

nothing like that
i can assure you
your major
he would be very angry
if he thought

he would be jealous
would you be
so interested in him
if this girl is not there

and then they seal it up
put it back in the envelope
but for the trick
to work
i really need
to know now
what it is that
you are going to write
well that sounds
awfully like cheating
well just think of it
as a game--
something
for the children
those little monsters
well all right

please
just say the first thing
that comes into your head
spring
in the mountains

this is
the bbc world service
from london
the time is six o’clock
today
winston churchill mp
had a private meeting
with von ribbentrop
the foreign minister
of germany
to discuss a case for
an anglo-german alliance
in which germany
would stand guard
for the british empire
in exchange
germany requested
the return
of her colonies
and that britain
grant her a free hand
in eastern europe
it was clearly indicated
by churchill
that the british government
would not concede
to such terms
great britain would never
disinterest herself
in the fortunes
of the continent
to an extent
which would enable germany
to gain domination
of central and eastern europe
von ribbentrop replied
the fuhrer is resolved
that nothing will stop him
and that war
is inevitable
may i join you
yes
that looks rather good
ill have one of those
too please
you go ahead please
the sun really quite warm
when you consider
that it only may
mmm
yes it really been
exceptionally warm
all month
yes ive heard even
the italians say
it has been
exceptionally warm
it awfully
quiet here
without
the bonizzonis
mm yes very cheerful
werent they
mmm
you were saying
no i was
only going to say
you seem to have
got up rather early
were you thinking
of going for a swim
no i was thinking of going
up into the mountains again
apparently there a bus
that takes you
most of the way
dont suppose
youd care to come
i really ought
to do my packing
well it shouldnt
take too long
we could be back
by three o’clock
oh i cant
ive simply got
too much to do
well youve got until tomorrow
what time your train
well and then
there another thing
i really ought to get
my sleeper ticket
