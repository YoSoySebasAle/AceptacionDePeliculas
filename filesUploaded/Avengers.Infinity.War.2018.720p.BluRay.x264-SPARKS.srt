
this is the asgardian
refugee vessel statesman
we are under assault
i repeat we are under assault
the engines are dead
life support failing
requesting aid
from any vessel within range
we are 22 jump points out of asgard
our crew is made up
of asgardian families
we have very few soldiers here
this is not a warcraft
i repeat this is not a warcraft
hear me and rejoice
you have had the privilege
of being saved by the great titan
you may think this is suffering
no
it is salvation
universal scales tip toward balance
because of your sacrifice
smile
or even in death
you have become children of thanos
i know what it like to lose
to feel so desperately
that youre right
yet to fail
nonetheless
it frightening
turns the legs to jelly
but i ask you to what end
dread it
run from it
destiny arrives all the same
and now it here
or should i say
i am
you talk too much
the tesseract
or your brother head
i assume you have a preference
i do
kill away
alright stop
we dont have the tesseract
it was destroyed on asgard
you really are the worst brother
i assure you brother
the sun will shine on us again
your optimism is misplaced
asgardian
well for one thing
im not asgardian
and for another
we have a hulk
let him have his fun
allfathers
let the dark magic flow
through me one last
time
that was a mistake
no
youre going to die for that
my humble personage
bows before your grandeur
no other being
has ever had the might
nay the nobility
to wield not one
but two infinity stones
the universe
lies within your grasp
there are two more stones on earth
find them my children
and bring them to me on titan
father we will not fail you
if i might
interject
if youre going to earth
you might want a guide
i do have a bit of experience
in that arena
if you consider failure experience
i consider experience experience
almighty thanos
i
loki
prince of asgard
odinson
the rightful king of jotunheim
god of mischief
do hereby pledge to you
my undying
fidelity
undying
you should choose your words
more carefully
you
will never be
a god
no
no resurrections this time
no
loki
seriously you dont have any money
attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual
ill tell the guys at the deli
maybe theyll make you
a metaphysical ham on rye
wait wait wait wait
i think i have 200 dollars
rupees
which is
buck and a half
what do you want
i would not say no to a tuna melt
thanos is coming
he coming
who
slow down slow down
ill spell it out for you
youre totally rambling
no im not
you lost me
look you know how
youre having a dream
and in the dream you got to pee
yeah
ok
and then youre like oh my god
oh there is no bathrooms
what am i gonna do
oh someone watching
right
im gonna go in my pants
and then you wake up
and in real life you actually have to pee
yes
yeah
ok
everybody has that
right that the point
im trying to make
apropos of that
last night i dreamt we had a kid
it was so real
we named him
after your eccentric uncle
what was his name
right
morgan
morgan
so you woke up
naturally
and thought that we were
expecting
yeah
yes
no
i had a dream about it
it was so real
if you wanted to have a kid
you would not have done that
im glad you brought this up
because it nothing
it just a housing unit
for nanoparticles
youre not helping your case ok
no this is detachable it not a
you dont need that
i know i had the surgery
im just trying to protect us
and future usses and that it
just in case there is a monster
in the closet
instead of you know
shirts
you know me so well
god
you finish all my sentences
you should have shirts in your closet
yeah
you know what there should be
no more surprises

a nice dinner tonight

right and we should have
no more surprises ever
i should promise you
yes
i will
thank you
tony stark
im doctor stephen strange
i need you to come with me
congratulations on the wedding
by the way
im sorry you giving out
tickets to something
we need your help
it not overselling it to say that
the fate of the universe is at stake
and who we
hey tony
bruce
pepper
hi
you ok
at the dawn of the universe
there was nothing
then
boom
the big bang sent six elemental crystals
hurtling across the virgin universe
these infinity stones
each control an essential
aspect of existence
space
reality
power
soul
mind
and time
tell me his name again
thanos
he a plague tony
he invades planets
he takes what he wants
he wipes out half the population
he sent loki
the attack on new york that him
this is it
what our timeline
no telling
he has the power and space stones
that already makes him the strongest
creature in the whole universe
if he gets his hands
on all six stones tony
he could destroy life
on a scale hitherto undreamt of
did you seriously just say
hitherto undreamt of
are you seriously leaning
on the cauldron of the cosmos
is that what it is
im going to allow that
if thanos needs all six
why dont we just
stick this one down
a garbage disposal
no can do
we swore an oath to protect
the time stone with our lives
and i swore off dairy
but then ben & jerry named
a flavor after me so
stark raving hazelnuts
not bad
a bit chalky
a hunk of hulk of
burning fudge is our favorite
that a thing
whatever
point is things change
our oath to protect
the time stone cannot change
and this stone may be the best
chance we have against thanos
yeah so conversely it may
also be his best chance against us
so if we dont do our jobs
what is your job exactly
besides making balloon animals
protecting your reality douchebag
ok guys could we table
this discussion right now
the fact is we have this stone
we know where it is
vision is out there somewhere
with the mind stone
and we have to find him now
yeah that the thing
what do you mean
2 weeks ago vision turned
off his transponder
he offline
what
yeah
tony you lost another super-bot
i didnt lose him
he more than that he evolving
who could find vision then

what happened
oh my god
looks like were not getting paid
wipers wipers
get it off
how the hell is this dude still alive
he is not a dude
youre a dude
this
this is a man
a handsome
muscular man
im muscular
but who are you kidding quill
youre one sandwich away from fat
yeah right
it true quill
you have put on weight
what
gamora do you think im
he is anxious
angry
he feels tremendous loss and guilt
it like a pirate had a baby
with an angel
this is a real wake-up call
for me ok
im gonna get a bowflex
im gonna commit
im gonna get some dumbbells
you know you cant
eat dumbbells right
it like his muscles
are made of cotati metal fibers
stop massaging his muscles
wake him up
wake
who the hell are you guys
the entire time i knew thanos
he only ever had one goal
to bring balance to the universe
by wiping out half of all life
he used to kill people
planet by planet
massacre by massacre
including my own
if he gets all six infinity stones
he can do it with the snap
of his fingers like this
you seem to know
a great deal about thanos
gamora
is the daughter of thanos
your father killed my brother
boy
stepfather technically
and she hates him
as much as you do
families can be tough
before my father died
he told me that i had a half-sister
that he imprisoned in hel
and then she returned home
and stabbed me in the eye
so i had to kill her
that life though isnt it i guess
goes round and round and
i feel your pain
i feel your pain as well because
i mean it not a competition
but ive been through a lot
my father killed my mother
and then i had to kill my father
that was hard
probably even harder
than having to kill a sister
plus i
came out with both
my eyes which was
i need a hammer not a spoon
how do i open this thing
is there some sort of
a 4-digit code maybe
maybe a birthdate
what are you doing
taking your pod
no youre not
you will not be
taking our pod today sir
quill are you making
your voice deeper
no
you are
youre imitating the god-man
it weird
no im not
he just did it again
this is my voice
are you mocking me
are you mocking me
stop it you did it again
he trying to copy me
i need you to stop doing that
enough
he doing it first
we need to stop thanos
which means we need to find out
where he going next
knowhere
he must be going somewhere
no no knowhere
it a place
weve been there it sucks
excuse me that our food
not anymore
thor
why would he go to knowhere
because for years
the reality stone been
safely stored there
with a man called the collector
if it with the collector
then it not safe
only an idiot would
give that man a stone
or a genius
how do you know
he not going
for one of the other stones
there are six stones out there
thanos already has the power stone
because he stole it last week
when he decimated xandar
he stole the space stone from me
when he destroyed my ship
and slaughtered half my people
the time and mind stones
are safe on earth
theyre with the avengers
the avengers
earth mightiest heroes
like kevin bacon
he may be on the team
i dont know
i havent been there in a while
as for the soul stone well
no one ever seen that
no one even knows where it is
therefore thanos cant get it
therefore he going to knowhere
hence hell be getting
the reality stone
youre welcome
then we have to go to knowhere now
wrong
where we have to go is nidavellir
that a made-up word
all words are made up
nidavellir is real seriously
that place is a legend
they make the most powerful
horrific weapons
to ever torment the universe
i would very much
like to go there please
the rabbit is correct
and clearly the smartest among you
rabbit
only eitri the dwarf can
make me the weapon i need
i assume youre the captain sir
youre very perceptive
you seem like a noble leader
will you join me
on my quest to nidavellir
let me just ask the captain
wait a second it me
yeah ill go
wonderful
except for that im the captain
quiet
that my backpack
go sit down
look this is my ship
and im not going to
wait what kinda weapon
are we talking about here
the thanos-killing kind
dont you think that we should
all have a weapon like that
no you simply lack
the strength to wield them
your bodies would crumble
as your minds collapsed
into madness
is it weird that i wanna do it
even more now
a little bit yeah
if we dont go to knowhere
and thanos retrieves another stone
hell be too powerful to stop
he already is
i got it figured out
we got two ships
and a large assortment of morons
so me and groot will go
with the pirate angel here
and the morons will go to knowhere
to try to stop thanos
cool cool
so cool
for the record
i know that youre going with him
because it where thanos isnt
you know you really should not
talk that way to your captain quill
come on groot
put that game down
youll rot your brain
i bid you farewell
and good luck morons
bye
vis
is it the stone again
it as if it speaking to me
what does it say
i dont i dont know but something
hey
tell me what you feel
i just feel you
so there is a 000 am to glasgow
which would give us more time
together before you went back
what if i miss that train
there an 00
what if i missed all the trains
what if this time i didnt go back
but you gave stark your word
id rather give it to you
well there are people who are
expecting me too you know
we both made promises
not to each other
wanda
for 2 years
weve stolen these moments
trying to see if this could work and
i dont know i beleiv as
you know what im just
gonna speak for myself
i i i think i
i i think
it works it works
it works
it works
stay
stay with me
or not if im overstepping
what are they
what the stone was warning me about
i have to go
no vision
vision if that true then
maybe going isnt the best idea
wanda i
vision
the blade
it stopped me from phasing
is that even possible
it isnt supposed to be
my systems are failing
im beginning to think
we should have stayed in bed
vis
give up the stone
and she lives
hands off
come on come on
come on you got to get up
you got to get up
come on
hey
hey we have to go
please please leave
you asked me to stay
im staying
please

we dont wanna kill you but we will
youll never get the chance again
can you stand
thank you captain

zehobereians
mother
where my mother
choose a side or die
mother
one side is a revelation
the other an honor
known only to a few
what wrong little one
my mother
where is my mother
what your name
gamora
youre quite the fighter gamora
come
let me help you
look
pretty isnt it
perfectly balanced
as all things should be
too much to one side
or the other
here
you try
now go in peace
to meet your maker
concentrate
there youve got it
gamora
do you know if these grenades
are the blow-off-your-junk
kind or the gas kind
because i was thinking about hanging
a couple on my belt right here
but i dont want to
i need to ask a favor
yeah sure
one way or another
the path that were on leads to thanos
which is what the grenades are for
yeah im sorry
what the what the favor
if things go wrong
if thanos gets me
i want you to promise me
youll kill me
what
i know something he doesnt
and if he finds it out
the entire universe could be at risk
what do you know
if i tell you youd know too
if it so important
should not i
only if you wanna die
why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario
just
trust me
and possibly kill me
i mean
id like to
i really would but you
swear to me
swear to me on your mother
ok
ok
dude
how long have you been
standing there
an hour
an hour
are you serious
ive mastered the ability
of standing so incredibly still
that i become invisible to the eye
watch
youre eating a zarg-nut
but my movement
was so slow
that it imperceptible
no
im sure im invisible
hi drax
damn it
this place looks deserted
im reading movement
in the third quadrant
yep im picking that up too
let put down right here
i dont have it
everyone in the galaxy knows
youd sell your own brother
if you thought it would add
even the slightest trinket
to your pathetic collection
i know you have
the reality stone tivan
giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering
i told you
i sold it
why would i lie
i imagine it like breathing for you
like suicide
you do understand
not even you would surrender
something so precious
i didnt know what it was
then youre more of a fool
than i took you for
it him
last chance charlatan
where the stone
today
drax drax
he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter
drax wait
not yet not yet not yet
drax
drax drax drax
listen to me
he doesnt have the stone yet
if we get it then we can stop him
we have to get the stone first
yeah
no
no for ovette for camaria
sleep
ok
gamora mantis you go right
the other right
why
why you daughter
that was quick
magnificent
magnificent
magnificent
is that sadness
i sense in you daughter
in my heart i knew you still cared
but one never knows for sure
reality is often disappointing
that is it was
now
reality can be whatever i want
you knew id come
i counted on it
there something we need
to discuss little one
thanos
no
let her go grimace
peter
i told you to go right
now really
you let her go
ah the boyfriend
no
like to think of myself
more as a titan-killing
long-term booty call
let her go
peter
im gonna blow that nutsack
of a chin right off your face
not him
you promised
you promised
daughter
you expect too much from him
she asked hasnt she
do it
do it
i told you to go right
i love you more than anything
i love you too
i like him
still no word from vision
satellites lost him
somewhere over edinburgh
on a stolen quinjet
with four of the world
most wanted criminals
you know theyre only criminals because
youve chosen to call them that right sir
oh my god rhodes
your talent for horseshit rivals my own
if it werent for those accords
vision would have been right here
i remember your signature
on those papers colonel
that right
and im pretty sure i paid for that
you have second thoughts
not anymore
mr secretary
you got some nerve
ill give you that
you could use some of that right now
the world on fire
and you think all is forgiven
im not looking for forgiveness
and im way past asking permission
earth just lost her best defender
so were here to fight
and if you wanna stand in our way
well fight you too
arrest them
all over it
that a court-martial
it great to see you cap
you too rhodey
hey
well
you guys
really look like crap
mustve been a rough couple years
yeah well the hotels
werent exactly five star
i think you look great
yeah im back
hi bruce
nat
this is awkward
so we got to assume
theyre coming back right
and they can clearly find us
we need all hands on deck
where clint
after the whole accords situation
he and scott took a deal
it was too tough on their families
theyre on house arrest
who scott
ant-man
there an ant-man and a spider-man
ok look
thanos has the biggest army
in the universe
and he is not gonna stop until
he gets
vision stone
then we have to protect it
no we have to destroy it
ive been giving a good deal of thought
to this entity in my head
about its nature
but also its composition
i think if it were exposed
to a sufficiently powerful
energy source
something very similar
to its own signature perhaps
its molecular integrity could fail
yeah and you with it
were not having this conversation
eliminating the stone is the only way
to be certain that thanos cant get it
that too high a price
only you have the power to pay it
thanos threatens half the universe
one life cannot stand
in the way of defeating him
but it should
we dont trade lives vision
captain 70 years ago
you laid down your life
to save how many millions of people
tell me why is this any different
because you might have a choice
your mind is made up
of a complex construct of overlays
jarvis ultron tony me the stone
all of them mixed together
all of them learning from one another
youre saying vision
isnt just the stone
im saying that if we take out the stone
there is still a whole lot of vision left
perhaps the best parts
can we do that
not me not here
well you better find someone
and somewhere fast
ross isnt just gonna let you guys
have your old rooms back
i know somewhere
the kingsguard and the dora milaje
have been alerted
and the border tribe
those that are left
send word to the jabari as well
mbaku likes a good fight
and what of this one
this one may be tired of war
but the white wolf
has rested long enough
where the fight
on its way
in all the time ive served thanos
i have never failed him
if i were to reach
our rendezvous on titan
with the time stone still attached
to your vaguely irritating person
there would be judgment
give me
the stone
youre a seriously loyal piece
of outerwear arent you
yeah speaking of loyalty
what the
i know what youre gonna say
you should not be here
i was gonna go home
i dont wanna hear it
but it was such a long way down
and i just thought
about you on the way
and now i got to hear it
and kinda stuck to the side of the ship
and this suit is
ridiculously intuitive by the way
god damn it
so if anything it kinda
your fault that im here
what did you just say
i take that back
and and now im here in space
yeah
rght where i didnt want you to be
this isnt coney island
this isnt a field trip
this is a one-way ticket
you hear me
dont pretend you thought this through
no i did
i know you did
you could not have
no i did think this through
possibly thought this through
you cant be a friendly
neighborhood spider-man
if there is no neighborhood
ok that didnt really make sense
but you know what im trying to say
come on we got a situation
see him down there
he in trouble
what your plan
go
ok ok
ok did you ever see
this really old movie aliens
painful arent they
they were originally designed
for microsurgery
and any one of them
could end your friend life in an instant
i got to tell you
he not really my friend
saving his life is more
of a professional courtesy
youve saved nothing
your powers are inconsequential
compared to mine
yeah but the kid seen more movies
yes
wait what are those
hey we havent officially met
cool
we got to turn this ship around
yeah now he wants to run
great plan
no i want to protect the stone
and i want you to thank me
now go ahead im listening
for what
nearly blasting me into space
who just saved your magical ass
me
i seriously dont know
how you fit your head into that helmet
admit it you should have
ducked out when i told you to
i tried to bench you
you refused
unlike everyone else in your life
i dont work for you
and due to that fact
were now in a flying doughnut
billions of miles from earth
with no backup
im backup
no youre a stowaway
the adults are talking
im sorry im confused
as to the relationship here
what is he your ward
no
im peter by the way
doctor strange
youre using our made-up names
im spider-man then
this ship is self-correcting its course
thing on autopilot
can we control it
fly us home
stark
yeah
can you get us home
yeah i heard you
im thinking im not so sure we should
under no circumstances
can we bring the time stone
to thanos
i dont think you quite understand
what at stake here
what no
it you who doesnt understand
that thanos has been
inside my head for 6 years
since he sent an army to new york
and now he back
and i dont know what to do
so im not so sure
if it a better plan to fight
him on our turf or his
but you saw what they did
what they can do
at least on his turf
he not expecting it
so i say we take the fight to him
doctor
do you concur
alright stark
we go to him
but you have to understand
if it comes to saving you
or the kid
or the time stone
i will not hesitate
to let either of you die
i cant
because the universe depends on it
nice
good moral compass
were straight
alright kid
youre an avenger now
i thought you might be hungry
i always hated that chair
so ive been told
even so
id hoped youd sit in it one day
i hated this room
this ship
i hated my life
you told me that too
every day
for almost 20 years
i was a child when you took me
i saved you
no
no
we were happy on my home planet
going to bed hungry
scrounging for scraps
your planet was
on the brink of collapse
im the one who stopped that
do you know
what happened since then
the children born
have known nothing
but full bellies and clear skies
it a paradise
because you murdered half the planet
a small price to pay for salvation
youre insane
little one it a simple calculus
this universe is finite
its resources finite
if life is left unchecked
life will cease to exist
it needs correction
you dont know that
im the only one who knows that
at least im the only one
with the will to act on it
for a time
you
had that same will
as you fought by my side
daughter
im not your daughter
everything i hate about myself
you taught me
and in doing so
made you the fiercest woman
in the galaxy
that why i trusted you
to find the soul stone
im sorry i disappointed you
i am disappointed
but not because you didnt find it
but because you did
and you lied
nebula
dont do this
some time ago
your sister snuck aboard
this ship to kill me
please dont do this
and very nearly succeeded
so i brought her here
to talk
stop it
stop it
i swear to you on my life
i never found the soul stone
accessing memory files
you know what he about to do
he finally ready
and he going for the stones
all of them
he can never get them all
he will
he cant nebula
because i found the map
to the soul stone
and i burned it to ash
i burned it
youre strong
me
youre generous
me
but i never taught you to lie
that why youre so bad at it
where is the soul stone
vormir
the stone is on vormir
show me
i am groot
tinkle in the cup
were not looking
what there to see
what a twig
everybody seen a twig before
i am groot
tree pour what in the cup out
into space and go in the cup again
you speak groot
yes they taught it on asgard
it was an elective
i am groot
youll know when were close
nidavellir forge harnesses
the blazing power of a neutron star
it the birthplace of my hammer
it truly awesome
ok
time to be the captain
so dead brother
yeah that could be annoying
well he been dead before
but no this time i think
it really might be true
and you said
your sister and your dad
both dead
but still got a mom though
killed by a dark elf
a best friend
stabbed through the heart
you sure youre up to this
particular murder mission
absolutely
rage and vengeance
anger loss regret
theyre all tremendous motivators
they really clear the mind
so im good to go
yeah but i mean this thanos
were talking about
he the toughest there is
well he never fought me
yeah he has
he never fought me twice
and im getting a new hammer
dont forget
it better be some hammer
you know im 500 years old
ive killed twice
as many enemies as that
and every one of them
would have rather killed me
but none succeeded
im only alive
because fate wants me alive
thanos is just the latest
in a long line of bastards
and hell be the latest
to feel my vengeance
fate wills it so
and what if youre wrong
if im wrong then
what more could i lose
i could lose a lot
me personally i could lose a lot
ok
well
if fate does want you
to kill that crapsack
youre gonna need more
than one stupid eyeball
what this
what it look like
some jerk lost a bet with me
on contraxia
he gave you his eye
no he gave me 00 credits
i snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye
thank you sweet rabbit
i would have washed that
the only way i could sneak it
off contraxia was up my
hey were here
i dont think this thing works
everything seems dark
it aint the eye
something wrong
the star gone out
and the rings are frozen
i hope these dwarves are better
at forging than they are cleaning
maybe they realized
that they live in a junk pile
in the middle of space
this forge hasnt gone dark
in centuries
you said thanos had a gauntlet right
yes why
it look anything like that
i am groot
go back to the pod
eitri wait
stop
stop
thor
what happened here
you were supposed to protect us
asgard was supposed
to protect us
asgard is destroyed
eitri
the glove what did you do
300 dwarves lived on this ring
i thought if i did what
he asked theyd be safe
i made what he wanted
a device
capable of harnessing
the power of the stones
then he
then he killed everyone anyway
all except me
your life is yours he said
but your hands
your hands are mine alone
eitri this isnt about your hands
every weapon youve ever designed
every axe hammer sword
it all inside your head
now i know it feels
like all hope is lost
trust me i know
but together
you and i
we can kill thanos
mantis listen very carefully
i need you to meet me on titan
hey what going on
i think were here
i dont think this rig has
a self-park function
get your hand
inside the steering gimbal
close those around it
alright ok
you made it
yep got it
this was meant for one big guy
so we got to move at the same time
ok ok ready

i owe you one
let me just say if aliens
wind up implanting eggs
in my chest or something
and i eat one of you im sorry
i do not want another
single pop culture reference
out of you for the rest
of the trip you understand
im trying to say
that something is coming
thanos

youre the ones thor told us about
you know thor
yeah
tall guy not that good-looking
needed saving
where is he now
this is the plan
were gonna hit him with a brick
it a mold
a king weapon
meant to be the greatest in asgard
in theory it could even
summon the bifrost
did it have a name
stormbreaker
that a bit much
so how do we make it
youll have to restart the forge
awaken the heart of a dying star
rabbit fire up the pod
the hell happened to this planet
it eight degrees off its axis
gravitational pull is all over the place
yeah we got one advantage
he coming to us
well use it
alright i have a plan
or at least the beginnings of one
it pretty simple
we draw him in
pin him down get what we need
definitely dont wanna
dance with this guy
we just want the gauntlet
are you yawning
in the middle of this
while im breaking it down
did you hear what i said
i stopped listening after
you said we need a plan
ok mr clean is on his own page
see not winging it isnt really what they do
what exactly is it that they do
kick names take ass
yeah that right
alright just get over here please
mr lord can you get
your folks to circle up
mr lord star-lord is fine
we got to coalesce
because if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude
dude
dont call us plucky
we dont know what it means
alright were optimistic yes
i like your plan
except it sucks so let me do the plan
and that way it might be really good
tell him about the dance-off
to save the universe
what dance-off
it no it nothing
like in footloose the movie
exactly like footloose
is it still the greatest movie in history
it never was
dont encourage this alright
ok
were getting no help
from flash gordon here
flash gordon
by the way that a compliment
dont forget im half human
so that 50% of me that stupid
that 00% you
your math is blowing my mind
excuse me
but does your friend
often do that
strange we alright
youre back youre alright
hi
hey what was that
i went forward in time
to view alternate futures
to see all the possible outcomes
of the coming conflict
how many did you see
how many did we win
one
the stone had better be up there
for your sister sake
welcome thanos
son of alars
gamora
daughter of thanos
you know us
it is my curse to know all
who journey here
where is the soul stone
you should know
it extracts a terrible price
i am prepared
we all think that at first
we are all wrong
how is it you know this place so well
a lifetime ago
i too sought the stones
i even held one in my hand
but it cast me out
banished me here
guiding others to a treasure
i cannot possess
what you seek
lies in front of you
as does what you fear
what this
the price
soul holds a special place
among the infinity stones
you might say it has a certain wisdom
tell me what it needs
to ensure that whoever possesses it
understands its power
the stone demands a sacrifice
of what
in order to take the stone
you must lose that which you love
a soul
for a soul
all my life
i dreamed of a day
a moment
when you got what you deserved
and i was always so disappointed
but now
you kill and torture
and you call it mercy
the universe has judged you
you asked it for a prize
and it told you no
you failed
and do you wanna know why
because you love nothing
no one
no
really
tears
theyre not for him
no
this isnt love
i ignored my destiny once
i cannot do that again
even
for you
im sorry little one
no
drop to 2600 heading 0-3-0
i hope youre right about this
or were gonna land
a lot faster than you want to
when you said we were
going to open wakanda
to the rest of the world
this is not what i imagined
and what did you imagine
the olympics
maybe even a starbucks
should we bow
yeah he a king
seems like im always
thanking you for something
what are you doing
we dont do that here
so how big of an assault
should we expect
sir sir i think you should
expect quite a big assault
how we looking
you will have my kingsguard
the border tribe
the dora milaje and
and a semi-stable 00-year-old man
how you been buck
not bad
for the end of the world
the structure is polymorphic
right we had to attach
each neuron non-sequentially
why didnt you just reprogram
the synapses to work collectively
because we didnt think of it
im sure you did your best
can you do it
yes but there are more than
2 trillion neurons here
one misalignment could cause
a cascade of circuit failures
it will take time brother
how long
as long as you can give me
something entered the atmosphere
hey cap we got a situation here
god i love this place
yeah dont start celebrating yet guys
we got more incoming
outside the dome
it too late
we need to destroy the stone now
vision get your ass back on the table
we will hold them off
wanda
as soon as that
stone out of his head
you blow it to hell
i will
evacuate the city
engage all defenses
and get this man a shield
i dont think
you get the scientifics here
these rings are gigantic
you wanna get them moving
youre gonna need something
a lot bigger to yank them loose
leave that to me
leave it to you
buddy youre in space
all you got is a rope and a
fire the engines
more power rabbit
well done boy
that nidavellir
damn it
damn it what damn it
the mechanism is crippled
what
with the iris closed
i cant heat the metal
how long will it take to heat it
a few minutes maybe more why
im gonna hold it open
that suicide
so is facing thanos without that axe
how we looking bruce
yeah i think im getting the hang of it
this is amazing man
it like being the hulk without actually
im ok
im ok
ive got two heat signatures
breaking through the tree line
thank you for standing with us
of course brother
where your other friend
you will pay for his life with yours
thanos will have that stone
that not gonna happen
you are in wakanda now
thanos will have nothing
but dust and blood
we
have blood to spare
they surrender
not exactly
what the hell
looks like we pissed her off
theyre killing themselves
you see the teeth on those things
alright back up sam
youre gonna get your wings singed
cap if these things circle the perimeter
and get in behind us
there is nothing
between them and vision
then we better keep them
in front of us
how do we do that
we open the barrier
on my signal
open north-west section eventeen
requesting confirmation my king
you said open the barrier
on my signal
this will be the end of wakanda
then it will be the noblest
ending in history
wakanda forever
now
how much longer shuri
ive barely begun brother
you might want to pick up the pace
allfathers give me strength
you understand boy
youre about to take
the full force of a star
itll kill you
only if i die
yes
that what killing you means
hold it hold it thor
thor say something come on
thor you ok
i think he dying
he needs the axe
where the handle
tree help me find the handle
there too many of them
you guys are so screwed now
bring me thanos
yeah
youre much more of a thanos
i take it the maw is dead
this day extracts a heavy toll
still he accomplished his mission
you may regret that
he brought you face-to-face
with the master of the mystic arts
and where do you think
he brought you
let me guess
your home
it was
and it was beautiful
titan was like most planets
too many mouths
not enough to go around
and when we faced extinction
i offered a solution
genocide
but random
dispassionate fair to rich
and poor alike
they called me a madman
and what i predicted came to pass
congratulations youre a prophet
im a survivor
who wants to murder trillions
with all six stones
i could simply snap my fingers
they would all cease to exist
i call that
mercy
and then what
id finally rest
and watch the sun rise
on a grateful universe
the hardest choices require
the strongest wills
i think youll find our will
equal to yours
our
piece of cake quill
yeah if your goal was to piss him off
boom
dont let him close his fist
magic
more magic
magic with a kick
magic with a
insect
well well
you should have killed me
it would have been a waste of parts
where gamora
is he under
dont let up
be quick he is very strong
parker help
get over here
she cant hold him much longer
let go
we got to open his fingers to get it off
i thought youd be hard to catch
for the record this was my plan
youre not so strong now
