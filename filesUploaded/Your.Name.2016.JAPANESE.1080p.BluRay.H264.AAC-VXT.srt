once in a while when i wake up
i find myself crying
the dream i must have had
i can never recall
but
but
the sensation that ive lost something
lingers for a long time after i wake up
im always searching
for something for someone
this feeling has possessed me
i think from that day
that day when the stars came falling
it was almost as if
as if a scene from a dream
nothing more nothing less
than a beautiful view
ah if only our voices speak at night
could ever reach the very edge of this world
and the time
instead of fading into air and dust
then what will the words could ever be
farthest words from probably
let make a promise that will never fade
let say it together in count of three oh
ah im told that some part of every wish
will be heard
but lately i lost sight of the truth in those words
i cant even remember when i gave up believing
what could have been the reason
ah the very moment that the rain will stop
and the place rainbow born and dies
and where the end of this life lies
ive always been insisting
there was something that ive longing for
one day well reach to emotions
unexplored unprecedented
well high-five love weve yet to
discover and give a kiss to time
the five dimensions keep on teasing me
but i will keep on looking at you dear
let make a sign for when we say
nice to meet you again
im on my way to you chasing after your name
taki taki
dont you remember me

tasokare
tasokare means who is that and is
the origin of the word tasogare-doki
twilight when it
neither day nor night
when the world blurs and one might
encounter something not human
older expressions include
karetaso-doki
karetaso/kawatare = who is that
kataware-doki i think
that a local dialect
ive heard that itomori elderly
still use classical language

yesterday you forgot where your desk
and locker were

what no way really

your previous life

linked to the everett multiverse
stay out of this
oh tessie did you write that
in my notebook
nothing
but mitsuha you really were
a bit weird yesterday

youre not ready yet yotsuha
listen to the thread voice

emotions will eventually start flowing
between you and the thread
threads dont talk
she means concentrate
000 years of itomori history is etched
into our braided cords
listen 200 years ago
here she goes again
sandal maker mayugoro bathroom caught
on fire and burned down this whole area
the shrine and old documents
were destroyed
and this is known as
the great fire of mayugoro
the fire has his name poor mayugoro
so the meaning of our festivals became
unknown and only the form lived on
but even if words are lost
tradition should be handed down
that the important task

im beginning to get what going on
taki is a boy my age living in tokyo
i switch with mitsuha at random
a few times a week unexpectedly
sleep triggers it
the cause is a mystery
condition sleep
cause unknown
my memory of the switch is hazy
after i wake up
but were definitely switching places
it obvious from the reactions
of the people around us so
so we laid down some rules
to protect each other lifestyles
no baths no looking
no touching
things to watch out during the switch
and a list of donts
dont waste money no dialect
dont be late
we also agreed to leave reports
in our smartphones
to work together to tide over
this mysterious phenomenon
but
but
that girl
that guy
guys are staring watch the skirt
come on this is basic
stop wasting my money
it your body eating
and im working too
braided cords
braided cords i cant do this
you work too many shifts
it cause you waste money
grabbed coffee with ms okudera
you two have a good thing going
mitsuha stop changing my relationships
taki why is a girl in love with me
youre more popular when im you
dont be full of yourself

comet tiamat has been visible
to the naked eye for a few days now
when and where can it be seen
comet tiamat to reach perigee
comet tiamat is moving from east to west
as if to follow the sun
so it can be seen above venus
why the uniform
grandma why is the body
of our shrine god so far away
i dont know because of mayugoro
who that
what he famous
here grandma
whoa mitsuha
mitsuha yotsuha do you know musubi
musubi
musubi is the old way of calling
the local guardian god
this word has profound meaning
tying thread is musubi
connecting people is musubi
the flow of time is musubi
these are all the god power
so the braided cords that we make
are the god art and represent
the flow of time itself
they converge and take shape
they twist tangle
sometimes unravel break
then connect again
musubi knotting that time
drink
thank you
i want some too
that also musubi
whether it be water rice or sake
when a person consumes something and
it joins their soul that musubi
so today offering
is an important custom that
connects the god and people
hey i see it
that the body
of miyamizu shrine god
beyond this point is kakuriyo
it means the underworld
it the underworld
in exchange for returning to this world
you must leave behind
what is most important to you
the kuchikamisake
the kuchikamisake
youll offer it inside the god body
it half of you
half of mitsuha
it twilight kataware-doki already
kataware-doki
oh yeah
maybe i can see the comet

that much hair
oh hey you can see it
wow
the number you are trying to call is not
reachable or has been turned off
ill tell her about the disastrous date
the next time we switch
i thought but
for some reason after that
mitsuha and i never
switched places again
mountains in gifu prefecture
hida mountains
what the what are you doing here
tsukasa told me and here i am
tsukasa i asked you to cover for me
at home and at work
takagi will cover your shift

this isnt funny
we were worried about you
huh
you cant go alone what if it a con act
a con act
youre meeting an online friend
well no not exactly
i think he using a dating site
no
youve been acting weird lately
well keep an eye on you

the switching stopped
my calls and texts didnt go through
so i decided to go see mitsuha
in person
i wanted to meet her but
what you dont know where
the town scenery is your only clue
yes
and you cant contact her
what this all about
seriously what a lousy tour planner
i did not plan a tour
oh well well help you look for her

what after all the trouble
we went through
you havent done anything
a takayama ramen
a takayama ramen
oh then a takayama ramen
okay 3 ramens
okay
can we return to tokyo today
we could be cutting it close
ill check
thanks
are you all right with that
im starting to feel like
im barking up the wrong tree
why young man
that itomori isnt it
it a very good drawing
isnt it dear
yeah it itomori
brings back memories
he was born in itomori
itomori
yes itomori town that it
it nearby isnt it
what are you
itomori was
itomori no way
is it where that comet
keep out
hey is this really the place
no way taki must be misremembering
no im sure this is it
this schoolyard the mountains
i remember this high school clearly
that cant be true
surely you remember that disaster
that took hundreds of lives 3 years ago
died
died 3 years ago
that cant be
i still have the memos
that she left behind
theyre disappearing
comet tiamat with an orbital period
of 200 years
itomori
the town that vanished
made a close approach to earth
3 years ago in october
meteor strikes wipes out town nobody predicted
that its nucleus would split at its perigee
town annihilated
over 500 dead or missing
itomori the town that vanished
a fragment of the comet became
a meteor that struck japan
itomori comet damage
it was the day of the autumn festival
the point of impact was here
at 842 pm it struck where people
were gathered for the festival
list of the names of victims
over 500 people died
a third of the town population
and now nobody lives in itomori anymore
tessie and sayaka
mitsuha miyamizu
it has to be some kind of mistake
this person died 3 years ago
just 2 3 weeks ago she said to me
that the comet would be visible
so
you re dreaming now
i
arent you
i
what did i
lively up there
im sorry we could only get one room
no problem
how taki
he still reading articles on itomori
newspapers and magazines
at the time at random it seems
what
nothing i didnt know you smoked
oh id quit recently but
what do you think about taki story
i liked him
the way he was recently he was always
a nice guy but even more so lately
like he was trying so hard it was cute
what he saying
doesnt make sense to me
but im sure he met someone
and that someone changed him
that much is for sure i think
worst-ever
itomori comet disaster
it was all just a dream
i recognized the scenery because
i remembered the news from 3 years ago
if not that then a ghost
no was i fantasizing
her name what was it
tsukasa went to take a bath
oh msokudera i uh
ive been saying such strange things
thank you for coming along today
no problem
tatara iron making site
braided cords of itomori
braided cords how pretty
is that a braided cord youre wearing
oh this i think someone
gave it to me a long time ago
i wear it sometimes
as kind of a lucky charm
who was it
why dont you go take a bath too
yesno
someone who makes braided cords
told me before
the cords represent
the flow of time itself
the threads twist tangle
unravel and connect again that time
maybe at that place
around here
taki
taki
taki
dont you remember me
i have to go somewhere return to tokyo
without me ill return later thanks
taki
eat this up there
your drawing of itomori it was good

sometimes unravel
then connect again
musubi knotting that time

its perigee around 740 pm
and will achieve its maximum brightness
it tonight there still time
good morning mitsuha
oh
youre not mitsuha are you
you knew grandma
no but watching the way you behaved
lately triggered some memories
i also remember seeing strange dreams
when i was a young girl
although now ive forgotten about
whose life i was dreaming about
forgotten
treasure the experience
dreams fade away after you wake up
there were times your mother and i
had similar experiences
maybe those dreams that
the miyamizu people had
were all for what will happen today
grandma listen
a comet will strike itomori tonight
and everyone will die
nobody will believe that what a
surprisingly ordinary reply grandma
i wont let them die
oh what happened mitsuha
your your hair
oh this it looked better before huh
oh that it
forget that if nothing is done
everyone will die tonight
so we have to act
why arent you at school
uh we have to save the town
the community wireless system

deal with it
what about you have you come up
with an escape plan
what a bomb
we have water gel explosives
for construction at our storage site
broadcast hijacking
the town wireless system can be easily
jacked using the startup frequency
so we can broadcast an evacuation
warning from the school
the school is outside the disaster area
so people can evacuate here
it it totally a crime
you do the broadcast
why
youre in the broadcast club
im in charge of explosives
ill go talk to the mayor
in the end the city council
has to evacuate everyone
im his daughter i can persuade him
it a perfect plan
oh whatever it just a
what-if fantasy isnt it
what well
not necessarily do you know
how lake itomori was formed
a meteor crater lake
formed 200 years ago
it a meteor crater so one did strike
this area a thousand years ago
oh so that why
youre right tessie

i said we have to evacuate everyone
in town before tonight or
shut your mouth

strike the town

katsuhiko
what are you doing
sorry mitsuha
it over
it really splitting apart
look at that
wow
please look the comet has split in two
and meteors are falling
nobody predicted this
we have a mystical view here
so the comet nucleus split
did tidal forces affect
the comet isnt within the roche limit
so the nucleus itself must have
in the past comet shoemaker-levy 9
broke and collided with jupiter in 994
at least twenty-one fragments
im going to go look
they will probably melt
before reaching the ground
and the probability of a meteor crashing
into a residential area is small
to predict the trajectory
to be witnessing such a magnificent
celestial event and
that were witnessing this live
is extremely fortunate
for those of us living in this age
hey who are you
who who
who is that
someone dear to me i shouldnt forget
i didnt want to forget
who who who are you
what your name
it broken
so we dont forget when we wake up
let write our names on each other
i love you
i cant remember your name with this
dad
mitsuha
mitsuha
not you again
it was almost as if it were
a scene from a dream
nothing more nothing less
than a beautiful view
what am i doing here
im always searching for something
this feeling has possessed me
for some time
i applied because
the landscapes people live in
to build a city landscape
you never know when tokyo
might disappear as well
so i want to help build landscapes that
leave heartwarming memories
how many interviews have you had
i havent kept track
cant see you landing a job
thanks a lot
maybe it because of that suit
were not that different
i have 2 job offers
i have 8
you have a new message
im not sure if im
searching for a person or a place
or if im just searching for a job
oh youre job-hunting
i havent had much luck
maybe it because of that suit
does it look that bad
what brings you here today
i came nearby for work
so i figured id say hi to you
8 years
since the comet disaster
we went to itomori once didnt we
you were still in high school so it was
5 years ago
that long
seems like ive forgotten a lot
i too no longer remember much
from back then
maybe we had a disagreement; the other two
returned to tokyo without me
i spent the night alone
on some mountain
that about all i remember
but at one point
i was inexplicably drawn
to the events surrounding that comet
half of a comet destroyed a town
in that disaster
evacuation of residents
to high school grounds confirmed
the entire town happened to be
holding an emergency drill
an unprecedented
natural disaster
and most of its residents were outside
the blast zone
disaster foretold
the sheer luck and coincidence
sparked various rumors
mayor miyamizu
hidden agenda
i intently read those articles back then
what had caught my interest
so much is now a mystery to me
i didnt even know anybody in that town
thanks for today this is far enough
you be happy someday too
i feel like im always searching
for something for someone
construction company job interview
i want to go to another bridal fair
theyre all the same
shinto-style is nice too
you wanted a wedding in a chapel
oh and tessie
lose the beard before the wedding
ill lose 3 kg
youre eating a cake
ill start tomorrow
itomori the town that vanished
october 4 203itomori vanished
kadoiri bridge
itomori elementary school
miyamizu shrine
why does the scenery
of a town that no longer exists
wring my heart so
now just a little more
only just a little more
let stay here a little longer now
just a little more
only just a little more
let stick together just a little bit longer
just a little more
only just a little more
let stay here a little longer now
now just a little more
only just a little more
let stick together just a little bit longer
i was always searching
searching
for someone
oh yes we are time flyers
scaling the walls of time climber
tired of playing hide and seek with time
and always coming just short
i never let you go now
promise i will never let you go now
cause my hand finally
has reached yours why would i have to
oh yes youre quite a showy crier
want to stop your tears see your eyes drier
but when i went to wipe your tears dry
you refused
but i saw them pouring down your face
i knew why
crying even when youre happy
smiling even when youre feeling lonely
it because the part of you
has made it here before the rest has
hey
havent we met
i thought so too
your name is
