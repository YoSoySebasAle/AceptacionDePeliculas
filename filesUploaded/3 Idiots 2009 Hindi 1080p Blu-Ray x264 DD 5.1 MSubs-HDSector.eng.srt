free as the wind was he
like a soaring kite was he
where did he go let find him
we were led by the path we took
while he carved a path of his own
stumbling rising carefree walked he
we fretted about the morrow
he simply reveled in today
living each moment to the fullest
where did he come from
he who touched our
hearts and vanished
where did he go let find him
in scorching sun
he was like a patch of shade
in an endless desert like an oasis
on a bruised heart
like soothing balm was he
afraid we stayed confined in the well
fearless he frolicked in the river
never hesitating to swim
against the tide
he wandered lonesome as a cloud
yet he was our dearest friend
where did he go let find him
rancho

salt water is a great conductor
of electricity 8th grade physics
we had studied it he applied it
dr viru sahastrabuddhe
was the director of ice
students called him virus
computer virus
virus on the way with eggs
freshmen are summoned
come quickly
virus was the most competitive
man we had ever seen
he couldnt bear anyone
getting ahead of him
to save time
his shirts had velcro
and his ties had hooks
hed trained his mind to write
with both hands simultaneously
everyday at 2 pm he took a
7½ minute power nap
with an opera as lullaby
govind his valet had instructions
to carry out all unproductive tasks
such as shaving nail-cutting etc
what is this
sir nest
whose
a koel bird nest sir
wrong
a koel bird never makes
her own nest
she lays her eggs in other nests
and when they hatch
what do they do
they push the other eggs
out of the nest
competition over
their life begins with murder
that nature
compete or die
you also are like the koel birds
and these are the eggs
you smashed to get into ice
dont forget ice gets
400000 applications a year
and only 200 are selected you
and these finished broken eggs
my son he tried for three years
rejected every time
remember life is a race
if you dont run fast
youll get trampled
let me tell you a
very interesting story
this is an astronaut pen
fountain pens and ballpoint pens
dont work in outer space
so scientists spent
millions to invent this pen
it can write at any angle in any
temperature in zero gravity
one day when i was a student
the director of our institute
called me
he said viru sahastrabuddhe
i said yes sir
come here i got scared
he showed me this pen
he said this is a
symbol of excellence
i give it to you
when you come across an
extraordinary student like yourself
pass it onto him
for 32 years ive been
waiting for that student
but no luck
anyone here wholl strive
to win this pen
good put your hands down
shall i post it on the notice board
hands down
one question sir
sir if pens didnt work
in outer space
why didnt the astronauts
use a pencil
theyd have saved millions
i will get back to you on this
he zaps a senior privates
at night
fingers the director in the day
best avoid him
you deflated virus erection
your majesty thou art great
accept this humble offering
buzz off you dont have school
wholl pay for it your pop
keep off my dad
relax
for school you dont need
tuition money just a uniform
pick a school
buy the uniform slip into class
in that sea of kids
no one will notice
if i get caught
then new uniform new school
see that he was different
he challenged conventions
at every stage
a free-spirited bird had
landed in virus nest
we were robots blindly following
our professors commands
he was the only one
who was not a machine
what is a machine
whyre you smiling
sir to study engineering
was a childhood dream
im so happy to be here finally
no need to be so happy
define a machine
a machine is anything that
reduces human effort
will you please elaborate
anything that simplifies work
or saves time is a machine
it a warm day press a button
get a blast of air
the fan a machine
speak to a friend miles away
the telephone a machine
compute millions in seconds
the calculator a machine
were surrounded by machines
from a pen nib to a pants zip -
all machines
up and down in a second
up down up down
what is the definition
i just gave it to you sir
youll write this in the exam
this is a machine up down
idiot anybody else
yes
sir machines are any combination
of bodies so connected
that their relative motions
are constrained
and by which means force
and motion may be transmitted
and modified as a screw
and its nut or a lever arranged
to turn about a fulcrum
or a pulley about its pivot etc
especially a construction
more or less complex
consisting of a combination
of moving parts or
simple mechanical elements
as wheels levers cams etc
wonderful
perfect please sit down
thank you
but sir i said the same thing
in simple language
if you prefer simple language
join an arts and commerce college
but sir one must get
the meaning too
what the point of blindly
cramming a bookish definition
you think youre smarter
than the book
write the textbook definition mister
if you want to pass
but there are other books
get out
why
in simple language out
idiot
so we were discussing
the machine
whyre you back
i forgot something
what
instruments that record
analyze summarize organize
debate and explain information;
that are illustrated non-illustrated
hard-bound paperback
jacketed non jacketed
with foreword introduction
table-of-contents index
that are intended for the
enlightenment understanding
enrichment enhancement and
education of the human brain
through the sensory route of
vision sometimes touch
what do you mean
books sir
i forgot my books may i
couldnt you ask simply
i tried earlier sir
it simply didnt work
professors kept rancho
mostly out seldom in
when thrown out of one class
hed slip into another
he said first year or fourth year
it knowledge just grab it
he was unlike any of us
we fought for a shower
every morning
hed bathe wherever
he found water
morning sir
machines were his passion
when he spotted them
he opened them
some he could re-assemble
some he couldnt
there was another just like him
joy lobo
sir excuse me sir
mr joy lobo

convocation dates

good news sir
the police and joy father
have no clue
everyone thinks this is suicide
the post mortem report -
cause of death intense
pressure on windpipe
resulting in choking
all think the pressure
on the jugular killed him
what about the mental pressure
for the last four years
that missing in the report
engineers are a clever bunch
they havent made a machine
to measure mental pressure
if they had all would know
this isnt suicide it murder
how dare you blame me
for joy suicide
if one student cant handle
pressure is it our fault
life is full of pressures
will you always blame others
i dont blame you sir
i blame the system
look at these statistics -
india ranks no  in suicides
every 90 minutes
a student attempts suicide
suicide is a bigger killer
than disease
something terribly wrong sir
i cant speak for the rest
but this is one of the
finest colleges in the country
ive run this place for 32 years
we were ranked 28th
now were no
what the point sir
here they dont discuss
new ideas or inventions
they discuss grades
jobs settling in the usa
they teach how to get good scores
they dont teach engineering
now you will teach me
how to teach
no sir i
sir my paper
vaidyanathan please sit down
here is a
self-proclaimed professor
who thinks he is better than
our highly qualified teachers
professor ranchhoddas chanchad
will teach us engineering
we do not have all day
you have 30 seconds
to define these terms
you may refer to your books
raise your hand
if you get the answer
let see who comes first
who comes last
your time starts now
time up
time up sir
no one got the answer
now rewind your life by a minute
when i asked this question
were you excited curious
thrilled that youd learn
something new
anyone sir
no you all got into a frantic race
what the use of such methods
even if you come first
will your knowledge increase
no just the pressure
this is a college
not a pressure cooker
even a circus lion learns to sit
on a chair in fear of the whip
but you call such a lion
well trained not well educated
hello
this is not a philosophy class
just explain those two words
sir these words dont exist
these are my friends names
farhan and raju
quiet
nonsense is this how
youll teach engineering
sir i wasnt teaching
you engineering
youre an expert at that
i was teaching you how to teach
and im sure one day youll learn
because unlike you i never
abandon my weak students
bye sir
quiet
quiet i said
i regret to inform you
that your son
farhan raju
has fallen into bad company
without urgent corrective steps
his future will be ruined
virus letters dropped on
our homes like atom bombs
hiroshima and nagasaki
plunged into gloom
our parents invited us -
for a dressing down
come in
see that
we could afford
just one air-conditioner
we put it in farhan room
so he could study in comfort
i didnt buy a car
i manage with a scooter
we put all our money
into farhan education
we sacrificed our comforts
for farhan future understand
you took these pictures farhan
he had that useless
obsession for a while
went around taking
pictures of animals
wanted to be a
wildlife photographer
son what was your
score that year
9%
hear that straight drop
from 94% to 9%
you find it funny
no sir sorry im just
amazed at the photos
why make him an engineer
why not a wildlife photographer
enough
i humbly request you -
dont ruin my son future
food on the table boys cmon
if you ever visit again
do eat with us
dad denied us a meal
so to fill our bellies with food
and ears with more reprimands
we reached raju house
raju house was straight
out of a 50 black and white film
a small dingy room
a paralyzed father
a coughing mother
and an unwed sister
a sofa sprouting springs
a 24 hour water supply -
from the leaking roof
mother was a retired school
teacher and a tireless complainer
father was once a postmaster
paralysis shut down
his body partly
his salary completely
and the sister
kammo turned 28
they demand a car in dowry
if you dont study and earn
how will she marry
some okra
okra is now 2rs per kilo

warnings from your college
mom
cottage cheese
cottage cheese should be sold
at the jewelers in velvet pouches
cottage cheese no no it ok
mom please
alright ill shut up
earn for the family
slave like a maid
and then take the vow of silence
if not with my son with whom
do i share my woes his friends
hey raju
we were in a huge dilemma
do we comfort our friend
or console his mom
screw it we thought let
focus on the cottage cheese
even his eczema cream
costs 55rs now

okra for 2rs

and it still a sizable income
but erase another zero
and i would worry a little
isnt that your fathers income
farhan
yes sir
now take away another zero
and that your family income
raju rastogi
big reason to worry
take my advice and shift into
chatur ramalingam room
exams are here stay with
rancho and youre sure to fail
want a shave
no sir
then get lost
raju dont worry this is virus
move to split us divide and rule
i have to worry
he grades us and i need
good grades for a good job
unlike you i dont have a
rich dad i can live off
shut up raju
must we follow all his hogwash
aal izz well
i wont be his flunky like you
youre crossing the line
no im drawing one
i have a family to support
dad medicines
swallow up mom pension
my sis cant marry because
they want a car in dowry
mom hasnt bought a
single saree in five years
now dont get your mom
wardrobe into the debate
by the way how many sarees
per annum is reasonable
hey no wisecracks about mom
well study with all our heart
but not just for grades
to quote a wise one study
to be accomplished not affluent
follow excellence and success
will chase you pants down
which wise one says this
his holiness guru ranchhoddas
go rot in the bogs
raju dont stress well top
our class nothing is impossible
oh yeah
shove this back into the tube
raju got onto another train
his travails with chatur began
yes i mean travails not travels
chatur was called ilencer
to sharpen his memory
he popped pills from a local quack
and then let off silent
but lethal farts
i didnt do it raju
he always blamed others
for the output
silencer crammed 8 hours a day
on exam eve
he would distract others
his belief there are only
two ways of topping
elevate your own grades or
shrink your opponents grades
rancho decided to subdue
silencer and rescue raju
with one master plan
our director has unceasingly
served erved means
damn the meaning
ill memorize it
chatur was the introductory speaker
at the teachers day function
to impress virus he got his
speech written by the librarian
in highbrow hindi
hello hold on
chatur call for you
please collect the printout
ill be right back
oh the things i have to do
mr dubey the director was
remembering you
really
yes just now
ill see him right away
give this to chatur
hello hello
hello mr ramalingam
yes
im calling from the police station
are you from uganda
yes sir
your life is in danger
what how
listen carefully or else
youll get killed as you step out
of the college gate
why what happened
while chatur was kept engaged
rancho altered a few words
in his speech for example
erved became crewed
yes sir
who are you
dubey librarian
im permanent staff sir
congratulations
hold on a moment
the chief is on the other line
excuse me sir
yes so where was i
you said i may die
outside the gate
right as you get out of the gate
youll see a traffic signal
traffic signal ok
when it turns red
all the cars will halt
ok then
then cross the road
with great caution
because son in rush hour
if a car hits you youre dead
what nonsense i know that
you know that excellent
then youre safe my boy
from the librarian silencer
you dont call me that chanchad
hey the director said
he didnt call for me
who said called
i just said he remembered you
remembered rascals
distinguished mr chairperson
chief guest the honorable
minister of education
respected teachers and friends
ice has now soared
beyond the stratosphere
the credit goes solely to
dr viru sahastrabuddhe
give him a big hand
sir the voice is his
but the words are mine
he a great guy really you are
for 32 years he has
unceasingly screwed students
he means erved students
im sure his endeavors
will continue
we are astounded at
how one man in one lifetime
can screw so many so well
with rigorous training
he built up his stamina
he spent every living minute
just screwing
let replicate his methods
tomorrow ice students
will go across the globe
wherever we go
we promise to screw
well hoist this screwer flag
all over the world
well show the world that
our capacity to screw
cannot be matched by any student
anywhere on the planet
mr minister good evening
you have given this institution
what it sorely needs
booty funds bosom
it booty stupid bosom means
what nonsense that insulting
everyone has a bosom
but it remains pocketed
no one offers it so readily
vulgar fellow
you have generously offered
your bosom
to this relentless screwer
now see how he makes it grow
is this what you teach here director
on this august occasion
here a sanskrit verse
listen to this the might
of his fart in verse
a good loud fart is honorable
fart go silencer
a medium fart is tolerable
softer windbreaks are terrible
and the silent ones unbearable
that what mindless cramming
does to you
cramming may see you
through four years of college
but it will crew you
for the next 40 years
he still doesnt get it
medium fart is tolerable
unbelievable
youre a poet rancho
how did you think of this
that was fun
he didnt know what hit him
you swines
what did i ever do to you
sorry man
dont take it personally
i will
chatur ramalingam
will never forget this insult
ill think of it every minute
every second of my life
sorry man that was a demo
for raju dont cram blindly
understand and enjoy
the wonders of science
im not here to enjoy science
so youre here to screw science
go ahead laugh at my methods
but one day these methods
will bring me success
that day ill laugh and youll cry
youre on the wrong track again
dont chase success
become a good engineer
and success will chase you
these ideals dont work
in the real world
you take your train ill take mine
ten years from now
well meet at the same station
same day same place
well see who more successful
you or i
have the balls cmon bet
it a challenge

a shooting star skips along
crooning a ballad of love
the night is bright but lonesome

but we continued writing
he continued arranging
the answer sheets
done sir

sir do you know who we are
prime ministers son even then
i will not accept your paper
do you know

rancho

my heart sank
not cause our ranks tanked
but cause our friend flunked
there a mistake
it not possible it injustice
what silencer howling about
he got the second rank
who first
rancho
rancho
move aside
we learned a lesson
in human behavior
your friend fails you feel bad
your friend tops you feel worse
we were sad
two others were sadder
ranchhoddas chanchad
front row right of the director
uday sinha second row third seat
alok mittal second row fifth seat
sahili rao third row
sir why this seating
according to rank
any problem with that
yes this grading system is
like a caste system
a-graders masters
c-graders slaves
it not nice sir
you have a better idea
yes results should not be
displayed at all
why publicize someone flaws
if your iron count is low
will the doctor prescribe tonic
or air your report on tv
you see sir
so basically
what you are saying is
i should personally go to
each student room
and whisper in his ears
you have come first;
youre second;
oh im so sorry
you have failed
no sir i mean
grades create a divide
ive topped so im next to you
my pals came last
theyre in the back corner
at least theyre in the corner
more time with you and
theyll be out of the photo
they will neither pass
nor get a job
theyll get jobs sir
there must be some firm that
prefers humans to machines
theyll get jobs i guarantee
you guarantee it
bet sir
govind yes sir
