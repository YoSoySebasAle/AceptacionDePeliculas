there was me

and my three droogs
that is pete georgie and dim

korova milk bar
trying to make up
our rassoodocks
what to do with the evening
the korova milk bar sold milk plus
milk plus vellocet or
synthemesc or drencrom
which is what we were drinking
this would sharpen you up
and make you ready for a bit
of the old ultra-violence
one thing i could never stand
was to see a filthy
dirty old drunkie
howling away at the
filthy songs of his fathers
and going blerp blerp
in between
as it might be a filthy old
orchestra in his stinking guts
i could never stand to see anyone
like that whatever his age
but more especially when he
was real old like this one was
can you spare some cutter
me brothers

you bastard cowards
i dont want to live anyway
not in a stinking world
like this

there no law and order anymore
it stinks because it lets
the young get onto the old
like you done
it no world
for an old man any longer
what kind of a world is it
at all
men on the moon
men spinning around the earth
and there not no
attention paid
to earthly
law and order no more

travelers of the night
playing hogs of the road
then we headed west

and good for laughs and
lashing of the old ultra-violent
who on earth could that be

we were all feeling a bit
shagged and fagged and fashed
it having been an evening
of some small energy expenditure
so we got rid of the auto
and stopped at the korova
for a nightcap
hello lucy
had a busy night
weve been working hard too
pardon me luce
there was some sophistos from
the tv studios around the corner
laughing and govoreeting
the devotchka smeched away
not caring about
the wicked world one bit
then the disk on the stereo
twanged off and out
and in the short silence
before the next one came on
she suddenly came
with a burst of singing
and it was like
for a moment my brothers
some great bird
had flown into the milk bar
and i felt all the malenky
little hairs on my plott
standing endwise
and the shivers crawling up
like slow malenky lizards
and then down again
because i knew what she sang
it was a bit from
the glorious 9th by ludwig van
what did you do that for
for being a bastard
with no manners
without a dook of an idea about how
to comport yourself public-wise
i dont like you should
do what you done

where i lived was with
my dada and mum
in municipal flat block
8-a linear north
it had been a wonderful evening
and what i needed now
to give it the perfect ending
was a bit
of the old ludwig van
oh bliss
bliss and heaven
it was gorgeousness and
gorgeosity made flesh
it was like a bird
of rarest spun heaven metal
or like silvery wine
flowing in a spaceship
gravity all nonsense now

of speech from your
post-corrective advisor to you
that you watch out little alex
because next time it not

and all my work ruined
if youve no respect
for yourself
you at least might have some
for me who sweated over you

a confession of failure
for every one of you
who ends up in the stripy hole
ive been doing nothing i shouldnt
the millicents have nothing
on me brother
sir i mean
cut out this clever
talk about millicents
just because the police
havent picked you up
doesnt mean that youve not
been up to some nastiness
there was a bit
of nastiness last night
some very extreme nastiness yes
a few of a certain billy-boy
friends were ambulanced off late
your name was mentioned
the words got to me
by the usual channels
certain friends of yours
were named also
nobody can prove anything
about anybody as usual
im warning you little alex

to you as always
the one man in this
sore and sick community
who wants to save you
from yourself
what gets into you all
weve been studying the problem
for damn well near a century
but we get no farther
with our studies
you got a good home here
good loving parents
youve got not too bad of a brain
is it some devil
that crawls inside of you
nobody got anything on me
i been out of the millicents
rookers for a long time
that just what worries me
a bit too long to be safe
youre about due by my reckoning
that why im warning you
to keep your handsome
young proboscis out of the dirt

of deepest summer

there we were waiting and
drinking at the old knifey moloko
and you had not turned up
and we thought
you might have been like
offended by something
or other
so around we come to your abode
appy polly loggies
i had something of a pain
in the gulliver so i had to sleep
i was not awakened
when i gave orders for wakening
sorry about the pain
using the gulliver
too much-like maybe
giving orders and
discipline and such perhaps
you sure the pain is gone
you sure youd not
be happier back in bed
let get things nice
and sparkling clear
this sarcasm
if i may call it such
does not become you
my little brothers
as i am your droog and leader

what goes on
yeah

what does that great big
horsey gape of a grin portend

that part of the new way

what this about a new way
there been some very large talk
behind my sleeping back and no error
if you must have it

we go around shop crasting
and the like
coming out with a pitiful
rookerfull of money each
and will the english
in the coffee mesto
saying he can fence anything
any malchick tries to crast
the shiny stuff the ice
the big big money available
is what will the english says
big big money

would you not say
something to sharpen us up
some of them moloko plus
you especially
we have the start
yeah we got a start on you
yeah moloko plus eh
as we walked along
the flatblock marina
i was calm on the outside
but thinking all the time
so now it was to be
georgie the general
saying what we should do
and what not to do
and dim as his mindless
grinning bulldog
but suddenly i viddied that
thinking was for the gloopy ones
and that the oomny ones
used like
inspiration and what bog sends
for now it was lovely music
that came to my aid
there was a window open
with a stereo on
and i viddied right at once
what to do
i had not cut into any
of dim main cables
and so with the help
of a clean tashtook
the red red kroovy
soon stopped
and it did not take long to
quieten the two wounded soldiers
down in the snug
of the duke of new york
now they knew who was
master and leader
sheep thought i
but a real leader knows
always when like
to give and show generous
to his unders
well
now were back to where we were
yes
just like before
and all forgotten
right right right

tragic part of the story beginning
o my brothers and only friends
after a trial
with judges and a jury
and hard words spoken against
your friend and humble narrator
he was sentenced to 4 years
in staja number 84-f
among smelly perverts
and hardened prestoopniks
the shock sending my dada beating
his bruised and krovvy rookers

or are you going to attend
to the divine word
and realize the punishments
that await unrepentant sinners
in the next world
as well as this
a lot of idiots you are
selling your birthright
for a saucer of cold porridge
the thrill of theft
of violence the urge to live easy
well i ask you what is it worth
when we have undeniable proof
yes incontrovertible
evidence
that hell exists
i know
i know my friends
i have been informed
in visions
that there is a place
darker than any prison
hotter than any flame
of human fire
where souls
of unrepentant criminal sinners
like yourselves--
dont you laugh damn you
dont you laugh
i say like yourselves
scream
in endless and
unendurable agony
their skin
rotting and peeling
a fireball
spinning in their
screaming guts
i know yes i know
quiet all right you lot
well end by singing hymn 258
in the prisoner hymnal
and let have a little reverence
you bastards
come on sing up damn you
louder
louder
it had not been edifying
indeed not
being in this hellhole
and human zoo for two years now
being kicked and tolchoked
by brutal warders
and meeting leering criminals
and perverts
ready to dribble all over
a luscious young malchick
like your storyteller
it was my rabbit
to help the prison charlie
with the sunday service
he was a bolshy
great burly bastard
but he was very fond of myself
me being very young
and also now very interested
in the big book
move along there
move along
move along there
move along
i read all about the scourging
and the crowning with thorns
and i could viddy myself
helping in
and even taking charge of
the tolchoking and the nailing in
being dressed in the height
of roman fashion
i didnt so much like
the latter part of the book
which is more like
all preachy talking
than fighting
and the old in-out
i like the parts where these old
yahoodies tolchok each other
and then drink
their hebrew vino
and getting onto the bed
with their wives handmaidens
that kept me going
seek not to be like evil men
neither desire to be with them
because their minds
studieth robberies
and their lips speak deceits
if thou lose hope being weary
in the days of distress
thy strength
shall be diminished
fine my son fine
father
i have tried have i not
you have my son
ive done my best have i not
indeed
ive never been guilty of any
institutional infraction have i
you certainly have not 65532
youve been very helpful
and youve shown
a genuine desire to reform
father
can i ask you
a question in private
certainly my son certainly
is there something
troubling you my son
dont be shy to speak up
remember
i know of the
urges that can
trouble young men
deprived
of the society of women
oh father
it nothing like that father
it about this new thing
theyre all talking about
about this new treatment
it gets you out of prison
in no time
and makes sure you
never get back in again
where did you hear about this
who been talking
about these things
these things get around
two warders talk as it might be
and somebody cant help
overhearing what they say
then somebody picks up a scrap
of newspaper in the workshops
and the newspaper
tells all about it
how about putting me in
for this new treatment
i take it
you are referring
to the ludovico technique
i dont know what it called
i just know it
gets you out quickly
and makes sure you
never get back in again
that is not proven 65532
in fact it is only in the
experimental stage at this moment
it is being used isnt it father
it has not been used
in this prison yet
the governor has grave
doubts about it
and ive heard there are
very serious dangers involved
i dont care about the dangers
i just want to be good
i want for the rest
of my life to be
one act of goodness
the question is
whether or not this technique
really makes a man good
goodness comes from within
goodness
is chosen
when a man cannot choose
he ceases to be a man
i dont understand
about the whys and wherefores
i only know i want to be good
be patient my son
put your trust in the lord
instruct thy son
and he shall refresh thee
and shall give delight
to thy soul
amen
mister
all present and correct sir
right
all present and correct
prisoners halt
now pay attention
i want you in two lines
up against that wall
facing this way
go on move
hurry up
stop talking
prisoners ready
for inspection sir
how many to a cell
four in this block sir
cram criminals together
and what do you get
concentrated criminality
crime in the midst of punishment
i agree sir we need
larger prisons more money
not a chance my dear fellow
the government cant be
concerned any longer
with outmoded
penalogical theories
soon we may need all prison
space for political offenders
common criminals are best dealt
with on a purely curative basis
kill the criminal reflex
that all
full implementation
in a year time
punishment means nothing to them
they enjoy their
so-called punishment
youre absolutely right sir
shut your bleeding hole
who said that
i did sir
what crime did you commit
the accidental killing
of a person sir
he brutally murdered a woman
in furtherance of theft
fourteen years sir
excellent
he enterprising
aggressive
outgoing
young bold
vicious
hell do
fine
we could still look at c-block
no no that enough
he perfect
i want his records sent to me
this vicious young hoodlum
will be transformed
out of all recognition
thank you very much
for this chance
let hope you make
the most of it my boy
shall we go to my office
thank you
come in
sir 65532 sir
very good chief
over to the line
toes behind it
full name and number
to the governor
alexander delarge sir
65532 sir
i dont suppose you know who
that was this morning
that was no less a personage
than the minister of the interior
the new minister of the interior
what they call a very new broom
these new ridiculous ideas
have come at last
and orders are orders
though i may say to you
in confidence i do not approve
an eye for an eye i say
if someone hits you
you hit back do you not
why should not the state
severely hit by you hooligans
not hit back also
the new view is to say no
the new view is that
we turn the bad into good
all of which seems to me
to be grossly unjust
sir i--
shut your filthy hole you scum
you are to be reformed
tomorrow you will go
to this man brodsky
you will be leaving here
you will be transferred to
the ludovico medical facility
it believed youll be able
to leave state custody
in a fortnight
i suppose that prospect
pleases you
answer the governor question
yes sir
thank you very much
ive done my best here
i really have sir
im very grateful
to all concerned sir
sign this where it marked
dont read it sign it
it says youre willing to have
your sentence commuted
to submission to
the ludovico treatment
and this
and another copy
the next morning i was taken to
the ludovico medical facility
outside the town center
i felt a malenky bit sad
having to say goodbye
to the old staja
as you will when you leave
a place youve gotten used to
right hold the prisoner
good morning sir
im chief officer barnes
ive got 65532
on a transfer from parkmoor
to the ludovico centre sir
good morning
yes weve been expecting you
im dr alcot
dr alcot very good sir
are you prepared for the prisoner
yes of course
i wonder if youd mind signing
these documents sir
there sir
and there sir
and there
here you go
there you are
prison escort move forward
halt
excuse me sir
is that the officer that is
to take charge of the prisoner
a word of advice doc
youll have to watch this one
a right brutal bastard he has been
and will be again
in spite of all his sucking up
and reading the bible
we can manage things
show the young man to his room
right sir come this way please

that good i like to viddy
the old films now and again
and viddy films i would
where i was taken to brothers
was like no cine
i ever viddied before
i was bound up
in a straitjacket
and my gulliver was strapped
to a headrest
with wires running away from it
then they clamped like
lid-locks on me eyes
so that i could not shut them
no matter how hard i tried
it seemed a bit crazy to me
but i let them get on with
what they wanted to get on with
if i was to be a free malchick
again in a fortnight
i would put up with much
in the meantime my brothers
the first film was a very good
professional piece of cine
like it was done in hollywood
the sounds were real horrorshow
you could slooshy the screams
and moans very realistic
you could even get
the breathing and panting
of the tolchocking malchicks
at the same time
and then what do you know
soon our dear old friend
the red red vino on tap
the same in all places
like it put out
by the same firm
began to flow
it was beautiful
it funny how the colors
of the real world
only seem really real
when you viddy them
on a screen
now all the time
i was watching this
i was beginning
to get very aware
of like not feeling
all that well
and this i put down
to all the rich food and vitamins
but i tried to forget this
concentrating on the next film
which jumped right away
on a young devotchka
who was being given
the old in-out in-out
first by one malchick
then another
then another
when it came to
the 6th or 7th malchick
leering and smecking
and then going into it
i began to feel really sick
but i could not shut me glazzies
and even if i tried to move
my glazzballs about
i still could not get out of
the line of fire
of this picture
get me up
im going to be sick
get something for me to be sick in
very soon now
the drug will cause the subject
to experience
a deathlike paralysis
together with deep feelings
of terror and helplessness
i cant stand it anymore
one of our early test subjects
described it as being like death
a sense of stifling or drowning
and it is during this period
we have found
the subject will make
his most rewarding associations
between his catastrophic
experience environment
and the violence he sees
leave me glazzies
dr brodsky is pleased with you
youve made
a very positive response
tomorrow there will be two
sessions morning and afternoon
you mean i have to viddy
two sessions in one day
i imagine youll feel a bit
limp by the end of the day
but we have to be hard on you
you have to be cured
it was horrible
of course it was horrible
violence is a very horrible thing
that what youre learning now
your body learning it
i just dont understand about
feeling sick the way i did
i never used to feel sick
i used to feel the very opposite
doing it or watching it
i used to feel real horrorshow
you felt ill this afternoon
because youre getting better
when were healthy
we respond to the hateful
with fear and nausea
youre becoming healthy
that all
by this time tomorrow
youll be healthier still
it was the next day brothers
and i had truly done my best
morning and afternoon
to play it their way
and sit like a horrorshow
cooperative malchick
in the chair of torture
while they flashed nasty bits
of ultra-violence on the screen
though not on the soundtrack
the only sound being music
then i noticed
in all my pain and sickness
what music it was
that like cracked and boomed
it was ludwig van
ninth symphony
fourth movement
ah
ah
ah ah
no no
stop it stop it
please i beg you
it a sin
it a sin
it a sin
it a sin it a sin it a sin
sin
what all this about sin
that using ludwig van like that
he did no harm to anyone
beethoven just wrote music
are you referring
to the background score
yes
youve heard beethoven before
yes
so youre keen on music
yes
cant be helped
here the punishment
element perhaps
the governor ought to be pleased
im sorry alex
this is for your own good
youll have to bear with us
for a while
but it not fair it not fair
i should feel ill when i hear
lovely lovely ludwig van
you must take your chance boy
the choice has been all yours
you neednt take it
any further sir
youve proved to me all this
ultra-violence and killing
is wrong wrong
and terribly wrong
ive learned me lesson sir
i see now what ive
never seen before
im cured praise god
youre not cured yet boy
but sirs
missus
i see that it wrong
it wrong because
it like against society
because everybody has the
right to live and be happy
without being
tolchocked and knifed
no no boy
you really must leave it to us
but be cheerful about it
in less than a fortnight now
youll be a free man
ladies and gentlemen
at this stage we introduce
the subject himself
he is as you will perceive
fit and well-nourished
he comes straight from a night
sleep and a good breakfast
undrugged
unhypnotized
tomorrow we send him out with
confidence into the world again
as decent a lad as you
would meet on a may morning
what a change is here
ladies and gentlemen
from the hoodlum
the state committed
to unprofitable punishment
some two years ago
unchanged after two years
unchanged do i say
not quite
prison taught him the false smile
the rubbed hands of hypocrisy
the fawning greased
obsequious leer
other vices it taught him
as well as confirming him in
those he had long practiced before
our party promised
to restore law and order
and to make the streets safe for
the ordinary peace-loving citizen
this pledge is now
about to become a reality
ladies and gentlemen
today is an historic moment
the problem of criminal violence
is soon to be a thing of the past
but enough of words
actions speak louder than
action now
observe all
our necks are out
a long way on this minister
i have complete faith in brodsky
if the polls are right
we have nothing to lose
hello heap of dirt
ew you dont wash much do you
judging by the horrible smell
why do you say that
i had a shower this morning
he had a shower this morning
you trying to call me a liar
no brother
you must think im awfully stupid
why did you do that brother
ive never done wrong to you
you want to know why i did that
well you see
i do this
ah
and that
and this because i dont like
your horrible type do i
and if you want
to start something
you just go ahead go on
please do
im going to be sick im going to be sick
youre going to be sick are you
im going to be sick
please let me get up
you want to get up
well now you listen to me
if you want to get up
youve got to
do something for me
here
here
you see that
you see that shoe
i want you to lick it
go on
lick it
and o my brothers
would you believe
your faithful friend
and long-suffering narrator
pushed out his red yabzick
a mile and a half
to lick the grahzny
vonny boots
and again
the horrible killing sickness
had whooshed up
and turned the joy of battle
into a feeling
i was going to snuff it
and again
nice and clean
thank you very much
that will do very well
thank you very much
ladies and gentlemen
thank you very much
thank you very much
she came towards me
with the light like it was the
light light of heavenly grace
and the thing that flashed
in me gulliver
was that id like to have her
there on the floor
with the old in-out
real savage
but quick as a shot
came the sickness
like a detective whod been
watching around the corner
and now followed
to make his arrest
enough thank you very much
thank you my dear
thank you very much
not feeling too bad now are you
no sir
i feel really great sir
good
was it all right sir
did i do well
fine my boy absolutely fine
you see ladies and gentlemen
our subject is impelled
towards the good
by paradoxically
being impelled towards evil
the intention to act violently
is accompanied by strong
feelings of physical distress
to counter these
the subject has to switch
to a diametrically
opposed attitude
any questions
choice
the boy has no real choice has he
self-interest
the fear of physical pain
drove him to that
grotesque act of self-abasement
its insincerity
was clearly to be seen
he ceases to be a wrongdoer
he ceases also to be
a creature capable of moral choice
padre these are subtleties
were not concerned with motives
with the higher ethics
we are concerned only
with cutting down crime
and with relieving the
ghastly congestion in our prison
he will be your true christian
ready to turn the other cheek
ready to be crucified
rather than crucify
sick to the very heart at the
thought even of killing a fly
reclamation
joy before the angels of god
the point is that it works
and the very next day
your friend and humble narrator
was a free man
son
hi hi hi there my pee and em

i came to brothers
not realizing
in the state i was in
where i was
and had been before
who on earth could that be
ill see who it is
yes what is it
please
frank i think this young man
needs some help
my god
what happened to you my boy
and would you believe it
o my brothers and only friends
there was your
faithful narrator
being held helpless
like a babe in arms
and suddenly realizing
where he was
and why home on the gate
had looked so familiar
but i knew i was safe
i knew he would not remember me
for in those carefree days
i and my so-called droogs
wore our maskies which were
like real horrorshow disguises
police
ghastly horrible police
they beat me up sir
the police beat me up
i know you
isnt it your picture
in the newspapers
didnt i see you
on the video this morning
are you not the poor victim
of this horrible new technique
yes sir
that exactly who i am and
what i am sir a victim
then by god youve been
sent here by providence
tortured in prison then thrown out
to be tortured by the police
my heart goes out to you poor poor boy
youre not the first to come here
the police like to bring
their victims to this village
but it providential that you
who are also another kind
of victim should come here
but youre cold and shivering
julian
draw a bath for this young man
certainly frank
thank you very much
god bless you
he can be the most potent
weapon imaginable
to ensure the government
is not returned in the election
the government big boast sir
is the way they have
dealt with crime
recruiting young roughs
into the police
proposing will-sapping
techniques of conditioning
weve seen it before
in other countries
the thin end of the wedge
before we know it well have the
full apparatus of totalitarianism
this young boy is a living witness
to these diabolical proposals
the people the common people
must know must see
there are traditions of liberty to defend
the tradition of liberty is all
the common people
will let it go yes
theyll sell liberty
for a quieter life
that is why they must be led
driven pushed
fine
thank you very much sir
hell be here
im singing in the rain
just singing in the rain
what a glorious feeling
im happy again
im laughing at clouds
so dark up above
the sun in my heart
and im ready for love
let the stormy clouds chase
everyone from the place
come on with the rain
ive a smile on my face
ill walk down the lane
to a happy refrain
and im singing
in the rain
good evening sir

my wife
used to do everything for me
and leave me to my writing
your wife is she away
no she dead
im sorry to hear about that
she was very badly raped you see
we were assaulted by
vicious young hoodlums
in this very room
youre sitting in now
i was left a helpless cripple but
for her the agony was too great
the doctors said
it was pneumonia
because it happened later
during a flu epidemic
the doctors told me it was
pneumonia but i knew what it was
a victim of the modern age
poor poor girl
and now you
another victim of the modern age
but you can be helped
i phoned some friends while
you were having your bath
some friends sir
yes they want to help you
help me
help you
who are they sir
very very important people
and theyre interested in you
julian
thisll be these people now
i dont want to trouble you
any further i should be leaving
no no no my boy no trouble at all
here
let me fill your glass
hello frank
good evening sir
hello frank
so this is the young man
how do you do sir
hello
missus
im very pleased to meet you
i hope you forgive us for coming
at this hour
but we heard you
were in trouble
and so we came over to see
if we could help
very kind of you sir
thank you very much
i understand you had a rather
unfortunate
encounter
with the police tonight
yes i suppose
you could call it that
how are you feeling now
much better thank you
feel like talking
answering a few questions
fine sir fine
as i said weve heard about you
we are interested in your case
we want to help you
thank you very much
shall we get down to it
fine fine sir
the newspapers mentioned
that in addition to your being
conditioned against
acts of sex and violence
youve inadvertently been
conditioned against music
i think that was something
that they didnt plan for
you see missus
im very fond of music
especially beethoven
ludwig van beethoven
b-e--
it all right thank you
and it just so happened that
while they were showing me
a particularly bad film
of like a concentration camp
the background music
was playing beethoven
so now you have
the same reaction to music
as you do to sex and violence
no missus you see it not
all music it just the 9th
you mean beethoven 9th symphony
that right i cant listen
to the 9th anymore at all
when i hear the 9th i get like
this funny feeling
and then all i can think about
is like trying to snuff it
i beg your pardon
snuff it death i mean
i just want to die peacefully
like with no pain
do you feel that way now
no sir not exactly
i still feel
very miserable
very much down in spirits
do you still feel
suicidal
put it this way
i feel very low in meself
i cant see much in the future
i feel that any second something
terrible is going to happen to me
well done frank
julian get the car would you please
i woke up
the pain and sickness
all over me like an animal
then i realized what it was
the music coming up
from the floor
was our old friend
ludwig van
and the dreaded 9th symphony
let me out
open the door
come on open the door
ah turn it off
turn it off
turn it off
turn it off
turn it off
stop it
turn it off
turn it off
turn it off
turn it off
turn it off
turn it off
turn it off
please turn it off
suddenly i viddied
what i had to do
and what i had wanted to do
and that was to do myself in
to snuff it
to blast off forever
out of this wicked cruel world
one moment of pain perhaps
and then sleep
forever and ever
and ever
ah
i jumped o my brothers
and i fell hard
but i did not snuff it
if i had snuffed it
i would not be here
to tell what i told have
i came back to life
after a long black black gap
of what might have been
a million years
oh
he recovered
consciousness doctor
hello lad
hello son
how are you
you feeling better
what
gives
o my pee and em
what makes
you think you are welcome
there there mother
it all right
he doesnt mean it
you were in the papers again son
it said
they had done
great wrong to you
it said
how the government
drove you to try
and do yourself in
and when you think about it son
maybe it was our fault too
in a way
your home your home
when all said and done son
good morning
good morning doctor
good morning
good morning missis
how are you feeling today
fine
good may i
im dr taylor
havent seen you before
im your psychiatrist
psychiatrist
do i need one
just part of hospital routine
are we going to
talk about me sex life
oh no
im going to show you
some slides
and youre going to tell me
what you think about them
jolly good
you know anything about dreams
something yes
you know what they mean
perhaps
you concerned about something
no not concerned really
but ive been having
this nasty dream
very nasty
it like
well when i was all smashed up
you know
and half-awake
and unconscious-like
i kept having this dream
all these doctors were
playing around with me gulliver
you know like the inside
of me brain
i seem to have this dream
over and over again
do you think it means anything
patients with injuries like yours
often have dreams of this sort
it all part of the recovery process
oh
now then each of these slides
needs a reply
from one of the people
in the picture
you tell me what you think
the person would say all right
righty-right
isnt the plumage beautiful
i just say what the other person would say
yes
isnt the plumage beautiful
dont think about it too long
say the first thing
that pops into your mind
cabbages knickers
it not got a beak
good
the boy you always
quarreled with is seriously ill
my mind is a blank
and ill smash your face
for you yarblockos
good
what do you want
no time for the old in-out love
ive just come to read the meter
good
you sold me a crummy
watch i want my money back
you know what you can do with
that watch stick it up your ass
good
you can do
whatever you like with these
eggiwegs
i would like
to smash them
and pick them all up
and throw-ow
fucking hell
there that all there is to it
are you all right
hope so
is that the end then
i was quite enjoying that
good im glad
how many did i get right
it not that kind of a test
but you seem well on the way
to making a complete recovery
when do i get out then
im sure it wont be long now
so i waited
and o my brothers
i got a lot better
munching away at eggiwegs
and lomticks of toast
and lovely steakie-wakes
and then one day
they said i was going to have
a very special visitor
just wait outside for
a moment would you officer
im afraid my change
of schedule has thrown you
the patient in the middle
of supper
that quite all right
minister no trouble at all
good evening my boy
hi there my little droogies
howre you getting on young man
great sir just great
can i do anything more for you
i dont think so sir leslie
then i leave you to it nurse
you seem to have a whole ward
to yourself my boy
yes sir
and a very lonely place
it is too
when i wake up in the night
with me pain
yes anyway good to see you
on the mend
i kept in touch
with the hospital of course
and now ive come down
personally
to see how youre getting along
ive suffered the tortures
of the damned
tortures of the damned
yes i can appreciate that
youve had an extremely--
oh look let me help you
with that shall i
thank you sir thank you
i can tell you that i and the
government of which im a member
are deeply sorry about this
my boy deeply sorry
we tried to help you
we followed recommendations
that turned out to be wrong
an inquiry will place the
responsibility where it belongs
we want you to regard us
as friends
we put you right
youre getting
the best of treatment
we never wished you harm
but there are some who did and do
and i think you know who those are
there are certain people who wanted
to use you for political ends
they would have been
glad to have you dead
for they thought they could then
blame it on the government
there is also a certain man
a writer of subversive
literature
who has been howling
for your blood
he been mad with desire
to stick a knife into you
but youre safe from him now
we put him away
he found out that you
had done wrong to him
at least he believed
you had done wrong
he formed this idea in his head
that you had been responsible
for the death of someone
near and dear to him
he was a menace
we put him away
for his own protection
and also for yours
where is he now
we put him away
where he can do you no harm
you see we are looking
after your interests
we are interested in you
when you leave youll have no
worries well see to everything
a good job on a good salary
what job and how much
youll have an interesting job at
a salary you regard as adequate
not only for the job
youre going to do
and in compensation for what
you believe you have suffered
but also because
you are helping us
helping you
we always help our friends
dont we
it is no secret
that this government
has lost a lot of popularity
because of you my boy
there are some who think that at
the next election we shall be out
the press has chosen to take
a very unfavorable view
of what we tried to do
but public opinion
has a way of changing
and you alex--
if i may call you alex
certainly sir
what do they call you at home
my name is frederick
as i was saying alex
you can be instrumental
in changing the public verdict
do you understand alex
do i make myself clear
as an unmuddied lake fred
as clear as an azure sky
of deepest summer
you can rely on me fred
good
good boy
oh yes i understand youre fond of music
i have arranged a little
surprise for you
surprise
one that i hope
that you will like
as a
how shall we put it
as a symbol of
our new understanding
an understanding
between two friends
i was cured all right
