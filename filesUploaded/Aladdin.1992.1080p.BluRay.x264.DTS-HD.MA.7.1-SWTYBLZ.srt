oh i come from a land
from a faraway place
where the caravan camels roam
where it flat and immense
and the heat is intense
it barbaric but hey it home
when the wind from the east
and the sun from the west
and the sand in the glass is right
come on down stop on by
hop a carpet and fly
to another arabian night
arabian nights
like arabian days
more often than not
are hotter than hot
