the government has moved to lublin
all men must leave the city go across
the river set up a new line of defense

im not going anywhere
good im not going anywhere either
dont be ridiculous
weve got to keep together
look if im going to die i prefer to
die in my own home staying put
god forbid
shut up ive got something listen
from the bbc in london
the british government
having received no reply
to the observations presented
to the german government
has declared war on nazi germany
that wonderful wonderful
it is expected that
within the next few hours france
will make a similar declaration
poland is no longer alone
wonderful wonderful
mama that was a great dinner
it certainly was
when there something to celebrate
youve got to make an effort
here to great britain and france
didnt i tell you didnt i tell you
all will be well
five thousand and three
is that all
yes it all weve got left
it 3003 too much
look
further restrictions
regarding liquid assets
jews will be allowed to keep a
maximum of 2000 zlotys at home
what do we do with the rest
deposit it in a bank blocked account
banks whod be stupid enough
to deposit money in a german bank
we could hide the money look here
we can hide it under the flowerpots
ill tell you what well do
well use try and tested methods
you know what we did
in the last war
we made a hole in the table leg
and hid the money in there
suppose they take the table away
what do you mean
germans go into jewish homes and
take furniture valuables anything
do they
whyd they want a table like this
what on earth are you doing
listen look
this is the best place no-one would
think of looking under the flowerpot
no listen ive been thinking
really that a change
you know what we use psychology
we use what
we leave the money and the watch
on the table covered in full view
are you stupid
the germans will never notice it
that the stupidest thing ive ever
seen of course theyll notice look
look here
idiot
and you call me stupid
very good that the last place
this would take hours
were not in a hurry
it wont take hours
how will you get them out tell me
how will you get them out
quiet order please
you reach them out individually
no-one listens to me
quiet please quiet
order order please
the lawyer she likes order
listen just listen look
the watch we put under the flowerpot
and the money we stuff in the violin
but ill still be able to play
youll find out
jurek it wladek szpilman
wladek how are you
were fine thank you
and you
fine under the circumstances
i guess i know why youre calling
there nothing we can do
they wont reopen the station
yes i know but i
no music no radio for the polish
but sure youll find work
a pianist like you
maybe maybe not but
dont be offended but i didnt call
to discuss my future carrier
i nagged jurek for weeks and weeks
and at last he gave in and said
all right come with me tomorrow
so i came and
they bombed the station
meeting you like that was wonderful
really
yes it was unforgettable
i love your playing mr szpilman
call me wladek please
no-one plays chopin like you
i hope it a compliment
of course i mean it
i was trying to be funny

id like that
and you what do you do
i finished with the conservatoire
youre a musician
yes but only just
what instrument
the cello
i love to see women
playing the cello
jews forbidden

official decree
no jews allowed in the park
my god are you joking

we can just stand here and talk
i think were allowed to do that
so you play the cello that nice
and who your favorite composer
chopin really well
youll have to learn to play
his cello sonata wont you

we know what it means
we sent someone out
zygmund a good man
his orders were to follow
the trains out of warsaw
he got to sokolow
a man told him the tracks divided
one branch leading to treblinka
he said everyday freight trains
carrying people from warsaw
branch off to treblinka
and return empty
no transports of food
are ever seen on that line
the civilians are forbidden
to approach the treblinka station
theyre exterminating us
it wont take them long
we are 60 thousand left
out of half a million
mostly young people
and this time were gonna fight
were in good shape
organized
were prepared

that we like to
to resettle you
i promise you that now
and in the future
nothing else is planned
for this reason we put
information posters on the wall
to show you our goodwill
you should vote one of you
to be allowed
to go in town daily
and bring 3 kilos of potatoes
and one loaf of bread
for each of your workers
so why should we do something
like this if wed resettle you
you can make good business
out of the things you dont eat
isnt that something that you jews
are good in making money
dismiss them
that one with the string
the others tied by wire
