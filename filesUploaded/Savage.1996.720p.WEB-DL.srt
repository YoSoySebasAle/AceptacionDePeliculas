what next is to move
beyond virtual reality
you see the silicon language
limits virtual reality to an
internal experience
exploring our fantasies
but within someone else idea
of a perfect environment
virtual reality is the beginning
of a whole new concept
mr burroughs is
experimenting with a variety
of different drives
worth protecting the
revolutionary virtual
reality machines
but it random you
cant control it youre more
than just a player youre god
now consumers quickly fell
in love with these enormously
entertaining titan games
however teams of highly
skilled engineers and scientists
have failed to duplicate
the technology
the reclusive billionaire
is closely associated
with titan plaza
where burroughs spends
most of his waking hours
the plain of the immortal
kill me
why me why my family

university street looks like
that it im a dead man
paramedics sort
through the carnage
-hell be coming here next
go on what are
you waiting for
make your move ms beloc
we both know youre too smart
to just stick around and wait
for the proverbial shoe to drop
tell you what you just go
to the bathroom well both
pretend youre coming back
relax i never
leave home without it
ok a atypically
candid admission
im a fan youre a master
this guy a master and ive got
the best seat in the house
this is not a game
are you out of your mind
in my games if youre very very
good if youre very very good
you should always be in control
but this is out of hand
i was so close
three or four months
-wait a minute wait a minute
i would have had it
just two or three months
i dont want to overstep
my boundaries here
so maybe if we just
talk this out we can
get a new perspective
talk this what are you
thinking this isnt therapy
this may sound simplistic
but you knew a man would
try to stop you from solving x
that why you hired us
you say you need three or
four months to crack this
the fact that he here now
is an indication that
youre closer to your solution
than you might think
or at least that what they
think
the fuck happened in that bar
mr burroughs wants
his facility locked up airtight
let go
yes sir
there are a dozen
men in the lobby
wait a minute this
guy looks familiar
jesus christ
it the guy from the ranch
yes you idiot
that why you should
have finished him off
now theyre using
his rage as a perfect
tool for my destruction
wait wait wait wait a second
maybe not so perfect
who is that
who
the woman who the woman
itll be on the police report
mr wallace you may
be about to start earning
your christmas bonus
you keep him away
for a few hours
access granted
got it
nicole carter
she a cop
what so special about her
i dont know
but a savage is supposed
to be obsessed with his
quest his calling
he shouldnt
possess any emotions
except for bloodlust and anger
but but he
he saved this woman
therefore he must care for her
which makes him vulnerable
he vulnerable
wallace here yea ok out
morning edgar
sir she just no leaving the
station if you dont mind id
like to handle this personally
fine do it
aw i think you hurt the
big ape feelings
please
please
who is it
who is it
check it out
alright just gonna loosen
the ends here
if you had to break
into this place would you hack
your way through
i could hack my way through
any code in high school
im a real student of cryptology
used to break into nsa files
missile codes fun stuff
precocious
please
may i
please
monitor out on level six
-cro-magnon
yes cro-magnon
our savage forefathers
fifty-thousand years ago
you know you continue
to impress me ms beloc
i dont understand
this is not cro-magnon
oh it absolutely is
i was a member of the original
expedition that found it
the only surviving
member as a matter of fact
the others met with a little
accident on the way home
down there
dent lester clearance two
and these pictographs
symbol cryptography
like the fraternal crypt
used by the rosicrucians
and freemasons
yes only its binary
the cryptographs translate
to key numbers which
translate to cyber text
bur cro-magnon
eden ms beloc mythical eden
all the earth
early cultures
hebrew phoenician
greek goth druid sioux
indian astic scandinavian
they all share the legend
of an extraordinary civilization
unsurpassed in spiritual
and creative genius
which vanished in a
cataclysm a deluge if you will
but that myth
why would every culture come
up with the same myth
pyramids continents apart
in egypt and south
american they bear identical
architectural features
you dont honestly believe
that a primitive people
could construct technological
marvels like easter island
and stone henge
out of sheer primitive
inspiration do you
consider this
geologists estimate
that the end of the last ice age
the one that parted
the straights of gibraltar and
filled the mediterranean basin
at around the same time
as plato and herodotus
approximated the disappearance
of atlantis
another coincidence
read the data
the virtual reality that titan
sells is nothing but a crude
version of this technology
dont you see
the ancient ones
created a virtual universe
an infinite paradise
in cyberspace
but they had to have
food and they needed labor
so they took the apes
down from the trees
our ancestors
they trained them
we are not the children
of gods ms beloc
we are the offspring of apes
im running out of time
what happened to them
with all their technology
surely they could have
survived the cataclysm
well the cataclysm
didnt annihilate them
it merely erased their
fingerprints proof of
their existence
you see theyd reached such
a level of sophistication that
they left the flesh behind
they simply transferred their
essence into cyber space
the way we digitize sound
and light they digitize matter
now they exist in a
cyber universe immortal but
powerless in this world
which is why they sent
the savage to keep me from
deciphering the
key to immortality
dont you see it all about
scaring the apes us
into sheer ignorance
you remember your bible
keep your hands off the fruit
keep your hands off the
fruit of the tree of knowledge
god messing with the
men who dared to erect
the tower of babel
its amazingly
consistent isnt it
knowledge is power
and the key to immortality
is the ultimate power
but why why would
they want to corner the
market on immortality
a cyber universe
ms beloc enough please
the end of our discourse we need
to pursue your solution now
well the first thing we
should consider is all the
binary combinations
that you ran through the
computer about the time that
the savage appeared
good
just one question
what
if i crack this
am i gonna have a
little accident too
yes
force entry zone b
abort
abort
four down three
to go mr rose
can you feed
reese
what
my name
reese good
he in the building
what
he in the building
finish up
looking for me
you are here to kill me right
well you know we better hurry
up to deliver our speeches
you know my diabolical plans
your determination to
keep me from succeeding
blah blah blah
you know what
i say the hell with it
it the 90 let watch tv
mr wallace can you hear me
yea i can hear you
let her go
oh i will
tomorrow maybe the day after
until then you just keep your
distance
oh go on
you can kill me
you can kill me go on
but youll be killing
her too just the way
you were responsible
for the death of
your wife and child
you know we made you
a generous offer on your ranch
a very very generous offer
you want you want
this woman blood
on your hands too
is that what you want hmm
choose

see you around
im going back to type
keep an eye on her
what is taking
wallace so long
how did they
-turn a simple rancher
into a savage
the brain is a computer
ms beloc it operates
on electrical impulses
you press the right buttons
you tap the original hard drive
the cro-magnon programs
the lizard algorithms and voila
access the beast within
beast within sounds good
shh go
get back get back
where is he

two suspects in a black and
white heading west on arroyo

wherever that may be
i want them held until i come
to collect them
my personal responsibility
you got that
the key right here
get in hurry
the fugitives including
officer nicky carter
escaped from titan plaza
in a stolen cruiser
so this was his land
i made him very offer too
an exceptionally good offer
as a matter of fact
through a mining
subsidiary of mine
and the idiot refused to sell
and this is the cave
i presume where you
found the machine
mhmm
well why must
you digitize here
because it a vortex point
it a condenser of
elemental forces like
stonehenge or new grange
or the first temple
at jerusalem
does this sound sort of new
age stupid to you does it
youll soon see
alright lets go come on
look i really am sticking my
neck out for you could you at
least share something with me
simple stuff like your name
who you are what you do
why im stuck in this
fucking car with you
stop that youre
making me crazy here
im not kidding will
you stop that you want
me to pull the car over
sometimes they tell me things
what through the radio
like stairway to heaven played
backwards forget it forget it
tell me about your family
do you have a family
what are you doing
what the hell are you doing
hello
get your hand off the seat
we have to stop for gas
we have no time
yea i know
we also have no gas
sorry fill her up
yea
does the titan corporation
have a place around here
yea about five miles north
of here near the old dig
site next to spirit rock
al
is that you
do you know him
yea you dont
just tell me who he is
he was a rancher he lived
on the road a couple years ago
his whole family was killed
they put him in a crazy place
like a mental hospital
really dont call the cops
i will take care of it ok
i just dont want to
get him upset
put me through to
connie and hurry
is this where you
found it
yes
a cro-magnon cave to
be sure but these
they were obviously ancient
pictographs but there was
something they seemed binary
that amazing
this is just the beginning
sorry
come on let go
no
not until you come clean
what
no wonder you wouldnt
give me a straight answer
hey
your whole family killed
did you kill them
did the radio
voices tell you to
no
when they killed my wife
and my boy nobody helped
and nobody cared except me
you turn your back on
me and im gone
i care
i care i just
hey who do i trust
this is magnificent
what going on
it a generator
it the most powerful
machine ever created
but it takes time to
it takes time to warm up
in about an hour well reach
maximal dimensional thrust
and then
we digitize
a massive tremor rocked
the western united states
scientists are at a loss
to explain what is causing
the worst seismic activity
in the history of
this hemisphere
the quakes seem to be centered
at an area called spirit rock
strangely we have no record
of a fault line in this area
the damage to property
has been tremendous
woah oh my god
everyone hold on
what happening
were tearing
a hole in reality
and reality has mixed
feelings about it
daddy wanna play soldier
welcome home
looks like the place
could use some work
let go come on let
make it interesting bad boy
yea youre not fighting
back huh why not
oh yea you wanna die dont ya
you want me to put you out of
your misery
you want me to do you like i
did your wife i enjoyed that
please
i believe you
get up it not over
power
the power incredible
mr burroughs
reese
maybe we should
stop this is crazy
i mean if we tear a
hole in reality
it will cause so much death
so much destruction
that there will be no
one left to dominate with
our immortality
therell be nothing
left to come back to
come back why
were ascending the heavens
to hell with the apes it just
too bad that the savage will be
too late to save them
hold on
get down
then cover me
what
minorly amusing thought
tell me
i just thought
if you were a cop
wed make good partners
i think wed get along
oh my god go go go
no no
put this on put this on
please be careful
yes ive done it
reese get them away from me
they wont hurt you
theyre powerless in this world
when the digitized
their way to divinity
they triggered a deluge that
almost wiped out the human race
since then whenever
mankind deciphers the universe
most potent secrets
these cyber gods dispatch a
savage to keep us from
destroying ourselves
as if any self respecting
god would give a damn
all exit routes from
manhattan are clogged
as residents try to escape
from the devastation
ruptures in both the
lincoln and holland tunnels
left thousands stranded as
water levels continue to rise
can you hear me
oh god
take care of him
a tremendous fissure
has erupted
open the door
come on marie
life as we know
it is a horror story
the constant fear of
sickness age and death
teeth that rot
a back that cant
bear to stand upright
n-open the door
marie please listen to me
let go of your physical self
let go your body is keeping
your soul from freedom
i like my body reese
i think ill keep it even
if that means ill eventually
rot and die
well then you leave
me no choice
the prime minister has
declared a state of emergency
how stupid
how apelike
history
reese no
it has never been seen before
churches are filled with
panicked citizens
fearing that this is
the final judgement of mankind
if things are true
they may just be right
buildings are burning
throughout the nation
cracks in the earth have
swallowed dozens of homes
and panicked residents
are clogging the roads
attempting to escape
but there is no escape
the devastation is everywhere
the end of the world may
just be upon us
be praised the sword that
brings salvation to the world
though cruel misfortune
plagued thy steps
we offer thee now thy reward
choose now if thy will to
shed the scars of the past
the painful memory
of loved ones gone
or else choose to
embrace the past and
all you have become
the first road is peace
the other eternal war
in defense of the
meek and needy
choose and so it shall be
electrical power has
been partially restored
fire martial reports all
fires now under control
