rachel let me see
can i see
finders keepers and i found it
in my garden
finders keepers
bruce
bruce
mom mr alfred
did you have dream
nightmare
worse than this place
they are going to fight you
again
until they kill you
can they kill me before breakfast
you are in hell little man
and i am the devil
youre not the devil
youre practice
solitary
why
for protection
i dont need protection
protection for them
get in
are you so
desperate to fight criminals
that you lock yourself in
to take them on one at a time
actually there were seven of them
i counted six mr wayne
how do you know my name
the world is too small for someone
like bruce wayne to disappear
no matter how deep
he chooses to sink
who are you
my name is merely ducard
but i speak for ra al ghul
a man greatly feared
by the criminal underworld
a man who can offer you a path
what makes you think i need a path
someone like you
is only here by choice
you have been exploring
the criminal fraternity
but whatever
your original intentions
you have become truly lost
and what path can ra al ghul offer
the path of a man
who shares his hatred of evil
and wishes to serve true justice
the path of the league of shadows
youre vigilantes
no no no
a vigilante is just a man lost in
the scramble for his own gratification
he can be destroyed or locked up
but if you make yourself more
than just a man
if you devote yourself to an ideal
and if they cant stop you
then you become
something else entirely
which is
legend mr wayne
tomorrow you will be released
if you are bored of brawling with thieves
and want to achieve something
there is a rare blue flower
that grows on the eastern slopes
pick one of these flowers
if you can carry it
to the top of the mountain
you may find what you were
looking for in the first place
and what was i looking for
only you can know that
you turn back you go back
ra al ghul
wait
what are you seeking
iseeku
the means to fight injustice
to turn fear
against those
who prey on the fearful
to manipulate the fears in others
you must first master your own
are you ready to begin
i can i can barely stand
death does not wait
for you to be ready
death is not considerate or fair
and make no mistake
here you face death
tiger
jujitsu
panther
youre skilled but this is not a dance
and you are afraid
but not of me
tell us mr wayne
what do you fear
bruce
it okay it okay
youll be okay
will we be needing
an ambulance master wayne
no ill set the bone
and take him for an x-ray later
very good sir
im very sorry sir ive told
dont worry it fine
took quite a fall
didnt we master bruce
and why do we fall
so we can learn to pick ourselves up
just a little fall
it just a small fracture
the bats again
you know why they attacked you
dont you
they were afraid of you
afraid of me
all creatures feel fear
even the scary ones
especially the scary ones
i got something to show you
you think your mother will like them
yeah
i think it time to get up
maybe
no going back to bed
did you build this train dad
gotham been good to our family
but the city been suffering
people less fortunate than us
have been enduring very hard times
so we built a new cheap public
transportation system to unite the city
and at the center
wayne tower
is that where you work
no i work at the hospital
i leave the running of our company
to much better men
better
well
more interested men
can we go
please
okay let go
what wrong bruce
no no it was me
i just needed some fresh air
a little bit of opera goes a long way
right bruce
come on let go
wallets jewelry come on fast
that fine
fast
take it easy
take it easy
here you go
it fine it fine
now just take it and go
i said jewelry
hey
thomas
bruce
it okay
dont be afraid
is this your father
it okay
come here
there you go
it okay
it okay
gordon
hey
good news
we got him son
youre in excellent hands
well be watching the empire
when you grow up
itll be waiting for you
i thought i might prepare a little supper
very well
alfred
yes master bruce
it was my fault alfred
i made them leave the theater
no
if i hadnt gotten scared
it was nothing that you did
it was him and him alone
do you understand
i miss them alfred
i miss them so much
so do i master bruce
so do i
and do you still feel
responsible for your parents death
my anger outweighs my guilt
come
you have learned to bury
your guilt with anger
i will teach you to confront it
and to face the truth
you know how to fight six men
we can teach you how to engage 600
you know how to disappear
we can teach you
to become truly invisible
invisible
the ninja understands that invisibility
is a matter of patience and agility
always mind your surroundings
ninjitsu employs explosive powders
as weapons
or distractions
theatricality and deception
are powerful agents
you must become more than just a man
in the mind of your opponent
who is he
he was a farmer
then he tried to take his neighbor land
and became a murderer
now he is a prisoner
whatll happen to him
justice crime cannot be tolerated
criminals thrive on the indulgence
of society understanding
your parents death was not your fault
it was your father
anger does not change the fact
that your father failed to act
the man had a gun
would that stop you
ive had training
the training is nothing
will is everything
the will to act
yield
you havent beaten me
you have sacrificed sure footing
for a killing stroke
rub your chest
your arms will take care of themselves
you are stronger than your father
you didnt know my father
but i know the rage that drives you
that impossible anger
strangling the grief
until the memory
of your loved one is just
poison in your veins
and one day you catch yourself wishing
the person you loved had never existed
so youd be spared your pain
i wasnt always here in the mountains
once i had a wife
my great love
she was taken from me
like you i was forced to learn
there are those without decency
who must be fought
without hesitation without pity
your anger gives you great power
but if you let it it will destroy you
as it almost did me
what stopped it
vengeance
that no help to me
why bruce
why could you not
avenge your parents
will you be heading back to princeton
after the hearing sir
or can i persuade you to stay on
for a day or two
im not heading back at all
you dont like it there
i like it fine
they just dont feel the same way
ive prepared the master bedroom
no
my room will be fine
with all due respect sir
wayne manor is your house
no alfred it my father house
your father is dead
this place is a mausoleum
if i have my way ill pull
the damn thing down brick by brick
this house master wayne has sheltered
six generations of your family
why do you give a damn alfred
it not your family
i give a damn because a good man
once made me responsible
for what was most precious to him
in the whole world
miss dawes has offered
to drive you to the hearing
she probably hopes
to talk you out of going
should i just bury the past
out there with my parents alfred
i wouldnt presume to tell you
what to do with your past sir
just know that there are those of us who
care about what you do with your future
havent given up on me yet
never
alfred still keeps the condensed milk
on the top shelf
hasnt he noticed
youre tall enough to reach now
old habits die hard i guess
never used to stop us anyway
no it didnt
how your mom
she misses this place
so do i
yeah
but it nothing without the people
who made it what it was
now there only alfred
and you
im not staying rachel
youre just back for the hearing
bruce i dont suppose there any way
to convince you not to come
someone at this proceeding
should stand for my parents
we all loved your parents bruce
what chill did is unforgivable
then why is your boss letting him go
in prison he shared a cell
with carmine falcone
he learned things and he will testify
in exchange for early parole
rachel this man killed my parents
i cannot let that pass
and i need you
to understand that please
okay
the depression hit working
people like mr chill hardest of all
his crime was appalling yes
but it was motivated not by greed
but by desperation
given the 4 years served as well as
his extraordinary level of cooperation
with one of this office
most important investigations
we strongly endorse his petition
for early release
mr chill
your honor
not a day goes by that i dont wish
i could take back what i did
sure i was desperate
like a lot of people back then
but that dont change what i did
i gather there is a member
of the wayne family here today
has he got anything to say
he coming out the side
he coming out the side guys
bruce wayne
joe hey joe
falcone says hi
come on bruce
we dont need to see this
i do
the da couldnt understand
why judge faden insisted
on making the hearing public
falcone paid him off
to get chill out in the open
maybe i should thank them
you dont mean that
what if i do rachel
my parents deserved justice
youre not talking about justice
youre talking about revenge
sometimes theyre the same
no theyre never the same
justice is about harmony revenge is
about you making yourself feel better
it why we have an impartial system
your system is broken
you care about justice
look beyond your own pain bruce
this city is rotting
they talk about the depression
as if it history it not
things are worse than ever here
falcone floods our streets
with crime and drugs
preying on the desperate
creating new joe chills every day
falcone may not have killed
your parents bruce
but he destroying everything
that they stood for
you wanna thank him for that
here you go
we all know where to find him
as long as he keeps the bad people rich
and the good people scared
no onell touch him
good people like your parents wholl
stand against injustice theyre gone
what chance does gotham have
when the good people do nothing
im not one of your good people rachel
what do you mean
all these years i wanted to kill him
now i cant
your father would be ashamed of you
youre taller than you look
in the tabloids mr wayne
no gun im insulted
you couldve just sent a thank-you note
i didnt come here to thank you
i came to show you that
not everyone in gotham afraid of you
only those who know me kid
look around you
youll see two councilmen
a union official
couple off-duty cops
and a judge
i wouldnt have a second hesitation of
blowing your head off in front of them
now that power you cant buy
that the power of fear
im not afraid of you
because you think you got
nothing to lose
but you havent thought it through
you havent thought about
your lady friend in the da office
you havent thought about
your old butler bang
people from your world
have so much to lose
now you think because your mommy
and your daddy got shot
you know about the ugly side of life
but you dont
youve never tasted desperate
youre youre bruce wayne
the prince of gotham
youd have to go 000 miles to meet
someone who didnt know your name
so dont come here with your anger
trying to prove something to yourself
this is a world youll never understand
and you always fear
what you dont understand
all right
yeah you got spirit kid
ill give you that
more than your old man anyway
in the joint chill told me about
the night he killed your parents
he said your father begged for mercy
begged
like a dog
shouldve tipped better
for what
your jacket
okay
hey hey hey let me have it
it a nice coat
be careful who sees you with that
theyre gonna come looking for me
who
everyone
it
it a nice coat
when you lived among
the criminals did you start to pity them
the first time i stole
so that i wouldnt starve yes
i lost many assumptions about
the simple nature of right and wrong
and when i traveled
l learned the fear before a crime
and the thrill of success
but i never became one of them
fool what do i care
what your name is youre a criminal
im not a criminal
tell that to the guy who owned these
youve traveled the world
to understand the criminal mind
and conquer your fears
but a criminal is not complicated
and what you really fear
is inside yourself
you fear your own power
you fear your anger
the drive to do great
or terrible things
now you must journey inwards
you are ready
breathe
breathe
breathe in your fears
face them
to conquer fear
you must become fear
you must bask in the fear
of other men
and men fear most
what they cannot see
you have to become a terrible thought
a wraith
you have to become an idea
feel terror cloud your senses
feel its power to distort
to control
and know that this power
can be yours
embrace your worst fear
become one with the darkness
focus
concentrate
master your senses
you cannot leave any sign
i havent
impressive
we have purged your fear
you are ready to lead these men
you are ready to become a member
of the league of shadows
but first you must demonstrate
your commitment to justice
no
im no executioner
your compassion is
a weakness your enemies will not share
that why it so important
it separates us from them
you want to fight criminals
this man is a murderer
this man should be tried
by whom
corrupt bureaucrats
criminals mock society laws
you know this better than most
you cannot lead these men
unless you are prepared to do
what is necessary to defeat evil
and where would i be leading
these men
gotham
as gotham favored son
you will be ideally placed
to strike at the heart of criminality
how
gotham time has come
like constantinople or rome before it
the city has become a breeding ground
for suffering and injustice
it is beyond saving
and must be allowed to die
this is the most important function
of the league of shadows
it is one weve performed for centuries
gotham
must be destroyed
you cant believe in this
ra al ghul rescued us from
the darkest corners of our own hearts
what he asks in return is the courage
to do what is necessary
i will go back to gotham
and i will fight men like this
but i will not become an executioner
bruce please
for your own sake
there is no turning back
what are you doing
what necessary my friend
i will tell him you saved his life
master wayne
youve been gone a long time
yes i have
you look very fashionable
apart from the mud
are you coming back to gotham
for long sir
as long as it takes
i want to show the people
their city doesnt belong
to the criminals and the corrupt
in the depression your father nearly
bankrupted wayne enterprises
combating poverty
he believed his example could inspire
the wealthy of gotham to save their city
did it
in a way
their murder shocked the wealthy
and the powerful into action
people need dramatic examples
to shake them out of apathy
i cant do that as bruce wayne
asa man
im flesh and blood
i can be ignored destroyed
but as a symbol
as a symbol i can be incorruptible
i can be everlasting
what symbol
something elemental
something terrifying
i assume that as you take on
the underworld
this symbol is a persona to protect
those you care about from reprisals
youre thinking about rachel
actually sir i was thinking of myself
have you told anyone im coming back
i couldnt figure the legal ramifications
of bringing you back from the dead
dead
youve been gone seven years
you had me declared dead
actually it was mr earle
he taking the company public
he wanted to liquidate
your majority shareholding
those shares are worth
quite a bit of money
well it a good thing
i left everything to you then
quite so sir
and you can borrow the rolls if you like
just bring it back with a full tank
in my opinion mr zsaz is as much
a danger to himself as to others
and prison is probably not the best
environment for his rehabilitation
dr crane
miss dawes
you think a man who butchers people
for the mob doesnt belong in jail
i would hardly have testified to that
otherwise would i
this is the third of falcone thugs
youve had declared insane
and moved into your asylum
the work offered by organized crime
must have an attraction to the insane
or the corrupt
mr finch
you should check
with miss dawes here
just what implications your office
has authorized her to make if any
what are you doing
what are you doing carl
looking out for you
falcone has half the city
bought and paid for
drop it
how can you say that
because as much as i care about
getting falcone i care more about you
that sweet
weve been through all that
blessed bat again sir
they nest somewhere in the grounds
no more favors
someone is sniffing around
hey i scratch your back
you scratch mine doc
im bringing in the shipments
we are paying you for that
maybe money isnt as interesting
to me as favors
i am more than aware that you are
not intimidated by me mr falcone
but you know who im working for
and when he gets here
he he coming to gotham
yes he is
and when he gets here
he not going to wanna hear
that youve endangered our operation
just to get your thugs out of jail time
who bothering you
there a girl at the da office
well buy her off
not this one
idealist huh
well there an answer to that too
i dont want to know
yes you do
no we are showing
very healthy growth in these sectors
i dont think thomas wayne would have
viewed heavy-arms manufacture
as a suitable cornerstone
for our business
well that 20 years ago fredericks
i think after 20 years
we can allow ourselves
to stop thinking about what
thomas wayne would have done
good morning mr earle office
yes he confirmed for
the dinner tomorrow evening
good morning
im here to see mr earle
name
bruce wayne
thomas would probably not
have taken the company public
but that is what we
as responsible managers are going to do
jessica
jessica where are you
eye on the ball and
why is no one answering the phone
it wayne enterprises mr earle
im sure theyll call back
bruce youre supposed to be dead
im sorry to disappoint
i need you to take a look at this
have you seen him yet
who
wayne
it been all over the news
he back
im sure you realize
i cant stop the big machine
too many wheels turning
were going public
i understand
and ill be handsomely rewarded
for my shares
im not looking to interfere
i am looking for a job
oh
i just want to get to know the company
that my family built
any ideas where you would start
applied sciences caught my eye
fox department
ill let him know youre coming
you look like him your dad
youre the only one left
of the wayne family
this is where you belong
welcome home
environmental procedures
defense projects consumer products
all prototypes none in production
on any level whatsoever
none
what did they tell you this place was
they didnt tell me anything
earle told me exactly what it was
when he sent me down here
dead end
place to keep me from causing
the board any more trouble
come on
you were on the board
when your father ran things
you knew my father
oh yeah
helped him build his train
here we are
kevlar utility harness
gas-powered magnetic grapple gun
the 350-pound test monofilament
wonderful project your dad train
routed it right into wayne tower
along with the water and power utilities
kind of made wayne tower
the unofficial center of gotham city
of course earle let it go to rot
here we are
nomex survival suit
for advanced infantry
kevlar biweave reinforced joints
tear-resistant
this sucker will stop a knife
bulletproof
anything but a straight shot
why didnt they put it into production
bean counters didnt think
a soldier life was worth 300 grand
so what your interest in it
mr wayne
i want to borrow it
for spelunking
spelunking
yeah you know cave diving
you expecting to run into
much gunfire in these caves
look id rather mr earle
didnt know about me borrowing
mr wayne
the way i see it
all this stuff is yours anyway
okay give it a try
charming
at least youll have company
this must be the lowest foundation
of the southeast wing
your great-great-grandfather was
involved in the underground railroad
secretly transporting freed slaves
to the north
and i suspect these caverns
came in handy
alfred come up here
i can see everything all right
from down here sir thank you
we order the main part
of this cowl from singapore
via a dummy corporation
indeed and then quite separately
we place an order
to a chinese company for these
put it together ourselves
precisely
theyll have to be large orders
to avoid suspicion
how large
say 0000
well at least well have spares
yes
dont suppose you want a taste
i just keep offering
thinking maybe someday youll get wise
there nothing wise
in what you do flass
well jimbo you dont take the taste
makes us guys nervous
im no rat
in a town this bent
who thereto rat to anyway
dont turn around
youre a good cop
one of the few
what do you want
carmine falcone brings
in shipments of drugs every week
nobody takes him down why
he paid up with the right people
what will it take to bring him down
leverage on judge faden
and a da brave enough
to prosecute
rachel dawes
who are you
watch for my sign
youre just one man
now were two
we
freeze
what the hell was that
just some nut
well what is it today
more spelunking
no today it base-jumping
base-jumping
that like parachuting
kind of
do you have any lightweight fabrics
you know i think i have just the thing
it called memory cloth
notice anything
regularly flexible
but put a current through it
molecules realign it becomes rigid
what kind of shapes can you make
can be tailored to fit any structure
based on a rigid skeleton
too expensive for the army
i dont think they tried to market it
to the billionaire base-jumping crowd
look mr fox
yes sir
if youre uncomfortable
mr wayne if you dont want to tell me
exactly what youre doing
when im asked i dont have to lie
but dont think of me as an idiot
fair enough
what that
the tumbler
oh you wouldnt be interested in that
she was built as a bridging vehicle
during combat two of these
would jump over a river towing cables
over here on the throttle
flip that open and throttle up
this will boost you into a rampless jump
not now
not not now sir
afterburner disengaged
we never could get
the damn bridge to work
but this baby works just fine
so what do you think
does it come in black
i need you at the docks thursday
problems
i dont want any trouble
with the last shipment
sure
word on the street is you got a beef
with somebody in the da office
is that right
and that there a fat prize
waiting for anybody willing
to do anything about it
so what your point mr flass
have you seen the girl
it a cute little assistant da
dont you think that a little too much
heat to bring down maybe
even for this town
never underestimate gotham city
people get mugged coming home
from work every day of the week
sometimes
sometimes things just go bad
it a problem with the graphite sir
the next 0000
will be up to specifications
at least they gave us a discount
quite
in the meantime sir may i suggest
you try to avoid landing on your head
why bats master wayne
bats frighten me
it time my enemies shared my dread
what is this
continue
looks fine out there
the bears go straight to the dealers
yeah and the rabbits go
to the man in the narrows
what the difference
ignorance is bliss my friend
dont burden yourself
with the secrets of scary people
hey steiss
stems
what
what the
i better check it
there a problem out here
you better bail
where are you
here
take a ride oh shit
what the hell are you
im batman
nice coat
thanks
hold it
that right you better run
falcone sent them to kill you
why
you rattled his cage
what this
leverage
for what
to get things moving
who are you
someone like you
someone wholl rattle the cages
maam everything okay
falcone men
does it matter
well never tie him to it anyway
i wouldnt be too sure of that
what the hell is that
cut him down
unacceptable
now i dont care if it rival gangs
guardian angels
or the goddamn salvation army
get them off the street
and off the front page
they say it was just one guy
or a creature
it was some asshole in a costume
yeah
this guy did deliver us
one of the city biggest crime lords
no one takes the law
into their own hands in my city
understand
no way to bury it now
there still judge faden
ive got faden covered
what about this bat they babble about
even if these guys will swear
to being thrashed by a giant bat
weve got falcone at the scene
drugs prints cargo manifests
this bat character gave us everything
okay let do it
bats are nocturnal
bats may be
but even for billionaire playboys
300 is pushing it
the price for leading a double life
i fear
your theatrics made an impression
theatricality and deception
are powerful weapons alfred
this is a good start
if those are to be the first
of many injuries to come
it would be wise
to find a suitable excuse
polo for instance
im not learning polo alfred
strange injuries
a nonexistent social life
these things beg the question
as to what exactly does bruce wayne
do with his time and his money
what does someone like me do
drive sports cars date movie stars
buy things that are not for sale
who knows master wayne
you start pretending to have fun
you might even have a little
by accident
sir
we have a situation
all right
the coast guard picked up
one of our cargo ships last night
heavily damaged all crew missing
probably dead
the ship was carrying
a prototype weapon
it a microwave emitter
it designed for desert warfare but it
it looks like somebody
turned it on
it uses focused microwaves to
vaporize the enemy water supply
the damage to the ship
was catastrophic
the weapon itself is
missing
yeah
mr wayne
nice car
you should see my other one
he done something
the police never have
you cant take the law
into your own hands
well at least he getting
something done
bruce help me out here
huh
well a guy who dresses up
like a bat clearly has issues
but he put falcone behind bars
now the cops want him
what does that tell you
theyre jealous
sir the pool is for decoration
and your friends
do not have swimwear
well theyre european
im going to have to ask you to leave
it is not a question of money
well you see
im buying this hotel
and setting some new rules
about the pool area
i think the batman deserves a medal
and a straitjacket to pin it on
thank you
bruce
rachel
id heard you were back
what are you doing
just swimming here
wow it is good to see you
you were gone a long time
i know how are things
the same
job getting worse
cant change the world on your own
what choice do i have
when youre too busy swimming
rachel all of
all this
it it not me it
inside i am
i am more
come on bruce come on
bruce we have
some more hotels for you to buy
bruce
deep down you may still be
that same great kid you used to be
but it not who you are underneath
it what you do that defines you
dr crane thanks for coming
not at all he cut his wrists
probably looking for the insanity plea
but if anything should happen
of course better safe than sorry
yeah dr crane i cant take it anymore
it all too much
the walls are closing in
blah blah blah
a couple of days of this food
itll be true
what do you want
i wanna know
how youre gonna convince me
to keep my mouth shut
about what
you dont know anything
i know you dont want the cops to take
a closer look at the drugs they seized
and i know about your experiments
with the inmates of your nut house
see i dont go into business with a guy
without finding out his dirty secrets
and those goons you used
i own the muscle in this town
now ive been bringing
your stuff in for months
so whatever he planning
it big and i want in
well i already know what hell say
that we should kill you
even he cant get me in here
not in my town
would you like to see my mask
i use it in my experiments
now im probably not very frightening
to a guy like you
but these crazies they cant stand it
so when did the nut
take over the nut house
they scream and they cry
much as youre doing now
well he not faking not that one
ill talk to the judge
and see if i can get him moved
to the secure wing at arkham
i cant treat him here
storm coming
the scum is getting jumpy
because you stood up to falcone
it a start your partner
was at the docks with falcone
well he moonlights
as a low-level enforcer
they were splitting the shipment in two
only half went to the dealers
why what about the other half
flass knows
he wont talk
hell talk to me
commissioner loeb set up
a massive task force to catch you
he thinks youre dangerous
what do you think
i think youre trying to help
but ive been wrong before
come on i aint got all night
flass i have kids to feed
what they dont like falafel
where were the other drugs going
i never knew i dont know
i swear to god
swear to me
i dont i dont know
i never knew never
they went to some guy for a couple days
before they went to the dealers
why
there was something
something else in the drugs
something hidden
what
i never went to the drop-off point
it was in the narrows
cops only go there in force
do i look like a cop
no
this is the one im talking about
what your problem with it
it shouldnt exist
this ship left singapore with
246 containers but arrived with 247
im guessing there something
im not supposed to find in there
listen counselor we dont wanna
know what in mr falcone crate
things are working a little
differently now open it up
what the hell is this
it you isnt it
everybody been talking about you
get in here
the other kids wont believe me
get rid of all traces
better torch the whole place
all right
having trouble
take a seat have a drink
you look like a man
who takes himself too seriously
do you want my opinion
you need to lighten up
alfred help me
blood take take poison blood poison
poisonous poisonous
bruce
why do we fall
how long was i out
two days
it your birthday
many happy returns
ive felt these effects before
but this was so much more potent
it was some kind of hallucinogen
weaponized in aerosol form
you have been hanging out
in the wrong clubs mr wayne
i called mr fox when your condition
worsened after the first day
i analyzed your blood
isolating the receptor compounds
and the protein-based catalyst
am i meant to understand any of that
not at all i just wanted you to know
how hard it was
bottom line i synthesized an antidote
could you make more
you planning on gassing yourself
again mr wayne
well you know how it is
youre out at night looking for kicks
someone passing around
the weaponized hallucinogens
ill bring what i have
the antidote should inoculate you for now
alfred always a pleasure
lucius
you sure you dont want to come in
i have to get back
i wanted to leave this
thank you
rachel
looks like someone been
burning the candle at both ends
mustve been quite an occasion
it is my birthday
i know im sorry i cant come tonight
i was just dropping off your present
youve got better plans
my boss has been missing for days
which means i should
probably start by looking
at the bottom of the river
rachel
excuse me
rachel dawes
who authorized that get crane down
there now dont take no for an answer
call dr lehmann tell him we need our
own assessment to the judge by morning
what wrong
it falcone
dr crane moved him to arkham asylum
on suicide watch
youre going to arkham now
it in the narrows rachel
you enjoy your party bruce
some of us have work to do
you be careful
happy birthday
but master wayne
the guests will be arriving
keep them happy until i arrive
tell them that joke you know
having fun
bill now what a big shot like you
doing in a place like this
i need some information
the wayne enterprise 47-b -me
-me
it a microwave emitter it was designed
to vaporize an enemy water supply
rumor was they tested dispersing
water-based chemicals into the air
but isnt that illegal
i want all the information
on the development of this project
all data files backup disks
on my desk right away
did you lose one
im merging your department
with archives
and i am firing you
didnt you get the memo
scarecrow
scarecrow
scarecrow
miss dawes this is most irregular
i have nothing to add
to the report i filed with the judge
i have questions about your report
such as
isnt it convenient for a 52-year-old man
who has no history of mental illness
to have a psychotic breakdown
just when he about to be indicted
as you can see for yourself there is
nothing convenient about his symptoms
scarecrow
what scarecrow
patients suffering delusional episodes
often focus their paranoia
on an external tormentor
usually one conforming
to jungian archetypes
in this case a scarecrow
he drugged
psychopharmacology is my primary field
im a strong advocate
outside he was a giant
in here only the mind
can grant you power
you enjoy the reversal
i respect the mind power
over the body
it why i do what i do
i do what i do to keep thugs like falcone
behind bars not in therapy
i want my own psychiatric consultant
to have full access to falcone
including blood work
find out what exactly you put him on
first thing tomorrow then
tonight
ive already paged dr lehmann
at county general
as you wish
this way please
there something
i think you should see
this is where we make the medicine
perhaps you should have some
clear your head
who knows youre here
who knows
he here
who
the batman
what do we do
what anyone does
when a prowler comes around
call the police
you want the cops here
at this point they cant stop us
but the batman
has a talent for disruption
force him outside
the police will take him down go
what about her
she hasnt got long
i gave her a concentrated dose
the mind can only take so much
now go
the things they say about him
can he really fly
i heard he can disappear
well well find out
wont we
taste of your own medicine doctor
what have you been doing here
who are you working for
ra ra al ghul
ra al ghul is dead
who are you working for
crane
dr crane isnt here right now
but if youd like to make
an appointment
batman put down your
weapons and surrender
youre surrounded

hallucinogen a panic-inducing toxin
let me get her down to the medics
they cant help her but i can
get her downstairs
meet me in the alley
crane been smuggling his toxin
hidden in falcone drugs
and theyre dumping it
into the water supply
what was he planning
i dont know
was he working for falcone
he mentioned someone else
someone worse
she needs the antidote
before the damage is permanent
how long does she have
not long
what is that
backup
what the
excuse me
how is she
she fading we gotta go
ill get my car

yeah
notify the water company
there gotta be a way to isolate it
no they put it all in
they mustve been at this for weeks
gotham entire water supply is laced
why havent we felt the effects
must be a compound that
has to be absorbed through the lungs
how do you feel
where are we
why did you bring me here
if i hadnt your mind would be lost
you were poisoned
it was
it was dr crane
rest gordon has crane

i dont have the luxury of friends
im gonna give you a sedative
youll wake up back at home
when you do get these to gordon
and gordon alone trust no one
what are they
the antidote
one for gordon to inoculate himself
the other for mass production
mass production
crane was just a pawn
we need to be ready
when you told me your grand plan
for saving gotham
all that stopped me
from calling the men in white coats
was when you said
it wasnt about thrill-seeking
it not
what would you call that
damn good television
it a miracle no one was killed
i didnt have time to observe
the rules of the road alfred
youre getting lost inside
this monster of yours
im using this monster to help
other people just like my father did
for thomas wayne helping others
wasnt about proving anything
to anyone including himself
it rachel alfred she was dying
she downstairs sedated
i need you to take her home
well we both care for rachel but what
youre doing has to be beyond that
it cant be personal
or youre just a vigilante
is fox still here
yes sir
we need to send these people away
those are bruce wayne guests
you have a name to maintain
i dont care about my name
it not just your name sir
it your father name
and it all that left of him
dont destroy it
mr earle
happy birthday bruce
thank you
how did the stock offering go
prices soared
who was buying
all kinds of funds and brokerages
it a bit technical
the key thing is
our company future is secure
great
a little the worse for wear im afraid
what was the plan crane
how were you gonna get
your toxin into the air
scarecrow scarecrow
who were you working for crane
oh it too late
you cant stop it now
here
happy birthday bruce
thank you thanks
and thank you for that item
youre welcome
i know youll put it to good use
i already have
how long would it take
to manufacture on a large scale
weeks why
somebody planning to disperse
the toxin using the water supply
the water supply wont help you
disperse an inhalant
what
unless you have a microwave emitter
powerful enough
to vaporize all the water
in the mains
a microwave emitter like the one
wayne enterprises just misplaced
misplaced
earle just fired me for asking
too many questions about it
go back to wayne enterprises now
and start making more of that antidote
the police are gonna need as much
as they can get their hands on
my security clearance
has been revoked
that wouldnt stop a man like you
would it
i suppose not
bruce there somebody you must meet
not now mrs delane
now am i pronouncing this right
mr ra al ghul
youre not ra al ghul
i watched him die
but is ra al ghul immortal
are his methods supernatural
or cheap parlor tricks to conceal
your true identity ra
surely a man who spends his nights
scrambling over the rooftops of gotham
wouldnt begrudge me dual identities
i saved your life
i warned you about compassion bruce
your quarrel is with me
you let these people go
you are welcome to explain
the situation to them
everyone
everybody
i
i want to thank you all for coming here
tonight and drinking all of my booze
no really
there a thing about being a wayne
that youre never short of
a few freeloaders like yourselves
to fill up your mansion with
so here to you people thank you
that enough bruce
im not finished
to all of you
all of you phonies
all of you two-faced friends
you sycophantic suck-ups
who smile through your teeth at me
please leave me in peace
please go
stop smiling it not a joke
please leave
the party over get out
the apple has fallen very far
from the tree mr wayne
he turning into a jerk
amusing
but pointless
none of these people have long to live
your antics at the asylum
have forced my hand
so crane was working for you
his toxin is derived from the organic
compound found in our blue flowers
he was able to weaponize it
he not a member of
the league of shadows
of course not he thought our plan
was to hold the city to ransom
but really you are gonna release
crane poison on the entire city
then watch gotham tear itself apart
through fear
youre gonna destroy millions of lives
only a cynical man would call
what these people have lives wayne
crime despair
this is not how man
was supposed to live
the league of shadows has been
a check against human corruption
for thousands of years
we sacked rome
loaded trade ships with plague rats
burned london to the ground
every time a civilization reaches
the pinnacle of its decadence
we return to restore the balance
gotham isnt beyond saving
give me more time
there are good people here
youre defending a city so corrupt
we have infiltrated
every level of its infrastructure
time to play
when i found you in that jail
you were lost
but i believed in you
i took away your fear
and i showed you a path
you were my greatest student
it should be you standing by my side
saving the world
ill be standing where i belong
between you
and the people of gotham
no one can save gotham
when a forest grows too wild
a purging fire is inevitable and natural
tomorrow the world will watch in horror
as its greatest city destroys itself
the movement back to harmony
will be unstoppable this time
you attacked gotham before
of course
over the ages our weapons
have grown more sophisticated
with gotham we tried a new one
economics
but we underestimated certain
of gotham citizens
such as your parents
gunned down by one of the very people
they were trying to help
create enough hunger
and everyone becomes a criminal
their deaths galvanized the city
into saving itself
and gotham has limped on
ever since
we are back to finish the job
and this time no misguided idealists
will get in the way
like your father you lack the courage
to do all that is necessary
if someone stands in the way
of true justice
you simply walk up behind them
and stab them in the heart
i am gonna stop you
you never did learn
to mind your surroundings
justice is balance
you burned my house
and left me for dead
consider us even
no one comes out make sure
theyre all gone
how many from maximum security
every one of them
serial killers rapists
raise the bridges
we dont want any getting off the island
yeah ill raise the bridges
when i get every available unit out here
to catch the homicidal maniacs
that are running loose out there
come on
i hope youre not a member
of the fire brigade
master wayne master wayne
what is the point of all those pushups
if you cant even lift a bloody log
what have i done alfred
everything my family
my father built
the wayne legacy is more
than bricks and mortar sir
i wanted to save gotham
i failed
why do we fall sir
so that we can learn
to pick ourselves up
you still havent given up on me
never
down
harassment i see harassment
maybe youd like to see
some excessive force
madman with a gun
with residents furious
at the unprecedented show of police
strength to round up the inmates
were about to raise these bridges
officer i am a gotham city
district attorney let me pass
just shut up
hey flass cool it
hold these people back
hey gordon
somebody here to see you
what are you doing here
our friend sent me with this
it counteracts crane toxin
hopefully you wont need it
not unless he got some way
of getting that crap into the air
all right last one across
people they want this
bridge up in no more than three minutes
better get you off the island before
they raise the bridges patrolman
go
i cant find my mom
hey
what the hell are you doing
gentlemen
time to spread the word
and the word is
panic
jesus the pressure it spiking
right there
that water main
is right under the narrows
it okay
this is commissioner loeb
come on somebody talk to me
come on
loeb loeb this is gordon
what the hell is going on
we need reinforcements
tac teams swat riot cops
gordon all the city riot police
are on the island with you
well theyre completely incapacitated
it okay it okay
no one gonna hurt you
of course they are
crane
no scarecrow
gordon
there nobody left to send in
so im on my own
the narrows is tearing itself to pieces
this is just the beginning
if they hit the whole city
there nothing to stop gotham
tearing itself apart
how are they gonna do that
the train
the monorail follows the water mains to
the central hub beneath wayne tower
if the machine gets to the station
itll cause a chain reaction
thatll vaporize the city water supply
covering gotham in this poison
im gonna stop him from loading
that train but i may need your help
what do you need
can you drive stick
there you are
there is nothing to fear
but fear itself
i am here to help you
batman will save us hell come
hell come
dont peek
this is gordon
prepare to lower the bridge
i told you hed come
wait
you could die
at least tell me your name
it not who i am underneath
but what i do that defines me
bruce
well well you took my advice
about theatricality a bit literally
it ends here
for you and the police maybe
my fight however
lies with the rest of gotham
now if youll excuse me
i have a city to destroy
i cant beat two of your pawns
as you wish
gps online
in 00 yards
gentlemen
who the hell authorized this
distance to wayne tower three miles
the pressure moving along the mains
blowing the pipes
if that pressure reaches us
the water supply right across
the whole city is gonna blow
at the next intersection turn right
you will never learn
sorry
familiar dont you have anything new
how about this
you have arrived at wayne tower
evacuate the building
were on top of the main hub
and it gonna blow
weapons system activated
nice ride
armed
dont be afraid bruce
come on come on
you are just an ordinary man in a cape
that why you couldnt fight injustice
that why you cant stop this train
who said anything about stopping it
yes
you never learned
to mind your surroundings
have you finally learned to do
what is necessary
i wont kill you
but i dont have to save you
the meeting already started
what meeting
fox i seem to remember firing you
you did
i got another job
yours
on whose authority
batman may
have made the front page
but bruce wayne
got pushed to page eight
bruce wayne
what makes you think you can decide
who running wayne enterprises
the fact that im the owner
what are you talking about
the company went public a week ago
and i bought most of the shares
through various charitable foundations
and trusts and so forth
look it all a bit technical
but the important thing
is that my company future
is secure
right mr fox
right you are mr wayne
didnt you get the memo
im sorry i didnt tell you rachel
no no bruce
im sorry
the day that chill died l
i said terrible things
but true things
i was a coward with a gun
and justice is about more
than revenge so thank you
i never stopped thinking about you
about us
and when i heard you were back l
i started to hope
but then i found out about your mask
batman just a symbol rachel
no this
is your mask
your real face is the one
that criminals now fear
the man i loved
the man who vanished
he never came back at all
but maybe he still
out there somewhere
maybe someday
when gotham no longer needs batman
ill see him again
proved me wrong you know
about what
your father would be very proud of you
just like me
what will you do
rebuild it
just the way it was brick for brick
just the way it was sir
yeah why
i thought this might be
a good opportunity for
improving the foundations
in the southeast corner
precisely sir
nice
i couldnt find any mob bosses
well sergeant
it lieutenant now
you really started something
bent cops running scared
hope on the streets
but
the narrows is lost
and we still havent picked up crane or
half the inmates of arkham that he freed
we will
we can bring gotham back
what about escalation
escalation
we start carrying semiautomatics
they buy automatics
we start wearing kevlar
they buy armor-piercing rounds
and
and youre wearing a mask
and jumping off rooftops
now take this guy
armed robbery double homicide
got a taste for the theatrical like you
leaves a calling card
ill look into it
i never said thank you
and youll never have to
