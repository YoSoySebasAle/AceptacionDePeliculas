laura
you dont need to do that
because youre just
holding the position
only that
that was close
that a goal
we are now one apiece
i would like to try again
were tied up
feel the tension
it fun
that was terrible
now you have a chance to win
and youve won
congratulations

this thing on
hey miss potts pep
if you find this recording
dont post it
on social media
it gonna be a real tearjerker
i dont know if youre ever
gonna see these
i dont even know if youre still
oh god i hope so
today day 2
no 22
you know if it wasnt
for the existential terror
of staring into the literal void of space
id say im feeling a little better today
infection run its course
thanks to the blue meanie back there
youd love her
very practical
only a tiny bit sadistic
so the fuel cells were cracked
during battle and we figured out
a way to reverse the ion charge
and bought ourselves about
48 hours of flight time
but it now dead in the water
thousand light years
from the nearest 7-eleven
oxygen will run out
tomorrow morning
and thatll be it
and pep i
i know i said no more surprises but
i got to say i was really hoping
to pull off one last one
but it looks like
well you know what it looks like
dont feel bad about this
i mean actually if you
grovel for a couple weeks
and then move on
with enormous guilt
i should probably lie down
for a minute
go rest my eyes
please know
when i drift off
itll be like every night lately
im fine totally fine
i dream about you
because it always you
couldnt stop him
neither could i
hang on
i lost the kid
tony we lost
is
good
oh my god
oh my god
it ok
it been 23 days
since thanos came to earth
world governments are in pieces
the parts that are still working
are trying to take a census
and it looks like he did
he did exactly what he said
he was gonna do
thanos wiped out
50% of all living creatures
where is he now where
we dont know
he just opened a portal
and walked through
what wrong with him
he pissed
he thinks he failed
which of course he did
but there is a lot of that
going around aint there
honestly until this exact second
i thought you were a build-a-bear
maybe i am
weve been hunting thanos
for three weeks now
deep space scans
and satellites and we got nothing
tony you fought him
who told you that
i didnt fight him
no he wiped my face with a planet
while the bleecker street
magician gave away the store
that what happened
there was no fight
because he not beatable
ok
did he give you any clues
any coordinates anything
i saw this coming a few years back
i had a vision
i didnt wanna believe it
thought i was dreaming
tony im gonna need you to focus
and i needed you
as in past tense that trumps
what you need it too late buddy
sorry
you know what i need
i need to shave
and i believe i rememeber telling
tony tony tony
oh yes
why that otherwise
that what we needed
was a suit of armor around
the world remember that
whether it impacted
our precious freedoms
or not that what we needed
well that didnt work out did it
i said wed lose
you said well do that together too
well guess what cap
we lost
you werent there
but that what we do right
our best work after the fact
were the avengers
were the avengers
not the prevengers
ok you made your point
right
just sit down ok
ok
no no here my
tony sit
she great by the way
sit down
we need you
youre new blood
bunch of tired old mills
i got nothing for you cap
i got no coordinates
no clues no strategies no options
zero zip nada
no trust you liar
you take this
you find him and you put that on
you hide
tony
im fine
i
bruce gave him a sedative
he gonna probably be out
for the rest of the day
you guys take care of him
and ill bring an bezurian
elixir when i come back
where are you going
to kill thanos
hey
you know we usually work
as a team here and
between you and i
were also a little fragile
we realize up there is more your
territory but this is our fight too
you even know where he is
i know people who might
dont bother
i can tell you where thanos is
thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me
then when he worked
he talked about
his great plan
even disassembled
i wanted to please him
id ask
where would we go once
his plan was complete
his answer was always the same
to the garden
that cute
thanos has a retirement plan
so where is he
when thanos snapped his fingers
earth became ground zero for a power surge
of ridiculously cosmic proportions
no one ever seen anything like it
until two days ago
on this planet
thanos is there
he used the stones again
hey hey hey hey
wed be going in
short-handed you know
look he still got the stones so
so let get him
we use them to bring everyone back
just like that
yeah just like that
even if there is a small chance
that we can undo this
i mean we owe it to everyone
who not in this room to try
if we do this how do we know it gonna
end any differently than it did before
because before you didnt have me
hey new girl everybody in this
room is about that superhero life
and if you dont mind my asking where
the hell have you been all this time
there are a lot of other planets
in the universe
and unfortunately
they didnt have you guys
i like this one
let go get this son of a bitch
ok
who here hasnt been to space
you better not throw up on my ship
approaching jump in 3 2
ill head down for recon
this is gonna work steve
i know it will
because i dont know what
im gonna do if it doesnt
no satellites
no ships
no armies no ground defenses
of any kind
it just him
then that enough
oh no
where are they
answer the question
the universe required correction
after that
the stones served no purpose
beyond temptation
you murdered trillions
you should be grateful
where are the stones
gone
reduced to atoms
you used them two days ago
i used the stones
to destroy the stones
it nearly killed me
but the work is done
it always will be
i am inevitable
we have to tear this place apart
he has to be lying
my father is many things
a liar is not one of them
thank you daughter
perhaps i treated you too harshly
what
what did you do
i went for the head
so i
went on a date the other day
it the first time in five years
you know
sit there dinner
i didnt know what to talk about
what did you talk about
same old crap you know
how things have changed and
my job his job
how much we miss the mets
then things get quiet
he cried as they were
serving the salads
what about you
i cried just before dessert
but im seeing him again tomorrow so
that great
you did the hardest part
you took the jump you didnt know
where you were gonna come down
and that it
that those little
brave baby steps you got to take
to try and become whole again
to try and find purpose
i went in the ice in 45 right after
i met the love of my life
woke up 70 years later
you got to move on
got to move on
the world is in our hands
it left to us guys
and we got to do something with it
otherwise
thanos should have killed all of us
what the hell
hope
kid
hey kid
what the hell happened here
my god
no please
please please
no no no
no
no
excuse me sorry
no cassie no
no
no no
please please please please please
please no cassie
what
cassie
dad
youre so big
yeah we boarded that highly
suspect warship danvers pinged
it was an infectious garbage scowl
so thanks for the hot tip
well you were closer
yeah
and now we smell like garbage
you get a reading on those tremors
it was a mild subduction
under the african plate
do we have a visual
how are we handling it
nat it an earthquake
under the ocean
we handle it by not handling it
carol are we seeing
you here next month
not likely
what you gonna get another haircut
listen fur-face
im covering a lot of territory
the things that are happening on earth
are happening everywhere
on thousands of planets
that a good point
that a good point
so you might not see
me for a long time
alright
well
this channel is always active
so anything goes sideways
anyone making trouble
where they should not
comes through me
ok
ok
alright
good luck
where are you
mexico
the federales found a room
full of bodies
looks like a
bunch of cartel guys never even
had the chance to get their guns off
it probably a rival gang
except it isnt
it definitely barton
what he done here
what he been doing
for the last few years
i mean the scene that he left
i got to tell you there is a part of
me that doesnt even wanna find him
will you find out where he going next
nat
please
ok
you know id offer to clip your dinner but
you seem pretty miserable already
you here to do your laundry
and to see a friend
clearly your friend is fine
you know i saw a pod of whales
when i was coming up the bridge
in the hudson
there fewer ships cleaner water
you know if youre about to tell me
to look on the bright side
im about to hit you in the head
with a peanut butter sandwich
sorry
force of habit
you know i keep telling everybody
they should move on and
grow
some do
but not us
if i move on who does this
maybe it doesnt need to be done
i used to have nothing
and then i got this
this job
this family
and i was
i was better because of it
and even though
theyre gone
now im still trying to be better
i think we both need to get a life
you first
hi hi
is anyone home
this is scott lang
we met a few years ago
at the airport
in germany
i was the guy that got really big
and i had my mask on
you would not recognize me
is this an old message
ant-man
ant-man i know you know
i know you know that
it the front gate
i need to talk to you guys
scott
are you ok
yeah
have either of you guys ever
studied quantum physics
only in mid-conversation
alright so
five years ago
right right before
thanos
i was in a place called
the quantum realm
the quantum realm is like its
own microscopic universe
to get in there you have to be
incredibly small
hope she my
she was she was my
she she was supposed
to pull me out
and then thanos happened and
i got stuck in there
sorry
that mustve been a long 5 years
yeah but that just it
it wasnt
for me it was five hours
see the rules of the quantum realm
arent like they are up here
everything is unpredictable
is that anybody sandwich
im starving
scott
what are you talking about
so
what im saying is
time works differently
in the quantum realm
the only problem is right now
we dont have a way to navigate it
but what if we did
i cant stop thinking about it
what if we could somehow control
the chaos and we could navigate it
what if there was a way
that we can enter
the quantum realm
at a certain point in time
but then exit the quantum realm
at another point in time
like
like before thanos
wait are you talking
about a time machine
no no of course not
no not a time machine
it more like a
yeah a time machine
i know it crazy it crazy
but i
but i cant stop thinking about it
there got to be
some wa
it crazy
scott
i get e-mails from a raccoon
so nothing sounds crazy anymore
so who do we talk to about this
chow-time
morgoona
morgan h stark
want some lunch
define lunch or be disintegrated
ok
you should not be wearing that ok
that is part of a special anniversary
gift im making for mom
there you go
are you thinking about lunch
i can give you a handful of crickets
on a bed of lettuce
no
that what you want
how did you find this
garage
really
were you looking for it
no
i found it though
you like going to the garage
so does daddy
it fine actually
mom never wears anything i buy her
so im gonna
no we know what it sounds like
tony after everything youve seen
is anything really impossible
quantum fluctuation messes
with the planck scale
which then triggers
the deutsch proposition
can we agree on that
thank you
in layman terms it means
youre not coming home
i did
no
you accidentally survived
it a billion-to-one cosmic fluke
and now you wanna pull a
what do you call it
a time heist
yeah a time heist
of course
why didnt we think of this before
because it laughable
because it a pipe dream
the stones are in the past
we could go back we could get them
we can snap our own fingers
we can bring everybody back
or screw it up worse
than he already has right
i dont believe we would
gotta say it
i sometimes miss that giddy optimism
however high hopes wont help
if there is no logical tangible way
for me to safely execute said
time heist
i believe the most likely outcome
will be our collective demise
not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel
it means no talking to our past
selves no betting on sporting events
im gonna stop you right there scott
are you seriously telling me
that your plan to save the universe
is based on back to the future
is it
no
good you had me worried there
because that would be horseshit
that not how quantum physics works
tony
we have to take a stand
we did stand
and yet here we are
i know you got a lot on the line
you got a wife a daughter
but i lost someone very important to me
a lotta people did
and now
now we have a chance
to bring her back
to bring everyone back
and youre telling me
that you wont even
that right scott i wont even
i cant
mommy told me to come
and save you
good job
im saved
i wish you were coming here
to ask me something else
anything else
im honestly happy to see you guys
i just
look the table set for six
tony i get it
and im happy for you i really am
but this is a second chance
i got my second chance right here cap
cant roll the dice on it
if you dont talk shop
you can stay for lunch
well he scared
he not wrong
yeah but i mean
what are we gonna do
we need him
what are we gonna stop
no i wanna do it right
were gonna need a really big brain
bigger than his
come on i feel like
im the only one eating here
try some of that
have some eggs
im so confused
these are confusing times
right no no no no
no that not what i meant
nah i get it im kidding
i know it crazy
im wearing shirts now
yeah what how why
five years ago we got our asses beat
except it was worse for me
because i lost twice
first hulk lost then banner lost
and then we all lost
no one blamed you bruce
i did
for years ive been treating the hulk
like he some kind of disease
something to get rid of
but then i start looking
at him as the cure
eighteen months in the gamma lab
i put the brains and the brawn together
and now look at me
best of both worlds
excuse me mr hulk
yes
can we can we get a photo
00% little person
come on step on up
do you mind

no it was great kids
thank you very much
hulk out
bruce
dab
bruce
listen to your mom
she knows better
about what we were saying
right
the whole time travel do-over
guys it outside of my area of expertise
well you pulled this off
i remember a time when
that seemed pretty impossible too
ive got a mild inspiration
id like to see if it checks out
so
id like to run one last sim
before we pack it in for the night
this time in the shape
of a mobius strip
inverted please
processing
right give me the eigenvalue
of that particle
factoring in spectral decomp
thatll take a second
just a moment
and dont worry if it doesnt pan out
im just kinda
model rendered
shit
shit
what are you doing up little miss
shit
nope we dont say that
only mommy says that word
she coined it it belongs to her
why are you up
because ive got some important shit
going on here
why do you think
no i got i got something on my mind
i got i got something on my mind
was it juice pops
sure was
that extortion that a word
what kind you want
great minds think alike
juice pops exactly
was on
my mind
you done yeah
now you are
here wipe
good
that face goes there
tell me a story
a story
once upon a time
maguna went to bed the end
that is a horrible story
come on that your favorite story
love you tons
i love you 3000
3000 that crazy
go to bed or ill sell all your toys
night night
not that it a competition
but she loves me 3000
does she now
you were somewhere in the low
6 to 900 range
whatcha reading
just a book on composting
what new with composting
interesting science
i figured it out
by the way
and you know
just so were talking
about the same thing
time travel
what
that
amazing and
terrifying
that right
we got really lucky
yeah
i know
a lot of people didnt
nope and i cant help everybody
sorta seems like you can
not if i stop
i can put a pin in it right now and stop
tony
trying to get you to stop
has been one of the few failures
of my entire life
something tells me i should put it
in a lockbox and drop it
to the bottom of the lake
and go to bed
but would you be able to rest
ok here we go
time travel test number one
scott fire up the
van thing
breakers are set
emergency generators are on standby
good because if we blow the grid
i dont want to lose
tiny here in the 950s
excuse me
he kidding
you cant say things like that
just it was a bad joke
you were kidding right
i have no idea
were talking about time travel here
either it all a joke or none of it is
were good
get your helmet on
scott im gonna send you
back a week
let you walk around for an hour
then bring you back in 0 seconds
make sense
perfectly not confusing
good luck scott
you got this
youre right
i do captain america
on a count of three
three
two
one
guys
this
this doesnt feel right
what is this what going on
who is that
hold on
is that scott
yes it scott
what going on bruce
my back
what is this
hold on a second
could i get a little space here
yeah yeah yeah
can you bring him back
im working on it
it a baby
it scott
as a baby
hell grow
bring scott back
when i say kill the power
kill the power
oh my god
and
kill it
somebody peed my pants
thank god
but i dont know
if it was baby me or old me
or just me me
time travel
what
i see this as an absolute win
why the long face
let me guess he turned into a baby
among other things yeah
what are you doing here
it the epr paradox
instead of pushing lang through time
you mightve wound up
pushing time through lang
it tricky dangerous
somebody could have cautioned you
against it
you did
did i
well thank god im here
regardless i fixed it
a fully functioning time-space gps
i just want peace
turns out resentment is corrosive
and i hate it
me too
we got a shot
at getting these stones but
i got to tell you my priorities
bring back what we lost i hope yes
keep what i found
i have to at all costs
and maybe not die trying
would be nice
sounds like a deal
tony i dont know
why
he made it for you
plus honestly
i have to get it out of the garage
before morgan takes it sledding
thank you tony
will you keep that a little quiet
didnt bring one for the whole team
we are getting
the whole team yeah
were working on that right now
hey humie
where big green
the kitchen i think
that awesome
rhodey careful on re-entry
there an idiot in the landing zone
oh god
what up regular-sized man
kind of a step down
from the golden palaces
and the magic hammers and whatnot
hey have a little compassion pal
first they lost asgard
then half their people
theyre probably just happy
to have a home
you should not have come
valkyrie
great to see you
angry girl

either of the other ways

when he comes in for
supplies
it that bad
yeah

dont what
dont give me hope
im sorry i couldnt give it
to you sooner
youre drifting left
one side there lebowski
ratchet how it going
it rocket take it easy
youre only a genius on earth pal
time travel suit not bad
hey hey hey easy easy
im being very careful
no youre being very hulky
im being careful
these are pym particles alright
and ever since hank pym got
snapped out of existence this is it
this is what we have
were not making any more
scott calm down
sorry
weve got enough
for one round-trip each
that it
no do-overs
plus two test runs
one test run
alright
im not ready for this
im game
ill do it
clint now youre gonna feel
a little discombobulated
from the chronoshift
dont worry about that
wait a second
let me ask you something
if we can do this you know
go back in time
why dont we just find baby thanos
you know and
first of all that horrible
it thanos
and secondly
time doesnt work that way
changing the past
doesnt change the future
look we go back we get the stones
before thanos gets them
thanos doesnt have the stones
problem solved
bingo
that not how it works
well that what i heard
wait but who who told you that
star trek terminator timecop
time after time
quantum leap
wrinkle in time
somewhere in time
hot tub time machine
hot tub time machine
bill and ted excellent adventure
basically any movie
that deals with time travel
diehard no that not one
this is known
i dont know why everyone believes
that but that isnt true
think about it
if you travel to the past
that past becomes your future
and your former present
becomes the past
which cant now be changed
by your new future
exactly
so back to the future
is a bunch of bullshit
alright clint
were going in three
two
one
cooper
where are my headphones
lila
i never had them
lila
yeah you had them yesterday
lila lila
yeah dad
dad
lila
hey hey
hey look at me
you ok
yeah
yeah
it worked
it worked
ok so the how works
now we got to figure out the when
and the where
almost everyone in this room
has had an encounter
with at least
one of the six infinity stones
or substitute the word encounter
for damn near been killed
by one of the six infinity stones
well i havent
but i dont even know what
the hell youre all talking about
regardless
we only have enough pym
particles for one round-trip each
and these stones have been
in a lot of different places
throughout history
our history
so not a lot of convenient spots
to just drop in yeah
which means we have
to pick our targets
correct
so
let start with the aether
thor what do you know
is he asleep
no no
im pretty sure he dead
where to start
the aether
firstly is not a stone
someone called it a stone before
it more
of an angry sludge sort of a thing so
someone gonna need
to amend that and stop saying that
here an interesting story though
about the aether
my grandfather many years ago
had to hide the stone from
the dark elves
scary beings so jane
actually
there she is
yeah so jane was an
old flame of mine
you know she she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time
and and then the aether
stuck itself inside her
and she became very very sick
and so i had to take her to asgard
which is where im from
and we had to try and fix her
we were dating at the time
you see i got
i got to introduce her to my
my mother
who dead and
you know jane and i arent
even dating anymore so
yes these things happen though
you know
nothing lasts forever
the only thing that
why dont you come sit down
im not done yet
the only thing that is permanent
in life is impermanence
awesome
eggs breakfast
no id like a bloody mary
quill said he stole the power stone
from morag
is that a person
no morag a planet
quill was a person
like a planet like in outer space
look
it like a little puppy
all happy and everything
do you wanna go to space
you wanna go to space puppy
ill take you to space
thanos found
the soul stone on vormir

i know
where did you get this
bucky is alive
what
that is america ass
please please
im sorry i cant help you bruce
if i give up the time stone
to help your reality
im dooming my own
with all due respect alright
im not sure the science
really supports that
the infinity stones
create what you experience
as the flow of time
remove one of the stones
and that flow splits
now this may benefit your reality
but my new one not so much
in this new branch reality
without our chief weapon
against the forces of darkness
our world would be overrun
millions will suffer
so tell me doctor
can your science prevent all that
no
but we can erase it
because once were done
with the stones
we can return each one
to its own timeline
at the moment it was taken
so chronologically
in that reality
it never left
yes but youre leaving out
the most important part
in order to return the stones
you have to survive
we will i will i promise
i cant risk this reality on a promise
it the duty
of the sorcerer supreme
to protect the time stone
then why the hell
did strange give it away
what did you say
strange he gave it away
he gave it to thanos
willingly
yes
why
i have no idea
maybe he made a mistake
or i did
strange is meant to be the best of us
so he mustve done it for a reason
i fear you might be right
thank you
im counting on you bruce
we all are
run diagnostics
show me her memory file
sire the file appears entangled
it was a memory but not hers
there another consciousness
sharing her network
another nebula
impossible
this duplicate carries a time stamp
from nine years in the future
where is this other nebula
in our solar system on morag
can you access her
yes the two are linked
search the duplicate memories
for infinity stones
and these stones have been
in a lot of different places
throughout history
our history
so not a lot of convenient spots
to just drop in
which means we have
to pick our targets
correct
freeze image
terrans
avengers
unruly wretches
what that reflection
amplify this maw
i dont understand
two nebulas
no
the same nebula
from two different times

problem he couldnt solve with a belt
i thought my dad was tough on me
and now looking back on it

for one of you
for the other
in order to take the stone
you must lose that which you love
an everlasting exchange
a soul
for a soul
how it going
jesus

i dont think so
why because he knows
your daddy name

thanos left here with the stone
without his daughter

whatever it takes
whatever it takes

that impossible
and as long as there are those
that remember what was
there will always be those
that are unable
to accept what can be
they will resist

i know what i must do
i will
shred this universe
down to its last atom
and then
with the stones
youve collected for me
create a new one
teeming with life
that knows not what it has lost
but only what it has been given
a grateful universe
born out of blood
theyll never know it
because you wont be alive
