-----NewMovie-----
yeah
what
already
that too far ahead of schedule
jesus
yeah ill be right there
yeah im coming right now
laura
laura
what
we got to get to the base
something happened
everything okay
something serious
just meet me in the car in
5 minutes ill get tina
okay
dad what going on
hi baby
5 minutes meet me in the car
did you see what happening outside
what should we do
just stay calm i need you to pack an
overnight bag were going to the base
how long are we to be gone
not long
so i dont pack that much
i dont know baby
just get what you can and maybe
we come back for the rest
but i got to get to the
base as soon as possible
i want you there
with me okay
okay
come on laura
let go
what kelvin’s eta
somebody give me an answer asap
ive got a force launch going in the space
loaded with nukes way ahead of schedule
why is he not in here
his locator shows him
nearly 60 miles of-site
get an escort and get it to him now
yes sir
sir that blast came out of nowhere
another one like that might take
our launch systems off-line
recommendations
well the faster it gets up there
the sooner it comes down and gets reloaded
commence countdown
copy that countdown commenced
5 4 3 2
go
rockets firing
and we now lift off
the rocket is up sir
now get him in here
ryan can you slow down
i guess i shouldnt even bother asking
why were going to the base
i just cant laura
if you found out why then
i wouldnt be doing my job
thanks baby
that very reassuring
you are unbelievable
unbelievable
is that one of yours
go go
oh my god
are you kidding me right now
who was that why would people be after us
im not sure
not sure cause you dont know
or youre not sure
because it another
stupid government cover-up
im not sure because
i really dont know
and i really dont want to find out
with the two of you in the car
everybody hold on
i think they shot the tires
what
oh my god
we gonna have to make a run for it
run
come on
go
go
go back
it a dead end
it a dead end
now everybody get out
go go
come on
go go
hurry
dr kelvin
what are you doing with nuclear weapons
dr kelvin
what is he talking about
what
in the last year
you have made 7 trips
to the international space station
armed with bombs
why
okay
you gotta run okay
were all in danger the whole world
yes by your actions
mr kelvin
professor kelvin
there is one more
henreaux
henreaux
what took you so long
we got here as quick as we could sir
dont worry mrs kelvin
i have agents taking care of you and your
daughter before this project is finished
ill make all the arrangements myself
get them to the base
theyll be safe there
yes sir
i cant believe we were in danger
and you didnt tell us
i didnt know
honestly
nobody outside the project
was supposed to know anything
well baby obviously somebody found out
i just
i just
how long
tell me when it gonna be over
and when were gonna be safe
a month
one month
one way or another
itll all be over i promise
okay
mam
i am agent green
this is my partner agent dunne
we have a car waiting
okay
mam’
sir
catch ya
my wife my daughter myself
whatever these guys found out from my side
would have killed us afterwards
you know it one thing for
me to put my life on the line
whoever inside the project leaked the
information out well plug the leak
well please do it before it gets more out
of hand before it gets out to the public
before it causes worldwide panic
professor kelvin
capt james moto air force office of
special investigations
hi
ive been assigned to go through your
computer systems
emails im blog posts you know
anything containing information ways
you know enough about the project
to know what youre looking for
well yeah i know that the
small burst of radiation
that have been hitting planet earth
the past couple of years
is supposed to be prelude to a full
blast supernova that coming in over us
not supposed to be about it
based on analysis weve been
getting the spitzer space telescope
there gonna be enough gamma radiation
for a planet-killing catastrophe
i need to go check on the space platform
the climate will go haywire
everything controlled by
electricity will be fried
communications water and you name it
the earth will turn into
a radioactive wasteland
that how long we have
until the blast hits us
and there is nothing that can
be done to stop it
that what this project is all about
another hand to help us
with our calculations
capt moto professor huan ye of china
the people republic of china
professor dzerzhinsky of russia
the people republic of vodka
ye and i have been going over the
calculations for nuclear missile launches
and i think that we will have to alter
each launch by a few milliseconds
in order for pattern to sustain cloud
we have to re-program the us missile
launch codes in order to
match the timing of ours
or you could just let us do it
im sure my government would be about
as happy about that as yours would
message me the new codes
what a shame
with so much at stake youd think we could
make decisions that
would benefit our own mutual interest
perhaps it in all our mutual
interest that we study all the data
and make our decision based on that
touché
i dont care
i just hope that when
we launch those nukes
that the cloud shield will protect the earth
as much as possible
magnetosphere is earth natural barrier
against radiation
but our data show that the
incoming radiation would be too strong
for the magnetosphere to handle so
were gonna help mother nature out
there are two schools of thought
on where to explode the nukes
inside the magnetosphere
and outside the magnetosphere
honestly unless we cant
get more nukes up there
neither of these plans are gonna cut it
let me ask you a question
you trust these guys
i have to
were all gonna be up on that space platform
together controlling the missile launches
i wish we could launch them from down here
but
without the earth
gravitational pull we can
pinpoint the launches right
where we want them and
and detonate them more quickly
what happens if one the bursts
fries the platform electronics
well
weve had them retro-fitted
with radiation shield
like we did on the space shuttle so
let’s hope that doesnt happen
where is it
mrs kelvin
tina are you sure you havent seen it
i thought you had it last
i cant remember
mrs kelvin
it gotta be here somewhere
ms kelvin
what
im not leaving here without
her mom necklace okay
mrs kelvin
what
we did you the courtesy
of coming back here
we are on a tight timetable and
we need to escort you to base
now
0 more minutes
and were leaving
your father told me he hid it in some
stupid hiding place that only he knows
you know you really need
to cut him some slack
he has some pretty big
things on his mind
youre right
will you help me look
and there you go my man gin
oh come on
you know youll need male
equipments to be an astronaut
funny funny funny
okay theyre loading the nuclear
warhead on the shuttle now
this is it
the last one
let us do our part
to save the world again
let me see
for the nuclear cloud shield
to be strong enough to last this
the entire supernova burst
we should have more
warheads that we thought
youre right
i wish that we had more
but given the time constraint
that we have and
the fact that we only have 3 shuttles
to carry everything to the platform i
yes
yes
i just wish we had
one more load of
of nuclear warheads
up there
because at this point
every shuttle especially this last one
will make a difference as to whether
our little nuclear shield will
protect the whole earth or not
look i know
but were just gonna do the best with
what weve got and hope that it works
a massive earthquake has triggered
an infamous volcano
in italy back into activity
now two thousand years later mount
vesuvius has reared its head once again
burying hundreds of square
kilometers in ash and pumice
guess what i found
thanks
what wrong sweetie
are you kidding me
we almost got murdered this morning
and now we are supposed to
get in the car and go right back into it
i know i just
i dont know what else to do
why cant he just stay here with us
why cant he just be here
sweetheart it just
like you said it just
he got a lot on his plate right now
shed know what to do
yeah
i know she would
when is it gonna stop
let just hold on
let go
let go
come on get the two let get out of here
come on
from here on out
stronger energy bursts are
going to hit earth and
and worse it will beget
the shuttle
please tell me the platform
is intact
im sorry dr kelvin but im not
sure were gonna be able to launch it
there could be problems
launch structure now
we dont have any other choice
those warheads have to
get up on the platform
or parts of the earth are gonna go
unprotected and destroyed by radiation
okay ill have the structure
gone over again but
i know i know
everyone is aware of the risk
please do it
ill find out when the
after-shocks are gonna hit so
we can schedule the
next launch
alright good thanks i
i gotta take
care of something else now
ryan
thank god
yeah we are okay
the house was destroyed in the
earthquake
no no were okay
yeah we are on our way there now
agents are right in front of us
they are keeping an eye on us
good good just
do what they tell you and
everything will be alright
okay i will
i love you too
brace yourself
look out
the tremors feel like they
is it over
i think so
laura
ryan
what happened laura
ryan
ryan
ryan
i can hardly hear you
oh my god
professor kelvin
im sorry what
the next after-shock wont hit for hours
i spoke with nasa
and they okayed the launch structure so
theyre gonna go ahead as scheduled
good
let’s pray nothing else happens
between now and then
sir
what is it
were picking up a major
surge in energy particles
about to reach the earth atmosphere
that almost four hours
ahead of our calculations
we have to get a hold of
launch control and see if
there any way we could
stop them from launching
if the shipments of warheads
doesnt make it up there
we wont have enough to protect
us against the full supernova burst
it not much we can do about it now
the launch is a go in 3
mission control
mission control can you read me
mission control please respond
that flight had to happen
we needed those warheads
we have to re-compute
the missile launch pattern
now that we dont have as many
as we need
let get an uplink
ill run a full diagnostic to see if
there any damage on the platform
that is if the energy
burst will let us through
i will re-check energy burst
to try to figure out
why we were so far off in calculating speed
dr kelvin
what
based on our newest data
that we are getting now our
our calculations on
when the supernova will arrive
are off by more than 24 hours
jesus
but that could change
it could get shorter if the
stronger blast that comes right before the
supernova is moving faster than we think
and i think we should take another look
at where we are going to do the explosions
inside or outside magnetosphere
you know my feelings on this and
the reason i believe we need
to create the shield outside it
yes but i just did a
new computer simulation of
the nuclear explosions with fewer warheads
and molecules will stay more
tightly bound together
if the explosions occur
inside the magnetosphere
not outside it wont
be as effective
and if we explode the warheads
inside the magnetosphere
we run the chance of destroying
the earth atmosphere
changing the climate and destroying
this planet as we know it
oh please
i think we need to concentrate
on the immediate threat
the supernova
we cant just trade off one form of
the earth being destroyed for another
that only if we accept your theory
you do not know what will
happen anymore than i do
got a second
ive been running through all
the internet traffic
in and out here for the
past couple of days
i found that someone sent out a message
to a blind email account
professor ryan kelvin is
the one in charge of
putting nuclear weapons into
space for the us government
it no wonder that the iranians came after
me any idea who signed in to this computer
you did
or someone using
your name and password
look somebody’s being smart
is there any way that i when i
my username signs in to use a program
that we attach a voice id and a password
sure no problem
take care of yourself
oh
one oth i mean if you can
ive been trying to get a hold of my wife
all day and it just nothing but static
i can use a signal booster and
see if that will do the trick
thanks cause im just
with the earthquake i
dont worry about it
im on it right now
okay
it stuck
the links are probably down
just an after-shock
hello
got it
laura
thank god ive been trying
get through to you
the agents were killed
in the earthquake
where are you
youre still on your way right
were trying to get
to the air base but
the bridge is blocked so
we cant get through
you okay
are you sure
yeah im worried ive been
trying to get a hold of you
maybe you shouldnt try to meet me here
i dont know what to do
we cant keep driving
no what i was thinking is
maybe youd meet me at patterson
there is an underground secure
facility there it where all the
shuttle launch computers are
where all the nasa higher-ups are going
because we had it special radiation treated
meet me at the fall out okay
so
we heard on the news about
the supernova that true
yes
me not talking to you the last few years
i couldnt
there something else i want to talk to
you about but not on the phone okay
meet me at the fallout shelter
okay hum
tell them to expect us okay
baby i love you
i love you too
when they get to the gates
theyre gonna use his name
what i want you to do is assign them a
secure living quarter until he gets there
youre a good man
i got it setup now so any time your
password logs onto a computer
somebody gonna need to
register a voice command
before the computer does anything
one less thing to worry about
laura look out
who taught you how to drive
the heat is really climbing
i cant believe that
storm caught up to us
get in let get outta here
it keeps getting closer
i know
ive never seen clouds
move so fast
look out
laura
okay dont touch anything any metal
will be electrified
it okay
i think well be alright
the cab like a faraday cage
thank god the windows are rolled up
the electricity will find a
way to the ground in a second
you are your father’s daughter arent you
the faraday cage isnt enclosed anymore
it means
that electricity can get us now
alright uh
maybe we can get a ride
get out
now
we have to get away from the car
it will attract the lightning
alright go there
go
stay away from trees
they attract lightning the most
remind me to thank your father
oh god
even if the lightning doesnt get us
one of those feelers still could
were gonna be okay
were gonna be okay
oh god laura
come on
great the launch computers on
the platforms are not responding
we cant get through to them
i can communicate with other systems
onboard just not those
it a good thing we have
back-ups that is functioning right
dont we
ill go over it to make
sure that it is
but it has to gonna come onboard
with us on the shuttle
wait it needs to be
programmed with the latest data
and you have to run
that test-fire simulation
to make sure of its launch capabilities
the speed of the energy burst
is increasingly hitting us
means that the launch computer
will have to reconfigure
time space and location
of missile launches
and destination second by second
we are almost just guessing how
fast the supernova is really moving
until it is right about to hit us
moto
im gonna be down at a-3
do me a favor will you
keep trying to get a hold of my wife
kelvin ryan project head
are all the electric power turned
on to the platform mark-up
yes sir
i heard that you had
a problem
it kind of makes me wonder if god
wants us interfering with his plans
right now i wonder how the grapevine
around here knows about mine
okay
come on baby i dont
need any more problems now
let check the control panel
great at least the
emergency system works
kelvin
kelvin
kelvin
fuck
kelvin it me henreaux
come on sit down
you okay
you got any idea
who attacked you
no just
what they were after just
someone dressed in black and kicked
my ass in a real professional way
how long was i out
20 minutes maybe
if someone wanted to sabotage this project
they could have destroyed
this with the replacing panel
or they just wanted
to get rid of you
it gotta be someone
inside this project
but after what
there been no unauthorized access
but im cross-checking the
password and log-in now
where motto
he dead
he came looking for you with a message but
he ran into your man in black instead
jesus
dead
it is desperate
do whatever you can
yes
goodbye
where is ye
did the simulation work
you both been here the
whole time since i left
i was gone a few minutes to
pick up some sandwiches but
why didnt moto find you
you saw moto
he was here
he was looking for you he said
your wife called and that
she needed your help
desperately
time is growing shorter
it looks like the lightning stopped
for right now
how are we gonna get to the base
howdy
you all get lost
all em fire is burning
because of the heat and lightning
hey do you happen to have a phone
we can use
sure do
if it still working
this heat
the two of you must be pretty desperate
to get somewhere to be out in this on foot
we had a car
but the storm
were trying to get to my dad
before he takes off on the space shuttle
he working on that big project
ryan
laura
where are you
why havent you gotten to patterson yet
what
listen were
were okay for right now but
i dont know if were gonna
make it to patterson
im coming to get you guys
no
baby you cant leave
project now
look i have to see you
baby i want to see you too
more than anything but
listen i know that you have
to do what youre doing
okay you have a job to do and
there too much at stake for
you should leave now
i cant leave you out
there unprotected laura
somehow well
well be fine
really
you know that cave that we
went exploring out during our vacation
well go in there
therell be protection
well be fine
honey
i havent told you my part
it up on the space platform
launching the missiles
if any part of the supernova burst
makes it trough the platform it wont
look honey if i havent
told you enough lately or
if you ever doubted
i know baby
i know
i just want you to know
that i love you so much
hi dad
hey kiddo
hey uh
if you guys cant make it to
the base in the next couple of hours
i need you to find
some deep cover okay
a mine shaft or a cave or something
understand
yeah i will
i will
i will do what can
but i need you and laura
to find a safe spot okay
dad
you know if you want to get to that cave
it not gonna be a good idea for
you to try it out on foot
that old truck of mine aint much but
but it ought to get you there okay
what about you
come with us youre not
gonna be safe here
where am i gonna go
ive lived here my whole life
ill die here
so this is the truck i was
telling you guys about
thank you so much
no need
glad to help
i was having a second idea here
im thinking maybe only one
of you should go
i think maybe she should stay
excuse me
there no reason for
both of you to go really
and id like for her to stay
besides for the weather the way it is
who knows if we even have tomorrow
so what do you say
i think maybe you and i could
really get to know each other
ill call you back
things bad or worse than expected
i just faced my own mortality a
little quicker that i wanted to
im not too
happy about that
how are you feeling physically
look i feel like atlas
with the world on my shoulders
only that the world is crushing me
i want the leak
i want whoever killed moto found
alright sweep the place
bugs taps on my computer everything
yes sir
right away
we lost more time huh
based on the speed of this latest bursts
that our new time
at this rate we will have to
make launch to space platform
more quicker than i thought
a lot more quicker
then i better finish the simulation
on that replacement panel
you trying to test em
when im in the platform mock-up
i want remote surveillance
no security actually inside the hangar
so if someone wants to come after me
and find something out that fine
we need to find out who they are
and what they want as soon as possible
were running out of time
kelvin ryan project head
it like the apocalypse is coming
wow what happening
the gust keep picking up
it like flying into a head wind
how much longer til we get
to this cave were going to
we should be there by morning
i hope it not that way
oh my god
if we cant get off here
well have to turn around
look out
i see it
maybe we should do
what theyre doing and
go back
we cant go back that way well be trapped
okay but do you see a cutoff or anything
look around
im looking im looking
there i can see
god
were not gonna make it
were gonna make it
put your head down
let get outta here
let go
come on
no attacker
well were not gonna
get another chance
we got the word to move you to
the shuttle launch site in one hour
it the atmosphere
it getting more unstable by the hour
so if we dont go up now
we might not make it to the platform
any luck on getting a hold
on my wife and daughter
sorry too much
interference
alright youd better pack up the
computer replacement panel
im gonna have a word
with dzerzhinsky and ye
hey buddy you okay
yeah
youre gonna be fine
that was a hell of an earthquake
bring a medical team down here right away
roger that
somebody gonna be here
just be calm
doc you can you
give me a hand
yeah let me put this case down
ill be right back
kelvin ryan project head
are you alright
where is dzerzhinsky
in the control room weve been
getting ready to leave
great
all those satellites giving
us data are gone
the only place to measure
speed of supernova is platform
hurry up; we gotta get ready to go
there is no telling how
short time we have
until the boom
have you been here the whole time
yes i tried to get signal trough
to the platform but could not
for all i know it might not be working
wonderful
weve got problems
more
that earthquake was centered
30 km off the coast
it may have destroyed
the shuttle platform
let us finish get packed up just
get us some transportation
right away
you okay
we did it
let go kiddo
not beaten yet
you think you can fix this
well see there only so
much that can go wrong with
an internal combustion engine
will you go in the back
and see if there a
a screwdriver or something
careful careful
try it again
try again
go ahead and try
one more time
nice
ive already told you
there no way we can do it
the launch is scrapped
but the shuttle is on the launch pad
it could be launched and weve got
no other choice except to try
that just the problem
it cant be launched
the electromagnetic storm have wrecked
irrevocable havoc on all our systems
so it the control panel
gone nothing working
you still got power dont you
well the emergency generator system
alright then hook it
directly to the shuttle
create a makeshift control panel
and get ready to do it manually
you gotta be kidding
you know how many variables are
involved with the rocket firing sequence
just keeping them stabilized
is difficult enough
you people have fired off enough shuttles
by now to be able to do it in your sleep
take the training wheels
off and do it manually
is it possible
the earthquake could have damaged
the launch structure too
i mean i dont know
it scares the shit outta me too
but either way
if we dont go up there were gonna die
anyone else have a better idea
still believe in the
hand of god dzerzhinsky
god’s great hand
sweeping across the
universe to destroy all of mankind
why dont you just
let me enjoy cigarette
before i go blow myself
up in that machine
all lines are busy
if they cant complete this soon
then it doesnt matter anyway
she is very correct
just using
acceleration factor of burst
so far is baseline
i would have to say
that we have only about
eight hours till
supernova burst
it too bad our people republic
space program wasnt further along
because we would have
planned this much better
for us to not have
problems like this
you may have had
better planning but
you would still need russian
engineering in order to do better
as long as were talking about planning
id like to reexamine
where were going to
explode the warheads
that has already been decided
it already been decided based on numbers
the electromagnetic and
molecular interaction
but not in how the
magnetosphere works
we already know what you think about
how it will affect the earth
im not talking about climate effects
im talking about the best
way to use it as a shield
look
we have two shields
against the supernova burst
the magnetosphere
and the nuclear cloud shield
based on molecular interaction
with constant warheads explosions
the nuclear cloud
will defiantly be the
stronger of the two
against the supernova
gamma radiation
and i agree
based on the numbers it will hold
together a little more strongly
if we position it inside
the magnetosphere
okay but how the
magnetosphere works
its self-sustaining
it can take smaller energy bursts
and to recover quickly
which means
with the cloud shield outside of it
then the magnetosphere will act as
a constant second shield
to catch the radiation the
cloud shield misses
but if the magnetosphere takes
the full burst of the supernova first
disrupting its flow
it wont be able to regenerate
and all that will be left
is the one shield the cloud shield
to protect the earth
this is what important
the strength of the cloud shield
the numbers supports it
the scientific community agrees
i dont think we should
change things now
even if we wanted to
there no time to program the
new sequences into
the launch computer
i still have
no
we are sticking with the plan
are you ready
no
but that not gonna stop us
alright
if you really wanna do this
get your gear
all systems
it powered up
check
cabin pressure
020 psi
exterior air temperature 34 degrees
were not supposed to launch
if it over 99
seeing how we dont even know if the
platform up there
so that the least of our worries
were all set
okay commence countdown
im proud to stand along with you
on this new battlefield
an arena we have
never encountered
we sit on the brink
of annihilating
and i speak to you now
not just as your president
but as a fellow citizen of
united states and the entire world
by now you all know the ensuing
supernova and the consequences it may bring
it is an event this world
will not soon forget
let our hearts and
our minds guide us
but not let them limit or consume
us with greed and selfpreservation
but let us instead become infected with
goodwill and love toward our fellowman
let this be our finest hour
if it is to be our last
remember hope
remember your loved ones
and those who came before us
remember the legacy and what
they have given us
and if it be god will
may he preserve us all
rocket booster de-tatch
our trajectory is off by 2 degrees
without nasa control guiding us
im pretty amazed were doing this good
we are at the edge of the shield
the ship can make it
it coming apart
what what are you doing
increasing the thrust as it
get us through the ionosphere
electric storm is not good
it getting worse
another charge
i found the receiver
the space platform
it
what is it
we ran out of gas
alright
let see if we
can get some
hey we ran out of gas
can you help us out
there is no escaping this is there
were all gonna die
stop it
stop it
listen to me
we can make it
we can we have a really good chance
of surviving
but if we gonna do that
we need to do it together okay
i need you to be strong and i need
your help you can do that
you can do that right
yes
okay
you have to make the adjustments
on the replacement panel
time before energy
burst hitting us
tells me we only have 28 minutes before
you know
how long
28 minutes
let’s hope this place
has 28 minutes left
the panel is fried
but there still juice
we got 27 minutes
okay i think i got it
go ahead program the launch codes
while i get my laptop up and running
section b is not just breeched
it gone
i got it closed down
but no telling which one is next
hurry
okay
the sequence couplings are frozen
the missiles arent gonna deploy
unless i do manually
i think i got it
initiate the firing sequence
dzerzhinsky
dzerzhinsky
come on
dzerzhinsky
youll never change
launch sequence
all i need is your eyeball

mrs kelvin
i had to come myself
there is someone
you have to talk to
hello
ryan
ryan
yeah i can hear you
supernova
an exploded star
the genesis of life itself on
a collision course with our planet
dzerzhinsky once told me it
was like god great hands
sweeping across the universe
intenting to destroying all mankind
a cosmic broom meant to clear
the way for something new
god will or not
it came from deep in space
and felt terror
and isolation of being alone
what does man do when its
back is against the wall
ye tried to change the codes to
protect the eastern hemisphere more heavily
helping to ensure the
perseveration of her people
thinking back it hard
to blame anyone for that
when i returned to a hero welcome
i said that ye and dzerzhinsky died
saving not only my life
but the lives of billions
we weren’t prepared
we didnt see it coming
but we found a way
the nuclear shield held
but not without its own consequences
the world has changed
but were still here
and stronger for it
when all the pretents melts away
youre finally able to hold on
to what important

in no time
im holding you responsible
for whoever going

youll start melting the metal
and youll be burning
the whole place down
how do you know
my father in the trade

just coming over here
what on the other side
of this door
a way out i was hoping
you
what your name

im rowan
if anyone gives a shit
were here for a reason
what is that
a reason
theyre plans to a vault
inside the matheson museum
the what
it
it in cleveland
are we supposed to go
to cleveland
wait
are we in cleveland
what in the name of jesus
are we doing in cleveland
where were you last
new york
arizona you
toronto vacation
someone went to a lot of trouble
to bring us here
so whatever the score is
it gotta be worth it
score huh
i dont know
what youre talking about
im a law-abiding citizen
contracting right
that the one
but if this were a score
what would it be
i dont know
great reality tv
kiss my bollocks big brother
high explosive
semtex maybe
christ it enough
to take down the whole building
where the hell is it
i guess were supposed
to figure that out
why the hell do you keep running
toward all the scary shit
who the hell is this guy
hey
hey
you wanna tell us
what youre doing here
same thing youre doing
id imagine
trying to get out of here alive
you tried to escape
gerry youre late
and i have a schedule to keep
youre cutting it awfully close
youve had months
have you ever known me
to let you down
this isnt exactly the plan
we signed up for
why you here gerry
because theyre worried
because it tonight
and because i wanna make damn
sure our investment is safe
is it
look for yourself
you know ive been
doing this a long time
and if there one thing
ive learned
it that people
are who they are
i look at this
and i wonder
what makes you think that theyre
going to do what you want them to do
well because they have
no choice
because they are
who they are
what this
im not the one who going to have
to pay if this doesnt work out
always nice to chat theo
lovely to see you too gerry
no thank you
anybody mind
i was out in the hallway
i was looking for a way out
all hell broke loose
you didnt feel like
coming out to say hello
oh
let just say im a bit shy
by nature
and i wanted to know
who i was dealing with first
you satisfied
entirely
what so funny
well you have to admire
the humor of this situation
i mean four thieves
locked up
and we havent even committed
a crime yet
thieves you know
ill have you know
im a contractor
of course you are my dear
now listen up kids
if you wanna know what going
on take a good look around you
were all players
experts in our field
get to the point
you wanna
know the point big guy
the point is were all
career criminals
and this is a four-man crew
the mechanic rough brawny
and you dear lady
graceful nimble
youre the b&e specialist
we called them cat burglars
back in my day
and that leaves you
you slick-fingered devil
the safe cracker
what does that make you
smart guy
i guess that makes me
the smart guy
so
anybody figure out what
were supposed to steal yet
you pricks did your homework
who are you
well ill start with
the more infamous first
boston museum
8th of march 990
nah
oh yes
the frames of the pictures
are still hanging on the wall
no way that was you
grayson bishop
and it most certainly was
in fact i still have
one of the van goghs
hidden in a basement
somewhere to prove it
so an old-school
master thief huh
maybe youre the one
behind this
teach yourself a few new tricks
i seriously doubt there
is anything you can teach me
besides do you think
i would try to blow myself up
this doesnt make any sense
why us
well im the very best
at what i do
and im assuming you are
as well
otherwise i would be
completely insulted
it would be easier
to hire us no
maybe
or maybe it someone who knows
that we would never work for them
or better yet
maybe it someone
that wanted us fucked over
like who
do you got any enemies kid
because believe me
i have a long list
dont call me kid
you old fogy
you make me glad im an orphan
and an angry one at that
so what are we gonna do
we live or we die
doesnt sound like
much of a choice to me
excellent conclusion dear
harris
it so good to see you
what this
our border guy he reliable
right
he is
weve used him before
you paid top dollar
he was instructed to turn off the
cameras was he not
yes sir
by you
yes i told him
ill fix it
there is no fixing it harris
ill ill figure it out
ill talk
ill talk to him
you weigh
about 75 kilograms
is that right
yeah
shouldnt take too long
and please
just dont fight it
it easier that way
see harris every piece
has a purpose
and every move has a meaning
and if you cant follow
the rules
everyone loses
youre in charge now
and be careful decontaminating
we have to gain access
though the main elevator
then we have to open a security
door with an electronic lock
next we navigate a tunnel
secured by motion sensors
then unbreakable
tempered glass
once through
it the vault room
which brings us to the custom
970s mosler
even if you could do all that
which you cant
what your exit plan
i was thinking id just walk
out the front door
it kinda the point of
not setting off any alarms
that much security
what in the vault
gold
bonds
it diamonds
what
it diamonds
and it all started right here
john d rockefeller
son of a con artist
became one of
the wealthiest men in america
so he had diamonds
a lot of diamonds
hidden assets
from the government i assume
anyway theyre all stored
right here in the museum
at least for now
i mean they move em around
from time to time
it was last rumored
that they were in italy
florence to be exact
how do you know
it about the mosler
you see
it a bit of a legend
in certain rarefied circles
it never been cracked yet
though it has been tried
sounds like a bunch of bullshit
could be but our captor
believes it true
so then what do they
want us to do
draw them a map
theyve already got
the blueprints
they want us to steal it
no
they want us to pretend to
how that
for a slice of humble pie
it right this way guys
and why should i
trust you pops
maybe youre walking us
to an early grave
this whole place is a grave
you shouldnt trust me
i dont trust you
i mean
after all we are criminals
youre a real ray of
sunshine you know that
and youre a shoe size
passing for an iq dear boy
there it is
would you look at that
just like in the blueprints
they built a replica of
the museum
they want us to
practice the heist
theyre gonna watch our every
move and when were done
boom
and then
and then someone else
follows in our footsteps
and we are all okay with this
do you have any other options
shit
well i thought you were
the safe cracker
this isnt a safe it
a computer
no it not it a puzzle
it a henderson digital lock
it releases
the way it works it has four
bolts from the door to the frame
then we can use a gun
that unnecessary
oh yeah why is that
because this particular lock
depends on a person a person who
comes up with a four-digit pin
yeah well that like
a million different
combinations
permutations
and it 9999
give or take a fraction or two
but you see our advantage is
that henderson keypads
use silicone with
positive printing
what the hell does that mean
what that means is that
the surface clings
to the oil
from our fingertips
move over kid
youre blocking the view
all right
ah this should be easy
twenty-four permutations
voila
there it is
how did you know
the combo
i dont know the combo
i know people
and i know my keypads
yeah but the keypad at the museum
is not gonna be the same code
this is just a replica
well then it a good thing well
all be dead and it wont be us
actually the heist then
isnt it
im assuming the real security
system wont have an off switch
that where it is
that where they hid the bomb
they found the replica
theyre behind
what about grayson
played out just like
you said it would
he got everyone on task
and he cracked
the security code quick
and now
it showtime
i dont know why you
brought the whole tool shed
there nothing in there
to protect from lightsabers
what she on about
i can do this
do what
we need to redirect the laser
did you bring the mirror
and see
now it in front of me
your turn
shouldnt we be
motivating the others
i was just
looking for a weak spot
it hard work
leading a crew
im not leading anything
see it not just
about skills
it about personalities
you know mag
she strong and silent
bruised
but very reliable
and rowan
he a joker
but he knows his shite
and me
im the wiseass wise man
what about you kate
what are you gonna
bring to the party
that gonna take us
to the promised land
im not taking you anywhere
i dont know you
i know you
should we cut the crap
excuse me
your bingham paxton
granddaughter
corsica cabal
you dont know what
youre talking about
spoken like a career criminal
there no point
in us lying to each other
were all in this together
you mind me asking
how did he get pinched
your grandfather was a brilliant
man and i was an admirer
it was a job
italy
i was trying to crack a vault
and i took too long
police were supposed to be
diverted but
i escaped with the rest
of the crew
my grandfather
took the fall
what kind of vault
what kind of vault kate
it important
a mosler
a mosler
this was your grandfather
final score
he died in prison
didnt he
and it all your fault
you think you have
the answers to everything
listen to me
we do not have to do
what they want us to do
you and i could figure
something out
we dont have
to play their game
i dont have to play
your game either
i dont think you understand
the variables here
were pawns
were pawns in something
much bigger
hey
were ready
rowan got an idea
for the glass
all right here the news
prorated 0-hour
tempered glass
steel can be cut
stone can be broken
but this
this some new age
super-human shit
it the kind insurance
companies love to see
now the vibration might be able to
undermine the strength of the glass
you said it would break
there not even a dent
no
what i said was
we might be able to weaken it
we need a minute
hell with this
ill join you
i thought you were supposed
to be some kind of an expert
christ will you back off
are all girls in arizona
this mean or is it just you
im from mexico
oh lemme guess
cancun acapulco
hone your skills breaking into
rich tourist hotel rooms
sinaloa
oh cartel country
no wonder youre so friendly
but i was raised
in the magical crew
so all my friends
are dead
fair enough
this is not about me
this is about kate
i overheard her
talking to grayson
she cabal
you dont say
granddaughter of the great bingham himself
hmm
and i do not trust her
well
trust is hard to come by
these days
i think that maybe
we should keep an eye on her
well im keeping
an eye on everyone
youre an idiot
if you are not scared of them
you should be
they could be behind this
and we have the cub in our den
and what exactly do you
want me to do about it
i wanna show them
that we are serious
come up with anything
pass me the uh splicer there
so what did you
and grayson talk about
a score you know
what else
play poker
no
well you should
youre a great liar
what
quick
what the hell
youre working with them
who
the cabal
i dont know
what youre talking about
i overheard you
talking to grayson
youre cabal
and they are behind this
why would they do that
they are the only ones with
the resources for this no
youre making a mistake
we need each other
if were gonna get outta here
i think
that maybe you need us
and they need you
in one piece
and maybe if theyre
worried about you
theyll pop open the door
only if they know that we are serious
what the hell is going on here
nothing important
just a small hiccup
in group trust
dont be absurd
what are you doing
take it easy old boy
we need her
she cabal
so what
she was cabal
she not anymore
believe me
when i tell you this
she is not the one
responsible for all this
how do you know
she would never we caught dead
working for scum
the likes of theodore thurlo iii
who the hell is
theodore thurlo iii
i mean did we get kidnapped
by a knight of the round table
he the man behind
this current predicament
and believe me
indirectly he has
a deep connection to you
bollocks mate
you were born in dublin
werent ya
yeah i was
theo had some crews there
back in the day
you see the one thing
you have to know about our boy
he doesnt like
to leave witnesses

of bodies left behind in dublin
when he pulled out
you did say you were an orphan
didnt you
and you my dear
you were part of
the magical crew
well of course
you dont have crew anymore
they all went the way
of the bullet except you
that a terrible shame
now isnt it
a street kid like you
raised in the gutter
i understand that theo used to recruit
all the urchins on the streets of mexico
only he didnt treat em
so good
you dont know what
youre talking about
oh i think i do
in fact i think dickens
wrote a book about it
scooped up
taught to steal
taught to kill
turned into something
that you absolutely despised
and then betrayed
and left for dead
hey hey hey hey
it okay
well that a hell
of a punch you got there
how do you know theo
what did he do to you
well it more like
what i did to him

let just say i got the first
punch in and won the day
and now he
taking his revenge
it all bullshit
you know that right
you dont know shit about us
well then let just say i came
up with a good cover story for you

smarter about what youre doing
if you plan on
getting out of here alive

grayson never was
a team player
i just meant he
the man was an artist
he pulled off the greatest
art heist in history
show some goddamn respect
gerry
please dont try to tell me
that this was part of the plan
it wasnt entirely unexpected
i have no idea what that means
what it means gerry
is that he fulfilled his role
and sometimes you have
to trade a pawn
to put your pieces
in the right position
just remember who
youre playing with
no more sacrifices
get me those diamonds
grayson went at it alone
and look wat happened to him
im not were not
gonna make the same mistake
if were gonna win this
we need to get through it
you have a choice to make
ive made mine
we either die in here
or we get out together
try it again
anything we can use
it shite garbage and junk
come on there
gotta be something
cut it sharper
again
okay try again
all right
bring me the drone
why
the camera got a memory card
again higher
try again
were not gonna have
time to make these adjustments
well done
whyd you do it
do what
rob those banks
was it for yourself
or for someone else
let just say
the irish system
for young lads without
a family isnt all that great
im sorry
pretty soon youll find your family on
the inside is worth a hell of a lot more
than whatever fucked up situation
you have on the outside
right
got it
a charlie swan
steel
steel
tungsten carbide
cobalt bollocks
nothing
it got an extremely high
surface compression
stress resistance
at least a nine on the mohs scale
what that
means it hard as hell
can anything cut though it
diamonds
but unless you got yourself
engaged lately
youre on the wrong end
of the vault for that
well anything else

you owe them your life
whatever happened to you
im sorry
but we need you
and im pretty sure
you need us as well

maybe
it a long shot
but it worth a try
look we have an idea
liquid nitrogen
no it it wont work
there a pressure
loaded firing pin
itll trigger the re-lock
and well never get it open
how much time do we have
twenty-one minutes

forty-five
sixty-three

you just worry about
the vault
you remember what
i showed you yeah
you sure you wanna do this
he threw us in a hole

or it could be a trap
he thinks were dead
he never gonna see us coming
not till the diamonds
are long gone
he here
who
theo
hold on
we might have a problem
kate
you look well
try it
it mortlach 935
your grandfather favorite
im not here for a drink
im here for the diamonds
arent we all darling
tell me something
what do you see
wealth and privilege
you know what i see
i see the lies
they tell in the morning
these people
theyre here to impress
to make a mark
to be seen
im not
what
here to be seen
dressed like that
they think
it an end to itself
but i just dont
have time for that
so what then hmm
what do you have time for
well i like to enjoy
the finer things
but the acquisition
of those things
that for them
im addicted to savoring
the subtleties kate
i love the game
just dont much care
for the prize
you really should try it
the king-pawn endgame
it a difficult position
tell me something kate
will you become a queen
i guess well find out
well game on
oh excuse me
no my fault
enjoy your evening
hmm
im here
elevator is on its way
left you a present inside
mag you there
i cannot find theo crew
keep looking
rowan im out
you ready to go
ah
mag is that you
who the fuck
rowan what the hell
are you doing
rowan
mag can you hear me
get in
give me the diamonds kate
oh i dont have them
on me
you never leave
the scene with a score
my grandfather
taught me that much
im not holding a carrot
if you kill me
your diamonds will be gone
i promise you that
so you dont care
about your own life
what about rowan
i just met rowan today
what makes
you think i care
because i know you kate
it why i picked you
it why i picked all of you
it why i allowed
you to escape
you knew wed escape
of course
but you tried to kill us
that was motivation
but the other team
there is no other team kate
just you every move you made
every action you took
you did it because i planned it
and i wanted it that way
you were pawns in
is this another
chess thing again
because i should mention
im more of a monopoly girl
thimble
top hat
i want the diamonds kate
you kill me you have nothing
i have rowan
and we can make him
talk eventually
but rowan doesnt know
where the diamonds are
it just me
and if i die
your diamonds are gone
that would be a mistake
for you
see there no way that you
financed this whole thing yourself
so im betting you had
a buyer
a buyer who fronted you
enough for this whole operation
the replica and all
and im gonna bet
that this buyer
isnt the type to just write
this off if you dont deliver
so am i close
the diamonds kate
if i dont tell you
where they are
no matter
what happens to me
theyll come for you
are there dice in chess
oh very well
kei call vince
let give kate a little taste
of what about to come

certainly too much for
the police to handle
that where people like us come in
oh im bob west by the way
private detective
excuse me can you tell me
where flash street is please
yeah you go through
the first set of traffic lights
to the second set and then you turn left
thanks mate
all right
you see the trouble with most people
today is theyre not observant
they walk around with their eyes closed
and that just what
the criminal type looking for
this is where i work
if ever there was a glamorous job
this has got to be it
fast cars private yachts
flying off to assignments
in exotic places fantastic
not that i do any of that but the bloke
i work for he does it all the time
and of course need i say it women
you know i have never known a fellow
cram so many beautiful women into one day
my boss goes through secretaries
like a chain-smoker
this one only started this morning
amateur peering through keyholes
is for the amateur
i wasnt actually mr blake
i just thought id dropped
something on the floor
bugging now that the professional way
bugging
yes and like everything else
purely a matter of technique
now you stick with me and youll soon
learn to be a successful bugger
hurry up miss walker
i want to be out of here in five minutes
case robert case
you mean you want me to handle one
while youre away mr blake
no i want you to hand me one now
my briefcase

i trust im doing the right thing
leaving you in charge
of this office while im away
ill handle things while youre away
mr blake dont worry about that
watch it that just it
i dont want you to handle things
just keep an eye on the place
that will be quite sufficient
well
is there nothing i can do
while youre away
i mean finish off a case or something
to work on even the simplest of cases
requires a vast reservoir of experience
ive been here three months
im talking of years robert years
you havent even asked me
to follow anybody yet
i shall be gone for about four days
any problems you know where to
contact me hotel majestic beirut
by the way ive arranged for a temporary
secretary to deputise for miss walker
she should have been here
first thing this morning but she late
right miss walker
dont worry about a thing mr blake
ill make sure
everything running smoothly for you
look just take the messages that all
dont start messing in things
which dont concern you
no i wouldnt dream of it
come on
have a nice time
hello
thatll be the new secretary i bet
oh i can just see her now
soft blonde hair
lovely slender little body
deep sensitive eyes
gubbidge maud gubbidge
im the new secretary from rent-a-temp
rent-a-what
there must be a mistake i mean
this is the blake detective agency
isnt it
i was told to report to a mr west
is that you
well yeah but i was expecting
somebody a bit
older
well
now the last boss i had
he kept making improper suggestions to me
i hope youre not going to be like that
like what
keep making improper suggestions
oh no way
good as long as the only thing i have
to take down is shorthand i dont mind
you see it was my body
that was the trouble
yeah i can see that
he couldnt keep his hands off it
really
it got so bad it was just unbearable
so i had to hand in my notice
he said i aroused his primeval impulse
i seem to have that effect on men
you know
well if you wouldnt mind
answering the door please miss er
gubbidge maud gubbidge
yes what do you want
blake detective agency
thatll be all right miss garbage
gubbidge
yes yes if youd like to step this way
mr judd blake
well
laura sutton
how do you do
mr blake
ill come straight to the point
i want you to handle a case
for me immediately
oh yes but im not
no no no ill explain
you see i used to be
a professional model
and to be quite honest
i led a rather wild life
that is until i met ashley
ashley dotrice
then it was love at first sight
the fact that he was 87
a multi-millionaire
with a bad heart condition
had nothing to do with it naturally
naturally
but you see the thing is im not
and last week
we were supposed to be married
but i thought it best
we didnt have a long engagement
i mean hed already had
three heart attacks since last christmas
last week he had a fourth and died
oh im very sorry
hmm oh yes of course
i was terribly upset
now the point is that im due to inherit
his entire estate on the 25th
that very nice but the thing is
yes but you see the trouble is ashley
darling ashley you see he was under the
impression that i was still virgin
oh really
really
according to the terms of the will
i only inherit everything
if ive done nothing to bring
the family name into disrepute
so you see i have a problem
problem
well
i have a number of explicit photographs
of myself
with a gentleman in
a compromising situation
oh
i would like you to see them
oh yeah id love to yeah
i feel i should explain
well just pass them over
and let me have a look
you see they came through the post
yesterday morning
yes well
i think i should take a look and
they came with a note
threatening to send them
to ashley solicitor unless i pay 50000
yes well i can see
youve got a problem there
but if i could just have a look at them
mr blake im at my wits end
oh come on they cant be that bad
wow
exactly
needless to say
i dont have that kind of money
what
i said i dont have that kind of money
i cant touch any of the estate
until i inherit it on the 25th
and if i ask for some kind of a loan
then somebody might get suspicious
you know you photograph very well
thank you
what i want you to do is to catch
the blackmailer and get me the negatives
it incredible definition as well
you do see the position im in
youre in a very awkward position
i can see that
mr blake what do you think
oh i think theyre great
especially the one
with the stick of rock
yes well um
i think i should be able to fit you in
in between commitments
who do you reckon it is
if i knew who it was i wouldnt be here
employing you mr blake
yes quite
just testing you that all
well i think ill kick off by
following up a few leads
leads
yes you dont happen to have any do you
scott
who
the person on the picture
oh yes i hadnt noticed him
he a photographer
it could have been a set-up job but
yes well
you know i dont think
this is going to be
a particularly difficult
case to solve miss
sutton
just leave it with me for a few days
everything will be all right
oh dont worry
theyll be safely under lock and key
everything is kept strictly confidential
in this business
youre out of your head
how can you take on a job like this
amazing what you can do
with a garlic sausage
it an open-and-shut case
there absolutely nothing to it
anyway it a cucumber isnt it
nothing to it
you dont know the first thing
about being a private detective
it definitely a sausage
ive seen the way blake does it
it dead easy
it just plain common sense
nothing more
ill get these
it all right bob ill get them
anyway ive got ambition havent i
if i hadnt id probably still be stuck
in that boring old insurance office
might be all right for you
derek but me
im going places
i still say youre trying to run
before you can walk like you always do
that bicycle pump must have been painful
anyway what about her thinking
youre blake that is fraud
yeah well ill tell her afterwards
when it all over

just admiring the decorations
lovely place youve got here
i foresaw a death in my tea leaves
someone is about to die i can sense it
what are you doing here
oh im sorry

and disappearing all over the place
you know i suspect there a secret panel
here somewhere

but dont worry as soon as
i find some ill know who it is
look um
i was thinking you know
later on tonight
i dont suppose you fancy a quick one
i mean if youre nervous about
sleeping alone
i dont mind
it all right i always lock my door
you always lock your door very wise
good night judd
if i were you id lock yours too
can i help you sir

oh
can i help you sir
that
that big bird it very interesting
the grimsdyke vulture sir
yeah yeah
who the fellow in the chain mail
marmaduke grimsdyke
we dont talk about him sir
i dont know why you made me come
all the way out here
why couldnt you come to the hotel
are you just going to stand there
or are you going to give it to me
hello there
hello percy been a good boy then
what happened
it was an accident
i fell on top of him he out cold
have you got any smelling salts
who is it
oh it scott whatever he doing here
he not breathing
oh my god ive killed him
he been shot
it was an accident
i fell on top of him i
he been what
look
look the thing to do is
to keep perfectly calm and not panic
so dont panic dont panic
let go and get the police
ill phone the police
and then well go and get the police
no no no no wait
will you wait
what
obviously it isnt an accident
you mean he been murdered
yes
oh my god listen
what do you phone for the police
christ it on the tip of my tongue
what is it
i mean
just wait will you just wait
you dont understand he been murdered
i know but if you stop rushing into
things and let me think clearly
think clearly yes that very good
think clearly
999 that what it is
i knew it was something
before you do anything
just sit down and let me think
look if he was shot outside
wed have heard it right
right
right
therefore he must have crawled there
or been placed there by somebody
for what possible reason
dont you see
no
to incriminate me
that exactly the kind of scandal
that everybody was waiting for
well have to hide him
what
will you shut up
if we can just delay him being found
for a few days
until the estate is mine
after that it doesnt matter
you cant do that
oh judd darling
that is the answer
what about the police
i mean you cant just go around
hiding dead bodies
you know there a law against
that sort of thing
nobody will ever know
there a quarry not far from here
he wouldnt be found for days
no im sorry laura
absolutely definitely emphatically no
but what were really doing is
helping the police
are we
well scott wasnt murdered here
he was murdered somewhere else
so by us moving the body we are stopping
the police from being confused
i dont think they will see it
quite like that somehow
especially if they find out
good evening craddock
good night madam
as soon as it light
you can get rid of it properly
what do you mean as soon as it light
well it going to look suspicious
if you try and get rid of it
in the middle of the night
oh judd you dont know
what this means to me
about
about 0 years i should think
if they find out
come on
morning sir
morning
i shouldnt think you can see much behind
with that on the back
well i saw you
it contrary to the motor vehicles
construction and use regulations
section 40 sub-paragraph 5
road traffic act 972
yeah well im sorry officer
i didnt realize
that i was contravening
where your spare wheel
well it in the back i suppose why
youre gonna need it
youve got a flat tire
right sir if youd care to get
out of the car ill give you a hand
it shouldnt take long
that all right officer
actually i can manage on my own
it going to be okay
in spite of what the public thinks
we do like to help sometimes
now youre gonna need a hand with this
otherwise youll never get the wheel out
right if youd like
to take the other end
ready one two three

well im easy
i thought you might be
youve got that look about you
i knew youd be just game for anything
the moment i saw you out there
no no i didnt mean that
does it do things for you
i see all the sex films you know
hot lust and sweaty thighs
nuns in rubber
now look i mean i didnt
i just i thought that
well ordinary sex
gets so boring doesnt it
especially with frederick
he my husband
he got no imagination
not like the milkman
youd be amazed what he gets up to
with his extra pint of
then it into the high heel boots
and gestapo uniform
for a quick bit of the night porter
with the gasman
how about a bit of last tango in paris
ive got loads of butter in the fridge

but i tried it with the window cleaner
last week and nearly choked myself
look love i only came in here
to get me hands washed
oh i love it when they play hard to get
leave it out

it was an accident
how could you
i just turned my back for a second
that all and then it was gone
i was washing my hands
washing your hands
look i had to change the wheel didnt i
and then this woman came out
but that was after
the policeman pulled me up
well he didnt exactly pull me up
but he wanted to change the wheel
i had to help him otherwise it would
have looked suspicious wouldnt it
i had to and i did
and then this funny woman came out
with kinky black leather boots whip
the trunk where is it
oh no what are you two doing down here
why what have you done now
i dont believe it
i just do not believe it
even you couldnt be that stupid
all right ill admit there been
a slight error of judgment on my part
error do you realize
what youve got yourself into
following somebody about with binoculars
is one thing but murder
youve really landed
yourself in it this time
it no good you keep going on about it
i mean i didnt murder him did i
ill admit that things havent gone
quite as id liked them to
there no talking to him
i give up i just give up
oh im sure he was only trying to help
i told you not to take this case
in the first place
but you wouldnt listen to me
but ive solved it
i mean i know who murdered him
it just a question of proving it
that all
what do you mean
you know who murdered him
i do his accomplice
then why havent you told the police
well because im not quite sure
exactly who the accomplice is yet
but ive got some suspects
suspects
you wait until you see how strange
the butler been acting lately
what does that miss sutton
have to say about it
well she reckons the best thing to do now
is just to try and solve
the case as quickly as possible
listen that trunk has probably
been opened already
and if it has it will be no time at all
before it traced back to this place
so you go to the police before they come
to you and you tell them everything
i cant do that i promised laura
it the only chance youve got
of getting yourself out of this mess
short of pleading insanity on second
thought that probably your best chance
look if i tell the whole story
laura will inherit nothing
well so what
it better than being an accessory and
going to prison for the rest of your life
he right you know
is the plumber there
no no im sorry he hasnt been here
do send him round
yes ill tell him as soon as he comes
goodbye maam
the inspector please
oh yes youve come to the wrong place
he not here
pardon
no i just had his wife on the phone
wondered what happened to you
what happened to me
yes she expects you
really
yes youll find his house number 6
on the right the one with the red door
well what are you waiting for
the one with the red door
the one with the red door
thank goodness youre here
i was getting quite desperate
do come in
thank you
the kitchen at the back
i tried to do it myself
but it wasnt really very satisfactory
what i really needed was a nice long tool
to poke it with properly
if you see what i mean
i hunted about for hours
but i couldnt find anything satisfactory
finally i decided the only thing to do
is to get a man round instead
yes well actually ive come to
solve my little problem yes i know
i do hope youve got
the right equipment for it
it probably just tea leaves
oh no no
youve got it wrong im not
quite sure what it is
i do understand mr
west
you see well everyone thinks it blake
how strange blake doesnt sound
a bit like west
i suppose youll probably try
to suck it out with your little plunger
drink
say when
when
what
when
my goodness
you certainly like your drink dont you
i like a man who not afraid to admit it
listen when i came round
i thought your husband
was going to be here
oh he wont be home for ages yet
why dont you come and sit down
cheers
cheers
is it getting hard
pardon
finding work
oh yeah well
look are you sure about your husband
positive
he is the inspector
yes
and he a very difficult man
to live with i can tell you
oh really
i dont want you to get the wrong idea
but i get the kind of feeling that youre
the sort of man i could really depend on
but
what about the husband
oh he wont be back for ages yet
plenty of time
mummy

because ive got
a few more appointments
then the real plumber came in and it
somebody just put this
underneath my bedroom door
the burlesque club
table five 000 sharp
bring the money in used notes
yes well that where he made
his final mistake isnt it
what final mistake
well i give him the money he hands over
the negatives and then i nab him

ill just wait for him to expose himself
and then ill pinch him
well as long as
he doesnt get sidetracked
like some people we could mention
all i want to know is
where am i going to get 50000 from
dont you worry love
i know exactly how these things are done
do you really think
that going to work
never fails

at the top and it all looks real
i wonder who it going to turn out to be
the butler
that who did it the butler
how do you work that one out
call it a hunch if you like
call it a wild guess
youll see
look i didnt like to
voice my suspicions beforehand
but tonight after he turns up at that
club ill have all the proof i need
youd better otherwise im in trouble
dont worry
itll be the butler he the blackmailer
he also a murderer

hey
hi
hello
uh sara hamilton
yeah thatd be me
yeah
well this package
is for you
finally
i almost gave up waiting for it
well it all yours
if i can just get you
to sign right there
youre a godsend
if you hadnt turned up today
it would have been too late
i knew that
why do you think im here now
there you go
thank you and enjoy
thank you
whatever was so important
i will thank you
thank you
humanity has had
the oddest habit
of turning a blind eye
to anything
that makes it uneasy
in 634 galileo was declared
a heretic for daring to suggest
that it was in fact the earth
that revolved around the sun
and not the other way round
and even though
this was one of the most
strongly supported facts
ever disclosed
that assertion cost him
not only his reputation
but it also cut him off
from society
right up until the day he died
for centuries
thousands upon thousands
of people
have experienced ufo sightings
and various forms of encounters
with extraterrestrials
even over 3000 years ago
the mayans depicted
some of these occurrences
in their wall carvings
but of course
it wasnt until
the advent of photography
towards the end
of the 9th century
that we were able
to actually record proof
physical proof
of these sightings
but that was never
gonna be enough
what with our ingrained
mockery and dupery
which gave way
to incessant suspicion
and dogma
which of course cast such
an enormous shadow of doubt
all over this proof
at least for those
who chose to turn
hello
a blind eye
hi sara
it just your mom calling
hi mom
how are you
im fine
listen the reason
im calling is
i wondered if you may be free
to come over for lunch tomorrow
oh are you serious
you know i cant
im going away you know that
sorry love
yes you did tell me
i dont know why i was certain
that was next week
oh no mom it this weekend
couldnt
someone else from the office
at least go with you
to keep you company
mom can we not do this again
you know this not work-related
this is for my book
i know sara
mom
are you hearing yourself
were not in the 20s
anymore okay
women can travel
around the world by themselves
you really need
to accept that already
you watch
your tone young lady
this is your mother
youre talking to
and you make it sound
like i was around
when dinosaurs ruled the earth
you are so like your father
mom please tell me
youre not drinking again
course not
anyway
i wasnt gonna bring this up
but i was speaking to your aunt
and she said she read
all kinds of weird stories
about that place
youre so intent on visiting
oh mom please
well you do
whatever you think you should
i can least expect
a call from you
as soon as you get there
though right
no mom
there no signal in the forest
and im pretty sure
there no wi-fi either
okay
you know what
ill ill call you
as soon as i get home
on monday okay
all right okay
but please promise me
youll be careful with the car
oh yes mom
okay ill talk to you soon
all right bye i love you
look
and four living creatures
emerged from the center
of the image
when the creatures moved
the wheels rolled
along with them
and when the creatures floated
above the land
the wheels also floated
because the spirit
of those creatures
was in the wheels
ezekiel chapter one
so as the prophet predicted
humanity found itself facing
one of its greatest challenges
to date
having to acknowledge
the existence of civilization
from other parts of the galaxy
we can only hope that this time
unlike what happened
with galileo
we wont have to wait
all of 300 years
to authenticate the veracity
of the unmitigated proof
we will be providing today
that must be it
excuse me
um um im headed
to the military barracks
is this the right way
youd think god
might at least do something
about our appearance
and that damn foul smell
when our souls
finally abandon us right
it definitely not one
of his stronger points
twenty years on the force
and the smell doesnt get
any kinder on the senses
i dont know
how you do put up with it
no different
to a deer or a boar
you say so
i just about
had enough of it joe
this has got to be the only
nature reserve in the world
where the damn bears
choose not to hibernate
what can i say
the unpredictable mysteries
of nature
yeah well a fucking truce
over the winter
would be doing everyone
a favor now wouldnt it
sure but like i already said
the temperature affects
their behavior
and besides
people know all well and good
the danger
theyre putting themselves in
by coming out here
there are warning signs
at every entrance
not to mention
the permit you need
before youre even allowed
to step foot in this place
yeah fucking waste of time
if you ask me
i dont why you all get off
on that red tape bullshit
well
looks like youve got your work
cut out for you
youd best get on with it
yeah i best had
um
youll have to excuse me
call me or come find me
whenever you want
mi casa su casa
and all of that
yeah right
moron how many times
ive got to tell you
no taking photos around me
get the fuck outta here now
it okay boss it okay
jesus christ
oh my god
oh my god
youre joe right
uh yeah
you must be the journalist
yeah something tells me
you knew that
before you scared
the hell out of me ranger
sara hamilton
yup thatd be me
good
well it great to see
youve brought your permit
and turned up on time
i wish everyone else
would take a leaf
out of your book
yeah well
i had no other choice
some guy on the phone
gave me strict instructions
otherwise there was no way
i was getting in here
yeah
uh that guy on the phone
might have been me
well you cant be too careful
you know
uh sometimes people
are too smart
for their own good
and they only realize
once it too late
yeah i got you
we need to know
when people are gonna be here
so we can be around
to keep watch over you
contrary to what
most people believe
the biggest obstacle
isnt getting in here
it getting out
alive
yeah the bears
exactly
yeah i saw the commotion
on the river bank
well i hope
the man upstairs
doesnt give us any problems
i think well be okay
but were gonna start
inside so
you dont have anything
to worry about
great
what do you say
we do this already
ill follow you
so what do you think
of this so far
it amazing
cant wait to get inside
something tells me youre not
gonna be disappointed
humans need something
to hold onto you know
and when it something
you cant
quite get your head round
you take your own ignorance
as the truth
well that a lovely
philosophy joe
but there must have been
documented cases
of sightings and contact
before what happened
well sure
but there no actual proof
of anything
from the moment
the barracks were built
until they were abandoned
official records you mean
well yeah
i couldnt tell you
about anything off the record
although i guess
i gotta warn you
strange things still happen here
now and again
shit
what going on
okay just keep quiet
what
oh my god
okay sara just do exactly
as i say
okay
okay
now on three
i want you to run out
of the forest as fast as you can
towards the barracks
as if your life depended on it
wait what about you
no dont ask questions now
for god sake sara
okay just run
and no matter what you hear
dont look back you hear me
no looking back
okay okay
one
two
three run sara run
fuck fuck fuck
help
help
come on
come out here
you dont get the balls do you
couldnt you have picked
a better time
cant you see weve got guests
come on come out here
where the hell are you
you still havent learned
who makes the fucking rules
around here have you
oh god oh god
shit
oh my god
youre a
fucking savage bastard
joe joe
joe watch out watch out
whoa whoa whoa
jesus what the fuck
jesus ed
what
you know him
yeah of course i do
everybody does it ed
didnt i mention him earlier
no no you didnt
oh well he as weird
as they come but
his heart is in the right place
isnt it buddy
jesus joe
yeah
i caught it on the iron rails
on the fence
we need to get you
to a hospital
it nothing
what
yeah all right
whatever you say
where he going
uh he got
a first aid kit in his hut
he gonna stitch it up for me
come on
youre joking right
no
it not the first time either
these sort of things happen
all the time
come on
he lives down there
no of course not
he lives in a caravan
in the forest
on the other side
of the barracks
but if we go this way
we avoid having to deal
with that friend
of ours outside again
yeah
and were just gonna
go down there just like that
come on
itll be more fun this way
yeah
you could say ed
the real keeper of this castle
he scares prying eyes away
even the damn bears
are scared of him
but what is he
mute or something
uh not exactly
he just
not the most talkative
of people
but he quite the erudite
youll see
here where
the officer rooms were
and at the far end
command and captaincy offices
and why was there a nursery
oh
some of the higher officers
lived here with their families
there were stories
about how women became
more fertile in this forest
it was a pretty productive time
for some of them
yeah
come on
youre gonna like this
ah leave it out
will you
let me show her
come on
what his problem now
ah nothing
he just
over meticulous is all
see
this was how they got
to the higher floors
up there was the library
the living room
and the bedrooms
for the noncommissioned
officers
and down there
hell
that actually
wouldnt surprise me
yeah well
the gateway at least
dr marshall
molecular biology lab
and the weapons tunnel
were on the lower floors
and
if you stick your head in there
for a few seconds
you can still hear the screams
of the long-lost souls
who were trapped down there
youre making fun of me
arent you
you be the judge
oh my god joe
what the hell is that
i told you weird things
still happen around here
dude what really down there
cause if youre not making
this up im leaving right now
yeah right were coming
keep your hat on
he wants us to get a move on
but pay no attention
well true or not
it probably not the best idea
to be walking around here
on your own
but i will put you
out of your misery
and i will tell you what it is
yeah something
that makes sense please
im serious
and by the way
do you really understand
everything that he says
um
how do i explain this
let me break it down
have you ever had a dog
yeah when i was a kid
chewie
he was part
of the family
okay
and even though chewie
all he ever did was bark
you still understood
everything he said right
yeah
exactly
well imagine if youve had
a chance to share
a couple of beers with him
im sure
your canine communication skills
would have reached
all new levels
well i never thought
about it like that
that what i was trying
to say earlier
more often than not
the truth is actually a lot
less complicated than it seems
you see
that what i was
getting at earlier
when we talked
about all those rumors
that were flying around
yeah and
what about those cries
we just heard
exactly
what about those cries
that just the sound
of the north wind blowing
through the ventilation ducts
on the lower levels
well that scared
the shit out of me
imagination can be
a man worst friend
isnt that right ed
time to visit
the underworld then
uh not yet
this is an exit
that leads directly outside
the tetis region
was one of the hot spots
where various ufo activity
was witnessed
following the cosmic call
as a result of the power burst
caused by the hiroshima
and nagasaki bombs
one of the most bizarre
ufo occurrences ever recorded
took place right here
on october 5th 946
a manned alien ship crashed
in the rocky mountain range
you can see behind me
the military swiftly moved in
a 25-kilometer radius
extending from the crash site
was declared
off-limits to civilians
it was impossible to gain access
to this forest
for the four decades
that the now abandoned
military reserve was operating
but on that october evening
before the military even arrived
on the scene
a local witnessed the event
and he took a photograph
that photograph
was published in the media
which caused
the government to launch
a relentless campaign rejecting
and debunking the proof
now in the photograph
taken by the civilian
we can see the image
of the flying saucer
and two human-shaped figures
lying on the ground
whose body measurements
deviate considerably
from the human norm
the official version
attributed the event
to a military jet
which crashed during training
caused by rotational energy
accordingly society mourned
the death of these two pilots
whose charred cadavers
were said to have been retrieved
near the fuselage
hmm
so what became
of this third figure
when they wake up
after the winter lethargy
they have one hell
of an appetite
and are seriously
sexually active
it their mating season
so they turn aggressive
because of how few
females there are
and why are there
so few females
i guess well have to ask
the man upstairs
the thing is they think
theyre the fucking kings
of the jungle you know
no respect for us humans
sara
come over to me it okay
come over here
ed
your friend back
okay okay
follow ed okay
it gonna be okay i swear
okay
go sara go
you heard the boss complaining
didnt you you bastard

oh my

ed i know what youre like
and youll both get hurt
hey

well at least i hope not
he gonna teach it a lesson
in his own particular way
shouldnt you go with him
well
oh no hurry
do you want me
to help you with
mmm no
it okay thanks
um i can probably do
a brushing up
of my sewing skills
after last time
joe can i take a look
yeah yeah of course
while the cat away
i mean ed doesnt really like
people meddling with his stuff
you said dr marshal
was in charge of the lab right
yep he was
and
he was ed dad
he was what now
yeah you heard me
ed was born and bred
in these here woods
he oblivious to the world
outside the forest
hence his
kindred relationship
with the wildlife
everyone just assumed
he disappeared
in the explosion that
killed his parents
and destroyed
the military barracks
but he was hiding in the woods
and grew up
living like a caveman
but what about his family
didnt he have
uncles or grandparents
someone
yeah
i guess there mustve
been someone
but this was
the only world he knew
that the embroidery done
yeah
i guess he just
didnt wanna leave
his memories behind you know
and he probably felt
it was his responsibility
to carry on his dad work
can i take a look
youre a reporter
with a scientific bent too
yeah of course
no secrets here
at least until
ed gets back anyway
uh
stay here and dont worry

of the military base
although im sure youre
probably asking yourselves
what happened
to that sole alien survivor
with not a shred
of physical proof
suggesting the fact
that it even existed
maybe it was simply
just destroyed
in the explosion
that killed the doctor
and virtually
every one of the soldiers
housed at the barracks
fucking psychopath

on the afternoon
of april 30th 946

is this called love
will it give so much pain
should i just cry that you are not here
my tears are floating like a river
will i be able to see you in my dreams
i am waiting for you to call me
as you are not coming back i feel lost
there is no life without you
who said there is no love
i am standing here today
like a bird with no wings
should i just tell you my feelings
behind my silence
i will be standing on a curved road
all alone
do you know that these are written
with tears in my eyes
this pain in my heart is hurting me
so much
should i shout that i am nothing
without you in my life
i am alone just like a star
with no light
did you find ram
i thought you would ask me
why am i here as soon as you wake up
where is ram
do you know what is your condition
youve been lying here
since 2 days without food
it is good that we came here on time
where is ram
are you mad
he is not here nobody knows
where he is
everyone is searching for him
where did he go
when can he come back
amrutha…
if youre love is true
he will come back
if you stop eating like this you will die
before he is here
you know what is more painful
than death
loving someone wholeheartedly
amrutha think before you do something
we all know how much you love ram
he might have done that because
he was angry
phone ringing
amrutha ram is at shepherd court
ram why did you do this ram
why did you leave me
you know i cannot live without you
leave me
please ram i know it is my fault
please forgive me
i will not repeat this ever again baby
please i cannot stay without you
i cannot live without you i cant
amrutha leave me it doesnt look good
let them see i dont care
why are you behaving like a psycho
i will really become mad
if you leave me ram
be however you want
i will not question again
you need not work also
i will take care of everything
don’t do anything just be with me
that enough
you mean that im still a useless man right
i didnt say that ram
you will look after me
i didnt mean it in that way
then why did you say that
i said that because i love you
yeah that same love made me
stand on this road
there is no freedom
you must like all that i do
you change everything as per your wish
understanding each other feelings is what love is
you shouldnt force people into anything
ive been observing ever
since we met each other
you keep poking into everything
and call it love
i cannot do this anymore
please leave me
hey
ram please dont say that
i will not repeat this ram
ill stay however you want
i will whatever you want me to do
i will prove that my love is true
please give me one last time ram
will you really prove it
yeah i will
then dont show me your face again
and then i will trust your love
just leave
is this your final decision
yes
what happened
where are you going amrutha
i am going back to india
why what happened
will you really prove your love
yeah i will
then dont show me your face again
just leave
amrutha you going india in
this condition is not good
i cannot stay here brother
if i stay back i cannot stop myself
from meeting ram
i cannot face all that
will you spoil your life for that
a person should never take a decision
when they are angry sad or happy
as you both have been together
for so many days
he might have got irritated a bit
but love will be the same
if you want to win his love
you should first lose
stay away from ram for few days
things will settle
trust me amrutha time heals everything
what is this buddy
why are you doing this
what did i do
dont ask me that
how many days will you stay away
from everyone
i think ill be peaceful staying away
from people for few days
you mean you were not peaceful
all these days
i didnt mean it that way
we all know how much she loves you
why are you not understanding that
if you are here only to talk
about amrutha please leave
what you want me to leave
before i leave ill talk
everything clearly
first tell me something
what is amrutha mistake
mistake it is a very small word
she cheated on me
cheating
loving you so much is cheating
thinking about you always
is called cheating
leaving everything behind
for you is called cheating
she wanted to live with you
die with you is all this cheating
she cared for you more than your parents
if she really cared about me so much
why didnt she inform me
about the job
she clearly knows you would never agree to it
if this is called cheating
then what you are doing with her now
is called betrayal
is this called betrayal
is that called betrayal then
you got that job because
you attended the interview
because of your talent and
not because she recommended
okay let us keep that aside
she made a fool out of me by paying back
to jd isnt that a mistake
are they any great people for you
to become a fool
she gave money back to jd and
asked him not to irritate you anymore
she didnt make a fool out of you
but instead saved your dignity
and coming to that abhay
we both know about his character
since the day amrutha came here
she only had you in her priority list
it is your luck that you have her
in your life
girls are horrible these days
and youve got her in your life
please stop it
you are just talking about
amrutha continuously
not just her even i loved her
wholeheartedly
my love is genuine too
then why cant you forgive her
she wanted her love to win so she did this mistake
why cant you forgive and move on
why should i compromise
why cant she do it
she was doing the same till now
whatever the situation is
she was the one who always compromised
sorry i am really sorry
it was my mistake
sorry sorry i am sorry
it was my mistake
please forgive me
if you want the relation to be strong
you should also know to forgive people
amrutha is a girl who only
knows to give love
the day you understand this
you will go back to her
this is not my philosophy
it is nature philosophy
it is your wish now
you made my imagination come true with your love
our souls have become one
everything was so good when i was with you
im the one who left you
it is my mistake
not having you in my life is giving me pain
and im unable to bear it
it is all you everywhere
when i close or open my eyes
my world is empty without you
ive realised there is no life
without you
utham
where is amrutha i want to see her
harrison street landsdale
melbourne
phone ringing
hello
hello amrutha
hi brother how are you
im fine but guess what
ram is coming for you
yeah amrutha he has totally changed
what
he wants to see you
he is coming in search of you
i told you know
time heals everything amrutha
thank you brother
ambulance
yes yes sir
his condition is critical
the major complication and death
may be imminent
he has got multiple fractures in his body
mainly his heart is damaged
it called cardiac tamponade
his heartbeat count will be decreased
to 20 times per minute from 70-80
it is very tough for him to survive
maximum 24 hours
talk to the indian embassy
finish the formalities and
plan how to take the body to india
we are helpless sorry
where is amrutha
im talking to you where is amrutha
she is not here
where did she go
she has gone to india
i know she will not leave me
in this condition and go
tell me where she is
tell me the truth
im not lying
i can see it in your eyes utham
what youre saying is lie
how many days can i hide the truth
you must know it someday or the other
what truth
where is amrutha
hello brother
doctor this is a developed country
well developed science
with advanced medical treatment
cant we treat a person who is
still alive with all these equipments
there is one small chance
but i dont think itll work
we can replace his heart
with someone who is brain dead
or someone who met with
an unexpected accident
there is a chance for him to live
if we replace his heart with them
but we dont have a chance now
as it should be done in the next 24 hours
finding a heart with the same blood group
immediately is impossible
so you better take him home
doctor can i see him
sure
ram
this doctor is talking all nonsense
he says your heartbeat isnt normal
but your heart will be fine and i know it
love can solve any problem in this world
if your heartbeat stops my love will have no meaning
you will be fine ram
you will be fine
i always thought love is all about you being
how i like and me being how you like
but i understood it isnt like that
love is all about being happy together
i thought pure love is only
about giving life
but no it is about loving someone truly
i still remember how my heart raced
when i first saw you
it is love at first heart for me
love is two words and mad is two words
i love you madly
and i can end my life for you
people kill themselves
and make their love win
youve given me place in your heart but today
if that heart stops beating
how will my heart work
the minute your heart stops beating
mine will stop too
so ive decided to become your heart
i feel lucky for doing this as no girlfriend
will ever get this opportunity in her life
not just happiness
but sacrifices are also a part of love
ive decided to do this to prove
that god cant tear us apart
hello
hello
royal city hospital
yes
i got an information that you guys are
looking for heart transplantation
yeah
someone just met with an accident
at mantrait caston way
can you please send an ambulance
as soon as possible
sure
thank you
people generally fear death
but i am loving it today
it time for me to end my life
and save my love
you left me proving that
love never ends
this merciless death took you
away from me
ram please dont cry
if you cry you know that
ill feel bad
we are not two different people
we are one now
i will be with you in every
aspect of your life
no one can ever take me away from you
i am your heartbeat every second now
your problems your happiness
everything has become mine
this is something no girl
can ever experience
lovers can never come into this world
together or leave together
but for us we both got a second chance
we will live together die together
ive made you all mine from today
you gave me a chance to prove my love
you made me a part of you
and gave my life a better meaning
i love you so much ram
did the earth just crack open
did the cruel life steal you from me
did the compassionate gods forget me
my love wont you return
i feel empty without you
no matter how long
i would still wait for you

to his majesty

how did i get picked
to be king actually
it written in
the sacred scrolls
that our king once
banished will return
the one who walks as a man who
walks into our village is king

the village could be king
only the chosen one
oh right

ok so what your name
im called roxy
roxy
roxy i like that
so what do you do here roxy
ive been waiting
for your arrival
really
that it
ive been trained
by the holy sisters
my entire life to serve
the king once he returns
wow it must have been
pretty boring waiting for me
the anticipation
it been terrible
ill bet
ill bet
so what did these
sisters teach you anyway
hello
anybody
i have rights you know
the intergalactic alliance
planetary conference clearly
states that no traveler
traveling with an alliance base
shall be imprisoned
against his will

language
what is this
i am prefect alexa
the ruler of this sect
and you were caught
trespassing in our territory
there are no men allowed
why do you think i came here
there are clear
warning beacons
the galactic
alliance has honored
our desire to stay isolated
i didnt think a little
visit would be so bad
is that right
what is that
a mob of anxious women
outside this building
theyve heard of your
arrival and would like
to see a man for themselves
really
well bring them on
im anxious to meet them
you see cody
i cant let that happen
leave us
your presence here is causing
quite a bit of a problem
then send me back
it not that simple
if i do that the problem
will still linger
and what problem
would that be
men are a disease
they infect us distract
us and generally
lower the standard of living
correct me if im
wrong but without men
there wouldnt be any women

successful breeding programs

place to start as any
so you want to be a hostess
but no matter what happens
im still in control
well

incredible woman and they
turned to putty

space circling throughout time
a never ending chase a
search for the supply
catch a fleeting glance
split second and it gone
for one chance
obsession for
on and on
oh im going to find it
on and on
across the milky way
on and on
like a thousand light years
on and on
throughout time and space
time and space time and space
time and space time and space
relief is overdue
i think im gonna crash
simulation ending
a stimulation past
on and on
oh im trying to find it
on and on
across the milky way
on and on
like a thousand light years
on and on
throughout time and
space time and space

the new doctor

anna i havent treated
any patients in half a year
ricky death
was not your fault
i dont know that
maybe it was something i did
or didnt do
you want to look
for blame
well then
why dont you start
with the driver
of the truck
he was the one
who didnt like
the song on his radio
so he took his eyes
off the road
so he could
change the station
or how about the owner
of the minimart
where he got
his coffee that morning
maybe
he watered it down
or what about me
i was the one
that wouldnt let ricky
out of the house
until he double knotted
his laces
that took
20 seconds jack
20 seconds he could have used
to get across the road
there are people
who are hurt right now
who might die
if you dont walk back
into the er and help them
tyler is one of them
who do you think
ricky would want
treating his best friend
what is going on here
i told you to prep
warm saline dressing
and start an iv line
maam im sorry
but family waits out front
and let get some meds
on board
and why didnt anyone tell me
this man not responding
to the atropine

through the service entrance
the building was hit
really hard anna
there a lot of people
trapped
can we get them out
were going to do
our best
here anna
put this on
this way anna
weve got leaks
in the gas main
when pockets of gas build up
anything can set them off
a spark static electricity
even a cell phone
is gas building up
in the cafe
i dont know
were going to put
a sniffer down who can reach
there a door
around the corner
at the end of the hall
it leads to the back stairs
down to the cafe
if we can clear a path
we should be able to reach them
emily down there isnt she
well do everything we can
i give you my word
got a reading
off the sniffer yet
down this way
here where
the stairs would be
but the upper floors collapsed
my god
carl anna
gas is seeping in
were going to have to
dig them out
we cant risk it
we cant
if we throw off one spark
and the whole place blows
and you know
what happens
to those people
when the oxygen
gets displaced
at 20% gas
they get dizzy
at 40% theyll vomit
at 60%
they are dead
can we shut off the flow
to the neighborhood
all the shut-off valves
are underground
i wouldnt know
where to look
who would
public works
i dont understand
why cant you do
the surgery here
because
were not surgeons
this isnt a trauma center
youve been saying that
all afternoon
we dont have an or
or an anesthesiologist
then you bring
those people here
we cant
the roads are closed
there is no access
look we are still hoping
for a helicopter
and where is it
doug
anna working on it
right now
excuse me
i have
another patient
jack
ill be right there
be honest with me
without surgery
she only has a couple of hours
so youre saying
that if i have
something to say to her
i need to say it now
miriam
douglas
can we help you chief
can i talk to you
for a minute
miriam is injured
this is not a good time
weve got a big problem
there a gas leak in town
well im sure
the fire department
can figure out
how to shut off a valve
it a main valve
that leaking
douglas
im not on duty
im afraid youre going
to have to be
people lives are at stake
would you step outside
please sheriff
i will not leave my wife
you dont have
a choice
put him in the van
dont touch me
dont take another step
clint
anna let me
handle this
he refusing
to safeguard the public
in a crisis
you activated
the security plan
you ought to know
its provisions
stop
clint i want you to leave
the hospital
i want to talk
to douglas alone
i will handle this
it doesnt
look good anna
if we dont get her
off this mountain
i know
ive got marty and jason
working on a medivac
douglas i am so sorry
about the timing of this
but i need you
to come to the cafe
and turn off the gas
you cant ask me
to leave my wife
to go help people
who wouldnt help me
im not asking you
to help them
there are other people
who are trapped down there
and theyre running
out of time
emily one of them
douglas
hey baby
im right here
im right here
douglas go
there are
six regulator stations
for the town
the one that handles this area
is right here
it chestnut street
now to shut this sector off
from inside the station
takes electricity
can we bring in a generator
no not with
unmapped leaks in the line
it just not safe
so i got to get down
to the manual shut-off valve
down in the sewer
once i cut the flow
well need to burn off
whatever gas
is left in the line
so any businesses
that are supplied
at 2 psi and above
they should turn
their gas on full
that the bakery
the diner and the lodge
what if we get everyone
in the area to burn off gas
that a good idea
we could get into that cafe
faster
let go
carl im in over
it going up too fast carl
how much longer
can they be down there
weve got about 0 minutes
carl can you hear me
yeah douglas douglas
do you copy

i got you i got you
im at 70%

if he creates one spark
he blows up the whole place
we broke 85

a lot of smoke
until he breathing
on his own again
and his oxygen levels come up
i cant be sure

on that camping trip
every day
he would pull out the book

i didnt know
what to do or say
to help you and anna

that your job okay
okay
this is
mayor anna davenport
talking to you
from our emergency
broadcast station
kcxn 60 radio
at 45 this afternoon
our town was hit
by a shower of small meteorites
less than an hour later
more rocks fell
the damage has been severe
but localized
both the power plant
has been hit
knocking out most of the
electricity in the county
weve got a broken water
main
and are being advised
to boil water
before drinking it
or just drink bottled water
until further notice
there have been some
casualties and many
injuries
dr ryan and dr baxter
are at the hospital
treating patients
but they need blood
every type and a lot of
it
so if you can
please come in and give
for those of you who cannot
stay in your homes
or dont want to be
alone
were setting up
a temporary shelter
at the cottonwood
community church
millie wildflower will be
coordinating efforts there
for those of you
who are afraid
that more rocks may fall
and are thinking about
getting out of town
well that
no longer possible
one of the impacts took out a
piece of highway 40
about six miles
down the mountain
even if you could
get off the mountain
it wouldnt keep you safe
there have been reports
of rocks falling
all over colorado
with an alert
for continued activity
in the sky
so what are we left to
do
where do we turn
when we cannot run
i hope to each other
dont wait to hear from
me
look in on your neighbor
share whatever food and water
you have
it comes from the bible
two are better than one
for if they fall
one will lift the other up
and a three-fold rope
is not easily broken
we are a town of 900
we are not easily broken either
seth
seth
there is one last thing
id like to say
seth
im the mayor of cottonwood
but im also a mother
emily wherever you are
please keep yourself safe
please sweetie be safe
my daughter emily
is missing
if anyone knows where she
is
please come to the hospital
and let us know
and em if you can hear me
i love you
and i will find you
all the way to the right
ease off the clutch
keep it going
that it
okay that it
im out
emily
emily emily
emily
seth
em
seth i did it
i got you out
god
no
my god
im so sorry
better
yes
how his blood gas
his c-o-2 is 49
and his p-h is 7-3-2
natalie can you resecure
his et tube
yes doctor
im thinking of upping
his vent rate
yeah i wouldnt
recommend that
why not
well he already had
a tension pneumo
a slightly low o-2 level
wont kill him
but if we blow out
his other lung
id leave his
airway pressure down
when i was at sc
i was working on a study
on permissive hypocapnia
in kids with chest trauma
there were many fewer
lung complications
why havent i
seen this study
it still underway
hasnt been published yet
look i know
it goes against your gut
it went against mine too
until i saw the early results
but it what tyler needs
how long have you been
out of residency doctor
three years why
you know when i said
a hundred years experience
can be a helpful number
three can be helpful too
let do it
thank you for coming
what are you
doing here
you asked the citizens
of this town to give blood
im here to give blood
im sorry
i shouldnt have had
my back up
around me

franny

she left work early
why where
was she going
she didnt say

they didnt say
she was with seth

why wouldnt they
have called
a cell doesnt get
reception up here

they would have tried
to get back to town
maybe they thought
it was safer up here
maybe they tried to get back
and they couldnt
theyve had an accident
or theyve been
struck by rocks
would you keep
those thoughts to yourself
why is it our kids
cant stand to be apart
and we cant stand
to be together
weve never even had
a civil conversation
what do you want to talk about
well did seth say anything
this morning
we had some words
not about emily
about his mother
i didnt know molly very well
we were always friendly
when we saw each other in town
i know
i never really understood
why she left
i know that too
she said
she didnt want
to live in a small town
the rest of her life
called it provincial
hopeless
she didnt think about her son
who had his friends here
or the husband with a job here
i dont begrudge her
her ambition
i just wish shed
told me before we had seth
so did emily say
anything to you
nothing
she wouldnt even speak to me
she so angry
because i want to move too
sometimes i wonder what kind

doctor weve got a problem
bed 4 coding
we need the crash cart
and a defibrilator now
find doug
keep him in the waiting room
im seeing cardiac arrest
i got nothing
start cpr
anna it tad
can you hear me
anna
mom
she not responding
anna i want you
to listen to me
the rocks that have been falling
over the last few hours
we now know that theyre debris
from a single larger meteor
heading our way
your way or mine
the computer models put impact
in eastern routt county
just north of highway 40
in other words mine
what going to happen
as it hits the atmosphere
youre going to hear
a tremendous sonic boom
louder than any youve heard
so far
the sky above you
will turn blindingly bright
and then
listen
im not gonna kid you anna
if it hits it like
an atomic bomb going off
total devastation
at impact site
with significant damage
up to 500 miles away
what do you mean if it hits
it theoretically
possible
that a big rock like this
could blow apart
from all the friction it causes
as it goes through
the atmosphere
if the composition
is just right
has that ever happened
once or at least
we think so
in 908 a big meteorite
about this size
was coming in over siberia
seconds before
it shouldve hit the ground
it just blew apart in the sky
how much time is there
projected impact
is in 45 minutes
you know we have
no road out of here tad
ive contacted general wade
at northcom
i put in a request for
as many choppers
as they can spare
a request
there are 900 people
in cottonwood anna
there are tens of thousands more
in towns all across the rockies
there just arent
enough helicopters
and there
not enough time
im sorry
do you believe in prayer tad
i believe in science
but sometimes i hedge my bets
well hedge one for us
will you
im so sorry
we did everything
we could but
would you like me
to take you in
anna
there another one coming
bigger than all the others
if it gets through
no one will survive
i cant do this
anymore
i cant fix it
i cant help the people
of this town
i
i cant even reassure them
that
what i thought
until you led me
back here
ill have no regrets
about today
because i know
i did everything that i could
and that because of you
there are certain things
that cant be put in a box
and made all better
ricky one of them
now miriam is
and what might happen
in that sky tonight is another
for the last six months youve
been turning away from me
away from emily
away from everybody else
in this town
you have 45 minutes anna
what are you going to do
with them
we can break in
in a moment anna
ill give you a cue
okay anna
youre on the air
this is mayor anna davenport
ive just spoken to
the colorado center
for emergency response
the latest report from nasa
shows a large meteor headed for
possible impact with earth
there is some hope that it
will explode in the
atmosphere
but if it doesnt
tracking has it making
landfall
somewhere between
the eastern rockies
and western colorado
the center of that radius is
right here in cottonwood
the estimated time of impact
is in 35 minutes
as your mayor it is my duty
to give you this
information
but there is no time
or means to flee
there is only time to
reflect
on how you want to spend
this next half hour
some of you may want
to spend it alone
others with your family
i want to spend it
with my husband
and my daughter
and the rest of my family
the people of this town
im going now
to the cottonwood
community church
i hope those of you
who want to
will join me there
i have to stay
i know
anna
do you remember
when ricky was four
and he learned
how to snap his fingers
he was so proud of himself
and he didnt just snap them
he flicked his wrist
like he was throwing dice
he made up a game about it
mad mommy he called it
i would have to pretend
to be mad at him
ricky youd better clean
up those toys right now
then hed snap his fingers
and id have to be nice
thank you for ricky
and thank you for emily
emily im really sorry
about this morning
it okay mom
i just wanted
so much to stay
to hold on
to this place
to ricky
and to seth
you really like him
dont you
yeah i do
i should have
listened to you more
i should have
talked to you more
what going
to happen tonight

to be together

going anywhere
im not going
to leave your side
you should go
go be with your family

what should we do now
where should we go
i think our odds of surviving
are better if we split up
if we all huddle here
and the church gets hit
who going to make it
out of here alive
if we fan out
as far as we can
well have a better
chance of survival
do you really want to survive
if the people you love dont

and i do believe
if we stand together
these moments will have meaning

around every turn

wow
ive always suspected
that i didnt want the desirable things
in life as much as i should
women cars houses movies bands
these things were how people chiseled out
a tidy philosophy of life
this cant be for real
it really serene
i never needed a philosophy of life
and one more thing
this is awesome
it only people who wanted things
felt guilty about getting
things and frustrated
about not getting things
that needed a philosophy
it might be my favorite
part of the house
the garage of cole dreams
a party shower and a sunroom
what will it all cost
i was just as pleased to get drunk
or drink a bunch and not get drunk
the main thing is the grass for me
there just so much of it
yeah
hmm

i dont know if it the same
one youre thinking of
curly headed
yeah that the one
and he alive
so far
pack your shit
did i just get promoted
yep
you goin to arkansas
im a drug dealer
im near the bottom rung of an outfit
run by a man named frog
a man ive never met before
to be honest
im not sure he even exists
what a lot of people dont know
about organized crime in the south
is that it not that organized
the term dixie mafia
has always been too generous
implied too grand a scale
there a handful of big-time operators
that run everything regionally but
it nothing like the italians
or the mexicans no families
just a loose affiliation
of deadbeats and scumbags
no code of honor
no philosophy of life
it mostly boring solitary work
but that suits me just fine
relying on other people
is the fastest way
fo end up dead in this business
you kyle
you swin
welcome aboard
ill be your co-pilot this evening
colin didnt mention id be
captaining a highway barge
yeah well youre moving wholesale now
the big leagues
what with the cones
i thought the randomness
of it might throw off a cop
well i guess that smart
im somethin of a criminal mastermind
oh youre one of those witty people
ive been called worse
you kinda remind me of a game show host
you know what kyle
it strikes me that if you wanna be
the strong silent type
you really gotta keep yourself
from commenting on every little thing
it wont be right away
but at some point soon
im gonna knock you on your ass
i suggest you keep
the bullshit to a minimum
look at you
no you act tough now
but well be friends
everybody who meets me
wants to be my friend
yeah i find that hard to believe
i mean what not to like
what kinda name is swin anyway
your mother
get in
if we go 83 the rest of the way
we wont be late
getting pulled over with drugs
makes you really late
there i go learnin again
you dont get this smart on accident
that nice to see
youre sad
no
it just most women
dont breastfeed anymore
which is a shame you know
cause breastfed babies
get fewer syndromes
i was a formula baby
your big ass im guessin had
a mouthful of the real deal
no idea
oh i bet ya did
bet you had a titty
in your mouth from day one
let call your mother and ask
she dead
i wouldnt care if all my sisters died
youre fuckin stupid
ah shit

uh first aid kit in the console
pat bright park ranger
you boys heading far
corpus christi
i noticed your rig needs some help
well not sure

if youre patient
you gotta get more rope
go corner to corner
yeah i know it
uh we were just in a rush this morning
still are what the haul
faucets
yep some
uh computer tycoon you know
used to be oil
now it computers
there are no faucets in corpus
that what i said
but he said he gotta have that
adobe-marble core
mm-hmm well let me take
a look how you got this stacked
im a safety expert in this state
i appreciate
i appreciate it sir
but the thing is
we really gotta haul ass
were already pretty far
hey enough questions
fuck
what the cones for
you boys are carrying a load of faucets
stuffed with bags of powder and plug
you left from little rock
and you got a map of each state
in your glove box
im with frog
ive been ordered to intervene
so you boys not gonna have
a lot of choice
about your immediate futures
you gonna work under me
at the state park
frog got a whole new loop of clients
and im running those deals
so try not to look like deer
in the headlights
try to look angry or bored or something
so you know frog personally
ive known frogman for years
ever since a truck of his
got lost in my park
you boys gonna ride with me
what about the flatbed
uh colin here will take it the rest away
what up kyle
i dont think you gonna need that
i about blew you away
you trying to convince someone

no i hate guns
they say it aint smart to fuck around
with someone you dont know
your name is kyle ribb
you never killed a man
and your name is swin horn
you never killed a man
youre dependable
youre a project
so here how this
is all gonna shake out
you two boys get to live
in trailers on the park grounds
dont worry im not playing favorites
theyre identical
youll have nine to five covers
as park peons
maintainin the grounds
directin lost suvs
you are here youre gonna make a right
and a left all the way to the end
your cover names are

and you may never quit
if you decide to run off
i will hunt you down
and i will kill you
no matter how much
ive grown to like you
do not socialize with the locals
do not bring girls around
do not draw attention to yourself
in time you two might take over
the operation
cutting me in for a humble percentage
why just think
one day this could all be yours
where the boss
vacuumin his corvette
goin on two hours
he obsessed with it
more of a german car guy myself
you think there any chance
bright is frog
ero

where do you think frog lives
on a ranch somewhere
i think that we will have
to work at this company
for a long time
before we ever found out
anything true about the frogman
i heard he has a pool
shaped like a lily pad
yep there you go
for a long time it just
gonna be shit like that
inconsequential falsehoods
sleep well
all nested in
would either of you boys
like to call me sir
you can if you want
i wont think it corny
were gonna go traffic drugs
across state lines sir
you see that
place like that where
my sisters are gonna end up
how many of those
you got anyway like ten
they dont have their real father
their stepdad is overly strict

who all lives here
our boss
we can use it
but not sleep in it
why
who else works at this park
see i knew this would happen
i knew youd become intrigued
of me and my glamorous lifestyle
we work for a private firm
that been hired
to evaluate the state park system
head ranger here was deemed unfit
so he got sent to an
indian reservation in oklahoma
were just stayin on to put things right
until he replaced
what exactly are you puttin right
mostly just
uh book keepin you know
but if the house is empty why
no cant use it
it a conflict of interest
i mean nobodyd really know if we did
we only come here for meals okay
in fact were about to leave
s0 we should probably just
you invite somebody else
no
mornin
uh dont be disturbed
im uh here lookin
for a patrick bright

ranger bright isnt available right now
maybe i should start over
okay
im barry

well my dad was a good friend
of ranger bright
guys started a tree service
together years ago
yeah so anyway
he passed away
so im drivin across
the country and visiting
all of his old pals you know
trying to
anyway uh he always said ranger bright
was one of the good guys so
here we are
he is indeed but unfortunately
he not here right now
were the junior rangers
im mollar that suarez
junior rangers
that what i said

hey
we need guns
a gun singular
for what
well we work over at the park
and we got our vacation coming up
we like to shoot targets to relax
but all we have is these shitty rifles
our boss said
we should try here for handguns
ranger bright said you should
try to get a gun from me
oh yeah he really respects you
said nothing mystifies you
hmm
shit hang on
it the seventh inning here
boys are down
freeman did and just like that
all righty
there one out
yeah we get that game going here
he tried to get a little
fancy there and it didnt work out
sorry about that
he really took that lead and
where were we
guns
that right
well i aint got no guns but uh
you can go to little rock
and get ya a gun
well we got a real problem
with city guns
we want somethin from out in the sticks
that someone dead daddy owned
what the plan for you two
you know in life
excuse me
well
it not too late to get on
a raft and float downstream
because bad things can happen to those
that dont pay the community fees
youre a little nutty
i love it
it fair to say that you traffic
in some underground goods
what the going rate
for a set of human bones
that ball swung on
there a high drive
into right center field and boy
this is gonna hurt us
depends on the person
you gonna sell us a gun or not
no i am not
because in your line of work
guns is as likely to get you killed
as it is to protect ya
and what line of work is that
rangering

yeah
okay

where swin

pot heads go to prison

they got or who rats you out
sometimes you can buy a way out
what is all this
are you all right
im pregnant
im pregnant

i could always make
somethin up and dump him
no no you cant do that
well you can if you want but
i think you should face

i try not to take it personally
am i gonna die
seven-fifty in cash
half a million in assets
this is what you call next level
we got buyin power now
we need to expand
well gang bangers are taking
more streets day by day
were gonna have to set up
some high-end exclusives
but what do you think frog
i think you can grow the business
any damn way you wanna grow the business
it your business now
you do what you want with it
i trust you
you feeling all right boss
maybe you took
too many hits to the head
the only mistake my mentor ever made
was not knowin when to step aside and
i dont want it to be like that with us
yeah it time i handed it over
you boys are ready
semi-retirement has a luxurious tone
to it dont you think
it does to me
ill find me a small place
out in the country
maybe over by bright park
ill open up a little curio shop
sleep late go to bed early
sell people shit
they dont need in between
we wanna have as much
good debt as possible
one day were gonna be
level six investors
right
like true capitalists
ill be like those
mob bosses in movies
sittin around in pizza joints
gettin fat
it a privilege i owe to you
you boys have made this possible
and unless there are people
stupid enough to provoke me
stupid enough to create
a threat to us or our business
be it through youth
or cockiness or ignorance
or whatever brand of idiocy
it would require
ill gladly lie dormant
in my little shell
while you two run the show
sorry about that
where were we
my actions dont seem
fo have any consequence
someone might still come to kill us
but it seems less likely
with each passing day
near as i can tell
bright death was my promotion
i guess as long
as his operation is runnin
frog dont care who runnin it
cornelius
beautiful
beautiful
like planet of the apes
oh yeah
id like to meet frog
it a good movie though
id like to know
what he thinks of me
as much for curiosity sake
as self-preservation
id like to look him in the eye
and see if it looks like a mirror
packets on hold
until i talk to ranger bright
what
what
oh
yall interrupting my exercise time
exercise
why would you be exercising
if you wanna die as soon as possible
i wonder what your rude friend
wants to do if i dont have a packet hmm
i intend to kill you by strangulation
now itll be suicide
cause im giving you a fuckin warning
why not just shoot me
all i brought are my big strong hands
what do you roll the ball
around in a circle 500 times
shut your ass up
is this an order from frog
frog said no more packets until he
finds out what happenin over here
that right
he wants to know what happened
to ranger bright
right and were probably supposed to
tell you so you can tell him
right
bull fuckin shit
are you the boss of this whole thing
dont be an idiot
wait a minute
are you the frogman
you have no intuition
intuition is for women
you dont need to worry
about intuition right now
what you need to worry about is the fact
that youre an unnecessary middleman
weve been thinking about streamlining
frog will be impressed if we can make
this operation more efficient
you are superfluous
what the fuck does that mean
you cant do that
you cant streamline
we do a whole bunch of shit
were not supposed to do
frog dont seem to mind
you dont understand
im a buffer
im a vital layer of insulation
mmm
im convinced you have a packet in here
and i refuse to tear the place up
now youre gonna hobble
right over and get it for me
how does one practice intuition
do you pray
mm-hmm
most prayers sound hollow in your head
but every once in a while one echoes
that the same as intuition
ill pray for you if you pray for me
the packet
it stuffed in the ball you asshole
what the fuck
why would you hide it from us
cause i was scared just like yall are
now i wanna know
what happened to ranger bright
he was my friend
your friend yes
you think that distributing
a manila envelope
every two weeks constitutes a friendship
to me and the ranger it did
oh
were not scared
you said were scared
same as you but that wrong
were not
consider that your baby shower
im sorry
youre right
sandra bullock is the happiest
she ever been
she views her divorce
and its fall out
as a blessing
and something she grew from
im sorry
but those magazines
are the canary and the coal mine
of western civilization
stop it theyre fun
it materialism run rampant
all that celebrity worship
and trash culture
it drivin everybody crazy
and they dont even realize it
keep talking professor
what do you think
all these zombie movies
and post-apocalyptic stories
are about the last few years
what
all these children novels
about over throwin
the government and fighting
each other to death
what are you talkin about
it mass projection
everybody wants the world to end
because if that what passing
for the american dream these days
they all wanna opt out
of what
of everything fuckin society
is that what you picture you did
opt out
touché
you wanna know the big reveal
hmm
you cant opt out
you cant i tried
i thought i had done it
but look at me
here i am
still ended up with a boss a job
and a wacky coworker
and a baby on the way
it a boy
is that a fact
it is
boy
yeah
id like to get the baby
some savings bonds for you know
save up for college
or clown school
or open a gun range
why wont you marry me
i dont not want to get married but
were still in the infatuation stage
even though were having a kid together
there no denying that were infatuated
that would be hard to deny
we should wait until after were not
attracted to each other anymore
to make a decision about marriage
it just doesnt make sense
what if that never happens
just give it time
colin was killed
cops busted into his shop and shot him
lookin for information about a car
and a dead kid they pulled
outta the swamp
ranger bright body
hasnt been found but
im pretty sure he been killed too
i sent barry over there to investigate
now he missing
they come here
and scare you half to death
then they stop by my shop
ask me if i wanted to
purchase a set of human bones
these two are supposed to be
workin for me
theyre about the worst enemies
ive ever had
i never had anybody kill my
associates or steal my money
whether they have a plan
or theyre just lost in a maze
of their own fuck ups
it dont matter now
theyre stupid
that what makes them dangerous
theyll be caught soon
and whatever happens
after theyve been caught
well
whatever wouldve happened
after theyve been caught
aint never gonna happen
youre gonna give em one last package
one last trip
somethin to make them
feel comfortable
make it close to hot springs
theyll feel lucky like uh
something goin right for em
nothing ever gonna go right
for them again
love you baby
sure you do
we shouldnt be here
gray cyprus kentucky
tell johnna gray cyprus
whatd you say
that your sisters
mm-hmm
dont be talkin in code
is he your brother or your husband
he funny
frisk em
theyre clean
get in the tub
you come on
let go get
let go
let go
let go move
oh you act tough now
but well be friends
everybody that meets me
wants to be my friend
we work for you dont we
so what were we supposed to do hmm
what would you have done if you were us
well
we both know you aint gotta do anything
to get in this spot
and i aint you
not by a long shot
nah youre a fat fuckin slob
what about the pawn shop guy
that doesnt sell anything
what do you think
i was starting to think he was frog
he was right there the whole time
so this outfit based in little rock
it aint based anywhere
why so secretive
youre planning to kill me right
oh it way passed the planning stages
first we need that cash
location of the bodies the girl
you should question swin
im not bothered by torture
well if i was gonna question swin
id have to hurry cause he
gonna be dead in a minute
and if you keep being such a pain
well well just go ahead
and shoot you in the head too
we dont need the money that bad
and we can find the girl on our own
the girl doesnt know shit
apparently not
hangin out with you two losers
if i was you
id go ahead and speed the plan up
keepin me alive is only
gonna end badly for you
dont embarrass yourself
trying to scare me
of course your brother
the only one allowed to have a gun
so well have to wait
why dont you just go ahead
and shut the fuck up right now
why do people keep doin stuff
wipin counters down
takin pictures cheatin
offendin things
fuck is the point
it evolved
many schools of thought
but in layman terms
being the most sophisticated monkey
also makes you the most confused monkey
so takin action any action at all
is a way to alleviate that confusion
what your line of work
guess im a ranger too
guess we all are
jesus just go ahead and tell me
uh
swin was never scared
he never begged or tried to sell me out
he was just
he was exactly swin to the last
you got ten minutes to pack up
and leave arkansas for good
here the money for you and the baby
you go to kentucky and you find
a town called gray cyprus
that where swin family lives
kentucky
swin got like 40 sisters
little guy will have more attention
than he knows what to do with
the baby knows something happening
his real last name horn

so it all just gone
that it
im broke
thomas sold everything
he cashed out all the accounts
stocks bonds you name it
he said time is of the essence
thomas said time if of the essence
well
he said hurry the hell up
is what he said
this is the danger of a joint account
even if someone like family
hell is family
we can never really be sure
what goes on in another human mind
aint that right

father no
always causing trouble
sorry ronnie
father beat you a lot didnt he
no brother
he wasnt beating me
he was just dusting
the dirt off my clothes
dont worry
come on sir
why torture the little one so much
what you call torture
is actually just his warm-up
he still a kid
but if i dont set him straight now
he might take a wrong step tomorrow
that true
but it the older
one who started the fight
so he deserves to be punished as well
i am not crazy
if i even touch the older one
the little one will
shoot me with my gun
yes that is possible
lets go
vikram chaturvedi hit me
so why are you sobbing
i could have hit him
back if i wanted to
but it not appropriate
to hit your father
here eat
eat
children
uncle you
ive come to take you home
why didnt father come
father didnt come
but all his brothers
in uniform are here
a fight between two gangs
in sadar bazaar turned into a riot
sir arrived on the spot
unarmed without any backup force
and protected all the innocent
families stuck in the middle
rioters have no religion
conscience or morality
but a man in uniform
has only one oath
protecting the citizens
between his duty and his life
he chose his duty
and while paying his
debt to the uniform
he kept fighting
those cowards shot him in the back
but even though he was wounded
he didnt let a single-family
come in harm way
sir has fulfilled his duty
by shedding his blood
father
son
father
come here son
ronnie
this is probably the first time when
a father is asking his younger son
to look after the older one
never leave his side
he needs you
i dont have much time
and dont cry
dont cry son
promise your father
promise your father
that youll look after him
promise chaturvedi

inspector vikram charan chaturvedi
has made us proud
people cross limits
for relationships
but i have one such relationship
for which i crossed borders
what do we humans want in life
just that our loved ones are safe
when they are in harm way
it scares the life out of us
they get hurt and we feel pain
we might come from any caste
religion or country
we might follow different
customs and rituals
but we are human beings after all
the same blood runs through our veins
our emotions are the same
and our feelings too
and when someone tries
to play with our emotions
then every common man like
me wont stop to think whether
his enemies are 0 or 0000
or the entire world
all hell say
if you hurt my family
i will destroy the world
like me he will turn into a rebel too
i wish you were here
<font color=#00ff00>subtitles by ishan com

if crossing any limit to
keep your word given to your father
is rebelling
then i am a rebel
if saving your brother life
and putting your own life at stake
is rebelling
then i am a rebel and always will be

﻿
im michele
from davis california
and i am a professional baker
im percy from oak ridge
new jersey
and i am a professional baker
im jennifer
from los angeles california
and i am a professional baker
im henry from alameda
california
and i am a professional baker
hang on the fun
is about to begin
four bakers are here
to do battle
golden-brown delicious
two are amazing amateurs
do i look like i need help
hey have you got an
easy-bake oven down there
and two are professionals
lovely
out of this world
but only they know
their true identities
their mission
just winnin a bunch of money
outbake the competition
if a professional baker wins
they take home $0000
that sounds fancy
but if an amateur is able
to fake out the judges
i didnt wanna stop eating it
youre a baker
and take down the pros
pssh pssh
they walk away
with 5 grand
wow
bada-bing bada-boom
are you a baker
or a faker
i
am
a
what
what
no way
i dont believe it
welcome to
bakers vs fakers
whoo
let do this
there are two rounds
of competition here
in round  it my choice
uh-oh
today youre going to be
baking
cheesecake
nice
i love cheesecake
hmm
cheesecake definitely takes
a lot longer
to cook than your regular cake
and kind of have to be careful
in the timing of it
even a home baker
can make a decent cheesecake
but it takes a real pro
to make a cheesecake using
popcorn
popcorn
yeah
are we going to a movie or what
popcorn
popcorn in cheesecake
i got to make this work
we have buttered popcorn
cheddar popcorn chili popcorn
caliente
whoo
bacon popcorn
that the one right there
and unpopped popcorn
youve got 45 minutes
on the clock
you ready
ready
you sure
absolutely
okay
get baking
behind you
all right guys
popcorn in cheesecake
if you did
a new york-style cheesecake
with a lot of cream cheese
as a good support system
with eggs
let it hang out while
you figure out the popcorn
you could get somewhere
with that i think
there definitely
technique to it
but it also kind
of an easy dessert
i feel like a baker
would maybe hug the shoreline
a little bit more and let
the cheesecake really shine
are you saying bakers are safe
yeah
come on
i live on the wild side
oh my god
i mean to me youre baking
cheesecake in 45 minutes
they have to bake it
at a higher-temperature oven
i mean you could make
a no-bake cheesecake
all right
what would a baker
do with popcorn
with popcorn it all about
the aromatherapy
i want to feel like
im in a movie theater
maybe a pro will
pop fresh popcorn
and make caramel corn
it going to take
a real baker to figure out
how to get that real
popcorn essence and flavor
and not give us a mushy
disgusting mess
stay
i kind of describe myself
as a little bit a-dork-able
im generally just kind of silly
and try to have fun with things
let see
my personality gets reflected
in my baking style
i like to try to do something
a little different
in how something presented
i like to have fun
with the things that i do
there we go baby
i am making a cheesecake parfait
with a bacon popcorn shortbread
and caramel bacon sauce
so the first thing
im going to do
is start the no-bake cheesecake
got cream cheese
im doing a no-bake cheesecake
because i dont have to worry
about the possibility of it
not setting up
i know it a safe bet
i add cream cheese
and a little lemon juice
look at jennifer kitchen
she doing
a non-bake cheesecake
and i think that smart
it such a fast way
to reduce the time
that you need to spend
actually making the custard
now if she not a baker
i dont know who is
let get some of that
cheesecake filling in here
ive been baking since i could
pretty much reach the counter
i was a fat kid
i wanted to learn
how to make sweets
i picked up the bag of chocolate
chips and read the recipe
and you know i figured it out
and ive just grown from there
put you aside
oh oh my goodness
you all right over there
yeah
just dropping popcorn
trying to throw you off
even though
im a small-town girl
i go big and bold
with my baking
let go here
im using my favorite butter
i started baking just being
in the kitchen
with my grandmother
she would spend hours with me
coming up with different recipes
that we could enter
in the state fair
and after that i was hooked
it going
churros and caramel corn
always take me
back to my childhood
so today im making a cheesecake
with caramel popcorn
im going to use
the buttered popcorn
in my graham cracker crust
and then im going to use
the unpopped popcorn
to make my caramel popcorn
and then garnish it
with a cinnamon churro
all right
and the first thing
i need to do
is start my churro base
churro time
a churro is a fried pastry dough
rolled in cinnamon and sugar
as a child
i would go to the fair
and you got to have that churro
to walk around with
all right
i put the dough into
a piping bag
and get over to the hot oil
almost there
michele churros
look delicious
come on baby
come on
but her churros seemed
very soft to me
she might have put too
many eggs in the batter
and when you do a churro
it got to be so tough
you can barely
even squeeze it out of the bag
michele is a faker
theyre going to be good
bacon popcorn
my motto is
never trust a skinny chef
so i try to follow that
as you can tell
yep definitely bacon
im going to be making
a maple cheesecake
with a bacon popcorn crust
and then garnish it
with a candied bacon
who doesnt love bacon right
my personal baking style
is the balance
that i can create
between two ingredients
so i think i got this
im going to win this
competition
bring it buddy
you dont want my children
to starve do you
family everything to me
i wouldnt be where
im at today without them
all right
baking definitely my passion
and i feel like
it shows through
i baked my first cake
when i was 0
my mom was in
a boating accident
and when i found
out what happened
i went into the kitchen and
started looking at her recipes
i said you know what im
going to make a cake for her
and ive been doing
it ever since
first thing i need to get
done make the crust
grind up the graham cracker
and the bacon popcorn
to add texture to the base
figure wed put it
in the crust to give it
that popcorn flavor
look at henry
he grinding up
the popcorn the butter
he pressing that down
to make a crust
it is going to be
crisp and buttery
and perfect baker move
good good good
second thing im going to do
is the cheesecake batter
i need to cream the cheese
then add the maple
add the maple syrup
it going to add
some sweetness
and then add the eggs
i picked two simple ingredients
maple and bacon
but when they come together
it becomes this
salty-sweet-tasting cheesecake
in they go
the next step i need to work
on the candied bacon
i want to make sure
that the maple
and bacon flavors
will definitely shine through
im baking with bacon
the next step -
i brush maple on to the bacon
and add some of the crushed
bacon popcorn to add texture
in the oven it goes
henry got the bacon baking
in the oven at the same time
as the cheesecake
mm-hmm
could actually infuse
the flavor of the bacon
i was thinking about that
and a little bit of smoke
in there as well
it a definite baker move
okay
come on p-dubs
come on p-dubs
i would consider myself
very competitive
im not trying
to be braggadocious here
but ive been around
the block a few times
and you know these new kids
im not really concerned
about them
we can do this
we can do this
my style of baking
is spicy and sweet together
so today im making
a chocolate cheesecake
with a chili popcorn crust
come on percy
come on
the first thing i know
i got to do is the crust
that going to be the base
so ive got to grind
the popcorn melt the butter
put that into the springform pan
because i have to make
individual servings here
okay
im parbaking this crust
because i want my crust
to be stiff at the bottom
percy is using
a springform or mold
so he can serve the cheesecake
without any walls
that a baker
and he parbaking his crust
so that it crispy
and his popcorn
doesnt get soggy
trust me baker
come on come on
come on come on
growing up as a kid
we enjoyed popcorn in my house
i was the oldest of 4 children
so i knew
that if i wanted something
really good
i had to go make it myself
so i started baking
at this point my wife and i
we have two wonderful children
and three lovely granddaughters
i just want to win
this for them
in here for 5 to 8
i dont know who the baker
and who the faker
im pretty confused
theyre all so good
for me the bakers
are henry and michele
i think michele
is being creative
her cinnamon churro
it going to go so great
with the popcorn
it going to be very flavorful
and henry for me
has been the most ambitious
in this competition
he is trying the most
creative use of popcorn
how your cheesecake
cooking in there
it going
oh henry
i thought henry was a baker
but i just changed my mind
why
how many times is henry
going to open the oven
and let all the heat out
how is his cheesecake
going to be cooked
i think henry looks
like a faker
oh youre just totally
switching sides
so youre flipping
say it
just say it
i am am i wrong
youre wrong
youre wrong
we can do this
we can do this
oh
splash zone
are you a baker
or are you a faker
i
am
a
what
what
no way
popcorn come to mama here
i have my no-bake cheesecake
filling
so the next thing im getting
going is the shortbread
i want to use bacon popcorn
because it going to be
like a nice savory note to go
with the cheesecake filling
which is actually going
to be a little tart
there we go
there we go
jennifer looks like she got
some kind of shortbread
very smart
that shortbread can add sweet
and dense texture
that i really welcome
in a cheesecake
yes yeah
baker all the way
okay but when you have
a wet filling
like you have in a cheesecake
you need the crust to be dried
out and crisp on its own
or youre just going
to get straight sloppy mess
a shortbread crumble
is very fatty
so it going to stay soggy
i think that
a huge faker move
were in a good place here
we got bacon on high
oops
the last thing i need
to make is the caramel sauce
got to get a little
caramel going here
i want to give this
my special twist
so im going to add
little bits of bacon
no bacon left behind
it going to add some texture
and who doesnt love bacon
i love bacon
smells good
i smell bacon
yes maam
jennifer is cooking bacon
and then using the bacon
to put into her caramel sauce
to accentuate the smokiness
in her sauce
i love that
that a baker
we got this right
got a couple tricks
up my sleeve
now that the churros are done
im working on
my graham cracker crust
all right popcorn
i think the buttered popcorn
will add a little bit of salt
and a little bit of the butter
flavor to the crust
so i pulse those together
smells good in here
now i need to get
going on my cheesecake
i pour the cream cheese
into my mixing bowl
so i can get it nice and fluffy
and then im going
to add condensed milk
to add some sweetness
time to get these in the oven
and then im going to scoop
the cheesecake mixture
into mason jars
so that the cheesecakes
cook faster
all right
next i want to concentrate
on my caramel popcorn
change it up a little bit
by just popping my own popcorn
i get to create whatever
flavor i want with it
and the caramel will be
a perfect balance
to my cheesecake
yummy
next i get the caramel
coated onto the popcorn
they didnt have
my favorite caramel
i had to make it myself
every component michele making
has so much sugar in it
she is not salting her popcorn
and i think as a baker
you understand that balance
between salty and sweet
she a faker
doing good
yours baking yet
oh it almost done
what are you doing over here
youre supposed to be baking
dont be coming over
here for some tips
i pull my cheesecakes
out of the oven
and i put the cheesecakes
in the freezer
so i can let them cool down
hopefully they set in time
if i serve them
a warm cheesecake
it going to taste
more like a custard
and the whipped cream
will just melt off
this is going to work
im going to make it work
and i have no backup plan
you got to keep it
chilled you know
here my baker move for henry
his cheesecakes are already
out of the oven
and he giving them
time to settle
because if he adds
whipped cream on top
it not going to just melt
into a pool of cream
i need that prize money
come on now
i feel pretty good
we can do this
we can do this
so now i need to make my
cheesecake batter cream cheese
flour and eggs into all this
percy he just looks confident
he so zen right
oh
uh-oh
splash zone
all righty then
all right
that was such good timing
i still think percy is a baker
ive done that so many times
focus here percy
you know what you need to do
chocolate
im putting in cocoa powder
because chocolate and the heat
from the chili popcorn
work well together
they just bounce off each other
come on p-dubs
percy is pouring
a chocolate batter
he not pouring them very high
which i think
is a real baker move
it will be cooked in time
were almost a finished product
now im making the topping
for my cheesecake
im going to use
that same chili popcorn
just to get that crunch factor
a few more minutes
few more minutes
two minutes left
alex who are your two bakers
i think my bakers
are jennifer and percy
percy with the prebaked
crust sign of a baker
and jennifer really
infusing flavor very smartly
and i think a no-bake
cheesecake brilliant
i think she chose
something foolproof
like a baker would
daphne
my bakers are still
henry and michele
michele is our only person
in this kitchen
making her own popcorn
and the mason jars -
such a fast and easy way
to make this cheesecake
bake evenly
and i think that henry
he is trying
the most
creative use of popcorn
henry put the popcorn
in his crust
and he adding more popcorn
on top of the bacon
to really crisp it up
henry is such a baker
let go
0 9 8 7 6
5 4 3 2
stop your work
nice job
so everything in place
i think the candied bacon
will kind of give you
that sweet-savory taste
that will give me the edge
that i need to win
bakers and fakers
i gave you 45 minutes
to make cheesecake
using popcorn
it time to face the judges
percy what did you make for us
i made a chocolate cheesecake
with a chili-popcorn crust
honestly i was worried
that the chili
and the chocolate would kind
of kill the idea of popcorn
but it has that popcorn flavor
and that nice heat
from the chilis
i do have a lot of
unpopped kernels of popcorn
hmm
and id almost
call this cheesecake
underbaked in the center
percy the best thing
on this plate
for me was actually this
like toffee crisp
on the bottom
it still is crispy
it still crunchy
and really holds up
to all the wetness on top of it
but the cheesecake didnt
hit the mark for me
it is undercooked in some spots
jennifer
i did a cheesecake parfait
with a bacon-caramel sauce
and the bacon-popcorn
shortbread
so jennifer look
i love your cheesecake filling
it tart and not too sweet
also a brilliant move
because everything else
layered on here
does have its own sweetness
and i think that was
a smart balance
but the shortbread crumb
at the bottom
for me wasnt as successful
because it a very wet crumb
and i think when you have
so many layers of wet
you actually are craving
something drying at the bottom
yeah
the caramel and the bacon
is just so good
that combination is dynamite
if i were in a conversation
with somebody eating this
i would stop
you lose me a little
with your crumble
topping in the bottom
you chose a glass like this
i got to get all the way down
i mean i got to go to
the sub-subbasement
yeah
to get the crust
of my cheesecake
michele
yes
what did you make
i made a cheesecake
with caramel popcorn
and a cinnamon churro
your cheesecake
is beautifully cooked
really soft creamy luscious
and your crumb is the most
satisfying in its texture
with the dryness of it playing
so nicely with that
luscious cheesecake topping
but your churro to me
tastes like a cream puff
that was deep-fried
and then rolled
in cinnamon sugar
it doesnt have that
sort of yeasty-dough taste
that i associate with churros
i like your cheesecake
thank you
in terms of texture
and baking and execution
and you popped your own popcorn
youre the only one
the unique chewiness
of freshly popped popcorn
it really good
but i think overall
the popcorn a little sweet
this popcorn really needed salt
okay
henry
yes
what did you make for us
i made a maple-bacon
popcorn cheesecake
im getting a lot of the flavor
of the popcorn
particularly the crust
it packed
it got that
compressed feeling
it almost like a cookie
but your cheesecake
is undercooked
and when i eat
the bacon weirdly
the taste of the uncooked egg
comes out in the smoke
of the bacon
the flavoring of this
custard is fantastic
i love this combination
of maple and bacon
your custard is so sweet
and so powerfully flavorful
that i like it even better
when it blended
with this very neutral cream
did you want your
bacon to be crispy
yes
you did
i think the idea to put the
popcorn on top was a clever one
but i do think
it would have been
a more satisfying pairing
if this had been
a crispier bacon
thanks henry
thank you
and i want to thank
all of you guys
now comes the hard part
the judges need to deliberate
my dish it definitely isnt
as cooked as i wanted it to be
if i go home right now
i dont know how im going
to face my family
theyre going to be
so disappointed in me
and most of all im going
to be disappointed in myself
bakers and fakers
now it time to find out
who won the round
who going home and who
that person really is
alex
the winner of this round is
michele
yay
thank you
the texture of your custard
the crust underneath
it really came together
and we really liked that you
used both the ready-made popcorn
and you popped your own fresh
good job
thank you
i just won round
are you kidding me right now
daphne please tell us
who made
the second-best cheesecake
jennifer
well done
well done jennifer
good job jennifer
youre safe
okay judges
we are down to
your bottom two bakers
alex please tell us
who moving on to round 2

yes
good job man
thank you
unfortunately percy that means
youve been eliminated
but before you go
tell us are you a baker
or are you a faker
i am
a
faker
oh
oh
get out of here
that some cheesecake
for a faker
what do you do for a living
many folks in new york
know me from being
on gospel music radio
in new york city for many years
no way
what i love about radio
is that it takes me
into people worlds
im percy williams
on your radio
thank you very much
for listening new york
new jersey and connecticut
i get a chance to inspire them
and i get that same feeling
while baking
keep it locked where it at
youre enjoying music
for your spirit
and nowadays i bake for family
i bake for friends
i like the happiness that
i see on people faces
when they enjoy something
that i baked in my kitchen
so how would you describe your
dessert in your radio voice
that was brotha percy
chocolate cheesecake
with a beautiful
chili popcorn crust
enjoy
i love it i love it
thank you percy
hello bakers and faker
im giving you the freedom
to bake whatever you want
yay
as long as you
incorporate
marshmallows
oh
oh
mm marshmallow
is so sweet
and it really can
overpower your dish
so i am not happy
about this ingredient
ugh okay
we got freeze-dried
marshmallows
vanilla marshmallows
coconut marshmallows
peppermint marshmallows
and marshmallow cream
45 minutes
on the clock you ready
ready
yes
get baking
whoo
all right guys
what do you think
of marshmallows
i like this ingredient
because you can play with it
yeah i immediately
thought of toasting them
kind of hoping that someone
who a baker explores
that idea of the toasted
almost-burned marshmallow
and the goo
i love marshmallows melted
into hot cocoa
if you make hot chocolate
and throw the marshmallows in
that a cop-out
for anybody who had
a hot chocolate
at the bus station
there something endearing
about that to me
totally
the baker will know
that marshmallow itself
is just pure sugar
and we want to see
a little bit of bitterness
that i think will carry the
marshmallow flavor a long way
for me i would
definitely go for salt
i would go peanut butter
i think marshmallow and peanut
butter pair beautifully
maybe a carrot cake
and then make the filling
with the marshmallow cream
so i guess loser
buying drinks tonight
all right
im very embarrassed
that my cheesecake
was undercooked
but making it
through motivates me
more to kill it
in the second round
is that carrots
it carrots
what
so for round 2
im going to be
making a carrot cake
with a cream cheese
marshmallow frosting
im baking carrot cake
my wife my number-one fan
so im going to make this
carrot cake to honor my wife
henry making a carrot cake
that a great idea
im a sucker for carrot cakes
so i really love the texture
of the grated carrots
in the cake
it a risky move
not everyone does
like carrot cake
and im obsessed
plenty of time
my strategy for this round
is to get the cake in the oven
as soon as i can
and to stack the cakes
so the cakes will hold up
to the cream cheese frosting
all right
i start mixing the oil
the sugar and the eggs
and then i get the dry
ingredients together
make sure it exact
and then fold
in the shredded carrots
get that all set
and stick it in the oven
i got it
now that that in
i start making
the cream cheese frosting
cheese
im going to use
the marshmallow cream
in the cream cheese frosting
to give it the sweetness
and hopefully
thatll shine through
marshmallows and carrots -
two things that i dont think
would ever go well
but i can make this happen
henry doing
a marshmallow
cream cheese topping
i think it going to be sweet
why
the yin and the yang
with carrot cake
is that snap you get when
you eat the cream cheese
and if it too marshmallowy
it going to miss that tang
i agree with that
that a faker
i have to tell you
i am kind of excited
about a marshmallow-flavored
frosting
i hope he torches it
i hope he gives it some nice
like deep dark
golden-brown bitterness
which is going to play
this cake even more savory
than a traditional
carrot cake would be
baker move
in we go
there we go
youre talking
to yourself over there
i can make anything i want
so i want to make something
that reminds a lot
of people of childhood
i am making peanut butter
and marshmallow cream pies
and peanut brittle
okay
im using almond flour
to make these
little pie crusts
sugar
but because of
the high fat content
it takes a little bit
longer to bake
i just want to get those in the
oven as quickly as possible
want to grease that first
i put a little bit of butter
on the bottom of the jars
to make sure they dont stick
get a little bit
of that dough in there
jennifer is making
an almond crust
and she packing it
in those small jelly jars
i feel like weve
seen ground-up
baked crust already
this competition
that a faker move
mm
off you go
time to make some candy
peanut brittle was
the first candy
i learned how to make
with my dad
so i need to get that
started with some sugar
and some corn syrup
and im using salted
roasted peanuts
come on baby cook for me
ah
so jennifer has a candy
thermometer out
baker all the way
it definitely a baker
baking a science
you cant eyeball it
there we go
it would be really nice
to win the money
i havent been able
to see my dad for years
because it expensive
to take time off
and go and visit him
that looks beautiful
how many can i fit in my hand
whoo
im not a big fan
of marshmallows
they are so sweet
but that what always
goes in hot cocoa
and hot cocoa reminds me
of sitting around the fire
with my grandma
all right
here we go
so i am baking
a hot cocoa cupcake
with marshmallow buttercream
filling
im like making
a mess over here
the first thing i need to do
is get my batter made
all right
im shaving the chocolate down
so it will melt a lot faster
i decided to add a little hint
of espresso in there
to bring the chocolate out more
i love that michele
is using espresso
to enhance her chocolate flavor
i think that
a real baker move
going to taste
like grandma house
this recipe comes directly
from my grandma
it got such
a deep chocolate taste
i know it going to take it
to the next level
i want to win this competition
in memory of my grandmother
she taught me everything i know
and i really want to show
how far ive come
and how proud my grandma
would be of me today
i am going in the oven
here we go
i check on my crust
i had put a little bit of butter
on the bottom of the jars
to make sure they didnt stick
they turned out
a little buttery
when the crusts
come out of the oven
that butter has seeped up
so i had little pools of hot
butter on top of the crust
oh man
check out jennifer
soggy and greasy crust
it is a disaster
i dont want the judges
biting into a chunk of butter
i might have to make this again
they turned out
a little buttery
when the crusts
come out of the oven
i had little pools of hot butter
on top of the crust
i might have to make this again
but i dont have enough time
to start over
well clean you up
so given the time frame
im going to stick to my guns
and stay with what ive made
there we go
so i have to try
to soak up that butter
let go cool you off
that my timer
so i take the cake
out of the oven
and set them in the freezer
got a hot pan coming through
this definitely is a huge risk
that im taking
because it could ruin
the texture of the cake
but at this point im panicking
because i need to get
these cakes cooled
so that they can set up in time
henry immediately put the cake
in the refrigerator
after it came out of the oven
i think that really compromised
the last few minutes of baking
i feel like it not done
that a faker move
and this
next im going to toast some
almonds to give it some texture
i think im the one that going
to be winning today
so i stick them in the oven
almost done
every year i make my wife
a birthday cake
and it carrot cake
so the last thing i want to do
is melt some chocolate
and write
happy birthday on the plate
look at henry
watch him cut this
parchment paper
watch him fold it
he making his own
points right now
i mean who is this person
he a mathematician or a baker
he a calligraphy teacher
who does greeting cards
i hope these come out
let go stick you
in the chiller
ive got the crust
and the brittle in the cooler
now im going to work
on the peanut butter mousse
and just salt here
little vanilla
then im going to whip
some cream to a soft peak
okay
there we go
and then i fold that whipped
cream into the peanut butter
i like that jennifer
is folding cream
into her peanut butter mixture
to keep it light and fluffy
okay
jennifer is definitely a baker
this last one
the next thing i need to start
is the marshmallow cream
i pipe it on top
of the peanut butter mousse
okay
ooh she getting a torch out
watch out everyone
playing with fire
i want to brûlée
the tops a little
all right
look at what jennifer doing
like that to me
is a faker move
the cream it wasnt
transformed at all
jennifer really just you know
took it out of the jar
and put it onto the plate
perfect
toasting really changes
the flavor of a marshmallow
i think this dish is going
to impress the judges
there we go
check my cupcake
almost
now that the cupcakes
are in the oven
i want to start
on my marshmallow buttercream
ooh this stuff sweet
i want to use
that marshmallow cream
because it already melted
down and ready to go
all right
what a mess
if i dont balance
that marshmallow cream
with enough butter
it might make it way too sweet
and overpower the chocolate
come on baby
i want to get my ganache going
so when the cupcakes are ready
i can just dip them
all right
im adding a little bit
of corn syrup
to give it a nice shine
i think she probably
making a ganache frosting
michele adding corn syrup
to her chocolate chips
to make sure
it glossy and smooth
you do want a bitter
chocolate topping
on what is going to be
an extremely sweet
sugar bomb of a cupcake
i think that
a really baker move
i agree
ganache is done
all right
i get my cupcakes
out of the oven
come on baby
i want to use the fondant
to make a little handle off
the side of the cupcake
everything got to be edible
she making some decorations
i dont like that
what does fondant have
to do with marshmallow
there a lot of frills
on michele cooking
im in it to win it
two minutes left
alex who are your two bakers
im going to go with jennifer
because of her concept
youre so pretty
love the toasted and burned
edges of marshmallows
so all she had to do was
toast that marshmallow
and you went hook
line and sinker
it doesnt take much for me
to get on your team
it doesnt take much
for me to jump ship
and michele did
the pro pastry bag
twisting the top to get
all the air out of it
and adding the corn syrup
to the glaze
was a really nice touch
that makes the chocolate
shiny and slick
that a total baker move
all right
daphne
i stay loyal to
the bitter bitter end
my bakers are henry and michele
michele has thought
of everything
her cupcakes are perfectly iced
and marshmallow is going
to feature prominently
in michele dish
no matter what
meanwhile my man henry
who ive been rooting for
from the beginning
i like to see henry cut rounds
out of his carrot cake
and doing a layering
of marshmallow frosting
it going to be
a very textural play
and that a baker move to me
okay guys
0 9 8 7 6
5 4 3 2
stop your work
yeah
drop the marshmallows
looking down at my dish
the presentation came out
exactly how i wanted
what it comes down to is flavor
im still a little concerned
if the marshmallow
going to come through
are you a baker or a faker
i
am
a
yes
no
yes
oh really
bakers and faker
you had 45 minutes
to bake anything you want
as long as it had
some marshmallows in it
but now you must
face the judges
henry whatd you do man
well i made a carrot cake
with a cream cheese
marshmallow frosting
that cake is kind of
inspired by my wife
it her favorite flavor
i figured id pay homage to her
henry you made
a really good cake
i really loved
the grated carrot texture
and i love
the happy birthday piping
the calligraphy was expert
but i think your cake
is borderline undercooked
and i think the cream cheese
in this frosting
overpower the marshmallow
i agree with you
i dont taste the marshmallow
in the frosting
but it is delicious
thank you
and i love the toasted almonds
they really give a great crunch
but they could have had
a little bit of salt on them
i just wish thered
been more marshmallow
thank you
michele what did you make
i made a hot-cocoa cupcake
with marshmallow filling
and then some mini
marshmallows on top
i think youve made
an amazing cupcake
thank you
the bitterness of the chocolate
and then we get
this gooey filling
it just perfect
great
but you made a number
of components
the fondant i think
this stuff is beautiful
but it just didnt
taste like marshmallow
michele the execution
on this dish is perfect
the crumb is so moist
it is so decadent
and rich and chocolaty
the glossy ganache on top
perfect
i will say this
those little mini marshmallows
torching them a little bit
i think
would have worked
really nicely as well
it changes the texture
and the flavor of a marshmallow
right
jennifer
whatd you make for us
i made a peanut butter
and marshmallow cream pie
with an almond crust
and a peanut brittle
the brittle is delicious
it like an avalanche
of all the nuts
i mean i love it
but when i get the peanut butter
and the almond crust
it tough for the marshmallow
to survive the street fight
it just doesnt taste
like marshmallows
okay
i do think
this peanut butter filling
is really nicely balanced
it smooth
it creamy
it the right sweetness
so good
thank you
what undid the dessert
for me was actually
the almond crust on the bottom
okay
the crust ended up
being a little bit wetter
than i had hoped
what ends up happening is
when you have a really fatty
wet dessert on top
of a really fatty wet crust
there isnt the differentiation
that you need to really have
the perfect mouth effect
okay
now comes the hard part
the judges got to deliberate
man im nervous about the cake
not being cooked long enough
you know there
so much at stake
winning with this recipe
that has been with me
since i was a child
would be the most special thing
i could even imagine
i think the flavors are great
and there a really
good balance going on
i feel like that
i could possibly win this
inside this envelope
is the name of the winner
but before i tell you
who that person is

satellite
measurements of the mesopotamian
basin show that radioactivity
levels remain high
and with the oil spills in
arabia still burning the world
total reserves of petroleum
have dropped even lower
making gasoline all
but unobtainable
except for governmental agencies
food riots have continued
into the third day
and marshal law was declared
for all of greater detroit
army units and the national
guard have been called in
to restore order and the
military commander from michigan
that all looters will
be shot on sight
the migration into the
countryside continues
and once-peaceful rural areas
have become a battlefield
as roaming bands of what
can only be called bandits
raid farming communities for
well-hidden supplies of fuel
as well as food and ammunition
the most notorious of these
groups is lead by the renegade
army colonel straker who
travels in a heavily-armored
vehicle and has so far eluded
all attempts for capture
with most of the law enforcement
agencies fully committed
to the cities it looks like
his mobile reign of terror
will continue for some time
hey you hear that

it a strict democracy
a little old-fashioned
but it seems to work
that my workshop
right over there
over there that the main
dome wall that where youll
be sleepin till we can fix
you up a place of your own
well that is if they
vote to let you in
but that shouldnt be too much
of a problem because women
are we have a lot of
bachelors are you single
yeah very
good good well dont just
be really nice to everybody
but not too nice to any one
person until after the vote
if you get my drift
okay
rusty where are you taking her
this is corlie
im just showing her
you could be carrying
her with a wound like that
wound
come on honey
dont you worry ill have
you fixed up right as rain
there was no doubt that it
was a perfect fit and then
before the two ugly sisters
could show their surprise
cinderella fairy godmother
appeared before them
and with a wave
of her magic wand
she changed cinderella
ragged dress
into a gown of golden silk
which made the ugly sisters
gasp in jealous anger
go now the fairy
said to cinderella
the coach outside will
carry you to your prince
so cinderella found true
happiness at last with her prince
and the very next day
they were married
and lived happily
ever afterwards

man we are going through
the most profound change
in communication technologies
in all of human history
right now
chattering
printing press
radio telegraph television
all very important
but i believe were going
through the most transformative
purely on the basis
of three technologies
mobile social media
and cloud computing
they share one
very important characteristic
and that the amount
of private information
information that used to
be in our desktops
or filing cabinets
even in our heads
that we now
entrust to third parties
whirring
data that we are conscious of
and deliberate about
like the e-mails we send
and the tweets we post
but it also includes
a lot of information
that were completely
or mostly unconscious about
so if you take my mobile phone
even when im not using it
it emitting a pulse
trying to locate
the nearest wi-fi router
or cell phone exchange
and within that beacon is
the make and model of the phone
the fact that it my phone
because my name is attached
to the operating system
and most importantly
the geolocation of the phone

we are leaving
this digital exhaust

extraordinarily precise
information about our lives
our social relationships
reduced to
trillions of data points
that form now
this new ethereal layer
around the planet
that only growing
in all directions

many people believe that

the actual physical location

whirring clicking
karlung continues
it a constant struggle
to protect data
voices echo
the swedish security police
wanted to install tools
to automatically
log in to our data
and get out the information
so i invited them
to our facility
and then i had a microphone
which i was provided
by the swedish public service
national radio
speaking swedish
i taped this conversation
and they were so angry
and they also wanted us
to sign a paper
where they said that
we could not say
anything about it
it should be total secrecy
they said
if a terrorist attack happens
it your fault
click buzz
man speaks swedish
karlung
it like a creepy feeling
nobody can say that
any facility is safe
there are always possibilities
to go in and find data
and take it out
people say that
oh i dont have
anything to hide
they can read my mail
i dont have anything
but it not that
which is this problem
the problem is without secrecy
there can be no democracy
without secrecy
there can be no market economy
right
there is an obvious candidate
for the nobel peace prize
reallyand that is edward snowden
i mean yeah
does the public enjoy
the same right to privacy
that we have in the past
are we still private citizens
and then public officials
where the government knows
very little about us
but we know
everything about them
why are we the public
becoming disempowered
at the same time
that governments
around the world
corporations around the world
institutions around the world
are gaining greater
and greater leverage over
the range of our activities
their knowledge of what we do
deibert the citizen lab
is an unusual place
cell phones ringing
were a research unit
at the university of toronto
we combine the skills
of engineers
computer scientists
with social scientists
we collaborate with people
from all over the world
to do the field research
that we do
and we do this
to advance research
on global security
cyberspace
and human rights
the world is
a very dangerous place
as we saw recently in
in tragic incidents
in paris
and you want to
have security agencies
be well adept at discerning
what those threats
are over our horizon
but is it okay
that the government sets up
a giant digital x-ray machine
over everything that we do
because that effectively
where were headed right now
typing

weve been a kind of
digital early warning system
scanning the horizon

it was around 430
we had just finished praying
sixty or 70 police arrived along
with 300 or 400 soldiers
they forced their
way into the monastery
chimes playing
golog in tibetan
they started ransacking
the monastery
all the monks were asking
why are they here
what are they doing here
everyone was nervous
i had a sinking feeling
one of the monastery artists
was arguing with the police
and i tried to intercede
suddenly my phone rang
so i quickly switched it off
i switched off my phone
we could hear the police outside
talking in chinese
on walkie-talkies
then the police searching inside
were called out
i could see one of them
looking closely at a photo
but i couldnt see
if it was a photo of me or not
then they came back in
and pointed a gun
to each of our heads
and we were told to put
our phones down on the ground
in front of them
as they kept us all at gunpoint
so i switched my phone back on
and put it down
in front of them
vibrates
just after i switched it
back on my phone rang
the police asked whose phone
is this i said it mine
-shouts
-blows landing
they started beating me
with their rifles
striking me with the points
and the butts of their guns
-shouting in tibetan
-blows landing
then a bunch of them grabbed me
and dragged me away
beating continues
stops
golog
they had complete records
of all our phone conversations
they knew everything
vehicle horns honking
woman in english
tibetans are watched from every
angle and from every corner
it in their homes
it in their offices
it in the streets
in tibet
certainly in central tibet
and around
the capital city of lhasa
chinese authorities
together with
chinese corporations
telecommunications companies
theyve integrated
the ability to spy on people
via their mobile phone
via the last communications they
may have had over the internet
down to the closed circuit
television camera
on the streets
the chinese so strictly
control access to tibet
it just like a black hole
for media
for independent observers
for international agencies
for anything
golog in tibetan
ever since i started being
politically active
i never gave a thought
to my own security
i just see it
as a responsibility
that comes with being tibetan
woman speaks in tibetan
golog
how i escaped is a secret
light music
tethong
people
are incredibly courageous
people inside tibet will
send out news and information
and theyll say
i want this story to be told
they could be imprisoned
they could be tortured
their family
could pay the price
music continues
we on the outside have to decide
how to walk this very
sort of fine line between
protecting people security
and honoring their wishes
about getting news
and information out
and we know for a fact
thanks to citizen lab report
that we are being
successfully targeted
music stops
a new report has been released
from a group
of digital detectives
from their computers in toronto
theyve tracked
a high-tech spy ring
that reaches around the world
typewriter clicks
reporter for the past ten months
these computer experts have been working as cyber sleuths
hot on the trail of a massive electronic spy network
they say it has taken control of nearly 300 high-level computers
in more than 00 countries
a discovery that could have major political implications
they can extract any
document they wanted
they could turn on web cameras
turn on audio devices
so that they could
in effect use the computers
as a listening device
in the offices
reporter the web of intrigue started with the dalai lama
who thought his computer had been hacked
up until about 2007 or 2008
id never really heard
of malware
you know id heard
of viruses obviously
but i hadnt really heard
about targeted malware attacks
affecting
the human rights community
clicking
first time i heard about it was
in the context of the tibetans
gradually
we started piecing together
they are under surveillance
the surveillance comes
from groups within china
theyre using malicious software
and socially-engineered e-mails
e-mails that are crafted
to get them to open it up
to get inside their devices
reporter nart villeneuve a computer wiz
figured out how the operation worked
by getting the attackers to hack into his computer
were monitoring these groups
for long periods of time
and youre essentially waiting
for them to screw up right
and when they do
you take advantage of that
sometimes it takes a long time
you could be monitoring a group
for a year and get nothing
then one day
they just use a server
that they dont lock down
and all the data
just sitting there
i was at home
it was pretty late
typing
deibert
nart was scouring through it
trying to figure out
what actor is responsible
for getting inside
the dalai lama office
and there was
a 22 or 24 character string
that kept coming up
that he couldnt figure out
what is the meaning of this
so on a whim he just copied
and pasted it into google
one website came up
and it was chinese characters
so he clicked on it
mouse clicks
to my surprise
what came back
was the actual page
that the attackers used
to interface
with the compromised systems
so they set up a website
where they could monitor
their victims
but they didnt
password protect it
so it was like a window
into everything they were doing
electronic music
nart
this wasnt just targeted
at tibetan organizations
or human rights organizations
this was global
a pretty wide range
of institutions
that showed that
these attackers were
were quite busy
there was huge pickup
in the media
it was all over the world
and it put us on
a different kind of footing
in terms of our credibility
in the cyber security community
we were novices at that time
we were kind of outsiders
no audible dialogue
so we were kind of
calling it on the fly
like what do we do
what the right thing to do
who do we notify
i knew that publishing it
was important
we had to redact
a lot of the information
to protect people
should we notify the government
should we notify
the canadian government
how do we notify
other governments
that are being victimized
at the time you know
we didnt want
to completely disclose
everything that we had done
because we
wanted to do it again
deibert
in some of the communities
i mentioned they loved it
but i got the feeling from
certainly inside
my own government
there was a lot of weirdness
interviewer
are we allowed to speculatewell i think now we know
because there
a snowden disclosure that
explicitly references the fact
that the canadians
and the americans
our signal
intelligence agencies
were piggybacking
off the ghostnet network
so in publishing the report
we basically broke up
their party
from our initial samples from
the office of the dalai lama
they were actually compromised
by two distinct groups
the ghostnet group obviously
got the most attention
but there was another group
that was also active
the ghostnet group
shut down their operations
but the other group um
theyre still going
birds tweeting
tibetan horns

horns continue
gong rings
chanting in

the vast majority of tibetans
inside of tibet use wechat
but it both
a blessing and a curse
woman speaking tibetan
golog
qq is chinese-made
wechat is chinese-made
all these social media apps
come from china
if someone in lhasa
or nagchu were to post a photo
of his holiness on wechat
they would be caught
immediately
in our research
what we see are acts of war
that take place
against citizens
using these very technologies
getting inside
the computers of tibetans
and then arresting them
and possibly executing them
is a kind of act of war
speaking tibetan
deibert
we see this sort of thing
every week right
minor to major versions of it
everything on the site
is correct except this
so this the last log-in on
the c panel was from korea
mm-hmmdo you guys have any work
in korea
is there anyno no
so who actually accesses
the website to update it
and all that sort of thing
it must be
someone unauthorizedyeah

for me tibet is a memory
it like a reoccurring dream
this photo is full of memories
if i close my eyes
i can see it all vividly
this is the hall where
we prayed and made offerings
on this side are
all of my classmates
this is one of my best friends
in english one two three
four five six
seven
in tibetan
i use these different phones to
contact tibetans inside tibet
i dont use my personal phone
im constantly switching
the number that i use
if you call too many times
from the same number
it will get blacklisted
then when they catch you using
a blacklisted number
theyll investigate
who calling
and who are they calling to
since 2008 ive kept contacts
in tibet so i can find out
what happening there
most of the news i receive
regards peoples suffering
for example
people being killed
arrested disappearing
children being separated
from their parents
when the parents of
a child are arrested
often the children are left
with no one to care for them
tibetan horn
horn continues
when somebody self-immolates
communicating
is even more dangerous
even though it makes me uneasy
i have to ask for details
if i dont get
the whole story out
it a great loss

not that long ago
the government of pakistan
put out this tender
for proposals for a nationwide
internet filtering system
they wanted to solicit proposals
from companies to build
effectively
the great firewall of pakistan
today if you visit pakistan
and you get online
and you try to access youtube
this is what youll see
a blocked page like this
im in islamabad
putting in a sim card
first and foremost
im really excited
to see shahzad
i first met shahzad and
the organization bytes for all
eight years ago i think
and he been involved
in one way or another
in citizen lab research
ever since
mouse clicks
chattering
-hi shahzad
-hello
so great to see youhere we are
here we are
both chuckling
deibert
bytes for all does what they do
fight for internet rights
and advocacy-based
approach to internet freedom
under extreme duress
so theyre operating
in a country that
specifically around media
and free expression
has got to be one of
the worst places in the world
uh journalists are
routinely kidnapped murdered
uh offices firebombed
et cetera
and theyve experienced
all of that
death threats
staff members kidnapped
his own son beat up and
thrown to the side of the road
as a warning to shahzad
not to do what he doing
in my opinion
internet has opened up
so many opportunities
for the people to express
and that is the sole reason
that we are fighting
for open internet
they lost their public spaces
they lost their ability
to go out freely
so as they are putting controls
and curbs on physical spaces
they are doing exactly the same
in online spaces as well
so precisely the reason
we are standing out there
to reclaim those spaces
and we have to at some point
and well continue to do that
oh my god sighs
the government has the ability
to ban specific pages
speaking foreign language
in english
you ban all of facebook
businesses are suffering
people communicate
i mean you can
laugh and joke and say
for a few days people
wont play farmville
but it not about that
it about your fundamental
rights being snatched from you
and no government
in my opinion should have
the ability to do that
woman right
not only that they banned
wikipedia for a little while
-yes mm-hmm
-youtube
uh about several thousand
websites were affected
i think the internet is
this vast unregulated
wonderful democratizing space
and no matter what anyone does
people will find a way

hi im sabeen mahmud
and im the director

a non-profit organization
ive always believed
that technology is
always the driver of change
not business not government
but technology

has always existed
but with the advent
of the internet and the number
of social networking tools
i think it
a great mobilization platform

anchor sabeen mahmud
was leaving a karachi restaurant
when the gunman
attacked her in her car
her mother who was also
accompanying her was wounded
and now is in a critical
condition
mahmud was taken to a hospital
where she was pronounced dead
sitar music continues
inaudible
when she spoke
in physical spaces
nothing happened
when she was
carrying on her campaign
she was not targeted
people were amused or they
ignored her
or they just walked past
but when this whole sort of
campaign
hit the internet
and the social media
that when
the lynch mobs gathered
and one of
the reasons i find is
that speech
in a physical space lasts
only as long as youre speaking
but once it is uploaded onto
the internet on any platform
it is there forever
and then your attackers or
you know whoever opposes you
they gather
and then they spread it further
and more and more
people join that group
of people who are attacking and
it takes on a life of its own
chattering
deibert were going through
a demographic revolution
the center of gravity
of cyberspace is shifting
right before our eyes
from the north
and the west of the planet
where it was invented
to the south and the east
the vast majority of internet
users today and into the future
are coming
from the developing world
for whom these technologies
are empowering
what should we expect then from
these next billion digital users

midia ninja emerged
from this new digital culture
youtube and other
social media networks
facilitate a shift to
we are the media
the media is us
speaking portuguese
in english once we started
with midia ninja
and we went to the streets
and tried to do live streaming
there was a mobile station
with an electric generator
using gasoline you know
a 4g modem a laptop
a camera a video switcher and--
-imitating vibrating machine
-synthesized music
it was impossible to
push a 00-pound cart
with a potential bomb
between your knees
silva it was good
in the first two or three times
in more calm demonstrations
i remember
there was a discussion
and then carioca said
no i found an app
its name is twitcasting
and maybe we can try it
electropop
it was a japanese free app
used by teenagers to hang out
you know
in portuguese
it was a low-quality image
but it could be transmitted
nonstop
that why twitcasting
was perfect
chantingspeaks portuguese
it a very delicate moment here
in the saens peña square
people being prohibited
from walking to
or to leave the square
this image we are seeing here
a corridor of police
encircling the protest
singing in portugueseindistinct
looking at brazil
this is one of those cases
where you have
a sporting event in this case
which triggers all sorts of
extra concern around security
and the control of information
much of it legitimate
but what often happens is that
the layering of surveillance
extra-legal measures that
happens leading up to
and during these events
doesnt just disappear
it becomes part of
the permanent architecture
chanting in portuguese
can you tell me
what this is
no i cantwhy not
it transmits live video
to the central command
that all i know
about this equipment

deibert
mobile phones are prevalent
everyone has one in their hands
and the police
now use a technique
where they set up fake
cell phone towers that captures
everyone within the vicinity
and gathers up
identifying information that
emitted by the cell phones
which they then
use to track people
and associate them
with each other
and being at specific
physical events like a protest
and the government
can go back in time
and recreate
every facet of your life
on that particular day and hour
with whom
you were communicating
not only
what youre broadcasting
but what youre saying privately
and use this to incriminate you
down the road
in portuguese
nineteen people accused
of planning acts of vandalism
were arrested today in rio
woman it was just dawn
when 30 police left to serve search and seizure warrants in rio
they confiscated computers cell phones
gas masks and one piece of wood with nails and other objects
inside the police station here
there a new operational unit
which is
the internet crimes unit
they attempt to transform
our youth who want to see
a different country
into a gang
of marginalized criminals
surveillance of the internet
mobile phones
manipulation of evidence
they are monitored
phone-tapped and followed
including the ninjas
you can be sure their phones
are all tapped
that includes us as well
this surveillance
this espionage
this paranoia
that been imposed
people realize there
some hidden mechanism of power
going on through surveillance
and you begin to suspect maybe
this device you cant trust
maybe the state in here
or it in my mobile phone or
and as that kind of
seeps out there
people become much more
unwilling to take risks
you know even in our own work
were much more cautious
about what we say over e-mail
worried that
somebody listening and so on
it like sand in the machinery
it kind of slows things down
and everything becomes
much more complicated
just to communicate
basic instructions
youre like oh
first i have to encrypt it
all these technologies too
cryptography things
they might be getting cheap
but if we consider
in terms of time
they are expensive
you know
people are being murdered
every day in the favelas
the military police
are still running
so it complicated now
to stop the machines
and adapt our system
to a more safe mode
crowd booing
in portuguese these days
the media can police more
than the police themselves
by reproducing this idea
of the protester as enemy
the truth is tough to swallow
globo supported
the dictatorship
bentes history of o globo
started during
the military dictatorship
it was the media arm
of the dictatorship
and they think
theyre as powerful
as the government
we say if you hate the media
then become the media
oh my oh  ill go for what you know
who i owe  why own when you can just
sell it
in portuguese
weve just had many bombs
explode
there were many aggressions
we just witnessed
many rubber bullets shot
one on top of the other
as soon as the bomb exploded
the arbitrariness commenced
the physical aggressions
during searches
no one is being aggressive
no you are talking smack
-no one was
physically aggressive here
-let me report what ive seen
youve already unleashed
such a shitload of violence
and youre not going to
revoke my right
to free expression
my right to do my job
as the free media
the media activist that i am
my name is felipe pecanha
if you want to know
man
those gloves  just take em off
move before  the city moves to us
there behind me yet another
situation of pandemonium
people screaming
to us to us

-horns playing

what are they doing downstairs
i got beat up down there
woman open open
what happening
in therethey are beating up everyone
dont touch me
sit down
did they beat you
yes a lot
i was trying to protect myself
the police have no shame
no shame committing
these savage acts
whoa dont take me
whoa brother
what going on
theyre arresting me
theyre kicking me
theyre kicking me
theyre crushing my phone
what is this
i was just attacked by
eight of you ten of you
big armed men in uniform
i didnt do anything wrong
to any of you
i am transmitting live
on the internet
with a cell phone
this is not
any kind of violence
this is not a crime
this is a constitutional right
of the citizen
the military police here in rio
are a disgrace
crowd applauding
deibert
so at the same time
that you have so many people
able to communicate to
a global audience at an instant
governments in ways that
they werent 20 years ago
are really ramping up
information controls
because they see
and when we say governments
were really talking about
entrenched powers
institutionalized uh you know
forms of capitalism in the state
that see you know
this type of
unpredictable citizen activism
as a threat to their interests
and are developing ways
to counter it
announcer you have new challenges today
sensitive data is transmitted over encrypted channels
you need more
you want to look through your target eyes
you have to hack your target
you have to overcome encryption and capture relevant data
being stealth and untraceable
exactly what we do
the vendors of
these products and services
market them to governments
usually at trade shows
that are only open
to accredited law enforcement
and intelligence agencies
actually ive got
a big binder that i can
so if you ignore the bag
actually which
chuckling
someone uh deposited
these in as a gift to me
but i think
was hoping to disguise it
in the kindergarten bag
these are brochures
from the type of trade shows
that were talking about
products and services that allow
cell phone detection
uh insertion of malware
tracking
social media monitoring
in many ways the way to
think about this market
is that it
the commercialization
of cyber crime
you trick somebody into
installing a software program
that contains malicious code
that exploits some vulnerability
in the system
which then allows the attacker
to do anything they want
turn on the webcam
listen in on the microphone
record keystrokes
record the location
the movement
it operates without
much accountability
certainly no corporate
social responsibility
ripe for abuse in a place
like sudan or ethiopia
weve seen in one
case after another
how this ends up being used
to target civil society
aha
gamma group
maker of the notorious
finfisher spyware
cars honking
the whole history
my personal history
my family history
and my organization history
is written with surveillance
in ethiopia
there is only one server
every telecommunication
connection
passes through
the ethiopian
telecommunications server
and that server is
highly controlled
when you talk to a friend
you know that somebody
is hearing
when you write an e-mail
you suspect that somebody
might have read it
and that somebody
wants to hunt you down
and when i came to the uk
there was a total liberation
of that stress
i felt
i am living in a free country
where the privacy of individuals
is respected
and my privacy is
also respected
but i was wrong
sometime in 203
we started to find
some of the things that we
discussed among a small circle
in open media
and in unfriendly medias
of the ethiopian government
you dont want to
suspect your friend
but you have to
and we keep on wondering
how they could find out
we got the answer
from a totally unexpected area
a certain group of people
goes to citizen lab
and they published a report
and in that report
there was my photograph
and they used it
to attach with the spyware
and distribute it
among the ethiopian community
the attacker has to socially
engineer or convince the target
to open a file or to
you know click through
some security warning
um in order to become infected
we had found a document
that had pictures of ethiopian
opposition leaders in it
and it looked like
it was targeted
and designed to appeal
to members of
the ethiopian diaspora
uh but in fact
the file was cleverly disguised
to look like a document
that actually
a computer program
an executable file
so when you run this
it will install software
on your computer
even though you know they
changed the icon and everything
to make it look like
this is a document
or a picture
this is actually a program
after that
i just tried to scan
people who were arrested
after my departure
i had a friend in saudi arabia
who was sent back to ethiopia
and arrested and
sentenced to 8 years
and i started to question
probably it was because of me
and he not the only person
i was able to look at the memory
of an infected computer
in other words
what going on inside
the computer when it infected
and i was able to identify
several interesting artifacts
in the memory
including a bunch of strings
that said finfisher finspy
very clearly attributing this
to the company
ethiopia is
one of the poorest countries
in the world
internet users in ethiopia
are less than two percent
it is the lowest in the world
but they spend
millions of dollars
for finfisher
for spying on people like me
who are trying to do
to bring a better future
to ethiopia
you dont have to be the nsa to
get inside somebody computer
um instead you can
exploit their curiosity
their um need to communicate
and of course
journalists at the very heart
of what they do
is engage in communication
with a lot of people
and a lot of people that
they dont know and trust
necessarily
because theyre engaged
in outreach and communicating
constantly with sources
crowd shouting
cheering whistling
fifty years ago
nobody would have known
what happened in syria
but in 20 when it started
everybody had facebook
everybody has e-mails
and everybody has whatsapp
and viber
so you just cant stop people
from telling
what is happening to them
so when they besieged daraa
at the beginning
they shut down communication
internet land lines
and even electricity
but they did not know that
in the 2st century
people have their ways
people were charging
their mobiles from their cars
or generators
hand generators
um manual generators
and people were using
satellite connections
you dont need to use
the country uh internet
to be connected to the internet
you can use anything
and they were able to tell
what was happening to them
um so the story got around
man speaking foreign language
sirens blaring
a few years ago many of us
celebrated the arab spring
as the paradigm of what
these technologies could do
remember
we called it at the time
liberation technology
it would bring about the end
of authoritarian rule
man speaking arabic
unfortunately
syria has become the
arab spring dark aftermath
explosion
boy shouting in arabic
as groups
sympathetic to the assad regime
have employed
off-the-shelf malware crime kits
to infiltrate social networks
arrest torture and
murder opposition groups
and even target
their air strikes
rifles cocking
shouting
gunshot
man from the beginning
we believed that the camera
is the most powerful weapon
and it was actually
the only weapon we have
to deliver our own message
to the whole world
this is interesting
baraa
speaking arabic
it a pleasure for me
to introduce
one of my best friends
mr baraa
he one of the most activist
people inside syria
he came a few days ago
cause he has
he has many broken
bones on his body
gunfire
he was there and covered
the battle in daraa city
and in the afternoon
they get a tank shell
explosion
he was with his friend
whom has this camera
and that good guy you know
he gets killed
by one tank shell
from the regime side
gunfire
this video you will see now
a remote control car and
it exploded a huge explosion
it was filmed
by this camera
explosion
after that
the rocket launchers
started to hit the place
from the regime side
so our activist this media guy
he gets killed in here
in this exact this place
now here
he was standing here
and people found
the camera with him
we took out the memory card
and we post this
as you know
in memory of hussain
wreckage clattering
so now mr baraa here
just a few days just to heal
he paid a visit
to some hospitals
to check out himself
then he will go back into syria
to keep working
there is a war on facebook
uh every side is using facebook
to promote themselves
they say on facebook
that the army now controls
a certain area
so the rebels all go to that
certain area even though
it still rebel-controlled
they start bombing it even
though it under their control
then they withdraw from it
the other way around
the regime will say
we will occupy this area
we will take over this area
then the fsa would leave because
theyre afraid of bombardment
it just a game
facebook is a game
wjd
it was just a silly joke i made
i didnt hurt anybody
i didnt insult anyone
it was not political
it was not racist
there is nothing
that they could hold against me
with a thing that
i wrote on facebook
but still
at a time of war
people get crazy
they did not drag me
in the street or kidnap me
they just asked me to come
to ask me a few questions
this is what they said
so i signed the paper
that im coming
i went
the next morning at 30
to the detention center
the security guy came to me
he like
he like half of my height
he blindfolded me
and i was like
i was okay with that
because i thought it some
it confidential secrets
of the country
that they dont want me to see
and then i was presented
to the detective
or the interrogator
i never saw him
he told me
youre a computer engineer
please be seated
and i sat next to him
and he started reading
all my facebook posts
i was like oh
one of the posts
that i wrote was
no praying no fasting
until the regime falls
which was actually
making fun of both sides
and i laughed and he like
im not kidding with you
im not joking with you
he kicked me on my chest
and then he requested
the same short guy
because he was
there in the room
to bring something called
the flying carpet
which is a torturing machine
it a wooden board
like the door
but it has joints in the middle
that can flip
and i had to lay on it
they tied my wrists and
they tied me from the middle
they tied my legs
and they just closed it
so my knees touched my chest
he took off my shoes
and my socks
and started beating me
with a metal
uh with a metal whip
the pain is unbelievable
you just cant take it anymore
you just cant endure
this amount of agony
what we saw in syria
was a lot of use of say
off-the-shelf remote access
tools
so this is sort of software
that you can get from
underground message boards
or maybe purchased
for not so much money
maybe $200-300 that
give you the ability
to record someone keystrokes
read their e-mails
even look at them
through their webcam
record via
the computer microphone
conversations that are being had
around the target computer
frequently what you would see
is it would be bundled
with some type of lured document
which showed
a deep understanding
of the psychology of the people
they were trying to target
for instance one of
the documents that was sent out
that i keenly recall
was a list
a purported list
of insurgents identified
by the syrian government
so of course what happened was
that this was promptly passed
around
to all sorts of very
interesting groups in syria
because everyone wanted to know
if they were on this list
or not
so the actual spyware
payload itself wasnt
particularly sophisticated
but the social
the social
and social engineering side
of that operation
um was quite smart
internet entered almost
all countries in the region
before it entered syria
yes
government in syria
we are not as developed
as canada for example
or not as developed
as united states
in canada
they can monitor people
and control people
and spy people in
a very intelligent way
and even they dont
feel that they are
spied on
but in syria
of course you go to old ways
they untie me and then i was
and then he asked me to
sit next to him and he said
let start talking
and i told him
i dont want to
talk to you anymore
he said i want you
to admit you work with the free
syrian electronic army
i was like
i dont know what that is
he said you like their page
you like their page
on facebook
i told him
i like their page on facebook
but there are too many pages
on facebook that you can like
i also like assad page
on facebook
well that did not convince him
so his boss came
and he told him
what is going on
he told him
this is the facebook guy
and he not cooperating
so then his boss told him to
send him down to the basement
peel his skin off and just
remind me of him after a month
and i was like can we go
back to the flying carpet
chuckles
i stayed there
for almost a month
and then i was released
with a presidential amnesty
so i went in a taxi
covered with dust
dirt shit and blood
all over my face
my clothes
and then the taxi driver
felt pity for me
and he gave me a cigarette
i remember
that was the first time i cried
and i went to my flat in latakia
where i used to study
and my roommates
were shocked
to see me alive
and then like
two weeks after that
i fled the country
i came to jordan
i am a journalist now
man with syria
a lot of the bad things
that are happening
are happening to people
who dont look
like westerners
the bad things happening to
these people through technology
through the risks
inherent in technology
are not different
than the kinds of risks
that we may face
um although they look
different
we see in the news
almost every day
a report of a breach
some kind of a large hack
data being exploited somewhere
it the same problem
but in syria
it looks very different
and because there are
dark skinned people
uh and there are guns
and a foreign language
it feels i think to many
exotic and different
and it couldnt happen here
and i think in fact
what youre seeing in syria
is this is what happens
when the risks get higher
but the technology is the same
theyre using the same facebook
that we are
chattering
in portuguese
my name is bruno
for those who dont know me
man beat boxing
id been attending protests
for a month
a month full of protests
it good to have protection
in case police repression
is very strong
when the professor asked
the class what they thought
people were
against the protestors
i improvised a chest protector
with aluminum
i said whoa you didnt
even go to the protests
it not like you describe it
so i decided to make a video
to document a protest
for those who didnt attend
chattering
im arriving now
at largo do machado
woman shouting in portuguese
lot of different people here
singing in foreign language
shouting on microphone
man shouting in portuguese
they have shut down
all the lights
to intimidate the crowd
but were not going to leave
only when the people become one
and not two peoples
where the rich
use the poor against the poor
because we are strong
we are not weak
upbeat intro
satisfied
satisfied
satisfied
gunshot
man singing
glass shattering
all shouting
screaming
sirens chirping
teles i hadnt done anything
but police pursued me
im a pacifist
i dont like violence
but ill defend myself
if i have to so i ran
woman speaking portuguese
what is this this is surreal
singing continues
clapping rhythmically
singing continues indistinct
satisfied
shouting
shouting in portuguese
-shouting
-shutters clicking
news intro
in portuguese
the protest took place
outside
the governor palace
it started peacefully
but ended in confrontation
man a battle began on one side rocks being thrown
on the other side rubber bullets
the masked bandits threw molotov cocktails at the police
one policeman was hit by the fire
the military police found a bag with molotov cocktails
-police officer
you should film this
-reporter what is it
molotov cocktails
these kill cops
shouting
he threw the first
molotov cocktail he threw
the first molotov cocktail
i wasnt even there
i wasnt carrying a backpack
someone attacked me
dont say anything else
my friend
sirens wailing
shouting
in english
lots of people were there
by 700 in the night
and we were live
carioca we are here
transmitting live to 5000
viewers with a mobile phone
silva
suddenly a man came to carioca
and he asked to interview him
carioca
whoa can i speak here
what is this
silva and then
the military police came
to carioca searched his bag
and then they said
he should be taken to jail
as a preventive arrestment
to be searched and inquired
carioca
theyre taking me away
i dont have anything in my bag
how this information
was being virilized
was really amazing
like sharing sharing sharing
tweets tweets tweets
mention mention mention
the ninja is being arrested
and suddenly there was
like a small crowd
like 5000 people
and all of them was
screaming together
in portuguese
hey police
where is the midia ninja
chanting hey police
where is the midia ninja
at the police station
there were some lawyers
to help us some activists
that where i met bruno teles
man speaking in portuguese
woman speaking portuguese
-what your name
-my name is
bruno ferreira teles
teles
the midia ninjas appeared
right when i needed to speak
they gave me a voice
they asked me if i wanted
to give them an interview
i said i want to i need to
as we interviewed bruno
globo broadcast that
he threw the molotov
and had been arrested
it was bruno ferreira
who was caught with a backpack
full of molotov cocktails
the police officer who was hit
with the molotov cocktail
suffered burns to the thorax
the big media in general
were all against me
they associated me
with vandalism
with violence
shouting
i want to ask you
to help me to find the video
of the moment
where i ran from police
they took me in
and they are saying
i was there with bottles
of molotov cocktails
and i was not
that all im asking
that you search out these videos
and collaborate
silva in english
then we posted this video from
the mobile like real time
and it virilized very fast
carioca in portuguese
our in-box exploded
5000 e-mails in 24 hours
a ton of images and video
that showed bruno innocence
glass shattering
vocalizing
video sound distorted
vocalizing continues
glass shattering
woman what is this people
this is surreal
woman vocalizing
vocalizing
shouting
music distorting
gunshot muffled
electrical crackling
crackling continues
the video was just getting
bigger in the social media
bruno teles became a character
crowd shouting
within a day
globo reversed their position
they said i was a student
a good kid
everyone likes him
contrary to information
released by the military
and civil police
the student bruno teles
did not possess explosives
at the time of his arrest
silva they said
that bruno was innocent
and they used midia ninja image
and they credited midia ninja
it was the first
time that we were seeing
globo recognizing
a free media collective
as a legitimate player
in the communication game
it was a next step
crowd shouting
gunshot
explosion
glass shattering
woman
oh he changing his shirt
shouting
woman vocalizing
orlando
this is an old strategy
when police infiltrate groups
and appear as activists
they legitimize
the police violence
explosion
for the population
if the protestors
are launching explosions
the police must do
whatever is necessary
even on the margins of the law
bentes
the best form of security today
is to live stream everything
if everyone knows where you are
then youre safe
the french word surveillance
implies watching from above
in this case sub-veillance
is more accurate
bottom-up the crowd
surveils from all angles
crowd chanting in portuguese
hey undercover cops
go fuck yourself
are you an undercover copim a protestor idiot
shouting continues
crowd booing
it took only
the time for the video
to circulate online and on tv
then habeas corpus was filed
and he was released
woman bruno come here
woman crying
orlando
what if we didnt have
these images
shouting
how many others
dont have the good fortune
of being filmed
crowd chanting
ninja ninja ninja
ten people are still inside
some of them ninjas
crowd repeating
and we will not leave
crowd repeating
until they are all released
cheering
crowd ninja
crowd chanting
digital pop music playing
ive always been a fan
of the terms hacking
and hacktivism
especially hacktivism
which is the combination of
hacking and political activism
and those combined
are pretty powerful to me
it about encouraging people
not to accept technology
at face value
we need to encourage people
to think about
what it is that surrounds them
to question authority
in a sense of the authority
being the technological
environment around them
and to realize that
when you start pulling back
the layers of all of this
that where
the exercise of power is
so if we want liberal democracy
to flourish
we need people
to start lifting back the layers
and understanding
what going on
clicking
snowden i think ultimately
it comes down to understanding
what your values are
because how do you
develop your thoughts right
how do you determine
what it is that
you truly believe
how do you determine what
it is you really want to say
if you cant even
keep notes safely
if you cant
have some private space
some space for thought
some space to enjoy the product
of your own intellect
to share that with people
close to you who you trust
whether theyre family
whether theyre colleagues
whether theyre compatriots
deibert one thing
that i see a lot is this idea
of technology as a solution
it a natural thing
okay technology
is under threat
let find
a technological solution
there are so many projects now
around secure communications
platforms chats
instant messaging
but it only one component
of a solution set
and i think often overlooked
are the legal and political
dimensions
if were talking about
protecting and preserving
all of this
as a secure and open
communication space
that means holding governments
accountable
it means holding
companies accountable
putting in place rules and laws
that ensures they cant
do things that infringe
on our freedoms and rights
that to me is uh
such a critical foundation
of a digital democracy today

joseph what happened in this house
uh jude why dont you go
show brahms the music room
stay close mate
there was a family
that lived here a long time ago
had a son
went a bit mad
killed a little girl
got burnt up in fire
wore a mask to hide it
lived inside the walls
of the house for 30 years
never came out
the heelshires
yeah the heelshires
and
and the parents committed suicide
drowned themselves
it a very sad story
and the son
well it all got a bit messy
after the parents had gone
he killed a man very nearly two others
before he was killed himself
but theyre all dead and buried now
what the son name
his name was brahms
did you say brahms
im sorry
i didnt mean to keep it from you
i just didnt think itd ever come up
thank you for telling us
come on jude
it time to go home
hey joseph
did you ever find your dog

im afraid oz was found
gutted in the forest
im sorry to hear that
so your parents fell me
youve been talking again
is this your new friend brahms
he seems like a very nice friend
what are some of the things
you talk about
he tells me all sorts of things
sometimes he tells me about
the other families he lived with
oh has he lived with a lot of families
he wants to live with us now
he was very angry that mommy and daddy
wanted to take him away
oh and when brahms gets angry
does he say he wants fo
hurt someone or something
is there something
he wants to tell your mum and dad
well if jude had something fo do
with the dog death
then this is a lof more serious
than we thought
the doll might be enabling him
fo shift blame
for all the bad things that he might do
i think it would be a good idea
for me fo see him face-to-face
when do you think
you can bring him down to london
weve got guests coming today
but well bring him as soon as we can
all right then
but i urge you keep a close eye on him

you asked me why im here
it the same reason that you are
he called me
he calls out to the ones that need him
the damaged ones
he looks inside you
it was just a whisper
at first
when i first came here
so quiet
and he was in pieces when i found him
broken
and then the voice said
lo put him back together
so i did
then i heard him growing inside
you must have heard it
jude sure has
oh yeah
i dont know what brahms is
but you can stop this
it too late
brahms and jude are gonna be one
and itll be beautiful
everybody thought that i was crazy
they thought the heelshires
were crazy but no
it always been the doll
even before the house
before the davies the ones before that
i found all their old letters
he knew that you were coming
he knew your boy would find him
that why he told me to bury him

brown girl in the ring
woman
my people lived in peace
on the mainland of toronto
until 2030 the year
i was born
the wealthy stole toronto
for themselves
screaming
riots erupted
police radio chatter
whistle blows
the new regime built a wall
barring us from the mainland
police sirens wailing
they exiled my people
to a forsaken island off
the coast of toronto
wind blows eerily
our spirits hunger for a home
an evil sorcerer rudy rose up
from the aches of the burn
using buff
and creating crack to rule us
whip cracking
my grandmother a priestess
called on the spirit
mama ache to heal the burn
sings in foreign language
mama ache
she is light
continues singing
she is love
singing continues
with her help
we grew
‐but crack silenced mama ache
‐whip cracking
so mami called on papa legba
the destroyer
shouting and screaming
papa legba
demanded a young priestess
as a conduit for his power
i watched
as my mother tried to
open to papa legba
crying
open to me
mami
dont be afraid
ah
ah
let papa legba power in
or the fear will kill you
ah

﻿
episode 5 were almost home
the guys are halfway through the
european run
in addition to a lingering
sense of fatigue
each day seems to bring
its own set of logistical challenges
yea where are we pushing it
streets are small parking is
non-existent
so we detached the trailer in the middle
of the road and pushed it over here
now were waiting for a van to put all the
gear in so we can take it across the street
so we can set up which is supposed
to start an hour and a half ago
everything pretty straightforward
on the us headline run
here it just who knows there a
lot more variables a lot more unknowns
every day it like kinda figuring out
figuring out a lot more things on the fly
we are in some dirty-ass loading dock in
manchester uk
we entered some kind of time-warp
that made us fucking six hours late
we should have been here a long
time ago but holger stopped
and everybody was asleep and
everybody slept through it
he seriously stopped at a truck stop
for five hours
and didnt empty the piss tank
and then get to the venue and
empties it all over the fucking street
ill run down maybe have to
pull it down from downstairs
im washing my underwear in the venue
because we havent seen the laundry
for days and im out of clean clothes
and this is rock n roll
what is it is it tuesday night
is that what it is
who gives a fuck
were in islington and weve been
discussing the election of
kaiser orange the 2nd
the guy won the presidency
that really fuckin happened
we should literally tweet egomaniac all day
like once
on the hour just do hashtag egomaniac
yeah it been an exciting fucking 24 hours
just watching the world
possibly come to an end
or not or who knows
it a great great time to be a nihilist
this european run consists of 4 shows
in 8 days but that doesnt mean they
have four days off any day without a
performance is scheduled because the
next gig is just too far away to make it
there in time to perform
the guys take in the sights as they can
but most off days are typically spent
nearly entirely on a bus
van train or airplane
so were in glasgow scotland michael
hometown mic hometown which is cool
in this land where i can say what the fuck
i want and people understand me
*speaking scottish*
i flew in a day before yeah to catch up
with family and my best friend
so i caught with her and my other cousin and
my mum and my aunt so that was really nice
this is my mum
you alright
this town was the fuckin
spearhead of the industrial revolution
the 70 was fuckin terrible
rife gangland violence in glasgow man
you ever heard of the ice --cream wars
yeah that was pretty fucking bad too
cameraman doesnt sound bad
they werent fighting with ice-cream
jason does this look like
something that important
yeah it used to be an old cinema here
and it used to be a circus before that
when they were excavating
prospecthill up the road
they found elephant bones and
they got a fuckin archeological team in
to fuckin
there was elephants in scotland
no there was a circus at the abc
and when the elephant died they just buried
it up the road and didnt tell anybody
geron how long is mic going to
talk about the history of scotland
until i finish wiring this fuckin plug
dick
thank you for calling advantage customer
service were closed at this time
our normal hours are 8am to 7pm
that the second time that happened
to me i cant figure out the time zones
what time is it
okay scotland
i fell asleep
to be awoken by a large bang
bam bam and i fucking see out of the
corner of my i like stuff flying
as the bus driver was fleeing the
scene of the crime so to speak
actually not so to speak
that exactly what he did
and we didnt stop we just kept going
yeah i dont know why but im
in a shit mood today though
just in a fucking shitty mood
yea everyone fucking sick of it
im kinda nervous cause
we have like 2 weeks left and
like everyday is just
exponentially getting greater
my disdain for this trip
and i want to just get
home as quick as possible
and everyone feels like that
like band and crew the shows are great
everything great were just fucking sick of it
let have a great a great
show
deep in the heart of a long tour
run patience frays
and otherwise charming quirks
of travel begin to wear you out
ahh another gig
a good touring family expects this and
works together to keep spiri ts high
and maintain a sense of humor even
through the exhaustion and monotony
yup i remember when that happened
the guy say goodbye to the bus and
head out for three fly gigs in russia
and ukraine two markets theyve been
looking forward to playing for a long
time however the band draw in those
countries is completely unknown
we are in cologne germany
no were not were in dusseldorf
oh yes we are in dusseldorf germany we were in
cologne we went to sleep and we woke up in dusseldorf
were flying to st petersburg
moscow and then ukraine playing kiev
yeah it pretty exciting there a few places
where you actually legitimately did not expect to
end up playing shows in when you first
join a band
you interpret what i say into russian
actually im very excited to go to russia a little
nervous because of the election that been going on
but seems like translating in russian
im always going to talk over you
so you just have to keep going
im pretty fucking excited to be here i
wasnt expecting all this snow i mean i know
it russia but it only november
how cold is it
fuck you cold
okay so id like to make a toast but in
the russian tradition zakuski
you should take a shot and then follow it
up instead of a lime like tequila you put a
little piece of garlic or pickle
or this garlic bread
it very exciting were in like a
traditional russian restaurant
on our first night here it pretty cool
thanks so much for bringing me on this week
and ill do my best to stay out of trouble
were in st petersburg walking to the
hotel just had a great russian meal
were about to pass a little grocery
store a sex club a sex shop
and then our hotel
let see if we make any detours cut
where are we jesse
am i covered in snow
you are yeah
were on a bridge in st petersburg
i wore the wrong jacket
i didnt realize it was snowing out
but yeah it quite a sight
were having fun with electricity today
see that that side fucked
*teaching russian pronunciation of st
petersburg*
go click on her profile picture
jesus geron look at that girl dude
go to alexandra again
she has a marry now
button on her profile
holy shit geron
i love russia russia great
*teach russian*
you literally just say kak
just like cock
ok cock
*speaking russian*
did you get all that
ticket price venue location night of the
week or a conflicting sporting event can
mean the difference between selling out
a venue and playing to a half full room
as they play their first shows ever in
russia and the ukraine they are
optimistic but do not know quite what to
expect
jason there more
people here than germany
geron are there
geron yeah probably
geron germany
jason cologne
jason last show two days ago
geron i dont remember that oh yeah
yo mo
that was a top 0 crowd
nostrovia
you totally killed it
sorry im like sweating like monkey
so hot in there oh my god
it about 600 in the
morning i think
were leaving going to the
ukraine to play a show in kiev
how much sleep did you get
uh 3 hours
about the third show in a row
today been a long day
watching these guys load
the gear is very tiring
the show in kiev was also a hit but the
guys only have a few moments to reflect
on success in russia and ukraine before
having to pack up and move along once again
it midnight we are loading
the luggage room with gear
we have to unload it at 530am tomorrow
and fly to barcelona
the last 3 shows in europe are in spain another
new market for them with an unknown fanbase
they also remain in limbo with their
record label back home
so what our actual plan
weve not heard back from the guy
theyre saying go hard at radio
weve not communicated with our radio
team they apparently have gone to radio
whatever that means
if we dont hear from them today or tomorrowa
full week after writing a letter like that
then that not only a week
that a month 5 6 weeks after um
saying we want off the label and we
still havent heard anything from them
how do we give this song a
shot because i actually believe in it
well we dont have an another option you
cant force people to do shit when youre
halfway across the world
weve got the single going to radio were hoping
for some good data in the next holiday period
if that doesnt happen it dead
it one thing to say no let go big let
go to radio hard but what the fuck does that
mean after theyve killed a campaign and
were going back six weeks later to the
same pd asking them to play the same
song that we just pulled away
from so it one thing to say that but
it can potentially harm us going big if
there not an actual strategy and plan
im tired
talk about divide and conquer theyre
actually doing that to us by turning
this entire thing negative
they have killed music for us
is this a 00 watt one
yea i mean let do a bassman for the wet i
mean yeah bassman for wet and this guy for dry
they have a shitload of amps
that arealmost right
despite a number of presale
tickets sold 5 minutes to showtime
the crowd is surprisingly sparse
the thing here the people wait until
more or less the end to grab some
beers outside because it cheaper
to get some food outside
because it cheaper too
jason then they show up
we have to do it dude there whatever 30
peopleturn that into 50 or 60 the next time
by the time im 45 im gonna have this
career off the ground dude
dude your funny bone
id hit that
right on cue the crowd showed
up as the band took the stage
that was definitely that was most
improved from expectations to actuality
i was expecting the worst show of the tour
mvp
it may still be the worst show of the
tour but it was still pretty good
the band has one more show in the
coastal town of santander before the
final show of the tour in madrid
camera hey mo
mo fuck off
camera how your day going
hey danny
camera fucking creepy his eyes are open
danny
is he ok hi
danny were doing soundcheck
danny oh my im fucking tired
although santander was one of the
smallest cities they played
the show provided one of the most memorable
moments of the tour
i think everybody faces last night was
a fucking gem to be honest with you
the band played the show it was great they
decided they werent going to play the encore
so they said play the house music
we turned the house music on
we brought the lights up in the room
and the crowd just wouldnt shut up
they wouldnt leave
there only 60 70 people here but they
were going bananas for them
jesse guys come back
they had to come back out again
honestly the sooner i get off
that fucking bus the better
camera are you excited to go home
yes very very excited to go home
when was the last time you were home
i cant remember
i think this tour was absolutely worth
it you know we lost a lot of money on it
a lot of fucking money
overall it was probably worth the
money that we spent to come here
you know very small shows but i think we
actually started something here
a base for us to come back to
particularly in eastern
europe russia poland
hey danny uh is he in here
oh hi hey go through dylan space and
go downstage to your position or
else youre going to be really fucked
jason we get to go home
jason last one
danny forever
jason no no just for a week or two
good morningit not morning if you
dont go to sleep yet
camera what time is it
5am
it sunday the 20th of november we are
going home
after four months on the road playing
60 shows in 30 states and 0 countries
the guy head back to the
us to close out the year
with two more weeks of
playing radio festivals
but with no single on the radio the future
of the album remains unclear
next time on bus call
we are at our south african
childhood home in johannesburg
well be working but at the same time were
gonna try to show the crew a really good time
its oppikoppi day
three days of just
people losing their minds

i a beautiful
sunny afternoon
here in the cowboy state
weve got partly cloudy skies
clearing by sundown
and for you stargazers tonight
the geminid meteor shower
is set to put on
a once-in-a-lifetime show
between 600 pm and 200 am
so set your sights to the
north-northeast high in the sky
the national weather
service says temps
could dip into the mid-60s
so you have a beautiful night
to sit out with a sweetheart
kick back and put
something on the grill
and her a fun fact from
wyoming meteor research center
at hopkin air force base
only twice in
the showe history
have we seen a shower lasting
longer than two hours
and this one goes late
late into the night
so it sounds like i
going to be quite a show
dont go to bed early
and i didt know this but our
weather guy is saying to me
that these falling stars
are actually debris from
an asteroid that orbits the sun
every year-and-a half
i named how do you
pronounce this
fay-eh-thoon
phaethon is that it
sounds close enough
so we wot be able
to see that tonight but
plenty of shooting stars will
be dancing across the sky
keep it cool keep it fun
keep it safe
definitely be ready
for a fireworks display
from mother nature to go
with your rock n roll
currently 68 degrees and a
jam-packed line-up at kyos
what began as excitement
has turned to concern
in rural wyoming this morning
reports have been flooding
in from norad
and the international
space station
of some unusual activity
related to a meteor shower
mostly-viewable
in the northern u s
observatories around the
world are coordinating efforts
to assure the meteor that
made ground late yesterday
was one isolated incident
mount wilson observatory
in southern california
is closely monitoring
a group of 58 meteors
they want to reassure the public
that there is at this point
no cause for alarm and that
they are keeping a close eye
on the shower as it intensifies
notches road notches road
let me know when you see it
stand by for more
breaking news and reports
here on kyos wyoming
next dirt road on the right
why do meteors always land
in the middle of nowhere
i hate those country roads
i think we are here
00 years m like
my great-grandfather
built that barn you know
i all i have
i all the money i have
let see what
we got here huh
well let go say hi
how you doing guys
hello hi hi
officer pritchard
nice to meet you
kurt
yeah at first i thought
it was a jet
from the air force base
that caught on fire
or maybe it was a missile
that flew out of control
but until we got your call
to shelter in place
this town was in a panic
yeah well
tha understandable
a meteor traveling
0 times the speed of sound
will frighten anybody
so are you the poor woman that
just got her house destroyed
yeah
uh yeah
she was pretty shook up
but she keeps mentioning
how happy she is
that you guys are located
just a couple miles up the road
yeah are you the folks
that study the uh ufos
uh no
we actually study meteors
meredith this
is dr kurt siegel
h from the base
h their lead meteorologist
tha for weather brian
actually wre
called meteorists
those weather people
claimed that cool name
unfortunately
so here we are
oh yeah
i mean this was my house
i just put
in fresh juniper bushes
that explosion
even fried my radio
so do you mind
if we go ahead
and take a closer
look at things
yeah feel free
i a sad sight come on
all right this way
watch your step
just got to go around here
there too much damage
on the other side
all right now
watch your step here
i kinda tricky
here
okay
all right
so it came from right over here
and crashed the top of my house
and landed right over there
go ahead
here watch yourself
watch it
all right
watch your step
watch yourself
look at that
well this doest make sense
what
the size of it
i way too big
why
what did you expect
about a fraction of this
tha about six foot
what do you think mara
if this was the size
of an actual missile
what would it do
well geminids travel what
20000 or 30000 miles an hour
tha right
okay
well even without a payload
a small icbm
would generate the force
equivalent to a ton of tnt
i mean this size
speed
this whole town should be gone
shit
how do you explain that doc
im not sure
the only plausible explanation
is that this meteor
was traveling
at a much slower speed than
it should have
wll need a second opinion
on this
i gotta make a call
hey gwen it siegel
yes m at that crash site
there are a few things
that just dont add up here
i think we could really
use your expertise
oh youre on your way
good
because i need you and beth
down here stat
to run some element profiles
i cant figure out
for the life of me
how this thing survived
the atmosphere
or if there will be more
wre gonna need to dig
into this thing
i hope you have
your field kit
okay see you in a minute
she asked if we could take
the helicopter to save time
and i told her
wre not breaking
transport protocol ever again
please dot tell me
you taught her
how to fly a helicopter
i had a heart attack
when i found out
you taught her
how to fly a jet
boy i wish i had
a chauffer to fly me around
in a helicopter
title heavy weapons analyst
but yeah i can
get people where they need to go
from time to time
especially if they wanna
blow stuff up
my apologies
to be fair i did teach gwen
the basics of flying an f-35
and i told her
the next time wre up
she can take the controls
so is michael coming with her
michael no
i just her and beth
there here
yeah
gwen i understand
your husban
a hot shot colonel
now at the base
but we do still need you in
the field from time to time
sorry im late
beth is with us today
beth good to see you
yeah so no im late
because i had to start
the spectral imaging process
i told you that
was unnecessary gwen
my predictive models call
this a meteor shower
yeah well we should
talk about that
yeah we should
you gotta take a look at this
okay
kurt did you happen
to see all those dead birds
in the drive in this morning
yeah tha not uncommon
in a meteor shower
yeah no
but it seemed different
gwen what is it
beth would you mind
giving us a moment
thanks
kurt im telling you
im concerned
about this meteor
cloud density
if four objects aggregated
from the center
it could indicate
something much larger
more dangerous that
affecting them
gwen i understand
youre being cautious
because of russia but i ran
a complete threat matrix
and everything looked fine
yeah but what
if we were wrong about
phaeton disappearance
in that solar storm
after that asteroid
last perihelion
it never came back out
from behind the sun
that was the biggest solar
shower in decades
unless we just cat see it
cant see it
gwen no
gwen come on
the crate this way
beth
so gwen beth
this is brian
and next to him is meredith
the unfortunate home owner
hey brian meredith this
is our lead astrophysicist
oh my god
gwen armstrong
i read all about you
in wired magazine
looks like you have a fan
oh god m so sorry
about what happened to those
poor people who got injured
in chelyabinsk russia
thank you
ive read every single
one of your books seriously
when i saw it happen on
tv after your prediction
i felt so sad you know
and it said that the us
got the coordinates
completely wrong
and by the time they warned the
russians it was just too late
was that you
were you the one who got the
coordinates completely wrong
that was me
im sorry
sorry that it happened
thank you
thank you for your kind words
hey brian meredith
can i borrow you guys
for a second
i want you to tell me all
about what you saw
when that meteor struck yeah
hey mara why dot
you go radio base
and tell them wll be here
about another hour
copy that
you okay
yeah
i just want to get this sample
but if m being
completely honest
this whole russia thing
is still haunting me
sorry
i dont mean to dump
all of this on you
i know yore here
just to learn
uh dr armstrong
mm-hm
i dont mean
to overstep my bounds
but for what it worth
your theories are taught
all over the world
your husband michael
just got promoted
for helping redesign
a nuclear launch system
and you get to work
with him every day
if i even had a fraction
of those things
id think my life
was pretty incredible
thank you for all of that
okay i time to focus
on the task at hand huh
all right
so i need you to put these on
i want you to monitor the meteor
cloud as i take the sample
ive never done this before
you said you want to work
in this industry right
absolutely
well right now we need
to make sure that
this meteor shower
isnt a meteor storm
or something more dangerous
okay put these on
ill walk you through it
okay so the first setting
is just your basic telescope
that you look
through the lens
the second rendering
closes the aperture
and gives you a
real vr rendering
from the pentagon database
in real time
here you go
try that on
oh wow
this is incredible
i like m standing
above earth orbit
yeah pretty cool
and the third setting
just freezes the frame
and gives you
an interactive model
but you dont need to worry
about that right now
what i need from you is
to tell me if you see
meteor dust in the center
of that meteor cloud or
if it something solid
like an object
oh it kind of just
looks like a blob
like it keeps shifting
and changing around
but i cant really focus on it
okay
well reach out your hand
and pull up the menu bar
on the right hand side
squeeze your wrist
and open it up okay
and what is the density in the
center of that meteor cloud
um six objects
per square mile
six
yes it says six
do you remember
how to do a process
yeah i can do that
okay okay
okay
there you go
hey gwen
wha the eta on that sample
uh 30 seconds
okay
i dont understand why
he keeps rushing you
maybe if hed given
you more time on
your spectral imaging
theory in russia
all of those people wouldt
have gotten hurt
no i had enough time
but your spectral
imaging theory revolutionized
the way we do things
in the industry i mean
do you remember
that asteroid
that we found off
the observatory in hawaii
yeah it was 40000 miles
off of earth
mm-hm
well we found it
because of kurt algorithms
h the best
at projecting algorithms
wha that process say
59% iron and 3% silicates
both iron and silicates
are fully crystallized
but if dr siegel
ran his algorithm tests
on something better
something worthwhile
like the braeburg effect
i dont think that
anton braeburg is someone
that you should want to
model your career after
h kind of a laughing stock of
the science community right now
okay
hey what the core
temperature
400 degrees
are you sure
yeah it says 400
um okay
wve got to take
another sample
that cat be right
hey gwen how we coming
on that sample
uh 30 seconds
what is that gwen
i a composite drill
i a a combination of a
diamond and a laser
it can cut through anything
wve got to get this back
to base immediately
you okay
yeah
hey guys
ams site just
reported meteor made ground fall
2 miles due south
we gotta go come on
we have to get to base now
this is much worse
than we thought
ill check in with nws
no
oh no
you okay
im fine im fine
just get us out of here go
get us out of here
where gwen
where gwen
gwen
gwen
come on
kurt
where did you get this car
owner got killed
by a meteorite
go go go
no
oh no
beth is back there
no beth
beth is back there
we gotta go back
beth is gone gwen
gwen beth is gone
leave her
damn it
there no signal
there no signal anywhere
mara what do you got
what do you know
last update i got
was one minute ago
meteor strike outside of dublin
this thin global
oh my god
do you have anything
no the network jammed
you know what
let me try the satellite radio
oh my god
reverse reverse
go back
go go go
go
good good good
mara
okay that was close
everybody take a breath
wre okay
we made it
okay you okay
yeah
guys if the ground fall
spans the entire hemisphere
there no way the pentagon got
off a full response no way
you know there
definitely gonna add
a level five nuke strike
for good measure
probably
well if theyve
already launched level five
then were too late
because those meteors
will detonate those nukes
long before ill reach
the asteroid
then well have nothing
left to destroy it
what about nasa jpl gss
theve had to have
seen something
no one can see it
i hidden inside
the meteor cloud remember
i the needle in a haystack
i know
hey we just need to get there
and we need to tell them
to stop a level five
stop a level five
there not gonna react to us
there gonna think were giving
flawed data because of russia
and if we need proof
we dot have it
so what are we gonna do
i dont know mara
this contradicts
my entire threat matrix
im at a loss
gwen help me out
okay first things
first okay
we have to make sure that
they launch the emod okay
the evacuations meteor shield
the ordinance and
the orbital drones okay
and then kurt you know what
i want you to take that this
flag the center of the mass
in the meteor cloud
mark it as an apb and
let all the departments know
at least thatll give
them a fighting chance
at least of iding it
i got it got it
okay good
okay keep driving
and level five
as far as level five
kur right
there not gonna delay
a threat response
and if we want them
to stop the launch then
the data needs
to come from somebody else
someone like michael
h now lieutenant colonel
and h got
nuclear defense clearances
yeah but even if the order
comes down from him
he still has to get vetted
by singh wh at base
yeah and singh not stupid
h gonna know that order
is coming from you gwen
not if he breaks
the chain of command
and goes straight
to the pentagon okay
there no vetting there no
agencies there no red tape
michael still blames
me for russia gwen
h gonna think your
breaking protocol
to save time for some
back intel i gave you
look we all know
whose fault russia was
it wasnt yours
i love him but today h
just gonna have to get over it
yeah well what if
michael unable to do it
well if he unable to do
it then you know what
im going to take
the spec rendering
straight to the colonel
straight to the
command room right at base
right
we have to stop
this launch okay
so just get us to the base
and ill get the proof
yes maam
wll get you there
michael
gwen
there a two-mile
wide asteroid hidden inside
this meteor storm
wve got approximately
two hours and 29 minutes
until it hits
any nuclear response needs to
be saved to strike the asteroid
gwen you know
i cant do that
colonel singh has to approve
any protocol changes
i mean i can
flag incoming threats
on the defense database system
but i need a commanding
officer to clear it
but none of the other agencies
can see the asteroid
michael this is the worst
case scenario
the only reason i know
i there is because
i was able to examine
this mornin meteorite
what is that
meteor debris
shouldnt be that big
it is
oh my gosh
i creating a dust cloud
keep going
keep driving
no no no no no
damn it
oh no
oh no
are you okay
wha going on
yeah yeah im okay
i just that our
vehicle stalled
meteor debris
choked out the engine
oh no
damn it
well let go fix it
okay
okay okay
what do you think it is
i the belt chain
belt chain
okay
gwen you gotta get
out of there right now
this meteor storm is escalating
the dod has already approved
a level five launch
and there gonna be a meteor
shower right in your area
get out
michael listen to me
i cant stop this nuke strike
but you can
defense protocols
are cleared
for rank lieutenant colonel
and above
okay call general ambrose
at the pentagon
and tell him it was
you who personally
identified this
as an asteroid
we have to save the nukes
for the asteroid
im not gonna lie
to a commanding officer
it ist a lie
i a mass inside a cloud
that you or anyone
can see easily on radar
it just hast been
ided as an asteroid yet
the observatories
cant tell what it is
and the dod isnt
listening to me
is this from some intel
that mara gave you
no michael
you can confirm it personally
i as if youve captured
the dimensions
through
spectral imaging okay
youre asking me to stop a
nuclear strike in mid-launch
wre gonna leave
the whole planet
vulnerable to
a meteor storm
if you launch that strike
this storm will detonate
every one of those nukes
before it reaches the asteroid
only use conventional weapons
on the meteors
the drones have plasma
cannons that can melt tanks
and the satellite missiles
well there bunker busters
and the meteor shield
is woven crystallized carbon
and if the nukes strike
in the upper atmosphere
wre talking fallout
on a global scale
at its current heading
the nukes will strike it
right outside the mesosphere
fallout will be high enough just
like any other nuclear test
gwen
i could go to prison
for the rest of my life
we both could
there no time
break the chain of command
okay
you have to stop this launch
michael you have to believe me
wha our mark
two hours 6 minutes
south-southwest
i love you
i love you
so yore a mechanic
tha nice
i got it
you got it
right
yeah come on
this just in the
geological society of america
is now weighing in on
the growing threat of what
is now being called a
meteor storm
reported gravitational anomalies
and impact zones
are stirring up
geologic activity
including hot zones of volcanic
activity in our national parks
carbon dioxide monoxide and
methane levels in the atmosphere
are spiking nationwide
this is beginning to impact
the wildlife in the area
with reported injuries
and deaths being seen
as far north as canada
the department of defense
is involved as well as the un
and nato in preparation for
a potential nuclear strike
on the meteor storm
standby by for
further instructions
from the emergency
broadcast system
and in the meantime
please remain indoors
wyoming
i just received a terminate
signal from you
hang on
im putting you on com
there had better be a
good reason for this
sir this is lieutenant
colonel michael armstrong sir
under colonel singh in wyoming
i have full confirmation
of an incoming neo
backed by radar gss
incoming coordinates outlined
by radar are as follows
tha id number 3200 phaeton
vector southwest sir
sir we need to stop level five
countdown immediately
and retain as a defense
against the asteroid
we did not copy lieutenant
repeat we did not copy
i repeat
we have an incoming neo
it will strike in t-minus
two hours 6 minutes sir
we are aware of the
meteor storm lieutenant
however your alarm regards
a global response
is this signed off
by colonel singh
colonel singh is
responding directly
to a situation
in the field sir
but i have direct orders
from the colonel
to terminate level five sir
lieutenant we have
all emods active
terminate level five sir
we are confirmed on
the meteor threat lieutenant
i re
abort le five sir
level five abort
do you copy general
we are initiat
nice of you to join us
lieutenant armstrong
apologies sir
it wot happen again
daniels what the status
on the meteor shower
incoming
vector 20 delta 909 kentucky
incoming
vector 99 epsilon 30
south dakota
washington confirms
drones are in place
meteor shield deployed
orbital missiles engaged
level five strike at
t minus three minutes
we have a terminate
switch active
on our global response sir
is this accurate
this phon dead
get me ambrose on the line
yes sir
this is gonna be a long
day daniels
armstrong what the status
on that phone
it is working on it sir
we should be back up
in a few minutes
we are still on track
for launch
nuclear response in t minus
2 minutes 30 seconds
even if we cat get in touch
with the pentagon
we are following our last
known orders
daniels check the targeting
array is still aligned
sir we have a
full system crash
in the western half of the us
colonel we just severed
our apparatus to the pentagon
our missile systems for the
whole region are failing
sir what did you do
lieutenant armstrong
step away from the com
and disarm now
private daniels get dod
back online
to initiate that
launch right now
sir all of our coms are down
our landline and
backup feed are down
lieutenant colonel armstrong
crashed the system sir
subdue him now
get the system back online
daniels get me communication
with the pentagon now
i our new
guidance system sir
armstrong cut off
half the country
and a meteor just struck our
bas satellite dish sir
okay repair the dish and
run an auxiliary patch
straight to our ground lines
you may have just killed
millions of people
stick him in holding
or ll kill him myself
colonel i had no choice but
to cancel the level five
you just severed our
defenses to a global threat
i confirm when to call off a
nuclear strike
i will skin him alive for this
sir emod live
and engaging targets
all nuclear
capable countries have confirmed
participation level five
give me a level five mark
we are live
targe engaged
okay
give me a real time kill ratio
keep me appraised level five
standing by for kill ratio
and level five standing by
have we restored communication
with the pentagon
eta 30 seconds sir
emod kill ration at 6%
and climbing 7% 8%
gwen check with vr
see wha happening
did the meteor shield deploy
mm-hmm
looks like we still have
incoming meteors
level five launch
in t minus 30 29
28 27
26 25
gwen
the meteors are still
coming through
wha going on
out there
all batteries are deployed
defense systems are firing
but tha not enough
oh shoot
8 7 6
5 4 3 2
phalanx one through four down
phalanx eight through 2 down
launch orthogonal 90 degrees
sir nuclear assets
in the entire
western hemisphere are offline
it seems like
theve been crashed
from a program out of wyoming
do we have backup
launch backup as soon
as it live
gwen wha
the status on that response
only 2% of the meteors
have been destroyed
twelve percent
still no sign of
the nukes
east coast backup system
is restored
t minus 0 and launch
east coast is go
russia is go
india is go
us arsenal 50%
no
no no no no
what what what
what is it
the nukes
theve detonated the nukes
i have vr confirmation
that theyve launched
from the east coast along with
all the other nuclear countries
this is dr armstrong
come in
wha our percentage of
airborne nuclear missiles
50%
all other countries have
launched their full arsenal
orbital weapons
all ordinance and drones
are completely destroyed
wve also lost four out of 20
of our communication satellites
the only thing we have left
is the shield sir
yeah
michael why did you let
them launch the nukes
dr armstrong your husband
has been arrested
for a breach of
national security
his attempt to take down
the nuclear guidance system
was stopped but we were only
able to fire half our payload
colonel sir
i assure you that michael was
just forwarding the message
if yore involved in
any way in any of this
you will never see
light of day again
now return to base immediately
and report to me in command
michael been arrested
and singh wants me to report
to the command center
as soon as we arrive
but you cant report to singh
if he has you arrested
youre done
wre all done
mar absolutely right
i can run predictive
algorithms all day long
but spectral imaging that is
your area of expertise gwen
by the time i compile the data
it would be too late
her what were gonna do
as soon as we arrive
at the security checkpoint
i want you to report
your injuries
under code blue they cannot
arrest any injured personnel
right
thell definitely have
mps looking for you
all over the medical bay
i imagine they will but ll
find my way to the lab okay
ill get the proof and ll
meet singh in command center
got it
defense alarm
hey what have we got
no
no no no
the strike is complete sir
all nuclear weapons
from all countries
have detonated in orbit sir
wha our kill percentage
25% sir
what
tha not possible
meteor shield taking
heavy fire sir
sir the entire shiel
coming apart
son of a bitch
im good im good im good
let go where is everybody
why are there no guards
i protocol to secure
all personnel
inside the facility
during a launch
looks like the cameras
are down thanks michael
code blue
where the or
or why
what happened
please
ive lost a lot of blood
how what happened
i was hit by a meteor
come on
we dot have time
where do you need to go
or
come on
code orange is now in effect
all medical personnel report
to your designated
emergency response locations
im all right
im all right
oh god i should wrap this up
yeah im okay
dont worry about me
give us a minute please
thank you
im fine im fine
just get the gauze
wrap me up
we gotta go
just grab anything
wha wrong with you
im fine
mara what happened
im fine
all right come here
you have to help me
hold on
all right
are you sure yore all right
okay sit down
im sorry
i all right
just a quick wrap
we gotta go
i know
mara you sure
youre all right
im fine
hey thank you
yeah
we have to go talk
to colonel singh
are you okay
yeah
let go see singh
okay all right
let get you going
pop up
where the screen here
there
all right so
tha good
and these coordinates
nine
okay
this database
around the meteor cloud
the density
let find you
officer pritchard
dr siegel
colonel singh sir
as soon as the storm passes
we will be disbanding
your department
the incoming is so heavy
we can barely get damage
report from the field
colonel sir
dr armstrong thought
the threat was big enough
she doesnt give orders
i give orders
where is gwen armstrong
sir she left us as soon
as we arrived
well she needs to be here
at this com
to be questioned
by me personally
people are dead
and dying dr siegel
sir
officer pritchard
sir ve been working
the field with dr armstrong
for over seven years now
and her input concerning
this storm
is critical to our survival
mm-hm
im aware of your work
with dr armstrong
her husband hast
been shy about reporting
your failures in russia
here
there
there you are
there you are
yep i knew it
okay okay
yep
you know what
gwen armstrong has been flagged
as a national security risk
and i cannot have her
wandering this base
colonel sir you must
let her complete her testing
before you speak
dr siegel i respect you
and im trying
to respect your team
but after the russia incident
and today failed
orbit defense
you are no longer cleared
to advise this base
are you with me
where the power reserve
the last impact carried
an electromagnet pulse
the reserve power
offline sir
engineering en route
right now to repair it
and the communications
engineering running
a dedicated line
to both the dish
and the command center
that goes all the way to dc
engineering doing
their best right now
sir please
detaining gwen
is a grave mistake
no one is more steeped in
this research than she is
we are dealing with
global threats right now
not on gwen armstrong latest
free-association
youre team is relieved
i an asteroid
i have proof
undeniable proof
i just needed to wait
for the information
to come in to create
a spectral image
there over 00 observatories
the observatories
cant see it
and it wot show up on radar
until it emerges out of
meteor cloud that covering
and then it gonna hit earth
i dont see how
a rainbow reflected back
from a meteor cloud can create
an image like this doctor
we kept picking up
a dense section on our radar
it failed to yield
anything definitive
but i knew that something
was acting on these meteors
slowing them down
so i took a sustained
spectrometer reading and
there it is
so yore telling us
this asteroid
is cloaked
by its own meteor shower
this is the sun okay
during it last perihelion
phaeton was knocked off course
causing it to go back
into the meteor trail
when it finally caught
up with the meteors
it exerted its own
gravitational force
causing the meteors to slow down
and making them safe
to actually enter into
our own atmosphere
which is what causing
the meteor storm outside
so even if we were to
destroy all of the meteors
we still have a 26-mile
asteroid to destroy
where will it strike
difficult to say
which is why dr siegel
has run a sequencing
algorithm kurt
its trajectory places
it on the northernmost tip
of manitoba 538 miles
west of the bay
fortunately i was able
to upload its vector
to a priority list before
the last power outage
i far from
a populated area
that doest matter sir
the force will be equivalent
to one million hiroshimas
so that why you fought
so hard to stop level five
exactly
now with what we have
we need a surgical response
surgical
mara
we have about
2000 warheads left
at 50 megatons each
tha 00000 megatons
50000 per stage of attack
good
so it hast reached
a million megatons yet
we need to use half
of our remaining nukes
to dissipate the meteor cloud
then shoot the other
half straight
at the asteroid to destroy it
sir were back online
all systems are active
daniels you need to get
joe ambrose on the phone
and you go get your husband
copy that
michael
oh my god
what are you doing here
oh god
i was so scared
i was so afraid
you got hurt out there
is there any update
they need you in command
wve proven that
there an asteroid
is colonel singh working
with the pentagon
he is and he needs
you and me the entire team
come on
let go
let go
sir we just
received a priority alert
on the data cloud
so has every other
major observatory
across three continents
who sending this out
nasa jpl ams and fema
just forwarded it
from our base in wyoming
i a live vectoring model
what do the vectors target
we dot know sir
i a field sir
with precise measurements
28 miles
3 miles 262
i have ambrose
on the line sir
ah
general ambrose
i colonel singh wyoming
our research team just confirmed
a million megaton sir
mm-hm
we have a near earth object
with all intel

phaetho projecting
meteors straight at us

a severe response
keep working to get the
remaining of our nukes operable

general this is
gwen armstrong
do you have a
confirmed target
i an asteroid sir
two-square miles
ive sent you all
the data
what is the eta to impact
one hour and 5 minutes
the strike requires
a two-step response
50% into the meteor cloud
and 50% directly into
the asteroid
no gwen
whoa
babe you okay
yeah yeah yeah you
yeah
go get to the entrance
mara go go go go

gwen come on
here take my hand
come on let go of the bag
no
i can lift you
i shoulve listened
to you from the start
oh
all right
ladies and gentlemen
our two-mile wide field
is an incoming asteroid
sir are we talking
about the one
that disappeared behind the sun
phaeton
tha affirmative
we need to use the rest
of our nukes
on a stage-two
level five response
we need to set our
targeting system
so that the first wave
of nukes all hit
the exact same spot
of the meteor cloud
that will create a compound
wave to dissipate the cloud
and reveal the bigger asteroid
so we can target it
tha brilliant sir
this is gwen armstron plan
and yes it is
sir we just lost two more
communication satellites
but we do have communication
with other surviving bases
prepare for the first wave
yes sir
stand by
level five
level five is go
level five is go
level five is go
50% response go
heat signature at 4% 2%
sir it working
the cloud is beginning
to dissipate
heat signature one percent
level five stage two
target that asteroid
50% go
the asteroid is still intact
the nukes were ineffective sir
they were unable to make
contact with target
damn it
impact estimated
at 38 minutes
make sure the president
congress
and joint chiefs of
staff are evacuated
to the doomsday bunker
yes sir
we are now being informed
that the mission
to destroy the incoming
asteroid was unsuccessful
a general evacuation order
has been issued
for the entire east coast
of the united states
wve also received word
that the presiden motorcade
is being redirected to the raven
rock bunker in pennsylvania
god help us all
gwen
gwen
no we have to go
no wre not having another
russia incident
michael with all due respect
you were not there
she did what she was
supposed to be doing
did she she had 5 minutes
before that order came in
to ground those planes
gwen are you okay
i gave her
the orders michael
it was my fault okay
we were supposed
to meet kurt in russia
im the one that told her
to stay behind
it was my fault michael
she stayed because of me
well they didnt have to
pin the whole thing on you
michael
okay how much time
do we have left gwen
we have 34 minutes
and we already launched
phase one and phase two
of the nukes right
so what plan b guys
plan b is we make
our way to the airfield
about a mile from here
now there two birds
on the ground
we evac to safety all of us
no no no
wre not gonna evacuate yet
look there could be
a solution here
i a long shot
but it could work
the braeburg effect
braeburg
come on gwen enough of that
you know he a laughing
stock of our community
okay but kurt
listen to me okay
the last few hours
ive been noticing
that all this meteor impact
has displaced methane
into the atmosphere
when you add
an electrical force to methane
it turns into plasma vapor
now the tests i took this
morning of that meteor
it proves that it
has magnetic force
so if we somehow find
6000 megawatts of electricity
and create an electrical arc
up into the atmosphere
it could actually displace
that electromagnetic force
and then
and the nukes
and the meteors
and the asteroid all
crashing together
yes and destroy them
okay i understand that
but where are we gonna get that
power that wattage
we dot have that
there a power plant
not far from the airfield
can we use that
yes but we would
need some sort of
a massive controlled
explosion
exactly
one of those f-35s has
to be stocked with missiles
okay okay
let go to the hangar
let go let go
okay let get
to the airfield
let go
come on come on
okay the base
is through the field
for those of you at home
or hopefully
having found shelter
we have an update
from pentagon officials
raging fires are widespread
throughout north america
as a result of
the massive meteor shore
hundreds of thousands of home
have been damaged or destroyed
injuries and deaths are
estimated to be in the hundreds
the national weather service is
now reporting that this storm
is due to a
gravitational slowdown
from inside of the meteor cloud
caused by
two-mile-wide phaethon asteroid
which is due to impact
earth within the hour
come on guys
come on come on
come on
let go come on
let go let go let go
come on move it move it
let go kurt come on
whoa

dean

dean nice tie
lovely day
good boys
work those legs gaffney
where your energy
i think im gonna be sick
one cupcake over the line catlady
this is total crap
i cant play for this drill sergeant
play for us charlie
the ducks come on man
all right fulton
get low bend your knees
smooth strokes
that it fulton stay low
julie the cat
what the matter you eat a fur ball
yeah that good coach
i like that fur ball
that uh very clever
just get in the net goldberg
me sure thing be my pleasure
yeah
over here over here
you know i dont see a captain out here
on your left pass it
make him make the first move conway
hey averman you got nothing
over here charlie
come on charlie clear it out
clear it out
freeze i said freeze
averman
i did freeze
where the one place you
never want to clear the puck
it looked open
just answer the question conway
listen im not a defenseman
im a scorer
follow me
anybody share his opinion
all right then take a knee
what the one thing all
great teams have in common
great coaching
dont try to suck up to me averman
defense
see unlike scoring defense never quits
but to play great defense
you need one thing above all else
bet it starts with a w
confidence
listen if you learn nothing
else when youre here you learn this
all right
cause it not just about hockey
it easy to be confident
when you have control of the puck
it very very difficult
to keep that confidence
when you gotta take whatever
strange bounces life throws your way
dont be careless
but dont be too careful either
you cannot be afraid to lose
that how you gain the confidence
to attack the game
when the puck isnt yours
that how you attack life
even when you think
you dont have any control
and that how you play real defense
is this seat taken
you know you are just like
the rest of those snobs
i am not a snob
oh really
well you dont like me
because im an athlete
that a snob you dont even know me
if i knew you i wouldnt like you
oh yeah well try me
hi im charlie conway
im a 4-year-old
almost six-foot nonsmoking leo
i like hockey pizza and music
and i dislike
everything about that school
except maybe you
now you try
im linda
i dont like it here either
and pizza
i like pizza

what is this all about
sit down
that his daughter
she was injured in a car accident
about five years ago
he was driving and they got sideswiped
so that why he gave up playing pros
when the north stars left minnesota
he stayed
he didnt want to disrupt her recovery
her doctors and her friends were here
we all just thought he was some
washed-up bully who couldnt hack it
he can hack it charlie
he just simply made a choice
i dont think he ever
regretted it for a minute
come on
check this out
look at that hair
i look like greg brady
i was like you charlie
when i played hockey
i was a total hotshot
tried to take control of every game
i wound up quitting
so i tried the law
same thing
i rule in the courtroom
but inside im a mess
i started drinking
man i was going down
but then this
great thing happened
maybe the best thing ever
i got arrested
and sentenced to community service
and there you were
charlie and the ducks
and as hard as i fought it
there you were
you gave me a life charlie
and i want to say thank you
i told orion about all this
when i talked to him about taking over
i told him that you were
the heart of the team
and that you would learn
something from each other
i told him
that you were
the real minnesota miracle man
you did
i did
so be that man charlie
be that man
hey nice move

if you can make it quick dean
were running late as it is
im afraid this is important
we have a board meeting
scheduled tomorrow and
well you all are on the agenda
we have to think long-term here
what in your best interest
hard as it is for me personally
because you kids have been a breath
of fresh air around here
the board is going to approve
the withdrawal of your scholarships
now youll be welcome to stay
through the end of the semester
but after that
it will be necessary for you
to enjoy other educational opportunities
dean i need a word with you
i think ive said all i need to say
no now
other educational opportunities
what he saying russ
ill put it in terms you can understand
adios amigo
adios amigo
oh i see
so that it
youre dumping em just like that
coach im sorry
your team isnt performing
and ive been under enormous pressure
from whom the alumni group
a bunch of aging pep clubbers
ted im trying to do you a favor
with those kids gone
youll get to pick your own team
let face it the ducks are drowning
i got my team
either they stay or i go
well miss you ted
why us
cause he a slime
yeah i know
where that dude lives
were just pawns
puppets for the stage show
jesters to entertain the king
barnacles on the bottom of
shut up
coach is this legal
i mean dont we have
contracts or something
i dont know what it is
all i know is were gonna fight it
do i have a motion for reconsideration
im sorry coach but unless there is a
motion from a board member and a second
the decision must stand
told you not to worry
you leave us no choice
but to bring in our attorney
please
dean buckley members of the board
as counsel for coach orion
and the freshman hockey team
im here today to set forth
your legal options
so that you may make the best possible
decision for all parties concerned
mr bombay this isnt a legal proceeding
not yet but i can assure you
that it will be
do you mind
these scholarships
an offer
became a binding contract upon
the signatures of the recipients
and acceptance by the ducks
they cannot be voided except for cause
which i guarantee you you have none
should you decide to pursue
their cancellation
i will slap you with an injunction
i will tie this matter up
in court for years
until long after these kids
have gone on to college
and i will collect damages
i will win
because i am very very good
you know why im so good
because i had a good education
you gave it to me
and youre gonna give it to these kids
he is good
just gettin started
now some of you may be snobbish enough
to believe that
these ducks dont belong at eden hall
let me tell you you are dead wrong
these are remarkable young people
you give them their full shot
and i promise you they will succeed
not only on the ice
but in the classrooms as well
these people are my friends
and i know what they can do
accordingly
i demand that you reinstate
their scholarships
for their benefit
and for your own
this is ridiculous really
what going on man
i move that the scholarships
be reinstated
is there a second
all in favor
we have no choice
scholarships reinstated
for hans charlie
ive got some business in chicago
but ill be back soon

bulgaria is known as
the land of roses
in 945 the communist regime
seized political power in the country
and nationalized every
private property and enterprise
rose oil distilling was monopolized
by the totalitarian state
the rose became one of the symbols
of the communist party
based on a true story
damascena the transition
july 969

and one secret
this secret became my dream
i could not fulfill my dream
i ran out of time
may 978
what is the name
of the rose richest in oil
rose damascena
do you know why
it was brought from damascus
in ancient times hence the name
is there something you dont know
techo
it takes a million roses to make
one kilogram of rose oil
one million picks
one million seconds are needed
to pick all those roses
human hands are needed here
the thracians were a wise people
they started growing roses here
herodotus himself mentions it
and why exactly here
look at the valley
the valley of thracian kings
guarded by mountains
on both sides
rivers flow into it and
irrigate it
as if the gods themselves protect it
the most aromatic roses
how many trucks left
you are wasting my time all day
this is the last truck for today
yeah really
give a hand to the girls
these are picked by the students
no need to check them
no need yeah right
as if i dont know
look at this
too young to cheat right
i have found stones
bags of water
and all kinds of stuff inside
o tempora o mores
i wont waste your time

rose oil is liquid gold they say
it brought millions and millions
to the state
for me the rose oil distillery was
a temple not a cash machine

at the expense of the state

there nothing for me here
brother
i know youve got 7 kilos
of my rose oil in the trunk
you have a choice
you can either give me back my oil
and we go on together
or you can go to the city
and we forget were brothers
you know what
is she worth it
she will bring you money
what going on
we fixed gyula
well get some cash
is this the life you want
you call this a life
cousin
this girl is coming with me
get up
dont worry
the baby asleep in the back
the baby peed on the dollars
i hope it a lucky charm
where are we going
i dont know
today the national currency continued
its severe devaluation
one us dollar traded for 200 levs
on the interbank market
the cash markets followed
a different logic
the usd interbank trade started at
bgl 500 -650
but by noon the exchange rate
was up by bgl 500
and the ask spread hit
bgl 250 at noon
then the rate decreased and
a balance was reached
at a bid spread of bgl 800
and an ask spread of bgl 200
it is paradox that an ask spread
is significantly below the bit spread
trading was strained
usd 66 million were bought
and almost usd 5 million were sold
the volumes are below the ones
common for the past days
i do not expect that from you
the national currency again lost
more than 20% of its value in just a day
since the start of the year
the dollar
has tripled its value against
bulgarian lev
the usd appreciated
with nearly 200 bgl today
are you ok
the posters read pensions 5 dollars
sausage 2 dollars
the protesters shouted against
a new socialist government
and in favor of early elections
elections elections
take some money from the sack and
go buy something for yourself
what something
clothes shoes
whatever you need
and get disposable diapers
for the baby
tell them the baby age
seven months
do you want anything
no
youre staying here
first private bank
give our money back
hey where are you going
the line back there
hey wise ass
take you place at the back
where you going with the sacks
get back
go inside and tell your boss that
techo is waiting for him outside
can you please go to the
end of the line
ive been freezing here all day for
20 dollars and now that guy
easy there are dollars
for everyone
what are you doing here techo
the privileged ones will never end
keep calm
it a madhouse
the dollar has gone through the roof
yes indeed
this isnt inflation
it an outright catastrophe
the dollar reached
bgl 3000 in a day
and what
everybody gone nuts
trading their last penny
i know it
i can see it from the hotel
over there
but i tell you the dollar
will fall in 3 days
it cant happen
itll take at least a month
i bet my beard on it
and i bet my hair
you want these dollars
youre killing yourself bro
do you want them
or should i go to your neighbors
did you piss on it
just take them
money doesnt smell
that what people say
plank come here
handsome though
here are the levs
where are my dollars
give him the dollars
hey plank
you gonna stick around here
come with me
get off please
youll live here
my friends will help you -
with the kid with the school
if things turn out well
you might come to work for me
but for now
this is the right way
get off please
ill never fancy another man techo
i only have eyes for you
may you have women
but be deprived of love
i kept building the temple
of the rose by the river
near the place where
it all started
dreams are always
greater than prayers
it very hard to deceive
a dreamer
a lie may slow him down
but will never stop him
how do you manage to spend
so much money in no time
last month i gave you 00 000 dollars
you not only spent all the money
from the rose oil distillery
but you are trying to kill yourself
with new loans every month
i pay you back dont i
along with the monstrous interest
you see
the temple of the rose requires
a lot of money
be careful techo
my head flies off if you
ill need some extra help
shave my beard
son ive been watching you
for years
the freedom you search for
does not exist
it an illusion
it a prison
a prison
to be free means to
choose your own prison
youre greedy
a man shouldnt be greedy
money
women
freedom
everyone has his own limits
limits for all three of these
if a man goes over his limits
they crush him
and that all
he finished
you were such a wild kid
look at you now
so many people
depend on you
techo you promised me
you promised me
dad
you promised me
roses will blossom -
with or without us
well
with us is preferable
im leaving you too soon
my son
too soon
yes you left me too soon
we had so much to do together
too soon
all left me
fate left me too
where are your workers
stavri
theyre packing and leaving
oranges olives dishes -
whatever pays
germany spain
who knows where
where is that terminal 2 that swallows
our children like a dragon
tell them not to leave
what for
let them know that from now on
i will double their pay
dont do that
well lose everything
youll fuck up the others too
theyll kill us
what if the buyers
disagree
that a fucking suicide
first time ever right
emigration -
the modern slavery
a subtle slavery that allows for
the illusion of freedom
25 million bulgarians
have left the country
not a single war
has caused so much damage
i thought youd never come
you can use an extra hand
i cant buy your oil techo
these are hard times
everyone produces
but there are no buyers no markets
turkey is crushing us
turkey
bulgaria
bulgaria

now bulgaria is missing
from the rose oil map
so what do we do
nothing but pray
youre praying

hasan bey
bulgaria and turkey are the largest
rose oil producers in the world
we were a leader until recently
the markets were yours
but now theyre ours
it isnt our fault that your country
has problems
were making large investments in
rose plantations
we have a good product
western companies came with
their investments
leave us this much 20%
give us some room to breathe
there terrible corruption
in bulgaria
the communist elite
switched sides
now they are the rich ones
who rip off the society
other nouveau riche come from
the criminal underground
we look after our business
you better fix your country
i can see you know very well
the problems in bulgaria
with all due respect hasan bey
my forecast is that in 7-8 years
you will have problems similar to ours
the wheel spins
things may turn around
i dont see how
i will turn them around
only time will show
may allah be with you
cousin stop the car
stop the car
take me back to the clinic
take me back
hey cousin
ill come to see you often
dont worry about me
youre not a free man cousin
im the free one among us
i started drinking
i really hit the bottom
i gave up
did you forget me
i didnt forget you
i renounced you
why did you stop dreaming
because i became a slave
a slave of the state
to the banks
to the mafia to their money
to my women to my children
a slave to everything
and everyone
it a voluntary prison
and you leave it
voluntarily too
good morning
techo ive known you for ages
why didnt you call me earlier
you sound like an
abandoned lover
you dont understand do you
you were dead
ive been drinking
for three weeks
you would be dead
on the third day
you really dont get it
your condition is really serious
some tests must be made
youve had symptoms
long before havent you
symptoms
i have symptoms
as many as you like
ill be going
well how do you want me to say it -
delicately or outright
delicately speaking there is
a tumor somewhere inside you
in the head
in the head
and
how much time do i have
plenty of time if i cut it out
prepare yourself for surgery
well
and what if you dont
cut it out
it will continue to grow and
depending on how aggressive it is
it could be months weeks
tomorrow
tomorrow
i see youre afraid
you dont get it at all
no it normal
were all afraid
but youre lucky because
i am a really good surgeon
i am calling the team
you really dont get it
no i dont
if you have to do
something important

that not the point
leonard wanted to help
so he offered to give us money
and you said yes

well maybe this check is for both of us
like he added an extra zero
it too much
what are you doing
im calling him we cant keep this

all these letters
didnt you say that leonard never married
we shouldnt do this
all right
let go
we need to call 9
holy
what
that a lot of money
you said he lived alone
here for how many years
people get a little eccentric
start by putting some aside
little by little
and before you know it
he doesnt have any family
itll end up in a police locker somewhere
governmentll take it
why should we let it get caught up
in the system like that
when it could actually do some real good
i mean you said yourself how much
he cared about you he wanted to help
he did
well there you have it
a way for him to help you
help us
we would have to be careful
yeah we will
adam
yeah
promise me

so how long did you work
for mr wellsley
about four and a half months
and you lived here too
leonard stayed here alone at night
that how he wanted it
he could still get around okay
when was the last time you saw him
yesterday afternoon
we left a little early
to go to the bank around
around 430
and you worked here too mr kettner
just a couple weeks
i was doing some yard work for leonard
were married
i kind of got that
yeah
so how was mr wellsley doing
was he having any health issues recently
no he been fine i mean

so he took a lot of medication but
but he wouldnt have complained about it
anyway
he wasnt like that
well im gonna need to get some
contact information next of kin
he doesnt have any family
no
no
im sorry for your loss
if you have any questions
just give me a call
leonard once told me
he wanted to be cremated
he wanted his ashes spread in the garden
let me get back to you
okay
thank you
where are you going
i have to talk to mr calvern
to get my name back on the list
what list
at the agency
for another position
why
because that what i should do
now that i dont have a job
if you dont hear back
about that job soon
maybe you should start looking again too
all right i will
ill see you later
okay
katie i am so sorry
the two of you were so close
i cant imagine what a shock it was
if there anything i can do
i would like to get another
assignment as soon as possible
oh okay well let talk in my office
okay
unknown
hello
speaking
oh hi yeah
i agree i thought
the interview went very
i see
yeah no i completely understand
thank you for calling
yeah you too
katie i assumed you knew
i cant put you back to work
not until the police finish
their investigation
investigation
well yes when a client expires
under the supervision of an employee
we cooperate with the authorities
to be absolutely certain that there was
you know how would it look
to a potential client
that there was even any hint of
wait you think i had something
to do with what happened to leonard
god no no of course not
no this is
im sorry katie this is company policy
there nothing i can do until the police
officially close their investigation
so how long is this gonna take
yeah i
i wish i knew
hello
hey
what were you thinking
you cant just come in here like this
like we still belong here
excuse me im bleeding right now
what do you want from me
we said wed be careful adam
i asked you and you promised me
you promised
all right okay
look i
im sorry
but if i wasnt here
i think that money would be gone
how could anyone know about the money
it leonard he kept it hidden
why else would they be here katie
you didnt see who it was
no they came up behind me
they couldnt have known you were here
they wouldnt have busted in like that
i heard the glass break
that why i came down
the back door was already open
and you didnt think
maybe that was a bad sign
that you should get out
no i didnt have time to think
the next thing i know i was waking up
to the sound of my phone ringing
how could you do this adam
this never should have happened
you never should have been here
that not the point
then what the point
almost a hundred grand that the point
youre always trying to justify your
you counted it
i counted to 92000 and there was more
then she calls me to say how sorry she is
that the hiring committee
decided to go another way
whatever the hell that means
i dont even know
theyre all just such assholes
im just sick of being poor
who was it adam
who got in here
maybe somebody
who did some work on the house
sometime before you started
leonard talked about hiring a gardener
but that was a couple of years ago
well whoever it was
i dont think it was a coincidence
they must have known
that leonard had passed away
and figured the house would be empty
yeah
but maybe youre right
maybe they didnt know about the money
they probably just wanted
to get in and get out
just grab whatever they can get away with
what if they come back
all right right this way
there you go
just ring when youre ready
thank you
babe
dinner on me
all right
temptation got me
i cannot resist that feeling
you make me want it
feels like all i ever needed
temptation got me
i cannot resist that feeling
you make me want it
feels like all i ever needed
morning
morning
i was just making you coffee
ms franklin this is detective chesler
we spoke at mr wellsley house
would you give me a call
when you get this message
you have the number thanks
sorry to keep you waiting
thanks for coming in
detective is there a problem
why dont we talk back here
did mr wellsley ever mention a will
no
and no family
he was all alone
well something like this
the rich old man living alone no heirs
we just have to cross all of our t
im sorry detective
i dont
what is this about
well you said that
mr wellsley asked to be cremated
so im assuming that you
want to honor his request
yes
yes we do
without a family and no will
the question becomes who bears
the cost of the arrangements
well take care of leonard
okay ive got the paperwork right here
what that
his favorite tea
thanks
for leonard
leonard
we should put the money back
it doesnt feel right
let just be here
for leonard
we should say something
and he shall be like a tree
planted by the rivers of water
that bringeth forth
his fruit in his season
and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
im sorry who are you
apologies ms franklin
my name is julia byron-kim
im mr wellsley attorney
ms byron-kim
leonard never said anything
about an attorney
please call me julia
and im not surprised
what do you mean
the first i heard from mr wellsley
was only a few weeks ago
he called me out of the blue
wanting me to write up his will
and asked me to come to the house
i never saw you here
he was very specific about that
i was to only come in the evenings
why
he left everything to you
oh my god
congratulations
oh my god
i dont even know what to say this is
say thank you leonard
wow
okay so what happens now
first i suggest you read
over the will very carefully
better yet i would have
your lawyer take a look
actually we dont have a lawyer
well mr wellsley did pay my retainer
in advance
asked that i help you
through this transition
what transition
we cant just move in right away
of course you can
with the understanding
that the will is going through probate
which takes about three months
and if there are any surprises
you should have someone
to look after your interests
now i understand if you
want to find your own lawyer
you said leonard called you
out of the blue
you didnt know him
i never met him before
why did he call you
he found me on the internet
he said that he liked my name
byron was his favorite poet
ms byron-kim
sorry julia
im kind of new at this
im not really sure
how to go about it officially
but i could really use your help
there are some big changes
coming your way
i hope youre ready
me too
and how about adam
what about him
well he does understand that legally
where it comes to this house
you make all the decisions
weve always decided things together
which is how it should be
these things you just never know
how it can change someone
well be okay
good
leave it to me then
great
congratulations
thanks
we should take a vacation for a month
just first class all the way
youll get your mba before you know it
find a great job
that piece of junk that we drive
we can pay off everything
credit cards loans
just wipe the slate clean
you know we should go right now
both of us just go pick brand new cars
come on adam im serious
yeah me too
we cant do that
why not we have the money
we cant just walk in there
with all that cash itll look weird
people are gonna ask questions
yeah no youre right
i did some research online
and been looking into that
into what
see there ways we can make it work
right we just spread the money around
different banks
different kinds of accounts
what are you talking about
if we do this right
it like nobody will ever know
we can get away with so much in taxes
adam
we still have to be careful
we have been careful okay
dont you think it time for us
to treat ourselves
you earned it
god knows i have
i mean maybe youre right
but we have to settle in first
take things slow you know just
just a little while longer okay
yeah
okay
well take it slow
ill call the movers see how soon
we can get them over here
what we dont need any of this stuff
what it our stuff
weve had it since we got married
yeah well here well keep the pictures
and some of those books
and we dont need the rest of this junk
what are we supposed to do with all of it
just leave it for the next poor losers
that have to live in this dump right
jeez adam
hello
yeah that was five months ago and
i already gave the police my statement
who was it who called you sir
i didnt get the name he just said
talk to someone at the front desk
i got nothing
mrkettner everything okay
he says somebody told him
to come down make a statement
what this regarding
like five months ago somebody robbed
the smile diner killed somebody
you were at the diner that night
yes
lucky you didnt get hurt
i kinda stopped the guy
you did
yeah in that situation i reacted
my wife was working that night so
ms franklin was there too
yeah but what i dont understand
is you already have the guy locked up
why do they need another statement
they dont
what are you talking about
that guy from the diner ray gaskin
yeah
he dead
somebody stabbed him
in his cell a couple weeks ago
so who called me
kind of wondering that myself
excuse me
hello katie do you remember me
yeah what are you doing back here
i know a pain in the ass right
but my client he driving me nuts
he just he absolutely loves the place
i think he wants to make an offer
i told you already
it not for sale
maybe if i could speak
with the owner myself
at least i can say i tried
look im really busy and you cant
just show up here like this so
i want you to go now please
you know katie
this aint my first rodeo
you know one of the first lessons
in real estate
if you want to find new listings
check the obituaries
yes
i know all about the late mr wellsley
sad
the house isnt for sale
you know ive had my eye
on this house for a couple years
the old man
kicks the bucket
and you think you can just move in
im gonna smile
wish you well
i own the house now
what the hell are you saying
leonard left it to me
i have his will i can prove it
yeah well for five grand
i can make a new will that says
it belongs to my dear aunt myrtle
i have a lawyer
of course you do
if you have any more questions
i suggest you talk to her
but in the meantime get the hell off
my property before i call the police
all right well i guess
ill see you around katie
he just messing with you
it not how it sounded
he practically accused me
of forging the will
babe trust me
the thing this guy cares about
is what he losing on commission
maybe i should talk to julia
the lawyer
why
in case hayden tries to make trouble
what could he do
i dont know but it like she said
we dont want any surprises right now
katie
this guy is just pissed off
forget about him
come on
it our first night in our new house
we should celebrate
yeah
mm-hmm
what did you have in mind
i can think of something
let me take a shower first
what
ive been cleaning the house all day
ill be right out
what is this
my old one stopped working so
looks expensive
well it a knock off
just bought it from some guy downtown
very convincing
you want company
ill be right out
detective
looks like i came at a bad time
no youre fine come in
you folks going somewhere
yeah were moving actually
into leonard house
leonard
as in mr wellsley
i know im still getting used
to the idea myself
leonard left it to me in his will
now then that is a very nice house
yes it is
congratulations
thank you
so a thing like that
what do they call it
a windfall
doesnt happen every day
nope
funny you forgot to mention it
what
the will and all when we spoke
i asked you about his family
about a will
oh no i didnt know about it until
after the service his lawyer came by
that mustve been quite a shock
yeah it was
id have loved to see
the look on your face
you know i mean you worked there for
what did you say four months
why are you here detective
i was hoping to speak with your husband
he not here
well maybe you can help me
see i was wondering
when you worked nights at that place
the smile diner
did he pick you up all the time
i mean he picked you up before
yeah
right but was it a set thing
was it every night was it certain nights
no not exactly
so how did he happen
to be there that night
i i called him to pick me up
and he came early to study
well you ought to play the lottery
katie
youre a very lucky woman
does this have anything
to do with the fact that
the police called adam
about making another statement
he didnt tell you
police never called adam
no i was here
they called him down at the station
no i checked it out after he left
there no record
of any calls to his number
that doesnt make any sense
why would why would anyone
send him down there for no reason
well maybe they had a reason
maybe it just not the one you think
take care now
thanks julia
ill talk to you later bye
katie
what did she want
i called her actually
what did you tell her
nothing
that not how it looked
looked like you guys were best friends
all of a sudden
well maybe if youd been here
maybe if youd answered your phone
we agreed
we decided you were not going
to talk to her
no you decided
like youve been deciding
a lot of things lately
what are you even talking about
why didnt you tell me
that it wasnt the police who called you
it was somebody else who made
sure you went down there right
who told you that
detective chesler dropped by
and she was asking a lot of questions
about you
about what happened
the night of the diner
what is that about
adam
how should i know
who called
who sent you to the police station
i dont know
my bad i was gonna tell you about it
it a whole lot of other stuff
has been happening right now
what other stuff
i think im being followed
what
i kind of had the feeling before
today i just went driving
around just around
i kept seeing the same car
did you go to the bank
come on we said we would not do that
no adam no bullshit
just tell me
did you go to the bank today
did you take money out
i noticed him
so i figured you know
it wouldnt be a good idea just in case
in case he was after the money
we dont know that
why else is he watching you
look maybe im just paranoid
okay maybe there nobody
who following me i dont know
you got sent down
to the police station adam
that way im here alone
that way hayden shows up
tries to intimidate me
scare us out of the house what is that
why is he here
because he probably knows
i warned you
chesler
hey tom
you did
great
great okay hold on
all right so probably just
from the last four five months
were looking for any checks drawn
on an account from a leonard wellsley
yeah made out to her name
yeah
it kate franklin
listen can you see
what you got on the husband too
it a different last name
it an adam kettner with a k
great get back to me
as soon as you can thanks
what are you looking for
leonard didnt just stash that money
it had to come from somewhere
there has to be a reason
does that even matter now
julia said
if they find out
weve been hiding something illegal
we could lose everything
all right
so what do you suggest
we just give it all back
i dont know
yeah maybe
to whom katie
i dont know
but this never felt right
im not going back to the way
things were before
adam
we may not have a choice
we always have a choice
i had absolutely no idea
that mr wellsley left katie the house
that seems a little
excessive
doesnt it though
yeah
what can you tell me about her husband
ive never met the man
so you had nothing to do with hiring him
as a gardener at the house
no it strictly against our policy
for family members to work together
our patients are elderly infirm
we cant risk that kind
of potential distraction
so do you know of ms franklin
ever breaking the rules before
never no
no she absolutely understood
the importance of her job especially
with mr wellsley
why especially him
well you wouldnt have known it to look
at him but his health was very delicate
you know katie told me
she kept a notebook
like a daily log
just to keep track of his medication
do you happen to have
a record of his medications
youd have to speak
with his doctor about that
right how about ms franklin contract
how much she was being paid
yeah sure we can get that to you
yeah
excellent thank you and let me
just ask you did she
did she ever mention a raise
good lord
she deposited that check
just before wellsley died
was she really taking money
from that poor old man all along
it a good question
adam
adam
shit
ethan
these were never cashed
you okay
i think i know who that is
what
leonard said something
about hiring a gardener
i think i told you about this
a guy named ethan
this was a couple years ago
so he been up there for a while
there were checks made out to ethan doyle
they were never cashed
leonard said one day
he just stopped showing up
never heard from him again
somebody shot him
you looked
he must have bled to death up there
he was murdered
yeah i think so
but
leonard couldnt have known he was there
right i mean he would have helped him
and why would doyle hide out in the shed
why not come into the house
maybe these have something to do with it
take a guess
wow
do you think theyre real
why else would he hide them
shit
here just
oh god
oh my god
give them here come on
im sorry
dammit
dont answer
i saw your car
but i cant my car is parked outside
they know im here
okay im just gonna
i got it
open the door
do you hear me katie
katie open the door please
im sorry this really isnt a good time
well yeah im sure youre very busy
settling into your new home
you should be ashamed of yourself
how could you take advantage
of that poor man
what
look i knew something was up
i could feel it
but you know what you had him
so frightened he couldnt even tell me
it not no
im not letting you
tarnish my company good name
mr calvern
ill find proof
im gonna call the police
im gonna have you arrested
this really isnt a good time
this isnt over katie
ill be back
im gonna find out what been going on
in this house one way or another
im not letting this go you hear me
im not gonna lose my business over this
why isnt this full
katie
hey katie
hey
didnt you hear me
hi sorry i was making tea
you want some
no i got you a present
a new phone
yeah got one for each of us
new numbers too i figured
the way things were going
we could both use a little privacy
we cant keep them
katie
adam no
there is a dead man out there
he was murdered
he stole those diamonds
and who knows what else
he may have done who he may have hurt
these things dont just go away
like they never happened
the police must be looking for him
dont you get this
doyle stole the diamonds
got himself shot
and then he died out there all by himself
it like it like he fell down a well
two years later
nobody knows what happened to him or
the diamonds we can do whatever we want
what are you doing
im calling detective chesler
we need to tell her
no wait
wait just okay hang on
just listen to me for just a second
okay ask yourself what the heck
was doyle doing here in the first place
why take some crappy gardening job
if he planning to steal a fortune
in diamonds
i dont know
some old guy house digging up weeds
is the last place
that anybody gonna come looking for him
i mean think about it
why else wouldnt he cash the checks
he didnt want to leave a paper trail
that way he sets up the big score
nobody knows about this place
and he can just hide here
for as long as he needs to
although im sure
that getting shot and dying out there
was probably not a part of the plan
that doesnt change anything
we cant keep those diamonds
all right so what about the money
what are we gonna do about that
what do you mean
if we do this
then the police put us under a microscope
so how is that going to look
we took the money from here
and then we hid it in the bank
what are they gonna think
well explain it to them
tell them it was leonard money
that it was his safety net
all right and then what
cause you heard what the lawyer said
even if they believe us
even if we dont end up in jail
we could still lose this place
we dont need this house adam
we dont need any of this
okay as long as we have each other
were going to be all right
all right
im done with all right
that not enough anymore
i told you im not going back
to the way things were before
and what about that man out there
what are we supposed to do about that
pretend it never happened
ill take care of it
how how are you gonna do that
this house
belongs to us now
okay this is our future
im not gonna let anybody
take that away from us
look everything is gonna be okay
ill take care of this for you
what are you doing
someone in the house
where did you get that
adam
dont
dont move
we need to call 9
freeze asshole
oh my god
calvern
where the girl
how are you holding up katie
detective chesler
hell of a thing
it was an accident
yeah that what theyre saying
either way
law says it self-defense so
it still makes you wonder
what was going through his head
why would he do something like that
just let himself into the house
i dont know
something had to set him off
i know none of this is you katie
what
everything was fine around here
until adam started work
so you can tell me whatever is going on
i know that none of it is you
i dont know what youre talking about
i know about your money problems
i know what that does to people
i know about the big check
that you deposited from mr wellsley
you dont understand
okay dont say anything katie just
just listen for a second
because
could be that
it was a loan
maybe it was a gift who to say
but i want you
to put yourself in my shoes
the big picture
how all of a sudden
everything just drops in your lap
i told you
i mean here i am
the coroner tells me
that the old guy died in his sleep
you tell me what his last wish was
and i figure sure why not
but it is not until after he cremated
that you find a will
i didnt find it
i didnt even know about it
and i dont even have a body
i cant even prove
that he didnt die a natural death
i mean i gotta tell you
it starting to keep me up at night
i would never hurt leonard
i am not talking about you
what
has adam ever mentioned anyone
by the name of gaskin a ray gaskin
i know that name
cause he tried to rob
the diner that night
and he also worked as a janitor
at the university
while adam was taking classes
no that not no
okay
it a big school maybe they never met
but sooner or later
adam is going to screw up
it only a matter of time
dont let him take you down with him
you come to me
baby
they wanna talk to you
hell of a thing
katie
hey
i heard what happened are you all right
ive been trying to call you
my number been changed
i need to talk to you
yeah come upstairs
okay
and this detective chesler
do you believe her
is it possible that
adam had anything to do
with what happened
at the diner that night
i dont know what to believe
did adam have any problems
with mr wellsley
any issues
no
no nothing
if the police suspect that adam
had anything to do with his death
theyll try to find a motive
theyre gonna try to claim
that he hurried things along
he hated being poor
okay listen to me
if chesler thinks she can make a case
she not gonna waste any time
she gonna try to get a warrant
and search the house right away
can she do that
you need to be asking yourself
will she find anything
you need to promise me
promise me
that youll help adam too
it gone
what
the money
adam must have taken it
that what you found cash
yeah
almost $00000
in the attic
we thought it was stolen at first but
and then what changed your mind
the diamonds
so you found diamonds in the house
in the living space above the garage
does adam have these diamonds
yeah
you need to stop him
what why
he knows you suspect something
that why he took the money
he disappears and throws you to the cops
no adam would never do that
are you sure
you need to find him bring him
to the house and then call me
youre not coming with me
i need to hold off detective chesler
i dont want her serving
the search warrant
till we know adam in the house
detective chesler
detective johnson
what have we got
garbage truck was making its rounds
this morning called it in
how long he been in there
me still en route
you beat him here
damn
why did you call me
there was a backpack next to the vic
inside we found an old laundry receipt
it pretty faded but
the address matches the name
from one of your cases
what the name
leonard wellsley
come on adam pick up
whereve you been
adam
im up half the night talking to the cops
i wake up in the morning
youre already gone
there no note
you havent answered your phone all day
whereve you been katie
the bank
that one of the things
i need to talk to you about
why did you take the money
cause were in a lot of trouble
checked up on that real estate agent
hayden
i mean what this guy deal
why he so interested
in selling this particular house
guess what
there no record of a mickey hayden
getting a real estate license
what
yeah he just got released from prison
did a couple years
for robbing a jewelry store
jewelry
one of those spots downtown
doesnt even use a gun
he just sweet talks his way
through the security door
then he blindsides the armed guard
does some old school
like smash-and-grab
sixty seconds
comes out with three million dollars
in loose diamonds
that were never recovered
that why he was here
hang on it gets better
cops think that he had an accomplice
that they never found
you wanna take a wild guess
this other guy gets shot during
the burglary then he gets away
doyle got away with the diamonds
and
there only one other person
who couldve known about it
the one who shot him
hayden
this bastard didnt bother
to use a fake name what did he think
we werent smart enough to figure it out
we have to call the police
no the only thing that we need to do
is get the hell out of dodge
we got plenty of travel money so
сan you go pack some stuff up real fast
im gonna go get cleaned up
you were never gonna leave me
what no why would i ever leave you
get changed
hi julia
it katie
yeah he here but
listen it wasnt him
where are they
i dont know
call him out here
adam
adam
adam
right here baby
let her go
look i just want the diamonds
i said let her go
ive been waiting a long time for this
so how about
you just tell me where they are
some place youre never gonna find them
are you gonna shoot me kid
that right
cause if i just give you the diamonds
youll shoot both of us
here the thing though
even if you hit me from there
my gun gonna go off and it gonna
blow a hole in her the size of your head
and we dont want that now do we
so let just talk about this
adam
son of a bitch
adam
no
adam
baby
adam
baby
please
adam
in the garden
stay with me baby
katie
oh my god
here katie
im sorry
here sit
hey
katie listen
we need to look for the diamonds
before the police get here
do you understand
it the only way we can explain
what happened without implicating you
adam never would have hurt leonard
katie the diamonds
how could i have ever thought that
it was hayden
hayden
killed him with an overdose
he read the logbook the one
i kept for leonard medication
i found the empty pill bottle
how do you know it was hayden
leonard used to tell me all the time
that he could hear someone in the house
but i never i
it was hayden
looking for the diamonds
he couldnt find them
but you did
i dont understand
why did hayden shoot doyle
why didnt
why didnt he end up with the diamonds
because he wasnt half as smart
as he wanted you to think
i mean how smart do you have to be
to decide to rip off your partner
shoot him while the cops are rolling up
and he still gets away
with three million dollars in diamonds
meanwhile you get busted
and spend two years in prison
i never told you how much
the diamonds are worth
oops
what are you doing
look okay i paid my dues
okay i spent ten years
as a public defender
how do you think i got hayden case
i knew he was an idiot
but i believed his story
and we had an agreement an understanding
and of course he messes everything up
i plea bargained his charges
down to two years
i traced doyle back to
when he worked for leonard
but the only thing
that i couldnt figure out
was where he was
turns out doyle was dead
you helped kill leonard
no i had nothing to do with that okay
that was all hayden he got impatient
he wanted to hurry things along
but i did have to do some fast maneuvering
to cover up for him
the will
it isnt real is it
it real enough
with no one to contest it
what the difference
look im sure leonard wouldve given you
the house if he was alive
but that is beside the point
right now i need you to tell me
where the diamonds are
i dont know
katie
adam hid them
i really dont know where they are
but i wouldnt tell you if i did
you know
that what i really liked about you
it was never about the money
but im sure theyll turn up
these things always do
katie
detective
im julia byron-kim
im ms franklin attorney
well ms byron-kim
im gonna need you to step out
so i can see both your hands
if you just give me a minute
to explain on behalf of my client
show me your hands right now
all right
detective if you would just listen
look out
stay back
are you okay
are you okay
youre okay sweetie youre okay
come on
come on
let get you out of here come on
this is detective chesler
im requesting a back-up
and an ambulance
at 27 queens

thank you
yeah were
were doing well
well i just came by to let you know
that the case is officially closed

thank you detective
weve been through that place
a half a dozen times
top to bottom

where adam hid the diamonds

craziest vivid dream
i was getting married
and the reception got ruined
for some reason
i thought everybody
would be cool with it
but they got pissed
so i jumped out the window
to escape
then i started getting chased
by this gigantic spider
then the spider teeth
fell out
which
according to dream analysis
that means he insecure
then i got worried
what if i was
in a spider dream
man what does
dream mean anyway
are we in a dream right now
are we always dreaming
probably not
aaaaaaaaaaah
whoa that was crazy man
i just had a dream i was doing
the opening for my show

for hands
more cheap props

constantly
i-i think -
i think everybody
who watches me
do you ever have dreams about
you doing stand-up
ill have those classic
actor dream
where it like
a full-packed house
and they cant remember
any of their lines
you know that happened
to me in real life
i actually went on stage
and ready to do my thing
and once i got out there
literally my whole brain
just went blank
couldnt think of one word
couldnt think of one song
has something like that
ever happened to you
i used to smoke
whatever it called
in my day it was grass
they called it mm-hmm
yeah
we call it dope
yeah
kush
and yes and fire pack
get loud
so i used to smoke that
mm-hmm
sometimes i would smoke
and have a drink
before i got onstage
mm-hmm
i would write a bunch
of real funny things
you think youre great
no matter what
youre doing there
yeah
then you look at it onstage
and it like hat sandwich
and it like what
so i quit that
so do you think like dreams
mean anything
do you remember
those little books
that would define your dreams
youd look up oh if you dream
a bug is on you
it means this
i guess the crazy dream
like that
in some sense
like i dont know
i have like a random baby mama
i aint never seen before
yes that happens to me
all the time
yeah
random baby mamas
yeah id be like
ive never seen this person
in my life
but then we have kids
in fact in the book
and we doing all type of shit
it said if you dream
about a random baby mama
baby mama
what does that mean
it means you like
to go roller skating
yeah
i thought you were about
to say go raw dog
like sometimes you have like
dumb simple dreams
like you could just dream of
i dont know just like
a boat floating in the ocean
with like
a piece of shit on it
ah yes
freud used to talk about that
that one dream everyone has
is a boat floating in the ocean
with a piece of shit on it
yeah
yeah you need to shit
on a boat
do you have like
nightmares and stuff
i do
one dream i had as a kid
okay
when i eat a pizza
i wouldnt eat the crust
for some reason
i tossed the crust away
mm-hmm
and then i had a dream
that i was -
i think i was walking
through the park
and all these crusts
of pizza jumped
attack of the pizza crust
yes
oh my god
and they were like snakes
they had eyes and mouths
so why would they want
to with you
when you were saving them
i know it
see this is why
pizza crusts are
very unappreciative
when i was a kid
february was like
a real hard month for me
that because it was
black history month
and i would be in school
and they would always show us
these civil rights movies
and shit every day
every day mother
getting bit by dogs
spraying them
with hoses and shit
and i would go home
and i had to sleep
in a bed with my mama
cause i would have nightmares
why was
martin luther king dream
my nightmare
yeah well i
yeah i think they should get
rid of black history month
for that because it -
it -
it gives people bad dreams
what do you think people in jail
dream about
uh
not being in jail
you ever wrote a joke
in your dream
not a good one

ah from the plague pit right on
but you know what i do
have for you coming in
ah incoming is always good
checks
historic jail exhibit check
i think this is one of the titanic ones
yeah it an exhibit
i designed for them
i spoke to a woman on the phone
and she has a victorian
cat o nine tails for sale
awesome
she said that we could come by
and take a look at it
well you know
that theyre very rare
so if it real i mean id pick it up
im not holding back
you wanna go take a look
oh yeah absolutely
hey im off to the bank
wait wait wait wait no
you have to take your daughter shayna out
to buy her dress for this dance
youve been avoiding it and
you cant avoid it any longer
for me i collect torture stuff
going to a mall is torture
she wants her daddy there
she wants her daddy wallet
but you have to go
tell you what if im
going youre coming too
all right
but first i need to check out
these cat o nine tails
oh man what the hell
welcome to the playroom
i mean this is wild
check out these tables
okay hey so youre a dominatrix right
retired which is why
im selling this stuff
and i thought youd like these things
that are rather dark
what the story with this table
it looks pretty old
this is a 950 operating table
people died on this thing side
rails held the arm pieces -
it sickening
and this one right here
i dont know it just me
but im getting a deeper
darker vibe from this one
this came from a turn of
the century women asylum
a psychiatric hospital
like a sanatorium
women were tied to this thing
no way
if you woke up with a headache
your husband could send you there
for as long as he wanted back then
you know at the risk
of sounding old fashioned
i kind of like that idea
just kidding just kidding
this is great
i came for something else
stef tells me you have an
800 prison flogging whip
can i see it
yeah
whoa that awesome
that is incredible and it ancient
it is a victorian-era british
prison cat o nine tails
for beating the convicts with
do you know how rare these things are
they were often destroyed
because the prison system
didnt want to admit
that theyd used stuff like this
yeah youre correct
this cat o nine tails
flogging whip is amazing
it a staggering find
hey rob come here for a second
what
you often wonder how
prisoners felt back in the day
when were researching this stuff
yeah
well youre gonna get to find out
youre in good hands
youre so evil so evil
this is gonna be great
yes i am and im going to
be loving every minute of this
i really dont know about this guys
i do
oh jesus
no more coffee stops
oh jesus
now i know what it feels like
oh nice
right on i enjoyed every second of that
ive gotta get down to business here
what your price
id like $600
$600
oh man i was thinking somewhere
along the lines of $ 200
im gonna put this in an exhibit
that im gonna put together
and assemble and tour
of ancient justice instruments
i have to keep the cost down
because i have to make the money back
by admissions as this tours
but if you own it a long time
and exhibit it often then
you will make money on it
$600
nah you know what
im really stuck at 2
im stuck at 6
really
you know what i hate to
say this because i likely
will never see another one in my life
but you remain the custodian of the whip
you sure
yeah ive gotta stay at 2 thanks
carolyn ran a really hard bargain
so i took a big chance
and walked for the door
wait
youll take 2
no 3
im not gonna quibble over $00
ive been after one for ten years
done $ 300 thank you so much
nice nice
that awesome
im really satisfied with
the price i paid for this
and truth be told i probably
would have paid a lot more
the last authentic one of
these i saw selling at auction
went for over $4000
today was a great day
stewart mclaughlin in a prison officer
from wandsworth prison in the uk
he also the author of
several prison-related books
and actually i got very
lucky that he was in town
and made time to meet with me
when i inquired what the oral history was
that this is a british
prison flogging whip
that was used on inmates for
infractions or punishments
what do you think
looking at this piece
it not like any official
cat o nine tails that ive seen
in any archive or museum
it certainly not
something that would have
been used in a british prison
in pre-870
the handle itself is way too short
as bit by bit stewart stripped away
everything i believed about this whip
i mean the measurements were wrong
the history was wrong
it wasnt a prison cat
i mean i started to feel
like a bit of an ****
id paid money on this my own
research my own knowledge
it wasnt right in this case
but i know in
british in penal colonies
around the globe
the smaller version of the cat
certainly serves as the boy cat
something like this
could be something like this
i think youre probably
looking at something
which may even be mid-800
stewart pointed out that
this was actually used
for flogging prisoners
maybe not in british prisons
but in penal colonies
this is still a rare piece
and it possibly earlier
than i ever thought it was
hey steve
yeah
youre gonna be happy
oh
i got your invite to
the annual invite-only
dark relics private auction
yes once a year i wait for this
and i printed you out pictures
awesome
knee restraints
oh i like that
spiked arm bracer to cleave
in someone face with
look at that
oh man that looks
like an antique coffin
it looks victorian maybe
yeah id say about the 800
that is awesome
you know what
id look great in here if i could win it
because you know who else go after this
oh money bags
yep it always the way
if i want it you know it gonna happen
yeah anything you want hell want
yeah
this guy i call money bags
he a new guy on the scene
collects the same stuff that
i do and has got deep pockets
he really pisses me off
and he has more money than you so
it true
youre fired
i want to know if this cat o nine tails
was ever used on human beings
so im having a blood test done on it
interesting
thing about blood stains
is that often at a crime scene
theyre washed out or bleached
and thankfully these
chemiluminescence agents
they allow us to see what is not there
would you mind turning
off the light please
no certainly
thank you
awesome
finger crossed here we go
okay
there it is saw it
you see it
wow
check it out and over there too
and look at the one
strand it dripping down
in three drops
it lighting up a like a neon sing
it is
look at that; it insane
now we just have to find
out if it human blood
can we do that next
yes that the next
test were gonna do
okay
this is the moment of truth i mean
that was a lot of blood
man this is awesome
we always believed this
was a flogging whip
for human beings and this
could be it right here
im gonna put my sample with blood on it
in the container
okay
and once again snap it off
close it back up again
shake it all up
finger crossed
one line is the control
one line is the control
and second line is
second line to
see if it human or not
what do you see
two blue lines
that amazing
this was used to draw blood
yes
that incredible
wow thank you so much
this cat o nine tails tested
positive for human blood
and that amazing
but i still dont know
where it was used and when
im gonna take it to another expert
but first my 3-year
old daughter is going
to her first major
school dance with a boy
im not exactly excited
to be here dress shopping
with her but it gotta be done
one-hundred and 50 200 bucks
this one i love
ta-da
how about this
it like 00 bucks;
it got good coverage
this is nice
no
look at how short the skirt is
no way
whoa sexy
wrong word change
now that is super
it horrible it
ugly it granny style
it elegant
it fun shopping with my dad
cause he pays for everything
but at the same time it annoying
dad youre embarrassing
why dont you just go
i could hunt for dark
artifacts and torture instruments
all day but looking at
dresses forget about it
just go
nothing skimpy no leopard-skin
trust me trust me
it on you see ya
bye
the day ive been
waiting for is finally here
the preview of objects from
the dark artifacts auction
i mean it one thing to
see pictures of these things
but to see them in person it amazing
hey hey hey hey hey
that amazing eh
check it out
that ive gotta have
check this out
this is so rare
it an actual hangman hood
it made out of leather
why is it so rare
because they disposed them
nobody wanted them
no way
bad luck man
the man that looked through
that took your life
that could go through the roof though
if people here realize what
that is the way i realize it
it could go really high
gotta have it
okay
it a really competitive business
you have to make a plan in
advance and stick to it
so do you want everything
id like it all but
there a few pieces
in particular that i want
one is the coffin and the other one is
that executioner hood
because that piece is so rare
think of how cool that coffin
would look in that corner
right behind my desk
im really excited about
this upcoming auction
but first i want to meet
with one more whip expert
to see if i can finally get to the bottom
of where and when this cat
o nine tails whip was used
hey peter
hey im an expert because of 50 years
of collecting reading
and writing about whips
you know i noticed
you brought a big bag with you
im hoping there more
than clothes in it
no i brought you some
whips from my collection
of 000 whips
awesome whoa
some stems from the
peter frisk collection
oh my god
that looks viscous
it is actually a rhino-hide
it from the belly of a rhino
could you imagine getting hit with this
and that what called a sjambok
it from south africa
it probably about 00 years old
that was used on people
that was used on people
this one here is a cossak
whip from the 9th century
a true cossak whip
a true cossak whip
it meant to be used for
horseback and cossak riding
in the russian army would
have carried a whip like that
probably an officer
this has caught my
attention immediately
this is awesome
what that
this is bone
it is bone and carved stone
and there a knife in the handle
check it out
would this be for stabbing
was this like a weapon
it might be for eating
your dinner actually
really like this
it very rare; it
should be in a museum
should be well it is
yours
yeah mine
that right
seeing your expertise and
your incredible collection
we came to the right guy
i mean i imagine there
nobody on the earth
that likely knows more
about whips than you
this cat o nine tails tested
positive for human blood
and that amazing but i still dont know
where it was used and when
yeah this is a fascinating whip
there is wear on them and age patina
im also looking at
the work of the joining
and the style of those is 9th-century
i have seen australian
convicts flogging whips
from the 9th century that resemble this
now i would add another possibility
okay
it also
resembles a photo post card
from the convict ship success
the success was the most famous
and notorious prison ship of all time
and when she retired they toured her
from port-to-port around the world
showing people the horrors
of the british penal system
this sticker is very very important
it a collection number
which appears to confirm
that it either in a museum on the ship
or somewhere else
my theory is that is was on display
set up in the convict ship success
everything consistent
it all fits in with success
this is killing me
i dont mean to interrupt you i have to
what it worth
it worth a lot of money
if it can be proved to be from success
it should be in the range
of possibly $0000
0000 bucks
even a 800 punishment
whip used on convicts
if we couldnt nail down
the ship certainly
even if you couldnt nail that down
it still worth three or four thousand
oh man this is great
so you have
a very valuable item
peter gave me some amazing
information about this whip
and now armed with that i know
that if i ever want to sell this thing
i could more than triple my money
wow
take good care of it
oh i will and you know what
if i ever decide to get rid of it
itll go to your collection
id buy it from you but
i know you wouldnt sell

this thing here was called a face puller
it went right over someone face
and theyd pull the
face right off a person
isnt that awesome
you know when you shake a
man hand it a sacred bond
but back in the day they had this
if you broke your word like for instance
what time you get home at night
theyd crush your fingers
between those plates
do you agree that promises
are very important
yes
yeah that good you know
this thing here check it out
it got these spikes on the inside
first theyd take a person hat off
so this could fit over top of the head
see all these sharp points
theyd twist the handle and the entire top
of the person head would disconnect

a full autopsy made huh
hey chris
who your new friend
sam my uh new driver
ed local school reporter
how do you do
nice to meet you
well uh what the
theory mr super sleuth
ed the last time

you had every suspect out
of town in 5 minutes
now just give me a
week to get an autopsy
and get some details down
and then maybe just maybe
i might give you a statement
right now do me a
favor and get lost huh
aw that no way to
talk to a journalist
hey you know what the
penalty is for impersonation
in this state
go find yourself a corpse
nice to have met you
sighs
christopher
yeah
do you really have a theory
no not really
but there is a possibility that
uh there a gang war going
on between the black gangs
and the chinese gangs
and that guy was
definitely no wasp
you know what i think
i think the best move
to make is keep an eye
on each end in this town
right now
right now
oops sorry
hey wait
wait
hey
hey
hey you driver wait
music playing
woman voice please
help me somebody
please help me

man screaming
may the peace of the
almighty be with you
may your soul rest in peace
puking
may the peace of your
life with you forever
and ever and ever amen
gagging and coughing
you all right sam
yeah ive just never seen
anything like that before
yeah neither have i looks
like two murders in two days
in the same station jesus
well looks like your
murderer wasnt greedy
they say they found
a full wallet on him
so that leaves out robbery
that good thinking ed
that very good thinking
guess what i wanna make a
statement about yesterday
ok just a moment
ok
that uh body that
was found in the subway
yeah
it was definitely dead
and the department figures that
the probable cause of death
was murder
thank you
you wanna know what i think
yeah
about four years ago it
was a story in the papers
it seems that when they were
building the old subways
they had to break
through the sewers
and it seems that
a lot of workmen
broke through the sewers and
were attacked by animals
these were animals
that had become
mutant dogs cats rats
alligators all the throwaways
and they developed
senses that other animals
didnt have fangs claws
theyre wild
they lived off each other
survival of the species
and they attacked the workmen
now i think it very possible
that those workmen did not seal
up the sewers where they
should have been sealed up
and that those animals are
roaming through the subways
hey thanks
youre welcome
for the story
hey come on
youre not gonna
print that are ya
sounds like an edgar alan
poe story for christ sakes
hey look sam
let start using some
rational logic huh
and lesson one keep your mouth
shut in front of reporters
save the horror
stories for the kids
come on
magmore stay
here with this body
until the guys from
the morgue get down
police point the finger
at underground animals
according to a
well-informed source
the recent subway murders may
be attributed to mutant cats
rats and dogs
inbred and inhabiting
the subways for several years
christ that all we need
well have every little old
lady who sees a mouse asking
us for protective custody
well i got carried away
well next time
dont get carried away
now weve got definite
reports on fighting
between the chinese
and the black gangs
in the same areas
as the murders
now this first guy was chinese
the other guy just may have
been some unfortunate bystander
but the way both
bodies were mutilated
i cant help thinking that--
well anyway this is
what were going to do
ok i put men on stakeout at
every subway station from 68th
street down to 96th street
that gives us a cordon
around the entire area
where the murders took place
ive also got a hotline to
a team of social workers
down in chinatown
thatll keep us informed
of any unusual movement
if anything happens
well know about it
hopefully well know
about it in time
christopher what about
my theory about the uh--
dont worry about it sam
even one of your
saber-toothed rats
wont get through
the net weve put up
music playing

now luke listen to me
tom may have been killed

down there and were going
down there to smoke them out
take it to court chris
i got enough proof right here
to tell me who did this number
and im going to fix it
now hold it luke
im telling you it
wasnt the chinese gangs
youre just going
to make things worse
by getting blood on your hands
like i said mister you
do it your legal white way
i know who did
this to my brother
and im going to fix
it and im going
to do what got to be done
i said no
i told you before
stay out of my life
music playing
gang member are you
out of your mind
where your leader
gang member none
of your business
then i want you
music playing
now before i punch your face
in i want to know just how
you killed my student rodan
what kind of rules do
you fight by cornering
rodan in the subway
i do not understand
your friends there they
stole cocaine from rodan
and now youve killed him
wait
there a rule among
us that we all must
fight to defend our brother
but if we had known that your
brother would dishonor any
of us we wouldnt have fought
they have caused two deaths
one of yours one of our own
they will be dealt with
however as for
rodan your brother
his death is not our doing
what do you mean
first you iced tom
then you cornered
rodan in the subway
no it was not us
then who
gang member come with me
it is time you
found out the truth
ill go with you but i
warn you if it a trick
ill get you first
horn sounding
he will help you
does this have something
to do with china
does it mr curtis
howd you know my name
because of this
luke the amulet of mendow
i told him to put it back
i thought it might be
sacred but why would
your people kill him for it
old man please mr
curtis let me continue
this amulet holds the
answer to all that
has happened in recent days
it was brought to me by a
number of the red dragons
unfortunately the killer must
have thought he still had it
that is why he is dead
you come 0000 miles and
to be foiled in a search
there still hope
it is amazing
i dont understand
2000 years ago
the sorcerer master
lung-ton would allow seven
men to be possessed by demons
and these he would use to
terrorize villages and cities
master chang-dao produced the
emerald in which he trapped
the spirit of the demon
this is the amulet
your friend took
from this the monster is
released into the world
as long as this amulet
exists  the demon
is deprived most of his power
even though he is still strong
he is unable to tolerate light
that is why your subways is a
perfect place for him to hide
in my head your story is
fantastic but in my heart
i know that you
speaking the truth
the demon will stop at
nothing to regain this amulet
by destroying it it
will be free forever
immortal and indestructible
in a way i feel
responsible for this
i chose rodan to go with
me in the first place
what must i do
you must wage the combat
our only chance is this amulet
challenge the demon
defeat him and we are saved
lose and the demon
will eat the soul
of the man who challenged him
the demon or try to
attack your mind
he can assume the forms
of those you love most
and those you fear most
it will use every
trick at its disposal
i shall try to help
in the only way i can
while you are fighting i
will place my mind with yours
perhaps together we will
be stronger than one alone
this is for those
rats underground
squeaking squeaking
squeaking squeaking yes
and then all of you
god is nobody fool
cant you see
luke this is the only
thing that can stop him
i know you cant buy it
i couldnt buy it either
that right i cant buy
it especially the part
about you going down there
i dont need any dead heroes
ive got four guys
to take care of that
chris you wont
be able to hit it
with anything that can stop it
as a matter of fact
youre going to be
picked off alone or together
if i dont make it
then you can in
spiritual leaders at best
moses is dead
mohamed is dead
buddha is dead
and im feeling so--
that my job
so for the last time
the answer no
christopher let go
ok

the interior of the crypt
is three meters
by three by 25 in height
it doesnt appear that
it been entered
it beautiful
it at least 900 years old
the detail is amazing
it is the story of creation
it is the story
of the birth of evil on earth
oh god larabe
it is the crypt
this is where the sanzia
have entombed the devil child
oh man
what a screw up
now well have some fun
is anybody here
who are you
are you crazy
what are you doing
you must stop this
everybody will be killed
if you do not stop this
what are you talking
about who are you
you brought their evil back
with your picks
and your shovels
close the tomb now and leave
the sanzias are dead
all of them are dead
he opened up the gate to hell
and the killings began
there will be others
the soul of the
sanzia child is alive
it has returned
all of the children
are in danger
close the tomb now
and maybe god will spare us
wait
wait
wait
wait for me
what was that about
superstition
there frequent opposition
to dredging up the past
a past descendants
of the sanzias
would prefer we left in secrecy
im looking for my son
he snuck out of the house
i thought he might
be here with you
jimmy my assistant
the explorer
no i havent seen him ha yet
what going on here
that it
im getting out of here
dad there a man in there
he dead
i saw him
jimmy stop it
calm down
calm down
stay here
luis
luis
luis
luis
hello
it an emergency
we need an ambulance
at camino el rey
looks like it was
a heart attack
under the circumstances
with luis
im not going to punish you
but what you did was
totally irresponsible
just what did you think you
were gonna do out there
i dont know
mr resnick mentioned
that old tribe
and i read all about them
how they were like
really weird dudes
they tried to make like
an evil kid or something
you know a devil
child they called it
sanzias were into
really scary stuff
it just got me going i guess
what did you say the
name of that tribe was
sanzia
from now on you
can forget about
some of the more exotic
goings-on around here
such as mr resnick and
the archeological digs
what
dad come on
the digs are a cool place
what does that have
to do with anything
it has to do with your ability
to separate what
real and what not
what are you doing
i thought that youd
be more comfortable
if dolly slept over
there in the chair
dont touch her
jessica im taking the doll
out of the bed
and i dont want hear
another word about it
ill kill you
ill kill you if you
try to separate us
ill kill you
she mine
she mine
whoa

daddy mommy trying to
take dolly away from me
dont take her daddy
calm down
i want my dolly

it the doll
it controlling her somehow
it doing something to her

what youre saying is
completely irrational
i want to get her out of here
im afraid for her
i want to take her back to la
marilyn weve
invested everything
into this factory
we cant just pack up
because our seven-year-old
is having a tantrum

shell be all right
just let her go
through some changes
youre not hearing
a word im saying
that man that man karl resnick
what do you know about the crypt
in the field
why is he so interested in it
he interested because
he an archeologist
what are you suggesting
i dont know
i dont know
im trying to make sense of it
camilla was frightened
of the sanzia
she said that jessica
spoke to her in their language
you told me yourself
camilla spent half the day
mumbling over burning candles
if jessica said anything
she heard it from her
no she didnt elliot
she heard it from someone
but it wasnt her
okay im sorry
im tired im hungry
it the middle of the night
and i dont want to
hear this right now
mr resnick im marilyn wade
oh happy to meet
you sefora wade
i see your beauty
in your son face
how is he
he had a rough night
it was an unfortunate
experience
yes it was
i wonder if i could talk to you
about these carvings down here
oh please
these
these were removed
from the tomb
yes
well actually theyre
portions of the damaged door
see the details are exquisite
these are very old
sanzia right
correct
our son tells us
these people have
a grisly history
what is it that
youre looking for
were looking for the remains
of the sanzia devil child
the legends say
the sanzia prepared a place
for the birth of satan child
they suckled a child
that was neither man nor beast
it had the body of an infant
and the head of a goat
they fed it with the warm blood
of slaughtered children
a child so evil that
its reign of terror
almost caused their extinction
before they put the creature
to its howling death
and you knew this before
you opened the crypt
sefora whatever
made the sanzia afraid
this child was not supernatural
how do you know it wasnt
because im a man of reason
it not possible
mr resnick my daughter
has been drawing these symbols
since we arrived here
our housekeeper camilla
told me that jessica
spoke sanzia to her
she tried to warn me
and now she dead
and so is the night watchman
and so is your archeologist
and my daughter is being
touched by something
by some outside force
sefior resnick
we need help with the machine
how much time
sefiora where are you going
camilla said she has a sister
in the convent
i want to speak with her
uh mom said you
should take a nap
um but that okay

im marilyn wade
i know who you are
im very sorry
about your sister

about my daughter

you put your faith
in your machines
your science
you ignore the powers
of heaven and hell
my sister tried to warn you
yes i know she did
but please tell me now
what is happening
to my daughter
how can i stop it
it too late
the spirit of the
sanzia devil child
has been set free
it too late
listen to me im
not losing my daughter
to a goddamn
900-year-old goat head
tell me what you know
how does this thing
this spirit work
could it could it
go into something
other than a human
could it go into a doll
the devil takes
any form it desires
it can be one
or it can be many
the sanzia devil
child wants children
it will do anything
to spread its word
to the children
through the dolls
i dont know what
course satan will travel
all i can do is pray
for their salvation
you see
it has begun
there will be no end
to its reign of fear
it fear that
keeps them ignorant
to believe that
malarkey is insanity
maybe it is maybe it is
i have a husband who
thinks it insanity
and im inclined
to agree with him
but i have a daughter at home

that the spirits
wander through these woods
they like to linger
in old barns
they visit you in your sleep
in your dreams
do you have bad dreams
cause a spirit trap
will catch em
listen shh
oh my goodness
they are in here right now
theyre trying
to tell you something
something very important
they are saying
buy ms ruth
wild berry jam
ahh come on
im just playing with him
okay come on
trail picks up
right over there
great thank you
yeah
hey hey hey
josh is that your name

you dont believe that stuff
about spirit traps do you
you know that nonsense
she said they were real
she said they catch your dreams
you know how dreams work
dont you
yeah they scare
the shit out of you
hey language
josh dreams dont come
from out here alright
they come from in here
it just your mind way
of figuring out stuff
that going on in your life
so if youre having
some bad dreams
it means youre probably dealing
with some stuff that difficult
and you could talk about it
you dont want to talk about it
you could try drawing it up
you know if you can see it
sometimes it makes it a little less scary
helps you understand it
and maybe you can figure it out
in your real life
does that make sense
i guess
i want to tell you
something this is a secret
youre in control
okay so when
youre falling asleep
just think good thoughts
about your mom
you know think about some of
the good times that you guys had
and i promise you
itll be better
okay

im in control
that right
say it a little bit louder
im in control
okay scream it

little noah
he was just
a regular little guy
he was smart funny
was a little bit quirky
he liked odd things
he had a collection that
he called his special stuff
that had dead animal fur
bones dead bugs
his father would say
get rid of that junk
normal boys play sports
and they have friends
i was his friend
it was christmas
and i wanted to find the perfect present
and there was a yard sale
down the street
and i found that thing
this crazy woman said to me
whoever hangs it in their room
will be protected
from evil forever
i thought the perfect present
boy was i wrong
protect him from evil
it was pure evil
it devoured him
and then one day he followed
his parents into the woods
and this little boy
hacked them to death
came upon them
all hacked to pieces
except for noah
suddenly he he just
leapt at me like a wild animal
and he was waving this axe
screaming at the top of his lungs
make it get out
make it get out
and then he killed josh mom
once upon a time
there was a boy named josh
and he had a hatchet
as a psychotherapist
i can tell you
that kids have issues alright
and using science
we just need to treat them
with therapy or with medicine
and this voodoo bullshit
it doesnt help
it doesnt help anyone
and im just suggesting
that you just drop it
gail help i cant move

man
all of us have wondered
what is love
music starts
man
love is
commitment
sharing your life
all of it
your fears and dreams
but
the more you share
the more you love
or the longer the relationship
the more you love
how do you rate
a good relationship
by moments
which ones
the happy ones
or perhaps by enduring
the sad ones
music continues
i hope you never stop loving me
hi
music continues
hello
where did you get wine
over there
would you have a glass
with me or seven
ok
im sebastián
valeria
sebastián why is it different
to fall in love
than to love somebody
music continues
to fall in love is simple
it about emotions
first times
the first date
the first touch
and the first kiss
cell phone rings
sebastián
what if we put it all together
the real and the virtual
three years ago
you started dating sebastiaán
sebastián if we put together
the laughter
the kisses
all the pictures we took
the ones we shared
and those that are private
and what about
the late-night conversations
the messages
the comments the posts
if we put together
all we shared
the movies the songs
i love you panda
more moments
equals a better relationship
the more information
we create
the more we love each other
perhaps
but in the real
or the virtual world
an action a word
one click
can delete everything
music continues
i got it when i met valeria
i had to go back to my mom
after going all in
and losing everything
and yes there were hard times
but we faced them together
and we would move forward
just the same
cell phone rings
new message

-to make love to her
son of a bitch
you know ive been
with over a thousand women
and ive never felt
the connection i had
sebastián
-hi mike
-mike
i was talking with alonso
there something wrong
with the platform
give me your mobile
what do you need it for
take it
what is it
let see
-show me
-that it
is that all
huh
the problem was your phone
when you downloaded the app
did you allow data sharing
no way that makes
me very nervous
what if someone accesses
my phone and hacks it
nobody wants to mike
that is necessary so the app
can use your mobile
internet connection
so in that case
i owe you an apology dont i
im sorry ok
can you imagine
what could have happened
if you hadnt invested
all your money
in your application
and spotify hadnt gotten
ahead of you
turocolapp with double p
exactly huh
you would be one of those
young billionaires now
laughs
come on truth is
at first i doubted hiring you

i doubt you have another chance
i know trust me
but i only love her
i love valeria my valeria
-so stop whining and find her
-where
she wont answer my calls
or answer my messages
i may know
where shell be tomorrow
what
jesús posted on facebook
theyd go to a concert
didnt he block you on facebook
yes but i created
a fake profile
with one of his fairy
friends picture
what
i miss him a lot man
-damn youre a genius
-what
where are you going
no way miss
were going
to this concert together
im not in the mood chucho
there are two options and we
didnt want to tell you but
either you let him go or
-you call him
-what
no way
god valeria
why are you so hard on him
he wasnt the only one who
-right
-im sorry for that
i hate you
music
well before we go on
ive a surprise for you
a very dear friend
asked me a favor
he has a very important message
for the girl he loves
thanks a lot rodrigo
valeria i know youre here
and we cant undo our mistakes
but i think we can
begin again always
hold me
i dont want to see you
disappear
forgive me
i didnt mean to hurt you
that time
we crashed
and burned unknowingly
against the break of day
and in a thousand pieces
on your skin i stayed
we uncovered ourselves
until we vanished
lost in the moment
i gave in
and when we forgot it
-hold on theyll see you
-i dont care faggot
we were born again
panda
would you marry me
caderas blancas playing
caderas blancas continues
yes i do
she said yes
valeria
so what is love
i dont know the precise words
to answer that
sebastián love is incredible
but it not perfect right
it wonderful
but oftentimes it not easy
valeria
love is everything
it indeed sharing
and commitment
sebastián but it also
to recognize we arent perfect
and we make mistakes
valeria to give yourself
completely and unconditionally
to take a leap of faith
despite the fear
sebastián love is
to face the world together
to forgive and begin again
valeria
for better
or for worse
caderas blancas continues
caderas blancas continues
caderas blancas continues
caderas blancas ends
music starts
music continues
music continues
music continues
music ends

got back from the dog park
you need to change her diaper
as soon as she poops dear
i was going to change
it before her nap
well why dont i just
change it for you now
i can change her
diaper mrs matthews
i hope you didnt take her
to that park on griffith street
it filled with homeless
i read in the paper
that they found
more than 2 homeless
people living there
filthy just filthy
and you know what they do
i dont know what they do
they leave trash everywhere
clothing tents
needles it disgusting
wow that really is something
i just think it would
be highly irresponsible
for you to take
her to that park
so a surprise visit huh
mm-hm im redecorating my
master bedroom and i will take
any excuse to visit my princess
what time is dinner
oh well luke doesnt
get back till later
and i was going to make
myself a salad and
well sage dear
that wont work
okay
you have a guest
you need to go to
the grocery store
and get something to prepare
i just got back from the
grocery store earlier
well good that means it
must not be very far away
okay well ill just
give jessee her bottle
and then be on my way
it almost four oclock
i can manage the bottle
it just if
i can handle it
well just be sure to
put her down afterwards
otherwise shell
be up all night
you have a
nice night ladies
youre the worst
it good to hear
you laugh again
it good to talk
about her again
how you doing
better i think
everything been i dont know
just blurry for so long
i wanted to be
there for you man
i shouldnt have
pushed you away
it was kinda selfish
i just didnt know
how to talk to you
i saw your texts and your calls
and i see you in the office
it just reminded me of jessica
weve both been there luke
in that room where
it goes wrong
but when it somebody you know
i really miss her too man
and i really miss
having you around
im sorry
youre a good doctor
i had it all planned out
a good girl a good
job a good life
and when it was yanked
away from me i just
i didnt feel worthy to
ever have that again
like it was my fault
and now
hey sometimes second chances
come in really weird ways
jessee definitely
my second chance
i bet having sage
around to help is a bit
of a breath of fresh air too
yeah more than you know
she so good with jessee
she cooks a mean steak
and most importantly
she doesnt put up with
katharyn attitude
what
what what that
nothing
shut up and drink your beer
this fish is interesting
it mahi mahi

what time did you say
luke was coming home
i didnt
well you do the dishes

for my sweet princess

to feed her a lot of sweets

we dont like to give
her a lot of sweets
i think you should let
me be the grandmother

your place to think
ive seen the way you
behave with this child
excuse me
it highly unprofessional
you walk around like you
belong in this family
mrs matthews
i know you lost your child
i talked to the dunhills
they said they had to let you
go because you were depressed
and unfit for the job

beautiful she was educated
she gave him a reason to
get serious about school
get his degree
im not following
i hated it
for the first time in his
life there was someone
who wasnt me that
made him happy
it was her that he
wanted to please
well
from the time luke dad
died for a long time after
it was just the two of us
i held onto him really tightly
and then to see this
woman take my place i
it broke my heart
is this going somewhere
the way ive treated you
has not been very polite
and i realized last night
that the reason ive
treated you that way
is because you remind me of her
you have become important
to the two people
that i care most
about in my life and
i was just worried that there
wouldnt be room for me
i dont know what to say
luke told me about
the man you were with
i wish id been there
i would have let
him know how we deal
with things like
that on the ranch
luke and jessee love you
and i lied about the dunhills
shocking
they were really
sorry to lose you
and they told that youd
become a part of the family
and that you used to take
the boys to ride horses
now why didnt you put
that on your resume
i dont know
well horses and i go
together like steak and sauce

yeah my whole life actually
mom wanted a sports star
how bout you
oh no sports for me
i was too punk for that
i was all about loud
music and horses
horses
that doesnt sound very punk
oh but barrel racing
is
it like the music
controlled chaos
hm must be a lot of space
to ride around in australia
you have no idea
it is so beautiful
hey
hi
just havin a party people
hey were thinking about
getting out of here
you guys interested
yeah there is this really
rad club down the street
yeah
is the club called disco dust
yes
i dont get it
uh
we should get inside
check on jessee
well michelle with jessee
and im sure she
asleep by now
we need to we should
just get inside you know
did i do something
what is it
i keep seeing her
who
jessica
if it would have been up to me
we would have lived in
that apartment forever
this whole house was
just her brainchild
being in the desert
made her feel
like we lived in the old west
she sounds really great
she was
when i first met her i was
always looking for the
next beer run party
she got me focused
pushed me to be a doctor
and i just assumed you
loved the female anatomy
sounds kinda cheesy but
i became an ob because
i just loved the idea
of being there when
a family starts
seeing that look
on a father face
when he first sees his child
or the relief a mother
has when you tell her
that she has a very
happy healthy baby
nothing quite like it
well dr matthews
you do have a soft
side under there
yeah somewhere under there
how bout you
all i know about you is
that you are an aussie
and you used to ride horses
every weekend
when i was a kid
my dad taught me to barrel race
and i loved it so much
that i started competing
like a real cowgirl
yes like a real cowgirl
hm
the summer i sold my
horses was really rough
my mum moved back
here to the states
and my dad stayed in adelaide
and he had to sell the
horses just to get by
and that was that
i buried myself in music
and my horses just
became a faded memory
so the cowgirl has a past
yeah
you dont have to
answer this but allen
yeah
girls like bad guys i guess
mm-hm
mm-hm i met him
back home at a show
when his band was doing
smaller opening acts
and at first i was just
another girl to him
then he made me feel special
dedicated songs to me onstage
winked at me during solos
i loved it
then i followed him to the
states when he got signed
and then he changed real quick
our late nights became
his late nights
he stopped sleeping on the
bus and disappeared a lot
then i got pregnant
yeah and he adopted
the rockstar lifestyle
yeah things became
too real he said
needed to work on
touring and his work
he said hed send me
money and id be set
until the other night
the last i saw him
or heard from him was
when the bus pulled out
and he headed east
why are men so horrible
let face it were jerks
well present company
excluded obviously
i left voicemails
and emails and texts
and im about three months along
and he tells me i
shouldnt call him anymore
im upsetting his artistic flow
such a load
you never wanted to show up
to one of his concerts
and call him out

hush-a-bye
dont you cry
go to sleep my little babies
when you wake
you will find
all the pretty little horses
the bees and the butterflies
mm mm mm
mm mm mm-mm-mm-mm
shh
the first guests will be here
in 0 minutes what are you doing
im hungry
well there is a helluva lot of party
pies and sausage rolls out there
you go and dig in
cleo
whatd she say
is it time
where the funeral dead body
bereavement assistant lady gone
yeah bianca
she said shed be back soon
i dont think we couldve done
these last few days without her
i dont think
we could have done anything
without that death doula
do you think mum knew
a natural home funeral
would be so much fucking work
how the eulogy going
yeah you want run anything
past us first
me
you dont want to say something
doesnt the oldest do it
oh youre the performer
hey i cant prepare a speech
in eight minutes
are you seriously
not saying anything
does it have to be me
ill do it
great
yeah that good
that makes sense
what do i say
all you have to do is just
think of some nice things
about mum
ok
nice things
ah like how shed always let me
have that special cereal on sundays
or like whenever she was
on the phone to you emma
and youd be talking about work
and shed say
stop it youre making me so proud
im gonna start lactating again
you remember that
but we cant make this speech
about us
this speech has to be about her
it doesnt even look like our mother
weve spent three days with this body
and i hardly see her there anymore
her hair
ah
some of her hair came off
ok
oh
emma it in my hand
im gonna vomit
it ok give that to me
just sit down
you um you keep thinking
about those nice things
just keep thinking about that eulogy
ill fix this
ah
yeah the nice things um
there was that time
that she broke my teacup set
and then every day after that
she would leave this peace offering
of a new cup out the front of the
i cant say that
she liked
what did mum even like
i still cant get used to it
the smell
the smell of decomposing body isnt
that bad when it someone you love
it been three days already
surely she should have been embalmed
or something
no embalming
is environmentally unsound
mum was very specific in her will
and after five days
the maximum you can keep me at home
without embalming or proper
refrigeration
you will cover me
with a shroud of your choosing
kitty will know
the one that i like
and bury my body under the gum
in the backyard
sorry
i still have no idea
which shroud she means
why are we even doing this
why are we trying this hard
to follow her instructions
i mean
do you think she knew it was
illegal to be buried in the backyard
why did she even request that
if she gets buried
in the backyard
she not getting buried
under the fucking gumtree eli
if she gets buried in the backyard
doesnt that mean geoff technically
owns the burial plot too
the man relinquished all his rights
when he murdered our mother
but if he gets off
he in prison he gets nothing
but if he got charged
with accidental death
the coroner was very clear kitty
but if he did get out
he not getting out
everything that was maude
is solely ours now
and were not burying her
in the backyard
we cant do everything she wants
wanted
but if she wanted to get buried
in the backyard
doesnt that mean
she didnt want to sell the house
so if we sell the house
is that
bad
maybe she just didnt get
around to updating her will
maybe she didnt want
any of this anymore
well it does say um
during this time
family and friends should come
round to our beautiful house
for an afternoon
to be able to view my body
and for a wonderful celebration
to say a final farewell
there liquid dripping
from the bed
our beautiful house
that sounds like
she wanted to keep it
eulogy
liquid
what
there a great big puddle
is it the icepacks
tell me it just melted icepacks
oh she leaking
oh fuck
oh my god that smell
how is that even possible
surely the coroner had to deal
with that stuff
the coroner doesnt prepare anything
eli
the coroner just released maude
to us and me and kitty
and bianca the death doula
did all the body preparation
as per mum wishes
no thank you to you eli
well she not going to care now
is she can we just wait
bianca will be back in a minute
well clearly not because
she shouldve been here already
now people are arriving
so maybe we can we just
figure this out ourselves
tampons
are you serious
no no bianca said you could
use tampons for something like this
one of you get out your tampons
well i dont have any
what do you mean
you dont have any tampons
i thought i was only gonna be
in adelaide for a couple of days
kitty do you have any
i dont know
i moved out remember
kitty think
would mum have any in here
i have no idea
um
surely our mother wouldve gone
through menopause by now
surely
god i dont even know if our mother
went through menopause or not
this is gonna be the worst speech
whatever you say kitty
will be perfect
just get something down on paper
maybe
found some
super tampons perfect
how old do you think they are
does it matter
it doesnt matter kitty eulogy
i dont know what to say about her
there a present here for me
despite eli and i having birthdays
two days apart
she never made us
share the same birthday party
fuck
no that great just keep going
no we cant make this about us
this one got an auto-tuner on it
maybe why dont you just think
of a funny story
what like when mum started leaking
eli pass me another tampon
kitty a tampon
i remember when mum tried to teach
me how to put in a tampon
for the first time and
i was really nervous
mum
no
just letting you know
folks have started rocking up
yeah just some last-minute touches
cleo just wants to have a moment
before everyone else comes in
mm-hm
youre messing up her hair
i know toby
emma let me help
no stop no no no fixing from you
as you can see were just
were not quite ready
so maybe if you two could come back
in a second
i just want a moment
yeah
i get it but we just need some
time with our mum first darling
i just wanted to give this to her
dont take another step
no more yelling
im sorry for the yelling
but stay over there
what the hell
please just go
what wrong
i havent had a moment
i understand
can somebody please take her
out of here
the bees and the butterflies
fluttering round your eyes
go to sleep little baby
when you wake you will find
all the pretty little horses
how black and bay
dappled and grey
go to sleep little baby
when you wake you will find
all the pretty little horses
go to sleep little baby
de bees and dem butterflies
peckin out its eyes
oh my poor little baby
it wasnt that version
oh it was a slave song
it a mother singing about
her own child not being cared for
while she sings for the owner baby
that doesnt make sense
why would mum sing that
you guys ready
got lots of people out here
you ok
whoa
i dont know how that got there
kitty kitty kitty
ah hi everyone
um thank you so much
for coming today to celebrate maude
um
i dont quite know
how to start this but um
ah
um we didnt want to make
this speech just about us
and i didnt want to make it
about him and what he did
and um
but all i can think of
is that maude loves us
loved us
im sorry i never cry
kitty kitty kitty
sorry
um
one time i came back early
and i didnt tell mum
i wanted to surprise her
i had prepared a big speech
about how well i was doing in sydney
how great my life was
since i last saw her
how proud shed be of me
ah so i came around the back
to just where you are standing now
and i spotted her
she was right
just right there
and she was smoking a joint
and she seemed so happy
and content just
smoking by herself
i didnt know she smoked
did you know
did you know
did any of you know
yeah
none of us knew
why didnt she want us to know
so i walked back around
to the front of the house
and knocked on the door
surprise
and she was surprised
and she was really proud of me
and everything id been doing
this isnt fair
because i always told maude
that i would only come back to
adelaide for christmases and funerals
and now i havent broken that pledge
maybe i shouldve a long time ago
maybe we all could have had
a joint together
maybe we still can
maybe ill stick around
so can i make one final suggestion
can we go look for maude stash
i wont be a winner
yeah
and you wont be a winner
you can just tell
you can just tell you can just tell
that ill never make it
you can just tell
you can just tell
that ill never make it
you can just tell
you can just tell
that well never make it

oh thanks
so do you like it
i didnt know this place

i thought this was just
an abandoned factory

you mean
this is illegal
that the whole point
we firmly believe that drinking and dancing
require no permission by
any kinds or authorities
it so unbelievably cool
i know right
i want selfie
over here
well arent we awesome
this is the best party ive ever been to
actually this is mass market
we keep the best for ourselves
what do we keep
the best of the best of the best
we dont have anything
well the girls are local
they can help
what do you need
well the thing is we like to pay
visits
visits to very special
places with no hosts
you want to break into someone house
nothing bad just a house party
we dont steal and we clean up afterwards
but we need a special house
like the one on the beach
where you worked in over the summer
sasha told us everything already
this is not up for discussion
you couldnt keep your mouth shut
but it a perfect option
your mysterious prince
left long ago anyway
and you know the place
i said no
katya you brought us
to his house yourself
you have a problem and
it needs to be fixed
how exactly by going to that house
great idea
not just going katya going with vadik
scientists have proven that
repressing bad memories is good
katya when are you gonna
stop torturing yourself
you like that vadik do you
you do
first time you even look at someone else
youre smiling again so give it a chance
crimean gothic in all its beauty
wow
cool
id like to remind you
not to post anything
why
do you want us to get busted
so who is the owner
he an architect
he pretty well off that architect
yeah
it the bottom lock
they never used the top one
wait you said he lives there alone
they died
his wife and kid
here
no in a car crash
well to quote a classic
the beauty of country
life is in its informality
brilliant
that a neat place
look at the fireplace
shall we start it
sure
sorry
one hell of a place but if you ask me
there a little much of this
atmospheric decrepitude
and one of the doors doesnt open
probably stuck
it damp
maybe let blow
there no draft
maybe there a heater
sorry
im just looking for a heater
they should be under the stairs
thanks
i say
put it back now
you know the rules
what that book
a study of demonic entities
nikolai karlovich von grubbe
that our house
that quite a freak show
this part is awesome
all the sketches presented in the book
were made by the author during his
visionary revelations
like they were posing
what were they smoking back then
great question
you think her majesty will
deign to enter the kitchen
or does she think she
hired free waitresses
you just want her boyfriend
you know your fairy-tale
castle is in decay
there mold everywhere
that our dining room
yeah
the baron in the middle
let me
baron von grubbe a famous
philologist and mystic
in the early 20th century
his country house was known
as the biggest spiritualist salon
of the crimean riviera
he claimed that the devil himself
showed him the dwellers of hell
let me have a look
died at a psychiatric hospital in berlin
damn
i almost believed it here
who is this dude
i know him
it alexander blok idiot
nikita nikita
listen
the best people of that
time summoned spirits here
why shouldnt we
we are also the best people
seriously
a spiritualist seance
it all pretty clear

we broke into his house

this is the owner and they had an affair
it not like that and
and none of this even matters
holy crap
wait something going on in this house
it not normal the way
everything falling apart
and the cellar with andrey
i dont know how to explain it
it called a neglected house
and your andrey is a psycho
katya are you saying that the guy

this conversation over
i came here to have fun

katya
the subscriber is not available now

can someone explain to me what going on
god damn
you dont understand
theyre gonna kill andrey
theyre gonna kill him
calm down easy
it okay easy easy
i couldnt reach polina
not now
there another car
dont look
get out of the car
into the house
this isnt gonna help
we need more fire
they dont like fire
first thing they did was clog the chimney
you know them well
well enough
what are those creeps
vadik stop it
he knew about them from the start
and now everyone dead
theyre dead
no one invited you here
why are you still alive
because i brought them here
now listen to me
your only chance is to stay here
where it warm
and burn anything you can find
you leave in the morning
when they are not so dangerous
wanna help
get enough firewood
so they are
phantoms
demons
who assumed the shape of my wife and son
monsters from another world
so all of that is real
you still have doubts
he studied hell
he found the door and left it open
when i bought the house
i didnt believe it either
what do they want
only me
you presented a danger to me
so they started killing you
keep it we need to make a torch
did they kill before us
my friend tried to take me away
i didnt know their ways back then
after that i locked the house
isolated myself from the world
and learned how to live with them
only i hadnt anticipated you
keep the fire burning
you can leave in the morning
andrey wait
im gonna make some tea
mommy
you wanna spin
come
let me spin you
hurray
how many times more i am dizzy
andrey
pass the ball
hit hit hit
great job come on come on come on
come on come on come on
you shouldnt have followed me
i couldve held them off till morning
what was that
these monsters
exist at the cost of those who let them in
feeding on their pain
but giving something in return
to me they give an illusion
that my family is still alive
only i lose them
every time
again and again
back then in the summer
they were here
i was going insane
praying for things to go back to normal
and i was heard
i started having dreams
very real dreams
that how they kept me from forgetting
then came the dampness
and then they came
standing there watching
as if saying
let us in
and well always stay with you
at some point i couldnt resist anymore
and allowed them in
the dreams started lasting for days
and then i woke up
and saw their
real faces
and realized that i invited monsters
you never tried to run
i didnt want to
damn
katya
no
no
andrey
katya no
sasha
where sasha
we need to try to start the fire again
theyre gonna kill us anyway
they wont touch him it about us
theyre gonna just keep killing
am i wrong
vadik what are you doing
he said it they depend only on him
he goes they go with him
give me another idea
there is none
lower the gun
katya he right
i brought them here
they will leave with me
katya no

crunching
route permutations
on daedalus
patch me through

all right well be using
a mersenne prime algorithm
that makes shadow tracking
that much more difficult
elkert will get
a handheld unit
with an encrypted
flash-memory card
hell have more than
50 links along the way
well need
all our resources
call on the least-used providers
in the nsa system
providers who wont even know
what it all about
but are looking
for a trigger code
a break in the chain
an infiltrator that needs
to be disposed of
if there is a match
he gives up a new envelope
hell get
birth certificates
passports subscriptions
then on to the next link
ive run
the provider list
but there are 2
noted as unknown
that our ace
in the hole
something ive been saving
for a rainy day
static drops
providers who
cant give up information
even if they wanted to
if you remove
the human element
there can be no betrayal
he must enter
the correct code here
or he dies
if he gets through
without mistakes
his trail will forever
be erased
hell be a ghost
i ought to install
a revolving door
you boys
got reservations
shut up
i told you id be back
to see you real soon
now we can do this
the easy way
or we can do this
the hard way
this pillow talk sam
if you think
youre gonna try
relax
im not gonna interfere
but i got an interest
really what that
let just say price
tricked us too
elkert so deep
we cant even
track him
now i wanna
talk to him
yeah well
i want the skinny
on price and his people
hey buddy
sonny
i tried to warn you

elkert still alive
i might not be
though
jason price
fbi academy 8
top of his class
youngest special
protection agent
in division history
8 commendations
including
a presidential citation
but was suspended twice
for insubordination
what do i look like
an idiot
i know all this shit
gimme the post-bureau stuff
icarus knows
i was a plant
the cleaner been
contracted to whack me
jesus sonny
do i have stupid
written on my forehead
look wiretap
on yoesky phone
conversation took
place this morning
with the cleaner
find him and while
youre at it
there another haircut
i want you to schedule
the cleaner filtered
we already discussed
that
his type is usually
not a mark
ill double
the fee just do it
we picked him up right after
the second suspension
put his skills to use
in east germany
with nsa funding
he devised
the most sophisticated
protection system
in the world
called daedalus
it was used for
hiding western agents
who had been exposed
never lost a runner
but when the wall
came down
the usefulness
of the program
came into question
so price made a deal with
the nsa and went private
son of a bitch
what about
his people
that information
is beyond even
my clearance
i dont know what the hell
you want me to do
yes you do
youre fbi sonny
im not touching this
you would give
a scumbag like elkert
a fighting chance
you wont even help
your best friend
how could you put me
in this position
because i dont have
a fucking choice
you know how screwed up
the fbi is
i mean hell
your own kid charlie
just hacked the system
last month
and he e-mailed
the director a list
of protected witnesses
just to piss him off
the fucking system
is a joke
please i got
nowhere else to turn
so you know where all
the guys are he stashed
you wanna find elkert
or dont you
rival agencies
sharing
a private moment
how touching
what happened
to elkert price
what happened
to i dont ask
you dont ask frank
that only
works one way
well then it my way
you have a good thing
going here price
i wouldnt spoil it

a lot more to lose
fuck you
i designed daedalus
so if you wanna
play hardball
remember this
the only losers
will be the marks
i ran under for you

no
i just think that
on a need-to-know
basis
there some pretty
important people
whod rather
not be known
he free to go

we had a deal
we had an understanding
i changed my mind
agency prerogative
this is fuckin
blackmail

give me
your provider kit
if i find out you lied
ill be back
and it aint
gonna be for tv
unh
yeah jason it me
go ahead charlie
there some
good news and
there some bad news
first the good
daedalus
extrapolation couldnt
pinpoint a hole
the codes received
were all in order
no penetration
charlie he knew
sonny was going there
but dont tell me
he couldnt have
cracked the system
anything is possible
sonny wasnt supposed
to be in virginia
the code should
have directed him
to south dakota
where hed link and
wait wait
south dakota
yeah kevin checking
all the transpo routes
but so far
there no redirect
in the database
for arlington
that doesnt make sense
unless
unless what
sonny
he figured it out
ill check
the back door
be careful
let go of me
who the hell are you
if youd get off of me
id tell you you jerk
i thought you were
with the fbi or icarus
dont sweet-talk me
what your name
renee brooks
i was one
of paul elkert
associates at icarus
the cleaner
tried to kill me
at the courthouse
but i got the hell out
howd you manage that
i was in the bathroom
i heard gunshots
so i climbed
through the window
as fast as i could
still doesnt explain
what youre doin here
are you always
this sympathetic
no wonder
you and elkert
got along so well
howd you know
about me and elkert
he told me he was
coming to see you
and that
i should too
because i got this
what is it
it a key to
a safety-deposit box
in the caribbean
worth $00 million
do you expect
me to believe
that elkert would
hand you a key
to money he stole
he trusted me
i took care of his
finances at icarus
besides the bank
requires 2 keys
why would
he hand one to you
he didnt have a choice
he keeps one with him
the other one was
in his safe at icarus
when the fbi raid
went down
i grabbed
what was inside
and now youre
gonna get it to him
no doubt for a price
0% is my standard
safekeeping fee
when did you
last talk to him
the day of the hit
i was supposed
to come to you
after he was
safely hidden
but you
werent around
and why should
i lead you to elkert
for the money
he owes you
what if i dont
hell contact
me anyway
ill just
have to wait
you dont really buy
that phony story
of course not
but there a link
to elkert there
we need to keep
her close
in case he does
contact her
i dont see why
the cleaner
is inside going after
our biggest fish
and that means the fbi
has a shot at him
it also means all
our people are exposed
i need to put
a stop to this
before someone else
gets hurt
so
i havent decided yet
where your car
got a rental
she your girlfriend
what it to you
just wondering why
she doesnt like me
like got nothin
to do with it
it trust she thin on
i think it you
who lacking
maybe but i want
the truth
and i dont think
im getting it
you ok
that truthful enough
for you
tell me more about elkert
what you did for him
i set up shell companies
that billed icarus
for services in
out-of-the-way places
like africa
and the middle east
trouble spots
places no one would
go check
it worked
for a long time
then he got reckless
kept wanting more
taking bigger risks
greed
control
he was consolidating
power and assets
to challenge yoesky
what happened
sonny
he was playing
both sides
against each other
setting icarus up
for the fbi
when did elkert find out
not until it was
too late
sonny lured elkert
with a billion-dollar
weapons buy
involving 4 countries
the feds were waiting
elkert was floored
he trusted sonny
like his own
he made everyone
look bad
so that why yoesky
put the hit out
and the cleaner
what do you mean
you were on the inside
you must have heard stories
just a killer
expensive never misses
no one knows who it is
that a stock answer
i was hoping for an idea
of who im dealing with
i couldnt tell you
who it is
but ill tell you this
i think the cleaner
looking for a way out
what makes you say that
because it
what happens
when you work
for the mob
you do things you
dont really want to do
just so you can believe
youre actually getting
somewhere
when in fact
youre only biding time
until you can no longer
do what they ask
and then
youre eliminated
kind of sounds
like an excuse
maybe but it happens
to everyone
elkert sonny me
itll happen
to the cleaner
do you um
have a rest room
through there
thank you
hello
kev listen
i need you to call charlie
on the secure line
i want the two of you
to gather all statistical data
on sonny run
specifically
route corridors phone calls
bank charges
credit card bills
whatever
im looking
for anything abnormal
thatll confirm my suspicion
which is
if the cleaner
was on the inside
how come he was
a step behind sonny
he isnt he got him
not where he was
supposed to be
that what not right
about this
something fishy
ok im on it
shh
what is it
there someone outside
go upgo upstairs go
fbi everybody freeze
price we know
youre in there
we know she with you
price we got a warrant
exit plan
somebody break a window
theyre gone
i think were safe
you dont really
need protection do you
that was some job
you did on that agent
whered you learn
to fight like that
when you work for icarus
youd better be ready
come in
theyre gonna start
coming down hard now
did kevin talk
to charlie
they ran the matrix
there something
what
he said you should
see it for yourself
do you mind if
i leave her with you
no way
no way
now listen both of you
in case you
havent noticed
we got a big problem
here
i need to go
and see charlie
and i cant take
either of you
so can we be adults
for 2 seconds here
thank you
just take her
to the safe house
and wait for me there
so whatd you
want me to see
while cross-checking
through some
975 million calls
made during sonny run
we came up
with a remarkable
coincidence
the provider at every
one of sonny stops
received a call within
an hour of his arrival
well how could that be
it cant i mean
one of the providers
is fisherman
in bar harbor
who hadnt had a call
on the secure line
for the last 2 years
and that was
a wrong number
all right
guess we gotta
bring elkert in
i thought there was
no way to trace him
think i tell you everything
well this is
um interesting
it safe
that all that matters
so how long
you and price
known each other
long enough
for what
to know when he not
thinking clearly
you always
warm up to everyone
this quickly connie
it takes a lot more than
the damsel-in-distress routine
to sell me
well lucky for me
it him who buying
ill take
the bedroom
thank you
good night
reverse the factor
by the 29th marsenne prime
match your beta code
sending these codes
could expose
the providers
and their locations
you sure you want
to do this
we got no choice
continue
well
i wonder if
the runners ever knew
they were leaving
a dna trail behind
by rubbing off
those gold patches
doesnt matter now
yeah
so you found the remote
that bombed her car
in her purse
man that is fucked up
hey
sorry
well it sounds to me
she after all the money
yeah
well then why
keep her around
well i need her
at arm length
and there
another possibility
what that
she not who
she says she is
think we hit a static drop
let me do it
the static drop coordinates
a back door
next card
not coming up
he didnt use it
he jumped track on his own
that what he planned
all along
yeah well then
he could be anywhere
back up
to the previous provider
what did he give elkert
plane tickets
ok match that provider
with all tickets
ever issued to him
2 hits
phoenix and boston
ids
no
but there are 2 high
probability addresses
for those areas
but i cant tell
if theyre providers
or final covers
ok call kevin tell him
ill pick him up in an hour
ok
well at least you two
didnt strangle each other
spare the chitchat
did you find him
no but therere
2 possibilities
in other words
he lost
he broke protocol
jumped track
but there
still a chance
if we move
what do we do
we split up
kevin already
arranged flights
you and him
hit phoenix
well go to boston
we
come on let go
how well did you
know sonny
not real well
and only for about 2 months
i was the last one
brought into the circle
by elkert
and he trusted you
it why he trusted me
i had no allegiance
to anyone else
howd sonny manage
to fit in
it wasnt so hard
he had more mob in him
than a lot of made men
sonny no way
he may have been fbi
but he loved
the high-flying lifestyle
the syndicate afforded him
houses boats
personal well-hidden assets
in countries the government
cant touch
nonsense
i set it up for him
ok i dont want
to hear anymore
how long did you know sonny
since we were kids
we were orphans
in social services
together
grew up
in the same streets
same foster homes
eventually joined
the fbi together
so if you happen
to run into the cleaner
during all this
what will you do
ill ask him
to walk away
leave my runners
alone
and if he doesnt
ill kill him
or her
come on
what
why
were being followedby who
someone who
doesnt really know
what a bottle of ripple
can do to you
are you ok
yeah fine
price
gimme your hand
come on
come on
big baby
thanks
well you know
one back scrubs the other
speaking of which i
i think im gonna
take a shower
everything ok
yeah why
well youre looking at me
like i have nothing on
this is nice
who this from
used to belong
to sonny
what is it
i need you to wait here
why where are you going
if im right
to meet sonny killer
hello
charlie it me
the boston address
is a static drop
anything from connie
she still in the air
ok call me when she lands
but i think hers
is a dead end
what makes you say that
faith
aah unh
jason it me
sonny
what the hell
get up
let me explain
shut up man
shut up
i knew i was being tracked
just couldnt figure out how
what the hell going on
i faked my own death
with the dental work
i scattered some teeth
behind
what the hell
is wrong with you
i helped you
i know man
i fucked up
no shit
whyd you do it
it fuckin turgenson
he after the money
he knew about some perks
i took from icarus
he told me hed nail me
if i didnt do it
do what
penetrate your system
why
if you were convinced
that the cleaner
whacked me
youd think the cleaner
was inside
and getting close
youd have no choice
but to go back
to elkert save him
and then i would
fuckin follow you
and i would deliver him
to turgenson
you killed those providers
no i didnt do that
that was turgenson
he killed em
after each pickup
i had no idea i swear
i knew something stank
about your death
fuck man
the pressure is huge
my sources
are telling me
that the cleaner
close
your sources
who are they
i mean
who are you really
it me man
who the cleaneri dont know
yes you do
fuck
it the cleaner
he doesnt give
a rat ass about you
those are yoesky thugs
come on
get your gun
make sure you leave
no trace of him
get down move
let go
jesus ok what now
jump
jump
you bastardjump
room 56
whend she leave
about an hour ago
she make any calls
seattle
you have reached the mailbox
of renee brooks
please leave a message
after the tone
so what was it
it how elkert
or somebody contacted her
who
all right where do we
go from here
you go with me
im gonna have
a little talk with elkert
after all
that gone down
why are you dragging
sonny along
he my prime suspect
the way to find
elkert is through
a safety-deposit box
it has to be registered
in his name at a bank
jeez we dont
even know which one
im not exactly
a specialist
in bank systems
well
i know someone who is
time to recall
another runner kid
and that
where we are
i need to put
your knowledge of
bank systems to use
what are we looking for
a
safe-deposit box
and its owner
paul elkert
what bank
that we dont know
caribbean somewhere
shit
that many
cayman islands alone
have 034
0000 banks
that 0 million accounts
all with passwords
renee
hid assets with you
in the caribbean
so
ill bet she used
the same bank
for elkert
for control
what was it
aruba
banco financiero di aruba
it a hit
but no personal info
just an e-mail
can we use it
isp out of canada
could use the ac program
i once wrote
e-mail the account
and attach trojan virus
hack their billing database
but it might
easily get traced
you might
not be the only one
nsa fbi you name it
anyone might
get this info
dont worry
anything happens
ill take care
of you
something
on your mind
just wondering
what gonna happen
my guess would be
someone gonna die
all right
what do we do
we go in
what kind of fuckin
plan is that
it the only one
i got
let go
fuck
get down
ok ill take
the back
look
for a way in
dont betray me
again sonny
elkert it price
what do you want
im here to help you
your life in danger
you never should
have come here
stop shooting
it me renee
renee what are
you doing here
she gonna
kill you elkert
shut up sonny
god damn it
who else you got here
how about the cleaner
elkert
the cleaner
what the fuck
you talkin about
take your pick
either one
fuck you
elkert
elkert
kill em
kill em all
sonny
im so sorry
sonny
unh
elkert
stay away from me
price
take it easy
im here to help you
bullshit
you led them all
straight to me
you called renee
why the fuck
would i call that bitch
she had
your second key
i dont need a second key
that safety-deposit box
is in my name
you only need a second key
if youre not me
hold on
the cleaner been
after this key for
cleaner doesnt exist
price
you said
i just mentioned him
so youd help me
yoesky invented the cleaner
to scare people
shitless that all
well how about
the courthouse hit
sonny set that up
for me
i made sonny
a rich man
he owed me big-time
yeah sonny
think about it price
who else
but a government agency
would know the exact time
location and the layout
of a secret grand jury hearing
stop shooting
i can get you out
im the last chance
you got
i dont need
your help price
fuck you
if youre gonna
get any of my money
you
but i trusted you
you expect me
to believe
she shot elkert
to save you
that right
horseshit
im gonna tear
your story apart
like you did
to my providers
you murderer
i dont know
what the hell
youre talking about
they were innocent
nobody innocent
price
drop it
turgenson drop it
place him under arrest
cant arrest me
im fbi
youre wanted
on 5 counts of murder
in the first degree
get him outta here
i warned you
this case could go bad
why did the nsa
want elkert dead
you picked up on that
not so hard considering
your panicked reaction
when i ran him under
elkert was too hot
we have certain
jurisdictional rights
but we couldnt
seize him from the fbi
without raising
a red flag
so you had him come to me
we thought
wed track him
quietly but
we werent expecting
your static drops
very clever
so you were working
with icarus all along
the mega arms deal
sonny got involved with
only the nsa
had the interest
and resources
to set that up
so you were
using the syndicate
to illegally divert weapons
to some dirty little war
somewhere right
that what
elkert had on you
that what
you didnt want
the fbi to know
you dont
have to worry
about that now
icarus
has pulled out
your actions
have torpedoed
important
national operations
and objectives
bullshit
was she your cleaner
does it matter
no
i guess this is one time
when there no
need-to-know on my part
well you
take care of yourself
price
thank you
and ive arranged
with the nsa
for a 5-million wire transfer
to each of your accounts
whoa
powell agreed to that
if i shut daedalus down
forever
i did explain
the potential downside
of having
a motley crew like
you guys running it
thanks
look after yourself
will ya
hey
hey
who gonna
mother me now
ill send you
monthly e-mails
yeah yeah
so what do we do
to get you under
nothing
this one
my own doing
the ultimate
vanishing act
yeah
ill miss you guys
how can you just
disappear on us
like this
it the only way
i can leave it
all behind connie
i guess things never did
settle right for us
everything ok
you
fine
free as a bird
so where are we
going
if i told you
we wouldnt be safe

with the build
lord knows the need is great
you want to join me on a coffee
run

mud

house
you do this and youre gonna
have to swing a hammer

hey i know you left cali to
start over
but dont be so focused on the
work
be more open from moving on from
rachel
i dont get involved with people
who volunteer for me
you know this

like when you see someone from
across the room and
suddenly nothing else even
matters
that ridicul
you were saying
come on we need to get started
you know i dont know her that
well
but by the way shelby talks
id say she more into hunting
guys than building homes
doesnt mean she cant
volunteer
dude im just saying be
careful
because she clearly
into you
look there nothing id like
more than to meet someone
but volunteer or not this girl
is way out of my league

framing your house is an
ambitious yet exciting project
and since the frame is the
skeleton
or the backbone of your
house
supporting the entire
structure you will need to use
the proper tools and materials
the tools you will have to have
on hand are saw horses
hand saws power saws chalk
lines hammers and nail guns

god is never gonna give you more
than you can handle
okay

here for me
your adornment must not be
merely external
braiding the hair and wearing
gold jewelry
or putting on dresses

of the heart
with the imperishable quality of
a gentle and quiet spirit
which is precious in the sight
of god
hey

week

coincidence

watching over you
i have ingredients for a mocha

coffee
yeah
okay
i like old houses
good opportunity to make
improvements
have you always lived here

they all live in california
oh so whyd you move here
mostly this job they needed a
director i was available
mostly hmm
why were you available
come on
really
okay i was in a relationship
the plot thickens
but my leaving was a good thing
for both of us
oh so that all youre gonna
tell me
yep
youre kind of mysterious
sometimes
youre kind of a flirt
sometimes
moi
yeah
her name rachel
we were engaged
it wasnt long before we
realized
we wanted different things
like what
i found faith and she found a
reason to dump me
so that was a deal breaker
i probably should get going
oh okay
you know im sort of new to
this whole faith thing
yeah i know
oh
when i was offered the job
id only been going to church
for a couple of months
oh wow
what that for
i dont know im just trying to
figure you out
yeah im still trying to figure
me out
believe me i was trying to
belong
act like everyone around me
total fake i mean who does
that
yeah who does that
i finally settled into my own
relationship with god
and it turns out i dont have to
pretend with him
well i gotta go watch joy
kids so ill see you around
hey
shelby keeps talking about some
concert it on saturday

my thing with him on saturday

jason
no i cant blow off my date
with ron
it never bothered you before
to cancel for a better offer
what going on
i dont know
i feel like i dont even know
who i am anymore

to find out
if there a chance with jason
dont mess it up
dont be afraid of a real
relationship
youre not yourself today is
everything okay
hi shelby
hi your usual

hey victoria
hey
umm do you want to grab a
table
actually i cant stay i just
came to say hi
hey victoria

the other end with shelby
im not here for coffee

my phone calls
look im just hear to touch
base about
saturday very important
to me
i know
i assume youll be ready
these are for you replace the
others
thank you
ill see you saturday
jason hey
i forgot okay it was an honest
mistake
i was just so excited that you
asked me
i shouldve listed to chris
chris what did chris say
you really want to know he
warned me off of you
that not fair look i wanted
to go out with you
ive been trying to get you to
ask me out
oh so that it you got what
you wanted
i guess you won huh
it not like that
i double booked myself and i
never do that
do you hear yourself right now
im not into being strung along
can you just wait a second
fine tell me why you
volunteered
i volunteered because i wanted
to get to know you
and i wanted you to like me
so i pretended to be a
christian
were you pretending to care when
i opened up about rachel
of course not
do me a favor just stay away
what up bro
you were right about victoria
oh man im sorry
hey you gonna tell me what
going on
about what
youve been avoiding jason like
he the plague
look we need to talk
obviously
i havent been completely honest
with you about who i am
im not really a christian
wait then why would you tell me
you were
i dunno it complicated but
mostly
when i got to know you guys i
wanted you to like me
victoria if you want people to
like you
you let them get to know the
real you
im not trying to start
anything i just
i cant believe i listened to
you
you had me trick wyatt into
liking me
but that not who i am
and now he thinks im just some
kind of weirdo
and you know what christian or
not
i still would have been your
friend
hey there
rachel
how did you know where
i called your mom
and i texted chris a few times
but he well chris
i dont think he likes me very
much
so this is what youve been
working on huh
the whole flight up i was
rehearsing what i was gonna say
now that i look at you i
just
ive missed you
look rach
jason tell me you dont miss me
too
of course i do
but weve been down this road
were different people
so we dont believe exactly the
same things so what
my faith is the most important
part of who i am
it is who i am
i can go along with it
i dont want you to just go
along
im willing to do whatever it
takes i just want you back
that not how faith works
youre not being fair

we make a choice
to love each other prefer one
another

choice
she ready to make it work

hey hey everybody werent

we come to my favorite time of
this evening
especially after that
performance
and i dont want to miss an
opportunity
to celebrate with anyone who
accepted jesus tonight
so who brave enough to come
on up here
and share about it share their
testimony
yeah come on up young lady
what are you doing
what a testimony
your story but
yeah i see you come on up
come on
no
youve made it this far wed
love to hear your testimony
come on dont be shy now
umm hi everyone
oh whoa
sorry umm im a bit of a mess
i was not planning on coming
here tonight
hence the awkward gown
but i want to be here with my
friends
the ones who think im shallow
and i agree with them
ive only known superficial
relationships
i mean theyre safer they dont
cost me anything
and i can protect myself from
being hurt
a few weeks ago i met a guy a
really great guy
and me being me
i went after him pretending to
be someone im not
in order to get him to notice
me i volunteered
with this christian organization
that he works with
and it was wrong i mean this is
his ministry his passion
and i treated it like it was a
game
nothing is worth hurting the
ones that you love
that you care about
but while i was pretending to
know what i was doing
i actually started serving
putting other people ahead of
myself
and that was a first trust me
but it felt good
and i dont know the best part
about all of this is that
while i was pretending to be
like him a christian
i was actually learning how to
be one
when i took the focus off myself
and i stopped being so
selfish
i opened up to wanting to know
god and who he thinks i am
and then suddenly this whole
christian thing
it just it made sense and it
got real
so im here tonight to share my
story
i dont want to be the old me
i want to be someone that
pleases god
and considers others while
finding out who i truly am
so to all my friends
im so sorry and i hope youll
forgive me
wow what a great start

he used your brother
barl created a spell
to get a gemstone
that would create an army
wait what gemstone
from the stories
from our history
the battle between orcs
and elves 000 years ago
rolf knows where it is
impossible
he said he was the descendant
of the general orc
that fought in the final battle
secrets were passed to him
from generation to generation
wait a minute
rolf is related to shark tooth
mm-hmm
so if he has the stone
then no one is safe
legend has it that orcs became
0 times their normal size
and all of them were
controlled by
general sharp tooth

ive read every book
in this library
but i cant find a story
about a girl like me
girls in books
always have a moment
where everything changes
but my moment
still hasnt happened
today is like yesterday
tomorrow never comes
i know what usually starts
an adventure
the arrival
of a mysterious hero
a mr darcy a mr rochester
a rhett butler
who turns everything
upside down
i am not closed-minded
but finding the romantic hero
of our age in wolverhampton
seems unlikely
upbeat music
laughing
riding on any wave
that is the luck you crave
they dont believe it now
they just think it stupid
so got anything
anyone could have done
who wouldve cared at all
not you
laughing
another heart
has made the trade
forget it forget it

i dont understand
how a heart is a spade
bell ringing

i am not a tragic orphan
i actually have
too many brothers
four which is
simply excessive
and then there my mother
postnatal depression
which you should
absolutely expect
if you get pregnant at 38 ugh
unlike virginia woolf i dont
even have a room of one own
this is krissi room with
a partition down the middle
like berlin

elizabeth taylor
the bronte sisters
donna summer
dr sigmund freud
good morning johanna

wise counsel of my god wall

musical number cant cure
how much longer am i going to

on andy bibby
andy bibby farts on his own
hands and throws them at people
shouting turtle power
well we could conduct
our relationship downwind
what about richard moseley

richard moseley once shot
a snail with an air rifle
john kellog has a good bag
and so chaucer
was one of the first poets
to use the five-stress line
the decasyllabic cousin
to the iambic pentameter
the man who helped standardize
middle english
a daring satirist
a protofeminist
and not as surmised
by lee bacon

bell ringing
indistinct chatter

east of eden west of solihull
with his poem brut 66
i only have three true friends
the moon my fist and a gun

by her family unusual business

by johanna morrigan
my father sells your babies
you howl when youre alone
you do not know
who your parents are
and all you want to do is bone
well my best friend is bianca
my dog
despite her mental health
seeming fragile
and when it comes to scaring
off assailants or yobs
she has proven less than agile
you cannot hug me
with your paws
i know bianca
ive tried

dog anatomy lacks
rotator cuffs
you cant open your forelegs
that wide
but bianca
i know you can always hug me
you can always hug me
hug me with your eyes
im so nervous
im so nervous
when you know that there
one million people watching
it nerve-racking

lonely teenager into dog

why are your songs so sad

that big one

born in a crossfire
hurricane

the stones
have you never listened
to the stones
i have the best of
reserved at the library
but there are six other
reservations ahead of me
and yet you can quote ulysses
well no one reserved that
at the library
i bet
well
like you baby
im a scratcher
i was born in blackwood
south wales valleys
in a crossfire drizzle
my mother had my three sisters
and then she got ill
wed go and visit her
in hospital and uh
she uh
she didnt wanna touch us
it made her cry
and when wed say goodbye
shed press the tips of her
fingers to her mouth
press it on our mouths
and say this is john kiss
and the little ones you know
they just wanted their mum
glass clinks
when she uh decided to die
id go into her wardrobe
andput on her coat
and hug em
so they could smell her
you know
i read somewhere
that what you do with puppies
youput em in a cardboard box
with a blanket that smells
of their mother
and your dad
chuckles
this is all off the record now
of course
we are off road now
and off balance too
both chuckle
glass clinks
this is far too much about me
you tell me one true thing
about you
whose eyes do you have
whose whose wonder
i used to think that anyone
who didnt have my mother
my eyes are hers
or my father
he the one who loves the world
was so unlucky
they might as well
just lie down and die
chuckles softly
but then she had
the unexpected twins
and now she just
i miss her
even though she there
so i guess i write
because that like
putting a wish into a bottle
isnt it
baby i think we are both
in the business
of putting wishes in bottles
i mean that the whole
business were in
chuckles
do you want some nuts
hmm
alright
both laugh
i love a bath
oh me too
i just dont understand showers
theyre depressing
it like standing in the rain
on purpose
chuckles
but i love doors
they make the outside stop
ah i love doors now

john kite in dublin
he not a beautiful boy
nor a tall one
but when the wind blows in
on the street corner
you can hear his heart beat
under his shirt
and when conversation
accelerates
you can hear his mind
chime like a clock
he is bright bright bright
like the lantern above a pub
door in november
he makes you wanna come in
and never leave
when he smiles it like
plugging in a wurlitzer
the dance floor floods
with jivers
and this tony this is why
we dont employ little girls
to write our newspaper
ive never been
in an organization
that wasnt improved
from hiring jailbait
shirley temple is fired

if you think it acceptable
to dress like work-experience
vampires

face of
a grand national winner

and it turns out
im really good at it
everyone wants a piece
of dolly wilde
and god wisely made enough
to go around
so im entering my
inevitable period of
intense sexual experimentation
instrumental music
ive done it with someone
from west bromwich
moaning
ive done it with
a freaky foot guy
i did with a man who faints
every time he sees a nipple
and just last night
i encountered something
i didnt think was possible
a penis that was too big
groaning
luckily im a quick learner
ill give you my tips
one when in missionary
place your hands
flat on his chest
and brace brace
brace with your arms
two in doggy
you can essentially keep
crawling away from the penis
every time he tries to get
a bit more inside
you just gallop a little faster
kris
im gonna be sick
kris
kris kris
you can share some of your
sexual experiences
such as they may be
hm
you need to be more repressed
door closes

waiting
the future can be
awfully short johanna
i havent got
anywhere else to go
johanna
i dont want to look at you
johanna
no i dont want to
look at you johanna
im sick of it
what
six months ago
you were a happy girl actually
being useful around the house
and now ive got him
telling me that
youve cock-blocked his career
i never said that
him in tears
to be clear they were
intellectually justified
tears of rage
saying that
youve treated him like a
an indolent hobbyist
yeah
and and now your
teacher on the phone
saying that youve resigned
so my question to you johanna
is when did you lose
your fucking mind
i guess it was around the time
i stopped being your daughter
and became the rent
the same time i like to think
you became absolutely
disqualified
from criticizing me
were your parents
we can always criticize ya
no not if you arent actually
doing any parenting of me
and you are selling cars
i bought in order to fund
springtime for hitler
a jazz odyssey
oh my god there still no one
saying sorry johanna
or well done johanna
or things must have been hard
for you johanna
do you think all this is normal
do you think im normal

played them your record dad

stationary there is no cell because her
parents are antyfalowcami
what no reaction
what me hanging
julien do not talk to philip
easy carole
how quietly as many have done
to find her
and he so thank you for that
what do you have to philip it is too old
is an idiot is embarrassing
and something else
carole after all so they did not say
they said
and if not it definitely thought
enough lies now we are talking
ourselves but the truth
do you want the truth tara i do not care
i met a great girl here
except that the pig someone already has
julien
give me a break
if we say anything now
i also met a super guy and
that punk from the pool
it not punk it a hipster
manon come on what did you do with him
mom but certainly not to piss off
it was even nice
although still a little hurt
manon you have 3 years what are you talking about
about my tattoo
aaah that wonderful darling
as well that did it myself
were going after julien
sure julien
tattoo is a great thing
outstanding
even though you have not seen it
that okay it is beautiful
it is certainly nice
you have great taste
cholera
he could not have gone far
he not answering
why do not you call
he not answering
that unlike him
relax think
we are the fortress of charles v in
the sixteenth century
we are now somewhere
i do not understand you the point is
that it was built on the set of wheels
so if you go this way
and that way i
take longer forgive
i have to let go
charles v prided himself on this project
thanks to him the city was
impregnable
nobody wants to listen to me
julien
julien
look i know im not your father
or even your bro
what
come on bro buddy
but ill tell you something
something personal
about me and my life
it never went to women
his first wife left me
i hated her for it
but now i think she was right
if she was with me satisfied
it would not do that
and now im shaking breeches
your mom will do the same
do not leave you what have you
it is totally zabujana you
thanks but
it not so simple
my parents scrabble
dentures and all the rest
it complicated
and im not ready for you advice
but today on formentera
i met tara a beautiful girl
and when i said that you are looking for her
in her eyes she lit a spark
you passed the high school diploma you came here
to meet her
we have her number
perhaps now a shame to forgive
a winning number was not easy
he beat me one asshole
he attacked me for no reason
i barely escaped with his life
the poor man because frankly
i do not abhor aggression
it would have wiped him to a pulp
here you call
it the number that begins with 34
ill wait
ill have to look
because i certainly worried
why not add a gas
we left the city
finally someone said it out loud
it not unbearable
i do not know what it was
from the beginning do not want to accelerate
this speed limiter to 50 km / h
try now
we have it thanks julien
but you can kick-start
this chaise
not bad
and beware
carefully carefully
who wants to know the remarkable history of
the church of the holy gertrude
no one
too bad
good day
good morning

when i was a kid
not much older than sarah
my daddy built me a tree house
except that he was really busy
so i had to find a way
to get up there myself
then bryan wanted to come up
in the tree house
i wouldnt help
because i was with my friends
and i had a thing
about being brothers and
so my dad would sit me down
and hed say
you know you brother too
small to get in that tree house
youre gonna have to help him
he used to say see this
that one finger
right there
you can just break it
really easy
but two of them
two of them together
you cant break it
you cant break it
you understand
so i still got a hand
but i wish i could take you
to that tree house now
take you there
away from all this
you just did
you have beautiful eyes
shit now what
aah snakes

bryan give me the canteen
it empty
we can stop

visitors to atlantis
are required to report
to the nearest
police checkpoint
upon their arrival
citizens of the great
city state of atlantis
must be prepared to show
slack cards upon demand
lord over has issued
a statement
which reminds citizens
of atlantis
that there is no such thing
as a surface world
and rumors of the actual
existence of aliens are wrong
misleading
and counterproductive
to the future
of our great city state
anyone who thinks
they may have had contact
with an alien
female or older male
should report immediately
to general rykov
at government house
there is a reward
and finally the statement
stresses once and for all
aliens do not exist
the surface world
does not exist
and wanda saknussemm is a mere
figment of your imagination
hey you wake up
wake up
what are you
more important question
who are you
im bryan
im shank
heh
do you like my home
where am i
where do you think you are
if i knew
i wouldnt be asking
youre in atlantis city
atlantis city
atlantis city
new jersey
no
in the center of the earth
what kind of alien is this
um that a dog
where did you say i am
in the center of the earth
center of the earth right
um
look you better explain this
to me real slow
yes and then you can
tell me something
about the surface world
bryan
bryan
bryan
bryan
attention
you are in the atlantis
wasteland restricted area
all citizens are prohibited
from entering
i repeat
this is a restricted area
trespassers will be punished
by death
and a large fine
a reminder to all employees
at professor galba
transport to the surface
project
security wishes
to remind you
that any discussion
of the work being done here
is strictly forbidden
and punishable by death
thank you
have a good day
let me see if i can apply
a little bit
of light amplification
to make this stimulate
there you are
professor
you can save time
if you just do it my way
professor
it the modern technique
for atomic recompilation
your style is outdated
and of the stone age variety
i am an old cranky
professor
and i work
in an old cranky way
are you implying your technique
and knowledge are superior
to our advanced
atlantean science professor
im saying
that my method works
but most of all
this is my project
general rykov
you honor us
with your presence
is the progress on the transport
to the surface world
going well professor
it progressing general
are we on schedule
we could be
if professor galba would accept
modern scientific
atomic recompilation
it either my way
or no way
where consul crassis
he in charge here
i want to speak to him
i dont like all these changes
and talks of schedules
i never had an agreement
like that with him
he promised me
freedom and funding
money is tight professor
the economy is sluggish
and we cannot go on subsidizing
your research forever
i want to talk
to crassis
you cannot see crassis now
he having his hair done
in lemuria
youll have to deal
with me now
well i dont like you
and i certainly
detest him
why do you dislike us
professor
what have we done
to gain your animosity
i think youre going to use
my transporter to the surface
to send your army to conquer
the surface of the earth
ridiculous heh-heh-heh ridiculous
then why is he trying
to convince me
to make a cargo hold
for all their tanks
it will be our gift
to the aliens professor
now i want this transporter
completed within one month
or else
general rykov this old man
will stun us both soon
because of the failure of his earlier news conference
lord over has decided
to deliver his annual
state of the city speech
next week
it eagerly awaited
as a major announcement
concerning
the alien situation
general lord over
has moved up his speech
do you think he suspects
what were up to
no i think the pressure
for an official response
to the rumors
is forcing this speech
we have little time left
tola
do you have a good
believable alien yet
were close general
dangerously close
hello
i think im a bit lost
have i wandered into your
amusement park or something
you are an alien
arent you dear
well yeah i suppose i am
but ive got a work visa
coming from the embassy
next week
so thatll be all right
or wont it
where on earth are we going
none of this is necessary
it not very comfortable
either
just relax
general where do we take her
general
take her to the warehouse
tola
ill meet you there
well atlantis
does sound pretty weird
it getting very weird
i would normally sell you
aliens were very valuable
in atlantis
a little while ago
but now the government
arrests anyone
with any information
about aliens
it very dangerous
to have you with me
so how come youre helping me
and bernard out
i dont know i like things
from the surface world
i collect them
you can see my house
i get many things
from your world
fast photo here again with yet
another marvelous product
from govco the corporation
of your government
we can love each other
so hard that nothing
is gonna keep us apart
can we make a baby
possible existence
of aliens
can we go out
and look at your world
i mean as long as im here
id like to see atlantis
no
no it too dangerous
what that
it a beach
it so bright
and all the fluid
this is the surface world
yeah
sunrise brings a relaxing
moment for the natives
before the early morning planes arrive
if i can help you find
your way home
to the surface
will you take me home
with you bryan
what to my house
sure
my parents are pretty cool
about that stuff
ill be right back
i think i might be able
to find a way to get you home
but dont move from here
though
it very dangerous for you
in atlantis
the soldiers and the fat ladies
could easily find you
even you could have trouble
with the fat ladies bernard
let see
is it professor galba
who has the machine
to the surface
you are in sector 00
sector 00
a reminder
that temp body converters
will be a must later today

all well general
it seems that we have
three subjects
who are very close in every way
to the original alien
wanda saknussemm
it may not be necessary at all
supervisor
but general
weve worked very hard
to create
a perfect duplicate
but why duplicate
when we have a real alien
she not an alien
she doesnt even look like one
to saknussemm
nevertheless
she is still an alien
you can meet me
at government house
ill decide on my own how
i will be exposing lord over
go ahead tola

minor bit of pain
when i grip it to the hairpiece
to your skull
but it will be awesomeim bummed
a bit of agony
and torture anyway
it only hurts a little
so what are you trying
to do here
give her the tour
is it wiseit on the way to her cell
it your pension tola
yes
the applicants are sent here
by talent agents
from all over the city
and we decide
whether they are suitable
suitable for what
to become exact
wanda saknussemm replicas
they are washed and
dressed for
the transformation process
their skin is dyed
the perfect alien shade
and they are stretched
to wanda saknussemm
exact height
and this is where we teach them
to think and speak
like wanda saknussemm
who wanda saknussemm
and why are these girls
being made to look like her
they will be
wanda saknussemm
wanda was the first alien
ever to reach our world
she became quite a tourist
but why duplicate her
let just say general rykov
is planning to save atlantis
general rykov didnt
exactly seem the type
to care about the welfare
of the citizens
we all have our ambitions
yeah i suppose so
i have become
a bit muddled though
all i had to do
was take bernard for a bath
now i find myself
in the center of the earth
and i havent gotten a clue
where the dog is
what a dog
theyre pets
theyre small with big ears
and a lot of hair
we have them here in atlantis
we call them trolls
she doing that all wrong
am i
here
general rykov is

like that
wow im bummed

about your world
and how you came
to be here
well i was searching
for bryan this boy i met

american teenager

looking for him
i ended up here
in the center of the earth

citizens general rykov
and her police

who suffer from annoying
hair lice
try nice no lice
i have found a friend
of yours
a girl alien
named crystina
she been captured
by general rykov
and the government
crystina
what about my brother
richard
i know nothing about him
you sure they didnt capture
a quasi-hunky guy
not terribly bright with
a real obnoxious personality
no no alien like that
just the girl
i think
she in great danger
let go
wait
where do you think
youre going
to save her
impossible
why
she being kept in a secret
warehouse by general rykov
and these meanest
and toughest soldiers
and theyve got
many weapons
there are too many rumors
about aliens existing
somehow i must
put a stop to it
especially
since it seems one or two
may have actually
entered the city
i believe the aliens
are spies
being sent down to report
on our capabilities lord over
we must mobilize for war
and we must launch
a massive retaliation
good
i understand your paranoia
general rykov
and you could be right
but it important
atlantis not learn of the aliens
until the right time
i will go on tv
and insist there are no aliens
and the smell
of freshly-cut grass
and the warmth
of the springtime sun
that what waiting
on the surface
beauty and peace
hey lady are all people equal
trolls and humans
in most of the world
there are still places
where bad people still live
but that all changing
and there are no wars
or fighting
im afraid there still
a bit of that too
there a lot of hope
in the future
that why you must come
to the surface in peace
start the relationship off
on the right foot
there much we can do
together
perhaps the general
is wrong
yes
this is moldine
down at the cloning lab
sir i think we have
a serious situation here
yes
an alien is brainwashing tola
and the others
she telling them
about the surface
no
about how peaceful
and beautiful it is
no
better get down here
before it too late
what are the chances
of going back with you
crystina
first ive got to work out
how to get back up
that no problem
professor galba transporter
will get you out
who is going where tola
what is going on here
crystina was just
teaching us
about the surface world
general
i have told you
everything you need to know
about the surface world
you didnt tell us
about flowers
or sea breezes
or butterflies
or like warm summer days
or the temptations
you certainly didnt tell us
about the national
basketball association
enough
i do not have to explain
everything
i only give orders
lord over has moved
his speech up again
chain this alien and bring her
to the video chambers
ill use her to destroy
lord over
to take over atlantis
no
youre changing tola
youre changing color
here hold this
hey bryan be careful
this is not a problem

i think we should lead
off the album with that
i think l should
finish my album
that something we need to talk about
clay wants to move the release date up
that bullshit
hell no
listen were thinking we can
leak a track onto the lnternet
perhaps tie it in with a video
piece that looks sort of homemade
like it was shot on
a cell phone or something
that way it can be downloaded and then all
over the place so that nobody buys the album
it wont get downloaded all over the place
the album will be released weeks later
the l nternet the swap
meet of the world man
we can send a track out the next couple of
weeks and get some traction on the album
wait a minute and you
listen to this dude
since you didnt hear me the first
time real good it aint done yet
it can be done
im in the studio right now lma talk

earlier today i got a call
from a couple turkey hunters
out in the hawking hills area
now theyre doing
a documentary film
and they came across what
they believe to be a bigfoot
so i went out checked
everything out
and saw the location
of the sighting
and get this they got a video
where can we see this video
got it right in the truck
let go
god look at the
size of that thing
it gotta be eight feet
nine and a beauty
yeah i was right
there at that tree
were looking at nine feet
there also a footprint
about 20 inches long
i say we go check out
the footprint right now
nick you tell anybody else
no just called your office
and talked to sergeant moody
oh god whatd he say
scoffs more like
sergeant asshole
told me i was crazy said the
guys are probably on drugs
very unprofessional
he not exactly
mr popularity
the other day i was dealing
with a missing child case--
wait wait
you say there a missing child
yeah what about it
this is just a
hunch all right
but just maybe this missing kid
and our sasquatch are connected
how do you figure
hank humans and primates
share 96% of their dna code
it the most of
any other mammal
there been actual cases
where human children
have been raised by primates
most recently the
feral child of borneo
and the nigerian chimp boy
maybe the sasquatch
abducted this kid
to raise it as one of
their own for some reason
i dont know but
it just a guess
and i say we should
go check the area
well now search and
rescue is still there
searching for the kid
great
if it did take him
maybe well find him
let take my truck just
in case we got to off road
ill get a couple of
walkies and a shotgun
all right pilgrim

my grandpa was so amazing
but he died last year
so
well i
i just really miss him
so much
no doubt
every year id spend
my birthday with him

so much but
he would always remember
to remind me that -

wasnt my fault

some heavy shit

they call me donovan

donovan
can you come and play
celia
i cant im not allowed
dont worry
im here to protect you
im always going
to protect you celia
the cemetery
you saved me from that car
and countless other times
i might add
so what are you
like my guardian angel not exactly
i died too just like you
i was only eight at the time
so i understand how scared you must be
this might be easier
to explain
if i wasnt out here
freezing my ass off
if you think youre coming in here
youre out of your mind
you dont have a lot of time
two hours give or take
come 2 am it lights out
and then i suppose
i turn into a pumpkin
no then you become
completely vulnerable
to these nasty things
out here
so id can the sarcasm
because im trying to help you
im not letting you in here
just so you can turn into
one of those crazy
psycho demon things like my grandfather just did
you see that wasnt
your grandfather
it was the soul eater
that ate him
so now he can appear
act and sound like your grandfather
this is crazy
so what youre telling me
is that i wasnt only raped
and murdered tonight
but that my grandfather
was eaten
by one of those things
i dont know what to believe
well do you believe
that i am who i say i am
yes i do
well that enough for the time being
let me in
well it not locked
you actually
have to invite me in
you see
this white light around is called your sanctuary
people cant come in
your sanctuary
unless you invite them
and once in
they cant touch you unless you touch them first
so dont touch them
that would be bad
ok
come in
come with me
i have something
to show you
shit
wait hey
well come on
im not going out there
im not really good with heights
youre already dead
are you really afraid
of falling
take a look
were the only ones here
exactly it just
you and me now
that why
you gotta stick by me
wait i just saw
something look
what is that
that is a soul eater
what
a soul eater
is exactly as it sounds
it needs to feed constantly
or else it goes to hell
theyre all just waiting
for the perfect moment
when you step
out of the light
that when it can attack
youre my imaginary friend
i must just be imagining you
im as real as can be
in fact
im a little offended
that you stopped
believing in me
but you were the one
that stopped coming around
i havent seen you
since i was like eight
yeah but ive been there
the whole time
like when your grandfather joe
was in the hospital
or when you got drunk and crashed
your grandpa car into the dumpster
i was there when you lost
your virginityyou were there for that
i needed to make sure
that you were paying attention
you really never left
no
i wish i had known that
uh-ohwhat what is that
well that flicker means
that the light is dying
we need to move to a place
where the light is strong why
fastwhat happens
if it runs out
you dont want to know
come on let go inside
celia come on
hurry
celia
rachel
celia help
youve got to help meoh my god
dont listen to her
something after me
it trying to kill me
she not who she says
she is celia
dont listen to him
he cant be trusted
he not like you and me
im your friend
listen to me
listen to me
celia please
youve got to help me
i dont know
celia look at me
do you remember
yes
you came here
the night i died
it was different
i always liked playing
with you
yeah right i sucked
you were always
so much better than me
well i was tougher
than you
is that why
you stuck up for me
when everybody else made fun
i knew it wasnt about you
you were worried
about hurting someone else
do you remember the night
my grandfather died
that was a terrible night
i never really thanked you
i was all alone
you barely knew me
but you stayed with me all night
i wouldnt have made it
after that night
we were connected werent we
yeah
i helped you then celia
and now i need you
to help me
please
aah
aah aah
aah
what the hell
just happened to me
gee i dont know genius
maybe it the fact you ignored everything i told you
i was confusedthere no time
for confusion
they will do whatever it takes to get into your head
to get you out of the light
you have to be smarter than them
you have to think
ok but but if she -
if itwas not rachel
then how did it know all those
personal things about me
because when it feeds
it takes everything -
memories feelings
every-
we have to get
to the basement
hurry
now
aah
try to stick by me
from now on all right
no problem
hey
look
are you seeing this
i see everything
it a gift
youll find
i have many gifts
you can only see your old world through mirrors
so this is what happening
right now at this exact moment
yes
i guess they havent
found my body yet
else the party
would be over
once your body leaves the sanctuary

that you died when you did
i had so many places
to guide you
so many things to acquire
true love
motherhood pride
pride is my favorite

protecting me
so you could create
a perfect meal
but now ill just have to
work with what ive got
how about we start
with your laughter
not much to laugh about
these days anyway
such a small thing
to trade
and how about your loyalty
loyalty is quite a delicacy
and what need do you
have for it here i will give you nothing
id be careful
about what you say
this can be painful
or it can be easy
that is your only choice now
i will give you nothing

it should feel like
youre climbing
up the side of
a mountain yeah
your turn flash
im on it

gotta run
wow
im here to offer
some support
and jump two three
two three four
and one
wow what a workout
what in
the blue blazes
i think you can let go now
oh uh heh right
oh my gosh
i cant believe it
flash you just ran up
those bricks like zoom
and wonder woman
with the lasso
you were all
and superman
with the heat vision
you secured the base
with a pssh
batman swung in
and caught that guy
while green lantern
was putting the wall
back together
you guys are incredible
it is such an amazing
pleasure to meet you
you have been my hero
since i was just a kid
oop sorry
since you were a kid
by my observations
youre approximately
the same age as superman
same age oh no uh
i just meant that
watching you makes me
feel like a kid
hmm
anyway what a thrill
to meet you guys
i hope i didnt get in the way
not at all
in fact were grateful
mister
oh uh sorry
im shazam
uh shaz-what now
well shaz-bot
shazam
excuse me
shazam it was pretty courageous
of you to leap into danger like that
i know that one
of my powers too
courage of achilles
i used it just the other day
to eat some anchovies
how can we be sure
youre one of the good guys
totally understandable
but even if i wasnt
a great philosopher
once said
keep your friends close
and your enemies closer
so really what
do you have to lose
yep i know quotes
wisdom of solomon
sweet am i right
why does he keep mentioning
solomon atlas and the others
well i
his powers obviously derive
from each of the ancient heroes
he described
that makes up
the name shazam
s for the wisdom of solomon
h for the strength of hercules
a for the stamina of atlas
another a for
the courage of achilles
and m for
the speed of mercury
that means that
z must stand for
the power of zeus
still havent figure out
what that is myself
well whoever you are
we really appreciate
your help
my pleasure i mean
helping the justice league
so awesome
you should tag along
come to the hall of justice
see where the magic happens
i dont think
seriously
the hall of justice
like the hall of justice
oh man i i
be cool
this is the greatest thing
that ever happened to you
but just be cool
i mean i guess so
i dont have
anything going on
so uh yeah whatever
it not our fault
jeepers is right
we wouldve had your food
but the justice league
showed up
and ruined everything
enough
im tired of excuses
what i need is food
and if you cant get it
then i mr mind
will find others who can
yes
so powerful so hungry
so hungry
yes food
i need more food
excuse me sivana
how goes our small experiment
it done
this magically infused chemical
should do what you wanted
now can you stop
mind-controlling me and let me go
hmm nope
now jump like a kangaroo
mind control is the best
eat eat hunger
food
bring me more food
i must have more before
the justice league arrives
the justice league
here but how
call it intuition
and over here we have
our trouble alert system
if there a problem
anywhere in the world
well know about it
this is incredible
i
i think i might cry
hall of justice branded tissue
can i keep this
highly unsanitary
totally going
in my scrapbook
you guys i really cant
thank you enough for the tour
you all mean so much to me
the justice league has always
been a beacon of hope
in the darkest of times
ive always said
what would
the justice league do
i mean
it depends on your roster
that plastic man
is kind of different
but uh that doesnt matter
you guys have
helped me a lot
i might need one
of those hankies batman
well i better get going
i hope we do some superhero-ing
stuff together soon
no wait
i call
a justice league meeting
is a meeting necessary
we should be out
finding these monsters
i have their location
via the bat-tracer and
you know the rules batman
if one of us
calls a meeting
then we all must attend
should i go or
no stay right there
krypto will keep you company
it an ultrasonic whistle
one sec
a super-dog
ah hi krypto
arent you cute
yes you are yes you are
i think we should let him join
the league
but we just met him
not everyone is as reluctant to
join the league as you were batman
i like him
and not just because
he has a lightning bolt
on his chest
though that doesnt hurt
im with flash
there something
so innocent about him
you cant catch me
you cant catch me
or juvenile
i saw we take a vote
all in favor
raise your hand
shazam
we have an offer for you
an offer
wed like to invite you
to become a member of
the justice league
what is this for real
i i this isnt some
hidden camera show is it
there are 24 cameras
in this room
none of which you could find
even with superman abilities
no this isnt a prank
the reality is you fit all of
our justice league criteria
you have superpowers
check
fight for good
double check
and not a kid
check-aroni
so shazam what do you say
i will be
the best leaguer ever
i promise seriously
youll never regret this
shazam the justice league
is more than a
well-tuned crime fighting unit
it a family
a family
and families
are built on trust
shazam we think that
you could be a great
addition to the team
but in order for us
to fully trust you
we need to know
who you really are
not the superhero
but you
my uh oh no
dont worry
well go first
well except for batman
he kind of gets an exception
because he so grumpy
im not grumpy
yeah
i dont know you
no idea
i mean that not
even really a disguise
well sure it is
the star draws your view
from my face
not really
clark kent
oh wow you did
that amazing exposé
on building
without instructions
that was fantastic
oh thanks
i worked really hard
on that piece
ahem
oh right
so are you ready
to be part of the family
i
i
i cant
im sorry i i really am
i have to go
just as i surmised
shazam has something to hide
and this proves
he is not to be trusted
but you hide everything
bat exemption
no but i
bat exemption
now come on
we have monsters to catch
huh oh
hmm mm
i cant believe i didnt just
join the justice league
but if they knew that
i was just a kid

to know something
bothering you
but im a wizard
so maybe it does
billy you can tell me
anything
i had
this great day you know
fighting bad guys
meeting my heroes but then
but then the justice league
wanted me to join their team
that sounds wonderful
it was except
in order to join
they said
they needed to trust me
which means i would have
to reveal my secret identity
and you were afraid
they would reject you
when they found out
you werent an adult
exactly
i know that in your heart
all youve ever wanted
was a family billy
somewhere to belong
ive tried to give you
that place
but my time is running out
soon youll need
to find your own way
and youll discover
that being in a family
doesnt come without
its own risks
risks
like what
trust my son
trust to share a part
of yourself with others
and hope that those you
share it with will accept it
youre talking about
you sharing
the power of zeus
with me right
the first guy you chose
to be the wizard champion
well i wouldnt say first
there was another
his name was teth adam
shazam
but he would become
mighty adam
he started out as
the hero i hoped he would be
but i was blind not
to see his growing ambition
soon he was corrupted by
his power and turned to evil
he tried to enslave the world
but after a long
and trying battle
i defeated him
no
and thus he became
black adam
what did you do
i locked him away
where he can never harm
anyone again
the point is billy
that even i
the wise and powerful wizard
risked something
and continue to risk
by giving that power to you
my true champion
aw shucks
what is it
the league
i sense a trap go
and remember billy
nothing creates trust
like helping those in need
wisdom of solomon
no common sense
now go
there you are
now just hold still
i hate moths
fan out
no sign of anything
out of the ordinary
strange the bat radar
indicates the tracer should be right
where that box is
oh i got it
no it a trap
right as always batman
the monster society
welcomes you
is that a talking worm i mean
come on we fight worms now
im no mere worm flash
im the powerful mr mind
the greatest villain
in the galaxy
wanted in over three quadrants
of the universe
for my evil evilness
and now i can add defeating the
justice league to my accomplishments
sivana if you please
huh
though my powers of
mental persuasion are strong
i know they could never tame the
superheroic minds of the justice league
well maybe the flash
thanks a lot
youll never
get away with this
i already have
the adult mind
is hard to manipulate
but the mind of a child
sivana fans
huh
what
it worked
of course it worked
dr sivana is no slouch
im a kid
well ill be
butter-churned in july
but i dont wanna be a kid
what are you talking about

sivana can do
nothing and neither can you
ah so easy

too much to you
youre lucky i dont
take you out right now
i could you know
cause im batman

the best hero
o kay
point is it pays
to keep people at a distance
so you

hemingway once said
the best way to find out
if you can trust someone
is to trust them
fine shazam
billy batson
hey
i dont understand
how did you
it all started when i helped you
during that two-face situation
oh no which one
which one
the red wire billy
i dont know who
the voice belonged to
i just knew it saved our lives
after that i went about
my usual routine
well billy that the last of the
money you got from recycling
hope this sandwich is worth it
cause im starving
spare some food
have a great day
youre a nice boy
billy batson
hey how do you know my name

happened to me over the next couple of days
excuse me maam
let me give you a hand

a nice boy billy batson
i just kept running
into the strangest people
hey mister you dropped this
huh
youre a nice boy
here for your trouble
free subway token
thanks mister
little did i know
that small token
would lead me
on an incredible journey
billy batson you have
been found worthy
that voice
climb aboard for
the adventure of a lifetime
what is this place
the seven deadly enemies
of man
whoa what a scary bunch
billy batson
ive been expecting you
you that old man
i gave the food to
that woman i helped
to cross the street
and that guy i returned
his money to
they were all you
yes
i did that to test you billy
test me test me for what
to see if youre worthy
of great power
and you are billy
never have i seen
a heart so pure
the world is a dangerous place
it needs heroes
heroes like you
all you need to do
is say my name
your name
shazam
sha zam
no no no
you cant just say it timidly
otherwise how would you
ever introduce yourself to people
thatd be ridiculous
say it with meaning
with purpose
shazam
after getting the power
of shazam i went to work
helping the city
as best i could
it was awesome
not just because i had
these incredible powers
but you know
because i was a grownup
sorry kid
maybe next time
next
whoa
one please
but even with
all that power
it didnt really matter
i just wanted to belong
to not be alone
you wouldnt understand
youre the batman
youve got friends a family
but being a kid
an orphan
it the worst
i totally understand if you
dont want to work with me
now that you know
uh im sorry
i know this is supposed to be
like an important moment
but i dont really
recognize you
maybe in your adult form
im bruce wayne
bruce wayne
like the bruce wayne
billionaire bruce wayne
the bruce wayne with all those
super expensive sports cars
the bruce wayne with the private
jet that has its own arcade in it
holy moly what that like
it okay i mean
i only have like
500 games onboard
no big whoop
awesome
listen billy
when i was a kid about your age
i lost my parents too
so i know what it is
to be alone
i took that fear and loneliness and
decided to do something good with it
just like youre doing
be proud of who you are billy
kids can be heroes too
my three former robins
are a testament to that
what you did that brave
showing me really who you are
that trust
i dont know what the others would say
but youre all right with me
now back to business
we have to figure out why the
justice league is gathering all that food
and how to stop that telepathic tyrant
mr mind
speaking of food im starving
ooh me too
hey wanna see something cool
alfred can i get two glasses
of milk and cookies
and not the oatmeal kind
maybe ooh something
with chocolate chips in it
as you wish master damian
uh damian im
oh oh yes
faster old man
old man
you have your own butler
not bad right
hell make me whatever i want
unless i make him mad
which happens more than
wait a minute that it
mr mind said that
in order to control us
he had to make sure our minds
were young and impressionable
but that also means
he has limits
and if im right
which i always am
the more active the brains
of our friends are
the more difficult they are
to control
so we have to make them
angry or stressed
and that will break his hold on them
exactly
once the hold is broken we toss one of
these disrupters onto them and presto
no more mind control
got it
and shazam
good luck
the most powerful ring
in the galaxy
and here i am trolling
the ocean for stinky fish
ugh
say
that ring is pretty cool
oh hey yeah it can
make anything i can think of
really
really
even i dont know
a boat
please
wow what about a whale
like i told you
anything
not bad
so you can make anything
a jet
two jets
what about a dog piloting
a jet while drinking a shake
and wearing sunglasses
while wearing a large hat
and barking out the abcs
yeah all right
oh also a knight
in shining armor
with a sword riding a bicycle
handcuffed to a t-rex
standing behind a pony

the rock is destroyed
the more it weakens
the defenses of the building
shazam
if what is inside
this prison is released
an unspeakable terror
will be unleashed upon us all

and together
you can defeat this evil
the power of zeus

phone buzzing

woman i dont know
i probably shouldnt say this

but this is probably a sign
what is that supposed to mean
i told you and jake
not to adopt a black boy
they need to be
with their own kind
you think he doesnt see that
im not doing this right now
your husband died
and youre left
to raise him all alone
race has nothing
to do with it
hateful people make it that way
i called you to let you know
your grandson is missing

she just like you
she never listens
to a word i say
door knocking
we came over as
soon as we heard
you okay

i havent been
here in a while
i talked to my mom
and she just made things worse
let just focus on
john cause your mom
male yeah is it okay
if i searched the place
look for forced entry
yes
are there any leads
on where he might be
i have no idea
im not even sure
he left on his own
have you talked to the
school or any of his friends
i called he not at school
the principal talked
to the classmates
and nobody has seen him
do you mind if
we pray for you
okay thanks
no sign of forced entry
i spoke with the police
because it hasnt
been 24 hours yet
there nothing they
can do until then
24 hours
somebody could have taken
him across country by then
look i have some of
my friends on the force
looking for john while
theyre on patrol
and i also called
the help center
you mean the community
group at that church
at least we have
someone looking with us
we just cant sit here
and hope that they find him
let just calm down
we can think better-
calm down
i lost my husband
and now im ab out
to lost my son
you have yours
i waited until i was
married to have children
trying to be obedient
nobody does that anymore
slow paced music
i thought the lord
would honor it
and instead he
took jake from me
a couple of years
before jake passed
we found out we
couldnt have children
that why we decided to adopt
as soon as life
starts to act right
jake passes
and now this
i dont think i can
believe in god anymore
god wouldnt give people
more than they can bare
and we know that
those who love god
all things work for good
for those who are called
according to his purpose
birds chirping
ominous music
yeah there this
super hot guy here
he has so many
tattoos on his arm
but he has that one
piercing on his nose
oh it so hot
my mom hates when they
have nose piercings
hold on my mom calling

to go look for johnny
judy im busy
i asked you to wait judy
what if we have an
emergency we cant fulfill
it father day weekend
and were short of help
im not gonna sit around
and wait for another emergency
when we have one right now
male what if he not lost
huh
what if he at a friends
house or something
exactly
you dont know where he is
that why we
prepare for the worst
and expect the best
male judy come on
what is wrong with you
this isnt you
i figured after what
happened to lily
you would be the first person
to wanna find
somebody else child
you were born and
raised in a church
do you believe this
is what god wants
male i dont
even believe in god
i said do you believe this is
what god wants from you
are you listening to me
i said i dont even
believe in god
how
you work at a church
so what
cause i work at a
church doesnt mean
i have to believe in god
i need a paycheck
judy what
when i was coming up
i didnt have
choice of religion
it was given to me
and as a kid i couldnt
ask any questions
you were just being curious
no no no
you try telling that
to my aunt nessa
you question anything
in the bible
she find the biggest
thickest bible she could
and she hit you it right
in the back of your head
and i didnt realize
until i got older
that she was afraid
look i never believed in god
i never embraced any of it
i mean i took communion
i got baptized
i went to confession
i was just faking it
i dont believe jesus died
on the cross for my sins
especially no one
as crazy as i was
but
after lily died
i just stopped
believing all together
i didnt think he was real
why would he do that
because he loves you
if he loved her why
did he let her die
why did he let my baby die
i mean it wasnt her fault
i didnt take care of my health
and if he loved her
why did he do that
she didnt deserve it
i was driving
and i passed out
and i was wrong
and she had to pay for it
it not love
that why i dont
believe in god no more
i dont believe it
solemn music
oh my god this is crazy
when did you know
you were a christian
i asked you a question
it a simple answer
when did you know
you were a christian
judy when jesus died
on the cross for my sins
no no no no no
im not asking you when
you knew you were saved
im asking you to tell me
when did you know that
you were a christian
the moment
the second hour the minute
that you knew what
you believe now
when did you know
you were a christian
somber music
woman lord can
you hear me though
a long time ago i stopped
believing your reports
through your son christ
all things were possible
and that i simply believe
i believed every word you said
after all youre the same god
that raised lazarus
from the dead
he that wants some more
so i got a question
why did you save him
and not my daughter
this is not divine order
i wasnt supposed to bury her
she supposed to bury me now
what in the world
do you want from me
what do you mean that the
faith of a mustard seed
it was your mountain
that fell down on me
left to die and the
rumble cant see
to get from under my humbles
you never believed in me
til you see miraculous
signs and wonders
i wonder i wonder
was all that you could
claim even real
when she touched the hem of
your garment was she healed
what miracles did
you perform for paul
how did five loaves and
two fish feed all of yall
that water into wine
they had to be lying
babies birthed by old
women and virgins
jonah in the whale
daniel in the den
okay then really
see up until now i
never questioned you
but the prayers of the
righteous did you even hear
i begged to switch places
she was just a baby
jesus was supposed to take
the will in an instant
my lifeline was killed
awake me from this dream
this cant be real
devil on duty
lie destroy kill
mission accomplished
im all out of options
i cant face the odds
the lord said let
go and let god
do you ever feel like
if you prayed hard enough
certain things wouldnt happen
i never thought
about it like that
but i know what you mean
god not punishing you
for not praying enough
it feels like it
or either he just isnt there
what
i just feel like
prayer doesnt work
if it did why are all these
things happening to me
remember when was asked
why the blind man was blind
he said so that god
may get the glory
let god get the glory on this
so what do we do now
why dont we go inside
and see if there might
be a clue as to where
he might have went
yeah come on
wendy no no no
no no that not
his room anymore
it this way come on
this way
why is this missing
woman what is it
wendy john knife
you okay
jake bought john this knife
as a souvenir from the
father and son retreat
john never took it
out of the case
friend what do

he left on his own
and he coming back
slow paced music
birds chirping

earlier today you asked me
when was the moment
the second that i
knew i was a christian
it was when i saw a miracle
jesus said in john 448
unless i see miracles
in amazing things
they will not believe
some wont believe until
they see a miracle
i believe were so consumed
by the worlds ways that
it hinders our beliefs
we cant see clearly
my mom had cancer
male you dont
need to tell me that
slow paced music

mama day and night

miss grace

in a way i had
never seen anybody

she was on her knees
praying for her
a few days later
mama was healed
the doctors couldnt explain it
a few days after
all that i got a
chance to spend some
time with miss grace

answered her prayers
that she was praying for mama
she loved jesus

im gonna be honest with you
maybe you should
put up a few things
i mean the pictures
that you have of jake
can be pretty depressing
you have a photo of
him as your screensaver
on your computer and phone
you mentioned the
other day that you have
a photo of him on a
dashboard of your car
you even planning a ceremony
for the day that he died
look im not saying
forget about him
i just think it
important that we celebrate
the joy of jakes life
immersing yourself in his death
is only gonna make
you more depressed
you probably dont
even realize it
and i agree
you need surround
yourself with things
that bring you laughter
joy and inspiration
you need to celebrate
his good memories
and remember you have
a life to live too
our intake in our
lives is crucial
look people say
we are what we eat
were also what we hear and see
and we gotta be careful
what we allow in our lives
do you mind if
we prayed for you
jamal lord god the
creator of the earth
the heavens--

-----NewMovie-----
﻿
it how
every message ended
previously on
macgyver
but who they are
remains a mystery
they call themselves codex
theyve been around
a lot longer than we first thought
there nothing more dangerous
than people who do
the wrong things
for the right reasons
tell him
about file 47
would plunge the
world into chaos
what do you say
a little breakfast with your dear old aunt
why do you refuse to see
what is actually happening here
and what is that
youre compromised
auntie gwen got to you
im gonna try something
but it means
risking everything
everyone i love
im sorry
we didnt start the fire
by billy joel playing
get out of my way
were not gonna make it
the world been turning
ah god nice try
jackass
gwen that was
a meals on wheels
were running out of time
we tried to fight it
rock-and-roller
cola wars
i cant take it anymore
there is a plan
in place
just take a deep breath
okay bossy
but if something happens to me
there something
you should know
im gonna send file 47
to some friends in dc
okay that is a terrible plan
it is a complex statistical
analysis of the climate crisis
indisputable scientific proof
that our planet is dying
file 47 posits a plan
to wipe out
a considerable amount
of the population
in order to get the planet back on track
a theoretical plan
you dont think that
a little dangerous
to put that in the hands
of the government
seeing it in print
might scare them into action
politicians only care
about power
and you want to give
em even more power
to play god and decide
who lives and who dies
we know
what kind of planet

generator not great
but thanks to you
we dont have
to worry about power
what do you mean
thanks to us
you brought us shiva
spoiler alert
not just a weapon
it also known as a god
they call
the destroyer
it also named
after a goddess
associated with reincarnation
rebirth
in order
to be born again
first we have to die
shiva here
a
renewable
power source
be right back
your aunt must be really great
at dinner parties
she thinks she
saving the world
exactly
do you really think
we can change her mind
about this plan we dont
even know what the plan is
yeah i have a gut feeling
about this just
deep down somewhere
there some humanity left
somewhere
hey
i get it
you feel connected to her
to your mom
but i need you
to clear your head mac
we need to do
everything we can
to figure out
what theyre planning
yeah youre absolutely right
okay
until then
we need to look
like true believers
right
that doesnt look good
your reputation as artemis
precedes you ms davis
youve got a lot
of fans around here
would you mind accompanying
me to our tech room
uh like i said
were a package deal
you and i have other
business to attend to
we dont have a choice
right
ill s ill see you later
okay
okay
you come with me
and where are we off to
to meet leland
what a leland
he the man who saved my life
when the cia tried to kill me
uh he paid em off
had em declare me dead
who is he
he is codex
the man behind the curtain
among others
he a genius
before codex
file 47 was just theory
and statistics
on paper
now it a plan
to save the world
he helped me
resurrect it
he believes in me
and now
he has to believe in you
and if he doesnt
roman
isnt it about time
for your 400 feeding
let me guess they drop a
live goat into your cage
ill take it from here
no you wont
leland wants you to get your team ready
so i will meet you in
an hour in the vehicle bay
youll be fine
chopin nocturne
in e-flat minor playing
the years 347 to 35
the black plague in europe
over 00000 million
people died
and what happened
after that
the renaissance
and
codex
codex dates back to the 4th century
i know
it hard to believe huh
how is that
even possible
well a group of people
got together back then
with a singular purpose
to protect the planet
from plague
from famine
and
excuse my french
dumbasses
like the people
in power today
a lot of amazing science
had just come out
of the middle east
but westerners needed a
bit of a push
so we funded
a lot of the enlightenment
things were really clipping
along for us
and then
of course
things took a turn
for our dear mother earth
the industrial
revolution
kid good
everything went
all pear-shaped after that
plastics
were invented
we were worried when
they started splitting the atom
but we found
that chain reactions
do come in handy
you remember
world war i
course
franz ferdinand
guess what
he was codex
is that a jmw turner
yes it is
look at that sunset
he was influenced by
the 84 eruption
of mount tambora
spewed gas and ash
up into the sky
volcanic particles
in the stratosphere
probably diffused the light
used to be
mother earth
could protect herself
with an eruption
cool the earth back down
for the next couple
of years
that not the
case anymore
things have gotten out of hand
there just too damn many
of us
please
tell me what i can do to help
you got 20 people
on a lifeboat meant for ten
youre sinking
youre not gonna
make it to shore
what do you do
you throw the ten weakest out
and the strong can row us
back to shore
very good angus
have a nice day
you know
years ago
a man that you know
answered that question
the exact same way
russ taylor
his mind and his resources
were a perfect fit for us
but he refused our proposal
because he weak
friends
every single one of you
has made this day possible
it time to go to work
you okay
hey yeah fine
let do it
all right for security reasons
each team has a tablet
with instructions that will load
once you are on the road
everybody will be traveling
a different route
to attract
the least amount of attention
ill be directing the ops
from here in the bunker
what was is lost
what was is lost
but from death comes life
but from death
comes life
yeah
yeah
still think you
can change her mind
yeah i think our
best bet right now
is just go along with this plan
and see if we can figure out
a way to stop it
what plan mac
were flying blind
hey thanks
for helping us out
we can really use you
out there
sorry to
keep you in the dark
dont suppose you could
let us know what were in for
this is how leland does things
but it for our own good
right
come here
oh i just wish
your mom was here
all right
let do this
can you get in
we need all the intel
we can get
this thing is like
the fort knox of tablets
did leland give you
any clues
no but i
did see something
in the vehicle bay
dosimeters
the things
that measure radiation
yeah so the
question is
what do they have a
a dirty bomb or
do they have
a nuke
any clues in the tech room
no
they just had me writing code
there was something written
on the white board though
it it weird
it wasnt code
it was like an equation
with maybe six letters
it didnt happen to have
an f over an m did it
yeah
it did why
it an equation
for determining
nuclear fission critical mass
so they have a nuke
that explains why they
wanted to hack norad
leland said something
about starting a chain reaction
maybe theyre trying to start
world war iii if we can
well well well
the fam all here
get your gun out of my face
were trying to save everyone
oh that funny so are we
ive got a bad
feeling about this
okay everybody needs
to calm down
and well be okay
you really want us to believe
you used shiva to
infiltrate codex
yes so mac could find out
what their master plan is
yeah and we were making
a lot of progress
until you two showed up
we do not have time for this
im not buying any of this
you gassed us mac
i didnt have a choice
you booted me out of the phoenix
guys i promise
were on the same side here
yes i seem to recall
you betraying
and lying to us
as well riley
betrayed you
you guys dropped a freakin
hellfire missile on us
we tried to stop it
oh really now who lying
codex has a nuke
and every minute
that you keep
your guns trained on us
it gets closer to going off
and we get further away
from stopping it
ive known mac
longer than anyone
he telling the truth
desi taylor
take a breath
no im bringing them in
mac dont
i am going to change this tire
and were gonna make
the rendezvous
we do not have time for this
dont make me do this
taylor stand down
he compromised matty
oh really im the one
who compromised
hey matty did taylor
ever happen to mention to you
that codex tried to recruit him
what he talking about russ
yeah go ahead tell em russ
tell them how codex
approached you
tried to bring you on board
but you kept it a secret
because you didnt want
us to know
that youre the one
who compromised
desi
i want you
to put your weapon down
and put me on speaker
taylor stand down
i am not the one
who is compromised
all right
three years ago i was
approached by an organization
with considerable resources
codex
yes i didnt know that at the time
spearhead operations had a
contract with the us military
to deliver the hades prototype
the bioweapon
we stopped in la
the very same
codex offered me a large sum
to deliver it to them instead
i of course refused
so then they turned to bishop
exactly
someone tried to eliminate
me and they missed
instead five of
my teammates
my brothers in arms
for the last ten years
were taken out by an ied
which i later traced
back to codex
and ive been hunting
them ever since
im sorry for your loss
but does it justify this
all of this
buying the phoenix
using us
for your obsession for revenge
no matter the cost
youre all the best
at what you do
i needed you on my team
well then why wouldnt
you trust me
because i can no longer
read you angus
you fit no
discernible pattern
for all appearances you
crossed over to codex
yeah to stop you
from taking innocent lives
to save you from yourself
i just got a location
for the rendezvous point
that could be
where theyre launching
the nuke from
okay
here what were gonna do mac riley
youre gonna keep your covers
and get
to that rendezvous point
taylor desi
i want eyes on them
and keep a low profile
there just
one little problem
thanks
the last time
i changed a tire
was our camping trip
to yosemite remember
didnt leave our sleeping bags
for two days
hurry up
yeah got it
good
you know what
i trusted you
and you broke me down
and you got me to trust you
and let you in again and again
and when things got tough
you pushed me away
do you have any idea
what that did to me
youre the last person
i wanted to hurt
tire done
time to stop a nuke
everything okay
no no definitely not
got it
coordinates say the
rendezvous should be right there
were in position
we have eyes on mac and riley
youre late
yeah we got a flat
what are our instructions
standing by
nothing received yet
copy that
what is this place
just empty trucks
no nuke
what the hell is
a codex team doing here
i dont know and
i dont like it
this doesnt make sense
theyre all
at the rendezvous point
where the payload
gwendolyn
everything on schedule
were just getting eyes
on the payload
it not there
what do you mean
folks give us the room
a sec please
sit down
when i first found you
right after the crash
i thought to myself
ive never seen another human
shine more brightly
i could read a book
by you on a
moonless night
it easy to shine
when you have purpose
yeah but ive
always been in awe
of you gwen
im in awe of your
mind and your loyalty
even your anger
justifiable anger
they took
your sister
still here
thanks to you
leland what is happening
youve brought me
so much joy over the years
i hate to have to
bring you pain
your nephew angus
youve had such
high hopes for him
but he still a phoenix man
so ive put us all in jeopardy
were often blinded by
the love of our children
as ive been by
you many times
but now comes the hard part
what
what is this
guys youve got a helicopter
approaching from the south
can a helicopter
transport a nuke
not this one
that a cobra
attack helicopter
it a trap
what
everybody needs to run now
what are you talking about
theyre gonna blow up the warehouse
everybody needs to
get out of here now
let move let go
go go go code red
riles over here
come on
it gonna be loud
why
scarlett mr macgyver
and ms davis compromised
our security
more importantly
they compromised you
these human connections
are holding you back
taylor tell me you see them
no this fire too big
there no way of getting in
returning to base
it too hot drop it
weve got them matty
only you couldve
survived this
you okay
yeah
anyone else in there alive
what have you done
what codex always does
what was necessary
these people were
your weakness
i need your strength
need you to see
the big picture
now i know it stings
even though he
betrayed you
angus is your family
and scarlett
like a daughter
yeah what am i gonna
tell her sister
the truth
her sister died
for a greater good
is that what this is
that what it always is
were too close now for
these kind of mistakes
your nephew was dangerous
and your attachment
to him even more so
hmm
so who next
the council and i
have complete trust
in you
and yet you chose not to tell me
that you were gonna neutralize
my entire team
to protect you
to protect your mind
to protect your
natural leadership
you are valued
beyond measure
because you know
the hard truth
some are worth
more than others
you really think
gwen iced her entire team
no i dont
everything about that
attack just feels off
no angus that the true
face of your aunt gwen
im not giving up on her
guys there movement
at the codex ranch house
small convoy just pulled out
looks like a five-ton truck with
two jeeps acting as the escort
theyre moving something big
well
that got to be it that the nuke
closer
doing my best
im inside
look for id numbers
ill call up specs
it wasnt me
it was leland call
he knew that you
would betray us
he knew i would do
the right thing
the ends will justify
what had to be done
who are you trying to convince
me or you
gwen
it not too late to
put a stop to this
this couldnt be
what my mom wanted
nobody wants this angus
it what necessary
i cant believe that
sometimes you just have
to give people a chance
we gave people a chance
they failed
the world is dying
then give me
a chance to do it the right way
it doesnt take the whole world
sometimes you just need
that one person
that you can count on
who you trust
and together
any problem can be solved
i wish that were true
you know it is
i can see it
this isnt who you are
this isnt who
my mother hoped youd become
not the place
id pick for a family reunion
ive got this roman
got what exactly
your supposed-to-be-dead nephew
hiding in the back of our truck
no
angus
mac
take my hand
i still believe in you
no
mac
mac
get a little help here
it was a national park service logo
that said yellowstone on it
why would they pretend
to be forest rangers
volcanoes
leland had
a turner painting of one
he was talking
about them a lot
yeah but that guy just
sounds buckets of crazy
right but what
under yellowstone
is a supervolcano
did-did you just say
supervolcano
yeah i think theyre gonna use
the nuke to somehow set it off
you know
i actually did you a favor
because leland
wouldve had me kill you
it a bumpy road
i need to concentrate
okay so
think of a volcanic eruption
like the uh popping
of a champagne bottle
the cork blows out
and then all of the gases
that are trapped inside
they suddenly expand
and shoot out
and codex is popping
that cork
using a nuclear bomb
right but now imagine
instead of liquid
shooting out
it the gases that have been
trapped inside of magma
for hundreds
of thousands of years
expel ash and cover
the entire western hemisphere
summer would disappear
for possibly years
wait a second
just from one volcano
well yes
but not just any volcano
a really really big one
the best i can tell weve been
driving over this thing
for the past two hours
without sunlight
the planet cools
reversing the greenhouse effect
which is good
but it also destroys crops
causing famine disease
it basically a reset switch
we need to find that nuke
matty are you still tracking
that convoy
were trying
we havent spotted them yet
actually i know how to find it
you do
yeah before i fell
out of that truck
i managed to jam my phone
under the loading ramp
tracing the signal now
it good to have you back mac
sorry about the uh
gun in your face thing
eh what a gun in the face
between friends
one lookout
truck empty
they must have already moved
the bomb
the park service
awarded a contract
to a construction company
to retrofit the dam
it been under
repair for a year
and the president
of that company on paper
martin bishop
so codex set up a dummy corp
to run the dam but why
i dont know
but it has something to do with drilling
drilling wait
what makes you say that
because at the same time
codex took over the dam
they started buying up
a bunch of local
heavy-duty drilling equipment
riles i need a usgs map
of yellowstone
right
here you go
thanks
i knew it okay see there
directly under the dam
mm-hmm
it a side vent
to the volcano
magma chamber
it a thousand feet
and some change down
but it right there
they want to aim a nuke
at a river of lava
no i think theyre gonna blow
a hole where the dam is
what they want is this river
massive amounts of water
flood into the hole
that they drilled
right into the magma chamber
pressure builds and boom
water triggers the
eruption thanks
good news is i got a look
at the bomb it a b6
and you can disarm it
no chance
but what i can do is
build a shaped charge
to interrupt the
chain reaction
you want to blow up
a nuclear bomb
yup but hopefully
we just get
a good old-fashioned
run-of-the-mill explosion
no nuke going off
no mushroom cloud
if i can find the
right materials and
if we can find the nuke
it should work
i think follow me
well if
youre sure
no sign of the
nuke on these feeds
right well cover more
ground searching if we split up
riley you stay here
keep watch
okay
hey guys i uh found some
of codex drilling equipment
and uh
everything i need
to finish my build
a nuclear explosion
is initiated
by a very precise
conventional explosion
this pushes
the fusible material together
to start a chain reaction
but if the material doesnt go
together in just the right way
you might only get
a partial reaction
or even no nuclear explosion
at all
so how is
whatever youre building
supposed to work
like a shotgun
im gonna aim it directly at the
nuke and it should interrupt
the chain reaction
the time-delay fuse will
give us enough time to clear
the building before it goes off
hey guys
uh something happening
codex is bugging out
i dont know why
i do
theyre getting out of the blast zone
they armed the nuke
how do you know that
because im looking
right at it
right coming at you mac
auntie gwen i presume
taylor wait wait
dying just
aint your thing huh
you dont want to do this
i dont want to shoot you
but it what has to be done
that what
you tell yourself isnt it
but i was wrong
i saw the data and
i lost hope that people
could change that
that they could be better
i know that angus
showed you a better way
he showed me too
he my family
i want to help him
killing me
doesnt stop this
the only thing
that does that is helping angus
and youre not gonna
get to him in time
you all right
yeah
we have less than six minutes
and it cant be disarmed
i know
that not the plan
interrupt the
chain reaction
smart kid
the time-delay fuse
it must have broken
when he attacked me
im gonna have
to set it off manually
this is a one-way trip
i need you guys to get
as far away from here as
possible as fast as you can
the time delay wont work
im gonna set it off myself
mac
dont think
just run
angus go
i can do this
what no i
there
no time let me do this
please
for ellen
you connect this to uh
i know i got it
you deserve the world
and the world deserves you
go
run now
well done
we have a nuclear
emergency support team excavating
the dixon dam site
although gwen managed to stop
a full-scale nuclear explosion
we still need to sweep the area
for radiation
mac
were uh
were sorry about your aunt
thanks
so what about codex
the bunker empty
cleared out
looks like leland took the rest
of codex into hiding
we destroyed
their infrastructure
and their plan
oh
uh one more thing
oh bloody
ow
oh bloody
wanking
is that supposed to be swearing
no no it all right
no no
thank you
your badges
welcome back to the phoenix
hilarious
ill get you new ones as soon
as possible in the meantime
im gonna be uh out of
action for a while so mac
youre going to have to
take over my duties too
there a lot of work
to be done out there
about that
i think i know
just where to begin
you ready for this
of course yeah
itll be fine
youre nervous
i know you better
than you think
oh yeah
what am i thinking right now
third season of rick
and morty is the best
you shouldnt have
had an espresso and
you really want to fix that
broken light fixture over there
it was americano
ah
desi
i am
hey let not talk
about it okay
yeah right understood
what i mean egghead is
i dont want to talk
about it right now
you can buy me a drink
and well talk later
you got it
as long as i do
the drink ordering
because your taste in
drinks is embarrassing
it was one time
id never seen a bubblegum
cosmotini spritzer before
i just wanted to try it out
you had two
hey were ready for you
yeah of course
uh
yes
thank you for joining us
mr macgyver
we value your opinion
thank you very much
but this is not
about opinions
it about science
our planet is in trouble
knowing isnt enough
we must apply
being willing isnt enough
we must do

it all over the news
theyre saying you guys

no man not me
my-my my partner
you know he was gonna do that
no of course not
son of a bitch popped the guard

before splitting with the cash
i was lucky to get away

the cops what you know
ricky ricky forget it
you were there

im not turning myself in
i didnt kill nobody

what happened
whose blood is that
icepickis he okay

you heard about that
warehouse that got hit
in pearl city last night
yeah i-i saw it on the news
icepick was there
well you got to tell hpd
i cant
rick someone died last night
i know you guys are family
but this is magnum
it about more than that
look
i knew it was going down
i saw icepick last night
so you knew about it
and you didnt do anything
no i got in his face
i told him he couldnt do it
i told him to turn around
and walk away
hell
i thought he did i gave him a ride home
and he still went through with it
yeah
you were with him last night
you had advance knowledge of it
considering your relationship
theyre gonna think
you were involved
that why im here
if i go to the cops
we could both end up in prison
but there a killer on the loose
somebody got to catch him
and im sorry to put
you guy sin this position
but i dont know
who else to turn to
look thomas i need your help
sorry about the blood
there some pain medication
in the cabinet next to the fridge
i didnt want
to come here
rick insisted on it
it just as well he did
tell us about your partner
his name is adrian reese
we were in halawa together
he was getting out
he had a score lined up
wanted to pick
my brain about it
i figure i aint going anywhere so
so you gave him your take on it
for a roll of commissary stamps
and a pack of smokes yeah
but then i got out early and
i figured
what the hell ill hit up reese
and maybe he wants
some company
where do we find this guy
i wouldnt know
is there any information
you could give us
any detail that might help
no
come on there got
to be something
ice think
there a guy lying dead
in the morgue because of us
what are you talking about
because of us
i didnt see you there
i shouldve stopped you come on rick
you know you had
nothing to do with this
no i shouldve stayed with him
made sure he didnt go back
instead i trusted you
yeah well then you
didn’t learn what i taught you kid
what that
never trust a crook
yo
yo i got your message
you all right
yeah im fine
all right anything
you need i got you
thanks
yeah
thanks tc
im here for him
if you didnt have
a hole in you
the two of us
would be having words
youre a good friend
like you shouldve been
look my boy could go down
because of what you did
all right tc just
take a breath
no he right
i got myself into this
im the one
who got to make it right
where do you think youre going
to find reese
yeah that not happening
magnum right
youre in no fit state to go anywhere
you need to stay here
till you get your strength back
let us do our job
what this about
our client thinks this guy reese
might be the father
of her child
so we need to find him and collect dna
well you need a
court order for that
unless you plan to raid
his trash in search
of a half-eaten sandwich
or some used dental floss
right now were just focused
on uh tracking him down
he gone off grid
i can let you look at the file
but you cant take it with you
deal
here he is
all right thanks
hey listen i just want to say
im sorry to see you go
but i think you made
the right decision
i appreciate that
i hope this one doesnt give
you too much grief while im gone
heard that
let me know when
you get settled
im thinking about taking my
son to europe for summer vacation
maybe well look you up
oh yeah
you absolutely have to
id love to show you around
okay it looks like our guy
reese has a bunch of aliases
okay well
that a good place to start
all right thanks gordon
owe you one
just one
cheerio
hey when youre back
in london you dont mind
if i ask you to do stuff
like this for me right
hmm if i said i would mind
would it stop you
probably not
and besides i figure
it the least you can do
considering youre kind of
bailing on our partnership
im sorry but that is not my choice
is that why youve been
avoiding me this whole time
cause you think lm abandoning you
im not avoiding you
youve been on the surf ski
three times a day
since i told you i was leaving
well i like to surf-ski
no one likes paddling that much magnum
okay i take it back
youre not bailing
on me i just um
im disappointed
that youre leaving
so am i
hey
anything yet
were working on it
how mr hofstetler
he uh
he sleeping
what going on
robin coming to hawaii
i told him it wasnt necessary
that we could
deal with the particulars
of my exit over the phone
i-i dont think that it
what do you mean
well i talked to a guy
from five-o and he said
he may know a lawyer
who can help out with this
but it-it
very expensive
so i asked robin
to look into it
i wish you hadnt done that
why not
because robin’s already done so much for me
yeah you didnt ask
him to do anything i did and besides
it a long shot
uh almost zero percent chance
that it
gonna work
what is it
i dont know but
robin said that um
if it doesnt work he still
wanted to say goodbye
that very thoughtful of him
yeah well that robin
you know id like
to throw you a party
before you go uh
assuming im not in jail
thank you rickyeah
why dont you go home
take a shower
and maybe check in on the bar
uh no im-im okay
ill stick around
rick seriously
go take care of yourself
weve got this
all right well uh
call me if you find reese
i feel bad for him
shouldering the weight of this problem
he shouldnt blame himself
i dont think it that
i-i just think he feels like
icepick betrayed him
well he not wrong
i mean if it were me
i dont know
that i would protect him
yeah i dont think
i would either
but it complicated
i mean without icepick
rick probably wouldve ended up
on a very different path
rick feels like he owes him
yeah
oh i have something
reese used one of his aliases
to check
into the honua lani inn
then let head over there
but uh
but um this is the
picture of the guy
promise me you wont use
that fake badge when im gone
this little piece of tin
opens a lot of doors okay
so that a no
it-it helps me do my job
asking me not to use it
is like asking steph
curry not to use his jump shot
a jump shot yeah we have basketball
in england magnum
the door been busted open
mr hofstetler
he aint here
we mustve just
missed him
you lied to us
yeah well i didnt
want you more involved
than you already are
so you were just gonna execute
a man in cold blood
he didnt hesitate to pull
the trigger on that guard
last night couldve been a clean score
but that wasn’t good enough for reese
no no he wanted
to have it all for himself
and he didnt want
to leave any witnesses
20 years ago
i never would’ve trusted a guy like that
because i did
youre all in a fix now
maybe you can
still do some good
tell us what you know about
reese so we can find him
yeah then what
then we turn him in
figure out some way to
keep you and rick out of this
man you dont get it
i dont want
to put him back behind bars
i want someone
to stick him in the ground
it the only way you stop a man like that
he evil
even if you are right
that not what rick
wants us to do
hey boss yeah
there was a guy in
here looking for you who
he didnt leave his name
he sitting in the booth over there
all right thanks
funny ive been
looking for you
walk
walk all right
where the car
take it easy
it the porsche
good let go for a ride
okay where do you want to go
youre gonna take me
to icepick let go
if he moves off that sofa
shoot him you got it
oh girls
they want to have fun
rick
okay were on our way
we got to go
okay
i know it doesnt look like it
but i swear i got in
some pretty good shots
yeah sure you did
i did seriously
and i believe you
it doesnt sound like you do theodore
guys please
what did he want
he wanted to finish what
he started with ice
yeah dude mustve seen
coverage of the robbery
heard that there was only
one dead body instead of two
knew he messed up
yeah well if he hunting icepick
it only a matter of
time before he finds him
im more concerned
about you at the moment
im gonna be fine
maybe now you are
but reese knows that
you can link him to that heist
he gonna want you dead too
ah he got the money if he was smart
hed get off this rock
while he still can
if he was gonna do that
he wouldve done that yesterday
think he more concerned
with tying up loose ends
you sure
it sounds risky
i guess it better than
looking over your shoulder
for the rest of your life
we dont have a choice
we have to bring
the fight to reese
we have to find him
and take him down
before he gets to rick
and icepick
you guys got any leads
none of reese other aliases
from hpd panned out
but icepick did mention
another name
he been using
carl brewer
were looking into it now
all right well im
staying here with orville
until this whole
thing over
i dont need a bodyguard
im staying
he staying
i dont know you too well
but the way
youre looking at me
feels like you might
want to use that thing
believe me im tempted
no one was supposed
to get killed
given your experience
you had to know
that was still a possibility
ive been on the inside
for a long time
being on the prowl
that it what i do
i couldnt resist
one last score
i really didnt want anyone
to get hurt
uh-huh
what about rick
what about him
he like your son
youre supposed to protect him
i always have
best i could
until now
you put him
and everyone i love in danger
and for what money
you only care
about yourself
should be ashamed
i am
wasnt about the money though
then whyd you do it
i havent got that long left
i just wanted to
feel like it used to
i needed something
to make me feel alive again
really really alive
if only for
just one night
figure what have i got left
to lose
you had rick
wasnt that enough
it shouldve been
i guess ive been lying to
myself about being at peace
truth is
im not ready
to die just yet
anything on carl brewer
yeah
reese actually used that
alias to get a cellular data plan
oh okay score one for icepick
mm-hmm
ping the phone yet
why is it everything that
comes out of your mouth is a query
what im driving
youre laptop-ing
laptop-ing
it just not my thing
firstly laptop-ing is not a word
and secondly you really ought
to make it your thing magnum
if youre gonna continue
your business without me
well maybe you can teach me
before you leave
i have days magnum not months
and as to your query i cant ping
mr brewer cell phone
because it dead
but according
to his cell phone records
he did call one number
more frequently than most
and that belongs to a
leon yates
leon yates
name sounds familiar
could you pull up the news
coverage from the robbery uh-huh
leon yates
was the armed guard who
was killed during the heist
seems he wasnt such an
innocent victim after all
no he more like
an inside man
which would explain
how reese knew
that there was a safe
full of cash in the warehouse
yates have any family
says here he was survived
by a girlfriend
cynthia lloyd in kalihi
maybe she knows something
ms lloyd
yes
im jan hawks
this is travis mccoy
were investigating
the warehouse robbery
on behalf of its insurance company
were very sorry
for your loss
we heard your
boyfriend leon
was a very dedicated
security guard
do you mind
if we ask you a few questions
do we have to do this now
we understand
it a difficult time for you
generally in these circumstances
it better to move quickly
well only take a minute
thank you
thank you
mm-hmm
i um
i just dont know
how i can help
for starters you can tell us
if you recognize this man
no ive never
seen him beforeokay
so you uh you
live here alone huh
just me
this is um
you and leon huh
looks like
wailua falls
last christmas
thank for your time
were very
uh very sorry for your loss jan
well call you if we
have any more questions
our sincere condolences
cant let you leave just yet
lock the door
look we mean no disrespect
were just working
for our clients
clients right
friends of rick
looked him up online
saw a press conference
you guys got back from the sandbox
few years ago
pow heroes
okay you got me
but this doesnt
look like a hostage situation
on a hunch id say these two
had something going on
behind leon back
so what you use leon
stab him in the back
and then steal his girl
not in that order but yeah
what do you want
youre gonna call your buddy
youre gonna bring him
and the old man down
here and if you dont
it lights-out
for old mary poppins here

a qrf in the korengal
that the whole reason the
talis were able to grab us

another workout of you
last words you ever say
gordon save it
your pal icepick is going

and these are to be
used only if necessary
sure you dont want
to give me the bigger gun

to feel bad for me
i lived my life
the way i wanted to
and most parts
im im proud of
other parts not so much

to be one hell of a man
and always be grateful for them

ill see you soon
i love you
when you think
youre all alone
expect to hear from the
prosecuting attorney

brother
higgins is leaving today

im not sure if there was
anything else i couldve done
she drives me crazy
but i got to admit
im really gonna miss her
when you get knocked down
and youve had enough
i will look after you
oh
i trust that magnum will look
after you as i have done
try not to be too hard
on him all right

he can be quite fragile

a nick once in a while
remind him who boss
im gonna miss you
juliet
tc just landed
mr masters is here
okay
good boy he a good boy
yes
i will look after you
i will look after you

looks like robin made it
he up at the house
so i guess this is it
actually it not
turns out i dont ha veto leave after all
what do you mean
robin met with the attorney and together
they resolved my visa status
it all taken care of
so youre not going
uh you want me to
no
not at all im just
surprised
what did they do
it turns out
there this obscure law in the book
that says if you own a
company that’s valued at $500000
and you have at least five employees
then youre entitled to a visa
yeah but you dont have that
no no i dont
but uh
thanks to robin i now do
i still dont understand
robin just signed over
full ownership of his estate to me
you now own robin nest
yes and all of its contents
and with employees like
kumuas cultural curator and
well you as security consultant
amongst the others
ill be allowed to retain my
legal resident status
so technically
we now work for you
well yes i mean
there no technically about it
actually magnum
you and all the other employees
are now on my payroll
okay
how is this gonna work
that remains to be seen
anyway best not keep robin waiting
you know
im not sure l like this new setup
well magnum you kind of
only have yourself to blame
you were the one that put
this whole thing in motion
i didnt know this
was gonna happen
what about the ferrari
oh the ferrari
yes well technically
that now mine
you know i think
i might rechristen it
higgins 2 what do you think

perhaps it was a childishwish to look into this room
and find that i was right
you belong to a world
that ive lost long ago
youre not my mistake thea
in my work i must nevermisjudge people characters
because if i were tomake a mistake even once
i might have to pay
for it with my life

about you i should
have been dead a long time ago
we cant meet

i am a man with two heartsand only one will survive
when all is said and done
as the  said
thea
why are you so sad
please dont be angry if itell you that i cant accept
your lunatic explanation

the year 936
the phalangists occupy thecity but the mood is mild
it is on that day that fredericogarcia lorca poet playwright
artist is executed
and his body is
thrown into an unmarked grave
he was 38
there are those who look
upon the death of lorca
as a much greater symbol ofthe conflict of that region
in general not the
political conflict
but the deeper chasm
towards utter brutality
that lies in man
the  wrote
one body with littleblood but with two hearts
is that to say that there isnot enough blood in the body
to keep two heart alive or
that two hearts can turn
thin veins into a
nurturing river
we have to keep an eye on thoseopposing hearts because--
yes come in

hello nam
ying there news about wah
come to the police station
nam
nam
a hiker found this two days ago
and brought it to us
here you can keep his badge
the police
will no longer be involved in this case
it been seven years since the incident
our protocol states
that we cant continue the investigation
his badge is best in your keeping
in my keeping
i kept a lot of things too
but what the point
i thought you asked me to come up here
to let me know if there
were any developments
now that weve found his
badge there hope
but youre telling me
youre gonna stop investigating
ying calm down
you know i want to find wah as well
where did you find his badge
at wah last known location
around the snake stone in sai kung
who found it
a regular citizen
but something doesnt feel right to him
i want to meet him
alright
i want to know where did
you find this badge
im not obliged to say anything
but whatever i say
cant be used in a court of law
hey she asking you a question
ive already answered you before madam
you dont belive me yet youve asked
your subordinate to question me
what do you want
im not a cop
this is my father
he been missing for a long time
please tell me more
it a place that doesnt exist on map
hey what are you doing
dont you wanna know where i went
open the gate now
what did you think i would do
alright
since neither of you believe me leave now
i believe you
i want to know where you found this badge
please tell me i beg you
many people have searched for him
for seven years
but weve found nothing
you were the only one who found something
so i want you to tell me more
as you said it been seven years
hed be dead even if we found him
at least id have an answer
i wont give up until i find him
what if i told you
when i was there
i saw my wife who died five years ago
would you believe me
yes i would
but what i say would sounds ridiculous
i dont want others to think im a lunatic
nam
it an enchanted realm
it was a very foggy day
before i went into the enchanted realm
i kept going on the same path
after god-knows how long i finally left
but i couldnt locate myself on a map
and my compass doesnt work
i kept walking and walking
it mustve been more than seven days
but it never got dark
i never got hungry or thirsty
i saw a lot of people walk by
hey
but they couldnt hear me at all
hey
hey
finally i saw a beam of light
i walked towards it
and there she was my late wife
as i was approaching
i came back out
i went back to the mountains a few times
but i couldnt get into the enchanted realm
how did you get in in the first place
i have no idea
but i think it a realm
that is fluid in nature
it doesnt have a fixed entrance or exit
and certain conditions need to be met
in order to get in
im still trying to figure it out
for the first few months
after my father went missing
i was at the mountains every day
but i never crossed into
the enchanted realm
i found his badge at the enchanted realm
if you couldnt get in
you wouldnt be able to find him
so youre saying
that my father is in that realm
yes
enough
ying let go
this is absolute nonsense
let me ask you
are your dreams real
yes why
because they feel real
but how can you quantify your feelings
do you have tangible evidence
and the place you were in your dream
was it real
a dream is a dream what are you on about
ying he crazy
why are you still listening to him
i guess it time for this lunatic
to take his pills
both of you leave
i beg you please tell
me more about the realm
get out
let go
ying ying
it been seven years
if he really still alive
he wouldnt be in the mountains
a badge doesnt mean much
can you be more rational about this
he said he was up there for seven days
ive asked his family
and they said he was gone for a few hours
he a lying lunatic
the police werent able to find anything
of his for the past seven years
but this so-called lunatic found something
that belonged to my dad
should i believe him or you
i want to find wah as well
but that doesnt mean
im gonna believe anything anyone says
i know you think this is ridiculous
but i choose to believe
at least there a glimmer of hope
slowly be careful
dont worry i can handle by myself
ching loves you
that why he hired a maid for you
why did you have to fire the maid
that bastard kid
no ive already submitted it
wait a second
sorry vincent
yes it at home sorry
ill submit it first thing tomorrow morning

thanks for letting me
store stuff at your place
dont mention it
alright i should be heading back

my client called me for help
youre so late
we sent that girl to the hospital hours ago
hours ago
i know her
oh right ill get back to work
ying what are you doing here
that my client in there
she called me
and i got here as soon as i could
dont worry she not in danger
but you dont look too well
i got lost just now
what are you talking about
did you arrest that man

two oclock on the 4th
yes sorry i
sorry ill be there soon
mom how many times
have i told you not to wander around
it very dangerous
there you are
youve been gone a month
you didnt even call
did you spend all your money
and now youre asking me for some
mom i made you breakfast this morning
come on let go home
do you have any shame
mom let talk about this at home okay
there a lot of people here
what cannot be said out here
are you afraid of people finding out
about your bad deeds
you little bastard
everyone you know are imbeciles
you only ever ask me for money
you talk back at me when youre at home
youre the best at acting
acting like such a good boy out here
it angers me to have a son like you
other people have children too
none are as bad as you
you nasty little bastard
i regret having you
you never do what you promised
i hate people who are fake
killing without mercy
ying youre awake
that man killed people
you were only dreaming
it real
that man was killed children
in the housing estate
i saw a beam of light
just like the one the other guy said he saw
i went to the enchanted realm
i really went in there
stop your nonsense okay
the doctor said you had low blood sugar
if you carry on like
this youll faint again
also my father called me
he really called me
come on why dont you rest for a bit
yes vincent
hello when are you
submitting the proposal
im working on it now
you are rushing
youre always rushing whenever i call you
the client is flying off tomorrow morning
i need some time
ill send it to you when im done
what kind of attitude is this
son
what is it
im hungry
ill make you something later
how many times have i told you
dont bother me while im working
why dont you ever listen to me
are you trying to kill me
is the whole world trying to kill me
trying to kill me
im giving everything up
to take care of you every day
mr ho
im not available
just put down the money and go
i think ive been into the enchanted realm
what about your police friend
she doesnt believe me
it was very foggy
i kept trying to find my way
then i saw a man slaughtering children
that the enchanted realm
what you just said proves that im right
the enchanted realm appears in places
where violence was prevalent
just like
i saw a group of japanese soldiers
burying some villagers
the enchanted realm is a place
where time and space interlace
people in the realm will witness
deeds of injustice from the past
that why you saw that
man killing children
did you tell the cops
im not actually crazy okay
wait a second
how did you get out
i saw a beam of light just like you said
the space that the enchanted realm occupies
is the same as the real world
it just that the fluidity is different
there can be an enchanted realm right here
this can still be a mountaineering shop
in the enchanted realm
were just not in there at this moment
just like parallel universes in films
here a simpler metaphor
fluidity
same place but one is going faster
and the other is going slower
but there will be times when they overlap
like the hour-hand and the minute-hand
one goes faster and the other goes slower
but they overlap at times
and when they overlap
the entrance to the
enchanted real will open
and because of the difference in fluidity
the two worlds experience time differently
so seven days in the enchanted realm
was just a few hours in our world
yes
but it was the opposite for me
i was only there for a while
but when i got out
it already been a few hours
what symptoms did you experience
after you got out of the enchanted realm
i felt tired so tired that i fainted
my friend sent me to the hospital
the doctor said that my blood sugar was low
what did you do in the enchanted realm
after i saw the man kill the children
i kept on running
i get it now
i get it now
the time you experience
in the enchanted realm
not only will it be compressed
but it can also be extended
which explains the how
i was able to spend seven days in the realm
without any food or water and no sleep
because i wasnt hungry sleepy or thirsty
i thought i was in there for seven days
but it has only been a
few hours for my body
that why i didnt feel sleepy
hungry or thirsty
with the same logic
i was running for a while in there
but ive been running for hours
in the real world
right do you know why
you had low blood sugar
from excessive exercise
also when i was in there
i received a call from my dad
does that mean he in there somewhere
that possible
but that could also be his spiritual waves
ive also received a call
from my dead wife when i was there
so there hope in finding him
yes
how do i get back in
do you hear weird noises sometimes
or see strange unexplainable things
things that only you can see or hear
and nobody else can feel
that it
but once i left
i didnt see these things again
now you have the key
to enter the enchanted realm
what does that mean
it magnetic fields
it radio waves
youre able to receive radio waves
that others cant
im gonna need your help
with getting back in there
why do you want to
get into the enchanted realm
we are the same
were both looking for answers
mrs mak
ying there you are
your mother left a bag at my place
come get it for her
sure
your mother is a saint
she always here taking care of me
but she forgetful
she was too busy listening to music
listening to music
have a look
june 3rd 980
chan kin sang a 55-year-old man
heavily in debt with mental disorders
tied up his three daughters
all under ten years old
and killed them
and commited suicide by
falling to his death
why are you telling me this
that case happened
at lai ching estate room 224
that the same room
you said you saw the killing
back then the neighours said
that the man kept on saying
killing without mercy
before he committed suicide
so the case happened 30 years ago
i also looked at the cctv footage
in the building that day
and found some abnormalities
ive also checked that wah phone
did make a call from sai kung that day
so i was really in the enchanted realm
i refuse to believe any of it
then how would you explain this
you saw a case from 30 years ago
because it was a projection
from your subconscious
there mustve been a signal jam in the cctv
so it was footage from another elebator
what about the phone call
the radio waves in sai kung are unstable
there might be an error in the data
so if you dont believe any of this
why are you helping me
wah taught me everything at the academy
he was my mentor
he called me on the day he went missing
but i was on a case so i didnt answer
so ive always wanted to know the reason
behind his disappearance
what i can do
is to follow every lead on this case
nam i know you dont believe me
but can you help me one last time
ive already helped you many last times
when did i ever refuse
a women went missing in the mountains
early this morning
the police speculates
that she fell off a cliff
this was the sixth disappearance from
the mountains in the past two months
according to information found on the scene
the lady who disappeared
is between 50-60 years old
son it been a while
since youve gone on a hike with your dad
let go on a family hike together okay
oh sure
when youre free tell your dad
when we were young we
never went to the mall
we would always go on hiking dates
we saw a snake one time
your dad was a big guy
but he was so terrified
i had to hold him the whole time
he absolutely useless
but when has your father ever been useful

ive no clue
ive never needed a lawyer before
then we are left with only one option
public defender
wait a minute
there was this patient
from haldwani
a very senior lawyer
mr rastogi
i had once done him a favor
he might help
a criminal lawyer
i dont know but even if he isnt
he should be able to recommend someone
youll find his number in my computer
time up
which computer home or office

i called him mr rastogi
that all i remember

sona maternity home

he not meeting anyone

why dont you let me complete
now what your problem
why cant anyone let me
complete one fucking sentence
listen it a matter of life and death
please convey to mr rastogi
mrityunjoy mukherjee wife
is here to see him
dr mrityunjoy mukherjee wife
greetings madam
you know him
very well actually
i am mrs rastogi
nice to meet you
come on
baby mrs mukherjee is here
where my doctor
in prison
it all over the news
i thought you would be aware
since my cardiac arrest
ive no idea
what going on outside this room
the police have accused him
of being the serial killer
responsible for the murder
of six innocent unmarried pregnant women
each of the six missing girls
were found in the farm-house
of well-renowned gynecologist dr mri
all the bodies were dismembered
and six fetuses
were also found in the basement of
the city is in a complete state of shock
and all the lawyers in the city
have decided to not take the case
of dr mrityunjoy mukherjee
joy is innocent
he didnt kill anyone
i know
my doctor couldnt kill a fly
if his life depended on it
so youll help us
wont go to school today
didnt feel like it
bad boy
ill have to be of help
that the least i can do
for him for giving me
this bundle of joy at my age
ill immediately put my team on the case
but first things first
we apply for bail
but how will you go
to court in this condition
if i cant go well get the court here
okay
death to dr mukherjee
death to dr mukherjee
punish the guilty
hang the killer
punish the guilty
hang the killer
punish the guilty
hang the killer
s tiwari judge
defense how does your client plead
not guilty your honor
we plead not guilty and we move for bail
excuse me for appearing like this
your honor
but youre aware of my condition
so i crave your honor leave
to make an exception this one time
wasnt expecting a normal entry
from you mr rastogi you can carry on
thank you your honor
prosecution
prosecution
yes your honor
your honor actually
we ask that the defendant
be remanded without bail
we object your honor
the defendant is a surgeon
a respected member of the society
his property was misused by someone
there no evidence
to suggest he involved
there is your honor
fingerprints from cigarette butts
found at the crime scene
dna from hair samples
also found at the crime scene
all match with the accused
and prove his involvement
the bail application is rejected
the defendant will remain
in custody without bail
sona
sona
doctor you wont get away with this
beat him up
joy
what do we do now
ive gone through all the confidential
reports my team sourced
all the evidence
points towards your husband
all the victims
were single pregnant girls
who were aborted before being killed
and their fetuses were kept as trophies
this is something
only a gynecologist could do
are you also giving up on him
mrs mukherjee
im a very expensive lawyer
and expensive lawyers
are mostly defense attorneys
because only the ones
who need defending can afford us
look
i dont care
if your husband is guilty or not
but i can be of help to him and you
only if i know the truth
believe me
joy is innocent
exactly this
how can you be so sure
because i know who guilty
who
my ex-boyfriend
this entire incident started
since he came to our town
he getting back at me
the evidence he submitted in court today
he had stolen from our house
he has framed joy
he was in court
he the cop
who gave evidence to the prosecution
oh
that explains it
that explains how the evidence
was manipulated with such legal precision
as for the abortions
he could have paid any quack to do it
but what do we do now
can you prove
that this cop framed dr mukherjee
no
then technically there just one way
but practically that not for you
why
because when legal options
are exhausted
other options must be explored
i dont understand
let say a witness is threatening
to send my client to prison
under such circumstance i might suggest
if the witness disappears itll help
then it up to them
whether they want to take that path
but
that illegal
youll be surprised
at what people will do
to save their loved ones from prison
so what do you suggest for me
this path is not for you
this entire situation is because of me
ill do anything to set it right
if you insist
but remember
you asked for it
we must prove
that the serial killer is still out there
how
he must strike again
but that wont happen
his purpose is achieved
if he doesnt
then someone else must
who
whoever
wants to get dr mukherjee out of prison
you mean
me
forget it
forget that i even brought it up
i warned this is not for you
but i promise you
i wont let your husband
be sentenced to death
whatever it takes ill make sure
he only gets life imprisonment
what happened
joy
but a full barricade
should be here okay
mrityunjoy mukherjee im his wife
oh my god how did this happen
some jail inmates attacked
it was an attempt to murder
someone must have paid them to kill him
but who
in such cases it usually
the victim family
this time he survived
but next time he wont
hi im mrityunjoy
im a gynecologist
and a male gynecologist
is like a bald hair stylist
you like tattoos
yup
i made this myself
im a part-time tattoo artist
if you ever want one let me know
no
i dont like tattoos on my body
why
what wrong with tattoos
well
why make graffiti
on the taj mahal
listen youre trying too hard
but im sorry i cant marry you
watch out
hey
what
youre in luck bro
im in a good mood
ive just sent an asshole
to prison
so letting you go off with a warning
warning
if a cop is killed in a hit-and-run
will that prove
that the serial killer is still out
of course not
serial murder means the victim
has to be of the same profile
in our case single pregnant girls
and all killed in the same fashion
in our case after abortion
but why do you ask
ill do whatever it takes
to prove my husband innocent
im on
my parents want to get me married
they made me meet a guy
if you dont like him tell them so
they wont force you to marry anyone
yes
but they wont let me marry you either
why what wrong with me
because they both are surgeons
so they want me also
to marry a surgeon and you
im sorry but youre just a cop
hey so what
ultimately we both save lives
shut up
unless you do something now
our relationship is over
sona what do you want me to do
let elope and get married
are you crazy
youre your parents only child
theyll be heartbroken
dont make excuses
you want to marry me or not
i do but it too early it too sudden
i need some time to think
time to think
while we were dating for so many years
you never thought even once
were you using me
what do you mean using you
are you a candle
that i used and diminished
sick
sona
where are we going
you wanted to run away
and get married run
mass marriage ceremony
oh fuck

our love triangle is going on
you were only trying
to avenge your sister death
but i still dont get
how did you find me
what funny

must be really funny
if it made you laugh at a time like this
very funny
want to listen
oh fuck
i love comedy
let start come on cant wait
i was in love with sona
i wanted to marry her
that not fair
sounds like romance you promised comedy
this is not fair
have patience doctor
it coming
but before i could marry sona
i got the news of my sister murder
when i rushed back home
and investigated i learned
she had recently met a gynecologist
which was odd
as she was unmarried
fuck
doctor
excuse me doctor
so youre that cop
you didnt die
no doctor
but thanks to you
i was in coma for two years
thriller
look im losing patience
where the comedy
coming soon doctor
when i regained consciousness the first
thing i did was try to contact sona
but i learnt she had to marry
the guy her parents had chosen
tragedy okay
he has given everything but comedy
where is the fucking comedy
where is the comedy i want comedy
calm down doctor this is the spice
it has everything now comes the comedy
though sad about losing her
i was happy that now i could
dedicate all my time after you
i learnt you had settled in this town
but didnt have any evidence on you
so i took my posting here
to catch you in the act
but after coming here what do i see
the love of my life
had married the hate of my life
what a fucking joke
oh dear
oh
oh fuck
very funny
but what even more funny
is you still never found
any evidence against me
i was fed up of waiting for it
so i planted them and nailed you
okay that enough
that enough
so now
now that romance
thriller tragedy and comedy is over
okay
time for some
action
and since a bengali is at the helm
of this action sequence
mrityunjoy mukherjee that is moi

are of prime importance
appropriate lighting
appropriate music

and if it were not for you
this idiot
would never have realized my worth
guilty as charged
all thanks to you

and
maybe you two
should also think of starting a new life
hello

but if it any consolation it entirely
possible for you to get pregnant again

namiya general store
small town musician
stay here
not sure if youre still in business
please excuse my impudence
my dream is to make good music
a musician
friends i once jammed with at bars
have released albums and headlined gigs
but i am still a nobody
i am my family only son
dad has just been taken ill
so i came home
in fact dad will soon retire
he has arranged for me to take his job
but im not giving up on my dreams
i dont know who else to talk to
if you happen to read this letter
i hope to get your advice
what
a corner store with no name
dubbed the namiya store by the locals
one can seek counseling there
by dropping off questions
at the front door
replies will be posted on
the wall the next day
if the question is personal
the reply is put in a
milk box at the back
this is 993
the no name corner store is namiya
i yes i know
must be an old letter you know
it got stuck and just fell down now
but this looks brand new
no smudges or stains
how can it be old
maybe this guy
didnt know the store was closed
so he writes in
hoping to get advice
bro
what era are we living in
who would still write letters
stop this nonsense
go to sleep
we leave at first light
well
will that musician give up his dream
i dont know
but to give up
is as hard as to carry on
if you were him
how would you choose
i have nothing to linger on
and nothing to let go of
wanna write a reply for the store
why not
what wrong with you two
paper
now that weve read his letter
we might as well give him a reply
stop this bullshit
have you thought about getting caught
since he wont come for
it until tomorrow
well be gone by then
id say
my dear buddies
take a good look at yourselves
know what kind of mess we are in
can you listen to me for once
fine
okay
write
your dad wants you to take over
so to hell with your music career
or you could live stream your singalongs
and hope you hit it big
as an internet celeb
well
happy now
where did you leave the letter
milk box at the back
just like the papers say
not this one right
he doesnt know what internet celeb
or live stream means
never heard of them
it been barely a minute
how did he manage to reply
it a few days
what do you mean
he said it in his letter
i thought it over for
days before replying
im telling you
i sense bad vibes the
minute i set foot here
no
wed better leave
let go
hang on
now what
i have an idea
xiao bo you write to explain
about the internet and live streaming
here
xiao bo
xiao bo
why did you come out
get back in
so nobody came to the back
but the letter in the milk box is gone
nobody came to the front either
right
still the third letter arrived
he doesnt know what a cell phone is
i cant stay anymore let go
we have to find out what is going on
let go
go
he sent us a letter
i want to give a reply to help him
fine
have fun
i am leaving
hungry
i thought youd left for good
i knew it
i cant leave you alone for a minute
what are you talking about
you were gone for nearly two hours
xiao bo almost passed out with hunger
i just saw an announcement posted online
saying that this general store
will revive for one night tonight
from midnight until sunrise
anyone who has received advice before
can again
write to the store-owner
xiao bo what is it
what the matter
oh my god
he is choking
hold still
stop making me worried
no one is stealing your biscuits
what the matter
what is it
the shadow
i measured it when i first got here
it been a while
since we came inside
the shadow should have gotten longer
no i only went out for a moment
didnt i
i checked my phone when i left
it was just past midnight
i even thought it was broken
impossible
you were gone for a lot longer
time runs slower
you said you saw an online post
announcing the store
revival for a night
yes
but when i left here
i didnt see anybody
but didnt we get the musician reply
maybe
this place is haunted
in order to answer your questions
id like to know more about you
try closing the door
one two three
this man uses a pager
watches the drama
the legend of white snake
what is smog
he doesnt know what smog is
beijing is bidding to
host the 2000 olympics
can this man be actually from the 90s
we just found out
by closing the back door
the letter in the milk
box will disappear
so i think
the back door is an on-off switch
what switch
to access the time portal
right
the portal is right here
xiao bo let write back
to encourage him
to hold on to his dreams
stop this nonsense
let say he from the 90s
he never made big-time
during all these years from around here
only zhang wei wei made
a name for herself
and she is a girl
is only outcome that matters
wouldnt it be great if
he pursued his dreams
you can sit around twiddling your thumbs
who are you to judge anyone
sure write him back
i wont stop you
but can he make a living with music
greetings namiya store
not sure if youre still in business
please excuse my impudence
my dream is to make good music
for three years
i fought hard in beijing
i stayed up all night
to write you a passionate poem
i see autumn like songbirds
perching disorderly on poplar
the red crow on your body squeals
breathing tenderly
i can see an arrogant knight
riding out from a white castle
as love reaches the emerald sea
i can see the succulent ginkgos
dangling from her shoulders
with breath as a breeze
with cherries like the eyes of pigeons
let your voice shiver more
sound more desperate
you should know
this is a weird sensation
dont look at her look at the sky
what are you drawing
how many times have you started over
where is your hometown
can you hear me
get ready
go
the flower of youth blossoms and withers
tiring me out but i have no regrets
the rain and snow of four
seasons flutter in the air
fascinating me but i pine away
the soft wind and the supple dream
are dazedly gentle
stop
look
for someone who so out of touch
you should try rock n roll
that might work better
cmon show me
sing with anger
free that rage from your heart
go
get ready
five six seven go
ive heard about but
not seen 25000 miles
yes go on
who knows if it is easy or not
move forward with head
down to find the real me
fire it up
again
walking back and forth losing myself
once more
rifles and millet are everything
canons and bombers are truths
not bad chuan
now were rocking
cui jian i love you
friends i once jammed with at bars
have released albums and headlined gigs
but i am still a nobody
what up
after rehearsing for three years
im finally ready
you must come tomorrow
we have to go now
will you come for the play
im afraid not
we have to catch a plane to usa
see you on broadway
well tour the us next
bye bye
take care
qin lang
bye bye
mr poet what are you doing
sunbathing
i love you like i love my motherland
but youve forsaken
the yangtze and yellow river
a pigeon as your parting gift
to hell with your yankee
qin lang phone call for you
hurry up you slacker
who is it
i am my family only son
dad has just been taken ill
so i came home
brother
my lang is back
you wear your hair so long
like a savage
look your son is back
why the fuss
what can happen to me
brother
you didnt bring much with you
are you not planning to stay
in fact dad will retire soon
he has arranged for me to take his job
to work in the same factory unit
but im not giving up on my dreams
boss
lang
how is your music career
ive been composing
when you have a dream
the whole world is your stage
who said that
the old man at the corner store
remember him
who
here
oh yes
he even gave an interview a while ago
is it still open
i think it closed now
we used to draw on his walls
yes were a nuisance
the old man would come and scold us
kids if you want to draw
please draw better
i dont know who else to talk to
if you happen to read this letter
i hope to get your advice
small town musician
internet celeb
live stream
dont drink
you just got better
what are your plans
after you have recovered
i will go back to beijing
dont worry about me
think about yourself
i know what im doing
when you quit school for beijing
you assured us
that youd succeed
then why are you bumming around
not me
making music is not as
simple as you think
you wont understand
of course we wont
but i can tell
you talk louder than you sing
brother
lang
sit down
everyone should have dreams
but life must go on
maybe take over your father job
it not so bad
uncle
come here
where have you been
what happened
dont you know dad has a heart problem
it can relapse anytime
brother
your health is deteriorating
shall we ask qin lang to come back
im fine
i can return to work in days
stay off qin lang
i know you love your son
but the way he living his life
can he even support himself
he cant just
bum around in beijing forever
if you feel awkward
i can talk to him
let him decide what to do with himself
when even i didnt speak up
he doesnt need your parenting
fine
fine
brother please calm down
forget what i said
you dont have to
worry about my problems
maybe it is better for me to stay home
anyone there
no one
thanks for lending an ear to my problems
and giving me replies
in fact i just wrote a song
the lyrics arent done yet
so ive never performed it
but it is the song i love most
i want to play it for
you with my harmonica
as my way of saying thanks
isnt that zhang wei wei reborn
it her big hit
she sings it well
you all know the story behind this song
maybe he should have given up
then he wont
and no future for zhang wei wei
to tell you the truth
i never wanted you to succeed me
but if your mind is made up
then so be it
im your father
can i not know what youre thinking
what wrong with me staying
big talk
save it until you reach your goal
go back to beijing
and give it everything
try your best
dont give up even if you stumble
otherwise
dont come back here
do you understand
yes
are you sure
if someday
you can choose
to relive your life or to continue
i dont know if your answer
will be your true sensation
or just a deception
i hope from blue sky to fame and fortune
everything that you want
will not vanish with the wind
they come and go
freely like dust
let me tell you
i once had problems
who is that
that madam zhang
she founded the house of rainbows
20 years ago
and she raised all the children here
that why were all zhangs
after she passed away
it became my duty to look after them
right up to this day
those who have moved on
often come back to visit
and bring money food clothes
everything
older kids will help the young
seniors will help newcomers
i performed all over the country
i dont know why
but i feel most at home in this place
right
i think the madam is
always watching over us
i bored you
anyway
thank you for performing here
we all had a good time
i should be thanking you
for letting me sing for the children
thank you
the song you sang was really good
thanks
i wrote it
do you like it
does the song have a name
reborn
reborn
it tells your own story
you can tell
isnt that obvious
what is your name
zhang wei wei
if someday
you can choose
to relive your life or to continue
i dont know if your answer
will be your true sensation
or just a deception
i hope from blue sky to fame and fortune
everything that you want
will not vanish with the wind
there a fire
children run
hurry up
go downstairs
hurry up
mr qin run hurry
help
mr zhang take my guitar
mr qin
mr qin
the relentless pursuit of your dreams
will be fully rewarded
trust me
countless people will be
comforted and inspired
by your songs in the future
persist on walking your own path
until that final moment
this last song
was not only my first hit
its composer mr qin lang
also saved my life
he gave me
a second chance to live
and also a career in music
reborn
for you
if someday
you can choose
to relive your life or to continue
i dont know if your answer
will be your true sensation
or just a deception
i hope from blue sky to fame and fortune
everything that you want
will not vanish with the wind
please tell me
dont be silent like a riddle
they come and go
freely like dust
let me tell you
i once had problems

uncle
can i say something
it good that you have a hobby
to kill time
but look at this
youre turning it into a post office
youre getting too
serious with those kids
those kids
despite their horsing around
they actually gave me good feedback
one even wrote me recently from abroad
to thank me
i heard you were interviewed
a few days ago
youre a celebrity now
it no good being famous
best to live a life of anonymity
ive asked you many times
to move in
and live with us
you live so far away
how can we look after you
we get worried
enjoy your own lives
ill be fine by myself
i dont want to be a burden
i read your letter please ask
mr jackson to pick up the letter
mr jackson
im not sure if my
interpretation is correct
however do not worry
ill answer all your questions
and keep them secret
can you tell me
why you are so sad
where have you been all day
are we moving
we are taking you on a trip
mom and dad are acting strange
theyre planning to take me away
im really disgusted with them
id rather be left on my own
than keep living with them
i dont know what i should do
where are my cds
sold
how could you sell my stuff
without my permission
kid
no matter what
your family is still your bedrock
never walk out on them
when a family stays together
it can overcome all odds
does it still hurt
i was wrong to hit you
as long as you behave
ill never lay a finger on you
i have something important to tell you
you must not tell anyone
pretty soon youll start grade school
so it a good time to move south
and find you a better school
you are lying
you just wanted to move
this conversation stays between us
only pack what important to you
ive arranged everything for you and mom
you didnt say it but i know you hate me
you think im a loser
but i promise you
before long
we will prosper again like before
i care for nothing but this family
for this family
i will do anything
even giving up my life
a 3-year-old american boy
jordan chandler
has accused the famous pop star
michael jackson of sexual assault
jackson has denied the accusation
allegedly since 992
jackson has invited children to visit
his neverland ranch
this is not suitable for children
x-rated
neverland ranch is to make
up for his lost childhood
his fans from around the world
are stunned
if the boy family
decides to press charges
whether or not jackson is found guilty
hell have to undergo
lengthy investigations

it too cold for you to make this trip
why
even if id told you
you wouldnt understand
ever since
i closed the store
ive had the same dream
i dreamt of the store
as if it were right in front of me
i saw people from the future

about changes in their lives
strange
it been closed for months
it still spotless
uncle
it late go to bed
go sleep upstairs
i want to stay a little longer

theyre all from the future
the future
michael jackson
im such an old fool
so pathetic
i thought my advice
would bring misfortune to others
why would i have such power
dont say that
everyone now writes to thank you
i
have never helped anyone
when they came to me with a problem
they already knew the answer
but if they dont even try
nothing i write will help them
they have only themselves to thank
who would slip in a blank page
at this ungodly hour
who could that be
let me think it over
what there to think about
take this
read it in the car
also
this is for you
what that for
just take it
besides
these letters from the future
keep them safe for me
uncle why do you want to keep these
heavenly secrets cannot be divulged
okay
ill wait for you in the car
i never married
you are like a son to me
you looked after me
and i am forever grateful
please do me another favor
consider it my last wish
in the next 25 years
do not sell the store
or demolish it
do your best to maintain it
the letters i received
please keep them safe
after 25 years
before the anniversary of my death
announce for me
that the store counseling service
will be back for just
one night until midnight
whoever got advice
from me in the past
is invited to write in
and tell me if the advice they received
had any impact on their lives
also for my funeral
keep it simple
i dont want to be a nuisance
mr zhang congratulations on the show
thank you
in only five years since graduating
you have already achieved recognition
from both home and abroad
among our many budding artists
youve been very fortunate
we know
youre enormously creative
so among all your works
do you have a favorite
it should be my life
are we done
we all know
that you grew up in an orphanage
does this life experience
come through in any of the exhibits
it a common perception
that orphans must have gone through
a life of misery
but i may be an exception
my recollections
are all heart-warming
this feeling is also
reflected in my works
what about your biological parents
relatives
did they influence your works
i mean
i often sense solitude in your work
desperation
cries of anguish
are you trying to seek redemption
through your paintings
mr zhang
well talk again
thank you
mr zhang
mr zhang
congratulations
it beautiful
when you were kids
everyone was scavenging for bottles
but youd draw all day
well it makes an artist out of you
this mural must worth a fortune now
i owe my life
to the house of rainbows
this mural is priceless
whatd you like
this didnt use to be a bar right
it used to be an av shop
since there are more tourists these days
i turned it into an old-time bar
whatd you like
whisky
single malt
thank you
ive collected these
michael lived a tragic life
he was notorious when alive
at least he was cleared in death
june 28 2009
on the day of june 28th
the alleged victim admitted
he falsely accused michael for money
a die-hard fan
hang on
this is part of my collection
i have more at home
even his original imports
where did you get this
let me see
this cd has history
it was during the 90s
i got it from a scrap merchant
he told me
he got it from the home
of a local big shot
what was his name
ive forgotten
but he was a celebrity from around here
really well-known
and rich too
until he couldnt pay the loan sharks
he ran away
it shocked the whole neighborhood
and made the front pages
i kept a copy
come
here
the whole family perished
the man left a death note
hey boss

i have let you down
today we die together

in our next lives
kid
no matter what
you can always count on your family
never walk out on them
when a family stays together
they can overcome anything
i wrote you 25 years ago
i called myself michael jackson
do you still remember me
i told you
my parents were acting strange
and wanted to take me away
i was disgusted with them
i didnt want to live with them
thank you for not dismissing my drawing
as some bad joke
you gave me sincere advice

when a family stays together
they can overcome anything
i believe you were right
ive had a wonderful life
and i owe it all to you
thank you
the golden voice challenge
go sign up
the deadline coming up
if i enter this contest
and tell them im an orphan
would they let me skip the qualifiers
not unless you blend our hard-luck tales
into your own story
might as well crown me the champ
compared to jie
we are very lucky
whenever he drinks one too much
he talks about his hostess mother
and those hooligans who could be his dad
he was lucky to have made it out
or hed have been killed a long time ago
which song should i sing
reborn
if someday
you can choose
to relive your life or to continue
will you two ever stop
can i get some sleep around here
easy okay
im telling you
do what you want with your music
just dont drag xiao bo down with you
the lost wang wang
the lost wang wang
even the name is ridiculous
dont bother reading
or replying
it wont change anything
what destined to happen will happen
to the namiya store
i work as a hostess
i heard of you by chance
i am a hostess
im nineteen
working in a night club
the place is littered with low lives
but because the pay is good
i do my best to put up with them
what do you want
getting my mail
bullshit
if you have a problem
drop the old man a line
hell leave you a reply in
the milk box the next day
tonight you should understand
destiny will not go away easy
love will not go away easily
with mr su compliment
thank you mr su for your support
here
a toast to mr su
youve been drinking all night
stop it
have a soft drink instead
however
i have an admirer lately
he different from the others
a girl
should treat herself well
thanks
pick anything you fancy
i really hope that
i can have my own shop one day
if you want this shop
you can have it
he wants me to become his lover
i know this is immoral
but he is good to me
the shoes look better
when theyre on your feet
that would be $299
it expensive
wait here your change
keep the change
keep the rest as a tip
consider this my gift to you
thank you
if you can give me some advice
id be grateful
jie
please
dont you think she lost her mind
why does she choose to be a hostess
for dirty money
is it worth it to sacrifice
your feelings
jie please
calm down first
he might not be a lowlife
right
we dont know everything right
you
xiao bo write to her
come here
write down what i say word for word
write
now youre fine with writing back
you said it wouldnt make a difference
i just want to rebuke her
cant i
i think you have misunderstood
im not doing this because of vanity
i need to take care of my family
they can barely make ends meet
i make good money being a hostess
but not all the time
the man said
he could open a shop for me
in the shopping mall he investing in
ive saved up some money
and have been waiting for
an opportunity like this
sis where are the flowers
if you water them with love
flowers will bloom
over here
i think she is shameless
maybe she is like us
unable to find a decent job
cant find a decent job
id be a pauper before a madame
xiao bo write
tell her that the man must be a crook
what if he is genuine
and helps her open a shop
then she wont need to be a hostess
then you tell her
if the man starts asking for money
he is definitely a cheat
everybody knows causeway bay is my turf
right
make sure the fund hits my
hong kong account soon
good
sure no problem
ill treat you to dim sum when i return
okay
i have so many deals to do lately
oh yes
about the shop
i have arranged everything for you
already
moreover
overhead
utilities
product sourcing
ill handle all of that
and you
just need to put up 70000
for the rent
then were all set
err
you need 70000
70000 is not a lot
dont you know
of all the shops in the mall
this one has the best location
in order to secure this shop
ive already
spent hundreds of thousands
remember
no matter how nicely he puts it
once he asks you for money
he is a con artist
go out and ask around
is the shop for real
where the shop that was here before
it went bust
i took over a few days ago
if your heart is tired
tears have run dry
this profound love
is hard to forget or end
but i dont see you anymore
sit down
are you zhang long
who
my surname is su
not zhang
i ask you one more time
are you zhang long
mind your attitude
i am a hong kong citizen
scum
you cant fool me
dont move
big brother
what going on
what your name
let be civil and talk
hold still
where are you taking us
we did nothing
why are you here to stir up my heartbeat
how can i stop loving you
why are you so indifferent
according to the notice
the store revives from
midnight till dawn
if i am not mistaken
the portal will close at daybreak
you were right about him
he was in fact a con man
but i now feel even more lost
other than being a hostess
i really dont know
how else i can support my family
she believed in us
we helped her
we helped her
why arent you happy
what for
now she even more lost
well
what more can we do
how would i know
which year is it over there
grab a pen and some paper
hurry
in fact like you
lowlives like him exist in all ages
dont feel bad about it
in fact like you
i am totally lost
but i want to tell you
no matter what
dont even think of
relying on anyone else
you have to rely on yourself
i cant tell you
how to become financially independent
but being a hostess is not the way out
maybe it hard for you to imagine
in the future people will
stop writing letters like this
the proliferation of
computers and the internet
will shrink our world
the advent of social networks
will make communication much easier
we dont even need to use cash
a cell phone
can handle all of our daily needs
in 20 years china
economy will flourish
stocks real estate it
internet e-commerce
these industries will
develop at light speed
if you study hard now
save up and invest
be a first mover
the better your chances of success are
i have no idea
what happened to her since
you tried your best
let it be
weve received letters from the past
but the notice invites
people from 207 to write in
if
what
if we drop a letter from the front
will it travel back 20 years
do we still have time
stop debating
well know after we tried
quick
get a blank page
blank sheet
hurry up
hurry up
it went through
i really want to know what 993 was like
and what these people looked like
it morning now
the portal is closed
no more letters
so
let go
where to
where did it go
what is this
look
namiya store
greetings
i am the lost wang wang
who wrote you in the winter of 993
your advice changed my life
fixed assets
young lady
tell me
what your major
do you have a major
dont you have a major
what do you study
accounting
yes your major is accounting
my major is accounting
study save up and invest
i did not forget any of them
i did loads of research
invested wisely in technology stocks
and accumulated some cash
i kept pace with the national policy
i soon bought my first property
then my second and third
just as id wished
i bought my late foster
parents house too
in the future that you described
i seem to have made all the right moves
in time
i left my hometown
and set up my own company
i am still learning
to turn risks into opportunities
from a simple food court
to the latest housing developments
ive yet to lose a battle
those awesome prophecies that you made
are all coming true
now i think of it
life is truly a miracle
come in
president
what is it
weve been invited
by binhai north district
to bid for an urban renewal project
binhai
your hometown
please take a look
this is the tender document
also
this is our research
please review it
i dont know if you remember
the reason i wanted money
was to support my big family
when i heard that the house of rainbow
was zoned for urban renewal
i decided to go for it
ill do my utmost to secure this project
i want to tear it down and rebuild it
mr chen
prepare our offer at once
we must win this bid
ms zhang
since you grew up in
the house of rainbows
what do you plan to do with it
ms zhang
how do you do
brother yi
xiao mei
long time no see
welcome
let me introduce
madam zhang niece
im zhang qing mei
nice to meet you
thanks for taking this place over
youre welcome
i lived here
when my foster parents passed away
the house of rainbows is always my home
dont worry
i will take good care of the children
im grateful
madam zhang left these behind
that a young madam zhang
so pretty
he handsome too
who was he
i heard from elder relatives
when my aunt was young
she fell in love with this man
the family was against it
they even planned to elope
but my aunt family locked her in
theyve lost contact since
no wonder madam zhang never got married
what a pity
so what has happened to this man
my grandpa said hed met him once
he was a gentleman
hed written once to my aunt
could this be that letter
in his letter
he asked my aunt to move on without him
after receiving this letter
my aunt decided never to marry
she bought this place
and spent the rest of her life here
the man has moved away
no one heard from him since
they havent seen each other again
no name
during the transition
i accidentally stumbled across
the story of you and madam zhang
be careful
madam zhang founded
the house of rainbows
i became what i am today
because of your advice back then
and i can now repay
the house of rainbows
i feel that you are
both watching over us
so i can grow up in a loving environment
with all my brothers and sisters
madam zhang devoted her life
in providing shelter for
dozens of children
and you
you showed me how to be benevolent
when i can think only of myself
and neglecting the feelings of others
thank you for giving me advice
the fact that i have not repaid you
is my greatest regret
from now on
i endeavor to help more people
from up above
i hope you can feel my aspirations
the lost wang wang
is in fact zhang qing mei
she not closing down
the house of rainbows
we were wrong about her
xiao bo
what wrong xiao bo
say something
brother xiao bo
xiao bo
xiao bo
uncle yi asked us to
bring xiao bo with us
but he wouldnt come out
xiao bo
he hasnt eaten all day
kids you go down first
kids you go down first
watch your step
watch out for the steps
xiao bo
xiao bo
xiao bo are you okay
everyone has left
let go okay
pull yourself together
what do you want
my biological parents abandoned me
my foster parents didnt want me
now even the house of rainbows
is going to be
demolished by zhang qing mei
dont they want to tear it down
they can bury me in the rubble
i can help them tear it down
watch me
xiao bo
damn it
xiao bo
xiao bo
i order you to calm down
are you crazy
tell us what you want
were with you all the way okay
if she wants to demolish rainbows
fine
we will trash her house
hold still
dont move hear me
youve got nerves
youve got nerves
it sad the letter never
reached the old man
the letter was intended for us
there seems to be an invisible force
linking rainbows to this store
let go
ive decided
ill go and sign up
are you confident
how about xiao bo
i want to go to qing mei house
if possible
i hope to have her forgiveness
and you
me
let go find qing mei first
to blank page
to blank page
i am getting old
i thought long and hard
before i realized why you sent me this
maybe im becoming senile
my guess is that you
didnt know what to ask
for those who sought my advice
they usually had specific questions
or should i say
they already come with their own maps
but in most cases
they had no idea where they were
but you sent only a blank page
this shows you didnt have a map
this is indeed disturbing
but what i want to share with you is
after counseling so many people
i discovered that
one must still work hard
in order to attain a better life
the advice i gave in my letters
only meant to reinforce
an already determined heart
the good thing about a blank page
is you can freely draw your own
that is to say
your future is your own
now go and draw your own map
i sincerely hope you
have faith in yourself
create without fear and
sparkle
this is the last reply i write
thank you

my big sister and all

that neither of you
have signed any papers yet

really busy at work

a kidney
so i haven’t wanted
to add to it
by saying gee thanks
for saving my brother’s life
now would you sign
these papers

to the game and all
i came to the game
because of frankie
-he wants to see

yeah i mean it’s not like
it’s a turn-on
what
you having a--a snatch
it’snot--that’s not i guess
a turn-on or anything
yeah yeah
too ugly to fuck
i mean there are
some guys that you know
they had a snatch
i mean you--you know
i don’t know you know
-you lost me
-be grateful
i’m just saying there are
some pretty guys that maybe
just maybe you might
have to consider
what are we
in a turkish prison
well i’m not saying
you’d bypass halle berry
to get to them
but say you’re--
you’re stranded
on a desert island
-like gilligan’s island
-exactly
-i’d do ginger or mary anne
-me too
but what if
they weren’t there
mrs howell
definitely mrs howell
good call old but rich
okay okay
but let’s say
you’re the skipper
and it’s just mr howell
and gilligan
okay guys stop okay
stop
what’s the question
if gilligan had a snatch
is what i’m saying
that’s the option
and we’re moving
right along
okay forget it
-matt damon
-huh
what about matt damon
if matt damon and i
were on a desert island
and he had a snatch
maybe
matt damon hmm
hmm matt damon
is awfully pretty
-very
-agreed
matt damon is
a very pretty man
well i’d do matt damon on
the condition he had a snatch
jesus guys
so you’re saying
we would--
we would bang matt damon
if he had a pussy
-you’ve done worse
-true
yeah matt damon
on a desert island
with a snatch
well i would have
to vote yes
i need to use the head
so it’s agreed
if one of us were trapped
on a desert island
and the only other person
on said desert island
was one very pretty actor
by the name of matt damon
and this said actor
matt damon
had no male genitalia
but in fact a snatch
we would therefore fornicate
with said pretty actor
matt damon
-yes
-if he’d have me
frank jesus guys
is it too much to ask
when you use the toilet
put the seat down
toilet seat slams
woman
i’m sorry but he’s not
in his office
-when do you expect him
-i really can’t
-frank baum
-doctor
what brings you here
i was wondering if you’d like
to give me my penis back
i’d love to
-great when can we schedule
-i can’t
what the hell
i thought
i would love to
but since your operation
i’ve lost my license to perform
surgery in the united states
i might go to bangkok
no no you’re the one
that got me
into this situation
in the first place
i was supposed to donate
my kidney not my--
frank maybe it’s not
such a bad thing
why don’t you take it out
for a test drive
a what
you know take it around
the block a few times
you might like it
no no i don’t wanna test it
i want my dick back
you’d have to talk
to dr weller about that
who--who’s dr weller
i am the head
of the hospital’s
gender reassignment department
and you are
i’m frank baum
of course you
please sit in the other chair
oh that one broken
of course not
please don’t cross your legs
okay
-please don’t do that
-what
-that
-what that
that that stop it now
i insist
-okay stopped
-thank you
now what seems to be
the problem
well first of all
i have a vagina
and a very nice one
i might add congratulations
thank you
but i don’t want it
you should’ve thought
of that before you got it
-what
-tell me
did you give serious
consideration to this
before you had your
gender reassignment
no never for a second
well that seems rather silly
don’t you think
no no no
there’s been a terrible mistake
okay let me guess
your mother was overbearing
and your father was distant
you loved to play with dolls
and put on your mother’s pretty
dresses and high-heeled shoes
every morning
when she went off to work
-never
-not even once
-never
-hmm
doctor if we could
just schedule
the operation
and give it all back
no
-no
-no
-why not
-well it’s not that easy
we don’t just change
someone’s gender willy-nilly
-oh i--i--
i beg to differ you do
-don’t
-do
-don’t
-do did well you did with me
-well i didn’t
-well the other doctor
he did
-ah yes
he doesn’t work here anymore
in fact he’s no longer
even a doctor
i know he told me
-this is all so sad
-i know
not you him
he’s been a surgeon
his whole life
now it’s all down the drain
no more pension
no retirement in florida
wait i’m the one
who was screwed here
-he lost his license
-i lost my dick you prick
whoa hey hey hey hey
i can’t work with you
if you’re gonna be hostile
i’m hostile because you
won’t give me my dick back
i don’t have it
i just wanna be a man again
-are you a misogynist
-of course not i love women
as long as you don’t
have to be one
tell me are you the same way
with blacks as well
-blacks blacks
do you like blacks
-of course
yeah as long as you don’t
have to actually be black
-no no
-would you rather
be a black man
-or a black woman
-neither
my point exactly
i’m sorry you’re just not ready
to be transformed
and until you are i can’t
in all good conscience
approve you
for gender reassignment
this is crazy
you’re crazy
that is exactly the kind of
attitude that is going to delay
your gender reassignment
procedure
oh my god okay
what do i have to do
just--just tell me
what i need to do what
when you are ready to
inhales exhales
heal yourself and calmly
progress down
the path toward gender
reassignment
like a nice calm normal
sane human being
then we can talk
until then i have other
patients to see
this is not over
not over
deep voice
it’s never over
do you suffer from sneezing
and runny eyes every spring
think maybe it’s pollen
or spring fever

indistinct chatter
of the nose and sinus area
caused by the microscopic
-hey frank

problem than that

complaints about you using
the men’s locker room
i’m a man
yeah but with a vagina
and so technically
you shouldn’t even be in there
what you want me to use
the women’s locker room
you’re not supposed
to be in there either
so you don’t want me
to use the men’s locker room
you don’t want me to use
the women’s locker room

is that
it’s just making some people
feel being uncomfortable

to work out here anymore

he crawled with
what he had left
he went down and radioed
for support
that tough sob

i’ve been in combat

but i never saw anything
more beautiful
than you being wheeled
into that operating room
ready to give
one your kidneys

to save a man’s life
not for pay
or patriotic duty
but just because
you’re a man
you’re brave son
real brave
okay
so they took
your junk instead

why you were there
having a penis
makes you a male
but it doesn’t make you a man

him the caning he deserves
not in my presence mr chapman
fine he your problem
you deal with him
ha
thank you sir
fighting eh swearing
these are serious charges
youre ms watson oldest arent you
aye she me stepmom
hmm well i was about to
go inside for a spot of tea
would you like to join me
might there be any biscuits
well there might be let go see
so fighting and swearing
you wouldnt understand
no
how could you youre
the parson and all
i think i might understand
much better than you think
i was once a little boy myself
and i think by the time i was
your age i had been expelled
from two different schools
for fighting and swearing
you never
hmm yes i wasnt always
a church parson you know
in fact ive been a great
many different things in life
ive probably done things
far worse than fighting
and swearing
like what
well i was a cabin boy on a
ship i was a ship captain
later on i was even a slave for a while
nah sir youre leading me on
no im not would you like
to hear a little of my story
well are there more biscuits
hah there might be
yes and more tea as well
of course it was all a very
long time ago you understand
but i dont think that little
boys have really changed
that much do you
i remember my dear
mother as if it were only
a few weeks ago
she taught me to pray
she taught me to read
by reading me the scriptures
she died when i was only six
my father was a merchant
seaman a captain
while im sure that he
loved me in his own way
i dont recall ever feeling loved by him
he soon remarried a beautiful young woman
who bore him other children
she wasnt terribly
interested in me and so
he was away at sea and i
ended up in boarding school
it wasnt long before i was
expelled from that school
for the same sort of
trouble youve been in
do you mean fighting
aye and general disobedience
when i was young i had this
hot core of anger inside of me
that burned all the time
and it was out of control
i couldnt control my actions always
aye
you do understand dont you
it wasnt long before i was
expelled from the next school
for the same thing and my
father decided that the only
thing to be done was to
take me to sea and so i went
on a ship with him when i was
we served as cabin boys
carrying and cleaning
and doing whatever any
grownup sailor wanted done
but that burning core of
anger was still inside me
and when it would burn i
would always end up in trouble
there suck on that young master newton
maybe youll think twice
about slinging blasphemies
around in me galley
i took my anger out
on the other boys the ones
who were smaller than i and
ended up in trouble again
but in spite of the trouble i got into
i grew into a man aboard
merchant ships and i became
an able-bodied seaman
ship leaves next wednesday
for jamaica we can use you
if youll sign on
aye sir i will ill be
visiting in kent for a few days
but i can be back for wednesday
little did i know how
those few days in kent
would affect the rest of
my life for it was there
staying with friends of
my mother that i met
the love of my life my polly
her name was mary mary
catlett and almost from
the first time i saw her
my heart was a captive
my secret nickname for her was polly
my dear polly my beloved
she was a little younger than
i and her beautiful smile
melted my heart and made a
permanent mark upon my soul
mr newton i shall speak
plainly we loved your
dear mother and held her
in the highest regard
mary is too young yet for
any decision but her father
and i do not object to an
understanding provided--
yes
provided that when you
return from your voyages
we will see some signs of
stability and of prospect
prospect
prospect for a living mr
newton is of great importance
yes i shall keep that
in mind mrs catlett
and i shall return
now i went back to sea
with a goal in mind
to make my way to find
advancement to make my fortune
so that i could return
and marry my dear polly
the beautiful memory of her
smile of her sweet face
got me through many long watches
and lonely nights at sea
but even the memory of her smile could not
keep me from trouble that hot
anger burned inside me still
and would boil over at times
send him to the surgery
and you youre on report
reduced rations for a week
and of course i was
a seaman at sea no different
from any other when it
poured i joined heartily
in the sins that waited any sailor
oh
but not all
temptations were in port
ah youre a fool if you
believe all that blatter
all of this can be explained
by reason and science
ah there no god up there
the rationalists have it right
is that what you do
when youre off duty
read philosophers
aye there lots of hours at sea john
lots of time to think hobbes voltaire
they make more sense than a
pack of priests mumbling latin
ah nothing but superstition
to control the rest of us
you should read hobbes ill
loan you his book leviathan
and so i too became
a sailor-philosopher of sorts
spinoza and hobbes often
made quite a deal of sense
and just as often made
me doubt the simple faith
of my childhood
one night at sea i
fell asleep over a book
and i had the strangest dream
one that would come back
to me again and again throughout my life
as long as you preserve this
ring you will be successful
and happy but should you
lose it or part of it
you must only expect sorrow and distress
you believe that ring is magic
as long as i preserve and keep it
i should be happy and successful
are you knocky boy
what a simpleton you believe
anything youre told dont ya
it seemed right
what right about it some
stranger hands you a ring
tells you it magic it a
talisman and you believe him
what a
seriously john how can
you buy such claptrap
you ascribe magical powers
to a wee piece of metal
shaped in a circle
id be ashamed to admit such
superstitions to another man
dont you understand
that by subscribing to
such superstitions it saps your
own human powers of reason
throw it away
go on throw it away
create your own faith
take control of your own
destiny go on throw it away
go on go on show youre a man
aye
oh you are a fool what a
believe anything
youre told but now
youre lost for that ring
contained in it all the mercy
and now it gone at your own hand
what did you do with it
i threw it away
i threw it away
where did you throw it
i brought it back for you
no
if youre to be entrusted
with this ring again
you will soon bring yourself
to the same distress
youre not able to keep it
but i will preserve it for
you and whenever it is
needful i will produce it
on your behalf
it wasnt long
before that voyage was nearing
its end and i would be
able to return to kent
to visit my polly as the ship
turned home all my thoughts
had turned to her and the
prospect of again seeing
her sweet face
but it was not to be
less than five miles from
her house i encountered
a press gang these were
the days of an impeding war
with france and the navy
needed fresh men all the time
press gangs roamed the country
authorized to virtually
kidnap a likely young
lad and press him into
the service of his majesty navy
run it a press gang
aye he awake
welcome to his majesty
navy what your name son
ah john newton
were at sea
aye a day out of
liverpool you was the last
conscript brought on board
here drink something
itll help you feel better
what the ship
hms eridge newly
commissioned man-of-war
under the command of captain carteret
were on our way to france
to defend king and country
were always fighting
with france or spain
ever since eve bit that apple
i was on my ways to
propose to my beloved
ah that a shame four
years well be out i expect
four years
aye
oh
captured carried away from
my love against my will
imprisoned at sea
each day on the ocean took
me further from polly
and increased my resentment
hey johnny johnny
you got to get along with
the other sailors weve
all got our crosses to bear
leave me alone
the smoldering anger that
had always burned in me
was now a fire of resentment
i obeyed orders i did my job
but i did so with a solemn
attitude in my mind god
himself had cheated me
why did you do this to me
am i such a sinner that
you just singled me out
for special punishment
ive nothing to do with you
but i was no fool i soon
perceived that i had a greater
chance of liberty if i was
promoted and so i began to focus
all my rage into hard
work and efforts to please
the officers not because i
had any true respect for them
but because i saw it as my
opportunity for a change
so i started to work hard
aye sir
and i showed officers great respect
newton
aye sir
good job seaman
thank you sir
at least to their faces
fool
you wish to see me sir
aye mr newton
your father a merchant captain
aye sir
ive heard good things
of him he written me
asking that i consider
you for advancement
ive spoken to the mate
and he says that you have
been an exemplary seaman
i try my best sir
that the attitude what
would you say to being promoted
to midshipman
aye sir i would like that very much
didnt think youd refuse
so be it you are promoted
to midshipman
being a midshipman meant
that i was a sort of apprentice
officer and i was set
over my former mates
come on you sluggards get to work
do that mopping i want
that cleaned up
aye sir set the topsail
belay the shrouds
sails mended seamen
while i behaved with perfect
form to my superiors
the rage inside me often
was taken out on the sailors
who were now under me much
as i had once bullied smaller
children
you call that a knot seaman
aye sir figure-of-eight
it a throbbing mess
take it apart and start again
aye sir
talk back and therell be
no rations for you tonight
aye sir
after some months at
sea patrolling the channel
and even fighting skirmishes
with french ships
we had to put back into
plymouth for repairs
and then it was that i had my chance
mr newton while we have
repairs im going to permit
a rotational shore leave for the seamen
im assigning you to go
ashore with them and supervise
to make sure none of desert
aye sir
it was as if the master had
left the cat to guard the cream
ill be back at sunset
anyone not here and ready to
return to the ship shall
be counted as deserting
and youll feel the lash
aye sir
all right off with you
here at last was my
chance to go see my polly
i wasnt much on thinking
things through in those days
and it didnt really occur to me
that desertion would catch up with me
john henry newton
i have a warrant for your
arrest for the desertion
from his majesty navy
mr john newton charged
with desertion from
his majesty royal
navy a charge punishable
by death when found
guilty by court-martial
or lesser punishment by a ship captain
as defined by article 6
of the article of war
captain what shall be the punishment
he shall be demoted
from his present position
and stripped of all rank
he shall be tied to the
main mast and administered
2 lashes with the cat
let each of you witness what
happen to those who desert
from his majesty service
no one shall speak a word to
mr newton for seven days
no one shall show him
favor no one shall share
any ration with him other
than the bread and water
assigned by the galley master
are these instructions clear
aye sir
you got your own now dont
you mr high and mighty
you got nothing more
than what you deserve
enjoy your meal sir
it healing up you can sleep
in the hammock from now on
well have you up swabbing
the deck in no time
mr jensen
master word to mr jensen
mr smythe
master word to mr smythe
and mr newton
but captain sir
i said mr newton sir
master word to mr newton
the captain had
conscripted two gunners from
a passing ship maritime law
required that he replaced them
with able-bodied seamen
so that the civilian ship
would not be shorthanded
this gave captain carteret
the perfect opportunity
to get rid of some troublemakers
able-bodied seamen my
arse two here with scurvy
and one barely recovered from the scourge
well i can tell ya
youll feel the cat again
you disobey on this ship
aye sir
this is a slave ship well
be 8 months on the triangle
serve well and youll be
rewarded serve poorly
and youll be punished understood
aye sir
dismissed
i came to like many
of the sailors of the levant
but the old rage still burned inside me
but now it was directed
all at the captain
that a sloppy bit of
work there mr newton
if that the way you
worked on the eridge
no wonder you got flogged
aye listen up mates ive
come up with a little song
about old mr phelps up here
♫ did you ever see the
lines since you been to sea
♫ let the good ship rock
♫ a benty-leggy captain
with a bent back knee
♫ wobbling down the dock
♫ wobbling down the dock
♫ let the good ship roll and rock
♫ better call a coward
or cower up the wall
♫ wobbling down the dock
♫ wobbling down the dock
♫ let the good ship roll and rock
♫ better call a coward
or cower up the wall
♫ wobbling down the dock
well anchor at the banana
islands in sierra leone
tomorrow ill need a
crew of three to row me in
to meet with the trader
harkness smythe and newton
the following day well
sail to bay
where well load the cargo
i like that
staying here
you like what you see then
do i i bet the young trader
there lives like a king
what not to like
what do you think newton
ah you both are daft
it might be nice for a while
i wanna get back to england
and i wanna see my polly
smythe harkness make ready the boat
newton you stay here with me
mr campbell this is
mr newton the young man
i was telling you about
it a pleasure to meet you mr--
you wont be so pleased
once you understand the deal
ive traded you mr newton
youre gonna stay here
as a servant how do you like
them apples mr funnyman
so youve met the lash
youll meet again soon enough
if you dont serve well
youre my property now
newton and there no way
off this island without me
knowledge or me permission
so dont you go be
getting any bright ideas
you have to be a servant
for me wife serve her well
do as your told and your
life will be much easier
but you buck against and
youll find out just how
hard a life can be
you guards take him to peyai
she always wanted to have
a white man as a slave
and now she got one
he is not much to look at is he
give him a mat and chain
him behind the house
first we must break him
my defiance my sins
had all caught up with me
i was a slave
they gave me only a
little to eat for days
just enough to drink to keep me alive
we take the chains off
today you are peyai slave
do you understand
you must do exactly as she bids
if you try to run away we will hunt you
and chain you if you
disobey you will be whipped
if you try to run away
twice we will kill you
slowly in a way that will make
you wish for death to come
do you understand
yes
now go
and serve your mistress
ah my little white man
oh you must be so terribly
hungry how could you
have treated my little white man so badly
here let me give you some food
you would like something
to eat wouldnt you
im sure you would im
sure you are starving
the food will taste so good
she worked me like a mule
she seemed to take particular
delight in watching me suffer
often making me do chores
that were simply pointless
ah very good now that you
have placed the logs here
put them back and place them
exactly where you found them
newton newton i want
some fresh coconut milk
go bring me some
newton newton
newton
where is my coconut milk newton
i want my coconut milk now
where is he
you are useless even as a slave
for a long time
i felt nothing but hunger
and despair i could never
forget that i was the lowest
form of life on the island
even the native slaves
had thatched huts to live in
while i had to sleep on
the ground under the stars
on the other hand
campbell and peyai lived in
a great brick house at
the center of the island
i was seldom allowed in the big house
and then only to do menial labor
but as long as i obeyed
peyai abusive commands
they fed me a little and
i regained some strength
in mind as well as body
one night i lay looking at
the expanse of the heavens
i began to try and see how
many constellations i could
identify how many stars
i could name this became
a nightly game that became
a private area of freedom
for me and i began to dream
again of my dear polly
my beautiful polly
i wonder if i will ever see her again
then one night it seemed
to me that a group of stars
formed a circle a ring a
constellation i had never seen
before and never since
it may have been my eyes playing a trick
or perhaps a planet had wandered
into an unusual position
visible from this latitude
but that night i could indeed
see a ring a ring like
the one in my dream
youre not able to keep it
but i will preserve it for
you and whenever it is needful
i will produce it on your behalf
during the days when peyai was in a mood
i would work very hard but
then there would be hours
of boredom when there was nothing to do
one day i found a small lime
tree growing near the village
that seemed much like me
beating and starving despairing of life
i adopted that little tree as my own
and began to take care of it
to water and to fertilize it
i found other seedlings and
planted them in what became
my own little garden
one day campbell had me move heavy crates
into the big house i was
alone for a few moments
and there i came upon a
dusty old geometry book
i took it and hit it under my mat
i began in my spare time
to work geometry problems
scratching diagrams in the sand
using the sun and the shadow
of my little lime tree
i calculated the latitude
and longitude of the islands
we were on
which were commonly
called the banana islands
just like the stars like
the little lime tree it gave
me something to focus
on a space that was mine
and mine alone
there was little that i
could do with the knowledge
but the exercise did much
to keep my mind occupied
and sharp
one day when i was tending
to my little garden
and passing the time with
equations written in the sand
mr campbell and peyai
walked down the path
and caught sight of what i was doing
newton what are you doing man
are you growing your own limes
i was terrified that
peyai as cruel as she was
would make me destroy my
little place of sanity
well who knows maybe
one day before those
trees are full grown you can sail back
to england and you can be
the captain of your own boat
then you can come back
here and enjoy the fruits
of your labor
then again perhaps he will
become the king of poland
what is this
do you understand the mathematics
yes sir i taught myself
oh you might not be a
complete waste after all
here are a set of equations
id like for you to solve them
what is it a test
aye if you will i want
to see just how good you are
with these mathematics
sit down sit down
im in need of a clerk to
manage me factory at kittam
they dont very many people
in sierra leone who understand
numbers
factory
aye it me slave
trading post it where
the bombo bring the
slaves from the interior
and make them ready for
transport to the west indies
my brother runs the factory
but he in need of someone
who can keep the accounts
you will go there
you will serve him now
the guard will take you
at kittam my life changed dramatically
i had new clean clothes
to wear angus campbell
treated me well almost as an equal
the bombo treated me with respect
inviting me to their feasts
i thought of polly often
before long i had given up
any hope of ever returning to england
my circumstance had changed from one
of daily despair to one of comfort
i had all i needed food
shelter clothing respect
and even women
thoughts of england faded
and my life in kittam
began to envelop every part of my being
the other settlers even
had an expression for it
they called it going native
what are they saying
it means freedom
but then came the
day when my entire world
would suddenly change again
as if a lightning bolt
had struck
mr newton a man here to see you
mr newton mr john newton
yes
im archibald gother
captain of the hms greyhound
out of liverpool
ah welcome captain gother
are you here to pick up
a shipment
not exactly you see
im here to take you home
me what are you talking about
your father commissioned me to find you
and bring you back to
england whatever the cost
ive been stopping at
every trading post south of
the canaries searching for
you and finally here you are
my father
mr newton
there she is the greyhound
after this we got two more ports of call
to pick up ivory and beeswax
and then we should set sail for liverpool
and for you home
captain gother a month
ago i wouldve told you
i had no hope or even dreams
of seeing england again
i was prepared to live out my days here
perhaps marry a native even
have my grave right here
in west africa if i
believed in god i would say
his hand had brought you here
believe it for who else can it be
and so i began my journey home
not as a crewman but as a
passenger on the greyhound
freed of the duties i was
used to i had many hours
at sea to think to think about my life
to think about life itself
it was during these long hours of leisure
that i discovered a book
the imitation of christ
by thomas a kempis i began reading it
not as a meditational work
but as a work of fiction
and entertainment to pass the time
but as i read the involuntary
suggestion came to me
what if these words were
true what if the faith
of this long dead writer
was in fact a reality
that i simply did not understand
i could not bear the inference
as it related to myself
dimly remembered scripture
verses came unbidden
to my mind especially
fearful passages that speak
of the judgment of those
who know the way of truth
but then depart from it
what if i were one of them
what if the faith i had
abandoned was in fact
the driving reality of the universe
what if god hand had in
fact been the moving force
that brought me to this
point brought gother
to sierra leone to rescue me
what if i had turned
my back on the very god
who sought to save me
i was so caught up in my
own thoughts and meditation
that i had not even been
aware of the storm that
had engulfed us
all hands on deck john
mister hey get that canvas down
pilot down pilot down
get newton get newton
i know where he is
god save us
thank you
i thought back then on that
powerful recurring dream
that had haunted my life
i will preserve it for you
and whenever it is needful
i will produce it on your behalf
we had survived
the most terrifying storm
of my life at sea
but more than that i had
a glimmer of new hope
a spark of faith in my
heart in my darkest moment
i discovered a chance of reconciliation
with a god that i had long
dismissed as mere fiction
that was march 0th 748
a day that i would mark
for the rest of my life
as the day of my conversion
there is little doubt that
our very cargo had saved us
the beeswax and the we carried
being both lighter than water
the greyhound was so swamped
with water that we surely
wouldve sunk if it were
not for the flotation
of the cargo itself
but was god hand not
present even in this detail
as we limped back toward
england tripled with only a few
sails i spent most of my
time reading the scriptures
meditating and praying
to the lord for mercy
and instruction
i began to see my life in
a different perspective
the burning anger that had
driven me as a younger man
was now faded
i began to see that my
entire life was that as
the parable of the prodigal son
not in a figurative way as
most people understand it
but in the most literal reality
land ho
we sighted land on
april 7th the irish island
of tory the next day we landed at swilly
finally i was safely
home after misadventures
that seemed like a storybook
so did you see your father
no
see god ways are very strange
you see the day i arrived in liverpool
i discovered that my father
had shipped out only the day
before for canada hed been appointed
governor of york fort
in hudson bay colony
i never saw him again
how sad
did he know that you were safe
oh yes we were able to write one another
so he knew the whole
story but he died there
in canada and was buried there
and i never saw him again
however god gave me a
new father as it were
joseph manastee who owned the ship that
i had returned on took me under his wing
and treated me as if i were his own son
he got me a commission as first mate
on a trade ship and i did very well
much of the rebellion in my
spirit the burning anger
had been washed away in
africa and i no longer found
myself always attracted to trouble
my new station in life
secure i could at long last
go back to kent and to my polly
my beloved polly
after years of remember
her face as in a dream
i was finally able to marry my dear polly
the love of my life
according to god holy
ordinance and thereto
i give you my truth
with this ring i give you my heart
with my body i give you worship
and with all of my worldly
goods i thee endow
in the name of the father and
the son and the holy ghost
amen
before long my benefactor
joseph manastee promoted me
to captain captain of my own ship
the duke of argyll
the duke of argyll was a slaving ship
so my job as captain was to take the ship
to the west coast of africa very close to
where i had been held captive
myself pick up slaves
there transport them to
the west indies there to
exchange them for molasses
and rum and return those
to england that why we
called it the triangular trade
wait you were a
captain of a slave ship
after you were a slave yourself
how could you do that
youre a very astute young man
no i was infant in the
faith and i really did not
see the evils of the
slave trade at the time
none of us did it was
considered an honorable way
to make a living
but you were held captive
how could you do that
to someone else
it was all too easy
you see attitudes are
starting to change now
but 20 years ago no one
questioned the slave trade
well save the quakers and
a few moravian missionaries
in st thomas
everyone in england that
had any money at all
had it invested in the slave
trade it was very profitable
and where profit is concerned
we turn a blind eye dont we
all i could see at the time
was that as a christian
ship captain my job was to
safely transport the slaves
from one port to the other
and treat them as well
as possible the same as i
might do with a load of cattle
it wasnt an uncommon on
slave ships for almost
a third of them to die
on that middle passage
they were kept chained below
decks fed little food
i prided myself on the fact
that only a few had ever died
on my ships
i devised a routine of regular
exercise for the slaves
so that each day they would
see the sunlight and keep
themselves as fit and healthy as possible
i insisted with mr manastee
that we have sufficient
provisions so that the
slaves could maintain
proper nourishment
and not arrive starved
i did the same with the crew
i was proud that my ship
had one of the best records
for delivering slaves
in good health
we only had a few deaths at
see i felt each one personally
and worked harder on
each voyage to make sure
that both crew and cargo
stayed healthy and fit
it may not seem like
much but it was far more
than most captains did in those days
i engaged the crew in
regular times of worship
ye shall have a song as in the night
when a holy solemnity is kept
and gladness of heart as
when one go with a pipe
to come into the mountain of the lord
to the mighty one of israel
let us pray
it was on this journey
that i had the chance
to return to the banana islands
to my own place of enslavement
i was even able to find
one of the lime trees
that i had planted with my own
hands so many years before
then came my third voyage
in 753 as captain
of the african
we landed in ghana to pick
up a load of 600 slaves
for transport to jamaica
it was on that voyage that
i began to first wonder
about the slave trade
that would be my last voyage
the weather looks good
im gonna sail the day after tomorrow
i shall miss you terribly
i so wish you did not
have to be gone so long
yes i know
but it is the nature of the trade
john
john john
im afraid he suffered a stroke
i could no longer command a ship
how sad
it seemed very hard
at the time but we were
later to understand that
it was a blessing from god
a blessing
yes a blessing you see
when god closes one way
it is often for a reason
that we do not know
or understand captain potter the man who
took over the ship for
me and his entire crew
were killed on that voyage
god preserve us
yes he did preserve us
and it was a deep lesson
because what we thought
was a curse at the time
actually was filled
with much grace
we moved back to polly
family home in kent
for my recuperation
during this time living
in kent i had many hours
of leisure which i often
spent outdoors i had hours
and hours for bible
study and for meditation
i spent many hours discovering
the layers of grace
present in our lord redeeming work
slowly i regained some of my strength
but i knew i would never
again captain a ship
however my knowledge of
the business enabled me
to obtain a position as
tide-surveyor of liverpool
a position of great responsibility
ahoy
surveyor state your cargo
00 barrels of rum and a
hundred barrels of molasses
from the island 75 barrels
i worked for the custom office
and was responsible to
inspect incoming ships
to make sure the proper
import customs were paid
to the government even
with the remaining weakness
from my stroke i could
still discharge the work
with responsibility and
yet have the free time
to study the scriptures as i desired
now that we were settled
in a house in liverpool
i made the most of my free time
i determined to know
nothing but jesus christ
and him crucified as paul
wrote in  corinthians
and i resolved to do
nothing that would not serve
that main purpose
i began to learn greek enough
to allow me to understand
the new testament and the
septuagint and then i began
studying hebrew the following year
i never attained a critical
skill in any of these
languages but i had no goal but to truly
and faithfully understand
the scriptural words
and phrases so that i
could judge for myself
the meaning of any particular passage
together with this i kept up a course
of reading the best writers
of christian theology
i could find
out of this gradually arose a new desire
my mother hope when i was
a child was that i should
enter the ministry
now for the first time i
began to feel a strong calling
in that direction myself
it was not a calling of
which i felt worthy
but i felt in some ways
i was the perfect person to proclaim
the faithful saying from  timothy
that jesus christ came
into the world to save the
chief of sinners
my life had been full of
such remarkable turns
i seemed selected to show
what the lord could do
my initial enthusiasm
was damped by refusal
after refusal to consider
me for ordination
i did not give up easily
but in rapid order
i was turned down by
the established church
by the dissenters by the methodists
and by the presbyterians
though not yet ordained i
began to preach at churches
around liverpool and to be well received
the lord bestows many blessings
upon his people but unless
he likewise gives em a thankful heart
they lose much of the comfort
they might have in them and
this is not only a blessing
in itself but in earnest of more
king david when he was
peacefully settled in
his kingdom purposed
to express his gratitude
by building a place for the arch
i began to receive more and
more invitations to preach
or to speak about my life experiences
polly polly read this
youre to be the pastor of
the parish church of st
peter and st paul in olney
oh john it is an answer to our prayers
i had to wait over seven long years
but finally my dream to
server as a parish pastor
would become true
and that samuel is how
i came to be the pastor
of this parish of course
that was a number of years
ago before you were born
it is quite a story
yes and let it be a lesson to you
for the story that god
has in mind for you may
be very different from
what you have planned
the great adventure is finding
god will for your life
oh i did not know you had company
yes this is samuel
we met in the village
ah arent you ms watson oldest
aye she me stepmom
oh why dont you join us on tuesday
john and i have begun a bible
school for the area children
yes youll improve your
reading skills and at the same
time learn more about the bible
if youre leading it then ill come
oh very good
john please remember that
william cowper is coming
later to work on the poem
yes i do
hmm-mm
mr cowper and i are working
on some spiritual poems
which can be sung to popular
tunes like black-eyed susan
or mad robin
i know them
of course you do
you must be off now
mr newton and mr cowper
have some very important work to do
mr newton
yes
thanks for telling me your story
well thank you
for listening samuel
and youll be here on tuesday
aye ill be here on tuesday
very good very good
here it is
john newton
yes here read it
john newton clerk
once an infidel and libertine
a servant of slaves in africa
was by the rich mercy of our
lord and savior jesus christ
preserved restored and
pardoned and appointed to preach
the faith he had long labored to destroy
he changed my life
a few years later he was
called to st mary roman church
in london
when i was old enough i joined him there
and through him i met william wilberforce
and joined the movement to
abolish the slave trade
it took years the bill
passed parliament in 807
the same year that mr newton died
and the same year that
you were born alexandria
but he lived to see the
abolition of the slave trade
oh so he did it
well not he alone but
many working together
he did change the world
and he changed my life
the life of a little boy
who was hurt and angry
at the world
he taught me something of gentleness
and of god grace
and i hope you have a chance
to learn of that grace as well

before that he locked the
wedding guests into the church
ive seen enough
and the whole class
is yelling yes miss

i thought wed go to the movies

very well
i once knew someone
who only could live by night
although he wasnt really alive
he prowled the night
and drank the blood of humans
until they became like him
at cockcrow he had to be at his home
because sunlight made him wither
or did he melt
he turned to ash

police move aside
this is frazer kelly im
reporting live from metropolis
a melrose avenue lingerie
boutique and a scene
of yet another grizzly
feast by the vampire killer
less than 0 minutes ago
i received an anonymous tip
at the channel 3 news desk
the shocking tip told me
that one of the mannequins
was not a mannequin
at all but a corpse
and very likely the vampire
killer victim number three
weve arrived here
before the police
to bring you this exclusive
you must be michael fury
im lori from the agency
the one youve been
corresponding with
im really sorry i couldnt
meet you at the airport
i got a hot tip from
a friend of mine
and i came right down here
looks like another one
you are michael
fury arent you
the one who been
paying me to investigate
these so-called vampire murders
that right
you had me scared
there for a minute
it just like the others
someone is using
sharpened incisors
to bite into the
necks of the victims
and all the blood
is drained out
but there no evidence
there never any evidence
and they appear no closer
to solving the hideous crimes
i see
now here tonight
another victim
this is frazer kelly
for channel 3 news
now back to the studio
well my car is right here
why dont i take
you to your condo
that really freaked me out
i dont even wanna eat dinner
i tell you it
makes me worry about you
walking out here by yourself
dont think im
gonna work here anymore
yes maam
fill it up please
and the victims are apparently
killed someplace else
maybe the same place every time
and then theyre brought to
the place where theyre found
and the rest you
know from my letters
you want a coke
anyway i found a great place
for you while youre here
it a brand new condo
it unfurnished
that what you
wanted isnt it
have you seen it
i spent a whole
day and night there
really
well after all
our correspondence
i kinda felt like i knew you
my letters were very
business-like as i recall
i know but i
like to read between the lines
i made up a whole
personality for you
i sat in your place
wondering how youd
decorate the living room
which bedroom youd
pick to sleep in
what your bed would look
like things like that
what do you do in the agency
research assistant
on the graveyard shift
all those summaries you sent
me were unusually thorough
well im very
interested in the occult
not just vampires
a lot of things
actually im kind of a
joke around the office
so when your first letter
came in they kinda thought
they thought we
deserved each other
ive read all the vampire books
seen just about every
vampire movie ever made
wouldnt it be incredible
if there really was
a vampire behind all this
you know a lot of people
think it possible
because of the puncture
wounds in the throats
of the three dead girls
well you saw them
they looked just like fang
bites and everyone knows
vampires must kill to live
i think people do
see too many movies
why must what you
call a vampire kill
why couldnt they take
just enough blood to exist
and let their quarry live
quarry
that an interesting
way of putting it
im tired
id like to get
to the apartment
michael
what are you really looking for
im looking for a killer
nice slow pan from
billy blue shirt
and hold beat
beat
now nice slow zoom real
slow real slow yeah
that good
good
yeah
now pull back real
slow yes real slow
hell somethin moved
down there i know it did
looking for something
jesus christ man you
scared the shit outta me

why are you filming nothing
look first of
all this isnt film
it videotape all right
second of all im an artist
i dont have to explain to you
or anybody else in the
world what im doing
huh art
but there nothing
happening down there
youd be surprised what you
can do in the editing process
bam
what your video about
it a goddamn
documentary all right
about the murders
yeah
about the murders
i mean why else
would i be here
at this hour freezing
my ass off huh
and listen dont try and
rip me off all right
that happened to me once before
and i didnt take kindly
to it you understand
first they steal your
ideas then your creativity
and then goes your bank book
and i tell you wha
jesus
now was that strange
or was that strange
oh man
i dont know
jesus christ
get a hold of yourself man
just get a hold of yourself
hey watch out
geez

no forget it um im leaving
just tell van i lost
my nerves okay
oh come on dont be
a chickenshit please
i am chickenshit
and ill wait for you
at drac tonight okay
bye baby
j right from the beginning
j clouds begin to pour
j but we were all too young to
fear the power of the storm
j if we had lost our
hopes we knew our
j dreams would still remain
j because nothing is impossible
j nothing burns like
fire in the rain
j fire in the rain
j thunder rocked the mountains
j lightning cracked the sky
j no one that survived this
hurricane would dare deny
j if fate had played it part
j there would be
nothing to explain
j what was once a
very tiny spark
j is now a blazing
fire in the rain
j fire in the rain
j rain
j now see the sun coming out
j from behind the darkest clouds
j say goodbye to the storm
j as it moves across the sky
j see the fire burning brighter
than it ever has before
j moving close touch the flame
j burn like fire in the rain
j fire in the rain
j fire in the rain
j fire in the rain
j ive heard that
voice before somehow
j cant imagine
j it speaks words without
knowing what they mean
j and ive seen that
face before somewhere
j cant remember
j it seems as if it
happened in a dream
j i laugh and now you know
j that some things never change
j i laugh again because
to me you seem
j so strange
j so strange
j so strange
michael
i took a chance
you might still be awake
come onin
i do my best work at night
do you want a glass of wine
no thank you
your last letter said you were
arranging a list of suspects
i have friends in high places
well a couple anyway
there over 2000
names on that list
amazing
what a city
only the first
they have records of kinkiness
la you know
any conclusions
none that youd
be interested in
try me
not one of them is a vampire
youre right
that doesnt interest me
but youre the believer
what makes you so sure
none of them have
been seen in daylight
oh yes
the lore
cant be seen in mirrors
afraid of garlic
all those sorts of things
is that a smile
youre really obsessed
with this vampire business
put my personal beliefs
aside for a second
i also happen to be a
damn good investigator
and rule one is you work from
a theory that fits the facts
now the facts are weve
got a killer running around
who drains his victim of blood
now what are the possibilities
who drinks blood
nobody said the
killer drinks the blood
puncture wounds
just kinkiness
no
rule two is you dont alter
the facts to fit the theory
the facts say vampire
look the victims bodies
are still at the morgue right
as far as i know
well doesnt legend say
that the vampire
victim becomes a vampire
that depends
look the dead are dead no
matter how they got that way
dead and that all
do you know that some
people believe that the spirit
hangs around for a while
that if you can get
in touch with them
they can tell you things
i suppose
youre one of the people
who believes that
actually i am trying
to get in touch with them
maybe one of the murder
victims can tell me something
i need someone to
investigate the living
let stick to reality
there are all kinds of reality
good luck
let me know when the
spirits talk to you
youre funny huh
i didnt mean to
make fun of you
but you must admit
it a little bizarre
that okay it was worth it
just to see you smile again
i should go
really so soon
why dont you stay and watch
some of this movie with me
more vampires
no thank you
when will i see you again
ill call you in a day or two
jet lag

the afternoon commute home tom
pauline southbound
55 there an accident
in the number two lane
hot new group durango 95
the darkness is his domain
to be seen yet unseen
is no difficult task
for one such as he
the shadow you thought
you did not see
flitting against the walls
of your darkened bedroom
it was there
the sound you could almost hear
his voice in another form
yes
the hiss of distant snakes
though his power over beasts
is great it is not limitless
no sadly no
certain animals do not obey him
indeed would hurt
him if they could
small dogs
especially pekingese
dachshunds cocker spaniels
they are more to my liking
the blood is the life
in truth his blood
is pale as water
pale blood
pale blood
hey lori
are you okay
yeah
let go sit down
though his powers are
greater than his limitations
the night only is his
yet how completely he
dominates the darkness
he can become shadow itself
and flow through windows
like water through cloth
to be heard yet unheard
his voice in another form
yes the hiss of hi jenny
hi
distant snakes
the blood is the life

officer police move aside
this is frazer kelly im
reporting live from metropolis
a melrose avenue lingerie
boutique and a scene
of yet another grizzly
feast by the vampire killer
less than 0 minutes ago
i received an anonymous tip
at the channel 3 news desk
the shocking tip told me
that one of the mannequins
was not a mannequin
at all but a corpse
and very likely the vampire
killer victim number three
weve arrived here
before the police
to bring you this exclusive
you must be michael fury
im lori from the agency
the one youve been
corresponding with
im really sorry i couldnt
meet you at the airport
i got a hot tip from
a friend of mine
and i came right down here
looks like another one
laughs you are michael
fury arent you
the one who been
paying me to investigate
these so-called vampire murders
that right
lori chuckles
you had me scared
there for a minute
it just like the others
someone is using
sharpened incisors
to bite into the
necks of the victims
and all the blood
is drained out
but there no evidence
there never any evidence
frazer and they
appear no closer
to solving the hideous crimes
i see
now here tonight
another victim
this is frazer kelly
for channel 3 news
now back to the studio
well my car is right here
why dont i take
you to your condo
woman that really
freaked me out
i dont even wanna eat dinner
man i tell you it
makes me worry about you
walking out here by yourself
woman dont think im
gonna work here anymore
car engine starts
yes maam
fill it up please
and the victims are apparently
killed someplace else
maybe the same place every time
and then theyre brought to
the place where theyre found
and the rest you
know from my letters
you want a coke
anyway i found a great place
for you while youre here
it a brand new condo
tires screech
it unfurnished
that what you
wanted isnt it
have you seen it
i spent a whole
day and night there
really
well after all
our correspondence
i kinda felt like i knew you
my letters were very
business-like as i recall
i know chuckles but i
like to read between the lines
i made up a whole
personality for you
i sat in your place
wondering how youd
decorate the living room
which bedroom youd
pick to sleep in
what your bed would look
like things like that
what do you do in the agency
research assistant
on the graveyard shift
all those summaries you sent
me were unusually thorough
well im very
interested in the occult
not just vampires
a lot of things
actually im kind of a
joke around the office
so when your first letter
came in they kinda thought--
they thought we
deserved each other
ive read all
the vampire books
seen just about every
vampire movie ever made
wouldnt it be incredible
if there really was
a vampire behind all this
you know a lot of people
think it possible
because of the puncture
wounds in the throats
of the three dead girls
well you saw them
they looked just like fang
bites and everyone knows
vampires must kill to live
i think people do
see too many movies
ominous music
why must what you
call a vampire kill
why couldnt they take
just enough blood to exist
and let their quarry live
quarry
that an interesting
way of putting it
im tired
id like to get
to the apartment
door slams
car engine starts
michael
what are you really looking for
im looking for a killer
car engine starts

muffled radio chatter
muffled radio chatter

ominous tones
fire in the rain
right from the beginning
clouds begin to pour
but we were all too young to
fear the power of the storm
if we had lost our
hopes we knew our
dreams would still remain
because nothing
is impossible
nothing burns like
fire in the rain
fire in the rain
thunder rocked the mountains
lightning cracked the sky
no one that survived this
hurricane would dare deny
if fate had played it part
there would be
nothing to explain
what was once a
very tiny spark
is now a blazing
fire in the rain
fire in the rain
rain
now see the sun coming out
from behind the
darkest clouds
say goodbye to the storm
as it moves across the sky
see the fire burning brighter
than it ever has before
moving close
touch the flame
burn like fire in the rain
fire in the rain
fire in the rain
fire in the rain
lively background chatter
so strange
ive heard that
voice before somehow
cant imagine
it speaks words without
knowing what they mean
and ive seen that
face before somewhere
cant remember
it seems as if it
happened in a dream
i laugh and now you know
that some things
never change
i laugh again because
to me you seem
so strange
so strange
so strange
woman moans

michael
michael i took a chance
you might still be awake
come on in
i do my best work at night
do you want a glass of wine
michael no thank you
your last letter said you were
arranging a list of suspects
i have friends in high places
well a couple anyway
there over 2000
names on that list
mm-hm
amazing
what a city
only the first
they have records of kinkiness
la you know
any conclusions
none that youd
be interested in
michael try me
not one of them is a vampire
youre right
that doesnt interest me
but youre the believer
what makes you so sure
none of them have
been seen in daylight
oh yes
the lore
cant be seen in mirrors
afraid of garlic
all those sorts of things
lori chuckles
is that a smile
youre really obsessed
with this vampire business
put my personal beliefs
aside for a second
i also happen to be a
damn good investigator
and rule one is you work from
a theory that fits the facts
now the facts are weve
got a killer running around
who drains his victim of blood
now what are the possibilities
who drinks blood
nobody said the
killer drinks the blood
puncture wounds
just kinkiness
chuckles no
rule two is you dont alter
the facts to fit the theory
the facts say vampire
look the victims bodies
are still at the morgue right
lori as far as i know
well doesnt legend say
that the vampire
victim becomes a vampire
that depends
look the dead are dead no
matter how they got that way
dead and that all
do you know that some
people believe that the spirit
hangs around for a while
that if you can get
in touch with them
they can tell you things
michael i suppose
youre one of the people
who believes that
actually i am trying
to get in touch with them
maybe one of the murder
victims can tell me something
i need someone to
investigate the living
let stick to reality
there are all
kinds of reality
michael chuckles
good luck
let me know when the
spirits talk to you
chuckles youre funny huh
i didnt mean to
make fun of you
but you must admit
it a little bizarre
that okay it was worth it
just to see you smile again
michael i should go
really so soon
why dont you stay and watch
some of this movie with me
more vampires
no thank you
when will i see you again
ill call you in a day or two
chuckles

your vampire if you find him

the darkness is his domain
to be seen yet unseen
is no difficult task
for one such as he
the shadow you thought
you did not see
flitting against the walls
of your darkened bedroom
it was there
the sound you could almost hear
his voice in another form
yes
the hiss of distant snakes
though his power over beasts
is great it is not limitless
no sadly no
certain animals do not obey him
indeed would hurt
him if they could
small dogs
especially pekingese
dachshunds cocker spaniels
they are more to my liking
the blood is the life
in truth his blood
is pale as water
pale blood
ominous tones
pale blood
eerie tones
hey lori
lori gasps
are you okay
yeah
let go sit down
though his powers are
greater than his limitations
the night only is his
yet how completely he
dominates the darkness
he can become shadow itself
and flow through windows
like water through cloth
to be heard yet unheard
his voice in another form
yes the hiss of--

to waste 000 years
touch the face
wipe away the tears
speak the truth break
the heart that bleeds
stab the back bite
the hand that feeds
fire in the rain
now see the sun coming out
from behind the
darkest clouds

as it moves across the sky

than it ever has before
moving close
touch the flame
burn like fire in the rain
fire in the rain
fire in the rain
fire in the rain

on that heady morning
where from my privileged position
i could hear the birdsong
preceding the sounds of the city
i reflected upon the fortune the audacity
and dare i say it
the ingenuity that had led to my being there
a place where my imagination albeit colourfu
could never have brought me alone
six weeks earlier i had been
a strictly one-woman man
contentedly enamoured of family and homeland
a man whose gaze was never averted
by female passers-by
sixth floor

that afternoon i was back at work
as is only natural
for a man whose destiny
is suddenly shaken
i was perfectly aware that
i was planning for the first time
to betray marthe
and the thought of it appalled me
the stares from colleagues
oblivious to the drama
now unfolding
devoted to their stupid work
nevertheless pierced me
i interpreted them as disapproval
although challenging a society
whose morality i respected
i must confess that
the young lady in red
had set my conscience ablaze
now that enough lucien
ive had it up to here
why wont you answer my letters
what letters i didnt get them

next day
hello godmother
it was thursday
braving marthe questions
i removed my riding boots from
the bag which had been their home
since 958 the year of de gaulle
return to power
although the two events
were entirely unconnected
that summer on lle doleron
having been trained
by enthusiasts
my riding activities
were curtailed
by a falling-out between horseflesh
and my good self
as marthe was quick to point out
i countered tartly that she had
gone back to college
20 years after her last failure
then i kissed her censuring myself
for my fit of anger
thus attired i sallied forth
on the arm of my godmother
with whom i lunched or dined alone
every thursday of my life
i gave no backward glance
but i could feel marthe eyes
following me closely
she was still puzzled
as was the horse
that had to contend with me
i set off at a sedate pace
so that my mount
would stay the distance
but its happy-go-lucky nature
soon led me astray
and thus did it dawn on me that
desirable as women are
horses are high
and forests deep
it personal
would you like to make peace
what do you mean who that
someone who had supper alone
at the recamier
rue recamier
is that you
it is you my mother had an attack
at about 8 pm
i spent the night at ambroise pare
obviously you had
no way of knowing
much better thank you
she up and about

he makes a fuss
by what right
i said until were married
keep your comments to yourself
know what he said
why are you telling us this
if i cant even get a warm welcome
at my son
you want me out too
no but you just turn up
like a tornado
everything was nice and peaceful
so you expect me to write
before visiting
i live next door but i need
an appointment like a patient
look at these men here
theyre staring at you
have you no shame
no shame are you talking to
your mother or mrs luberon
mrs luberon
no shame
what mrs luberon
got to do with it
i know what youre up to
with mrs luberon
women liked simon but they had
to like him discretely
for 35 years hed had
this love affair with his mother
she was his sunshine and his bane
the man who lived with her
was called charles du tillet
his playful stoicism
commanded our respect
mouchy liked to claim he was
an international sports shoe boss
he looked a lot older than he was
he had his reasons
consumed by problems which
with hindsight were academic
my friends failed to realise that
despite my missed rendezvous
i was setting sail for a strange land
populated by just one woman
in matters equestrian
my progress stuttered somewhat
oddly the animal seemed to
sympathise with my predicament
even keeping lookout
behind the locker room
from where alas we saw no sign
of a woman in red
at the ministry my sporting
development went unnoticed
still mrs epseranza behaviour
towards me
remained inexplicably shady
i was racked by questions
i dared not ask her
the advantage their intuition
affords women over men
had maybe alerted her to an intrigue
the day i was mad enough
to call the young lady in red
in her office
it all suggested that mrs esperanza
a wife and mother
was siding with marthe
whom she had never met
whatever the reason
after much thought
i opted to ignore her
despite the provocation
i did suffer however
a short period of depression
come on forwards hey
forwards come on
however futile my search
i was as patient as ever
but it was taking its toll
physically
especially as i had to keep up tennis
which marthe knew
i was so keen on
nevertheless i likened
my predicament to happiness
when compared
to the misfortune of a friend
who always put on
a brave face for us
despite his anxiety
marie-ange had vanished
bouly was camping out at home
with the equipment
lent to him by simon
as for myself just as hope
was slipping away
my life became a fairytale
whoa morning glory
he exquisite i know horses
id seen him many times
in his stall and he
he whoa he
he superb
yes she is beautiful
weve met before
let me see
the ministry
when i signed my contract
are you sure
do you ride often
every day for years now
and you
no only for the last 4 or 5 years
then you must have started as a kid
about the other night
it was cruel but well played
the other night
all right
oh my whip
apologise morning glory
when a horse is stupid
careful morning glory
thanks
youre welcome
now keep still
you forgot that
sorry
excuse me
well then
about time
hey dont rush
sorry i had a puncture
again
your phone was engaged
change your tune or your tires
did a bird bite your knees
no dont you believe me
no
who plays with who
this is the decider
simon is serving come on
just a minute
let him warm up
hell warm up as he plays
give us a break will you
come on serve
ive located the kids
what
and you just say it
i could hardly sing it
where
with their uncle in dunkirk
were not even allowed to warm up
and marie-ange
still underground
ready
if she comes back
do i thrash her
i think that up to you to
simon
dont let me interrupt you
carry on playing boys
play bouly
i just want a word with simon
simon come here
what with all the fur coats
im leaving
do you know what he said
and he woke me too
guess no hints
i dont know
dont tell me this here
where then
this morning that madwoman
stopped me going into your office
mrs paquet
but i was with mr simoni
you lock yourself up with him
when your mum suicidal
mum
there nothing wrong with him
nothing wrong
shall i show you his x-rays
nothing at all ask mrs paquet
but he pays you
so he can just stroll in
do i have to pay money to see you
how much

in front of your friends
what have i done to deserve this

horses are certainly sweeter

dogs are more
horses are colder but wait

no
youll say it a cliche
but with horses
when we climb onto their backs
do we humans
ask their opinion
no

i never married or maybe it
the need to have children

what do you want
it now or never my love
to do what
go away
leave me alone
leave me alone
thisll be disappointing
but i have to be frank
im not as tenacious as moreau
in a sentimental education
really
i have to be tough
very tough i know it hard
to be dumped when youre 40
but lucien raki is out of your life
it for the best
are you for banning hgvs
from the banks of the seine
why do you ask
ive got a job
with a polling organization
so since im here are you for
well i dont know
against
goodbye madam
anyway you gave me a thrill
at that moment
had i sifted through my past
id have had to admit there had been
more pleasant nights
yet in this foreign land
where chance had plunged me
i felt the mad wind of adventure
on the back of my neck
a woman awaited me in london
another in paris while i was
stranded in sleepy brussels
next day
charlotte made light of the fog
and winged her way back to paris
there followed a succession
of thrills
every day between 455 pm
when i left the office
and 550 or 552 pm
when marthe came home
with or without her classmates -
it fair to say that in the hour
we had together
charlotte and i
lived life to the full
alternating exhilarating excursions
with hilarious meetings
charlotte and i cultivated
the mystery of charlotte
she said little about herself
i dared not violate her silences
better still so that she would
never for a moment suspect
the obscenity of my intentions
i was careful never to suggest
that we meet after nightfall
we would part
without leaving an address
her breathless with pleasure
me face puffed-up with desire
meanwhile marthe passed the exams
that had so daunted her
she failed just one oral
and was ready to re-sit
so hard
you wouldnt believe it
i admired her
as for me i was promoted
without exam or intrigue
and given martin-guyot job
when he opted to put
his pension fund to work
i was now head of the whole floor
and my promotion
rather than exciting jealousy
as was the custom
heralded unexpected
friendly overtures
from the more aggressive souls
i was far too busy to seek
an explanation for this upturn
on which although mystified
i congratulated myself
that summer the lives of others
also took a bewitching turn
simon
married off his mother
he was delighted
and we shared his joy
charles married reluctantly
but as mouchy said at the reception
lt the result that matters
the wedding party was rambling
showy and a triumph
whose is this
mine
youre too careless
but the best surprise
of the following week
was the sudden reappearance
of bouly wife and furniture
the reasons for her return
were vague
simon and daniel claimed
they had precipitated
the reunion the evening
i had spent away from paris
but their account of the incident
was confused and contradictory
as for bouly
he thought deep down
that the charm he exuded
was just too powerful
for the poor girl to resist
sad to report that the very next day
he was to be found
fishing in the same waters
for which he had been punished
ill call you in the middle
of the night
and say im mrs luberon
youll come and find them in bed
dont do that
anyway you dont know her name
what is her first name
come on tell us
hyacinthe
we laugh because were stupid

with no kids
who likes horses and traveling
in a month youve got married
and had two 4-year-old daughters
weve traveled as far as
the top of the arc de triomphe
you dont get on horses
rather horses get on top of you
in the country your clothes
are ridiculed by children
and you fly to belgium
while im waiting in london
stop gazing at your shoes
and look at me
after what happened earlier
i want you
like ive never wanted anyone
now why is that
i dont know
i want your hands
i want to see your body unclothed

mum and dad are out im alone
only he isnt at simon
everybody seems to be out
no matter
know when theyll be back
no my dad broke a chair
had fate decreed that i should be
a man of national destiny
the night i had just spent
would have gone down in history
having fuelled my gluttony
with her silences
charlotte said in a second
what i had been unable to say
for a month
come
a wonderful command
that put a spark into my life
but such is the ugliness
of the male soul
that leaving marthe
did not cross my mind
not even for an alimony
amounting to 358% of my salary
after deductions
as it would have others
in my position
simone
simone
what is it
nothing it my husband
he downstairs
your husband

nearly always makes them jump
come on
did she say shed drop by
if only to see the kids
at the junction of rue de tilsitt
and avenue de la grande armee
the building is right on the corner
of the two streets
fire chief commandant claudon
is on the scene with his men
who are trying to reach the ledge
from the roof
who touched the aerial
not me
that chap looks like dad
etienne
be sensible sir
dont stay there
jump be a good lad
come on jump
be a good lad ok
with charlotte gone
i was suddenly troubled
by the thought
that should marthe leave me
it would not be without good reason
nevertheless i took steps
to ensure a soft landing
i counted in my solitude
a large number of women
in the welcoming committee below
i couldnt help noticing
one of them
photographing me
one of those blondes one refers to
as platinum
in actual fact
my ascent had barely begun

﻿
hello
this is lou vinetti
reporting live from kjrx
i dont know if anybody
out there can hear me or not
only hours remain before earth
magnetic field declines to zero
and as most of
you know by now
once that occurs
solar radiation will destroy
the atmosphere
and god be with us all
turn the car off
i think it gone
start the car
dammit
well have to go back
get out of the car now
come on jump
ahhh
no
flights across the globe
have been grounded for 24 hours
as the comet
copernicus passes earth
which will be the largest
celestial object
in recorded history
to pass this close
it is expected to create
a global
electromagnetic disturbance
when the comet was first
discovered six months ago
good morning
hey miss penny
hey cyn
zoe that cynthia order
in the fridge over there
okay
so im taking the science club
on a field trip to watch
the comet
i heard
that very brave of you
youre coming along
too right zoe
yep
dad is letting me off work
early so i can come right dad
i suppose
next up to discuss what
unforeseen dangers
we might be facing we are
joined now via satellite
by our own
dr james mayfield
hey look who on tv
now doctor can you
explain why you believe
it possible that
the comet could hit us
when almost everyone else
has predicted
that it will pass us by
wait a minute
lou all i said was
that you cant
you rule it out
having just passed the sun
gasses in the comet icy core
will be heating
up like a hot spring
it will affect the comet
speed and trajectory
in ways that we just
cant predict
fascinating
now i understand the storm
hazard department
has sent you to northern
alaska to observe
the comet swing-by
that right
well be just inside
the arctic circle where
the comet is expected to pass
over its orbital fulcrum
meaning the closest
it will be to earth
it a very exciting opportunity
for us to observe
geomagnetic anomalies
in the earth magnetic field
thank you doctor
that was local hero and astrophysicist
dr james mayfield
via satellite from alaska
getting a signal
yep
logging in
to the satellite
last two cubans
im saving them for
a special occasion
that against
the law you know
yeah well relax peter
were in alaska
the us trade embargo
says no american citizen
can smoke a cuban cigar
anywhere in the world
alright were in
show time
you could get ten years
good point
i better smoke
both of them
hey pam
satellite link is up
you should be getting
our em readings
copy james
reading it now
across the globe eyes are
looking skyward tonight
millions of teacher and
students in every nation
get the chance to glimpse
something the great
astronomers of the past
could only dream of
okay everyone
id like to show you something
just as our planet
has a magnetic field
so does the comet
geeze
the comet going to be
going past pluto
by the time
this guy finishes
zoe could you come
up here please
hold this up
for me please
so were going to imagine that this
compass is earth
as the comet passes
the magnetic fields interact
creating intense bursts
of electromagnetic waves
which can interfere
with modern technology
so ladies no sulking if your
boyfriend doesnt return
your text
messages tonight
yo it a freaking comet
not your mother undressing
hey move it
leave him alone
hey
hey
hey
stop it
stop it
stop
stop it
youre both going to be
reimbursing the school
for the cost
of a new telescope
this guy started it
miss penny
no i didnt
he was picking on him
it mrs mayfield now and
i dont particularly care
who started it
youre both paying
for a new telescope
ill be contacting your parents about the exact cost
it bad enough you
married my father
now i cant even get
fair treatment in class
go wait by the wait by
the washroom shane
the data is looking
a bit fragmented
the electromagnetic interference
is coming on strong
yeah
our friend copernicus
seems unusually magnetic
where my lighter
viewers are probably experiences
increased interference
as copernicus reaches
what is expected to be
its closest
proximity to earth
comet is at orbital fulcrum
it should be passing over your
area in just a few minutes
we just got word that the comet
has reached orbital fulcrum
this is extraordinary
we will continue
to broadcast
we may lose our signal
we apologize for that
an electromagnetic
storm from the comet
is affecting our electricity
whoa whoa
we just had a surge in
the electron acceleration
the fields em levels
are skyrocketing
the radiation belt is being
pushed in to the atmosphere
pam are you reading this
yes
im measuring a radiation
spike in the belt safe zone
45 million
angstroms and rising
wait that odd
im getting a second
set of separate readings
from the comet
magnify sector lp4
i see something
in the tail
copernicus is fragmenting
a piece of the comet
is breaking away
we cant see anything
can you read
the fragment specs
projectile diameter
is 300 meters
velocity of 30
kilometres a second
what the trajectory
descending at
45 degrees
it going to hit earth
use the belt electron
trajectory to triangulate
a point of impact
working on it
latitude 5
longitude 79
james that only 00 miles
from where you are
james did you hear
what i said
get out of there
notify iew
to issue an alert
repeat notify iew
to issue an alert
pam do you copy
dammit
where is the projected
point of impact
i dont know
i lost her
maybe i can
amplify the signal
shockwave
get back in the car
what the point
were dead
we cant outrun
this blast
avalanche bunker
at the bottom of the hill
what
step on it man
try and put in the data
in case we dont make it
james
peter get out of there
come on
reports of massive damage
and casualties have been
coming in from alaska
northern canada and
eastern russia
communication is still
down throughout
these affected areas
as the death toll rises
were getting estimates
the as many as a quarter million
people may have perished
in this history-making disaster
one piece of
good news to report
local resident
dr james mayfield
has miraculously
survived the blast
despite being within a few
hundred miles of ground zero
when the comet struck
he is expected to be
arriving home today
james
i thought i lost you
it good to be home
hey buddy
hey dad
you okay
yeah
welcome home
thanks
who wants coffee
i would love one
well uh im sure you guys
have lots of science stuff
to talk about
shane i just got home
sit down with us
im kind of tired
i feel like laying down
he got into a fight
and broke a telescope
im making him and the other
kid pay for it
sorry
no no
dont be sorry
i dont envy
either one of you
i wouldnt want
a step-mother for a teacher
or a step-son
for a student
yeah well now that
youre home
youre going to have to do
all the disciplining
otherwise he never going
to let me get close
deal
of all the different
scenarios that could happen
if a comet hit earth
i wonder mr president
does the impact
of the comet create
any lasting effects the public
should be concerned with
were still investigating
that possibility
but right now it doesnt appear that there anything
the public needs
to be worried about
youve gotta be joking
what
a 300 metre projectile hits the planet at 30 kilometres per second
and he saying there
nothing to worry about
maybe he just doesnt want
to scare the public
unlike some people i know
my science advisors
have reported
that the immediate
crisis is over
so the important thing for
the american people to know
is that they are safe
and they can go on about
their daily lives
this is unbelievable
james i know you went through a terrible ordeal in alaska
but youre home now
so let somebody else
do the worrying
for a change
enjoy being with
your family
youre right
youre right as usual
the united states of
america stands
what is that
terrible sound
is it an earthquake
take cover
shane you okay
yeah
what
what
what do you mean
it been classified
just what i said
all the data
we collected in alaska
and uploaded to the government
has been classified
and neither you nor i have
the clearance to access it
in fact we shouldnt
even be talking
about this right now
the whole department
is under a gag order
the tremor we just had
was preceded
by some kind of
em disturbance which could mean
there been serious damage
to the magnetic field
yeah i recorded an
electromagnetic spike earlier
but i didnt know
what caused it
we need the comet data
who classified it
the administration
great
not even a comet hit is
immune to public spin
well maybe there really
was some damage to the field
and they dont want
to disclose it to the public
we need to find out
youve reached the office
of the president
science advisors
due to
extenuating circumstances
this office will not be taking
calls until further notice
what are you doing
up on the roof
tracking the sun
and why would you be
tracking the sun
it not where it
supposed to be
why would you say that
yesterday the sun set
behind eagle peak
what do you mean
it never set
behind the peak
exactly
hello
hey is this shane
yeah who this
it zoe
i was just calling
to tell miss penny
that the pastries are ready
pastries
yeah were donating them for
the school disaster fund drive
so she can pick them
up whenever she wants
okay yeah ill
let her know
okay bye
bye
zoe just called
the pastries for
the fund drive are ready
you want me to go
pick them up for you
that would be
great shane
thank you
can i help you
how it going
good
youre here to pick up the stuff
for your mom right
she not my mom
okay
step-mom
you have my sympathy
id die if my dad married
one of my teachers
hello
hey
my god
what is it
the sun is ten degrees off
where it should be
this time of year
how could that be
okay in like an hour
you still meeting kevin
at the park today
uh yeah
okay bye
here it is
thanks
ill be at the park
with kevin
oh yeah
yeah
ill see you there
cool
hey james
hey lou
i havent had a chance to talk
to you since the interview
so what this great
story youve got for me
remember how we used
to come out here
and watch all
those sunsets
maybe that what you
came out here for
i came out here for
the babes and the booze
do you remember how this
sundial was always
right on the money
yeah i remember
hi shane
hey zoe
what am i chopped liver
so shane buddy
ive got a little problem
because of you
you see this car
my dad making me
sell it to pay
for the stupid
telescope you broke
we broke
whatever
the point is i think we can
settle this little problem
how that
drag race
you win me
you win and ill pay the $4000
we owe for the telescope
i win you pay
come on
what do you think
youre not afraid of getting
your ass whipped are ya
you wouldnt win
ouch
you hear that
greaser boy thinks
he can beat me
let do it
dr mayfield said his
suspicion was first aroused
when he noticed the sun
setting behind eagle peak
now i can tell you from my own
experiences growing up here
that the sun has never
set behind eagle peak before
and then there our
trusty sundial
which has
never been wrong
until today
ready guys
get set
ahhh
ahhh
get out
get out james
james get out
you okay
yeah you alright
i cant believe
what just happened
poor kevin
oh my god
i cant get a reception
what about you
nothing
what is that
it looks like an aurora
here
i thought those things
only happened up north
in places like alaska
something bad is happening
dr
mayfield what exactly is the problem with the axis
changing ten degrees
i mean
so what if the sun sets ten minutes later
a shifted axis tilt means
the earth axis of rotation
is out of alignment
with its magnetic poles
this could have
serious consequences
for the earth magnetic field
the seismic activity
and the electromagnetic
interference with communications
that weve been experiencing
this could all be
just the beginning
the beginning of what
a catastrophic
pole reversal
you mean like what happened a million years ago
when the north and south
poles change places
that right
back to you
yeah
yeah
alright
alright already
james buddy
we are famous
what are you
talking about
you dont know
know what
youre story caught fire
my report was picked up
by all the big networks
really
there is some weird crap
going on all over this country
that the government
does not want to talk about
but your theory
makes more sense
than these
alien invasion stories
so the networks
picked it up
good
maybe it will force the administration to come clean
yeah well anymore
earth-shattering developments
im your man right
see you lou
im your man right
see you lou
im your man
good morning gentlemen
good morning
mr president
good morning
mr president
how are you sir
who leaked the axis
tilt to the press
dr james mayfield sir
mayfield
that your son
isnt it general
yes sir
dr mayfield is my son
then what the heck is he doing
leaking classified information
im sorry sir
im not aware of
his activities
we havent spoken in
nearly five years
you dont say
well maybe now would be a good time for a family reunion
because if you dont put
a muzzle on him we will
what exactly was his
involvement with this
our storm hazard research department contracted dr
mayfield
to monitor the comet
effect on the radiation belt
so wasnt this guy on the same
gag order as everyone else
yes sir and his research
was classified
but to be honest sir
the data he updated
could not have revealed an axis
tilt as it was collected
prior to the comet hit
dont argue semantics
with me doctor
a gag order is
a gag order
i dont need 400 phone calls
coming in to the white house
every hour about a pole reversal that not going to happen
it not going to happen
right dr elman
it a preposterous
thought mr president
the consensus is that
the earth axis
will slowly fall back
in to place as it rotate
glad to hear
however this doomsday hysteria
is exactly why we need
to keep the people in
the dark right now
your son
sir
is he smart
yes sir
how smart is he
too smart for
his own good sir
that what it
sounds like
you better bring him in
yes sir
james
it really happening
all the telltale signs
this is unprecedented
what is
the pole reversal
shane didnt come
home last night
are you sure
yeah
his car not here
his bed hasnt
been slept in
and i cant reach
him on his cell
you said he was going
to the park last night
oh my god
i just heard on the radio
that the park was ripped apart
by a major earthquake
last night
let go
what going on
dr mayfield we need
you to come with us
to the airbase sir
base
for what
i dont know sir but we
have an executive order
to take you to the base
by force if necessary
ill find shane
ill call you as soon as
i know what going on
this way
anything
nothing
this is so weird
i always get
a signal here
hey dad
james
should have known
you were behind this
long time no see
five years
not too long
i guess it
just seemed so to me
did you get my
birthday card
i did
thank you
very considerate
how your son
he must be getting
awfully big by now
yes he is
you probably wouldnt
even recognize him
probably not
have a seat james
so youve caused quite
a stir in washington
how that sir
violating a government
gag order for one thing
i didnt violate
any gag order
that axis shift was
my own research
dont play games
with me james
youre either on the team
or youre not
here we go
you know full well the intent of a government gag order
everything you worked
on was classified
the public has a right
to that information
it not your call james
youre a science rat
you dont make policy
scaring the american
public is against
this country greater good
you think youre
a good soldier
youre just a lapdog
for political bosses
youd probably shoot me
yourself if they told you
it would serve
the greater good
what am i doing here
obviously it not
because you miss me
i had the president of
the united states tell me today
that my son was a national
security risk
so what
he wants to burn me
at the stake
lucky for you
he wants to hear you out
oh you mean he wants
to cover his ass
increased electronic
interference continues
to be reported from
around the world
this new development
coupled with the increase
of reported seismic activity
and the appearance
of what seems to be auroras
around the globe
has many people
figuring for the worst
oh my god
are you guys okay
what happened
where your car
this thin skin is
the earth crust
spinning liquid in
the core is the engine
which generates our
protective magnetic field
dr mayfield we didnt
bring you here
for a geology class
the shift in the axis tilt
caused slippage
of the crust around
the core
consequently the earth is
now out of alignment
with its magnetic field and
the misaligned crust
is causing increased
seismic activity
yes
were aware of all that
we just want to hear
specific evidence
pertaining to your
far-fetched notion
of a pole reversal
im assume youre aware
of beached whales
birds migrating in the wrong direction
bees swarming
yes yes
creatures realigned with
the magnetic field
for navigation were confused
a short-lived result
of the comet
temporary distortion
of the magnetic field
answer me this then
dr elman
why are polar auroras
suddenly appearing
in places they shouldnt
again a temporary distortion
of the magnetic field
similar to what occurs when
there is a bad solar storm
what are we talking
about here gentleman
aurora borealis
auroras normally occur when the earth poles attract solar particles
the fact that so many polar
auroras are appearing elsewhere
indicates that new magnetic
poles are developing
i saw a polar aurora
here last night
we are now sitting
on a magnetic pole
which explains all
the electromagnetic interference
and the seismic activity
weve been having
dr mayfield many strange
anomalies have occurred
in modern times without
catastrophic consequences
these fields are
like rubber bands
they bend
and stretch and thin
but inevitably they always
return to their original state
only this time dr
elman the rubber band has snapped
mr president the mini
poles indicate
a geo-magnetic reversal
has started
as the north and south
poles disintegrate
the magnetic field they
support will collapse
static discharges will create
electromagnetic shockwaves
which will fry
everything electronic
we will be thrown back
into the stone age
the north and south poles
will disappear
remerging at opposite ends
of the globe
at which point our protective
magnetic shield
will be completely gone
exposing us to cosmic rays which
will incinerate the planet
just like what
happened on mars
dr mayfield must
we be so melodramatic
this is real science
mr president
this planet has seen many
geo-magnetic reversals
just not since
weve been here
as a man of science i am sure
you can appreciate the need
for thoughtful
rational discussion;
however your melodrama and
sensational media appearances
gives one the impression that
your intention are perhaps
more to do
with self-promotion
ive had a long day
gentlemen
signing off
what did you expect
james
you just told them the world
was going to end
this isnt global
warming dad
where we can spend years
dragging our feet
and debating the facts
theyll find out
soon enough
wait
that the same sound
i heard just before
the quake last night
stop the car
turn off the car
my god
ive never seen
anything like this
save your data everybody
storm hazards
what just happened
oh my god james
it was a massive 40
kilohertz em pulse surge
unlike anything
weve ever seen
40 kilohertz
yes
all the cities that were
hit were blacked out
and not only that
most of the satellites
in orbit got fried
what could possibly have
created a surge like that
it gotta be connected
to the polar auroras
were the hits random
i dont know yet
we lost power during the spike
which was lucky for us
or else the em surge
would have fried everything
were just getting our
emergency generators going
were pulling up data now
im seeing about two dozen
points where 40 mile wide
electromagnetic waves
struck earth
overlay the locations of
the mini poles on your screen
and tell me
what you see
overlay the locations
of all detected mini poles
oh my god
all the hit areas are
where the mini poles are
then that it
the solar particles
attracted by the poles
are building up massive
electrostatic discharges
pam your office has to tell
all those hit areas to evacuate
including lindenville
the discharges are going
to get much stronger
as the field fails
it going to be hard
to issue an alert
with a global blackout
but well certainly
do our best
can you run a timeline
projection on your mainframe
give me a couple hours
it will take a while
to process the data
james
how do we stop this
i dont know that we can
we just had the first
worldwide blackout in history
and you and none of your brain
trust can explain why
what we know
right now for certain
are that the affected cities
were struck by large
electromagnetic shockwaves
just as dr mayfield
had predicted
general mayfield have you been
able to locate your son yet
not yet sir
he in one of
the blackout areas
well i want to speak with
him as soon as he located
yes mr president
so tell me dr elman
can you still say
with a certainty
that were not experiencing
a pole reversal
i dont have an answer
right now sir
are we going to see
more of this
give me the worst
case scenario
mr president until weve
assembled our teams
i dont want to speculate
on something
that not my area
of expertise
dont try to cover your
ass with me doctor
weve got power outages
across the country
american lives
are at risk
so tell me
to the best of your ability
are we going
to see more of this
i believe so
mr president
then i have no choice
but to declare
federal marshall law
general mayfield--
yes sir
--youll supervise
west coast operations
yes mr president
well start setting up
shelters in the affected areas
james
thank god
did you find shane
yeah he was at the park
ive been trying
to call you
our cell phones
are useless
only the landlines
are working
where is he
in the kitchen
but one of the kids he was
with last night was killed
in the earthquake
oh no
what going on
there no power and i saw
an em wave in the sky
it bad
we have to get out
of lindenville
shane
you okay
what happening dad
is the world
falling apart
no no
just going through
a rough patch
ive packed for us both
im not going with you
what do you mean
im going back
to the base
what
what are you
talking about
why
i have an idea and i have
to talk to the president
i dont want to cyn
i just dont see that
there a choice
you know what
youre right
there is no choice because
your family comes first
no wonder shane doesnt
think you love him
listen to me
this is not a drill
this is the real deal
the survival of the planet
depends on actions
taken in
the next 24 hours
and those so-called government
science advisors
dont have a clue
i have to do this
for us
okay were here
smack in the middle of a mini
pole magnetic centre
the most dangerous place
to be right now
everywhere inside this circle
is going to get bombarded
with em pulses and torn apart
by seismic disturbances
i want you guys out of
this circle as soon as possible
go to this town here
little brook and wait for me
what are you
talking about dad
youre coming right
i cant
i have to go back
to the base
i dont believe it
youre abandoning us
that sucks
shane try to understand
there a global crisis
going on
you think
i dont know that
i saw one of my classmates
crushed to death
in a car last night
i know i know
im sorry
so you dont care if the
same thing happens to us
of course i do
that why
i have to fix this
well be okay
leave me alone
shane come on
if an em wave hits turn
the car off until it passes
the electronics wont be
short-circuited
as long as
the power is off
if the power is on
you and the car will fry
how long will you be
a day maybe two
be careful
yeah
you too
shane
no no no
no no no
take those ear buds off
stay away from electronics
you will get electrocuted
if an em wave hits
im serious
it dangerous
get rid of it
ill see you soon
hey
i love you
everybody is advised
to stay tuned
to this emergency
broadcast channel
federal marshall law
has been declared
lindenville residents are
ordered to evacuate their homes
and take shelter
at lindenville parish
we repeat
why are they telling
everyone to go to the church
didnt dad say it was
dangerous to stay in town
oh what this
road closed
youre supposed to take
shelter in the parish
were going
to little brook
maam we have orders
to divert everyone
to the lindenville parish
that ridiculous
it not even safe there
maam please
just back it up okay
let go
come on
turn the car off
i think it gone
start the car
dammit
well have to go back
get out of the car now
come on jump
ahhh
no
ahh
i cant hold on
yes you can
dont let go
help
anybody help
grab it
come on
we need to evacuate everyone
from the mini pole sites
evacuate
we just started rounding
up people for the shelters
no no no
you cant do that
the plasma charges building up
from the pole reversal
are escaping through
the mini poles
this whole area is going
to get hit worse
and worse
as the field fails
alright
ill notify the soldiers
but communications
have been spotty
what about the president
have you still been
able to contact him
yeah the emergency
hotline is holding up
good
ive got a crazy idea
i need to access storm
hazard mainframe
follow me
storm hazards
pam talk to me
im briefing the president
in a few minutes
james the computer
projection
it not good
i need to see whoever
is in charge
inside this circle is
the most dangerous place
on the west coast
were here
the epicentre
of the mini pole
creating the electromagnetic
and seismic disturbances
we need to move all these
people outside
of this circle to here
where did you get
this information
my husband
dr james mayfield
he a government
astrophysicist
he briefing the president
right now
i havent heard
anything about this
my orders are
to keep everybody here
i know but im telling
you it not safe here
lindenville has become
the magnetic centre
of a mini pole
what is that
a mini pole
no no no
turn the power off
the electricity will
attract the next em pulse
you have to shut
the generator down
shut it down
i dont think so
youre not
listening to me
were in danger here
maam federal marshall law
has been declared
i cant just move hundreds
of people
because you show me some
map with a circle drawn on it
you know what
call general mayfield
hell vouch for everything
ive just said
storm hazard lab
just ran this projection
this is what the magnetic
field normally looks like
this is what it looks like now
punctured by mini poles
this is 2 hours out
24 hours out
48 hours out
magnetic field
at zero gauss
gentlemen
we have two days
before our planet loses
its protective shield
and solar radiation burns
us all to a crisp
anyone here take issue
with dr mayfield projections
no sir
no sir
alright then
so who here has a game plan
to stop this pole reversal
alright
this is the way i see it
what if we detonate a nuclear
explosion of a magnitude
equal to that of which the comet
fragment hit earth
in the opposing hemisphere
so that it pushes back
with equal force
are you crazy
how do we know it wouldnt
make things worse
what about fallout
fallout
the pole reversal
completes in 48 hours
and then
it is bye-bye planet
does anybody else
have a better idea
that what i thought
that comet fragment hit us with
the force of 00 megaton bomb
we dont have
a warhead that powerful
what the most powerful
nuke in the us arsenal
we have a new
50 megaton prototype
that at the nuclear
test site
okay well can formulate
a dual detonation
that will equal 00
and
we cant get through
to the general
communication is down
well we cant just leave
these people here
this place is a
ticking time bomb
i suggest you find
a cot and you chill
anything
nothing yet sir
zoe
hey
when did you get here
just a few minutes ago
excuse me everybody
can i have your
attention please
im cynthia mayfield science
teacher at lindenville high
many of you know that
my husband dr james mayfield
is a respected astrophysicist
he told me that our town
is the epicentre
of the electromagnetic and
seismic disturbances happening
on the west coast
and that it very dangerous
to stay here
we need to move
outside the circle
the nearest safe
town is little brook
you wanna step down
from there maam
how come the soldiers
dont know this
because their
communications are down
theyre completely
in the dark
im not going to ask
you again maam
please listen to me
we could all die here
get her off of there
is it true
if you open your mouth
about this to anyone again
you will be arrested
is that clear
yes
and i dont want
to see that map again
release her
james youll be happy to know
the bomber is on its way
and two 50 megaton warheads
will launch at 600
yes
what do you mean
we lost the plane
yes
thank you
an em pulse took
out the bomber
the warheads
exploded in mid air
they have to try again
send another plane
james the skies
are unflyable
well lose them all
they have to try
send 20 planes
one might get through
james
james youve got to think
of something else fast
there got to
be another way
weve got
to get out of here
why would the soldiers
keep us here if it isnt safe
because they
dont anything
theyre just following
their last orders
communications have
gotten so bad
they cant even contact
their superiors
what do you want to do
dr mayfield was right
when he said
the comet might hit earth
i think we should go
were in
come on
it around here
this one
those poor people
i feel so bad
leaving them
you did everything
you could cyn
gentlemen i have a new plan
that just might work
were going to detonate at
the bottom of the ocean
the marianna trench the deepest
point of the earth crust
dr elman
yes the ocean crust is thin
enough that the blast
could go right through
to lithosphere and yes
it could conceivably push
the planet back into alignment
the marianna trench is over
36000 feet deep doctor
how do you plan
on getting there
submarine
unfortunately doctor we dont
have any that are operational
what do you mean you dont
have any that are operational
em interference crippled
the onboard computers
that control
the nuclear reactors
are you telling me there
not a single sub out there
that right
that not exactly true
general
the russians have an old diesel
sub they still train on
she isnt pretty
but she running
she on the west coast for an international training exercise
open that bunker
i guess theyre still ordering
everyone to the church
shhh
i can hear it
hear what
an em pulse tone
what an em pulse tone
electromagnetic shockwave
it a burst of
electromagnetic energy
coming from the mini pole
that sub should be in
the harbour by now
what is that noise
a pulse tone
cut the engine dad
now
stop the car right now
what was that
there it is
oh my god
turn the car off michael
turn it off
everything electronic has
to be turned off
cell phones mp3 players
everything
get rid of your
watch michael
i hope those guys remember
to cut their engine
cut your engine
cut your engine
cut your engine
i think it passed
michael what wrong
dad are you okay
can you drive
sure
james check the engine
weve got no time
to waste
the battery and
starter are fried
it looks like were an hour
from getting out of the circle
we need to get my
father to a hospital
what wrong
he has a pacemaker
i think the storm
shorted it out
oh god
how are we doing
good
give it a try
it is an honour
general mayfield
captain yolenkov
this is dr james mayfield
captain
i see the resemblance
there are two warheads in
the back of that truck
so we work together
to save world no
yes
dr mayfield will formulate
the detonation sequence
my ship she strong as ox
but not so fast you know
yes we know
the closest town
is clarksville
we past it a
few minutes ago
maybe they have
a hospital
no
dont go back
im okay
just get out
of the circle
oh no
not again
weve gotta get
out of here fast
get out or
ill blow your head off
okay
get out or ill
kill all of you
please my father is
having a heart attack
we need to get him
to a hospital
get out or ill put
him out of his misery
take it easy
were going
get out
ahhh
ugh
dad
what are conditions
in mariana trench
expect seismic activity
like nothing youve ever seen
you should warn your crew
that the steam vents
will be heating up the ocean
causing violent current shifts
all this from rock
hitting earth
technically the comet fragment
was made from ice
but yes
so tell me dr mayfield
you plan to detonate these
bombs at one time
no not exactly
in order to generate 00
megaton explosion
i need to formulate
a detonation sequence
just milliseconds apart
you know that this vessel
cannot outrun such a shockwave
we know
your crew captain
do they know
they have volunteered for
this mission in order
to save their families
outrunning the shockwave
is the least of our worries
it fried shane
you know you cant start a car without the battery
cars in the old days
didnt have batteries
they used to be started
by hand cranks
yeah well we dont have
a hand crank
and this is a modern car
you dont need a battery
to drive either
all we need to do is
capture an electrical charge
that will help ignite
the spark plugs
and where are we going
to get that from
have you ever seen
anything like this
no one has
were witnessing a geological
event that hasnt happened
on a scale
in millions of years
what creates such hell
massive tectonic movements
how will this
affect the mission
well it makes it
nearly impossible
ahhh
ahhh
ahhh
dad
dad
im okay
we have lost one engine
power will be
50 percent
hi
can shane really do what
he says he doing
all i know is shane loves
working with cars
he the biggest greaser
at our school
better hurry up
with that shane
00 meters from bottom
almost in position
dammit
we cannot stay at
this depth very long
do you have
a family captain
of course
that why were going to stay
here as long as it takes
if we die from a crushed
hull or a shockwave
what difference does it make
if we fail
the whole world dies
this is it
were on
okay ive got to set the timer
on the warheads
here it comes
just about done
i dont think i should
be holding this anymore
almost there
shane
done
antenna
tape
come on
we need to move
away shane
shane come on
let go
i feel happy dying knowing it
was to save family on surface
but i am sad that you
must die with your son
until a few days ago
i hadnt seen james
in five years so
were on
it done captain
fire when ready
it will be impossible to
outrun the shockwave
with one engine but at
least well die trying
i think it done
we just have to pray
that one static charge
has been trapped
in the cylinder
come on baby
yeah
youre a genius
weve got the greatest
show on earth here dad
it a scientist dream
isnt it
captain
if you could take us
in to that volcano
a steam funnel might propel us up out of the shockwave path
the hull is not designed
for such temperatures
but what have we got
to lose
our temperature is rising
the heat is
expanding the metal
brace yourselves
ahhh
ahhh
thanks to unprecedented
cooperation between nations
we have survived
the most catastrophic event
to ever threaten our existence
the earth has been healed
the human spirit
has triumphed
despite all that has
been lost
but we will honour
those lost
with our resolve
to rebuild
and we will rejoice in what
we have been given
a chance for a
new beginning
000 am perfect time
and finally our fragile
planet owes a huge debt
to dr james mayfield
he here
dad
this is your grandfather

our next guest is near
and dear to my heart
it actually a story that
i covered when i was
still a local reporter
out in the field
okay okay
i still can remember the
night that the call came into
the news room that a
young mother was missing
i was one of the first
reporters out on the scene
and police were everywhere
searching for answers but
finding very little
it was such a somber scene
and it seemed quite hopeless
fortunately our story
took a turn for the best
im gonna let her come out
and tell the story herself
let bring out
laurie curtis
thank you for having me
thanks for being here
you look great
thanks so do you
and congratulations
on your own show
this is so exciting
you must have been so
scared when you did
decide to make a run for it
yes absolutely
but i kind of looked
at it this way
i knew i was fighting for my
life so id rather take my
chances trying to escape than
to hang around and see what
he had in mind for me
sure sure i can
understand that
so tell us what
happened next
did the police ever
catch up with him
well the police
have been very helpful
i told them everything that
i knew and i even tried
to help them locate
where the barn was
and they were able to
find out who he was
and where he lived
but once they got there
he had been long gone and
unfortunately he been
evading the police i guess
for about a year now
but they assure me
theyre still on the case
it such an
incredible store
youre such an amazing woman
oh well thank you
i give the credit
to the lord
i know that without him
i wouldnt have
gotten through it
i just know that all good
things come from the lord
and that he takes care of us
and i knew if i had faith
that i would see my daughter
and my husband again
so he answered my prayers
here i am

command post also
contact ccbi immediately
yes sir
have them
process the scene
yes sir
460 to dispatch
460 to dispatch
dispatch go ahead copy
im at laurie
curtis place
we have a suspect at large
and he is wounded copy
the laurie curtis place
affirmative
i need any assistance we can
get from any local
police departments
also get the canine unit
en route immediately
we need to lock this
whole area down
do you copy
copy
he back
that exactly
how it happened
and people think im lying
when i talk about it but i
dont even see why i would
make something like that up
well it is pretty
hard to believe
come on man
no im not calling you a
liar or anything im just
saying it pretty stretched
why would she lie about
something like that
i mean it like
something out of a
movie you know
it crazy
well i believe
you madison
thank you lacey
well did they get him
honestly the last thing i
did anybody
shhhh
what i just want to know the
score of the game
shhhh
i heard something
sit down dude
no i thought
i heard it too
yeah me too
maybe it was just
a squirrel or
something you know
yeah it could
have been anything
you know the police
finally found out who the guy
was based on where they
found laurie curtis
apparently he was just a
regular guy according to the
people at his church but he
got in a bad relationship
with some girl and she was
kind of after him
because he had a good job
and some money
and so eventually he figured
it out and he got
fed up with it
so he tried to end it but
she wasnt going that easy
it just the
relationship not working
what not
working about it
all of it
tyler youre going
to have to be a bit more
specific than that
we just seem to be going
in our separate directions
you dont even go to
church with me on sunday
church has nothing
to do with anything
but it does it has a
lot to do with what i feel
were not having
this discussion again
dasha i think it time
you go your way and im just
going to go mine
we can work it out just
like we have
every other time
it hasnt worked
i think it time
for you to leave
no
no
im sorry
youre sorry
youre sorry
for everything that ive
done for you youre sorry
yes
it not over not
until i say it is
so she went to the
police and made some nasty
accusations like hed been
beating her and
things like that
and unfortunately for
him she was
pretty convincing so
he doesnt love me
im sergeant jake lyons
id like to come inside and
ask you a few questions
okay is everything okay
they gave him
five years in prison
he didnt do very well there
the police started getting
really worried because he was
extremely violent and
introverted and so they put
him in isolation
and then about
three years went by
eventually his attorney came
back and proved that his
girlfriend had been lying
and so they set him
free on probation
that still doesnt explain
why someone would go after
people like that though
well people all respond
differently under pressure
and i cant imagine being
convicted of a crime
i didnt commit
it must be awful
yeah
all right you guys
gather around and listen up
here the situation
we got a suspect on the run
probably on foot and we have
strong reason to believe
that he is seriously injured
now i know some of you made
big plans for tonight but i
just cancelled them
relax and here what
we need to do from here
we need more manpower
to aid with the search
let activate a full recall
wake them up if you have to
let get something very
clear right now folks
were going all
night if we have to
i want this guy apprehended
before the sun comes up
now where my map of the
area around highway 56
got it right
here sergeant
all right highway 56 is
here here lake mitchell
and these are the
surrounding woods here
now according to the
report the suspect entered
the woods somewhere
around here
we believe he heading
east towards the highway
okay here what
were going to do
i want units here
here and here
i want to seal off
this entire area
i want check points set up on
any road that leads anywhere
near that highway
is that understood
yes sir
any questions
no sir sir
no sir
let make it happen
you got it sergeant
all right who
in charge here
that would be me
not anymore
how about some coffee
i would love some
i meant get me some
officer simpson get
this man a cup of coffee
so what does the fbi
want with this guy anyway
we believe he involved
in more than just these
local abductions
weve been watching the grid
to see if he was going to
pop up anywhere
i guess he a bit more
obsessed than we thought
anyway we really
want this guy
and i know youve had
mayberry finest working on
the case but the big boys
are here now so you girls
can turn in for the night
catch up on your
beauty sleep perhaps
agent manson you
know what i think
no what that
i think everything was
just fine until you
sergeant sergeant
serge come on now
what the status
on the canine units
um
today would be nice
looks like theyre
all on their way
the first one should be there
in about five minutes and
the rest should
be there in 20
come on people
at this pace wed be lucky if
this guy hasnt managed to
walk to the state line by the
time our net is deployed
look radio them tell
them to step on it
i want everybody there
in ten you got it
yes sir
now let move people
he a good boy
it just seems so wrong
for all of that to happen to
one person
seriously it reminds me
of those sayings that go
around on e-mail like when
someone wrecks their car and
it falls into the river and
just when you think theyre
about to drown all the
sudden they kick in the
windshield and then
they start swimming
i know exactly what
youre talking about
so any ways theyre trying to
get away from this alligator
and theyre able to get away
from the alligator but they
have the missing leg
so theyre trying to go up
this impossible hill and as
soon as they get up the
impossible hill they see
this car like were
going to be safe right
so theyre trying to get to
the car and as soon as they
get to the car the car loses
control hits them
and kills them both
isnt that crazy
that so wrong
that really rough man
hey i didnt
make it up okay
it got a name and it
called something like the
the worst luck award
we know ashley
exactly
but you know what
they are kind of funny
in a morbid way
but theyre sad too
doesnt morbid mean sad
okay ashley
that no squirrel
aah
are you crazy
we have a like a grizzly
squirrel back here and
youre cracking jokes
mocking oh
im so scared
oh luke please save me
please luke
i want you to save me
get off me
you smell horrible
we could have done
without you on this trip
ashley
ashley
hey
hey
come back here
ugh
hold up hold up
what are you thinking man
we could have killed you
yeah what wrong with you
we thought you were
going to kidnap her
youre lucky we
didnt mess you up
oh how sweet
her guardian little angels
what are you
doing here anyway
i thought you had some
competition or something
to go to
no i got out early
so i drove out here
yeah thanks man
i cant believe you
come on guys
i just thought it
would be funny
come on
it was hilarious
attention all units

rendezvous point on the double

serge just got a
radio dispatch from 9
theyre sending
over an audio file

immediate danger

i think he saw me
maam just remain calm

tell them they have a
gopher net deployment

back and relax

whirring overhead

wire hanger so we dont have

ah

got another marshmallow
so i havent seen you
around church much lately
what up
oh um nothing is up
ive just been busy
that all
that cool
i know you got
a lot going on
i just miss
seeing you around
that all
thanks brother dave
who knows
maybe ill be back some day
yeah
just dont wait too
long all right
what do you mean
aw nothing
forget it
no seriously what
do you mean
well you see
this fire here
there this guy and
everybody liked him
i mean a really cool guy
class act
made good grades
had a great girlfriend
even got along good
with his parents
went to church regularly
he just had it
all going for him
and then one day out of
the blue his girlfriend
dumped him
i mean no warning
just like that
and that just sent a
shockwave through his life
one thing started going
bad then another
pretty soon his grades
started to slip
and that led to more fights
with his parents and then
before long he dropped
out of church completely
it so funny how we run
from the one place that can
actually help us you know
anyway this guy life
is in a free fall
i mean even his close friends
have just given up on him
just wrote him off
next thing you know several
weeks have passed and he
sitting at home by
himself depressed
alone in the dark
hadnt even left the house in
a couple days and he just
sitting there by
the fireplace
that the only light
in the entire house
then he hears a
knock at the door
kind of scares him
he knew he hadnt invited
anyone over so he ignores it
a few seconds later
the knock is back
this time a little louder
little more intense
he says all right i didnt
invite anybody over
so he just ignores it
a third time
boom boom boom
even louder
so finally he gets up and he
walks to the door and as he
puts his hand on the doorknob
and opens it he looks out
and sees this huge
dark silhouette
as he peering into the
darkness trying to find out
who it is his eyes adjust
and he sees an old friend
from church standing there
it a freezing cold night
and his friend is just
staring at home and he
says can i come in
and he guys is like
well yeah come on in
so he reluctantly let him
in and they walk into the
living room
again there no lights on
so now there two guys
sitting there staring
at the same fire
neither of them
saying a word
so a few minutes go by
and then a few more
before you know it a
half hour has gone by
these guys have said nothing
finally the friend that
invited himself over gets up
and the guy thinks he
fixing to leave but instead
he walks up to the fireplace
just like this and he takes
those fireplace tongs and
he reaches into the fire and
he grabs one red hot coal
and takes it out and he holds
it up and then he sets it
right in front of them on the
brick hearth and he
just watches it
so his friend looks at it
they stair at it as
it was bright red
and then it turns kind of a
light orange and then a soft
pink and before
long it turns gray
and goes out completely
completely cold
so he stares at that
for a few minutes
and then his friend without
saying a word grabs the same
tongs picks up the coal
that completely lifeless
and he sets it right back
in the middle of the fire
and immediately the coal
burst to life alive with
flame red all the
coals igniting it
and they just stare at
it for a few seconds
and then the guy gets up
pats his friend on the back
and he walks out
without saying a word
and just before he gets to
the door our depressed
friend stops and
says hey wait
youre right
i appreciate what you just
said even though you didnt
speak a word
your sermon came
through loud and clear
i needed that
i have grown cold but i
promise you this ill be
back where i belong among my
friends back in church
this sunday i promise
so what happened next
well since you asked i
watched my friend put his
hand on my doorknob
at the house
he opened it and he let
himself out of my house and
he walked into the
cold night air
that was you
yeah that was me
and by the way ive
kept my promise
ive been back at church ever
since where i belong among
my friends
now when the struggles of
life come my way and the
cares of this world seem to
weigh me down i run to the
place that can help
me and not from it
make sense
oh ok fine
you can all pick me up
this sunday morning
all right
that what im
talkin about
shaggy
that was good
it will be good
to have you back
take that
got any chocolate
little boy grabs his
sister by the hand
he goes up to the door and
he turns the doorknob and he
opens the door
and then he sees this huge
black coffin staring down at
them its mouth just
opening and closing
opening and closing
the little boy and the
little girl they scream
they run to the bathroom
it their last chance
they lock it and the little
boy is so scared he hops
into the bathtub and he
closes the shower curtain
and the little girl is in the
corner just cowering rocking
back and forth
well finally she gets up
and she opens the medicine
cabinet and she grabs the
cough drops and she throws
them at the coffin
and it stops the coffin
lisa that awful
there was nothing scary
about that at all
seriously
i want my life back after
you telling that story
you cant get it back
that scared me you guys
what
what
that scared you
are you serious
that scared you
hey hey can you
guys hear that
yeah it sounds like a
motorcycle or something
who would be riding out
in the woods at night
look i think that
guy just crashed
thud
let go check it out
my gosh
no
no
guys is he ok
what going on
get away from him
get away
back up
back up
let me see your hands
put your hands where
i can see them
you have the right
to remain silent
anything you say can and will
be used against you in a
court of law
if you cant afford an
attorney one will be
appointed to represent you
do you have any questions
do you understand that
your lawyer is
here to see you
over here
step back
let see what
we can do here
i got to tell you with this
kind of evidence you really
could be in here for life
wait
there something i
need to tell you but --
can they hear us
yes were
being monitored
just a minute
write it down
there no way
yeah
your attorney said you
need to make a phone call
you got two minutes
so youre just going to
let me rot here in jail
it not right
one man shouldnt pay
for another man sins
oh really
isnt that what youve been
preaching to me for years
that not fair
and you know it
well life is not
always fair brother
when we hurt when
we ache
when we feel the
sting of pain
when were at a loss
for words
but we know there
something wrong
how can we do anything
how can we do anything
how can we do anything
but praise you alone
you are my god and youll
never change
you are my rock and youll
always remain
when others fall down and
lose their way
you will stay the same
when we dont feel
as strong
when we feel we
cant go wrong
when were frozen
with fear
it your voice we
long to hear
how can we do anything
how can we do anything
how can we do anything but
praise you alone
you are my god and youll
never change
you are my rock and youll
always remain
when others fall down and
the ground falls away
you will stay the same
what happened
what happened
what did we miss
it all good
she probably
upstairs just resting
it all good
where are you guys been
asleep
well kinda
is this pepper spray
yeah
that your protection
is pepper spray
you want me
to try it on you
what an embarrassment
youre pathetic
what i brought the donuts
you are my god and youll
never change
you are my rock and youll
always remain
when others fall down and
the ground falls away
you will stay
you are my god and youll
never change
you are my rock and youll
always remain
when others fall down and
the ground falls away
you will stay the same
waiting
waiting
you havent seen her yet
wow
come on
come on
with all this you
could be in jail for life
wait a minute
before we go any further i
have to ask you something
youre not superman are you
as a matter of fact i am
ok well --
and im off
out of jail
see see
this is what you get
this is my husband
what are you doing here
how did you find me
youre going to pay
cut
cut
heather is down
heather is down
it wasnt on purpose
die
did you get that
this is what happens when
you come on the set
without authorization
bugs were harmed
in the filming
did you get that
how do you
turn the key on
how do you turn the key on
right there
all right amy
duct tape
this really is strong
002 uses
mmm
ive been enjoying your
breath since third street
mmm
fantastic
that a rap
were done
no more
no more
baby put on your
white t-shirt
all thin and warm
and perfect
grab your jeans
and sandals
make the weather
worth it
hike down to the river
grab the rope and
swing right in
my smiling love my
rugged warrior
you own this heart
ill keep it for you
my smiling love my
rugged warrior
god you stun
my senses
i want to drink it all
appalachia to montana
i hear your
creation call

prehistoric worlds
earth a planet seemingly born
to create life to nurture it
to be shaped and colored
by it and to shelter it
and yet of all the organisms
that have ever lived
on earth 985% have gone extinct
because our splendid
sanctuary has been visited
by the apocalypse five times in all
everything we see on earth
today is the end survivor
of at least one or maybe
more mass extinction events
we are the descendants
of those who survived extinction
five times
nearly every living thing was wiped
off the face of the planet
five hells of ice and fire
devastation in the seas
on land and in the air above
after each mass extinction
there always winners survivors
that proliferate to become
the rulers of the earth
after each annihilation the handful
of survivors gave rise to
an explosion of life forms
you have to imagine organisms
that are radically
different to those of today
with some extraordinary forms
from the beautiful
to the bizarre and with an arms race
of predator and prey leading
inevitably to giants
these are the stories
for earth lost worlds
and the fantastic lives and fearsome deaths
of its wondrous creatures
at least 3 /2 billion years ago
life got a toehold on
a still hostile earth
perhaps in a boiling volcanic
pool somewhere on the planet
microbes were born for all we
know alone in the universe
marvelous forms of life would evolve
and colonize every corner of the planet
in a precarious balancing act
an equilibrium so fragile
that a few degrees of change
in the world temperature
could mean disaster
and so it happened
some 450 million years ago
that the first great dying took place
{\an8}at the time during a period known
{\an8}as the ordovician the continents clustered
{\an8}in the southern hemisphere
{\an8}thanks to temperatures just two
degrees warmer than today
{\an8}the icecaps were almost
non-existent and the oceans
{\an8}some 600 meters higher
than their current level
{\an8}it was a very different world to ours
the continents were
barren but in the seas
after billions of years of
simple microscopic life
extraordinary creatures appeared
the oceans played host to
the first earthly paradise
life is boomin
it blowin and goin in the
oceans for sure
so in the ordovician sea
you had animals like trilobites
like little pillbugs
trilobites are moving around
they have eyes
they have legs
they have segmented body parts
and theyre cruisin
around on the seafloor
eating organic matter or
other smaller animals
you also have corals
not the same ones we have today
but different kinds of corals
and there a group of
animals called the crinoids
which we call sea lilies
because they look like plants
but they are in fact animals
they have a place where
they attach to the seafloor
they have a long stem
and it looks like a flower but in fact
it is the body of the animal
in this first eden
at once familiar and
strange the shallows teem
with creatures going about their business
like these fish
some of the first creatures with bones
and these conodonts
which looked like tiny eels
but the conodonts paradise was not
without truly terrifying hunters
like the cephalopods
ancestors to the octopus
these are nasty marine predators
if you are out swimming
with one of those things
it not a pleasant concept
to be eaten by a squid
i mean it reverse calamari right
the calamari eats you
for millions of years life proliferated
in the waters around the continents
but for reasons we still dont understand
the ocean temperatures
dropped by four degrees
causing an abrupt and brutal ice age
{\an8}evaporated seawater that reined down
{\an8}on the land no longer
flowed back to the sea
{\an8}it accumulated as ice
{\an8}as the ice grows the sea level goes down
and so if you live in the
shallow marine ecosystems
and you have a freezing
period which starts
to move the water from
the oceans on to land ice
you decrease the area
where animals can live
and you can get extinctions
after this first cold wave
temperatures started to climb again
the ice melted and sea levels rose
these climate convulsions
pounded the already
weakened creatures that
still clung to life
and the one-two punch of cold and hot put
in motion the first mass
extinction in earth history
by the end of the ordovician
85% of species had been wiped out
but a handful of hardy
survivors made it through
including some of the primitive bony fish
which would navigate a singular pathway
through the tree of life
one for which we should
be eternally grateful
it descendants branched out to give rise
to all the vertebrates
that have ever existed
without it no dinosaur would
ever have walked the earth
no bird would have taken wing
and no mammals or reptiles
would ever have emerged
and there would be no humans
telling the story of life
after this first mass
extinction and the ones to come
life branched out into
billions of different forms
each family each group
each species being part
of a vast spreading tree
there always winners in
the lottery of extinction
and whatever those survivors are
that where the next radiation happens
that where the next
evolutionary burst happens
so if you want a simple way to think
about extinctions on planet earth is
the survivors are the winners
and their descendants are the ones
that populate the next time period
the desolation
of a mass extinction sets the stage
for an evolutionary renaissance
within tens of millions of years
of the ordovician catastrophe
the survivors had given rise to a new
era the devonian
it was a completely new world
full of new prey and new predators
some quite astounding
in the sea we call it the age of fishes
because now the fishes have evolved
and theyre diversifying
and you get some whoppers
and one of the greatest fishes
of all time is this animal
called dunkleosteus
dunkleosteus is the super predator
of the age of fish
right at the top of the food chain
it probably swam in a constant search
for large enough meals
even specimens of its own kind
in the natural history museum in paris
a plaster cast of dunkleosteus
impressive jaw testifies
to the killing power of
this giant of the devonian
this is the well-honed
weapon of a fearsome hunter
paleontologist gael
clement studies placoderms
the large family to which
dunkleosteus belongs
{\an8}this animal part
{\an8}of the group called placoderms which means
{\an8}that they have thick
bony plates under their skin
here we see the jaw
with these sharp points
which are not teeth
because teeth didnt exist yet
it actually the jawbone
which presents this pincer form
so it can crush and chop up
the prey in which it fed
and while dunkleosteus terrorized the seas
the continents were being transformed
the beginning of it on land
theyre little tiny things
and by the end there were forests
the devonian is when you
get a land environment
that starts to look like
something you might recognize
you go from nothing to forests
but trees release water vapor into the air
and may have triggered epic
storms over the continents
torrents swept dead and
decomposing plant matter
into the oceans choking them
oxygen levels plummeted
global cooling and volcanic
turbulence may have
worsened the crisis in the seas as well
for marine life sustenance grew scarce
eventually the food chain collapsed
the devonian extinction strangled 3/4
of the worlds marine life to death
but on land the forests kept thriving
any creature looking
to survive the disaster
at sea would have to seek
greener pastures literally
and that would require
some anatomical innovation
so you have a variety of fish
that actually are
maneuvering their way around
in shallow water
and they have these lobe-like fins
that actually if you look at the fossils
and actually you can start to see the rays
of the fins actually have distinct bones
and it this lineage of fish
that eventually evolves into amphibians
with the seas suffocating
and the lush land beckoning
the menu required updating
pioneering fish like tiktaalik
a descendant of the bony fish that slipped
through the first mass extinction
had already been experimenting with life
where the shallows meet the land
it had gills to breathe in water
but also a primitive lung for breathing air
and four robust fins that
would later become legs
fleeing the choking oceans
tiktaalik and its family
the sarcopterygians crept out of the water
and slithered through the
second great extinction
and the world would never be the same
a new chapter in the history of life began
and again in the race of
life the winners give rise
to new branches of the evolutionary tree
in the new age of the permian
the first modern trees developed
photosynthesis enriched
the air with oxygen
{\an8}at the same time
the continents drifted together
{\an8}to form a supercontinent
pangaea a vast new territory
{\an8}for land-going animals
to explore and exploit
animals unlike anything
the world have ever seen
before evolved to handle
life on terra firma
where conditions like temperature
varied much more wildly
and harshly than in the seas
to protect their offspring
big predators like the gorgonopsians began
to lay the first eggs with hard shells
all the early land animals
walked on four legs
hence the name tetrapods
a body plan that as revolutionary
as any in the story of life
and some were quite flamboyant
what you got are animals
that looked like a big iguana
with a great big sail on its back
it likely that these sails were
for either impressing the other sex
or for moderating heat
you could rotate towards the sun
and your blood is warmed up
by this big warming surface
or you could rotate away from the sun
you can cool it down
these pelycosaurs with their iconic sails
lived alongside dicynodonts
herbivores with a new innovation a beak
designed to excavate the
tough roots on which they fed
these huge animals were probably hunted
by the biggest predators in pangaea
like the titanophoneus or titanic killer
a reptile that could grow
to a length of five meters
in the seas
00 million years after the collapse
of the oceans vibrant
new lifescapes flourished
you wouldve just loved
scuba diving in the permian
and you got all these incredible creatures
that are out swimmin around
there corals
there cephalopods
the fishes have gotten big now
and youve got your first sharks
certainly one of the most amazing
is this animal called helicoprion
it basically had this
whirl of teeth mounted
in its lower jaw
and it would slam into its upper jaw
and it was a slicing mechanism
it swam around in the sea
and it just chopped stuff in half
and then came back and ate it
the massive fossilized teeth
from this buzzsaw shark
suggest it couldve grown
to a length of 2 meters
on land and in the water
the biodiversity of the
permian was simply spectacular
but it was doomed
the most devastating natural catastrophe
the earth has ever seen
so far awaited them
a cataclysm that would
transform this paradise
into hell on earth for millions of years
some 250 million years ago
in what is now siberia
the earth tried to turn itself inside out
these vast cliffs called traps formed
when the planet belched
lava over and over again
for tens of thousands of years
iceland one of the most
volcanically active countries
in the world
is entire built by lava flows
it is an open-air laboratory for geologists
like patrick de wever
and embedded in the rock
he finds the barrels of a
lava flow smoking guns
when there an emission of lava
{\an8}there are holes in the mass of rock
{\an8}and these holes are filled with gases
{\an8}which come out at the
same time as the magma
{\an8}there are different types of gas
there water vapor
there are sulfur oxides and carbon dioxide
we know water vapor is a greenhouse gas
which tends to raise the temperature
as does carbon dioxide
but sulfur oxides have a double effect
on the one hand they cause acid rain
and they also partially block out sunlight
leading to a drop in temperature
and lower light levels
which means a reduction in photosynthesis
and so perhaps fewer plants
and since animals feed on plants
fewer plants mean herbivores start to die
and then in turn
the carnivorous animals die too
the permian-jurassic
extinction was the mother
of all extinctions
basically a lot of our
friends that had been with us
for the entire paleozoic
things like trilobites
the last trilobite goes
lots of these earlier marine organisms
theyve survived through much
of the earlier extinctions
sorry cant make it through
on the other side of the world
in china zhejiang province
researchers sylvie crasquin
and marie-beatrice forel are
in search of one creature
that survived the permian
disaster in the seas
hoping to find the secrets
of how to cheat extinction
here at the dividing line
between the abundant permian
and the disaster-ravaged time just after
the researchers locate
what theyre looking for
tiny crustaceans called ostrocods
ostrocods had an ability to adapt to some
of the most stressed environments
in the history of the planet
in her paris laboratory
sylvie puts her prizes
under the microscope
ostrocods from before the
disaster are pretty large
for miniature marine life
the ones from immediately after are not
{\an8}just after the crisis
{\an8}conditions were extremely harsh
{\an8}you can imagine that ostrocods went
{\an8}into energy-saving mode
meaning they reduced the metabolism
as far as possible to consume less energy
which is why you find smaller ones
which also had smaller eggs
and with reproductions
cycles that are much shorter
than those usually
observed in the paleozoic
after the devastation of the permian
life hit the reset button once again
on land the few tetrapods that survived
descendants of the first
land-going vertebrates
would evolve into reptiles
dinosaurs and mammals
millions of years later
by the start of the triassic
the branches of the tree of
life are once again blossoming
the triassic is a time
of tremendous innovation
because the decks have
been cleared so severely
in the permian-jurassic
so you basically wipe the slate not clean
but pretty clean
the triassic is this really crazy place
where these things now radiate again
into all these different
kinds of shapes and forms
lots of really cool
weird animals in the triassic
in the ocean marine reptiles had emerged
like the ichthyosaurs
which roamed the seas
hunting fish and squid
corals bloomed and built reefs once again
ammonites proliferated
along with sea urchins and starfish
in the skies above
the first flying reptiles
called pterosaurs beat their huge wings
on land great herbivores with
tough leathery armor grazed
in conifer forests
their defensive carapace
hints at the presence
of fearsome predators
like the agile coelophysis
which probably hunted in packs
the two-legged
40-pound coelophysis was one
of the first dinosaurs to grace the earth
it would take tens of millions of years
and another global catastrophe
before giant dinosaurs
completely dominated the world
{\an8}some 200 million years ago
europe and africa tore away
{\an8}from the american continent
forming the atlantic ocean
the earth entered a new
period of volcanic upheaval
it set in motion the fourth mass extinction
in the planet history
wiping out 3/4 of land-dwelling species
and 96% of ocean species
and the great permian
experiment lay in ruins
but once again
life would rise like a phoenix
from the ashes
the dinosaurs survived
the mammals survived
the pterosaurs survived
so on land you have these lineages now
that are off and racing
in the highlands of central south africa
the rocks preserve a
record of this renaissance
and a world dominated by some
of the most massive
animals that ever existed
the mega-dinosaurs
paleontologist jonah choiniere
and his students from
witwatersrand university
in johannesburg are excavating fossils
from the triassic and jurassic periods
that may shed light on this
revolutionary transition
itll come out
while his students extract a fossil
from the triassic jonah goes in search
of sediments from the jurassic
these rocks in this
cliff these are jurassic
so theyre about 200 million years old
{\an8}down below us on the triassic
{\an8}all types of animals
are found in the rocks
{\an8}but as we come up into the jurassic
dinosaurs become much more common
in fact almost everything
we find here is a dinosaur
immediately after the extinction event
dinosaurs are small
but just for a short time
suddenly they explode
into enormous body sizes
and in fact within a few million
years you have things
that are twice the size
of today elephants
in the triassic it anyone game
but as soon as we get into the jurassic
it clear that dinosaurs
are the winners of the day
okay slowly gently
one two three
you guys okay
hey guys
hey just in time
<v ->hi
you flipped it fantastic
okay weve taken bigger ones down before
okay you ready on three two three
most of the fossils collected
in south africa
in the past century are housed
at witwatersrand
university in johannesburg
the wealth of this collection
underlines the sheer variety
of species during the jurassic
the fossils on these shells are the bones
of ladumarahi mafube
a giant dinosaur from south africa
which lived in the jurassic period
about 200 million years ago
and this is the foot bone
of ladumarahi mafube
this is the only known
specimen of ladumarahi
and wed been looking in south africa
for well over 50 years for dinosaurs
the name ledumahadi means
a giant thunderclap
and mafube which is the species
name means dawn
so together it a sesotho term
meaning a giant thunderclap at dawn
we can tell from these bones
that this animal weighed
about 2 tons and that amazing
because it shows that dinosaurs soon
after the end triassic extinction were able
to rebound and attain enormous sizes
we can tell from the bones of ledumahadi
that it mustve walked on all four legs
in fact much like a modern elephant
but with a slightly more
crouched limb posture
this type of dinosaur is a sauropodomorph
and we know that they had long necks
and tiny heads and giant bodies
where they wouldve fermented
the food they swallowed whole
dinosaurs like ledumahadi
wouldve made tremendous advantage
of the openings in the environment
and the ecosystems left vacant
by the end triassic extinction
after life was almost
wiped out in the permian
fascinating new creatures emerged on stage
with the arrival of flowering plants
and pollinating insects
evolution went into overdrive
the development of new species
sparked the genesis of others
herbivores grew larger
and more diversified
along with the carnivores that fed on them
these gigantic suarapods
were the biggest land animals
that have ever lived
some of them as much as 00 feet long
20 feet tall up to 88 tons
these massive incredible animals
during the cretaceous
evolution went to extremes
the jaw of the t-rex exerted so much force
it could crush the bones of its
prey and swallow them whole
the largest flying creatures
the earth has ever seen ruled the skies
pterosaurs whose wing
span could reach 2 meters
and in the oceans
creatures also grew immense
like plesiosaurus a ferocious predator
and then there was the mosasaur
a reptile that grew up to 8 meters
the dinosaurs dominated
the face of the earth
for more than 75 million years
covering two geological periods
the jurassic then the cretaceous
today their only descendants are birds
once again a cataclysm shook the planet
and brought the giants low
{\an8}as the cretaceous drew to its close
{\an8}the world began to
resemble the one we know
{\an8}but india which was not yet
joined to the asian continent
{\an8}underwent a massive volcanic
episode like the one
{\an8}in siberia that ended the permian
the deccan traps bear witness to eruptions
that occurred over several millennia
they date from some 65 million years ago
around the time that the
dinosaurs disappeared
until the 980s
many scientists attributed
the dinosaurs extinction
to this volcanic outburst
then came a theory that was
out of this world literally
that the dinosaur killer
was an extraterrestrial
in 980 this crazy idea was proposed
that an asteroid hit the planet
and caused the extinction
that wiped out the dinosaurs
and we all thought that nuts
that like national enquirer science
little green men come take our dinosaurs
asteroid strikes give me a break
so everybody laughed
thought this is a joke
a joke that scientists would be forced
to take seriously
in the badlands of western canada
paleontologist francois therrien
from the royal tyrrell
museum makes his way down
through millions of years
of fossil-rich sediments
this valley
carved out by the red deer river
has yielded thousands
of dinosaur skeletons
and one layer of sediment
bears the reddish signature
of a dinosaur killer
so we can see here this
salmon-colored rock here
this line marks the end of
the age of the dinosaurs
and the beginning of the age of mammals
for geologists and paleontologists
this line here represents a
record of a catastrophic event
a meteorite impact
that occurred 66 million years ago
at the base of the layer
we have the last pollens
of the last plants that grew
at the end of the cretaceous
followed by iridium
which is an element extremely rare
at the surface of the earth
but extremely abundant in meteorites
this line here marks the
extinction of the dinosaurs
and still at the end of the 20th century
not all researchers accepted the theory
of an extraterrestrial impact
it wouldve left a massive
scar somewhere on earth
so where was the crater
scientists began looking for it
analyzing and dating each
major crater they could find
but none coincided with the
extinction of the dinosaurs
in the end it was two
geologists from an oil company
who discovered it by chance
nestled in mexico yucatan peninsula
half hidden by the waters off the coast
lay a crater more than 00 miles across
it was 66 million years old
and the horrors of the
most famous extinction
of all could no longer be denied
so if you were on planet
earth 6602 million years ago
walking around in a beautiful forest
triceratops is grazing next to you
you were worried you might
run into a tyrannosaurus rex
but you dont see one right now
life is good trees are flowering
suddenly in an instant a blinding light
and youre dead
the asteroid impact was an amazing thing
because unlike all the other extinctions
that preceded it
this one was global and instant
it took a second or two for the asteroid
to pass through the
atmosphere on the way in
the asteroid of course is gone
it vaporized
it now molten rock
shattered target rock
all that stuff blows back out
through the hole in the
atmosphere into low-earth orbit
the earth rotates underneath it
and then all that debris
starts to rain back
into the atmosphere
as it rains back in it heats
up and the sky gets hot
the heat from the sky makes it
to the ground and starts fires
so no matter where you are on earth
within hours
you are feeling some serious hurt
if youre anywhere in north
america forget about it
the initial explosion takes care of you
there smoke
there dust
blocks out the sunlight
if youre a plant
there no photosynthesis
if you were a big animal
if you survive the initial
blast somewhere on earth
there probably nothing to eat
you probably dont make it
through the first winter
a magnitude 3 earthquake
a gigantic tsunami
the raining blocks of rock
that are flown for hundreds of miles
and the oceans have taken
a great insult as well
the chemistry of the oceans have changed
the phytoplankton were
turned off for months
the zooplankton have then crashed
the marine food system is down
in total 3/4 of species vanished forever
all the big dinosaurs
were wiped off the map
but while the titans
died the stage was set
for some tiny survivors
to take over the world
the royal tyrrell museum is home to one
of the world largest
dinosaur collections
including a specimen of
the most terrifying of all
tyrannosaurus rex
but here scientists are also resurrecting
the little animals that
would inherit the earth
craig scott
head of conservation and research
studies the mammals of the paleocene
the time just after the fifth extinction
im essentially a paleo-dentist
because the vast majority
of specimens that i examine are teeth
the fossil record of mammals
is largely a dental record
you do get the occasional jaws
and sometimes you get some
postcranial remains as well
but for mammals of this age and older
the record is primarily dental
well from looking at these teeth
i can tell from the shapes of the cusps
that this animal was probably
eating some resistant foods
maybe really hard insects
or it might have even
been crushing mollusks
so the shells of snails and clams
and i can also tell by looking at the teeth
that they have a very good resemblance
to living relatives of
hedgehogs and shrews
those mammals
that survived the fifth mass
extinction were no larger
than a rat but the fossils
that craig scott is analyzing
illustrates the speed
with which they evolved diversified
and became giants
exploiting the ecological niches
once monopolized by the dinosaurs
so this is the skull of an
animal called a pantodont
and pantodonts were large
almost hippopotamus-like herbivores
that lived during the
paleocene and the eocene
they represent the group of mammals
that achieved the largest body
size during the paleocene
and some of these animals made it up
to the size of a very large cow
so within 5 million
years or 20 million years
after the extinction event
mammals went from animals
that had an average body size
of maybe a small rabbit up
to something that similar
to living hippopotamuses
so that quite a leap
and a mere 0 million
or so years after that
mammals got even larger
and they achieved body sizes equivalent
to living elephants and rhinoceroses
the great extinction
events were revolutions
in the story of life because the thread
of life never completely
snapped and five times
cataclysms opened up new
worlds to the survivors
after each new branches on
the tree of life would bloom
and fill the void left by the dead
and across the earth
that little shrew-like animal
multiplied transformed
and became all the fantastic
mammals we know today
some even returned to the seas
they evolved into unique forms and adapted
to every climate every environment
side-by-side with other survivors
they created a world
as colorful and diverse
as any that had gone before
this is the sixth earthly
paradise and it is uniquely ours
because one among this mammalian multitude
a species of primate rose up
on its hind legs to dominate
and remake the earth like
no other species before it
some lineages were important in times past
and disappeared
because they didnt survive extinctions
but what we have today
is this composite world
humans and trees and whales
and fish and birds and primates
you can go back
in their individual lineages
and find out when their lucky moment was
when did their ancestors
survive key extinctions
when was their point
when their ancestors
radiated and diversified
and were all survivors
at this point in time
human beings now study the forces
of nature that propelled them to dominance
a restless earth with a
volatile and vulnerable climate
an equilibrium we know
to be alarmingly fragile
supporting a complex web of life
all on a home where death could come
from the skies in an instant
but the next mass extinction
may already be upon us
and for the first time
it may be more akin to mass suicide
previous crises have
all had a natural cause
they were either caused
by volcanic eruptions
meteorite impacts or a climate change
the difference with this crisis is
it 00% caused by humans
as such it happening
at a much faster rate
and it far less predictable
right around every extinction weve seen
one or a couple of species
surges in dominance
and that what were seeing today
with humanity taking off at the expense
of other animals on the planet
the timescale that were talking about now
for the current crisis is
incredibly incredibly fast
much much faster than anything
that weve experienced before
mankind is destroying its own planet
at a phenomenal rate
even at our human scale
we can see species becoming extinct
whatever happens
life will regenerate on earth
and itll only take a few million years
but what the actors
will be in that new play
that plays out over the
future of life on this planet
it anyone guess
on the unimaginable timescale
of our planet evolution
we now know that history repeats itself
and the lesson of that history is clear
when catastrophe strikes
molten frozen or hell from the heavens
the creatures that dominate
will likely vanish
but the earth itself will not
and life will always find a way

and the last i spoke
with professor phelps
he agrees
that no one here
will censor
your decision to go
dr zalazny

chandra
chandra
chandra
it me
who are you
i am your father
chandra
i dont have
a father
how can you
be my father
i made this program
so we could meet
when you would be
old enough to understand
but i dont
understand
you were born in the times
of the mad minds
it ended with my death
youre the last omega
chandra
omega
we were taken out
of the cities
and implanted
it was meant to turn us
into teachers
shamans
we were called a lot of things
and then we were brought
back to the cities
to become leaders
what cities
theyre all gone
you were implanted
at birth
and it was my hope
that one day you would
become our leader
who
who are the people
that brought me here
they are the protectors
they have been raised to
sacrifice their lives for you
well if youre
my father
who my mother
you are an omega now
it will take some time
but soon you will feel
the powers that lay dormant
tell me
about my mother
il est ne

chantons tous
son avenement
i believe doctor
you were to limit
your studies
to the medical
aspects of
prototype
youve known all along
what did you think
happened
to the medical
program
you think they
passed out of existence
like dinosaurs
unsuccessful implants
failure of
the omega interface
it all bullshit
isnt it taurence
bullshit
the program was
a failure doctor
ridiculous
the omegas did
successfully adapt
to their implants
their failure was in
the overriding
of the primary
programming directives
so the government
created prototype
to assassinate
the omegas
assassination
doctor
prototypes werent
designed as assassins
they were the next
step in cybernetics
total rebirth
00% cybernetically
integrated entities
it was
an assassination program
it was the logical
conclusion
to an experiment
that had gone
out of control
doctor
that was
over 20 years ago
yes doctor
a different time
a time youre not
familiar with
or able to judge
maybe youre right
taurence
but why would
the government
let me come here and re-create
another prototype
you came here
for medical
research doctor
your unsealing of
the prototype lab
will assist us
in the conclusion
of the program
it was intended to
the conclusion
of what program
what are you
talking about
omega doctor
there is one left
one that was
implanted at birth
one that i believe
remains inactivated
until now
you see doctor
we couldnt allow
the same mistake
to plague us again
am i going to get
out of here alive taurence
arent you being
a bit overly dramatic
dr zalazny
it like the stories
of the people
that hunted down the
nazis in the second
world war
history to most
except the hunters
dr t roberts
dr taurence roberts
it you isnt it
yes doctor
where are you going
home
where else
would i be going
my work
is completed here
good night doctor
uh yeah
good night
what are you
doing here
i said
what are you doing
what does it
look like im doing
it looks like
youre leaving
well are you
yes im leaving
did i do something
no
i have to go away with
some people for a while
why why
look
i cant stay here
all right
we cant pretend
were brother
and sister anymore
you understand
dont follow me
stupid bitch
the a0
or the a002 programs
will not operate
without the omega
shell program
can i leave
the suit
and return
to what i was
no
you will die
to live
i must eliminate
the omega signal
yes
why was i created
you were reborn
to carry out
the omega program hawkins
i am no longer
the same hawkins
it will take time
you will acclimate
to your environment
in the suit
one day you may be able
to live outside of it
it will not be
the same hawkins
that leaves
the suit
if i die will you
build another
yes
i will build another
30 years ago
the government
ended the program
and sealed the lab
dr zalazny research
has allowed me
to complete my work
yes
i understand
i
i am alone
we are all alone hawkins
no
no
no
aah
aah
you need me hawkins
no
back cracks
metal cracking
dont kill him
chandra

the mind is its own place and in itself
can make a heaven of hell
a hell of heaven
john milton paradise lost
the great poet goethe
said at the end of his life
that he couldnt see one single mistake
among his fellow human beings
that he hadnt himself committed
if goethe saw his fellow
humans like this
how do you think then that the
son of man looks upon us
jesus message
is one of forgiveness
so my dear friends
there is no hell
now you want to sing right
we will now it happeneds that there are
two psalm numbers on the board
so which should we take
well actually do both at once
because it so that
in the psalm book from 937
well be singing psalm number 2
ive written 297 to prevent confusion in case it
should so be that any of you has the edition from 986
but both my dad and me
we might snort a bit about
these kinds of modern things
but now you know psalm 2
wonderful is the earth
if it is so that one imagines
certain things elsie
it is possible to receive medical help
one can talk to a doctor
one can get medicial help
nothing helps
i see things
when is the last time that you saw a spirit
i see one right now
now in here
yes
to the left behind you
i cant see anything
can you see who this spirit is
yes
it your mother
really i see
and what does little mom want
she is sad
extremely sad
about whom
about you
i think that we do so that you go home
and take a calming bath
and then you open the good book
and read something from the book of psalms
and which psalm should i read
it doesnt matter theyre all hits
hello
hi karolina
has he eaten sausage and macaroni
and a little chocolate ice cream
and a little seems there always
room for that just like last time
it gone very well
and the meeting with elsie
yes it
it went well
yes i think so it went well
im meeting her tomorrow
did you sleep last night
yes
did you dream again
about your mother in the kitchen
you have been dreaming the same dream
for two weeks please itll work out
is he in his room
he going to be really happy about that
how are you is everything going well
it looks like it going well
so i wont disturb
it just that it feels
a little lumpy here in the sofa
do you think i think there possibly
a present lying here
a small present
to jesper from daddy
it not
it no
just a small thing
hi
hi mommy
were going to have fun tomorrow
hi
hi
ill take it
are you going to tell your daddy goodbye

he a little occupied
can i tell him anything
super super
i understand
come on
goodbye
goodbye
goodbye son
have a good time then
ill tell him
bye
it just a phase
who was it it was the expert on
forensic medicine in hammerdal
the expert on forensic medicine
in hammerdal what did he want
henrik
your dad is dead
im sorry
what
okay how
and how did he die
he drowned
i see
right
did he say anything else
but he must have said something
didnt he leave a number
dont you think that it odd that it is
the expert on forensic medicine calling
it the police that should be
delivering such messages
is it the expert on forensic medicine
that calls around saying such
maybe there so few people
working with such up there
there are few working with such and you know this
no i dont but i could imagine
yes you can imagine but you dont know and i dont
know either none of us knows i just find it odd
i think it really odd
extremely odd
i need to go up there and solve this
now you want to go now
im planning on leaving now yes
you cant go tonight
and why cant i drive now
because it almost dark and youre upset
it dangerous for you to go
okay
i have to go
yes of course
you
goodbye very well
tell me if there something i can do
yes no worries
i can sleep over if you want me to
no thank you that not necessary
henrik

we should call the expert on forensic medicine
det practical part first when the house

yes
hello
hi my name is henrik
go away
are you related to gabriel horneus
gabriel boy in stockholm
with old grandmother
i havent heard anything
he lived up there until the end
and grandfather
alvar
he killed himself
in the broken tree by the road
your father cut him down
one didnt talk about such
but my the boy could preach
you can be proud
he frightened the entire village to
healthy fear of god
he described the last judgement
what happends with those that betray god
what sort of pay that awaits
if we cant hold our fingers in
boiling water for a second did he say
how would it then feel like to be
in a boiling pot for the rest of eternity
it worked
but the tempter hated it hated
and that was why he sent
a messenger he sendt her
yes even your father
was a man in the flesh
it was disgraceful woman
a dirty dirty little whore
and he fell over and over again
i asked him to fight
and christ was victorious
but in the end
from the dirty stump spread the bad
and the bad got the upper hand
and it screamed in him
it screamed
the last day he walked around here
as a foaming stallion
that was the last that i saw of my boy
when he went over to the whore for the last time
i think dad was murdered
i think it was the father
of the lidman family
no no
the father of the lidman family is an
irreproachable man there a child there
it no good child
so you must have felt
it a damaged horrible evil child
a child that killed your father
no
henrik
henrik
come henrik
come
mommy will show you
mommy will show you everything
what were you doing in the barn
nothing
what were you doing in the barn
i did nothing please olle
you have to believe me
my father lvar
i hate that man
hate
but our carnal fathers are nothing
our spiritual father is everything
our god is coming god anger
burst forwards like a storm
but the roman letter paul says we
should fight the evil with the good
nahum from alqosh the lord is
a vengeful god full of suffering
the lord revenges his opponents
psalm 37 happy is the one who repays you
according to what you have done to us
happy is the one who seizes your infants
and dashes them against the rocks
the mercy of the lord infinite
his compassion never ends
psalm 58
to forgive is the central part
isaiah  verse 25
i will avenge me of mine enemies
and they shall both burn together
in a fire that will never end
glowing coal and sulphur
burning winds is the weight theyll get
jesaja 66 vers 6 with fire and with his sword
the lord will execute judgment on all people
and they will go out and look on the dead
bodies of those who rebelled against me
the worms that eat them will not die
the fire that burns them will not be quenched
the swedish church has since 983
refused the existence of a hell
theyre cowardly
theyre cowards and infidels
the disgracful murderers
their place is in the sea
burning of sulfur and fire
they shall be tormented day and night for ever
and ever book of revelation chapter 20
can you feel it
the bronze gates has opened
all the way down to the ninth circle
open your eyes and see
take the sword that god
has put before you
psalm 2
psalm 2
thy hand shall be equal to
all thine enemies
thy right hand shall overtake
those that hate thee
thou shalt make them as a fiery furnace
in the time of thine anger
the lord shall swallow them up in his wrath
and the fire shall devour them
their fruit shalt thou destroy
from the earth
and their seed from
among the children of men
for they intended evil against thee
they imagined a device
wherewith they shall not prevail
for thou shalt make them turn their back
thou shalt make ready with thy
bowstrings against the face of them
be thou exalted o lord in thy strength
so will we sing and praise thy power
thy hand shall be equal to
all thine enemies
thy right hand shall overtake
those that hate thee
thou shalt make them as a fiery furnace
in the time of thine anger
the lord shall swallow them up in his wrath
and the fire shall devour them
their fruit shalt thou destroy
from the earth
and their seed from
among the children of men
for they intended evil against thee
they imagined a device
wherewith they shall not prevail
for thou shalt make them turn their back
thou shalt make ready with thy
bowstrings against the face of them
be thou exalted o lord in thy strength
so will we sing and praise thy power
thy hand shall be equal to
all thine enemies
thy right hand shall overtake
those that hate thee
thou shalt make them as a fiery furnace
henrik why did you do it

like they took your father
dont you see the expert of forensic
medicine is on his hunting team

of forensic medicine covered it
run
olle
now it time to reap
what some has sowed
tonight when the lamp in the barn
is lighted again he coming now
in fire
with the lord flaming sword
help me help me
are you so weak are you so weak
that youre letting him laugh scornfully
are you so weak that you let him murder
your father and then laugh scornfully
no no ill report him
report him what do you think
that will matter
if justice is to win youll have to
take fate into your own hands
it time to do what you came for
it time to revenge your father
ill show you the way
ill give you the tool
im so tired
rest
when you awake you shall arise
in new shape
yes well then
nora
olle where have you been
but sit down
who lit the light in the barn
who lit the light in the barn
olle who lit the light in the barn
first i will read
a psalm to you
a psalm that his father read
at every church service
youll probably remember it
it a psalm expressing the core
of the faith it about the enemies of god
it about you
it psalm 2
the priest shall well call larserik
it too late
the priest has asked you about calling lars-erik
for three days but you have declined
because you know that he lying you know
if one takes the life of a god servant
one has commited a deadly sin
you know you know and you will get your
punishment now and in all eternity
olle
psalm 2 goes like this
thy hand shall be equal to
all thine enemies it was you
thou shalt make them as a fiery furnace
it was you that lit the light in the barn every night
make them as a fiery furnace
in the time of thine anger
there something you need to know
there something you dont know
the lord shall swallow them up in his wrath
and the fire shall devour them
there something you need to know
the fire shall devour them
their fruit shalt thou destroy
from the earth and their seed
tell
for they intended evil against thee
tell youve misunderstood everything
silence
tell him with thy bowstrings
against the face of them
amen
amen hit amen hit hit hit
he did horrible things
one arent allowed to do so
one arent allowed to do so
him and me in the barn
when we were reading
the lord shall swallow them up in his wrath
and the fire shall devour them
their fruit shalt thou
destroy from the earth
and their seed from among
the children of men
so will we sing and praise thy power
thy hand shall be equal to
all thine enemies
thou shalt make them as a fiery furnace
in the time of thine anger
the lord shall swallow them up
in his wrath
amen
and it continued after the wedding
it continued after the wedding
it was a disgraceful woman
a shame
a dirty dirty little whore
she lying she lying lies
hit hit hit
oh olle
gabriel is your father
it strange
it strange but i always felt
that was the way it should be
and it makes it so much easier
it was my fault
there is a child there it not
good child so you must have felt
a damaged horrible evil child
it was me that did it
a child that killed your father
it was my fault
you and dad was in the forest
mom was cutting my hair
then
then came
he talked to mom
they talked well
then
horneus he
his hand
his hand
and momshe saw
mom talked
and mom pointed
he bent over
and mom
mom
mom
drowning
olle
lvar
olle
i didnt say anything
dad
i didnt say anything
but you told henrik
you told
no i didnt
one isnt allowed to tell henrik
and you knew
it was our little secret
our little little secret
that mom wasnt supposed to know
it was between the two of us
between the two of us
but i didnt say nothing
henrik she did know
confess now henrik
it better that way
henrik do you know what happends
when one tells no
henrik ive told you
many times
what happends when one tells
is that one has to be punished
punished hard
for a very long time
very long time
forgive me
dadforgive me
it too late
henrik it doesnt help
that youve been standing there preaching
pretending that the punishment
is just an idea
you cannot lie away the sword
of truth the lies will get you
you cant joke away the day of judgement
when god shows you
his face of anger
will you understand how
gruesome a god he is
i cannot believe in a god that is
less merciful than myself
youre just making it worse for yourself
you have to be thrown down now
down into the dark abyss
from which noone returns
down into the lake that burns
of fire and sulfur
downinto hell
oh god oh god
he cant help you now
it a completely different power
that you will meet
you will meet yourself
my boy
my pretty pretty boy
it here
we found you on the floor
in the kitchen last night
dad carried you up
how are you
yes lars-erik niskala
expert on forensic medicine in hammerdal
the priest will meet at the assembly
yes
ajna want to say something
it leads your way through life
he said
we used to sit here and read
your father would have wanted that
someone believing in it should have it
yes after all it does say
some good things as well
the topic of today sermon
is possibly a little
unorthodox maybe
the last week has been
the last week has been
a bit odd for me
but i sleep a lot better now
i sleep better than ive done
in a long time
i dream different dreams
good dreams
i dream about a world without shame
and without blame
do not judge
so you will not yourself become judged
a carpenter son from nazareth
once said this
but what does the religions do
what does the churches do
the way i see it religions exist
for one reason only
in order to repress the people
to scare the serving classes
into obedience
so they will not dare to challenge
the privileges of the elite
and the elite
ladies and gentlemen are you
you never had sin and shamed
beaten into you
the elite that has always been sitting
in this church not in some country church
has never needed
to listen to sermons about hell
what is he saying
at the end of the 800s when one
wanted dedemonise the church
arch bishop sundberg said yes
but a peasant hell
will always be needed
a peasant hell
will always be needed
is he joking the one with the power
defines what moral
in the name of the holy lord
but noone noone has monopoly on god
i told you last week i dont know if you remember
but i said that there is no hell but i was wrong
i was wrong there is a hell
i know now
oh yes there is a hell
in the religions
there was no hell until religions
the religions invented hell
now hell have to pull himself together
do not judge
so you will not yourself be judged
so said the son of man
and still this is what the church has been
doing for 700 years
700 years
what is he saying
of torture
execution crusades
blood fire violence and abuse
john wrote in the first epistle to the corinthians
the one that does not love remains in death
this is the law
this is the answer
now hell pull himself together
no silence server the power
the only way in which to defend oneself from
the silence is to tell the truth
the truth will set you free
the truth and love
the endless unconditional love
this is the only god
that i have left
down
down
certain people dont agree with me but i think
it is a good god it a god that i would want to be
out
out out of the house of god
praise the lord in heaven
praise him in height
praise him all of his angels
praise him all of his army
praise him sun and moon
praise him all shining stars
praise him you heaven of heaven
you water over the sky
they shall praise his name
for he commanded their creation
he gave them their place in eternity
decided an orden that will never perish
yours is the day
yours is the night
god river is full of water
you take care of the earth give it rain
make it fertile and rich
you make the seeds grow
water the fields
where you pass forth
grows fat crops
the grazes of the wasteland goes fertile
the heights dress in rejoicing
the fields are adorned with flocks of sheep
the valleys are covered with seeds
everything is rejoice and song
everything is rejoice and song

just be better off
with like a dating app
or something
these are professionals
they hang on your arm
they say all the right things
and then you say goodbye
it the perfect solution
you get the benefit of a date
without all the baggage
you cant keep avoiding
your coworkers
theyre gonna start
to take it personally
so youre really gonna go
right

from life

this guy must have
really made an impression
it not a date
then why are you wearing
your favorite perfume
because

i thought the whole point
of hiring somebody
was to avoid
romantic entanglements
it was
you seem entangled

that were already involved
plus my boss has made it clear
that he expects
to see him there tonight

to know others is wisdom
to know oneself
is enlightenment
i think were gonna
go to the bar
it was nice meeting you
how do you do it

keep track of all the lies
i prefer to think of them
as characters
do women ask you to be
a lot of different things
usually doctors lawyers
and if they wanna tick off
mom and dad at thanksgiving
im in a band
do you ever lose yourself
in all of this
sometimes

-you know
i dont reveal my sources

okay
i overheard garrett
talking to betty
garrett
what did he say
he said you crushed it
god i hope so
let me tell you
if i got this promotion
it would change everything
you know jake and i
are just getting by right now
it would mean more money
more flexibility
youre a shoe-in
you think so
no one works as hard as you
and your boyfriend
seemed to be a hit
garrett would not shut up
about his golfing prowess
you know
he not really my boyfriend
what too soon for labels
no i mean were not together
well have you ever heard
of this place called
the companionship collective
ew the rent-a-date place

that were together
and i just dont wanna
correct anyone
please dont
dont say anything
no my lips are sealed

well in hand

to the executive director

so ive been hoping to have
a little chat you and i
have you given much thought
to your future
my future
here at the company
did you talk to kyle
no
i thought
i would speak to you first
ive been giving this
a lot of thought
and i think you would be
an ideal candidate for partner
partner
i have been very impressed
with your work around here
youve become invaluable
in a very short time
and i think
that youve earned it
thank you very much
i-i dont even know what to say
well thank you is a good start
thank you again
all right
now get out of here
and do some work
yes
miles hi
hey
just calling to check in
you were just pretty upset
yesterday when you left
i-is everything okay
yes thank you
i-i appreciate that
actually i got the promotion
i guess
kyle didnt say anything
that great diane
we should celebrate
um you know a-actually
i dont think
that a good idea
i think we owe it to ourselves
to see where this could go
right
take a chance with me diane
tsk okay when
you get lunch at 200 right
meet me at the park
front entrance
-ill see you there
hey
gotta make this quick buddy
i have a date
was that miles
yeah it was
i was talking with betty
her son a grade above jake
she said miles isnt a part
of the big brother program
i dont understand
he not being honest with you
im sure
there an innocent explanation
ill ask him when i see him
i know it not my place
to say anything
but i think you should stay away
from this guy
youre right
it isnt your place
so im just a little confused
betty told me that you arent
part of the big brother program
at school
she said that there no miles
i have to tell you something
and it
i dont know how youre gonna
take this but
the agency insists
we use false names
false names
so youre not a miles
or a benjamin
no
that why betty was confused
because she didnt know
your real name
im sorry for the deception
the but the agency
just has really strict policies
on what we share with clients
clients
i thought
we were becoming friends i
are you still
just playing a part with me
no not anymore
i-im sorry i-i dont know
what i was thinking
no i should have i should have
told you on our second date
that-that when i knew there
was something real between us
im peter peter dwyer
you see it my real name
please stay
what are you looking for
ideally a fourth for golf
gotcha
i guess
that when it comes to dating
im a little out of practice
well you went through
a traumatic event
it takes time
it must have been very hard
it was
it still is i
you know i dont even sleep in
the same bedroom since he died
i sleep in the guest bedroom
i havent told anyone that
im glad you trust me
my wife
she had been working late
all week
it was a big project
she loved her job
she should have called me
but she didnt
and she wrapped her car
around a tree going 50
she died instantly
i know that we got off
to a rocky start
but i want you to know that
ive been more real with you
than anyone since my wife died
and ive been wanting to share
myself with you for a while now
thank you for hearing me
i like being with you
you make me happy
and i just havent had that
for a long time
russell what
he not who you think he is
who
your companion
it all been one big lie
his name isnt even miles
when i tried to hire him
they told me his name was greg
when you tried to hire him
i was worried about you
that gives you no right
to insert yourself like this
and his name isnt even greg
or miles
it peter dwyer actually
he told you
yes
it agency policy
to use fake names
okay but he let you think
he was a completely different
person for weeks
and youre just okay with that
well at first of course not
but now that he told me
the truth
if he lying about his name
what else is he lying about
hey mom

darling you need
to speak more clearly
chuckles you are so--
do you learn it at school
enunciation
clearly no
sorry
olly scoffs
no okay
sighs i love it here
both chuckle
oliver delaney
yes
woman you can go through
if you can see here your
right hip is severely damaged
it really a miracle
you can walk at all
im not sure how you manage it
but if you keep walking this
same way
it will deteriorate to the
point where youll need
a hip replacement
how long before that
needs to happen
depends how he walks his
bones are already compromised
because of the osteoporosis
maybe 0 years
i would recommend getting
him into surgery now though
to release and lengthen
some of the ligaments
to help improve his walk
ah chuckles if you wanna
get him into surgery now
why not do the hip
replacement now
no point in replacing tires
if theyre not worn out yet
how do you know
if theyre worn out
uh you wont be
able to walk anymore
you wont be able to put
weight on your right leg
plus youd feel it
the pain i mean
and youre saying
this ligament operation
will prevent that
doctor yes hopefully
how long will he
be in hospital for
doctor two to three weeks
but then in a wheelchair
for about three
months after that
depending on how
quick he recovers
well he usually recovers
pretty quickly so
dont you
mm-hmm
how do you feel
im fine can we just go
sorry about that darling

did you fuck up my hip

who will i be when
the night comes forward
and who will i be when

woman vocalizing
and so i sang to man
with no voice today
and he took it
in with a smile
but not much did he say
and then i spoke to a lady
and she had
pearls in her ears
and we talked
about the world
and then we talked about
feelings
so i gave in to a child
though ive always
been within
collected tickets
from my pockets
for what i dont
music drowns out voice
and i think
women vocalizing
time to be
melodic electronic music

this hot chick named nina
started partying way too much
her grades were slipping
so her parents grounded her
now if her grades improved
they have her a second chance
but with an early curfew
now as you can guess
on her first night out
nina was having such a good time
that she didnt make
it back on time
and when she finally
did get home
she found all the lights out
she tried the front door
wasnt locked
so instead of just
going on inside
she went around back and
climbed the old oak tree
beneath her bedroom window
as she had done so
many times before
next morning nina
wakes up early
it was quiet
so she thought maybe
her folks went into town
without waking her
when she reaches the
bottom of the stairs
she sees blood everywhere
she runs in the living room
to find her parents
mangled bodies
she screams when she
sees written on the walls
in their blood the words
lucky you didnt
open the door
asshole you trying to
give me a heart attack
look im sorry i
heard this story before

hey

hey you

well
michele i think
that clears it up
the hunter corroborated
your story however
we have yet to confirm the
perpetrator identity
detective it sophia
abigail possessed her
why cant you believe me
calm down calm down
you need to get some
rest all right
ill have a transcript
made of this recording
and well go from
there all right
i promise
did you guys find jessica
we did
is she
im afraid so
michele
time for your meds
good afternoon
detective henderson
judy
are you done
actually were done
take care michele ill be
in touch soon all right
well talk
detective youre
not gonna find sophia
not unless she wants you to
ill be in touch
detective henderson
howard how are you
fascinating person
this abigail barker
she was a real person then
oh yeah absolutely
she was born in 670
what else can you tell me
well
this abigail barker was
put on trial in 692
and she was found
guilty of practicing
acts of witchcraft by
the local magistrate
she was then tortured
which was standard
practice at the time
and then eventually executed
really
okay wait a minute
how easy would it
be for my witness
to have access to
that information
well anyone can research it
but i suppose why
would be my question
and then
how would they even find
this book in the first place
which by the way
happens to be a compellation
of spells and incantations
to tell you the truth i as
hoping you were gonna tell me
that abigail barker was
just a bunch of folklore
and that book a
bunch of nonsense
now i can get back to work
and get that book carbonated
what else do you got for me
well i dont know
if it relevant at all
but i also found
some documentation
of accusations against
witches using amulets
to transform
themselves into animals
and even powerful
creatures supposedly
youve gotta be kidding me
no it was actually
documented multiple times
during the witch trials
well that about
all i have for now
but keep me posted on
what happens okay
most
definitely thank you
all right
goodbye
howard
who is that
you know who this is
no i dont know you
oh but you do
it abigail
no
that not possible
arent you a believer
take a seat professor
i said sit down
i dont understand
youre no different
than they were
it seems the professor has
been telling tall tales
to detective henderson
people love tall tales
wouldnt you say
i suppose
when i was younger
i used art and spells
to connect with nature
i only meant good back then
the folks people lied
and labeled me a witch
they did unspeakable
things to me
and i now you know the rest
but they couldnt destroy me
because i choose darkness
my ally
we have just been
waiting to find someone
to give me my vessel
the book of spells
ah youre a smart
man professor
so im sure you understand
that until i find my book
i only need a little blood
sacrifice here and there
professor let see what
dead flesh feels like
sleepy time
so dr flanagan said that i
could go home in a day or two
dont you think
it a bit too soon
why do you say that grandma
youre still having episodes
the neighbors
are talking huh
you know i dont
care about that
so then why do you have a
problem with me coming home
i dont
how travis mom doing
well
as well as can be
expected you know
they all blame me huh
honey until this thing
gets all sorted out
people are gonna talk
theyre gonna come to
their own conclusions
yeah well im a victim
in this too grandma
i know you are sweetheart
you know
sophia parents have put up
a reward for her safe return
she not coming home
she dead
i mean how many times
do i have to keep
telling people this
sophia is not sophia anymore
sophia killed travis she killed
all of my friends grandma
oh honey
that why i dont
want you to be
in such a hurry to come home
grandma i dont wanna stay
in this fucking
hospital anymore
it like a fucking
prison in here
i miss all of my
friends funerals
lieutenant
what up
hey nikki
detective
looks like miles had a chance
to call 9 before he died
so approximate time
of death 90 pm
he got a single knife
wound to the chest
was also stabbed in the hands
there some claw marks
in the back of his neck
god
how did they get in
no sign of a break-in
we had to pick the front
lock to gain access
locked from the inside
what this
he wrote a name
with his blood
dont touch anything
forensics is on the way
okay that odd because miles
was doing some research for
me on an abigail barker
so we have a suspect
not exactly the abigail
barker were talking about
died in 692
i guess that was too easy
hey what about that 9 call
he only asked
for an ambulance
the line went solid after that
okay im gonna wanna
get a copy of that call
ill get you a copy
and put it in the folder
hey how that
chadwick case coming
slowly were dealing
with a very fragile victim
victim
thought she was a suspect
another girl went missing
and right now she
the only survivor
well
physically youre
in excellent shape
any pain
nope
how about the nightmares
oh yeah those havent
come around in awhile
ready to go home
sure
well im gonna change
your medication a little bit
and if you have another
day without any incidents
you can go home
sounds good to me
lower her dosage
to 25 milligrams
and let keep an eye on her
what about her
nighttime pills
just give me a
call in the afternoon
and well make a decision then
dr flanagan am i gonna
have to take these pills
once i go home
well with this medication
you cant quit cold turkey
we have to decreased
your dosage gradually
i want you to contact
your family physician
in the next two days
well send you home
with some instructions
and my notes to your doctor
okay because im ready to go
yeah i bet you are
what do you got for me
i got nothing
ive dusted head to
toe several times
i cant even find
a partial print
what about these
claw marks here
any idea where they
would have come from
they appear to
have been made by talons
however that not
what killed him
he died from a single
knife wound to the chest
what about under
the fingernails
clean
whatever it was the poor
guy didnt have a chance
hey there
hi beth im
ready to go home now

it totally legal
still super gross though
i guess she is nineteen
she can pretty much
date whoever she pleases
i mean id
let her have this one
she got enough drama with

of your manicured reality
how well do you know your
friends and neighbors outside of
the safe bubble of
your online persona
welcome to red letter day
your instructions
are as follows
kill this person
before they kill you
the person in this photo has
been selected using data
from your online activity
you have been matched with
someone with conflicting beliefs
within five kilometers
of your residence
they too have been
sent this same letter
with your image and address
happy hunting and good luck
then there is an address
below alice photo
mine says the exact same thing
except for it just a picture
of some random bald dude
maddie what does yours say
im not opening that
knowing my luck

chill out maddie
it just some dumb prank
chill out
we received letters
telling us to kill people

a letter
yeah this letter tells me
to kill one of my neighbors
before they kill me
it says that they
received the same letter
have you tried discussing
this with your neighbor
no
i literally just received
this and thought that i should
notify you first in case any
other letters had been reported
it likely just a prank
do you have children

to be patronized right now
what would you like us to do
your job maybe

i am cooperating just please

another boring morning
in aspen ridge doesnt it
yeah

that totally him
oh good it looks like
he leaving for the day
one less thing to worry about
does he have a
letter in his mailbox
cant tell
it one of those
old school ones on a post
you know this is
actually kind of fun
aside from the creepy
letters and everything
what sporty kevin
smith is up to over here

let me see
christ
you know now would
probably be a good time to
give alice a call
yeah
mel
hey ali
hang on a sec

one of those stupid letters too
yeah pretty messed up hey
oh god
looks like im dealing with
a bit of a poo-naumi over here
you have my sympathy
lewis a little help over here

just swinging by
for a cup of tea or something

ok chat soon
you made a big mess
you made a big mess
yes you did
mom please
you dont need to do this
she just a few houses down
ill be ten minutes
fifteen tops
but what if-
maddie come on
this is alice
were talking about here
at least take this
for protection
tim put that back right now
i think we should just call dad
ok come on look
whoever sent these letters
is trying to get us
to behave irrationally
for their own sick
pleasure or whatever
i think we should just call dad
he would know what to do
i can assure
you that your father
would not keep his cool
in this situation
he would likely just
barricade all the windows
maybe that not
such a bad idea
it better than
what youve got
look just stay here
ill be back soon
we good
i love you
i love you too tim
but let not act like it
the end of the world ok
take care maddie
oh and lock the
door behind me ok
hey youre probably still in
the air but i just wanted to
let you know there some
really weird shit going on
im sure once you land
youll hear all about it
but we just didnt
want you to worry
were safe for now even if
mom did leave us home alone
call back when you get this
i think youre being a
little too hard on mom
she trying her best
whatever
what kind of parent
leaves her children alone
during a time like this
give me a break maddie
i mean she literally
ten houses down in aspen ridge
maybe the lamest
neighborhood in the city
you might be taking these
letters a little too seriously
i dont think youre
taking them seriously enough
damn
people are sure
going nuts over this
holy shit
daria just posted a video
of her dad fighting
really let see
you try to act
like youre innocent

here before i call the cops
isis dont mean shit to me
you try to scare me
isis dont mean shit
to me motherfucker

even talking about
i was born in this country
my parents were born
in this country
ill bet it was
you isis fucks that
even sent those letters huh
you wanna kill me
you wanna fucking kill me
come on take your best shot
youre a loser
youre not even worth my time
what the fuck did
you just say to me
what the fuck did you
jesus christ
what the fuck is
wrong with people
i knew this was the type
of shit that was hidden
underneath the surface
i just figured most
of it was in the us
rednecks like that are just
always looking for an excuse
people are shit
try not to get too
cynical maddie
i mean there
plenty of good people
were good people
whatever you say
i just hope daria is okay
looks like there a group
taking credit for the letters
the unknown
there a video
welcome to the
inaugural red letter day
presented by your
friends at the unknown
each of you has been
assigned one person to kill
before they kill you
what you do next is up to you
for too long have we been
categorized and separated
in the name of
profit and control
today we engage
will kindness and manners
prevail or will the true
self-serving nature of
humankind rear its ugly head
stay tuned and happy hunting
what the fuck was that
maybe we shouldnt have
let mom go to alice
play it again
it just mel
ya big scaredy cat
boo
come in come in
damn
somehow your house has
become even more beautiful
than the last time i saw it
oh mel youre sweet
i dont think that much
has changed
melanie
lewis
hello lucy
how my favorite
little lady doing
looks like someone
missed their auntie
green or black tea
green would be lovely
here let me get that for you
ok
has he been getting
enough sleep lately
im sorry he been
like this all morning
lewis
make yourself useful and
put a kettle on for us
i hear you made a
little mess this morning
the little stinker
how is it only
nine am and youve already
managed to roast a chicken
ive been up since
four with lucy
were trying to
cut out deli meat
i read about another listeria
outbreak on facebook
one more reason to
become vegetarian i guess
i would try lewis is more
of a red meat kind of guy
residents of the
calgary neighborhood of
crazy start to the day huh
yeah this is so messed up
has anyone you know
not yet as far as i know
they say to just to sit
tight until the police figure it out
if the dickhead i spoke
with this morning is on the case
i have no hope
of it being resolved
have a little compassion
imagine putting your
life on the line everyday
only to be treated
like an a-hole
didnt you date a cop once
ssshhhhh
thanks louie
uh huh
an anarchist group
calling themselves the unknown
are taking responsibility
god the news is so
depressing these days
mixed with all of
these dystopian tv shows
youd think the world is ending
were not evening getting
cable in the new place
pinching pennies are we
the kids dont
even watch it anymore
and id rather read a novel
or do something outside
to each their own
that the picture
these weirdos decided to use
you look good
thanks
so which picture
did they use for me
you were doing yoga
tim said you looked cute
well that flattering
crazy to think they
can just gather all our
information on the internet
it feels like such an
invasion of privacy
i know
it a strange new world
all your most intimate details
up to the highest bidder
it makes you want to
move to the mountains
id last about two week
yeah i guess we need to adapt
i mean can you even remember
what you used to in a line-up
or the waiting room or in the
bathroom before you had a phone
magazines
newspapers
archie
oh yeah
i guess it the same
thing just digital
and now you can voice
all your thoughts without
an opinions column
i try to stay away
from all that garbage
but sometimes you just
get sucked in
i just learned what
a cuck was last week
i dont even want to know
so who did lewis
get in his letter
i mean you dont have to
if it uncomfortable
mrs miller
i dont know if youve met her
yet but she is the cutest
goes around every
christmas with a tin of cookies
for everyone in the community
strange hed be paired
with such a sweet old woman
i know i mean i cant
believe their data or whatever
paired you and i together
i mean you do vote
conservative but
when are you going to stop
grilling me about that
last time i promise
so who did the kids get
if you dont mind
me asking of course
classic maddie
she just ripped hers up and
stormed off to her room
tim got this weird balding man
you might have seen
him walking his cat
that guy
oh he so weird
that cat barely moves
i swear i see him carrying it
more than i see it walking
so is maddie still
seeing that older boy
yeah but i cant blame her
i mean i went through a
bad boy phase myself
more than once
hell i married one
i shouldnt stay long
i just wanted to say that
im not taking
this letter seriously
like at all
i appreciate it
i was going to
call you right away
but i had to calm
lewis down first
you know how he gets
yeah
the kids are freaking out too
i tried telling them this was
likely just some dumb prank
here hoping
i should get back to the kids
so how are they adjusting to
the move and everything
tim is taking it
like a champ but maddie
i think she still
really misses kris
it hard enough being 9
just give it time
you got this
thanks ali
here hoping they
finish that new complex soon
it would be great to
have a cinema nearby
oh gees i cannot remember the
last time we went to a movie
not since lucie was born anyway
lewis what was the last
show we saw in the theatres
lewis
melanie can you please
explain why you brought
a large knife into my home
lucifer still hasnt responded
nope
i wouldnt worry about it
his coffin likely hasnt
let in the morning light yet
dick
oh fuck looks like theyre
reporting a murder in town
what
a custodian was attacked by
a masked man using a hatchet
at the bass pro shop at
crossiron mills this morning
police services suspect that
this is the first known murder
to occur in what is being
referred to as red letter day
police remind citizens to stay
inside and to keep all doors
locked until more
information is known
follow updates online using the
hashtag #yycredletterday for
more breaking news
as it happens
bass pro
chances are this murder isnt
even related to the letters
it wild
just wild
oh fuck
holy fuck holy fuck
who is that tim
oh my god
maddie i need you go upstairs
and call the police ok
go upstairs lock the bathroom
door and call the police

but it is simply not possible
please
hello
hello madison are you
still with me
madison
madison
please just come help us
alice please
i can explain
tim tried to give me that
knife before i left the house
just in case something
happened and he must have
slipped it into my
purse without me noticing
right and you just
didnt happen to notice
a gigantic carving
knife in your purse
well im so fucking sorry
lewis but as you may have
noticed there a lot of really
weird shit going on today
stop it
stop it you two
mel why would tim put the knife
in there if he knew you were
coming to my house
he just a dumb kid
im sure he thought he
was doing the right thing
im trying to believe you but
does tim think were bad people
do you think were bad people
that rich coming from
the edwards family
excuse me lewis
what is that supposed to mean
what do you think it means
lewis can we please just
discuss this upstairs
do you have something
against my family
oh where to start
you let your teenage
daughter date a grown man
you leave trash
all over your lawn
and youre enabling your
son to become an alcoholic
just like his father
and youre one to talk
dont think i dont know how
much you spend on webcam models
what was it last month alice
four thousand dollars
five hundred dollars for
just a pair of used panties
you told her about that
that was a secret melanie
i told you that in confidence
well i guess it all
out in the open now
and to think me and my
low-class family spent
christmas with you last year
how ashamed you must have been
what you must think of me
to believe for one second
that i was planning to
use that knife on you
look alice this is stupid
how long have we
known each other
ten years
do not touch her
all we know is that we received
a letter saying you would try to
kill alice and then
you show up at our home
with a ten inch blade
you will not lay another
hand on me lewis
you got that
then you will keep your
distance from my wife
this has been a crazy day
and clearly coming
here was a bad idea
so im just going to
get my things and go
youre not going anywhere
you are gonna stay right here
until the authorities arrive
alice are you really going
to let him behave this way
are you going to let
him treat me this way
look mel just do
what lewis says
alice stop her
she going for the knife
alice please
are you fucking
kidding me right now
my children are calling me
they need me tim needs me
i just want to answer my phone
im sorry
this is fucking crazy
lewis im sure we can work this
out just put down the knife
the only solution i can think of
is to lock you in the basement
until the police arrive
my children need me
that doesnt
concern me melanie
what matters to me is
the safety of my family
shhhh
it ok
so the choice is yours
you go down by
your own free will
or by force
but let get
one thing straight
you are not leaving this
house until the police arrive
lewis i know that you are just
trying to protect
your family right now
but i am telling you one thing
in all seriousness right now

we cant think like that ok
but-
no ok
do you remember
that road trip we took
to grandma nancy
when you were young
you were little
you were just five
maddie would have been seven
it was our first time ever
going through the mountains
with you kids
you kept making
us stop everywhere
so you could pick rocks
do you remember that
you guys must have
had ten pounds of rocks
back there with you
do you remember
what happened next
no
not really
we were just in
the middle of nowhere
it started to rain
and it was dark
so dark
that kind of dark you only get
when youre miles
away from anything
we rounded this corner and we
saw all these flashing lights
so we pulled over to see what
was going on and as we rolled
down the windows you could
hear this horrible moaning
and this woman crying
and then you saw it first but
we realized there was this
deer that had crashed through
the windshield and was pinning
the woman to her seat
you jumped out of the car and
maddie followed and i just had
to console you two while your
dad helped the woman out
and we stayed with her
as she waited for help
and the whole time that deer
was just making the
most horrible noise
this moan it just echoed
and you kids were
just begging us
begging us to do something
and there was just nothing
that we could do you know
your dad and i were just trying
to tell you that it was the
deer time to pass
and then the deer
it got like a second wind
it just started
like kicking madly
it kicked so hard and
it like lifted itself up
right out of the windshield
and then just bounded
off into the woods
we were all watching it run away
when maddie-
maddie said something
ill never forget
she said-
good creatures
dont die so easy
so youre the good creature
i hope so tim
i hope so
ok
wish me luck
good luck
shhhhh
i am not here to hurt you ok

what next is to move
beyond virtual reality
you see the silicon language
limits virtual reality to an
internal experience
exploring our fantasies
but within someone else idea
of a perfect environment
virtual reality is the beginning
of a whole new concept
mr burroughs is
experimenting with a variety
of different drives
worth protecting the
revolutionary virtual
reality machines
but it random you
cant control it youre more
than just a player youre god
now consumers quickly fell
in love with these enormously
entertaining titan games
however teams of highly
skilled engineers and scientists
have failed to duplicate
the technology
the reclusive billionaire
is closely associated
with titan plaza
where burroughs spends
most of his waking hours
the plain of the immortal
kill me
why me why my family

university street looks like
that it im a dead man
paramedics sort
through the carnage
-hell be coming here next
go on what are
you waiting for
make your move ms beloc
we both know youre too smart
to just stick around and wait
for the proverbial shoe to drop
tell you what you just go
to the bathroom well both
pretend youre coming back
relax i never
leave home without it
ok a atypically
candid admission
im a fan youre a master
this guy a master and ive got
the best seat in the house
this is not a game
are you out of your mind
in my games if youre very very
good if youre very very good
you should always be in control
but this is out of hand
i was so close
three or four months
-wait a minute wait a minute
i would have had it
just two or three months
i dont want to overstep
my boundaries here
so maybe if we just
talk this out we can
get a new perspective
talk this what are you
thinking this isnt therapy
this may sound simplistic
but you knew a man would
try to stop you from solving x
that why you hired us
you say you need three or
four months to crack this
the fact that he here now
is an indication that
youre closer to your solution
than you might think
or at least that what they
think
the fuck happened in that bar
mr burroughs wants
his facility locked up airtight
let go
yes sir
there are a dozen
men in the lobby
wait a minute this
guy looks familiar
jesus christ
it the guy from the ranch
yes you idiot
that why you should
have finished him off
now theyre using
his rage as a perfect
tool for my destruction
wait wait wait wait a second
maybe not so perfect
who is that
who
the woman who the woman
itll be on the police report
mr wallace you may
be about to start earning
your christmas bonus
you keep him away
for a few hours
access granted
got it
nicole carter
she a cop
what so special about her
i dont know
but a savage is supposed
to be obsessed with his
quest his calling
he shouldnt
possess any emotions
except for bloodlust and anger
but but he
he saved this woman
therefore he must care for her
which makes him vulnerable
he vulnerable
wallace here yea ok out
morning edgar
sir she just no leaving the
station if you dont mind id
like to handle this personally
fine do it
aw i think you hurt the
big ape feelings
please
please
who is it
who is it
check it out
alright just gonna loosen
the ends here
if you had to break
into this place would you hack
your way through
i could hack my way through
any code in high school
im a real student of cryptology
used to break into nsa files
missile codes fun stuff
precocious
please
may i
please
monitor out on level six
-cro-magnon
yes cro-magnon
our savage forefathers
fifty-thousand years ago
you know you continue
to impress me ms beloc
i dont understand
this is not cro-magnon
oh it absolutely is
i was a member of the original
expedition that found it
the only surviving
member as a matter of fact
the others met with a little
accident on the way home
down there
dent lester clearance two
and these pictographs
symbol cryptography
like the fraternal crypt
used by the rosicrucians
and freemasons
yes only its binary
the cryptographs translate
to key numbers which
translate to cyber text
bur cro-magnon
eden ms beloc mythical eden
all the earth
early cultures
hebrew phoenician
greek goth druid sioux
indian astic scandinavian
they all share the legend
of an extraordinary civilization
unsurpassed in spiritual
and creative genius
which vanished in a
cataclysm a deluge if you will
but that myth
why would every culture come
up with the same myth
pyramids continents apart
in egypt and south
american they bear identical
architectural features
you dont honestly believe
that a primitive people
could construct technological
marvels like easter island
and stone henge
out of sheer primitive
inspiration do you
consider this
geologists estimate
that the end of the last ice age
the one that parted
the straights of gibraltar and
filled the mediterranean basin
at around the same time
as plato and herodotus
approximated the disappearance
of atlantis
another coincidence
read the data
the virtual reality that titan
sells is nothing but a crude
version of this technology
dont you see
the ancient ones
created a virtual universe
an infinite paradise
in cyberspace
but they had to have
food and they needed labor
so they took the apes
down from the trees
our ancestors
they trained them
we are not the children
of gods ms beloc
we are the offspring of apes
im running out of time
what happened to them
with all their technology
surely they could have
survived the cataclysm
well the cataclysm
didnt annihilate them
it merely erased their
fingerprints proof of
their existence
you see theyd reached such
a level of sophistication that
they left the flesh behind
they simply transferred their
essence into cyber space
the way we digitize sound
and light they digitize matter
now they exist in a
cyber universe immortal but
powerless in this world
which is why they sent
the savage to keep me from
deciphering the
key to immortality
dont you see it all about
scaring the apes us
into sheer ignorance
you remember your bible
keep your hands off the fruit
keep your hands off the
fruit of the tree of knowledge
god messing with the
men who dared to erect
the tower of babel
its amazingly
consistent isnt it
knowledge is power
and the key to immortality
is the ultimate power
but why why would
they want to corner the
market on immortality
a cyber universe
ms beloc enough please
the end of our discourse we need
to pursue your solution now
well the first thing we
should consider is all the
binary combinations
that you ran through the
computer about the time that
the savage appeared
good
just one question
what
if i crack this
am i gonna have a
little accident too
yes
force entry zone b
abort
abort
four down three
to go mr rose
can you feed
reese
what
my name
reese good
he in the building
what
he in the building
finish up
looking for me
you are here to kill me right
well you know we better hurry
up to deliver our speeches
you know my diabolical plans
your determination to
keep me from succeeding
blah blah blah
you know what
i say the hell with it
it the 90 let watch tv
mr wallace can you hear me
yea i can hear you
let her go
oh i will
tomorrow maybe the day after
until then you just keep your
distance

your wife and child
you know we made you
a generous offer on your ranch
a very very generous offer

and this is the cave
i presume where you
found the machine

connie and hurry

pictographs but there was
something they seemed binary
that amazing
this is just the beginning

me and im gone

hey who do i trust
this is magnificent
what going on
it a generator
it the most powerful
machine ever created
but it takes time to
it takes time to warm up
in about an hour well reach
maximal dimensional thrust
and then
we digitize
a massive tremor rocked
the western united states
scientists are at a loss
to explain what is causing
the worst seismic activity
in the history of
this hemisphere
the quakes seem to be centered
at an area called spirit rock
strangely we have no record
of a fault line in this area
the damage to property
has been tremendous
woah oh my god
everyone hold on
what happening
were tearing
a hole in reality
and reality has mixed
feelings about it
daddy wanna play soldier

mr burroughs

i mean if we tear a
hole in reality
it will cause so much death
so much destruction
that there will be no
one left to dominate with
our immortality
therell be nothing
left to come back to
come back why
were ascending the heavens
to hell with the apes it just
too bad that the savage will be
too late to save them

please be careful
yes ive done it
reese get them away from me
they wont hurt you
theyre powerless in this world
when the digitized
their way to divinity
they triggered a deluge that
almost wiped out the human race
since then whenever
mankind deciphers the universe
most potent secrets
these cyber gods dispatch a
savage to keep us from
destroying ourselves
as if any self respecting
god would give a damn
all exit routes from
manhattan are clogged
as residents try to escape
from the devastation
ruptures in both the
lincoln and holland tunnels
left thousands stranded as
water levels continue to rise
can you hear me
oh god
take care of him
a tremendous fissure
has erupted
open the door
come on marie
life as we know
it is a horror story
the constant fear of
sickness age and death
teeth that rot
a back that cant
bear to stand upright
n-open the door
marie please listen to me
let go of your physical self
let go your body is keeping
your soul from freedom
i like my body reese
i think ill keep it even
if that means ill eventually
rot and die
well then you leave
me no choice
the prime minister has
declared a state of emergency
how stupid
how apelike
history
reese no
it has never been seen before
churches are filled with
panicked citizens
fearing that this is
the final judgement of mankind
if things are true
they may just be right
buildings are burning
throughout the nation
cracks in the earth have
swallowed dozens of homes
and panicked residents
are clogging the roads
attempting to escape
but there is no escape
the devastation is everywhere
the end of the world may
just be upon us
be praised the sword that
brings salvation to the world
though cruel misfortune
plagued thy steps
we offer thee now thy reward
choose now if thy will to
shed the scars of the past
the painful memory
of loved ones gone
or else choose to
embrace the past and
all you have become
the first road is peace
the other eternal war
in defense of the
meek and needy
choose and so it shall be
electrical power has
been partially restored
fire martial reports all
fires now under control
-----NewMovie-----
jerk boss
mediocre policies
should have known better
i should have known better
should have known better
what
oh honey i came
as soon as i heard
how sweet of you
did you bring me--
comfort food
i brought you cookies and wine
cheep wine
just like in college
mm
and he let me go
that aint right
and he said it was layoffs
that aint right
but i know it
just he didnt like me
because i stood up to him
but you know what kat
greener pastures ahead
a agree
you know what you didnt need
to work at the mall anyway
you have a degree
in religion
okay so then
work at a church
work at a churches
are full of drama
and you know i dont do drama
i just saw a position
today at our church
for what
executive pastor
executive pastor
mmhmm
executive pastor
hello pastor office
yes
yes
no
is that it
okay
your 500 canceled
yes
mr sandro i already told you
once the pastor gets
one free second
he will investigate a new oven
until then youre just
gonna have to make due
okay bye
sabrina sabrina
you dont have to monitor
my time like this
mr sandro been
waiting a long time
for me to fix that
oven since february
i know but you have
your 200 and your 300
and then you have
the deacon meeting
and marriage counseling
i just dont think
you can fit him in
i always got time for
stuff that important
it is not important
a new stove is not gonna help
that man cook any better
whatd you say
oh nothing
grace hightower
how are you dear
im fine pastor
just fine and you
he busy
yes i am what
can i do for you
yesterday i heard that
there was a job opening
here at the church
is that right
yes
we have an opening
for executive pastor
pastor frank quit and so we
are in desperate need of help
i mean we are in desperate need
you know anybody
that interested
yes pastor myself
excellent i think youd
make a great candidate
well you havent
seen this yet
well that amazing pastor
i didnt even think
you would think
i was qualified to do it
but ill tell you this
i have great
management experience
as well as volunteer
service here at the church
as well as college ministry
i know i know
sabrina you think we have
time for an interview
now
sir im gonna have
to advise against it
you have a media team
meeting in only 20 minutes
and like i can
but im not prepared
i didnt even think you
would take my application
actually we got time
for a group interview
what
yes sabrina grace
you both applied for
the same position
so let step into my office
and have a group session
so what makes you a good
fit for this position
well i am intimately
familiar with the duties
of both the pastor and
the executive pastor
as ive worked for both of
you for the past two years
hm grace
well i worked in a department
store for over eight years
so i have a lot of
executive like duties
that i did over there
like what
managed people
inventory control payroll
i pretty much ran the entire
day-to-day activities
over there
hm and what is your
greatest weakness
well i have to say
my greatest weakness is
im too meticulous focusing
on tasks with perfection
i mean i just
dont like to have
things fall through the cracks
hm that sounds good grace
that good
my greatest weakness
would be um
i care about people too much
the last job that i was with
it was a business
about making money
but people would come in
employees would come in
and they would ask for
advances against their checks
you know and i would feel
sorry for them pastor
and so i think that the
reason why i got fired
mm
sir is there anything
that i can help you with
after all that is my job
i just got an email from haiti
and im about to leave on
an emergency right away
right now
yes
and im gonna leave
you two in charge
what
good morning sabrina
morning
hm up early
i always do something
the pastor really likes
hm did he make
it okay yesterday
uh i havent heard
from him but uh
i will follow up when he
should arrive at the orphanage
okay good
um so um
where do i sit
i was thinking the lobby
shouldnt i have a desk
well this is my desk
and the only other
desk is the pastor
and i really dont think it
appropriate for you to use it
okay so um what
am i supposed to do
just work on my phone
huh that works for me
i have an idea
why dont we switch
why dont you work
here in the morning
and then ill come
in the afternoon
and ill work here on the desk
like i said this is my desk
i know where everything is
it is organized with
optimal efficiency
and ergonomics in mind
for me to leave this desk
would send this church
into a downward spiral
of tragedy and disaster
particularly when
the pastor is gone
mm
actually it would just be
really awkward with you here
mmhmm yeah
awkward all right
oh god
listen sabrina i
understand that you feel like
you are more qualified
than me that fine
but the pastor put
both of us in charge
weve got to stay here and
work together as a team
see it would be nice
if i needed the help
but i have this
all under control
personally i think that the
pastor felt sorry for you
because you got fired
for being too nice
mm that was uncalled for
just like you being here
this is a church
were supposed to be a team
im not here for this bull--
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
what in the siegfried and
roy is going on in here
oh deacon thompson im
sorry did she disturb you
well im having a
prayer meeting over there
im hearing all this
bickering over here
now what the problem
oh we just were
having a bit of conflict
about a job opening
oh what job opening
uh the executive
pastor position
executive pastor position
first time im
hearing about this
well i heard
about it from kat
the wino daughter
look as head deacon i should
at least know about this
well i am so sorry
i forgot to post it
on the church website
but probably wont
need it anyway
well why is that
well because the
pastor has placed myself
and her--
and me
in charge in his absence
so you know
i guess whoever does the
best will get the position
well what is
this position pay
60 grand vision
health retirement--
and we get what
the church house
church house you
mean the two bedroom
the two bath garage that
grill and basic cable
you sound
like a game show host
and a jacuzzi right
mmhmm
i could use that bump
mmhmm
well hey where
the pastor at anyway
oh he went to haiti
haiti
yeah
when the pastor gets back
i need to talk to
him immediately
you hear me right
loud and clear
thank you
jacuzzi oh yeah
scuse me can i help you
miss grace that you honey
yes--
how you doing
im fine miss pumpkin
how can i help you today
no im looking for pastor
oh well im here
in his absence
is there something
that i can do for you
uh ill just
talk to sabrina--
no no no that
what im here for
im here to help
what can i do for you today
okay well
i need to talk to the pastor
about these choir robes
uh huh
i mean theyre old and
frayed and we keep altering em
instead of replacing
em with new ones
okay well then how
much does it cost
i dont know sabrina
does all of that
okay well let me help you
let me figure
something out for you
okay how many robes is it
okay okay wow that a lot
i didnt know we had that
many people in the choir
well you know it
takes a lot to make
a joyful noise like us
you know what i mean
yes yes
okay so oh im gonna
find a price point for you
and ill be in contact
with you and let you know
how much it costs--
no look
im just gonna deal
with sabrina cause
working with you is redundant
but i really do appreciate you
i mean i really do
miss
pumpkin how are you
hi
sabrina my girl
miss grace
yes oh hi mr sandros
i heard you talking
about these robes
uh huh yeah are
you in the choir

to see you about an oven
a brand new gas weve
got to have a gas oven
i know and i heard that youre
one of the best cooks here
chicken and dumplings
chicken and dumplings
look i need some money
okay but the thing is
we dont have a budget
right now for an oven
we really dont
should a budget be an issue
when im trying to stop serving
these people burnt food

ill holler at you later on
im going for the help
sabrina

oh  thank
you but no thank you
and you youre always working
well you know they keep
me working miss grace
yes but you know we have
some new young congregates here

talk to pastor about that
that a good idea
oh you didnt hear
hm hear what
they going to haiti huh
yes he went to haiti
wow
im having like a
really rough day today
what going on with you
well i lost my job--

contest against sabrina
executive
i dont see you as an executive
what do you mean
oh no no not like that
it just youre too nice
i see you more in
the missionary work
yeah yeah yeah i could
see myself doing that
maybe one day ill go out
the country you know
a cultured woman
such as yourself
has never been out
of the country
i find that hard to believe
one day i will go though
i will go out of the country
yeah and uh maybe
i could tag along

with you huh
i can be subtle sometimes
all right
well have a beautiful
day mr troy
you do the same miss grace
there my girl hi

hi bessie joe it
so good to see you

to see you too
but usually aint up
here in this afternoon
i know im here to help
the pastor while he away
girl you got a good heart

yes yes i do have a
heart for this church
because if you love the
church and you love god
you will be blessed
that right
but you know i
won the lottery
i won $500
today
girl no that was in 993
but if i keep the faith and
believe in god ima win again
miss bessie
youre a crazy fool
for loving the lord

until i do im not gonna quit
im gonna win this lottery
in the name of jesus
girl ill see you later

mm amen
crazy lady

in the collection plate
who
deacon thompson
cant say that
about somebody--
i got proof and i
wanna bust him out
in front of the congregation
okay no no no
before you do that
look i have an idea tell
me the evidence that you have
and then ill present
it to the pastor
sweetheart you pretty
but you aint that pretty
you cant solve this problem
usher mike
deacon thompson
you know he dipping
in the collection plate
and he smokes
marijuana cigarettes
oh my god what is
wrong with these people
what do you mean
back stabbing
betrayals gossip
this is why i left
he corporate world
you know a lot
of people think
that working at a church
is a bed of roses
they forget about the thorns
oh man but what
if the silver linings
of leaving the corporate
world is avoiding politics
and boss butt kissing
ive been here
for almost one day
and everybody here
stressing me out
one day grace one day
this job is probably
not for you
this is probably a
sign of what to come
oh dont fret yourself honey
mother thomas you always
find a way to sneak up on us
that how you hear all
the good gossip honey
she always does that
i think when she dies
she gonna haunt us
and were not gonna even
know the difference
you got a funny
way of saying things
but im not sure what youre
saying is good or bad
mother thomas
you know i love you
that-a-girl
look grace darling
dont come in here
and get yourself caught
up with all this nonsense
that goes along with our church
it was here before jesus
was walking the earth
and itll be here after
what
matters is your heart
and whether you act or not on
the love that jesus put there
everything else is
babbly nonsense
here have a snack baby
no mother thomas
i just dont understand why
the church is so flawed
that the whole point
the church is the one
place that people can go
be themselves and still
be accepted none-the-less
you of all people
should know that grace
ow
dammit
i mean shoot
see what i mean
hey hi

it okay i have
everything under control
okay
youre kind of an
accessory right now anyway
who made you so mean
my momma told me to go after
what i want whole-heartedly
so if that makes me mean
then you have to blame her

talking about my momma

what that all about deacon
yeah
im missing my program
i got to know find out what
happened to diane kreeger
and her mistress
have you heard of
a dvr bessie jo
boy i dont mess
with that nonsense
you know the man is watching us
dont you know that
calm down i
called this meeting
because i have some unfortunate
news from yesterday
it seems our executive pastor
was taking money from the
church for the past three years
how much money
well how bad is it
were gonna lose the building
calm down calm down calm down
we gotta find that
man and string him up
that what im talking about
perhaps maybe someday
but not right now
right now we only have one
week left in this building
a building that weve called
home for the past 88 years
ive watched most
of you grow up here
that is unless our own
grace hightower can help us
all right grace
oh well she pretty
but that about it
ill believe it when i see it
well she assured
me she has a plan
so let hear the lady talk
come on grace
hello all hello
praise the lord
i fell asleep reading the
foreclosure papers last night
and while sleeping
i had a dream
that i was there when jesus fed
the 5000 people in matthew 4
and you were all there too
hallelujah
except for bessie joe
she was off somewhere
gambling fish
hallelujah
that bessie joe
in this dream a
little boy showed up
with five loaves of
bread and two fish
and everybody laughed
at him and they sneered
and they started
packing up to leave
but then jesus showed up
with his eyes deep
with the confidence
of the good shepard
the apostles they were scared
but jesus was confident
dont play
oh my god he just
started passing fish
fish all around
i was way in the
back in the dream
the fish was going
to get to me guys
there were people behind
me people beside me
i thought they were just gonna
fight to get to the fish
but they didnt have to
we all got fish
including you guys
we all got food
offa the fish
and that when i realized
our god is an abundant god
he makes a way out of no way
and i believe god
showed me that dream
to represent this church
i believe our miracle is
found in this here document
that right
what does it say
it says that if we can
get this debt paid off
before their next meeting
the church is ours to keep
well how we gonna do that
and how much do we
owe three $400000
2 million

get this thing off my head
what going on
what the meaning of this
listen listen i was going
to pay the money back
when after your two week
trip to the dominican republic
maybe
sabrina come on
pastor youre back
good morning grace
good morning when
did you get back
this morning
you must be exhausted
yes i heard
about pastor frank
pastor tomorrow
we lose the church
unless we come up with $500000
and that exactly what
i wanna talk to you about
my church
hey
good morning church
what a beautiful day it is
it goes without saying that
it been a tumultuous week
and i play a big part in that
and i wish to apologize to
you all first and foremost
as you may or may not know
im part of our
denominational missions board
and there was a major
tragedy in haiti
they needed me as
soon as possible
and still need people
if you feel god
tug on your heart
to serve our brothers and
sisters in another country
as a result i was mia for
the past couple of weeks
though i feel those
who stepped up
to lead this church in my
absence did a spectacular job
particularly grace and sabrina
i sincerely thank you both
which leads me to my
next announcement
as you know our executive
pastor mr frank
quit a few weeks ago and
moved out of the state
and with him he
took our mortgage
that he stole over the
past couple of years
leaving us unexpectedly
with a massive debt
the litigations will begin
shortly i assure you
but that doesnt negate the
issues we face as a church
how can we keep this building
how can we keep our
home of over 80 years
i understand miss
grace hightower
managed to muster up
about 60% of what we need
which is an amazing
feat in itself
but there is still a deficit
and a large one at that
so what do we do
we find ourselves in a
valley a dark valley
and not from our
own doing this time
someone pushed us but this
shouldnt be a surprise
for god assures us that
this life is filled with
both valleys and peaks
but what would a peak look like
without experiencing the valley
furthermore the one
who caused us the fall
what should we say about him
do we condemn him or forgive
as our lord im
sure already has
i would argue that
the first step
towards escaping this
valley is forgiveness
and so i urge all of
you to find your own way
to let go of this sin and
once we have forgiven again
follow in the footsteps of
the one we claim to follow
once we have with his help
moved past the offense the
next step is to simply look up
though it be dark in the valley
the sun will yet rise and
though it will take time
for the blessed rays to strive
our darkest faces they will
and when they do the path of
the darkness will be revealed
and we can step forward
i am very happy to stand
here today and say that
your prayers have been answered
it seems that while
i was in haiti
a fellow missionary
who i have never met
approached me
he is from a church about
our size in illinois
one that has done
great work worldwide
and domestically even
here in los angeles
this man approached me and said
he felt a tug on his heart
about three months ago
to raise a significant
amount of money
for an unknown congregation
somewhere in
southern california
one he felt was located none
other than the city of angels
and as it turns out
this man church
managed to raise exactly
a half million dollars an
incredible amount of money
for an unknown cause
am i right
now before you all start
looking for jobs in illinois
some of you may know that
despite your valent efforts
in fund raising
we are short exactly a
half million dollars
plus a few cents which is
why it was 00% god doing
when this man approached me
and offered all of the money
he had to give to
us to our church
hallelujah
let let this
celebration begin
amen
amen
amen amen hallelujah
amen

﻿
bienvenidos a todos
me alegra mucho que estén aquí
me encanta la navidad
lo admito me encanta todo
lo de la época navideña
me encantan las galletas
me encanta el fuego
me encantan los regalos las botas
el árbol el caramelo las luces
es una gran época para
dejarse la barba de invierno
la música los villancicos
los himnos los niños
y me encanta el espíritu
en la época navideña
a dondequiera que vayas hay algo
que hace que la gente
quiera ser más amable
en navidad quieren ser más
compasivos ayudar más
ser más generosos
las donaciones aumentan
en todo el mundo
hay algo que hace que la gente
invite a los demás
que quiera sacarlos del frio
para ayudarlos
vestirlos y alimentarlos
y lo mejor de todo creo
que hay algo en la navidad
que todos sentimos
en lo más profundo de nosotros que dice
algo muy grande ocurrió
y por ello
todo va a estar bien
¡y me encanta el chocolate caliente
pero si se han dado cuenta
hay algunas personas que
quisieran cubrir todo esto
con una gran manta blanca
no quieren que amemos tanto la navidad
y la celebramos de la
manera que lo hacemos
hay un grupo por aquí
que dice
oigan si quieren cantar sus canciones
y hacer sus cosas en navidad está bien
pero háganlo en voz baja
no canten tan fuerte
¿cierto mantengan sus
asuntos entre ustedes
y déjenlos en su casa
no permitan que se propague
entre el público y nos
moleste al resto de nosotros
sólo manténganlo en privado
y luego está ese otro grupo aquí
que de hecho está adentro
y que nos está diciendo
¿saben todo lo que
están haciendo todo esto
las figuras los personajes
las tradiciones todas están mal
nada tienen que ver con la navidad
de hecho deberían sacar
todo eso envolverlo
y lanzarlo por la puerta
porque todo es malo
¿y qué harán después
¿decirnos que el chocolate
caliente es malo
¿qué los druidas lo inventaron
¿y qué se supone que debemos hacer
quiero decir puede ser
muy confuso y esta discusión
definitivamente no le hace
ningún bien a nuestros hijos
tal vez
necesitemos una opinión externa
una voz
alguien que pueda recordarnos
el verdadero significado de la navidad
porque tal vez en algún punto del camino
perdimos de vista
la verdadera historia
tal vez no sea la correcta
o
tal vez estemos escuchando
a la gente equivocada
o
tal vez
sólo tal vez
¿alguien como santa claus
de hecho está en el equipo
¡señor
vete de aquí
está aquí señor
¿dónde
aquí en la taberna
trae mi abrigo
las historias son algo engañosas
sobre todo aquellas que
hemos escuchado muchas veces
hubo alguna vez que no nos importaba
escuchar las mismas
historias una y otra vez
cuando éramos niños
insistíamos en escucharlas
de manera interminable
le rogábamos a nuestros padres
hasta que se daban por vencidos
o accedían
después crecimos
y pensamos
que quizá ya era hora
de historias nuevas
queríamos ser sorprendidos
queríamos más emociones y giros
y no nos parecía si algo resultaba
demasiado predecible
y luego tuvimos nuestros propios hijos
y les contamos las mismas historias
que nuestros padres
nos contaron a nosotros
sólo que sentimos que
tal vez las historias
eran demasiado aterradoras
y nos preocupaba que el lobo o la bruja
pudieran provocarles pesadillas
así que suavizamos
un poco a los villanos
o hasta los excluimos por completo
y nuestros héroes fueron domados
y transformados a un
tamaño más manejable
necesitaban ser menos intensos más
agradables
pero las historias que oímos
y las historias que
contamos nos forman
nos enseñan cómo vivir
al mostrarnos cómo vivir
ustedes y yo estamos
en una historia ahora
y cómo entramos a esa historia
es lo que importa
hola
hola a todos ese soy
yo disfrutando la fiesta
y ella es mi hermana
es la anfitriona de la fiesta
a nadie le gustan más las
fiestas de navidad que a ella
¡cómo siempre increíble
¡oye este año te luciste
trajiste a santa claus
¿dónde lo encontraste
¿cuánto tuviste que pagarle
es el tío bill
debe ser por la barba no lo reconocí
oye ¿el tío bill trabaja tiene empleo
no por eso lo contratamos
¡no
¿y dónde está christian
está en la otra sala
¿sí ¿y cómo le va
¿está bien
sí sí
sí está bien ¿estás segura
sí
no sí
oye oye
¡oye
¿quieres que le dé su
merecido ¿te hizo algo
no
porque puedo ir ahora mismo
¡no
no está bien en serio
sólo que este año no está
muy animado por la navidad
eso es todo
muy bien ¿quién quiere
chocolate caliente
¡hay chocolate caliente amigos vengan
¿recuerdan que les dije
que ustedes y yo
¿estábamos en medio de una historia
la diferencia entre nuestra historia
y las historias que
escuchamos cuando somos niños
es que nosotros ayudamos
a escribir la nuestra
y podemos escoger ser
el héroe o el villano
podemos ser el sabio
o el tonto
podemos ser el pequeño tim
o el tío scrooge
hasta el tío scrooge tiene una historia
y tiene sus razones
los problemas no desaparecen
sólo porque es navidad
tal vez alguien no recibió
su bono navideño este año
o tal vez perdió su empleo
o incluso a un ser querido
o tal vez
sólo tal vez
no le gusta la navidad
bajo ninguna circunstancia
y ese es christian
mi cuñado
mi hermana no estaba exagerando
este año no tiene espíritu navideño
uno no conoce la historia de alguien
hasta que ves lo que
sucede dentro de su cabeza
donde unos ven felicidad
otros ven sonrisas
falsas y niños malcriados
donde unos ven risas y ánimo
otros ven falsedad y obligaciones
donde unos ven decoración navideña
otros ven símbolos pervertidos
con significados ocultos
donde unos ven juguetes inocentes
otros ven distracciones sin sentido
donde unos ven generosidad
y felicidad de dar
otros ven gastos innecesarios
y mala administración
comercialismo codicia basura
materialismo paganismo
adoración a duendes
y la lista sigue y sigue
algunas personas están
decididas en ver lo peor
aun en la mejor de las cosas
una gran bofetada al verdadero
significado de la navidad
querido amigo christian ¿cómo te va
¿qué hay d andré ¿cómo has estado
ya me conoces estoy bendecido
¿y
salvo y santificado
lleno del espíritu santo
y libre del fuego eterno
¿y
difundiendo la palabra por supuesto
ustedes y sus versículos
tienes que trabajar en tu jesús extra
¿jesús extra
ya tuve mi jesús extra
desde que me bautizaron
la segunda vez
¡chócalas
no es lo que
¿recibiste ¿recibiste esa nota
¿sobre qué
no más viernes de camisas locas
¿de quién
del jefe
del corporativo
creen que van a decirnos
qué tenemos que hacer
iremos a recursos humanos
irá a recursos humanos enviará correos
no nos pueden quitar el
viernes de camisas locas
es nuestro fin ¡es todo lo que tenemos
¿qué más van a hacernos después
¿cambiarnos al segundo piso no quiero
¿sabes qué pasa en el segundo piso
yo no ni quiero averiguarlo
porque estoy en el piso cuatro
y así me gusta haremos
una marcha si es necesario
juntaremos nuestras fuerzas tú y yo
mi gente ya soportó suficiente
primero te dicen qué hacer
y luego toman el control
te dicen que no podemos
tener los viernes
ni los jueves ni los
martes ¿y qué nos queda
¡el miércoles pero es
su día no el nuestro
y nosotros necesitamos un día
¡el viernes de camisas locas
¿sabes cuantas camisas locas
me han regalado en navidad
¿qué voy a hacer con ellas
¿me estás escuchando
¿qué
iré por chocolate caliente
te veo luego para enviar el correo
y cuando vemos a alguien
luchando con la navidad
debemos
apoyarlo
¡oye christian
no
no está aquí
sólo bill en el sillón
y si esa persona no aparece
en la fiesta de navidad
especialmente si es
en su propia casa
un buen lugar para buscar
sería en un lugar tranquilo
libre de navidad
el auto en la entrada
verán si esta fuera una historia
ahí es exactamente donde
esperarían que lo encontrara
y sabrían que este
personaje necesita
una intervención
hola
hola
me preguntaba dónde estabas
sólo tú sabes
tomándome un descanso
¿estás bien
sí
sí es sólo que es
ruidoso tú sabes
cuando manejaba hoy
de regreso a casa
en la calle principal
todo estaba iluminado
y pasé junto a una tienda y vi
a una niña con su mamá
y la niña tenía esa
mirada en la cara de
y su mamá la veía con
cara de está bien
y la mamá traía bolsas se veía que
habían estado haciendo compras
y la niña estaba tan molesta
obviamente lo que quería
no lo iba a obtener
todo el mundo quiere algo
y luego llego aquí
y veo la comida el jamón un jamón
no sabía que habíamos
comprado un jamón tan grande
veo los regalos veo
veo el árbol veo
veo a santa
¿y qué vamos a hacer
vamos a abrir esos regalos
y mis sobrinos se van a emocionar
y dentro de tres semanas
nadie jugará con ellos
y con ese dinero gastado
¿cuántos niños habríamos
podido alimentar
¿cuántos pozos habríamos
podido perforar
sí
eso es la navidad
no no
amigo
yo amo a tu hermana
la amaré hasta morir
y a ella le encanta hacer esto
le encanta
encender las luces y
pero cuando veo qué es la navidad
veo que
que esta no puede ser
lo que dios quiere
y en el rincón metido en el rincón hay
una pequeña bola de nieve
un pequeño nacimiento
un pequeño niño jesús
que colocamos en algún
lugar en un rincón
donde realmente no se ve
porque es algo insignificante
mientras un gran árbol de navidad
miren el gran árbol en el centro
soy la pieza central de la navidad
y santa está allí y aquí en el rincón
colocamos a jesús pongámoslo ahí
y coloquémosle un vidrio encima
agítalo y voltéalo es invierno
y nieve cae sobre el niño jesús
y de hecho él no nació en diciembre
esto no es de lo que
se trata la navidad
te escucho
entiendo
chócalas
pero todo esto está mal
todo esto está mal
no
tú estás mal
¿sobre qué
sobre todo lo que acabas de decir
dije mucho
si y todo está mal
creo que tienes buenas intenciones
pero estás equivocado en todo
tú te lo creaste todo
tú tú
tú mordiste el anzuelo caíste
te lo creaste todo
¿y adivina qué todo
lo que ves ahí adentro
todo tiene que ver con la navidad
todo tiene que ver con jesús
y tú lo estás arruinando todo
no sólo a tu esposa
si no a todos en tu casa
estás escuchando a la gente equivocada
¿estamos viendo la misma fiesta
¿estamos viendo lo mismo
que está sucediendo ahí
¡si
bien está bien entonces
explícame
cuando entró a esa fiesta navideña
que se celebra en todo el mundo
explícame cómo
esa fiesta navideña
honra y glorifica
a jesús
porque yo no lo veo
¿por dónde empiezo
empecemos con el nacimiento
la natividad
quiero que lo visualices
cierra los ojos y
visualiza esto
está bien bien haré lo que me digas
lo veo
nació un bebé
si tuvieran que escoger una cosa valiosa
de toda la decoración
de su casa en navidad
probablemente sería el nacimiento
pero christian no creo que hayas visto
lo asombroso de esa escena
pensar que es valiosa simplemente porque
el niño jesús está ahí
hace que omitas una gran parte
de lo que está sucediendo
el nacimiento del bebé es valioso
por toda la historia que implica
quiero que veas una cueva
no un establo o un
granero en alguna pradera
primero que nada
un pesebre se utiliza para alimentar
probablemente está tallado en una roca
y estará en una cueva
y en esa roca alimentarás
a tus animales
ahora vayamos más allá
de lo lindo y tradicional
donde todo es seguro y suave
donde todos tienen tez
blanca y ropa limpia
imagina una cueva
y un lugar para comer
ahora contaremos la
historia correctamente
este era un niño que
nació en un mundo
donde querían matarlo
tan sólo por nacer
quiero que pienses en
soldados rodeándolos
piensa en los soldados
de herodes avanzando
por las calles buscando
bebés y asesinándolos
y madres llorando por sus hijos
veamos el escenario
nos aseguramos de tener a maría ahí
arrodillada ante su
milagro recién nacido
josé está ahí
seguramente sorprendido por lo que pasó
el niño jesús está ahí
y la biblia hace que nos
fijemos en algo que nosotros
normalmente consideramos como utilería
quitemos todo por un momento
quitemos a josé
dejando sola a una joven mujer
y a su hijo recién nacido
ahora quitamos a maría
dejando al bebé
y quitamos al bebé sólo por un momento
no se asustan no es porque no sea
la persona más importante
de la historia lo es
pero al ver esta escena
nos daremos una mejor idea
de la razón por la cual él nació
las mantas
¿qué son las mantas
¿sólo es una manta para bebé
normalmente sólo
pensamos en el niño jesús
envuelto en mantas
pero la biblia trae estas mantas
a la historia una vez más
en su tumba
cuando retiraron esa piedra
las mantas y la
tumba estaban vacías
porque no pudieron retener el cuerpo
envuelto en su interior
jesús escapó de la
muerte cuando era un bebé
por la gracia de dios
y conquistó la muerte como adulto
por la misma gracia
y porque esa manta no podía retenerlo
la muerte tampoco pudo vencer
¿se han preguntado
por qué los reyes magos
¿llevaron incienso y
mirra a su nacimiento
eso se usa en un entierro
¿por qué llevar algo que se usa
en un entierro a un nacimiento
la escena del nacimiento es la imagen
de un próximo funeral
aunque los soldados no
lograron matar al bebé
él vino para morir
pero acorde a los planes de su padre
en su momento y bajo sus términos
la muerte de jesús no fue el
trágico final de la historia
siempre fue el plan
ofrecer su cuerpo como
pan para los hambrientos
y derramar su sangre
para cubrir los pecados
de los culpables
ahora coloquemos a jesús
de nuevo en esa manta
y deja que esa imagen
pinte el cuadro para ti
un bebé que vino para morir
pero no hasta el tiempo correcto
si esa es la razón de esta temporada
justo ahí
tengo que admitirlo nunca vi
todo el significado de
de la manta
yo tampoco
pero ese es mi punto como
puedo abrir la biblia
puedo mirar ahí y exclamar
ahí está ¡ni siquiera lo había visto
¡eso me asombra eso es
eso es todo lo que estoy diciendo
y
los soldados de herodes
y verlo de esa manera
es
siento que necesitamos
a esos soldados de herodes
a nuestro alrededor
tú sabes la tiranía
así es
ves lo que está sucediendo
así es
así es
mi amigo d andré ¿qué hay
¿recibiste la nota
tú sabes que la recibí
y no es un asunto de risa amigo
¿sabes qué está sucediendo
sí
no no no lo sé
tres palabras
guerra
en
navidad
sí
creo que lo mejor para nosotros
antes de continuar sería tener cuidado
nunca se sabe quién está escuchando
o mirando
arriba tazas
bien tenemos que tomar la ofensiva
como dicen si estás
listo no debes alistarte
ya nos quitaron la
libertad de expresión
ya no puedo decir feliz navidad
ahora tengo que decir
felices fiestas
pero estoy consciente
y sí qué hay detrás
¿has oído del área 5
¿y qué hay del área 52
ahí es donde mantienen
todas las intrigas y
actividades que nos prohíben
hablando de eso ¿sabes
por qué renunció el papa
el código da vinci ¿cierto
falso hay un código picasso
aún siguen trabajando en él
le ponen algo a nuestra agua
y eso debe afectar las hamburguesas
hablando de hamburguesas
probablemente hace años
que no te comes una
ya no son de res son desechos
¿sabes qué tienes que hacer
hazlo que hago yo come
carne de avestruz amigo
es deliciosa y exótica
vamos quieren controlar el clima
con los sonidos esos wamp wamp
y los transgénicos los pesticidas
sabías que hay una gran
sequía de miel de abeja
exacto el colapso de las colonias
que es parte del nuevo orden mundial
¿coincidencia no creo
he visto los cambios
si qué está sucediendo
con todos ellos halliburton
dick cheney enron
fannie mae freddie mac
por favor eso es obvio
mira amigo lo vi en
el noticiero de fox
y sabes que es verdad
guerra contra navidad
está por doquier
¡oigan ¿quién quiere más café
no estamos bien ¡está delicioso
bien creo que no hay
problema abajo tazas
sabes lo que tenemos que hacer ¿cierto
¿qué
lo único que podemos hacer
árboles de navidad
¡noticia de última hora
¡el árbol de navidad
no está en la biblia
mateo marcos lucas
juan deuteronomio
levítico se me olvidó alguno
no conozco muy bien los evangelios
pero estoy bastante
seguro que no está ahí
y esa gran cosa la
tengo ahora en mi casa
un gran árbol de navidad
¡es pagana ¡es un símbolo de idolatría
lo sabes ¿cierto
con eso adoramos a los dioses
¿tú sabes los dioses
¿qué dioses
¡los dioses
¿qué dioses
thor cirrus siempre es
siempre es noruego
era por la temporada de invierno
¡noticia de última hora ¡es diciembre
jesús no nació en
diciembre y estamos celebrando
su nacimiento en diciembre
¿hola
¿y cuándo nació
probablemente
él
probablemente
no sé pero no nació en diciembre
y todos saben eso
y lo estamos celebrando
y
y los árboles representan
sí
vida eterna
sí
y la fertilidad
a los dioses de la fertilidad
wikipedia
sí
y la gente
adorará esos símbolos
y creen que si adoran estos símbolos
y les hacen ofrendas ellos
así es
heredarán la vida eterna
ya te diste cuenta
y que todo esto es idolatría
sí es idolatría en mi casa
¿cómo reaccionan tus hijos
cada mañana en navidad
¿qué hacen dime
¿qué hacen
les digo a mis hijos que
esperen arriba en la escalera
no dejo que bajen las escaleras
hasta que mi esposa y yo
tengamos todo listo en el árbol
así que cuando les
digo que pueden bajar
bajan corriendo las escaleras
corren al árbol y se impresionan
con todos los regalos
que hay debajo del árbol
eso es exactamente lo que
hicieron los sacerdotes druidas
¿sí
druidas
consúltalo esto es historia
¿así que
¿dónde
preguntaré de nuevo
¿dónde están los árboles
de navidad en la biblia
me alegra que preguntes
cerraré mis ojos de nuevo
aquí voy estoy esperando bien
¿cuál es el capítulo el versículo
¿hay algún versículo raro
en números ¿para dónde voy
¿dónde empiezo a buscar en la biblia
¡árboles de navidad estoy
esperando ¿dónde están
me alegra que mi hermana
se casara contigo
esto es increíble
hermano hermano mírame
¿dónde empiezo a buscar en la biblia
génesis
lote de árboles
toda la historia bíblica empieza
en un lote de árboles
el jardín del edén
estaba lleno de árboles
a adán y a eva se les dio el
fruto de esos árboles para comer
pero en la historia
hay dos de estos árboles
que llaman nuestra atención
primero el árbol del
conocimiento del bien y el mal
y luego más tarde el árbol de la vida
un árbol estaba prohibido
porque al comerlo
el hombre seguramente moriría
pero adán comió del primer árbol
y fue expulsado del
paraíso para que no pudiera
comer del segundo
la humanidad tendría que esperar
hasta que el camino a ese árbol
fuera reabierto
pero me estoy adelantando
regresaremos a eso después
hablemos de ese árbol
que está en tu casa
decorado con frutas y
luces con mucho estilo
que te pone tan nervioso
estás ansioso porque no puedes
encontrarlo en la biblia
pues déjame ayudarte
cuando dios creó el mundo
lo llenó con árboles
y puso fruta en los árboles
y cuando fue hora de construir
su casa y embellecerla
dios puso árboles dentro de ella
las paredes de su templo fueron pintadas
con imágenes de árboles
la base de su trono era un almendro
¡y adivina qué colocó
¡en las ramas del árbol en su casa
luces
bellos árboles verdes
decorados con fruta
llenos de luces dentro de una casa
fue idea de dios
no de los druidas
y la iglesia antigua
tendría tantas buenas razones
para celebrar el nacimiento de jesús
el 25 de diciembre
y nada tenía que ver con
la temporada de invierno
por cierto la última vez que revise
fue dios quien hizo la
temporada de invierno
cuando colocó los planetas
en su trayectoria alrededor del sol
y de hecho es correcto que celebramos
el nacimiento de jesús
a mediados de invierno
cuando el mundo parece
estar dormido y muriendo
la época más oscura y fría del año
justo en ese momento
estamos proclamando
el cambio de la historia
de la oscuridad a la luz
de la frialdad a la calidez
y de la muerte a la vida
así que ya basta
con lo que los idólatras
quieren que veamos
veamos lo que dios quiere que veamos
regresemos a nuestra historia
como estaba diciendo
adán se robó el fruto del
árbol de dios en el edén
ahora cuando te robas
algo tienes que devolverlo
pero ¿cómo podría hacerlo
adán ya se lo había comido
estaba dentro de él
y ya era parte de él
la única manera en que adán
podía regresar el fruto
en el árbol sería
por muy extraño que se escuche
él tendría que ponerse en el árbol
ahora piensen
¿qué hizo jesús
él fue el último adán
jesús fue capaz de hacer
lo que adán no pudo hacer
él se puso arriba en un árbol
haciéndonos quedar bien ante dios
jesús fue el fruto bendecido por dios
colgado en su árbol bendecido
¿recuerdan las mantas
regresamos a la historia de nuevo
en el funeral de jesús
nicodemo llevó todos los
preparativos para el funeral
incienso mirra aloes y manta
¿y por qué llevó la manta
para envolver el cuerpo de
nuestro salvador crucificado
jesús
quien murió en un árbol
la biblia comienza con árboles
adán robó el fruto del
árbol de dios en el edén
el fruto que robó el primer adán
fue devuelto al árbol
por el último adán
cuando él mismo se colgó
en una cruz de madera
así que cuando entres a un
lote de árboles navideños
quiero que veas cientos de cruces
que nunca serán usadas
por lo que hizo jesús por nosotros
él pagó el precio
que nosotros nunca
hubiéramos podido pagar
él recibió la maldición que era nuestra
él nos reconcilió con dios
él es la luz del mundo
que atravesó la oscuridad
así que cuando veas
árboles de navidad vacíos
ve en ellos una cruz vacía
y cuando veas la cruz vacía
ve la manta vacía
en una tumba vacía
y cuando veas una tumba vacía
haz lo que hicieron los discípulos
date vuelta y corre a
contar la historia
de que jesús está vivo
es maravilloso
es increíble
es sólo que no estaba
ahora me siento mal
no estaba viendo
detenidamente el yo no
no lo había visto así
¡oye yo tampoco lo había visto
y por eso lo estoy compartiendo contigo
santa claus
en la biblia
al menos no he visto en
la biblia donde dice que
dios envía a su único
¿duende
un duende un tipo llamado santa
¿renos jalando un trineo
dime en este momento
que no vas a explicarme
¿deslizándose por una chimenea
sofonías cuatro
o corintios 35 que diga
¡ahí está santa claus
no lo había visto
dímelo ¿estamos bien
no
¿no hay nada bien
pero
espera puedo decir con toda certeza
que no hay ningún santa
claus en la biblia
no no hay ningún santa
claus en la biblia pero
¡bien
no aguarda
espera espera
sólo piénsalo
sólo piénsalo un minuto
ese es el tipo santa
que
¡que hizo que nos olvidáramos de jesús
¡jesús ha desaparecido
la razón de esta
temporada es santa claus
lo que los niños dicen
alrededor del mundo no es
¡estoy tan emocionado de celebrar
¡el nacimiento de jesús
no ellos dicen ¡estoy tan emocionado
¡de tomarme una foto con santa claus
¿qué regalos me vas a traer
sa-n-t-a si reacomodamos
las letras dice satán
santa satán mismas letras
así es
así es
¿coincidencia
sí
bien ¿y quién se deshizo
completamente de jesús
satán
santa
¿dónde está jo jo jo en la biblia
¿jo jo jo en la biblia
sabes mi amor pórtate bien
no debes llorar sabes por qué
santa claus llegó a la ciudad
¿y qué sigue
te observa cuando duermes
te mira al despertar
cierto
no intentes ocultarte de él
pues siempre te verá
él sabe de ti
él recompensa a los buenos
y castiga a los malos
cierto
la última vez que revisé ese era dios
ese era su trabajo
la última vez que revisé
eras salvado por su gracia
esto es un completo secuestro
este es un secuestro
un verdadero secuestro
en toda la extensión
de la palabra
es un secuestro pero de nuestra fe
¿y adivina qué santa se
subió al auto y bajó a jesús
y condujo y condujo y se lo llevó
se marchó
la navidad desapareció
todo tiene que ver con santa
eso es falso
¿dónde está eso en la biblia
¿dónde está eso en la biblia
letra roja letra roja ¿dónde está
bien espera no puedo
esperar para esta vez
aquí vamos aquí vamos ya estoy listo
ya cerré los ojos
lo estoy viendo lo veo
espera veo su cara
veo su cara
¿qué ves
a un duende
en un trineo
así es
y trae su capa roja
s¡
su traje rojo y trae
un saco en la espalda
s¡
y es jalado por unos renos
así es no está en la biblia
y va a aterrizar en el techo
y se va a deslizar por la chimenea
y va a llenar medias y colocar regalos
alrededor de la base del árbol
así es ¿cierto
sí
bien
déjame contarte sobre
el verdadero santa claus
estoy listo
el verdadero santa claus era
un tipo verdaderamente malo
y cuando digo malo
me refiero a malo en el buen sentido
bien christian
¿quieres que en la navidad
todo tenga que ver con jesús
¿crees que estás dando
una buena pelea al
despreciar la decoración
burlándote de los regalos
y de los árboles de navidad
permíteme mostrarte cómo lo hace
un verdadero defensor de la fe
ahora si trato de mostrarte
cómo sucedió realmente
verás a muchos tipos con capas
usando sombreros altos y
agitando incienso por todos lados
sería un desastre
quiero que te imagines
esto un poco más
como si fuera
el señor de los anillos
¡señor
vete
está aquí señor
¿dónde
aquí en la taberna
trae mi abrigo
su verdadero nombre era nicolás
era un buen cristiano
era el obispo de mira
una ciudad en turquía
heredó una gran suma de dinero
cuando sus padres murieron
y se volvió famoso por
su bondad con los pobres
y los generosos regalos
que les daba a los niños
él estuvo presente en
la asamblea de nicea
en el año 325 uno de los eventos
más importantes en la
historia de la iglesia
porque una de las doctrinas más
importantes de la fe cristiana
estaba siendo disputada
había líderes en la iglesia
que empezaban a negar
el poder de cristo
el evangelio que declaraba
a jesús como el hijo de dios
dios en carne y hueso
nicolás no fue amable con
aquellos que intentaron
reducir a jesús a un simple hombre
el concilio de nicea
termino produciendo
lo que se conoce hoy en
día como el credo niceno
una profesión de fe usada por iglesias
alrededor de todo el mundo
el credo afirmaba
la divinidad de cristo
y las tres personas de la trinidad
pero esa afirmación
no ocurrió sin nicolás
y una pelea
era un verdadero hombre
que luchó por una verdad
contra un verdadero enemigo de la fe
liderando toda esta herejía
había un obispo llamado arrio
era conocido como un orador
carismático y convincente
que viajaba de región en
región propaganda su herejía
como una plaga
diciendo que jesús era menos que dios
nicolás ya había oído suficiente
de las habladurías de arrio
y él sería el pastor que
protegería a sus ovejas
de los lobos
en los inicios
era la palabra
y la palabra
estaba con dios
y la palabra
era dios
los registros oficiales dicen
que en un momento crítico
durante el congreso nicolás
avergonzó a arrio no
sólo con sus palabras
sino también con sus acciones
golpeándolo
por supuesto no todos en el congreso
estuvieron contentos con sus acciones
de hecho estaban tan molestos
que le retiraron su título de obispo
pero fue tan querido por la gente
que se lo devolvieron
de hecho hasta fue
santificado por eso lo llamamos
san nicolás
esos fueron tiempos
difíciles y desesperados
la verdad estaba en juego
no era el momento de guardar
silencio y no defender la verdad
o quedar callado
sólo para estar políticamente correcto
nicolás fue un héroe
que se volvió legendario
y esa leyenda se hizo
más grande que la vida
y alcanzó fama en muchos lugares
en francia fue llamado píre noel
en suecia era tomten
en noruega era julenissen
en holanda era sinterklaas
todos lo querían
miren quién es
¿estás mejor ¿lo hiciste
vamos tenemos trabajo que hacer
vamos
vayamos esta noche a bendecir niños
tenemos regalos que dar
así que christian el tipo que tú crees
que está distrayendo toda la atención
del nacimiento del niño jesús
de hecho es el defensor de
la fe que tú quieres ser
santa
¡es el mejor
si lo es
amigo déjame decirte esto
sé que amas a mi hermana
sé que amas a cristo
sé que amas la navidad
y que querías saber de qué se trataba
pero todo esto es bueno
todo esto es de lo que se trata
sólo tienes que verlo
con una nueva visión
me lo perdí
definitivamente
me lo perdí
amigo soy
soy ese tipo de la historia
soy el patán
amigo esto es malo esto es malo
soy ese tipo
amigo me quedaré en
este auto toda la noche
esto es horrible
regresa y diles que a christian
le dio una intoxicación
o que algo me cayó mal
que me dio algo por el ponche
algo que no tenía idea que me daría
que no podía
una reacción al ponche
que me dio algo sí
¡si
y que me tuve que ir
que me tuve que ir a
tratar por el ponche
¿qué te dan por eso ¿una inyección
no
hay una mejor manera
de terminar la historia
¿sabes qué necesitas hacer
tienes que ser el tipo
que regresa a su casa
miras a tu esposa
y dice
estaba equivocado
lo arruiné
tú sabes lo que tienes que hacer
¿y si tú hicieras eso
no tengo que hacerlo yo
o tú es tu hermana no lo haré yo
es tu esposa
soy yo
soy yo
el mejor final para esta historia
es que tú seas el héroe
que todos quieren que seas
tú serás quien salva la navidad
tú serás quien
la disfruta
seré ese tipo
seré ese tipo
yo seré ese tipo
yo seré ese tipo
¡yo seré ese tipo
adelante hermano
¡yo seré ese tipo
¡yo seré ese tipo
¡yo seré
¡yo seré ese tipo
¡yo seré ese tipo
¡yo seré ese tipo
¿qué hay nena ¡yo seré ese tipo
¿qué pasa ¡yo seré ese tipo
¡yo seré ese tipo
¡cielos
¡parece que alguien
está teniendo su momento
asume toda toda la
gloria de la navidad
ahora ve la navidad
con una nueva visión
¡todos retrocedan
¡viva el espíritu santo
¡quiero un amén ¡dije amén
¡amén
¡miren ¡gloria ¡gloria
a veces tienes que
agacharte para ser humilde
como un niño
para tener la perspectiva
correcta de la navidad
mira los regalos alrededor de tu árbol
cuando los ves desde esta perspectiva
puedes ver cómo parecen
los edificios de una ciudad
imagina la nueva jerusalén
una ciudad celestial cuyo
constructor y arquitecto
es dios
y la muralla de la ciudad está adornada
con todo tipo de piedras preciosas
¿y qué hay en el centro de esa ciudad
un árbol
el árbol de la vida
disponible a través de la
sangre redentora de jesús
para todos aquellos que creen
este árbol lleno de hojas sanadoras
este árbol lleno de frutos
este árbol lleno de luces
que brillan en la oscuridad
luces que brillan sobre la ciudad
así que mira las luces
las estrellas sobre belén
anunciando el nacimiento
del príncipe de la paz
luces que nos recuerdan
que jesús es la luz del mundo
y que nosotros debemos
hacer brillar nuestra luz
ante los hombres
y otra cosa
vuelve a ver esos regalos
envueltos para verse hermosos
esperando a ser abiertos
esto no es mala administración
esto es hacer lo que dios hace
él siempre le está
dando regalos a sus hijos
en la base de los árboles
abraham recibió un hijo en
el roble de los recuerdos
los cedros de líbano fueron material
para el templo de salomón
nuestra salvación nos fue
dada en la base de un árbol
¿así que tienes este
árbol en tu casa
¿debería estar lleno de
frutos luces y regalos
¡cuidado
y ahora que saben quién
es el verdadero santa
les tengo una pregunta
¿quieren tomarse una fotografía con él
nuestras tradiciones navideñas
son tan ricas y tan plenas
si nos damos la
oportunidad de apreciarlas
es hora de salir del auto
del lugar tranquilo y seguro
donde nos hemos estado ocultando
es hora de decirle a todos
que cada centímetro
de esta creación le pertenece a jesús
ya saliste del auto
¿están bien abiertos tus ojos
¿qué ves
¿un soldado
tenemos que crear tradiciones propias
tenemos que fusionar viejos símbolos
con significados nuevos
tenemos que reordenar
nuestras vidas y hogares
para que cada cosa apunte a jesús
tenemos que contarles nuevas
historias a nuestros hijos
tenemos que ser valientes
¿recuerdan esos soldados
en el nacimiento
eran los guerreros
más fuertes de herodes
cometiendo atrocidades
cada soldado de juguete
puede ser un recordatorio
de la historia completa
de cómo la vida de un bebé fue perdonada
para convertirse en el guerrero
que se asegura que la muerte
finalmente fuera vencida
así que mantén cerca a los soldados
permite que estén
cerca del nacimiento
y recuérdale a tus hijos
que cada personaje
en la historia de dios tiene un lugar
y si tú eras como aquel tipo que
pasaba las fiestas
aterrorizando a tu familia
y amigos quejándote sobre santa
frustrando a tu esposa
es hora de hacer las cosas bien
la navidad después de todo se trata
de hacer el bien
¿estás bien
cariño he sido un patán
esta temporada navideña
si lo has sido
te mereces algo mucho mejor
y esta navidad quiero darte algo
que he querido darte hace tanto tiempo
¿qué tienes en mente guapo
¿qué pasa en la mayoría de
las historias en esta escena
quiero decir si ustedes
la estuvieran escribiendo
¿qué quisieran que pasara
el clásico beso ¿cierto
pero si aprendimos algo de todo esto
no olvidemos que a veces nuestros héroes
hacen lo inesperado
quiero organizar un baile hip hop
que refleje toda la alegría
y emoción del evangelio
que yo sólo no puedo expresar
hablo en serio
¡tócala d andré
amigo tengo justo la canción para ti
¿qué tal un poco de fuerza familiar
ángeles que oímos en las alturas
vamos amigos hagámoslo
¡sí quiero ver un coro aquí
¡vamos escuadrón de dios
ustedes saben cómo se hace
¡todos están aquí háganlo a la antigua
¡ya saben cómo se hace
¿listos ¡hagámoslo
ángeles que oímos en las alturas
cantando dulcemente en su vuelo
y las montañas en respuesta
cantan con gran felicidad
glo
gloria
en lo más alto
glo

pastores ¿por qué este júbilo
¿por qué cantan con tanta alegría
¿cuáles serán esas felices noticias
que inspiran su canción celestial

vengan a belén a verlo
al niño cuyo nacimiento

¡bien ahora todos
vamos por ese banquete

bueno por eso vengo a estas fiestas
esto es navidad
pongan su mejor vajilla
su mejor mantelería
sus mejores cubiertos de plata
el jamón más grande
y todo platillo que puedan imaginar
y la mantequilla más rica
es época de darse un festín
inviten a sus vecinos a sus colegas
a sus amigos y a su familia
y disfruten al máximo la navidad
llenen su mesa de risas
e historias y canciones
no pierdan ninguna oportunidad
para transmitir la
dicha de la temporada
y no se quejen del
materialismo durante la navidad
por supuesto no saturen
sus tarjetas de crédito
o utilicen regalos para comprar amigos
recuerden
ésta es una celebración al dios eterno
que tomó un cuerpo terrenal
así que está bien que la festividad
esté marcada con cosas materiales
cosas que podemos ver con nuestros ojos
y tocar con nuestras manos y apreciar
listones decoración
chocolate caliente
luces regalos jamón gigante
estofado caramelos
tarjetas navideñas y
más chocolate caliente
cubierto de crema
¿cómo podemos capturar
todas las navidades
podemos comer hasta reventar
podemos sonreír hasta que
nos duelan las mejillas
y reír hasta que nos duela el estómago
podemos cantar hasta perder la voz
y aun así no lograríamos
percibir la grandeza
de este glorioso día
abran sus puertas
e inviten al mundo a la historia
de este rey y su reina
esta es nuestra historia
nuestra ciudad
nuestro árbol
nuestras luces nuestros regalos
nuestras canciones nuestro san nicolás
nuestra esperanza nuestro futuro
nuestro salvador
y mi cuñado lo vio por primera vez
y una vez que has abierto los ojos
no hay vuelta atrás
todo lo mejor para ustedes
y sus familias en esta navidad
tengo que decir
las cosas han mejorado por aquí

so you can look at porn
whoa it is not my fault the
server crashes every time
i try and download
your sex tape
youre going to die
lira
children could you
come back to the table
all of a sudden came the thunder
of hooves rushing up the path
a dark figure in
a black cloak
rode it horse
toward the porch
the old man walked
down the front stairs
and the cloaked figure stopped
his horse just outside
the pool of light
that was being cast
by the lanterns
hung above the porch
the old man staggered back
shot twice once in the neck
and the other in his chest
the dark figure rose
up onto his horse
and fled down the lane
disappearing into the night
friends rushed to
the old man aid
but it was already too late
the first shot had bored
a quarter sized hole
now your chance
to a chamber--
what the hell are
you talking about
chicks get super turned
on when theyre scared
like you would know
trust me
both times i scored the chick
was either drunk or scared
i think one of the
times she was both
alright
hey hey zac
just in case
thanks tedi
do you guys mind
no
sorry it was just getting
really good dale
please continue
thanks
now as i was saying
so much blood
poured from the old man
wounds that a thick pool
formed underneath his head
he coughed once
and then again
the second being
a hideous gurgling
sound as though
two invisible hands
were choking the old
man to death
squeezing the very
life out of him
the sound sent a shiver
up the spines of everyone
who heard the old man
last dying breath
hey
dale ghost story
getting to you
oh yeah
im going to have
nightmares for weeks
here
i brought you some pinot
trying to get me liquored up
maybe
is it working
maybe
this is really good
compliments of mr sau
you know i was a little
taken back by him joining us
on our little retreat
here but um
now im starting to think it
might have its benefits
having a rich boyfriend
does have its advantages
are you sure
i wouldnt know
im a two buck
chuck type of girl
you okay
yeah
im all right
no
there something wrong
i see it in your eyes
oh
you can read my
eyes now can you
yeah i can
i bet you cant even tell
me what color they are
well
* she got eyes of
the bluest skies *
* as if they
thought of rain *
**and id hate to
look into those eyes *
* and see an
ounce of pain *
they are brown
i know im just
messing with you
and you stole that
from axl rose
how do you know he
didnt steal that from me
because youre
not that sensitive
i am sensitive dammit
as if axl rose is
mr sensitivity
hey im sure he a nice
guy once you get to know him
that like saying
he an asshole
but youll get to used to it
no it not
he once threw a girl
down a flight of stairs
well im sure he
had good reason to
yeah he did
because she wouldnt
sleep with him
that will do it
that is not funny
that is--
why why are you laughing
i am not laughing
i see that
damn you zac
why do you always have
this messed up way
of making me feel better
i dont know how you do it
are you going to tell me
what wrong
rita not back yet
are you sure
i thought she was just avoiding dale tale of the occult in there
im pretty sure zac
she been gone all day
have you told dale
no
i didnt want to spoil his fun
a whole hell of a lot of fun
should we go back in
if we have to
from that day on the servants
couldnt keep the porch clean
every few weeks a
damp pool of blood
would appear in the same spot
where the old man had died
they tried repainting
the porch several times
but the blood stain would
always bleed through
one night one of the
servants saw something
that caused him to go mad
folks said that the
house was haunted
by the angry spirit
of the old man
the house was sold
several times
but each time the
residents were driven out
by the horrible gasping
breaths of the old man ghost
and the hideous blood stain
that could never be removed
the house was eventually
abandoned until just last year
one year ago today in fact
when it was completely remodeled
and turned into tearlon lodge
youre so full of it dale
i had you going
i dont know i thought
the story was pretty good
up until the end because i
think i heard that one before
yeah

youve got to give
partial credit to joel

big misunderstanding
investigators baffled by
brutal crime at a private
psychiatric hospital in the
mountains near tearlon lake
a female patient age nine whose
name cannot be disclosed
was allegedly attacked and brutally mutilated by a male patient
of the same age
according to the police report
most of the girl tongue
had been cut out
with a pair of
surgical scissors
registered sex offender
earl ray warren
who had been working as an
orderly at the tearlon lake
psychiatric hospital
was brought in
for questioning after
investigators discovered
shocking evidence of torture
deprivation and child abuse
renowned psychiatrist
dr herman rexif
has resigned as head
physician of the hospital
and has refused to
answer any questions
no charges have been
filed at this time
earl ray warren was
released from police custody
yesterday after the conclusion
of the month-long investigation
authorities could not produce
any evidence of wrongdoing
although warren age 46
admitted to many bizarre
and cruel methods of negative
reinforcement in the care
and treatment of children
including a chamber
known only as the box
a tiny metal cell where children
were placed in isolation
sometimes for days at a time
it was done only on the direct orders of the trained medical staff
so whatd you do today
colored
is this what you drew

﻿
what
a date with a woman in that
village a long time ago
i was cute
be careful i think you ’re an insider
shoot if you shoot
are you still in the village
probably
what
can not understand
separate the hands and check the tent and truck
i watch the surroundings
youre the dead body
all right
who
are you serious
to there
sit down
this woman
why in the tent
what is she
dont go down
what is that woman
the prisoner in the tent
i got my finger cut off
why dont you kill me
it a civilian
3 people look around
right now
clerk
what is your mission
stop
what is our mission  a simple question
kill all the humans in the enemy camp
collect the materials
this woman was also in the enemy camp
yeah but she
shoot and kill
pull out the gun and shoot this woman
i feel responsible for my brother death
but she irrelevant
shoot as i was told
command is absolute
there is someone over there
how many enemies are there
apparently there are at most 3-4 people
ask walker for rescue
roger that
it ’s a fierce shootout that calls for rescue right away
this one too
it is a strategy change
gather in a helicopter
rescue does not come
youre a lie
come on
hurry up
fucking bastard
we are the same
<the order is absolute>
let go
ill run away
over here
what
nothing apart
if you have something to say
nothing
really
what did you say
to whom
that prisoner woman
kia spoke
what story
dont go down
is it your mama
stop
<dont go down>
wait lie
there are stairs
let go quickly there is quite a lot to the top floor
fine
i forgot about the past
i cant forget
dont worry it true
is it just me  it doesnt arrive even if it goes up
are you okay
i wait here
no good
i have a bad feeling
me too
are you all okay
are you all safe
it settled
look at someone
i go
no
calm down
power problems
buxton
buxton
shit what
no good
dont go down
run
go up
is that no good either
wireless communication
what happening
god work
god is trying
dont say silly
she is right
when did you become pious
because of my first mission when i was 9 years old
if you were escorting the prisoners ---
surrounded by convoys by the rebels
i was caught with the prisoners too
it took 5 months to escape
behind their hideout ––
there was a clock tower with a long staircase
they are every day
everything was scattered on the stairs
like broken glass or safety pins
we took off our shoes
walked on it
repeat over and over again
all day long
i was told that i was a soul judge
so no doubt
this is punishment
what
kill the prisoners
dont talk silly
thinking about the current situation
there will be danger every few minutes
i have to run away
first ill find the exit
dont talk useless
that an order
let go up
i feel like im climbing the same stairs all the time
even if you reach the top
it looks like im back down
there is an exit
hold the gun
with an enemy
already one person was killed
what is this
no way now
stop it no
impossible
that right
after all it may be punishment
i can not do it
go down
dont say stupid
what should i do
i do not understand
but below is dangerous
why do you know it is dangerous
i feel
im sorry ---
believe in god better than you
stop it ryan
certainly i swore loyalty
but it ’s not going to hell
this song again
my mother sang when i couldnt sleep
i cant sleep
it a creepy song
what will you do
let go up
until when
eternally
thought to me
try talking
you should run away before that
let go
so what
im just beginning to see
are you going to hell soon
ford is noisy
mostly about prisoners
the date and place of detention are written
that woman is from calcars
it seems like i was restrained for a long time
aside from that
the instruction do not kill her
her synonym is also listed
what
the prophet of death
local superstition
i think you can understand it without explaining
this situation is obviously related to her death
what  kia
is it my fault
i apologize
if you say too much
ill kill you
stop stanton
shut up garrett
everyone set the clock
nolan and walker watch over the door
everything else is reconnaissance
reconnaissance
do you get it
same as usual training
it a situation that doesnt make sense
there no need to stay on the stairs
let find a solution
ford comes with me
what
can not understand
what if you dont come back
walker
listening
what wrong
dont come
emma
lower the gun
please drop the gun early
listen to the story  lower the gun
walker
come to help
please
walker
what about walker
i have to go
<dont go down>
need a strategy
this is different from training
i know
really
what is it then
obviously supernatural power is working
that power seems to want to stop our actions in the past
i want to save the prisoners
what will you do
do nothing
eh
wait i dont understand what you mean
do nothing
i should have decided to die when i took on the mission
once on the battlefield every danger awaits
will this is not the battlefield
no it ’s the battlefield
my mission was to kill people in
the enemy camp and collect information
mission completed
if you are destined to die here
that kind of contract
dan death was a disaster
but dont drag too much
your judgment will slow down
my brother death is my responsibility
prioritized emotions over missions
either way my brother may have died
but even now every time i close my eyes
the moment my brother died crosses my head
i just regret
younger brother wasted
for something big
we are disposable pieces anyway
just follow the instructions
i understand your feelings
can nolan go first
i have a leg injury so it takes time to walk
go
harris stop it
ill kill you
that probably right
this fucking guy
wake up
stop it already
ill go
standing
i cant
go
dont be stupid stand up
save the prisoners
correct the past--
the future should change
no i cant leave
let go
who else has limited legs
dont pick your finger within 24 hours
really angry
it ’s torture as walker says
let me rest a little
i ’ve been out twice
i returned to the same past both times
do you remember where you were at that time
i divided myself and watched around
attack from the left
so run to the right and in front of the tent
how can clark avoid killing prisoners
just tell the past about the circumstances
what if a man just like you suddenly appears
ill kill you
exactly
you dont have to touch yourself in the past
our ambush fails if we inform the enemy
what if the enemy killed me
come on
it ’s like “back to the future”
i like the third work
ignore the present
i cant think of another good strategy
if you scare your enemies they may escape from there
what are you waiting for
if nobody is gone let go home
i think it impossible
unbearable for a long time on
the battlefield without supplies and rescue
am i left
there are no exceptions for everyone
no
just drive them away
separate the hands and check the tent and truck
i watch the surroundings
youre the dead body
who
this woman
what are you doing
i confirmed my finger
why does my finger return
something might have changed
what is that woman
nothing has changed
clerk
what is your mission
stop
what is our mission  a simple question
it time already
what is your strategy
not particularly
shoot stanton
no all will survive
is that possible
command is absolute
i have to go back to the door
if you start running you will be shot
but i have to go
shoot the ground only once
someone is over there
go
my legs are dangerous
im worse
ill try again
now let go back and help the prisoners
there is time between when an enemy soldier gets up and when he attacks
let enter a tent while attracting with a gunshot
i
nolan is impossible and two people
lack in preparation and training
shut up and leave it to me
what if i cant make it
that right
wait until you return
now
my back was shot
may breathe
<all right>
what is that woman
the prisoner in the tent
i got my finger cut off
why dont you kill me
what is your strategy
same as before
help ford after driving away with a gun
command is absolute
there is someone over there
stop it
nolan and the two of us go back together
how many enemies are there
apparently there are at most 3-4 people
ford standing
look
ill go
how about two people
hurry up  let go
die if you dont pick up bullets
i have to stop bleeding
bite this
believe
sorry
hang in there
finished
i wont hold it for a long time unless i see a doctor
what is your strategy
there
ford firmly
otherwise ill die
this strategy does not work
shut up
he right
then another good idea
if you reach the helicopter
escape from here and help ford
if we die on the battlefield in the past we will disappear
no abnormalities
fine
pitiful guys
let stop him
still not possible now
<the order is absolute>
which one
im back again
thought to fail
noisy
stop  are you listening
damn it
let move
ill regret it if i take it off
right
but ill take it off
now try a different method
<what  〉
<can not understand>
what is that woman
the prisoner in the tent
i got my finger cut off
nolan
two people look around
right now
pull out the gun and shoot this woman
shoot as i was told
ive besieged release the prisoners
you can negotiate with this
who are you
if you dont release the prisoners youll kill all
it ’s a lie to be surrounded
if it ’s true i ’m already dead
do you get it
so what is your request
release the prisoners and leave
then dont kill
unfortunately
command is absolute
quickly
i dont know how long i will hold
good luck
for what
to challenge
the prisoners were destined to die
im sure we too
it the worst
maybe already dead
you must have thought about it once
i said walker was torture
here is hell
<what  〉
<can not understand>
someone is over there
why dont you kill me
it a civilian
ill stop
i cant stop it
is that so
two people go
you can get out of here if you save the prisoners
this hell never ends
absolutely
ill finish
where did you do it
i was in the enemy
i brought it
now i know why
nolan may be right
i wont die
the worst strategy
right
im sure there is another way
forget
to the container
save them if possible
join the helicopter
it ’s going to be a battle
i want to help as many people as possible
what is that woman
pull out the gun and shoot this woman
shoot as i was told
someone is over there
what are the materials
is that all
i dont know
kill all the enemies
<fine>
<i will help>
<standing>
<firmly>
what are you doing
lower the gun
first aid and return to duty
the important thing is to act correctly
rather than command
now i know
it will be the worst ending
doesnt work
do not remove
i wont remove it
come with me
good
it is a strategy change
gather in a helicopter
<the order is absolute>
it all right now
do not worry
should be fine
who are you
save the civilian command
it not a taxi
begging because it okay
there are others wait a moment
wait only 2 minutes
it was safe
can i rent a car
do whatever you want
lost sight of
what about stanton
im dead
why is that woman
new order take her with you
watch your fingers
what are you doing  let go early
kia what are you doing
go
you heard  go
the traitor
kia
you are expelled from the unit
why such a manet
the instruction was wrong
keep silent
stanton  this fucking guy
quickly
where are you
radio returned
is the civilian safe
everyone is on a helicopter
go already
i cant go
back to help
no
go
command
okay good luck
did you correct the mistake
yeah
if there is a way to stop the battle
the battle never ends
so be
very cold
right
do you remember the song that mom sang
i was saved by that song
what is the headquarters
speak honestly
stanton shot clark
i unavoidably shot him
no materials found rescued civilian pow
wait lie
there are stairs
let go quickly there is quite
a lot to the top floor

im going to be in sydney
for the launch
that right old chum
im on  starflight
ill be in australia
a good two hours
before you launch
the satellite out there
how everything
at your end
hey pretty good mate
listen everything looks
pretty good down here
some small delays
but safety check starting
in about an hour
we get
that communications
satellite up there
and the sky the limit
ive already got bids
on two-thirds of
the telecommunications pods
more to come
hey listen freddie
what this i hear
about the chinese
well theyve got a right
to talk to the world too
dont they
what are they
gonna do
beam down
fortune cookies laughs
laughing
nope i dont know
which is the bigger
news event
starflight
or freddie baron
incorporated
am i crazy
not so i noticed
im a scientist
im supposed to
deal in specifics
and im being spooked
by a feeling
the rockets again
the rockets again
josh you told me
that the only one
who could handle them
was cody briggs
sighing
he the best there is
but he is no match
for a computer
now am i
being difficult
no youre being josh
i mean the computers
dont show any no-nos
the tests were fine
everything was
you look wonderful
you ought to sleep
in a gray suit
sighs
thornwell
hello doppler
good day to you
mr thornwell
mr bowdish said
to tell you
he waiting for you
thank youand congratulations sir
to all of us
elliot is there anything
to josh fuss
about postponement
oh no it
it too remote
youd better show me
starflightis an airplane
it not a spaceship
it was designed to operate
in a gravity field
take a look at this
see before the booster
rockets are cut off
that thing is
moving at better than
half a mile a second
straight out
towards space
what josh is worried about
is a possibility of a slip
that could
lift  starflightright out
of the atmosphere
and you and i know
that cant happen
yeah but supposing
it does
what does that do
in terms of
cabin pressure
well youd have
a pressurized craft
pushing against
the nothingness
of a zero atmosphere
so if there
any structural flaw
beeping
man over pa
starflight one  is two hours
from liftoff and counting
woman over pa
other cabins have
been outfitted
for the news teams
that have formed
an international crew
to cover this event
starflight  is operated
through a complicated network
of computer banks
it took two years
to program the software
for these computers
your father
would like you
on his far right
so what new
chuckles
josh come on
you almost missed
your own flight
chuckles
mr thornwellthat right
okay shake hands again
very nice
i understand youre
having a few
well we wont
call them troubles
but some qualms
well uh
josh you give me
one shred of evidence
that this magnificent plane
of yours is not ready
to take off
and ill cancel
the flight
smile josh
i would prefer it
if the rockets
were under
ground control yes
but she is ready
for her maiden flight
isnt she
well uh
now will the two
mr thornwells
come with me
what if he wouldve
said no flight
then mr joshua gilliam
would have missed the plane
excuse me just a moment
ill be right back
joe
dad you remember
joe pedowski
headed up our
electric systems
oh yes of course
you won the employees
drawing didnt you

cody over pa

if some of you
are thinking i ought to
be minding the store
and not yakking
with you
youre right and i am
this is a taped message
felix jean-pierreyeah felix

laughingspeaking french
cody over pa
well be traveling
at that speed
for one hour
and 50 minutes
whenstarflight one
will touch down
across the world
in sydney australia
dings
that all there is to it
ladies and gentlemen
millie and andrea will
be coming around
to see if you are
thirsty or hungry
but i suggest
that you imbibe quickly
because youll soon be
overrun by news people

and live reports
not only to the united states
and australiagood luck
but just about
every other country
in the world
this should help
you may have to
bring the whole bottle
laughs
you too huh
nope airplanes
dont bother me
chris wait up
there been
a delta launch
from australia
angle of ascent
45 degrees
any problems
were still tracking
but it could come close
to the hst flight plan
chattering
were tracking
a delta launch that
didnt clear with us
she moving in an arc
that characteristic of
a second stage malfunction
now if she malfunctions
there no telling
what course shell take
where the feed
from nasa
some kook got
a delta rocket
moving toward us
starflightto ground
bowdish over radio
go ahead cody
wed like permission
to let nasa
take us through this
that affirmative cody
okay
nasa were all yours
were watching you
like a hawk  starflight
now when we took off
here los angeles
it may have felt to you
as if we were going
straight up
well we were
just like a missile
and that because
this craft is powered
by rockets
we use that rocket power
to attain an altitude
of 00000 feet
at which point
we were going
at a speed of
approximately four
mach 4
that about
2500 miles per hour
there gotta be
something you can do
there not
a bloody thing i can do
the automatic
sequence control
didnt complete
the third stage rockets
arent firing mate
but youve got to
give it every chance
dont let them
blow it
dont please
bud  safety ground command
is turning purple
bud dont let
them destruct it
look mate
we dont have
a bloody third stage
bud you destruct it
and im going to
lose everything
i mean everything
we dont have any choice
freddie
youve got to
stop them somehow
stop em
bud destruct the rocket
explosion
she gone
yeah well
their timing stinks
starflight
the missile
been destroyed
cody over radio  what does
that mean for us
a million pieces
of space junk
headed towards you
at 8000 miles an hour
how close
at your speed
everything close
im out of
my element chris
what my move
chris  we cant
pin the debris
not sure you can manage
lateral traffic avoidance
give me my move chris
starflight
pull up and climb
at your best rate
that means the rockets
in preparation for landing
in sydney
over pa
ladies and gentlemen
this is captain briggs
please return
to your seats immediately
and fasten
your seat belts
it couldnt be weather
at this altitude could it
all right del hit it
cody over radio
were at 45000
you should be over debris
in five seconds
joehmm
what going on man
i dont know
chris over radio
stand by to level off
and return to 20000
standing by
okay  starflight
level off
standby to leveled off
kill rockets
rockets are still burning
beeping
we mustve
taken a hit
rocket control wiring
cody over radio
thornwell ground
this isstarflight one
we think weve
taken a hit
weve lost all controls
to rocket thrust
we cannot
kill the burn over
cody weve got you
at 60000 and climbing
over
cody  how long
until the rockets
burn out on their own
two minutes
and four seconds
were an airplane
not a space ship
you know where
thatll push us
yeah straight up through
the atmospheric lid
450000 feet
into space
kill the burn cody
kill the burn
340000 and climbing
bowdish this is  starflight
how much time to burnout
twenty-four seconds
when do they hit space
450000 feet
cody  380000
del 43000
how long to bum out
fifteen seconds
me might make it
rumbling
how much time
bowdish
seven seconds
four three
bowdish  one burnout
were in orbit
eighty-seven miles up
end of ride
ladies and gentlemen
this is your captain
we are not in
any immediate danger
we are all weightless
so until we get some
more information
please stay
in your seats
with belts fastened
kind of get
everything loose
fastened down
well appreciate it
thank you
will josh gilliam
and erica hansen
please come
to the flight deck
you all right
yeahlet go
grab on
beeping
cody  thornwell ground
this isstarflight one
we have made
a preliminary check
there are no injuries
fifty-nine of us
are alive and well
waiting for
your instructions
where the hell
did everybody go
cody this is bowdish
you realize that uh
that plane was
not designed to
go into orbit
so we dont have
that information
in the computer
and were going to
need some think time
over radio  briggs
chris lucas at nasa
first directive calls for you
to save electrical power
no hot coffee
no microwave
and pull
the transmission plug to
that news bay of yours
does that get us home
weve got a preliminary
that gives you 50 hours
before your orbit
degenerates
and then things heat up
how our air
this is schultie cody
we should have a fix
on that for you
in a few minutes
cody you better
check the skin
on that ship
pressure looks normal
in all areas
briggs
well be tracking you
around the world
theyre talking
but theyre not
saying much
starflightout
let me see what
i can come up with
cody could you talk
to them about
the weightlessness again
if you keep them informed
they may not panic
i better get out there
right
ladies and gentlemen
this is captain briggs again
i repeat we are in
no immediate danger
the aircraft has not
been significantly damaged
the pressure
in all the cabins
is completely normal
thornwell ground control
and nasa
are already
initiating procedures
that will get us
back on course
were assured of nasa
complete cooperation
electricity crackling
in the meantime
if youd kind of
get everything loose
fastened down
wed appreciate it
thank you
this is for the news bay
in order
to save battery power
were suspending live
transmission facilities
to earth
well they pulled the plug
but that doesnt stop us
using our battery pack
why dont you guys
set up over in there
cameraman
godspeed boss
this is felix duncan
aboard  starflight one
in orbit
in a weightless environment
aboard a ship that
was not designed
for space flight
we are circling the earth
once every 90 minutes
for all intents and purposes
this is an aircraft that
has already crashed
well theyve got
at least 48 hours
before an
uncontrolled reentry
what have they got
on the outside
sixty
sixty
they have 60 hours
of oxygen left
that borderline
borderline
what are you saying
im saying
it borderline
there not enough oxygen
for that many people
for that long a period
of time
do i have to
spell it out for you
the only way were going
to get that thing down here
is to reactivate
the booster rockets
but the controls
are locked
all the fuel was
used up on the burn
i know that
and chris lucas of nasa
is doing
a feasibility study
on having
the space shuttle columbia
replenish the fuel
she going to
need a heat shield
to reenter
the atmosphere
im working on that
okay
excuse me
refuel the rockets
lucas youre crazier
than i am
what have you got
a tank full
of liquid hydrogen
stashed up here
chris it columbia briggs
shell be making
the delivery
her crew will
refill your tank with
the liquid hydrogen
were getting ready
to the send
the space shuttle
columbia up to you
right now
our best team is
at canaveral
it chief honcho
is captain kenny herrera
hell pilot the ship
thank god
weve learned how
to get them up fast
liftoff will be
in two hours
give it a shot
del check the cargo bays
see that everything
is still secured
were orbit plus 45
weve just gone halfway
around the world
door opens
del ive finished
the inspection
we have a damaged strut
in b cargo hold
seal going
if we close her off
we lose that much air
b cargo
that at least 0%
we lose four or five hours
even if columbia
does find us
how do we get back
without a heat shield
we dont
rocket liftoff
we got liftoff
columbia on its way up
to youstarflight
columbia to houston
we have target in sight
chuckles
is that ever
beautiful
oh boy
shall we do it
linda over radio
ready to refuel them
starflight
when were ready to feed
you release
the number three
fuel hatch
we copy
captain briggs
im ready to feed
that affirmative
linda  ready
captain herrera
start pumping
fueling completed
captain briggs
closing hatch
returning to columbia
could you take a look
at our rocket bay
we may have sustained
some damage
crackling
linda  captain briggs
you were right
your external
rocket system
control line is split
how long to
make the splices
sir this is a maze
im looking at
ill consult
with captain herrera
for now id cut
the power feed
to this line
captain briggs
we copy
if we could find
another configuration
a different angle
to reduce friction
to a minimum
we just might be able
to affect reentry
i mean
shed heat up
but she might
come through
then figure it out
sighs well we cant
what about nasa
nasa would need
the performance
characteristics
of the design
and theyre just not
in the computer
you see we ordered josh
not to put them
in the computer
internal security
i mean weve never
had a conventional aircraft
in a reentry mode before
90% of this maneuver
depends on the instincts
of the person
who designed the system
and that josh
columbia carries
an airlock
they could get him
and bring him back
it seems ironic
you two planning a way
to bring josh home
when if you had just
listened to him
in the first place
cody we think we can
jury-rig our airlock
to fit over
your sectioned-off
equipment compartment
therell be
spacesuits inside
well be bringing
the airlock over
to pick up josh gilliam
at nasa request
we copy
i guess we better
make sure it works
before we risk
josh gilliam
im the only one here
who wrote on
his school application
that he wanted
to be an astronaut
oh listen petecase closed
captain you better speak
to josh
all right pete
clanking
cody were here
all right ill patch
you over to ray
on phone  pete
this is ray barstow
the guy in
a funny white suit
you hear me okay
affirmative
on voice cue youll open
your compartment hatch
enter the airlock
then you close
starflight  hatch
linda  ready pete
pete  yeah
sorry all the great
space walk lines have
already been used
see you soon
all right ill secure
the compartment
have a good trip
ill catch the next one
piece of cake
linda  open the
compartment hatch
beeping
im in the airlock
about to suit up
ray  get the suit
and helmet on as quick
as possible pete
let us know
when youve got
the suit on
pete  im going
as fast as i can
your funny white suit
all right
i always wanted one
ray  yup it goes
with anything
make sure you shut
the airlock hatch pete
rattling
ray  pete
is your hatch shut
rattling
screaming
pete im so sorry
no more guinea pigs
there got to be
another way to
get you off
all right
but this time
it just me
no more guinea pigs
our transmission frequencies
are being monitored
the whole world
knows about pete
i think you have to
let people see that
were still all right
return power
to press bay
crackling
starflighthas
about 39 hours
of oxygen left
unless their orbit
breaks down
and they reenter
before then
damned if i can
figure this out
josh is the guy
to get everyone down
we got to figure a way
to get him down
schultie give me
a reading on that
oxygen clock will you
thirty-six hours
4 minutes
reporter weve got
the pilot wife
that janet briggs
grab your gear
have you been in contact
with your husband
no i havent
im sorry
when did you first hear
about the disaster
excuse me
i have got to
do you have
any children
im sorry im sorry
im janet briggs
can you let me throughhow does it feel
to have a world famous
husband in orbitplease
this information will
only help you
to tell the public
reporters clamoringplease i cant see
with that light
will you please
let me through
how are you
im okay
i appreciate you
you know
always did
it just seems easier
to tell you now
janet showed up
at ground control
i wouldve
expected that
didnt you
i guess
every 45 minutes
turn the lights on
turn em offswitch clicking
it the only entertainment
on this $50 million
flying coffin
this is not our coffin
we are going
to get back
cody wont we
lucas cody here yeah cody
chris if some kind of
air tight container
could be rigged
inside the luggage bay
could it be used
to transfer someone
that affirmative briggs
what are you thinking
erica tell josh to
pack his toothbrush
he going home
yes sir
look here how maybe
it can go down okay
the luggage compartment
is sealed off from
the rest of the ship
we load josh
into the casket
and the two astronauts
open the compartment
and pull josh to columbia
wouldnt he
need oxygen
the whole operation
will take four
to five minutes
there enough
oxygen in there
to sustain him
let suppose that thing
isnt really airtight
at best all josh
would have would be
a few cubic feet of air
and what left
in his own lungs
martin got a point
even a hairline fracture
or a pinhole
look i think josh
knows the risks
better than we do
chris over radio
houston to columbia
you still there kenny
what do you need chris
we might put you down
at thornwell in california
any problems
is that launch facility
of theirs operational
affirmative
okay as long
as we have our
own ground crew
can you handle
the ambassador wife
there no other way
look we ran out of
moral niceties
when those rockets
wouldnt turn off
if you dont believe me
go ask your passengers
how they feel about
swapping a dead man
for a chance to
get out of here alive
we dont have time
to think of another way
we just dont
ill talk
to mrs winfield
good girl
cody yeah cody here
linda and ray are
starting across to you
theyll open
the luggage bay hatch
and take delivery
of the casket
with josh in it
when you
give me the word
that a roger
were still
losing pressure
i cant figure out where
what about
b cargo hold
i checked itcheck it again
sobbing it not right
oh please
it not right
there no other way
sobbing
cody youll get your tush
frozen out there
not exactly my idea
of first class
transportation no
help help
whooshing
about four minutes worth
of air in here
shouldnt take
longer than that
you could hold your breath
for another three
if youre in shape
im not
linda  were at
the luggage bay hatch
ready to
take the casket
check the seal
sighs
no light leaks
hermetically sealed
i dont suppose theyve
ever had a consumer
complaint
let go
there a hole
the size of my fist
i didnt have
a choice cody
i sealed off
the entire cargo hold
you did right
depressurize
the luggage bay
now we lose the air
in the luggage compartment
starflighthere
starflight
you ready
my copilot decompressing
the luggage compartment now
in 30 seconds
well open the hatch
josh is halfway
to columbia now
hissing soundgasps
gasping for breath
are you all right
there was a leak
what did you do
laughs
remember the story
of the little dutch boy
and the dike
crackling
schultie over radio
were figuring
how much air you lost
look schultie
we got two compartments
sealed off
now that means lost air
which means lost time
i want
there must be millions
yup
all of it wouldnt
buy us out of this mess
starflight
this is bowdish
at control over
cody over radio
go ahead bowdish
we calculate youve lost
about nine hours
of your air supply over
roger bowdish out
youd better reset
that clock
theyve got 7 hours
and eight minutes
of oxygen left
well if josh doesnt
come up with a miracle
we can take our pick
suffocate or burn up
on reentry
thanks
man over pa
that touchdown
for columbia
back from rendezvous with
starflight one  in space
what about reentry
were projecting
2 hours
well i guess
we dont get
to choose
the air will run out
four hours sooner
than that
all chattering
give me a plane deck
rotate it
sighs
what else you got
captain our cupboards
are just about bare
you fellows got
a catering truck
you can put
some wings on
sure briggs
if you dont
mind your caviar
coming out of
a toothpaste tube
well be sending it to you
the next time we can get
columbia up
what the hell is that
sighs
elliot elliot
what is it
what does that
look like to you
whatthat
what a tunnel
the universal
docking device
could be
it could work
whatve you got
in there on it
felix  we have
just been told what
the rescue operation is
it involves
a universal docking device
built by thornwell aviation
as part of
its space program
this device
will be carried up
tostarflight
by that heroic
space traveler
the shuttle columbia
about to be launched again
from southern california
as we wait
each passenger is
surely wondering
if home and loved ones
will ever be seen again
yet there hope
and a triumph
of the human spirit up here
onstarflight one
as for
the rescue itself
the docking device
has been altered
to conform
to the hatch design
ofstarflight one
working
in tandem with nasa
well the waiting over
for you at least
you havent
lost him janet
yes i have
man over pa
ten nine eight seven
six five four
three two one zero
rumbling
columbia has liftoff
on its way
tostarflight one
cody as you know
weve got some
decisions to make
including us
there 57 survivors
columbia only has
its flight deck
quarters pressurized
they figure they can
squeeze in 20 at a time
three jumps in all
six of us as crew
will be the last
to leave
well have a drawing
on the decision
for the passengers
now these people will
be floating through
a snaking tunnel
50 miles up
getting into
the nearest thing
we have to a spaceship
and gliding
to a landing
without engines
it going
to be scary
weve got to
play it down
theyre already numb
with fear
i think some of them
are probably in shock
somebody could panic
what happens
if a piece
of space debris
pops the skin
of the tunnel
amy prepare the lists
for the drawing
passengers chattering
jack bernard
mrs edward harvey
mrs lucille hunt
frederick baron
scott mcgee
hal paressi
okay that the 20
it been decided
that you will go across
five at a time
the five will be
decided by the 20
ill need your decisions
right away
passengers chattering
del there are
the blue plate
specials you ordered
thanks
okay everybody
now youre going to
be kind of pulling
yourselves across
on a white nylon rope
inside the chute
ill go first
just follow me
dont be afraid
youll be fine
now watch your heads
man over pa  the first group
of five hasnt come out
of the tunnel yet
still waiting houston
ray okay now if
you five do as well
as the last five did
youre going to
make a hero out of me
easy we go
crackling
man over pa
that touchdown
for columbia
carrying the five
rescued passengers
fromstarflight one
josh it wasnt
your fault
that conduit
was still hot
space shuttle columbia
you got five
of them down
you can bring
the rest home
i just killed
five people
you didnt kill them
you tried to save them
ah what better
killing five at a time
or all at once
they have 2 hours
of oxygen left
you are the only chance
theyve got
dont you understand
i would need a bus to
bring them all back
then get them a bus
sighs
there is a way
we can get most
of them down anyway
culver air has
a booster tank for
their mayflower rocket
which if my figuring
is accurate
will fit almost exactly
inside columbia
cargo hold
put down that phone
put it down
now you listen to me
all three of you
that gantry out there
that orbitor
processing facility
the one that
columbia using now
that represents
$93 million
ive got to eat
cause we lost
the space shuttle
contract to culver
and i know how
they did it
industrial espionage
bowdish tell mr gilliam
about bart culver
bowdish he right josh
bart culver had
a whole network of
spies working on us
as a matter of fact
six of the key design
components were ours
those culver cutthroats
shafted me for $ billion
that was the size
of the contract we lost
mr gilliam
and now you expect me
to go crawling back
to culver
and have him
reap the praise
and the rewards
for rescuing
my hst project
are you telling me
that all those people
up there have to die
just so that bart culver
doesnt get credit
for the rescue
what the hell kind
of ajust one minute josh
you just watchall right
both of you
get out of here
josh count on
that booster tank
excuse me qt
yes get me bart culver
over at culver industries
our position changed
yeah the force
of the explosion
shifted us around
would you care to

so if you can crank up
those toys of yours

there no angle
that will work
it just cant be done
you got any better idea
ill get one
chris  houston here
weve just
got an update on your
time of reentry cody
starflightwill reenter
the earth atmosphere
in 73 minutes
captain it going

youve got to do it
in less than one
oh my god

keep it coming
come on
beeping

that a good one joe
thatll do it
it all yours now cody

all right now
put  starflightin
right behind her
okay keep her coming
come on closer
closer

all weve got to do is
find the right angle
hello houston
yeah listen
you got columbia
touching down here
in about what
forty-seven minutesforty-seven minutes
do you think
she could make another jump
with minimum processing
what for
so she can watch
the burn up
can she do it
not quick enough
by the time
she got back up
there wouldnt be
anything left
of  starflight
got anything else
hanging around
anything up
there already
hold on

sighs
come on come on
xu5 is up doing repairs
on a military satellite
can you clarify
all right now listen
you remember
when you used
to have to piggyback
your twin shuttle
to florida on a 747
im going for
the flip side of that
sorry about
the gloom before
that all right
josh just had
a brainstorm
columbia xu5 is
on her way to us
could get here
before we take the dive
if she does
well maneuver behind
her plow wave
and ride her shadow
shell be
our heat shield
yeah if we stay
close enough
and if we dont pile up
and take both ships out
codyi know
columbia not
big enough
the wing tips will burn
a little
it crazy
that it is
cody  recheck your
projected oxygen bowdish
weve got
big problems
yes we know captain
we had an upside
and a downside
in our projections
then our readings
are accurate
we cant make it
to reentry
not with nine of you using
the remaining oxygen no
look if
if there were maybe
five or six of you
look dont ever stand
where i can see you
bowdish
because if you do
ill tear you in half
so help me god
now if we mean anything
to anyone down there
then somebody will
get that damn guy out
of the control area
because i dont want
to hear his voice again

what happened
im not sure
but i think there
going to be more of them
oh rocky
thunder
looks like one of your
men stopped the target here
but couldnt finish the job
last report had them tracking
him north by northwest
then the radio went dead
let fan out
begin a hard target
search of the area
if you make contact with
the target do not engage
i repeat do not engage
i do not want this man
to escape our perimeter
you notify me and the
rest of the squad
move out
you got any more men
left alive out there
you better call em in
why
theyre just gonna
be in our way
my men are highly
skilled professionals
but if they were you
wouldnt have called me
im not going to stand
here and argue with you
good
either call them in or
suffer the consequences
what do you mean
ive turned
these wolves loose
theyre going to shoot
anything that moves out there
and ask questions later
michaels
yes sir
i need to talk to
you for a minute
look ive been given full
clearance to kill this target
but there a substantial
cash bonus in it for all of us
if we can bring him back alive
now i turn you
loose on this guy
and he doesnt stand a chance
that going to cost me money
now i need to know
can you follow orders
of course i can sir
you know i--
dont bullshit me michaels
between roth goin soft on
me and you killin everything
in sight im
starting to think i
got in the wrong line of work
now i do not want to
mess up this mission
so i need to know
can you obey orders
sir i am a soldier
i can follow orders
yeah just like you
did with kozinski
sir i apologize
for the incident ok
i had no idea the
guy was so fragile
he just kind of came apart
i overestimated his
tolerance for pain
no what you did
was underestimate
your own strength
now i do not want to
mess up this mission
so i need to know
unequivocally
can you obey orders
yeah
good
you damn well better
get the hell outta here
crying
grace
youre gonna have
to leave this place
and where will we go
we are gonna separate
theyre after me
they will kill you
why
who are these people
why would they kill me
because youve seen me
because ive seen you
what the fuck does that mean
i dont know
youve got a very
selective memory
grace it not my memory
i see things in flashes
i know i was their prisoner
but i dont know why
but if you dont
even know who they are
or why they are after
you how do you even
know there going to be more
do you want to stay here and
take the chance that im wrong
no
i dont
ok
let go
yeah that a copy
sir
yes mitchell
you know if roth
poses a problem
id be more than happy
to take care of him
i dont think that will
be necessary mitchell
besides id rather you
concentrate on the target
have i ever let you down
no you havent
in fact mitchell youve
got the three qualities
i admire most in a soldier
loyalty expertise
and thirst for blood
well now you cant be a
great fighter unless youve got
something worth fightin for
thunder

phone ringing
general gardner here
general beckett i have denton
and his crew on the case
the initial problem should
be solved within the hour
but i think this
entire incident has
exposed how precarious our
position is with this project
i think we need to make
an immediate correction
in our policy
what do you suggest
i feel we should
terminate this operation
before it gets out of control
weve got $6 billion
wrapped into your operation
there general
and now you want us
to just let everything
go right down the
drain because you lost
your handle on the situation
is that it
if we cut our losses now we
can walk away with our careers
intact
all right and what is your
suggested course of action
oh an industrial
accident of some sort
an explosion something big
wipe out the plant and
everyone and everything in it
well i will uh give
that some thought general
meanwhile do nothing
retrieve the soldier
and you wait for further
instructions understand
yes sir
he gone quite insane
youll have to intercede
how long will it take
you to get to the plant
i can take an f4 be
there before sunrise
all right
general beckett
he a patriot one
of this country great heroes
i want you to show him
the proper respect
ill handle the matter
with velvet gloves
all right
oh caulder
you know what i find most
repellent about the agency
you work for
what that sir
how easy it is for you
boys to do the hard thing
someone got to do it
dont they sir
yes
someone got to do it
roth omega to home base
omega to home base
that a copy omega
what your 20
im standing at

going to tell them
you dont even know

take this slip go to
room number three please
amina mergessa
and ahmed mergessa
welcome to the uk
is there a miss abdal
miss abdal
youre lilly abdal
follow me
this is your father
yes
youve come from ethiopia
where were you before that
morocco
how long were you there
2 years
where were you born
my father told me i was born
on a mongolian fishing boat
off the coast of botswana
but theyre
yes
two landlocked countries
i know that now
and your mother did she have
a different version
of your birth
she said they found me
under a leaf
right
someone from ethiopia
if they were to come to
england how would i know
with the sheer
volume of refugees
and the fact that
not everyone ends up
in the united kingdom
im afraid there no way
now if youll follow me
i need to go back
that impossible
the country in chaos
yes
if you step this way please
take a seat here
just wait here
hi yes
i pray your heart
will answer yes
and free me
come on darlin free me
only you
can free me from
this misery
i know that i told you a lie
come on mom
but did you have
to say good bye
without your love
i cant go on
so please dont
leave me all alone
and free me
darling darling free me
only you
can free me from
this misery
well done lilly
when i was
seven years old
my parents took me
to a sufi shrine
why are we here
to see the great abdal
they took me
there to be blessed
by a revered sufi master
the great abdal
at least that
what they told me
mom
mom mom
where are you going
were just uh
going for a ride
why arent you taking me
why dont you go back and play
with the other children
no but mom
sorry lilly
well be back
before you know it
well see you soon lilly
it took some doing
but we were able to find
a record of a daughter
born to a philip
and alice mitchel named lilly
seems they applied for
a passport for you
at the british
consulate in istanbul
they never returned
to pick it up
this card identifies
you as a british citizen
and permits you to return
home with all due rights
and privileges something
you will come to appreciate
if you have any sense at all
but that not my name
it is now
attention please
i have a short announcement
is there someone who
can translate for me
is the english girl here
ill do it
do you want me to translate into
amharic harari or oromigna
whatever you think best
very well you may proceed
the refugee referral agency
will arrange for long-term
housing at several
different council estates
as they become available
the name of anyone eligible
for immediate consideration
will be posted on a bulletin
board in the dining area
but what happens to us
if were not chosen
until your name
appears on that list
you can assume that most of you
will be here for
the foreseeable future
now if there are
no further questions
i have a question
when will she be back
she wont
when a person in authority says
and if there are no
further questions
it means they had no intention
of answering them
in the first place
i didnt know that
then you have a lot to learn
nouria
what did we expect
excuse me
im supposed to go to
the pelham garden estate
pelham is what we say
pelham
that it right there
straight ahead and turn left
youll see it
and there no garden
thank you
all right
she been circumcised
i told her
i know what you told her
you would make a good nurse
you are right
now i must ask you
some questions
i dont really know anything
you should really ask nouria
my questions are not
about the child
oh
who are you
and what in the world
are you doing in harar
is this information
required by the hospital
by me
im curious
you may have noticed you do
not look like anyone else here
yes i did
but there was supposed
to be a teacher here
i lived in harar
a muslim like you
i studied quran with the
great abdal at the shrine
to the blessed bilal al habeshi
wait
wait
were not interested
i know i know
a question please
just one moment
do you know this man
here in london
or is he still in harar
im not sure
sorry
who is this doctor to you
and when did that
become our business
just look again please
no my dear
we dont know this man
ive come to check
on the patient
oh lilly
may i speak to you
i would like to speak
to you in english
but i feel your friends
would not approve
why would they consider it wrong
to speak in more than one language
because it would appear
as if you and i were alone
surely my reaction to your words
would tell them everything
they need to know
and what reaction is that
i dont have one
or perhaps i havent
decided yet
if you do decide
and would consider sharing
that information with me
you might meet me at
the hospital at noon
three days from now
that is when nouria will
run out of the bandages
im about to give her
and then what
that would be up to you
i would like to go somewhere
where i can see water
you dont make things easy
do you
i dont make them
any way at all
get something green
like the sea
you might be eligible for
a position as a cleaner
but that all
for 2 years i was taught
quran by the greatest
sufi master in morocco
as well as mathematics astronomy
and classical persian poetry
im sorry but nothing
youve told me
suggests you qualify for
the auxiliary nursing program
youre saying im not
capable of emptying a bedpan
im sure you are but there are
people with actual experience
just as eager to do so
if youll follow me
i speak arabic
some amharic and enough harari
and oromigna to translate
the patients
surely with the countless
refugees arriving every day
that would be helpful
be here tomorrow at eight
to meet with the supervisor
of the auxiliary
nursing program
now dont misunderstand
youll primarily be
emptying those bedpans
which weve already
established i can do
how come i always lose
when i play with you huh
he cheats
i know you
just keep going
a few more stairs
and well get you into bed
she having a baby
dont just stand there help me
where my son
he there
where my son
he there he there he right there
hold my hand
breathe breathe
hold my hand
come and sit up
oh god
dont resist
come come
come on
now
w start pushing yes that it
it coming
push now a bit harder
come on
come on
nearly there
is he okay
he is a she
hello
ahmed come and see your sister
my son
is there someone
we should call for you
someone at home
i found her in the building one over
she was looking for a woman called daisy
daisy
they said when i was
in the shelter there
that she may be
able to take us in
daisy obasi
ah okay
the rich boyfriend in
manchester he finally proposed
she gone im afraid
is there somewhere
else you can stay
she can stay with me
shell need these it gets
cold in here at night
it must be nice to have
this place all to yourself
i didnt ask for it
you didnt have to
i just need a few hours
get a little sleep
there fruit in the kitchen and
biscuits in the cupboard by the sink
oh thank you lilly
haile selassie
claims he modernizing
creating a cash-crop economy
isnt that a good thing
the farmers dont grow food
for their families anymore
they grow it for
the rich landlords
and what do they do
sell it around the world
while their own people starve
and as the emperor dogs
eat off golden plates
i had no idea
as you requested
i imagine this isnt
what you expected
i didnt know what to expect
right now
in this nearly perfect moment
it is easy to imagine
that anything is possible
that i wont see injustice
and despair everywhere i turn
when a thief looks at a saint
all he sees are pockets
so im a thief am i
it a sufi saying
it means what
we perceive in the world
tells us who we are
tell me what do you perceive
in the world
that too much to ask
then tell me what you
see when you look at me
you want to know what
i see when i look at you
i shouldnt be here
then well go
uh-oh discovered
n no im
im not doing what
you think im doing
i mean i am
but for someone in need
no i meant me
youve discovered
my hiding place
it hard to read around doctors
when theyre talking about
what it is they talk about
when they arent
doing any doctoring
that was humor
or an attempt at
something like it
then im leaving now
oh before you go
zinc oxide
nappy cream
im fatima you may
go downstairs
dont you worry ive got
everything under control
youre in for it now
they wont let me
leave for 40 days
but of course
i wont stay that long
no
that how it must be done
it will be a good thing
for both of us
really
you are full of surprises
english girl
my papa dead
mine too
it has to look
especially nice today
make sure you fluff it
im fluffing mrs peele
there you look lovely
she right
you do look lovely
my son is coming
to visit me today
perhaps a touch of lipstick
why dont we let the doctor take a look at you first
oh of course
this wont take long
i promise
no sign of infection
im very pleased
miss
abdal
right right
yes i must make note
given that were old friends
so tell me who been
attending to the surgical site
i have
for someone with no training
youre doing excellent work
which im saying because
there no sign of infection
the training comment
was not relevant at all
yes
that was meant
to be a compliment
though it likely didnt sound
like one that what it was
i was acknowledging your skill
yes of course
thank you doctor
please dont
just dont make it worse
just
good
excellent carry on
aziz
im so glad you came
i didnt know if it
was the right building
this is what we do here
we watch exactly what
the emperor wants us to see
we complain we criticize
we imagine resisting
but we still watch
you see this pale color
these are the best leaves
the sweetest
the army
is with us munir
soldiers are turning their guns
on their own corrupt officers
because they are
planning to take power
good it cant be
worse than haile selassie
it can always be worse
theyll get rid of
haile selassie
but theyll never
let the power go
you dont know what in
the minds of the soldiers
they want to feed their
family just like us
the same soldiers who are
setting fields on fire
to keep the crops
from their enemies
destroying food while
their own people starve
sadia
you are right sadia
the soldiers mutiny in
asmara and we sit and talk
the unions call for a general
strike and we sit and talk
the army arrests government
officials civilians
and guess what we do
lilly please
do you mind if we go
aziz
aah
where are we going
mr djimon
i am so sorry
what wrong
he wont say anything
i promise
i should feel nothing but shame
and no doubt i will but
in this moment im happy
i should get back
nouria will be worried
today i thought i saw someone
i knew at the hospital
chased him down the hall
it wasnt him
hmm
there is a man
i knew it
such eyes
i can see why youd
want to chase him
it wasnt like that
it wasnt
not just that
what
so many people
she looks like nouria
might she be here
i cant imagine it
she would have gone
to the shrine
and your doctor
anyone he met from home
would have sent him here
to put up a message
he said hed do
whatever it took
no matter what
then make it as easy
for him as you can
i see youve found
my favorite seat
i always come out here
early to get this bench
it uh it quiet
even when it not
you know what i mean
how can i
it doesnt make any sense
i didnt know
it actually had to
here please it yours
we could have shared it
you know
people do that all the time
i know i know i know
but i prayed all night
that sitta would sleep
so that makes up for it
that not how it works
and when i wasnt praying
i was thinking about food
now which one should i have
cabbage curry
or carrot curry
they both taste
exactly the same
my father would say curry
requires an education
interesting
tell me more
there not much to tell
my parents died
when i was seven
a child alone is
is a terrible thing
i wasnt alone
the shrine to bilal al
habeshi in morocco took me in
the great abdal became
my teacher and my father
and that the whole story
until my journey to harar
lilly
you are hopeless
what do you mean
nobody knows anything
so they fill in
the facts where they can
vertise she swears that your
father was a big game hunter
and your mother owned
a coffee plantation
why would she say that
for fun
it in a book
the thing i dont
understand is why anyone
cares about these things
because that what people
do when we come together
we tell each other our stories
and if you cant share your
story then who are you
i spoke to mrs jahangir
yesterday at the market
she said i can work there
three days a week to start
it not much but
if i get another job
you should teach
of course i should
teach
now if only my degree
my references
my experience would be
able to convince someone
other than you that
i am qualified
but that not the point
my point is
if i get another job then
we can get our own place
is that what you want
no
but surely you need me to go
ahmed be careful
what about your story
with their father
we knew what was
happening in the country
but for us everything was
it was good
yusuf started going to
these political meetings
then he took part in strikes
and protests against
the emperor
and i i said
silly man what
what are you playing at
youre an agronomist
what do you know
of such things
when haile selassie
soldiers
beat him until he was broken
and bleeding and lying at the
feet of his wife and his son
he was so surprised
dont do it
those are new shoes
ahmed
ahmed
there is no meeting today
where is aziz
what are you doing here
i i wanted to be with you
i thought there would be a meeting
djimon has heard
the house is being watched
we cannot meet here again
then when will i be
able to see you
come away with me one night
no i cant
what would i tell nouria
uh tell her you are shopping
for sadia wedding
it another lie
everything is changing lilly
everything
what does that have to do
with the nature of my sins
just say yes
say yes
yes
be careful
promise me
my goal is to bring
lilly into the 20th century
whether she likes it or not
that was my sofa
ah well this is your sofa now
i bought it from vertise
she got a new one
with blue and pink flowers
on a cream background
which looks terrible with her
green carpet if you ask me
deh nobody is
so what do you think
it very plaid
excellent observation
but it also does
something very special
ahmed come and show
auntie her surprise
this is wonderful
ive never seen anything like it
you see what i mean
every day with lilly i get
to experience the world anew
amina
are you all right
we should go to hospital
no
amina
it could be something serious
i know what it is
in the refugee camp
i had to do whatever
i could to protect ahmed
of course
the guards when they
saw i wasnt circumcised
they turned me over
and did it the other way
sometimes there is pain
sometimes there blood
it over now
it will never be over
the water cold
ill check on sitta
how long were you in the camp
eight months
you figured it out
you could have told me
which part
the shame that my yusuf
isnt her father
or the relief
that he didnt have to live
knowing what they
did to his wife
allahu akbar
you must make a truly
light meringue mrs peele
i have never been able to make a
floating island actually float
let me see
good afternoon mr jahangir
afternoon
come and see what
im doing in the storeroom
oh yes she has big plans
wants to do everything
but sell my groceries
so what do you think
about what
our new office
why do we need an office
for the ethiopian family
reunification association
but there no such thing
well there is now
see after djibouti
i had to go through
the central refugee
office in rome
there were thousands
of us just waiting
i know i was there for
i dont know how many weeks
we were there for months and we just waited
while they did their endless paperwork
now if the office in
rome could send a list
of new arrivals from ethiopia
it could be matched with
a list of people here
searching for their relatives
where would that list come from
how many
ethiopian refugees
are in our community
center alone
and almost every one of
them is just like you
like me
they want to know if the
loved ones they left behind
got out of the country alive
look my husband is gone
you dont know that for sure
you only saw them take him away
he gone
we will do this together
but for our own reasons
now i believe your
exact words were
see
you really have no choice
amina customer
do you believe miss nairobi
won wearing that dress
lilly are you going to do
that until we get to dire dawa
sadia we lied
were not going to shop
for your wedding
so what we harm no one
but what if you and i
if we both
have sex
me and munir have done it
twice
arent you worried
about my parents finding out
about your soul
ah lilly
youre so naive
i see munir
thank you
youre a very practical muslim
i like to decide
things for myself
surely you have considered the quran
is not meant to be taken literally
that it is a a story to be
interpreted by each in his own way
i am sorry
i am sorry
it has been pointed out
to me more than once
that i tend to state
the obvious
clarity is not a sin
but boring people is
ive actually tasted
liquor before
truly
when was this
when i was five-years-old
maybe six
you are teasing me
im not
my parents had very
unusual ideas
they were not muslim
no no
i have wondered
why you never spoke
of your father and mother
the great abdal
taught me to look forward
and so here you are
with a muslim who
believes his faith is
open to interpretation
yeah
here i am
a free spirit after all
no
free spirits do
not fear judgment
and so what are you
someone who risking
the chance for paradise
in the next life to be
with you in this one
the office in rome sends
a new list every month
and if your husband
name is on it
i promise i will call you
you have a daughter
god has been good to you
enough for today
let go home
what about the post
it can wait
ill get the chips
you get the curry
hello
two specials please
thank you
lilly
lilly
hi
i was just having dinner
right
would you like to join me
we have to go
it getting cold
allow me to introduce myself
amina mergessa
lilly best friend
robin sathi i work with
lilly at the hospital
ah
please we wont keep
you from your dinner
yes it waiting right there for you
lilly
amina it
it fine
and lilly youre right
a chicken dhansak as fine as ananda
should not be
allowed to get cold
amina i truly hope
we meet again soon
as do i
what is wrong with you
how could you be so rude to him
i dont know there something
about him i find very irritating
i thought he was a lovely man
perfect gentleman
yes too perfect
isnt that a good thing
stop
there is no one for me but aziz
ahmed
bring me my glasses
i dont know where they are
look for them
theyre
probably in her bag
ahmed
when i tell you
to do something
ahmed
youre going
back to mrs chilolo
but she doesnt have tv
now ahmed
do what your auntie says
your husband is alive amina
he wont be able to look at me
you dont understand
yusuf is a scholarly man
so
he knows the quran
and so do you
it says that if someone
is forced to do something
like you were
theyre not guilty if a sin
forced
when yusuf hears what
happened hell understand
i didnt fight lilly
i didnt fight
i walked into their barracks
and i offered myself to them
you did it to protect your son
stop
what would you say to any
other woman in that camp
if she had done
what she could do
to survive because
she knew her life was sacred
that it was a gift from allah
she would never leave
her child all alone
what would you say to her
i would say
i would tell her she was right
that she did the right
the right thing
what if he doesnt want sitta
you said that yusuf believed
he must always strive
to do better in the eyes of god
isnt that right
yes
then give him
the chance to do that
he alive
alhamdulillah
alhamdulillah
i dont have the words
if you only had a minute to tell
him everything you needed to
what would you tell him
about sitta
yes about sitta
and about learning
that he alive
i would tell him
now that i know
that he survived
i can let myself remember just
how much we loved each other
how he taught me
about photosynthesis
how i taught him how to dance
are you sure
move against me
are we in love
i am
how do you know
it is a feeling
right here
what is it
munir and i are not
returning to harar
things are happening in the north
we cant just watch from afar anymore
what about the hospital
this is more important
were going to fight for people
who cant fight for themselves
lilly as soon as you get back
munir uncle will put
you on a bus to djibouti
refugees are flocking there because
they have a british consulate
but you shouldnt be there
more than a few weeks
the color of your skin will put
you at the head of the line
why
lilly why do you think
you are white
you can go to england
and be anything you want to be
you dont have
you dont have to be ethiopian
you dont even
have to be muslim
how can i be anything else
im not leaving
lilly
im going back to
nouria to wait for you
you have been seen
at the meetings
if im taken
they might come for you next
and if they find you with
nouria youll be putting her
and bourtoucan in danger too
last night in addis
the army executed
60 political prisoners
over 50 of them were
their own generals
i need to know youre
somewhere safe
did you know you were
leaving me before
everything is changing
so fast lilly
does that really matter
of course it does
it not enough
but it all i have
to give for now
so you wont forget me
this wont last long
there are too many
of us for them to fight
i promise as soon as i can
ill come find you
we have to go
lilly now
people died of starvation
in northern ethiopia
not long after civil unrest
resulting from
economic pressures
brought an end to emperor
haile selassie regime
and the military took over
now the same civilians who
helped bring about change
are being imprisoned without
charge tortured and executed
and the ruling military party
has virtually closed off
the country from
the outside world
as they continue
to jostle for power
hello

tell me it was god will
because my mother had told me

time ive seen you in here
when you havent had
a book right in your face
you must really like them
books i i assume
youre right
i like books too
well im in a bit of a
a science fiction rut
you know bradbury
asimov le guin
perhaps you could
recommend a change of
no i cant
that too bad
i thought perhaps literature
might just be
the conversational ticket
im sorry
i dont mean to bother you
it was it was
a pleasure almost having
a conversation with you
miss abdal
im sorry
i hope you havent
been waiting long
i have no appointment
please come in
please have a seat mr
my name is tariq
this is the right place
you are lilly abdal
yes please come in
thank you
what can i help you with
are you trying to find someone
ill make you some coffee
i was held in a prison
near the somali border
i was not there long before
a guard beat me in such a way
that when he finished
there was only darkness
i could no longer see
then the doctor came
he had been part of the resistance
to the military takeover
he too was a prisoner
he was tortured
but even so
he cared for all of us
he promised my blindness
would not last
you see
he did not lie
he was the best man
because of him
many of us were
spared further pain
do you know what
happened to him
a day came
when a guard
took many of us
into a courtyard
they told us we would
have a good show
counter-revolutionary
that what they called us
but then
they brought him out
the doctor
he would not die on his knees
lilly im going to get zema
what are you doing here
first drink
you managed to get
quite dehydrated
with a doctor in the next room
i might have to reconsider
my career choice
mm-mm keep going
there you go
now tell me
please
right
someone named senit
found you on the floor
outside your flat
she got your spare key
from someone named vertise
who then called mrs jahangir
who then called amina in canada
and she called the hospital
and tracked down
me
that means i must
have told senit
i believe you did lilly
so everyone knows
everyone knows
i see youve found some
new reading material
i never thanked you
not properly
for recommending
science fiction
for taking care of me
there no need
of course there is
well then i believe
i should thank you as well
for inspiring me to expand
my literary horizons
sufi poetry
so you see
it a
it a good deal all around
when i was seven years old
my parents took me to morocco
we went to a sufi shrine
at the edge of the sahara
they left me there
and they never came back
it wasnt until years later
that i found out what
happened to them
and even then all i was told
was that drugs were involved
and that they died together
i dont i dont
know what to say
it all right
i was happy there
and i was loved
i would have stayed
there forever if i could
of course i can call back
but it will be to speak
with your supervisor
lilly how much there is
to tell you about alberta
today i met
a woman in the market
we reached for
the same melon
she came here alone from chile
after her family was killed
during the military coup
she said she has put
down roots here
and in that moment
i knew i could do that too
and not just because i ended
up with the melon
we are branches from
the same tree my sister
we must plant ourselves
where we are
and know in our hearts
that we are home

charlie charlie
charlie
we have a major crime progress on the
200 lift hours building give me a third
law assignment three additional truck
companies and all available air bottles
i didnt want you have rescue problem
negative we had one fatality one man
injured the injured man has been
identified as a security guard he said
there nobody else in the building
tell us the problems his men are having
with this fire chief maca can you tell
us please what going on kula for one
thing the fire started 26 feet above
ground level and we dont have aerial
equipment i enough to reach that far
so everything were fighting this fire
with has to be carried up on our backs i
see there a surprising lack of flames
visible from the outside why is that
well that because a tall building like
this is like a giant incinerator the
heat and smoke and flames go straight up
nobody literally becomes a chimney and
any inside opening like an elevator
shaft or a stairwell or air-conditioning
ducts just sucks the smoke they hate the
flames straight up and pushes of outward
we cant get above it so we have to
fight it from below so to chase it from
florida floor where the fire has already
climbed seventh floor so far now is
there a possibility would go all the way
to the top yeah there always that
possibility but were certainly going to
do everything we can to keep that from
happening
well what steps here would you be excuse
me more vino anyone no no im gonna just
stay with it just happened have another
bottle all night yeah i would say i had
the last epistle i read anywhere i said
that there about 50 00 some odd percent
women really like him dont you

good presentation i mean you and him

party anyway dont let her worry i mean

our own bottle

medium and you buy your clothes at
boardman suppressives youve done quite
a bit of research little not exactly hot
office gossip but interesting what about
the negative side you mean like a wife i
do have one
every successful executive shoot
boys we have a lot of trouble hole in
this thing the fires extended at the
utility shaft in the 7th floor to get
those hoses up in a hurry italian
seventh italian one im sending three
additional companies the air
conditioning is shoving heat the smoke
into the upper floors im gonna shut off
the power
we need those elevators chief the guys
will drag it from blowing stuff up a
stairwell i dont those flames carry any
higher right then let me cut the power
on the fire thatll shut off the air
conditioners and well still have part
of the rest of the building all right
try but those flames company higher up
the power to everything come on thank
you

subtle it not my business but took a
big chance i did yeah i think if
overland finds you poking around in the
confidential files hed probably fire
you right on the spot probably yeah but
dad i wouldnt worry about kelly he
wont find out unless somebody tells him
well she not telling exactly why
should you
we cant hold this thing here it
extending to the air-conditioning
dont let this thing get around back of
us well never get up
he broken through the 9th chief the
air conditions must have tripped on the
convoy that shut it off give me five
more minutes were bringing up 40
ejectives on the elevator right now ive
got a really crew kimono i gotta shut
the building down and get your light
generators up to the fire floor one all
right okay instead of italian one jeff
go ahead nicky get a crew down to the
basement right away she chopped off a
whole part of the building everything
it probably quick on fire something in
the basement nothing to worry about gigi
mom you could i forget me darlene would
you get my briefcase that that brown
one on the desk in there you think i
should go fireball that a good idea
but maybe we ought to find out what it
is for it
wonder if stash is still downstairs ten
after eight on christmas hating i dont
know everything gonna be all right
ginger
sorry it smokey yeah yeah try not to
breathe too much of this stuff well my
clothes are gonna pick up this too
that a real tragedy elevators on his
way up we should be out in the fresh air
in a couple minutes this is one way to
break up a party those are the emergency
lights yeah there that
well cant you break it down or
something solid steel hong kong fix that
dead fly those lines over there

build ginger not barn all right you
stick with me were gonna
we dont pitch this thing out here it
going to run sweat off the windows and
it a long way down
give me some more line
even though we can hardly see any
visible evidence of a fire from our
vantage point here on the street fire
department tells us there are now at
least seven floors involved and they
still have not been able to bring it
under control i remember now
they sealed off these windows when i put
in the air conditioning well cant you
break one theyre reinforced with wire
good what to do anyway i mean but 40
stories high well we could yell with
somebody down the street dont be stupid
betty they couldnt hear us from up here
they could even see us at night might be
why is it going easy on that stuff
howard that a management directive or
just a personal opinion nothing like a
little get-together with the home office
once a year dan
we understand this is only about 30
minutes after the last group of people
left the building where they had been
having an office party on the top floor
it cant be thankful that these lucky
people are home now safe with their
families what a blessing this fire

and remember that we still had some host
backs in the disabled elevator so we had
their horse adorable it happened
sometime after we kept our guard told us
it was nobody else in the building
come on the discovery of a body in the
elevator shaft adds yet another grim
complication to this christmas eve
tragic read the victim has tentatively
been identified as an employee of the
hendrik industries which we understand
occupies the top five floors in the
whitney talents the fire department now
faces the possibility that there may be
other people still trapped inside the
building
he didnt know ago my fault he dead
dead come on kelly
yeah guilty your tally remaining name
though what difference does it make now
a fire department helicopter is just
landing to pick up a paramedic rescue
team chief packer is ordered an
emergency search in the building from
the roof down to the fire
as you can see the rescue team is
loading equipment aboard the helicopter
they should be taking off momentarily
in here in here
were moving in this west room okay okay
be careful
hey it sweeping around life
by the guy
his whole burn through that all she
wrote
thank you big enough we need to put a
half
4 wall is collapsed on 36 to
backtrack then you get them out we dont
have to water them
too much fire all right stick with it do
what you can ill get help up right away

up there ill send up air bottles hurry
i cant you do something but it wont
change anything
why did you do it though did you bring
that out i thought somehow it might
please you well how nice i thought for
some obscure reason that hanging benji
started with care might make things a
little happier around here dont you
remember how he always used to go to the
stocking first alright oh i could see
this is gonna be a wonderful christmas
alright let talk about it again
never mind i said let go me dad no
what about last month a picture of benji
at that summer camp and before that a
relaxing evening with a stamp collection
now it got to stop
benji seems to be the only thing we have
in common these days in fact i think he
probably was the only thing we ever had
that kept us together and we made a
mistake obviously since we cant even
talk about our own son anymore benji is
dead summer he been dead for six
months im sorry
im sorry
im sorry
and your car
pharr is now completely out of control
an attempt to stop it on the 36th floor
has failed
costing the life of one fireman and
critically injuring several others if
the rumor is true if there are still
people on the upper floors there is grim
doubt that they could survive the
intense heat and smoke the fire
department is still struggling
desperately to stop the upper floors
from being engulfed by flame but there
doesnt seem to be much chance that they
can do it
here foolish line
my air
right here
their rescue this is one after the truck
get back in the air do a 360 around the
building use your spotlight check the
window see if there any sign of people
in the building
we cant hold it here careful careful
but stay together tell you one kitchen
45 weve lost the 38th floor were
backing out into the ceiling and going
up the vent
search team this is one can you read me
were going down a stairwell from the
rope and there a lot of smoke up here

fast

it freaking me out
your world is in trouble
joshua
we have watched from a great
distance
and observed that you have
become a danger
your weaponry is too advanced
you have endangered
your own planet
and have become too big of a
threat to others in the future
the end is here
but your world can be saved
it can save itself
if you can show me that there is
value in human life
the destruction can be sto
prove this to me and there will
be a tomorrow
scoffs
he should be here any second
you have till the sun is down
at the end of this day to

myron
she talking sir
excellent
where exactly are you from
sigh
why are you here
she said she wants us to show
her the value of human life
sir
or what
maybe she should tell you
what is your purpose here
what exactly did she tell you
tv woman speaking
you have until the sun is down
at the end of this day to
find a solution
was she actually reading
your mind
yes sir
prove that human life has
value how the hell are we
supposed to do that
take her to see the
goddamn lion king
how can we even be sure that
she being honest with us
it could be a ployed to escape
i for one am gonna need
a little more information
or questioning
exactly she proven she can
talk now just a matter of
getting the answers
plus if she can talk theyh
can talk i think we work on the
man immediately
maybe she cares about him
we can use that to get her to
tell us what we need to know
prewitt it a good point
guard no sir
let interrogate individually
and then well try a group
session okay
sir
i believe her
it not that simple
well the farthest thing she
asking to experience is
continuing to be locked up here
subjected to--
interrupts
she dangerous myron
youre forgetting that because
of the face she wearing
dont you remember how she
defended herself at the crash
site
you think she gandhi with
powers like that
at least we have to keep trying
we have to figure out a waf
showing her how valuable life is
inside this facility
cause she never going outside
these walls
clears throat
hey
youre going to have to
talk to these guys
what your
name
it difficult
to say in your
language

commander and what about the

i cant explain to you
the value of human life
i mean you want to know about a
9 millimeter im your man
im not a philosopher
i dont know the value
of human life
in fact if you really want to
know the truth
im not so sure at all it means
anything myself
revs engine
it appears to be
an emp sir
everything that relies
on electricity is
useless for the moment
vehicles-
i know what an emp is
how long till
were back up
no telling
anything word from
sharon before we
lost power
no sir
goddamn dark ages
the electric pulse corresponds
to 2 criteria
it is a result of the
simultaneous magnetic beams
and it also serves as harbinger
to the seriousness of the
situation
a harbinger
a sign of things to come
clear the room
what going on out there
did you thing that there
would not be consequences
to your actions
so whatever happening is
because of us
the actions of your kind are
predictable
that is why she was sent
to put an end to the inevitable
we will find a way to breach
those things
since you know us so well you
know we dont give us very
easily
yes
unfortunately there is no
what do you mean
the countdown has begun
the man is
talking again
what he saying
the countdown
has begun
what countdown
that save humanity
crap
there been some
repercussions due to the
tempt of dc mageliths
if any of the pilots survived
we lost communications due to
the electrical magnetic pulse
but before we lost
communications we were able to
capture some vital information
each of the mageliths across the
globe has begun to omit a high
intensity energy theme
focused on one central
location the earth core
result of this will cause
the core spin to slow
cause the core to spin to
in other words the earth is
beginning to tilt off it
normal axis
doesnt make any sense
why what do they stand to gain
from this strategically makes
no sense
hum
well that a good sign
how long do we have
well it only an assumption-
interrupts
how long
the earth is large
even for the mageliths-
both interrupt
how long
what are we talking
about here days
weeks

my short time on the
other side
taught me that we need to learn
to live in harmony
no just with ourselves but
with the entire universe
they returned to their planet
leaving us here to
pick up the pieces
families were reunited
our cities rebuilt
somehow every night my eyes
search the stars wondering where
she might be in one of them
we learned the value of peace
just as the memory of
her face would fade
so would the warning that
she had brought with her
our world once divided
learned to hopetogether
but i knew
they would be watching

whatever you
guys are weird
adios santiago
adios stacey have a wonderful evening
goodnight stacey
steven i need to speak to you
ah what up alan
i examined the employee log in
human resources
and there no information about
your pending promotion
oh yeah
it happened super last minute so
probably hasnt been updated yet
i checked with payroll and there no start
paperwork submitted for the wage increase
i actually agreed to maintain my
bellman rate
until i have sufficiently trained
our newest bellman hire josh
whom youve met
yes joshua met i have
great
but there a different
insurance
which covers management
and the paperwork for that
hasnt been submitted yet either
well yes
that because since weve employed
the new cashless tipping app bravo
we also implemented a new
paperless paper app
called paper
that cant be
i would know if there was some new
app that we were supposed to have
it brand new super new
literally just happened
like we
guys were talking about it
it getting launched
i just got a text about it in
the old palm pilot
so you know so that that
you know what alan
this seems like there still a lot
of information to be picked up on
so im gonna talk
im going to go find to brad
about
what would brad know
he just a common bellman
oh wow
alan how dare you
im right here
brad is one of our top employees

when my promotion is
complete
congratulations again on your promotion
thank you so much
im going to go talk to susan
great tell her i said hi
tell her we said what up
im sorry i got stuck all
right these guys are worthless
worth is only measured less by the man who
values less worth than what he actually worth
thus worthlessness cannot be worth
less than what it is worthless

and were gonna be screwed
what are you doing
this is ops for alan

approached by this big investor
who has an in with the indian
reservation and gaming board
and he wants to turn the place
into a casino and i
i dont qualify for that
and i love this place

and that it
what is he talking about
i dont know susan
he has been impersonating a
manager and that is a felony
i dont think that a felony
alan youre very sweaty
he led me to believe that he was
up for a very specific job
and then he was parading it all
around the hotel
there are liability issues
ethics issues
he should be fired
okay all right all right just
hold on just calm down
stop the music
what the hell is
going on
i have proof that gunther is using
sanz hand sanz hand sanz hands
hand sanitizer
to brainwash his followers
let me see that
you went into his room
you broke into a guest room
i think that a felony
well yes but not because
i told him to
i was trying to prove that gunther
is conning everyone with spirifresh

has he done for any of you
what physical product has he
actually provided
let get him

steve the physical product is
the metaphysical being
it hard for him to learn
what the hell does that mean
what are you clapping for
yes
why are you crying man
okay okay
then what with all the
sanz hands hand sanitizer
what it called
sanz hands hand sanitizer
i believe in clean hands guys

well gunther well why do you have
a thousand bottles of this stuff
ew gross
damn it josh
omg that hot
that right there not appropriate
come on
ah-ha that
i suffer from mysophobia
which is a fear of germs
one that is debilitating
then i read the teachings of khatkhate
baba who showed me the way of clean
the way of the sanz hands
hand sanitizer
which also was leading me on the
path to spirifresh
okay if you buy in
bulk like larger bottles
you could probably save a lot of
money that way
just look at me josh
it like the eskimo
like the eskimos
thank you josh we love him
we love you
i love josh i love josh
i love him here too

wants to derail this poor conductor

it it all about you

steve is the all-beef patty and were
all just lettuce tomato onions
steve is the sun rotating
around all of us stupid planets
youre right i was only
thinking about what i wanted
but it not about me
i get that now
it about us
it about you guys
it about the bellmen
also you know the planets
revolve around the sun right

people as it a scientific fact
it actually making me think you know
less of you when you say stuff like that

connections inside the bank
the manager i guess he
the one who hired me

who bell captain these days
i think rhonda
that makes sense
she wrestled skinny jeremy
in cashew milk
i wouldve paid to
see that
what up kid
hey brad

you just going to wing it
yeah
michael the reason im
back here
truth be told i was very content
in the desert with steve
you took up a lover

go we got to get out of here
friend slap
hey what are you guys
doing until 700
um hello
hi im leroy
im alan
let finish early tonight
i want to get home
oh i cannot do that for you because
time is a construct of the mind
so i dont know when were going to
fine 900-930 latest
und the reason
that snoopy und woodstock never
speak to the other peanuts
is because snoopy and woodstock
are the ghosts of dead children
what am i doing here i sign
the contracts tomorrow
mr whitman before you sign anything
there something you need to see
and i ask you
who controls your heart
hmm it not who you
think it you
steve controls our heart
no that was a separate thought
today is the day that i prove to
my friends and previous employers
that i am worthy of
not just a paycheck
but a journey of responsibility
i have proof that gunther is
going to sign a deal
to buy the hotel tomorrow and he
going to turn it into an indian casino
who cares
he making us perfect
gunther is not even
native american
nor does he have the
collateral for the loan
he a fraud i have here in my
hand
he has no proof
proof
oh wow he got proof
this is his birth certificate
look at this he not
chief macanopy
his name isnt even gunther
gochamonet which is a little on the nose
this is his business license
youll notice he
misspelled llc
all fake it means nothing without
my lender agreement from the bank
and this is his lender
agreement from the bank
shite
and we have banky to thank for that info
give banky a round of applause
he is scamming you
he is scamming the great state of arizona
he is scamming the great city of
tucson and sid he scamming you
this is a bunch of bs pardon
my language
because ill tell
you right now this is fake
and there a whole other point
of view in which what i said was true
im just sick of the white
man lies
sister you and me
both yeah
very different story than what
you hear right now from this
guess what psycho big bird the
one been stealing all the robes
that could be any robe anywhere
no that is the robes
it could be from any place

trap of a con artist

followers out of money
while also lying about his
heritage in order to buy the hotel

with this right now
but shove it up my ass
that where i draw the line
that a whole
new ball game
in sarajevo
we take it up the butt
every day
he in slow motion
we call her florence
what like nightingale
yeah
why
okay stop
because on her first caving expedition
someone got hurt
so this guy cuts himself
on his knee
oh wait
it wasnt just a cut
no no no youre right
it was a tiny cut
tiny
oh you bitch
but florence here
decides that she was
going to wrap it
and wrapped it and yes
you may have guessed it
she wrapped it again
you bitch
but seriously
id love to lead my own cave expedition
of children
of grown-ups
be the first to explore
a new cave
itd be amazing
certainly have a lot more
fun than those guys
especially gannon
how long has it been
two years tomorrow
yeah that what changed him
what do you mean
what happened
it--it wont go in the book
if i tell you
youre gonna wanna put it in
it wont
youve got my word
do you guys know
no
we meet gannon today
all right ori
you can trust me
two years ago
we were caving in peru
me miranda
bailey domingo gannon
there were some
other guys there
but they dont
work for us anymore
and there was
another woman rachel
his fiancée
it was the beginning
of the rainy season in peru
and we were trying to get out
of a cave that was flooding
and she didnt make it
we were all you know
really close to her
im sorry
yeah gannon was the only one
that saw her die
her body was never found
are you saying
there more to the story
no
then what are you saying
nothing
that it
well im gonna go to bed
me too
get some sleep
so
you guys thinking
about tomorrow
you getting what you need
for your book
yeah yeah i am
caving is a whole new world
for a lot of people i mean
i mean you know
you show them a photo
it opens them up to
a whole new universe right
every photo you sell
furthers caving
yeah
were lucky to be
making a living doing it
so so what are
your thoughts exactly
on caving
what do you mean
i mean
what your philosophy
how do you approach it
i wanna know what makes you go down there
there something
about caves that alive
there something down there that
if were open to it
we can connect with
i look for that connection
every time i go down
i crave it
youre a brujo
his father was
so you believe in spirits
like spirit of the earth
spirit of the sun
yeah i do
and cave spirits
the most unpredictable of all
interesting
everyone has
their own beliefs
what hanging
from your neck
it a cross
if something as magnificent
or as terrible as god
is possible
anything is right
right
yeah but i wasnt saying
throughout history
caves have been a sacred place
for almost every religion
in existence
remember jesus was buried
and resurrected in a cave
im sorry
i wasnt trying to offend you
so why do you do it
we havent found them all
everyone knows where
the highest mountains are
the deepest seas
but caves
caves are the last unexplored frontier on earth
there nothing more
exciting than that
my grandfather used
to climb through caves
to find new mining lines
on the east coast
hed say
apollo had it easy
cause everyone knows
where the moon is
but no one knows
where im going
so are there any events
or anything about
caving that you regret
over the years ive found
that it hard to control
what happens down there
it a beast and not
all beasts can be tamed
and that what
you need to understand
things happen in caves that dont happen anywhere else
when youre down there
youre in darkness
an eternal
never-ending world of night
down there miles beneath
the earth surface
youre surrounded
by miles of rock
you know a wrong step
can send you down a chasm
hundreds of feet deep
and if you get
hurt down there
maybe break an arm
or break a leg
there no ambulance nearby
no hospital
chances are you wont be
brought out alive
the only way to survive it over and over is to respect it
respect where you are
respect what it is
bailey bailey
hold on im coming
is everyone asleep
yeah
come on itll be fun
stop
wait what was that
bat

i believe i heard there were three people

i know youre only doing your job dpo
im still in shock
that he accused me of killing his son
that i practically raised

ill discredit you beyond imagination
this wont end here
chief please stay out of this for now
you will see
continue
what do i stand to gain from killing mike
mm-hmm
were you aware there were
three of them in the car that day
yes i did
how frequently did you speak to mike
what has that got to do with this
what im asking is
when last did you speak to mike
the day of the incident
and what did you speak about
he was asking about my welfare
he was asking me how i was faring
were you sick
do you need to be sick
before youre asked about your welfare
how you are faring
did he say he was going to the tailor
yes he did
and you knew he was in the car
with his fiancée and her friend
you obviously have
prior information about this situation
could that be what you heard
from my secretary
shouldnt we take it seriously
you called for them
to kill the three of them
nonsense
mm
arrant nonsense
how could someone who is reasonable
somebody who is sensible
could have believed that
well i was hoping youd tell us
what happened was there was this sacrifice
i needed to do
i instructed my son
to kill all the three rams
that was what happened
he who lives by the sword
will die by the sword
no longer human beings but rams now
he who lives by the sword
will die by the sword
yes
i get it you want the devil
ill show you the devil
youll see this case is going further
youll see my wrath
sir this ram isnt big
it not as big as the other one
this one bigger
this one is bigger
also this one is older

he instructed us to kill the three rams
how can we kill all three

the conversation you had over the phone
i was--
i was only rebuking my sister efia

coma
all the blogs have carried it
that what i was talking to her about
over the phone

-----NewMovie-----
the ancient greeks
believed humans once had four arms
four legs and a single head
made of two faces
we were happy
complete
so complete that the gods
fearing our wholeness would quell
our need for worship cleaved us in two
leaving our split selves
to wander the earth in misery
forever longing
longing
longing
for the other half of our soul
it is said that when one half
finds its other
there an unspoken understanding
a unity
and each would know no greater joy
than this
of course
the ancient greeks
never went to high school
good hang out
whatever
or theyd realize
crap
we dont need the gods
to mess things up for us
if you ask me
people spend far too much time
looking for someone to complete them
how many people find perfect love
or if they do
make it last
more evidence of camus theory
that life is irrational
and meaningless
and that my friends is some
a-plus love philosophy right there
or a-minus if mrs g is in a bad mood
either way it an a or you dont pay
outside are the dogs the sorcerers
the immoral persons
and everyone who loves
and practices lying

to strut your stuff mandatory

with sticky valves

you fill up my senses
like a night in a forest
like the mountains in springtime
like a walk in the rain
like a storm in the desert
in case you havent guessed
this is not a love story
are you men or are you losers
come on ladies let go
coming through
or not one
where anyone gets what they want
come fill me again
munsky
come let me love you
notice the lack
of fire and brimstone in no exit

im 7
ive lived in squahamish my whole life
such a downer
it not a downer
a major downer
ask her to hang out
what exactly is
hanging out
you know uh hanging out
but like what do you do
munsky what up
uh uh confession
want to go to joey and hang out
yeah
i hang out with my friends
i keep my head down
im a simple
paulie
guy
this meat wont grind itself
which is to say
if i knew what love was
i would quote myself
right here man
people air weather
why would we ever leave
psst
in here
isnt this sacrilegious
she wrote back
dear paul
you know it takes  muscles to yawn
this is the sort of weird fact
i find myself recalling
to keep myself from
well yawning
we believe that god loves us
or showing anything i feel really
we believe blindly and
so yeah
i turn to other people words too
imagine how the right gravel
can change your life
sweetheart sit up straight please
like a lady
when youre a pretty girl
and i know it makes me sound conceited
but that why youre even writing me
right
when youre a pretty girl
people want to give you things
it would look so cute on you
what they really want
oh
is to make you like them
thanks
not like them as in i like you
but like them as in i am like you
like
so cute on you
oh
oh you you mean right now
mm-hmm
check me out check me out
im underground
so im like a lot of people
which makes me kind of no one
every inch of my design
is far from grace
uh
can i text her now
too soon
no im gonna do it
if you want her to think
youre like everyone else
i never really thought about
the oppression of fitting in before
the good thing about being different
is that no one expects you
to be like them
hey wait for me
doesnt everyone
think theyre different but
pretty much were all different
in the same way
says the girl
perched on the rarefied peak
of mt popularity
babe
taco time
easy mr i know nothing about love
i may surprise you
so where do you wanna go
i want to go somewhere
where i could get pajamas
do you wanna go to gap
the one in tukwila has a gapbody
i love gapbody
it has like 5 dressing rooms
oh it the better gap
so much better
than the one in wenatchee
ugh wenatchee
oh my god go look at molly posts
eww
she looks so gross
she looks so gross
why would she post that
i have no idea
trig checked in at dick fry fry
aster is so lucky
totes lucky
his family owns half of squahamish
hers doesnt even own their house
youre so rude
you know that it true
yeah it true
what surprising is people
dont see what theyre not looking for
the obvious unseen
so
this is why half my class
is failing their essays
ill be reopen for business soon enough
and this cant go on much longer
ive been thinking about what you said
about seeing and not seeing
yes i do
i had a painting teacher
once tell me that
the difference between a good painting
and a great painting
is typically five strokes
and theyre usually
the five boldest strokes in the painting
the question of course
is which five strokes
i get it after one slaved away
at making a pretty good painting
the last thing youd want to do
is make a bold stroke and potentially
ruin everything
that why i gave up painting
still i wonder if that
is how im living my life
hey babe
which one
right one right
great
let do this
it a
pretty good life
probably the best life one could hope for
in squahamish
perhaps
but how well
do you really know squahamish
oh so that your boldest stroke
im into the slow build
what was that
decisiveness
but please
take all the time you need to be bold
is this bold enough for you
and thus was abstract art born
and transformed
hey
hey
or not
everything beautiful
is ruined eventually
maybe that the thing
if you do ruin your painting
you gotta know
you have everything in you
to get to that
pretty good painting again
but if you never
do the bold stroke
youll never know
if you couldve had a great painting
triangle is different
all polygons with three sides
take one side away
now it just an angle
add a side that a square
when does the dating start
this is dating
no dating is burgers
and fries and shakes
and maybe another order of fries

yes
are you ready for this
yes sir yes sir
shh
so in no exit
three people are trapped in hell
a door opens but nobody leaves
that nuts he cant stand these people
a door opens and he doesnt leave
he trapped in hell
it a metaphor for existence
my nana hated minnesota she left
your nana wasnt one of
the great thinkers of the 20th century
nana not trapped in hell either
hey hey where are you going
the hell got into munsky
youre like some marvelous distant
well queen i guess

key thing about the philadelphia story
is it a plea for tolerance
check this out im calling it
taco sausage do you want a bite
no so tolerance
two hand foods one great taste
conversation is like ping-pong
i hit one and then you
what the
oops
were writing a profile
on the student we most admire
oh cool cool
views on women in the workplace
does aster like lean meats
what are you doing
im good cop
then how come you arent smiling
ill smile when you follow the plan
that i carefully
im surprised more kids
havent asked to interview me huh
im going in
im going in with my smile
looks like the moose have a man open
oh
youre not hungry
not if it not time to eat
now that weird
hey uh can i ask you a question
i dont want to try a taco sausage
why squahamish
just like your dad seems so unhappy here
and you also seem kind of unhappy
i gotta go
no no no wait
no youre not taking this seriously
i have a ton of work i have to do
no just youre so smart
like too smart to like
waste my time trying to win you a girl
wholl never look your way
no it just seems weird
youre weird
no yes
enjoy your happy life in squahamish
no no
the thing about no exit is it like how
what i really want is to run my own shop
with new recipes and and fyi
taco sausage is really effing good
okay but im the fourth son
and my family been making
the same sausage for 49 years
and it doesnt matter
if theyre going broke or out of style
theyre nana recipes
if ma cant have nana
at least she can make her sausages
if i break away itll break her heart
and it either her heart or mine
so i stay
we had to go
where my dad could get a job
he studied trains
engineering
phd no less
so uh
he became the station manager
at squahamish
to start
the plan was to be promoted
to system engineer
or anything engineer
squahamish was a jumping-off point
it turns out speaking good english
trumps having a phd
or one from china anyway
and my dad he
doesnt speak very good
he not bad
i dont speak very good either
true
what your excuse
how do you feel about pot roast
i should get back to the station
i know but weve gotta eat
mom
tommy stop friending my friends
would you like to weigh in or are you
just gonna scream throughout the meal
ill deal with the dog wrestling
mom
it your fault
or we could go to your place
match energy match strokes
and just say one thing
where were you born
in squahamish
what about you
okay good that wasnt so hard
but where were you born
i dont need talking practice
it just seems
like a really short conversation
i was born in xuzhou china
when did you come here
when i was five
what do you like about squahamish
uh
ive never been anywhere else
me neither
how does satan get his message through
outside are the dogs the sorcerers
the immoral persons
does he write letters
no he causes us to question
question our lives our path
our very faith in god
satan plants the seed of doubt
and from that seed grows sin
sin is everywhere
were lucky to live in a good town
like squahamish
but the world is changing
let us stay strong against satan call
lest sin creep in and destroy
the good life god has prepared for us
you know what it like to finally meet
someone your age who gets you

youre the third
emperor of rome
whom ive served
first there was caligula
then claudius
and now you nero
you send general lucius
caesennius paetus
to defend armenia against
the might of parthia
im the one who invaded
armenia in the first place
i dont goddamn believe it
i dont fucking believe it
what goin on
i should be the one
to repel the parthians
not that cocksure paetus
and you order me
to safeguard what syria
from who
parthians are besieging
our legions in armenia
and there a heavy
winter coming
you better hope emperor
that the power of rome
rests solely not in the hands
of your appointed generals
but in the hearts of those
anonymous soldiers
who make up your legions
oh
proceed marcus
what is the latest
a new message
from the parthians
they demand we surrender
they give us three days
they guarantee we will not
be killed if
burn it
surrender is not an option
general
i said no
damn it
the parthians control
the pass
the scythians have cut off
our supply route here
if we dont get help
well die of starvation
do you also think
that this is all my fault
for making camp
in a place
that can easily be besieged
that this is all the result
of my incompetence
this is no time
to look back
were in no position
to sustain a prolonged siege
our own men remain loyal
but the mercenaries
have deserted
god damn mercenaries
any word from corbulo
i sent three of my best men
as emissaries
they all chose
separate routes
but the mountains are thick
with enemies familiar
with our plans
they all failed
there is one final option
take the only route the enemy
will not expect us to take
a handful
of well-prepared men
could scale the ravine
once in the forest
it a seven-day
forest march to syria
and corbulo scouts
are you telling me marcus
that a few of our men
exhausted and starving to death
will be able
to scale a cliff
walk and run
through the forest
battle the enemy
and reach syria
in just a few days
precisely
i can see that im not the
only one who has lost his head
it the only route
that will not be crawling
with the enemy
meanwhile
we can make them believe
were contemplating
the terms of the surrender
corbulo that bastard
i never imagined that
my greatest political foe
would one day be
my only hope for survival
and what if
after all this
he refuses to come
to our aid
it a risk we have to take
the route is impossible
have you already considered
whom to entrust
with this lunacy
he is a soldier
raised in the mountains
of north hispania
excellent climber and fighter
highly revered
by the auxiliary cohorts
auxiliary cohorts
he might desert
he is a soldier
loyal to rome
there are others
younger stronger
but none with his capacity
to endure
what his name
they call him noreno
do you think he will do it
if it an order
hell obey it to the end
yes an order
duty
a soldier lot is nothing
but to obey orders
to fight and sacrifice
one life
without thinking
what is hard
is to make decisions
they must leave tonight
we are all already dead marcus
your plan is impossible
i can already see corbulo
as he hears the news
of my defeat
the outcome
of my strategic blunder
his smile
we are going to need
great assistance from the gods
if we are basing our hopes
on a mountain man
but if the gods
are willing
so be it
sir
noreno the soldier is here
noreno
you called for me sir
youve been selected
to deliver a message
to general corbulo
the others failed
because they chose
a wrong route
youll go by one
the enemy does not expect
through the ravine
sir
what you ask of me
is impossible
impossible or not
that our only chance
to survive
i am aware
of your qualities
i didnt select you
for your obvious skills
you were chosen because of
your rare capacity to endure
if anyone can succeed
it you
we have provisions
for only two more days
if the enemy doesnt
kill us then
the lack of food
or the cold will
the entire roman legion
destroyed disgraced
you must succeed
when do i leave
now
when you leave the camp
run straight for the ravine
scale its walls
once in the forest head southwest
till you hit syria
and corbulo scouts
help me return to rome
help me see my son
i will do my best
when you reach corbulo
give him this
that parchment
bears paetus seal
oh may the gods
protect you
go out from here and run
as if hades himself
were pursuing you
for rome
im sorry my friend
go
run
come on
no
si
another idiotic roman
who believes he can cross
these terraces to seek help
what do i do with him saka
damn proud romans
when are they ever
going to stop
their pride
is what makes them great
they cant go far
look over there
here
here the famous ravine
go
two of the romans
are dead
the other scaled
the cliff face
that route is impossible
nothing is impossible
if you have the will
to survive
theyre just deserters
they sacrificed themselves
so that he could succeed
he making his way
to corbulo
the persians pay us to kill
romans not to let them escape
madyes you and saulio
make your way to the river
hell have to cross it
eventually
ill send word
to the persians
yeah for now
so claudius tell me
how far have you traveled
to arrive at the frontier
hibernia
hibernia
that the edge
of the world
what a celt doing
at the roman auxiliary
i heard the pay was good
pay
like most children
on the coast of hibernia
i was captured
and taken to britannia
as a slave
i was a game keeper
ward but
they couldnt hold me
he says do you
did you ever want to return home
i was away from home
too long
i wanted to see the world
so i made my way to gaul
and joined the auxiliary
theyve been the only family
ive ever known
and for that im thankful
he says you shouldve gone
to hispania
it his land
very beautiful there
um i was raised by
my grandfather in hispania
and uh when he joined
the auxiliary
he was stationed
in britannia
so i followed him
and fought alongside him
however when he died
i decided i would return
to hispania
i carried his body
to the top of the mountain
and there i laid him down
so the vultures could carry
his soul to the afterlife
however when i returned
to the auxiliary
i met marcus
he recognized
my ability and
well he gave me
a purpose
oh oh i think he means
uh for rome
si si
uh for rome
yes
for rome
for rome
rome
for rome
let her go
get out
do you live here alone
where is your family
noreno
duria
i wouldnt do it
look let me go
i dont have anything
to give you
i know that youre
a deserter but
believe me when i say
i will not tell anyone
where you are
i will not betray you
do you think
im actually afraid
youll tell someone
where i am
im not that important
that in
theyll need
to send soldiers after me
i have no interest
in what made you desert
but let me go
you will have helped save
an isolated legion
that has no chance
of survival
i dont care about you
or your damn legion
now let see what
youve got in the bag
a message with a roman
general seal on it
i should be able to get
something nice for this
you take what you like
but you leave me that
try to remember
that you were
a legionnaire too
rome and all her glory
can burn in hell
for all i care
thank you
thank you
a soldier life
is lived outdoors
in every damn
imaginable weather
im sure that something
you cant imagine nero
but when youre
a roman soldier
you get used
to your hardships
and what doesnt kill you
only makes you stronger
look over there
who the hell are you
let me go
please i beg of you
im a roman soldier
im on a mission of mercy
my men have no food
and no water
nobody cares
least of all me
i just wanna sell you
scyles
how the hell did you get all
the way out here with just this
scyles
shit
that man belongs to me
yeah well these
bonds say otherwise
youre getting old
and slow medea
turn around
go back to your woman
solias
oh wait
you cant
i killed her
this world is mine
anyone who comes
across this patch
belongs to me
she wandered too far
and now
she paid the price
this bounty is mine
and i am claiming my reward
take my hand
take it
steady soldier
stay calm
youre safe
rest
no i cannot rest
where am i
how long have i been here
no one is following you
stay still
you are safe here
shh
you are safe
there was
nothing to animate
the drooping spirits
of the army
but the example
of their general
who endured even more
than the common
soldiers did
that was written about me
about my conquests
of armenia
whose future paetus
now holds in the
in the palm
of his grubby little hand
when our long
arduous march
took us through
hot desolate
and rugged countryside
with food
and water scarce
and the armenians
likely to launch
an obstinate defense
do you know what i did
i executed vadandus
one of the nobles
i had captured
and i cut off
his fucking head
and then i took his head
and i put it in
the ballista
and i sent it catapulting
into the enemy
fortifications
and they took it as a
a portent
they hastened to surrender
that a true story
would you have had
the wiles to act as i have
no
only a true soldier
has such an imagination
ah
you are awake
how long was i out
almost a day
a day
i really must
go yes
i heard a few mumblings
a name duria
tell me
from what do you run
bandits
other romans perhaps
did you desert
your legion
im no deserter
i too
was a soldier of rome
but that was
a long time ago
i have a mission
to complete
we each have
a mission to complete
where are you headed
soldier
to the euphrates frontier
i carry a message
for general corbulo
the lives of an entire
legion depend on my success
i see i am in the presence
of an uncommon man
did you come across
the mountains
from paetus encampment
yes
and where did you serve rome
in another life
a distant life
i served under
general vespasian in judea
vespasian
mm-hmm
but he was the only leader
capable of putting down
the jewish revolt
against nero
and his practice
of rewarding
and releasing his oldest
and most loyal
of soldiers is
well it known by all
he legendary sir
i would have very much
liked to have served under
such a great general
now i serve a great king
i do not understand
come
drink and eat
you need to regain
your strength
i know this country well
your destination
is not far
the most direct route
is across a span of desert
that lies between here
and the euphrates river
i recommend staying out
of the sun
if you can
and stick to
the dry river gullies
perhaps not the most direct
route across the desert but
they will protect you
sir without knowing it
youve not only
saved my life
but the lives
of an entire legion
i am forever in your debt
do not thank me
i would do this
for any man
roman persian scythian
im glad im the only one
to hear you say this
it could be your death sentence
for betrayal against rome
in the name of rome
i killed many men
now in my wildest
nightmares i recall
how sometimes
i even enjoyed it
but i was the one
who died
enemies
no
men
in truth
all of them equal
all of them
children of god
equal
and how may i ask
did you return to life
after being dead
by listening to the words
of a crucified man
you should not speak
this way to anyone
least of all
a roman soldier
are you not aware
that nero has sentenced
all christians to death
i no longer fear anything
not death
and least of all nero
without fear
we are free
would you still be free
in a prison cell
condemned to the gallows
or in the coliseum
facing wild beasts
more free than ever
and you do you not
want to be free
well
well as strange
as it may sound sir
these last few days
i think i felt freedom
for the first time
although i was pursued
by my enemies and
quickly chased down
and they were ready to kill me
ive never felt so alive
ive really reveled in these last few
days away from the army
then it may be that one day
you will know real freedom
like me
without killing
and perhaps someday
you will explain to me
this truth of yours
that makes all men equal
and free
but for now i must go
i am very grateful
for your help
saul
my name is saul
i am noreno
i packed
some provisions for you
you said that in life
we all have a mission
to complete
have you completed yours
no
wait
here
take this
god go with you soldier
you are a good man saul
i will not forget you
i dream that your
your precious fool
of a general
paetus is close
to surrender
his men are starving
his mercenaries
are deserting
the enemies of rome
have surrounded him
and have cut off
his supply of lines
emperor
had i led the legion
to reclaim armenia
for rome
we wouldve been
victorious by now
why hasnt he sent
for me for help
too proud
too vain
too stupid
yet i hear nothing
i hear nothing
do you emperor
nothing
no galloping hooves
no there no insistent
footsteps
no one no one has come
no one no one to help
not a single damn messenger
you ordered me here to
not to marshal my forces
unless paetus himself
sends word that i must
come to his aid
three legions are at risk
of annihilation
because of your poor judgment
and youve condemned your
most able general to wait
well im waiting
not good enough
get up
that the spirit
show me roman
youve done well
better than anyone
couldve imagined
but there comes a time
between hunter and prey when
they both know it must end
youre better than this
sand
im not done with you
have my fun get up
youre gonna tell me
who taught you how to run
that it
that the fight
im looking for
we each have
a mission to complete
do you not want to be free
your mission is over
i will give you
the sweet release of death
now tell me
what is your name
i like to know the names of
things im going to kill
do it
no
your life
is meaningless to me
now you end
this macabre chase
or i swear
itll be your last
permission to speak
general
well what do we have today
is it urgent
some of the patrolmen found a
legionnaire in the euphrates
he claims to be
one of paetus men
wow
paetus
well he must be a deserter
it doesnt seem
to be the case
he says he a messenger
paetus dares
to send me a messenger
where the fuck is he
outside waiting
he was armed only
with this
he insists that he alone
will hand you the message
make him come in
what your name soldier
legionnaire quintus
laberius surus
second cohort
fourth scythia legion sir
i carry a message sir
from general paetus
to general corbulo
so youre bringing me
a message from paetus
yes sir
oh im sorry
but youve come here
for nothing
valerius see to it
that this man eats well
and reward his efforts
no no dont
please sir
you must help us
ill not allow that tone
soldier
that useless
fucking paetus
the situation
is all his fault
settling on such
a mountainous area
so goddamned
easy to attack
but sir
wont you do it
for the soldiers sake
they have no fault
in the poor decisions
of their general
who do you think you are
talking to me like that
you speak insolently
yes
youre right
the general bad decisions
are not the men fault
that what war is like
im not gonna help paetus
valerius
come on
no
im sorry soldier
why wont he help us
thousands of my men
will die
oh what is it amariah
what have i done now
i gather youve heard
my reply
to the messenger
didnt you
i have told you
that business of rome
is not my concern
yes you have
especially as i am
your mistress
not your wife
especially as
im not roman-born
amariah
although
i was not born here
but this is my country
your country
which is a claim
of the state of rome
that should unite us
not divide us
well all right
it true
ive refused
general paetus
plea for help
and ive sent
his messenger back
on his way empty-handed
my orders from emperor nero
are clear
im to remain here on
the banks of the euphrates
to safeground the
syria on behalf of rome
i do
not understand you gnaeus
for weeks you prowled the halls
of this palace at night
sleepless agitated
awaiting general paetus
to swallow his pride
and ask for your help
no
beg for your help
then when he finally does so
there no glory in arriving
too late amariah
oh
the young soldier boy
he should be admired
i mean look at the distance
that he traveled all alone
through no-man-land
wilderness
amuck with cutthroats
and parthian assassins
poor guy
went over mountains
through forests
across desert land
it astonishing
that he managed
to make it at all
he was desperate
no
he a soldier
in service to rome
he fulfilled his duty
i have been
always impressed
by the willpower
certain men exhibit
when faced
with an impossible mission
well which is why history
will be remembered
such as generals
as great men
generals
im talking about
simple soldiers
like that messenger
who you dismissed
without a second thought
he did his duty
you have told me many times
of how you above all
the other generals
particularly paetus
appreciated the value
of good soldiers
and without them
and their stalwart strength
even the most
best military commanders
would have no chance
of victory
are you saying
i risk being forgotten
because i didnt come
to the aid of a general
who no better than a cur
no my darling
your place in history
is more than guaranteed
in your celebrated single-handed
military victories
general paetus
cannot fall further
in esteem
than he already has
he humiliated himself
in front of his men
and most importantly
in the eyes
of the roman emperor
but if he dies
all alone in mountains
of armenia
then good riddance
if he dies holed up
in the barren cold
under vicious attack
besieged
possibly fighting
for his life
with his last breath
no that unlikely
there always
the possibility
he will become a martyr
even a posthumous hero
paetus
a hero
yes
a martyr hero
who gave his life for rome
legends my love
do not necessarily rise
from the facts of an event
but from the most romanticized
version of a story
the story that people
most wanted to hear
the hero they wanted
to believe in
oh well
what would you have me do
deny paetus
his immortality
march to his aid
do not grant him
a martyr death
if paetus returns
to rome
hell continue
his campaign to slander me
and the fucker
has the emperor ear
slander the man
who rescued him
uh-huh
his savior
the general
who liberated him
from the jaws
of a certain death
no
not even paetus
is that stupid
and of me
what will be whispered
about me behind my back
they will say
there goes
the great and honorable
general corbulo
who was so moved
by the courage
of a single soldier
a messenger
who weathered
an impossible journey
to plead for help
my advice to you general
is to praise this faithful
servant of rome
say nothing of paetus
instead
speak in complimentary terms
of unsung heroes
do this
the legions will love you
no one will speak
a bad word against you
you have condemned
your political rival
in a life sentence
of public gratitude
of singing your praises
through clenched teeth
are you sure
youre not secretly
roman-born amariah
you speak with the wisdom
of one with intimate knowledge
of this political
machinations of the capital
politics are the same
everywhere
as is the quest for power
internal and universal
the only thing
that ever changes
is the names of those
who wield the scepter
or the sword
go
go
valerius
summon the tribunes
i want to see them immediately
the troops must be ready
to march at dawn
congratulations soldier
do you know
what youre going to do now
well im going to return
to armenia
youre gonna go back
but your mission
was a success
yes
but when i was
on my way here
i met a man
and he said to me
that in life
we all have a mission
that needs to be fulfilled
and i feel like i still
havent fulfilled mine
and id like to think
that maybe
somewhere out there
there a woman
waiting for me
and i can live a life
in peace
well
may the gods help you
in your new life soldier

good citizensof westerville
i come to you this dayas our nation is on the
precipice of war
now some of you here ifought with 5 years ago
in the war with mexico
i commanded you then buti come to you today not as
your officer butas your neighbor
your friend andfellow patriot
our nation is endangeredby the same imperialism as
it was when we marchedthrough texas
will we do no less whenthat danger is on
our very soil
applause
ladies and gentlemenwelcome with me now
bishop william hanby
applause
as many of you knowprior to my founding the
otterbein collegei traveled over 4000
miles on thecircuit in one year
during my travels i sawmuch injustice and hate
it has made me a man ofstrong convictions
and i founded thecollege to serve others
and it included within itswalls men and women
of all races
i have made my voice knownand shown my scorn for
injustice and i willcontinue to stand against
any law that makes it afelony to give food to a
hungry slave or be friendprecious men women
and children whodeserve freedom
the fugitive slave lawof 850 is inhumane
it is absurd that givingshelter to a friendless
man woman orchild is a crime
we may be boundby a man made law
but we are more bound bya lord-given conscience
ohio has alwaysbeen a free state
it was the first statein the union to outlaw
slavery in itsconstitution
we should stand as boldas the writers
of that constitution
today many of you willjoin the union army
and you shallbe that bold
may god bless you as youmake your choice to stand
for the freedom of all
how can a christianminister stand on that
platform and support thebreaking of the law
especially a law thatprotects the property
of a person
a human being cannot besomeone property
when a man-made law isin conflict with god
law there isno compromise
we choose oneway or the other
you are nothing buta freedom crusader
it says injoshua 245
choose you this daywhom you shall serve
as for me and my housewe shall serve the lord

where haveyou two been
you both misseddinner and lizzie
you have strawon your clothes
we helped them jennie
girls wherehave you been
ruth you have strawon your clothes
we helped them mother
helped who
obviously youve beenout helping runaways again
yes but i went out andfound her and she fine
she led the runaways tothe barn and give them
food and water
yes and itwas exciting
was it
it was wonderful
yes but the bountyhunter has made helping
the runaways evenmore dangerous
as excitingas it may be
and as much as we allbelieve in our cause
it simply too dangerousfor you to be running
around in the woods
especially with thebounty hunter in the area
besides thatfather job ruth
and clearly theretoo much of him in you
the bible says thatruth was born for
such a time as this
lizzie thatwas esther
but that goesfor me too right
what can i say to this
dear emeryas i write you
i sit outside my tent in camp
i am happy to be here with my cousin reed
and i am very happy you are at home with liza
i have established friendships with several
other men as well
their names are john billings daniel lewis
isaac griffith and jacob wolf
i suspect that we shall all remain close
throughout the struggle ahead
we have made ourselves at home and as i settled in
i think of mother and father
i smile when i remember how excited they were
about the free soil party and how proud i think they
would be that i am fighting for the cause
i can still hear them arguing with dull faces
that free men on free sale made for a morally and
financially better way than the way of slavery
i remember when mother called them weak timid
half-baked men
i think being here makes a person sentimental
of fond memories
i think of how our family once had been as i look
into the faces of these men of courage
i can see lizaface as well
that sweet smile of mysister warms me as i think
of myself and all of thesemen preparing for the
battles thatlie before us
we have set up camp near the b and o railroad
and i have found that the 4th ohio is
filled with great men
at this point were so confident that we feel we
could single handedly defeat the entire
confederate army
stay safe and true to the cause your brother clay
talia what areyou doing here
did you escape onlyto be caught again
i will not let mysisters be
taken to kentuckywhere nellie

dalin wright
emery
what are youdoing out here
i heard shots and ithought someone needed her
what are youdoing out here

they sounded like theycame from a revolver
no i saw a man with arevolver run south
to the woods
he was shorter than mewith light colored hair
well stay safe then
you the same emery
and try not toshoot me next time
oh i will try
girls giggling
i am so excited to behaving this special
tea party with all ofyou for breakfast
anyone for tea
yes please
oh yes
yes please
what do you thinkabout last night
i think if there abounty hunter around here
we should findout who it is
you think weshould find out
yes it is aperfect plan
a bounty hunter wouldnever expect a
group of girls to belooking for him
i would notexpect it either
i think itis a great idea
we should getstarted right away
and i have experiencein this area
once i caught johnnytaking an apple from
miss audrey orchardbehind her house
there a bigdifference between a boy
taking an apple and a manin the woods with a gun
very goodclarissa-bell
the first clue
the bountyhunter has a gun
i think we knew that
yes what men intown have a gun
seriously
pretty muchall of them
let go into the woods
and begin lookingfor clues now
yes
let us all go runaround the woods in
our nice dresses andlook for clues
any ideas
maybe we should splitup and two of us go
in that direction
maybe you andjulianna head that way
so ill go with ruth
and liza will gowith julianna
we need a signal
my brothers usuallywhistle loudly
who herewhistles loudly
i guess i can
let hear
screaming
silence
perhaps we should justyell for one another
clarissa-belllook at this
i will bethere shortly
hurry hurry
it looks like arope and scarf
i am sure it a clue
it looks rather dirty
yes it does
ruth youre gettingyour drawers dirty
how can you careabout drawers
at a time like this
*
hello girls didyou find any clues
i think we did
we found thisrope and scarf
whered you find that
it was beside atree in the woods
so i got down andpicked it up
so let me guess yougot your drawers dirty
yes sheabsolutely did
yes but i thinkwere much closer to
finding out who thebounty hunter is
and i suppose weregoing to continue
until we find him
i know thisis a good thing
well be cautious
and well always tell youtwo what we are up to
and your brothers too
remember that is the deal
yes our brothers
and remember lizabrother will help too
i have no brothers
you can have mine
laughing
dear bishop hanby thank you for showing me
the meaning of faithfulness
i have watched your uncompromised stand to god
and for what you believe
your family has been faithful to emery
liza and me
i will fight for freedom and above all be faithful
to the lord who is faithful to me
i want you to know that i intend on being faithful
to this noble cause
i promise to defend my country against treason
and conspiracies and to vindicate honor to our
glorious stripes and stars
the last few days have been days
that ill never forget
weve been marching without pause toward
philippi virginia
the men were exhausted and in want for water
food and rest
even then the 4th are ready to fight
we knew and hoped that we would smell
gunpowder soon
scouts were sent out regularly
my cousin reed and i were honored to be
chosen for such a mission
quietly
quiet quiet quiet
quiet boys
quiet
come on quiet
quiet boys
quiet
the enemy could be justdown over there and we
dont want them knowingwere here do we
okay clay reed jacobi want you to go down
this road here easealong the woods
see if you can seethe enemy down there
go ahead and take off yourhaversacks and canteens
i dont want nothingclanging around
all right if you guyssee anything down there
send one of youback to report
the other two just keepan eye on them okay
let go
be cautious
keep your eyes down
we scouted ten miles that night and never saw
any rebels however we did see
where they had burned bridges
there was only the reflection of water where
they had once stood
i ask that you follow me and my company
with your prayers
pray that i am an example of patriotism
that if we should need reinforcements
i may inspire others to enroll as faithful
defenders of the union
we in the 4th ohio volunteers have pledged
ourselves to a no more noble sacrifice than to
further peace for all men no matter their color
and for our government enduring honor
i must now close as my regimen has been told
to remove all that is encombering us
were making a large pile of napsacks haversacks
blankets and all our articles so we can move
on in double quick time
we should arrive near philippi at daybreak
my best to you and your family
yours clay
we need to rememberclay in our prayers

israel was caught inslavery for hundreds of
years and walked inthe desert away
from the promise

john parkeris a wanted man
and we who are withhim are just as
valuable to him
$000 dollars
who has that much money
im sure the localslave owners
have gotten together
it doesny saywhere to take them
the bounty hunterswouldnt know where to
take any of us
then why post flyers
to use fear as aweapon to stop us
gunfire in distance
sounds like somebodyout here besides us

ill distract thebounty hunters and
you help the runaway
where the north star

my brother emery i have just finished
fighting in the battle of philippi
i could hear your voice encourage me
after leaving behind much of our gear
we marched on to philippi in double time
there was a woman favoring the rebs
that spotted us and fired a pistol at us
this started our cannon fire
as we advanced on the town those rebs
were not ready for us
it was a site of victory
the confederates were asleep from the effect of
their whiskey and the convincing tones of
our artillery finally awakened them
to their perilous situation
the rebs began running from their tents
as they attempted to dress
dont worry aboutyour fancy stuff boys
grab your guns and go
the yankees are coming
come on boys come on
the value of the spoil was amazing
it was quite a contrast as before this we had
nothing to eat but hard bread and raw ham
now the camp is filled with activity
food and laughter although were dealing with picket
fire nightly and ready for more battles ahead
im finding that my time with the 4th ohio
has changed me
i know im a more noble man
i know i will stand strong in the next battle
that lies ahead
your brother clay
that it
what do you think
it was a veryinteresting story
yes it was
im sure the graybacks wont always
be so foolish
there will be strugglesahead without a doubt
and you need to go
yes i do
i cant sit hereany longer while
clay is out there
this is everythingthat clay and i have
it will be enough tohelp you take care
of liza for a long time
emery youdont have to
yes i do
how will youget to clay
i know a chaplain whois going to meet
the 4th ohio tomorrow
im going with him
okay so we need to goover what we know now
well we havea rope and scarf
i took the scarfto the general store
mrs young said thatit is a fabric
and pattern they sell
did you ask her whoshe had sold it to
yes and she couldntremember exactly
however they were allpeople she knew from town
did she havereceipts of the sales
oh yes but she told mei shouldnt be so nosey
what about the rope
not at thegeneral store
i checked at the horsestable in town
there nothing like it
i checked the baker andblacksmith and did not
see anything like it
you checkedthe blacksmith
yes he seemed tothink it odd i was so
interested in his work
well we need tofind this rope in town
there has to be moreof it somewhere
i heard emery tell willthat the gun that was
fired in the woodswas a revolver
he said there werent toomany people in town
who own revolvers
that good to know
i think we shouldfollow the money
what do you mean
someone in town shouldhave a lot more money
that true
there are reports of fourrunaways being caught
maybe we shouldcheck with the bank
i dont think mr ripinat the bank will help us
we need to keep a lookoutfor a man with a new
wagon or clothes orsomething that shows
he got money
are you okay julianna
oh yes i justhad an idea
i will look into it later
good day annawill adin

i think so
tonight we should moveback where the bounty
hunter caught the girl
we should pray for aclear sky and full moon
so we can see well
yes
i was taught to trust inthe lord and that is
what we are gonna do
my mama told me a storyabout a runaway named
liza liza came thisway in the cold of winter
with a baby
she got to the edge of theriver and heard the dogs
barking behind her
she saw the light at thetop of liberty hill
there was no boat
so she stepped across theice jumping from patch to
patch all the way acrossthe river to freedom
that is an amazingstory molly
she made it acrossthe river estelle
and so are we
yes
were gonna get acrossthat river molly
but now we have to sleep
we have to runagain at dark
go ahead
i will take first watch
i am too excited to sleep
very well
it raining butit still sunny
how does that happen
well when the rainclouds arent big enough
to cover the sun
kind of likehard times huh
they arent bigenough to cover hope
yes lizajust like that
we received our firstletter from emery
shall we read it
yes
our dear sister liza and our dear friend audrey
i am here with clay now
we are both doing well and are healthy
earlier today i experienced my first action
it was a squirmish in the field against some rebs
gunfire
dramattic music
gunfire continues
get your head down

is this whatit like corporal
i thought wed befighting standing up
this is squirmishing
youre out front keepingan eye on what the
rebels are getting at
now keep your eye onthose cavalry out there
you see themget ready to run
okay
get up get upget up come on
okay
let go
shortly after the squirmish
the rains began and have not stopped since
the close companion to the rain is the mud and
someplaces ankle deep
our army issued clothing becomes so heavy with
water it nearly drags us to the ground
we can hear cannons in the distance
it is a small comfort to be safe in our tents but
i cannot help but feel for our comrades who have
pressed on to the battle at ridge mountain
is it raining whilethe sun shines there too
miss audrey
i dont think so liza
hey
fire

miss you liza yet we both know this is where we
are meant to be
continue with audrey to be brave as we stand together
in the savior love a love that demands that all
men are created equal on this earth
we can do nothing more for this cause my dear
liza than to stand courageously through the
fight for the rights of others
i know you and miss audrey are doing the same
as we are away
be brave little sister
our love to you both your brothers emery and clay

because all ofthis was in his room
i should have known
it all makes sense now
new hat nice food
all the new clothes
he promised he wasntstealing but i never
thought of this
it not yourfault julianna
it was right undermy nose the whole time
no julianna
you cannot think that way
your brother madehis own decisions
you never couldhave stopped him
wait a minute
a $500 rewardfor talia edmondson
this is lottie

if he doeswere in trouble

music
make way let me pass
please let the girl go
youre in noposition to stop me
im within the law
dalin whatare you doing
come no closer bishop
let me pass
there no rewardin it if you shoot her
im merelyobeying the law
it is you whois breaking it
yes dalin
i am breaking the law
a law that is a stain onthe soul of this nation
but look at yourself
you hold within your handthe life of another
is that withinyour rights
move out ofmy way bishop
im turning this fugitiveinto the authorities
i will notlet you take her
dalin
julianna
julianna what areyou doing here
how could you
youre my brother
juliannawe needed the money
not that kind of money
we had to eat
i would eat dirt beforei ate the food of bondage
how can you say that
youre in bondage toyour own wants your own
self your own pride
father --
father set free everyslaved we owned
yes and he left us
he left us with nothing
and youre justas greedy as he was
youre in more bondagethan any slave
how can you say that
because the bondage yourein runs deep to the soul
i will pray for youdalin but if you continue
this i will neverspeak to you again
julianna
julianna
julianna
dalin it is time foryou to stop reproaching
the person of freedom
freedom is no person
on the contrary theperson of freedom is the
light that will set youfree from the bondage of
yourself and thebondage of greed
bishop idont understand
there was a man whotook men women and
children into bondage andled them to slaughter
oh he acted within thelaw but it was on the road
to damascus that he felland saw the light the
light of freedom

are you molly
yes i am
ill be right back
samuel
can you bring some morefire wood out to the cabin
i just haveone more step

no samuel
just take some firewood to the cabin
the stairs can wait
music
samuel
samuel i made it
i knew you would
god is good
yes he is
music
what brings youto my home today
ive come to tell youthat i have not informed
anyone of the undergroundrailroad which you run
from your home sir
all we do from ourhome dalin is as the
lord leads andlove commands
i want tothank you sir
thank me
in all honesty itbecause of julianna that
youre evenhere right now
it is because ofjulianna and you sir
that i have changed
i know that iam a new man
how are we toknow the same
because of a man namedpaul in the book of acts
please let me read
then ananias answeredlord i have heard by many
of this man of theevil that he has done
he has the authority fromthe chief priests to bind all
and the lord said unto him gothy way for he is a chosen
vessel unto me
i am that man
yes
you have taken a riskfor the lives of others
you know my reputation
you know what hurti have brought
yet you sit here becauseof the lives of so many
because that is the kindof man that you are
dalin as someone whopaid for his own freedom
from a wicked man i knowthe meaning of captivity
i walked many a mile formy freedom only to walk
back again and spend timein jail until i paid for it
then you understand howgod can get a hold of a
man for a greater purpose
i also understand thatthings that appear to be a
risk arent a risk atall when seen through
the eyes of faith
it is my prayer thatyou will trust me
once again sir
and if not i will dowhatever you ask to again
earn that trust
i want to join theunderground railroad
just as the slave traderjohn newton came to
realize his needi have also
well --

just let me finish thisletter to bishop hanby
okay
dear bishop hanby clay and i have returned to
camp and are now rested from the most intense
battle i have fought since my recruitment it was the
battle of corrick ford
it all began in the early morning of july 3
we had marched about 8 miles the night before and
had set up camp in the woods
we had no tents and had not eaten
get moving time to get up
conrad get your men up
get them moving get them fed
come on let go
everybody up come ongotta move out
let go time to go up
come on everybody get up
get some food in youwe got to go
come on boys right now
let get movinggotta move out
too early
everybody up come on we gotta move out
at 3 oclock in the morning we were awakened
and given just a moment to quickly eat our hardtack
here
thanks
what going on
i have no idea
let go boys
has anything likethis happened before
not sinceive been here
it going to beall right though
im worried
im worried
it will be fine
better hurry boys
were going to fallin any moment now
already
company c fall in
music
attention company
shoulder arms
left face
forward march
men who moments before were asleep and hungry now
began marching like soldiers with
determination in their faces ready to face
whatever was ahead
we marched at such a rapid pace that by  oclock
that afternoon we caught up with the gray back
rear guard
they were cavalry and after a short exchange of
gunfire they scattered quicker than my chickens
back home
by 2 oclock we had reached the chief river
after fording the river we received word from
skirmishers of a line of rebs waiting to ambush us
we volleyed three rounds in their direction
ready
aim
fire
fall back
fall back boys
fall back
yelling
the rebels took off running for their lives
after pursuing them for a mile and fording the river
again we found them formed in a line of battle
company ready
aim
fire
gunshots
fire
gunshots
ready
aim
fire
gunshots
we were met with musket fire we returned fire and
called out or 6 pound canon to answer them
the gray backs fled again double quick time led by
their cavalry
what happened next was unexpected
without warning we were fired upon by the rebs
gunfire
steady boys
the almighty has blessed usand the rebel aim was high
now well giveit back to them
ready
aim
fire
gunshots
load
by the grace of god the rebs had aimed high
and missed
we relentlessly fought the rebs for 37 minutes
we were given the command to advance and the
confederates began retreating
music
come on boys
come on
music
gunfire
music
all that remained were ten rebs and an officer
hold on boys
well fight them here
stand strong men
fire at will
gunfire
it no use
surrender boys
five rebels and the officer were hit
five other gray backs surrendered
the victory was joyous but it did not come without
great loss for both sides
as we approach the confederate line there was
no celebrating
only the stark realization of the great price that
must be paid for this great country
look here boys
an officer
it notjust an officer
it a general
that boys isgeneral robert garnett
i knew him at west point
we were cadets together
he a fine soldier
it a shame tosee him gone
our sergeantbeen hit
our sergeant been hit
sarge ant reicheldeifer
are you sure
yes he was hit withartillery fire on the
other side of the river
can they save him
there was nothingto be done emery
he gone
music
the men that have fought beside me are
strong and loyal
i could not have asked for better brothers in this
noble fight
god is carrying us through and like them i
will be reenlisting in the army and will not be
coming home after my 90 days of service are over
i know this comes as no surprise to you
may we continue together in the cause as we move
forward for the lives of those in bondage
god bless you all
emery
music
would you like to hear this letter from clay
yes i would love to father
dear bishop hanby after celebrating the
surrender of general johnston troops the
4th ovi had marched from richmond virginia
to washington
news of the war being over has brought to me
mixed emotions
there has been victory and much loss
the mixed emotions are made stronger while here
in our nation capitol after president
lincoln death
hey emery haveyou seen my sack
no reed
the war is over and nowyou lose your sack
it probably in here
i have heard that the 4th will be moving to
louisville kentucky in the next few months
we believe we will be sent home shortly after
arriving to louisville
i look forward to being home again
sharing a tent for four years with emery has been
an experience
found it
goodbye thanksfor your help
laughter
lives given by those who have fought in battle
will be seeds that produce a great harvest of freedom
what the future holds for us at home is to continue
to help all men of all colors to experience the
promise of life hope and a future together just as
god has intended
we return to a new day
we have won the fight for the freedom of those who
are enslaved and the underground railroad no
longer needs to exist
we shall not only see our nation as one again but we
shall see those who have lived by the fruit of
hope live free to pursue happiness as men
we have written a letter telling liza and audrey we
are on our way
please be sure they have received it
we look forward to supporting you in the next
fight whatever it may be
we will be back in westerville soon
emery and clay dalton

jake mom
check this outwhat the bible
no i found a noteinside of it
july 4 998
today im writingthis to let whomeverfinds this letter
know that itin my possession
i have a small wooden box
that is filled with some sort of something
that is beyond my comprehension
you see the boxcontains nothing
yet it feels likesomething is in it
when i open the box i immediately get a very peaceful
and beautiful feeling
you might thinkim crazy
but this box is connectedto someone called holy
it a feeling that i cant describe
when i open the boxi see jesus hangingon the cross
i can see a young man holding this very box and crying
while he watching jesus being crucified
i cant help but thinkof my jake when i getthis feeling
im not sure but i believe this box is meant to be in jake possession
carry out something that only he is meant to
i know that jakewill find this box
just at the timehe needs it
to fulfill whateverhe has been calledto do
jake what do youthink this means
grandpa felt and sawwhat i feel and see
what if grandpawas right
what if imsupposed to do somethingwith the box
but what
he never saidwhere he found it
what if someonegave it to him
what if grandpa foundthe box where i found it
what if he left it thereso i would find it
someone called holy
what does thateven mean
okay there isan explanationfor all of this
there has to be
you told methat grandpa always talked
about peoplethat came into his shop
do you rememberanything about somebody
that gave himthe box

now let go playthat boxing gameover there
the box
what box
the box that jake had
that richie picked upoff the ground
remember whenthey fought at the schoolthe other day
yeah what about it
well that nightrichie told me something
it was reallybothering him
he said thatwhen he opened the box
something cameover him
somethingpeaceful
that crazy man
i dont knowwhat that means
but somethingtells me that we needto go find jake
well do you knowwhere to find him
no there waysto find him
let go
man i still dont knowwhat that little boxcan do for richie
did he ever mentionwhat was in the box
he always saidhe felt like the box
held somethingspecial inside
although he nevercould find it
and you know the box
the box hadsome weight to it
i bet you twodont know this
your grandfathertook care
of a homeless manfor a while
hed come in hereand hed get his meals
and your grandfatherwould pay for it
he even let him stayin the back of his storefor a few weeks
i bet you didntknow that maggie
nope
anyway the first timei saw that box
was shortly afterholy disappeared
so i alwaysjust believed
holy gave himthe box
he never mentionedanything like thatto me
although i guessit because i probablywould have told dad
to makethe homeless manleave the shop
huh well ill be
he was right
there is somethingin there
what is it
i dont know
i think itsome kind of nail
may i
you knowjust a few months
before your grandpapassed
he told me he wasgoing to hide the boxin the store
chuckles and that if youhad anything
to do with it jake
you would findthe box
and he believed
somehowthe box would end upin your hands
at justthe right time
you mentioned holy
was that the homelessguy name
he saidhe was knownas holy
holylike god holy
or holey likeholey clothes
when your grandfathertold me he was gonna
let this guystay in his shop
i did my researchi went around
and i askeda lot of questions
and everyone i askedsaid he was harmless
just a kind old man
hey mom do youknow how jesus
was nailedto the cross
well he diedso that you and icould have life

through his handsor his wrists

hi mr kane
im sorry to barge in sir
but id like you to meet
my partner
detective katie coltrane
nice to meet you
nice tomeet you
we have something wonderful
to show you
guppies
ice fish
theyre remarkable creatures
they live in our polar oceans
in water so cold
no other organism can survive
they possess an enzyme which
ive isolated and reproduced
because of it
ice fish can be trapped
and frozen in ice for years
brought back to life again
after injecting a serum
from the ice fish
into a subject blood
they can be frozen and
reanimated whenever you like
that just peachy but we are
not here for a social call
-i liked the fish
-come on
no need to take an attitude
ill try to remember that
were here because
someone gave oliver rex
and a clone named adam
a new cosmic address
is there--is there something
we can do to help
well according to his roommate
oliver worked here
and the dead clone
was registered to you
adam worked in species data
with oliver
-species data
-i collect endangered species
we try to rescue
the last specimen when we can
and keep them here
at my compound
thank you for letting us know
youre so very welcome but
i do have one more thing to ask
isnt it a little strange
to you
that both these guys were made
extinct on the same night
and they both
just happened to work for you
it strikes me as tragic
im sorry officers
im sorry i cant be
of more help to you
-thank you
-thank you for your time
thank you good-bye
good-bye and i really
enjoyed seeing the fishes
-let go
-excuse me coming

who from the beginning
to the end
was our friend
listen where the body
he was liquefied
what do you mean he was
liquefied--like a smoothie

his essence
fertilizes the flowers
so that each guest
can take some home

warning against what
also they affect the electrical things
they affect the lights and the
phones they they affect things
billy stop
youre not making sense
just tell me what happened
what i am telling you
they cant be in the light
they hide in the
dark so you cant see them
i mean ive been
doing research and reading
and i dont think im alone

his writing dark and hopeless
and he went crazy too
i dont know
what youre talking about
well of course you dont i have
to work nights so i can sleep days
my own fucking mother has to look

nobody can help me
im going to help you
no you cant
i shouldnt have called you
no you did the right thing

paul
paul
paul
paul
julia julia
julia stop
julia
julia stop
hey listen im not going to hurt you
im going to stay right here
honey listen hey
hey there nothing to be afraid of
how did i get here
you must have been sleepwalking
it nice to see
someone else born after 950
hey
so how did you know billy
we were friends since we were kids
im julia
right yeah um
billy talked a lot about you
um im sam
this this is my roommate
terry hi
hi
billy sam and i
were really close in college
yeah
you were with him werent you
the night that he
yeah
im sorry
did he say anything to you
nothing i could understand
it was all pretty incoherent
sort of like
maybe he was on something again
you know he was taking prozac
i guess it didnt work
excuse me
what
hey
i just wanted to apologize for
sam comment back there
the guy engages his mouth
before his brain sometimes
it okay im just a little
over-sensitive right now
we all are
so had you
seen much of billy recently
yeah until he moved
back here about 3 months ago
do you know what he
was trying to tell us with all this
maybe he was planning
for a really long camping trip
or that he was afraid of the dark
i know that feeling
you had night terrors as a kid right
did billy tell you that
yeah for a while
that was all he could talk about
in fact it is the reason
that him and sam and i met
we all hadem
what
it crazy huh
see we all got
really close freshman year
but it was only later that billy
told us he had sought us out
he was obsessed back then
and what about lately
hed come to me
recently a few times
babbling about how
we shared the same problem
how we need to stay in the light
i guess i shouldve
taken him more seriously
but i was so used
to billy acting crazy you know
it never occurred to me that
the same thing could happen to us
you are the string days collected
like tiny silk beads
and counted before sleeping
julia
hey baby welcome home
are you drunk
i prefer intoxicated
come on
im just having a couple of drinks
what with all the hostility
i had an accident
what
on the way home i had an accident
are you hurt
no
okay tell me what happened
i was driving out
in the middle of nowhere and
i thought something
ran out in front of me
so i had to slam on the brakes and
i nearly went off the road
did you hit the omething
i dont know
i dont think so
i thought i saw what
im just not
exactly sure what happened
okay well was it an animal
i dont think so
okay so whatd you hit an alien
i should have known
i should have known
oh hey
no i should have known
what do you want me to say
that you would make fun of me
i dont know
i just know
that something scared me
ive got my defense
the day after tomorrow
i just dont need to come home and
find you getting wasted
with your idiot roommates
look let me
tell you what ive been up to
there was a thirteen car pile-up
on the 80 last night
so for the past 24 hours ive been
cutting dead people out of their cars
there a difference between what
youve been through
and what ive been through
yours is in there
mine out here
dont get confused
about which is which
billy must have been writing
in this diary since childhood
so we thought you might
want to take a look at it
maybe you can make more
sense out of it than we could
it pretty deranged stuff
like this
saw them again
beneath my window in the alley
always in darkness and shadow
where do they come from
could it be that darkness
is their way in and out
origins incubus
bringers of nightmares
grendels lurking in the darkness
can only assume
that light is my savior
maybe it all in my head
the insane nightmare of a schizo
you dont seem
surprised by any of this
it a lot like the stuff he talked
about the night he died
it not too surprising that
he would write about it too
no i guess not it just that
we were wondering if
what
if youve had any
recent night terrors
yeah actually i have
us too
ever since billy killed himself
ive had this uneasy feeling
you know like im being
watched or something
i mean im 24 years
old and i walk in a dark room
and it like im 5 again
cmon you guys
weve all been through an
extremely traumatic experience
it only natural that
certain uncomfortable feelings
would be stirred up
you dont remember
remember what
how powerful those feelings were
what do you mean
when i was five
i watched my sister drown in a lake
where we used to spend our summers
right after i started to suffer
from terrible night terrors
there was one particularly bad night
i woke up screaming my head off
my parents finally
managed to get me to sleep
and a couple of hours later my
mother came back to check on me
and i was gone
they looked everywhere
in the attic in the basement
all over the house
my mother was hysterical
she thought id been kidnapped
or id run off or who knows what
then my father
went into the backyard
and he heard a noise in
the doghouse of all places
he stooped down looked in
and there i was huddled in the back
naturally he reached in and
that when i stabbed him in the eye
with a kitchen knife
i was convinced
he wasnt my father
that he was some
kind of demon coming for me
i was absolutely sure of it
i havent had that
feeling since i was a kid
but i have it now
and so does sam and
we thought you might too
julia
yes dr booth
i hardly recognize you
in fact i dont recognize you at all
but come on in
it hard to think of you
as that frightened little girl
who used to come in here
my god it been what
twenty years
twenty years
it a wonder im still around
so what have
you been doing with yourself
well actually im going
for my masters in psychology
psychology that wonderful
now tell me outside of studying
how are you doing
im not doing that well dr booth
that why i came to see you
i havent been sleeping that well
i think i had a recurrence
a recurrence of what
night terrors
what makes you say that
a few nights ago i woke up
in my bathroom totally disoriented
my boyfriend came to
help me and i attacked him
well it certainly
sounds like a night terror
it not unheard of in adults
but really quite abnormal
yes that right
night terrors can be part
of normal childhood development
but ive found that the most violent
and persistent cases
occur in children whove suffered
profound emotional trauma
if i recall you
came to see me shortly after
your father took his
own life isnt that right
yes
so your recent night terror
could possibly have been triggered
by an increase in stress or fatigue
am i far off
no no
julia why dont we schedule
a formal session
i dont usually treat adults
but since we have a history
you could come in here describe
the things youre going through
and well try to figure out
if it really is a recurrence
of night terrors
or if it something else
you scared the hell out of me
sorry
what do you think went through
billy mind when he did it
the bullet
i dont know terry the same thing
that goes through everybody mind
before they kill themselves
that they hate their life;
theyre better off dead than alive
blam blam blam
i wonder what it
like to get to that place
terry stop picking it
or it never going to heal okay
it not healing anyway i might
as well get some satisfaction
i think it getting worse
maybe it cancer
there is something seriously demented
about you do you know that
you know maybe
i shouldve gone to law school
like i said demented
look im going to go out
try to detox for a little bit
are you going
to be alright by yourself
yeah
sure
yeah
okay bye
got you
damn rats
understanding your child dreams
hello
hey julia how goes it
lousy
im still on chapter four in crowley
and i cant remember half the other
sources in my bibliography
well look at the bright side
if you flunk it only another 2
months of hell and another 20 grand
but it could be worse
how
im not sure exactly
hey listen kim will you call me later
make sure im still awake
okay bye
thanks bye
state mental health association
experiencing emotional difficulty
paranoid delusion
subject claims demon
could somebody turn
the lights back on please
hello
open the door
please somebody help me
damn it
moore theory of discordance
postulates that subjects
when presented with evidence
hostile to their world view
experience
dissociative discordance
or fight or flight reflexivity
and discordance here is defined
as delusions of reality stemming
from childhood trauma
and a heightened
state of anxiety
yes sorry
by increasing the number of
familiar external stimuli
individuals will
well individuals will try
individuals experiencing
discordance will
would you please excuse me
yeah certainly
hey it julia
leave a message after the beep
julia come on
pick up i know youre there
im sorry about the other night
so consider this the official apology
besides i want to
hear how your defense went
i bet you knocked
em dead but i need specifics
so pick up the phone
alright i can take a hint
but im gonna harass you
until you call me back
hey it julia
leave a message after the beep
paul
hello
julia this is sam
oh hi
i need to talk to you
hello
hey it julia
yeah come on in
okay
hello
sam
depressing isnt it
look im sorry that i called you
i just figured that youd be the
only one that would understand
understand what
i mean you see it right
i dont know what i see
but you can feel it
you definitely feel that
something bad is happening right
yes
you see you do understand
terry missing
what do you mean missing
she didnt come home last night
the rec center
called me this morning
and they said that they found her
bag with all of her stuff in it
sam slow down maybe
maybe she just
forgot her stuff in her locker
and what left the
building in her bathing suit
did you call the police
yes i did
theyre not going to find anything
ive been studying billy diary
ever since we found it
you know i cant seem to do much
of anything else it like
sam
no wait wait just listen
okay now i cant make
sense of all of it but
i was taken to their world when i was
five and marked but it faded
they only mark kids
who have night terrors
listen to this
last week the mark reappeared
it means theyre coming for me
just listen to his last entry okay
i cant write much longer
the mark on my hand
keeps getting worse
i cant stand it
i pulled out
this thing they planted in me
sam billy was unstable
we know that
no
this is ridiculous
hed had problems since he was a kid
we all did
now dont you think it possible
that something that scared us as kids
has come back to collect us
what are you saying
i never saw billy mark
but i did see terry
and hers looked a lot like this
hi
hi
what your name
sarah
my name is julia
are you all by yourself
where your mom
heaven
do you work here
no
i dont either
im a patient
sarah do you have bad dreams
sometimes
what happens in your dreams
they come for me
who comes
they
why do they come for you
to eat me
does anything keep them away
lights
you think im crazy
no
why dont you tell me what
you think it all might mean
our night terrors may not have been
induced by emotional trauma at all
maybe something really did
come for us when we were kids
and planted something in us
and whatever it was it left a mark
just like that little girl
and now theyre coming back
yes and that why the marks
reappear so that they can find us
and take us back to the place in
our night terrors out of the light
i know how it sounds
julia you say you failed your thesis
defense with dr crowley
perhaps youd like to tackle this case
subject is suffering
post-traumatic stress
from witnessing the
suicide of a close friend
influenced by the erratic behavior
of two strangers
she allows herself to entertain
the paranoid schizophrenic delusions
of her dead friend
and why does she do that
because she feels
a sense of personal failure
and guilt that billy
that her friend died
and you are going to be
an excellent psychologist
ill see you on thursday
thank you dr booth
oh julia
if these demons were coming back
wouldnt you have the mark too
remind me what im looking for
like an infected mark-thing
little pinkish like the size of a dime
well nothing yet
but it early
paul this is serious
okay im sorry youre all done
no marks
you sure
double-checked trust me
not that im complaining you know
but whyd you need me to do that
i met these two friends
of billy at the funeral
and
well they both had marks like billy
and so i went to tell dr booth and
oh youre just
gonna think this is crazy
julia didnt we just search
your entire body and find nothing
so what have
you got to worry about
youre right
youre right
jesus
somebody
hey over here help
hey over here
come on
hey paulie were
going down to the
woah hello nurse

you mad
not mad im embarrassed
but ill get over it
troy may not however
im sorry about
the last couple of days
hey you feel dont apologize for it
good night
ill see you tomorrow
and all for less than a dollar
what do you think of that
you cant beat that kind of value
as the power shortage
reaches critical levels
residents are asked to save
energy and turn off the lights
in an effort to avoid more rolling
blackouts this weekend
and in a related story officials
say the rolling blackouts
will have an effect
on emergency services provided
in the largest metropolitan hospital
this comes as another blow to the
already beleaguered medical center
as eleventh-hour talks broke
down today between doctors
and hospital administration
hospital spokesperson
jason hildin
stated that the doctor strike
is a foregone conclusion
this is getting ridiculous
on the lighter side
of civic news
paul

i was doing a standard
monitor of the time continuum
just to make sure everything

weve gone down the line so many times
im surprised all of history
isnt out of whack
your history might be jack
take a look
when you left lena back
in old los angeles
she was pregnant with your daughter
when you met the child
lena let you believe
that someone else was the father
in order to spare your feelings
well i did a dna trace and she yours
otherwise you couldnt
be in her body right now
guess these time travel paradoxes
have finally gone
from the ridiculous to the sublime
not really
she in trouble or should
i say youre in trouble
last time i was here
i wiped out all the trancers
we dont know who or why
i grabbed these images from the time belt
and they show the girl
fighting for her life
if she loses then youre erased
i mean she exists in the past
or well right now
so eventually her descendants
will be your parents
congratulations jack
youve just fathered your own
great great great grandmother
jesus could you have
screwed this up anymore
i cant even get my brain around this
then think of it this way
someone is trying to kill your daughter

full reinstatement

of a meteor shower

everything checks
the meteor definitely came to earth
approximately 340 miles due south
but meteor showers do happen
some penetrate the atmosphere
well you know they do all the time
but only one in every 200 thousand
ever reaches a populated area
so it rare
but why is everybody so pissed off
well i dont know
what upsetting people
maybe the aliens have finally landed
wouldnt that be something
ive met em doc
theyre no great shakes
smell bad too
listen were not the only
ones that saw this thing
well certainly not
but we dont know what
happens to the information
once we inform the authorities do we
thousands of people
could have reported it
no reason to single us out
except me im the one they want dead
oh josephine
it true doc
were targets doc
what are we going to do
kick some ass
stay here and take notes doc
what are you going to do
show these punks
you dont screw with nerds
that bitch aint goin nowhere

that was easy
just give me a minute to pray
how about a second to die
that all ill need
where the hell is she
wont be needing this anymore asshole
yeah i like it
im not sure about this josephine
people have been doing it
for a hell of a long time doc
just point and shoot
those creeps would have killed you
if they had gotten inside
next time somebody shows up
i may not be here to save your ass
what about the body
there shouldnt be any bodies
remember next time
somebody you dont know
sticks their nose in the door
blow it off
ill be back as soon as i can
ill get you you little runt
if it the last thing i do
jesus his pulse is falling
below 50 temperature dropping
how are you still alive though man
hey ive been lookin for you
boy did you pick the wrong time
no you did jack
here i know you burned the first one
so here a replacement
just dont waste it
how the case coming
i know the who
but i havent figured out the why
every time i start asking questions
trancers pop up and start shootin
i singed five today new kill record
congratulations
but you better break the record
for finding the killer
because youre starting to fade
what the hell are you talking about
in the tcl lab your existence
up the line is ceasing
which means in the very near future
im or my kid gonna die
unless you can stop it fast
i gotta tail these kids
and you gotta get the hell out of here
before you get busted
god i hate trancer hunters
remember me
shouldnt you be dead
or at least in school
move it
hey if you let me go
ill make it worth your while
unless youve got an extra eye in there
im not interested
no really ive got some great
stuff in my car to give ya
you cant give me anything
that compares with what
ill get for catching you
everybody gets a little blue friend
move it
just swallow and enjoy the nice ride
why miss jo good to see you
yeah itll be good to see you
on a slab
you were supposed to kill her
yeah this is even better
you better hope miss shauna thinks so
or shell burn out that other eye
jesus christ
i dont know if he can hear you
you dont think much of
this place either kid
kid
how old are you
older than you think
so whered they pick you up
sleeping in a doorway on
argyle like the rest of us
all these kids runaways
runaways cause mom and dad
tossed our asses out
or dad couldnt keep
his slong away from his daughter
rest of em are just your run
of the mill bums and winos
everybody got a real nice story
what about you
im just a musician
who old lady shot herself
and the cops think i did it
so this place is just fine for me
by the way
everything i just admitted is bullshit
in case anybody asks
fair enough
so how come youre not havin a big time
starin in to space like your friends
i spit my little blue friends out
around here it a good idea
to keep your head on straight
guess it pretty easy
to control a bunch of kids
if theyre zonked out of their minds
you can get some in front of
the transformer without a fight
what the hell a transformer
you havent been indoctrinated yet
oh youre gonna love it
hey
you meet your family leader in two hours
get some rest
itll be a long night
hey it can get pretty
cold in here at night
in case you wanna
share some body warmth
im not into guys
i mean just stick to your guitar
welcome to your new home children
holy shit
miss work out herself
you know miss west
she the reason were all here
i know that you have all had
a hard life on the streets
but the days of living in fear are over
from now on
others will live in fear of you
and your new family
will protect you always
for ive been given a gift from the sky
and i choose to share it with you
when somebody hassles you
dont you wanna fight back
yeah
when youre broke and youre cold
and nobody gives a damn
whether you live or you die
dont you wanna show some strength
yeah
prove to the world that you exist
that you do count
yeah
yeah then come to me
and ill give you all of that and more
come and receive a gift from the stars
done
now
done
feel your strength children
so this is how it all got started again
ill be a son of a bitch
how what got started
trancing
something you dont know about
and dont wanna know about
what
all this bug eyed monster crap
hey three hots and a cot
plus i get to see some wild shit
bring him out
some of you know my history
heroin armed robbery prostitution
a life on the streets at
the hands of men like this
but i found the strength
to break away from that life
and rebuild myself and to help others
i was lost just like you
but i found a source of strength
are you gonna let men like that
throw you away like you are nothing
he thinks that youre garbage
did you know that
garbage
is that what you are
dont be lost anymore
youre part of a family now
yeah
that all for tonight
we have to get these
children back to the city
so they can show their strength and unity
where are they taking them
all over the city
wherever miss shauna thinks
theyll do the most good
good job now eat your fill
hey dont you know too many
of those aint good for you
the police should be discovering
the bodies any time now
they were perfect
the taste of blood worked
them into such a frenzy
all we had to do was turn them loose
and the media should be
crawling all over the crime scene
now the public going
to be shaking in their beds
shocking
imagine a man and woman killed
right in front of their own home
a deputy mayor and his wife
if the rich arent safe in
their gated communities
then who is
no one
now weve aimed high this time
but we have to start
finding replacements
for the city and state
officials weve removed
not some carbon copy
idiots taking their place
but our own people
our own trancers
look i know this is better
than livin on the streets
but you dont wanna be tranced
theyre frying your brains
theyre teaching us
to stand up for ourselves
by killing on command
that the kind of scum bag
who been victimizing us our whole lives
tell me honey
how many of those little blue
devils have you eaten today
oh youre losin em
why not let it go
because i know what kind of
crazy shit this will lead to
what
have you got a crystal ball
yeah ive seen the future
and it sucks unless we do
something about it now
look i know youre all
drugged or hypnotized
that sleazebag with the hot dog cart
probably been feedin you crap
for months to soften you up
sam is our friend
look you gotta get it together
this place is goin up in flames
and i dont wanna see innocent people
buy it for some trancing bitch
now i can help you get
the hell out of here
but you gotta want it
you better give it up
before the guards come round
with the bedtime feeding
where the hell are you goin
men room
hey it me
yeah ive got something to report
yeah in the usual way
you did your job now make your report
the girl was trying to get
the bunk house to escape with her
cause she said the whole place
was going up in flames
now what did she mean by that
i dont know
i dont know miss shauna
i kept her alive trusting you mark
to find out what she knew
so you can turn her
but then ive always had a
little doubt about your worth
maybe i should just treat
you like the other me
and put you in the trancing
beam just to be sure
then we can never be together again
well youre very replaceable
youre lucky that i choose
to tolerate you for now
you see
they dont seem like theyre
having such a bad time
sure theyre all brain dead
it better than the alternative
when you gonna wise up babe
son you really dont know
who youre dealing with
id back off big time if i were you
surprised it took you so long to find it
it was right there in plain sight
sorry to point out your shortcomings
she getting away
hey you looking for this
get your ass out of the car
miss jo what happened to the nice clothes
and the nice attitude
lady i knew would never play with guns
lady you knew is gone asshole
pity i liked her
i dont give a shit about you
josephine
so youve changed your look
it not very sophisticated though
ill take that as a compliment honey
how many of these kids have you killed
we are just helping a lost and
bitter generation find a purpose
that little demonstration of
yours last night was lovely
when do they start eating brains
dont worry youll understand everything
in just a few seconds
you mousy little bitch
i dont know how you got here
but you are leaving on a mission
cause there someone that we need
to help us fight the scum of the world
and youre gonna get him for us
say you understand me
i understand you
i live to do your will
to flourish in your shadow
to grovel at your feet like
the unworthy cur that i am
to wallow in your filth
that enough
no nothing enough
god above all others
master of all masters
get her and two others
ready for transport
what task has the glorious miss shauna
set us to this fine day
we who are so unworthy
we could never hope to
will you shut up with that crap
there the objective right over there
get out
im not afraid to use force
good god josephine
what have they done to you
i have willingly been made a lowly drone
to the splendid miss shauna
man you got her started again
good lord josephine
i thought you were with them
the important thing is they bought it
now we gotta get you the hell out of here
one more step and
ill blow his head off
drop the gun now
come on jack
kill this bastard so i can
bring you back up the line
so how the revolution goin babe
josephine what is all this
why is this happening
cause this bunch of
assholes wants power
they think you can help them get it
theyre wrong
i know
that our ace in the hole
he didnt put up a fight at all
it your ex-employee
who causing all the problems
now she gone to enormous
lengths to protect malvern
you might be able to use that
i know how to handle this
no youll leave a pile of corpses
and we wont be any closer to our goal
if miss forrest and
malvern have a friendship
use it against them
once malvern is compliant
you can gut the girl for all i care
but if you kill her now she of no use
those are my orders shauna
yes sir
good evening doctor
hope this hasnt been too
much of a trial for you
except for the zombies
and the mass murders
it been peachy
youre lucky youre still standing
id show a little bit more
respect if i were you
yeah toots
respect for what
the possibility of new world order
with your help doctor
josephine told me
that the meteor we tracked
come take a look
what it say
less than 20 retins
josephine there practically
no radiation at all
see
no danger of contamination
bullshit
what about the ray that thing gives off
doctor even though it has no radiation
this meteor has special
qualities that we have distilled
an energy force that alters human tissue
particularly those of the brain
what are you talking about
by focusing the energy
using this device
were able to concentrate
the ray on the frontal lobes
using the optical nerve
as a point of entry
good god
what have you done to this child
oh this is just a demonstration
but you see the result
with certain drugs weve been able
to control the behavior of these subjects
evoke certain emotions
and in this case rage
nothing like an army of killers
to make your megalomaniacal day complete
that why youre here
i cant have anything to do with
something so monstrous
these results are not our ultimate aim
this poor child life
was over a long time ago
dont feel sorry for her
god
doctor we dont want
you to be a part of this
we want you to help us modify the beam
so that the results are not that extreme
examine the meteor test its elements
i know that you can find a
key to harness this force
we dont want an army of killers
what do you expect from me
your best efforts
or you friend is dead
doc dont listen to that shit
and dont worry about me
im gonna kill all their trancing asses
she helpless
if you want her to live then get to work
come on i want to show you something
come on
you cant do anything for her now
weve been gathering these meteors
since the first shower
started two years ago
i remember
i tracked it i reported it
only to us doctor
weve intercepted all
your reports since then
they led up to the very
first tiny pieces of energy
scattered around the desert
we saw the potential for something
very important in that rock
and started experiments
the results are in here
weve had other scientists work with us
on perfecting the trancing beam
the results as you can see have been
well unfortunate
so all this human
misery worth it isnt it
dont suddenly grow balls doctor
they dont fit you
just do as your told
and you and the girl can walk out of here
dont try my patience
if you havent noticed i dont have any
jennings if you can hear me
dont worry
my daughter aint dyin
like this and neither am i
you got a problem babe
just talkin to a friend up the line
i was tellin him how sweet
it gonna be to kill you
dont think so babe
see ive looked into my future
and it clear sailing
ive got somebody on the inside
no shit
just dont count on them
to protect you from me
im shakin babe
im the one on the inside
i never seen one do that before doc
you need to try that again
dont worry well get this up
put me down
you know how this works
doctor dont you
complete the circuit
and you get a real nice effect
stop it
are you out of your mind
failure wont be tolerated doctor
i gave you a job to do
and i expect you to do it
one more test that doesnt work
and miss forrest
the name jo deth bitch
deth fine
how appropriate
and it wont be a pretty one either
unless your friend cooperates
i wont let you down
put her in the last cell
enjoy yourself
ive singed trancers that make you guys
look like choir boys
youre nothin
okay
guess were all in the same shape here
it alright im a friend
how do the targets look to you
oh theyre doable provided
we can replace them quickly
with our own people
oh that being taken care of right now
now malvern has given
you nothing but failures
assassins are fine but we need
intelligent subjects we can control
his background makes
him perfect for this
and let just say
i gave him a little incentive
i know we want to put
one of our own in power
as soon as possible
i have the candidate
we dont even have to trance this one
to get him to do what we want
but treatments would modify his behavior
and give us a chance to educate him
i can see him running for office
oh i could see him winning
have your eyes on being the first lady
im not that ambitious sir
ill settle for assisting you
how comforting
josephine can you hear me
yeah
take this
believe it or not i found
a good use for this thing
with the proper filters
it will greatly reduce your healing time
put the salve on your wounds
and dress them with a sterile gauze
thanks doc
for once im gonna rescue you
thanks
i think i found something
to meet your requirements
how so
i broke down the base elements
of the meteor and found substances
that will filter out certain
types of the energy it gives off
the dosage of the ray can be controlled
so you can simply break a man will
or turn him into a raving
animal your choice
since i need to have it
operate at its mildest level
i think josephine would be
a perfect choice dont you
i mean it cant hurt her much
that not the deal we talked about
i dont remember
having that conversation
in fact i dont think
that it ever took place
you know your shit doc
here thisll help
with this gift from the stars
i can give you strength and power
sometimes we need a brute force
to deal with the scum
who control our lives
and other times
we need the power of mind
now we have a choice as to
which direction we will go
in order for our voice
to be heard in this world
and i ask you children
do you want a voice
yes
yes
i ask it again
do you want a voice to
be heard in this world
not the cries of some weak victims
but someone of strength
of body and mind
someone with true power
yes
yes we want it
then you all have your
chance in the transformer
and youll have the honors of being first
doctor malvern you may proceed
you prepare the meteor
ill administer the dosage
and this better work
it should work
now
hey
welcome to your future asshole
you traitor
dont you know
she offering us the world
i wont let you take that away
you whimp ass bitch
you would have been
proud of me josephine
i didnt lose my nerve
i came close
but i singed that whimp ass sam
im always proud of you
and you did a hell of
a lot more than that doc
saved my life
why did you come here
to stop you from killing my daughter
me and thousands just like me
oh gees
take this
use what you need
and turn the rest over
to a research laboratory
it would be nice if they gave me credit
in the scientific journals
dont worry doc
youre gonna do all that yourself
how come when it over
there always one body too many
i didnt think your
kid could handle this
but i was wrong
you make a great team
jack just give me the word
and ill bring you back up the line
did you know that being an asshole
is the leading cause of
death in both men and women
give me my smokes and hit the road
you know
i never thought of you as
anything but a repressed
stuck up bookish little nothing
never underestimate anybody
whose last name is really deth
oh i know that now
your name is very well
known to my associates
the others behind trancing you mean
maybe
there are hundreds of us
and we control thousands
so killing me actually gets you nothing
wrong
it gets my rocks off
goddamn aliens
smell even worse when they die
youve had quite a night
wanna make it complete
and come back up the line
jennings did you know
castle was a stinkin alien
we had no information about him on file
since he was using
the meteor energy though
probably brought it with him
you saved your daughter
that was the mission and you did it
no this mission isnt over
castle said there
hundreds more like him
thousands more trancers
aliens whatever they are
im ready for action
youre goin after all of them
that the job description ace
jack youre a colossal pain in the ass
but youre one hell of a trancer hunter
youll see me back up the line
when
when i know it safe for my daughter
to have her own life back
ive always figured that
the only jobs worth doing
are the ones worth dying for
that not for everybody
especially my kid
scumbags are lookin for her now
so ive gotta stay right here
to strike at them first
my name jack
jo deth
and im a trancer hunter
as i look out on
the sea of faces around me
i wonder how many of
em are regular folks
and how many of em
are ready to trance out
my job is to find out
trancers not really alive
not dead enough
until im through with em

there are all sorts of ways
to hit a cue ball
the thing youre trying to do
is send it
in a particular direction
to hit another ball and drop
that ball into a pocket
but it where you send
the cue ball next
that separates you
from the others
when you first start playing
you think it only
about that one ball
you can put backspins
sidespin or topspin on a ball
or you can make it stop
on a dime bounce off a rail
you can hit a ball soft hard
or just give it a little kiss
you can send a ball
behind another ball
to make it hard for
your opponent to make a shot
once you have the skills
you can do any of these things
some dads take their kids
to church or to the ball game
that what some dads do

he took me to pool halls
and he taught me how to play
a game called 9-ball

it takes foresight

going to tell her
only this time i meant it

shell probably play with me

thank you

i dont know
it stuck again
something about
an administrator
and you havent introduced any new software since i wiped your drive
come on
were gonna be late for gym class
and that would be
a huge tragedy
well it sites my
granddaughter sent me
i know you
warned me about it

she in damascus and she sent pictures
and you know how hard for me
it is to see her
did you get a security alert
no i simply cannot

screw you maltz
why dont you go make out with your cross-eyed girlfriend
penis
newman is this your
first time with figjam
figjam
yeah were in the information acquisition business
well okay
yeah
figjam fuck im good
just ask me
him
this better be good rashe
good morning ken
show me
morbidity rate 986 %
set up the skiff
get me paget from homeland
cavanaugh from cdc
and stradler from
the joint chiefs
again full-screen
yes sir
that my girl
these are terrorists people
eliminated in an automated operation with 986 % efficiency
986 the temperature
of blood
and not a drop of ours spilled
thanks entirely to our girl ripley
ripley detected this particular terrorist cell
through one of
her honeypot sites
attractive high-stakes games hidden
in the darker reaches of the internet
screen
once a player penetrates
level 5
ripley tags him
as a security threat
ripley engaged
skilled gamers
exhibiting familiarity with weapon systems and terror tactics
this particular group managed to pool winnings of just under $3 million
which we paid
wait a minute
you paid
a terrorist group $3 million
that affirmative general
but youll be pleased to know that everyone associated with this group
is either in custody or already enjoying their much-hyped afterlife
ripley walks tall
and carries a very big stick
that why we
applaud everyone here
for endorsing ripley status
of complete autonomy
both foreign and domestic
temporary domestic autonomy
kenneth
let take your girl for a walk before you let her off her leash
there were innocents
at that party
understandably collateral
but what assurances
do we have
ripley wont orchestrate
a similar attack at home
ripley wont be dropping bombs at home
mr paget
and there will
always be innocents
at least ripley hit this target away from population and cameras
and she targeted
their vehicle
which just happened to be loaded with
c-4 and iranian katyusha missiles
the explosion that killed these people was theirs
not ours
thank you for your time
one question
what happens if we miss the connection after weve paid them off
i mean
if these guys are smart enough to beat the game
then they might be smart enough to beat their tail
in which case we wouldnt just be tempting them
wed be financing them
terror is a filthy sewer
filled with hatred and bile
that threatens our shores
if we are to
protect ourselves
we have to be able
to anticipate threats
are we tempting those
who would harm us
damn right if theyre innocent
truth will out
in the meantime ripley
will be online 24/7
looking to
identify our enemies
and the next 6-year-old who is a year away from strapping on a bomb
let focus people
you got 0 minutes to turn in your tests
need answers for 7
5 6 and 20
mr maltz i believe
you dialed the wrong number
damn
all computers are doomed
this machine didnt make
this kind of mistake
this machine was adjusting itself during the game
to the situation
that just arose
now i know
i propose that these
hey you know you promised your mom you wont play wow anymore
i totally agree with that
in fact i swear to you i will never
ever bother you about that again
arent you gonna ask why
why
actually you dont have to because im gonna tell you anyway
i just found this new gaming site
it called ripley
you know like
the matt damon movie
or alien
yeah whatever
anyway
this one has no limit
and i will stake you
with every cent that i have
which is equal to or less than the amount you already owe me
less less actually
so exactly how did mr
kasparov beat big blue
the world smartest
chess computer
he used
an unexpected strategy
he used an
unexpected strategy
a counter-intuitive strategy
something the computer
couldnt anticipate
mr
farmer youve suddenly taken an interest in chess
well actually
i dont play
but i was considering
taking it up
perhaps youd like to join our excursion
to montreal for the internationals
ill think about it
think mr farmer
imagine yourself
making a decision
so youre
interested in chess
about as much as you
oh you mean
because it didnt look like i was paying attention
because you were texting
and doing your nails
i already know
that match by heart
oh you dont believe me
didnt say that
didnt have to
you looked up and to the right
it a clear tell
oh really
what am i telling now
pain
if youre serious
about the trip
it $550
but you might get a discount because of the no-show
you going
what it to you
just curious
you are so full of it
youre an easy read
for a smart kid
maybe you shouldnt take up chess
cause if i faced you over a board
id take you apart
before your first move
bring it on then
no you gotta get yourself together before someone can take you apart
that how it works
* there a little hope
* in little plans
* bells chime out today
* you made your key
quite old to find
* the space you left behind
fills meaning there
* but now just favorite songs
* you know tonight im home
hmm
favorite quote
robert oppenheimer

rebecca
becky
no
i have your id sucker
you try and hack my password again
ill burn you
she put in a mousetrap
that scary
of course if you happen
to be mr will farmer
maybe you should just come to montreal if youre so curious
grab me a beer
so neatness doesnt
really count
not when youre
about to pass out
bless you tough day
lately were putting out more bullshit than air freshener
dont touch
theyre dumping
my odorless bleach idea
but i talked them into letting me keep my beta samples
talked them into
let just say they owed me
it one thing to take my ideas and keep all the profits
but to dump something
because a new vp doesnt want
to be upstaged by a woman
you getting sick
uh-huh
i hope it a cold
the flu is supposed to be
really nasty this year
what would you say if i told you i was thinking of taking up chess
id wanna know
the girl name
and how much
it going to cost
mr massude left you a packet
it over by the door
there a trip to montreal
it $550 but i think
i can get a discount
her name annie
good luck
* everybody wanted to see you
* everybody wanted to steal
okay
* no one else is here
to stop this
* something they
just couldnt steal *
spyware

thousand at a time to avoid detection

we usually wait until after we beat you with a phone book
mr nichols
you know
if you guys want to convince me im not in any trouble
then youll quit
calling me mr nichols
we dont have to convince you
of anything mr nichols
it going to be up
to you to convince us
of what exactly
that im not part of a high-school terrorist chess conspiracy
why did you make me
miss my flight
do you have any idea how much money my father paid for that ticket
tell us about mr farmer
your friend
all right
tell us about the game
if youd like to cooperate
you might save both yourself
and your friend a great deal of trouble
what do you want me to say
there nothing to tell
will is just a smart kid who played some stupid online game
to win some money to go on a trip with a girl
that it okay
end of story
there nothing else
but you know i mean
if you guys wanna add more to that
then feel free to call my father
who happens to be a lawyer
then we can sue you for violation of my civil rights
what girl
oh youve got to be
kidding me
consider this
your smart friend used funds provided by a terrorist cell in syria
and wagered it against
government computers
and displayed insider knowledge of biological and chemical weapons
meanwhile his mother
a bio-engineer at wyren
has been stealing and stockpiling chemical agents
this means that your very smart friend
mr will farmer
is being sought for bioterrorist activities against philadelphia
and is very likely to spend the rest of his life in federal prison
regarding your civil rights
you dont have any
not where terrorist linkage
is highly probable
you happy now dennis
why should i be happy
i just called you dennis
didnt i
command we have visual
on baker zulu niner
well continue observer status till subject lands
copy
it wasnt immigration
wasnt the local law it wasnt fbi
you hacked all those sites
i had to find out
who took him
according to local state and federal databases
that car doesnt exist
so who took him
i dont know
but whoever it was really freaked the shit out of him
because he left me the same amount of cash for fixing his computer
he knew he was gonna
be gone for a while
hello
mom hey
will is that you
of course it me
who else calls you mom
are you in montreal
no were still on the plane
theyre still kind of circling
listen i was just wondering
have you heard anything from dennis
he didnt make the flight
something about a family emergency
no nobody called
i dont think
hey anything else
about mr massude
oh a moving van pulled up
and i think they took
everything out
they cleaned out his house
it just seems kind of sudden
oh just a sec
hey mom

why did she just do that
somebody
im locked out
were back on
analyzing compound
bioterror threat level 2
holy shit
tell me why that happened
what does she know
come on what does she know
she analyzing the chemical compounds
that were seized from the farmer home
if i were a betting man
i would say she found something
perfect
who is it
jesus
i just got off the phone with cdc and homeland
who were giving me
a tag-team ass-chewing
because you put philadelphia
on a stage 2 alert
not us sir ripley
that exactly what we wanted to do
what the hell their problem
well there
a new flu out there
and cavanaugh
people are jumping
meanwhile ripley has labeled
mrs farmer son
as a person of interest
and were tagging him
to see where he leads
how the hunt going
on the syrian front extremely well
solid leads
ive got a budget meeting next week
this could be good
i dont know
much about him
mr baron
annie annie please
it been a very miserable afternoon for all of us
you have my word they will let me know the minute they hear anything
but for now
can we just take a will break and find our bus
sorry im sorry
it my fault
ive been meaning to get
these glasses fixed
but life just keeps getting in the way of my best plans
tell me about it
that great
did anyone see
you leave the group
no you really scared me
are you all right
okay let go okay
video cameras street surveillance
theyre tracking me
who are they
that what we have to find out
wait
listen i promise
i will not get you into trouble
i just want to find out
if my mom is okay
i have a plan
if i could do this alone
i wouldnt ask you
come on
so what now
ive gotta hack ripley
and try to find my mom
youre nuts
do you know that
okay take a look
he standing next to the computer
you see him yeah
no i dont see anything
here tell me what you see
i see a really
really hot guy
that not what i meant
okay mr
slick over there is doing more than just mesmerizing women
with his supreme
manly intelligence
he is hacking into the merchant bank supercomputer behind us
i was in the cafe
the guy pulling heavy side jobs
im talking running credit cards and pocketing the cash
of course
he didnt notice me because im not a chick
and these pringles
this is all part of your plan
yes as a matter of fact yes
were gonna piggy-back on our guy there to get into that system
you dont really
think he hot
okay so that why we have
to borrow his terminal
borrow
and let me guess
you want me to distract him
just for a minute
not a problem
and yes
in a purely put-a-bag-overhis-personality
use-him-as-a-pleasure-machine
kind of way
he passable
so you want to use
a computer
you look really smart
thanks
it hot
you know computer
is that a camera
yeah
so technological
see
just go there
you wanna use it
there are so many letters
pleasure machine
i dont know what to pick
just pick one
um that one
oh im sorry
sorry sorry
that all right
the internet isnt
waterproof right
i just wish
it all right
so mademoiselle um
let me show you
the computer over there
okay mademoiselle
you have a really nice accent
i like that
you like that all right
ill just show you how this works
yeah
oh wow
there numbers on the top and under
easy isnt it
you can actually give me
your e-mail address
really
do you have one
i dont know what that is
oh okay yeah
that was impressively scary
i almost felt sorry for the guy
thank you
almost
is your cell phone working
dont worry ill bump through some hacked accounts
so they cant trace us
fine
okay we should be
peer-to-peer
and ready to look
right down ripley throat
okay so like
when other kids were out playing baseball
you were in a dark room
playing with computers
i played baseball
third base all-stars
and i didnt play
with computers
i built them
okay can you
spell over-achiever
hey my dad taught me about computers
and he was my third-base coach
blame him
attention intrusion
sorry talk to me
we got somebody in our database with a knife and fork
no make that a shovel
theyre backdoor
through a hacked account
someone knows
what theyre doing
any idea
ripley tracing it
oh christ get that
image off the screen
at least we know
who watching
but he didnt need
to see her like that
tracing file access
inserting mobile
tracking software
what ripley gonna do
in all likelihood she already done it
this is carter
who have we got up at montreal
do you think that was her
i couldnt really tell
she got bad sinuses from working around chemicals all these years
when she gets a cold
if she not careful it turns to pneumonia
will will
we cant stay here why
because there is someone watching us
in the doorway across from the cafe
this guy
i ran into him before at the airport
a guy what guy
what did you say i nothing
he seemed innocent
i just ran into him
oh jeez annie go
over here this way
i think we lost them
go go go go
down here
okay did we lose them
yeah i think so
it crazy
oh jesus come on run
where are we going
the subway just trust me
this way
cut them off
are they following us
i dont know
are you okay
tracing mobile transponder
we gotta be bugged
did they give you anything at orientation
i didnt get that far
remember
wait wait
your cell phone
stupid
will will
connection lost
connection lost
will
it okay
it all right
were gonna stay
here till after dark
no no theyre gonna
come after us
they wont
im sorry im so sorry
i just wanna go home
the girl cell phone
found it 2 miles down the track
theyre still searching
they havent found the kids you know
you want some fries
yes thank you
ripley have any guesses
where theyre going
i dont think ripley guesses
about anything
i think ripley relies on her amazing feminine intuition
sorry rip didnt mean
to make that sound offensive
and the mother
she still in icu
theyre doing tests on her
nobody sure exactly what she got
does hassert
know any of this
you didnt speak to him
you know i spoke
with him earlier
he confident that ripley following protocols
and that we should
do the same thing
ripley premature
in any of this
who knows
that profile certainly fits
kid and his mother both disenfranchised
after what happened to the father
the kid with outstanding computer and chem weapon knowledge
and the stuff that
we found in that kitchen
there stuff there that could be used to make a bio-weapon
which could trigger
the decon system
or it could be used to make
anti-bacterial mouthwash
and where are the samples
that the thing
she wont tell us
what
yeah
hassert gave ripley priority to classify on her own discretion
even from us
yeah
what do you think
thinking is
bioterror threat
level 3
decontamination
system on standby
back at the cafe
when my e-date was wowing me
with his mastery
of the internet
i asked him if he ever
heard about ripley
let me guess he claimed
he owned the concept
not exactly
but he did help me
do a google search
which yes i could have done myself
but you said to distract him
did you ever hear about
a guy named stephen falken
he designed the old system
the one that they replaced with ripley
the joshua project
i know what
the joshua project was
i just had no idea
it was replaced by ripley
no not just that
when ripley took over
falken went crazy
he threatened to kill himself to stop them
and then they ignored him
and one day he just rode his truck off a bridge
he killed himself
just an urban legend
and he had remarried
he had a wife and two kids
a hell of a protest
i think i just
found a way out
uh im just gonna stay here
upgrading search
for suspects to local police
i hope this is
important people
the fat lady was just about to die of consumption
ill assume
were all up to speed
with the samples confiscated
from the farmer residence
i believe it clear that these alone
constitute just cause for a level 3 alert
the complete list contains
at least 5 agents
which in a series of combinations
could be used as a bio-weapon
by who
that our call
we also have confirmation
from your chemical and bio-sensors in the greater philadelphia area
that they are showing the presence of some of these compounds
well were talking about a major chemical manufacturing corridor here
hell weve got wyren dow
corning and four or five others
less than 0 miles
from downtown philly
all the more
reason for caution
you cant honestly believe this kid mother is involved
worst thing anyone
ever said about her
is that she over-qualified
for her pay scale
youre forgetting the father
ancient history
the woman works with household and personal antiseptics
were talking about mouthwash
for christ sakes
they test
the stuff on bacteria
which makes it perfectly reasonable to expect traces at home
i doubt the woman could threaten our democracy with gingivitis
there were more than traces
we are talking about the quarantine of millions of people
billions in expense
not to mention the potential for riot and panic
and how in hell did you gain access to our sensory data
without our knowledge
it as much
our turf as yours
our turf our call
are these your
staff decisions
or is this incredible load
of horse shit
being handed out by
that computer vixen of yours
computer vixen i see
id like to underscore the importance of our mutual cooperation
and unless
i hear otherwise
im going to assume
we have your support
unless anyone has anything to add
im going to try and catch the fourth act
ah
i gotta get some real food
i wish id taken french
i did
im trying to remember
the french word for hotdog
uh
try bread what that
you want two rabbits
nice work
um two of those
oh hotdogs
yes hotdogs
hey were gonna
get through this
are you sure
i havent been
sure of anything
since that glass half full question in seventh grade
really so what is it
half full or half empty
you first
never thought it mattered unless you happen to be dying of thirst
oh my god
what
it us were on tv
were like this bio-chem version of bonnie and clyde
will there a cop
still there
i think we should split up
okay
im gonna go first
all right
okay
you should stay together
i have a truck in
the lot down by the pier
meet me there
who are you
im the gentleman who nearly
started world war iii
move move
we havent much time
on the driver seat there a laptop
if you wouldnt mind
okay
youre stephen falken
mr slick showed me
his picture on the internet
you know what
youre supposed to be dead
i am technically
after i trashed my reputation and everything else i valued in life
trying to put
a stop to ripley
suicide seemed like
a believable way out
this way i can keep tabs
on what theyre up to
without giving them
a reason to kill me
how did you find us
ive been following ripley
ripley been following you
and my little
friend here helped
damn were out of range
may i
theyre biting
they assume
youve already escaped
and theyre abandoning
their perimeter
very clever
all i need is
a clear line of sight
i can hack into their cells
reroute all their calls through me
too risky
with ripley watching
any signature
and shell be on us
what do they want
ripley is hunting you will
and everyone on her matrix
let go please
wait before we go
you mind telling us where were going
to find someone to
help us stop ripley
jesus bill
what the hell is that
please tell me this isnt
another ripley issue
not exactly
look i understand what ripley doing
it just
it why you know
come on bill
maybe she is being excessive on the kid and the mother side
but how can you
discount that
what you mean that stuff
from massude brother
is that what
youre talking about
were into dozens
of randomly associated cells
massude a gold mine
i spoke to massude brother
i talked to the guy and with our interrogators over there
he a petty thief
he sells fake cartier watches
out of the souks in damascus
and by now he probably coughed up the names of every person
that he ever known
since he was six years old
which think about this
explains why we have no linkage
between the terrorist side
and the farmer family
no i disagree
six degrees
of separation tina
think about it
given enough time
ripley is gonna tie
half the goddamn civilized world to this thing
what are you saying bill
what do you want us to do
you want us to stop
that probably a treasonable offense
let we could send her
on a wild goose chase
a smoke screen
something to slow her down
i can hear what
youre saying bill
but you dont
mess with ripley
she messes with you
yeah
moving satellite
search to sector alpha 43
satellites heat signatures
does it work
they havent nabbed me yet
my youngest child
joshua loved bears
his favorite
called him max
you mind if i
ask you something
shoot
does your wife
know youre alive
or does she really think
you killed yourself
she knew i was sick
so probably made some sense
me not wanting
to drag them through it
youre sick
pancreatic cancer
it nasty
at least it quick
i was part of
ripley design team
that makes me a threat
my family safety
i couldnt let them threaten that
it probably
better this way
i lost my dad
when i was seven
but i still think
about him all the time
i know your kids are
probably grown up by now
but it seems a shame to deprive them of even a little more time
i thought you said
they wouldnt be looking for us
glove compartment two passports
one for you one for annie
i photoshopped in your ids
do either of you speak french
i do
a little
pretend to be asleep
if they try to search the vehicle
wake up and mumble something about having to go to the bathroom
you just play dead
what if it doesnt work
then theyll save you the trouble of having to pretend
enlarging massude/farmer matrix
hey why are you here
im not
okay
uh
are we where
were supposed to be
it a funnel
rarely used as a murder weapon
there a thermos
and sandwiches in the cab
good vermont cheddar
once we fill up
we wont be stopping again
too dangerous
what happened to your dad
he was a computer guy
worked for mci
and lived in virginia
y2k rapid deployment
he used to have all
kinds of cool gear
he used to let
me play with it
anyway he was off
on a big job in europe
picked up some weird bug
the infection went
straight to his heart
one day we were laughing about how
much snot he could blow out his nose
then he wasnt there anymore
funny thing
mom was always the one that had problems with infections
he was afraid shed pick up
something at work
that what they told you
your dad worked at mci
technically that true
but it wasnt y2k
the travel was in bosnia
for the government
i knew about your dad
when i was teaching at mit
he was a student there
later he became a communications liaison for the military
he believed it was an important humanitarian mission
and he wanted to help
because of his specialized knowledge of early gsm networks
he was sent to
track down f-6 pilots
there were
unspeakable atrocities
rumors of biological weapons
your dad may
have been a victim
shouldnt they
have warned him
or at least tried to help
exactly the sentiments
your mother expressed
which made her very unpopular with certain government agencies
i think you begin to see why ripley is so interested in you both
it not right
it no matter
your dad was a hero will
you must never forget that
was the decon system alerted
what i dont get is why ripley wont share information with us
she a computer
her primary job is to identify and kill terrorists
anyone who compromises
that objective is expendable
and loser buys breakfast
i think i got you
hey
it goes to show you
beauty before age
newman
no
no network
does he know youre coming
who
the guy who gonna
help us beat ripley
oh god dr falken falken
two
okay
right here
two
okay here you go
all right
two all right
all right
okay
all right
all right
are you gonna be
okay dr falken
stephen please
you two are now
all the family i have
hey hey in there
hey
dont bother with that
there nothing to sight on
you dont like to knock
i sent you several text messages
didnt you get that
it broken you fix
that who gonna
help us defeat ripley
oh dear god no not him
him
that joshua
wow it old
in his day
he was miles ahead of the curve
they sent us both out to pasture at the same time
i had him quietly shipped
out of state
and then here
to run a power grid
amazingly no one cared
that piece of shit
can do nothing right
he slow
i can beat it at chess
are you russian
i used to be in
soviet space program
but soviet space program
not what it used to be
you like vodka
youve been doing a lot more than just
playing chess and running the grid
i do a little
phishing after hours
that piece of shit can barely manage simple job like credit card fraud
maybe you dont know how to handle a sensitive one like this
i treat it too good
wow
atta boy joshua
time to wake up
greetings
professor falken
shall we play a game
yes joshua
many many games
bioterror threat level
are you really suggesting ripley tried to kill you
that absurd
no no ill tell you
what absurd
that a kid is fighting for his life in hospital right now
because of your
goddamn arrogance
that what absurd
excuse me sir
i just spoke with the surgical team
and
newman vitals are stable
but he hasnt regained consciousness
that cavanaugh
he on me
wanting to know why we still havent released the farmer woman
now that her condition
been downgraded
how could he know that
someone hacked into the system and circulated her file
someone
no prizes for guessing who
will somebody please explain to me how
with a $300 million budget
we cant manage to find one high school kid and his girlfriend
and that would be the cdc
cdc fbi dhs cia
ive got the whole damn
alphabet on my ass
demanding that we shut
this operation down
is that something
youre considering
i cant
another tip from massude brother
our afghan special-ops team
found a bio-weapon prototype
three of the compounds in common with the farmer samples
evidence points to
a sleeper cell in philly
bioterror threat level 4
commencing pre-decontamination procedure
initiating
decontamination countdown
im sorry mr hassert
ive got the cdc homeland
and the joint chiefs
for you on speaker 0
decontamination countdown
beginning now
never seen that
countdown before
what happens at zero
you dont wanna know
turn the bitch off
we cant what do you mean
you cant
ripley has control
the system impervious to human interference
that was the point
edwards air force base
just came online
ripley taken control
of one of their predators
it was stationed over afghanistan
fully armed and fuelled
nukes
smart bomb with multiple
low-yield warheads
well say halleluiah hassert
if that baby hits
us airspace
it gonna be
a white damn christmas
how long is it gonna
okay joshua have fun
beginning power
reroute now
can joshua defeat ripley protocol in philadelphia

are you referring to
the current operation
seeking to apprehend
you and your friends
wait ripley knows
were here
yes that is why she requests
that i deliver a message

i have a buyer
we could make
wonderful business
and i could
have you arrested
i am arrested
so you are
get him out of here
decontamination
in 48 minutes
how this gonna work
when you log on to ripley
she puts a bug in your system
if everyone can log

if we can raise her temperature
we might force a prompt
try
morbidity rate
recalculated to 58 %
collateral damage acceptable
if you fire into
that mainframe
ripley will think she being attacked
and start launching missiles
not if i just break the glass
im not gonna risk

professor falken
we hear you joshua
what happening
what ripley doing
partitioning
shutting down
shutting down that good
that what we want isnt it
she not just
admitting defeat
ripley self-destructing
she ran a self-check
discovered joshua
she treating him
like a virus
now as he tries to migrate through her system to survive
she has to cannibalize
herself to get to him
ripley cant self-destruct
that a direct violation of her program
technically yes
so what the problem
mission redirected
destination washington dc
target eta 7 minutes
morbidity rate 00 %
you realize that if ripley destroyed
it automatically triggers a response
nuclear
depending on
the incoming vector
radarll trace that baby
right back to afghanistan
there is a genius subculture of chess fanatics who play to lose
they call it suicide chess
you force your opponent
to take your pieces
before he can do
the same to you
so whoever loses wins
if we can teach
ripley that
yes
joshua im going to teach you to play a new game
what are you doing
teaching joshua to
play russian roulette
are you serious
if joshua plays
with live missiles
ripley will have to play out
the wargame scenario
each event will end
in total annihilation
which is a direct contradiction to her programing
and what then
itll force her hand
she either backs off
or starts world war iii
hopefully shell see that
by playing to win she loses
fifteen minutes before
the predator hits dc
for this to be a real threat
i cant tell joshua not to lie
confirm codes
do it
codes accepted
there 36000
nuclear missiles out there
6000 of which are
armed and ready to fire
that a -in-6 chance of having a freaking nuclear warhead

big mike mccain has

what about mullet beach
ill tell eastman to turn up the heat

richard i think this
calls for a celebration

you know ive got this feeling
this is gonna be a
highly productive merger
oh richard richard
laughing
so that about the size of it
our founder and managing director is
sadly unable to function
competently in his position
crying
therefore with the blessing of
mr mccain wife
and power of attorney
it is my melancholy duty
to assume control of mccain world resorts
now mrs mccain and i
feel it would be the best
thing the only thing
to carry out big mike plans as if he
were still here with us
chatting in agreement
now youve all seen the
computer projection
oh that coastline is
some of the prettiest
on earth and the easiest to develop
flat land not much forestation
and it a steal as long as
we make the decision today
those hillbilly aussies wont know it
until it too late
carried unanimously good
big mike would be proud of you
bob one thing worries me
richard and what that bob
our people in australia that soft cock
eastman and his son can they handle this
probably not but
dont you worry about it
we have somebody down there as well

go into partnership
with mccain
youre kidding
he wants to build some

nephew clint eastwood

of my visit
i want the deeds to all
the mullet beach properties

no can do
what the problem theyre in the bank

but my boss told me to leave them

our important cities
raw had captured their chief

serious the situation is
the public has lost it patience
we had informed you

an information from secret source
and had surrounded yakub habibi
the leader of hizbul al-qaida
and other terrorists
in a house adjacent to the airport
they managed to escape from there
andentered a famous school
in kolkata
though most of the students
have been evacuated from there
but as per the information that
we got from a reliable source
a rehearsal of a skit was going
on in the school auditorium
the terrorist have
captivated the students
along with their
teachers over there
keeping in mind
the safety of the students
the police are not being able
to risk going closer to the school
the terrorist group hizbul al-qaida
please please
has taken the responsibility of the
entire incidence and has said that
if arrangements are not
made for them to leave
this country without any harm
by 5 in the evening
then therell be a risk to the lives
of all those who are trapped inside
the only question is what
will the government do
will they consider
the safety of the children
and accept the demands
of the terrorists
or will they risk the lives
of the innocent children
and continue to fight
against the terrorists

hizbul al-qaida
has planned all these
attacks so that yakub is released
the deputy chief of hizbul
al-qaida afzal faridi

mr namdev do you know that we
all are a part of the defense force
and it our duty
to protect this country
it people and its property
but sir if the blast
there will be no blast today
today there wont be any blasts
today will be the day to diffuse
not just bombs
but the confidence of the terrorist
will be diffused too
right
yes sir
indistinct voice
i hizbul al-qaida acting
commander afzal faridi
take complete responsibility
of all the blasts
that took place
through out mumbai
and this is just the beginning
we want to tell
the indian government
that if they do not release
our capable jihadi yakub habibi
within the next 72 hours
with all due respect
then mark my words well shake up
the foundation of india
we will cross
all the limits of terrorism
we will destroy each
and every city of india
we dont fear death
just remember
within the next 72 hours
as per the official data
till now we have
received the confirmation
that 70 people are dead
i wonder what will the final tally be
we couldnt understand
that they have planned this kind
of serial blasts maam
i am very sorry
you can sit before me and say
that you are sorry francis
i wont be able to say sorry
to the people of our country
who have lost their near
and dear ones
even if you are unable
to feel their pain i can feel it
i understand their pain maam
i know it as i too have lost
everything just like them
everything
no i cannot take any more risk
yes maam
rajiv connect me
to the prime ministers office
maam i hope you are not
considering the release of yakub
we have no other choice
maam please try to understand
if yakub is released
do you understand how many more
terrorist attacks will take place
and if yakub is not released
then do you have any idea how many
more people will loose their lives
no no not possible
i cant take this risk
we are not prepared
for any more attacks
maam no more attacks will happen
i promise
our best undercover agent
panther is leading this mission
but francis
panther is a common mortal
just a mere human being
he is not a super hero
panther is not a super hero
he is just a mere human being
but he is not less than a super hero
the word failure is not
in his dictionary maam
and the most important thing
he got a vital lead
about a man named salim
maulana salim mirza
apparently he owns
an antique shop at chor bazaar
in 2002
he went to al dehra for business
and gets in touch
with hizbul al-qaida
then in 2003
he again goes to al dehra
with middle east visa
for five months
most probably for training purpose
he started taking terrorism
class over here since 2005
he didnt take much time
to brain wash the underage
and innocent youngsters
by giving them money
he has created a robin hood image
for himself in chor bazaar
that means we will have to face
mass resistance if we try
to arrest him from chor bazaar
arresting salim reza
in front of public at chor bazaar
is next to impossible
charlie
sir
seeing our way of work it might seem
that we work
while being emotionless
but it emotion
that we have to work with
right
sir
thinking about the dead
and their families do you think
anything is next to impossible
sorry sir
if our heart beats then
jai hind
if we breathe then
jai hind
if we bleed then

believe me sir
i know that im a muslim and that
why i am being tortured like this
this country can never
accept the muslims
everyone has equal
rights in this country
be it hindu muslim sikh
christian or any other religion
no we muslims know
it well that this
country never treats
us as it own
shut up you scoundrel or
else ill tear your tongue out
by calling yourself a
muslim dont
degrade the entire
muslim community
you are a terrorist and a
terrorist has no religion
calling himself a muslim
i am not aware of my religion
but i know this much
that for a true indian
whenever and wherever
there is a decline in
religious practice
o descendant of bharata
and a predominant rise of irreligion
at that time i descend myself
for the protection of the good
the destruction of the wicked
and the establishment
of righteousness
i am born in every age
is as important as
allah is the greatest allah is the
greatest there is no god but allah
and allah is the greatest
allah is the greatest and
to allah belongs all praise
sir i dont know anything
salim
i am asking you for the last time
tell me the truth
who had given the
orders for the serial blasts
or else i will leave you in
such a state that you wont be
able to say anything
through out your life
no
no sir
i will tell you everything
i will tell you everything
sir as per salim confession
aman hassan and samir hassan
had ordered for these attacks
sir if we dont catch
them we wont be able to
get to know about their plans
regarding the next attacks
and as per information
aman hassan and samir hassan
have already left for
al-dera with their family
maam in al-dera indian
embassy do we have any
reliable source who can
be contacted immediately
it will be too late sir
i am going to al-dera i have
already booked my tickets
but panther without government
one day has already past
after the mumbai blast
there will be another
serial blast after two days
are you saying that we will wait
for permission even after this
sir
sir you had taught us that nothing
is greater than our country
and this mission
is for our country
so it good if our
country gives us the
permission for this
mission and if it doesnt
then it even better sir
are you sure panther
yes
the mission approval is
not solely in my hand
and i hope you are aware
of the repercussions of
initiating a mission without
government approval
i know maam the government
will not take responsibility
of even a small mistake made by me
and as im on this mission without
the approval of indian government
i assume al-dera government also
wont support me and that fine
actually maam terrorism is the
cancer of modern world politics
and ill do everything
that needs to
be done in order to
treat the cancer
ray chemotherapy operation
whatever is needed
i will destroy the
cancer affected cell
and will save the
non affected cells
maam i promise i will uproot
terrorism completely
i like your attitude
all the best to you
thank you maam
panther
sir
a special friend of mine jahangir
will receive you at al-dera
you can depend on him
right sir
i want india safe
india will always be safe sir
jai hind
jai hind sir
have you ever been to the
maze at lucknow pardon
actually it an imambara but
people know it as a maze
have you been there
no why
if you ever visit then
you will see that there
are walking paths in
between the walls
but if you enter those paths then
you wont be able to come out ever
but as of now i want to
get out of this airport
i am coming to that
the formula to get out of the
maze is always turn left
did you get it
are you jahangir
yes
but neither my dad was akbar
nor is my son shah jahan
come to the parking area
we will meet there
are you always invisible like
this or do you actually appear
good question
there was a time when i desperately
wanted to become mr india
but that didnt happen
so i try to live like mr india
as much as i can
clear hi i am jahangir
hi you must be knowing that we
are here on a serious mission
what was the need of
this unnecessary build-up
young man
the build-up was much needed
recently
i was diagnosed with diabetes
and my daughter is arriving
today from india for her holidays
so i was finishing off the
coffee with sugar for the last time
as i wont be able to have this
coffee till the time she is around
my black fortuner is in
the parking lot 35308
you go ahead
ill come with my daughter
you
you
what are you doing here
just a second
i was asked to sit in this car
listen i have had enough
wherever i go you follow me
and try to put me in trouble
i didnt put you in trouble
i saved you from trouble
i am trying to
understand that you
you have understood a lot
you dont have to try so hard
to understand me
please just go from here
go otherwise
if not then i will inform
the police right away
i am here
here you are she
she is my daughter zia
professional dancer
dad
yes
dad please ask this
man to go from here
why being with this man
is like inviting trouble
this was the man in the school too
you dont know how
dangerous this man is
it natural to be dangerous
because he is panther
the best undercover agent of raw
come get inside the car
come along
sir
yes get in the car
sir
zia stop the car
what happened
i will explain everything
mr jahangir
i dont have any time at all
now i too dont have the time
zia move
what does that mean
where are we going
it not in our hand now
what do you mean by
it not in our hand
now we have to follow
the car ahead of us
who car is it
that car belongs to the embassy
of our neighbouring country
so
shafiq reza is sitting in it
he is the embassy head
hassan brothers are
the most important
issue to our
neighboring country now
and if my guess is not
wrong then shafiq
is going to the new location
of the hassan brothers now
shafiq is an expert in this kind
of unethical notorious tasks
zia stop
we have come to the right place
it seems hassan family
is kept in this house
to be sure we have to get inside
this house somehow
you may go if you want to
but please do not involve us
in your stupidity
zia calm down
panther this is al dera
the police here do not torture
in a decent way
jahangir you might not be aware of
the first policy
of our raw founder
that to keep the words fear pain
and failure out of our dictionary
but you wont understand all this
let me go
zia move
stop the car stop the car please
what is this jahangir
jahangir turn
greetings aman
greetings shafiq
is everything well yes brother
hope you are not uncomfortable here
not at all brother
brother b-b

shafiq he is shafiq
greetings
greetings young man
hope you all are not
uncomfortable here
no shafiq not at all
you are an amazing host
young man
tell me if you have any problem
it my responsibility to
take care of all your issues
no i mean my wife tabassum
yes
we need to take her to a
doctor urgently i see
i mean there still time
for her delivery
just a minute
delivery that means
your wife is pregnant
are those medical documents yes
what did you just do
it had all the records
of my wife treatment
our government
is extremely serious about
your safety and security
until yesterday you all
were indian citizen
but from today you all are neither
samir nor aman nor tabassum
you and your family
never lived in india
if you have anymore
documents with old identity
then destroy them all
yes panther
sir i dont need this
man named jahangir
but panther
sir please allow me to speak
this man has no idea
about our organisation
i wonder what he thinks of himself
he behaves as if he is not a
raw agent but the chief of raw
calm down panther calm down
the person about whom you
were talking all this while
do you know his real name
yes it jahangir
wrong it a code name
his real name is feroze khan
i hope you have heard of him
feroze khan
feroze khan
you mean the founder of our
organisation feroze khan
our organisation still works
as per the policies made by him
the training procedure
that we maintain till today
is made by him
excuse me
if you are done
complaining about my dad
then i need to talk to you
regarding an important matter
sir i will talk to you later
tell me
listen whatever you want to do with
your life is
completely your decision
but please dont involve
my dad in your mess
throughout my life i have
seen my mom live in fear
which lead to heart
ailment and after that
everything was finished
i dont want to live in
fear like my mom did
zia whatever sir has been doing all
these years is all for our country
our country is
proud of such a man zia
i know i know that the country
should come first
i know this too that i
am alive because of you
but seeing you at the
airport i understood
that my dad is not safe anymore
and i also know this
that your association
will increase the risk to my
dad life and i wont allow it
you may call me anti-national
you may call me selfish
you may say whatever you want to
i really dont care
i have lost my mom
and now if my dad is
harmed because of you
then i will not spare you
listen it no use
telling anything to dad
but i need to tell you
i have no one else
other than my dad
and i dont want to be alone
good afternoon
are we going to any desert
why
because no one
other than a business man
dealing in the desserts
uses this compass
francis was right
you are the best
i dont understand what is
best sir
i always aspire to
be better in life
please come brother
thank you shafiq

doctor was very important
i had already told you
that i am here to resolve
all your problems

be right to delay any more

aman will stay in al dera for few
more days he has some work here

brother
what happened tabassum
sir apart from the
embassy guards
i can see just three members
from the hassan family
please drive faster
it moving
where are they being taken
any idea
not very far as per my intuition
their people are somewhere close
they will take the hassan
family to some other place
aman dont be upset
small benefits always had to be
sacrificed for big benefits
this is the rule of the war
i know shafiq sir
the biggest benefit
in the world is money
i can sacrifice
everything for money
everything
come on

entering a risky zone
it time for action sir

great a student becomes
the teacher is always a teacher
let move
sir
reports have been pouring
in about a massive blast
from an abandoned
army base in al dera
reports have been poring
in about a massive
blast from an abandoned
army base in al dera
no one knows the
motive behind it
al dera government has
rejected all demands
just wait
spider
sir do you have any
information about panther
sir do you need any
information about the
president of america or
north korean president
i am asking for the
information about panther
he is not a person who will
be out of track for so long
what a joke sir
but my track history says
that in last 5 years
we spent most of our time
in order to track panther
he is the most irresponsible
cadre i have ever seen
i agree with you
then
i am not disagreeing with you
how will you do it
but
no ifs and buts
till date
each and every agent of raw
is scared of going ahead
without the tracking
device of spider
but your panther
till date he didnt
use any of my tracking devices
for any mission
he has such a huge ego
im sorry to say our organisation
stands on a discipline
and panther is the most
indiscipline person
you dont need to worry
about panther discipline
okay
just track him
okay
right now
any news about jahangir
no sir
but we are trying our best
find him
as early as possible
right sir
i had warned you
i had told you
not to involve my dad in your mess
but you did exactly that
you made me lonely
zia
please
you dont have to say anything
nothing at all
two of you went on
the same mission
you returned
but my dad died
zia i have returned
just because of your dad
yes zia
and jahangir sir is not dead
he died as a martyr
for our country
sir sir
panther

proud of jahangir sir

international criminals
spider before you start

of working with panther
last time i was saved

i have promised my wife that
we will go for an
europe tour next year
then if i

calm down
i think you should calm down
i can calm down sir but
working with panther is
are you sure
sir there no confusion in this
okay then let me inform panther
as he had made the request
panther had requested
i mean for me
because he thinks you are the
best technical guy we have
you mean
panther told this himself
even he is the best
undercover agent we have
no doubt about it
even i feel so
well
and the combination
of two best person
was much needed for this mission
but when you dont want
to work with panther
no no sir
when panther has himself agreed
that i am the best technical guy
then i can
think of going
for this one mission
with him sir
but sir
since i am going with panther
if anything happens to me
please arrange for the
europe tour for my wife
okay
but who will go along with her
i wont be there so
she will go alone
i knew it
hell bring me here and then play
hide and seek disgusting man
he might have switched
off all the trackers too
i dont know with
whom am i stuck with
my name is spider my network is
spread are all around the world
how many networks will he destroy
and how many times will he fool me
some day i will definitely
hello
panther
panther
you have the tracker to track me
but i have the tracker
to track your device
i agree you had gifted
me this watch in berlin
but that doesnt means that you
will insert a chip in it
that is my work
you must be aware of my work too
no no i know i did a
big mistake coming here
but that doesnt mean
you will bully me
get inside
samir hassan and his family
they were involved
in the mumbai blast
but they have no more information
about the upcoming blasts
impossible
i dont believe that they
dont have any information
spider
yes
i have done all kind of
investigation from my end
they really dont have
any more information
panther no one gives
information just like that
you need to
acquire information
go try out
yes
thank you
hello
hello
you have no information right
i mean they killed so many
people without any information
i am telling the truth sir
i dont know anything
i mean we just used to
follow my brother orders
i am telling the truth sir
i just did whatever my
elder brother asked me to do
today onwards you will do whatever
this brother tells you to do
spectacles it a gift
this is a watch
do you remember
no right
panther what is happening
sir sir
relax
kill us sir
kill us all sir
sir if the brother for whom
i did so much wants to kill us
then we have no right to live sir
i just have one request
request okay
what request
sir take us to our
country and kill us
in this country
sir i want to die
in my own mother land
before committing
the crime he wasnt
even aware that
india is his country
sir i will die in my country
i just want to say this much
no these people
have no information
thank you spider
for giving us this news
it okay i think we should send
them back to india immediately
but it will not be easy to
send them back to india now
shafiq reza and his men are
looking for them like crazy
it extremely risky to
get them out from here
hearing the word risk
something happens in my stomach
anyway all this is not my job
instead i will go
spider over here there is
nothing like your or mine
whatever we are doing we
are doing it for our country
we no no what do you mean
we what do you mean to say
do you want me to take them
with me to india
no you will make
arrangements so that
they are able to get
out of this country
i mean you will prepare their fake
documents like visa passport etc
i knew it you will put me
in mess when i come here
all these illegal job
in a foreign nation
i cant do it
spider please
if you dont help this
mission will not be successful
why are you requesting like this
if you request like this
i will help right away
i mean actually i plan to go
for an europe tour
with my wife next year
but by getting involved
in all this if i
ask him to stop laughing
panther
good luck brother
what happened all well
samir and his family need
to be taken to india
and if their tickets
are not done secretly
if jahangir sir would have
been there then today
i dont know what to do
dont worry i have a friend
here at al dera named shahida
she works at the airport
i am sure she will definitely
book the tickets for india
wait
thanks shahida
once their fake
passports are ready
we have to send their
passport their details to shahida
thanks zia
panther
thank you
till today i had expressed
my demands only to my dad
today i demanded something from
someone else for the first time
thank you for
fulfilling my demands
for not letting me be
lonely and for everything else
thanks
how far has the work progressed
unlike you
i dont work with bullets
but with my brain
itll take time
spider we are short of time
then do one thing let me go
bring someone else
anyway
i wont be able to return to my
country after doing
all this illegal work
spider there is no use returning to
our country if we dont accomplish this
what do you want to say
if we cant take them
back to our country
then we wont be able
to stop the blasts
and if we cannot stop the blasts
we wont be able to face anyone
after returning to our country
sir
yes panther
we are sending samir hassan and
his family to delhi today itself
fantastic
but sir
we couldnt trace aman hassan yet
panther
sir
as per video threat theyll
do a blast at kolkata tomorrow
and ministry has decided to release
yakub in order to stop that
dont worry sir
panther is on duty
i know
thanks
sir why are there so
many people from embassy
they have information
that few passengers
are trying to go to
india on fake passport
okay on which flight
yes shahida
okay thanks for the
information shahida
all okay zia
shafiq reza and the embassy guards
have reached the airport before us
we cant move samir and his
family from al dera airport
i knew
being with him will create a
you cant work with
your limbs always
at times
you should also use your brain
they do a government
job they are not
shut up spider
look at him
zia
is there any flight for
delhi from bidrid airport
yes there is one in
a couple of hours
that means we still have time
call up shahida and ask her to book
their tickets from that airport
also inform her that their names
shouldnt reflect on the system
ensure that just the pnr
is reflected on the system
okay
and yes
she shouldnt cancel the
tickets from al dera to delhi
alright
just speak to her
they are embassy guards
that means since they didnt
find samir and his family at
al dera airport they are looking
for them at all the check posts
zia is there any other
way to reach bidrid
airport avoiding all
these check posts
no there no other way panther
there no other way
but there an idea
let me try zia
i have a europe tour ahead
spider are you okay
water
yes
congratulations spider
finally
you are returning to your country
at least now i deserve a thanks
no first let me safely reach
delhi then i will say thanks
you wont get me immediately
once you reach delhi
it your responsibility to ensure that
samir and his family reach delhi safely
what the
no no i am not crazy like you
no in the middle of the
road if i am then my heart
not the middle of the road
spider middle of the sky
and many things can happen
in the middle of the sky
flight can crash in the middle
of the sky you may die
no no i dont like the
reference of death
besides i have to take my
wife for a europe tour
if i knew that you will leave
me at middle of the road
like this then i would
not have helped
i mean i wouldnt
have helped you at all
okay where are you going
tadzhikistan
tad
yes
spider your tracking
system has failed this time
as per shahida information aman
might have gone to tadzhikistan
so i have to go to tadzhikistan
as soon as possible
and if i am unable
to bring aman back to our country
from kyrgyzstan within 24 hours
then there may be one more blast
i hope you understand spider
listen panther
i understand that
the method of our work
is different
so our ways are different too
but we both work
for our country dont we
today let me say it
once more for our country
if our heart beats then
jai hind
if we breathe then
jai hind
if we bleed then
jai hind
