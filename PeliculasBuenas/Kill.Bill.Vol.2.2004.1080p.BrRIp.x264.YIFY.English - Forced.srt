1
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:13,300
Master...

2
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:16,860
Your Mandarin is lousy.

3
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:21,239
It causes my ears discomfort.
You bray like an ass!

4
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:23,780
You are not to speak unless spoken to.

5
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:28,300
Is it too much to hope...
you understand Cantonese?

6
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:33,420
I speak Japanese very well...

7
00:47:33,927 --> 00:47:39,060
I didn't ask if you speak Japanese...
I asked if you understand Cantonese?

8
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:46,860
You are here to learn the mysteries
of Kung Fu, not linguistics.

9
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:49,340
If you can't understand me...

10
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:51,946
I will communicate with you
like l would a dog.

11
00:47:52,146 --> 00:47:55,105
When l yell, when l point,
when l beat you with my stick!

12
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:02,660
Bill is your master, is he not?

13
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:12,180
Your master tells me...
you're not entirely unschooled.

14
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,500
What training do you possess?

15
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,980
The exquisite art of the Samurai sword.
Don't make me laugh!

16
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:31,100
Your so-called exquisite art,
is only fit for...

17
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:33,020
Japanese fat heads!

18
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:43,340
Your anger amuses me.
Do you believe you are my match?

19
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:44,975
No.

20
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,260
Are you aware l kill at will?

21
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:48,980
Yes.

22
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,900
Is it your wish to die?

23
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,566
No.

24
00:48:54,430 --> 00:48:57,048
Then you must be stupid... so stupid.

25
00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:00,980
Rise, and let me look at your
ridiculous face.

26
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,660
Rise.

27
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:12,820
So my pathetic friend...
ls there anything that you can do well?

28
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,660
What's the matter?

29
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:17,980
Cat got your tongue?

30
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,420
- Oh yes, you speak Japanese.

31
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,500
I despise the Goddamn Japs!

32
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,260
Go to that rack.

33
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:39,103
Remove the sword.

34
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,660
Let's see how good you really are.

35
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,180
If...

36
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:11,580
... you land a single blow,

37
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,020
I'll bow down and call you master.

38
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,660
From here you can get
an excellent view of my foot.

39
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:40,220
Your swordsmanship...
is amateur at best.

40
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:59,700
Your so-called kung-fu... is really...
quite pathetic.

41
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:06,380
I asked you to demonstrate...
what you know... and you did...

42
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,300
Not a goddamn thing!

43
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:12,940
Let's see your Tiger Crane...
match my Eagle's Claw.

44
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,140
Like all Yankee women...

45
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:15,660
... all you can do is order in restaurants
and spend a man's money.

46
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:18,460
Excruciating... isn't it?

47
00:52:18,461 --> 00:52:20,023
Yes!

48
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:22,660
If it was my wish...

49
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,540
... l could chop your arm off.

50
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:29,620
It's my arm now. l can do what l please.

51
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:32,500
If you can stop me... l suggest you try.

52
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:35,700
I can't.

53
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:38,100
Because you're helpless?

54
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:40,538
Yes.

55
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,620
Have you ever felt this before?

56
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:46,562
No.

57
00:52:46,762 --> 00:52:49,540
Compared to me... you're as helpless
as a worm fighting an eagle?

58
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:51,740
YES!!!

59
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:55,362
THAT'S THE BEGlNNlNG!

60
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:03,060
Is it your wish to possess
this kind of power?

61
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,620
Your training will begin... tomorrow.

62
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:21,860
Since your arm now belongs to me...

63
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:24,060
... l want it strong.

64
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,020
Can you do that?

65
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:30,380
I can, but not that close.

66
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:31,820
Then you can't do it.

67
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:36,860
What if your enemy...
is three inches in front of you...

68
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:39,220
... What do you do then...

69
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,460
... Curl into a ball...

70
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:44,380
... or do you put your FlST through him?

71
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:47,020
Now begin.

72
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,710
It's the wood that should
fear your hand...

73
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:22,980
- not the other way around.

74
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:28,060
No wonder you can't do it...
you acquiesce to defeat...

75
00:54:29,078 --> 00:54:30,215
- before you even begin.

76
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:20,300
If you want to eat like a dog...

77
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:23,620
You can live and sleep
outside like a dog.

78
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,020
If you want to live and sleep
like a human...

79
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:31,100
... pick up those sticks.

80
01:18:23,460 --> 01:18:26,940
Elle, you treacherous dog.

81
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,820
l - give - you - my - word...
