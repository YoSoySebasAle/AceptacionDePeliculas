1
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:24,815
When I think of my wife...

2
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:29,697
I always think of her head.

3
00:00:31,157 --> 00:00:33,952
I picture cracking her lovely skull...

4
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:36,246
unspooling her brains...

5
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:39,040
trying to get answers.

6
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,628
The primal questions of any marriage.

7
00:00:43,795 --> 00:00:46,005
"What are you thinking?"

8
00:00:46,172 --> 00:00:48,299
"How are you feeling?"

9
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:51,094
"What have we done to each other?"

10
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:30,068
The Irish prince
graces us with his presence.

11
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:34,864
His majesty prefers not to be moistened.

12
00:02:36,074 --> 00:02:37,367
I got you a present.

13
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:40,351
- I hated this game.
- You loved it.

14
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:41,621
You loved it.

15
00:02:41,788 --> 00:02:44,082
Thank you.
I'll add it to the collection.

16
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:47,043
Can you pour me a bourbon?

17
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:55,385
What's up, Jitters?

18
00:02:59,097 --> 00:03:01,307
Well, if you're not going to talk,
I'm gonna have to fill the silence...

19
00:03:01,474 --> 00:03:04,727
with another excruciating story
by Margo Dunne.

20
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:07,438
I could tell you about
my recent customer service experience...

21
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:09,482
- changing Internet service providers.
- I like that one.

22
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:12,402
Or how about the time I saw that woman
who looked exactly like my friend Monica?

23
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:14,368
But it wasn't Monica.
It was a total stranger.

24
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:16,447
Who was also named Monica.

25
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:18,626
- Made it kind of interesting.
- It's great.

26
00:03:19,242 --> 00:03:20,451
I'm just having a bad day.

27
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:22,453
- Amy?
- It's our anniversary.

28
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,455
- Five years.
- Five?

29
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:25,665
That came fast.

30
00:03:25,832 --> 00:03:27,166
And furious.

31
00:03:31,713 --> 00:03:34,799
I'm so crazy, stupid happy.

32
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:38,970
I met a boy.

33
00:03:39,137 --> 00:03:43,558
A great, sweet, gorgeous, cool-ass guy.

34
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:46,978
Excuse me, miss?

35
00:03:47,145 --> 00:03:48,479
I just want you to be careful...

36
00:03:48,646 --> 00:03:51,315
where you put down that
monk-brewed Belgian wheat beer...

37
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:54,068
because the party's down to three
Beast Lights and a bottle of Pucker.

38
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:55,915
It might attract
some desperate characters.

39
00:03:55,987 --> 00:03:58,823
It could.
I mean, the Amish are on a Rumspringa.

40
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,329
They already relieved me
of my artisanal meat platter.

41
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:08,249
Finally, someone tells me
how to pronounce that word.

42
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,416
"Meat"?

43
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:10,668
Yes, "meat. " One syllable.

44
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:13,546
Thank you. Whose beer am I
about to drink?

45
00:04:13,713 --> 00:04:15,006
Don't tell me.

46
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,341
Let's see, who's your type?

47
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,718
I don't see you sitting quietly...

48
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:22,346
while he bloviates
on his postgrad thesis about Proust.

49
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,682
Uh-Oh. Ls that him?

50
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:27,130
Ironic hipster, so self-aware,
he makes everything a joke.

51
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:30,354
I prefer men who are funny, not "funny. "

52
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,399
What type are you?

53
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:34,901
Corn-fed,
salt-of-the-earth Missouri guy.

54
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,068
Missouri?

55
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:37,028
Cute.

56
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:39,405
- Native New Yorker?
- The world ends at the Hudson.

57
00:04:39,572 --> 00:04:40,572
What's your name?

58
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:41,698
Amy.

59
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,035
Well, Amy, who are you?

60
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:48,414
A, I'm an award-winning scrimshander.

61
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:52,627
B, I'm a moderately influential warlord.

62
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:55,922
C, I write personality quizzes
for magazines.

63
00:04:56,297 --> 00:05:00,384
Okay. Your hands are far too delicate
for real scrimshaw work...

64
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:03,679
and I happen to be a charter subscriber
to Middling Warlord Weekly...

65
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:05,056
so I'd recognize you.

66
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:06,599
I'm gonna go with.

67
00:05:06,766 --> 00:05:08,184
And you?

68
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:10,436
Who are you?

69
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:14,941
I'm the guy to save you
from all this awesomeness.

70
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:21,739
So, you write for a men's magazine.

71
00:05:21,906 --> 00:05:25,034
God, does that make you an expert
on being a man?

72
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:26,285
No.

73
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:28,398
It's what to wear, what to drink.

74
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:30,248
How to bullshit.

75
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:31,874
Never with you.

76
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:32,750
Ha, ha.

77
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:34,418
No, I mean it.

78
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,254
It's hard to believe you.

79
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,088
Why?

80
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:38,756
I think it's your chin.

81
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:39,924
My Chin?

82
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:42,635
Yeah, it's quite villainous.

83
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:44,428
Okay, how's this?

84
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:48,599
A hundred percent true, no bullshit.

85
00:05:48,975 --> 00:05:49,975
Okay.

86
00:05:49,976 --> 00:05:51,435
We all move to New York...

87
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:55,606
and we end up living in these little
cubby holes, and that's not it.

88
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:59,235
Come outside. Then, you're in it.

89
00:06:01,654 --> 00:06:03,406
You have to see this.

90
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:12,957
Hey.

91
00:06:13,082 --> 00:06:14,082
Hey.

92
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,677
I have to kiss you now.

93
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:26,137
Is that right?

94
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:29,473
I can't let you go through
a sugar storm unkissed.

95
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:32,476
Wait a second.

96
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,647
There you go.

97
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:49,994
Nick Dunne...

98
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:53,831
I really like you.

99
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:02,256
So, is Amy gonna do
one of those anniversary...

100
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:04,383
treasure hunts?

101
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,427
You mean the forced march
designed to prove...

102
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:09,430
what an oblivious and uncaring asshole
her husband is?

103
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:10,681
Wow.

104
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:15,102
Life. I don't remember the point.

105
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,355
Deep Hasbro thoughts.

106
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:18,856
Spin.

107
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,776
What was the clue last year
she got so mad about?

108
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:25,112
When your poor Amy has a cold...

109
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,864
this dessert just must be sold.

110
00:07:27,031 --> 00:07:28,031
The answer?

111
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:29,700
I still don't know the answer, Go.

112
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,911
- A few years ago, you'd have known.
- A few years ago, it was fun.

113
00:07:32,078 --> 00:07:33,678
Year one,
the traditional gift was paper.

114
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:37,124
She got me a beautiful notebook.
Told me to go write my novel.

115
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:38,042
What did you get her?

116
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:39,460
A kite.

117
00:07:39,627 --> 00:07:41,462
- She'd never flown a kite.
- Okay.

118
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:44,882
Anyway. Year four, flowers.

119
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:48,302
She led me outside
to the dying rosebush in the backyard.

120
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:49,636
That's symbolic.

121
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,720
Yeah.

122
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:52,056
What's the gift for five?

123
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:52,890
Wood.

124
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:55,417
- So, what did you get her?
- There's no good gift for wood.

125
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,771
I know! Go home, fuck her brains out,
slap her with your penis.

126
00:07:58,938 --> 00:08:00,398
"There's some wood for you, bitch. "

127
00:08:03,943 --> 00:08:05,236
The Bar.

128
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:08,280
Why, yes. Hang on one second.

129
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,615
Hey, it's Watchful Wally.

130
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:13,911
Hey, Walt. What's going on?

131
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:19,375
Thanks very much. I'll be right there.
All right, bye-bye.

132
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:34,265
Hey, buddy. What are you doing out here?

133
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:36,976
Thanks, Walt!

134
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:54,035
Ame?

135
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:15,848
Amy!

136
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:29,527
Hello?

137
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:31,155
Come on in.

138
00:09:31,906 --> 00:09:32,573
Hey.

139
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,033
- Mister Dunne.
- Hi.

140
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,577
I'm Detective Rhonda Boney.
This is Officer James Gilpin.

141
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:38,664
We understand there are concerns
about your wife.

142
00:09:38,746 --> 00:09:42,666
I don't know where my wife is.
And I came home to this.

143
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:46,504
Now, I don't panic easily...

144
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:48,923
but it's weird, right?

145
00:09:50,174 --> 00:09:51,175
Mind if we look around?

146
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:52,218
Please.

147
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:53,664
How long have you two been here?

148
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,388
Two years in September.
We used to live in New York.

149
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:57,555
City?

150
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:00,684
Yeah, I was a writer.
We were both writers.

151
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:02,353
Why did you all move back here?

152
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,021
My mom got sick.

153
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:07,024
Oh, I'm sorry. How is she?

154
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:08,526
She's dead.

155
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:09,693
I'm so sorry.

156
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,701
What do you do now, for work?

157
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,412
My sister Margo and I
own The Bar downtown.

158
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:22,581
Oh, The Bar.

159
00:10:22,748 --> 00:10:24,875
Love the name. Very meta.

160
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,127
Thanks.

161
00:10:29,088 --> 00:10:30,881
Pretty things.

162
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:36,846
Stay.

163
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:38,764
My office, here.

164
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:43,853
Beautiful dress.

165
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:48,524
Date night?

166
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:49,942
It's our anniversary.

167
00:10:53,112 --> 00:10:54,613
It's a guest bedroom, there.

168
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:56,407
Cat's room on the end.

169
00:10:56,574 --> 00:10:58,117
I checked up here.

170
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:03,496
This is the kitchen...

171
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:04,957
obviously.

172
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:22,433
This is my wife's office.

173
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,226
Amy's office.

174
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:40,284
Wow. Impressive gal.

175
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,487
Yeah. Should I be concerned?

176
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:42,786
I remember these.

177
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:45,289
I loved these books.

178
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,753
Wait a minute.

179
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,922
Your wife is Amazing Amy?

180
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,716
Yeah. She is.

181
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:57,509
Wow.

182
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:04,016
Amazing-fucking-Amy
is getting fucking married.

183
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:05,851
That's how the night started.

184
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:12,066
<i>With me, regular, flawed, real Amy,
jealous, as always, of the golden child.</i>

185
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:16,737
Perfect, brilliant, Amazing Amy,
who's getting fucking married.

186
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:18,739
When I was 10, I quit cello.

187
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:22,493
In the next book,
Amazing Amy became a prodigy.

188
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:25,954
Did you play volleyball?

189
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,748
I got cut, freshman year.

190
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:29,833
She made varsity.

191
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:33,128
When did you have a dog?

192
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:34,296
She got the dog.

193
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:37,299
Puddles made her more relatable.

194
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:38,676
Wow.

195
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,844
I love your parents...

196
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,680
but they really can be assholes.

197
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,181
- Nick!
- Sir!

198
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,016
Hey, thanks for coming, man.

199
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:46,850
No problem.

200
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,435
Hey, sweetheart.

201
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:50,312
Big night for your mom.

202
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:54,191
It would mean so much
if you would talk to a few reporters...

203
00:12:54,358 --> 00:12:56,110
bloggers, give them a little Amy color.

204
00:12:56,277 --> 00:12:58,028
People wanna hear from you.

205
00:12:58,195 --> 00:12:59,697
- We can't stay long.
- Fantastic.

206
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,032
Fifteen minutes, tops.

207
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:06,537
This is why I have my brownstone.
My trust fund. I know I can't complain.

208
00:13:06,704 --> 00:13:09,206
Your parents literally
plagiarized your childhood.

209
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:13,294
No, they improved upon it,
and then peddled it to the masses.

210
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,546
I thought you were gonna wear white
to match the wedding theme.

211
00:13:15,713 --> 00:13:17,047
I thought that would be creepy.

212
00:13:17,214 --> 00:13:19,550
"If it's worth doing,
it's worth doing... "

213
00:13:19,717 --> 00:13:21,927
Hold up! I know how this ends.
Don't tell me.

214
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:23,762
You're very cute, Nick.

215
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:25,569
Amy, you know
what would make Dad's night.

216
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,224
I'm on it.

217
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:31,395
I love having strangers
pick at my scabs.

218
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:32,688
I'm curious whether...

219
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:34,565
it's difficult for you to see
Amazing Amy heading down the aisle.

220
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,901
And this big party
celebrating this fictional wedding.

221
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:40,279
Because it's my understanding
you are not married.

222
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:42,114
Is that correct?

223
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:46,702
Correct. Amazing Amy has always been
one step ahead of me.

224
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:50,706
Excuse me. I'm sorry,
I just have a few questions.

225
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:51,874
It's you.

226
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,585
I'm here in a
strictly journalistic capacity.

227
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:58,088
Now, you had the distinct pleasure
of dating Nick Dunne for how long?

228
00:13:58,255 --> 00:14:00,924
- Two magical years.
- Two magical years.

229
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,801
In the course of that time,
you've had the opportunity...

230
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:05,304
to perform such gracious gestures as...

231
00:14:05,471 --> 00:14:09,266
not correcting Nick when he
pronounced "quinoa" as "kween-o-a. "

232
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:10,768
An understandable mistake.

233
00:14:10,934 --> 00:14:12,134
He also thought it was a fish.

234
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:13,729
He thinks Velveeta is a cheese.

235
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:16,940
You also manage to appear
shocked and delighted...

236
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:19,627
when Nick's elderly mother
breaks into an impromptu rendition...

237
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:21,820
of New York, New York,
every time she sees you.

238
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:23,906
These bag of bone shoes.

239
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:25,115
That's just frightening.

240
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:27,785
You also bought Nick
his very first pair of scissors.

241
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:29,495
And matching stapler.

242
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:32,456
Amy Elliott, you are more than amazing.

243
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:36,001
You are brilliant,
yet entirely un-snobby.

244
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:39,671
You challenge me. You surprise me.

245
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:41,173
And, fun fact for the readers...

246
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,300
you have a world-class vagina.

247
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:48,430
My colleagues tell me
that you are not yet married.

248
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,641
Is that correct?

249
00:14:50,808 --> 00:14:52,142
I'm not.

250
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:53,644
Isn't it time we fixed that?

251
00:14:55,104 --> 00:14:56,647
And then...

252
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:59,650
<i>the night wasn't so bad anymore.</i>

253
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:18,377
And it's done. Crossed off the list.

254
00:15:18,544 --> 00:15:22,381
Now, normally, we would not treat this
as a missing persons case so quick...

255
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:23,988
but given the scene at your house...

256
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:26,009
and given our spike
in violent crime of late...

257
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:28,512
we are gonna take this
very, very seriously.

258
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:29,679
Okay. Good.

259
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,850
We've got forensics over at your place.
You got somewhere to stay?

260
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,496
- I could stay at my sister's.
- Okay.

261
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:36,812
We're tracking Amy's phone,
her credit cards.

262
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:38,579
We will organize searches,
put up flyers.

263
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:40,322
We're gonna hold a press
conference tomorrow.

264
00:15:40,334 --> 00:15:41,567
You're having a
press conference?

265
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,193
I wanna get the word out, right?

266
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,656
Yeah, it's just all of a sudden,
I feel like I'm on a Law & Order episode.

267
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:57,749
Time is of the essence in these cases.

268
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,544
But, that said,
do you wanna wait and call a lawyer?

269
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:01,712
Absolutely not. I just wanna help.

270
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:03,547
So, you and Amy
have been here two years.

271
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:06,842
- You tend bar...
- I own The Bar.

272
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:10,387
And I teach creative writing at MVCC.

273
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:12,222
- No kids?
- Not yet.

274
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:13,724
So, what does Amy do most days?

275
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:16,101
A woman with all those degrees,
what does she do?

276
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:17,895
I don't know. She keeps busy.

277
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:19,563
Doing what?

278
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,275
She's a voracious reader.

279
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:26,278
So, she's always got a book in her hand.

280
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:28,697
Well, days can get long.

281
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:32,576
I know a few housewives, that evening
glass of wine starts coming at noon.

282
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:33,911
Or prescription pills.

283
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,517
Just last week, we had a soccer mom.

284
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:37,956
Nice lady. Got her teeth kicked in
over some OxyContin.

285
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:40,083
Ever since that mall went bust,
half the town is out of work.

286
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,585
We cannot keep up
with the drug violence.

287
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:44,087
I'm pretty sure that's not it.

288
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:46,089
Has Amy got friends we can talk to?

289
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:49,259
No, not really.

290
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:51,261
No friends? This whole town?

291
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:54,932
She was very close with my mom,
before she passed away.

292
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:57,218
You know, we have a pretty serious
homeless problem...

293
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,393
in our neighborhood.

294
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:00,487
I think maybe you guys
should check that out.

295
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:02,772
We'll look into that.

296
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:05,317
You got to The Bar around 11:00 today.

297
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:06,944
Where were you before that?
Just to cross that out.

298
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,110
Well, I was home.

299
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:10,614
I left at 9:30,
I got a cup of coffee, a newspaper.

300
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:12,381
I went to Sawyer Beach
and read the news.

301
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,493
Did you visit with anyone there?

302
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,620
I kind of go to Sawyer Beach
for the solitude.

303
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:20,249
So, your wife has no friends here.

304
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:22,125
Is she kinda standoffish?

305
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,586
Ivy League? Rubs people the wrong way?

306
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:26,255
She's from New York.

307
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:30,634
She's complicated.
She's got very high standards.

308
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:31,801
Type A?

309
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:34,429
That can make you crazy
if you're not like that.

310
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:37,307
You seem pretty laid-back. Type B.

311
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:39,643
Speaking of which, Amy's blood type?

312
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:41,853
God, I don't know.
I'd have to look it up at the house.

313
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,690
You don't know if she has friends,
you don't know what she does all day...

314
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,650
and you don't know
your wife's blood type.

315
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:47,943
Sure you all are married?

316
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:50,695
Maybe it's type O.

317
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:52,781
- Where are her folks? New York?
- Yeah.

318
00:17:52,948 --> 00:17:54,533
Can they get here time
for this press conference tomorrow?

319
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,700
Tomorrow? I have no idea.
I haven't talked to them.

320
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,495
You haven't called
your wife's parents yet?

321
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:00,956
You can't get a signal in this building.
I've been in here talking to you.

322
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:03,458
Call them, please, Nick. Now.

323
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:04,835
Fine.

324
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,259
Should I know my wife's blood type?

325
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:13,343
No.

326
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:17,347
Maybe it's type O.

327
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:18,890
Now I'm at the station...

328
00:18:19,057 --> 00:18:22,561
and the cops are at the house,
and it's serious and I'm calling you.

329
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:26,106
There's a lot of things
that are being juggled right now.

330
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:29,401
I'm standing right next to
Detective Rhonda Boney...

331
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:31,528
who's the lead investigator on this
and she's...

332
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,949
My mother-in-law
would like to speak with you.

333
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:38,535
This is Detective Boney.

334
00:18:38,702 --> 00:18:39,911
I wanna go home.

335
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:42,414
I don't know why I have to be here.

336
00:18:42,581 --> 00:18:45,083
I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home.

337
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,376
Dad?

338
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,253
This is my father. What's going on?

339
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,463
Really? You're Nick Dunne?

340
00:18:49,713 --> 00:18:51,590
We've been trying to get a hold of you
all afternoon.

341
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:53,397
I've been right there.
My wife is missing.

342
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:54,468
- Bfich.
- Doni.

343
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:56,887
Your father wandered out of Comfort Hill
after lunch.

344
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:59,306
We found him walking Route 79,
disoriented.

345
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:00,807
We've been trying to call you
for the last...

346
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,100
I don't get a cell signal
in this building.

347
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:04,227
I've been sitting
20 feet away from you.

348
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:06,161
Sir, please
don't take that tone with me.

349
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:07,230
Stupid, dumb, ugly bitch.

350
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:08,940
Dad, stop.

351
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,819
You wanna drive him home?

352
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:15,781
I think that would be wise. Thanks.

353
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:38,428

354
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:40,346
Fuck.

355
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:44,935
Get your fucking hands off me.

356
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:46,478
Thanks.

357
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:03,328
Everyone told us
and told us and told us...

358
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:05,956
marriage is hard work.

359
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:09,042
And compromise and more work.

360
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,336
"Abandon all hope, ye who enter. "

361
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:14,297
"When young Amy's hope did wane... "

362
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:15,674
"she wandered here... "

363
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:18,218
Well, it's not true.
Not for me and Nick.

364
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:20,887
"... in search of Jane. "

365
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:23,974
With us, two years...

366
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:25,642
it's just good.

367
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:27,978
Austen.

368
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:33,483
You were an alienated teen
and only Elizabeth Bennet understood you.

369
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:35,986
Look at that.

370
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:39,197
My God.

371
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:40,866
You naughty minx.

372
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:43,994
Well, technically, we are supposed
to fuck at the next stop.

373
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:45,662
Yeah, in keeping with tradition.

374
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:49,207
But I might be willing
to bend the rules this once.

375
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:51,084
God bless Jane Austen.

376
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:10,437
I'm enthusiastic. Look at that.
It's confirmed by the...

377
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:15,692
Thank you.

378
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:18,195
Year two. Cotton.

379
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:29,080
We had that joke that our sex
was too good for ordinary.

380
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:31,708
So, these are 2,000 thread-count-

381
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:39,549
We're so cute.
I wanna punch us in the face.

382
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:42,928
That's pretty great.
I mean, that is pretty great.

383
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:45,827
Did they ask if you wanted a lawyer?

384
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:48,058
I don't need a lawyer.
Here, I'll do this.

385
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:50,393
Well, did they ask personal stuff
about Amy?

386
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,728
You know, they asked...

387
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:53,396
why didn't she have any friends?

388
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:54,272
What did you say?

389
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:56,441
- I said she was complicated.
- Nick!

390
00:21:57,442 --> 00:22:00,070
Everyone knows "complicated"
is code for "bitch. "

391
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:07,160
God. I feel sick.

392
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:08,745
Thanks.

393
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:10,914
It's so bizarre.

394
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:13,458
It seems like the kind of thing
that would happen to Amy.

395
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:14,668
She always attracts...

396
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:16,419
Drama?

397
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:18,505
You can say it. It's just me and you.

398
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:21,091
Just because
I don't like to be around Amy...

399
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:22,698
doesn't mean I don't care about her.

400
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:27,764
Anyway, whoever took her
is bound to bring her back.

401
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:39,025
Detective? Excuse me.

402
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,820
I'm Noelle Hawthorne.
I'm Amy's best friend.

403
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:45,615
Well, great. Where do you live, Noelle?

404
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:47,534
Five doors down. 1032.

405
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:49,786
Wonderful. I would love to talk to you.

406
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:51,705
Can I come by in half an hour?

407
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:53,456
- Y'all know anything yet?
- I'm sorry.

408
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:56,293
I got guys on the clock in here.
But you give me 30 minutes.

409
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:57,794
But that's usually bath time.

410
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:01,131
Well, we'll talk in between shampoos.

411
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:05,124
All right. So, what do you got?

412
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:07,846
It was definitely blood spatter
you saw in the kitchen.

413
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:09,890
Normally, kitchen, knives, food prep.

414
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:12,309
Not that weird,
but that is awfully high.

415
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:13,977
So, I'm gonna order a luminol sweep.

416
00:23:14,144 --> 00:23:15,312
Well, okay.

417
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:19,023
Interesting.

418
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:20,150
What's that?

419
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:23,695
House is rented in her name.
Car's in her name.

420
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:26,865
Credit cards, utilities,
phone bill, all in her name.

421
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:28,742
Even his bar's in her name.

422
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:30,702
I don't know that that's so surprising.

423
00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:32,370
No. But it is humiliating.

424
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:33,330
What you got?

425
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:36,333
It's with her unmentionables.

426
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:51,556
Well, we have our first clue.

427
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:04,194
I have to take a shower.

428
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:06,029
No, don't. You've been up all night.

429
00:24:06,196 --> 00:24:08,365
You wanna look
like you've been up all night.

430
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:12,202
Hey, be careful today, okay?

431
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:13,578
That's a weird thing to say.

432
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:17,374
Well, when you're upset, you bottle up.
You can seem angry, like...

433
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,917
Please don't say, "Like Dad. "

434
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:21,711
Or else you swing into your momma's-boy
charm offensive and that can feel glib.

435
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:22,545
Perfect.

436
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:25,340
I'll balance on the exact fucking edge
of your emotional razor.

437
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:27,217
Okay. Just be...

438
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:29,177
myself?

439
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:31,554
Sponsoring a raffle to
benefit West County 4H...

440
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:35,058
and raffling season tickets for
Mizzou football.

441
00:24:35,225 --> 00:24:38,520
Buy your tickets at the Wing Hut or
local Tri-State Tire stores.

442
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:44,442
Your in-laws made it.

443
00:24:46,444 --> 00:24:47,444
- Hi, Rand.
- Hey, man.

444
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:48,238
I'm Detective Boney.

445
00:24:48,405 --> 00:24:50,240
I'm the twin. Margo.

446
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:53,368
We played tennis yesterday, Nick.
I just can't get over it.

447
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:54,744
Marybeth, I am really sorry.

448
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:56,671
I knew you never should have
moved back here.

449
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:57,747
We didn't have a lot of choice.

450
00:24:57,914 --> 00:25:01,459
We are all worried. We are all scared.

451
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:06,089
But we are all here now.
And we will find Amy, together.

452
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:18,101
Should I just go first, and then
you guys can say something?

453
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:19,268
Good.

454
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:25,108
As you know, my wife,
Amy Elliott Dunne...

455
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:28,069
disappeared from our home
on the morning of July 5th...

456
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:31,448
under suspicious circumstances.

457
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:32,949
Louder!

458
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:37,370
If anyone out there
has any information...

459
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:39,789
please come forward.

460
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:41,583
Thank you.

461
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:46,629
I'm Rand Elliott.
My wife, Marybeth Elliott.

462
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:47,881
Should I have said my name?

463
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:50,300
Amy is our only child.

464
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:54,471
She's bright, she's beautiful.
She's kind.

465
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:56,473
She really is Amazing Amy.

466
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:59,392
You know, there are
millions of people out there...

467
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:01,978
who grew up with her and care about her.

468
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:04,773
We care about her, we love her.

469
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:08,068
And we just want her back.

470
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:12,489
Amy is a decorated scholar.

471
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:15,492
She forged a successful career
in journalism.

472
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:17,827
She returned here
to her husband's hometown...

473
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:20,330
and she made a life in her adopted home.

474
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:23,666
Now, Amy needs your help.

475
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:27,837
We're establishing a volunteer
headquarters at the Drury Lodge.

476
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:33,343
We have a hotline, 1-855-4-AMY-TIPS.

477
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:39,015
And our website is
www. FindAmazingAmy. com.

478
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:41,476
- Mr. Dunne!
- Mr. Elliott!

479
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:44,687
Mr. Dunne, any signs of foul play?

480
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:50,110
Mr. Elliott, when was the last time
you spoke to your daughter?

481
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:52,612
Smile.

482
00:26:59,202 --> 00:27:00,787
That's all for now. Thank you.

483
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:06,084
Amy is the kind of girl
who attracts admirers.

484
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:07,001
Right, Nick?

485
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:08,211
Yeah, definitely.

486
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:10,755
And we've had instances...

487
00:27:10,922 --> 00:27:12,841
- where things got...
- Scary.

488
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:14,342
Do you know about Desi Collings?

489
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:16,052
Yeah, I know all about Desi Collings.

490
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:17,345
He was obsessed.

491
00:27:17,512 --> 00:27:20,723
He attempted suicide after Amy
broke up with him sophomore year.

492
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,308
We had to file a restraining order.

493
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:24,727
This would be high school?
Twenty years ago?

494
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:27,981
But he recently moved to St. Louis.
That's just two hours away.

495
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:29,899
To be fair, he is from St. Louis.

496
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:31,568
We also have Tommy O'Hara.

497
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:33,820
This is only eight years ago,
in New York.

498
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:36,156
She broke up with him,
he got very physical.

499
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,002
- She filed charges.
- What was the charge?

500
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:39,993
Sexual assault, threat, battery, what?

501
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,995
I only know it was bad.

502
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:43,830
- I didn't know this.
- Okay.

503
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:45,790
Thank you.

504
00:27:45,957 --> 00:27:47,250
Anything more recent?

505
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:52,589
Not that I know of.

506
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:57,969
Hey, Nick? You got a minute?

507
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:00,763
Yeah.

508
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:07,395
Imagine our confusion.

509
00:28:07,562 --> 00:28:08,605
A missing persons case...

510
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:11,232
and in your wife's dressing room,
we find an envelope marked "clue. "

511
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:13,526
That's for our anniversary.

512
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:15,862
My wife does these treasure hunts.

513
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:18,281
I'm hoping you can tell me
what this means.

514
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:19,449
You want to solve Amy's treasure hunt?

515
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:22,186
It'll help me track Amy's movements
before she disappeared.

516
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,454
Of course. Okay.

517
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:27,207
"Although this spot
couldn't be tighter... "

518
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:30,668
"it's a cozy room
for my favorite writer. "

519
00:28:33,504 --> 00:28:34,714
I know this one!

520
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:38,718
Although this spot
couldn't be any tighter...

521
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:42,138
it's a cozy room for my favorite writer.

522
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,935
After-school meeting,
don't mind if I do.

523
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:50,021
Maybe I'll teach you a thing or two.

524
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:56,277
Well, well. What does it say?

525
00:28:56,444 --> 00:28:57,946
Clue two.

526
00:28:59,072 --> 00:29:02,450
"Hey, handsome man, let's go undercover.

527
00:29:02,951 --> 00:29:06,829
"You'll be the spy,
and I'll be his lover. "

528
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,331
"Let's head on over... "

529
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,166
"to the little brown house. "

530
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:14,045
"We'll play hot, doting husband,
sweet, loving spouse. "

531
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,090
These yours?

532
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:19,716
No.

533
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:21,094
But you read the first clue.

534
00:29:21,261 --> 00:29:24,264
Randy professor, naughty student.

535
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,430
I blush.

536
00:29:25,515 --> 00:29:27,267
Me and my ex just swapped cards.

537
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:29,756
Where's this little brown house?

538
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:31,396
I have no idea.

539
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:15,982
Hello?

540
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:18,526
Nicholas Dunne.

541
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:22,280
Under my father's name, William Dunne.

542
00:30:28,703 --> 00:30:32,665
My wife's first pet? Ls this necessary?
Can you just turn the bell...

543
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:33,832
Yeah, I know.

544
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,460
It's... It's...

545
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,214
It's "Puddles," right?
Or is it "Poodles?"

546
00:30:44,135 --> 00:30:45,762
We're good.

547
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:48,348
Hello, stranger.

548
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,516
Fancy meeting you here.

549
00:30:50,683 --> 00:30:52,852
It's your dad's house, right?

550
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:54,520
Are you following me?

551
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:55,438
What you doing?

552
00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:57,648
Like you said, it's my dad's house.

553
00:30:57,815 --> 00:31:00,526
I come by once a week,
make sure the place hasn't burned down.

554
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,613
But it looks okay.

555
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:06,240
I'll walk you out.

556
00:31:09,494 --> 00:31:10,870
You know...

557
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:14,165
I thought maybe
this was the little brown house.

558
00:31:14,332 --> 00:31:15,416
From the clue.

559
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,543
Nope. Still blue.

560
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:38,106
Picture me,
I'm a girl who's very, very bad.

561
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:41,984
I need to be punished,
and by "punished," I mean "had. "

562
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:45,613
It's where you keep goodies
for anniversary five.

563
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:49,659
"So open the door, and look alive. "

564
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:51,994
Bitch!

565
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:58,709
Want to test your marriage
for weak spots?

566
00:31:59,377 --> 00:32:00,837
Add one recession...

567
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,463
subtract two jobs.

568
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:05,049
It's surprisingly effective.

569
00:32:05,216 --> 00:32:07,510
Promise me we'll never be like them.

570
00:32:07,677 --> 00:32:08,678
Like who?

571
00:32:08,845 --> 00:32:10,471
All those awful couples we know.

572
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:14,475
Those wives who treat their men
like dancing monkeys...

573
00:32:14,642 --> 00:32:16,102
to be trained and paraded.

574
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:19,439
Husbands who treat their wives
like the highway patrol...

575
00:32:19,814 --> 00:32:22,400
to be out-foxed and avoided.

576
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:28,823
I think I'm gonna be laid off.

577
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:32,285
We're in a recession.
If it happens, we'll deal with it.

578
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:34,537
I'll probably be next.

579
00:32:34,704 --> 00:32:35,955
We have each other.

580
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,875
Everything else is background noise.

581
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:41,752
You are exceptional.

582
00:32:49,469 --> 00:32:50,720
My turn.

583
00:32:52,597 --> 00:32:55,933
My parents' publisher dropped them,
and they're in debt up to their ears.

584
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:56,809
That's terrible.

585
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:59,270
And they need to borrow
from my trust fund.

586
00:32:59,437 --> 00:33:00,813
How much?

587
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,191
Almost a million.

588
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:05,234
That's almost all of it.

589
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:07,570
This is where you say,
"Everything else is background noise. "

590
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:08,777
Amy, if you're laid off...

591
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:10,072
and I'm laid off...

592
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:11,240
I said I'd do it.

593
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:12,533
Without talking to me?

594
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,160
- Well, it's...
- Your call.

595
00:33:14,327 --> 00:33:15,912
Their money, technically.

596
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,001
You know what? You're right.

597
00:33:22,627 --> 00:33:24,629
Everything else
is just background noise.

598
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:34,597
Hey.

599
00:33:38,726 --> 00:33:39,769
More games?

600
00:33:39,936 --> 00:33:41,562
Yeah, I just wanted to shoot some folks.

601
00:33:42,772 --> 00:33:44,232
What's the laptop for?

602
00:33:45,316 --> 00:33:46,317
Laptop-ing.

603
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:49,362
I see.

604
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:52,532
You can give your parents $879,000
without talking to me...

605
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:55,674
but God forbid I buy a video game
without getting your permission.

606
00:33:55,743 --> 00:33:56,743
You are spending a lot.

607
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:58,955
You don't trust me.
You don't trust my judgment.

608
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,681
You certainly don't trust my intention.

609
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:01,541
What are you talking about?

610
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,209
That's the basic tenet
of a prenup, isn't it?

611
00:34:03,376 --> 00:34:05,503
Why are you throwing that
in my face again?

612
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,088
Because it's easy to throw.

613
00:34:07,255 --> 00:34:07,922
Nick, I don't get it.

614
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:11,300
I don't get why you're daring me
to be someone I don't wanna be.

615
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:14,428
The nagging shrew.
The controlling bitch.

616
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:16,847
I'm not that person. I'm your wife.

617
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:18,057
I'm sorry.

618
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:20,544
I just don't know how to do this.
I've never not had a job.

619
00:34:20,601 --> 00:34:22,478
I flipped burgers, I painted houses.

620
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:24,647
You'll get another job.

621
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:30,278
Hi, Go.

622
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:33,656
What? Hold on. What?

623
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:35,116
- And suddenly...
- Slow down, what is it?

624
00:34:35,283 --> 00:34:37,159
L knew everything
was about to get worse.

625
00:34:37,326 --> 00:34:38,911
Okay, tell me what's wrong.

626
00:35:06,272 --> 00:35:07,773
- Bless you, Nick.
- Father.

627
00:35:08,441 --> 00:35:09,734
Hey, Tom. Mayor!

628
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,027
Nick, good to see you.

629
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:12,193
Good to see you.

630
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:13,487
Hey, guys, hey.

631
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:17,408
- Jodie.
- Nick.

632
00:35:19,118 --> 00:35:20,745
Oh, we'll find her.

633
00:35:35,718 --> 00:35:37,303
You look like hammered shit.

634
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,138
Thank you.

635
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:48,949
You ever see that guy
in the glasses before?

636
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:52,234
Don't worry. We videotape everybody
that comes in and out of these things.

637
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:54,070
I mean, you tend to get a lot of...

638
00:35:54,236 --> 00:35:55,236
Do-gooders?

639
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:56,405
Freaks.

640
00:35:56,572 --> 00:35:58,407
Hey, I meant to ask you.

641
00:35:58,574 --> 00:36:00,034
Noelle Hawthorne?

642
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,630
She lives on your street.
Amy's best friend.

643
00:36:03,746 --> 00:36:04,955
I've never heard the name
Noelle Hawthorne.

644
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:07,166
She and her husband have triplets.

645
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:08,333
Oh.

646
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:11,462
Yeah, we might say hi to them
on the street.

647
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:14,006
But "best friend"? No.

648
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:15,758
Excuse me, one sec.

649
00:36:20,054 --> 00:36:22,014
He acted like
Noelle was a complete stranger.

650
00:36:22,181 --> 00:36:23,265
Of course he did.

651
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:24,809
Look, these two are yours.

652
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:27,228
Oh, look. He's being a good guy...

653
00:36:27,395 --> 00:36:29,188
so everybody can see him
being a good guy.

654
00:36:29,355 --> 00:36:31,023
You really don't like him, do you?

655
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,692
What's to like?

656
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,883
This mailbox is currently full.
Press one to...

657
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:01,429
Nick? I just wanted to introduce myself.
My name's Shawna Kelly.

658
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:04,265
I am so sorry for your troubles.

659
00:37:04,432 --> 00:37:05,224
Thank you. That's kind.

660
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:06,684
Are you remembering to eat?

661
00:37:06,851 --> 00:37:07,852
Well, a lot of cold cuts.

662
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:12,064
I'm gonna fix you up
my world-famous chicken Frito pie.

663
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:13,751
That's very kind and very unnecessary.

664
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:15,401
You have to keep your strength.

665
00:37:15,943 --> 00:37:16,943
Would you...

666
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,697
say, "Chicken Frito pie!"

667
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,202
You know what?

668
00:37:26,454 --> 00:37:27,705
Would you delete that picture for me?

669
00:37:27,872 --> 00:37:29,623
- It's a nice photo.
- I know it is.

670
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,083
But just do me a favor.

671
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,877
Will you?

672
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:35,838
Would you go ahead
and please delete that picture?

673
00:37:36,005 --> 00:37:37,005
You just press...

674
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:38,424
What is wrong with you?

675
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:39,759
Could you please not
share that with anyone?

676
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:43,262
I will share it with whomever I please.

677
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,309
- Dude.
- Yeah?

678
00:37:48,476 --> 00:37:49,810
Marybeth is pissed.

679
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:51,519
Why?

680
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,649
Marybeth?

681
00:37:55,816 --> 00:37:59,236
It's like you're the goddamn
Homecoming King.

682
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:03,991
It was important to my mother
that I be polite...

683
00:38:04,158 --> 00:38:05,951
I be considerate, I be a gentleman.

684
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:07,703
It looked like you were having fun.

685
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:10,122
Lam in a nightmare!

686
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:13,125
All I'm trying to do is be nice...

687
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:17,004
to the people who are
volunteering to help find Amy.

688
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,716
You're right.

689
00:38:21,592 --> 00:38:23,552
And I'm sorry.

690
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:29,183
My God, this place literally
smells like feces.

691
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:43,364
In your searches,
did you find any golf clubs, real fancy?

692
00:38:43,531 --> 00:38:44,949
No.

693
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:47,660
How about a brand new Stratocaster?

694
00:38:47,827 --> 00:38:48,953
No, nothing like that.

695
00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:51,747
Well, all right.

696
00:38:56,752 --> 00:38:59,672
How big's that I V? It's not 65-inch.

697
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,006
No, it's nowhere near that.

698
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:02,258
Okay.

699
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:04,009
- Kibble?
- Excuse me?

700
00:39:04,176 --> 00:39:06,136
He asked me to feed his cat.

701
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:07,513
I saw some in the pantry.

702
00:39:07,847 --> 00:39:12,476
Detective Boney, Officer Gilpin?
Noelle Hawthorne!

703
00:39:12,643 --> 00:39:14,103
I know y'all are in there!

704
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:18,774
Would you please escort Miss Hawthorne
and her children back out to the street?

705
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:21,610
Detective Boney!

706
00:39:21,777 --> 00:39:25,614
Just remind her
it is a possible crime scene.

707
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:39,169
Look at that pie-eating grin,
from a guy whose wife is missing.

708
00:39:44,967 --> 00:39:46,552
- How are you doing?
- Terrific.

709
00:39:48,304 --> 00:39:49,680
How's Marybeth?

710
00:39:49,847 --> 00:39:51,557
She's a wreck.

711
00:39:51,724 --> 00:39:53,183
And you?

712
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:55,311
Awesome.

713
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:56,477
Hey...

714
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:58,063
have you told me everything?

715
00:39:58,314 --> 00:39:59,314
Of course.

716
00:39:59,315 --> 00:40:00,315
Everything?

717
00:40:00,316 --> 00:40:01,358
Why would you even ask me that?

718
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:05,696
Ever since you walked into The Bar that
morning Amy went missing, you seem...

719
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:07,990
- off.
- I am off.

720
00:40:09,033 --> 00:40:12,244
Everybody's examining me
and projecting their shit on me.

721
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:15,706
All I want is to come over here,
have a beer with you...

722
00:40:15,873 --> 00:40:17,082
and not be judged.

723
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:18,751
Can we do that?

724
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:21,170
Of course.

725
00:40:22,546 --> 00:40:24,423
You know what I keep thinking?

726
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,590
If Mom were here?

727
00:40:25,674 --> 00:40:29,094
Yeah. Like I'm 12.

728
00:40:30,554 --> 00:40:33,349
Nick, Mom would fix it.

729
00:40:40,564 --> 00:40:43,776
I'm gonna go Benadryl myself to sleep.

730
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:49,031
- Love you.
- Love you.

731
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:55,287
So, here's a strange, new sentence.

732
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:58,916
I am a Missourian.

733
00:41:05,714 --> 00:41:07,091
Bye, Dad.

734
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:12,346
No money, no jobs, no prospects.

735
00:41:12,513 --> 00:41:14,556
And then, we heard from Go.

736
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:16,517
Mama Maureen...

737
00:41:16,684 --> 00:41:19,520
Stage 4 breast cancer.

738
00:41:21,689 --> 00:41:24,400
So, we moved to Missouri.

739
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:26,068
I don't mind.

740
00:41:26,235 --> 00:41:29,405
I just wish he'd asked.

741
00:41:41,083 --> 00:41:43,502
Nick is happy to be home.

742
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:46,088
But I don't know
if he's happy I'm with him.

743
00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:50,718
I feel like something
he loaded by mistake.

744
00:41:50,884 --> 00:41:53,929
Something to be jettisoned,
if necessary.

745
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:56,306
Something disposable.

746
00:41:58,142 --> 00:42:00,769
I feel like I could disappear.

747
00:42:44,772 --> 00:42:46,648
Oh, my God!

748
00:42:46,815 --> 00:42:48,650
- I saw you on TV.
- Okay.

749
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:50,360
- It's so crazy.
- Yeah, I know.

750
00:42:50,527 --> 00:42:52,613
- She just vanished?
- She's just gone.

751
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,490
- I've been so worried about you.
- Where have you been?

752
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:56,366
I called you a hundred times.
You gotta pick up your phone!

753
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:57,533
Rehearsals.

754
00:42:57,618 --> 00:42:58,618
What?

755
00:42:58,702 --> 00:42:59,995
Godspell.

756
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:03,310
My sister's asleep in the other room.

757
00:43:03,457 --> 00:43:04,458
I needed to see you.

758
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:06,168
I know this is a bad idea.

759
00:43:06,335 --> 00:43:07,815
Can you at least tell me you love me?

760
00:43:07,878 --> 00:43:11,507
I do love you, but we have
to be really careful right now.

761
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:12,800
I've been so scared.

762
00:43:12,966 --> 00:43:14,051
Between rehearsals?

763
00:43:14,218 --> 00:43:15,844
You told me
I needed to have my own life.

764
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:17,387
I know.

765
00:43:17,554 --> 00:43:18,680
We need to stop.

766
00:43:18,847 --> 00:43:20,015
I need you.

767
00:43:21,141 --> 00:43:22,976
Touch me.

768
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:29,024
Stop it. Come here.

769
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,985
Sit down.

770
00:43:32,152 --> 00:43:33,362
Okay.

771
00:43:33,529 --> 00:43:37,491
Did you, by any chance,
tell anybody anything about us?

772
00:43:37,658 --> 00:43:39,034
Even in texting, or on Facebook.

773
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:41,870
Facebook? I use the disposable phone.

774
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:43,831
You buy my presents in cash.
I'm not stupid, Nick.

775
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:46,750
I know, sweetie. Did you leave a
pair of red panties in my office?

776
00:43:46,917 --> 00:43:50,212
I don't know. Maybe.
They better be mine.

777
00:43:50,379 --> 00:43:51,379
Sweetheart, think.

778
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,715
I don't know. I'd have to check
my red panty inventory.

779
00:43:53,882 --> 00:43:56,385
Andie, I need you
to take this seriously, okay?

780
00:43:56,552 --> 00:43:58,220
This is the last time
we're gonna see each other, until...

781
00:43:58,387 --> 00:43:59,847
Until when?

782
00:44:00,389 --> 00:44:01,723
Until it's safe.

783
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:03,350
You were going to get a divorce.

784
00:44:03,517 --> 00:44:05,561
Never say that out loud again.

785
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:08,397
Okay. I'm sorry.

786
00:44:09,273 --> 00:44:10,273
I don't wanna fight.

787
00:44:12,276 --> 00:44:13,735
I just wanna be with you.

788
00:44:13,902 --> 00:44:15,070
Andie, please...

789
00:44:15,904 --> 00:44:17,573
That's all I want.

790
00:44:18,907 --> 00:44:19,992
I can't.

791
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:24,454
It's our last time together.

792
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:26,665
Let's make the most of it.

793
00:44:33,422 --> 00:44:36,758
Real quick, but then you have to go.

794
00:44:39,595 --> 00:44:42,264
My husband has come undone.

795
00:44:42,431 --> 00:44:45,267
We moved to Missouri to save Maureen...

796
00:44:45,434 --> 00:44:48,145
but as it turns out, we couldn't.

797
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,192
It means a lot that you came.

798
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:55,719
We took a hit on the brownstone...

799
00:44:55,777 --> 00:44:58,113
and I used the last of my trust fund
to buy him a bar.

800
00:44:58,864 --> 00:45:01,116
So far, it's just costing money.

801
00:45:05,329 --> 00:45:09,124
Nick uses me for sex when he wants.

802
00:45:12,294 --> 00:45:14,796
Othen/vise, I don't exist.

803
00:45:16,048 --> 00:45:18,008
We should go to Outback tonight.

804
00:45:18,175 --> 00:45:19,301
That would be nice.

805
00:45:19,468 --> 00:45:22,554
Last night, I went from desperate
to pathetic.

806
00:45:23,472 --> 00:45:26,516
I became someone I don't even like.

807
00:45:26,683 --> 00:45:28,477
The kind of woman I used to mock.

808
00:45:28,894 --> 00:45:30,479
You're out so much.

809
00:45:30,646 --> 00:45:32,856
- I know.
- Stay home.

810
00:45:33,023 --> 00:45:35,234
- I can't, I'm already late.
- Then, can I come?

811
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,069
You would hate it.

812
00:45:37,236 --> 00:45:40,489
It's a bunch
of my dorky high school friends.

813
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:44,368
Do our code. No bullshit.

814
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:47,204
I thought
we weren't gonna be that couple.

815
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,545
Okay, bye.

816
00:45:57,214 --> 00:46:00,050
- Hey, I've been thinking.
- Yeah?

817
00:46:00,217 --> 00:46:01,593
Something positive.

818
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:04,054
Maybe it's time.

819
00:46:05,347 --> 00:46:07,057
Now is literally the worst time.

820
00:46:07,224 --> 00:46:08,464
It would be a new start for us.

821
00:46:08,684 --> 00:46:11,270
And for me,
I would have a real purpose here.

822
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:12,521
A child is not a hobby.

823
00:46:12,688 --> 00:46:13,689
Not a hobby.

824
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:15,899
An inspiration.

825
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:19,444
We could have had this fight
four hours ago. I'm late.

826
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:20,737
I didn't know it was gonna be a fight.

827
00:46:20,904 --> 00:46:24,199
You really wanna be the couple
that has a baby to save their marriage?

828
00:46:24,366 --> 00:46:25,367
"Save"?

829
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:27,911
Reboot, retool, rekindle, whatever!

830
00:46:28,078 --> 00:46:30,122
- And you're gonna walk out the door now?
- Yeah!

831
00:46:30,289 --> 00:46:32,708
You're a fucking coward.

832
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:34,626
No, it can't go on like this.

833
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:35,793
Really?

834
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:37,254
- I won't.
- You won't?

835
00:46:37,421 --> 00:46:39,631
You won't?
Why, it's not good enough for you?

836
00:46:39,798 --> 00:46:40,590
It's not even close!

837
00:46:40,757 --> 00:46:42,884
You stupid bitch!

838
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:46,305
<i>What scared me
wasn't that he'd pushed me.</i>

839
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:50,309
<i>What scared me was how much
he wanted to hurt me more.</i>

840
00:46:50,642 --> 00:46:52,728
What scared me
was that I'd finally realized...

841
00:46:53,729 --> 00:46:57,399
I am frightened of my own husband.

842
00:47:09,286 --> 00:47:10,662
You want me to call for backup?

843
00:47:10,829 --> 00:47:12,914
Nah, I'll protect you.

844
00:47:20,672 --> 00:47:22,090
Jesus.

845
00:47:27,137 --> 00:47:29,806
They ought to burn this place down.

846
00:47:30,265 --> 00:47:31,933
Seems like folks are trying.

847
00:47:37,439 --> 00:47:39,608
You really think this is anything?

848
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,943
Cross it off the list.

849
00:47:53,038 --> 00:47:54,623
Hey, Jason.

850
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:56,208
What's up, Rhonda?

851
00:47:56,375 --> 00:47:58,627
"... and dedicated to the proposition
that all men... "

852
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:02,214
- Have you seen this girl around here?
- Why do you ask?

853
00:48:02,464 --> 00:48:04,299
She was reported missing.

854
00:48:07,469 --> 00:48:09,221
"... and so dedicated, can long endure. "

855
00:48:09,388 --> 00:48:11,181
Yeah. I remember her.

856
00:48:11,348 --> 00:48:13,475
What did she want?
Weed, pills?

857
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:16,144
She wanted a gun.

858
00:48:16,395 --> 00:48:18,313
I told her it's not my thing.

859
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,358
I felt bad, though.
She seemed really desperate.

860
00:48:21,525 --> 00:48:24,986
She said it needed to be small,
so she could keep it close.

861
00:48:25,153 --> 00:48:26,863
Are you sure this is her?

862
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:29,157
You don't forget a girl like that
in here.

863
00:48:30,158 --> 00:48:31,535
She was all in pink.

864
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:34,246
It was Valentine's Day.

865
00:48:37,207 --> 00:48:39,835
For Valentine's Day,
I thought I'd buy a gun.

866
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:42,587
That is how crazy I've become.

867
00:48:43,672 --> 00:48:47,676
Nick wants me gone
but he won't ask for a divorce.

868
00:48:47,843 --> 00:48:51,847
In his mind, I'm the owner of his bar,
his only line of credit.

869
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:53,515
The bitch with the prenup.

870
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:57,561
I could go home to my parents...

871
00:48:57,727 --> 00:49:00,021
but I'd have to tell them the truth.

872
00:49:00,188 --> 00:49:03,900
And I don't even know
if I believe the truth.

873
00:49:04,067 --> 00:49:06,862
<i>Can I really think Nick would hurt me?</i>

874
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:09,865
I'm being paranoid. Crazy.

875
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:12,199
It's just...

876
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,704
I'd sleep better with a gun.

877
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:27,883
Oh, shit.

878
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:31,678
Wake up, baby.
My sister's gonna come out here.

879
00:49:36,057 --> 00:49:38,268
- Sorry to rush you.
- It's okay.

880
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:41,563
- Here. Let me help you.
- Okay.

881
00:49:41,771 --> 00:49:43,857
Just get that.

882
00:49:46,526 --> 00:49:48,028
Be very careful.

883
00:49:48,862 --> 00:49:49,862
I'm all right.

884
00:49:49,905 --> 00:49:52,365
Here you go.

885
00:49:52,532 --> 00:49:54,284
Promise me we'll talk every day.

886
00:49:54,451 --> 00:49:55,577
Okay, we will.

887
00:49:55,744 --> 00:49:58,455
Every day, Nick, or I'll go crazy.

888
00:49:59,247 --> 00:50:00,247
Don't go crazy.

889
00:50:00,373 --> 00:50:01,625
Okay.

890
00:50:06,046 --> 00:50:09,257
You fucking idiot.

891
00:50:09,424 --> 00:50:13,261
You fucking asshole!
You fucking lied to my fucking face!

892
00:50:14,763 --> 00:50:16,306
I'm sorry.

893
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:19,099
How old is she?

894
00:50:19,434 --> 00:50:20,644
She's in her early 20s.

895
00:50:21,561 --> 00:50:22,561
How long?

896
00:50:23,104 --> 00:50:25,774
- A year and a half.
- You lied to me for over a year?

897
00:50:25,941 --> 00:50:27,621
If I told you,
you would have made me stop.

898
00:50:27,651 --> 00:50:29,110
It's so fucking small.

899
00:50:29,277 --> 00:50:32,113
You're a liar and a cheat!
You're just like Dad!

900
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,448
How did you even meet her?

901
00:50:33,615 --> 00:50:34,824
She's one of my students.

902
00:50:36,076 --> 00:50:37,619
I thought writers hated clichés.

903
00:50:37,786 --> 00:50:38,495
I'm not a writer.

904
00:50:38,662 --> 00:50:40,862
"Boo-hoo, I got laid off.
I guess I'll fuck a teenager. "

905
00:50:40,956 --> 00:50:43,625
It wasn't like that, okay? You have
no idea how shitty it was with Amy...

906
00:50:43,792 --> 00:50:45,585
how fucking terrible she made me feel.

907
00:50:45,752 --> 00:50:48,797
Flyover Boy.
I would get knots in my stomach...

908
00:50:48,964 --> 00:50:50,674
just coming home,
knowing she would be sitting there...

909
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,000
dissatisfied, before I even
walked in the fucking door.

910
00:50:53,009 --> 00:50:54,302
This is so bad.

911
00:50:54,469 --> 00:50:56,429
If anybody finds out,
you're totally fucked.

912
00:50:56,596 --> 00:50:59,099
Boney found a pair of panties
in my office...

913
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:00,809
where, occasionally, Andie and I...

914
00:51:01,268 --> 00:51:02,269
I don't know what the fuck it means.

915
00:51:02,435 --> 00:51:03,478
Are they Super-Twat's?

916
00:51:03,645 --> 00:51:05,605
Her name is Andie.

917
00:51:05,772 --> 00:51:07,148
She's not entirely sure.

918
00:51:07,315 --> 00:51:08,875
So we are dealing with a 20-year-old...

919
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:10,318
who isn't sure
where she leaves her undies?

920
00:51:10,485 --> 00:51:12,685
If they're not Andie's,
that means that they're Amy's...

921
00:51:12,779 --> 00:51:14,364
and she left them there for me to find.

922
00:51:14,531 --> 00:51:18,159
Nick, I was scared for you before,
and now, I'm fucking petrified.

923
00:51:18,326 --> 00:51:20,495
We're having a vigil tonight
for your missing wife...

924
00:51:20,662 --> 00:51:23,665
and this morning, you're kissing
your college girlfriend goodbye!

925
00:51:23,832 --> 00:51:25,000
Can you imagine?

926
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:28,837
Have you watched television lately?

927
00:51:29,004 --> 00:51:32,007
Cable news is all over your shit.

928
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:34,342
I mean, what is wrong with this barkeep?

929
00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:36,678
His wife's nowhere to be found...

930
00:51:36,845 --> 00:51:40,390
and here's Nick Dunne for you, flirting.
Cute pic, huh?

931
00:51:40,557 --> 00:51:42,892
- Who is that?
- Some fucking tragedy groupie.

932
00:51:43,059 --> 00:51:44,853
- Who the fuck is that?
- I don't know.

933
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,021
She was trying to give me a casserole.

934
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:49,190
On the show today
we have defense attorney, Tanner Bolt...

935
00:51:49,357 --> 00:51:51,901
patron saint to wife-killers everywhere.

936
00:51:52,193 --> 00:51:55,572
Tanner Bolt, would you actually consider
defending Nick Dunne?

937
00:51:55,739 --> 00:51:56,740
Well, let me just say...

938
00:51:56,906 --> 00:51:59,534
as always, Ellen,
thank you for such a warm welcome.

939
00:51:59,701 --> 00:52:01,244
But of course, I'd defend Nick Dunne.

940
00:52:01,536 --> 00:52:03,936
Listen, just because this guy
isn't walking around weeping...

941
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,373
that doesn't mean that he's not hurting.

942
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:08,752
Tanner, the hallmark of a sociopath
is a lack of empathy.

943
00:52:08,918 --> 00:52:10,879
But the truth is,
you'd have to be a sociopath...

944
00:52:11,379 --> 00:52:13,048
to behave normally in this situation...

945
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:15,842
because it's the most
abnormal situation in the world.

946
00:52:16,009 --> 00:52:18,553
Tanner, are you trying to tell me
that this photo...

947
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,847
is remotely in the realm
of acceptable behavior?

948
00:52:21,014 --> 00:52:23,683
I'm so sick
of being picked apart by women.

949
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:26,936
You need to hire Tanner Bolt.

950
00:52:29,022 --> 00:52:29,689
I don't deserve this.

951
00:52:29,856 --> 00:52:31,608
Innocent until proven guilty.

952
00:52:31,775 --> 00:52:34,027
That's exactly what you deserve.

953
00:52:34,194 --> 00:52:35,737
Go home, Nick.

954
00:53:01,721 --> 00:53:03,139
Hey, buddy.

955
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,790
I can't believe
we haven't arrested this guy.

956
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:22,701
We're not gonna arrest anybody...

957
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:24,427
just because some blonde dunce says so.

958
00:53:24,786 --> 00:53:27,288
Why are you going so easy on him?
You got a crush?

959
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:30,792
One, I am conducting an investigation,
not a witch-hunt.

960
00:53:30,959 --> 00:53:32,752
And, two,
don't talk to me that way, ever.

961
00:53:32,919 --> 00:53:34,087
She was trying to buy a gun.

962
00:53:34,254 --> 00:53:36,297
We don't know who
or what was scaring her, Gil.

963
00:53:36,464 --> 00:53:37,464
Give me the update.

964
00:53:37,966 --> 00:53:40,468
No drug angles panned out yet,
so cross that off the list.

965
00:53:40,635 --> 00:53:42,595
I talked to the nurses
who care for Nick's father.

966
00:53:42,637 --> 00:53:45,223
The guy's a bastard, but he's weak as
a kitten, so cross that off the list.

967
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:46,433
- Hey.
- Hey.

968
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:49,894
So, luminol lit up the kitchen
like the 4th of July.

969
00:53:50,061 --> 00:53:51,229
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

970
00:53:51,396 --> 00:53:52,397
The blood is profuse.

971
00:53:52,564 --> 00:53:54,649
It is Amy's, type B,
and we should have DNA soon.

972
00:53:54,816 --> 00:53:55,816
Thoughts on a weapon?

973
00:53:55,942 --> 00:53:57,736
Trajectory indicates blunt force.

974
00:53:57,902 --> 00:54:00,238
Maybe a club or a two-by-four.

975
00:54:00,822 --> 00:54:03,950
She fell there,
but I doubt she got back up.

976
00:54:04,117 --> 00:54:05,410
Amy's medical records come in?

977
00:54:05,577 --> 00:54:07,579
No, we'll have them later tonight.

978
00:54:09,164 --> 00:54:10,582
My wife says he's a killer.

979
00:54:10,832 --> 00:54:13,168
Well, if Tiffany says...

980
00:54:38,777 --> 00:54:39,778
Hey.

981
00:54:40,111 --> 00:54:41,112
Hey.

982
00:54:45,533 --> 00:54:46,693
Thank you all for coming out.

983
00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:49,871
Hey Donnie, how are you?

984
00:54:50,038 --> 00:54:53,374
Rich, thank you so much.

985
00:55:00,673 --> 00:55:01,674
Hey.

986
00:55:08,723 --> 00:55:12,185
Thank you, folks.
Thank you for being here tonight.

987
00:55:12,352 --> 00:55:14,145
It just means the world to our family.

988
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:16,147
And to Amy.

989
00:55:16,731 --> 00:55:18,733
As you all know...

990
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:22,737
my wife, Amy Elliott Dunne...

991
00:55:22,904 --> 00:55:24,405
disappeared three days ago.

992
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:28,409
And I want to implore anyone
who has any information at all...

993
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:31,371
please come forward. Help us.

994
00:55:31,538 --> 00:55:32,330
So hot.

995
00:55:32,497 --> 00:55:33,748
He is so creepy.

996
00:55:33,915 --> 00:55:37,252
I wanna say something, because I think
some of you might be wondering...

997
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:39,337
and are too polite to ask.

998
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:42,924
I had nothing to do
with the disappearance of my wife.

999
00:55:43,508 --> 00:55:45,343
I'm cooperating with the police.

1000
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:47,428
I haven't hired a lawyer.

1001
00:55:47,595 --> 00:55:48,721
I have nothing to hide.

1002
00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:52,517
Amy is my soul mate.

1003
00:55:52,767 --> 00:55:54,060
She is brilliant...

1004
00:55:54,602 --> 00:55:57,689
she's charming, and wise.

1005
00:55:58,022 --> 00:55:59,732
I love you, Amy.

1006
00:56:03,862 --> 00:56:04,946
Asshole.

1007
00:56:06,281 --> 00:56:08,199
I love my wife...

1008
00:56:08,575 --> 00:56:09,784
so much.

1009
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:16,624
And I may not behave for the cameras
the way they want me to...

1010
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:20,128
and if they wanna punish me for that,
that's okay.

1011
00:56:20,295 --> 00:56:23,882
But I just wanna ask you in the media,
please, harass me...

1012
00:56:24,048 --> 00:56:26,968
but don't harass
the people of this town.

1013
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:29,053
If you need to mock somebody, mock me.

1014
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,305
Nick!

1015
00:56:30,471 --> 00:56:32,631
But please don't turn this investigation
into a circus.

1016
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,100
Where's your wife, Nick?

1017
00:56:34,267 --> 00:56:35,768
Let the police do theirjobs.

1018
00:56:36,227 --> 00:56:37,812
What did you do to your pregnant wife?

1019
00:56:39,647 --> 00:56:40,807
Did you tell them that, Nick?

1020
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,984
Did you tell them
Amy was six weeks pregnant?

1021
00:56:46,738 --> 00:56:48,907
Thank you for your support tonight.
Let's find Amy.

1022
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:52,715
Go ahead,
if you guys wanna say something.

1023
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:58,166
Gil, go, go.

1024
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:01,541
Nick, where are you going?

1025
00:57:01,669 --> 00:57:03,129
Stop him!

1026
00:57:03,296 --> 00:57:05,506
No questions right now. Thank you.

1027
00:57:08,009 --> 00:57:09,552
Why are you running away?

1028
00:57:10,637 --> 00:57:12,055
Don't run.

1029
00:57:13,139 --> 00:57:14,140
Everybody, stay back.

1030
00:57:18,937 --> 00:57:20,980
Guys, come on. You know better.

1031
00:57:21,147 --> 00:57:23,483
Get off the grass, get down to the curb.

1032
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:24,943
- Hey, Gil...
- On it.

1033
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:26,109
All right.

1034
00:57:26,194 --> 00:57:27,946
All right, y'all heard her. No pictures.

1035
00:57:28,029 --> 00:57:29,322
Hello?

1036
00:57:30,073 --> 00:57:31,491
Hello?

1037
00:57:31,658 --> 00:57:32,367
Fuck.

1038
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:33,910
You scared me. Want a drink?

1039
00:57:34,077 --> 00:57:35,453
Did you know she was pregnant?

1040
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,622
I told you,
Noelle Hawthorne is fucking crazy.

1041
00:57:37,789 --> 00:57:38,831
She doesn't even know Amy.

1042
00:57:39,499 --> 00:57:41,099
They look like pretty good friends
to me.

1043
00:57:48,675 --> 00:57:51,970
Look, I don't know. But it certainly
doesn't prove that she's pregnant.

1044
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:53,221
We have her medical records coming.

1045
00:57:53,388 --> 00:57:55,139
- Good.
- So, let's talk while we wait.

1046
00:57:55,306 --> 00:57:57,392
Let's start over here.
The scene of the crime.

1047
00:57:57,558 --> 00:58:00,311
You see, we've seen dozens
of home invasions.

1048
00:58:00,478 --> 00:58:02,313
Dozens and dozens.

1049
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,565
This area right here, it looked wrong
from the second we saw it.

1050
00:58:04,732 --> 00:58:07,902
The whole thing looked staged.
Watch this.

1051
00:58:09,821 --> 00:58:13,241
And yet, they remained upright
throughout this life-and-death struggle?

1052
00:58:13,658 --> 00:58:15,284
I don't know.
What do you want me to say?

1053
00:58:15,451 --> 00:58:16,953
Did you do any housekeeping
the day your wife went missing?

1054
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,120
No.

1055
00:58:18,121 --> 00:58:20,248
Because our guys did a luminol test.

1056
00:58:20,415 --> 00:58:22,959
And I'm sorry to tell you,
but that kitchen lit up.

1057
00:58:23,126 --> 00:58:25,253
Amy lost a lot of blood in there, Nick.
A lot.

1058
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:26,420
Oh, my God.

1059
00:58:26,421 --> 00:58:27,630
Yeah, and then somebody mopped it up.

1060
00:58:27,797 --> 00:58:30,133
Wait a second.
Why would they mop up the blood...

1061
00:58:30,299 --> 00:58:31,899
if they're trying to stage
a crime scene?

1062
00:58:31,926 --> 00:58:34,554
No blood and no body
suggests kidnapping.

1063
00:58:34,721 --> 00:58:37,015
It tells us,
look at people outside the house.

1064
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:38,474
Like these homeless you keep mentioning.

1065
00:58:38,641 --> 00:58:41,602
A pool of blood and no body
suggests homicide.

1066
00:58:41,769 --> 00:58:43,646
It tells us to look at people
inside the house.

1067
00:58:43,813 --> 00:58:46,399
- Which is what we're doing here, Nick.
- I see.

1068
00:58:46,566 --> 00:58:49,446
So, how was your marriage, Nick?
Because right now, all we got is Noelle.

1069
00:58:49,569 --> 00:58:50,987
She says, "Not good. "

1070
00:58:51,154 --> 00:58:52,530
Gil, what do you and your wife
argue about?

1071
00:58:52,697 --> 00:58:54,699
- What pisses you off?
- Money, lack thereof.

1072
00:58:54,866 --> 00:58:56,492
Me and my ex, it's the same.

1073
00:58:56,659 --> 00:58:59,871
I mention that because
we got a look at your finances, Nick.

1074
00:59:00,038 --> 00:59:02,623
$117,000 in credit card debt.

1075
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:04,625
- What?
- I pulled up some of the merchandise.

1076
00:59:04,792 --> 00:59:06,669
There are these fun little splurges.

1077
00:59:06,836 --> 00:59:08,254
I didn't buy any of this stuff.

1078
00:59:08,421 --> 00:59:09,422
I don't even golf!

1079
00:59:09,589 --> 00:59:10,798
I do! You bought great clubs.

1080
00:59:10,965 --> 00:59:12,133
I like the robot dog.

1081
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:14,135
This is identity theft!
This is a felony!

1082
00:59:14,302 --> 00:59:15,136
We need to find out who did this!

1083
00:59:15,303 --> 00:59:16,983
All right.
Let's talk about life insurance.

1084
00:59:17,096 --> 00:59:19,515
Because in April,
you bumped up Amy's life insurance...

1085
00:59:19,682 --> 00:59:20,682
to $1.2 million.

1086
00:59:20,725 --> 00:59:22,977
Yes, I did. That was her idea.
She wanted me to.

1087
00:59:23,144 --> 00:59:24,187
You filed the paperwork.

1088
00:59:24,353 --> 00:59:25,563
Because she told me to!

1089
00:59:26,397 --> 00:59:27,190
Hold on a sec.

1090
00:59:27,356 --> 00:59:29,150
Yeah? Okay.

1091
00:59:31,069 --> 00:59:32,236
For sure?

1092
00:59:32,653 --> 00:59:33,821
All right.

1093
00:59:37,909 --> 00:59:38,909
She was pregnant.

1094
00:59:42,997 --> 00:59:44,499
This is insane.

1095
00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:47,043
So, my question becomes...

1096
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:50,004
I don't want to talk
to you again, ever...

1097
00:59:50,171 --> 00:59:51,339
without a lawyer.

1098
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:00,681
Margo!

1099
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:12,568
Hey.

1100
01:00:14,946 --> 01:00:17,240
Just hold on a second. Let me finish.

1101
01:00:17,406 --> 01:00:18,199
Nick?

1102
01:00:18,366 --> 01:00:21,035
I hear you, I hear you.
I was as surprised as...

1103
01:00:21,202 --> 01:00:25,039
I know you're upset.
I had no idea she was pregnant.

1104
01:00:25,456 --> 01:00:28,584
Listen, I thought so, too,
but evidently that wasn't...

1105
01:00:31,087 --> 01:00:33,089
You want to know the truth?

1106
01:00:33,256 --> 01:00:35,633
The truth is, Amy didn't want kids.

1107
01:00:38,052 --> 01:00:40,096
Well, I'm as surprised as...

1108
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:43,224
You told me you didn't want kids.

1109
01:00:44,225 --> 01:00:45,625
I was trying to put a good face on.

1110
01:00:45,643 --> 01:00:47,395
Then, suddenly,
you've got a pregnant wife.

1111
01:00:47,562 --> 01:00:48,771
That's a problem for you.

1112
01:00:48,938 --> 01:00:51,899
Especially when you factor in
the secret teenage girlfriend.

1113
01:00:52,066 --> 01:00:53,401
Oh, stop watching Ellen Abbott!

1114
01:00:53,568 --> 01:00:54,902
You have to fucking talk to me!

1115
01:00:57,572 --> 01:01:01,492
I didn't tell you that she didn't want kids
because she didn't want me to.

1116
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:03,744
Because it would have just been
another reason for you to hate her.

1117
01:01:03,911 --> 01:01:05,663
And we had enough of those already!
It was easier to just...

1118
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:07,915
- Lie to me?
- I wanted kids!

1119
01:01:08,082 --> 01:01:10,242
When we first moved here,
I went to a fertility clinic!

1120
01:01:10,293 --> 01:01:11,836
- It didn't work?
- I did my part!

1121
01:01:12,003 --> 01:01:13,003
Masturbate.

1122
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,672
When it came time for Amy to do her thing,
all of a sudden it was like...

1123
01:01:14,839 --> 01:01:16,257
"Well, I don't know. Maybe. No, thanks. "

1124
01:01:16,424 --> 01:01:18,426
Now, who would believe you?

1125
01:01:19,594 --> 01:01:20,803
All right.

1126
01:01:30,438 --> 01:01:32,106
This is a letter from the clinic...

1127
01:01:32,273 --> 01:01:34,609
notifying me
that they're gonna destroy my sample...

1128
01:01:34,775 --> 01:01:36,777
unless I contact them.

1129
01:01:38,029 --> 01:01:39,447
So, I gave it to Amy.

1130
01:01:39,614 --> 01:01:42,491
The next day, I saw it in the trash.

1131
01:01:42,658 --> 01:01:44,118
But you were already with Andie
by then, right?

1132
01:01:44,285 --> 01:01:46,996
I wanted a baby with Amy.

1133
01:01:47,163 --> 01:01:51,334
A year ago, Amy being pregnant
would have been the best thing ever!

1134
01:01:57,882 --> 01:01:59,634
"When your poor Amy has a cold,
this dessertjust... "

1135
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,052
This is the clue you couldn't solve.

1136
01:02:01,219 --> 01:02:02,345
Yeah.

1137
01:02:04,055 --> 01:02:07,308
A letter from Desi.
That creepy boyfriend of Amy's?

1138
01:02:07,475 --> 01:02:09,756
It was the fucking rich guy
who would do anything for her.

1139
01:02:09,894 --> 01:02:11,729
It just kept hanging over my head.
It was disgusting.

1140
01:02:11,896 --> 01:02:12,896
Your prenup?

1141
01:02:13,231 --> 01:02:16,067
Nick, why have you kept this stuff?
It's like a little box of hate.

1142
01:02:16,234 --> 01:02:18,027
I don't know, Go! Maybe I hate her!

1143
01:02:20,905 --> 01:02:23,908
I love you no matter what.

1144
01:02:24,075 --> 01:02:25,326
But you need to tell me.

1145
01:02:25,493 --> 01:02:26,911
Tell you what?

1146
01:02:27,745 --> 01:02:29,372
What are you asking me?

1147
01:02:30,957 --> 01:02:34,126
Are you asking me
if I killed my wife, Go?

1148
01:02:34,585 --> 01:02:36,665
Is that what you're asking me?
If I murdered my wife?

1149
01:02:36,712 --> 01:02:39,131
I would never ask you that!

1150
01:02:43,094 --> 01:02:44,095
Margo!

1151
01:02:56,899 --> 01:02:59,110
Don't walk on the glass.

1152
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:03,447
You have no clue, do you?

1153
01:03:21,257 --> 01:03:22,842
Why was he here that night?

1154
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:27,179
His wife is missing. Why come here?

1155
01:03:27,346 --> 01:03:28,346
Who cares?

1156
01:03:28,556 --> 01:03:29,682
Rhonda, we got this.

1157
01:03:29,849 --> 01:03:31,225
Let's make the arrest.

1158
01:03:31,392 --> 01:03:33,352
Do you know how hard it is
to make a murder case without a body?

1159
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:34,353
No.

1160
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:36,522
Well, it's incredibly hard.

1161
01:03:36,689 --> 01:03:39,442
So, I want one last thing.

1162
01:03:39,608 --> 01:03:40,608
What's that?

1163
01:03:42,236 --> 01:03:44,530
I want a body.

1164
01:03:45,698 --> 01:03:49,994
Picture me.
I'm a girl who's very, very bad.

1165
01:03:50,161 --> 01:03:51,787
Be careful.

1166
01:03:56,334 --> 01:04:00,755
I need to be punished,
and by "punished," I mean "had. "

1167
01:04:05,301 --> 01:04:06,302
Fuck.

1168
01:04:08,262 --> 01:04:11,098
It's where you keep goodies
for anniversary five.

1169
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:14,393
So, open the door...

1170
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,811
Punish. Wood. Beach.

1171
01:04:15,978 --> 01:04:18,481
And look alive.

1172
01:04:21,609 --> 01:04:24,195
Punish. Wood.

1173
01:04:25,363 --> 01:04:26,947
Wood.

1174
01:04:59,063 --> 01:05:01,649
I will practice believing
my husband loves me...

1175
01:05:01,816 --> 01:05:04,235
and will love this baby.

1176
01:05:04,902 --> 01:05:08,531
That this child
might really save our marriage.

1177
01:05:09,407 --> 01:05:10,866
But I could be wrong.

1178
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:18,958
Because sometimes...

1179
01:05:19,959 --> 01:05:22,169
the way he looks at me...

1180
01:05:23,254 --> 01:05:24,880
I think...

1181
01:05:25,047 --> 01:05:26,132
man of my dreams...

1182
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:30,136
father of my child...

1183
01:05:30,928 --> 01:05:34,932
this man of mine may kill me.

1184
01:05:36,308 --> 01:05:38,310
He may truly...

1185
01:05:39,228 --> 01:05:40,228
kill me.

1186
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:43,940
WTF?

1187
01:06:08,883 --> 01:06:11,469
I am so much happier now that I'm dead.

1188
01:06:16,515 --> 01:06:18,100
Technically, "missing. "

1189
01:06:18,934 --> 01:06:20,603
Soon to be presumed dead.

1190
01:06:22,313 --> 01:06:23,439
Gone.

1191
01:06:24,398 --> 01:06:27,526
And my lazy, lying, cheating,
oblivious husband...

1192
01:06:27,693 --> 01:06:30,988
will go to prison for my murder.

1193
01:06:32,281 --> 01:06:34,700
Nick Dunne took my pride
and my dignity...

1194
01:06:34,867 --> 01:06:37,244
and my hope and my money.

1195
01:06:37,411 --> 01:06:40,873
He took and took from me
until I no longer existed.

1196
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,333
That's murder.

1197
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:45,294
Let the punishment fit the crime.

1198
01:06:45,878 --> 01:06:48,881
To fake a convincing murder,
you have to have discipline.

1199
01:06:53,093 --> 01:06:56,096
You befriend a local idiot.

1200
01:06:59,642 --> 01:07:02,811
Harvest the details
of her humdrum life.

1201
01:07:03,187 --> 01:07:06,774
And cram her with stories
about your husband's violent temper.

1202
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:10,194
Secretly create some money troubles.

1203
01:07:10,444 --> 01:07:13,614
Credit cards, perhaps online gambling.

1204
01:07:16,242 --> 01:07:18,327
With the help of the unwitting...

1205
01:07:18,494 --> 01:07:20,496
bump up your life insurance.

1206
01:07:22,206 --> 01:07:25,251
Purchase getaway car. Craigslist.

1207
01:07:25,417 --> 01:07:28,712
Generic. Cheap. Pay cash.

1208
01:07:29,171 --> 01:07:33,676
You need to package yourself so that
people will truly mourn your loss.

1209
01:07:33,842 --> 01:07:36,804
And America loves pregnant women.

1210
01:07:37,137 --> 01:07:40,015
As if it's so hard to spread your legs.

1211
01:07:40,182 --> 01:07:41,475
You know what's hard?

1212
01:07:41,976 --> 01:07:43,811
Faking a pregnancy.

1213
01:07:43,978 --> 01:07:46,146
First, drain your toilet.

1214
01:07:47,856 --> 01:07:50,484
Invite pregnant idiot into your home...

1215
01:07:50,651 --> 01:07:53,153
and ply her with lemonade.

1216
01:07:58,325 --> 01:08:00,494
Steal pregnant Idiot's urine.

1217
01:08:02,705 --> 01:08:04,081
<i>Voila'.</i>

1218
01:08:04,248 --> 01:08:08,210
A pregnancy is now pan'
of your legal medical record.

1219
01:08:14,717 --> 01:08:16,051
Happy anniversary.

1220
01:08:18,721 --> 01:08:21,348
Wait for your clueless husband...

1221
01:08:21,515 --> 01:08:23,392
to start his day.

1222
01:08:24,852 --> 01:08:26,186
Off he goes.

1223
01:08:26,353 --> 01:08:28,522
And the clock is ticking.

1224
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:32,192
Meticulously stage your crime scene...

1225
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:36,864
with just enough mistakes
to raise the specter of doubt.

1226
01:08:38,282 --> 01:08:40,242
You need to bleed.

1227
01:08:40,576 --> 01:08:41,576
A lot.

1228
01:08:42,202 --> 01:08:43,871
A lot, a lot.

1229
01:08:47,207 --> 01:08:49,043
A head wound kind of bleed.

1230
01:08:49,710 --> 01:08:52,212
A crime scene kind of bleed.

1231
01:08:55,215 --> 01:08:57,217
You need to clean poorly...

1232
01:08:57,384 --> 01:08:58,384
like he would.

1233
01:08:59,094 --> 01:09:01,597
Clean and bleed. Bleed and clean.

1234
01:09:02,222 --> 01:09:04,808
And leave a little something behind.

1235
01:09:05,476 --> 01:09:07,227
A fire in July?

1236
01:09:08,771 --> 01:09:09,771
And because you're you...

1237
01:09:09,897 --> 01:09:11,148
you don't stop there.

1238
01:09:11,565 --> 01:09:13,651
You need a diary.

1239
01:09:13,817 --> 01:09:16,737
Minimum, 300 entries
on the Nick and Amy story.

1240
01:09:17,404 --> 01:09:19,573
Stan' with the fairy tale early days.

1241
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:21,909
Those are true. And they're crucial.

1242
01:09:22,076 --> 01:09:24,078
<i>You want Nick and Amy to be likeable.</i>

1243
01:09:24,411 --> 01:09:26,914
After that, you invent.

1244
01:09:27,081 --> 01:09:28,081
The spending.

1245
01:09:28,082 --> 01:09:29,750
The abuse. The fear.

1246
01:09:29,917 --> 01:09:32,753
The threat of violence.

1247
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,880
And Nick thought he was the writer.

1248
01:09:35,589 --> 01:09:36,882
Burn it just the right amount.

1249
01:09:38,717 --> 01:09:40,594
Make sure the cops will find it.

1250
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:48,644
Finally, honor tradition
with a very special treasure hunt.

1251
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:53,982
And if I get everything right,
the world will hate Nick...

1252
01:09:54,066 --> 01:09:56,652
for killing his beautiful,
pregnant wife.

1253
01:09:56,819 --> 01:09:59,321
And after all the outrage,
when I'm ready...

1254
01:09:59,488 --> 01:10:01,488
I'll go out on the water
with a handful of pills...

1255
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:03,909
and a pocket full of stones.

1256
01:10:04,076 --> 01:10:06,745
And when they find my body,
they'll know...

1257
01:10:06,912 --> 01:10:10,082
Nick Dunne dumped his beloved
like garbage.

1258
01:10:10,249 --> 01:10:12,459
And she floated down
past all the other...

1259
01:10:12,626 --> 01:10:15,963
abused, unwanted, inconvenient women.

1260
01:10:17,339 --> 01:10:19,299
Then, Nick will die, too.

1261
01:10:20,175 --> 01:10:21,927
Nick and Amy will be gone.

1262
01:10:22,094 --> 01:10:24,096
But, then, we never really existed.

1263
01:10:24,263 --> 01:10:27,349
Nick loved a girl
I was pretending to be.

1264
01:10:27,516 --> 01:10:28,516
"Cool Girl. "

1265
01:10:28,976 --> 01:10:32,688
Men always use that
as their defining compliment.

1266
01:10:32,855 --> 01:10:33,855
"She's a cool girl. "

1267
01:10:34,982 --> 01:10:35,983
Cool Girl is hot.

1268
01:10:36,150 --> 01:10:37,443
Cool Girl is game.

1269
01:10:37,609 --> 01:10:38,609
Cool Girl is fun.

1270
01:10:38,944 --> 01:10:41,321
Cool Girl never gets angry at her man.

1271
01:10:41,488 --> 01:10:44,116
She only smiles in a chagrined,
loving manner...

1272
01:10:44,783 --> 01:10:47,619
and then presents her mouth for fucking.

1273
01:10:47,786 --> 01:10:49,663
She likes what he likes.

1274
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:53,292
So evidently, he's a vinyl hipster
who loves fetish manga.

1275
01:10:54,334 --> 01:10:57,504
If he likes Girls Gone Wild,
she's a mall babe...

1276
01:10:57,671 --> 01:11:01,341
who talks football
and endures buffalo wings at Hooters.

1277
01:11:01,508 --> 01:11:04,970
When I met Nick Dunne,
I knew he wanted Cool Girl.

1278
01:11:05,137 --> 01:11:07,681
And for him, I'll admit,
I was willing to try.

1279
01:11:07,848 --> 01:11:09,850
I wax-stripped my pussy raw.

1280
01:11:10,517 --> 01:11:13,645
I drank canned beer
watching Adam Sand/er movies.

1281
01:11:13,896 --> 01:11:16,523
I ate cold pizza
and remained a size two.

1282
01:11:16,732 --> 01:11:18,692
I blew him semi-regularly.

1283
01:11:20,027 --> 01:11:21,361
I lived in the moment.

1284
01:11:21,653 --> 01:11:24,198
I was fucking game.

1285
01:11:24,823 --> 01:11:26,867
I can't say I didn't enjoy some of it.

1286
01:11:27,701 --> 01:11:30,871
Nick teased out of me
things I didn't know existed.

1287
01:11:31,038 --> 01:11:34,208
A lightness, a humor, an ease.

1288
01:11:34,374 --> 01:11:37,169
But I made him smarter. Sharper.

1289
01:11:37,336 --> 01:11:40,839
I inspired him to rise to my level.

1290
01:11:41,006 --> 01:11:44,760
I forged the man of my dreams.

1291
01:11:47,095 --> 01:11:49,890
We were happy pretending
to be other people.

1292
01:11:50,057 --> 01:11:51,892
We were the happiest couple we knew.

1293
01:11:53,519 --> 01:11:56,522
And what's the point of being together
if you're not the happiest?

1294
01:11:57,189 --> 01:11:59,274
But Nick got lazy.

1295
01:11:59,441 --> 01:12:01,527
He became someone
I did not agree to marry.

1296
01:12:01,693 --> 01:12:04,863
He actually expected me
to love him unconditionally.

1297
01:12:05,531 --> 01:12:09,910
Then he dragged me, penniless,
to the navel of this great country...

1298
01:12:10,077 --> 01:12:13,914
and found himself a newer,
younger, bouncier...

1299
01:12:14,081 --> 01:12:15,082
Cool Girl.

1300
01:12:17,417 --> 01:12:21,588
You think I'd let him destroy me
and end up happier than ever?

1301
01:12:22,089 --> 01:12:23,757
No fucking wa y.

1302
01:12:24,132 --> 01:12:25,926
He doesn't get to win.

1303
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:40,232
My cute, charming, salt-of-the-earth,
Missouri guy.

1304
01:12:42,651 --> 01:12:45,112
He needed to learn.

1305
01:12:45,821 --> 01:12:48,448
Grown-ups work for things.

1306
01:12:48,991 --> 01:12:50,951
<i>Grown-ups pay.</i>

1307
01:12:52,327 --> 01:12:54,913
Grown-ups suffer consequences.

1308
01:12:58,417 --> 01:12:59,626
Wait.

1309
01:13:00,002 --> 01:13:02,671
I need 20 seconds where you
don'tjudge me, interrupt me...

1310
01:13:02,838 --> 01:13:04,464
or get angry.

1311
01:13:05,924 --> 01:13:07,467
Okay.

1312
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:13,265
Is that all the stuff
from the credit cards?

1313
01:13:13,432 --> 01:13:16,476
Where do you store goodies
for anniversary five?

1314
01:13:16,643 --> 01:13:17,311
Wood.

1315
01:13:17,477 --> 01:13:20,480
- Woodshed.
- Yeah, my woodshed.

1316
01:13:20,647 --> 01:13:23,150
That fucking bitch.

1317
01:13:24,985 --> 01:13:26,225
- I thought...
- It's all right.

1318
01:13:26,361 --> 01:13:27,821
I would have, too.

1319
01:13:31,283 --> 01:13:32,367
What's that present?

1320
01:13:32,534 --> 01:13:34,161
I don't know.

1321
01:13:34,328 --> 01:13:36,288
Let's find out.

1322
01:13:42,878 --> 01:13:46,673
"Dear Husband, I know you think
you're moving through this world unseen. "

1323
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,200
"Don't believe that for a second. "

1324
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:50,581
"L know where you've been,
and I know where you're going. "

1325
01:13:53,805 --> 01:13:55,724
"For this anniversary,
I've arranged a trip. "

1326
01:13:55,891 --> 01:13:57,643
"Follow the river, up, up, up. "

1327
01:13:57,809 --> 01:14:00,395
"Sit back and relax,
because you are done. "

1328
01:14:00,562 --> 01:14:01,855
What's "up, up river"?

1329
01:14:02,022 --> 01:14:04,024
"Up the river. " Prison.

1330
01:14:04,232 --> 01:14:06,026
Fucking crazy bitch.

1331
01:14:06,193 --> 01:14:07,694
That's what this is.

1332
01:14:07,861 --> 01:14:10,030
She's framing me for her murder.

1333
01:14:10,197 --> 01:14:11,365
You married a complete psychopath.

1334
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:13,492
The morning of our anniversary...

1335
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:17,871
I was gonna ask her for a divorce.
I just couldn't do it.

1336
01:14:18,038 --> 01:14:20,374
I couldn't fake it for another year,
another day.

1337
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:21,333
Then what happened?

1338
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:22,668
Before I could say anything, she said...

1339
01:14:22,834 --> 01:14:26,088
"I need you to go somewhere
and really think about our marriage. "

1340
01:14:26,254 --> 01:14:27,381
She knew I would go to Sawyer Beach.

1341
01:14:27,547 --> 01:14:28,715
So you'd have no alibi.

1342
01:14:28,882 --> 01:14:31,093
She stage-managed me.

1343
01:14:31,385 --> 01:14:34,930
She knew exactly what I would do.
And I fucking did it.

1344
01:14:35,097 --> 01:14:36,515
I went to the beach,
I thought about our marriage.

1345
01:14:36,682 --> 01:14:38,362
I came back
and decided I wanted a divorce.

1346
01:14:38,433 --> 01:14:39,673
And by the time you got home...

1347
01:14:39,685 --> 01:14:41,228
She was gone.

1348
01:14:41,853 --> 01:14:42,604
You fuck!

1349
01:14:42,771 --> 01:14:44,356
She's good.

1350
01:14:45,357 --> 01:14:47,234
Part of me was relieved...

1351
01:14:47,401 --> 01:14:49,695
when I thought she was gone.

1352
01:14:54,074 --> 01:14:55,784
Punch and Judy puppets.

1353
01:14:58,787 --> 01:15:01,748
Remember, he beats Judy to death
and kills that baby.

1354
01:15:01,915 --> 01:15:03,041
So I'm Punch.

1355
01:15:04,042 --> 01:15:06,044
We already knew that, Amy,
what's your point?

1356
01:15:07,212 --> 01:15:10,048
Does Missouri have the death penalty?

1357
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:38,368
Hey, neighbor.

1358
01:15:39,286 --> 01:15:41,663
It's been weeks
since I had anyone decent next door.

1359
01:15:42,289 --> 01:15:44,791
Well, I don't know how decent I feel.

1360
01:15:44,958 --> 01:15:47,961
As long as you don't own a python
and blast death metal at 4 AM...

1361
01:15:48,128 --> 01:15:50,005
we're gonna be best friends.

1362
01:15:50,172 --> 01:15:52,132
All right. Nice meeting you.

1363
01:15:52,299 --> 01:15:53,884
I'm Greta.

1364
01:15:54,509 --> 01:15:55,677
I'm Nancy.

1365
01:15:55,844 --> 01:15:57,679
Are you going to the marina?
I could use some creamer.

1366
01:15:57,846 --> 01:15:59,139
I'm sorry. I can't.

1367
01:15:59,306 --> 01:16:00,515
I've got work to do.

1368
01:16:00,807 --> 01:16:02,851
All right. See you around!

1369
01:16:03,143 --> 01:16:05,062
You Will.

1370
01:16:51,024 --> 01:16:56,238
Come on.
Show me that darling Nicky smile.

1371
01:16:58,031 --> 01:16:59,908
You asshole.

1372
01:17:15,382 --> 01:17:16,883
Hey.

1373
01:17:19,678 --> 01:17:21,429
Nancy.

1374
01:17:23,723 --> 01:17:25,559
Nancy.

1375
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,770
It's hot again today.

1376
01:17:31,064 --> 01:17:32,899
So, where are you from?

1377
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:34,568
Let me guess.

1378
01:17:37,696 --> 01:17:38,696
Nebraska.

1379
01:17:40,907 --> 01:17:42,117
New Orleans.

1380
01:17:45,579 --> 01:17:47,956
You know, I am an expert oiler.

1381
01:17:48,123 --> 01:17:49,791
Oh, I just bet you are.

1382
01:17:49,958 --> 01:17:52,586
Lotions and balms. Ointment.

1383
01:17:53,295 --> 01:17:55,088
I would hate
for y'all to get tan lines.

1384
01:17:55,255 --> 01:17:57,257
So sweet.

1385
01:17:58,091 --> 01:18:00,760
Okay. You know where I'll be.

1386
01:18:03,638 --> 01:18:06,057
I see we have the same taste in men.

1387
01:18:07,767 --> 01:18:09,895
I clipped it on a bathroom cabinet.

1388
01:18:10,061 --> 01:18:13,106
Least you could do
is not keep his secrets for him.

1389
01:18:14,149 --> 01:18:15,400
Let me guess.

1390
01:18:15,567 --> 01:18:19,446
He's trying to watch the big game
and you just won't shut up.

1391
01:18:19,738 --> 01:18:22,449
No, you don't seem
like much of a talker.

1392
01:18:22,616 --> 01:18:23,616
I got it.

1393
01:18:23,617 --> 01:18:25,952
You caught your boy rubbing up
on some hot little skank...

1394
01:18:26,119 --> 01:18:28,119
and he apologized to you
by busting you a good one.

1395
01:18:30,498 --> 01:18:31,498
Worse.

1396
01:18:31,625 --> 01:18:32,626
Worse?

1397
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:37,047
I went to the bar where he works
to surprise him.

1398
01:18:37,214 --> 01:18:41,927
And out he comes with this girl
who had no business being in a bar.

1399
01:18:44,888 --> 01:18:46,890
On the very first night that we met...

1400
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:51,311
we walked by a bakery
that was having their sugar delivered.

1401
01:18:52,145 --> 01:18:54,397
And it was in the air, everywhere.

1402
01:18:54,564 --> 01:18:56,733
A sugar storm.

1403
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:58,902
And before he kissed me...

1404
01:18:59,069 --> 01:19:01,154
he leaned in...

1405
01:19:02,656 --> 01:19:04,950
and did this.

1406
01:19:15,627 --> 01:19:17,963
- And guess what.
- What?

1407
01:19:18,129 --> 01:19:19,839
He did the exact same thing with her.

1408
01:19:24,094 --> 01:19:26,972
That is the most disgusting thing
I ever heard.

1409
01:19:27,138 --> 01:19:28,848
Thank you.

1410
01:19:43,613 --> 01:19:45,198
Thanks very much.

1411
01:19:51,997 --> 01:19:54,291
Well, we've gone mainstream.

1412
01:20:09,889 --> 01:20:12,892
It's an appeals process,
so we will attempt to appeal to them.

1413
01:20:13,059 --> 01:20:15,186
Mr. Bolt. Tanner Bolt?

1414
01:20:17,063 --> 01:20:18,356
Nick Dunne.

1415
01:20:18,523 --> 01:20:20,817
I have been sitting by the phone,
my friend.

1416
01:20:24,279 --> 01:20:25,405
I'm sorry.

1417
01:20:25,572 --> 01:20:27,282
Do you not believe me?

1418
01:20:27,449 --> 01:20:30,577
No, I believe you. It's just the
craziest thing I've ever heard.

1419
01:20:30,744 --> 01:20:34,080
I love it. But, for you, it sucks.

1420
01:20:34,789 --> 01:20:37,959
But you gotta have a grudging respect
for your wife at this point, right?

1421
01:20:38,126 --> 01:20:39,586
- Are you laughing me out of the building?
- No!

1422
01:20:39,753 --> 01:20:41,379
Are you kidding me? I'm in.

1423
01:20:41,546 --> 01:20:42,881
I'm way in.

1424
01:20:43,048 --> 01:20:45,550
You came to the right guy.
This is what I do, Nick.

1425
01:20:45,717 --> 01:20:49,012
This is why I have a $100,000 retainer.
I win the unwinnable cases.

1426
01:20:49,179 --> 01:20:50,722
$100,000?

1427
01:20:50,889 --> 01:20:52,307
We'll figure something out.

1428
01:20:52,474 --> 01:20:53,514
I'll give you a special...

1429
01:20:53,516 --> 01:20:56,311
"my wife is skilled
in the art of vengeance" rate.

1430
01:20:56,478 --> 01:20:57,478
Okay.

1431
01:20:57,562 --> 01:20:59,064
So, what's the plan?

1432
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:00,982
Well, right now,
it's a "he said, she said. "

1433
01:21:01,149 --> 01:21:03,485
- She's telling a better story.
- No, Nick.

1434
01:21:03,651 --> 01:21:05,487
She is telling the perfect story.

1435
01:21:05,779 --> 01:21:08,948
So, we need to start today
to prepare your defense, should we need it.

1436
01:21:09,115 --> 01:21:10,903
And if we decide to go
with your version of...

1437
01:21:10,915 --> 01:21:11,515
The truth.

1438
01:21:12,410 --> 01:21:15,622
Then we'll need to realign
the public's perception of Amy.

1439
01:21:15,789 --> 01:21:17,916
Make them stop seeing her
as America's sweetheart...

1440
01:21:18,083 --> 01:21:21,419
and see her for what she is,
which a mind-fucker of the first degree.

1441
01:21:21,836 --> 01:21:25,673
Now, that is a huge realignment.
We'll need other voices besides yours.

1442
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,967
There has to be someone out there
that she's screwed with in the past.

1443
01:21:28,134 --> 01:21:31,096
There's a New York guy.
O'Hara, Tommy O'Hara.

1444
01:21:31,262 --> 01:21:33,515
Eight years ago,
she pressed charges against him.

1445
01:21:33,681 --> 01:21:35,850
That should be easy to find.

1446
01:21:36,393 --> 01:21:39,646
Ex-classmate, Desi Collings.

1447
01:21:39,813 --> 01:21:41,693
She said that he stalked her.
He's in St. Louis.

1448
01:21:42,982 --> 01:21:45,235
You go talk to Tommy,
and I'll draw up the contract.

1449
01:21:49,531 --> 01:21:52,534
I told you, you came to the right guy.

1450
01:21:54,744 --> 01:21:55,954
Apparently.

1451
01:22:05,004 --> 01:22:06,673
Tommy?

1452
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:08,383
Yeah.

1453
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,760
- Thanks for seeing me.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1454
01:22:13,847 --> 01:22:15,557
You're gonna want a drink.

1455
01:22:16,099 --> 01:22:17,308
Yeah.

1456
01:22:17,475 --> 01:22:20,145
So, she said you got physical with her.

1457
01:22:20,311 --> 01:22:23,148
No, dude, she said I raped her.

1458
01:22:23,314 --> 01:22:25,692
First degree, felony rape.

1459
01:22:26,443 --> 01:22:28,153
- Did you do it?
- Did you do it?

1460
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:31,406
I was looking at 30 years to life.

1461
01:22:31,948 --> 01:22:33,366
- Did you get a trial?
- Fuck, no.

1462
01:22:33,533 --> 01:22:35,618
Do I look like
I would do well in the yard?

1463
01:22:35,785 --> 01:22:38,705
I pled down, man.
Sexual assault one, no jail time.

1464
01:22:39,122 --> 01:22:40,665
- That's something.
- Oh, yeah.

1465
01:22:40,832 --> 01:22:42,125
I've been unemployed
for the last eight years...

1466
01:22:42,292 --> 01:22:44,669
because I have to write "sexual offender"
on every job application.

1467
01:22:44,836 --> 01:22:47,796
I'm on a neighborhood watch list,
because I have to register as a predator.

1468
01:22:47,839 --> 01:22:51,176
I haven't had a date in almost a decade,
because if a girl googles me...

1469
01:22:53,136 --> 01:22:55,054
Could you walk me through what happened?

1470
01:22:55,346 --> 01:22:58,349
I meet Amy at this party, you know?

1471
01:22:58,516 --> 01:23:00,018
We click. She's perfect.

1472
01:23:00,185 --> 01:23:02,395
She's beautiful,
she's smart, she's well-read...

1473
01:23:02,562 --> 01:23:04,731
she's got an ass
like a 20-year-old stripper.

1474
01:23:04,898 --> 01:23:06,566
I think, "What's the catch?"

1475
01:23:06,733 --> 01:23:09,903
A few months, it hits me.
This is not going to be easy.

1476
01:23:10,570 --> 01:23:13,490
Girls like a fixer-upper, but Amy?

1477
01:23:13,656 --> 01:23:16,993
She annexed me.
She made me her business.

1478
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:20,830
It was just too much.
She went out and bought me ties.

1479
01:23:20,997 --> 01:23:23,082
And we must have gone
20 rounds over that.

1480
01:23:23,249 --> 01:23:25,877
Ties. The whole thing just became...

1481
01:23:26,044 --> 01:23:29,714
- So, you broke up with her.
- No, I just backed away.

1482
01:23:29,881 --> 01:23:32,550
Gave her some space. No big deal, right?

1483
01:23:32,717 --> 01:23:34,260
So I thought.

1484
01:23:34,427 --> 01:23:36,596
Then one night,
Amy comes over to my place...

1485
01:23:36,763 --> 01:23:39,557
with a bottle of bourbon
and a bootleg of this band I love.

1486
01:23:39,724 --> 01:23:42,602
And within two minutes,
she's got my pants around my ankles...

1487
01:23:42,769 --> 01:23:44,229
and she is kneeling down, and...

1488
01:23:44,395 --> 01:23:46,272
I'm sorry. I know it's your wife.

1489
01:23:46,439 --> 01:23:48,191
- You had sex?
- Yeah, consensual.

1490
01:23:48,358 --> 01:23:50,443
It was rough,
but she was screaming for it.

1491
01:23:50,902 --> 01:23:53,238
Next morning,
there's two cops at my door.

1492
01:23:53,571 --> 01:23:56,366
Amy has wounds
that are consistent with rape.

1493
01:23:56,533 --> 01:23:59,577
Ligature marks on her wrist,
and my semen.

1494
01:23:59,744 --> 01:24:03,289
It looks like I've tied Amy to my bed,
and raped her.

1495
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:04,791
Me!

1496
01:24:04,958 --> 01:24:06,584
And then, guess what they find.

1497
01:24:06,751 --> 01:24:08,795
Headboards of my bed, one on each side.

1498
01:24:09,212 --> 01:24:10,421
The ties you wouldn't wear.

1499
01:24:10,588 --> 01:24:11,923
You do know your wife.

1500
01:24:12,590 --> 01:24:14,300
- Did you ever see her again?
- Yeah.

1501
01:24:14,467 --> 01:24:15,885
On TV, last week, with you.

1502
01:24:16,469 --> 01:24:17,762
I thought, "There's Amy. "

1503
01:24:17,929 --> 01:24:21,933
"She's graduated from being raped
to being murdered. "

1504
01:24:25,770 --> 01:24:26,890
You been watching this, too?

1505
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:28,064
Last night's bombshell.

1506
01:24:28,231 --> 01:24:29,231
We just found out...

1507
01:24:29,315 --> 01:24:32,151
Amy Elliott Dunne was, indeed,
pregnant when she went missing.

1508
01:24:32,652 --> 01:24:35,488
Kelly Capitono,
this makes me wanna throw up.

1509
01:24:35,655 --> 01:24:38,491
What is it about a pregnant woman,
a woman carrying life inside her...

1510
01:24:38,658 --> 01:24:39,993
that turns men into animals?

1511
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:41,661
Ellen, this is an epidemic.

1512
01:24:41,953 --> 01:24:44,153
The third leading cause of death
among pregnant women...

1513
01:24:44,247 --> 01:24:46,499
is homicide committed by
a boyfriend or husband.

1514
01:24:46,666 --> 01:24:49,419
Let's not forget about the wife, ever.

1515
01:24:49,586 --> 01:24:53,506
Tonight, we welcome Amy's best friend,
Noelle Hawthorne.

1516
01:24:53,673 --> 01:24:55,925
Thanks for being on the show, Noelle.

1517
01:24:56,092 --> 01:24:57,260
Thank you, Ellen.

1518
01:24:57,427 --> 01:24:58,803
And let me just say this...

1519
01:24:58,970 --> 01:25:02,432
Amy would have loved you,
and all you do for women.

1520
01:25:02,599 --> 01:25:03,599
Oh, that's nice.

1521
01:25:03,683 --> 01:25:05,685
Why don't you tell us
about your friend, Noelle?

1522
01:25:05,852 --> 01:25:08,271
Amy was so nurturing.

1523
01:25:08,438 --> 01:25:10,690
Oh, I'd love ifjust once,
someone was like...

1524
01:25:10,857 --> 01:25:12,150
"She was a real rag. "

1525
01:25:14,652 --> 01:25:17,113
She was beautiful and smart and kind.

1526
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,198
Seems like a rich bitch to me.

1527
01:25:19,365 --> 01:25:21,868
What do you mean? People love her.

1528
01:25:22,035 --> 01:25:24,454
I don't know. She seems uppity.

1529
01:25:26,164 --> 01:25:28,541
Spoiled rich girl,
married a cheating asshole.

1530
01:25:28,708 --> 01:25:29,792
Paid the ultimate price.

1531
01:25:29,959 --> 01:25:33,296
The only secret was her husband.
We never met Nick.

1532
01:25:33,463 --> 01:25:34,964
He never introduced himself.

1533
01:25:35,131 --> 01:25:37,383
Why was that, Noelle? Why do you think?

1534
01:25:37,550 --> 01:25:38,551
I think we know why.

1535
01:25:39,344 --> 01:25:41,471
Because he had a violent temper.

1536
01:25:41,638 --> 01:25:42,638
A little harsh.

1537
01:25:42,722 --> 01:25:44,182
That's life, baby.

1538
01:25:44,349 --> 01:25:45,909
He knew I'd have
seen right through him.

1539
01:25:46,851 --> 01:25:48,061
Don't get me wrong.

1540
01:25:48,227 --> 01:25:49,979
I'm not saying it's okay he killed her.

1541
01:25:50,146 --> 01:25:53,566
I'm just saying, there are consequences.

1542
01:25:55,693 --> 01:25:56,693
Fuck, yeah.

1543
01:25:56,736 --> 01:25:59,030
She was so alone.

1544
01:25:59,197 --> 01:26:00,990
And she was so innocent.

1545
01:26:01,157 --> 01:26:04,494
You're a good friend, Noelle.
And you're a good friend of the show.

1546
01:26:04,661 --> 01:26:05,745
Thanks for coming on.

1547
01:26:05,912 --> 01:26:07,246
Please tell me you landed Tanner Bolt.

1548
01:26:07,413 --> 01:26:09,582
Tanner Bolt landed me.

1549
01:26:09,749 --> 01:26:12,919
I'm gonna try and see Desi Collings
on my way home.

1550
01:26:13,086 --> 01:26:14,921
And, Go...

1551
01:26:15,088 --> 01:26:18,257
Tanner's retainer is $100,000.

1552
01:26:18,716 --> 01:26:20,176
That's just the retainer.

1553
01:26:20,551 --> 01:26:24,055
Listen, I've got $47,000 in savings.
I've got $2,500 in an IRA.

1554
01:26:24,222 --> 01:26:27,183
I'm approved for a second mortgage
on the house. We will go from there.

1555
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:29,102
Thank you.

1556
01:26:29,852 --> 01:26:31,396
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

1557
01:26:31,562 --> 01:26:34,190
Nick keeps his father,
who has Alzheimer's, in a facility.

1558
01:26:34,357 --> 01:26:36,442
Number of times he visited last year?
One.

1559
01:26:36,609 --> 01:26:37,609
Oh, fuck!

1560
01:26:37,610 --> 01:26:40,196
His twin sister, Margo,
well, she is a peach.

1561
01:26:40,363 --> 01:26:42,699
These two spend their days
in the bar Amy bought them.

1562
01:26:43,282 --> 01:26:45,284
Playing what, Lauren? Playing house?

1563
01:26:45,451 --> 01:26:46,452
What the fuck?

1564
01:26:46,619 --> 01:26:49,288
Twin siblings often enable and abet.

1565
01:26:49,789 --> 01:26:51,624
While I never examined Nick,
or his sister...

1566
01:26:52,417 --> 01:26:54,544
they both seem very, very close.

1567
01:26:54,877 --> 01:26:56,129
It's twin-cest.

1568
01:26:56,462 --> 01:26:59,048
Disturbingly close, Lauren.

1569
01:26:59,215 --> 01:27:01,092
And so, we close with a question.

1570
01:27:01,259 --> 01:27:02,635
What kind of moral rot...

1571
01:27:02,802 --> 01:27:07,390
allows a beautiful, talented,
kind, smart, loving mother...

1572
01:27:07,557 --> 01:27:11,144
to vanish without
the heavens hearing our outraged cries?

1573
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:12,310
Can I bum a cigarette?

1574
01:27:12,395 --> 01:27:16,149
Amy Elliott Dunne, we care about you,
and we will not forget.

1575
01:27:16,649 --> 01:27:18,735
And you know what else we won't forget?

1576
01:27:18,901 --> 01:27:21,154
Missouri has the death penalty.

1577
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:22,488
Amen.

1578
01:27:48,347 --> 01:27:50,516
I'd like to report
some strange activity...

1579
01:27:50,683 --> 01:27:54,187
near the woodshed
on the property of one Margo Dunne.

1580
01:28:35,394 --> 01:28:36,854
Hey.

1581
01:28:42,401 --> 01:28:44,529
- Mr. Dunne.
- Mr. Collings.

1582
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:48,491
I know you.
I saw you at the volunteer center.

1583
01:28:48,658 --> 01:28:50,368
I wanted to help.

1584
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:52,745
I hope you don't mind me coming by.

1585
01:28:52,912 --> 01:28:55,998
I got your address from this letter
that you wrote my wife.

1586
01:28:56,874 --> 01:29:00,253
Amy and I believe
in the lost art of letter-writing.

1587
01:29:00,419 --> 01:29:04,257
I always wondered
why you kept in touch after...

1588
01:29:04,924 --> 01:29:06,092
everything.

1589
01:29:06,259 --> 01:29:08,553
You were together for two years
in boarding school, right?

1590
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:10,763
She was my first serious girlfriend.

1591
01:29:10,930 --> 01:29:13,599
- Why did you break up?
- That's a strange question.

1592
01:29:13,766 --> 01:29:15,601
Did you treat her bad?
Did you cheat on her?

1593
01:29:15,768 --> 01:29:16,853
That's a rude question.

1594
01:29:17,019 --> 01:29:18,604
Let me tell you what Amy told me.

1595
01:29:18,771 --> 01:29:21,607
She dumped you,
you completely unraveled.

1596
01:29:21,774 --> 01:29:23,734
You stalked her, you threatened her...

1597
01:29:23,901 --> 01:29:27,280
and you attempted suicide in her bed
and were institutionalized.

1598
01:29:27,446 --> 01:29:31,242
Your wife is missing,
and you came all this way to tell me this?

1599
01:29:31,409 --> 01:29:33,619
I thought there might be
another side to this story.

1600
01:29:37,290 --> 01:29:39,125
Mr. Collings.

1601
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:43,129
Fuck.

1602
01:29:48,759 --> 01:29:51,637
The missing persons case
of Amy Elliott Dunne.

1603
01:29:51,804 --> 01:29:55,474
She is the beautiful blonde inspiration
for the Amazing Amy kids' book series.

1604
01:30:12,658 --> 01:30:14,744
You're reading that diary again?

1605
01:30:14,911 --> 01:30:15,911
You know how it ends.

1606
01:30:15,995 --> 01:30:18,331
It interests me.

1607
01:30:18,497 --> 01:30:19,957
Hey, Rhonda.

1608
01:30:20,124 --> 01:30:21,918
"He's gonna kill me. " The end.

1609
01:30:22,084 --> 01:30:24,086
Why did he go to his dad's house
to burn it?

1610
01:30:24,253 --> 01:30:25,254
It's private. There's no one there.

1611
01:30:25,421 --> 01:30:28,090
Why didn't he make sure
it actually burned?

1612
01:30:28,257 --> 01:30:31,093
Because he tripped the alarm.
You were up his ass with a flashlight.

1613
01:30:31,260 --> 01:30:33,471
The whole thing just feels hinky.

1614
01:30:33,638 --> 01:30:35,598
Like finding an envelope marked "Clue. "

1615
01:30:35,765 --> 01:30:36,766
You ever hear the expression...

1616
01:30:36,933 --> 01:30:38,773
"The simplest answer
is often the correct one"?

1617
01:30:39,477 --> 01:30:41,354
Actually, I've never
found that to be true.

1618
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,314
- Good night.
- Good night.

1619
01:30:45,983 --> 01:30:46,984
Hey.

1620
01:30:56,452 --> 01:30:58,204
Elvis is in Missouri.

1621
01:30:58,371 --> 01:31:00,373
Thank God. Come on in.

1622
01:31:00,539 --> 01:31:03,419
First thing you have to understand
about Amy, she loves to teach lessons.

1623
01:31:03,542 --> 01:31:05,878
- Play God.
- Yeah, Old Testament God.

1624
01:31:06,045 --> 01:31:07,045
Okay. Keep talking.

1625
01:31:07,129 --> 01:31:08,714
She finds out I've been cheating on her
with Andie...

1626
01:31:08,881 --> 01:31:10,341
decides to teach me a lesson.

1627
01:31:10,508 --> 01:31:12,301
Fakes her own death, frames me for it.

1628
01:31:12,468 --> 01:31:14,553
Blood in the house, credit cards,
life insurance.

1629
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:15,805
She does the treasure hunt.

1630
01:31:15,972 --> 01:31:17,181
Now, the treasure hunt is critical.

1631
01:31:17,348 --> 01:31:20,893
She's taking us on a tour of my
infidelities. Rubbing my nose in it.

1632
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:22,979
And she leaves clue number one
for the police...

1633
01:31:23,145 --> 01:31:24,745
which will lead them
back to my office...

1634
01:31:24,897 --> 01:31:27,316
which is a place
where Andie and I would often...

1635
01:31:27,483 --> 01:31:28,693
And she leaves a pair of red panties.

1636
01:31:28,859 --> 01:31:29,902
Right. Racy, looks bad.

1637
01:31:30,069 --> 01:31:31,654
- Clue two.
- My father's house.

1638
01:31:31,821 --> 01:31:34,073
Another place where Andie and I
would occasionally have relations.

1639
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:35,491
- Clue three?
- Woodshed.

1640
01:31:35,658 --> 01:31:37,034
- Also a location...
- Oh, my God.

1641
01:31:37,201 --> 01:31:38,828
- We had limited options.
- A hotel.

1642
01:31:38,995 --> 01:31:41,372
- Amy would have seen the credit card bill.
- Put it on Andie's credit card.

1643
01:31:41,539 --> 01:31:42,748
Andie's statement
went right to her parents.

1644
01:31:42,915 --> 01:31:45,334
Nick, Margo, can we head over
to the little brown house?

1645
01:31:45,501 --> 01:31:47,169
- This leads us to what?
- My dad's house.

1646
01:31:47,336 --> 01:31:49,088
Dad's house is blue.

1647
01:31:50,381 --> 01:31:53,426
After the divorce,
when Dad wasn't coming around...

1648
01:31:53,759 --> 01:31:57,888
I used to pretend that he was a spy
named Mr. Brown, who...

1649
01:31:58,055 --> 01:32:01,600
for the sake of his children's safety,
had to deny their existence.

1650
01:32:01,767 --> 01:32:03,185
You never told me that.

1651
01:32:03,436 --> 01:32:05,104
You told her that?

1652
01:32:05,271 --> 01:32:07,565
We've got incriminating red panties
in your office.

1653
01:32:07,898 --> 01:32:10,298
We've got a Showcase Showdown
worth of crap in your woodshed.

1654
01:32:11,402 --> 01:32:14,613
So, what in God's name
is at your father's house, Nick?

1655
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:15,780
And be honest.

1656
01:32:15,906 --> 01:32:17,742
I honestly have no idea.

1657
01:32:24,915 --> 01:32:28,627
Whatever they found, I think it's
safe to assume that it's very bad.

1658
01:32:30,463 --> 01:32:32,715
We got a lot of uncontained issues here.

1659
01:32:32,965 --> 01:32:36,052
Nick, do you have any idea
as to what Andie's mindset is?

1660
01:32:37,261 --> 01:32:38,929
We haven't communicated since the vigil.

1661
01:32:39,096 --> 01:32:40,306
Okay. Amy's parents?

1662
01:32:40,473 --> 01:32:41,932
- No, it's...
- More pressure.

1663
01:32:42,099 --> 01:32:45,227
We got a hurt, young girlfriend who will
no doubt go public at any moment.

1664
01:32:45,394 --> 01:32:46,874
- No, Andie won't do that.
- She will.

1665
01:32:46,937 --> 01:32:48,647
They always do.
Don't take it personally.

1666
01:32:49,148 --> 01:32:51,317
Amy's got us in an interesting bind.

1667
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:53,819
- We need to tell the cops about Andie.
- Really?

1668
01:32:53,986 --> 01:32:56,155
Right now,
Andie just gives you another motive.

1669
01:32:56,989 --> 01:32:58,157
We need to tell the cops
about the woodshed.

1670
01:32:58,449 --> 01:32:59,742
We need to be on the front end of that.

1671
01:32:59,909 --> 01:33:02,244
But I'm gonna warn you
as to what will happen.

1672
01:33:02,828 --> 01:33:03,913
They'll go after Margo.

1673
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:04,955
They can't do that, can they?

1674
01:33:05,122 --> 01:33:06,916
She's your accomplice.
She helped you hide the evidence.

1675
01:33:07,083 --> 01:33:09,168
In all likelihood,
she knows that you killed Amy.

1676
01:33:10,086 --> 01:33:11,504
God.

1677
01:33:11,837 --> 01:33:13,798
Well, what are we going to do?

1678
01:33:13,964 --> 01:33:14,964
We find Amy.

1679
01:33:15,257 --> 01:33:17,468
No. Any other strategy
is missing the point.

1680
01:33:17,635 --> 01:33:19,875
I've got two ex-Secret Service guys
that are really good.

1681
01:33:20,012 --> 01:33:21,514
I'll put them on it.

1682
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:23,099
But where do they start, Nick?

1683
01:33:23,474 --> 01:33:24,600
Where would Amy go?

1684
01:33:26,769 --> 01:33:28,395
I have no idea.

1685
01:33:32,858 --> 01:33:35,486
Are we keeping score?

1686
01:33:36,153 --> 01:33:37,530
Hey!

1687
01:33:39,156 --> 01:33:42,201
I thought we were steering clear
of men for a while.

1688
01:33:42,368 --> 01:33:43,368
He's nice.

1689
01:33:43,369 --> 01:33:45,871
Because he wants to fuck you.

1690
01:33:47,498 --> 01:33:49,041
She's still moping about her ex?

1691
01:33:50,835 --> 01:33:53,504
He got cheated on, too.

1692
01:33:56,882 --> 01:33:59,635
We three are the
saddest sacks in all the Ozarks.

1693
01:33:59,802 --> 01:34:01,345
I'm not sad.

1694
01:34:01,887 --> 01:34:02,887
I'm angry.

1695
01:34:02,888 --> 01:34:04,557
There you go.

1696
01:34:04,723 --> 01:34:07,226
I almost drank myself to death
when my wife left me.

1697
01:34:07,393 --> 01:34:09,520
I was gonna kill myself.
Can you believe that?

1698
01:34:09,687 --> 01:34:10,807
Don't give him the pleasure.

1699
01:34:10,855 --> 01:34:13,858
I was going to drown myself
in the Gulf of Mexico...

1700
01:34:14,024 --> 01:34:16,402
let myself be dinner
for the great whites.

1701
01:34:16,569 --> 01:34:18,237
Gulf is bull sharks, Miss Nawlins.

1702
01:34:18,404 --> 01:34:22,199
Why should I die? I'm not the asshole.

1703
01:34:22,366 --> 01:34:24,827
Please put that on a T-shirt.

1704
01:34:33,377 --> 01:34:35,754
Miss Moneybags.
I thought you said you were broke.

1705
01:34:37,256 --> 01:34:38,549
That's a fat wad.

1706
01:34:40,342 --> 01:34:42,011
It's mostly singles.

1707
01:34:42,178 --> 01:34:44,054
Singles? What are you, a stripper?

1708
01:34:44,847 --> 01:34:47,433
Swamp Girls, or Treasure Chest?

1709
01:34:48,559 --> 01:34:49,602
We're just teasing.

1710
01:34:50,394 --> 01:34:52,188
Don't they tease people down in NOLA?

1711
01:34:54,607 --> 01:34:57,443
We can expect Nick Dunne's arrest
any day now.

1712
01:34:57,610 --> 01:35:01,197
We've got blood in the house,
huge debt, an unwanted pregnancy.

1713
01:35:01,363 --> 01:35:05,201
And we have Amy Elliott Dunne,
missing for five days...

1714
01:35:05,367 --> 01:35:07,494
crying out for justice.

1715
01:35:08,287 --> 01:35:09,997
We'll be right back.

1716
01:36:02,258 --> 01:36:04,718
Tanner has a very bad idea
he's going to pitch you.

1717
01:36:04,885 --> 01:36:05,552
Yeah?

1718
01:36:05,719 --> 01:36:07,179
You're doing Sharon Schieber
tomorrow in St. Louis.

1719
01:36:07,346 --> 01:36:08,346
It could go so wrong.

1720
01:36:08,389 --> 01:36:10,029
And you are going
to tell her about Andie.

1721
01:36:10,182 --> 01:36:11,350
Nope.

1722
01:36:11,517 --> 01:36:13,394
That sounds like a very bad idea.

1723
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:15,521
You haven't heard from her
in three days.

1724
01:36:15,688 --> 01:36:19,275
This is a ticking time bomb.
You've gotta throw yourself on it.

1725
01:36:19,441 --> 01:36:21,881
- People are gonna hate me.
- And then, they will forgive you.

1726
01:36:22,027 --> 01:36:24,363
A guy admitting that he's a
gigantic asshole on television?

1727
01:36:24,530 --> 01:36:26,198
People empathize with that.

1728
01:36:27,616 --> 01:36:29,410
- Why don't we just put out a statement?
- They need to see you.

1729
01:36:29,576 --> 01:36:32,538
Sharon's specials,
they get 10 million viewers.

1730
01:36:32,705 --> 01:36:35,082
She is a crusader.
If she takes you on as a cause...

1731
01:36:35,249 --> 01:36:37,042
She's going to ask real questions.

1732
01:36:37,209 --> 01:36:38,919
I will drill you
as if you were doing a deposition.

1733
01:36:39,086 --> 01:36:40,421
What to say, what not to say.

1734
01:36:40,587 --> 01:36:41,588
A trained monkey?

1735
01:36:41,755 --> 01:36:43,875
A trained monkey
who doesn't get the lethal injection.

1736
01:36:45,134 --> 01:36:48,470
Nick, this case
is about what people think of you.

1737
01:36:48,637 --> 01:36:50,264
They need to like you.

1738
01:36:50,431 --> 01:36:54,268
Now, you do this and you will reach
millions of those people.

1739
01:36:55,436 --> 01:36:57,938
Maybe I only need to reach one.

1740
01:37:07,406 --> 01:37:08,073
Hello?

1741
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:09,450
Hey, baby.

1742
01:37:10,909 --> 01:37:12,494
One minute.

1743
01:37:21,253 --> 01:37:22,588
- Hey.
- Hey.

1744
01:37:22,755 --> 01:37:23,755
You clearing out?

1745
01:37:23,756 --> 01:37:25,466
No, I'm just cleaning up.

1746
01:37:25,632 --> 01:37:27,092
Let us come in and say goodbye.

1747
01:37:27,259 --> 01:37:28,259
I'll come by before...

1748
01:37:28,344 --> 01:37:30,095
Let us give you a hand.

1749
01:37:36,268 --> 01:37:38,729
Yeah, you gotta
clear everything out, here.

1750
01:37:40,397 --> 01:37:43,108
Dorothy is a real stickler.

1751
01:37:44,443 --> 01:37:47,738
Not even a spare hanger
can you leave behind.

1752
01:37:50,324 --> 01:37:51,924
Gotta make sure nothing's tucked inside.

1753
01:37:54,411 --> 01:37:55,412
A sock...

1754
01:37:56,330 --> 01:37:59,124
or undies or what have you.

1755
01:38:03,962 --> 01:38:05,297
You did a real good job.

1756
01:38:07,299 --> 01:38:09,426
Where is the money, sweetheart?

1757
01:38:13,097 --> 01:38:14,097
Look under her dress.

1758
01:38:15,641 --> 01:38:16,767
He talked you into this?

1759
01:38:16,934 --> 01:38:18,143
I talked him into it.

1760
01:38:18,310 --> 01:38:20,312
The second you leave,
I'm calling the cops.

1761
01:38:20,813 --> 01:38:24,358
Your glasses are fake.
Your hair's dyed all hamster.

1762
01:38:24,525 --> 01:38:27,486
You say your name's Nancy, but you
don't even answer to it half the time.

1763
01:38:27,653 --> 01:38:29,988
You're hiding. I don't know why,
and I don't really care.

1764
01:38:30,155 --> 01:38:32,199
But you ain't gonna call the cops.

1765
01:38:32,533 --> 01:38:34,613
And I don't think you've
ever really been hit before.

1766
01:38:40,833 --> 01:38:42,835
Holy shit.

1767
01:38:45,879 --> 01:38:48,549
Sorry, but we really need the money.

1768
01:38:48,715 --> 01:38:50,217
Next place, be more careful, okay?

1769
01:38:50,384 --> 01:38:52,744
There are a lot of people out there
a lot worse than we are.

1770
01:39:27,337 --> 01:39:28,964
Excuse me. You can't sleep here.

1771
01:39:56,575 --> 01:39:59,661
I did not kill my wife.

1772
01:40:00,662 --> 01:40:03,832
Why don't you try it again?
A little less wooden.

1773
01:40:03,999 --> 01:40:05,083
I didn't kill my Wife.

1774
01:40:06,919 --> 01:40:08,504
- What are you doing?
- Every time you look smug...

1775
01:40:08,670 --> 01:40:11,215
or annoyed or tense,
I'm gonna hit you with a gummy bear.

1776
01:40:11,381 --> 01:40:13,217
- That's supposed to make me less tense?
- Let's try it again.

1777
01:40:13,383 --> 01:40:16,678
Mr. Dunne, from what I understand,
you and your wife had some bumps.

1778
01:40:17,721 --> 01:40:21,558
Yeah, we had some tough years.
I lost my job.

1779
01:40:21,725 --> 01:40:22,726
You both did.

1780
01:40:25,437 --> 01:40:27,189
We both lost ourjobs.

1781
01:40:27,356 --> 01:40:29,775
I had to move back home
so we could take care of my mother...

1782
01:40:29,942 --> 01:40:32,361
who was dying of cancer
and my dad, who had...

1783
01:40:32,528 --> 01:40:34,154
Your dad's scorched earth.

1784
01:40:34,321 --> 01:40:35,864
Let's talk about your mom,
how close you were.

1785
01:40:36,031 --> 01:40:37,074
Go on.

1786
01:40:37,241 --> 01:40:39,618
For a while,
things had been building up.

1787
01:40:39,785 --> 01:40:43,163
"Built up" implies that an explosion
is coming. No.

1788
01:40:43,330 --> 01:40:45,749
At a certain point,
we got on the wrong track.

1789
01:40:46,583 --> 01:40:48,085
I had a moment of weakness.

1790
01:40:48,252 --> 01:40:50,671
Your "moment" was over 15 months.

1791
01:40:54,466 --> 01:40:56,552
I disrespected my wife.

1792
01:40:57,219 --> 01:40:59,638
And I disrespected my marriage.

1793
01:41:00,097 --> 01:41:01,473
And I'll always regret it.

1794
01:41:02,224 --> 01:41:02,933
That works.

1795
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:05,394
Don't be afraid to play up
the dufus husband thing, Nick.

1796
01:41:05,561 --> 01:41:07,145
"L was an idiot. I'm a fuck-up. "

1797
01:41:07,312 --> 01:41:08,021
"Everything I do is wrong. "

1798
01:41:08,188 --> 01:41:10,232
I know.
What men are supposed to do in general.

1799
01:41:12,359 --> 01:41:13,277
- Thank you.
- How do you feel?

1800
01:41:13,443 --> 01:41:16,655
I feel good.
Go, can you pass me that box, please?

1801
01:41:17,072 --> 01:41:19,575
It's Amy's 33rd birthday present
to me.

1802
01:41:19,741 --> 01:41:20,741
You hate that watch.

1803
01:41:20,784 --> 01:41:22,744
No, Go. I love that watch.

1804
01:41:22,911 --> 01:41:24,788
Just like I love this tie.

1805
01:41:24,955 --> 01:41:28,083
Just like I love my wife.

1806
01:41:58,447 --> 01:41:59,698
It's you!

1807
01:41:59,865 --> 01:42:01,867
It's you.

1808
01:42:02,701 --> 01:42:04,703
I'm sorry.

1809
01:42:05,370 --> 01:42:06,705
I'm sorry.

1810
01:42:07,623 --> 01:42:09,499
Good God.

1811
01:42:09,666 --> 01:42:11,043
Last week...

1812
01:42:11,543 --> 01:42:16,715
I threatened to leave, and he said
he'd find me and he'd kill me.

1813
01:42:17,049 --> 01:42:19,217
So, I disappeared.

1814
01:42:20,385 --> 01:42:22,220
I lost the baby.

1815
01:42:22,721 --> 01:42:24,389
I couldn't even tell my parents.

1816
01:42:24,556 --> 01:42:28,477
I'm so ashamed and I'm so afraid.

1817
01:42:29,227 --> 01:42:30,395
Well, he is looking for you.

1818
01:42:31,063 --> 01:42:32,898
He showed up on my doorstep
three days ago.

1819
01:42:33,065 --> 01:42:35,567
He tracked me from my letters to you.

1820
01:42:36,693 --> 01:42:37,903
You saved them.

1821
01:42:38,487 --> 01:42:39,404
Knowing you were out there...

1822
01:42:39,571 --> 01:42:42,074
was the only thing that's kept me going
these past few years.

1823
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:43,492
Let's go to the police.
You can explain everything.

1824
01:42:43,659 --> 01:42:44,826
No, I can't turn up now.

1825
01:42:44,993 --> 01:42:48,080
I'd be a pariah. Everyone would hate me.

1826
01:42:49,915 --> 01:42:52,084
Is it wrong to want Nick to go to prison?

1827
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:54,086
He should go to prison
for what he's done.

1828
01:42:56,922 --> 01:42:59,257
I'm setting you up at my lake house.

1829
01:42:59,424 --> 01:43:00,425
It's utterly secluded.

1830
01:43:01,843 --> 01:43:03,553
Why are you so good to me?

1831
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:04,930
You know why.

1832
01:43:05,097 --> 01:43:06,098
Excuse me.

1833
01:43:06,264 --> 01:43:07,265
I know you, don't I?

1834
01:43:07,432 --> 01:43:08,100
No.

1835
01:43:08,266 --> 01:43:10,102
You're one of the Nolan girls, right?

1836
01:43:10,268 --> 01:43:13,021
No, we're from Winnipeg. Excuse us.

1837
01:43:13,188 --> 01:43:13,939
We should leave.

1838
01:43:14,106 --> 01:43:15,190
Just a second.

1839
01:43:15,774 --> 01:43:18,902
That was Boney. I'll call her later.

1840
01:43:19,069 --> 01:43:20,946
Tanner. Nice to see you.

1841
01:43:21,238 --> 01:43:22,239
Sharon! Hi.

1842
01:43:22,406 --> 01:43:23,949
Hope this is worth my while.

1843
01:43:24,116 --> 01:43:25,242
You're gonna be very happy.

1844
01:43:25,701 --> 01:43:26,368
Sharon.

1845
01:43:26,535 --> 01:43:28,620
Ms. Schieber.
Thank you so much for doing this.

1846
01:43:28,787 --> 01:43:30,789
Can I get you anything to drink or eat
before we get started?

1847
01:43:30,956 --> 01:43:32,958
No, I had some gummy bears.

1848
01:43:34,042 --> 01:43:35,627
What the fuck?

1849
01:43:36,795 --> 01:43:37,921
I'm sorry?

1850
01:43:38,338 --> 01:43:42,092
We have a major shocking development
in the Amazing Amy disappearance.

1851
01:43:42,259 --> 01:43:43,510
We go live to that story now.

1852
01:43:43,677 --> 01:43:44,970
Oh, my God.

1853
01:43:47,139 --> 01:43:48,807
You little slut.

1854
01:43:48,974 --> 01:43:51,977
My name is Andie Fitzgerald.

1855
01:43:52,978 --> 01:43:54,521
I met Nicholas Dunne...

1856
01:43:54,688 --> 01:43:58,191
when he was my creative writing teacher
at Mill Valley.

1857
01:43:58,358 --> 01:44:00,318
Why is she dressed like a babysitter?

1858
01:44:00,485 --> 01:44:01,820
I am deeply ashamed...

1859
01:44:01,987 --> 01:44:04,990
of having been romantically involved
with a married man.

1860
01:44:05,157 --> 01:44:06,950
The girl with the giant cum-on-me tits.

1861
01:44:07,117 --> 01:44:08,994
I truly believed we were in love.

1862
01:44:09,161 --> 01:44:10,996
Now, she looks like a fucking Mennonite.

1863
01:44:12,497 --> 01:44:13,832
I know that is no excuse.

1864
01:44:13,999 --> 01:44:15,167
No, it is not.

1865
01:44:15,333 --> 01:44:19,546
L do not, in my heart, believe
Nick Dunne would have killed for me.

1866
01:44:19,713 --> 01:44:22,007
My prayers go out to everyone
who loves Amy.

1867
01:44:22,174 --> 01:44:25,177
I apologize for the pain
this has caused them.

1868
01:44:30,390 --> 01:44:32,350
We have loved Nick Dunne like a son.

1869
01:44:33,185 --> 01:44:34,561
That love ended today.

1870
01:44:34,853 --> 01:44:36,354
Come on, you're staring at ghosts.

1871
01:44:36,521 --> 01:44:39,191
He met our trust with lie after lie.

1872
01:44:39,524 --> 01:44:41,318
We now absolutely believe...

1873
01:44:41,485 --> 01:44:43,737
Nick is involved in the disappearance
of our daughter.

1874
01:44:43,904 --> 01:44:46,156
Our Amazing Amy.

1875
01:44:47,032 --> 01:44:49,159
This just got very exciting.

1876
01:44:49,868 --> 01:44:51,578
We need a moment.

1877
01:44:53,580 --> 01:44:55,207
We're gonna have to bow out of this.

1878
01:44:55,373 --> 01:44:57,042
- Nothing has changed.
- Everything has changed.

1879
01:44:57,209 --> 01:44:59,503
An hour ago, we were ahead of this. Now?

1880
01:44:59,669 --> 01:45:01,171
- I can handle this.
- We're on the defense.

1881
01:45:01,338 --> 01:45:03,256
This is a completely different dynamic.

1882
01:45:03,423 --> 01:45:06,176
- I can handle it.
- She's going to eat you alive.

1883
01:45:06,718 --> 01:45:08,386
Just trust me.

1884
01:45:12,766 --> 01:45:14,017
Okay.

1885
01:45:14,184 --> 01:45:15,268
Great.

1886
01:45:16,102 --> 01:45:17,562
Mic him.

1887
01:45:37,290 --> 01:45:39,084
One, two, three, four, five.

1888
01:45:45,423 --> 01:45:46,423
Thank you.

1889
01:45:47,592 --> 01:45:48,760
He shouldn't smile at the makeup artist.

1890
01:45:48,927 --> 01:45:49,928
Yeah, no kidding.

1891
01:45:54,599 --> 01:45:57,602
Roll tape. Five... four...

1892
01:45:57,769 --> 01:45:59,396
three... two...

1893
01:46:01,606 --> 01:46:04,401
Seriously, I can't believe
how fucking good you were.

1894
01:46:04,568 --> 01:46:06,048
- Amy brings out the best in me.
- Doni.

1895
01:46:06,069 --> 01:46:09,114
Keep it together, you two.
At least for the next 24 hours.

1896
01:46:09,281 --> 01:46:11,601
People still hate you.
Women want to scratch your eyes out.

1897
01:46:11,741 --> 01:46:13,493
Andie was really good TV.

1898
01:46:13,660 --> 01:46:15,620
- She's a good person.
- Therein lies the problem.

1899
01:46:15,745 --> 01:46:16,745
Ride this out...

1900
01:46:16,788 --> 01:46:19,666
and when Sharon airs tomorrow,
we'll be looking at a whole new you.

1901
01:46:19,833 --> 01:46:21,293
But, until then...

1902
01:46:21,459 --> 01:46:23,295
don't show your face.

1903
01:46:23,461 --> 01:46:25,297
No problem.

1904
01:46:41,605 --> 01:46:42,981
Welcome.

1905
01:46:44,983 --> 01:46:46,693
Make yourself at home.

1906
01:46:46,860 --> 01:46:50,697
I've got music, satellite...

1907
01:46:50,864 --> 01:46:51,864
NetfliX.

1908
01:46:51,865 --> 01:46:52,865
He was her teacher!

1909
01:46:52,991 --> 01:46:53,991
Roku.

1910
01:46:54,534 --> 01:46:57,037
Internet, obviously.

1911
01:46:57,621 --> 01:47:00,206
Here is a supposedly grown man...

1912
01:47:00,373 --> 01:47:04,044
If there is ever anything you have
a taste for and you can't find it...

1913
01:47:04,210 --> 01:47:06,338
just let me know
and I will get it for you.

1914
01:47:06,504 --> 01:47:09,507
Instead of the A-B-C's,
he taught her the birds and the bees.

1915
01:47:09,674 --> 01:47:12,469
And just think how her mother must feel
at a time like this.

1916
01:47:12,636 --> 01:47:14,638
Wine cellar's downstairs.

1917
01:47:18,099 --> 01:47:19,351
I'll get you some clothes, too.

1918
01:47:19,517 --> 01:47:22,938
Not that I don't appreciate
Bait Shop Chic.

1919
01:47:24,105 --> 01:47:26,483
The floors are heated,
just dial to your liking.

1920
01:47:26,650 --> 01:47:29,694
There's robes and towels.
The shower has steam.

1921
01:47:29,861 --> 01:47:32,197
The bathtub has a massage cycle.

1922
01:47:34,032 --> 01:47:35,951
There's a great view,
if you're in the mood.

1923
01:47:36,117 --> 01:47:37,535
Blackout curtains if you're not.

1924
01:47:37,702 --> 01:47:40,038
The bed is Savoir.

1925
01:47:40,205 --> 01:47:42,457
You'll never get a better sleep.

1926
01:47:46,336 --> 01:47:48,672
This is just what I need.

1927
01:47:50,131 --> 01:47:52,050
I'm so exhausted.

1928
01:47:53,551 --> 01:47:55,720
Not that I don't appreciate
Bait Shop Chic.

1929
01:47:57,472 --> 01:48:00,225
Amy, I am so happy that you are here.

1930
01:48:01,226 --> 01:48:04,229
And I don't want you to worry
for one moment.

1931
01:48:04,396 --> 01:48:06,231
There are cameras everywhere.

1932
01:48:06,398 --> 01:48:09,150
The exterior, all along the grounds,
the entryway.

1933
01:48:09,317 --> 01:48:10,317
Anyone...

1934
01:48:10,485 --> 01:48:12,737
who is caught coming or going...

1935
01:48:15,991 --> 01:48:17,575
will be recorded.

1936
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:21,871
You are more than safe.

1937
01:48:23,832 --> 01:48:27,335
And I am not letting you get away again.

1938
01:49:13,089 --> 01:49:14,674
- Good morning!
- Don't do that!

1939
01:49:16,426 --> 01:49:17,552
I'm sorry.

1940
01:49:19,554 --> 01:49:21,056
I need to feel safe.

1941
01:49:21,389 --> 01:49:24,392
You are very safe.

1942
01:49:26,603 --> 01:49:28,104
- What have you been up to?
- Nothing.

1943
01:49:28,271 --> 01:49:30,857
Amy, I'm not Nick.

1944
01:49:31,024 --> 01:49:33,026
It's hard for me.

1945
01:49:35,945 --> 01:49:39,574
After so many years
under someone's thumb...

1946
01:49:41,826 --> 01:49:43,146
I know just what that feels like.

1947
01:49:44,037 --> 01:49:46,039
You were never under my thumb.

1948
01:49:46,623 --> 01:49:48,541
- On your leash.
- Never.

1949
01:49:48,708 --> 01:49:50,210
A new start.

1950
01:49:51,503 --> 01:49:53,129
Decent clothes.

1951
01:49:54,047 --> 01:49:56,299
Hair dye. Makeup. Tweezers.

1952
01:49:56,591 --> 01:49:58,093
There's a gym overlooking the lake.

1953
01:49:58,468 --> 01:50:01,888
The sooner you look like yourself,
the sooner you'll feel like yourself.

1954
01:50:02,055 --> 01:50:05,058
I'll get groceries for tonight, we'll watch
Sharon Schieber, and finally move on.

1955
01:50:05,225 --> 01:50:07,769
I think that's something
I should watch on my own.

1956
01:50:08,186 --> 01:50:09,896
Nonsense.

1957
01:50:13,525 --> 01:50:14,943
I'll be back.

1958
01:50:16,569 --> 01:50:18,613
And I am looking forward...

1959
01:50:18,780 --> 01:50:21,699
to my reunion with Amy Elliott.

1960
01:50:44,889 --> 01:50:46,057
Great.

1961
01:50:47,100 --> 01:50:49,060
Good evening, I'm Sharon Schieber.

1962
01:50:49,227 --> 01:50:50,867
<i>- Tonight, exclusively...
- H u rry u p.</i>

1963
01:50:51,771 --> 01:50:56,025
A husband breaks his silence,
not just on his wife's disappearance...

1964
01:50:56,192 --> 01:50:59,988
but on his infidelity,
and all those shocking rumors.

1965
01:51:02,448 --> 01:51:03,867
Nick Dunne...

1966
01:51:04,033 --> 01:51:07,412
you're probably the most hated man
in America right now.

1967
01:51:07,579 --> 01:51:10,039
I probably am.
And I probably deserve it.

1968
01:51:10,206 --> 01:51:11,666
I bought that tie.

1969
01:51:11,833 --> 01:51:13,751
Did you kill your Wife, Nick?

1970
01:51:13,918 --> 01:51:17,005
I did not kill my wife.

1971
01:51:17,672 --> 01:51:19,090
I am not a murderer.

1972
01:51:19,257 --> 01:51:21,050
But you were unfaithful.

1973
01:51:21,217 --> 01:51:23,303
I was unfaithful.

1974
01:51:23,469 --> 01:51:25,013
And I am deeply ashamed.

1975
01:51:25,180 --> 01:51:27,515
And, on top of that,
you allowed Amy's parents...

1976
01:51:27,807 --> 01:51:30,435
her friends,
all the people in your hometown...

1977
01:51:30,602 --> 01:51:35,398
believe you were a loving husband,
desperate to find his missing wife.

1978
01:51:35,565 --> 01:51:37,325
Well, I am desperate
to find my missing wife.

1979
01:51:37,483 --> 01:51:40,361
You say that, but I'm wondering
how you expect us to believe you...

1980
01:51:40,528 --> 01:51:42,238
now that we know you're a liar.

1981
01:51:42,530 --> 01:51:45,533
I didn't come fon/vard with my affair...

1982
01:51:45,700 --> 01:51:48,870
because I knew it would make me look
really, really bad.

1983
01:51:49,704 --> 01:51:51,372
But I don't care about that anymore.

1984
01:51:51,539 --> 01:51:53,041
I just want to find my wife.

1985
01:51:53,208 --> 01:51:55,627
- I'm just trying to get clear...
- Let me be clear.

1986
01:51:55,793 --> 01:52:00,089
Just because I am not a murderer
doesn't make me a good guy.

1987
01:52:00,256 --> 01:52:01,424
I'm not a good guy.

1988
01:52:01,841 --> 01:52:04,302
I was a bad husband to a great wife.

1989
01:52:04,677 --> 01:52:06,429
I broke the vow that I made to her.

1990
01:52:06,679 --> 01:52:09,224
Those are pretty words, Nick.

1991
01:52:09,557 --> 01:52:11,184
But what does that really mean to you?

1992
01:52:11,351 --> 01:52:13,394
It basically means
that I was a con artist.

1993
01:52:14,354 --> 01:52:17,440
<i>I met Amy Elliott seven years ago.</i>

1994
01:52:17,607 --> 01:52:19,192
I was completely transfixed.

1995
01:52:19,651 --> 01:52:21,444
Amy can do that to you.

1996
01:52:21,611 --> 01:52:24,030
I was this average guy
from an average place...

1997
01:52:24,197 --> 01:52:26,074
with mediocre aspirations.

1998
01:52:26,241 --> 01:52:28,618
And I met a woman who dazzled me.

1999
01:52:28,785 --> 01:52:30,620
And I wanted her to love me...

2000
01:52:30,787 --> 01:52:33,122
so I pretended to be better than I was.

2001
01:52:33,998 --> 01:52:37,543
<i>When we got married,
I promised to be that guy.</i>

2002
01:52:37,710 --> 01:52:39,420
That guy who works harder.

2003
01:52:39,587 --> 01:52:41,673
That guy who, who lives and acts...

2004
01:52:41,839 --> 01:52:44,759
and loves with as much passion
as she does.

2005
01:52:45,009 --> 01:52:46,219
But I failed her.

2006
01:52:47,136 --> 01:52:48,496
Instead of doing what was right...

2007
01:52:49,764 --> 01:52:50,932
I did what was easy.

2008
01:52:51,683 --> 01:52:55,186
You talk like a man who believes
he can make amends to his wife.

2009
01:52:55,353 --> 01:52:56,854
Who believes his wife is still alive.

2010
01:52:57,021 --> 01:52:58,314
She is still alive.

2011
01:53:00,191 --> 01:53:03,027
Will you look at that camera for me?

2012
01:53:03,361 --> 01:53:06,197
Will you look in the lens...

2013
01:53:06,364 --> 01:53:08,199
and talk to your wife?

2014
01:53:08,366 --> 01:53:11,327
If she is out there,
able to hear and see you tonight...

2015
01:53:11,494 --> 01:53:14,163
what would you like to say to her, Nick?

2016
01:53:17,709 --> 01:53:20,003
<i>Amy, I love you.</i>

2017
01:53:20,712 --> 01:53:23,381
You're the best person I've ever known.

2018
01:53:23,548 --> 01:53:27,885
And I've taken myself to the woodshed
for the way that I've treated you.

2019
01:53:28,052 --> 01:53:29,887
And if you come back, I promise...

2020
01:53:30,054 --> 01:53:32,557
I will spend every day
making it up to you.

2021
01:53:33,057 --> 01:53:36,894
I will be the man
that I promised you I would be.

2022
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:40,481
<i>I love you.</i>

2023
01:53:41,399 --> 01:53:42,984
Come home.

2024
01:53:47,739 --> 01:53:48,740
Here.

2025
01:53:54,871 --> 01:53:56,372
Regardless of what you thought...

2026
01:53:56,539 --> 01:53:58,583
What does it say?

2027
01:53:58,750 --> 01:54:00,168
L think we can all agree...

2028
01:54:00,335 --> 01:54:01,711
Oh, my God. You fucking killed it.

2029
01:54:01,878 --> 01:54:02,920
There's more to him
than meets the eye.

2030
01:54:03,087 --> 01:54:04,207
They're going crazy for you.

2031
01:54:04,213 --> 01:54:08,593
They disliked me, they liked me,
they hated me.

2032
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:10,261
And now they love me.

2033
01:54:10,428 --> 01:54:13,264
A candor and an honesty
that's worthy of respect.

2034
01:54:13,431 --> 01:54:15,350
He's certainly earned mine.

2035
01:54:16,184 --> 01:54:17,268
What is it?

2036
01:54:20,104 --> 01:54:23,274
I'm Sharon Schieber. Good night.

2037
01:54:28,196 --> 01:54:30,865
Margo Dunne, this is a search warrant
for your property.

2038
01:54:31,032 --> 01:54:33,117
I usually ignore tipline calls...

2039
01:54:33,284 --> 01:54:37,872
but a neighbor was concerned about
a strange man around your woodshed.

2040
01:54:38,289 --> 01:54:39,289
Call Tanner.

2041
01:54:39,290 --> 01:54:40,458
Okay. Fuck!

2042
01:54:44,587 --> 01:54:46,047
Girlfriend's real cute, Nick.

2043
01:54:47,298 --> 01:54:48,378
Is that what this is about?

2044
01:54:49,801 --> 01:54:54,430
I have treated you more than fair
throughout this entire investigation.

2045
01:54:54,597 --> 01:54:56,766
I gave you the benefit of the doubt
over and over.

2046
01:54:56,933 --> 01:54:58,309
Every time you said something stupid...

2047
01:54:58,476 --> 01:55:00,728
I thought, "Maybe he's just stupid. "

2048
01:55:00,895 --> 01:55:03,314
But I was wrong.
That's what this is about.

2049
01:55:03,481 --> 01:55:04,482
Are these the clubs
you don't play golf with?

2050
01:55:04,649 --> 01:55:05,649
None of that is mine.

2051
01:55:05,942 --> 01:55:07,402
None of this was put here by me.

2052
01:55:07,568 --> 01:55:10,988
Those are nice clubs.
You got the makings of a real man cave.

2053
01:55:11,155 --> 01:55:14,158
Everything just waiting
until the wife goes away for good.

2054
01:55:14,325 --> 01:55:15,410
Nick!

2055
01:55:16,661 --> 01:55:19,580
- You can't do that!
- Of course we can.

2056
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:30,341
Amy, it's time to move on.

2057
01:55:30,508 --> 01:55:32,218
What can I do to help?

2058
01:55:32,927 --> 01:55:34,345
I need some time to think.

2059
01:55:34,512 --> 01:55:36,889
- That's the last thing you need.
- Desi...

2060
01:55:37,056 --> 01:55:39,517
Twenty years,
you have kept me dangling.

2061
01:55:39,684 --> 01:55:43,354
Finally, last night, you came to me,
and you chose me.

2062
01:55:44,063 --> 01:55:45,273
Follow that instinct.

2063
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:47,859
Don't trust the instinct
that left you beaten and homeless...

2064
01:55:48,401 --> 01:55:51,571
sleeping in your car,
fearing for your life.

2065
01:55:54,907 --> 01:55:57,618
I'm not gonna force myself on you.

2066
01:56:00,037 --> 01:56:02,707
I understand what you're saying, Desi.

2067
01:56:03,958 --> 01:56:05,585
I do.

2068
01:56:08,921 --> 01:56:10,923
I've been so mistreated for so long.

2069
01:56:13,593 --> 01:56:16,471
I've forgotten how to behave.

2070
01:56:22,226 --> 01:56:24,395
I'll move in here tomorrow...

2071
01:56:24,562 --> 01:56:27,148
and we'll work it out together.

2072
01:56:29,233 --> 01:56:32,945
I just want you to be you again.

2073
01:56:40,786 --> 01:56:42,306
They only took Margo to fuck with you.

2074
01:56:42,330 --> 01:56:43,915
She's not spending
another fucking second in there.

2075
01:56:44,081 --> 01:56:46,834
I'm gonna go in,
and I'm gonna tell them everything.

2076
01:56:47,502 --> 01:56:49,253
What?

2077
01:56:51,255 --> 01:56:52,757
We tell Boney very little.

2078
01:56:52,924 --> 01:56:54,926
Without a body,
without a murder weapon...

2079
01:56:55,092 --> 01:56:57,261
their only hope is a confession.

2080
01:56:57,428 --> 01:56:59,263
So, you let them do all the talking.

2081
01:56:59,430 --> 01:57:01,432
That way,
we can jump-start your defense.

2082
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:03,976
The truth is my defense.

2083
01:57:09,941 --> 01:57:10,941
Recognize these?

2084
01:57:10,942 --> 01:57:12,944
Yes.
It's Amy's anniversary present to me.

2085
01:57:13,110 --> 01:57:14,779
Was that how she told you
she was pregnant, Nick?

2086
01:57:14,946 --> 01:57:17,448
Mommy, Daddy, baby,
and that made you real mad?

2087
01:57:17,949 --> 01:57:19,116
No.

2088
01:57:20,368 --> 01:57:22,488
- Recognize this?
- Never seen that before in my life.

2089
01:57:22,703 --> 01:57:25,957
It's Amy's diary.
We found this at your father's house.

2090
01:57:27,959 --> 01:57:29,239
Is this your wife's handwriting?

2091
01:57:29,293 --> 01:57:31,170
- He's not a handwriting ex...
- Looks like it.

2092
01:57:31,337 --> 01:57:32,463
Our experts thought so, too.

2093
01:57:33,798 --> 01:57:35,508
Do you wanna
play a little true or false?

2094
01:57:36,259 --> 01:57:37,343
Sure.

2095
01:57:37,510 --> 01:57:41,973
"And then he brushes the sugar off my lips
so he can taste me. "

2096
01:57:43,099 --> 01:57:45,101
Yeah, that's true.

2097
01:57:46,352 --> 01:57:48,354
You thought quinoa was a fish?

2098
01:57:49,647 --> 01:57:50,982
That is also true, yes.

2099
01:57:53,150 --> 01:57:55,152
She wanted to get pregnant,
you assaulted her.

2100
01:57:55,319 --> 01:57:57,196
I hit her? No, never happened.

2101
01:57:57,363 --> 01:57:58,864
- "Pushed," it says "pushed. "
- Absolutely not.

2102
01:57:59,031 --> 01:58:00,116
I never touched her.

2103
01:58:02,535 --> 01:58:04,161
She tried to buy a gun.

2104
01:58:04,829 --> 01:58:06,706
I doubt that, but I don't know.

2105
01:58:08,124 --> 01:58:09,625
Shall I read the last entry?

2106
01:58:09,792 --> 01:58:10,835
Sure.

2107
01:58:12,128 --> 01:58:14,130
"This man may kill me. "

2108
01:58:14,297 --> 01:58:16,382
In her own words,
"This man may kill me. "

2109
01:58:16,549 --> 01:58:18,676
It's kind of a convenient end note.

2110
01:58:25,182 --> 01:58:26,475
For future reference...

2111
01:58:26,642 --> 01:58:28,853
the truth,
you are not a handwriting expert.

2112
01:58:29,020 --> 01:58:30,062
Okay, I know.

2113
01:58:38,487 --> 01:58:40,323
Judy's missing handle.

2114
01:58:41,866 --> 01:58:44,035
Big as a two-by-four, right?
Big as a club.

2115
01:58:44,201 --> 01:58:46,829
We found this day one,
in the fireplace in your home office.

2116
01:58:46,996 --> 01:58:49,540
We didn't know what the hell it was,
but fire in July?

2117
01:58:49,707 --> 01:58:50,416
We bagged it.

2118
01:58:50,583 --> 01:58:51,584
I've never seen that before either.

2119
01:58:51,751 --> 01:58:54,253
We just tested it.
Fire doesn't erase blood, Nick.

2120
01:58:54,420 --> 01:58:56,505
So, finally, Nicholas Dunne...

2121
01:58:56,672 --> 01:58:58,174
you're under arrest
for the murder of your wife.

2122
01:58:58,341 --> 01:58:59,425
Do not say another word.

2123
01:58:59,592 --> 01:59:00,926
- What about my side?
- Nick!

2124
01:59:14,273 --> 01:59:15,608
More coffee?

2125
01:59:15,775 --> 01:59:17,568
I'd love it.

2126
01:59:19,862 --> 01:59:23,366
Remember that time we skipped school
and drove to the Cape?

2127
01:59:23,532 --> 01:59:25,951
God, yeah. Lobster right from the ocean.

2128
01:59:26,118 --> 01:59:27,745
This reminds me of that.

2129
01:59:28,245 --> 01:59:29,914
Never-ending holiday.

2130
01:59:31,457 --> 01:59:33,542
You're not bored?

2131
01:59:33,709 --> 01:59:35,086
Desi, how could I be bored?

2132
01:59:35,252 --> 01:59:37,588
You can discuss
18th-century symphonies...

2133
01:59:37,755 --> 01:59:40,675
19th-century Impressionists,
quote Proust in French.

2134
01:59:41,050 --> 01:59:45,054
Nick's idea of culture
was a reality TV marathon...

2135
01:59:45,221 --> 01:59:47,098
with one hand down his boxers.

2136
01:59:49,100 --> 01:59:50,685
I really have to get going.

2137
01:59:51,018 --> 01:59:54,355
But I will be back
just as soon as I can.

2138
02:00:00,945 --> 02:00:02,029
My keys.

2139
02:00:07,243 --> 02:00:09,245
Thank you.

2140
02:00:20,464 --> 02:00:22,049
That's how the kids wear it.

2141
02:01:22,860 --> 02:01:26,697
Dunne? You got one hell of a lawyer.

2142
02:01:29,533 --> 02:01:30,701
Hey.

2143
02:01:31,118 --> 02:01:33,370
- Are you okay?
- Yes. Are you?

2144
02:01:33,537 --> 02:01:34,663
Yeah.

2145
02:01:34,830 --> 02:01:36,707
Let's go.

2146
02:01:38,542 --> 02:01:39,627
What does this mean?

2147
02:01:39,794 --> 02:01:41,837
Well, you're out on bond.

2148
02:01:42,004 --> 02:01:45,216
You can relax at home
while we prep for trial.

2149
02:01:50,721 --> 02:01:52,723
Keep your head down.

2150
02:02:08,155 --> 02:02:10,407
Tanner, is there
any fucking lead on Amy?

2151
02:02:10,574 --> 02:02:12,576
I've got two of my best guys on it.

2152
02:02:13,077 --> 02:02:14,703
She's air.

2153
02:02:16,747 --> 02:02:19,708
Come home, Amy. I dare you.

2154
02:03:16,932 --> 02:03:19,351
Mr. Collings is home.

2155
02:03:19,518 --> 02:03:21,770
Hello, Mr. Collings.

2156
02:03:21,937 --> 02:03:23,689
I've missed you.

2157
02:03:23,856 --> 02:03:25,482
I've been thinking...

2158
02:03:25,941 --> 02:03:28,110
I don't wanna be without you.

2159
02:03:28,819 --> 02:03:31,030
Stay with me.

2160
02:03:31,196 --> 02:03:34,033
And when all this dies down,
we'll go to Greece, like you said.

2161
02:03:34,199 --> 02:03:36,493
Octopus and Scrabble?

2162
02:03:38,495 --> 02:03:40,623
How long do you think until it's done?

2163
02:03:40,789 --> 02:03:44,376
Not long. Six months for the trial.
Sentencing will be quick.

2164
02:03:44,877 --> 02:03:45,877
He'll appeal.

2165
02:03:46,003 --> 02:03:48,130
I can watch the rest overseas.

2166
02:04:05,522 --> 02:04:06,690
Go slowly.

2167
02:04:06,857 --> 02:04:07,857
But I want it.

2168
02:04:28,212 --> 02:04:29,672
Don't rush.

2169
02:04:29,838 --> 02:04:31,924
Just do it.

2170
02:04:40,391 --> 02:04:41,934
Harder.

2171
02:06:20,491 --> 02:06:23,660
You fucking bitch.

2172
02:06:32,336 --> 02:06:36,006
Don't you worry,
you're gonna have lots of babies.

2173
02:06:37,633 --> 02:06:41,011
Her wounds are consistent with rape.
There was semen present.

2174
02:06:41,178 --> 02:06:42,338
We'll make sure it's a match.

2175
02:06:42,346 --> 02:06:43,972
Yeah, it'll match.

2176
02:06:44,139 --> 02:06:46,475
Thank you very much.

2177
02:06:46,642 --> 02:06:48,018
What do you think?

2178
02:06:48,185 --> 02:06:49,353
Are we pals again?

2179
02:06:49,520 --> 02:06:52,940
Now that I know
you didn't murder your wife, yes.

2180
02:06:53,107 --> 02:06:54,107
What do you think?

2181
02:06:54,108 --> 02:06:57,027
Kidnapping? The story's insane.

2182
02:06:59,196 --> 02:07:01,532
She's on fairly heavy painkillers.

2183
02:07:01,698 --> 02:07:03,492
It's okay. I want to help.

2184
02:07:03,659 --> 02:07:04,952
Ms. Dunne, I know
what you've been through...

2185
02:07:05,119 --> 02:07:07,329
so we'll keep this very brief.

2186
02:07:07,496 --> 02:07:09,873
Can you walk us through what happened?

2187
02:07:12,501 --> 02:07:15,129
That morning, the doorbell rang.

2188
02:07:16,004 --> 02:07:17,881
So normal.

2189
02:07:18,048 --> 02:07:19,883
I opened the door.

2190
02:07:20,509 --> 02:07:22,344
So strange.

2191
02:07:22,970 --> 02:07:26,473
Since high school,
he won't ever go away.

2192
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:29,601
And I've just tried to be nice to him.

2193
02:07:29,768 --> 02:07:31,395
Answer his letters.

2194
02:07:31,645 --> 02:07:33,647
Keep him calm.

2195
02:07:35,065 --> 02:07:36,525
Oh, my God.

2196
02:07:37,151 --> 02:07:38,652
I've encouraged him.

2197
02:07:38,819 --> 02:07:40,612
You can't blame yourself.

2198
02:07:42,239 --> 02:07:44,408
He pushed inside.

2199
02:07:45,993 --> 02:07:48,036
And he grabbed me.

2200
02:07:48,745 --> 02:07:51,832
But I got away, and ran to the kitchen.

2201
02:07:52,166 --> 02:07:53,876
And he clubbed me.

2202
02:07:54,334 --> 02:07:55,627
Icoflapsed.

2203
02:07:55,794 --> 02:07:59,715
That club was actually the handle
to a Punch and Judy puppet.

2204
02:07:59,882 --> 02:08:01,300
Right.

2205
02:08:02,217 --> 02:08:03,635
Treasure hunt.

2206
02:08:05,554 --> 02:08:07,472
I'd hidden some puppets at Go's...

2207
02:08:07,639 --> 02:08:09,349
Then how did Desi have that handle?

2208
02:08:11,226 --> 02:08:13,145
I'd just found it.

2209
02:08:13,896 --> 02:08:16,315
It must have fallen off.

2210
02:08:18,233 --> 02:08:21,778
I was holding it when Desi pushed in.
So, he got it from me.

2211
02:08:21,945 --> 02:08:23,030
About that woodshed...

2212
02:08:23,197 --> 02:08:24,865
He took me to his lake house.

2213
02:08:25,449 --> 02:08:27,034
Tied me to his bed.

2214
02:08:27,201 --> 02:08:29,620
Back to the woodshed real quick.
Real quick.

2215
02:08:29,786 --> 02:08:31,496
When you went
to place the puppets there...

2216
02:08:31,663 --> 02:08:33,063
did you notice that it was packed...

2217
02:08:33,081 --> 02:08:34,124
Lots of stuff.

2218
02:08:34,291 --> 02:08:38,587
Corresponding to purchases made
on credit cards in your husband's name.

2219
02:08:38,754 --> 02:08:40,130
Nick and credit cards.

2220
02:08:40,297 --> 02:08:42,716
He buys, I nag. I don't know, probably.

2221
02:08:42,883 --> 02:08:45,677
He hid a lot of stuff at Go's.
They're very close.

2222
02:08:46,220 --> 02:08:50,432
Now, may I go back
to where I was being held prisoner...

2223
02:08:50,599 --> 02:08:53,227
by a man with a history
of mental problems?

2224
02:08:53,393 --> 02:08:54,473
Please continue, Ms. Dunne.

2225
02:08:58,774 --> 02:09:00,859
Desi assaulted me that night.

2226
02:09:01,818 --> 02:09:03,654
Every night.

2227
02:09:04,780 --> 02:09:07,199
He tied me up like a dog.

2228
02:09:08,575 --> 02:09:11,078
And then, he'd punish me.

2229
02:09:12,996 --> 02:09:15,040
Starve me.

2230
02:09:16,333 --> 02:09:18,252
Shave me.

2231
02:09:19,878 --> 02:09:21,838
Sodomize me.

2232
02:09:22,631 --> 02:09:24,341
There were cameras everywhere.

2233
02:09:24,508 --> 02:09:27,469
Please find this. Please find the tapes.

2234
02:09:29,137 --> 02:09:32,349
She slit his throat with a box cutter.

2235
02:09:33,433 --> 02:09:35,519
How did she manage
to get a hold of a box cutter...

2236
02:09:35,686 --> 02:09:38,272
if he had her tied up the whole time?

2237
02:09:39,231 --> 02:09:41,275
Can't you just be happy
your wife is home and safe?

2238
02:09:42,067 --> 02:09:43,902
Amy, we found your diary.

2239
02:09:44,069 --> 02:09:48,031
It contains many concerning allegations
of mental and physical abuse.

2240
02:09:48,198 --> 02:09:51,076
Well, it's the ugly truth.

2241
02:09:51,910 --> 02:09:53,412
Nick didn't want a baby.

2242
02:09:55,247 --> 02:09:58,542
He has a temper. We had money problems.

2243
02:09:59,459 --> 02:10:00,460
But I love him.

2244
02:10:00,627 --> 02:10:02,379
Then why did you try to buy a gun?

2245
02:10:04,339 --> 02:10:06,300
I'm sorry, I feel myself fading.

2246
02:10:06,466 --> 02:10:08,176
If I could just clarify one thing...

2247
02:10:08,343 --> 02:10:11,430
If this case had been left
in your deeply incompetent hands...

2248
02:10:11,596 --> 02:10:13,473
my husband would be on death row...

2249
02:10:13,765 --> 02:10:17,519
and I'd be tied, still, spread-eagle...

2250
02:10:17,811 --> 02:10:21,481
Ms. Dunne, you've been very brave.
We're finished.

2251
02:10:22,357 --> 02:10:24,401
Now, I have to ask you...

2252
02:10:24,568 --> 02:10:27,404
do you feel safe
going home with your husband?

2253
02:10:39,833 --> 02:10:42,336
We prayed to God,
and God has answered our prayers.

2254
02:10:42,502 --> 02:10:43,754
Amy Dunne is home.

2255
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:45,881
Now, I know there are
a lot of questions and concerns...

2256
02:10:46,048 --> 02:10:47,924
but for right now, we wanna sit tight...

2257
02:10:48,091 --> 02:10:53,013
and just be thankful and grateful
for this miracle on the Mississippi.

2258
02:11:00,479 --> 02:11:02,272
Excuse me. Excuse us, folks.

2259
02:11:54,032 --> 02:11:55,242
We love you, Amy!

2260
02:11:59,871 --> 02:12:01,581
All right, you can stop pretending now.

2261
02:12:01,748 --> 02:12:03,417
I'm not pretending.

2262
02:12:04,126 --> 02:12:05,836
You were perfect.

2263
02:12:06,461 --> 02:12:08,880
The Nick I saw on TV,
that's the Nick I fell in love with.

2264
02:12:09,047 --> 02:12:11,647
You do know I was just telling you
what you wanted to hear, right?

2265
02:12:11,800 --> 02:12:13,510
That's how well you know me.

2266
02:12:13,677 --> 02:12:16,304
You know me in your marrow.

2267
02:12:17,305 --> 02:12:18,765
Okay.

2268
02:12:18,932 --> 02:12:22,269
You need to tell me
exactly what happened.

2269
02:12:23,562 --> 02:12:24,813
Take off your clothes.

2270
02:12:25,313 --> 02:12:28,525
I need to make sure
you're not wearing a wire.

2271
02:12:41,830 --> 02:12:45,709
You killed someone, Amy.
You're a murderer.

2272
02:12:45,876 --> 02:12:47,335
I'm a fighter.

2273
02:12:47,502 --> 02:12:49,838
I fought my way back to you.

2274
02:12:50,005 --> 02:12:51,673
You killed a guy.

2275
02:12:51,882 --> 02:12:53,717
You slashed his throat
with a box cutter.

2276
02:12:53,884 --> 02:12:58,555
You went on national television
and begged for me to save your life.

2277
02:12:59,139 --> 02:13:00,265
And I obliged.

2278
02:13:00,432 --> 02:13:01,892
But I want that Nick.

2279
02:13:02,225 --> 02:13:03,518
I'm leaving.

2280
02:13:03,685 --> 02:13:06,313
You really think that's smart?

2281
02:13:06,980 --> 02:13:07,980
Shampoo.

2282
02:13:10,692 --> 02:13:14,488
Wounded, raped wife battles her way
back to her husband...

2283
02:13:14,654 --> 02:13:16,406
and he deserts her.

2284
02:13:16,573 --> 02:13:17,616
They'll destroy you.

2285
02:13:18,366 --> 02:13:19,743
Neighbors will shun you.

2286
02:13:19,910 --> 02:13:24,122
And I'll make sure that no one forgets
the pain you caused me.

2287
02:13:26,208 --> 02:13:31,296
I don't want anything to do
with your groupies outside.

2288
02:13:31,880 --> 02:13:33,507
Once they go...

2289
02:13:34,382 --> 02:13:35,175
I go.

2290
02:13:35,342 --> 02:13:38,762
Give it the night. Sleep on it.

2291
02:13:55,612 --> 02:13:57,197
Was there ever a baby?

2292
02:13:57,489 --> 02:13:59,574
There can be.

2293
02:14:03,578 --> 02:14:04,579
Good night.

2294
02:14:57,507 --> 02:14:59,175
Hey. Nick!

2295
02:15:11,313 --> 02:15:12,564
Hello, handsome.

2296
02:15:15,692 --> 02:15:17,444
Crepe?

2297
02:15:18,153 --> 02:15:18,945
Sure.

2298
02:15:19,112 --> 02:15:20,697
She was his dream girl.

2299
02:15:20,864 --> 02:15:24,159
And when this spoiled, rich,
entitled little boy couldn't have her...

2300
02:15:24,326 --> 02:15:25,702
he took her.

2301
02:15:33,084 --> 02:15:34,419
You must be so proud.

2302
02:15:41,676 --> 02:15:43,678
It's been four hours.

2303
02:15:44,179 --> 02:15:47,015
Nick? Nick? What's next for you and Amy?

2304
02:15:51,186 --> 02:15:54,022
Right now, it's all about our marriage.

2305
02:15:54,856 --> 02:15:58,234
When two people love each other
and can't make that work...

2306
02:15:58,401 --> 02:16:00,820
that's the real tragedy.

2307
02:16:04,574 --> 02:16:06,618
Kiss my cheek.

2308
02:16:12,957 --> 02:16:15,710
I can't believe that fucking spider
is America's sweetheart.

2309
02:16:15,794 --> 02:16:17,879
She told me she killed Desi.

2310
02:16:18,046 --> 02:16:19,255
Not self-defense. Murder.

2311
02:16:19,422 --> 02:16:20,840
- Can't we get a wire?
- That's not gonna work.

2312
02:16:21,007 --> 02:16:22,050
She told you once before.

2313
02:16:22,217 --> 02:16:24,427
Yeah, because she had me strip naked,
and stand in the shower.

2314
02:16:24,594 --> 02:16:27,722
I swear, you two are the most
fucked-up people I've ever known.

2315
02:16:27,889 --> 02:16:29,349
And I specialize in fucked-up.

2316
02:16:29,599 --> 02:16:31,309
You and Amy under the same roof?

2317
02:16:31,476 --> 02:16:33,269
You should pitch that
as reality television.

2318
02:16:33,895 --> 02:16:36,147
Amy Dunne,
and the Miracle on the Mississippi.

2319
02:16:36,314 --> 02:16:38,692
Nick and I have been through
some bad patches.

2320
02:16:38,858 --> 02:16:40,068
We've had our dark days.

2321
02:16:40,235 --> 02:16:42,070
But we thank you so much...

2322
02:16:42,570 --> 02:16:47,117
for supporting us in our new life together,
for forgiving Nick.

2323
02:16:47,367 --> 02:16:50,954
Really, your encouragement
means the world.

2324
02:16:51,121 --> 02:16:52,414
She's good.

2325
02:16:52,580 --> 02:16:55,041
Amazing Amy and the Humbled Husband.

2326
02:16:55,208 --> 02:16:57,168
The Real Housewives of Branson.

2327
02:16:57,335 --> 02:16:58,294
Take care of this guy, will you?

2328
02:16:58,461 --> 02:17:00,061
I can't believe you're just leaving now.

2329
02:17:00,088 --> 02:17:01,506
You are not at risk anymore.

2330
02:17:01,673 --> 02:17:03,049
I'm the definition of "at risk. "

2331
02:17:03,258 --> 02:17:07,262
You got a book deal, a Lifetime movie,
you franchised The Bar.

2332
02:17:07,429 --> 02:17:08,471
You may wanna thank her.

2333
02:17:11,516 --> 02:17:12,934
Just don't piss her off.

2334
02:17:13,768 --> 02:17:14,768
See you, guys-

2335
02:17:16,896 --> 02:17:18,440
Elvis has left Missouri.

2336
02:17:18,606 --> 02:17:19,566
She had to have made a mistake.

2337
02:17:19,733 --> 02:17:21,901
We need to check Amy's story,
piece by piece.

2338
02:17:22,068 --> 02:17:23,945
Nick, I can't do anything.

2339
02:17:24,362 --> 02:17:27,073
We had the national spotlight on us,
we stained the rug.

2340
02:17:27,240 --> 02:17:28,960
The case is with the Feds now,
they're done.

2341
02:17:28,992 --> 02:17:30,034
That doesn't mean you have to be done.

2342
02:17:30,452 --> 02:17:32,245
It does.

2343
02:18:03,818 --> 02:18:05,278
What are you doing?

2344
02:18:07,197 --> 02:18:08,656
Couldn't sleep.

2345
02:18:08,823 --> 02:18:09,823
Come on...

2346
02:18:10,116 --> 02:18:12,285
let me tuck you back in.

2347
02:18:24,964 --> 02:18:27,592
You know you can sleep with me, right?

2348
02:18:29,677 --> 02:18:31,638
Yeah, it's just...

2349
02:18:31,805 --> 02:18:33,139
I need more time.

2350
02:18:33,348 --> 02:18:36,893
I would never, ever hurt you.

2351
02:18:38,686 --> 02:18:41,022
I do need you to participate, though.

2352
02:18:41,189 --> 02:18:43,358
I need you to do your part.

2353
02:18:53,660 --> 02:18:54,660
Okay.

2354
02:18:55,411 --> 02:18:58,206
Everything you have heard
about my wife...

2355
02:18:58,289 --> 02:18:59,541
is a lie.

2356
02:18:59,707 --> 02:19:03,795
She is a calculating,
murderous psychopath.

2357
02:19:04,420 --> 02:19:05,839
And I have been complicit...

2358
02:19:06,005 --> 02:19:07,131
Nick!

2359
02:19:12,804 --> 02:19:14,848
Nick? Breakfast.

2360
02:19:15,014 --> 02:19:16,014
Honey?

2361
02:19:19,561 --> 02:19:21,896
We should hold hands.

2362
02:19:22,063 --> 02:19:25,149
Not the entire time,
but on and off throughout.

2363
02:19:26,568 --> 02:19:28,778
"So, Nick, how does it feel
to have your wife back?"

2364
02:19:31,406 --> 02:19:33,157
"It's fantastic. "

2365
02:19:33,324 --> 02:19:36,244
"How many people are lucky enough
to get a second chance at love?"

2366
02:19:36,411 --> 02:19:38,121
"Fantastic" is a little flippant.

2367
02:19:38,538 --> 02:19:39,539
"Amazing"?

2368
02:19:39,706 --> 02:19:42,417
I need you
to admit that you got the credit cards...

2369
02:19:42,584 --> 02:19:45,587
and that you hid all that stuff at Go's
and that you pushed me.

2370
02:19:46,337 --> 02:19:49,382
I'm gonna need
those three things to feel safe.

2371
02:19:50,592 --> 02:19:52,427
You have to own this, Nick.

2372
02:19:53,219 --> 02:19:56,764
Don't worry. I know exactly what to say.

2373
02:19:58,349 --> 02:20:00,101
Nick.

2374
02:20:03,062 --> 02:20:05,690
What a beautiful home.

2375
02:20:06,941 --> 02:20:09,485
I so appreciate
you giving us this time, Nick.

2376
02:20:09,652 --> 02:20:11,696
You went on national television...

2377
02:20:11,863 --> 02:20:14,198
and told people that I murdered my wife.

2378
02:20:14,365 --> 02:20:15,491
I go where the story goes.

2379
02:20:15,658 --> 02:20:18,494
You implied that I had carnal relations
with my sister.

2380
02:20:18,661 --> 02:20:22,081
I didn't use the "I" word.
I said you two were "extremely close. "

2381
02:20:22,248 --> 02:20:26,920
You and a panel of nitwits
diagnosed me as a sociopath.

2382
02:20:28,129 --> 02:20:29,881
Ice-breaker.

2383
02:20:33,593 --> 02:20:35,261
To go with your robot dog.

2384
02:20:35,428 --> 02:20:37,472
I'll go find Amy.

2385
02:20:39,515 --> 02:20:41,601
She's downstairs.

2386
02:20:44,103 --> 02:20:45,605
- What is it?
- It's for you.

2387
02:20:45,772 --> 02:20:47,190
Open it.

2388
02:20:47,482 --> 02:20:49,108
I don't need any more gifts from you.

2389
02:20:49,275 --> 02:20:50,985
Open it.

2390
02:21:03,539 --> 02:21:05,083
I didn't touch you.

2391
02:21:05,249 --> 02:21:06,249
You didn't need to.

2392
02:21:06,334 --> 02:21:09,420
Bullshit. That notice of disposal.

2393
02:21:09,587 --> 02:21:10,964
I have that. You threw it out.

2394
02:21:11,130 --> 02:21:12,966
The notice, yes.

2395
02:21:13,341 --> 02:21:14,341
I want a blood test.

2396
02:21:14,759 --> 02:21:15,843
I want a paternity test.

2397
02:21:16,636 --> 02:21:17,845
I love tests.

2398
02:21:18,012 --> 02:21:19,722
You can teach those people
to hate me all you want.

2399
02:21:19,889 --> 02:21:22,600
I don't care. I am leaving you.

2400
02:21:24,727 --> 02:21:27,313
I won't have to teach your child
to hate you.

2401
02:21:27,480 --> 02:21:29,732
He'll do that all by himself.

2402
02:21:29,899 --> 02:21:31,776
You fucking cunt!

2403
02:21:33,653 --> 02:21:35,905
I'm the cunt you married.

2404
02:21:36,072 --> 02:21:37,740
The only time you liked yourself...

2405
02:21:37,907 --> 02:21:41,452
was when you were trying to be someone
this cunt might like.

2406
02:21:41,619 --> 02:21:45,081
I'm not a quitter. I'm that cunt.

2407
02:21:48,835 --> 02:21:52,088
I've killed for you.
Who else can say that?

2408
02:21:53,339 --> 02:21:55,758
You think you would be happy
with a nice Midwestern girl?

2409
02:21:55,925 --> 02:21:58,636
No way, baby. I'm it.

2410
02:21:58,803 --> 02:22:02,098
Look, you're delusional. You're insane.

2411
02:22:02,265 --> 02:22:03,766
Why would you even want this?

2412
02:22:04,142 --> 02:22:05,142
Yes, I loved you.

2413
02:22:05,268 --> 02:22:08,604
And then all we did was resent each other,
and try to control each other.

2414
02:22:08,771 --> 02:22:09,811
And cause each other pain.

2415
02:22:10,314 --> 02:22:12,108
That's marriage.

2416
02:22:14,777 --> 02:22:17,155
Now, I'm getting ready.

2417
02:22:42,472 --> 02:22:45,433
I can't watch you play house
with that thing for the next 18 years.

2418
02:22:45,600 --> 02:22:47,143
I can't just walk away.

2419
02:22:47,310 --> 02:22:48,770
You could get custody.

2420
02:22:48,936 --> 02:22:52,690
No, I won't. And you know it.

2421
02:22:52,857 --> 02:22:55,359
It's gonna be my child.
I'm not gonna leave it.

2422
02:22:55,985 --> 02:22:57,653
You wanna stay.

2423
02:22:57,820 --> 02:23:01,616
I have a responsibility.
It's not about what I want anymore.

2424
02:23:01,783 --> 02:23:03,034
You wanna stay with her.

2425
02:23:13,669 --> 02:23:14,712
You're breaking my heart.

2426
02:23:15,171 --> 02:23:18,674
Go, you're my voice of reason.

2427
02:23:18,841 --> 02:23:21,219
I need you with me on this.

2428
02:23:21,385 --> 02:23:23,846
Of course I'm with you.

2429
02:23:26,474 --> 02:23:30,478
I was with you before we were even born.

2430
02:23:32,230 --> 02:23:35,024
We've been through the darkness.

2431
02:23:35,566 --> 02:23:38,861
We've come out, united.

2432
02:23:41,864 --> 02:23:44,033
We communicate.

2433
02:23:46,327 --> 02:23:48,704
We're honest with each other.

2434
02:23:48,871 --> 02:23:50,373
Right?

2435
02:23:52,291 --> 02:23:54,794
We're partners in crime.

2436
02:23:58,172 --> 02:23:59,172
And?

2437
02:24:00,883 --> 02:24:02,218
And?

2438
02:24:05,721 --> 02:24:07,640
We're gonna be parents.

2439
02:24:09,350 --> 02:24:10,977
My goodness!

2440
02:24:11,394 --> 02:24:13,354
- How exciting!
- Thank you.

2441
02:24:18,151 --> 02:24:20,528
"What are you thinking?"

2442
02:24:23,364 --> 02:24:25,575
"How are you feeling?"

2443
02:24:27,535 --> 02:24:30,163
"What have we done to each other?"

2444
02:24:31,747 --> 02:24:33,833
"What Will we do?"
