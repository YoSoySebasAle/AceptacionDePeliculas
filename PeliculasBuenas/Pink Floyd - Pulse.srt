1
00:07:13,786 --> 00:07:15,727
SHINE ON YOU CRAZY DIAMOND

2
00:07:18,951 --> 00:07:22,532
Remember when you were young?

3
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:27,070
You shone like the sun.

4
00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:35,240
Shine on, you crazy diamond

5
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:42,501
Now there's a look in your eyes

6
00:07:43,728 --> 00:07:47,457
Like black holes in the sky

7
00:07:47,832 --> 00:07:54,764
Shine on, you crazy diamond

8
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,112
You were caught in the crossfire

9
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,387
Of childhood and stardom,

10
00:08:02,422 --> 00:08:07,211
Blown on the steel breeze

11
00:08:07,246 --> 00:08:09,811
Come on you target

12
00:08:09,846 --> 00:08:12,469
for faraway laughter;

13
00:08:12,504 --> 00:08:15,924
Come on you stranger, you legend,

14
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:20,072
You martyr, and shine

15
00:08:36,907 --> 00:08:41,088
You reached for the secret too soon

16
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,891
You cried for the moon

17
00:08:47,107 --> 00:08:53,780
Shine on, you crazy diamond

18
00:08:56,817 --> 00:09:00,313
Threatened by shadows at night

19
00:09:02,669 --> 00:09:05,555
And exposed in the light

20
00:09:06,717 --> 00:09:13,012
Shine on, you crazy diamond

21
00:09:15,678 --> 00:09:18,849
Well, you wore out your welcome

22
00:09:18,884 --> 00:09:21,217
With random precision

23
00:09:21,252 --> 00:09:25,835
Rode on the steel breeze

24
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:31,223
Come on you raver, you seer of visions,

25
00:09:31,258 --> 00:09:34,830
Come on you painter, you piper,

26
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:38,976
You prisioner, and shine

27
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:37,133
Nobody knows where you are,

28
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:42,695
How near or how far

29
00:11:43,251 --> 00:11:49,776
Shine on, you crazy diamond

30
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:56,901
Pile on many more layers

31
00:11:58,787 --> 00:12:01,898
And I'll be joining you there

32
00:12:03,065 --> 00:12:09,494
Shine on, you crazy diamond

33
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:15,176
And we'll bask in the shadow

34
00:12:15,211 --> 00:12:17,742
Of yesterday's triumph

35
00:12:17,777 --> 00:12:22,083
And sail on the steel breeze

36
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:27,523
Come on you boy child,you winner and loser,

37
00:12:27,626 --> 00:12:32,329
Come on you miner for?truth and delusion,

38
00:12:32,364 --> 00:12:35,251
And shine

39
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:30,500
LEARNING TO FLY

40
00:13:47,595 --> 00:13:51,803
Into the distance a ribbon of black

41
00:13:52,802 --> 00:13:57,595
Stretched to the point of no turning back

42
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:03,272
A flight of fancy on a windswept field

43
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:08,970
Standing alone my senses real

44
00:14:09,937 --> 00:14:14,486
A fatal attraction is holding me fast

45
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:20,270
How can I escape this irresistible grasp?

46
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:25,762
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies

47
00:14:26,494 --> 00:14:32,944
Tongue tied and twisted Just an earth bound misfit I

48
00:14:43,893 --> 00:14:48,442
Ice is forming on the tips of my wings

49
00:14:49,448 --> 00:14:54,900
Unheeded warnings I thought I thought of everything

50
00:14:55,146 --> 00:14:59,543
No navigator to find my way home

51
00:15:00,475 --> 00:15:05,645
Unladened, empty and turned to stone

52
00:15:06,546 --> 00:15:10,928
A soul in tension that's learning to fly

53
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:16,641
Condition grounded but determined to try

54
00:15:17,857 --> 00:15:22,478
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies

55
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:29,514
Tongue tied and twisted just an earth bound misfit, I

56
00:16:26,017 --> 00:16:30,017
Above the planet on a wing and a prayer,

57
00:16:31,229 --> 00:16:36,724
My grubby halo, a vapour trail in the empty air.

58
00:16:37,285 --> 00:16:41,722
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly

59
00:16:42,423 --> 00:16:46,962
Out of the corner of my watering eye

60
00:16:48,102 --> 00:16:52,560
A dream unthreatened by the morning light

61
00:16:53,565 --> 00:16:58,106
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

62
00:16:59,366 --> 00:17:04,140
There's no sensation to compare with this

63
00:17:04,771 --> 00:17:09,752
Suspended animation, A state of bliss

64
00:17:10,518 --> 00:17:15,704
Can't keep my mind from the circling skies

65
00:17:15,972 --> 00:17:22,459
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I

66
00:19:04,994 --> 00:19:10,615
HIGH HOPES

67
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:03,627
Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young

68
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:08,304
In a world of magnets and miracles

69
00:20:10,171 --> 00:20:14,963
our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary

70
00:20:15,773 --> 00:20:20,896
The ringing of the division bell had began

71
00:20:22,563 --> 00:20:28,609
Along the long road and on down the causeway

72
00:20:29,225 --> 00:20:33,489
Do they still meet there by the cut?

73
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,971
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps

74
00:20:41,662 --> 00:20:46,104
Running before time took our dreams away

75
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:54,647
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground

76
00:20:54,698 --> 00:20:59,295
To a life consumed by slow decay

77
00:21:00,194 --> 00:21:02,770
The grass was greener

78
00:21:05,728 --> 00:21:08,760
The light was brighter

79
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,351
With friends surrounded

80
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:21,639
The nights of wonder

81
00:21:27,278 --> 00:21:32,466
Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us

82
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:38,017
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side

83
00:21:39,355 --> 00:21:44,895
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again

84
00:21:46,187 --> 00:21:50,524
Dragged by the force of some inner tide

85
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:57,139
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled

86
00:21:59,101 --> 00:22:04,167
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

87
00:23:09,226 --> 00:23:14,139
Encumbered forever by desire and ambition

88
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,931
There's a hunger still unsatisfied

89
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:26,936
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon

90
00:23:27,671 --> 00:23:32,828
Though down this road we've been so many times

91
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:36,683
The grass was greener

92
00:23:39,829 --> 00:23:42,550
The light was brighter

93
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:49,272
The taste was sweeter

94
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:55,263
The nights of wonder

95
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:01,986
With friends surrounded

96
00:24:04,981 --> 00:24:08,031
The dawn mist glowing

97
00:24:11,531 --> 00:24:14,498
The water flowing

98
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:20,506
The endless river

99
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:27,729
Forever and ever

100
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:20,622
TAKE IT BACK

101
00:28:23,863 --> 00:28:27,302
Her love rains down on me

102
00:28:27,387 --> 00:28:30,828
easy as the breeze

103
00:28:31,538 --> 00:28:35,394
I listen to her breathing

104
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:39,331
it sounds like the waves on the sea

105
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:43,612
I was thinking all about her,

106
00:28:43,613 --> 00:28:47,590
burning with rage and desire

107
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:51,339
We were spinning into darkness,

108
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,313
and the earth was on fire

109
00:28:55,327 --> 00:28:59,788
She could take it back,

110
00:28:59,834 --> 00:29:05,261
she might take it back some day

111
00:29:12,046 --> 00:29:16,488
So I spy on her, I  lied to her,

112
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:19,297
I make promises I cannot keep

113
00:29:20,688 --> 00:29:24,663
Then I hear her laughter rising,

114
00:29:24,664 --> 00:29:27,905
rising from the deep

115
00:29:28,887 --> 00:29:32,805
And I make her prove her love for me,

116
00:29:32,806 --> 00:29:36,063
I take all that I can take

117
00:29:36,755 --> 00:29:40,222
And I push her to the limit

118
00:29:40,766 --> 00:29:44,467
to see if she will break

119
00:29:44,502 --> 00:29:49,042
She might take it back,

120
00:29:49,107 --> 00:29:54,244
she could take it back some day

121
00:31:11,527 --> 00:31:15,378
Now I had seen the warnings,

122
00:31:15,379 --> 00:31:19,011
screaming from all sides

123
00:31:19,817 --> 00:31:23,746
It's easy to ignore them

124
00:31:23,821 --> 00:31:26,867
God knows I've tried

125
00:31:27,998 --> 00:31:31,850
All of this temptation,

126
00:31:31,914 --> 00:31:35,493
you know it turned my faith to lies

127
00:31:35,552 --> 00:31:39,988
Until I couldn't see the danger

128
00:31:39,989 --> 00:31:43,944
or hear the rising tide

129
00:31:44,063 --> 00:31:48,002
She Can take it back,

130
00:31:48,066 --> 00:31:53,329
she Will take it back some day

131
00:32:00,098 --> 00:32:04,254
She can take it back,

132
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:09,668
she will take it back some day

133
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:20,595
She will take it back,

134
00:32:20,681 --> 00:32:26,601
She will take it back some day

135
00:33:15,664 --> 00:33:20,760
COMING BACK TO LIFE

136
00:35:14,114 --> 00:35:17,886
Where were you

137
00:35:20,461 --> 00:35:24,690
when I was burned and broken

138
00:35:28,475 --> 00:35:31,507
While the days slipped by

139
00:35:32,147 --> 00:35:36,435
from my window watching

140
00:35:40,198 --> 00:35:45,417
And Where were you?

141
00:35:46,865 --> 00:35:51,807
when I was hurt and I was helpless

142
00:35:53,907 --> 00:35:56,904
Because the things you say

143
00:35:57,439 --> 00:36:02,062
and the things you do surround me

144
00:36:05,338 --> 00:36:08,775
While you were hanging yourself

145
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,877
on someone else's words

146
00:36:12,231 --> 00:36:17,098
dying to believe in what you heard

147
00:36:17,653 --> 00:36:20,526
I was staring straight

148
00:36:21,427 --> 00:36:25,134
into the shining sun

149
00:36:34,698 --> 00:36:42,266
Lost in thought and lost in time

150
00:36:45,241 --> 00:36:52,302
While the seeds of life and the seeds of change were planted

151
00:36:55,614 --> 00:37:03,683
Outside the rain fell dark and slow

152
00:37:06,497 --> 00:37:13,571
While I pondered on this dangerous but irresistible past-time

153
00:37:17,169 --> 00:37:21,831
I took a heavenly ride through our silence

154
00:37:22,716 --> 00:37:27,282
I knew the moment had arrived

155
00:37:28,339 --> 00:37:34,837
For killing the past and coming back to life

156
00:38:22,241 --> 00:38:26,818
I took a heavenly ride trough our silence

157
00:38:27,565 --> 00:38:32,170
I knew the waiting had begun

158
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:40,666
And headed straight... into the shining sun

159
00:40:05,868 --> 00:40:10,276
SORROW

160
00:43:23,285 --> 00:43:26,861
The sweet smell of a great sorrow lies over the land

161
00:43:27,461 --> 00:43:32,810
Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky.

162
00:43:32,895 --> 00:43:37,372
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers,

163
00:43:37,407 --> 00:43:42,705
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking

164
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:52,653
He's haunted by the memory of a lost paradise

165
00:43:52,693 --> 00:43:57,747
In his youth or a dream,he can't be precise

166
00:43:57,782 --> 00:44:02,819
He's chained forever to a world that's departed

167
00:44:02,854 --> 00:44:06,457
It's not enough, it's not enough

168
00:44:32,905 --> 00:44:38,138
His blood has frozen and curdled with fright

169
00:44:38,234 --> 00:44:42,620
His knees have trembled and given way in the night

170
00:44:42,655 --> 00:44:48,188
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth

171
00:44:48,274 --> 00:44:51,175
His step has faltered

172
00:44:58,746 --> 00:45:02,693
One world,

173
00:45:03,582 --> 00:45:08,165
One soul

174
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:12,939
Time pass,

175
00:45:13,465 --> 00:45:18,308
The river rolls

176
00:46:19,323 --> 00:46:24,395
And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication

177
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:29,298
And silent replies that swirl invitation

178
00:46:29,443 --> 00:46:34,500
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea

179
00:46:34,621 --> 00:46:38,878
A grim intimation of what is to be

180
00:46:44,516 --> 00:46:49,603
There's an unceasing wind that blows through this night

181
00:46:49,712 --> 00:46:54,620
And there's dust in my eyes, that blinds my sight

182
00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:59,668
And silence that speaks so much louder that words,

183
00:46:59,777 --> 00:47:03,045
Of promises broken.

184
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,247
KEEP TALKING

185
00:52:32,403 --> 00:52:38,478
For millions of years mankind lived just like the animals

186
00:52:42,224 --> 00:52:44,246
Then something happenend

187
00:52:44,295 --> 00:52:47,431
which unleashed the power of our imagination

188
00:52:47,541 --> 00:52:49,737
We learned to talk

189
00:52:49,853 --> 00:52:53,827
There's a silence surrounding me

190
00:52:54,703 --> 00:52:58,464
I can't seem to think straight

191
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,750
I'll sit in the corner

192
00:53:04,157 --> 00:53:08,148
No one will bother me

193
00:53:08,883 --> 00:53:14,196
I think I should speak now  (Why won't you talk to me?)

194
00:53:14,231 --> 00:53:18,964
I can't seem to speak now (You never talk to me)

195
00:53:18,999 --> 00:53:23,497
My words won't come out right (What are you thinking?)

196
00:53:23,532 --> 00:53:28,640
I feel like I'm drowning  (What are you feeling?)

197
00:53:28,675 --> 00:53:33,413
I'm feeling weak now (Why won't you talk to me?)

198
00:53:33,448 --> 00:53:38,247
But I can't show my weakness (You never talk to me)

199
00:53:38,282 --> 00:53:42,882
I sometimes wonder (What are you thinking?)

200
00:53:42,917 --> 00:53:48,981
Where do we go from here (What are you feeling?)

201
00:53:57,390 --> 00:54:00,552
It doesn't have to be like this

202
00:54:01,172 --> 00:54:07,426
All we need to do is make sure we keep talking

203
00:55:23,884 --> 00:55:28,745
(Why won't you talk to me?) I feel like I'm drowning

204
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:33,794
(You never talk to me) You know I can't breathe now

205
00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:38,300
(What are you thinking?) We're going nowhere

206
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:43,243
(What are you feeling?) We're going nowhere

207
00:55:43,278 --> 00:55:45,694
Why won't you talk to me?

208
00:55:48,139 --> 00:55:51,601
You never talk to me

209
00:55:52,741 --> 00:55:56,031
What are you thinking?

210
00:55:59,818 --> 00:56:04,261
Where do we go from here?

211
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:15,128
It doesn't have to be like this

212
00:56:32,601 --> 00:56:35,798
All we need to do

213
00:56:35,949 --> 00:56:41,275
is make sure we keep talking

214
00:58:51,896 --> 00:58:57,114
ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL PART 2

215
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:38,112
We don't need no education

216
01:00:42,332 --> 01:00:47,121
We dont need no thought control

217
01:00:51,488 --> 01:00:56,676
No dark sarcasm in the classroom

218
01:01:01,272 --> 01:01:05,894
Teachers leave them kids alone

219
01:01:12,107 --> 01:01:16,557
Hey! Teachers! Leave them kids alone!

220
01:01:20,715 --> 01:01:25,966
All in all it's just another brick in the wall.

221
01:01:29,622 --> 01:01:35,370
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.

222
01:01:39,032 --> 01:01:43,654
We don't need no education

223
01:01:48,332 --> 01:01:52,970
We dont need no thought control

224
01:01:57,482 --> 01:02:02,504
No dark sarcasm in the classroom

225
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:11,564
Teachers leave them kids alone

226
01:02:17,935 --> 01:02:22,529
Hey! Teacher! Leave them kids alone!

227
01:02:26,646 --> 01:02:31,779
All in all it's just another brick in the wall.

228
01:02:36,116 --> 01:02:41,199
All in all you're just another brick in the wall.

229
01:05:45,871 --> 01:05:52,082
ONE OF THESE DAYS

230
01:09:36,913 --> 01:09:38,910
One of these days

231
01:09:38,996 --> 01:09:43,152
I'm going to cut you into little pieces.

232
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:21,000
SPEAK TO ME

233
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:36,710
"I've been mad for fucking years, absolutely years, I've been over the edge for yonks, been working me buns off for bands, for ages..."

234
01:13:55,390 --> 01:14:03,530
"I've been mad for fucking years, absolutely years, I've been over the edge for yonks, been working me buns off for bands, for ages..."

235
01:14:03,860 --> 01:14:11,900
"I've always been mad, I know I've been mad, like the most of us have...very hard to explain why you're mad, even if you're not mad..."

236
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:37,770
"I've always been mad, I know I've been mad, like the most of us have...very hard to explain why you're mad, even if you're not mad..."

237
01:15:33,114 --> 01:15:38,176
BREATHE

238
01:16:02,043 --> 01:16:06,193
Breathe, breathe in the air.

239
01:16:10,163 --> 01:16:14,193
Don't be afraid to care.

240
01:16:17,373 --> 01:16:21,603
Leave but don't leave me.

241
01:16:23,703 --> 01:16:29,323
Look around and choose your own ground.

242
01:16:31,133 --> 01:16:34,843
Long you live and high you fly

243
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:38,883
And smiles you'll give and tears you'll cry

244
01:16:38,983 --> 01:16:42,553
And all you touch and all you see

245
01:16:42,653 --> 01:16:46,713
Is all your life will ever be.

246
01:16:47,563 --> 01:16:51,983
Run, rabbit run.

247
01:16:54,233 --> 01:16:59,583
Dig that hole,forget the sun,

248
01:17:02,173 --> 01:17:07,033
And when at last the work is done.

249
01:17:09,153 --> 01:17:14,183
Don't sit down it's time to dig another one.

250
01:17:16,343 --> 01:17:20,003
For long you live and high you fly

251
01:17:20,113 --> 01:17:23,913
But only if you ride the tide

252
01:17:24,003 --> 01:17:27,503
And balanced on the biggest wave

253
01:17:27,593 --> 01:17:31,913
You race towards an early grave.

254
01:21:23,083 --> 01:21:28,113
TIME

255
01:23:28,383 --> 01:23:33,633
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day

256
01:23:35,503 --> 01:23:40,273
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way.

257
01:23:42,393 --> 01:23:47,393
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town

258
01:23:49,443 --> 01:23:54,323
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.

259
01:23:56,423 --> 01:24:03,543
Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain.

260
01:24:03,833 --> 01:24:10,783
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today.

261
01:24:11,793 --> 01:24:15,283
And then one day you find

262
01:24:15,343 --> 01:24:18,673
Ten years have got behind you.

263
01:24:18,733 --> 01:24:22,373
No one told you when to run,

264
01:24:23,083 --> 01:24:26,053
You missed the starting gun.

265
01:25:49,933 --> 01:25:55,023
And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking

266
01:25:57,123 --> 01:26:01,843
And racing around to come up behind you again.

267
01:26:04,103 --> 01:26:08,863
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older,

268
01:26:11,203 --> 01:26:15,463
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.

269
01:26:18,163 --> 01:26:24,823
Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time.

270
01:26:25,263 --> 01:26:28,833
Plans that either come to naught

271
01:26:28,923 --> 01:26:32,283
or half a page of scribbled lines

272
01:26:32,693 --> 01:26:39,843
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way

273
01:26:39,933 --> 01:26:43,803
The time has gone, the song is over,

274
01:26:43,883 --> 01:26:48,383
Thought I'd something more to say...

275
01:27:04,073 --> 01:27:08,233
Home, home again

276
01:27:11,353 --> 01:27:16,323
I like to be here when I can

277
01:27:18,803 --> 01:27:23,413
When I come home cold and tired

278
01:27:25,823 --> 01:27:30,813
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire.

279
01:27:33,643 --> 01:27:40,683
Far away across the field The tolling of the iron bell

280
01:27:41,113 --> 01:27:45,083
Calls the faithful to their knees

281
01:27:45,113 --> 01:27:51,793
To hear the softly spoken magic spells...

282
01:28:00,963 --> 01:28:06,643
THE GREAT GIG IN THE SKY

283
01:28:37,363 --> 01:28:39,613
"And I am not frightened of dying,

284
01:28:39,703 --> 01:28:42,703
any time will do, I don't mind.

285
01:28:45,053 --> 01:28:48,243
Why should I be frightened of dying

286
01:28:48,283 --> 01:28:51,333
There's no reason for it, you've gotta go sometime."

287
01:33:18,683 --> 01:33:23,743
MONEY

288
01:34:02,053 --> 01:34:06,463
Money, get away.

289
01:34:08,243 --> 01:34:13,243
Get a good job with more pay and you're okay.

290
01:34:15,613 --> 01:34:20,053
Money, it's a gas.

291
01:34:21,843 --> 01:34:26,883
Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash.

292
01:34:28,993 --> 01:34:32,593
New car, caviar, four star daydream,

293
01:34:32,633 --> 01:34:37,383
Think I'll buy me a football team.

294
01:34:42,283 --> 01:34:46,283
Money, get back.

295
01:34:48,483 --> 01:34:53,433
I'm all right Jack keep your hands off of my stack.

296
01:34:55,633 --> 01:34:59,823
Money, it's a hit.

297
01:35:01,603 --> 01:35:06,853
Don't give me that do goody good bullshit.

298
01:35:07,783 --> 01:35:12,723
I'm in the high-fidelity first class travelling set

299
01:35:12,753 --> 01:35:17,353
And I think I need a Lear jet.

300
01:40:47,183 --> 01:40:51,643
Money, it's a crime.

301
01:40:53,243 --> 01:40:58,243
Share it fairly but don't take a slice of my pie.

302
01:41:00,033 --> 01:41:04,423
Money, so they say

303
01:41:06,143 --> 01:41:11,093
Is the root of all evil today.

304
01:41:13,033 --> 01:41:18,673
But if you ask for a raise it's no surprise that

305
01:41:18,773 --> 01:41:21,813
they're giving none away.

306
01:42:01,813 --> 01:42:05,883
US AND THEM

307
01:43:25,423 --> 01:43:28,013
Us,

308
01:43:30,933 --> 01:43:33,143
and them

309
01:43:39,213 --> 01:43:46,143
And after all we're only ordinary men.

310
01:43:57,153 --> 01:43:59,773
Me,

311
01:44:02,143 --> 01:44:04,553
and you.

312
01:44:10,293 --> 01:44:15,163
God only knows it's not what

313
01:44:15,253 --> 01:44:18,993
we would choose to do.

314
01:44:27,353 --> 01:44:31,483
Forward he cried from the rear

315
01:44:31,553 --> 01:44:35,643
and the front rank died.

316
01:44:39,533 --> 01:44:45,433
And the general sat and the lines on the map

317
01:44:45,513 --> 01:44:50,403
moved from side to side.

318
01:44:51,943 --> 01:44:54,863
Black

319
01:44:57,323 --> 01:44:59,693
and blue

320
01:45:05,873 --> 01:45:08,933
And who knows which is which

321
01:45:10,043 --> 01:45:13,223
and who is who.

322
01:45:22,853 --> 01:45:24,983
Up

323
01:45:28,493 --> 01:45:31,383
and down.

324
01:45:36,473 --> 01:45:41,243
And in the end it's only

325
01:45:41,313 --> 01:45:45,853
round and round... and round

326
01:45:53,253 --> 01:45:58,963
Haven't you heard it's a battle of words

327
01:45:59,073 --> 01:46:03,333
The poster bearer cried.

328
01:46:05,463 --> 01:46:10,813
Listen son, said the man with the gun

329
01:46:11,653 --> 01:46:16,083
There's room for you inside.

330
01:47:42,923 --> 01:47:45,523
Down

331
01:47:47,933 --> 01:47:50,613
and out

332
01:47:56,193 --> 01:47:59,233
It can't be helped

333
01:47:59,313 --> 01:48:03,833
but there's a lot of it about.

334
01:48:12,933 --> 01:48:15,443
With,

335
01:48:18,523 --> 01:48:21,513
without.

336
01:48:26,623 --> 01:48:29,623
And who'll deny

337
01:48:29,733 --> 01:48:34,033
it's what the fighting's all about

338
01:48:43,433 --> 01:48:48,773
Out of the way, it's a busy day

339
01:48:49,583 --> 01:48:53,443
I've got things on my mind.

340
01:48:55,403 --> 01:49:00,773
For want of the price of a tea and a slice

341
01:49:00,923 --> 01:49:06,553
The old man died.

342
01:52:23,633 --> 01:52:28,533
BRAIN DAMAGE

343
01:52:39,453 --> 01:52:43,263
The lunatic is on the grass.

344
01:52:46,383 --> 01:52:50,593
The lunatic is on the grass.

345
01:52:53,453 --> 01:52:59,443
Remembering games and daisy chains and laughs.

346
01:53:00,383 --> 01:53:04,893
Got to keep the loonies on the path.

347
01:53:08,063 --> 01:53:12,183
The lunatic is in the hall.

348
01:53:15,183 --> 01:53:19,463
The lunatics are in my hall.

349
01:53:22,473 --> 01:53:28,093
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor

350
01:53:29,153 --> 01:53:33,963
And every day the paper boy brings more.

351
01:53:40,723 --> 01:53:46,313
And if the dam breaks open many years too soon

352
01:53:47,213 --> 01:53:51,543
And if there is no room upon the hill

353
01:53:54,533 --> 01:54:00,363
And if your head explodes with dark forebodings too

354
01:54:01,153 --> 01:54:05,783
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.

355
01:54:12,263 --> 01:54:16,543
The lunatic is in my head.

356
01:54:19,583 --> 01:54:23,653
The lunatic is in my head

357
01:54:27,083 --> 01:54:32,973
You raise the blade, you make the change

358
01:54:34,043 --> 01:54:38,243
You re-arrange me 'till I'm sane.

359
01:54:41,043 --> 01:54:43,423
You lock the door

360
01:54:44,673 --> 01:54:47,213
And throw away the key

361
01:54:47,813 --> 01:54:52,823
There's someone in my head but it's not me.

362
01:54:59,043 --> 01:55:04,893
And if the cloud bursts,thunder in your ear

363
01:55:06,223 --> 01:55:10,163
You shout and no one seems to hear.

364
01:55:13,163 --> 01:55:19,003
And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes

365
01:55:19,953 --> 01:55:24,203
I'll see you on the dark side of the moon.

366
01:56:11,663 --> 01:56:16,333
ECLIPSE

367
01:56:25,563 --> 01:56:28,223
All that you touch

368
01:56:28,303 --> 01:56:30,763
All that you see

369
01:56:30,843 --> 01:56:33,123
All that you taste

370
01:56:33,483 --> 01:56:35,983
And all that you feel.

371
01:56:36,423 --> 01:56:38,793
All that you love

372
01:56:38,883 --> 01:56:41,483
All that you hate

373
01:56:41,573 --> 01:56:44,073
All you distrust.

374
01:56:44,203 --> 01:56:46,473
And all that you save.

375
01:56:46,503 --> 01:56:48,913
All that you give

376
01:56:48,953 --> 01:56:51,453
All that you deal

377
01:56:51,493 --> 01:56:54,233
All that you buy,

378
01:56:54,273 --> 01:56:56,943
beg, borrow or steal.

379
01:56:56,973 --> 01:56:59,383
All you create

380
01:56:59,423 --> 01:57:02,013
And all you destroy

381
01:57:02,043 --> 01:57:04,553
All that you do

382
01:57:04,593 --> 01:57:07,183
All that you say.

383
01:57:07,213 --> 01:57:09,903
All that you eat

384
01:57:09,943 --> 01:57:12,513
And everyone you meet

385
01:57:12,573 --> 01:57:15,183
All that you slight

386
01:57:15,223 --> 01:57:17,553
And everyone you fight.

387
01:57:17,583 --> 01:57:20,343
All that is now

388
01:57:20,373 --> 01:57:22,883
All that is gone

389
01:57:22,923 --> 01:57:25,323
All that's to come

390
01:57:25,363 --> 01:57:30,683
and everything under the sun is in tune

391
01:57:30,723 --> 01:57:34,903
but the sun is eclipsed by the moon.

392
01:59:10,403 --> 01:59:15,463
WISH YOU WERE HERE

393
02:01:26,233 --> 02:01:31,213
So, so you think you can tell

394
02:01:32,593 --> 02:01:35,353
Heaven from Hell

395
02:01:36,283 --> 02:01:39,133
Blue skies from pain

396
02:01:39,913 --> 02:01:43,093
Can you tell a green field

397
02:01:43,853 --> 02:01:47,243
From a cold steel rail

398
02:01:47,573 --> 02:01:50,573
A smile from a veil

399
02:01:51,503 --> 02:01:54,423
Do you think you can tell

400
02:01:55,033 --> 02:01:58,213
And did they get you to trade

401
02:01:58,903 --> 02:02:01,663
Your heroes for ghosts

402
02:02:02,583 --> 02:02:05,833
Hot ashes for trees

403
02:02:06,113 --> 02:02:09,143
Hot air for a cool breeze

404
02:02:09,493 --> 02:02:12,953
Cold comfort for change

405
02:02:13,183 --> 02:02:16,203
Did you exchange

406
02:02:16,463 --> 02:02:19,703
A walk on part in the war

407
02:02:19,823 --> 02:02:23,613
For a lead role in a cage

408
02:02:57,403 --> 02:02:59,323
How I wish

409
02:02:59,383 --> 02:03:02,113
How I wish you were here

410
02:03:03,273 --> 02:03:05,473
We're just two lost souls

411
02:03:05,543 --> 02:03:08,093
Swimming in a fish bowl

412
02:03:08,173 --> 02:03:10,703
Year after year

413
02:03:11,593 --> 02:03:14,843
Running over the same old ground

414
02:03:14,983 --> 02:03:17,303
What have we found

415
02:03:17,333 --> 02:03:20,393
The same old fears

416
02:03:20,423 --> 02:03:23,753
Wish you were here

417
02:05:16,903 --> 02:05:21,953
COMFORTABLY NUMB

418
02:05:29,833 --> 02:05:32,483
Hello,

419
02:05:32,753 --> 02:05:36,283
Is there anybody in there

420
02:05:37,333 --> 02:05:40,623
Just nod if you can hear me

421
02:05:42,253 --> 02:05:46,623
Is there anyone at home

422
02:05:47,013 --> 02:05:50,643
Come on now

423
02:05:50,803 --> 02:05:54,663
I hear you're feeling down

424
02:05:55,493 --> 02:05:59,013
I can ease your pain

425
02:05:59,143 --> 02:06:03,283
And get you on your feet again

426
02:06:04,163 --> 02:06:06,563
Relax

427
02:06:07,283 --> 02:06:11,873
I'll need some information first

428
02:06:12,763 --> 02:06:15,593
Just the basic facts

429
02:06:16,203 --> 02:06:20,603
Can you show me where it hurts

430
02:06:21,933 --> 02:06:27,123
There is no pain, you are receding

431
02:06:29,853 --> 02:06:35,243
A distant ship smoke on the horizon

432
02:06:37,533 --> 02:06:42,863
You are only coming through in waves

433
02:06:45,473 --> 02:06:51,223
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying

434
02:06:52,743 --> 02:06:58,813
When I was a child I had a fever

435
02:07:00,853 --> 02:07:06,443
My hands felt just like two balloons

436
02:07:08,863 --> 02:07:13,583
Now I've got that feeling once again

437
02:07:13,713 --> 02:07:18,383
I can't explain, you would not understand

438
02:07:18,493 --> 02:07:22,373
This is not how I am

439
02:07:24,503 --> 02:07:33,893
I have become comfortably numb

440
02:08:08,113 --> 02:08:15,393
I have become comfortably numb

441
02:08:17,893 --> 02:08:20,243
OK.

442
02:08:20,673 --> 02:08:23,783
Just a little pin prick

443
02:08:24,563 --> 02:08:27,723
There'll be no more

444
02:08:29,073 --> 02:08:32,253
But you may feel a little sick

445
02:08:32,873 --> 02:08:35,313
Can you stand up

446
02:08:36,043 --> 02:08:40,093
I do belive it's working, good

447
02:08:40,123 --> 02:08:44,483
That'll keep you going, through the show

448
02:08:45,283 --> 02:08:48,983
Come on it's time to go.

449
02:08:49,133 --> 02:08:54,823
There is no pain you are receding

450
02:08:57,173 --> 02:09:02,273
A distant ship smoke on the horizon

451
02:09:04,983 --> 02:09:10,243
You are only coming through in waves

452
02:09:12,373 --> 02:09:17,933
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying

453
02:09:20,043 --> 02:09:23,383
When I was a child

454
02:09:23,413 --> 02:09:26,903
I caught a fleeting glimpse

455
02:09:28,623 --> 02:09:33,133
Out of the corner of my eye

456
02:09:36,223 --> 02:09:40,463
I turned to look but it was gone

457
02:09:40,553 --> 02:09:45,163
I cannot put my finger on it now

458
02:09:45,193 --> 02:09:47,223
The child is grown

459
02:09:47,253 --> 02:09:49,623
The dream is gone

460
02:09:51,183 --> 02:09:57,803
And I... have become

461
02:09:57,833 --> 02:10:01,863
Comfortably numb.

462
02:14:52,633 --> 02:14:57,823
RUN LIKE HELL

463
02:18:05,302 --> 02:18:07,732
You better make your face up,

464
02:18:07,813 --> 02:18:09,593
In your favorite disguise,

465
02:18:09,633 --> 02:18:11,493
With your button-down lips,

466
02:18:11,523 --> 02:18:13,573
And your roller blind eyes.

467
02:18:13,603 --> 02:18:15,513
With your empty smile,

468
02:18:15,552 --> 02:18:17,533
And your hungry heart,

469
02:18:17,563 --> 02:18:19,503
Feel the bile rising,

470
02:18:19,543 --> 02:18:21,302
From your guilty past.

471
02:18:21,343 --> 02:18:23,699
With your nerves in tatters,

472
02:18:23,746 --> 02:18:25,587
As the cockleshell shatters,

473
02:18:25,623 --> 02:18:27,823
And the hammers batter,

474
02:18:27,863 --> 02:18:29,573
Down your door,

475
02:18:29,613 --> 02:18:32,493
You better run.

476
02:19:32,603 --> 02:19:35,173
You better run all day,

477
02:19:35,203 --> 02:19:36,923
And run all night.

478
02:19:36,953 --> 02:19:40,583
And keep your dirty feelings deep inside.

479
02:19:40,623 --> 02:19:44,373
And if you're taking your girlfriend out tonight,

480
02:19:44,403 --> 02:19:48,323
You better park the car well out of sight.

481
02:19:48,363 --> 02:19:50,773
Cause if they catch you in the back seat,

482
02:19:50,803 --> 02:19:52,523
Trying to pick her locks,

483
02:19:52,553 --> 02:19:54,973
They're gonna send you back to Mother,

484
02:19:55,013 --> 02:19:56,693
In a cardboard box.

485
02:19:56,723 --> 02:19:59,093
You better run!
