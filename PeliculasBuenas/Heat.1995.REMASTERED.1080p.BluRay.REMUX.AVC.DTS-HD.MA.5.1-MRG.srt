01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:58,230
I didn't wanna ruin their night too.
What was it?

676
01:02:00,608 --> 01:02:01,775
You don't wanna know.

677
01:02:01,943 --> 01:02:04,277
I'd like to know
what's behind that grim look.

678
01:02:04,445 --> 01:02:07,906
I don't do that. You know it.
Let's go. Come on.

679
01:02:08,074 --> 01:02:11,785
You never told me I'd be excluded.

680
01:02:12,995 --> 01:02:17,249
I told you when we hooked up, baby,
that you were gonna have to share me...

681
01:02:17,416 --> 01:02:21,169
...with all the bad people
and all the ugly events on this planet.

682
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:25,757
And I bought into that sharing
because I love you.

683
01:02:25,925 --> 01:02:31,847
I love you fat, bald, money, no money,
driving a bus. I don't care.

684
01:02:32,139 --> 01:02:35,225
But you have got to be present
like a normal guy some of the time.

685
01:02:35,393 --> 01:02:37,936
That's sharing.
This is not sharing, this is leftovers.

686
01:02:38,104 --> 01:02:41,106
Oh, I see. What I should do
is come home and say:

687
01:02:41,649 --> 01:02:45,151
"Hi, honey, guess what?
I walked into this house today...

688
01:02:45,319 --> 01:02:49,072
...where this junkie asshole
just fried his baby in a microwave...

689
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:52,868
...because it was crying too loud,
so let me share that with you.

690
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:55,871
Come on, let's share that,
and in sharing it...

691
01:02:56,038 --> 01:03:02,043
...we'll somehow cathartically dispel
all that heinous shit. "Right?

692
01:03:04,672 --> 01:03:07,048
Wrong. You know why?

693
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:09,384
Because you prefer the normal routine:

694
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:11,761
We fuck,
then you lose the power of speech.

695
01:03:11,929 --> 01:03:14,472
Because I gotta hold on to my angst.

696
01:03:14,682 --> 01:03:18,435
I preserve it, because I need it.
It keeps me sharp, on the edge.

697
01:03:18,644 --> 01:03:19,686
(SNAPPING FINGERS)

698
01:03:20,187 --> 01:03:22,022
Where I gotta be.

699
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:30,864
You don't live with me.

700
01:03:33,117 --> 01:03:36,286
You live among the remains
of dead people.

701
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:40,916
You read the terrain.

702
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:45,420
You search for signs of passing...

703
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:47,631
...for the scent of your prey...

704
01:03:47,798 --> 01:03:49,591
...and then you hunt them down.

705
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:54,804
That's the only thing
you're committed to.

706
01:03:57,642 --> 01:04:00,894
The rest is the mess you leave
as you pass through.

707
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:09,486
What I don't understand is
why I can't cut loose of you.

708
01:04:24,794 --> 01:04:27,253
DONALD: Hey. Miss Lillian.

709
01:04:28,881 --> 01:04:31,007
Let's go, baby.

710
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:37,305
I met the manager. Is that the boss?

711
01:04:37,890 --> 01:04:40,642
I did time for what
that motherfucker does every day.

712
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:45,230
Baby, can you just handle it
till we find you something new?

713
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:47,565
Can you do that?

714
01:04:49,402 --> 01:04:52,612
Ain't a hard time been invented
that I cannot handle.

715
01:04:58,494 --> 01:05:00,912
What you hanging with me for, Lillian?

716
01:05:02,123 --> 01:05:04,416
Because I'm proud of you.

717
01:05:05,584 --> 01:05:07,377
(CHUCKLING)

718
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:13,049
You're proud of me?
Mm-hm.

719
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:19,055
What the hell you proud of me for?

720
01:05:19,974 --> 01:05:22,017
Come on home.

721
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:35,780
What were you doing there?
I was skiing.

722
01:05:35,948 --> 01:05:38,158
I was trying to ski.

723
01:05:38,451 --> 01:05:41,703
That's what people do there.
You go skiing...

724
01:05:42,288 --> 01:05:44,205
...and you meet people.

725
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:45,874
You try to have a good time.

726
01:05:46,042 --> 01:05:47,709
Did you have a good time?
No.

727
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:49,002
Why not?

728
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:51,504
I'm not good at meeting people.

729
01:05:51,672 --> 01:05:53,590
You met me.

730
01:05:53,924 --> 01:05:56,676
Well, that happened
without my thinking about it.

731
01:05:56,844 --> 01:05:59,345
Which is why, probably.

732
01:05:59,513 --> 01:06:02,057
No, it's because you were fine.

733
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,643
Eady.

734
01:06:06,812 --> 01:06:09,355
Take off with me for a while.

735
01:06:10,191 --> 01:06:12,609
Where?
New Zealand.

736
01:06:12,777 --> 01:06:14,277
(CHUCKLES)

737
01:06:14,445 --> 01:06:16,029
When?

738
01:06:17,114 --> 01:06:19,574
I have to go separate,
but you could meet me there.

739
01:06:20,284 --> 01:06:21,743
But my job, my...

740
01:06:21,911 --> 01:06:26,748
I got money. You don't need money.
You could set up a studio, do work there.

741
01:06:27,041 --> 01:06:29,751
I don't know.
What's there to know?

742
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:31,878
Are you married?

743
01:06:32,963 --> 01:06:34,547
What?
You come and go...

744
01:06:34,715 --> 01:06:36,341
The last thing I am is married.

745
01:06:36,509 --> 01:06:39,552
I'm a needle starting at zero
going the other way, a double blank.

746
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:41,554
Then, all of a sudden...

747
01:06:42,223 --> 01:06:44,766
...someone like you comes along.

748
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:50,939
You don't know me, Neil.
I know enough.

749
01:06:54,568 --> 01:06:56,486
Come with me.

750
01:07:05,788 --> 01:07:07,914
What's wrong, baby?

751
01:07:09,083 --> 01:07:12,377
Nothing's wrong.
Everything's right. Will you go?

752
01:07:16,757 --> 01:07:18,466
Yeah.

753
01:07:21,595 --> 01:07:23,346
Good.

754
01:07:47,538 --> 01:07:49,914
Hey, sweetie.
LAUREN: Hi.

755
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:53,293
What happened? You forget
your mom was picking you up?

756
01:07:54,461 --> 01:07:56,254
No.

757
01:07:57,548 --> 01:07:59,632
So, what's going on?

758
01:08:01,051 --> 01:08:03,344
I felt like being alone.

759
01:08:05,014 --> 01:08:07,974
Okay. Come on, I'll drive you home.

760
01:08:12,813 --> 01:08:16,482
Hey, Mike.
Hey, Lauren.

761
01:09:04,657 --> 01:09:05,698
What's happening?

762
01:09:06,951 --> 01:09:08,701
Lieutenant. Sir.

763
01:09:08,869 --> 01:09:11,496
Captain Jackson wants to know
what's going on.

764
01:09:11,664 --> 01:09:14,666
Nothing's going on. Stay off the air.

765
01:09:29,807 --> 01:09:32,058
Jackson's a...

766
01:10:08,887 --> 01:10:10,555
Technique.

767
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:31,993
VINCENT: Open sesame. Right there.

768
01:11:29,259 --> 01:11:31,260
There he goes.

769
01:12:33,407 --> 01:12:35,074
We walk.
I'm right there.

770
01:12:35,242 --> 01:12:37,243
We walk! Now! Come on.

771
01:12:48,881 --> 01:12:50,673
(WHISPERING)
He's heard it.

772
01:12:51,383 --> 01:12:53,092
He's heard it.

773
01:13:01,602 --> 01:13:03,186
Heads up.

774
01:13:04,271 --> 01:13:05,980
One's coming out.
Hold it, captain.

775
01:13:06,148 --> 01:13:09,775
Vincent, he's not carrying anything.
Yeah, I see.

776
01:13:13,197 --> 01:13:15,156
Here we go.
Not till my boss says so.

777
01:13:15,324 --> 01:13:17,825
Vincent, both of them
are not carrying anything.

778
01:13:26,919 --> 01:13:28,669
Okay, let them go.
JACKSON: What do you mean?

779
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:29,879
<i>We can take them...</i>

780
01:13:30,047 --> 01:13:32,131
What are you gonna take them on?
Breaking and entry?

781
01:13:32,299 --> 01:13:34,383
They didn't steal anything.
Don't you get it?

782
01:13:34,551 --> 01:13:36,802
It gets knocked back
to some misdemeanor...

783
01:13:36,970 --> 01:13:39,472
...they do six months
and they're out. No fucking way.

784
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:42,767
I'm not taking the heat from my boss.
They're not walking.

785
01:13:42,935 --> 01:13:46,604
That's exactly what they're gonna do.
They're gonna walk. This is my operation.

786
01:13:46,772 --> 01:13:49,148
I have tactical command
that supersedes your rank.

787
01:13:49,316 --> 01:13:53,444
They will walk away
and you will let them. Fuck.

788
01:14:38,490 --> 01:14:40,575
Back to work.

789
01:14:41,785 --> 01:14:45,705
L.A.P.D. Gee, what?
Where the fuck did this heat come from?

790
01:14:45,872 --> 01:14:47,540
Maybe it's the score they were onto.

791
01:14:47,708 --> 01:14:51,168
The place, not us. Because
it's been hit a couple of times, you know.

792
01:14:51,336 --> 01:14:54,005
Assume they got our phones,
assume they got our houses...

793
01:14:54,172 --> 01:14:56,674
...assume they got us right here,
right now as we sit.

794
01:14:56,842 --> 01:14:58,801
Everything. Assume it all.

795
01:14:58,969 --> 01:15:01,053
How we gonna buy the bank package
from Kelso?

796
01:15:01,221 --> 01:15:04,390
I'll front that. That's not a problem.
What happens to Van Zant?

797
01:15:04,558 --> 01:15:08,561
With the heat we got, do you wanna play
World War ll in the streets with Van Zant?

798
01:15:08,729 --> 01:15:10,646
No, I want my 750.
And he gets a pass?

799
01:15:10,814 --> 01:15:15,151
I got more motivation to whack Van Zant
than either of you. He is a fucking luxury.

800
01:15:15,319 --> 01:15:17,737
Our problem is,
take the bank or split right now?

801
01:15:17,904 --> 01:15:20,406
Do not go home, do not pack, nothing.

802
01:15:20,574 --> 01:15:23,743
Thirty seconds flat from now,
we are gone on our separate ways.

803
01:15:23,910 --> 01:15:25,161
That's it.

804
01:15:25,329 --> 01:15:26,912
Chris.

805
01:15:30,083 --> 01:15:32,251
The bank is worth the risk.

806
01:15:32,419 --> 01:15:34,420
I need it, brother.

807
01:15:35,505 --> 01:15:39,258
We should stay and take it down.
That's where I come out.

808
01:15:49,728 --> 01:15:52,855
I roll with you, Neil.
Whatever. Whatever.

809
01:15:53,023 --> 01:15:56,484
No, not on this one, Michael.
On this one, you're on your own.

810
01:16:08,955 --> 01:16:11,457
You figure this is the best thing to do?

811
01:16:11,875 --> 01:16:13,459
This is the best thing to do?

812
01:16:13,627 --> 01:16:17,880
I got plans. I'm going away after. So for
me the reward is maybe worth the stretch.

813
01:16:18,048 --> 01:16:20,966
But Elaine takes good care of you.
You got plenty put away.

814
01:16:21,134 --> 01:16:22,635
You got T-bonds, real estate.

815
01:16:22,803 --> 01:16:26,180
If I were you, I would be smart.
I would cut loose of this.

816
01:16:43,407 --> 01:16:44,448
(CHUCKLES)

817
01:16:44,616 --> 01:16:48,327
Well, you know, for me,
the action is the juice.

818
01:16:48,495 --> 01:16:49,537
I'm in.

819
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:55,042
You too?

820
01:16:55,377 --> 01:16:56,961
Yeah, sure.

821
01:16:57,129 --> 01:16:58,796
MICHAEL: Ha-ha-ha.
Let's go.

822
01:16:58,964 --> 01:17:00,840
MICHAEL: Fuck them, let's do it.

823
01:17:01,007 --> 01:17:03,592
NEIL: All right, let's go.
We got a lot of work to do.

824
01:17:17,023 --> 01:17:18,941
WOMAN: You can't go in there.
VINCENT: Watch this.

825
01:17:19,109 --> 01:17:21,277
WOMAN: Excuse me. That...
ALAN: Tim, I gotta call you back.

826
01:17:21,445 --> 01:17:22,903
WOMAN:
You have to have an appointment.

827
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,905
Can I help you?
Are you Alan Marciano?

828
01:17:25,073 --> 01:17:27,533
Yeah, and who the fuck are you? Ow.
Who am I?

829
01:17:27,701 --> 01:17:30,786
Hey. Hey.
Lieutenant Vincent Hanna, L.A.P.D.

830
01:17:30,954 --> 01:17:34,206
L.A.? This is Las Vegas.
You don't even have jurisdiction here.

831
01:17:34,374 --> 01:17:37,877
Hey. Hey, I don't know who the fuck
you guys think you're pushing around...

832
01:17:38,044 --> 01:17:43,382
...but I know people here, okay?
Las Vegas P.D. takes you into custody.

833
01:17:44,009 --> 01:17:47,011
You are extradited to Newark
on a New Jersey warrant...

834
01:17:47,179 --> 01:17:50,431
...for smuggling cigarettes
up from North Carolina three years ago...

835
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:52,767
...or you go to work for us.

836
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:54,727
Cut and dried.

837
01:17:54,895 --> 01:17:57,730
That is it.
Oh, shit.

838
01:17:58,565 --> 01:18:00,649
Charlene Shiherlis.

839
01:18:00,817 --> 01:18:02,568
Who?
Who?

840
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:04,904
Who? What are you, a fucking owl?

841
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:08,908
SCHWARTZ: The lady you been talking dirty to
on the telephone every day the last week.

842
01:18:09,075 --> 01:18:11,327
Yeah, you know what?
You can't tie me to her.

843
01:18:11,495 --> 01:18:15,414
Who needs to? Your ass is on a plane
back to New Jersey, jack off.

844
01:18:15,582 --> 01:18:19,460
Oh, man, I just...
Why did I get mixed up with that bitch?

845
01:18:19,628 --> 01:18:22,338
Because she got a great ass!

846
01:18:23,757 --> 01:18:27,009
And you got your head all the way up it.

847
01:18:27,469 --> 01:18:28,594
ALAN: Jesus.

848
01:18:30,806 --> 01:18:34,767
When I think of asses, a woman's ass...

849
01:18:34,935 --> 01:18:37,269
...something comes out of me.

850
01:18:38,647 --> 01:18:40,689
So?
So no big thing.

851
01:18:41,525 --> 01:18:45,986
All I want is her husband
and his whole fucking crew.

852
01:18:46,154 --> 01:18:48,447
Now, you're gonna work
with Sergeant Drucker here.

853
01:18:52,911 --> 01:18:55,704
San Clemente Road and Hermosa.
Uh-huh.

854
01:18:55,872 --> 01:18:58,541
That's where we cut through the fence.
That's the access.

855
01:18:58,708 --> 01:18:59,834
Right.

856
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:02,837
The security systems
around here are a joke.

857
01:19:07,467 --> 01:19:10,135
St. Vincent Thomas Bridge,
that's Escape Route Number 1.

858
01:19:11,054 --> 01:19:14,306
Number 2, over here,
Anaheim to the 110.

859
01:19:14,766 --> 01:19:15,808
Good.
Okay?

860
01:19:15,976 --> 01:19:18,686
Yeah. That's fine.
Got it? Good. Let's go.

861
01:19:41,418 --> 01:19:43,669
CASALS: They were looking back...

862
01:19:44,170 --> 01:19:46,171
...in this direction.

863
01:19:46,506 --> 01:19:48,340
DRUCKER: A container facility?

864
01:19:48,508 --> 01:19:53,053
For a cartage theft?
Too visible. Too lowball for them.

865
01:19:56,182 --> 01:19:59,184
Next door's an oil refinery,
over there's a scrap yard.

866
01:19:59,352 --> 01:20:03,856
Refinery only pays by check. No cash around.
Same for the scrap yard.

867
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,570
Maybe they're stealing hubcaps.

868
01:20:12,824 --> 01:20:16,035
A refinery and a scrap yard.

869
01:20:16,369 --> 01:20:20,039
What the hell is going on?
That's what we're trying to figure out.

870
01:20:21,041 --> 01:20:23,042
We thought we had it.

871
01:20:23,835 --> 01:20:24,877
Thought we had it.

872
01:20:34,554 --> 01:20:39,099
I got an idea
of what they were looking at.

873
01:20:42,646 --> 01:20:45,314
You wanna know what they're looking at?
What?

874
01:20:46,775 --> 01:20:50,110
I mean, is this guy something,
or is he something?

875
01:20:51,237 --> 01:20:54,156
This crew is good.

876
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:57,493
You know what they were looking at?

877
01:20:57,911 --> 01:20:59,078
What?

878
01:21:00,330 --> 01:21:01,997
Us.

879
01:21:02,832 --> 01:21:04,917
The L.A.P.D.

880
01:21:05,085 --> 01:21:07,461
The police department.

881
01:21:08,129 --> 01:21:10,255
We just got made.

882
01:21:13,802 --> 01:21:15,344
(SHUTTER SNAPPING)

883
01:21:17,722 --> 01:21:19,473
Yeah.

884
01:21:27,399 --> 01:21:29,441
Okay.

885
01:21:31,403 --> 01:21:32,778
(LAUGHS)

886
01:21:38,201 --> 01:21:39,660
Okay, motherfucker!

887
01:22:00,557 --> 01:22:01,932
Kelso come through?

888
01:22:02,434 --> 01:22:05,310
NEIL:
Yeah, you can build a bank with these.

889
01:22:10,984 --> 01:22:14,153
Name is Hanna. First name Vincent.

890
01:22:14,696 --> 01:22:18,699
I smeared this sergeant in Vice five yards.
Hanna's all over you.

891
01:22:19,075 --> 01:22:21,827
He's on all the work cars.
Michael's house, Shiherlis'.

892
01:22:21,995 --> 01:22:24,329
Not yours,
they've been losing you at night.

893
01:22:24,497 --> 01:22:28,584
Hanna's a hot dog. Graduate school.
Marine Corps.

894
01:22:28,752 --> 01:22:30,878
Lieutenant, Robbery-Homicide,
Major Crime Unit.

895
01:22:31,046 --> 01:22:34,339
He's taken down some heavy crews.
Blew away Frankie Yonder in Chicago.

896
01:22:34,507 --> 01:22:36,759
And he was a fucking maniac.

897
01:22:37,010 --> 01:22:41,180
He was working Narcotics before that.
Had some problems, divorced twice.

898
01:22:41,347 --> 01:22:44,349
Current wife's Justine.
He's why the extra heat.

899
01:22:46,644 --> 01:22:48,520
The Vice sergeant...

900
01:22:49,564 --> 01:22:51,857
...says Hanna likes you.

901
01:22:52,525 --> 01:22:55,944
Thinks you're some kind of star.
You do this sharp, you do that sharp.

902
01:22:56,112 --> 01:22:59,073
Look how sharp this guy is
to figure that.

903
01:23:00,950 --> 01:23:03,035
Funny as a heart attack, man.
Three marriages.

904
01:23:03,203 --> 01:23:06,497
What the fuck do you think that means?
He likes staying home?

905
01:23:06,873 --> 01:23:09,374
Means the man is one of those guys
out there...

906
01:23:09,542 --> 01:23:12,461
...prowling around all night, dedicated.

907
01:23:14,714 --> 01:23:16,965
With this guy and this much heat,
you should pass.

908
01:23:24,349 --> 01:23:25,724
It's worth the stretch.

909
01:23:26,935 --> 01:23:31,563
This guy can hit and miss.
You can't miss once.

910
01:23:31,898 --> 01:23:33,732
You sure?

911
01:23:34,150 --> 01:23:36,068
I'm sure.

912
01:23:41,407 --> 01:23:42,741
Let's go to the garage.

913
01:23:56,589 --> 01:23:58,257
Justine.

914
01:24:03,596 --> 01:24:05,556
Justine?

915
01:24:11,437 --> 01:24:13,230
Where we going?

916
01:24:18,153 --> 01:24:21,321
Okay, where are you going?
Out.

917
01:25:19,672 --> 01:25:22,674
What are you on?
MAN: TAC 9.

918
01:25:25,094 --> 01:25:27,221
(MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY
OVER RADIO)

919
01:25:46,699 --> 01:25:49,409
This is Vincent Hanna in Air 18.
Who have I got?

920
01:25:49,744 --> 01:25:53,330
<i>JJ: Hey, Vincent, it's JJ. I'm in Air 40.
Richard Glover's with me.</i>

921
01:25:53,498 --> 01:25:57,668
<i>It's on the 105 eastbound
approaching the 110 interchange.</i>

922
01:25:58,336 --> 01:26:02,714
<i>You running a revolving tail?
Yeah, I got two units in front, three behind.</i>

923
01:26:02,882 --> 01:26:06,927
Okay, have one of them pick me up
at the Vermont on-ramp.

924
01:26:07,136 --> 01:26:08,512
Let's go.

925
01:26:58,521 --> 01:27:02,482
Am I 100 yards, or what?
Am I close or far, or what?

926
01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:05,235
<i>CASALS:
Three hundred yards, center lane.</i>

927
01:28:11,844 --> 01:28:13,678
How you doing?

928
01:28:16,849 --> 01:28:19,893
What do you say
I buy you a cup of coffee?

929
01:28:26,025 --> 01:28:29,319
Yeah, sure. Let's go.
Follow me.

930
01:28:45,086 --> 01:28:47,546
Seven years in Folsom.

931
01:28:47,713 --> 01:28:49,548
In the hole for three.

932
01:28:49,715 --> 01:28:51,007
McNeil before that.

933
01:28:54,595 --> 01:28:56,930
McNeil as tough as they say?

934
01:28:57,807 --> 01:28:59,683
You looking to become a penologist?

935
01:29:00,935 --> 01:29:04,062
You're looking to go back?
You know, I chase down some crews...

936
01:29:04,230 --> 01:29:08,650
...guys just looking to fuck up,
get busted back. That you?

937
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,570
You must've worked some dipshit crews.

938
01:29:12,363 --> 01:29:14,573
I worked all kinds.

939
01:29:17,577 --> 01:29:20,120
You see me doing thrill-seeking
liquor-store holdups...

940
01:29:20,288 --> 01:29:22,622
...with a "Born to Lose" tattoo
on my chest?

941
01:29:22,790 --> 01:29:25,625
No, I do not.
Right.

942
01:29:26,794 --> 01:29:28,628
I am never going back.

943
01:29:30,256 --> 01:29:32,507
Then don't take down scores.

944
01:29:33,676 --> 01:29:36,303
I do what I do best, I take scores.

945
01:29:36,471 --> 01:29:40,098
You do what you do best,
trying to stop guys like me.

946
01:29:43,311 --> 01:29:46,146
So you never wanted a regular-type life?

947
01:29:46,314 --> 01:29:49,316
What the fuck is that?
Barbecues and ball games?

948
01:29:51,068 --> 01:29:52,194
Yeah.

949
01:29:54,655 --> 01:29:59,868
This regular-type life like your life?
My life? No, my life...

950
01:30:00,828 --> 01:30:02,787
No, my life's a disaster zone.

951
01:30:04,540 --> 01:30:07,375
I got a stepdaughter so fucked up...

952
01:30:07,543 --> 01:30:10,629
...because her real father
is this large-type asshole.

953
01:30:10,796 --> 01:30:14,674
I got a wife. We're passing each other
on the down slope of a marriage...

954
01:30:14,842 --> 01:30:16,718
...my third...

955
01:30:18,137 --> 01:30:21,806
...because I spend all my time
chasing guys like you around the block.

956
01:30:21,974 --> 01:30:24,017
That's my life.

957
01:30:29,815 --> 01:30:32,067
A guy told me one time:

958
01:30:33,486 --> 01:30:35,612
"Don't let yourself get attached
to anything...

959
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:38,490
...you are not willing to walk out on
in 30 seconds flat...

960
01:30:38,658 --> 01:30:40,825
...if you feel the heat around the corner."

961
01:30:41,869 --> 01:30:45,288
Now, if you're on me,
and you gotta move when I move...

962
01:30:45,456 --> 01:30:48,625
...how do you expect to keep a marriage?

963
01:30:50,419 --> 01:30:52,671
Well, that's an interesting point.

964
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:56,049
What are you, a monk?

965
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:58,009
I have a woman.

966
01:30:58,177 --> 01:31:00,178
What do you tell her?

967
01:31:02,014 --> 01:31:04,140
I tell her I'm a salesman.

968
01:31:10,481 --> 01:31:14,025
So then, if you spot me coming
around that corner...

969
01:31:14,694 --> 01:31:17,195
...you're just gonna walk out
on this woman?

970
01:31:17,989 --> 01:31:20,156
Not say goodbye?

971
01:31:20,408 --> 01:31:22,659
That's the discipline.

972
01:31:22,868 --> 01:31:24,786
That's pretty vacant, no?

973
01:31:24,954 --> 01:31:26,621
Yeah, it is what it is.

974
01:31:26,789 --> 01:31:29,416
It's that, or we both better
go do something else, pal.

975
01:31:31,544 --> 01:31:33,336
I don't know how to do anything else.

976
01:31:33,921 --> 01:31:35,797
Neither do I.

977
01:31:38,259 --> 01:31:41,720
I don't much want to either.
Neither do I.

978
01:31:49,395 --> 01:31:52,981
You know, I have this recurring dream.

979
01:31:53,941 --> 01:31:56,610
I'm sitting at this big banquet table...

980
01:31:56,777 --> 01:32:00,655
...and all the victims of all the murders
I ever worked are sitting at this table...

981
01:32:00,823 --> 01:32:05,076
...and they're staring at me
with these black eyeballs...

982
01:32:05,244 --> 01:32:10,248
...because they got eight-ball hemorrhages
from the head wounds.

983
01:32:10,583 --> 01:32:14,085
And there they are,
these big balloon people...

984
01:32:14,253 --> 01:32:17,339
...because I found them two weeks
after they'd been under the bed.

985
01:32:18,174 --> 01:32:21,009
The neighbors reported the smell...

986
01:32:21,552 --> 01:32:25,555
...and there they are,
all of them just sitting there.

987
01:32:27,266 --> 01:32:28,308
What do they say?

988
01:32:30,519 --> 01:32:31,770
Nothing.

989
01:32:31,937 --> 01:32:33,605
No talk?
None.

990
01:32:33,773 --> 01:32:37,400
Just...
They don't have anything to say.

991
01:32:38,027 --> 01:32:40,445
See, we just look at each other.

992
01:32:40,905 --> 01:32:45,742
They look at me.
And that's it, that's the dream.

993
01:32:48,079 --> 01:32:50,497
I have one where I'm drowning.

994
01:32:50,790 --> 01:32:54,334
And I gotta wake myself up and
start breathing, or I'll die in my sleep.

995
01:32:56,545 --> 01:32:57,921
You know what that's about?

996
01:32:58,422 --> 01:33:01,132
Yeah. Having enough time.

997
01:33:02,677 --> 01:33:07,889
Enough time to do what you wanna do?
That's right.

998
01:33:09,850 --> 01:33:13,478
You doing it now?
No, not yet.

999
01:33:18,359 --> 01:33:20,652
You know, we're sitting here...

1000
01:33:21,696 --> 01:33:23,822
...you and I,
like a couple of regular fellows.

1001
01:33:23,989 --> 01:33:26,700
You do what you do,
and I do what I gotta do.

1002
01:33:28,994 --> 01:33:31,996
And now that we've been face to face...

1003
01:33:34,291 --> 01:33:39,295
...if I'm there and I gotta put you away,
I won't like it.

1004
01:33:39,672 --> 01:33:40,797
But I'll tell you...

1005
01:33:43,342 --> 01:33:46,845
...if it's between you
and some poor bastard...

1006
01:33:47,012 --> 01:33:49,514
...whose wife you're gonna
turn into a widow...

1007
01:33:50,349 --> 01:33:54,686
...brother, you are going down.

1008
01:34:06,407 --> 01:34:09,242
There's a flip side to that coin.

1009
01:34:11,036 --> 01:34:15,373
What if you do got me boxed in
and I gotta put you down?

1010
01:34:16,667 --> 01:34:21,379
Because no matter what,
you will not get in my way.

1011
01:34:22,089 --> 01:34:25,008

Well, he's got blood loss and shock.

1183
01:54:45,603 --> 01:54:50,148
I'm gonna give you quarter-grain morphine
for the pain. Subcutaneous injection.

Bottom line.

1185
01:54:52,193 --> 01:54:56,279
It's mostly tissue damage, which is good,
but his clavicle's fractured.

Can he rest for a while?
Six, seven hours.

That's it.

it to me for Father's Day.

Did you say anything
about how we're getting out?

1230
01:58:20,276 --> 01:58:23,320
I don't think so, Neil.
Come on.

I don't remember, Neil.

1232
01:58:32,413 --> 01:58:36,124
I'll call a medic.
I'm not gonna make it.

already had a getaway?

Sure he did. Now he needs another one.
Would you trust yours after this afternoon?

where did we get him?

He's a Cl for a burglary cop.
Called in the tip on the bank.

1261
02:00:33,701 --> 02:00:37,245
On Neil McCauley,
how much time we got?

1262
02:00:37,413 --> 02:00:40,790
Eight, 10 hours for him to set up a new out.
After that, he's gone.

Why don't you fix her a drink or something?

Look in the cabinet above the sink.
Fuck her.

1283
02:03:33,047 --> 02:03:36,174
You'd better get in there and stay in there.
All right, all right.

02:03:38,928 --> 02:03:41,179
Well, lookie here.

1285

My name is Sergeant Drucker,
L.A.P.D. Homicide.

You wanna put Dominick in the bedroom?
He stays with me.

There we go.

02:03:58,822 --> 02:04:00,782
So, what now?

1289
02:04:03,035 --> 02:04:06,788
Well, he's right,
because you want out, this is out.

1290
02:04:08,207 --> 02:04:12,085
You believe you have to betray Chris.
No shit.

1291
02:04:12,253 --> 02:04:15,213
That's right. You would have to.

1292
02:04:15,381 --> 02:04:19,634
See, if you don't betray Chris,
you victimize Dominick.

1293
02:04:20,135 --> 02:04:23,346
Because he becomes an orphan
when you go to prison as an accessory...

1294
02:04:23,514 --> 02:04:25,974
...because you got no living parents
to take him.

1295
02:04:26,141 --> 02:04:30,520
So he ends up state-raised in
foster homes, juvenile facilities.

1296
02:04:30,688 --> 02:04:32,939
Then he steals a car.

1297
02:04:33,190 --> 02:04:38,361
Then he winds up in gladiator academies
like Chino and Tracy.

1298
02:04:38,529 --> 02:04:41,823
Fucked for life.

1299
02:04:41,991 --> 02:04:45,326
You know what happens,
because you've been there.

1300
02:04:46,495 --> 02:04:51,666
Dominick didn't get a chance yet
to choose his life, but Chris did.

1301
02:04:52,751 --> 02:04:56,337
If you give up Chris, you get off clean.

1302
02:04:56,505 --> 02:05:00,425
You can do it for your kid,
so you can raise him.

1303
02:05:04,597 --> 02:05:07,974
What else are you selling?
All kinds of shit.

1304
02:05:08,851 --> 02:05:14,063
But I don't have to sell this and you know it,

Apparently, Neil got sold out to us
by this cowboy named Waingro.

1316
02:06:04,782 --> 02:06:07,533
Waingro used to be a part
of Neil's crew...

1317

...then he went to work
for a money launderer named Van Zant.

because he got shot dead earlier tonight.

Now, if Neil goes after anybody else,
it's gonna be Waingro.
