1
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,792
Come to Los Angeles.

2
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,297
The sun shines bright, the
beaches are wide and inviting...

3
00:00:33,464 --> 00:00:37,050
and the orange groves stretch
as far as the eye can see.

4
00:00:37,927 --> 00:00:41,180
There are jobs aplenty
and land is cheap.

5
00:00:41,389 --> 00:00:43,724
Every workingman can
have his own house...

6
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:48,645
and inside every house, a
happy, all-American family.

7
00:00:48,813 --> 00:00:51,857
You can have all
this. And who knows?

8
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:54,109
You could even be discovered...

9
00:00:54,277 --> 00:00:57,571
become a movie star,
or at least see one.

10
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:00,032
Life is good in Los Angeles.

11
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,868
It's paradise on Earth.

12
00:01:04,704 --> 00:01:09,041
That's what they tell you, anyway,
because they're selling an image.

13
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:12,920
They're selling it through
movies, radio and television.

14
00:01:13,087 --> 00:01:16,965
In the hit show "Badge of Honour,"
the L.A. cops walk on water...

15
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:19,593
as they keep the city
clean of crooks.

16
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:23,138
Yep, you'd think this place
was the Garden of Eden.

17
00:01:23,306 --> 00:01:25,557
But there's trouble in paradise...

18
00:01:25,725 --> 00:01:30,103
and his name is Meyer Harris
Cohen, Mickey C to his fans.

19
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:32,875
Local L.A. colour
to the nth degree.

20
00:01:32,876 --> 00:01:34,983
And his number-one bodyguard...

21
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:37,611
Johnny Stompanato.

22
00:01:37,779 --> 00:01:40,697
Mickey C's the head of organised
crime in these parts.

23
00:01:40,865 --> 00:01:43,593
He runs dope, rackets
and prostitution.

24
00:01:43,594 --> 00:01:45,911
He kills a dozen people a year...

25
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,623
and the dapper little
gent does it in style.

26
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:52,751
And every time his picture's
on the front page...

27
00:01:52,919 --> 00:01:55,963
it's a black eye for the
image of Los Angeles.

28
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,590
Because how can organised
crime exist...

29
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:02,302
in the city with the best
police force in the world?

30
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:03,762
Something has to be done.

31
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,015
But nothing too original,
because, hey, this is Hollywood.

32
00:02:07,225 --> 00:02:10,352
What worked for Al Capone
would work for the Mickster.

33
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,815
Mr Cohen, you're under arrest.
Non-payment of federal income tax.

34
00:02:15,149 --> 00:02:16,733
But all is not well.

35
00:02:16,943 --> 00:02:19,152
Sending Mickey up has
created a vacuum,

36
00:02:19,153 --> 00:02:21,029
and it's only a matter of time...

37
00:02:21,197 --> 00:02:25,200
before someone with balls
of brass tries to fill it.

38
00:02:25,368 --> 00:02:31,081
"Remember, dear readers,
you heard it here first."

39
00:02:31,249 --> 00:02:35,836
Off the record, on the Q.T...

40
00:02:36,004 --> 00:02:39,506
"and very hushush."

41
00:02:57,859 --> 00:03:00,411
You're like Santa
Claus with that list,

42
00:03:00,412 --> 00:03:03,155
Bud, except everyone
on it's been naughty.

43
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:07,075
Guy's been out of Q two weeks.

44
00:03:07,744 --> 00:03:08,785
Leave it for later.

45
00:03:08,953 --> 00:03:11,872
We gotta pick up the booze
and get it to the station.

46
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,335
Hollywood, this is 6-Adam-7.

47
00:03:16,502 --> 00:03:20,464
Have Central send a prowler
to 4216 Evergreen.

48
00:03:20,631 --> 00:03:23,342
Parole violation. Assault
arising from a family dispute.

49
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:25,260
We won't be here, but
they'll see him.

50
00:03:34,937 --> 00:03:36,104
Quit your whining.

51
00:03:36,272 --> 00:03:38,523
Quit whining all the
time. It makes me sick.

52
00:03:38,858 --> 00:03:40,734
Shut up.

53
00:03:55,249 --> 00:03:58,794
- Who in the hell are you?
- The ghost of Christmas past.

54
00:03:59,837 --> 00:04:01,281
Dance with a man for a change.

55
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,131
What are you, some
kind of smart-ass?

56
00:04:16,646 --> 00:04:18,700
You'll be out in a
year and a half.

57
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:20,982
I'll get cosy with
your parole officer.

58
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:25,779
You touch her again, I'll have you
violated on a kiddie-raper beef.

59
00:04:26,864 --> 00:04:29,991
You know what they do to
kiddie rapers in Quentin.

60
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,086
You got some place you can go?

61
00:04:41,963 --> 00:04:44,172
Go get yourself fixed up.

62
00:04:48,678 --> 00:04:49,845
Merry Christmas, huh?

63
00:04:50,513 --> 00:04:53,181
- Merry Christmas, ma'am.
- Let's go, Bud.

64
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:55,142
The guys will be waiting.

65
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:01,148
What do you do on "Badge
of Honour," Jack?

66
00:05:01,357 --> 00:05:04,151
I'm the, technical adviser.

67
00:05:04,318 --> 00:05:08,029
I teach Brett Chase how to
walk and talk like a cop.

68
00:05:08,197 --> 00:05:10,365
Brett Chase doesn't
walk and talk like you.

69
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:13,201
Well, that's because he's
the television version.

70
00:05:13,369 --> 00:05:15,537
America isn't ready
for the real me.

71
00:05:15,705 --> 00:05:17,706
Is it true you're the one
who arrested Bob Mitchum?

72
00:05:19,083 --> 00:05:20,709
These "Badge of Honour"
guys like to pretend...

73
00:05:20,877 --> 00:05:23,795
but being the real thing
must be a thrill.

74
00:05:23,963 --> 00:05:25,797
Why don't you and I
go some place quiet?

75
00:05:25,965 --> 00:05:28,216
I'd love to give you the
lowdown on Mitchum.

76
00:05:28,384 --> 00:05:31,344
- Big V. Jack Vincennes.
- Hey.

77
00:05:31,512 --> 00:05:33,096
- May I have this dance?
- Of course.

78
00:05:33,264 --> 00:05:35,599
Karen, this is Sid Hudgens
from Hush-Hush magazine.

79
00:05:35,766 --> 00:05:38,101
- Hello, Karen.
- Hello, yourself.

80
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:40,854
What's that about?

81
00:05:41,022 --> 00:05:42,693
We did a piece, "ingénue Dykes in

82
00:05:42,694 --> 00:05:44,566
Hollywood." Her
name got mentioned.

83
00:05:45,526 --> 00:05:46,943
Hey, Jackie boy...

84
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:49,696
a friend just sold some
reefer to Matt Reynolds.

85
00:05:49,864 --> 00:05:52,824
He's tripping the "Light
Fantastic" with Tammy Jordan.

86
00:05:54,452 --> 00:05:56,453
Sorry, I lost you
for a second, Sid.

87
00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:58,621
Contract players, Metro. You pinch

88
00:05:58,622 --> 00:06:00,916
them, I do a nice
feature next issue.

89
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:03,543
- Plus the usual 50 cash.
- No, I need another 50.

90
00:06:03,753 --> 00:06:07,214
Two 20s for two patrolmen, and a
dime for the watch commander.

91
00:06:07,381 --> 00:06:09,883
Jackie, it's Christmas.

92
00:06:10,051 --> 00:06:11,384
No, it's not.

93
00:06:11,552 --> 00:06:13,595
It's felony possession
of marijuana.

94
00:06:15,181 --> 00:06:18,725
Actually, it's circulation
36,000 and climbing.

95
00:06:18,893 --> 00:06:21,686
There's no telling where this
is gonna go. Radio, television.

96
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,044
Once you whet the
public's appetite

97
00:06:24,045 --> 00:06:25,857
for the truth, the
sky's the limit.

98
00:06:30,947 --> 00:06:33,949
Sergeant Ed Exley, son of the
legendary Preston Exley.

99
00:06:34,242 --> 00:06:35,784
Must be a hard act to follow.

100
00:06:37,453 --> 00:06:40,622
Why not make a mark somewhere
else? Why become a cop, Ed?

101
00:06:41,082 --> 00:06:42,874
I like to help people.

102
00:06:43,084 --> 00:06:45,710
We heard two officers were
assaulted this evening.

103
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,672
- What do you think about that?
- Goes with the job.

104
00:06:48,881 --> 00:06:50,799
I took the report.
Luckily, they're okay.

105
00:06:51,008 --> 00:06:52,926
Aren't you young to
be watch commander?

106
00:06:53,094 --> 00:06:54,135
It's only tonight.

107
00:06:54,595 --> 00:06:57,138
The married men have
Christmas Eve off.

108
00:06:57,306 --> 00:06:58,745
That's a good lead for the story.

109
00:06:58,746 --> 00:07:01,393
- Sure.
- Merry Christmas, captain.

110
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:04,104
- Captain Smith.
- Drop the formalities, Bobby.

111
00:07:04,272 --> 00:07:06,080
It's Christmas Eve.
Call me Dudley.

112
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:07,983
I came up with a
title for the story.

113
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,986
I'm calling it "Silent
Night with the L.A.P.D."

114
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,737
That's grand.

115
00:07:13,656 --> 00:07:16,658
Now, remember, Bobby,
that's "Smith." With an S.

116
00:07:19,495 --> 00:07:21,246
Thank you, gentlemen.
Merry Christmas.

117
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:22,998
- Thank you.
- Hold on there, lads.

118
00:07:26,294 --> 00:07:29,045
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.

119
00:07:30,423 --> 00:07:33,300
I saw the test results on
the lieutenant's exam.

120
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:36,720
First out of 23.
What'll it be, then?

121
00:07:36,887 --> 00:07:39,347
Patrol Division?
Internal Affairs? What?

122
00:07:39,515 --> 00:07:41,016
I was thinking Detective Bureau.

123
00:07:45,646 --> 00:07:48,648
Edmund, you're a political animal.

124
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:51,901
You have the eye for human
weakness, but not the stomach.

125
00:07:53,613 --> 00:07:55,363
You're wrong, sir.

126
00:07:55,531 --> 00:07:57,432
Would you be willing
to plant evidence

127
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:59,284
on a suspect you
knew to be guilty...

128
00:07:59,493 --> 00:08:01,286
in order to ensure an indictment?

129
00:08:01,537 --> 00:08:03,622
- We've been over this.
- Yes or no?

130
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:04,956
No.

131
00:08:05,124 --> 00:08:08,209
Would you beat a confession out of
a suspect you knew to be guilty?

132
00:08:08,377 --> 00:08:09,377
No.

133
00:08:09,545 --> 00:08:12,213
Would you shoot a hardened
criminal in the back...

134
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:14,758
in order to offset the
chance that some lawyer...?

135
00:08:14,925 --> 00:08:16,259
No.

136
00:08:16,427 --> 00:08:19,596
Then for the love of God,
don't be a detective.

137
00:08:19,764 --> 00:08:22,724
Stick to assignments where you
don't have to make those choices.

138
00:08:23,225 --> 00:08:25,226
Dudley, I know you mean well...

139
00:08:25,561 --> 00:08:29,397
but I don't need to do it the
way you did, or my father.

140
00:08:30,566 --> 00:08:32,692
At least get rid of the glasses.

141
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,528
I can't think of a man in
the bureau who wears them.

142
00:08:44,705 --> 00:08:46,831
If I get held up, you
guys better be here.

143
00:08:52,755 --> 00:08:55,507
Hi, Nick. I need a delivery.

144
00:08:55,675 --> 00:08:58,426
A case each of gin, rum, Scotch.

145
00:08:58,594 --> 00:09:01,221
That sounds like a hell of a
party. Be right with you.

146
00:09:20,116 --> 00:09:21,241
Merry Christmas.

147
00:09:23,077 --> 00:09:25,036
Merry Christmas to you, officer.

148
00:09:27,748 --> 00:09:29,040
That obvious, huh?

149
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:31,960
It's practically stamped
on your forehead.

150
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,045
There you go, White.

151
00:10:07,163 --> 00:10:08,997
See what he wants, Buzz.

152
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,835
Hey.

153
00:10:14,003 --> 00:10:16,004
Get lost, why don't you?

154
00:10:23,304 --> 00:10:25,513
Down. Get your fucking head down.

155
00:10:25,681 --> 00:10:28,683
I got a licence for that.

156
00:10:31,854 --> 00:10:34,564
Cut me some slack. I
used to be a cop.

157
00:10:34,774 --> 00:10:36,858
"Leland Meeks."
Never heard of you.

158
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:39,360
They call me Buzz.

159
00:10:39,528 --> 00:10:43,031
I don't give a rat's ass what they
call you. Keep your head down.

160
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:46,159
And stay there, Buzz.

161
00:10:48,037 --> 00:10:50,830
- You okay?
- She's fine.

162
00:10:51,207 --> 00:10:52,624
I'm not asking you, sir.

163
00:10:54,585 --> 00:10:58,046
- Somebody hit you?
- It's not what you think.

164
00:11:01,342 --> 00:11:02,383
What is it, then?

165
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:05,970
You got the wrong idea,
mister. I'm fine.

166
00:11:06,555 --> 00:11:09,349
But it's nice to know you care.

167
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,734
Drive safely.

168
00:11:20,694 --> 00:11:22,445
What's going on?

169
00:11:25,866 --> 00:11:29,661
- You know him?
- Yeah, I've seen him around.

170
00:11:30,913 --> 00:11:32,539
He used to be a cop.

171
00:11:39,129 --> 00:11:41,756
They're sitting in the dark,
goofing on a Christmas tree.

172
00:11:41,924 --> 00:11:44,551
All right. Put your
camera right there.

173
00:11:44,718 --> 00:11:46,837
When I walk out,
I'll stop here. Get

174
00:11:46,838 --> 00:11:49,013
the movie premiere
in the background.

175
00:11:49,223 --> 00:11:52,100
I like it. I like it. "The
Movie Premiere Pot Bust."

176
00:11:52,268 --> 00:11:55,353
When I walk out, I don't want
those floodlights in my eyes.

177
00:11:55,563 --> 00:11:58,106
Big V, consider it done.
You hear that, Chip?

178
00:11:58,274 --> 00:12:00,608
All right, come on. Get down.

179
00:12:04,738 --> 00:12:06,656
Go. Pop them.

180
00:12:09,994 --> 00:12:11,244
Freeze. Police.

181
00:12:12,162 --> 00:12:15,915
Hold it. Come on.
Come on, let's go.

182
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,292
I got my family coming...

183
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:20,753
- it'll be a nice Christmas gift.
- Hi, Tammy. Hi, Matt.

184
00:12:20,963 --> 00:12:22,005
Right over here.

185
00:12:22,214 --> 00:12:24,257
- Just turn.
- Hold it. Got it.

186
00:12:25,217 --> 00:12:27,070
"The Movie Premiere Pot Bust."

187
00:12:27,071 --> 00:12:29,387
Take them in. I'll
get the evidence.

188
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:44,152
It's Christmas Eve in
the City of Angels...

189
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,572
and while decent citizens sleep
the sleep of the righteous...

190
00:12:47,781 --> 00:12:50,199
hopheads prowl for marijuana...

191
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:53,745
not knowing that a man
is coming to stop them:

192
00:12:54,204 --> 00:12:57,665
Celebrity crime-stopper
Jack Vincennes...

193
00:12:57,833 --> 00:13:02,629
scourge of grasshoppers and
dope fiends everywhere.

194
00:13:02,796 --> 00:13:05,173
You like it, Jackie boy?

195
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:08,635
Yeah, subtle.

196
00:13:09,303 --> 00:13:10,345
What took you?

197
00:13:10,512 --> 00:13:13,389
My partner stopped to help
a damsel in distress.

198
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,225
His priorities are all screwed up.

199
00:13:16,393 --> 00:13:18,186
Up to your old tricks again, Bud?

200
00:13:18,604 --> 00:13:19,687
Bye.

201
00:13:19,855 --> 00:13:23,566
Hollywood Jack, what brings you
to our humble station house?

202
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:25,526
- How are you?
- What are you doing here?

203
00:13:25,694 --> 00:13:27,695
You know me. Keeping the
streets safe, boys.

204
00:13:27,905 --> 00:13:30,365
Take these two, get them
dressed and book them.

205
00:13:30,658 --> 00:13:33,284
- The party's upstairs.
- Okay, I'll be right up. Exley.

206
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,500
What's that for?

207
00:13:40,668 --> 00:13:43,169
Well, you are watch commander
tonight, aren't you?

208
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:44,420
Yeah. So?

209
00:13:44,588 --> 00:13:46,340
A gratuity from
Hush-Hush magazine.

210
00:13:46,341 --> 00:13:48,091
Buy yourself a new
pair of loafers.

211
00:13:48,342 --> 00:13:50,802
No, thanks, Jack. You
keep your pay-off.

212
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:52,720
I'm not interested.

213
00:14:00,896 --> 00:14:03,815
- What the hell's this?
- Six spics.

214
00:14:03,983 --> 00:14:07,360
Mexicans, sir. The ones who
assaulted Brown and Helenowski.

215
00:14:07,528 --> 00:14:10,530
I heard Helenowski lost six pints
of blood and Brown's in a coma.

216
00:14:10,698 --> 00:14:12,407
They're home with bruises.

217
00:14:12,574 --> 00:14:15,326
- That's not what I heard.
- Get these men into the lock-up.

218
00:14:15,494 --> 00:14:17,892
Stens, you guys hear
what those taco

219
00:14:17,893 --> 00:14:20,289
benders did to
Helenowski and Brown?

220
00:14:21,542 --> 00:14:24,021
Helenowski lost an
eye, and they're

221
00:14:24,022 --> 00:14:26,087
reading Brown his last rites.

222
00:14:27,881 --> 00:14:29,528
That ought to make
for a very merry

223
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:31,175
Christmas for
Helenowski and Brown.

224
00:14:31,343 --> 00:14:35,555
Hey, guys. Guys. They
brought the Mexicans in.

225
00:14:36,932 --> 00:14:38,266
They're downstairs.

226
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:43,438
- Let's do it.
- Come on, guys. Let's get them.

227
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:48,067
Stensland, the party's upstairs.

228
00:14:49,778 --> 00:14:51,404
This doesn't concern you.

229
00:14:52,406 --> 00:14:54,949
Come on, guys. Haven't
you got work to do?

230
00:14:55,117 --> 00:14:56,284
Go back to the party.

231
00:14:57,578 --> 00:14:59,494
Come on, it's
Christmas. Help me out.

232
00:14:59,495 --> 00:15:00,788
Out of the way. Move it.

233
00:15:00,956 --> 00:15:02,879
I just got a few more questions.

234
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,084
You don't all have
to be down here.

235
00:15:05,627 --> 00:15:06,627
Go.

236
00:15:08,881 --> 00:15:10,651
Hey, White? You
better put a leash on

237
00:15:10,652 --> 00:15:12,467
your partner before
he kills somebody.

238
00:15:15,471 --> 00:15:17,597
Teach him a lesson.
Get him, Stens.

239
00:15:18,766 --> 00:15:20,808
This is for ours, Pancho.

240
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,311
Get him, Stens.

241
00:15:23,604 --> 00:15:24,645
Let me through.

242
00:15:26,482 --> 00:15:27,940
No. He didn't do nothing.

243
00:15:28,108 --> 00:15:30,777
What are you looking at?
What are you looking at?

244
00:15:31,445 --> 00:15:33,988
- Tell that Mexican to shut up.
- Move. Move.

245
00:15:34,406 --> 00:15:35,448
You're sick.

246
00:15:37,701 --> 00:15:39,494
Stens.

247
00:15:39,745 --> 00:15:41,979
Stens. Hey. Hey. Come on. Come on.

248
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,247
Don't break it up.

249
00:15:43,832 --> 00:15:45,208
Get back. Get back.

250
00:15:45,667 --> 00:15:48,336
- Yeah, and fuck your mother.
- Fuck you.

251
00:15:51,006 --> 00:15:53,424
- Come on.
- Stop, officer. That's an order.

252
00:15:55,511 --> 00:15:57,095
Hey.

253
00:15:59,014 --> 00:16:00,890
Yeah, all right.

254
00:16:02,434 --> 00:16:04,936
- You're all going in my report.
- Let's go, Exley.

255
00:16:23,997 --> 00:16:25,373
"Bloody Christmas."

256
00:16:25,874 --> 00:16:28,417
The press love to label.

257
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:32,046
You should know this is
bigger than the police board.

258
00:16:32,214 --> 00:16:36,384
The grand jury's convening.
Indictments may be handed down.

259
00:16:36,718 --> 00:16:39,387
- Will you testify?
- No, sir. I won't.

260
00:16:42,558 --> 00:16:44,684
District Attorney Loew?

261
00:16:44,852 --> 00:16:48,688
You and Officer Stensland brought
the liquor to the station.

262
00:16:48,856 --> 00:16:51,190
Stensland was already drunk.

263
00:16:51,358 --> 00:16:54,235
Do you see how appearing as a
voluntary witness against him...

264
00:16:54,403 --> 00:16:56,988
could offset the damage
you've done to yourself?

265
00:16:57,156 --> 00:16:59,907
Sir, I won't testify against
my partner or anyone else.

266
00:17:00,075 --> 00:17:02,076
This man is a disgrace.

267
00:17:02,369 --> 00:17:06,080
Your badge and gun, officer.
You're suspended from duty.

268
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:09,458
Dismissed.

269
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:26,601
Ed.

270
00:17:26,768 --> 00:17:29,979
We need police witnesses to offset
the damage done to the department.

271
00:17:30,147 --> 00:17:32,523
- I'm asking you...
- Justice has to be served.

272
00:17:32,691 --> 00:17:34,275
Of course I'll testify.

273
00:17:37,362 --> 00:17:40,406
I'm glad you feel that way,
Edmund. Most of the men don't.

274
00:17:40,616 --> 00:17:43,284
They think silence and
integrity are the same thing.

275
00:17:43,702 --> 00:17:48,748
Not exactly the image of the new
L.A.P.D. we're trying to create.

276
00:17:48,957 --> 00:17:51,918
Welcome to Los Angeles,
the city of the future.

277
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,712
- May I make a suggestion, sir?
- By all means.

278
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,632
The public will expect the
department to protect its own...

279
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:01,135
and sweep this under
the carpet. Don't.

280
00:18:01,637 --> 00:18:04,597
Shift the guilt to men whose
pensions are secured.

281
00:18:04,765 --> 00:18:06,474
Force them to retire.

282
00:18:07,768 --> 00:18:13,147
But somebody has to swing, so
indict, try and convict...

283
00:18:13,315 --> 00:18:15,149
Richard Stensland and Bud White.

284
00:18:15,609 --> 00:18:19,153
Secure them jail time. The
message will be very clear:

285
00:18:19,738 --> 00:18:22,156
This department,
your new L.A.P.D...

286
00:18:22,324 --> 00:18:25,493
will not tolerate officers who
think they're above the law.

287
00:18:25,661 --> 00:18:28,704
Dick Stensland is an
embarrassment as a policeman.

288
00:18:28,914 --> 00:18:32,583
He's had rotten fitness reports
from every CO he's served under...

289
00:18:33,168 --> 00:18:35,169
but Bud White is a
valuable officer.

290
00:18:35,337 --> 00:18:37,004
White's a mindless thug.

291
00:18:37,172 --> 00:18:38,965
No, Edmund.

292
00:18:39,174 --> 00:18:41,231
He's just a man who
can answer "yes"

293
00:18:41,232 --> 00:18:43,177
to those questions I've asked you.

294
00:18:43,762 --> 00:18:46,764
The department and the
public need role models.

295
00:18:46,932 --> 00:18:50,017
Clean-cut, forthright men
the public can admire.

296
00:18:51,687 --> 00:18:54,772
Sergeant, I'll promote you...

297
00:18:55,023 --> 00:18:58,234
to lieutenant,
effective immediately.

298
00:18:58,402 --> 00:18:59,694
Detective lieutenant.

299
00:19:01,947 --> 00:19:03,572
Ed, you're 30.

300
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,493
Your father didn't make
lieutenant until he was 33.

301
00:19:07,661 --> 00:19:08,786
I know that, sir.

302
00:19:08,954 --> 00:19:11,664
I also know when he made
lieutenant, it was as a detective.

303
00:19:11,832 --> 00:19:14,250
Before we start polishing
our laurels...

304
00:19:14,459 --> 00:19:17,044
it'd look better if we had
a corroborative witness.

305
00:19:17,546 --> 00:19:21,007
That won't be easy to come by.
The men hate a stool pigeon.

306
00:19:21,216 --> 00:19:23,050
Jack Vincennes.

307
00:19:23,218 --> 00:19:25,970
He hit one of the Mexicans
and saw the whole thing.

308
00:19:26,138 --> 00:19:27,774
A veteran like Vincennes might be

309
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:29,807
willing to admit his
own culpability...

310
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:32,560
but he'd never rat out
a fellow officer.

311
00:19:33,228 --> 00:19:36,272
Jack's the technical adviser
on "Badge of Honour".

312
00:19:36,481 --> 00:19:37,815
He lives for it.

313
00:19:38,066 --> 00:19:39,734
That's the way to get to him.

314
00:19:43,196 --> 00:19:45,406
I'd like you to observe, Ed.

315
00:19:49,077 --> 00:19:50,661
Call Sergeant Vincennes.

316
00:19:51,413 --> 00:19:52,913
Bright kid.

317
00:19:53,081 --> 00:19:55,082
You may well reap
the benefit, Ed...

318
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,169
but are you prepared to be
despised in the department?

319
00:19:58,837 --> 00:20:00,254
Yes, sir, I am.

320
00:20:02,257 --> 00:20:03,257
So be it.

321
00:20:09,514 --> 00:20:11,849
Well, sergeant, we'll
get right to it.

322
00:20:12,351 --> 00:20:14,606
Nine civilian witnesses
have identified

323
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:16,354
you as hitting Ezekiel Garcia.

324
00:20:16,521 --> 00:20:18,939
But we have a stellar witness
who will name names...

325
00:20:19,107 --> 00:20:22,735
and also testify that you hit
back only after being hit.

326
00:20:22,903 --> 00:20:23,906
And?

327
00:20:23,907 --> 00:20:26,113
And you will testify
against three officers...

328
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:28,240
who have already earned
their pension...

329
00:20:28,408 --> 00:20:31,035
and plead ignorance to
questions at the other men.

330
00:20:31,453 --> 00:20:33,454
No, thanks. I'm not a snitch.

331
00:20:33,622 --> 00:20:37,124
I'll guarantee you a slap on the
wrist, a brief suspension...

332
00:20:37,292 --> 00:20:40,628
followed by a temporary transfer
from Narcotics to Vice.

333
00:20:40,962 --> 00:20:43,714
When you transfer out of Vice,
you'll be back on the show.

334
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,762
The show?

335
00:20:50,305 --> 00:20:51,972
"Badge of Honour," Vincennes.

336
00:20:53,558 --> 00:20:56,394
We need to tone down
your profile for a bit.

337
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,646
Jack...

338
00:20:58,814 --> 00:21:03,109
I doubt you've ever taken a
stupid breath. Don't start now.

339
00:21:03,652 --> 00:21:04,944
Okay, I'll do it.

340
00:21:08,323 --> 00:21:11,075
The grand jury will hear
your testimony tomorrow.

341
00:21:11,243 --> 00:21:12,660
Dismissed, Vincennes.

342
00:21:23,922 --> 00:21:25,923
And so it goes...

343
00:21:26,341 --> 00:21:28,175
detective lieutenant.

344
00:21:29,928 --> 00:21:32,430
Ace them at the grand
jury tomorrow, son.

345
00:21:32,681 --> 00:21:35,433
Wear a smart-looking
suit and ace them.

346
00:21:36,351 --> 00:21:39,353
And, Ed, lose the glasses.

347
00:21:49,698 --> 00:21:52,450
So you're the stellar witness.

348
00:21:52,701 --> 00:21:56,287
I should have known. What's
the chief throwing you?

349
00:21:56,663 --> 00:21:59,790
- Throwing me?
- Yeah, Exley, what's the pay-off?

350
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:01,959
You're the pay-off expert.

351
00:22:02,377 --> 00:22:03,419
I'm just doing my duty.

352
00:22:03,628 --> 00:22:07,173
Come on, you're playing an angle
here, college boy, right?

353
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:10,509
You're getting something so you
don't have to hobnob with cops...

354
00:22:10,677 --> 00:22:12,511
who are gonna hate
you for snitching.

355
00:22:12,888 --> 00:22:15,473
Well, if they're making
you detective, watch out.

356
00:22:15,974 --> 00:22:17,892
Some bureau guys are
gonna burn in this...

357
00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:20,227
and you're gonna work
with friends of theirs.

358
00:22:20,395 --> 00:22:21,812
What about you?

359
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,289
I'm snitching three
old-timers who'll

360
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,233
be fishing in Oregon next week.

361
00:22:26,568 --> 00:22:28,486
Next to you, I'm clean...

362
00:22:28,737 --> 00:22:29,904
and smart.

363
00:22:30,071 --> 00:22:32,740
Edmund J. Exley to chambers.

364
00:22:35,076 --> 00:22:36,118
And remember...

365
00:22:36,328 --> 00:22:38,082
Bud White will fuck
you for this if

366
00:22:38,083 --> 00:22:39,788
it takes him the rest of his life.

367
00:22:43,668 --> 00:22:45,252
Captain, what do you want?

368
00:22:46,421 --> 00:22:47,671
Call me Dudley.

369
00:22:48,173 --> 00:22:51,342
Dudley, what do you want?

370
00:22:52,594 --> 00:22:56,096
Look, lad, I admire your
refusal to testify...

371
00:22:56,515 --> 00:22:58,516
and your loyalty to your partner.

372
00:22:59,017 --> 00:23:00,976
I admire you as a policeman...

373
00:23:01,186 --> 00:23:03,543
particularly your
adherence to violence

374
00:23:03,544 --> 00:23:05,606
as a necessary adjunct to the job.

375
00:23:05,774 --> 00:23:09,026
And I'm most impressed with your
punishment of women-beaters.

376
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,278
Do you hate them, Wendell?

377
00:23:13,865 --> 00:23:15,032
What do you want?

378
00:23:19,538 --> 00:23:20,955
They're yours.

379
00:23:22,374 --> 00:23:24,208
Go ahead, take them.

380
00:23:26,878 --> 00:23:28,337
There's no goddamn bill on me?

381
00:23:28,547 --> 00:23:30,485
Four witnesses recanted
their testimony.

382
00:23:30,486 --> 00:23:31,486
Why?

383
00:23:31,487 --> 00:23:33,634
- They had a change of heart.
- What about Stensland?

384
00:23:34,135 --> 00:23:35,719
Your partner's through.

385
00:23:35,971 --> 00:23:38,097
Departmental scapegoat
on the chief's orders.

386
00:23:38,265 --> 00:23:40,224
A year from his pension.

387
00:23:43,311 --> 00:23:44,353
Exley.

388
00:23:44,521 --> 00:23:46,605
Exley made his play and
got what he wanted.

389
00:23:46,773 --> 00:23:50,150
As a politician, he
exceeds even myself.

390
00:23:50,986 --> 00:23:53,821
The department needs
smart men like Exley...

391
00:23:54,322 --> 00:23:57,575
and direct men like you.

392
00:23:58,994 --> 00:24:01,047
Look, lad, I need you
for an assignment

393
00:24:01,048 --> 00:24:02,997
the chief's given
me the go-ahead on.

394
00:24:03,164 --> 00:24:07,459
A duty few men are fit for,
but you were born for.

395
00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:10,796
You'd be working out of
Homicide down at City Hall.

396
00:24:11,006 --> 00:24:12,172
Homicide?

397
00:24:13,174 --> 00:24:14,675
Working cases?

398
00:24:15,844 --> 00:24:18,429
Your talents lie
elsewhere, Wendell.

399
00:24:19,014 --> 00:24:20,639
It's a muscle job.

400
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:27,021
You'll do as I say and ask no
questions. Do you follow my drift?

401
00:24:27,272 --> 00:24:29,356
In Technicolor, sir.

402
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,903
Meet Tony Brancato and
Anthony Trombino...

403
00:24:35,113 --> 00:24:38,407
two rising lieutenants in
the Mickey Cohen rackets.

404
00:24:38,617 --> 00:24:40,659
With the dapper little
gent in prison...

405
00:24:40,827 --> 00:24:45,039
who knows how far they'll
go? The sky's the limit.

406
00:24:51,671 --> 00:24:52,713
Oh, well.

407
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:10,272
Meet Deuce Perkins, Mickey
Cohen's narcotics lieutenant.

408
00:25:10,482 --> 00:25:11,899
Could he be behind the hits?

409
00:25:12,651 --> 00:25:15,486
Is he consolidating
organised-crime power?

410
00:25:21,576 --> 00:25:23,243
I suppose not.

411
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,292
One thing's for sure:

412
00:25:30,502 --> 00:25:33,754
Two-man triggers are punching the
tickets on the Mickster's muscle.

413
00:25:44,432 --> 00:25:47,017
Meanwhile, rumour has
it the L.A.P.D...

414
00:25:47,185 --> 00:25:49,474
has set up a
not-so-welcome waggon to

415
00:25:49,475 --> 00:25:52,064
dishearten out-of-town
criminal element...

416
00:25:52,273 --> 00:25:55,567
from filling the void
left by Mickey's absence.

417
00:25:55,777 --> 00:25:58,696
When I know more, dear
readers, so will you.

418
00:25:58,947 --> 00:26:01,615
Off the record, on the Q.T...

419
00:26:02,033 --> 00:26:05,619
and very hushush.

420
00:26:06,788 --> 00:26:10,791
With Mickey Cohen in prison, Los
Angeles is organised-crime free.

421
00:26:11,126 --> 00:26:12,876
The chief wants to
keep it that way.

422
00:26:14,254 --> 00:26:17,214
Now, in Cleveland, you're an
organised-crime associate...

423
00:26:17,382 --> 00:26:21,218
in desperate needs of re-education
in the ways of polite society.

424
00:26:23,638 --> 00:26:25,431
I hear things.

425
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,599
Like those two-man shooter teams.

426
00:26:27,809 --> 00:26:29,774
Bang, bang. They're
eighty-sixing Cohen's

427
00:26:29,775 --> 00:26:31,645
lieutenants. Tell me,
what do you want?

428
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,231
We want you to go home.

429
00:26:38,987 --> 00:26:40,612
Picture-book smut, gentlemen.

430
00:26:40,822 --> 00:26:44,491
There's been a bunch of this found
at collateral crime scenes lately.

431
00:26:44,743 --> 00:26:49,788
Quality ranges from piss-poor
to very well done.

432
00:26:50,707 --> 00:26:53,417
- Look who's back from suspension.
- Here, Jack.

433
00:26:53,585 --> 00:26:55,627
We're honoured, Sergeant Jack.

434
00:26:55,837 --> 00:26:59,256
Ah, look at that. The great
jerk-off case of 1953.

435
00:26:59,591 --> 00:27:01,800
There some place you'd
rather be, Vincennes?

436
00:27:02,343 --> 00:27:05,512
Yeah, working Narcotics,
looking for Cohen's missing H.

437
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,892
Yeah, finding 25 pounds of heroin
would get you plenty of ink.

438
00:27:10,101 --> 00:27:12,561
Maybe you should've thought of
that before "Bloody Christmas."

439
00:27:12,729 --> 00:27:13,854
Oh.

440
00:27:14,272 --> 00:27:16,190
Make a major case, sergeant.

441
00:27:16,357 --> 00:27:18,859
It's the only way you're
getting out of here.

442
00:27:19,611 --> 00:27:21,028
Dismissed, gentlemen.

443
00:27:29,204 --> 00:27:31,163
Go get the facts, Jack.

444
00:27:31,372 --> 00:27:33,207
Just the facts.

445
00:27:40,715 --> 00:27:42,257
Whatever you desire.

446
00:27:42,467 --> 00:27:45,219
Hi. I'd like to get a
delivery to Beverly Hills.

447
00:27:45,428 --> 00:27:46,512
I don't know you.

448
00:27:47,055 --> 00:27:48,723
Well, a friend just
gave me this number

449
00:27:48,724 --> 00:27:50,224
and I just wanted
to find out if...

450
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,610
Ginger, you grab a
reverse directory

451
00:27:54,611 --> 00:27:56,605
and shag a name and
address for me?

452
00:27:56,815 --> 00:27:58,732
Crestview 2239.

453
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,325
Hush-Hush, off the
record, on the Q.T.

454
00:28:08,743 --> 00:28:10,494
Sid, it's Vincennes.

455
00:28:10,662 --> 00:28:14,081
Jackie. Hey, you back on
Narco? I need some good copy.

456
00:28:14,249 --> 00:28:16,333
No, but I do have something
going with Vice.

457
00:28:16,501 --> 00:28:18,126
Something juicy for the Sidster?

458
00:28:18,336 --> 00:28:20,587
Tracking porn. Arty,
high-class stuff.

459
00:28:20,755 --> 00:28:22,454
What do you know
about Fleur-de-Lis?

460
00:28:22,455 --> 00:28:23,924
Slogan's "Whatever you desire."

461
00:28:24,092 --> 00:28:25,717
No, I've heard bupkes.

462
00:28:25,927 --> 00:28:29,596
Get me some Narco skinny. I want
to do an all-hophead issue.

463
00:28:29,764 --> 00:28:33,684
Shvartze jazz musicians and
movie stars. You like it?

464
00:28:33,852 --> 00:28:36,186
Yeah, I'll talk to you
later, Sid. What do you got?

465
00:28:36,354 --> 00:28:39,439
- Number's not assigned, sergeant.
- Thanks, Ginger.

466
00:28:41,276 --> 00:28:42,609
A bootleg.

467
00:28:49,576 --> 00:28:51,118
Hey.

468
00:28:51,703 --> 00:28:52,911
Take it easy.

469
00:28:53,121 --> 00:28:54,580
Tough break, Stens.

470
00:28:54,789 --> 00:28:56,915
Good man. We're gonna
miss you around here.

471
00:28:57,125 --> 00:28:58,792
Raw deal, Stensland.

472
00:29:02,088 --> 00:29:03,964
Here comes the snitch.

473
00:29:15,143 --> 00:29:16,768
Sorry about that, lieutenant.

474
00:29:33,745 --> 00:29:35,579
Stay out of trouble, Bud.

475
00:29:38,082 --> 00:29:40,292
I got a couple hours.
I'll buy you a drink.

476
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,086
Rain check. No, I got a hot date.

477
00:29:42,087 --> 00:29:43,087
Come on.

478
00:29:43,588 --> 00:29:46,840
Yeah? Who is she and what
did you arrest her for?

479
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,717
It's confidential.

480
00:29:48,927 --> 00:29:53,847
Like that magazine that
Vincennes scams for. Hush-Hush.

481
00:29:55,016 --> 00:29:56,850
I'll see you later in the week.

482
00:29:57,435 --> 00:29:59,394
We'll do the town, on me.

483
00:29:59,604 --> 00:30:02,606
Yeah. I'll bring my
wallet just in case.

484
00:30:06,861 --> 00:30:09,112
- See you tomorrow.
- Hang on a minute.

485
00:30:09,948 --> 00:30:11,365
I'll walk down with you.

486
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:22,709
Punk kid. Who the hell
is he trying to impress?

487
00:30:23,628 --> 00:30:27,381
- Yeah, I wonder.
- Got himself a real career going.

488
00:30:31,636 --> 00:30:34,054
Sergeant Williams,
pick up, please.

489
00:30:35,223 --> 00:30:36,890
Sergeant Williams?

490
00:30:40,144 --> 00:30:42,980
Is there anybody up
there in Homicide?

491
00:30:43,982 --> 00:30:45,565
Anybody there?

492
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:49,027
Lieutenant Exley.

493
00:30:49,237 --> 00:30:51,196
You've got a homicide downtown.

494
00:30:51,406 --> 00:30:55,659
- The Nite Owl Coffee Shop.
- I got it. It's mine.

495
00:31:07,255 --> 00:31:10,048
Sir, at least one person's
dead. I stopped for coffee.

496
00:31:10,258 --> 00:31:12,592
No one comes through the
front door. Understand?

497
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,469
Yes, sir.

498
00:32:49,315 --> 00:32:51,983
I want barricades at both ends
of the street. Make sure...

499
00:32:52,151 --> 00:32:55,612
Sir? I took the
call. It's my case.

500
00:32:56,197 --> 00:32:58,448
You don't want it, Edmund,
and you can't have it.

501
00:32:58,616 --> 00:33:01,660
- I took the call.
- It's mine.

502
00:33:02,036 --> 00:33:03,370
I'll make you my
second-in-command.

503
00:33:03,538 --> 00:33:05,372
Captain Smith? Over here, please.

504
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:08,375
- The back door.
- Nobody else inside.

505
00:33:10,211 --> 00:33:12,546
Looks like the cook drew a
handgun and set it off.

506
00:33:12,713 --> 00:33:14,631
The rest were killed
in the men's room.

507
00:33:19,137 --> 00:33:20,303
Sir...

508
00:33:20,555 --> 00:33:24,307
we got a total of 15 spent
12-gauge Remington shotgun shells.

509
00:33:24,475 --> 00:33:26,803
I'm betting three men,
five-shot capacity

510
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:28,687
pumps, all of them emptying once.

511
00:33:28,855 --> 00:33:31,815
Excuse me, sir, we got an
ID on one of the victims.

512
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,817
It's Dick Stensland.

513
00:33:36,404 --> 00:33:38,947
When I first saw her, I thought
she was Rita Hayworth.

514
00:33:39,157 --> 00:33:40,574
Yeah, me too.

515
00:33:50,293 --> 00:33:52,419
Hell of a way to avoid
a prison sentence.

516
00:34:03,097 --> 00:34:04,389
You tell me what happened?

517
00:34:04,932 --> 00:34:07,517
Appears three men held
up a coffee shop.

518
00:34:07,727 --> 00:34:10,562
The guy at the register pulled
a .38, so they killed him.

519
00:34:11,063 --> 00:34:14,441
Then they took everyone else
out back and killed them too.

520
00:34:15,735 --> 00:34:18,778
Lieutenant, we're ready
with that Nite Owl ID.

521
00:34:24,285 --> 00:34:26,244
Is this your daughter,
Mrs Lefferts?

522
00:34:26,954 --> 00:34:28,622
I don't know.

523
00:34:29,415 --> 00:34:32,083
We know this is difficult.
Just take your time.

524
00:34:33,794 --> 00:34:36,129
It seems like my Susan...

525
00:34:36,297 --> 00:34:39,257
but my Susan was a
blond, not a redhead.

526
00:34:39,425 --> 00:34:41,301
When was the last
time you saw her?

527
00:34:41,761 --> 00:34:43,762
Just before Christmas.

528
00:34:44,305 --> 00:34:47,224
We'd fought. I didn't
like her boyfriend.

529
00:34:47,808 --> 00:34:49,843
Mrs Lefferts, does
your daughter have

530
00:34:49,844 --> 00:34:51,770
any distinguishing
characteristics?

531
00:34:52,813 --> 00:34:55,774
You got the wrong idea,
mister. I'm fine.

532
00:34:56,609 --> 00:34:59,778
She has a birthmark on her hip.

533
00:35:05,618 --> 00:35:07,160
It's her.

534
00:35:07,828 --> 00:35:09,955
My baby.

535
00:35:13,167 --> 00:35:15,001
I'm sorry, Mrs Lefferts.

536
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:18,588
Who's in charge of
this investigation?

537
00:35:19,006 --> 00:35:20,507
Captain Smith and myself. Why?

538
00:35:23,177 --> 00:35:24,594
"The Nite Owl Massacre."

539
00:35:24,762 --> 00:35:26,554
Hyperbole aside...

540
00:35:26,764 --> 00:35:30,433
this is a heinous crime that
requires swift resolution.

541
00:35:31,352 --> 00:35:32,477
Six victims.

542
00:35:32,687 --> 00:35:35,355
One of them one of our
own. Dick Stensland.

543
00:35:35,523 --> 00:35:37,844
As it happens, he was
a Nite Owl regular,

544
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:39,943
in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

545
00:35:40,361 --> 00:35:42,320
Robbery is the likely motive.

546
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:44,614
We have rubber-glove
smears on the register...

547
00:35:44,782 --> 00:35:48,743
and preliminary forensics strongly
tend towards a trio of shooters.

548
00:35:48,911 --> 00:35:50,954
We do have one hot
lead, so listen well.

549
00:35:51,372 --> 00:35:53,331
Three Negro juveniles...

550
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:57,168
were seen discharging shotguns
last night in Griffith Park.

551
00:35:57,378 --> 00:36:01,423
A park ranger ID'd them as driving
a 1948 to 1950 Mercury coupe...

552
00:36:01,632 --> 00:36:03,008
maroon in colour.

553
00:36:03,467 --> 00:36:07,178
An hour ago, a canvassing crew
turned up a news vendor...

554
00:36:07,346 --> 00:36:09,311
who saw a maroon
Merc parked across

555
00:36:09,312 --> 00:36:11,057
from the Nite Owl around 1 a.m.

556
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:15,353
DMV has come up with a
registration list of Merc coupes.

557
00:36:16,564 --> 00:36:21,067
Forty-eight two-man teams will
shake three names apiece.

558
00:36:21,736 --> 00:36:24,362
Interrogations will be led
by Lieutenant Edmund Exley.

559
00:36:27,825 --> 00:36:29,576
Enough on that.

560
00:36:32,413 --> 00:36:36,082
Gentlemen, just go out and get
them. Use all necessary force.

561
00:36:37,209 --> 00:36:39,419
The people of Los
Angeles demand it.

562
00:36:40,046 --> 00:36:41,379
Dismissed.

563
00:36:44,759 --> 00:36:46,760
Why not just put a bounty on them?

564
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,352
You ready to roll?

565
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:57,270
Take them. I got
something I gotta do.

566
00:36:57,438 --> 00:37:01,107
- What if one of these names...?
- Get somebody else.

567
00:37:01,942 --> 00:37:04,194
Well, I got our
assignments, Big V.

568
00:37:04,403 --> 00:37:07,447
We go by this list, we got zero
chance of making this collar.

569
00:37:07,615 --> 00:37:10,283
I got a guy who knows what's
going on south of Jefferson.

570
00:37:10,451 --> 00:37:13,745
- He can put us at fifty-fifty.
- Jack, what are you doing?

571
00:37:14,205 --> 00:37:16,790
Same sort of thing that got
you in trouble last time.

572
00:37:16,957 --> 00:37:18,416
I'll take those odds.

573
00:37:22,463 --> 00:37:23,963
We got it from here.

574
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:28,635
Between the two of you, you
should bring a photographer.

575
00:37:33,641 --> 00:37:37,143
I need an address on a customer
of yours. Her name is Lynn.

576
00:37:37,311 --> 00:37:39,145
- That's all I got to go on?
- Yeah.

577
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,981
I think you already know who
I mean, so cough it up.

578
00:37:42,316 --> 00:37:45,485
There's a billing address
and a delivery address.

579
00:38:12,179 --> 00:38:13,972
Are you Pierce Patchett?

580
00:38:15,015 --> 00:38:16,349
I am.

581
00:38:18,352 --> 00:38:20,579
Are you soliciting for
police charities?

582
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,480
Last time you called at my office.

583
00:38:22,857 --> 00:38:25,817
Go on down to the driveway.
We'll talk there.

584
00:38:36,829 --> 00:38:38,371
What can I do for you?

585
00:38:39,373 --> 00:38:43,001
- Where were you last night?
- I was here hosting a party.

586
00:38:44,712 --> 00:38:48,840
- Tell me about Dick Stensland.
- I don't know him, Mr ...?

587
00:38:49,175 --> 00:38:50,550
Officer White.

588
00:38:51,635 --> 00:38:52,886
Sue Lefferts? You know her?

589
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,513
You know I do. You
saw me with her.

590
00:38:57,224 --> 00:38:58,892
How did you find me?

591
00:38:59,518 --> 00:39:03,688
Nick's Liquor. This is where
Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.

592
00:39:03,898 --> 00:39:05,523
Of course.

593
00:39:08,402 --> 00:39:10,570
Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl.

594
00:39:11,197 --> 00:39:12,864
I'm investigating.

595
00:39:15,034 --> 00:39:18,912
- Everything all right?
- Fine, Phillip. Thank you.

596
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:25,668
What happened to the
other guy, Buzz?

597
00:39:25,836 --> 00:39:28,254
Buzz Meeks no longer works for me.

598
00:39:28,422 --> 00:39:31,007
Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas
Eve but didn't act it.

599
00:39:31,175 --> 00:39:34,177
I think she'd been hit in the face
with a tennis racket. She is...

600
00:39:34,345 --> 00:39:36,930
Was a big doubles fan.

601
00:39:37,765 --> 00:39:40,767
You're a known associate of a
woman killed in a mass murder.

602
00:39:41,602 --> 00:39:44,062
Wanna go downtown and
discuss this officially?

603
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,939
Is that what this is? Official?

604
00:39:46,732 --> 00:39:51,277
Somehow I have the feeling this is
more personal with you, Mr White.

605
00:39:54,573 --> 00:39:56,074
All right, then...

606
00:39:56,909 --> 00:39:59,285
are you concerned about
criminal matters

607
00:39:59,286 --> 00:40:01,371
peripheral to the
Nite Owl murders?

608
00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:02,560
Not at the moment.

609
00:40:02,561 --> 00:40:04,958
You wouldn't feel
obligated to report them?

610
00:40:07,294 --> 00:40:09,462
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?

611
00:40:09,797 --> 00:40:12,632
I needed a Rita Hayworth to
fill out my little studio.

612
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,967
What little studio?

613
00:40:14,134 --> 00:40:17,804
Well, there's Gardner,
Russell, Monroe, Turner...

614
00:40:17,972 --> 00:40:20,306
Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.

615
00:40:20,808 --> 00:40:23,309
I use girls that look
like movie stars.

616
00:40:23,477 --> 00:40:26,104
Sometimes I employ
a plastic surgeon.

617
00:40:26,647 --> 00:40:29,107
When the work had been done,
that's when you saw us.

618
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,651
That's why her mother
couldn't ID her.

619
00:40:33,279 --> 00:40:34,737
Jesus fucking Christ.

620
00:40:34,947 --> 00:40:36,990
No, Mr White, Pierce
Morehouse Patchett.

621
00:40:39,326 --> 00:40:41,172
I sense you're on
your best behaviour,

622
00:40:41,173 --> 00:40:42,829
but that's all I'm gonna tell you.

623
00:40:43,205 --> 00:40:45,331
If you persist, I'll meet
you with my attorney.

624
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:48,668
Now, would you like
Lynn Bracken's address?

625
00:40:48,836 --> 00:40:50,503
I got her address.

626
00:40:51,797 --> 00:40:53,840
Find Susan's killer, Mr White.

627
00:40:54,341 --> 00:40:56,467
I'll give you a handsome reward.

628
00:41:01,807 --> 00:41:03,891
Whatever you desire.

629
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:12,942
Come on. I know you're not asleep.

630
00:41:15,362 --> 00:41:17,363
You talking to me?
What do you want?

631
00:41:17,531 --> 00:41:19,198
My 5 bucks.

632
00:41:19,366 --> 00:41:21,826
It was the only one I had.

633
00:41:22,036 --> 00:41:23,202
Right now?

634
00:41:23,704 --> 00:41:26,205
Hey, doll face, tell
him to leave us alone.

635
00:41:26,373 --> 00:41:28,708
I understand. Okay, fine.

636
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:31,377
Oh, baby...

637
00:41:32,671 --> 00:41:34,047
bad news.

638
00:41:34,214 --> 00:41:35,381
You have to go.

639
00:41:35,549 --> 00:41:36,716
Go?

640
00:41:37,051 --> 00:41:39,719
Something very important has
come up and you have to go...

641
00:41:39,887 --> 00:41:42,639
but I'll make it up to you, okay?

642
00:41:44,016 --> 00:41:45,391
I will, I promise. Excuse me.

643
00:41:47,895 --> 00:41:49,354
Is it the cops?

644
00:41:53,901 --> 00:41:56,402
Miss Bracken, I'm Officer White.

645
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:59,197
I've been expecting you,
just not this soon.

646
00:41:59,365 --> 00:42:02,075
Pierce called. He told
me what happened to Sue.

647
00:42:02,242 --> 00:42:05,411
Everything all right, doll?
Want me to get rid of him?

648
00:42:05,746 --> 00:42:07,580
Hit the road, pal.

649
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:10,541
Maybe I will...

650
00:42:11,085 --> 00:42:12,543
maybe I won't.

651
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,804
L.A.P.D., shit-bird.
Get out of here or

652
00:42:14,805 --> 00:42:16,547
I'll call your wife
to come get you.

653
00:42:33,107 --> 00:42:34,691
- Officer.
- Councilman.

654
00:42:53,293 --> 00:42:56,796
- Would you care for a drink?
- Yeah, Scotch straight.

655
00:43:02,594 --> 00:43:06,264
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts,
but we weren't friends.

656
00:43:06,598 --> 00:43:07,932
You know what I mean?

657
00:43:08,308 --> 00:43:09,976
You sorry she's dead?

658
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:13,271
Of course I am.

659
00:43:13,605 --> 00:43:15,481
What kind of question is that?

660
00:43:17,651 --> 00:43:19,944
Do you know why Pierce
is humouring you?

661
00:43:20,154 --> 00:43:22,488
Use words like that,
you might make me mad.

662
00:43:22,823 --> 00:43:25,450
- But do you know?
- Yeah, I know.

663
00:43:26,452 --> 00:43:31,581
Patchett's running whores cut
to look like movie stars.

664
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:33,724
And judging by his
address, probably

665
00:43:33,725 --> 00:43:35,293
something bigger on the side.

666
00:43:35,461 --> 00:43:37,336
He doesn't want any attention.

667
00:43:37,629 --> 00:43:41,174
That's right. Our motives are
selfish, so we're cooperating.

668
00:43:41,341 --> 00:43:44,260
So cooperate. Why was Susan
Lefferts at the Nite Owl?

669
00:43:44,678 --> 00:43:47,305
I don't know. I never heard
of the Nite Owl till today.

670
00:43:47,473 --> 00:43:50,433
- How did she meet Patchett?
- Pierce meets people.

671
00:43:50,642 --> 00:43:52,813
Sue came on a bus with
dreams of Hollywood

672
00:43:52,814 --> 00:43:54,479
and this is how they turned out.

673
00:43:55,022 --> 00:43:58,858
Thanks to Pierce, we still
get to act a little.

674
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,694
Tell me about Pierce.

675
00:44:02,029 --> 00:44:04,113
He's waiting for you
to mention money.

676
00:44:05,324 --> 00:44:07,685
You want some advice,
Miss Bracken?

677
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:08,686
It's Lynn.

678
00:44:08,869 --> 00:44:13,331
Miss Bracken, don't ever try to
fucking bribe me or threaten me...

679
00:44:13,499 --> 00:44:16,125
or I'll have you and Patchett
in shit up to your ears.

680
00:44:17,211 --> 00:44:19,670
I remember you from Christmas Eve.

681
00:44:20,881 --> 00:44:24,050
You have a thing for helping
women, don't you, Officer White?

682
00:44:24,885 --> 00:44:26,677
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.

683
00:44:27,012 --> 00:44:30,348
- You say "fuck" a lot.
- You fuck for money.

684
00:44:30,557 --> 00:44:34,185
There's blood on your shirt. Is
that an integral part of your job?

685
00:44:34,353 --> 00:44:36,062
- Yeah.
- Do you enjoy it?

686
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:38,981
- When they deserve it.
- Did they deserve it today?

687
00:44:40,692 --> 00:44:41,734
I'm not sure.

688
00:44:41,902 --> 00:44:43,402
- But you did it anyway.
- Yeah.

689
00:44:44,196 --> 00:44:46,405
Just like the half-dozen
guys you screwed today.

690
00:44:47,699 --> 00:44:49,742
Well, actually, it was only two.

691
00:44:52,204 --> 00:44:54,163
You're different, Officer White.

692
00:44:54,331 --> 00:44:56,519
You're the first man
in five years who

693
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,876
didn't tell me I look
like Veronica Lake.

694
00:44:59,044 --> 00:45:00,837
You look better
than Veronica Lake.

695
00:45:06,385 --> 00:45:07,426
Pierce Patchett?

696
00:45:09,096 --> 00:45:11,931
He takes a cut of our earnings
and invests it for us.

697
00:45:12,099 --> 00:45:15,268
He doesn't let us use narcotics
and he doesn't abuse us.

698
00:45:15,602 --> 00:45:19,772
Can your policeman's mentality
grasp those contradictions?

699
00:45:21,608 --> 00:45:23,943
He had you cut to look
like Veronica Lake.

700
00:45:24,111 --> 00:45:25,570
No.

701
00:45:25,737 --> 00:45:28,906
I'm really a brunette,
but the rest is me.

702
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:33,077
And that's all the news
that's fit to print.

703
00:45:34,288 --> 00:45:36,706
It was nice meeting you, officer.

704
00:45:40,961 --> 00:45:42,416
I'd like to see you again.

705
00:45:42,417 --> 00:45:44,755
You asking for a date,
or an appointment?

706
00:45:46,758 --> 00:45:48,050
I don't know.

707
00:45:48,218 --> 00:45:50,839
For a date, I should
know your first name.

708
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:51,888
Forget I asked.

709
00:45:52,931 --> 00:45:54,432
It was a mistake.

710
00:46:14,995 --> 00:46:16,454
Leonard Bidwell?

711
00:46:17,623 --> 00:46:19,624
Come on down here and talk to us.

712
00:46:21,668 --> 00:46:24,587
- How's the left these days?
- What's it to you?

713
00:46:24,755 --> 00:46:28,466
Oh, I saw you fight Kid
Gavilan. I like your style.

714
00:46:30,969 --> 00:46:32,845
What do you want, Mr Policeman?

715
00:46:33,639 --> 00:46:36,182
You got a brother in Folsom.
I know, I put him there.

716
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:37,433
Until 19-fucking-70.

717
00:46:37,643 --> 00:46:39,685
How'd you like to make it 1960?

718
00:46:39,978 --> 00:46:42,355
I know the judge, and
Lieutenant Exley here...

719
00:46:42,522 --> 00:46:44,690
is very good friends with the DA.

720
00:46:45,692 --> 00:46:47,068
Yeah.

721
00:46:47,235 --> 00:46:50,696
We're looking for three coloured
guys who like to pop off shotguns.

722
00:46:50,864 --> 00:46:53,032
One owns a maroon Mercury coupe.

723
00:46:53,367 --> 00:46:56,535
- Wanna give me a snitch jacket?
- Wanna buy your brother 10 years?

724
00:46:56,703 --> 00:46:58,621
- It was 10 years, right?
- Yeah, 10 years.

725
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:02,041
You don't have to say anything,
just look at this list...

726
00:47:02,376 --> 00:47:03,876
and point.

727
00:47:06,213 --> 00:47:08,214
He's bad, so I'll just tell you.

728
00:47:08,674 --> 00:47:10,049
Sugar Ray Collins.

729
00:47:10,217 --> 00:47:12,510
Drives a maroon '49 coupe.

730
00:47:13,011 --> 00:47:14,679
Beautiful ride.

731
00:47:15,347 --> 00:47:19,558
Don't know about shotguns, but he
gets his thrills killing dogs.

732
00:47:19,851 --> 00:47:21,143
He's righteous trash.

733
00:47:21,561 --> 00:47:24,730
Look at that. It's five
minutes from here. Thanks.

734
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,401
So I'll hear from you, right?

735
00:47:29,403 --> 00:47:33,364
- About my brother?
- Keep it up, Lenny. Up.

736
00:47:39,371 --> 00:47:41,664
There it is. It's in the back.

737
00:47:58,932 --> 00:48:01,559
- One of ours.
- Shit, somebody beat us here.

738
00:48:07,607 --> 00:48:09,191
- Damn it.
- What?

739
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:12,278
- My glasses.
- You're kidding.

740
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:15,781
Well, just don't shoot me.

741
00:48:24,583 --> 00:48:26,417
What are you guys doing here?

742
00:48:27,419 --> 00:48:29,128
We were just in the neighbourhood.

743
00:48:29,296 --> 00:48:30,296
What do you got?

744
00:48:30,464 --> 00:48:32,079
Three 12-gauge pumps, an empty box

745
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,883
of double-aught buck,
and some cash.

746
00:48:36,219 --> 00:48:38,971
So long, Vice. "Badge of
Honour," here I come.

747
00:48:39,139 --> 00:48:41,516
Fuck you, Vincennes.
This is our collar.

748
00:48:41,517 --> 00:48:42,517
Quiet.

749
00:48:42,518 --> 00:48:46,145
I'm ranking officer here. We
go as a team. End of story.

750
00:48:51,443 --> 00:48:52,485
Yeah, right.

751
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:57,448
- How many ways in?
- Only one. Up the stairs.

752
00:48:58,825 --> 00:49:00,826
He's very serious.

753
00:49:15,342 --> 00:49:17,510
- Police.
- Don't shoot.

754
00:49:17,677 --> 00:49:19,261
No.

755
00:49:19,429 --> 00:49:20,679
- Don't move.
- Ace him, Jack.

756
00:49:20,847 --> 00:49:23,182
- Shut up.
- Anxious, aren't you?

757
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:24,475
Don't kill them.

758
00:49:26,061 --> 00:49:29,313
- Hey.
- Back, back, back.

759
00:49:29,481 --> 00:49:30,600
Man, get off me.

760
00:49:30,601 --> 00:49:33,025
Against the wall.
Against the wall.

761
00:49:33,193 --> 00:49:35,528
- Put your hands up.
- Get over there. Come on.

762
00:49:36,655 --> 00:49:38,489
Now, shut up. Hands
behind your back.

763
00:49:39,658 --> 00:49:40,699
So...

764
00:49:41,326 --> 00:49:44,036
how's it feel getting
out of the office?

765
00:49:50,043 --> 00:49:51,710
This just came up from Forensics.

766
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,379
"Burning clothes.

767
00:49:54,589 --> 00:49:56,715
Casitas Youth Camp ..."

768
00:50:00,095 --> 00:50:04,306
- it's crowded in here, White.
- These guys killed Stensland.

769
00:50:20,907 --> 00:50:23,742
Ejection marks on the shells
from the suspects' shotguns...

770
00:50:23,910 --> 00:50:27,079
are identical to the marks on the
shell casings at the Nite Owl.

771
00:50:27,414 --> 00:50:29,415
I want confessions, Edmund.

772
00:50:29,583 --> 00:50:32,585
A night's stewing ought
to have softened them up.

773
00:50:33,003 --> 00:50:34,753
Oh, I'll break them, sir.

774
00:50:54,774 --> 00:50:57,776
Are you sure Golden Boy
is up to the task, cap?

775
00:50:58,445 --> 00:51:01,447
Oh, I think you'd be surprised
what the lad is capable of.

776
00:51:03,783 --> 00:51:05,743
You're 22. Aren't you, Ray?

777
00:51:11,208 --> 00:51:12,958
Did one of the officers
work you over?

778
00:51:15,378 --> 00:51:18,297
- You're 22, right?
- Why do you keep asking that?

779
00:51:18,465 --> 00:51:20,883
Twenty-two makes it a
gas-chamber bounce.

780
00:51:21,301 --> 00:51:23,761
You should've pulled
this caper years ago.

781
00:51:23,929 --> 00:51:27,139
Get life, do a little
Youth Authority jolt...

782
00:51:27,307 --> 00:51:29,225
transfer to Folsom a big man.

783
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:31,123
Get yourself a sissy...

784
00:51:31,124 --> 00:51:33,562
Hey, I don't truck
with no sissies.

785
00:51:36,483 --> 00:51:39,276
- Louis.
- What?

786
00:51:40,904 --> 00:51:43,489
You did the Casitas
Youth Camp with Louis.

787
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,463
Why do you keep asking me about

788
00:51:45,464 --> 00:51:47,576
Louis? His business
is his business.

789
00:51:47,744 --> 00:51:51,247
Sugar, Louis told me you
went sissy up at Casitas.

790
00:51:51,414 --> 00:51:53,514
You couldn't do the
time, so you got

791
00:51:53,515 --> 00:51:55,501
a big white boy to look after you.

792
00:51:55,669 --> 00:52:00,339
Said they called you "Sugar"
because you gave it out so sweet.

793
00:52:01,174 --> 00:52:05,344
Louis gave it up at Casitas, man.
I was the boss jock in my dorm.

794
00:52:05,512 --> 00:52:06,595
Louis was the sissy.

795
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:08,973
Louis gave it up for
fucking candy bars.

796
00:52:08,974 --> 00:52:11,016
He ain't got the sense
of a goddamn dog.

797
00:52:12,102 --> 00:52:16,105
- I heard you like to shoot dogs.
- Dogs got no reason to live.

798
00:52:18,108 --> 00:52:20,220
You feel the same way
about people too?

799
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:21,527
What you trying to say?

800
00:52:21,945 --> 00:52:25,114
- We got the shotguns, Ray.
- I don't own no shotguns.

801
00:52:25,282 --> 00:52:27,658
Why were you throwing
clothes in the incinerator?

802
00:52:27,951 --> 00:52:28,993
Say what?

803
00:52:29,494 --> 00:52:31,755
A neighbour said she
saw you throwing

804
00:52:31,756 --> 00:52:33,956
clothes in the
backyard incinerator.

805
00:52:34,165 --> 00:52:35,374
It doesn't look good.

806
00:52:35,542 --> 00:52:37,710
I ain't got shit to say
till I see a judge.

807
00:52:37,919 --> 00:52:39,691
Were you on hop? You
were passed out

808
00:52:39,692 --> 00:52:41,463
when we arrested
you. You hopped up?

809
00:52:41,673 --> 00:52:44,216
Ty and Louis fuck with
that shit, not me.

810
00:52:44,426 --> 00:52:46,176
Where do they get their stuff?

811
00:52:47,512 --> 00:52:48,679
- Man...
- Come on.

812
00:52:49,097 --> 00:52:52,308
Give me one to feed the DA.
It'll make me look good...

813
00:52:52,517 --> 00:52:56,228
and I'll say Sugar Ray's not a
punk like his sissy partners.

814
00:53:01,484 --> 00:53:02,735
All right, Raymond.

815
00:53:02,902 --> 00:53:05,154
Tell me one more thing
about Jones and Fontaine.

816
00:53:05,530 --> 00:53:06,822
Where do they get drugs?

817
00:53:09,868 --> 00:53:11,410
Roland Navarette.

818
00:53:12,996 --> 00:53:15,664
He runs a hole-up on Bunker Hill.

819
00:53:15,832 --> 00:53:17,833
And he sells red devils.

820
00:53:18,626 --> 00:53:20,297
Exley's good, I'll give him that.

821
00:53:20,298 --> 00:53:21,503
I'm gonna take a break.

822
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:28,594
You know, Ray, I'm talking
about the gas chamber...

823
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:32,014
and you haven't even asked
me what this is about.

824
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,309
You got a big "guilty"
sign around your neck.

825
00:53:40,065 --> 00:53:43,275
That was masterful, Edmund.
This one's ready to go.

826
00:53:51,117 --> 00:53:53,702
Give Jones the newspaper.
I want him primed.

827
00:53:53,912 --> 00:53:56,246
Take the cuffs off,
so he can read it.

828
00:53:56,790 --> 00:54:00,584
Ray Collins just ratted you off.
Said the Nite Owl was your idea.

829
00:54:00,752 --> 00:54:02,801
I think it was Ray's
idea. You talk,

830
00:54:02,802 --> 00:54:04,463
I think I can save your life.

831
00:54:05,924 --> 00:54:08,801
Son, six people are dead, and
someone has to pay for it.

832
00:54:08,968 --> 00:54:11,929
Now, it can be you,
or it can be Ray.

833
00:54:14,099 --> 00:54:15,933
Louis, he called you queer.

834
00:54:16,267 --> 00:54:18,730
Said at Casitas, you
took it up the ass.

835
00:54:18,731 --> 00:54:20,104
I didn't kill nobody.

836
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,607
Son...

837
00:54:25,443 --> 00:54:28,070
you know what's gonna happen
to you if you don't talk.

838
00:54:28,238 --> 00:54:30,339
You'll go to the gas
chamber. So for

839
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:32,157
God's sake, admit what you did.

840
00:54:32,325 --> 00:54:34,076
I didn't mean to hurt her.

841
00:54:34,285 --> 00:54:37,121
- Maybe she's okay.
- Okay?

842
00:54:38,289 --> 00:54:40,044
These people are
all in the morgue.

843
00:54:40,045 --> 00:54:41,750
They were dead when you left them.

844
00:54:41,918 --> 00:54:46,463
I just wanted to lose my cherry.
She don't die, so I don't die.

845
00:54:46,798 --> 00:54:49,425
She don't die, so I don't die.

846
00:54:49,592 --> 00:54:52,219
Louis, who's the girl?
What's her name?

847
00:54:52,637 --> 00:54:54,388
Who are you talking about?

848
00:54:54,973 --> 00:54:56,723
Was she at the Nite Owl?

849
00:54:57,308 --> 00:54:59,643
Louis, listen to me. Was
she at the Nite Owl?

850
00:55:06,985 --> 00:55:09,528
- This newspaper shit ain't shit.
- Where's the girl?

851
00:55:09,696 --> 00:55:11,196
Did you kill her?

852
00:55:11,364 --> 00:55:13,907
You wanted Louis to lose his
cherry. That wasn't enough.

853
00:55:14,075 --> 00:55:16,034
Things got out of hand.
You made her bleed.

854
00:55:16,202 --> 00:55:18,620
She bled on your clothes,
so you burned the clothes.

855
00:55:18,788 --> 00:55:20,706
Who told you that?

856
00:55:20,999 --> 00:55:22,458
Now, listen to me.

857
00:55:22,667 --> 00:55:25,210
If that girl is alive, she's
the only chance you've got.

858
00:55:25,378 --> 00:55:26,622
I think she's alive.

859
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:28,714
You think? Then where is she now?

860
00:55:28,882 --> 00:55:31,884
Did you leave her some
place? Sell her out?

861
00:55:32,051 --> 00:55:33,719
- Tell me where she is.
- Move.

862
00:55:35,805 --> 00:55:38,891
What are you doing, man? Don't.

863
00:55:40,018 --> 00:55:41,059
White.

864
00:55:42,228 --> 00:55:43,825
One in six. Where's the girl?

865
00:55:43,826 --> 00:55:45,731
White, I have this under control.

866
00:55:45,899 --> 00:55:48,442
- Put the weapon down.
- Where is the girl?

867
00:55:53,865 --> 00:55:55,866
- Sylvester.
- What?

868
00:55:56,034 --> 00:55:59,661
Sylvester Fitch, 109 Avalon...

869
00:56:00,121 --> 00:56:03,707
brown corner house, upstairs.

870
00:56:15,094 --> 00:56:16,745
Captain, just give me one minute.

871
00:56:16,746 --> 00:56:17,746
You got it.

872
00:56:23,561 --> 00:56:26,772
Nobody moves. The rest of
us are going in the front.

873
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:29,316
Stay put until I give the word.

874
00:58:54,754 --> 00:58:56,546
He went around back, sir.

875
00:58:58,132 --> 00:59:00,634
Miss, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
I'm sorry to ask you this.

876
00:59:00,802 --> 00:59:02,904
I need to know what
time they left you.

877
00:59:02,905 --> 00:59:04,805
Get her to the
hospital. Excuse me.

878
00:59:05,306 --> 00:59:06,723
Give your career a rest.

879
00:59:07,225 --> 00:59:08,558
Leave her alone.

880
00:59:08,726 --> 00:59:11,395
A naked guy with a gun? You
expect anyone to believe that?

881
00:59:11,562 --> 00:59:13,814
Get the fuck away from me.

882
00:59:13,981 --> 00:59:15,663
How's it gonna look
in your report?

883
00:59:15,664 --> 00:59:16,858
It'll look like justice.

884
00:59:17,026 --> 00:59:19,444
That's what the man got. Justice.

885
00:59:19,612 --> 00:59:21,780
You don't know the
meaning of the word.

886
00:59:22,573 --> 00:59:25,867
Yeah? Well, you think it means
getting your picture in the paper.

887
00:59:26,077 --> 00:59:28,370
Go after criminals for a
change, instead of cops.

888
00:59:28,538 --> 00:59:30,706
Stensland got what he
deserved and so will you.

889
00:59:36,129 --> 00:59:37,379
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

890
00:59:40,633 --> 00:59:41,967
Take it easy. Come on, Bud.

891
00:59:42,969 --> 00:59:45,470
Come on. Let it go.

892
00:59:45,638 --> 00:59:47,639
It's best to stay away
when his blood is up.

893
00:59:47,807 --> 00:59:49,433
His blood's always up.

894
00:59:50,935 --> 00:59:52,978
You should stay away
from him altogether.

895
00:59:53,855 --> 00:59:57,232
Raymond Collins, Ty Jones
and Louis Fontaine.

896
00:59:57,442 --> 01:00:00,152
They are considered armed
and extremely dangerous.

897
01:00:00,361 --> 01:00:02,988
Repeat. The Nite Owl
suspects have escaped.

898
01:00:03,448 --> 01:00:05,323
How did they get out the window?

899
01:00:05,533 --> 01:00:07,409
They jumped from the second floor.

900
01:00:07,618 --> 01:00:10,036
Girl made her statement.
Jigs left her at midnight.

901
01:00:10,204 --> 01:00:11,830
Time to be at the Nite Owl by 1.

902
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:14,592
The question was
where did they get

903
01:00:14,593 --> 01:00:16,293
their drugs. What was the answer?

904
01:00:16,461 --> 01:00:18,545
I haven't gotten that far yet.

905
01:00:18,796 --> 01:00:22,424
"Roland Navarette, lives on
Bunker Hill, runs a hole-up..."

906
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:26,094
Anyone seen Jack Vincennes?

907
01:00:28,139 --> 01:00:31,850
- Is something up, lieutenant?
- I need some backup. Come on.

908
01:00:49,076 --> 01:00:51,328
- What?
- Nothing. Let's go.

909
01:00:59,837 --> 01:01:01,254
This should be it.

910
01:01:05,843 --> 01:01:07,761
404.

911
01:01:28,574 --> 01:01:30,242
Nobody moves.

912
01:01:31,244 --> 01:01:33,137
Stay right there.
You're under arrest.

913
01:01:33,138 --> 01:01:34,138
Don't shoot.

914
01:01:34,139 --> 01:01:36,915
- Please don't shoot.
- Don't move. Don't move.

915
01:02:29,093 --> 01:02:32,220
There he is. You did good, kid.

916
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:35,682
You should've seen the place. It
was a nightmare. Blood everywhere.

917
01:02:36,267 --> 01:02:38,226
Who would have
thought? Shotgun Ed.

918
01:02:38,394 --> 01:02:41,271
- Shotgun Ed.
- Somebody get him cleaned up.

919
01:02:41,522 --> 01:02:43,148
Come on, kid.

920
01:02:45,776 --> 01:02:49,070
Edmund J. Exley has amassed
a brilliant record...

921
01:02:49,238 --> 01:02:52,407
in his seven years with the Los
Angeles Police Department.

922
01:02:52,617 --> 01:02:55,744
Recently, he evinced spectacular
bravery in the line of duty.

923
01:02:55,953 --> 01:02:58,788
It is our privilege to present
him with our highest honour:

924
01:02:59,123 --> 01:03:00,832
The Medal of Valour.

925
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,335
- What kind of car was it?
- It was a Ford.

926
01:03:03,544 --> 01:03:06,338
My husband always drove a Ford.
I know what they look like.

927
01:03:06,964 --> 01:03:09,758
Excuse me, ma'am. Just the
facts. Light or dark?

928
01:03:09,926 --> 01:03:13,720
Light. And that's really
all I remember, officer.

929
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:16,640
Thank you, ma'am.
You've been a big help.

930
01:03:17,141 --> 01:03:18,850
Cut. That's a print.

931
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:22,062
- Hey, Big Jack.
- He's back.

932
01:03:22,229 --> 01:03:25,857
Hey. Jack's back. Ha-ha.

933
01:03:57,431 --> 01:04:01,017
Tell Mr Patchett that I have no
intention of changing my vote.

934
01:04:12,613 --> 01:04:15,251
It may surprise some
that a man in office

935
01:04:15,252 --> 01:04:17,450
would admit to making a mistake...

936
01:04:18,285 --> 01:04:20,704
but after due consideration...

937
01:04:21,288 --> 01:04:24,541
I am changing my position on
the matter before the council.

938
01:04:26,335 --> 01:04:29,671
"Go west, America," was the
slogan of Manifest Destiny.

939
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:33,675
Today is that last step
westward with no stop signs...

940
01:04:33,843 --> 01:04:37,846
no traffic signals, from downtown
to the beach in 20 minutes.

941
01:05:09,253 --> 01:05:11,254
What were you gonna start with?

942
01:05:13,507 --> 01:05:15,008
Prostitution?

943
01:05:16,761 --> 01:05:18,094
Gambling?

944
01:05:21,432 --> 01:05:25,602
Go back to Jersey, sonny. This
is the City of the Angels...

945
01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:27,937
and you haven't got any wings.

946
01:05:50,795 --> 01:05:53,129
Nice to see you again. Take care.

947
01:06:30,459 --> 01:06:33,670
I wondered when you might knock
on my door again, Officer White.

948
01:06:34,338 --> 01:06:35,672
It's Bud.

949
01:06:37,091 --> 01:06:38,258
Bud.

950
01:07:07,621 --> 01:07:08,705
Why me?

951
01:07:10,791 --> 01:07:12,041
I don't know.

952
01:07:48,662 --> 01:07:49,913
This election...

953
01:07:50,122 --> 01:07:53,416
is about the future of law
enforcement in Los Angeles.

954
01:07:53,584 --> 01:07:56,628
City Councilman Rogers
represents that future.

955
01:07:57,004 --> 01:07:58,713
So let's dig deep...

956
01:07:58,881 --> 01:08:00,826
and let's get a
moral man re-elected.

957
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:02,717
Ellis Loew would like a few words.

958
01:08:06,138 --> 01:08:07,968
Thank you. Thank you,
Brett Chase, the

959
01:08:07,969 --> 01:08:09,891
very talented star of
"Badge of Honour".

960
01:08:12,186 --> 01:08:14,324
Let me tell you, I
am so thrilled to be

961
01:08:14,325 --> 01:08:16,356
here on the set of
"Badge of Honour".

962
01:08:16,523 --> 01:08:18,775
Big V. Jackie.

963
01:08:20,027 --> 01:08:21,736
Good to see you back.

964
01:08:21,946 --> 01:08:24,697
- How they hanging, Sid?
- Down around my ankles.

965
01:08:24,949 --> 01:08:27,951
- You tight with the DA, Jackie?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

966
01:08:28,118 --> 01:08:30,578
He tried to throw me off
the force last Christmas.

967
01:08:30,746 --> 01:08:32,455
How about some payback, big-time?

968
01:08:32,623 --> 01:08:36,834
Plus the usual $50 donation to the
Jack Vincennes retirement fund.

969
01:08:37,002 --> 01:08:40,964
- Did you know the DA was a swish?
- No kidding.

970
01:08:43,509 --> 01:08:45,003
Remember Matt Reynolds? Christmas

971
01:08:45,004 --> 01:08:46,678
Eve? "The Movie
Premiere Pot Bust"?

972
01:08:46,845 --> 01:08:49,514
- He just got off the honour farm.
- What's he doing here?

973
01:08:50,391 --> 01:08:52,976
Reynolds is acey-deucey,
not to mention broke.

974
01:08:53,143 --> 01:08:55,436
I'm getting him to fuck
the DA for 100 bucks.

975
01:08:55,604 --> 01:08:58,648
That's twice the 50 you got
for wrecking his career.

976
01:08:59,358 --> 01:09:02,902
- Hey, Matt. Come here, come here.
- Jesus, don't bring him...

977
01:09:07,825 --> 01:09:09,492
That's DA Loew right there.

978
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:13,413
Yeah.

979
01:09:14,748 --> 01:09:16,040
You need a drink, kid?

980
01:09:16,917 --> 01:09:20,211
- Yeah.
- Jack, look after him a minute.

981
01:09:20,379 --> 01:09:24,340
Matt, this is Jack. No
secrets between me and him.

982
01:09:29,596 --> 01:09:32,015
- How you doing?
- Oh, I'm okay. How are you?

983
01:09:32,182 --> 01:09:34,434
I'm good. Yeah.

984
01:09:36,437 --> 01:09:38,271
Have we, met before?

985
01:09:40,607 --> 01:09:41,858
Yeah.

986
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:44,089
Was it at a party?

987
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:46,362
Well, it was something like that.

988
01:09:47,948 --> 01:09:49,574
Fleur-de-Lis party, right?

989
01:09:50,868 --> 01:09:52,035
Right.

990
01:09:52,703 --> 01:09:54,203
Fleur-de-Lis.

991
01:09:54,788 --> 01:09:56,789
"Whatever you desire."

992
01:09:57,041 --> 01:09:59,709
Dope, hookers that look
like movie stars...

993
01:10:00,127 --> 01:10:02,795
- Pierce Patchett has it all.
- Ha-ha-ha.

994
01:10:02,963 --> 01:10:04,839
Boy, you could say that again.

995
01:10:05,049 --> 01:10:10,636
Pierce, he's not like regular
guys. I mean, I dig him, but...

996
01:10:12,139 --> 01:10:15,725
you know, he, scares me too.

997
01:10:16,477 --> 01:10:19,062
Really? How?

998
01:10:20,147 --> 01:10:22,561
When I came out to
L.A., this isn't

999
01:10:22,562 --> 01:10:25,109
exactly where I saw
myself ending up.

1000
01:10:26,403 --> 01:10:29,072
Yeah, well, get in line.

1001
01:10:29,573 --> 01:10:31,657
That's courage, kid. Drink up.

1002
01:10:35,954 --> 01:10:38,623
You know, I don't think
I should do this.

1003
01:10:39,166 --> 01:10:40,875
It's not like you don't know how.

1004
01:10:41,043 --> 01:10:43,878
And Jack here's got connections
with "Badge of Honour".

1005
01:10:44,046 --> 01:10:46,130
You pull this off, there'll
be a part for you.

1006
01:10:46,298 --> 01:10:49,300
I smell a comeback,
don't you, Jack?

1007
01:10:51,929 --> 01:10:56,015
Go on. The DA's free. Go
introduce yourself. Go on.

1008
01:10:56,433 --> 01:10:59,102
Talk to him, Jack. Tell him
about the opening on the show.

1009
01:10:59,269 --> 01:11:02,522
Oh, yeah. I'm pretty sure I can
get you a part on this show.

1010
01:11:02,773 --> 01:11:04,732
But, that's later on.

1011
01:11:04,900 --> 01:11:06,998
You know, tonight, just go on over

1012
01:11:06,999 --> 01:11:09,404
there and pretend
it's an acting job.

1013
01:11:09,571 --> 01:11:12,532
- Like show biz.
- Acting, that's it.

1014
01:11:12,699 --> 01:11:13,783
- Right.
- Yeah.

1015
01:11:13,951 --> 01:11:15,984
No one's gonna know
about this, right?

1016
01:11:15,985 --> 01:11:16,985
No.

1017
01:11:18,872 --> 01:11:20,540
It'll be our secret.

1018
01:11:22,751 --> 01:11:25,128
Okay. All right.

1019
01:11:25,295 --> 01:11:27,755
- Show biz.
- That's it. Go on.

1020
01:11:31,218 --> 01:11:34,512
Show biz. Man.

1021
01:11:34,888 --> 01:11:37,348
If Reynolds works his charms,
which I know he will...

1022
01:11:37,516 --> 01:11:40,309
they'll be at the Hollywood
Centre Motel, Room 203.

1023
01:11:40,477 --> 01:11:42,603
Meet me there at midnight
for a photo shoot.

1024
01:11:43,730 --> 01:11:46,899
Maybe we can work in the
Hollywood sign this time.

1025
01:11:48,402 --> 01:11:50,903
What do you know about
Pierce Patchett?

1026
01:11:51,572 --> 01:11:54,240
Patchett? I know what you
know. He's very rich.

1027
01:11:54,408 --> 01:11:56,194
Just invested in
freeway construction,

1028
01:11:56,195 --> 01:11:57,660
which is gonna make him richer.

1029
01:11:57,995 --> 01:11:59,078
Why do you ask?

1030
01:11:59,246 --> 01:12:01,372
I just keep hearing
rumours, you know.

1031
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:04,792
High-class porn, drugs, hookers
that look like movie stars.

1032
01:12:05,252 --> 01:12:07,632
Ha. Patchett's what
I call twilight.

1033
01:12:07,633 --> 01:12:09,755
He ain't queer and he ain't red.

1034
01:12:09,923 --> 01:12:13,634
He cannot help me in my quest
for prime "sinnuendo."

1035
01:12:19,057 --> 01:12:20,968
As though "Badge of Honour" would

1036
01:12:20,969 --> 01:12:23,227
touch that guy with
a 10-foot pole...

1037
01:12:23,395 --> 01:12:26,522
after he's been Hush-Hush
cover boy twice in one year.

1038
01:12:26,690 --> 01:12:27,982
See you in a few hours, Sid.

1039
01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:32,236
Yeah, midnight. I guarantee all
kinds of illegal activity.

1040
01:13:05,437 --> 01:13:07,438
- Another, Jack?
- Yeah.

1041
01:13:51,984 --> 01:13:53,568
Kid?

1042
01:13:59,283 --> 01:14:00,449
Matt?

1043
01:14:00,993 --> 01:14:04,203
Come on, kid, you don't
have to do the...

1044
01:14:35,485 --> 01:14:37,403
Thank you for what
you did for me...

1045
01:14:37,904 --> 01:14:40,531
for killing those
animals who raped me.

1046
01:14:40,866 --> 01:14:43,576
Will you thank Officer
White for me, please?

1047
01:14:43,869 --> 01:14:44,910
Sure.

1048
01:14:46,622 --> 01:14:48,580
Seeing him come
through the door is

1049
01:14:48,581 --> 01:14:50,374
about the only thing I remember.

1050
01:14:50,584 --> 01:14:51,751
Thank God.

1051
01:14:53,003 --> 01:14:55,546
You remember what time the
Negroes left you, right?

1052
01:14:55,881 --> 01:14:59,050
In your statement, you said
they left you at midnight.

1053
01:14:59,259 --> 01:15:00,384
They might have.

1054
01:15:05,932 --> 01:15:07,597
What do you mean, they might have?

1055
01:15:07,598 --> 01:15:09,352
I don't know what
time they left me.

1056
01:15:09,519 --> 01:15:11,228
I wanted them dead.

1057
01:15:11,563 --> 01:15:15,066
Would anyone care that they
raped a Mexican girl...

1058
01:15:15,233 --> 01:15:18,277
if they hadn't killed those
white people at the Nite Owl?

1059
01:15:19,237 --> 01:15:21,530
I did what I had
to do for justice.

1060
01:15:21,698 --> 01:15:25,076
Inez? Exley, over
here. Smile, Inez.

1061
01:15:25,994 --> 01:15:28,412
So is he your hero, Miss Soto?

1062
01:15:29,122 --> 01:15:31,186
Fellas, how about
this? "Rape Victim

1063
01:15:31,187 --> 01:15:33,584
Wheeled out of Hospital
by Nite Owl Hero."

1064
01:15:35,921 --> 01:15:37,421
Hey.

1065
01:15:39,257 --> 01:15:41,467
All they get is Veronica Lake.

1066
01:15:43,637 --> 01:15:45,971
I get Lynn Margaret Bracken.

1067
01:15:57,109 --> 01:15:58,192
Bisbee?

1068
01:16:00,445 --> 01:16:01,987
I grew up there.

1069
01:16:04,116 --> 01:16:08,619
I'm going back in a couple of
years, open up a dress shop.

1070
01:16:10,622 --> 01:16:13,499
The girls in Bisbee
need a little glamour.

1071
01:16:19,339 --> 01:16:21,716
Where'd this come from?

1072
01:16:22,676 --> 01:16:24,699
When I was 12, my old
man went after my

1073
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:26,721
mother with a bottle.
I got in the way.

1074
01:16:28,682 --> 01:16:30,307
So you saved her.

1075
01:16:31,685 --> 01:16:33,102
Not for long.

1076
01:16:36,148 --> 01:16:38,010
I'm sorry. It's none
of my business.

1077
01:16:38,011 --> 01:16:39,442
He tied me to the radiator.

1078
01:16:40,193 --> 01:16:43,362
I watched him beat my mother
to death with a tyre iron...

1079
01:16:45,824 --> 01:16:47,992
and he left me there.

1080
01:16:50,078 --> 01:16:52,872
Three days before a
truant officer found us.

1081
01:16:56,001 --> 01:16:57,877
They never found the old man.

1082
01:17:07,220 --> 01:17:09,221
Is that why you became a cop?

1083
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:11,390
To get even?

1084
01:17:12,851 --> 01:17:14,185
Maybe.

1085
01:17:16,062 --> 01:17:18,063
Do you like it?

1086
01:17:21,026 --> 01:17:22,818
I used to.

1087
01:17:24,362 --> 01:17:27,072
Now it's all strong-arm,
sitting-duck stuff.

1088
01:17:28,074 --> 01:17:29,408
I mean, if I could...

1089
01:17:30,702 --> 01:17:33,204
If I could get a chance
to work Homicide...

1090
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:36,415
like a real detective...

1091
01:17:36,875 --> 01:17:39,418
That prick Exley, he
shot the wrong guys.

1092
01:17:40,253 --> 01:17:42,396
Whoever killed Stensland's still

1093
01:17:42,397 --> 01:17:45,007
around. I know it
in here. I know it.

1094
01:17:45,467 --> 01:17:47,384
There's something wrong
with the Nite Owl.

1095
01:17:47,719 --> 01:17:49,887
I just can't prove it, that's all.

1096
01:17:51,097 --> 01:17:53,057
I'm not smart enough.

1097
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:58,229
I'm just the guy they bring in
to scare the other guy shitless.

1098
01:18:01,608 --> 01:18:03,067
You're wrong.

1099
01:18:03,902 --> 01:18:06,445
You found Patchett. You found me.

1100
01:18:06,822 --> 01:18:08,614
You're smart enough.

1101
01:18:20,293 --> 01:18:23,879
Bud White. What brings you
down to the basement?

1102
01:18:27,133 --> 01:18:29,176
I got a couple of
Nite Owl questions.

1103
01:18:29,344 --> 01:18:32,429
Don't know if you read the
papers, but that case is closed.

1104
01:18:34,432 --> 01:18:36,267
Anything bother you about it, Ray?

1105
01:18:36,977 --> 01:18:38,937
The fact that the
pack-up boys haven't

1106
01:18:38,938 --> 01:18:40,646
hauled this shit out of here yet.

1107
01:18:45,443 --> 01:18:47,653
We got three shotguns taken
from the suspects...

1108
01:18:47,821 --> 01:18:50,447
which match the strike marks
on the shell casings.

1109
01:18:50,615 --> 01:18:52,283
What more do you want?

1110
01:19:04,004 --> 01:19:05,838
There's blood on the wall here.

1111
01:19:06,506 --> 01:19:08,966
I thought everyone got
shot in the men's room.

1112
01:19:09,175 --> 01:19:11,635
That is Stensland's blood.

1113
01:19:12,178 --> 01:19:13,679
Stensland?

1114
01:19:13,847 --> 01:19:15,825
Blow to the head.
Probably unconscious

1115
01:19:15,826 --> 01:19:17,600
when they dragged him in the John.

1116
01:19:19,311 --> 01:19:20,561
Did they hit anyone else?

1117
01:19:20,729 --> 01:19:24,148
No, but he was a cop. He
probably tried to do something.

1118
01:19:28,028 --> 01:19:31,614
Grilled cheese, black coffee.
Someone sitting next to him.

1119
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:37,328
Two of the victims were women?

1120
01:19:37,495 --> 01:19:39,681
Yeah, Patti DeLuca,
the night shift

1121
01:19:39,682 --> 01:19:41,624
waitress, and a Susan Lefferts.

1122
01:19:46,212 --> 01:19:48,005
Susan Lefferts.

1123
01:19:49,841 --> 01:19:51,842
Yeah, what about her?

1124
01:19:54,304 --> 01:19:55,679
You're welcome.

1125
01:19:57,974 --> 01:20:00,059
Mrs Lefferts.

1126
01:20:01,686 --> 01:20:05,648
Mrs Lefferts? I'm
Officer White, L.A.P.D.

1127
01:20:07,901 --> 01:20:09,586
Tell me about the
boyfriend. The one

1128
01:20:09,587 --> 01:20:11,362
you mentioned at the
coroner's office.

1129
01:20:11,571 --> 01:20:13,948
I told you I didn't approve
of that boyfriend.

1130
01:20:14,532 --> 01:20:18,911
He was too old for you. And
you let him be fresh with me.

1131
01:20:20,705 --> 01:20:23,165
They came here one day
when I wasn't home.

1132
01:20:23,541 --> 01:20:25,459
Mrs Jensen next door said...

1133
01:20:25,627 --> 01:20:28,671
she thought she saw Susie's
boyfriend and another man...

1134
01:20:28,838 --> 01:20:31,215
and she heard a ruckus.

1135
01:20:32,092 --> 01:20:35,928
- What was the boyfriend's name?
- We weren't properly introduced.

1136
01:20:36,554 --> 01:20:38,889
Susie gave him a nickname,
"Muns" or "Luns."

1137
01:20:39,057 --> 01:20:41,642
Stens? Was it Stens?

1138
01:20:41,810 --> 01:20:46,397
- Maybe. I don't know.
- Look at a picture for me.

1139
01:20:49,109 --> 01:20:51,735
That's him. That's him.

1140
01:20:57,117 --> 01:20:59,284
You said a neighbour
heard a ruckus.

1141
01:21:00,078 --> 01:21:02,121
Was it outside? Inside?

1142
01:21:03,415 --> 01:21:04,581
Outside.

1143
01:21:04,749 --> 01:21:08,836
And then Mrs Jensen said they
kept going under the house.

1144
01:21:12,924 --> 01:21:15,259
You have to leave now, officer.

1145
01:21:16,469 --> 01:21:19,930
- What's through here?
- Just a room full of old things.

1146
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:22,099
Don't move that.

1147
01:21:23,476 --> 01:21:24,518
Phew.

1148
01:21:24,686 --> 01:21:28,147
Don't mind the smell. I think
a rat died behind the wall.

1149
01:21:29,441 --> 01:21:31,608
My Susie was a good girl.

1150
01:21:31,776 --> 01:21:34,778
She was never in any
kind of trouble at all.

1151
01:21:37,907 --> 01:21:38,949
Phew.

1152
01:22:46,017 --> 01:22:48,477
"Leland Meeks."
Never heard of you.

1153
01:22:48,686 --> 01:22:50,229
They call me Buzz.

1154
01:22:57,445 --> 01:22:58,529
Was it a rat?

1155
01:22:59,405 --> 01:23:01,240
Yeah, a great big one.

1156
01:23:03,701 --> 01:23:07,496
Here. Compliments of the Los
Angeles Police Department.

1157
01:23:24,722 --> 01:23:27,683
Stomach of the week
from a motel homicide.

1158
01:23:27,892 --> 01:23:31,311
Unemployed actor had frankfurter,
French fries, alcohol and sperm.

1159
01:23:31,479 --> 01:23:33,939
Hell of a last supper, don't
you think, lieutenant?

1160
01:23:34,107 --> 01:23:36,733
Anything bothering you
about the, Nite Owl case?

1161
01:23:36,901 --> 01:23:39,570
Yeah, the fact that you guys
won't let it get filed away.

1162
01:23:40,738 --> 01:23:41,845
What do you mean?

1163
01:23:41,846 --> 01:23:44,408
Bud White grilled me
on it this morning.

1164
01:23:45,442 --> 01:23:46,442
Bud White?

1165
01:23:46,443 --> 01:23:49,413
You know, he's not as
dumb as I thought.

1166
01:23:51,624 --> 01:23:54,418
Did he say where he was going
after he talked to you?

1167
01:24:06,806 --> 01:24:08,640
Let my daughter rest in peace.

1168
01:24:08,850 --> 01:24:11,059
Mrs Lefferts, I just wanna
ask a few questions.

1169
01:24:11,227 --> 01:24:13,604
Officer White already
checked under the house.

1170
01:24:14,189 --> 01:24:15,272
Under the house?

1171
01:24:16,024 --> 01:24:18,358
- Where?
- Out back.

1172
01:24:19,777 --> 01:24:21,445
All he found was rodents.

1173
01:24:24,782 --> 01:24:26,977
I need an ID on this
as soon as possible.

1174
01:24:26,978 --> 01:24:28,702
You talk only to me on this one.

1175
01:24:31,789 --> 01:24:33,749
Vincennes, I need your
help with something.

1176
01:24:33,917 --> 01:24:35,965
I'm busy right now.
Why don't you just

1177
01:24:35,966 --> 01:24:37,961
go ask some of your
boys in Homicide?

1178
01:24:40,215 --> 01:24:42,883
I can't. I need someone
outside of Homicide.

1179
01:24:43,509 --> 01:24:46,428
I want you to tail Bud White till
he goes on duty this evening.

1180
01:24:47,889 --> 01:24:50,140
Do me a real favour
and leave me alone.

1181
01:24:51,267 --> 01:24:53,602
Do you make the Negroes for
the Nite Owl killings?

1182
01:24:56,898 --> 01:24:59,483
- What?
- It's a simple question.

1183
01:25:01,569 --> 01:25:04,488
Why in the world do you wanna
go digging any deeper...

1184
01:25:04,656 --> 01:25:08,116
into the Nite Owl
killings, lieutenant?

1185
01:25:11,955 --> 01:25:13,664
Rollo Tomasi.

1186
01:25:15,416 --> 01:25:18,502
Is there more to that, or
am I supposed to guess?

1187
01:25:20,588 --> 01:25:22,756
Rollo was a purse snatcher.

1188
01:25:27,178 --> 01:25:29,263
My father ran into him off-duty...

1189
01:25:31,266 --> 01:25:34,351
and he shot my father six
times and got away clean.

1190
01:25:35,853 --> 01:25:37,604
No one even knew who he was.

1191
01:25:38,439 --> 01:25:40,524
I made the name up to
give him personality.

1192
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:43,485
What's your point?

1193
01:25:44,112 --> 01:25:46,863
Rollo Tomasi's the
reason I became a cop.

1194
01:25:47,615 --> 01:25:49,179
I wanted to catch the guys who

1195
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:51,159
thought they could
get away with it.

1196
01:25:52,578 --> 01:25:54,371
It was supposed to
be about justice.

1197
01:25:55,373 --> 01:25:58,375
Then somewhere along the
way, I lost sight of that.

1198
01:26:02,547 --> 01:26:03,797
Why'd you become a cop?

1199
01:26:09,554 --> 01:26:11,054
Huh.

1200
01:26:14,559 --> 01:26:16,601
I don't remember.

1201
01:26:22,817 --> 01:26:26,528
- What do you want, Exley?
- I just wanna solve this thing.

1202
01:26:27,071 --> 01:26:30,407
- Nite Owl was solved.
- No.

1203
01:26:31,659 --> 01:26:32,993
I wanna do it right.

1204
01:26:33,661 --> 01:26:36,079
Even if it means paying
the consequences?

1205
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,585
All right, college
boy, I'll help...

1206
01:26:41,753 --> 01:26:44,588
but there's a case your boys
in Homicide don't care about.

1207
01:26:44,756 --> 01:26:46,822
They think it's just another

1208
01:26:46,823 --> 01:26:49,551
Hollywood "homo-cide,"
but I don't.

1209
01:26:49,719 --> 01:26:52,846
You help me with mine,
I'll help you with yours.

1210
01:26:53,264 --> 01:26:56,099
- Deal?
- Deal.

1211
01:27:28,591 --> 01:27:30,675
Johnny Stompanato.

1212
01:27:31,844 --> 01:27:34,721
Officer Wendell White.
How's tricks, paisano?

1213
01:27:34,931 --> 01:27:36,598
I ain't your paisano.

1214
01:27:37,350 --> 01:27:39,476
I ain't in the snitch
business any more.

1215
01:27:39,644 --> 01:27:41,937
You know a guy named Buzz Meeks?

1216
01:27:43,022 --> 01:27:44,856
Works for Pierce Patchett.

1217
01:27:45,441 --> 01:27:46,608
Should I?

1218
01:27:48,027 --> 01:27:50,904
You're muscle for hire.
Meeks is muscle for hire.

1219
01:27:51,114 --> 01:27:52,447
You tell me.

1220
01:27:53,491 --> 01:27:55,867
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I remember now.

1221
01:27:56,035 --> 01:28:00,163
Meeks is a run-down ex-cop. Same
as you're gonna be someday.

1222
01:28:00,373 --> 01:28:01,832
And that's all you're gonna get.

1223
01:28:02,708 --> 01:28:04,543
And you can keep your 20 bucks.

1224
01:28:10,049 --> 01:28:13,468
What do I get if I give you your
balls back, you wop cocksucker?

1225
01:28:14,429 --> 01:28:17,639
Okay. Okay.

1226
01:28:17,807 --> 01:28:20,183
There was a rumour going around...

1227
01:28:20,393 --> 01:28:23,520
that Meeks had a line
on a large supply of H.

1228
01:28:25,565 --> 01:28:30,527
- And?
- And nothing. He skipped out.

1229
01:28:42,915 --> 01:28:44,082
Bullshit.

1230
01:28:45,042 --> 01:28:48,211
How would Meeks get his hands
on a large supply of heroin?

1231
01:28:49,046 --> 01:28:52,382
You're right. It's
probably bullshit.

1232
01:28:52,592 --> 01:28:55,093
Even if he did, he
could never unload it.

1233
01:28:55,386 --> 01:28:57,888
Not without drawing all
kinds of attention.

1234
01:28:58,431 --> 01:29:00,312
Maybe that's why he's
under a house in

1235
01:29:00,313 --> 01:29:02,434
Elysian Park and he
don't smell too good...

1236
01:29:03,936 --> 01:29:05,270
paisano.

1237
01:29:57,698 --> 01:30:00,242
Maybe White's not
so dumb after all.

1238
01:30:13,464 --> 01:30:15,523
We got Rita Hayworth
at the morgue,

1239
01:30:15,524 --> 01:30:17,467
and now Veronica Lake with White.

1240
01:30:18,010 --> 01:30:20,055
I think your case and my case are

1241
01:30:20,056 --> 01:30:22,347
connected. It's
Fleur-de-Lis again.

1242
01:30:22,515 --> 01:30:23,682
Fleur-de-Lis?

1243
01:30:24,016 --> 01:30:26,309
Yeah. "Whatever you desire."

1244
01:30:26,519 --> 01:30:27,644
Porno.

1245
01:30:27,979 --> 01:30:30,814
High-class whores cut to
look like movie stars.

1246
01:30:31,023 --> 01:30:34,651
Who knows what else. Reynolds, the
kid that got killed, was involved.

1247
01:30:34,860 --> 01:30:36,486
So is Pierce Patchett.

1248
01:30:36,696 --> 01:30:37,988
The millionaire?

1249
01:30:38,489 --> 01:30:40,490
Yeah, I think we
should go talk to him.

1250
01:30:41,325 --> 01:30:43,326
First I wanna brace Stompanato.

1251
01:30:59,594 --> 01:31:02,053
Want an autograph? Write to MGM.

1252
01:31:02,888 --> 01:31:06,182
Since when do two-bit hoods and
hookers give out autographs?

1253
01:31:06,559 --> 01:31:09,144
- What did you say to me?
- L.A.P.D. Sit down.

1254
01:31:09,353 --> 01:31:10,979
Who the hell do you think you are?

1255
01:31:11,147 --> 01:31:13,857
Take a walk, honey, before
I haul your ass downtown.

1256
01:31:14,025 --> 01:31:16,818
- You are making a large mistake.
- Get away from our table.

1257
01:31:17,028 --> 01:31:18,361
Shut up.

1258
01:31:19,447 --> 01:31:21,781
A hooker cut to look like
Turner is still a hooker.

1259
01:31:21,949 --> 01:31:24,326
- Hey.
- She just looks like Lana Turner.

1260
01:31:24,493 --> 01:31:27,037
- She is Lana Turner.
- What?

1261
01:31:27,204 --> 01:31:29,289
She is Lana Turner.

1262
01:31:37,923 --> 01:31:39,758
How was I supposed to know?

1263
01:31:56,108 --> 01:31:59,903
I believe the Nite Owl's your
area of expertise, Mr Exley.

1264
01:32:00,071 --> 01:32:02,614
I saw you on television
getting your medal.

1265
01:32:04,116 --> 01:32:05,408
And you're...

1266
01:32:05,785 --> 01:32:09,621
that other Hollywood celebrity
policeman, aren't you?

1267
01:32:10,581 --> 01:32:12,557
The Veronica Lake
look-alike works for

1268
01:32:12,558 --> 01:32:14,584
you. She's one of
your whores, correct?

1269
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:19,089
- A vulgar term.
- Why's she seeing Bud White?

1270
01:32:19,256 --> 01:32:23,093
Why do men and women usually
see each other, Mr Exley?

1271
01:32:25,971 --> 01:32:28,682
Let's try this on for
size: Fleur-de-Lis.

1272
01:32:29,141 --> 01:32:30,934
"Whatever you desire."

1273
01:32:31,602 --> 01:32:34,562
An actor named Matt Reynolds.

1274
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:38,566
No? Nothing?

1275
01:32:39,151 --> 01:32:42,278
- No?
- We want some answers, Patchett.

1276
01:32:44,949 --> 01:32:46,825
We all want something.

1277
01:32:48,452 --> 01:32:51,121
- Lieutenant Exley, come in.
- Guy's as cool as they come.

1278
01:32:53,666 --> 01:32:56,501
Lieutenant Exley, come
in, please. Over.

1279
01:32:57,670 --> 01:32:58,712
This is Exley.

1280
01:32:58,879 --> 01:33:01,631
The coroner wants to talk to
you. He says he has your ID.

1281
01:33:02,174 --> 01:33:04,759
Tell him Sergeant Vincennes
is coming in to talk to him.

1282
01:33:04,927 --> 01:33:06,803
- Roger.
- I'll drop you at your car.

1283
01:33:06,971 --> 01:33:09,180
- Where the hell are you going?
- Lynn Bracken's.

1284
01:33:09,473 --> 01:33:12,976
I'm gonna find out why Patchett
has her seeing Bud White.

1285
01:33:13,144 --> 01:33:14,811
See you at the Frolic Room.

1286
01:33:14,979 --> 01:33:18,231
Oh, great. You get the
girl, I get the coroner.

1287
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:31,244
Hush-Hush, off the
record and on the Q.T.

1288
01:33:34,081 --> 01:33:37,584
Hey, I was just coming up to
see you. You get that ID?

1289
01:33:37,752 --> 01:33:40,092
Thank God for dental
records. Stiff

1290
01:33:40,093 --> 01:33:42,172
used to be a cop. Leland Meeks.

1291
01:33:42,339 --> 01:33:43,506
Buzz Meeks?

1292
01:33:43,674 --> 01:33:44,841
- You knew him?
- Of him.

1293
01:33:45,050 --> 01:33:48,636
He was around when I joined
the force. Bad rep. Thanks.

1294
01:33:48,804 --> 01:33:52,682
Hey. "Just the facts,"
Jack. "Just the facts."

1295
01:33:56,020 --> 01:33:57,145
Anything else, sergeant?

1296
01:33:57,354 --> 01:34:00,523
Leland Meeks worked Vice '39 -'41.
I need to see his arrest records.

1297
01:34:00,691 --> 01:34:02,859
Okay.

1298
01:34:08,407 --> 01:34:11,034
Miss Bracken, I'm
Lieutenant Exley.

1299
01:34:11,243 --> 01:34:14,996
I know who you are. Bud
told me all about you.

1300
01:34:15,164 --> 01:34:17,040
Is that so?

1301
01:34:17,333 --> 01:34:20,043
And what did White have to say?

1302
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:22,879
He said you were smart.

1303
01:34:23,547 --> 01:34:25,364
He also said you
were a coward, and

1304
01:34:25,365 --> 01:34:27,383
that you'd screw
yourself to get ahead.

1305
01:34:28,052 --> 01:34:30,553
Well, let's concentrate
on my smarts.

1306
01:34:30,721 --> 01:34:33,015
Pierce Patchett made
you, didn't he?

1307
01:34:33,016 --> 01:34:35,558
Taught you how to
dress, talk and think.

1308
01:34:36,727 --> 01:34:38,561
I am very impressed
with the results...

1309
01:34:39,897 --> 01:34:41,356
but I need answers.

1310
01:34:41,524 --> 01:34:44,567
And if I don't get them, I'm gonna
take you and Patchett down.

1311
01:34:45,236 --> 01:34:47,904
Pierce Patchett can
take care of himself.

1312
01:34:48,948 --> 01:34:50,907
And I'm not afraid of you.

1313
01:34:51,784 --> 01:34:54,452
And you forget one
thing, lieutenant...

1314
01:34:54,787 --> 01:34:57,413
Pierce also taught me how to fuck.

1315
01:35:01,126 --> 01:35:03,151
And he tells you who to fuck. Why

1316
01:35:03,152 --> 01:35:05,421
does he have you
fucking Bud White?

1317
01:35:05,631 --> 01:35:08,299
What makes you think I'm not
seeing Bud because I want to?

1318
01:35:10,469 --> 01:35:13,805
It would be easier for you if
there was an angle, wouldn't it?

1319
01:35:14,598 --> 01:35:17,684
You're afraid of Bud because you
can't figure out how to play him.

1320
01:35:18,769 --> 01:35:21,980
He doesn't follow the same
rules of politics as you do.

1321
01:35:22,773 --> 01:35:24,566
It makes him dangerous.

1322
01:35:24,775 --> 01:35:27,443
- I can handle Bud White.
- Can you?

1323
01:35:31,448 --> 01:35:33,658
I see Bud because I want to.

1324
01:35:37,162 --> 01:35:40,498
I see Bud because he can't
hide the good inside of him.

1325
01:35:42,334 --> 01:35:45,086
I see Bud because he makes
me feel like Lynn Bracken...

1326
01:35:45,296 --> 01:35:48,673
and not some Veronica Lake
look-alike who fucks for money.

1327
01:35:50,843 --> 01:35:55,138
I see Bud because he doesn't
know how to disguise who he is.

1328
01:35:57,182 --> 01:36:00,810
I see Bud for all the ways
he's different from you.

1329
01:36:03,188 --> 01:36:05,481
Don't underestimate
me, Miss Bracken.

1330
01:36:05,816 --> 01:36:08,818
The way you've
underestimated Bud White?

1331
01:36:15,326 --> 01:36:17,994
Fucking me and fucking Bud
aren't the same thing, you know.

1332
01:36:18,495 --> 01:36:20,496
Stop talking about Bud White.

1333
01:36:45,397 --> 01:36:47,357
Come on.

1334
01:36:50,069 --> 01:36:51,361
Shit.

1335
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:06,417
Jack Vincennes.

1336
01:37:07,419 --> 01:37:09,170
It's going on midnight, Jack.

1337
01:37:09,338 --> 01:37:11,255
I need two minutes, Dudley.

1338
01:37:11,590 --> 01:37:12,799
It's important.

1339
01:37:13,425 --> 01:37:15,742
Good thing for you my
wife and daughters

1340
01:37:15,743 --> 01:37:17,720
are at the beach in Santa Barbara.

1341
01:37:20,849 --> 01:37:23,578
Do you remember
Buzz Meeks, Dudley?

1342
01:37:23,579 --> 01:37:26,020
A disgrace as a police officer.

1343
01:37:26,230 --> 01:37:28,394
Straight D fitness
reports from every CO

1344
01:37:28,395 --> 01:37:30,400
he ever served under.
What about him?

1345
01:37:31,110 --> 01:37:34,028
Twelve years ago, he was on a
Vice roust with Dick Stensland.

1346
01:37:34,238 --> 01:37:37,532
They questioned Pierce Patchett
about a blackmail scam.

1347
01:37:37,741 --> 01:37:39,909
Patchett had Sid
Hudgens photographing

1348
01:37:39,910 --> 01:37:41,911
prominent businessmen
with hookers.

1349
01:37:42,621 --> 01:37:45,581
Anyway, charges were dropped.
Insufficient evidence.

1350
01:37:45,791 --> 01:37:47,917
You were the supervising
officer on that case.

1351
01:37:48,085 --> 01:37:50,336
I was wondering if you
remember anything about it.

1352
01:37:51,588 --> 01:37:53,089
What's this all about, boyo?

1353
01:37:54,049 --> 01:37:55,750
Part of it has to
do with a murder.

1354
01:37:55,751 --> 01:37:57,593
I've been working
with Ed Exley on it.

1355
01:37:57,970 --> 01:38:00,596
You're Narco, Jack, not Homicide.

1356
01:38:00,806 --> 01:38:03,016
Since when do you work
with Edmund Exley?

1357
01:38:04,143 --> 01:38:06,602
It's a private investigation.

1358
01:38:07,104 --> 01:38:08,354
Ah.

1359
01:38:08,605 --> 01:38:11,107
I messed something up. I'm
trying to make amends.

1360
01:38:11,275 --> 01:38:13,651
Don't start trying to do
the right thing, boyo.

1361
01:38:14,153 --> 01:38:16,446
You haven't had the practise.

1362
01:38:22,661 --> 01:38:27,248
Buzz Meeks and Dick Stensland.

1363
01:38:28,792 --> 01:38:32,045
So, what does Exley make of this?

1364
01:38:32,212 --> 01:38:35,298
I haven't told him yet. I just
came from the records room.

1365
01:39:00,991 --> 01:39:03,284
Have you a valediction, boyo?

1366
01:39:09,541 --> 01:39:11,167
Rollo...

1367
01:39:12,211 --> 01:39:13,878
Tomasi.

1368
01:39:34,733 --> 01:39:38,319
Sergeant Vincennes was killed
by a .32 slug to the heart.

1369
01:39:38,529 --> 01:39:40,905
Time of death,
approximately 1 a.m.

1370
01:39:41,490 --> 01:39:43,663
Although he was
found in Echo Park,

1371
01:39:43,664 --> 01:39:46,077
forensics indicates
the body was moved.

1372
01:39:47,704 --> 01:39:51,165
I want two-man teams to scour
that entire neighbourhood.

1373
01:39:52,042 --> 01:39:56,254
Our justice must be
swift and merciless.

1374
01:39:58,423 --> 01:39:59,465
That is all.

1375
01:40:08,016 --> 01:40:10,893
Edmund, might I have
a word with you?

1376
01:40:14,398 --> 01:40:17,400
We're trying to run down a lead
on an associate of Vincennes.

1377
01:40:17,609 --> 01:40:20,444
The records check has
led to a dead end.

1378
01:40:20,737 --> 01:40:21,946
What's the name?

1379
01:40:22,239 --> 01:40:23,990
Rollo Tomasi.

1380
01:40:25,742 --> 01:40:27,743
You ever heard
Vincennes mention him?

1381
01:40:30,581 --> 01:40:32,290
No. No, I haven't.

1382
01:40:35,794 --> 01:40:36,794
Well...

1383
01:40:36,962 --> 01:40:38,963
It's probably nothing. Still...

1384
01:40:40,090 --> 01:40:42,800
keep your eyes open, boyo?

1385
01:40:52,477 --> 01:40:55,104
I know it's unlikely, but
suppose, just for a moment...

1386
01:40:55,314 --> 01:40:57,098
somebody did have
that much heroin,

1387
01:40:57,099 --> 01:40:58,733
who would they go to to move it?

1388
01:40:59,276 --> 01:41:01,036
White, in my office.

1389
01:41:01,037 --> 01:41:04,155
Captain. Look, just
give me a name.

1390
01:41:04,948 --> 01:41:06,324
Mickey Cohen.

1391
01:41:12,289 --> 01:41:13,289
Captain?

1392
01:41:13,457 --> 01:41:16,125
I could use your fearsome
habits at the Victory Motel.

1393
01:41:17,461 --> 01:41:18,711
When?

1394
01:41:19,963 --> 01:41:21,047
Now, Wendell.

1395
01:41:22,132 --> 01:41:23,341
Right.

1396
01:41:23,508 --> 01:41:25,009
Close the door, lad.

1397
01:41:32,517 --> 01:41:35,353
You're a bit of a puzzlement
to me these days, Wendell.

1398
01:41:35,729 --> 01:41:37,980
You don't seem to be your
old cruel self any more.

1399
01:41:38,649 --> 01:41:41,609
And I had such grand
plans for your future.

1400
01:41:41,818 --> 01:41:43,027
What plans?

1401
01:41:44,488 --> 01:41:48,491
You have your extracurricular
activities and I have mine.

1402
01:41:51,536 --> 01:41:54,622
We must have a clarification
session one of these days.

1403
01:41:55,707 --> 01:41:58,834
However, right now...

1404
01:41:59,336 --> 01:42:02,546
we're gonna brace a man who may
know who killed Jack Vincennes.

1405
01:42:02,881 --> 01:42:04,674
So the question is...

1406
01:42:05,008 --> 01:42:06,509
can I count on you, lad?

1407
01:42:06,677 --> 01:42:08,594
- Yes or no?
- Yes, sir.

1408
01:42:13,684 --> 01:42:15,591
I wanna know everything
you and Jack

1409
01:42:15,592 --> 01:42:17,395
Vincennes talked about last night.

1410
01:42:17,688 --> 01:42:19,689
Start with the ID on the corpse.

1411
01:42:19,898 --> 01:42:23,192
An ex-cop. Leland "Buzz" Meeks.

1412
01:42:23,402 --> 01:42:24,735
An ex-cop?

1413
01:42:25,195 --> 01:42:26,821
What did Jack say?
Did he know him?

1414
01:42:27,364 --> 01:42:29,448
Only by reputation.

1415
01:42:35,622 --> 01:42:37,832
Wendell, this is Sid Hudgens.

1416
01:42:38,041 --> 01:42:40,668
I'm willing to cooperate.
There's no need to tie me down.

1417
01:42:40,877 --> 01:42:42,586
It's for your own safety.

1418
01:42:43,588 --> 01:42:47,091
Now, what can you tell us about
Sergeant Jack Vincennes?

1419
01:42:47,259 --> 01:42:49,260
Hollywood Jack? The Big V?

1420
01:42:49,553 --> 01:42:52,513
I can tell you he's on the
night train to the big adiós.

1421
01:42:56,685 --> 01:42:58,410
I didn't have anything
to do with him

1422
01:42:58,411 --> 01:43:00,271
getting killed, if
that's what you mean.

1423
01:43:00,564 --> 01:43:02,445
But you were business associates.

1424
01:43:02,446 --> 01:43:04,483
What's that got to
do with anything?

1425
01:43:05,736 --> 01:43:08,571
Okay, okay, so we worked together.

1426
01:43:09,031 --> 01:43:11,073
It was an information exchange.

1427
01:43:11,283 --> 01:43:13,784
I got him first-class collars,
he got me good stories.

1428
01:43:13,952 --> 01:43:15,745
We were friends, for Christ sake.

1429
01:43:15,912 --> 01:43:17,413
We'll drop that for the moment.

1430
01:43:17,914 --> 01:43:19,749
Care to comment on
Pierce Patchett?

1431
01:43:19,916 --> 01:43:21,674
Patchett? You think
he had something

1432
01:43:21,675 --> 01:43:23,336
to do with Vincennes getting iced?

1433
01:43:23,503 --> 01:43:28,549
Wendell, I'd like full and docile
cooperation on every topic.

1434
01:43:28,717 --> 01:43:31,218
Okay, okay, okay. All right.

1435
01:43:32,763 --> 01:43:35,681
Everybody knows that Patchett's
worth a boatload of greenbacks.

1436
01:43:36,099 --> 01:43:37,975
But the man has hobbies too.

1437
01:43:38,185 --> 01:43:40,770
He bankrolls B-movies
under the table.

1438
01:43:41,188 --> 01:43:42,813
And try this one on:

1439
01:43:43,023 --> 01:43:45,274
He's rumoured to be a
periodic heroin sniffer.

1440
01:43:45,442 --> 01:43:48,527
All in all, a powerful
behind-the-scenes strange-o.

1441
01:43:48,695 --> 01:43:50,696
- And?
- And what?

1442
01:43:54,785 --> 01:43:58,579
Reciprocity, Mr Hudgens, is the
key to every relationship.

1443
01:44:01,708 --> 01:44:03,292
He runs call girls.

1444
01:44:05,212 --> 01:44:08,297
Cousin tail fixed up to
look like movie stars.

1445
01:44:11,051 --> 01:44:13,803
- And?
- Blackmail shit.

1446
01:44:13,970 --> 01:44:17,681
In my car, in the
trunk, under the rug...

1447
01:44:17,974 --> 01:44:20,094
Patchett got me to
photograph this cop

1448
01:44:20,095 --> 01:44:22,269
screwing this gorgeous
slut named Lynn.

1449
01:44:22,437 --> 01:44:24,563
Looks just like Veronica Lake.

1450
01:44:24,731 --> 01:44:28,818
Wendell. Wendell. Leave him
be. I said, leave him be.

1451
01:44:28,985 --> 01:44:31,005
Get him off me. Get
him away from me.

1452
01:44:31,006 --> 01:44:32,571
Back off, Wendell. Back off.

1453
01:45:16,783 --> 01:45:19,244
I wouldn't trade places
with Edmund Exley

1454
01:45:19,245 --> 01:45:21,704
right now for all the
whiskey in Ireland.

1455
01:45:22,622 --> 01:45:23,664
Dudley.

1456
01:45:25,792 --> 01:45:29,253
Dudley, I thought you were gonna
let the dumb bastard kill me.

1457
01:45:29,421 --> 01:45:32,590
And you, learn to pull your
punches a little better.

1458
01:45:32,799 --> 01:45:34,884
You can uncuff me now, fellas.

1459
01:45:40,515 --> 01:45:42,183
Fellas...

1460
01:45:42,350 --> 01:45:44,685
Dudley, we had a deal.

1461
01:45:44,853 --> 01:45:46,520
You, me and Patchett,
we're a team.

1462
01:45:51,568 --> 01:45:52,902
Hushush.

1463
01:45:54,070 --> 01:45:56,071
- Anything?
- Nothing.

1464
01:45:56,239 --> 01:45:59,074
Meeks never made an arrest the
entire time he worked Vice?

1465
01:45:59,242 --> 01:46:01,243
Someone must've pulled the files.

1466
01:46:03,830 --> 01:46:05,748
What about the daily report books?

1467
01:46:05,916 --> 01:46:07,750
They'd be buried in the basement.

1468
01:46:07,918 --> 01:46:09,168
Find them.

1469
01:46:40,158 --> 01:46:41,742
Did you talk to Exley?

1470
01:46:42,244 --> 01:46:43,994
Come in out of the rain.

1471
01:46:45,997 --> 01:46:48,082
I wanna know what
happened with Exley.

1472
01:46:49,834 --> 01:46:51,168
Just come in.

1473
01:46:52,546 --> 01:46:55,130
Are you gonna tell me what
happened with you and Exley?

1474
01:46:55,757 --> 01:46:57,091
We talked.

1475
01:46:57,676 --> 01:46:59,760
- So tell me about him.
- Later.

1476
01:46:59,928 --> 01:47:02,888
No. Now.

1477
01:47:05,433 --> 01:47:12,106
You fucked him.

1478
01:47:12,857 --> 01:47:14,900
I thought I was helping you.

1479
01:48:05,910 --> 01:48:08,203
Bud, I'm glad you're here.
I need you to see this.

1480
01:48:17,756 --> 01:48:18,797
Wait.

1481
01:48:45,617 --> 01:48:47,159
Dudley killed Jack.

1482
01:48:47,786 --> 01:48:49,620
He wants you to kill me.

1483
01:48:52,707 --> 01:48:54,708
He showed you the
photo, didn't he?

1484
01:48:55,543 --> 01:48:56,585
Didn't he?

1485
01:48:59,214 --> 01:49:02,675
Think. Goddamn you, think.

1486
01:49:03,927 --> 01:49:06,095
Get the fuck out of here.

1487
01:49:18,733 --> 01:49:20,109
Dudley.

1488
01:49:21,486 --> 01:49:23,654
I checked the daily report books.

1489
01:49:24,823 --> 01:49:28,283
Dudley, Buzz Meeks and
Stensland go way back.

1490
01:49:31,830 --> 01:49:33,747
I knew Stensland lied to me.

1491
01:49:36,751 --> 01:49:39,837
Lefferts' mother ID'd Stensland
as Lefferts' boyfriend.

1492
01:49:41,589 --> 01:49:43,755
Stensland pretended he didn't know

1493
01:49:43,756 --> 01:49:46,176
Meeks or her the
night that I met...

1494
01:49:47,512 --> 01:49:48,971
Lynn.

1495
01:49:49,597 --> 01:49:51,181
Stensland and Meeks...

1496
01:49:51,683 --> 01:49:53,350
what the hell were they up to?

1497
01:49:54,144 --> 01:49:57,563
I don't know, but I think Stens
killed Meeks over heroin.

1498
01:49:58,022 --> 01:49:59,148
What heroin?

1499
01:50:05,113 --> 01:50:08,699
Johnny Stompanato told me that
Meeks had heroin for sale.

1500
01:50:09,033 --> 01:50:10,701
Meeks ends up dead.

1501
01:50:11,202 --> 01:50:13,328
Stensland dies at the Nite Owl.

1502
01:50:14,289 --> 01:50:16,039
It wasn't the Negroes.

1503
01:50:17,041 --> 01:50:19,001
The rape victim lied
in her statement.

1504
01:50:19,544 --> 01:50:23,172
The first guys to the Mercury
coupe were Breuning and Carlisle.

1505
01:50:23,381 --> 01:50:24,882
Dudley's guys.

1506
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:27,092
They planted the shotguns.

1507
01:50:27,302 --> 01:50:28,970
And they'd have
killed the Negroes,

1508
01:50:28,971 --> 01:50:30,637
too, if Jack and I
hadn't shown up.

1509
01:50:31,639 --> 01:50:34,808
Dudley framed them because they
were Negroes and had records.

1510
01:50:35,143 --> 01:50:37,728
He knew there'd be no
questions asked...

1511
01:50:39,147 --> 01:50:41,523
if they were killed
resisting arrest.

1512
01:50:42,567 --> 01:50:44,943
Somehow this is all
connected to Jack's angle.

1513
01:50:45,570 --> 01:50:47,404
Sid Hudgens...

1514
01:50:47,572 --> 01:50:49,740
the pictures to
blackmail Ellis Loew...

1515
01:50:50,825 --> 01:50:52,493
A kid got murdered.

1516
01:50:53,161 --> 01:50:56,205
If we're gonna figure this
out, we need to work together.

1517
01:51:01,085 --> 01:51:02,753
Why are you doing this?

1518
01:51:04,756 --> 01:51:06,590
The Nite Owl made you.

1519
01:51:08,426 --> 01:51:10,052
You wanna tear all that down?

1520
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:13,430
With a wrecking ball.

1521
01:51:13,932 --> 01:51:15,766
You wanna help me swing it?

1522
01:51:28,071 --> 01:51:30,072
Let's go see Ellis Loew.

1523
01:51:30,615 --> 01:51:33,367
Find out what the
district attorney knows.

1524
01:51:38,581 --> 01:51:39,832
May I...?

1525
01:51:39,999 --> 01:51:43,043
Hey. You can't go in there.

1526
01:51:45,296 --> 01:51:47,047
Want me to call the
police, Mr Loew?

1527
01:51:47,215 --> 01:51:48,549
Ask for Captain Dudley Smith.

1528
01:51:48,716 --> 01:51:50,791
Tell him we're having
a discussion about

1529
01:51:50,792 --> 01:51:52,511
the death of an actor at a motel.

1530
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:53,846
These are the police.

1531
01:52:00,562 --> 01:52:01,770
What do you want?

1532
01:52:01,980 --> 01:52:04,158
I want DA bureau
men to tail Dudley

1533
01:52:04,159 --> 01:52:06,275
Smith and Patchett 24 hours a day.

1534
01:52:06,442 --> 01:52:08,394
I want you to get a
judge to authorise

1535
01:52:08,395 --> 01:52:09,945
wiretaps on their home phones.

1536
01:52:10,154 --> 01:52:12,447
I want authorisation to
check their bank records.

1537
01:52:12,991 --> 01:52:14,449
On what evidence?

1538
01:52:14,993 --> 01:52:16,660
Call it a hunch.

1539
01:52:17,912 --> 01:52:19,621
Absolutely not.

1540
01:52:19,831 --> 01:52:22,791
Dudley Smith is a highly decorated
member of this department.

1541
01:52:23,001 --> 01:52:25,210
I'm not gonna smear his
and Patchett's name...

1542
01:52:25,378 --> 01:52:26,628
Without what?

1543
01:52:27,005 --> 01:52:29,089
Them smearing yours first?

1544
01:52:29,257 --> 01:52:31,100
What do they have?
Pictures of you and

1545
01:52:31,101 --> 01:52:32,801
Matt Reynolds with
your pants down?

1546
01:52:35,179 --> 01:52:36,263
You have any proof?

1547
01:52:36,931 --> 01:52:38,640
The proof had his throat slit.

1548
01:52:40,018 --> 01:52:42,185
So far, you're not denying it.

1549
01:52:43,521 --> 01:52:45,480
I'm not gonna dignify
this with answers.

1550
01:52:45,690 --> 01:52:48,150
Now, if you gentlemen
will excuse me...

1551
01:52:48,359 --> 01:52:50,146
I have a press conference for Jack

1552
01:52:50,147 --> 01:52:52,195
Vincennes that I
have to prepare for.

1553
01:53:02,874 --> 01:53:07,336
Unless you came in to wipe my
ass, I believe we're through.

1554
01:53:11,382 --> 01:53:16,345
Don't pull that good-cop-bad-cop
crap. I practically invented it.

1555
01:53:16,512 --> 01:53:18,805
So what if some
homo actor is dead.

1556
01:53:18,973 --> 01:53:21,725
Boys, girls, 10 of them get off
the bus to L.A. every day.

1557
01:53:29,901 --> 01:53:33,445
- Pull him off me, Exley.
- I don't know how.

1558
01:53:36,324 --> 01:53:38,366
I know you think you're
the A-number-one

1559
01:53:38,367 --> 01:53:39,910
hotshot, but here's the juice.

1560
01:53:40,078 --> 01:53:42,871
If I take you out, 10 lawyers
will take your place tomorrow.

1561
01:53:43,039 --> 01:53:44,581
They just won't come on a bus.

1562
01:53:58,846 --> 01:54:00,764
All right. Okay.

1563
01:54:01,182 --> 01:54:05,435
Dudley and Patchett,
they... Oh, my God.

1564
01:54:05,895 --> 01:54:07,966
I wouldn't play ball,
so they set me up. I

1565
01:54:07,967 --> 01:54:09,940
gave in, but the kid
heard everything...

1566
01:54:11,776 --> 01:54:13,819
- so they killed him.
- Why?

1567
01:54:13,987 --> 01:54:15,697
What are Dudley and
Patchett up to?

1568
01:54:15,698 --> 01:54:17,406
Taking over Mickey
Cohen's rackets.

1569
01:54:17,865 --> 01:54:22,077
Because of those pictures,
I couldn't prosecute them.

1570
01:54:22,245 --> 01:54:24,454
Oh, Jesus. Help me up.

1571
01:54:33,756 --> 01:54:36,758
Is that how you used to
run the good-cop-bad-cop?

1572
01:54:38,553 --> 01:54:40,929
Patchett?

1573
01:55:15,214 --> 01:55:18,633
Looks like his bodyguard had
a conflict of interest.

1574
01:55:24,307 --> 01:55:25,640
Suicide note.

1575
01:55:25,808 --> 01:55:28,290
Says he killed Jack
because Jack had

1576
01:55:28,291 --> 01:55:30,437
figured out a pornography scam.

1577
01:55:30,605 --> 01:55:32,397
Slicing himself open
wasn't his idea.

1578
01:55:34,150 --> 01:55:37,903
- Two of his fingers are broken.
- They must have held him there.

1579
01:55:38,988 --> 01:55:40,906
Or drugged him.

1580
01:55:43,326 --> 01:55:45,827
I'd say Dudley's tying
up his loose ends.

1581
01:55:45,995 --> 01:55:49,081
Patchett's dead. He
sent you after me.

1582
01:55:50,833 --> 01:55:52,125
Lynn.

1583
01:55:53,044 --> 01:55:54,086
West Hollywood.

1584
01:55:54,253 --> 01:55:57,339
- They're closer than we are.
- I'll get the car. Keys.

1585
01:56:04,097 --> 01:56:07,516
Hey. We took her to the
station for safekeeping.

1586
01:56:08,518 --> 01:56:11,770
Hold her as Joan Smith. And no
one sees her unless I okay it.

1587
01:56:12,855 --> 01:56:16,858
Somebody worked her over.
She wouldn't say who.

1588
01:56:21,697 --> 01:56:23,031
- See you, Exley.
- Sure.

1589
01:56:26,452 --> 01:56:30,330
- We should talk to Lynn.
- You do it.

1590
01:56:30,581 --> 01:56:31,665
What are you gonna do?

1591
01:56:35,211 --> 01:56:37,671
I'm gonna talk to Sid Hudgens.

1592
01:56:37,839 --> 01:56:40,757
Compliment him on his performance
at the Victory Motel.

1593
01:56:40,925 --> 01:56:45,303
- Remember, Bud, we need evidence.
- I'll get the evidence.

1594
01:56:58,192 --> 01:57:00,193
Are you okay?

1595
01:57:01,904 --> 01:57:03,905
You okay?

1596
01:57:13,583 --> 01:57:15,250
Bud hates himself for what he did.

1597
01:57:16,794 --> 01:57:18,545
I know how he feels.

1598
01:57:21,215 --> 01:57:23,717
I need to know what you can
give me on Dudley Smith.

1599
01:57:26,095 --> 01:57:29,097
He's a police captain. He's
in business with Patchett.

1600
01:57:29,265 --> 01:57:30,557
I've never heard of him.

1601
01:57:35,062 --> 01:57:37,522
Do you have some
place you can stay?

1602
01:57:38,274 --> 01:57:40,192
I'll be okay.

1603
01:57:46,490 --> 01:57:49,117
Nobody goes in
without official ID.

1604
01:57:53,456 --> 01:57:55,707
He's okay. Let him through.

1605
01:57:58,836 --> 01:58:00,545
What happened?

1606
01:58:00,713 --> 01:58:03,590
Somebody beat him to death
and stole a bunch of files.

1607
01:58:03,758 --> 01:58:06,134
Must have dug up garbage
on the wrong guy.

1608
01:58:06,302 --> 01:58:09,137
We got it narrowed down
to 1,000 suspects.

1609
01:58:09,305 --> 01:58:11,640
Sergeant White...

1610
01:58:11,807 --> 01:58:13,308
Dispatch got a call for you.

1611
01:58:13,476 --> 01:58:16,978
Lieutenant Exley wants you to
meet him at the Victory Motel.

1612
01:58:50,596 --> 01:58:52,681
You wanted to meet here?

1613
01:58:54,267 --> 01:58:56,764
You called it. I
thought Hudgens was...

1614
01:58:56,765 --> 01:58:57,894
Hudgens is dead.

1615
01:59:08,823 --> 01:59:10,824
Let's get out of here.

1616
01:59:17,748 --> 01:59:19,457
It's too late.

1617
02:00:08,674 --> 02:00:11,092
You figured this was a setup
and showed up anyway?

1618
02:00:11,260 --> 02:00:13,428
A lot of bad stuff happened here.

1619
02:00:13,596 --> 02:00:16,514
It's as good a place
as any for it to end.

1620
02:00:25,691 --> 02:00:27,484
Here. Clip.

1621
02:00:32,156 --> 02:00:35,700
All I ever wanted was to
measure up to my father.

1622
02:00:36,118 --> 02:00:37,911
Now's your chance.

1623
02:00:39,705 --> 02:00:42,332
He died in the line
of duty, didn't he?

1624
02:01:41,517 --> 02:01:42,642
Bud.

1625
02:02:40,826 --> 02:02:42,285
Goddamn it.

1626
02:03:42,596 --> 02:03:45,807
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1627
02:04:03,993 --> 02:04:05,910
Come on. Easy. Come on.

1628
02:04:12,751 --> 02:04:14,335
Move.

1629
02:04:36,275 --> 02:04:37,442
Rollo Tomasi.

1630
02:04:41,280 --> 02:04:44,198
- Who is he?
- You are.

1631
02:04:46,827 --> 02:04:49,370
You're the guy who
gets away with it.

1632
02:04:52,666 --> 02:04:55,126
Jack knew it and so do I.

1633
02:05:21,236 --> 02:05:26,115
Are you gonna shoot
me or arrest me?

1634
02:05:31,455 --> 02:05:32,497
Good lad.

1635
02:05:33,582 --> 02:05:35,249
Always the politician.

1636
02:05:36,168 --> 02:05:38,419
Let me do the talking.

1637
02:05:38,587 --> 02:05:42,548
After I'm done, they'll make
you chief of detectives.

1638
02:06:09,493 --> 02:06:13,996
Hold up your badge so they'll
know you're a policeman.

1639
02:07:04,006 --> 02:07:07,300
You think you can talk your
way out of this, lieutenant?

1640
02:07:09,428 --> 02:07:10,720
No...

1641
02:07:10,888 --> 02:07:13,222
but I think I can tell the truth.

1642
02:07:13,390 --> 02:07:15,975
During our investigation...

1643
02:07:16,393 --> 02:07:20,021
of events surrounding
the Nite Owl case...

1644
02:07:20,647 --> 02:07:23,775
Jack Vincennes, Bud White and
I learned the following.

1645
02:07:24,777 --> 02:07:27,236
Your golden boy's throwing
his whole life away.

1646
02:07:27,404 --> 02:07:29,822
The three Nite Owl suspects...

1647
02:07:29,990 --> 02:07:32,950
while guilty of
kidnapping and rape...

1648
02:07:33,243 --> 02:07:36,746
were innocent of the multiple
homicides at the Nite Owl.

1649
02:07:37,539 --> 02:07:39,499
The actual gunmen
were most likely...

1650
02:07:39,666 --> 02:07:42,045
Los Angeles Police
Department officers

1651
02:07:42,046 --> 02:07:44,545
Michael Breuning and
William Carlisle...

1652
02:07:44,713 --> 02:07:46,714
and a third man...

1653
02:07:46,965 --> 02:07:50,885
who may or may not have
been Captain Dudley Smith.

1654
02:07:51,637 --> 02:07:53,387
The objective:

1655
02:07:54,097 --> 02:07:56,641
The elimination of another
police officer...

1656
02:07:56,809 --> 02:07:59,060
Richard Stensland...

1657
02:07:59,645 --> 02:08:05,566
who, along with former L.A.P.D.
Officer Leland "Buzz" Meeks...

1658
02:08:05,734 --> 02:08:09,904
also committed multiple homicides
on behalf of Captain Smith...

1659
02:08:10,072 --> 02:08:13,908
and then betrayed him over
25 pounds of heroin...

1660
02:08:15,160 --> 02:08:17,245
the retrieval of which...

1661
02:08:17,412 --> 02:08:20,915
was the ultimate motivation
behind the Nite Owl killings.

1662
02:08:23,627 --> 02:08:27,255
Beginning with the incarceration
of Mickey Cohen...

1663
02:08:27,422 --> 02:08:30,336
Captain Smith has
been assuming control

1664
02:08:30,337 --> 02:08:32,885
of organised crime in Los Angeles.

1665
02:08:33,053 --> 02:08:34,762
This includes the
assassinations...

1666
02:08:34,930 --> 02:08:37,598
of an unknown number of
Mickey Cohen lieutenants...

1667
02:08:38,559 --> 02:08:42,019
the systematic blackmail
of city officials...

1668
02:08:43,230 --> 02:08:48,109
and the murders of Susan Lefferts,
Pierce Patchett, Sid Hudgens...

1669
02:08:49,111 --> 02:08:51,737
and Sergeant Jack Vincennes.

1670
02:08:54,449 --> 02:08:57,118
Captain Smith admitted
as much to me...

1671
02:08:57,911 --> 02:09:02,373
before I shot him at
the Victory Motel.

1672
02:09:04,251 --> 02:09:06,085
That's it.

1673
02:09:07,796 --> 02:09:09,839
Well...

1674
02:09:10,257 --> 02:09:12,091
the press is gonna
have a field day.

1675
02:09:14,011 --> 02:09:17,930
This... Christ, it'll stain
the department for years.

1676
02:09:18,098 --> 02:09:19,974
Decades.

1677
02:09:20,475 --> 02:09:23,394
If we can get the
kid to play ball...

1678
02:09:24,104 --> 02:09:26,272
who's to say what happened?

1679
02:09:26,982 --> 02:09:29,483
Maybe Dudley Smith died a hero.

1680
02:09:29,651 --> 02:09:31,986
- Good idea.
- If we get the press to play.

1681
02:09:39,953 --> 02:09:43,414
You wanna tell me what
you're smiling about?

1682
02:09:48,295 --> 02:09:49,420
A hero.

1683
02:09:50,172 --> 02:09:52,173
How'd he know what
we're talking about?

1684
02:09:52,341 --> 02:09:54,258
He couldn't have heard us.

1685
02:09:56,303 --> 02:09:57,345
And?

1686
02:09:57,512 --> 02:09:59,680
In this situation...

1687
02:09:59,848 --> 02:10:02,183
you'll need more than one.

1688
02:10:08,440 --> 02:10:11,525
It is with great pleasure
that I present this award...

1689
02:10:11,693 --> 02:10:13,611
to Detective Lieutenant
Edmund Exley...

1690
02:10:14,196 --> 02:10:17,406
two-time Medal of
Valour recipient.

1691
02:10:26,291 --> 02:10:30,544
Next year, the L.A.P.D. will
move into its new facility.

1692
02:10:30,712 --> 02:10:32,463
With leaders like Edmund Exley...

1693
02:10:32,631 --> 02:10:35,967
the image of fat cops stealing
apples will be left behind...

1694
02:10:36,134 --> 02:10:39,637
and Los Angeles will finally have
the police force it deserves.

1695
02:10:53,819 --> 02:10:55,736
You just couldn't resist.

1696
02:10:56,196 --> 02:10:58,489
They're using me, so for
a while, I'm using them.

1697
02:11:00,742 --> 02:11:02,118
Come on.

1698
02:11:21,013 --> 02:11:22,680
Hey.

1699
02:11:36,820 --> 02:11:39,030
Thanks for the push.

1700
02:11:48,623 --> 02:11:50,082
Yeah.

1701
02:11:59,593 --> 02:12:02,303
Congratulations, Lieutenant Exley.

1702
02:12:05,265 --> 02:12:07,600
Some men get the world...

1703
02:12:07,768 --> 02:12:11,145
others get ex-hookers
and a trip to Arizona.

02:12:23,033 --> 02:12:26,827
- Bye.
- Bye.
