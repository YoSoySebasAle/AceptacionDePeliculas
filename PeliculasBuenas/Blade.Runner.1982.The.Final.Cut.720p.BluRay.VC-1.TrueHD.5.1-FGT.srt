00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:35,610
<i>Next subject: Kowalski,</i>

2
00:04:36,027 --> 00:04:37,987
<i>Engineer, waste disposal.</i>

3
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:41,074
<i>File section: New employee, six days.</i>

4
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,868
<i>Calling Mr. Webber.</i>

5
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:46,171
Come in.
<i>Please report to Zone A Sector 9.</i>

6
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:54,837
<i>Replication Center Level 9,
we have a B1 security alert.</i>

7
00:04:55,004 --> 00:04:57,590
<i>Stand by for ID check, please.</i>

8
00:04:58,216 --> 00:04:59,258
Sit down.

9
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:03,054
<i>Replication Center Level 9,
we have a B1 security alert.</i>

10
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:04,263
<i>Stand by for...</i>

11
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,723
Care if I talk?

12
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:08,059
I'm kind of nervous when I take tests.

13
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:09,861
Just please don't move.

14
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:12,297
Oh, sorry.

15
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:18,326
I already had an IQ test this year.

16
00:05:18,727 --> 00:05:20,062
I don't think I've had...
Reaction time,

17
00:05:20,063 --> 00:05:21,756
is a factor in this,
so please pay attention.

18
00:05:21,823 --> 00:05:23,509
Now answer as quickly as you can.

19
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:25,911
Sure.

20
00:05:27,604 --> 00:05:29,272
1187 at Hunterwasser.

21
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:30,482
That's the hotel.

22
00:05:30,549 --> 00:05:31,081
What?

23
00:05:31,282 --> 00:05:32,376
Where I live.

24
00:05:32,943 --> 00:05:34,353
Nice place?
Yeah, sure I guess.

25
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,188
Is that part of the test?

26
00:05:36,655 --> 00:05:38,924
No. Just warming you up.
That's all.

27
00:05:40,242 --> 00:05:41,836
It's not fancy or anything.

28
00:05:43,662 --> 00:05:44,555
You're in a desert,

29
00:05:44,556 --> 00:05:46,414
walking along in the sand,
when all of...

30
00:05:46,415 --> 00:05:47,457
Is this the test, now?

31
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,787
Yes. You're in a desert,
walking along in the sand,

32
00:05:49,788 --> 00:05:51,545
when all of a sudden you look down...
What one?

33
00:05:52,212 --> 00:05:53,464
What?
What desert?

34
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:56,925
Doesn't make any difference what desert.
It's completely hypothetical.

35
00:05:57,092 --> 00:05:59,028
But how come I'd be there?
Maybe you're fed up.

36
00:05:59,094 --> 00:06:00,730
Maybe you wanna be by yourself.
Who knows?

37
00:06:02,597 --> 00:06:04,324
You look down and see a tortoise, Leon.

38
00:06:04,391 --> 00:06:06,113
It's crawling towards you...
Tortoise?

39
00:06:06,614 --> 00:06:07,621
What's that?

40
00:06:10,906 --> 00:06:12,332
You know what a turtle is?

41
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,282
Of course.

42
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,635
Same thing.

43
00:06:15,202 --> 00:06:16,629
I've never seen a turtle.

44
00:06:19,656 --> 00:06:20,858
But I understand what you mean.

45
00:06:21,325 --> 00:06:23,936
You reach down and you flip
the tortoise over on its back, Leon.

46
00:06:24,202 --> 00:06:26,080
Do you make up these questions,
Mr. Holden?

47
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:28,639
Or do they write them down for you?

48
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:31,868
The tortoise lays on its back,
its belly baking in the sun,

49
00:06:31,934 --> 00:06:34,679
beating its legs,
trying to turn itself over, but it can't...

50
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:36,447
not without your help.

51
00:06:36,814 --> 00:06:39,108
You're not helping.
What do you mean I'm not helping?

52
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,710
I mean you're not helping.

53
00:06:41,252 --> 00:06:42,436
Why is that Leon?

54
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:52,731
They're just questions Leon,

55
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:56,376
In answer to your query,
they're written down for me.

56
00:06:57,043 --> 00:07:00,639
It's a test designed to provoke
an emotional response.

57
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:05,185
Shall we continue?

58
00:07:07,053 --> 00:07:08,818
Describe in single words,

59
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:11,348
only the good things that
come into your mind,

60
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:13,226
about your mother.

61
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:15,037
My mother?
Yeah.

62
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:18,890
Let me tell you about my mother.

63
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,544
<i>A new life awaits you
in the Off-world colonies.</i>

64
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,754
<i>The chance to begin again,</i>

65
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:45,967
<i>in a golden land of opportunity
and adventure.</i>

66
00:08:11,868 --> 00:08:16,080
<i>A new life awaits you
in the Off-world colonies.</i>

67
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:18,249
<i>The chance to begin again,</i>

68
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:22,044
<i>in a golden land of
opportunity and adventure.</i>

69
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:29,310
<i>The custom-tailored genetically
engineered humanoid Replicant,</i>

70
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:32,522
<i>designed especially for your needs.</i>

71
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,826
<i>So come on America.</i>

72
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,762
Give me four.

73
00:08:42,064 --> 00:08:43,858
No, four. Two, two. Four.

74
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,821
And noodles.

75
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,460
Hey.

76
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,680
He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.

77
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:17,058
Got the wrong guy, pal.

78
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:24,306
He say you Blade Runner.

79
00:09:24,473 --> 00:09:25,733
Tell him I'm eating.

80
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,109
Captain Bryant...

81
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:31,965
Bryant?

82
00:09:48,313 --> 00:09:49,399
<i>Yellow 3.</i>

83
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,635
<i>Climb and maintain 4000.</i>

84
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:56,358
<i>Final descent.</i>

85
00:10:57,325 --> 00:10:58,644
<i>Now on glide path.</i>

86
00:10:58,845 --> 00:11:00,086
<i>Mark course.</i>

87
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:01,996
<i>Over the landing threshold.</i>

88
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:22,224
Hi, Deck.

89
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:23,484
Bryant.

90
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:25,822
You wouldn't have come
if I just asked you to.

91
00:11:26,323 --> 00:11:27,346
Sit down, pal.

92
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:30,520
Come on, don't be an asshole, Deckard.

93
00:11:30,621 --> 00:11:32,943
I've got four skin-jobs
walking the streets.

94
00:11:49,251 --> 00:11:50,771
They jumped a shuttle Off-world,

95
00:11:51,072 --> 00:11:52,638
killed the crew and passengers.

96
00:11:52,905 --> 00:11:55,228
They found the shuttle drifting off the coast

97
00:11:55,229 --> 00:11:56,876
two weeks ago so we know they're around.

98
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:00,121
Embarrassing.

99
00:12:00,388 --> 00:12:01,585
No sir not embarrassing.

100
00:12:01,886 --> 00:12:03,849
Because no one's ever gonna
find out they're down here.

101
00:12:04,016 --> 00:12:06,202
Because you're gonna spot them
and you gonna air them out.

102
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:08,062
I don't work here anymore.

103
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:10,523
Give it to Holden.

104
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:12,583
He's good.
I did.

105
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,694
He can breathe okay
as long as nobody unplugs him.

106
00:12:16,529 --> 00:12:17,858
He's not good enough.

107
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:19,440
Not good as you.

108
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:21,134
I need you Deck.

109
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,736
Now this is a bad one, the worst yet.

110
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,489
I need the old Blade Runner.

111
00:12:26,956 --> 00:12:28,441
I need your magic.

112
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,953
I was quit when I come in here Bryant.

113
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:35,164
I'm twice as quit now.

114
00:12:35,673 --> 00:12:36,984
Stop right where you are.

115
00:12:37,085 --> 00:12:38,551
You know the score pal?

116
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:41,070
If you're not cop, you're little people.

117
00:12:53,566 --> 00:12:54,784
No choice?

118
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:57,787
No choice pal.

119
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,607
<i>I already had an IQ test this year.</i>

120
00:13:02,074 --> 00:13:03,734
<i>I don't think I've ever had one of these.</i>

121
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,787
<i>Reaction time is a factor,
so please pay attention.</i>

122
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:09,081
<i>Answer as quickly as you can.
Yeah, sure.</i>

123
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:11,751
<i>1187 at Hunterwasser.</i>

124
00:13:12,418 --> 00:13:13,794
<i>Yeah. That's the hotel.</i>

125
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:14,635
<i>What?</i>

126
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,356
<i>Where I live.</i>

127
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:17,159
<i>Nice place?</i>

128
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,632
<i>Yeah sure, I guess.</i>

129
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,802
There was an escape from
the Off-world colonies two weeks ago.

130
00:13:21,869 --> 00:13:22,727
Six Replicants.

131
00:13:22,728 --> 00:13:24,330
Three male, three female.

132
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:27,099
They slaughtered 23 people
and jumped a shuttle.

133
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:29,602
An aerial patrol spotted
the ship off the coast.

134
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:31,520
No crew, no sight of them.

135
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:34,815
Three nights ago they tried to break
into Tyrell Corporation.

136
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:37,359
Two of them got fried running
through an electrical field.

137
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:38,945
We lost the others.

138
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:44,016
On the possibility they might try
to infiltrate as employees.

139
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:48,454
I had Holden go over and run
Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers.

140
00:13:48,621 --> 00:13:50,414
Looks like he got himself one.

141
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:52,669
<i>So you look down and
you see a tortoise.</i>

142
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,210
<i>It's crawling towards you.</i>

143
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:55,644
<i>Tortoise? What's that?</i>
That's Leon.

144
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:57,880
Ammunition loader on intergalactic runs.

145
00:13:58,047 --> 00:14:01,133
He can lift 400-pound atomic loads
all day and night.

146
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,719
The only way you can hurt him
is to kill him.

147
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:06,044
I don't get it. What do they
risk coming back to Earth for?

148
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,607
That's unusual. Why...

149
00:14:08,474 --> 00:14:10,985
What do they want
out of the Tyrell Corporation?

150
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:13,446
Well, you tell me, pal.
That's what you're here for.

151
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:26,642
What's this?

152
00:14:26,743 --> 00:14:29,078
Nexus 6. Roy Batty.

153
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:31,205
Incept date: 2016.

154
00:14:31,372 --> 00:14:34,124
Combat model.
Optimum self-sufficiency.

155
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:37,019
Probably the leader.

156
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,408
This is Zhora.

157
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:45,135
She's trained for
an Off-world kick murder squad.

158
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,874
Talk about Beauty and the Beast.

159
00:14:48,075 --> 00:14:49,207
She's both.

160
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:55,923
The fourth skin-job is Pris,

161
00:14:56,324 --> 00:14:57,873
a basic pleasure model.

162
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,360
The standard item for military clubs
in the outer colonies.

163
00:15:02,987 --> 00:15:06,182
They were designed to copy human beings
in every way except their emotions.

164
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:11,704
The designers reckoned after a few years they
might develop their own emotional responses.

165
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:15,291
Oh, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.

166
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,710
So they built in a fail-safe device.

167
00:15:17,776 --> 00:15:19,011
Which is what?

168
00:15:19,012 --> 00:15:20,513
Four-year lifespan.

169
00:15:27,261 --> 00:15:30,889
Now, there's a Nexus 6
over at the Tyrell Corporation.

170
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:33,041
I want you to go put the machine on it.

171
00:15:33,342 --> 00:15:34,927
And if the machine doesn't work?

172
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,045
Do you like our owl?

173
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:12,758
It's artificial?

174
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:15,620
Of course it is.

175
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:18,789
Must be expensive.

176
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:21,894
Very.

177
00:17:22,195 --> 00:17:23,602
I'm Rachael.

178
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:25,562
Deckard.

179
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:31,110
It seems you feel our work
is not a benefit to the public.

180
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,083
Replicants are like any other machine.

181
00:17:35,084 --> 00:17:36,841
They're either a benefit or a hazard.

182
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:39,360
If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.

183
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,605
May I ask you a personal question?

184
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:45,732
Sure.

185
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:52,823
Have you ever retired a human
by mistake?

186
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:56,160
No.

187
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,040
But in your position, that is a risk.

188
00:17:58,241 --> 00:17:59,964
Is this to be an empathy test?

189
00:18:01,498 --> 00:18:04,743
Capillary dilation
of the so-called blush response?

190
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:08,122
Fluctuation of the pupil.

191
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,126
Involuntary dilation of the iris.

192
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:16,405
We call it Voight-Kampff for short.

193
00:18:17,473 --> 00:18:19,516
Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.

194
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:21,836
Demonstrate it.

195
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,605
I wanna see it work.

196
00:18:24,872 --> 00:18:25,945
Where's the subject?

197
00:18:25,946 --> 00:18:27,099
I wanna see it work on a person.

198
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,927
I wanna see a negative before
I provide you with a positive.

199
00:18:30,694 --> 00:18:31,962
What's that gonna prove?

200
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:34,665
Indulge me.

201
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:36,634
On you?

202
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:38,435
Try her.

203
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:45,368
It's too bright in here.

204
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:24,941
Do you mind if I smoke?

205
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:27,584
It won't affect the test.

206
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:32,523
All right, I'm gonna ask you
a series of questions.

207
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,810
Just relax and answer them
as simply as you can.

208
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,102
It's your birthday.

209
00:19:45,703 --> 00:19:47,271
Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.

210
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:48,931
I wouldn't accept it.

211
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:53,019
Also, I'd report the person
who gave it to me to the police.

212
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:58,282
You've got a little boy.
He shows you his butterfly collection,

213
00:19:58,448 --> 00:19:59,684
plus the killing jar.

214
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,289
I'd take him to the doctor.

215
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:12,671
You're watching television.

216
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:15,549
Suddenly you realize there's a wasp
crawling on your arm.

217
00:20:15,557 --> 00:20:16,768
I'd kill it.

218
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:22,043
You're reading a magazine.

219
00:20:22,044 --> 00:20:24,174
You come across a full-page
nude photo of a girl.

220
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:27,911
Is this testing whether I'm a Replicant
or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?

221
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:29,414
Just answer the questions, please.

222
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:36,361
You show it to your husband.

223
00:20:36,428 --> 00:20:39,056
He likes it so much
he hangs it on your bedroom wall.

224
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:40,657
Bush outside your window?

225
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:42,034
I wouldn't let him.

226
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,869
Orange body, green legs?

227
00:20:44,036 --> 00:20:45,329
Why not?

228
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:47,064
I should be enough for him.

229
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:53,378
One more question.

230
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:57,015
You're watching a stage play,
a banquet is in progress.

231
00:20:57,382 --> 00:21:00,611
The guests are enjoying
an appetizer of raw oysters.

232
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:04,106
The entrée consists of boiled dog.

233
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:23,351
Would you step out
for a few moments, Rachael?

234
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:34,653
Thank you.

235
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:38,682
She's a Replicant, isn't she?

236
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:40,401
I'm impressed.

237
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:43,537
How many questions
does it usually take to spot one?

238
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:45,262
I don't get it, Tyrell.

239
00:21:45,363 --> 00:21:46,656
How many questions?

240
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:48,593
Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.

241
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:52,104
It took more than a hundred for Rachael,
didn't it?

242
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,306
She doesn't know.

243
00:21:54,272 --> 00:21:56,066
She's beginning to suspect, I think.

244
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:58,318
Suspect?
How can it not know what it is?

245
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,855
Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell.

246
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:03,874
More human than human is our motto.

247
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:06,911
Rachael is an experiment, nothing more.

248
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:10,698
We began to recognize in them...

249
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:15,464
a strange obsession, after all they are
emotionally inexperienced with only

250
00:22:15,565 --> 00:22:19,556
a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted.

251
00:22:19,923 --> 00:22:22,480
If we gift them with a past,

252
00:22:23,481 --> 00:22:27,732
we create a cushion or a pillow for their emotions
then consequently we can control them better.

253
00:22:28,398 --> 00:22:29,534
Memories.

254
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,419
You're talking about memories.

255
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:45,323
<i>Reaction time is a factor in this,
so please pay attention.</i>

256
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,451
<i>Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Sure.</i>

257
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:50,287
<i>1187 at Huntervvasser.
Yeah. That's the hotel.</i>

258
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:51,621
<i>What?
Where I live.</i>

259
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:53,457
<i>Nice place?
Yeah, sure, I guess.</i>

260
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:55,459
<i>Is that part of the test?
No.</i>

261
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:27,416
Kowalski.

262
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:16,442
Time...

263
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:18,860
enough.

264
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,481
Did you get your precious photos?

265
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:44,386
Someone was there.

266
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:46,764
Men?

267
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:53,596
Policemen?

268
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:29,741
Fiery the angels fell.

269
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:33,203
Deep thunder rolled around their shores.

270
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:36,415
Burning with the fires of Orc.

271
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:41,345
You not come here!

272
00:27:41,646 --> 00:27:42,713
Illegal!

273
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:47,617
Hey! Hey!

274
00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:51,964
Cold! Those are my eyes! Freezing!

275
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:04,168
Yes.

276
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:06,236
Questions.

277
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,612
Hey! Hey!

278
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:33,013
Morphology. Longevity. lncept dates.

279
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,781
Don't know.

280
00:28:35,048 --> 00:28:36,742
I don't know such stuff.

281
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,679
I just do eyes.

282
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:43,982
Just eyes, just genetic design.

283
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:45,684
Just eyes.

284
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:49,513
You Nexus?

285
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,566
I design your eyes.

286
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:54,335
Chew...

287
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:59,490
if only you could see
what I've seen with your eyes.

288
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:01,675
Now...

289
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:03,977
questions.

290
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:06,430
I don't know answers.

291
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:08,132
Who does?

292
00:29:12,335 --> 00:29:13,411
Tyrel.

293
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:15,296
He. He knows everything.

294
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:18,709
Tyrell Corporation?

295
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:21,586
He big boss. Big genius.

296
00:29:21,587 --> 00:29:23,521
He. He design your mind.

297
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:25,007
Your brain.

298
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:27,985
Smart.

299
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,805
Very cold.

300
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:37,761
Not an easy man to see...

301
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:40,614
Give me coat.

302
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:44,017
I guess.

303
00:29:50,656 --> 00:29:51,674
Sebastian.

304
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:53,951
He. He take. He take you there.

305
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:55,520
He take you there.

306
00:29:55,587 --> 00:29:57,331
Sebastian who?

307
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,628
J. JF.

308
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:04,856
Sebast...

309
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:09,176
Now...

310
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:13,481
where...

311
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:16,634
would we find this...

312
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:19,662
J.F. Sebastian?

313
00:30:21,946 --> 00:30:23,357
<i>Let's continue, shall we?</i>

314
00:30:24,365 --> 00:30:26,409
<i>Describe in single words,</i>

315
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,542
<i>only the good things that
come into your mind,</i>

316
00:30:29,143 --> 00:30:30,246
<i>about your mother.</i>

317
00:30:30,513 --> 00:30:31,882
<i>My mother?
Yeah.</i>

318
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:34,334
<i>I'll tell you about my mother.</i>

319
00:30:56,397 --> 00:30:58,312
<i>Voice-print identification.</i>

320
00:30:58,413 --> 00:30:59,584
<i>Your floor number, please.</i>

321
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:00,730
Deckard, 97.

322
00:31:00,731 --> 00:31:02,596
<i>97. Thank you. Danke.</i>

323
00:31:24,717 --> 00:31:26,070
I wanted to see you.

324
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,660
So I waited.

325
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:35,429
Let me help you.

326
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:40,768
What do I need help for?

327
00:31:43,444 --> 00:31:45,138
I don't know why he told you
what he did.

328
00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:46,990
Talk to him.

329
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:49,026
He wouldn't see me.

330
00:32:02,088 --> 00:32:03,307
You want a drink?

331
00:32:06,676 --> 00:32:07,694
No!

332
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:16,153
You think I'm a Replicant, don't you?

333
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:23,593
Look.

334
00:32:24,986 --> 00:32:26,497
It's me with my mother.

335
00:32:28,698 --> 00:32:29,698
Yeah!

336
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:38,125
Remember when you were six?

337
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:42,962
You and your brother snuck into an empty
building through a basement window.

338
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:44,606
You were gonna play doctor?

339
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:47,579
He showed you his,

340
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,135
and when it got to be your turn,
you chickened and ran.

341
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:51,504
Remember that?

342
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:55,526
Did you ever tell anybody that?

343
00:32:55,727 --> 00:32:57,295
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody?

344
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:03,816
You remember the spider that lived
in the bush outside your window?

345
00:33:04,567 --> 00:33:06,144
Orange body, green legs?

346
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:09,406
Watched her build a web all summer?

347
00:33:10,073 --> 00:33:12,150
Then one day, there's a big egg in it.

348
00:33:12,617 --> 00:33:14,327
The egg hatched...

349
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:16,180
The egg hatched...
And?

350
00:33:17,455 --> 00:33:19,516
And a hundred baby spiders came out.

351
00:33:21,626 --> 00:33:22,960
And they ate her.

352
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:28,792
Implants.

353
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:32,170
Those aren't your memories,
they're somebody else's.

354
00:33:32,637 --> 00:33:34,198
They're Tyrell's niece's.

355
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:44,106
Ok.

356
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:46,526
Bad joke.

357
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:48,277
I made a bad joke.

358
00:33:48,344 --> 00:33:49,713
You're not a Replicant.

359
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,322
Go home.

360
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:52,557
Ok?

361
00:33:55,326 --> 00:33:56,516
No really.

362
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:57,854
I'm sorry.

363
00:33:58,955 --> 00:34:00,207
Go home.

364
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,804
Want a drink?

365
00:34:16,723 --> 00:34:18,275
I'll get you a drink.

366
00:34:19,142 --> 00:34:20,677
I'll get a glass.

367
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:06,536
Hey!

368
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:13,818
You forgot your bag.

369
00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:26,389
I'm lost.

370
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:29,926
Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

371
00:38:34,397 --> 00:38:35,606
What's your name?

372
00:38:35,773 --> 00:38:36,607
Pris.

373
00:38:36,608 --> 00:38:38,510
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.

374
00:38:39,276 --> 00:38:40,462
Hi.
Hi.

375
00:38:44,657 --> 00:38:46,742
Oh, where were you going?

376
00:38:48,786 --> 00:38:49,971
Home?

377
00:38:51,664 --> 00:38:53,082
I don't have one.

378
00:38:57,003 --> 00:38:59,055
We scared each other pretty good,
didn't we?

379
00:38:59,422 --> 00:39:00,673
We sure did.

380
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:08,373
I'm hungry, J.F.

381
00:39:09,432 --> 00:39:11,109
I got stuff inside.

382
00:39:12,268 --> 00:39:13,586
You wanna come in?

383
00:39:13,894 --> 00:39:15,588
I was hoping you'd say that.

384
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:52,416
Do you live in this building
all by yourself?

385
00:39:52,683 --> 00:39:54,953
Yeah, I live here
pretty much alone right now.

386
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:58,523
No housing shortage around here.

387
00:40:01,067 --> 00:40:02,752
Plenty of room for everybody.

388
00:40:12,661 --> 00:40:14,497
Watch out for the water.

389
00:40:16,874 --> 00:40:18,835
Must get lonely here, J.F.

390
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:23,948
Not really. I make friends.

391
00:40:24,715 --> 00:40:27,594
They're toys. My friends are toys.
I make them.

392
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,596
It's a hobby.
I'm a genetic designer.

393
00:40:30,763 --> 00:40:32,281
Do you know what that is?

394
00:40:32,848 --> 00:40:33,848
No.

395
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,353
Now.

396
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:44,761
Home again.

397
00:40:50,366 --> 00:40:52,719
Home again jiggidy-jig.

398
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:55,972
Good evening, J.F.
Evening fellas.

399
00:41:08,134 --> 00:41:09,370
They're my friends.

400
00:41:09,571 --> 00:41:10,553
I made them.

401
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,155
Where are your folks?

402
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:14,223
I'm sort of an orphan.

403
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:16,600
What about your friends?

404
00:41:16,767 --> 00:41:19,128
I have some, but I have to find them.

405
00:41:19,395 --> 00:41:21,122
I'll let them know where I am tomorrow.

406
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:27,540
Can I take those things for you?

407
00:41:28,841 --> 00:41:30,239
They're soaked, aren't they?

408
00:43:09,255 --> 00:43:11,924
Enhance 224 to 176.

409
00:43:29,483 --> 00:43:30,843
Enhance.

410
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,111
Stop.

411
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:47,368
Move in.

412
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:49,335
Stop.

413
00:43:50,629 --> 00:43:51,964
Pull out, track right.

414
00:43:52,631 --> 00:43:53,631
Stop.

415
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:57,453
Center and pull back.

416
00:44:00,222 --> 00:44:01,222
Stop.

417
00:44:03,142 --> 00:44:04,977
Track 45 right.

418
00:44:06,979 --> 00:44:07,979
Stop.

419
00:44:08,314 --> 00:44:09,665
Center and stop.

420
00:44:15,988 --> 00:44:18,333
Enhance 34 to 36.

421
00:44:28,709 --> 00:44:30,453
Pan right and pull back.

422
00:44:32,087 --> 00:44:33,172
Stop.

423
00:44:39,178 --> 00:44:40,846
Enhance 34 to 46.

424
00:44:52,858 --> 00:44:53,960
Pull back.

425
00:44:55,235 --> 00:44:56,209
Wait a minute.

426
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:56,904
Go right.

427
00:44:58,364 --> 00:44:59,364
Stop.

428
00:45:00,407 --> 00:45:02,067
Enhance 57-19.

429
00:45:04,286 --> 00:45:05,947
Track 45 left.

430
00:45:08,415 --> 00:45:09,450
Stop.

431
00:45:11,919 --> 00:45:14,013
Enhance 15 to 23.

432
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:27,335
Give me a hard copy right there.

433
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:25,785
Fish?

434
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:44,936
I think it was manufactured locally.

435
00:46:49,224 --> 00:46:51,118
Finest quality.

436
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,196
Superior workmanship.

437
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:57,149
There is the maker's serial number.

438
00:46:57,316 --> 00:47:00,018
99069

439
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:01,920
47

440
00:47:02,421 --> 00:47:04,022
XB71

441
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:05,824
Interesting.

442
00:47:06,909 --> 00:47:08,513
Not fish.

443
00:47:08,814 --> 00:47:10,329
Snake scale.

444
00:47:10,996 --> 00:47:12,114
Snake.

445
00:47:12,623 --> 00:47:14,538
Try Abdul Ben Hassan.

446
00:47:14,939 --> 00:47:16,653
He make this snake!

447
00:48:18,981 --> 00:48:20,491
Abdul Hassan.

448
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:24,753
I'm a police officer.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

449
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,365
Artificial-snake license XB71,
that's you?

450
00:48:29,366 --> 00:48:30,553
This is your work?

451
00:48:30,754 --> 00:48:32,302
Who did you sell it to?

452
00:48:32,569 --> 00:48:33,447
My work?

453
00:48:33,648 --> 00:48:35,246
Not too many could
afford such quality.

454
00:48:35,247 --> 00:48:36,373
How many?

455
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,350
Very few.
How few?

456
00:48:38,959 --> 00:48:40,586
Look, my friend...
Taffey Lewis.

457
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:43,098
Down in Fourth Sector, Chinatown.

458
00:49:20,751 --> 00:49:22,586
Bartender.

459
00:49:26,214 --> 00:49:28,091
Taffey Lewis?
Thank you.

460
00:49:33,388 --> 00:49:34,765
Taffey.
Yeah?

461
00:49:35,891 --> 00:49:38,009
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

462
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:39,903
Blow.

463
00:49:41,772 --> 00:49:44,166
You ever buy snakes
from the Egyptian, Taffey?

464
00:49:44,232 --> 00:49:45,834
All the time, pal.

465
00:49:48,570 --> 00:49:49,805
You ever see this girl?

466
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:52,866
Never seen her. Buzz off.

467
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:54,910
Your licenses in order, pal?

468
00:49:55,661 --> 00:49:56,862
Hey, Louie.

469
00:49:57,329 --> 00:49:58,603
The man is dry.

470
00:49:59,004 --> 00:50:00,788
Give him one on the house, ok.

471
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:02,116
See?

472
00:50:44,292 --> 00:50:45,461
<i>Hello?</i>

473
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:51,066
I've had people walk out on me before,
but not when...

474
00:50:51,633 --> 00:50:53,702
I was being so charming.

475
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:57,498
I'm in a bar here now,
down in the Fourth Sector.

476
00:50:59,182 --> 00:51:00,808
Taffey Lewis is on the line.

477
00:51:00,809 --> 00:51:02,979
Why don't you come on down here
and have a drink?

478
00:51:04,146 --> 00:51:05,890
<i>I don't think so, Mr. Deckard.</i>

479
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:09,234
<i>That's not my kind of place.</i>

480
00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:10,986
Go someplace else?

481
00:51:26,877 --> 00:51:28,921
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

482
00:51:29,629 --> 00:51:31,423
<i>Taffey Lewis presents,</i>

483
00:51:31,724 --> 00:51:34,543
<i>Miss Salome and the snake.</i>

484
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:39,189
<i>Watch her take the pleasure
from the serpent,</i>

485
00:51:39,556 --> 00:51:42,651
<i>that once corrupted man.</i>

486
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,271
Excuse me, Miss Salome,
can I talk to you for a minute?

487
00:52:28,438 --> 00:52:31,467
I'm from the American Federation
of Variety Artists.

488
00:52:32,734 --> 00:52:33,777
Oh, yeah?

489
00:52:33,944 --> 00:52:35,418
I'm not here to make you join.

490
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:37,739
No, ma'am.
That's not my department.

491
00:52:37,906 --> 00:52:39,083
Actually...

492
00:52:41,952 --> 00:52:45,114
I'm from the Confidential Committee
on Moral Abuses.

493
00:52:47,332 --> 00:52:49,067
Committee of Moral Abuses?

494
00:52:49,334 --> 00:52:51,703
Yes ma'am, there's been reports
that the management,

495
00:52:52,011 --> 00:52:54,139
has been taking liberties
with the artists in this place.

496
00:52:54,405 --> 00:52:55,665
I don't know nothing about it.

497
00:52:55,732 --> 00:52:57,935
Have you felt yourself to be
exploited in any way?

498
00:52:58,802 --> 00:53:00,763
How do you mean exploited?

499
00:53:01,429 --> 00:53:03,974
Well, like to get this job.

500
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:06,079
I mean, did you do or...

501
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:08,704
were you asked to do anything that's...

502
00:53:09,271 --> 00:53:10,939
lewd or unsavory or...

503
00:53:11,606 --> 00:53:14,585
otherwise repulsive to your person?

504
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:19,900
Are you for real?

505
00:53:20,101 --> 00:53:21,116
Oh, yeah.

506
00:53:21,283 --> 00:53:24,694
I'd like TO, to check
your dressing room if I may.

507
00:53:24,861 --> 00:53:25,923
For what?
For...

508
00:53:26,324 --> 00:53:27,672
For holes.

509
00:53:27,739 --> 00:53:28,739
Holes?

510
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:31,143
Well, you'd be surprised
what a guy would go through...

511
00:53:31,951 --> 00:53:33,646
to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.

512
00:53:37,757 --> 00:53:38,842
No, I wouldn't.

513
00:53:39,509 --> 00:53:40,636
Little...

514
00:53:41,303 --> 00:53:42,756
dirty holes they...

515
00:53:43,057 --> 00:53:46,008
drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress.

516
00:54:20,175 --> 00:54:23,470
Is this a real snake?
Of course it's not real.

517
00:54:23,637 --> 00:54:26,507
Think I'd be working in a place like this
if I could afford a real snake?

518
00:54:41,863 --> 00:54:44,866
So if somebody does try to exploit me,
who do I go to about it?

519
00:54:45,233 --> 00:54:46,033
Me.

520
00:54:46,077 --> 00:54:47,497
You're a dedicated man.

521
00:54:47,598 --> 00:54:48,404
Dry me.

522
00:55:15,605 --> 00:55:17,399
The only thing they care about.

523
00:55:17,565 --> 00:55:18,775
Hey!

524
00:57:38,289 --> 00:57:40,125
Move! Get out of the way!

525
00:59:26,481 --> 00:59:27,624
Deckard.

526
00:59:28,191 --> 00:59:29,817
B26354.

527
00:59:50,505 --> 00:59:51,615
A minute.

528
00:59:54,509 --> 00:59:55,910
Yeah, what do you want?

529
00:59:56,177 --> 00:59:57,412
Tsingtao.

530
01:00:05,186 --> 01:00:06,463
This enough?

531
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:08,231
Yeah.

532
01:00:17,407 --> 01:00:18,642
Bryant.

533
01:00:39,178 --> 01:00:43,099
Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad
as that skin-job you left on the sidewalk.

534
01:00:43,266 --> 01:00:44,559
I'm going home.

535
01:00:44,726 --> 01:00:46,602
Could learn from this guy, Gaff.

536
01:00:46,969 --> 01:00:49,764
He's a goddamn one-man
slaughterhouse, that's what he is.

537
01:00:50,398 --> 01:00:51,808
Four more to go.

538
01:00:52,275 --> 01:00:53,868
Come on, Gaff, let's go.
Three.

539
01:00:56,321 --> 01:00:57,488
There's three to go.

540
01:00:58,114 --> 01:00:59,408
There's four.

541
01:01:00,575 --> 01:01:03,669
That skin-job you VK'd
at the Tyrell Corporation

542
01:01:03,836 --> 01:01:05,654
Rachael, disappeared, vanished.

543
01:01:05,955 --> 01:01:07,315
Didn't even know she was a Replicant.

544
01:01:07,382 --> 01:01:09,618
Something to do with a brain implant,
says Tyrell.

545
01:01:10,585 --> 01:01:11,860
Come on, Gaff.

546
01:01:12,161 --> 01:01:13,563
Drink some for me pal?

547
01:01:58,900 --> 01:01:59,700
Leon.

548
01:02:00,001 --> 01:02:01,211
How old am I?

549
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,017
I don't know.

550
01:02:09,811 --> 01:02:13,022
My birthday's April 10, 2017.
How long do I live?

551
01:02:13,389 --> 01:02:14,482
Four years.

552
01:02:21,989 --> 01:02:23,282
More than you.

553
01:02:28,287 --> 01:02:30,198
Painful to live in fear, isn't it?

554
01:02:36,546 --> 01:02:39,841
Nothing is worse than having
an itch you can never scratch.

555
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,076
I agree.

556
01:02:53,354 --> 01:02:54,101
Wake up.

557
01:02:54,402 --> 01:02:55,614
Time to die.

558
01:03:30,391 --> 01:03:31,568
Shakes?

559
01:03:33,895 --> 01:03:35,038
Me too.

560
01:03:38,099 --> 01:03:38,899
What?

561
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,760
I get them bad.

562
01:03:46,908 --> 01:03:48,476
It's part of the business.

563
01:03:56,375 --> 01:03:57,752
I'm not in the business.

564
01:04:11,265 --> 01:04:12,776
I am the business.

565
01:05:46,402 --> 01:05:47,695
What if I go north?

566
01:05:51,907 --> 01:05:53,168
Disappear.

567
01:05:58,205 --> 01:05:59,540
Would you come after me?

568
01:06:01,709 --> 01:06:02,877
Hunt me?

569
01:06:08,132 --> 01:06:09,059
No.

570
01:06:12,428 --> 01:06:13,630
No, I wouldn't.

571
01:06:20,227 --> 01:06:21,395
I owe you one.

572
01:06:36,619 --> 01:06:38,113
But somebody would.

573
01:06:51,258 --> 01:06:52,335
Deckard.

574
01:06:55,596 --> 01:06:57,265
You know those files on me?

575
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:00,794
The incept date.

576
01:07:00,995 --> 01:07:02,370
The longevity.

577
01:07:02,937 --> 01:07:04,214
Those things.

578
01:07:06,148 --> 01:07:07,483
You saw them?

579
01:07:11,445 --> 01:07:12,455
They' re...

580
01:07:13,322 --> 01:07:14,432
classified.

581
01:07:14,699 --> 01:07:16,301
But you're a policeman.

582
01:07:17,619 --> 01:07:18,619
Yeah.

583
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:21,022
Didn't look at them.

584
01:07:23,666 --> 01:07:25,960
You know, that Voight-Kampff test of yours...

585
01:07:27,002 --> 01:07:29,064
did you ever take that test yourself?

586
01:07:41,684 --> 01:07:42,710
Deckard.

587
01:10:13,794 --> 01:10:15,204
I dreamt music.

588
01:10:20,676 --> 01:10:22,604
I didn't know if I could play.

589
01:10:24,972 --> 01:10:26,966
I remember lessons.

590
01:10:28,642 --> 01:10:31,863
I don't know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.

591
01:10:37,151 --> 01:10:38,886
You play beautifully.

592
01:11:49,556 --> 01:11:51,359
Now you kiss me.

593
01:11:53,435 --> 01:11:54,995
I can't rely on my...

594
01:11:55,062 --> 01:11:56,931
Say, Kiss me.

595
01:12:00,442 --> 01:12:01,761
Kiss me.

596
01:12:13,789 --> 01:12:15,349
I want you.

597
01:12:18,794 --> 01:12:20,037
I want you.

598
01:12:20,504 --> 01:12:21,689
Again.

599
01:12:22,256 --> 01:12:23,633
I want you.

600
01:12:27,302 --> 01:12:28,963
Put your hands on me.

601
01:13:51,512 --> 01:13:53,602
What you doing?
I'm sorry.

602
01:13:53,803 --> 01:13:54,907
Just peeking.

603
01:13:54,973 --> 01:13:55,975
Oh.

604
01:13:58,727 --> 01:13:59,996
How do I look?

605
01:14:00,397 --> 01:14:01,556
You look better.

606
01:14:02,022 --> 01:14:03,362
Just better?

607
01:14:03,563 --> 01:14:04,567
Well...

608
01:14:05,234 --> 01:14:06,527
you look beautiful.

609
01:14:10,114 --> 01:14:11,182
Thanks.

610
01:14:18,205 --> 01:14:19,624
How old are you?

611
01:14:22,042 --> 01:14:23,486
Twenty-five.

612
01:14:24,153 --> 01:14:25,563
What's your problem?

613
01:14:25,564 --> 01:14:27,014
Methuselah syndrome.

614
01:14:27,381 --> 01:14:28,615
What's that?

615
01:14:28,882 --> 01:14:31,385
My glands, they grow old too fast.

616
01:14:33,053 --> 01:14:34,860
Is that why you're still on Earth?

617
01:14:35,161 --> 01:14:37,167
Yeah. I couldn't pass the medical.

618
01:14:40,269 --> 01:14:41,278
Anyway,

619
01:14:41,645 --> 01:14:43,105
I kind of like it here.

620
01:14:45,774 --> 01:14:47,034
I like you...

621
01:14:47,901 --> 01:14:49,153
just the way you are.

622
01:14:52,406 --> 01:14:53,599
Hi, Roy.

623
01:14:54,366 --> 01:14:55,784
Hi.

624
01:14:55,951 --> 01:14:57,161
Gosh, you...

625
01:14:57,828 --> 01:15:00,022
really got some nice toys here.

626
01:15:00,289 --> 01:15:02,566
This is the friend I was telling you about.

627
01:15:02,833 --> 01:15:05,986
This is my savior, J.F. Sebastian.

628
01:15:06,253 --> 01:15:07,454
Sebastian.

629
01:15:08,422 --> 01:15:10,491
I like a man that stays put.

630
01:15:12,634 --> 01:15:14,771
You live here all by yourself, do you?

631
01:15:16,138 --> 01:15:17,138
Yes.

632
01:15:28,775 --> 01:15:30,411
How about some breakfast?

633
01:15:31,278 --> 01:15:33,280
I was just gonna make some.

634
01:15:33,447 --> 01:15:34,448
Excuse me.

635
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:42,857
Well.

636
01:15:45,709 --> 01:15:46,760
Leon.

637
01:15:47,127 --> 01:15:48,629
What's going on?

638
01:15:53,467 --> 01:15:55,035
There's only two of us now.

639
01:15:57,346 --> 01:15:59,774
Then we're stupid and we'll die.

640
01:16:04,478 --> 01:16:05,988
No, we won't.

641
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:41,181
No.

642
01:16:41,348 --> 01:16:43,092
Knight takes queen, see?

643
01:16:44,059 --> 01:16:45,519
Won't do.

644
01:16:54,361 --> 01:16:56,446
Why are you staring at us, Sebastian?

645
01:16:56,655 --> 01:16:57,831
Because.

646
01:16:58,198 --> 01:16:59,767
You're so different.

647
01:17:01,868 --> 01:17:03,454
You're so perfect.

648
01:17:06,456 --> 01:17:07,456
Yes.

649
01:17:08,875 --> 01:17:10,344
What generation are you?

650
01:17:19,177 --> 01:17:20,387
Nexus 6.

651
01:17:21,446 --> 01:17:22,564
I knew it.

652
01:17:22,931 --> 01:17:26,126
Because I do genetic design work
for the Tyrell Corporation.

653
01:17:26,393 --> 01:17:28,062
There's some of me in you.

654
01:17:29,688 --> 01:17:31,198
Show me something.

655
01:17:31,565 --> 01:17:33,017
Like what?

656
01:17:33,483 --> 01:17:35,002
Like anything.

657
01:17:37,237 --> 01:17:39,425
We're no computers, Sebastian.

658
01:17:39,426 --> 01:17:40,775
We're physical.

659
01:17:43,827 --> 01:17:45,679
I think, Sebastian...

660
01:17:46,246 --> 01:17:47,765
therefore I am.

661
01:17:48,832 --> 01:17:51,327
Very good, Pris.
Now show him why.

662
01:18:19,029 --> 01:18:20,681
We've got a lot in common.

663
01:18:20,947 --> 01:18:22,011
What do you mean?

664
01:18:22,212 --> 01:18:23,400
Similar problems.

665
01:18:23,567 --> 01:18:25,461
Accelerated decrepitude.

666
01:18:28,038 --> 01:18:30,832
I don't know much about
biomechanics, Roy. I wish I did.

667
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:35,162
If we don't find help soon,

668
01:18:35,629 --> 01:18:38,307
Pris hasn't got long to live.

669
01:18:38,673 --> 01:18:40,167
We can't allow that.

670
01:18:42,636 --> 01:18:43,914
Is he good?

671
01:18:44,715 --> 01:18:45,715
Who?

672
01:18:46,014 --> 01:18:47,993
Our opponent.
Oh, Dr. Tyrell?

673
01:18:49,559 --> 01:18:51,603
I've only beaten him once in chess.

674
01:18:52,104 --> 01:18:53,221
He's a genius.

675
01:18:55,315 --> 01:18:56,516
He designed you.

676
01:18:58,777 --> 01:19:00,221
Maybe he could help.

677
01:19:01,488 --> 01:19:03,332
I'd be happy to mention it to him.

678
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:08,863
Better if I talk to him in person.

679
01:19:12,749 --> 01:19:14,470
But I understand he's...

680
01:19:14,971 --> 01:19:16,738
a sort of hard man to get to.

681
01:19:18,004 --> 01:19:19,023
Yes.

682
01:19:20,090 --> 01:19:21,216
Very.

683
01:19:24,678 --> 01:19:26,255
Will you help us?

684
01:19:27,806 --> 01:19:28,999
I can't.

685
01:19:29,307 --> 01:19:30,968
We need you Sebastian.

686
01:19:31,435 --> 01:19:33,354
You're our best and only friend.

687
01:19:47,367 --> 01:19:49,828
We're so happy you found us.

688
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:53,707
I don't think there's another human being

689
01:19:53,708 --> 01:19:55,509
in the whole world who
would've helped us.

690
01:20:45,133 --> 01:20:48,838
66,000 Prosser & Ankovich.

691
01:20:49,930 --> 01:20:50,948
Trade.

692
01:20:51,515 --> 01:20:54,067
Trade at two...
<i>Blue entry.</i>

693
01:20:55,268 --> 01:20:57,947
<i>A Mr. J.F. Sebastian.</i>

694
01:20:58,813 --> 01:21:02,143
<i>16417.</i>

695
01:21:03,693 --> 01:21:05,245
<i>At this hour?</i>

696
01:21:05,612 --> 01:21:08,182
<i>What can I do for you, Sebastian?</i>

697
01:21:11,952 --> 01:21:13,553
Queen to Bishop 6. Check.

698
01:21:19,042 --> 01:21:20,611
Nonsense.

699
01:21:21,419 --> 01:21:23,130
Just a moment.

700
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:30,504
Queen to Bishop 6, ridiculous.

701
01:21:36,935 --> 01:21:38,245
Queen...

702
01:21:40,313 --> 01:21:41,515
Bishop 6.

703
01:21:47,445 --> 01:21:48,623
Knight...

704
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:52,300
<i>takes Queen.</i>

705
01:21:58,999 --> 01:22:00,618
What's on your mind, Sebastian?

706
01:22:01,585 --> 01:22:03,044
What are you thinking about?

707
01:22:04,671 --> 01:22:06,881
Bishop to King 7.

708
01:22:07,048 --> 01:22:08,692
Checkmate.

709
01:22:09,259 --> 01:22:11,344
Bishop to King 7.
Checkmate, I think.

710
01:22:13,179 --> 01:22:15,591
Got a brainstorm, Sebastian?

711
01:22:16,558 --> 01:22:18,919
Milk and cookies kept you awake?

712
01:22:19,686 --> 01:22:21,355
<i>Let's discuss this.</i>

713
01:22:22,022 --> 01:22:23,724
<i>You better come up, Sebastian.</i>

714
01:22:41,625 --> 01:22:43,585
Mr. Tyrell?

715
01:22:45,378 --> 01:22:47,047
I

716
01:22:47,213 --> 01:22:48,532
I brought a friend.

717
01:22:55,388 --> 01:22:58,392
I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.

718
01:23:06,066 --> 01:23:08,935
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.

719
01:23:09,944 --> 01:23:12,206
And what can he do for you?

720
01:23:13,615 --> 01:23:16,318
Can the maker repair what he makes?

721
01:23:17,285 --> 01:23:20,322
Would you like to be modified?

722
01:23:20,789 --> 01:23:22,149
Stay here.

723
01:23:27,921 --> 01:23:30,299
Had in mind something
a little more radical.

724
01:23:31,925 --> 01:23:32,927
What?

725
01:23:34,094 --> 01:23:35,696
What seems to be the problem?

726
01:23:36,930 --> 01:23:38,657
Death.
Death.

727
01:23:40,183 --> 01:23:43,269
Well, I'm afraid that's
a little out of my jurisdiction. You...

728
01:23:43,436 --> 01:23:45,739
I want more life...

729
01:23:46,606 --> 01:23:47,857
father.

730
01:23:52,779 --> 01:23:54,048
The facts of life.

731
01:23:56,324 --> 01:23:58,619
To make an alteration in the...

732
01:23:59,285 --> 01:24:01,705
evolvement of
an organic life system is fatal.

733
01:24:02,071 --> 01:24:05,658
A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.

734
01:24:05,825 --> 01:24:06,826
Why not?

735
01:24:06,893 --> 01:24:10,073
Because by the second day of
incubation any cells that have...

736
01:24:10,774 --> 01:24:13,308
undergone reversion mutations...

737
01:24:13,675 --> 01:24:15,965
give rise to revertant colonies like...

738
01:24:16,166 --> 01:24:17,971
rats leaving a sinking ship.

739
01:24:18,138 --> 01:24:19,889
Then the ship sinks.

740
01:24:20,098 --> 01:24:22,743
What about EMS recombination?

741
01:24:23,810 --> 01:24:25,311
We've already tried it.

742
01:24:25,478 --> 01:24:28,732
Ethyl methane sulfonate is
an alkylating agent and a...

743
01:24:28,933 --> 01:24:30,838
potent mutagen. It created a...

744
01:24:31,939 --> 01:24:33,770
virus so lethal the...

745
01:24:34,237 --> 01:24:36,406
subject was dead before he left the table.

746
01:24:36,614 --> 01:24:39,659
Then a repressor protein
that blocks the operating cells.

747
01:24:39,826 --> 01:24:44,030
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it
does give rise to an error in replication.

748
01:24:44,297 --> 01:24:45,297
So that the...

749
01:24:45,466 --> 01:24:50,713
newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation
and you've got a virus again.

750
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:54,842
But, this all of this is...

751
01:24:56,509 --> 01:24:57,694
academic.

752
01:24:58,261 --> 01:25:00,764
You were made
as well as we could make you.

753
01:25:00,930 --> 01:25:02,482
But not to last.

754
01:25:03,516 --> 01:25:06,686
The light that burns twice as bright
burns half as long.

755
01:25:07,053 --> 01:25:10,365
And you have burned
so very, very brightly, Roy.

756
01:25:11,691 --> 01:25:12,843
Look at you.

757
01:25:13,651 --> 01:25:15,296
You're the prodigal son.

758
01:25:16,362 --> 01:25:18,966
You're quite a prize.

759
01:25:25,538 --> 01:25:26,540
I've done...

760
01:25:27,207 --> 01:25:28,775
questionable things.

761
01:25:29,042 --> 01:25:30,919
Also extraordinary things.

762
01:25:31,544 --> 01:25:33,922
Revel in your time.

763
01:25:37,884 --> 01:25:41,488
Nothing the god of biomechanios
wouldn't let you in heaven for.

764
01:26:34,607 --> 01:26:36,360
Sorry, Sebastian.

765
01:26:37,735 --> 01:26:40,738
Come. Come.

766
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:29,595
<i>Body identified with Tyrell,</i>

767
01:27:29,862 --> 01:27:32,098
<i>is a 25-year-old male Caucasian.</i>

768
01:27:32,265 --> 01:27:35,001
<i>Name: Sebastian, J.F. Sebastian.</i>

769
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:40,006
<i>Address: Bradbury Apartments,
Ninth Sector, NF46751.</i>

770
01:27:40,173 --> 01:27:41,841
<i>I want you to go down there and...</i>

771
01:27:45,845 --> 01:27:48,890
<i>This sector's closed to ground traffic.
What are you doing here?</i>

772
01:27:49,757 --> 01:27:51,111
I'm working.
What are you doing?

773
01:27:51,412 --> 01:27:53,027
<i>Arresting you, that's what I'm doing.</i>

774
01:27:53,094 --> 01:27:54,671
I'm Deckard, Blade Runner.

775
01:27:54,672 --> 01:27:57,507
26354. I'm filed and monitored.

776
01:27:57,815 --> 01:27:59,225
<i>Hold on. Checking.</i>

777
01:28:03,196 --> 01:28:06,108
<i>Ok. Checked and cleared.
Have a better one.</i>

778
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:19,262
<i>Hello.</i>
Hi. ls J.F. there?

779
01:28:19,263 --> 01:28:20,284
<i>Who is it?</i>

780
01:28:20,485 --> 01:28:22,149
This is Eddie, old friend of J.F.'s.

781
01:28:26,928 --> 01:28:28,638
That's no way to treat a friend.

782
01:31:27,233 --> 01:31:29,318
Home again, home again, jiggidy-jig.

783
01:31:30,444 --> 01:31:32,506
Good evening, J.F.

784
01:35:33,062 --> 01:35:36,316
Not very sporting to fire
on an unarmed opponent.

785
01:35:38,401 --> 01:35:41,179
I thought you were
supposed to be good.

786
01:35:43,072 --> 01:35:45,741
Aren't you the good man?

787
01:35:50,579 --> 01:35:53,250
Come on, Deckard.

788
01:35:55,418 --> 01:35:56,694
Show me...

789
01:35:58,129 --> 01:36:00,056
what you're made of.

790
01:36:12,268 --> 01:36:14,145
Proud of yourself little man?

791
01:36:22,069 --> 01:36:23,572
This is for Zhora.

792
01:36:25,448 --> 01:36:26,917
This is for Pris.

793
01:36:33,956 --> 01:36:35,458
Come on, Deckard.

794
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,711
I'm right here,
but you've gotta shoot straight.

795
01:36:40,546 --> 01:36:42,465
Straight doesn't seem to be good enough!

796
01:36:43,132 --> 01:36:44,175
Now it's my turn.

797
01:36:46,093 --> 01:36:49,205
I'm gonna give you a few seconds
before I come.

798
01:36:50,514 --> 01:36:51,514
One.

799
01:36:51,974 --> 01:36:52,974
Two.

800
01:37:06,155 --> 01:37:07,155
Three.

801
01:37:08,157 --> 01:37:09,157
Four.

802
01:37:22,379 --> 01:37:23,379
Pris.

803
01:38:34,618 --> 01:38:38,298
I'm coming.

804
01:38:39,206 --> 01:38:40,258
Deckard!

805
01:38:43,419 --> 01:38:44,066
Four.

806
01:38:44,067 --> 01:38:44,813
Five.

807
01:38:47,923 --> 01:38:50,293
How to stay alive?

808
01:39:13,991 --> 01:39:15,418
I can see you!

809
01:39:41,477 --> 01:39:43,529
Not yet!

810
01:39:43,896 --> 01:39:44,980
Not...

811
01:40:17,721 --> 01:40:19,515
Five.

812
01:40:22,726 --> 01:40:24,269
Five.

813
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:29,508
Yes.

814
01:40:37,533 --> 01:40:39,034
You better get it up.

815
01:40:39,702 --> 01:40:41,203
Or I'm gonna have to kill you.

816
01:40:42,246 --> 01:40:43,520
Unless you're alive,

817
01:40:43,521 --> 01:40:44,906
you can't play.

818
01:40:44,907 --> 01:40:46,167
And if you don't play...

819
01:40:56,260 --> 01:40:57,970
Six, seven

820
01:40:58,679 --> 01:41:00,556
Go to hell or go to heaven.

821
01:41:08,063 --> 01:41:09,732
Good, that's the spirit!

822
01:41:51,106 --> 01:41:52,575
That hurt.

823
01:41:56,528 --> 01:41:58,355
That was irrational of you.

824
01:42:00,616 --> 01:42:01,950
Not to mention,

825
01:42:02,618 --> 01:42:04,353
unsportsmanlike.

826
01:42:08,999 --> 01:42:10,501
Where are you going?

827
01:45:15,477 --> 01:45:18,056
Quite an experience to live in fear,
isn't it?

828
01:45:21,066 --> 01:45:23,252
That's what it is to be a slave.

829
01:46:23,045 --> 01:46:24,296
I've...

830
01:46:24,463 --> 01:46:28,751
seen things you people wouldn't believe.

831
01:46:31,094 --> 01:46:35,566
Attack ships on fire
off the shoulder of Orion.

832
01:46:38,226 --> 01:46:40,162
I watched C-beams...

833
01:46:40,729 --> 01:46:44,399
glitter in the dark near
the Tannhéuser Gate.

834
01:46:48,570 --> 01:46:50,014
All those...

835
01:46:50,781 --> 01:46:53,125
moments will be lost...

836
01:46:53,992 --> 01:46:55,544
in time...

837
01:46:57,788 --> 01:46:58,982
like...

838
01:47:00,248 --> 01:47:01,358
tears...

839
01:47:03,418 --> 01:47:05,029
in rain.

840
01:47:09,257 --> 01:47:11,802
Time to die.

841
01:48:17,742 --> 01:48:20,362
You've done a man's job, sir.

842
01:48:26,334 --> 01:48:27,912
I guess you're through?

843
01:48:30,755 --> 01:48:32,049
Finished.

844
01:48:54,571 --> 01:48:56,874
It's too bad she won't live.

845
01:48:58,575 --> 01:49:00,577
But then again, who does?

846
01:49:34,736 --> 01:49:35,871
Rachael?

847
01:49:44,287 --> 01:49:45,439
Rachael?

848
01:49:59,928 --> 01:50:01,071
Rachael?

849
01:51:08,204 --> 01:51:09,798
Do you love me?

850
01:51:11,166 --> 01:51:12,476
I love you.

851
01:51:13,752 --> 01:51:15,270
Do you trust me?

852
01:51:16,838 --> 01:51:18,140
I trust you.

853
01:51:28,350 --> 01:51:29,393
Rachael?

854
01:52:09,474 --> 01:52:11,894
<i>It's too bad she won't live.</i>

855
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:14,588
<i>But then again, who does?</i>
