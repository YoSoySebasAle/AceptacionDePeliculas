what the Chinese do?"

174
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,600
He says, "What do the Chinese do?"

175
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,810
He says, "The Chinese they screw
a little and they get tired..."

176
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,320
Duffy. Hey, Walsh!

177
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,070
Sophie, go to the little girls' room
for a minute, okay?

178
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,860
- But, Mr. Gittes...
- Sophie...

179
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,530
Yes, Mr. Gittes.

180
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,700
- Jake...
- Duffy, listen to me, man.

181
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,080
I want to tell you a story.

182
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,290
So, there's this guy, Walsh,
you understand?

183
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:05,160
He's tired of screwing his wife.

184
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,830
- Jake, there's a problem...
- Wait a second, Duffy.

185
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,500
You're always in such a hurry.

186
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,250
So his friend says to him,

187
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,510
"Hey, why don't you
do it like the Chinese do?"

188
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,550
So he says,
"Well, how do the Chinese do it?"

189
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,300
The guy says, "Well, the Chinese,
first they screw a little bit,

190
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:20,050
"then they stop and they go
and read a little Confucius.

191
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,020
"Come back, screw a little bit more,
then they stop again,

192
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,980
- "go back and they screw a little..."
- Jake.

193
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,400
Walsh, just listen to me for a second.

194
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,940
I mean, you'll love this.

195
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,190
Now, then they go back
and they screw a little bit more,

196
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,240
and then they go out
and they contemplate the moon

197
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,280
or something like that.
Makes it more exciting.

198
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,280
So, now, the guy goes home and
he starts screwing his own wife, see.

199
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,660
So, he screws her for a little bit,
and then he stops.

200
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,500
He goes out of the room
and reads LIFE magazine.

201
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,670
Then he goes back in,
he starts screwing again,

202
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,250
and he says,
"Excuse me for a minute, honey"

203
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,040
and he goes out
and he smokes a cigarette.

204
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,510
Now, his wife is getting sore as hell.

205
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,550
He comes back in the room,
he starts screwing again,

206
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,630
he gets up to start to leave again
to go look at the moon,

207
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,550
she looks at him and says,
"Hey, what's the matter with you?

208
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,470
"You're screwing just like a Chinaman!"

209
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,390
Jesus!

210
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,230

00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,940

212
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,950
Yes.

213
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,320
Do you know me?

214
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,580
Well,

215
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,450
I think I would have remembered.

216
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,500
Have we ever met?

217
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,420
Well, no.

218
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,840
Never?

219
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,170
Never.

220
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,010
That's what I thought.

221
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,180
You see, I'm Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.

222
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,590
You know, Mr. Mulwray's wife?

223
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,310
Not that Mulwray?

224
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,020
Yes, Mr. Gittes, that Mulwray.

225
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,400
And since you agree with me
that we've never met before,

226
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,780
you must also agree with me
that I never hired you to do anything,

227
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,320

I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes.

00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,620
Well, you're going to get it.

230
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:07,830
Now, wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray.

231
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:10,000
I think there's been some
misunderstanding here.

There's no point
in getting tough with me. I'm just...

- Gittes.
- May I ask what this is regarding?

It's a personal matter.
Has he been gone long?

00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,000
Since lunch.

241
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:55,630
- Gee whiz, and I'm late.
- He was expecting you?

242
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:59,260

- Well, it's this darn drought.

01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,220
I'll look into it,

864
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:17,510
as soon as I've checked out
some orange groves.

865
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:20,010
Orange groves?

866
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:23,350
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.

867
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:30,570
I'm a little lost.
I wonder if you could tell me

868
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:33,400
where the plat books
for the Northwest Valley are?

869
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:35,320
Part of it's in Ventura County.

870
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:38,910
We don't have Ventura County
in our Hall of Records.

871
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:42,580
Well, then, I'll settle
for Los Angeles County.

872
01:06:43,410 --> 01:06:45,120

874
01:07:46,310 --> 01:07:47,770
Say, sonny,

875
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:53,610
why do they have all those names
pasted in the plat books?

876
01:07:53,690 --> 01:07:57,200
Land sales out of escrow
are always recorded within the week.

877
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:00,490
- Then these are all new owners?
- That's right.

878
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:05,120
Well, that means that most of the Valley
sold in the last few months.

879
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,210
If that's what it says.

880
01:08:08,830 --> 01:08:11,500
Can I check one of these volumes out?

881
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:16,510
Sir, this is not a lending library.
It's the Hall of Records.

882
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:19,550
- How about a ruler?
- A ruler?

883
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:23,810
Yeah. The print's real fine.
I left my glasses home.

884
01:08:23,890 --> 01:08:26,520
I'd like to be able to read across.

885
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,030
Why, thank you.

All right, quit it. Quit, now!

889
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:02,510
Search the man. See if he's armed.

890
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,730
I said see if he's armed,
not empty his pockets!

891

Search him. Search him!

892
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,070
He ain't armed.

01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:28,910
the Water Department
or the Real Estate Office?

- Get away from me!
- Answer him!

You come near me

you're gonna need a pair of them!

I'm a private investigator.

I'm not with either one of them.

902
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:52,600
Then what you doing out here, mister?

903
01:11:52,890 --> 01:11:54,930
A client hired me to see...

904
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:58,770
To see if the Water Department
was irrigating your land.

905
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:00,560
Irrigating my land?

906
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:02,270
The Water Department's been sending
you people out here

907
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:05,110
to blow up my water tanks,
they put poison down three of my wells.

908
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:07,320
I call that a funny way to irrigate.

909
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:10,160
Who'd hire you for a thing like that?

910
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:16,660

The one your husband opposed.
They're conning L.A. into building it.

I was at the Hall of Records today.

01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:44,500
In the last three months,
Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres,

and Jasper Lamar Crabb, 25,000 acres.

- Jasper Lamar Crabb?
- You know him?

01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:57,510
- I think I would've remembered.
- Yeah.

They're blowing these farmers
out of their land

930
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:00,980
and then picking it up for peanuts.

931
01:14:01,060 --> 01:14:05,650
You have any idea what this land would
be worth with a steady water supply?

932
01:14:05,730 --> 01:14:08,730
About $30 million more
than they paid for it.

01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:13,900
- Hollis knew about this?
- That's why he was killed.

01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:35,930
Why is that unusual?

942

He passed away two weeks ago,
and one week ago he bought the land.

- There is one question.
- Of course.

Don't be sorry. Neither does Dad.

didn't we, hon?

Would it be possible for me to see a list
of your patients, just to be certain?

01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:17,280
We never reveal the names
of our guests as a matter of policy.

for us to have a look around?

No. Allow me to show you.

- I'd like to see her to the car.

- She knows where it's at.
- I'll stay.

- Nobody's here, that's why.
- I gave everyone the night off.

Easy. It's an innocent question.

1011

No question from you
is innocent, Mr. Gittes.

1012
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:47,300

You saved my neck.

Tell me, Mr. Gittes,

01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,860
does this often happen to you?

1018
01:21:08,450 --> 01:21:09,950
What's that?

1019
01:21:10,820 --> 01:21:13,620
Well, I'm judging only on the basis
of one afternoon and an evening,

1020
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:15,910
but if this is how you go
about your work,

1021
01:21:15,990 --> 01:21:19,790
I'd say you'd be lucky
to get through a whole day.

1022
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:24,250
Actually, this hasn't happened to me
for a long time.

1023
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:26,340
When was the last time?

1024
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,050
Why?

1025
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,970
It's an innocent question.

1026
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:38,970
- In Chinatown.
- What were you doing there?

1027
01:21:41,310 --> 01:21:44,770
- Working for the District Attorney.
- Doing what?

1028
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:46,610
As little as possible.

1029
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:50,190
The District Attorney gives his men
advice like that?

1030
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:52,990
