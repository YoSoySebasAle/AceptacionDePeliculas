1
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,835
Do you find me sadistic?

2
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:38,307
You know, I'll bet I could fry
an egg on your head right now.

3
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,392
If I wanted to.

4
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:45,606
You know, kiddo...

5
00:01:46,357 --> 00:01:52,530
I'd like to believe
you're aware enough, even now,

6
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:58,577
to know that there's nothing
sadistic in my actions.

7
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:04,041
Well, maybe towards
those other jokers.

8
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:08,462
But not you.

9
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:13,050
No, kiddo.

10
00:02:13,134 --> 00:02:14,927
At this moment...

11
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:23,644
this is me at my most
masochistic.

12
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:27,773
Bill, it's your baby.

Sarah, I cannot believe
you are early.

54
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:53,705
What you gonna do now, huh?
What you got?

55
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:56,583
I got your ass!
Remember that? Huh? Remember?

56
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,095
Okay.
Come on, bitch.

57
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:12,349
Come on.
Bring it on.

58
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:52,973
Mommy, I'm home.

59
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,391
Hey, baby.

60
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:56,393
How was school?

61
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:01,106
Mommy, what happened to you
and the TV room?

62
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,233
Oh.

63
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:05,903
That good-for-nothing dog
of yours got his ass

64
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,322
in the living room
and acted a damn fool.

65
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,074
- That's what happened, baby.
- Barney did this?

66
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,452
Baby, now, you can't
come in here.

67
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:17,498
There's broken glass everywhere,
and you could cut yourself.

68
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:26,757
This is an old friend of mommy's
I ain't seen in a long time.

69
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,800
Hi, honey.

70
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:30,636
I'm [bleep]

71
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,471
What's your name?

72
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,684
Her name is Nikki.

73
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:39,353
Nikki.

74
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,981
Such a pretty name
for such a pretty girl.

75
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:46,860
How old are you, Nikki?

76
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:53,659
Nikki, [bleep] asked you
a question.

77
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,619
I'm 4.

78
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,247
4 years old, eh?

79
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:02,626
You know,
I had a little girl once.

80
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:06,755
She'd be about 4 now.

81
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:13,470
Now, baby, me and Mommy's friend
got some grown-up talk

82
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:14,638
to talk about.

83
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,139
You can go in your room now.

84
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:19,226
And I want you to leave us alone
till I tell you to come out.

85
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,144
Okay?

86
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,022
Nikkia!

87
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:26,358
In your room.
Now.

88
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,665
You want some coffee?

89
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,001
Yeah. Sure.

90
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:53,010
<i>This Pasadena homemaker's name</i>

91
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,177
<i>is Jeanne Bell.</i>

92
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,388
<i>Her husband is
Dr. Lawrence Bell.</i>

93
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:59,474
<i>But back when we were
acquainted, four years ago,</i>

94
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,393
<i>her name was Vernita Green.</i>

95
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:04,479
<i>Her code name was Copperhead.</i>

96
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:06,315
<i>Mine, Black Mamba.</i>

97
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:07,983
Do you have a towel?

98
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,694
Yeah.

99
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,032
Thanks.

100
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,367
You still take cream and sugar?

101
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:18,994
Yeah.

102
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:24,082
So I suppose it's a little late
for an apology.

103
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,460
You suppose correctly.

104
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,795
Look, bitch, I need to know

105
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:31,548
if you're gonna start more shit
around my baby girl.

106
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:33,800
You can relax for now.

107
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:38,639
I'm not gonna murder you
in front of your child, okay?

108
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,266
That's being more rational

109
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,644
than Bill led me to believe
you were capable of.

110
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:47,898
It's mercy, compassion
and forgiveness I lack.

111
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,108
Not rationality.

112
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,198
Look.

113
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:59,826
I know I fucked you over.
I fucked you over bad.

114
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,329
I wish to God I hadn't,
but I did.

115
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:05,290
You have every right
to want to get even.

116
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:07,709
No, no, no, no, no.

117
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:09,127
No.

118
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:12,798
To get even, even Stephen,

119
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:19,096
I would have to kill you,
go up to Nikki's room, kill her,

120
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:24,101
then wait for your husband
to come home and kill him.

121
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,603
That'd be even, Vernita.

122
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:28,897
That'd be about square.

123
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,983
Look, if I could go back
in a machine, I would.

124
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:33,610
But I can't.

125
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,989
All I can tell you is that I'm
a different person now.

126
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:42,035
Oh, great.
I don't care.

127
00:11:42,119 --> 00:11:43,704
Be that as it may,

128
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:46,832
I know I don't deserve
your mercy or your forgiveness.

129
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:51,294
However, I beseech you for both
on behalf of my daughter.

130
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:54,881
Bitch, you can stop right there.

131
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,051
Just because I have no wish
to murder you

132
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,803
before the eyes of your daughter

133
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:02,472
does not mean parading her
around in front of me

134
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:05,267
is gonna inspire sympathy.

135
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:08,353
You and I have
unfinished business.

136
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:10,647
And not a goddamn fucking thing
you've done

137
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,232
in the subsequent four years,

138
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:16,528
including getting knocked up,
is gonna change that.

139
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,948
So when do we do this?

140
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,908
It all depends.

141
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:24,828
When do you wanna die?

142
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:27,664
Tomorrow?
The day after tomorrow?

143
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:29,249
How about tonight, bitch?

144
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,543
Splendid.
Where?

145
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,379
There's a baseball diamond
where I coach little league

146
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:35,756
about a mile from here.

147
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,175
We meet there around 2:30
in the morning,

148
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:42,262
dressed all in black,
your hair in a black stocking.

149
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,848
And we have us a knife fight.

150
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,892
We won't be bothered.

151
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:52,105
Now, I have to fix
Nikki's cereal.

152
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:03,116
Bill said you were one
of the best ladies he saw

153
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,534
with an edged weapon.

154
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,953
Fuck you, bitch.

155
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:09,331
I know he didn't qualify
that shit.

156
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:13,710
So you can just kiss my
motherfucking ass, Black Mamba.

157
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,629
Black Mamba.

158
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,590
I should have been
motherfucking Black Mamba.

159
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:19,841
Weapon of choice?

160
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:22,677
If you wanna stick with your
butcher knife, that's fine.

161
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,890
Very funny, bitch.

162
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,725
Very funny!

163
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:30,161
It was not my intention
to do this in front of you.

164
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,374
For that, I'm sorry.

165
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,294
But you can take my word for it.

166
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,757
Your mother had it coming.

167
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:04,571
When you grow up, if you still
feel raw about it...

168
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,826
I'll be waiting.

169
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,249
For those regarded as warriors...

170
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,668
When engaged in combat...

171
00:15:18,752 --> 00:15:24,382
the vanquishing of thine enemy can be
the warrior's only concern.

172
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:32,015
Suppress all human emotion and compassion...

173
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:43,360
...kill whoever stands in thy way, even if that be
Lord God, or Buddha himself.

174
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:55,538
This truth lies at the heart of the art of combat.

175
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,232
Come on out to Dallas.

176
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:26,486
This is Rockabilly Rhythms

177
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,697

186
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:12,073
Well, give me the gory details,
Son Number One.

187
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:14,743
It's a goddamn massacre, Pop.

188
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,539
They wiped out the whole
wedding party, execution style.

189
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,460
Give me a figure.

190
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,336
Nine dead bodies.

191
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,964
And we're talking
the whole shebang.

192
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:30,884
Bride. Groom.

193
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:32,677
Reverend.

194
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:35,221
Reverend's wife.

195
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:39,267
They even shot that old colored
fella that plays the organ.

196
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:41,811
It would appear
somebody objected to this

197
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:44,773
and wasn't able to hold
their peace.

198
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:52,906
Good gravy, Marie.

199
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:59,871
What'd I tell you, Pop?

200
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:03,124
It's like a goddamn
Nicaraguan death squad.

201
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:06,002
You better shit-can
that blasphemy, boy.

202
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:07,670
You're in a house of worship.

203
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,339
Sorry, Pop.

204
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:13,927
Well, this is definitely
the work of professionals.

205
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:18,014
I'd guesstimate
Mexican Mafia hit squad.

206
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:21,434
Four, maybe five strong.

207
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:23,561
How can you tell?

208
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:26,314
Well, a sure and steady hand
did this.

209
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:30,443
This ain't no
squirrelly amateur.

210
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,655
This is the work of a salty dog.

211
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,616
You can tell by the cleanliness
of the carnage.

212
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:40,328
Now, a kill-crazy rampage,
though it may be,

213
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:43,706
all the colors are kept
inside the lines.

214
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:48,294
If you was a moron,
you could almost admire it.

215
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:01,432
Who's the bride?

216
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:02,976
Don't know.

217
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,978
The name
on the marriage certificate

218
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,939
is Arlene Machiavelli.

219
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,315
That's a fake.

220
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,484
We've been calling her
"The Bride"

221
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,069
on account of the dress.

222
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:16,156
You can tell she was pregnant.

223
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:17,949
Man would have to be a mad dog

224
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:21,744
to shoot a goddamn good-looking
gal like that in the head.

225
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,707
Look at her.

226
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:32,547
Hay-colored hair.
Big eyes.

227
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,383
She's a little
blood-spattered angel.

228
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,847
Son Number One?

229
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,098
Yeah?

230
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:46,728
This tall drink of cocksucker
ain't dead.

231
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:24,052
I might never have liked you.

232
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:28,765
Point in fact, I despise you.

233
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:34,103
But that shouldn't suggest
that I don't respect you.

234
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:40,526
Dying in our sleep is a luxury

235
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,613
that our kind
is rarely afforded.

236
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:47,033
My gift to you.

237
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,541
For fuck's sake.

238
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:00,463
Hello, Bill.

239
00:23:02,131 --> 00:23:04,133
What's her condition?

240
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:06,386
Comatose.

241
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:08,679
Where is she?

242
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:12,016
I'm standing over her right now.

243
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,185
That's my girl.

244
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,524
Elle, you're going to abort
the mission.

245
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:20,817
What?

246
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,485
We owe her better than that.

247
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,320
Oh, you don't owe her shit!

248
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:26,030
Will you keep your voice down?

249
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:27,990
You don't owe her shit!

250
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:30,159
May I say one thing?

251
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:32,078
Speak.

252
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:35,164
Y'all beat the hell
out of that woman.

253
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:37,125
But you didn't kill her.

254
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,168
And I put a bullet in her head.

255
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:42,422
But her heart
just kept on beating.

256
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:44,090
Now, you saw that yourself

257
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:48,970
with your own beautiful
blue eye, did you not?

258
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:53,349
We've done a lot of things
to this lady.

259
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:58,938
And if she ever wakes up,
we'll do a whole lot more.

260
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,940
But one thing we won't do

261
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:05,403
is sneak into her room
in the night like a filthy rat

262
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:08,364
and kill her in her sleep.

263
00:24:09,449 --> 00:24:12,118
And the reason
we won't do that thing

264
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:17,123
is because that thing
would lower us.

265
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:19,584
Don't you agree, Miss Driver?

266
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:22,795
I guess.

267
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:25,381
Do you really have to guess?

268
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,550
No.

269
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:31,387
I don't really have to guess.
I know.

270
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,016
Come on home, honey.

271
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:38,394
Affirmative.

272
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:41,772
I love you very much.

273
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:43,900
I love you, too.

274
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:48,571
Bye-bye.

275
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:02,168
Thought that was pretty
fucking funny, didn't you?

276
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,961
Hmm?

277
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:08,341
Word of advice, shithead.

278
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:11,469
Don't you ever wake up.

279
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:52,969
At this moment, this is me
at my most masochistic.

280
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:56,222
Bill, it's your baby.

281
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:01,871
Oh, my baby.

282
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:29,565
Four years.

283
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:31,233
Four years.

284
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:03,265
The price is $75 a fuck,
my friend.

285
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,267
You getting your freak on
or what?

286
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:07,186
Oh, yeah, boy.

287
00:28:11,565 --> 00:28:13,526
20, 40, 60, 75.

288
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,569
Yeah.
Now here's the rules.

289
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:17,363
Rule number one.

290
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:18,531
No punching her.

291
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,408
Nurse comes in
and she got a shiner

292
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:22,034
or less some teeth, jig's up.

293
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:24,495
So no knuckle sandwiches
under no circumstances.

294
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,580
And by the way,
this cunt's a spitter.

295
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:30,042
It's a motor-reflex thing.
But spit or no, no punching.

296
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:33,129
- Now, are clear on rule one?
- Yeah.

297
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:36,340
Good. Now, rule number two.
No monkey bites, no hickeys.

298
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:39,051
In fact, no leaving no marks
of no kind.

299
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:42,263
After that,
it's all good, buddy.

300
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,432
Now, her plumbing down there
don't work.

301
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:46,115
So feel free to come in her
all you want.

302
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:48,060
Keep the noise down.
Try not to make a mess.

303
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:49,895
I'll be back in 20.

304
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:52,481
Yeah.

305
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:54,316
Oh, shit.

306
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,902
By the way, not all the time,
but sometimes

307
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:59,572
this chick's cooch can get
drier than a bucket of sand.

308
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:03,075
If she dry, lube up with this
and you'll be good to go.

309
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:06,036
<i>Bon appetit</i>, good buddy.

310
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:18,132
Oh, yeah.

311
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,218
Oh, God damn.

312
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:23,929
You are the best-looking girl
I've had today.

313
00:29:45,618 --> 00:29:46,869
Oh.

314
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:15,356
Yo, stud!
Time's up, buddy.

315
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,107
Coming in, ready or not.

316
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:19,860
Hey buddy, did you have
yourself a good time?

317
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:22,863
Whoa.

318
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:42,758
Aaaah!

319
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:54,019
Where's Bill?

320
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:56,730
Where's Bill?

321
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,191
Please stop hitting me.

322
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:00,442
Where's Bill?

323
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:03,571
I don't know who Bill is!

324
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:05,155
Bullshit!

325
00:31:12,872 --> 00:31:16,625
Well, ain't you the slice
of cutie pie they said you was?

326
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:19,879
Jane Doe, huh? We don't know
shit about you, do we?

327
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:21,922
I'm from Huntsville, Texas.

328
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:25,801
My name is Buck,
and I'm here to fuck.

329
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:31,891
Your name is Buck.

330
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:33,559
Right?

331
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:36,896
And you came here to fuck.

332
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:38,314
Right?

333
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,441
Wait a minute.
Wait.

334
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,968
"Pussy Wagon."

335
00:32:08,052 --> 00:32:09,929
You fucker.

336
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:40,084
Texas. Okay.

337
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:28,484
Wiggle your big toe.

338
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:35,824
Wiggle your big toe.

339
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:45,626
Wiggle your big toe.

340
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:53,217
Wiggle your big toe.

341
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,932
Wiggle your big toe.

342
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,226
<i>As I lay in the back
of Buck's truck,</i>

343
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:05,020
<i>trying to will my limbs
out of entropy...</i>

344
00:35:05,104 --> 00:35:06,772
Wiggle your big toe.

345
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:10,776
<i>...I could see the faces of
the cunts who did this to me.</i>

346
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:13,737
<i>And the dicks responsible.</i>

347
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:20,202
<i>Members all of the Deadly Viper
Assassination Squad.</i>

348
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:24,289
<i>When fortune smiles
on something</i>

349
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:26,625
<i>as violent and ugly as revenge,</i>

350
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:30,838
<i>it seems proof like no other
that not only does God exist,</i>

351
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,048
<i>you're doing his will.</i>

352
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:35,717
<i>At a time when I knew the least
about my enemies,</i>

353
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:37,886
<i>the first name
on my death list,</i>

354
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:41,723
<i>O-Ren Ishii,
was the easiest to find.</i>

355
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:44,393
<i>But when one
manages the difficult task</i>

356
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,937
<i>of becoming queen
of the Tokyo underworld,</i>

357
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,190
<i>one doesn't keep it a secret,
does one?</i>

358
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:07,332
<i>O-Ren Ishii was born
on an American military base</i>

359
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:09,501
<i>in Tokyo, Japan.</i>

360
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:13,005
<i>The half-Japanese, half-Chinese
American Army brat</i>

361
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:16,425
<i>made her first acquaintance
with death at the age of 9.</i>

362
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,802
<i>It was at that age
she witnessed</i>

363
00:36:18,886 --> 00:36:20,762
<i>the death of her parents
at the hands</i>

364
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:26,518
<i>of Japan's most ruthless
yakuza boss, Boss Matsumoto.</i>

365
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,671
Hyah!

366
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:34,795
Hmm.

367
00:38:43,739 --> 00:38:45,198
Hmm.

368
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:21,860
Oh.

369
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:42,964
Mommy.

370
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:54,828
<i>She swore revenge.</i>

371
00:40:54,911 --> 00:41:00,041
<i>Luckily for her,
Boss Matsumoto was a pedophile.</i>

372
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:06,089
<i>At 11, she got her revenge.</i>

373
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,138
Look at me, Matsumoto...

374
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:18,143
...take a good look at my face.

375
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:22,230
Look at my eyes.

376
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:27,027
Look at my mouth.

377
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:29,488
Do I look familiar?

378
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:34,326
Do I look like somebody...

379
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,578
you murdered?!

380
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:54,322
<i>By 20, she was one of the top
female assassins in the world.</i>

381
00:43:41,745 --> 00:43:44,581
<i>At 25, she did her part
in the killing</i>

382
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:49,127
<i>of nine innocent people,
including my unborn daughter,</i>

383
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:54,090
<i>in a small wedding chapel
in El Paso, Texas.</i>

384
00:43:54,174 --> 00:44:01,806
<i>But on that day four years ago
she made one big mistake.</i>

385
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:04,517
<i>She should have killed 10.</i>

386
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:09,356
<i>However, before satisfaction
would be mine,</i>

387
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:11,650
<i>first things first.</i>

388
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:14,736
Wiggle your big toe.

389
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:23,745
Hard part's over.

390
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:27,916
Now, let's get
these other piggies wiggling.

391
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:04,494
Welcome to Air O.
May I help you?

392
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:06,871
Okinawa.
One-way.

393
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,024
Hi.

394
00:45:35,108 --> 00:45:37,444
Welcome...

395
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:43,450
Welcome.

396
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:46,661
You English?

397
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:49,122
Almost.
American.

398
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:52,876
American.
Welcome, American.

399
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:54,335
<i>Domo.</i>

400
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:57,046
My English very good.

401
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:00,383
You said <i>"domo."</i>
Can you speak Japanese?

402
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:01,551
No, no.

403
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:04,512
Just a few words I learned
since yesterday.

404
00:46:04,596 --> 00:46:07,182
Um, may I sit at the bar?

405
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:09,684
Oh, sure, sure, sure.
Please, sit.

406
00:46:11,853 --> 00:46:13,521
Oh.

407
00:46:13,605 --> 00:46:16,441
What other words did you learn?

408
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:18,485
Oh, just a minute.

409
00:46:18,568 --> 00:46:23,072
We have a customer.
Bring out some tea, quickly.

410
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:26,075
I'm watching my soap operas.

411
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:29,621
Lazy bastard...

412
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:31,623
Screw your soap opera... Hurry up!

413
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:33,082
The tea's hot.

414
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:35,376
Why don't you serve it yourself for once?

415
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,045
Shut up!

416
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:39,881
Get your ass out here!

417
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:42,217
Uh, excuse me.

418
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:47,388
Uh, what other Japanese
do you know?

419
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:48,681
Oh, let's see.

420
00:46:48,765 --> 00:46:50,642
Um, <i>"arigato."</i>

421
00:46:50,725 --> 00:46:53,186
<i>"Arigato."</i>
Good!

422
00:46:53,269 --> 00:46:57,190
Um, I already said <i>"domo,"</i>
right?

423
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:59,818
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

424
00:46:59,901 --> 00:47:01,027
"Konn-itch-iwa."

425
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:02,654
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

426
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:04,656
"Kohn-nee-chee-wah."

427
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:06,157
<i>Konnichi wa.</i>
Please repeat.

428
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:07,659
<i>Konnichi wa.</i>

429
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:08,952
Perfect.

430
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:10,620
Good, good, good.

431
00:47:10,703 --> 00:47:13,540
You say Japanese word
like you Japanese.

432
00:47:13,623 --> 00:47:15,166
Oh, you're making fun of me!

433
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:17,836
No, no, no, no.
Serious business.

434
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:21,047
Pronunciation very good.

435
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:25,718
You say <i>arigato</i>
like we say <i>arigato.</i>

436
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:32,016
Well, thank you.
I mean, <i>arigato.</i>

437
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:33,560
Mm-hmm.

438
00:47:33,643 --> 00:47:36,062
You should learn Japanese.

439
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:38,147
Very easy.

440
00:47:38,231 --> 00:47:40,275
No kidding.
I heard it was kind of hard.

441
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,360
Most difficult.

442
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:45,405
But you have Japanese tongue.

443
00:47:47,866 --> 00:47:49,450
Okay, okay.

444
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:56,040
Oh.
Oh, my God.

445
00:47:56,124 --> 00:48:02,589
Hey, what the hell happened to the tea.
Hurry up... goddammit!

446
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:10,096
Lazy oaf...

447
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:17,228
What d'ya want?

448
00:48:17,312 --> 00:48:18,771
I beg your pardon?

449
00:48:18,855 --> 00:48:22,066
Uh, drink.

450
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:23,359
Oh, yes.

451
00:48:23,443 --> 00:48:25,945
A bottle of warm sake, please.

452
00:48:26,029 --> 00:48:27,822
Warm sake?

453
00:48:27,906 --> 00:48:29,741
Very good!

454
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:31,409
One warm sake!

455
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:34,495
Sake? In the middle of the day?

456
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:39,375
- Day, night, afternoon -
Who gives a damn- Get the sake!

457
00:48:39,459 --> 00:48:42,086
How come I always have to get the sake?

458
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:43,838
You listen well...

459
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:47,091
For thirty years, you make the fish,
I get the sake.

460
00:48:47,175 --> 00:48:49,385
If this were the military,

461
00:48:49,469 --> 00:48:53,014
I'd be General by now.

462
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:55,850
Oh, so you'd be General, huh?

463
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:59,729
If you were General, I'd be Emperor,

464
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:01,980
and you'd still get the sake -

465
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:04,651
and you'd still get the sake -
So shut up and get the sake.

466
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:05,777
Do you understand?

467
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,862
I'm not bald, okay? I shaved my head.

468
00:49:07,946 --> 00:49:09,822
Do you understand me?

469
00:49:13,034 --> 00:49:14,744
Sorry.

470
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:20,041
Oh! Oh, oh.
First time in Japan?

471
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:21,501
- Uh-huh.
- Oh.

472
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:24,796
What brings you to Okinawa?

473
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:26,631
I came to see a man.

474
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:29,300
Oh, yeah.

475
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:32,303
You have a friend
live in Okinawa?

476
00:49:32,387 --> 00:49:33,972
Not quite.

477
00:49:34,055 --> 00:49:35,765
Not friend?

478
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:37,183
I never met him.

479
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:39,060
Never?

480
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:41,312
Who is he?

481
00:49:41,396 --> 00:49:42,730
May I ask?

482
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:46,359
Hattori Hanzo.

483
00:49:58,413 --> 00:50:01,582
What do you want with Hattori Hanzo?

484
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:05,878
I need Japanese steel.

485
00:50:07,672 --> 00:50:11,259
Why do you need Japanese steel?

486
00:50:12,552 --> 00:50:15,680
I have vermin to kill.

487
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:24,439
You must have big rats,
you need Hattori Hanzo's steel.

488
00:50:26,816 --> 00:50:28,693
Huge.

489
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,616
May I?

490
00:51:58,699 --> 00:52:00,451
You may.

491
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:04,831
Wait.

492
00:52:04,914 --> 00:52:07,458
Try the second one down.

493
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:02,346
Funny.

494
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04,891
You like samurai swords.

495
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:10,354
I like baseball.

496
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:21,449
I wanted to show you these.

497
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,451
However...

498
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:27,788
...someone as you, who knows so much, must
surely know...

499
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:34,128
...I no longer make instruments of death.

500
00:53:34,212 --> 00:53:36,005
What I have here...

501
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:42,845
...I keep for their aesthetic and sentimental value.

502
00:53:42,929 --> 00:53:48,559
Yet proud as I am of my life's work...

503
00:53:52,271 --> 00:53:55,942
...I have retired.

504
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:06,035
Then give me one of these.

505
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:08,454
These are not for sale.

506
00:54:09,664 --> 00:54:12,041
I didn't say "sell me."

507
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:14,043
I said "give me."

508
00:54:16,128 --> 00:54:19,382
Why should I help you?

509
00:54:19,507 --> 00:54:24,345
Because my vermin
is a former student of yours.

510
00:54:26,973 --> 00:54:30,351
And considering the student,

511
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:35,564
I'd say you have
a rather large obligation.

512
00:55:31,746 --> 00:55:33,622
You can sleep here.

513
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:37,043
It will take me a month...

514
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,339
...to make the sword.

515
00:55:42,465 --> 00:55:45,217
I suggest you spend it practicing.

516
00:57:13,472 --> 00:57:15,724
I've completed doing...

517
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:21,480
...what I swore an oath to God, 28 years ago,

518
00:57:23,441 --> 00:57:26,735
...to never do again.

519
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:32,992
I have created "something that kills people."

520
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:41,208
And in that purpose, I was a success.

521
00:57:43,836 --> 00:57:46,297
I've done this because philosophically,

522
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:52,928
I am sympathetic to your aim.

523
00:57:55,931 --> 00:58:01,604
I can tell you with no ego, this is my finest sword.

524
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:06,108
If on your journey, you should encounter God...

525
00:58:06,192 --> 00:58:09,361
...God will be cut.

526
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:24,585
Yellow-haired warrior...

527
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:27,254
Go.

528
00:58:27,338 --> 00:58:29,215
<i>Domo.</i>

529
00:58:50,152 --> 00:58:53,822
<i>It was one year after
the massacre in El Paso, Texas</i>

530
00:58:53,906 --> 00:58:55,908
<i>that Bill backed
his Nippon progeny</i>

531
00:58:55,991 --> 00:58:58,244
<i>financially
and philosophically in her</i>

<i>Shakespearian-in-magnitude

00:59:00,788 --> 00:59:02,248
<i>with the other yakuza clans</i>

534
00:59:02,331 --> 00:59:06,377
<i>over who would rule vice
in the city of Tokyo.</i>

535
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,754
<i>When the final sword
was sheathed,</i>

536
00:59:08,837 --> 00:59:11,924
<i>it was O-Ren Ishii
and her powerful posse...</i>

537
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:16,470
<i>...the Crazy 88,
that proved the victor.</i>

538
00:59:18,931 --> 00:59:20,849
<i>The pretty lady
to O-Ren's right,</i>

539
00:59:20,933 --> 00:59:23,477
<i>who's dressed like
she's a villain on "Star Trek,"</i>

540
00:59:23,561 --> 00:59:27,022
<i>is O-Ren's lawyer, best friend,
and second lieutenant.</i>

541
00:59:27,106 --> 00:59:31,777
<i>The half-French,
half-Japanese Sofie Fatale.</i>

542
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:35,197
<i>Another former protegee
of Bill's.</i>

543
00:59:37,658 --> 00:59:39,868
<i>The young girl
in the school-girl uniform</i>

544
00:59:39,952 --> 00:59:45,249
<i>is O-Ren's personal bodyguard,
17-year-old Gogo Yubari.</i>

545
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:48,794
<i>Gogo may be young,
but what she lacks in age,</i>

546
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:51,338
<i>she makes up for in madness.</i>

547
00:59:51,422 --> 00:59:53,465
Do you like Ferraris?

548
00:59:56,927 --> 00:59:59,388
Ferrari... Italian trash.

549
01:00:08,856 --> 01:00:10,524
Do you want to screw me?

550
01:00:12,026 --> 01:00:15,738
Don't laugh! Do you want to screw me, yes or no?

551
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:18,115
Yes.

552
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:23,537
How 'bout now, big boy?

553
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:27,082
Do you still wish to penetrate me...

554
01:00:29,043 --> 01:00:30,918
...or is it I...

555
01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:33,088
...or is it I...
who has penetrated you?

556
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:36,300
<i>See what I mean?</i>

557
01:00:37,718 --> 01:00:42,306
<i>The bald guy in the black suit
and the Kato mask is Johnny Mo,</i>

558
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:46,810
<i>the head general of O-Ren's
personal army, the Crazy 88.</i>

559
01:00:48,562 --> 01:00:50,856
<i>And just in case
you were wondering</i>

560
01:00:50,939 --> 01:00:54,818
<i>how could a half-breed
Japanese-Chinese American</i>

561
01:00:54,902 --> 01:00:59,698
<i>become the boss of all bosses
in Tokyo, Japan,</i>

562
01:00:59,782 --> 01:01:01,575
<i>I'll tell you.</i>

563
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:04,244
<i>The subject of O-Ren's blood
and nationality</i>

564
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:06,997
<i>came up before the council
only once.</i>

565
01:01:07,081 --> 01:01:12,002
<i>The night O-Ren assumed power
over the crime council.</i>

566
01:01:12,086 --> 01:01:14,463
<i>The man who seems bound
and determined</i>

567
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:17,007
<i>to break the mood
is Boss Tanaka.</i>

568
01:01:17,091 --> 01:01:19,927
<i>And what Boss Tanaka
thinks is...</i>

569
01:01:24,348 --> 01:01:25,766
Boss Tanaka!

570
01:01:25,849 --> 01:01:27,685
What's the meaning of this outburst?

571
01:01:27,768 --> 01:01:29,812
This is a time for celebration!

572
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:33,190
And what exactly are we celebrating?

573
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:36,443
The perversion of our illustrious council?

574
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:41,532
Tanaka, have you gone mad?

575
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:42,950
I will not tolerate this!

576
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:45,619
You're disrespecting our sister! Apologize!

577
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:52,292
Tanaka-San, of what perversion do you speak?

578
01:01:57,131 --> 01:01:59,299
My father...

579
01:01:59,383 --> 01:02:00,551
...along with yours,

580
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:03,095
and along with yours,
started this council.

581
01:02:03,178 --> 01:02:04,596
And while...

582
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:06,348
...you laugh like stupid donkeys...

583
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:08,350
...they weep in the afterlife...

584
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:10,477
- Shut up!

585
01:02:10,561 --> 01:02:12,813
...over the perversion committed today!

586
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:16,400
Outrageous!

587
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:18,694
Tanaka, it is you who insults this council!

588
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:20,070
Bastard!

589
01:02:20,863 --> 01:02:22,197
Fuck face!

590
01:02:22,281 --> 01:02:23,907
Gentlemen.

591
01:02:25,826 --> 01:02:31,498
Tanaka obviously has something on his mind.

592
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:37,921
By all means, allow him to express it.

593
01:02:38,005 --> 01:02:43,093
I speak, of the perversion done to this
council,

594
01:02:44,595 --> 01:02:46,680
...which I love...

595
01:02:46,764 --> 01:02:48,599
...more than my own children,

596
01:02:49,391 --> 01:02:54,354
...by making a Chinese Jap-American
half breed bitch its leader!

597
01:03:01,236 --> 01:03:03,989
Aah! Aah!

598
01:03:14,625 --> 01:03:21,215
So that you understand how serious I am...

599
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:23,634
...I'm going to say this in English.

600
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:25,469
Huh!

601
01:03:37,231 --> 01:03:39,650
As your leader...

602
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:41,652
I encourage you from time to time,

603
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:45,739
and always in a respectful
manner, to question my logic.

604
01:03:45,823 --> 01:03:47,074
If you're unconvinced

605
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:49,618
a particular plan of action
I've decided is the wisest,

606
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:50,911
tell me so.

607
01:03:50,994 --> 01:03:52,621
But allow me to convince you.

608
01:03:52,704 --> 01:03:54,748
And I promise you,
right here and now,

609
01:03:54,832 --> 01:03:58,377
no subject will ever be taboo.

610
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:01,755
Except, of course, the subject
that was just under discussion.

611
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:05,634
The price you pay

612
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:09,012
for bringing up either
my Chinese or American heritage

613
01:04:09,096 --> 01:04:12,933
as a negative is,
I collect your fucking head.

614
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:15,394
Just like this fucker here.

615
01:04:17,271 --> 01:04:20,274
Now, if any of you
sons of bitches

616
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:25,195
got anything else to say,
now is the fucking time!

617
01:04:27,281 --> 01:04:28,866
I didn't think so.

618
01:04:31,702 --> 01:04:35,038
Gentlemen, this meeting is adjourned.

619
01:04:35,122 --> 01:04:37,583
One ticket to Tokyo, please.

01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,572

They demand ridiculous things.

Who do you remind me of?

Charlie Brown!

01:13:21,231 --> 01:13:23,650
You're right, he does look like
Charlie Brown.

663
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:25,068
Charlie Brown.

664
01:13:25,151 --> 01:13:26,528
Four pepperoni pizzas.

665
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:28,446
That's not on our menu...

666
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:30,532

TEAR THE BITCH APART!

674
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:19,260
So, O-Ren, any more subordinates
for me to kill?

675
01:17:20,762 --> 01:17:22,639
Hi!

676
01:17:23,723 --> 01:17:25,683
Gogo, right?

677
01:17:26,643 --> 01:17:28,144
Bingo.

678
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:30,188
And you're Black Mamba.

679
01:17:31,898 --> 01:17:35,526
Our reputations precede us.

680
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:38,196
Don't they?

681
01:17:39,781 --> 01:17:45,078
Gogo, I know you feel you must
protect your mistress.

682
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:48,665
But I beg you.

683
01:17:48,748 --> 01:17:50,792
Walk away.

684
01:17:57,131 --> 01:17:59,133
You call that begging?

685
01:18:04,764 --> 01:18:08,101
You can beg better than that.

686
01:20:07,845 --> 01:20:09,055
Aah!

687
01:20:15,019 --> 01:20:16,019
Aah!

688
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:18,980
Aah!

689
01:21:21,794 --> 01:21:23,754
Is that what I think it is?

690
01:21:23,838 --> 01:21:26,549
You didn't think it was
gonna be that easy, did you?

691
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:33,931
You know, for a second there,
yeah, I kind of did.

01:21:34,807 --> 01:21:36,684
Silly rabbit.

693
01:21:37,184 --> 01:21:38,185

01:26:28,184 --> 01:26:29,643
<i>♪ Nobody ♪</i>

716
01:26:29,727 --> 01:26:30,853
<i>♪ Nobody ♪</i>

717
01:26:30,936 --> 01:26:32,521
<i>♪ Nobody ♪</i>

718
01:28:08,158 --> 01:28:12,746
This is what you get
for fucking around with <i>yakuzas!</i>

719
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:14,707
Go home to your mother!

720
01:29:13,349 --> 01:29:16,185
Those of you lucky enough to still
have your lives...

721
01:29:16,268 --> 01:29:19,021
...take them with you!

722
01:29:20,606 --> 01:29:22,107
However...

723
01:29:23,359 --> 01:29:27,446
...leave the limbs you've lost.

724
01:29:28,614 --> 01:29:32,117
They belong to me now.

725
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:39,416
Except you, Sofie!

726
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:43,295
You stay right where you are.

727
01:30:36,765 --> 01:30:39,268
Your instrument
is quite impressive.

728
01:30:43,689 --> 01:30:45,858
Where was it made?

729
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:49,027
Okinawa.

730
01:30:50,571 --> 01:30:53,907
Whom in Okinawa made you this steel?

731
01:30:54,825 --> 01:30:56,994
This is Hattori Hanzo steel.

732
01:30:57,077 --> 01:30:58,495
YOU LIE!

733
01:31:06,795 --> 01:31:08,630
Mm-hmm.

734
01:31:10,799 --> 01:31:13,510
Swords however, never get tired.

735
01:31:14,636 --> 01:31:18,265
I hope you've saved your energy.

736
01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:23,562
If you haven't...

737
01:31:24,897 --> 01:31:27,483
...you might not last five minutes.

738
01:31:29,485 --> 01:31:31,653
But as last looks go,

739
01:31:32,654 --> 01:31:34,656
you could do worse.

740
01:34:13,273 --> 01:34:17,944
Silly Caucasian girl
likes to play with samurai swords.

741
01:34:20,197 --> 01:34:23,075
You may not be able to fight
like a samurai.

742
01:34:26,203 --> 01:34:29,414
But you can at least die
like a samurai.

743
01:34:59,778 --> 01:35:01,488
Attack me...

744
01:35:02,406 --> 01:35:04,116
...with everything you have.

745
01:35:59,004 --> 01:36:01,923
For ridiculing you earlier...

746
01:36:04,384 --> 01:36:06,636
...I apologize.

747
01:36:14,936 --> 01:36:16,688
Accepted.

748
01:36:32,662 --> 01:36:34,164
Ready?

749
01:36:38,376 --> 01:36:40,128
Come on.

750
01:37:13,078 --> 01:37:21,078
That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword.

751
01:39:28,254 --> 01:39:29,923
Sofie.

752
01:39:30,715 --> 01:39:32,467
Sofie.

753
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:34,260
My Sofie.

754
01:39:34,344 --> 01:39:36,680
I'm so sorry.

755
01:39:39,808 --> 01:39:43,186
Please.
Please forgive my betrayal.

756
01:39:43,269 --> 01:39:45,021
No more of that.

757
01:39:45,480 --> 01:39:47,273
But still...

758
01:39:47,357 --> 01:39:49,484
But still nothing.

759
01:39:51,486 --> 01:39:54,864
Except my aching heart
over what she's done

760
01:39:54,948 --> 01:39:57,867
to my beautiful
and brilliant Sofie.

761
01:39:58,910 --> 01:40:01,913
I've kept you alive
for two reasons.

762
01:40:01,997 --> 01:40:04,124
The first reason is information.

763
01:40:04,207 --> 01:40:08,293
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde!

764
01:40:08,294 --> 01:40:10,774
Burn in Hell, you stupid, stupid blonde!
I'll tell you nothing.

765
01:40:11,047 --> 01:40:15,176
But I am gonna ask you
questions.

766
01:40:15,260 --> 01:40:19,305
And every time
you don't give me answers,

767
01:40:19,389 --> 01:40:21,891
I'm gonna cut something off.

768
01:40:22,851 --> 01:40:28,690
And I promise you, they will be
things you will miss!

769
01:40:29,441 --> 01:40:31,568
Give me your other arm!

770
01:40:34,070 --> 01:40:38,199
I want all the information
on the Deadly Vipers.

771
01:40:38,283 --> 01:40:39,701
If you had to guess...

772
01:40:39,784 --> 01:40:41,244
What they've been doing.

773
01:40:41,327 --> 01:40:42,662
why she left you alive...

774
01:40:42,746 --> 01:40:44,456
And where I can find them.

775
01:40:44,539 --> 01:40:47,333
what would be your guess?

776
01:40:48,334 --> 01:40:50,962
Guessing won't be necessary.

777
01:40:51,046 --> 01:40:53,131
She informed me.

778
01:40:55,467 --> 01:40:59,095
She said I could keep
my wicked life for two reasons.

779
01:41:00,221 --> 01:41:01,723
As I said before,

780
01:41:01,806 --> 01:41:05,351
I've allowed you to keep your
wicked life for two reasons.

781
01:41:06,478 --> 01:41:11,775
And the second reason is
so you can tell him, in person,

782
01:41:11,858 --> 01:41:15,653
everything that happened
here tonight.

783
01:41:15,737 --> 01:41:19,074
I want him to witness
the extent of my mercy

784
01:41:19,157 --> 01:41:22,744
by witnessing
your deformed body.

785
01:41:22,827 --> 01:41:26,998
I want you to tell him all the
information you just told me.

786
01:41:27,082 --> 01:41:30,126
I want him to know what I know.

787
01:41:30,210 --> 01:41:34,422
I want him to know
I want him to know.

788
01:41:34,506 --> 01:41:36,925
And I want them all to know

789
01:41:37,008 --> 01:41:43,681
they'll all soon be
as dead as O-Ren.

790
01:42:06,579 --> 01:42:12,168
Revenge is never a straight line.

791
01:42:14,879 --> 01:42:16,673
It's a forest.

792
01:42:17,632 --> 01:42:20,844
And like a forest it's easy to lose your way...

793
01:42:21,803 --> 01:42:25,223
...to get lost... to forget where you came in.

794
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:32,397
That woman deserves her revenge.

795
01:42:37,610 --> 01:42:42,073
And we deserve to die.

796
01:42:45,451 --> 01:42:49,414
She must suffer
to her last breath.

797
01:43:02,177 --> 01:43:05,096
How did you find me?

798
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:06,931
I'm the man.

799
01:43:10,852 --> 01:43:14,272
One more thing, Sofie.

800
01:43:14,355 --> 01:43:19,360
Is she aware her daughter
is still alive?
