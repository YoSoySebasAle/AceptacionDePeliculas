<i>Welcome
to</i> The Kelly File, <i>everyone.</i>

3
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:38,836
<i>I'm Megyn Kelly.</i>

4
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:41,406
<i>Breaking tonight, polls are
moving, the race is changing,</i>

5
00:00:41,408 --> 00:00:43,208
<i>and more than a dozen
Republican candidates</i>

6
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,509
<i>are trying
to make themselves heard</i>

7
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,478
<i>with a little more than
one week left</i>

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,581
<i>till the debate
that could change everything.</i>

9
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:50,982
<i>And we're the gateway.</i>

10
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:52,351
<i>We, the questioners,
are the gateway.</i>

11
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:53,585
<i>We at Fox and CNN</i>

12
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:55,152
<i>and everybody else
who gets a chance</i>

13
00:00:55,154 --> 00:00:56,120
<i>to actually moderate</i>

14
00:00:56,122 --> 00:00:57,456
<i>a presidential debate
with these guys.</i>

15
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:58,423
<i>I mean, these guys,</i>

16
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:00,492
<i>they deserve to face
tough questioning.</i>

17
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:02,327
<i>As Chris says, and I agree,</i>

18
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,894
<i>they want
George Washington's job</i>

19
00:01:03,896 --> 00:01:05,062
<i>and they better earn it.</i>

20
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:06,365
<i>They better show
the American people</i>

21
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:07,466
<i>they're worthy of it.</i>

22
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:09,000
<i>A lot of folks assumed</i>

23
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:11,370
<i>Donald Trump
would flame out by now.</i>

24
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:14,038
<i>They have been proven wrong.
Now wait.</i>

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,139
<i>Here. We gotta get to this</i>

26
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:17,875
<i>because this is just breaking</i>
<i>on</i> The Daily Beast.

27
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:19,010
<i>The headline is,</i>

28
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:23,348
<i>"Ex-wife: Donald Trump made me
feel violated during sex.</i>

29
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,849
<i>Ivana Trump once accused</i>

30
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:27,352
<i>the real-estate tycoon
of quote, 'rape.'"</i>

31
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:29,020
<i>Somebody who speaks
for Donald Trump</i>

32
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,988
<i>has come out
and denied it as well</i>

33
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,157
<i>and added that legally,
he says,</i>

34
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:36,193
<i>"you cannot rape your spouse."</i>

35
00:01:36,195 --> 00:01:38,929
<i>Here's the one thing
you probably know about me.</i>

36
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:40,565
<i>I have a big mouth.</i>

37
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,269
<i>Roger,
you have Megyn on line one.</i>

38
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,371
- Megyn.
<i>- Morning, Roger.</i>

39
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,473
What'd you do
to piss off Trump?

40
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,208
We did a segment
on recent coverage

41
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,909
of his ex-wife's rape claim.

42
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:53,144
You're giving that oxygen

43
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:54,546
before the first
goddamn debate?

44
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:58,250
Roger, we had a full-screen
of Ivana's recantation.

45
00:01:58,252 --> 00:01:59,284
Which is soft.

46
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,253
<i>She accused him
during a divorce.</i>

47
00:02:01,255 --> 00:02:03,921
Well, his lawyer,
Michael Cohen,

48
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:05,290
claims you can't
rape a spouse.

49
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,558
It pissed me off.

50
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,394
<i>Great. The future of Fox News
is now a goddamn feminist.</i>

51
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:10,895
No. I'm not a feminist.

52
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,397
- I'm a lawyer.
- <i>We need him.</i>

53
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:14,201
Clean this up. Now.

54
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,470
<i>Unfortunately,
when it comes to</i>

55
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,171
<i>politicians and the media,</i>

56
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,139
<i>Roger Ailes knows his shit.</i>

57
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:24,075
<i>Appointed head of
the Fox News channel</i>

58
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:25,644
<i>by media mogul Rupert Murdoch,</i>

59
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:29,914
<i>Roger transformed cable news,
pushing Fox to the forefront.</i>

60
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,949
<i>Years before,
to get Nixon elected,</i>

61
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:34,453
<i>he created the modern
town-hall debate.</i>

62
00:02:34,455 --> 00:02:35,986
<i>To get Reagan elected,</i>

63
00:02:35,988 --> 00:02:37,556
<i>he made him address
the elephant in the room.</i>

64
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:41,293
I will not make age
an issue of this campaign.

65
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:43,194
I am not going to exploit

66
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,430
my opponent's youth
and inexperience.

67
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:48,600
<i>To get
George H.W. Bush elected,</i>

68
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:50,268
<i>somebody did
the Willie Horton ads.</i>

69
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:53,505
<i>Roger denies it was him...
a lot.</i>

70
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,241
<i>I have been astounded
at the number of Americans</i>

71
00:02:56,243 --> 00:02:58,276
<i>who are fine with our country</i>

72
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,077
<i>moving
in a socialist direction.</i>

73
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:01,045
Here we go.

74
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:04,249
<i>Their views on capitalism
are quite alarming.</i>

75
00:03:04,251 --> 00:03:06,551
- <i>I'm a...</i>
- News is like a ship.

76
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:08,119
You take your hands
off the wheel

77
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:10,224
and it pulls hard to the left.

78
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,526
Hey, look at this.
James Murdoch.

79
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,027
Tell me those lips
haven't sucked cock.

80
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,904
This is what
nepotism gets you.

81
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:28,172
Roger rules Fox
from behind these doors,

82
00:03:28,174 --> 00:03:29,641
on the second floor.

83
00:03:29,643 --> 00:03:32,277
When employees say,
"the second floor,"

84
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,678
they mean Roger,

85
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,381
or the many VPs
paid to enact his will

86
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,650
without qualms or questions.

87
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:41,520
Now, I know what some of you
are thinking, and no,

88
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:43,555
Roger does not tell us
what to say on air.

89
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,656
He doesn't have to.

90
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:46,458
- Love that dress, Megyn.
- Thank you.

91
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,694
No, really. I love it.

92
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:51,398
He's not horny.
He's just ambitious.

93
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,366
<i>Roger is always watching.</i>

94
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:56,635
<i>The Eagles
postponed their appearance</i>

95
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,637
<i>because co-founder,
Glenn Frey,</i>

96
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,604
<i>is too ill to travel.</i>

97
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,406
<i>In a statement,
the band announced...</i>

98
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,541
Morons.

99
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:04,776
<i>The phone in his office
connects directly</i>

100
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,143
<i>to the control room...</i>

101
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:08,346
...which is down
on the first floor.

102
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,083
- Yes, sir?
<i>- You fucking idiots!</i>

103
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:15,052
That's not Glenn Frey,
it's Don Henley!

104
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,354
- Dump the B-roll.
- Dump it, dump it.

105
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,422
Back to anchor.

106
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,491
That's not Glenn Frey,
that's Don fucking Henley!

107
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:21,626
- Oh, shoot.
- What the fuck, Kayla?

108
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:24,028
I'm sorry.
I don't know secular music.

109
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,196
The <i>Eagles?</i>

110
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,498
Only the biggest band
of the '70s.

111
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,098
When my mom was a toddler.

112
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,434
They all look the same.

113
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,336
- They're just old.
- Oh, my God.

114
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:35,039
Down in the basement
is the Fox newsroom.

115
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,578
All our shows have crews
who work in these pods.

116
00:04:38,712 --> 00:04:39,713
This is my staff.

117
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:42,247
Hey, guys.

118
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,716
We're below the city,
so it smells like mold.

119
00:04:44,718 --> 00:04:46,418
But there hasn't been
a rat sighting

120
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,220
in four months.

121
00:04:48,222 --> 00:04:49,688
Four months.

122
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,591
The anchors and their
key producers have base camps.

123
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:55,059
Here, on 17 and 18.

124
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,630
Often decorated
with viewer art.

125
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:01,233
And everyone in this building,

126
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:04,101
even Roger, answers to eight.

127
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,604
The eighth floor is home

128
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:08,373
to CEO Rupert Murdoch
and his sons.

129
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:11,710
This is the power
behind the power.

130
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:14,346
The actual studios are
scattered around the building.

131
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:17,482
Most anchor
and show offices are here.

132
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,651
Above are Fox Business, radio,

133
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,119
<i>New York Post</i>
and <i>The Wall Street Journal.</i>

134
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,623
Most of the American
conservative establishment.

135
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,791
In one building.

136
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,527
<i>The stage is finally set</i>

137
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:30,662
<i>for tonight's Republican
debate in Cleveland.</i>

138
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:31,763
<i>All the
candidates are looking</i>

139
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:32,664
<i>for a boost tonight,</i>

140
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,866
<i>but only ten of them
have a chance</i>

141
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,167
<i>to appeal to voters
in prime time.</i>

142
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,814
Trump has a real problem
with women.

143
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,083
I wanna ask about it.

144
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:53,085
You can back that up?

145
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,122
Yes.

146
00:05:58,292 --> 00:05:59,457
Good morning.

147
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,661
Morning, Chris.

148
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:13,137
Excuse me.

149
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:31,890
Do you think that's it?

150
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,528
Sorry.

151
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,632
It's probably nerves.

152
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:44,469
No. When I'm nervous,
I hear my heart.

153
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,438
I can't hear it.

154
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,508
That's your first question?
Is this some feminist thing?

155
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,910
She's not a feminist.

156
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,380
It goes to his electability.

157
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:56,381
Did you run it
past Tom Lowell?

158
00:06:56,383 --> 00:06:58,249
We can go after Trump.

159
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,517
The second floor
said that?

160
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,419
No.

161
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,323
The eighth. The Murdochs.

162
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:07,859
Rupert called Roger and said,
about Trump, enough is enough.

163
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:10,895
Look, all Trump does
is watch Fox.

164
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:13,698
Roger gave him air
for his crazy theories

165
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,200
and idiot grievances.

166
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:18,703
Why? 'Cause Roger shares
a lot of them.

167
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,572
Are you sure
you wanna take that on?

168
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:22,240
Yes.

169
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:24,275
<i>It's the new
look of politics...</i>

170
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,710
Okay, I don't know
if these are strong enough,

171
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:27,278
- but they help me.
- Uh-huh. Nausea?

172
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,816
Yeah.
You go live in five hours.

173
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:32,951
- I'll be fine.
- Okay.

174
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,986
Okay.

175
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:37,222
<i>Donald Trump
feeds his own narrative.</i>

176
00:07:37,224 --> 00:07:38,590
Oh, fuck.
So nauseous.

177
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:39,858
If you can try
to keep them down.

178
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,859
Yeah.

179
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:43,294
Fuck.
Stop making that face, Julia.

180
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,729
I'm not making a face.

181
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,431
Five hours?

182
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:47,668
- Yeah.
- Okay.

183
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:54,439
Don't worry.
We're behind you.

184
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:55,542
Way behind you.

185
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,512
There's a blanket
on the chair

186
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:02,414
and, just in case,
a trash can beside it.

187
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:05,617
<i>Welcome to the first
Republican primary debate.</i>

188
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:09,421
<i>Tonight's moderators
will be Bret Baier,</i>

189
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:11,725
<i>Chris Wallace and Megyn Kelly.</i>

190
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:23,468
<i>Mr. Trump, one of the things
people love about you</i>

191
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,469
<i>is you speak your mind</i>

192
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:26,671
<i>and you don't use
a politician's filter.</i>

193
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,441
<i>However, that is not
without its downsides.</i>

194
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:30,942
<i>In particular,
when it comes to women.</i>

195
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:35,814
<i>You've called women you don't
like, "fat pigs," "dogs,"</i>

196
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:37,951
<i>"slobs"
and "disgusting animals."</i>

197
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:39,918
What is she doing?

198
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,620
- <i>Your Twitter account...</i>
- <i>Only Rosie O'Donnell.</i>

199
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:43,888
Great TV.

200
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,890
She knows what she's doing.

201
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,427
<i>Your Twitter account...</i>

202
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:54,332
<i>For the record, it was
well beyond Rosie O'Donnell.</i>

203
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:55,533
<i>Yes, I'm sure it was.</i>

204
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,736
<i>Your Twitter account has
several disparaging comments</i>

205
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:59,404
<i>about women's looks.</i>

206
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:01,406
<i>You once told a contestant</i>
<i>on</i> Celebrity Apprentice

207
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:04,409
<i>it would be a pretty picture
to see her on her knees.</i>

208
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:06,544
<i>Does that sound to you
like the temperament</i>

209
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,580
<i>of a man we should elect
as President?</i>

210
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:09,848
<i>And how will you
answer the charge</i>

211
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,449
- <i>from Hillary Clinton...</i>
- She's calling him out.

212
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:13,918
<i>...who is likely
to be the Democratic nominee,</i>

213
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,021
<i>that you are part of the war
on women?</i>

214
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:20,859
<i>Call me stupid, but I thought
he'd respect the challenge.</i>

215
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:24,028
Trump is pissed.
He was up all night, tweeting.

216
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,997
Crap. Really?

217
00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:27,098
What was he tweeting?

218
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,001
"Fox viewers give low marks
to bimbo @MegynKelly."

219
00:09:30,003 --> 00:09:30,969
Ugh. I hate that word.

220
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:32,904
Yeah. It says you're too sexy
to be smart,

221
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,606
but not smart enough
to be sexy.

222
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:37,442
2:40 a.m. "Wow, @MegynKelly
really bombed tonight.

223
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:39,644
"People are going wild
on Twitter! Funny to watch."

224
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:43,014
- 3:07 a.m. "Dear @Megyn..."
- Go, Trump. Donald Trump.

225
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:44,082
Okay.

226
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,650
How many times did he tweet?

227
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:47,385
Like, 15.

228
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:48,820
Yeah.

229
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:50,423
He's never gonna be President.

230
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,526
Wait. Am I gonna be the story?

231
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:55,529
No.

232
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:58,062
- I'm gonna be the story.
- No.

233
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,731
No. No.

234
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:02,066
<i>I can't let you go without
talking about Donald Trump.</i>

235
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,902
Gretchen's giving
this two blocks?

236
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:05,436
It's that
far down the food chain?

237
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,771
We should get you
a security team.

238
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:07,872
Think it over.

239
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,910
Trump called me
before the debate.

240
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,980
He said he knew that your
first question was harsh.

241
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,749
- How could he know that?
- No idea.

242
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:18,919
I sure didn't.

243
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:26,891
It was good TV. Unexpected.
Goddamn tough.

244
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:28,428
Proud of you, Megyn.

245
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:31,064
Thanks, Roger.

246
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,099
Heard you were sick.

247
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:34,734
Yeah.

248
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:37,602
I think it was my coffee.

249
00:10:37,604 --> 00:10:39,571
- Where'd you get it?
- My driver.

250
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:41,673
He insisted
on some fancy coffee joint.

251
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:42,843
You know this guy?

252
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,476
No. He's a driver, Roger.

253
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,078
- Did you know him?
- No.

254
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,582
You know
better than that.

255
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:52,717
<i>Okay, yes,
Roger Ailes is paranoid.</i>

256
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,752
<i>But his parents were nuts.</i>

257
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:55,753
<i>As he drove off to college,</i>

258
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:58,623
<i>they filed for divorce,
and didn't tell him.</i>

259
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,159
<i>At Christmas, he came home
to find strangers in his house</i>

260
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,160
<i>and all his things,</i>

261
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,163
<i>photos and yearbooks
and trophies thrown out.</i>

262
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,432
<i>I mean, is it any wonder
the man created</i>

263
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,069
<i>a nostalgia machine
for lost America?</i>

264
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:11,471
This is crazy.

265
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:14,539
We're sitting here wondering

266
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,841
if a candidate for President
poisoned my coffee.

267
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,610
It's only crazy
until it happens.

268
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:20,113
And it happens.

269
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,580
I hate being the story.

270
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:23,715
I'll call Trump.

271
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:25,950
You go on vacation.
Stay above it all.

272
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:28,753
He won't dent your ratings.

273
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:32,590
Nobody stops watching
because of a conflict.

274
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,492
They stop watching
when there isn't one.

275
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:35,927
Some viewers will listen
to him.

276
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:38,062
Well, some. But as long
as he keeps saying,

277
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,964
"Megyn Kelly is unwatchable,"

278
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,901
that means he's watching it.
They know that.

279
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:44,771
And they'll watch
what he watches.

280
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:46,606
You'll be okay.

281
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:50,008
See you in a week.

282
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,109
Drink up, buddy boy.

283
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:53,778
Thank you.

284
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,481
Here's to a week
of no kids, but my own.

285
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:57,349
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

286
00:11:57,351 --> 00:11:59,584
Okay,
Frank Bruni in <i>The Times.</i>

287
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,119
- Boo.
- "The debate was riveting.

288
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:02,020
"It was admirable.

289
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:03,721
"It compels me
to write a cluster of words

290
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,023
"I never imagined writing:

291
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:06,724
- "hooray for Fox News."
- Wow.

292
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:07,825
Well, that's gotta
make you happy,

293
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:09,727
praise all tangled up
in an insult.

294
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,062
It does make me happy, Gil.

295
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,830
<i>And, you know,
you could see there was</i>

296
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,065
<i>blood coming out of her eyes,</i>

297
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,867
<i>blood coming out of her...</i>

298
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:16,868
- <i>wherever.</i>
- No. Oh, my God.

299
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,238
Did he just accuse me
of anger-menstruating?

300
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,940
Yes. Are... Um, yeah.

301
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:23,208
- Yeah.
- I'm calling Roger.

302
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,575
No. I'll talk to him.

303
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,910
Take your vacation.
I'll handle this.

304
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,045
- Oh, my God.
- Do you hear the phones?

305
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:28,112
Doug.

306
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:29,013
I have to call you back.

307
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:30,249
<i>Would you like to
correct yourself</i>

308
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:33,551
<i>on that other talking point
about men being dominant?</i>

309
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:35,954
<i>We don't have any time.
I wish we did.</i>

310
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:37,155
<i>We're running over,
we're running over.</i>

311
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:39,724
<i>Yeah, well, HR is on the phone
'cause you called me a skirt.</i>

312
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,125
<i>I gotta read
that manual again.</i>

313
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,628
<i>I'll bring it to your
office right after the show.</i>

314
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,629
<i>Some guy came up
to me and said,</i>

315
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:45,763
<i>"I saw you on</i> Fox & Friends
this morning.

316
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,533
<i>"Is Gretchen as cute in person
as she is on TV?"</i>

317
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,134
- <i>Oh, come on.</i>
- <i>And what did you answer him?</i>

318
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:51,203
<i>Beautiful dress.</i>

319
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:52,770
<i>You look wonderful.
Great color.</i>

320
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:54,138
<i>In summary,
Gretchen's beautiful.</i>

321
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,573
<i>Beautiful. You look beautiful.</i>

322
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,542
<i>Well, you look fabulous, too.</i>

323
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:59,677
<i>'Cause you gotta wax?
Does the waxing hurt?</i>

324
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,546
<i>Uh, he looks at me for that!</i>

325
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:03,081
<i>We'll try that.
Women are everywhere.</i>

326
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,816
<i>We're letting 'em play golf
and tennis now.</i>

327
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:05,950
- <i>It's outta control.</i>
- <i>You know what?</i>

328
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,118
<i>You know...</i>
<i>She's out.</i>

329
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,922
<i>You read the headlines,
since men are so great.</i>

330
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:12,991
<i>She needed a shower.</i>

331
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:15,727
The attitude off-camera
was even worse.

332
00:13:15,729 --> 00:13:17,662
Steve simply started
ignoring me.

333
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:20,199
What did Mr. Ailes say
when you complained?

334
00:13:20,201 --> 00:13:22,800
He said, "You act
like it only rains on women.

335
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,871
"Stop getting goddamn offended
by everything.

336
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:28,139
"You're a man-hater."

337
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:31,245
And, um, "Learn to get along
with the boys."

338
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:33,644
Then he took me off the show.

339
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,013
But gave you your own.

340
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:37,216
Well, in the afternoon
dead zone.

341
00:13:37,218 --> 00:13:39,083
I mean, it was a demotion
and we both knew it.

342
00:13:39,085 --> 00:13:43,154
Even though I did increase
the ratings by 15%.

343
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,525
He moved me
to second base.

344
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:47,725
<i>Back in Minnesota,</i>

345
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:50,595
<i>before I graduated

00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:54,132
<i>I played second base</i>

00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:56,169
<i>in the sixth-grade
softball league.</i>

349
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:00,372
I hate second base.

350
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:02,341
Did he ever offer
to reverse that decision

351
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:05,610
if you made yourself
sexually available?

352
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:07,212
Not directly.

353
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:10,081
With Roger,
it's always about loyalty.

354
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,617
He says he can fix things
if you're loyal.

355
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:14,988
And you can guess the ultimate
expression of loyalty.

356
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:17,123
We don't guess.

357
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:20,060
Oral sex.

358
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:21,527
Roger likes to joke,

359
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:24,128
"To get ahead,
you gotta give a little head."

360
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,131
Really.

361
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,232
But Mr. Ailes

362
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:30,235
never unambiguously
asks for oral sex?

363
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:33,137
I mean, it was always
just a joke, a put-down.

364
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:35,307
Like, "You're sexy
but you're too much work."

365
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:36,641
You're... I mean...

366
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:39,844
I have a whole list in here

367
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:42,113
because that's just
how Roger is.

368
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,415
What do you want
out of a lawsuit?

369
00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:47,386
What do I want?
I want this behavior to stop.

370
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:50,188
Someone has to speak up.
Someone has to get mad.

371
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,291
Well, that may not be you.

372
00:14:52,293 --> 00:14:54,226
Your contract
will have a clause

373
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:56,661
requiring secret,
mandatory arbitration.

374
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:58,129
You familiar
with Rudi Bakhtiar's case?

375
00:14:58,131 --> 00:14:59,866
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- Well, you're supposed to be.</i>

376
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:03,270
My first act as
DC bureau chief...

377
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:06,137
I want you down here
full-time.

378
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:08,673
Oh, my God.

379
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,242
That's amazing. Yes.

380
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:11,876
You do know
what this means for you?

381
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:14,112
<i>Shit.
He doesn't think I'm ready.</i>

382
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:16,415
Brian,
I will not let you down.

383
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:17,982
I'm gonna bust my ass for you.

384
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:20,118
Well, Rudi, come on,
that's a given.

385
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,919
<i>So, what's the problem?</i>

386
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,155
But, um...

387
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:28,293
Look, you do get
how I feel about you, right?

388
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:31,197
<i>Oh, fuck.
Fuck, fuck, fuck.</i>

389
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,832
Well, I'm glad
you said that, Brian,

390
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,368
because I really respect
you, too.

391
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,638
No. No. I mean...

392
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:43,275
How I really feel.

393
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:44,878
<i>Just look confused.</i>

394
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:47,845
All I want from you, Rudi,

395
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:50,282
is to see the inside
of your hotel room.

396
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:52,850
<i>God damn it.</i>

397
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:54,288
That's all it's gonna take.

398
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:57,291
<i>Don't react.
Make it your fault.</i>

399
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:00,091
Brian, if I've done anything

400
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:01,993
to make you think
I feel that way about you,

401
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,861
I apologize.

402
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:04,929
<i>Friends.</i>

403
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:06,197
We're friends.

404
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:07,466
<i>Professionals.</i>

405
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:09,035
We have
a great professional vibe.

406
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:11,370
<i>Now sell it.</i>

407
00:16:11,372 --> 00:16:12,237
I just don't do that.

408
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:14,105
I've never had to do that
for a job.

409
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:15,240
I know, I know.

410
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:17,975
You know I'd kill for DC,

411
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,078
but there's no way
I'm showing you my hotel room.

412
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,049
<i>This is gonna
ruin my career.</i>

413
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:28,387
Well, now I feel
like a creep.

414
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:31,490
No.
No, you're so not.

415
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:33,059
<i>Fucking creep.</i>

416
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:40,097
They fired me.

417
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,769
I'm a lousy reporter
apparently. Assholes.

418
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,072
<i>She proved
what they wanted her to prove.</i>

419
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:50,975
No one really wins
by suing Fox News.

420
00:16:50,977 --> 00:16:53,044
It's been our experience

421
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,349
that once you go public
in your job,

422
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,150
no one will hire you.

423
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:01,220
If you're able
to stick it out at Fox,

424
00:17:01,222 --> 00:17:02,321
gather more evidence,

425
00:17:02,323 --> 00:17:07,292
you might be able to sue
Ailes himself instead of Fox.

426
00:17:07,294 --> 00:17:08,460
And that is why I'm here.

427
00:17:08,462 --> 00:17:12,497
Because Marty Hyman told me
that over here in New Jersey,

428
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:16,100
I can avoid arbitration
by suing Roger personally.

429
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:18,303
He says that you've managed
to change the law,

430
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:19,971
and that we could
call other women

431
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:21,440
and show a pattern.

432
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:23,308
Will other women come forward?

433
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,576
Yes, they will.

434
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:26,978
You live and work in New York.

435
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,946
Roger has a house
in Bergen County

436
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:30,815
where he stays
when he can't make it upstate.

437
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:33,285
You do
your homework, Ms. Carlson.

438
00:17:33,287 --> 00:17:35,953
No fingerprints.

439
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:38,223
That's how much I practiced
the violin as a child.

440
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:40,091
If Roger finds out
you came to us,

441
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:42,193
- he won't just fire you.
- Mmm.

442
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:45,430
He will bang us
with a million-dollar lawsuit.

443
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:48,032
He will attack you personally.

444
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:49,967
These men, they care
more about their reputations

445
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:51,135
than they do money.

446
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:52,371
Roger won't stop.

447
00:17:52,373 --> 00:17:53,971
- Oh, I know. Mmm-hmm.
- You know that.

448
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:56,575
Colleagues you admire
will say publicly

449
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:58,610
you're a superior,
ambitious woman

450
00:17:58,612 --> 00:18:00,980
who's suing
because her career stalled.

451
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:03,049
Let 'em.

452
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,653
Okay.

453
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:10,921
If we work hard,
you might be lucky enough

454
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,557
to watch
the most powerful man in TV

455
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,393
go after you
with everything he's got.

456
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,929
Thank you.

457
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:23,337
I'm telling you,
other women will come forward.

458
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,271
Let's hope.

459
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:28,139
Frankly,
I think you have a gap

460
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:30,208
in the network, Mr. Shine.

461
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,545
There are millions of young
conservatives in this country.

462
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:36,448
I mean, you can look at my
Instagram account. There are.

463
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,519
They don't have a voice
on our network.

464
00:18:39,553 --> 00:18:42,621
I see myself as an influencer
in the Jesus space.

465
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:44,055
And don't get me wrong,

466
00:18:44,057 --> 00:18:46,190
I've learned a ton
from Gretchen,

467
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,326
I truly have, of course.

468
00:18:47,328 --> 00:18:49,994
But no judgment here,

469
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,897
my perspective
as an evangelical millennial?

470
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:56,000
It's just not that helpful
to her.

471
00:18:56,002 --> 00:18:59,003
I mean, to be honest,
Mr. Shine,

472
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:01,373
she's sort of Establishment.

473
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,107
With a capital E.

474
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:05,644
That's why I wanted
to talk to you in private.

475
00:19:05,646 --> 00:19:08,549
Kayla, before we
move you up,

476
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:12,517
I want to ask you
something personal.

477
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,554
Mmm.

478
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:16,954
What do you think
of our slogan,

479
00:19:16,956 --> 00:19:18,225
"Fair and Balanced"?

480
00:19:18,726 --> 00:19:20,227
I'm glad you asked.

481
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,127
Look, our news shows

482
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:25,162
and our opinion shows
are very different.

483
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,467
Our news is impartial,
it's top-of-the-line.

484
00:19:28,469 --> 00:19:30,101
Our opinion shows,

485
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:33,170
Roger gave a voice
to people who didn't have one.

486
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,675
And he balanced
the American conversation.

487
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:40,545
So, our newspeople are fair.

488
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:45,151
Our entertainers are a very
necessary form of balance.

489
00:19:48,222 --> 00:19:50,591
Attagirl. Perfect.

490
00:19:52,493 --> 00:19:54,125
But today,
we're sticking up for girls

491
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:56,428
on International Day
of the Girl.

492
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,331
And, for the first time
on cable news, here I am,

493
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:01,666
makeup-free for a reason.

494
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:05,370
<i>Tomorrow I'll be back
in my regular makeup.</i>

495
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:06,671
And I thank
the other brave women

496
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:08,673
who came on today's show
<i>sans</i> makeup.

497
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:13,545
But let's continue to tell
our girls, "Just be yourself."

498
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:14,679
Shep.

499
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:15,714
- And clear.
- Yes.

500
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:17,148
Great show.

501
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,617
Get me some makeup.

502
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:20,385
I have some bad news.

503
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:23,522
Kayla is leaving us
for the asshole.

504
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:24,989
- O'Reilly?
- Mmm-hmm.

505
00:20:24,991 --> 00:20:27,726
It is our
highest-rated program.

506
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:29,361
And we can't be?

507
00:20:29,363 --> 00:20:31,430
No, I believe
in <i>Real Story,</i> I do.

508
00:20:31,432 --> 00:20:34,064
Did you just see that segment?
Did you see it? Did you see...

509
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,066
We're doing
something unique here.

510
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,002
Mmm-hmm.
- Together. All of us.

511
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:40,171
- Can you just...
- Sure.

512
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:41,208
Listen to me.

513
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:45,142
I can get you
where you wanna be.

514
00:20:45,144 --> 00:20:46,511
I can protect you.

515
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:47,746
Just don't get ahead
of yourself.

516
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:50,080
You have a lot to learn.
I can teach you.

517
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,483
I'm not getting ahead
of myself, Gretchen.

518
00:20:51,485 --> 00:20:53,050
- I'm taking the next step.
- No. Listen.

519
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:56,254
- I learn by doing.
- Come on. Come on, please.

520
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:57,389
I'm confused.

521
00:20:57,391 --> 00:20:59,224
You want me to pass on
a promotion

522
00:20:59,226 --> 00:21:03,027
so you can help me
get the same promotion

523
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:04,563
- on a show with worse ratings?
- No. I just...

524
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:06,731
I want a little loyalty.
I need loyalty.

525
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:08,132
Women, together.

526
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:10,735
- I'm loyal to the network.
- All right.

527
00:21:10,737 --> 00:21:12,337
It's not us versus them,
Gretchen.

528
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:13,440
Miss America.

529
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:15,507
Roger.

530
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:17,141
Hi, there.

531
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:19,244
- This is a treat.
- What the fuck are you doing?

532
00:21:19,246 --> 00:21:22,146
A segment on how
we oversexualize women.

533
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,317
I mean, you said
be more myself, so, ta-da.

534
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:26,751
You know
what makeup does?

535
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:28,553
Keeps everybody
from seeing you sweat.

536
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:31,223
Well, it's... Most of
the mean tweets that I receive

537
00:21:31,225 --> 00:21:32,657
are about my appearance,

538
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:34,292
so it is important
that we fight back

539
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:35,360
against this kind of bullying.

540
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:36,795
Bullying isn't meanness.

541
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:38,463
Bullying is
people with more power

542
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:40,097
hitting people with less.

543
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:41,833
These jackasses
have cellphones.

544
00:21:41,835 --> 00:21:43,570
You have a fucking TV show!

545
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,839
We have to fight
the objectification of women.

546
00:21:47,841 --> 00:21:49,139
Oh, bullshit.

547
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,776
Listen,
mouth shut, ears open.

548
00:21:51,778 --> 00:21:53,745
Nobody wants to watch
a middle-aged woman

549
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:55,347
sweat her way
through menopause.

550
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:56,281
What?

551
00:21:56,283 --> 00:21:58,550
Not on
national fucking television!

552
00:21:58,552 --> 00:22:01,085
Thank you for the advice.

553
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:03,089
Objectification.

554
00:22:08,595 --> 00:22:09,694
All right.

555
00:22:09,696 --> 00:22:11,128
Gretchen,
I really appreciate...

556
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,131
Shut up.

557
00:22:14,468 --> 00:22:15,469
Good luck.

558
00:22:23,577 --> 00:22:24,745
Drift.

559
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,179
Go, go, go!

560
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:29,714
Whoo! Good one, honey.

561
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:31,216
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

562
00:22:37,658 --> 00:22:38,723
Hey.

563
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:40,258
It's a zoo here.

564
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,495
The phone's ringing
off the hook.

565
00:22:42,629 --> 00:22:44,296
Anyone care
he called me a bimbo?

566
00:22:44,298 --> 00:22:45,397
Not really.

567
00:22:45,399 --> 00:22:47,632
- He tweeted the <i>GQ</i> photo.
<i>- I saw.</i>

568
00:22:47,634 --> 00:22:49,501
<i>- And?</i>
- Torn.

569
00:22:49,503 --> 00:22:53,170
God, I'd love
to be slut-shamed.

570
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:55,607
Gil wants to ask again
if we should make a statement.

571
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:57,876
No. No response. Zero.

572
00:22:59,446 --> 00:23:01,281
Doug just lost.
I gotta go.

573
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,449
Next time, honey.

574
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:05,617
Nice.

575
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:07,721
- Good game.
- Trump, '16.

576
00:23:09,423 --> 00:23:10,622
Excuse me.

577
00:23:10,624 --> 00:23:12,156
You talk to my wife again,

578
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:13,694
I will beat you
to a fucking pulp.

579
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,698
- That was weird.
- Mmm-hmm.

580
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:21,499
You're getting some action.

581
00:23:21,501 --> 00:23:22,634
Oh, really?

582
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:35,280
Oh, man.

583
00:23:35,282 --> 00:23:36,850
Asshole.

584
00:23:37,951 --> 00:23:39,451
You don't have to worry
about Trump.

585
00:23:39,453 --> 00:23:41,319
You're tougher
than all those guys, okay?

586
00:23:41,321 --> 00:23:42,520
You just gotta worry
about the crazies.

587
00:23:42,522 --> 00:23:43,922
- I can handle a few crazies.
- I know.

588
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:45,056
Mommy.

589
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:47,359
Trump will stop once he feels
he's won the argument.

590
00:23:47,361 --> 00:23:48,860
I feel like
he's less interested

591
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:51,195
in winning the argument

592
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:54,332
than just having the argument
with you in public

593
00:23:54,334 --> 00:23:56,201
to prove he can
take on the establishment.

594
00:23:56,203 --> 00:23:57,869
I'm not the establishment.

595
00:23:57,871 --> 00:24:01,206
Honey, get real.
You are the establishment now.

596
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:02,676
- Mommy!
- Not yet!

597
00:24:04,845 --> 00:24:08,647
You do understand I have
to be above this, right?

598
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:10,382
I have to be an anchor first,
then a woman.

599
00:24:10,384 --> 00:24:11,716
You know the entire country

600
00:24:11,718 --> 00:24:14,419
is talking
about your period right now?

601
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:16,388
- Mommy!
- What?

602
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,256
- There's a man.
- What?

603
00:24:18,258 --> 00:24:19,858
- Yardley!
- Look. He's right there.

604
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,526
- Yardley, where is he?
- Look. There he is.

605
00:24:21,528 --> 00:24:22,761
Oh, Jesus.
He's got a fucking camera!

606
00:24:22,763 --> 00:24:23,828
Come here, honey.

607
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,929
No, no, no!
Don't open the door.

608
00:24:24,931 --> 00:24:26,297
They can't sell them
if we're inside.

609
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:27,666
Get out. Get out of here! Go!

610
00:24:27,668 --> 00:24:28,669
Are you okay?

611
00:24:30,337 --> 00:24:31,605
What were
you guys doing?

612
00:24:34,241 --> 00:24:35,840
- Mommy and Daddy?
- Mmm-hmm.

613
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:38,476
Um...
It was a crossword...

614
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:40,612
Mommy was just taking
a quick little nap.

615
00:24:40,614 --> 00:24:42,449
- Quick one.
- It wasn't that quick.

616
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,884
I'm gonna have to
call Roger about security.

617
00:24:45,886 --> 00:24:47,552
<i>It's as clear as a bell</i>

618
00:24:47,554 --> 00:24:50,288
<i>that Mayhem Kelly has
gone over to the dark side.</i>

619
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,023
<i>The more she sells out,</i>

620
00:24:52,025 --> 00:24:53,925
<i>the wider
her nostrils have become.</i>

621
00:24:53,927 --> 00:24:55,760
<i>Listen to
what I've just said to you.</i>

622
00:24:55,762 --> 00:24:56,661
He's here.

623
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:58,863
<i>This woman was once pretty,</i>

624
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:00,465
<i>and the more she has sold out,</i>

625
00:25:00,467 --> 00:25:01,833
<i>the wider
her nostrils have become.</i>

626
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:03,401
<i>They're almost porcine.</i>

627
00:25:03,403 --> 00:25:05,403
<i>She snorts her insults
at America...</i>

628
00:25:05,405 --> 00:25:06,671
Roger!

629
00:25:06,673 --> 00:25:08,506
<i>...and, as I say, it's now
the portrait of Dorian Kelly,</i>

630
00:25:08,508 --> 00:25:09,941
<i>not the portrait
of Dorian Gray.</i>

631
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:13,411
Give me a day to figure out
how we hit Trump back.

632
00:25:13,413 --> 00:25:14,546
Stop by later.

633
00:25:14,548 --> 00:25:16,381
I don't want my kids
hearing this crap.

634
00:25:16,383 --> 00:25:17,951
Ignore the damn morons.

635
00:25:18,785 --> 00:25:20,485
I'm old, fat, and ugly.

636
00:25:20,487 --> 00:25:22,887
Christ,
they call me Jabba the Hutt.

637
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:27,358
Hemophilia swells my joints.
Can't exercise.

638
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,661
I feel fine,
but I look like shit.

639
00:25:29,663 --> 00:25:31,963
I look the opposite
of how I feel.

640
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:35,235
Do I let it affect me?
No, I do not.

641
00:25:36,503 --> 00:25:38,470
<i>This isn't entirely true.</i>

642
00:25:38,472 --> 00:25:39,904
<i>Roger is also fat</i>

643
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:41,573
<i>because he'll get
a room-service menu</i>

644
00:25:41,575 --> 00:25:42,674
<i>and order page two.</i>

645
00:25:42,676 --> 00:25:44,743
No goddamn orange on Fox!

646
00:25:44,745 --> 00:25:46,578
<i>But he cares a lot
about looks.</i>

647
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,879
Fucking idiots.

648
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:49,814
Let's turn our attention
to South Korea.

649
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:50,982
South Korean officials say

650
00:25:50,984 --> 00:25:53,752
talks with the north have
adjourned until tomorrow...

651
00:25:53,754 --> 00:25:55,053
<i>Early on, he realized</i>

652
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:57,088
<i>for a network to stay on
24 hours a day,</i>

653
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,691
<i>you need something
to hold an audience.</i>

654
00:25:59,693 --> 00:26:00,892
Joining me to discuss

655
00:26:00,894 --> 00:26:02,694
the Korean peninsula
is Seth Choy...

656
00:26:02,696 --> 00:26:05,597
<i>That something is legs.</i>

657
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:07,467
There's a reason
for clear desks.

658
00:26:08,602 --> 00:26:11,436
We need you
in a shorter dress.

659
00:26:11,438 --> 00:26:12,570
<i>But you know
that they're gonna take...</i>

660
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:14,574
Wide shot! Wider!

661
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:16,407
Go to the wide shot!

662
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,109
I want to see
her goddamn legs.

663
00:26:18,111 --> 00:26:20,044
Why the fuck
do you think I hired her?

664
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:21,446
<i>But this might
be seen by racial activists</i>

665
00:26:21,448 --> 00:26:22,749
<i>purely
through the racial prism.</i>

666
00:26:25,852 --> 00:26:28,119
Uh, stand up
and give me a spin.

667
00:26:28,121 --> 00:26:30,524
- Really?
- Yeah, it's a visual medium.

668
00:26:35,862 --> 00:26:38,696
Yeah.
That's good. Sit down.

669
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:40,565
I support the wall. I do.

670
00:26:40,567 --> 00:26:42,734
But mass deportations,
come on.

671
00:26:42,736 --> 00:26:43,835
That'll never work

672
00:26:43,837 --> 00:26:46,070
because of the 14th Amendment.
You want me to quote it?

673
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:47,605
"If you were born in America,

674
00:26:47,607 --> 00:26:49,607
"you're an American, period.
Period."

675
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:51,576
Get me
a demographically friendly

676
00:26:51,578 --> 00:26:53,511
Hispanic woman on immigration.

677
00:26:53,513 --> 00:26:56,915
But, hey, she needs to be
very demographically friendly.

678
00:26:56,917 --> 00:26:59,452
Okay. Uh, new girl's up.
Kayla.

679
00:27:00,654 --> 00:27:02,020
Hi, sir.

680
00:27:02,022 --> 00:27:04,088
So, I was listening to
Rush Limbaugh this morning.

681
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,958
He said something kind of cool
about Anthony Weiner.

682
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,994
How he's an exhibitionist
in every aspect

683
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:12,697
of how he presents himself
politically.

684
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:13,765
Oh, my God.

685
00:27:13,767 --> 00:27:15,667
Is she the best
you can do?

686
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:18,803
Bill Shine asked us
to give her a try, so...

687
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:21,975
Okay, let's not lose
focus. Back to immigration.

688
00:27:22,676 --> 00:27:24,175
Oh, my gosh.

689
00:27:24,177 --> 00:27:25,577
I can't get fired.

690
00:27:25,579 --> 00:27:28,546
This is the only job
I have ever wanted.

691
00:27:28,548 --> 00:27:31,783
I don't wanna be on TV,
I wanna be on Fox.

692
00:27:31,785 --> 00:27:34,652
Uh-huh.
- My family, every day,

693
00:27:34,654 --> 00:27:37,088
every holiday,
especially holidays,

694
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,556
they watch Fox News.

695
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:40,425
We're like addicts.

696
00:27:40,427 --> 00:27:41,759
Fox is how we do church.

697
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:43,061
You know when they made
the corner logo turn...

698
00:27:43,063 --> 00:27:44,195
The bug.

699
00:27:44,197 --> 00:27:46,798
...because folks had "Fox"
burned into their TV screens?

700
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,932
That's us.

701
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:49,534
Kayla,
you're not getting fired.

702
00:27:49,536 --> 00:27:51,002
He cannot scale his anger.

703
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:52,670
He's a perpetual
outrage machine.

704
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:54,906
That's why crazies love him.
No offense to your family.

705
00:27:54,908 --> 00:27:57,209
You want to do the folders?
No crying at Fox.

706
00:27:57,211 --> 00:27:58,411
No crying.

707
00:28:00,547 --> 00:28:03,681
Let me explain
your mistake here.

708
00:28:03,683 --> 00:28:05,683
So, Rush is on Hannity's team.

709
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:07,852
They're the competition.
They're GOP party hacks.

710
00:28:07,854 --> 00:28:09,454
So, he thinks
he's way ahead of them,

711
00:28:09,456 --> 00:28:11,689
so steal from Drudge
and Breitbart, not talk radio.

712
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:12,657
Okay.

713
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:14,559
Also, stop worrying
if the story's legit.

714
00:28:14,561 --> 00:28:15,627
If you can't source it,

715
00:28:15,629 --> 00:28:17,562
just go with,
"Some are saying."

716
00:28:17,564 --> 00:28:18,632
Seriously?

717
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:21,499
You have to adopt

718
00:28:21,501 --> 00:28:23,134
the mentality of
an Irish street cop.

719
00:28:23,136 --> 00:28:26,170
The world is a bad place,
people are lazy morons,

720
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:27,605
minorities are criminals,

721
00:28:27,607 --> 00:28:29,474
sex is sick,
but interesting.

722
00:28:29,476 --> 00:28:31,876
Ask yourself, "What would
scare my grandmother,

723
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:33,811
"or piss off my grandfather?"

724
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:36,481
And that's a Fox story.
Are you writing this down?

725
00:28:36,483 --> 00:28:37,682
Oh, it makes
so much sense.

726
00:28:37,684 --> 00:28:39,050
- Frighten, titillate.
- Right.

727
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:42,254
Frighten, titillate.
Frighten, titillate.

728
00:28:42,256 --> 00:28:43,655
When you're starting
the story,

729
00:28:43,657 --> 00:28:44,956
you need to start
with a clear villain.

730
00:28:46,626 --> 00:28:48,793
Liberal judge,
pinhead mayor,

731
00:28:48,795 --> 00:28:51,029
- Vermont, Hollywood.
- Uh-huh.

732
00:28:51,031 --> 00:28:52,730
Conservatives
want to conserve.

733
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:54,868
- Uh-huh.
- You're the last defense

734
00:28:56,803 --> 00:28:59,037
against Jesus-hating,
trans-loving,

735
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,674
Clinton-controlled
Armageddon, baby.

736
00:29:02,676 --> 00:29:04,642
Oh, come on.

737
00:29:04,644 --> 00:29:07,514
You do believe
some of that, right?

738
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:09,115
Yeah.

739
00:29:10,217 --> 00:29:11,618
Uh...

740
00:29:17,991 --> 00:29:19,557
That's quite a face
you have.

741
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:21,125
Really?

742
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:22,829
Thank you.

743
00:29:24,164 --> 00:29:25,230
I'm drunk.

744
00:29:25,232 --> 00:29:26,731
I'm drunk as well.

745
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:36,210
You have a Hillary poster
in your house.

746
00:29:37,077 --> 00:29:38,745
I guess I do.

747
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,613
Okay, my parents
would be horrified

748
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:43,984
if I went home
with a Democrat.

749
00:29:45,552 --> 00:29:48,152
The lesbianism, however?

750
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:49,756
Oh, I'm not a lesbian.

751
00:29:50,724 --> 00:29:52,890
I'm not a Democrat.

752
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:56,162
I just have two giant
Hillary posters in my kitchen.

753
00:29:57,831 --> 00:29:59,564
As a joke, though, right?

754
00:29:59,566 --> 00:30:02,567
No. That's who
I'd like to be the President.

755
00:30:02,569 --> 00:30:04,336
Are you serious?

756
00:30:04,338 --> 00:30:06,938
I'm a closeted Democrat.

757
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,573
At Fox News?

758
00:30:08,575 --> 00:30:10,275
Oh, my God.
I thought that you knew that.

759
00:30:10,277 --> 00:30:13,177
No, I didn't know that.
Does anyone know that?

760
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:15,780
Can you not tell?
You can't tell anyone.

761
00:30:15,782 --> 00:30:17,517
- Of course I won't tell.
- No, I'm so serious.

762
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:19,819
- Can I ask something?
- Mmm-hmm.

763
00:30:21,621 --> 00:30:23,224
Why do you work at Fox?

764
00:30:24,325 --> 00:30:27,825
Why don't you work
at MSNBC or something?

765
00:30:27,827 --> 00:30:32,063
I think I, like,
thrive in toxic environments.

766
00:30:32,065 --> 00:30:34,201
I never know
if you're kidding or not.

767
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:35,967
I am kidding.

768
00:30:35,969 --> 00:30:38,169
I applied everywhere

769
00:30:38,171 --> 00:30:40,339
and I got a job at Fox.

770
00:30:40,341 --> 00:30:42,607
And I keep applying
to other places

771
00:30:42,609 --> 00:30:45,578
and they keep not taking me
because I work at Fox.

772
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:49,616
Oh, my gosh.

773
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:52,116
It's okay.

774
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:54,685
One day I'm gonna be free.

775
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:55,853
What? It's not that bad.

776
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:59,090
If you're gay,
it's pretty bad.

777
00:30:59,092 --> 00:31:02,060
Well, yeah, you don't
wanna be gay at Fox.

778
00:31:02,062 --> 00:31:05,730
You work for Bill O'Reilly
and you have a Hillary poster?

779
00:31:05,732 --> 00:31:06,697
You do know he likes to

780
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:08,733
call up female producers
and whack off, right?

781
00:31:08,735 --> 00:31:09,834
Bill?

782
00:31:09,836 --> 00:31:11,236
Yes, Bill.

783
00:31:11,238 --> 00:31:12,371
No.

784
00:31:12,373 --> 00:31:14,373
You haven't heard about
the Andrea Mackris lawsuit?

785
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:16,641
- No.
- Oh, my God.

786
00:31:16,643 --> 00:31:18,210
This should be
in the welcome packet.

787
00:31:18,212 --> 00:31:20,711
She was one of
his associate producers.

788
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:22,880
He took her,
and only her,

789
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,349
to the Republican
National Convention.

790
00:31:24,351 --> 00:31:26,084
Called her up at 11:00,

791
00:31:26,086 --> 00:31:27,085
touching himself

792
00:31:27,087 --> 00:31:29,087
and telling her
what he wanted to do to her

793
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:30,822
with the old falafel.

794
00:31:30,824 --> 00:31:33,057
Are you kidding?

795
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:34,859
It's on the internet.

796
00:31:34,861 --> 00:31:38,863
And then, quote, "using
a vibrator upon himself."

797
00:31:38,865 --> 00:31:42,133
Like, he brought a vibrator
from home to the convention?

798
00:31:42,135 --> 00:31:43,435
Yes, well, you have to bring

799
00:31:43,437 --> 00:31:44,902
a vibrator from home
to the convention.

800
00:31:47,208 --> 00:31:50,041
The question is, what does
a man do with a vibrator?

801
00:31:52,145 --> 00:31:54,712
Do you place it
alongside the shaft?

802
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,386
I don't wanna hear that.

803
00:32:01,388 --> 00:32:02,956
"Fucking die, bitch."

804
00:32:03,957 --> 00:32:05,825
"If I see you,
you better run."

805
00:32:07,694 --> 00:32:09,863
"I wouldn't be sleeping
too soundly if I were you."

806
00:32:10,397 --> 00:32:11,929
Trump's lit the torches.

807
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:14,333
You're getting
security tonight.

808
00:32:14,335 --> 00:32:17,402
All I want is for this
to go away, Roger.

809
00:32:17,404 --> 00:32:19,371
Look, every general in history

810
00:32:19,373 --> 00:32:21,641
has gone into battle
feeling the same.

811
00:32:24,911 --> 00:32:25,912
Right.

812
00:32:27,448 --> 00:32:30,014
I'll read a statement
at the top, saying,

813
00:32:30,016 --> 00:32:33,084
"Yes, Trump is attacking me,
but I'm not going to respond."

814
00:32:33,086 --> 00:32:34,721
Any defense
will come from you.

815
00:32:38,892 --> 00:32:39,993
Not right now.

816
00:32:41,295 --> 00:32:43,995
You set a record
on viewer email.

817
00:32:43,997 --> 00:32:44,998
Let me guess.

818
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:47,301
None of it on my side.

819
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:49,033
No.

820
00:32:49,035 --> 00:32:50,835
Our audience loves Trump.

821
00:32:50,837 --> 00:32:54,005
A hell of a lot more
than the Murdochs realize.

822
00:32:54,007 --> 00:32:55,708
More than Trump knows.

823
00:32:56,843 --> 00:32:58,876
He's tweeting
we made peace.

824
00:32:58,878 --> 00:33:01,078
He'll come on <i>Fox & Friends</i>
tomorrow.

825
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,080
He needs us.
We need him.

826
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:04,418
It's got nothing
to do with you.

827
00:33:08,021 --> 00:33:09,388
All right. It's late.

828
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:11,057
I have dogs to feed.

829
00:33:27,408 --> 00:33:29,310
Just to be clear,

830
00:33:30,444 --> 00:33:33,844
I will not be
kissing Trump's ass at 9:00.

831
00:33:33,846 --> 00:33:36,914
We fight
tomorrow's fights tomorrow.

832
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:50,464
Can I see
that statement again, Bill?

833
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:55,400
Heard there was a dust-up
involving yours truly

834
00:33:55,402 --> 00:33:57,770
and presidential contender
Donald Trump.

835
00:33:59,072 --> 00:34:00,173
How you doing, Megyn?

836
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:04,010
Hanging in there.

837
00:34:05,579 --> 00:34:07,046
Give him hell, Megyn.

838
00:34:13,753 --> 00:34:15,220
<i>Okay, quiet on the set.</i>

839
00:34:15,222 --> 00:34:18,758
<i>We go live in five, four,
three, two...</i>

840
00:34:20,126 --> 00:34:21,826
I just got back
from a weekend at the beach

841
00:34:21,828 --> 00:34:22,927
with my husband
and my three kids.

842
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:24,862
Did anything happen
in the news while I was gone?

843
00:34:24,864 --> 00:34:26,331
You may have heard

844
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:28,200
there was a dust-up
involving yours truly

845
00:34:28,202 --> 00:34:30,369
and presidential contender
Donald Trump.

846
00:34:30,371 --> 00:34:32,439
Mr. Trump was upset
with a question I asked...

847
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,140
Oh, cute baby.

848
00:34:36,142 --> 00:34:38,811
I gotta say,
I can't stand your show.

849
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,414
Oh.

850
00:34:41,147 --> 00:34:42,079
You guys at Fox,

851
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:45,217
you're doing terrible things
to our country.

852
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:47,086
Well, I hope
that makes you feel better.

853
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:50,389
How you treat
people you disagree with

854
00:34:50,391 --> 00:34:52,226
says everything about you.

855
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:03,201
<i>You know, I mean, Jesus was
a white man too, you know?</i>

856
00:35:03,203 --> 00:35:04,902
<i>It's like,
he was an historical figure.</i>

857
00:35:04,904 --> 00:35:06,170
<i>I mean,
that's a verifiable fact.</i>

858
00:35:06,172 --> 00:35:08,473
<i>As is Santa. I just want the
kids watching to know that.</i>

859
00:35:08,475 --> 00:35:11,108
<i>But my point is,
how do you just revise it</i>

860
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,910
<i>and change Santa
from white to black?</i>

861
00:35:12,912 --> 00:35:14,448
<i>I mean, you can't. Not really.</i>

862
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:19,618
Wow.

863
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,386
Nice dress.

864
00:35:21,388 --> 00:35:23,921
I hope you don't
wear that to Sunday service.

865
00:35:23,923 --> 00:35:25,956
Please. I have church jeans,

866
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:28,329
so I can hold a latte
on my knee.

867
00:35:29,896 --> 00:35:31,496
Oh, my God. Kayla.

868
00:35:31,498 --> 00:35:33,066
- Did you see this?
- What?

869
00:35:37,638 --> 00:35:38,938
I'm a creep.

870
00:35:40,173 --> 00:35:42,474
- That is gross.
- I know.

871
00:35:42,476 --> 00:35:45,178
I love that.

872
00:35:48,415 --> 00:35:49,481
Are you crazy?

873
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:50,649
What?

874
00:35:50,651 --> 00:35:52,852
That's my friend from college.

875
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,420
I'm just
looking out for you.

876
00:35:55,422 --> 00:35:56,987
Who are you stalking?

877
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:57,990
No one.

878
00:36:12,306 --> 00:36:13,873
I feel for you.

879
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:16,541
That show.

880
00:36:16,543 --> 00:36:19,211
Oh, his bark is worse
than his bite.

881
00:36:19,213 --> 00:36:20,645
Well, I work for Roger.

882
00:36:20,647 --> 00:36:23,182
We have two, three
and four-donut days.

883
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,150
Sugar does make
everybody crazy.

884
00:36:26,152 --> 00:36:27,486
No, these aren't donuts
he eats.

885
00:36:27,488 --> 00:36:29,956
They're donuts he throws.
At somebody.

886
00:36:32,925 --> 00:36:36,428
No,
he's a pussycat.

887
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:39,498
Come say hi. We're always
looking for on-air talent.

888
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,201
- Oh, really?
- Mmm.

889
00:36:42,569 --> 00:36:43,570
Now?

890
00:36:45,572 --> 00:36:46,738
Sure.

891
00:36:52,011 --> 00:36:53,514
That's Roger's
private elevator.

892
00:36:55,047 --> 00:36:56,916
Hang on a sec.

893
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,628
Mmm-hmm.

894
00:37:08,762 --> 00:37:10,027
Hello.

895
00:37:10,029 --> 00:37:12,098
- Ah, have a seat.
- Thank you.

896
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:16,301
Liberals don't get Megyn.

897
00:37:16,303 --> 00:37:19,671
She's a star not because
she thinks Santa's white,

898
00:37:19,673 --> 00:37:21,706
- but because she'll say it.
- That's right.

899
00:37:21,708 --> 00:37:24,209
Yeah, few have courage
in the spotlight.

900
00:37:24,211 --> 00:37:25,677
It's powerful to watch.

901
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:28,280
And she went up 30%
that quarter.

902
00:37:28,282 --> 00:37:30,382
Well, that, too.

903
00:37:30,384 --> 00:37:33,618
All audiences want
is authenticity.

904
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,353
- Mmm.
- For 200 years,

905
00:37:35,355 --> 00:37:36,721
Santa's a fat white guy.

906
00:37:36,723 --> 00:37:38,490
They think Santa,

907
00:37:38,492 --> 00:37:39,591
- that's what they see.
- Right.

908
00:37:39,593 --> 00:37:41,460
You want to
change that? Fine.

909
00:37:41,462 --> 00:37:44,563
Let's discuss it without you
calling my people racist.

910
00:37:44,565 --> 00:37:45,697
Exactly.

911
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:48,500
A liberal is somebody
who wants to live in a future

912
00:37:48,502 --> 00:37:50,535
that he is too lazy

913
00:37:50,537 --> 00:37:53,438
or too arrogant
to actually create.

914
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,675
Well, in my family,
Santa's always been white

915
00:37:56,677 --> 00:38:00,110
and, according to my
granddaddy, a communist.

916
00:38:01,415 --> 00:38:03,584
So, that's my family.

917
00:38:05,552 --> 00:38:08,085
So, what can I do
for you, Kayla?

918
00:38:08,087 --> 00:38:10,822
Why did you
drop by to see me?

919
00:38:10,824 --> 00:38:12,824
Well, the thing is, sir,

920
00:38:12,826 --> 00:38:15,227
I actually started on-air
during college

921
00:38:15,229 --> 00:38:17,362
in Central Florida. Weather.

922
00:38:17,364 --> 00:38:20,197
I want
to convince you

923
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:23,167
that that is where I
belong, Mr. Ailes.

924
00:38:23,169 --> 00:38:25,504
I think I'd be freakin'
phenomenal on your network.

925
00:38:25,506 --> 00:38:28,208
Well, it's
Mr. Murdoch's air,

926
00:38:29,343 --> 00:38:32,744
but I did create it.
I do run it.

927
00:38:32,746 --> 00:38:33,812
Right.

928
00:38:33,814 --> 00:38:35,249
You have a pretty face.

929
00:38:37,217 --> 00:38:40,117
Here, uh, stand up
and give me a twirl.

930
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:41,253
Now?

931
00:38:41,255 --> 00:38:43,355
Yeah.
Just a quick spin.

932
00:38:43,357 --> 00:38:44,791
Oh. Sure.

933
00:38:55,202 --> 00:38:57,369
That's very good.

934
00:38:57,371 --> 00:39:02,108
Now, uh, pull your dress up
and let me see your legs.

935
00:39:07,614 --> 00:39:08,715
Um...

936
00:39:16,155 --> 00:39:17,791
It's a visual medium, Kayla.

937
00:39:19,826 --> 00:39:20,827
Come on.

938
00:39:29,636 --> 00:39:30,771
Higher.

939
00:39:47,153 --> 00:39:48,555
Come on. Higher.

940
00:40:11,645 --> 00:40:12,846
That's fine, Kayla.

941
00:40:16,283 --> 00:40:17,484
Why don't you
sit down?

942
00:40:28,829 --> 00:40:29,894
Thank you.

943
00:40:29,896 --> 00:40:30,897
Mmm-hmm.

944
00:40:32,633 --> 00:40:34,499
You have a great body.

945
00:40:34,501 --> 00:40:35,602
Thank you.

946
00:40:40,741 --> 00:40:42,141
Mr. Ailes...

947
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:47,212
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't mention this...

948
00:40:47,214 --> 00:40:49,347
- No, no, of course.
- ...to anyone.

949
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:50,782
I'm here to help
my employees,

950
00:40:50,784 --> 00:40:53,218
- not hurt them.
- It would just sound...

951
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:56,221
Anything that happens
here, in this room,

952
00:40:56,223 --> 00:40:59,424
is strictly
between you and me.

953
00:40:59,426 --> 00:41:01,828
- Okay.
- Of course, it cuts both ways.

954
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,631
I'm discreet,

955
00:41:06,433 --> 00:41:08,301
but unforgiving.

956
00:41:17,577 --> 00:41:20,714
Success in
broadcast television

957
00:41:21,615 --> 00:41:23,548
is hard.
It's arbitrary.

958
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:26,185
This is the most competitive
industry on earth.

959
00:41:27,554 --> 00:41:28,920
You understand
what I'm saying?

960
00:41:28,922 --> 00:41:30,290
Mmm-hmm.

961
00:41:30,857 --> 00:41:32,325
We could work together.

962
00:41:34,461 --> 00:41:37,562
I could pluck you out
and move you

963
00:41:37,564 --> 00:41:39,633
all the way
to the front of the line.

964
00:41:41,668 --> 00:41:43,437
But I want
something in return.

965
00:41:47,808 --> 00:41:49,910
Do you know
what that is, Kayla?

966
00:41:53,747 --> 00:41:55,615
Loyalty.

967
00:41:57,584 --> 00:41:59,586
I need to know
that you're loyal.

968
00:42:01,655 --> 00:42:05,325
I need you to find
a way to prove it.

969
00:42:06,927 --> 00:42:08,059
Mmm-hmm.

970
00:42:08,061 --> 00:42:09,730
You think about that,
all right?

971
00:42:15,836 --> 00:42:17,471
So, we'll talk again?

972
00:42:19,339 --> 00:42:21,341
Faye can show you
the way out.

973
00:42:21,842 --> 00:42:23,009
Thank you, sir.

974
00:42:45,632 --> 00:42:47,601
Jess. Jess.

975
00:42:52,572 --> 00:42:55,675
Something really weird
just happened.

976
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:00,612
I just went
to say hi to...

977
00:43:00,614 --> 00:43:04,518
I just... I met...
I was invited to meet Roger.

978
00:43:06,453 --> 00:43:07,621
I mean, nothing...

979
00:43:08,655 --> 00:43:10,421
Nothing happened.

980
00:43:10,423 --> 00:43:11,625
Kayla.

981
00:43:13,093 --> 00:43:15,426
It's actually
better for you

982
00:43:15,428 --> 00:43:16,763
if you don't
involve me in this.

983
00:43:19,566 --> 00:43:21,468
Um, 'cause they know
that we're friends.

984
00:43:22,803 --> 00:43:24,004
I'm sorry.

985
00:43:24,938 --> 00:43:25,939
Okay.

986
00:43:26,773 --> 00:43:27,941
This place is crazy.

987
00:43:37,584 --> 00:43:39,417
No Trump. No KKK.

988
00:43:39,419 --> 00:43:40,718
No fascist USA.

989
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,687
- Jesus.
- Okay, we're here.

990
00:43:42,689 --> 00:43:44,389
<i>His assistant's name is Rhona.</i>

991
00:43:44,391 --> 00:43:46,024
<i>The security guard is Keith...</i>

992
00:43:46,026 --> 00:43:47,091
Got it.

993
00:43:47,093 --> 00:43:49,794
Gil, last words?

994
00:43:49,796 --> 00:43:51,731
<i>Yeah, don't piss him off.
I need this job.</i>

995
00:43:52,165 --> 00:43:53,531
<i>Good luck.</i>

996
00:43:53,533 --> 00:43:54,835
I'll be waiting
right here, okay?

997
00:44:06,112 --> 00:44:07,113
Are you
happy now, bitch?

998
00:44:10,083 --> 00:44:12,183
<i>During the day,
if I'm in the office,</i>

999
00:44:12,185 --> 00:44:13,952
<i>I have a number of people</i>

1000
00:44:13,954 --> 00:44:15,486
<i>that I'll just call out
a tweet to.</i>

1001
00:44:15,488 --> 00:44:16,788
<i>It's always my right.</i>

1002
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:18,523
<i>You probably had some pretty
nasty tweets sent your way.</i>

1003
00:44:18,525 --> 00:44:19,657
<i>I don't want that to happen.</i>

1004
00:44:19,659 --> 00:44:20,892
<i>I have fans
that really love...</i>

1005
00:44:20,894 --> 00:44:23,761
<i>But you retweet some of those.
It's not just the fans.</i>

1006
00:44:23,763 --> 00:44:25,430
<i>But not
the more nasty ones.</i>

1007
00:44:25,432 --> 00:44:27,565
<i>You would be amazed
at the ones I don't retweet.</i>

1008
00:44:27,567 --> 00:44:29,133
<i>"Bimbo"?</i>

1009
00:44:29,135 --> 00:44:32,670
<i>Uh, well, that was a retweet.
Yeah, did I say that?</i>

1010
00:44:32,672 --> 00:44:35,440
<i>Many times.
Ooh, okay. Excuse me.</i>

1011
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:39,010
<i>But not the most
horrible thing, you know.</i>

1012
00:44:39,012 --> 00:44:41,646
<i>Over your life, Megyn, you've
been called a lot worse.</i>

1013
00:44:41,648 --> 00:44:43,215
- <i>Is that right?</i>
- All right, that's enough.

1014
00:44:43,217 --> 00:44:44,983
<i>It's not about me.
It's not about me.</i>

1015
00:44:44,985 --> 00:44:46,920
Well, what do you think?

1016
00:44:48,622 --> 00:44:50,755
I think
you're too solicitous.

1017
00:44:50,757 --> 00:44:52,624
Thank you.

1018
00:44:52,626 --> 00:44:54,859
But this once, I can handle
a straight-up positive.

1019
00:44:54,861 --> 00:44:56,594
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

1020
00:44:56,596 --> 00:44:59,998
He attacks you
for a year straight

1021
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,901
and you let him off
with a fucking "oops."

1022
00:45:02,903 --> 00:45:05,003
What?
I don't let him off.

1023
00:45:05,005 --> 00:45:08,573
I confront him.
I used Donald Trump.

1024
00:45:08,575 --> 00:45:10,575
Honey, you absolved him.

1025
00:45:10,577 --> 00:45:11,910
Doug, there are internal

1026
00:45:11,912 --> 00:45:13,645
political pressures
at play here as well.

1027
00:45:13,647 --> 00:45:15,513
Yeah, yeah. I bet.
I get it, Gil.

1028
00:45:15,515 --> 00:45:16,981
You know what,
can we have a second, guys?

1029
00:45:16,983 --> 00:45:18,151
Please.

1030
00:45:22,689 --> 00:45:24,656
I'm not trying to be critical.
I just...

1031
00:45:24,658 --> 00:45:26,724
Well, you are.
I made this go away.

1032
00:45:26,726 --> 00:45:29,894
I stopped his
harassing bullshit. For us.

1033
00:45:29,896 --> 00:45:32,196
I never
asked you to do that.

1034
00:45:32,198 --> 00:45:33,498
He is going to be

1035
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,133
the Republican candidate
for President.

1036
00:45:35,135 --> 00:45:37,001
I'm a news anchor.
I need access to him.

1037
00:45:37,003 --> 00:45:39,704
You need access?
At what fucking price?

1038
00:45:39,706 --> 00:45:43,675
At what price? The price
of our apartment. My salary.

1039
00:45:43,677 --> 00:45:46,012
That pays our fucking bills.

1040
00:45:56,056 --> 00:45:57,956
- Look. For the record...
- No. You know what?

1041
00:45:57,958 --> 00:45:59,492
It's been a shitty year!

1042
00:46:00,927 --> 00:46:02,593
Really fucking shitty year,

1043
00:46:02,595 --> 00:46:04,796
and I'm allowed
to want it over.

1044
00:46:05,932 --> 00:46:07,000
You are.

1045
00:46:08,768 --> 00:46:10,635
Fuck.

1046
00:46:10,637 --> 00:46:13,171
So, what I'm saying is,
do we really need AR-15s

1047
00:46:13,173 --> 00:46:14,806
to be able to hunt deer,

1048
00:46:14,808 --> 00:46:15,873
protect our families?

1049
00:46:15,875 --> 00:46:20,212
I'm in favor of people
being able to carry handguns.

1050
00:46:20,214 --> 00:46:22,180
Some of these mass shootings
would have been less deadly

1051
00:46:22,182 --> 00:46:23,648
if that had been the case.

1052
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:26,951
But I'm also with
the majority today,

1053
00:46:26,953 --> 00:46:30,289
taking a stand against
semiautomatic assault weapons.

1054
00:46:30,291 --> 00:46:32,156
Which brings us back
to the question of the day.

1055
00:46:32,158 --> 00:46:36,694
Should Congress reinstate
the Assault Weapons Ban?

1056
00:46:36,696 --> 00:46:39,032
I know a lot of you
don't agree with me.

1057
00:46:39,666 --> 00:46:40,734
That's fine.

1058
00:46:42,635 --> 00:46:43,636
Huh.

1059
00:46:44,604 --> 00:46:46,106
89% of you say no.

1060
00:46:48,074 --> 00:46:50,076
And that's what makes
America great.

1061
00:46:52,645 --> 00:46:54,313
- Clear.
- Great.

1062
00:46:54,315 --> 00:46:56,182
The second floor
wants to see you.

1063
00:46:57,251 --> 00:46:58,618
- Now?
- Yeah.

1064
00:47:03,023 --> 00:47:04,190
This is Kayla.

1065
00:47:06,327 --> 00:47:07,827
Hi.

1066
00:47:09,596 --> 00:47:11,064
Mmm-hmm.

1067
00:47:14,901 --> 00:47:16,736
Yeah. I'll come
right up then.

1068
00:48:26,273 --> 00:48:27,274
Ladies.

1069
00:48:28,242 --> 00:48:29,276
Hi.

1070
00:48:51,164 --> 00:48:52,366
Phew. Hot in here.

1071
00:49:20,427 --> 00:49:23,027
Gretchen.
Well, how are you?

1072
00:49:23,029 --> 00:49:26,398
- Faye, I miss our lunches.
- Mmm.

1073
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,901
- Roger wants to see me?
- Oh.

1074
00:49:29,903 --> 00:49:31,871
Uh, no, I think
it was Dianne.

1075
00:49:33,207 --> 00:49:34,874
I just saw her in with Bill.

1076
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:37,810
All right. Well...

1077
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:42,381
See you ladies later then.

1078
00:49:42,383 --> 00:49:44,015
Bye.

1079
00:49:44,017 --> 00:49:45,816
Roger's ready
for you, Kayla.

1080
00:49:47,321 --> 00:49:48,819
Okay.

1081
00:49:57,398 --> 00:49:59,764
Never stops.

1082
00:49:59,766 --> 00:50:02,099
Gretchen, you've been
such an instrumental part

1083
00:50:02,101 --> 00:50:03,268
of the Fox family.

1084
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:04,969
Absolutely.

1085
00:50:04,971 --> 00:50:06,205
We just
wanted to tell you

1086
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:08,172
that we appreciated
the work...

1087
00:50:08,174 --> 00:50:09,776
He's firing me,
isn't he?

1088
00:50:12,346 --> 00:50:13,347
Yes.

1089
00:50:17,518 --> 00:50:19,052
You wanna
tell me why?

1090
00:50:28,562 --> 00:50:30,094
<i>What could they say?</i>

1091
00:50:30,096 --> 00:50:32,198
<i>"You're sexy,
but you're too much work.</i>

1092
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,400
<i>"You're a man-hater.</i>

1093
00:50:35,402 --> 00:50:38,104
<i>"To get ahead
you gotta give a little head."</i>

1094
00:50:44,143 --> 00:50:46,511
Good luck, Ms. Carlson.

1095
00:50:46,513 --> 00:50:48,946
<i>Do you know why
we dress soldiers the same?</i>

1096
00:50:48,948 --> 00:50:51,115
<i>So everybody knows
they're replaceable.</i>

1097
00:50:53,987 --> 00:50:55,389
<i>I refuse to be replaceable.</i>

1098
00:50:59,993 --> 00:51:02,227
Well, they finally
did it. I'm out.

1099
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:03,328
<i>Did they
give you a cause?</i>

1100
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:06,498
- No.
- <i>Good. Ready to go to war?</i>

1101
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,935
Oh, yeah.
I'm ready.

1102
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:25,384
Murdoch here.

1103
00:51:25,386 --> 00:51:27,352
<i>Funny.
Have you seen the lawsuit?</i>

1104
00:51:27,354 --> 00:51:28,986
Which lawsuit?

1105
00:51:32,426 --> 00:51:33,558
I'm not stopping.

1106
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,993
<i>Roger's being sued

1107

<i>Morning.</i>

1114
00:51:52,011 --> 00:51:54,881
<i>So, this employee
has sued Roger personally.</i>

1115
00:51:56,983 --> 00:51:58,519
He doesn't know
who she is.

1116
00:51:59,653 --> 00:52:01,553
Are you familiar
with Ms. Carlson?

1117
00:52:01,555 --> 00:52:03,988
No. Until two hours ago,
I'd never heard of her.

1118
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:06,891
More importantly, no one heard
from her after she was fired.

1119
00:52:06,893 --> 00:52:08,893
Wait. Not even to
negotiate a severance?

1120
00:52:08,895 --> 00:52:10,127
<i>No. And that suggests</i>

1121
00:52:10,129 --> 00:52:12,997
she knew it was coming
and she had a plan.

1122
00:52:12,999 --> 00:52:15,467
<i>As News Corp attorney,

<i>an internal investigation
into Roger's behavior.</i>

1124
00:52:18,037 --> 00:52:21,172
I know you two
have had issues with him.

1125
00:52:21,174 --> 00:52:24,108
I need everyone's attention.
Listen up, people!

1126
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:28,179
A <i>Post</i> employee has received

That's just above us.

1128
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:31,015
Close the goddamn vents!

1129
00:52:31,017 --> 00:52:32,083
All of them!

1130
00:52:32,085 --> 00:52:34,286
- Roger.
- And nobody opens the mail!

1131
00:52:34,288 --> 00:52:36,153
- Roger.
- We're under attack!

1132
00:52:36,155 --> 00:52:38,089
Roger! Hey!

1133
00:52:38,091 --> 00:52:40,525
Everything upstairs

1134
00:52:40,527 --> 00:52:42,095
You need to calm down.

Do not give orders

If it were yours,

1137
00:52:47,634 --> 00:52:48,901
you'd own it.

1138
00:52:52,004 --> 00:52:55,240
It's okay, everyone. Everything's
gonna be fine. You can go back to work.

Holy shit!

1154
00:53:53,734 --> 00:53:55,101
No way.

00:53:58,205 --> 00:54:01,105
Josh. Get me a nice shot

00:54:01,107 --> 00:54:03,341

When you're photographing for my

1158
00:54:07,581 --> 00:54:09,381
Okay.

1159
00:54:09,383 --> 00:54:10,684
Hoodies are creepy.

00:54:11,251 --> 00:54:13,052
Thank you. Thank you.

00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,460

Mmm.

1164
00:54:26,767 --> 00:54:28,702
Sushi's not liberal food.

No.

1189
00:55:46,178 --> 00:55:47,612
<i>Beth,</i>
<i>I just talked to</i> TheWrap.

1190
00:55:47,614 --> 00:55:50,348
It's an online publication.
I said, how sad it is

we've got this woman
making these complaints

1192
00:55:53,253 --> 00:55:56,153

1193
00:55:56,155 --> 00:55:57,756
I know, Roger.
I told <i>People</i> magazine

1194
00:55:57,758 --> 00:56:00,458
we've been in your office
alone a lot over 15 years.

1195
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:02,294
I've never seen anything

1196
00:56:02,296 --> 00:56:03,862
I said, "I don't think

00:56:03,864 --> 00:56:04,796
"has a friend
in the building."

1198
00:56:04,798 --> 00:56:06,665
I know, Roger.
Someone would've told me.

1199
00:56:06,667 --> 00:56:07,899
They're gonna quote me
on that.

1200
00:56:07,901 --> 00:56:09,066
Not a ring of truth.

1201
00:56:09,068 --> 00:56:12,169
Maria Bartiromo
sent <i>Variety</i> a stock chart.

1202
00:56:12,171 --> 00:56:13,672
- Oh, hey, we're up.
- Whoo-hoo.

1203
00:56:13,674 --> 00:56:16,274
Hannity tweeted, "I talked to
hundreds of women at Fox this week,

- Yeah.

Because it's bullshit.

1216
00:56:35,127 --> 00:56:37,862
They have a contractual right
to monitor our communications.

1217
00:56:37,864 --> 00:56:41,335
A hotline in this building is like
a complaint box in occupied Paris.

1218
00:56:42,769 --> 00:56:45,770
It's like we're telling women,
"Go on. Speak up for yourself.

"Just know the entire network

00:56:50,677 --> 00:56:52,410
They'll call you a liar.

1222
00:56:52,412 --> 00:56:55,513
Oh, and as for your career,
you want assignments and air time?

1223
00:56:55,515 --> 00:56:56,881
Go ahead.
Call the paranoid man

1224
00:56:56,883 --> 00:56:58,450
who decides your salary
a pervert,

1225
00:56:58,452 --> 00:57:01,185
and do that on a fucking
anonymous hotline he controls.

1226
00:57:01,187 --> 00:57:03,855
On a phone he has
a contractual right to record.

1227
00:57:03,857 --> 00:57:06,458
Jesus fucking Christ,
do you think women are idiots?

1228
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:08,192
It's like
somebody stripped you naked

1229
00:57:08,194 --> 00:57:09,594
and they want you
to walk through this office

1230
00:57:09,596 --> 00:57:11,197
just to fucking prove it.

1231
00:57:11,798 --> 00:57:12,799
Okay.

1232
00:57:14,801 --> 00:57:16,837
Can I see you for a minute?

1233
00:57:25,912 --> 00:57:27,746
What the fuck was that?

1234
00:57:27,748 --> 00:57:29,483
I don't know, but I liked it.

1235
00:57:35,856 --> 00:57:37,689
I won't call you a feminist,

1236
00:57:37,691 --> 00:57:39,758
but say there's a spectrum,
you are...

1237
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,395
Roger harassed me.

1238
00:57:43,997 --> 00:57:45,399
Ten years ago.

1239
00:57:47,501 --> 00:57:49,668
I had turned down
a law-firm partnership

1240
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:52,737
for an entry-level job
here at Fox.

1241
00:57:52,739 --> 00:57:56,476
Roger would call me up to
New York to dangle prospects.

1242
00:57:58,412 --> 00:57:59,646
I wanted his help.

1243
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:04,451
Did you

1244
00:58:05,585 --> 00:58:06,720
do anything?

1245
00:58:07,554 --> 00:58:09,589
No.

1246
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:11,491
Will you talk?

1247
00:58:14,428 --> 00:58:16,294
- Megyn?
- I don't know.

1248
00:58:16,296 --> 00:58:17,397
I don't know.

1249
00:58:20,467 --> 00:58:22,235
I mean, going on the record...

1250
00:58:23,603 --> 00:58:26,304
Jesus.

1251
00:58:26,306 --> 00:58:28,907
It's basically admitting you're
the weak one in the herd.

1252
00:58:28,909 --> 00:58:31,976
No, it's admitting
you're the hot one.

1253
00:58:31,978 --> 00:58:33,645
It has nothing
to do with that, Gil.

1254
00:58:33,647 --> 00:58:35,413
- Say women.
- Oh, my God.

1255
00:58:35,415 --> 00:58:36,681
Look, there is a reason

1256
00:58:36,683 --> 00:58:38,516
certain women
can defend Roger.

1257
00:58:38,518 --> 00:58:40,752
If I report this and it leaks,

1258
00:58:40,754 --> 00:58:43,388
it will follow me
for the rest of my career.

1259
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:44,923
I don't wanna be defined
by Roger's bullshit.

1260
00:58:44,925 --> 00:58:48,460
I refuse to be the fucking poster
girl for sexual harassment.

1261
00:58:48,462 --> 00:58:51,429
He can't still be doing
that crap, right?

1262
00:58:51,431 --> 00:58:52,432
I mean, the man has a walker.

1263
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,535
- Viagra?
- Gil.

1264
00:58:56,703 --> 00:58:57,971
Help me here.

1265
00:58:58,905 --> 00:59:01,007
Please. How do I play this?

1266
00:59:02,809 --> 00:59:06,279
Well, you only ask
when you already know.

1267
00:59:08,782 --> 00:59:10,615
If I learned anything
this year,

1268
00:59:10,617 --> 00:59:11,816
it's to not get sucked
into a fight

1269
00:59:11,818 --> 00:59:13,987
with someone who has better
reason to be in it than you do.

1270
00:59:15,822 --> 00:59:16,890
Okay.

1271
00:59:18,558 --> 00:59:19,760
Okay.

1272
00:59:21,561 --> 00:59:23,396
So, what is it you wanna do?

1273
00:59:25,532 --> 00:59:27,332
For right now, nothing.

1274
00:59:27,334 --> 00:59:28,502
- Good.
- Good.

1275
00:59:50,524 --> 00:59:52,524
There she is.

1276
00:59:52,526 --> 00:59:54,459
Hi, Roger.

1277
00:59:54,461 --> 00:59:55,796
Hello, sweetheart.

1278
00:59:57,964 --> 00:59:59,531
Hi.

1279
00:59:59,533 --> 01:00:00,534
Sit, sit.

1280
01:00:01,601 --> 01:00:04,736
- You've met Mayor Giuliani before?
- Of course.

1281
01:00:04,738 --> 01:00:06,738
There's
an internal investigation,

1282
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:08,740
but I'm not gonna wait for it
to clear me.

1283
01:00:08,742 --> 01:00:11,476
The Republican convention
is less than two weeks away.

1284
01:00:11,478 --> 01:00:13,845
This is bullshit.
I'm gonna fight it.

1285
01:00:13,847 --> 01:00:15,513
The charges are absurd.

1286
01:00:15,515 --> 01:00:17,081
I'm in, Roger.

1287
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:19,717
I love that fate has given me
a chance to repay you

1288
01:00:19,719 --> 01:00:21,452
for when I was
in intensive care.

1289
01:00:21,454 --> 01:00:24,789
Roger called my idiot doctors
every day for four weeks.

1290
01:00:24,791 --> 01:00:26,090
Told them
he'd put me on the air

1291
01:00:26,092 --> 01:00:27,125
live from the hospital bed

1292
01:00:27,127 --> 01:00:30,028
if they didn't fix
every stitch of damage done.

1293
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:32,664
But I'm also here as someone

1294
01:00:32,666 --> 01:00:34,933
who has dealt with this issue
for years,

1295
01:00:34,935 --> 01:00:38,403
years on the side of women.

1296
01:00:38,405 --> 01:00:40,705
I don't wanna see
sexual violence trivialized.

1297
01:00:40,707 --> 01:00:44,676
I don't wanna see it become
some damn political football.

1298
01:00:44,678 --> 01:00:47,879
In that spirit, I need to ask,

1299
01:00:47,881 --> 01:00:50,715
will an investigation
find anything,

1300
01:00:50,717 --> 01:00:52,786
well, uncomfortable?

1301
01:00:55,422 --> 01:00:57,822
Well, define uncomfortable.

1302
01:00:57,824 --> 01:00:59,157
Roger, quote,

1303
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:00,758
"I think you and I
should have had

1304
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:03,027
"a sexual relationship
a long time ago.

1305
01:01:03,029 --> 01:01:04,596
"And then
you'd be good and better

1306
01:01:04,598 --> 01:01:05,730
"and I'd be good and better."

1307
01:01:05,732 --> 01:01:08,933
- Did you say that?
- No, I'm not a fool.

1308
01:01:08,935 --> 01:01:11,836
"You missed your chance for me
to harass you"? Come on.

1309
01:01:11,838 --> 01:01:13,605
I think they'll argue
it's solicitous.

1310
01:01:13,607 --> 01:01:17,108
Telling a woman she was
fuckable "a long time ago."

1311
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:18,810
Who the hell thinks
that works?

1312
01:01:18,812 --> 01:01:20,478
Why's she suing, Roger?

1313
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,081
Gretchen is
a very competitive woman

1314
01:01:23,083 --> 01:01:24,985
facing a severe
likability issue.

1315
01:01:26,052 --> 01:01:29,787
One that I shielded her from
for years.

1316
01:01:29,789 --> 01:01:31,623
Her career's over, I'm afraid.

1317
01:01:31,625 --> 01:01:32,924
And she can't take
a joke.

1318
01:01:32,926 --> 01:01:34,893
Roger is very salty.

1319
01:01:34,895 --> 01:01:38,796
I find it amusing.
It's my fault. I encourage it.

1320
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:42,000
James Murdoch
could be behind this.

1321
01:01:42,002 --> 01:01:44,168
His wife
openly supports Hillary.

1322
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:46,070
And it could go deeper.

1323
01:01:46,072 --> 01:01:47,972
I have good reason to believe

1324
01:01:47,974 --> 01:01:50,108
that inside
the Obama White House,

1325
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:51,476
there have been discussions,

1326
01:01:51,478 --> 01:01:53,446
on what level I do not know...

1327
01:01:54,915 --> 01:01:56,182
of having me killed.

1328
01:02:47,167 --> 01:02:48,468
Oh, Jesus.

1329
01:02:51,571 --> 01:02:52,772
- Hi, there.
- Hey.

1330
01:02:54,908 --> 01:02:56,042
Roger needs you.

1331
01:02:56,743 --> 01:02:58,678
Your silence is being noticed.

1332
01:03:00,947 --> 01:03:02,880
Well, the whole point
of an investigation

1333
01:03:02,882 --> 01:03:04,615
is to find the truth, Jeanine.

1334
01:03:04,617 --> 01:03:06,718
Until that happens,
I don't have a lot to say.

1335
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,987
If this charge sticks,

1336
01:03:08,989 --> 01:03:10,621
the working assumption
will be,

1337
01:03:10,623 --> 01:03:13,626
"Every woman at Fox got down
on her knees."

1338
01:03:14,594 --> 01:03:16,194
Even you.

1339
01:03:16,196 --> 01:03:18,196
If we sweep this thing
under the rug, Jeanine,

1340
01:03:18,198 --> 01:03:19,831
and it happens again,

1341
01:03:19,833 --> 01:03:21,333
under Title Seven,

1342
01:03:21,335 --> 01:03:22,633
Fox will be liable

1343
01:03:22,635 --> 01:03:25,069
for compensatory
and punitive damages.

1344
01:03:25,071 --> 01:03:26,738
That could be
hundreds of millions.

1345
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:29,109
Let's worry about the law
before we do the PR, okay?

1346
01:03:30,176 --> 01:03:31,976
Does Roger want us?

1347
01:03:31,978 --> 01:03:34,748
Yes. He's a man.

1348
01:03:35,715 --> 01:03:37,249
He also gave us time.

1349
01:03:37,251 --> 01:03:39,218
He gave us opportunity.

1350
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:41,222
We benefited
from that kind of attention.

1351
01:03:44,891 --> 01:03:46,624
I mean, Jeanine Pirro?

1352
01:03:46,626 --> 01:03:49,361
She's the founding member
of Team Roger.

1353
01:03:49,363 --> 01:03:50,628
You're not answering
your phone.

1354
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:51,896
No, I'm holding it.

1355
01:03:51,898 --> 01:03:53,765
Okay, well, everybody's
still looking for you.

1356
01:03:53,767 --> 01:03:57,202
- Where were any of these people to defend me from Trump, hmm?
- Excuse me.

1357
01:03:57,204 --> 01:03:58,571
Bill Shine told them not to.

1358
01:03:59,105 --> 01:04:00,671
What the fuck?

1359
01:04:00,673 --> 01:04:02,341
Our boss.

1360
01:04:02,343 --> 01:04:04,075
Why are you guys in the hall?

1361
01:04:04,077 --> 01:04:05,710
I got a call
from Roger's lawyer

1362
01:04:05,712 --> 01:04:07,879
saying to, quote, "relax."

1363
01:04:07,881 --> 01:04:09,947
They're convincing Rupert
to limit the investigation

1364
01:04:09,949 --> 01:04:11,383
to Gretchen and her team.

1365
01:04:11,385 --> 01:04:13,684
That's only five or six women.

1366
01:04:13,686 --> 01:04:15,088
Are you gonna let that happen?

1367
01:04:23,264 --> 01:04:25,763
I like Roger. I do.

1368
01:04:25,765 --> 01:04:26,731
I know.

1369
01:04:26,733 --> 01:04:29,401
Even if he can be controlling
and vindictive.

1370
01:04:29,403 --> 01:04:32,103
Those sins aren't really
the problem, Meg.

1371
01:04:32,105 --> 01:04:34,138
I mean, there were
hundreds of stories

1372
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:35,907
of Roger paying
an employee's rehab,

1373
01:04:35,909 --> 01:04:38,377
or keeping somebody
terminally ill on payroll.

1374
01:04:38,379 --> 01:04:41,079
You remember
when Shep came out.

1375
01:04:41,081 --> 01:04:42,347
All Roger said was,

1376
01:04:42,349 --> 01:04:43,449
"I don't care
where you put your pecker,

1377
01:04:43,451 --> 01:04:45,683
"as long as you don't tell me
where to put mine."

1378
01:04:45,685 --> 01:04:48,287
Again, not the most redeeming.

1379
01:04:48,289 --> 01:04:51,823
He promoted me,
he looked past the rejection,

1380
01:04:51,825 --> 01:04:54,926
he looked past the risk
of this exact conversation.

1381
01:04:54,928 --> 01:04:56,930
He handed me the power
to hurt him.

1382
01:05:26,393 --> 01:05:28,860
- Morning.
<i>- Hi, Megyn.</i>

1383
01:05:28,862 --> 01:05:31,996
We need to get
Gerson Zweifach on the phone.

1384
01:05:31,998 --> 01:05:33,998
<i>Gerson, I'm calling for Roger.</i>

1385
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
<i>He wants me to be
part of your investigation.</i>

1386
01:05:36,002 --> 01:05:37,802
We've decided
on an outside firm.

1387
01:05:37,804 --> 01:05:41,306
No, why? Gerson, we can
handle this ourselves.

1388
01:05:41,308 --> 01:05:42,940
I'm asking Paul/Weiss.

1389
01:05:42,942 --> 01:05:43,975
<i>Paul/Weiss?</i>

1390
01:05:43,977 --> 01:05:47,078
You tell them that
I can actively participate.

1391
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:50,114
Mr. Giuliani,
you're an old friend of Roger.

1392
01:05:50,116 --> 01:05:51,250
You married them.

1393
01:05:51,252 --> 01:05:53,084
<i>Sharing information with you</i>

1394
01:05:53,086 --> 01:05:55,086
<i>will remove the cloak
of attorney-client privilege,</i>

1395
01:05:55,088 --> 01:05:57,054
making the testimony
of any woman

1396
01:05:57,056 --> 01:05:59,358
who comes forward
subject to discovery.

1397
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,926
I understand.
You get me a waiver.

1398
01:06:01,928 --> 01:06:03,262
I will not structure
this investigation

1399
01:06:03,264 --> 01:06:05,997
so Roger isn't perceived of
as its target.

1400
01:06:05,999 --> 01:06:08,233
<i>You want him to look guilty?</i>

1401
01:06:08,235 --> 01:06:09,903
Well, that depends
on what we find.

1402
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:15,907
You know a reporter,
Gabe Sherman?

1403
01:06:15,909 --> 01:06:18,042
- No.
- You're about to.

1404
01:06:18,044 --> 01:06:19,244
He's found six women

1405
01:06:19,246 --> 01:06:21,112
who claim Roger Ailes
harassed them.

1406
01:06:21,114 --> 01:06:23,816
All from before Roger
founded Fox News.

1407
01:06:26,152 --> 01:06:27,752
<i>This was years ago.</i>

1408
01:06:27,754 --> 01:06:29,454
<i>He said he would
put me on the show,</i>

1409
01:06:29,456 --> 01:06:31,223
<i>but I had to go to bed
with him.</i>

1410
01:06:31,225 --> 01:06:34,426
<i>And I just said, "Yeah, right.
You and who else?"</i>

1411
01:06:34,428 --> 01:06:36,160
<i>And he said, "Just me</i>

1412
01:06:36,162 --> 01:06:38,698
<i>"and a few of
my preferred friends."</i>

1413
01:06:40,033 --> 01:06:42,934
<i>I came in
and he closed the door,</i>

1414
01:06:42,936 --> 01:06:44,269
<i>turned, and kissed me.</i>

1415
01:06:44,271 --> 01:06:46,003
<i>Like I was his girlfriend.</i>

1416
01:06:46,005 --> 01:06:47,439
<i>Like he knew it was coming.</i>

1417
01:06:47,441 --> 01:06:49,341
<i>He grabbed my tits
and he said,</i>

1418
01:06:49,343 --> 01:06:52,779
<i>"Look, no girl gets a job here
unless they're cooperative."</i>

1419
01:06:53,813 --> 01:06:55,547
<i>"If you wanna make it
in New York City</i>

1420
01:06:55,549 --> 01:06:56,948
<i>"in the TV business,</i>

1421
01:06:56,950 --> 01:06:58,350
<i>"you're gonna have to fuck me.</i>

1422
01:06:58,352 --> 01:06:59,551
<i>"And you're gonna have to
do that</i>

1423
01:06:59,553 --> 01:07:01,120
<i>"with anyone I tell you to."</i>

1424
01:07:02,121 --> 01:07:03,488
<i>He finishes the test,</i>

1425
01:07:03,490 --> 01:07:05,490
<i>which is me
pretending to cook,</i>

1426
01:07:05,492 --> 01:07:07,858
<i>then he pulls out
a garter belt and stockings</i>

1427
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:09,461
<i>and says, "Put these on."</i>

1428
01:07:09,463 --> 01:07:12,499
<i>So, yeah, well, I put them on.</i>

1429
01:07:13,567 --> 01:07:15,099
<i>And he said,</i>

1430
01:07:15,101 --> 01:07:16,501
<i>"You know,
I can really help you,</i>

1431
01:07:16,503 --> 01:07:18,470
<i>"but if you wanna play
with the big boys,</i>

1432
01:07:18,472 --> 01:07:20,805
<i>"you have to lay
with the big boys."</i>

1433
01:07:20,807 --> 01:07:22,775
<i>It was very transactional.</i>

1434
01:07:24,311 --> 01:07:27,546
<i>It was quiet.
He stared at me.</i>

1435
01:07:27,548 --> 01:07:29,914
<i>He undid his pants</i>

1436
01:07:29,916 --> 01:07:33,951
<i>and took out his penis
very gingerly.</i>

1437
01:07:33,953 --> 01:07:36,255
<i>I had never seen one.</i>

1438
01:07:36,257 --> 01:07:38,323
<i>I was scared.</i>

1439
01:07:38,325 --> 01:07:41,426
<i>Then he said, "Kiss it."</i>

1440
01:07:41,428 --> 01:07:43,029
<i>I was 16.</i>

1441
01:07:45,965 --> 01:07:47,366
<i>Former anchor
Gretchen Carlson</i>

1442
01:07:47,368 --> 01:07:49,268
<i>filing a sexual-harassment
lawsuit</i>

1443
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:51,403
<i>against Fox News
chief Roger Ailes.</i>

1444
01:07:51,405 --> 01:07:53,037
<i>More women are coming forward.</i>

1445
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:54,339
<i>Ailes is denying
the allegations</i>

1446
01:07:54,341 --> 01:07:55,873
<i>and getting
some high-profile support...</i>

1447
01:07:55,875 --> 01:07:58,042
<i>The accusations
against Roger Ailes are growing...</i>

1448
01:07:58,044 --> 01:08:00,077
<i>I have never run
a goddamn Dairy Queen.</i>

1449
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:03,215
<i>You don't get to go
and get whatever you want.</i>

1450
01:08:03,217 --> 01:08:06,385
<i>Everybody on my shows
knows the meaning of decency,</i>

1451
01:08:06,387 --> 01:08:08,620
<i>and I do mean everybody.</i>

1452
01:08:08,622 --> 01:08:12,123
A TV outfit needs tough,
confident women.

1453
01:08:12,125 --> 01:08:14,526
Do I push them?
You bet your ass I do.

1454
01:08:14,528 --> 01:08:17,995
But have I ever demanded sex
during a casting session?

1455
01:08:17,997 --> 01:08:21,032
Have I offered extra pay
for blowjobs?

1456
01:08:21,034 --> 01:08:24,636
Give me a goddamn break!
Why the hell would I do that?

1457
01:08:24,638 --> 01:08:27,472
You know the look in a woman's
eye when she's interested.

1458
01:08:27,474 --> 01:08:30,941
Walk into casting
back then as the decider.

1459
01:08:30,943 --> 01:08:33,878
There was a look
they gave.

1460
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,214
I did not always
look like this.

1461
01:08:36,216 --> 01:08:37,582
I never had to harass anybody

1462
01:08:37,584 --> 01:08:40,218
and it's fucking offensive
to say that I did!

1463
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:42,186
Well, they're trying
to change history.

1464
01:08:42,188 --> 01:08:45,392
For their families. Some of them probably
don't even remember what happened.

1465
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:48,529
That's gracious of you, Beth.

1466
01:08:51,398 --> 01:08:53,498
But this is political.

1467
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:56,967
I defy you
to find any evidence

1468
01:08:56,969 --> 01:09:00,104
that a single part of what
these women are saying is true.

1469
01:09:00,106 --> 01:09:02,274
Get ready. More will come.

1470
01:09:02,276 --> 01:09:05,042
We need to let Rupert know
what it means if I lose.

1471
01:09:05,044 --> 01:09:08,179
Gretchen Carlson
could kill Fox News.

1472
01:09:08,181 --> 01:09:10,415
This is a fight for your jobs.

1473
01:09:10,417 --> 01:09:12,217
If I go, you go!

1474
01:09:15,188 --> 01:09:18,055
If you'd asked me what type of
sexual fetish Roger Ailes had,

1475
01:09:18,057 --> 01:09:19,391
I never would have come up
with garter belts,

1476
01:09:19,393 --> 01:09:20,958
but it's fucking perfect.

1477
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,927
Their stories are so similar.

1478
01:09:22,929 --> 01:09:23,961
That doesn't prove much.

1479
01:09:23,963 --> 01:09:26,163
Sherman met them all
through Gretchen's lawyer.

1480
01:09:26,165 --> 01:09:27,166
They could have been coached.

1481
01:09:28,502 --> 01:09:30,235
The blowjob thing
feels real to me.

1482
01:09:30,237 --> 01:09:32,404
Does Roger seem like a guy
who would get off

1483
01:09:32,406 --> 01:09:34,606
on that particular
power dynamic? Yes.

1484
01:09:34,608 --> 01:09:36,208
A guy who maybe thinks

1485
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:38,643
oral doesn't
really count? Maybe.

1486
01:09:38,645 --> 01:09:40,379
A guy who has
reasons to prefer

1487
01:09:40,381 --> 01:09:42,549
a sex act that lets him
keep his clothes on?

1488
01:09:43,182 --> 01:09:44,649
Sure.

1489
01:09:44,651 --> 01:09:45,985
Still doesn't make it true.

1490
01:09:47,221 --> 01:09:48,587
Well, if true,

1491
01:09:48,589 --> 01:09:51,525
these incidents all happened
before Fox started.

1492
01:09:52,626 --> 01:09:54,393
- Should that matter?
- No.

1493
01:09:54,395 --> 01:09:55,396
Yes.

1494
01:10:02,302 --> 01:10:03,604
I talked to Gerson Zweifach.

1495
01:10:04,304 --> 01:10:05,737
And?

1496
01:10:05,739 --> 01:10:07,372
He asked me to encourage women

1497
01:10:07,374 --> 01:10:08,874
who have claims
to come forward.

1498
01:10:08,876 --> 01:10:12,178
You remember what happened last time
you got between Rupert and Roger?

1499
01:10:14,348 --> 01:10:16,548
Before I speak out,

1500
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:19,386
I need to know if this
happened to other women at Fox.

1501
01:10:21,355 --> 01:10:22,689
You understand that?

1502
01:10:25,158 --> 01:10:27,160
Is this one
where you really wanna know,

1503
01:10:28,094 --> 01:10:29,394
or you wanna look like

1504
01:10:29,396 --> 01:10:30,963
you really wanna know,
but don't?

1505
01:10:33,166 --> 01:10:34,201
I really wanna know.

1506
01:10:37,604 --> 01:10:38,705
I'm not always like that.

1507
01:10:40,441 --> 01:10:41,706
No one around here believes

1508
01:10:41,708 --> 01:10:44,008
Roger would want
to harass Gretchen.

1509
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:47,479
I will send you some of
her soapy notes to Roger.

1510
01:10:47,481 --> 01:10:49,748
"Last night
Sandra filled in for Megyn.

1511
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:51,716
"Why not me? Smiley face."

1512
01:10:51,718 --> 01:10:55,152
Who sends a harasser
a smiley face?

1513
01:10:55,154 --> 01:10:56,755
- Martin.
- Hey, Nancy.

1514
01:10:56,757 --> 01:10:58,559
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

1515
01:10:59,192 --> 01:11:01,393
Hi, Nancy. Coffee?

1516
01:11:01,395 --> 01:11:02,962
Thank you.

1517
01:11:04,765 --> 01:11:06,467
So, what do you got?

1518
01:11:08,167 --> 01:11:12,404
So, um, no one from Fox
has come forward.

1519
01:11:12,406 --> 01:11:13,772
No one?

1520
01:11:13,774 --> 01:11:15,041
Rudi Bakhtiar.

1521
01:11:17,611 --> 01:11:19,311
But no one who's still there?

1522
01:11:19,313 --> 01:11:22,046
There's been nothing
but praise for Roger.

1523
01:11:22,048 --> 01:11:24,249
Except from Megyn Kelly.

1524
01:11:24,251 --> 01:11:25,417
She's been unusually silent.

1525
01:11:25,419 --> 01:11:27,285
Right. Well,
something must've happened

1526
01:11:27,287 --> 01:11:29,221
to Megyn in the past
with Roger.

1527
01:11:29,223 --> 01:11:31,790
She's way too ambitious
not to support him.

1528
01:11:31,792 --> 01:11:33,125
Possibly.

1529
01:11:34,093 --> 01:11:35,527
Should you call?

1530
01:11:35,529 --> 01:11:38,563
Tell her this is a spotlight
you'd be happy to share?

1531
01:11:38,565 --> 01:11:40,565
Megyn, share?

1532
01:11:40,567 --> 01:11:42,534
No. She wouldn't do it.

1533
01:11:42,536 --> 01:11:44,336
- What makes you say that?
- Because I wouldn't.

1534
01:11:44,338 --> 01:11:47,405
I mean, Roger plays his women
off against each other.

1535
01:11:47,407 --> 01:11:48,707
He's always done it.
He'll say,

1536
01:11:48,709 --> 01:11:50,675
"Megyn thinks that
Lisa should get your spot."

1537
01:11:50,677 --> 01:11:53,177
Or, "Megyn suspects
that you're screwing Cal."

1538
01:11:53,179 --> 01:11:54,813
And then he'll offer advice
on how to get back at her,

1539
01:11:54,815 --> 01:11:56,046
as if you brought it up.

1540
01:11:56,048 --> 01:11:58,650
She's renegotiating her deal.
I can think of roughly

1541
01:11:58,652 --> 01:12:01,353
15 million reasons
to stay quiet.

1542
01:12:01,355 --> 01:12:03,421
We do need some collaboration.

1543
01:12:03,423 --> 01:12:04,623
Well,
that would certainly help

1544
01:12:04,625 --> 01:12:06,324
with the other networks.

1545
01:12:06,326 --> 01:12:08,160
Oh, God. What?

1546
01:12:09,229 --> 01:12:10,295
What, Marty?

1547
01:12:10,297 --> 01:12:12,664
Well, we've not had, um,

1548
01:12:12,666 --> 01:12:15,467
a lot of incoming
job interests from them.

1549
01:12:17,136 --> 01:12:18,305
What's not a lot?

1550
01:12:20,607 --> 01:12:21,608
None.

1551
01:12:22,442 --> 01:12:24,043
They're afraid of Roger.

1552
01:12:24,878 --> 01:12:26,711
No.

1553
01:12:26,713 --> 01:12:28,847
No woman gets to sue her boss.

1554
01:12:28,849 --> 01:12:30,815
Rule number one
of corporate America,

1555
01:12:30,817 --> 01:12:32,252
you don't sue your boss.

1556
01:12:34,421 --> 01:12:36,757
I jumped off a cliff.

1557
01:12:39,826 --> 01:12:42,594
I thought one of them
would stand with me.

1558
01:12:46,833 --> 01:12:48,500
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, we're home.

1559
01:12:48,502 --> 01:12:50,769
God, uh... Hey, honey.

1560
01:12:50,771 --> 01:12:52,671
There's a snack
in the kitchen.

1561
01:12:52,673 --> 01:12:53,840
- Okay.
- Thanks.

1562
01:12:59,178 --> 01:13:00,247
We're gonna get him.

1563
01:13:02,749 --> 01:13:04,649
Megyn doesn't want
to release a statement.

1564
01:13:04,651 --> 01:13:06,885
It could be seen as
influencing the investigation.

1565
01:13:06,887 --> 01:13:09,721
Have her say that
to Roger's face.

1566
01:13:09,723 --> 01:13:13,358
Look, let us know who else
hasn't spoken up for him,

1567
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:16,761
and maybe she can
encourage them, privately.

1568
01:13:16,763 --> 01:13:19,800
No! Jesus. We need
our anchors. We need her.

1569
01:13:20,567 --> 01:13:22,267
Let me talk to her.

1570
01:13:22,269 --> 01:13:23,868
Yes, please.

1571
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:28,873
Look, sweetheart. This is
an island of safety and truth.

1572
01:13:28,875 --> 01:13:30,642
I wear pants.

1573
01:13:30,644 --> 01:13:32,911
No one has ever told me
not to wear pants.

1574
01:13:32,913 --> 01:13:35,814
I wear pants. I'd love to know
where that came from.

1575
01:13:35,816 --> 01:13:37,382
It's obnoxious. It's toxic.

1576
01:13:37,384 --> 01:13:40,485
We need everyone
on Team Roger.

1577
01:13:40,487 --> 01:13:42,287
Everyone.

1578
01:13:42,289 --> 01:13:43,790
- Hi.
- Good morning.

1579
01:13:45,492 --> 01:13:49,928
Come on. No one
makes me wear short skirts.

1580
01:13:53,734 --> 01:13:55,567
He was the first
to put a female on

1581
01:13:55,569 --> 01:13:57,335
as host of a prime-time show.

1582
01:13:57,337 --> 01:13:59,404
Roger Ailes champions women.

1583
01:13:59,406 --> 01:14:02,307
No. There is no leg cam.

1584
01:14:02,309 --> 01:14:05,276
No. Could you just
hold on for one sec?

1585
01:14:05,278 --> 01:14:07,345
Maggie? I have to
wear pants tomorrow.

1586
01:14:07,347 --> 01:14:09,914
Not without authorization from
the second floor, you don't.

1587
01:14:09,916 --> 01:14:11,683
We never fitted her for pants!

1588
01:14:11,685 --> 01:14:12,917
You can print
whatever story you like,

1589
01:14:12,919 --> 01:14:13,985
but there is no leg cam.

1590
01:14:13,987 --> 01:14:15,387
- Lily?
- Hmm?

1591
01:14:15,389 --> 01:14:17,355
Beth needs me
to talk to Megyn.

1592
01:14:17,357 --> 01:14:18,757
I'm gonna do
an on-air statement

1593
01:14:18,759 --> 01:14:19,891
while all the Fox women
come out

1594
01:14:19,893 --> 01:14:21,526
one by one behind me
for Roger.

1595
01:14:21,528 --> 01:14:23,195
That will never happen.

1596
01:14:24,665 --> 01:14:25,699
Ains?

1597
01:14:32,639 --> 01:14:35,573
Well, you know why Roger's got
that door blocking his office?

1598
01:14:35,575 --> 01:14:37,876
Well, yeah, 'cause
a Bangladeshi from Accounting

1599
01:14:37,878 --> 01:14:39,577
wandered in one day
by mistake.

1600
01:14:39,579 --> 01:14:40,945
Please.

1601
01:14:40,947 --> 01:14:41,913
It's so girls can come in

1602
01:14:41,915 --> 01:14:43,583
from the back elevator
and no one sees 'em.

1603
01:14:45,252 --> 01:14:46,217
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

1604
01:14:46,219 --> 01:14:48,620
We get talent
coming here all the time

1605
01:14:48,622 --> 01:14:50,388
looking to get
their faces done.

1606
01:14:50,390 --> 01:14:52,757
"I'm going to see Roger.
I gotta look my best."

1607
01:14:52,759 --> 01:14:53,858
Yeah. One came back out

1608
01:14:53,860 --> 01:14:56,229
with it rubbed off her nose
and chin.

1609
01:14:57,497 --> 01:14:58,699
Who was that?

1610
01:15:01,735 --> 01:15:04,969
My memory's horrible.

1611
01:15:04,971 --> 01:15:06,973
You should go see Janice
in Weather.

1612
01:15:09,509 --> 01:15:11,776
I mean, nobody wants to talk.

1613
01:15:11,778 --> 01:15:14,579
- Can you blame them?
- No.

1614
01:15:14,581 --> 01:15:15,949
Where'd you disappear to?

1615
01:15:17,484 --> 01:15:19,384
I've got names.

1616
01:15:19,386 --> 01:15:21,853
Women rumored
to have stories about Roger.

1617
01:15:21,855 --> 01:15:23,488
- From who?
- Janice.

1618
01:15:23,490 --> 01:15:26,357
- Weather Janice?
- Everybody confides in her.

1619
01:15:26,359 --> 01:15:27,959
Nobody from Weather
wants your job.

1620
01:15:27,961 --> 01:15:29,027
What are you going
to do with them?

1621
01:15:29,029 --> 01:15:30,562
Tell them
this time's different.

1622
01:15:30,564 --> 01:15:31,696
- Wait.
- No, don't wait.

1623
01:15:31,698 --> 01:15:32,630
Don't listen to him.

1624
01:15:32,632 --> 01:15:35,366
Listen... Look, it's not only
your job here.

1625
01:15:35,368 --> 01:15:38,403
I got kids, okay?
Lily has a baby now.

1626
01:15:38,405 --> 01:15:41,005
Julia'll lose her visa
and have to go back to Canada.

1627
01:15:41,007 --> 01:15:44,776
And we know that you've been
talking to broadcast networks.

1628
01:15:44,778 --> 01:15:48,379
Yeah, you can get a job
anywhere. But we can't.

1629
01:15:48,381 --> 01:15:50,784
And no offense,
but who the hell will you be?

1630
01:15:51,852 --> 01:15:55,053
Nobody leaves Fox, Megyn.
Not really.

1631
01:15:55,055 --> 01:15:57,589
It's in your DNA now.

1632
01:15:57,591 --> 01:16:00,992
So, think about
what you're blowing up here.

1633
01:16:00,994 --> 01:16:02,763
I say find the truth.

1634
01:16:11,071 --> 01:16:13,538
Well, that face
tells me nothing.

1635
01:16:13,540 --> 01:16:15,940
Well, if they come after you,

1636
01:16:15,942 --> 01:16:18,411
it won't be you
they come after.

1637
01:16:26,686 --> 01:16:27,919
<i>Gretchen Carlson,</i>

1638
01:16:27,921 --> 01:16:29,454
<i>your old colleague
at Fox News,</i>

1639
01:16:29,456 --> 01:16:30,622
<i>has issued some allegations,</i>

1640
01:16:30,624 --> 01:16:32,357
<i>some sexual-harassment
allegations</i>

1641
01:16:32,359 --> 01:16:33,892
<i>over your boss, Roger Ailes.</i>

1642
01:16:33,894 --> 01:16:35,393
<i>What is your position on this?</i>

1643
01:16:35,395 --> 01:16:36,694
<i>What did you think
when you heard this?</i>

1644
01:16:36,696 --> 01:16:38,797
<i>In this country,
every famous,</i>

1645
01:16:38,799 --> 01:16:41,666
<i>powerful or wealthy person
is a target.</i>

1646
01:16:41,668 --> 01:16:43,401
<i>You're a target. I'm a target.</i>

1647
01:16:43,403 --> 01:16:46,437
<i>Any time,
somebody could come out</i>

1648
01:16:46,439 --> 01:16:48,039

1649

<i>go to the press

1650
01:16:49,643 --> 01:16:51,476
<i>And that's
a deplorable situation.</i>

1651
01:16:51,478 --> 01:16:53,678
<i>I've worked for Roger Ailes
for 20 years.</i>

1652
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:55,413
<i>Best boss I've ever had.</i>

1653
01:16:55,415 --> 01:16:57,484
Well, I've never been told
what I can't wear.

1654
01:16:58,418 --> 01:16:59,818
Well, I know you didn't ask,

1655
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:01,488
but I think
it needs to be said.

1656
01:17:03,690 --> 01:17:05,824
It's a very confusing time
right now.

1657
01:17:05,826 --> 01:17:07,592
Tonight is Manhattanhenge.

1658
01:17:07,594 --> 01:17:10,128
Sunset will align perfectly
with the city's grid.

1659
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:13,998
The best viewing streets
are 14th, 34th and 57th.

1660
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:15,867
- Good day, New York.
- And clear.

1661
01:17:15,869 --> 01:17:16,935
See you tomorrow,
Jimmy.

1662
01:17:16,937 --> 01:17:18,204
Yep. Have a good one.

1663
01:17:18,206 --> 01:17:21,873
A babe with no geezer?
This can't be a Fox affiliate.

1664
01:17:21,875 --> 01:17:24,976
Megyn. My God. How are you?

1665
01:17:24,978 --> 01:17:26,578
Good. How about you?

1666
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:28,479
Good. How's your mom?

1667
01:17:28,481 --> 01:17:30,915
She's good. She's training
to be a security guard.

1668
01:17:30,917 --> 01:17:33,084
Is that because of
the Trump stuff, or is that...

1669
01:17:33,086 --> 01:17:35,820
No. She just wants a job
where she gets to carry a gun.

1670
01:17:37,958 --> 01:17:44,562
So, did you come up here
to talk about Roger?

1671
01:17:44,564 --> 01:17:46,497
What would make you
say that?

1672
01:17:46,499 --> 01:17:47,932
I've been at local
for two years,

1673
01:17:47,934 --> 01:17:49,469
nobody's ever come to see me.

1674
01:17:50,503 --> 01:17:51,605
You miss us?

1675
01:17:52,873 --> 01:17:55,006
The network I worked at
for 14 years?

1676
01:17:55,008 --> 01:17:58,044
That my dad helped build?
Where my brother's a reporter?

1677
01:17:59,846 --> 01:18:02,146
Juliet, did Roger ever...

1678
01:18:02,148 --> 01:18:04,115
No.

1679
01:18:04,117 --> 01:18:06,553
I heard things,
but nothing firsthand.

1680
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:08,121
Good.

1681
01:18:09,223 --> 01:18:11,055
- I miss you.
- I miss you more.

1682
01:18:11,057 --> 01:18:13,560
- We should go have a drink.
- Yes.

1683
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:16,429
Um...

1684
01:18:23,503 --> 01:18:24,504
Roger...

1685
01:18:27,140 --> 01:18:31,643
He has detectives on staff.

1686
01:18:31,645 --> 01:18:33,044
Up on 14.

1687
01:18:33,046 --> 01:18:36,781
They look into enemies,
follow them,

1688
01:18:36,783 --> 01:18:38,650
post negative stories online.

1689
01:18:38,652 --> 01:18:40,018
It's called the Black Room.

1690
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:41,586
I don't want you
in danger, all right?

1691
01:18:41,588 --> 01:18:43,757
No, no, no.
I'm not talking about me.

1692
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:47,060
I'm talking about you.

1693
01:18:49,129 --> 01:18:52,098
Be careful who you ask
questions about Roger Ailes.

1694
01:18:58,104 --> 01:19:00,207
My lawyers
are negotiating with Fox.

1695
01:19:03,176 --> 01:19:05,011
Not that Bill will pay
any of it.

1696
01:19:05,645 --> 01:19:06,778
Bill?

1697
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:07,948
O'Reilly.

1698
01:19:09,283 --> 01:19:10,684
And Jack.

1699
01:19:12,953 --> 01:19:14,619
Jesus.

1700
01:19:16,189 --> 01:19:17,190
Sorry.

1701
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:21,228
Fish rots from the head.

1702
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,200
I'm gonna talk
to the outside firm

1703
01:19:28,202 --> 01:19:30,204
investigating this,
Paul/Weiss.

1704
01:19:31,604 --> 01:19:34,138
I heard you had
some issues over here.

1705
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:35,673
I did.

1706
01:19:35,675 --> 01:19:37,143
If you have a name to give.

1707
01:19:38,611 --> 01:19:40,578
Roger.

1708
01:19:40,580 --> 01:19:42,680
I wouldn't ask
if I didn't think it was safe.

1709
01:19:48,822 --> 01:19:49,787
Roger.

1710
01:19:49,789 --> 01:19:52,924
<i>Jack. Roger. Roger.</i>

1711
01:19:52,926 --> 01:19:54,625
<i>Doug. Roger. Jack.</i>

1712
01:19:54,627 --> 01:19:56,261
<i>Roger. Francisco. Doug.
Bill. Jack.</i>

1713
01:19:56,263 --> 01:19:58,665
<i>Jack. Francisco. Bill.
Roger. Roger.</i>

1714
01:20:03,970 --> 01:20:05,605
It's Kayla, right?

1715
01:20:06,139 --> 01:20:07,140
Yeah.

1716
01:20:08,141 --> 01:20:09,776
- Hi.
- Hi.

1717
01:20:10,244 --> 01:20:11,343
Megyn.

1718
01:20:11,345 --> 01:20:12,846
I know.

1719
01:20:14,147 --> 01:20:16,814
You used to work
with Gretchen, right?

1720
01:20:16,816 --> 01:20:18,049
Mmm-hmm.

1721
01:20:18,051 --> 01:20:19,318
Did you learn a lot from her?

1722
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:21,185
I did, yes.

1723
01:20:21,187 --> 01:20:23,955
I have nothing but
good things to say about her.

1724
01:20:23,957 --> 01:20:25,990
That's great.

1725
01:20:25,992 --> 01:20:27,925
You know, I always find it
so interesting

1726
01:20:27,927 --> 01:20:29,060
who history chooses

1727
01:20:29,062 --> 01:20:31,131
- to do something important.
- Mmm.

1728
01:20:33,166 --> 01:20:34,999
I guess.

1729
01:20:35,001 --> 01:20:36,736
Listen, I wanted to ask you...

1730
01:20:40,307 --> 01:20:42,842
I wanted to ask you
if Roger is harassing you.

1731
01:20:51,184 --> 01:20:52,585
How did you know?

1732
01:20:56,189 --> 01:20:57,724
We find each other.

1733
01:21:01,094 --> 01:21:02,095
You, too?

1734
01:21:03,230 --> 01:21:04,631
Long time ago.

1735
01:21:07,634 --> 01:21:09,636
Wow.

1736
01:21:17,677 --> 01:21:18,845
You okay?

1737
01:21:19,979 --> 01:21:21,114
Mmm-hmm.

1738
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:28,855
You should report Roger.

1739
01:21:29,789 --> 01:21:31,024
You'll be protected.

1740
01:21:31,658 --> 01:21:32,659
Did you?

1741
01:21:33,394 --> 01:21:35,095
I took it to his superior.

1742
01:21:37,964 --> 01:21:40,965
Nothing happened.
I had to drop it.

1743
01:21:40,967 --> 01:21:41,968
Why?

1744
01:21:44,405 --> 01:21:46,072
I wanted to be on television.

1745
01:21:48,741 --> 01:21:50,743
Did you think
what your silence would mean?

1746
01:21:51,945 --> 01:21:54,979
For us? The rest of us?

1747
01:21:54,981 --> 01:21:57,249
Roger is not my fault.

1748
01:21:57,251 --> 01:22:00,452
It would've been nice if...

1749
01:22:00,454 --> 01:22:04,657
If somebody told us that
he's after more than legs.

1750
01:22:06,192 --> 01:22:08,826
It's nobody's job
to protect you, Kayla.

1751
01:22:08,828 --> 01:22:10,663
That's all of our job.

1752
01:22:12,799 --> 01:22:15,032
I don't get you. You're...

1753
01:22:15,034 --> 01:22:16,701
You have power.

1754
01:22:16,703 --> 01:22:18,836
Why are you still playing
by old rules?

1755
01:22:18,838 --> 01:22:20,241
You're Megyn Kelly.

1756
01:22:21,107 --> 01:22:22,909
Look around, snowflake.

1757
01:22:23,877 --> 01:22:25,843
How do you think I succeeded?

1758
01:22:25,845 --> 01:22:28,681
How do you think a woman
gets a prime-time Fox show?

1759
01:22:32,051 --> 01:22:34,085
So, you had sex with him?

1760
01:22:34,087 --> 01:22:36,122
Jesus fucking Christ.

1761
01:22:41,794 --> 01:22:42,994
<i>One thing to keep in mind</i>

1762
01:22:42,996 --> 01:22:45,730
<i>about the prospect of Indiana
governor, Mike Pence,</i>

1763
01:22:45,732 --> 01:22:47,798
<i>becoming Donald Trump's
running mate...</i>

1764
01:22:53,873 --> 01:22:54,874
Hello.

1765
01:22:56,009 --> 01:22:57,808
Hey, it's me.

1766
01:22:57,810 --> 01:23:01,145
Oh, my God.
What the fuck? Kayla.

1767
01:23:01,147 --> 01:23:04,249
<i>It said "Bill" in my phone.
What the fuck?</i>

1768
01:23:04,251 --> 01:23:07,919
Oh, sorry. I saved my number
under his name

1769
01:23:07,921 --> 01:23:10,188
in your phone, um, as a joke.

1770
01:23:10,190 --> 01:23:12,990
- <i>I forgot.</i>
- Oh, my God. Jesus Christ.

1771
01:23:12,992 --> 01:23:14,892
I had a heart attack.

1772
01:23:14,894 --> 01:23:17,828
<i>Where are you?</i>

1773
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:18,963
Um...

1774
01:23:18,965 --> 01:23:21,468
- I'm on a date.
- <i>Oh.</i>

1775
01:23:22,503 --> 01:23:24,001
Okay.

1776
01:23:24,003 --> 01:23:25,004
<i>Hey. Did you, um...</i>

1777
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:30,775
Did you give my name
to Megyn by any chance?

1778
01:23:30,777 --> 01:23:35,046
I... I may have, um,

1779
01:23:35,048 --> 01:23:38,816
worried about you out loud
once or twice.

1780
01:23:38,818 --> 01:23:40,086
Why didn't you just

1781
01:23:41,455 --> 01:23:42,521
support me?

1782
01:23:42,523 --> 01:23:44,289
<i>I don't... I don't even know.</i>

1783
01:23:44,291 --> 01:23:47,695
I couldn't
do anything. And I...

1784
01:23:49,230 --> 01:23:53,199
I can't fuck up because
I'm a lesbian at Fox News.

1785
01:23:55,001 --> 01:23:56,067
So?

1786
01:23:56,069 --> 01:24:00,372
So, who's your date with, Kayla?

1787
01:24:00,374 --> 01:24:02,407
<i>I can't just go
on a date with a dude</i>

1788
01:24:02,409 --> 01:24:05,379
<i>and make it go away, you know?</i>

1789
01:24:14,153 --> 01:24:15,788
I think I'm...

1790
01:24:17,258 --> 01:24:19,226
I think I'm gonna
call Paul/Weiss.

1791
01:24:20,227 --> 01:24:22,960
Okay. That's good.

1792
01:24:22,962 --> 01:24:24,095
<i>That's really good.</i>

1793
01:24:24,097 --> 01:24:26,431
<i>I'm really glad
you're doing that.</i>

1794
01:24:26,433 --> 01:24:29,401
<i>I think that's absolutely
what you should do.</i>

1795
01:24:29,403 --> 01:24:30,537
Okay, great.

1796
01:24:31,871 --> 01:24:34,038
<i>I just, um... I just...</i>

1797
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:35,940
I didn't...

1798
01:24:35,942 --> 01:24:37,875
I can't call anyone else
and I just...

1799
01:24:37,877 --> 01:24:39,977
I need someone right now

1800
01:24:39,979 --> 01:24:43,147
to tell me
that that's what I should do.

1801
01:24:43,149 --> 01:24:44,316
<i>Oh, my God, yes.</i>

1802
01:24:44,318 --> 01:24:45,950
I heard it was, like,
an outside firm

1803
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:47,887
and they're taking it
really seriously.

1804
01:24:48,955 --> 01:24:51,090
Okay, great. Thanks.

1805
01:24:54,228 --> 01:24:55,396
Kayla.

1806
01:24:57,364 --> 01:24:58,965
<i>What happened?</i>

1807
01:25:02,068 --> 01:25:03,337
I did it.

1808
01:25:04,338 --> 01:25:05,972
I...

1809
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:09,142
I did it. I gave in to him.

1810
01:25:13,314 --> 01:25:14,847
<i>Kayla, I...</i>

1811
01:25:16,517 --> 01:25:18,051
I'm so sorry.

1812
01:25:19,553 --> 01:25:22,119
He kept talking.
He just kept talking.

1813
01:25:22,121 --> 01:25:23,490
He kept saying...

1814
01:25:24,924 --> 01:25:26,957
"Good girl.

1815
01:25:26,959 --> 01:25:29,128
"That's a good girl.
Be a good soldier.

1816
01:25:31,964 --> 01:25:33,565
"Earn your place."

1817
01:25:33,567 --> 01:25:35,066
Fuck.

1818
01:25:35,068 --> 01:25:37,369
<i>He didn't even...</i>

1819
01:25:37,371 --> 01:25:38,605
Didn't even unbuckle.

1820
01:25:39,606 --> 01:25:41,506
He couldn't get...

1821
01:25:52,353 --> 01:25:54,453
I feel so filthy.

1822
01:25:54,455 --> 01:25:56,221
<i>No, Kayla.</i>

1823
01:25:56,223 --> 01:25:58,258
You didn't do anything wrong.

1824
01:26:01,428 --> 01:26:02,596
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1825
01:26:06,266 --> 01:26:07,534
I better go.

1826
01:26:09,636 --> 01:26:12,437
Roger can sense
vulnerabilities.

1827
01:26:12,439 --> 01:26:15,940
In those days, our meetings
were career-strategy sessions

1828
01:26:15,942 --> 01:26:19,511
mixed with good advice
and comments like...

1829
01:26:19,513 --> 01:26:23,180
The most basic thing
is confidence.

1830
01:26:23,182 --> 01:26:25,450
Feel at home in your own skin.

1831
01:26:25,452 --> 01:26:27,985
If you're confident,
you're sexy.

1832
01:26:27,987 --> 01:26:30,355
I'm sure you have
some sexy bras.

1833
01:26:30,357 --> 01:26:33,159
I'd love to see you in those.

1834
01:26:35,529 --> 01:26:37,729
It was a cat-and-mouse game.

1835
01:26:37,731 --> 01:26:40,097
But he always gave me
good advice,

1836
01:26:40,099 --> 01:26:41,402
and let me deflect,

1837
01:26:43,370 --> 01:26:44,904
tell him to dream on.

1838
01:26:47,274 --> 01:26:49,142
The more I let him
get away with,

1839
01:26:51,311 --> 01:26:53,545
the more he pushed my buttons.

1840
01:26:53,547 --> 01:26:57,215
<i>I don't know if women
can be good interviewers.</i>

1841
01:26:57,217 --> 01:27:00,421
Men have that killer instinct.

1842
01:27:01,688 --> 01:27:04,121
We do bad things.

1843
01:27:04,123 --> 01:27:06,058
And we do not
feel guilty about it.

1844
01:27:08,395 --> 01:27:12,198
How can I be sure
you have that kind of drive?

1845
01:27:16,537 --> 01:27:18,470
Finally, in January...

1846
01:27:18,472 --> 01:27:19,671
This is '06?

1847
01:27:19,673 --> 01:27:20,940
Yes.

1848
01:27:46,767 --> 01:27:48,235
He grabbed me.

1849
01:27:50,704 --> 01:27:52,138
Tried to kiss me.

1850
01:28:00,514 --> 01:28:02,483
I pushed him away twice.

1851
01:28:07,387 --> 01:28:11,458
<i>As I was leaving, he asked,
"When's your contract up?"</i>

1852
01:28:28,509 --> 01:28:30,575
After the third time, I left.

1853
01:28:30,577 --> 01:28:33,545
And he never tried
anything again?

1854
01:28:33,547 --> 01:28:34,748
No.

1855
01:28:35,849 --> 01:28:38,318
I ignored his calls.
Stayed in DC.

1856
01:28:39,018 --> 01:28:40,554
Two years later, I had a show.

1857
01:28:41,788 --> 01:28:44,856
Any long-term consequences?

1858
01:28:49,095 --> 01:28:50,330
Yeah. Um...

1859
01:28:58,705 --> 01:29:00,872
Am I Witness W?

1860
01:29:00,874 --> 01:29:03,243
Yes. Why?

1861
01:29:04,344 --> 01:29:06,313
It's the 23rd letter
in the alphabet.

1862
01:29:07,381 --> 01:29:09,179
Have 22 other women
come forward

1863
01:29:09,181 --> 01:29:10,717
since I first spoke to you?

1864
01:29:12,486 --> 01:29:13,487
Have they?

1865
01:29:17,758 --> 01:29:19,125
Will there be more?

1866
01:29:28,835 --> 01:29:30,702
<i>A major bombshell
this morning.</i>

1867
01:29:30,704 --> 01:29:33,605
<i>Star anchor Megyn Kelly
has informed lawyers</i>

1868
01:29:33,607 --> 01:29:35,507
<i>that Fox News CEO,
Roger Ailes,</i>

1869
01:29:35,509 --> 01:29:37,242
<i>sexually harassed her.</i>

1870
01:29:37,244 --> 01:29:38,610
<i>For her to level
these allegations</i>

1871
01:29:38,612 --> 01:29:40,144
<i>is devastating against Ailes.</i>

1872
01:29:40,146 --> 01:29:42,514
<i>We are seeing
the end of an era at Fox News.</i>

1873
01:29:42,516 --> 01:29:44,349
<i>The dagger in his heart,
in some ways,</i>

1874
01:29:44,351 --> 01:29:45,917
<i>was the notion
that Megyn Kelly</i>

1875
01:29:45,919 --> 01:29:47,919
<i>was among his accusers.</i>

1876
01:29:47,921 --> 01:29:49,621
What?

1877
01:29:49,623 --> 01:29:52,189
What?

1878
01:29:52,191 --> 01:29:53,827
Yes. Yes.

1879
01:30:03,537 --> 01:30:05,503
Roger, what's the matter?

1880
01:30:05,505 --> 01:30:06,771
Megyn's claiming
I harassed her.

1881
01:30:06,773 --> 01:30:08,506
- What?
- You saw Gabe Sherman's post?

1882
01:30:08,508 --> 01:30:10,542
James has been
feeding him bullshit.

1883
01:30:10,544 --> 01:30:11,676
Comb through Megyn's press.

1884
01:30:11,678 --> 01:30:14,379
Find every single positive
thing she's said about me

1885
01:30:14,381 --> 01:30:15,714
and get it out, now.

1886
01:30:15,716 --> 01:30:19,151
Roger, I can't discredit
an anchor I'm paid to promote.

1887
01:30:21,321 --> 01:30:23,755
Glad I'm not in a foxhole
with you.

1888
01:30:23,757 --> 01:30:26,791
Well, we'll leak something
to Breitbart or to Drudge.

1889
01:30:26,793 --> 01:30:28,192
I'm sorry, Roger.

1890
01:30:28,194 --> 01:30:29,861
Well, do something!

1891
01:30:29,863 --> 01:30:32,297
At least get some shit
about Gretchen out there.

1892
01:30:32,299 --> 01:30:34,201
These women
are trying to fuck me!

1893
01:30:38,372 --> 01:30:40,372
I have no answers for you
that you don't already know.

1894
01:30:40,374 --> 01:30:41,840
It's out of my hands
at this point.

1895
01:30:41,842 --> 01:30:44,542
We will be emailing you guys.
Please just hold tight.

1896
01:30:47,347 --> 01:30:48,348
Thanks.

1897
01:30:48,782 --> 01:30:49,948
Hey, Gil.

1898
01:30:49,950 --> 01:30:51,316
Hey, Greta.

1899
01:30:51,318 --> 01:30:53,451
What's Megyn's endgame?

1900
01:30:53,453 --> 01:30:55,654
This part of her
contract negotiation?

1901
01:30:55,656 --> 01:30:57,322
It's not economic.

1902
01:30:57,324 --> 01:30:58,790
Or political.

1903
01:30:58,792 --> 01:30:59,793
Okay, Gil.

1904
01:31:03,964 --> 01:31:05,397
No, this is scaring me.

1905
01:31:05,399 --> 01:31:06,698
It's like
the whole world's on fire

1906
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:08,633
- and no one can be trusted.
- Hey, Geraldo.

1907
01:31:08,635 --> 01:31:10,535
- CNN, line six.
- Can't talk.

1908
01:31:10,537 --> 01:31:12,270
These are the end-times.

1909
01:31:12,272 --> 01:31:13,338
Why aren't you on the phone?

1910
01:31:13,340 --> 01:31:14,839
To comment
on sexual harassment?

1911
01:31:14,841 --> 01:31:16,541
We work for Bill.

1912
01:31:16,543 --> 01:31:17,709
Team Roger.

1913
01:31:17,711 --> 01:31:19,310
Hey, we need you to wear it.

1914
01:31:19,312 --> 01:31:20,512
- No.
- Are you kidding?

1915
01:31:20,514 --> 01:31:21,680
- No.
- Are you kidding?

1916
01:31:21,682 --> 01:31:22,947
- Doesn't she have a job?
- Get it on.

1917
01:31:22,949 --> 01:31:24,449
Megyn Kelly has no comment.

1918
01:31:24,451 --> 01:31:25,585
She's traveling.

1919
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:27,786
To Cleveland.

1920
01:31:27,788 --> 01:31:30,422
For the Republican convention,
remember?

1921
01:31:30,424 --> 01:31:32,323
Look, I've known him
for 40 years,

1922
01:31:32,325 --> 01:31:34,726
and he's about as flirty as
the grizzly from <i>The Revenant.</i>

1923
01:31:34,728 --> 01:31:35,894
Let me
tell you something.

1924
01:31:35,896 --> 01:31:38,730
I called these allegations
sick 'cause they are sick.

1925
01:31:38,732 --> 01:31:41,299
Hey, why wasn't I let in
on the pact?

1926
01:31:41,301 --> 01:31:42,367
What pact?

1927
01:31:42,369 --> 01:31:43,835
Breitbart is saying
there's a pact

1928
01:31:43,837 --> 01:31:45,837
among our
top 50 on-air talents

1929
01:31:45,839 --> 01:31:47,272
that if Roger gets fired,
we all walk.

1930
01:31:47,274 --> 01:31:48,440
Great. Where do I sign?

1931
01:31:48,442 --> 01:31:49,708
Wait, I never heard of a pact.

1932
01:31:49,710 --> 01:31:50,711
Me either.

1933
01:31:53,346 --> 01:31:54,514
Roger placed it.

1934
01:31:55,982 --> 01:31:57,515
Fake news.

1935
01:31:57,517 --> 01:31:58,583
Come on.

1936
01:31:58,585 --> 01:32:00,487
<i>How bad
does it look for Roger?</i>

1937
01:32:01,288 --> 01:32:02,954
<i>Bad.</i>

1938
01:32:02,956 --> 01:32:05,957
Doesn't feel
like I imagined it would.

1939
01:32:05,959 --> 01:32:08,962
<i>Gretchen, you achieved
something remarkable.</i>

1940
01:32:10,964 --> 01:32:12,532
Yes, I did.

1941
01:32:14,968 --> 01:32:16,002
Mom?

1942
01:32:17,437 --> 01:32:19,804
I think it's time
we finish this.

1943
01:32:19,806 --> 01:32:21,708
<i>Okay. I'll let you know.</i>

1944
01:32:25,312 --> 01:32:26,646
Mom, are you done with that?

1945
01:32:27,681 --> 01:32:29,282
Mmm-hmm. I'm done.

1946
01:32:31,551 --> 01:32:32,884
I made the Murdochs

1947
01:32:32,886 --> 01:32:35,620
1.5 billion in profit
last year.

1948
01:32:35,622 --> 01:32:36,688
Pure profit.

1949
01:32:36,690 --> 01:32:38,656
Fox News
is the most successful

1950
01:32:38,658 --> 01:32:41,561
cable franchise in history.

1951
01:32:42,696 --> 01:32:44,297
Gretchen Carlson's lawyers.

1952
01:32:45,766 --> 01:32:48,099
She wants to settle.

1953
01:32:48,101 --> 01:32:50,602
It's a lot less appealing
to sue you personally

1954
01:32:50,604 --> 01:32:52,539
without Rupert's money
behind you.

1955
01:32:56,576 --> 01:32:57,577
Hey, Ken.

1956
01:33:00,981 --> 01:33:01,982
Ken.

1957
01:33:28,108 --> 01:33:31,009
- Hey! Look who's here.
- Oh, my gosh!

1958
01:33:31,011 --> 01:33:33,411
- I brought you some small people.
- Yard! Yatesy!

1959
01:33:33,413 --> 01:33:34,946
Oh, my gosh.
I've missed you guys so much.

1960
01:33:34,948 --> 01:33:36,815
We practiced that scare
for two weeks.

1961
01:33:36,817 --> 01:33:38,016
Look at you.

1962
01:33:38,018 --> 01:33:39,651
- Hi.
- Hi.

1963
01:33:39,653 --> 01:33:42,887
- I love you, Mama.
- My little chubble-wubbles.

1964
01:33:42,889 --> 01:33:44,923
- We got her.
- All right.

1965
01:33:44,925 --> 01:33:46,825
She was so scared.

1966
01:33:46,827 --> 01:33:48,159
Thank you.

1967
01:33:48,161 --> 01:33:50,161
How are you, sweetheart?

1968
01:33:50,163 --> 01:33:52,063
I'm either damned for doing it

1969
01:33:52,065 --> 01:33:53,466
or damned
for not doing it sooner.

1970
01:33:55,702 --> 01:33:58,004
Tell me my big mouth
didn't ruin our life.

1971
01:33:58,805 --> 01:33:59,806
Not yet.

1972
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:08,748
Can I speak
to Roger alone, please?

1973
01:34:17,424 --> 01:34:18,758
Are you sure
you want Beth here?

1974
01:34:19,793 --> 01:34:21,361
Well, of course.

1975
01:34:27,801 --> 01:34:30,136
Gretchen taped
your conversations.

1976
01:34:31,938 --> 01:34:33,504
That's a goddamn lie.

1977
01:34:33,506 --> 01:34:34,808
For over a year.

1978
01:34:37,978 --> 01:34:39,079
But...

1979
01:34:39,980 --> 01:34:41,713
you don't believe her?

1980
01:34:41,715 --> 01:34:44,684
Your quotes in her lawsuit,
they're from tapes.

1981
01:34:48,755 --> 01:34:50,521
Why didn't they
tell us before?

1982
01:34:50,523 --> 01:34:52,559
So you'd issue
complete denials.

1983
01:34:54,694 --> 01:34:56,429
So you'd have no credibility.

1984
01:35:03,069 --> 01:35:05,005
Apparently,
she did her homework.

1985
01:35:22,055 --> 01:35:25,023
<i>God bless our
next President, Donald Trump,</i>

1986
01:35:25,025 --> 01:35:29,195
<i>and God bless
the United States of America!</i>

1987
01:35:30,163 --> 01:35:31,831
<i>USA!</i>

1988
01:35:32,799 --> 01:35:34,933
Mr. Giuliani's fired up.

1989
01:35:34,935 --> 01:35:36,968
When we come back,
we'll discuss his speech

1990
01:35:36,970 --> 01:35:38,970
with the man
who helped write it.

1991
01:35:38,972 --> 01:35:40,505
Clear.

1992
01:35:40,507 --> 01:35:42,140
<i>Don't react, okay?</i>

1993
01:35:42,142 --> 01:35:43,208
Mmm-hmm.

1994
01:35:43,210 --> 01:35:44,544
<i>Roger's out.</i>

1995
01:35:47,981 --> 01:35:49,281
Is that sourced, Gil?

1996
01:35:49,283 --> 01:35:51,283
<i>Yeah. The</i> New York Post.

1997
01:35:51,285 --> 01:35:53,151
<i>They put him on the cover.</i>

1998
01:35:53,153 --> 01:35:54,854
<i>Rupert's telling him
to let go.</i>

1999
01:35:55,889 --> 01:35:57,021
Then it's a scoop.

2000
01:35:57,023 --> 01:35:59,057
<i>We're gonna win.
We're gonna win so big.</i>

2001
01:35:59,059 --> 01:36:00,925
<i>Thank you very much,
everybody.</i>

2002
01:36:00,927 --> 01:36:02,261
There is some
breaking news tonight

2003
01:36:02,263 --> 01:36:03,995
in the worlds of
media and politics.

2004
01:36:03,997 --> 01:36:05,797
A blockbuster shakeup
at Fox News.

2005
01:36:05,799 --> 01:36:07,232
A dramatic fall from grace.

2006
01:36:07,234 --> 01:36:10,235
Roger Ailes is out
as top boss.

2007
01:36:10,237 --> 01:36:11,970
They want us
to circle the block.

2008
01:36:11,972 --> 01:36:13,173
No. Hold on.

2009
01:36:16,676 --> 01:36:18,545
- What's going on?
- Go around.

2010
01:36:21,614 --> 01:36:22,949
I've been shut out.

2011
01:36:31,658 --> 01:36:32,523
<i>It's true.</i>

2012
01:36:32,525 --> 01:36:34,993
Everything Gretchen said,
it's all true.

2013
01:36:34,995 --> 01:36:36,127
Roger lied to me.

2014
01:36:36,129 --> 01:36:38,663
Why?
Because I'm a manager here,

2015
01:36:38,665 --> 01:36:40,832
so I have concerns
my public defense of Roger

2016
01:36:40,834 --> 01:36:42,633
could be construed
as coercive.

2017
01:36:42,635 --> 01:36:44,704
Hey. Huh. Pants.

2018
01:36:45,171 --> 01:36:46,240
Fuck off, Neil.

2019
01:36:59,919 --> 01:37:01,286
Sorry to keep you waiting.

2020
01:37:01,288 --> 01:37:02,954
No, no, no, no, no, sit down.

2021
01:37:02,956 --> 01:37:05,191
Appreciate you
driving up here, Roger.

2022
01:37:06,126 --> 01:37:07,961
- Susan Estrich.
- Susan.

2023
01:37:10,997 --> 01:37:13,365
I hate that it's come to this.

2024
01:37:13,367 --> 01:37:14,868
Me, too.

2025
01:37:25,279 --> 01:37:29,248
We gave these women jobs.

2026
01:37:29,250 --> 01:37:32,217
Put them on the air,
made them famous.

2027
01:37:32,219 --> 01:37:34,118
Do you think
for a goddamn second

2028
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:36,556
I did any damage
to any of them?

2029
01:37:37,657 --> 01:37:39,092
No, you don't.

2030
01:37:41,761 --> 01:37:42,962
You don't, Rupert.

2031
01:37:44,998 --> 01:37:47,867
There's no audience
for that side of the story.

2032
01:37:58,379 --> 01:37:59,545
To begin with,

2033
01:37:59,547 --> 01:38:02,347
half this, you already owe him
from last year's bonus.

2034
01:38:02,349 --> 01:38:04,216
And we're paying it.

2035
01:38:04,218 --> 01:38:05,950
And paying off your contract.

2036
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:07,219
Consider yourself lucky.

2037
01:38:07,221 --> 01:38:10,655
It's a contractual obligation.

2038
01:38:10,657 --> 01:38:14,826
I created the Murdoch family's
most profitable asset.

2039
01:38:14,828 --> 01:38:17,229
A third of your margin.

2040
01:38:17,231 --> 01:38:19,364
There are three of you.

2041
01:38:19,366 --> 01:38:21,233
I guess that means
I pay for the food

2042
01:38:21,235 --> 01:38:23,036
that one of you puts
in your mouth.

2043
01:38:24,671 --> 01:38:25,903
What if it's you?

2044
01:38:25,905 --> 01:38:27,672
I'd have fired you for cause.

2045
01:38:27,674 --> 01:38:29,040
Roger,

2046
01:38:29,042 --> 01:38:31,709
you built an amazing business.

2047
01:38:31,711 --> 01:38:33,613
No one can take that
away from you.

2048
01:38:34,681 --> 01:38:37,384
But under the circumstances,

2049
01:38:38,685 --> 01:38:41,253
this is a lot of money.

2050
01:38:41,255 --> 01:38:42,920
And it won't look good
to the people

2051
01:38:42,922 --> 01:38:44,389
that don't know your worth.

2052
01:38:44,391 --> 01:38:46,090
Take it.

2053
01:38:46,092 --> 01:38:47,961
Honor your non-compete.

2054
01:38:55,369 --> 01:38:57,170
I never cared about the money.

2055
01:38:58,305 --> 01:38:59,772
We know, Roger.

2056
01:39:06,980 --> 01:39:08,014
Okay.

2057
01:39:09,849 --> 01:39:12,750
Okay.

2058
01:39:12,752 --> 01:39:15,254
I'd like to go
to the newsroom with you.

2059
01:39:15,256 --> 01:39:18,091
I'd like us to announce
my leaving together.

2060
01:39:24,097 --> 01:39:25,098
No.

2061
01:39:37,143 --> 01:39:39,712
The end of the leg man.

2062
01:39:41,315 --> 01:39:43,049
I won't miss him.

2063
01:39:43,950 --> 01:39:44,984
Boys.

2064
01:39:54,027 --> 01:39:56,029
Hope you two know
what you're doing.

2065
01:40:00,467 --> 01:40:04,168
Once Roger's office is cleared
of handguns, I'll move in.

2066
01:40:04,170 --> 01:40:06,837
I'll run the network
till the ship's aright.

2067
01:40:10,211 --> 01:40:12,311
Donald.

2068
01:40:12,313 --> 01:40:14,346
How's our speech coming?

2069
01:40:14,348 --> 01:40:16,250
Yeah.

2070
01:40:18,385 --> 01:40:21,253
<i>Megyn's gotta go! Ho, ho, ho!</i>

2071
01:40:21,255 --> 01:40:25,557
<i>Megyn's gotta go! Ho, ho, ho!</i>

2072
01:40:25,559 --> 01:40:27,058
Convention's
downstairs, folks.

2073
01:40:27,060 --> 01:40:28,159
What's going on at Fox?

2074
01:40:28,161 --> 01:40:29,060
Would you say
people are shocked?

2075
01:40:29,062 --> 01:40:30,861
Can Rupert
afford to dump Roger?

2076
01:40:30,863 --> 01:40:32,863
What did he do to you?
Megyn. Come on!

2077
01:40:32,865 --> 01:40:34,533
<i>Of all the ways
this could end,</i>

2078
01:40:34,535 --> 01:40:35,868
<i>I didn't see this one coming.</i>

2079
01:40:37,204 --> 01:40:38,936
<i>Gretchen Carlson
got the Murdochs</i>

2080
01:40:38,938 --> 01:40:40,805
<i>to put the rights of women
above profit,</i>

2081
01:40:40,807 --> 01:40:43,475
<i>if only temporarily.</i>

2082
01:40:43,477 --> 01:40:46,445
<i>And I found myself
with a job I didn't want</i>

2083
01:40:46,447 --> 01:40:48,315
<i>or couldn't really leave</i>

2084
01:40:49,182 --> 01:40:50,915
<i>even when I did.</i>

2085
01:40:59,058 --> 01:41:01,125
You should keep that out.

2086
01:41:01,127 --> 01:41:03,094
People, can I get
your attention, please?

2087
01:41:03,096 --> 01:41:05,230
Mr. Murdoch
is joining us today.

2088
01:41:05,232 --> 01:41:07,201
He has a very important
statement he'd like to say.

2089
01:41:08,602 --> 01:41:10,502
Excuse me, everyone.

2090
01:41:10,504 --> 01:41:12,437
I won't take long.

2091
01:41:12,439 --> 01:41:15,540
Roger Ailes is leaving Fox.

2092
01:41:15,542 --> 01:41:18,377
Now, I want to start
by thanking Roger

2093
01:41:18,379 --> 01:41:20,878
for his
remarkable contribution

2094
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:23,448
to our company
and to our country.

2095
01:41:23,450 --> 01:41:26,418
Twenty years ago,
Roger shared...

2096
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:27,586
<i>Here's the thing about</i>

2097
01:41:27,588 --> 01:41:30,855
<i>being sexually harassed
at work.</i>

2098
01:41:30,857 --> 01:41:32,293
<i>It condemns you to questions.</i>

2099
01:41:34,927 --> 01:41:36,363
<i>You keep asking yourself,</i>

2100
01:41:37,398 --> 01:41:38,865
<i>"What did I do?</i>

2101
01:41:39,433 --> 01:41:40,833
<i>"What did I say?</i>

2102
01:41:41,502 --> 01:41:43,268
<i>"What did I wear?</i>

2103
01:41:43,270 --> 01:41:44,438
<i>"What did I miss?</i>

2104
01:41:45,439 --> 01:41:47,106
<i>"Am I seen as weak?</i>

2105
01:41:49,876 --> 01:41:51,811
<i>"Will they say
I'm after money?</i>

2106
01:41:53,614 --> 01:41:55,882
<i>"Will they say
I'm after attention?</i>

2107
01:41:58,184 --> 01:41:59,520
<i>"Will I be left out?</i>

2108
01:42:02,389 --> 01:42:05,590
<i>"Will I be defined by this
for the rest of my life?"</i>

2109
01:42:05,592 --> 01:42:09,193
I will take over
as Chairman and acting CEO

2110
01:42:09,195 --> 01:42:12,331
with the support of our
existing management team,

2111
01:42:12,333 --> 01:42:14,133
under Bill Shine.

2112
01:42:16,035 --> 01:42:19,005
<i>If I stay, do I just
have to put up with it?</i>

2113
01:42:26,246 --> 01:42:28,114
<i>Will the next place
be different?</i>

2114
01:42:30,684 --> 01:42:32,952
<i>Or can I make it different?</i>

2115
01:42:46,165 --> 01:42:47,199
<i>Roger always said,</i>

2116
01:42:47,201 --> 01:42:50,069
<i>"Everyone on television
only has one real job.</i>

2117
01:42:51,205 --> 01:42:52,473
<i>"To be likable."</i>

2118
01:42:53,973 --> 01:42:56,208
<i>Well, I don't care
if you like me,</i>

2119
01:42:56,210 --> 01:42:57,977
<i>only that you believe me.</i>

2120
01:42:59,546 --> 01:43:01,613
<i>A lot of people, even women,</i>

2121
01:43:01,615 --> 01:43:03,615
<i>are skeptical
of harassment claims</i>

2122
01:43:03,617 --> 01:43:06,083
<i>until they experience it
themselves,</i>

2123
01:43:06,085 --> 01:43:07,985
<i>or know someone who has.</i>

2124
01:43:07,987 --> 01:43:10,154
Let me be that person for you.

2125
01:43:10,156 --> 01:43:11,157
As you can see,

2126
01:43:12,024 --> 01:43:13,525
it's 20 million.

2127
01:43:13,527 --> 01:43:15,059
Plus the apology.

2128
01:43:15,061 --> 01:43:16,961
- Mmm.
- Correct.

2129
01:43:16,963 --> 01:43:19,431
I can't believe
Fox agreed to the apology.

2130
01:43:19,433 --> 01:43:20,632
I mean, it's unheard of.

2131
01:43:20,634 --> 01:43:22,601
I mean, that never happens.

2132
01:43:22,603 --> 01:43:24,703
But you will have to
sign that.

2133
01:43:24,705 --> 01:43:27,672
It's a strict confidentiality
agreement.

2134
01:43:27,674 --> 01:43:29,608
Money will establish
you told the truth,

2135
01:43:29,610 --> 01:43:31,743
but no one can ever hear it
directly from you.

2136
01:43:31,745 --> 01:43:34,180
You will be muzzled, Gretchen.

2137
01:43:43,657 --> 01:43:44,691
Maybe.

2138
