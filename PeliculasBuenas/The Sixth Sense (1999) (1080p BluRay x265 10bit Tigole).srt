1
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,950
- It's getting cold.
- Thanks.

2
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,792
That is one fine frame.

3
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:21,376
One fine frame, that is.

4
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,636
How much...

5
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:30,851
...does a fine frame
like that cost, do you think?

6
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:36,978
I never told you, but you sound a little
like Dr. Seuss when you're drunk.

7
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,018
Anna, I'm serious.

8
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,229
Serious, I am, Anna.

9
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,367
I'd say it cost
at least a couple hundred.

10
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,779
I'm gonna read it for you.

11
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,614
Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?

12
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,700
"In recognition of his
outstanding achievement

13
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,162
in the field
of child psychology,

14
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,205
his dedication to his work

15
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,883
and his continuing efforts
to improve the quality of life..."

16
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,920
Will you concentrate?

17
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,427
"...his continuing efforts
to improve the quality of life

18
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:12,727
for countless children
and their families,

19
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:16,480
the city of Philadelphia
proudly bestows upon its son,

20
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,183
Dr. Malcolm Crowe..."
That's you.

21
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:22,695
"...the Mayor's Citation
for Professional Excellence."

22
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:27,359
They called you their son.

23
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,900
Wow.

24
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,488
We should hang it in the bathroom.

25
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:38,289
This is an important night for us.

26
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:44,091
Finally, someone is recognizing
the sacrifices you've made.

27
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,636
That you have put everything second,
including me...

28
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,803
...for those families
that they're talking about.

29
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,935
They're also saying
that my husband has a gift.

30
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:03,853
You have a gift that
teaches children how to be strong

31
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:08,657
in situations where most adults
would piss on themselves.

32
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,576
I believe what they wrote is real.

33
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,541
Thank you.

34
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:24,040
I would like some wine in a glass.

35
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:28,298
I would not like it in a mug.
I would not like it in a jug.

36
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,074
Look.

37
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,874
Anna, don't move.
Don't make a sound.

38
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,418
This is 47 Locust Street.

39
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:52,215
You've broken a window
and entered a private residence.

40
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,425
You don't know so many things.

41
00:07:56,059 --> 00:08:00,144
There are no needles or prescription
drugs of any kind in this house.

42
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,898
Do you know why
you're afraid when you're alone?

43
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,032
I do.
I do.

44
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,781
What do you want?

45
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,082
What he promised me!

46
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,916
- I want what he promised me.
- Oh, my God.

47
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,625
Do I know you?

48
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:30,048
Don't you know me, hero?

49
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,544
Don't you even remember
your own patients?

50
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,304
Downtown clinic.

51
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,727
Single-parent family.

52
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,602
Possible mood disorder.

53
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,861
I was afraid!

54
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:55,657
You told me I was having trouble
coping with my parents' divorce. You...

55
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,736
You were wrong.
You were wrong.

56
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,874
Now look at me!

57
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,167
I don't want
to be afraid no more.

58
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,416
Please, just give me
a minute to think.

59
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:11,002
I waited ten years for you!

60
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,675
I'm not giving you nothing!

61
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,469
Ben Friedkin?

62
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,923
Some people, they call me "freak."

63
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,138
Ronald Sumner?

64
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:25,305
I am. I am a freak.
Look at...

65
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,398
Vincent.

66
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:31,560
Vincent Grey.

67
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,485
Don't. Don't.

68
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,992
I do remember you.

69
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:42,029
- No.
- Qulet, very smart.

70
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,950
Compassionate.

71
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,869
Unusually compassionate.

72
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,664
You forgot "cursed."

73
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,632
You failed me.

74
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,013
You failed me!

75
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:08,473
Vincent, I'm sorry if I wasn't...
if I didn't help you.

76
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,392
But if you just... let me try.

77
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,693
You just give me a chance...

78
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:24,454
Oh, God.
Oh, God, honey.

79
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,873
- Did Vincent...
- Now, don't talk.

80
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,147
It's OK, Cole.

81
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:03,689
My name is Dr. Malcolm Crowe.

82
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:07,735
We were supposed to meet today,
but I missed our appointment.

83
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,661
I'm sorry.

84
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:22,924
You know, in the olden days in Europe,
people used to hide out in churches.

85
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:25,844
They would claim sanctuary.

86
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,889
What were they hiding from?

87
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,516
Bad people, mostly.

88
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:43,358
People that wanted
to put them in jail... hurt them.

89
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:49,614
Noticed your eyeglasses.
They don't have any lenses in them.

90
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,866
They're my dad's.

91
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,406
The lenses hurt my eyes.

92
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,419
What were you talking about
with your soldiers when I came in?

93
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,418
It's called "Latin."

94
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,632
All your soldiers speak Latin?

95
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,388
No.

96
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:16,269
Just one.

97
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:21,308
Are you a good doctor?

98
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,234
Well...

99
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:27,314
I used to be.

100
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:31,618
I won an award once from the mayor.

101
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,036
Had an expensive frame.

102
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,379
I'm gonna see you again, right?

103
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:53,215
If that's OK with you.

104
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,383
It's me.

105
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,735
<i>Pennsylvania Turnpike westbound
slow to Valley Forge 24.</i>

106
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:22,873
<i>On the Blue Ridge both directions,
generally slow between number three...</i>

107
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,911
Hey, good morning.

108
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,516
Hey, your Cocoa Puffs
are getting soggy.

109
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:52,523
Let me see you.
Honey, you got a spot.

110
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,492
OK, here it comes.

111
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:19,178
Something you were
looking for, baby?

112
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,724
Pop-Tarts?

113
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:27,846
They're right here.

114
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,852
0h.

115
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,524
What are you thinking, Mama?

116
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,361
Lots of things.

117
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,865
Anything bad about me?

118
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,950
Hey, look at my face.

119
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,875
I was not thinking
something bad about you.

120
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,882
Got it?

121
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,011
Got it.

122
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,389
Get up.

123
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,138
- That's Tommy, Mom.
- OK, you tuck it in.

124
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,220
You want this?

125
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:42,216
Hey, freak, how'd you like
that arm-around-the-shoulder bit?

126
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:46,258
I just made that up.
I went with it as great actors do.

127
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,301
It's called "improv."

128
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,341
Hey, baby.

129
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,977
How was your day?

130
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:40,945
You know, you can
tell me things if you need to.

131
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,157
You know what I did today?

132
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:53,659
I... I won the Pennsylvania Lottery
in the morning.

133
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,540
I quit my jobs.

134
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:01,340
And I ate a big picnic in the park
with lots of chocolate mousse pie.

135
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:05,003
And then I swam
in the fountain all afternoon.

136
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,088
What'd you do?

137
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:15,559
I was picked first
for kickball teams at recess.

138
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,981
I hit a grand slam to win the game.

139
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:21,861
Everybody lifted me up
and carried me around, cheering.

140
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,028
In that case, I am gonna
make you some triangle pancakes.

141
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,242
You got an hour.

142
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,167


143
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,507
Want to sit?

144
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,889
Don't feel like talking today?

145
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,058
Wanna play a game?

146
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,982
It's a mind-reading game.

147
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,905
Here's how it works:

148
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,237
I read your mind.

149
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,945
If what I say is right,
you take one step towards the chair.

150
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:17,000
If what I say is wrong, you take
one step back towards the doorway.

151
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:21,416
If you reach the chair,
you sit down.

152
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:24,708
If you reach the door,
you can go.

153
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,719
Wanna play?

154
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,346
OK.

155
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:57,202
When your mother and father
were first divorced,

156
00:22:57,293 --> 00:23:01,833
your mom went to see a doctor
like me, and he didn't help her,

157
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:05,256
so you think I'm not
going to be able to help you.

158
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:25,310
You're worried that
she said she told him things,

159
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,820
things she couldn't
tell anyone else.

160
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,441
Secrets.

161
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,912
You have a secret,
but you don't want to tell me.

162
00:23:54,183 --> 00:23:58,347
Your dad gave you that watch
as a present just before he went away.

163
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,606
He forgot it in a drawer.

164
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,691
Doesn't work.

165
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:28,631
You keep pretty quiet
in school, but...

166
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,708
...you're a good student.

167
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:34,049
You've never really been
in any serious trouble.

168
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:43,304
We were supposed to draw a picture.

169
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:45,390
Anything we wanted.

170
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,778
I drew a man...

171
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:54,528
...got hurt in the neck
by another man with a screwdriver.

172
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,033
You saw that on TV, Cole?

173
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,661
Everyone got upset.

174
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:10,503
They had a meeting.

175
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,708
Mom started crying.

176
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,594
I don't draw like that anymore.

177
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,557
How do you draw now?

178
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:24,888
Draw... people smiling...

179
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,931
...dogs running...

180
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,192
...rainbows.

181
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,983
They don't have
meetings about rainbows.

182
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:37,658
No.

183
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:39,782
I guess they don't.

184
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,793
What am I thinking now?

185
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:53,503
I don't know
what you're thinking now.

186
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,600
I was thinking,

187
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,635
you're nice...

188
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:09,266
...but you can't help me.

189
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:29,794
I thought you meant the other Italian
restaurant I asked you to marry me in.

190
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:38,044
I'm so sorry, Anna.

191
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,093
I just can't seem
to keep track of time.

192
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,845
And I didn't have
a very good session today. I...

193
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:55,103
They're both so similar.

194
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:58,030
Same mannerisms,
same expressions, same...

195
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,449
...things hanging over their head.

196
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,117
I think it might be some kind of abuse.

197
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:10,243
Cole has... scratches on his arm.

198
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,704
I think they might be fingernail cuts.

199
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,589
Defensive cuts, maybe.
I don't know, Anna.

200
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,926
Maybe a teacher or a neighbor.

201
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:23,506
I don't think it's the mother.
I've seen her with him, and...

202
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,550
...doesn't seem to fit.

203
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,350
Or I could just be wrong.

204
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,562
Maybe he's just a kid
who likes to climb trees a lot.

205
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:49,077
I know that
I've been a little distant. I...

206
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:51,910
I know that It makes you mad.
I just...

207
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:56,297
...feel like I'm being given a second
chance and I don't want it to slip away.

208
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,087
Happy anniversary.

209
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,103
Stop looking at me.

210
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:17,940
I don't like when people
look at me like that.

211
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:19,649
OK.

212
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:24,317
I walk this way to school
with Tommy Tammisimo.

213
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,402
He your best buddy?

214
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,446
He hates me.

215
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,952
Do you hate him?

216
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:32,704
No.

217
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:37,122
Did your mom set that up?

218
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:38,664
Yes.

219
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:43,378
Did you ever talk to your mom
about how things are with Tommy?

220
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:45,964
- I don't tell her things.
- Why not?

221
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:49,475
She doesn't look at me like
everybody else and I don't want her to.

222
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,977
- I don't want her to know.
- Know what?

223
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:54,476
That I'm a freak.

224
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,686
Hey.

225
00:28:56,777 --> 00:29:00,645
You are not a freak. OK?

226
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:05,533
Don't you believe anybody that tries to
convince you of that. That's bullshit!

227
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:08,737
You don't have to go through
your life believing that.

228
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,409
OK?

229
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,001
Come on.

230
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,831
You said the "S" word.

231
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,342
Yeah, I know.

232
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,048
Sorry.

233
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,874
So, your Dad lives in Pittsburg
with a lady that works in a tollbooth?

234
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:42,709
What if she has to pee
when she's working?

235
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,920
Think she just holds it?

236
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,674
I don't know. I was just
thinking about that myself.

237
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:54,425
You asked a lot of questions
about Dad today. How come?

238
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:58,558
Well... sometimes
we do things to draw attention,

239
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:03,226
to express our feelings
about certain issues,

240
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,020
divorce, whatever.

241
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:09,232
For example, a person might
leave something on a desk

242
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,070
for someone else to find.

243
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:19,249
<i>Do you know what
free-association writing is, Cole?</i>

244
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,376
<i>No.</i>

245
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:25,878
<i>Free-association writing is when
you take a pencil in your hand and...</i>

246
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:29,631
<i>you put the pencil to a piece
of paper and you start writing.</i>

247
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,718
<i>You don 't look at what you're writing
or think about what you're writing.</i>

248
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:37,598
<i>You just... keep your hand moving.</i>

249
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:41,355
<i>And after a while, if you
keep your hand moving long enough,</i>

250
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:45,730
<i>words and thoughts start coming out that
you didn't even know you had in you.</i>

251
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:50,611
<i>Could be... something
you heard somewhere else, or...</i>

252
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:53,822
<i>...feelings you had
deep inside of you.</i>

253
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:00,495
<i>Have you ever done any
free-association writing, Cole?</i>

254
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,173
<i>- Yes.
- What did you write?</i>

255
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:11,460
Upset words.

256
00:32:13,098 --> 00:32:16,591
Did you ever write any upset words
before your father left?

257
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,177
I don't remember.

258
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:23,848
Can you do something for me?

259
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:30,442
I want you to... think about what you
want to get out of our time together,

260
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:32,523
what our goals should be.

261
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,697
Something I want?

262
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:41,161
If you could change something in your
life, anything at all, what would it be?

263
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:45,544
Instead of something I want,
can it be something I don't want?

264
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,413
OK.

265
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:52,092
I don't want
to be scared anymore.

266
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,849
You gonna get that?

267
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:15,779
Are you gonna get that?

268
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,955
- Hey.

269
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:24,329
Don't you see
enough of me at the store?

270
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:28,253
I'm on my way out to the flea market
in the Amish country, and I thought...

271
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,083
you'd wanna come along and show me
how to buy at one of these things.

272
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:35,044
I don't know if I can
deal with the Amish today.

273
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:38,088
You can't curse or spit
or anything around them.

274
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:41,301
I just figured maybe
you just wanted to get some air,

275
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,761
because you'd seemed
kind of down lately.

276
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:48,690
I'm 0K.

277
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:52,065
All right. Do you think that maybe
I should stop by on my way back

278
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:55,481
and show you what I got?
'Cause that wouldn't be a problem.

279
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:58,943
No. I... You know,
I can see them on Monday.

280
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,904
Sure. Yeah, that's fine.
Understood.

281
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:05,871
OK, so I guess I'm gonna get going
then, and I'll speak to you later.

282
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:09,795
- Don't step in the horse manure.
- Well, thank you very much.

283
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:20,468
Keep moving, cheese-dick.

284
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,494
Can anybody guess what city was
capital of the United States of America

285
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:53,756
from 1790 to 1800?

286
00:34:56,845 --> 00:35:00,554
I'll give you a hint:
It's the city you live in.

287
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,881
- Philadelphia.
- Right, right.

288
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:06,059
Philadelphia's one of
the oldest cities in this country.

289
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:08,854
A lot of generations have
lived here and died here.

290
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:13,517
Almost any place you go in this city
has a history and a story behind it.

291
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,528
Even this school
and the grounds it sits on.

292
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:21,030
Can anyone guess what this building
was used for a hundred years ago,

293
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:25,571
before you went to school here,
before I went to this school, even?

294
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,705
Yes. Cole.

295
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:39,168
They used to hang people here.

296
00:35:43,725 --> 00:35:47,514
No. That... That's not correct.
Where'd you hear that?

297
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:52,523
They'd pull the people in,
crying and kissing their families bye.

298
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:56,652
People watching... spit at them.

299
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,940
Cole, this building
was a legal courthouse.

300
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:06,029
Laws were passed here, some of
the very first laws of this country.

301
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:09,290
This whole building
was full of lawyers, lawmakers.

302
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:11,913
They were the ones
that hanged everybody.

303
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,629
I don't know which one
of these guys told you that, but...

304
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,051
...they were just trying to scare you.

305
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,898
I don't like people
looking at me like that.

306
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:38,147
Like what?

307
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:40,320
Stop it!

308
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:43,820
I... I don't know how else to look.

309
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,277
You're Stuttering Stanley!

310
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,956
Excuse me?

311
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:55,832
You talked funny when you went to school
here and all the way to high school.

312
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,037


313
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:59,965
You shouldn't look at people.
It makes them feel bad.

314
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,042
- How did you...
- Stop looking at me!

315
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:05,425
Who have you...
been speaking to?

316
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:08,761
Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley!

317
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,097
- Stop it.
- Stuttering Stanley!

318
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:13,433
- Stop that!
- Stuttering Stanley!

319
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,519
- Stuttering Stanley!
- Stop it.

320
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:19,021
Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley!

321
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:22,355
Shut up, you freak!

322
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:39,288
Hey, big guy.

323
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,335
How's it going?

324
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:48,343
I don't wanna talk
about anything right now.

325
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:50,265
OK.

326
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,024
You like magic?

327
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:17,076
Observe: the magic penny.

328
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:20,083
Looks like
an ordinary penny.

329
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:22,505
But I do my little magic shake, and...

330
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,547
...now it's in my right hand.

331
00:38:26,596 --> 00:38:29,714
But that's not the end
of the magic trick.

332
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:32,391
I do another little shake, and...

333
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:37,100
...right there in the vest pocket.

334
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:40,850
But that's not the end
of the magic trick.

335
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:43,394
I do another little shake...

336
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,107
and...

337
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:50,196
...right back in the left hand
where it started.

338
00:38:51,788 --> 00:38:53,779
That isn't magic.

339
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:57,411
What are you talking about?
Of course it's magic.

340
00:38:57,502 --> 00:39:00,494
You just kept the penny
in that hand the whole time.

341
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,092
Think so?

342
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,754
I didn't know you were funny.

343
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:28,564
<i>Malcolm, sit your
cute butt down and listen up.</i>

344
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:33,569
<i>No doubt about it.
Anna is like my sister.</i>

345
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:37,364
<i>And you better make her happy.
And I'm not talking about no...</i>

346
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,246
<i>"this taste like real butter"
kind of happy.</i>

347
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:42,957
<i>I'm talking about...
What's up, girl?</i>

348
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:45,464
<i>"Julie Andrews twirling around</i>

349
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,463
<i>like a mental patient on a mountaintop"
kind of happy.</i>

350
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:51,845
<i>Now, that's the kind of happy
I'm talking about.</i>

351
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,763
<i>Come here.</i>

352
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:56,095
<i>Don't tell herl told you,</i>

353
00:39:56,144 --> 00:39:59,557
<i>but she said
she knew she love you...</i>

354
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,765
<i>from the first time
she met you on the street.</i>

355
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,480
<i>She'd do anything for you.</i>

356
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,401
<i>Have you guys.</i>

357
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:15,326
<i>My nose is running.
Turn it...</i>

358
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:37,408
And then you do the magic shake.

359
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:40,070
The penny has moved
from my pocket...

360
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,747
...all the way back
to the hand it started in.

361
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,202
That's stupid.

362
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,582
It's supposed to be funny.

363
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:53,625
It's stupid.

364
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,711
I want my penny back.

365
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,474
- He doesn't get invited places, so...
- It's our pleasure.

366
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:04,804
Last time was a Chuck E. Cheese
party a year ago.

367
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:08,811
He hid in one of those purple
plastic tunnels and didn't come out.

368
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:12,394
- Chucky who?
- Cheese. It's a kids place.

369
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:15,280
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

370
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,678
Sir.

371
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,727


372
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,979
Is someone out there?

373
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,354
Open this door, please.
Come on.

374
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:57,485
I can't breathe.

375
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,533
If you can hear me,
open this door.

376
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,783
I swear on my life I didn't
take the master's horse.

377
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:08,541
Open this door, or I'll break
through it and grab you!

378
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:11,586
The star of the commercial
always gets his own trailer.

379
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,003
For what?

380
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:16,132
He needs a place to think
about his character, alone.

381
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:18,339
You only had one line.

382
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,381
Darren, check it out.

383
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:25,467
Oh, yeah.

384
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,012
My dad made me invite him.

385
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,077
Happy birthday, Darren.

386
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:51,326
Is there something
you wanna see in there?

387
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:53,040
No.

388
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:57,882
We're gonna
put on a pretend play.

389
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:00,427
Wanna be in it?

390
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:02,174
OK.

391
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:05,466
It's called
<i>Locked in the Dungeon.</i>

392
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:09,224
Yeah, Cole, and... you get to be
the one locked in the dungeon.

393
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:15,562
Don1!Don1!
Don1!Don1!

394
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:18,729
Nn'm

395
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:21,064
Let me out!
No! No! No!

396
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:23,241
No!No!No!

397
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:47,132
Help! Help! Help!

398
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,716
- Cole?
- Oh, no!

399
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,352
Help! Help!

400
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:56,809
Oh, my God.
Is there a key for this door?

401
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:59,144
Cole? Honey, honey,
can you hear me?

402
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:01,946
- Open the door!
- God!

403
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,990
- Oh, my God, Cole!
- Oh, my God! Help me!

404
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,242
Help! Help!

405
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:25,629
The tests would indicate
he did not have a seizure.

406
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,922
He's doing fine.

407
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,467
After some rest,
he can go home tonight.

408
00:45:37,193 --> 00:45:40,356
There's some cuts
and bruises on your son

409
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:43,484
- that are oonoemlng me.
- Man.

410
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:47,567
Yeah, those are from sports.

411
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:55,496
You think I hurt my child?

412
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:01,206
You think I'm a bad mother?

413
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,758
Mrs. Sloan over there,

414
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:06,506
she's a social worker
with the hospital,

415
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:09,968
and she's gonna ask you
a couple procedural questions.

416
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:13,635
What happened to my child today?

417
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:16,726
Something was happening to him,
physically happening.

418
00:46:16,816 --> 00:46:18,978
Something was very wrong!

419
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:25,321
Hey.

420
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:39,127
Did your father used to
tell you bedtime stories?

421
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:52,803
Once upon a time,
there was this young prince,

422
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:57,262
and he decided that
he wanted to go for a drive.

423
00:46:57,356 --> 00:47:00,690
And he got his driver,

424
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:02,726
and they started driving.

425
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,769
Driving, driving.

426
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:08,861
Driving a lot, and...

427
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:13,695
...they drove so much
that he fell asleep.

428
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:16,535
And...

429
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:23,587
Then he woke up,
and he realized they were still driving.

430
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:26,374
- This was a very long trip.
- Dr. Crowe?

431
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,841
You haven't told
bedtime stories before.

432
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,138
Not too many, no.

433
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:35,717
You have to add
some twists and stuff.

434
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:39,478
OK. Some twists.

435
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:44,438
Like what kind of twists?
Give me an example.

436
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:48,275
Maybe they run out of gas.

437
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:52,409
They run out of gas? That's good,
'cause they're driving, right? 0K...

438
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:55,536
Tell me the story
about why you're sad.

439
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:00,371
You think I'm sad?

440
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,292
What makes you think that?

441
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:09,296
Your eyes told me.

442
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:13,839
I'm not supposed to talk
about stuff like that.

443
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:28,444
Once upon a time, there was
this person named Malcolm.

444
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:32,198
He worked with children.

445
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:34,867
He loved it.

446
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:37,616
He loved it more than anything else.

447
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:43,664
And then one night,
he found out that he made a...

448
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,916
...mistake with one of them.

449
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:48,168
He couldn't help that one.

450
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:54,550
And he can't stop thinking about it.
He... can't forget.

451
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:00,680
Ever since then,
things have been different.

452
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:05,144
He's not the same person
that he used to be.

453
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:09,235
And his wife

454
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:12,188
doesn't like the person
that he's become.

455
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:15,947
They barely speak anymore.
They're like strangers.

456
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:22,703
And then one day, Malcolm
meets this wonderful little boy.

457
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:25,584
A really cool little boy.

458
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:29,373
Reminds him a lot of the other one.

459
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,923
And Malcolm decides
to try and help this new boy...

460
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:41,802
...'cause he feels that
if he can help this new boy,

461
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:46,231
be like...
helping that other one too.

462
00:49:49,195 --> 00:49:51,903
How does the story end?

463
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:55,482
I don't know.

464
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:16,048
I want to tell you my secret now.

465
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,803
OK.

466
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:32,360
I see dead people.

467
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:36,940
In your dreams?

468
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:41,115
While you're awake?

469
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:50,537
Dead people, like,
in graves and coffins?

470
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:53,840
Walking around like regular people.

471
00:50:53,926 --> 00:50:57,135
They don't see each other.

472
00:50:57,179 --> 00:51:00,297
They only see
what they want to see.

473
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,640
They don't know they're dead.

474
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,433
How often do you see them?

475
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:14,318
All the time.

476
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:18,899
They're everywhere.

477
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:24,488
You won't tell anyone
my secret, right?

478
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:27,282
No. I promise.

479
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:32,246
Will you stay here
until I fall asleep?

480
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:35,840
Of course.

481
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:51,435
<i>Cole... has pathologies more
severe than initially assessed.</i>

482
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:56,186
He's suffering from
visual hallucinations,

483
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,946
paranoia...

484
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:03,368
...some kind of...
school-age schizophrenia.

485
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:08,869
Medication, hospitalization
may be required.

486
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,464
And I'm not helping him.

487
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:47,172
Hi. This is Lynn Sear, Cole's <i>mom.</i>

488
00:53:48,809 --> 00:53:52,894
Yeah. Yeah, I'd like
to talk to you about your boy

489
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:56,393
and his friends keeping
their goddamn hands off my son.

490
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:35,787


491
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:40,327
No. Dinner is not ready!

492
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,081
What are you gonna do?

493
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,963
You can't hurt me anymore!

494
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:49,710
Lenny, you're
a terrible husband, Lenny!

495
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:53,097
Look what you made me dol
Lenny!

496
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:06,936
I'm OK. OK. OK.

497
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:14,568
Once there was a boy,

498
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:17,409
very different from all the other boys.

499
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:20,290
He lived in the jungle...

500
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:24,128
...and he could speak
to the animals.

501
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:41,724
Did you think
the play sucked big time?

502
00:56:42,983 --> 00:56:44,644


503
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:47,727
Tommy Tammisimo acted
in a cough syrup commercial.

504
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:51,064
He said everyone was
self-conscious and unrealistic.

505
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:53,399
He said the play sucked big time.

506
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:56,235
This Tommy kid
sounds like a real punk.

507
00:56:57,915 --> 00:57:01,909
I thought the play was excellent.
Better than Cats.

508
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:04,494
- <i>Cats?</i>
- Never mind.

509
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:10,466
Cole, I was really interested in
what you told me at the hospital.

510
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:13,002
I'd like to hear more about it.

511
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:24,680
Cole?

512
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,522


513
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:44,700
Something up there?

514
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:51,465
Cole?

515
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:56,837
I don't see anything.

516
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:03,260
Be real still.

517
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,233
Sometimes you feel it inside,

518
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,028
like you're falling down real fast,

519
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:15,735
but you're really just standing still.

520
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:25,079
Do you ever feel the prickly
things on the back of your neck?

521
00:58:25,127 --> 00:58:26,959
Yes.

522
00:58:27,963 --> 00:58:31,957
And the tiny hairs on your arm,
you know, when they stand up?

523
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,882
Yes.

524
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:38,212
That's them.

525
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,680
When they get mad...

526
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,765
...it gets cold.

527
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:10,912
I don't see anything.
Are you sure they're there?

528
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:14,210
Cole?

529
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:19,420
Please make them leave.

530
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:21,464
I'm workin' on it.

531
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:25,684
Come on.

532
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:13,356
<i>Mommy, Daddy?</i>

533
01:00:16,404 --> 01:00:18,736
<i>My throat hurts.</i>

534
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,122
<i>Run! Run!</i>

535
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,993
<i>Pedia Ease cough suppressant.</i>

536
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:36,084
<i>Gentle, fast, eff...</i>

537
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:37,585


538
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:41,551
I don't care what they say.
This thing is broken.

539
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:51,387
Take 'em off.

540
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:57,480
I don't want them on my table.

541
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,363
I saw what was in your
bureau drawer when I was cleaning.

542
01:01:05,412 --> 01:01:07,619
Got something you want to confess?

543
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:15,916
The bumblebee pendant?
Why do you keep taking it?

544
01:01:20,552 --> 01:01:22,714
It was Grandma's.

545
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:26,096
You know, what if it broke?
You know how sad I'd be.

546
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:31,260
You'd cry 'cause you
miss Grandma so much.

547
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:34,263
That's right.

548
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:42,192
Sometimes people think
they lose things...

549
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:47,826
...and they really didn't lose them,
it just gets moved.

550
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:50,405
So, did you move
the bumblebee pendant?

551
01:01:58,298 --> 01:02:00,289
Don't get mad.

552
01:02:00,342 --> 01:02:02,333
So, who moved it this time?

553
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:05,761
Maybe someone came in our house,
took the bumblebee pendant

554
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:08,968
out of my closet
and placed it nicely in your drawer.

555
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:13,556
- Maybe.
- God, I am so tlred, Cole.

556
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:16,139
I'm tired in my body,
I'm tired in my mind,

557
01:02:16,191 --> 01:02:18,899
I'm... tired in my heart.

558
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:22,319
I need some help.
You know, I don't know if you noticed,

559
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:25,693
but our little family
isn't doing so good.

560
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:29,778
I mean, I've been praying,
but I must not be praying right.

561
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:34,664
Looks like we're just gonna
have to answer each other's prayers.

562
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:40,420
If we can't talk to each other,
we're not gonna make it.

563
01:02:44,052 --> 01:02:47,716
Now, tell me, baby.
I... I won't get mad, honey.

564
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:50,639
Did you take
the bumblebee pendant?

565
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:00,690
No.

566
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:06,405
You've had enough roast beef.
You need to leave the table.

567
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:10,112


568
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:38,137
Hey, come on. I'll show you
where my dad keeps his gun. Come on.

569
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:46,312
Sebastian, <i>come</i> on.

570
01:03:47,407 --> 01:03:49,239


571
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:58,577
If you're not very mad,

572
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:01,330
can I sleep in your bed tonight?

573
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:05,665
Look at my face.

574
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:07,921
I'm not very mad.

575
01:04:13,058 --> 01:04:15,550
Baby, why are you shaking?

576
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:18,806
Cole, what's wrong?

577
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:22,686
Oh, God, please tell me!

578
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:24,767
Oh, please.

579
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,949
It's Edwardian,

580
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:43,790
beautifully worked
with mine-cut diamonds

581
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:47,123
and an actual color
Burmese sapphire.

582
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:49,379
It's timeless.

583
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,963
You...

584
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:57,220
...got anything a little plainer?

585
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:59,142
Plainer?

586
01:04:59,187 --> 01:05:02,805
You want a plain ring to go with
your plain fiancé? Is that how it is?

587
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:06,062
No! Baby, don't get in a tizzy.

588
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:13,448
You're so beautiful.

589
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:17,157
You're like a Burmese sapphire
all by yourself.

590
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:20,205
You don't need all that.

591
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:24,785
Why don't you try it on
and see how you both feel about it?

592
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:32,505
There. How does that feel?

593
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:37,631
I think this piece
communicates a longing.

594
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:41,302
I imagine that
the woman who owned it

595
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:44,187
loved a man
that she couldn't be with.

596
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:49,025
Did he have wavy hair
and chestnut eyes?

597
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:51,274


598
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:53,355
I don't know, but...

599
01:05:53,408 --> 01:05:56,321
...a lot of the pieces
in this store communicate,

600
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:59,532
and I think you should choose
a piece that speaks to you.

601
01:06:01,249 --> 01:06:05,413
I think maybe when people own things
and then they pass away,

602
01:06:05,503 --> 01:06:09,622
a part of themselves gets
printed on those things,

603
01:06:09,716 --> 01:06:13,209
like... like fingerprints.

604
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:16,920
I'll just wrap it up.

605
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:26,729
You don't need a guy
with a master's.

606
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:29,808
You need a wrestler with
a neck larger than his head.

607
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:32,895
No, I need a wrestler
with a master's.

608
01:06:33,948 --> 01:06:36,565
- What's this?
- Happy birthday.

609
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:38,609
From you?

610
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:48,410
It's a...

611
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:50,667
...first edition.

612
01:06:50,757 --> 01:06:52,589
Wow.

613
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:54,837
This is too much.

614
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:58,421
No. Took it out of
your Christmas bonus.

615
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,637
It's perfect, Anna.

616
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:04,559
Thanks.

617
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:13,602
<i>What do you want
more than anything?</i>

618
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:15,687
<i>I don 't know.</i>

619
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:17,944
<i>I told you what I want.</i>

620
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:23,619
<i>I know what I want.</i>

621
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:28,333
<i>I want to be able
to talk to my wife again...</i>

622
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:32,621
<i>...the way we used
to talk to each other...</i>

623
01:07:33,925 --> 01:07:36,917
<i>...Iike there was no one else
in the world except us.</i>

624
01:07:38,972 --> 01:07:40,963
<i>How are you gonna do that?</i>

625
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:48,478
I can't be your doctor anymore.

626
01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:52,892
I haven't paid enough attention
to my family.

627
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:55,318
Bad things happen when you do that.

628
01:07:56,823 --> 01:07:59,440
Do you understand?

629
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:02,075
I'm going to transfer you.
I know two psychol...

630
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:04,493
Don't fail me.

631
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:09,913
Don't give up. You're the only one
who can help me. I know it.

632
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:12,165
I can't help you.

633
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:17,173
You...

634
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:19,592
Someone else can help you.

635
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,847
You believe me, right?

636
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:32,188
Dr. Crowe,
you believe my secret, right?

637
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:37,106
I don't know how to answer that, Cole.

638
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:50,036
How can you help me...

639
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:52,746
...if you don't believe me?

640
01:08:56,716 --> 01:08:59,708
Some magic's real.

641
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:19,023
Do you know why
you're afraid when you're alone?

642
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:24,157
I do.
I do.

643
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:35,161
<i>I'm sorry about that, Vincent. I hope
ldidn't leave you alone too long.</i>

644
01:09:36,756 --> 01:09:38,747
<i>It's cold in here.</i>

645
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:44,257
<i>Vincent, why are you crying?</i>

646
01:09:50,395 --> 01:09:52,727
<i>You won 't believe.</i>

647
01:09:57,443 --> 01:10:01,562
<i>I'm sorry about that, Vincent. I hope
ldidn't leave you alone too long.</i>

648
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:05,148
<i>It's cold in here.</i>

649
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:08,535
<i>Vincent...</i>

650
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:14,116
<i>It's cold in here.</i>

651
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:23,922
<i>No, you know what?
I never liked them either.</i>

652
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:26,462
<i>When I was a kid,
[had this blood test done,</i>

653
01:10:26,514 --> 01:10:31,008
<i>andl threw up chili cheese
fries all over this male nurse.</i>

654
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:34,932
<i>Excuse me.
Dr. Reed is on line two.</i>

655
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:37,814
<i>Vincent, will you excuse me?
Ihave to take this.</i>

656
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,392
- <i>Just give me</i> a <i>minute, OK?</i>
- <i>OK.</i>

657
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:11,274
Oh, my God.

658
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:20,992
You been running around?

659
01:12:24,507 --> 01:12:26,999
Make you feel better?

660
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:31,010
I like to run around.
It's good exercise.

661
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:36,884
Do you wanna
ask me questions now?

662
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:42,644
Wanna be a corporal in Company M,
Third Battalion, Seventh Marines?

663
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:45,600
We're being dispatched
into the Quang Nam province.

664
01:12:45,653 --> 01:12:47,485
Maybe later.

665
01:12:50,283 --> 01:12:52,570
Something happened, didn't it?

666
01:12:54,662 --> 01:12:57,029
You wigging out?

667
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:01,033
Yes.

668
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:02,959
I think I am.

669
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:08,965
<i>Do you</i> know what
<i>"yo no quiero morir"</i> means?

670
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:12,423
It's Spanish.
It means "I don't want to die."

671
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:17,928
What do you think these ghosts want
when they talk to you?

672
01:13:25,526 --> 01:13:27,688
I want you to think about it, Cole.

673
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:32,614
I want you to think about it
really carefully.

674
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:34,820
What do you think they want?

675
01:13:38,831 --> 01:13:40,663
Just help.

676
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:43,541
That's right.
That's what I think too.

677
01:13:43,628 --> 01:13:46,370
They just want help,
even the scary ones.

678
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:49,502
And I think I might know a way
to make them go away.

679
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:51,336
How?

680
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:54,294
Listen to them.

681
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:58,427
What if they don't want help?

682
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:02,010
What if they're just angry
and they just want to hurt somebody?

683
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:04,395
I don't think
that's the way it works.

684
01:14:04,482 --> 01:14:06,473
How do you know for sure?

685
01:14:08,611 --> 01:14:10,443
I don't.

686
01:14:31,258 --> 01:14:32,919
Hey.

687
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:36,215
Hey! Hey!

688
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:57,899
What's happening?

689
01:14:59,245 --> 01:15:01,577
What's... What's happening?

690
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:10,419
What's...

691
01:15:18,139 --> 01:15:20,847
What's happening to you?

692
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:24,142
Is someone hurting you?
HI... I will kick their ass.

693
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:26,390
Cole, if they're hurting you...

694
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:42,072
Mama, you sleep now.

695
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:52,248
I'm feeling much better now.

696
01:17:56,589 --> 01:17:59,581
Do you want
to tell me something?

697
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:38,703
She came a long way to visit me,
didn't she?

698
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:42,081
I guess she did.

699
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:30,713
Can you get some water?

700
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:36,678
That's her sister.

701
01:19:54,498 --> 01:19:58,833
...you know, and I went through this
with my father's cancer, but...

702
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:02,290
I just can't imagine a child
being in bed for two years.

703
01:20:02,381 --> 01:20:04,873
How many...
How many doctors?

704
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:07,834
- I think it was six.
- Six different doctors?

705
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:09,877
I think so, yes.

706
01:20:16,186 --> 01:20:20,680
I just heard the...
the little one is falling i" now.

707
01:20:20,733 --> 01:20:22,724
God help them.

708
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:45,125
Don't go home, 0K?

709
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:47,206
I definitely won't.

710
01:22:46,086 --> 01:22:47,918


711
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:53,499
Excuse me, mister.

712
01:22:58,098 --> 01:23:00,590
Are you Kyra's daddy?

713
01:23:14,156 --> 01:23:16,147
It's for you.

714
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:20,659
She wanted to tell you something.

715
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:01,780
<i>Oh, no! Here he comes!
Look, he's coming my way.</i>

716
01:24:06,124 --> 01:24:08,115
<i>Would you like to dance?</i>

717
01:24:09,336 --> 01:24:12,874
<i>Well, actually,
I just came with my friends.</i>

718
01:24:12,965 --> 01:24:15,548
<i>Well, how about this?</i>

719
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:19,548
<i>We can dance for a little bit,
and if you don 't like the way I dance,</i>

720
01:24:19,638 --> 01:24:21,470
<i>you can kick me.</i>

721
01:24:21,515 --> 01:24:23,506
<i>OK then.</i>

722
01:25:32,628 --> 01:25:35,336
<i>It's time for lunch, Kyra.</i>

723
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:44,045
<i>- I'm feeling much better now.
- That's so great, honey.</i>

724
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:46,130
<i>It's time for your food.</i>

725
01:25:47,768 --> 01:25:50,100
<i>Can I go outside
if I eat this?</i>

726
01:25:50,187 --> 01:25:54,522
<i>I don 't know. You know how you get
sick in the afternoons. We 'II</i> see.

727
01:25:56,985 --> 01:26:01,229
<i>Don 't say that it tastes funny.
You know I don 't like to hear that.</i>

728
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:05,358
<i>Sammie 's mom called.</i>

729
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:25,423
You were keeping her sick.

730
01:26:42,781 --> 01:26:45,273
You liked it, she said.

731
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:50,282
She looked out for you.

732
01:26:51,498 --> 01:26:54,035
Is Kyra coming back?

733
01:26:56,878 --> 01:26:58,869
Not anymore.

734
01:27:06,012 --> 01:27:08,344
- All right.
- Yeah. I think that's enough.

735
01:27:08,432 --> 01:27:10,423
- That's enough makeup.
- OK.

736
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:13,972
They're calling for the stable boy.

737
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:16,011
We have to hurry!

738
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:21,643
Who... Who were you talking to?

739
01:27:28,201 --> 01:27:30,363
Just practicing my lines.

740
01:27:33,665 --> 01:27:36,327
Thanks for giving me this part,
Mr. Cunningham.

741
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:38,367
You know,
when I went to school here,

742
01:27:38,462 --> 01:27:40,999
there was a terrible fire
in the theater.

743
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:43,080
They rebuilt the whole thing.

744
01:27:43,175 --> 01:27:45,007
Yeah, I know.

745
01:27:56,271 --> 01:28:01,266
Only he who is pure of heart
can take the sword from the stone.

746
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:03,350
Let the boy try.

747
01:28:10,994 --> 01:28:14,112
But he is a stable boy.
He cleans up after the horses.

748
01:28:14,206 --> 01:28:16,197
Silence, village idiot.

749
01:28:17,334 --> 01:28:19,996
Let the boy step forward.

750
01:28:47,113 --> 01:28:49,946
Hail King Arthur!

751
01:28:55,497 --> 01:28:57,738
Yeah!

752
01:28:57,833 --> 01:29:00,040
LFI-Tflfl

753
01:29:22,482 --> 01:29:25,144
I thought you were really great
in the play, Cole.

754
01:29:25,235 --> 01:29:27,647
- Really?
- Yeah.

755
01:29:27,737 --> 01:29:30,274
- You know what else?
- What?

756
01:29:30,365 --> 01:29:33,278
I thought Tommy Tammisimo
sucked big time.

757
01:29:41,668 --> 01:29:45,252
I got an idea
how you can talk to your wife.

758
01:29:45,297 --> 01:29:48,380
Wait till she's asleep.

759
01:29:48,466 --> 01:29:52,130
Then she'll listen to you
and she won't even know it.

760
01:29:59,311 --> 01:30:01,643
I'm not gonna
see you anymore, am I?

761
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:07,729
I think we said
everything we needed to say.

762
01:30:08,904 --> 01:30:12,238
Maybe it's time to say things
to someone closer to you.

763
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:17,443
Maybe we can pretend like
we're gonna see each other tomorrow.

764
01:30:19,331 --> 01:30:21,322
Just for pretend.

765
01:30:27,756 --> 01:30:29,588
OK.

766
01:30:34,346 --> 01:30:36,337
I'm gonna go now.

767
01:30:43,063 --> 01:30:45,771
I'll see you tomorrow, Cole.

768
01:31:12,676 --> 01:31:15,964
I'm 0K, officer. I'm OK.

769
01:31:16,054 --> 01:31:18,216
I don't know
what happened.

770
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:29,731
Jeez, I hope nobody got hurt.

771
01:31:33,321 --> 01:31:36,404
You're very quiet.

772
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:39,825
You're mad I missed the play,
aren't you?

773
01:31:39,911 --> 01:31:42,243
I have two jobs, baby.

774
01:31:42,288 --> 01:31:44,780
You know how important
they are for us.

775
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:49,997
I'd give anything
to have been there.

776
01:32:01,933 --> 01:32:04,425
I'm ready to communicate
with you now.

777
01:32:09,315 --> 01:32:11,147
Communicate?

778
01:32:12,944 --> 01:32:15,276
Tell you my secrets.

779
01:32:17,032 --> 01:32:19,023
What is it?

780
01:32:23,246 --> 01:32:25,954
You know the accident up there?

781
01:32:25,999 --> 01:32:27,831
Yeah?

782
01:32:29,127 --> 01:32:31,243
Someone got hurt.

783
01:32:31,296 --> 01:32:33,458
They did?

784
01:32:33,506 --> 01:32:35,338
A lady.

785
01:32:37,135 --> 01:32:39,467
She died.

786
01:32:39,512 --> 01:32:42,004
Oh, my God.
What, you can see her?

787
01:32:43,224 --> 01:32:45,056
Yes.

788
01:32:45,143 --> 01:32:47,134
Where is she?

789
01:32:49,981 --> 01:32:52,473
Standing next to my window.

790
01:33:00,116 --> 01:33:03,108
Cole, you're scaring me.

791
01:33:03,161 --> 01:33:05,619
They scare me too sometimes.

792
01:33:07,665 --> 01:33:09,497
They?

793
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:15,332
Ghosts.

794
01:33:18,843 --> 01:33:21,175
You see ghosts, Cole?

795
01:33:24,182 --> 01:33:27,174
They want me to do things for them.

796
01:33:29,729 --> 01:33:32,141
They... They talk to you?

797
01:33:33,066 --> 01:33:35,353
They tell you to do things?

798
01:33:36,277 --> 01:33:38,939
They're the ones that used to hurt me.

799
01:33:40,657 --> 01:33:43,570
What are you thinking, Mama?

800
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:48,120
- You think I'm a freak?
- Look at my face.

801
01:33:48,206 --> 01:33:51,369
I would never thlnk that about you.
Ever.

802
01:33:52,544 --> 01:33:55,036
- Got it?
- Got it.

803
01:34:02,220 --> 01:34:04,552
Just let me think for a minute.

804
01:34:08,268 --> 01:34:10,509
Grandma says hi.

805
01:34:13,815 --> 01:34:17,024
She says she's sorry for taking
the bumblebee pendant.

806
01:34:17,068 --> 01:34:19,230
She just likes it a lot.

807
01:34:21,614 --> 01:34:23,400


808
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:26,233
Grandma comes
to visit me sometimes.

809
01:34:28,413 --> 01:34:30,905
Cole, that's very wrong.

810
01:34:30,999 --> 01:34:33,957
- Grandma's gone, you know that.
- I know.

811
01:34:34,043 --> 01:34:36,535
- She wanted me to tell you...
- Please stop.

812
01:34:36,588 --> 01:34:39,250
She wanted me to tell you
she saw you dance.

813
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:45,260
She said... when you were little,

814
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:47,508
you and her had a fight

815
01:34:47,599 --> 01:34:50,387
right before your dance recital.

816
01:34:54,063 --> 01:34:57,556
You thought she didn't
come to see you dance.

817
01:35:01,154 --> 01:35:03,316
She did.

818
01:35:08,703 --> 01:35:11,536
She hid in the back
so you wouldn't see.

819
01:35:12,624 --> 01:35:15,582
She said you were like an angel.

820
01:35:20,173 --> 01:35:22,335
She said...

821
01:35:22,425 --> 01:35:25,588
...you came to the place
where they buried her...

822
01:35:27,972 --> 01:35:30,304
...asked her a question.

823
01:35:32,894 --> 01:35:35,556
She said the answer is...

824
01:35:37,357 --> 01:35:39,473
..."Every day."

825
01:35:41,903 --> 01:35:44,235
What did you ask?

826
01:35:52,455 --> 01:35:54,116
Do...

827
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:58,500
Do I make her proud?

828
01:36:02,006 --> 01:36:04,498


829
01:36:33,371 --> 01:36:35,203
<i>Hi, everybody.</i>

830
01:36:35,290 --> 01:36:38,874
<i>As most of you know,
I'm not used to doing this,</i>

831
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:42,874
<i>and I promised Anna that
I 'd try not to embarrass her.</i>

832
01:36:42,922 --> 01:36:45,084
<i>I'll leave that to her mother.</i>

833
01:36:46,843 --> 01:36:49,210
<i>But we do want to thank
all of you for coming</i>

834
01:36:49,304 --> 01:36:52,092
<i>and for sharing
this wonderful day with us.</i>

835
01:36:52,181 --> 01:36:56,345
<i>It's bittersweet, almost, for me,
because I hate giving her up...</i>

836
01:36:57,353 --> 01:36:59,344
Anna?

837
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:11,481
I miss you.

838
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:19,914
I miss you too.

839
01:37:20,001 --> 01:37:22,868
Why, Malcolm?

840
01:37:23,796 --> 01:37:25,628


841
01:37:27,425 --> 01:37:31,089
- What is it? What?
- Why did you leave me?

842
01:37:31,137 --> 01:37:33,970
I didn't leave you.

843
01:37:54,994 --> 01:37:57,076
I see people.

844
01:37:58,915 --> 01:38:01,452
They don't know they're dead.

845
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:08,293
How often do you see them?

846
01:38:08,383 --> 01:38:10,374
All the time.

847
01:38:13,012 --> 01:38:14,969
They're everywhere.

848
01:38:25,316 --> 01:38:28,809
They only see
what they want to see.

849
01:38:33,157 --> 01:38:35,990
<i>OK, Mikey.</i>

850
01:38:37,787 --> 01:38:41,121
Come <i>on.
Give me a minute.</i>

851
01:39:18,953 --> 01:39:21,490
Oh, God.
Oh, God, honey.

852
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:25,202
- Let me see.
- It doesn't even hurt.

853
01:39:27,753 --> 01:39:30,415
Let me see.
Take your hand...

854
01:39:30,506 --> 01:39:32,338
Oh, God.

855
01:39:38,723 --> 01:39:40,805
OK. OK.

856
01:39:58,743 --> 01:40:03,408
Anna, I think I'm OK.
Really, I think it just went...

857
01:40:03,498 --> 01:40:05,990
...went in and out. I...

858
01:40:08,878 --> 01:40:11,370
It doesn't even hurt anymore.

859
01:40:41,285 --> 01:40:43,617
I think I can go now.

860
01:40:47,625 --> 01:40:50,287
Just needed to do a couple things.

861
01:40:55,174 --> 01:40:57,506
I needed to help someone.

862
01:41:00,304 --> 01:41:02,466
I think I did.

863
01:41:08,646 --> 01:41:11,479
And I needed to tell you something.

864
01:41:16,237 --> 01:41:18,399
You were never second.

865
01:41:19,407 --> 01:41:21,239
Even

866
01:41:24,245 --> 01:41:26,407
I love you.

867
01:41:32,545 --> 01:41:34,707
You sleep now.

868
01:41:36,632 --> 01:41:39,340
Everything will be different
in the morning.

869
01:41:45,391 --> 01:41:47,723
Good night, Malcolm.

870
01:41:53,149 --> 01:41:55,481
Good night, sweetheart.
