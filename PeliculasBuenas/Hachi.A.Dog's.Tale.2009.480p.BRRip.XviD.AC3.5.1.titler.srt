1
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:36,743
So even if Columbus got lost and
wasn't the first to discover America,

2
00:00:36,826 --> 00:00:38,536
he's still my hero.

3
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,707
He was really brave to sail such a
tiny ship over a really big ocean,

4
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,293
and because of him, we get
Columbus Day off of school.

5
00:00:48,839 --> 00:00:52,968
Thank you, Heather.
Ronnie, tell us about your hero.

6
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:08,609
What's he writing?

7
00:01:09,318 --> 00:01:12,446
Hachiko was my grandfather
Wilson's dog.

8
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,078
Everyone called Hachi
a mystery dog

9
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:21,581
because they never really
knew where he came from.

10
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:26,002
Maybe Hachi escaped
from a dog pound.

11
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,089
Or maybe he jumped out
of somebody's car

12
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:32,592
from someplace far away like
Florida or New Jersey.

13
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,890
But no matter how,
Hachi was lost.

14
00:02:45,876 --> 00:02:48,003
Hey, it's a little puppy.

15
00:03:08,065 --> 00:03:10,026
But no matter how it happened,

16
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:14,822
a long time ago, in the town
my grandfather lived in,

17
00:03:14,906 --> 00:03:17,992
Hachi appeared
at the train station,

18
00:03:18,076 --> 00:03:20,620
and that's where
their story began.

19
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,122
No, it was great.
I loved the musicians.

20
00:04:03,205 --> 00:04:05,457
No, no, no,
I'll walk. I'll walk.

21
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:08,837
Yeah, I love you, too. Bye.

22
00:04:12,257 --> 00:04:16,136
Hey, buddy. Are you lost?
Come here.

23
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:23,852
You lost here, bud?

24
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,522
Someone must be
looking for you.

25
00:04:32,527 --> 00:04:34,529
Little guy was
wandering around.

26
00:04:34,613 --> 00:04:35,739
Really?
Out on the platform?

27
00:04:35,823 --> 00:04:37,449
On the platform, yeah.

28
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:38,993
Well, good for you
for finding him.

29
00:04:39,076 --> 00:04:40,411
Yeah.

30
00:04:40,494 --> 00:04:42,621
Well, I'll tell you what.

31
00:04:42,705 --> 00:04:44,498
This little crate was
out there. It was broken.

32
00:04:44,582 --> 00:04:46,125
I don't know
what's going on, but...

33
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,376
Oh.

34
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:49,587
- Anyhow, someone's gonna
be here for him. - Yeah.

35
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,755
So if you'll just hold him here.

36
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,798
You just hold him
till they come.

37
00:04:52,882 --> 00:04:54,842
No, I can't do that.

38
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:56,468
I can't do that, Professor.

39
00:04:56,551 --> 00:04:59,429
Well, he was out... No one's gonna
leave this dog. There's...

40
00:04:59,512 --> 00:05:01,973
No, I know that.
I know no one's gonna leave it.

41
00:05:02,056 --> 00:05:04,935
They'll be back for it.
So you take him with you,

42
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:07,480
and when anyone shows up,
I'll tell them that you have him.

43
00:05:07,563 --> 00:05:09,023
Someone's gonna be here.
They're gonna come for him.

44
00:05:09,106 --> 00:05:10,399
No, you don't understand.
Really, just, just...

45
00:05:10,483 --> 00:05:14,153
I'm gonna have to put this in here for
like the whole night if nobody comes.

46
00:05:14,236 --> 00:05:17,531
If they're not here, I'll lock him in here
and he'll be safe for the night,

47
00:05:17,615 --> 00:05:21,827
but all I can do is take him to
the pound in the morning.

48
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,886
Good thing it's Friday, you know?

49
00:05:37,969 --> 00:05:39,930
We'll find out where
you're headed.

50
00:05:40,555 --> 00:05:46,353
Until then, you can stay with me
in a nice warm house.

51
00:05:46,436 --> 00:05:49,189
How's that? Yeah?

52
00:06:57,343 --> 00:06:59,846
All right.
Here you go.

53
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,852
Sit right here. Sit right there.
Okay, yeah. Here you go.

54
00:07:06,936 --> 00:07:11,149
Okay. Stay, stay.
Chew on those. It's okay.

55
00:07:12,025 --> 00:07:13,109
Stay.

56
00:07:17,071 --> 00:07:18,281
Hello, handsome.

57
00:07:18,364 --> 00:07:19,741
Hi.

58
00:07:19,824 --> 00:07:22,076
Hi. How'd it go?

59
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,119
It was great.

60
00:07:23,202 --> 00:07:24,871
Good. You miss me?

61
00:07:24,954 --> 00:07:26,498
Not a bit. You?

62
00:07:26,582 --> 00:07:28,834
No. Didn't think
about you once.

63
00:07:31,295 --> 00:07:33,839
I have a little surprise.

64
00:07:33,922 --> 00:07:38,218
Yeah, well, I have a little
surprise for you, too.

65
00:07:38,302 --> 00:07:39,720
Come on. We have
some catching up to do.

66
00:07:39,803 --> 00:07:40,971
Yeah.

67
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:45,559
Catching up.
Okay, we'll catch up.

68
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,825
Did you hear something?

69
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:04,286
That was a branch
against the window.

70
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:24,557
I ran into this interesting
situation at the station tonight.

71
00:08:25,892 --> 00:08:30,105
Why don't you tell me about it in
the morning? How does that sound?

72
00:08:32,607 --> 00:08:34,442
What am I gonna do?

73
00:08:53,796 --> 00:08:54,839
Okay, okay.
Okay, it's all right.

74
00:08:54,922 --> 00:08:55,965
Parker!

75
00:08:56,048 --> 00:08:57,383
We had an agreement.
I know, I know.

76
00:08:57,466 --> 00:08:58,592
Or did you forget?

77
00:08:58,676 --> 00:09:00,136
No, I didn't forget.

78
00:09:00,219 --> 00:09:04,473
No, it was... He was at the train station.
I mean, just kind of lost.

79
00:09:04,557 --> 00:09:07,059
Carl was gonna send him to the pound
tomorrow and I thought...

80
00:09:07,143 --> 00:09:10,146
You just thought you'd bring him home
and talk me into keeping him, right?

81
00:09:10,229 --> 00:09:11,981
No, no, I don't want
to keep him. I don't.

82
00:09:12,064 --> 00:09:13,149
Tomorrow morning
I'm getting up,

83
00:09:13,232 --> 00:09:14,817
and I'll find out exactly
where he belongs, okay?

84
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,819
I promise you,
I will do that.

85
00:09:18,237 --> 00:09:20,574
All right.
This was Luke's stuff.

86
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:23,326
Okay, okay.

87
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,830
Okay, here you go.
In there.

88
00:09:27,747 --> 00:09:29,791
There you go.

89
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:34,254
Now look. Lots of good stuff here.

90
00:09:34,755 --> 00:09:37,340
That's warm.
You got that.

91
00:09:38,967 --> 00:09:40,051
It's pretty cold.

92
00:09:40,135 --> 00:09:43,013
You like this? Yeah?
This was Luke's favorite.

93
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:48,519
Okay. Okay,
here's your water.

94
00:09:49,979 --> 00:09:55,359
Some story you could tell, huh?
Couldn't you? Yeah.

95
00:09:56,235 --> 00:09:57,820
Okay, buddy.

96
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,994
That's better.

97
00:10:06,537 --> 00:10:08,164
Good night, buddy.

98
00:10:19,426 --> 00:10:22,513
You know, you're the one who
should be in the doghouse.

99
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:24,848
I promise I won't bite your toe.

100
00:10:34,191 --> 00:10:35,901
Puppy! Puppy!

101
00:10:35,984 --> 00:10:39,530
Hey, puppy! Puppy!
Puppy, come on! That's good.

102
00:10:41,406 --> 00:10:43,408
Good puppy.

103
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,412
Dad, I love him.

104
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:48,455
Does he have a name yet?

105
00:10:48,539 --> 00:10:51,542
Yes, he does.
"Temporary Guest. "

106
00:10:57,548 --> 00:10:59,258
You have to keep him.

107
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:02,761
Dad, the house feels so empty
since Luke's been gone.

108
00:11:04,346 --> 00:11:06,014
Ask your mother.

109
00:11:06,598 --> 00:11:08,225
- Mom?
- Yeah?

110
00:11:08,308 --> 00:11:10,310
Could you come here, please?

111
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:14,148
Look, he even
likes your music.

112
00:11:14,232 --> 00:11:15,358
Really!

113
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,861
I can't believe it!
This is a wonder dog!

114
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:19,654
I absolutely have
to keep this dog.

115
00:11:19,737 --> 00:11:21,364
No more dogs.

116
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:22,448
Don't encourage him.

117
00:11:22,532 --> 00:11:23,533
I won't.

118
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,201
You're so mean.

119
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:28,705
Dad, he's gonna
jump out of that. Here.

120
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:29,747
Oh, yeah, that's great.

121
00:11:29,831 --> 00:11:31,040
Try this.
I love it.

122
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:33,126
Does he fit?
I think so.

123
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:36,879
You in there, bud? Yeah!

124
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,592
No, that's good.
I like it. Great.

125
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,636
So, you saw
Michael last night?

126
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,804
Yeah.

127
00:11:43,887 --> 00:11:46,724
We drove over to the look-out,
watched the comets.

128
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,518
It was beautiful.

129
00:11:49,602 --> 00:11:51,228
Very romantic.

130
00:11:51,895 --> 00:11:53,480
It was.

131
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:56,191
Definitely happened more often...

132
00:11:57,568 --> 00:11:58,569
Whoa!

133
00:11:59,153 --> 00:12:00,404
Are you the...
Can I help you, pal?

134
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:04,408
Yeah, yeah. I just found this little guy
at the station last night.

135
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:05,910
Can you board him
until we find his owner?

136
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:07,202
Board him? No,
we can't board him.

137
00:12:07,286 --> 00:12:10,080
This isn't a boarding service.
It's a pound, pal.

138
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,878
Look, I just found him.
What am I gonna do with him?

139
00:12:17,505 --> 00:12:19,591
Let's see.

140
00:12:19,674 --> 00:12:20,759
Yeah.

141
00:12:20,842 --> 00:12:26,222
He's cute. That'll help with adoption,
but we give them two weeks.

142
00:12:27,515 --> 00:12:28,516
Come on.

143
00:12:29,017 --> 00:12:30,769
Two weeks?

144
00:12:30,852 --> 00:12:33,229
Yeah. We're packed.

145
00:12:35,023 --> 00:12:36,691
Excuse me.

146
00:12:40,488 --> 00:12:42,907
I'll call you next week then.
All right. Bye-bye.

147
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:43,991
Morning, Mary Anne.

148
00:12:44,075 --> 00:12:45,701
How you doing, Parker?

149
00:12:46,202 --> 00:12:49,038
I'm doing great. I was wondering if
I could ask you for a favor.

150
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:50,957
Sure, anything.

151
00:12:58,381 --> 00:13:00,716
Look at this!

152
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,886
Hey, little one!
Hello. Hello!

153
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,973
Oh, he's gorgeous!
Where'd you come from?

154
00:13:07,056 --> 00:13:08,642
He was wandering around
the station last night.

155
00:13:08,725 --> 00:13:09,768
Hi, sweetheart.

156
00:13:09,851 --> 00:13:11,311
I don't know,
it's very strange.

157
00:13:11,395 --> 00:13:13,897
Really?
He's adorable.

158
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,982
I just want to put
that up. Yeah?

159
00:13:15,065 --> 00:13:16,441
Okay, fine, fine.

160
00:13:16,525 --> 00:13:18,193
Window?
Hello. Yeah, right over there.

161
00:13:18,276 --> 00:13:19,903
Any one of those.

162
00:13:19,987 --> 00:13:22,906
Parker, this dog
is just fabulous.

163
00:13:23,031 --> 00:13:25,158
You wouldn't be interested,
would you?

164
00:13:25,242 --> 00:13:26,743
What, the puppy?

165
00:13:26,827 --> 00:13:28,453
A fine young
puppy like that.

166
00:13:28,537 --> 00:13:30,914
What do you think, Antonia?
New roommate?

167
00:13:32,124 --> 00:13:34,084
Oh! No! Antonia!

168
00:13:36,587 --> 00:13:38,256
Yeah, yeah.

169
00:13:49,433 --> 00:13:50,767
Morning, Mr. Professor.

170
00:13:50,851 --> 00:13:51,893
Jasjeet.

171
00:13:51,977 --> 00:13:55,355
One sugar, two cream, coming up.
Hey, what have you got there?

172
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:58,108
I got a new friend here.
You want a dog?

173
00:13:58,191 --> 00:14:00,027
I prefer cash.

174
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,487
He'd be a great guard dog
for you, wouldn't he?

175
00:14:02,571 --> 00:14:07,076
Guard dog to guard the hot dogs?
I don't think so.

176
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,287
I don't think so, either.

177
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,457
Seriously, man,
why you want a dog?

178
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,044
Every day you have to walk him,
feed him, clean him, pick up the poop.

179
00:14:16,127 --> 00:14:18,504
How many of these
can I have for him?

180
00:14:18,588 --> 00:14:20,381
On the house.

181
00:14:20,465 --> 00:14:22,216
Too much trouble.
Yeah, you're right.

182
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,342
Thank you, Jas.

183
00:14:23,426 --> 00:14:24,677
My pleasure.

184
00:14:25,887 --> 00:14:26,888
Hey, any news?

185
00:14:26,971 --> 00:14:29,390
No. Nobody came,
nobody showed up, nobody called.

186
00:14:29,474 --> 00:14:30,641
Nobody?

187
00:14:32,101 --> 00:14:34,605
Strange. Really strange.

188
00:14:35,606 --> 00:14:36,857
Can you hold him a second?

189
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,983
Yeah.

190
00:14:38,066 --> 00:14:39,651
You're cute.

191
00:14:40,194 --> 00:14:43,030
I made up some flyers.
Would you put that up for me?

192
00:14:43,113 --> 00:14:44,156
Come on.

193
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:46,617
All right, I'll put them up for you.

194
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,076
What a sweetheart you are.

195
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,578
I know, I know, I know.

196
00:14:49,661 --> 00:14:50,704
Come on.

197
00:14:50,788 --> 00:14:53,207
He really likes
being in the bag.

198
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,374
Thanks.

199
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,460
Professor,
no dogs on the train.

200
00:14:56,543 --> 00:14:57,711
No dogs on the train.

201
00:14:57,795 --> 00:14:59,171
Thank you.

202
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,197
Okay, hold on a second.
Let me try something.

203
00:16:04,281 --> 00:16:06,658
We skip the repeat
of the first section

204
00:16:06,741 --> 00:16:08,535
and go directly
to the lyrical section.

205
00:16:08,618 --> 00:16:09,911
Okay.
Let's try that.

206
00:16:09,995 --> 00:16:12,664
But just it means you've got to
build up quicker. You don't have to...

207
00:16:12,747 --> 00:16:14,207
And when we get
to the lyrical section,

208
00:16:14,291 --> 00:16:17,210
just big breaths,
big breaths.

209
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,183
Don't forget to breathe.

210
00:16:50,285 --> 00:16:51,494
Hello.

211
00:17:01,631 --> 00:17:03,049
That's great.

212
00:17:06,302 --> 00:17:09,513
You don't want a puppy,
do you? You want a puppy?

213
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:19,023
This was the only thing
left on the crate.

214
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:20,858
Mmm. "Yamanashi. "

215
00:17:20,942 --> 00:17:22,234
That's all I can read.

216
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:23,361
What's that?

217
00:17:23,445 --> 00:17:25,822
It's a part of central Japan.

218
00:17:27,741 --> 00:17:28,909
No ordinary dog, Parker.

219
00:17:28,992 --> 00:17:30,035
No.

220
00:17:30,118 --> 00:17:33,288
It's an Akita, or Akita,
as you'd say.

221
00:17:33,997 --> 00:17:35,374
It's a very special breed.

222
00:17:35,457 --> 00:17:36,500
Yeah?

223
00:17:40,254 --> 00:17:42,005
What is that?
Hachi.

224
00:17:42,089 --> 00:17:43,966
What?
It's Japanese for "Eight. "

225
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:45,509
Number of good fortune.

226
00:17:45,676 --> 00:17:48,095
Oh. Good fortune.

227
00:17:48,178 --> 00:17:49,763
Very nice.

228
00:17:49,846 --> 00:17:52,016
Hachi. Hachi.

229
00:17:52,517 --> 00:17:53,601
That's a good name.
I like that.

230
00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:56,229
He might have been
born eighth in the litter.

231
00:17:56,312 --> 00:17:57,939
Spiritual significance
in number eight

232
00:17:58,022 --> 00:18:00,525
reaches up to heaven,
comes down to Earth.

233
00:18:00,608 --> 00:18:01,693
Hmm.

234
00:18:03,111 --> 00:18:05,238
So what do you think?
Do you want him?

235
00:18:05,321 --> 00:18:06,531
Me?

236
00:18:06,656 --> 00:18:09,450
No, I think he's made his choice.

237
00:18:09,534 --> 00:18:10,743
Meaning what?

238
00:18:11,202 --> 00:18:14,539
Well, meaning he's your problem,
not mine, brother.

239
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,208
You're not a problem, are you?

240
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:18,543
Well...

241
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,050
Whether you found him
or he found you, who's to say?

242
00:18:26,135 --> 00:18:27,803
It's meant to be.

243
00:18:27,886 --> 00:18:33,058
He was also saying that the shoguns
bred these Akitas for combat and hunting.

244
00:18:33,517 --> 00:18:37,229
So I guess in a way,
they're kind of dog royalty.

245
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:42,651
Did Ken give you any ideas where you
could find this royal dog a home?

246
00:18:44,403 --> 00:18:46,739
I put up 10 flyers already.

247
00:18:48,073 --> 00:18:50,577
You know, someone's
going to claim Hachi.

248
00:18:51,202 --> 00:18:52,704
Who's Hachi?

249
00:18:52,787 --> 00:18:54,080
This...

250
00:18:55,457 --> 00:18:57,917
It's what was on his collar.
That's the symbol.

251
00:18:58,001 --> 00:18:59,377
You named him?
No, I didn't...

252
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:00,503
Parker, you want
to keep him.

253
00:19:00,587 --> 00:19:01,921
No, I do not.
You do. You do.

254
00:19:02,005 --> 00:19:03,381
I don't want to keep him.

255
00:19:03,465 --> 00:19:05,050
Admit it. Admit it. You do.

256
00:19:05,091 --> 00:19:06,634
You want to keep him.
I wasn't even thinking about it.

257
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,761
Yes.

258
00:19:09,262 --> 00:19:10,305
Hachi?

259
00:19:12,974 --> 00:19:14,476
Where'd you go?

260
00:19:19,774 --> 00:19:20,858
Oh, no!

261
00:19:20,941 --> 00:19:21,984
Parker, that's months
of hard work!

262
00:19:22,068 --> 00:19:23,319
Cate, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

263
00:19:23,402 --> 00:19:25,112
I want him to stay out
there all night, Parker.

264
00:19:25,196 --> 00:19:26,864
Yes, yes. He's not coming back in.
Do you hear me?

265
00:19:26,947 --> 00:19:28,032
I hear you.
End of discussion.

266
00:19:28,115 --> 00:19:31,994
I hear you. I heard you before,
I hear you right now.

267
00:19:47,635 --> 00:19:49,637
Four months of work.

268
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:08,697
Hachi.

269
00:20:10,408 --> 00:20:12,493
Come on, buddy.
Come on, here.

270
00:20:12,576 --> 00:20:13,577
Yeah.

271
00:20:13,994 --> 00:20:16,248
Yeah, you're coming inside.

272
00:20:19,501 --> 00:20:20,836
Let's go.

273
00:20:33,849 --> 00:20:35,225
Okay.

274
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,979
See if I can find you here.

275
00:20:40,438 --> 00:20:43,109
Yeah, there you are.

276
00:20:45,027 --> 00:20:49,740
Your bloodline goes back at least
4, 000 years, maybe much more.

277
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:53,870
Yeah.
What else we got here?

278
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,042
Yeah.

279
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,253
You like that?

280
00:21:02,753 --> 00:21:06,340
It says the first partnership

281
00:21:06,424 --> 00:21:10,094
between man and animals
was with you.

282
00:21:10,678 --> 00:21:12,055
Did you know about that?

283
00:21:12,139 --> 00:21:15,976
Did you know that already?
You did, didn't you? Yeah, think you did.

284
00:21:18,687 --> 00:21:20,439
Shut this down.

285
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:24,318
Let's see if we can
settle you down now.

286
00:21:26,987 --> 00:21:30,616
Hey, this looks
pretty good, huh?

287
00:21:31,742 --> 00:21:34,661
All right, stay there.
Stay there now. Okay?

288
00:21:34,745 --> 00:21:36,580
All right, stay.

289
00:21:45,131 --> 00:21:47,467
Stay. Stay there.

290
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,555
At some point he establishes inside
so that the Braves hitters...

291
00:21:52,639 --> 00:21:53,681
Okay.

292
00:21:53,765 --> 00:21:55,517
...don't lean out there
and start shooting the ball

293
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,102
into right field, which is what they
did in Game 2.

294
00:22:02,607 --> 00:22:04,192
I'll just stay for a little bit.

295
00:22:04,275 --> 00:22:06,069
Two and one for him.

296
00:22:10,866 --> 00:22:12,576
Runner at second, two out.

297
00:22:14,745 --> 00:22:18,666
It stays fair, Lopez,
very good play to end the inning.

298
00:22:51,323 --> 00:22:52,908
Excuse me.

299
00:22:53,325 --> 00:22:55,077
Don't...

300
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,245
I was just coming up.

301
00:22:56,328 --> 00:22:58,414
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

302
00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:07,841
Just one night. One night only, okay?
Be a good boy.

303
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,679
Stay there.
All right, you'll be fine.

304
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:18,226
I can't believe it.

305
00:23:18,977 --> 00:23:20,854
He loves the Yankees.

306
00:23:21,354 --> 00:23:24,024
No, really? Really?
He does.

307
00:23:24,733 --> 00:23:26,318
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

308
00:23:26,401 --> 00:23:28,945
All right, Hachi,
this is what we're gonna do.

309
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:32,073
This is a ball.
Ball, throw.

310
00:23:32,157 --> 00:23:33,283
You go get it,
you bring it back, okay?

311
00:23:34,452 --> 00:23:37,455
Okay? You ready?
Go get it.

312
00:23:38,205 --> 00:23:38,998
Go get it.

313
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:42,168
No, no, no, the ball.

314
00:23:42,251 --> 00:23:46,130
Hach. Hachi. Hachi,
Hachi, Hachi. Hey, Hachi.

315
00:23:46,213 --> 00:23:47,214
Hachi.

316
00:23:47,882 --> 00:23:50,968
Now I'll throw it, you bring it back, okay?
Here we go.

317
00:23:52,553 --> 00:23:53,721
Go get it.

318
00:23:56,223 --> 00:23:58,643
Hachi. No, no, no.
Get the ball.

319
00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:02,689
Hachi, come here.
Hachi, come on.

320
00:24:03,106 --> 00:24:06,318
Go get it. Come here, come here,
come here. Hachi, Hachi.

321
00:24:08,153 --> 00:24:09,988
See the ball? See the ball?
Come here.

322
00:24:10,072 --> 00:24:12,449
Hachi. Hachi, come here.

323
00:24:12,532 --> 00:24:14,826
Come here. You can do this,
I know you can.

324
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,495
I just think you're being
a little tough about it.

325
00:24:16,578 --> 00:24:20,082
The clog's in a fix and Dad's just
trying to do the right thing.

326
00:24:20,248 --> 00:24:22,334
Okay. Okay.

327
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:24,252
Mom.

328
00:24:24,836 --> 00:24:27,839
Hachi, Hachi. The ball.
Ball, ball, ball.

329
00:24:27,923 --> 00:24:29,758
Get the ball.
Come on now.

330
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,349
He's lost it.

331
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,394
Hachi. Hey, hey.

332
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:41,270
Hello?

333
00:24:42,188 --> 00:24:45,525
The puppy flyers, yes.
Are you the clog's owner?

334
00:24:48,277 --> 00:24:50,530
No, no one's
come forward yet.

335
00:24:50,613 --> 00:24:53,449
We just want to make sure
the dog has a good home.

336
00:24:54,867 --> 00:24:59,039
Could I get your number?
I'm sure my husband would want to call you.

337
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:02,251
Hold on a second,
I need to find a pen. Hold on, okay?

338
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:09,258
Hachi, Hachi, Hachi. Come here.

339
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:13,303
Hachi. Good.

340
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:14,430
Hachi.

341
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,646
Hi, Hachi. Hachi.

342
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,233
Hey, Dad,
let me get a picture.

343
00:25:27,316 --> 00:25:28,360
Hello?

344
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:29,611
Hey, boy.

345
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,657
The clog's already been taken.

346
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:38,996
Yes. I'm really sorry.

347
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:43,500
Hachi.

348
00:26:07,108 --> 00:26:10,612
Whoa! No, no, no!
Hach. Hach. Hach, Hach.

349
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:15,783
Okay, come on. Come on, take it in.
Take it in.

350
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:19,621
No, you can't go. Can't go.
I gotta go to work.

351
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:21,873
See you back here tonight.
Bye.

352
00:26:58,411 --> 00:27:00,247
Good morning, Mr. Professor.
Good morning.

353
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,665
You're a little late today.

354
00:27:01,748 --> 00:27:02,916
Already waiting.
Thank you.

355
00:27:02,999 --> 00:27:04,793
One sugar, two cream.

356
00:27:05,085 --> 00:27:08,338
Last call for the 8:32
express to Providence.

357
00:27:08,421 --> 00:27:11,925
The final boarding call for the
8:32 express to Providence.

358
00:27:23,563 --> 00:27:25,565
Excuse me, excuse me.

359
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,652
Hachi!

360
00:27:31,153 --> 00:27:32,446
What are you doing here?

361
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:35,074
What are you doing here?
What are you doing?

362
00:27:35,449 --> 00:27:37,034
You gotta go
home, okay? Go.

363
00:27:37,118 --> 00:27:40,663
No, go home.
Go home, go on.

364
00:27:41,247 --> 00:27:43,082
I gotta get
on the train. Go, go.

365
00:27:43,165 --> 00:27:45,293
Okay, come on. Gotta go home.
Come on.

366
00:27:45,376 --> 00:27:46,878
Professor, you
want me to hold it?

367
00:27:46,961 --> 00:27:48,045
Yeah, could you?

368
00:27:48,129 --> 00:27:49,213
Thirty seconds.

369
00:27:49,297 --> 00:27:50,465
Thanks.

370
00:27:52,634 --> 00:27:55,345
Go home, go home.
Okay, go. Go on, go home.

371
00:27:55,429 --> 00:27:58,515
Hey, Chuck, we're holding it up
for a moment, all right?

372
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:02,185
Go home. Go home!
Go, go, go!

373
00:28:02,269 --> 00:28:04,396
Go on home. Come on, Hachi,
go on home.

374
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:05,772
Go home, go on.

375
00:28:05,856 --> 00:28:07,149
He's really got him
trained, doesn't he?

376
00:28:07,232 --> 00:28:08,400
Good boy!

377
00:28:11,111 --> 00:28:13,155
Professor?

378
00:28:18,995 --> 00:28:20,580
Okay. Thanks, Carl.

379
00:28:20,663 --> 00:28:22,164
You sure?
Yeah, yeah.

380
00:28:22,247 --> 00:28:23,999
All right, let her go.
Let her go.

381
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,628
Want me to call
you a cab?

382
00:28:27,711 --> 00:28:30,213
No, I'll walk him home.
It's all right.

383
00:28:39,765 --> 00:28:41,516
Oh, man!

384
00:28:47,065 --> 00:28:48,441
Parker?

385
00:28:48,524 --> 00:28:49,651
I thought you left for work.

386
00:28:49,734 --> 00:28:50,985
I did.

387
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:52,612
You're gardening now?

388
00:28:52,695 --> 00:28:54,739
He got out.
I missed the train.

389
00:28:54,822 --> 00:28:55,907
Oh!

390
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:57,033
Don't say it. No.
Here.

391
00:28:57,116 --> 00:28:58,117
I know what
you're gonna say.

392
00:28:58,201 --> 00:28:59,452
Now here, let me do this.

393
00:28:59,535 --> 00:29:02,246
You're gonna get filthy.
I'll fill it in. Get the next train.

394
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,207
Okay. Thanks.

395
00:29:06,793 --> 00:29:08,795
And you, you stay.

396
00:29:08,878 --> 00:29:09,963
He will.

397
00:29:10,296 --> 00:29:12,632
See you tonight. Bye.

398
00:29:58,763 --> 00:30:01,641
Here's a treat.
Here's a treat.

399
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:09,649
All right, okay. Okay, just one more.
Just one more. That's it.

400
00:30:09,733 --> 00:30:11,735
Hold on, hold on.

401
00:30:14,613 --> 00:30:16,866
Okay?

402
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:18,409
Is that good?

403
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:20,161
Okay.

404
00:30:20,244 --> 00:30:23,956
All right, all right.
This is the last one.

405
00:30:24,415 --> 00:30:27,126
There you go.
Good boy, Hachi.

406
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:31,005
All right.

407
00:30:35,342 --> 00:30:37,595
Okay. One last one.

408
00:30:39,263 --> 00:30:41,099
There you go.

409
00:30:58,658 --> 00:31:02,245
That's great. That is really great,
everybody. I'm proud of you.

410
00:31:05,207 --> 00:31:06,500
Sorry I was late again.

411
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:07,876
All right?
I'm off the hook?

412
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:09,002
Yeah.

413
00:31:09,086 --> 00:31:10,088
Good. Thank you.

414
00:31:46,332 --> 00:31:50,545
Hey, Hachi.
What are you doing here?

415
00:32:36,801 --> 00:32:39,137
Hi. Hey, Hachi!

416
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:43,016
Hey! How you doing?
What are you doing here?

417
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:44,726
Bedridge Station.

418
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:47,353
Look at you!

419
00:32:47,437 --> 00:32:50,607
Yes. Yes, ma'am,
we got one at 7:30.

420
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:51,691
You okay?

421
00:32:53,401 --> 00:32:54,360
He been here all day?

422
00:32:54,444 --> 00:32:56,404
No, no, no. He just showed
up two minutes ago.

423
00:32:56,487 --> 00:32:57,530
He went right there.

424
00:32:57,614 --> 00:32:59,073
You're kidding.

425
00:32:59,157 --> 00:33:00,617
Have you seen Cate?

426
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,243
I haven't seen her.

427
00:33:02,785 --> 00:33:05,831
All right. Okay.

428
00:33:05,915 --> 00:33:07,499
I don't know,
I guess we'll go home.

429
00:33:07,583 --> 00:33:08,959
All right. Okay.

430
00:33:09,585 --> 00:33:11,462
You son of a gun.

431
00:33:11,629 --> 00:33:12,963
Come on.

432
00:33:13,297 --> 00:33:14,632
Come on, boy.

433
00:33:15,466 --> 00:33:17,343
Come on. Come on.

434
00:33:19,762 --> 00:33:20,763
Mom?

435
00:33:20,846 --> 00:33:22,932
Yeah, sweetie,
I'm in here.

436
00:33:23,682 --> 00:33:24,725
Hey, hi.

437
00:33:24,808 --> 00:33:25,893
Hi.

438
00:33:25,976 --> 00:33:27,770
I got the chips.
Hi, honey. Oh, thanks.

439
00:33:27,853 --> 00:33:29,104
Hey, Mrs. Wilson,
good to see you.

440
00:33:29,188 --> 00:33:30,231
Hi. Oh, Michael,
nice to see you.

441
00:33:30,314 --> 00:33:31,983
Call me Cate.
Okay.

442
00:33:32,067 --> 00:33:33,276
Thank you.
Thank you.

443
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,611
Everything looks delicious.

444
00:33:34,694 --> 00:33:36,029
Oh, good.
Yeah, that's a great spread.

445
00:33:36,112 --> 00:33:38,073
Why don't you take this to Dad?
Sure.

446
00:33:38,156 --> 00:33:39,532
He's out back.
Let's get this started.

447
00:33:39,616 --> 00:33:41,576
The grill's ready?
It's getting there, yeah.

448
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,953
Nice to see you.
Should I chop these?

449
00:33:43,036 --> 00:33:44,913
You, too.
Yeah, that'd be great, hon.

450
00:33:44,996 --> 00:33:45,997
Let's see...

451
00:33:47,874 --> 00:33:51,294
You know, I actually took guitar lessons
for a little bit, when I was a kid.

452
00:33:51,378 --> 00:33:52,420
Did you?

453
00:33:52,504 --> 00:33:55,215
Yeah, like when I was
nine or 10 years old.

454
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:59,302
I had to stop because my brother
slammed my fingers in the car door.

455
00:33:59,928 --> 00:34:02,723
I mean, he always said it was an
accident, but after that I just...

456
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:05,768
I don't know, I stopped practicing.
I wish I didn't, though,

457
00:34:05,851 --> 00:34:07,061
because I really...

458
00:34:07,144 --> 00:34:10,439
It's just, I love music, you know, and
I have so much respect for musicians

459
00:34:10,523 --> 00:34:12,273
and people who
play instruments...

460
00:34:12,357 --> 00:34:14,359
Michael, do you
love my daughter?

461
00:34:17,195 --> 00:34:19,406
Yes, sir. Yes, I do.

462
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:24,536
Well, that's good because that's what
you want to remember on the bad days.

463
00:34:26,454 --> 00:34:27,789
Right.

464
00:34:30,167 --> 00:34:33,921
Hachi, this is Michael.
Michael, Hachi.

465
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,423
Pleased to meet you.

466
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,847
Hachi. Hey, you wanna play
a little catch?

467
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:47,143
Yeah? Ready?
Okay, go get the ball. Go get it!

468
00:34:47,226 --> 00:34:50,646
There it is! Get the ball.
It's right there. Go!

469
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:52,106
Hachi, go get it.

470
00:34:52,189 --> 00:34:55,151
Go! Go get the ball.
Go get it.

471
00:34:55,234 --> 00:34:56,944
Michael, you want
to get that ball back,

472
00:34:57,029 --> 00:34:59,990
you're gonna have to get it yourself.
Hachi doesn't fetch.

473
00:35:00,073 --> 00:35:01,658
He doesn't do it.

474
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:04,911
Okay.

475
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:07,956
Are you all right? Are you okay?
Totally good.

476
00:35:08,081 --> 00:35:09,875
Totally good.
Keep playing. Honey, are you okay?

477
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:11,084
Are you okay?
Totally.

478
00:35:11,168 --> 00:35:12,502
Are you sure?
I'm gonna get the ball.

479
00:35:12,586 --> 00:35:14,087
Okay.
I'm good.

480
00:35:15,756 --> 00:35:16,840
Look at that.

481
00:35:16,923 --> 00:35:17,966
Are you really okay?

482
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,801
Don't let me disrupt the game.
Okay. Okay.

483
00:35:19,885 --> 00:35:21,386
Are you all right?
Are you okay?

484
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,597
He was just distracting you there.
Okay.

485
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,726
If I throw the ball just one foot,
you go get it, okay?

486
00:35:26,809 --> 00:35:28,853
Really? Even if I just
toss it right here,

487
00:35:28,936 --> 00:35:30,980
he's not gonna
get it? You're not?

488
00:35:52,293 --> 00:35:53,711
- Fetch?
- Fetch, right.

489
00:35:53,795 --> 00:35:56,507
I throw, he brings back.
He won't do it.

490
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:58,509
Not Akitas, Parker.

491
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:00,677
What, they have something
against fetching?

492
00:36:00,761 --> 00:36:04,598
No. You want a dog that fetches, you
get a collie, you get a springer spaniel.

493
00:36:04,681 --> 00:36:07,226
No, Hachi's fine
with me. I'm okay.

494
00:36:07,309 --> 00:36:11,230
Well, good, because Akitas are not
into people-pleasing.

495
00:36:11,313 --> 00:36:12,314
What are they into?

496
00:36:12,398 --> 00:36:15,901
He comes to the train because he
has a special connection with you.

497
00:36:15,984 --> 00:36:20,447
"Here, buddy. Go get that ball. "
Why would he do that?

498
00:36:20,531 --> 00:36:23,910
For fun?
For a cookie?

499
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:26,830
Because it'd make
me happy, basically.

500
00:36:27,455 --> 00:36:29,082
They can't be bought.

501
00:36:29,165 --> 00:36:30,583
They're Japanese,
not American.

502
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:32,752
Give me a break, man.

503
00:36:32,836 --> 00:36:36,965
Well, if he's gonna fetch,
it'll be for a very special reason.

504
00:36:39,134 --> 00:36:40,844
I'll find a reason.

505
00:36:43,304 --> 00:36:45,765
No, no, no. No, Hach, come on.
You can't go.

506
00:36:45,849 --> 00:36:48,434
I'm sorry, but you can't go.
Come on.

507
00:36:48,518 --> 00:36:49,894
Come on.

508
00:36:51,188 --> 00:36:52,940
No, stay.

509
00:37:03,367 --> 00:37:06,495
Okay, come on. Come on.
It's all right, come on.

510
00:37:06,579 --> 00:37:08,788
Come on, come on.

511
00:37:08,872 --> 00:37:11,291
Hey, Hach! Hach!
Hach! Hach!

512
00:37:11,374 --> 00:37:12,876
Come on, come on.

513
00:37:15,378 --> 00:37:17,338
Hey, Hach. Hach!

514
00:37:20,634 --> 00:37:24,388
Let's go. Come on.
Come on! Come on!

515
00:37:26,932 --> 00:37:28,434
Good morning, Milton.
Morning. How are you?

516
00:37:28,517 --> 00:37:30,311
How you doing today?

517
00:37:30,394 --> 00:37:31,979
Myra.
Morning, Parker.

518
00:37:32,062 --> 00:37:33,314
Stay out of the sun.

519
00:37:45,117 --> 00:37:46,619
Good morning, Mr. Professor.

520
00:37:46,702 --> 00:37:48,079
Hey, good morning.
Good morning, Parker.

521
00:37:48,163 --> 00:37:49,623
He won't bite, huh?
Thank you.

522
00:37:49,706 --> 00:37:51,499
No, no,
he's doing really good.

523
00:37:51,583 --> 00:37:52,918
Come on, boy.

524
00:37:53,793 --> 00:37:55,879
All right, I want you
to go straight home now.

525
00:37:55,962 --> 00:37:58,673
Go straight home.
You'll do that for me?

526
00:37:58,757 --> 00:38:01,593
I'll see you here tonight.
Go ahead. Go on home.

527
00:38:03,136 --> 00:38:05,931
Good boy. Good boy!

528
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,271
Great day,
Carl, isn't it?

529
00:38:13,355 --> 00:38:15,190
Have a good one, Professor.

530
00:38:24,116 --> 00:38:25,743
Hachi.

531
00:38:26,619 --> 00:38:30,206
There, yes.
Don't tell Milton.

532
00:38:30,289 --> 00:38:31,290
Yeah.

533
00:39:05,033 --> 00:39:08,287
Hey, Hachi. Good dog!

534
00:39:09,538 --> 00:39:11,331
What a good boy.

535
00:39:12,582 --> 00:39:15,461
Okay, come on. Let's go home.
Come on.

536
00:39:15,545 --> 00:39:17,046
Come on.

537
00:39:24,178 --> 00:39:25,513
That's good.

538
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:29,350
Hey, Hach.

539
00:39:35,023 --> 00:39:37,442
Come on, come on.
Let's go. Let's go!

540
00:39:37,525 --> 00:39:40,069
Some more champagne?
Is there anymore champagne?

541
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,917
On three. One, two, three.

542
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,086
Hachi!

543
00:40:46,137 --> 00:40:47,347
That's great, Jake.

544
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,473
Thanks.

545
00:40:48,556 --> 00:40:49,849
Cate.

546
00:40:49,933 --> 00:40:52,394
You seen Hachi?
He wasn't at the station.

547
00:40:52,852 --> 00:40:57,190
No, I haven't seen him
since this morning. Come here.

548
00:41:00,777 --> 00:41:02,278
Look at her.

549
00:41:05,156 --> 00:41:08,119
Can you believe they had
her covered for 30 years?

550
00:41:09,745 --> 00:41:11,288
Isn't she beautiful?

551
00:41:12,123 --> 00:41:13,707
Yeah, she is.

552
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:17,878
I'm falling behind schedule.

553
00:41:17,962 --> 00:41:19,463
Oh, you'll catch up.

554
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:22,049
Just think about opening night.
That'll freak you out.

555
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:27,930
The young soloist steps downstage,
sings from La Boheme

556
00:41:28,806 --> 00:41:30,599
and then dance, of course.

557
00:41:30,683 --> 00:41:35,897
Following that, rock, rap, hip-hop,
jazz and Hamlet.

558
00:41:36,648 --> 00:41:37,858
And then, of course,

559
00:41:37,941 --> 00:41:41,737
the entire town is going to rise up,
standing ovation.

560
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,196
The place is going crazy.

561
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,574
Mayor sees you down there,
he pulls you up onstage,

562
00:41:45,657 --> 00:41:49,202
puts you center stage and thanks
you for making it all possible.

563
00:41:49,995 --> 00:41:51,413
Yeah?
Yeah.

564
00:41:51,496 --> 00:41:52,789
I like it.

565
00:41:55,375 --> 00:41:56,626
Hachi!

566
00:41:59,087 --> 00:42:00,297
Come on, boy.

567
00:42:06,471 --> 00:42:07,680
Hachi!

568
00:42:13,227 --> 00:42:14,520
Hachi.

569
00:42:18,024 --> 00:42:19,984
What are you doing here?

570
00:42:27,366 --> 00:42:28,659
It's all right.

571
00:42:32,998 --> 00:42:35,375
Stay, stay.
Hachi, stay.

572
00:42:42,508 --> 00:42:45,886
Okay, go, go away.
Go on, get out.

573
00:42:49,014 --> 00:42:50,557
Get! Get!

574
00:42:51,642 --> 00:42:54,186
Get out of here.
Get out! Get out!

575
00:43:05,948 --> 00:43:07,199
Hachi.

576
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,624
Come on, come on, come on!

577
00:43:15,791 --> 00:43:16,833
Whoa!

578
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,351
Parker?

579
00:43:49,409 --> 00:43:50,952
We got skunked.

580
00:43:52,245 --> 00:43:53,872
You want to come in with us?

581
00:43:53,955 --> 00:43:55,248
No, I'm gonna pass.

582
00:43:57,208 --> 00:43:58,627
Okay.

583
00:44:04,091 --> 00:44:06,802
You better open a window
before you go to sleep.

584
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,889
You really think
we smell that bad?

585
00:44:12,641 --> 00:44:14,226
You're probably right.

586
00:44:20,149 --> 00:44:21,317
Mom!

587
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,573
Hi, honey. What's up?

588
00:44:29,743 --> 00:44:31,995
I have to tell you something.

589
00:44:33,455 --> 00:44:34,414
Guess what?

590
00:44:34,497 --> 00:44:35,582
What?

591
00:44:35,832 --> 00:44:37,000
Okay, wait.
What?

592
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:38,793
Just wait. Wait.
What?

593
00:44:41,504 --> 00:44:42,923
See anything different?

594
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:44,674
No.

595
00:44:44,758 --> 00:44:45,800
Yes!

596
00:44:48,345 --> 00:44:50,221
Oh, sweetheart!

597
00:44:51,514 --> 00:44:53,600
That's so wonderful!

598
00:44:53,683 --> 00:44:54,809
Oh, I have to call
Grandma right away.

599
00:44:54,893 --> 00:44:56,187
Okay.

600
00:44:56,646 --> 00:44:57,730
Where's Dad?

601
00:44:57,813 --> 00:44:59,190
Out there, as usual.

602
00:45:01,067 --> 00:45:02,985
Daddy.

603
00:45:05,404 --> 00:45:06,572
Dad.

604
00:45:10,242 --> 00:45:11,661
Dad, what are you doing?

605
00:45:11,744 --> 00:45:13,496
It's a full-body massage.

606
00:45:13,579 --> 00:45:15,456
I'm following the book.

607
00:45:15,539 --> 00:45:17,166
See...
You're gonna be a grandpa.

608
00:45:17,249 --> 00:45:19,126
You gotta get really deep down in
there, in the muscle.

609
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:20,670
Dad. Dad.

610
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:26,301
Michael and I are having a baby.
I'm pregnant.

611
00:45:28,011 --> 00:45:29,012
You...

612
00:45:29,805 --> 00:45:31,598
Jeez! You're...

613
00:45:33,308 --> 00:45:34,351
Really?

614
00:45:34,434 --> 00:45:35,477
Yes.

615
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,562
You're having a baby?

616
00:45:43,235 --> 00:45:44,236
I'm gonna be a grandpa.

617
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:45,487
Yes.

618
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:48,407
Catie!
I can't believe this!

619
00:45:49,241 --> 00:45:52,370
This is terrific, honey.
I'm so happy for you.

620
00:45:54,247 --> 00:45:56,373
Hi, sweetie.
Hey, Mom.

621
00:45:56,456 --> 00:45:58,792
I'm sorry I'm late.

622
00:45:58,875 --> 00:45:59,835
What you got?

623
00:45:59,918 --> 00:46:02,003
I've got all kinds of
healthy things for you.

624
00:46:02,087 --> 00:46:06,258
Fresh-cut vegetables, raspberries,
pita with hummus and sprouts.

625
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,759
You know, when
I was carrying you,

626
00:46:07,843 --> 00:46:11,346
I was sending out your father for pizza
with red peppers and double anchovies

627
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:14,182
for weeks straight.
He couldn't even watch me eat it.

628
00:46:16,476 --> 00:46:18,812
Can you believe you and Dad have been
together for 25 years?

629
00:46:18,895 --> 00:46:21,315
We've been together longer
than we've been apart.

630
00:46:21,399 --> 00:46:22,817
Wow.

631
00:46:26,779 --> 00:46:31,367
Dad said after your first date, by the time
he got back to the car,

632
00:46:31,451 --> 00:46:34,454
he missed you so much
he went back for you.

633
00:46:34,537 --> 00:46:37,039
I know. I was watching
from the window.

634
00:46:37,874 --> 00:46:40,001
When I saw him
come up the walk again,

635
00:46:40,084 --> 00:46:42,712
I almost ran out the door
and jumped into his arms.

636
00:46:42,795 --> 00:46:43,796
You should have.

637
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,881
I know.

638
00:46:44,964 --> 00:46:47,008
But I always stop
and think too much.

639
00:46:47,091 --> 00:46:48,801
That's true. You do.

640
00:46:48,886 --> 00:46:49,928
Don't do that.

641
00:46:50,012 --> 00:46:51,513
Okay.
Okay.

642
00:46:53,807 --> 00:46:56,852
Hey, Hach. Come on, Hachi, come on.
Come on, come on.

643
00:47:04,067 --> 00:47:06,820
Yeah! Come on,
let's go home. Let's go home.

644
00:47:06,904 --> 00:47:08,363
Hey, Mr. Professor.

645
00:47:08,447 --> 00:47:10,032
Good night, Parker.

646
00:47:10,115 --> 00:47:11,116
Good night, Mary Anne.

647
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,242
How'd you train
that dog to do that?

648
00:47:12,326 --> 00:47:14,203
That's amazing. Every day.

649
00:47:15,287 --> 00:47:16,497
Let's go.

650
00:47:26,007 --> 00:47:27,342
Parker?

651
00:47:33,014 --> 00:47:34,015
Parker?

652
00:47:37,852 --> 00:47:38,853
Parker?

653
00:47:52,576 --> 00:47:54,161
You're overdressed.

654
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:02,044
Well, there's something I might be
able to do about that.

655
00:48:03,629 --> 00:48:05,047
Thank you.

656
00:48:06,924 --> 00:48:09,677
Anything else
you require, madam?

657
00:48:10,886 --> 00:48:12,888
That depends on
what you've got.

658
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:16,268
Everything.

659
00:48:16,726 --> 00:48:18,562
Everything?

660
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,199
Yeah, everything.

661
00:48:31,741 --> 00:48:33,326
Okay.

662
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:48,092
You've had to put up
with a lot. I know that.

663
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,053
I don't know if I've
ever thanked you.

664
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,898
You know how
much I love you?

665
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,777
And I love you.

666
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,530
Good.
Yeah.

667
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,996
Especially when you don't smell
like a dog or a skunk.

668
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:21,584
Which isn't very often,
actually, so I should worry about...

669
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,878
Well, it happens
more often...

670
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,104
I love you.
Love you, too.

671
00:49:41,188 --> 00:49:43,148
I'll call you later.
Bye-bye.

672
00:49:46,652 --> 00:49:48,403
Okay, Hachi, come on.

673
00:49:53,575 --> 00:49:55,077
Hachi, come on.

674
00:49:57,829 --> 00:50:00,332
Come on now. What's wrong with you?
Come on.

675
00:50:02,542 --> 00:50:03,710
What is it?

676
00:50:08,173 --> 00:50:11,511
Come here, come here.
Come on.

677
00:50:12,345 --> 00:50:14,514
Come here.
What is with you?

678
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:16,724
Come here now.
You got a problem?

679
00:50:17,266 --> 00:50:18,851
Come here.

680
00:50:18,935 --> 00:50:21,479
You're all right.
What's going on, huh?

681
00:50:24,107 --> 00:50:26,067
You're all right. Okay.

682
00:50:26,359 --> 00:50:29,737
You all right, now?
Okay, come on. Come on.

683
00:50:33,032 --> 00:50:34,575
What's wrong with him?

684
00:50:34,659 --> 00:50:36,369
I don't know.

685
00:50:36,452 --> 00:50:38,080
Hachi, you want to come?
Because I gotta go.

686
00:50:38,163 --> 00:50:42,126
It's a work day. Come on, buddy.
Come on.

687
00:50:42,209 --> 00:50:43,544
I gotta go.

688
00:50:44,837 --> 00:50:45,796
Love you, honey.

689
00:50:45,879 --> 00:50:47,715
Love you, too.
See you tonight.

690
00:50:49,591 --> 00:50:51,010
Last chance.

691
00:50:53,387 --> 00:50:54,722
Bye.

692
00:51:22,459 --> 00:51:23,460
Hey, Mary Anne.

693
00:51:23,543 --> 00:51:24,753
Hey, Jas, how are you?

694
00:51:24,836 --> 00:51:26,296
I'm good.
Here's your coffee and donut.

695
00:51:26,379 --> 00:51:27,422
Oh, thank you, Jasjeet.

696
00:51:27,505 --> 00:51:28,673
Thank you.
You're welcome.

697
00:51:42,688 --> 00:51:44,106
Where's Hachi?

698
00:51:51,946 --> 00:51:54,032
Hey, Hachi!

699
00:51:55,033 --> 00:51:56,201
There he comes.

700
00:51:57,702 --> 00:52:02,291
Am I happy to see you. What?
Did you bring me your ball?

701
00:52:02,375 --> 00:52:04,210
What is he doing with a ball?

702
00:52:04,293 --> 00:52:08,923
You want to play catch? Here. Here.
Come here, come here. Here you go.

703
00:52:09,715 --> 00:52:10,883
Go get it.

704
00:52:11,717 --> 00:52:14,053
Okay, go get it.
Go get it.

705
00:52:15,054 --> 00:52:17,223
All right, good.
Now bring it back.

706
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:21,018
Oh, that's it.
That's what I wanted.

707
00:52:21,644 --> 00:52:24,438
Let's try another one.
Big one. Big long one.

708
00:52:25,314 --> 00:52:27,817
Okay, go get it. Go on.

709
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,152
Good boy!

710
00:52:30,654 --> 00:52:32,572
Yeah! Now bring it back.

711
00:52:32,656 --> 00:52:34,825
Okay, come on. Come on, boy,
come on, come on!

712
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:38,370
What a good boy!
What a good boy!

713
00:52:38,453 --> 00:52:41,415
Aren't you the good boy!
Did you see that?

714
00:52:42,082 --> 00:52:44,042
I threw the ball,
he brought it back.

715
00:52:44,126 --> 00:52:46,837
First time, a fetch.
A real fetch. Yeah.

716
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:49,089
Congratulations.
Thank you.

717
00:52:49,172 --> 00:52:51,550
You are a good boy!

718
00:52:51,633 --> 00:52:55,262
Okay, gotta go to work.
Come on, take your ball.

719
00:52:55,345 --> 00:52:58,181
There you go. First time.

720
00:52:58,932 --> 00:53:00,351
First time!

721
00:53:01,185 --> 00:53:03,312
No, no. Wait, wait, wait,
Mr. Professor! Wait, wait.

722
00:53:03,396 --> 00:53:05,064
I'll bring you your coffee right now.
All right.

723
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:06,440
I'm sorry.
I'm late today.

724
00:53:06,524 --> 00:53:08,192
Did you see what he did?

725
00:53:08,276 --> 00:53:10,403
I threw the ball, he brought it back.
It was a fetch.

726
00:53:10,486 --> 00:53:12,363
No, no, you keep the ball.

727
00:53:14,532 --> 00:53:15,783
You want me to have that?

728
00:53:15,867 --> 00:53:17,410
I can't play now,
I gotta go to work.

729
00:53:17,493 --> 00:53:18,953
I gotta go to work.

730
00:53:19,537 --> 00:53:21,372
I'll keep the ball, all right?

731
00:53:21,455 --> 00:53:22,790
Okay.
Here you go.

732
00:53:22,874 --> 00:53:24,292
Okay, thank you.
You're welcome.

733
00:53:24,375 --> 00:53:26,002
- And I'll see you at 5:00.
- I'll be here.

734
00:53:26,085 --> 00:53:28,839
Okay. Go home,
Hachi. Go home.

735
00:53:37,848 --> 00:53:42,269
All right, come here. Come here, come here.
Come here. Come on. Okay.

736
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:46,482
It's all right.
I'll see you at 5:00, all right?

737
00:53:46,565 --> 00:53:49,151
Good boy.
Stay, go home. Go on.

738
00:53:50,068 --> 00:53:51,236
Go on.

739
00:54:47,252 --> 00:54:49,337
Was it any better that time?

740
00:54:53,217 --> 00:54:54,468
All right.

741
00:54:54,802 --> 00:54:59,056
You remember we were talking about
John Philip Sousa,

742
00:54:59,139 --> 00:55:02,476
great march composer
around the turn of the century?

743
00:55:03,143 --> 00:55:06,230
He was a very famous man,

744
00:55:06,313 --> 00:55:09,400
but he had a huge thing
about recorded music.

745
00:55:09,483 --> 00:55:12,236
He would never allow his music
to be recorded.

746
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:14,446
Even when Thomas Edison
came to him

747
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:17,116
with his brand-new
invention, the phonograph.

748
00:55:18,075 --> 00:55:20,369
But Edison didn't care.
He went ahead and did it anyhow.

749
00:55:20,452 --> 00:55:24,541
Secretly he recorded
his marching band in a parade.

750
00:55:25,583 --> 00:55:28,420
Which I guess makes it
the very first bootleg.

751
00:55:32,299 --> 00:55:33,633
So what do you
think about that?

752
00:55:33,717 --> 00:55:36,011
Do you think
Sousa was right?

753
00:55:36,094 --> 00:55:38,096
Do you think it's okay now?
What about today's performers?

754
00:55:38,179 --> 00:55:40,140
Should you be able to just walk
up in the middle of a stage,

755
00:55:40,223 --> 00:55:44,936
plug in your CD player to a
Marshall stack and that's it?

756
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:46,104
It's good enough?

757
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,982
I don't know.

758
00:55:50,526 --> 00:55:54,030
I'm a lot older than you,
but I tend to think that

759
00:55:55,114 --> 00:55:59,285
there's an element of music
that cannot be captured.

760
00:55:59,368 --> 00:56:02,246
Life cannot be captured.
The human heart cannot be captured.

761
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:05,207
The moment of creation
itself is fleeting.

762
00:56:54,759 --> 00:56:56,594
Hey, Hachi, how you doing?

763
00:56:57,679 --> 00:56:58,888
Hey, Hachi.

764
00:57:46,145 --> 00:57:47,563
Good night, Hachi.

765
00:58:03,495 --> 00:58:04,872
Hey, buddy.

766
00:58:06,331 --> 00:58:07,958
You ready to go home?

767
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:11,378
Yeah?

768
00:58:26,978 --> 00:58:29,981
It's all right.
It's all right.

769
00:58:46,415 --> 00:58:47,917
Hey, Hachi.

770
00:58:49,627 --> 00:58:50,961
Hey, boy.

771
00:59:02,348 --> 00:59:03,933
Is this how he did it?

772
00:59:04,975 --> 00:59:06,727
I'm sorry. I'll learn.

773
00:59:16,488 --> 00:59:17,822
Andy?

774
00:59:19,241 --> 00:59:21,076
It's time to go, sweetheart.

775
00:59:21,993 --> 00:59:24,955
You're a good boy. You stay here, okay?
I'll be back.

776
01:00:07,291 --> 01:00:11,044
"I hear and behold
God in every object

777
01:00:11,128 --> 01:00:14,047
"Yet understand
God not in the least

778
01:00:14,131 --> 01:00:18,260
"Nor do I understand who there
can be more wonderful than myself

779
01:00:18,343 --> 01:00:21,888
"In the faces of men
and women I see God

780
01:00:21,972 --> 01:00:24,391
"And in my own face
in the glass

781
01:00:24,474 --> 01:00:27,227
"I find letters from God
dropt in the street

782
01:00:27,311 --> 01:00:30,397
"And every one
is sign'd by God's name

783
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,481
"And I leave them
where they are

784
01:00:32,565 --> 01:00:35,485
"For I know that
wherever I go

785
01:00:35,569 --> 01:00:40,866
"Others will punctually
come forever and ever"

786
01:01:36,966 --> 01:01:40,302
Look, you don't have
to wait anymore.

787
01:01:43,097 --> 01:01:44,932
He's not coming back.

788
01:01:56,026 --> 01:01:57,611
All right, Hachi.

789
01:01:59,571 --> 01:02:01,408
You do what you have to do.

790
01:02:46,912 --> 01:02:49,373
Come on, buddy,
come on. Let's go.

791
01:02:49,457 --> 01:02:51,333
Come on, boy. Come on.

792
01:02:54,574 --> 01:02:55,781
Come on, Hachi.

793
01:02:56,459 --> 01:02:57,627
Come on, Hachi.

794
01:02:57,758 --> 01:03:01,136
You're gonna be with us now.
Let's go. Come on.

795
01:03:01,219 --> 01:03:02,929
All right, we gotta go.
Ronnie's waiting.

796
01:03:03,013 --> 01:03:04,264
Come on.

797
01:03:06,892 --> 01:03:08,977
Let me get that
for you, sweetie.

798
01:03:13,815 --> 01:03:16,359
Come on, Hach. Up, up, up.
There we go.

799
01:03:16,443 --> 01:03:18,612
That's a good boy. Good.

800
01:03:18,945 --> 01:03:20,489
Good boy, Hachi.

801
01:03:24,242 --> 01:03:26,162
Watch your head,
watch your head.

802
01:03:26,245 --> 01:03:27,913
Good boy.

803
01:04:21,926 --> 01:04:23,345
Hey, there's my guy.
Andy?

804
01:04:23,428 --> 01:04:24,471
Yeah?

805
01:04:24,555 --> 01:04:27,224
Hachi! Hachi! Andy!

806
01:04:29,059 --> 01:04:30,060
Hachi!

807
01:04:31,061 --> 01:04:33,897
Hachi, get back here!
Hachi!

808
01:04:35,774 --> 01:04:37,442
Hachi, come on!

809
01:04:40,279 --> 01:04:41,363
Hachi!

810
01:04:43,782 --> 01:04:45,075
Hachi!

811
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,664
Hachi!

812
01:07:02,425 --> 01:07:05,302
Hey, looks like you
got your first visitor.

813
01:07:05,386 --> 01:07:06,887
Hey there, buddy.

814
01:07:07,263 --> 01:07:09,432
Come to welcome us
to our new home?

815
01:07:23,071 --> 01:07:24,239
Hey, Hach.

816
01:07:26,908 --> 01:07:28,744
Hey, Hachi!

817
01:07:28,827 --> 01:07:30,829
What are you doing here?

818
01:07:30,912 --> 01:07:32,539
Lookie, lookie.

819
01:07:37,419 --> 01:07:39,212
He's going right to his spot.

820
01:07:39,296 --> 01:07:40,338
I thought he moved away.

821
01:07:40,422 --> 01:07:42,050
He did.

822
01:07:42,133 --> 01:07:43,926
He looks hungry, yeah?

823
01:07:45,094 --> 01:07:47,388
You are a softie, Jas.

824
01:07:49,474 --> 01:07:51,684
Hey, Hachi.

825
01:07:51,768 --> 01:07:56,147
Want a hot dog, boy?
Go on, boy, have a hot dog.

826
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:57,857
Hey, Hachi.

827
01:07:58,816 --> 01:08:00,109
Maybe it's your cooking, Jas.

828
01:08:00,193 --> 01:08:01,235
The Jasjeet special.

829
01:08:01,319 --> 01:08:04,614
Come on, you'll like it.
Eat it. Eat it. It's good for you.

830
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,202
Come on.

831
01:08:09,577 --> 01:08:10,704
It's good.

832
01:08:11,455 --> 01:08:13,082
Where did he come from?

833
01:08:13,165 --> 01:08:15,042
Just showed up.

834
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:16,794
Come on, boy.
Take it.

835
01:08:17,628 --> 01:08:21,465
You better be careful, Hachi.
He's got hot dogs in there older than you.

836
01:08:22,299 --> 01:08:24,051
Don't listen to them, huh?

837
01:08:39,192 --> 01:08:41,194
- Hachi!
- Oh, God.

838
01:08:41,277 --> 01:08:44,447
Hi! Oh, God,
I was so worried about you.

839
01:08:48,493 --> 01:08:51,037
Why is she just
hanging around him?

840
01:08:51,162 --> 01:08:53,081
It's the professor's daughter.
Really?

841
01:08:53,164 --> 01:08:55,083
That's where he's been living.

842
01:08:59,504 --> 01:09:01,339
Will you come home with me?

843
01:09:02,382 --> 01:09:03,424
Hey, hey, hey...

844
01:09:03,508 --> 01:09:05,051
It's all right.
It's okay.

845
01:09:06,386 --> 01:09:07,721
Come on.
Come on.

846
01:09:07,805 --> 01:09:09,014
Let's go, buddy.

847
01:09:09,098 --> 01:09:10,975
Thank you very much.
Okay.

848
01:09:11,058 --> 01:09:12,518
Thank you!

849
01:09:18,023 --> 01:09:19,607
That's the best thing.

850
01:09:20,692 --> 01:09:22,444
Come on,
give me a coffee.

851
01:09:23,778 --> 01:09:25,822
Jasjeet, come on.
Give me a coffee.

852
01:09:39,879 --> 01:09:43,632
I think of him, too.
Every day.

853
01:10:11,912 --> 01:10:13,246
Hey.

854
01:10:14,664 --> 01:10:16,541
You know we love you, Hachi.

855
01:10:17,501 --> 01:10:19,753
We want you to stay here with us.

856
01:10:23,298 --> 01:10:27,969
But if you have to go,
that's okay, too.

857
01:10:29,846 --> 01:10:31,056
Okay.

858
01:10:50,284 --> 01:10:51,661
Goodbye, Hachi.

859
01:11:04,216 --> 01:11:06,134
Good afternoon, Hachi.

860
01:11:36,374 --> 01:11:38,126
Hey, Hachi.

861
01:11:39,002 --> 01:11:42,046
Here you go.
Don't tell Myra, all right?

862
01:11:44,632 --> 01:11:46,509
Good night, Hachi.

863
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:14,496
Hello, how are you?

864
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:15,955
I think...

865
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:34,892
Lucky! Let's go.

866
01:12:34,975 --> 01:12:36,894
Come on, sweetie.
Hey, Lucky.

867
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:40,898
Hey, girl. Come on,
Lucky, let's go.

868
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:50,157
Hey, excuse me, sir.
Mmm-hmm.

869
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,742
The dog out there.

870
01:12:51,825 --> 01:12:52,868
Yeah?

871
01:12:52,951 --> 01:12:56,081
Is that the dog that I've been
hearing so much about?

872
01:12:56,665 --> 01:12:57,749
Mmm-hmm.

873
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:00,502
What's it to you?

874
01:13:00,585 --> 01:13:05,048
I'm sorry. I'm Teddy Barnes.
I'm with the Woonsocket Call.

875
01:13:07,092 --> 01:13:09,344
Yeah, I've been hearing a lot
of talk about him on the trains.

876
01:13:09,427 --> 01:13:12,430
I don't know, sounds like it could
make a good story.

877
01:13:15,475 --> 01:13:18,186
It's Boilins,
Carl Boilins.

878
01:13:18,269 --> 01:13:22,690
B - O - I - L - I - N - S. Yes.
There's no "Y" in there.

879
01:13:22,774 --> 01:13:25,194
I'm the one that found him,
handed him over.

880
01:13:25,277 --> 01:13:26,737
Oh, yeah?

881
01:13:26,821 --> 01:13:31,283
So, Carl, where's he live?

882
01:13:31,367 --> 01:13:35,788
Well, we're not really sure.
He comes and goes.

883
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:37,706
Nobody bothers him?

884
01:13:37,790 --> 01:13:40,000
No, we put up with him.

885
01:13:40,084 --> 01:13:42,378
He just does
what he's doing.

886
01:13:42,461 --> 01:13:45,047
Hey, you mind
if I take a picture?

887
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:46,882
For the newspaper.

888
01:13:46,966 --> 01:13:48,718
I don't mind if Hachi don't mind.

889
01:13:48,801 --> 01:13:52,180
Thank you very much.
Very nice, very nice.

890
01:13:52,264 --> 01:13:54,391
One without first, please.

891
01:13:54,474 --> 01:13:56,893
Without the dog?
All right. Stay there.

892
01:13:58,019 --> 01:13:59,688
Well, I...

893
01:14:00,772 --> 01:14:02,065
Oh, yeah. All right.

894
01:14:02,149 --> 01:14:03,400
I appreciate it.

895
01:14:03,483 --> 01:14:04,818
That's very kind of you.

896
01:14:07,362 --> 01:14:08,572
Okay, nice and tight.
Oh, yeah.

897
01:14:08,655 --> 01:14:10,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

898
01:14:10,323 --> 01:14:11,324
Look at that there.

899
01:14:11,408 --> 01:14:12,701
Big smile.

900
01:14:13,577 --> 01:14:17,414
That's... That's beautiful.
Thank you.

901
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:33,181
Hey, Hachi.

902
01:14:34,932 --> 01:14:38,769
This kid in Derry
sent you his lunch money.

903
01:14:39,562 --> 01:14:41,856
He wants me to buy
you treats with it.

904
01:14:42,899 --> 01:14:44,901
It's like the
third one this week.

905
01:14:44,984 --> 01:14:48,821
If this keeps up,
I'll have to open a bank account for you.

906
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:51,867
Don't say I never
gave you nothing.

907
01:14:54,536 --> 01:14:56,955
The clog's making out
like a bandit here.

908
01:14:57,331 --> 01:14:59,416
Look at this,
isn't that cute?

909
01:15:01,418 --> 01:15:02,586
Hey, Hach.

910
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:04,171
What are you doing
with the money?

911
01:15:04,254 --> 01:15:05,297
I'm his executor.

912
01:15:15,723 --> 01:15:17,559
Be right with you, sir.

913
01:15:18,894 --> 01:15:23,273
River Junction local is now boarding
on track two, it's making all stops.

914
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,576
Hachi.

915
01:15:39,456 --> 01:15:41,375
Here you go, Hachi.

916
01:15:42,084 --> 01:15:43,502
There you are.

917
01:15:44,211 --> 01:15:45,337
Hungry, huh?

918
01:15:45,964 --> 01:15:49,050
Yes, he's very cold.
He must eat.

919
01:15:51,177 --> 01:15:53,847
I'm Jasjeet.
I run the hot dog stand.

920
01:15:54,055 --> 01:15:56,641
I'm Ken Fujiyoshi,
Professor Wilson's friend.

921
01:15:56,724 --> 01:15:58,476
Mr. Professor?

922
01:15:59,686 --> 01:16:01,229
One sugar, two cream.

923
01:16:02,897 --> 01:16:04,732
So then you must have read
the article, then?

924
01:16:04,816 --> 01:16:05,858
I did.

925
01:16:05,942 --> 01:16:07,277
You saw my name
in the article?

926
01:16:08,570 --> 01:16:10,029
Yes, I did.

927
01:16:10,113 --> 01:16:11,281
Twice.

928
01:16:11,364 --> 01:16:13,366
Please, let me help
with the expense.

929
01:16:13,449 --> 01:16:15,411
No, no, no, please.
No money.

930
01:16:15,494 --> 01:16:17,580
What if he gets sick?
Medical expenses?

931
01:16:17,663 --> 01:16:19,540
We'll take a collection.

932
01:16:19,623 --> 01:16:24,211
From the travelers, the vendors,
and we will take care of it for him.

933
01:16:24,295 --> 01:16:26,297
The station square
is Hachi's home now.

934
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:29,717
Every day he comes, same time,
same place, here only.

935
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,051
You'll do that for him?

936
01:16:31,135 --> 01:16:34,430
Take care of him?
Of course.

937
01:16:36,682 --> 01:16:38,183
All right, then I...

938
01:16:39,018 --> 01:16:41,770
I've got to sell some hot dogs.
Good to meet you.

939
01:16:41,854 --> 01:16:44,399
You, too.
Thank you very much.

940
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:49,863
It's been a year, hasn't it?

941
01:16:52,824 --> 01:16:55,327
I wake up sometimes
in the middle of the night

942
01:16:55,577 --> 01:16:58,330
and think about Parker.
He was a good friend.

943
01:16:59,205 --> 01:17:02,083
I understand how you feel.

944
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:06,338
Hachi, my friend,
Parker is never coming home.

945
01:17:06,838 --> 01:17:10,008
But if Hachiko wants to wait,
then Hachiko should wait.

946
01:17:10,175 --> 01:17:13,554
You want to wait for him, don't you?

947
01:17:16,515 --> 01:17:20,561
Have a long life Hachi.

948
01:17:31,572 --> 01:17:37,036
Come on, mister. There we are.
That's a good boy.

949
01:17:41,208 --> 01:17:44,378
Want some more?
Okay, come on.

950
01:17:47,339 --> 01:17:51,969
Okay, come on, boy.
Last piece. It's good, huh?

951
01:18:05,107 --> 01:18:06,941
See you tomorrow, Hachi.

952
01:18:08,694 --> 01:18:09,903
Ciao, Hachi.

953
01:18:46,190 --> 01:18:48,276
Final call for Oakland,

954
01:18:48,359 --> 01:18:51,529
Wood River Junction
and Four Corners

955
01:18:51,612 --> 01:18:53,322
leaving from track two.

956
01:19:11,341 --> 01:19:13,719
Ms. Wilson?
Nice to see you again.

957
01:19:13,802 --> 01:19:15,596
Good afternoon.
Thank you.

958
01:19:17,055 --> 01:19:19,141
That's the professor's wife, huh?

959
01:20:19,703 --> 01:20:20,871
Cate.

960
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,126
Ken.

961
01:20:29,213 --> 01:20:30,799
It's been a while.

962
01:20:31,716 --> 01:20:33,468
It certainly has.

963
01:20:43,895 --> 01:20:47,649
It's 10 years.
Can you believe it?

964
01:21:03,206 --> 01:21:04,583
Hi, Hachi.

965
01:21:11,172 --> 01:21:12,674
Hi, Hachi.

966
01:21:31,527 --> 01:21:33,279
All right, have a good one.

967
01:21:33,362 --> 01:21:34,447
Thank you, Jas.

968
01:21:42,121 --> 01:21:43,623
- Who would've thought?
- I know.

969
01:21:43,706 --> 01:21:46,167
I mean, when we first
went in there, I was like...

970
01:21:57,804 --> 01:21:59,014
Hachi?

971
01:22:06,063 --> 01:22:07,648
Hachi?

972
01:22:11,652 --> 01:22:14,571
You old thing,
you're still waiting.

973
01:22:30,004 --> 01:22:31,547
That's right.

974
01:22:47,814 --> 01:22:51,317
If it's all right, could I wait
with you for the next train?

975
01:22:54,363 --> 01:22:55,698
Yeah?

976
01:22:57,533 --> 01:22:58,951
Thanks.

977
01:23:08,293 --> 01:23:10,087
Oh, Hachi.

978
01:23:22,892 --> 01:23:24,644
- That's so cute.
- You like that one?

979
01:23:24,769 --> 01:23:26,146
Yeah.
Yeah.

980
01:23:26,229 --> 01:23:27,731
That's good, isn't it?

981
01:23:27,814 --> 01:23:28,857
That's me.

982
01:23:28,940 --> 01:23:30,942
I know, I remember.

983
01:23:31,484 --> 01:23:35,071
I remember. I was there that day.
I took that picture.

984
01:23:35,989 --> 01:23:37,741
He still looks so cute.

985
01:23:40,285 --> 01:23:41,369
He went to the wedding.

986
01:23:41,453 --> 01:23:44,372
Yeah. He's right there.

987
01:23:45,373 --> 01:23:46,583
Right there.

988
01:23:46,666 --> 01:23:49,085
Where did Grandpa find Hachi?

989
01:23:50,296 --> 01:23:53,841
Ronnie, actually,
Hachi found your grandfather.

990
01:23:53,924 --> 01:23:55,009
How?

991
01:23:56,677 --> 01:24:01,097
One night your grandfather was
coming back from a trip.

992
01:24:02,265 --> 01:24:04,225
He got off at the train station,

993
01:24:05,518 --> 01:24:07,604
he went inside
of the train station...

994
01:26:03,182 --> 01:26:04,558
Hey, boy.

995
01:26:06,268 --> 01:26:10,230
Hey! Come on, let's go.
Come on!

996
01:26:38,259 --> 01:26:39,928
Hachi!

997
01:26:40,345 --> 01:26:42,097
Hey, boy.

998
01:27:24,807 --> 01:27:26,809
I never met my grandfather.

999
01:27:27,643 --> 01:27:29,895
He died when
I was just a baby.

1000
01:27:29,979 --> 01:27:35,651
But when I hear about him and Hachi,
I feel like I know him.

1001
01:27:36,318 --> 01:27:39,322
They taught me
the meaning of loyalty,

1002
01:27:39,406 --> 01:27:42,993
that you should never forget
anyone that you've loved.

1003
01:27:43,785 --> 01:27:47,205
And that's why Hachi
will forever be my hero.

1004
01:27:58,300 --> 01:28:00,010
Oh, my God, look how cute he is!
Hi, boy.

1005
01:28:00,093 --> 01:28:01,720
He drives me crazy.

1006
01:28:01,803 --> 01:28:03,054
Oh, he's happy
to see somebody.

1007
01:28:03,138 --> 01:28:04,180
I know.

1008
01:28:06,350 --> 01:28:07,893
Can you walk?

1009
01:28:11,564 --> 01:28:13,357
Come on, Hachi.
Let's go.

1010
01:28:16,902 --> 01:28:18,362
Come on.

1011
01:28:20,448 --> 01:28:22,116
Hey, here boy.
