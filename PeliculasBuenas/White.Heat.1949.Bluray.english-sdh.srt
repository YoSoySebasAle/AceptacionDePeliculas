340
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:51,163
- I'll live. Hey, you're looking good.
- Yeah? Heh.

341
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:54,458
It's that prison diet. Great chef
in San Quentin. I hated to leave.

342
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:55,751
You did a whale of a job.

343
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,587
Ah, most talkative little con
I ever shared a cell with.

344
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,507
That whole syndicate comes up for trial
in a few weeks.

345
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,509
Now, what's that?

346
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,887
You put it on a pole,
wind a spool of silk thread around it...

347
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,931
...and you hold the pole over the water.

348
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,683
Then you sit under a nice shady tree
and relax.

349
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:15,103
After a while, a hungry fish comes along,
takes a nip at your hook...

350
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:16,313
...and you've got dinner.

351
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,358
For the next two weeks,
I'm not gonna think about anything...

352
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:21,944
...except the eternal struggle
between man and fish.

353
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:25,447
I've been promised a vacation.
You remember?

354
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,491
Sorry, Hank, that's out.

355
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:32,871
Phil, look at me.
College degree, lovable personality...

356
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,998
...and I spend most of my time in prison.

357
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,793
An undercover specialist.
Eight sentences in five years.

358
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,003
Dannemora, Sing Sing, Leavenworth.

359
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,714
I joined the department
to put criminals behind bars...

360
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,342
...and here I am, stir-crazy.

361
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,638
Read this.

362
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,984
Who checks confessions in Springfield?

363
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,696
Every rookie knows Scratch Morton
went underground after that hotel job.

364
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,740
You're not gonna let Jarrett get away
with a two-bit prison stretch?

365
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,909
- Maybe.
FALLON: Maybe?

366
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:15,080
A hoodlum turns himself in on a phony rap
and beats the gas chamber, heh.

367
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,375
I'll bet he's thumbing his nose
at Uncle Sam right now and loving it.

368
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:19,668
Jarrett outsmarted you.

369
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:23,881
That's just what we want him to think.
We're working with the Springfield police.

370
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,217
We arranged for the confession to check.
So, what happens?

371
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,636
Jarrett does a stretch in the penitentiary.

372
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:32,848
In case he get lonely
and wants to talk to someone...

373
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:37,060
...we're gonna let one of our boys
do a stretch right in the same cell.

374
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,937
Still going fishing, Hank?

375
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,689
Yeah.

376
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:44,318
- In what prison?
- You'll enjoy the food. Wonderful chef.

377
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:47,279
- Arrested him myself.
- Okay, okay, what's the pitch?

378
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:50,032
You'll be committed to the penitentiary
in Illinois.

379
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,702
You'll be one of Jarrett's cellmates.
Stick with him until you find out...

380
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:58,582
...where he unloaded $300,000 in federal
currency without a single bill showing up.

381
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,752
Also, try to learn the identity
of the very special fence...

382
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,254
...that engineered this deal.

383
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,132
FALLON:
How does he operate?

384
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,010
Buys stolen money here,
30, 40 cents on the dollar.

385
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:14,264
Peddles it on the European black market
for, pfft, who knows how much.

386
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:17,517
No questions asked. Sweet racket.

387
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,646
- In step with the times.
EVANS: Well, that's your assignment.

388
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:25,692
I wouldn't ask you to do another
undercover job if we weren't up against it.

389
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:26,985
- Hello, Hank.
FALLON: Hi.

390
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,404
Prison records from Illinois.
Your new buddies.

391
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,948
FALLON:
Busy little place, isn't it?

392
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,325
Twenty-seven hundred
of the roughest and toughest.

393
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:36,578
And a few who might recognize you.
Let's go to work.

394
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,126
- Find another old client?
- Yeah. Red Draper.

395
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,504
Questioned him in '46
about a warehouse job.

396
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,339
Well, that makes two for transfer.

397
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,926
- Better run through the arrest once more.
- Oh, yeah. let's see.

398
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,553
I'll be picked up in a joint
known as Tom's Hideaway.

399
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,347
- Bill's Hideaway.
- Bill's Hideaway.

400
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,265
On what seems like
an ordinary hood roundup.

401
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,893
One of the boys spots me as a lamister.
I make a break for it.

402
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,521
When I pick myself off the floor,
I'm meek as a baby.

403
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,148
- How do I get information out to you?
- Visiting days.

404
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:06,608
Oh, mother again?

405
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,361
- Wife this time.
- Wife? Ooh, fine.

406
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,531
One thing, though. This time,
get me somebody with a good memory.

407
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,158
I had a lot of trouble with my mother
in San Quentin.

408
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:18,829
This time we'll get you a girl in the bureau
who's a memory expert.

409
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,832
- I'm partial to blonds.
- Well, who isn't?

410
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,959
As soon as I pick her,
I'll send you a picture.

411
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,210
Uh-uh.

412
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,753
- We move this guy.
- Who is he?

413
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:29,047
Bo Creel. Arrested him two years ago.

414
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,429
EVANS:
Bo Creel. Wait a minute.

415
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,681
- We don't have to worry about him.
- Huh?

416
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,851
Finishes his stretch Saturday.
He'll be out before you're sentenced.

417
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:44,146
Good. Bo Creel would know me
in the dark.

418
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:47,691
This job isn't gonna be
like any of the others, Hank.

419
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,902
You see, uh,
there's insanity in the Jarretts.

420
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:54,698
Some of it rubbed off on Cody.
His father died in an institution.

421
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:59,703
I've had a few strange cellmates in my time,
but this sounds like the jackpot.

422
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:02,372
When he was a kid,
he used to fake headaches...

423
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:06,418
...to get his mother's attention away
from the rest of the family. It worked.

424
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,962
As he grew up,
the fancied headaches became real...

425
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,757
...until now they tear him to pieces.

426
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:14,342
Any minute,
he's apt to crack open at the seams...

427
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,721
...and there goes our case.
So you'll be working against time.

428
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,474
Suits me. Quicker the better.

429
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:24,019
Except that Cody's not an easy guy
to get close to in a hurry.

430
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,230
The only person he's ever cared about
or trusted is his mother.

431
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,442
No one else has ever made a dent,
not even his wife.

432
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,944
His mother's been the prop
that's held him up.

433
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:36,615
He's got a fierce
psychopathic devotion for her.

434
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:39,993
All his life, whenever he got in a spot,
he'd just put out his hand...

435
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:42,079
...and there was Ma Jarrett.

436
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:46,166
Without her, maybe Cody'd...
Just like his old man.

437
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,252
You mean I'm supposed to take
Mama's place?

438
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:52,047
Never can tell. He might need someone.

439
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:55,425
I'll practice up on my lullabies.
Nothing else here.

440
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:57,928
Good. Let's run through
your background again.

441
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:00,514
Born Detroit, March 23rd, 1919.

442
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:04,267
State reform school, 1934, vandalism.

443
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,771
Arrested: suspicion, grand larceny,
Portland, 1939.

444
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,022
EVANS:
Good.

MAN:
The State of Illinois v. Arthur Cody Jarrett.

446
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:15,070
Arthur Cody Jarrett,
on your own admission...

447
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,781
...you have been convicted of the robbery
of the Palace Hotel...

448
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,825
...on the night of October 12th.

449
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:22,869
And it is now my duty
to pronounce sentence.

450
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:26,581
For the crime of grand larceny,
you are hereby sentenced to serve...

451
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:29,417
...not less than one
and not more than three years...

452
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,962
...in the state penitentiary.

MAN:
The State of Illinois v. Victor Pardo.

454
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,636
How is he, tough?

[CHATTERING]

456
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:58,780
With Big Ed giving the orders now,
there'll be all kinds of fireworks.

457
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:02,492
He's got plans that'll make
the old Jarrett mob look like a...

458
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,497
Can you read him?

459
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:08,999
Yeah.

460
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:15,547
Parker moves his lips pretty good.
It's about Big Ed.

461
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,716
CODY:
What'd he say?

462
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,635
He's the number one boy now,
Parker says.

463
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,180
In more ways than one.

464

[ALL LAUGH]

465
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:29,227
- What was that crack?
- I couldn't read him, Cody.

466
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:32,522
- Was that about my wife?
- Honest, Cody. He had his mouth covered.

467
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,233
Maybe a kick in his skull
would do him some good.

468
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:39,196
They got rules in this chicken coop.
You start anything, you wind up in the hole.

469
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:40,947
Did I ask you for any advice?

470
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,199
Look, Pardo...

471
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:43,825
...I've been watching you.

472
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:46,620
Up till now you haven't done anything
I can put my finger on.

473
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:50,790
Maybe that's what bothers me. I don't know
you, and what I don't know, I don't trust.

474
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,376
You're just a face and a number.
Let's keep it that way.

475
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:57,172
- When I want your help, I'll ask for it.
- Have it your way, Cody.

00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,507
MAN [OVER PA]:
Attention, men. Attention.

477
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:02,552

Keep it moving, boys. No talking.

00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:17,817
Well, if it ain't Bo Creel.

483
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,987
Boys in L.A. had a coming-out party
planned for you a month ago.

00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:24,032
Yeah, I was packing and, bang,
flat on my back with pneumonia.

485
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,244
- The doc's checking me out today.
- Well, see you in eight years.

00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,761
I'm leaving tomorrow, Cody.
Anything I can do for you on the coast?

00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:48,181
Yeah. Look up Big Ed.
Tell him I was asking for him.

Scared, sonny?

00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,620
Break it up over there.

A nice gold medal for the copper.

Only maybe he's gonna get it
sooner than he thinks.

1340
01:44:49,199 --> 01:44:52,118
- Let him have it.
- Oh, no, and lose our ace in the hole?

He's gonna walk us out of here.
Ain't you, copper? Get up.

- They won't shoot one of their own.

- They won't make any deals.
- You better pray that they do.

might as well give up.

If I can, mister, will you go easy on me?

1349
01:45:26,403 --> 01:45:29,864
I'll tell him you'll let him get away
because you don't want your guy hurt.

1350
01:45:30,073 --> 01:45:33,826
He'll believe me. Then when he comes out,
you can do what you want with him.
