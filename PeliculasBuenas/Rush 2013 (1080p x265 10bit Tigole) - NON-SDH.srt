2
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:50,289
<i>...what has
turned into a classic Formula 1 season.</i>

3
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:53,818
<i>With the
weather conditions so uncertain,</i>

4
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,209
<i>the drivers prepare for...</i>

5
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,809
<i>...the track
is still dangerously wet,</i>

6
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,289
<i>but following a drivers' meeting,</i>

7
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,373
<i>- a decision has finally been taken.</i>
<i>- Three minutes to go.</i>

8
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,209
<i>Everybody off the grid now.</i>

9
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:25,289
<i>Twenty-five drivers
start every season in Formula 1,</i>

10
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,373
<i>and each year two of us die.</i>

11
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,497
<i>What kind of person
does a job like this?</i>

12
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,729
<i>Not normal men, for sure.</i>

13
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,974
<i>Rebels, lunatics, dreamers.</i>

14
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:42,051
<i>People who are desperate to make a mark</i>

15
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,411
<i>and are prepared to die trying.</i>

16
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,855
<i>My name is Niki Lauda,</i>

17
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,409
<i>and racing people
know me for two things.</i>

18
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:55,176
<i>The first is my rivalry with him.</i>

19
00:01:57,537 --> 00:01:59,077
<i>You want to change?</i>

20
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:02,254
<i>Photographers,
please clear the grid.</i>

21
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,738
What about Hunt? Has he changed?

22
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,529
No, he's going on wets.

23
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,729
<i>I don't know
why it became such a big thing.</i>

24
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:13,098
<i>We were just drivers
busting each other's balls.</i>

25
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,609
<i>To me this is perfectly normal,</i>

26
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,849
<i>but other people saw it differently,</i>

27
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,774
<i>that whatever it was between us
went deeper.</i>

28
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,213
Then we go on wets too.

29
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,129
<i>The other thing I'm remembered for</i>

30
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:43,969
<i>is what happened on 1st August, 1976,</i>

31
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,569
<i>when I was chasing him</i>

32
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,729
<i>like an asshole.</i>

33
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,689
Trauma trolley, please.

34
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,169
Hello, I think the racetrack
telephoned ahead that I was coming.

35
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,615
Hunt. James Hunt.

36
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,773
What's the matter? No one ever seen
a spot of blood before?

37
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,781
- Are you all right?
- Absolutely fine.

38
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,819
We all thought
you'd been in an accident.

39
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:40,977
I have.

40
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,293
If you call a friendly disagreement
with another driver an accident.

41
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:52,289
What did you disagree about?

42
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,860
It's none of your business.

43
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,972
Sorry.

44
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,335
His wife.

45
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,969
That's going to need a couple
of stitches. It's a nasty cut.

46
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,053
It was a nasty blow.
Done with a bloody crowbar.

47
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,735
- Why? What did you do?
- Nothing.

48
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:12,571
Only what she asked me to do.

49
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,335
Which was...

50
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,496
I'd be happy to show you, if you like.

51
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,977
Oh! Sorry.

52
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,890
<i>I have a theory
why women like racing drivers.</i>

53
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,649
<i>It's not because
they respect what we do,</i>

54
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,529
<i>driving round and round in circles.</i>

55
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,101
<i>Mostly they think that's pathetic,
and they're probably right.</i>

56
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,412
<i>It's our closeness to death.</i>

57
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,009
<i>You see, the closer you are to death,
the more alive you feel.</i>

58
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,089
<i>The more alive you are.
And they can see that in you.</i>

59
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,013
<i>They feel that in you.</i>

60
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,411
<i>My name is James Hunt.</i>

61
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,569
<i>My father is a stockbroker,</i>

62
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,177
<i>my sister is a barrister
and my brother is an accountant.</i>

63
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,695
<i>And I...</i>

64
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,860
<i>Well, I do this.</i>

65
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,895
<i>It's a wonderful way to live.</i>

66
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,098
<i>It's the only way to drive.</i>

67
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:12,451
<i>As if each day is your last.</i>

68
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,289
I've never been to a Grand Prix before.

69
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,209
Oh, you still haven't.

70
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,736
- This is Formula 3.
- What's that?

71
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,889
It's a lower division,

72
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,416
where idiots like me mess about

73
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,569
in the hope of being talent-spotted
to race in Formula 1.

74
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,572
- You look disappointed.
- No.

75
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:43,329
Ah. You only slept with me
because you thought I was famous.

76
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,900
That's not true.

77
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,649
Don't worry. I will be one day.

78
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,289
Morning, everyone.

79
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,894
- This is Nursie.
- Gemma.

80
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,489
Nursie, this is Bubbles Horsley,
team manager.

81
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,571
How do you do?

82
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,769
- Bubbles?
- Yeah.

83
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,849
- Doc Postlethwaite, our designer.
- How do you do?

84
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:04,775
And Alexander, Lord Hesketh,
the team's owner.

85
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,300
How do you do?

86
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,649
Fine, thanks.

87
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,609
Well done, Superstar.

88
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,136
- That's the car?
- Yep, that's her.

89
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,979
Lotus 59.

90
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,821
1,000cc Cosworth MAE engine.

91
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,774
She's no beauty,
but goes like the clappers.

92
00:06:27,865 --> 00:06:30,449
Nothing to be worried about.
Does it before every race.

93
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,609
Good sign, actually. Means he's stoked.

94
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,820
<i>All Formula 3 cars
to the assembly area now, please.</i>

95
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,739
<i>...drivers please bring them
to the scrutineering bay now.</i>

96
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,700
All right, Superstar?

97
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,529
Never better, patron.

98
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,010
- Have a gargle with this.
- Thank you.

99
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,901
Quick toke of this.

100
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:04,700
<i>At Crystal Palace today,
James Hunt's on pole,</i>

101
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,849
<i>with Austrian newcomer
Niki Lauda alongside him</i>

102
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,569
<i>and Dave Walker completing Row 1.</i>

103
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,050
<i>Row 2 is Mike Beuttler and Dave Morgan,</i>

104
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:17,060
<i>- with Tony Trimmer and Gerry Birrell.</i>
- Who's that?

105
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,935
He's new.

106
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:22,329
- Some German.
- Austrian.

107
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,489
He's been here since 5:00 am,
walking the track.

108
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,929
You might actually
have to concentrate today, James.

109
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,534
You'll need these.

110
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:32,849
Okay, start her up.

111
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:35,369
Ah! What music!

112
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,929
They could never have imagined it,

113
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,217
those pioneers
who invented the automobile,

114
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:43,540
that it would possess us like this,
in our imaginations, in our dreams.

115
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,577
Nursie, men love women,

116
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,529
but even more than that,

117
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,852
men love cars.

118
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:02,133
- Come on, James!
- James! Come on, James!

119
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,541
Go, James!

120
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,449
<i>Hunt's still in the lead,</i>

121
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,612
<i>but Niki Lauda is right on his tail.</i>

122
00:08:24,265 --> 00:08:27,289
<i>Hunt and Lauda are
proving to be in a class of their own.</i>

123
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,894
<i>They're leaving the pack far behind.</i>

124
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,894
<i>Herr</i> Red Devil's on his tail.

125
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:39,089
<i>Lauda takes
a look down the inside...</i>

126
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:42,414
<i>...and he's sold him a dummy!</i>

127
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,932
<i>Lauda is through! He's in the lead!</i>

128
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,171
<i>Hunt will be determined
to make up for that mistake.</i>

129
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,500
<i>Hunt's in Lauda's slipstream.</i>

130
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,578
<i>Lauda's not leaving any gap.</i>

131
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:10,695
<i>The Lotus goes for the inside.
It's an aggressive move from Hunt.</i>

132
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,769
<i>Oh! There's contact!</i>

133
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,693
<i>The leaders have spun out!
Lauda's facing the wrong way!</i>

134
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,657
<i>The back marker's gone through.</i>

135
00:09:29,864 --> 00:09:31,689
<i>You can see why Hunt's fellow drivers</i>

136
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,499
<i>call him "Hunt the Shunt".</i>

137
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,049
Asshole!

138
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,814
- Go on, James!
- The Kraut's out of it.

139
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,129
<i>Lauda is clearly furious.</i>

140
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,649
<i>There's every reason
to expect sharp words in the pits.</i>

141
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,539
<i>It's gonna be victory for Hunt.</i>

142
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:51,009
<i>It's gonna be an ignominious defeat
for Niki Lauda.</i>

143
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:59,649
<i>So James Hunt scores his
third major Formula 3 win of the season</i>

144
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:00,890
<i>here at Crystal Palace,</i>

145
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,809
<i>after a desperate battle
with Niki Lauda.</i>

146
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,539
<i>Lauda was unable to restart</i>

147
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,381
<i>after Hunt's aggressive move
caused them both to spin out</i>

148
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,651
<i>in the last lap of the race.</i>

149
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,770
Hard luck.
Better luck next time.

150
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:14,855
Hey, asshole.

151
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,169
That was my line. I had that corner.

152
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:21,413
Do you mean the one that you spun out of
and finished facing the other way?

153
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,929
I think that corner had you.

154
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,529
That move was total suicide.
What if I hadn't braked?

155
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,409
- We'd have crashed.
- But we didn't, did we?

156
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,378
Thanks to your impeccable
survival instincts.

157
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,373
Fuck you. What's your name?

158
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:41,424
James Simon Wallis Hunt.
Remember it, my little Jerry friend.

159
00:10:41,425 --> 00:10:43,409
<i>Jawohl.</i> Remember ze name.

160
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,249
And it's very simple. Hunt.
It rhymes with...

161
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,449
...cunt.

162
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,930
A word that happens
to describe you perfectly!

163
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,049
Who was that?

164
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,289
I've no idea.
He looks like a rat, doesn't he?

165
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,975
<i>In my home town, Vienna,</i>

166
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,732
<i>my family is famous
for one thing - business.</i>

167
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,577
<i>My grandfather was a businessman,</i>

168
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,495
<i>my father, too.</i>

169
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:10,489
<i>So when they heard I wanted
to race cars for a living,</i>

170
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,299
<i>they had a few things to say.</i>

171
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,140
<i>Never!</i>

172
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,427
<i>Racing is for playboys and dilettantes.</i>

173
00:11:17,637 --> 00:11:20,227
<i>Frivolous amateurs
with nothing in their heads.</i>

174
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:22,557
<i>The name Lauda...</i>

175
00:11:22,937 --> 00:11:25,567
<i>belongs with politicians and economists,</i>

176
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:27,567
<i>on the front pages.</i>

177
00:11:28,027 --> 00:11:30,067
<i>What if this is all I can do?</i>

178
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:33,157
<i>Then you need my money
more than ever,</i>

179
00:11:33,617 --> 00:11:36,447
<i>so do as I say and follow me
into the family business.</i>

180
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,775
<i>Gut.</i>

181
00:11:42,497 --> 00:11:44,377
<i>Keep your money.</i>

182
00:11:44,707 --> 00:11:46,667
<i>Don't invest in me.</i>

183
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:49,297
<i>But when I'm world champion</i>

184
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,337
<i>and my name is on the front pages too...</i>

185
00:11:52,677 --> 00:11:54,427
<i>you will regret it.</i>

186
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,341
<i>Get out and never show your face again!</i>

187
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,452
<i>So if my family
wasn't going to help me,</i>

188
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:05,369
<i>I decided to risk everything
and take out a loan myself.</i>

189
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:08,340
<i>I found a Formula 1 team
with an okay car</i>

190
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,498
<i>and an owner who had run out of money</i>

191
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,772
<i>and was willing to accept my terms.</i>

192
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,854
And so,
ladies and gentlemen,

193
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,809
I'm delighted to say

194
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:20,337
that the winner of the Guild of Motoring
Writers Award Driver of the Year...

195
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,531
is James Hunt.

196
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:27,895
Superb news!

197
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,812
- Well done, James.
- Superstar!

198
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,415
Fantastic!

199
00:12:33,905 --> 00:12:36,329
Well done. Congratulations.
Thank you so much.

200
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,489
Yes!

201
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,849
Erm...

202
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,660
You know, my parents
always wanted me to be a doctor...

203
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:43,969
...or a stockbroker or something.

204
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,729
They gave me the first-class education,

205
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,889
but, well, that all went terribly wrong

206
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,770
and I ended up with you lot.

207
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,329
Thank you. I need it more than you do.

208
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:00,056
I mean, I have a hot head,
an inability to tolerate discipline.

209
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,535
- Yes!
- Very true.

210
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,093
I fall out with people left and right.

211
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,849
The only creatures I've ever really
loved or have treated honourably

212
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,852
are budgerigars.

213
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:15,175
So in any normal area of life I'd be...
or I am, a total liability.

214
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,850
The only thing I've got going for me
is I'm quick in a car.

215
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,009
So, thank you for this
and for acknowledging that.

216
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,529
I'm going to give it to my father

217
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,369
and tell him to put it
on the mantelpiece

218
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,769
and imagine it's a first-class degree
in medicine.

219
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,929
Well done, Superstar.

220
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:45,536
Another season like that
and I'll move you up to the big time.

221
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,289
Come on, you don't think I'm ready now?

222
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,658
You are. I'm not.
I've got to find you a car first.

223
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:53,209
Well, go on, then. Chop-chop.

224
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,569
Don't wait too long. You don't want him
to do what Lauda just did.

225
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,609
- Why? What did he do?
- Got himself a drive with BRM.

226
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,889
Well, how the hell did he do that?
He's a nobody.

227
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,409
He's never won a bloody thing.

228
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,409
Apparently, took out a loan
and bought his way in

229
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:06,129
with two million Austrian schillings.

230
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,575
Jesus.

231
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:30,139
Niki Lauda.
Here for pre-season testing. BRM?

232
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:34,460
Sign the release form.
I'll let them know you're here.

233
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,769
- Mr Stanley.
- Good morning.

234
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,769
- Good morning.
- Good morning. Clay!

235
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:53,529
Let me introduce you
to our number-one driver,

236
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,532
Clay Regazzoni.

237
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,659
- How are you?
- Good.

238
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,414
- Pleasure.
- And these are your mechanics.

239
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:07,489
They're reporting exclusively to you,
as per contract.

240
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,329
Pleasure. Do you wanna see the car?

241
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,775
Sure.

242
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,221
Hello.

243
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,696
There she is. P160.

244
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,096
- Same as Regazzoni's?
- Identical in every detail.

245
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,540
How much does she weigh?

246
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:30,296
- 600 kilos.
- But that's crazy.

247
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,169
- Why so heavy?
- It's a V12 engine.

248
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,369
That lump weighs 190K on its own.

249
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,369
Okay.

250
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,729
What horsepower are you getting? 490?

251
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:43,209
- No, no, 450.
- Well, it's not enough.

252
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,689
It needs to be 500,

253
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,449
and the engine
needs to be 20 kilo lighter.

254
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,769
We already tried.

255
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:48,931
- Tried what?
- Everything.

256
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,689
We replaced the entire exhaust system.

257
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,978
- Barely made a difference.
- Are you using magnesium parts?

258
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,529
Now the engine block.

259
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:11,261
Any mounting or fixing plates,
strip it out also.

260
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,729
When you've done that,
we have to look at the aerodynamics,

261
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,494
front and rear wing.

262
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,012
Okay, thank you. Good night.

263
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,415
What was Regazzoni's time?

264
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,701
1:53.

265
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:03,969
Okay, now put him in my car,
and he'll go round two seconds faster.

266
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:07,019
- Well, that's impossible.
- No chance.

267
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:12,409
We've been
working on it all night.

268
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,529
Put Regazzoni in the car.
See what happens.

269
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,449
I don't understand.
Why am I supposed to do this?

270
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,449
I don't know, Clay.
He just wants you to take it for a spin.

271
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,249
Gloves, please.

272
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,695
<i>'fanculo.</i>

273
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:11,009
- I would say we push it a bit...
- All right.

274
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:13,089
What did you do to the car?

275
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,617
That's information I will share with you
under certain conditions only.

276
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,295
Go on.

277
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,054
A guaranteed place in the team,

278
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,930
and a paid contract on equal terms
with Regazzoni for two years.

279
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,774
Are you crazy?

280
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:30,417
Clay's a senior figure in Formula 1.
You're just a rookie.

281
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,330
Well, the only reason we took you on
is because you're paying us.

282
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,929
Well, as of now, if you want me to stay,
we rip up the contract.

283
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,661
- I don't pay you a cent.
- That's outrageous!

284
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,252
Was he quicker in my car?

285
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,972
He was, wasn't he?

286
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,931
Did he go two seconds faster?

287
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,015
2.3.

288
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,858
So, have a think,

289
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:00,731
work out your priorities
and get back to me.

290
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,141
Hey, Niki.

291
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:22,420
I know what you're going to say,
that it's none of my business.

292
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,531
What?

293
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,252
If it's the track manager
you're taking on your date tonight...

294
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:30,929
It's none of your business.

295
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:34,696
Okay, but if you want my advice,
I'd let this one go.

296
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,691
I'm not questioning your taste.
She is a great girl, but...

297
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:45,289
Agnes's last boyfriend
was a British Formula 2 driver

298
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,689
who has a reputation for two things.

299
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,375
For being a little crazy on the track,

300
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:54,694
and for going all night and all day
and all night again in bed.

301
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:58,329
He's a good driver,
but an immortal fuck, apparently.

302
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,369
I don't know about you, but
that's not an act I'd like to follow.

303
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,692
But if that doesn't bother you...

304
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,580
What's his name, the driver?

305
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,335
Hunt. James Hunt.

306
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,897
You see, you share information
and I share information.

307
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:24,457
That's what teammates are for.

308
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,249
<i>Where the hell are we going?</i>

309
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,609
<i>I promise
it'll be worth it.</i>

310
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,055
<i>Just keep them closed.</i>

311
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,935
Wait for it.

312
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,579
Wait for it.

313
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:50,376
There. What do you say?

314
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,060
She's Formula 1.

315
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:54,174
Yes, she is, Superstar.

316
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:57,489
Your brother and I got together
with the bean counters.

317
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,969
And since the economics of F1

318
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,609
are not so significantly different
to the economics of Formula 2,

319
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:05,011
well, we thought if we were
going to be losing money,

320
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,249
we might as well be doing it on
the big roulette table in Formula 1.

321
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,572
You fat, little, inbred beauty.
Come here.

322
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:19,212
Actually, credit where it's due,
we got the idea from Niki.

323
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,489
- Who?
- Lauda.

324
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,329
Bought his way in, rather than
mess about in the lower divisions.

325
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,900
I thought, "Bloody hell, he's right."

326
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:29,609
No sponsorship, Superstar.
I hope you approve.

327
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:33,615
No vulgar logos
for cigarettes or condoms.

328
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:36,218
Just plain white with the flags. Ooh!

329
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:39,620
And racing overalls which read,

330
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:43,409
"Sex. Breakfast of champions."

331
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,899
So, when do we start?

332
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,057
- Soon as you're ready.
- Ready?

333
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:53,941
I've been waiting for this
my whole life.

334
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,969
- Hi, welcome to Watkins Glen.
- Hello!

335
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,734
<i>When the season started,
people wondered</i>

336
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:09,860
<i>whether Lord Hesketh and his team
of upper-class enthusiasts</i>

337
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:14,689
<i>were bringing glamour
to the racing community, or just comedy.</i>

338
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,849
Certainly, it was the first time
anyone had seen

339
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:20,489
a butler serving oysters and caviar
in the pits.

340
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:23,329
But they have made quite an impact.

341
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:26,569
Sixth in France, fourth in Britain
and third in Holland.

342
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:30,249
<i>All drivers on the track,
caution flags are out.</i>

343
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,424
<i>A severe crash at the Esses.</i>

344
00:22:32,425 --> 00:22:34,529
<i>Red flag.
There is a car off the track.</i>

345
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,289
And reports are reaching me

346
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,497
that there has been
a serious accident in qualifying.

347
00:22:38,704 --> 00:22:41,449
Er, the identity of the driver we don't
currently have at the moment,

348
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,657
but, as you can tell
from all the activity

349
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,449
going on behind me towards the track,

350
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,929
it is clearly a grave incident indeed.

351
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,409
We will, of course,
have more information for you

352
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,457
as and when we get it,

353
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:54,575
but it is the sight and sound
of Formula 1 nobody likes to see.

354
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,334
- Get your hands off me.
- Hey, come on.

355
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:11,929
<i>Drivers of top stature</i>

356
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,729
<i>we've lost just in the past four seasons</i>

357
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:18,649
<i>have included Piers Courage,
Jochen Rindt,</i>

358
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:22,009
<i>Jo Siffert, Roger Williamson</i>

359
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,289
<i>and today, at Watkins Glen,</i>

360
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:26,611
<i>Formula 1 has claimed another driver.</i>

361
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,497
<i>The Tyrrell team
have withdrawn from the race.</i>

362
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,329
<i>Their places on the grid
will be left empty.</i>

363
00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:34,776
- Terrible.
- They should cancel the race.

364
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,535
Why?

365
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,296
He made a mistake,
went into the corner too fast.

366
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,889
It's his fault.

367
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,779
- Is that right?
- It's obvious.

368
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,899
Look at the tyre marks.

369
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,609
So says the nobody
who had to pay for his own drive.

370
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,290
How's that working out for you,
by the way?

371
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:53,300
Fine. How is it at the back?

372
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,292
Not planning on being there for long.

373
00:23:57,065 --> 00:23:58,769
<i>Ten minutes to the warm-up lap.</i>

374
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,289
<i>Ten minutes.</i>

375
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:01,621
<i>Asshole.</i>

376
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,975
Arsehole.

377
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:09,729
<i>Heading into
the Grand Hotel hairpin, second gear.</i>

378
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:10,809
Turn in hard,

379
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:13,461
looking for late apex,
gentle with the bar.

380
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:18,339
Heading into Portier, second gear,
clip the apex,

381
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:22,011
light brake, stay in second,
looking for a good exit.

382
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:24,489
Heading through the tunnel,
gradual right,

383
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:27,529
up through third, fourth, fifth...

384
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,532
Is Alexander round?

385
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,729
Er, yes, he was.

386
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:34,409
He went back to the house
to take a call.

387
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,249
He'll be back shortly.

388
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,412
He only wanted to show me
his pride and joy.

389
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:42,169
Rhymes with "boy", if you ask me.

390
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:44,049
And "toy".

391
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:48,329
God, it's so flimsy
for something that costs so much.

392
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:52,409
There's no comfort,
no protection, nothing.

393
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:55,129
No, it's just a little coffin, really.

394
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:58,249
Surrounded by high-octane fuel in here.

395
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:01,249
Being driven round 170 miles per hour.

396
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,413
To all intents and purposes,
this thing's a bomb on wheels.

397
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,493
You're James, aren't you?

398
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,220
Yes.

399
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,899
You fit the description.

400
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,701
Is that right?

401
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,898
Suzy. Friend of Alex's.

402
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:21,139
Yeah, yeah. I know exactly.

403
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,369
What was the description?

404
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,969
Mostly positive,
in terms of appearance.

405
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:28,177
Negative only in terms of character.

406
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,613
I've been told to avoid you.

407
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,421
By whom?

408
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:35,769
Alexander. He says you're a bad boy.

409
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:38,129
Alexander doesn't know
what he's talking about.

410
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:40,569
I was. I'm not any more.

411
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:44,169
The new me is very professional.
Early to bed, early to rise.

412
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,809
- All very dull.
- Hmm.

413
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,249
But according to the team,

414
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,931
"The best way to
keep beating the goose-stepper."

415
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:52,329
Is that what you were doing
when I came in?

416
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:55,369
Yes, visualisation techniques,
memorising the circuit,

417
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:58,055
in this case Monaco, which is up next.

418
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:06,089
Personally, I've always been a great
believer in getting there on the day,

419
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:08,649
putting my foot down
and playing chicken with everyone else.

420
00:26:10,705 --> 00:26:12,409
But they don't want me
doing that any more.

421
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:16,495
They want my body like a temple
and my mind like a monk.

422
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:20,369
And what about your soul, your heart?

423
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,609
Well, they've got ideas about that, too.

424
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:25,209
They want me to stop messing around,
settle down,

425
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,529
get married
with the next nice girl I meet.

426
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:28,941
They think it would be good for me.

427
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:31,412
Hmm. What do you think?

428
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:35,092
It sounds fucking awful.

429
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,577
But since they're right
about most things,

430
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:41,569
- they're probably right about that, too.
- Hmm.

431
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:43,971
You don't fancy getting married, do you?

432
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,895
Suzy.

433
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,021
Bravo!

434
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,293
Hey, hey, hey!

435
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:20,773
- What's going on with him?
- Nothing. Nothing.

436
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:22,541
Didn't want to ruin your day.

437
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:25,531
It's... It's the Kraut.

438
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,380
What about him?

439
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,169
He's just been signed by Ferrari.

440
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:33,891
You're kidding me?
Jesus. How did that happen?

441
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,660
Did he buy his way in there, too?

442
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:41,409
Well, the old man took Regazzoni back
and he insisted on it, apparently.

443
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,378
He says that Niki's a genius
setting up the cars.

444
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,454
It's terrible. Drives like a pig.

445
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,657
- Oh, you can't say that.
- Why not?

446
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:10,058
- It's a Ferrari!
- It's a shitbox.

447
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:13,969
It understeers like crazy and
the weight distribution is a disaster.

448
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:17,019
It's amazing, all these facilities
and you make a piece of crap like this.

449
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:19,849
Uh!

450
00:28:27,087 --> 00:28:31,087
We are happy
to welcome back to the Ferrari family...

451
00:28:31,427 --> 00:28:33,547
our good friend Clay Regazzoni,

452
00:28:33,927 --> 00:28:35,967
and to introduce Niki Lauda,

453
00:28:36,597 --> 00:28:37,677
from Austria.

454
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:51,729
"Ferrari family."
"Our good friend Clay Regazzoni."

455
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,289
You are family and friend
to the commendatore as long as you win.

456
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:56,701
The minute you don't, ciao, ciao.

457
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:01,140
I totally understand. It's business.
I would do the same.

458
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:04,249
But it isn't
just business, is it? What we do.

459
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,409
It's passion, love.

460
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:09,249
Which is why we are prepared
to risk our lives for it.

461
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,369
Not me.

462
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:13,091
If I had more talent and could earn
better money with something else,

463
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:14,929
I would.

464
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:18,609
How do you know you will
make money here? You haven't yet.

465
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:20,931
Not yet, but I will.

466
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,499
If you can, I can.

467
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:29,213
You know, are you ever not an asshole?

468
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,609
- Why am I an asshole?
- Well...

469
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:34,209
You know, by now
I'm both quicker than you

470
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,129
and better at setting up the car.

471
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,969
You can't deal with it,
so you're the asshole.

472
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,131
Screw you.

473
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:50,329
I brought you along today because
you seem like a lonely kind of guy.

474
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,289
I thought if I introduced you
to some nice people,

475
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,169
that could rub off on you.

476
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:56,889
Forget it. Make your own friends.

477
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:59,575
Come on, Clay. I'm sorry.

478
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:36,535
Are you leaving?

479
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:39,061
Yes.

480
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:41,289
Can you give me a lift
to the nearest town,

481
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,735
anywhere with a train station?

482
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:47,613
Sure. Trento's half an hour's drive.

483
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,297
Get in.

484
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:04,097
<i>Been another blue day
without you, girl</i>

485
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:08,737
<i>Been another sad summer song</i>

486
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:14,495
<i>I been thinking about you, girl,
all night long</i>

487
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:17,531
What are you doing?

488
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,531
You hear that noise when you accelerate?

489
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:22,217
- No.
- Your fan belt is loose.

490
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,089
My What?

491
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:26,569
And when you brake,
your foot goes all the way down,

492
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,090
which means there's air in the system.

493
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,901
- Anything else?
- No.

494
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,655
Apart from
the rear brakes are worn out,

495
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,449
the front right tyre's a bit soft,

496
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:38,249
which explains
why you're weaving so much.

497
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,730
Hmm. How can you tell?

498
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:43,058
- My ass.
- Sorry?

499
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:45,169
God gave me an okay mind,

500
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,901
but a really good ass,
which can feel everything in a car.

501
00:31:48,185 --> 00:31:50,529
You don't know what
you're talking about. This car is fine.

502
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:53,329
- I just had a service a week ago.
- Not a good one.

503
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,981
Yes, a very good one, very expensive.

504
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:58,689
This car is as good as new. Relax.

505
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,529
Not in a hurry, are you?

506
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,289
No. As long as I'm back

507
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:10,621
in Maranello Monday morning.

508
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:12,940
We can speak German.

509
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,369
- You're from Vienna, aren't you?
- <i>Ja.</i>

510
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,650
- Marlene.
- Niki.

511
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:32,932
How do you know Curd?

512
00:32:33,377 --> 00:32:34,497
Who's Curd?

513
00:32:34,837 --> 00:32:36,797
Curd Jürgens, the host.

514
00:32:37,417 --> 00:32:40,337
He is, or was, my boyfriend.

515
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:44,797
There is something very attractive
about an older man.

516
00:32:45,137 --> 00:32:46,530
But when they behave
like a frightened child...

517
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:49,425
I must have been mad.

518
00:32:51,925 --> 00:32:53,135
<i>Let me do this.</i>

519
00:32:53,475 --> 00:32:57,185
Otherwise we'll never get out of here.
We're in Italy, after all.

520
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:18,057
Not bad, eh?
Three seconds. Admit it, you're impressed!

521
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:25,821
<i>Mi scusi... Tu sei Niki Lauda?</i>

522
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,969
Yes.

523
00:33:36,477 --> 00:33:37,810
Do you need a lift?

524
00:33:37,810 --> 00:33:39,289
- Actually, we do, yeah.
- Okay.

525
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,569
It's my honour, Niki, please.

526
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:42,811
- Thank you.
- My car is your car.

527
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:46,729
On one condition, though.
It's a piece of shit. It's dog shit.

528
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:49,813
But if you drive it,
you make my life, Niki, eh?

529
00:33:55,997 --> 00:33:59,537
No one will believe
Niki Lauda is driving my granny's car.

530
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:04,778
- Niki Lauda!
- Niki Lauda, Niki Lauda!

531
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:09,089
Will someone please tell me
what's going on?

532
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,609
Who are you? Should I know you?

533
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,100
What, you don't know?

534
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:16,689
He's Niki Lauda, Formula 1 driver,
and he just signed with Ferrari.

535
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,180
- Him?
- Yes.

536
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,497
- Impossible.
- Why?

537
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:25,169
Well, you know, Formula 1 drivers,
they have long hair, are sexy,

538
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,689
their shirts are open to here.

539
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,449
- Thank you.
- Yes.

540
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:31,852
Anyway, look at the way he's driving,
like an old man.

541
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:37,610
There's no need to drive fast.

542
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:39,892
It just increases
the percentage of risk.

543
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,451
We're not in a hurry.
I'm not being paid.

544
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:45,889
Right now,
with zero incentive or reward,

545
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:47,654
why would I drive fast?

546
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:51,492
Because I'm asking you to.

547
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:57,009
And do you always get what you want?

548
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:58,341
<i>Ja.</i>

549
00:34:58,727 --> 00:35:00,057
Usually.

550
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:57,049
<i>This is an incredible battle</i>

551
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:59,529
<i>between Niki Lauda in the red Ferrari</i>

552
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:02,056
<i>and James Hunt in the white Hesketh.</i>

553
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,729
...the challenge of Niki Lauda...

554
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,249
<i>Lauda attacking Hunt.</i>

555
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,059
<i>Lauda gets through on the inside.</i>

556
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:09,695
<i>Goes wide at the exit.</i>

557
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:11,409
<i>Hunt is past again.</i>

558
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:14,569
<i>Once more
Lauda tries to sneak up the inside.</i>

559
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:18,649
<i>They're absolutely side by side,
wheel to wheel.</i>

560
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:22,729
<i>So evenly matched. Fantastic battle
between these two great drivers.</i>

561
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:25,097
<i>Hunt is now ahead once more.</i>

562
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:31,249
<i>But Lauda's coming back again now.
Lauda once more sneaks up the inside.</i>

563
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,730
<i>And again he runs wide.
Again the Hesketh...</i>

564
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:37,053
- Suzy, we're ready, come on.
- Just... Just one second.

565
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,581
- Can we go, yeah?
- Okay, yeah.

566
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:44,169
<i>We're in the closing laps
of this race here at Watkins Glen.</i>

567
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,171
<i>They come down the hill.</i>

568
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,609
<i>And Hunt's got a problem!</i>

569
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:51,089
<i>Hunt pulls across to the left.</i>

570
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:53,934
<i>Lauda goes ahead on his own.</i>

571
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:58,090
<i>A sad end to a wonderful battle.</i>

572
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:00,781
<i>Hunt pushing off the marshal.</i>

573
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:13,295
<i>The chequered flag
is waiting for Lauda and for Ferrari.</i>

574
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:17,449
<i>The title going to Niki Lauda,</i>

575
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:18,969
<i>who wins the race,</i>

576
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,450
<i>who wins the World Championship.</i>

577
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,815
Do I look like a racing driver now?

578
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:06,260
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

579
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:08,529
Marlene.

580
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:13,889
With a car like that, the rest of us
never really stood a chance, did we?

581
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:16,860
Maybe the fact the car is so good
has something to do with me.

582
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:19,860
Come on, Niki. You're in a Ferrari.
I'm in a Hesketh.

583
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:21,929
Equal terms,
the way it was in Formula 3,

584
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:24,376
- I'd beat you and you know it.
- Never.

585
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:27,380
You might win one race, maybe two,
because you're aggressive.

586
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:30,693
But in the long run, over the course
of a season, no chance.

587
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:31,857
Right. Why's that?

588
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:34,861
Because to be a champion,
it takes more than just being quick.

589
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,769
- It's the whole picture.
- Oh.

590
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,809
You're just a charger and a party guy.

591
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,050
That's why everybody likes you.

592
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:42,729
Try saying that
and tell me you're not jealous.

593
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:46,695
Why would I be jealous? Think about it.

594
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:49,209
All that affection, all those smiles

595
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:51,049
- is a sign of disrespect.
- Oh.

596
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:53,569
They don't fear you.
Whereas compare that to me.

597
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:56,221
Yes, compared to you, whom no one likes.

598
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:57,969
- Right.
- Not even his own teammates.

599
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:00,735
Right. Because I'm a serious guy.

600
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:03,251
I go to bed early,
I look after myself, look after my car.

601
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:06,419
- Yes, you're very well-behaved.
- Go to work, kick ass.

602
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:09,261
And then, after the race,
I go home instead of going to bars

603
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:12,569
and talk all this bullshit
with all these assholes.

604
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,489
Arseholes?

605
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:16,936
You should go home more often, too.

606
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,252
I heard you got married.

607
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:24,854
Yes, I did.

608
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:29,016
So where is she, this mysterious wife?

609
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:32,212
- In New York, working.
- Oh.

610
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,609
You know,
I've never seen you with her once.

611
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:36,850
No?

612
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,169
Well, maybe that's because
you're always at home,

613
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:46,095
on your own, looking after yourself,
being a good little boy.

614
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:51,621
Take a drink on me, James.

615
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:56,136
Thank you, Niki. I might just have two.

616
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,009
Right, Bubbles,

617
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:12,139
whatever it takes to beat
that prick next year, just say it.

618
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,661
Your word is my command.

619
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:17,252
There are no lengths
to which I will not go. I mean it.

620
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,653
What the hell's going on?

621
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:26,416
Where is everybody? What's the matter?

622
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:34,569
Do you know what the date is today?

623
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:37,016
Yes, it's November, the 14th. Why?

624
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:41,694
Do you have any idea
of the significance of that date?

625
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:46,173
I don't know.
Time to start killing pheasants?

626
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:51,329
Actually, it's the deadline
for securing sponsorship

627
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:53,253
for the forthcoming Formula 1 season.

628
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,935
Yes?

629
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:58,100
Which elapsed at midnight last night,
and we didn't attract any.

630
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:02,129
Well, so?
We aren't looking for sponsorship.

631
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:04,417
Like you said, condoms and cigarettes,
vulgar, right?

632
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,576
Right.

633
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:11,497
Except we are, or were.

634
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:16,736
I've made something of a miscalculation.

635
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:21,172
The economics, Formula 1,
realities thereof.

636
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:25,733
It turns out,
not like the lower divisions at all.

637
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,979
What are you saying?

638
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:34,370
I'm saying it's over, Superstar.

639
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:38,737
The banks have stepped in,
started laying everyone off.

640
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:42,931
Probably have to sell this place.

641
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,532
Oh, Christ.

642
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:29,936
I need a drive, Pete.
I need you to find me a drive.

643
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:31,895
I mean, what about Lotus?

644
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,455
You don't wanna know.

645
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:37,421
- Actually, I do.
<i>- Okay. Uh...</i>

646
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:41,772
They felt your reputation preceded you.

647
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:43,849
And what does that mean?

648
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:48,459
It's my other line.
Look, I'll get back to you.

649
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:51,451
Peter Hunt.

650
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:53,380
Fuck.

651
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:05,655
Don't worry. Something will turn up.

652
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:16,498
Doubt that will help in the meantime.

653
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:22,169
Why don't we go away at the weekend?

654
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:25,299
Skiing. Before I go back to New York.

655
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:32,332
Talk to me, James.
Don't make a stranger of me.

656
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:36,489
You know, Suzy,
only a stranger would invite me skiing

657
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:38,936
when they know
I haven't got a fucking drive.

658
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:47,094
I can't watch this.

659
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:50,171
What were you hoping for anyway?

660
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:53,009
A well-adjusted knight
in shining armour?

661
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:55,009
No danger of that.

662
00:43:55,010 --> 00:43:57,369
- Let me give you some advice.
- I'm all ears.

663
00:43:57,370 --> 00:44:00,209
Don't go to men who are willing
to kill themselves driving in circles

664
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:02,861
- looking for normality.
- I never expected normality.

665
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:05,129
God knows I walked into this
with my eyes open.

666
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:06,689
I just hoped I'd married someone

667
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:09,773
who was half as impressive
on the inside as he is on the outside.

668
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:11,689
At least there's something
behind the facade.

669
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,897
- Oh, James.
- Fuck off to New York, dear.

670
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:17,449
There must be a moisturiser
or an eye shadow somewhere

671
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:19,214
that needs your vapid mush to flog it.

672
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:57,409
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, James.</i>

673
00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:00,732
It's Peter. Something's up at McLaren.

674
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:03,409
<i>- What have you heard?</i>
- Nothing. Why?

675
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:05,936
I heard Emerson's off.
He's dumped them in it.

676
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:08,769
Jesus. Get me in there, Pete.

677
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:11,171
Say anything, just get me in that room.

678
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,929
I'll come straight to the point.

679
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:21,449
- Our esteemed lead driver...
- Fitti-fucking-paldi.

680
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:23,769
...has ditched us for another team
at the last minute.

681
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:26,129
- Coper-fucking-sucar.
- And we need a replacement.

682
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:27,620
ASA-fucking-P.

683
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:32,456
Fortunately, a few hands
have already gone up, good people.

684
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:35,975
- Jacky Ickx.
- I'm quicker than Jacky.

685
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:40,369
- But he's consistent, dependable.
- A grown-up.

686
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:43,817
Right, and will he go for that gap
when no one else will?

687
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:45,898
Will he put his life on the line
the day that it really matters?

688
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:47,655
The sponsors like him.

689
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:50,369
What do you want,
a driver or a brush salesman?

690
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:52,290
- We wanna be successful.
- Yes, so do I.

691
00:45:52,570 --> 00:45:55,569
But that means beating Niki Lauda,
not being a show pony for sponsors.

692
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:57,129
I heard about this thing with Niki.

693
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:58,336
Everyone has.

694
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:02,049
- You really think you can beat him?
- I'd beat him in a McLaren.

695
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:05,338
It's the only car out there
as quick as the Ferrari.

696
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:07,652
Which is why I'm here, begging.

697
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:09,649
Look, I'll do whatever you ask.

698
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:11,493
I'll put on a tie,
I'll smile for sponsors,

699
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:13,499
say the right things.

700
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:16,131
I can beat this guy, trust me.

701
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:18,859
Just give me the drive.

702
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:21,459
<i>Yeah.
Yeah, he can be a loose cannon.</i>

703
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:23,329
And, yeah, he will drive you all mad,

704
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:26,857
but in terms of raw talent
and right stuff,

705
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:28,859
there is no better driver in the world.

706
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:31,412
<i>He's the real thing, Teddy.</i>

707
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:34,064
<i>- He's what we all came into this for.</i>
- Mmm.

708
00:46:34,065 --> 00:46:36,169
Nine days out of ten
you'll be pulling your hair out,

709
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:39,369
but on that tenth day,
James will be unbeatable.

710
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:41,372
And that is the day you will wish
you had him in your car.

711
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:44,494
<i>You will never win the championship
with Jacky Ickx.</i>

712
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:47,289
You just might with James.

713
00:47:09,345 --> 00:47:11,849
Welcome to São Paulo, Brazil,
and the Interlagos circuit

714
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:15,491
for the first race
in the 1976 Formula 1 season,

715
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:18,969
where the main news is that James Hunt
has qualified fastest,

716
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:21,052
beating Niki Lauda's Ferrari
to pole position

717
00:47:21,170 --> 00:47:23,901
by just two hundredths of a second.

718
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:26,494
New car.

719
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:28,980
- I noticed.
- Pole position.

720
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:31,409
I noticed that, too.

721
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:33,889
Level playing field now,
my ratty little friend.

722
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:37,569
Yeah. Let's see where we are
after lap one.

723
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:40,380
Let's see where we are
in five races' time.

724
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:43,409
Hunt has the pit lane pole position,

725
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:46,220
which should give him the best chance
of out dragging Lauda's Ferrari.

726
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:48,929
If ever there was a doubt about

727
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:52,249
whether Lauda had
a serious challenger to this season,

728
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:55,891
Hunt and his McLaren
have certainly given us the answer.

729
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:13,129
<i>Here in South Africa,</i>

730
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:15,132
<i>James Hunt is determined to make amends</i>

731
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:18,254
<i>after that disastrous retirement
in Brazil.</i>

732
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:22,809
<i>But it's Lauda who takes the flag
here at Kyalami.</i>

733
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:24,529
<i>James Hunt comes home second</i>

734
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:27,049
<i>to confirm his championship
challenge at last</i>

735
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:28,809
<i>and score his first points</i>

736
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:30,380
<i>of the season.</i>

737
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:34,816
That wind you can feel
is me breathing down your neck.

738
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:36,932
Next time I'll have you.

739
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:39,301
We'll see in Spain.

740
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:03,649
<i>James Hunt finally takes
his first victory of the season</i>

741
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:06,176
<i>here in Spain, after a brilliant drive.</i>

742
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:08,497
It was only a matter of time.

743
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:18,660
Luca, don't you think it's time
to tell them?

744
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:27,691
- It's too wide.
- Disqualified.

745
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,529
- What?
- You're disqualified.

746
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:32,214
How can we be disqualified?

747
00:49:32,330 --> 00:49:34,209
- 1.5 centimetres.
- It's the same car.

748
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:36,372
<i>Giustissimo.</i>

749
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:41,691
You fucking...

750
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:44,689
<i>...McLaren M23
has proved very controversial here.</i>

751
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:48,533
Just make it narrower. I don't care how.

752
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:50,729
New rear suspension.
New wishbones.

753
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:53,540
I wanna make sure
this thing is legal, no doubts.

754
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:56,129
Well, then we'd better move the
oil coolers back to the old position.

755
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:58,369
With the oil coolers back, the
wing brackets need to be changed, too.

756
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,569
Fuck.

757
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:01,729
What the fuck
d'you think we're doing?

758
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:13,889
<i>And with Hunt disqualified
from his Spain win,</i>

759
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:16,569
<i>his championship year is not going well.</i>

760
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:19,096
<i>And now it's all gone wrong
here at Monaco!</i>

761
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:21,409
<i>His engine is smoking.</i>

762
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:26,101
Smoke pouring
from the engine of that McLaren!

763
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:27,729
And James Hunt is out!

764
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:30,249
- Can you tell us what happened?
- Sure. It's magic.

765
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:32,489
We've taken a great car,
a great piece of engineering,

766
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:35,699
and overnight turned it into
a big, huge, stinking turd.

767
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:49,021
Shit!

768
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:54,769
What the hell have you done?
The car's evil.

769
00:50:54,770 --> 00:50:56,529
It's fucking undriveable!

770
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:58,449
James, look, if there's a problem
with the car we'll find it...

771
00:50:58,450 --> 00:51:00,529
The car is a piece of shit.
You should be appealing this.

772
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:02,578
- We are appealing it.
- We will sort it out.

773
00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:04,769
- They're killing us out there.
- Go and get your dick wet.

774
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,609
- You're a wanker.
- Fuck you.

775
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:08,449
- You're a fucking wanker.
- I will, arsehole.

776
00:51:09,665 --> 00:51:11,369
But this was a good race for you,
no, Niki?

777
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:12,451
It's good for everyone

778
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,459
that the quickest car
happens to be a legal car.

779
00:51:14,570 --> 00:51:17,301
James, you're 50 points
behind Lauda in the championship.

780
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:20,857
You've had another retirement today.
What's going wrong?

781
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:22,969
Oh, it's dirty politics
and dirty tricks,

782
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:24,381
that's what's going wrong.

783
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:27,049
<i>So, as we approach
the halfway point</i>

784
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:28,814
<i>in this year's Formula 1 season,</i>

785
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:32,649
<i>Ferrari and Niki Lauda
seem clearly on top,</i>

786
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:35,699
<i>and James Hunt and McLaren
are struggling.</i>

787
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:39,257
So, five races in,
how's it going so far?

788
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:42,893
It's fine. Just got a little problem
with an Austrian rat

789
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:44,649
and his team of Italian cheats

790
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:47,169
- who have destroyed my car.
- What are you talking about?

791
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:49,332
I'm talking about the race in Spain
that I won.

792
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:52,659
- Yeah, in a car which is not legal.
- Five-eighths of an inch too wide.

793
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:55,011
You know that doesn't have
the slightest effect on speed.

794
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:57,497
But you complained and your team
of lawyers leaned on the authorities.

795
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:00,849
Now we've had to rebuild the car,
and it's become a monster.

796
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:03,820
- At least it's a legal monster.
- You've had to resort to cheating.

797
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:07,691
You're driving an illegal car
and call me the cheat? It's pathetic.

798
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:11,089
- Rules are rules.
- Yes, and rats are rats.

799
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:12,171
Thank you. Thank you.

800
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:18,209
Do you really think it upsets me, James,

801
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:21,209
calling me a rat
because I look like one?

802
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:22,939
I don't mind it.

803
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:24,929
Rats are ugly, sure,
and nobody likes them,

804
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:28,689
but they're very intelligent and
they have a strong survival instinct.

805
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:30,374
- Wonderful.
- Marlene, <i>komm.</i>

806
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:32,049
Leave this jerk alone.

807
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:33,495
No wonder she left him.

808
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:52,860
Anyone seen Suzy?

809
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:57,049
She's supposed to be here today.

810
00:52:57,050 --> 00:53:00,213
We, er... didn't wanna tell you
before the race.

811
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:02,740
Tell me what?

812
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:09,535
Jesus.

813
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:35,775
Is that from him?

814
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:37,781
Yeah.

815
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:46,452
So when did all this start?

816
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:49,977
That weekend I went skiing.

817
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:55,057
Why have you come here, James?

818
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:57,055
I've come to get you back.

819
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:00,139
You don't want me back.

820
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:01,969
You never wanted to be married
in the first place.

821
00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:04,291
- Yes, I did.
- Oh, come on, James.

822
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:07,449
You did it because
you hoped it might change you,

823
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:09,134
settle you down, help with the racing.

824
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:10,901
No, I didn't.

825
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:13,289
And who knows?
If it had been just the drinking

826
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:17,129
or the dope or the infidelity
or the moods,

827
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:18,291
it might even have worked.

828
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:20,969
- But when it's all of them...
- Yes, I know, I'm terrible.

829
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:22,813
No, you're not terrible.

830
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:26,973
You're just who you are
at this point in your life.

831
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:30,974
God help anyone who wants more.

832
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:36,853
And Richard Burton,
will he able to give you more?

833
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:40,776
You know, he has quite
the bad boy reputation himself.

834
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:44,501
What's important is how it feels to me,

835
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:46,937
and it feels like he adores me.

836
00:54:53,025 --> 00:54:54,929
- James!
- New York Times!

837
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:56,449
Are you and Suzy getting back together?

838
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:59,449
- James, how do you feel...
- It's all very amicable.

839
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:02,009
My wife has found herself
a new backer...

840
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:04,609
I mean, lover, which makes her happy.

841
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:07,209
And Mr Burton has found
a way of feeling young again,

842
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:08,689
which makes him happy.

843
00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:11,049
Let's hope his pockets are deep.
They'll need to be.

844
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:14,369
And I've found a way to be single
and have an ex-wife

845
00:55:14,370 --> 00:55:16,129
without it costing me a penny,

846
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:18,369
which has got to go down
as the biggest win of my career.

847
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:21,101
I have a flight to catch.

848
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:51,489
<i>We haven't seen
this sort of intensity</i>

849
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:53,169
<i>from James Hunt all season long.</i>

850
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:56,169
Reports have been coming out
of the McLaren camp all week

851
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:59,652
that their car is now fully legal
and faster than ever.

852
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:11,538
Never mind the bloody wets.
We're still quick.

853
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:19,052
Hunt has really closed the gap on Lauda
as they head into Druids.

854
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:24,049
<i>Niki Lauda is under real pressure
from James Hunt</i>

855
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:26,701
<i>as they go up the hill
into Druids Corner.</i>

856
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:34,373
And Hunt is in front of Lauda!

857
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:43,255
<i>So James Hunt gets the plaudits</i>

858
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:45,249
<i>of the crowd, the first Briton to win</i>

859
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:46,900
<i>a British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch</i>

860
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:48,899
<i>since Jim Clark in 1964.</i>

861
00:57:52,425 --> 00:57:54,569
James, at the moment
you've got a terrific edge

862
00:57:54,570 --> 00:57:57,540
over the rest of the field.
How have you achieved this advantage?

863
00:57:57,930 --> 00:57:59,609
Big balls.

864
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:01,100
Would you...

865
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:04,289
<i>Following an inquiry
into the disqualification</i>

866
00:58:04,290 --> 00:58:06,691
<i>of driver James Hunt
from the Spanish Grand Prix,</i>

867
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:08,289
<i>it has been decided</i>

868
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:10,289
<i>- to overturn this disqualification...</i>
- Yes!

869
00:58:10,290 --> 00:58:13,769
<i>...and to restore his victory
and reinstate his points.</i>

870
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:21,449
James! James!

871
00:58:21,450 --> 00:58:23,259
James, a few weeks ago
you were out of the running

872
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:25,289
for the season completely,
and now you're right back in it.

873
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:28,289
- What's changed?
- Well, it's a combination of factors

874
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:30,449
not all of which I'm prepared
to discuss here

875
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:34,774
but justice being done
re the disqualification in Spain helps,

876
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:37,336
and having my car
back at its best again.

877
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:39,966
In theory it's possible

878
00:58:39,966 --> 00:58:42,211
for James Hunt to catch you.
Are you worried?

879
00:58:42,317 --> 00:58:43,527
Not at all.

880
00:58:43,527 --> 00:58:46,487
For him to catch me,
he would have to win a lot of races...

881
00:58:46,487 --> 00:58:48,930
and pigs would have to fly.

882
00:58:50,367 --> 00:58:53,247
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a family matter to attend to.

883
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:55,940
James! James!

884
00:59:05,330 --> 00:59:08,493
I should warn you.
I'm not going to be any good at this.

885
00:59:09,507 --> 00:59:12,217
"Bringing flowers" and "holding hands".

886
00:59:12,467 --> 00:59:16,057
I'll probably forget your birthday.

887
00:59:16,057 --> 00:59:19,397
But if I'm going to do this with anyone,

888
00:59:20,267 --> 00:59:22,937
it might as well be you.

889
00:59:24,397 --> 00:59:25,527
My God...

890
00:59:25,647 --> 00:59:27,737
a poet!

891
01:00:38,597 --> 01:00:40,887
What's the matter?

892
01:00:46,437 --> 01:00:49,107
Happiness is the enemy.

893
01:00:50,567 --> 01:00:52,487
It weakens you,

894
01:00:54,197 --> 01:00:56,447
puts doubts in your mind.

895
01:00:58,657 --> 01:01:01,997
Suddenly, you have something to lose.

896
01:01:09,007 --> 01:01:11,377
When you call happiness an enemy,

897
01:01:13,047 --> 01:01:15,717
then it's too late.

898
01:01:17,097 --> 01:01:19,727
Then you've already lost.

899
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:27,657
Welcome to the legendary Nürburgring.

900
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:30,253
This is a 14.2-mile track,

901
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:34,098
complete with 185 corners and bends.

902
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:11,289
Niki, an autograph?

903
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:12,701
Yep.

904
01:02:17,317 --> 01:02:18,827
With the date, please.

905
01:02:18,987 --> 01:02:20,327
The date? Why?

906
01:02:20,487 --> 01:02:22,537
You never know.
Could be your last.

907
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:34,969
<i>Welcome to the Nürburgring,</i>

908
01:02:34,970 --> 01:02:37,576
<i>The most dangerous circuit
on the season calendar.</i>

909
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:40,700
In Formula 1 it is known
as the Graveyard.

910
01:02:40,810 --> 01:02:42,539
The weather conditions
are far from ideal,

911
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:44,220
and latest reports indicate

912
01:02:44,330 --> 01:02:46,009
there is no relief in sight.

913
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:55,889
Gentlemen. Well, gentlemen,
please be quiet.

914
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:58,052
Thank you. Niki Lauda.

915
01:02:58,250 --> 01:02:59,775
Thank you.

916
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:03,893
I called this meeting because,
as all you drivers know,

917
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:06,209
the Nürburgring is the most stupid,
barbaric, outdated

918
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:07,729
and dangerous track in the world.

919
01:03:07,730 --> 01:03:10,049
You've all seen the rain
that has been falling today.

920
01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:13,769
Now, those of you with experience know
the ring needs perfect conditions

921
01:03:13,770 --> 01:03:16,421
to be even remotely acceptable
in terms of risk.

922
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:18,897
And today, with the rain,
it's anything but perfect,

923
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:22,169
so I called this meeting to
take a vote to cancel the race.

924
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:24,252
Cancel the race?

925
01:03:24,370 --> 01:03:26,409
There would be no change
to the situation

926
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:27,889
as far as points is concerned.

927
01:03:27,890 --> 01:03:30,609
- The race would simply be cancelled.
- This is bullshit.

928
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:32,929
If the race is cancelled,
none of us get our race fees.

929
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:37,369
That's true, you leave without your fee,
but you might leave with your life.

930
01:03:37,370 --> 01:03:41,614
It also means that you would
effectively win the championship.

931
01:03:42,050 --> 01:03:44,576
So, I can see why
this suits you just fine.

932
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:47,541
Why? There would be
no points for me either.

933
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:50,249
No, but there would be one race less

934
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:52,689
where I, or anyone else here,
could catch you.

935
01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:55,049
James is right. This is just tactics.

936
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:57,735
Maybe he's just frightened.

937
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:00,775
Which asshole said this?

938
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:09,619
Yes, of course I'm frightened,
and so are you.

939
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:15,569
I accept, every time I get in my car,
there is 20 per cent chance I could die,

940
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:17,140
and I can live with it,

941
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:19,289
but not one per cent more.

942
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:21,611
And today, with the rain,
the risk is more.

943
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:24,461
I suppose that all depends
on how good you are in the rain.

944
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:26,809
I have the track record here.

945
01:04:26,810 --> 01:04:29,769
I am the only person in history
to do the ring in under seven minutes.

946
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:32,455
So, actually, it's to my advantage
to race here today.

947
01:04:34,090 --> 01:04:36,491
Because I'm quicker than all of you.

948
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:40,818
- Come on.
- Fine. Then let's race.

949
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:44,817
- Come on, Niki, let's race.
- Gentlemen, please.

950
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:46,649
Why are we here, Niki? Come on.

951
01:04:52,850 --> 01:04:55,501
Well, all those in favour
of cancelling the race.

952
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:07,454
All those in favour of racing.

953
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:15,295
Gentlemen, the race is on.

954
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:24,291
- Ridiculous.
- What a waste of time.

955
01:05:25,690 --> 01:05:28,534
You know, Niki, every now and then
it helps if people like you.

956
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:47,049
In places
the track is still dangerously wet,

957
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:48,569
but following a drivers' meeting,

958
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:50,169
a decision has finally been taken.

959
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:51,409
The Grand Prix will go ahead.

960
01:05:51,410 --> 01:05:53,094
The race is going ahead.

961
01:05:57,330 --> 01:05:58,569
Niki!

962
01:05:58,570 --> 01:06:00,334
<i>One minute to go.</i>

963
01:06:09,850 --> 01:06:13,049
Jochen's going on slicks.
You wanna change?

964
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:15,609
- Is Niki gonna change?
- No.

965
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:17,692
Then we stay on wets, too.

966
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:27,294
- Niki, okay?
- I'm good.

967
01:06:29,770 --> 01:06:32,250
All right, fire her up.

968
01:06:45,464 --> 01:06:48,249
<i>This season's fight for
the Formula 1 World Championship</i>

969
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:51,929
<i>has so far been the story of two men.</i>

970
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:55,609
<i>Thus far, it's been going
pretty much the way of Niki Lauda.</i>

971
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:58,295
<i>But James Hunt
has qualified fastest here.</i>

972
01:06:58,410 --> 01:07:01,489
<i>He is on pole position
for the German Grand Prix,</i>

973
01:07:01,490 --> 01:07:04,573
<i>with Niki Lauda alongside
in the blood-red Ferrari.</i>

974
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:07,489
<i>It's a long race.</i>

975
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:10,141
If the track starts to dry out,

976
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:13,094
the wet-weather tyres
will no longer be as quick.

977
01:07:34,505 --> 01:07:36,609
Niki Lauda
and James Hunt, side by side

978
01:07:36,610 --> 01:07:39,773
on the front row of the grid,
go away absolutely as one.

979
01:07:53,970 --> 01:07:56,177
<i>Lauda very aggressive on Hunt there,</i>

980
01:07:56,290 --> 01:07:58,292
<i>forcing the McLaren onto the grass.</i>

981
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:04,129
<i>Lauda has the lead at the moment.</i>

982
01:08:04,130 --> 01:08:06,497
Lauda leads into the first corner.

983
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:08,658
<i>Hunt is in second place.</i>

984
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:15,969
<i>Mass storming past Hunt!</i>

985
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:18,655
<i>He made the right choice
to go with the dry-weather tyres.</i>

986
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:21,979
<i>Mass passing Lauda now!</i>

987
01:08:22,090 --> 01:08:26,015
<i>Jochen Mass, in the number 12 McLaren,
takes the lead!</i>

988
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:27,854
Jochen Mass the clear leader,

989
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:30,058
with everybody else making the decision

990
01:08:30,170 --> 01:08:32,329
to change tyres
after just one lap of this race.

991
01:08:32,330 --> 01:08:34,537
He's coming in! Come on, let's go!

992
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:46,740
See? I told you to go on slicks.
You should have taken my advice.

993
01:08:46,850 --> 01:08:48,689
Fuck off. Where's Niki?

994
01:08:48,690 --> 01:08:51,375
Behind you.
He made the same mistake.

995
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:05,859
Come on!

996
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:10,219
Come on! What's going on?

997
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:15,089
The tyre-changing frenzy has caused
a huge reshuffling of the pack,

998
01:09:15,090 --> 01:09:18,060
- with Jochen Mass in the lead now.
- You're clear. Go!

999
01:09:18,610 --> 01:09:19,736
Quick!

1000
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:23,049
Lauda urging his mechanics to hurry.

1001
01:09:23,050 --> 01:09:24,211
Quicker, quicker, quicker!

1002
01:09:25,970 --> 01:09:28,052
It's a disaster! Come on!

1003
01:09:39,610 --> 01:09:41,180
What's going on, you assholes?

1004
01:10:04,930 --> 01:10:07,169
This race has gone wrong for him so far.

1005
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:10,617
<i>His championship rival, James Hunt,
is a long way up the road.</i>

1006
01:10:21,490 --> 01:10:22,969
<i>Lauda passing car after car.</i>

1007
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:26,452
<i>He's just going past
Mario Andretti's Lotus there.</i>

1008
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:15,172
Niki!

1009
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:22,252
Get me out! Help me!

1010
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:25,410
<i>We have an accident
on the course. Red flags are out.</i>

1011
01:11:25,690 --> 01:11:29,490
<i>Several cars are involved. Looks like
it might be one of the Ferraris.</i>

1012
01:11:36,690 --> 01:11:39,057
- Come this way.
- Come on, come on!

1013
01:11:51,290 --> 01:11:52,769
Keep trying.

1014
01:12:00,370 --> 01:12:02,010
- Come this way.
- Okay.

1015
01:12:07,747 --> 01:12:14,377
<i>News is reaching us that Niki Lauda
was involved in the accident.</i>

1016
01:12:14,457 --> 01:12:20,427
<i>He is being flown by helicopter
to Mannheim hospital with severe burns.</i>

1017
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:57,980
<i>It's not
the burns to his face that are the danger.</i>

1018
01:12:59,047 --> 01:13:01,047
<i>It's the burns to his lungs.</i>

1019
01:13:03,797 --> 01:13:06,025
In the
intensive care unit,

1020
01:13:06,025 --> 01:13:09,081
six doctors and thirty-four
nurses are on duty for him.

1021
01:13:10,267 --> 01:13:13,557
But his condition is far worse
than originally feared.

1022
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:43,809
<i>The flood, which swept
down Big Thompson Canyon in Colorado,</i>

1023
01:13:43,810 --> 01:13:45,529
<i>was the worst since records began.</i>

1024
01:13:45,530 --> 01:13:48,129
<i>In Formula 1 today,
victory celebrations were muted</i>

1025
01:13:48,130 --> 01:13:51,969
<i>after a horrific accident involving
world champion Niki Lauda.</i>

1026
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:53,969
<i>Due to safety concerns before the race,</i>

1027
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:56,369
<i>the Austrian had said
he would not take part,</i>

1028
01:13:56,370 --> 01:13:57,860
<i>but in the end he did.</i>

1029
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:01,537
<i>He was making up for lost time
when he went off the track,</i>

1030
01:14:01,650 --> 01:14:04,017
<i>puncturing the Ferrari's fuel tank.</i>

1031
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:06,697
<i>Brett Lunger was unable to
avoid the flaming wreck,</i>

1032
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:09,849
<i>but was unhurt and joined with
the other drivers to rescue Lauda,</i>

1033
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:12,740
<i>who was taken to Mannheim Hospital
with severe burns,</i>

1034
01:14:12,850 --> 01:14:16,491
<i>the incident reminding us again
of the dangers of Formula 1.</i>

1035
01:14:16,610 --> 01:14:18,689
<i>Niki Lauda was trapped
for almost a minute</i>

1036
01:14:18,690 --> 01:14:21,341
<i>in a searing inferno
of 800-plus degrees.</i>

1037
01:14:30,170 --> 01:14:32,449
- Do we have any change this morning?
- No...

1038
01:14:32,450 --> 01:14:34,373
<i>Frau</i> Lauda. <i>Frau</i> Lauda?

1039
01:14:35,210 --> 01:14:37,372
He's awake and just spoke.

1040
01:14:38,977 --> 01:14:42,567
He said, "Tell the priest to fuck off!
I'm still alive!"

1041
01:14:42,737 --> 01:14:44,397
You can go in.

1042
01:16:06,147 --> 01:16:10,737
<i>James Hunt gains on the absent Niki Lauda.</i>

1043
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:19,977
<i>We need to vacuum the lungs.</i>

1044
01:16:20,756 --> 01:16:23,450
<i>I should warn you. It won't be easy.</i>

1045
01:17:32,527 --> 01:17:33,907
Do it again.

1046
01:17:34,157 --> 01:17:38,311
Are you sure?
The lungs will already be bruised.

1047
01:18:09,330 --> 01:18:11,094
- Niki...

1048
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:22,327
Please, stop.

1049
01:18:23,327 --> 01:18:26,877
I know what you're thinking,
but please...

1050
01:18:28,207 --> 01:18:31,507
If you love me, you won't say a word.

1051
01:19:08,130 --> 01:19:10,019
- Morning, chaps.
- Hey, here's the man.

1052
01:19:10,210 --> 01:19:11,860
Looking good.

1053
01:19:15,090 --> 01:19:17,969
- What's going on?
- Jesus. It's Niki.

1054
01:19:17,970 --> 01:19:20,018
- What about him?
- He's here.

1055
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:21,855
- What?
- He's racing.

1056
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:38,860
Niki.

1057
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:47,015
It's that bad, huh?

1058
01:19:48,330 --> 01:19:49,741
No.

1059
01:19:50,610 --> 01:19:53,609
In hospital I asked them straight,
no bullshit,

1060
01:19:53,610 --> 01:19:55,453
how bad my appearance would be.

1061
01:19:56,690 --> 01:19:59,057
They said with time it would be fine.

1062
01:19:59,930 --> 01:20:01,534
But it won't.

1063
01:20:02,450 --> 01:20:05,294
I can tell, seeing your reaction.

1064
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:09,254
I will spend the rest of my life
with a face that frightens people.

1065
01:20:13,370 --> 01:20:17,136
You know, Niki, I tried to write you
a letter at the time, to apologise.

1066
01:20:18,770 --> 01:20:21,250
The drivers' meeting in Germany,
before the race.

1067
01:20:21,370 --> 01:20:23,896
- I swayed the room.
- Yes, you did.

1068
01:20:24,090 --> 01:20:26,297
That race should never have gone ahead.

1069
01:20:27,050 --> 01:20:28,654
No, it shouldn't.

1070
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:32,809
So, in many ways, I feel responsible
for what happened, and...

1071
01:20:32,810 --> 01:20:34,380
You were.

1072
01:20:36,050 --> 01:20:37,779
But, trust me...

1073
01:20:38,930 --> 01:20:42,980
watching you win those races
while I was fighting for my life...

1074
01:20:45,290 --> 01:20:48,499
...you were equally responsible
for getting me back in the car.

1075
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:18,935
- How are you feeling, Niki?
- Fine.

1076
01:21:19,330 --> 01:21:22,969
Niki, can you confirm to us exactly
which procedures you've had

1077
01:21:22,970 --> 01:21:24,972
and the expectations for your recovery?

1078
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:26,975
Sure.

1079
01:21:27,130 --> 01:21:28,969
I had a skin graft operation,

1080
01:21:28,970 --> 01:21:31,291
where they put half my right thigh
in my face.

1081
01:21:33,490 --> 01:21:38,329
Now, it doesn't look too good,
but one unexpected advantage is

1082
01:21:38,330 --> 01:21:40,689
it's impossible to perspire
through a skin graft,

1083
01:21:40,690 --> 01:21:44,129
so sweat will never run into my eyes
again, which is good for a driver.

1084
01:21:46,330 --> 01:21:48,009
When they heard about your condition,

1085
01:21:48,010 --> 01:21:51,457
Ferrari immediately hired
a replacement driver, Carlos Reutemann.

1086
01:21:52,130 --> 01:21:56,169
Yeah, before even reaching the hospital.

1087
01:21:56,170 --> 01:21:58,218
Is Reutemann
driving today, too?

1088
01:21:58,650 --> 01:22:01,654
Yes, and keen to make an impression.

1089
01:22:01,850 --> 01:22:05,849
So, let's see where Mr Reutemann
finishes and where I finish today.

1090
01:22:07,370 --> 01:22:10,055
James Hunt and McLaren have
caught up a lot while you were away.

1091
01:22:10,690 --> 01:22:12,180
Yes.

1092
01:22:12,810 --> 01:22:15,809
So is there a question now,
or are you just trying to piss me off?

1093
01:22:19,090 --> 01:22:20,819
You still think you can win?

1094
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:23,049
Yes, of course.

1095
01:22:23,050 --> 01:22:25,052
I have the better car.

1096
01:22:25,170 --> 01:22:27,650
And possibly I'm the better driver.

1097
01:22:27,850 --> 01:22:30,329
But he's a clever guy,
and he's used his time well

1098
01:22:30,330 --> 01:22:34,380
while I was lying half-dead in hospital
to win some points.

1099
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:39,015
And what did your wife say
when she saw your face?

1100
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:48,769
She said, "Sweetie,
you don't need a face to drive."

1101
01:22:48,770 --> 01:22:50,898
"You just need a right foot."

1102
01:22:51,210 --> 01:22:53,577
I'm being serious.

1103
01:22:53,770 --> 01:22:58,253
Do you really think your marriage can
survive with the way you look now?

1104
01:23:00,890 --> 01:23:02,938
And I'm being serious, too.

1105
01:23:03,930 --> 01:23:06,900
Fuck you. Press conference over.

1106
01:23:11,585 --> 01:23:13,929
- That was hairy.
- Well, you got noticed, Clive.

1107
01:23:13,930 --> 01:23:15,289
I'll tell you that.

1108
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:16,969
I thought it went well,
to be honest.

1109
01:23:16,970 --> 01:23:18,769
They don't like it
when it's not going their way.

1110
01:23:18,770 --> 01:23:20,454
- Clive.
- That's the game.

1111
01:23:20,570 --> 01:23:22,889
- See you.
- See you later.

1112
01:23:22,890 --> 01:23:24,779
- James, are you all right?
- Good, yeah.

1113
01:23:24,890 --> 01:23:26,649
Listen, I think
I've got something for you

1114
01:23:26,650 --> 01:23:28,449
on that last question, about Niki.

1115
01:23:28,450 --> 01:23:31,056
You heard about that?
I did.

1116
01:23:32,290 --> 01:23:34,019
James.

1117
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:42,821
Please, James...

1118
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:46,734
Now go home to your wife
and ask her how you look.

1119
01:23:49,170 --> 01:23:50,581
Prick.

1120
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:12,331
So Niki Lauda, just 42 days after
his near-fatal accident at Nürburgring,

1121
01:24:12,450 --> 01:24:14,009
will race here today at Monza

1122
01:24:14,010 --> 01:24:17,776
against all medical advice
and no doubt in incredible pain.

1123
01:24:50,490 --> 01:24:52,209
<i>...Niki Lauda!</i>

1124
01:25:00,850 --> 01:25:03,251
<i>Photographers,
please clear the grid.</i>

1125
01:25:03,490 --> 01:25:05,652
Niki, it's time.

1126
01:25:07,170 --> 01:25:08,660
Okay?

1127
01:25:15,330 --> 01:25:16,741
<i>Please clear the grid.</i>

1128
01:25:19,370 --> 01:25:21,498
<i>One minute to go.</i>

1129
01:25:58,827 --> 01:26:02,537
That's a bad start for Lauda,
he's slow away.

1130
01:26:07,290 --> 01:26:10,209
<i>The returning Niki Lauda
seems overwhelmed.</i>

1131
01:26:10,210 --> 01:26:12,656
<i>He's being overtaken by car after car.</i>

1132
01:26:15,490 --> 01:26:17,217
A terrible start for the Austrian.

1133
01:26:17,217 --> 01:26:19,557
<i>It's perhaps too soon for him
to be racing again.</i>

1134
01:26:22,450 --> 01:26:25,579
<i>Lauda's off line.
He runs wide onto the grass.</i>

1135
01:26:30,410 --> 01:26:32,094
<i>He wrestles it back onto the track,</i>

1136
01:26:32,290 --> 01:26:35,100
<i>but that was a bad moment for Niki.</i>

1137
01:26:38,970 --> 01:26:41,249
<i>Niki Lauda's the reigning
world champion,</i>

1138
01:26:41,250 --> 01:26:44,459
<i>but maybe in his current state
he's a danger out there,</i>

1139
01:26:44,610 --> 01:26:47,420
<i>to himself and to the rest of the field.</i>

1140
01:26:49,410 --> 01:26:53,301
<i>And Stuck has collided
with Mario Andretti's Lotus!</i>

1141
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:56,613
<i>Niki's boxed in. He's got nowhere to go.</i>

1142
01:27:11,050 --> 01:27:14,611
<i>Niki Lauda is actually
making a move. He's on Brambilla's tail.</i>

1143
01:27:17,890 --> 01:27:20,541
<i>He pulls out of the slipstream
to overtake.</i>

1144
01:27:21,290 --> 01:27:23,611
<i>Lauda's starting to find the form</i>

1145
01:27:23,730 --> 01:27:25,698
<i>that, early in this race,
we believed he'd lost.</i>

1146
01:27:32,130 --> 01:27:36,215
Lauda's now lapping faster than
Reutemann and closing the gap ahead.

1147
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:42,701
<i>Lauda closing on Carlos Reutemann,</i>

1148
01:27:42,810 --> 01:27:45,973
<i>the man called in to be his replacement
in the Ferrari team.</i>

1149
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:56,819
<i>And there's James Hunt's McLaren,</i>

1150
01:27:56,930 --> 01:27:59,376
<i>smoking stationary
by the side of the road.</i>

1151
01:28:03,010 --> 01:28:06,093
<i>This is bad news for Hunt's
championship hopes.</i>

1152
01:28:10,490 --> 01:28:11,901
<i>It's Ronnie Peterson</i>

1153
01:28:12,010 --> 01:28:14,377
<i>who comes home the winner here at Monza.</i>

1154
01:28:14,570 --> 01:28:17,460
<i>But all eyes are on the man
who finishes a brilliant fourth,</i>

1155
01:28:18,410 --> 01:28:20,538
<i>Niki Lauda!</i>

1156
01:29:01,410 --> 01:29:03,809
<i>What a race, what a man,
what a season.</i>

1157
01:29:03,810 --> 01:29:06,049
With a fourth-place finish
and three priceless points,

1158
01:29:06,050 --> 01:29:08,089
it means that Niki Lauda
is a major step closer

1159
01:29:08,090 --> 01:29:10,297
to retaining the World Championship.

1160
01:30:09,450 --> 01:30:13,009
<i>So, the long, gruelling
and incredibly dramatic season</i>

1161
01:30:13,010 --> 01:30:15,449
<i>comes down to this final race in Japan</i>

1162
01:30:15,450 --> 01:30:18,049
<i>in the shadow of Mount Fuji.</i>

1163
01:30:18,050 --> 01:30:19,529
<i>Niki Lauda goes into</i>

1164
01:30:19,530 --> 01:30:21,049
<i>this deciding race at Fuji</i>

1165
01:30:21,050 --> 01:30:23,289
<i>just three points ahead of James Hunt.</i>

1166
01:30:23,290 --> 01:30:27,579
<i>Hunt knowing he must beat the Austrian
fair and square to take the title.</i>

1167
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:32,689
James, do you think
you can cope with the pressure?

1168
01:30:32,690 --> 01:30:36,217
Well, I've never really understood
what that means. I love my job.

1169
01:30:36,330 --> 01:30:38,378
I love competing. I love racing.

1170
01:30:38,570 --> 01:30:40,489
<i>Maybe you should ask Niki.</i>

1171
01:30:40,490 --> 01:30:42,849
He's the World Champion.
He's got everything to lose.

1172
01:30:42,850 --> 01:30:45,249
Mr Lauda,
are you feeling pressure?

1173
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:47,696
Do I look like I'm feeling pressure?

1174
01:30:49,770 --> 01:30:53,900
I am World Champion, and on the verge
to become World Champion again.

1175
01:30:54,010 --> 01:30:56,089
Hunt now has the opportunity to win,

1176
01:30:56,090 --> 01:30:58,249
but it's not so easy
to become a champion.

1177
01:30:58,250 --> 01:31:01,379
You have to really believe it
to make it possible.

1178
01:31:01,530 --> 01:31:03,578
James, is there anything
you'd like to add?

1179
01:31:03,690 --> 01:31:07,689
If Niki is being tricky and getting
a kicky out of playing mind games...

1180
01:31:07,690 --> 01:31:10,057
...then fine, I'm flattered.

1181
01:31:10,170 --> 01:31:13,731
But the fact is, momentum is with me.
I've never felt better.

1182
01:31:13,850 --> 01:31:16,421
And I fully expect the next
press conference we will have

1183
01:31:16,530 --> 01:31:18,692
will be with me as World Champion.

1184
01:31:20,530 --> 01:31:23,049
How will you cope
with the weather, bad conditions?

1185
01:31:23,050 --> 01:31:26,609
Intermittent heavy rain
has been forecast here at Fuji today,

1186
01:31:26,610 --> 01:31:30,092
along with strong winds
and occasional fog

1187
01:31:30,210 --> 01:31:32,099
rolling in from the mountain.

1188
01:31:33,890 --> 01:31:36,609
<i>And so, with today's
Japanese Grand Prix to come,</i>

1189
01:31:36,610 --> 01:31:38,449
<i>Lauda's lead a mere three points.</i>

1190
01:31:38,450 --> 01:31:40,134
<i>What a way to finish the season.</i>

1191
01:31:40,730 --> 01:31:42,289
<i>Hunt or Lauda?</i>

1192
01:31:42,290 --> 01:31:45,294
<i>Well, the final chapter will unfold when
we bring you extended coverage...</i>

1193
01:31:45,410 --> 01:31:48,529
They've got to cancel the race.
It's lethal out there.

1194
01:31:48,530 --> 01:31:50,729
The race is going ahead.

1195
01:31:50,730 --> 01:31:52,649
Television rights have been sold
all around the world.

1196
01:31:52,650 --> 01:31:55,369
The showdown between you and Niki
is all anyone wants to see.

1197
01:31:55,370 --> 01:31:58,849
With heavy rain
continuing to fall here at Fuji,

1198
01:31:58,850 --> 01:32:00,932
a decision has finally been made.

1199
01:32:01,050 --> 01:32:05,049
The 1976 Japanese Grand Prix
will go ahead.

1200
01:32:05,050 --> 01:32:07,735
<i>All drivers
to your cars, please.</i>

1201
01:32:32,370 --> 01:32:33,781
<i>Five minutes to go.</i>

1202
01:33:16,970 --> 01:33:18,489
- All right?
- All right.

1203
01:33:18,490 --> 01:33:20,889
- Hold still.
- What the hell are you doing?

1204
01:33:20,890 --> 01:33:22,689
To let the condensation out.

1205
01:33:22,690 --> 01:33:25,489
- It'll also let the water in.
- Not if you're leading.

1206
01:33:25,490 --> 01:33:27,857
Trust me,
this race is all about the start.

1207
01:33:29,770 --> 01:33:32,341
- Need a hand here?
- Yeah, hold it, Teddy.

1208
01:33:46,810 --> 01:33:48,460
Okay, start the bastard.

1209
01:33:51,450 --> 01:33:53,100
Good luck, kid.

1210
01:33:54,490 --> 01:33:55,901
Good luck, James.

1211
01:34:35,450 --> 01:34:37,452
<i>Thirty seconds to go.</i>

1212
01:34:56,890 --> 01:34:59,129
<i>Electric tension here at Fuji.</i>

1213
01:34:59,130 --> 01:35:04,249
<i>80, 000 bedraggled race fans and
the racing grudge match of the decade.</i>

1214
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:06,449
<i>And there's Mario Andretti
in pole position,</i>

1215
01:35:06,450 --> 01:35:08,452
<i>James Hunt alongside him.</i>

1216
01:35:10,610 --> 01:35:12,609
<i>On Row 2 of the grid,</i>

1217
01:35:12,610 --> 01:35:14,569
<i>there is Niki Lauda,</i>

1218
01:35:14,570 --> 01:35:17,089
<i>and on Row 3 of the grid,
Jody Scheckter from South Africa</i>

1219
01:35:17,090 --> 01:35:18,609
<i>in the six-wheel Tyrrell.</i>

1220
01:35:18,610 --> 01:35:20,692
<i>Behind him,
the rest of the 25-car field.</i>

1221
01:35:38,530 --> 01:35:42,535
There's the flag, and finally
the Japanese Grand Prix is underway!

1222
01:35:54,770 --> 01:35:58,009
<i>In these conditions,
it must be almost impossible to drive</i>

1223
01:35:58,010 --> 01:36:00,012
<i>a 450-horsepower car.</i>

1224
01:36:27,170 --> 01:36:30,249
<i>And it's Andretti who has the lead,
but Hunt is attacking.</i>

1225
01:36:30,250 --> 01:36:33,289
<i>Hunt's going round
the outside of Andretti.</i>

1226
01:36:33,290 --> 01:36:34,929
<i>Niki Lauda following him through.</i>

1227
01:36:34,930 --> 01:36:37,695
<i>Hunt leads into the first right-hander.</i>

1228
01:37:20,225 --> 01:37:22,569
<i>Hunt comes through
to complete his first lap,</i>

1229
01:37:22,570 --> 01:37:24,049
<i>leading the field.</i>

1230
01:37:24,050 --> 01:37:26,178
<i>At least he has clear vision
in front of him.</i>

1231
01:37:26,290 --> 01:37:28,452
<i>Niki Lauda, behind him,
eating his spray.</i>

1232
01:37:47,930 --> 01:37:49,409
<i>Lauda is slowing.</i>

1233
01:37:49,410 --> 01:37:52,369
<i>Niki Lauda is bringing
the Ferrari number one into the pit.</i>

1234
01:37:54,050 --> 01:37:57,259
<i>Some sort of problem, we can't
imagine what, so early in the race.</i>

1235
01:38:03,570 --> 01:38:07,017
What's wrong with the car?
What's wrong with the car?

1236
01:38:08,170 --> 01:38:09,899
Niki, what's wrong with the car?

1237
01:38:10,250 --> 01:38:12,332
Nothing. Car's perfect.

1238
01:38:16,730 --> 01:38:19,169
- What are you doing?
- I'm stopping.

1239
01:38:19,170 --> 01:38:21,409
<i>His mechanics
are asking what the problem is.</i>

1240
01:38:21,410 --> 01:38:23,731
<i>But wait!
Niki Lauda's getting out of the car!</i>

1241
01:38:23,850 --> 01:38:25,529
This is sensational!

1242
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:28,454
The reigning World Champion,
Niki Lauda, is out of this race.

1243
01:38:29,370 --> 01:38:31,129
It's too dangerous.

1244
01:38:31,130 --> 01:38:34,339
Niki, you want me to say there was
a problem with the car, for the media?

1245
01:38:35,650 --> 01:38:37,140
No.

1246
01:38:37,530 --> 01:38:38,941
Tell them the truth.

1247
01:38:39,810 --> 01:38:41,380
<i>Now, what is happening?</i>

1248
01:38:41,490 --> 01:38:45,415
<i>They're talking to the team manager.
Lauda explaining something.</i>

1249
01:39:00,970 --> 01:39:04,329
<i>With Lauda out, James Hunt
knows he has to finish this race</i>

1250
01:39:04,330 --> 01:39:08,169
<i>in third place or higher
to be World Champion.</i>

1251
01:39:08,170 --> 01:39:10,929
<i>But the job's not done yet
for James Hunt.</i>

1252
01:39:10,930 --> 01:39:15,538
<i>In these dreadful conditions,
he still has to go the distance.</i>

1253
01:39:16,650 --> 01:39:18,493
<i>Fifteen laps to go here at Fuji.</i>

1254
01:39:18,610 --> 01:39:20,769
<i>James Hunt or Niki Lauda?</i>

1255
01:39:20,770 --> 01:39:23,929
<i>This extraordinary season
is not over yet.</i>

1256
01:39:23,930 --> 01:39:27,377
<i>In this treacherous final round,
can James Hunt hang on?</i>

1257
01:39:27,890 --> 01:39:29,809
<i>And the scoreboard tells a story.</i>

1258
01:39:29,810 --> 01:39:32,620
<i>Lap 58. Hunt in the lead.</i>

1259
01:39:34,610 --> 01:39:36,453
Oh, God, his tyres, they're blistering.

1260
01:39:37,865 --> 01:39:39,929
<i>Brambilla
very close behind now,</i>

1261
01:39:39,930 --> 01:39:41,898
<i>closing on him all the time now.</i>

1262
01:39:42,010 --> 01:39:45,249
<i>And he's trying to drive
inside James Hunt.</i>

1263
01:39:45,250 --> 01:39:47,776
<i>Hunt cuts across the orange March nose.</i>

1264
01:39:47,890 --> 01:39:50,249
<i>Hunt's not having that at all.
And he's spinning.</i>

1265
01:39:50,250 --> 01:39:53,489
<i>He missed Hunt there, but almost
took James Hunt out of the race</i>

1266
01:39:53,490 --> 01:39:55,929
<i>and out of the world championship.</i>

1267
01:39:55,930 --> 01:39:58,661
<i>Now we find Mario Andretti
closing on James Hunt.</i>

1268
01:40:03,210 --> 01:40:05,178
<i>Mario Andretti's going past Hunt!</i>

1269
01:40:05,650 --> 01:40:08,654
<i>Hunt is slowing. James Hunt
seems to have a problem.</i>

1270
01:40:14,490 --> 01:40:16,329
<i>Despite these wet conditions,</i>

1271
01:40:16,330 --> 01:40:18,059
<i>these wet-weather tyres
do wear extremely fast.</i>

1272
01:40:18,170 --> 01:40:20,298
Hunt's tyres, they've gone.

1273
01:40:20,530 --> 01:40:24,216
<i>Hunt nursing his car
back to the pit stop.</i>

1274
01:40:26,210 --> 01:40:28,258
<i>That back marker's going past Hunt.</i>

1275
01:40:40,690 --> 01:40:43,449
<i>Look at that left front tyre...
Right front tyre, sorry.</i>

1276
01:40:43,450 --> 01:40:46,613
<i>No tread on it at all.
And the other one is flat.</i>

1277
01:40:46,770 --> 01:40:48,898
Let's go! Let's go!

1278
01:40:53,450 --> 01:40:55,929
Okay? When did you break
your gear lever?

1279
01:40:55,930 --> 01:40:57,609
Nine or ten laps ago.

1280
01:40:57,610 --> 01:41:00,056
- Alastair, we need to lift it.
- Come on!

1281
01:41:00,170 --> 01:41:01,929
- At the front.
- Let's go.

1282
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:05,209
<i>Regazzoni's Ferrari
and Jacques Lafitte in the Ligier</i>

1283
01:41:05,210 --> 01:41:06,860
have gone ahead.

1284
01:41:06,970 --> 01:41:08,649
Come on, hurry!

1285
01:41:08,650 --> 01:41:11,769
You did it.
You're going to be World Champion!

1286
01:41:11,770 --> 01:41:13,289
Not yet.

1287
01:41:13,290 --> 01:41:17,129
<i>A few laps ago, James Hunt
was looking like champion elect.</i>

1288
01:41:17,130 --> 01:41:19,497
<i>Now it looks as though
it's all gone wrong for him.</i>

1289
01:41:20,930 --> 01:41:22,409
- James.
- Come on!

1290
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:23,929
- Listen.
- What?

1291
01:41:23,930 --> 01:41:26,249
Just go easy out there.

1292
01:41:26,250 --> 01:41:30,289
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying look after yourself.

1293
01:41:30,290 --> 01:41:32,249
We want you back in one piece.

1294
01:41:32,250 --> 01:41:35,689
You're too far back. There's
too many drivers in front of you.

1295
01:41:35,690 --> 01:41:39,695
- There's always next year.
- So that's it? It's over?

1296
01:41:40,090 --> 01:41:41,649
Clear!

1297
01:41:41,650 --> 01:41:43,175
James.

1298
01:41:44,850 --> 01:41:46,773
- Clear!
- Fuck it!

1299
01:41:50,690 --> 01:41:54,009
James Hunt rejoins the race
in sixth position.

1300
01:41:54,010 --> 01:41:57,901
<i>There are four laps left to go.
Surely no way back for the Brit now.</i>

1301
01:42:17,770 --> 01:42:19,104
Concentrate, Superstar.

1302
01:42:19,105 --> 01:42:21,009
<i>Just brings
it back under control.</i>

1303
01:42:21,010 --> 01:42:22,289
<i>Sliding the McLaren</i>

1304
01:42:22,290 --> 01:42:23,530
<i>on the very edge there.</i>

1305
01:42:25,450 --> 01:42:26,736
<i>Hunt's M23</i>

1306
01:42:26,850 --> 01:42:28,529
<i>twitching this way and that
under braking.</i>

1307
01:42:28,530 --> 01:42:29,930
And he almost loses it right there.

1308
01:42:30,050 --> 01:42:32,771
<i>Hunt on the tail
of Jacques Lafitte in the blue Ligier.</i>

1309
01:42:40,730 --> 01:42:42,141
Oh, don't do it, James.

1310
01:42:45,265 --> 01:42:47,209
<i>He's inches away
from the pit wall.</i>

1311
01:42:47,210 --> 01:42:49,019
<i>He's inches away from the Ligier.</i>

1312
01:42:58,050 --> 01:43:00,529
<i>James Hunt has made up another place,</i>

1313
01:43:00,530 --> 01:43:01,609
<i>but it's not enough,</i>

1314
01:43:01,610 --> 01:43:02,850
<i>and this race is running out.</i>

1315
01:43:11,890 --> 01:43:13,892
<i>And Watson has spun.
Watson has spun.</i>

1316
01:43:18,530 --> 01:43:21,369
<i>Hunt manages to weave his way
between that back marker</i>

1317
01:43:21,370 --> 01:43:23,449
<i>and the stationary Penske.</i>

1318
01:43:23,450 --> 01:43:25,529
He's catching Regazzoni

1319
01:43:25,530 --> 01:43:27,249
but, in these conditions,
it's one thing to catch up,

1320
01:43:27,250 --> 01:43:29,457
it's quite another to overtake.

1321
01:43:32,850 --> 01:43:36,980
<i>He's alongside Clay Regazzoni.
This could be the world championship.</i>

1322
01:43:45,410 --> 01:43:46,935
<i>He's got him!</i>

1323
01:43:47,397 --> 01:43:50,437
The scoreboard
still shows Hunt in 5th place.

1324
01:44:02,210 --> 01:44:04,369
<i>Hunt crosses the line.</i>

1325
01:44:04,370 --> 01:44:08,049
<i>Now, he needed to finish third to score
enough points to be World Champion,</i>

1326
01:44:08,050 --> 01:44:12,649
<i>and in the confusion here, we're being
told that he may have finished fifth.</i>

1327
01:44:12,650 --> 01:44:14,849
He finished fifth?

1328
01:44:14,850 --> 01:44:17,729
<i>Our lap charts
show Hunt in third place.</i>

1329
01:44:17,730 --> 01:44:19,729
<i>Well, if the scoreboard's right,</i>

1330
01:44:19,730 --> 01:44:22,329
<i>it means he's just missed out
on the championship.</i>

1331
01:44:22,330 --> 01:44:25,971
<i>Crushing defeat for Hunt
after such a heroic drive.</i>

1332
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:32,529
I can see the race stewards conferring,

1333
01:44:32,530 --> 01:44:34,249
examining the official lap charts.

1334
01:44:34,250 --> 01:44:36,651
<i>We're just going to have to wait
for their verdict here.</i>

1335
01:44:54,265 --> 01:44:55,929
Let's get you out of there, buddy.

1336
01:44:55,930 --> 01:44:58,089
I'm sorry, Teddy. I'm sorry.
I thought I could make up the ground.

1337
01:44:58,090 --> 01:45:00,249
Sorry? What are you talking about?
You did it.

1338
01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:03,089
- Did what?
- Jesus. You crazy bastard.

1339
01:45:03,090 --> 01:45:06,299
You came third. You got the points.
You're champion of the world!

1340
01:45:06,810 --> 01:45:10,053
<i>James Hunt
is now officially confirmed</i>

1341
01:45:10,170 --> 01:45:12,218
<i>as finishing third here in Japan,</i>

1342
01:45:12,850 --> 01:45:16,569
<i>and that means
he is champion of the world.</i>

1343
01:45:17,970 --> 01:45:23,329
<i>Our new World Champion,
James Hunt, by just one single point.</i>

1344
01:45:28,450 --> 01:45:29,940
<i>Did we really win?</i>

1345
01:45:34,010 --> 01:45:36,251
World bloody Champion!

1346
01:45:44,945 --> 01:45:47,009
Tell us, James,
what are you going to do now?

1347
01:45:47,010 --> 01:45:49,172
I shall be getting drunk.

1348
01:45:49,690 --> 01:45:52,489
It's wonderful,
an absolute dream...

1349
01:46:05,570 --> 01:46:07,254
Are you okay?

1350
01:46:09,367 --> 01:46:10,957
Fine.

1351
01:46:12,577 --> 01:46:14,327
No regrets.

1352
01:46:17,587 --> 01:46:19,417
Not one.

1353
01:46:39,410 --> 01:46:41,489
<i>And our special guest,</i>

1354
01:46:41,490 --> 01:46:43,333
<i>Formula 1 champion James Hunt.</i>

1355
01:47:06,730 --> 01:47:08,812
Wait. Come on.

1356
01:47:11,970 --> 01:47:13,529
<i>There's no better motor oil</i>

1357
01:47:13,530 --> 01:47:15,134
<i>than Havoline.</i>

1358
01:47:25,650 --> 01:47:27,649
Yes, me, too.
Where are we going?

1359
01:47:27,650 --> 01:47:29,184
Anywhere I want to go.

1360
01:47:29,185 --> 01:47:31,529
And I don't have to hijack it, either.

1361
01:47:31,530 --> 01:47:33,249
As long as I pay for it.

1362
01:47:33,250 --> 01:47:35,571
I'm starving.
Let's get some food.

1363
01:47:46,385 --> 01:47:48,489
- Where are we going?
- You lot go ahead.

1364
01:47:48,490 --> 01:47:50,458
I won't be a minute.

1365
01:47:56,370 --> 01:47:57,974
Good to see you.

1366
01:48:02,050 --> 01:48:04,451
I heard you were spending
more and more time in one of these.

1367
01:48:04,850 --> 01:48:06,818
Do you fly?
No.

1368
01:48:07,210 --> 01:48:08,700
I don't think they'd insure me.

1369
01:48:08,850 --> 01:48:10,693
You should try.
It's good for discipline.

1370
01:48:10,890 --> 01:48:13,370
You have to stay within the rules,
stick to regulations,

1371
01:48:13,490 --> 01:48:16,061
suppress the ego.
It helps with the racing.

1372
01:48:16,170 --> 01:48:19,209
And there I was thinking
you were about to wax lyrical

1373
01:48:19,210 --> 01:48:20,814
about the romance of flight.

1374
01:48:21,170 --> 01:48:22,740
No, that's all bullshit.

1375
01:48:23,890 --> 01:48:25,335
So, what brings you here?

1376
01:48:26,490 --> 01:48:29,049
A friend's wedding.
At least I think it was a wedding.

1377
01:48:29,050 --> 01:48:31,969
Might have been a birthday or something.
It's all a bit of a blur.

1378
01:48:31,970 --> 01:48:33,289
How about you? Have you been at Fiorano?

1379
01:48:33,290 --> 01:48:34,451
Pre-season testing.

1380
01:48:34,570 --> 01:48:36,569
- You're relentless.
- Thank you.

1381
01:48:36,570 --> 01:48:38,809
I'm not sure that was meant
as a compliment.

1382
01:48:38,810 --> 01:48:41,129
When do you start testing? Next week?

1383
01:48:41,130 --> 01:48:43,169
No. What, are you nuts?

1384
01:48:43,170 --> 01:48:44,969
I didn't just win
the biggest thing of my life

1385
01:48:44,970 --> 01:48:46,415
so I could get right back to work.

1386
01:48:47,730 --> 01:48:50,415
Why? You have to.

1387
01:48:50,730 --> 01:48:54,169
To prove to all the people who will
always say you just won it because...

1388
01:48:54,170 --> 01:48:57,572
Because of what?
Because of your accident?

1389
01:48:59,090 --> 01:49:01,138
Niki, is that other people,
or is that you?

1390
01:49:01,770 --> 01:49:04,929
I won, okay? On the all-important day,
when it came down to it,

1391
01:49:04,930 --> 01:49:07,849
we raced on equal terms,
equally good cars.

1392
01:49:07,850 --> 01:49:10,089
And I put my life on the line,
and I saw it through.

1393
01:49:10,090 --> 01:49:12,138
- And you call that winning?
- Yes.

1394
01:49:12,250 --> 01:49:14,332
The risks were totally unacceptable.

1395
01:49:14,850 --> 01:49:17,330
You were prepared to die.
To me, that's losing.

1396
01:49:17,450 --> 01:49:19,089
Yes, I was. I admit it.

1397
01:49:19,090 --> 01:49:21,969
I was prepared to die
to beat you that day.

1398
01:49:21,970 --> 01:49:24,940
And that's the effect you have on me.
You'd pushed me that far.

1399
01:49:25,050 --> 01:49:26,461
And it felt great.

1400
01:49:27,370 --> 01:49:29,769
I mean, hell,
isn't that what we're in this for?

1401
01:49:29,770 --> 01:49:33,138
To stare death in the face
and to cheat it?

1402
01:49:33,490 --> 01:49:37,290
Come on, there's nobility in that.
It's... It's like being knights.

1403
01:49:38,290 --> 01:49:40,054
You English, you're such assholes.

1404
01:49:41,010 --> 01:49:42,455
You know my position.

1405
01:49:42,730 --> 01:49:44,209
Twenty per cent risk.

1406
01:49:44,210 --> 01:49:48,009
No, no, no, Niki, don't bring the
percentages into this. Don't be a pro.

1407
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:50,661
The minute you do that,
you kill what's good about this.

1408
01:49:50,970 --> 01:49:52,734
You kill the sport.

1409
01:49:55,850 --> 01:49:57,500
James!

1410
01:49:57,810 --> 01:49:59,653
- James!
- Come on!

1411
01:50:02,650 --> 01:50:04,015
I've got to go.

1412
01:50:05,530 --> 01:50:07,498
Careful in this thing.

1413
01:50:08,530 --> 01:50:10,020
James.

1414
01:50:15,250 --> 01:50:19,016
You know, in hospital, the toughest part
of my treatment was the vacuum.

1415
01:50:19,330 --> 01:50:22,254
Pumping the shit out of my lungs.
It was hell.

1416
01:50:23,330 --> 01:50:25,253
And while doing it,
I was watching television.

1417
01:50:25,850 --> 01:50:28,689
- You winning all my points.
- Your points?

1418
01:50:28,690 --> 01:50:30,897
"That bastard Hunt," I would say.
"I hate that guy."

1419
01:50:31,450 --> 01:50:33,609
And then one day
the doctor came and said,

1420
01:50:33,610 --> 01:50:35,897
"Mr Lauda,
may I offer a piece of advice?"

1421
01:50:36,010 --> 01:50:39,769
"Stop thinking of it as a curse to
have been given an enemy in life."

1422
01:50:39,770 --> 01:50:42,009
"It can be a blessing, too."

1423
01:50:42,010 --> 01:50:44,775
"A wise man gets more from his enemies
than a fool from his friends."

1424
01:50:45,410 --> 01:50:47,697
And you know what? He was right.

1425
01:50:50,290 --> 01:50:54,089
Look at us. We were both
a pair of kids when we met.

1426
01:50:54,090 --> 01:50:55,929
Hot-headed jerks in Formula 3.

1427
01:50:55,930 --> 01:50:57,773
Disowned by our families.

1428
01:50:57,890 --> 01:50:59,255
Headed nowhere.

1429
01:51:00,370 --> 01:51:02,729
And now we're both
champions of the world.

1430
01:51:02,730 --> 01:51:04,141
It was not bad, huh?

1431
01:51:05,210 --> 01:51:07,209
No, it's not bad.

1432
01:51:07,210 --> 01:51:10,771
So, don't let me down now.
I need you busting my balls.

1433
01:51:11,210 --> 01:51:13,975
- Get back to work.
- I will, Niki, I will.

1434
01:51:14,730 --> 01:51:16,778
But I intend to enjoy myself first.

1435
01:51:17,130 --> 01:51:19,451
Some of life needs to be for pleasure.

1436
01:51:19,570 --> 01:51:22,969
What's the point of having
a million cups and medals and planes

1437
01:51:22,970 --> 01:51:25,132
if you don't have any fun?

1438
01:51:25,930 --> 01:51:27,659
How is that winning?

1439
01:51:28,730 --> 01:51:31,461
- James!
- We're gonna leave without you!

1440
01:51:31,970 --> 01:51:33,415
James!

1441
01:51:37,250 --> 01:51:38,661
I'll see you on race day, champ.

1442
01:51:40,410 --> 01:51:42,572
You will... champ.

1443
01:51:45,090 --> 01:51:46,854
You look good, Niki.

1444
01:51:47,410 --> 01:51:50,300
The only guy to have his face burnt off
and it be an improvement.

1445
01:51:57,130 --> 01:51:59,249
<i>Of course,
he didn't listen to me.</i>

1446
01:51:59,250 --> 01:52:00,769
<i>For James,</i>

1447
01:52:00,770 --> 01:52:02,969
<i>one world title was enough.</i>

1448
01:52:02,970 --> 01:52:04,489
<i>He had proved</i>

1449
01:52:04,490 --> 01:52:07,849
<i>what he needed to prove, to himself</i>

1450
01:52:07,850 --> 01:52:10,137
<i>and anyone who doubted him.</i>

1451
01:52:10,970 --> 01:52:12,859
<i>And two years later he retired.</i>

1452
01:52:13,130 --> 01:52:16,771
<i>When I saw him next in London
seven years later,</i>

1453
01:52:16,890 --> 01:52:19,018
<i>me as champion again,</i>

1454
01:52:19,130 --> 01:52:21,089
<i>him as broadcaster,</i>

1455
01:52:21,090 --> 01:52:25,493
<i>he was barefoot
on a bicycle with a flat tyre.</i>

1456
01:52:25,610 --> 01:52:28,454
<i>Still living each day like his last.</i>

1457
01:52:30,210 --> 01:52:31,700
<i>When I heard he'd died,</i>

1458
01:52:31,810 --> 01:52:34,177
<i>aged 45, of a heart attack,</i>

1459
01:52:34,290 --> 01:52:35,815
<i>I wasn't surprised.</i>

1460
01:52:36,810 --> 01:52:38,699
<i>I was just sad.</i>

1461
01:52:40,050 --> 01:52:41,969
<i>People always think of us as rivals,</i>

1462
01:52:41,970 --> 01:52:45,577
<i>but he was among the very few I liked,</i>

1463
01:52:46,890 --> 01:52:49,860
<i>and even fewer that I respected.</i>

1464
01:52:53,010 --> 01:52:55,741
<i>He remains the only person I envied.</i>
