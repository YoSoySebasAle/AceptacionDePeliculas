00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:46,707
Excuse me. I was looking
for the <i>Weekly Volcano</i> office.

3
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,374
I wish to see
Mr. Dashwood.

4
00:01:51,343 --> 00:01:55,015
A friend of mine desired me
to offer a story by her.

5
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,117
She... She wrote it.

6
00:01:57,249 --> 00:01:59,218
She'd be glad to write more
if this suits.

7
00:01:59,351 --> 00:02:01,021
Not a first attempt,
I take it.

8
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,824
No, sir. She has sold
to <i>Olympic</i> and Scandal,

9
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,893
and she got a prize for a tale
at the <i>Blarneystone Banner.</i>

10
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:08,695
A prize?

11
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:11,263
Yes.

12
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,533
Sit.

13
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,778
We'll take this.

14
00:02:59,478 --> 00:03:00,614
Oh, you will?

15
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:03,817
With alterations.
It's too long.

16
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,153
Um, but you've cut...

17
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:10,322
I took care to have
a few of my sinners repent.

18
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,324
The country just
went through a war.

19
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,796
People want to be amused,
not preached at.

20
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,831
Morals don't sell nowadays.

21
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:20,934
Perhaps mention that
to your friend.

22
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:26,372
What compensation...?
How do you...?

23
00:03:26,505 --> 00:03:28,809
We pay 25 to 30
for things of this sort.

24
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:31,144
- We'll pay 20 for that.
- Oh.

25
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,616
You can have it.
Make the edits.

26
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,525
Should I tell my...
uh, my friend

27
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,129
you'll take another
if she had one better than this?

28
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,865
We'll look at it. Tell her
to make it short and spicy.

29
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,733
And if the main character's
a girl,

30
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:56,502
make sure she's married
by the end.

31
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:59,172
- Or dead. Either way.
- Excuse me?

32
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:02,474
What name would she like
put to the story?

33
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:06,313
Oh, uh, yes.
None at all, if you please.

34
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:08,148
Just as she likes,
of course.

35
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:10,449
Oh, well, heh...

36
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:14,054
Good morning, sir. Good day.

37
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,655
Yes!

38
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,295
My Beth would
like you very much.

39
00:04:55,427 --> 00:04:56,763
I'd like a room for two.

40
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:59,065
Perfect. That's 4.50 a week.

41
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,767
And that's a good price.

42
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:02,468
Isn't that a little expensive?

43
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,938
This is a
boardinghouse, not a charity.

44
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:07,040
I need the rent on time.

45
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,948
Good
afternoon, Miss March.

46
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,017
Oh, good afternoon.

47
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,625
You're on fire.

48
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,060
Thank you.

49
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:31,331
You're on fire!

50
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:38,238
- Thank you.
- I have the same habit. You see?

51
00:05:39,571 --> 00:05:41,074
Oh.

52
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:43,043
Kitty and Minnie are waiting.

53
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,279
- Oh, my students need me.
- Always working.

54
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:49,950
Money is the end and aim
of my mercenary existence.

55
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,218
No one gets
ink stains like yours

56
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,054
just out of
a desire for money.

57
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,554
My sister Amy's in Paris,

58
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,924
and until she marries
someone obscenely wealthy,

59
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:00,126
it's up to me
to keep the family afloat.

60
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,527
Goodbye.

61
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:26,152
The Decadents have
ruined Paris, if you ask me.

62
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:28,722
These French women
couldn't lift a hairbrush.

63
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,057
- Amy!
- Hm?

64
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,392
I said, these French women

65
00:06:32,524 --> 00:06:33,793
couldn't lift a hairbrush.

66
00:06:34,995 --> 00:06:36,463
Oh, yes. Very true,
Aunt March.

67
00:06:36,595 --> 00:06:39,032
Oh, don't humor me, girl.

68
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,470
What do they write,
your troublemaking family?

69
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:47,007
Mother doesn't say
anything about Beth.

70
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,275
I feel I should go back.
They all say, "Stay."

71
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,611
You can do nothing
if you go back.

72
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,613
The girl is sick,
not lonely.

73
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,282
And you shouldn't go home
until you and Fred Vaughn

74
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,550
are properly engaged.

75
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:00,220
Yes, and until I've completed

76
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:02,188
all of my painting lessons,
of course.

77
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,859
Oh, yes, yes.

78
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,328
Of course.

79
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,971
- Stop the carriage! Laurie!
- What are you doing?

80
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,173
- Laurie, Laurie, Laurie!
- Amy!

81
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,075
- Laurie! Ha, ha!
- Amy!

82
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,743
Amy!

83
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,078
- How are you?
- Oh!

84
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,578
My, you've grown so much.

85
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,415
You wrote you'd meet me
at the hotel.

86
00:07:28,547 --> 00:07:30,850
- I couldn't find you.
- You didn't look hard enough.

87
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:33,053
I didn't recognize you.
You're so beautiful.

88
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,586
- Oh, stop it.
- I thought you liked that?

89
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:36,423
- Where's your grandfather?
- In Germany.

90
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:38,925
He's still traveling.
I'm on my own now, relaxing.

91
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:42,028
- Flirting, gambling and drinking.
- Yes. Don't tell your mother.

92
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,864
Are you chasing
some young girl across Europe?

93
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,433
No.

94
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:51,271
I couldn't believe Jo
turned you down. I'm so sorry.

95
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:54,541
Don't be, Amy. I... I'm not.

96
00:07:56,176 --> 00:07:57,510
Amy!

97
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:58,845
Amy March!

98
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,780
- Come back this instant!
- Oh, Aunt March.

99
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:03,249
Come. Come on.

100
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:05,251
- Aren't you looking grand?
- Get him off me!

101
00:08:05,385 --> 00:08:06,986
We need to be somewhere.
Off you go!

102
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,621
Come to
the New Year's Eve party.

103
00:08:08,755 --> 00:08:10,557
Everyone will be there,
including Fred.

104
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,759
Pick me up at the hotel
at 8, The Chavain.

105
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:16,096
Oh! And, Laurie,
dress for festivities!

106
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:17,730
Top hats and silks!

107
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,866
I will.
I'll wear my best silk.

108
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,407
It's Laurie.

109
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:30,310
I know.

110
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,488
Twenty yards of blue silk,
as well as pink.

111
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,123
Someone will be by for it later.

112
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:45,458
Oh, Meg, that would
look so lovely on you.

113
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,327
I know the dressmaker
to send you to.

114
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,295
You'll be the prettiest wife
in Concord.

115
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,798
Oh, I... John needs
a new coat for winter,

116
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,533
and Daisy and Demi
need new clothes.

117
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,535
And his wife
needs a new dress.

118
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:58,037
I can't. It's...
I just can't.

119
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:00,440
He'll be so pleased
with how you look,

120
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,509
he'll forget
all about the expense.

121
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,513
I don't suppose it's too much
of an extravagance.

122
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,581
Will 20 yards do?

123
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:11,251
- Yes.
- Very good.

124
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:18,091
Fifty dollars?
What was I thinking?

125
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:27,267
Mommy!

126
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:31,171
Oh, my loves.

127
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,041
Go play.

128
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,839
Beth!

129
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,342
Beth?

130
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,477
There lies your way,
due west.

131
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,379
Then westward ho!

132
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:16,883
Grace and good disposition
attend Your Ladyship.

133
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,586
You'll nothing, madam,
to my lord by me?

134
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:24,224
Stay, I prithee,
tell me what thou thinkest of me.

135
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:27,260
That you do think
you are not what you are.

136
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,529
If I think so,
I think the same of you.

137
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:32,198
Then think you
right, I am not what I am.

138
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:01,794
Like, a big one.
Like, a big one... Like that.

139
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,467
Excuse me?

140
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:10,270
I only speak English.
I'm sorry, what?

141
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:11,804
- What did you say?
- Come dance!

142
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:13,439
Oh!

143
00:12:05,693 --> 00:12:07,695
I know exactly
who I wanna dance with.

144
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:08,861
I'll take this off.

145
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,530
Who will you dance with, Jo?

146
00:12:10,664 --> 00:12:12,098
You know I never dance.

147
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,300
Why can't we all go?
It's not fair.

148
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:17,170
- Wear your regular shoes.
- These fit last winter.

149
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,372
My nose will simply
not look refined.

150
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:20,674
I like your nose.

151
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:22,475
- Now, Jo.
- Don't touch me.

152
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:24,611
I feel ridiculous.
I don't wanna look it.

153
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,212
You could be pretty
if you tried.

154
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,214
- Don't want to. Won't.
- I don't want to go,

155
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:29,882
but I wish
I could hear the music.

156
00:12:30,016 --> 00:12:31,785
I'll keep it in my head
and sing it for you.

157
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,520
- Ought they to smoke like that?
- It's the dampness drying.

158
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:36,657
What a queer smell,
like burnt feathers.

159
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,525
Now I'll take this off and
you'll see a perfect ringlet.

160
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:43,831
Why is her hair off?

161
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:46,232
- Meg, I'm so sorry.
- What have you done?!

162
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:48,568
I'm sorry.

163
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:50,103
You shouldn't have
asked me.

164
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,772
Marmee!

165
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,774
I can't go, I'm spoiled!

166
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,541
My hair!

167
00:12:55,676 --> 00:12:57,877
Don't stare, don't put
your hands behind your back,

168
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,946
don't say "Columbus,"
don't say "capital."

169
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,447
- All right.
- Don't shake hands.

170
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:02,683
Don't whistle.

171
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:05,184
Meg March,
you look so pretty.

172
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,054
Well...

173
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:09,922
Meg.

174
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:26,774
Thank you.

175
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,009
No, it's so early. No.

176
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,678
Fine.

177
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,295
Ooh! Sorry. I didn't know
anyone was here.

178
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,931
- Not at all. Stay if you like.
- I won't disturb you?

179
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:53,933
No. I don't know
many people here.

180
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:55,935
I felt rather strange
at first, you know?

181
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,905
Mm, so do I. Heh.

182
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:00,006
Miss March, isn't it?

183
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,975
Yes, Mr. Laurence, but I'm not
Miss March. I'm only Jo.

184
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:05,111
And I'm not Mr. Laurence,
I'm only Laurie.

185
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:12,018
Don't you dance?

186
00:14:12,151 --> 00:14:13,986
I don't know
how you do things here yet.

187
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,823
I've spent most
of my life in Europe.

188
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,624
Europe! Oh, that's capital!

189
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,993
Shouldn't use
words like that.

190
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:23,996
- Says who?
- Oh, Meg.

191
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,065
She's my older sister. Here.

192
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:30,102
Hm...

193
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,839
Oh, that's her. See?

194
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:36,810
- The girl in the violet dress.
- Mm. It's very pretty.

195
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,512
She reminds me to be good

196
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:42,616
so Father will be proud of me
when he returns.

197
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:44,116
Where is he?

198
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,352
He volunteered
for the Union Army.

199
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,554
And I wanted
to go fight with him.

200
00:14:48,689 --> 00:14:52,191
I can't get over my
disappointment in being a girl.

201
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:54,393
Jo, would you like
to dance with me?

202
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:56,162
I can't because...

203
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:57,631
Because of what?

204
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,502
- You won't tell?
- Never.

205
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:06,172
I scorched my dress.
See? There.

206
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:09,676
And Meg told me to keep still
so no one would see it.

207
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:12,913
You can laugh if you want to.
It's funny, I know.

208
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:16,048
I have an idea
of how we can manage.

209
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:31,197
Oh!

210
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,877
- What?
- My foot.

211
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,311
- I've hurt my ankle.
- Oh!

212
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:19,545
<i>How am I gonna get home?</i>

213
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,948
I don't see what you can do,

214
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,916
except get a carriage
or stay all night.

215
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,117
- Carriages are too expensive.
- Let me take you.

216
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,887
- It's right next door.
- No, thank you.

217
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,790
- We cannot accept.
- You must take mine, please?

218
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:32,458
No. It's so early.
You can't mean to leave yet.

219
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,594
I always leave early.
I do, truly.

220
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:36,697
What choice
do you have, hm?

221
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,567
Goodness gracious.
What have you done?

222
00:16:41,702 --> 00:16:43,637
She's lame and can't walk.
She's hobbling.

223
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:46,539
Clear that chair.
You're supposed to be asleep.

224
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,742
Help your sister,
then back to bed.

225
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,877
Make room.
Meg is a wounded soldier.

226
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:53,647
- I sprained my ankle.
- Oh, Meg, you'll kill yourself

227
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,016
for fashion
one of these days.

228
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:59,452
Here. Hannah, we need ice!

229
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,822
- Oh, come in. Come in.
- Is it all right?

230
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:03,422
Apologies for the chaos.

231
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,491
I enjoy baking
in the middle of the night.

232
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:07,828
Don't mind the clutter,
Mr. Laurence. We don't.

233
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:09,029
Laurie, please.

234
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,530
- Can I call you Teddy?
- Yes.

235
00:17:11,665 --> 00:17:13,767
You must be part
of their theatricals.

236
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,836
- They could use an extra player.
- I'm Amy.

237
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:17,303
- Hello.
- You'll have to fight Jo

238
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,372
for the male roles
or play a girl.

239
00:17:19,505 --> 00:17:21,273
- Have a scone.
- Yes, thank you.

240
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,644
And ice.
Laurie, how are your ankles?

241
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:26,079
- Do you need ice?
- No, thank you, ma'am.

242
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:28,649
Just call me "mother" or Marmee.
Everyone does.

243
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,818
You wore those pink shoes?

244
00:17:31,952 --> 00:17:34,186
Ah, It's cold.

245
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,289
- But they look so good, okay?
- Do you want more ice?

246
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,158
Feels like being
a fine young lady

247
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,128
to come home from a party
in a carriage

248
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,262
and have maids wait on me. Ah!

249
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,500
<i>For the writer in the attic.</i>

250
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,403
Because you enjoyed
the play so much tonight,

251
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,239
I wanted you to have this.

252
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:05,277
It will help you study character
and paint it with your pen.

253
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:07,446
<i>I would love to read
what you're writing,</i>

254
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,415
<i>if you'll trust me.</i>

255
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:14,054
<i>I promise honesty and whatever
intelligence I can muster.</i>

256
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:16,223
Yours, Friedrich.

257
00:19:38,044 --> 00:19:40,479
- Fred, would you like a glass?
- I will. Thank you.

258
00:19:48,155 --> 00:19:49,488
Would you excuse me
a second?

259
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:58,832
Laurie.

260
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:00,133
Amy.

261
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:01,768
I waited an hour for you.

262
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:04,805
I feel caught.

263
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:08,008
Hm.

264
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:11,310
Amy, please. Amy.

265
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:13,280
Do you want to know
what I think of you?

266
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:14,948
- What do you think?
- I despise you.

267
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:16,883
- Why do you despise me?
- With every chance

268
00:20:17,017 --> 00:20:18,517
of being good,
happy and useful,

269
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:20,687
you are lazy, faulty
and miserable.

270
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:22,521
- Ooh, interesting.
- Well, selfish people

271
00:20:22,656 --> 00:20:24,456
- like to talk about themselves.
- Selfish?

272
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,126
- Yes, very selfish.
- Oh.

273
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:28,460
With your money, talent,
beauty, and health...

274
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:29,863
Oh, you think
I'm beautiful.

275
00:20:29,996 --> 00:20:31,698
Yes, you like that,
you old vanity.

276
00:20:31,832 --> 00:20:35,501
With good things to enjoy, you
find nothing to do but dawdle.

277
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:38,972
I'll be good for you, St. Amy.
I'll be good.

278
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:40,974
Aren't you ashamed
of a hand like that?

279
00:20:41,107 --> 00:20:42,809
- I'm not.
- Looks like it's never done

280
00:20:42,943 --> 00:20:45,544
a day of work in its life,
and that ring is ridiculous.

281
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,113
Jo gave me this ring.

282
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:52,152
I feel sorry for you.
I really do.

283
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:53,820
I just wish
you'd bear it better.

284
00:20:53,954 --> 00:20:55,387
You don't have to feel sorry.

285
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:57,824
- You'll feel the same one day.
- No, I'd be respected

286
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,526
if I couldn't be loved.

287
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:04,831
What have you done lately,
oh, great artiste?

288
00:21:04,965 --> 00:21:08,400
Perhaps you're fantasizing about
spending Fred Vaughn's fortune.

289
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:11,004
Fred Vaughn,
ladies and gentlemen!

290
00:21:19,246 --> 00:21:20,881
Fred, I...

291
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:22,182
I'm so sorry.

292
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:40,000
Those are just stories,
of course.

293
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:46,039
But I'm working on a novel.

294
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:48,942
And your novel...

295
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:50,409
it will be like this?

296
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:53,613
Yes. So far, anyway.

297
00:21:53,747 --> 00:21:55,348
With plots like this?

298
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:00,754
- Duels and killing and...
- It sells, so...

299
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:02,622
Why don't you sign
your real name?

300
00:22:02,756 --> 00:22:04,490
Oh, my mother
wouldn't like it.

301
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,460
It's too gory for her.

302
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:11,463
I wanna help with the money
I make and not worry her.

303
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:18,338
Mm.

304
00:22:22,075 --> 00:22:24,344
You know, I...
I don't like them.

305
00:22:26,746 --> 00:22:28,348
Honestly, uh...

306
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,085
I mean, I... I think
that they're not good.

307
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:39,491
Uh, but...

308
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:41,828
They're...

309
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,597
They're published
in the papers,

310
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:48,835
and people have always said
that I'm talented.

311
00:22:48,969 --> 00:22:51,171
Oh, I think you're talented.

312
00:22:51,304 --> 00:22:54,074
Which is why I'm being so...
So blunt.

313
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:59,679
Well, I can't afford
to starve on praise.

314
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:01,815
Are you upset?

315
00:23:01,948 --> 00:23:03,750
Of course I'm upset.
You just...

316
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,484
You told me
you didn't like my work.

317
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:07,153
Jo, I thought
you wanted honesty.

318
00:23:07,287 --> 00:23:10,290
I... Yes, I do.

319
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:14,160
Has no one ever talked
to you like this before?

320
00:23:14,294 --> 00:23:16,129
Yes, I've been rejected
plenty of times.

321
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:19,065
Do you have anyone
to take you seriously, Jo,

322
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:21,701
- to talk about your work?
- And who made you high priest

323
00:23:21,835 --> 00:23:23,336
of what's good
and what's bad?

324
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:26,172
- No one, and I'm not...
- Then why are you acting like it?

325
00:23:26,306 --> 00:23:28,408
Your reaction indicates
there is some truth...

326
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,543
My reaction indicates
that you are a pompous blowhard.

327
00:23:31,678 --> 00:23:33,213
Shakespeare wrote
for the masses.

328
00:23:33,346 --> 00:23:35,581
Shakespeare was the greatest
poet who ever lived

329
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:37,984
because he smuggled his poetry
in popular works.

330
00:23:38,118 --> 00:23:40,220
- I'm no Shakespeare.
- Thank goodness.

331
00:23:40,353 --> 00:23:41,688
We already have him.

332
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:43,156
If you know so much about it,

333
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:44,958
why don't you just
do it yourself?

334
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:47,360
Because I'm not a writer.

335
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:50,363
- I don't have the gifts you have.
- No, you don't.

336
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:53,133
You will always be a critic
and never an author.

337
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:56,002
And the world will forget
that you ever even lived.

338
00:23:56,136 --> 00:23:58,537
- Oh, I'm sure they will.
- But...

339
00:23:58,671 --> 00:23:59,806
I... But I...

340
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,044
No one will forget Jo March.

341
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:09,749
I can believe it.

342
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:10,917
Listen.

343
00:24:11,051 --> 00:24:12,252
We are not friends.

344
00:24:12,385 --> 00:24:14,788
You are not my friend.

345
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:16,923
And I don't want your opinion

346
00:24:17,057 --> 00:24:18,725
because I don't
like you very much.

347
00:24:18,858 --> 00:24:21,027
So just don't talk
to me anymore. Thank you.

348
00:24:41,081 --> 00:24:43,716
Oh, Josephine,
this came for you.

349
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,251
Oh, thank you.

350
00:24:54,194 --> 00:24:55,862
Beth.

351
00:25:38,606 --> 00:25:40,874
Merry Christmas, world.

352
00:25:45,945 --> 00:25:47,514
Merry Christmas!

353
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:50,250
- Merry Christmas.
- Give me another orange.

354
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:52,819
- Jo, we've been up for hours.
- What have you been writing?

355
00:25:52,952 --> 00:25:55,021
Oh, I got carried away
with our revenge play

356
00:25:55,155 --> 00:25:56,122
last night, <i>Poison.</i>

357
00:25:56,256 --> 00:25:57,991
No, no poison.
It's Christmas.

358
00:25:58,124 --> 00:25:59,959
Won't be Christmas
without any presents.

359
00:26:00,093 --> 00:26:02,195
- It's dreadful being poor.
- It's not fair.

360
00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:04,097
How come some girls
have pretty things

361
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,365
and others have nothing?

362
00:26:05,498 --> 00:26:07,267
We have Father, Mother
and each other.

363
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,936
We haven't got Father as
long as this war drags on.

364
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,005
I wish I had money
and plenty of servants,

365
00:26:12,138 --> 00:26:13,206
so I never had to work.

366
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:15,241
Or you could be
a proper actress.

367
00:26:15,375 --> 00:26:16,709
They aren't all fallen women.

368
00:26:16,843 --> 00:26:18,978
- I can't be an actress.
- I have lots of wishes,

369
00:26:19,112 --> 00:26:21,314
but my favorite one
is to be an artist in Paris

370
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:24,184
and do fine pictures and be
the best painter in the world.

371
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:26,553
That's what you want, Jo,
to be a famous writer?

372
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:28,656
Yes, but it sounds crass
when she says it.

373
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:30,023
- Why be ashamed?
- I'm not.

374
00:26:30,156 --> 00:26:31,257
My wish is to have us

375
00:26:31,391 --> 00:26:33,259
all be together
with Father and Mother.

376
00:26:33,393 --> 00:26:35,595
- That's what I want.
- Beth is perfect.

377
00:26:35,728 --> 00:26:37,665
- Amy.
- What about your music, huh?

378
00:26:37,797 --> 00:26:39,933
I do that for us. I don't need
anyone else to hear it.

379
00:26:40,066 --> 00:26:41,534
You must not limit yourself.

380
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:43,736
Mother proposed not having
presents this year

381
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:45,673
because men are suffering
in the Army.

382
00:26:45,805 --> 00:26:47,307
We can't do much,
but we can make

383
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,209
our little sacrifices
and do it gladly.

384
00:26:49,342 --> 00:26:52,011
Don't play mother
just because she's not home.

385
00:26:52,145 --> 00:26:54,814
- Jo, that's so boyish.
- That's why I do it.

386
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:58,351
- I detest rude, unladylike girls.
- I hate affected little chits.

387
00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:00,987
- Jo!
- My nose! My nose! Ow!

388
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,089
It's already no good!

389
00:27:03,223 --> 00:27:04,424
Jo! Jo!

390
00:27:04,557 --> 00:27:06,159
I know you don't care
what I think,

391
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:08,696
but you don't want your mother
to find you like this, do you?

392
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:10,096
We care what you think.

393
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,098
You're more family
than old Aunt March.

394
00:27:12,232 --> 00:27:14,167
- Don't, Jo.
- Where is Marmee? I'm starving.

395
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,136
Goodness only knows. Some
poor creature came a-begging.

396
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:19,572
Your ma set straight off
to see what was needed.

397
00:27:19,707 --> 00:27:22,308
I wish she could help others
at a time convenient to us.

398
00:27:22,442 --> 00:27:24,310
Joanna and I
are very hungry.

399
00:27:24,444 --> 00:27:26,779
- Dolls don't get hungry.
- I've rewritten the climax.

400
00:27:26,913 --> 00:27:29,282
We need to set it to memory.
Amy, get the costumes.

401
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:31,384
I have made
the most divine crown,

402
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:34,454
and I painted my old shoes blue,
so she looks like a princess!

403
00:27:34,587 --> 00:27:36,589
The melancholy piece
is pretty good.

404
00:27:36,724 --> 00:27:38,324
Wait until
you see this new speech.

405
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:40,661
I don't see how you
write such splendid things.

406
00:27:40,793 --> 00:27:42,663
- You're a regular Shakespeare.
- Not quite.

407
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:45,598
Miss Michelangelo, can you
rehearse the fainting scene?

408
00:27:45,733 --> 00:27:47,767
- You're as stiff as a poker.
- I can't help it.

409
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,737
I never saw anyone faint.
I don't intend

410
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:51,571
to make myself
all black and blue.

411
00:27:51,705 --> 00:27:53,406
If I can fall down easily,
I'll drop.

412
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:55,942
If I cannot, I shall fall
gracefully into a chair.

413
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:58,746
And I don't care if Hugo
comes at me with a pistol.

414
00:27:58,878 --> 00:28:00,213
- Hannah?
- I'm not acting.

415
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:01,814
I didn't even say anything.

416
00:28:01,948 --> 00:28:04,284
I knew what you were going
to say. I'm not acting.

417
00:28:13,761 --> 00:28:17,263
I need both of you
to kneel right there.

418
00:28:17,397 --> 00:28:19,332
- I need you to kneel.
- I don't want to.

419
00:28:19,465 --> 00:28:21,501
This is supposed to be
our special scene.

420
00:28:21,635 --> 00:28:23,637
- No one's gonna be looking at us.
- Smile.

421
00:28:23,771 --> 00:28:25,305
- I don't want to.
- You have to.

422
00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:27,040
I think Meg should be
the director.

423
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:29,175
So I think that
she'll need to kneel...

424
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:31,779
- But it's our scene.
- If you'll kneel and look...

425
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:33,313
Merry Christmas, girls.

426
00:28:33,446 --> 00:28:35,481
- Marmee!
- Oh, merry Christmas!

427
00:28:35,616 --> 00:28:39,118
I'm so glad to see you so happy.
How's your play?

428
00:28:39,252 --> 00:28:42,055
Jo, you look tired. Were you up
again all night writing?

429
00:28:42,188 --> 00:28:45,391
- Of course.
- Amy, come kiss me. Thank you.

430
00:28:45,525 --> 00:28:47,060
Merry Christmas.
How are my girls?

431
00:28:47,193 --> 00:28:48,762
- I'm so hungry.
- Look at this.

432
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:51,497
- I could eat a horse.
- Don't say that, Jo.

433
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:54,702
What?

434
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:57,937
What is it?

435
00:28:58,071 --> 00:29:00,940
Not far from here lives
a poor young woman, Mrs. Hummel.

436
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:03,876
Her five children are in one bed
to keep from freezing,

437
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:05,845
and there's nothing to eat.

438
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:07,681
Will you give them
your breakfast

439
00:29:07,815 --> 00:29:09,515
as a Christmas present?

440
00:29:14,354 --> 00:29:17,624
Is this where you say
that Father would want us to?

441
00:29:17,758 --> 00:29:19,058
Yes.

442
00:29:29,703 --> 00:29:31,237
Thank you.

443
00:29:31,371 --> 00:29:34,742
And thank you, Mr. Laurence,
for including me.

444
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:35,908
You're welcome.

445
00:29:40,546 --> 00:29:43,717
Perhaps you could tutor
my grandson in manners,

446
00:29:43,851 --> 00:29:45,786
as well as mathematics,
huh?

447
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,862
Oh, girls...

448
00:29:57,363 --> 00:29:58,832
Be careful.

449
00:30:01,802 --> 00:30:03,771
Watch yourselves.

450
00:30:03,903 --> 00:30:05,905
Out here with no sleeves.

451
00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:23,089
It is good angels come to us.

452
00:30:25,626 --> 00:30:30,229
Hello. I'm back.
And have food and blankets.

453
00:30:30,363 --> 00:30:31,665
And sweaters.

454
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:33,499
And we brought some medicine.

455
00:30:33,634 --> 00:30:35,334
So these are my girls.

456
00:30:35,468 --> 00:30:36,502
Say hello.

457
00:30:36,637 --> 00:30:38,639
He is not well.

458
00:30:38,772 --> 00:30:41,140
Girls, why don't you
unpack the food?

459
00:30:41,274 --> 00:30:42,843
Would you like some?

460
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:48,414
You want one?

461
00:30:48,548 --> 00:30:50,651
- Yeah, have it all.
- Why don't we get some firewood?

462
00:30:50,784 --> 00:30:52,018
It's good, isn't it?

463
00:30:55,722 --> 00:30:57,156
That's nice, huh?

464
00:31:02,796 --> 00:31:05,998
Marmee, we don't need our toes.
I think I've lost one.

465
00:31:06,132 --> 00:31:08,234
Has anyone else
lost their toe?

466
00:31:09,969 --> 00:31:11,905
- That was amazing.
- I can't feel my feet.

467
00:31:14,974 --> 00:31:18,110
- Is it fairies?
- Santa Claus.

468
00:31:18,244 --> 00:31:20,681
- It's Aunt March.
- Mr. Laurence sent it.

469
00:31:20,814 --> 00:31:23,082
- The Laurence boy's grandfather?
- Yes.

470
00:31:23,216 --> 00:31:24,450
- Why?
- He saw you

471
00:31:24,584 --> 00:31:26,285
giving your
Christmas breakfast away.

472
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:27,788
He wanted you
to enjoy the day.

473
00:31:27,921 --> 00:31:29,656
I thought he was a mean old man.

474
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,824
It's so generous.

475
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:32,024
His grandson, Laurie,

476
00:31:32,158 --> 00:31:33,493
put the idea into his head.

477
00:31:33,627 --> 00:31:36,028
I know he did.
We should make friends with him.

478
00:31:36,162 --> 00:31:39,365
Boys scare me, and that
big old house scares me.

479
00:31:39,499 --> 00:31:41,702
Jenny Snow says
Mr. Laurence disowned his son

480
00:31:41,835 --> 00:31:43,670
after he went off
with an Italian woman.

481
00:31:43,804 --> 00:31:45,404
Now his grandson
is an orphan

482
00:31:45,538 --> 00:31:48,341
and spends his time in that
house locked up with his tutor.

483
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:50,677
He's a very kind man
who lost his little girl

484
00:31:50,811 --> 00:31:53,246
when she was only a child.
Now his son as well.

485
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:55,081
- His daughter died?
- So sad.

486
00:31:55,214 --> 00:31:56,817
Doesn't Laurie
seem so romantic?

487
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,719
- He's half Italian.
- What do you know?

488
00:31:58,852 --> 00:32:00,319
You've barely spoken
to him. Ow!

489
00:32:00,453 --> 00:32:02,321
I'm not responsible
for this feast,

490
00:32:02,455 --> 00:32:03,624
but I have got a surprise.

491
00:32:04,825 --> 00:32:06,526
A letter from Father!

492
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,227
Don't I wish I could go?

493
00:32:08,361 --> 00:32:10,396
Jo, we can't give up
our only brother.

494
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,666
It must be so disagreeable
to sleep in a tent.

495
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,902
Jo sits in back,
so we can't see her cry. Ow!

496
00:32:15,034 --> 00:32:16,737
- What if I do?
- Will he be coming home?

497
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:19,171
He'll stay and work faithfully
as long as he can.

498
00:32:19,305 --> 00:32:20,807
We won't ask
for him to come back

499
00:32:20,941 --> 00:32:22,843
a minute sooner
than he can be spared.

500
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,847
"Give them all
my dear love and a kiss.

501
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,851
"Tell them I think of them
by day, pray for them by night

502
00:32:30,984 --> 00:32:34,021
"and find my best comforts
in their affection at all times.

503
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:37,858
"A year seems a very long time
to wait before I see them.

504
00:32:37,991 --> 00:32:39,927
"But remind them
that while we wait,

505
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:42,896
"we may all work,
so these hard days...

506
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:45,531
"need not be wasted.

507
00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:48,367
<i>"I know that they will
be loving children to you.</i>

508
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,470
<i>"Do their duty faithfully.</i>

509
00:32:52,739 --> 00:32:54,473
<i>"Fight their enemies bravely.</i>

510
00:32:56,409 --> 00:32:59,046
<i>And conquer themselves
so beautifully."</i>

511
00:32:59,178 --> 00:33:02,049
<i>The Witch's Curse,</i>
a play by Jo March.

512
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:06,352
Make it sweet
and swift and strong...

513
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,354
<i>"That when I
come back to them..."</i>

514
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,356
Spirit, answer now my song.

515
00:33:10,489 --> 00:33:12,859
<i>"...I may be...</i>

516
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:15,394
<i>fonder and prouder
than ever..."</i>

517
00:33:17,363 --> 00:33:18,865
<i>"of my little women."</i>

518
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:21,868
Brava!

519
00:33:25,438 --> 00:33:27,941
Excuse me. Excuse me.

520
00:33:28,075 --> 00:33:30,744
Excuse me.
Your stop, ma'am.

521
00:33:30,877 --> 00:33:32,913
Oh, thank you.

522
00:33:33,046 --> 00:33:34,948
<i>She's gone? Why?</i>

523
00:33:35,082 --> 00:33:37,316
I don't know. She just left.

524
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,185
She didn't say
if she was coming back?

525
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:41,320
We didn't have
a heart-to-heart, professor.

526
00:33:41,454 --> 00:33:44,858
Why are you just sitting there?
Please, go, go. Dust something.

527
00:33:44,992 --> 00:33:46,158
And what about the girls?

528
00:33:46,292 --> 00:33:48,095
She was the best teacher
they ever had.

529
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:49,328
I know.

530
00:34:00,907 --> 00:34:04,111
<i>It is so hard to go back
to work after such good times.</i>

531
00:34:04,243 --> 00:34:05,779
I wish it was Christmas
every day.

532
00:34:05,912 --> 00:34:07,781
Or New Year's.
Wouldn't that be exciting?

533
00:34:07,914 --> 00:34:09,582
We are a bunch
of ungrateful minxes.

534
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:11,183
Don't say
such despicable things.

535
00:34:11,317 --> 00:34:13,319
I like strong words
that mean something.

536
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:15,689
I have to go back,
and I don't have any limes.

537
00:34:15,822 --> 00:34:17,924
- Limes?
- Girls are trading pickled limes,

538
00:34:18,058 --> 00:34:20,359
and I'm in debt.
I owe ever so many limes.

539
00:34:20,493 --> 00:34:22,194
- Will this do?
- What'd you do that for?

540
00:34:22,328 --> 00:34:24,163
- Meg, thank you.
- I know what it is

541
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:26,499
to want things
and feel less than other girls.

542
00:34:26,633 --> 00:34:28,669
That and the drawings
will wipe out my debt.

543
00:34:28,802 --> 00:34:29,803
- What drawings?
- Nothing.

544
00:34:29,936 --> 00:34:31,337
I'm glad Mother
doesn't make me

545
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,839
go to school
with those girls.

546
00:34:32,973 --> 00:34:34,074
Hurry. I'll be late.

547
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:35,742
Beth, after shopping,
I need you

548
00:34:35,876 --> 00:34:37,844
to work through
the new sums and spelling.

549
00:34:37,978 --> 00:34:40,147
- I'll check it when I get home.
- Oh, fine.

550
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:41,180
Bye.

551
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:02,368
Ooh!

552
00:35:02,501 --> 00:35:04,971
- Josephine.
- Yes?

553
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:08,340
- Oh! Josephine.
- Yes? Here.

554
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:11,645
Is there a reason
you stopped reading Belsham?

555
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:13,914
I'm sorry.
I'll continue.

556
00:35:15,649 --> 00:35:18,217
You mind yourself, deary.
Someday you'll need me

557
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,654
and you'll wish
you had behaved better.

558
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:22,756
Thank you, Aunt March,
for your employment

559
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:24,157
and your many kindnesses,

560
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:26,392
but I intend to make
my own way in the world.

561
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:28,028
Oh, well.

562
00:35:28,161 --> 00:35:30,664
No. No one makes
their own way.

563
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:32,231
Not really.

564
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:35,468
Least of all, a woman.
You'll need to marry well.

565
00:35:35,602 --> 00:35:38,370
- But you are not married.
- That's because I'm rich.

566
00:35:38,504 --> 00:35:40,707
And I made sure
to keep hold of my money.

567
00:35:40,841 --> 00:35:43,210
Unlike your father.

568
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:46,245
So the only way to be an
unmarried woman is to be rich?

569
00:35:46,378 --> 00:35:48,380
- Yes.
- There are precious few ways

570
00:35:48,514 --> 00:35:50,917
- for women to make money.
- That's not true.

571
00:35:51,051 --> 00:35:52,786
You could run a cathouse.

572
00:35:52,919 --> 00:35:54,988
Or go on the stage.

573
00:35:55,122 --> 00:35:57,224
Practically the same thing.

574
00:35:57,356 --> 00:35:59,391
Other than that,
you're right.

575
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:01,594
Precious few ways
for women.

576
00:36:01,728 --> 00:36:04,898
- That's why you should heed me.
- So I can get married.

577
00:36:05,031 --> 00:36:09,368
No. So you can live a better
life than your poor mother has.

578
00:36:09,502 --> 00:36:14,473
- But Marmee loves her life.
- You don't know what she loves.

579
00:36:14,608 --> 00:36:17,376
Your father cared more about
educating freedmen's children

580
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,545
than he did about caring
for his own family.

581
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:21,081
Yes, but he was right.

582
00:36:21,214 --> 00:36:24,450
Well, it's possible
to be right and foolish.

583
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:25,919
Well, I don't think so.

584
00:36:26,052 --> 00:36:28,387
Well, you're not paid
to think.

585
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:36,696
I know you don't care much
about marriage now.

586
00:36:38,799 --> 00:36:40,366
Can't say I blame you.

587
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:45,272
But I intend to go
to Europe one more time

588
00:36:45,404 --> 00:36:48,541
and I need a companion,

589
00:36:48,675 --> 00:36:50,844
so how would you like to be
the person I take?

590
00:36:50,977 --> 00:36:53,046
I'd like that
more than anything.

591
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,282
All right, then read.

592
00:36:55,414 --> 00:36:57,884
And don't sneak around.

593
00:36:58,018 --> 00:36:59,820
I don't like sneaks.

594
00:37:02,555 --> 00:37:03,556
<i>President Lincoln.</i>

595
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,192
No, Father's fighting for him.

596
00:37:05,324 --> 00:37:06,993
My father says
the war is a waste

597
00:37:07,127 --> 00:37:09,029
and we should let
them keep their labor.

598
00:37:09,162 --> 00:37:10,429
Susan, it is immoral.

599
00:37:10,563 --> 00:37:12,132
Everyone benefited
from the system,

600
00:37:12,265 --> 00:37:13,432
including you Marches.

601
00:37:13,566 --> 00:37:15,302
Why should only
the South be punished?

602
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:16,870
Maybe we should
all be punished.

603
00:37:17,003 --> 00:37:18,437
The Marches
love a cause.

604
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:20,539
Fine. Just do Mr. Davis.

605
00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:24,878
- I don't know if I should.
- I'll wipe out your debt

606
00:37:25,011 --> 00:37:27,214
and give you
five more limes besides.

607
00:37:27,346 --> 00:37:30,516
...your spelling and, moreover,
your reading habit.

608
00:37:44,698 --> 00:37:45,999
Miss March.

609
00:37:49,002 --> 00:37:49,936
<i>Sit down.</i>

610
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,707
Sit down, Laurie.

611
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,507
Latin is a privilege.

612
00:37:55,642 --> 00:37:57,244
Please,
you have to learn this.

613
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,079
I can't afford
to lose this position.

614
00:37:59,212 --> 00:38:01,447
- Return to the Cicero...
- There's a girl out there.

615
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,117
- No, there is not.
- Yes, Mr. Brooke, there's a girl.

616
00:38:04,251 --> 00:38:06,119
No, there is not.

617
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:13,226
I'll never get
to go home again.

618
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,762
- Oh, there is a girl.
- That's a girl.

619
00:38:17,563 --> 00:38:19,398
Hello there. Are you hurt?

620
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:22,235
- I'm Amy.
- Hello, Amy. I'm Laurie.

621
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:24,871
I know. You brought my sister
back after the dance.

622
00:38:25,005 --> 00:38:27,040
I would've never
have sprained my ankle.

623
00:38:27,173 --> 00:38:29,910
I have lovely small feet,
the best in the family.

624
00:38:30,043 --> 00:38:34,580
But I can never go home again
because I'm in such trouble.

625
00:38:34,714 --> 00:38:36,383
Look.

626
00:38:36,515 --> 00:38:38,919
Mr. Davis hit me.

627
00:38:41,755 --> 00:38:45,392
Tell the servants I want this
painting purchased immediately!

628
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:47,994
- Amy! Are you in here?
- Meg! My hand. Look.

629
00:38:48,128 --> 00:38:49,595
- Jo.
- What richness.

630
00:38:49,729 --> 00:38:51,497
- It hurts so much.
- You ought to be

631
00:38:51,631 --> 00:38:52,999
the happiest boy in the world.

632
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:54,768
A fellow can't live
on books alone.

633
00:38:54,901 --> 00:38:56,435
- I could. What did you do?
- Nothing.

634
00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:58,570
I did a drawing,
and then Mr. Davis hit me.

635
00:38:58,705 --> 00:39:00,907
Oh, Christopher Columbus,
look at that.

636
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:03,276
That's my grandfather.
Are you scared of him?

637
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,312
I'm not scared of anyone.
He looks stern,

638
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:07,247
but my grandfather
was more handsome.

639
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,115
Jo, we do not
compare grandfathers.

640
00:39:09,249 --> 00:39:10,784
You think
he's more handsome, eh?

641
00:39:10,917 --> 00:39:14,154
Oh... No, actually,
you are very handsome.

642
00:39:14,287 --> 00:39:16,957
- I didn't mean...
- I knew your mother's father.

643
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:19,059
You've got his spirit.

644
00:39:19,192 --> 00:39:21,227
Oh, well, thank you, sir.

645
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,597
You are not to attend
that school anymore.

646
00:39:25,732 --> 00:39:27,599
Good. That man
has always been an idiot.

647
00:39:27,734 --> 00:39:30,236
- Jo will teach you.
- Me? I already teach Beth.

648
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,939
- You're a good teacher.
- Yes, women being taught at home

649
00:39:33,073 --> 00:39:34,407
is more proper, I believe.

650
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,475
Only because schools
for women are poor.

651
00:39:36,609 --> 00:39:38,111
Indeed. Quite right.

652
00:39:38,244 --> 00:39:39,746
I wish all the girls
would leave

653
00:39:39,879 --> 00:39:41,781
- and he would die.
- You did wrong.

654
00:39:41,915 --> 00:39:44,718
- There will be consequences.
- I didn't even do anything.

655
00:39:44,851 --> 00:39:46,653
- I just did a drawing.
- Thank you so much

656
00:39:46,786 --> 00:39:49,022
- for taking care of Amy.
- Oh, yes, of course.

657
00:39:49,155 --> 00:39:51,458
My girls have a way
of getting into mischief.

658
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,059
Well, so do I.

659
00:39:53,193 --> 00:39:55,494
Then you'll run over
and we'll take care of you.

660
00:39:55,628 --> 00:39:57,998
Come over whenever you'd like.
Invite Beth as well.

661
00:39:58,131 --> 00:40:01,334
- Yes! Beth would adore the piano.
- Is she the quiet one?

662
00:40:01,468 --> 00:40:02,736
Yes, that's our Beth.

663
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:05,405
Tell that little girl
to use our piano.

664
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:07,207
Jo, borrow whatever book
you'd like.

665
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,142
- Can I come look at paintings?
- Yes.

666
00:40:09,275 --> 00:40:11,144
There's also
a lovely greenhouse.

667
00:40:12,212 --> 00:40:13,813
We must go. Girls.

668
00:40:13,947 --> 00:40:17,117
- Can you buy this painting?
- I'm going to take this one.

669
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,052
- If that's okay.
- I'll bring it back soon.

670
00:40:19,185 --> 00:40:20,620
Thank you again.

671
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:22,022
Thank you for my hand!

672
00:40:22,155 --> 00:40:23,656
- Thank you!
- Goodbye.

673
00:40:27,327 --> 00:40:29,129
Oh, uh, Miss Meg?

674
00:40:29,262 --> 00:40:30,830
You forgot your glove.

675
00:40:38,772 --> 00:40:41,741
Well, back to work.

676
00:40:41,875 --> 00:40:43,009
Back to work.

677
00:40:59,059 --> 00:41:03,430
Order! Order.
Order. Order!

678
00:41:03,562 --> 00:41:06,900
A new play written
by Miss Jo March

679
00:41:07,033 --> 00:41:08,701
will appear
at the Barnville Theater

680
00:41:08,835 --> 00:41:11,771
in the course of the next
few weeks that will surpass

681
00:41:11,905 --> 00:41:15,742
anything ever seen before
on the American stage.

682
00:41:15,875 --> 00:41:17,610
Starring
the greatest actress

683
00:41:17,744 --> 00:41:20,547
from here to the Mississippi
River, Miss Meg March.

684
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,616
- Yes. There we go. Very good.
- Excellent. Bravo, bravo.

685
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:27,353
- Weekly report. Meg good, Jo bad.
- Mm-hm.

686
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:30,690
Beth very good.
And Amy sort of middling.

687
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:32,859
- Very well done, sirs.
- Excellent.

688
00:41:32,992 --> 00:41:35,028
- Excellent, excellent.
- Bravo.

689
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:36,930
Mr. President and gentlemen,

690
00:41:37,063 --> 00:41:39,966
I wish to propose the admission
of a new member.

691
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,436
One who would be
deeply, deeply grateful

692
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:48,441
and would add immensely
to the spirit of the club.

693
00:41:48,575 --> 00:41:50,110
I propose...

694
00:41:51,444 --> 00:41:55,248
Mr. Theodore Laurence!

695
00:41:55,381 --> 00:41:56,783
- Absolutely not.
- No.

696
00:41:56,916 --> 00:41:59,919
- What? Come, now. Let's have him.
- He's a real boy.

697
00:42:00,053 --> 00:42:01,354
We don't want any boys.

698
00:42:01,488 --> 00:42:02,956
- This is a club for ladies.
- Yes.

699
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:04,390
- I think we should do it.
- Why?

700
00:42:04,524 --> 00:42:06,359
- Even if we're afraid, I say yes.
- Why?

701
00:42:06,493 --> 00:42:07,927
- It's Laurie.
- What? No.

702
00:42:08,061 --> 00:42:10,363
- It'll change everything.
- All right, I call a vote.

703
00:42:10,497 --> 00:42:12,699
- Put your hands up.
- Don't put your hand up.

704
00:42:12,832 --> 00:42:14,367
Put your hand up. It's Laurie.

705
00:42:14,501 --> 00:42:15,635
Fine. Aye.

706
00:42:15,768 --> 00:42:17,370
There is no time
like the present...

707
00:42:19,139 --> 00:42:21,441
Ladies, ladies, please, please.

708
00:42:21,574 --> 00:42:24,110
This is my stratagem.
I deserve the blame.

709
00:42:24,244 --> 00:42:26,646
Jo only gave in to it
after lots of teasing.

710
00:42:26,779 --> 00:42:28,815
Yes. I merely wish to say

711
00:42:28,948 --> 00:42:32,018
as a slight token
of my gratitude that I...

712
00:42:34,454 --> 00:42:35,455
- Yes, yes.
- Go on.

713
00:42:35,588 --> 00:42:37,190
As a means of promoting

714
00:42:37,323 --> 00:42:40,160
friendly relations
between adjoining nations.

715
00:42:40,293 --> 00:42:43,196
And thus, I propose
this set of keys

716
00:42:43,329 --> 00:42:48,001
for a little post office I've
made in the forest by the pond.

717
00:42:48,134 --> 00:42:50,904
Yes, four keys.
They're for you, darling.

718
00:42:51,037 --> 00:42:55,008
- Meg, yes, yes. And for you.
- Oh, thank you very much.

719
00:42:55,141 --> 00:42:58,077
This is for me. Without further
ado, thank you for your favor.

720
00:42:58,211 --> 00:43:00,046
I will take my seat
as part of the club.

721
00:43:02,215 --> 00:43:05,985
- Yes, well. Of course. Yes, yes.
- Bravo, bravo.

722
00:43:08,388 --> 00:43:10,156
Welcome, Laurie.

723
00:43:23,036 --> 00:43:25,905
- Three, four, five.
- You both got five.

724
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:28,241
- I asked the doctor.
- That's a draw, I think.

725
00:43:28,374 --> 00:43:31,144
- It doesn't make sense.
- I can't believe it.

726
00:43:31,277 --> 00:43:32,545
Hello.

727
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,013
Jo!

728
00:43:39,118 --> 00:43:41,421
Daisy and Demi!
Can I have a hug?

729
00:43:41,554 --> 00:43:43,323
Oh, you've gotten so big.

730
00:43:44,857 --> 00:43:46,426
I wish you were here
to teach them.

731
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,827
I know. Well, I'm here now.

732
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:50,096
- So good to have you home.
- Take this off.

733
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:52,198
I think the
loneliness got to Beth,

734
00:43:52,332 --> 00:43:53,967
though she ain't
said anything.

735
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:58,606
- Where is Beth?
- She's upstairs. Oh, my Jo.

736
00:43:58,738 --> 00:44:02,575
We thought she was better, but
the fever'd weakened her heart.

737
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:05,945
Take this and find her
the best doctor you can.

738
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:07,648
You need this
to live in New York.

739
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:09,749
No, I'm not going back.
I'm using the rest

740
00:44:09,882 --> 00:44:11,951
to take her to the sea
and get her strong.

741
00:44:15,021 --> 00:44:17,357
When's Amy coming home?

742
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:20,628
- We didn't want to worry her.
- Does she not know?

743
00:44:23,029 --> 00:44:24,931
Beth insisted
we not tell her

744
00:44:25,064 --> 00:44:27,867
because she didn't want
to ruin Amy's trip.

745
00:44:31,404 --> 00:44:32,640
Amy has always had a talent

746
00:44:32,772 --> 00:44:34,742
for getting out
of the hard parts of life.

747
00:44:34,874 --> 00:44:37,543
Jo, don't be angry
with your sister.

748
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:47,755
I can't seem to find anything.

749
00:44:47,887 --> 00:44:49,657
Marmee, have you seen my glove?

750
00:44:49,789 --> 00:44:51,625
When did you last see it?

751
00:44:53,293 --> 00:44:56,162
Jo! Jo, where are you?

752
00:44:56,296 --> 00:44:58,364
- I can't find my other glove.
- Take mine.

753
00:44:58,498 --> 00:45:00,601
- We're going to be late.
- Where are you going?

754
00:45:00,734 --> 00:45:02,135
You're not invited.

755
00:45:02,268 --> 00:45:04,037
You're going
somewhere with Laurie.

756
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:06,339
- I know it.
- Yes, we are. Now stop bothering.

757
00:45:06,472 --> 00:45:08,207
- You have the tickets?
- Yes. Hurry.

758
00:45:08,341 --> 00:45:11,477
- You're going to the theater.
- Meg, please, can I come?

759
00:45:11,612 --> 00:45:13,513
- Sorry, you weren't invited.
- You can't go.

760
00:45:13,647 --> 00:45:15,448
Don't be a baby
and whine about it.

761
00:45:15,581 --> 00:45:17,950
I've been shut up here.
I never get to go anywhere.

762
00:45:18,084 --> 00:45:21,554
- Beth has her piano. I'm lonely.
- I can teach you chords.

763
00:45:21,689 --> 00:45:24,023
I don't want chords.
I want to go to the theater.

764
00:45:24,157 --> 00:45:26,660
I think you'd hate to poke in
where you're not wanted.

765
00:45:26,794 --> 00:45:28,928
We already have to deal
with dull Mr. Brooke.

766
00:45:29,062 --> 00:45:31,464
- I like him. He's kind.
- But I can pay for myself.

767
00:45:31,597 --> 00:45:32,965
You will not come.

768
00:45:33,099 --> 00:45:34,802
I'm sorry, my sweet,
but Jo is right.

769
00:45:34,934 --> 00:45:36,369
- No! Please.
- Next time.

770
00:45:36,502 --> 00:45:39,138
- Come, Meg. Stop petting her.
- Please, please, please!

771
00:45:39,272 --> 00:45:41,507
Ugh, you'll be sorry
for this, Jo March!

772
00:45:41,642 --> 00:45:44,510
- Amy!
- You will! You'll regret this!

773
00:45:47,513 --> 00:45:50,016
Stop looking at me like that!

774
00:46:37,731 --> 00:46:39,332
Oh, um...

775
00:46:43,704 --> 00:46:45,706
- I loved every second of it.
- Ow! Jo!

776
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:49,942
- I thought the actress was... Oh!
- She was very, very good.

777
00:46:50,076 --> 00:46:53,546
- Yes, she was really good.
- She was. She was very good.

778
00:47:09,529 --> 00:47:10,963
Bye!

779
00:47:11,097 --> 00:47:13,132
Oh, I love the theater.

780
00:47:13,266 --> 00:47:15,669
Meg, you're a million times
better than she was.

781
00:47:15,803 --> 00:47:17,503
Although she was
a terrific fainter.

782
00:47:17,638 --> 00:47:19,740
I wonder how she managed
to turn so white.

783
00:47:19,873 --> 00:47:22,308
That Mr. Brooke,
could he be any more obsequious?

784
00:47:22,442 --> 00:47:24,110
I thought he was
very well-mannered.

785
00:47:24,243 --> 00:47:26,647
Hold on. Let me
just get this idea down.

786
00:47:32,585 --> 00:47:34,287
Beth, what's your
favorite eye color?

787
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,589
- Purple.
- Mr. Brooke has blue eyes

788
00:47:36,723 --> 00:47:39,225
and an old soul, which is
more important than money.

789
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:41,227
Has anyone taken my novel?

790
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,262
- No.
- No. Why?

791
00:47:54,273 --> 00:47:55,676
Amy, you've got it.

792
00:47:55,809 --> 00:47:57,343
- No, I haven't.
- That's a lie.

793
00:47:57,477 --> 00:48:00,346
I haven't got it, I don't know
where it is, and I don't care.

794
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,048
- Tell me, or I'll make you!
- Ahh!

795
00:48:02,181 --> 00:48:04,283
- I burnt it up!
- Marmee!

796
00:48:04,417 --> 00:48:08,521
I burnt your book. I told you
I'd make you pay, and I did!

797
00:48:08,655 --> 00:48:11,224
All right, Jo! Jo! Jo!
Please get off her!

798
00:48:11,357 --> 00:48:12,893
- Jo. Amy.
- Ahh! Ahh!

799
00:48:13,025 --> 00:48:14,327
- Get her off!
- I hate you!

800
00:48:22,001 --> 00:48:23,871
I'm sorry, Jo.

801
00:48:24,771 --> 00:48:26,305
Amy.

802
00:48:32,278 --> 00:48:35,014
It's just the only thing
you care about is your writing.

803
00:48:35,147 --> 00:48:36,783
It's not as if
I could've hurt you

804
00:48:36,917 --> 00:48:38,451
by ruining one of your dresses,

805
00:48:38,584 --> 00:48:40,453
and I really did
want to hurt you.

806
00:48:42,355 --> 00:48:46,158
I am the most sorry for it now.
I'm so sorry.

807
00:48:46,292 --> 00:48:48,327
Oh, Jo...

808
00:48:48,461 --> 00:48:50,964
don't let the sun go down
on your anger.

809
00:48:51,097 --> 00:48:52,733
Forgive her.

810
00:48:52,866 --> 00:48:54,200
Help each other.

811
00:48:55,334 --> 00:48:57,069
And you begin again tomorrow.

812
00:48:59,171 --> 00:49:01,875
She doesn't deserve
my forgiveness.

813
00:49:02,009 --> 00:49:05,712
And I will hate her.
I will hate her forever!

814
00:49:36,542 --> 00:49:39,278
Morning. Brisk and brilliant
out. Last day at the river.

815
00:49:39,412 --> 00:49:40,546
- Get your ice skates.
- Let's go!

816
00:49:40,681 --> 00:49:41,782
Jo, you promised me

817
00:49:41,915 --> 00:49:43,583
I could come last time. Jo!

818
00:49:46,385 --> 00:49:48,254
Is she going to be
like this forever?

819
00:49:49,422 --> 00:49:51,457
It was a very hard loss
for her.

820
00:49:51,591 --> 00:49:53,794
Is there nothing I can do?

821
00:49:55,929 --> 00:49:58,230
Go after her.
Don't say anything

822
00:49:58,364 --> 00:50:00,299
till Jo has got good-natured
with Laurie,

823
00:50:00,433 --> 00:50:02,401
and then just say
some kind thing.

824
00:50:02,535 --> 00:50:04,605
I'm sure
she'll be friends again.

825
00:50:04,738 --> 00:50:07,007
Jo, wait!

826
00:50:07,139 --> 00:50:08,942
I'm coming!

827
00:50:09,076 --> 00:50:11,678
You said
I could come last time!

828
00:50:14,081 --> 00:50:16,182
Jo, Laurie, wait!
I'm coming!

829
00:50:17,316 --> 00:50:18,584
Wait!

830
00:50:19,653 --> 00:50:20,954
Jo!

831
00:50:21,088 --> 00:50:22,288
Stay near the edge.

832
00:50:22,421 --> 00:50:24,190
- It's not safe in the middle.
- Got it.

833
00:50:24,323 --> 00:50:25,458
Jo!

834
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:31,297
Jo, I'm coming!

835
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:38,170
Jo!

836
00:50:39,906 --> 00:50:41,273
Jo, let's go!

837
00:50:42,943 --> 00:50:44,077
Uh...

838
00:50:46,479 --> 00:50:47,748
Jo, wait!

839
00:50:55,421 --> 00:50:56,690
Jo!

840
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:08,001
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

841
00:51:08,135 --> 00:51:11,570
- Help! Help me!
- Amy. It's Amy.

842
00:51:11,705 --> 00:51:14,206
- Come on. Come on, Jo.
- Ahh! Jo!

843
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,308
Ahh, Jo!

844
00:51:17,944 --> 00:51:20,212
Jo, get a branch.
Get a branch.

845
00:51:20,346 --> 00:51:21,748
- Amy.
- Jo!

846
00:51:21,882 --> 00:51:23,717
- Amy. Amy.
- Ahh!

847
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:26,419
Help! I can't breathe!

848
00:51:26,552 --> 00:51:30,423
Jo, help me pull. Amy,
grab the branch. Grab it, Amy.

849
00:51:40,767 --> 00:51:43,737
I'm so sorry.
Oh, my sister, my sister.

850
00:51:48,942 --> 00:51:50,376
She's asleep.

851
00:51:53,512 --> 00:51:55,882
If she had died,
it would have been my fault.

852
00:51:56,983 --> 00:51:59,485
She'll be fine.

853
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:03,355
The doctor said that he didn't
even think she'd catch cold.

854
00:52:04,691 --> 00:52:06,159
What is wrong with me?

855
00:52:07,326 --> 00:52:09,062
I've made so many resolutions,

856
00:52:09,196 --> 00:52:13,232
and I've written sad notes,
and I've cried over my sins...

857
00:52:14,835 --> 00:52:17,269
but it just
doesn't seem to help.

858
00:52:19,072 --> 00:52:22,943
When I get in a passion,
I get so savage.

859
00:52:23,076 --> 00:52:25,578
I could hurt anyone,
and I'd enjoy it.

860
00:52:26,847 --> 00:52:28,815
You remind me of myself.

861
00:52:30,917 --> 00:52:33,319
But you're never angry.

862
00:52:33,452 --> 00:52:36,255
I'm angry nearly
every day of my life.

863
00:52:37,456 --> 00:52:39,458
You are?

864
00:52:39,592 --> 00:52:42,863
I am not patient by nature.

865
00:52:42,996 --> 00:52:46,298
But with nearly
40 years of effort,

866
00:52:46,432 --> 00:52:49,069
I'm learning to not let it
get the better of me.

867
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:54,207
Well, I'll do the same, then.

868
00:52:55,942 --> 00:52:58,612
I hope you'll do a great deal
better than me.

869
00:53:01,214 --> 00:53:05,584
There are some natures
too noble to curb

870
00:53:05,719 --> 00:53:08,054
and too lofty to bend.

871
00:53:28,842 --> 00:53:30,644
Jo.

872
00:53:30,777 --> 00:53:33,512
Oh, Beth, my love. Oh!

873
00:53:35,782 --> 00:53:38,885
- You didn't need to come.
- Oh, I never should have left.

874
00:53:39,019 --> 00:53:41,621
Do you need anything? Here.

875
00:53:41,755 --> 00:53:42,989
Take some water.

876
00:53:46,793 --> 00:53:49,296
It's so good
to see your face.

877
00:53:49,428 --> 00:53:52,199
We're going to the sea
to get you strong and well.

878
00:53:52,331 --> 00:53:53,767
- The sea?
- Mm, I want you dancing

879
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:56,335
by the time
Amy gets back.

880
00:53:56,468 --> 00:53:58,370
She's not cutting
her trip short, is she?

881
00:53:58,504 --> 00:54:00,372
- No, no.
- Good.

882
00:54:00,506 --> 00:54:02,943
Is there any news?
What does she say?

883
00:54:03,076 --> 00:54:05,178
She writes
that Laurie is there.

884
00:54:05,312 --> 00:54:07,314
I'm glad he's with her.

885
00:54:07,446 --> 00:54:10,183
He won't respond
to any of my letters.

886
00:54:11,584 --> 00:54:12,986
Do you miss him?

887
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:15,755
I miss everything.

888
00:54:17,691 --> 00:54:18,892
I know.

889
00:54:23,029 --> 00:54:24,865
Hurry up!
Meg's gonna be gone for a week.

890
00:54:24,998 --> 00:54:27,100
- We're coming!
- Take the other carriage, Laurie.

891
00:54:27,234 --> 00:54:29,435
Spy on Meg. Make sure
she doesn't fall in love.

892
00:54:29,568 --> 00:54:30,871
- I will.
- It was nice of Annie

893
00:54:31,004 --> 00:54:32,571
to invite me
to her debutante ball.

894
00:54:32,706 --> 00:54:35,842
- Thank you for letting me go.
- Just be who you are.

895
00:54:35,976 --> 00:54:39,779
And wear this to the ball.
It was mine when I was your age.

896
00:54:39,913 --> 00:54:42,548
I've never understood
saving jewelry until marriage.

897
00:54:42,682 --> 00:54:45,051
You should have something
that's just yours.

898
00:54:45,185 --> 00:54:47,053
Pretty things
should be enjoyed.

899
00:54:47,187 --> 00:54:49,322
Yes, pretty things
should be enjoyed.

900
00:54:50,456 --> 00:54:51,791
- Can I see it?
- Hannah!

901
00:54:51,925 --> 00:54:53,727
I wish I could go
to the debutante ball.

902
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:56,663
Do you think this is a good
idea, her going away like this?

903
00:54:56,796 --> 00:54:58,231
Girls have to
go into the world

904
00:54:58,365 --> 00:55:00,267
and make up
their own minds about things.

905
00:55:00,399 --> 00:55:03,069
- Don't forget about us.
- I won't, Jo. It's only a week.

906
00:55:03,203 --> 00:55:05,071
- It's beautiful.
- It's not yours.

907
00:55:05,205 --> 00:55:06,538
It would look good on me.

908
00:55:06,673 --> 00:55:08,675
She needs to have
some decent shoes.

909
00:55:08,808 --> 00:55:11,577
Thank you for the carriage,
Mr. Laurence.

910
00:55:11,711 --> 00:55:14,114
- I don't know how to repay you.
- Nonsense, nonsense.

911
00:55:14,247 --> 00:55:16,683
I said hi to the horses.
They're very nice.

912
00:55:16,816 --> 00:55:18,218
Although
there is one thing.

913
00:55:18,351 --> 00:55:19,753
It occurred to me today

914
00:55:19,886 --> 00:55:22,622
that my daughter's piano
suffers from want of use.

915
00:55:22,756 --> 00:55:25,091
Any of your girls
like to run over

916
00:55:25,225 --> 00:55:28,728
and practice on it now and then?
Just to keep it in tune.

917
00:55:28,862 --> 00:55:31,264
If they don't care to come,
why, then never mind.

918
00:55:31,398 --> 00:55:34,301
Oh, sir,
they do care.

919
00:55:34,433 --> 00:55:35,501
Very, very much.

920
00:55:36,603 --> 00:55:38,138
You're the musical girl, huh?

921
00:55:38,271 --> 00:55:40,807
I love it dearly.
And I'll come

922
00:55:40,941 --> 00:55:43,743
if you are quite sure nobody
will hear me and be disturbed.

923
00:55:43,877 --> 00:55:45,577
Not a soul, my dear.

924
00:55:49,916 --> 00:55:51,117
- Miss you.
- Bye.

925
00:55:51,251 --> 00:55:53,253
- Can I borrow your ribbons?
- No.

926
00:55:53,386 --> 00:55:55,155
- Bye!
- Be good. Enjoy the ball.

927
00:55:55,288 --> 00:55:58,124
- Bye. I'll be back soon.
- Don't go and get married.

928
00:55:58,258 --> 00:55:59,292
Don't go fall in love.

929
00:55:59,426 --> 00:56:00,894
- Come back right now.
- I love you.

930
00:56:01,027 --> 00:56:02,929
- Right this second.
- Right this second.

931
00:56:14,641 --> 00:56:15,942
Whoa, there.

932
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:23,683
Oh, ha, thank you.

933
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:49,309
I'd be so excited about tonight.

934
00:56:50,844 --> 00:56:53,680
- Of course.
- Oh, no, I don't actually...

935
00:56:55,581 --> 00:56:57,617
What dress will you
wear tonight, Meg?

936
00:56:57,751 --> 00:56:59,352
- I will wear this one.
- That one?

937
00:56:59,486 --> 00:57:00,987
Can't you send home
for another?

938
00:57:01,121 --> 00:57:02,789
- I haven't got another.
- Only the one?

939
00:57:02,922 --> 00:57:05,058
- Oh, that's so funny.
- Not at all.

940
00:57:05,191 --> 00:57:07,494
There's no need
in sending home, Daisy.

941
00:57:07,627 --> 00:57:09,629
I'm going to
call you Daisy now.

942
00:57:09,763 --> 00:57:11,231
I've got a sweet dress
laid away.

943
00:57:11,364 --> 00:57:13,733
You'll wear it to please me,
won't you, Daisy?

944
00:57:13,867 --> 00:57:16,803
- Um, if it's all right.
- Of course.

945
00:57:53,907 --> 00:57:55,542
Everyone's in love
with you, Daisy.

946
00:57:55,675 --> 00:57:58,244
- You have to keep my dress.
- I can't keep your dress.

947
00:57:58,378 --> 00:57:59,746
- You have to. Please.
- No.

948
00:57:59,879 --> 00:58:01,181
Everyone loves you in it.

949
00:58:03,817 --> 00:58:05,418
Have fun, little Daisy.

950
00:58:05,552 --> 00:58:08,021
Laurie. I didn't know
you were going to come.

951
00:58:08,154 --> 00:58:09,756
Supposed to be
a surprise.

952
00:58:09,889 --> 00:58:12,725
And what
a lovely surprise it is.

953
00:58:12,859 --> 00:58:16,229
- Why are they calling you Daisy?
- It's their pet name for me.

954
00:58:18,031 --> 00:58:19,899
Meg is a perfectly
good name.

955
00:58:20,033 --> 00:58:25,138
It's just like playing a part
to be Daisy for a little while.

956
00:58:29,275 --> 00:58:31,077
What would Jo say?

957
00:58:35,615 --> 00:58:38,618
You wouldn't actually marry
one of these men, would you?

958
00:58:40,286 --> 00:58:42,422
I might.

959
00:58:42,555 --> 00:58:44,424
You'll get
a terrible headache tomorrow.

960
00:58:50,296 --> 00:58:53,299
- Do you like how I look?
- No, I don't.

961
00:58:54,634 --> 00:58:56,002
Why not?

962
00:58:56,136 --> 00:58:58,071
I don't like fuss and feathers.

963
00:58:59,372 --> 00:59:01,274
You're the rudest boy
I ever saw.

964
01:00:33,333 --> 01:00:35,101
Please forgive me
and come dance.

965
01:00:35,235 --> 01:00:38,204
I'm afraid it would be
too disagreeable for you.

966
01:00:38,338 --> 01:00:43,409
I don't like your dress, but
I think you are just splendid.

967
01:00:45,613 --> 01:00:47,715
- Really?
- Really.

968
01:00:51,719 --> 01:00:55,488
I know it's silly,
but please don't tell Jo.

969
01:00:55,623 --> 01:00:57,156
Let me have my fun tonight.

970
01:00:57,290 --> 01:01:00,426
I'll be desperately good
for the rest of my life.

971
01:01:31,858 --> 01:01:33,026
I'm sorry, John.

972
01:01:34,394 --> 01:01:37,665
The silk was
the first real expense.

973
01:01:39,767 --> 01:01:44,837
Ahem, $50, while a lot,
is not, I suppose,

974
01:01:44,971 --> 01:01:47,507
too much for a dress
with all the notions

975
01:01:47,641 --> 01:01:50,009
that are needed
to finish it these days.

976
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:57,383
It's not exactly
even a dress yet. It's...

977
01:01:58,652 --> 01:02:01,020
It's just the fabric.

978
01:02:03,089 --> 01:02:04,424
Oh.

979
01:02:05,391 --> 01:02:06,592
I see.

980
01:02:08,161 --> 01:02:09,663
I know you're angry,
John.

981
01:02:09,797 --> 01:02:11,998
I don't mean to waste money,
but I can't resist

982
01:02:12,131 --> 01:02:13,866
when I see Sallie buying
all she wants

983
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,535
and pitying me
because I don't.

984
01:02:17,003 --> 01:02:21,374
I try to be contented,
but it is hard.

985
01:02:21,507 --> 01:02:24,177
And I'm tired of being poor.

986
01:02:26,747 --> 01:02:29,382
I was afraid of this.

987
01:02:29,515 --> 01:02:31,284
I do my best, Meg.

988
01:02:31,417 --> 01:02:32,820
Oh, John.

989
01:02:32,952 --> 01:02:36,055
My dear, kind,
hardworking boy.

990
01:02:36,189 --> 01:02:39,892
It was so ungrateful
and wicked.

991
01:02:40,026 --> 01:02:42,228
How could I say it?

992
01:02:42,362 --> 01:02:45,064
- Perhaps you meant it.
- No, I didn't.

993
01:02:45,198 --> 01:02:47,533
We'll work out a way
to get you your coat as well,

994
01:02:47,668 --> 01:02:50,570
and then won't we be grand,
the two of us?

995
01:02:50,704 --> 01:02:53,206
I can't afford it,
my dear.

996
01:02:53,339 --> 01:02:56,242
- John.
- I need to go to bed.

997
01:02:56,376 --> 01:02:57,678
John.

998
01:03:00,346 --> 01:03:03,851
And I really am very sorry
that you've had to do

999
01:03:03,983 --> 01:03:05,985
without so many
beautiful things...

1000
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:08,187
and that you're married
to someone

1001
01:03:08,321 --> 01:03:10,390
who can't give
them to you.

1002
01:03:21,501 --> 01:03:22,435
Hello, Amy.

1003
01:03:22,568 --> 01:03:24,237
I don't want to see you.

1004
01:03:24,370 --> 01:03:27,006
Amy, don't be mad at me.
I'm sorry for how I behaved.

1005
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:29,777
- Have you been drinking?
- Why are you being so hard on me?

1006
01:03:29,909 --> 01:03:32,078
- It's 4 p.m.
- Someone has to do it.

1007
01:03:33,847 --> 01:03:36,949
When do you begin your
great work of art, Raphaella?

1008
01:03:37,083 --> 01:03:40,153
- Never.
- "Never"? What? Why?

1009
01:03:40,286 --> 01:03:42,221
I'm a failure.

1010
01:03:42,355 --> 01:03:43,990
Jo is in New York
being a writer,

1011
01:03:44,123 --> 01:03:45,291
and I'm a failure.

1012
01:03:45,425 --> 01:03:47,427
That's quite a statement
to make at 20.

1013
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,162
Rome took all the vanity
out of me,

1014
01:03:49,295 --> 01:03:51,564
and Paris made me realize
I'd never be a genius,

1015
01:03:51,698 --> 01:03:54,000
so I'm giving up
all my foolish artistic hopes.

1016
01:03:54,133 --> 01:03:56,402
Why give up? You have
so much talent and energy.

1017
01:03:56,536 --> 01:03:58,237
Talent isn't genius.

1018
01:03:58,371 --> 01:04:00,908
And no amount of energy
can make it so.

1019
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,142
I want to be great
or nothing.

1020
01:04:03,276 --> 01:04:05,779
And I will not be
some commonplace dauber,

1021
01:04:05,913 --> 01:04:08,114
and I don't intend
to try anymore.

1022
01:04:12,952 --> 01:04:16,255
What women are allowed into
the club of geniuses anyway?

1023
01:04:19,793 --> 01:04:22,128
- The Brontes?
- Hm.

1024
01:04:22,261 --> 01:04:23,963
- That's it?
- Yes, I think so.

1025
01:04:24,096 --> 01:04:26,667
And who always
declares genius?

1026
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,902
- Men, I suppose.
- Cutting down the competition.

1027
01:04:30,236 --> 01:04:31,939
That's a very
complicated argument

1028
01:04:32,071 --> 01:04:33,172
to make me feel better.

1029
01:04:33,306 --> 01:04:34,842
Do you though?
Do you feel better?

1030
01:04:34,974 --> 01:04:38,010
I do think,
male or female,

1031
01:04:38,144 --> 01:04:40,980
- I am of middling talent.
- "Middling talent"?

1032
01:04:47,253 --> 01:04:50,490
Then may I ask
your last portrait be of me?

1033
01:04:50,624 --> 01:04:52,391
- All right.
- Now that you've given up

1034
01:04:52,525 --> 01:04:55,662
- your foolish artistic hopes...
- Mm-hm?

1035
01:04:55,796 --> 01:04:57,497
what are you gonna do
with your life?

1036
01:04:57,631 --> 01:04:59,365
Polish up all my other talents

1037
01:04:59,499 --> 01:05:02,368
and become
an ornament to society.

1038
01:05:02,502 --> 01:05:04,905
Mm, that's where Fred Vaughn
comes in, I suppose.

1039
01:05:05,037 --> 01:05:08,374
- Don't make fun.
- I said his name.

1040
01:05:08,508 --> 01:05:11,043
- You're not engaged, I hope.
- No.

1041
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:17,450
But you will be if he goes down
properly on one knee?

1042
01:05:18,986 --> 01:05:20,553
Most likely, yes.

1043
01:05:20,687 --> 01:05:24,223
He's rich.
Richer than you, even.

1044
01:05:24,357 --> 01:05:27,126
I understand queens of society
can't get on without money,

1045
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:28,629
although it does sound odd

1046
01:05:28,762 --> 01:05:31,230
from the mouth of one
of your mother's girls.

1047
01:05:32,833 --> 01:05:35,034
I've always known
I would marry rich.

1048
01:05:35,167 --> 01:05:37,503
- Why should I be ashamed?
- Nothing to be ashamed of,

1049
01:05:37,638 --> 01:05:39,305
as long as you love him.

1050
01:05:39,438 --> 01:05:41,742
I believe we have
some power over who we love.

1051
01:05:41,875 --> 01:05:44,176
It isn't something
that just happens to a person.

1052
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:46,680
I think the poets
might disagree.

1053
01:05:46,813 --> 01:05:48,581
Well, I'm not a poet.

1054
01:05:48,715 --> 01:05:50,182
I'm just a woman.

1055
01:05:52,051 --> 01:05:56,455
And as a woman, there's no way
for me to make my own money.

1056
01:05:56,589 --> 01:06:00,928
Not enough to earn a living
or to support my family.

1057
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:03,095
If I had my own money,
which I don't,

1058
01:06:03,229 --> 01:06:04,932
that money would belong
to my husband

1059
01:06:05,064 --> 01:06:06,532
the moment we got married.

1060
01:06:06,667 --> 01:06:09,402
If we had children,
they would be his, not mine.

1061
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:12,505
They would be his property.
So don't sit there and tell me

1062
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:15,776
that marriage isn't an economic
proposition, because it is.

1063
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:20,279
It may not be for you,
but it most certainly is for me.

1064
01:06:23,416 --> 01:06:26,185
Oh, that's Fred.
Can you unbutton me, please?

1065
01:06:44,136 --> 01:06:45,171
Thank you.

1066
01:06:52,578 --> 01:06:54,014
How do I look?
Do I look all right?

1067
01:06:54,146 --> 01:06:56,248
You look beautiful.

1068
01:06:59,653 --> 01:07:01,120
You are beautiful.

1069
01:07:10,797 --> 01:07:12,666
Fred!

1070
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:14,300
I've missed you.

1071
01:07:32,919 --> 01:07:34,921
This is Fred Vaughn
and his sister, Kate.

1072
01:07:35,055 --> 01:07:36,522
Of course you know
Mr. Brooke.

1073
01:07:36,657 --> 01:07:38,859
This is Meg, Amy,
Beth and Jo.

1074
01:07:38,992 --> 01:07:42,361
- So pleased to meet you.
- Oh, how elegant. Heh.

1075
01:07:42,495 --> 01:07:44,965
I'm Amy March.
You remember that name.

1076
01:07:45,098 --> 01:07:46,800
I'm gonna find you
one day in London.

1077
01:07:46,933 --> 01:07:48,234
Oh, I certainly will.

1078
01:08:11,792 --> 01:08:14,027
- Oh, that missed a boat.
- That's very kind.

1079
01:08:16,863 --> 01:08:18,397
- Well...
- Sorry.

1080
01:08:18,531 --> 01:08:20,533
I know
something you don't know.

1081
01:08:20,667 --> 01:08:21,802
Tell me this second.

1082
01:08:21,935 --> 01:08:23,637
Has Meg perhaps
mislaid a glove?

1083
01:08:24,971 --> 01:08:26,338
- Mr. Brooke has it!
- Yes.

1084
01:08:26,472 --> 01:08:27,674
- How do you know?
- I saw it.

1085
01:08:27,808 --> 01:08:28,742
- Where?
- In his pocket.

1086
01:08:28,875 --> 01:08:29,976
- All this time?
- Yes.

1087
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:31,845
- Isn't it romantic?
- No, it's horrid.

1088
01:08:31,978 --> 01:08:34,313
- I thought you'd be pleased.
- At the idea of anybody

1089
01:08:34,447 --> 01:08:36,215
coming to take Meg away?
No, thank you.

1090
01:08:36,348 --> 01:08:38,985
You'll feel better when
somebody comes to take you away.

1091
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:40,386
I'd like to see anyone try.

1092
01:08:40,519 --> 01:08:42,555
I would like to see
someone try as well.

1093
01:08:48,895 --> 01:08:51,865
<i>"We could never have
loved the earth so well</i>

1094
01:08:51,998 --> 01:08:54,735
<i>"if we had had
no childhood in it,</i>

1095
01:08:54,868 --> 01:08:56,469
<i>"if it were not the earth</i>

1096
01:08:56,603 --> 01:08:59,873
<i>"where the same flowers come up
again every spring</i>

1097
01:09:00,006 --> 01:09:03,542
<i>"that we used to gather
with our tiny fingers.</i>

1098
01:09:03,677 --> 01:09:06,747
<i>"What novelty is worth
that sweet monotony</i>

1099
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,783
"where everything is known
and loved

1100
01:09:09,916 --> 01:09:11,550
because it is known?"

1101
01:09:12,919 --> 01:09:15,488
- How great is that?
- Mm.

1102
01:09:15,622 --> 01:09:17,224
I love to listen
to you read, Jo,

1103
01:09:17,356 --> 01:09:20,093
but I love it better when you
read stories you've written.

1104
01:09:20,227 --> 01:09:22,361
I don't have any new stories.

1105
01:09:22,495 --> 01:09:23,596
Why not?

1106
01:09:27,601 --> 01:09:28,869
Haven't written any.

1107
01:09:30,237 --> 01:09:31,738
You have a pencil and paper.

1108
01:09:31,872 --> 01:09:33,539
Sit here
and write me something.

1109
01:09:35,441 --> 01:09:36,743
I-I can't.

1110
01:09:38,011 --> 01:09:41,114
I don't think
I can anymore.

1111
01:09:41,248 --> 01:09:42,548
Why?

1112
01:09:42,682 --> 01:09:44,050
It's just...

1113
01:09:44,184 --> 01:09:47,721
no one even cares
to hear my stories anyway.

1114
01:09:47,854 --> 01:09:50,157
Write something for me.

1115
01:09:51,490 --> 01:09:53,260
You are a writer.

1116
01:09:53,425 --> 01:09:55,796
Even before anyone knew
or paid you.

1117
01:09:55,929 --> 01:09:57,864
I'm very sick, and you must
do what I say.

1118
01:10:00,834 --> 01:10:02,936
Do what Marmee
taught us to do.

1119
01:10:03,069 --> 01:10:05,437
Do it for someone else.

1120
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,642
If you're walking to Vermont,

1121
01:10:08,775 --> 01:10:11,812
there's a Mrs. Sewall
in Keene, New Hampshire,

1122
01:10:11,945 --> 01:10:13,512
who will give you
room and board.

1123
01:10:13,647 --> 01:10:15,015
There you are.

1124
01:10:15,148 --> 01:10:17,184
You should go home.
I can take care of this.

1125
01:10:17,316 --> 01:10:19,518
No, I need to be here.

1126
01:10:19,653 --> 01:10:22,022
I've spent my whole life
ashamed of my country.

1127
01:10:22,155 --> 01:10:25,192
No offense meant,
but you should still be ashamed.

1128
01:10:25,324 --> 01:10:26,993
I know. I am.

1129
01:10:33,934 --> 01:10:36,603
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, ma'am.

1130
01:10:36,736 --> 01:10:38,370
Do you have sons in the Army?

1131
01:10:39,572 --> 01:10:41,274
Yes, ma'am.
I had four.

1132
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:45,645
But two were killed,
and one is a prisoner.

1133
01:10:45,779 --> 01:10:47,346
I'm going to the other,

1134
01:10:47,479 --> 01:10:49,783
who's very sick
in a Washington hospital.

1135
01:10:51,985 --> 01:10:55,088
You've done a great deal
for your country, sir.

1136
01:10:55,222 --> 01:11:00,526
I'd go myself if I was any use,
but as I ain't, I give my boys.

1137
01:11:03,897 --> 01:11:06,766
Sir, I'll get you a blanket...

1138
01:11:11,137 --> 01:11:13,273
to keep you warm.

1139
01:11:17,244 --> 01:11:20,013
- Thank you. God bless.
- Bless you, sir.

1140
01:11:20,146 --> 01:11:24,583
Mrs. March. Telegram
from Washington, ma'am.

1141
01:11:24,718 --> 01:11:28,387
- Is Jo back yet from Aunt March?
- No, I haven't seen her yet.

1142
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:30,757
- I've got it!
- Want another pair of shoes?

1143
01:11:30,891 --> 01:11:33,894
Thank you. I can't miss
the last train.

1144
01:11:34,027 --> 01:11:36,763
- Did you get Father's shirts?
- Yes, I did.

1145
01:11:36,897 --> 01:11:38,564
What can I do to help, Beth?

1146
01:11:38,698 --> 01:11:40,499
- Thank you for being here.
- Of course.

1147
01:11:40,634 --> 01:11:43,502
- You find the blanket?
- If I may be of more assistance,

1148
01:11:43,637 --> 01:11:45,105
please tell me.

1149
01:11:45,238 --> 01:11:47,040
I'll look in on the girls
without fail.

1150
01:11:47,173 --> 01:11:48,909
Do we need
more books or cloth?

1151
01:11:49,042 --> 01:11:51,044
- Thank you.
- I've always admired your husband.

1152
01:11:51,177 --> 01:11:52,511
I pray for a quick recovery.

1153
01:11:52,646 --> 01:11:54,047
I found these linens.

1154
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:56,482
- Hannah, medicine?
- The medicine is packed.

1155
01:11:56,616 --> 01:11:58,584
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I came to offer myself

1156
01:11:58,718 --> 01:11:59,953
as escort to your mother.

1157
01:12:00,086 --> 01:12:02,088
Mr. Laurence has commissions
in Washington.

1158
01:12:02,222 --> 01:12:05,158
It would give me satisfaction
to be of service to her there.

1159
01:12:05,292 --> 01:12:07,294
- Oh!
- Thank you.

1160
01:12:07,426 --> 01:12:08,728
Of course.

1161
01:12:10,397 --> 01:12:11,932
All right, while I'm gone,

1162
01:12:12,065 --> 01:12:13,133
Hannah is in charge.

1163
01:12:13,266 --> 01:12:14,834
Remember to check
on the Hummels.

1164
01:12:14,968 --> 01:12:17,003
It will be a difficult winter
for everyone.

1165
01:12:17,137 --> 01:12:19,471
Will this be enough
for the train?

1166
01:12:19,606 --> 01:12:21,274
Twenty-five dollars?

1167
01:12:21,408 --> 01:12:23,475
That's not like Aunt March
to be so generous.

1168
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:25,511
I didn't go to her.
I couldn't bear to.

1169
01:12:25,645 --> 01:12:28,248
- Where'd you get the money?
- I only sold what was my own.

1170
01:12:28,381 --> 01:12:31,418
- Oh!
- Jo! Your hair!

1171
01:12:31,550 --> 01:12:33,552
- Your one beauty.
- You look like a boy.

1172
01:12:33,687 --> 01:12:37,824
Well, it doesn't affect the fate
of the nation, so don't wail.

1173
01:12:37,958 --> 01:12:40,327
Oh, I'm so proud
you're my daughter.

1174
01:12:40,492 --> 01:12:42,796
I was just crazy
to do something for Father.

1175
01:12:42,929 --> 01:12:44,798
It'll be good
for my vanity anyway.

1176
01:12:44,931 --> 01:12:46,465
- That could be nice.
- Never do that.

1177
01:12:46,598 --> 01:12:48,735
- Isn't what I wanted for her.
- Oh, Teddy.

1178
01:12:50,704 --> 01:12:52,772
Oh, Jo.

1179
01:12:52,906 --> 01:12:55,574
My girls,
I love you more than words can say.

1180
01:12:55,709 --> 01:12:58,778
Be good to each other.
Pray for Father's recovery.

1181
01:12:58,912 --> 01:13:02,182
And I'll be back as soon
as I can. Love you.

1182
01:13:09,856 --> 01:13:11,391
Jo.

1183
01:13:13,159 --> 01:13:15,628
What is it? Is it Father?

1184
01:13:15,762 --> 01:13:16,896
No.

1185
01:13:18,031 --> 01:13:20,033
It's my hair.

1186
01:13:24,871 --> 01:13:27,539
I would feel the same way.

1187
01:13:27,674 --> 01:13:29,376
I know you would.

1188
01:13:32,245 --> 01:13:34,848
<i>Laurie, when are you
going back to your grandfather?</i>

1189
01:13:34,981 --> 01:13:36,483
Very soon.

1190
01:13:38,084 --> 01:13:40,153
You've said that a dozen times
in the past month.

1191
01:13:40,286 --> 01:13:41,520
Short answers
save trouble.

1192
01:13:41,654 --> 01:13:43,156
Well, he is expecting you,

1193
01:13:43,289 --> 01:13:45,325
so why don't you do it?

1194
01:13:45,458 --> 01:13:49,329
- Natural depravity, I suppose.
- Natural indolence, you mean.

1195
01:13:49,462 --> 01:13:50,997
I'll only plague him if I go,

1196
01:13:51,131 --> 01:13:53,233
so I might as well stay
and plague you longer.

1197
01:13:53,366 --> 01:13:56,002
You can bear it. In fact,
I think it agrees with you.

1198
01:13:56,136 --> 01:13:58,038
Stop it. Stop.

1199
01:14:02,574 --> 01:14:04,944
- What are you doing?
- I'm looking at you.

1200
01:14:05,078 --> 01:14:07,881
I mean, what do you
intend to do?

1201
01:14:08,014 --> 01:14:09,015
- With life?
- Yes.

1202
01:14:09,149 --> 01:14:10,717
I've been writing an opera.

1203
01:14:10,850 --> 01:14:14,254
- I would be the central figure.
- That's a waste of time.

1204
01:14:14,387 --> 01:14:16,555
What would you have me do?

1205
01:14:25,732 --> 01:14:28,902
Go and work for your grandfather
and make something of yourself.

1206
01:14:29,035 --> 01:14:31,671
You're not playing fair.

1207
01:14:36,676 --> 01:14:37,777
Here.

1208
01:14:41,848 --> 01:14:43,850
That's... That's very good.

1209
01:14:45,518 --> 01:14:46,886
When did you do this one?

1210
01:14:48,655 --> 01:14:50,390
It was the day at the beach.

1211
01:14:51,724 --> 01:14:53,626
First time I met Fred.

1212
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:54,861
That's right.

1213
01:15:00,867 --> 01:15:02,035
What's he doing?

1214
01:15:04,938 --> 01:15:09,008
He's in London on business.
He'll be back in a few weeks.

1215
01:15:26,726 --> 01:15:28,294
Don't marry him.

1216
01:15:30,096 --> 01:15:31,164
What?

1217
01:15:34,467 --> 01:15:35,735
Don't marry him.

1218
01:15:37,605 --> 01:15:38,905
Why?

1219
01:15:39,038 --> 01:15:41,141
Why? You know why.

1220
01:15:45,378 --> 01:15:47,615
No. No.

1221
01:15:47,747 --> 01:15:49,682
- Yes.
- No. Laurie.

1222
01:15:49,816 --> 01:15:51,284
- What?
- You're being mean.

1223
01:15:51,417 --> 01:15:53,953
- Stop it. Stop it.
- What? How am I being mean?

1224
01:15:54,087 --> 01:15:57,857
I have been second to Jo
my whole life in everything.

1225
01:15:57,991 --> 01:16:00,360
I will not be
the person you settle for

1226
01:16:00,493 --> 01:16:02,362
just because
you cannot have her.

1227
01:16:02,495 --> 01:16:04,164
I won't. I won't do it.

1228
01:16:07,767 --> 01:16:11,971
I won't. Not when I've spent
my entire life loving you.

1229
01:16:24,652 --> 01:16:26,886
I'm making a mold
of my foot for Laurie

1230
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:28,922
to remind him
I have nice feet.

1231
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:34,160
Mr. Brooke writes that Father is
still very weak but improving.

1232
01:16:34,294 --> 01:16:36,029
Mr. Brooke also says
that Mother

1233
01:16:36,162 --> 01:16:37,964
is the best nurse
a man could ask for.

1234
01:16:38,097 --> 01:16:40,867
I wish all the letters were
from Mother and not Mr. Brooke.

1235
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,535
I'm grateful for any letters.

1236
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:45,138
I think the purple is
very fitting for Mr. Laurence.

1237
01:16:45,271 --> 01:16:46,339
- Do you agree, Amy?
- Quite.

1238
01:16:46,472 --> 01:16:47,740
The design is very cunning.

1239
01:16:47,874 --> 01:16:49,409
I had to thank him
for allowing me

1240
01:16:49,542 --> 01:16:51,578
to play the piano
at his house all the time.

1241
01:16:51,711 --> 01:16:53,012
I'm going for groceries.

1242
01:16:53,146 --> 01:16:55,014
- Jo, can you get more firewood?
- Mm-hm.

1243
01:16:55,148 --> 01:16:57,250
You haven't been to
the Hummels. We should go.

1244
01:16:57,383 --> 01:16:59,385
We barely have enough
to feed ourselves.

1245
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:01,020
I have to finish this story.

1246
01:17:01,154 --> 01:17:03,089
- Marmee said...
- Marmee told us to do lots,

1247
01:17:03,223 --> 01:17:04,824
but we can't
possibly do them all.

1248
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:07,560
I always go myself. You haven't
kept up with your tasks.

1249
01:17:07,695 --> 01:17:10,763
- We do. We work.
- Don't worry. We'll find a time.

1250
01:17:10,897 --> 01:17:12,465
- But it's been weeks.
- We'll go soon.

1251
01:17:12,599 --> 01:17:14,567
My foot is stuck!
I can't get it out!

1252
01:17:14,702 --> 01:17:17,770
Stop it, Jo! I can't get it out!

1253
01:17:17,904 --> 01:17:20,273
I'm going to lose my foot. Ow!

1254
01:17:20,406 --> 01:17:22,108
Fine. I'll go myself.

1255
01:17:25,245 --> 01:17:28,214
Hello. For Mr. Laurence.

1256
01:17:39,459 --> 01:17:40,793
Oh! Here she comes.

1257
01:17:50,937 --> 01:17:52,606
Beth, look what
they got you!

1258
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:54,173
A letter from
the old gentleman.

1259
01:17:54,307 --> 01:17:56,242
Open the note.

1260
01:17:56,376 --> 01:17:57,944
Oh, Beth, just look.

1261
01:18:02,482 --> 01:18:05,952
Jo, read the letter.
I cannot.

1262
01:18:06,085 --> 01:18:07,920
"Miss Beth March,
I have had

1263
01:18:08,054 --> 01:18:09,922
"many pairs of slippers
in my life,

1264
01:18:10,056 --> 01:18:13,326
"but I never had any
that suited me so well as yours.

1265
01:18:13,459 --> 01:18:16,229
"And they will always remind me
of the gentle giver.

1266
01:18:16,362 --> 01:18:19,733
"I like to pay my debts and hope
you will accept this gift.

1267
01:18:19,866 --> 01:18:23,136
Your grateful friend and
humble servant, James Laurence."

1268
01:18:23,269 --> 01:18:26,105
Oh, Beth!
So sweet. "Your humble servant."

1269
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:28,308
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Look how shiny it is!

1270
01:18:28,441 --> 01:18:29,777
- Yes.
- It has gold that goes

1271
01:18:29,909 --> 01:18:31,911
- all the way around.
- All the way around!

1272
01:18:32,045 --> 01:18:35,415
- His handwriting is beautiful.
- It's got a little drawer here.

1273
01:18:47,994 --> 01:18:51,431
Sir, I wanted
to thank you for...

1274
01:19:02,743 --> 01:19:05,111
You remind me...

1275
01:19:05,244 --> 01:19:07,280
so much of my little girl.

1276
01:19:08,615 --> 01:19:09,717
Hm?

1277
01:19:10,983 --> 01:19:12,385
The piano is yours.

1278
01:19:12,518 --> 01:19:14,822
I should have given it
to you long ago.

1279
01:19:14,954 --> 01:19:16,389
Thank you.

1280
01:19:17,691 --> 01:19:18,826
My child...

1281
01:19:20,393 --> 01:19:21,928
you're burning.

1282
01:19:23,496 --> 01:19:25,666
The Hummels
are very sick.

1283
01:19:36,075 --> 01:19:37,210
She's resting.

1284
01:19:37,343 --> 01:19:39,445
How is she?
Is there anything I can do?

1285
01:19:39,579 --> 01:19:41,180
- What is it?
- Scarlet fever.

1286
01:19:41,314 --> 01:19:42,281
What's scarlet fever?

1287
01:19:42,415 --> 01:19:43,549
I visited the Hummels.

1288
01:19:43,684 --> 01:19:44,917
The baby has died.

1289
01:19:45,051 --> 01:19:46,754
Have you all
had it before?

1290
01:19:46,886 --> 01:19:49,956
- Meg and I have, but Amy hasn't.
- She'll have to be sent away.

1291
01:19:50,089 --> 01:19:51,424
I don't want
to be sent away.

1292
01:19:51,557 --> 01:19:53,861
- Aunt March can take her.
- I don't like Aunt March.

1293
01:19:53,993 --> 01:19:56,697
- It's for your own good, child.
- Should we send for Mother?

1294
01:19:56,830 --> 01:19:58,264
Now, we shouldn't
worry her.

1295
01:19:58,398 --> 01:20:00,533
I've never wished for money
more than now.

1296
01:20:00,667 --> 01:20:04,738
Listen, we'll nurse her
and she'll get better.

1297
01:20:04,872 --> 01:20:06,105
She will.

1298
01:20:08,241 --> 01:20:11,978
"The post office in the forest
was a capital little institution

1299
01:20:12,111 --> 01:20:13,579
"and flourished wonderfully,

1300
01:20:13,714 --> 01:20:15,515
"for many things
passed through it.

1301
01:20:15,649 --> 01:20:19,285
"Poetry and pickles,
music and gingerbread,

1302
01:20:19,419 --> 01:20:22,355
invitations, scoldings
and even puppies."

1303
01:20:24,924 --> 01:20:26,794
- It's all about us.
- It is.

1304
01:20:28,361 --> 01:20:30,430
- I love it.
- Mm, it's just a little story.

1305
01:20:30,563 --> 01:20:32,198
Nothing like
what you usually write.

1306
01:20:32,331 --> 01:20:34,567
- Think it's too boring?
- No, it's my favorite one.

1307
01:20:34,701 --> 01:20:36,102
- Really?
- Write me another.

1308
01:20:36,235 --> 01:20:37,638
- Yes, ma'am.
- Keep writing them.

1309
01:20:37,771 --> 01:20:40,239
- I will.
- Even when I'm not here.

1310
01:20:44,243 --> 01:20:46,579
- Don't say that. Don't say it.
- I have to tell you.

1311
01:20:46,713 --> 01:20:48,749
- No, you don't.
- I've had a very long time

1312
01:20:48,882 --> 01:20:50,818
to think about this, and...

1313
01:20:50,950 --> 01:20:53,319
- And I'm not afraid.
- No.

1314
01:20:53,453 --> 01:20:54,822
Nope.

1315
01:20:58,124 --> 01:20:59,492
It's like the tide going out.

1316
01:20:59,626 --> 01:21:01,895
It goes out slowly,
but it can't be stopped.

1317
01:21:08,468 --> 01:21:10,336
I'll stop it.

1318
01:21:24,852 --> 01:21:26,986
I stopped it before.

1319
01:21:43,269 --> 01:21:45,973
You will get better,
Father will get better,

1320
01:21:46,105 --> 01:21:48,241
and we'll all be
together soon, all right?

1321
01:21:49,542 --> 01:21:51,310
We...

1322
01:21:51,444 --> 01:21:53,012
We can't stop God's will.

1323
01:21:53,145 --> 01:21:55,348
Well, God hasn't met
my will yet.

1324
01:21:55,481 --> 01:21:57,818
What Jo wills
shall be done.

1325
01:22:14,066 --> 01:22:15,401
Amy.

1326
01:22:15,535 --> 01:22:17,069
Come here.

1327
01:22:23,610 --> 01:22:25,913
- Yes?
- Come, sit.

1328
01:22:33,620 --> 01:22:37,390
If you are very good, one day,
this ring will belong to you.

1329
01:22:40,126 --> 01:22:42,094
- Really?
- If you keep being

1330
01:22:42,228 --> 01:22:44,330
a proper young lady,
just see if it doesn't.

1331
01:22:49,335 --> 01:22:51,337
You are your family's
hope now.

1332
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:55,441
Beth is sick,
Jo is a lost cause,

1333
01:22:55,575 --> 01:22:57,678
and I hear Meg
has had her head turned

1334
01:22:57,811 --> 01:22:59,846
by a penniless tutor, so...

1335
01:23:01,414 --> 01:23:04,851
it'll be up to you
to support them all.

1336
01:23:06,653 --> 01:23:09,121
And your indigent parents
in their old age.

1337
01:23:10,691 --> 01:23:12,291
So you must marry well.

1338
01:23:13,894 --> 01:23:14,895
Hm?

1339
01:23:17,030 --> 01:23:18,431
Save your family.

1340
01:23:21,802 --> 01:23:22,936
All right, that's, uh...

1341
01:23:23,070 --> 01:23:26,073
That's all I wanted
to say to you.

1342
01:23:26,205 --> 01:23:29,910
So you can go back
and do your little painting.

1343
01:23:38,317 --> 01:23:41,088
- Hello, Aunt March.
- Oh.

1344
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:43,790
That Laurence boy
was just here.

1345
01:23:43,924 --> 01:23:46,158
- He was?
- What a disappointment

1346
01:23:46,292 --> 01:23:48,095
he's turned out to be.

1347
01:23:48,260 --> 01:23:49,930
Must be the Italian in him.

1348
01:23:50,063 --> 01:23:52,131
Uh, when...
When will he be back?

1349
01:23:52,264 --> 01:23:54,635
Mm, he's gone.

1350
01:23:54,768 --> 01:23:55,969
To London.

1351
01:23:57,738 --> 01:23:58,839
Why?

1352
01:24:00,172 --> 01:24:02,441
What do you need
to discuss with him?

1353
01:24:16,657 --> 01:24:20,627
I... I just told Fred Vaughn
I wouldn't marry him.

1354
01:24:44,517 --> 01:24:45,551
Meg.

1355
01:24:52,358 --> 01:24:54,493
<i>I'll come home to
help with the children.</i>

1356
01:24:54,628 --> 01:24:56,562
I just... I'm so worried
for Beth.

1357
01:24:56,697 --> 01:24:59,465
Stay. I asked for leave. I will
take care of the children.

1358
01:24:59,598 --> 01:25:00,801
Oh, John.

1359
01:25:03,502 --> 01:25:05,371
One other thing.
Send your fabric

1360
01:25:05,504 --> 01:25:07,306
to the dressmaker
as soon as possible.

1361
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:09,475
- I can't.
- I don't want to hear a word.

1362
01:25:09,609 --> 01:25:11,078
I want you to have that dress.

1363
01:25:11,210 --> 01:25:13,512
My old coat will be fine
for the winter.

1364
01:25:13,647 --> 01:25:14,848
- John, I...
- It's all settled.

1365
01:25:14,981 --> 01:25:17,150
John, I really can't.

1366
01:25:17,283 --> 01:25:19,351
I sold the fabric
to Sallie.

1367
01:25:21,487 --> 01:25:22,656
You did?

1368
01:25:24,891 --> 01:25:27,094
I don't want you
to be unhappy.

1369
01:25:27,226 --> 01:25:29,295
I couldn't be.

1370
01:25:29,428 --> 01:25:32,966
John Brooke is my husband.

1371
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:34,634
And I am his wife.

1372
01:25:40,539 --> 01:25:41,942
Oh!

1373
01:25:42,075 --> 01:25:44,878
Hannah! It's all right.
It's all right.

1374
01:25:49,381 --> 01:25:50,884
What do we do?

1375
01:25:52,786 --> 01:25:54,587
We should send for your mother.

1376
01:26:09,870 --> 01:26:11,337
- Marmee!
- Bless you.

1377
01:26:11,470 --> 01:26:13,472
She's worse. I didn't know
what else to do.

1378
01:26:13,607 --> 01:26:15,574
- Jo, how is she?
- My girls.

1379
01:26:15,709 --> 01:26:16,743
My sweet Beth.

1380
01:26:16,877 --> 01:26:18,111
Hannah, make a clear broth.

1381
01:26:18,245 --> 01:26:20,147
Jo, get ice.
We need to cool you.

1382
01:26:21,982 --> 01:26:23,582
Who's with Father?

1383
01:26:23,717 --> 01:26:25,018
John stayed with him.

1384
01:26:25,152 --> 01:26:26,953
We need to change
the linens.

1385
01:26:27,087 --> 01:26:29,555
We're going to move you,
sweet girl.

1386
01:26:29,689 --> 01:26:30,891
- Oh, look at her.
- That's it.

1387
01:26:31,024 --> 01:26:32,092
Hold on. It's okay.

1388
01:26:34,426 --> 01:26:35,896
I know.

1389
01:27:25,812 --> 01:27:27,314
Please fight.

1390
01:27:33,385 --> 01:27:35,588
Don't go quietly.

1391
01:27:35,722 --> 01:27:38,024
Fight.

1392
01:27:38,158 --> 01:27:41,261
Please, please, just fight
to the end and be loud,

1393
01:27:41,393 --> 01:27:43,930
and don't just
quietly go away, Beth.

1394
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:08,121
Marmee?

1395
01:28:11,191 --> 01:28:12,792
Marmee?

1396
01:28:12,926 --> 01:28:14,426
Marmee?

1397
01:28:16,162 --> 01:28:18,965
Oh! Oh!

1398
01:28:19,099 --> 01:28:20,367
Jo.

1399
01:28:24,204 --> 01:28:25,372
Jo.

1400
01:28:27,573 --> 01:28:28,975
Merry Christmas, Beth.

1401
01:28:29,109 --> 01:28:30,877
Popcorn. Make sure
it's in the middle.

1402
01:28:31,011 --> 01:28:32,578
- I know.
- You're doing the sides first.

1403
01:28:32,712 --> 01:28:34,513
The sides aren't spaced
for my popcorn.

1404
01:28:34,648 --> 01:28:36,783
I'm making a popcorn garland.

1405
01:28:36,917 --> 01:28:39,719
You're wasting decorations,
and they're not dangling right.

1406
01:28:39,853 --> 01:28:42,889
The sides are most important.
If you don't have the sides...

1407
01:28:43,023 --> 01:28:45,625
Here's another Christmas gift
for the March family.

1408
01:28:46,826 --> 01:28:49,561
- Oh, my God! Father!
- Father!

1409
01:28:49,696 --> 01:28:50,697
Father!

1410
01:28:54,200 --> 01:28:55,567
My little women.

1411
01:28:57,569 --> 01:28:59,372
How you've grown.

1412
01:29:00,273 --> 01:29:02,108
Oh, Beth.

1413
01:29:02,242 --> 01:29:04,044
Merry Christmas, my dear.

1414
01:29:04,177 --> 01:29:07,113
- Merry Christmas to each of you.
- Merry Christmas, Father.

1415
01:29:07,247 --> 01:29:08,315
Merry Christmas.

1416
01:29:11,051 --> 01:29:12,819
Oh, thank God.

1417
01:29:12,953 --> 01:29:15,922
- Thank God you're home.
- Thank God for you.

1418
01:29:16,056 --> 01:29:18,425
Now I can be angry
with you in person.

1419
01:31:27,253 --> 01:31:30,523
I can't believe
today is my wedding day.

1420
01:31:30,657 --> 01:31:32,425
Mm.

1421
01:31:32,559 --> 01:31:34,227
What's wrong?

1422
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:35,462
Nothing.

1423
01:31:36,396 --> 01:31:37,297
Jo.

1424
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:43,103
We can leave.
We can leave right now.

1425
01:31:43,236 --> 01:31:45,305
I can make money.
I'll sell stories.

1426
01:31:45,438 --> 01:31:47,307
I'll do anything.
I'll cook. I'll clean.

1427
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:49,909
I'll work in a factory.
I can make a life for us.

1428
01:31:50,043 --> 01:31:52,078
- Jo...
- And you should be an actress,

1429
01:31:52,212 --> 01:31:54,147
and you should have a life
on the stage.

1430
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:55,849
Let's just run away together.

1431
01:31:55,982 --> 01:31:58,485
- I want to get married.
- Oh, why?

1432
01:31:58,618 --> 01:32:00,120
Because I love him.

1433
01:32:00,253 --> 01:32:03,289
You will be bored of him
in two years,

1434
01:32:03,423 --> 01:32:05,325
and we will be
interesting forever.

1435
01:32:05,458 --> 01:32:07,660
Just because my dreams
are different than yours

1436
01:32:07,794 --> 01:32:09,829
doesn't mean
they're unimportant.

1437
01:32:11,464 --> 01:32:13,601
I want a home.

1438
01:32:13,733 --> 01:32:17,137
And a family. And I'm willing
to work and struggle.

1439
01:32:17,270 --> 01:32:20,273
But I want to do it
with John.

1440
01:32:25,111 --> 01:32:27,313
I just hate
that you're leaving me.

1441
01:32:28,748 --> 01:32:29,816
Don't leave.

1442
01:32:29,949 --> 01:32:31,284
Oh, Jo.

1443
01:32:34,187 --> 01:32:35,788
I'm not leaving you.

1444
01:32:35,922 --> 01:32:38,158
And besides...

1445
01:32:40,326 --> 01:32:42,762
one day,
it will be your turn.

1446
01:32:49,469 --> 01:32:52,138
I'd rather be a free spinster
and paddle my own canoe.

1447
01:32:53,406 --> 01:32:54,707
I would.

1448
01:33:00,813 --> 01:33:02,982
Can't believe childhood is over.

1449
01:33:05,018 --> 01:33:08,054
It was going to end
one way or another.

1450
01:33:08,188 --> 01:33:09,822
And what a happy end.

1451
01:33:12,258 --> 01:33:14,394
What excessive promises...

1452
01:33:14,527 --> 01:33:17,964
giving yourself away
to get the other.

1453
01:33:18,097 --> 01:33:19,566
What a gift.

1454
01:33:19,699 --> 01:33:24,971
Always given before is known
the cost or the reward.

1455
01:33:25,104 --> 01:33:26,406
I pronounce you
man and wife.

1456
01:33:27,974 --> 01:33:29,909
You may kiss
the bride.

1457
01:34:06,746 --> 01:34:08,716
<i>Oh, don't have to make a fuss.</i>

1458
01:34:08,848 --> 01:34:10,950
You don't need
to see me to the carriage.

1459
01:34:11,084 --> 01:34:12,252
Oh, I'm happy to.

1460
01:34:12,385 --> 01:34:15,088
I hope you will be
happy now...

1461
01:34:15,221 --> 01:34:17,924
that you've ruined your life
the same way your mother did

1462
01:34:18,057 --> 01:34:19,792
by marrying your father.

1463
01:34:19,926 --> 01:34:22,262
My dear sister,
you're too kind.

1464
01:34:22,395 --> 01:34:24,230
And thank you
for today's festivities.

1465
01:34:24,364 --> 01:34:25,398
You're most welcome.

1466
01:34:25,531 --> 01:34:26,833
Thank you, Aunt March.

1467
01:34:26,966 --> 01:34:30,303
Oh, I don't like
to be, uh, kissed.

1468
01:34:30,436 --> 01:34:32,939
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Well, you will be sorry

1469
01:34:33,072 --> 01:34:36,075
when you've tried love in a
cottage and found it a failure.

1470
01:34:36,209 --> 01:34:39,112
It can't be worse than
some people find in big houses.

1471
01:34:39,245 --> 01:34:43,349
Oh, I quite understand
your meaning, missus.

1472
01:34:43,483 --> 01:34:45,018
I don't miss a thing.

1473
01:34:45,151 --> 01:34:46,953
We know this.

1474
01:34:47,086 --> 01:34:50,056
And you're not
entirely wrong.

1475
01:34:50,189 --> 01:34:54,260
I may not always be right,
but I'm never wrong.

1476
01:34:54,394 --> 01:34:58,097
Oh, and here is the only
sane member of the family.

1477
01:34:59,532 --> 01:35:01,267
I really can't take
any more of this.

1478
01:35:01,401 --> 01:35:03,671
- I know.
- You can imagine.

1479
01:35:11,277 --> 01:35:14,414
Marmee! Marmee!
Marmee, Marmee, Marmee!

1480
01:35:14,547 --> 01:35:16,482
- What?
- Aunt March is going to Europe.

1481
01:35:16,617 --> 01:35:19,185
Oh, and she wants me
to go with her! Ha, ha!

1482
01:35:19,319 --> 01:35:21,521
That's wonderful!
Now I know why I spent

1483
01:35:21,655 --> 01:35:23,423
all those boring hours
reading to her.

1484
01:35:23,556 --> 01:35:25,024
No, no,
she wants me to go.

1485
01:35:26,592 --> 01:35:28,461
As her companion.

1486
01:35:28,594 --> 01:35:31,431
- Europe, with you?
- Yes, she wants me

1487
01:35:31,564 --> 01:35:33,701
to work on my art
and my French, of course.

1488
01:35:33,833 --> 01:35:36,936
You don't really
like French though, do you?

1489
01:35:39,238 --> 01:35:40,641
That's wonderful, Amy.

1490
01:35:43,142 --> 01:35:45,845
- Father! I'm going to Europe!
- Oh, ha, ha!

1491
01:36:17,310 --> 01:36:18,746
Meg married.

1492
01:36:18,878 --> 01:36:20,947
Amy off to Europe.

1493
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:25,786
And now that you're a graduate,
you'll be off on a long holiday.

1494
01:36:25,918 --> 01:36:29,088
I'm just not good like Beth,
so I'm angry and restless.

1495
01:36:29,222 --> 01:36:31,859
You don't have
to stay here, Jo.

1496
01:36:31,991 --> 01:36:34,394
Why? Should we run off
and join a pirate ship?

1497
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:42,468
- No. No.
- It's no use, Jo.

1498
01:36:42,603 --> 01:36:43,871
- Don't.
- We gotta have it out.

1499
01:36:44,003 --> 01:36:45,037
- No.
- I have loved you

1500
01:36:45,171 --> 01:36:46,406
ever since I've known you.

1501
01:36:46,539 --> 01:36:47,641
I couldn't help it.

1502
01:36:47,775 --> 01:36:49,877
I tried to show
and you wouldn't let me.

1503
01:36:50,009 --> 01:36:51,845
- No.
- But I must make you hear now

1504
01:36:51,978 --> 01:36:54,547
and give me an answer because
I cannot go on like this!

1505
01:36:54,681 --> 01:36:56,249
- Please don't.
- I gave up billiards.

1506
01:36:56,382 --> 01:36:58,918
I gave up everything you
didn't like. I'm happy I did.

1507
01:36:59,051 --> 01:37:03,556
It's fine, and I waited, and
I never complained because I...

1508
01:37:03,690 --> 01:37:06,926
You know, I figured
you'd love me, Jo.

1509
01:37:07,059 --> 01:37:08,961
And I realize
I'm not half good enough

1510
01:37:09,095 --> 01:37:11,297
- and I'm not this great man...
- No! Yes, you are.

1511
01:37:11,431 --> 01:37:13,099
You're a great deal
too good for me.

1512
01:37:13,232 --> 01:37:16,969
I'm so grateful to you, and I'm
so proud of you, and I just...

1513
01:37:17,103 --> 01:37:20,206
I don't see why I can't
love you as you want me to.

1514
01:37:20,339 --> 01:37:22,275
I don't know why.

1515
01:37:22,408 --> 01:37:23,443
You can't?

1516
01:37:23,576 --> 01:37:25,746
No. I can't.

1517
01:37:25,879 --> 01:37:28,214
I can't change
how I feel, and...

1518
01:37:29,949 --> 01:37:32,585
it would be a lie
to say I do when I don't.

1519
01:37:33,921 --> 01:37:36,222
I'm so sorry, Teddy.

1520
01:37:36,355 --> 01:37:39,125
I'm so sorry,
but I just can't help it.

1521
01:37:39,258 --> 01:37:41,461
I can't love anyone else, Jo.
I only love you.

1522
01:37:41,594 --> 01:37:43,362
It would be a disaster
if we married.

1523
01:37:43,496 --> 01:37:45,231
- It wouldn't be.
- We'd be miserable.

1524
01:37:45,364 --> 01:37:47,266
- I'd be a perfect saint.
- I can't! I can't!

1525
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:48,769
I've tried
and failed. I can't.

1526
01:37:48,902 --> 01:37:50,169
Why does everyone
expect it?

1527
01:37:50,303 --> 01:37:52,138
Your family
and my grandpa expect it.

1528
01:37:52,271 --> 01:37:54,307
Why are you saying this?
Say yes.

1529
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:57,611
- Let's be happy together, Jo!
- I can't say yes truly,

1530
01:37:57,744 --> 01:37:59,312
so I'm not going
to say it at all.

1531
01:37:59,445 --> 01:38:01,682
And you'll see that
I'm right eventually,

1532
01:38:01,815 --> 01:38:03,617
and you'll thank me for it.

1533
01:38:07,754 --> 01:38:09,656
I'd rather hang myself
than realize this.

1534
01:38:09,790 --> 01:38:12,058
- Teddy.
- I would rather be dead.

1535
01:38:12,191 --> 01:38:13,493
Teddy, don't say that.

1536
01:38:14,661 --> 01:38:15,629
Teddy.

1537
01:38:17,363 --> 01:38:21,300
Listen, you'll find
some lovely, accomplished girl

1538
01:38:21,434 --> 01:38:24,003
who will love you
and adore you.

1539
01:38:24,136 --> 01:38:25,571
She's gonna make
a fine mistress

1540
01:38:25,706 --> 01:38:27,841
for your fine house,
but I wouldn't.

1541
01:38:27,975 --> 01:38:29,342
- Yes, you would, Jo.
- Look at me.

1542
01:38:29,475 --> 01:38:31,310
I'm homely, I'm awkward,
and I'm odd.

1543
01:38:31,444 --> 01:38:33,546
- I love you, Jo.
- And you'd be ashamed of me.

1544
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:35,414
- I love you, Jo.
- And we would quarrel

1545
01:38:35,548 --> 01:38:37,583
because we can't help it
even now.

1546
01:38:40,219 --> 01:38:43,356
I'd hate elegant society,
you'd hate my scribbling,

1547
01:38:43,489 --> 01:38:44,725
and we would be unhappy.

1548
01:38:44,858 --> 01:38:46,359
And we'd wish
we hadn't done it,

1549
01:38:46,492 --> 01:38:48,561
and everything
will be horrid.

1550
01:38:50,998 --> 01:38:52,331
Is there anything more?

1551
01:38:53,700 --> 01:38:55,903
- No, nothing more.
- All right.

1552
01:38:56,035 --> 01:38:57,671
Except that...

1553
01:39:01,842 --> 01:39:04,310
Teddy, I don't believe
I will ever marry.

1554
01:39:05,612 --> 01:39:07,146
I'm happy as I am,

1555
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:08,649
and I love my liberty
too well

1556
01:39:08,782 --> 01:39:10,249
to be in any hurry
to give it up.

1557
01:39:10,383 --> 01:39:11,584
- I think you're wrong.
- No.

1558
01:39:11,718 --> 01:39:12,886
I think you will marry.

1559
01:39:13,020 --> 01:39:14,554
You'll find someone
and love them.

1560
01:39:14,688 --> 01:39:16,155
You will live
and die for them.

1561
01:39:16,289 --> 01:39:18,157
That's your way,
and you will.

1562
01:39:21,227 --> 01:39:22,696
And I'll watch.

1563
01:40:00,701 --> 01:40:03,469
Oh. I don't want
to disturb your writing.

1564
01:40:04,570 --> 01:40:06,673
I don't do that anymore.

1565
01:40:08,307 --> 01:40:09,843
It didn't save her.

1566
01:40:26,425 --> 01:40:28,629
You're much too
lonely here, Jo.

1567
01:40:30,363 --> 01:40:33,100
Wouldn't you like
to go back to New York?

1568
01:40:33,232 --> 01:40:34,768
What about your friend
Friedrich?

1569
01:40:34,901 --> 01:40:36,268
- Wasn't that his name?
- No.

1570
01:40:38,005 --> 01:40:40,139
I ruined our friendship
with my temper,

1571
01:40:40,272 --> 01:40:41,675
just as
I ruin everything.

1572
01:40:41,808 --> 01:40:43,342
I'm sure I'll never
see him again.

1573
01:40:43,476 --> 01:40:46,479
I doubt that a sincere friend
would be deterred.

1574
01:40:48,615 --> 01:40:50,282
I wish that were true.

1575
01:40:53,654 --> 01:40:56,990
If I was a girl in a book,
this would all be so easy.

1576
01:40:59,158 --> 01:41:01,327
Just give up
the world happily.

1577
01:41:05,297 --> 01:41:07,668
Laurie's returning, you know.

1578
01:41:07,801 --> 01:41:09,435
- Oh, he is?
- Mm.

1579
01:41:09,568 --> 01:41:12,338
There was a letter from Amy.
She's coming home.

1580
01:41:12,471 --> 01:41:15,307
She's devastated about Beth.

1581
01:41:15,441 --> 01:41:19,512
Aunt March is very ill,
so Laurie will accompany them.

1582
01:41:22,749 --> 01:41:24,685
- That's good of him.
- Mm.

1583
01:41:29,656 --> 01:41:31,692
- What is it?
- I don't know.

1584
01:41:31,825 --> 01:41:34,527
I've always been quite
content with my family.

1585
01:41:37,030 --> 01:41:38,397
Don't understand it.

1586
01:41:40,801 --> 01:41:42,703
Perhaps, um...

1587
01:41:42,836 --> 01:41:45,237
Perhaps I...

1588
01:41:45,371 --> 01:41:48,842
was too quick
in turning him down.

1589
01:41:48,975 --> 01:41:50,077
Laurie.

1590
01:41:52,511 --> 01:41:53,747
Do you love him?

1591
01:41:57,550 --> 01:42:01,520
If he asked me again,
I think I would say yes.

1592
01:42:01,655 --> 01:42:04,223
Do you think
he'll ask me again?

1593
01:42:04,356 --> 01:42:06,059
But do you love him?

1594
01:42:07,861 --> 01:42:09,896
I care more to be loved.

1595
01:42:10,897 --> 01:42:13,133
I want to be loved.

1596
01:42:13,265 --> 01:42:15,568
That is not the same
as loving.

1597
01:42:20,073 --> 01:42:21,141
I know.

1598
01:42:23,710 --> 01:42:26,747
You know, I just...
I just feel...

1599
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:29,883
I just feel like...

1600
01:42:30,016 --> 01:42:31,985
women, they...

1601
01:42:34,087 --> 01:42:36,757
They have minds
and they have souls,

1602
01:42:36,890 --> 01:42:38,457
as well as just hearts.

1603
01:42:38,591 --> 01:42:40,894
And they've got ambition
and they've got talent,

1604
01:42:41,027 --> 01:42:42,294
as well as just beauty.

1605
01:42:42,428 --> 01:42:44,965
And I'm so sick of
people saying

1606
01:42:45,098 --> 01:42:47,601
that love is just
all a woman is fit for.

1607
01:42:47,734 --> 01:42:49,502
I'm so sick of it.

1608
01:42:50,871 --> 01:42:53,907
But I'm... I'm so lonely.

1609
01:43:36,716 --> 01:43:39,953
Couldn't let you travel alone
with Aunt March being so sick.

1610
01:43:41,655 --> 01:43:43,623
Even if you despise me.

1611
01:43:44,991 --> 01:43:46,993
I don't despise you, Laurie.

1612
01:43:54,301 --> 01:43:56,603
Beth was the best of us.

1613
01:44:09,149 --> 01:44:11,151
I'm not marrying Fred.

1614
01:44:14,621 --> 01:44:18,024
- I heard about that.
- And you are under no obligation

1615
01:44:18,158 --> 01:44:21,061
to say anything
or do anything.

1616
01:44:24,331 --> 01:44:26,867
I just didn't love him
as I should.

1617
01:44:28,534 --> 01:44:30,036
We don't need to talk about it.

1618
01:44:30,170 --> 01:44:31,938
We don't need to say anything.

1619
01:44:48,054 --> 01:44:49,956
<i>My dear Teddy,</i>

1620
01:44:50,090 --> 01:44:52,926
<i>I miss you more
than I can express.</i>

1621
01:44:53,059 --> 01:44:57,364
<i>I used to think that the
worst fate was to be a wife.</i>

1622
01:44:57,529 --> 01:44:59,565
<i>I was young and stupid.</i>

1623
01:45:00,867 --> 01:45:02,702
<i>But now I have changed.</i>

1624
01:45:02,836 --> 01:45:07,140
<i>The worst fate is to live
my life without you in it.</i>

1625
01:45:07,274 --> 01:45:11,344
<i>I was wrong to turn you down
and to run away to New York.</i>

1626
01:45:17,017 --> 01:45:18,218
Oysters!

1627
01:45:23,023 --> 01:45:24,791
Lobsters!

1628
01:45:36,736 --> 01:45:38,638
<i>Jo.</i>

1629
01:45:38,772 --> 01:45:40,572
<i>Jo. Jo.</i>

1630
01:45:42,175 --> 01:45:43,209
Jo.

1631
01:45:44,277 --> 01:45:45,879
Wake up.

1632
01:45:46,012 --> 01:45:47,247
Wake up.

1633
01:45:50,549 --> 01:45:55,322
- Teddy! Oh, you're back.
- Are you glad to see me, then?

1634
01:45:55,454 --> 01:45:57,057
Yes.

1635
01:45:57,190 --> 01:45:59,558
Oh, I was worried.

1636
01:45:59,693 --> 01:46:01,394
Mm. Here, come sit.

1637
01:46:07,566 --> 01:46:08,902
How's Amy?
Did she bother you

1638
01:46:09,035 --> 01:46:10,971
all the way from Europe
with her preening?

1639
01:46:11,104 --> 01:46:13,173
Yes, but I like that.

1640
01:46:13,306 --> 01:46:15,942
- Where is she now?
- Your mother has her at Meg's.

1641
01:46:16,076 --> 01:46:17,476
- We stopped on the way.
- Oh.

1642
01:46:17,610 --> 01:46:20,313
There was no getting my wife
out of their clutches.

1643
01:46:22,115 --> 01:46:23,482
Your what?

1644
01:46:23,616 --> 01:46:25,785
I've done it now.

1645
01:46:25,919 --> 01:46:27,687
It was meant to be
a surprise.

1646
01:46:27,821 --> 01:46:29,789
We were engaged
and were hoping to wait,

1647
01:46:29,923 --> 01:46:32,993
but that is to say that
now we are man and wife.

1648
01:46:35,929 --> 01:46:37,297
You and Amy?

1649
01:46:37,430 --> 01:46:38,530
Yes.

1650
01:46:50,043 --> 01:46:51,378
Are you in love?

1651
01:46:51,510 --> 01:46:52,578
Yes.

1652
01:46:56,016 --> 01:46:58,517
I want to say one thing
and then put it away forever.

1653
01:46:58,651 --> 01:47:00,820
I've always loved you.

1654
01:47:00,954 --> 01:47:03,256
But the love I feel for Amy,
it's different.

1655
01:47:03,390 --> 01:47:05,058
And I think...

1656
01:47:05,191 --> 01:47:06,426
you were right about this.

1657
01:47:06,558 --> 01:47:08,862
I think we would've killed
each other.

1658
01:47:10,730 --> 01:47:12,232
Yes.

1659
01:47:12,365 --> 01:47:14,267
I think it was meant this way.

1660
01:47:16,002 --> 01:47:17,670
Oh, Teddy.

1661
01:47:17,804 --> 01:47:20,707
You're the only one that ever
calls me that, Jo. "Teddy."

1662
01:47:22,208 --> 01:47:23,743
What does Amy call you?

1663
01:47:23,877 --> 01:47:25,845
"My lord."

1664
01:47:25,979 --> 01:47:27,814
That sounds like her.

1665
01:47:31,885 --> 01:47:33,820
Well, you look
deserving of it.

1666
01:47:36,555 --> 01:47:38,324
Could we still
be friends, Jo, please?

1667
01:47:42,295 --> 01:47:44,998
Of course, my boy. Always.

1668
01:47:55,975 --> 01:47:58,044
She's a painter.

1669
01:47:58,178 --> 01:47:59,612
Are you excited?

1670
01:48:10,090 --> 01:48:12,591
- Laurie told you?
- Yes, yes.

1671
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:16,096
Amy, I'm so happy for you.

1672
01:48:16,229 --> 01:48:18,431
This... This was meant to be.

1673
01:48:18,565 --> 01:48:20,467
Oh, I'm so relieved.
Thank you.

1674
01:48:20,599 --> 01:48:22,469
I wanted to write, Jo.
I wanted to write.

1675
01:48:22,602 --> 01:48:25,305
I wanted to explain, but
everything was happening so fast

1676
01:48:25,438 --> 01:48:27,407
and I was worried
you'd be angry at me.

1677
01:48:27,540 --> 01:48:30,310
- No. No.
- No, you're not angry at me?

1678
01:48:32,112 --> 01:48:34,447
Life is too short
to be angry at one's sisters.

1679
01:48:40,653 --> 01:48:43,289
- I really miss her.
- I know.

1680
01:48:47,160 --> 01:48:48,461
Thank you.

1681
01:49:47,120 --> 01:49:48,521
Mr. Laurence.

1682
01:49:51,291 --> 01:49:53,359
Jo. Heh.

1683
01:49:54,327 --> 01:49:55,862
Oh, Jo.

1684
01:49:58,198 --> 01:50:01,467
I couldn't bring
myself to, uh...

1685
01:50:05,471 --> 01:50:09,342
The house doesn't seem right
without her, and...

1686
01:50:11,010 --> 01:50:13,413
Couldn't go in,
knowing she wouldn't be there.

1687
01:50:20,887 --> 01:50:23,790
I know I'm not half
so good as my sister,

1688
01:50:23,923 --> 01:50:27,794
but you know I'll be a friend
to lean on, if you'll let me.

1689
01:50:35,168 --> 01:50:36,369
All right.

1690
01:54:02,008 --> 01:54:03,811
<i>Dear Mr. Dashwood,</i>

1691
01:54:03,943 --> 01:54:05,813
enclosed are
the first few chapters

1692
01:54:05,945 --> 01:54:08,314
of a piece
I've only begun working on.

1693
01:54:08,448 --> 01:54:10,450
It could suit as a story
for young people,

1694
01:54:10,583 --> 01:54:12,820
but I think it is
probably quite boring.

1695
01:54:12,952 --> 01:54:14,954
<i>However, I'm sending it to you
just in case</i>

1696
01:54:15,087 --> 01:54:17,256
<i>it has something of value,
though I doubt it.</i>

1697
01:54:17,390 --> 01:54:18,659
<i>Jo March.</i>

1698
01:54:37,911 --> 01:54:39,613
I thought she hated me.

1699
01:54:39,746 --> 01:54:42,114
She could still hate you
and leave you the house.

1700
01:54:42,248 --> 01:54:43,983
What about you and John?

1701
01:54:44,116 --> 01:54:47,320
We can't manage a grand house
like this. It's too big.

1702
01:54:55,762 --> 01:54:58,231
I should sell it,
but I'd love to do something

1703
01:54:58,364 --> 01:55:00,834
that would really make
Aunt March turn in her grave.

1704
01:55:00,968 --> 01:55:02,903
- I wouldn't mind that.
- A nice turning.

1705
01:55:03,035 --> 01:55:04,872
Just a rotation,
nothing terrible.

1706
01:55:05,004 --> 01:55:06,506
What will you do?

1707
01:55:08,508 --> 01:55:10,409
I'd like to open a school.

1708
01:55:10,543 --> 01:55:11,879
We never had
a proper school.

1709
01:55:12,011 --> 01:55:13,814
Now there are
women's colleges opening.

1710
01:55:13,947 --> 01:55:15,816
There should be a school.
For Daisy.

1711
01:55:15,949 --> 01:55:17,183
And what will Demi do?

1712
01:55:17,316 --> 01:55:20,219
I'll open a school
for boys and girls both.

1713
01:55:20,353 --> 01:55:22,588
What about writing?

1714
01:55:22,723 --> 01:55:25,157
- What about it?
- What are you working on?

1715
01:55:25,291 --> 01:55:28,361
I started something, but
I don't think it's very good.

1716
01:55:28,494 --> 01:55:31,397
- Everyone likes what you write.
- No, they don't.

1717
01:55:31,531 --> 01:55:33,000
I do.

1718
01:55:33,132 --> 01:55:35,234
Well, it's just
about our little life.

1719
01:55:35,368 --> 01:55:36,637
So?

1720
01:55:36,770 --> 01:55:39,071
Well, who will be interested
in a story

1721
01:55:39,205 --> 01:55:41,040
of domestic struggles
and joys?

1722
01:55:41,173 --> 01:55:42,976
It doesn't have
any real importance.

1723
01:55:43,109 --> 01:55:44,544
Maybe it doesn't
seem important

1724
01:55:44,678 --> 01:55:46,412
because people
don't write about them.

1725
01:55:46,546 --> 01:55:51,183
No, writing doesn't confer
importance. It reflects it.

1726
01:55:51,317 --> 01:55:53,085
I don't think so.

1727
01:55:53,219 --> 01:55:55,521
Writing them will
make them more important.

1728
01:55:57,156 --> 01:56:00,059
- When did you become so wise?
- Hm-mm. I always have been.

1729
01:56:00,192 --> 01:56:02,161
You were just too busy
noticing my faults.

1730
01:56:02,295 --> 01:56:04,063
Which were never
there, of course.

1731
01:56:20,647 --> 01:56:22,049
<i>Dear Miss March,</i>

1732
01:56:22,181 --> 01:56:24,017
<i>I read the chapters you sent</i>

1733
01:56:24,150 --> 01:56:26,787
and I have to agree,
they aren't very promising.

1734
01:56:26,920 --> 01:56:28,956
<i>But, please,
send more stories</i>

1735
01:56:29,088 --> 01:56:31,557
<i>of the scandalous variety,
if you have any.</i>

1736
01:56:31,692 --> 01:56:35,227
Or, shall I say,
your friend can.

1737
01:56:35,361 --> 01:56:37,664
My apologies for the joke.

1738
01:56:37,798 --> 01:56:39,332
I couldn't help it.

1739
01:56:39,465 --> 01:56:41,802
Jo, come down!

1740
01:56:41,935 --> 01:56:43,070
Coming!

1741
01:56:45,571 --> 01:56:46,907
I'm starving.

1742
01:56:48,709 --> 01:56:50,978
Oh, uh, Jo,
you might wanna wait because...

1743
01:56:51,110 --> 01:56:52,244
I'm famished.

1744
01:56:52,378 --> 01:56:54,313
But, Jo, dear,
you have a guest.

1745
01:56:54,447 --> 01:56:56,016
Mm. I don't know anyone.

1746
01:56:56,148 --> 01:56:58,986
I'm sorry to intrude,
but...

1747
01:57:00,921 --> 01:57:02,121
It's you.

1748
01:57:11,798 --> 01:57:12,833
Oh, uh...

1749
01:57:15,736 --> 01:57:17,470
Hello.

1750
01:57:17,604 --> 01:57:19,673
Hello.
I'm Josephine March.

1751
01:57:19,806 --> 01:57:21,474
- I'm Jo.
- Josephine, is that you?

1752
01:57:21,608 --> 01:57:25,211
Welcome! Welcome.
This is Kitty and Minnie.

1753
01:57:25,344 --> 01:57:28,347
And I see that you have
already met our professor.

1754
01:57:28,481 --> 01:57:30,684
And he's
a very accomplished man.

1755
01:57:30,817 --> 01:57:32,853
And your mother says
that you are a writer.

1756
01:57:32,986 --> 01:57:34,520
I keep a diary, you know.

1757
01:57:34,655 --> 01:57:36,657
We have a lot of
interesting people here,

1758
01:57:36,790 --> 01:57:39,092
intellectuals
and Europeans...

1759
01:57:39,225 --> 01:57:42,629
Jo, I hope it is all right. I
got your address from Ms. Kirke.

1760
01:57:42,763 --> 01:57:45,766
- Who's this? Who are you?
- I'm sorry to intrude.

1761
01:57:45,899 --> 01:57:48,835
I was close by,
and I thought I'd...

1762
01:57:48,969 --> 01:57:50,704
- But I'll be going.
- No, no.

1763
01:57:50,837 --> 01:57:52,839
Please stay.
We have more than enough room.

1764
01:57:52,973 --> 01:57:54,675
- Can someone tell me who this is?
- Shh.

1765
01:57:54,808 --> 01:57:56,109
I don't want to be a burden.

1766
01:57:56,242 --> 01:57:57,510
You're not a burden
at all.

1767
01:57:57,644 --> 01:58:00,047
- Yes, of course. Please.
- I'm Laurie. Who are you?

1768
01:58:00,179 --> 01:58:01,514
I'm Friedrich Bhaer.

1769
01:58:01,648 --> 01:58:04,051
We were at the same
boardinghouse in New York.

1770
01:58:04,183 --> 01:58:07,054
Oh, Jo,
he's very handsome.

1771
01:58:16,362 --> 01:58:18,165
Do you intend
to stay in New York?

1772
01:58:18,297 --> 01:58:22,501
No. I've been offered
a professorship in California.

1773
01:58:22,636 --> 01:58:26,539
And, as I have
nothing keeping me here,

1774
01:58:26,673 --> 01:58:29,142
I thought
I might go west.

1775
01:58:29,275 --> 01:58:30,911
It is new there,
and they are

1776
01:58:31,044 --> 01:58:33,312
less particular
about immigrants.

1777
01:58:33,446 --> 01:58:35,514
Perhaps I should go west.

1778
01:58:35,649 --> 01:58:39,019
You're not an immigrant,
so perhaps you should stay home.

1779
01:58:42,656 --> 01:58:43,924
I'm going!

1780
01:58:53,066 --> 01:58:55,301
- Jo!
- Joseph, not Josephine.

1781
01:58:55,434 --> 01:58:57,137
I know Joseph.
Pretty well, actually.

1782
01:58:57,269 --> 01:58:59,873
Oh, wow!

1783
01:59:00,006 --> 01:59:02,709
This is a beautiful
instrument.

1784
01:59:02,843 --> 01:59:04,211
Which one of you plays?

1785
01:59:04,343 --> 01:59:06,646
Oh, it was
my sister Beth.

1786
01:59:06,780 --> 01:59:08,782
We all play a little, but...

1787
01:59:08,915 --> 01:59:10,583
But none
so well as her.

1788
01:59:10,717 --> 01:59:13,787
It is very hard to lose
a sister.

1789
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:15,088
I'm sorry.

1790
01:59:16,923 --> 01:59:19,726
- Do you play?
- Yes. I do.

1791
01:59:19,860 --> 01:59:22,394
It would make us so happy
if you'd play now.

1792
01:59:22,528 --> 01:59:24,798
She wouldn't want
the piano to sit silent.

1793
01:59:26,199 --> 01:59:27,601
I don't wish to offend.

1794
01:59:27,734 --> 01:59:29,268
Not in the least.

1795
01:59:57,030 --> 02:00:00,233
- It was so lovely to meet you.
- Lovely to meet you. Goodbye.

1796
02:00:00,366 --> 02:00:01,968
It was a real pleasure,
Mr. Bhaer.

1797
02:00:02,102 --> 02:00:04,503
- Bye, Laurie.
- Goodbye.

1798
02:00:06,239 --> 02:00:08,608
- Thank you for everything.
- Lovely to have you.

1799
02:00:08,742 --> 02:00:14,014
If you ever come to California,
I would love to see you.

1800
02:00:15,615 --> 02:00:18,118
I don't know that I will,
but thank you.

1801
02:00:22,222 --> 02:00:24,825
Well, goodbye.

1802
02:00:27,127 --> 02:00:28,028
Goodbye.

1803
02:00:42,943 --> 02:00:44,443
What?

1804
02:00:44,577 --> 02:00:46,378
Why are you all
looking at me like that?

1805
02:00:46,512 --> 02:00:48,748
What a wonderful man.
I hope he comes back.

1806
02:00:48,882 --> 02:00:50,684
He would make
a terrific friend for me.

1807
02:00:50,817 --> 02:00:53,253
- Father, he wasn't here for you!
- No?

1808
02:00:53,385 --> 02:00:56,656
- Jo, you love him.
- What? No, no, I don't.

1809
02:00:56,790 --> 02:00:59,059
Yes, you do! I am half
as smart as you,

1810
02:00:59,192 --> 02:01:01,560
but I can see it
so plainly. You love him.

1811
02:01:01,695 --> 02:01:03,830
- Doesn't she?
- Good instinct. You love him.

1812
02:01:03,964 --> 02:01:06,900
I have never seen you so happy.
What else is love?

1813
02:01:07,033 --> 02:01:09,202
You need to go after him.
Prepare the horses.

1814
02:01:09,336 --> 02:01:11,238
- We can catch him.
- I'm coming too.

1815
02:01:11,370 --> 02:01:13,340
- No, I'm not going.
- Yes, you are.

1816
02:01:13,472 --> 02:01:14,674
- Amy is right.
- Exactly!

1817
02:01:14,808 --> 02:01:16,442
Never thought
I'd prepare a carriage

1818
02:01:16,575 --> 02:01:18,377
to help Jo March chase a man,
but I like it.

1819
02:01:18,510 --> 02:01:20,546
- He's moving to California.
- That was fiction!

1820
02:01:20,680 --> 02:01:22,916
He was practically begging
for a reason to stay.

1821
02:01:23,049 --> 02:01:25,185
- But it's raining outside.
- That doesn't matter.

1822
02:01:25,318 --> 02:01:27,386
- Come with me. I need to fix you.
- Jo!

1823
02:01:27,519 --> 02:01:29,222
Laurie, will you
stop standing there

1824
02:01:29,356 --> 02:01:31,291
and go get the horses ready?
Thank you.

1825
02:01:38,265 --> 02:01:40,367
You never ask about my mother,

1826
02:01:40,499 --> 02:01:42,702
even when you know
I've seen her.

1827
02:01:42,836 --> 02:01:44,871
I assume
she's still alive.

1828
02:01:45,005 --> 02:01:46,640
But I ask
after your mother.

1829
02:01:46,773 --> 02:01:48,775
And I have no idea why.

1830
02:01:48,909 --> 02:01:50,576
You're willfully
missing the point.

1831
02:01:50,710 --> 02:01:51,577
That's true.

1832
02:01:52,746 --> 02:01:54,047
What do they want?

1833
02:01:54,180 --> 02:01:55,447
I have no idea.

1834
02:01:55,581 --> 02:01:56,917
Are you publishing this?

1835
02:01:57,050 --> 02:01:58,685
What happens
to the "little women"?

1836
02:01:58,818 --> 02:02:01,388
Tell me you have
the rest of this book.

1837
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:02,856
What?

1838
02:02:16,670 --> 02:02:18,772
I'm just trying
to fix this hair.

1839
02:02:23,442 --> 02:02:25,278
Stop, stop, stop.
Stop the carriage.

1840
02:02:25,412 --> 02:02:26,980
- Stop!
- Stop the carriage!

1841
02:02:27,113 --> 02:02:29,916
Stop. All right, Go. Out. Out.
Go. Go, go, go.

1842
02:02:30,050 --> 02:02:31,217
- Go!
- Jo, your hair!

1843
02:02:31,351 --> 02:02:33,320
Kiss him with love!

1844
02:02:41,962 --> 02:02:45,632
Frankly, I don't see why
she didn't marry the neighbor.

1845
02:02:45,765 --> 02:02:47,968
Well, because the neighbor
marries her sister.

1846
02:02:49,369 --> 02:02:52,005
Right, right.
Of course.

1847
02:02:54,007 --> 02:02:55,675
So who does she marry?

1848
02:02:55,809 --> 02:02:58,178
No one. She doesn't marry
either of them.

1849
02:02:59,279 --> 02:03:01,381
No.

1850
02:03:01,513 --> 02:03:03,883
No! No, no,
that won't work at all.

1851
02:03:04,017 --> 02:03:06,353
She says the whole book
she doesn't want to marry.

1852
02:03:06,485 --> 02:03:07,954
Who cares?

1853
02:03:08,088 --> 02:03:10,323
Girls want to see women married,
not consistent.

1854
02:03:10,457 --> 02:03:12,125
No, it isn't
the right ending.

1855
02:03:12,258 --> 02:03:14,361
The right ending
is the one that sells.

1856
02:03:15,695 --> 02:03:17,364
Trust me. If you decide

1857
02:03:17,496 --> 02:03:19,032
to end your delightful book

1858
02:03:19,165 --> 02:03:20,800
with your heroine a spinster,

1859
02:03:20,934 --> 02:03:22,534
no one will buy it.

1860
02:03:22,669 --> 02:03:25,504
It won't be worth printing.

1861
02:03:25,638 --> 02:03:27,207
I suppose marriage
has always been

1862
02:03:27,340 --> 02:03:29,642
an economic proposition,
even in fiction.

1863
02:03:29,776 --> 02:03:32,511
- It's romance.
- Heh, heh, it's mercenary.

1864
02:03:32,645 --> 02:03:36,249
- Just end it that way, will you?
- Heh, fine.

1865
02:03:36,383 --> 02:03:37,650
- Go!
- Jo, your hair!

1866
02:03:37,784 --> 02:03:39,419
Kiss him with love!
Go!

1867
02:03:42,222 --> 02:03:45,058
- You look so beautiful!
- Go, Jo!

1868
02:04:03,777 --> 02:04:04,677
Jo!

1869
02:04:12,719 --> 02:04:15,422
I... I don't want you to leave.
I want you to stay.

1870
02:04:15,554 --> 02:04:16,856
- You do?
- Yes.

1871
02:04:16,990 --> 02:04:18,992
I would never leave
if you wish me to stay.

1872
02:04:19,125 --> 02:04:21,528
- No, I want you to stay.
- I have nothing to give you.

1873
02:04:21,661 --> 02:04:23,063
It doesn't matter.

1874
02:04:23,196 --> 02:04:24,563
My hands are empty.

1875
02:04:24,697 --> 02:04:25,832
They're not empty.

1876
02:04:33,807 --> 02:04:36,709
<i>I love it. It's romantic.</i>

1877
02:04:36,843 --> 02:04:40,380
It's very moving.
That's very emotional.

1878
02:04:40,513 --> 02:04:43,283
- Well, thank you.
- We could call the chapter...

1879
02:04:44,851 --> 02:04:46,386
"Under the Umbrella."

1880
02:04:46,519 --> 02:04:47,921
- That's good.
- Perfect.

1881
02:04:48,054 --> 02:04:50,023
Now, there's the question
of the contract.

1882
02:04:50,156 --> 02:04:52,591
I'm prepared to give you
5 percent of the royalties.

1883
02:04:52,725 --> 02:04:54,394
So I get 5 percent
of the profit.

1884
02:04:54,527 --> 02:04:57,764
Five percent of the net profits,
after I recoup.

1885
02:04:57,897 --> 02:05:00,599
Huh. Well, what about
a payment up front?

1886
02:05:00,733 --> 02:05:03,436
I'm the one taking the risk
in printing this book.

1887
02:05:03,570 --> 02:05:05,605
Yes, but it's my book.

1888
02:05:05,738 --> 02:05:07,774
And if it does well,
we'll both make money.

1889
02:05:07,907 --> 02:05:09,676
If not,
I can stay in business.

1890
02:05:09,809 --> 02:05:11,444
Oh, so I get nothing
if it fails.

1891
02:05:11,578 --> 02:05:15,482
No, I'll give you $500 right now
to buy out the copyright.

1892
02:05:15,615 --> 02:05:17,817
- The copyright?
- That's the right for reprinting,

1893
02:05:17,951 --> 02:05:20,753
that sort of thing. Sequels,
characters for other stories.

1894
02:05:20,887 --> 02:05:22,255
Might that
be worth something?

1895
02:05:22,388 --> 02:05:24,791
Well, only if it's a success.

1896
02:05:24,924 --> 02:05:28,261
I see. It seems like something
I would want to own, no?

1897
02:05:28,394 --> 02:05:31,197
Didn't you say your family
needed the money immediately?

1898
02:05:31,331 --> 02:05:33,867
Yes, they do, which is why
I wanted up-front payment.

1899
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:38,104
No. It's too risky. I'll only
pay for the copyright.

1900
02:05:45,078 --> 02:05:48,114
You keep your $500,
and I'll keep the copyright.

1901
02:05:49,749 --> 02:05:52,152
Also, I want 10 percent
of royalties.

1902
02:05:54,020 --> 02:05:57,657
Five point five percent.
That's very generous.

1903
02:05:57,790 --> 02:06:00,793
- Nine percent.
- Six percent, and that's it.

1904
02:06:02,395 --> 02:06:04,597
Mr. Dashwood, if I'm going
to sell my heroine

1905
02:06:04,731 --> 02:06:08,434
into marriage for money,
I might as well get some of it.

1906
02:06:08,568 --> 02:06:10,170
Six point six percent.

1907
02:06:11,838 --> 02:06:14,040
- Done.
- And you don't need to decide

1908
02:06:14,174 --> 02:06:16,676
- about the copyright right now.
- No, I've decided.

1909
02:06:16,809 --> 02:06:18,612
I want to own my own book.

1910
02:06:25,685 --> 02:06:27,954
Where is she?
She's here, everyone!

1911
02:06:33,993 --> 02:06:35,328
Come on!

1912
02:06:43,469 --> 02:06:46,372
Now, see if you can make a B.

1913
02:09:52,492 --> 02:09:57,492
