1
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,815
I was sheriff of this county when I was
twenty-five years old.

2
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:43,413
Hard to believe.

3
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,111
Grandfather was a lawman.
Father too.

4
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,767
Me and him was sheriff at the same time,
him up in Plano and me out here.

5
00:00:54,034 --> 00:00:55,340
I think he was pretty proud of that.

6
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:57,747
I know I was.

7
00:00:59,656 --> 00:01:02,356
Some of the old-time sheriffs
never even wore a gun.

8
00:01:03,287 --> 00:01:05,311
A lot of folks find that
hard to believe.

9
00:01:05,312 --> 00:01:06,945
Jim Scarborough never carried one.

10
00:01:06,946 --> 00:01:08,010
That the younger Jim.

11
00:01:08,712 --> 00:01:11,585
Gaston Boykins wouldn't wear one
up in Commanche County.

12
00:01:13,467 --> 00:01:15,719
Now I always liked to hear about
the old-timers.

13
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:18,731
Never missed a chance to do so.

14
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:23,135
You can't help but compare yourself
against the old-timers.

15
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,000
Can't help but wonder how they
would've operated these times.

16
00:01:28,446 --> 00:01:32,202
There is this boy I sent to the electric
chair in Huntsville here a while back.

17
00:01:33,683 --> 00:01:36,129
My arrest and my testimony.

18
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,044
He killed a fourteen-year-old girl.

19
00:01:41,397 --> 00:01:46,387
Papers said it was a crime of passion but
he told me there wasn't any passion to it.

20
00:01:47,057 --> 00:01:51,309
Told me that he'd been planning to kill somebody
for about as long as he could remember.

21
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,367
Said if they turned him out he'd do it again.

22
00:01:54,175 --> 00:01:55,383
Said he knew he was going to hell.

23
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:58,401
Be there in about fifteen minutes.

24
00:01:59,444 --> 00:02:00,643
I don't know what to make of that.

25
00:02:02,036 --> 00:02:03,536
I surely don't.

26
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:08,357
The crime you see now, it's hard
to even take its measure.

27
00:02:10,604 --> 00:02:12,210
It's not that I'm afraid of it.

28
00:02:14,172 --> 00:02:17,772
I always knew you had to be willing
to die to even do this job.

29
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,634
But I don't want to push my chips forward...

30
00:02:22,444 --> 00:02:25,977
...and go out and meet something
I don't understand.

31
00:02:30,313 --> 00:02:32,775
A man would have to put his soul at hazard.

32
00:02:34,505 --> 00:02:36,466
He just have to say, okay.

33
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,415
I'll be part of this world.

34
00:02:44,738 --> 00:02:46,528
Yessir, I just walked in the door.

35
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,315
Sheriff he had some sort of
thing on him like a...

36
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,006
...oxygen tanks for emphysema or something.

37
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,701
And a hose that run down his sleeve...

38
00:02:58,781 --> 00:02:59,515
You got me.

39
00:02:59,516 --> 00:03:01,416
You'll look at it when you get in.

40
00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:04,131
Yessir, I got it under control.

41
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,339
Howdy, what's this about?

42
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,818
Step out of the car please, sir.

43
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:47,143
What is it?

44
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,852
I need you to step out of the car, sir.

45
00:04:57,686 --> 00:04:58,906
What is that for?

46
00:05:00,215 --> 00:05:02,774
Would you hold still please, sir.

47
00:05:32,886 --> 00:05:33,812
Hold still.

48
00:09:15,206 --> 00:09:16,327
Agua.

49
00:09:18,742 --> 00:09:19,921
...Agua. Por Dios.

50
00:09:32,457 --> 00:09:33,427
Agua.

51
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:37,713
I ain't got no water.

52
00:09:50,295 --> 00:09:51,268
Agua.

53
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:54,797
I ain't got no agua.

54
00:10:10,184 --> 00:10:11,036
You speak English?

55
00:10:13,545 --> 00:10:14,880
Where's the last guy?

56
00:10:16,094 --> 00:10:17,033
Ultimo hombre.

57
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:18,867
Last man standing.
There must've been one.

58
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:19,592
Where'd he go?

59
00:10:26,589 --> 00:10:28,725
I reckon I'd go out the way I came in.

60
00:10:29,915 --> 00:10:30,843
La puerta...

61
00:10:32,895 --> 00:10:33,877
Hay lobos...

62
00:10:35,502 --> 00:10:36,682
Ain't no lobos.

63
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:58,126
If you stopped and watch your backtrack,
you're gonna shoot my dumb ass.

64
00:11:01,514 --> 00:11:06,175
But if you stopped, you
stopped in the shade.

65
00:14:27,058 --> 00:14:28,897
What's in the satchel?

66
00:14:28,898 --> 00:14:29,955
It's full of money.

67
00:14:31,011 --> 00:14:32,107
That'll be the day.

68
00:14:33,585 --> 00:14:34,691
Where'd you get the pistol?

69
00:14:34,692 --> 00:14:36,027
At the gettin' place.

70
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,526
Did you buy that gun?

71
00:14:38,727 --> 00:14:40,280
No. I found it.

72
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,769
Welyn!

73
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:44,209
What?

74
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,295
Quit your hollering.

75
00:14:46,381 --> 00:14:47,855
What'd you give for that thing?

76
00:14:49,878 --> 00:14:51,735
You don't need to know everything, Carla Jean.

77
00:14:52,805 --> 00:14:54,149
I need to know that.

78
00:14:54,712 --> 00:14:58,308
You keep running that mouth of yours I'm gonna
take you in the back and screw you.

79
00:14:59,218 --> 00:15:00,281
Big talk.

80
00:15:00,676 --> 00:15:01,584
Keep it up.

81
00:15:02,261 --> 00:15:04,551
Fine. I don't wanna know.

82
00:15:05,703 --> 00:15:07,376
I don't even wanna know
where you been all day.

83
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,592
That'll work.

84
00:15:25,378 --> 00:15:25,937
Alright.

85
00:15:32,664 --> 00:15:33,768
Llewelyn.

86
00:15:34,352 --> 00:15:35,148
Yeah?

87
00:15:37,577 --> 00:15:38,767
What're you doing, baby?

88
00:15:40,227 --> 00:15:40,877
I'm going out.

89
00:15:40,978 --> 00:15:42,029
Going where?

90
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,268
Something I forgot to do but I'll be back.

91
00:15:46,476 --> 00:15:47,528
What're you going to do?

92
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:51,205
I'm fixing to do something dumber
now but I'm going anyways.

93
00:15:53,821 --> 00:15:56,049
If I don't come back tell Mother I love her.

94
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,229
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.

95
00:16:03,604 --> 00:16:05,017
Well then. I'll tell her myself.

96
00:20:59,173 --> 00:20:59,997
How much?

97
00:21:00,198 --> 00:21:01,689
Sixty-nine cents.

98
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,283
And the gas.

99
00:21:04,184 --> 00:21:06,241
Y'all getting any rain up your way?

100
00:21:07,886 --> 00:21:08,887
What way would that be?

101
00:21:08,988 --> 00:21:10,626
I seen you was from Dallas.

102
00:21:13,135 --> 00:21:18,735
What business is it of yours
where I'm from, friendo?

103
00:21:21,486 --> 00:21:22,867
I didn't mean nothing by it.

104
00:21:23,068 --> 00:21:24,406
Didn't mean nothing.

105
00:21:24,607 --> 00:21:26,867
Just passing my time.

106
00:21:29,256 --> 00:21:32,540
If you don't wanna accept that I don't
know what else I can do for you.

107
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,967
Will there be something else?

108
00:21:36,968 --> 00:21:38,470
I don't know. Will there?

109
00:21:45,696 --> 00:21:46,718
Is somethin wrong?

110
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:47,495
With what?

111
00:21:47,496 --> 00:21:48,238
With anything?

112
00:21:50,033 --> 00:21:51,288
Is that what you're asking me?

113
00:21:52,134 --> 00:21:53,825
Is there something wrong with anything?

114
00:21:54,702 --> 00:21:55,965
Will there be anything else?

115
00:21:55,965 --> 00:21:56,891
You already asked me that.

116
00:22:01,163 --> 00:22:03,087
Well... I need to see about closing.

117
00:22:03,529 --> 00:22:04,758
See about closing.

118
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:05,354
Yessir.

119
00:22:05,355 --> 00:22:06,434
What time do you close?

120
00:22:06,435 --> 00:22:08,076
Now. We close now.

121
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:08,863
Now is not a time.

122
00:22:08,864 --> 00:22:10,094
What time do you close?

123
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:11,822
Generally around dark. At dark.

124
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:18,678
You don't know what you're
talking about, do you?

125
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:19,256
Sir?

126
00:22:21,502 --> 00:22:24,281
I said you don't know what you're
talking about.

127
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:28,549
What time do you go to bed?

128
00:22:29,218 --> 00:22:29,736
Sir?

129
00:22:29,936 --> 00:22:31,464
You're a bit deaf, aren't you?

130
00:22:31,465 --> 00:22:33,374
I said what time do you go to bed?

131
00:22:38,003 --> 00:22:39,395
Somewhere around 9:30.

132
00:22:39,996 --> 00:22:41,938
I'd say around 9:30.

133
00:22:41,939 --> 00:22:43,143
I could come back then.

134
00:22:43,144 --> 00:22:44,477
Why would you be coming back?

135
00:22:44,478 --> 00:22:45,478
We'd be closed.

136
00:22:45,479 --> 00:22:46,463
Yeah. You said that.

137
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,507
Well... I got to close now.

138
00:22:50,508 --> 00:22:52,057
You live in that house out back?

139
00:22:53,326 --> 00:22:55,165
Yes I do.

140
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,509
You lived here all your life?

141
00:22:59,022 --> 00:23:02,917
This is my wife's father's place. Originally.

142
00:23:05,743 --> 00:23:06,639
You married into it.

143
00:23:07,358 --> 00:23:09,984
We lived in Temple Texas for many years.

144
00:23:11,463 --> 00:23:12,901
Raised a family there.

145
00:23:13,701 --> 00:23:14,948
In Temple.

146
00:23:14,949 --> 00:23:17,039
We come out here about four years ago.

147
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:18,882
You married into it.

148
00:23:19,688 --> 00:23:21,193
If that's the way you wanna put it.

149
00:23:21,451 --> 00:23:23,156
I don't have some way to put it.

150
00:23:24,274 --> 00:23:25,341
That's the way it is.

151
00:23:33,683 --> 00:23:36,088
What's the most you've ever
lost in a coin toss?

152
00:23:37,437 --> 00:23:37,977
Sir?

153
00:23:37,978 --> 00:23:41,280
The most you ever lost in a coin toss.

154
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:45,033
I don't know. I couldn't say.

155
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:48,993
Call it.

156
00:23:49,766 --> 00:23:50,263
Call it?

157
00:23:50,356 --> 00:23:50,875
Yes.

158
00:23:51,548 --> 00:23:52,223
For what?

159
00:23:52,462 --> 00:23:53,238
Just call it.

160
00:23:56,375 --> 00:24:00,032
Well, we need to know what
we're calling it for here.

161
00:24:00,033 --> 00:24:01,068
You need to call it.

162
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:02,858
I can't call it for you.

163
00:24:03,705 --> 00:24:04,924
It wouldn't be fair.

164
00:24:05,037 --> 00:24:06,613
I didn't put nothing up.

165
00:24:06,614 --> 00:24:07,886
Yes, you did.

166
00:24:08,543 --> 00:24:10,220
You've been putting it up your whole life.

167
00:24:10,221 --> 00:24:11,287
You just didn't know it.

168
00:24:12,563 --> 00:24:14,429
You know what date is on this coin?

169
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:15,704
No.

170
00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:16,635
1958.

171
00:24:17,552 --> 00:24:19,765
It's been traveling twenty-two
years to get here.

172
00:24:20,291 --> 00:24:21,253
And now it's here.

173
00:24:22,389 --> 00:24:23,588
And it's either heads or tails.

174
00:24:25,128 --> 00:24:26,358
And you have to say. Call it.

175
00:24:26,659 --> 00:24:29,738
Look... I need to know what I stand to win.

176
00:24:30,106 --> 00:24:30,860
Everything.

177
00:24:32,226 --> 00:24:32,758
How's that?

178
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:34,928
You stand to win everything. Call it.

179
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:42,825
Alright. Heads then.

180
00:24:47,605 --> 00:24:48,534
Well done.

181
00:24:51,043 --> 00:24:51,855
Don't put it in your pocket.

182
00:24:51,945 --> 00:24:52,878
Sir?

183
00:24:52,879 --> 00:24:54,914
Don't put it in your pocket.
It's your lucky quarter.

184
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:58,240
Where you want me to put it?

185
00:24:58,241 --> 00:24:59,450
Anywhere not in your pocket.

186
00:25:00,678 --> 00:25:03,738
Or it'll be mixed in with the others
and become just a coin.

187
00:25:08,222 --> 00:25:08,775
Which it is.

188
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,630
Llewelyn?

189
00:25:24,746 --> 00:25:25,508
What the hell?

190
00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:28,573
Odessa.

191
00:25:29,156 --> 00:25:30,795
Why would we go to Odessa?

192
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,749
Not we, you. Stay with your mother.

193
00:25:34,586 --> 00:25:35,414
Well, how come?

194
00:25:36,165 --> 00:25:37,840
Right now it's midnight Sunday.

195
00:25:37,841 --> 00:25:40,039
When the courthouse opens nine hours from now,...

196
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,432
...someone's gonna be callin' in the vehicle
number on the inspection plate on the truck.

197
00:25:44,064 --> 00:25:45,902
And by 9:30, they'll show up here.

198
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,932
But for how long do we have to...

199
00:25:47,933 --> 00:25:51,172
Baby, at what point would you quit bothering
to look for your two million dollars?

200
00:25:52,595 --> 00:25:53,973
What am I supposed to tell Mama?

201
00:25:54,943 --> 00:25:57,442
Try standin' in the door and holler
"Mama, I'm home".

202
00:25:57,443 --> 00:25:58,264
Llewelyn...

203
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,185
C'mon, pack your things.

204
00:25:59,186 --> 00:26:01,804
Anything you leave you ain't
gonna see it again.

205
00:26:04,078 --> 00:26:07,549
Well, thanks for falling all over
and apologizing.

206
00:26:08,249 --> 00:26:12,394
Baby, things happened.
I can't take 'em back.

207
00:26:35,823 --> 00:26:36,980
Mind ridin', bitch?

208
00:26:50,586 --> 00:26:51,320
This his truck?

209
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:52,359
Mm-Mm.

210
00:26:56,753 --> 00:26:57,731
Got a screwgie?

211
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,946
Who cut his tires?

212
00:27:02,947 --> 00:27:05,602
Mexicans, I guess. Wasn't us.

213
00:27:07,004 --> 00:27:08,446
That's a dead dog.

214
00:27:08,646 --> 00:27:09,613
Yes, it is.

215
00:27:13,755 --> 00:27:14,729
Where's the receiver?

216
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:15,887
I've got it.

217
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:19,018
They're ripe petunias.

218
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:21,895
Hold this please.

219
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:31,400
You want it?

220
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,068
You getting anything though?

221
00:27:35,851 --> 00:27:36,890
Not a bleep.

222
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:39,022
Alright...

223
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:43,244
Gimme that.

224
00:27:53,721 --> 00:27:55,711
I thought it was a car afire.

225
00:27:55,712 --> 00:27:56,714
It is a car afire.

226
00:27:56,715 --> 00:27:58,994
But Wnedell said there was
something backcountry too.

227
00:28:01,464 --> 00:28:04,289
When is the county gonna start
paying a rental on my horse?

228
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,800
I love you more and more everyday.

229
00:28:06,063 --> 00:28:07,203
That's very nice.

230
00:28:08,876 --> 00:28:09,543
Be careful.

231
00:28:09,544 --> 00:28:10,036
Always am.

232
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:11,234
Don't get hurt.

233
00:28:11,235 --> 00:28:12,038
Never do.

234
00:28:12,271 --> 00:28:13,388
Don't hurt no one.

235
00:28:16,547 --> 00:28:17,484
If you say so.

236
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:55,145
Wouldn't think a car would burn like that.

237
00:28:55,249 --> 00:28:58,701
Yessir. We should've brought weenies.

238
00:28:58,702 --> 00:29:01,300
That look like about a '77 Ford to you, Wendell?

239
00:29:01,665 --> 00:29:02,717
It could be.

240
00:29:02,718 --> 00:29:04,771
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.

241
00:29:05,027 --> 00:29:06,664
The old boy shot by the highway?

242
00:29:06,665 --> 00:29:09,010
Yessir, his vehicle.

243
00:29:10,113 --> 00:29:12,679
Man killed Lamar's deputy and took his car.

244
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,130
Killed that man on the highway,...

245
00:29:14,131 --> 00:29:15,490
...swapped for his car...

246
00:29:15,491 --> 00:29:18,914
...and now here it is and he's swapped
again for god knows what.

247
00:29:19,942 --> 00:29:22,907
That's very linear, Sheriff.

248
00:29:23,242 --> 00:29:24,960
Well. Old age flattens a man.

249
00:29:24,961 --> 00:29:28,626
Yessir. But then there's this other.

250
00:29:30,655 --> 00:29:32,263
You ride Winston.

251
00:29:32,496 --> 00:29:34,543
- You sure?
- Oh, I'm more than sure.

252
00:29:35,437 --> 00:29:37,233
Anything happens to Loretta's horse out here,...

253
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:40,198
...I can tell you right now I don't wanna be
the party that was aboard.

254
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:44,299
It's the same tire tread comin back as going.

255
00:29:44,373 --> 00:29:47,682
Made about the same time too.
You can see the sipes real clear.

256
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:52,958
Somebodies pried the inspection
plate off the door on this one.

257
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,413
I know this truck.

258
00:29:57,743 --> 00:29:59,874
Belongs to a fella named Moss.

259
00:30:00,234 --> 00:30:02,539
- Llewelyn Moss?
- That's the boy.

260
00:30:03,194 --> 00:30:04,669
You figure him for a doperunner?

261
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:08,648
I don't know but I kindly doubt it.

262
00:30:08,803 --> 00:30:10,910
Restul sunt acolo.

263
00:30:13,192 --> 00:30:15,360
Oh hell's bells, they even shot the dog.

264
00:30:19,083 --> 00:30:21,146
Well this is just a deal gone wrong, isn't it?

265
00:30:21,147 --> 00:30:25,065
Yeah, appears to have been a glitch or two.

266
00:30:29,042 --> 00:30:30,847
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?

267
00:30:30,848 --> 00:30:35,310
Nine millimeter. Couple of .45 ACP's.

268
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:40,001
Somebody unloaded on that thing with a shotgun.

269
00:30:42,427 --> 00:30:44,735
How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em?

270
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,580
I don't know.

271
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:54,551
Supposedly coyotes won't eat a Mexican.

272
00:30:54,797 --> 00:30:57,480
These boys appear to be managerial.

273
00:30:57,955 --> 00:31:00,329
I think we're lookin at more than one fracas...

274
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,874
Execution here...

275
00:31:01,881 --> 00:31:03,777
...Wild West over there

276
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:07,075
That Mexican brown dope.

277
00:31:07,076 --> 00:31:09,327
These boys is all swole up.

278
00:31:09,328 --> 00:31:12,294
So this was earlier, getting set to trade.

279
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:14,765
Then, whoa, differences...

280
00:31:15,512 --> 00:31:17,479
You know might not of even been no money.

281
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,964
That's possible.

282
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,807
But you don't believe it.

283
00:31:21,467 --> 00:31:24,349
No. Probably I don't.

284
00:31:27,308 --> 00:31:29,677
Well, it's a mess, ain't it Sheriff?

285
00:31:31,876 --> 00:31:35,262
If it ain't, it'll do till a mess gets here.

286
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:29,498
Yessir?

287
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:32,494
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.

288
00:33:32,881 --> 00:33:34,625
Did you go up to his trailer?

289
00:33:34,998 --> 00:33:35,466
Yes.

290
00:33:36,065 --> 00:33:39,317
Well, I'd say he's at work. Do you
want to leave a message?

291
00:33:39,443 --> 00:33:40,440
Where does he work?

292
00:33:40,958 --> 00:33:42,014
I can't say.

293
00:33:44,682 --> 00:33:45,907
Where does he work?

294
00:33:45,908 --> 00:33:50,349
Sir, I ain't at liberty to give out
no information about our residents.

295
00:33:51,347 --> 00:33:53,188
Where does he work?

296
00:33:53,189 --> 00:33:58,670
Did you not hear me? We can't give
out no information.

297
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,849
Why all the way to Del Rio?

298
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:25,204
I'm gonna borrow a car from Roberto.

299
00:34:25,286 --> 00:34:26,830
You can't afford one?

300
00:34:27,756 --> 00:34:29,309
I don't wanna register it.

301
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:31,087
Look, I'll call you in a couple days.

302
00:34:31,088 --> 00:34:33,175
- Promise?
- Yes, I do.

303
00:34:34,251 --> 00:34:36,189
I got a bad feeling, Llewelyn.

304
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:38,694
Well I got a good one.
So, they ought to even out.

305
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,037
Quit worrying so much.

306
00:34:42,618 --> 00:34:44,046
Mama's gonna raise hell.

307
00:34:44,847 --> 00:34:46,649
She is just gonna curse you
up and down.

308
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:48,639
You should be used to that.

309
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,575
I'm used to lots of things,
I work at Wal-Mart.

310
00:34:51,785 --> 00:34:55,068
Not any more, Carla Jean.
You're retired.

311
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:57,762
- Llewelyn?
- Yes ma'am?

312
00:34:59,458 --> 00:35:04,448
- You are comin back, ain't ya?
- I shall return.

313
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,185
Sheriff's Department!

314
00:35:13,207 --> 00:35:14,800
Look at that lock.

315
00:35:17,601 --> 00:35:18,595
We goin' in?

316
00:35:18,596 --> 00:35:20,372
Gun out and up.

317
00:35:23,894 --> 00:35:27,082
- What about yours?
- I'm hidin behind you.

318
00:35:30,037 --> 00:35:31,820
Sheriff's Department!

319
00:35:58,085 --> 00:35:59,959
I believe they've lit a shuck.

320
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,300
I believe you're right.

321
00:36:01,301 --> 00:36:02,858
That from the lock?

322
00:36:03,158 --> 00:36:04,929
Probably must be.

323
00:36:05,127 --> 00:36:06,549
When was he here, Sheriff?

324
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,291
I don't know.

325
00:36:07,292 --> 00:36:10,468
Oh. Now that's aggravating.

326
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:11,515
Sheriff?

327
00:36:11,516 --> 00:36:13,060
Still sweating.

328
00:36:13,227 --> 00:36:16,856
Oh, Sheriff, we just missed him!

329
00:36:18,249 --> 00:36:20,983
We gotta circulate this. On radio.

330
00:36:21,821 --> 00:36:23,030
Alright.

331
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,124
What do we circulate?

332
00:36:28,454 --> 00:36:31,653
Lookin for a man who has
recently drunk milk?

333
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,484
Ah, Sheriff, that's aggravating.

334
00:36:37,485 --> 00:36:39,649
I'm ahead of you there.

335
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:46,387
You think this boy Moss has got any notion of
the sorts of sons of bitches that are hunting him?

336
00:36:46,388 --> 00:36:48,556
I don't know. He ought to...

337
00:36:51,388 --> 00:36:53,715
He seen the same things I've seen,...

338
00:36:53,716 --> 00:36:56,773
...and it certainly made an impression on me.

339
00:37:02,792 --> 00:37:04,724
- Take me to a motel.
- Got one in mind?

340
00:37:04,725 --> 00:37:06,366
Someplace cheap.

341
00:37:08,384 --> 00:37:10,445
You tell me the option.

342
00:37:10,446 --> 00:37:11,794
Do what now?

343
00:37:11,795 --> 00:37:15,485
You pick the option goes with the applicable rate.

344
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:20,317
I'm just one person. So, don't
matter the size of the bed.

345
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:29,399
<i>This is Roberto Sagramore,
I'm not here right now.</i>

346
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,803
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

347
00:39:30,113 --> 00:39:31,375
Hello?

348
00:39:32,142 --> 00:39:33,874
Is Llewelyn there?

349
00:39:34,132 --> 00:39:36,842
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.

350
00:39:37,757 --> 00:39:39,358
You expect him?

351
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:41,277
Now why would I expect him?

352
00:39:41,659 --> 00:39:43,489
Who's this?

353
00:39:51,503 --> 00:39:52,637
Can I help you?

354
00:39:52,638 --> 00:39:55,849
Yeah. You got a pair of Larry Mahan's,
shoulder size 11.

355
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:57,275
I'll check.

356
00:39:57,296 --> 00:39:59,216
- You sell socks?
- Just white.

357
00:39:59,252 --> 00:40:01,057
White is all I wear.

358
00:40:01,277 --> 00:40:02,836
You got a bathroom?

359
00:40:28,308 --> 00:40:31,853
Don't stop. Just ride me
up past those rooms.

360
00:40:31,947 --> 00:40:35,225
- What room?
- Just drive me around.

361
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,459
I want to see if someone's here.

362
00:40:45,424 --> 00:40:47,095
Keep going. Don't stop.

363
00:40:47,538 --> 00:40:50,398
I don't wanna get into some
kind of a jackpot here, buddy.

364
00:40:50,399 --> 00:40:51,751
It's alright.

365
00:40:52,578 --> 00:40:55,560
Why don't I just set you down around here
and we won't argue about it.

366
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:58,157
Take me to another motel.

367
00:40:58,283 --> 00:40:59,690
Let's just call it square.

368
00:40:59,691 --> 00:41:02,673
Look, you're already in a jackpot.
I'm trying to get you out of it.

369
00:41:02,674 --> 00:41:04,374
Now take me to another motel.

370
00:41:53,953 --> 00:41:56,456
The lab reports from Austin on
that boy by the highway.

371
00:41:56,457 --> 00:41:57,678
What was the bullet?

372
00:41:57,679 --> 00:41:59,092
There wasn't no bullet.

373
00:42:00,203 --> 00:42:01,311
Wasn't no bullet?

374
00:42:01,312 --> 00:42:03,184
Yessir. Wasn't none.

375
00:42:03,733 --> 00:42:08,417
Well, Wendell, with all due respect,
that don't make a lot of sense.

376
00:42:08,789 --> 00:42:10,042
No sir.

377
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,872
You said entry wound in the forehead.

378
00:42:12,873 --> 00:42:14,201
No exit wound.

379
00:42:14,202 --> 00:42:15,075
Yes sir.

380
00:42:15,076 --> 00:42:16,941
Are you telling he shot this boy in the head...

381
00:42:16,942 --> 00:42:19,057
...and then went digging around in
there with a pocket knife?

382
00:42:20,125 --> 00:42:22,104
Sir, I don't want to picture that.

383
00:42:22,105 --> 00:42:23,546
I don't either!

384
00:42:23,547 --> 00:42:25,382
Can I freshen that there for you, Sheriff?

385
00:42:25,702 --> 00:42:27,930
Yeah, Noreen, you better had.

386
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,399
The Rangers and the DEA are headed back
out to the scene this morning.

387
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,648
You gonna join 'em?

388
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,118
Any new bodies accumulated out there?

389
00:42:37,791 --> 00:42:39,042
No sir.

390
00:42:39,133 --> 00:42:41,054
Well then, I guess I can skip it.

391
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,996
Twelve gauge. You need shells?

392
00:42:57,997 --> 00:43:02,021
- Yeah. Double ought.
- They'll give you a wallop.

393
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:03,974
Y'all got camping supplies?

394
00:43:03,975 --> 00:43:06,070
Tent poles?

395
00:43:06,101 --> 00:43:07,776
You already have a tent?

396
00:43:07,777 --> 00:43:08,991
Somethin' like that.

397
00:43:08,992 --> 00:43:11,786
Well, you give me the model number on the
tent, I can order you the poles.

398
00:43:11,787 --> 00:43:13,315
Never mind. I want a tent.

399
00:43:13,316 --> 00:43:16,642
- Well, what kind of tent?
- The kind with the most poles.

400
00:43:39,107 --> 00:43:40,261
Could I get another room?

401
00:43:40,262 --> 00:43:41,824
You want to change rooms?

402
00:43:41,825 --> 00:43:44,327
No m'am, I want to keep my room
and get another one.

403
00:43:44,328 --> 00:43:45,721
Another additional?

404
00:43:45,722 --> 00:43:47,005
Yes, m'am.

405
00:43:47,006 --> 00:43:49,203
And do you have a map of the rooms?

406
00:43:49,204 --> 00:43:52,331
Yeah, we had a sorta one.

407
00:43:59,766 --> 00:44:01,340
How bout 38?

408
00:44:01,424 --> 00:44:04,327
Well, you can have the one right
next to yours if you want.

409
00:44:04,328 --> 00:44:06,234
Number 137. It ain't took.

410
00:44:06,235 --> 00:44:07,921
No, 38 will be fine.

411
00:44:08,287 --> 00:44:10,399
That's got two double beds.

412
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,671
No me, mate.

413
00:50:45,682 --> 00:50:47,571
How'd you find it?

414
00:50:48,117 --> 00:50:50,232
No me, mate.

415
00:52:34,443 --> 00:52:39,211
Shouldn't be doin' that.
Even a young man like you.

416
00:52:40,858 --> 00:52:44,952
- Doin what?
- Hitchhiking.

417
00:52:50,323 --> 00:52:52,358
Dangerous.

418
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:13,619
You know Anton Chigurh by sight,
is that correct?

419
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:16,240
Yessir.

420
00:53:17,224 --> 00:53:18,944
When did you last see him?

421
00:53:21,161 --> 00:53:23,770
November 28th, last year.

422
00:53:24,882 --> 00:53:28,366
You seem pretty sure of the date.
Did I ask you to sit?

423
00:53:28,367 --> 00:53:29,112
No sir.

424
00:53:29,113 --> 00:53:32,993
But you struck me as a man who wouldn't
want to waste a chair.

425
00:53:32,994 --> 00:53:37,671
I remember dates. Names. Numbers.
I saw him November the 28th.

426
00:53:40,316 --> 00:53:42,235
We got a loose cannon here.

427
00:53:42,236 --> 00:53:43,577
And we're out a bunch of money,...

428
00:53:43,578 --> 00:53:45,504
...and the other party is out his product.

429
00:53:45,505 --> 00:53:46,501
Yessir.

430
00:53:46,502 --> 00:53:51,452
This account will give up twelve hundred dollars
in any twenty-four hour period.

431
00:53:51,469 --> 00:53:53,545
That's up from a thousand.

432
00:53:53,653 --> 00:53:56,289
If your expenses run higher I hope
you'll trust us for it.

433
00:53:57,142 --> 00:53:58,665
Okay.

434
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,885
Just how well do you know Chigurh?

435
00:54:02,214 --> 00:54:03,340
What do you want to know?

436
00:54:03,341 --> 00:54:05,788
I just want to know your opinion of him.

437
00:54:05,789 --> 00:54:06,707
In general.

438
00:54:07,152 --> 00:54:09,632
Just how dangerous is he?

439
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:12,589
Compared to what? The bubonic plague?

440
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:14,847
He's bad enough that you called me.

441
00:54:14,932 --> 00:54:18,569
Yeah, he's a psychopathic killer but so what?

442
00:54:19,569 --> 00:54:21,056
There's plenty of them around.

443
00:54:21,295 --> 00:54:23,912
He killed three men in Del Rio Motel yesterday.

444
00:54:23,913 --> 00:54:27,697
And two others in that colossal
goatfuck out in the desert.

445
00:54:28,041 --> 00:54:29,442
We can stop that.

446
00:54:29,443 --> 00:54:31,167
You seem pretty sure of yourself.

447
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:36,888
You've led something of a charmed
life haven't you, Mr. Wells?

448
00:54:37,404 --> 00:54:38,826
In all honesty,...

449
00:54:38,827 --> 00:54:42,512
...I can't say that charm has had a
whole lot to do with it.

450
00:54:44,403 --> 00:54:45,826
I'm wondering...

451
00:54:45,871 --> 00:54:47,258
Yes?

452
00:54:48,019 --> 00:54:50,529
Can I get my parking ticket validated?

453
00:54:52,592 --> 00:54:55,385
An attempt at humor, I suppose.

454
00:54:55,422 --> 00:54:56,948
I'm sorry.

455
00:55:01,404 --> 00:55:07,367
- You know I counted the floors of this building from the street?
- And?

456
00:55:07,711 --> 00:55:09,822
There's one missing.

457
00:55:12,241 --> 00:55:14,225
We'll look into it.

458
00:55:33,919 --> 00:55:36,597
One room, one night.

459
00:55:36,946 --> 00:55:40,141
- That'll be twenty-six dollars.
- Alright.

460
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:46,019
You on all night?

461
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:49,032
Yessir, I'll be around here until
ten o'clock in the morning.

462
00:55:50,953 --> 00:55:54,593
This here's for you. Now, I ain't
asking you to do anything illegal.

463
00:55:55,395 --> 00:55:57,672
There's someone who's been
lookin for me. Not police.

464
00:55:57,673 --> 00:56:01,186
Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.

465
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:04,028
By anyone, I mean any swinging dude.

466
00:56:45,006 --> 00:56:47,823
There just ain't no way.

467
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:27,330
Don't worry. I ain't gonna hurt you.

468
01:02:28,127 --> 01:02:30,136
I need you to drive me on out of here.

469
01:06:09,284 --> 01:06:11,100
Were you in a car accident?

470
01:06:13,098 --> 01:06:15,633
I'll give you five hundred bucks for that coat.

471
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:18,880
Let me see the money.

472
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,321
Were you in a car accident?

473
01:06:24,527 --> 01:06:25,633
Yeah.

474
01:06:27,033 --> 01:06:29,694
- Gimme the money.
- It's right here. Give me the clothes.

475
01:06:30,023 --> 01:06:32,224
Let him hold the money.

476
01:06:47,824 --> 01:06:49,541
Gimme that beer too.

477
01:06:51,848 --> 01:06:53,199
How much?

478
01:06:54,364 --> 01:06:56,116
Brian. Give him the beer.

479
01:09:07,981 --> 01:09:12,111
Medico. Por favor.

480
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:18,002
Any word on those vehicles yet?

481
01:13:18,724 --> 01:13:21,063
Sheriff, I found out everything there was to find.

482
01:13:21,708 --> 01:13:24,835
Those vehicles are titled and registered
to deceased people.

483
01:13:26,234 --> 01:13:28,644
The owner of that Bronco's
been dead twenty years.

484
01:13:28,895 --> 01:13:31,033
Did you want me to see what I could
find out about the Mexican ones?

485
01:13:31,438 --> 01:13:33,020
No. Lord no.

486
01:13:33,914 --> 01:13:35,672
Here's this month's checks.

487
01:13:36,970 --> 01:13:38,956
That DEA agent called again.

488
01:13:38,991 --> 01:13:40,069
You don't want to talk to him?

489
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:42,227
I'm goin' to try and keep from it
as much as I can.

490
01:13:42,538 --> 01:13:45,564
He's goin' back out there and he wanted
to know if you wanted to go with him.

491
01:13:45,599 --> 01:13:47,336
That's cordial of him.

492
01:13:48,146 --> 01:13:50,418
Could I get you to call Loretta for me...

493
01:13:50,419 --> 01:13:52,692
...and tell her I'm goin' to Odessa
to see Carla Jean Moss?

494
01:13:52,727 --> 01:13:54,176
Yes, Sheriff.

495
01:13:54,211 --> 01:13:56,382
I'll call her when I get there.

496
01:13:56,417 --> 01:13:59,160
I'd call her now but she'll want me to come
home and I just might.

497
01:13:59,195 --> 01:14:02,146
- You want me to wait til you've quit the building?
- Uhuh.

498
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:06,064
You don't want to lie without what
it's absolutely necessary.

499
01:14:09,273 --> 01:14:12,163
What is it that Torbert says
about truth and justice?

500
01:14:12,941 --> 01:14:16,742
Oh, we dedicate ourselves daily anew.
Something like that.

501
01:14:16,777 --> 01:14:19,606
I think I'm goin' to commence dedicatin'
myself twice daily.

502
01:14:19,641 --> 01:14:22,435
It might come to three times
before it's over...

503
01:14:23,817 --> 01:14:25,364
Oh, what the hell?

504
01:14:33,903 --> 01:14:35,229
Sheriff?

505
01:14:36,704 --> 01:14:37,653
Have you looked at your load lately?

506
01:14:39,994 --> 01:14:41,028
That is a damned outrage.

507
01:14:42,371 --> 01:14:44,242
Oh. One of those tiedowns worked lose.

508
01:14:44,492 --> 01:14:45,883
How many bodies did you leave with?

509
01:14:46,443 --> 01:14:48,178
I ain't lost none of 'em, Sheriff.

510
01:14:49,482 --> 01:14:51,756
Couldn't you all of took a van out there?

511
01:14:52,193 --> 01:14:54,305
Didn't have no van with four-wheel drive.

512
01:14:54,559 --> 01:14:57,026
You going to write me up for
improperly secured load?

513
01:14:57,061 --> 01:14:58,694
You get your ass out of here.

514
01:15:05,936 --> 01:15:08,839
I'm guessin' this isn't the future you had
pictured for yourself...

515
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,743
...when you first clapped eyes
on that money.

516
01:15:12,386 --> 01:15:15,761
Don't worry. I'm not the man
that's after you.

517
01:15:16,353 --> 01:15:17,744
I know.

518
01:15:19,637 --> 01:15:22,401
- I've seen him.
- You've seen him?

519
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:24,446
And you're not dead.

520
01:15:26,604 --> 01:15:29,478
Is this guy supposed to be the
ultimate bad-ass?

521
01:15:29,683 --> 01:15:33,013
- No, I don't think that's how I'd describe him.
- How would you describe him?

522
01:15:34,355 --> 01:15:37,547
I guess I'd say... he doesn't have a
sense of humor.

523
01:15:38,001 --> 01:15:39,663
His name is Chigurh.

524
01:15:39,698 --> 01:15:42,343
- Sugar?
- Chigurh. Anton Chigurh.

525
01:15:43,065 --> 01:15:46,150
- You know how he found you?
- I know how he found me.

526
01:15:46,185 --> 01:15:48,949
- It's called a transponder.
- I know what it is.

527
01:15:49,471 --> 01:15:51,172
He won't find me again.

528
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:53,511
- Not that way.
- Not any way.

529
01:15:53,546 --> 01:15:57,059
- Took me about three hours.
- Yeah, well, I've been immobile.

530
01:15:57,972 --> 01:16:00,515
No. You don't understand.

531
01:16:02,219 --> 01:16:05,797
- What do you do?
- I'm retired.

532
01:16:05,999 --> 01:16:07,477
What did you do?

533
01:16:07,512 --> 01:16:09,760
- Welder.
- Acetylene? Mig? Tig?

534
01:16:09,795 --> 01:16:12,231
Any of it. If it can be welded, I can weld it.

535
01:16:12,266 --> 01:16:14,165
- Cast iron?
- Yes.

536
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,502
- I don't mean braze.
- I didn't say braze.

537
01:16:16,537 --> 01:16:18,701
- Pot metal?
- What did I say?

538
01:16:20,286 --> 01:16:21,986
Were you in Nam?

539
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:25,048
Yeah. I was in Nam.

540
01:16:26,818 --> 01:16:28,661
So was I.

541
01:16:29,044 --> 01:16:31,312
So what does that make me, your buddy?

542
01:16:33,220 --> 01:16:37,701
Look, you gotta give me this money.
I got no other reason to protect you.

543
01:16:38,952 --> 01:16:41,267
It's too late. I spent it.

544
01:16:43,078 --> 01:16:46,992
About a million and a half on whores and whiskey
and the rest of it I just sort of blew it here.

545
01:16:49,942 --> 01:16:52,642
How do you know he's not on his way to Odessa?

546
01:16:56,568 --> 01:17:00,642
- Why would he go to Odessa?
- To kill your wife.

547
01:17:07,821 --> 01:17:09,895
Maybe he's the one who needs to be worried.

548
01:17:11,113 --> 01:17:13,396
- About me.
- He isn't.

549
01:17:15,534 --> 01:17:17,490
You're not cut out for this.

550
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:22,054
You're just a guy who happened to
find those vehicles.

551
01:17:27,274 --> 01:17:31,775
I'm across the river. At the Hotel Eagle.
Carson Wells.

552
01:17:32,932 --> 01:17:35,116
Call me when you've had enough.

553
01:17:35,367 --> 01:17:37,822
I can even let you keep a
little of the money.

554
01:17:38,181 --> 01:17:39,322
If I was into cutting deals,...

555
01:17:39,323 --> 01:17:41,605
...why wouldn't I just deal
with this guy Chigurh?

556
01:17:42,308 --> 01:17:45,900
You don't understand. You can't
make a deal with him.

557
01:17:46,214 --> 01:17:48,744
Even if you gave him the money back,
he'd still kill you...

558
01:17:48,745 --> 01:17:51,275
...just for inconvenience in him.

559
01:17:51,556 --> 01:17:55,213
He's a peculiar man. Might even say
he has principles.

560
01:17:55,528 --> 01:18:00,328
Principles that transcend money or
drugs or anything like that.

561
01:18:00,806 --> 01:18:05,360
He's not like you.
He's not even like me.

562
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:09,841
He don't talk as much as you, I
give him points for that.

563
01:18:11,677 --> 01:18:13,830
Carla Jean. Thank you for comin'.

564
01:18:13,865 --> 01:18:15,261
Don't know why I did.

565
01:18:15,968 --> 01:18:18,825
I told you, I don't know where he is.

566
01:18:19,077 --> 01:18:21,121
- You ain't heard from him?
- No I ain't.

567
01:18:21,156 --> 01:18:23,032
- Nothin'?
- Not word one.

568
01:18:23,249 --> 01:18:27,168
- Would you tell me if you had?
- Well, I don't know.

569
01:18:28,121 --> 01:18:31,433
-  He don't need any trouble from you.
- It ain't me he's in trouble with.

570
01:18:32,255 --> 01:18:35,419
- Who's he in trouble with then?
- Some pretty bad people.

571
01:18:36,426 --> 01:18:39,721
These people will kill him, Carla Jean.
They won't quit.

572
01:18:39,983 --> 01:18:42,907
He won't neither.
He never has.

573
01:18:43,549 --> 01:18:45,764
He can take all comers.

574
01:18:48,454 --> 01:18:51,876
You know Charlie Walser?
He's got that place out east of Sanderson?

575
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:58,198
Well you know how they used to slaughter beefs,
hit 'em right there with a maul...

576
01:18:58,233 --> 01:19:00,003
..truss 'em up and slit their throats?

577
01:19:00,459 --> 01:19:03,215
Here Charlie's got one all trussed up
and all set to drain him...

578
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:05,598
...and the beef comes to.
It starts thrashing around.

579
01:19:06,641 --> 01:19:10,790
Six hundred pounds of very pissed-off livestock
if you'll excuse me.

580
01:19:11,788 --> 01:19:14,473
Charlie grabs his gun there to shoot the
damn thing in the head...

581
01:19:14,865 --> 01:19:20,270
...but with all the swayin' and then the trashin' it's a glance-shot and
ricochets around and comes back hits Charlie in the shoulder.

582
01:19:20,305 --> 01:19:21,537
You go see Charlie,...

583
01:19:21,538 --> 01:19:24,002
he still can't pick up his right hand for his hat...

584
01:19:24,553 --> 01:19:27,672
The point bein', even in the contest
between man and steer,...

585
01:19:27,673 --> 01:19:30,192
...the issue is not certain.

586
01:19:37,910 --> 01:19:42,620
When Llewelyn calls, just tell him
I'll make him safe.

587
01:19:47,444 --> 01:19:50,097
Course they slaughter steers a lot
different these days.

588
01:19:51,055 --> 01:19:52,865
Use a air gun.

589
01:19:53,068 --> 01:19:58,106
Shoots out a little rock, about that far into the brain.
Sucks right back in. Animal never knows what hit him.

590
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:04,630
- Why you telling me that, Sheriff?
- I don't know.

591
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:10,787
My mind wanders.

592
01:21:33,846 --> 01:21:35,138
Hello, Carson.

593
01:21:38,264 --> 01:21:39,452
Let's go to your room.

594
01:21:52,222 --> 01:21:54,425
We don't have to do this.

595
01:21:54,426 --> 01:21:58,830
I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.

596
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:02,077
Why would I let you do that?

597
01:22:02,389 --> 01:22:04,377
I'll make it worth your while.

598
01:22:04,412 --> 01:22:08,000
Take you to an ATM. Forteen grand in it.

599
01:22:08,115 --> 01:22:10,037
And everybody just walks away.

600
01:22:11,974 --> 01:22:13,724
An ATM...

601
01:22:17,923 --> 01:22:22,763
- I know where the satchel is.
- If you knew, you would have it with you.

602
01:22:23,468 --> 01:22:27,517
Find it from the river bank. I know where it is.

603
01:22:28,758 --> 01:22:30,704
I know something better.

604
01:22:31,347 --> 01:22:33,377
- What's that?
- I know where it's going to be.

605
01:22:34,858 --> 01:22:41,359
- Where is that?
- It will be brought to me and placed at my feet.

606
01:22:42,822 --> 01:22:48,205
You don't know to a certainty.
Twenty minutes it could be here.

607
01:22:48,411 --> 01:22:52,570
I do know to a certainty. And you know
what's going to happen now, Carson?

608
01:22:53,661 --> 01:22:58,207
You should admit your situation.
There would be more dignity in it.

609
01:23:03,456 --> 01:23:04,851
You go to hell.

610
01:23:07,169 --> 01:23:08,427
Alright.

611
01:23:08,854 --> 01:23:10,208
Let me ask you something.

612
01:23:12,259 --> 01:23:17,163
If the rule you followed
brought you to this,...

613
01:23:17,164 --> 01:23:19,615
...of what use was the rule?

614
01:23:25,206 --> 01:23:29,551
Do you have any idea how crazy you are?

615
01:23:30,603 --> 01:23:32,918
You mean the nature of this conversation?

616
01:23:33,287 --> 01:23:35,106
I mean the nature of you.

617
01:23:41,548 --> 01:23:45,737
You can have the money, Anton.

618
01:24:25,052 --> 01:24:26,364
<i>Hello?</i>

619
01:24:26,399 --> 01:24:27,677
Yes?

620
01:24:30,638 --> 01:24:32,426
<i>Is Carson Wells there?</i>

621
01:24:34,741 --> 01:24:36,928
Not in the sense that you mean.

622
01:24:39,262 --> 01:24:41,287
<i>You need to come see me.</i>

623
01:24:41,552 --> 01:24:43,177
Who is this?

624
01:24:43,678 --> 01:24:45,137
You know who it is.

625
01:24:46,429 --> 01:24:48,335
You need to talk to me.

626
01:24:48,577 --> 01:24:49,842
<i>I don't need to talk to you.</i>

627
01:24:49,843 --> 01:24:51,110
I think you do.

628
01:24:52,053 --> 01:24:54,262
Do you know where I'm going?

629
01:24:54,617 --> 01:24:56,796
Why would I care where you're going.

630
01:24:56,831 --> 01:24:58,836
I know where you are.

631
01:24:59,357 --> 01:25:01,390
<i>Yeah? Where am I?</i>

632
01:25:01,425 --> 01:25:03,465
You're in a hospital across the river.

633
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:08,454
But that's not where I'm going.
Do you know where I'm going?

634
01:25:10,777 --> 01:25:12,416
<i>Yeah. I know where you're going.</i>

635
01:25:12,451 --> 01:25:14,025
Alright.

636
01:25:14,683 --> 01:25:16,526
<i>You know she won't be there. </i>

637
01:25:16,561 --> 01:25:18,742
It doesn't make any difference where she is.

638
01:25:18,777 --> 01:25:20,651
So what're you goin up there for?

639
01:25:24,745 --> 01:25:27,329
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?

640
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:30,379
No.

641
01:25:31,501 --> 01:25:35,276
I think you do too.
So this is what I'll offer.

642
01:25:36,121 --> 01:25:38,576
You bring me the money and I'll let her go.

643
01:25:39,544 --> 01:25:43,340
<i>Otherwise she's accountable.
Same as you.</i>

644
01:25:45,522 --> 01:25:47,871
That's the best deal you're going to get.

645
01:25:47,906 --> 01:25:52,114
I won't tell you you can save yourself
because you can't.

646
01:25:55,271 --> 01:25:57,440
Yeah, I'm goin to bring you somethin' alright.

647
01:25:58,686 --> 01:26:01,177
I've decided to make you a special
project of mine.

648
01:26:01,212 --> 01:26:03,170
You ain't goin' to have to come
look for me at all.

649
01:26:08,053 --> 01:26:10,066
- The motel in Del Rio?
- Yessir.

650
01:26:10,562 --> 01:26:12,593
None of the three had ID on 'em,...

651
01:26:12,628 --> 01:26:14,457
...but they're tellin me that all three is Mexicans.

652
01:26:15,132 --> 01:26:15,962
Was Mexicans.

653
01:26:16,126 --> 01:26:20,911
There's a question.  Whether they
stopped it? And when?

654
01:26:22,893 --> 01:26:24,443
Yessir.

655
01:26:25,082 --> 01:26:27,525
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about
the lock cylinder?

656
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:30,401
- Yessir. It was punched out.
- Okay.

657
01:26:31,616 --> 01:26:32,874
You wanna drive out there?

658
01:26:32,909 --> 01:26:36,926
No, that's all I've to look for and it sounds like
these old boys died of natural causes.

659
01:26:37,301 --> 01:26:38,406
How's that, Sheriff?

660
01:26:38,407 --> 01:26:40,614
Natural to the line of work they was in.

661
01:26:40,649 --> 01:26:41,647
Yessir.

662
01:26:41,682 --> 01:26:45,464
My god, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I can't
think of any other word for it.

663
01:26:45,499 --> 01:26:47,692
Who are these people?

664
01:26:47,942 --> 01:26:50,531
Here last week they found this couple out...

665
01:26:50,532 --> 01:26:53,118
...in California, they'd rent out
rooms to old people.

666
01:26:53,153 --> 01:26:57,777
Kill em, bury em in the yard and cash their
social security checks.

667
01:26:58,571 --> 01:27:02,243
They'd torture them first.
I don't know why.

668
01:27:03,085 --> 01:27:05,571
Maybe their television set was broke.

669
01:27:05,882 --> 01:27:08,419
And this went on until, and here I quote:

670
01:27:09,713 --> 01:27:14,570
<i>Neighbors were alerted when a man ran
from the premises wearing only a dog collar.</i>

671
01:27:16,289 --> 01:27:19,868
You can't make up such a thing as that.
I dare you to even try.

672
01:27:19,903 --> 01:27:23,170
But that's what it took, you'll notice.
Get somebody's attention.

673
01:27:23,205 --> 01:27:26,437
Diggin graves in the back yard
didn't bring any.

674
01:27:33,503 --> 01:27:35,972
That's all right. I laugh
myself sometimes.

675
01:27:38,482 --> 01:27:40,877
There ain't a whole lot else you can do.

676
01:27:43,365 --> 01:27:44,659
Tell me something.

677
01:27:45,085 --> 01:27:47,947
Who do you think gets through this gate
into the United States of America?

678
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:52,429
I don't know. American citizens?

679
01:27:52,723 --> 01:27:55,085
Some American citizens. Who do
you think decides?

680
01:27:55,317 --> 01:27:58,552
- Well, you do, I reckon.
- That is correct. How do I decide?

681
01:27:59,427 --> 01:28:01,315
- I don't know.
- I ask questions.

682
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:05,468
And if I get sensible answers then they get to go to America.
If I don't get sensible answers they don't.

683
01:28:05,503 --> 01:28:07,502
- Anything about that you don't understand?
- No sir.

684
01:28:07,537 --> 01:28:10,350
Then I ask you again. How you come to be
out here with no clothes?

685
01:28:11,789 --> 01:28:13,685
I got an overcoat on.

686
01:28:14,569 --> 01:28:16,366
- Are you jackin' with me?
- Oh, no sir.

687
01:28:16,401 --> 01:28:18,164
- Don't jack with me.
- Yes sir.

688
01:28:19,086 --> 01:28:21,340
- Are you in the service?
- No sir. I'm a veteran.

689
01:28:21,375 --> 01:28:23,759
- Nam?
- Yes sir. Two tours.

690
01:28:23,794 --> 01:28:24,973
What outfit?

691
01:28:25,008 --> 01:28:30,604
Twelfth Infantry Battalion.
August 7th 1966 to July 2nd 1968.

692
01:28:32,726 --> 01:28:34,431
- Wilson!
- Yessir.

693
01:28:36,374 --> 01:28:39,140
Get someone to help this man.
He needs to get into town.

694
01:28:48,325 --> 01:28:51,756
- How those Larries holdin' up?
- Oh, good.

695
01:28:51,791 --> 01:28:54,558
- I need everything else.
- Okay.

696
01:28:55,704 --> 01:28:58,290
You have a lot of people come in here
without any clothes on?

697
01:28:58,325 --> 01:29:00,682
No sir, it's unusual.

698
01:29:14,241 --> 01:29:15,607
<i>She don't want to talk to you.</i>

699
01:29:15,642 --> 01:29:16,973
Yes she does. Put her on.

700
01:29:17,008 --> 01:29:18,419
<i>Do you know what time it is?</i>

701
01:29:18,792 --> 01:29:21,087
I don't care what time it is. And
don't you hang up this phone.

702
01:29:26,350 --> 01:29:28,130
- Llewelyn.
- Hey you.

703
01:29:28,397 --> 01:29:31,364
- What should I do ?
- You know what's goin' on?

704
01:29:31,619 --> 01:29:35,129
I don't know, I had the sheriff here
from Terrell County.

705
01:29:35,164 --> 01:29:36,526
What did you tell him?

706
01:29:36,741 --> 01:29:41,024
<i>What did I know to tell him?
You're hurt, ain't you?</i>

707
01:29:42,729 --> 01:29:44,522
What makes you say that?

708
01:29:44,928 --> 01:29:46,424
<i>I can hear it in your voice.</i>

709
01:29:46,459 --> 01:29:48,615
<i>There is falseness in his voice!</i>

710
01:29:48,939 --> 01:29:51,595
Look, I want you to meet me at the
Desert Sands motel in El Paso.

711
01:29:52,379 --> 01:29:54,844
Cause I'm gonna give you the money
and I'ma put you on a plane.

712
01:29:54,879 --> 01:29:57,465
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.

713
01:29:57,500 --> 01:30:01,406
No. This works better. With you gone and
I don't have the money, he can't touch me.

714
01:30:01,441 --> 01:30:03,387
But I can sure touch him.

715
01:30:03,422 --> 01:30:05,845
And after I find him I'll
come and join you.

716
01:30:06,127 --> 01:30:09,486
<i>Find who? What am I supposed
to do with Mother?</i>

717
01:30:09,521 --> 01:30:11,679
- Nah, she'll be alright.
- She'll be alright?

718
01:30:11,714 --> 01:30:14,232
<i>Be all right?! I've got the cancer!</i>

719
01:30:14,267 --> 01:30:16,772
Ain't nobody's gonna bother her.

720
01:30:50,836 --> 01:30:52,054
Who are you?

721
01:30:56,613 --> 01:30:58,498
- Me?
- Yes.

722
01:30:58,533 --> 01:31:02,037
Nobody. Accounting.

723
01:31:04,066 --> 01:31:06,754
He gave the Mexicans a receiver.

724
01:31:08,910 --> 01:31:14,316
He feels...he felt that...
the more people looking...

725
01:31:14,351 --> 01:31:18,692
That's foolish. You pick the one right tool.

726
01:31:20,027 --> 01:31:25,526
I see. Are you going
to shoot me?

727
01:31:31,755 --> 01:31:37,849
That depends.
Do you see me?

728
01:31:40,881 --> 01:31:43,340
I always seen this is what it would come to.

729
01:31:43,631 --> 01:31:45,914
Three years ago I pre-visioned it.

730
01:31:46,163 --> 01:31:47,883
It ain't even three years we been married.

731
01:31:48,196 --> 01:31:52,304
Three years ago I said them
very words. No and Good.

732
01:31:52,508 --> 01:31:56,773
Here we are.
Ninety degree heat.

733
01:31:56,774 --> 01:32:01,040
I got the cancer. And look at this.
Not even a home to go to.

734
01:32:01,854 --> 01:32:07,805
We're goin' to El Paso Texas. You know how
many people I know in El Paso Texas?

735
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:11,166
- No ma'am.
- That's how many.

736
01:32:19,971 --> 01:32:23,074
- I didn't see my Prednizone.
- I put it in, Mama.

737
01:32:23,233 --> 01:32:26,562
- Well I didn't see it.
- Well, I put it in. That one.

738
01:32:27,016 --> 01:32:30,641
You just set there. I'll get tickets
and a cart for the bags.

739
01:32:31,048 --> 01:32:33,266
Do you need help with the bags, madam?

740
01:32:34,050 --> 01:32:36,953
Well, thank god there is one gentleman
left in West Texas.

741
01:32:37,226 --> 01:32:39,906
Yes, thank you. I am old
and I am not well.

742
01:32:40,202 --> 01:32:44,475
- Which bus are you taking?
- We're going to El Paso. Don't ask me why.

743
01:32:44,752 --> 01:32:47,427
It's not often you see a Mexican in a suit.

744
01:32:47,728 --> 01:32:50,916
You go to El Paso? I know it.
Where are you staying?

745
01:32:51,644 --> 01:32:53,330
<i>Carla Jean, how are you?</i>

746
01:32:53,551 --> 01:32:57,429
Sheriff, was that a true story about
Charlie Walser?

747
01:32:57,629 --> 01:32:59,229
<i>Who's Charlie Walser?</i>

748
01:33:02,698 --> 01:33:06,814
Oh! Oh, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail
but it's certainly true that it is a story.

749
01:33:07,649 --> 01:33:08,238
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

750
01:33:10,247 --> 01:33:12,272
Sheriff, can you give me
your word on somethin'?

751
01:33:12,397 --> 01:33:14,426
<i>Yes ma'am?</i>

752
01:33:14,832 --> 01:33:17,536
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed,...

753
01:33:17,537 --> 01:33:20,240
...you promise it'll be just you goes
and talks with him?

754
01:33:20,994 --> 01:33:22,257
You and nobody else.

755
01:33:22,582 --> 01:33:24,291
Yes ma'am, I do.

756
01:33:24,707 --> 01:33:26,728
<i>Llewelyn would never ask for help.</i>

757
01:33:27,176 --> 01:33:29,271
He never thinks he needs any.

758
01:33:29,490 --> 01:33:32,199
<i>Carla Jean, I will not harm your man.</i>

759
01:33:33,277 --> 01:33:36,867
<i>And he needs help, whether
he knows it or not.</i>

760
01:33:45,713 --> 01:33:47,566
What's the problem there, neighbor?

761
01:33:48,961 --> 01:33:52,152
That'll suck some power.
Over time.

762
01:33:54,068 --> 01:33:57,836
- You from around here?
- Alpine. Born and bred.

763
01:33:58,333 --> 01:33:58,946
Here ya go.

764
01:33:59,507 --> 01:34:04,712
- What airport would you use?
- Well? Airport or airstrip?

765
01:34:04,915 --> 01:34:08,104
- Airport.
- Well, where ya goin'?

766
01:34:09,039 --> 01:34:12,445
- I don't know.
- Just lightin' out for the territories, huh?

767
01:34:13,133 --> 01:34:15,059
Brother, I been there.

768
01:34:15,553 --> 01:34:16,029
Well...

769
01:34:16,646 --> 01:34:20,069
There's airstrips.
The airport is El Paso.

770
01:34:20,978 --> 01:34:24,365
You want some place specific you might could
be better off just drivin' to Dallas.

771
01:34:25,272 --> 01:34:26,058
Not have to connect.

772
01:34:27,435 --> 01:34:32,042
- You gonna clamp them, buddy?
- Can you get those chicken crates out of the bed?

773
01:34:33,142 --> 01:34:35,131
What're you talkin' about?

774
01:34:51,138 --> 01:34:56,006
- Hey. Mr. Sporting Goods.
- Hey yourself.

775
01:34:57,082 --> 01:34:57,838
You a sport?

776
01:34:59,131 --> 01:35:01,037
Yeah, that's me.

777
01:35:01,568 --> 01:35:03,424
I got beers in my room.

778
01:35:05,537 --> 01:35:07,456
Waiting on my wife.

779
01:35:08,296 --> 01:35:12,656
- That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
- Half.

780
01:35:12,691 --> 01:35:17,016
- What else then?
- Just lookin' for what's comin'.

781
01:35:18,487 --> 01:35:20,633
Yeah, but no one ever sees that.

782
01:35:21,676 --> 01:35:24,360
Beer. That's what's comin'.

783
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:27,548
I'll bring the ice chest out here.
You can stay married.

784
01:35:27,583 --> 01:35:30,050
No ma'am. I know what beer leads to.

785
01:35:32,017 --> 01:35:34,347
Beer leads to more beer.

786
01:36:27,690 --> 01:36:29,751
Call police.

787
01:36:35,659 --> 01:36:37,227
Your local law enforcement.

788
01:36:39,690 --> 01:36:40,867
I'm not on their radio.

789
01:37:31,548 --> 01:37:34,268
Buy you a cup of coffee
before you drive home?

790
01:37:34,862 --> 01:37:36,256
No money in his room there?

791
01:37:36,370 --> 01:37:40,885
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres
would've taken the stash.

792
01:37:41,393 --> 01:37:45,489
I suppose so. Though they was
leavin' in a hurry.

793
01:37:45,854 --> 01:37:48,629
It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom.

794
01:37:48,975 --> 01:37:50,675
The money and the drugs.

795
01:37:51,878 --> 01:37:54,928
It's just goddamned beyond everything.

796
01:37:55,396 --> 01:37:58,256
What's it mean?
What's it leading to?

797
01:37:58,801 --> 01:38:03,395
You know, if you'd a told me twenty years
ago, I'd see children walking...

798
01:38:03,396 --> 01:38:07,991
the streets of our Texas towns with green
hair and bones in their noses.

799
01:38:08,804 --> 01:38:10,706
I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.

800
01:38:11,073 --> 01:38:14,874
Signs and wonders. But I think once
you quit hearin' sir and ma'am,...

801
01:38:14,875 --> 01:38:16,774
...the rest is soon to follow.

802
01:38:17,302 --> 01:38:21,551
Oh, it's the tide.
It's the dismal tide.

803
01:38:21,832 --> 01:38:24,209
- It is not the one thing.
- Not the one thing.

804
01:38:24,556 --> 01:38:26,334
None of that explains your man though.

805
01:38:27,462 --> 01:38:30,483
He's just a goddamn homicidal
lunatic, Ed Tom.

806
01:38:30,732 --> 01:38:33,898
- I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
- Yeah well, what would you call him?

807
01:38:34,210 --> 01:38:37,867
I don't know. Sometimes I think
he's pretty much a ghost.

808
01:38:37,902 --> 01:38:39,745
- He's real all right.
- Oh yeah?

809
01:38:39,952 --> 01:38:43,858
All that at the ???
Motel. It's beyond everything.

810
01:38:44,242 --> 01:38:46,484
Yeah, he has some hard bark on him.

811
01:38:47,119 --> 01:38:49,119
That don't hardly say it.

812
01:38:50,070 --> 01:38:51,970
He shoots the desk clerk one day.

813
01:38:51,971 --> 01:38:55,774
Walks right back in the next
and shoots a retired army colonel.

814
01:38:56,484 --> 01:38:57,995
It's hard to believe.

815
01:38:58,214 --> 01:39:01,086
Strolls right back into a crime scene.

816
01:39:01,464 --> 01:39:06,122
Who would do such a thing?
How do you defend against it?

817
01:39:08,523 --> 01:39:09,837
Good trip, Ed Tom.

818
01:39:09,838 --> 01:39:12,464
I'm sorry we couldn't help your boy.

819
01:42:44,604 --> 01:42:46,260
Min back!

820
01:42:46,552 --> 01:42:50,258
- How'd you know I was here?
- Who else'd be driving up your truck?

821
01:42:51,017 --> 01:42:52,674
- You heard it?
- How's that?

822
01:42:53,019 --> 01:42:58,969
- You heard what I'm - you havin fun with me?
- What give you that idea?

823
01:42:59,601 --> 01:43:02,788
- I seen one of the cats heard it.
- But - how'd you know it was my truck?

824
01:43:03,633 --> 01:43:06,507
I deduced it. When you walked in.

825
01:43:06,740 --> 01:43:08,340
How many of those things you got now?

826
01:43:08,375 --> 01:43:10,686
Cats? I don't know. Several.

827
01:43:11,405 --> 01:43:13,657
Well, it depends on what you mean by got.

828
01:43:14,475 --> 01:43:18,292
Some of 'em are half-wild, and
some of 'em are just outlaws.

829
01:43:21,820 --> 01:43:24,623
How you been, Ellis?

830
01:43:24,624 --> 01:43:30,235
You lookin' at it. I got to say
you lookin' older.

831
01:43:30,441 --> 01:43:31,893
I am older.

832
01:43:33,063 --> 01:43:35,402
Got a letter from your wife.

833
01:43:35,403 --> 01:43:40,079
She writes to me pretty regular,
keep me up on the family news.

834
01:43:40,705 --> 01:43:43,602
- Didn't know there was any.
- She told me you were quittin'.

835
01:43:46,768 --> 01:43:49,469
- You want a cup?
- 'Preciate it.

836
01:43:57,126 --> 01:43:58,861
How fresh is that coffee?

837
01:43:59,187 --> 01:44:04,566
I generally make a fresh pot ever week
even if there's some left over.

838
01:44:06,833 --> 01:44:10,019
That man who shot you died in prison.

839
01:44:11,396 --> 01:44:12,988
In Angola.
Yeah.

840
01:44:13,709 --> 01:44:15,956
What would you a done if
he'd been released?

841
01:44:16,771 --> 01:44:21,386
I don't know. Nothin.
Wouldn't be no point to it.

842
01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:24,632
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.

843
01:44:24,667 --> 01:44:28,229
Well, all the time you spend
tryin' to get back...

844
01:44:28,230 --> 01:44:31,792
...what's been took from you more
is goin' out the door.

845
01:44:32,180 --> 01:44:35,957
After a while, you just have to try
to get a tourniquet on it.

846
01:44:36,326 --> 01:44:40,132
Your granddaddy never asked me
to sign on as a deputy.

847
01:44:43,086 --> 01:44:45,646
Loretta tells me you're quittin'.

848
01:44:46,086 --> 01:44:47,617
How come're you doin' that?

849
01:44:47,897 --> 01:44:49,444
I don't know.

850
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:54,557
I feel overmatched.

851
01:44:58,421 --> 01:45:00,801
I always figured when I got older,...

852
01:45:01,371 --> 01:45:05,920
...God would sort of come into
my life in some way.

853
01:45:09,011 --> 01:45:10,463
He didn't.

854
01:45:13,856 --> 01:45:15,857
I don't blame him.

855
01:45:17,955 --> 01:45:21,338
If I was him I'd have the same opinion
about me that he does.

856
01:45:21,622 --> 01:45:23,733
You don't know what he thinks.

857
01:45:37,671 --> 01:45:41,786
I sent Uncle Mac's thumbbuster and
badge over to the Rangers.

858
01:45:41,787 --> 01:45:42,787
Put up in a museum.

859
01:45:44,213 --> 01:45:47,947
Your daddy ever tell you how
Uncle Mac come to his reward?

860
01:45:48,749 --> 01:45:52,433
Gunned down on his own porch
over in Hudspeth County.

861
01:45:54,673 --> 01:45:59,238
Seven or eight of 'em come up to here.
Wantin' this and wantin' that.

862
01:45:59,843 --> 01:46:02,734
Uncle Mac went back in the house
and got the shotgun,...

863
01:46:02,735 --> 01:46:05,626
They was way ahead of him.

864
01:46:06,779 --> 01:46:08,937
Shot him in the doorway.

865
01:46:09,404 --> 01:46:12,233
Aunt Ella came out and tried to stop the bleedin'.

866
01:46:12,268 --> 01:46:15,063
Uncle Mac all the while tryin'
to get that shotgun.

867
01:46:15,748 --> 01:46:19,654
They just sat there on their
horses watchin' him die.

868
01:46:21,279 --> 01:46:26,156
After a while, one of 'em says somethin in
Injun and they all turned and left out.

869
01:46:30,405 --> 01:46:34,250
Well, Uncle Mac knew the score
even if Aunt Ella didn't.

870
01:46:34,285 --> 01:46:36,655
Shot through the left lung.

871
01:46:37,532 --> 01:46:41,843
And that was that. As they say.

872
01:46:44,943 --> 01:46:50,680
- When did he die?
- 1909.

873
01:46:50,927 --> 01:46:56,721
No, I mean was it right away or in
the night or when was it?

874
01:46:56,929 --> 01:47:00,619
I believe it's that night. She
buried him the next mornin'.

875
01:47:01,226 --> 01:47:03,517
Diggin' in that hard old caliche.

876
01:47:07,090 --> 01:47:10,046
What you got ain't nothin new.

877
01:47:10,590 --> 01:47:13,588
This country is hard on people.

878
01:47:16,729 --> 01:47:19,465
You can't stop what's comin'.

879
01:47:20,808 --> 01:47:23,652
Ain't all waitin' on you.

880
01:47:25,799 --> 01:47:28,433
That's vanity.

881
01:48:28,490 --> 01:48:33,147
- I knew this wasn't done with.
- No.

882
01:48:33,837 --> 01:48:38,129
I ain't got the money.

883
01:48:38,130 --> 01:48:42,423
What little I had is long gone and
there's bills aplenty to pay yet.

884
01:48:43,929 --> 01:48:48,274
I buried my mother today.
I ain't paid for that neither.

885
01:48:49,325 --> 01:48:51,650
I wouldn't worry about it.

886
01:48:53,899 --> 01:48:56,274
I need to sit down.

887
01:49:10,890 --> 01:49:13,401
You got no cause to hurt me.

888
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:17,213
No. But I gave my word.

889
01:49:18,102 --> 01:49:22,215
- You gave your word?
- To your husband.

890
01:49:24,828 --> 01:49:30,810
That don't make sense. You gave your
word to my husband to kill me?

891
01:49:31,083 --> 01:49:34,375
Your husband had the
opportunity to save you.

892
01:49:34,376 --> 01:49:37,668
Instead, he used you to try
to save himself.

893
01:49:42,663 --> 01:49:48,518
Not like that.
Not like you say.

894
01:49:53,970 --> 01:49:55,845
You don't have to do this.

895
01:49:56,190 --> 01:49:57,910
They'll always say the same thing.

896
01:49:59,751 --> 01:50:01,649
What did they say?

897
01:50:02,066 --> 01:50:05,221
They say you don't have to do this.

898
01:50:05,628 --> 01:50:07,157
You don't.

899
01:50:15,651 --> 01:50:17,816
This is the best I can do.

900
01:50:18,932 --> 01:50:20,535
Call it.

901
01:50:24,975 --> 01:50:28,474
I knowed you was crazy when
I saw you sittin' there.

902
01:50:30,317 --> 01:50:33,473
I knowed exactly what was in store for me.

903
01:50:33,974 --> 01:50:36,505
- Call it.
- No.

904
01:50:37,943 --> 01:50:39,944
I ain't gonna call it.

905
01:50:43,371 --> 01:50:47,535
- Call it.
- The coin don't have no say.

906
01:50:48,071 --> 01:50:50,347
It's just you.

907
01:50:52,726 --> 01:50:56,226
Well, I got here the same
way the coin did.

908
01:52:38,563 --> 01:52:41,688
Mister, there's a bone stickin' out of your arm.

909
01:52:42,043 --> 01:52:43,922
I'm alright. Let me just sit
here a minute.

910
01:52:44,224 --> 01:52:47,154
There's an ambulance comin'.
Man over yonder went to call.

911
01:52:47,389 --> 01:52:48,795
Alright.

912
01:52:49,452 --> 01:52:53,264
Are you all right? You got a
bone stickin' out of your arm.

913
01:52:54,267 --> 01:52:56,577
What will you take for that shirt?

914
01:53:01,562 --> 01:53:04,405
Hell mister, I'll give you my shirt.

915
01:53:11,454 --> 01:53:14,235
Look at that fuckin' bone.

916
01:53:14,446 --> 01:53:16,359
Tie this for me.

917
01:53:16,609 --> 01:53:18,486
Just tie it.

918
01:53:36,882 --> 01:53:41,425
Hell mister. Look, I don't mind helping
someone out. That's a lot of money.

919
01:53:41,460 --> 01:53:46,557
Take it. Take it and you
didn't see me.

920
01:53:46,758 --> 01:53:48,255
I was already gone.

921
01:53:48,550 --> 01:53:50,133
Yessir.

922
01:53:54,486 --> 01:53:57,849
- Part of that's mine.
- You still got your damn shirt.

923
01:53:57,884 --> 01:54:01,334
- That ain't what it was for.
- Well maybe, but I'm still out a shirt.

924
01:54:22,661 --> 01:54:25,258
- Maybe I'll go ridin'.
- Okay.

925
01:54:25,464 --> 01:54:28,535
- What do you think?
- I can't plan your day.

926
01:54:30,442 --> 01:54:31,974
I mean, would you care to join me?

927
01:54:32,319 --> 01:54:34,194
Lord no. I'm not retired.

928
01:54:35,976 --> 01:54:38,371
Maybe I'll help out here then.

929
01:54:39,256 --> 01:54:40,961
Better not.

930
01:54:44,696 --> 01:54:48,228
- How'd you sleep?
- I don't know. Had dreams.

931
01:54:48,475 --> 01:54:51,852
Well you got time for 'em now.
Anything interesting?

932
01:54:52,571 --> 01:54:55,279
They always is to the
party concerned.

933
01:54:57,757 --> 01:55:00,616
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.

934
01:55:03,821 --> 01:55:06,511
Okay. Two of 'em. Both
had my father. It's peculiar.

935
01:55:07,885 --> 01:55:11,301
I'm older now than he ever
was by twenty years.

936
01:55:11,301 --> 01:55:15,158
So, in a sense he's the younger man.

937
01:55:15,727 --> 01:55:17,977
Anyway, first one I don't remember
too well but...

938
01:55:17,978 --> 01:55:22,479
It was about meeting him in town someplace
where he gave me some money.

939
01:55:23,479 --> 01:55:25,289
I think I lost it.

940
01:55:27,137 --> 01:55:31,520
The second one, it was like we
was both back in older times...

941
01:55:32,168 --> 01:55:36,013
...and I was on horseback goin'
through the mountains of a night.

942
01:55:36,231 --> 01:55:39,543
Goin' through this pass in the mountains.

943
01:55:39,791 --> 01:55:48,450
It was cold and there's snow on the ground. He rode past me and
kept on goin'. Never said nothin goin' by. He just rode on past.

944
01:55:50,042 --> 01:55:54,170
He had his blanket wrapped around
him and his head down.

945
01:55:55,652 --> 01:55:57,666
When he rode past I seen he was...

946
01:55:57,667 --> 01:55:59,681
...carryin fire in a horn...

947
01:55:59,716 --> 01:56:04,057
...the way people used to do and I could see
the horn from the light inside of it.

948
01:56:04,297 --> 01:56:06,060
About the color of the moon.

949
01:56:07,590 --> 01:56:12,839
And in the dream I knew that
he was goin' on ahead...

950
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:18,090
and that he's fixin to make a fire somewhere
out there in all that dark and all that cold.

951
01:56:21,748 --> 01:56:26,298
I knew that whenever I got
there he'd be there.

952
01:56:29,238 --> 01:56:30,348
Then, I woke up.

953
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:43,062
