00:00:15,354 --> 00:00:18,152
<i>The latest ceasefire came too late
to save these villages...</i>

2
00:00:22,995 --> 00:00:28,661
<i>Today President Clinton voiced concerns
at the deteriorating situation in Sarajevo...</i>

3
00:00:33,473 --> 00:00:37,671
<i>When people ask me, good listeners,
why do I hate all the Tutsi.</i>

4
00:00:37,743 --> 00:00:40,610
<i>I say. "Read our history."</i>

5
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,615
<i>The Tutsi were collaborators
for the Belgian colonists.</i>

6
00:00:43,683 --> 00:00:46,675
<i>They stole our Hutu land,
they whipped us.</i>

7
00:00:46,752 --> 00:00:49,846
<i>Now they have come back,
these Tutsi rebels.</i>

8
00:00:49,922 --> 00:00:53,187
<i>They are cockroaches.
They are murderers.</i>

9
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:57,855
<i>Rwanda is our Hutu land.
We are the majority.</i>

10
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,457
<i>They are a minority of traitors
and invaders.</i>

11
00:01:01,534 --> 00:01:07,370
<i>We will squash the infestation.
We will wipe out the RPF rebels.</i>

12
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,932
<i>This is RTLM, Hutu Power Radio.</i>

13
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,104
<i>Stay alert.
Watch your neighbors.</i>

14
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:37,025
- Mr. Rusesabagina, thank you.
- Good to see you, sir.

15
00:01:49,282 --> 00:01:50,271
Thank you.

16
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:52,749
These are for you, sir.
They're fresh from Havana.

17
00:01:52,818 --> 00:01:55,810
Wonderful. Next time you are there,
tell Fidel that I said hello.

18
00:01:56,689 --> 00:01:58,020
Good to see you gentlemen.

19
00:02:22,615 --> 00:02:25,175
That is a fine cigar, sir.

20
00:02:25,851 --> 00:02:27,580
This is a Cohiba cigar.

21
00:02:27,653 --> 00:02:31,589
- Each one is worth 10,000 francs.
- 10,000 francs?

22
00:02:31,657 --> 00:02:34,956
Yes, yes. But it is worth
more to me than 10,000 francs.

23
00:02:35,027 --> 00:02:36,654
What do you mean, sir?

24
00:02:39,365 --> 00:02:43,461
If I give a businessman 10,000 francs,
what does that matter to him?

25
00:02:43,536 --> 00:02:47,472
He is rich.
But if I give him a Cohiba cigar

26
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,239
straight from Havana, Cuba...
Hey, that is style, Dube.

27
00:02:53,012 --> 00:02:54,104
Style.

28
00:03:04,056 --> 00:03:07,048
Cohiba--a fantastic cigar.

29
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,257
The best, eh?

30
00:03:09,328 --> 00:03:11,990
So, you're going to join us
at the rally today?

31
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:15,898
I will try my best, George,

32
00:03:15,968 --> 00:03:19,563
but these days I have no time
for rallies and politics.

33
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:23,040
Politics is power, Paul.
Hutu power.

34
00:03:23,109 --> 00:03:24,474
And money.

35
00:03:28,814 --> 00:03:30,975
It's time for you
to join your people.

36
00:03:32,518 --> 00:03:33,815
Thank you, George.

37
00:03:34,687 --> 00:03:36,678
But time is also money.

38
00:03:38,024 --> 00:03:40,857
I need six extra cases
of beer today,

39
00:03:40,926 --> 00:03:42,757
along with the regular order.

40
00:03:45,898 --> 00:03:48,560
- Business is good at the hotel.
- It is very good.

41
00:03:49,502 --> 00:03:51,766
I'm always glad
to see you, Paul.

42
00:03:58,511 --> 00:04:01,105
Put that back! Put that back!
That's not beer!

43
00:04:06,452 --> 00:04:08,943
- You, clean this up.
- Yes, sir. Come on.

44
00:04:09,021 --> 00:04:11,717
Paul, don't worry
about the Carlsberg.

45
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:14,555
I'll give you Heineken,
and I won't charge you extra.

46
00:04:14,627 --> 00:04:15,616
Thank you.

47
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:23,694
A bargain buy from China--
ten cents each.

48
00:04:24,737 --> 00:04:27,137
You know, I'll get at least fifty.

49
00:04:27,807 --> 00:04:29,104
At least.

50
00:04:36,515 --> 00:04:39,075
George Rutaganda is a bad man.

51
00:04:39,151 --> 00:04:41,984
I've heard him on the radio
telling the Hutus to kill all the Tutsis.

52
00:04:43,422 --> 00:04:46,482
Rutaganda and his people,
they are fools, Dube.

53
00:04:46,559 --> 00:04:48,823
Their time is soon over.

54
00:04:48,894 --> 00:04:50,862
Anyway, this is business.

55
00:04:56,836 --> 00:05:00,465
- Oh, no. It's the hterhamwe.
- Do as they say. Pull over.

56
00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:22,718
No, no, sit up, Dube. Sit up.

57
00:05:22,795 --> 00:05:24,786
Smile, Dube. Don't attract
attention to yourself.

58
00:05:24,864 --> 00:05:28,766
Some of these men are my neighbors.
They know that I'm Tutsi.

59
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:31,359
Just smile as if
they are friends, Dube.

60
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:38,673
- I know this man!
- Are you a Tutsi?

61
00:05:38,744 --> 00:05:40,075
What are you doing here?

62
00:05:40,146 --> 00:05:43,843
No, no. Hutu power.
Hutu power, Hutu power!

63
00:05:45,284 --> 00:05:47,013
Okay. Yes!

64
00:05:51,323 --> 00:05:52,654
Get out of here.

65
00:06:00,966 --> 00:06:02,957
There's water coming from the box.

66
00:06:03,035 --> 00:06:05,196
Park here.
We'll go in the front.

67
00:06:08,641 --> 00:06:10,871
Gregoire, please help with this water.

68
00:06:12,077 --> 00:06:13,374
Gregoire!

69
00:06:13,446 --> 00:06:15,073
Deal with this right away.

70
00:06:15,147 --> 00:06:18,275
- We were hoping to go see the gorilla.
- You must contact our safari desk.

71
00:06:19,885 --> 00:06:22,217
Dube, this is the lobby.

72
00:06:22,288 --> 00:06:24,916
- What's going on?
- I am sorry, sir. It is an emergency.

73
00:06:28,727 --> 00:06:30,957
Oh, shit! Oh, sorry, sir.

74
00:06:34,467 --> 00:06:36,560
Ten alive, twelve are dead.

75
00:06:39,104 --> 00:06:40,264
All right.

76
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,071
But save the shells.

77
00:06:43,142 --> 00:06:44,632
Fill them with...

78
00:06:45,578 --> 00:06:48,741
...a stuffing.
The good meat and something local.

79
00:06:48,814 --> 00:06:52,580
- Cassava?
- And...the fish.

80
00:06:52,651 --> 00:06:54,846
- And tipali.
- Yes.

81
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,686
We'll call it "fresh lobster
in a cassava and tipali crust."

82
00:06:58,757 --> 00:06:59,746
Dube.

83
00:06:59,825 --> 00:07:01,224
Style, sir.

84
00:07:01,293 --> 00:07:02,760
Yes, sir.

85
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:09,694
The problem is, General Bizimungu,
I have information

86
00:07:09,768 --> 00:07:14,967
that the hterhamwe militia
will not heed the peace agreement.

87
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,601
Colonel, the U.N. need not worry
about the hterhamwe.

88
00:07:18,677 --> 00:07:19,905
We will control them.

89
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:22,140
- General.
- Paul.

90
00:07:22,214 --> 00:07:24,307
This scotch is exceptional.

91
00:07:24,383 --> 00:07:28,149
It is our most popular single malt.
I knew you'd like it.

92
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,085
Colonel Oliver,
it is a pleasure to see you, sir.

93
00:07:30,155 --> 00:07:32,146
Good to see you, Paul.

94
00:07:32,758 --> 00:07:35,750
General, let me recommend
the lobster for lunch today.

95
00:07:35,828 --> 00:07:37,796
It is spectacular--
straight off the plane.

96
00:07:37,863 --> 00:07:40,764
Fresh lobster in Kigali.
You do us proud, Paul.

97
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:41,822
Thank you.

98
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:44,802
I left a little something for you
at the coat check.

99
00:07:45,905 --> 00:07:47,304
Excuse me, gentlemen.

100
00:07:49,475 --> 00:07:51,705
I need flour.
Give me two bags of flour.

101
00:07:53,245 --> 00:07:55,338
Okay, the plates are ready.
Here they come.

102
00:07:57,783 --> 00:07:59,444
Good afternoon, ladies.

103
00:07:59,518 --> 00:08:02,078
Elizabeth, please put these
in the general's briefcase.

104
00:08:02,154 --> 00:08:03,451
Yes, sir.

105
00:08:05,257 --> 00:08:06,849
<i>This is RTLM, Hutu Power Radio.</i>

106
00:08:07,426 --> 00:08:10,224
<i>I have a message for our president.</i>

107
00:08:10,296 --> 00:08:14,198
<i>Beware. Do not trust
the Tutsi rebels.</i>

108
00:08:14,266 --> 00:08:16,791
<i>Do not shake the hand

109
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:18,131

<i>...reporting from Kigali, Rwanda,
where tensions are high</i>

111
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:25,204
<i>as the deadline for the U.N.-brokered
peace agreement approaches.</i>

112
00:08:29,715 --> 00:08:31,012
Hello, Mr. Paul.

113
00:08:44,663 --> 00:08:46,221
Hello, Jeremiah.

114
00:08:46,732 --> 00:08:47,892
Hello, sir.

115
00:08:53,305 --> 00:08:55,364
- Good to see you, Paul.
- Odette.

116
00:08:57,109 --> 00:08:58,599
See you soon.

117
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:02,638
So your brother
and the girls are here.

118
00:09:02,715 --> 00:09:03,909
Yes.

119
00:09:05,117 --> 00:09:06,141
One, two, three...

120
00:09:06,218 --> 00:09:08,083
Oh, Carine!

121
00:09:08,754 --> 00:09:10,722
Okay, Anais, let me see.
Your turn.

122
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:12,222
One, two, three...

123
00:09:14,426 --> 00:09:17,190
Who is the winner?
Oh, it doesn't matter.

124
00:09:17,262 --> 00:09:19,025
I have chocolates.
Who wants chocolates?

125
00:09:19,098 --> 00:09:20,224
Hey, Papa, watch this.

126
00:09:23,502 --> 00:09:26,699
Oh, my goodness. Well, here,
chocolates, chocolates. Who wants?

127
00:09:27,272 --> 00:09:29,467
Say thank you to your Uncle Paul.

128
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,635
- Please, not before dinner.
- Not before dinner, Mama says.

129
00:09:32,711 --> 00:09:34,838
- Thank you.
- Okay, okay.

130
00:09:34,913 --> 00:09:36,175
Let's go in.

131
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:45,584
Things are very slow at the shop.
How are things at the hotel?

132
00:09:45,658 --> 00:09:48,821
Very busy.
Many people visiting the gorillas.

133
00:09:48,894 --> 00:09:51,692
A lot of foreign press arriving
for the peace acc--

134
00:09:51,764 --> 00:09:54,289
- What?
- There are soldiers.

135
00:09:54,366 --> 00:09:56,926
- Where?
- On the street.

136
00:10:01,006 --> 00:10:03,839
I'll go see what's happening.
It's all right.

137
00:10:06,745 --> 00:10:10,738
- We know you are Tutsi.
- Please, sir, this is my husband.

138
00:10:10,816 --> 00:10:13,216
- He's just a gardener.
- He's been spying for the rebels.

139
00:10:13,285 --> 00:10:16,049
- No, we do not know any rebels.
- You will come with us!

140
00:10:16,121 --> 00:10:19,147
No, we are telling the truth.
We do not know any...

141
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:21,458
- What is it?
- Shut up!

142
00:10:21,527 --> 00:10:24,189
Tatiana, go back in the house.
You must go back.

143
00:10:24,263 --> 00:10:26,231
- You mustn't be out here.
- It's Victor.

144
00:10:29,101 --> 00:10:31,160
No, Captain, you see--

145
00:10:31,236 --> 00:10:34,364
It's not me. It's not me.
Captain, Captain.

146
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,000
Why are you taking him away?
Please, please.

147
00:10:37,076 --> 00:10:39,510
- I know, I know, but it's not me.
- You Tutsi fuckers.

148
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:42,146
No! No!

149
00:10:42,214 --> 00:10:43,545
We must do something.

150
00:10:43,615 --> 00:10:45,310
- Do what?
- Call someone.

151
00:10:45,384 --> 00:10:48,285
I'm not going. I'm not going.

152
00:10:48,353 --> 00:10:49,377
No!

153
00:10:55,394 --> 00:10:57,589
Get him in the truck. Now!

154
00:10:58,697 --> 00:11:00,392
We must do something.

155
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:02,525
Please help him!

156
00:11:02,601 --> 00:11:05,035
Oh, Victor!

157
00:11:05,604 --> 00:11:06,593
Victor!

158
00:11:06,672 --> 00:11:08,537
There is nothing we can do.

159
00:11:09,575 --> 00:11:12,408
- You must stay the night, Thomas.
- Yes.

160
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,211
No!

161
00:11:19,051 --> 00:11:21,110
Why would they arrest Victor?

162
00:11:23,355 --> 00:11:25,220
He has no politics.

163
00:11:26,058 --> 00:11:28,822
- He's a gardener.
- Who knows, Tatsi?

164
00:11:29,995 --> 00:11:31,155
Who knows?

165
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:35,131
Someone who didn't like him
denounced him as a rebel spy.

166
00:11:36,468 --> 00:11:38,197
Happens all the time now.

167
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:45,167
Maybe you could call
one of your contacts in the army.

168
00:11:45,911 --> 00:11:47,435
It wouldn't help.

169
00:11:49,047 --> 00:11:50,844
You could ask as a favor.

170
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,077
No, I could not.

171
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:59,220
Tatsi, all day long I work
to please this officer,

172
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:03,159
that diplomat, some tourist,
to store up favors

173
00:12:03,228 --> 00:12:05,856
<i>so if there is a time
when we need help,</i>

174
00:12:05,931 --> 00:12:07,990
I have powerful people
I can call upon.

175
00:12:08,066 --> 00:12:10,398
But Victor was a good neighbor.

176
00:12:10,469 --> 00:12:14,769
He is not family.
Family is all that matters.

177
00:12:15,474 --> 00:12:20,639
Please, please,
leave these things to my good judgment.

178
00:12:36,428 --> 00:12:38,760
This assignment is bullshit.

179
00:12:38,831 --> 00:12:41,891
Come on. A few days in a nice hotel,
no one shooting at us?

180
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:47,570
Gentlemen, welcome
to the Mille Collines.

181
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,869
I am Paul Rusesabagina,
the house manager.

182
00:12:49,942 --> 00:12:51,773
- How you doing?
- Nice to meet you.

183
00:12:51,844 --> 00:12:54,039
Anything that you need,
please find me.

184
00:12:54,112 --> 00:12:55,477
- Thank you.
- Certainly.

185
00:13:03,055 --> 00:13:07,116
So, what is the actual difference
between a Hutu and a Tutsi?

186
00:13:07,192 --> 00:13:11,595
According to the Belgian colonists,
the Tutsis are taller and more elegant.

187
00:13:11,663 --> 00:13:14,632
It was the Belgians
that created the division.

188
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,190
How?

189
00:13:16,268 --> 00:13:19,601
They picked people,
those with thinner noses, lighter skin.

190
00:13:19,671 --> 00:13:21,730
They used to measure
the width of people's noses.

191
00:13:21,807 --> 00:13:24,332
The Belgians used the Tutsis
to run the country.

192
00:13:24,409 --> 00:13:26,741
Then when they left,
they left the power to the Hutus,

193
00:13:26,812 --> 00:13:29,076
and of course the Hutus
took revenge

194
00:13:29,147 --> 00:13:31,411
on the elite Tutsis
for years of repression.

195
00:13:31,483 --> 00:13:33,280
Am I telling the truth, Paul?

196
00:13:33,352 --> 00:13:36,685
Yes, unfortunately.
Please take this to the general.

197
00:13:37,856 --> 00:13:41,053
Benedict is our finest journalist
in Kigali, an expert on the subject.

198
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:44,126
So what are you, Paul?

199
00:13:46,798 --> 00:13:48,026
I am Hutu.

200
00:13:48,934 --> 00:13:50,094
Gentlemen.

201
00:13:50,168 --> 00:13:54,730
- More champagne?
- More champagne would be nice.

202
00:13:54,806 --> 00:13:58,105
Excuse me, honey.
Can I ask you a personal question?

203
00:13:58,176 --> 00:14:02,613
- Are you a Hutu or a Tutsi?
- I am Tutsi.

204
00:14:02,681 --> 00:14:06,515
- And your friend? Tutsi?
- No, I am Hutu.

205
00:14:09,254 --> 00:14:10,585
They could be twins.

206
00:14:11,156 --> 00:14:14,319
Get the camera.
The general's going to give us an interview.

207
00:14:14,393 --> 00:14:15,382
Okay.

208
00:14:16,762 --> 00:14:20,664
I'm in room 22. I'd love
to finish up this conversation.

209
00:14:23,535 --> 00:14:27,631
<i>Senior U.N. officers claim that
the Rwandan army is secretly training</i>

210
00:14:27,706 --> 00:14:30,971
<i>and arming the Hutu militia
called the hterhamwe.</i>

211
00:14:31,043 --> 00:14:35,480
<i>I put this claim to the head
of the armed forces, General Bizimungu.</i>

212
00:14:35,547 --> 00:14:39,244
<i>No. No, we have not been
training the militia.</i>

213
00:14:39,318 --> 00:14:41,309
<i>The U.N. are mistaken
in this accusation.</i>

214
00:14:41,386 --> 00:14:43,980
<i>Do you support your president's
agreement to make peace with the rebels?</i>

215
00:14:44,056 --> 00:14:47,514
<i>The president has
the full support of the army.</i>

216
00:14:47,592 --> 00:14:50,584
<i>That peace agreement will
be signed today in Tanzania</i>

217
00:14:50,662 --> 00:14:54,029
<i>between Tutsi rebel forces
and President Habyarimana.</i>

218
00:14:54,099 --> 00:14:56,897
This is a great day for Rwanda

219
00:14:56,969 --> 00:14:58,903
and for all of Africa.

220
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:01,633
Negotiation has replaced confrontation...

221
00:15:01,707 --> 00:15:04,175
Paul, have a drink.

222
00:15:04,242 --> 00:15:06,073
Friendship has replaced fear.

223
00:15:06,144 --> 00:15:08,408
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a live feed

224
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,345
to the signing
of the peace agreement.

225
00:15:10,415 --> 00:15:13,873
To our president.
May he find peace.

226
00:15:14,886 --> 00:15:16,615
May we all find peace.

227
00:15:16,688 --> 00:15:22,388
Let us all dedicate ourselves
to nurturing this hard-earned accord.

228
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:23,723
To peace!

229
00:15:23,795 --> 00:15:24,921
Peace!

230
00:15:27,132 --> 00:15:30,533
- Look me up if you come over.
- Yes, it is a beautiful city.

231
00:15:30,602 --> 00:15:33,127
I am planning on returning there as--
Forgive me.

232
00:15:33,205 --> 00:15:35,298
- Thank you. Bye.
- Thomas.

233
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:39,407
- Hello, Fedens.
- Paul.

234
00:15:39,978 --> 00:15:41,673
Well, this is a surprise.

235
00:15:41,747 --> 00:15:44,147
Forgive us, Paul.
We must talk.

236
00:15:45,017 --> 00:15:46,985
Yes, what's wrong?

237
00:15:47,052 --> 00:15:49,885
I have it from a very
reliable source, Paul.

238
00:15:49,955 --> 00:15:51,081
Who?

239
00:15:52,524 --> 00:15:53,991
Thank you, Sullivan.

240
00:15:55,894 --> 00:15:59,660
My assistant,
the Hutu Power man.

241
00:15:59,731 --> 00:16:02,791
He says that we must get out now,
that soon it'll be very bad.

242
00:16:03,969 --> 00:16:05,402
Give me this man's name.

243
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:09,065
Please, Paul, even though
he is hterhamwe, he's a friend.

244
00:16:09,141 --> 00:16:10,938
He wants your job, Thomas.

245
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,211
He said that
there is a signal.

246
00:16:19,384 --> 00:16:21,909
It is "Cut the tall trees."

247
00:16:22,754 --> 00:16:25,746
And when they hear this signal,
the militia are to go to war.

248
00:16:25,824 --> 00:16:29,760
Paul, please, let us
take Tatiana with us.

249
00:16:29,828 --> 00:16:31,796
You are Hutu.
You will be safe.

250
00:16:32,998 --> 00:16:36,900
Fedens, I know you
have heard many things.

251
00:16:37,869 --> 00:16:39,860
And I know
what we have seen, Thomas.

252
00:16:39,938 --> 00:16:42,668
But please, the United Nations
are here now.

253
00:16:42,741 --> 00:16:45,301
The world press are watching.

254
00:16:45,377 --> 00:16:48,210
The peace has been signed.
Let this process work--

255
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,838
What was that?

256
00:16:54,086 --> 00:16:55,417
Power cuts.

257
00:16:56,721 --> 00:16:58,916
We are running on generators.

258
00:16:59,925 --> 00:17:01,859
Fedens...

259
00:17:01,927 --> 00:17:03,554
Please, don't worry.

260
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:09,466
Tomorrow you will come by the house
and we will discuss this with Tatiana.

261
00:17:09,534 --> 00:17:10,865
All right?

262
00:17:13,505 --> 00:17:16,565
- Good night, Paul.
- Yes. Kiss the girls for me.

263
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,367
Shit!

264
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:03,488
Stay in your houses.
Stay in your house.

265
00:18:03,555 --> 00:18:05,682
Everybody stay in your house!

266
00:18:37,355 --> 00:18:38,515
Tatiana?

267
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,615
- Paul!
- Tatiana!

268
00:19:12,224 --> 00:19:14,886
- What is going on here?
- Our house has been burned.

269
00:19:15,427 --> 00:19:17,793
- Didn't you hear the news?
- What news?

270
00:19:17,862 --> 00:19:21,161
They are saying President Habyarimana
has been murdered.

271
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:23,030
Tutsi rebels have killed him.

272
00:19:23,101 --> 00:19:26,559
Nonsense. Why would the rebels kill
the president when he agreed to peace?

273
00:19:29,841 --> 00:19:32,571
Everyone, please,
out of this room. Please.

274
00:19:32,644 --> 00:19:34,635
Jean Baptiste, find them seats
in the other room.

275
00:19:34,713 --> 00:19:36,510
Odette, please.

276
00:19:39,884 --> 00:19:44,014
- Did you meet with Thomas and Fedens?
- Yes. I told them to go home.

277
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:48,584
- Go and call them, Tatsi.
- I've tried. Our phones, they do not work.

278
00:19:52,998 --> 00:19:56,957
- Why do the neighbors run to us?
- You are the only Hutu they can trust.

279
00:19:57,035 --> 00:19:58,627
You are a Tutsi.

280
00:19:58,703 --> 00:20:02,002
They are scared, Paul.
I am scared.

281
00:20:08,313 --> 00:20:11,146
These are probably rumors
started by agitators.

282
00:20:11,216 --> 00:20:14,049
We must remain calm
for the children, Tatsi. We must.

283
00:20:14,552 --> 00:20:18,079
Forgive me, Paul.
Elys says that Roger has gone.

284
00:20:18,156 --> 00:20:20,420
Gone? Gone where?

285
00:20:20,492 --> 00:20:24,189
- He was afraid for his friend Simon, Mama.
- Where has he gone, Elys?

286
00:20:24,262 --> 00:20:25,388
He went next door.

287
00:20:26,298 --> 00:20:28,129
Wait. Paul!

288
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:31,225
Tatiana, no. You have to
stay here with the children.

289
00:20:31,303 --> 00:20:33,203
- Stay in the house. No!
- Please.

290
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:44,571
Paul, please, what is wrong?
Tell me, what is wrong?

291
00:20:44,649 --> 00:20:47,618
- Oh, my son! Where are you hurt?
- Is he okay? Oh, my baby!

292
00:20:47,686 --> 00:20:49,813
Talk to me.
Where are you hurt?

293
00:20:49,888 --> 00:20:50,946
Paul?

294
00:20:53,591 --> 00:20:54,751
Oh, Tatsi.

295
00:20:57,128 --> 00:20:59,119
Odette, Odette!

296
00:20:59,197 --> 00:21:00,186
Oh, no.

297
00:21:00,265 --> 00:21:01,698
I'm okay.

298
00:21:01,766 --> 00:21:04,166
Get his clothes off.
Tatsi, please get some water.

299
00:21:04,235 --> 00:21:06,465
- He's hurt.
- Please, let's get his clothes off.

300
00:21:06,538 --> 00:21:08,938
- He's covered in blood.
- Lay back, son.

301
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:12,700
He went next door
to the Chirangas.

302
00:21:13,611 --> 00:21:15,340
Where is he hurt?

303
00:21:15,947 --> 00:21:18,006
Look here, Odette, look here.

304
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,711
Stay still, Roger.
Keep him still, Paul.

305
00:21:21,553 --> 00:21:24,113
- I can't find the wound.
- What happened to you?

306
00:21:24,189 --> 00:21:25,588
- Tell your mother.
- Talk to me.

307
00:21:25,657 --> 00:21:27,818
Tell your mother
what happened, Roger.

308
00:21:27,892 --> 00:21:29,325
Roger, you're okay.

309
00:21:29,394 --> 00:21:33,160
Do not worry, he is not cut.
He is not hurt.

310
00:21:33,231 --> 00:21:35,665
This is not his blood, Paul.

311
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:38,332
You are not hurt.

312
00:21:38,403 --> 00:21:41,861
My darling, it's okay.
It's okay.

313
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,805
You are safe.
Look at your mother.

314
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:45,934
Come here, Elys.

315
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:49,502
- Where did the blood come from?
- Please, please!

316
00:21:50,415 --> 00:21:52,349
- You are safe.
- You are out, Roger.

317
00:21:52,417 --> 00:21:55,147
You are safe, you are safe, Roger.
You are safe, Roger.

318
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,915
It's okay.

319
00:21:56,988 --> 00:21:59,149
I love you so much.
I love you.

320
00:22:19,043 --> 00:22:20,305
Oh, son.

321
00:22:24,816 --> 00:22:26,215
Paul.

322
00:22:26,284 --> 00:22:31,813
<i>Listen to me, good people of Rwanda.
Terrible news...</i>

323
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:34,882
<i>- It is true.
- Horrible news...</i>

324
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:39,658
<i>Our great president
is murdered by the Tutsi cockroaches.</i>

325
00:22:39,731 --> 00:22:40,720
Oh, my God!

326
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,633
<i>They tricked him to sign
their phony peace agreement.</i>

327
00:22:44,702 --> 00:22:47,330
<i>Then they shot his plane
from the sky.</i>

328
00:22:48,306 --> 00:22:52,675
<i>It is time to clear the brush,
good Hutus of Rwanda.</i>

329
00:22:53,778 --> 00:22:56,611
<i>We must cut the tall trees.</i>

330
00:22:57,282 --> 00:23:00,115
<i>Cut the tall trees now!</i>

331
00:23:00,185 --> 00:23:01,675
The soldiers are here!

332
00:23:01,753 --> 00:23:04,722
<i>- Let us go to work, loyal Hutus.
- No, no.</i>

333
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:07,349
Everyone, stay calm.
Stay calm and be quiet.

334
00:23:07,425 --> 00:23:11,885
<i>Find these traitors.
Let none of them escape.</i>

335
00:23:12,797 --> 00:23:15,527
Split up.
Everybody out.

336
00:23:17,635 --> 00:23:20,103
- You two, check the back.
- Go.

337
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,206
- You, go and find him.
- Yes, sir.

338
00:23:30,482 --> 00:23:32,450
I better go have a word with them.

339
00:23:33,852 --> 00:23:36,514
Go around the back.
Make sure no one comes out.

340
00:23:36,588 --> 00:23:37,612
Yes, sir!

341
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,385
Who's in charge here?

342
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:42,619
You.

343
00:23:48,566 --> 00:23:51,467
- Can I help you, sir?
- Everybody out! Out!

344
00:23:51,536 --> 00:23:54,437
- Let me see your identity card.
- Grab your things. Go!

345
00:23:54,506 --> 00:23:56,565
I am a good friend
of General Bizimungu.

346
00:23:56,641 --> 00:23:57,733
Get out!

347
00:24:01,346 --> 00:24:03,246
Get out of here!

348
00:24:03,314 --> 00:24:05,714
Everybody, out!
Get out, get out!

349
00:24:05,783 --> 00:24:07,307
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?

350
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,649
No, I work at the Mille Collines.

351
00:24:12,323 --> 00:24:14,154
I used to work at the Diplomat.

352
00:24:14,225 --> 00:24:16,955
We want to use that hotel.
All the room keys are in the safe.

353
00:24:17,028 --> 00:24:19,462
You must open it.
Let's go.

354
00:24:19,531 --> 00:24:23,092
- Paul!
- Sir, I cannot leave my family.

355
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:25,863
I must take them with me.
It is not safe here.

356
00:24:25,937 --> 00:24:28,132
There are Tutsi spies everywhere.

357
00:24:28,206 --> 00:24:29,833
I cannot take all these people.

358
00:24:29,908 --> 00:24:31,899
No, no, sir,
you do not have to.

359
00:24:31,976 --> 00:24:34,774
We have our car
and our van.

360
00:24:34,846 --> 00:24:37,542
<i>- Captain Kaliso, come on.
- Roger.</i>

361
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:42,076
- Let's go!
- Come on. Hurry! Go around, go around.

362
00:24:42,153 --> 00:24:44,451
We found him.
Let's go. Let's go!

363
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:49,223
- Can I go with you?
- Yes, of course, Jeremiah. Hurry.

364
00:24:59,537 --> 00:25:01,061
Oh, Jesus, no!

365
00:25:03,007 --> 00:25:04,497
Oh, it's Simon, Papa!

366
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:08,773
Don't look, don't look, don't look.
Don't look, Tatiana.

367
00:26:13,177 --> 00:26:16,078
- The safe is in the manager's office.
- You two, go with him.

368
00:26:24,422 --> 00:26:26,788
Look at this. Beer.

369
00:26:43,941 --> 00:26:45,203
I've got them.

370
00:26:56,888 --> 00:26:58,378
Get down, all of you!

371
00:27:04,295 --> 00:27:08,288
Sir, sir. Here, I have them.
I have them. I've got them.

372
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,801
Traitor!

373
00:27:14,872 --> 00:27:16,840
These are Tutsi cockroaches!

374
00:27:17,508 --> 00:27:19,942
Let me explain, sir.
Please wait.

375
00:27:23,247 --> 00:27:24,407
Shoot them.

376
00:27:25,783 --> 00:27:27,011
Shoot them.

377
00:27:28,853 --> 00:27:32,448
Please, I don't use guns.
I don't.

378
00:27:32,523 --> 00:27:33,512
It's easy.

379
00:27:38,496 --> 00:27:41,829
Shoot them, or you die first.

380
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:46,431
Sir, what could I pay you
not to do this?

381
00:27:46,504 --> 00:27:48,335
You wanna pay me?

382
00:27:48,406 --> 00:27:50,806
Why not?
Look at them.

383
00:27:50,875 --> 00:27:52,672
These are not rebels.

384
00:27:53,678 --> 00:27:57,136
Soon they will be worthless to you.
Why not take some money for your work?

385
00:27:57,215 --> 00:27:59,843
- How much?
- You name a price.

386
00:28:07,658 --> 00:28:09,421
10,000 francs for each.

387
00:28:10,328 --> 00:28:12,990
- Sir, I don't have that much.
- Okay.

388
00:28:13,064 --> 00:28:15,032
Wait, wait! Here.

389
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:18,535
It's 1,000 U.S.
And here.

390
00:28:19,237 --> 00:28:22,070
50,000 francs for my wife and children.

391
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,370
- Take them.
- Go, go, go.

392
00:28:24,442 --> 00:28:26,842
Go, go, go.

393
00:28:26,911 --> 00:28:28,811
- Have you any money?
- Nothing.

394
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,111
- Paul, don't let them die.
- Get in the van.

395
00:28:37,188 --> 00:28:40,021
Sir, I have more money actually.

396
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:45,258
And let them give you something.
Some money, whatever they have.

397
00:28:45,329 --> 00:28:46,489
All right?

398
00:28:47,999 --> 00:28:50,194
Here you are.
Give me everything you have.

399
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:54,201
Here, Paul, it's all I have.

400
00:28:57,175 --> 00:28:59,370
Here you are. See?

401
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,271
This is enough for one cockroach.
Pick one.

402
00:29:05,917 --> 00:29:07,077
Sir...

403
00:29:09,253 --> 00:29:12,586
I will give you 100,000 francs
for all of them.

404
00:29:14,592 --> 00:29:16,526
- Give me it.
- I don't have it here.

405
00:29:16,594 --> 00:29:18,585
At the Mille Collines
I can get it for you.

406
00:29:18,663 --> 00:29:21,131
You'll run into the hotel
and hide behind the U.N.

407
00:29:21,199 --> 00:29:25,863
Sir, I swear.
100,000 francs.

408
00:29:25,937 --> 00:29:29,464
I will get you the money.
You keep them outside.

409
00:29:32,076 --> 00:29:34,237
Please, sir. Please.

410
00:29:35,646 --> 00:29:38,137
- Let's go.
- Okay. Everyone in the van.

411
00:29:38,216 --> 00:29:40,013
Come on now. Hurry.

412
00:29:51,729 --> 00:29:55,529
Go with my soldiers. And hurry back
if you want to keep these cockroaches.

413
00:30:00,171 --> 00:30:02,935
The soldiers are here.
Where is the car?

414
00:30:03,007 --> 00:30:06,340
There is nothing I can do.
Excuse me, sir! Please, could you--

415
00:30:18,723 --> 00:30:20,054
Here's the money.

416
00:30:20,124 --> 00:30:22,615
100,000 francs as promised.

417
00:30:22,693 --> 00:30:24,661
Now please, let them go, sir.

418
00:30:24,729 --> 00:30:26,959
Take the money.
We will get them later.

419
00:30:29,834 --> 00:30:31,995
- You can go.
- Thank you.

420
00:30:34,038 --> 00:30:35,198
Traitor.

421
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,072
Thank you, Paul.

422
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:49,417
Do you understand, Dube?
Because I can't wait for Paul.

423
00:30:49,487 --> 00:30:51,853
- You must tell him when he comes--
- Here he is, sir.

424
00:30:53,357 --> 00:30:57,418
Paul, I have to go.
The staff of Kivu Lodge have fled.

425
00:30:57,495 --> 00:31:00,464
I have to close up there.
You are in charge now.

426
00:31:00,531 --> 00:31:01,657
It's okay, it's okay.

427
00:31:01,732 --> 00:31:05,498
<i>There were no survivors in last night's
plane crash in Kigali, Rwanda.</i>

428
00:31:05,569 --> 00:31:08,402
Everyone, please move to the side.
Clear the door.

429
00:31:08,472 --> 00:31:09,803
Come, Tatsi.

430
00:31:12,143 --> 00:31:14,373
Andre, I need two suites.

431
00:31:14,445 --> 00:31:16,743
- Paul, please, where is my passport?
- Yes, I understand.

432
00:31:16,814 --> 00:31:21,012
- I need to get hold of my embassy.
- If you give me one moment, please.

433
00:31:22,386 --> 00:31:26,049
- Odette, Jean Baptiste, take this room.
- What about our neighbors?

434
00:31:27,291 --> 00:31:28,781
What will they do?

435
00:31:31,362 --> 00:31:33,694
- Dube.
- Yes, sir?

436
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:39,733
Please...put these "guests"
in two staff rooms.

437
00:31:39,804 --> 00:31:41,271
Right away, sir.

438
00:31:50,014 --> 00:31:53,108
No, no, no. Please, it's old.
Have the fruit.

439
00:31:57,021 --> 00:31:59,683
It's all right, Roger.
It's all right. We're here.

440
00:32:00,958 --> 00:32:02,619
- Ah, Joseph.
- Your suit, sir.

441
00:32:02,693 --> 00:32:04,058
This mess is unacceptable.

442
00:32:04,128 --> 00:32:07,188
Call housekeeping, get them
up here right away. Thank you.

443
00:32:09,233 --> 00:32:11,497
- I'm trying Thomas and Fedens.
- All right.

444
00:32:14,205 --> 00:32:16,696
Operator, I need a line.

445
00:32:16,774 --> 00:32:19,641
I need a line now. Please. Hello?

446
00:32:24,448 --> 00:32:26,609
You did not reach them?

447
00:32:26,684 --> 00:32:28,879
No. No answer.

448
00:32:30,388 --> 00:32:34,051
<i>It is a very tense situation,
and I just want to assure the families</i>

449
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:37,253
<i>of those who are there that we are
doing everything we possibly can</i>

450
00:32:37,328 --> 00:32:39,888
<i>to try to ensure
the safety of our citizens there.</i>

451
00:32:39,964 --> 00:32:42,194
Can you at least tell us,
is the airport actually open?

452
00:32:42,266 --> 00:32:44,962
We are calling the airport.
We are calling the embassy.

453
00:32:45,036 --> 00:32:47,596
We are trying to get as much
information for you as we can.

454
00:32:47,671 --> 00:32:49,571
- And yes, your passport, yes.
- And my passport.

455
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,972
Antoinette will take care
of this for you.

456
00:32:53,844 --> 00:32:56,244
Dube, where is Gregoire?

457
00:32:58,716 --> 00:33:02,117
Sir, he has moved
into the Presidential Suite.

458
00:33:16,801 --> 00:33:17,961
Mr. Manager.

459
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:21,929
What do you think
you are doing, Gregoire?

460
00:33:22,006 --> 00:33:23,371
Who is it?

461
00:33:24,108 --> 00:33:25,575
It's okay, darling.

462
00:33:26,377 --> 00:33:27,708
What do you want?

463
00:33:27,778 --> 00:33:31,305
You had better get out of this room
and back downstairs right away.

464
00:33:31,382 --> 00:33:34,647
- I don't have to listen to you anymore.
- Yes, you do.

465
00:33:34,718 --> 00:33:37,915
I am in charge. Now get out
of this room right now.

466
00:33:43,961 --> 00:33:48,557
Mr. Manager, do you notice
the smell of cockroaches?

467
00:33:50,067 --> 00:33:53,127
If I were to leave this room,
I'm sure I could find it.

468
00:33:53,904 --> 00:33:56,395
And I know people
who can cleanse it.

469
00:33:57,641 --> 00:34:01,372
But maybe it doesn't bother you.
Why is that?

470
00:34:02,746 --> 00:34:04,577
Are you used to the smell?

471
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,481
Well, not me.

472
00:34:08,486 --> 00:34:10,818
I need a clean room
to escape it.

473
00:34:17,094 --> 00:34:20,860
Please move into the hotel.
Everyone, keep moving.

474
00:34:20,931 --> 00:34:23,229
My house has been burned.
I have nowhere to go.

475
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,892
Yes, I understand this, Your Honor.

476
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:27,199
But we are operating
at capacity as it is.

477
00:34:27,271 --> 00:34:31,105
I can give you one room,
but you will have to share it. I'm sorry.

478
00:34:31,175 --> 00:34:33,803
- There's no way we can share.
- I am sorry. Forgive me.

479
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:35,345
There are eight of us.

480
00:34:35,412 --> 00:34:36,970
- Yes?
- Paul, I need your help.

481
00:34:37,047 --> 00:34:38,207
Yes, Madame Archer.

482
00:34:45,656 --> 00:34:48,523
They're Tutsi children
from the St. Francis orphanage.

483
00:34:49,093 --> 00:34:50,754
Okay, come on, let's go.

484
00:34:51,428 --> 00:34:54,295
- I have only one room.
- That'll do.

485
00:34:56,634 --> 00:34:58,067
Come.

486
00:34:58,135 --> 00:35:00,535
- Otto, please.
- Excuse me.

487
00:35:01,605 --> 00:35:04,574
Corporal, take that lady's bag, please,
and quickly.

488
00:35:07,278 --> 00:35:10,679
- Have to go get the rest of them.
- The rest of them?

489
00:35:10,748 --> 00:35:13,114
There are another ten.
I'll be back soon.

490
00:35:15,686 --> 00:35:17,620
Madame Archer.

491
00:35:17,688 --> 00:35:19,451
I have a favor to ask of you.

492
00:35:19,523 --> 00:35:23,050
My brother-in-law and his family,
they live near the St. Francis.

493
00:35:23,127 --> 00:35:25,220
On O'Clare, 20.

494
00:35:25,296 --> 00:35:28,288
Can you please get them
and bring them here to me?

495
00:35:28,365 --> 00:35:30,390
- Sure.
- And I have a photo.

496
00:35:32,403 --> 00:35:34,098
Please, keep moving!

497
00:35:37,808 --> 00:35:39,469
- Thanks, Paul.
- Thank you.

498
00:35:39,543 --> 00:35:41,408
Please move into the hotel!

499
00:35:41,478 --> 00:35:43,105
Come on, kids, don't be afraid.

500
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,876
- Take them around the back.
- Everyone, keep moving!

501
00:35:51,789 --> 00:35:54,189
Has he spoken to you yet?

502
00:35:54,258 --> 00:35:55,247
No.

503
00:36:09,006 --> 00:36:11,031
Is your face still hurting?

504
00:36:12,076 --> 00:36:13,236
It's all right.

505
00:36:19,783 --> 00:36:22,513
The neighbors asked me
to thank you for your kindness.

506
00:36:25,256 --> 00:36:27,315
I shouldn't have brought them here.

507
00:36:29,326 --> 00:36:32,659
The first thing they told me
when I received my appointment

508
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:35,563
was to never, never lower
the tone of the hotel.

509
00:36:36,967 --> 00:36:39,868
"Maintain the Mille Collines' dignity
at all times, Paul."

510
00:36:44,675 --> 00:36:46,666
Soon all of this will be over.

511
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:51,340
What if I lose my job, Tatsi?

512
00:36:54,318 --> 00:36:55,376
Oh, my God!

513
00:36:55,452 --> 00:36:57,647
- Where are you going?
- I'll be right back.

514
00:37:17,741 --> 00:37:19,675
Take care of them.

515
00:37:19,743 --> 00:37:21,074
How, sir?

516
00:37:22,413 --> 00:37:24,904
Bathe them, feed them.

517
00:37:26,317 --> 00:37:27,648
Put them to bed.

518
00:37:30,754 --> 00:37:32,415
I will send you some help.

519
00:37:37,294 --> 00:37:39,023
Okay, babies.

520
00:37:39,363 --> 00:37:41,627
We have heard reports
of reprisal massacres.

521
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:44,190
Will the U.N. intervene
to stop the bloodshed?

522
00:37:44,268 --> 00:37:47,396
We're here as peacekeepers,
not as peacemakers.

523
00:37:47,471 --> 00:37:50,099
My orders are
not to intervene.

524
00:37:51,075 --> 00:37:52,975
- Excuse me.
- Thank you, Colonel.

525
00:37:53,677 --> 00:37:54,769
Here. Over here.

526
00:37:54,845 --> 00:37:57,973
Listen, I got us a car,
but we gotta move now.

527
00:37:58,716 --> 00:38:00,308
We're not allowed
to do that, Jack.

528
00:38:00,384 --> 00:38:03,785
David, the shit's going down outside
these walls. We gotta cover it.

529
00:38:03,854 --> 00:38:06,982
We're not leaving the hotel grounds
unless we have an armored car.

530
00:38:07,057 --> 00:38:09,218
- That's the ground rules.
- The ground rules?

531
00:38:09,293 --> 00:38:11,124
Where do you think we are,
fucking Wimbledon?

532
00:38:11,195 --> 00:38:16,189
We cover the story from here
until we get the proper vehicles, Jack.

533
00:38:16,266 --> 00:38:18,700
Shoot some "B" roll of the refugees.

534
00:38:24,408 --> 00:38:25,636
Let's go.

535
00:38:25,709 --> 00:38:28,337
Colonel, I have no way
to protect these people.

536
00:38:28,412 --> 00:38:31,279
And I have more refugees
than I have room for as it is.

537
00:38:31,348 --> 00:38:34,784
I was given 20 orphans today
by the Red Cross.

538
00:38:34,852 --> 00:38:36,911
This is not a refugee camp.

539
00:38:36,987 --> 00:38:39,182
Can you not take them with you
to your facilities?

540
00:38:39,256 --> 00:38:42,521
No, I can't do that, Paul.
I'm sorry.

541
00:38:43,427 --> 00:38:46,157
I'm overwhelmed
at my refugee camp.

542
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,824
I'm under attack, constant attack.

543
00:38:48,899 --> 00:38:52,801
As soon as we can stabilize
this situation, then I'll take 'em.

544
00:38:55,739 --> 00:39:00,438
<i>...and stop the Tutsi cockroaches
who try to run from justice.</i>

545
00:39:00,511 --> 00:39:05,039
<i>The Tutsi cockroach judge
called Makesa is hiding at 4...</i>

546
00:39:07,684 --> 00:39:12,018
<i>- ...Kabulla and his cockroaches...
- Turn that radio off.</i>

547
00:39:12,823 --> 00:39:14,518
<i>Watch out for him. He--</i>

548
00:39:16,927 --> 00:39:20,693
And get back to work.
We have a hotel to run.

549
00:39:20,764 --> 00:39:23,961
There's no work here anyway.
The boss has left.

550
00:39:24,034 --> 00:39:25,729
I am your boss!

551
00:39:39,149 --> 00:39:43,142
<i>Sir, there's a call from the Mille Collines
in Rwanda on line one.</i>

552
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,780
Yes? Who am I speaking to?

553
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:50,051
Yes, sir, Paul Rusesabagina,
the house manager.

554
00:39:50,127 --> 00:39:52,220
I met you on your last visit here,
Mr. Tillens.

555
00:39:52,296 --> 00:39:55,060
Ah, yes. Paul, I remember.

556
00:39:55,132 --> 00:39:56,895
How are things there?

557
00:39:56,967 --> 00:39:59,265
<i>The situation is difficult, sir.</i>

558
00:40:00,637 --> 00:40:04,801
Some of our directors believe
we should close the Mille Collines

559
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:06,900
until this unrest is over.

560
00:40:06,977 --> 00:40:10,606
<i>I'm not sure about that, Paul.
What do you think?</i>

561
00:40:13,116 --> 00:40:17,348
Sir, that would be
very bad for our reputation.

562
00:40:17,421 --> 00:40:21,687
The Mille Collines is an oasis of calm
for all our loyal customers.

563
00:40:21,758 --> 00:40:24,989
What would they think
if Sabena deserted them now?

564
00:40:25,062 --> 00:40:28,156
I assure you, the United Nations
have everything under control, sir.

565
00:40:29,666 --> 00:40:31,566
Very well, Paul.
Very well.

566
00:40:31,635 --> 00:40:35,571
But if this thing gets worse,
we must close.

567
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:38,938
If there is anything
I can do, please call.

568
00:40:39,576 --> 00:40:43,068
Sir, yes, there is one thing I'm going
to be needing from you right away.

569
00:40:44,414 --> 00:40:48,009
Let me tell you, it was an embarrassment
for me to have to ask for this.

570
00:40:48,819 --> 00:40:52,983
Most of us in this room have known each
other and worked together for many years.

571
00:40:54,124 --> 00:40:58,117
Is it really necessary
for me to get a letter from Belgium

572
00:40:58,195 --> 00:40:59,924
for you to perform your duties?

573
00:41:04,501 --> 00:41:07,493
In fact, forget this letter.

574
00:41:07,571 --> 00:41:11,632
If you don't want to work for me and would
rather be out there, then leave now.

575
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,475
Please, everyone, back to work.

576
00:41:26,256 --> 00:41:28,315
Paul, thank you for coming.

577
00:41:28,392 --> 00:41:31,919
The air conditioner's on the blink. Is
there any way you can have a look at it?

578
00:41:31,995 --> 00:41:33,860
- I'm just on a deadline.
- Certainly.

579
00:41:33,931 --> 00:41:38,129
Fred, let me know when you
get the satellite feed. Thanks.

580
00:41:38,735 --> 00:41:42,694
Mr. Fleming, I brought you
some tea as well, sir.

581
00:41:42,773 --> 00:41:44,206
Thank you, Paul.

582
00:41:45,475 --> 00:41:47,773
You're an oasis in the desert.

583
00:41:49,179 --> 00:41:51,340
<i>...the elements of
the government and army</i>

584
00:41:51,415 --> 00:41:55,146
<i>are following the example of what
happened to the Americans in Somalia.</i>

585
00:41:55,218 --> 00:42:01,088
<i>I think they intend to intimidate us,
try to attack us, and...</i>

586
00:42:01,158 --> 00:42:04,787
<i>hope that the West
will pull all its troops out.</i>

587
00:42:04,861 --> 00:42:07,261
<i>- Do you think they'll succeed?
- No, they won't.</i>

588
00:42:07,331 --> 00:42:08,730
<i>The U.N.'s here to stay.</i>

589
00:42:08,799 --> 00:42:10,460
<i>What about
the outbreak of violence</i>

590
00:42:10,534 --> 00:42:12,502
<i>since the shooting down
of the president's plane?</i>

591
00:42:12,569 --> 00:42:15,367
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

592
00:42:15,439 --> 00:42:18,499
I'm responsible
for the safety of this crew.

593
00:42:21,078 --> 00:42:22,375
What is this?

594
00:42:52,476 --> 00:42:55,309
- Where did you get this?
- Half a mile down the road.

595
00:42:55,912 --> 00:42:57,709
Fred, it's David.

596
00:42:57,781 --> 00:43:00,614
I've got incredible footage.
It's a massacre.

597
00:43:00,684 --> 00:43:03,380
Dead bodies, machetes.

598
00:43:03,453 --> 00:43:06,581
If I get this through right away,
can you make the evening news?

599
00:43:07,557 --> 00:43:08,649
Yeah.

600
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:15,625
You have to lead with this.

601
00:43:16,867 --> 00:43:18,926
I point at you, you do a shot.

602
00:43:19,002 --> 00:43:22,995
And you'll get a total double
and see if all the drinking--

603
00:43:23,073 --> 00:43:25,098
- Excuse me, Mr. Daglish.
- Hey, Paul.

604
00:43:25,876 --> 00:43:28,936
Listen, sorry about earlier.

605
00:43:29,012 --> 00:43:31,640
If I'd known you were in there,
I wouldn't have--

606
00:43:31,715 --> 00:43:36,516
I am glad that you have shot this footage
and that the world will see it.

607
00:43:36,586 --> 00:43:39,680
It is the only way we have
a chance that people might intervene.

608
00:43:42,959 --> 00:43:47,293
Yeah, and if no one intervenes,
is it still a good thing to show?

609
00:43:49,066 --> 00:43:53,002
How can they not intervene
when they witness such atrocities?

610
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:57,439
I think if people see this footage...

611
00:43:58,542 --> 00:44:01,136
...they'll say, "Oh, my God,
that's horrible,"

612
00:44:01,211 --> 00:44:03,042
and then go on
eating their dinners.

613
00:44:07,784 --> 00:44:10,947
What the hell do I know?
Listen, you wanna just relax?

614
00:44:11,021 --> 00:44:13,683
I have more work to do.
I thank you for your offer.

615
00:44:13,757 --> 00:44:15,987
Please enjoy your evening,
Mr. Daglish.

616
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:22,965
- Help! Please help us! Please!
- Sir! Sir!

617
00:44:23,033 --> 00:44:25,058
We've got trouble at the gate.

618
00:44:27,804 --> 00:44:30,432
Can we have some
medical assistance here, please?

619
00:44:30,507 --> 00:44:33,704
That group, come with me.
Move out of the area.

620
00:44:33,777 --> 00:44:36,007
- Here, get up, get up.
- Right, fall back, everybody.

621
00:44:37,114 --> 00:44:39,105
Benedict, what is happening?

622
00:44:39,182 --> 00:44:42,117
They're killing everyone.
The lady...

623
00:44:42,185 --> 00:44:44,949
The hterhamwe have surrounded
the whole town.

624
00:44:45,021 --> 00:44:46,181
Come on!

625
00:44:46,723 --> 00:44:48,714
Cover the road. Now.

626
00:44:49,593 --> 00:44:51,151
Stand your ground.

627
00:44:53,063 --> 00:44:54,121
Hold the line.

628
00:44:54,197 --> 00:44:56,563
Do not shoot!
Do not shoot!

629
00:45:23,093 --> 00:45:25,755
- Lieutenant, guard this gate.
- Yes, sir.

630
00:45:26,263 --> 00:45:29,232
You two, take up positions
behind those sandbags.

631
00:45:29,299 --> 00:45:34,464
They murdered my men.
I lost ten Belgian U.N. soldiers.

632
00:45:34,538 --> 00:45:36,972
They were protecting
the lady prime minister.

633
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,167
- She is dead?
- Yeah, she's dead.

634
00:45:40,577 --> 00:45:44,172
The Europeans are putting together
an intervention force.

635
00:45:44,247 --> 00:45:45,737
They'll be here in a few days.

636
00:45:45,816 --> 00:45:49,513
I understand that, Colonel, but there is
simply no place for me to put all of them.

637
00:45:49,586 --> 00:45:50,951
What can I do?

638
00:45:51,021 --> 00:45:54,388
I'll put two more men on the gate,
two of my best lieutenants.

639
00:45:55,225 --> 00:45:56,624
- All right.
- All right.

640
00:45:56,693 --> 00:45:58,490
I understand. Thank you.

641
00:46:08,305 --> 00:46:09,567
Madame Archer.

642
00:46:10,841 --> 00:46:11,933
Hello.

643
00:46:13,076 --> 00:46:16,239
- We were expecting you five days ago.
- I'm sorry.

644
00:46:16,313 --> 00:46:18,804
My brother and his family,
did you find them?

645
00:46:18,882 --> 00:46:21,612
I made it to the house,
but it was empty.

646
00:46:21,685 --> 00:46:24,245
- Empty?
- It had been ransacked.

647
00:46:25,488 --> 00:46:28,651
As I left, an old woman,
she waved to me.

648
00:46:28,725 --> 00:46:32,752
I went to the house. She has
the two little girls. They're safe.

649
00:46:32,829 --> 00:46:34,387
Okay.

650
00:46:34,464 --> 00:46:36,227
But...

651
00:46:36,299 --> 00:46:40,702
My brother and his wife--
did the old lady know of them?

652
00:46:43,907 --> 00:46:47,843
My brother is dead.
They would never leave their children.

653
00:46:47,911 --> 00:46:51,438
Perhaps they could not make it
home, Tatiana. They are hiding.

654
00:46:52,983 --> 00:46:56,009
Please, can you return
and bring the girls back here to us?

655
00:46:56,086 --> 00:46:59,817
I can't. There are
hterhamwe roadblocks everywhere.

656
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,551
When I reached the orphanage...

657
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:08,764
...the hterhamwe were there.

658
00:47:09,733 --> 00:47:12,566
They'd already started
killing children.

659
00:47:13,303 --> 00:47:14,964
They made me watch.

660
00:47:17,908 --> 00:47:19,899
There was one girl,

661
00:47:19,976 --> 00:47:22,604
she had her little sister
wrapped on her back.

662
00:47:26,483 --> 00:47:29,577
As they were about to chop her,
she cried out to me.

663
00:47:32,088 --> 00:47:34,079
"Please don't let them kill me.

664
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:38,020
I promise I won't be Tutsi anymore."

665
00:47:38,094 --> 00:47:40,858
Please, I can't.

666
00:47:48,238 --> 00:47:52,402
They're targeting Tutsi children, Paul,
to wipe out the next generation.

667
00:48:00,817 --> 00:48:03,980
I've nowhere to take
the orphans, Paul.

668
00:48:04,054 --> 00:48:08,514
Don't worry. There will be
an intervention force coming soon.

669
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:11,686
We will get the orphans out then.

670
00:48:24,674 --> 00:48:25,936
They're here!

671
00:48:31,815 --> 00:48:34,682
They're here! We are safe!

672
00:48:34,751 --> 00:48:36,082
Soldiers have arrived!

673
00:48:36,686 --> 00:48:39,348
- Wow, look, it's the French!
- Yes!

674
00:48:39,422 --> 00:48:41,253
Thank goodness!

675
00:48:42,759 --> 00:48:44,693
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

676
00:48:44,761 --> 00:48:45,921
Well done.

677
00:48:49,366 --> 00:48:50,833
About time, gentlemen.

678
00:48:52,135 --> 00:48:54,035
Thank you for saving our lives.

679
00:48:58,341 --> 00:48:59,603
It's okay, Roger.

680
00:49:01,878 --> 00:49:05,712
Jean Baptiste, our prayers
have been answered. Thank God.

681
00:49:05,782 --> 00:49:07,545
Yes, finally!

682
00:49:09,819 --> 00:49:11,218
See, it's okay.

683
00:49:13,556 --> 00:49:15,786
We can do nothing
from our side.

684
00:49:18,995 --> 00:49:21,657
Sweetheart, I told you
we'd be safe.

685
00:49:21,731 --> 00:49:24,529
See? I told you. Yeah.

686
00:49:26,536 --> 00:49:29,801
So, Colonel, what can I get for you?

687
00:49:32,008 --> 00:49:33,168
Something strong.

688
00:49:33,877 --> 00:49:35,242
- Scotch?
- Yeah.

689
00:49:38,515 --> 00:49:40,278
Congratulations, Colonel.

690
00:49:41,551 --> 00:49:43,610
You have performed a minor miracle.

691
00:49:45,822 --> 00:49:48,552
- Congratulations, huh?
- Yes, sir.

692
00:49:52,028 --> 00:49:53,962
You should spit in my face.

693
00:49:55,732 --> 00:49:57,359
Excuse me, Colonel?

694
00:49:57,434 --> 00:49:59,231
You're dirt.

695
00:50:01,971 --> 00:50:03,370
We think you're dirt, Paul.

696
00:50:04,974 --> 00:50:06,373
Who is "we"?

697
00:50:07,410 --> 00:50:10,743
The West, all the superpowers,
everything you believe in, Paul.

698
00:50:10,814 --> 00:50:14,045
They think you're dirt,
they think you're dung. You're worthless.

699
00:50:14,117 --> 00:50:16,642
I'm afraid I don't understand
what you are saying, sir.

700
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:19,017
Come on, don't bullshit me, Paul.

701
00:50:20,023 --> 00:50:21,854
You're the smartest man here.

702
00:50:22,826 --> 00:50:25,886
You got them all eating
out of your hands.

703
00:50:25,962 --> 00:50:29,864
You could own this freakin' hotel,
except for one thing--

704
00:50:29,933 --> 00:50:31,264
you're black.

705
00:50:32,836 --> 00:50:34,827
You're not even a nigger.

706
00:50:36,106 --> 00:50:37,698
You're an African.

707
00:50:43,279 --> 00:50:45,144
They're not gonna stay, Paul.

708
00:50:47,016 --> 00:50:49,177
They're not gonna stop this slaughter.

709
00:50:51,688 --> 00:50:52,814
Please.

710
00:50:53,490 --> 00:50:54,582
Got it.

711
00:50:56,693 --> 00:50:58,752
- Hello.
- Hello, Daddy.

712
00:51:00,263 --> 00:51:02,697
Elys, take Diane in the other room.

713
00:51:06,436 --> 00:51:08,165
What is it?

714
00:51:13,643 --> 00:51:15,304
All the whites are leaving.

715
00:51:16,379 --> 00:51:18,176
They are being evacuated.

716
00:51:19,282 --> 00:51:22,115
But...what about us?

717
00:51:22,819 --> 00:51:24,753
We have been abandoned.

718
00:51:24,821 --> 00:51:27,813
But the soldiers
will stop the killers.

719
00:51:27,891 --> 00:51:30,325
Listen. Listen to me, Tatsi. Listen.

720
00:51:30,393 --> 00:51:33,624
I said all the whites are leaving--
the French, the Italians,

721
00:51:33,696 --> 00:51:36,290
even the U.N. Belgian soldiers,
all of them!

722
00:51:39,035 --> 00:51:40,969
Who is left?

723
00:51:41,871 --> 00:51:43,236
I don't know.

724
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:50,106
Colonel Oliver said he has 300
U.N. peacekeepers for the whole country.

725
00:51:52,549 --> 00:51:55,211
The most he can spare
for the hotel are four men.

726
00:51:56,452 --> 00:51:58,647
And they are not allowed to shoot.

727
00:52:04,494 --> 00:52:06,325
I am a fool.

728
00:52:06,396 --> 00:52:08,591
No. No, no.

729
00:52:09,399 --> 00:52:12,334
They told me
I was one of them, and I...

730
00:52:15,104 --> 00:52:19,598
Wine, chocolates, cigars, style--
I swallowed it.

731
00:52:19,676 --> 00:52:21,940
I swallowed it.
I swallowed all of it.

732
00:52:23,346 --> 00:52:25,314
And they handed me their shit.

733
00:52:30,286 --> 00:52:33,778
I have no history.
I have no memory.

734
00:52:35,425 --> 00:52:37,359
I'm a fool, Tatsi.

735
00:52:39,028 --> 00:52:41,087
You are no fool.

736
00:52:44,601 --> 00:52:46,728
I know who you are.

737
00:52:50,573 --> 00:52:52,165
<i>News Service Africa.</i>

738
00:52:52,242 --> 00:52:55,973
<i>A United Nations source reports
that the U.S. and British representatives</i>

739
00:52:56,045 --> 00:52:58,673
<i>on the Security Council
will lobby for the removal</i>

740
00:52:58,748 --> 00:53:01,342
<i>of all U.N. peacekeepers
from Rwanda.</i>

741
00:53:22,372 --> 00:53:23,839
Please, Jack.
Please don't go.

742
00:53:23,906 --> 00:53:25,840
Wait, he's British.
Take out your passport.

743
00:53:26,743 --> 00:53:28,574
Jack, please don't leave me.

744
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:32,709
Can we talk?
Just one second.

745
00:53:34,117 --> 00:53:35,607
Please, Jack. Please.

746
00:53:35,685 --> 00:53:38,279
They'll put me on the street.
They'll chop me.

747
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:42,890
Here. Now just take...

748
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:45,127
- Take this.
- No, no...

749
00:53:45,194 --> 00:53:47,424
Just take the money.
Please, just take the money.

750
00:53:47,497 --> 00:53:50,091
You must go. You must.
Please, they are waiting.

751
00:53:50,166 --> 00:53:51,861
- Paul!
- They are waiting.

752
00:53:51,934 --> 00:53:52,923
Paul.

753
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:57,433
He won't put you out.
Here, give her anything she wants.

754
00:53:57,507 --> 00:53:59,498
- Anything. Just charge it.
- This is not necessary.

755
00:53:59,575 --> 00:54:01,907
- They're gonna kill us here.
- Let him go.

756
00:54:01,978 --> 00:54:03,912
We have to let him go.

757
00:54:11,688 --> 00:54:14,088
Don't do that, please.

758
00:54:14,157 --> 00:54:16,148
Jesus Christ, I'm so ashamed.

759
00:54:28,338 --> 00:54:30,329
Wait! Wait!

760
00:54:35,044 --> 00:54:36,875
Hold the buses!

761
00:54:36,946 --> 00:54:38,140
Peter!

762
00:54:51,194 --> 00:54:54,527
Thank you for being here.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

763
00:54:54,597 --> 00:54:56,656
- No Rwandans.
- What?

764
00:54:56,733 --> 00:54:59,566
Foreign nationals only.
Sorry, Father, those were the orders.

765
00:54:59,635 --> 00:55:03,230
- But you can't leave the children behind.
- Sorry, Father, we have our orders.

766
00:55:03,306 --> 00:55:04,796
- You can't leave them!
- We can do no more.

767
00:55:04,874 --> 00:55:06,705
Father, it is of no use.

768
00:55:06,776 --> 00:55:10,109
These men are not here--
They are not here to help us.

769
00:55:10,179 --> 00:55:11,840
Please, there is nothing we can do.

770
00:55:11,914 --> 00:55:14,075
Get your people on the bus.
I will take care of the others.

771
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:16,141
It is of no use, Father.
Please, hurry.

772
00:55:20,089 --> 00:55:22,614
No, no, no.
No, no, no. No.

773
00:55:22,692 --> 00:55:24,319
To the hotel.
To the hotel.

774
00:55:28,531 --> 00:55:31,523
Sir, please, don't touch the camera.
We have the right to film.

775
00:55:31,601 --> 00:55:34,229
- No filming.
- Go to the hotel.

776
00:55:34,303 --> 00:55:35,770
Go inside.

777
00:55:36,873 --> 00:55:39,865
Go inside the hotel,
all of you.

778
00:55:39,942 --> 00:55:42,274
Yes, you can stay, yes.
We will take care of you.

779
00:55:42,345 --> 00:55:44,176
Go into the hotel.

780
00:55:48,584 --> 00:55:49,642
No!

781
00:55:50,686 --> 00:55:54,520
Go to the hotel.
Go inside. Go inside the hotel.

782
00:56:43,506 --> 00:56:45,770
Excuse me. Excuse me.

783
00:56:50,046 --> 00:56:52,310
- Sir.
- Come, Dube.

784
00:56:53,382 --> 00:56:56,442
- Please, everyone inside.
- Please, people, let's go inside.

785
00:56:56,519 --> 00:56:59,488
Out of the rain, please.
Come, sister, come.

786
00:57:05,261 --> 00:57:06,250
Paul.

787
00:57:10,566 --> 00:57:11,999
I want you to go.

788
00:57:13,469 --> 00:57:14,800
Go where?

789
00:57:17,406 --> 00:57:21,604
You take the children.
You go get the girls.

790
00:57:21,677 --> 00:57:23,838
- Your card says Hutu--
- What are you saying?

791
00:57:23,913 --> 00:57:27,314
Please, please.
You pay money at the roadblocks.

792
00:57:27,383 --> 00:57:29,317
I want you to go.

793
00:57:29,385 --> 00:57:31,046
No, Tatiana, no.

794
00:57:32,355 --> 00:57:34,084
I will never leave you.

795
00:57:37,093 --> 00:57:38,754
I will never leave you.

796
00:57:44,567 --> 00:57:45,727
Oh, Tatsi.

797
00:57:50,072 --> 00:57:52,905
Let us sleep, my wife.
Let us sleep.

798
00:58:06,188 --> 00:58:08,019
Get up. Get up.

799
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:09,853
Get up, get up, get up.

800
00:58:11,827 --> 00:58:15,490
- Are you the manager?
- Yes, sir. What's the matter?

801
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,197
Everyone must leave the hotel now.

802
00:58:19,268 --> 00:58:21,463
- Why?
- Papa, what's wrong?

803
00:58:21,537 --> 00:58:22,834
It's an order.

804
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:28,333
I need some time--
20, 30 minutes--to take a shower.

805
00:58:29,745 --> 00:58:33,010
- Sir, people are still sleeping.
- I don't care.

806
00:58:34,951 --> 00:58:39,081
Please, let me get you some beers.
You and your boys.

807
00:58:39,155 --> 00:58:42,215
And I'll be down right away, all right?
As quick as I can.

808
00:58:42,291 --> 00:58:45,283
- Ten minutes.
- Yes, sir, ten minutes.

809
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:49,557
- Get out of the way.
- Quick, children, quickly.

810
00:58:49,632 --> 00:58:52,658
- Roger's not here.
- Where is he? Where's Roger?

811
00:58:52,735 --> 00:58:53,895
Under the bed.

812
00:58:55,404 --> 00:58:57,736
Roger. It's Papa.

813
00:58:57,807 --> 00:58:59,707
They've gone.
They've gone, they've gone.

814
00:58:59,775 --> 00:59:02,073
Come, come. Come on.

815
00:59:05,982 --> 00:59:08,644
Oh, my darling.
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

816
00:59:08,718 --> 00:59:10,982
Come on, it's okay. It's okay.

817
00:59:11,053 --> 00:59:13,578
- Go to the roof, Tatiana.
- The roof?

818
00:59:13,656 --> 00:59:15,851
Yes, yes,
go to the roof right now.

819
00:59:16,626 --> 00:59:19,220
Yes, good day.
General Bizimungu, please.

820
00:59:20,429 --> 00:59:22,192
He is where?

821
00:59:22,264 --> 00:59:24,323
No, that is unacceptable.

822
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,061
Who would order such a thing?

823
00:59:28,137 --> 00:59:30,469
Yes, did you find the general?

824
00:59:34,043 --> 00:59:36,375
Gentlemen, please have some beer.

825
00:59:36,445 --> 00:59:38,037
Get me the guest list.

826
00:59:39,315 --> 00:59:40,475
Yes, sir.

827
00:59:43,252 --> 00:59:44,241
Yes?

828
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:48,256
<i>Sorry, sir, but I have a call
from Paul in Kigali. He says it's urgent.</i>

829
00:59:48,324 --> 00:59:50,258
Paul, are you all right?

830
00:59:50,326 --> 00:59:51,850
<i>We have a big problem, sir.</i>

831
00:59:51,927 --> 00:59:53,019
What?

832
00:59:53,095 --> 00:59:55,222
The Hutu army have come.

833
00:59:55,297 --> 00:59:57,857
They've ordered us--
all of us--out of the hotel.

834
00:59:57,933 --> 00:59:59,696
Why are they doing this?

835
00:59:59,769 --> 01:00:02,237
I think they will kill us all.

836
01:00:02,304 --> 01:00:03,293
Kill?

837
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:08,603
What do you mean...all?
How many?

838
01:00:08,678 --> 01:00:13,547
We have 100 staff
and now more than 800 guests.

839
01:00:13,616 --> 01:00:15,607
<i>- 800?!
- Yes, sir.</i>

840
01:00:15,685 --> 01:00:18,882
<i>There are now 800 Tutsi
and Hutu refugees.</i>

841
01:00:18,954 --> 01:00:21,514
I do not have much time left, sir.

842
01:00:25,294 --> 01:00:27,159
I want to thank you

843
01:00:27,229 --> 01:00:29,527
<i>for everything that you
have done for me and my family,</i>

844
01:00:29,598 --> 01:00:32,726
<i>and please thank all
of my friends at Sabena.</i>

845
01:00:34,236 --> 01:00:35,794
Paul, wait.

846
01:00:36,372 --> 01:00:39,136
I'm gonna put you on hold.
Stay by the phone.

847
01:00:40,276 --> 01:00:43,074
- Where are your papers?
- We don't have any papers, sir.

848
01:00:43,145 --> 01:00:46,444
We don't have any papers.
They got burnt in the house.

849
01:00:47,349 --> 01:00:50,011
Louis, get on to the U.N.
Tell them what's happening.

850
01:00:50,086 --> 01:00:51,519
Did you need something, sir?

851
01:00:51,587 --> 01:00:55,990
Mary, call the prime minister's office.
Tell them I must speak with him now.

852
01:00:56,058 --> 01:00:57,184
Okay.

853
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:02,288
Paul, are you there?

854
01:01:03,132 --> 01:01:04,121
Yes, sir.

855
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,929
Who can I call to stop this?

856
01:01:08,471 --> 01:01:11,531
The French.
They supply the Hutu army.

857
01:01:12,842 --> 01:01:16,676
Do everything you can to buy time.
I'll call you right back.

858
01:01:20,649 --> 01:01:23,174
What are you doing, Dube?

859
01:01:23,252 --> 01:01:26,187
The lieutenant, sir,
he wants to see the guest list.

860
01:01:29,291 --> 01:01:32,454
- Go and get these boys some more beer.
- Thirsty, boy? You like beer?

861
01:01:32,528 --> 01:01:33,859
Thank you.

862
01:01:36,766 --> 01:01:38,097
Come with me, please.

863
01:01:42,738 --> 01:01:44,899
Sir, that was two weeks ago.

864
01:01:50,179 --> 01:01:51,669
Here you are, sir.

865
01:01:54,583 --> 01:01:56,949
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier...

866
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:59,810
What is this?

867
01:02:02,758 --> 01:02:04,248
It is the guest list, sir.

868
01:02:05,261 --> 01:02:07,354
Are you trying to make a fool of me?

869
01:02:07,429 --> 01:02:12,526
No. We stopped taking names
after the president was murdered.

870
01:02:12,601 --> 01:02:16,093
- This is the only guest list, sir.
- There are no Europeans left!

871
01:02:17,206 --> 01:02:21,540
Get me the names
of all the cockroaches in there now.

872
01:02:22,444 --> 01:02:25,379
- That will take time.
- We don't have time.

873
01:02:25,447 --> 01:02:30,146
If I don't have the names
so that I can pick out the traitors,

874
01:02:30,219 --> 01:02:33,052
then I'll kill everyone in there.

875
01:02:34,557 --> 01:02:36,047
Starting with you.

876
01:02:36,826 --> 01:02:38,350
Leave.

877
01:02:40,763 --> 01:02:41,821
Yes, sir.

878
01:02:54,076 --> 01:02:55,475
Yes, sir.

879
01:02:56,145 --> 01:02:57,305
Who did you call?

880
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,812
- Who did I call?
- Don't lie to me!

881
01:03:03,219 --> 01:03:05,210
What is your name?

882
01:03:05,287 --> 01:03:07,619
Rusesabagina.

883
01:03:08,724 --> 01:03:10,658
Paul Rusesabagina.

884
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:13,025
I'll remember you.

885
01:03:14,296 --> 01:03:15,695
I'll remember you.

886
01:03:16,665 --> 01:03:20,396
- Let's go.
- Come on, we're leaving.

887
01:03:29,945 --> 01:03:30,934
They've gone.

888
01:03:34,283 --> 01:03:35,682
Paul. Paul.

889
01:03:38,354 --> 01:03:40,345
I was afraid for you.

890
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:45,353
Sir, the president of Sabena
is on the phone for you.

891
01:03:46,729 --> 01:03:48,663
I must talk with this man.

892
01:03:54,503 --> 01:03:57,233
<i>- Mr. Tillens.
- Paul, what's going on?</i>

893
01:03:57,306 --> 01:04:00,639
They left. Thank you, sir.
What did you do?

894
01:04:00,709 --> 01:04:03,803
I got through to the French
president's office.

895
01:04:06,048 --> 01:04:08,380
Well, thank you.
You have saved our lives.

896
01:04:09,218 --> 01:04:13,848
I pleaded with the French and
the Belgians to go back and get you all.

897
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:17,418
<i>I am afraid this is not
going to happen.</i>

898
01:04:19,094 --> 01:04:21,585
They're cowards, Paul.

899
01:04:22,498 --> 01:04:26,229
Rwanda is not worth
a single vote to any of them.

900
01:04:27,636 --> 01:04:30,571
The French, the British,
the Americans.

901
01:04:31,674 --> 01:04:33,335
I am sorry, Paul.

902
01:04:35,611 --> 01:04:36,703
Thank you.

903
01:04:40,349 --> 01:04:41,976
There will be no rescue...

904
01:04:43,419 --> 01:04:45,410
...no intervention for us.

905
01:04:46,956 --> 01:04:49,288
We can only save ourselves.

906
01:04:50,492 --> 01:04:52,653
Many of you know
influential people abroad.

907
01:04:52,728 --> 01:04:54,218
You must call these people.

908
01:04:54,296 --> 01:04:57,322
Please, fax this
to this number. Thank you.

909
01:04:57,399 --> 01:05:00,129
You must tell them
what will happen to us.

910
01:05:01,804 --> 01:05:03,294
Say good-bye.

911
01:05:06,241 --> 01:05:08,004
But when you say good-bye,

912
01:05:08,077 --> 01:05:13,242
say it as though you are reaching
through the phone and holding their hand.

913
01:05:14,149 --> 01:05:16,845
Let them know that
if they let go of that hand...

914
01:05:18,954 --> 01:05:20,444
...you will die.

915
01:05:23,792 --> 01:05:27,523
We must shame them
into sending help.

916
01:05:29,965 --> 01:05:34,925
Most importantly,
this cannot be a refugee camp.

917
01:05:35,004 --> 01:05:39,100
The hterhamwe believe that the
Mille Collines is a four-star Sabena hotel.

918
01:05:39,174 --> 01:05:42,871
That is the only thing
that is keeping us alive.

919
01:05:42,945 --> 01:05:44,879
Have you printed the bills?

920
01:05:46,382 --> 01:05:48,873
Thank you.
Now please erase the register.

921
01:05:48,951 --> 01:05:51,977
- Erase it?
- Yes. I want no names to appear there.

922
01:05:52,688 --> 01:05:54,656
Boss, the carpenters are ready.

923
01:05:54,723 --> 01:05:57,453
Tell them to remove
all of the numbers from the doors.

924
01:05:57,526 --> 01:05:59,551
- And put what?
- And put nothing.

925
01:06:07,403 --> 01:06:10,065
Good day.
Here is your bill for the last week.

926
01:06:10,139 --> 01:06:12,801
If you cannot pay
or think you will not be able to pay,

927
01:06:12,875 --> 01:06:16,276
please go to the banquet room and
Dube will take care of you. Thank you.

928
01:06:20,416 --> 01:06:22,884
<i>Does the State Department
have a view</i>

929
01:06:22,951 --> 01:06:27,149
<i>as to whether or not
what is happening could be genocide?</i>

930
01:06:27,222 --> 01:06:30,623
<i>We have every reason to believe
that acts of genocide have occurred.</i>

931
01:06:30,692 --> 01:06:35,425
<i>How many acts of genocide
does it take to make genocide?</i>

932
01:06:35,497 --> 01:06:38,523
<i>Alan, that's just not a question
that I'm in a position to answer.</i>

933
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:42,161
<i>Is it true that you
have specific guidance</i>

934
01:06:42,237 --> 01:06:44,728
<i>not to use the word "genocide"
in isolation,</i>

935
01:06:44,807 --> 01:06:47,401
<i>but always to preface it
with this word "acts of"?</i>

936
01:06:48,944 --> 01:06:54,007
<i>I have guidance
which I try to use as best as I can.</i>

937
01:06:54,083 --> 01:06:55,641
<i>I have--</i>

938
01:06:55,717 --> 01:06:58,151
<i>There are formulations
that we are using</i>

939
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:01,212
<i>that we are trying to be
consistent in our use of--</i>

940
01:07:03,826 --> 01:07:05,623
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.

941
01:07:06,728 --> 01:07:08,389
As long as it is scotch.

942
01:07:10,699 --> 01:07:14,430
Your white friends
have abandoned you.

943
01:07:16,171 --> 01:07:18,833
- So it would seem.
- Well, don't worry.

944
01:07:18,907 --> 01:07:22,206
- I will take care of you.
- I'm glad to hear that

945
01:07:22,277 --> 01:07:25,212
because I was wondering if perhaps
you could spare us a few policemen.

946
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:26,474
To protect us, sir.

947
01:07:26,548 --> 01:07:29,540
- The police are very busy, Paul.
- Yes, I'm aware of this.

948
01:07:29,618 --> 01:07:32,883
But when I last spoke
to the president of Sabena,

949
01:07:32,955 --> 01:07:36,356
he assured me that anyone
who helped protect Belgian property

950
01:07:36,425 --> 01:07:37,915
would be well rewarded.

951
01:07:38,927 --> 01:07:40,258
I will see what I can do.

952
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:43,091
Excuse me momentarily, sir.

953
01:07:44,833 --> 01:07:46,596
Where has all our beer gone?

954
01:07:47,603 --> 01:07:50,333
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beer.

955
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:52,438
How much beer?

956
01:07:53,375 --> 01:07:54,467
Many.

957
01:07:57,846 --> 01:08:00,781
...come down to the reception.
And then he says to me,

958
01:08:00,849 --> 01:08:02,476
"How do you want the girls?"

959
01:08:04,453 --> 01:08:07,388
There's our cockroach manager.
Always kissing ass.

960
01:08:13,095 --> 01:08:14,255
General...

961
01:08:15,998 --> 01:08:17,727
I'm glad you came by.

962
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,968
I overheard something
that I think you should know about.

963
01:08:21,036 --> 01:08:22,264
What did you overhear?

964
01:08:22,337 --> 01:08:26,603
It was a discussion between a U.N. Colonel
and an American Embassy official.

965
01:08:26,675 --> 01:08:28,074
And what did they say?

966
01:08:28,143 --> 01:08:30,976
The American assured the colonel
that they would watch everything.

967
01:08:31,046 --> 01:08:32,604
How? They have gone, Paul.

968
01:08:32,681 --> 01:08:35,775
With their spies. Satellites.

969
01:08:38,287 --> 01:08:40,118
Americans.

970
01:08:40,189 --> 01:08:42,089
Oh, Gregoire!

971
01:08:45,894 --> 01:08:47,794
You know, I admire you, General.

972
01:08:48,497 --> 01:08:51,295
How do you keep command
of your men amid such madness?

973
01:08:51,366 --> 01:08:55,132
- I am a strong man, Paul.
- I wish I were more like you.

974
01:08:56,071 --> 01:08:58,437
- I mean, look at my staff.
- Cheers.

975
01:08:58,507 --> 01:09:01,169
He won't work,
listens to no one.

976
01:09:01,243 --> 01:09:03,837
- He is staff?
- Oh, yes.

977
01:09:03,912 --> 01:09:04,901
Yes.

978
01:09:15,657 --> 01:09:17,818
Get back to work, you slug! Go!

979
01:09:19,194 --> 01:09:20,627
Satellites?

980
01:09:21,797 --> 01:09:25,289
What was I going to say, that
the Americans were hiding in the trees?

981
01:09:37,346 --> 01:09:41,146
- What's the matter?
- I have to go out and get food.

982
01:09:41,216 --> 01:09:45,152
- Go out? Where?
- To George Rutaganda's place.

983
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:47,347
No. No, no.

984
01:09:47,422 --> 01:09:49,253
I have to, Tatiana.

985
01:09:49,324 --> 01:09:51,952
We are only as valuable
as the money we give to him.

986
01:09:52,027 --> 01:09:53,688
You cannot go alone.

987
01:09:54,563 --> 01:09:58,226
I'm not going alone.
I'll take Gregoire with me.

988
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:01,531
He's a good Hutu,
and he wants to impress me now.

989
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:13,541
It is good to see you
back at work, Gregoire.

990
01:10:13,615 --> 01:10:16,675
- Please, sir, accept my humblest apologies.
- Please, please.

991
01:10:17,552 --> 01:10:19,383
We have a job this morning.

992
01:10:19,454 --> 01:10:21,786
We are going
to see George Rutaganda.

993
01:10:22,858 --> 01:10:24,189
Please get the van.

994
01:10:43,945 --> 01:10:45,435
Show me your I.D.

995
01:10:45,514 --> 01:10:48,005
<i>Remember how those Tutsi women
used to look down</i>

996
01:10:48,083 --> 01:10:51,109
<i>their long noses at Hutu men?
Now they beg for their lives.</i>

997
01:10:51,186 --> 01:10:53,711
I'm here to see my friend
George Rutaganda.

998
01:10:53,789 --> 01:10:58,158
<i>I say taste those
Tutsi whores before they die.</i>

999
01:10:58,226 --> 01:11:01,753
<i>Then they'll know
what Hutu power is, my warriors.</i>

1000
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:05,596
<i>Remember, one cockroach
can start an infestation.</i>

1001
01:11:05,667 --> 01:11:08,135
<i>We need to exterminate these vermin.</i>

1002
01:11:38,867 --> 01:11:41,233
Hey, Paul, my old friend.

1003
01:11:44,673 --> 01:11:48,632
Tutsi prostitutes and witches.
So, what can I do for you?

1004
01:11:49,378 --> 01:11:51,972
- I need supplies, George.
- Anytime.

1005
01:11:57,052 --> 01:12:00,647
Paul, everything is double the price now.
You understand that?

1006
01:12:00,722 --> 01:12:03,885
Yes. I need rice, beans,

1007
01:12:03,959 --> 01:12:07,360
powdered milk, beer,
and your best whiskey.

1008
01:12:08,530 --> 01:12:12,022
Beer yes, but whiskey no.

1009
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:13,658
You have no whiskey?

1010
01:12:13,735 --> 01:12:16,431
No whiskey, no spirits.

1011
01:12:16,505 --> 01:12:21,238
Your...rich guests will have to do
without their scotch.

1012
01:12:21,843 --> 01:12:25,335
Anyway, Paul,
I have bled that cow enough now.

1013
01:12:26,448 --> 01:12:27,972
What are you saying, George?

1014
01:12:28,049 --> 01:12:33,646
Your rich cockroaches at the hotel,
their money is no good to them anymore.

1015
01:12:34,489 --> 01:12:36,719
Soon all the Tutsis will be dead.

1016
01:12:39,294 --> 01:12:42,559
You do not honestly believe
that you can kill them all?

1017
01:12:43,932 --> 01:12:45,331
And why not?

1018
01:12:46,968 --> 01:12:48,560
Why not?

1019
01:12:48,637 --> 01:12:51,128
We are halfway there already.

1020
01:12:53,942 --> 01:12:56,809
So, Paul, you want
12 bags of rice?

1021
01:12:58,013 --> 01:13:00,607
Give him 12 bags of rice
and 4 crates of beer.

1022
01:13:00,682 --> 01:13:02,172
Yes, sir, right away.

1023
01:13:03,718 --> 01:13:09,520
Oh, and, Paul, I'll give you a crate
of soft drinks for the kids free of charge.

1024
01:13:11,026 --> 01:13:12,118
Yes.

1025
01:13:13,862 --> 01:13:16,592
Ten bags of beans.
Come, quick.

1026
01:13:17,232 --> 01:13:19,757
And put those in the van. You.

1027
01:13:21,369 --> 01:13:23,360
Let me give you
a little tip, my friend.

1028
01:13:23,438 --> 01:13:26,168
Our generals in army say,
"Don't go near the Mille Collines

1029
01:13:26,241 --> 01:13:28,436
or they will send
the Belgian soldiers back here."

1030
01:13:28,510 --> 01:13:32,776
But soon those generals will
have gone and we will be in charge.

1031
01:13:34,015 --> 01:13:38,247
It's time to butcher that fat cow
of yours for the meat.

1032
01:13:49,164 --> 01:13:50,563
Let's go.

1033
01:13:53,502 --> 01:13:55,493
Maybe you could help us, Paul.

1034
01:13:55,570 --> 01:13:58,437
You have some very important
traitors at that hotel.

1035
01:13:59,107 --> 01:14:00,938
Now, if we were to get them,

1036
01:14:01,009 --> 01:14:04,809
then maybe we would let you have
one or two cockroaches of your own.

1037
01:14:06,748 --> 01:14:08,147
Do you understand?

1038
01:14:10,185 --> 01:14:13,018
It is almost dawn, George.

1039
01:14:13,088 --> 01:14:15,181
We really must be going.

1040
01:14:16,958 --> 01:14:20,155
Take the river road back.
It's clear.

1041
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:44,444
- Gregoire.
- What is going on now?

1042
01:14:44,519 --> 01:14:46,749
- You've driven off the road.
- No, I'm on the road.

1043
01:14:46,821 --> 01:14:49,654
You're going to put us in the river.
Stop the car, stop the car.

1044
01:16:14,209 --> 01:16:15,904
Back up the car, Gregoire.

1045
01:16:17,812 --> 01:16:18,972
Listen to me.

1046
01:16:20,582 --> 01:16:23,745
You will tell no one
what you have seen here today.

1047
01:16:23,818 --> 01:16:25,217
No one, Gregoire.

1048
01:16:41,536 --> 01:16:45,529
Dube. Please help Gregoire
to unload the van. Thank you.

1049
01:17:19,874 --> 01:17:21,273
Oh, dear.

1050
01:17:53,408 --> 01:17:54,670
Oh, God!

1051
01:17:57,879 --> 01:17:59,107
Oh, God!

1052
01:18:00,315 --> 01:18:01,646
- Sir.
- Dube!

1053
01:18:01,716 --> 01:18:05,584
- Sir, are you okay?
- Don't come in. Don't come in.

1054
01:18:05,653 --> 01:18:07,644
I'll be out in a minute.

1055
01:18:08,923 --> 01:18:11,756
- Sir, are you okay?
- Yes, I'm all right, Dube.

1056
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:14,457
Don't come in. I'll be out.

1057
01:18:48,763 --> 01:18:50,025
Hundreds.

1058
01:18:52,767 --> 01:18:54,860
It was too many to count.

1059
01:18:58,406 --> 01:19:00,874
Why are people so cruel?

1060
01:19:04,846 --> 01:19:06,006
Hatred.

1061
01:19:07,482 --> 01:19:09,313
Insanity. I don't know.

1062
01:19:15,023 --> 01:19:16,047
There you go.

1063
01:19:16,124 --> 01:19:18,422
Is she putting
her fingers in the soup?

1064
01:19:18,493 --> 01:19:20,393
Oh, yes.

1065
01:19:21,563 --> 01:19:24,054
...to do with you.
Nothing to do with me.

1066
01:19:24,132 --> 01:19:25,531
I remember...

1067
01:19:26,634 --> 01:19:28,363
No, no, no, you make a mistake.

1068
01:19:28,436 --> 01:19:30,131
- Hello.
- Come with me.

1069
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:34,074
- Where are we going?
- Just come.

1070
01:19:50,925 --> 01:19:52,256
It's beautiful.

1071
01:19:54,262 --> 01:19:55,524
You like it?

1072
01:20:05,006 --> 01:20:07,406
I hear we must pay for everything.

1073
01:20:07,475 --> 01:20:08,965
Yes, this is true.

1074
01:20:10,278 --> 01:20:13,770
So...how much for this?

1075
01:20:15,783 --> 01:20:17,273
A kiss.

1076
01:20:29,130 --> 01:20:33,965
You are a good man,
Paul Rusesabagina.

1077
01:20:50,652 --> 01:20:52,244
I have a confession.

1078
01:20:54,322 --> 01:20:56,313
When you worked as the nurse...

1079
01:20:56,391 --> 01:20:58,552
- In Ruhengeri?
- Yes.

1080
01:20:58,626 --> 01:21:00,651
When we first met...

1081
01:21:02,230 --> 01:21:04,721
I had you transferred to Kigali.

1082
01:21:07,068 --> 01:21:08,399
What?

1083
01:21:09,370 --> 01:21:13,864
I bribed the Minister of Health
to have you transferred to Kigali.

1084
01:21:15,743 --> 01:21:18,337
- Why?
- To be closer.

1085
01:21:19,814 --> 01:21:21,543
So that I could marry you.

1086
01:21:28,222 --> 01:21:29,553
What was the bribe?

1087
01:21:32,360 --> 01:21:35,523
- What am I worth to you?
- It was substantial.

1088
01:21:35,596 --> 01:21:38,429
- Tell me what it was.
- A car.

1089
01:21:40,535 --> 01:21:43,368
- What sort of car?
- What does that matter?

1090
01:21:43,438 --> 01:21:45,303
I want to know.

1091
01:21:46,874 --> 01:21:48,466
A Volkswagen.

1092
01:21:53,481 --> 01:21:54,812
I hope it was a new one.

1093
01:22:19,907 --> 01:22:23,070
We have had a good life,
you and I. Yes.

1094
01:22:26,047 --> 01:22:30,643
I thank God every day
for the time we've had.

1095
01:22:36,691 --> 01:22:40,593
- We have to have a plan.
- A plan?

1096
01:22:42,463 --> 01:22:45,455
Our children cannot
see us die first.

1097
01:22:45,533 --> 01:22:48,934
If the militia come, you must
come up here as quick as you can.

1098
01:22:49,003 --> 01:22:51,665
- Please, I don't want to--
- You must come up here, Tatiana.

1099
01:22:51,739 --> 01:22:54,674
- I don't want you to talk like this, please.
- We have to, Tatiana.

1100
01:22:56,477 --> 01:22:58,877
If I do not make it,

1101
01:22:58,946 --> 01:23:01,744
you must take all of our children
by the hand...

1102
01:23:03,518 --> 01:23:04,849
...and you must jump.

1103
01:23:06,921 --> 01:23:10,254
- What are you saying? I could never--
- You have to, Tatiana.

1104
01:23:10,324 --> 01:23:13,088
- You have to promise me.
- What are you saying?

1105
01:23:13,161 --> 01:23:16,460
Tatiana, the machete is no way to die.
You have to promise me you will do it.

1106
01:23:16,531 --> 01:23:18,260
I cannot do--

1107
01:23:18,332 --> 01:23:21,096
You have to
promise me, Tatiana. Please.

1108
01:23:21,169 --> 01:23:22,761
Promise me you will do it.

1109
01:23:26,407 --> 01:23:28,238
Please, Tatiana.

1110
01:23:31,379 --> 01:23:32,539
Yes.

1111
01:23:35,383 --> 01:23:37,112
I'm sorry. I love you.

1112
01:23:38,853 --> 01:23:40,184
I love you.

1113
01:23:48,062 --> 01:23:49,552
I'm gonna get you!

1114
01:23:50,998 --> 01:23:52,989
Diane, Elys, you know better.

1115
01:23:53,067 --> 01:23:55,592
No one can be at the front
of the hotel. I have told you this.

1116
01:23:55,670 --> 01:23:57,968
- Take these children in the back. Hurry.
- Sorry, Papa.

1117
01:23:59,173 --> 01:24:01,004
- Come, children. Come.
- Thank you, Dube.

1118
01:24:03,744 --> 01:24:06,975
Paul, I've got good news.

1119
01:24:09,984 --> 01:24:13,715
Congratulations.
Your calls have worked.

1120
01:24:13,788 --> 01:24:17,588
I have exit visas
for the following families.

1121
01:24:17,658 --> 01:24:20,855
Abukesu, Tanzania.

1122
01:24:20,928 --> 01:24:23,920
Bidori, Kenya.

1123
01:24:25,833 --> 01:24:27,926
Gituaranga, Zambia.

1124
01:24:28,002 --> 01:24:29,765
Hallelujah!

1125
01:24:29,837 --> 01:24:31,498
Khalesa, Belgium.

1126
01:24:31,572 --> 01:24:32,732
Oh, thank you!

1127
01:24:33,908 --> 01:24:35,307
Dakuzi...

1128
01:24:36,878 --> 01:24:38,140
Kenya.

1129
01:24:39,013 --> 01:24:41,777
Masambo, Zambia.

1130
01:24:43,017 --> 01:24:45,349
Zinguru, Ghana.

1131
01:24:45,419 --> 01:24:48,479
Rusesabagina, Belgium.

1132
01:24:49,757 --> 01:24:51,224
All right, that's it.

1133
01:24:52,693 --> 01:24:55,685
So remember,
families be ready at 7 a.m.

1134
01:24:55,763 --> 01:24:57,025
Let's go.

1135
01:24:57,098 --> 01:24:58,156
- Colonel?
- Yeah.

1136
01:24:59,233 --> 01:25:01,428
Now, certainly Odette
and Jean Baptiste are on the list.

1137
01:25:01,502 --> 01:25:04,335
I'm sorry, Jean, Odette.

1138
01:25:05,506 --> 01:25:09,067
But I have been assured
there will be another plane soon.

1139
01:25:09,143 --> 01:25:10,132
Excuse me.

1140
01:25:12,647 --> 01:25:15,707
Don't worry, Tatsi,
we'll make it to the next list.

1141
01:25:15,783 --> 01:25:16,772
Yeah.

1142
01:25:18,386 --> 01:25:21,321
The girls--
Paul, I will not leave without them.

1143
01:25:31,332 --> 01:25:32,663
What have you brought us?

1144
01:25:32,733 --> 01:25:36,066
Antibiotics, medical supplies,
general first aid.

1145
01:25:36,137 --> 01:25:37,627
Thank you.

1146
01:25:37,705 --> 01:25:40,196
- I hear there's to be a convoy.
- Yes.

1147
01:25:40,274 --> 01:25:42,003
Are you on the list?

1148
01:25:45,479 --> 01:25:50,212
Madame Archer, I have
an impossible request of you.

1149
01:25:51,185 --> 01:25:54,450
Is there any way that you
could return to the old woman

1150
01:25:54,522 --> 01:25:56,513
and bring the girls
back here to us?

1151
01:25:56,591 --> 01:26:00,550
Paul, that side of town has been
destroyed in the fighting.

1152
01:26:01,495 --> 01:26:02,826
They're probably dead.

1153
01:26:05,900 --> 01:26:09,233
Madame Archer, I'm begging you.
Those girls have no one now.

1154
01:26:13,007 --> 01:26:14,497
I'll try.

1155
01:26:15,643 --> 01:26:17,736
We have to leave by 7 a.m.

1156
01:26:18,246 --> 01:26:20,339
Who'll take care
of the orphans when you're gone?

1157
01:26:20,414 --> 01:26:24,077
Odette. Odette will care for them
until we can get them out of here.

1158
01:26:28,289 --> 01:26:32,282
Tell me, Paul, what country's
gonna take 20 Rwandan orphans?

1159
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:36,091
I will find someone.
I promise you.

1160
01:26:38,332 --> 01:26:40,459
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

1161
01:26:47,975 --> 01:26:49,374
Come on, take my hand.

1162
01:26:49,977 --> 01:26:53,310
<i>News Service Africa.
Today a Red Cross representative</i>

1163
01:26:53,381 --> 01:26:55,941
<i>claimed that the death rate
in the Rwandan conflict</i>

1164
01:26:56,017 --> 01:26:59,578
<i>may have climbed to as many
as 500.000 victims.</i>

1165
01:26:59,654 --> 01:27:02,054
<i>One report stated
that 40.000 bodies</i>

1166
01:27:02,123 --> 01:27:04,353
<i>had been removed
from Lake Victoria.</i>

1167
01:27:06,227 --> 01:27:07,251
Where is she?

1168
01:27:07,328 --> 01:27:11,094
I don't know.
We wait until seven.

1169
01:27:11,165 --> 01:27:13,565
If she is not back
with the girls by then...

1170
01:27:14,935 --> 01:27:16,425
...she may not be coming.

1171
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:20,229
Thank you.

1172
01:27:20,308 --> 01:27:22,538
Please, take these letters.

1173
01:27:22,610 --> 01:27:24,874
Yes, I will take your letters.

1174
01:27:24,945 --> 01:27:27,413
Thank you so much, Paul,
taking the letter.

1175
01:27:28,949 --> 01:27:31,782
- Thank you so much.
- Yes, I am sorry.

1176
01:27:31,852 --> 01:27:33,012
Thank you very much.

1177
01:27:33,087 --> 01:27:35,851
I am sorry. I wish I could
have done more. I am sorry.

1178
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:39,990
God be with you.

1179
01:27:41,395 --> 01:27:44,558
- Yes, do you have any children?
- Yes, you're clear to go.

1180
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:47,731
No, sorry, no good.

1181
01:27:48,235 --> 01:27:50,601
Come. Come, children.

1182
01:27:50,671 --> 01:27:52,400
Tatsi, come.

1183
01:27:54,275 --> 01:27:56,607
Please, Paul, the girls.
We wait a little longer.

1184
01:27:56,677 --> 01:27:58,668
We cannot wait.
We cannot wait, Tatsi.

1185
01:27:58,746 --> 01:27:59,735
There you go.

1186
01:28:00,381 --> 01:28:01,712
Let's move out!

1187
01:28:05,419 --> 01:28:06,750
Good luck, sir.

1188
01:28:18,165 --> 01:28:22,761
I am not leaving. You hold Tatiana.
Take care of my family.

1189
01:28:28,943 --> 01:28:30,433
Paul. Paul!

1190
01:28:31,612 --> 01:28:35,104
I cannot leave these people to die.
I cannot leave these people.

1191
01:28:35,182 --> 01:28:36,444
Papa!

1192
01:28:36,517 --> 01:28:39,486
Roger! Roger, I will follow
on the next flight.

1193
01:28:39,553 --> 01:28:42,317
No, don't leave me! Paul!

1194
01:28:42,390 --> 01:28:45,848
Don't worry. Don't worry, children.
Your father's going to be okay.

1195
01:28:45,926 --> 01:28:46,950
Papa!

1196
01:28:47,027 --> 01:28:50,793
- Don't worry. He's okay.
- I want Papa!

1197
01:28:50,865 --> 01:28:52,332
It's okay.

1198
01:29:17,858 --> 01:29:21,191
<i>I say those Hutus
who shelter the cockroaches</i>

1199
01:29:21,262 --> 01:29:23,594
<i>are the same as cockroaches.</i>

1200
01:29:25,733 --> 01:29:27,598
<i>- They are all the same.
- This is crazy.</i>

1201
01:29:27,668 --> 01:29:31,729
<i>Their fate should be the same.
This is RTLM.</i>

1202
01:29:42,783 --> 01:29:46,947
<i>The Tutsi cockroaches
of the rebel army must be denied recruits.</i>

1203
01:29:47,021 --> 01:29:50,616
<i>Come on, good Hutus.
The graves are not yet full.</i>

1204
01:29:50,691 --> 01:29:53,558
<i>- Who will help us fill them?
- That goddamn radio station.</i>

1205
01:29:54,662 --> 01:29:57,927
Okay. Yeah, they are
going to the airport.

1206
01:30:01,502 --> 01:30:05,529
<i>Stand by your radios.
I am hearing some urgent news.</i>

1207
01:30:06,740 --> 01:30:09,834
- Boss! Please, come quick!
- Not now, Dube.

1208
01:30:09,910 --> 01:30:12,879
It is important! It is on the radio.
You have to hear it.

1209
01:30:14,248 --> 01:30:17,513
<i>We have received reports
of very important cockroaches</i>

1210
01:30:17,585 --> 01:30:21,419
<i>and traitors trying to escape
from the Mille Collines Hotel.</i>

1211
01:30:21,489 --> 01:30:23,013
<i>Gather up your weapons.</i>

1212
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:26,253
<i>Stand by your radios.
We will keep you informed.</i>

1213
01:30:26,327 --> 01:30:29,558
<i>- They are being smuggled away...
- No, no! Who told them of this, Dube?</i>

1214
01:30:29,630 --> 01:30:32,895
I saw Gregoire, sir. It is Gregoire.
I saw him leaving in our bus.

1215
01:30:42,476 --> 01:30:44,967
Please, sir,
I will give you whatever I have.

1216
01:30:45,045 --> 01:30:47,605
I say who leaves that hotel,
and no one else.

1217
01:30:50,050 --> 01:30:52,951
General Bizimungu,
they are driving into an ambush.

1218
01:31:13,374 --> 01:31:14,534
Slow down.

1219
01:31:16,410 --> 01:31:18,002
Stay calm.

1220
01:31:18,612 --> 01:31:20,512
- What is happening?
- We're stopping.

1221
01:31:22,683 --> 01:31:24,913
You have got cockroaches
in these trucks.

1222
01:31:24,985 --> 01:31:27,351
No, no. I've got
U.N. personnel in these trucks.

1223
01:31:27,421 --> 01:31:29,651
I've got permission to go
through these roadblocks.

1224
01:31:29,723 --> 01:31:33,056
- I'm going to search these trucks.
- You are not going to search this convoy.

1225
01:31:34,695 --> 01:31:36,822
- I am.
- Cover me.

1226
01:31:43,871 --> 01:31:45,361
Go to the back.

1227
01:31:51,378 --> 01:31:55,007
Get away from that truck.
Get away from that truck! Now!

1228
01:32:04,592 --> 01:32:06,719
Get back!
You're not to hurt these people.

1229
01:32:08,295 --> 01:32:09,785
Get back! Move back!

1230
01:32:10,464 --> 01:32:12,864
Look, I told you,
you've got cockroaches in your truck.

1231
01:32:12,933 --> 01:32:16,596
No, no, no. They're political refugees
under U.N. sanction.

1232
01:32:20,207 --> 01:32:24,371
<i>News has come to us
that we have cowards in our own army</i>

1233
01:32:24,445 --> 01:32:26,606
<i>who will not let us punish them.</i>

1234
01:32:29,783 --> 01:32:30,772
No!

1235
01:32:32,886 --> 01:32:34,877
You're moving cockroaches
from Mille Collines?

1236
01:32:34,955 --> 01:32:37,423
No, sir. No, sir,
they're political refugees.

1237
01:32:37,491 --> 01:32:40,551
- They cannot leave Mille Collines.
- They are not leaving.

1238
01:32:41,428 --> 01:32:42,452
Stop him!

1239
01:32:44,832 --> 01:32:46,197
You bastard!

1240
01:32:51,972 --> 01:32:53,030
What's your name?

1241
01:32:53,107 --> 01:32:55,473
- What's your name?
- I can't think...

1242
01:32:56,276 --> 01:32:59,245
- Kill them!
- Get everybody out of here! Move it!

1243
01:32:59,313 --> 01:33:02,146
What's your name?
What's your name?

1244
01:33:02,750 --> 01:33:04,081
Let's move! Drive!

1245
01:33:04,151 --> 01:33:05,914
Move! Get out!

1246
01:33:05,986 --> 01:33:07,476
Out, or I'll shoot!

1247
01:33:10,724 --> 01:33:11,713
Get out!

1248
01:33:15,496 --> 01:33:17,088
Drive, drive! Let's go!

1249
01:33:18,032 --> 01:33:20,023
Help us get out of here.

1250
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:21,863
Clear the street!

1251
01:33:31,512 --> 01:33:34,174
<i>I am receiving more news,
good Hutus.</i>

1252
01:33:34,248 --> 01:33:38,082
<i>I have learned that
the traitor Rusesabagina's cockroaches</i>

1253
01:33:38,152 --> 01:33:39,551
<i>are on a truck.</i>

1254
01:33:39,620 --> 01:33:41,850
<i>10.000 francs for their heads!</i>

1255
01:33:44,124 --> 01:33:46,786
Stay still.
Give me your shirt, quickly.

1256
01:33:56,370 --> 01:33:58,361
Come on, Paul.
Come on, come on!

1257
01:33:58,439 --> 01:34:01,465
Come on, here, here.
Give me your hand. Come on.

1258
01:34:04,011 --> 01:34:05,308
Please, please.

1259
01:34:05,379 --> 01:34:08,212
- Hey, medic. Get a medic over here!
- You need to hurry up, please.

1260
01:34:08,282 --> 01:34:10,011
Come, hurry, hurry.

1261
01:34:12,886 --> 01:34:15,320
- Let me help you.
- Someone give this guard a hand, please.

1262
01:34:18,292 --> 01:34:19,782
Oh, Tatiana, my darling.

1263
01:34:22,863 --> 01:34:25,058
- I was so worried about you.
- Move that truck out of the way!

1264
01:34:25,132 --> 01:34:26,121
Get him inside!

1265
01:34:26,934 --> 01:34:29,095
Tatiana. Tatiana.

1266
01:34:30,437 --> 01:34:32,928
You left me.
You left me.

1267
01:34:33,006 --> 01:34:35,099
Take this. I don't want it.
I don't want it.

1268
01:34:35,175 --> 01:34:37,973
You said you'd never leave me,
and you left me. You are a liar!

1269
01:34:40,214 --> 01:34:42,341
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1270
01:34:42,416 --> 01:34:44,213
- I'm sorry.
- Papa, Papa.

1271
01:34:44,284 --> 01:34:47,185
- Papa, Mama!
- I love you.

1272
01:34:55,829 --> 01:34:58,593
I wanted you to be safe,
all of you.

1273
01:34:59,466 --> 01:35:02,128
That was not
your decision to make.

1274
01:35:02,202 --> 01:35:05,638
We make our decisions together.
That was our promise.

1275
01:35:05,706 --> 01:35:07,401
You're right.

1276
01:35:07,574 --> 01:35:09,508
You're right.

1277
01:35:09,576 --> 01:35:12,477
I knew that the minute
the truck pulled away.

1278
01:35:12,546 --> 01:35:13,945
I'm sorry.

1279
01:35:14,281 --> 01:35:15,475
Come on, put some more water.

1280
01:35:15,549 --> 01:35:17,107
What are they doing?

1281
01:35:18,218 --> 01:35:19,742
Dube.

1282
01:35:20,521 --> 01:35:24,184
I'm sorry, sir. They shut down
the water. This is all we have.

1283
01:35:30,731 --> 01:35:32,392
General.

1284
01:35:32,466 --> 01:35:33,933
Where are my supplies?

1285
01:35:34,768 --> 01:35:36,668
I'm sorry, sir.
The cellar is empty.

1286
01:35:36,737 --> 01:35:41,800
You have nothing, and yet
you call me, begging me for help?

1287
01:35:41,875 --> 01:35:44,207
Do you know the trouble I have
protecting these cockroaches?

1288
01:35:44,278 --> 01:35:46,576
Sir, I have money from the guests.

1289
01:35:46,647 --> 01:35:48,581
Rwandan francs!

1290
01:35:49,550 --> 01:35:51,711
Those are only good
for wiping your ass.

1291
01:35:53,287 --> 01:35:55,414
There is nothing more
I can do for you, Paul.

1292
01:35:55,489 --> 01:35:58,151
No more police,
no more protection.

1293
01:35:59,526 --> 01:36:02,393
Let the U.N. take care of you.

1294
01:36:05,332 --> 01:36:07,061
Drive. Go!

1295
01:36:13,640 --> 01:36:15,767
What would Sabena make of this?

1296
01:36:23,584 --> 01:36:24,676
Watch out!

1297
01:36:30,657 --> 01:36:32,181
Get down, get down!

1298
01:36:36,730 --> 01:36:38,994
Are you hurt?
Go outside.

1299
01:36:39,066 --> 01:36:41,591
Please stay still.
There's glass here. I will get it out.

1300
01:36:41,668 --> 01:36:43,397
Is anyone hurt, Odette?

1301
01:36:43,470 --> 01:36:45,597
Lots of cuts and bruises.

1302
01:36:52,079 --> 01:36:53,944
Thank God it was a storeroom.

1303
01:36:55,883 --> 01:36:58,818
<i>And in Rwanda,
humanitarian agencies report</i>

1304
01:36:58,886 --> 01:37:01,411
<i>that a rapid advance
by the Tutsi rebel army</i>

1305
01:37:01,488 --> 01:37:05,356
<i>has sparked a mass evacuation
of Hutu refugees towards the Congo.</i>

1306
01:37:05,425 --> 01:37:07,586
<i>One aid worker described it</i>

1307
01:37:07,661 --> 01:37:10,687
<i>as the largest refugee exodus
in modern history.</i>

1308
01:37:10,764 --> 01:37:12,459
The rebels have taken half the city,

1309
01:37:12,532 --> 01:37:16,730
and they have proposed a deal
the Hutu generals are willing to accept.

1310
01:37:17,638 --> 01:37:20,664
The rebels will exchange
their Hutu prisoners,

1311
01:37:20,741 --> 01:37:22,572
and you people,
all of you,

1312
01:37:22,643 --> 01:37:26,010
will be able to move
behind the rebel lines where it's safe.

1313
01:37:26,079 --> 01:37:28,138
The hterhamwe, what about them?

1314
01:37:28,215 --> 01:37:31,548
- No one controls them.
- This time they will kill us all.

1315
01:37:31,618 --> 01:37:34,018
They will kill us all if we stay here.

1316
01:37:34,688 --> 01:37:36,417
We have to take the chance.

1317
01:37:37,357 --> 01:37:39,348
What time should we
be ready to leave?

1318
01:37:40,294 --> 01:37:42,387
I can put it together
in two days, Paul.

1319
01:37:42,462 --> 01:37:43,724
Two days?

1320
01:37:44,564 --> 01:37:47,294
Colonel, there is no way that we
can hold out for two days.

1321
01:37:47,367 --> 01:37:49,164
I have nothing left
to bribe them with.

1322
01:37:50,704 --> 01:37:54,765
Colonel, we will
all be dead in two days.

1323
01:38:18,398 --> 01:38:21,561
Diane...let your mother rest.

1324
01:38:21,635 --> 01:38:23,967
You rest too, sweetheart.
Go to sleep.

1325
01:38:32,813 --> 01:38:34,041
Diplomat.

1326
01:38:36,049 --> 01:38:37,107
What?

1327
01:38:38,018 --> 01:38:39,952
I have to go to the Diplomat.

1328
01:38:50,263 --> 01:38:53,130
- What are you doing?
- We have to go to the Diplomat.

1329
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:55,725
- To do what?
- Your items, they are there.

1330
01:38:57,170 --> 01:38:59,661
Will you please put your
policemen at the gate, sir?

1331
01:38:59,740 --> 01:39:02,641
No. Let us see
what you have to offer first.

1332
01:39:14,087 --> 01:39:16,248
Oh, no. Madame Archer.

1333
01:39:34,107 --> 01:39:35,096
Move, move!

1334
01:39:40,547 --> 01:39:41,878
- Cover us.
- Yes, sir.

1335
01:39:41,948 --> 01:39:42,937
Hurry!

1336
01:39:47,287 --> 01:39:48,584
Come on, show me.

1337
01:39:57,798 --> 01:40:00,631
Look at this.
Nice, yes?

1338
01:40:01,401 --> 01:40:02,732
And here you are.

1339
01:40:09,543 --> 01:40:12,103
The rebels are
getting closer, yes?

1340
01:40:12,979 --> 01:40:15,504
The rebels can have this graveyard.

1341
01:40:15,582 --> 01:40:17,914
We have ordered everyone
out of the city.

1342
01:40:20,654 --> 01:40:21,814
Here.

1343
01:40:22,923 --> 01:40:24,151
Have a drink.

1344
01:40:30,931 --> 01:40:32,922
You know what
the Scottish call it?

1345
01:40:32,999 --> 01:40:34,489
No.

1346
01:40:36,336 --> 01:40:39,737
<i>Uisge beatha--water of life.</i>

1347
01:40:45,946 --> 01:40:51,885
I went once on a tour of the finest
single malt distillery in the world.

1348
01:40:52,752 --> 01:40:55,687
- Have you ever been to Scotland?
- No, sir.

1349
01:40:56,823 --> 01:40:58,313
Wonderful country.

1350
01:40:59,059 --> 01:41:00,651
Wonderful golf.

1351
01:41:01,895 --> 01:41:04,989
I wonder, will I ever go back?

1352
01:41:06,633 --> 01:41:07,895
What do you think?

1353
01:41:09,269 --> 01:41:10,429
No.

1354
01:41:12,038 --> 01:41:15,030
I hope we all get to do
a great many things, General.

1355
01:41:16,543 --> 01:41:18,101
Can we go now,
please, sir?

1356
01:41:19,846 --> 01:41:22,508
I am going to do you
a great favor, Paul.

1357
01:41:22,616 --> 01:41:24,550
- Private.
- Yes, sir!

1358
01:41:24,618 --> 01:41:27,815
Pack those carefully,
put them in my jeep, and guard them.

1359
01:41:28,588 --> 01:41:33,116
I am going to take you with us
to our new headquarters in Gitarama.

1360
01:41:33,894 --> 01:41:35,987
I do not want to go
to Gitarama, sir.

1361
01:41:36,062 --> 01:41:38,724
Well, you can't go back
to the hotel.

1362
01:41:38,798 --> 01:41:40,629
The crazy men are
on their way there now.

1363
01:41:40,700 --> 01:41:46,104
Sir...General, we must go back
so that I can get my family.

1364
01:41:46,173 --> 01:41:49,301
Trust me,
we are better off here.

1365
01:41:49,376 --> 01:41:54,245
General, these are difficult times.

1366
01:41:54,314 --> 01:41:56,111
We need to help one another.

1367
01:41:56,183 --> 01:41:59,516
And what help can I get
from you, Paul?

1368
01:41:59,586 --> 01:42:03,022
- You are a marked man, sir.
- How so?

1369
01:42:03,089 --> 01:42:06,889
You are on a list. The Americans
have you on their list as a war criminal.

1370
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:09,952
Paul, I am sick and tired
of your lies.

1371
01:42:10,030 --> 01:42:12,794
Are you stupid, General?

1372
01:42:12,866 --> 01:42:15,061
How do you think
these people operate?

1373
01:42:15,135 --> 01:42:19,595
You sit here with five stars on your chest.
Who do you think they are coming after?

1374
01:42:24,211 --> 01:42:25,371
Fine.

1375
01:42:26,780 --> 01:42:30,716
We will go to Gitarama,
and you will stay on that list.

1376
01:42:30,784 --> 01:42:34,686
- I committed no war crimes.
- Who will tell them?

1377
01:42:34,754 --> 01:42:37,689
You need me to tell them
how you helped at the hotel.

1378
01:42:37,757 --> 01:42:40,988
They blame you for all their misfortunes.
They say you led the massacres.

1379
01:42:41,061 --> 01:42:42,551
I led no massacres!

1380
01:42:42,629 --> 01:42:44,563
Do you think they're
going to believe you?

1381
01:42:44,631 --> 01:42:46,155
You will tell them the truth!

1382
01:42:46,233 --> 01:42:48,428
I will tell them nothing
unless you help me.

1383
01:42:50,270 --> 01:42:52,704
What are you going to do,
shoot me?

1384
01:42:54,741 --> 01:42:56,072
Shoot me.

1385
01:42:56,710 --> 01:42:58,837
Please shoot me.
It would be a blessing.

1386
01:42:58,912 --> 01:43:02,245
I will pay you to shoot my family.

1387
01:43:03,250 --> 01:43:04,581
You cannot hurt me.

1388
01:43:04,651 --> 01:43:08,212
You will tell them
that I did nothing!

1389
01:43:10,957 --> 01:43:13,824
We are leaving.
Right now.

1390
01:43:22,669 --> 01:43:24,637
Get out!

1391
01:43:26,940 --> 01:43:28,999
Get these people
away from the gate!

1392
01:43:34,848 --> 01:43:36,907
Stop it! Stop it!

1393
01:43:37,584 --> 01:43:38,915
Clear the hotel.

1394
01:43:39,686 --> 01:43:41,847
- Tatiana!
- Get out of here!

1395
01:43:41,921 --> 01:43:43,320
- Get out!
- Tatiana!

1396
01:43:44,124 --> 01:43:45,386
Get out!

1397
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:50,389
All of the militia
must leave now! Get out!

1398
01:44:11,985 --> 01:44:13,145
Oh, no, no!

1399
01:44:13,219 --> 01:44:14,709
Shut up, cockroach!
Get down!

1400
01:44:17,223 --> 01:44:19,088
That's him. That's him!

1401
01:44:20,226 --> 01:44:22,353
- Shit.
- That's the manager!

1402
01:44:22,429 --> 01:44:25,694
- Stop him. Stop him!
- I got him! I got him!

1403
01:44:36,976 --> 01:44:39,001
Stay where you are!

1404
01:44:55,995 --> 01:44:57,622
Tatiana!

1405
01:44:58,932 --> 01:45:00,661
Tatiana!

1406
01:45:06,639 --> 01:45:08,903
- Have you seen Tatiana?
- No, I've not seen Tatiana.

1407
01:45:08,975 --> 01:45:11,466
- Paul, what is happening?
- I have to find my wife!

1408
01:45:13,780 --> 01:45:14,906
Tatiana!

1409
01:45:18,918 --> 01:45:20,078
Tatiana!

1410
01:45:46,846 --> 01:45:48,609
They've gone. They've gone.

1411
01:45:50,950 --> 01:45:51,939
They've gone.

1412
01:45:56,856 --> 01:45:58,847
What were you
going to do with this?

1413
01:46:08,568 --> 01:46:10,502
I thought you had...

1414
01:46:10,570 --> 01:46:12,367
I thought you had jumped.

1415
01:46:24,551 --> 01:46:26,712
Everyone on the trucks, please.

1416
01:46:26,786 --> 01:46:29,550
Take your luggage.
Families please stay together.

1417
01:46:29,622 --> 01:46:32,489
- Oh, please.
- As fast as you can, everyone. Please.

1418
01:46:32,559 --> 01:46:34,993
There's enough room for everyone.

1419
01:46:38,298 --> 01:46:40,163
I hope someday we will come back.

1420
01:46:41,401 --> 01:46:42,595
Let's move out.

1421
01:46:52,645 --> 01:46:54,738
What is wrong with her?

1422
01:46:55,415 --> 01:46:57,508
She has a very high fever.

1423
01:47:05,325 --> 01:47:07,793
Where are we going, Daddy?

1424
01:47:07,861 --> 01:47:09,488
Someplace safe.

1425
01:48:07,287 --> 01:48:08,515
My God.

1426
01:48:30,910 --> 01:48:32,502
What's happening?

1427
01:48:57,303 --> 01:49:00,500
Come on, let's go. Children on the ground.
Bring the children this way.

1428
01:49:00,573 --> 01:49:02,837
Pass them back, pass them back.

1429
01:49:08,915 --> 01:49:12,078
Do not stop. Do not stop!
Go right on through.

1430
01:49:24,464 --> 01:49:25,897
Get down!

1431
01:49:28,601 --> 01:49:29,727
Stay down!

1432
01:49:53,259 --> 01:49:54,749
What's happening there?

1433
01:49:58,264 --> 01:50:01,756
It's the rebels.
We're crossing the front line.

1434
01:50:02,735 --> 01:50:05,499
It's okay. We're safe.

1435
01:50:05,571 --> 01:50:06,697
It's okay.

1436
01:50:06,773 --> 01:50:08,764
It's okay, you are safe here.
You are safe.

1437
01:50:08,841 --> 01:50:12,470
It's okay now.
Sit back down.

1438
01:50:14,247 --> 01:50:15,407
Hello.

1439
01:50:46,112 --> 01:50:47,943
Get some more water.

1440
01:50:49,215 --> 01:50:52,207
The doctor says he is
very dehydrated.

1441
01:50:52,285 --> 01:50:54,810
We made it.
Come on, let's get down.

1442
01:50:56,155 --> 01:50:57,986
- Come on.
- It is okay.

1443
01:50:58,057 --> 01:50:59,786
- She is sick.
- Okay.

1444
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:02,227
Yeah, she's very sick.
Take her.

1445
01:51:04,664 --> 01:51:08,998
Paul, the buses are
on the other side of camp.

1446
01:51:09,068 --> 01:51:11,434
They'll take you to Tanzania.

1447
01:51:11,504 --> 01:51:15,304
Go now, Paul, 'cause I don't know
when there'd be another opportunity.

1448
01:51:15,374 --> 01:51:16,705
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1449
01:51:16,776 --> 01:51:19,006
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1450
01:51:21,981 --> 01:51:23,972
- Thank God.
- We made it.

1451
01:51:24,050 --> 01:51:26,610
Please, please.
We are here, yeah?

1452
01:51:26,686 --> 01:51:28,313
- Thank you, Paul.
- We have made it.

1453
01:51:28,387 --> 01:51:30,378
- Thank you.
- Yes, yes. Come.

1454
01:51:30,857 --> 01:51:31,846
Mr. Manager.

1455
01:51:31,924 --> 01:51:34,324
- I just want to thank you.
- Of course, Steven.

1456
01:51:34,393 --> 01:51:35,485
Constance!

1457
01:51:36,429 --> 01:51:39,193
Thank God you are alive!
It's so good to see you.

1458
01:51:39,265 --> 01:51:41,756
Have you seen my brother
and his wife?

1459
01:51:41,834 --> 01:51:42,994
None of them.

1460
01:51:43,770 --> 01:51:46,261
Has anyone seen these people?
You don't recog--

1461
01:51:46,339 --> 01:51:48,671
Mama, come see quick.

1462
01:51:48,741 --> 01:51:51,209
- Excuse me, excuse me.
- Can you see them anywhere?

1463
01:51:53,212 --> 01:51:54,804
Here, Mama, look.

1464
01:51:54,881 --> 01:51:56,143
Please.

1465
01:51:57,784 --> 01:52:01,049
Do you see them, Mama?
Is that them?

1466
01:52:01,754 --> 01:52:03,551
Is that them, Mama?

1467
01:52:04,891 --> 01:52:06,984
Do you recognize these people?

1468
01:52:07,059 --> 01:52:10,187
This little girl, she's Anais,
and this is Carine.

1469
01:52:10,263 --> 01:52:11,753
Do you recognize them?

1470
01:52:13,499 --> 01:52:17,196
- Ma'am, have you seen these girls?
- No, no, I haven't.

1471
01:52:17,270 --> 01:52:19,431
Have any of you seen these girls?

1472
01:52:21,874 --> 01:52:24,570
Anais. And that's my brother.

1473
01:52:24,644 --> 01:52:26,635
<i>Everybody on the buses!</i>

1474
01:52:35,388 --> 01:52:37,413
Can you feel anything
when I touch here?

1475
01:52:37,490 --> 01:52:39,515
<i>Everybody on the buses!</i>

1476
01:52:39,592 --> 01:52:42,186
Can you move out of the way?
We need some room here!

1477
01:52:42,261 --> 01:52:45,594
- We'll find the girls, Tatsi. We will.
- Okay.

1478
01:52:49,535 --> 01:52:51,162
Boussey?

1479
01:52:51,237 --> 01:52:52,568
It's you.

1480
01:52:55,641 --> 01:52:57,131
Where'd you find this child?

1481
01:52:57,210 --> 01:52:59,542
They just arrived
on trucks from the Mille Collines.

1482
01:53:01,747 --> 01:53:05,683
<i>All Mille Collines evacuees
to the buses now, please.</i>

1483
01:53:05,751 --> 01:53:07,742
- Oh, no.
- We need to hurry up, please.

1484
01:53:14,126 --> 01:53:16,458
Come on, get some sleep.

1485
01:53:17,663 --> 01:53:18,789
Wait!

1486
01:53:28,441 --> 01:53:30,272
Hold it, please!

1487
01:53:33,045 --> 01:53:34,740
- Tatiana!
- It's Pat!

1488
01:53:34,814 --> 01:53:37,282
- Tatiana!
- Madame Archer!

1489
01:53:37,350 --> 01:53:40,080
Stop the bus!
Stop the bus, stop the bus!

1490
01:53:40,152 --> 01:53:41,312
Come. Come, come.

1491
01:53:42,188 --> 01:53:43,883
Please, wait for us.

1492
01:53:43,956 --> 01:53:46,789
Madame Archer.
I was so worried. I thought...

1493
01:53:48,027 --> 01:53:49,961
It's wonderful to see you.

1494
01:53:50,029 --> 01:53:51,462
Come quickly.

1495
01:53:58,905 --> 01:54:01,271
- Carine?
- Anais?

1496
01:54:01,340 --> 01:54:02,568
Anais?

1497
01:54:02,642 --> 01:54:05,338
Just wait. It's gonna be
just a minute now.

1498
01:54:07,246 --> 01:54:09,680
Anais? Carine?

1499
01:54:24,363 --> 01:54:26,354
Oh, my God!

1500
01:54:27,667 --> 01:54:29,692
Oh, my God!

1501
01:54:29,769 --> 01:54:31,703
Come, come, come!

1502
01:54:35,241 --> 01:54:39,177
Hello, Carine. Anais, hello.
How are you, sweetheart?

1503
01:54:41,514 --> 01:54:43,175
Do you see your cousins?

1504
01:54:51,023 --> 01:54:53,389
They said there wasn't any room.

1505
01:54:53,459 --> 01:54:55,120
There's always room.
