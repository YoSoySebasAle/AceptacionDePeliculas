1
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,642
I was born 1911, Chickasaw County,
Piedmont Plantation.

2
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:31,104
And did you know,
as a girl growing up,

3
00:01:31,271 --> 00:01:32,689
that one day you'd be a maid?

4
00:01:33,523 --> 00:01:35,150
Yes, ma'am, I did.

5
00:01:35,316 --> 00:01:36,818
And you knew that because...

6
00:01:38,194 --> 00:01:41,489
My mama was a maid.
My grandmama was a house slave.

7
00:01:43,283 --> 00:01:46,661
House... slave.

8
00:01:48,747 --> 00:01:50,791
Do you ever dream
of being something else?

9
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,965
What does it feel like
to raise a white child

10
00:01:58,132 --> 00:02:00,926
when your own child's at home being
looked after by somebody else?

11
00:02:03,387 --> 00:02:05,264
It feel...

12
00:02:16,567 --> 00:02:20,029
I done raised 17 kids in my life.

13
00:02:20,196 --> 00:02:23,491
Looking after white babies,
that's what I do.

14
00:02:23,657 --> 00:02:26,577
Aibee, Aibee.

15
00:02:26,744 --> 00:02:28,787
- Hi!
- Aibee!

16
00:02:28,954 --> 00:02:33,042
I know how to get them babies to sleep,
stop crying and go in the toilet bow/

17
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:35,211
before their mamas even
get out of bed in the morning.

18
00:02:37,296 --> 00:02:38,839
Babies like fat.

19
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:41,967
They like big fat legs, too.
That I know.

20
00:02:42,134 --> 00:02:46,473
You is kind, you is smart...

21
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,892
...you is important.

22
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:51,520
- You is smart...
- Smart...

23
00:02:51,686 --> 00:02:54,231
...you is kind...
- ... you is kind...

24
00:02:54,397 --> 00:02:57,234
...you is important.
- ... you is important.

25
00:02:57,859 --> 00:02:59,819
That's so good.

26
00:03:02,197 --> 00:03:03,615
That's so good.

27
00:03:06,243 --> 00:03:09,537
I work for the Leefolts
from eight to four; six days a week.

28
00:03:09,704 --> 00:03:15,418
I make 95 cent an hour.
That comes to $182 every month.

29
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:22,008
I do all the cooking, cleaning, washing,
ironing and grocery shopping.

30
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,807
But mostly, I take care of Baby Girl.

31
00:03:30,141 --> 00:03:32,269
And, Lord, I worry she gonna be fat.

32
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:34,938
Mae Mobley.

33
00:03:35,105 --> 00:03:37,232
Ain't going to be
no beauty queen either.

34
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:41,028
Aibileen, bridge club is in an hour.
Did you finish the chicken salad?

35
00:03:41,195 --> 00:03:43,197
- Yes.
- Oh, and Hilly's deviled eggs.

36
00:03:43,364 --> 00:03:45,032
- No paprika.
- Mm-hm.

37
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:48,995
Does this dress look homemade?

38
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,332
I reckon when you finish it won't.

39
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,918
Well, thank you.

40
00:03:56,085 --> 00:04:00,089
Miss Leefolt still don't
pick Baby Girl up but once a day.

41
00:04:00,256 --> 00:04:03,634
The birthing blues got hold
of Miss Leefolt pretty hard.

42
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:06,095
I done seen it happen plenty of times,

43
00:04:06,262 --> 00:04:08,514
once babies start having
their own babies.

44
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:21,485
And the young
white ladies of Jackson...

45
00:04:21,652 --> 00:04:24,280
...oh Lord, was they having babies.

46
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,240
But not Miss Skeeter.

47
00:04:27,241 --> 00:04:29,243
No man and no babies.

48
00:05:02,152 --> 00:05:04,279
- Morning.
- Hi.

49
00:05:04,446 --> 00:05:06,531
- My name is Eugenia Phelan, and...
- Come on.

50
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,251
Eugenia Phelan, Mr. Blackly.

51
00:05:20,128 --> 00:05:22,297
Shut the damn door.

52
00:05:22,464 --> 00:05:25,927
I guarantee you, one day they're going
to figure out cigarettes will kill you.

53
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:28,471
OK, Miss Phelan,
let's see what you got.

54
00:05:32,475 --> 00:05:34,727

55
00:05:35,394 --> 00:05:37,772

Junior League: editor.

58
00:05:41,943 --> 00:05:45,238
- Damn, girl, don't you have fun?
- Is that important?

59
00:05:45,738 --> 00:05:47,698
- Do you have any references?
- Yes.

60
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:51,369
Right here.

61
00:05:53,913 --> 00:05:56,332
This...

62
00:05:56,499 --> 00:05:58,209
This is a rejection letter.

63
00:05:58,376 --> 00:06:00,920
Not exactly. See, Miss Stein thought...

64
00:06:01,087 --> 00:06:02,755
Stein?

65
00:06:02,922 --> 00:06:05,341
Elaine Stein, from Harper and Row
Publishing in New York.

66
00:06:05,508 --> 00:06:06,717
Oh, Lord.

67
00:06:06,884 --> 00:06:08,594
I'm gonna be a serious writer,
Mr. Blackly.

68
00:06:09,887 --> 00:06:12,306
I applied for a job,
but Mrs. Stein thought...

69
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:14,016
She said no.

70
00:06:14,183 --> 00:06:16,102
Well, until I gain some experience.

71
00:06:16,269 --> 00:06:17,603
See? Says right there.

72
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,316
"Great potential. Gain some experience
and please apply again. "

73
00:06:23,485 --> 00:06:26,613
Oh, Christ. I guess you'll do.
Do you clean?

74
00:06:27,155 --> 00:06:29,157
- I'm sorry. Clean?
- Clean.

75
00:06:29,324 --> 00:06:30,701
Grab that basket.

76
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,664
Miss Myrna has gone
shit-house crazy on us.

77
00:06:35,831 --> 00:06:38,292
She drunk hairspray or something.

78
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,711
I want you to read her past columns.

79
00:06:40,877 --> 00:06:43,547
Then read these letters and you
answer them just like she would.

80
00:06:43,714 --> 00:06:46,133
Nobody is gonna know
the damn difference.

81
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,302
You know who Miss Myrna is?

82
00:06:49,052 --> 00:06:50,721
I read her articles all the time.

83
00:06:50,887 --> 00:06:54,182
Articles? Miss Phelan,
it's a cleaning advice column.

84
00:06:54,349 --> 00:06:57,144
Eight bucks a week.
Copy is due on Thursday.

85
00:06:57,311 --> 00:06:59,980
Hello?

86
00:07:01,315 --> 00:07:04,985
Lou Ann, honey, I can't talk right now.
I'm at work.

87
00:07:05,152 --> 00:07:08,530
What? Shut that goddamn door.

88
00:07:24,088 --> 00:07:26,215
Mama, we're late for bridge!

89
00:07:26,382 --> 00:07:28,926
Miss Hilly was the first
of the babies to have a baby.

90
00:07:29,093 --> 00:07:30,636
...Three...

91
00:07:30,803 --> 00:07:33,514
And it must have come out of her like
the 11th Commandment,

92
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:35,933
'cause once Miss Hilly had a baby,

93
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,978
every girl at the bridge table
had to have one, too.

94
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:41,564
Minny, go get Mama!

95
00:07:47,612 --> 00:07:49,614
Missus Walters,
you need help coming down?

96
00:07:49,781 --> 00:07:51,240
- I'm down.
- Ooh.

97
00:07:51,407 --> 00:07:53,785
- I been down.
- Give me a heart attack.

98
00:07:53,951 --> 00:07:57,080
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Missus Walters.
Here, let me help you.

99
00:07:57,246 --> 00:08:00,208
Take that off.
It's 98 degrees out there.

100
00:08:00,374 --> 00:08:01,834
- Is it?
- Yes, ma'am.

101
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:03,669
Well, let's put my coat on then.

102
00:08:03,836 --> 00:08:05,880
- Come on, Minny.
- All right.

103
00:08:06,048 --> 00:08:07,508
- Here's your pocketbook.
- Thank you.

104
00:08:07,674 --> 00:08:09,301
OK, let me get the pie.

105
00:08:09,468 --> 00:08:11,929
Hold on, Missus Walters. Hold on.

106
00:08:13,972 --> 00:08:18,185
Once Missus Walters' arteries went hard,
Miss Hilly moved her into her house

107
00:08:18,352 --> 00:08:20,979
and fired the maid she had
to make room for Minny too.

108
00:08:22,147 --> 00:08:25,108
See, Minny about the best cook
in Mississippi,

109
00:08:25,275 --> 00:08:26,860
and Miss Hilly wanted her.

110
00:08:29,488 --> 00:08:32,574
I lost my own boy, Treelore,
four years ago.

111
00:08:33,867 --> 00:08:36,203
After that, I just didn't want
to live no more.

112
00:08:37,621 --> 00:08:40,123
It took God and Minny
to get me through it.

113
00:08:41,124 --> 00:08:45,629
Minn y my best friend.
Old lady like me lucky to have her.

114
00:08:49,716 --> 00:08:54,763
After my boy died, a bitter seed
was planted inside of me.

115
00:08:55,847 --> 00:08:58,725
And I just didn't feel
so accepting any more.

116
00:09:12,323 --> 00:09:13,408
No.

117
00:09:13,575 --> 00:09:16,911
You drunk up two glasses of grape juice.
I know you got to tee-tee.

118
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:17,996
No.

119
00:09:18,162 --> 00:09:20,456
I'll give you two cookies if you go.

120
00:09:24,502 --> 00:09:27,046
Mae Mobley, you're going!

121
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:30,425
Aibileen, the girls are
pulling up, and the table isn't set.

122
00:09:30,592 --> 00:09:33,094
Mae Mobley go, Mama.

123
00:09:33,261 --> 00:09:35,430
Get in your room right now.

124
00:09:37,181 --> 00:09:39,183
Set out the dessert forks. Please.

125
00:09:42,895 --> 00:09:45,481
Put Mama in a chair
before she breaks a hip.

126
00:09:45,648 --> 00:09:47,734
I'm not deaf yet, Hilly.

127
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,194
Hey, girls.

128
00:09:50,361 --> 00:09:55,868
Oh. Minny. Will you see if Aibileen
has some of that ambrosia?

129
00:10:01,206 --> 00:10:02,958
Hold on. Those are Miss Hilly's.

130
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:06,253
She looks like the winning
horse at the Kentucky Derby.

131
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,422
All flowers and bows.

132
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:10,090
Got to have paprika on them.

133
00:10:10,257 --> 00:10:11,800
Ooh.

134
00:10:11,967 --> 00:10:15,346
Forgive me, Lord, but I'm gonna have
to kill that woman, Aibileen.

135
00:10:15,512 --> 00:10:18,390
Now she gone to putting pencil marks
on my toilet paper.

136
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:21,268
- Did she?
- Mm-hm.

137
00:10:21,435 --> 00:10:25,105
But I carry paper in from my own
damn house. That fool don't know.

138
00:10:28,025 --> 00:10:30,110
Miss Leefolt got so much hairspray
on her head

139
00:10:30,277 --> 00:10:32,488
she gonna blow us all up
if she light a cigarette.

140
00:10:33,405 --> 00:10:35,491
And you know she will!

141
00:10:42,498 --> 00:10:44,333
- You got some ambrosia?
- You know I do.

142
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,043
All right, I'll be back.

143
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,171
Minny, cord, girl.

144
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,923
Shut up.

145
00:10:51,257 --> 00:10:53,593
The Guiding Light.

146
00:10:56,763 --> 00:10:58,515
Hi, Missus Walters.

147
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:01,017
I'm watching my story.

148
00:11:01,893 --> 00:11:02,936
OK.

149
00:11:03,103 --> 00:11:04,854
Isn't it gorgeous?

150
00:11:05,021 --> 00:11:06,022
Sorry I'm late.

151
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,318
You're home!

152
00:11:10,985 --> 00:11:12,570
I missed you all, too.

153
00:11:14,906 --> 00:11:18,201
Well, if it isn't "Long Haul" Skeeter.

154
00:11:18,368 --> 00:11:20,578
We didn't ever think
you'd leave Ole Miss.

155
00:11:20,745 --> 00:11:23,081
Well, it does take four years, Jolene.

156
00:11:24,374 --> 00:11:28,002
I've got a great summer planned for you.

157
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:29,379
Great.

158
00:11:29,546 --> 00:11:32,674
I went ahead and I picked up my black
dress from the cleaners this morning.

159
00:11:35,593 --> 00:11:36,594
What?

160
00:11:37,595 --> 00:11:40,014
- About supper club tonight.
- What?

161
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:43,978
Honey, Stuart had to cancel.

162
00:11:44,144 --> 00:11:45,521
Again?

163
00:11:45,688 --> 00:11:48,399
He got held up on the oil rig, Skeeter.

164
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:50,860
It's... It's offshore.

165
00:11:51,026 --> 00:11:54,822
I'm starting to think this Stuart
is a figment of your imagination,

166
00:11:54,989 --> 00:11:56,240
so just forget it.

167
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:58,284
I'm just gonna go get a plate.

168
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:00,661
- Shh!
- Sorry!

169
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:08,961
I got a job today.

170
00:12:11,088 --> 00:12:12,673
At The Jackson Journal.

171
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:17,136
They'd be a fool not to hire you.

172
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:20,556
To Skeeter and her job.

173
00:12:20,723 --> 00:12:22,474
Last stop till marriage.

174
00:12:23,058 --> 00:12:23,851
Oh!

175
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,107
- It's for the Miss Myrna column.
- Hmm.

176
00:12:30,274 --> 00:12:32,359
Elizabeth, can I talk to Aibileen?

177
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:36,281
Just to help me with some of the letters
till I get a knack for it.

178
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:39,200
My Aibileen?

179
00:12:40,118 --> 00:12:42,537
Why can't you just
get Constantine to help?

180
00:12:47,751 --> 00:12:50,211
Constantine quit us.

181
00:12:50,378 --> 00:12:52,881
Oh, my gosh. Skeeter, I'm so sorry.

182
00:12:53,048 --> 00:12:57,302
Anyway, I just, um... I don't really
know how to answer these letters.

183
00:12:57,969 --> 00:13:01,765
Well, I mean, as long as it doesn't
interfere with her work.

184
00:13:01,931 --> 00:13:03,767
I don't see why not.

185
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:12,984
Leefolt residence.

186
00:13:13,151 --> 00:13:15,111
Hello. Is Elizabeth in?

187
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:17,739
She having bridge club right now.
May I take a message?

188
00:13:17,906 --> 00:13:21,785
Yes, please tell her Celia Foote
called again.

189
00:13:22,952 --> 00:13:24,662
I'll call back tomorrow.

190
00:13:24,829 --> 00:13:26,873
- Yes, ma'am.
- Uh...

191
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,959
Miss?

192
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:33,464
I'm looking for some help at my house.
Do you know any maids looking?

193
00:13:33,631 --> 00:13:34,799
No, ma'am.

194
00:13:34,965 --> 00:13:37,468
OK. It's Celia Foote.

195
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:41,305
Emerson-684.
Bye now.

196
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:49,897
You scared the daylights out of me!

197
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:54,235
It is lunchtime,
and I am suddenly hungry.

198
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,657
Honestly!

199
00:14:04,995 --> 00:14:06,330
Oh.

200
00:14:06,497 --> 00:14:08,249
I'm still working on it, Aibileen.

201
00:14:11,836 --> 00:14:13,170
Who was that on the phone?

202
00:14:13,337 --> 00:14:15,422
Miss Celia Foote called again.

203
00:14:16,757 --> 00:14:18,634
I've never called her back, Hilly.

204
00:14:20,261 --> 00:14:22,430
She can't take a hint, can she?

205
00:14:22,597 --> 00:14:24,182
Who's Celia Foote?

206
00:14:24,349 --> 00:14:26,351
That tacky girl Johnny married.

207
00:14:26,518 --> 00:14:28,353
From Sugar Ditch.

208
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,063
It could have been you, Hilly.

209
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:35,569
And live 30 minutes outside of town?
No, thank you.

210
00:14:35,735 --> 00:14:40,657
Anyway, I ran into her at the beauty
parlor, and she had the nerve to ask

211
00:14:40,824 --> 00:14:42,868
if she could help with
the Children's Benefit Ball.

212
00:14:43,034 --> 00:14:46,204
Aren't we taking non-members?
The benefit has gotten so big.

213
00:14:46,371 --> 00:14:49,457
Yes, but we're not telling her.

214
00:14:52,168 --> 00:14:53,753
Thank you, Aibileen.

215
00:14:59,217 --> 00:15:01,052
Hilly, I wish you'd just
go use the bathroom.

216
00:15:01,219 --> 00:15:02,721
I'm fine.

217
00:15:02,888 --> 00:15:04,639
Oh, she's just upset

218
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:07,559
because the nigra uses the guest bath
and so do we.

219
00:15:11,062 --> 00:15:13,189
Aibileen, go check on Mae Mobley.

220
00:15:13,356 --> 00:15:14,441
Yes, ma'am.

221
00:15:15,651 --> 00:15:17,320
Just go use mine and Raleigh's.

222
00:15:17,486 --> 00:15:21,157
If Aibileen uses the guest bath,
I'm sure she uses yours, too.

223
00:15:21,324 --> 00:15:22,658
She does not.

224
00:15:23,576 --> 00:15:26,787
Wouldn't you rather them
take their business outside?

225
00:15:28,539 --> 00:15:31,042
Have you all seen the cover
of Life this week?

226
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,585
Jackie's never looked more regal.

227
00:15:32,752 --> 00:15:35,546
Tell Raleigh every penny he spends
on a colored's bathroom

228
00:15:35,713 --> 00:15:38,549
he'll get back in spades
when y'all sell.

229
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:44,096
it's just plain dangerous. They carry
different diseases than we do.

230
00:15:45,056 --> 00:15:46,057
Pass.

231
00:15:46,223 --> 00:15:49,352
That's why I've drafted
the Home Health Sanitation Initiative.

232
00:15:49,518 --> 00:15:50,811
The what?

233
00:15:50,978 --> 00:15:52,897
A disease-preventative bill

234
00:15:53,064 --> 00:15:57,485
that requires every white home to have a
separate bathroom for the colored help.

235
00:15:58,361 --> 00:16:00,696
It's been endorsed
by the White Citizens' Council.

236
00:16:04,617 --> 00:16:07,703
Maybe we should just build you
a bathroom outside, Hilly.

237
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,375
You ought not to joke
about the colored situation.

238
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:15,379
I'll do whatever it takes
to protect our children.

239
00:16:17,255 --> 00:16:19,132
Your lead, Elizabeth.

240
00:16:30,894 --> 00:16:32,396
- Aibileen?
- Yes, ma'am.

241
00:16:34,564 --> 00:16:37,484
Do you think you'd be willing to help me
with those Miss Myrna letters?

242
00:16:39,444 --> 00:16:42,072
Miss Myrna get it wrong a lot of times.
Be good to get it right.

243
00:16:44,908 --> 00:16:46,326
Thank you, Aibileen.

244
00:16:48,745 --> 00:16:50,330
All that talk in there today...

245
00:16:51,748 --> 00:16:52,999
Hilly's talk?

246
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,627
I'm sorry you had to hear that.

247
00:17:04,846 --> 00:17:06,931
Is that Preacher Green's sermon?

248
00:17:07,098 --> 00:17:09,183
Yes, ma'am, it is.

249
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:12,270
That reminds me so much of my maid,
Constantine.

250
00:17:13,563 --> 00:17:16,941
I know Constantine.
We're in church circle together.

251
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,901
Have you seen her lately?

252
00:17:20,194 --> 00:17:21,487
No, ma'am.

253
00:17:21,654 --> 00:17:23,197
Did you know that she had quit us?

254
00:17:23,364 --> 00:17:24,365
Quit?

255
00:17:24,532 --> 00:17:27,827
I got home from school a week ago,
and my mama told me she had quit.

256
00:17:27,994 --> 00:17:31,789
Back in March, she went to live with
her daughter, Rachel. In Chicago.

257
00:17:32,915 --> 00:17:34,959
Did you hear that?
Do you have her phone number?

258
00:17:35,126 --> 00:17:37,211
There you are, Skeeter.

259
00:17:39,338 --> 00:17:41,716
Hilly wants you to put her initiative
in the League newsletter.

260
00:17:41,883 --> 00:17:42,884
OK.

261
00:17:44,468 --> 00:17:46,053
I'll be back tomorrow, Aibileen,

262
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,806
to get started on those
Miss Myrna letters.

263
00:17:48,973 --> 00:17:50,141
Y'all make it quick.

264
00:17:50,308 --> 00:17:52,643
Tomorrow is silver-polishing day. OK?

265
00:18:11,663 --> 00:18:13,081
Hi, Jameso.

266
00:18:13,206 --> 00:18:14,499
How you, Miss Eugenia?

267
00:18:16,543 --> 00:18:17,544
Mama?

268
00:18:21,548 --> 00:18:23,008
Mama.

269
00:18:23,634 --> 00:18:25,510
Yoo-hoo.

270
00:18:36,104 --> 00:18:37,356
Mama?

271
00:18:37,522 --> 00:18:38,732
Back here, honey!

272
00:18:43,946 --> 00:18:45,656
Is this a little too young?

273
00:18:46,406 --> 00:18:48,283
That's a little too everything.

274
00:18:49,702 --> 00:18:51,412
Oh, hell. You're right.

275
00:19:07,095 --> 00:19:08,179
OK.

276
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,266
Much better.

277
00:19:13,226 --> 00:19:15,603
Your daddy bought me this dress in '58.

278
00:19:16,354 --> 00:19:18,231
Mama, I want to ask you
about Constantine.

279
00:19:18,356 --> 00:19:21,109
Right after Ole Miss won the Sugar Bowl.
Come on. You try it on.

280
00:19:21,234 --> 00:19:22,360
What really happened?

281
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:25,488
Skeeter, your mother is sick.
She wants to see you in this dress.

282
00:19:25,613 --> 00:19:26,614
Unzip me.

283
00:19:28,282 --> 00:19:29,367
Come on.

284
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:34,205
Did I tell you Fanny Peatrow
got engaged?

285
00:19:35,289 --> 00:19:37,125
After she got that teller job,

286
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,335
her mother said she was swimming
in proposals.

287
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,337
Good for fair Fanny Peatrow.

288
00:19:41,504 --> 00:19:44,758
Eugenia, your eggs are dying.
Would it kill you to go on a date?

289
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:49,638
Just show a little gumption.
Careful now, careful.

290
00:19:49,763 --> 00:19:52,099
Oh, now look at this.

291
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:55,978
This dress is just precious on you.

292
00:19:56,145 --> 00:20:00,149
Just take it in a little here.
Little there.

293
00:20:02,526 --> 00:20:05,279
- Get your hair fixed.
- I got a job today.

294
00:20:05,446 --> 00:20:06,447
Where?

295
00:20:07,114 --> 00:20:09,241
Writing for The Jackson Journal.

296
00:20:10,534 --> 00:20:12,870
Great.

297
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,789
You can write my obituary!

298
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:20,043
"Charlotte Phelan, dead!
Her daughter, still single. "

299
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,713
Mother, would it really be so bad
if I never met a husband?

300
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,632
Skeeter! Skeeter!

301
00:20:26,675 --> 00:20:28,135
Skeeter!

302
00:20:32,806 --> 00:20:34,183
I need to ask you something.

303
00:20:39,022 --> 00:20:42,984
I read the other day about how
some girls get unbalanced.

304
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,986
They start thinking these...

305
00:20:46,654 --> 00:20:48,656
...unnatural thoughts.

306
00:20:48,781 --> 00:20:50,158
Are you...

307
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:56,748
Do you, uh... find men attractive?

308
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:02,128
Are you having unnatural thoughts
about girls or women?

309
00:21:03,838 --> 00:21:04,964
Oh, my God.

310
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:09,802
Because this article says there's
a cure. A special root tea!

311
00:21:09,928 --> 00:21:15,308
Mother, I want to be with girls as much
as you want to be with Jameso.

312
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:17,685
- Eugenia!
- Unless, of course, you do!

313
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,187
Oh!

314
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:24,817
Carlton's bringing Rebecca to dinner.
Try to look presentable!

315
00:21:29,113 --> 00:21:31,241
What the hell you know
about cleaning a house, Skeeter?

316
00:21:31,408 --> 00:21:34,161
It's a start, Carlton.

317
00:21:34,286 --> 00:21:37,790
If you say so.
I thought you wanted to write books.

318
00:21:37,915 --> 00:21:41,043
Now, y'all leave Sister alone.

319
00:21:41,168 --> 00:21:44,046
- I'm proud of you, sweetheart.
- The irony of it all.

320
00:21:44,213 --> 00:21:46,507
Giving advice on how to keep up a home
when she doesn't even...

321
00:21:46,674 --> 00:21:50,135
Oh, no, Pascagoula. You couldn't have
known this, but I'm allergic to almonds.

322
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,013
Sorry, Miss Eugenia,
I'll get you another one.

323
00:21:53,138 --> 00:21:55,683
You know, last time I had an almond,
I stopped liking men.

324
00:21:55,849 --> 00:21:57,393
Oh, my Lord.

325
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:01,313
Oh, no, Rebecca, it's fine. There's
a special root tea for that now.

326
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,856
You have pushed it, young lady.

327
00:22:03,524 --> 00:22:06,652
Daddy. What happened to Constantine?

328
00:22:06,819 --> 00:22:09,113
Uh, well...

329
00:22:09,863 --> 00:22:13,242
Constantine went to live in Chicago
with her family.

330
00:22:13,367 --> 00:22:15,869
People move on, Skeeter.

331
00:22:16,036 --> 00:22:18,414
But I do wish that she'd
stayed down here with us.

332
00:22:23,419 --> 00:22:25,171
I don't believe you.

333
00:22:26,923 --> 00:22:29,342
She would've written and told me.

334
00:22:38,685 --> 00:22:40,311
Did you fire her?

335
00:22:40,979 --> 00:22:45,108
We were just a job to her, honey.
With them, it's all about money.

336
00:22:45,275 --> 00:22:48,778
You'll understand that once you've
hired help of your own.

337
00:22:49,571 --> 00:22:52,449
- She raised me.
- She did not!

338
00:22:52,574 --> 00:22:55,201
She worked here for 29 years!

339
00:22:55,326 --> 00:22:57,579
It was a colored thing
and I put it behind me!

340
00:22:58,288 --> 00:23:02,083
Excuse me a moment, Rebecca. My daughter
has upset my cancerous ulcers.

341
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:51,258
What you doing hiding out here, girl?

342
00:23:52,927 --> 00:23:56,305
I couldn't tell Mama I didn't
get asked to the dance.

343
00:23:56,472 --> 00:23:57,598
It's all right.

344
00:23:58,807 --> 00:24:02,311
Some things we just got to
keep to ourselves, right?

345
00:24:03,395 --> 00:24:05,231
All the boys say I'm ugly.

346
00:24:07,107 --> 00:24:11,237
Mama was third runner-up in
the Miss South Carolina pageant.

347
00:24:11,362 --> 00:24:15,033
I wish you'd quit
feeling sorry for yourself.

348
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,327
Now, that's ugly.

349
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:21,915
Ugly is something that
goes up inside you.

350
00:24:22,082 --> 00:24:25,543
It's mean and hurtful, like them boys.

351
00:24:26,878 --> 00:24:28,672
Now you're not one of them, is you?

352
00:24:29,714 --> 00:24:31,633
I didn't think so, honey.

353
00:24:36,846 --> 00:24:37,847
Every day...

354
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:42,644
Every day you're not
dead in the ground,

355
00:24:42,811 --> 00:24:47,399
when you wake up in the morning, you're
gonna have to make some decisions.

356
00:24:48,858 --> 00:24:51,278
Got to ask yourself this question:

357
00:24:51,987 --> 00:24:53,571
"Am I gonna believe

358
00:24:53,738 --> 00:24:58,410
all them bad things them fools
say about me today?"

359
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:01,454
You hear me?

360
00:25:01,621 --> 00:25:04,749
"Am I gonna believe all them bad things

361
00:25:04,916 --> 00:25:07,420
them fools say about me today'?"

362
00:25:10,297 --> 00:25:11,424
All right?

363
00:25:14,593 --> 00:25:18,431
As for your mama,
she didn't pick her life.

364
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,225
It picked her.

365
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,146
But you...

366
00:25:27,898 --> 00:25:31,569
...you're gonna do
something big with yours.

367
00:25:32,695 --> 00:25:34,280
You wait and see.

368
00:25:36,657 --> 00:25:39,618
Come on, go home with me
till the dance over. Come on.

369
00:26:00,974 --> 00:26:03,935
Miss Stein, you said in your letter
to write about what disturbs me,

370
00:26:04,102 --> 00:26:05,395
particularly if it bothers no one else.

371
00:26:05,562 --> 00:26:06,563
Come on.

372
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,523
And I understand that now.

373
00:26:09,941 --> 00:26:11,109
Continue.

374
00:26:12,194 --> 00:26:14,905
I'd like to write something
from the point of view of the help.

375
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,992
These colored women
raise white children,

376
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:22,454
and in 20 years,
those children become the boss.

377
00:26:22,621 --> 00:26:25,332
We love them and they love us,

378
00:26:25,499 --> 00:26:27,793
but they can't even use the toilets
in our houses.

379
00:26:27,959 --> 00:26:29,544
Don't you find that ironic, Miss Stein?

380
00:26:29,711 --> 00:26:30,712
I'm listening.

381
00:26:32,255 --> 00:26:34,841
Margaret Mitchell glorified
the mammy figure,

382
00:26:35,008 --> 00:26:36,676
who dedicates her whole life

383
00:26:36,843 --> 00:26:37,886
to a white family.

384
00:26:38,053 --> 00:26:41,431
But nobody ever asked Mammy
how she felt about it.

385
00:26:41,598 --> 00:26:44,351
So, a side to this never before heard?

386
00:26:44,518 --> 00:26:46,436
Yes.

387
00:26:46,603 --> 00:26:49,439
'Cause nobody ever really
talks about it down here.

388
00:26:52,275 --> 00:26:54,070
Skeeter, who are you
talking to in there?

389
00:26:55,112 --> 00:26:56,447
Go away!

390
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:03,037
- Who was that?
- My mother.

391
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,747
Look.

392
00:27:04,914 --> 00:27:08,376
No maid in her right mind is ever gonna
tell you the truth.

393
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:12,088
That's a hell of a risk to take in
a place like Jackson, Mississippi.

394
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,631
I already have a maid.

395
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:19,136
Really? A Negro maid has already agreed
to speak with you?

396
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,514
Yes, ma'am.

397
00:27:25,351 --> 00:27:28,354
Well... I guess I can read
what you come up with.

398
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,690
The book biz could use
a little rattling.

399
00:27:30,856 --> 00:27:32,233
Thank you, Miss Stein.

400
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,151
Hey, hey, hey, all I'm saying

401
00:27:34,318 --> 00:27:37,280
is that I'll let you know
if it's even worth pursuing.

402
00:27:37,446 --> 00:27:40,866
And for God's sake, you're
a 23-year-old educated woman.

403
00:27:41,033 --> 00:27:43,202
Go get yourself an apartment.

404
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,209
"Dear Miss Myrna:

405
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,838
When I'm chopping onions, how do I
keep tears out of my eyes?"

406
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:56,591
Shoot, that's easy. You tell
her hold a matchstick between her teeth.

407
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,594
Is it lit?

408
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,388
No, ma'am.

409
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:06,768
Miss Leefolt said
you could start right away.

410
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:11,898
Build it just like the bathroom
at my house. Let's see.

411
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:15,694
- Right there. That will be nice.
- Yes, ma'am.

412
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,535
My goodness, we got to run back
to the car. Come on.

413
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,454
Bye, Skeeter!

414
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,625
Aibileen.

415
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:34,421
There's something else I want to
write about. I would need your help.

416
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:41,679
I want to interview you about
what it's like to work as a maid.

417
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:45,141
I'd like to do a book of interviews
about working for white families.

418
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:49,687
And we could show what it's like
to work for, say, Elizabeth?

419
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:53,107
You know what Miss Leefolt do to me if
she knew I was telling stories on her?

420
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:56,402
I was thinking that we wouldn't
have to tell her.

421
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:59,447
The other maids would have
to keep it a secret, too.

422
00:28:59,614 --> 00:29:00,948
Other maids?

423
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:04,786
I was hoping to get four or five.

424
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:09,457
To show what it's really like
in Jackson.

425
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:17,465
Show what y'all get paid,
and the babies and the bathrooms.

426
00:29:17,632 --> 00:29:18,841
The good and the bad.

427
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:22,386
I bought you this damn house.
I put up with your new clothes

428
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:25,097
and trips to New Orleans,
but this takes the goddamn cake.

429
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:26,474
Hilly spoke to the surgeon general,

430
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:29,352
and she also said it'll add value
to our home.

431
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,355
I guess Mae Mobley can go to college
in that damn bathroom!

432
00:29:32,522 --> 00:29:33,774
Hilly's covering the cost and said

433
00:29:33,941 --> 00:29:35,776
you could just do William's taxes
to pay her back.

434
00:29:35,943 --> 00:29:37,986
We don't take orders
from the Holbrooks.

435
00:29:40,906 --> 00:29:42,783
Skeeter, how you doing?

436
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:45,244
Fine.

437
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:51,166
Fix me a sandwich, Aibileen.

438
00:29:54,503 --> 00:29:56,755
Aibileen, Mae Mobley's
crying her eyes out.

439
00:30:00,968 --> 00:30:02,594
Skeeter.

440
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:06,098
I'm sorry, but I think it's best
if you leave now.

441
00:30:06,265 --> 00:30:08,058
Oh, sure, sure.

442
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:11,979
And this Miss Myrna thing isn't going
to work out with Aibileen.

443
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:14,898
I'm sorry.

444
00:30:25,492 --> 00:30:29,038
You're making it hotter,
flapping your arms like that, Minny.

445
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:40,925
Look how big the waves are, Minny.

446
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:45,763
Let's go to the beach.
Run, get Mr. Walters!

447
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,640
He loves riding these waves!

448
00:30:47,807 --> 00:30:50,101
You know we went to Biloxi
on our honeymoon?

449
00:30:50,268 --> 00:30:51,728
Yes, ma'am.

450
00:30:52,645 --> 00:30:55,565
Are we in Biloxi, Minny?

451
00:30:56,733 --> 00:30:59,736
No, ma'am. We ain't.

452
00:31:03,114 --> 00:31:07,076
Why don't you sit down here for a spell.

453
00:31:08,286 --> 00:31:13,041
And then me and you will go on down
to the beach in a little while.

454
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:14,542
How about that?

455
00:31:27,014 --> 00:31:28,432
Uh...

456
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,351
Miss Hilly?

457
00:31:30,517 --> 00:31:32,102
Mm-hm?

458
00:31:34,646 --> 00:31:35,939
Never mind.

459
00:31:36,106 --> 00:31:38,984
You go on ahead and use
the inside bath, Minny, it's all right.

460
00:31:39,151 --> 00:31:42,071
Oh, for crying out loud,
it's just a little rain.

461
00:31:42,988 --> 00:31:45,783
She can go on up and get an umbrella
from William's study.

462
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:50,204
I believe she was working for me
before you dragged us both here.

463
00:31:53,791 --> 00:31:55,959
Daddy ruined you.

464
00:31:59,421 --> 00:32:01,298
I'm just gonna get your tea.

465
00:32:30,286 --> 00:32:31,496
Minny?

466
00:32:32,872 --> 00:32:34,541
Minny, are you in there?

467
00:32:36,584 --> 00:32:37,919
Yes, ma'am.

468
00:32:38,753 --> 00:32:41,005
And just what are you doing?

469
00:32:48,888 --> 00:32:50,557
Get off my toilet!

470
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:58,356
You are fired, Minny Jackson!

471
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,912
Go on!

472
00:33:21,422 --> 00:33:24,091
Eighteen people
died in Jackson that day.

473
00:33:25,384 --> 00:33:27,344
Ten white and eight black.

474
00:33:31,432 --> 00:33:35,811
God don't pay no mind to color once
He decide to set a tornado loose.

475
00:33:35,978 --> 00:33:38,897
Aibee's here, honey.

476
00:33:39,064 --> 00:33:40,608
Aibee's here.

477
00:34:02,422 --> 00:34:05,592
Hurry, Aibileen! Mae Mobley
is up, and I'm off to the doctor!

478
00:34:10,513 --> 00:34:14,726
That's Aibee's bathroom, Mama.
Hey, Aibee!

479
00:34:14,893 --> 00:34:17,354
No, no, no, honey.
Promise me you won't go in there, OK?

480
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,813
Yes, ma'am.

481
00:34:19,356 --> 00:34:20,857
I'm right here, Baby Girl.

482
00:34:22,901 --> 00:34:25,278
Isn't it so nice
to have your own, Aibileen?

483
00:34:25,445 --> 00:34:26,571
Yes, ma'am.

484
00:34:42,003 --> 00:34:45,590
You're my real mama, Aibee.

485
00:35:11,117 --> 00:35:13,452
- Is that Minny?
- Minny.

486
00:35:14,203 --> 00:35:16,038
Hey, Aibileen!

487
00:35:16,747 --> 00:35:17,748
Hey, Minny!

488
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:19,750
Mm-hmm.

489
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:21,085
Where you headed?

490
00:35:22,461 --> 00:35:25,506
I got some business to tend to,
so y'all just mind your own.

491
00:35:26,674 --> 00:35:28,134
All right, then. Well, bye!

492
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,094
Bye!

493
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:32,930
Now is she mad at me 'cause I got
that job at Miss Hilly's?

494
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:35,766
Don't worry about her.
She always mad about something.

495
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:39,228
Aibileen.

496
00:35:42,815 --> 00:35:44,817
Yes, ma'am. Everything OK?

497
00:35:44,984 --> 00:35:47,111
Yeah, I just wanted to talk to you.

498
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:50,323
You got some more
Miss Myrna questions for me?

499
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,158
Oh, no, I just wanted to talk about...

500
00:35:56,037 --> 00:35:58,456
We never finished our conversation
at Elizabeth's.

501
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:00,834
About that book I want to write?

502
00:36:15,724 --> 00:36:18,560
I'd really like
to interview you, Aibileen.

503
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:20,854
I know it's scary.

504
00:36:25,191 --> 00:36:27,819
They set my cousin
Shinelle's car on fire,

505
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:30,030
just 'cause she went down
to the voting station.

506
00:36:30,196 --> 00:36:32,449
A book like this has never
been written before.

507
00:36:32,616 --> 00:36:34,284
'Cause there's a reason.

508
00:36:34,451 --> 00:36:37,287
I do this with you, I might as well
burn my own house down.

509
00:36:37,454 --> 00:36:38,747
I promise we'll be careful.

510
00:36:38,914 --> 00:36:41,374
This already ain't careful,
Miss Skeeter!

511
00:36:46,631 --> 00:36:49,342
You not knowing that is what's
scaring me the most.

512
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:51,594
Scare me more than Jim Crow.

513
00:36:54,472 --> 00:36:55,640
All right.

514
00:36:56,432 --> 00:36:58,059
Here's my phone number.

515
00:37:01,687 --> 00:37:04,982
- My car's here. I could take you home.
- No, ma'am.

516
00:37:16,535 --> 00:37:20,331
"No person shall
require any white female

517
00:37:20,498 --> 00:37:24,919
to nurse in wards or rooms
in which Negro men are placed.

518
00:37:26,921 --> 00:37:32,259
Books shall not be interchangeable
between the white and colored schools,

519
00:37:33,469 --> 00:37:37,474
but shall continue to be used
by the race first using them.

520
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:45,107
No colored barber shall serve as
a barber to white women or girls.

521
00:37:47,067 --> 00:37:49,403
Any person printing, publishing

522
00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:51,405
or circulating written matter

523
00:37:51,571 --> 00:37:56,827
urging for public acceptance or social
equality between whites and Negroes

524
00:37:56,993 --> 00:37:59,121
is subject to imprisonment. "

525
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:01,373
Hello?

526
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,709
Aibileen, I done went and did it now.

527
00:38:05,752 --> 00:38:07,796
I went to Miss Hilly's house
this afternoon.

528
00:38:08,213 --> 00:38:09,464
Why Minny?

529
00:38:09,631 --> 00:38:12,926
She done told every white woman
in town I'm a thief

530
00:38:13,093 --> 00:38:15,554
Said I stole a candelabra.

531
00:38:17,722 --> 00:38:19,349
But I got her back.

532
00:38:19,516 --> 00:38:21,184
What you did?

533
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:23,854
I can't tell you.

534
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:27,232
I ain't telling nobody.

535
00:38:31,612 --> 00:38:35,449
I done something terrible awful
to that woman,

536
00:38:35,616 --> 00:38:38,202
and now she know what I done.

537
00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:39,662
Sorry.

538
00:38:43,958 --> 00:38:44,959
Minny.

539
00:38:45,126 --> 00:38:47,128
She got what she deserved, Aibileen.

540
00:38:48,462 --> 00:38:51,090
But now I ain't gonna never get
no job again.

541
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:55,344
Oh, Lord, Leroy gonna kill me.

542
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:02,560
Leroy?

543
00:39:04,896 --> 00:39:06,647
What you done did now, Minny?

544
00:39:08,232 --> 00:39:10,568
- Get off that phone, woman!
- Leroy, please!

545
00:39:10,735 --> 00:39:13,279
Minny? Minny!

546
00:39:13,446 --> 00:39:15,656
Please! Please!

547
00:39:15,823 --> 00:39:16,949
Come here!

548
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:29,171
Please open your Bibles to Exodus.

549
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:32,591
Chapter four, verse ten.

550
00:39:33,091 --> 00:39:37,638
God, having asked Moses
to free the Israelites...

551
00:39:39,431 --> 00:39:41,016
...Moses answered:

552
00:39:42,392 --> 00:39:46,730
"Oh, my Lord. I am not eloquent.

553
00:39:47,606 --> 00:39:51,860
I am slow of speech and slow of tongue. "

554
00:39:54,404 --> 00:39:58,784
See, courage isn't just
about being brave.

555
00:39:58,951 --> 00:39:59,993
Amen!

556
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,371
Courage is daring to do what is right

557
00:40:02,621 --> 00:40:05,457
in spite of the weakness of our flesh.

558
00:40:05,624 --> 00:40:08,001
And God tells us,

559
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:11,463
commands us, compels us,

560
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,882
- to love. Amen?
- Amen.

561
00:40:16,385 --> 00:40:17,762
See, love,

562
00:40:17,929 --> 00:40:21,557
as exemplified
by our Lord Jesus Christ,

563
00:40:21,724 --> 00:40:25,561
is to be prepared to put yourself
in harm's way

564
00:40:25,728 --> 00:40:27,689
for your fellow man.

565
00:40:27,855 --> 00:40:30,149
And by your fellow man,
I mean your brother,

566
00:40:30,525 --> 00:40:35,154
your sister, your neighbor,
your friend and your enemy.

567
00:40:35,321 --> 00:40:39,325
If you can love your enemy,
you already have the victory.

568
00:40:39,492 --> 00:40:41,577
Let's stand. All right.

569
00:41:03,182 --> 00:41:04,475
Quick. Come quick.

570
00:41:04,642 --> 00:41:07,895
I parked way up on State Street and
caught a cab here, like you asked.

571
00:41:08,062 --> 00:41:09,564
Got dropped two streets over?

572
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,191
Mm-hm.

573
00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:28,625
I know now that it's against the law,
what we're doing.

574
00:41:36,175 --> 00:41:37,968
I've never seen you
out of uniform before.

575
00:41:39,636 --> 00:41:41,430
You look really nice.

576
00:41:42,556 --> 00:41:43,765
Thank you.

577
00:42:02,075 --> 00:42:04,913
I ain't never had no white person
in my house before.

578
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,541
Miss Skeeter...

579
00:42:11,294 --> 00:42:15,965
...what if you don't like what I
got to say... about white people?

580
00:42:17,592 --> 00:42:19,302
This isn't about me.

581
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:22,555
It doesn't matter how I feel.

582
00:42:30,939 --> 00:42:34,108
You gonna have to change my name.
Mine, Miss Leefolt's. Everybody.

583
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:37,654
Do you have other maids
that are interested?

584
00:42:39,572 --> 00:42:41,574
That gonna be hard.

585
00:42:41,741 --> 00:42:43,409
What about Minny?

586
00:42:43,576 --> 00:42:45,161
Minny got her some stories,
sure enough,

587
00:42:45,328 --> 00:42:49,165
but she ain't real keen on talking
to white peoples right now.

588
00:42:52,335 --> 00:42:54,921
What does it feel like
to raise a white child

589
00:42:55,088 --> 00:42:57,967
when your own child's at home being
looked after by somebody else?

590
00:43:00,803 --> 00:43:02,346
It feel...

591
00:43:14,733 --> 00:43:15,943
Is that your son?

592
00:43:21,115 --> 00:43:22,992
Yes, ma'am.

593
00:43:23,158 --> 00:43:25,327
Can we move on to the next question?

594
00:43:25,494 --> 00:43:28,372
You don't have to call me ma'am.

595
00:43:28,956 --> 00:43:30,958
Not here.

596
00:43:36,922 --> 00:43:37,965
Uh...

597
00:43:38,132 --> 00:43:40,551
Do you want to talk about the bathroom?

598
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:44,346
Or anything about Miss Leefolt?

599
00:43:45,347 --> 00:43:49,977
How she pays you, or has she ever
yelled at you in front of Mae Mobley?

600
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:57,736
I thought I might write my stories down
and read them to you.

601
00:43:58,445 --> 00:44:00,530
Ain't no different than writing down
my prayers.

602
00:44:04,492 --> 00:44:05,910
OK.

603
00:44:07,454 --> 00:44:08,496
Sure.

604
00:44:15,879 --> 00:44:18,339
I don't say my prayers out loud.

605
00:44:18,506 --> 00:44:21,676
I can get my point across
a lot better writing them down.

606
00:44:21,843 --> 00:44:26,890
I write an hour,
sometimes two, every night.

607
00:44:27,056 --> 00:44:31,728
And after my prayers last night,
I got some stories down, too.

608
00:44:35,023 --> 00:44:36,316
Go ahead.

609
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:49,038
"My first white baby to ever look after

610
00:44:49,205 --> 00:44:52,416
was named Alton Carrington Speers.

611
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:56,629
It was 1925, and I had just turned 14.

612
00:44:57,296 --> 00:45:00,341
I dropped out of school
to help Mama with the bills.

613
00:45:00,508 --> 00:45:03,093
Alton's mama died of lung disease. "

614
00:45:06,722 --> 00:45:10,643
I loved that baby. And he loved me.

615
00:45:13,103 --> 00:45:16,190
That's when I learned I could make
children feel proud of theyself.

616
00:45:18,901 --> 00:45:22,363
Alton used to always be asking me
how come I was black.

617
00:45:22,529 --> 00:45:24,573
Just ate him up.

618
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:28,619
And one time, I told him it was because
I drank too much coffee.

619
00:45:32,831 --> 00:45:35,501
You should have seen his face.

620
00:45:47,847 --> 00:45:50,475
This was just so great.

621
00:45:52,435 --> 00:45:55,772
I can't tell you how much I appreciate
your doing this with me.

622
00:45:56,982 --> 00:45:58,733
What changed your mind?

623
00:46:00,443 --> 00:46:01,569
God.

624
00:46:03,697 --> 00:46:05,699
And Miss Hilly Holbrook.

625
00:46:18,878 --> 00:46:23,591
Miss Hilly, I would like to ask you
and Mr. William something.

626
00:46:27,012 --> 00:46:31,099
My twin boys graduated from high school,
both on the honor roll.

627
00:46:31,725 --> 00:46:35,229
Me and my husband, we been saving
for years to send them to Tougaloo.

628
00:46:37,189 --> 00:46:40,317
We're short about $75
on one of the tuitions.

629
00:46:42,361 --> 00:46:47,366
Whoo! I am late. I gotta get going.

630
00:46:50,286 --> 00:46:51,537
See you tonight, honey.

631
00:46:51,662 --> 00:46:52,747
OK.

632
00:46:55,124 --> 00:46:56,250
Go on.

633
00:46:59,754 --> 00:47:02,631
Well, now we're...

634
00:47:02,798 --> 00:47:05,551
...faced with having to choose

635
00:47:05,676 --> 00:47:08,304
which son can go if we don't
come up with the money.

636
00:47:09,513 --> 00:47:12,141
Would you consider giving us a loan?

637
00:47:12,892 --> 00:47:18,147
I'd work every day for free
till it was paid off.

638
00:47:18,272 --> 00:47:22,276
That's not working for free.
That's paying off a debt.

639
00:47:24,779 --> 00:47:26,281
Yes, ma'am.

640
00:47:30,202 --> 00:47:34,456
As a Christian, I'm doing you a favor.

641
00:47:36,208 --> 00:47:40,462
See, God don't give charity to those
who are well and able.

642
00:47:41,588 --> 00:47:45,425
You need to come up with this money
on your own. OK?

643
00:47:47,594 --> 00:47:49,679
Yes, ma'am.

644
00:47:49,804 --> 00:47:51,306
You'll thank me one day.

645
00:47:53,808 --> 00:47:57,187
You cooking white food,
you taste it with a different spoon.

646
00:47:57,896 --> 00:48:00,023
If they see you put the tasting spoon
back in the pot,

647
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:01,566
might as well throw it all out.

648
00:48:01,691 --> 00:48:02,901
Spoon, too.

649
00:48:03,026 --> 00:48:06,279
And you use the same cup, same fork,
same plate every day.

650
00:48:06,404 --> 00:48:08,031
And you put it up in the cabinet.

651
00:48:08,156 --> 00:48:10,909
You tell that white woman that's where
you're gonna keep it from now on out.

652
00:48:11,034 --> 00:48:12,869
Don't do it and see what happens.

653
00:48:12,994 --> 00:48:14,704
Morning, ladies.

654
00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:16,498
When you're sewing white folks coffee,

655
00:48:16,665 --> 00:48:17,999
set it down in front of them.

656
00:48:18,124 --> 00:48:20,836
Don't hand it to them,
'cause your hands can't touch.

657
00:48:21,587 --> 00:48:24,340
And don't hit on they children.

658
00:48:24,465 --> 00:48:27,051
White folks like to do
they own spanking.

659
00:48:28,302 --> 00:48:30,805
And last thing. Come here.

660
00:48:32,098 --> 00:48:33,349
Look at me.

661
00:48:33,474 --> 00:48:35,851
No Sass-mouthing.

662
00:48:37,937 --> 00:48:40,314
No Sass-mouthing.

663
00:48:40,481 --> 00:48:42,233
I mean it.

664
00:48:47,405 --> 00:48:48,781
Give your mama a kiss.

665
00:48:51,409 --> 00:48:55,913
Leroy had made Sugar quit
school to help him with the bills.

666
00:48:59,792 --> 00:49:03,212
And every day Minny
went without a job,

667
00:49:03,379 --> 00:49:06,132
might have been a day Leroy
took her from our world.

668
00:49:10,594 --> 00:49:12,346
Good morning, everybody.

669
00:49:19,229 --> 00:49:20,522
But I knew.

670
00:49:20,689 --> 00:49:24,985
I knew the only white lady Miss Hilly
hadn't gotten to with her lies.

671
00:49:33,368 --> 00:49:35,120
Hey!

672
00:49:35,245 --> 00:49:38,290
Come on!

673
00:49:38,457 --> 00:49:42,961
No sass-mouthing, Minny Jackson.
No Sass-mouthing.

674
00:49:44,838 --> 00:49:47,466
Aibileen said you'd be on time.

675
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,597
I'm Celia Rae Foote.

676
00:49:53,764 --> 00:49:55,432
I'm Minny Jackson.

677
00:49:57,059 --> 00:50:00,103
You, uh... cooking something?

678
00:50:01,313 --> 00:50:04,733
One of those upside-down cakes
from a magazine.

679
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:08,654
It ain't working out too good.
Come on, let's get you a cold Coca-Cola.

680
00:50:11,365 --> 00:50:12,366
Come on.

681
00:50:14,494 --> 00:50:16,537
This here is the kitchen.

682
00:50:17,789 --> 00:50:20,082
What in the hell?

683
00:50:23,461 --> 00:50:25,880
I guess I got some learning to do.

684
00:50:26,631 --> 00:50:29,675
You sure do.

685
00:50:29,842 --> 00:50:32,887
Johnny's grandmama left him this house
when she died.

686
00:50:33,054 --> 00:50:36,057
And then Johnny's mama
wouldn't let me change a thing.

687
00:50:36,224 --> 00:50:38,226
But if I had it my way,

688
00:50:38,392 --> 00:50:43,272
this place would be wall-to-wall
white carpet with gold trim.

689
00:50:43,439 --> 00:50:45,608
None of this old stuff.

690
00:50:45,775 --> 00:50:48,069
The main house has
five beds and baths,

691
00:50:48,236 --> 00:50:52,532
and then the pool house has
two more beds and baths.

692
00:50:52,698 --> 00:50:54,867
When y'all gonna start
having some children,

693
00:50:55,034 --> 00:50:57,161
filling up all these empty beds?

694
00:50:59,288 --> 00:51:01,917
- I'm pregnant now.
- Oh.

695
00:51:02,084 --> 00:51:05,587
Gonna be eating for two.
That's double the cooking.

696
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:09,508
I know. It's an awful lotto do.

697
00:51:10,551 --> 00:51:13,679
Five other maids have
already turned me down.

698
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:17,266
Let me at least get you some bus money.

699
00:51:17,432 --> 00:51:20,852
Now, uh... when did you hear me say
I don't want to clean this house?

700
00:51:22,104 --> 00:51:25,357
Wait. So you'll do it?

701
00:51:31,905 --> 00:51:33,615
Ooh. No hugging. No hugging.

702
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:39,121
I'm sorry. This is the first time
I've hired a maid.

703
00:51:40,038 --> 00:51:41,582
Come on.

704
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:51,300
- You hungry?
- No, ma'am. Hold on a minute.

705
00:51:51,466 --> 00:51:53,510
We gots to talk about
some things first.

706
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,557
Oh.

707
00:51:57,724 --> 00:51:59,350
I work Sunday through Friday.

708
00:51:59,517 --> 00:52:02,520
No, you can't work at all
on the weekends.

709
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:06,065
OK. What time you want me here?

710
00:52:07,233 --> 00:52:11,070
After 9:00, and you gotta leave
before 4:00.

711
00:52:12,238 --> 00:52:13,406
OK.

712
00:52:13,573 --> 00:52:15,283
Now...

713
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:17,035
What your husband say you can pay?

714
00:52:18,703 --> 00:52:20,788
Johnny doesn't know
I'm bringing in help.

715
00:52:20,955 --> 00:52:23,041
And what Mr. Johnny gonna do
when he come home

716
00:52:23,207 --> 00:52:25,376
and find a colored woman in his house?

717
00:52:25,543 --> 00:52:28,338
It's not like I'd be fibbing.

718
00:52:28,504 --> 00:52:30,923
I just want him to think I can do this
on my own.

719
00:52:33,009 --> 00:52:35,386
I really need a maid.

720
00:52:37,388 --> 00:52:39,766
I'll be here tomorrow morning
about 9:15.

721
00:52:41,893 --> 00:52:43,019
Great.

722
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:48,692
- Miss Celia?
- Hmm?

723
00:52:49,276 --> 00:52:51,153
I think you done burned up your cake.

724
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:55,574
Doggone it!

725
00:53:01,497 --> 00:53:03,999
OK, let's see.
What's first up on the agenda?

726
00:53:05,125 --> 00:53:10,297
We are running behind on our coat drive.
Hurry up and clean out those closets.

727
00:53:10,464 --> 00:53:15,511
But our Christmas benefit, however,
is right on schedule. Mary Beth?

728
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:21,433
Well, thanks to y'all, I can announce
that we already filled

729
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,645
every raffle slot for baked goods!

730
00:53:27,064 --> 00:53:30,567
Think we can put a dent in
African children's hunger this year?

731
00:53:31,652 --> 00:53:33,737
A big dent!

732
00:53:37,032 --> 00:53:38,033
Now...

733
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,828
...I just found out
the surgeon general

734
00:53:40,994 --> 00:53:44,374
has reviewed the Home Health
Sanitation Initiative that I drafted,

735
00:53:44,541 --> 00:53:48,545
and he passed it along
to Governor Barnett!

736
00:53:49,295 --> 00:53:52,715
Skeeter, when can we expect to see
the initiative in the newsletter?

737
00:53:52,882 --> 00:53:54,551
I gave it to you a month ago.

738
00:53:54,717 --> 00:53:56,636
I gave that to you myself.

739
00:53:56,803 --> 00:53:59,764
Would you please stand, Skeeter?

740
00:54:04,644 --> 00:54:06,563
I'll have it in there real soon.

741
00:54:09,566 --> 00:54:10,817
Great.

742
00:54:19,158 --> 00:54:21,536
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

743
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:30,461
Thanks.

744
00:54:35,509 --> 00:54:38,721
Hilly, I really am sorry
about the newsletter.

745
00:54:38,887 --> 00:54:41,181
It's just with Mama being sick and all.

746
00:54:43,142 --> 00:54:44,852
Oh, it's fine.

747
00:54:47,229 --> 00:54:49,565
I made you the egg and olive on rye,
Miss Skeeter.

748
00:54:49,732 --> 00:54:52,109
Oh, thank you, Henry.

749
00:54:52,276 --> 00:54:53,777
You remembered.

750
00:54:53,944 --> 00:54:55,279
You're welcome.

751
00:54:57,781 --> 00:54:59,783
Oh, Hilly, tell her.
I can hardly stand it.

752
00:55:00,659 --> 00:55:03,245
He's coming.

753
00:55:03,412 --> 00:55:06,832
Oh, Skeeter, Stuart's definitely
coming this time. Next Saturday week.

754
00:55:06,999 --> 00:55:11,754
Well, he's canceled twice before.
Don't you think maybe that's a sign?

755
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,256
Don't you dare say that.

756
00:55:14,423 --> 00:55:16,175
You know I'm not gonna be his type.

757
00:55:16,342 --> 00:55:18,552
Damn it, Skeeter, I'm not gonna
let you miss out on this

758
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:21,930
because your mother convinced you you're
not good enough for somebody like him.

759
00:55:25,976 --> 00:55:27,811
Saturday night.

760
00:56:05,975 --> 00:56:08,645
Good morning.

761
00:56:08,812 --> 00:56:11,731
Good morning, Baby Girl.

762
00:56:11,898 --> 00:56:14,192
Good morning.

763
00:56:26,664 --> 00:56:28,958
I reckon I'm ready to talk about
Miss Leefolt now.

764
00:56:32,044 --> 00:56:35,214
Baby Girl still gotta wear a diaper
when she sleep at night.

765
00:56:35,381 --> 00:56:37,633
And it don't get changed till
I get there in the morning.

766
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,636
That about ten hours
she gotta sleep in her mess.

767
00:56:41,971 --> 00:56:44,557
Now Miss Leefolt pregnant
with her second baby.

768
00:56:45,391 --> 00:56:48,727
Lord... I pray this child
turn out good.

769
00:56:49,645 --> 00:56:52,439
It's a lonely road if a mama
don't think their child is pretty.

770
00:56:55,401 --> 00:56:57,236
That's very true.

771
00:57:01,115 --> 00:57:03,075
Miss Leefolt should not
be having babies.

772
00:57:07,538 --> 00:57:08,664
Write that down.

773
00:57:15,796 --> 00:57:18,466
Treelore would like me doing this.

774
00:57:18,633 --> 00:57:21,428
He always said we were gonna have
a writer in the family one day.

775
00:57:21,595 --> 00:57:24,014
I always thought it was gonna be him.
Maybe it's gonna be me.

776
00:57:25,098 --> 00:57:27,058
Aibileen, Aibileen.

777
00:57:27,225 --> 00:57:30,020
They done set a bomb off
in Medgar Evers' carport.

778
00:57:38,528 --> 00:57:42,324
Yule Mae told me what y'all was up to.
I didn't want to believe it.

779
00:57:45,118 --> 00:57:48,163
And just what makes you think
colored people need your help?

780
00:57:49,289 --> 00:57:50,874
- Why do you care?
- Minny.

781
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:52,834
Maybe you just want
to get Aibileen in trouble.

782
00:57:53,001 --> 00:57:54,586
No.

783
00:57:54,753 --> 00:57:57,130
I want to show her perspective.

784
00:57:57,297 --> 00:58:00,967
So people might understand
what it's like from your side.

785
00:58:01,134 --> 00:58:03,803
Well, it's a real Fourth of July picnic.

786
00:58:04,387 --> 00:58:07,641
It's what we dream of doing
all weekend long.

787
00:58:07,807 --> 00:58:10,561
Get back into they house,
polish the silver.

788
00:58:10,728 --> 00:58:15,316
And we just love not making minimum wage
or getting Social Security.

789
00:58:17,276 --> 00:58:20,196
And how we love they children
when they little.

790
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:24,158
And then they turn out
just like they mamas.

791
00:58:24,325 --> 00:58:25,368
I know.

792
00:58:27,411 --> 00:58:28,913
Maybe things can change.

793
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:31,165
What law's gonna say you
gotta be nice to your maid?

794
00:58:31,332 --> 00:58:32,875
You don't have to do this now, Minny.

795
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:34,669
You damn right I don't!

796
00:58:35,503 --> 00:58:37,546
You two give me the heart palpitations.

797
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:43,135
And that's a good mood.

798
00:58:55,272 --> 00:58:57,691
All right. I'm gonna do it.

799
00:58:57,858 --> 00:59:01,821
But I need to make sure she understands
this ain't no game we playing here.

800
00:59:03,865 --> 00:59:06,493
Slide your chair out from under
that table. Face me.

801
00:59:09,287 --> 00:59:13,041
I need to see you square on
at all times.

802
00:59:22,759 --> 00:59:24,344
I gotta come up with
your questions, too?

803
00:59:24,511 --> 00:59:25,595
Oh.

804
00:59:26,972 --> 00:59:31,184
Uh, let's begin
with where you were born.

805
00:59:31,351 --> 00:59:35,105
Belzoni, Mississippi,
on my great-auntie's sofa.

806
00:59:35,272 --> 00:59:36,398
Next.

807
00:59:36,565 --> 00:59:38,900
- I put the green beans in first.
- OK.

808
00:59:39,067 --> 00:59:42,195
Then I get on the pork chops so I can
get started on that cornbread.

809
00:59:42,362 --> 00:59:45,866
Once Minny got to talking
about food, she liked to never stop.

810
00:59:47,617 --> 00:59:51,329
And when she got to talking about
the white ladies, it took all night.

811
00:59:51,496 --> 00:59:56,001
Then she say, "Oh, Minny,
I'm gonna give you a paid vacation. "

812
00:59:56,168 --> 00:59:58,713
I ain't never had no paid vacation
in my life.

813
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,465
A week later I come back,
and they done moved to Mobile.

814
01:00:02,842 --> 01:00:06,053
Miss Lazy Fingers scared I'd find
a new job before she moved.

815
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:08,264
Ain't that right, Aibileen?

816
01:00:13,978 --> 01:00:15,605
We gots to get some more maids.

817
01:00:16,647 --> 01:00:19,108
It hard. You go try and see.

818
01:00:21,402 --> 01:00:22,904
OK, I will.

819
01:00:29,368 --> 01:00:30,745
We gone and done it now.

820
01:00:33,331 --> 01:00:38,502
Skeeter! Get down here! Something just
arrived from New York for you.

821
01:00:54,102 --> 01:00:55,103
What is that?

822
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:58,941
The Shinalator.
All the way from New York City.

823
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:02,653
I'm a good mother.
Come on. Sit down.

824
01:01:04,237 --> 01:01:09,451
The whole system cost 11 dollars.
Even smells expensive.

825
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:14,539
You're gonna look beautiful
on your date tonight.

826
01:01:14,706 --> 01:01:17,042
I can feel the hope in your fingers.

827
01:01:20,045 --> 01:01:22,047
Holy shit.

828
01:01:22,214 --> 01:01:24,800
- You shrunk five inches.
- Oh, my God.

829
01:01:24,966 --> 01:01:27,010
You'll be able to wear heels tonight.

830
01:01:27,844 --> 01:01:31,181
You're not leaving the house in those
awful Mexican man shoes.

831
01:01:31,348 --> 01:01:32,432
Can I take the Cadillac?

832
01:01:32,599 --> 01:01:35,018
We promised the Cadillac
to Carlton and Rebecca tonight,

833
01:01:35,185 --> 01:01:38,313
so William's cousin will just
have to come pick you up himself.

834
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,066
- I'll take the truck.
- It's hooked up to the motor grader.

835
01:01:41,233 --> 01:01:42,234
I'll drive slow.

836
01:01:42,401 --> 01:01:45,154
Skeeter! Skeeter!

837
01:01:45,321 --> 01:01:50,159
Now remember, no gentleman wants
to spend the evening with a sourpuss.

838
01:01:50,326 --> 01:01:53,579
Don't mope! Smile!

839
01:01:53,746 --> 01:01:59,085
And for heaven's sakes, don't sit like
some squaw Indian! Cross your ankles!

840
01:02:00,294 --> 01:02:01,754
I love you!

841
01:02:11,222 --> 01:02:12,807
Stuart, she'll be here any minute.

842
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:15,643
Hey. -

843
01:02:17,979 --> 01:02:19,313
Skeeter.

844
01:02:21,649 --> 01:02:25,695
Boys, we'll be right back. Y'all talk
about quarterbacks or something.

845
01:02:25,862 --> 01:02:27,655
Yule Mae, get Miss Skeeter a Coca-Cola.

846
01:02:27,822 --> 01:02:28,990
Yes, ma'am.

847
01:02:43,213 --> 01:02:44,214
Want a drink?

848
01:02:44,381 --> 01:02:46,175
Just water, please.

849
01:02:47,634 --> 01:02:51,597
Double Old Kentucky, straight
with a water back. Make that two backs.

850
01:02:51,763 --> 01:02:54,641
You sure you don't want to just make it
the whole bottle and a straw?

851
01:02:55,434 --> 01:02:58,103
Honey, there's the lieutenant governor.
Let's go say hi.

852
01:03:02,566 --> 01:03:05,068
Good to see you, sir.
You remember my wife?

853
01:03:05,235 --> 01:03:06,445
Hi, how are you? Good to see you.

854
01:03:11,533 --> 01:03:14,828
So, what do you do with your time?

855
01:03:15,996 --> 01:03:17,039
You work?

856
01:03:17,831 --> 01:03:19,249
I write.

857
01:03:20,292 --> 01:03:22,794
But right now I'm working on
a domestic maintenance column

858
01:03:22,961 --> 01:03:24,046
for The Jackson Journal.

859
01:03:26,173 --> 01:03:27,341
You mean housekeeping.

860
01:03:28,508 --> 01:03:32,055
Jesus, I can't think of anything worse
than reading a cleaning column,

861
01:03:32,222 --> 01:03:34,057
except for maybe writing one.

862
01:03:34,224 --> 01:03:35,767
Well, I can.

863
01:03:35,934 --> 01:03:40,021
Working with a bunch of greasy,
stinky men in the middle of the ocean.

864
01:03:40,188 --> 01:03:43,691
It sounds like a ploy to find a husband,
becoming an expert in keeping house.

865
01:03:43,858 --> 01:03:47,487
Well, aren't you a genius?
You figured out my whole scheme.

866
01:03:47,654 --> 01:03:50,865
Isn't that what all you girls
from Ole Miss major in...

867
01:03:51,032 --> 01:03:52,742
...professional husband hunting?

868
01:03:52,909 --> 01:03:55,828
Who is hungry?

869
01:03:55,995 --> 01:03:59,582
I'm sorry, but were you dropped
on your head as an infant?

870
01:03:59,749 --> 01:04:01,334
Or were you just born stupid?

871
01:04:23,189 --> 01:04:25,234
So, what can you cook?

872
01:04:26,527 --> 01:04:29,822
Oh, um, I can cook cornpone.

873
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:32,491
Boil potatoes.

874
01:04:33,534 --> 01:04:34,618
I can do grits.

875
01:04:38,163 --> 01:04:39,206
Well...

876
01:04:40,124 --> 01:04:44,044
...I reckon if there's anything you
ought to know about cooking, it's this.

877
01:04:44,211 --> 01:04:47,297
The most important invention since
they put mayonnaise in a jar.

878
01:04:49,466 --> 01:04:51,427
You got gum in your hair,

879
01:04:51,593 --> 01:04:53,804
you got a squeaky door hinge...

880
01:04:53,971 --> 01:04:54,972
Crisco.

881
01:04:56,724 --> 01:04:58,350
How pretty.

882
01:05:00,269 --> 01:05:02,187
Looks like frosting.

883
01:05:02,354 --> 01:05:05,232
You got bags under your eyes.

884
01:05:05,399 --> 01:05:07,359
Want to soften your husband's
scaly feet.

885
01:05:08,485 --> 01:05:10,112
Mm-hm. Crisco.

886
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:14,575
But it's best for frying chicken.

887
01:05:15,826 --> 01:05:17,494
Frying chicken just...

888
01:05:18,662 --> 01:05:20,749
...tend to make you
feel better about life.

889
01:05:24,294 --> 01:05:25,712
At least me, anyway.

890
01:05:27,088 --> 01:05:29,757
Mm, I love me some fried chicken.

891
01:05:31,342 --> 01:05:32,427
Now...

892
01:05:34,471 --> 01:05:35,472
...shake that.

893
01:05:35,638 --> 01:05:37,140
Oh.

894
01:05:41,978 --> 01:05:44,814
This is so much fun!

895
01:05:46,232 --> 01:05:49,694
All right, all right.
The chicken already dead, Miss Celia.

896
01:05:53,448 --> 01:05:54,824
Yep. He dead.

897
01:06:06,002 --> 01:06:07,337
There you are.

898
01:06:08,671 --> 01:06:13,552
I'm starved. Looks so good.

899
01:06:14,094 --> 01:06:15,804
We done been over this, Miss Celia.

900
01:06:15,971 --> 01:06:19,850
You supposed to eat in the dining room.
That's how it works.

901
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:21,185
Let me take your plate back.

902
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:23,938
I'm fine right here, Minny.

903
01:06:43,457 --> 01:06:44,458
What?

904
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:48,128
I just want you to know
I'm real grateful you're here.

905
01:06:48,295 --> 01:06:51,048
You gots plenty more
to be grateful for than me.

906
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:55,803
And look, now I ain't
messing around no more.

907
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:57,263
Now Mr. Johnny gonna catch me here,

908
01:06:57,429 --> 01:07:00,266
and shoot me dead right here
on this no-wax floor.

909
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:02,393
You gots to tell him.

910
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:05,396
Ain't he wondering how
the cooking's so good?

911
01:07:05,562 --> 01:07:07,190
You're right.

912
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:11,027
Maybe we ought to
burn the chicken a little.

913
01:07:13,113 --> 01:07:14,781
Minny don't burn chicken.

914
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:21,121
I like this Sarah Ross. She testifies
without complaining too much.

915
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:24,916
And that Bertha,
she's got chutzpah, I'll give her that.

916
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:26,418
So you liked it?

917
01:07:26,584 --> 01:07:29,212
Eugenia, Martin Luther King
just invited

918
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:32,340
the entire country to march with him
in D.C. in August.

919
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:33,842
This many Negroes and whites

920
01:07:34,009 --> 01:07:36,386
have not worked together since
Gone with the Wind.

921
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:39,305
How many stories have you
recorded thus far?

922
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:41,474
The ones you've read.

923
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:43,476
Two domestics, that's all?

924
01:07:45,729 --> 01:07:47,647
I'm real close to
getting more interviews.

925
01:07:47,814 --> 01:07:51,818
Don't send me anything else
until you do have more maids.

926
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:54,821
Yes, ma'am. How... how many more?

927
01:07:54,988 --> 01:07:57,866
I don't know. At least a dozen.

928
01:07:58,032 --> 01:08:01,370
My advice to you is to write it
and write it fast

929
01:08:01,537 --> 01:08:03,873
before this whole civil rights thing
blows over.

930
01:08:04,039 --> 01:08:05,708
Now good night to you, Miss Phelan.

931
01:08:18,179 --> 01:08:20,222
We need a dozen more.

932
01:08:21,056 --> 01:08:25,311
Me and Aibileen done asked everybody
we know. Thirty-one maids.

933
01:08:26,228 --> 01:08:28,272
They all too scared. Think we crazy.

934
01:08:30,149 --> 01:08:32,276
If we don't get more,
we're not getting published.

935
01:08:32,443 --> 01:08:35,404
I gots plenty stories,
Miss Skeeter.

936
01:08:35,571 --> 01:08:39,158
Just write them down
and invent the maid that said it.

937
01:08:39,325 --> 01:08:41,869
You're already making up names.
Just make up the maids, too.

938
01:08:42,036 --> 01:08:45,956
We're not gonna do that.
That would be wrong.

939
01:08:46,123 --> 01:08:47,458
Don't give up on this, Miss Skeeter.

940
01:08:47,625 --> 01:08:49,251
It wouldn't be real.

941
01:08:50,794 --> 01:08:52,338
They Killed my son.

942
01:09:00,138 --> 01:09:02,390
He fell carrying two-by-fours
at the mill.

943
01:09:03,975 --> 01:09:06,144
Truck run over him, crushed his lung.

944
01:09:06,311 --> 01:09:07,896
Aibileen.

945
01:09:11,233 --> 01:09:13,985
That white foreman threw his body
on back of a truck.

946
01:09:14,778 --> 01:09:17,656
Drove to the colored hospital...

947
01:09:17,822 --> 01:09:19,783
...dumped him there and honked the horn.

948
01:09:30,252 --> 01:09:34,464
There was nothing they could do,
so I brought my baby home.

949
01:09:39,219 --> 01:09:41,471
Laid him down on that sofa right there.

950
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:47,103
He died right in front of me.

951
01:09:49,689 --> 01:09:53,317
He was just 24 years old, Miss Skeeter.
Best part of a person's life.

952
01:09:54,944 --> 01:09:58,531
Anniversary of his death comes...

953
01:09:58,698 --> 01:10:01,075
...every year, and I can't breathe.

954
01:10:01,242 --> 01:10:03,452
But to y'all, it's just
another day of bridge.

955
01:10:07,915 --> 01:10:09,375
You stop this...

956
01:10:10,668 --> 01:10:14,463
...everything I wrote, he wrote,
everything he was is gonna die with him.

957
01:10:24,682 --> 01:10:27,893
I am just honored
to be hosting Elizabeth's shower.

958
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:30,271
Doesn't she look glowing, everybody?

959
01:10:30,438 --> 01:10:32,898
Yes, she does!

960
01:10:33,065 --> 01:10:35,484
Honey, you hold on to it,
to the bitter end.

961
01:10:37,153 --> 01:10:39,196
- I'll try.
- Well, congratulations.

962
01:10:41,241 --> 01:10:43,326
I'm hungry, Mommy.

963
01:10:43,493 --> 01:10:44,661
She's always hungry.

964
01:10:47,664 --> 01:10:49,249
You know she can hear you, Elizabeth.

965
01:10:49,416 --> 01:10:53,670
I'll cut you
a piece of cake, baby. Go on, now.

966
01:10:57,716 --> 01:11:02,554
Aibileen, are you enjoying your new
bathroom over at Elizabeth's'?

967
01:11:02,721 --> 01:11:06,475
Nice to have your own.
Isn't it, Aibileen?

968
01:11:11,021 --> 01:11:14,316
Yes, ma'am. And I thank you.

969
01:11:14,483 --> 01:11:17,152
Separate, but equal.

970
01:11:17,861 --> 01:11:20,280
That's what Ross Barnett says,
and you can't argue with the governor.

971
01:11:20,447 --> 01:11:24,659
Well, certainly not in Mississippi,
the birthplace of modern-day government.

972
01:11:41,010 --> 01:11:44,430
Hey, Miss Skeeter.
Can I get you something?

973
01:11:44,597 --> 01:11:45,598
No, thanks.

974
01:11:46,891 --> 01:11:49,268
Yule Mae, I wanted to talk to you
about something.

975
01:11:51,854 --> 01:11:54,023
I already know what you're gonna ask,
Miss Skeeter.

976
01:11:56,651 --> 01:11:58,402
Minny and Aibileen already did.

977
01:12:03,574 --> 01:12:06,160
I'm trying to get my boys
off to college.

978
01:12:08,037 --> 01:12:11,040
It's worthwhile what
y'all are doing, but...

979
01:12:11,207 --> 01:12:13,793
...but my boys are worth more.

980
01:12:14,585 --> 01:12:15,628
I understand.

981
01:12:19,507 --> 01:12:22,969
What do you understand, Skeeter?

982
01:12:25,096 --> 01:12:29,726
Yule Mae was just saying how excited she
is that her boys are going to college.

983
01:12:30,561 --> 01:12:33,230
Did you also ask Miss Skeeter
if you could borrow money?

984
01:12:34,064 --> 01:12:35,399
Of course not.

985
01:12:37,568 --> 01:12:39,570
I'm gonna put Billy down for his nap.

986
01:12:41,530 --> 01:12:42,948
Excuse me.

987
01:12:45,993 --> 01:12:47,327
Come on, baby.

988
01:12:55,002 --> 01:12:59,756
Skeeter, are you intentionally not
putting my initiative in the newsletter?

989
01:12:59,881 --> 01:13:03,719
No, not at all. I just have been
really busy with Mama.

990
01:13:03,885 --> 01:13:05,721
I know.

991
01:13:05,887 --> 01:13:09,516
I know, you must be so worried
about your mother, but...

992
01:13:10,892 --> 01:13:12,436
I'm worried about you.

993
01:13:13,478 --> 01:13:15,063
Reading this stuff?

994
01:13:15,897 --> 01:13:19,860
Believe it or not, there are real
racists in this town.

995
01:13:20,610 --> 01:13:22,780
If the wrong person caught you
with anything like that,

996
01:13:22,905 --> 01:13:24,907
you'd be in serious trouble.

997
01:13:26,784 --> 01:13:28,494
I'll be on the lookout.

998
01:13:32,665 --> 01:13:34,667
Put my initiative in the newsletter.

999
01:13:38,338 --> 01:13:39,589
OK?

1000
01:14:29,056 --> 01:14:31,308
Skeeter, get up!

1001
01:14:31,433 --> 01:14:33,811
- No! What?
- We've got to get dressed.

1002
01:14:35,521 --> 01:14:36,647
What's wrong?

1003
01:14:36,814 --> 01:14:39,191
Don't panic. Don't panic.

1004
01:14:39,316 --> 01:14:44,196
There's a particularly tall and very
handsome man named Stuart here for you.

1005
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,157
Oh, God.

1006
01:14:47,282 --> 01:14:49,284
Oh, mother.

1007
01:14:49,451 --> 01:14:52,037
You would not like him. Trust me.

1008
01:14:52,162 --> 01:14:53,413
He's a drunken asshole.

1009
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:57,835
Love and hate are two horns on the same
goat, Eugenia, and you need a goat.

1010
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,087
Put that on. Hurry!

1011
01:15:06,885 --> 01:15:08,262
Look, I know it was a few weeks back,

1012
01:15:08,428 --> 01:15:12,392
but I came to say I'm sorry
for the way I acted.

1013
01:15:12,517 --> 01:15:14,519
Who sent you, William or Hilly?

1014
01:15:14,644 --> 01:15:15,770
Neither.

1015
01:15:15,937 --> 01:15:18,314
Hilly. But I wanted to come, OK.

1016
01:15:18,481 --> 01:15:20,608
I was rude, and I've been
thinking about it a lot.

1017
01:15:21,150 --> 01:15:24,153
- Well, I haven't. So you can just go.
- Goddamn it!

1018
01:15:26,030 --> 01:15:29,909
I told Hilly I wasn't ready to go out on
any date. Wasn't even close to ready.

1019
01:15:34,455 --> 01:15:36,958
I was engaged last year. She ended it.

1020
01:15:37,083 --> 01:15:38,459
I'm sure she did.

1021
01:15:38,585 --> 01:15:41,045
It's not like that.
I'm not always a jerk.

1022
01:15:43,506 --> 01:15:46,884
We had been dating since we were 15,
and you know how it is.

1023
01:15:47,010 --> 01:15:50,013
Actually, I don't. I've never really
dated anyone before.

1024
01:15:50,638 --> 01:15:51,639
Ever?

1025
01:15:52,724 --> 01:15:53,725
Ever.

1026
01:15:55,727 --> 01:15:58,104
All right, I, uh...

1027
01:16:00,023 --> 01:16:01,524
Well, that must be it, then.

1028
01:16:01,649 --> 01:16:03,027
- What?
- You, Skeeter.

1029
01:16:03,152 --> 01:16:05,571
I've never met a woman that says
exactly what she's thinking.

1030
01:16:05,738 --> 01:16:08,574
- Well, I got plenty to say.
- Yeah, I'll bet you do.

1031
01:16:10,409 --> 01:16:12,536
You make me laugh, smile.

1032
01:16:16,332 --> 01:16:18,083
Would you like to come
have dinner with me?

1033
01:16:19,627 --> 01:16:23,005
We could talk. I could actually
listen to you this time.

1034
01:16:23,922 --> 01:16:25,841
I can't think of anything worse.

1035
01:16:27,634 --> 01:16:29,428
I understand, and I'm sorry.

1036
01:16:29,595 --> 01:16:32,139
That's what
I came here to say, and I said it.

1037
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:40,606
Just give me a minute.

1038
01:16:41,523 --> 01:16:42,775
Let me get my sweater.

1039
01:16:48,947 --> 01:16:50,616
Not a big fan of oysters, huh?

1040
01:16:50,783 --> 01:16:53,535
Oysters are a vehicle
for crackers and ketchup.

1041
01:16:55,204 --> 01:16:57,582
Well, here's to new beginnings.

1042
01:17:03,296 --> 01:17:04,798
Mm.

1043
01:17:06,883 --> 01:17:08,009
You're disgusting.

1044
01:17:08,134 --> 01:17:09,761
You've already made that pretty clear.

1045
01:17:10,762 --> 01:17:13,431
And just so you know,
the boys caught me reading

1046
01:17:13,598 --> 01:17:15,600
your Miss Myrna column
on the rig the other day.

1047
01:17:15,725 --> 01:17:18,228
Really? You read them?

1048
01:17:18,394 --> 01:17:19,395
All of them.

1049
01:17:20,355 --> 01:17:21,731
Very informative, too.

1050
01:17:21,898 --> 01:17:24,692
I had no idea that ground egg shells
got grease out of clothes.

1051
01:17:24,859 --> 01:17:26,277
Well, I do my homework.

1052
01:17:32,367 --> 01:17:34,035
You're a good writer, Skeeter.

1053
01:17:35,537 --> 01:17:36,538
Thank you.

1054
01:17:39,249 --> 01:17:40,875
I want to be a journalist.

1055
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:45,088
Or maybe a novelist. Or maybe both.

1056
01:17:45,797 --> 01:17:47,215
I like that.

1057
01:17:49,551 --> 01:17:51,929
You're really smart. And pretty.

1058
01:18:00,771 --> 01:18:02,148
Skeeter.

1059
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,317
I hope you get to write something
really good.

1060
01:18:06,485 --> 01:18:07,862
Something you believe in.

1061
01:18:20,249 --> 01:18:21,250
Hello?

1062
01:18:23,502 --> 01:18:26,589
What? I'm coming!

1063
01:18:26,755 --> 01:18:30,134
Aibileen! Come on. We have to go
help Hilly. Right now!

1064
01:18:34,763 --> 01:18:38,267
Oh! You're trespassing!

1065
01:18:38,434 --> 01:18:40,352
It's Skeeter!

1066
01:18:40,519 --> 01:18:41,854
She put it in the newsletter.

1067
01:18:42,021 --> 01:18:43,230
Oh, my God.

1068
01:18:43,398 --> 01:18:48,028
I specifically said,
"Drop old coats at my house. "

1069
01:18:48,194 --> 01:18:50,238
Not commodes!

1070
01:18:50,405 --> 01:18:52,240
Why would she do this to me?

1071
01:18:52,407 --> 01:18:54,242
I don't know. I don't Know, Hilly.

1072
01:18:54,409 --> 01:18:57,078
It's so embarrassing.

1073
01:19:05,128 --> 01:19:06,838
Oh, Lord.

1074
01:19:07,005 --> 01:19:08,381
I go potty, Mommy.

1075
01:19:09,382 --> 01:19:11,426
No! Mae Mobley!

1076
01:19:11,593 --> 01:19:13,637
You get off of that toilet!

1077
01:19:15,305 --> 01:19:17,599
- You will catch diseases, you hear me?
- Mommy!

1078
01:19:17,766 --> 01:19:19,768
You will catch diseases
on those toilets.

1079
01:19:33,531 --> 01:19:37,620
You is kind, you is smart,

1080
01:19:37,787 --> 01:19:39,997
you is important.

1081
01:19:50,466 --> 01:19:53,427
Don't shop for anything
on Capitol Street.

1082
01:19:53,594 --> 01:19:58,474
Let's let the merchants down on
Capitol Street feel the economic pinch.

1083
01:19:58,641 --> 01:20:00,559
Let me say this to you.

1084
01:20:00,726 --> 01:20:03,437
I had one merchant to call me,
and he said,

1085
01:20:03,604 --> 01:20:08,234
"I want you to know that I've
talked to my national office today,

1086
01:20:08,401 --> 01:20:11,695
and they want me to tell you that we
don't need nigger business. "

1087
01:20:13,114 --> 01:20:16,867
These are stores that help to support
the White Citizens' Council,

1088
01:20:17,034 --> 01:20:21,247
the council that is dedicated to keeping
you and I second-class citizens.

1089
01:20:21,789 --> 01:20:23,249
Mama!

1090
01:20:26,085 --> 01:20:27,628
Don't encourage them like that.

1091
01:20:27,795 --> 01:20:30,172
- That is national news.
- I won't have it!

1092
01:20:33,093 --> 01:20:34,386
You understand?

1093
01:20:44,813 --> 01:20:46,148
How you doing, Miss Clark?

1094
01:20:47,774 --> 01:20:50,360
All right, Henry.

1095
01:20:50,527 --> 01:20:52,404
Thank you. How you doing?

1096
01:20:53,738 --> 01:20:57,492
If God is willing, Miss Clark.
If God is willing.

1097
01:20:57,659 --> 01:20:59,077
That's good.

1098
01:20:59,244 --> 01:21:00,829
- Yeah.
- That's good.

1099
01:21:09,546 --> 01:21:10,922
What's going on out there, mister?

1100
01:21:11,089 --> 01:21:13,049
Colored people off.

1101
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:14,801
The rest of you,
let me know where you're going.

1102
01:21:14,968 --> 01:21:16,094
I'll get you close as I can.

1103
01:21:16,261 --> 01:21:17,846
What happened?

1104
01:21:18,013 --> 01:21:19,806
I don't know. Some nigger got shot.

1105
01:21:20,807 --> 01:21:22,767
- Where you headed?
- Woodrow Wilson.

1106
01:21:22,934 --> 01:21:24,896
Woodrow Wilson. All right.

1107
01:21:34,030 --> 01:21:37,825
- You gonna be all right, Miss Clark?
- I'll be all right. You go on now.

1108
01:21:37,992 --> 01:21:40,244
- You want me to walk you?
- No, thank you. I'll be all right.

1109
01:21:41,579 --> 01:21:42,914
You have a good night.

1110
01:21:43,581 --> 01:21:45,291
Which way you going?

1111
01:21:53,299 --> 01:21:56,260
We View this as a cold,

1112
01:21:56,427 --> 01:21:58,387
brutal, deliberate...

1113
01:21:59,555 --> 01:22:03,809
...killing in a savage,
uncivilized state.

1114
01:22:03,976 --> 01:22:09,148
There is no state with a record that
approaches that of Mississippi

1115
01:22:09,315 --> 01:22:13,486
in inhumanity murder, brutality

1116
01:22:13,653 --> 01:22:15,696
and racial hatred.

1117
01:22:15,863 --> 01:22:19,534
It is absolutely at the bottom
of the list.

1118
01:22:21,036 --> 01:22:22,162
Fifteen minutes past midnight,

1119
01:22:22,329 --> 01:22:26,083
Evers got out of his car beside his home
in a Negro residential area.

1120
01:22:26,249 --> 01:22:28,168
In a vacant lot about 40 yards away

1121
01:22:28,335 --> 01:22:31,755
a sniper fired a single shot from a
high-powered rifle at Evers' silhouette.

1122
01:22:31,922 --> 01:22:34,257
I'm all right. Sit down. You all right?

1123
01:22:34,424 --> 01:22:36,009
- I'm OK.
- The bullet hit him in the back,

1124
01:22:36,176 --> 01:22:39,054
crashed through his body
through a window, into the house.

1125
01:22:39,221 --> 01:22:41,682
He died within an hour
at a Jackson hospital.

1126
01:22:41,848 --> 01:22:44,184
City detectives believe the fatal shot
was fired from...

1127
01:22:44,351 --> 01:22:48,355
KKK shot him. An hour ago.

1128
01:22:50,107 --> 01:22:52,067
Right in front of his children,
Aibileen.

1129
01:22:53,652 --> 01:22:56,697
We're gonna pray for the Evers.
We're gonna pray for Myrlie.

1130
01:22:56,863 --> 01:23:00,200
We living in hell. Trapped.

1131
01:23:01,159 --> 01:23:02,577
Our kids, trapped.

1132
01:23:06,039 --> 01:23:08,542
Sugar, take your brothers and sisters
and y'all go on to bed.

1133
01:23:14,006 --> 01:23:15,842
Good night.

1134
01:23:16,008 --> 01:23:18,344
Good night. Good night.

1135
01:23:20,721 --> 01:23:22,890
Oh. Good night, baby.

1136
01:23:34,485 --> 01:23:36,612
What they gonna do if they catch us
with Miss Skeeter?

1137
01:23:37,613 --> 01:23:38,990
We're gonna be careful.

1138
01:23:40,283 --> 01:23:44,996
Hitch us to a pickup? Drag us behind?
Shoot me in front of my children?

1139
01:23:45,163 --> 01:23:47,665
We ain't doing civil rights.

1140
01:23:47,832 --> 01:23:50,751
We're just telling stories
like they really happened.

1141
01:23:52,628 --> 01:23:54,964
You're a fool, old woman.

1142
01:23:56,174 --> 01:23:57,592
A fool.

1143
01:24:28,165 --> 01:24:33,128
Miss Phelan, the presses are heating up.
We needed Miss Myrna 30 minutes ago.

1144
01:24:33,754 --> 01:24:34,755
Yes, Sir.

1145
01:24:34,922 --> 01:24:36,465
Chop-chop.

1146
01:24:37,758 --> 01:24:39,134
Good Lord.

1147
01:24:55,067 --> 01:24:56,818
Miss Celia?

1148
01:25:14,587 --> 01:25:15,630
Miss Celia?

1149
01:25:15,797 --> 01:25:17,799
Go home.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1150
01:25:17,966 --> 01:25:20,218
You mess up your hair coloring again?

1151
01:25:20,385 --> 01:25:23,846
I helped you ix it last time.
We got it back to butter batch.

1152
01:25:24,013 --> 01:25:25,598
Was real pretty, remember?

1153
01:25:29,644 --> 01:25:30,979
Miss Celia.

1154
01:25:32,105 --> 01:25:33,940
I told you, go home!

1155
01:25:49,914 --> 01:25:51,457
I said get out!

1156
01:26:07,349 --> 01:26:09,893
Why is there so much blood?

1157
01:26:15,482 --> 01:26:19,403
Next one's gonna catch, Miss Celia.
You just wait and see.

1158
01:26:21,739 --> 01:26:24,408
We got married 'cause I was pregnant.

1159
01:26:26,827 --> 01:26:29,163
Then I lost it a month later.

1160
01:26:31,707 --> 01:26:33,667
Johnny wants kids now.

1161
01:26:37,212 --> 01:26:38,964
What's he gonna do with me?

1162
01:26:42,009 --> 01:26:43,260
Well...

1163
01:26:44,678 --> 01:26:46,681
Mr. Johnny just gonna have
to get over it.

1164
01:26:49,225 --> 01:26:51,269
He doesn't know about the baby.

1165
01:26:55,482 --> 01:26:57,358
Or the two before.

1166
01:27:52,248 --> 01:27:53,582
Yule Mae Davis?

1167
01:27:56,502 --> 01:27:58,796
- What do you want me to do?
- You're under arrest.

1168
01:28:00,005 --> 01:28:03,342
Just call my husband.
Just call my husband.

1169
01:28:07,054 --> 01:28:10,349
- Wait a minute. I want my purse.
- No, you're under arrest.

1170
01:28:10,516 --> 01:28:14,311
I want to get my purse.
I want to get my purse! Aibee!

1171
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:17,272
- Don't fight, Yule Mae!
- Aibee!

1172
01:28:17,439 --> 01:28:21,527
Aibee, I want my purse! I want my purse!

1173
01:28:25,447 --> 01:28:27,366
Just let me go!

1174
01:28:28,158 --> 01:28:30,411
Yule Mae, don't fight.

1175
01:28:38,962 --> 01:28:42,090
I knew she was a thief
the day she started.

1176
01:28:42,924 --> 01:28:47,095
A nigra walks into a pawn shop
with a ring of such size and color.

1177
01:28:48,430 --> 01:28:51,516
It took them all of ten minutes
to find out where she worked.

1178
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:55,854
I am desperate for
a grilled cheese sandwich.

1179
01:28:56,021 --> 01:28:58,440
Are you? Are you?
Do you want a grilled cheese sandwich?

1180
01:28:58,606 --> 01:29:00,275
Oh, yes.

1181
01:29:00,442 --> 01:29:02,193
Just go sit down over there.

1182
01:29:08,867 --> 01:29:13,246
Miss Skeeter, you best head on over
to Miss Aibileen's house.

1183
01:29:14,038 --> 01:29:15,039
Now.

1184
01:29:45,529 --> 01:29:47,698
I'm gonna help with your stories.

1185
01:29:49,074 --> 01:29:51,410
I'm gonna help, too. Mm-hm.

1186
01:29:53,287 --> 01:29:54,455
We all are.

1187
01:29:54,622 --> 01:29:57,583
- That's right.
- I'll help you.

1188
01:29:58,959 --> 01:30:01,420
I used to take
a shortcut every day

1189
01:30:01,587 --> 01:30:04,298
when I went to work
at Dr. Dixon's house.

1190
01:30:04,965 --> 01:30:08,010
Cut through that farmer's lower 40
to get there.

1191
01:30:08,177 --> 01:30:12,014
One day this farmer
was waiting for me with a gun.

1192
01:30:12,181 --> 01:30:15,768
Said he'd shoot me dead
if I walked on his land again.

1193
01:30:16,477 --> 01:30:22,192
Dr. Dixon went and paid that farmer
double for two of those acres.

1194
01:30:22,734 --> 01:30:25,570
Told him he was gonna
start farming, too.

1195
01:30:26,530 --> 01:30:31,201
But he bought that just for me,
so I could get to work easy.

1196
01:30:32,494 --> 01:30:33,703
He did.

1197
01:30:33,870 --> 01:30:36,915
I worked for Miss Jolene's mother
till the day she died.

1198
01:30:37,791 --> 01:30:41,294
Then her daughter, Miss Nancy,
asked me to come and work for her.

1199
01:30:42,379 --> 01:30:44,673
Miss Nancy is a real sweet lady.

1200
01:30:45,674 --> 01:30:50,053
But Miss Jolene's ma done put it in her
will I got to work for Miss Jolene.

1201
01:30:51,096 --> 01:30:53,932
Miss Jolene's a mean woman.

1202
01:30:54,099 --> 01:30:55,642
Mean for sport.

1203
01:30:57,978 --> 01:31:00,647
Lord, I tried to find another job.

1204
01:31:01,731 --> 01:31:03,858
But in everybody's mind

1205
01:31:04,025 --> 01:31:07,404
the French family
and Miss Jolene owned me.

1206
01:31:09,572 --> 01:31:10,907
Owned me.

1207
01:31:16,664 --> 01:31:18,457
I leave early
this week for Thanksgiving.

1208
01:31:18,624 --> 01:31:21,419
Our last editors' meeting
is December 17th,

1209
01:31:21,585 --> 01:31:23,337
so if you want a prayer
of this getting read,

1210
01:31:23,504 --> 01:31:26,507
- I'd better have it by then.
- That's in three weeks, Miss Stein.

1211
01:31:26,674 --> 01:31:29,176
Well, otherwise it goes in the pile.

1212
01:31:29,343 --> 01:31:32,138
You do not want it in the pile.

1213
01:31:32,305 --> 01:31:33,389
Yes, ma'am.

1214
01:31:33,556 --> 01:31:36,892
And put something personal in there.
Write about the maid who raised you.

1215
01:31:38,269 --> 01:31:39,603
I understand.

1216
01:31:47,278 --> 01:31:50,072
Well, we have a lot of work to do
before the benefit, don't we?

1217
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:53,242
I know, but I think We're on track.
We're doing quite well.

1218
01:32:01,584 --> 01:32:03,085
- it's so good.
- Mm-hm.

1219
01:32:03,252 --> 01:32:05,087
- Who's there?
- I don't know.

1220
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:06,881
Aibileen?

1221
01:32:09,384 --> 01:32:10,969
Hey, Elizabeth!

1222
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:13,472
It's me, Celia Foote.

1223
01:32:15,599 --> 01:32:19,061
I was in the neighborhood.
Thought I'd drop by.

1224
01:32:20,729 --> 01:32:23,440
Everybody hide.
Everybody get down, get down.

1225
01:32:24,357 --> 01:32:26,610
Get down! Get down! Get down!

1226
01:32:29,821 --> 01:32:31,740
- Turn off the music.
- Who are we hiding from?

1227
01:32:31,907 --> 01:32:33,742
Shh!

1228
01:32:37,078 --> 01:32:39,831
Hey!

1229
01:32:39,998 --> 01:32:41,041
Shh!

1230
01:32:44,961 --> 01:32:46,296
I brought a chocolate pie!

1231
01:32:48,632 --> 01:32:50,884
My maid, Minny, made it.

1232
01:32:58,225 --> 01:33:00,477
She's in the bushes.

1233
01:33:22,291 --> 01:33:27,046
Don't be taking those women
any more pies, you understand?

1234
01:33:35,346 --> 01:33:38,766
They made me stand there like I was
the vacuum salesman.

1235
01:33:40,851 --> 01:33:42,019
Why, Minny?

1236
01:33:44,146 --> 01:33:48,025
Because they know about you getting
knocked up by Mr. Johnny.

1237
01:33:48,192 --> 01:33:50,111
Mad you married one of their mens.

1238
01:33:50,945 --> 01:33:54,865
And especially since Miss Hilly and
Mr. Johnny had just broke up, too.

1239
01:33:55,032 --> 01:33:57,578
Hilly probably thinks that I was
fooling around with Johnny

1240
01:33:57,744 --> 01:33:59,413
when they were still going steady.

1241
01:33:59,580 --> 01:34:01,665
Mm-hm.

1242
01:34:01,832 --> 01:34:06,086
And Missus Walters always said Miss
Hilly still sweet on Mr. Johnny, too.

1243
01:34:07,963 --> 01:34:09,464
No wonder!

1244
01:34:12,467 --> 01:34:16,638
They don't hate me.
They hate what they think I did.

1245
01:34:17,514 --> 01:34:20,183
They hate you 'cause they think
you white trash.

1246
01:34:20,350 --> 01:34:23,270
I'm just going to have to tell Hilly
I ain't no boyfriend stealer.

1247
01:34:24,896 --> 01:34:27,691
In fact, I'll tell her Friday night
at the benefit.

1248
01:34:28,817 --> 01:34:31,111
You don't need to be going
to that benefit, Miss Celia.

1249
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:35,866
Did you hear me? You just stay home.

1250
01:34:39,995 --> 01:34:41,163
That looks bad.

1251
01:34:43,540 --> 01:34:44,875
Let me take a look.

1252
01:34:45,751 --> 01:34:47,419
I got to get these peas on.

1253
01:34:47,586 --> 01:34:50,340
I know you didn't fall
in no tub, Minny.

1254
01:35:11,611 --> 01:35:14,155
You know what I'd do if I were you?

1255
01:35:15,907 --> 01:35:17,992
I'd give it right back to him.

1256
01:35:19,535 --> 01:35:22,413
I'd hit him over the head
with a skillet,

1257
01:35:22,580 --> 01:35:25,333
and I'd tell him, "Go straight to hell. "

1258
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:38,096
From here, the members of the family...

1259
01:35:41,474 --> 01:35:44,812
...visitors from foreign countries
and others

1260
01:35:44,978 --> 01:35:47,981
will walk to St. Matthew's Cathedral.

1261
01:35:54,530 --> 01:35:57,324
Senator Edward Kennedy
getting out of the car.

1262
01:35:59,368 --> 01:36:00,702
Mrs. Kennedy.

1263
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:04,122
Robert Kennedy, Attorney General.

1264
01:36:04,289 --> 01:36:06,375
Sweetheart, I gotta
get down to the coast.

1265
01:36:07,668 --> 01:36:09,294
I'll be back in time for the benefit.

1266
01:36:21,598 --> 01:36:24,017
The world done gone crazy,
Miss Skeeter, and I'm scared.

1267
01:36:24,768 --> 01:36:28,021
What if people ind out what we writing,
figure out Niceville really Jackson,

1268
01:36:28,188 --> 01:36:29,523
figure out who who?

1269
01:36:32,734 --> 01:36:34,653
Maybe we need us some insurance.

1270
01:36:37,156 --> 01:36:40,618
I told God I'd never speak of it again.

1271
01:36:41,828 --> 01:36:43,621
But we ain't got no choice.

1272
01:36:45,123 --> 01:36:46,124
Sorry.

1273
01:36:47,250 --> 01:36:51,129
I need to tell y'all about the terrible
awful I done to Miss Hilly.

1274
01:36:52,630 --> 01:36:54,757
It might be the only thing
that keep us safe.

1275
01:36:59,679 --> 01:37:01,222
Mmm.

1276
01:37:01,389 --> 01:37:03,349
Mm-mm-mm.

1277
01:37:06,728 --> 01:37:07,979
So...

1278
01:37:09,814 --> 01:37:12,650
Nobody wanted to hire a sass-mouthing,
thieving nigra.

1279
01:37:15,528 --> 01:37:16,696
Did they?

1280
01:37:24,078 --> 01:37:26,664
Oh. Pie's as good as always, Minny.

1281
01:37:26,831 --> 01:37:28,082
I'm glad you like it.

1282
01:37:28,249 --> 01:37:29,625
Mmm.

1283
01:37:31,253 --> 01:37:33,297
Oh.

1284
01:37:33,464 --> 01:37:38,385
If I take you back, I'll have to cut
your pay five dollars a week.

1285
01:37:38,552 --> 01:37:40,012
Take me back?

1286
01:37:42,514 --> 01:37:46,268
What do you put in here
that makes it taste so good?

1287
01:37:46,435 --> 01:37:49,188
That good vanilla from Mexico...

1288
01:37:49,355 --> 01:37:51,982
...and something else real special.

1289
01:37:53,525 --> 01:37:54,777
Mmm.

1290
01:37:54,943 --> 01:37:59,114
No, no, no, Missus Walters.
That's Miss Hilly's special pie.

1291
01:38:02,117 --> 01:38:03,535
Mama can have a piece.

1292
01:38:05,537 --> 01:38:07,581
Cut her one.

1293
01:38:09,375 --> 01:38:10,709
Go get a plate.

1294
01:38:15,672 --> 01:38:16,882
Eat my shit.

1295
01:38:21,136 --> 01:38:22,513
What'd you say?

1296
01:38:23,097 --> 01:38:26,726
I said, "Eat... my... shit. "

1297
01:38:36,069 --> 01:38:37,654
Have you lost your mind?

1298
01:38:39,322 --> 01:38:44,619
No, ma'am, but you about to,
'cause you just did.

1299
01:38:45,328 --> 01:38:47,956
Did what?

1300
01:39:09,018 --> 01:39:11,062
And you didn't eat just one.

1301
01:39:11,229 --> 01:39:13,398
You had two slices!

1302
01:39:23,492 --> 01:39:26,245
Run, Minny, run!

1303
01:39:30,833 --> 01:39:32,418
You trying to get yourself killed?

1304
01:39:32,585 --> 01:39:35,504
No! I wasn't planning on telling.

1305
01:39:37,464 --> 01:39:39,300
I just wanted to see her take a bite.

1306
01:39:40,593 --> 01:39:44,471
Then I was gonna leave.
Be done with her forever.

1307
01:39:45,681 --> 01:39:48,392
Before I knew it, I had done
told that woman what was in that pie!

1308
01:39:51,395 --> 01:39:53,272
I done ask God to forgive me.

1309
01:39:55,274 --> 01:39:58,152
But more for what happened
to poor Miss Walters.

1310
01:40:00,195 --> 01:40:04,950
Miss Hilly threw her in that
nursing home... just for laughing.

1311
01:40:06,535 --> 01:40:08,245
We can't put that story in the book.

1312
01:40:09,121 --> 01:40:10,497
We ain't got no choice.

1313
01:40:11,207 --> 01:40:14,711
Hilly Holbrook can't let nobody know
that pie story about her.

1314
01:40:14,878 --> 01:40:17,005
Exactly. If people find out
the terrible awful

1315
01:40:17,172 --> 01:40:19,424
was you and Miss Hilly
we in trouble there ain't words for.

1316
01:40:19,549 --> 01:40:21,676
Right! But don't you see?

1317
01:40:21,801 --> 01:40:25,138
She gonna go to her grave convincing
folks this book ain't about Jackson.

1318
01:40:25,263 --> 01:40:28,058
Now, that keeps us safe. Insured.

1319
01:40:29,392 --> 01:40:30,769
No.

1320
01:40:31,811 --> 01:40:33,146
No, that's too dangerous.

1321
01:40:37,525 --> 01:40:40,945
Y'all two brought me into this,
but I'm gonna finish it.

1322
01:40:41,821 --> 01:40:45,158
Either put it in, or pull my parts
out altogether. Y'all pick!

1323
01:40:56,544 --> 01:40:59,547
Thank you, Tommy. I should be out
by 10:00. See you then.

1324
01:41:05,137 --> 01:41:08,849
This is Jolene French, reporting from
the African Children's Benefit Ball,

1325
01:41:08,974 --> 01:41:12,353
and I'm here with League President,
Miss Hilly Holbrook.

1326
01:41:12,478 --> 01:41:17,024
Thanks, Jolene. And I'm just so excited
for the auction tonight, aren't you?

1327
01:41:17,149 --> 01:41:19,151
I'm absolutely thrilled.

1328
01:41:19,985 --> 01:41:21,612
Scandalous!

1329
01:41:24,198 --> 01:41:25,199
Thank you.

1330
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:36,836
Hi!

1331
01:41:43,801 --> 01:41:45,511
Did you see what Miss Celia got on?

1332
01:41:45,636 --> 01:41:48,848
Lord, have mercy. Women better hold onto
their husbands tonight.

1333
01:41:50,266 --> 01:41:52,518
Miss Leefolt been working on that dress
for four weeks

1334
01:41:52,643 --> 01:41:53,769
and that's what she came up with?

1335
01:41:53,936 --> 01:41:56,647
Here.

1336
01:42:08,535 --> 01:42:09,744
Kiss me.

1337
01:42:43,695 --> 01:42:45,697
Everybody enjoying the evening?

1338
01:42:50,493 --> 01:42:53,497
Let's give a nice round of applause
for the help.

1339
01:42:57,251 --> 01:43:00,504
For all the men and women who have
helped make tonight possible.

1340
01:43:02,256 --> 01:43:05,134
A cause I'm sure is dear
to their hearts as well.

1341
01:43:07,553 --> 01:43:09,680
- Your cocktail.
- Thank you.

1342
01:43:11,307 --> 01:43:15,519
Honey, don't you think
you've had enough to drink?

1343
01:43:15,645 --> 01:43:17,396
I wish you'd try and eat something.

1344
01:43:17,521 --> 01:43:19,774
I'm not having my stomach poke out.

1345
01:43:23,653 --> 01:43:27,531
OK, OK, everybody, quiet down.
I got the list of the winners!

1346
01:43:29,659 --> 01:43:30,910
OK.

1347
01:43:31,077 --> 01:43:35,831
The winner of the beautiful
mink car coat is...

1348
01:43:36,499 --> 01:43:37,750
...Charlotte Phelan!

1349
01:43:39,585 --> 01:43:41,337
Congrats, Miss Phelan.

1350
01:43:41,504 --> 01:43:43,673
Ladies, I hope
your husbands take note of that.

1351
01:43:45,217 --> 01:43:48,637
Now it's time for the baked goods.

1352
01:43:49,846 --> 01:43:51,765
Ooh, yummy, yummy!

1353
01:43:51,932 --> 01:43:55,185
The highest bid
in baked goods goes to

1354
01:43:55,310 --> 01:43:58,188
Minny Jackson's chocolate pie.

1355
01:43:59,940 --> 01:44:01,441
Congratulations...

1356
01:44:02,109 --> 01:44:03,860
...Hilly Holbrook!

1357
01:44:04,194 --> 01:44:08,365
- Oh! Hilly.
- That's funny.

1358
01:44:08,532 --> 01:44:10,200
I didn't bid on anything.

1359
01:44:10,367 --> 01:44:13,912
All right. And now it's time
for Danica's strawberry jam.

1360
01:44:14,079 --> 01:44:15,330
Shh!

1361
01:44:18,041 --> 01:44:19,918
Congratulations, Hilly!

1362
01:44:20,085 --> 01:44:23,213
I didn't know you were a fan
of Minny's pies.

1363
01:44:24,798 --> 01:44:27,300
I've been wanting to talk to you
all night.

1364
01:44:27,426 --> 01:44:29,428
Minny said why you won't be my friend.

1365
01:44:29,553 --> 01:44:31,805
It's 'cause you think me and Johnny
went behind your back.

1366
01:44:33,473 --> 01:44:35,392
Wait. I want to talk...

1367
01:44:35,559 --> 01:44:36,935
Oh, no.

1368
01:44:37,102 --> 01:44:38,771
I'm so sorry.

1369
01:44:41,983 --> 01:44:43,734
Come here, sweetheart.

1370
01:44:43,901 --> 01:44:45,653
Let me bring you back to your table.

1371
01:44:48,114 --> 01:44:50,616
- I'm really sorry.
- It's all right. Don't worry about it.

1372
01:44:51,868 --> 01:44:55,496
What are you trying to do to me?
What are you and that nigra up to?

1373
01:44:55,621 --> 01:44:57,290
I don't know what you're talking about.

1374
01:44:57,457 --> 01:44:59,000
You liar! Who did you tell?

1375
01:44:59,167 --> 01:45:01,461
Hilly, I got pregnant
after you and Johnny broke up!

1376
01:45:01,627 --> 01:45:04,297
- Oh, shit!
- Shut up, Mother!

1377
01:45:04,463 --> 01:45:07,884
Johnny never cheated on you.

1378
01:45:08,801 --> 01:45:10,303
At least not with me.

1379
01:45:10,469 --> 01:45:13,848
Oh, Johnny would never cheat on me.

1380
01:45:14,015 --> 01:45:17,393
I'm so sorry! I thought you'd be tickled
you won that pie!

1381
01:45:18,269 --> 01:45:22,648
You tell that nigra, if she tells
anybody, I will make her suffer!

1382
01:45:22,815 --> 01:45:25,109
Hey, that is enough.

1383
01:45:25,693 --> 01:45:26,694
Celia.

1384
01:45:26,861 --> 01:45:28,362
Hey, baby, what's the matter?

1385
01:45:28,529 --> 01:45:31,157
- Oh!
- Cel?

1386
01:45:32,158 --> 01:45:33,160
Oh!

1387
01:45:34,786 --> 01:45:38,081
Oh, shit. What a mess. Napkins.

1388
01:45:39,583 --> 01:45:42,252
Why don't we get back to the auction?

1389
01:45:42,419 --> 01:45:45,339
- Next up, Debby's peppermint bark.
- Celia!

1390
01:45:45,923 --> 01:45:47,966
It goes great with hot cocoa.

1391
01:45:53,847 --> 01:45:56,058
Oh, just come on home with us
tonight, Mother.

1392
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:59,478
No, thanks. I've got a pie to eat.

1393
01:45:59,645 --> 01:46:02,064
You throw that pie away right now.

1394
01:46:02,230 --> 01:46:04,358
I spent good money on this pie.

1395
01:46:05,275 --> 01:46:07,069
I won it just for you.

1396
01:46:07,235 --> 01:46:09,363
You signed me up?

1397
01:46:09,529 --> 01:46:13,575
I may have trouble remembering my own
name, or what country I live in,

1398
01:46:13,742 --> 01:46:16,161
but there are two things
I can't seem to forget:

1399
01:46:16,328 --> 01:46:19,873
that my own daughter
threw me into a nursing home,

1400
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:22,042
and that she ate Minny's shit.

1401
01:46:23,126 --> 01:46:24,294
Good night.

1402
01:46:28,508 --> 01:46:31,970
- Hey, how about a nightcap?
- Let's go.

1403
01:46:39,102 --> 01:46:42,271
I'm not right for this
kind of life, Minny.

1404
01:46:44,148 --> 01:46:47,318
I don't need a dining room table
for 12 people.

1405
01:46:48,152 --> 01:46:51,531
I couldn't get two people
over here if I begged.

1406
01:46:55,827 --> 01:46:58,162
I can't do this to Johnny any more.

1407
01:47:00,581 --> 01:47:02,875
That's why I've gotta go back
to Sugar Ditch.

1408
01:47:04,585 --> 01:47:06,796
You can't move back to Sugar Ditch.

1409
01:47:09,048 --> 01:47:11,092
Lord.

1410
01:47:11,759 --> 01:47:14,053
I reckon it's time you knew.

1411
01:47:14,220 --> 01:47:15,388
Sit down.

1412
01:47:26,108 --> 01:47:29,153
So Miss Hilly thought you knew about
the terrible awful.

1413
01:47:30,446 --> 01:47:32,448
That you was making fun of her.

1414
01:47:35,451 --> 01:47:37,995
It's my fault she pounced on you.

1415
01:47:40,497 --> 01:47:42,499
If you leave Mr. Johnny...

1416
01:47:44,835 --> 01:47:47,921
...then Miss Hilly done won
the whole ball game.

1417
01:47:50,090 --> 01:47:51,925
Then she done beaten me...

1418
01:47:53,343 --> 01:47:55,429
...and she done beat you.

1419
01:48:02,478 --> 01:48:05,022
Thank you for telling me that.

1420
01:48:12,529 --> 01:48:16,159
Lord, look at all these pages. 266.

1421
01:48:16,618 --> 01:48:18,495
Mm-mm!

1422
01:48:19,746 --> 01:48:22,624
So we just send it off?
Just wait and see?

1423
01:48:22,790 --> 01:48:24,501
Hope Miss Stein gonna publish it?

1424
01:48:24,667 --> 01:48:28,796
Well, I have one more story to type
before I put it in the mail,

1425
01:48:28,963 --> 01:48:30,465
but other than that, we're done.

1426
01:48:30,632 --> 01:48:32,217
Which one you got left?

1427
01:48:34,719 --> 01:48:35,887
Uh, mine.

1428
01:48:46,522 --> 01:48:48,983
I need to talk to you about Constantine.

1429
01:48:49,484 --> 01:48:53,488
Oh, Eugenia, that was so long ago.

1430
01:48:54,030 --> 01:48:55,198
What happened?

1431
01:48:55,365 --> 01:48:57,742
Oh.

1432
01:48:58,534 --> 01:49:00,370
What happened?

1433
01:49:05,124 --> 01:49:07,253
She didn't give me a choice.

1434
01:49:12,383 --> 01:49:17,304
The Daughters of America had just
appointed me state regent.

1435
01:49:20,099 --> 01:49:23,435
Grace Higginbotham, our esteemed
president, came all the way down

1436
01:49:23,602 --> 01:49:27,564
from Washington, D.C.,
to our house for the ceremony.

1437
01:49:29,191 --> 01:49:33,195
That's just beautiful. Look at that.

1438
01:49:36,699 --> 01:49:40,411
She'd gotten so old and slow, Skeeter.

1439
01:49:44,123 --> 01:49:45,332
Yes, ma'am.

1440
01:49:48,002 --> 01:49:51,422
It's such an honor
that you came all this way.

1441
01:50:00,139 --> 01:50:01,182
That's all right.

1442
01:50:06,021 --> 01:50:08,690
- Hello, Miss Charlotte.
- Rachel.

1443
01:50:10,734 --> 01:50:12,861
We were expecting you next week.

1444
01:50:13,027 --> 01:50:14,821
I decided to come early
and surprise Mama.

1445
01:50:14,988 --> 01:50:16,906
Oh.

1446
01:50:17,949 --> 01:50:19,325
I'm entertaining.

1447
01:50:19,492 --> 01:50:21,870
Why don't you go around back.
Wait in the kitchen.

1448
01:50:27,542 --> 01:50:28,835
Go on now.

1449
01:50:32,005 --> 01:50:33,506
I am sorry.

1450
01:50:36,468 --> 01:50:39,095
Rachel, what are you doing?

1451
01:50:39,262 --> 01:50:42,515
I'm just doing as I was told,
Miss Charlotte.

1452
01:50:42,682 --> 01:50:44,184
Going to the kitchen.

1453
01:50:44,350 --> 01:50:46,436
But I'm going to see my mama first.

1454
01:50:47,896 --> 01:50:50,648
Hello, Mama.

1455
01:50:50,815 --> 01:50:53,526
Go on to the kitchen, baby.
I'll be there directly.

1456
01:50:53,693 --> 01:50:57,865
You may put up with this kind
of nonsense, but I do not.

1457
01:51:04,580 --> 01:51:06,123
Get out of this house, Rachel.

1458
01:51:10,252 --> 01:51:12,630
You heard her. Go on, girl.

1459
01:51:12,796 --> 01:51:16,926
Miss Charlotte, let me take her to
the kitchen. Come on, baby. Let's go.

1460
01:51:18,802 --> 01:51:20,221
Charlotte.

1461
01:51:24,642 --> 01:51:26,560
Both of you.

1462
01:51:26,727 --> 01:51:29,355
Leave. Now.

1463
01:51:33,526 --> 01:51:34,860
Come on, Mama.

1464
01:52:07,394 --> 01:52:08,937
Come on now.

1465
01:52:22,575 --> 01:52:25,078
Constantine didn't do anything wrong.

1466
01:52:26,788 --> 01:52:28,707
And you love Rachel. I know you do.

1467
01:52:28,873 --> 01:52:32,043
She was our president.
What was I supposed to do?

1468
01:52:33,044 --> 01:52:37,382
She did you the biggest favor of
your life. She taught me everything.

1469
01:52:37,549 --> 01:52:40,719
Well, you idolized her too much.
You always have.

1470
01:52:40,885 --> 01:52:43,014
I needed someone to look up to.

1471
01:52:46,434 --> 01:52:47,810
Well, I...

1472
01:52:48,644 --> 01:52:52,314
I went to her house the next day,
but she had already gone.

1473
01:53:23,054 --> 01:53:24,597
How could you not tell me all this?

1474
01:53:24,764 --> 01:53:28,267
Because I didn't want to upset you
during your final exams.

1475
01:53:28,434 --> 01:53:31,145
I knew you'd blame me,
and it wasn't my fault!

1476
01:53:31,312 --> 01:53:32,897
I have to go find her. She needs me.

1477
01:53:33,063 --> 01:53:34,356
- Eugenia.
- What?

1478
01:53:36,276 --> 01:53:39,738
We sent your brother up to Chicago
to bring Constantine home.

1479
01:53:48,663 --> 01:53:50,081
When he got there...

1480
01:53:54,169 --> 01:53:55,712
...she had died.

1481
01:54:11,853 --> 01:54:13,939
You broke her heart.

1482
01:54:19,528 --> 01:54:24,449
I'm...
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

1483
01:54:27,536 --> 01:54:29,163
I'm sorry.

1484
01:55:24,970 --> 01:55:26,930
They printed a few thousand copies

1485
01:55:27,097 --> 01:55:30,434
with the worst advance Miss Stein
had ever seen.

1486
01:55:30,600 --> 01:55:33,228
Baby, what you doing with Alicia book?
You can't read.

1487
01:55:34,313 --> 01:55:39,651
They sent Miss Skeeter $600. She broke
that money up and gave it to each of us.

1488
01:55:40,485 --> 01:55:45,407
Divided 13 ways,
that came to about $46 each.

1489
01:55:51,496 --> 01:55:52,831
Y'all finish your homework.

1490
01:55:58,003 --> 01:56:00,589
Aibileen. Aibileen!

1491
01:56:01,423 --> 01:56:04,092
We just got this from Miss Skeeter.
Look at it.

1492
01:56:04,259 --> 01:56:05,802
Look at it.

1493
01:56:05,969 --> 01:56:07,679
Look at it!

1494
01:56:07,846 --> 01:56:09,806
Minny, we're rich!

1495
01:56:11,725 --> 01:56:15,187
"She fired me
for using her inside toilet.

1496
01:56:15,353 --> 01:56:20,109
Put me out in a storm and told me never
to come back. But I did come back.

1497
01:56:20,276 --> 01:56:24,447
I came back with a pie I had baked
to say I'm sorry.

1498
01:56:25,490 --> 01:56:26,824
I watched her eat... "

1499
01:56:37,210 --> 01:56:39,378
Well, it's a wonderful book, Hilly.

1500
01:56:39,545 --> 01:56:43,466
Filled with gripping testimonials
from Mississippi's housekeepers.

1501
01:56:44,300 --> 01:56:46,135
OK, Mama. I need to run.

1502
01:56:46,302 --> 01:56:51,099
Well. You should read the book, Hilly.
It's quite scandalous.

1503
01:56:51,265 --> 01:56:54,852
Sounds like... Jackson, if you ask me.

1504
01:56:55,353 --> 01:56:56,687
Quite scandalous.

1505
01:56:58,022 --> 01:56:59,273
What book?

1506
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:00,650
What's it called again?

1507
01:57:00,900 --> 01:57:01,901
Uh...

1508
01:57:02,235 --> 01:57:04,946
The Help. H-E-L-P.

1509
01:57:32,724 --> 01:57:34,059
There it is.

1510
01:57:42,401 --> 01:57:43,860
You told me to write something good.

1511
01:57:44,027 --> 01:57:46,196
- Something I believed in.
- It's not what I believe in.

1512
01:57:46,363 --> 01:57:49,199
That joke you pulled with Hilly
with the toilets, that's funny.

1513
01:57:50,742 --> 01:57:52,703
Why would you do this to us?

1514
01:57:53,704 --> 01:57:55,289
I don't even know why you care.

1515
01:57:55,455 --> 01:57:58,292
- What?
- Things are fine around here.

1516
01:57:58,458 --> 01:57:59,876
Why go stir up trouble?

1517
01:58:00,043 --> 01:58:02,421
Trouble's already here, Stuart.

1518
01:58:02,588 --> 01:58:04,549
I had to tell you this.
You needed to know.

1519
01:58:04,716 --> 01:58:07,594
Goddamn right I needed to know. You
should have told me this from the start.

1520
01:58:12,390 --> 01:58:14,017
You're a selfish woman, Skeeter.

1521
01:58:15,893 --> 01:58:16,936
Stuart.

1522
01:58:17,103 --> 01:58:19,230
I think you're better off being alone.

1523
01:59:07,404 --> 01:59:08,947
Yeah.

1524
01:59:09,114 --> 01:59:11,867
Did you get to that part yet
that I was telling you about?

1525
01:59:12,034 --> 01:59:13,911
Don't read ahead, whatever you do.

1526
01:59:14,078 --> 01:59:16,372
"What you done put up in this?"

1527
01:59:16,538 --> 01:59:19,917
"She Said, 'My Shit. "'

1528
01:59:34,807 --> 01:59:36,350
What's the matter, Hilly?

1529
01:59:37,851 --> 01:59:41,605
- Get off of me! Get off!
- Ouch! Stop hitting me!

1530
01:59:43,732 --> 01:59:46,360
I heard that Betty character
might be Mary Elizabeth.

1531
01:59:46,527 --> 01:59:48,904
It's not Jackson.

1532
01:59:49,071 --> 01:59:53,451
And that book is garbage. I bet the
whole thing is made up by some nigra.

1533
01:59:53,618 --> 01:59:55,537
And Jolene, didn't your mama

1534
01:59:55,703 --> 01:59:57,705
leave Cora to you in her will?

1535
01:59:57,872 --> 02:00:01,793
Yes, but that's not odd, is it?
Happens all the time, right?

1536
02:00:01,960 --> 02:00:04,671
The book is not about Jackson.

1537
02:01:29,590 --> 02:01:31,091
What the hell?

1538
02:01:32,426 --> 02:01:33,927
What are you doing here?

1539
02:01:35,804 --> 02:01:38,058
I've contacted my lawyer.

1540
02:01:38,224 --> 02:01:40,852
Hibbie Goodman? He's the best
libel attorney in the state.

1541
02:01:41,019 --> 02:01:42,646
Oh, Missy, you're going to jail.

1542
02:01:42,812 --> 02:01:44,564
You can't prove anything.

1543
02:01:44,731 --> 02:01:48,068
Oh, I 100 percent know you wrote it.
Nobody else in town is as tacky as you.

1544
02:01:48,234 --> 02:01:50,111
You don't know anything, Hilly.

1545
02:01:50,278 --> 02:01:51,780
Oh, I don't, do I?

1546
02:01:52,447 --> 02:01:55,492
You tell Aibileen the next time
she wants to write

1547
02:01:55,659 --> 02:01:58,536
about my dear friend Elizabeth...

1548
02:01:58,703 --> 02:02:02,624
Uh-huh.
Remember her? Had you in her wedding.

1549
02:02:02,791 --> 02:02:06,002
Let's just say Aibileen ought to have
been a little bit smarter

1550
02:02:06,169 --> 02:02:08,838
before putting in about that
L- shaped scratch

1551
02:02:09,005 --> 02:02:11,674
in poor Elizabeth's dining table.

1552
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:17,555
And that nigger Minny,
do I have plans for her.

1553
02:02:18,223 --> 02:02:23,019
Careful, Hilly. That's chapter 12.

1554
02:02:23,186 --> 02:02:25,355
Don't give yourself away now.

1555
02:02:25,814 --> 02:02:27,440
That was not me!

1556
02:02:28,358 --> 02:02:30,527
I've come to tell your mother
what a hippie you've become.

1557
02:02:30,693 --> 02:02:32,738
She's going to be disgusted by you.

1558
02:02:32,905 --> 02:02:36,534
Why, Hilly. Is everything OK, you two?

1559
02:02:36,700 --> 02:02:37,701
Oh, Mrs. Phelan.

1560
02:02:37,868 --> 02:02:41,747
Hilly, you're a sweaty mess.
Are you ill?

1561
02:02:42,623 --> 02:02:43,624
No, ma'am.

1562
02:02:43,791 --> 02:02:48,754
Darling, oh, no husband wants
to come home and see that.

1563
02:02:49,088 --> 02:02:50,714
Oh.

1564
02:02:50,881 --> 02:02:52,341
I didn't have time to get fixed up.

1565
02:02:52,508 --> 02:02:54,468
You know, Hilly, if I didn't
know any better,

1566
02:02:54,635 --> 02:02:58,305
I'd say you've been eating too much pie.

1567
02:03:02,768 --> 02:03:06,063
Mrs. Phelan, I came here...

1568
02:03:06,230 --> 02:03:08,732
In fact, I'm sure of it.

1569
02:03:08,899 --> 02:03:11,110
Now you get your raggedy ass
off my porch.

1570
02:03:11,777 --> 02:03:13,654
Go on.

1571
02:03:13,821 --> 02:03:16,907
Get off my property. Now!

1572
02:03:17,992 --> 02:03:21,245
Before we all get one of those
disgusting things on our lips!

1573
02:03:36,595 --> 02:03:39,848
Eugenia. Take me inside, please.

1574
02:03:40,974 --> 02:03:41,975
Yes, ma'am.

1575
02:03:57,616 --> 02:04:00,619
Skeeter, do you have plans tomorrow?

1576
02:04:01,328 --> 02:04:02,954
- No, ma'am.
- Good.

1577
02:04:04,664 --> 02:04:07,167
Because we are going shopping.

1578
02:04:09,085 --> 02:04:11,546
No single daughter of mine is
going to New York City

1579
02:04:11,713 --> 02:04:13,298
representing the great state
of Mississippi

1580
02:04:13,465 --> 02:04:15,884
without a proper cosmopolitan wardrobe.

1581
02:04:16,051 --> 02:04:17,427
How do you know about New York?

1582
02:04:17,594 --> 02:04:20,389
Oh, well, Miss Stein called last night.

1583
02:04:28,105 --> 02:04:31,025
Courage sometimes skips a generation.

1584
02:04:33,986 --> 02:04:36,781
Thank you for bringing it back
to our family.

1585
02:04:46,082 --> 02:04:48,209
I can't leave you like this.

1586
02:04:48,709 --> 02:04:51,837
Eugenia, I have made a decision.

1587
02:04:52,004 --> 02:04:54,465
My health's been on the uptick
these last few weeks,

1588
02:04:54,632 --> 02:04:57,802
and I know the doctor says it's
some kind of last strength nonsense,

1589
02:04:57,968 --> 02:05:02,390
but I have decided not to die.

1590
02:05:07,895 --> 02:05:09,063
Oh, Mama.

1591
02:05:09,230 --> 02:05:10,940
It's too late.
I tried calling Fanny Mae's

1592
02:05:11,107 --> 02:05:13,360
to make all your hair appointments
for the next 20 years,

1593
02:05:13,527 --> 02:05:15,946
but they wouldn't allow it.

1594
02:05:18,240 --> 02:05:22,702
I have never been more proud of you.

1595
02:05:27,624 --> 02:05:29,334
Thank you.

1596
02:05:37,968 --> 02:05:39,344
Mama.

1597
02:06:07,540 --> 02:06:09,041
Need some help with those?

1598
02:06:11,210 --> 02:06:12,420
Minny.

1599
02:06:12,587 --> 02:06:14,463
- Miss Celia!
- Minny, hey, stop! Minny!

1600
02:06:14,630 --> 02:06:16,257
- Miss Celia!
- Minny!

1601
02:06:16,424 --> 02:06:20,303
- Stay back!
- I'm not here to hurt you! Girl...

1602
02:06:22,221 --> 02:06:23,890
You gonna put the stick down?

1603
02:06:24,056 --> 02:06:25,766
Uh-uh.

1604
02:06:28,436 --> 02:06:31,981
Listen, Celia finally told me
about the babies.

1605
02:06:33,191 --> 02:06:34,525
All of them.

1606
02:06:36,319 --> 02:06:39,989
But I also know, the minute
you started working here,

1607
02:06:40,156 --> 02:06:41,991
she started getting better.

1608
02:06:43,117 --> 02:06:44,952
So, you saved her life.

1609
02:06:48,414 --> 02:06:51,125
You knew I was here the whole time?

1610
02:06:51,292 --> 02:06:54,587
Fried chicken and okra
on the first night?

1611
02:06:55,796 --> 02:06:58,299
Y'all could have at least put
some cornpone on the table.

1612
02:07:01,011 --> 02:07:02,179
No.

1613
02:07:03,847 --> 02:07:06,183
I couldn't let you eat no more cornpone,
Mr. Johnny.

1614
02:07:06,350 --> 02:07:09,186
Thanks to you, now I've had to let out
every pair of pants I own.

1615
02:07:17,194 --> 02:07:19,529
You just leave that.

1616
02:07:20,197 --> 02:07:21,531
Here you go.

1617
02:07:22,532 --> 02:07:24,201
Let's head on up the house.

1618
02:07:48,850 --> 02:07:49,977
What's this?

1619
02:07:50,852 --> 02:07:52,521
I cooked it all by myself.

1620
02:07:52,688 --> 02:07:55,274
Yes, she did.
She was up all night.

1621
02:07:56,859 --> 02:07:58,986
I wanted to do something special.

1622
02:08:00,238 --> 02:08:02,365
I wanted to say thank you.

1623
02:08:05,535 --> 02:08:06,536
So...

1624
02:08:07,578 --> 02:08:09,163
...I ain't losing my job?

1625
02:08:11,165 --> 02:08:14,836
No, you got a job here
for the rest of your life.

1626
02:08:15,002 --> 02:08:16,212
If you want it.

1627
02:08:22,552 --> 02:08:24,679
That's a mile-high meringue, Miss Celia.

1628
02:08:34,105 --> 02:08:36,357
- Please.
- Thank you.

1629
02:08:40,361 --> 02:08:42,321
Ooh.

1630
02:08:42,447 --> 02:08:43,948
You remember to check the thighs?

1631
02:08:44,073 --> 02:08:47,703
- Mm-hm. Cooked clean through.
- Ain't pink in the middle?

1632
02:08:47,828 --> 02:08:51,039
Uh-uh. Just the way you taught me.

1633
02:08:51,165 --> 02:08:53,041
Looky here.

1634
02:08:56,879 --> 02:08:59,882
That table of food
gave Minny the strength she needed.

1635
02:09:00,966 --> 02:09:05,596
She took her babies out from under Leroy
and never went back.

1636
02:09:10,100 --> 02:09:12,728
What are all these cars
doing out here? Are we late?

1637
02:09:12,895 --> 02:09:14,271
No, we ain't late.

1638
02:09:15,856 --> 02:09:16,940
Why ain't you singing?

1639
02:09:17,065 --> 02:09:19,193
We got to worry about getting
in there and getting our seats.

1640
02:09:19,359 --> 02:09:20,611
Come on now, we late!

1641
02:09:29,536 --> 02:09:32,873
- Who we clapping for?
- Honey, we clapping for you!

1642
02:09:36,376 --> 02:09:38,128
Come on down, Sister Clark!

1643
02:09:39,004 --> 02:09:40,214
Come on.

1644
02:09:58,358 --> 02:09:59,817
Come on.

1645
02:10:02,570 --> 02:10:03,947
All right, all right.

1646
02:10:05,531 --> 02:10:10,745
Now, uh... this is an important time
in our community.

1647
02:10:11,496 --> 02:10:15,750
And we have to thank you
for what you have done.

1648
02:10:18,127 --> 02:10:19,254
Now...

1649
02:10:20,380 --> 02:10:23,007
We know you couldn't put
your name in here,

1650
02:10:24,425 --> 02:10:26,177
so we all signed our own.

1651
02:10:28,554 --> 02:10:29,681
Thank you.

1652
02:10:31,975 --> 02:10:35,813
Come on, now. Come on.

1653
02:11:13,350 --> 02:11:17,229
Churches over two counties
signed our books. All for you and me.

1654
02:11:21,233 --> 02:11:22,609
It's beautiful.

1655
02:11:25,904 --> 02:11:27,030
What's wrong?

1656
02:11:33,246 --> 02:11:35,749
I got a job offer from Harper and Row
in New York.

1657
02:11:36,332 --> 02:11:38,126
Congratulations!

1658
02:11:38,293 --> 02:11:41,921
- I'm not taking it.
- What you mean you're not taking it?

1659
02:11:42,046 --> 02:11:43,673
I can't just leave you two here

1660
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:46,259
when things are getting bad
from the mess that I created.

1661
02:11:46,426 --> 02:11:51,181
No. If bad things happen,
ain't nothing you can do about it.

1662
02:11:51,347 --> 02:11:53,725
And now it's for a reason
we can be proud of.

1663
02:11:55,977 --> 02:11:57,979
I don't mean to rub salt in your wound,

1664
02:11:58,146 --> 02:12:00,648
but you ain't got a good life here
in Jackson.

1665
02:12:00,774 --> 02:12:02,275
Plus, your mama's getting better.

1666
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:05,778
You ain't got nothing left here
but enemies in the Junior League.

1667
02:12:05,945 --> 02:12:07,864
You done burned every bridge there is.

1668
02:12:08,031 --> 02:12:10,533
And you ain't never gonna
get another man in this town.

1669
02:12:10,658 --> 02:12:12,911
Everybody know that.

1670
02:12:13,036 --> 02:12:16,456
So don't walk your white butt
to New York, run it!

1671
02:12:18,458 --> 02:12:22,129
Looky here, Miss Skeeter.
I'm gonna take care of Aibileen.

1672
02:12:24,298 --> 02:12:26,091
And she's gonna take care of me.

1673
02:12:37,853 --> 02:12:40,356
Go find your life, Miss Skeeter.

1674
02:12:53,911 --> 02:12:56,288
Aibileen, can you come in here, please?

1675
02:13:02,419 --> 02:13:03,462
Good morning.

1676
02:13:04,213 --> 02:13:09,093
Aibileen, the silver
I lent Elizabeth last week.

1677
02:13:09,260 --> 02:13:11,387
It not polished good?

1678
02:13:11,512 --> 02:13:14,765
Humidity been fighting me
on polishing day.

1679
02:13:14,932 --> 02:13:19,604
When you returned it, three pieces
were missing from the felt wrapper.

1680
02:13:20,939 --> 02:13:24,192
A fork and two spoons.

1681
02:13:24,359 --> 02:13:27,904
Let me... Let me go check in the
kitchen. Maybe I left some behind.

1682
02:13:28,071 --> 02:13:31,116
You know as well as I do that silver's
not in the kitchen.

1683
02:13:33,451 --> 02:13:35,704
You check in Mae Mobley's bed?

1684
02:13:36,830 --> 02:13:38,957
Since the Lil Man was born,
she been putting things...

1685
02:13:39,082 --> 02:13:40,834
Do you hear her, Elizabeth?

1686
02:13:41,876 --> 02:13:43,670
She's trying to blame it on a toddler.

1687
02:13:45,839 --> 02:13:47,507
I ain't got no silver.

1688
02:13:47,674 --> 02:13:49,759
She says she doesn't have them.

1689
02:13:50,260 --> 02:13:54,514
Then it behooves me to inform you
that you are Tired, Aibileen.

1690
02:13:55,640 --> 02:13:57,809
And I'll be calling the police.

1691
02:13:59,728 --> 02:14:02,522
Aibee, my throat hurts.

1692
02:14:04,691 --> 02:14:07,402
I'll go get some syrup, Miss Leefolt.

1693
02:14:08,111 --> 02:14:10,614
Elizabeth can take care
of her own children.

1694
02:14:14,035 --> 02:14:16,871
- I'll go get the cough syrup.
- Come here, Lil Man.

1695
02:14:17,038 --> 02:14:18,456
I'm OK.

1696
02:14:28,841 --> 02:14:30,885
I didn't steal no silver.

1697
02:14:31,052 --> 02:14:34,764
Maybe I can't send you to jail
for what you wrote,

1698
02:14:34,930 --> 02:14:36,807
but I can send you for being a thief.

1699
02:14:36,974 --> 02:14:39,393
I know something about you.
Don't you forget that.

1700
02:14:40,102 --> 02:14:43,230
From what Yule Mae says, there's a lot
of time to write letters in jail.

1701
02:14:43,397 --> 02:14:47,067
Plenty of time to write the truth
about you. And the paper is free.

1702
02:14:47,234 --> 02:14:49,904
- Nobody will believe what you wrote!
- I don't know!

1703
02:14:50,446 --> 02:14:53,741
I been told I'm a pretty good writer.
Already sold a lot of books.

1704
02:14:58,496 --> 02:15:00,664
Call the police, Elizabeth.

1705
02:15:01,415 --> 02:15:04,127
All you do is scare and lie
to try to get what you want.

1706
02:15:04,294 --> 02:15:05,295
Aibileen, stop!

1707
02:15:05,462 --> 02:15:07,506
You a godless woman.

1708
02:15:09,549 --> 02:15:11,635
Ain't you tired, Miss Hilly?

1709
02:15:14,304 --> 02:15:15,639
Ain't you tired?

1710
02:15:29,069 --> 02:15:31,488
Aibileen, you have to go now.

1711
02:15:46,127 --> 02:15:48,547
Don't go, Aibee.

1712
02:15:49,756 --> 02:15:52,092
Baby, you need to get back to bed.

1713
02:15:52,634 --> 02:15:56,681
- Please don't leave.
- I gots to, baby. I am so sorry.

1714
02:15:56,847 --> 02:15:59,600
Are you going to take care
of another little girl?

1715
02:15:59,767 --> 02:16:01,727
No, that's not the reason.

1716
02:16:01,894 --> 02:16:05,439
I don't want to leave you,
but it's time for me to retire.

1717
02:16:05,606 --> 02:16:07,858
- You're my last little girl.
- No!

1718
02:16:08,025 --> 02:16:10,027
Baby. Baby.

1719
02:16:11,028 --> 02:16:13,531
I need you to remember everything
I told you, OK?

1720
02:16:13,698 --> 02:16:15,825
- OK.
- You remember what I told you?

1721
02:16:15,992 --> 02:16:21,414
You is kind. You is smart.

1722
02:16:21,580 --> 02:16:23,249
You is important.

1723
02:16:23,416 --> 02:16:25,293
That's right, Baby Girl.

1724
02:16:30,506 --> 02:16:31,966
Don't go, Aibee.

1725
02:16:32,133 --> 02:16:33,342
I gots to, baby.

1726
02:16:36,012 --> 02:16:37,930
You give my sweet girl a chance.

1727
02:16:54,239 --> 02:16:56,491
Mae Mobley was my last baby.

1728
02:16:58,952 --> 02:17:01,830
In just ten minutes,
the only life I knew was done.

1729
02:17:01,997 --> 02:17:04,708
Aibee!

1730
02:17:08,086 --> 02:17:10,172
God says we need to love our enemies.

1731
02:17:10,338 --> 02:17:11,673
No!

1732
02:17:13,592 --> 02:17:14,926
It hard to do.

1733
02:17:21,183 --> 02:17:23,310
But it can start by telling the truth.

1734
02:17:28,482 --> 02:17:32,069
No one had ever asked me
what it felt like to be me.

1735
02:17:35,447 --> 02:17:37,491
Once I told the truth about that...

1736
02:17:39,493 --> 02:17:41,161
...I felt free.

1737
02:17:49,587 --> 02:17:52,673
And I got to thinking
about all the people I know.

1738
02:17:54,717 --> 02:17:56,719
And the things I seen and done.

1739
02:18:02,475 --> 02:18:06,813
My boy, Treelore, always said we going
to have a writer in the family one day.

1740
02:18:10,149 --> 02:18:12,276
I guess it's gonna be me.

1741
02:18:30,005 --> 02:18:36,005
