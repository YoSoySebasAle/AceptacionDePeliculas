She was completely
wrecked. I know.

00:05:36,424 --> 00:05:40,125
I know, it was... it
was pure insanity.

58
00:05:40,747 --> 00:05:42,216
"It was insanity?"

59
00:05:44,694 --> 00:05:47,151
Lunacy. "It was pure lunacy."

60
00:05:57,703 --> 00:05:59,908
What is his problem? I should go.

61
00:06:08,087 --> 00:06:10,492
- Cappuccino, please.
- Right. Of course.

62
00:06:10,695 --> 00:06:13,722
- On us.
- Oh no thank you. I insist.

63
00:06:43,556 --> 00:06:45,060
AUDITION.

64
00:06:45,896 --> 00:06:46,936
Shit.

65
00:06:47,435 --> 00:06:49,307
Mia, where do you
think you're going?

66
00:06:49,308 --> 00:06:50,384
Oh, it's five after.

67
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:52,509
- You better be early tomorrow.
- Okay.

68
00:06:54,197 --> 00:06:55,449
Have a good night.

69
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:11,316
She was wrecked

70
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:14,116
It was pure lunacy. It was...

71
00:07:14,323 --> 00:07:16,828
It was so crazy and I just...

72
00:07:17,332 --> 00:07:18,588
Oh you would have died.

73
00:07:20,552 --> 00:07:23,715
No, Turner is fine.
Turner is fine. I just...

74
00:07:25,568 --> 00:07:28,350
Are you going to wait until
Denver to tell her, or?

75
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:33,173
What?

76
00:07:42,752 --> 00:07:43,792
Okay.

77
00:07:48,862 --> 00:07:50,601
No, I'm happy for you.

78
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:55,272
I am. I'm happy for you. I just...

79
00:07:58,678 --> 00:07:59,992
I just thought...

80
00:08:03,903 --> 00:08:05,463
I don't know what I thought
I guess it just...

81
00:08:05,464 --> 00:08:06,464
I'm sorry.

82
00:08:08,077 --> 00:08:10,609
- What Ruby?
- Jessica called.

83
00:08:11,663 --> 00:08:14,307
- Tell her I call her back.
- In two minutes?

84
00:08:15,493 --> 00:08:16,527
Less than two minutes.

85
00:08:16,528 --> 00:08:18,648
- I'll go get your lunch.
- I'm almost done. Thank you.

86
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:30,196
Oh you know what? I
think we're good.

87
00:08:30,197 --> 00:08:31,457
Thanks for coming in.

88
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,944
Holy shit. You want
to open a window?

89
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:40,095
It was trying to give
you an entrance.

90
00:09:40,096 --> 00:09:41,096
Thank you.

91
00:09:41,109 --> 00:09:43,136
Mia. How the audition go?

92
00:09:45,206 --> 00:09:47,445
Same here. Was Jen
there? Or Rachel?

93
00:09:47,547 --> 00:09:49,389
I do not know who
Jen and Rachel are.

94
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,402
They are the worst.

95
00:09:50,403 --> 00:09:53,636
- I don't know if they were there.
- I bet that they were.

96
00:09:53,637 --> 00:09:55,639
Why is there a convention
in the bathroom?

97
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,680
Oh right.

98
00:09:56,806 --> 00:09:59,114
Two minutes people. Mia
you're coming, right?

99
00:09:59,408 --> 00:10:00,621
I can't.

100
00:10:01,015 --> 00:10:02,076
I'm working.

101
00:10:02,095 --> 00:10:03,135
What?

102
00:10:03,665 --> 00:10:05,306
Did she just say "working"?

103
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:09,461
- What?
- Sorry it didn't go well today.

104
00:10:09,462 --> 00:10:11,113
And there's like four
things in my inbox that

105
00:10:11,114 --> 00:10:12,621
you're perfect for and
I will submit you.

106
00:10:12,622 --> 00:10:14,174
But right now, you're coming.

107
00:10:14,554 --> 00:10:15,799
It will be fun.

108
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,009
It's not gonna be fun.

109
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,283
- It could be.
- It's not.

110
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,162
It's gonna be a bunch
of social climbers.

111
00:10:20,163 --> 00:10:22,931
All packed into one of
those big glass houses.

112
00:10:22,932 --> 00:10:24,041
This looks familiar.

113
00:10:24,435 --> 00:10:26,879
- I was gonna give that back.
- How long have you had this?

114
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,520
- Come on Mia.
- A long time.

115
00:10:28,903 --> 00:10:31,485
When else are you gonna get to
see a very Hollywood cliche...

116
00:10:31,486 --> 00:10:33,679
crammed into the same room?
We'll make fun of it together.

117
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:37,306
"I'm disappointed in you, Lex."
There's nothing to make fun of.

118
00:10:37,307 --> 00:10:40,197

Please stop sneaking into my home.

158
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,597
Do you think Mum and Dad
would call this a "home"?

The Baked Potato
just threw it away.

Davis pissed on it?

170
00:18:38,697 --> 00:18:39,750
It's almost insulting.

171
00:18:40,712 --> 00:18:41,752
Is it true?

172
00:18:41,765 --> 00:18:43,924

unpack these boxes?

00:18:46,323 --> 00:18:47,323
Oh, Sebastian.

175
00:18:47,324 --> 00:18:49,882
It's like a girl broke up with
you and you're stalking her.

176
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:51,528
You're not still going
by there, are you?

177
00:18:52,136 --> 00:18:54,087
That's...

178
00:18:54,275 --> 00:18:56,630
I can't believe they turned
it into a samba-tapas place.

179
00:18:56,631 --> 00:18:59,394
- Oh my god, Sebastian.
- Samba. Tapas.

180
00:19:00,335 --> 00:19:02,867
Pick one, you know. Do one right.

181
00:19:02,868 --> 00:19:04,507
I have someone I want you to meet.

182
00:19:05,078 --> 00:19:06,278
I don't want to meet anyone.

183
00:19:06,709 --> 00:19:08,032
No... no, I don't
want to meet anyone.

184
00:19:08,033 --> 00:19:09,033
Dad gave you this?

185
00:19:09,034 --> 00:19:10,034
- Yes.
- You'll like her.

186
00:19:10,553 --> 00:19:11,653
I don't think I'm gonna like her.

187
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:13,699
- Does she like jazz?
- Probably not.

188
00:19:13,906 --> 00:19:15,236
Then what are we gonna talk about?

189
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,710
I don't know. It
doesn't matter, okay?

190
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:18,604
Because you're living
like a hermit.

191
00:19:18,605 --> 00:19:20,192
You're driving without insurance.

192
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:21,493
- Doesn't matter?
- Yes. Doesn't matter.

193
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,749
- Okay.
- You need to get serious.

194
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,674
Well then I know a guy with a
face tattoo you should see.

195
00:19:24,675 --> 00:19:26,009
- Okay, low blow.
- With a heart of gold.

196
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,627
- Get serious.
- Get serious? Laura...

197
00:19:28,657 --> 00:19:31,509
I had a very serious
plan for my future.

198
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,510
I know.

199
00:19:32,511 --> 00:19:34,567
It's not my fault
I got Shanghaied.

200
00:19:34,592 --> 00:19:37,622
You didn't get Shanghaied.
You got ripped off.

201
00:19:37,934 --> 00:19:39,041
What's the difference?

202
00:19:39,091 --> 00:19:41,273
I don't know. It's not
as romantic as that.

203
00:19:42,326 --> 00:19:43,366
Don't sit...

204
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,825
Everybody knew that guy was
shady, except for you.

205
00:19:48,261 --> 00:19:51,850
Why do you say "romantic"
like it's a dirty word?

206
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,223
Unpaid bills are not
romantic. Call her.

207
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:56,869
I'm not going to call her.

208
00:19:57,124 --> 00:20:00,558
The thing is... You're acting
like life's got me on the ropes.

209
00:20:00,604 --> 00:20:02,662
I want to be on the ropes.

210
00:20:02,663 --> 00:20:05,621
Okay? I'm just... I'm letting
life hit me until it gets tired.

211
00:20:05,822 --> 00:20:09,217
And then I'm gonna hit back.
It's a classic "rope-a-dope".

212
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,526
Okay, Ali. I love you.
Unpack your boxes.

213
00:20:13,722 --> 00:20:16,208
- I'm gonna change the locks.
- You can't afford it.

214
00:20:17,485 --> 00:20:20,230
I am a phoenix rising
from the ashes.

215
00:21:07,755 --> 00:21:08,755
Hey.

216
00:21:08,756 --> 00:21:10,187
Hey Bill, thanks for
letting me back.

217
00:21:10,188 --> 00:21:11,188
You're welcome.

218
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,944
I want you to know that
you're looking at a new man.

219
00:21:12,945 --> 00:21:13,945
Good.

220
00:21:13,948 --> 00:21:15,428
- A man that's happy to be here.
- Excellent.

221
00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:16,651
Very easy to work with.

222
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:18,508
And you're gonna
play the set list?

223
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:19,549
Happy to.

224
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:22,133
Even though I don't think
anybody cares what I play.

225
00:21:22,134 --> 00:21:23,134
But yeah.

226
00:21:23,135 --> 00:21:24,665
Well, if by "anyone"
you mean anyone

227
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,555
other than me, that
would be correct.

228
00:21:26,556 --> 00:21:28,331
I care, and I don't wanna
hear the free jazz.

229
00:21:28,332 --> 00:21:30,292
Right. Okay.

230
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:33,447
Although I thought that in this
town worked on a sort of...

231
00:21:33,448 --> 00:21:34,964
"one for you, one for
me" type system.

232
00:21:35,904 --> 00:21:37,526
How about two for you, one for me?

233
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:40,997
How about all for you
and none for me?

234
00:21:40,998 --> 00:21:42,470
- That's perfect. Yes.
- Great.

235
00:21:42,471 --> 00:21:43,989
- Okay.
- Okay. Mutual decision.

236
00:21:44,024 --> 00:21:45,436
Right. Made... made by me.

237
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,720
Right. And I signed
off on it so...

238
00:21:47,721 --> 00:21:49,655
Whatever. Tell yourself
what you wanna know.

239
00:21:50,671 --> 00:21:52,405
Hello. Welcome back.

240
00:21:54,226 --> 00:21:55,969
There's a nice way
to say that, Karen.

241
00:24:59,294 --> 00:25:00,360
Seb.

242
00:25:12,965 --> 00:25:14,659
I do... I do... I hear
what you're saying. But

243
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,208
I don't think you're
saying what you mean.

244
00:25:16,209 --> 00:25:18,286
Yeah, I don't think you hear
what I'm saying. You're fired.

245
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:19,782
Well I... That's what
you're saying but

246
00:25:19,783 --> 00:25:21,273
that's not what you
mean. You mean is.

247
00:25:21,366 --> 00:25:22,406
You're fired.

248
00:25:22,637 --> 00:25:23,978
Play the set list.

249
00:25:24,671 --> 00:25:26,127
No. What I'm saying is "too late".

250
00:25:26,128 --> 00:25:27,128
It is a warning.

251
00:25:27,136 --> 00:25:28,697
What... what planet are you from?

252
00:25:28,698 --> 00:25:31,093
- Don't fire me. Don't fire me.
- You're done. I'm sorry, Seb.

253
00:25:31,794 --> 00:25:33,031
It's Christmas.

254
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,927
Yeah, I see the decorations.
Good luck in the New Year.

255
00:25:50,231 --> 00:25:52,674
I just heard you play,
and I wanted to...

256
00:26:06,903 --> 00:26:08,899
I don't like the fissure
on the GT scan.

257
00:26:09,461 --> 00:26:11,472
Did you test for achromatopsia?

258
00:26:11,786 --> 00:26:15,177
D.O.A. on 23rd, perp laughing
his face off at the P.D.

259
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:17,101
Damn Miranda Rights.

260
00:26:17,112 --> 00:26:18,982
This is my classroom.

261
00:26:19,118 --> 00:26:21,045
You don't like it, the
door's to my left.

262
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,537
Lady why you be
tripping like that?

263
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,548
No, Jamal.

264
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:28,212
You be tripping.

265
00:26:49,203 --> 00:26:50,361
Mia.

266
00:26:50,515 --> 00:26:52,217
- Hi.
- Hi.

267
00:26:52,931 --> 00:26:54,731
I want you to meet
my friend Carlo.

268
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,290
- Hi. Carlo.
- This is Mia.

269
00:26:56,291 --> 00:26:57,565
- Nice. Mia?
- Yes, Mia.

270
00:26:57,566 --> 00:26:59,441
- Hi. How are you?
- Carlo is a writer.

271
00:26:59,503 --> 00:27:01,400
Yeah. They say I have
a knack for world

272
00:27:01,401 --> 00:27:03,345
building. I got a lot
of heat right now.

273
00:27:03,392 --> 00:27:04,434
It's from a lot of buzz, people

274
00:27:04,435 --> 00:27:05,745
talking about me.
It's just exciting.

275
00:27:05,757 --> 00:27:07,436
You work so hard and then
all of it validated...

276
00:27:07,437 --> 00:27:08,437
I'm gonna go grab a drink.

277
00:27:08,438 --> 00:27:09,438
- Yeah.
- Okay.

278
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,472
It's really nice to meet you.

279
00:27:31,786 --> 00:27:32,993
Sorry.

280
00:28:01,628 --> 00:28:04,374
Thank you. Any other requests?

281
00:28:07,673 --> 00:28:08,838
The girl in the front.

282
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:13,282
- "I Ran".
- "I Ran". A fantastic suggestion.

283
00:28:14,204 --> 00:28:16,809
All right, piano man, tickle
those ivories. Let's hit it.

284
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:18,950
One two three four.

285
00:28:30,265 --> 00:28:31,360

All right. I remember you.

296
00:29:32,338 --> 00:29:34,944
And I would admit I was a
little curt that night.

297
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:35,980
"Curt"?

298
00:29:35,981 --> 00:29:37,862
Okay, I was an asshole.
I can admit that.

299
00:29:37,863 --> 00:29:38,863
Okay.

300
00:29:38,864 --> 00:29:40,797
But requesting "I
Ran" from a serious

301
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:42,612
musician is just... it's too far.

302
00:29:42,638 --> 00:29:45,836
My Lord. Did you just say
"a serious musician"?

303
00:29:45,903 --> 00:29:46,903
I don't think so.

304
00:29:46,904 --> 00:29:48,282
Can I borrow what you're wearing?

305
00:29:48,283 --> 00:29:49,283
Why?

306
00:29:49,284 --> 00:29:50,620
Because I have an
audition next week.

307
00:29:50,621 --> 00:29:52,061
I'm playing a serious firefighter.

308
00:29:52,063 --> 00:29:53,834
So you're an actress.
I thought you look

309
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:55,518
familiar. Have I seen
you on anything?

310
00:29:56,971 --> 00:30:00,115
A coffee shop on the Warner
Bros. Lot. That's classic.

311
00:30:00,116 --> 00:30:01,116
- Oh, I see.
- Yeah.

312
00:30:01,198 --> 00:30:02,321
You're a barista.

313
00:30:02,322 --> 00:30:03,861
And I can see how
you could then look

314
00:30:03,862 --> 00:30:05,400
down on me from all
the way up there.

315
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:06,961
Next set.

316
00:30:08,452 --> 00:30:09,904
He doesn't... I don't...

317
00:30:10,668 --> 00:30:12,148
He doesn't tell me what to do.

318
00:30:12,431 --> 00:30:15,247
- He just told you what to...
- I know. I let him.

319
00:30:15,726 --> 00:30:16,780
What is your name?

320
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:17,782
- Mia.
- Mia.

321
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,360
I guess I'll see
you in the movies.

322
00:30:23,804 --> 00:30:26,375
- You know Joseph Campbell?
- Yeah.

323
00:30:26,376 --> 00:30:27,773
I have this idea that
you were reimagining

324
00:30:27,774 --> 00:30:28,943
"Goldilocks and the
Three Bears"...

325
00:30:28,944 --> 00:30:30,395
from the perspective of the bears.

326
00:30:30,442 --> 00:30:32,269
- You know it's thrilling.
- It could be a franchise.

327
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,270
Right.

328
00:30:33,282 --> 00:30:35,549
So well we don't know if they were
cooped up up there. We don't know.

329
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,550
George Michael.

330
00:30:42,206 --> 00:30:43,206
Hello.

331
00:30:43,268 --> 00:30:45,155
Sorry. It's... I know that guy.

332
00:30:45,675 --> 00:30:46,964
Did you get your keys?

333
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,916
- Yes.
- Can you grab mine?

334
00:30:52,516 --> 00:30:53,516
Sorry what?

335
00:30:53,517 --> 00:30:55,129
Will you be able to
grab my... my keys?

336
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:56,130
I can't hear you.

337
00:30:56,131 --> 00:30:57,915
- Sorry, can you grab my keys?
- Oh.

338
00:30:58,981 --> 00:31:00,538
- Please.
- Oh, there we go.

339
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:01,754
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

340
00:31:04,414 --> 00:31:06,062
- What kind?
- It's a Prius.

341
00:31:08,962 --> 00:31:12,230
- That doesn't help me.
- With a green ribbon.

342
00:31:12,517 --> 00:31:13,557
All right.

343
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:18,607
Those look, comfortable.

344
00:31:19,188 --> 00:31:20,242
They are.

345
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,943
Thank you for saving
the day back there.

346
00:31:26,086 --> 00:31:28,629
Well, you didn't really
give me much of a choice.

347
00:31:29,807 --> 00:31:32,341
It's pretty strange that we
keep running into each other.

348
00:31:33,109 --> 00:31:34,220
It is strange.

349
00:31:36,038 --> 00:31:37,642
- Maybe it means something.
- I doubt it.

350
00:31:37,643 --> 00:31:39,605
- Yeah. I don't think so.
- Where's my car?

351
00:31:40,761 --> 00:31:42,369
Put that thing to your chin.

352
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:43,937
- This?
- Yeah.

353
00:31:45,276 --> 00:31:46,778
It makes your head
into an antenna.

354
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:49,248
I think it gives you cancer
but you find your car faster.

355
00:31:49,249 --> 00:31:50,249
What?

356
00:31:50,336 --> 00:31:51,636
I mean you don't get
to live as long

357
00:31:51,637 --> 00:31:52,826
but you get where you're going...

358
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,597
- quicker so it all evens out.
- That sounds terrible.

359
00:31:54,598 --> 00:31:55,806
Just a suggestion.

360
00:31:57,442 --> 00:31:59,264
You're a real...

361
00:31:59,325 --> 00:32:00,853
What's the word am I looking for?

362
00:32:00,854 --> 00:32:02,041
Knight in shining armour.

363
00:32:02,042 --> 00:32:04,826
- Weirdo. That was the word.
- Okay.

364
00:32:11,743 --> 00:32:13,274
Not much to look at, huh?

365
00:32:14,292 --> 00:32:15,400

Hi. Oh, sorry I'm late.

397
00:36:23,722 --> 00:36:25,905
Yeah. Very soon. Okay. Bye.

398
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,840
- It's just right there.
- Just right here.

399
00:36:54,744 --> 00:36:56,184
Do you want a ride to your car?

400
00:36:57,588 --> 00:36:59,053
No, I'm just right up here.

401
00:37:02,355 --> 00:37:03,395
Good night.

402
00:37:10,089 --> 00:37:11,129
Good night.

403
00:38:23,822 --> 00:38:26,598
Excuse me. This is
gluten free, right?

404
00:38:27,517 --> 00:38:29,077
- No.
- What?

405
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,408
I'd like a refund.

406
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:36,779
Okay. Let me check it out.

407
00:38:38,513 --> 00:38:41,153
Mia, you're closing Friday.

408
00:38:42,109 --> 00:38:45,012
I can't close on Friday. I
have an audition, remember?

409
00:38:45,013 --> 00:38:46,840
Do I look like I care?
We schedule it.

410
00:38:47,712 --> 00:38:50,329
Oh and we need to have a
little talk tomorrow, okay?

411
00:38:50,554 --> 00:38:53,064
- Fix your apron, please.
- Okay.

412
00:38:58,332 --> 00:38:59,372
You again.

413
00:39:01,843 --> 00:39:02,883
What are you doing here?

414
00:39:02,887 --> 00:39:06,061
You know, just meetings
and studio heads.

415
00:39:06,482 --> 00:39:07,562
How did you get on the lot?

416
00:39:08,365 --> 00:39:10,738
I basically just run
past the guard gates.

417
00:39:11,092 --> 00:39:13,520
I think I have 20 minutes
until they find me.

418
00:39:14,036 --> 00:39:15,783
You have a break
coming up, do you?

419
00:39:15,784 --> 00:39:16,978
I'm off in ten minutes.

420
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:20,649
Can I hide in the bathroom?

421
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:21,814
- Yes.
- Okay.

422
00:39:23,835 --> 00:39:24,971
Sorry.

423
00:39:26,426 --> 00:39:28,664
I actually do have
to check. I'm sorry.

424
00:39:32,531 --> 00:39:34,362
That's the window
that Humphrey Bogart

425
00:39:34,363 --> 00:39:36,609
and Ingrid Bergman looked
out of in Casablanca.

426
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:37,610
- Wow.
- Yeah.

427
00:39:37,611 --> 00:39:39,652
I can't believe you work right
across the street from there.

428
00:39:39,653 --> 00:39:40,912
- Yeah.
- That's amazing.

429
00:39:41,366 --> 00:39:44,170
What was you're,
you're Bogart's name?

430
00:39:45,171 --> 00:39:47,020
What's his name? Is it Greg?

431
00:39:47,557 --> 00:39:49,164
Yeah, Greg.

432
00:39:49,605 --> 00:39:52,312
Right. How long have you been...?

433
00:39:52,313 --> 00:39:54,404
We've been seeing each
other for about a month.

434
00:39:54,405 --> 00:39:55,405
That's great.

435
00:39:55,958 --> 00:39:59,555
It's sweet. Anyway, I love being
around this stuff. You know?

436
00:39:59,556 --> 00:40:02,188
I know what you mean. I get
coffee 5 miles out of the way...

437
00:40:02,189 --> 00:40:03,955
just so I can be near a jazz club.

438
00:40:03,956 --> 00:40:04,956
Really?

439
00:40:04,957 --> 00:40:06,621
Yeah, the Van Beek.
Do you know it?

440
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,498
All the big swing
bands used to play

441
00:40:08,499 --> 00:40:10,049
there. Count Basie, Chick Webb.

442
00:40:11,178 --> 00:40:14,027
Anyway, it's a samba-tapas
place now, so...

443
00:40:15,065 --> 00:40:16,516
What's a samba-tapas place?

444
00:40:16,517 --> 00:40:18,709
You know, it's like a samba
place where they serve tapas.

445
00:40:19,212 --> 00:40:20,212
Oh.

446
00:40:20,213 --> 00:40:22,073
Yeah. So the joke's on... history?

447
00:40:22,384 --> 00:40:23,848
I don't know. That's L.A.

448
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:27,479
They just... They worship
everything and they value nothing.

449
00:40:27,693 --> 00:40:29,774
We're about to roll.
Stop please guys.

450
00:40:31,183 --> 00:40:33,036
- You're rolling?
- Yeah.

451
00:40:33,488 --> 00:40:35,425
They shoot movies on my street
all the time so no problem.

452
00:40:35,426 --> 00:40:36,426
- Come this way.
- Right.

453
00:40:36,448 --> 00:40:37,488
It's a lockdown.

454
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,487
- I love her.
- And here we go.

455
00:40:40,545 --> 00:40:42,691
Hey, Mia. How did
you get into this?

456
00:40:42,869 --> 00:40:45,034
- And... roll.
- Get into what?

457
00:40:46,006 --> 00:40:48,130
- You know, movies, acting.
- Action.

458
00:40:49,935 --> 00:40:52,196
- My aunt was an actress.
- Oh, okay.

459
00:40:52,653 --> 00:40:54,713
She was in a travelling
theatre company.

460
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:57,254
I grew up in Boulder City, Nevada.

461
00:40:57,421 --> 00:40:58,804
So across the street
from my house,

462
00:40:58,805 --> 00:41:00,033
there was this little library.

463
00:41:00,034 --> 00:41:01,642
That had an old movies section.

464
00:41:01,685 --> 00:41:04,270
So she... she took me
and spent an entire

465
00:41:04,271 --> 00:41:06,548
day watching all
these old movies...

466
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:10,731
like "Notorious", "Bringing
Up Baby," "Casablanca"...

467
00:41:10,732 --> 00:41:11,732
and...

468
00:41:11,733 --> 00:41:13,396
Cut it there. Cut.
Check the tapes.

469
00:41:13,397 --> 00:41:15,178
- We can talk now.
- She sounds incredible.

470
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:16,890
She was incredible.
And I would put

471
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,600
on all these plays
in my bedroom...

472
00:41:18,648 --> 00:41:21,036
and it would basically
just she and I

473
00:41:21,037 --> 00:41:23,486
re-enacting the scenes
from the movies.

474
00:41:24,093 --> 00:41:25,952
And then I wrote my
own plays. Yeah.

475
00:41:25,953 --> 00:41:26,953
Wow.

476
00:41:48,217 --> 00:41:49,257
I love it.

477
00:41:53,695 --> 00:41:56,821
So anyway, I left college
after two years to come here.

478
00:41:56,822 --> 00:41:59,491
And my last audition
was for a teen soap

479
00:41:59,492 --> 00:42:02,159
pitched as Dangerous
Minds meets The OC.

480
00:42:02,224 --> 00:42:05,567
So yeah, should've been a lawyer.

481
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,139
Because the world
needs more lawyers.

482
00:42:08,957 --> 00:42:10,673
Doesn't need more actresses.

483
00:42:10,755 --> 00:42:12,029
You're not just an actress.

484
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,642
What do you mean
"just an actress"?

485
00:42:13,643 --> 00:42:17,155
You said it yourself. You were
a child prodigy playwright.

486
00:42:17,156 --> 00:42:18,626
That is not what I said.

487
00:42:18,696 --> 00:42:21,238
Well, you're too modest
to say it but it's true.

488
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:23,947
So you could just write
your own roles, you know.

489
00:42:23,965 --> 00:42:26,034
Write something that's as
interesting as you are...

490
00:42:26,098 --> 00:42:28,248
and you don't have to
audition for this pishi kaka.

491
00:42:28,249 --> 00:42:29,249
Yeah.

492
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,455
Look at Louis Armstrong, you know.

493
00:42:30,456 --> 00:42:31,979
He could have just
played the marching

494
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,189
band charts that he was given.

495
00:42:33,332 --> 00:42:35,146
But he didn't do it.
What did he do?

496
00:42:35,147 --> 00:42:36,147
What did he do?

497
00:42:36,148 --> 00:42:37,939
He made history, didn't he?

498
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:39,989
Well, I'm gonna stop
auditioning and

499
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,336
I'm gonna make history instead.

500
00:42:42,402 --> 00:42:44,638
Well, my work is done here.

501
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:48,001
I should probably tell
you something now.

502
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,547
To get it out the way.

503
00:42:49,762 --> 00:42:51,053
I hate jazz.

504
00:42:53,565 --> 00:42:54,605
You okay?

505
00:42:54,737 --> 00:42:56,160
What do you mean you hate jazz?

506
00:42:56,821 --> 00:42:58,810
It just means that when I
listen to it, I don't like it.

507
00:42:58,811 --> 00:42:59,914
Yeah but it's just a blanket

508
00:42:59,915 --> 00:43:01,371
statement that you
don't like jazz.

509
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:03,381
What are you doing right now?

510
00:43:04,755 --> 00:43:05,860
Nothing.

511
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:25,624
You know, I just think
that when people say that,

512
00:43:26,678 --> 00:43:27,960
you know, hate jazz.

513
00:43:29,562 --> 00:43:31,952
They just... they don't
have context. They

514
00:43:31,953 --> 00:43:34,287
don't know where it
comes from. You know?

515
00:43:34,288 --> 00:43:37,867
Jazz was born in a little
flophouse in New Orleans...

516
00:43:37,868 --> 00:43:39,640
and just because
people were crammed in

517
00:43:39,641 --> 00:43:41,589
there, they spoke five
different languages.

518
00:43:41,606 --> 00:43:42,706
They couldn't talk to each other.

519
00:43:42,707 --> 00:43:46,139
The only way that they could
communicate was with jazz.

520
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:48,200
You know, what about Kenny G?

521
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:50,070
What?

522
00:43:50,071 --> 00:43:52,976
What about Kenny G? I mean,
what about elevator music?

523
00:43:53,227 --> 00:43:55,704
You know, jazz music that I know.

524
00:43:55,705 --> 00:43:57,510
- What about it?
- From my life.

525
00:43:57,787 --> 00:44:00,208
I just... I mean find it relaxing.

526
00:44:00,209 --> 00:44:01,622
It's not relaxing. It's not.

527
00:44:01,623 --> 00:44:02,623
It's not.

528
00:44:02,624 --> 00:44:04,140
Sidney Bechet shot
somebody because

529
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,769
he told him he
played a wrong note.

530
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,192
That's hardly relaxing.

531
00:44:07,216 --> 00:44:10,993
Where I grew up, there was
this station called KJAZZ 103.

532
00:44:11,189 --> 00:44:13,032
And people would just
put on that station

533
00:44:13,033 --> 00:44:14,524
when they had a cocktail party...

534
00:44:14,525 --> 00:44:15,554
Right.

535
00:44:15,555 --> 00:44:17,770
And everyone would just
kind of talk over it.

536
00:44:18,187 --> 00:44:20,127
- I know.
- Yes. It was...

537
00:44:20,128 --> 00:44:21,995
Okay, okay. So I think
that that's part of the

538
00:44:21,996 --> 00:44:23,783
problem is that you can't
hear it, you know.

539
00:44:23,784 --> 00:44:25,860
You have to see it, you have
to see what's at stake.

540
00:44:25,861 --> 00:44:29,682
I mean, look at these fellas. Look
at the saxophonist right now.

541
00:44:29,683 --> 00:44:31,489
He just hijacked the song.
He's on his own trail.

542
00:44:31,495 --> 00:44:33,342
Everyone of these
guys are composing,

543
00:44:33,343 --> 00:44:34,897
rearranging, they're writing...

544
00:44:34,898 --> 00:44:36,877
and they're playing the
melody. They're just...

545
00:44:36,878 --> 00:44:39,845
And now look, the trumpet
player. He's got his own idea.

546
00:44:39,846 --> 00:44:43,860
It's so... it's conflict and it's
compromise, and it's just...

547
00:44:44,405 --> 00:44:47,299
It's new every time. It's
brand new every night.

548
00:44:47,374 --> 00:44:49,216
It's very, very exciting.

549
00:44:56,613 --> 00:44:57,707
And it's dying.

550
00:44:58,493 --> 00:45:01,486
It's dying, Mia. It's
dying on the vine.

551
00:45:01,502 --> 00:45:04,863
And the world says, "Let
it die. It had its time".

552
00:45:04,973 --> 00:45:06,245
Well, not on my watch.

553
00:45:08,027 --> 00:45:09,067
What are you gonna do?

554
00:45:09,257 --> 00:45:10,776
I'll have my own club.

555
00:45:11,588 --> 00:45:13,023
- Really?
- Yes.

556
00:45:13,135 --> 00:45:16,158
We're gonna play whatever we
want, whenever we want...

557
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:20,260
however we want, as
long as it's pure jazz.

558
00:45:21,415 --> 00:45:22,937
Hi, this is Mia Dolan.

559
00:45:23,464 --> 00:45:25,015
Yeah, I just missed a call.

560
00:45:32,568 --> 00:45:34,088
- I got a callback.
- What?

561
00:45:34,826 --> 00:45:36,645
Come on. For what?

562
00:45:36,916 --> 00:45:40,089
For a TV show. The one I
was telling you about.

563
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:41,504
The Dangerous Minds meets The OC?

564
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:42,505
Yeah.

565
00:45:42,561 --> 00:45:43,787
Congratulations.
That's incredible.

566
00:45:43,788 --> 00:45:44,788
It's really exciting.

567
00:45:44,789 --> 00:45:46,436
I feel like I said negative
stuff about if before.

568
00:45:46,438 --> 00:45:47,438
What?

569
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,274
It's like "Rebel Without
a Cause" sort of.

570
00:45:49,711 --> 00:45:51,181
"I got the bullets."

571
00:45:52,136 --> 00:45:53,176
Yes.

572
00:45:54,645 --> 00:45:56,365
- You've never seen it.
- I've never seen it.

573
00:45:56,485 --> 00:45:58,905
Oh my. You know it's
playing in the Rialto.

574
00:45:58,985 --> 00:46:00,250
- Really?
- Yes.

575
00:46:00,381 --> 00:46:03,964
You should go. I mean,
I can take you.

576
00:46:04,468 --> 00:46:05,831
- Okay.
- You know, for research.

577
00:46:05,832 --> 00:46:07,289
- For research. Yeah.
- Yeah.

578
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:08,330
Okay.

579
00:46:08,926 --> 00:46:10,669
Monday night, ten o'clock.

580
00:46:10,707 --> 00:46:12,197
- Yeah. Great.
- Okay.

581
00:46:12,412 --> 00:46:13,797
For research.

- Okay. Nice to meet you.

588
00:48:06,029 --> 00:48:08,422
- Hi.
- Hi.

589
00:48:31,841 --> 00:48:33,869
- On your own time.
- Okay.

590
00:48:38,496 --> 00:48:39,671
Two options:

591
00:48:39,784 --> 00:48:42,713
You either follow my rules,
or follow my rules. Capisce?

592
00:48:42,714 --> 00:48:43,714
Thank you.

593
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,338
- Thanks.
- I could do it a different way.

594
00:48:47,369 --> 00:48:49,754
That's... that's fine. Thank
you very much. Thank you.

595
00:48:58,146 --> 00:49:00,289
- That was fun. Thanks.
- Bye.

596
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,277
Hey Mia.

597
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:33,370
- What?
- Greg's here.

598
00:49:33,830 --> 00:49:34,870
What do you mean...?

599
00:49:35,032 --> 00:49:37,355
Hey babe. Got a space out front.

600
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:39,703
- Great.
- We should get going.

601
00:49:39,704 --> 00:49:41,296
My brother landed really early.

602
00:49:44,317 --> 00:49:45,317
Did you forget?

603
00:49:45,318 --> 00:49:46,662
- Shit.
- You forgot.

604
00:49:47,366 --> 00:49:48,499
That's tonight.

605
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:51,376
- That's okay. Yeah. You forgot.
- Yeah. Okay. All right.

606
00:49:51,419 --> 00:49:52,951
So then I'll just get changed.

607
00:49:52,953 --> 00:49:54,691
- Okay. Great.
- Okay. Great.

608
00:49:57,902 --> 00:50:00,206
Yeah, that's him. Hey, Josh. Yeah.

609
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:03,017
Just picking up Mia. We'll
be there in like...

610
00:50:05,135 --> 00:50:07,329
But now we got this
surround sound set-up.

611
00:50:07,477 --> 00:50:09,352
Oh, it's like being
in a movie theatre.

612
00:50:09,353 --> 00:50:11,494
Well, better than being
in a theatre, really.

613
00:50:11,495 --> 00:50:13,495
- I can't wait.
- You know theatres these days.

614
00:50:13,496 --> 00:50:15,421
- Yeah.
- They're so dirty.

615
00:50:15,422 --> 00:50:17,010
Yeah, I know. They smell bad.

616
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:18,696
And they're either
too hot or too cold.

617
00:50:18,697 --> 00:50:20,430
I know, the quality
has gone far and off.

618
00:50:20,431 --> 00:50:22,431
Oh, it's terrible and there's
always people talking.

619
00:50:22,432 --> 00:50:24,995
- Many people.
- Oh it's...

620
00:50:24,996 --> 00:50:27,137
I'm sorry. Just...
hold on a second.

621
00:50:28,466 --> 00:50:30,546
- Hello?
- It's probably work.

622
00:50:36,553 --> 00:50:38,774
Sorry. So you know, we love it.

623
00:50:38,997 --> 00:50:41,024
- It's so nice.
- Well you have to come.

624
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:42,864
You should come by.

625
00:51:01,038 --> 00:51:04,592
I have one more for
you man: Indonesia.

626
00:51:04,593 --> 00:51:06,245
I don't know. I never
heard anyone say that.

627
00:51:06,246 --> 00:51:07,831
I know, you know I can't
even keep track of

628
00:51:07,832 --> 00:51:09,415
it but honestly, it was
just life changing.

629
00:51:09,416 --> 00:51:10,416
- Really.
- Yeah.

630
00:51:12,699 --> 00:51:13,699
Is it amazing?

631
00:51:13,997 --> 00:51:16,332
- Yes.
- A five-star jungle-ECO resort.

632
00:51:16,976 --> 00:51:18,310
- Well, you would not believe.
- Amazing.

633
00:51:18,311 --> 00:51:19,954
We were thinking about
going to Nicaragua.

634
00:51:19,955 --> 00:51:21,784
I think Nicaragua
is less developed.

635
00:51:21,785 --> 00:51:23,245
- It's a bit underdeveloped.
- Right.

636
00:51:23,909 --> 00:51:24,909
It's a little more.

637
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:27,794
I just... I don't know... I
don't know if it's safe there.

638
00:51:27,795 --> 00:51:30,594
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I don't know if it's safe.

639
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:02,098
I'm sorry.

640
00:53:36,501 --> 00:53:38,600
An immensity of our universe.

641
00:53:38,801 --> 00:53:41,400
For many days, before
the end of our Earth,

642
00:53:41,701 --> 00:53:44,900
people will look into the
night sky and notice a star,

643
00:53:45,201 --> 00:53:48,300
increasingly bright and
increasingly near.

644
00:53:48,301 --> 00:53:50,800
As this star approaches us...

645
00:53:51,801 --> 00:53:53,900
Jim Stark.

646
00:53:54,501 --> 00:53:58,400
- I'll go find a place. I'm sorry.
- As this star approaches us,

647
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,700
the weather will change.

648
00:53:59,951 --> 00:54:02,600
The great polar fields
of the north and south

649
00:54:02,601 --> 00:54:06,900
will rot and divide. And
the seas will turn warmer.

650
00:54:07,401 --> 00:54:10,300
The last of us search the
heavens and stand amazed.

651
00:54:10,601 --> 00:54:12,990
For the stars will
still be there...

652
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:14,700
moving through their...

653
00:54:31,033 --> 00:54:32,560
I have an idea.

654
00:59:07,806 --> 00:59:09,898
What is that? Is that a script?

655
00:59:09,899 --> 00:59:11,963
- It's a play.
- A play?

656
00:59:12,323 --> 00:59:14,237
You better give us all roles.

657
00:59:14,238 --> 00:59:16,009
Actually, it's a one woman show.

658
00:59:16,603 --> 00:59:17,924
So I can't.

659
00:59:23,421 --> 00:59:25,458
Wow. Is that gonna
happen every time?

660
00:59:25,718 --> 00:59:27,110
I think so.

661
00:59:42,448 --> 00:59:44,166
Wait. It's one way.

662
01:02:21,792 --> 01:02:23,005
Sebastian.

663
01:02:26,814 --> 01:02:29,465
- Keith.
- Come here, man.

664
01:02:31,262 --> 01:02:32,988
- How are you?
- Very good, man.

665
01:02:32,989 --> 01:02:35,122
This is Mia. Mia, Keith.

666
01:02:35,182 --> 01:02:37,186
- Hi Mia. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

667
01:02:37,187 --> 01:02:38,485
I used to play with this guy.

668
01:02:38,754 --> 01:02:40,191
We went to school together.

669
01:02:40,485 --> 01:02:42,359
- So how you been brother?
- Great.

670
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,901
Never been better. How about you?

671
01:02:43,902 --> 01:02:45,575
I've been really good.
Been very busy.

672
01:02:45,576 --> 01:02:47,265
- I got a new combo.
- Okay.

673
01:02:47,475 --> 01:02:48,475
Cool.

674
01:02:48,476 --> 01:02:49,834
We're looking for keys.

675
01:02:51,042 --> 01:02:53,116
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not kidding.

676
01:02:53,676 --> 01:02:55,957
- No, I'm good.
- You sure? It pays.

677
01:02:57,042 --> 01:02:58,082
I'm good.

678
01:02:58,375 --> 01:02:59,975
Let's just grab a drink then.

679
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:00,976
It's been too long.

680
01:03:00,977 --> 01:03:03,255
- Okay. Nice to meet you Mia.
- Nice to meet you.

681
01:03:13,413 --> 01:03:14,896
The end.

682
01:03:16,741 --> 01:03:18,406
It's...

683
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:20,845
Genius.

684
01:03:21,574 --> 01:03:23,437
- Really?
- Yes.

685
01:03:23,438 --> 01:03:25,039
It feels really nostalgic to me.

686
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,407
- That's the point.
- Is it too nostalgic?

687
01:03:26,408 --> 01:03:27,968
- That's...
- Are people gonna like it?

688
01:03:28,777 --> 01:03:29,817
Fuck them.

689
01:03:30,492 --> 01:03:33,437
- You always say that.
- Well, I truly believe that.

690
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,984
- I made you something.
- For what?

691
01:03:36,468 --> 01:03:37,962
For your club.

692
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:41,536
Why does it say "Seb's"?

693
01:03:41,537 --> 01:03:42,971
Because I think you
should call it "Seb's".

694
01:03:42,972 --> 01:03:43,972
What?

695
01:03:43,973 --> 01:03:45,761
Because no one's gonna come
to "Chicken on a Stick".

696
01:03:45,762 --> 01:03:47,255
Is that a music note?
Is it an apostrophe?

697
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:48,256
Yes.

698
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:50,279
That's pretty cool. It's got to
be "Chicken on a Stick".

699
01:03:50,771 --> 01:03:53,425
Because Charlie Parker
got his nickname...

700
01:03:53,426 --> 01:03:54,842
I know because he loves chicken.

701
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:57,814
That's why they call him "Bird".

702
01:03:58,591 --> 01:04:01,571
So I'm gonna have chicken, beer,
jazz. "Chicken on a Stick"

703
01:04:01,572 --> 01:04:03,233
I know. I think you
should drop the chicken,

704
01:04:03,234 --> 01:04:04,528
and just have drinks
and jazz, and...

705
01:04:04,772 --> 01:04:06,606
- also there could be...
- I'm not dropping the chicken.

706
01:04:06,607 --> 01:04:07,841
You could maybe do
it somewhere else.

707
01:04:07,958 --> 01:04:09,719
Find a new spot?

708
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:10,833
It's got to be the Van Beek.

709
01:04:10,834 --> 01:04:12,329
It doesn't have to
be the Van Beek.

710
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:14,908
I can't let them samba
all over its history.

711
01:04:15,194 --> 01:04:16,234
I can't do it.

712
01:04:16,824 --> 01:04:19,271
You can let them
but you refuse to.

713
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:20,946
Your play's incredible.

714
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:25,196
You know? The whole world
from your bedroom.

715
01:04:26,065 --> 01:04:29,259
What else do they want?
Who's doing that?

716
01:04:30,162 --> 01:04:32,165
- I'm doing that.
- You're doing that.

717
01:04:33,299 --> 01:04:34,859
Who was that guy
in The Lighthouse?

718
01:04:36,478 --> 01:04:37,977
The guy that offered you the gig?

719
01:04:37,978 --> 01:04:38,978
Keith.

720
01:04:38,979 --> 01:04:40,691
Yeah. Why was it so
weird between you two?

721
01:04:40,692 --> 01:04:43,134
It's just always weird with him.

722
01:04:43,135 --> 01:04:44,545
- Really?
- Yeah.

723
01:04:44,546 --> 01:04:47,708
But he seemed kinda nice because
he did offer you a job.

724
01:04:48,773 --> 01:04:49,813
Are you gonna call him?

725
01:04:50,006 --> 01:04:54,121
- No. No.
- All right.

726
01:04:55,002 --> 01:04:56,427
So...

727
01:04:57,344 --> 01:04:59,140
- Here's what we know.
- Yeah.

728
01:05:00,188 --> 01:05:02,948
It's definitely
"Chicken on a Stick"

729
01:05:02,949 --> 01:05:05,633
and your play's
gonna be a triumph.

730
01:05:08,761 --> 01:05:10,348
It's a one woman show.

731
01:05:10,349 --> 01:05:11,349
So it's just me.

732
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:13,204
No, I mean I'm acting in it.

733
01:05:15,285 --> 01:05:19,032
No, Mum, I'm not getting
paid. I'm paying to do it.

734
01:05:21,138 --> 01:05:23,290
He's great. He's gonna
open his own jazz

735
01:05:23,291 --> 01:05:25,284
club. Yeah, it's
gonna be incredible.

736
01:05:28,331 --> 01:05:30,933
No. He's... he's
nobody yet. He needs

737
01:05:35,319 --> 01:05:36,961
He's saving up, I think.

738
01:05:43,218 --> 01:05:45,099
No but he doesn't
have a steady gig.

739
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:46,880
But he's... he's
figuring it out. It's

740
01:05:46,881 --> 01:05:48,568
just been a little
too Gilly lately.

741
01:05:52,082 --> 01:05:55,469
Mum, he's gonna find a way to open
it and you're gonna love it. Okay?

742
01:05:55,470 --> 01:05:56,510
How's Dad?

743
01:06:04,545 --> 01:06:07,629
Sebastian. Come on in, man.

744
01:06:09,309 --> 01:06:11,462
- Thanks for coming.
- Thanks for having me.

745
01:06:11,463 --> 01:06:12,597
I wasn't sure I'd see you today.

746
01:06:13,577 --> 01:06:15,921
- So here's the deal.
- Okay.

747
01:06:15,922 --> 01:06:18,580
We got distribution with
Universal. We got our own imprint.

748
01:06:18,638 --> 01:06:20,055
We're about to go on the road.

749
01:06:20,754 --> 01:06:22,236
We can pay you a
thousand bucks a week...

750
01:06:22,237 --> 01:06:26,163
plus a cut of the ticket revenue
and merchandising. Sound good?

751
01:06:29,592 --> 01:06:30,632
- Sebastian?
- Yup.

752
01:06:30,654 --> 01:06:31,694
All right.

753
01:06:32,142 --> 01:06:33,722
- Let's play.
- Okay.

754
01:06:54,713 --> 01:06:59,713
(scatting)

755
01:07:02,071 --> 01:07:04,071
(scatting)

756
01:07:13,849 --> 01:07:18,849
(scatting)

757
01:07:30,354 --> 01:07:32,930
I know. It's different.

758
01:07:35,455 --> 01:07:37,027
But you say you want to save jazz.

759
01:07:37,713 --> 01:07:39,999
How are you gonna save jazz
if no one's listening?

760
01:07:40,430 --> 01:07:42,650
Jazz is dying because
of people like you.

761
01:07:42,855 --> 01:07:46,530
You play into 90 year
old at The Lighthouse.

762
01:07:47,204 --> 01:07:49,159
Where are the kids? Where
are the young people?

763
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:53,963
You're so obsessed with Kenny
Clarke and Thelonious Monk.

764
01:07:54,147 --> 01:07:55,933
These guys were revolutionaries.

765
01:07:56,196 --> 01:07:58,167
How are you going to
be a revolutionary,

766
01:07:58,168 --> 01:07:59,754
if you're such a traditionalist?

767
01:08:00,169 --> 01:08:03,907
You holding on to the past,
but jazz is about the future.

768
01:08:08,908 --> 01:08:13,922
I know. The other guy, he
wasn't as good as you.

769
01:08:15,223 --> 01:08:17,898

I'm not sure where you are
right now. I think Boston.

831
01:16:43,359 --> 01:16:45,699
Maybe Dallas, I don't know.

832
01:16:47,767 --> 01:16:50,026
I haven't heard from you
in a little while...

833
01:16:51,725 --> 01:16:53,297
And I miss you.

834
01:16:55,419 --> 01:16:56,628
All right bye.

835
01:17:33,164 --> 01:17:34,204
I thought...

836
01:17:35,731 --> 01:17:36,848
Surprise.

837
01:17:39,562 --> 01:17:40,982
I got to leave first thing in the

838
01:17:40,983 --> 01:17:42,845
morning, but I just...
I had to see you.

839
01:17:48,193 --> 01:17:49,740
It's so nice to be home.

840
01:17:52,775 --> 01:17:54,162
I'm so glad you're home.

841
01:17:56,951 --> 01:17:58,061
How's the play going?

842
01:17:59,611 --> 01:18:00,885
I'm nervous.

843
01:18:00,905 --> 01:18:02,463
You are? Why?

844
01:18:02,745 --> 01:18:04,980
Because... what if people show up?

845
01:18:04,981 --> 01:18:05,981
Pishi kaka.

846
01:18:06,676 --> 01:18:08,236
You're nervous about
what they think?

847
01:18:09,385 --> 01:18:10,482
I'm nervous to do it.

848
01:18:10,483 --> 01:18:13,696
I'm nervous to get up on that
stage and perform for people.

849
01:18:13,697 --> 01:18:15,058
I mean, I don't need
to say that to you.

850
01:18:15,165 --> 01:18:16,532
It's gonna be incredible.

851
01:18:16,533 --> 01:18:18,507
You don't get it
but I'm terrified.

852
01:18:18,720 --> 01:18:22,342
They should be lucky to
see it. I can't wait.

853
01:18:22,861 --> 01:18:23,930
I can.

854
01:18:26,624 --> 01:18:27,845
When do you leave? In the morning?

855
01:18:28,757 --> 01:18:32,261
Yeah. 6:45. Boise.

856
01:18:33,317 --> 01:18:35,104
- Boise?
- Boise.

857
01:18:35,575 --> 01:18:36,615
To Boise.

858
01:18:39,925 --> 01:18:40,965
You should come.

859
01:18:42,685 --> 01:18:43,685
To Boise?

860
01:18:43,686 --> 01:18:45,940
Yeah. You can knock it
off your bucket list.

861
01:18:45,941 --> 01:18:49,652
Oh. That would be really
exciting. I wish I could.

862
01:18:49,753 --> 01:18:51,073
What are you doing after the tour?

863
01:18:52,429 --> 01:18:53,497
Why can't you?

864
01:18:53,935 --> 01:18:55,215
- Come to Boise?
- Yeah.

865
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:56,323
Because I have to rehearse.

866
01:18:56,907 --> 01:18:58,315
Yeah but can't you
rehearse anywhere?

867
01:19:02,427 --> 01:19:03,667
Anywhere you are?

868
01:19:04,726 --> 01:19:06,612
I mean... I guess.

869
01:19:08,867 --> 01:19:10,574
Well, all my stuff is here

870
01:19:10,575 --> 01:19:11,710
and it's in two weeks. So I don't

871
01:19:11,711 --> 01:19:12,982
think really think
that would be...

872
01:19:13,934 --> 01:19:14,934
Okay.

873
01:19:14,935 --> 01:19:17,615
- The best idea right now, but...
- Right.

874
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:19,520
I wish I could.

875
01:19:20,785 --> 01:19:22,312
We're just gonna have
to try and see each

876
01:19:22,313 --> 01:19:23,912
other, you know, so
that we see each other.

877
01:19:23,913 --> 01:19:25,451
I know but when are you done?

878
01:19:26,641 --> 01:19:27,819
What do you mean? I mean...

879
01:19:29,525 --> 01:19:30,870
When you're finish
with the whole tour?

880
01:19:31,492 --> 01:19:33,030
After we finish, we're gonna go to

881
01:19:33,031 --> 01:19:34,975
recording and then
we'll go back on tour.

882
01:19:35,716 --> 01:19:37,507
You know, we tour so we
can make the records

883
01:19:37,508 --> 01:19:39,020
so we can go back
to tour the record.

884
01:19:43,325 --> 01:19:44,898
So it's like the long haul?

885
01:19:48,764 --> 01:19:49,988
What do you mean the "long haul"?

886
01:19:50,537 --> 01:19:52,829
I mean the long haul
that you're gonna

887
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:54,886
stay in this band for a long time.

888
01:19:56,146 --> 01:19:57,490
On tour.

889
01:19:59,466 --> 01:20:01,414
I mean, what did you
think I was going to do?

890
01:20:01,415 --> 01:20:02,764
I don't...

891
01:20:02,765 --> 01:20:04,275
I hadn't really
thought it through.

892
01:20:04,276 --> 01:20:05,376
I didn't know that the band...

893
01:20:06,275 --> 01:20:08,875
Would be important. You didn't
think we would be successful.

894
01:20:13,146 --> 01:20:15,909
No, that's not really what I
mean. I just mean that you...

895
01:20:15,910 --> 01:20:19,667
I mean... You'll be on tour
for what? Months now? Years?

896
01:20:19,727 --> 01:20:21,320
Yeah I don't mean... this is it...

897
01:20:21,321 --> 01:20:23,183
I mean, this is... it
could feasibly be...

898
01:20:23,184 --> 01:20:25,089
yeah for... I could be
on tour with this...

899
01:20:25,090 --> 01:20:27,527
For a couple of years at
least, just this record.

900
01:20:29,005 --> 01:20:31,052
Do you like the music
you're playing?

901
01:20:33,387 --> 01:20:34,783
I don't...

902
01:20:35,126 --> 01:20:38,544
I don't know... what...
what it matters.

903
01:20:38,838 --> 01:20:40,758
Well, it matters because...

904
01:20:40,759 --> 01:20:43,120
if you're going to give
up your dream. I think

905
01:20:43,121 --> 01:20:45,380
it matters that you like
what you're playing

906
01:20:45,381 --> 01:20:47,244
on the road for years.

907
01:20:49,697 --> 01:20:51,351
Do you like the music that I play?

908
01:20:51,352 --> 01:20:52,522
Yeah.

909
01:20:54,349 --> 01:20:55,493
I do.

910
01:20:55,494 --> 01:20:57,226
I just didn't think that you did.

911
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:58,320
Yeah well...

912
01:20:58,321 --> 01:21:00,065
You know, you said
Keith is the worst

913
01:21:00,066 --> 01:21:01,598
And now you're gonna
be on tour with

914
01:21:01,599 --> 01:21:02,737
him for years, so I just didn't...

915
01:21:02,738 --> 01:21:04,419
I don't know what... What
are you doing right now?

916
01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:06,089
- Know if you were happy.
- Why are you doing this?

917
01:21:06,090 --> 01:21:07,846
I don't... What do you mean
"why are you doing this"?

918
01:21:07,847 --> 01:21:09,021
I thought you wanted me to do this

919
01:21:09,022 --> 01:21:10,822
and it just sounds like now
you don't want me to do it.

920
01:21:10,823 --> 01:21:12,701
What do you mean I
wanted you to do this?

921
01:21:12,827 --> 01:21:14,197
This is what you wanted for me.

922
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,164
To be in this band?

923
01:21:16,165 --> 01:21:18,848
To be in a band to
have a steady job.

924
01:21:18,849 --> 01:21:21,319
You know, to... to be... you know.

925
01:21:22,488 --> 01:21:24,498
Of course, I wanted you
to have a steady job...

926
01:21:24,597 --> 01:21:26,217
so that you can take
care of yourself and

927
01:21:26,218 --> 01:21:27,799
your life and you could
start your club.

928
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,328
Yes so I'm doing that so
I don't understand...

929
01:21:29,329 --> 01:21:30,434
I mean why aren't we celebrating?

930
01:21:30,435 --> 01:21:31,941
Why aren't you starting your club?

931
01:21:32,156 --> 01:21:34,606
You said yourself no one
wants to go to that club.

932
01:21:34,866 --> 01:21:36,894
No one wants to go to a club
called "Chicken on a Stick".

933
01:21:36,895 --> 01:21:37,935
So change the name.

934
01:21:38,054 --> 01:21:40,187
Well, no one likes
jazz. Not even you.

935
01:21:40,213 --> 01:21:42,112
I do like jazz now because of you.

936
01:21:42,113 --> 01:21:44,027
And this is what I thought
you wanted me to do.

937
01:21:44,779 --> 01:21:47,961
What am I supposed to do? Go
back to playing Jingle Bells?

938
01:21:47,962 --> 01:21:50,507
I'm not saying that. I'm
saying why don't you take...

939
01:21:50,563 --> 01:21:52,330
what you've made and
start the club...

940
01:21:52,331 --> 01:21:54,250
that people will wanna go to it...

941
01:21:54,306 --> 01:21:56,060
because you're
passionate about it...

942
01:21:56,061 --> 01:21:58,224
and people love what other
people are passionate about.

943
01:21:58,225 --> 01:21:59,773
You remind people of
what they've forgotten.

944
01:21:59,774 --> 01:22:00,865
Not in my experience.

945
01:22:04,485 --> 01:22:07,955
Well, whatever alright. It's...
it's time to grow up, you know.

946
01:22:07,956 --> 01:22:10,174
I have a steady job,
this is what I'm doing.

947
01:22:10,408 --> 01:22:12,135
And now all of a sudden if
you had these problems,

948
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:13,886
I wish you would've
said them earlier...

949
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:15,765
before I signed on the
goddamn dotted line.

950
01:22:15,766 --> 01:22:18,606
I'm pointing out that you had a
dream that you followed, that...

951
01:22:18,607 --> 01:22:19,607
you were sticking...

952
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:21,455
This is the dream.
This is the dream.

953
01:22:21,456 --> 01:22:22,973
- This is not your dream.
- Guys like me...

954
01:22:23,024 --> 01:22:25,666
work their whole lives to be in
something that's successful,

955
01:22:25,667 --> 01:22:27,874
that people like. You know?

956
01:22:27,889 --> 01:22:32,003
I mean, I'm finally in
something that people enjoy.

957
01:22:32,004 --> 01:22:33,476
Since when do you care
about being liked?

958
01:22:33,477 --> 01:22:35,215
Just because I don't enjoy
it, it doesn't matter.

959
01:22:35,216 --> 01:22:36,989
Why do you care so much
you about being liked?

960
01:22:36,990 --> 01:22:39,338
You are an actress. What
are you talking about?

961
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:59,003
Maybe you just liked me
when I was on my ass...

962
01:22:59,004 --> 01:23:01,161
because it made you feel
better about yourself

963
01:23:05,771 --> 01:23:07,616
- Are you kidding?
- No.

964
01:23:29,217 --> 01:23:30,346
I don't know...

965
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:53,069
Okay fellas. I'll...
see you tomorrow.

966
01:24:53,070 --> 01:24:54,277
- Sebastian?
- Yeah?

967
01:24:54,328 --> 01:24:55,568
You're good for tonight, right?

968
01:24:57,488 --> 01:24:59,809
- What are you talking about?
- At 7, the photo shoot.

969
01:25:01,335 --> 01:25:03,031
For Mojo. You good?

970
01:25:06,369 --> 01:25:08,410
I thought that was next Thursday.

971
01:25:08,411 --> 01:25:09,544
No, it's tonight.

972
01:25:12,335 --> 01:25:13,415
Is that okay?

973
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:12,123
- Tonya, give me the other camera.
- What's wrong with that?

974
01:26:12,156 --> 01:26:13,621
"What's wrong with that"?
Oh I don't know...

975
01:26:13,622 --> 01:26:15,551
It does not bloody work.
That's what's wrong with it.

976
01:26:15,610 --> 01:26:17,225
Alright trumpet, that's lovely.

977
01:26:18,848 --> 01:26:21,103
Lovely. Beautiful. Beautiful.

978
01:26:21,927 --> 01:26:24,599
Okay, keyboard. Okay,
look up. That's

979
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:26,990
good. That's good. That's lovely.

980
01:26:26,991 --> 01:26:31,189
Wonderful. Okay, cut the music.
That is lovely. That's lovely.

981
01:26:31,244 --> 01:26:35,179
Okay, now look. Now bite
your lip like this...

982
01:26:35,226 --> 01:26:37,380
like you're concentrating
on something, I

983
01:26:37,381 --> 01:26:39,432
don't know, like a
piece of your music.

984
01:26:39,433 --> 01:26:41,994
- Bite my what?
- Your lip. Bite your lip.

985
01:26:44,655 --> 01:26:46,791
That's good. That's
great. Beautiful.

986
01:26:46,805 --> 01:26:47,805
Beautiful.

987
01:26:47,806 --> 01:26:51,510
Okay. Now, just move your
glasses down on your nose.

988
01:26:51,511 --> 01:26:53,886
A little bit further. Just a
little bit touch further.

989
01:26:53,887 --> 01:26:57,321
Keep your head down, but look
up at me. Look sort of moody.

990
01:26:57,726 --> 01:27:00,291
Yeah. That is beautiful.
That is great.

991
01:27:00,292 --> 01:27:02,600
Okay, turn on the
keyboard on live.

992
01:27:03,595 --> 01:27:04,968
You want to hear the keyboard?

993
01:27:04,969 --> 01:27:06,855
No. You don't have to
bite your lip now.

994
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:09,330
Well, you should play something.

995
01:27:10,297 --> 01:27:12,272
Play something, you
know. Anything.

996
01:27:12,537 --> 01:27:13,971
You're pianist, aren't
you? Play something.

997
01:27:27,486 --> 01:27:31,223
That's great. That's beautiful.
That's lovely. Oh, that's good.

998
01:27:31,224 --> 01:27:32,746
Now, don't stop. Keep playing.

999
01:27:33,217 --> 01:27:35,779
Come on, just keep
playing. That was great.

1000
01:28:15,415 --> 01:28:16,993
Shoot myself in the head.

1001
01:28:18,970 --> 01:28:22,051
She's not even good. And
the window thing...

1002
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:23,853
- What was that?
- Yes.

1003
01:28:23,854 --> 01:28:25,291
What did she do with the window?

1004
01:28:25,292 --> 01:28:27,292
Oh my God. Don't
quit your day job.

1005
01:28:27,761 --> 01:28:28,801
Oh well...

1006
01:28:55,941 --> 01:28:57,040
Mia.

1007
01:28:59,062 --> 01:29:01,736
Mia. I'm so sorry.

1008
01:29:04,451 --> 01:29:06,923
Just tell me how it
went? How was it?

1009
01:29:06,924 --> 01:29:08,420
I'm sorry.

1010
01:29:09,106 --> 01:29:10,937
I'm sorry I missed your play.
I'm sorry I didn't come.

1011
01:29:10,938 --> 01:29:12,038
You're sorry. You're sorry.

1012
01:29:12,039 --> 01:29:13,079
You're sorry.

1013
01:29:13,444 --> 01:29:15,935
- You're sorry.
- Let me make it up to you.

1014
01:29:16,977 --> 01:29:18,601
Let me make it up to you. Okay?

1015
01:29:24,980 --> 01:29:26,502
- I don't blame you if...
- It's over.

1016
01:29:28,126 --> 01:29:29,931
- What is?
- It's over.

1017
01:29:30,419 --> 01:29:31,459
What?

1018
01:29:33,471 --> 01:29:34,511
All of this.

1019
01:29:35,104 --> 01:29:38,588
I'm done embarrassing
myself. I'm done. I'm done.

1020
01:29:39,621 --> 01:29:41,007
- Nobody showed up.
- So what?

1021
01:29:41,128 --> 01:29:43,094
I can't pay back the
theatre. This is so...

1022
01:29:45,394 --> 01:29:46,606
I'm gonna go home for a while.

1023
01:29:47,276 --> 01:29:49,961
- I'll come see you tomorrow.
- No, I'm going "home" home.

1024
01:29:51,082 --> 01:29:53,368
- This is home.
- No, it's not any more.

1025
01:32:08,853 --> 01:32:09,934
Yep?

1026
01:32:09,935 --> 01:32:11,775
Hi. I'm trying to
reach a Mia Dolan.

1027
01:32:13,133 --> 01:32:14,303
Wrong number.

1028
01:32:14,304 --> 01:32:15,547
Yeah, she said if she's not on her

1029
01:32:15,548 --> 01:32:16,972
cell, I'm told I
might find her here.

1030
01:32:16,973 --> 01:32:17,973
Not any more.

1031
01:32:18,321 --> 01:32:19,799
Okay well, if you
do talk to her...

1032
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:20,800
I won't.

1033
01:32:20,801 --> 01:32:22,230
Could you tell her
Jane and Amy Brandt

1034
01:32:22,231 --> 01:32:23,557
casting is trying to reach her.

1035
01:32:29,866 --> 01:32:30,906
Casting?

1036
01:32:39,379 --> 01:32:40,845
What the hell is that?

1037
01:32:46,234 --> 01:32:47,777
Stop that fucking noise.

1038
01:32:58,436 --> 01:32:59,781
Why did you come here?

1039
01:32:59,782 --> 01:33:01,479
Because I have good news.

1040
01:33:01,772 --> 01:33:02,812
What?

1041
01:33:03,142 --> 01:33:05,911
Amy Brandt, the casting director.

1042
01:33:05,912 --> 01:33:06,934
Yeah?

1043
01:33:06,935 --> 01:33:09,601
She was at your play
and she loved it.

1044
01:33:10,056 --> 01:33:12,437
And she loved it so
much that she wants you

1045
01:33:12,438 --> 01:33:14,873
to come in tomorrow and
audition for this...

1046
01:33:14,874 --> 01:33:16,641
huge movie that she's got.

1047
01:33:18,291 --> 01:33:19,418
I'm not going to that.

1048
01:33:22,092 --> 01:33:23,160
I'm not going to that.

1049
01:33:23,161 --> 01:33:24,161
What?

1050
01:33:24,162 --> 01:33:25,962
That one's gonna be... No.
That one's gonna be...

1051
01:33:26,121 --> 01:33:27,121
I'm sorry?

1052
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:28,985
That will kill me.

1053
01:33:30,645 --> 01:33:31,985
- What?
- What?

1054
01:33:32,332 --> 01:33:34,154
- What? Stop.
- No.

1055
01:33:34,350 --> 01:33:36,149
- You have to be quiet.
- If you want me to be quiet.

1056
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:37,397
You're gonna wake
up the neighbours.

1057
01:33:37,398 --> 01:33:38,398
You have to make sense.

1058
01:33:38,399 --> 01:33:39,545
If you want me to be quiet, you're

1059
01:33:39,547 --> 01:33:40,792
gonna have make
some goddamn sense.

1060
01:33:40,793 --> 01:33:42,491
They're gonna call, they're
gonna call the police.

1061
01:33:42,492 --> 01:33:43,499
Because... because...

1062
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:44,846
I've been to a million
of auditions and

1063
01:33:44,847 --> 01:33:45,999
the same thing happens every time.

1064
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,141
Where I get interrupted because
someone wants to get a sandwich.

1065
01:33:48,155 --> 01:33:50,816
Or I'm crying and
they start laughing.

1066
01:33:50,871 --> 01:33:52,638
Or there's people
sitting in the waiting

1067
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:54,017
room and they're and they're...

1068
01:33:54,018 --> 01:33:56,603
like me but prettier
and better at the...

1069
01:33:56,604 --> 01:33:58,758
because maybe I'm not good enough.

1070
01:33:58,763 --> 01:34:00,443
- Yes, you are.
- No.

1071
01:34:01,368 --> 01:34:05,289
- Maybe I'm not.
- You are.

1072
01:34:08,116 --> 01:34:12,045
Maybe I'm one of those people
who always wanted to do it...

1073
01:34:12,084 --> 01:34:15,345
but it's like a pipe
dream for me, you know?

1074
01:34:16,056 --> 01:34:19,415
You said it: You change your
dreams and then you grow up.

1075
01:34:19,416 --> 01:34:21,963
Maybe I'm one of those people
and I'm not supposed to.

1076
01:34:21,991 --> 01:34:24,087
And I can go back
to school and find

1077
01:34:24,088 --> 01:34:26,353
something else that
I'm supposed to do.

1078
01:34:26,419 --> 01:34:29,311
Because I left to do that...

1079
01:34:29,312 --> 01:34:31,838
and it's been six years and I
don't wanna do it any more.

1080
01:34:35,555 --> 01:34:36,756
Why?

1081
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Why what?

1082
01:34:40,001 --> 01:34:41,974
Why don't you wanna
do it any more?

1083
01:34:44,151 --> 01:34:46,741
Because I think it hurts
a little bit too much.

1084
01:34:48,932 --> 01:34:50,082
You're a baby.

1085
01:34:51,580 --> 01:34:53,054
I'm not a baby. I'm
trying to grow up.

1086
01:34:53,055 --> 01:34:54,421
You are. You're
crying like a baby.

1087
01:34:54,422 --> 01:34:55,422
Oh my God.

1088
01:34:55,423 --> 01:34:57,082
And you have an audition
tomorrow at 5:30.

1089
01:34:58,184 --> 01:34:59,820
I'll be out front at 8:00 am.

1090
01:35:00,942 --> 01:35:03,382
You'll be out front
or not. I don't know.

1091
01:35:04,828 --> 01:35:06,198
How did you find me here?

1092
01:35:07,530 --> 01:35:09,398
The house in front of the library.

1093
01:35:52,966 --> 01:35:54,543
- I got coffee.
- Okay, great.

1094
01:36:13,170 --> 01:36:14,210
Mia?

1095
01:36:20,023 --> 01:36:22,803
Hi, Mia. I'm Amy
and this is Frank.

1096
01:36:22,804 --> 01:36:24,644
- Hi, how are you?
- Pleasure to meet you.

1097
01:36:24,744 --> 01:36:27,250
- I'm glad we found you.
- Me too.

1098
01:36:28,733 --> 01:36:32,463
The film shoots in Paris and
we don't have a script.

1099
01:36:34,233 --> 01:36:36,003
It's gonna be a
process. We're gonna

1100
01:36:36,004 --> 01:36:37,916
build the character
around the actress.

1101
01:36:37,917 --> 01:36:39,946
It's a three-month rehearsal
and a four-month shoot.

1102
01:36:42,442 --> 01:36:43,482
Okay.

1103
01:36:44,463 --> 01:36:47,768
And we thought you could
just tell us a story.

1104
01:36:47,999 --> 01:36:50,893
- About?
- Just tell us anything.

1105
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:52,800
Anything?

1106
01:36:52,801 --> 01:36:55,518
Yes. Tell us a story.
You're a storyteller.

1107
01:37:01,079 --> 01:37:02,160
Whenever you're ready.

1108
01:37:12,807 --> 01:37:14,892
My aunt used to live in Paris.

1109
01:37:20,082 --> 01:37:22,423
I remember, she used to come
home and she would tell us...

1110
01:37:23,342 --> 01:37:26,744
These stories about
being abroad and...

1111
01:37:28,987 --> 01:37:34,288
I remember she told us that she
jumped into the river once...

1112
01:37:36,723 --> 01:37:37,763
Barefoot.

1113
01:37:39,858 --> 01:37:41,142

They said the next couple of days.

1151
01:41:23,112 --> 01:41:25,860
But I'm not expecting
to find anything out.

1152
01:41:25,865 --> 01:41:27,864
- You're gonna get it.
- I really might not.

1153
01:41:27,865 --> 01:41:29,499
- Yes, you are.
- I don't want to be disappointed.

1154
01:41:29,504 --> 01:41:30,544
I know.

1155
01:41:30,949 --> 01:41:33,443
I know. I know these things.

1156
01:41:36,350 --> 01:41:37,390
Where we are?

1157
01:41:40,726 --> 01:41:41,726
Griffith Park.

1158
01:41:41,727 --> 01:41:44,474
- Where are we?
- I know.

1159
01:41:46,951 --> 01:41:48,061
I don't know.

1160
01:41:51,223 --> 01:41:52,396
What do we do?

1161
01:41:53,698 --> 01:41:56,093
I don't think we
could do anything,

1162
01:41:56,094 --> 01:41:58,022
because when you get this...

1163
01:41:58,222 --> 01:42:00,321
- If I get this.
- When you get this...

1164
01:42:02,561 --> 01:42:04,342
You got to give it
everything you got.

1165
01:42:06,349 --> 01:42:09,559
Everything. It's your dream.

1166
01:42:09,928 --> 01:42:11,263
What are you gonna do?

1167
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,371
I got to follow my
own plan. You know?

1168
01:42:14,372 --> 01:42:16,742
Stay here and get
my own thing going.

1169
01:42:22,334 --> 01:42:25,523
You'll be in Paris.
Good jazz there.

1170
01:42:26,535 --> 01:42:28,238
And you love jazz now.

1171
01:42:30,287 --> 01:42:31,327
Right?

1172
01:42:32,987 --> 01:42:34,059
Yes.

1173
01:42:43,774 --> 01:42:46,059
I guess we're just gonna
have to wait and see.

1174
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:56,870
I'll always gonna love you.

1175
01:42:58,654 --> 01:43:00,318
I'll always gonna love you too.

1176
01:43:08,313 --> 01:43:09,812
Look at this view.

1177
01:43:11,978 --> 01:43:12,978
I've seen better.

1178
01:43:12,979 --> 01:43:14,122
- It's the worst.
- Yeah.

1179
01:43:14,123 --> 01:43:15,198
Yeah.

1180
01:43:18,722 --> 01:43:20,497
I've never been here
during the day.

1181
01:44:13,265 --> 01:44:15,118
Hi. Can I have two
iced coffees, please.

1182
01:44:15,119 --> 01:44:16,180
Right. Of course.

1183
01:44:16,181 --> 01:44:19,307
- On us.
- Oh, no thank you. I insist.

1184
01:44:49,357 --> 01:44:52,877
Sounds good. Harris
did a good job.

1185
01:44:53,538 --> 01:44:57,504
- It took him long enough.
- He always does. Signature time.

1186
01:44:59,958 --> 01:45:01,787
It's not doing too bad, Seb.

1187
01:45:01,857 --> 01:45:03,482
"Not too bad" is great.

1188
01:45:03,739 --> 01:45:05,699
- See you tonight.
- See you tonight.

1189
01:45:26,740 --> 01:45:27,780
Hi.

1190
01:45:28,245 --> 01:45:30,084
- How was your day?
- Good.

1191
01:45:34,810 --> 01:45:36,274
- How is she?
- She's great.

1192
01:45:36,297 --> 01:45:37,337
- Yeah?
- Yeah, come on.

1193
01:45:38,199 --> 01:45:39,286
Hi Myke.

1194
01:45:40,716 --> 01:45:42,850
I didn't think you were
gonna be home yet.

1195
01:45:44,538 --> 01:45:46,794
- Are you drawing?
- Yeah.

1196
01:45:46,795 --> 01:45:49,991
Can I help? You know
I love to draw.

1197
01:46:29,469 --> 01:46:32,429
Okay Chelsea, we're
gonna go. Are you good?

1198
01:46:32,430 --> 01:46:33,749
- We're good.
- You need anything?

1199
01:46:34,530 --> 01:46:36,112
Bye baby.

1200
01:46:36,681 --> 01:46:38,075
- Say "Bye bye, Mummy."
- Sleep well.

1201
01:46:38,076 --> 01:46:40,725
- Bye, Mummy.
- Have fun with Chelsea.

1202
01:46:40,726 --> 01:46:43,375
- Have fun. Bye, Mia.
- Bye. Thank you so much.

Oh boy.

1205
01:46:57,998 --> 01:47:00,444
What if we miss this? What
do you wanna tell Natalie?

1206
01:47:01,797 --> 01:47:03,548
Maybe we'll just see
her back in New York.

Okay.

1208
01:47:06,822 --> 01:47:09,599

- It is bad.

1209
01:47:16,307 --> 01:47:18,227
Do you just wanna pull off
here and go to dinner?

1210
01:47:21,082 --> 01:47:23,723
- Sure yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay.

1211
01:47:52,598 --> 01:47:53,763

01:58:31,231 --> 01:58:32,891
You want to stay through another?
