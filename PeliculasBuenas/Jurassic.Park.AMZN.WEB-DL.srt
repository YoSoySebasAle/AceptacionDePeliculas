1
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,006
Everybody, heads up!
Keep it clear, now.

2
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:30,424
Keep it clear!

3
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:33,344
Stand back!

4
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,350
Bring it forward, come on!

5
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:46,690
Slow it down!

6
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:59,537
- Pushing team, move in there.
- Move in.

7
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:04,041
- On your ready.
- I want Tasers on full charge.

8
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:08,420
Steady! Go on. Step back in.

9
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:10,381
Ready. Move it.

10
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,050
And push.

11
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,518
Locked. Loading team, step away.

12
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:23,853
Move it.

13
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,487
Jophery, raise the gate.

14
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,674
Block the opening!
Don't let her get out!

15
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,685
Somebody help him!

16
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:06,729
Work her back!

17
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,575
Shoot her!

18
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:23,078
Shoot her!

19
00:03:58,072 --> 00:04:01,408
- I heard that Hammond's not even here.
- He sends his apologies.

20
00:04:01,533 --> 00:04:04,662
There's a $20 million lawsuit
by the family of that worker...

21
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,331
and you're telling me
that Hammond can't see me?

22
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,501
He had to leave early,
his daughter's getting a divorce.

23
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,629
I understand, but we need
to deal with the situation now.

24
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,881
- The insurance company....
- You okay?

25
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:22,930
The underwriters feel that the accident's
raised safety questions about the park.

26
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:25,599
That makes the investors very anxious.

27
00:04:25,683 --> 00:04:29,269
I had to promise to conduct
a very thorough, on-site inspection.

28
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,524
Hammond hates inspections.
They slow everything down.

29
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:37,277
I need to or they'll pull the funding.
That'll slow him down even more.

30
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,201
Watch your head.

31
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:49,623
If two experts sign off on
the island, the insurance guys will back off.

32
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:53,127
I already have Ian Malcolm,
but they think he's too trendy.

33
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,795
- They want Alan Grant.
- Grant?

34
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,131
You'll never get him out of Montana.

35
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,133
Why not?

36
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,344
Why not?

37
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,682
Because Grant's like me.

38
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:10,144
He's a digger.

39
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,524
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler,
we're ready to try again.

40
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,402
I hate computers.

41
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,446
The feeling's mutual.

42
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,587
Take a look.

43
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:22,716
Did it work?

44
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,886
- How long does this take?
- Should bring an immediate return.

45
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:30,057
You shoot the radar into the ground,
and the bone bounces the image back.

46
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,226
Bounces it back....

47
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:36,355
This new program is incredible.

48
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,690
A few more years'
development...

49
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:40,400
and we won't even have to dig anymore.

50
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,194
Where's the fun in that?

51
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:46,281
It's a little distorted,
but I don't think it's the computer.

52
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:50,494
Post-mortem contraction
of the posterior neck ligaments.

53
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,789
- Velociraptor?
- Yes. Good shape, too.

54
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:57,000
It's five, six feet high.
I'm guessing nine feet long.

55
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,669
- Look--
- What'd you do?

56
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,087
He touched it.

57
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:04,174
- Dr. Grant's not machine-compatible.
- Hell, they've got it in for me.

58
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,803
And look at the half-moon shaped bones
in the wrists.

59
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:10,514
It's no wonder these guys learned
how to fly.

60
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:13,684
No, seriously.

61
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:18,313
Maybe dinosaurs
have more in common...

62
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,691
with present-day birds than with reptiles.

63
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:24,278
Look at the pubic bone,
turned backward, just like a bird.

64
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:28,657
Look at the vertebrae,
full of air sacs and hollows, like a bird.

65
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:31,869
And even the word "raptor"
means "bird of prey."

66
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,204
That doesn't look very scary.

67
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:38,500
More like a 6-foot turkey.

68
00:07:41,003 --> 00:07:42,337
A turkey?

69
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,342
Imagine yourself
in the Cretaceous period.

70
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:48,468
Here we go.

71
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:52,681
You'd get your first look at
this 6-foot turkey as you enter a clearing.

72
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:56,018
He moves like a bird,
lightly bobbing his head.

73
00:07:56,059 --> 00:08:00,522
You keep still because you think maybe
his visual acuity is based on movement...

74
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:03,400
like T. Rex and he'll lose you
if you don't move.

75
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,611
But no, not Velociraptor.

76
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:10,032
You stare at him
and he just stares right back.

77
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:15,370
And that's when the attack comes.
Not from the front, but from the side.

78
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:19,750
From the other two Raptors
you didn't even know were there.

79
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:25,964
Because Velociraptor's a pack hunter.
He uses coordinated attack patterns...

80
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,467
and he is out in force today.

81
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,970
And he slashes at you with this...

82
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:36,558
a 6-inch retractable claw,
like a razor, on the middle toe.

83
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:40,687
He doesn't bother to bite your jugular
like a lion. No.

84
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:42,898
He slashes at you...

85
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,567
here or here....

86
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:47,027
Alan.

87
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:51,365
Or maybe across the belly,
spilling your intestines.

88
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:57,621
The point is, you are alive
when they start to eat you.

89
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:02,668
So, you know,
try to show a little respect.

90
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:04,586
Okay.

91
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:16,765
Alan, if you wanted to scare the kid,
you could've pulled a gun on him.

92
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:19,351
Yeah, I know. Kids.

93
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:22,187
You want to have one of those?

94
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:27,192
I don't want that kid,
but a breed of the child could be intriguing.

95
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,987
I mean, what's so wrong with kids?

96
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:34,491
They're noisy, they're messy,
they're expensive.

97
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,034
Cheap, cheap.

98
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,536
They smell.

99
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,329
- They don't smell!
- Some smell.

100
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:41,707
- Give me a break!
- Babies smell.

101
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,300
- Cover the site!
- Cover up the dig!

102
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,969
- Tell them to shut down!
- Cut the machine!

103
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:56,638
Cover it all up. Pull it over.

104
00:09:58,473 --> 00:10:02,019
Just cut it, will you? Shut it down!

105
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:03,854
What?

106
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,705
What the hell do you think
you're doing in here?

107
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:23,874
We were saving that.

108
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,835
For today, I guarantee it.

109
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:31,465
- Who in God's name do you think you are?
- John Hammond.

110
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:34,926
And I'm delighted to meet you finally
in person, Dr. Grant.

111
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:40,974
So, I can see that my $50,000 a year
has been well spent.

112
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:42,851
Who's the jerk?

113
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:46,355
- This is our paleobotanist, Dr.--
- Sattler.

114
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,774
Ellie, this is Mr. Hammond.

115
00:10:49,316 --> 00:10:52,194
I'm sorry about the dramatic entrance,
Dr. Sattler, but...

116
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,363
- Did I say "jerk"?
- ...we're in a hurry.

117
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,824
Will you have a drink?
We won't let it get warm. Sit down.

118
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:01,661
- Let me have this.
- I'll get a glass or two. I can do it.

119
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,288
There's samples everywhere.

120
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:05,040
I know my way
around the kitchen.

121
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,250
Now, I'll get right to the point.

122
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,171
I like you. Both of you.

123
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:14,841
I can tell instantly about people. It's a gift.

124
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:21,098
I own an island off the coast of Costa Rica.

125
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:25,185
I've leased it from the government
and during the last five years...

126
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,771
I've been setting up a biological preserve.

127
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,232
Really spectacular. Spared no expense.

128
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:33,777
Make the one I've got down in Kenya
look like a petting zoo.

129
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:38,031
And there's no doubt our attractions
will drive kids out of their minds.

130
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:41,535
- And what are those?
- Small versions of adults, honey.

131
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,537
And not just kids, everyone.

132
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:46,915
We're going to open next year,
if the lawyers don't kill me first.

133
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,501
I don't care for lawyers, do you?

134
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,879
- I don't really know any.
- Don't really know any.

135
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:58,051
I do, there's a particular pebble in my shoe,
who represents my investors.

136
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:01,179
Says that they insist on outside opinions.

137
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,931
What kind of opinions?

138
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,059
Well, your kind,
not to put too fine a point on it.

139
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:10,230
Let's face it, in your particular fields,
you're the top minds.

140
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,774
And if I could just persuade you...

141
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:16,403
to sign off on the park,
give it your endorsement...

142
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:20,907
maybe even pen a wee testimonial,
I could get back on schedule.

143
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:26,121
- Why would they care what we think?
- What kind of park is this?

144
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,333
It's right up your alley.

145
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,465
Why don't you come down,
just the pair of you, for the weekend?

146
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:39,676
I'd love to have an opinion
of a paleobotanist as well.

147
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:42,679
I've got a jet standing by at Choteau.

148
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,975
I'm sorry. This isn't possible.

149
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:49,478
We just dug up a new skeleton--

150
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,607
I could compensate you
by fully funding your dig...

151
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:56,693
- This is a very unusual time.
- The timing is--

152
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:59,154
...for a further three years.

153
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:05,702
Where's the plane?

154
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:08,205
- Okay.
- Three years.

155
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,539
Cheers.

156
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:52,999
Dodgson!

157
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,051
You shouldn't use my name.

158
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:06,888
Dodgson. We've got Dodgson here.

159
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:10,725
See, nobody cares. Nice hat.

160
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:14,187
What're you trying to look like,
a secret agent?

161
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:15,981
- Well?
- $750,000.

162
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:19,025
On delivery, $50,000 more
for each viable embryo.

163
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:22,153
That's $1.5 million
if you get all 15 species off the island.

164
00:14:22,237 --> 00:14:23,363
I'll get them all.

165
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:27,367
Remember, viable embryos.
They're no use to us if they don't survive.

166
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,703
How am I supposed to transport them?

167
00:14:33,456 --> 00:14:35,125
The bottom screws open.

168
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,461
That's great. Oh, my God.

169
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,047
It's cooled
and compartmentalized inside.

170
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:42,674
You guys. That's great.

171
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:44,426
Customs can check it if they want to.

172
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:46,011
- Let me see.
- Go on.

173
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:49,931
- There's enough coolant for 36 hours.
- No menthol?

174
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:53,059
The embryos have to be back here
in San José by then.

175
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:54,936
That's up to your guy on the boat.

176
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:58,690
7:00 tomorrow night on the East Dock.
Make sure he gets it right.

177
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:03,028
- How are you planning to beat security?
- I've got an 18-minute window.

178
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:07,073
Eighteen minutes and your company
catches up on 10 years of research.

179
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,204
Don't get cheap on me, Dodgson.

180
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,709
That was Hammond's mistake.

181
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:34,351
So you two dig up dinosaurs?

182
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:38,813
- Well....
- We try to.

183
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:47,739
You'll have to get used to Dr. Malcolm.

184
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:52,202
He suffers from a deplorable excess of
personality, especially for a mathematician.

185
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,204
Chaotician. Chaotician, actually.

186
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,081
John doesn't subscribe to chaos...

187
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:58,625
particularly what it says
about his science project.

188
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:02,504
Ian, you've never been able to
sufficiently explain your concerns--

189
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:05,423
Because of the behavior
of the system in phase space?

190
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:08,802
A load, if I may say so,
of fashionable number crunching--

191
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,095
Don't.

192
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,306
Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant,
you've heard of Chaos Theory?

193
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,975
- No.
- No? Non-linear equations?

194
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:18,770
Strange attractors?

195
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:25,527
I refuse to believe that you aren't familiar
with the concept of attraction.

196
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,909
I bring scientists. You bring a rock star.

197
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:38,498
There it is.

198
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:11,114
Bad wind shears. We have to drop
pretty fast. Hold on, this will be thrilling.

199
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,519
But you need that piece over here,
and that piece....

200
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:44,355
We'll have landed
by the time you get it right.

201
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:46,566
Great.

202
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:07,605
The full 50 miles of perimeter fence
are in place?

203
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:10,859
And the concrete moats,
and the motion-sensor tracking systems.

204
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:14,195
Donald, dear boy, relax.
Try and enjoy yourself.

205
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:17,365
Let's get this straight.
This is not a weekend excursion.

206
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:20,535
This is a serious investigation
of the stability of the island.

207
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:23,496
Your investors, whom I represent,
are deeply concerned.

208
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:27,000
Forty-eight hours from now,
if they're not convinced, I'm not convinced.

209
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,835
I'll shut you down, John.

210
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,464
In 48 hours, I'll be accepting your apologies.

211
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:45,268
All right, slow down. Slow. Stop!

212
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:49,188
This shouldn't be here.

213
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:11,794
Alan, this species of Veriforman
has been extinct...

214
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:14,631
since the Cretaceous Period.
I mean, this thing--

215
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:16,007
What?

216
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:46,955
Look at that.

217
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,335
It's a dinosaur.

218
00:20:56,673 --> 00:21:00,009
You did it. Crazy son of a bitch, you did it.

219
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:05,056
We could tear up the rule book
on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply.

220
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:07,517
They're wrong.
This is a warm-blooded creature.

221
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:11,270
- This thing doesn't live in a swamp.
- It's got a 25, 27-foot neck?

222
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:13,856
- The Brachiosaurus? 30.
- Thirty feet.

223
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:33,042
We're gonna make a fortune with this place.

224
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,340
How fast are they?

225
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:42,677
Well, we clocked the T. Rex
at 32 miles an hour.

226
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:45,930
T. Rex?

227
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:49,017
You said you've got a T. Rex?

228
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,185
Say again.

229
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:53,730
We have a T. Rex.

230
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,775
Put your head between your knees.

231
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,444
Dr. Grant...

232
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,863
my dear Dr. Sattler...

233
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,533
welcome to Jurassic Park.

234
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,850
They're moving in herds.

235
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:34,687
They do move in herds.

236
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:44,363
How did you do this?

237
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,534
I'll show you.

238
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:14,685
Good day.

239
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:18,106
The most advanced amusement park
in the entire world...

240
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:22,026
incorporating all the latest technologies.

241
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:25,363
And I'm not talking just about rides.
Everybody has rides.

242
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:29,700
No, we've made living
biological attractions so astounding...

243
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:33,371
that they'll capture the imagination
of the entire planet.

244
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,498
So, what are you thinking?

245
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:39,836
- That we're out of a job.
- Don't you mean "extinct"?

246
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,764
Why don't you all sit down?
Donald, sit down.

247
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:55,726
Here he comes.
Well, here I come.

248
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:01,607
Hello.

249
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:05,111
- Say hello.
- Hello.

250
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:07,405
Hello, John.

251
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,907
Yes, I've got lines.

252
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:13,452
Well, fine, I guess. But, how did I get here?

253
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:18,416
Well, let me show you.
First, I'll need a drop of blood.

254
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,251
Your blood.

255
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:21,544
Right.

256
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:24,380
That hurt.

257
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:27,925
Relax, John.
It's all part of the miracle of cloning.

258
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:30,052
Hello, John.

259
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:33,347
Cloned from what?

260
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:36,142
Loy extractions never recreated
an intact DNA strand.

261
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,311
Not without massive sequence gaps.

262
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:40,313
Paleo-DNA, from what source?

263
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,400
Where do you get 100 million-year-old
dinosaur blood?

264
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:50,448
What? What?

265
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:54,160
Well, Mr. DNA, where did you come from?

266
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:55,620
From your blood.

267
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:59,957
Just one drop of your blood
contains billions of strands of DNA...

268
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,627
the building blocks of life.

269
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:08,007
A DNA strand like me
is a blueprint for building a living thing.

270
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:13,346
And sometimes animals that went extinct
millions of years ago, like dinosaurs...

271
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:18,684
left their blueprints behind for us to find.
We just had to know where to look.

272
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:23,689
A hundred million years ago,
there were mosquitoes just like today.

273
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:27,151
And just like today,
they fed on the blood of animals.

274
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:31,989
Even dinosaurs.
Sometimes, after biting a dinosaur...

275
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:36,827
mosquitoes would land on the branch
of a tree and get stuck in the sap.

276
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:41,999
After a long time, the tree sap
would get hard and become fossilized...

277
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:47,004
just like a dinosaur bone,
preserving the mosquito inside.

278
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:51,342
This fossilized tree sap,
which we call amber...

279
00:25:51,634 --> 00:25:55,888
waited for millions of years
with the mosquito inside...

280
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:59,058
until Jurassic Park scientists came along.

281
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:04,355
Using sophisticated techniques,
they extract the preserved blood...

282
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:08,776
from the mosquito, and bingo: dino DNA!

283
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:14,115
A full DNA strand contains
three billion genetic codes.

284
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:18,828
If we looked at screens like these
once a second for eight hours a day...

285
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:22,999
it'd take two years
to look at the entire DNA strand.

286
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:27,795
It's that long.
Since it's so old, it's full of holes.

287
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:31,090
Now that's where our geneticists take over.

288
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:35,261
Thinking machine super-computers
and gene sequencers...

289
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:37,513
break down the strand in minutes.

290
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,640
And virtual-reality displays...

291
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:42,893
show our geneticists the gaps
in the DNA sequence.

292
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:45,980
We used the complete DNA of a frog...

293
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:49,984
to fill in the holes and complete the code.

294
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:54,739
Whew! And now,
we can make a baby dinosaur.

295
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:02,038
This score is only temporary.
It all has very dramatic music, of course.

296
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,166
A march or something.
It hasn't been written yet.

297
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,168
And then, the tour moves on.

298
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:21,390
Well, look here. Those
hard-working cowpokes you see behind us....

299
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:23,851
This is overwhelming, John.

300
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:28,189
Are these characters autoerotica?

301
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:30,983
No, we have no animatronics here.

302
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:34,403
Those people are the real miracle workers
of Jurassic Park.

303
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:37,698
...in unfertilized
emu or ostrich eggs.

304
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:41,494
Wait a minute.
How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?

305
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:44,246
- Can't we see the unfertilized eggs?
- Shortly.

306
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:49,293
Now a whole team
of genetic engineers goes to work on....

307
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:52,713
- Can't you stop these things?
- I'm sorry. It's kind of a ride.

308
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,799
One, two, three.

309
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:58,552
- You can't do that.
- What?

310
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,137
Can they do that?

311
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:07,103
A reminder: the boat
for the mainland will be leaving at 1900.

312
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:12,108
All personnel be at the dock
no later than 1845. No exceptions.

313
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,028
- Good day, Henry.
- Good day, sir.

314
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,627
It's turning the eggs.

315
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:39,343
Perfect timing. I'd hoped they'd hatch
before I had to go to the boat.

316
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:41,887
Henry, why didn't you tell me?

317
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:46,016
I insist on being here when they're born.

318
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:49,145
Come on.

319
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:52,356
Come on, little one.

320
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:00,072
Come on, then.

321
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,327
Very good. Push.

322
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:09,415
- Very good.
- God.

323
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:11,917
Push. Come on.

324
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:15,421
Come on. Come on, then.

325
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:18,507
There you are.

326
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:26,974
They imprint on the first creature
they come in contact with.

327
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:29,977
That's it. Helps them to trust me.

328
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:35,566
I've been present for the birth
of every little creature on this island.

329
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:39,862
Surely not the ones
that have bred in the wild?

330
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:42,323
Actually they can't breed in the wild.

331
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:45,201
Population control is one
of our security precautions.

332
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:48,287
There's no unauthorized breeding
in Jurassic Park.

333
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:51,665
How do you know they can't breed?

334
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:56,253
Because all the animals
in Jurassic Park are female.

335
00:29:56,337 --> 00:29:58,672
We've engineered them that way.

336
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,424
There you are.

337
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:05,471
Oh, my God. Look at that.

338
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:09,183
Blood temperature seems like
about high 80s, maybe.

339
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:10,351
Wu?

340
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:11,769
Ninety-one.

341
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:15,147
- Homoeothermic? It holds that temperature?
- Yes.

342
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,655
But, again, how do you know
they're all female?

343
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:26,825
What, does somebody go out in the park
and pull up the dinosaurs' skirts?

344
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:30,371
We control their chromosomes.
It's really not that difficult.

345
00:30:30,412 --> 00:30:32,957
All vertebrate embryos
are inherently female, anyway.

346
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,752
They just require an extra hormone
given at the right developmental stage...

347
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:37,962
to make them male.

348
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:40,923
- We simply deny them that.
- Deny them that?

349
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:44,718
John, the kind of control
you're attempting is not possible.

350
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:47,763
If there's one thing the history
of evolution has taught us...

351
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:52,268
it's that life will not be contained. Life
breaks free. Expands to new territories...

352
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:55,938
and it crashes through barriers,
painfully, maybe even dangerously...

353
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:58,691
but there it is.

354
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:01,694
There it is.

355
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:07,324
You're implying that a group composed
entirely of female animals will breed?

356
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:11,787
No, I'm simply saying
that life finds a way.

357
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:20,838
What species is this?

358
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,508
It's a Velociraptor.

359
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:30,180
You bred Raptors?

360
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:49,116
Dr. Grant! As I was saying, we laid on
lunch for you before you go into the park.

361
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:52,244
- Our gourmet chef, Alejandro--
- What are they doing?

362
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,168
Feeding them.

363
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:09,261
Alejandro's prepared a delightful menu
for us. Chilean sea bass, I believe.

364
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:11,805
Shall we?

365
00:32:51,512 --> 00:32:53,806
They should all be destroyed.

366
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:56,850
Robert Muldoon.
My game warden from Kenya.

367
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,978
Bit of an alarmist, but knows more
about Raptors than anyone.

368
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,022
What's their growth rate?

369
00:33:02,106 --> 00:33:04,733
They're lethal at eight months,
and I do mean lethal.

370
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:08,320
I've hunted most things that can hunt you,
but the way these move....

371
00:33:08,362 --> 00:33:10,364
- Fast for a biped?
- Cheetah speed.

372
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:13,534
Fifty, sixty miles per hour
if they ever got out in the open.

373
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,369
And they're astonishing jumpers.

374
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:18,664
Yes. That's why we're taking
extreme precautions.

375
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,501
Do they show intelligence?
Was their brain cavity--

376
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:26,839
They show extreme intelligence.
Even problem-solving intelligence.

377
00:33:26,922 --> 00:33:28,507
Especially the big one.

378
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,009
We bred eight originally,
but when she came in...

379
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:34,513
she took over the pride
and killed all but two of the others.

380
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:39,601
That one, when she looks at you,
you can see she's working things out.

381
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,772
That's why we have to feed them like this.

382
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:46,859
She had them all attacking the fences
when the feeders came.

383
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,777
The fences are electrified, right?

384
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:52,030
That's right, but they never attack
the same place twice.

385
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:55,784
They were testing the fences
for weaknesses, systematically.

386
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,704
They remember.

387
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:12,843
Yes. Well, who's hungry?

388
00:34:13,177 --> 00:34:16,889
More adventurous guests
can opt for our jungle river cruise...

389
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,391
or for a close-up look at our majestic....

390
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:22,770
None of these attractions
are ready yet, but the park will open...

391
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:27,191
with the basic tour you are about to take,
and then other rides will come on-line...

392
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:30,903
six or twelve months after that.
Absolutely spectacular designs.

393
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:34,281
- Spared no expense.
- And we can charge anything we want.

394
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:37,075
$2,000 a day, $10,000 a day,
and people will pay it.

395
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:40,037
- And there's the merchandise--
- Donald.

396
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:43,749
This park was not built to cater
only for the super rich.

397
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:46,835
Everyone in the world has the right
to enjoy these animals.

398
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:51,465
Sure. They will.
We'll have a coupon day or something.

399
00:34:56,345 --> 00:35:01,225
The lack of humility before nature
that's being displayed here staggers me.

400
00:35:02,142 --> 00:35:05,813
Thank you. But things are a little different
than you and I had feared.

401
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:07,314
I know. They're a lot worse.

402
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:10,651
Now, wait a second,
we haven't even seen the park yet--

403
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,656
Donald, let him talk. There's
no reason, I want to hear every viewpoint.

404
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:20,410
Don't you see the danger, John,
inherent in what you're doing here?

405
00:35:20,536 --> 00:35:23,622
Genetic power's the most awesome force
the planet's ever seen...

406
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:26,542
but you wield it like a kid
that's found his dad's gun.

407
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:30,170
- It's hardly appropriate to start hurling--
- If I may.

408
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:34,007
I'll tell you the problem
with the scientific power you're using here.

409
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:37,052
It didn't require any discipline to attain it.

410
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,682
You read what others had done,
and you took the next step.

411
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:44,101
You didn't earn the knowledge
for yourselves...

412
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:47,229
so you don't take any responsibility for it.

413
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:51,733
You stood on the shoulders of geniuses
to achieve something as fast as you could.

414
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:56,154
Before you even knew what you had,
you patented it, and packaged it...

415
00:35:56,196 --> 00:36:01,159
and slapped it on a plastic lunch box,
now you're selling it. You're going to sell it.

416
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:03,996
I don't think you're giving us our due credit.

417
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:07,416
Our scientists have done things
which nobody has ever done before.

418
00:36:07,499 --> 00:36:10,752
But your scientists were so preoccupied
with whether they could...

419
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:13,088
they didn't stop to think if they should.

420
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:17,092
Condors. Condors are
on the verge of extinction.

421
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:22,681
If I was to create a flock of condors on this
island, you wouldn't have anything to say.

422
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:25,559
Hold on, this isn't some species
that was obliterated...

423
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:28,812
by deforestation or the building of a dam.

424
00:36:29,062 --> 00:36:33,901
Dinosaurs had their shot
and nature selected them for extinction.

425
00:36:35,736 --> 00:36:39,990
I don't understand this
Luddite attitude. Especially from a scientist.

426
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:44,995
How can we stand in the light of discovery
and not act?

427
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:48,707
What's so great about discovery?
It's a violent, penetrative act...

428
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:52,377
that scars what it explores.
What you call discovery...

429
00:36:53,462 --> 00:36:56,173
I call the rape of the natural world.

430
00:36:57,049 --> 00:37:00,886
The question is, how can you know
anything about an extinct eco-system?

431
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:04,181
And therefore, how could you ever assume
that you can control it?

432
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:08,852
You have poisonous plants in this building.
You picked them because they look good.

433
00:37:08,894 --> 00:37:13,023
But these are aggressive living things
that have no idea what century they're in...

434
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:16,234
and they'll defend themselves.
Violently, if necessary.

435
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:23,533
Dr. Grant, if there's one person here who
could appreciate what I am trying to do....

436
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:30,040
The world has just changed so radically
and we're all running to catch up.

437
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:35,337
I don't want to jump to any conclusions,
but dinosaurs and man...

438
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:39,633
two species separated
by 65 million years of evolution...

439
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:43,178
have just been suddenly
thrown back into the mix together.

440
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:47,641
How can we possibly have
the slightest idea what to expect?

441
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:50,978
I don't believe it.

442
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:54,356
You're meant to come here
and defend me against these characters...

443
00:37:54,398 --> 00:37:58,068
and the only one I've got on my side
is the blood-sucking lawyer.

444
00:37:58,694 --> 00:37:59,861
Thank you.

445
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,120
They're here.

446
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:11,873
You four are gonna have a spot
of company out in the park.

447
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:14,751
Spend a little time with our target audience.

448
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:17,421
- Grandpa!
- Kids!

449
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:23,176
- Wait! Careful with me.
- We missed you.

450
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,428
Me, too.

451
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:28,223
- We loved the presents. They were great.
- Did you enjoy the helicopter?

452
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,976
Yeah, it went down
and we all went right up.

453
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:37,441
Now, kids, come away.
Not too close to the cars.

454
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:41,987
Aren't they lovely?
Aren't they glorious, though?

455
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,573
These will be your transports
for the afternoon.

456
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:47,701
- No drivers?
- No. No drivers. They're electric.

457
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:50,495
They run on this track
in the middle of the roadway here.

458
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:53,665
Totally non-polluting. Top of the line.
Spared no expense.

459
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:55,500
It's an interactive CD-ROM!

460
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:59,421
You touch the right part of the screen
and it talks about whatever you want.

461
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:02,674
Lex, you're all right in there.
Dr. Sattler, come with me.

462
00:39:02,758 --> 00:39:04,676
Dr. Grant, come in the second car.

463
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,345
I'm gonna ride with Dr. Sattler.

464
00:39:18,857 --> 00:39:20,525
I read your book.

465
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,361
That's great.

466
00:39:24,321 --> 00:39:28,533
Do you really think dinosaurs turned
into birds and that's where they went?

467
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:32,287
A few species may have evolved
along those lines.

468
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:40,128
Because they sure don't
look like birds to me.

469
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:43,840
I heard that there was this meteor...

470
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:48,178
hit the earth someplace down in Mexico,
and made this big crater.

471
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:51,014
- Listen....
- Tim.

472
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:54,684
Tim, which car were you planning on?

473
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:58,271
Whichever one you are.

474
00:40:00,941 --> 00:40:05,862
Then I heard about this thing in Omni
about this meteor making all this heat.

475
00:40:06,113 --> 00:40:08,824
It made diamond dust
and that changed the weather.

476
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,408
They died because of the weather.

477
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:14,788
My teacher tells me about this book
by a guy named Bakker. He says--

478
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:20,085
She said I should ride with you
'cause it'd be good for you.

479
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:22,212
The boat
is now loading.

480
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:27,008
Everyone must be on the dock
for the 1900 departure.

481
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:31,346
National Weather Service
is tracking a tropical storm...

482
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,682
about 75 miles west of us.

483
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:36,309
Why didn't I build in Orlando?

484
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:40,147
I'll keep an eye on it.
Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.

485
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:46,444
Ray, start the tour program.

486
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,789
Hold onto your butts.

487
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:10,177
And why did they put
the fiberglass thing?

488
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:12,512
I know.

489
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:23,190
You want to join the future, right?

490
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,734
God help us
when the hands of engineers--

491
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:28,945
On your tour,
the appropriate information will be...

492
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:31,072
automatically selected
and displayed for you.

493
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:32,199
Look!

494
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:35,285
Touch the area
of the screen displaying the icon.

495
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:36,620
Are we gonna hit that?

496
00:41:36,703 --> 00:41:38,705
Welcome
to Jurassic Park.

497
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,253
What have they got in there, King Kong?

498
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,519
The voice you're now hearing
is Richard Kiley.

499
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:03,230
We spared no expense.

500
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:04,773
On the right...

501
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:09,778
you'll see a herd of the first dinosaurs
on our tour, called Dilophosaurus.

502
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:12,739
- Dilophosaurus!
- Shit!

503
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,824
One of the earliest carnivores...

504
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:18,245
we now know Dilophosaurus
is actually poisonous...

505
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:23,291
spitting its venom at its prey,
causing blindness and paralysis...

506
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:26,503
allowing the carnivore to eat at its leisure.

507
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:30,840
This makes Dilophosaurus a beautiful
but deadly addition...

508
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:32,842
to Jurassic Park.

509
00:42:39,975 --> 00:42:41,476
Alan?

510
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,728
Where?

511
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:48,775
Damn.

512
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:55,782
Vehicle headlights are on
and not responding.

513
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:58,368
Those shouldn't be running off
of car batteries.

514
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,996
Item 151 on today's glitch list.

515
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:04,291
We have all the problems
of a major theme park and a major zoo...

516
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:07,335
and the computers
aren't even on their feet yet.

517
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:13,049
Dennis, our lives are in your hands
and you have butterfingers?

518
00:43:14,718 --> 00:43:17,137
I am totally unappreciated in my time.

519
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:21,182
You can run this park from this room
with minimal staff for up to three days.

520
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:25,228
You think that kind of automation is easy?
Or cheap?

521
00:43:25,562 --> 00:43:28,106
You know anybody
who can network eight machines...

522
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:32,027
and de-bug two million lines of code
on my salary? If so, I want to see them.

523
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:36,531
Sorry about your financial problems,
I really am. But they are your problems.

524
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:39,367
You're absolutely right.
Everything's my problem.

525
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:43,663
I will not be drawn into another
financial debate with you.

526
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:44,998
I really will not.

527
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,083
There's been hardly any debate at all.

528
00:43:47,167 --> 00:43:50,003
I don't blame people for their mistakes.

529
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,881
But I do ask that they pay for them.

530
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:54,341
Thanks, Dad.

531
00:43:55,467 --> 00:43:56,676
The headlights.

532
00:43:56,718 --> 00:43:59,346
I'll debug the tour program
when they get back, okay?

533
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:02,724
It'll eat a lot of compute cycles.
We'll lose part of the system.

534
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:06,061
There's a finite amount of memory,
you can't use it for everything.

535
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:08,229
Are you gonna compile
for a half an hour--

536
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:09,731
Quiet, all of you!

537
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:13,109
They're approaching
the Tyrannosaur paddock.

538
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,664
God creates dinosaurs.
God destroys dinosaurs.

539
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:12,919
God creates man. Man destroys God.
Man creates dinosaurs.

540
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:17,674
Dinosaurs eat man.

541
00:45:19,134 --> 00:45:21,177
Woman inherits the earth.

542
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:32,021
We'll try to tempt the Rex.
Keep watching the fence.

543
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:44,367
What's going to happen to the goat?

544
00:45:48,329 --> 00:45:50,165
He's going to eat the goat?

545
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:51,749
Excellent.

546
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:56,087
What's the matter, kid?
You never had lamb chops?

547
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:58,965
I happen to be a vegetarian.

548
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:10,560
T. Rex doesn't want to be fed.
He wants to hunt.

549
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:16,274
You can't just suppress 65 million years
of gut instinct.

550
00:46:38,171 --> 00:46:43,092
Eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs
on your dinosaur tour, right?

551
00:46:46,721 --> 00:46:49,057
Hello. Yes?

552
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:51,684
I really hate that man.

553
00:46:56,856 --> 00:47:01,694
The Tyrannosaur doesn't obey
any set patterns or park schedules.

554
00:47:01,778 --> 00:47:04,030
The essence of chaos.

555
00:47:05,198 --> 00:47:07,158
I'm still not clear on chaos.

556
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:12,664
It simply deals with unpredictability
in complex systems.

557
00:47:14,249 --> 00:47:16,251
The shorthand is the Butterfly Effect.

558
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:18,545
A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking...

559
00:47:18,628 --> 00:47:21,714
and in Central Park
you get rain instead of sunshine.

560
00:47:23,925 --> 00:47:25,843
- Was I going too fast?
- I missed it.

561
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:27,053
I did a fly-by.

562
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:29,889
Give me that glass of water.
We'll conduct an experiment.

563
00:47:29,973 --> 00:47:33,685
We should be still. The car's bouncing.
That's okay. It's just an example.

564
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:36,187
Put your hand flat like a hieroglyphic.

565
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:38,690
A drop of water falls on your hand.

566
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:41,484
Which way will the drop roll off?
Which finger?

567
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:43,236
Thumb, I'd say.

568
00:47:45,947 --> 00:47:47,991
Freeze your hand. Don't move.

569
00:47:48,074 --> 00:47:50,994
I'll do the same thing,
start with the same place again.

570
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:52,495
Which way, now?

571
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:55,540
Let's say back the same way.

572
00:47:57,917 --> 00:48:00,295
It changed. Why?

573
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:02,839
Because tiny variations...

574
00:48:03,339 --> 00:48:05,800
the orientation of the hairs on your hands...

575
00:48:05,842 --> 00:48:07,176
Alan, look at this.

576
00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:11,014
...the amount of blood distending
your vessels, imperfections in the skin...

577
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:13,975
- "Imperfections in the skin"?
- ...just microscopic...

578
00:48:14,017 --> 00:48:16,978
Never repeat and vastly affect the outcome.

579
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:19,397
- That's what?
- Unpredictability.

580
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:25,361
There. Look at this. See? I'm right again.

581
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:29,866
Nobody could predict that Dr. Grant would
suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle.

582
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:34,454
And there's another example.

583
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:40,376
See, here I am now by myself,
talking to myself. That's Chaos Theory.

584
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:44,672
Stop the program.

585
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:51,095
I told you, how many times, we needed
locking mechanisms on the vehicle doors.

586
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:54,015
Stopping park
vehicles, rebooting program.

587
00:48:54,057 --> 00:48:56,184
We're on. Will notify for resume.

588
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:00,688
I'll switch it over
to TelePrompTer.

589
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:04,442
- Circuit integrities?
- Screen says faulty sensor.

590
00:49:06,778 --> 00:49:10,323
- I'll call security.
- We're at full go. Looks good.

591
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:14,118
Like I said, there's this other book
by a guy named Bakker...

592
00:49:14,202 --> 00:49:16,245
and he says dinosaurs died from diseases.

593
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:19,499
- Where are we going?
- He didn't say they turned into birds.

594
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,793
Anyone else think we shouldn't be out here?

595
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:25,046
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
Like this.

596
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:27,840
- Really?
- Yours was fully illustrated.

597
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:30,218
You okay?

598
00:49:30,343 --> 00:49:32,720
Look at this. Wait. Watch.

599
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:35,306
Come on. Watch this.

600
00:49:37,225 --> 00:49:38,726
Whoa.

601
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,563
Everybody stay here.

602
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:51,322
Timmy.

603
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:58,955
Wow.

604
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:02,959
- Okay?
- Of course.

605
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:09,716
Don't be scared. Come on, it's okay.
Muldoon tranquillized her for me.

606
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:11,092
She's sick.

607
00:50:19,976 --> 00:50:21,394
Oh, my God.

608
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:38,411
Hey, baby.

609
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:46,419
She was always my favorite
when I was a kid...

610
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:49,881
and now I see
she's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.

611
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:55,595
It's okay.

612
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:01,309
Microvesicles. That's interesting.

613
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:05,688
Thanks. What are her symptoms?

614
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:09,025
Imbalance, disorientation,
labored breathing.

615
00:51:09,192 --> 00:51:11,360
It seems to happen
every six weeks or so.

616
00:51:11,444 --> 00:51:12,820
Six weeks.

617
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:28,002
- These are dilated.
- They are?

618
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:31,130
- Take a look.
- I'll be damned.

619
00:51:31,631 --> 00:51:35,343
That's pharmacological.
From local plant life.

620
00:51:42,809 --> 00:51:44,936
Is this West Indian lilac?

621
00:51:45,353 --> 00:51:48,940
Yes. We know they're toxic,
but the animals don't eat them.

622
00:51:53,361 --> 00:51:56,197
- Are you sure?
- Pretty sure.

623
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:59,951
There's only one way to be positive.

624
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:03,162
I'd have to see the dinosaur's droppings.

625
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:07,500
Dino droppings? Droppings?

626
00:52:13,256 --> 00:52:15,508
Yeah, I got that.

627
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:19,846
That storm center hasn't dissipated
or changed course.

628
00:52:20,012 --> 00:52:22,431
We're gonna have to cut the tour short.

629
00:52:22,515 --> 00:52:24,350
We'll pick it up again tomorrow.

630
00:52:24,392 --> 00:52:27,687
- Are you sure we have to?
- It's not worth taking the chance.

631
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:31,357
- Sustained winds at 45 knots.
- Tell them when they're in the cars.

632
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,112
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle leaving
for the dock leaves in five minutes.

633
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:38,531
Drop what you're doing and leave now.

634
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:41,951
Damn!

635
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:51,502
That is one big pile of shit.

636
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:01,512
You're right.
There's no trace of lilac berries.

637
00:53:01,554 --> 00:53:03,681
That's so odd, though.

638
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:07,768
All right,
she's suffering from Melia toxicity...

639
00:53:09,478 --> 00:53:11,772
every six weeks.

640
00:53:13,399 --> 00:53:16,944
Let's see, rats.

641
00:53:17,904 --> 00:53:21,073
She's tenacious.

642
00:53:21,991 --> 00:53:23,701
You have no idea.

643
00:53:25,745 --> 00:53:29,498
You will remember to wash your hands
before you eat anything?

644
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:45,806
Doctors, if you please,
I have to insist that we get moving.

645
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:51,812
I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding
and finish up with the Trike.

646
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:54,357
Sure. I'm in a gas-powered jeep.

647
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,193
I'll drop her off at the center
before I make the boat.

648
00:53:57,276 --> 00:53:59,987
Great.
Then I'll catch up with you later.

649
00:54:00,071 --> 00:54:01,197
You sure?

650
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,075
Yeah, I want to stay with her
a little longer.

651
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,576
Okay, then.

652
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:24,679
There's nothing I can do. The captain says
we got to go, we got to go.

653
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,472
You've got to give me the time.

654
00:54:26,514 --> 00:54:30,017
I did a test run, it took me 20 minutes.
I think I can push it to 18...

655
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:32,395
but you've got to give me
at least 15 minutes.

656
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,854
No promises.

657
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:44,323
Visitor vehicles
are returning to the garage.

658
00:54:46,701 --> 00:54:51,455
So much for our first tour.
Two no-shows and one sick Triceratops.

659
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:54,625
It could've been worse.

660
00:54:55,835 --> 00:54:57,086
A lot worse.

661
00:54:57,211 --> 00:55:01,340
Anybody want a soda
or something? I'm going up to the machine.

662
00:55:01,382 --> 00:55:03,634
I thought maybe
I'd get somebody something.

663
00:55:03,718 --> 00:55:07,471
I've had only sweets
and I'm gonna get something salty.

664
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,725
I finished debugging the phones.

665
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:13,894
I was going to, so I did.

666
00:55:14,145 --> 00:55:17,189
So I debugged the phones.
And I thought maybe...

667
00:55:17,273 --> 00:55:20,026
I should tell you the system
will be compiling...

668
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:22,987
for 18 to 20 minutes,
so some of the minor systems...

669
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:27,033
they might go on and off for a while,
but it's nothing to worry about.

670
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:53,642
- Do you got any kids?
- Me? Hell, yeah. Three. I love kids.

671
00:55:55,436 --> 00:55:57,813
Anything at all can and does happen.

672
00:55:58,314 --> 00:56:00,816
Same with wives, for that matter.

673
00:56:01,192 --> 00:56:03,736
- You're married?
- Occasionally.

674
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:10,201
I'm always on the lookout
for a future ex-Mrs. Malcolm.

675
00:56:23,672 --> 00:56:26,967
Five, four, three...

676
00:56:28,886 --> 00:56:29,929
two, one.

677
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:40,523
- That's odd.
- What?

678
00:56:40,815 --> 00:56:43,234
Door security systems are shutting down.

679
00:56:43,317 --> 00:56:46,529
Nedry said a few systems
would go off-line, didn't he?

680
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:44,795
By the way, Dr. Sattler...

681
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:49,091
- she's not available, is she?
- Why?

682
00:57:52,011 --> 00:57:54,805
- I'm sorry. You two are....
- Yeah.

683
00:57:58,184 --> 00:58:02,021
- What'd I touch?
- You didn't touch anything. We stopped.

684
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,573
What the hell?

685
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:15,659
- What now?
- Fences are failing all over the park.

686
00:58:16,035 --> 00:58:18,204
Find Nedry. Check the vending machines.

687
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:52,196
Just look at this work station.

688
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:55,866
- What a complete slob.
- Raptor fences aren't out, are they?

689
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:04,583
No, no. They're still on.

690
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:09,755
Why the hell would he turn
the other ones off?

691
00:59:49,795 --> 00:59:51,463
Access main program.

692
00:59:52,298 --> 00:59:53,966
Access main security.

693
00:59:54,717 --> 00:59:56,802
Access main program grid.

694
01:00:05,561 --> 01:00:07,646
You didn't say the magic word.

695
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:11,608
Please! God damn it. I hate this hacker crap.

696
01:00:11,734 --> 01:00:15,154
Phone Nedry's people
in Cambridge.

697
01:00:17,406 --> 01:00:18,949
Phones are out, too.

698
01:00:22,453 --> 01:00:24,330
Where did the vehicles stop?

699
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:46,977
Their radio's out, too.

700
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:49,646
- Gennaro said to stay put.
- Kids okay?

701
01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:51,899
I didn't ask. Why wouldn't they be?

702
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:53,692
- Kids get scared.
- What's scary?

703
01:00:53,776 --> 01:00:56,904
- It's just a little hiccup in the power.
- I'm not scared.

704
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:59,365
- I didn't say you were scared.
- I know.

705
01:01:00,032 --> 01:01:01,408
Boo!

706
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,995
Hey, where did you find those?

707
01:01:05,204 --> 01:01:07,831
- In the box, under my seat.
- Are they heavy?

708
01:01:08,082 --> 01:01:10,751
- Yeah.
- Then they're expensive. Put them back.

709
01:01:17,966 --> 01:01:19,510
Don't scare me.

710
01:01:31,105 --> 01:01:32,856
Cool. Night vision.

711
01:01:58,340 --> 01:01:59,758
Did you feel that?

712
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,378
Maybe it's the power
trying to come back on.

713
01:02:39,006 --> 01:02:40,299
What is that?

714
01:02:57,191 --> 01:02:58,567
Where's the goat?

715
01:03:21,882 --> 01:03:23,133
Jesus!

716
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,598
He left us.

717
01:03:41,068 --> 01:03:45,405
- Where does he think he's going?
- When you got to go, you got to go.

718
01:04:03,549 --> 01:04:04,841
Dr. Grant.

719
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:19,856
I hate being right all the time.

720
01:04:28,949 --> 01:04:33,078
Keep absolutely still.
Its vision is based on movement.

721
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:49,011
Turn the light off.

722
01:04:53,932 --> 01:04:55,392
Turn the light off!

723
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:54,117
- Hurry! Turn it off!
- I'm sorry!

724
01:05:58,288 --> 01:06:00,290
You're the one who turned it--

725
01:07:19,161 --> 01:07:20,495
Ian, freeze!

726
01:07:20,954 --> 01:07:22,414
Get the kids!

727
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:25,667
- Get rid of the flare!
- Get the kids!

728
01:07:26,668 --> 01:07:28,295
Get rid of the flare!

729
01:07:31,256 --> 01:07:32,799
Hail Mary, full of grace....

730
01:07:50,484 --> 01:07:51,610
No!

731
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:56,782
Dr. Grant!

732
01:08:01,328 --> 01:08:03,997
I'm stuck. The seat's got my feet.

733
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,374
I'll get you next. You're okay.

734
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:09,169
You're all right.

735
01:08:09,878 --> 01:08:11,505
Tim!

736
01:08:15,175 --> 01:08:18,094
Don't move.
He can't see us if we don't move.

737
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:25,579
Lex, you're choking me.

738
01:09:28,415 --> 01:09:29,666
Grab the wire.

739
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:53,315
"Keycheck space minus 0.
Keychecks off, safety space minus 0."

740
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:56,610
He's turning the safety systems off.
Doesn't want anybody to see.

741
01:09:56,693 --> 01:09:59,988
Look at this next entry.
It's the kicker. "White rabbit object."

742
01:10:00,071 --> 01:10:03,992
It did it all. With the keychecks off,
the computer didn't file the keystrokes.

743
01:10:04,075 --> 01:10:07,787
The way to find them is to check
the computer's lines of code one by one.

744
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:11,082
- How many lines of code are there?
- About two million.

745
01:10:11,333 --> 01:10:12,834
- Two million?
- Yeah.

746
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:20,425
Robert, I wonder if perhaps you would
be good enough to take a gas jeep...

747
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:24,262
and bring back my grandchildren.

748
01:10:25,138 --> 01:10:26,306
Sure.

749
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:30,602
I'm going with him.

750
01:10:33,939 --> 01:10:35,106
John.

751
01:10:40,946 --> 01:10:44,658
I can't get Jurassic Park back online
without Dennis Nedry.

752
01:10:47,494 --> 01:10:49,120
Should have been there by now.

753
01:11:04,511 --> 01:11:05,804
Damn it!

754
01:11:12,519 --> 01:11:13,895
There's the road!

755
01:11:20,485 --> 01:11:24,531
Winch this sucker off the thing
and then I tie it to that thing there.

756
01:11:24,572 --> 01:11:27,993
I'll pull down this thing here,
and pull it back up again.

757
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:39,713
My glasses.
I can afford more glasses!

758
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:12,287
You've got time. You can do it.
Do it. Come on, Dennis.

759
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,920
Hello.

760
01:12:25,884 --> 01:12:28,678
Yeah, that's nice. I've got to go.

761
01:12:39,898 --> 01:12:41,232
Nice boy.

762
01:12:43,318 --> 01:12:44,944
Nice dinosaur.

763
01:12:45,779 --> 01:12:49,199
Thought you were one of your big brothers.
You're not so bad.

764
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:53,161
What do you want? A little food?
Look at me. I just fell down a hill.

765
01:12:53,244 --> 01:12:56,748
I'm soaking wet. I don't have any food.
I have nothing on me.

766
01:12:58,333 --> 01:13:00,543
Go on. Play fetch?

767
01:13:02,545 --> 01:13:03,797
Look, stick.

768
01:13:05,465 --> 01:13:07,634
Look at stick.

769
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:11,471
Stick, stupid.
Fetch the stick, boy. Look at the stick.

770
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:14,307
You like the stick? Go on and get it.

771
01:13:14,474 --> 01:13:16,309
No wonder you're extinct.

772
01:13:17,519 --> 01:13:20,188
I'm gonna run you over
when I come back down.

773
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:37,807
Timmy!

774
01:14:41,895 --> 01:14:43,938
Now, Lex. Listen.

775
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:46,316
Lex, I'm right here.

776
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:49,485
I'll look after you.
I have to help your brother.

777
01:14:49,569 --> 01:14:51,779
Stay right here and wait for me.

778
01:14:52,155 --> 01:14:54,449
He left us.

779
01:14:54,949 --> 01:14:57,452
But that's not what I'm going to do.

780
01:14:59,454 --> 01:15:00,663
Okay?

781
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:04,334
Stay here.

782
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:33,488
You hear me? I'm coming up.

783
01:15:34,197 --> 01:15:38,117
I hate climbing.
I hate trees, way too high.

784
01:16:06,437 --> 01:16:07,522
You okay?

785
01:16:10,525 --> 01:16:11,776
I threw up.

786
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:16,114
That's okay.

787
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:18,741
Just give me your hand.

788
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:27,000
Tim, I won't tell anyone you threw up.
Just give me your hand.

789
01:16:36,009 --> 01:16:37,510
Here, I've got you.

790
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:40,346
Okay.

791
01:16:40,722 --> 01:16:44,559
- That's good. Over the rail.
- Don't pull me too hard.

792
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:51,357
Stand on the door. Hang on to me.

793
01:16:55,028 --> 01:16:57,697
- That's not too bad, right, Timmy?
- Yes, it is.

794
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:00,491
It's like a tree house.
Your dad ever build you one?

795
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:02,160
- No.
- Yeah, me, too.

796
01:17:03,828 --> 01:17:06,622
The thing about climbing is,
you never look down.

797
01:17:06,706 --> 01:17:08,291
This is impossible.

798
01:17:08,583 --> 01:17:13,129
- How am I going to do this? It's about--
- I'm going to help you with your footing.

799
01:17:16,924 --> 01:17:18,051
Oh, no.

800
01:17:18,593 --> 01:17:19,886
Tim, go.

801
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:43,659
Go, Tim, go!

802
01:17:51,959 --> 01:17:53,169
Faster, Tim!

803
01:17:59,884 --> 01:18:01,010
Tim, jump!

804
01:18:05,056 --> 01:18:06,182
Go, Tim.

805
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:17,026
We're back in the car again.

806
01:18:19,237 --> 01:18:21,364
At least you're out of the tree.

807
01:18:26,661 --> 01:18:29,163
Where's the other car?

808
01:18:31,541 --> 01:18:32,708
Alan!

809
01:18:33,835 --> 01:18:35,086
Dr. Grant!

810
01:18:51,227 --> 01:18:54,689
- I think this was Gennaro.
- I think this was, too.

811
01:18:58,234 --> 01:19:00,778
- I think it's ahead of us.
- It could be anywhere.

812
01:19:00,862 --> 01:19:04,282
With fences down, it can wander in and out
of any paddock it likes.

813
01:19:11,289 --> 01:19:13,291
He's put a tourniquet on. Ian.

814
01:19:15,001 --> 01:19:17,712
Remind me to thank John
for a lovely weekend.

815
01:19:22,717 --> 01:19:24,469
Can we chance moving him?

816
01:19:25,803 --> 01:19:27,263
Please chance it.

817
01:19:35,813 --> 01:19:37,398
Ellie, come on!

818
01:19:44,947 --> 01:19:46,157
It's the other car!

819
01:19:46,741 --> 01:19:47,992
Dr. Grant?

820
01:19:52,497 --> 01:19:53,998
They're not here.

821
01:20:23,361 --> 01:20:24,862
Anybody hear that?

822
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:30,826
It's an impact tremor, is what it is.

823
01:20:31,702 --> 01:20:33,496
I'm fairly alarmed here.

824
01:20:34,956 --> 01:20:38,668
Come on. We've got to get out of here.
Now! Right now!

825
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:40,545
Let's go.

826
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:53,307
Must go faster.

827
01:20:55,977 --> 01:20:58,813
Here it comes! Stand on it! Fifth gear!

828
01:21:05,194 --> 01:21:08,364
- Get off the stick! Bloody move!
- Look out!

829
01:21:35,391 --> 01:21:37,727
Think they'll have that on the tour?

830
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:47,528
Are you hearing this?

831
01:21:54,035 --> 01:21:56,162
Come on, Tim. Hurry up.

832
01:21:57,163 --> 01:21:58,873
Let's get up this tree.

833
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:04,670
Come on, Tim, it's okay. Listen. Try up here.

834
01:22:06,505 --> 01:22:07,757
Oh, man.

835
01:22:09,008 --> 01:22:10,343
I hate trees.

836
01:22:10,885 --> 01:22:14,513
- They don't bother me.
- Yeah? Well, you weren't in the last one.

837
01:22:29,153 --> 01:22:32,657
Look at the Brontosauruses.
I mean, Brachiosaurus.

838
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,618
They're singing.

839
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:06,774
Don't let the monsters come over here.

840
01:23:06,857 --> 01:23:10,277
They're not monsters, they're animals.
These are herbivores.

841
01:23:10,528 --> 01:23:13,823
They only eat vegetables.
For you, I think they'd make an exception.

842
01:23:13,948 --> 01:23:15,616
I hate the other kind.

843
01:23:17,660 --> 01:23:20,496
They just do what they do.

844
01:23:40,599 --> 01:23:41,809
What's that?

845
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:50,985
What are you and Ellie going to do now,
if you don't dig up bones anymore?

846
01:23:52,361 --> 01:23:53,654
I don't know.

847
01:23:54,864 --> 01:23:57,283
I guess we'll just have to evolve, too.

848
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:03,205
What do you call a blind dinosaur?

849
01:24:05,207 --> 01:24:09,211
- What do you call a blind dinosaur?
- "Do-you-think-he-saurus."

850
01:24:12,923 --> 01:24:15,426
What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?

851
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:17,636
You got me.

852
01:24:17,762 --> 01:24:19,847
A "Do-you-think-he-saurus rex."

853
01:24:22,475 --> 01:24:24,602
- Alan?
- Yeah?

854
01:24:25,311 --> 01:24:28,481
What if the dinosaurs come back
while we're all asleep?

855
01:24:30,775 --> 01:24:32,985
- I'll stay awake.
- All night?

856
01:24:35,571 --> 01:24:36,697
All night.

857
01:25:26,956 --> 01:25:28,582
They were all melting.

858
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:35,422
Malcolm's okay for now.
I gave him a shot of morphine.

859
01:25:39,301 --> 01:25:40,845
They'll be fine.

860
01:25:41,846 --> 01:25:46,141
Who better to get the children through
Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?

861
01:25:50,604 --> 01:25:52,356
You know, the first...

862
01:25:53,649 --> 01:25:57,111
attraction I ever built
when I came down from Scotland...

863
01:25:58,779 --> 01:26:01,240
was a flea circus, Petticoat Lane.

864
01:26:02,658 --> 01:26:04,493
Really quite wonderful.

865
01:26:05,035 --> 01:26:08,330
I had a wee trapeze and a...

866
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:12,710
carousel...

867
01:26:16,672 --> 01:26:18,048
and a seesaw.

868
01:26:19,174 --> 01:26:21,385
They all move motorized, of course.

869
01:26:21,719 --> 01:26:24,430
People said they saw the fleas.
"I can see the fleas.

870
01:26:24,513 --> 01:26:26,265
"Can't you see the fleas?"

871
01:26:27,016 --> 01:26:31,353
Clown fleas, high-wire fleas,
and fleas on parade.

872
01:26:37,526 --> 01:26:39,028
With this place...

873
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:44,491
I wanted to show them something
that wasn't an illusion.

874
01:26:45,492 --> 01:26:48,579
Something that was real.
Something that they could...

875
01:26:51,707 --> 01:26:53,167
see and touch.

876
01:26:57,922 --> 01:27:00,341
An aim not devoid of merit.

877
01:27:04,929 --> 01:27:08,557
But you can't think through this one, John.
You have to feel it.

878
01:27:10,768 --> 01:27:12,519
You're absolutely right.

879
01:27:14,313 --> 01:27:16,649
Hiring Nedry was a mistake, that's obvious.

880
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:19,443
We're over-dependent on automation,
I can see that now.

881
01:27:19,526 --> 01:27:22,154
Next time, everything's correctable.

882
01:27:22,947 --> 01:27:26,116
Creation is an act of sheer will.

883
01:27:28,452 --> 01:27:30,412
Next time, it'll be flawless.

884
01:27:30,996 --> 01:27:34,333
It's still the flea circus. It's all an illusion.

885
01:27:34,458 --> 01:27:35,960
When we have control--

886
01:27:36,043 --> 01:27:38,712
You've never had control!
That's the illusion.

887
01:27:38,879 --> 01:27:41,548
I was overwhelmed
by the power of this place.

888
01:27:42,967 --> 01:27:44,426
I made a mistake, too.

889
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:48,305
I didn't have enough respect
for that power, and it's out now.

890
01:27:50,933 --> 01:27:54,103
The only thing that matters now
are the people we love.

891
01:27:56,271 --> 01:27:58,399
Alan and Lex and Tim.

892
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:03,195
John, they're out there,
where people are dying.

893
01:28:20,212 --> 01:28:21,338
It's good.

894
01:28:25,342 --> 01:28:26,802
Spared no expense.

895
01:28:54,121 --> 01:28:57,291
- Go away!
- It's okay. It's a Brachiosaurus.

896
01:28:57,958 --> 01:29:00,627
It's a "Veggie-saurus", Lex. "Veggie-saurus."

897
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:02,463
Veggie.

898
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:05,132
Come on. Come on, girl.

899
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:10,721
Come on, baby.

900
01:29:14,183 --> 01:29:15,601
Go.

901
01:29:17,144 --> 01:29:18,645
I'm not letting go.

902
01:29:30,532 --> 01:29:33,368
- It looks like it has a cold.
- Yeah. Maybe.

903
01:29:33,744 --> 01:29:35,370
- Can I touch it?
- Sure.

904
01:29:35,704 --> 01:29:38,749
Just think of it as kind of a big cow.

905
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:43,337
I like cows.

906
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:55,724
Come on, girl. Come on up here, girl.

907
01:30:03,190 --> 01:30:04,441
God bless you.

908
01:30:09,822 --> 01:30:13,826
- Yuck.
- Great. Now she won't try anything new.

909
01:30:14,243 --> 01:30:17,287
She'll sit in her room, never come out,
play on her computer.

910
01:30:17,371 --> 01:30:20,165
- I'm a hacker.
- That's what I said. You're a nerd.

911
01:30:20,249 --> 01:30:23,502
I am not a computer nerd.
I prefer to be called a hacker.

912
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:24,962
God.

913
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:31,426
You know what this is?

914
01:30:33,345 --> 01:30:35,347
It's a dinosaur egg.

915
01:30:36,056 --> 01:30:39,268
The dinosaurs are breeding.

916
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:46,525
But my grandpa said
all the dinosaurs were girls.

917
01:30:47,901 --> 01:30:50,154
- Amphibian DNA.
- What's that?

918
01:30:51,864 --> 01:30:53,907
Well, on the tour...

919
01:30:54,158 --> 01:30:58,954
the film said they used frog DNA
to fill in the gene-sequence gaps.

920
01:30:59,121 --> 01:31:02,499
They mutated the dinosaur genetic code...

921
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,794
and blended it with that of frogs.

922
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:13,177
Some West African frogs have been known
to change sex from male to female...

923
01:31:13,218 --> 01:31:15,304
in a single sex environment.

924
01:31:17,181 --> 01:31:18,682
Malcolm was right.

925
01:31:20,225 --> 01:31:21,393
Look.

926
01:31:30,027 --> 01:31:31,737
Life found a way.

927
01:31:34,031 --> 01:31:38,660
No. That's crazy. You're out of
your mind. He's absolutely out of his mind.

928
01:31:39,286 --> 01:31:41,496
Wait. What exactly would this mean?

929
01:31:41,622 --> 01:31:45,500
We're talking about a calculated risk,
which is the only option left to us.

930
01:31:45,542 --> 01:31:50,005
We'll never find the command Nedry used.
He's covered his tracks far too well.

931
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:53,342
I think it's obvious now
that he's not coming back.

932
01:31:53,467 --> 01:31:58,013
- So, shutting down the entire system--
- Get somebody else. I won't do it.

933
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:03,227
Shutting down the system is the only way
to wipe out everything he did.

934
01:32:04,436 --> 01:32:08,023
Now, as I understand it,
all the systems will then come back...

935
01:32:08,190 --> 01:32:10,901
on their original start-up mode. Correct?

936
01:32:11,151 --> 01:32:14,446
Theoretically, yes. We've never shut down
the entire system before.

937
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:17,491
- It may not come back on.
- Would we get the phones back?

938
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:19,201
Yes, again, in theory.

939
01:32:19,826 --> 01:32:23,247
What about the lysine contingency?
We could put that into effect.

940
01:32:23,330 --> 01:32:26,166
- What's that?
- That's absolutely out of the question.

941
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:29,086
The lysine contingency
prevents the spread of animals...

942
01:32:29,169 --> 01:32:31,046
if they ever get off the island.

943
01:32:31,129 --> 01:32:34,800
Wu inserted a gene that creates
a faulty enzyme in protein metabolism.

944
01:32:34,883 --> 01:32:37,803
The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid, lysine.

945
01:32:37,886 --> 01:32:41,640
Unless they're supplied with lysine by us,
they slip into a coma and die.

946
01:32:41,723 --> 01:32:44,184
People are dying.

947
01:32:48,397 --> 01:32:50,774
Will you please shut down the system?

948
01:33:12,838 --> 01:33:14,506
Hold on to your butts.

949
01:33:34,359 --> 01:33:35,527
It's okay.

950
01:33:35,652 --> 01:33:38,280
Look, see that? It's on. It worked.

951
01:33:40,782 --> 01:33:43,160
What do you mean it worked?
Everything's off.

952
01:33:43,243 --> 01:33:47,331
Shutdown tripped the circuit breakers.
Turn them back on, reboot a few systems:

953
01:33:47,456 --> 01:33:50,834
telephones, security doors,
half dozen others, but it worked.

954
01:33:50,917 --> 01:33:53,170
- System's ready.
- Where are the breakers?

955
01:33:53,253 --> 01:33:55,172
Maintenance shed
at the end of the compound.

956
01:33:55,213 --> 01:33:57,966
Three minutes, I'll have the power back on
in the park.

957
01:33:58,008 --> 01:34:01,136
Just to be safe, I want everybody
in the emergency bunker...

958
01:34:01,178 --> 01:34:04,598
until Mr. Arnold returns,
and the whole system's running again.

959
01:34:04,890 --> 01:34:06,350
- I'm tired.
- I'm dirty.

960
01:34:06,433 --> 01:34:07,851
I'm hot.

961
01:34:08,018 --> 01:34:11,772
Looking at the map,
I'd say the visitor's center is just a mile...

962
01:34:12,439 --> 01:34:15,734
over that rise there. Just keep--

963
01:34:18,612 --> 01:34:20,072
What is that?

964
01:34:22,366 --> 01:34:24,576
Tim, can you tell me what they are?

965
01:34:25,952 --> 01:34:27,329
They are...

966
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:32,876
Gallimimus.

967
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:35,504
Are those meat-eating?

968
01:34:37,089 --> 01:34:38,507
"Meat-asauruses"?

969
01:34:43,387 --> 01:34:45,847
Look at the wheeling.
Uniform direction changes.

970
01:34:45,931 --> 01:34:48,642
Just like a flock of birds evading a predator.

971
01:34:50,143 --> 01:34:53,271
They're flocking this way.

972
01:35:36,273 --> 01:35:38,483
- I want to go now.
- Just look how it eats.

973
01:35:38,525 --> 01:35:39,818
Please.

974
01:35:39,943 --> 01:35:42,696
I bet you'll never look at birds
the same way again.

975
01:35:42,779 --> 01:35:44,823
- Yes.
- Go now.

976
01:35:46,658 --> 01:35:49,286
Okay. Keep low and follow me.

977
01:35:51,746 --> 01:35:53,498
Look how much blood.

978
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:57,836
God. Something went wrong.

979
01:35:58,753 --> 01:36:02,340
Something's happened. Something's wrong.

980
01:36:05,051 --> 01:36:06,678
This is just a delay.

981
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:09,848
That's all it is.
All major theme parks have delays.

982
01:36:10,056 --> 01:36:14,394
When they opened Disneyland in 1956,
nothing worked.

983
01:36:14,853 --> 01:36:18,523
If the Pirates of the Caribbean
breaks down, the pirates don't eat tourists.

984
01:36:18,607 --> 01:36:23,528
I can't wait any more. Something's wrong.
I'm gonna go get the power back on.

985
01:36:23,778 --> 01:36:26,823
You can't just stroll down the road,
you know?

986
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:30,327
Don't let's be too hasty.
I mean, it's only been gone....

987
01:36:32,996 --> 01:36:34,998
- I'm going with you.
- Okay.

988
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:51,848
Sorry.

989
01:36:55,685 --> 01:36:59,940
Now, this isn't going to be just like
switching on the kitchen light.

990
01:37:00,065 --> 01:37:03,527
But I think I can follow this
and then talk you through it.

991
01:37:07,906 --> 01:37:09,115
Right.

992
01:37:15,121 --> 01:37:17,165
But it ought to be me, really, going.

993
01:37:17,249 --> 01:37:20,085
- Why?
- I'm a.... And you're a....

994
01:37:21,586 --> 01:37:23,922
- Look.
- Come on, let's go.

995
01:37:24,005 --> 01:37:27,259
We can discuss sexism
in survival situations when I get back.

996
01:37:27,342 --> 01:37:30,971
You just take me through this step by step.
I'm on Channel 2.

997
01:37:31,054 --> 01:37:32,097
Right.

998
01:38:08,008 --> 01:38:10,719
The shutdown must've turned off
all the fences.

999
01:38:11,344 --> 01:38:15,015
Damn it, even Nedry knew better
than to mess with the Raptor pen.

1000
01:38:20,729 --> 01:38:21,980
Come on, this way.

1001
01:38:29,654 --> 01:38:31,615
I can see the shed from here.

1002
01:38:31,823 --> 01:38:33,533
We can make it if we run.

1003
01:38:33,867 --> 01:38:36,411
No. We can't.

1004
01:38:37,329 --> 01:38:38,663
Why not?

1005
01:38:39,164 --> 01:38:41,082
Because we're being hunted.

1006
01:38:42,417 --> 01:38:44,419
In the bushes, straight ahead.

1007
01:38:47,047 --> 01:38:48,340
It's all right.

1008
01:38:48,923 --> 01:38:50,342
Like hell it is.

1009
01:38:51,676 --> 01:38:54,846
Run. Towards the shed.

1010
01:38:57,015 --> 01:38:58,516
I've got her.

1011
01:38:59,434 --> 01:39:00,935
Go. Now!

1012
01:39:20,163 --> 01:39:21,539
Mr. Arnold?

1013
01:39:26,878 --> 01:39:28,129
John, I'm in.

1014
01:39:28,713 --> 01:39:29,923
Great.

1015
01:39:31,216 --> 01:39:34,719
Ahead of you is a metal staircase.
Go down it.

1016
01:39:35,762 --> 01:39:38,056
Okay. Going down.

1017
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:42,727
After 20 or 30 feet
you come to a T-junction. Take a left.

1018
01:39:42,811 --> 01:39:45,980
- Have her follow the main cable.
- I know how to read a schematic.

1019
01:40:16,219 --> 01:40:18,430
I guess that means the power's off.

1020
01:40:31,693 --> 01:40:34,279
- That's not funny.
- That was great.

1021
01:40:36,781 --> 01:40:38,700
Well, maybe we, we could....

1022
01:40:56,551 --> 01:40:59,053
Damn it. Dead end.

1023
01:40:59,429 --> 01:41:00,680
Wait a minute.

1024
01:41:02,307 --> 01:41:05,560
There should have been a right turn
back there somewhere.

1025
01:41:06,519 --> 01:41:08,146
Look above you.

1026
01:41:09,022 --> 01:41:12,859
There should be a bundle of cable and
pipes all heading in the same direction.

1027
01:41:12,984 --> 01:41:14,152
Follow that.

1028
01:41:14,819 --> 01:41:16,946
Okay. Following the piping.

1029
01:41:19,616 --> 01:41:24,037
I bet I could climb over to the other
side before you could even get to the top.

1030
01:41:24,162 --> 01:41:26,498
- What would you give me?
- Respect.

1031
01:41:27,457 --> 01:41:29,501
Come on, guys, it's not a race.

1032
01:41:31,169 --> 01:41:32,378
I see the box.

1033
01:41:34,172 --> 01:41:37,175
It says, "High Voltage." Yeah.

1034
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:41,387
Okay.

1035
01:41:45,350 --> 01:41:48,019
Good. Here we go.

1036
01:41:48,686 --> 01:41:49,854
Over the top.

1037
01:41:50,522 --> 01:41:52,148
Take your time.

1038
01:41:53,149 --> 01:41:54,692
Good. Come on.

1039
01:41:54,859 --> 01:41:56,820
Find your footing.

1040
01:41:58,988 --> 01:42:01,699
You can't throw the main switch by hand.

1041
01:42:01,825 --> 01:42:05,286
You've got to pump up the primer handle
in order to get the charge.

1042
01:42:05,370 --> 01:42:07,705
It's large, flat, and gray.

1043
01:42:08,498 --> 01:42:10,416
All right, here I go. Okay?

1044
01:42:12,252 --> 01:42:17,048
One, two, three, four.

1045
01:42:17,507 --> 01:42:19,133
Okay, charged.

1046
01:42:19,843 --> 01:42:23,638
Under the words "Contact Position,"
there's a round green button...

1047
01:42:23,930 --> 01:42:26,266
which says "Push to Close."

1048
01:42:26,808 --> 01:42:28,643
Push to close.

1049
01:42:32,146 --> 01:42:33,439
Push it.

1050
01:42:48,329 --> 01:42:52,292
The red buttons turn on
the individual park systems.

1051
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:54,460
Switch them on.

1052
01:43:06,014 --> 01:43:08,224
- Get down now!
- You're gonna have to jump.

1053
01:43:08,349 --> 01:43:10,184
You crazy? I'm not gonna jump.

1054
01:43:10,226 --> 01:43:12,854
- Do what Dr. Grant says!
- Let go. I'll count to three.

1055
01:43:12,979 --> 01:43:15,356
One, two, three!

1056
01:43:16,357 --> 01:43:18,693
Four. Five.

1057
01:43:19,485 --> 01:43:21,154
I'm coming up to get you.

1058
01:43:21,279 --> 01:43:22,780
I've got to get Tim.

1059
01:43:22,947 --> 01:43:24,616
Okay. I'm gonna count to three.

1060
01:43:27,452 --> 01:43:28,703
One...

1061
01:43:30,496 --> 01:43:31,539
two....

1062
01:43:42,675 --> 01:43:44,177
He's not breathing.

1063
01:43:49,057 --> 01:43:51,476
I think we're back in business!

1064
01:43:59,692 --> 01:44:01,152
No!

1065
01:44:11,621 --> 01:44:12,997
Mr. Arnold.

1066
01:45:31,284 --> 01:45:32,452
Clever girl.

1067
01:45:56,851 --> 01:45:58,144
No, Tim!

1068
01:46:00,855 --> 01:46:02,857
Good boy.

1069
01:46:07,361 --> 01:46:08,571
Three.

1070
01:46:13,701 --> 01:46:14,786
Hello?

1071
01:46:25,004 --> 01:46:28,424
Okay. I'm gonna have to find the others.

1072
01:46:29,509 --> 01:46:32,261
Get you to a doctor.

1073
01:46:34,305 --> 01:46:36,599
- Lex, you look after Tim.
- Yeah.

1074
01:46:37,892 --> 01:46:39,852
Your hair is all sticking up.

1075
01:46:41,854 --> 01:46:44,148
Big Tim, the human piece of toast.

1076
01:46:48,444 --> 01:46:50,571
I'll be back soon. I promise.

1077
01:47:17,974 --> 01:47:19,100
Run.

1078
01:48:35,551 --> 01:48:37,511
Just the two Raptors, right?

1079
01:48:39,013 --> 01:48:40,848
You sure the third one's contained?

1080
01:48:40,932 --> 01:48:44,518
Yes, unless they figure out
how to open doors.

1081
01:49:11,170 --> 01:49:14,465
- What is it?
- It's a Velociraptor.

1082
01:49:17,134 --> 01:49:18,636
It's inside.

1083
01:49:44,161 --> 01:49:45,246
Follow me.

1084
01:52:20,818 --> 01:52:22,027
It's in there.

1085
01:52:22,903 --> 01:52:24,155
Control room.

1086
01:52:30,494 --> 01:52:33,998
- We can call for help?
- We've got to reboot the system first.

1087
01:52:36,625 --> 01:52:37,918
The door locks!

1088
01:52:38,836 --> 01:52:40,880
Ellie, boot up the door locks!

1089
01:52:50,389 --> 01:52:52,224
No, boot up the door locks!

1090
01:52:53,267 --> 01:52:57,104
- Get back! Boot up the door locks.
- You can't hold it by yourself!

1091
01:53:05,529 --> 01:53:09,033
It's a UNIX system. I know this.

1092
01:53:09,825 --> 01:53:11,869
It's all the files of the whole park.

1093
01:53:11,994 --> 01:53:15,206
It tells you everything.
I've got to find the right file.

1094
01:53:15,998 --> 01:53:17,541
Try to reach the gun.

1095
01:53:26,050 --> 01:53:28,010
I can't get it unless I move.

1096
01:53:43,734 --> 01:53:45,861
This is it. This might be the right file.

1097
01:54:02,086 --> 01:54:03,671
- You got it!
- Yes!

1098
01:54:07,132 --> 01:54:08,384
Did it!

1099
01:54:08,634 --> 01:54:09,969
Yes!

1100
01:54:14,223 --> 01:54:15,432
What works?

1101
01:54:15,516 --> 01:54:18,227
All security systems are enabled. We got it.

1102
01:54:28,070 --> 01:54:29,280
Grant.

1103
01:54:29,363 --> 01:54:32,283
Mr. Hammond, the phones are working.

1104
01:54:32,783 --> 01:54:35,494
- The children all right?
- The children are fine.

1105
01:54:35,995 --> 01:54:39,790
Call the mainland.
Tell them to send the damn helicopters.

1106
01:54:40,583 --> 01:54:42,751
It's gonna cut through the glass!

1107
01:54:45,004 --> 01:54:46,130
Grant!

1108
01:55:34,511 --> 01:55:35,679
Move!

1109
01:56:21,225 --> 01:56:23,811
Tim, let go. Yeah!

1110
01:57:41,138 --> 01:57:45,434
After careful consideration,
I've decided not to endorse your park.

1111
01:57:46,185 --> 01:57:47,603
So have I.

1112
01:58:35,192 --> 01:58:36,235
Come on.
