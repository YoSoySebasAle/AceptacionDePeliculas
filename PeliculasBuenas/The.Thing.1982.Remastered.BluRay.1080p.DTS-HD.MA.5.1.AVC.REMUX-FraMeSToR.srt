[ Blair ]: You see,
what we're talking about here

196
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:17,931
is an organism that
imitates other life-forms,

197
00:34:17,932 --> 00:34:19,974
and it imitates 'em perfectly.

198
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:23,520
When this Thing attacked our

absorb them,

200
00:34:25,648 --> 00:34:29,484
and in the process shape
its own cells to imitate them.

201
00:34:31,612 --> 00:34:36,032
This, for instance... That's not dog.

202
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,285
It's imitation.

203
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:41,996
We got to it before
it had time to finish.

00:34:44,083 --> 00:34:46,251

00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:48,711

- Yeah?

209
00:35:11,402 --> 00:35:15,113
Did you notice anything strange
about the dog, anything at all?

210
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:17,156
Strange? No.

211
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:21,077

doin' in the rec room?

00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,037
I don't know.

213
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:25,957
He was just wandering
around camp all day.

214
00:35:28,294 --> 00:35:32,422
Are you saying to me the dog wasn't
put in the kennel until last night?

215
00:35:32,423 --> 00:35:34,090
Right.

216
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:37,885
How long were you alone with that dog?

217
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:42,765
I don't know. An hour.
Hour and a half, maybe.

218
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:47,353
What the hell you lookin'
at me like that for?

219
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:51,774
- I don't know.
- What?

220
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:56,029
I don't know. It's probably nothin'.

221

It's nothin' at all.

How much more of this crap is there?

223
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:15,048
Oh, about nine hours, I'd say.

224
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:18,301
We can't learn anything from this.

225
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,762
Guess not.

226
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:32,815
[ Garry ]: Where'd they
take these shots?

227
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:36,110
Seems like they were
spendin' a lot of their time

228
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:38,821
in a little place northeast of
their camp about five or six miles.

229
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:41,240
[ Garry ]: What's that?

230
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:45,328
[ MacReady ]: It looks like
somethin' buried under the ice.

231
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:53,419
[ Norris ]: And look at that.
They're planting thermite charges.

232
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:58,383
Whatever it was it was bigger
than that block of ice you found.

233
00:37:07,393 --> 00:37:09,811
Here. This is it.

234
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:11,896
The place where they were
spendin' most of their time.

235
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:13,439
Pretty nasty out, Mac.
Thirty-five knots.

236
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:15,358
Screw it.
I'm gonna go up anyway.

237
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:40,925
Half a mile due east.

238
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:23,236
Jesus, how long do you figure
this has been in the ice?

239
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:27,406
Well, the backscatter effect's
been bringin' things up...

240
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:30,284
from way down around
here for a long time.

241
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:35,081
I'd say... I'd say the ice it's buried
in is 100,000 years old, at least.

242
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,586
- And those Norwegians blew it up?
- Yeah.

00:40:15,998 --> 00:40:19,625

and it ends up freezing in the ice.

247
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:23,671
I just cannot believe any
of this voodoo bullshit.

248
00:40:23,672 --> 00:40:27,008

Right, Mac?

00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:34,849
Do you believe any of this

I mean, they taught the
Incas everything they know.

255
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,368
Come on, now, MacReady.

256
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:57,455
The Norwegians get a hold of this,
and they dig it up out of the ice.

257
00:40:57,456 --> 00:40:59,832
Yes, Garry, they dig it up.
They cart it back.

258
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:01,375
It gets thawed out, wakes up,

259
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:03,502

From now on I want my

after thousands of years in the ice?

- I don't know how.

- Outside.
- It's 40 below outside.

All right.
Put that on and watch them.

694
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:52,324
Now I'll show you what I already know.

[ sizzles ]

696
01:21:56,954 --> 01:21:58,872
It's a crock of shit.

697
01:21:59,999 --> 01:22:02,084
Let's try the doc and Clark.

698
01:22:11,719 --> 01:22:14,096
[ sizzles ]

699
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:21,728

[ sizzles ]

701
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:33,573
Then Clark was human, huh?

702
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:35,784
Which makes you a murderer, don't it?

703
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:38,787
Palmer now.

704
01:22:44,669 --> 01:22:48,088
This is pure nonsense.
It doesn't prove a thing.

705
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:50,132
I thought you'd feel that way, Garry.

706
01:22:50,341 --> 01:22:53,051
You were the only one
that could've got to that blood.

707
01:22:53,052 --> 01:22:55,387
We'll do you last.

708
01:22:55,388 --> 01:22:57,097
[ screeches ]

709
01:22:58,391 --> 01:23:02,102
Get him away from me! MacReady, burn it!

- [ all yelling ]
- What is it?

- [ screaming ]
- [ Garry ]: Come on!

Get me outta here!

Come on, hurry up!

He's coming back! Burn it!
Burn it, for God's sake!

I know you gentlemen
have been through a lot,

737

but when you find the time,

738
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:29,184
I'd rather not spend the rest of this
winter tied to this fucking couch!

[ MacReady ]: Childs.

01:26:52,917 --> 01:26:54,668
We're goin' out to
give Blair the test.

742
01:26:54,877 --> 01:26:56,503
If he tries to make it back here

743
01:26:56,504 --> 01:26:59,339
and we're not with him... burn him.

744
01:27:19,151 --> 01:27:21,403
[ Nauls ]: Mac, the door's open!

745
01:27:36,127 --> 01:27:37,293
How'd he get out?

746
01:27:37,503 --> 01:27:39,879
The door was bolted from the outside.

747
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:48,221

01:28:24,175 --> 01:28:26,176
[ Garry ]: Blair?

01:28:29,054 --> 01:28:33,808
[ Nauls ]: Hey, Blair, you down there?
We got somethin' for ya!

750
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:47,614
[ MacReady ]: Blair's been
busy out here all by himself.

751
01:28:57,333 --> 01:29:00,835
- What is it?
- Something he's been making.

752
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:03,171
It's a ship of some kind.

753
01:29:04,423 --> 01:29:06,716
He stole the parts
from the helicopter.

754
01:29:06,926 --> 01:29:09,552
The smart S.O.B. put it
together piece by piece.

755
01:29:10,930 --> 01:29:13,014
Where was he tryin' to go?

756
01:29:14,308 --> 01:29:16,601
Any place but here.

01:29:55,683 --> 01:29:58,184
[ Nauls ]: Hey, you guys, come here.
Come here.

758
01:30:04,942 --> 01:30:08,736
I think I saw Childs outside
the main entrance of the camp.

759
01:30:08,737 --> 01:30:11,281
- What's he doin' outside?
- I don't know.

01:30:22,751 --> 01:30:24,502
Got a flare?

761
01:30:27,089 --> 01:30:29,090
He got back inside
and blew the generator.

762
01:30:32,511 --> 01:30:34,971
In six hours it'll be
a hundred below in here.

763
01:30:34,972 --> 01:30:37,015
Well, that's suicide!

764
01:30:37,725 --> 01:30:39,517
Not for that thing.

765
01:30:39,727 --> 01:30:43,313
It wants to freeze now.
It's got no way outta here.

766
01:30:43,522 --> 01:30:46,566
It just wants to go to sleep in the
cold until the rescue team finds it.

767
01:30:48,903 --> 01:30:51,571
What can we do? What can we do?

768
01:30:52,781 --> 01:30:55,825
Whether we make it or not,
we can't let that thing freeze again.

769
01:30:57,995 --> 01:31:01,623
Maybe we'll just warm things
up a little around here.

770
01:31:06,128 --> 01:31:08,212
We're not gettin' outta here alive.

771
01:31:10,841 --> 01:31:12,467
But neither is that thing.

We gotta bring this whole
place right down into the ice.

Garry, plant yours
in the old storage room.

Not the only one.

Where were you, Childs?

If we've got any surprises
for each other...

01:41:00,847 --> 01:41:03,766
I don't think we're in much
shape to do anything about it.

Well... what do we do?

810
01:41:13,610 --> 01:41:15,903
Why don't we just...

811
01:41:17,239 --> 01:41:20,157
