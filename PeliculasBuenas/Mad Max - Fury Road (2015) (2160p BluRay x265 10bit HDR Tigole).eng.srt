1
00:00:19,188 --> 00:00:20,814
<i>My name is Max.</i>

2
00:00:21,857 --> 00:00:24,276
<i>My world is fire and blood.</i>

3
00:00:25,152 --> 00:00:26,695
<i>Why are you hurting these people?</i>

4
00:00:26,946 --> 00:00:28,280
<i>It's the oil, stupid.</i>

5
00:00:28,531 --> 00:00:30,991
<i>- Oil wars.
- We are killing for guzzoline.</i>

6
00:00:31,242 --> 00:00:32,910
<i>The world is running out of water.</i>

7
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,912
<i>Now there's the water wars.</i>

8
00:00:36,622 --> 00:00:38,999
<i>Once, I was a cop.</i>

9
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,794
<i>A road warrior searching
for a righteous cause.</i>

10
00:00:42,044 --> 00:00:43,629
<i>...to the terminal freak-out point.</i>

11
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:46,966
<i>Mankind has gone rogue, terrorizing itself.</i>

12
00:00:47,216 --> 00:00:48,551
<i>Thermonuclear skirmish.</i>

13
00:00:48,801 --> 00:00:49,969
<i>The earth is sour.</i>

14
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:51,470
<i>Our bones are poisoned.</i>

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,681
<i>We have become half-life.</i>

16
00:00:54,723 --> 00:00:56,559
<i>As the world fell...</i>

17
00:00:56,809 --> 00:00:59,728
<i>...each of us, in our own way,
was broken.</i>

18
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:03,440
<i>It was hard to know
who was more crazy:</i>

19
00:01:05,401 --> 00:01:06,610
<i>Me...</i>

20
00:01:06,986 --> 00:01:08,737
<i>...or everyone else.</i>

21
00:01:11,407 --> 00:01:12,575
<i>Hello?</i>

22
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,620
<i>Where are you?</i>

23
00:01:24,044 --> 00:01:25,170
<i>Where are you, Max?</i>

24
00:01:25,421 --> 00:01:27,381
<i>- Here they come again.
- Max Rockatansky.</i>

25
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:30,801
<i>Worming their way
into the black matter of my brain.</i>

26
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:33,053
<i>- Help us, Max.
- You promised to help us.</i>

27
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:39,226
<i>I tell myself...</i>

28
00:01:39,476 --> 00:01:41,562
<i>...they cannot touch me.</i>

29
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,232
<i>They are long dead.</i>

30
00:02:43,123 --> 00:02:44,166
<i>I am the one...</i>

31
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:47,503
<i>...who runs from both
the living and the dead.</i>

32
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:50,923
<i>Hunted by scavengers.</i>

33
00:02:51,632 --> 00:02:54,468
<i>Haunted by those I could not protect.</i>

34
00:03:03,852 --> 00:03:06,355
<i>So I exist in this wasteland.</i>

35
00:03:11,402 --> 00:03:15,406
<i>A man reduced to a single instinct:</i>

36
00:03:16,156 --> 00:03:17,574
<i>Survive.</i>

37
00:04:38,071 --> 00:04:38,864
Max?

38
00:04:39,114 --> 00:04:39,990
Is that you?

39
00:04:41,158 --> 00:04:41,992
Where were you?

40
00:04:44,161 --> 00:04:46,079
Help us. Where were you?

41
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,122
Where were you, Max?

42
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:05,098
Where were you, Max?

43
00:05:05,724 --> 00:05:06,350
Stop running.

44
00:05:07,476 --> 00:05:08,519
You let us die!

45
00:05:10,062 --> 00:05:11,438
You let us die!

46
00:05:11,688 --> 00:05:12,898
You let us die!

47
00:05:13,774 --> 00:05:14,691
You promised to help us!

48
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:15,734
Why?

49
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,171
Witness!

50
00:05:38,298 --> 00:05:39,591
I got him.

51
00:06:29,141 --> 00:06:30,809
We are War Boys!

52
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:31,977
War Boys!

53
00:06:32,227 --> 00:06:34,062
Kamakrazee War Boys!

54
00:06:34,313 --> 00:06:35,105
War Boys!

55
00:06:35,355 --> 00:06:37,482
Fucacima kamakrazee...

56
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:39,026
...War Boys!

57
00:06:39,276 --> 00:06:41,236
Hooked on!

58
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:42,905
Today we're heading...

59
00:06:43,155 --> 00:06:44,489
...to Gas Town!

60
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,074
Gas Town!

61
00:06:46,325 --> 00:06:48,327
Today we're hauling Aqua Cola.

62
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:50,370
Aqua Cola!

63
00:06:50,787 --> 00:06:53,415
- Today we're hauling produce!
- Produce!

64
00:06:53,832 --> 00:06:55,083
And today we're hauling...

65
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:56,543
...Mother's Milk!

66
00:06:56,793 --> 00:06:58,295
Mother's Milk!

67
00:07:23,028 --> 00:07:26,490
<i>Joe! Joe! Joe! Immortan Joe!</i>

68
00:07:47,177 --> 00:07:49,388
Rev it up for the Immortan Joe!

69
00:07:58,647 --> 00:08:02,651
Once again, we send off my War Rig
to bring back...

70
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:05,237
...guzzoline from Gas Town...

71
00:08:05,487 --> 00:08:08,240
...and bullets from the Bullet Farm!

72
00:08:08,782 --> 00:08:12,452
Once again, I salute my Imperator...

73
00:08:12,703 --> 00:08:14,329
...Furiosa!

74
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:15,497
And I salute...

75
00:08:15,747 --> 00:08:18,375
...my half-life War Boys...

76
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,961
...who will ride with me eternal...

77
00:08:21,253 --> 00:08:23,588
...on the highways of Valhalla.

78
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:26,216
<i>V8! V8! V8! V8!</i>

79
00:08:26,466 --> 00:08:29,094
I am your redeemer.

80
00:08:29,344 --> 00:08:31,680
It is by my hand...

81
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,975
...you will rise from the ashes...

82
00:08:35,225 --> 00:08:36,184
...of this world!

83
00:08:44,568 --> 00:08:46,820
It's coming. Get ready.

84
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:51,033
Yes. Yes. Yes. It's coming.

85
00:09:47,672 --> 00:09:49,716
Do not, my friends...

86
00:09:49,966 --> 00:09:52,094
...become addicted to water.

87
00:09:52,344 --> 00:09:53,929
It will take hold of you...

88
00:09:54,262 --> 00:09:57,140
...and you will resent its absence.

89
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,500
Clear off!

90
00:10:25,168 --> 00:10:27,087
Get them all off!

91
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:28,630
Clear off!

92
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,674
Get them all off.

93
00:10:31,591 --> 00:10:33,760
Get off!

94
00:10:38,223 --> 00:10:41,184
Signal Gas Town. Convoy's on its way.

95
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:08,378
I got a War Boy...

96
00:11:08,628 --> 00:11:10,380
...running on empty.

97
00:11:10,964 --> 00:11:12,674
Hook up that full-life.

98
00:11:16,887 --> 00:11:18,930
Hey! Careful. That's a universal donor.

99
00:12:16,446 --> 00:12:18,531
Boss, we're not going to Gas Town?

100
00:12:20,992 --> 00:12:22,452
Bullet Farm?

101
00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:26,498
We're heading east.

102
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,252
I'll pass it down the line.

103
00:12:31,086 --> 00:12:32,379
New orders!

104
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:34,297
Thunder up! Thunder up!

105
00:12:34,714 --> 00:12:36,007
This is not a supply run!

106
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:37,968
Go. Go.

107
00:12:38,218 --> 00:12:40,762
- Ace, what's going on?
- Go. We're heading east.

108
00:12:41,012 --> 00:12:43,390
- Why?
- I don't know. That's the order.

109
00:13:01,408 --> 00:13:02,033
Moo.

110
00:13:02,284 --> 00:13:03,326
- Hey, Pa.
- Hmm?

111
00:13:03,576 --> 00:13:05,120
You know about this?

112
00:13:05,954 --> 00:13:08,540
Your produce ain't going to Gas Town.

113
00:13:18,174 --> 00:13:20,010
She's gone off-road...

114
00:13:20,427 --> 00:13:22,304
...into hostile territory.

115
00:13:24,472 --> 00:13:25,557
Why would she do that?

116
00:13:27,851 --> 00:13:28,476
Let me see.

117
00:13:28,727 --> 00:13:29,436
Rictus.

118
00:13:29,686 --> 00:13:31,146
- I wanna see.
- Rictus.

119
00:13:31,396 --> 00:13:33,648
Go see what's agitating Dad.

120
00:14:01,634 --> 00:14:03,219
Splendid!

121
00:14:04,387 --> 00:14:06,097
Angharad!

122
00:14:15,607 --> 00:14:16,566
Where are they?

123
00:14:16,816 --> 00:14:18,651
They are not your property.

124
00:14:18,902 --> 00:14:19,694
Miss Giddy?

125
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:21,696
You cannot own a human being.

126
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:25,158
Sooner or later someone pushes back!

127
00:14:25,408 --> 00:14:27,494
Where is she taking them?

128
00:14:27,744 --> 00:14:29,954
She didn't take them.
They begged her to go!

129
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,500
Where is she taking them?

130
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,543
A long way from you.

131
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:03,029
Hey. Hey, what's happening?

132
00:15:05,156 --> 00:15:06,324
Slit!

133
00:15:06,991 --> 00:15:08,493
What's going on? Slit!

134
00:15:08,743 --> 00:15:11,454
Treason. Betrayal.
An Imperator gone rogue.

135
00:15:11,704 --> 00:15:12,372
An Imperator.

136
00:15:12,622 --> 00:15:13,206
Who?

137
00:15:13,456 --> 00:15:16,292
Furiosa! She took a lot of stuff
from Immortan Joe.

138
00:15:16,543 --> 00:15:17,377
What stuff?

139
00:15:17,836 --> 00:15:19,754
Breeders! His prize breeders!

140
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:22,507
He wants them back!
Not a hand laid on them.

141
00:15:29,431 --> 00:15:31,391
By my deeds I honor him.

142
00:15:31,641 --> 00:15:32,725
V8.

143
00:15:36,312 --> 00:15:38,314
<i>V8! V8! V8!</i>

144
00:15:44,737 --> 00:15:45,488
That's my wheel.

145
00:15:45,738 --> 00:15:46,531
I'm driving.

146
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:47,740
You're my lancer.

147
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:49,367
I just promoted myself.

148
00:15:49,784 --> 00:15:51,161
Not today. Today is my day.

149
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:52,203
Look at you.

150
00:15:52,454 --> 00:15:54,289
If you can't stand up,
you can't do war.

151
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:55,790
He's right, son.

152
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,209
I'm not staying here dying soft.

153
00:15:58,501 --> 00:15:59,961
You're already a corpse.

154
00:16:00,211 --> 00:16:02,380
- I just need a top-up. More juice.
- No time!

155
00:16:03,131 --> 00:16:04,174
We take my Blood Bag.

156
00:16:04,424 --> 00:16:06,634
We take my Blood Bag
and strap him to the lancer's perch.

157
00:16:06,885 --> 00:16:08,428
It's got a muzzle on it. It's feral.

158
00:16:08,678 --> 00:16:09,262
That's right.

159
00:16:09,512 --> 00:16:11,723
High-octane crazy blood
filling me up.

160
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:17,687
If I'm gonna die...

161
00:16:19,105 --> 00:16:21,107
...I'm gonna die historic
on the Fury Road.

162
00:16:27,614 --> 00:16:29,532
Yeah. Yeah.

163
00:16:29,782 --> 00:16:33,036
- Organic, hitch up his Blood Bag.
- Eh?

164
00:16:33,453 --> 00:16:34,496
Right-o.

165
00:16:44,506 --> 00:16:46,174
How much more can they take from me?

166
00:16:46,424 --> 00:16:48,635
They've got my blood. Now it's my car!

167
00:17:26,714 --> 00:17:27,715
Immortan!

168
00:17:29,092 --> 00:17:30,593
Immortan Joe!

169
00:17:33,513 --> 00:17:34,931
He looked at me!

170
00:17:35,557 --> 00:17:38,434
- He looked right at me!
- He looked at your Blood Bag!

171
00:17:38,685 --> 00:17:40,979
He turned his head.
He looked me in the eye.

172
00:17:41,229 --> 00:17:43,398
He was scanning the horizon.

173
00:17:43,815 --> 00:17:44,899
No.

174
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:46,317
I am awaited.

175
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:48,945
I am awaited in Valhalla!

176
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:53,533
<i>Confucamus!</i>

177
00:17:55,952 --> 00:17:56,995
Immortan!

178
00:17:58,371 --> 00:17:59,872
Yeah!

179
00:18:19,225 --> 00:18:21,019
Hey! Heads up!

180
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:22,228
Heads up!

181
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:28,109
Boss!

182
00:18:29,068 --> 00:18:30,069
We got vehicles from the Citadel.

183
00:18:30,612 --> 00:18:31,613
They're firing flares.

184
00:18:32,238 --> 00:18:33,364
They want reinforcements
from Gas Town...

185
00:18:33,615 --> 00:18:35,199
...and the Bullet Farm.

186
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,200
What is this?

187
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:37,785
Backup? Decoy?

188
00:18:39,162 --> 00:18:40,705
It's a detour.

189
00:19:12,862 --> 00:19:13,863
Eyes right!

190
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,284
Buzzards!

191
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:21,454
- Buzzards right! Eyes on! Eyes on!
- Buzzards right!

192
00:19:21,704 --> 00:19:22,789
- Eyes on!
- Eyes on!

193
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,628
Should we turn it around
and run them into our backup?

194
00:19:30,296 --> 00:19:31,839
No! We're good!

195
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,050
We fang it!

196
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,514
Thunder up! Here we go!

197
00:19:42,642 --> 00:19:44,435
Prepare the gunners!

198
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:14,382
Morsov!

199
00:20:18,052 --> 00:20:19,011
Come on, attack!

200
00:20:31,899 --> 00:20:32,608
War!

201
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:42,702
Ready!

202
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:28,372
She's ours, Slit!

203
00:21:28,623 --> 00:21:29,248
She's ours.

204
00:21:29,499 --> 00:21:31,918
First, we get the Buzzards off her back!

205
00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:38,633
Form up!

206
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:44,180
That's my head!

207
00:22:19,507 --> 00:22:21,551
Get up! You can do it!

208
00:22:26,722 --> 00:22:27,807
Morsov!

209
00:22:29,267 --> 00:22:31,352
- Morsov!
- No!

210
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:33,312
- Witness me!
- Witness!

211
00:22:33,563 --> 00:22:34,397
Witness!

212
00:22:34,856 --> 00:22:35,731
Aah!

213
00:22:39,986 --> 00:22:41,070
Fly!

214
00:22:45,658 --> 00:22:46,367
Witness!

215
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:47,326
Witness!

216
00:22:48,995 --> 00:22:50,997
Mediocre, Morsov!

217
00:22:51,247 --> 00:22:53,457
- Mediocre!
- Hoorah!

218
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:16,606
Aah!

219
00:23:24,155 --> 00:23:24,947
Get ready!

220
00:23:26,866 --> 00:23:27,867
Back me in!

221
00:23:32,163 --> 00:23:33,247
They're coming!

222
00:23:50,973 --> 00:23:52,975
We can't breathe down there!

223
00:23:53,225 --> 00:23:54,101
Stay out of sight!

224
00:23:55,186 --> 00:23:55,811
Now!

225
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:00,441
Aah!

226
00:24:08,491 --> 00:24:09,492
Go back!

227
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:11,410
Where's he going?

228
00:24:11,661 --> 00:24:12,244
Hydraulics!

229
00:24:12,495 --> 00:24:13,454
Hydraulics!

230
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:18,167
Aah!

231
00:24:35,685 --> 00:24:36,811
Yeah.

232
00:24:41,941 --> 00:24:44,151
Now we bring home the booty.

233
00:25:10,636 --> 00:25:12,680
She thinks she can lose us, Dad.

234
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,765
She thinks we're stupid.

235
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:17,393
She thinks she can lose us in there!

236
00:25:36,162 --> 00:25:37,038
Fang it!

237
00:25:37,747 --> 00:25:39,040
Fang it!

238
00:25:45,129 --> 00:25:46,130
Why can't you stop?

239
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,133
Crew! Out of the way!

240
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:50,092
Out of the way!

241
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:51,552
What have you done?

242
00:25:51,802 --> 00:25:52,928
What have you done?

243
00:25:56,807 --> 00:25:57,391
Yeah.

244
00:26:15,076 --> 00:26:16,994
We need counterweight.
Get the Blood Bag down the back.

245
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:30,508
Hunt them down! Hunt them down!

246
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:57,326
Hey, head!

247
00:26:57,576 --> 00:26:58,744
Say bye-bye to the neck!

248
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:00,871
We're going in!

249
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:06,353
Come on! We've almost got her!

250
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,488
Come on! Hold it steady!

251
00:28:44,642 --> 00:28:45,309
Oh, what a day!

252
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:47,311
What a lovely day!

253
00:29:06,956 --> 00:29:07,539
I am the man...

254
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:10,125
...who grabs the sun...

255
00:29:12,962 --> 00:29:14,672
...riding to Valhalla!

256
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:18,133
Witness me...

257
00:29:18,384 --> 00:29:19,176
...Blood Bag!

258
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,848
Witness!

259
00:29:48,831 --> 00:29:51,000
I live, I die, I live again!

260
00:29:57,589 --> 00:29:58,590
Aah!

261
00:33:34,056 --> 00:33:35,474
We're not going back.

262
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:04,962
Water.

263
00:34:58,015 --> 00:34:58,640
Ah.

264
00:35:01,184 --> 00:35:01,810
You.

265
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:19,703
Angharad, is that just the wind...

266
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,122
...or is that a furious vexation?

267
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:25,686
Ugh!

268
00:36:51,837 --> 00:36:53,046
I got it!

269
00:37:03,223 --> 00:37:04,683
Aah!

270
00:37:34,463 --> 00:37:37,424
Glory me, Blood Bag!
We snagged her alive.

271
00:37:37,674 --> 00:37:40,010
He's gonna shred her. Shred her.

272
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,595
Bolt cutters.

273
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:43,263
Chain.

274
00:37:44,973 --> 00:37:46,099
Hey, hey!

275
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:51,396
Oh, look at them.

276
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:54,232
So shiny. So chrome.

277
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:55,942
He's gonna be so grateful.

278
00:37:56,985 --> 00:37:58,403
We could ask for anything.

279
00:37:59,488 --> 00:38:01,239
I wanna drive the War Rig.

280
00:38:02,491 --> 00:38:04,451
- What are you gonna ask for?
- That's my jacket.

281
00:38:04,701 --> 00:38:06,411
Heh, heh. Sure.

282
00:38:07,078 --> 00:38:10,248
- You can ask for more than a jacket.
- We're going to the Green Place.

283
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:12,209
Wait, it's you and me. Ugh!

284
00:38:25,847 --> 00:38:28,308
We're going to the Green Place
of Many Mothers.

285
00:38:46,868 --> 00:38:48,453
How does it feel?

286
00:38:48,703 --> 00:38:50,872
- It hurts.
- Out here, everything hurts.

287
00:38:53,959 --> 00:38:55,502
You wanna get through this?

288
00:38:59,214 --> 00:39:00,215
Do as I say.

289
00:39:05,595 --> 00:39:07,472
Now pick up what you can and run.

290
00:39:14,271 --> 00:39:15,272
Tsa!

291
00:39:50,056 --> 00:39:51,474
Kill switches.

292
00:39:53,059 --> 00:39:54,644
I set the sequence myself.

293
00:39:54,895 --> 00:39:56,813
This Rig goes nowhere without me.

294
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:01,943
You can get in.

295
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,738
Not without them.

296
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:14,331
So we wait.

297
00:40:23,214 --> 00:40:25,675
You're relying on the gratitude
of a very bad man.

298
00:40:25,926 --> 00:40:28,887
You've damaged one of his wives.
How grateful do you think he's gonna be?

299
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:39,189
You're sitting on 2000 horsepower
of nitro-boosted war machine.

300
00:40:40,148 --> 00:40:42,525
I'd say you got
about a five-minute head start.

301
00:40:50,742 --> 00:40:52,327
You want that thing off your face?

302
00:41:05,173 --> 00:41:06,216
Let's go.

303
00:41:20,814 --> 00:41:22,148
Ah, uh-uh.

304
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:54,264
Of all the legs you had to shoot,
that one was attached to his favorite.

305
00:42:14,951 --> 00:42:15,952
Smeg!

306
00:42:36,431 --> 00:42:37,974
You don't have to do it
just because he tells you.

307
00:42:38,224 --> 00:42:40,518
- What choice does she have?
- He's not gonna hurt us. He needs us.

308
00:42:40,769 --> 00:42:41,686
- Why?
- To bargain.

309
00:42:41,936 --> 00:42:42,937
Oh, he'll hurt us.

310
00:42:43,188 --> 00:42:44,939
Think he's coming to the Green Place?

311
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,232
Never! He's a crazy smeg...

312
00:42:46,483 --> 00:42:48,109
...who eats schlanger!

313
00:43:14,844 --> 00:43:15,929
Nah, stay out of there.

314
00:43:16,179 --> 00:43:17,263
Behind you.

315
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,015
Huh?

316
00:43:22,102 --> 00:43:23,561
The Gas Town Boys.

317
00:43:25,355 --> 00:43:27,190
Don't damage the goods.

318
00:43:33,696 --> 00:43:35,115
What do you see?

319
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:38,868
Big Rigs...

320
00:43:40,578 --> 00:43:41,955
...Polecats...

321
00:43:42,664 --> 00:43:43,748
...Flamers...

322
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:48,169
...and there's the People Eater himself.

323
00:43:49,295 --> 00:43:51,297
Coming to count the cost.

324
00:43:51,548 --> 00:43:52,507
Hmm.

325
00:44:03,726 --> 00:44:05,478
Aah!

326
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:09,566
We're dragging something out back.

327
00:44:09,816 --> 00:44:11,151
I think it's the fuel pod.

328
00:44:12,026 --> 00:44:12,861
No, no.

329
00:44:14,404 --> 00:44:15,113
I'll go.

330
00:45:39,322 --> 00:45:40,823
- Filth! You traitored him!
- Ah!

331
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:46,913
No unnecessary killing!

332
00:45:47,163 --> 00:45:48,957
- This War Boy wants me dead!
- We agreed!

333
00:45:49,624 --> 00:45:51,501
He's kamakrazee!

334
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,962
He's just a kid
at the end of his half-life!

335
00:45:54,212 --> 00:45:56,256
No! I live. I die. I live again!

336
00:45:57,006 --> 00:45:58,549
- Hold him!
- Tie him up!

337
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,676
Throw him out!

338
00:46:00,134 --> 00:46:01,261
Chuck him out!

339
00:46:02,387 --> 00:46:04,055
You got more friends.

340
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:07,809
Bullet Farmer.

341
00:46:08,059 --> 00:46:10,228
- They're coming from the Bullet Farm.
- Yeah?

342
00:46:11,354 --> 00:46:13,147
It's over. You can't defy him.

343
00:46:13,523 --> 00:46:14,399
Just watch us, mate!

344
00:46:14,649 --> 00:46:15,441
He is the one...

345
00:46:15,692 --> 00:46:17,819
- ...who grabbed the sun.
- Look how slick he's fooled you.

346
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:19,612
- He's a lying old man.
- By his hand...

347
00:46:19,862 --> 00:46:21,698
- ...we'll be lifted up!
- That's why we have...

348
00:46:21,948 --> 00:46:23,491
...his logo seared on our backs!

349
00:46:23,741 --> 00:46:25,368
"Breeding Stock!" "Battle Fodder!"

350
00:46:25,618 --> 00:46:26,536
No, I am awaited!

351
00:46:26,786 --> 00:46:29,080
- You're an old man's "Battle Fodder"!
- Killing everyone...

352
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:30,707
- ...and everything.
- We're not to blame!

353
00:46:31,457 --> 00:46:32,792
Then who killed the world?

354
00:47:00,945 --> 00:47:02,905
I made a deal up ahead. Safe passage.

355
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:05,491
I don't know if it's still any good.

356
00:47:06,326 --> 00:47:07,368
Get back in the hold!

357
00:47:07,618 --> 00:47:09,162
Keep the hatch open.

358
00:47:16,377 --> 00:47:17,420
I need you here.

359
00:47:19,797 --> 00:47:21,299
You may have to drive the Rig.

360
00:47:22,842 --> 00:47:24,093
Mm.

361
00:47:26,804 --> 00:47:27,472
You.

362
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:29,932
You stay.

363
00:47:31,142 --> 00:47:32,226
You stay there.

364
00:47:35,813 --> 00:47:38,191
Whatever you do, you can't be seen.

365
00:47:38,441 --> 00:47:40,234
I'm supposed to be alone.

366
00:47:40,485 --> 00:47:41,986
That was the deal.

367
00:47:48,618 --> 00:47:49,786
Down here.

368
00:48:10,681 --> 00:48:11,516
Hey.

369
00:48:12,642 --> 00:48:13,810
What's your name?

370
00:48:15,686 --> 00:48:16,687
What do I call you?

371
00:48:18,147 --> 00:48:19,273
Does it matter?

372
00:48:21,692 --> 00:48:22,735
Fine.

373
00:48:23,277 --> 00:48:24,362
When I yell "fool"...

374
00:48:24,612 --> 00:48:26,906
...you drive out of here
as fast as you can.

375
00:48:28,741 --> 00:48:30,034
This is the sequence:

376
00:48:30,868 --> 00:48:32,495
One. One, two.

377
00:48:32,745 --> 00:48:33,788
One.

378
00:48:34,455 --> 00:48:36,874
Red. Black. Go.

379
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:38,793
You have it?

380
00:50:04,337 --> 00:50:05,755
It's all here!

381
00:50:07,006 --> 00:50:09,967
Three thousand gallons of guzzoline,
just like you asked!

382
00:50:14,013 --> 00:50:15,723
I'm gonna unhitch the pod.

383
00:50:17,725 --> 00:50:19,227
You drop the rocks.

384
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,153
You said:

385
00:50:29,403 --> 00:50:30,863
"A few vehicles in pursuit.

386
00:50:31,364 --> 00:50:32,573
Maybe."

387
00:50:32,907 --> 00:50:34,033
We count three War Parties!

388
00:50:36,118 --> 00:50:37,787
Yeah, well, I got unlucky.

389
00:50:38,371 --> 00:50:39,747
Let's do this!

390
00:51:06,691 --> 00:51:07,400
Fool!

391
00:51:48,441 --> 00:51:49,775
That's our fuel!

392
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:06,500
Make way for the Ripsaw!

393
00:52:10,796 --> 00:52:11,964
Come on! Move them!

394
00:52:21,682 --> 00:52:22,808
Once I'm over...

395
00:52:23,059 --> 00:52:25,269
...clear the rocks
and bring everyone through.

396
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:26,479
Immortan!

397
00:52:27,271 --> 00:52:28,773
Immortan Joe!

398
00:52:29,023 --> 00:52:32,276
I got a War Boy!
Says he was on the War Rig.

399
00:52:34,695 --> 00:52:36,572
You! Climb aboard!

400
00:52:38,699 --> 00:52:40,076
Hey. Hey!

401
00:52:41,077 --> 00:52:42,286
I got his boot!

402
00:52:42,536 --> 00:52:44,538
I got the Blood Bag's boot!

403
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:46,457
Take me!

404
00:52:46,832 --> 00:52:48,292
I got his boot!

405
00:52:50,419 --> 00:52:52,922
All this for a family squabble.

406
00:52:53,673 --> 00:52:55,591
Healthy babies.

407
00:54:51,290 --> 00:54:51,874
Aah!

408
00:55:03,886 --> 00:55:04,845
Reload the clip.

409
00:55:05,513 --> 00:55:06,222
I can't.

410
00:55:13,437 --> 00:55:14,104
Gun!

411
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:16,607
Gimme the gun!

412
00:55:16,857 --> 00:55:17,441
Not loaded yet!

413
00:55:17,691 --> 00:55:18,317
Now!

414
00:55:18,567 --> 00:55:19,151
We had a deal!

415
00:55:21,654 --> 00:55:22,321
Ugh!

416
00:56:08,409 --> 00:56:09,618
Rictus!

417
00:56:10,077 --> 00:56:11,120
The wives!

418
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:12,705
No more flames.

419
00:56:19,378 --> 00:56:20,713
Splendid!

420
00:56:21,213 --> 00:56:22,339
Splendid!

421
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:23,465
That's my child!

422
00:56:25,175 --> 00:56:26,093
My property!

423
00:56:28,178 --> 00:56:29,013
Immorta...

424
00:56:38,731 --> 00:56:42,610
Immortan. If I get on the Rig,
there's a way inside.

425
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:44,820
- What is your name?
- It's Nux.

426
00:56:45,195 --> 00:56:47,489
I'll pike her in the spine.
Keep her breathing.

427
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:48,699
No.

428
00:56:48,949 --> 00:56:50,576
Put a bullet in her skull.

429
00:56:50,826 --> 00:56:53,537
Stop the Rig,
return my treasures to me...

430
00:56:53,913 --> 00:56:56,206
...and I, myself, will carry you...

431
00:56:56,832 --> 00:56:57,917
...to the Gates...

432
00:56:58,167 --> 00:56:59,418
...of Valhalla.

433
00:57:00,044 --> 00:57:01,170
Am I awaited?

434
00:57:02,046 --> 00:57:03,464
You will ride eternal...

435
00:57:03,923 --> 00:57:06,008
...shiny and chrome.

436
00:57:07,551 --> 00:57:08,719
Rictus!

437
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:11,055
Help him aboard!

438
00:57:13,223 --> 00:57:13,807
Ready?

439
00:57:14,475 --> 00:57:15,684
Here we go!

440
00:57:24,109 --> 00:57:25,486
Aah!

441
00:57:27,571 --> 00:57:28,238
Mediocre!

442
00:57:59,103 --> 00:58:00,104
Schlanger!

443
00:58:21,041 --> 00:58:22,543
Look out!

444
00:58:24,837 --> 00:58:25,546
Angharad!

445
00:58:26,547 --> 00:58:27,256
Get out!

446
00:58:49,028 --> 00:58:49,820
No!

447
00:58:50,362 --> 00:58:50,988
Angharad!

448
00:59:05,836 --> 00:59:08,088
Stop! Turn the Rig around!

449
00:59:09,048 --> 00:59:10,507
Go back for her!

450
00:59:11,842 --> 00:59:12,760
No.

451
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:14,511
Tell him to turn the Rig around!

452
00:59:14,762 --> 00:59:15,804
Did you see it?

453
00:59:16,346 --> 00:59:18,265
She went under the wheels.

454
00:59:18,515 --> 00:59:19,892
Did you see it?

455
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,270
She went under the wheels.

456
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,647
We keep moving.

457
00:59:25,898 --> 00:59:26,940
- No!
- We keep moving!

458
00:59:27,191 --> 00:59:29,818
He doesn't know what he's talking about!

459
00:59:30,069 --> 00:59:32,071
Whatever happens,
we're going to the Green Place.

460
00:59:32,321 --> 00:59:34,698
The stupid Green Place.
We don't even know where to find it!

461
00:59:47,336 --> 00:59:49,797
- You all right?
- On! On!

462
01:00:27,835 --> 01:00:29,044
Cheedo!

463
01:00:29,545 --> 01:00:30,963
Cheedo, don't be stupid.

464
01:00:31,213 --> 01:00:31,964
Stop!

465
01:00:32,214 --> 01:00:33,757
He'll forgive us. I know he will.

466
01:00:34,007 --> 01:00:35,175
There is no going back!

467
01:00:35,425 --> 01:00:37,094
- We were his treasures!
- Cheedo!

468
01:00:37,511 --> 01:00:40,222
We were protected! He gave us the high life!

469
01:00:40,472 --> 01:00:43,225
- What's wrong with that?
- We are not things.

470
01:00:43,475 --> 01:00:44,226
No!

471
01:00:45,644 --> 01:00:46,645
We are not things!

472
01:00:47,146 --> 01:00:48,147
We are not things.

473
01:00:48,397 --> 01:00:51,316
- I don't want to hear that again!
- They were her words!

474
01:00:51,567 --> 01:00:52,734
And now she's dead!

475
01:00:54,153 --> 01:00:55,279
Wring your hands and tear your hair...

476
01:00:55,529 --> 01:00:56,989
...but you're not going back.

477
01:00:57,447 --> 01:00:59,241
You're not going back to him.

478
01:00:59,491 --> 01:01:00,409
Angharad!

479
01:01:00,659 --> 01:01:02,536
Come on! Come on!

480
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:22,264
So, um, ahem...

481
01:01:22,598 --> 01:01:24,141
...where is this...

482
01:01:25,601 --> 01:01:27,227
...Green Place?

483
01:01:28,312 --> 01:01:30,480
It's a long night's run, heading east.

484
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,109
We need inventory.

485
01:01:34,359 --> 01:01:35,736
Match every gun with its bullets.

486
01:01:40,866 --> 01:01:42,409
I'm gonna go and do some repairs.

487
01:01:42,659 --> 01:01:44,077
We need someone down the back.

488
01:01:44,328 --> 01:01:45,078
I'll go.

489
01:01:45,329 --> 01:01:46,038
No.

490
01:01:46,288 --> 01:01:48,040
I want you to stay together.

491
01:01:48,624 --> 01:01:49,875
I can do it.

492
01:02:22,991 --> 01:02:24,201
What are you doing here?

493
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,870
He saw it.

494
01:02:27,454 --> 01:02:28,872
He saw it all.

495
01:02:30,290 --> 01:02:32,793
My own Blood Bag driving the Rig
that killed her.

496
01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:41,760
Stop doing that.

497
01:02:43,095 --> 01:02:45,097
Shh. Shh, shh, shh.

498
01:02:45,347 --> 01:02:46,431
Stop.

499
01:02:56,566 --> 01:02:59,361
Three times the gates were open to me.

500
01:02:59,653 --> 01:03:00,654
What gates?

501
01:03:01,363 --> 01:03:03,156
I was awaited in Valhalla.

502
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:04,992
They were calling my name.

503
01:03:05,784 --> 01:03:09,538
I should be walking with the Immorta.
McFeasting with the heroes of all time.

504
01:03:12,916 --> 01:03:15,961
I'd say it was your manifest destiny not to.

505
01:03:17,796 --> 01:03:20,465
I thought I was being spared
for something great.

506
01:03:20,716 --> 01:03:24,177
I got to drive a pursuit vehicle.

507
01:03:25,012 --> 01:03:28,140
For a while even Larry and Barry
stopped chewing on my windpipe.

508
01:03:28,515 --> 01:03:30,183
Who are Larry and Barry?

509
01:03:31,059 --> 01:03:32,311
My mates.

510
01:03:32,853 --> 01:03:34,146
Larry and Barry.

511
01:03:36,189 --> 01:03:38,775
If they don't get me,
then the Night Fevers will.

512
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:07,095
Well, we've only got four for Big Boy here,
so he's all but useless.

513
01:04:08,555 --> 01:04:09,639
But...

514
01:04:09,890 --> 01:04:13,894
...we can squirt off this little pinky
a raunchy 29 times.

515
01:04:16,313 --> 01:04:18,440
Angharad used to call them Antiseed.

516
01:04:19,191 --> 01:04:21,610
Plant one and watch something die.

517
01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:39,438
Hold on, mate.

518
01:05:56,872 --> 01:06:00,000
We are down
30,000 units of guzzoline...

519
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:03,128
...19 canisters of nitro, 12 assault bikes...

520
01:06:04,212 --> 01:06:04,880
...seven pursuit vehicles.

521
01:06:05,881 --> 01:06:07,007
The deficit mounts.

522
01:06:07,257 --> 01:06:08,341
And now, sir...

523
01:06:08,633 --> 01:06:11,553
...you have us stuck in a quagmire.

524
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:13,263
Hey, Joe!

525
01:06:14,181 --> 01:06:15,265
Boss!

526
01:06:17,309 --> 01:06:19,519
Your girly's breathing her last!

527
01:06:20,145 --> 01:06:22,063
What about the child?

528
01:06:31,281 --> 01:06:32,782
Are you coming, brother?

529
01:06:33,033 --> 01:06:34,117
Wait!

530
01:06:35,243 --> 01:06:36,953
It's gone awful quiet in there.

531
01:06:37,204 --> 01:06:38,371
Get it out.

532
01:06:38,622 --> 01:06:39,873
Get it out!

533
01:06:42,709 --> 01:06:44,836
Come on! I've been called to the torture!

534
01:06:45,587 --> 01:06:46,588
Patience!

535
01:06:48,381 --> 01:06:50,884
Oh, you stay here with your grief, Daddy.

536
01:06:51,134 --> 01:06:54,304
- I'll fetch them for you.
- Be careful! Protect the assets!

537
01:06:56,932 --> 01:06:59,184
Just one angry shot...

538
01:06:59,809 --> 01:07:01,478
...for Furiosa.

539
01:07:01,728 --> 01:07:02,687
Hut!

540
01:07:02,938 --> 01:07:03,897
Yeah!

541
01:07:10,195 --> 01:07:12,656
Crying shame. Heh.

542
01:07:12,906 --> 01:07:14,032
Come.

543
01:07:15,158 --> 01:07:16,034
Another month...

544
01:07:16,993 --> 01:07:18,828
...could have been your viable human!

545
01:07:19,079 --> 01:07:20,413
Was it a male?

546
01:07:20,664 --> 01:07:22,249
Your A-1 Alpha prime.

547
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:26,753
Hey, Rictus!

548
01:07:28,088 --> 01:07:29,798
You lost a baby brother!

549
01:07:32,259 --> 01:07:34,010
Perfect in every way.

550
01:07:36,805 --> 01:07:38,348
I had a baby brother!

551
01:07:38,765 --> 01:07:40,725
I had a little baby brother!

552
01:07:40,976 --> 01:07:42,769
And he was perfect!

553
01:07:43,019 --> 01:07:44,896
Perfect in every way!

554
01:08:15,635 --> 01:08:16,761
Come on.

555
01:08:26,104 --> 01:08:27,856
Wouldn't wanna shoot the wives, sir.

556
01:08:28,106 --> 01:08:29,190
Just probing.

557
01:08:40,535 --> 01:08:42,120
He wants to help!

558
01:08:42,370 --> 01:08:43,163
Who?

559
01:08:43,413 --> 01:08:44,748
The War Boy!

560
01:08:44,998 --> 01:08:46,416
Where did he come from?

561
01:08:46,666 --> 01:08:48,001
I thought we threw him off the Rig!

562
01:08:52,505 --> 01:08:53,506
There's high ground...

563
01:08:53,757 --> 01:08:55,634
- ...just beyond that thing.
- He means the tree.

564
01:08:55,967 --> 01:08:57,552
Yeah. Tree!

565
01:08:59,054 --> 01:08:59,804
Leave him to me.

566
01:09:00,055 --> 01:09:03,558
Say, anyone notice that bright light?
Encroaching gunfire?

567
01:09:04,184 --> 01:09:04,934
Get out.

568
01:09:05,185 --> 01:09:06,311
I can do this. I know this machine.

569
01:09:06,561 --> 01:09:08,146
He does. He's a Revhead.

570
01:09:13,735 --> 01:09:14,736
You've got two left!

571
01:09:21,117 --> 01:09:22,243
On him.

572
01:09:39,886 --> 01:09:41,471
Don't breathe.

573
01:09:42,430 --> 01:09:43,723
Ugh!

574
01:09:45,433 --> 01:09:46,017
Hey!

575
01:09:46,267 --> 01:09:47,602
Hey! Hey!

576
01:09:47,852 --> 01:09:48,853
War Boy!

577
01:09:49,104 --> 01:09:51,690
I'm gonna use the winch
around the tree thing!

578
01:09:52,649 --> 01:09:53,775
Take this.

579
01:09:54,025 --> 01:09:55,735
Let's get the engine plates.

580
01:09:56,986 --> 01:09:57,946
You drive the Rig!

581
01:09:58,196 --> 01:10:00,031
- Hold up a flare!
- I am holding a flare!

582
01:10:00,824 --> 01:10:03,201
- Closer!
- It's right in front of your eyes!

583
01:10:04,244 --> 01:10:05,203
Aah!

584
01:10:15,547 --> 01:10:17,257
Hut! Hut!

585
01:10:23,638 --> 01:10:24,848
Blood Bag!

586
01:10:31,312 --> 01:10:33,690
I am the scales of justice!

587
01:10:34,023 --> 01:10:36,526
Conductor of the choir of death!

588
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:39,404
Sing, Brother Heckler.

589
01:10:41,072 --> 01:10:42,657
Sing, Brother Koch!

590
01:10:45,618 --> 01:10:49,164
Sing, brothers, sing! Sing!

591
01:10:50,290 --> 01:10:51,332
Don't they know they're shooting at us?

592
01:11:06,389 --> 01:11:07,557
Gun fever!

593
01:12:17,836 --> 01:12:20,129
I never thought I'd do something
as shine as that.

594
01:12:20,672 --> 01:12:22,131
How are the engines?

595
01:12:22,799 --> 01:12:24,217
Very hot and real thirsty.

596
01:12:29,097 --> 01:12:33,101
Hey. You need to take the War Rig
half a klick down the track.

597
01:12:34,269 --> 01:12:37,188
What if you're not back by the time
the engines have cooled?

598
01:12:39,357 --> 01:12:40,942
Well, you keep moving.

599
01:12:50,368 --> 01:12:52,412
What do you suppose he's gonna do?

600
01:12:53,496 --> 01:12:55,039
Retaliate first.

601
01:12:58,418 --> 01:12:59,627
Let's go!

602
01:14:19,415 --> 01:14:22,001
- Are you hurt?
- Huh?

603
01:14:22,251 --> 01:14:23,461
You're bleeding.

604
01:14:24,170 --> 01:14:25,672
That's not his blood.

605
01:14:27,465 --> 01:14:28,841
What is this?

606
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:30,927
It's Mother's Milk.

607
01:15:13,469 --> 01:15:14,470
It's okay.

608
01:15:14,721 --> 01:15:15,763
Sleep.

609
01:15:16,973 --> 01:15:18,474
Get some rest.

610
01:15:28,943 --> 01:15:31,529
How do you know this place even exists?

611
01:15:34,198 --> 01:15:35,700
I was born there.

612
01:15:37,994 --> 01:15:39,078
So why'd you leave?

613
01:15:39,495 --> 01:15:40,663
I didn't.

614
01:15:42,248 --> 01:15:44,167
I was taken as a child.

615
01:15:45,918 --> 01:15:47,045
Stolen.

616
01:15:53,092 --> 01:15:54,802
You done this before?

617
01:15:55,470 --> 01:15:56,846
Many times.

618
01:15:57,847 --> 01:16:00,141
Now that I drive a War Rig...

619
01:16:01,726 --> 01:16:03,895
...this is the best shot I'll ever have.

620
01:16:04,979 --> 01:16:06,147
And them?

621
01:16:08,066 --> 01:16:09,692
They're looking for hope.

622
01:16:10,735 --> 01:16:12,111
What about you?

623
01:16:17,575 --> 01:16:18,868
Redemption.

624
01:17:02,328 --> 01:17:04,747
Hey, what's that?

625
01:17:17,343 --> 01:17:19,470
I remember something like that.

626
01:17:31,732 --> 01:17:33,276
Help me!

627
01:17:36,362 --> 01:17:37,947
Help me!

628
01:17:41,450 --> 01:17:42,743
- Help me, please!
- Uh, uh.

629
01:17:42,994 --> 01:17:44,245
Please!

630
01:17:44,954 --> 01:17:46,080
That's bait.

631
01:17:47,540 --> 01:17:48,916
Stay in the Rig.

632
01:17:54,172 --> 01:17:57,049
Hurry! Please, hurry! They'll be back!

633
01:17:58,467 --> 01:17:59,302
I am one of...

634
01:17:59,552 --> 01:18:00,803
...the Vuvalini!

635
01:18:01,762 --> 01:18:03,556
Of the Many Mothers!

636
01:18:05,141 --> 01:18:08,352
My Initiate Mother was K.T. Concannon!

637
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:12,190
I am the daughter of Mary Jabassa.

638
01:18:13,399 --> 01:18:16,235
My clan was Swaddle Dog!

639
01:19:03,449 --> 01:19:04,742
It's me.

640
01:19:12,792 --> 01:19:14,543
There's something in the eyes.

641
01:19:15,086 --> 01:19:17,171
Perhaps it is Jabassa's child.

642
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:23,177
This is our Furiosa.

643
01:19:26,722 --> 01:19:28,099
How long has it been?

644
01:19:29,725 --> 01:19:31,102
Seven thousand days.

645
01:19:31,727 --> 01:19:33,813
Plus the ones I don't remember.

646
01:19:35,231 --> 01:19:36,274
Furiosa.

647
01:19:37,692 --> 01:19:39,360
What happened to your mother?

648
01:19:40,820 --> 01:19:42,154
She died.

649
01:19:42,989 --> 01:19:44,657
On the third day.

650
01:19:51,831 --> 01:19:52,915
From where did you come?

651
01:19:53,291 --> 01:19:57,003
The West. Citadel. Beyond the mountains.

652
01:20:01,299 --> 01:20:01,924
The men.

653
01:20:02,174 --> 01:20:03,342
Who are they?

654
01:20:03,592 --> 01:20:04,927
They're reliable.

655
01:20:05,344 --> 01:20:07,013
They helped us get here.

656
01:20:18,899 --> 01:20:21,110
Where did you find such creatures?

657
01:20:23,696 --> 01:20:24,989
So soft.

658
01:20:25,698 --> 01:20:27,116
This one has all her teeth!

659
01:20:32,663 --> 01:20:33,789
Oh.

660
01:20:36,208 --> 01:20:38,336
I can't wait for them to see it.

661
01:20:38,961 --> 01:20:40,087
See?

662
01:20:41,255 --> 01:20:42,506
See what?

663
01:20:42,757 --> 01:20:44,008
Home.

664
01:20:48,012 --> 01:20:49,513
The Green Place.

665
01:20:49,764 --> 01:20:51,891
But if you came from the West...

666
01:20:52,933 --> 01:20:54,477
...you passed it.

667
01:20:55,811 --> 01:20:57,271
The crows.

668
01:20:57,563 --> 01:21:00,066
The creepy place with all the crows.

669
01:21:01,150 --> 01:21:02,485
- The soil.
- We had to get out.

670
01:21:02,735 --> 01:21:04,528
- We had no water.
- The water was filth.

671
01:21:04,779 --> 01:21:06,405
It was poisoned. It was sour.

672
01:21:06,655 --> 01:21:08,032
And then the crows came.

673
01:21:08,282 --> 01:21:10,034
We couldn't grow anything.

674
01:21:10,284 --> 01:21:11,619
Where are the others?

675
01:21:11,869 --> 01:21:12,828
What others?

676
01:21:13,079 --> 01:21:14,246
The Many Mothers.

677
01:21:14,497 --> 01:21:15,998
We're the only ones left.

678
01:22:16,934 --> 01:22:18,060
Look.

679
01:22:20,771 --> 01:22:23,023
That's what you call a satellite.

680
01:22:23,774 --> 01:22:26,026
Miss Giddy told us about those.

681
01:22:26,610 --> 01:22:29,447
They used to bounce messages
across the Earth.

682
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:31,782
Shows.

683
01:22:32,032 --> 01:22:34,326
Everyone in the old world
had a show.

684
01:22:36,662 --> 01:22:37,496
Do you think there's still...

685
01:22:37,746 --> 01:22:39,039
...somebody out there?

686
01:22:40,249 --> 01:22:41,792
Sending shows?

687
01:22:42,084 --> 01:22:43,419
Who knows?

688
01:22:44,545 --> 01:22:46,797
Those are the Plains of Silence.

689
01:22:49,425 --> 01:22:51,469
Stay right where you are, little Joe.

690
01:22:51,719 --> 01:22:53,846
Kind of lost its novelty out here.

691
01:22:54,096 --> 01:22:55,681
You having a baby?

692
01:22:56,765 --> 01:22:58,225
Warlord Junior.

693
01:22:58,476 --> 01:22:59,727
Gonna be so ugly.

694
01:23:00,352 --> 01:23:01,770
It could be a girl.

695
01:23:03,647 --> 01:23:05,232
You kill people with that, do you?

696
01:23:05,524 --> 01:23:07,568
Killed everyone I ever met out here.

697
01:23:07,818 --> 01:23:10,154
Headshots. All of them.
Snap. Right in the medulla.

698
01:23:10,404 --> 01:23:12,364
Thought somehow you girls
were above that.

699
01:23:16,994 --> 01:23:18,162
Come here.

700
01:23:25,878 --> 01:23:26,879
Take a peek.

701
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:29,131
Seeds.

702
01:23:30,132 --> 01:23:31,592
These are from home.

703
01:23:31,842 --> 01:23:34,011
Heirlooms. The real thing.

704
01:23:34,678 --> 01:23:36,514
I plant one every chance I get.

705
01:23:36,764 --> 01:23:37,765
Where?

706
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:41,060
So far, nothing's took.
Earth's too sour.

707
01:23:41,393 --> 01:23:43,145
Aah. So many different kinds.

708
01:23:43,437 --> 01:23:45,481
Trees, flowers, fruit.

709
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:48,567
Back then, everyone had their fill.

710
01:23:49,276 --> 01:23:51,487
Back then,
there was no need to snap anybody.

711
01:24:07,127 --> 01:24:07,962
Can I talk to you?

712
01:24:28,190 --> 01:24:30,109
I've talked with the others.

713
01:24:36,907 --> 01:24:40,160
We're never gonna have a better chance
to make it across the salt.

714
01:24:42,329 --> 01:24:46,333
If we leave the Rig here, and load the
motorcycles up with as much as we can...

715
01:24:46,584 --> 01:24:49,086
...we can maybe ride for 160 days.

716
01:24:51,797 --> 01:24:53,757
One of those bikes is yours.

717
01:24:54,883 --> 01:24:56,135
Fully loaded.

718
01:24:59,263 --> 01:25:01,432
You're more than welcome
to come with us.

719
01:25:05,436 --> 01:25:07,396
I'll make my own way.

720
01:25:14,069 --> 01:25:16,155
You know, hope is a mistake.

721
01:25:23,037 --> 01:25:26,332
If you can't fix what's broken, you'll, uh...

722
01:25:28,292 --> 01:25:29,877
You'll go insane.

723
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:47,686
<i>Where are you, Max?</i>

724
01:25:49,730 --> 01:25:51,023
<i>Where are you?</i>

725
01:25:52,650 --> 01:25:54,693
<i>Help us. You promised to help us.</i>

726
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:07,373
<i>Come on, Pa! Let's go.</i>

727
01:26:39,321 --> 01:26:40,406
All right.

728
01:26:41,740 --> 01:26:43,909
This is your way home.

729
01:26:47,413 --> 01:26:48,455
We go back?

730
01:26:48,914 --> 01:26:50,457
Mm.

731
01:26:50,708 --> 01:26:52,501
- Back?
- Yeah.

732
01:26:52,751 --> 01:26:54,461
I thought you weren't insane anymore.

733
01:26:54,712 --> 01:26:55,921
What are they saying?

734
01:26:56,171 --> 01:26:58,382
He wants to go back from where they came.

735
01:26:58,632 --> 01:26:59,800
The Citadel.

736
01:27:00,551 --> 01:27:02,219
What's there to find at the Citadel?

737
01:27:02,970 --> 01:27:04,179
Green.

738
01:27:04,430 --> 01:27:05,764
And water.

739
01:27:07,015 --> 01:27:10,894
There's a ridiculous amount of clear water.
And a lot of crops.

740
01:27:11,145 --> 01:27:13,564
Got everything you need.
Long as you're not afraid of heights.

741
01:27:13,814 --> 01:27:14,940
Where does the water come from?

742
01:27:15,190 --> 01:27:18,861
He pumps it up from deep in the earth.
Calls it Aqua Cola and claims it for himself.

743
01:27:19,111 --> 01:27:21,363
And because he owns it, he owns all of us.

744
01:27:21,613 --> 01:27:22,781
I don't like him already.

745
01:27:23,031 --> 01:27:25,409
It'll take two weeks
to skirt the Wall of Mountains.

746
01:27:25,659 --> 01:27:26,577
No.

747
01:27:26,827 --> 01:27:29,538
I suggest we go back the same way we came.

748
01:27:31,081 --> 01:27:32,666
Through the canyon.

749
01:27:33,709 --> 01:27:37,588
It's open. We know that. Right?
He brought all his war parties through.

750
01:27:38,088 --> 01:27:41,467
So we take the War Rig and we charge it
right through the middle of them.

751
01:27:41,717 --> 01:27:42,718
We can decouple the tanker...

752
01:27:42,968 --> 01:27:44,219
...at the pass.

753
01:27:44,595 --> 01:27:46,096
Shut it off behind us.

754
01:27:46,346 --> 01:27:47,473
Kaboom.

755
01:27:50,309 --> 01:27:52,853
And how exactly do we take the Citadel?

756
01:27:53,395 --> 01:27:55,189
Assuming we're still alive by then.

757
01:27:55,439 --> 01:27:58,025
If we can block the pass, it'll be easy.

758
01:27:58,275 --> 01:28:02,029
All that's left are his War Pups
and War Boys too sick to fight.

759
01:28:02,738 --> 01:28:04,490
And we'll be with Nux.

760
01:28:05,157 --> 01:28:06,366
He's a War Boy.

761
01:28:06,617 --> 01:28:09,244
He'll be bringing us home.
Bringing back what's stolen, as he's meant to.

762
01:28:12,664 --> 01:28:13,832
Yeah.

763
01:28:14,792 --> 01:28:16,376
It feels like hope.

764
01:28:17,586 --> 01:28:19,129
I like this plan.

765
01:28:19,713 --> 01:28:20,714
We can start again.

766
01:28:21,381 --> 01:28:23,050
Just like the old days!

767
01:28:24,635 --> 01:28:25,844
Look.

768
01:28:26,553 --> 01:28:28,263
It'll be a hard day.

769
01:28:28,722 --> 01:28:31,809
But I guarantee you
that a 160 days' ride that way...

770
01:28:34,144 --> 01:28:36,188
...there's nothing but salt.

771
01:28:38,649 --> 01:28:41,527
At least that way, you know,
we might be able to...

772
01:28:43,028 --> 01:28:44,279
...together...

773
01:28:45,864 --> 01:28:47,950
...come across some kind of redemption.

774
01:29:18,730 --> 01:29:20,107
War Rig!

775
01:29:20,399 --> 01:29:22,317
That's the War Rig!

776
01:29:32,327 --> 01:29:33,537
That's them.

777
01:29:33,787 --> 01:29:35,038
Why are they going back?

778
01:29:35,497 --> 01:29:37,165
Do they wish to surrender?

779
01:29:37,875 --> 01:29:39,376
They are heading for the canyon.

780
01:29:41,253 --> 01:29:44,214
They're going back to the Citadel!

781
01:29:44,464 --> 01:29:46,133
They know it's undefended!

782
01:29:46,383 --> 01:29:47,467
Bollocks!

783
01:29:48,844 --> 01:29:49,970
Roll up!

784
01:30:00,272 --> 01:30:01,523
Go!

785
01:30:23,879 --> 01:30:25,380
- What are you doing?
- Praying.

786
01:30:25,631 --> 01:30:26,590
To who?

787
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:28,300
Anyone that's listening.

788
01:30:52,699 --> 01:30:53,659
Here we go, girls!

789
01:30:56,328 --> 01:30:57,579
That's mine!

790
01:31:01,959 --> 01:31:03,919
He'll try to get in front of us.
Spike our wheels.

791
01:31:11,218 --> 01:31:12,260
Don't blow my engine.

792
01:31:12,803 --> 01:31:13,804
Gonna nudge him.

793
01:31:14,054 --> 01:31:15,138
Just a little.

794
01:31:28,110 --> 01:31:31,071
You filth! You traitored him!

795
01:31:35,951 --> 01:31:36,743
Yeah!

796
01:31:55,095 --> 01:31:55,804
Go.

797
01:31:57,848 --> 01:31:59,391
Aah! Aah!

798
01:32:09,401 --> 01:32:10,527
Ha!

799
01:32:11,528 --> 01:32:12,195
Aah!

800
01:32:22,289 --> 01:32:22,873
Gotta back off.

801
01:32:23,999 --> 01:32:26,418
Engine one is gone.
Two's about to blow.

802
01:32:26,668 --> 01:32:27,252
Right.

803
01:32:28,170 --> 01:32:29,087
Are you a Black Thumb?

804
01:32:29,337 --> 01:32:30,380
Uh-huh.

805
01:32:30,630 --> 01:32:31,882
All right. Engine one. Now.

806
01:32:32,132 --> 01:32:33,467
You and me. Fifth wheel.

807
01:32:33,884 --> 01:32:35,010
We'll unhook the tanker.

808
01:32:47,647 --> 01:32:48,565
One man, one bullet.

809
01:33:06,541 --> 01:33:08,168
- I cannot see.
- Maadi! Maadi!

810
01:33:08,418 --> 01:33:09,586
I can't see.

811
01:33:29,606 --> 01:33:30,398
Oh.

812
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:49,960
Hey!

813
01:33:50,210 --> 01:33:51,711
Harpoons and plows!

814
01:33:52,129 --> 01:33:53,338
They're hauling us back!

815
01:34:04,599 --> 01:34:06,810
Leave three bolts. Three.

816
01:35:25,347 --> 01:35:26,097
Hey, you! Aargh!

817
01:35:41,988 --> 01:35:43,281
Are you okay?

818
01:35:45,992 --> 01:35:47,619
I think she's hurt.

819
01:36:11,476 --> 01:36:12,269
Hey!

820
01:36:38,628 --> 01:36:39,212
No!

821
01:36:43,591 --> 01:36:44,551
No!

822
01:36:49,389 --> 01:36:50,724
<i>Hey.</i>

823
01:36:51,266 --> 01:36:51,933
<i>Stay with me.</i>

824
01:36:52,517 --> 01:36:54,269
<i>- Stay with me.</i>
- Stay with me.

825
01:36:54,519 --> 01:36:55,895
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Hey! Are you there?

826
01:36:57,772 --> 01:36:58,732
You finish that! I'll finish her!

827
01:37:07,407 --> 01:37:08,074
Unh!

828
01:38:29,614 --> 01:38:30,240
Valhalla!

829
01:38:44,838 --> 01:38:46,005
Aah!

830
01:38:51,970 --> 01:38:52,554
Ha!

831
01:39:11,322 --> 01:39:12,157
Engine one's good.

832
01:39:13,283 --> 01:39:14,451
For now.

833
01:40:02,665 --> 01:40:04,083
She's hurt! She's hurt...

834
01:40:04,334 --> 01:40:05,376
...real bad!

835
01:40:26,814 --> 01:40:27,482
Aah!

836
01:41:35,758 --> 01:41:36,426
You hear that?

837
01:41:37,427 --> 01:41:39,012
We're gonna see two airborne V8s.

838
01:41:40,555 --> 01:41:42,265
I'm gonna need you to drive.

839
01:41:44,475 --> 01:41:46,144
I'll get him out of our way.

840
01:42:53,169 --> 01:42:54,462
Rictus!

841
01:42:55,546 --> 01:42:56,381
Take me!

842
01:43:09,977 --> 01:43:10,728
Cheedo!

843
01:43:10,978 --> 01:43:12,522
- What are you doing?
- Good girl.

844
01:43:16,859 --> 01:43:17,985
- Come here.
- Aah!

845
01:43:20,279 --> 01:43:21,572
Aah!

846
01:43:23,408 --> 01:43:24,283
Big Boy!

847
01:43:25,368 --> 01:43:27,036
Aah!

848
01:43:30,540 --> 01:43:32,375
Here! Here!

849
01:43:50,643 --> 01:43:51,227
Unh!

850
01:44:26,262 --> 01:44:27,430
Remember me?

851
01:44:30,266 --> 01:44:31,100
Aah!

852
01:44:48,785 --> 01:44:49,827
He's dead!

853
01:44:50,661 --> 01:44:51,829
He's dead.

854
01:45:10,848 --> 01:45:13,810
When you're across safe,
I'll jam the throttle and follow you.

855
01:45:14,602 --> 01:45:15,645
Come on!

856
01:45:16,729 --> 01:45:19,273
Hurry! We're nearly at the pass.

857
01:46:06,904 --> 01:46:08,489
Witness me.

858
01:46:14,954 --> 01:46:15,955
Rictus!

859
01:47:11,552 --> 01:47:13,179
Why is she making that noise?

860
01:47:13,429 --> 01:47:15,139
She's pumping air into her chest cavity.

861
01:47:16,015 --> 01:47:17,558
She's collapsing her lungs...

862
01:47:17,808 --> 01:47:19,602
...one breath at a time.

863
01:47:25,358 --> 01:47:26,525
I know.

864
01:47:29,487 --> 01:47:30,947
I am so sorry.

865
01:47:33,699 --> 01:47:34,951
I know. I know.

866
01:47:36,202 --> 01:47:37,536
Hold it there.

867
01:47:38,412 --> 01:47:39,497
All right.

868
01:47:40,039 --> 01:47:42,875
Put that on there. Press it in. Hey.

869
01:47:44,251 --> 01:47:44,919
Hey.

870
01:47:45,169 --> 01:47:46,295
Home.

871
01:47:53,594 --> 01:47:54,929
Home.

872
01:48:01,352 --> 01:48:03,396
- No, no, no. No, no, no.
- She's exsanguinated.

873
01:48:03,646 --> 01:48:04,939
- Drained all her blood.
- Well...

874
01:48:06,524 --> 01:48:07,608
Hold these.

875
01:48:08,442 --> 01:48:09,026
We need that.

876
01:48:10,361 --> 01:48:11,529
Needle.

877
01:48:12,530 --> 01:48:13,406
Come on.

878
01:48:14,824 --> 01:48:15,491
Take this.

879
01:48:18,661 --> 01:48:19,453
Keep her awake.

880
01:48:20,371 --> 01:48:21,622
Furiosa.

881
01:48:25,292 --> 01:48:27,461
Okay, that's not retracting.

882
01:48:28,129 --> 01:48:29,338
There we go.

883
01:48:30,214 --> 01:48:32,133
All right, hold it up. Hold it up.

884
01:48:33,718 --> 01:48:34,885
All right.

885
01:48:35,261 --> 01:48:35,928
Sorry.

886
01:48:38,347 --> 01:48:40,808
There you go. Okay. There you go.

887
01:48:53,320 --> 01:48:54,530
Max.

888
01:48:55,865 --> 01:48:57,366
My name is Max.

889
01:48:58,868 --> 01:49:01,412
Yeah. Mm-hm.

890
01:49:01,746 --> 01:49:03,164
Mm.

891
01:49:06,125 --> 01:49:07,710
That's my name.

892
01:49:49,585 --> 01:49:50,252
Brake!

893
01:49:56,133 --> 01:49:57,259
Reveal yourself.

894
01:50:16,403 --> 01:50:17,696
He's got something.

895
01:50:24,995 --> 01:50:25,913
It's Immortan Joe.

896
01:50:26,664 --> 01:50:28,082
The Immortan Joe is dead!

897
01:50:55,276 --> 01:50:56,527
Furiosa!

898
01:50:56,819 --> 01:50:57,987
Furiosa!

899
01:50:58,237 --> 01:50:59,321
Furiosa!

900
01:50:59,572 --> 01:51:00,698
Furiosa!

901
01:51:01,657 --> 01:51:02,867
Furiosa!

902
01:51:03,242 --> 01:51:04,660
She's back.

903
01:51:04,910 --> 01:51:07,496
<i>Let them up! Let them up!</i>

904
01:51:07,746 --> 01:51:09,206
<i>Let them up!</i>

905
01:51:09,456 --> 01:51:11,500
<i>Let them up! Let them up!</i>

906
01:51:14,879 --> 01:51:15,921
Come on, let's do it!

907
01:51:16,172 --> 01:51:17,673
Let them up. Come on.

908
01:51:50,206 --> 01:51:51,498
Come on.
