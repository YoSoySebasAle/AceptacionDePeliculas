Sunrise
A Song of Two Humans

2
00:01:38,444 --> 00:01:45,379
This song of the Man and his Wife
is of no place and every place:

3
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:54,661
you might hear it anywhere at any time.

4
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:59,934
For wherever the sun rises
and sets in the city's turmoil or

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,310
under the open sky on the farm

6
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:17,678
life is much the same:
sometimes bitter, sometimes sweet

7
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:26,913
Summertime... vacation time

8
00:04:00,915 --> 00:04:05,915
Among the vacationists was
a Woman of the City.

9
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:12,663
Several weeks had passed since her coming
and still she lingered.

10
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:59,827
"They used to be like children, carefree...
always happy and laughing..."

11
00:09:24,087 --> 00:09:29,013
"They used to be like children, carefree...
always happy and laughing..."

12
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:41,076
"Now he ruins himself for that woman from the city -
Money-lenders strip the farm - "

13
00:09:54,609 --> 00:09:59,051
"Now he ruins himself for that woman from the city -
Money-lenders strip the farm -

14
00:09:59,051 --> 00:10:04,797
and his wife sits alone."

15
00:12:35,638 --> 00:12:38,793
"Tell me!
You are all mine?"

16
00:12:53,464 --> 00:12:57,783
"Sell your farm...
come with me to the City."

17
00:13:05,766 --> 00:13:07,891
"...and my wife?"

18
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:30,332
"Couldn't she get drowned?

19
00:13:35,868 --> 00:13:41,124
"...then overturn the boat...
it will look like an accident."

20
00:14:05,707 --> 00:14:08,493
"Leave this behind...
come to the City!"

21
00:14:09,496 --> 00:14:13,559
"Come to the City!"

22
00:15:50,128 --> 00:15:55,401
"...after the boat has capsized,
save yourself with these bulrushes."

23
00:15:58,642 --> 00:16:01,142
"The rushes will hold you up.

24
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:06,741
Scatter them before you reach the shore
and tell everyone she drowned by accident."

25
00:22:32,632 --> 00:22:39,126
"We're going for a trip across the water.
I may not be back for quite a while."

26
00:31:11,682 --> 00:31:14,946
"Don't be afraid of me!"

27
00:33:56,608 --> 00:33:59,948
"Don't be afraid of me!"

28
00:40:35,118 --> 00:40:40,080
"God is giving you,
in the holy blonds of matrimony, a trust.

29
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:44,951
She is young... and inexperienced.
Guide her and love her..."

30
00:40:46,889 --> 00:40:51,154
"...keep and protect her from all harm."

31
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,766
"Wilt thou LOVE her?"

32
00:42:01,201 --> 00:42:04,356
"Forgive me!"

33
00:47:24,325 --> 00:47:25,999
"Manicure?"

34
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:02,924
"You'd look grand
with a high polish!"

35
00:50:51,455 --> 00:50:53,882
"Come again!"

36
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:03,841
"Thank you!
And you must come and see us some time."

37
00:52:14,056 --> 00:52:19,247
"Congratulations! She is the
sweetest bride I've seen this year."

38
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,311
"FARMERS!

39
00:56:34,561 --> 00:56:40,793
If you want to sell your home
and move to the city... We Pay Cash!"

40
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:39,196
"Hit the hole...
make the little piggy roll!"

41
01:03:13,629 --> 01:03:16,343
MIDSUMMER
(Peasant Dance)

42
01:09:30,772 --> 01:09:33,965
"We'll sail home by moonlight...
another honeymoon."

43
01:27:56,174 --> 01:28:01,239
"...I couldn't give up hope.
I know the tides... I went around the Point..."

44
01:30:17,649 --> 01:30:23,056
