00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:12,728
Let's go, ladies.

3
00:05:13,572 --> 00:05:14,827
You're useless.

4
00:05:15,287 --> 00:05:16,878
Move it!!

5
00:06:30,934 --> 00:06:32,115
What the fuck?

6
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,421
Stop the ambulance!

7
00:07:21,611 --> 00:07:22,638
My son.

8
00:07:36,101 --> 00:07:38,115
Don't be sad for his death.

9
00:07:43,826 --> 00:07:47,371
The spirit of your father is free
from the bars that confined him.

10
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:54,490
This is the last gift from Papa before he died.

11
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:59,614
You're a man now. You're finally
ready for what needs to be done.

12
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,536
You must bring honor and respect
back to our family.

13
00:08:05,303 --> 00:08:11,196
Your father hid millions of dollars
before he was locked up.

14
00:08:11,294 --> 00:08:13,621
Here are the coordinates where you can find them.

15
00:08:24,018 --> 00:08:25,775
We'll take back what's ours.

16
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,646
With this money we can finally get revenge.

17
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:43,145
The people who destroyed our family
will know how it feels to be hunted.

18
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,283
He dies last.

19
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:13,761
Stay calm.

20
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:56,292
It's ours.

21
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:57,752
That was fast.

22
00:11:57,807 --> 00:11:59,837
We got a new base of operations too.

23
00:12:00,065 --> 00:12:03,363
You've spent so much time on the other
side you sound like a gringo.

24
00:19:09,993 --> 00:19:13,172
I made it clear. Lowrey dies last.

25
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,773
I'm the one up here.

26
00:19:15,408 --> 00:19:18,108
I've learned how to handle things, all right?

27
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:20,032
You've had me training my whole life.

28
00:19:20,102 --> 00:19:22,841
The cop was a threat. The others are nothing!

29
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:24,564
Do you listen to me or not?

30
00:19:24,657 --> 00:19:27,882
I wanted him to see the others die.

31
00:19:28,162 --> 00:19:29,606
Just finish it.

32
00:19:29,687 --> 00:19:31,323
Never disobey me again!

33
00:28:15,916 --> 00:28:17,646
Everything for you, Papa.

34
00:28:27,933 --> 00:28:29,084
He didn't die.

35
00:28:29,594 --> 00:28:31,340
Isn't that what you wanted?

36
00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:35,800
Santa Muerte wouldn't let him die
before he suffered as we have.

37
00:28:35,878 --> 00:28:37,696
Don't kill him until I tell you.

38
00:28:38,118 --> 00:28:39,452
He will suffer.

39
00:28:58,788 --> 00:29:00,930
A little something for your fans...

40
00:53:28,664 --> 00:53:29,725
I had him.

41
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:32,080
I had him right there.

42
00:53:33,216 --> 00:53:34,687
I don't understand, Mama.

43
00:53:36,491 --> 00:53:42,374
A bullet is mercy for this son of a bitch
who took your father from me.

44
00:53:42,718 --> 00:53:44,281
He needs to suffer.

45
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:47,455
Then he dies.

46
00:53:48,364 --> 00:53:49,301
You understand?

47
00:53:49,652 --> 00:53:50,626
Yes.

48
01:00:30,063 --> 01:00:32,751
Mama, they're all gone. It's time?

49
01:00:32,959 --> 01:00:34,587
Yes, kill him.

50
01:00:34,705 --> 01:00:39,198
But before you do it, look in his eyes
and tell him something for me.

51
01:00:39,451 --> 01:00:40,442
What, mama?

52
01:16:12,303 --> 01:16:15,024
Forget about me! Kill them both!

53
01:16:15,469 --> 01:16:16,731
Kill them both!

54
01:21:16,258 --> 01:21:17,338
Move!

55
01:28:43,072 --> 01:28:44,540
The traitor is coming.

56
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:46,569
Get prepared.

57
01:28:47,438 --> 01:28:48,241
We will.

58
01:28:48,786 --> 01:28:50,632
Let's go!

59
01:38:10,951 --> 01:38:12,818
Or should I call you Mike?

60
01:38:31,871 --> 01:38:33,544
Not very thorough.

61
01:38:36,681 --> 01:38:39,383
There was a time when touching
me would have melted you.

62
01:38:50,925 --> 01:38:52,347
This used to be our place.

63
01:38:53,425 --> 01:38:54,727
I wanted you dead...

64
01:38:55,545 --> 01:38:56,844
but you survived.

65
01:38:58,362 --> 01:39:00,985
Perhaps I made you too strong.

66
01:39:02,148 --> 01:39:03,362
Or perhaps...

67
01:39:04,865 --> 01:39:06,911
Santa Muerte is telling us something.

68
01:39:10,238 --> 01:39:12,988
We were fated to meet one more time.

69
01:39:26,497 --> 01:39:27,810
I've taken care of that.

70
01:39:45,007 --> 01:39:46,551
It's just us now.

71
01:39:47,534 --> 01:39:49,924
Why didn't you tell me I had a son?

72
01:39:55,902 --> 01:39:57,351
What would you have done?

73
01:39:58,630 --> 01:39:59,674
Taken care of him.

74
01:40:00,635 --> 01:40:02,081
Like you took care of me?

75
01:50:32,196 --> 01:50:33,829
Is it true what he says?

76
01:50:36,496 --> 01:50:39,258
It doesn't matter. He's nothing to you.

77
01:50:45,014 --> 01:50:46,032
Who is he?

78
01:50:51,836 --> 01:50:53,168
Is he my father?

79
01:58:20,935 --> 01:58:25,935
