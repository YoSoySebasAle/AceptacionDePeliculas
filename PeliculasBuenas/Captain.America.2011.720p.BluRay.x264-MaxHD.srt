1
00:01:14,303 --> 00:01:15,891
Are you the guys from Washington?

2
00:01:16,063 --> 00:01:17,734
You get many other visitors out here?

3
00:01:18,019 --> 00:01:19,397
How long you been on-site?

4
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:20,872
Since this morning.

5
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:23,897
A Russian oil team called
it in about 18 hours ago.

6
00:01:24,076 --> 00:01:26,211
How come nobody spotted it before?

7
00:01:26,555 --> 00:01:28,106
It's really not that surprising.

8
00:01:28,484 --> 00:01:30,610
This landscape's changing all the time.

9
00:01:30,927 --> 00:01:32,692
You got any idea
what this thing is exactly?

10
00:01:32,747 --> 00:01:34,712
I don't know.
It's probably a weather balloon.

11
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:36,153
I don't think so.

12
00:01:36,154 --> 00:01:38,434
You know, we don't have
the equipment for a job like this.

13
00:01:38,736 --> 00:01:41,136
How long before
we can start craning it out?

14
00:01:41,415 --> 00:01:43,176
I don't think you quite understand.

15
00:01:43,694 --> 00:01:46,356
You guys are going to need
one hell of a crane.

16
00:02:32,614 --> 00:02:34,466
<i>Base, we're in.</i>

17
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:41,780
<i>What is this?</i>

18
00:02:57,306 --> 00:02:58,432
<i>Careful.</i>

19
00:03:19,328 --> 00:03:20,537
<i>Lieutenant.</i>

20
00:03:23,945 --> 00:03:24,820
<i>What is it?</i>

21
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,697
<i>My God.</i>

22
00:03:27,002 --> 00:03:29,470
<i>Base, get me a line to the Colonel.</i>

23
00:03:30,205 --> 00:03:31,637
<i>It's 3:00 a.m., sir.</i>

24
00:03:31,638 --> 00:03:33,651
<i>I don't care what time it is.</i>

25
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:36,096
<i>This one's waited long enough.</i>

26
00:03:51,935 --> 00:03:53,239
They have come for it.

27
00:03:53,396 --> 00:03:55,287
They have before.

28
00:03:56,792 --> 00:03:57,940
Not like this.

29
00:03:57,942 --> 00:03:59,265
Let them come.

30
00:03:59,267 --> 00:04:00,808
They will never find it.

31
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,239
Open it.

32
00:04:51,153 --> 00:04:52,429
Quickly before he...

33
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:08,375
It has taken me a long time
to find this place.

34
00:05:11,221 --> 00:05:12,727
You should be commended.

35
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,055
Help him up.

36
00:05:18,447 --> 00:05:22,066
I think that you are a man of great vision.

37
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,637
And in this way, we are much alike.

38
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,997
I am nothing like you.

39
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:27,523
No, of course but...

40
00:05:28,223 --> 00:05:33,024
what others see as superstition,
you and I know to be a science.

41
00:05:33,762 --> 00:05:35,681
What you seek is just a legend.

42
00:05:35,683 --> 00:05:38,121
Then why make such
an effort to conceal it?

43
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:03,065
The Tesseract was the jewel
of Odin's treasure room.

44
00:06:08,697 --> 00:06:10,764
It is not something one buries.

45
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:12,738
But...

46
00:06:13,258 --> 00:06:16,020
I think it is close, yes?

47
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:17,968
I cannot help you.

48
00:06:18,273 --> 00:06:19,095
No.

49
00:06:20,108 --> 00:06:22,795
But maybe you can help your village.

50
00:06:23,078 --> 00:06:25,093
You must have some friends out there.

51
00:06:25,095 --> 00:06:28,039
Some, some little
grandchildren perhaps?

52
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,815
I have no need for them to die.

53
00:06:45,242 --> 00:06:46,607
Yggdrasil.

54
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:50,055
Tree of the world.

55
00:06:52,007 --> 00:06:53,717
Guardian of wisdom.

56
00:06:56,525 --> 00:06:58,354
And fate, also.

57
00:07:29,077 --> 00:07:33,578
And the Fuhrer digs
for trinkets in the desert.

58
00:07:37,152 --> 00:07:40,005
You have never seen this, have you?

59
00:07:40,555 --> 00:07:44,184
It's not for the eyes of ordinary men.

60
00:07:44,426 --> 00:07:45,801
Exactly.

61
00:07:49,342 --> 00:07:51,072
Give the order to open fire.

62
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,090
Yes.

63
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,429
Fool.

64
00:07:54,496 --> 00:07:56,699
You cannot control
the power you hold.

65
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,087
You will burn.

66
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,669
I already have.

67
00:08:13,223 --> 00:08:14,803
O'Connell, Michael.

68
00:08:16,033 --> 00:08:17,844
Kaminsky, Henry.

69
00:08:18,293 --> 00:08:20,284
Boy, a lot of guys
getting killed over there.

70
00:08:20,595 --> 00:08:22,222
Rogers, Steven.

71
00:08:23,438 --> 00:08:25,879
It kind of makes you think twice
about enlisting?

72
00:08:26,635 --> 00:08:27,421
Nope.

73
00:08:30,739 --> 00:08:31,852
Rogers.

74
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,644
What did your father die of?
Mustard gas.

75
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:43,611
He was in the 107th Infantry.

76
00:08:43,613 --> 00:08:44,838
I was hoping I could be...

77
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,915
assigned...
Your mother?

78
00:08:46,121 --> 00:08:47,983
She was a nurse in a TB ward.

79
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:49,127
Got hit.

80
00:08:49,548 --> 00:08:50,533
Couldn't shake it.

81
00:08:54,827 --> 00:08:56,874
Sorry, son.
Look, just give me a chance.

82
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,396
You'd be ineligible
on your asthma alone.

83
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:01,069
Is there anything you can do?

84
00:09:01,345 --> 00:09:02,266
I am doing it.

85
00:09:03,229 --> 00:09:04,385
I am saving your life.

86
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,878
<i>War continues to ravage Europe.</i>

87
00:09:11,913 --> 00:09:13,739
<i>But help is on the way.</i>

88
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:18,725
<i>Every able-bodied young man is
lining up to serve his country.</i>

89
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,419
<i>Even little Timmy is doing his part</i>

90
00:09:24,886 --> 00:09:26,686
<i>collecting scrap metal.</i>

91
00:09:27,228 --> 00:09:28,441
<i>Nice work, Timmy.</i>

92
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,514
Who cares?

93
00:09:30,765 --> 00:09:32,356
Play the movie already.

94
00:09:32,567 --> 00:09:34,372
Hey, you want to show some respect?

95
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:35,658
<i>Meanwhile, overseas,</i>

96
00:09:35,768 --> 00:09:38,229
<i>our brave boys are showing
the Axis powers</i>

97
00:09:38,231 --> 00:09:40,635
<i>that the price of freedom
is never too high.</i>

98
00:09:40,636 --> 00:09:42,879
Let's go.
Get on with it.

99
00:09:43,979 --> 00:09:45,923
Hey, just start the cartoon.

100
00:09:45,926 --> 00:09:47,158
Hey, you want to shut up?

101
00:09:47,925 --> 00:09:49,517
<i>Together with Allied forces,</i>

102
00:09:49,616 --> 00:09:52,182
<i>we will face any threat,
no matter the size.</i>

103
00:10:09,584 --> 00:10:11,560
You just don't know
when to give up, do you?

104
00:10:11,906 --> 00:10:13,492
I can do this all day.

105
00:10:18,113 --> 00:10:19,122
Hey.

106
00:10:19,341 --> 00:10:21,036
Pick on someone your own size.

107
00:10:29,157 --> 00:10:31,730
Sometimes I think
you like getting punched.

108
00:10:32,827 --> 00:10:34,165
I had him on the ropes.

109
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:36,906
How many times is this?

110
00:10:38,206 --> 00:10:39,936
You're from Paramus now?

111
00:10:40,544 --> 00:10:42,779
You know it's illegal to lie
on the enlistment form.

112
00:10:43,065 --> 00:10:44,368
And seriously, Jersey?

113
00:10:46,474 --> 00:10:47,754
You get your orders?

114
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:51,707
The 107th.

115
00:10:51,946 --> 00:10:53,532
Sergeant James Barnes,

116
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,842
shipping out for England
first thing tomorrow.

117
00:10:59,219 --> 00:11:00,610
I should be going.

118
00:11:04,472 --> 00:11:05,597
Come on, man.

119
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:07,312
My last night.

120
00:11:07,702 --> 00:11:09,094
I got to get you cleaned up.

121
00:11:09,296 --> 00:11:10,720
Why? Where are we going?

122
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,107
The future.

123
00:11:17,222 --> 00:11:18,880
I don't see what the problem is.

124
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,759
You're about to be
the last eligible man in New York.

125
00:11:22,165 --> 00:11:24,071
You know there is three and a half
million women here?

126
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,036
Well, I'd settle for just one.

127
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,233
Good thing I took care of that.

128
00:11:28,783 --> 00:11:29,841
Hey, Bucky.

129
00:11:32,187 --> 00:11:33,523
What'd you tell her about me?

130
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,081
Only the good stuff.

131
00:11:37,525 --> 00:11:40,554
<i>Welcome to the Modern Marvels Pavilion</i>

132
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:43,185
<i>and the World of Tomorrow.</i>

133
00:11:43,832 --> 00:11:45,258
<i>A greater world.</i>

134
00:11:45,744 --> 00:11:47,366
<i>A better world.</i>

135
00:11:50,952 --> 00:11:52,060
Oh, my God.

136
00:11:52,343 --> 00:11:53,277
It's starting.

137
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:58,890
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,

138
00:12:08,189 --> 00:12:10,555
I love you, Howard.

<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

140
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:18,013
<i>what if I told you that

141
00:12:18,272 --> 00:12:19,917
<i>your automobile</i>

142
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,135

<i>at all?</i>

144
00:12:24,606 --> 00:12:25,320
<i>Yes.</i>

145
00:12:25,714 --> 00:12:26,908
<i>Thanks, Mandy.</i>

<i>With Stark Gravitic Reversion Technology</i>

147
00:12:29,878 --> 00:12:31,557
<i>you will be able to do just that.</i>

148
00:12:40,097 --> 00:12:41,435
Holy cow.

149
00:12:53,761 --> 00:12:55,820
I did say a few years, didn't I?

150
00:13:04,345 --> 00:13:05,412
Hey Steve,

151
00:13:05,414 --> 00:13:07,316
what do you say we treat these girls...

152
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,070
Come on, soldier.

153
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:25,487
Come on, you're kind of missing
the point of a double date.

154
00:13:25,489 --> 00:13:26,958
We're taking the girls dancing.

155
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:28,611
You go ahead.
I will catch up with you.

156
00:13:32,006 --> 00:13:33,551
You're really going to do this again?

157
00:13:34,198 --> 00:13:35,779
Well, it's a fair.
I am going to try my luck.

158
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:37,404
As who, Steve from Ohio?

159
00:13:37,522 --> 00:13:39,612
They will catch you.
Or worse, they will actually take you.

160
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:43,792
Look, I know you don't think I can do this.
This isn't a back alley, Steve. It's war.

161
00:13:43,793 --> 00:13:45,680
I know it's a war.
Why are you so keen to fight?

162
00:13:45,681 --> 00:13:47,577
There are so many important jobs.
What do you want me to do?

163
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:49,586
Collect scrap metal in my little red wagon?
Yes. Why not?

164
00:13:49,588 --> 00:13:51,296
I am not going to sit in a factory, Bucky.
I don't...

165
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:53,968
Bucky, come on.
There are men laying down their lives.

166
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,855
I got no right to do any less than them.

167
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,556
That's what you don't understand.

168
00:13:58,987 --> 00:14:00,018
This isn't about me.

169
00:14:00,193 --> 00:14:00,812
Right.

170
00:14:01,681 --> 00:14:03,307
Because you got nothing to prove.

171
00:14:06,222 --> 00:14:07,166
Hey, Sarge.

172
00:14:07,842 --> 00:14:09,631
Are we going dancing?

173
00:14:10,318 --> 00:14:11,471
Yes, we are.

174
00:14:17,785 --> 00:14:19,703
Don't do anything stupid until I get back.

175
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:21,507
How can I?

176
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:23,294
You're taking all the stupid with you.

177
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,358
You're a punk.

178
00:14:27,782 --> 00:14:28,585
Jerk.

179
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:30,759
Be careful.

180
00:14:34,721 --> 00:14:36,357
Don't win the war till I get there.

181
00:14:41,387 --> 00:14:42,570
Come on, girls.

182
00:14:42,693 --> 00:14:44,049
They're playing our song.

183
00:15:03,765 --> 00:15:04,669
Wait here.

184
00:15:06,034 --> 00:15:07,105
Is there a problem?

185
00:15:07,244 --> 00:15:08,242
Just wait here.

186
00:15:27,435 --> 00:15:28,543
Thank you.

187
00:15:32,527 --> 00:15:33,197
So...

188
00:15:34,432 --> 00:15:36,108
you want to go overseas.

189
00:15:36,868 --> 00:15:38,292
Kill some Nazis.

190
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:40,077
Excuse me?

191
00:15:40,848 --> 00:15:42,439
Dr. Abraham Erskine.

192
00:15:42,628 --> 00:15:45,571
I represent the Strategic Scientific Reserve.

193
00:15:45,704 --> 00:15:46,587
Steve Rogers.

194
00:15:51,145 --> 00:15:52,317
Where are you from?

195
00:15:53,147 --> 00:15:53,973
Queens.

196
00:15:54,684 --> 00:15:56,953
73rd Street and Utopia Parkway.

197
00:15:57,752 --> 00:15:59,273
Before that, Germany.

198
00:16:00,755 --> 00:16:01,939
This troubles you?

199
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:02,721
No.

200
00:16:03,624 --> 00:16:05,214
Where are you from, Mr. Rogers?

201
00:16:06,171 --> 00:16:07,997
Is it New Haven?

202
00:16:08,896 --> 00:16:10,503
Or Paramus?

203
00:16:11,436 --> 00:16:13,678
Five exams in five different cities.

204
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,834
That might not be the right file.

205
00:16:14,836 --> 00:16:16,803
No, it's not the exams
I am interested in.

206
00:16:16,984 --> 00:16:18,507
It's the five tries.

207
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:21,914
But you didn't answer my question.

208
00:16:22,854 --> 00:16:24,852
Do you want to kill Nazis?

209
00:16:27,337 --> 00:16:28,482
Is this a test?

210
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,434
Yes.

211
00:16:33,855 --> 00:16:35,186
I don't want to kill anyone.

212
00:16:36,257 --> 00:16:37,438
I don't like bullies.

213
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:39,574
I don't care where they're from.

214
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:44,597
Well, there are already
so many big men fighting this war.

215
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,817
Maybe what we need now is a little guy.

216
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,485
I can offer you a chance.

217
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:53,248
Only a chance.

218
00:16:53,758 --> 00:16:55,515
I will take it.
Good.

219
00:16:56,644 --> 00:16:59,539
So where is the little guy from?

220
00:16:59,565 --> 00:17:00,469
Actually?

221
00:17:01,482 --> 00:17:02,779
Brooklyn.

222
00:17:04,952 --> 00:17:07,420
Congratulations, soldier.

223
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:33,706
Are you ready, Dr. Zola?

224
00:17:35,183 --> 00:17:38,812
My machine requires
the most delicate calibration.

225
00:17:40,498 --> 00:17:42,876
Forgive me if I seem overcautious.

226
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,356
Are you certain
that those conductors of yours

227
00:17:45,358 --> 00:17:49,270
can withstand the energy surge
long enough for transference?

228
00:17:49,592 --> 00:17:51,215
With this artifact.

229
00:17:51,632 --> 00:17:53,171
I am certain of nothing.

230
00:17:53,462 --> 00:17:55,446
I fear it may not work at all.

231
00:18:32,686 --> 00:18:34,005
Twenty percent.

232
00:18:36,154 --> 00:18:37,300
Forty.

233
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:41,417
Sixty.

234
00:18:44,569 --> 00:18:46,658
Stabilizing at 70%.

235
00:18:48,489 --> 00:18:52,447
I have not come all this way
for safety, Doctor.

236
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:12,045
What was that?

237
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:15,572
I must congratulate you, Arnim.

238
00:19:16,084 --> 00:19:18,693
Your designs do not disappoint.

239
00:19:19,464 --> 00:19:23,362
Though they may require
some slight reinforcement.

240
00:19:24,392 --> 00:19:26,494
The exchange is stable.

241
00:19:27,194 --> 00:19:28,456
Amazing.

242
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:33,151
The energy we have just collected
could power my designs.

243
00:19:33,481 --> 00:19:34,847
All my designs.

244
00:19:36,571 --> 00:19:39,369
This will change the war.

245
00:19:40,177 --> 00:19:41,715
Dr. Zola,

246
00:19:43,353 --> 00:19:46,050
this will change the world.

247
00:19:48,716 --> 00:19:50,580
Ready, exercise.

248
00:19:50,737 --> 00:19:52,208
Recruits, attention.

249
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:55,099
Gentlemen, I am Agent Carter.

250
00:19:55,387 --> 00:19:58,127
I supervise all operations
for this division.

251
00:19:58,444 --> 00:20:00,275
What's with the accent,
Queen Victoria?

252
00:20:01,574 --> 00:20:03,564
I thought I was signing up
for the U.S. Army.

253
00:20:03,721 --> 00:20:04,957
What's your name, soldier?

254
00:20:05,269 --> 00:20:06,929
Gilmore Hodge, Your Majesty.

255
00:20:06,953 --> 00:20:08,121
Step forward, Hodge.

256
00:20:10,304 --> 00:20:11,669
Put your right foot forward.

257
00:20:13,177 --> 00:20:14,708
We going to wrassle?

258
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:18,596
Because I got a few moves
I know you will like.

259
00:20:21,616 --> 00:20:22,878
Agent Carter.

260
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,271
Colonel Phillips.

261
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,009
I can see that you are breaking
in the candidates.

262
00:20:27,011 --> 00:20:27,886
That's good.

263
00:20:28,406 --> 00:20:29,913
Get your ass up out of that dirt

264
00:20:29,915 --> 00:20:32,500
and stand in that line at attention till
somebody comes tells you what to do.

265
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,374
Yes, sir.

266
00:20:37,298 --> 00:20:38,261
General Patton,

267
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:39,580
has said,

268
00:20:40,248 --> 00:20:43,713
wars are fought with weapons,
but they are won by men.

269
00:20:43,991 --> 00:20:47,730
We are going to win this war
because we have the best men.

270
00:20:51,846 --> 00:20:53,729
And because they are going
to get better.

271
00:20:54,007 --> 00:20:54,882
Much,

272
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,013
better.

273
00:20:56,917 --> 00:20:58,862
The Strategic Scientific Reserve

274
00:20:59,264 --> 00:21:00,616
is an Allied effort,

275
00:21:00,866 --> 00:21:01,783
made up of,

276
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,446
the best minds in the free world.

277
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,331
Our goal,

278
00:21:05,652 --> 00:21:07,484
is to create the best army in history.

279
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:10,051
But every army starts with one man.

280
00:21:10,264 --> 00:21:12,160
Rogers.
Get off of there.

281
00:21:12,162 --> 00:21:14,505
At the end of this week,
we will choose that man.

282
00:21:14,998 --> 00:21:16,082
He will be the first,

283
00:21:16,896 --> 00:21:19,086
in a new breed of super-soldier.

284
00:21:24,745 --> 00:21:25,777
Rogers.

285
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:27,371
Get that rifle out of the mud.

286
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,022
And they...

287
00:21:28,476 --> 00:21:30,476
will personally escort Adolf Hitler

288
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,184
to the gates of hell.

289
00:21:32,232 --> 00:21:34,359
Pick up the pace, ladies.

290
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:36,821
Let's go, let's go.

291
00:21:37,341 --> 00:21:38,652
Double time.

292
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:41,629
Come on.
Faster. Faster.

293
00:21:42,063 --> 00:21:44,361
Move. Move.

294
00:21:44,794 --> 00:21:46,435
Squad, halt.

295
00:21:47,368 --> 00:21:50,108
That flag means
we're only at the halfway point.

296
00:21:50,505 --> 00:21:53,578
First man to bring it to me
gets a ride back with Agent Carter.

297
00:21:53,738 --> 00:21:55,536
Move, move.

298
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,828
Come on.
Get up there.

299
00:21:58,579 --> 00:22:01,274
If that's all you got,
this army's in trouble.

300
00:22:01,275 --> 00:22:02,940
Get up there, Hodge.

301
00:22:03,327 --> 00:22:05,056
Come on.
Get up there.

302
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,874
Nobody's got that flag in 17 years.

303
00:22:11,685 --> 00:22:13,098
Now fall back into line.

304
00:22:13,205 --> 00:22:14,747
Come on, fall in.

305
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,213
Let's go.
Get back into formation.

306
00:22:19,567 --> 00:22:20,518
Rogers.

307
00:22:20,754 --> 00:22:22,266
I said fall in.

308
00:22:38,177 --> 00:22:39,296
Thank you, sir.

309
00:22:48,395 --> 00:22:50,257
Faster ladies. Come on.

310
00:22:50,921 --> 00:22:53,632
My grandmother has more life in her,
God rest her soul.

311
00:22:55,043 --> 00:22:55,772
Move it.

312
00:22:55,863 --> 00:22:57,896
You're not really thinking
about picking Rogers, are you?

313
00:22:58,042 --> 00:23:00,979
I am more than just thinking about it.
He is the clear choice.

314
00:23:01,096 --> 00:23:04,103
When you brought a 90-pound
asthmatic onto my army base,

315
00:23:04,548 --> 00:23:06,142
I let it slide.
I thought what the hell.

316
00:23:06,144 --> 00:23:07,799
Maybe he'd be useful to you,
like a gerbil.

317
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:08,856
I never thought you'd pick him.

318
00:23:08,973 --> 00:23:09,604
Up.

319
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:14,851
You stick a needle in that kid's arm,
it's going to go right through him.

320
00:23:14,867 --> 00:23:16,115
Come on, girls.

321
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:17,901
Look at that.

322
00:23:18,392 --> 00:23:19,537
He's making me cry.

323
00:23:19,757 --> 00:23:22,634
I am looking for qualities
beyond the physical.

324
00:23:22,707 --> 00:23:25,221
Do you know how long it took
to set up this project?

325
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,663
All the groveling I had to do

326
00:23:26,665 --> 00:23:27,769
in front of Senator What's his name's

327
00:23:27,771 --> 00:23:28,852
committees?
Brandt. Yes, I know.

328
00:23:28,854 --> 00:23:30,137
I am well aware of your efforts.

329
00:23:30,139 --> 00:23:31,137
Then throw me a bone.

330
00:23:31,139 --> 00:23:33,234
Hodge passed every test we gave him.

331
00:23:33,581 --> 00:23:35,479
He's big, he's fast.
He obeys orders.

332
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:37,051
He's a soldier.
He is a bully.

333
00:23:37,138 --> 00:23:39,520
You don't win wars with niceness, Doctor.

334
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,487
You win wars,

335
00:23:44,871 --> 00:23:45,810
with guts.

336
00:23:48,055 --> 00:23:48,976
Grenade.

337
00:23:53,761 --> 00:23:54,813
Get away.

338
00:23:55,596 --> 00:23:56,631
Get back.

339
00:24:04,271 --> 00:24:05,795
It was a dummy grenade.

340
00:24:06,907 --> 00:24:09,170
All clear.
Back in formation.

341
00:24:13,214 --> 00:24:14,272
Is this a test?

342
00:24:16,112 --> 00:24:17,246
He's still skinny.

343
00:24:25,796 --> 00:24:27,118
May I?
Yeah.

344
00:24:30,731 --> 00:24:31,564
Can't sleep?

345
00:24:32,825 --> 00:24:34,121
I got the jitters, I guess.

346
00:24:35,069 --> 00:24:35,940
Me, too.

347
00:24:38,172 --> 00:24:39,568
Can I ask you a question?

348
00:24:39,883 --> 00:24:40,951
Just one?

349
00:24:43,487 --> 00:24:44,310
Why me?

350
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:50,496
I suppose that is
the only question that matters.

351
00:24:53,854 --> 00:24:55,215
This is from Augsburg.

352
00:24:55,803 --> 00:24:56,787
My city.

353
00:24:59,757 --> 00:25:03,329
So many people forget that the first
country the Nazis invaded was their own.

354
00:25:03,897 --> 00:25:05,447
You know after the last war,

355
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,960
my people struggled, they,
they felt weak, they felt...

356
00:25:09,624 --> 00:25:10,268
small.

357
00:25:10,507 --> 00:25:12,555
And then Hitler comes along
with the marching

358
00:25:12,557 --> 00:25:14,469
and the big show and the flags
and he...

359
00:25:16,543 --> 00:25:18,031
he hears of me.

360
00:25:19,068 --> 00:25:20,575
My work and he finds me.

361
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:21,938
And he says, You.

362
00:25:23,232 --> 00:25:24,755
He says, You will make us strong.

363
00:25:25,419 --> 00:25:26,183
Well,

364
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,622
I am not interested.

365
00:25:29,617 --> 00:25:31,783
So, he sends the head of Hydra,

366
00:25:32,382 --> 00:25:33,905
his research division.

367
00:25:34,682 --> 00:25:37,268
A brilliant scientist by the name
of Johann Schmidt.

368
00:25:37,464 --> 00:25:39,597
Now, Schmidt is a member
of the inner circle.

369
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,433
And he is ambitious.

370
00:25:41,735 --> 00:25:47,002
He and Hitler share a passion for
occult power and Teutonic myth.

371
00:25:47,775 --> 00:25:50,604
Hitler uses his fantasies
to inspire his followers.

372
00:25:51,023 --> 00:25:52,765
But for Schmidt, it is not fantasy.

373
00:25:53,147 --> 00:25:54,809
For him, it is real.

374
00:25:55,252 --> 00:25:58,976
He has become convinced that there is
a great power hidden in the earth,

375
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:00,235
left here by the gods,

376
00:26:00,364 --> 00:26:03,098
waiting to be seized
by a superior man.

377
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:06,358
So when he hears about
my formula and what it can do,

378
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:08,805
he cannot resist.

379
00:26:11,774 --> 00:26:14,542
Schmidt must become
that superior man.

380
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,178
Did it make him stronger?

381
00:26:21,275 --> 00:26:22,045
Yes.

382
00:26:22,943 --> 00:26:26,007
But there were other effects.

383
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:31,708
The serum was not ready.

384
00:26:32,686 --> 00:26:33,954
But more important,

385
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,788
the man.

386
00:26:36,766 --> 00:26:39,377
The serum amplifies everything
that is inside, so...

387
00:26:40,191 --> 00:26:41,870
good becomes great.

388
00:26:42,292 --> 00:26:44,263
Bad, becomes worse.

389
00:26:49,236 --> 00:26:50,828
This is why you were chosen.

390
00:26:51,972 --> 00:26:53,258
Because a strong man,

391
00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:55,835
who has known power all his life,

392
00:26:55,837 --> 00:26:57,542
may lose respect for that power,

393
00:26:57,543 --> 00:26:58,824
but a weak man,

394
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:01,114
knows the value of strength.

395
00:27:01,541 --> 00:27:03,034
And knows...

396
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:04,765
compassion.

397
00:27:08,222 --> 00:27:09,124
Thanks.

398
00:27:09,703 --> 00:27:10,587
I think.

399
00:27:17,024 --> 00:27:19,526
Whatever happens tomorrow,
you must promise me one thing.

400
00:27:23,003 --> 00:27:24,688
That you will stay who you are.

401
00:27:27,641 --> 00:27:29,160
Not a perfect soldier,

402
00:27:29,922 --> 00:27:30,740
but...

403
00:27:31,478 --> 00:27:33,866
a good man.

404
00:27:38,652 --> 00:27:39,723
To the little guys.

405
00:27:42,927 --> 00:27:44,413
No, no. Wait, wait.
What I am doing?

406
00:27:44,415 --> 00:27:45,971
No, you have procedure tomorrow.

407
00:27:45,973 --> 00:27:46,945
No fluids.

408
00:27:47,694 --> 00:27:49,191
Alright.
We will drink it after.

409
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,598
No, I don't have procedure tomorrow.

410
00:27:51,693 --> 00:27:53,291
Drink it after? I drink it now.

411
00:28:08,749 --> 00:28:11,534
Is there something
in particular you need?

412
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:18,341
I...

413
00:28:18,343 --> 00:28:20,257
I understand you found him.

414
00:28:21,095 --> 00:28:22,722
See for yourself.

415
00:28:34,937 --> 00:28:36,427
You disapprove.

416
00:28:37,077 --> 00:28:40,013
I just don't see
why you need concern yourself.

417
00:28:40,228 --> 00:28:42,157
I can't imagine he will succeed.

418
00:28:44,922 --> 00:28:45,792
Again.

419
00:28:46,587 --> 00:28:50,781
His serum is the Allies' only defense
against this power we now possess.

420
00:28:50,783 --> 00:28:53,623
If we take it away from them,
then our victory is assured.

421
00:28:57,498 --> 00:28:58,982
Shall I give the order?

422
00:29:00,234 --> 00:29:01,797
It has been given.

423
00:29:04,377 --> 00:29:05,370
Good.

424
00:29:08,769 --> 00:29:09,872
Dr. Zola.

425
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,705
What do you think?

426
00:29:21,755 --> 00:29:23,052
A masterpiece.

427
00:29:34,071 --> 00:29:35,732
I know this neighborhood.

428
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,983
I got beat up in that alley.

429
00:29:40,207 --> 00:29:41,450
And that parking lot.

430
00:29:43,544 --> 00:29:44,928
And behind that diner.

431
00:29:46,157 --> 00:29:48,029
Did you have something
against running away?

432
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:53,170
You start running,
they will never let you stop.

433
00:29:53,518 --> 00:29:55,324
You stand up, you push back.

434
00:29:55,933 --> 00:29:57,475
They can't say no forever, right?

435
00:29:57,897 --> 00:29:59,776
I know a little of what that's like,

436
00:29:59,871 --> 00:30:01,515
to have every door shut in your face.

437
00:30:02,729 --> 00:30:04,628
I guess I just don't know
why you'd want to join the Army

438
00:30:04,629 --> 00:30:06,096
if you were a beautiful dame.

439
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,867
Or a beauti... a woman.

440
00:30:07,981 --> 00:30:09,492
An agent, not a dame.

441
00:30:09,636 --> 00:30:10,896
You are beautiful but...

442
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,355
You have no idea
how to talk to a woman, do you?

443
00:30:15,295 --> 00:30:17,358
I think this is the longest conversation
I have had with one.

444
00:30:18,178 --> 00:30:21,289
Women aren't exactly lining up
to dance with a guy they might step on.

445
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:23,465
You must have danced.

446
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:26,436
Well, asking a woman to dance
always seemed so terrifying.

447
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,898
And the past few years, it just...

448
00:30:29,433 --> 00:30:30,971
didn't seem to matter that much.

449
00:30:31,035 --> 00:30:31,995
I figured I'd wait.

450
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:33,614
For what?

451
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:36,604
The right partner.

452
00:30:51,338 --> 00:30:52,401
This way.

453
00:30:56,049 --> 00:30:57,171
What are we doing here?

454
00:30:58,086 --> 00:30:59,103
Follow me.

455
00:31:11,852 --> 00:31:14,513
Wonderful weather this morning, isn't it?

456
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:16,972
Yes, but I always carry an umbrella.

457
00:32:14,461 --> 00:32:15,504
Good morning.

458
00:32:17,197 --> 00:32:18,824
Please, not now.

459
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:24,796
Are you ready?

460
00:32:26,873 --> 00:32:27,585
Good.

461
00:32:28,469 --> 00:32:30,380
Take off your shirt,
your tie and your hat.

462
00:32:36,149 --> 00:32:37,775
Senator Brandt, glad you could make it.

463
00:32:37,776 --> 00:32:39,588
Why exactly am I in Brooklyn?

464
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,527
We needed access
to the city's power grid.

465
00:32:41,529 --> 00:32:43,725
Of course, if you'd given me
the generators I requisitioned...

466
00:32:43,727 --> 00:32:46,020
A lot of people are
asking for funds, Colonel.

467
00:32:46,184 --> 00:32:47,762
This is Clem...

468
00:32:47,764 --> 00:32:49,373
Fred Clemson, State Department.

469
00:32:49,477 --> 00:32:51,016
If this project of yours comes through,

470
00:32:51,018 --> 00:32:53,598
we'd like to see it used
for something other than headlines.

471
00:32:53,743 --> 00:32:54,666
Jesus.

472
00:32:54,934 --> 00:32:56,767
Somebody get that kid a sandwich.

473
00:33:10,462 --> 00:33:11,520
Comfortable?

474
00:33:13,694 --> 00:33:14,934
It's a little big.

475
00:33:17,023 --> 00:33:18,581
You save me any of that schnapps?

476
00:33:19,593 --> 00:33:21,532
Not as much as I should have.

477
00:33:21,978 --> 00:33:22,722
Sorry.

478
00:33:22,995 --> 00:33:23,933
Next time.

479
00:33:25,243 --> 00:33:26,217
Mr. Stark,

480
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,464
how are your levels?

481
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,423
Levels at 100%.
Good.

482
00:33:29,697 --> 00:33:31,673
We may dim half the lights in Brooklyn,

483
00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:33,508
but we are ready,

484
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:35,612
as we will ever be.

485
00:33:36,143 --> 00:33:37,166
Agent Carter?

486
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:39,479
Don't you think you would be
more comfortable in the booth?

487
00:33:39,628 --> 00:33:41,079
Yes, of course. Sorry.
Good.

488
00:33:54,103 --> 00:33:55,639
<i>Do you hear me?
Is this on?</i>

489
00:33:56,675 --> 00:33:57,767
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

490
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:01,901
<i>today we take not another step
towards annihilation,</i>

491
00:34:02,177 --> 00:34:03,371
<i>but the first step,</i>

492
00:34:03,637 --> 00:34:05,662
<i>on the path to peace.</i>

493
00:34:08,008 --> 00:34:11,396
<i>We begin with a series of microinjections,
into the</i>

494
00:34:11,423 --> 00:34:12,974
<i>subject's major muscle groups.</i>

495
00:34:13,806 --> 00:34:15,085
<i>The serum infusion,</i>

496
00:34:15,564 --> 00:34:17,915
<i>will cause immediate cellular change.</i>

497
00:34:18,835 --> 00:34:19,588
<i>And then,</i>

498
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,410
<i>to stimulate growth,</i>

499
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:23,676
<i>the subject will be saturated,</i>

500
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,291
<i>with Vita-Rays.</i>

501
00:34:33,185 --> 00:34:34,354
That wasn't so bad.

502
00:34:35,049 --> 00:34:36,346
That was penicillin.

503
00:34:39,706 --> 00:34:40,916
Serum infusion,

504
00:34:41,323 --> 00:34:42,307
beginning in...

505
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,348
five,

506
00:34:44,798 --> 00:34:45,607
<i>four,</i>

507
00:34:47,047 --> 00:34:48,036
three,

508
00:34:49,249 --> 00:34:50,238
two,

509
00:34:52,271 --> 00:34:53,052
one.

510
00:35:03,763 --> 00:35:05,094
Now, Mr. Stark.

511
00:35:28,623 --> 00:35:29,489
Steven?

512
00:35:30,389 --> 00:35:31,552
Can you hear me?

513
00:35:32,066 --> 00:35:34,331
It's probably too late
to go to the bathroom, right?

514
00:35:36,566 --> 00:35:37,691
We will proceed.

515
00:35:51,025 --> 00:35:52,014
That's 10%.

516
00:35:52,913 --> 00:35:54,076
Twenty percent.

517
00:35:54,314 --> 00:35:55,326
Thirty.

518
00:35:58,232 --> 00:35:59,290
That's 40%.

519
00:36:00,881 --> 00:36:01,870
Vital signs are normal.

520
00:36:02,138 --> 00:36:03,127
That's 50%.

521
00:36:04,088 --> 00:36:04,979
Sixty.

522
00:36:06,393 --> 00:36:07,446
Seventy.

523
00:36:12,265 --> 00:36:13,254
Steven.

524
00:36:14,164 --> 00:36:15,541
Steven.
Shut it down.

525
00:36:15,542 --> 00:36:16,345
Steven!

526
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:18,305
Shut it down.

527
00:36:18,872 --> 00:36:20,319
Kill the reactor, Mr. Stark.

528
00:36:20,326 --> 00:36:21,998
Turn it off. Kill it. Kill the reactor.

529
00:36:22,078 --> 00:36:22,828
No.

530
00:36:23,643 --> 00:36:24,503
Don't.

531
00:36:25,145 --> 00:36:26,492
I can do this.

532
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:34,418
Eighty.

533
00:36:35,114 --> 00:36:35,954
Ninety.

534
00:36:37,324 --> 00:36:39,151
That's 100%.

535
00:37:01,121 --> 00:37:02,071
Mr. Stark?

536
00:37:13,785 --> 00:37:15,685
Steven. Steven.

537
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:19,800
The son of a bitch did it.

538
00:37:26,269 --> 00:37:27,739
I did it.
Yeah, yeah.

539
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:29,265
I think we did it.

540
00:37:29,508 --> 00:37:30,751
You actually did it.

541
00:37:34,703 --> 00:37:35,979
How do you feel?

542
00:37:39,052 --> 00:37:40,181
Taller.

543
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:44,921
You look taller.

544
00:37:45,191 --> 00:37:46,818
How do you like Brooklyn now, Senator?

545
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:50,458
I can think of some folks in Berlin
who are about to get very nervous.

546
00:37:53,667 --> 00:37:55,426
Congratulations, Doctor.

547
00:37:55,981 --> 00:37:57,152
Thank you, sir.

548
00:38:08,871 --> 00:38:09,771
Stop him.

549
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:49,860
Stop him! We have it!

550
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,121
What are you doing?

551
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,909
Buddy, are you alright?

552
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,643
Hey, this guy's been shot.

553
00:39:29,966 --> 00:39:30,955
I had him.

554
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:32,632
Sorry.

555
00:39:53,052 --> 00:39:54,073
I am sorry.

556
00:41:07,082 --> 00:41:08,355
No. No!

557
00:41:08,497 --> 00:41:09,776
Not my son!

558
00:41:10,496 --> 00:41:11,963
Stop it.
Don't hurt him!

559
00:41:14,216 --> 00:41:15,045
Get back.

560
00:41:16,509 --> 00:41:17,698
Let me go.

561
00:41:20,031 --> 00:41:20,550
No!

562
00:41:21,173 --> 00:41:22,393
Let go of my son!

563
00:41:24,878 --> 00:41:25,982
Don't hurt him!

564
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,065
Wait, don't. Don't.

565
00:41:34,456 --> 00:41:35,268
No. Don't.

566
00:41:41,094 --> 00:41:42,062
Go get him.

567
00:41:42,157 --> 00:41:43,156
I can swim.

568
00:42:35,381 --> 00:42:36,514
Who the hell are you?

569
00:42:36,703 --> 00:42:37,764
The first of many.

570
00:42:38,068 --> 00:42:39,352
Cut off one head,

571
00:42:41,727 --> 00:42:43,804
two more shall take its place.

572
00:42:45,992 --> 00:42:47,247
Hail Hydra.

573
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,861
The Fuhrer is not accustomed
to being ignored, Herr Schmidt.

574
00:43:10,182 --> 00:43:12,716
He funds your research because
you promised him weapons.

575
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:14,718
You serve at his pleasure.

576
00:43:14,861 --> 00:43:17,795
He gave you this facility
as a reward for your injuries.

577
00:43:17,797 --> 00:43:20,280
Reward? Call it what it is. Exile.

578
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:23,053
I no longer reflect his image
of Aryan perfection.

579
00:43:23,336 --> 00:43:25,254
You think this is about appearances?

580
00:43:25,691 --> 00:43:27,556
Your Hydra division has failed,

581
00:43:27,558 --> 00:43:30,067
to deliver so much
as a rifle in over a year.

582
00:43:30,068 --> 00:43:32,568
And we had learned
through local intelligence

583
00:43:32,774 --> 00:43:35,731
you had mounted a full-scale
incursion into Norway.

584
00:43:35,882 --> 00:43:37,741
The Fuhrer feels, how does he put it?

585
00:43:37,861 --> 00:43:40,646
The Red Skull has been
indulged long enough.

586
00:43:53,126 --> 00:43:54,388
Gentlemen,

587
00:43:57,196 --> 00:44:00,541
you have come to see
the results of our work.

588
00:44:01,968 --> 00:44:03,265
Let me show you.

589
00:44:05,106 --> 00:44:07,824
Hitler speaks of a 1000-year Reich,

590
00:44:07,826 --> 00:44:09,828
but he cannot feed his armies
for a month.

591
00:44:09,835 --> 00:44:12,788
His troops spill their blood
across every field in Europe,

592
00:44:13,308 --> 00:44:14,951
but still he is no,.

593
00:44:14,953 --> 00:44:17,010
Closer to achieving his goals.

594
00:44:17,727 --> 00:44:21,027
And I suppose you still aim
to win this war through magic?

595
00:44:21,764 --> 00:44:22,777
Science.

596
00:44:22,832 --> 00:44:25,412
But I understand your confusion.

597
00:44:25,856 --> 00:44:28,749
Great power has always
baffled primitive men.

598
00:44:29,043 --> 00:44:33,139
Hydra is assembling an arsenal
to destroy my enemies in one stroke,

599
00:44:33,232 --> 00:44:34,359
wherever they are,

600
00:44:34,572 --> 00:44:36,703
regardless of how many
forces they possess,

601
00:44:36,705 --> 00:44:38,022
all in a matter of hours.

602
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:39,367
Your enemies?

603
00:44:39,368 --> 00:44:42,240
My weapons contain
enough destructive power,

604
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:45,286
to decimate every hostile capital on Earth.

605
00:44:47,346 --> 00:44:48,973
Quite simply, gentlemen,

606
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:52,269
I have harnessed the power of the gods.

607
00:44:54,454 --> 00:44:55,511
Thank you, Schmidt.

608
00:44:55,668 --> 00:44:56,744
For what?

609
00:44:57,179 --> 00:45:00,091
For making it clear
how obviously mad you are.

610
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:01,910
Berlin is on this map.

611
00:45:02,728 --> 00:45:03,790
So it is.

612
00:45:06,523 --> 00:45:08,657
You will be punished
for your insolence.

613
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:11,594
You will be brought before
the Fuhrer himself.

614
00:45:20,813 --> 00:45:22,115
Schmidt...

615
00:45:27,753 --> 00:45:29,603
My apologies, Doctor,

616
00:45:29,687 --> 00:45:34,549
but we both knew Hydra could grow
no further in Hitler's shadow.

617
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:37,394
Hail Hydra.

618
00:45:37,964 --> 00:45:39,523
Hail Hydra.

619
00:45:44,355 --> 00:45:45,527
Hail Hydra.

620
00:45:57,650 --> 00:45:58,897
Think you got enough?

621
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:04,622
Any hope of reproducing the program
is locked in your genetic code.

622
00:46:05,558 --> 00:46:07,724
But without Dr. Erskine,
it would take years.

623
00:46:09,529 --> 00:46:10,989
He deserved more than this.

624
00:46:12,632 --> 00:46:15,664
If it could work only once,
he'd be proud it was you.

625
00:46:19,145 --> 00:46:22,046
Colonel Phillips,
my committee is demanding answers.

626
00:46:22,308 --> 00:46:22,903
Great.

627
00:46:23,134 --> 00:46:27,278
Why don't we start with how a German spy
got a ride to my secret installation in your car?

628
00:46:27,512 --> 00:46:28,328
What have we got here?

629
00:46:28,846 --> 00:46:31,975
Speaking modestly, I am the best
mechanical engineer in this country.

630
00:46:32,185 --> 00:46:34,041
But I don't know what's
inside this thing,

631
00:46:34,043 --> 00:46:35,145
or how it works.

632
00:46:35,414 --> 00:46:37,021
We're not even close to this technology.

633
00:46:37,053 --> 00:46:38,696
Then who is?
Hydra.

634
00:46:39,227 --> 00:46:40,894
I am sure you have been
reading our briefings.

635
00:46:41,237 --> 00:46:43,223
I am on a number
of committees, Colonel.

636
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,519
Hydra is the Nazi deep science division.

637
00:46:45,597 --> 00:46:47,194
It's led by Johann Schmidt.

638
00:46:47,196 --> 00:46:48,970
But he has much bigger ambitions.

639
00:46:49,228 --> 00:46:50,582
Hydra is practically a cult.

640
00:46:50,584 --> 00:46:52,402
They worship Schmidt.
They think he's invincible.

641
00:46:52,572 --> 00:46:53,889
So, what are you going to do about it?

642
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:56,269
I spoke to the President this morning.

643
00:46:56,542 --> 00:46:59,082
As of today, the SSR is being retasked.

644
00:46:59,263 --> 00:46:59,745
Colonel?

645
00:46:59,761 --> 00:47:02,977
We are taking the fight to Hydra.
Pack your bags, agent Carter.

646
00:47:03,197 --> 00:47:04,315
You too Stark.

647
00:47:04,843 --> 00:47:06,349
We're flying to London tonight.

648
00:47:06,621 --> 00:47:07,290
Sir?

649
00:47:07,694 --> 00:47:09,116
If you're going after Schmidt, I want in.

650
00:47:09,214 --> 00:47:11,182
You're an experiment.
You're going to Alamogordo.

651
00:47:11,814 --> 00:47:12,747
The serum worked.

652
00:47:12,874 --> 00:47:15,080
I asked for an army and all I got was you.

653
00:47:15,261 --> 00:47:16,065
You...

654
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:18,104
are not enough.

655
00:47:22,034 --> 00:47:24,005
With all due respect to the Colonel,

656
00:47:24,006 --> 00:47:25,800
I think we may be missing the point.

657
00:47:26,172 --> 00:47:28,121
I have seen you in action, Steve.

658
00:47:28,361 --> 00:47:29,580
More importantly,

659
00:47:29,644 --> 00:47:30,760
the country's seen it.

660
00:47:30,843 --> 00:47:31,721
Paper.

661
00:47:33,036 --> 00:47:36,626
The enlistment lines have been around the
block since your picture hit the newsstands.

662
00:47:37,353 --> 00:47:38,654
You don't take a soldier,

663
00:47:38,656 --> 00:47:40,269
a symbol like that and...

664
00:47:40,786 --> 00:47:42,233
hide him in a lab.

665
00:47:43,075 --> 00:47:43,798
Son,

666
00:47:44,727 --> 00:47:46,569
do you want to serve your country,

667
00:47:47,068 --> 00:47:50,080
on the most important battlefield of the war?

668
00:47:51,264 --> 00:47:51,993
Sir,

669
00:47:52,549 --> 00:47:53,642
that's all I want.

670
00:47:53,866 --> 00:47:55,498
Then, congratulations.

671
00:47:56,125 --> 00:47:57,638
You just got promoted.

672
00:48:00,547 --> 00:48:01,630
I don't know if I can do this.

673
00:48:01,632 --> 00:48:05,555
Nothing to it. You sell a few bonds.
Bonds buy bullets. Bullets kill Nazis.

674
00:48:05,556 --> 00:48:06,439
Ping. Ping. Poom.

675
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:08,086
You're an American hero.

676
00:48:08,684 --> 00:48:10,371
It's just not how I pictured getting there.

677
00:48:11,498 --> 00:48:13,375
The Senator has got
a lot of pull up on the Hill.

678
00:48:13,702 --> 00:48:14,796
You play ball with us,

679
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,653
you will be leading
your own platoon in no time.

680
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:17,950
Take the shield.

681
00:48:19,849 --> 00:48:20,468

the one song, but...

728
00:51:22,172 --> 00:51:23,693
Wait, I will see what I can do.

729
00:51:23,912 --> 00:51:25,338
You do that, sweetheart.

730
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:28,251
Nice boots, Tinker Bell.

731
00:51:29,582 --> 00:51:30,688
Come on guys,

732
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:32,250
we're all on the same team here.

733
00:51:32,252 --> 00:51:33,207
Hey, Captain.

734
00:51:33,784 --> 00:51:34,863
Sign this.

735
00:51:45,364 --> 00:51:46,716
Bring back the girls.

736
00:51:51,716 --> 00:51:52,603
Don't worry, pal.

737
00:51:52,605 --> 00:51:54,193
They will warm up to you.
Don't worry.

738
00:52:02,859 --> 00:52:03,882
Hello, Steve.

739
00:52:05,635 --> 00:52:06,442
Hi.

740
00:52:07,813 --> 00:52:09,599
Hi.
What are you doing here?

741
00:52:10,174 --> 00:52:11,803
Officially, I am not here at all.

742
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:14,136
That was quite a performance.

743
00:52:15,026 --> 00:52:15,752
Yeah.

744
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:18,746
I had to improvise a little bit.

745
00:52:19,215 --> 00:52:21,285
The crowds I am used
to are usually more...

746
00:52:23,401 --> 00:52:24,134
twelve.

747
00:52:24,135 --> 00:52:26,169
I understand you're
America's New Hope.

748
00:52:26,354 --> 00:52:29,174
Bond sales take a 10% bump
in every state I visit.

749
00:52:29,277 --> 00:52:30,748
Is that Senator Brandt I hear?

750
00:52:32,403 --> 00:52:33,908
At least he's got me doing this.

751
00:52:34,452 --> 00:52:36,147
Phillips would have had me stuck in a lab.

752
00:52:36,271 --> 00:52:38,404
And these are your
only two options?

753
00:52:38,951 --> 00:52:41,048
A lab rat or a dancing monkey?

754
00:52:42,149 --> 00:52:43,882
You were meant for more
than this, you know.

755
00:52:50,462 --> 00:52:51,330
What?

756
00:52:52,966 --> 00:52:54,850
You know, for the longest time,
I dreamed about...

757
00:52:56,418 --> 00:52:59,262
coming overseas and
being on the front lines,

758
00:53:00,223 --> 00:53:01,439
serving my country.

759
00:53:02,526 --> 00:53:04,156
I finally got everything I wanted,

760
00:53:07,937 --> 00:53:09,113
and I am wearing tights.

761
00:53:17,489 --> 00:53:19,156
They look like they have been
through hell.

762
00:53:19,792 --> 00:53:21,286
These men more than most.

763
00:53:24,943 --> 00:53:27,462
Schmidt sent out a force to Azzano.

764
00:53:28,459 --> 00:53:30,466
Two hundred men went up
against him,

765
00:53:30,887 --> 00:53:32,642
and less than 50 returned.

766
00:53:33,909 --> 00:53:36,511
Your audience contained
what was left of the 107th.

767
00:53:37,118 --> 00:53:38,983
The rest were killed or captured.

768
00:53:39,277 --> 00:53:40,401
The 107th?

769
00:53:41,136 --> 00:53:42,103
What?

770
00:53:42,408 --> 00:53:43,353
Come on.

771
00:53:44,649 --> 00:53:45,457
Colonel Phillips.

772
00:53:45,507 --> 00:53:47,774
Well, if it isn't the Star Spangled
Man With A Plan.

773
00:53:47,797 --> 00:53:49,083
What's your plan today?

774
00:53:49,099 --> 00:53:50,525
I need the casualty list from Azzano.

775
00:53:50,556 --> 00:53:51,955
You don't get to give me orders, son.

776
00:53:52,025 --> 00:53:54,885
I just need one name,
Sergeant James Barnes from the 107th.

777
00:53:55,636 --> 00:53:58,307
You and I are going to have a
conversation later that you won't enjoy.

778
00:53:58,309 --> 00:54:00,867
Please tell me if he's alive, sir. B-A-R...
I can spell.

779
00:54:07,239 --> 00:54:11,471
I have signed more of these condolence
letters today than I would care to count.

780
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:12,954
But,

781
00:54:13,165 --> 00:54:14,711
the name does sound familiar.

782
00:54:14,986 --> 00:54:16,010
I am sorry.

783
00:54:20,082 --> 00:54:21,175
What about the others?

784
00:54:21,617 --> 00:54:22,969
Are you planning a rescue mission?

785
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:24,381
Yes, it's called winning the war.

786
00:54:25,668 --> 00:54:27,046
But if you know where they are,
why not at least...

787
00:54:27,047 --> 00:54:28,758
They're 30 miles behind the lines

788
00:54:29,133 --> 00:54:32,124
through some of the most
heavily fortified territory in Europe.

789
00:54:32,126 --> 00:54:33,610
We'd lose more men than we'd save.

790
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,556
But I don't expect you to understand
that because you're a chorus girl.

791
00:54:38,544 --> 00:54:40,068
I think I understand just fine.

792
00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:41,997
Well, then understand it somewhere else.

793
00:54:42,307 --> 00:54:45,281
If I read the posters correctly,
you got someplace to be in 30 minutes.

794
00:54:51,383 --> 00:54:52,538
Yes, sir.

795
00:54:53,274 --> 00:54:54,234
I do.

796
00:54:58,302 --> 00:55:01,571
If you have something to say, right now
is the perfect time to keep it to yourself.

797
00:55:06,541 --> 00:55:08,420
What do you plan to do, walk to Austria?

798
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:09,836
If that's what it takes.

799
00:55:09,867 --> 00:55:12,208
You heard the Colonel.
Your friend is most likely dead.

800
00:55:12,357 --> 00:55:13,180
You don't know that.

801
00:55:13,182 --> 00:55:15,393
Even so, he's devising a strategy.
If he detects...

802
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:17,676
By the time he's done that,
it could be too late.

803
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:19,345
Steve.

804
00:55:25,856 --> 00:55:27,785
You told me you thought I was
meant for more than this.

805
00:55:28,839 --> 00:55:29,969
Did you mean that?

806
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:32,547
Every word.

807
00:55:34,426 --> 00:55:35,715
Then you got to let me go.

808
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:40,544
I can do more than that.

809
00:55:41,233 --> 00:55:42,693
On stage, girls.

810
00:55:42,842 --> 00:55:44,227
Five minutes.

811
00:55:45,704 --> 00:55:46,965
Where's my helmet?

812
00:55:47,278 --> 00:55:48,652
Anyone seen Rogers?

813
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:54,640
The Hydra camp is in Krausberg,

814
00:55:54,849 --> 00:55:56,579
tucked between these
two mountain ranges.

815
00:55:56,672 --> 00:55:57,952
It's a factory of some kind.

816
00:55:57,959 --> 00:56:00,068
We should be able to drop
you right on the doorstep.

817
00:56:00,303 --> 00:56:01,731
Just get me as close as you can.

818
00:56:02,042 --> 00:56:03,914
You two are going to be
in a lot of trouble when you land.

819
00:56:03,916 --> 00:56:04,712
And you won't?

820
00:56:05,044 --> 00:56:07,251
Where I am going, if anybody yells
at me, I can just shoot them.

821
00:56:07,584 --> 00:56:08,918
They will undoubtedly shoot back.

822
00:56:09,549 --> 00:56:10,994
Well, let's hope it's good for something.

823
00:56:11,425 --> 00:56:12,202
Agent Carter?

824
00:56:12,489 --> 00:56:13,864
If we're not in too much of a hurry,

825
00:56:13,866 --> 00:56:16,948
I thought we could stop off
in Lucerne for a late-night fondue.

826
00:56:22,596 --> 00:56:25,394
Stark is the best civilian pilot
I have ever seen.

827
00:56:25,604 --> 00:56:28,226
He's mad enough to brave this airspace.
We're lucky to have him.

828
00:56:29,927 --> 00:56:31,690
So, are you two...
Do you...

829
00:56:33,952 --> 00:56:35,006
fondue?

830
00:56:36,541 --> 00:56:38,693
This is your transponder.
Activate it when you're ready

831
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:40,809
and the signal will lead us
straight to you.

832
00:56:42,262 --> 00:56:43,614
Are you sure this thing works?

833
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:46,007
It's been tested more than you, pal.

834
00:56:51,609 --> 00:56:53,895
Get back here.
We're taking you all the way in.

835
00:56:55,808 --> 00:56:58,961
As soon as I am clear, you turn this thing
around and get the hell out of here.

836
00:56:59,225 --> 00:57:01,012
You can't give me orders.

837
00:57:01,313 --> 00:57:02,444
The hell I can't.

838
00:57:02,851 --> 00:57:03,833
I am a Captain.

839
00:57:22,167 --> 00:57:23,506
As you can see,

840
00:57:23,631 --> 00:57:26,486
production of the Valkyrie
is progressing on schedule,

841
00:57:26,718 --> 00:57:28,780
even with components of this size.

842
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:32,439
Increase the output by 60%,

843
00:57:32,441 --> 00:57:35,866
and see to it our other facilities
do the same.

844
00:57:36,841 --> 00:57:37,523
But...

845
00:57:37,525 --> 00:57:38,912
these prisoners I...

846
00:57:39,062 --> 00:57:40,965
I am not sure they have the strength.

847
00:57:41,344 --> 00:57:43,997
Then use up what strength
they have left, Doctor.

848
00:57:44,939 --> 00:57:47,438
There are always more workers.

849
00:57:49,738 --> 00:57:50,864
Not now.

850
00:58:06,152 --> 00:58:07,757
You know, Fritz,

851
00:58:09,053 --> 00:58:11,351
one of these days,
I am going to have a stick of my own.

852
00:58:44,526 --> 00:58:45,457
Fellas.

853
01:00:47,408 --> 01:00:48,705
Who are you supposed to be?

854
01:00:48,996 --> 01:00:49,838
I'm...

855
01:00:50,816 --> 01:00:51,928
Captain America.

856
01:00:53,073 --> 01:00:54,758
I beg your pardon?

857
01:00:58,116 --> 01:00:59,699
What, are we taking everybody?

858
01:01:00,494 --> 01:01:02,052
I am from Fresno, Ace.

859
01:01:02,194 --> 01:01:03,104
Is there anybody else?

860
01:01:03,293 --> 01:01:05,121
I am looking for
a Sergeant James Barnes.

861
01:01:05,123 --> 01:01:07,995
There's an isolation ward in the factory,
but no one's ever come back from it.

862
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:08,991
Alright.

863
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:11,727
The tree line is northwest,
80 yards past the gate.

864
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,724
Get out fast and give them hell.

865
01:01:13,956 --> 01:01:15,864
I will meet you guys in the clearing
with anybody else I find.

866
01:01:15,911 --> 01:01:16,494
Wait.

867
01:01:16,998 --> 01:01:18,158
You know what you're doing?

868
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:18,769
Yeah.

869
01:01:18,771 --> 01:01:21,104
I have knocked out
Adolf Hitler over 200 times.

870
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,334
You know how to use that thing?

871
01:01:52,627 --> 01:01:53,287
Ok.

872
01:01:55,555 --> 01:01:56,526
What is happening?

873
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:05,652
Hey.

874
01:02:06,145 --> 01:02:07,618
Not exactly a Buick.

875
01:02:08,529 --> 01:02:10,463
That one. Zundung.
Zundung?

876
01:02:11,289 --> 01:02:12,530
Get this thing going, Dugan.

877
01:02:12,532 --> 01:02:13,816
I didn't know you spoke German.

878
01:02:13,878 --> 01:02:15,234
Three semesters at Howard,

879
01:02:15,236 --> 01:02:16,907
switched to French, girls much cuter.

880
01:02:17,176 --> 01:02:18,249
Didn't ask for the resume.

881
01:02:30,842 --> 01:02:31,855
On your left!

882
01:02:31,974 --> 01:02:32,542
Up top.

883
01:02:49,953 --> 01:02:52,054
No, no.
What are you doing?

884
01:02:53,231 --> 01:02:55,715
Our forces are outmatched.

885
01:03:21,025 --> 01:03:21,994
Keep moving.

886
01:03:22,273 --> 01:03:23,383
Grab those grenades.

887
01:04:03,168 --> 01:04:04,210
Sergeant.

888
01:04:04,743 --> 01:04:06,792
Three-two-five-five-seven.

889
01:04:07,272 --> 01:04:07,975
Bucky?

890
01:04:09,475 --> 01:04:10,442
Oh, my God.

891
01:04:15,644 --> 01:04:17,111
Is that...
It's me.

892
01:04:17,372 --> 01:04:19,410
It's Steve.
Steve?

893
01:04:19,443 --> 01:04:20,950
Come on.
Steve.

894
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:26,213
I thought you were dead.

895
01:04:26,853 --> 01:04:28,218
I thought you were smaller.

896
01:04:36,356 --> 01:04:37,189
Come on.

897
01:04:39,893 --> 01:04:41,121
What happened to you?

898
01:04:41,123 --> 01:04:42,370
I joined the Army.

899
01:04:48,747 --> 01:04:49,839
Did it hurt?

900
01:04:49,841 --> 01:04:50,747
A little.

901
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:52,414
Is this permanent?

902
01:04:52,954 --> 01:04:53,769
So far.

903
01:05:24,019 --> 01:05:25,646
Captain America.

904
01:05:25,703 --> 01:05:27,330
How exciting.

905
01:05:28,169 --> 01:05:30,726
I am a great fan of your films.

906
01:05:33,055 --> 01:05:36,502
So, Dr. Erskine managed it after all.

907
01:05:37,176 --> 01:05:39,763
Not exactly an improvement but,

908
01:05:39,765 --> 01:05:40,355
still...

909
01:05:41,341 --> 01:05:42,317
impressive.

910
01:05:45,225 --> 01:05:46,495
You have got no idea.

911
01:05:50,084 --> 01:05:51,044
Haven't I?

912
01:06:06,428 --> 01:06:09,641
No matter what lies Erskine told you,

913
01:06:09,922 --> 01:06:12,528
you see, I was his greatest success.

914
01:06:26,467 --> 01:06:28,145
You don't have one of those, do you?

915
01:06:28,558 --> 01:06:30,626
You are deluded, Captain.

916
01:06:31,269 --> 01:06:34,056
You pretend to be a simple soldier,

917
01:06:34,058 --> 01:06:35,496
but in reality,

918
01:06:35,498 --> 01:06:39,918
you are just afraid to admit that
we have left humanity behind.

919
01:06:42,196 --> 01:06:45,246
Unlike you, I embrace it proudly.

920
01:06:46,310 --> 01:06:47,368
Without fear.

921
01:06:47,528 --> 01:06:48,825
Then how come you're running?

922
01:07:00,598 --> 01:07:02,455
Come on, let's go. Up.

923
01:07:05,985 --> 01:07:08,161
Sir? Are we going to the roof?

924
01:07:11,593 --> 01:07:12,890
What about me?

925
01:07:13,469 --> 01:07:14,761
Where will I sit?

926
01:07:15,891 --> 01:07:17,361
Not a scratch, Doctor.

927
01:07:17,399 --> 01:07:18,487
Not a scratch.

928
01:07:51,849 --> 01:07:53,610
Let's go.
One at a time.

929
01:08:23,024 --> 01:08:25,066
Got to be a rope or something.
Just go!

930
01:08:25,221 --> 01:08:26,023
Get out of here!

931
01:08:26,025 --> 01:08:27,491
No. Not without you!

932
01:08:28,085 --> 01:08:29,067
Hell.

933
01:08:51,017 --> 01:08:52,693
Senator Brandt I...

934
01:08:53,147 --> 01:08:57,954
regret to report that Captain Steven G. Rogers
went missing behind enemy lines on the...

935
01:08:58,296 --> 01:08:59,014
third.

936
01:08:59,302 --> 01:09:01,650
Aerial reconnaissance
has proven unfruitful.

937
01:09:01,652 --> 01:09:02,886
As a result,

938
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:05,416
I must declare Captain Rogers

939
01:09:06,277 --> 01:09:08,268
killed in action. Period.

940
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:14,219
The last surveillance flight is back.

941
01:09:16,737 --> 01:09:18,156
No sign of activity.

942
01:09:19,526 --> 01:09:21,039
Go get a cup of coffee, Corporal.

943
01:09:21,041 --> 01:09:21,868
Yes, sir.

944
01:09:25,004 --> 01:09:26,766
I can't touch Stark.
He's rich...

945
01:09:27,253 --> 01:09:29,347
and he's the Army's number one
weapons contractor.

946
01:09:29,349 --> 01:09:30,399
You are neither one.

947
01:09:30,407 --> 01:09:32,564
With respect, sir,
I don't regret my actions.

948
01:09:32,995 --> 01:09:34,828
And I don't think
Captain Rogers did, either.

949
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:37,416
What makes you think
I give a damn about your opinions?

950
01:09:37,816 --> 01:09:39,514
I took a chance with you, Agent Carter.

951
01:09:39,516 --> 01:09:42,713
And now America's golden boy
and a lot of other good men are dead,

952
01:09:43,529 --> 01:09:44,589
because you had a crush.

953
01:09:44,591 --> 01:09:45,364
It wasn't that.

954
01:09:46,021 --> 01:09:47,018
I had faith.

955
01:09:47,261 --> 01:09:50,937
Well, I hope that's a big comfort to you
when they shut this division down.

956
01:09:54,138 --> 01:09:55,799
What the hell's going on out there?

957
01:10:38,382 --> 01:10:39,771
Look who it is.

958
01:11:07,672 --> 01:11:09,437
Some of these men
need medical attention.

959
01:11:09,438 --> 01:11:11,659
Medic, we got wounded.
Right over here.

960
01:11:12,096 --> 01:11:14,198
I'd like to surrender myself
for disciplinary action.

961
01:11:15,881 --> 01:11:17,294
That won't be necessary.

962
01:11:21,191 --> 01:11:22,419
Yes, sir.

963
01:11:24,207 --> 01:11:25,170
Faith?

964
01:11:32,022 --> 01:11:33,176
You're late.

965
01:11:37,661 --> 01:11:38,912
Couldn't call my ride.

966
01:11:41,178 --> 01:11:42,063
Hey!

967
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:44,946
Let's hear it for Captain America.

968
01:12:01,565 --> 01:12:04,823
I am honored to present
this medal for valor,

969
01:12:04,825 --> 01:12:06,812
to my personal friend,

970
01:12:07,594 --> 01:12:08,929
Captain America.

971
01:12:11,531 --> 01:12:12,738
Captain America.

972
01:12:14,587 --> 01:12:16,281
Captain, that's your cue.

973
01:12:20,469 --> 01:12:22,273
I thought he'd be taller.

974
01:12:34,756 --> 01:12:37,408
The fifth one was here in Poland,
right near the Baltic.

975
01:12:37,475 --> 01:12:39,712
And the sixth one was...

976
01:12:40,352 --> 01:12:42,591
about... here,

977
01:12:42,593 --> 01:12:45,249
30, 40 miles west of the Maginot Line.

978
01:12:46,911 --> 01:12:48,170
I just got a quick look.

979
01:12:49,635 --> 01:12:51,154
Well, nobody's perfect.

980
01:12:54,752 --> 01:12:56,776
These are the weapon factories
we know about.

981
01:12:57,858 --> 01:13:01,961
Sergeant Barnes said that Hydra shipped all
the parts to another facility that isn't on this map.

982
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:04,148
Agent Carter, coordinate with MI6.

983
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:06,768
I want every Allied eyeball
looking for that main Hydra base.

984
01:13:06,925 --> 01:13:07,687
What about us?

985
01:13:07,906 --> 01:13:10,561
We are going to set a fire
under Johann Schmidt's ass.

986
01:13:10,813 --> 01:13:11,737
What do you say, Rogers?

987
01:13:12,463 --> 01:13:14,533
It's your map. You think
you can wipe Hydra off it?

988
01:13:14,947 --> 01:13:15,714
Yes, sir.

989
01:13:16,027 --> 01:13:17,084
I will need a team.

990
01:13:17,086 --> 01:13:18,962
We're already putting together
the best men.

991
01:13:19,398 --> 01:13:20,822
With all due respect sir,

992
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:22,298
so am I.

993
01:13:23,752 --> 01:13:24,829
So, let's get this straight.

994
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,201
We barely got out of there alive,
and you want us to go back?

995
01:13:28,923 --> 01:13:29,779
Pretty much.

996
01:13:30,147 --> 01:13:31,090
Sounds rather,

997
01:13:31,513 --> 01:13:32,668
fun actually.

998
01:13:34,298 --> 01:13:35,026
I am in.

999
01:13:35,135 --> 01:13:38,050
I will fight until the last of these
bastards are dead,

1000
01:13:38,214 --> 01:13:40,320
chained or crying like a little baby.

1001
01:13:40,429 --> 01:13:41,701
I hope the three.

1002
01:13:41,933 --> 01:13:43,181
Me too!

1003
01:13:47,827 --> 01:13:48,676
We're in.

1004
01:13:49,979 --> 01:13:51,433
Hell, I will always fight.

1005
01:13:51,458 --> 01:13:53,316
But you got to do one thing for me.

1006
01:13:53,705 --> 01:13:54,660
What's that?

1007
01:13:56,586 --> 01:13:57,610
Open a tab.

1008
01:14:01,218 --> 01:14:02,531
Well, that was easy.

1009
01:14:03,162 --> 01:14:04,081
Another round.

1010
01:14:04,083 --> 01:14:05,597
Where are they putting all this stuff?

1011
01:14:09,739 --> 01:14:10,327
See?

1012
01:14:10,907 --> 01:14:11,995
I told you.

1013
01:14:12,443 --> 01:14:13,903
They're all idiots.

1014
01:14:15,125 --> 01:14:16,044
How about you?

1015
01:14:17,377 --> 01:14:20,413
You ready to follow Captain America
into the jaws of death?

1016
01:14:20,577 --> 01:14:21,461
Hell, no.

1017
01:14:21,986 --> 01:14:26,032
That little guy from Brooklyn who was
too dumb not to run away from a fight.

1018
01:14:27,244 --> 01:14:28,681
I am following him.

1019
01:14:32,829 --> 01:14:34,523
But you're keeping the outfit, right?

1020
01:14:36,863 --> 01:14:37,857
You know what?

1021
01:14:39,118 --> 01:14:40,241
It's kind of growing on me.

1022
01:14:51,669 --> 01:14:53,391
Captain.
Agent Carter.

1023
01:14:55,806 --> 01:14:56,772
Ma'am.

1024
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,772
Howard has some equipment
for you to try,

1025
01:14:58,774 --> 01:14:59,759
tomorrow morning?

1026
01:15:00,124 --> 01:15:01,152
Sounds good.

1027
01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:08,535
I see your top squad is prepping for duty.

1028
01:15:09,456 --> 01:15:10,532
You don't like music?

1029
01:15:10,898 --> 01:15:12,070
I do, actually.

1030
01:15:13,753 --> 01:15:16,815
I might, even when
this is all over, go dancing.

1031
01:15:16,912 --> 01:15:18,381
Then what are we waiting for?

1032
01:15:19,798 --> 01:15:21,050
The right partner.

1033
01:15:22,577 --> 01:15:23,894
0800, Captain.

1034
01:15:24,635 --> 01:15:25,703
Yes, ma'am.

1035
01:15:26,025 --> 01:15:26,963
I will be there.

1036
01:15:27,596 --> 01:15:28,645
I am invisible.

1037
01:15:29,444 --> 01:15:31,165
I am turning into you.

1038
01:15:31,167 --> 01:15:32,434
It's like a horrible dream.

1039
01:15:33,312 --> 01:15:34,425
Don't take it so hard.

1040
01:15:34,833 --> 01:15:36,051
Maybe she's got a friend.

1041
01:15:38,242 --> 01:15:40,443
Emission signature is unusual.

1042
01:15:41,227 --> 01:15:42,882
Alpha and beta ray neutral.

1043
01:15:44,521 --> 01:15:46,545
Though I doubt Rogers
picked up on that.

1044
01:15:48,717 --> 01:15:50,204
Seems harmless enough.

1045
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:53,345
Hard to see what all the fuss is about.

1046
01:16:02,893 --> 01:16:04,111
Write that down.

1047
01:16:06,132 --> 01:16:07,015
Excuse me.

1048
01:16:07,017 --> 01:16:08,538
I am looking for Mr. Stark.

1049
01:16:08,742 --> 01:16:10,224
He's in with Colonel Phillips.

1050
01:16:16,221 --> 01:16:18,240
Of course, you're welcome to wait.

1051
01:16:23,296 --> 01:16:24,279
I...

1052
01:16:25,772 --> 01:16:27,129
read about what you did.

1053
01:16:28,142 --> 01:16:29,058
Tthe... Yeah.

1054
01:16:30,227 --> 01:16:31,391
Well, that's you know.

1055
01:16:33,337 --> 01:16:34,736
Just doing what needed to be done.

1056
01:16:34,772 --> 01:16:37,805
Sounded like more than that.
You saved nearly 400 men.

1057
01:16:43,948 --> 01:16:45,916
Really, it's not a big deal.

1058
01:16:47,043 --> 01:16:48,894
Tell that to their wives.

1059
01:16:52,463 --> 01:16:54,055
I don't think they were all married.

1060
01:16:54,123 --> 01:16:55,164
You're a hero.

1061
01:16:55,952 --> 01:16:57,091
Well, that, no.

1062
01:16:57,093 --> 01:16:58,634
That depends on the definition, really.

1063
01:16:58,636 --> 01:16:59,830
The women of America,

1064
01:17:00,176 --> 01:17:01,532
they owe you their thanks.

1065
01:17:03,165 --> 01:17:05,802
And seeing as they're not here...

1066
01:17:14,510 --> 01:17:15,498
Captain.

1067
01:17:15,921 --> 01:17:18,372
We're ready for you,
if you're not otherwise occupied.

1068
01:17:19,803 --> 01:17:20,933
Agent Carter, wait.

1069
01:17:21,260 --> 01:17:23,386
Looks like finding a partner
wasn't that hard after all.

1070
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,170
Peggy, that's not
what you thought it was.

1071
01:17:25,216 --> 01:17:27,683
I don't think anything, Captain,
not one thing.

1072
01:17:28,359 --> 01:17:30,197
You always wanted to be a soldier,
and now you are,

1073
01:17:30,338 --> 01:17:31,622
just like all the rest.

1074
01:17:32,248 --> 01:17:33,305
Well, what about you and Stark?

1075
01:17:33,307 --> 01:17:34,817
How do I know you two haven't been...

1076
01:17:35,194 --> 01:17:36,181
fondue-ing?

1077
01:17:40,818 --> 01:17:43,182
You still don't know
a bloody thing about women.

1078
01:17:44,751 --> 01:17:46,596
Fondue is just cheese and bread,
my friend.

1079
01:17:46,706 --> 01:17:47,374
Really?

1080
01:17:47,696 --> 01:17:49,210
I didn't think...
Nor should you, pal.

1081
01:17:49,554 --> 01:17:51,715
The moment you think you know
what's going on in a woman's head

1082
01:17:51,817 --> 01:17:53,948
is the moment your goose
is well and truly cooked.

1083
01:17:54,269 --> 01:17:56,645
Me, I concentrate on work,
which at the moment

1084
01:17:56,987 --> 01:17:59,587
is about making sure you and your men
do not get killed.

1085
01:18:00,093 --> 01:18:01,385
Carbon polymer.

1086
01:18:02,395 --> 01:18:04,591
Should withstand your average
German bayonet.

1087
01:18:04,978 --> 01:18:07,975
Although Hydra's not going
to attack you with a pocket knife.

1088
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:09,756
I hear you're...

1089
01:18:10,212 --> 01:18:11,339
kind of attached.

1090
01:18:11,717 --> 01:18:13,046
It's handier than you might think.

1091
01:18:13,048 --> 01:18:15,168
I took the liberty of coming up
with some options.

1092
01:18:16,237 --> 01:18:17,261
This one's fun.

1093
01:18:17,792 --> 01:18:19,810
She's been fitted with
electrical relays

1094
01:18:19,922 --> 01:18:21,119
that allow you to...
What about this one?

1095
01:18:21,121 --> 01:18:22,091
No, no, that's just a prototype.

1096
01:18:22,093 --> 01:18:22,996
What's it made of?

1097
01:18:23,630 --> 01:18:24,474
Vibranium.

1098
01:18:25,451 --> 01:18:27,410
It's stronger than steel
and a third the weight.

1099
01:18:28,711 --> 01:18:31,183
It's completely vibration absorbent.

1100
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:34,747
How come it's not standard issue?

1101
01:18:34,923 --> 01:18:36,329
That's the rarest metal on Earth.

1102
01:18:36,409 --> 01:18:38,134
What you're holding there,
that's all we have got.

1103
01:18:38,322 --> 01:18:39,732
You quite finished, Mr. Stark?

1104
01:18:40,572 --> 01:18:42,555
I am sure the Captain
has some unfinished business.

1105
01:18:42,717 --> 01:18:43,573
What do you think?

1106
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:55,833
Yes, I think it works.

1107
01:19:05,355 --> 01:19:07,025
I had some ideas about the uniform.

1108
01:19:07,913 --> 01:19:09,247
Whatever you want, pal.

1109
01:21:14,302 --> 01:21:15,995
You are failing.

1110
01:21:17,432 --> 01:21:20,744
We are close to an offensive
that will shake the planet,

1111
01:21:21,033 --> 01:21:25,479
yet we are continually delayed because
you cannot outwit a simpleton with a shield.

1112
01:21:25,549 --> 01:21:27,600
This is hardly my area of expertise.

1113
01:21:27,602 --> 01:21:30,224
I. I merely developed the weapons.

1114
01:21:30,226 --> 01:21:31,755
I cannot fire them.

1115
01:21:32,634 --> 01:21:36,254
Finish your mission, Doctor,
before the American finishes his.

1116
01:21:36,739 --> 01:21:37,459
Sir.

1117
01:21:39,838 --> 01:21:40,996
I am sorry, Herr Schmidt.

1118
01:21:42,784 --> 01:21:44,351
We fought to the last man.

1119
01:21:47,484 --> 01:21:49,452
Evidently not.

1120
01:22:01,965 --> 01:22:04,658
Remember when I made you ride
the Cyclone at Coney Island?

1121
01:22:05,299 --> 01:22:06,692
Yeah, and I threw up?

1122
01:22:08,231 --> 01:22:09,404
This isn't payback, is it?

1123
01:22:09,650 --> 01:22:11,072
Now why would I do that?

1124
01:22:11,454 --> 01:22:13,856
We were right. Dr. Zola's on the train.

1125
01:22:14,368 --> 01:22:17,111
Hydra dispatcher gave him permission
to open up the throttle.

1126
01:22:18,071 --> 01:22:20,019
Wherever he's going,
they must need him bad.

1127
01:22:27,171 --> 01:22:29,422
Let's get going because
they're moving like the devil.

1128
01:22:30,076 --> 01:22:31,886
We only got about
a 10 second window.

1129
01:22:31,888 --> 01:22:33,027
You miss that window,

1130
01:22:33,413 --> 01:22:34,828
we're bugs on a windshield.

1131
01:22:35,056 --> 01:22:36,022
Mind the gap.

1132
01:22:36,024 --> 01:22:37,678
Better get moving, bugs.

1133
01:22:39,489 --> 01:22:40,254
Now!

1134
01:22:45,890 --> 01:22:46,656
Go!

1135
01:23:45,804 --> 01:23:46,434
Stop him.

1136
01:23:47,186 --> 01:23:48,308
Fire again.

1137
01:24:40,604 --> 01:24:42,883
I had him on the ropes.
I know you did.

1138
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:44,584
Get down.

1139
01:24:46,830 --> 01:24:48,116
Fire again.

1140
01:24:48,932 --> 01:24:50,350
<i>Kill him. Now.</i>

1141
01:24:58,123 --> 01:24:59,058
Bucky!

1142
01:25:02,813 --> 01:25:04,090
Hang on.

1143
01:25:06,216 --> 01:25:07,314
Grab my hand.

1144
01:25:08,065 --> 01:25:08,705
Now!

1145
01:26:12,549 --> 01:26:13,846
Sit down.

1146
01:26:20,323 --> 01:26:21,621
What is this?

1147
01:26:21,693 --> 01:26:22,692
Steak.

1148
01:26:23,622 --> 01:26:24,941
What is in it?

1149
01:26:25,985 --> 01:26:26,721
Cow.

1150
01:26:30,568 --> 01:26:33,619
Doctor, do you realize
how difficult it is,

1151
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:36,135
to get ahold of a prime cut
like that out here?

1152
01:26:37,847 --> 01:26:39,246
I don't eat meat.

1153
01:26:40,151 --> 01:26:41,128
Why not?

1154
01:26:41,386 --> 01:26:42,912
It disagrees with me.

1155
01:26:43,063 --> 01:26:46,297
How about cyanide?
Does that give you the rumbly tummy, too?

1156
01:26:49,091 --> 01:26:52,438
Every Hydra agent that
we have tried to take alive

1157
01:26:52,510 --> 01:26:55,294
has crunched a little pill
before we can stop him.

1158
01:26:55,968 --> 01:26:56,964
But not you.

1159
01:26:58,016 --> 01:26:58,740
So,

1160
01:26:59,561 --> 01:27:01,074
here is my brilliant theory.

1161
01:27:03,260 --> 01:27:04,347
You want to live.

1162
01:27:05,942 --> 01:27:08,101
You're trying to intimidate me, Colonel.

1163
01:27:08,706 --> 01:27:09,923
I bought you dinner.

1164
01:27:15,509 --> 01:27:18,571
Given the valuable information
he has provided,

1165
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:22,610
and in exchange
for his full cooperation,

1166
01:27:23,107 --> 01:27:26,297
Dr. Zola is being remanded
to Switzerland?

1167
01:27:26,305 --> 01:27:28,370
I sent that message
to Washington this morning,

1168
01:27:29,052 --> 01:27:30,431
of course it was encoded.

1169
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:32,778
You guys haven't broken
those codes, have you?

1170
01:27:33,325 --> 01:27:34,494
That would be awkward.

1171
01:27:34,496 --> 01:27:36,625
Schmidt will know this is a lie.

1172
01:27:36,703 --> 01:27:38,010
He's going to kill you anyway, Doc.

1173
01:27:38,635 --> 01:27:40,013
You're a liability.

1174
01:27:40,637 --> 01:27:42,438
You know more about
Schmidt than anyone.

1175
01:27:43,146 --> 01:27:43,960
And,

1176
01:27:44,678 --> 01:27:48,176
the last guy you cost us
was Captain Rogers' closest friend,

1177
01:27:48,178 --> 01:27:50,722
so I wouldn't count on
the very best of protection.

1178
01:27:51,943 --> 01:27:54,239
It's you or Schmidt.

1179
01:27:55,289 --> 01:27:57,070
It's just the hand you have been dealt.

1180
01:27:59,656 --> 01:28:03,136
Schmidt believes he walks
in the footsteps of the gods.

1181
01:28:04,671 --> 01:28:07,530
Only the world itself will satisfy him.

1182
01:28:07,827 --> 01:28:09,428
You do realize that's nuts, don't you?

1183
01:28:09,903 --> 01:28:10,594
What?

1184
01:28:11,987 --> 01:28:14,208
The sanity of the plan
is of no consequence.

1185
01:28:14,301 --> 01:28:16,420
And why is that?
Because he can do it.

1186
01:28:16,996 --> 01:28:18,293
What's his target?

1187
01:28:19,809 --> 01:28:21,833
His target...

1188
01:28:23,346 --> 01:28:25,135
is everywhere.

1189
01:28:45,305 --> 01:28:46,608
Tomorrow,

1190
01:28:47,949 --> 01:28:50,834
Hydra will stand master of the world,

1191
01:28:52,010 --> 01:28:55,016
borne to victory
on the wings of the Valkyrie.

1192
01:28:55,547 --> 01:28:59,398
Our enemies' weapons
will be powerless against us.

1193
01:29:00,039 --> 01:29:04,870
If they shoot down one plane,
hundreds more will rain fire upon them.

1194
01:29:09,468 --> 01:29:11,508
If they cut off one head,

1195
01:29:12,409 --> 01:29:14,809
two more shall take its place.

1196
01:29:15,701 --> 01:29:16,790
Hail Hydra.

1197
01:29:17,210 --> 01:29:18,301
Hail Hydra.
Hail Hydra.

1198
01:29:18,824 --> 01:29:21,523
Hail Hydra. Hail Hydra.

1199
01:29:21,984 --> 01:29:24,531
Hail Hydra. Hail Hydra.

1200
01:29:24,570 --> 01:29:27,589
Hail Hydra. Hail Hydra.

1201
01:29:33,596 --> 01:29:36,276
<i>Blackout is still in effect
throughout the London area.</i>

1202
01:29:36,655 --> 01:29:38,493
<i>Please wait for the all-clear.</i>

1203
01:29:39,093 --> 01:29:40,214
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

1204
01:29:40,943 --> 01:29:44,144
<i>All citizens shall remain
indoors until further notice.</i>

1205
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:47,740
<i>Blackout is still in effect
throughout the London area.</i>

1206
01:29:55,694 --> 01:29:57,483
Dr. Erskine said that

1207
01:29:58,215 --> 01:30:00,746
the serum wouldn't
just affect my muscles,

1208
01:30:00,748 --> 01:30:02,503
it would affect my cells.

1209
01:30:03,592 --> 01:30:07,391
Create a protective system
of regeneration and healing.

1210
01:30:07,791 --> 01:30:08,819
Which means...

1211
01:30:11,464 --> 01:30:12,912
I can't get drunk.

1212
01:30:14,901 --> 01:30:16,051
Did you know that?

1213
01:30:16,655 --> 01:30:20,791
Your metabolism burns four times
faster than the average person.

1214
01:30:22,946 --> 01:30:24,851
He thought it could be
one of the side effects.

1215
01:30:30,501 --> 01:30:31,968
It wasn't your fault.

1216
01:30:33,744 --> 01:30:34,796
Did you read the report?

1217
01:30:34,798 --> 01:30:35,681
Yes.

1218
01:30:36,192 --> 01:30:37,721
Then you know that's not true.

1219
01:30:37,926 --> 01:30:39,480
You did everything you could.

1220
01:30:43,001 --> 01:30:44,709
Did you believe in your friend?

1221
01:30:45,296 --> 01:30:46,628
Did you respect him?

1222
01:30:48,219 --> 01:30:49,837
Then stop blaming yourself.

1223
01:30:50,293 --> 01:30:52,454
Allow Barnes the dignity of his choice.

1224
01:30:52,950 --> 01:30:54,716
He damn well must have thought
you were worth it.

1225
01:30:57,382 --> 01:30:58,848
I am going after Schmidt.

1226
01:31:00,561 --> 01:31:03,513
I am not going to stop until all
of Hydra is dead or captured.

1227
01:31:05,838 --> 01:31:07,118
You won't be alone.

1228
01:31:09,899 --> 01:31:13,348
Johann Schmidt belongs in a bughouse.
He thinks he's a god,

1229
01:31:13,379 --> 01:31:15,237
and he's willing to blow up
half the world to prove it,

1230
01:31:15,239 --> 01:31:16,941
starting with the USA.

1231
01:31:16,965 --> 01:31:19,588
Schmidt's working with powers
beyond our capabilities.

1232
01:31:20,177 --> 01:31:21,592
He gets across the Atlantic,

1233
01:31:22,022 --> 01:31:25,100
he will wipe out
the entire Eastern Seaboard in an hour.

1234
01:31:28,990 --> 01:31:30,207
How much time we got?

1235
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:32,858
According to my new best friend,
under 24 hours.

1236
01:31:33,226 --> 01:31:34,202
Where is he now?

1237
01:31:34,204 --> 01:31:35,859
Hydra's last base is here.

1238
01:31:36,827 --> 01:31:39,635
In the Alps, 500 feet below the surface.

1239
01:31:42,389 --> 01:31:43,787
So what are we supposed to do?

1240
01:31:43,889 --> 01:31:46,223
I mean, it's not like
we can just knock on the front door.

1241
01:31:46,783 --> 01:31:47,796
Why not?

1242
01:31:53,352 --> 01:31:54,878
That's exactly what we're going to do.

1243
01:34:01,177 --> 01:34:05,363
Arrogance may not be
a uniquely American trait,

1244
01:34:05,365 --> 01:34:07,761
but I must say,
you do it better than anyone.

1245
01:34:10,226 --> 01:34:12,854
But there are limits

1246
01:34:13,529 --> 01:34:15,493
to what even you can do, Captain.

1247
01:34:15,999 --> 01:34:19,229
Or did Erskine tell you otherwise?

1248
01:34:19,753 --> 01:34:21,291
He told me you were insane.

1249
01:34:25,977 --> 01:34:27,734
He resented my genius

1250
01:34:27,736 --> 01:34:31,228
and tried to deny me
what was rightfully mine.

1251
01:34:31,466 --> 01:34:33,292
But he gave you everything.

1252
01:34:35,251 --> 01:34:36,301
So,

1253
01:34:38,623 --> 01:34:40,847
what made you so special?

1254
01:34:44,310 --> 01:34:45,249
Nothing.

1255
01:34:46,786 --> 01:34:48,167
I am just a kid from Brooklyn.

1256
01:34:59,697 --> 01:35:01,031
I can do this all day.

1257
01:35:01,262 --> 01:35:03,477
Of course you can, of course.

1258
01:35:03,479 --> 01:35:06,545
But, unfortunately,
I am on a tight schedule.

1259
01:35:12,661 --> 01:35:13,735
So am I.

1260
01:35:26,102 --> 01:35:26,759
Rogers.

1261
01:35:28,033 --> 01:35:29,055
You might need this.

1262
01:35:29,728 --> 01:35:30,516
Thanks.

1263
01:35:41,616 --> 01:35:44,105
We're in.
Assault team, go.

1264
01:35:44,441 --> 01:35:45,259
Move out.

1265
01:35:46,389 --> 01:35:47,902
Move.

1266
01:35:54,354 --> 01:35:55,730
Keep your spacing.

1267
01:36:35,938 --> 01:36:37,832
Cut off one head, two more shall...

1268
01:36:39,718 --> 01:36:41,174
Let's go find two more.

1269
01:37:08,137 --> 01:37:09,104
You're late.

1270
01:37:12,047 --> 01:37:14,229
Weren't you about to...
Right.

1271
01:38:28,417 --> 01:38:29,275
Get in.

1272
01:38:58,114 --> 01:38:59,662
Keep it steady.
Wait.

1273
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:06,282
Go get him.

1274
01:39:08,547 --> 01:39:09,818
I am not kissing you.

1275
01:42:49,550 --> 01:42:51,636
You don't give up, do you?

1276
01:42:52,020 --> 01:42:52,769
Nope.

1277
01:44:01,317 --> 01:44:04,018
You could have the power of the gods.

1278
01:44:05,007 --> 01:44:09,419
Yet you wear a flag on your chest
and think you fight a battle of nations.

1279
01:44:10,430 --> 01:44:12,649
I have seen the future, Captain.

1280
01:44:13,274 --> 01:44:14,852
There are no flags.

1281
01:44:15,135 --> 01:44:16,433
Not my future.

1282
01:44:30,348 --> 01:44:31,554
What have you done?

1283
01:44:32,202 --> 01:44:33,169
No.

1284
01:45:41,727 --> 01:45:43,820
<i>Come in. This is Captain Rogers.
Do you read me?</i>

1285
01:45:44,148 --> 01:45:45,934
Captain Rogers, what is your...
Steve, is that you?

1286
01:45:45,936 --> 01:45:46,745
Are you alright?

1287
01:45:46,754 --> 01:45:48,232
<i>Peggy, Schmidt's dead.</i>

1288
01:45:48,918 --> 01:45:50,046
<i>What about the plane?</i>

1289
01:45:52,337 --> 01:45:54,004
That's a little bit tougher to explain.

1290
01:45:54,179 --> 01:45:56,745
Give me your coordinates.
I will find you a safe landing site.

1291
01:45:58,039 --> 01:45:59,689
There's not going to be a safe landing.

1292
01:46:00,216 --> 01:46:01,692
<i>But I can try and force it down.</i>

1293
01:46:01,875 --> 01:46:04,028
Ok I will get Howard on the line.
He will know what to do.

1294
01:46:04,030 --> 01:46:05,028
<i>There's not enough time.</i>

1295
01:46:05,195 --> 01:46:07,700
<i>This thing's moving too fast
and it's heading for New York.</i>

1296
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:13,944
I got to put her in the water.

1297
01:46:14,505 --> 01:46:17,319
Please, don't do this.
We have time. We can work it out.

1298
01:46:17,699 --> 01:46:18,965
Right now I am in
the middle of nowhere.

1299
01:46:18,967 --> 01:46:21,044
If I wait any longer,
a lot of people are going to die.

1300
01:46:26,595 --> 01:46:27,616
Peggy,

1301
01:46:29,964 --> 01:46:30,899
this is my choice.

1302
01:46:55,124 --> 01:46:56,133
Peggy?

1303
01:46:57,203 --> 01:46:58,122
<i>I am here.</i>

1304
01:47:01,461 --> 01:47:03,537
I am going to need a rain check
on that dance.

1305
01:47:12,384 --> 01:47:13,284
Alright.

1306
01:47:16,825 --> 01:47:19,114
A week, next Saturday,
at the Stork Club.

1307
01:47:20,736 --> 01:47:21,607
You got it.

1308
01:47:23,820 --> 01:47:26,459
<i>8:00 on the dot.
Don't you dare be late.</i>

1309
01:47:27,212 --> 01:47:28,107
<i>Understood?</i>

1310
01:47:29,977 --> 01:47:31,922
You know, I still don't know how to dance.

1311
01:47:38,393 --> 01:47:39,639
I will show you how.

1312
01:47:40,242 --> 01:47:41,357
Just be there.

1313
01:47:42,636 --> 01:47:44,500
We will have the band
play something slow.

1314
01:47:48,243 --> 01:47:49,580
<i>I'd hate to step on your...</i>

1315
01:47:52,848 --> 01:47:53,695
Steve?

1316
01:47:56,710 --> 01:47:57,540
Steve?

1317
01:48:01,233 --> 01:48:02,148
Steve?

1318
01:49:01,283 --> 01:49:02,543
To the Captain.

1319
01:49:15,156 --> 01:49:15,722
Sir?

1320
01:49:26,358 --> 01:49:27,901
Take us to the next grid point.

1321
01:49:28,451 --> 01:49:30,073
But there is no trace of wreckage.

1322
01:49:31,217 --> 01:49:33,257
And the energy signature stops here.

1323
01:49:34,783 --> 01:49:36,304
Just keep looking.

1324
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:47,256
<i>Curve ball,
high and outside for ball one.</i>

1325
01:50:48,957 --> 01:50:51,653
<i>So the Dodgers are tied, 4-4.</i>

1326
01:50:52,561 --> 01:50:55,081
<i>And the crowd well knows that
with one swing of his bat,</i>

1327
01:50:55,239 --> 01:50:57,938
<i>this fellow's capable of making it
a brand-new game again.</i>

1328
01:50:59,570 --> 01:51:02,388
<i>Just an absolutely gorgeous day
here at Ebbets Field.</i>

1329
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:06,218
<i>The Phillies have managed
to tie it up at 4-4.</i>

1330
01:51:07,563 --> 01:51:09,461
<i>But the Dodgers have three men on.</i>

1331
01:51:14,619 --> 01:51:17,013
<i>Pearson beaned Reiser
in Philadelphia last month.</i>

1332
01:51:17,310 --> 01:51:19,688
<i>Wouldn't the youngster like a hit here
to return the favor?</i>

1333
01:51:20,987 --> 01:51:22,033
<i>Pete leans in.</i>

1334
01:51:22,143 --> 01:51:23,146
<i>Here's the pitch.</i>

1335
01:51:23,319 --> 01:51:24,258
<i>Swung on.</i>

1336
01:51:24,260 --> 01:51:26,563
<i>A line to the right.
And it gets past Rizzo.</i>

1337
01:51:28,230 --> 01:51:29,527
<i>Three runs will score.</i>

1338
01:51:30,030 --> 01:51:31,299
<i>Reiser heads to third.</i>

1339
01:51:31,847 --> 01:51:33,463
<i>Durocher's going to wave him in.</i>

1340
01:51:34,403 --> 01:51:36,701
<i>Here comes the relay,
but they won't get him.</i>

1341
01:51:38,493 --> 01:51:39,396
Good morning.

1342
01:51:41,261 --> 01:51:42,956
Or should I say afternoon?

1343
01:51:44,206 --> 01:51:45,230
Where am I?

1344
01:51:46,229 --> 01:51:48,078
You're in a recovery room
in New York City.

1345
01:51:49,751 --> 01:51:53,209
<i>The Dodgers take the lead, 8-4.
Oh, Dodgers.</i>

1346
01:51:53,752 --> 01:51:55,549
<i>Everyone is on their feet.</i>

1347
01:51:56,107 --> 01:51:59,229
<i>What a game we have here today, folks.
What a game, indeed.</i>

1348
01:51:59,551 --> 01:52:00,691
Where am I really?

1349
01:52:02,109 --> 01:52:03,589
I am afraid I don't understand.

1350
01:52:04,681 --> 01:52:05,554
The game.

1351
01:52:06,315 --> 01:52:08,921
It's from May 1941.
I know, because I was there.

1352
01:52:12,941 --> 01:52:14,909
Now, I am going to ask you again.

1353
01:52:15,943 --> 01:52:16,910
Where am I?

1354
01:52:17,813 --> 01:52:19,466
Captain Rogers.
Who are you?

1355
01:52:26,833 --> 01:52:28,338
Captain Rogers, wait.

1356
01:52:30,365 --> 01:52:32,060
All agents, code 13.

1357
01:52:32,809 --> 01:52:35,260
<i>I repeat.
All agents, code 13.</i>

1358
01:52:55,917 --> 01:52:57,441
At ease, soldier.

1359
01:53:06,257 --> 01:53:09,004
Look, I am sorry about that
little show back there but...

1360
01:53:10,521 --> 01:53:12,978
we thought it best
to break it to you slowly.

1361
01:53:13,654 --> 01:53:14,623
Break what?

1362
01:53:17,335 --> 01:53:18,639
You have been asleep, Cap.

1363
01:53:19,619 --> 01:53:21,187
For almost 70 years.

1364
01:53:36,098 --> 01:53:37,292
You going to be ok?

1365
01:53:38,347 --> 01:53:39,204
Yeah.

1366
01:53:39,819 --> 01:53:40,836
Yeah, I just...

1367
01:53:44,432 --> 01:53:45,654
I had a date.

1368
01:53:46,051 --> 01:53:49,158

<font color="#ffff80"><i>Sync & corrections April 2020</i></font>

1369
02:03:07,938 --> 02:03:09,043
Trouble sleeping?

1370
02:03:12,482 --> 02:03:13,779
You're here with a mission, sir?

1371
02:03:14,625 --> 02:03:15,614
I am.

1372
02:03:16,408 --> 02:03:17,949
Trying to get me back in the world?

1373
02:03:19,265 --> 02:03:20,493
Trying to save it.

1374
02:03:29,481 --> 02:03:31,465
You think you're the only
hero in the world?

1375
02:03:45,739 --> 02:03:46,579
Gentlemen?

1376
02:03:47,517 --> 02:03:48,459
You're up.

1377
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:56,007
Got a mean swing.
