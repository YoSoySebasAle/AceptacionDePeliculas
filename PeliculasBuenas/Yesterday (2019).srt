(SIGHS, CHUCKLES) No one knows.

177
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:31,130
It was all over the world.
Electricity flicked off for 12 seconds.

178
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:34,342
You were just unlucky that
at that exact moment a big bus hit you.

179
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,071
You know the weird thing they thought was
gonna happen at midnight when we hit 2000?

Oh, yeah. Y2K.

181
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:43,184
It sort of happened. It was very big news,
which, um, you missed entirely

182
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,145
- because of the bus. Mm-hmm.
- Ah.

183
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:51,359
(CHUCKLES) Right.
I've gotta get back to school.

Thanks for taking such good care of me.

00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,033
You're welcome. I'll come back later.

187
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:04,080
Will you still need me,
will you still feed me when I'm 64?

188
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:06,041
(ELLIE LAUGHS) I don't know.
I'll think about it.

189
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,667

was a message from God.

- (SCOFFS)
- Yeah, he was very angry.

197
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,602
Ellie, you think me getting hit by a bus

198
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,664
was God's way of telling me
not to go back to teaching.

199
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:32,859
(LAUGHS) Exactly. Incredible.
It's amazing. God loves your stuff.

200

Look, if God had been
remotely interested in my stuff,

201
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,864
he would've once, right, just once,

202
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,949
had someone write me a fan letter
who wasn't my mum.

- Come on, go.

1187
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:06,072
- (LINE RINGING)
- (COUGHS)

1188
01:05:06,781 --> 01:05:08,407
Come on, pick up. Pick up.

1189
01:05:08,449 --> 01:05:09,492
ELLIE: <i>Hello?</i>

1190
01:05:09,534 --> 01:05:10,743
(PANTING) Oh. Yes! I...

1191
01:05:10,785 --> 01:05:13,955
I came after you, but I missed the train.

1192
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:16,999
I'm sorry. We need to talk.

1193
01:05:17,041 --> 01:05:18,334
<i>Let's talk.</i>

1194
01:05:18,376 --> 01:05:20,086
- Where are you?
<i>- Right behind you.</i>

1195
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:22,547
<i>Having a cheese-and-tomato baguette
and a packet of crisps.</i>

1196
01:05:23,381 --> 01:05:24,507
(LAUGHS)

1197
01:05:29,136 --> 01:05:31,681
ROCKY: Jack,
would it be annoying of me to point out

1198
01:05:31,722 --> 01:05:33,033
we should be heading for the airport?

1199
01:05:33,057 --> 01:05:35,351
- How long have we got?
- In real terms, minus an hour.

1200
01:05:39,689 --> 01:05:40,982
(PANTING) Okay... (EXHALES)

1201
01:05:41,858 --> 01:05:44,127
Rocky, this is completely not
a conversation you're part of.

1202
01:05:44,151 --> 01:05:46,821
- Of course it's not. No, deeply private.
- Yeah.

1203
01:05:46,863 --> 01:05:49,758
With your future happiness at stake.
Did you two sleep together last night?

1204
01:05:49,782 --> 01:05:50,908
- No.
- No.

1205
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:53,178
What a waste! Well, anyway,
I'll keep an eye on the clock.

1206
01:05:53,202 --> 01:05:55,413
You've got precisely four minutes.

1207
01:05:59,041 --> 01:06:00,501
- (BOTH) So.
- (PHONE CHIMES)

1208
01:06:01,961 --> 01:06:03,045
Um...

1209
01:06:04,338 --> 01:06:05,590
It's about last night.

1210
01:06:06,174 --> 01:06:07,550
(SIGHS) What about it?

1211
01:06:08,009 --> 01:06:10,386
Well, it was almost quite a moment.

1212
01:06:10,428 --> 01:06:13,014
And I woke up and I panicked,
and I wanted to talk.

1213
01:06:13,055 --> 01:06:14,515
Okay, then talk.

1214
01:06:15,933 --> 01:06:17,894
Right, so, um...

1215
01:06:20,938 --> 01:06:21,981
(SIGHS)

1216
01:06:22,773 --> 01:06:24,066
'Cause we, uh...

1217
01:06:24,108 --> 01:06:26,611
- How do you think it's going so far?
- It's not great, but...

1218
01:06:26,652 --> 01:06:28,362
No. Let me try and help.

1219
01:06:30,156 --> 01:06:32,366
(EXHALES) You've had 20 years
to make your move.

1220
01:06:34,076 --> 01:06:36,162
I couldn't exactly make my move
when I was seven.

1221
01:06:37,246 --> 01:06:39,999
(STAMMERS) Then you've had ten years.

1222
01:06:40,041 --> 01:06:42,752
Right, but we've always been
like brother and sister.

1223
01:06:43,252 --> 01:06:45,796
And it's very bad indeed for...

1224
01:06:46,881 --> 01:06:48,382
for brothers and sisters to have sex.

1225
01:06:48,424 --> 01:06:49,818
Except we're not brother and sister.

1226
01:06:49,842 --> 01:06:52,178
- No, exactly right, but...
- No, so...

1227
01:06:53,054 --> 01:06:57,266
(EXHALES) I have been waiting half my life
for you to wake up and love me.

1228
01:07:02,063 --> 01:07:04,315
Having loved you for half a lifetime,

1229
01:07:04,357 --> 01:07:07,068
I realized when you left
that I had made a bad choice doing that.

1230
01:07:08,778 --> 01:07:10,655
And now it's got even trickier, because...

1231
01:07:12,657 --> 01:07:15,660
(CHUCKLES) ...when you were playing
in pubs, we were the perfect match.

1232
01:07:15,701 --> 01:07:16,786
But now...

1233
01:07:17,495 --> 01:07:18,913
I... (SIGHS)

1234
01:07:19,747 --> 01:07:22,208
I'm an actual schoolteacher
in actual Lowestoft,

1235
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:24,961
and you're the world's
greatest singer-songwriter.

1236
01:07:25,002 --> 01:07:27,213
- No, I'm not.
- Except that you probably are.

1237
01:07:27,672 --> 01:07:29,691
Okay, two minutes,
ladies and gentlemen. Two minutes.

1238
01:07:29,715 --> 01:07:32,051
Also, um, Debra's on my phone for you.

1239
01:07:32,093 --> 01:07:34,321
Apparently she's having dinner
with the head of the label

1240
01:07:34,345 --> 01:07:35,656
and you're meant to be FaceTiming in.

1241
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,307
- Just go away, Rocky.
- Okay. One minute 53.

1242
01:07:38,349 --> 01:07:42,854
In the end, to you, I'll always
really just be Ellie with the frizzy hair.

1243
01:07:44,313 --> 01:07:46,107
Ellie from the "fun chum" column.

1244
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:49,110
Ellie who, for reasons no one understands,

1245
01:07:49,151 --> 01:07:52,905
drives you around in her car. (CHUCKLES)

1246
01:07:52,947 --> 01:07:56,492
So just go and please
just catch your plane. (SNIFFLES)

1247
01:07:57,785 --> 01:07:59,495
We haven't finished the conversation.

1248
01:07:59,912 --> 01:08:01,998
Well... we have.

1249
01:08:03,624 --> 01:08:04,750
We have.

1250
01:08:06,002 --> 01:08:07,378
Unless...

1251
01:08:08,588 --> 01:08:12,925
in Liverpool Lime Street
at 11:14 on a Friday...

1252
01:08:13,551 --> 01:08:17,180
(BREATHES SHAKILY)
...unless you choose to stay.

1253
01:08:25,479 --> 01:08:26,814
(DEBRA OVER PHONE) <i>Jack!</i>

1254
01:08:26,856 --> 01:08:30,526
<i>Jack, you have to get on the plane.
What are you still doing in Liverpool?</i>

1255
01:08:30,568 --> 01:08:32,236
I can't stay today.

1256
01:08:32,278 --> 01:08:34,488
I've gotta do <i>The Late Late Show</i> tomorrow,

1257
01:08:34,530 --> 01:08:37,283
and I've gotta do the marketing
meeting of meetings, it's ridiculous.

1258
01:08:37,325 --> 01:08:38,701
And that was your chance.

1259
01:08:39,869 --> 01:08:42,705
(CHUCKLES) Now quick, go, please. Leave.

1260
01:08:43,664 --> 01:08:44,707
Sorry.

1261
01:08:44,749 --> 01:08:46,560
Do you mind if I nick
a couple of crisps for the journey?

1262
01:08:46,584 --> 01:08:49,670
I want you to be happy
and to make marvelous music.

1263
01:08:49,712 --> 01:08:51,214
I always have.

1264
01:08:51,255 --> 01:08:53,132
- No! Not all the crisps!
- Okay.

1265
01:08:53,174 --> 01:08:54,759
Just go, go, go.

1266
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:58,721
Your future is out the door
and to the left, a taxi rank.

1267
01:09:05,686 --> 01:09:06,729
JACK: I'm sorry.

1268
01:09:06,771 --> 01:09:08,856
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1269
01:09:21,994 --> 01:09:26,749
MAN: Okay. Welcome to the major
marketing meeting of meetings.

1270
01:09:26,791 --> 01:09:30,378
So amazing to have Jack himself
right here in the building.

1271
01:09:30,419 --> 01:09:32,579
- Give it up for Jack, y'all.
- (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

1272
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:42,306
Now, uh, Jack, I do believe I speak for
everyone in attendance today when I say...

1273
01:09:42,765 --> 01:09:46,644
(WHISTLES, CHUCKLES)
...it is the climax of our careers

1274
01:09:46,686 --> 01:09:50,606
to be working
on this mind-bending album with you.

1275
01:09:50,648 --> 01:09:51,858
Give it up, y'all.

1276
01:09:51,899 --> 01:09:53,693
(CHEERING)

1277
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,403
MAN: Yeah!

1278
01:09:56,612 --> 01:09:59,240
You don't have to clap every time,
but thanks very much.

1279
01:09:59,282 --> 01:10:00,867
- (LAUGHTER)
- Mr. Modesty!

1280
01:10:01,158 --> 01:10:03,119
- Give it up for modesty.
- No, seriously.

1281
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:05,663
That's what he does, right off the top.
(CHUCKLES)

1282
01:10:05,705 --> 01:10:08,457
Now, as you all know,
the songs we released online

1283
01:10:08,499 --> 01:10:11,544
have created unprecedented excitement.

1284
01:10:11,586 --> 01:10:12,628
- (CHEERING)
- Yeah!

1285
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:14,005
No.

1286
01:10:14,589 --> 01:10:18,134
So, now upon us falls the mighty task

1287
01:10:18,176 --> 01:10:24,140
of packaging everything together
into one single, irresistible album.

1288
01:10:24,182 --> 01:10:27,185
Now, Jack came up
with some title suggestions himself

1289
01:10:27,226 --> 01:10:29,979
and... (CHUCKLES)
we worked on some of those.

1290
01:10:30,021 --> 01:10:32,064
You know, I especially
got a kick out of...

1291
01:10:32,565 --> 01:10:35,526
<i>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.</i>

1292
01:10:35,568 --> 01:10:37,278
- (LAUGHTER)
- Yeah, that's... (CHUCKLES)

1293
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:38,988
It's okay to laugh, 'cause it's funny.

1294
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:42,658
- (LAUGHTER CONTINUES)
- It is. It's a lot of words, Jack.

1295
01:10:42,700 --> 01:10:47,038
But ultimately, in the end,
we just felt it was, uh... too confusing.

1296
01:10:47,371 --> 01:10:48,724
- (CROWD) Hmm.
- All right? Too confusing.

1297
01:10:48,748 --> 01:10:51,250
And, uh, <i>The White Album...</i>

1298
01:10:51,792 --> 01:10:53,544
has some diversity issues.

1299
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:55,796
How?

1300
01:10:56,797 --> 01:10:58,966
That's a lot of white, Jack.

1301
01:10:59,008 --> 01:11:04,305
And I know you were pretty enthusiastic
about <i>Abbey Road.</i>

1302
01:11:04,347 --> 01:11:06,724
I gotta say,
it didn't have a lot going for it.

1303
01:11:06,766 --> 01:11:08,406
If I could put it to you like that. Uh...

1304
01:11:09,018 --> 01:11:12,247
It's just a road with a bunch of people
driving down the wrong side of the street.

1305
01:11:12,271 --> 01:11:13,731
- (CHUCKLES)
- (LAUGHTER)

1306
01:11:13,773 --> 01:11:15,191
That's not exactly what I meant.

1307
01:11:15,233 --> 01:11:17,211
But we've been developing
some ideas of our own now, you know?

1308
01:11:17,235 --> 01:11:18,420
We weren't just sitting around.

1309
01:11:18,444 --> 01:11:22,365
We focused on the one thing
that makes this man here

1310
01:11:22,406 --> 01:11:26,035
unlike anyone else
in the entire world of music today.

1311
01:11:26,077 --> 01:11:28,162
No collaborators, no cowriters.

1312
01:11:28,204 --> 01:11:30,122
No samples, no steals. Hmm?

1313
01:11:30,164 --> 01:11:32,500
No "featuring Cardi B."

1314
01:11:32,875 --> 01:11:35,002
No "featuring Bieber."

1315
01:11:35,294 --> 01:11:38,256
Just the simple, pure genius...

1316
01:11:39,549 --> 01:11:40,591
of <i>One Man Only.</i>

1317
01:11:40,633 --> 01:11:42,802
- (GASPING)
- (CHATTERING)

1318
01:11:42,844 --> 01:11:45,638
Mmm-mmm-mmm. And as a second wave,

1319
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:49,016
because of the miracle
that is <i>One Man Only...</i>

1320
01:11:49,976 --> 01:11:51,018
it's just this.

1321
01:11:51,978 --> 01:11:53,771
- (CROWD GASPING)
- Just this.

1322
01:11:54,188 --> 01:11:57,358
- Mmm-mmm. I know, I know.
- (APPLAUSE)

1323
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,652
So let Operation Jack begin!

1324
01:11:59,694 --> 01:12:01,946
- (CHEERING)
- Each week, a new song online.

1325
01:12:01,988 --> 01:12:03,447
Each week, a new TV show.

1326
01:12:03,489 --> 01:12:05,783
We start with Corden,
then we move to Kimmel,

1327
01:12:05,825 --> 01:12:07,410
then Fallon, then Colbert,

1328
01:12:07,451 --> 01:12:12,081
and then <i>Thursday Night Live!</i> Whoo!

1329
01:12:12,123 --> 01:12:16,085
Song, song, song. Show, show, show.
Boom, bang, bazillions.

1330
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:19,797
Now let's go make so much money
that by this time next Christmas,

1331
01:12:19,839 --> 01:12:22,800
we are wiping our asses
with solid gold toilet paper!

1332
01:12:22,842 --> 01:12:26,429
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
the one, the only, Mr. Jack Malik!

1333
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:28,764
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

1334
01:12:28,806 --> 01:12:30,975
CORDEN: <i>Jack, I'm such a fan.
It's great to meet you.</i>

1335
01:12:31,017 --> 01:12:32,268
<i>Thank you for being here.</i>

1336
01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:35,354
<i>The songs of yours that I've heard,
they are... they are amazing.</i>

1337
01:12:35,396 --> 01:12:37,249
What's life like for you at the moment
right now?

1338
01:12:37,273 --> 01:12:42,153
I mean, the expectation for the album
is just rising to insane levels, isn't it?

1339
01:12:42,195 --> 01:12:43,738
Yeah, well, they're insane to me.

1340
01:12:43,779 --> 01:12:45,865
I mean, who here's excited
about this album?

1341
01:12:45,907 --> 01:12:48,034
- Listen to that.
- (AUDIENCE CHEERING)

1342
01:12:48,075 --> 01:12:52,830
In this age of sometimes 16 people
writing on one song,

1343
01:12:52,872 --> 01:12:54,498
suddenly, here's a guy,

1344
01:12:54,999 --> 01:12:58,878
him and a guitar, and he writes
everything himself on his own.

1345
01:12:59,212 --> 01:13:01,690
Yeah, I mean... You know,
that's how it always used to be, though,

1346
01:13:01,714 --> 01:13:05,259
with, like, James Taylor,
or Stevie Wonder, Bruce Springsteen.

1347
01:13:05,301 --> 01:13:07,053

01:13:17,563 --> 01:13:20,900
Excellent. Because as chance
would have it, and do forgive me,

1354

1355

1378
01:14:34,599 --> 01:14:37,977
But like, with this song for instance,
the, um, the "Hey Jude" one

1379
01:14:38,019 --> 01:14:40,021
must have some story behind it.

Well, yeah. No, it does.

1381
01:14:42,273 --> 01:14:45,651
So, it was the son of a friend of mine,

1382
01:14:46,235 --> 01:14:47,904
who was having a hard time.

1383
01:14:47,945 --> 01:14:53,910

1388
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:09,550
I do have a suggestion, though, um...

1389
01:15:10,301 --> 01:15:13,304
about the song, the title "Hey Jude,"

1390
01:15:13,346 --> 01:15:16,140
"Jude" is just...
it's a bit old-fashioned.

1391
01:15:16,182 --> 01:15:17,600
That was the kid's name, right?

1392
01:15:18,184 --> 01:15:19,936

- That the song's about.
