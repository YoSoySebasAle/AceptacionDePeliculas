1
00:00:51,052 --> 00:00:53,304
When you love someone,
you’ve gotta trust them.

2
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,181
There’s no other way.

3
00:00:55,473 --> 00:00:59,352
You’ve got to give them the key to everything that’s yours.

4
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:01,604
Otherwise, what's the point?

5
00:01:03,648 --> 00:01:07,526
And, for a while,
I believed that’s the kind oflove I had.

6
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,471
FIREWORKS EXPLODING

7
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:17,531
Before I ever ran a casino,
or got myself blown up,

8
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:21,452
Ace Rothstein was a hell of a handicapper,
I can tell you that.

9
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:23,579
I was so good
that whenever! Bet,

10
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:26,290
I could change the odds for every bookmaker in the country.

11
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:30,836
I had it down so cold that I was given paradise on Earth.

12
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:34,673
I was given one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas to run,

13
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:36,467
the Tangiers,

14
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,096
by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money,

15
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:43,140
$62, 700, 000.

16
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:45,226
I don't know all the details.

17
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:49,563
Nobody knew all the details,
but it should have been perfect.

18
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:51,649
I mean,
he had me, Nicky Santoro,

19
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:53,859
his best friend,
watching his ass

20
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,822
and he had, Ginger,
the woman he loved, on his arm.

21
00:03:58,406 --> 00:04:01,117
But in the end,
we fucked it all up.

22
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:03,244
It should've
been so sweet, too.

23
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:06,747
But it turned out to be the last time that street guys like us

24
00:04:06,831 --> 00:04:09,792
were ever given anything
that fucking valuable again.

25
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:17,174
At that time,
Vegas was a place where millions of suckers

26
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:19,176
flew in every year
on their own nickel

27
00:04:19,343 --> 00:04:21,303
and left behind
about a billion dollars.

28
00:04:21,554 --> 00:04:25,683
But at night,
you couldn't see the desert that surrounds Las Vegas.

29
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,061
But it's in the desert

30
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:31,105
where lots of the town '3
problems are solved.

31
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:33,357
Got a lot of holes
in the desert

32
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:35,776
and a lot of problems are
buried in those holes.

33
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:38,362
Except you gotta do it right.

34
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:40,364
You gotta have
the hole already dug

35
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:42,408
before you show
up with a package.

36
00:04:42,575 --> 00:04:44,452
Otherwise,
you're talking about

37
00:04:44,577 --> 00:04:46,454
a half hour or
45 minutes of digging.

38
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:49,081
And who knows
who's gonna be coming along?

39
00:04:49,165 --> 00:04:52,042
Before you know it,
you gotta dig a few more holes.

40
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:54,712
You could be there
all fucking night.

41
00:04:58,299 --> 00:04:59,300
HORNS HONKING

42
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:12,688
Who could resist?

43
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,483
Anywhere else in the country
I was a bookie, a gambler,

44
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:17,151
always looking
over my shoulder,

45
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:18,903
hassled by cops,
day and night.

46
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,905
But here, I'm Mr. Rothstein.

47
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,949
I'm not only legitimate
but running a casino

48
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:27,161
and that’s like selling people dreams for cash.

49
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,997
I hired an old casino pal,
Billy Sherbert,

50
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,333
as my manager
and I went to work.

51
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,669
...and this is Ronnie who takes care of the card room.

52
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,300
For guys like me,
Las Vegas washes away your sins.

53
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,302
It’s like
a morality car wash.

54
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:47,097
It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples.

55
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:56,106
And along with
making us legit

56
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:58,734
comes cash, tons of it.

57
00:05:59,068 --> 00:06:01,779
What do you think we’re doing
in the middle of the desert?

58
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,614
It's all this money.

59
00:06:04,657 --> 00:06:08,869
This is the end result of all the bright lights and the comp trips,

60
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:12,289
of all the champagne
and free hotel suites

61
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:14,875
and all the broads
and all the booze.

62
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,837
It's all been arranged just for us to get your money.

63
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:23,008
That’s the truth
about Las Vegas.

64
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:26,053
We 're the only winners.

65
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,305
The players
don't stand a chance.

66
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,724
And their cash
flows from the tables

67
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:33,727
to our boxes,
through the cage

68
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:36,397
and into the most sacred room
in the casino.

69
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:39,942
The place where they
add up all the money,

70
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,403
the holy of holies,
the count room.

71
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,366
Now,
this place was off-limits,

72
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,618
even I couldn't get inside,
but it was myjob

73
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,912
to keep it filled with cash,
that’s for sure.

74
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:54,331
They had so much
fucking money in there

75
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:56,792
you could build
a house out of $100 bills.

76
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,211
And the best part was that the Board of Directors

77
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,672
didn't know what was going on.

78
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,841
I mean,
to them everything looked on the up-and—up.

79
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,634
Right? Wrong.

80
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:06,969
Verify $5,000.

81
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,679
The guys inside
the counting room

82
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,849
were all slipped in there
to skim the joint dry.

83
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,561
They'd do short counts,
they'd lose fill slips.

84
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:18,230
They'd even take cash
right out of the drop boxes.

85
00:07:18,314 --> 00:07:20,274
And it was up
to this guy here,

86
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,359
standing in front
of about $2 million,

87
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:25,654
to skim the cash off the top
without anybody getting wise,

88
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:27,531
the IRS or anybody.

89
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:31,535
Notice how in the count room nobody ever seems to see anything.

90
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,537
Somebody's always
looking the other way.

91
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:35,956
Look at these guys.
They look busy, right?

92
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,249
They're counting money.

93
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:38,584
Who wants to bother them?

94
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:42,129
God forbid,
they should make a mistake and forget to steal.

95
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,923
Meanwhile,
you're in and you're out.

96
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:48,844
Past the jag-off guard who gets an extra C-note a week

97
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,471
just to watch the door.

98
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:53,223
I mean, it's routine,
business as usual.

99
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:55,976
In, out, hello, goodbye.

100
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,394
That’s all there is to it.

101
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:00,898
Just another fat fuck walking out ofthe casino with a suitcase.

102
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,860
That suitcase was going straight to one place,

103
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:06,820
right to Kansas City,

104
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,405
which was as
close to Las Vegas

105
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:10,115
as the Midwest
bosses could go

106
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,242
without getting arrested.

107
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:16,372
That suitcase was all the bosses ever wanted

108
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:19,208
and they wanted
it every month.

109
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,507
Now,
this old Mormon fuck here,

110
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,344
he had to fly in with suitcases once a month,
nice and easy.

111
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:31,595
Something
smells good.

112
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:32,930
They made us
something to eat.

113
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,140
The bosses came from
all over the place,

114
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:37,434
Detroit,
Cle veland, Milwaukee,

115
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:39,353
all over the Midwest.

116
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,606
And they would meet in this produce market in Kansas City.

117
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,358
I mean, nobody even knew it.

118
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,944
One ofthe guys made his mother do all the cooking.

119
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,446
You ever see
that Jerry Steriano?

120
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:53,325
Now, these old greaseballs might not look it,
but believe me,

121
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:56,370
these are the guys who secretly control Las Vegas.

122
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,038
Mama, that man's here again.

123
00:08:58,122 --> 00:09:00,582
Because they control
the Teamsters Union

124
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:01,959
and that’s where
you had to go

125
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,836
if you wanted to borrow
money to buy a casino.

126
00:09:06,422 --> 00:09:10,092
Nobody got a Teamsters' loan
unless the guys in this room

127
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:13,095
knew they were gonna get
their little suitcases.

128
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:16,890
Guys like this antique over here,
out of Detroit.

129
00:09:18,434 --> 00:09:21,979
Or especially guys like Remo Gaggi,
the outfit’s top boss.

130
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,397
You got a round figure on it?

131
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,607
The most important
guy in this room.

132
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:26,900
About 20 pounds.
So?

133
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,277
That's around $700,000.

134
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:29,737
Uh-huh. Good.

135
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,781
I know it's a little
early for Las Vegas,

136
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,451
but I want to
welcome the ladies

137
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,494
and gentlemen of
the gaming industry...

138
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,621
As far as
the world was concerned,

139
00:09:39,705 --> 00:09:42,541
Andy Stone,
the head ofthe Teamsters' pension fund,

140
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,752
was a legitimate guy.

141
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:46,503
A powerful man.

142
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,256
He even played golf
with the President.

143
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:52,593
On behalf of the Teamsters' pension fund,
it's my pleasure...

144
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,344
But Andy also took orders.

145
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:57,389
And when he was told to give
a loan to Philip Green...

146
00:09:57,473 --> 00:10:02,144
...for $62,700,000
for the new Tangiers.

147
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,730
...he did what he was told.

148
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,356
Here was
the perfect front man.

149
00:10:06,482 --> 00:10:08,066
What else could he be?

150
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,778
He didn't want
to know too much,

151
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:13,739
especially that the bosses made the Teamsters lend him the money.

152
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,491
He believed
the Teamsters gave him

153
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,326
that money
'cause he was smart.

154
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:20,871
I know full well how much competition we have in this great city.

155
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,168
And where they
got Green from?

156
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,920
Who the fuck knows?

157
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:31,006
All I know is that Green
was a real estate hustler,

158
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,716
who barely had
enough gas money

159
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,510
to pick up his
own fucking check.

160
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:38,931
And it was the bosses' man,
Andy Stone, who gave all the orders,

161
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:41,642
not the chairman of
the board Philip Green.

162
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,852
I understand. I understand.

163
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:51,235
Now they needed somebody they could trust to run the casino.

164
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,861
And who better than Ace?

165
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:54,863
He was already in
Vegas a couple years

166
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,907
and he had
the fucking place clocked.

167
00:10:57,616 --> 00:11:00,410
But typical Ace,
give him a shot at running a casino

168
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:01,954
and he tries
to talk you out of it.

169
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,789
I don't know if
I could do this.

170
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,958
The Gaming Commission would never give me a license.

171
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,877
I have two dozen gambling
and bookmaking pinches on me.

172
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:12,631
You don't have to have a license to work in a casino.

173
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,675
All you gotta do
is apply for one.

174
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:16,969
State law says you
can work in a casino

175
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:19,304
while they're
processing your application.

176
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:21,014
They got a 10-year backlog.

177
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,766
And when
they do find out?

178
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:24,560
Why would they
want to find out?

179
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:26,478
We're putting $100
million into this desert.

180
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,438
Why lock us out?

181
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:30,440
Besides,
they'll never find out.

182
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:32,442
Just keep
changing yourjob title.

183
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:36,154
Like, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman.

184
00:11:36,238 --> 00:11:40,117
They take your application,
they put it at the bottom of the pile.

185
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,203
I know guys been working there for 30 years don't have a license.

186
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,330
SING, SING, SING PLAYING

187
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:47,583
It's a tough proposition,
Andy.

188
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,251
If I did it,
I'd have to run it my way.

189
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,919
You got it.

190
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:53,255
I'm serious, no interference.

191
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:56,383
Nobody's gonna interfere
with you running the casino.

192
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:57,885
I guarantee it.

193
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:01,013
SINGING Everybody start to sing La-di—da

194
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:03,599
And that’s how they
gotAce to take over.

195
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:07,769
They wanted him because Ace ate,
slept and breathed gambling.

196
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,525
They worked out
a real cute job title, too,

197
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:16,194
Tangiers Public
Relations Director.

198
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:18,947
But the only thing he ever directed was the casino.

199
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:24,077
He made his first bet when he was 15 and he always made money.

200
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,705
But he didn't
bet like you or me,

201
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,707
having some fun with it,
shit like that.

202
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,084
Where the hell did
you learn how to deal?

203
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:33,629
He bet like
a fucking brain surgeon.

204
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,380
Place the checks properly.

205
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,049
That's the way you do it.

206
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:39,051
He had to know everything.

207
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:41,845
He 'd find out the inside stuff nobody else knew

208
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:44,306
and that’s what
he'd put his money on.

209
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:49,895
Even back home, years ago,
when we were first hanging out together,

210
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:52,356
he'd know if
the quarterback was on coke...

211
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,899
I'll take Columbia for 20.

212
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,484
...if his
girlfriend was knocked up.

213
00:12:56,318 --> 00:12:59,196
He 'd get the wind velocity,
so he could judge the field goals.

214
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:02,199
He even figured out
the different bounce you got

215
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:05,827
off different kinds of wood they used on college basketball courts.

216
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:07,746
He 'd work on this
shit day and night.

217
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:10,290
There was nothing about a game he didn't know.

218
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:13,001
Ace got down at six.
Get me down at six.

219
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:18,173
Season after season,
the prick was the only winner I ever knew,

220
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,008
but he was so
serious about it all,

221
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,843
I don't think he
ever enjoyed himself.

222
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:24,221
But that’s just
the way he was.

223
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:27,933
But back then,
the bosses didn't give a fuck

224
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:29,643
about if he enjoyed himself
ornot

225
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,187
To them,
he was a cash register.

226
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,440
All they had to do was ring the bell and take money.

227
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:38,568
Especially Remo,
who was a fucking degenerate gambler

228
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:39,903
who always lost.

229
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:41,655
MUTTERING

230
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:43,323
All those fucking sweeps.

231
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:45,117
I mean,
unless Ace made his bets.

232
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,493
Enough now!

233
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,287
Ace made more money for them on a weekend

234
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:51,999
than I could do
heisting joints for a month.

235
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,877
Whatever Ace picked up on the street,
he told Remo.

236
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:58,964
I mean,
fixed fights, doped horses,

237
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:02,300
crooked fucking zebras,
locked-in point spreads.

238
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:04,136
He told fucking
Remo everything.

239
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:06,888
And to tell you the truth,
I don't blame him.

240
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:10,183
Keeping Remo
happy with money

241
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,561
was the greatest
insurance policy in the world.

242
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,813
Son of a bitch!

243
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:17,149
How the hell
did you get Oklahoma-Michigan?

244
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:18,525
Nobody ever had that.

245
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,943
How the hell did you do it?

246
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,903
That's why they paid so well.

247
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,947
You see?
He never tells me nothing.

248
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:26,074
Ace, what do we
got on for next week?

249
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:28,660
Well, it's a little too early.
I'd say Thursday would be good.

250
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:29,870
Is that all right?

251
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:32,164
Okay. You come by the house?
I'll come by.

252
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:33,749
At 7:00.
7:00.

253
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:37,169
Good job, my boy.
Keep it up, okay, Ace?

254
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,004
Hey, Nicky.

255
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,339
I'll be right out.

256
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:43,800
Nicky, see that guy?

257
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,510
Keep a good eye on him.

258
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:47,637
He's making
a lot of money for us

259
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,931
and he's gonna continue
making a lot of money for us,

260
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,183
so keep a good eye on him.

261
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,935
Not like the fucking Feds out there,
without brains.

262
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,479
Okay?
All right.

263
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,148
Want me to take this?

264
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,442
Now,
on top of everything else,

265
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:03,195
I gotta make sure nobody fucks with the Golden Jew.

266
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,031
Chase, couple of
shooters for the ladies.

267
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:08,575
Yeah, we made a great pair.

268
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,370
I made book and Nicky made sure we always collected.

269
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:14,915
The old men loved us,
and why not?

270
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:17,042
They all made money with us.

271
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:19,836
How did Nicky collect?
Don ’1‘ ask.

272
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,880
Where the fuck is the money?

273
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:25,217
Hi, Melissa, Heidi.
Hi, Sam.

274
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,719
Who's this guy?

275
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:28,845
Itwas nine. I laid nine.

276
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,055
It was eight.

277
00:15:30,138 --> 00:15:32,849
Ace, tell him
the line on the Bear game.

278
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:34,684
Eight.

279
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,311
If he don't know,
nobody knows.

280
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:37,437
Told you it was eight.

281
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:38,605
How come I laid nine?

282
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,148
'Cause you're a jag-off.

283
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:41,733
Excuse me.

284
00:15:41,817 --> 00:15:43,360
What?
Is this yours?

285
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,113
Yeah, that's my pen. Why?

286
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:48,156
It's a nice pen.
I didn't know whose it was.

287
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:50,200
I didn't want it to get lost.

288
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,786
Well, thank you.
Why don't you take that pen

289
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:55,413
and shove it up your ass,
fucking jag-off?

290
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,501
I was just...
Fucking asshole.

291
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,086
Look out, Joe.

292
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:02,838
WOMAN SHRIEKING

293
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:05,507
NICKY GRUNTING

294
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:15,475
MAN GROANING IN PAIN

295
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:21,982
MAN WHIMPERING

296
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,526
What's that? You hear
a little girl, Frankie?

297
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:27,154
Hear a little girl, Ace?
Is that a little girl?

298
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,822
What happened to
the fucking tough guy

299
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,866
told my friend to stick it
up his fucking ass?

300
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,952
Nicky, take it easy. Nicky.

301
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:36,413
MAN WHIMPERING

302
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,629
While I was trying to figure out why the guy was saying this,

303
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,298
Nicky just hit him.

304
00:16:46,381 --> 00:16:49,801
No matter how big a guy was,
Nicky would take him on.

305
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:53,221
You beat Nicky with fists,
he comes back with a bat.

306
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,683
You beat him with a knife,
he comes back with a gun.

307
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:59,644
And ifyou beat him with a gun,
you better kill him,

308
00:16:59,728 --> 00:17:04,065
because he'll keep coming back and back until one ofyou is dead.

309
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,452
Listen,
with me protecting Ace,

310
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,579
he made
a fortune for the bosses.

311
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:21,583
I mean,
that’s what got him to Vegas.

312
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,711
He was a money machine.

313
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:27,964
A tremendous
earner for these guys.

314
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,509
As soon as he took over,
he doubled the fucking drop.

315
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:34,804
With Ace,
the casino never saw so much money.

316
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:36,681
And the bosses,
they couldn't be happier.

317
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,141
HOOCHIE COOCHIE MAN
PLAYING

318
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,893
SINGING
I got seven hundred dollars

319
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:42,062
And don't you mess with me

320
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,522
But you know I'm here

321
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:50,237
Everybody knows I'm here

322
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:58,995
In Vegas,
Ihad to keep a few juiced-in local cowboys working.

323
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,790
They were close to the,
you know, good old boys.

324
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:06,002
Without us, these guys,
they’d still be shoveling mule shit.

325
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:07,879
You gotta keep
a cleaner station.

326
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:09,798
Ifyou need Mr. Clean,
page him, all right?

327
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:11,424
Won't happen
again, Sam.

328
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:13,468
Mr. Rothstein.

329
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,553
Won't happen again,
Mr. Rothstein.

330
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,055
Is this guyjust
a dumb fucking white man?

331
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,640
What's the story?

332
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:19,808
You need him.

333
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:21,059
I can't get rid of him?

334
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:23,270
He's the County
Commissioner's cousin.

335
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:25,522
Iwouldn't give
the burn a mop job.

336
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,816
I had no choice,
I had to take care ofthem.

337
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,818
These yoke/s ran the state.

338
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:33,905
They passed the laws,
they owned the courts.

339
00:18:33,989 --> 00:18:35,824
Hey, I need a room.
Good to see you.

340
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:39,577
I had dozens of politicians and officials in that place every week.

341
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:41,663
Get the Senator
whatever he wants.

342
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,707
Why not make them happy?

343
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:46,251
...the Presidential suite.

344
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:58,263
For politicians like our state senator up there,

345
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,098
everything was on the house.

346
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,559
These guys won their comp life when they got elected,

347
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,978
so why not take
advantage ofit?

348
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:09,357
Still, the politicians came cheap,
we could handle them.

349
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:12,694
It's a whale
like K. K. Ichikawa

350
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,030
who plays $30,000
a hand in baccarat,

351
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:17,073
that’s the one
you gotta watch.

352
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:19,492
He plays fast and big,
and he has the cash

353
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,953
and the credit
to turn out your lights.

354
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:25,623
A year ago,
he cleaned out a couple of casinos in the Cayman Islands.

355
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,501
Downstairs he takes us
for $2 million

356
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:32,213
and upstairs he takes free soap,
shampoo and towels.

357
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,967
A billionaire Cheapskate
who loved his free rooms,

358
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:39,137
free private jets
and $2 million of our money.

359
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,140
But we got him back.

360
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,726
I had our pilot tell him
the plane was on the fritz.

361
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,436
I don't know what went wrong.

362
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,188
I'm awfully sorry.
I can't understand it.

363
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:50,231
These mechanical
things happen.

364
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:52,275
Hey, but better
here than up there.

365
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:55,320
He missed the commercial flights to Japan.

366
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:56,571
I can't believe it...

367
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:57,781
What can I do?

368
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:06,247
We got him back with a whole floor of rooms to himself.

369
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:07,791
I am sorry.

370
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,167
Maybe, you get my money back.

371
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,877
No, no gambling.

372
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:16,633
And once he was back,
he played small.

373
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:22,972
He bet $1,000 a hand instead of his usual $30,000 a hand.

374
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:26,017
...to the bank with
a natural eight over a five.

375
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:29,521
But I knew the trick
with whales like Ichikawa

376
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:32,232
was that they can't
bet small for long.

377
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:34,401
He didn’t think of
it as winning $10,000,

378
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:36,945
he thought ofit
as losing $90, 000.

379
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,739
So he upped his bets.

380
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:45,954
Until he dropped
his winnings back

381
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,248
and gave up $1 million
of his own cash.

382
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:53,128
In a casino, the cardinal
rule is to keep them

383
00:20:53,253 --> 00:20:55,380
playing and keep
them coming back.

384
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,424
The longer they play,
the more they lose.

385
00:20:57,507 --> 00:20:58,967
In the end, we get it all.

386
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:00,385
COMPARED TO WHAT PLAYING

387
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:01,719
SINGING
God damn it

388
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:04,556
Trying to make it
real compared to what?

389
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:08,184
Sock it to me

390
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:12,730
In Vegas,
everybody’s gotta watch everybody else.

391
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,859
Six.
Who's gonna give me that?

392
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:19,112
Since the players are looking to beat the casino,

393
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:21,865
the dealers are
watching the players.

394
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,158
Six!

395
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:24,409
Make the six.

396
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:27,078
The boxmen are
watching the dealers.

397
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:29,747
The floormen are
watching the boxmen.

398
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:32,834
The pit bosses are
watching the floormen.

399
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:35,920
The shift bosses
are watching the pit bosses.

400
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:38,923
The casino manager
is watching the shift bosses.

401
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:41,176
I 'm watching
the casino manager.

402
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:44,512
And the eye in the sky
is watching us all.

403
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,145
Plus, we had a dozen guys up there,
most of them eX-cheats,

404
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,564
who knew every
trick in the house.

405
00:22:02,197 --> 00:22:04,949
SINGING Trying to make it real compared to what?

406
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,378
Yes!
Thank you. Very nice.

407
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,172
I told you I was hot tonight.

408
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,228
Looking good.

409
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:35,522
Let's go, this is for Ginger.

410
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:37,232
Let me have $100
on the hard 10.

411
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,025
Thank you.

412
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,401
Hard 10.

413
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:41,569
SINGING
Here we go now.

414
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,206
Oh, I'm sorry.

415
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:54,415
Sorry, the dice.

416
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:58,044
Thank you very much.

417
00:22:58,169 --> 00:22:59,462
Thank you very much.

418
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:01,005
Thank you, sir.

419
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,257
You were great.

420
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,175
Take care, Steve.
Take chances, drive fast.

421
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,177
Thank you very much.

422
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:08,054
Ginger,
honey, this is for you, love.

423
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:09,973
Thanks for your time.

424
00:23:10,265 --> 00:23:11,266
Come on.

425
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:12,392
What's the matter?

426
00:23:13,351 --> 00:23:16,312
I made a lot of money for you,
I want my cut.

427
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:18,273
I've seen you
stealing from me.

428
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,108
Look at the stack of chips.

429
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:21,317
I want my half.

430
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:22,569
I was watching you
all night.

431
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:23,778
I want my money.

432
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:25,071
Your bag is full of chips.

433
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,698
I didn't steal
anything from you.

434
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:28,366
Get lost, Ginger. Get lost!

435
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:30,034
- Get lost?
- Yes.

436
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:31,286
Well, how about that?

437
00:23:31,452 --> 00:23:32,495
Come on!

I 've been told

My sweet baby

446
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:05,653
You're the one

447
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:27,008
What a move.
I fell in love right there.

448
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:31,012
But in Vegas, for a girl like Ginger,
love costs money.

449

HEART OF STONE PLAYING

I don't really know

452

No matter how I try

454
00:24:44,692 --> 00:24:46,861
I just can't make her cry

455
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:51,783
Ginger's mission
in life was money.

456
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:53,451
I'll be right back.

457
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:54,911
Okay, thanks for asking.

458
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,788
She was a queen
around the casino.

459
00:24:56,871 --> 00:25:00,249
She brought in high rollers and helped them spend a lot of money.

460
00:25:00,625 --> 00:25:01,709
Hello.

461
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:02,877
Hey, Ginger, how you doing?

462
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,212
Great.
I have something for you.

463
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:05,630
You got me covered?

464
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:07,131
And you do.
Thank you very much.

465
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,675
Take care.

466
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,385
I got some
lucky pills for you.

467
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,803
Yeah.

468
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:14,639
Who didn't want Ginger?
She was one of the best known,

469
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:17,767
bestﬁked and most respected hustlers in town.

470
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:25,108
She could keep a guy awake for two or three days

471
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:26,484
before
sending him home broke

472
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:29,404
to the little woman
and his bank examiners.

473
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:45,461
Any change?

474
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:50,216
Oh, I hit a few games
on the way back.

475
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:54,971
That was all bullshit,
she just pocketed the cash.

476
00:25:57,724 --> 00:25:59,100
How you doing tonight?
- Good.

477
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,144
Beat.
How are you?

478
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:02,937
Ginger had
the hustlers' code.

479
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,147
Take one for you.

480
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:05,398
Thank you.

481
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,608
She knew how to
take care of people

482
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:09,819
and that’s what
Vegas is all about.

483
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:11,237
$6,800.

484
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:12,572
Thanks.

485
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:13,865
It's kickback city.

486
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:15,575
Have a good night.
Thank you. You, too.

487
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:22,623
She took care of
the dealers, pit bosses...

488
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,333
Hey, Mitch.

489
00:26:24,417 --> 00:26:26,294
...floor managers,
but mostly,

490
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:28,296
she took care of
the valet parkers.

491
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:31,632
The guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.

492
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:33,509
Ginger took care of
the parkers

493
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,470
because they took care of
the security guards,

494
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:38,181
who took care of the cops,
who let her operate.

495
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:39,474
I need that stuff tonight.

496
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:40,767
No problem.

497
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,393
You are a doll.

498
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:44,812
The valet parking job
was such a money-maker,

499
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:48,191
they had to pay off the hotel manager just to get the concession.

500
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,236
But one thing
I could never understand

501
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:55,114
was that she could have
everything under control

502
00:26:55,198 --> 00:26:57,742
except for her old pimp boyfriend,
Lester Diamond.

503
00:26:57,825 --> 00:27:01,329
Gin, you know I got other people in this,
I got partners.

504
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:02,413
I want you to
understand

505
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:05,124
that I am looking out for you
in this thing. Okay?

506
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:09,212
You're gonna get yours back and you're gonna get back first.
Okay?

507
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:10,463
All right, yeah.

508
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:11,756
Where you going?

509
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:14,509
Where are you?
You're in that place.

510
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:16,511
I'm here.
No, you're not.

511
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:19,430
Where are you? Where are you?

512
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:21,516
I'm always here for you.

513
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:24,811
You're my woman.
I know.

514
00:27:25,853 --> 00:27:29,190
The Ginger knew wouldn ’1‘ even look at this creep.

515
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:31,526
Yeah.
Good luck.

516
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:34,111
He was a moocher,
a card cheat,

517
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:36,531
a country club golf hustler,
a scumbag,

518
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:37,949
chasing dentists
for a few bucks.

519
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:39,200
Careful.

520
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:41,911
The guy was always broke,
he always had a story,

521
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:44,330
and she could
never turn him down.

522
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:47,792
The way Ginger saw it was that Lester was just an unlucky guy.

523
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,544
Somebody had to
take care of him.

524
00:27:49,544 --> 00:27:50,086
Somebody had to
take care of him.

525
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:53,047
But nobody had to
take care of Nicky.

526
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:56,008
Ifyou find any cash,
we'll whack it up with you.

527
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:58,553
He took care of
himself only too well.

528
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:01,305
That's why every badge back home wanted to nail him.

529
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:03,224
| Folded these
things beautifully

530
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:05,142
and Iwould
appreciate a little respect.

531
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:08,479
Jesus Christ. Don't look at me, pal,
I gotta live with her.

532
00:28:08,563 --> 00:28:11,315
Even after a vacation,
they hassled him at the airport.

533
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:14,318
Frank Marino was there to meet him but so were the cops.

534
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:18,239
This time they wanted him for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.

535
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:20,783
They were ready to
blame him for anything.

536
00:28:20,867 --> 00:28:22,118
Put your things away.

537
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:23,536
They were usually right.

538
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:24,745
Hold it.

539
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:26,289
Nicky enjoyed
being a gangster

540
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:27,915
and he didn't give
a damn who knew it.

541
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:31,711
Come on.
There we go. Look. Beautiful!

542
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,881
That’s what worried me
'cause it turns out

543
00:28:35,006 --> 00:28:37,258
Nicky was about to
be sent to Vegas.

544
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:39,218
Right, we're clear.
There's more.

545
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:40,970
I think that's it.
There's more.

546
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,306
There's a couple
stuck in there.

547
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,016
I'm telling you, they're out!
Come on.

548
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:48,561
Don't get so defensive,
it could be stuck in your hair.

549
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:50,438
Oh, there aren't?

550
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:52,189
What's that, huh?
What's that?

551
00:28:52,273 --> 00:28:54,442
There's no more. Thanks, hon.

552
00:28:54,609 --> 00:28:57,612
I couldn't wait to
get my hands on Vegas.

553
00:28:57,695 --> 00:29:00,406
But the bosses didn't send me there to have a good time.

554
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:03,576
They sent me to make sure
that nobody fucked with Ace

555
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,621
and nobody interfered
with the fucking skim.

556
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:09,123
Hey.

557
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,207
How you doing?

558
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,668
Hey, Sammy.

559
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:16,964
Boy, look at this place, huh?
All right. Incredible.

560
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:20,426
- Welcome to Vegas. Something, huh?
- Okay, Sammy. Yeah.

561
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:22,970
Ginger.

562
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:30,102
Holy shit.
What you been doing out here?

563
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:31,604
Honey, come here.

564
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:36,108
This is Jennifer and Nick,
dear friends of mine.

565
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:38,069
Hi, Jennifer.
A pleasure.

566
00:29:38,152 --> 00:29:39,820
Pleased to meet you.

567
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:41,822
Okay, Sammy.

568
00:29:42,323 --> 00:29:44,492
After we ate,
we left Jennifer and Ginger alone

569
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:46,744
and we took a ride
to talk.

570
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:49,330
And then he hit me with it.

571
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:52,333
What do you think
about me moving out here?

572
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:55,836
You got a problem with that?

573
00:29:56,003 --> 00:29:57,505
Of course not.

574
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,424
You mean,
I have your permission?

575
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:04,553
Sure, you have my permission but I gotta tell you,
it's no joke out here.

576
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:06,764
You gotta keep a low profile.

577
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,265
It's not like back home.

578
00:30:08,391 --> 00:30:09,767
They don't like guys like us.

579
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,769
And this
sheriff's a real cowboy.

580
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:14,522
Even the coppers
bury people out in the desert.

581
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:15,898
I don't care.

582
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:17,358
I wanna get away
from back home.

583
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,568
I'm tired of that
shit back there.

584
00:30:19,694 --> 00:30:21,529
Look at this place,
it's made of money.

585
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:23,322
You know the best part?

586
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,116
Nobody's gonna
know what we're doing.

587
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:27,618
There's nobody
here to see us.

588
00:30:27,702 --> 00:30:30,454
Nick, I got pinched
twice for no reason.

589
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:32,039
You really gotta be careful.

590
00:30:32,123 --> 00:30:34,750
I'm running a licensed place,
everything's legit.

591
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:36,043
Don't worry about it.

592
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,461
I'm not gonna do anything.

593
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:40,548
I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.

594
00:30:43,718 --> 00:30:45,469
Ace saw Vegas one way.

595
00:30:45,553 --> 00:30:46,554
You tell this guy I'm coming?

596
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:47,638
Course.

597
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:51,851
But I saw it another.
I saw it as untouched.

598
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:58,065
They had bookies, pimps,
and drug dealers I could shake down.

599
00:30:58,149 --> 00:30:59,984
Who the fuck were
they gonna run to?

600
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:01,944
So I started
getting everybody in line.

601
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:04,739
Best of all, for
the first time in my life,

602
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:07,241
I figured out
a way not to lose.

603
00:31:07,408 --> 00:31:09,368
Yeah,
he had a foolproof scheme.

604
00:31:09,493 --> 00:31:11,495
It wasn’t very
scientific but it worked.

605
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:13,456
When he won,
he collected, when he lost,

606
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:15,499
he told the bookies
to fuck themselves.

607
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,251
What were they
gonna do, muscle Nicky?

608
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:19,086
Nicky was the muscle.

609
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,254
Tony. How you doing?

610
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,464
Hey. How you doing?

611
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:22,965
Good.
You got that thing for me?

612
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,592
What thing?

613
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:26,844
Oh, Nicky,
I thought you was laying.

614
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:28,262
Iwas laying?
No, no, I'm taking.

615
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:29,764
I was taking.

616
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:31,891
You sure?
I'm positive.

617
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:34,310
I'm a little confused.

618
00:31:34,435 --> 00:31:36,020
You're a little confused?

619
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:38,147
Maybe if I stick
your fucking face

620
00:31:38,272 --> 00:31:40,357
through this window,
you'll get unconfused.

621
00:31:40,441 --> 00:31:41,776
Give me the money.

622
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:43,235
Sorry. I didn't mean
anything by it.

623
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:45,112
Yeah.
That's why you had it ready.

624
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,031
My fucking head.

625
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:48,866
Fucking head, huh?
Smarten up.

626
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:50,242
Don't fuck around, Tony.

627
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:53,871
Now Nicholas Santoro will tell us about our first President.

628
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:00,795
George Washington was born...

629
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:03,714
But still, it was nice
and quiet for a while.

630
00:32:03,798 --> 00:32:05,633
Ginger and I
presented Nicky and Jennifer

631
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:08,260
all over town like
regular Ozzie and Harriets.

632
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,347
Beautiful swing.

633
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:14,558
Ace got my son, little Nicky,
involved in Little League.

634
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,393
Turned out one of
the other coaches

635
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:18,229
was a fucking
Metro Intelligence cop.

636
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:20,815
But it didn't matter,
it was all about the kids.

637
00:32:21,023 --> 00:32:23,400
He's gotta realize everything can't be a home run.

638
00:32:23,484 --> 00:32:25,069
That's exactly
what I tell him.

639
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:26,821
But that's
the kind of kid he is.

640
00:32:29,073 --> 00:32:32,409
And Nicky, being Nicky,
he made his presence known.

641
00:32:32,827 --> 00:32:35,955
Especially at the casino,
where he definitely did not work,

642
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:37,581
people got the message.

643
00:32:37,665 --> 00:32:40,459
That’s why
the bosses sent me out here.

644
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:43,379
They wanted me to make sure
nobody robbed the joint.

645
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:45,798
Like these two
fucking balloon heads.

646
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:48,717
They were gonna try to bang us out of 200 fucking grand.

647
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:50,678
Yeah, right, I'm sure.

648
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:52,179
How are you?
What are you doing here?

649
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:53,722
I'm over here now.

650
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:55,141
Over here?

651
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:56,600
Yeah, with them.

652
00:33:01,355 --> 00:33:02,898
We're waiting on Carmine.

653
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:04,567
Yeah, we're looking
for Carmine.

654
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,318
He was here before.

655
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:08,154
He had a suitcase
and then he left.

656
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,363
Carmine left?

657
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:10,531
Carmine left?

658
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:14,118
He's gone?

659
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:16,203
He's not here?

660
00:33:19,874 --> 00:33:21,292
Carmine's out?

661
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:25,296
I think maybe he went across the street or somewhere.

662
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:31,135
Well, listen,
good luck with the joint.

663
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:32,219
Thanks, Eddy.

664
00:33:32,303 --> 00:33:33,304
Yeah. Lots of luck.

665
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:35,472
Good luck to you, too.

666
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:37,057
They forgot to
sign their papers.

667
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,394
Yeah, they don't
need those anymore.

668
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:44,190
Out of respect,
guys from other crews got a warning.

669
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:46,358
Everybody else, watch out.

670
00:33:47,902 --> 00:33:51,655
Like these yoke/s here,
who never heard of Nicky or the bosses,

671
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:54,283
'cause they're the morons who give you the most trouble.

672
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:55,618
Even after we catch them,

673
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:58,913
they try sneaking back with beards and wigs and fake noses.

674
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:03,751
You can spot these assholes
by watching the way they bet.

675
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:06,170
Like this guy,
he’s betting lavender chips

676
00:34:06,295 --> 00:34:08,672
at $500 each with
only one little problem,

677
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,799
he’s always guessed right.

678
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:15,471
If he wasn’t so
fucking greedy,

679
00:34:15,596 --> 00:34:17,348
he'd have been
tougher to spot.

680
00:34:17,431 --> 00:34:19,850
But in the end,
they're all greedy.

681
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:27,024
SINGING I got a feeling about the future

682
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:30,152
And it ain't too good,
I know that

683
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:39,912
I saw that the dealer was weak but he wasn’t in on it.

684
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:42,289
He just wasn’t
protecting his hand.

685
00:34:42,373 --> 00:34:45,125
He was lifting his
hole card way too high.

686
00:34:57,346 --> 00:35:00,557
Here '3 this guy
reading the dealer’s hole card

687
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:03,560
and signaling his
buddy at this table.

688
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:10,776
METALLIC CLICKING

689
00:35:11,819 --> 00:35:13,904
That’s just what
these hustlers look for.

690
00:35:13,988 --> 00:35:17,199
They cruise the casinos
looking for weak dealers

691
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:19,827
the way lions
look for weak antelope.

692
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:25,082
Operator, this is Mr. R.

693
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:27,835
Get me Armstrong and Friday
at Pit 2 right away.

694
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,771
BJ 19,
second base, the beard.

695
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:52,026
Operator, I need
Mr. Happy. Loud.

696
00:35:53,027 --> 00:35:56,864
SINGING
Happy birthday to you

697
00:35:57,323 --> 00:36:01,035
Happy birthday to you

698
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:05,873
Happy birthday, dear Jack

699
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,877
Happy birthday to you

700
00:36:27,186 --> 00:36:28,270
ZAPPING

701
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:29,396
EXCLAIMS

702
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,023
Man down!

703
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:33,650
Go get medical.

704
00:36:33,776 --> 00:36:35,235
We got a cardiac arrest here.

705
00:36:35,486 --> 00:36:37,029
He's fine, folks.

706
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:38,697
Just give us
some room, please.

707
00:36:40,324 --> 00:36:41,992
Watch yourselves.

708
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:45,454
They never know what hit them and if and when they do find out

709
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,664
that they got
zapped by a cattle prod,

710
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,958
they wish they really
did have a heart attack.

711
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:56,673
Turns out this
guy and his pals

712
00:36:56,799 --> 00:36:58,842
were knocking this
place dead for years.

713
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:00,844
He's got a wire.
What are you doing?

714
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,347
That's it.

715
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,349
Oh, God!

716
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:07,017
SAW WHIRRING

717
00:37:07,101 --> 00:37:10,062
HUSTLER

718
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:13,690
I wanted everybody to know that
things were changed around here.

719
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:18,570
We had to make an example of these pricks that the party was over.

720
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:22,658
I'm curious.
I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand.

721
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:24,118
Can you do that
with both hands?

722
00:37:26,036 --> 00:37:27,830
You can't?
No, sir.

723
00:37:28,831 --> 00:37:30,416
Can you do it
with your left hand?

724
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:32,126
I never tried.

725
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:33,627
So, you're a righty?

726
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,087
Yeah.

727
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:41,552
God!

728
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:46,932
Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.

729
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:48,809
It's $100,000,
$110,000, I think.

730
00:37:48,976 --> 00:37:50,352
Yes, it is. Yes.

731
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:51,645
Okay.

732
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:57,943
Hiya. That's a lot of money
to be counting out in public.

733
00:37:58,026 --> 00:37:59,153
Yeah.

734
00:37:59,403 --> 00:38:02,573
Why don't I take him to the office and verify it?

735
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,199
A little privacy.

736
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:07,578
And by the way,
send over a nice bottle of champagne.

737
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:09,204
Sure will.
Real special.

738
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:10,831
I'm Billy Sherbert,
casino manager.

739
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:14,251
Having a good time?
Yes.

740
00:38:14,334 --> 00:38:16,920
You'll want to count
the money in privacy...

741
00:38:17,004 --> 00:38:18,255
HUSTLER

742
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,673
Can I get my winnings?

743
00:38:22,176 --> 00:38:24,720
Look what they
did to my hand, man.

744
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:29,391
I'm gonna give you a choice.

745
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:32,269
You can have the money and the hammer,
or you can walk out of here.

746
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:33,479
You can't have both.

747
00:38:33,562 --> 00:38:35,439
What do you want?
I want out of here.

748
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:38,525
And tell your friends what happens if they fuck around here.

749
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,819
I'm sorry,
I made a bad mistake.

750
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,404
Fucking right, you did.

751
00:38:42,488 --> 00:38:44,448
Ifwe catch either
one of you again,

752
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:47,034
we'll break your heads and you won't walk out of here.

753
00:38:47,117 --> 00:38:50,954
You don't fuck around in this place,
you got it?

754
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:52,039
Get out of here.

755
00:38:52,206 --> 00:38:53,207
Thank you.

756
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:56,960
Throw him in the alley and tell the cops he got hit by a car.

757
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:57,127
In no time,
everything was set in place.

758
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:59,338
In no time,
everything was set in place.

759
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:02,633
We got rid of the freelance scamsters,
the pro was way up,

760
00:39:02,716 --> 00:39:05,969
the gods were happy,
as happy as they can ever be,

761
00:39:06,053 --> 00:39:08,472
and I decided to
complicate my life.

762
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:10,140
For a guy who
likes sure things,

763
00:39:10,224 --> 00:39:13,060
I was about to bet the rest of my life on a long shot.

764
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:14,895
We're not
getting any younger.

765
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,772
Don't you think it's time?

766
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,607
Aren't you getting
tired of all this shit?

767
00:39:18,732 --> 00:39:20,400
Hustling around?

768
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:22,319
Are you trying
to handicap me?

769
00:39:22,402 --> 00:39:24,571
I'm gonna do you one better.

770
00:39:24,905 --> 00:39:26,865
I'm trying to marry you.

771
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:29,451
You wanna marry me?

772
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:32,079
I'm serious.

773
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:36,792
I wanna settle down,
I want a family.

774
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,628
You got the wrong girl, Sam.

775
00:39:40,087 --> 00:39:42,172
I'd be a good father,
you'd be a good mother.

776
00:39:42,256 --> 00:39:44,841
You don't know me.
You've known me two, three months.

777
00:39:44,925 --> 00:39:46,385
What do you know?

778
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:48,929
I'm 43 years old.
I don't want to wait.

779
00:39:49,388 --> 00:39:50,764
I know you well
enough to know

780
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:52,766
that I really
love you very much.

781
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:56,228
And I can't think of anybody
better to be with

782
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:58,981
and I don't feel
like waiting anymore.

783
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:04,903
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam?
'Cause, I don't.

784
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:07,281
Yeah, I know all that.

785
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:08,448
SIGHS

786
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:13,120
I care about you,

787
00:40:13,954 --> 00:40:16,957
but I just don't have those kind of feelings for you.

788
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:21,837
I'm sorry.
I'm not in love with you.

789
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:26,883
Understand?

790
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:29,970
I'm sorry.

791
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,139
No, I...

792
00:40:35,142 --> 00:40:37,769
I mean, that can grow,

793
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:41,773
as long as there's a mutual respect,
that kind of thing can grow.

794
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:44,901
I'm realistic.
I can accept that.

795
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,738
What is love anyway?

796
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:50,157
It's a mutual respect,
it's a devotion,

797
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,160
it's a caring from
one person to another.

798
00:40:53,994 --> 00:40:57,456
And ifwe could set up
some kind of foundation

799
00:40:58,165 --> 00:41:00,167
based on that mutual respect,

800
00:41:01,168 --> 00:41:03,337
| feel eventually you would care enough about me

801
00:41:03,462 --> 00:41:05,631
that I could live with that.

802
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:12,679
If it doesn't work out, doesn't play out,
then what happens to me?

803
00:41:13,347 --> 00:41:16,391
You know, I'm doing well now,
and I'm gonna do even better,

804
00:41:16,475 --> 00:41:18,393
so whatever happens,

805
00:41:18,894 --> 00:41:20,646
if it doesn't
work out between us,

806
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:23,440
I'll make sure you're okay
for the rest of your life.

807
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:25,901
And if there are kids,
especially,

808
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:28,028
I'll take care of
you better than...

809
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:29,529
What are you pitching me?

810
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:31,031
Just what I said.

811
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:36,328
You'll be set up for the rest of your life,
that I can promise you.

812
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:42,793
Wanna take a chance?

813
00:41:47,381 --> 00:41:48,382
CLINKING GLASSES

APPLAUSE

815
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:55,305
When I married Ginger,
I knew all the stories.

816
00:41:55,389 --> 00:41:59,893
But I didn't give a fuck. I’m Sam Rothstein,"
I said, "I can change her."

817
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:03,605
It was typical Ace.

818
00:42:03,689 --> 00:42:06,942
He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show

819
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:09,319
'cause they all
wanted something from him.

820
00:42:09,403 --> 00:42:12,823
With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride,
even Ginger.

821
00:42:12,906 --> 00:42:14,700
With her,
he still covered his bets.

822
00:42:14,783 --> 00:42:17,911
They had to have the baby before they could get married.

823
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:20,664
He even made Jenny and me
watch Amy for a few days

824
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:22,290
when they went on
their honeymoon,

825
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:24,042
but I didn't mind,
we loved the kid.

826
00:42:28,714 --> 00:42:30,882
Can you feel my eyes on you?

827
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:33,927
Can you feel me
look into your heart?

828
00:42:34,928 --> 00:42:37,639
Can you feel me in
the pit of your stomach?

829
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:42,436
Can you feel me in you?

830
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:45,731
In your heart?

831
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:50,235
Don't make me come there.

832
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,237
Answer me.

833
00:42:52,946 --> 00:42:54,114
CRY/NG I love you.

834
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:56,199
But, baby, do you know
that I love you, too?

835
00:42:56,283 --> 00:42:57,659
I know, Lester.

836
00:42:57,743 --> 00:42:59,745
Do you know that?
- Yeah.

837
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:03,373
This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.

838
00:43:03,457 --> 00:43:06,042
That's right.
So it's going to be okay.

839
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:07,586
Promise?

840
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:10,964
God. | Wish you all
the luck in the world.

841
00:43:11,465 --> 00:43:12,591
You do?

842
00:43:12,716 --> 00:43:13,842
Yeah, I do.

843
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:17,012
It's the best thing
you can do right now.

844
00:43:17,596 --> 00:43:20,891
I mean this.
You'll have real security.

845
00:43:21,308 --> 00:43:25,562
Sweetheart, you're gonna be situated just right in Vegas.

846
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:27,522
Come on,
this is great for us.

847
00:43:27,856 --> 00:43:29,483
I'm always gonna
be here for you.

848
00:43:29,649 --> 00:43:31,276
I ain't going no place.

849
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:35,030
I'm looking at you right now.

850
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:39,201
I'm seeing you for the very first time,
right this minute.

851
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:42,078
I'm seeing you.
I can feel my heart click.

852
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:46,500
Isee you 14 years old,
I see you the first second I ever saw you.

853
00:43:47,626 --> 00:43:51,671
I see you long-legged little colt,
stupid braces on your teeth.

854
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:53,882
Okay, then.

855
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:55,675
Every time I see you,
that’s what I see.

856
00:43:56,218 --> 00:43:57,886
Talk to you later.

857
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:06,686
You all right?

858
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:07,771
Yeah.

859
00:44:09,606 --> 00:44:11,316
Why are you crying?

860
00:44:13,485 --> 00:44:14,611
I'm not crying.

861
00:44:14,778 --> 00:44:15,779
GINGER SNIFFLES

862
00:44:20,242 --> 00:44:22,619
Maybe you
shouldn't drink so much.

863
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:24,454
I'm okay, Ijust...

864
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:30,418
You just have to understand.

865
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:33,547
I've been with Lester
since I was a kid.

866
00:44:35,966 --> 00:44:38,009
| Just wanted to say goodbye.

867
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:41,179
Ijust... Idon't...

868
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:45,392
I think I have
a right to do that.

869
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:49,604
Okay?

870
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:50,897
It's all right.

871
00:44:52,566 --> 00:44:55,068
But that part of
your life is over with.

872
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:57,153
Yeah.
Right?

873
00:44:58,071 --> 00:44:59,823
You're with me now.

874
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,325
Yeah.
Right?

875
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:03,410
Uh-huh.

876
00:45:05,704 --> 00:45:06,872
You're sure?

877
00:45:06,997 --> 00:45:08,164
Yeah.

878
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,086
Yeah.

879
00:45:15,297 --> 00:45:16,840
You wanna go?
Let's go back in.

880
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:18,508
Okay.

881
00:45:32,606 --> 00:45:34,608
WHATA DIFFERENCE
A DAY MADE PLAYING

882
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:38,820
SINGING
What a difference a day made

883
00:45:38,904 --> 00:45:40,280
It's great.

884
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:45,243
SINGING
Twenty-four little hours

885
00:45:45,327 --> 00:45:46,578
It's great.

886
00:45:49,122 --> 00:45:50,123
GINGER EXCLAIMS IN DELIGHT

887
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:53,793
It's all my stuff.
Oh, my God.

888
00:45:54,586 --> 00:45:56,546
You brought all my stuff!

889
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:57,964
I can't...

890
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:01,343
Try it on, it's yours.

891
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:03,511
You're kidding.

892
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,556
Oh, my God.

893
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:08,600
What is it?

894
00:46:08,725 --> 00:46:09,768
It's chinchilla.

895
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:12,312
Oh, it's so soft.

896
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:14,439
It's nice, isn't it?

897
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:15,607
Oh.

898
00:46:19,819 --> 00:46:22,155
No one's ever
been so nice to me.

899
00:46:29,663 --> 00:46:30,664
GASPS

900
00:46:31,331 --> 00:46:32,540
EXCLAIMING

901
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:35,377
Oh, my God!

902
00:46:37,504 --> 00:46:40,757
Do you think it's too much if I wear these all on the same day?

903
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,842
You do whatever you want.

904
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:45,637
Do I keep my promises
or do I keep my promises?

905
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,972
It's so wonderful.

906
00:46:47,097 --> 00:46:48,348
The jewelry's
not so bad either.

907
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:49,808
The only thing is,

908
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:52,477
we shouldn't keep this in the house,
we gotta put it in the bank.

909
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,397
Come on, can I keep
this one in the house?

910
00:46:55,522 --> 00:46:57,232
Pay attention to me.

911
00:46:58,525 --> 00:46:59,943
What I'm gonna tell
you is very important.

912
00:47:00,068 --> 00:47:01,528
Okay.

913
00:47:01,611 --> 00:47:03,613
All this stuff
doesn't mean anything.

914
00:47:03,697 --> 00:47:06,408
Money, this,
doesn't mean anything without trust.

915
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:08,868
I have to be able to
trust you with my life.

916
00:47:09,202 --> 00:47:12,247
SINGING
It's heaven when you

917
00:47:15,333 --> 00:47:19,462
Find romance on your menu

918
00:47:19,546 --> 00:47:21,840
With over
$1 million in cash and jewels

919
00:47:21,965 --> 00:47:24,300
tucked in a bank in Vegas,
only for Ginger,

920
00:47:24,384 --> 00:47:27,387
she was secure and happy,
she loved that shit.

921
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:31,641
But a guy in my line of work has to have a lot of payoff cash around.

922
00:47:31,725 --> 00:47:34,436
Crooked cops and kidnappers
don't take checks.

923
00:47:34,853 --> 00:47:36,813
Need a little help
with that, Mr. Collins?

924
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:39,816
So I put $2 million in
cash in a Los Angeles bank

925
00:47:39,899 --> 00:47:42,819
under the name of Mr.
And Mrs. Tom Collins.

926
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:46,197
This was strictly my shakedown and kidnapping money.

927
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:53,163
And since I 'd either be in jail or locked in a closet

928
00:47:53,246 --> 00:47:54,664
when I needed
the money the most,

929
00:47:54,748 --> 00:47:58,710
I gave Ginger the only key to the cash that could get me back alive.

930
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:00,211
I'LL TAKE YOU THERE PLAYING

931
00:48:00,295 --> 00:48:01,504
SINGING
I'll take you there

932
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:02,839
I'm cal/in', callin'

933
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:04,924
Callin' for mercy

934
00:48:05,008 --> 00:48:06,885
I'll take you there

935
00:48:06,968 --> 00:48:09,637
Mercy, mercy

936
00:48:09,721 --> 00:48:11,723
I'll take you there

937
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:14,059
This is a signature card.

938
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:17,687
Once she signs
those papers,

939
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:19,814
she'll be the only person
with access to the box,

940
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:21,691
no one else,
including myself?

941
00:48:21,775 --> 00:48:24,611
That's right,
that's the way you wanted it.

942
00:48:25,028 --> 00:48:27,280
Sam,
let me ask you a question.

943
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:29,532
You must really
trust your wife.

944
00:48:32,744 --> 00:48:34,162
Yeah, sure I do. Why?

945
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:37,624
No, it's good.
It's just unusual.

946
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:39,959
To tell you the truth,
so many of my clients don't.

947
00:48:45,799 --> 00:48:46,883
Okay.

948
00:48:50,637 --> 00:48:56,101
Never will I know happiness

949
00:48:56,226 --> 00:48:58,978
With Ginger and the money in place,
I felt covered.

950
00:48:59,062 --> 00:49:01,564
And to play it safe,
I switched job titles again

951
00:49:01,648 --> 00:49:04,818
and made myself
Food and Beverage Director.

952
00:49:05,068 --> 00:49:07,570
This way,
nobody would bother me about a license.

953
00:49:07,654 --> 00:49:09,656
Imean, Vegas was
like a dream for me.

954
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:12,659
Trouble was,
Nicky was dreaming his own kind of Vegas.

955
00:49:12,742 --> 00:49:14,619
I put money out
on the street,

956
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:17,539
charging three points a week,
juice to the dealers.

957
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:19,082
Don't make us
come looking for you.

958
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:21,501
You won't have to.
Thanks, Nicky.

959
00:49:23,002 --> 00:49:25,588
They were degenerate gamblers,
coke freaks.

960
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:29,425
In no time,
I had half the dealers in the Tangiers in my pocket.

961
00:49:29,509 --> 00:49:33,847
The next thing I did,
I started busting out high-stakes poker players.

962
00:49:34,055 --> 00:49:38,768
It was so obvious.
All of Nicky’s half-assed mechanics were signal-happy.

963
00:49:38,852 --> 00:49:40,770
I'm gonna open for $500.

964
00:49:40,854 --> 00:49:42,647
Signaling back and forth.

965
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:46,192
GAMBLER

966
00:49:46,276 --> 00:49:47,694
Nicky thought
nobody was watching him.

967
00:49:47,861 --> 00:49:49,320
He was wrong.

968
00:49:49,404 --> 00:49:52,073
And I didn't want any ofthose agents near my place.

969
00:49:52,157 --> 00:49:53,950
Four aces.

970
00:49:54,075 --> 00:49:55,869
I can't believe this.

971
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:59,247
GAMBLER

972
00:50:00,832 --> 00:50:03,626
I wished Nicky and
his crew would just get lost.

973
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:04,878
What am I gonna do?

974
00:50:05,003 --> 00:50:06,129
Go back home and start a war?

975
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:07,380
Nicky’s a made guy
and I'm not.

976
00:50:07,505 --> 00:50:08,631
I can't do that.

977
00:50:08,715 --> 00:50:11,050
Careful. Gaming agents
are all over the place.

978
00:50:11,134 --> 00:50:13,511
So I'm not allowed
to get lucky in this place?

979
00:50:13,595 --> 00:50:15,263
You've been lucky all week.

980
00:50:15,388 --> 00:50:17,056
They're looking
to nail you.

981
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:20,852
Ace was so fucking
worried about his casino,

982
00:50:20,977 --> 00:50:23,396
he forgot
what we were doing here.

983
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:25,899
A million times
I wanted to yell

984
00:50:26,024 --> 00:50:28,109
in his fucking ear,
"This is Las Vegas.

985
00:50:28,193 --> 00:50:32,030
"We’re supposed to be out here robbing,
you dumb fucking hebe."

986
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:38,953
I don't give a shit
who he's connected to,

987
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:40,830
tell him to take his
feet off the table.

988
00:50:40,914 --> 00:50:43,166
What does he think this is,
a goddamn sawdustjoint?

989
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,421
Sir, would you mind taking
your feet off the table?

990
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:51,883
Yeah, Iwould mind.
I'm having a bad night.

991
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:55,553
Fucking asshole won't budge.

992
00:50:56,304 --> 00:50:57,805
Call security.

993
00:51:01,184 --> 00:51:02,769
How are you?

994
00:51:02,894 --> 00:51:04,437
Good. How are you?

995
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,730
Wanna do me a favor?

996
00:51:05,813 --> 00:51:07,565
Take your feet off the table and put your shoes on.

997
00:51:08,191 --> 00:51:09,442
Fuck you.

998
00:51:12,946 --> 00:51:14,739
I want you to exit
this guy off the premises

999
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:18,493
and use his head to
open the fucking door.

1000
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:20,453
Sir, you're gonna
havetoleave.

1001
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:22,497
You mind
accompanying us outside?

1002
00:51:22,956 --> 00:51:24,415
Bullshit. I ain't
going anywhere with you.

1003
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:25,500
Bullshit, you're out of here.

1004
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:26,626
Fuck you!

1005
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:28,378
You know who you're
fucking with, huh?

1006
00:51:28,503 --> 00:51:30,213
Do you?

1007
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:31,923
You fucking faggot.

1008
00:51:32,048 --> 00:51:33,675
Do you know who
you're fucking with?

1009
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,093
Leave me alone!

1010
00:51:35,218 --> 00:51:36,511
Here we go.

1011
00:51:36,594 --> 00:51:38,888
You gotta be kidding me!

1012
00:51:39,055 --> 00:51:41,432
And an hour later,
I get the call.

1013
00:51:41,516 --> 00:51:43,476
Ace, what happened?

1014
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:45,561
Did you know that
guy was with me?

1015
00:51:45,645 --> 00:51:47,814
No, Ididn't.
But you know what he did?

1016
00:51:48,398 --> 00:51:51,192
I walked over to him politely and he tells me to go fuck myself.

1017
00:51:51,276 --> 00:51:52,277
Then he called me a faggot.

1018
00:51:52,402 --> 00:51:53,403
What?

1019
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:54,654
I threw the cocksucker out.

1020
00:51:54,821 --> 00:51:56,030
Come here.

1021
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:58,074
You called my friend a faggot?

1022
00:51:58,199 --> 00:52:00,159
You tell him to fuck himself?
Is that what you did?

1023
00:52:00,952 --> 00:52:03,871
You fucking hick.
You fucking hick, you.

1024
00:52:03,955 --> 00:52:04,998
Come here.

1025
00:52:05,665 --> 00:52:07,125
Come here.

1026
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:08,960
You go over there
and you apologize.

1027
00:52:09,085 --> 00:52:10,837
You better hope
he lets you back in.

1028
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,257
Ifyou get out ofline again,
I'll smash your head so hard

1029
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,342
you won't be able to
get that cowboy hat on,

1030
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:18,428
you hear me?
You fucking hick.

1031
00:52:18,511 --> 00:52:22,473
Sammy, listen,
this guy obviously doesn't know who he was talking to.

1032
00:52:22,557 --> 00:52:25,184
He doesn't know that
we're dear friends.

1033
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:27,103
I mean,
he's already very sorry.

1034
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:30,231
But ifyou could do me a favor and let him back in,

1035
00:52:30,315 --> 00:52:32,734
I swear he'll never
get out of line again.

1036
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:34,944
If he does it again,
he's out for good.

1037
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:37,238
I'll never let him
in the place again.

1038
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:38,531
I 'm sorry about this, really.

1039
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:40,575
All right, Ace?

1040
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:42,744
Thanks, paL

1041
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:45,038
You took your boots off?

1042
00:52:45,204 --> 00:52:46,873
You put your
feet on the table?

1043
00:52:46,956 --> 00:52:51,294
You shit-kicking, stinky,
horse-manure-smelling motherfucker, you!

1044
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:55,506
You fuck me up over there,
I'll stick you in the desert. Go apologize.

1045
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:57,091
- Get the fuck...
- I'm sorry.

1046
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:03,598
You know, Ace could
be a very touchy guy.

1047
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:05,933
Especially when
he got bigger in town.

1048
00:53:06,017 --> 00:53:09,270
Like when he hired that Jonathan and David away from the Palace

1049
00:53:09,354 --> 00:53:12,982
by building them a new stage and giving them a silver Rolls-Royce.

1050
00:53:13,066 --> 00:53:15,276
But he knew how to
bring in the crowds.

1051
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:17,653
Knew all the fucking angles.

1052
00:53:17,904 --> 00:53:20,656
He brought over the whole
Femme Fatale show from Paris.

1053
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:23,743
But he forgot how lazy
them European broads can get.

1054
00:53:23,993 --> 00:53:25,578
He weighed them
once a week

1055
00:53:25,661 --> 00:53:27,747
to make sure they didn't
blow up like balloons.

1056
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:29,707
You're eight pounds over.

1057
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:31,250
What's the reason for this?

1058
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:33,252
Mr. Rothstein, sir...

1059
00:53:33,378 --> 00:53:35,296
Never mind the "sir."

1060
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:36,756
Why is she eight pounds over?

1061
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:38,216
I'm trying to offer
you the respect...

1062
00:53:38,299 --> 00:53:40,510
Mr. Rothstein is
good enough for you.

1063
00:53:40,593 --> 00:53:44,263
Sometimes when you put that pressure point on them...

1064
00:53:44,347 --> 00:53:46,057
All you do is
give me answers.

1065
00:53:46,182 --> 00:53:47,850
Just give me
the right answer.

1066
00:53:47,934 --> 00:53:51,854
I guess she's frightened if she doesn't lose weight,
she may get fired.

1067
00:53:51,938 --> 00:53:53,314
That's right,
she will get fired.

1068
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:54,816
Send her back to Paris.

1069
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:56,484
Just stop everything.

1070
00:53:56,609 --> 00:53:58,277
This woman's an institution...

1071
00:53:59,112 --> 00:54:00,279
She's lazy.

1072
00:54:00,363 --> 00:54:02,281
I gotta give the guy credit.

1073
00:54:02,365 --> 00:54:04,534
Imean, he does
the most obvious thing.

1074
00:54:04,617 --> 00:54:06,160
This is the only
town in the country

1075
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:07,870
where a bookie
joint is legit.

1076
00:54:07,954 --> 00:54:10,039
So why not take advantage,
right?

1077
00:54:10,123 --> 00:54:12,417
So he took bookie
joints off the street

1078
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:14,836
and opened them up
inside the casino.

1079
00:54:14,919 --> 00:54:17,380
Within a few years,
he had every casino

1080
00:54:17,505 --> 00:54:19,966
on The Strip trying
to copy off of him.

1081
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:22,468
Between my innovations

1082
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:28,057
and Nicky’s
dedication to his job,

1083
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:33,396
I soon had the best
operation on The Strip.

1084
00:54:36,983 --> 00:54:39,819
Be careful,
there's a lot of heat on you already.

1085
00:54:40,653 --> 00:54:41,988
Why? Somebody's complaining?

1086
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:44,532
I'm hearing
things from security.

1087
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:47,577
The sheriff's looking to put you in the Black Book.

1088
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,704
That Black Book is
a bunch of bullshit.

1089
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:51,622
They got two names
for the whole country

1090
00:54:51,747 --> 00:54:53,583
and one of them
is still Al Capone.

1091
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:56,419
If they put you in that book,
you're gonna be in trouble.

1092
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:58,880
You will not be able
to walk into a casino.

1093
00:54:59,672 --> 00:55:02,216
I'm trying to make a living,
that's all.

1094
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,594
I'm just telling you,
don't say I didn't warn you.

1095
00:55:04,677 --> 00:55:06,053
All right.

1096
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:13,019
Mrs.
Rothstein, straight ahead.

1097
00:55:13,144 --> 00:55:14,770
Very nice. Thank you.

1098
00:55:14,854 --> 00:55:15,855
Smile...

1099
00:55:16,022 --> 00:55:17,064
Just look...

1100
00:55:19,734 --> 00:55:22,111
For his hard work
and dedication

1101
00:55:22,195 --> 00:55:24,989
and the new life-blood
he has instilled in Las Vegas,

1102
00:55:25,072 --> 00:55:26,657
Sam has established himself

1103
00:55:26,741 --> 00:55:30,036
as an indispensable member
of the gaming community.

1104
00:55:30,536 --> 00:55:33,039
As the head of the Tangiers Gaming Corporation,

1105
00:55:33,122 --> 00:55:35,333
it's my pleasure to
welcome Sam Rothstein

1106
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:37,668
to the Vegas
Valley Country Club.

1107
00:55:39,295 --> 00:55:41,088
APPLAUSE

1108
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:47,512
Back home,
they'd have put me in jail for what I 'm doing

1109
00:55:47,595 --> 00:55:49,805
but out here,
they're giving me awards.

1110
00:55:49,889 --> 00:55:54,227
It is with great pleasure that I accept this certificate of appreciation

1111
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:57,480
from the Charitable Foundations of Greater Las Vegas.

1112
00:55:58,105 --> 00:55:59,649
Congratulations, sweetheart.

1113
00:55:59,732 --> 00:56:02,735
Sam raised more than we've ever raised before.

1114
00:56:03,903 --> 00:56:05,905
But my greatest
pleasure was watching

1115
00:56:06,072 --> 00:56:08,115
my wife,
Ginger, work the room.

1116
00:56:08,741 --> 00:56:10,117
They all loved her.

1117
00:56:10,243 --> 00:56:11,619
How could you not love her?

1118
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:14,038
She could be the most charming woman you ever saw.

1119
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:15,790
People loved to
be around her.

1120
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:19,085
You've got to bring Amy
to Sasha's birthday party.

1121
00:56:19,919 --> 00:56:21,420
See you 3:00,
Saturday.

1122
00:56:21,546 --> 00:56:23,089
Yes, all right.

1123
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,967
She made everybody feel good.

1124
00:56:31,764 --> 00:56:33,516
Congratulations, Sam.

1125
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:34,809
Thanks.

1126
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:36,852
Hello, Mrs. Rothstein.
How are you?

1127
00:56:36,978 --> 00:56:38,437
Hi. Oh.

1128
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:41,816
You're the most gorgeous woman
I've ever seen.

1129
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:44,026
You're a lucky man,
Mr. Rothstein.

1130
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:49,615
Thank you.
Thanks for that compliment.

1131
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:52,326
He was a young
kid from the casino.

1132
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:54,203
Nice kid. Bright boy.

1133
00:56:54,537 --> 00:56:56,038
What balls on
this fucking kid.

1134
00:56:56,122 --> 00:56:57,623
The next day I fired him.

1135
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:00,793
Ginger had that
effect on people.

1136
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,712
I think she even
encouraged them.

1137
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:04,839
Do you wanna see this one?

1138
00:57:05,715 --> 00:57:06,716
GINGER EXCLAIMS

1139
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:10,553
Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.

1140
00:57:10,845 --> 00:57:12,263
But as much as
they loved her...

1141
00:57:12,346 --> 00:57:13,764
Fabulous!

1142
00:57:13,848 --> 00:57:15,641
...they didn't know
what really moved her.

1143
00:57:15,725 --> 00:57:19,562
Look at this.
Daddy gave me this...

1144
00:57:19,645 --> 00:57:21,814
And with Ginger happy,
I was able

1145
00:57:21,981 --> 00:57:24,150
to concentrate on
what I knew best.

1146
00:57:24,317 --> 00:57:26,819
Loose machines are
right back over there.

1147
00:57:27,153 --> 00:57:29,363
What are they
doing back there?

1148
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:31,365
Okay.
You can't even see them there.

1149
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:33,492
What about the progressives
with the high jackpots?

1150
00:57:33,576 --> 00:57:35,328
Where are they?
These machines are hidden.

1151
00:57:35,411 --> 00:57:36,454
These are our best machines.

1152
00:57:36,579 --> 00:57:37,580
They bring all the action.

1153
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:39,040
No wonder the drop is off.

1154
00:57:39,123 --> 00:57:40,750
The action is in the front,
not the back.

1155
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:42,752
Bring them up front.
All right, IwiII.

1156
00:57:42,835 --> 00:57:46,255
Listen carefully,
there are three ways of doing things here,

1157
00:57:46,339 --> 00:57:49,342
the right way, the wrong way
and the way that I do it.

1158
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,177
You understand?

1159
00:57:51,344 --> 00:57:52,720
I do, I'll get right on it.

1160
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:54,138
And thank you.

1161
00:57:54,263 --> 00:57:55,598
Don't thank me,
just do it.

1162
00:57:55,681 --> 00:57:58,017
You're the slots manager.
I shouldn't have to tell you this.

1163
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:00,853
Dang, you are right,
Mr. Rothstein.

1164
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:02,480
I am so sorry.

1165
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:06,609
So I ended up working,
what, 18-hour days.

1166
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:09,445
Ginger was the one who wound up enjoying the best of Vegas.

1167
00:58:09,528 --> 00:58:12,948
Come with me, please.
I have a better table for you. Sorry.

1168
00:58:13,032 --> 00:58:15,242
What did you say to
that fucking jerk?

1169
00:58:15,326 --> 00:58:17,828
I told him Iwas
Mrs. Sam Rothstein.

1170
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:22,166
Well, you might as well
get something out of it.

1171
00:58:24,794 --> 00:58:28,631
Well,
it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened.

1172
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:30,091
Nicky managed to
get himself banned

1173
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:32,426
from every
casino in Las Vegas.

1174
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,261
From then on,
I couldn't be seen talking

1175
00:58:34,345 --> 00:58:36,639
to him anywhere
in or near Vegas.

1176
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:38,557
What the fuck is
that supposed to mean?

1177
00:58:38,641 --> 00:58:43,896
"...detrimental to gaming and he will be
ejected from any casino in Las Vegas.

1178
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:48,484
"And the casinos can be fined
as much as $100,000

1179
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:50,361
"every time he shows up."

1180
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:52,071
You believe this shit?

1181
00:58:52,196 --> 00:58:53,823
Yeah, I believe it.
You got banned.

1182
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:57,368
"Because of notorious
and unsavory reputation."

1183
00:58:57,451 --> 00:58:59,245
Motherfucker!

1184
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,165
Is there any way around this?

1185
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:04,917
No, there's no way.

1186
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:08,754
Let's say, for instance,

1187
00:59:09,004 --> 00:59:12,675
I wanna go in a restaurant,
which happens to be in a casino,

1188
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:14,510
to get one of those
sandwiches I like?

1189
00:59:14,593 --> 00:59:17,722
Forget it. You can't even set
foot in the parking lot.

1190
00:59:18,431 --> 00:59:20,224
That's how serious it is.

1191
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:25,104
In other words, I'm fucked?

1192
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:26,856
In so many words, yes.

1193
00:59:26,939 --> 00:59:28,566
It just didn't
sink into his head

1194
00:59:28,691 --> 00:59:30,317
about the Black
Book and what it meant.

1195
00:59:30,401 --> 00:59:33,404
Not being able to go into a casino is one thing,

1196
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:35,823
but being in this
book etched your name

1197
00:59:35,948 --> 00:59:38,325
into the brains of
every cop and FBI agent.

1198
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:40,077
You're listed in
there with Al Capone.

1199
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:41,871
But Nicky didn ’1‘ care.

1200
00:59:41,954 --> 00:59:43,748
I gotta do something.
I gotta do something.

1201
00:59:43,873 --> 00:59:45,666
They ain't getting rid of me.

1202
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,001
They're not
getting rid of me.

1203
00:59:47,126 --> 00:59:48,419
I'm staying here.

1204
00:59:48,502 --> 00:59:51,213
Fuck them. Fuck them.

1205
00:59:55,676 --> 00:59:58,137
So,
once they pulled that shit,

1206
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:01,599
I started doing my own things
nobody ever thought of doing.

1207
01:00:01,682 --> 01:00:04,727
To keep an eye on things,
I brought in my brother, Dominick,

1208
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:06,729
and some desperados

1209
01:00:06,812 --> 01:00:10,441
and started knocking over high-rollers,
casino bosses, bookmakers.

1210
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:12,443
Anybody right here in town.

1211
01:00:12,568 --> 01:00:14,487
I had a good
fucking crew going for me.

1212
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:18,866
I had Sal Fusco,
a great second-story guy.

1213
01:00:19,325 --> 01:00:23,662
Jack Hardy.
He worked for a safe company before he did a six-year bit.

1214
01:00:24,038 --> 01:00:26,123
And then there
was Bernie Blue.

1215
01:00:26,248 --> 01:00:28,334
This guy could
bypass any alarm for me.

1216
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:31,170
It was like old times.

1217
01:00:31,587 --> 01:00:35,508
And I opened up my own jewelry store too,
The Gold Rush.

1218
01:00:35,591 --> 01:00:39,053
Sometimes I used to go along on a heist,
just for the fun of it

1219
01:00:39,386 --> 01:00:41,764
but I didn't like the people I was ripping off looking at me

1220
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:44,600
so I used to turn their fucking pictures around.

1221
01:00:45,184 --> 01:00:46,685
What's taking so long?

1222
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:48,354
This is
a motherfucker.

1223
01:00:49,188 --> 01:00:52,149
Learn how to open the things so you don't have to take them.

1224
01:00:52,233 --> 01:00:54,276
Some of these stones
got a lot of niggers in them.

1225
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:56,654
Tell Pepe if he's
switching stones on us

1226
01:00:56,737 --> 01:00:58,656
he better take
a camel back to Nigeria.

1227
01:00:58,739 --> 01:00:59,740
TELEPHONE RINGS

1228
01:01:00,866 --> 01:01:01,826
Yeah?

1229
01:01:01,951 --> 01:01:03,786
They're in Penthouse K.
Checked in alone?

1230
01:01:03,911 --> 01:01:05,830
Yes.
Are they out now?

1231
01:01:05,955 --> 01:01:06,956
Yes. Don't worry.

1232
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:08,123
Thanks.

1233
01:01:08,207 --> 01:01:10,626
He had tipsters all over town.
Bel/men.

1234
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:12,211
This looks good
but you got to hurry.

1235
01:01:12,378 --> 01:01:13,879
Yeah, okay.

1236
01:01:13,963 --> 01:01:15,130
Valet parkers.

1237
01:01:15,256 --> 01:01:16,423
They're checking in.

1238
01:01:16,507 --> 01:01:18,092
Okay, I'll tell him.
- Pit bosses.

1239
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:19,718
Room 1230 at The Sirocco.

1240
01:01:19,844 --> 01:01:21,387
1230.

1241
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:22,721
Secretaries.

1242
01:01:22,847 --> 01:01:24,056
Mint condition coins.

1243
01:01:24,139 --> 01:01:25,558
Mint condition.

1244
01:01:25,683 --> 01:01:27,101
They all got
a piece of the score.

1245
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:28,394
Car's coming.

1246
01:01:33,315 --> 01:01:35,067
They were very careful.

1247
01:01:35,234 --> 01:01:37,736
They always bypassed
the alarms, or else,

1248
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:39,697
if not, they’d drill
enough holes

1249
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:41,907
to knock through the walls
with a Sledgehammer.

1250
01:01:43,868 --> 01:01:46,620
Nicky was grabbing
everything he could.

1251
01:01:46,704 --> 01:01:49,582
Nobody out there
was expecting a guy like him.

1252
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:53,586
To Nicky,
Las Vegas was the fucking Wild West.

1253
01:01:53,669 --> 01:01:55,838
Ijust got a shipment
of diamonds from Israel.

1254
01:01:55,921 --> 01:01:57,590
What the fuck
they expect from me?

1255
01:01:57,715 --> 01:01:59,383
I had to earn, didn't I?

1256
01:02:00,092 --> 01:02:02,261
You know,
this diamond has flaws in it.

1257
01:02:02,344 --> 01:02:04,263
There's no flaws.

1258
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:06,307
I'm doing this for 25 years.

1259
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:10,144
You better clean your Ioupe
because there's no flaws.

1260
01:02:10,269 --> 01:02:11,687
Whenever we got
local merch,

1261
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:15,274
we 'd usually send it to
Palm Springs or Arizona, L.A.

1262
01:02:15,357 --> 01:02:16,609
I had some
sand niggers out there.

1263
01:02:16,775 --> 01:02:18,027
You know, Arabs.

1264
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:20,696
Are you gonna have
a fucking meeting here?

1265
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:22,907
I know his language.

1266
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:24,825
$40,000. The whole package.

1267
01:02:24,909 --> 01:02:27,328
$20,000.
That's my final offer.

1268
01:02:27,411 --> 01:02:29,288
He suddenly talks English.

1269
01:02:29,413 --> 01:02:31,290
Let's talk turkey here.
$25,000.

1270
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:34,084
I actually
turned my bedroom

1271
01:02:34,168 --> 01:02:36,211
into a bank vault
where I kept the choice stuff.

1272
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:40,883
I couldn't leave it
at The Gold Rush

1273
01:02:41,008 --> 01:02:42,676
in case we got
raided by the cops

1274
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,845
or if my crew got cute.

1275
01:02:45,137 --> 01:02:46,138
I had the only key.

1276
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:47,222
Jennifer didn't give a fuck.

1277
01:02:47,306 --> 01:02:50,517
She used to fall asleep on the couch watching TV every night.

1278
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:52,353
This stuff was all mine.

1279
01:02:52,478 --> 01:02:54,271
I didn't send any
of this back home.

1280
01:02:54,355 --> 01:02:57,524
I couldn't because I wasn’t even supposed to be doing it.

1281
01:02:57,608 --> 01:03:00,319
The bosses were making so much money with the casinos

1282
01:03:00,402 --> 01:03:03,530
that they didn't want anybody
making any waves for them.

1283
01:03:05,157 --> 01:03:06,825
You gave all
the guys a piece of that?

1284
01:03:06,909 --> 01:03:07,826
I took care of everyone.

1285
01:03:07,952 --> 01:03:08,827
Yeah?

1286
01:03:08,911 --> 01:03:10,871
That’s why there
was no organized street stuff

1287
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:12,498
in Vegas before I came here.

1288
01:03:14,333 --> 01:03:16,752
But how much cash
could I bury in my closet?

1289
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:18,671
...understand,
and I'm sure you do,

1290
01:03:18,754 --> 01:03:20,881
in a venture of this kind

1291
01:03:21,006 --> 01:03:23,175
you have to be prepared to
take some kind of loss.

1292
01:03:23,592 --> 01:03:25,552
I put some of the money into legitimate deals

1293
01:03:25,636 --> 01:03:27,972
with Charlie Clark,
Ace's banker.

1294
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:31,016
You will try to push it through,
Mr. Clark? Yes.

1295
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:33,185
I'm giving you $50,000 cash.

1296
01:03:33,268 --> 01:03:37,106
Then I put some more money into legitimate places,
like my restaurant.

1297
01:03:37,189 --> 01:03:38,774
- Is that the last?
- Yeah.

1298
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:41,527
I had my kid brother, Dominick,
run it for me.

1299
01:03:43,237 --> 01:03:44,822
Fuckers.

1300
01:03:49,702 --> 01:03:52,538
Here you go, guys.
All right. Thanks a lot.

1301
01:03:52,663 --> 01:03:53,789
Enjoy. Have a good time.

1302
01:03:53,872 --> 01:03:55,332
Hey.
Choke on it, motherfucker.

1303
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:56,917
How you doing?

1304
01:03:57,001 --> 01:03:58,919
Yeah,
Nicky loved restaurants.

1305
01:03:59,044 --> 01:04:00,963
He was a real
restaurant buff.

1306
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:03,632
And over the years,
he always made money with it.

1307
01:04:03,716 --> 01:04:05,384
In Vegas,
he had the Leaning Tower.

1308
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:07,136
It was a very popular spot.

1309
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:10,014
He had politicians,
Showgirls and movie stars

1310
01:04:10,097 --> 01:04:11,807
hanging out
all over the place.

1311
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:14,351
That show at the Flamingo
just gets better.

1312
01:04:14,435 --> 01:04:17,688
Sammy said whenever you have a minute,
give him a call.

1313
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:19,064
Made a messenger
out of you, too?

1314
01:04:19,231 --> 01:04:20,482
Anything for a buck.

1315
01:04:20,566 --> 01:04:22,151
He does it to everybody.
Enjoy your dinner.

1316
01:04:22,276 --> 01:04:23,861
Thanks.

1317
01:04:23,944 --> 01:04:27,865
But I gotta tell you,
the thing Nicky liked most was the Showgirls.

1318
01:04:27,948 --> 01:04:30,159
To them,
Nicky was the movie star.

1319
01:04:30,242 --> 01:04:31,618
You walk past me?

1320
01:04:31,744 --> 01:04:33,120
Hey! This is Shelly.

1321
01:04:33,203 --> 01:04:34,580
Hey, Shelly. How are you?

1322
01:04:34,747 --> 01:04:36,165
And this is Stacy.

1323
01:04:36,248 --> 01:04:38,042
Stacy.
This is Nick.

1324
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:39,626
They wanna have dinner.
Come on.

1325
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:41,211
All right. Let's
check the kitchen first.

1326
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:42,838
Excuse us one second.

1327
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:46,508
I'll show you. I fly
stuff in fresh every day.

1328
01:04:46,592 --> 01:04:49,553
| Get bread from back home,
fish from California.

1329
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:51,430
You can always
tell a great kitchen like ours

1330
01:04:51,597 --> 01:04:53,348
because
of the milk-fed veal.

1331
01:04:53,432 --> 01:04:56,351
That's the secret.
Milk-fed veal is pure white.

1332
01:04:56,435 --> 01:04:58,062
Out here they
got that pink veal.

1333
01:04:58,187 --> 01:04:59,772
Slide over, honey.

1334
01:05:00,731 --> 01:05:04,026
Now, pink veal,
you can pound that shit for two days.

1335
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:05,486
It'll never, ever get tender.

1336
01:05:05,611 --> 01:05:07,029
You know what I mean?

1337
01:05:07,488 --> 01:05:09,031
I left here with the money.

1338
01:05:09,156 --> 01:05:10,699
Got muscled on the street.

1339
01:05:10,783 --> 01:05:14,161
A couple guys, I owe them,
so I gave them the money.

1340
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:15,996
That's what I did.
Yeah?

1341
01:05:16,288 --> 01:05:18,123
You call yourself a man?

1342
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:20,417
You know you're
a lying lowlife,

1343
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:22,669
motherfucking,
gambling, degenerate prick?

1344
01:05:22,753 --> 01:05:25,631
You know that?
Two small kids at home.

1345
01:05:26,006 --> 01:05:27,841
I gave you money
to pay the fucking rent

1346
01:05:27,966 --> 01:05:29,802
and buy groceries,
put the heat on.

1347
01:05:29,885 --> 01:05:33,263
Your wife called Frankie and told him the fucking heat's off.

1348
01:05:33,472 --> 01:05:35,933
And you didn't
gamble that fucking money?

1349
01:05:36,016 --> 01:05:37,643
No? You didn't?
I didn't...

1350
01:05:37,726 --> 01:05:39,394
Don't fuck with me, AI.

1351
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,230
Don't make a fuck out of me.

1352
01:05:41,313 --> 01:05:44,608
You wanna embarrass me,
make a fool out of me? You didn't gamble?

1353
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:46,819
Tell me you gambled
the fucking money,

1354
01:05:46,985 --> 01:05:49,113
I'll give you
the money to put the heat on.

1355
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:51,865
Did you gamble? Huh?

1356
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:57,329
Fucking degenerate.

1357
01:05:57,955 --> 01:05:59,665
Fucking kids at home.

1358
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:05,420
Here.
Get the fuck out of here.

1359
01:06:06,088 --> 01:06:07,840
Thanks, Nick.
Yeah.

1360
01:06:07,923 --> 01:06:09,508
Let me find out
you fucked up,

1361
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:11,176
I'll leave you
where I find you.

1362
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:13,345
How many of
these you gonna eat?

1363
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:15,013
Two.
- Two?

1364
01:06:15,097 --> 01:06:16,807
But around 6:30 in
the morning,

1365
01:06:16,890 --> 01:06:20,144
when he finished his day,
no matter where he was,

1366
01:06:20,227 --> 01:06:23,438
he always went home to make breakfast for his son,
Nicky boy.

1367
01:06:23,522 --> 01:06:25,607
I know you like this.

1368
01:06:25,732 --> 01:06:27,818
A little butter, right?
Not a lot.

1369
01:06:28,152 --> 01:06:29,778
You know why, right?
Yeah.

1370
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:32,489
'Cause it clogs up
your heart.

1371
01:06:32,573 --> 01:06:37,202
What a smart kid you are.
Okay, eat.

1372
01:06:37,286 --> 01:06:38,620
Every couple of weeks,

1373
01:06:38,704 --> 01:06:41,373
I sent Marino to the bosses
with a piece of what I made.

1374
01:06:41,623 --> 01:06:43,876
Not a big piece,
but what did they know?

1375
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:46,253
They were
1,500 miles away,

1376
01:06:46,378 --> 01:06:48,338
and I don't know anyone
who can see that far.

1377
01:06:48,422 --> 01:06:50,215
Their drop was a garage

1378
01:06:50,299 --> 01:06:52,759
where Remo and the guys hung out and counted their millions.

1379
01:06:53,427 --> 01:06:54,845
Hey, Frankie.

1380
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:57,723
The cops knew
but they didn't give a fuck.

1381
01:06:57,806 --> 01:06:59,433
Nicky sends his
warmest regards.

1382
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:01,476
But I knew how to
keep the bosses happy.

1383
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:05,063
Whenever they gave me little jobs to do,
you know, to send a message,

1384
01:07:05,147 --> 01:07:08,859
I would carry
things out to a T.

1385
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:13,155
Like the time Tony Dogs,
the new maniac tough guy in town,

1386
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:15,407
shot up one of Remo's bars.

1387
01:07:19,745 --> 01:07:24,082
Here 's a guy kills two of Remo's guys and a poor fucking waitress

1388
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:27,336
who was just working on her night off,
of all things.

1389
01:07:29,671 --> 01:07:33,091
I mean,
this guy's just begging to be made an example of.

1390
01:07:33,175 --> 01:07:36,678
Frankie, Iwant the names of all the other people he had with him.

1391
01:07:36,762 --> 01:07:38,430
And I don't care
what you have to do

1392
01:07:38,597 --> 01:07:40,265
to them to get them,
understand?

1393
01:07:40,349 --> 01:07:42,100
I'll take care of it, Remo.

1394
01:07:42,851 --> 01:07:45,979
To be truthful with you,
I had to admire this guy.

1395
01:07:46,104 --> 01:07:48,815
He was one of the toughest Irishmen I ever met.

1396
01:07:48,899 --> 01:07:51,318
This son of
a bitch was tough.

1397
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:52,945
For two fucking
days and nights

1398
01:07:53,070 --> 01:07:54,571
we beat the shit
out of this guy.

1399
01:07:54,655 --> 01:07:56,823
We even stuck ice picks
in his balls.

1400
01:07:56,907 --> 01:07:59,910
He better give me a name or I'm gonna give him yours, Frank.

1401
01:07:59,993 --> 01:08:01,119
Thanks a lot.

1402
01:08:01,203 --> 01:08:02,329
But he never talked.

1403
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:04,039
You would've ratted by now.

1404
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:06,750
In the end,
I had to put his fucking head in a vise.

1405
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:09,419
Dogs, can you hear me, Dogs?

1406
01:08:09,878 --> 01:08:11,546
Listen to me, Antony.

1407
01:08:11,672 --> 01:08:13,382
Igotyourhead
in a fucking vise.

1408
01:08:13,465 --> 01:08:15,217
|'|| Squash your fucking head
like a grapefruit

1409
01:08:15,342 --> 01:08:17,135
ifyou don't give me a name.

1410
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:19,471
Don't make me
have to do this.

1411
01:08:20,097 --> 01:08:22,391
Don't make me be a bad guy.
Come on.

1412
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:24,685
Fuck you.

1413
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:26,270
Motherfucker.
You believe this?

1414
01:08:26,395 --> 01:08:27,896
Two fucking days and nights.

1415
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:31,108
Fuck me?
Fuck me, you motherfucker?

1416
01:08:31,191 --> 01:08:34,069
Fuck my mother?
That what you're saying?

1417
01:08:34,152 --> 01:08:35,821
You motherfucker, you, huh?

1418
01:08:35,946 --> 01:08:36,947
TONY GURGLING

1419
01:08:37,489 --> 01:08:40,158
Oh, God.
Give me the fucking name.

1420
01:08:40,242 --> 01:08:42,202
Charlie M.

1421
01:08:42,286 --> 01:08:43,745
Charlie M.
Charlie M?

1422
01:08:43,829 --> 01:08:47,416
Charlie M?
You make me pop your fucking eye out of yourhead

1423
01:08:47,499 --> 01:08:50,294
to protect that
piece of shit, Charlie M?

1424
01:08:50,377 --> 01:08:52,087
You dumb motherfucker.

1425
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:54,339
Kill me, you fuck. Kill me!

1426
01:08:54,506 --> 01:08:56,675
Kill you?
You motherfucker, you.

1427
01:08:56,758 --> 01:08:59,386
Frankie,
do him a fucking favor.

1428
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:04,266
The word got around that finally
there was a real gangster in town.

1429
01:09:04,808 --> 01:09:07,436
Nicky was the new
boss of Las Vegas.

1430
01:09:07,769 --> 01:09:09,104
Charlie M.

1431
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:13,358
COINS CLINKING

1432
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,319
Four reels, sevens across.

1433
01:09:15,444 --> 01:09:17,112
Three $15,000 jackpots.

1434
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:18,947
Do you have any
idea what the odds are?

1435
01:09:19,031 --> 01:09:21,199
Shoot, it's gotta be
in the millions or more.

1436
01:09:21,283 --> 01:09:23,285
Three fucking jackpots
in 20 minutes?

1437
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:25,454
Why didn't you call me?

1438
01:09:25,537 --> 01:09:26,997
It happened so quick.
Three guys won.

1439
01:09:27,122 --> 01:09:28,582
I didn't have a chance.

1440
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:30,250
You didn't see the scam?

1441
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:32,002
There's no way
to determine that.

1442
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:34,296
Yes, there is.
An infallible way, they won!

1443
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:37,341
It's a casino.
People gotta win sometimes.

1444
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:41,803
Ward, you're pissing me off.
Now you're insulting my intelligence.

1445
01:09:41,887 --> 01:09:44,139
You know somebody
had to get into those machines

1446
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:45,390
and set those reels.

1447
01:09:45,474 --> 01:09:46,767
The probability
on one machine

1448
01:09:46,892 --> 01:09:48,185
is a million-and-a-half
to one.

1449
01:09:48,268 --> 01:09:51,313
On three machines in a row,
it's in the billions. It can't happen.

1450
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:53,565
What's the matter with you?

1451
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:56,360
Didn't you see you were being set up on the second win?

1452
01:09:56,443 --> 01:09:58,487
You didn't see you
were being set up?

1453
01:09:58,612 --> 01:10:00,697
I think you're overreacting.

1454
01:10:00,864 --> 01:10:04,326
You fucking yokel.
I've been carrying your ass ever since I got here.

1455
01:10:04,409 --> 01:10:06,328
Get your ass out of here.

1456
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:08,121
You're firing me?
I'm firing you.

1457
01:10:08,205 --> 01:10:09,998
No, I'm not firing.
I'm firing you.

1458
01:10:10,082 --> 01:10:11,666
You might regret this.

1459
01:10:11,792 --> 01:10:13,418
|'|| Regret it ifl keep you.

1460
01:10:13,502 --> 01:10:15,003
This is not
the way to treat people.

1461
01:10:15,087 --> 01:10:17,881
Ifyou didn't see it,
you're too fucking dumb.

1462
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:20,425
Ifyou did see it, you were in on it.
Either way, you're out.

1463
01:10:20,509 --> 01:10:22,010
Go on. Let's go.

1464
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:26,473
The guy's history
as far as I'm concerned.

1465
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:28,183
You can't fire him.

1466
01:10:28,308 --> 01:10:29,935
His brother-in-Iaw is
County Commissioner.

1467
01:10:30,018 --> 01:10:31,353
Everybody with cowboy boots

1468
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:35,315
is a fucking county commissioner or related to one.

1469
01:10:35,399 --> 01:10:37,317
This is his state.
His uncle's Chief Judge.

1470
01:10:37,401 --> 01:10:39,986
His brother-in-Iaw runs
the County Commission.

1471
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:41,822
There's gotta be a way
to work him back in.

1472
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:43,615
You're in the finances,
you're upstairs.

1473
01:10:43,698 --> 01:10:44,866
You are not on the floor.

1474
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,159
You don't see
what's going on.

1475
01:10:46,243 --> 01:10:48,912
I've got thousands of players,
I've got 500 dealers.

1476
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:51,706
They're all looking to rob me blind 24 hours a day.

1477
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:55,043
L have to let them know I'm watching all the details all the time.

1478
01:10:55,127 --> 01:10:57,838
There is not one single thing
|wi|| not catch.

1479
01:10:59,339 --> 01:11:02,050
Look at yours. Look at that.

1480
01:11:02,134 --> 01:11:04,386
Look at this.
There's nothing.

1481
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:08,265
Look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has.

1482
01:11:08,348 --> 01:11:10,142
What are you talking about?

1483
01:11:10,225 --> 01:11:12,394
Ifyou don't do it yourself,
it never gets done.

1484
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:13,979
Where are you going?

1485
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,357
From now on,
I want you to put an equal amount

1486
01:11:17,482 --> 01:11:19,401
of blueberries in each muffin.

1487
01:11:19,985 --> 01:11:22,988
An equal amount of blueberries in each muffin.

1488
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,407
Do you know how
long that will take?

1489
01:11:25,532 --> 01:11:26,908
I don't care.

1490
01:11:26,992 --> 01:11:29,744
Put an equal amount
in each muffin.

1491
01:11:33,457 --> 01:11:35,584
Come on,
honey, just a little.

1492
01:11:35,709 --> 01:11:37,878
Atta girl. Atta girl.

1493
01:11:37,961 --> 01:11:39,880
Oh, boy, look.
You wanna go to Mommy?

1494
01:11:39,963 --> 01:11:41,339
Wanna come to Mommy?

1495
01:11:41,465 --> 01:11:42,799
It's all right, sweetheart.

1496
01:11:42,883 --> 01:11:46,803
I need to talk to you.
I need some money.

1497
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:48,930
What do you need?

1498
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:50,056
Got her?

1499
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:54,394
I need a lot.
I need more than usual.

1500
01:11:54,478 --> 01:11:56,563
Why don't you take it
out of your account?

1501
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:59,900
I would, you know,
Sam, it'sjust that...

1502
01:12:00,567 --> 01:12:03,320
Well, I need more than that.
I need $25,000.

1503
01:12:04,154 --> 01:12:05,697
$25,000?

1504
01:12:06,823 --> 01:12:08,533
For yourself?
Yeah.

1505
01:12:09,409 --> 01:12:11,495
Why do you need that much?

1506
01:12:11,578 --> 01:12:13,497
What's the difference?
I just need it.

1507
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:16,166
I gotta ask you.
That's a lot of money.

1508
01:12:16,249 --> 01:12:18,043
You're not asking
for a box of popcorn.

1509
01:12:18,126 --> 01:12:20,378
We don't have to turn
this into a big deal.

1510
01:12:20,504 --> 01:12:22,714
Okay? We don't
have to have a fight.

1511
01:12:22,797 --> 01:12:24,508
It was important
to me. Forget it.

1512
01:12:24,591 --> 01:12:25,926
Just something
I wanted to do.

1513
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:30,055
Who's fighting? I mean,
tell me what it's for.

1514
01:12:32,724 --> 01:12:36,895
Why can't you tell
me what it's for? Huh?

1515
01:12:39,814 --> 01:12:41,900
You know what?
Now I want you to tell me.

1516
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:44,653
My wife comes to me
and asks me for $25,000.

1517
01:12:44,736 --> 01:12:46,571
What do you want, a coat?
No.

1518
01:12:46,655 --> 01:12:48,406
If you want a coat,
you got it.

1519
01:12:48,490 --> 01:12:49,741
It's not the money.

1520
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:51,117
It's just,
why do you want it?

1521
01:12:51,201 --> 01:12:52,786
Am I not entitled to ask?

1522
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:54,579
I've been independent
my whole life.

1523
01:12:54,746 --> 01:12:56,498
I never had to ask
anybody for anything.

1524
01:12:56,581 --> 01:12:58,166
Now you're making me beg.

1525
01:12:58,291 --> 01:12:59,876
What are you talking about?

1526
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:01,586
And you're embarrassing me.

1527
01:13:01,753 --> 01:13:03,380
Why do you want to
make me feel so bad?

1528
01:13:03,463 --> 01:13:05,090
You're asking me for $25,000.

1529
01:13:05,215 --> 01:13:06,841
I'm not out
to make you feel bad.

1530
01:13:06,925 --> 01:13:08,510
I want to just be
able to trust you.

1531
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:09,928
You know, it's about trust.

1532
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,932
I have to be able
to trust you with my life.

1533
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:15,600
Do you understand?

1534
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:18,270
Can I trust you?

1535
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:24,025
Can I trust you?

1536
01:13:25,986 --> 01:13:27,571
Can I trust you?

1537
01:13:27,654 --> 01:13:29,531
Answer me, can I trust you?

1538
01:13:31,157 --> 01:13:32,826
You can trust me.

1539
01:13:32,951 --> 01:13:34,619
Good. Then tell me
what the money is for.

1540
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:38,957
THE GLORY OF LOVE PLAYING

1541
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:42,294
SINGING
You’ve got to

1542
01:13:43,253 --> 01:13:45,171
Give a little

1543
01:13:46,715 --> 01:13:49,134
Take a little

1544
01:13:50,635 --> 01:13:53,930
And let your poor heart

1545
01:13:54,347 --> 01:13:56,766
Break a little

1546
01:13:56,933 --> 01:13:59,019
Yeah,
she's leaving the bank now.

1547
01:13:59,811 --> 01:14:01,813
All right,
I'm gonna follow her.

1548
01:14:02,397 --> 01:14:04,190
What is that?
What does that mean?

1549
01:14:04,316 --> 01:14:06,151
I know that look.
What does that look mean?

1550
01:14:06,234 --> 01:14:07,986
It means
I got the money.

1551
01:14:08,153 --> 01:14:09,904
That's a good look.

1552
01:14:10,322 --> 01:14:12,699
SINGING
You’ve got to

1553
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:30,175
How are you doing, Les?
It's Lester, right?

1554
01:14:31,134 --> 01:14:32,510
Sam.

1555
01:14:37,557 --> 01:14:40,310
From my recollection,
aren't you the card shark,

1556
01:14:41,519 --> 01:14:44,481
the golf hustler,
the pimp from Beverly Hills?

1557
01:14:47,192 --> 01:14:49,152
If I'm wrong,
please correct me,

1558
01:14:49,277 --> 01:14:51,196
'cause I never knew
you to be a heist man.

1559
01:14:51,363 --> 01:14:53,323
But ifyou are,
you know what?

1560
01:14:54,324 --> 01:14:55,992
Here, take mine, too.

1561
01:14:56,618 --> 01:14:57,911
Go ahead, take it.

1562
01:14:58,036 --> 01:14:59,371
'Cause you already have hers.

1563
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:01,790
She's my wife.

1564
01:15:02,916 --> 01:15:04,876
Look at me.
You did know that?

1565
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:06,961
You knew that
she's my wife?

1566
01:15:07,545 --> 01:15:08,630
Huh? Hey,
look at me.

1567
01:15:08,755 --> 01:15:09,881
Yeah, I know that.

1568
01:15:09,964 --> 01:15:11,591
You do, yeah?

1569
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:17,514
But ifyou ever
come back again, ever,

1570
01:15:17,931 --> 01:15:20,725
to take her money,
next time bring a pistol.

1571
01:15:20,809 --> 01:15:22,644
That way you got a chance.

1572
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:24,729
Be a man.
Don't be a fucking pimp.

1573
01:15:26,064 --> 01:15:27,774
Now, you wanna
do me a favor?

1574
01:15:27,899 --> 01:15:29,609
Get out of here.

1575
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:31,152
I wanna be alone
with my wife.

1576
01:15:31,236 --> 01:15:32,987
Get the fuck up
and get out of here.

1577
01:15:40,412 --> 01:15:42,080
Fucking piece of shit.

1578
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:43,832
That's fucking bullshit.

1579
01:15:43,915 --> 01:15:46,835
You know? That's fucking...

1580
01:15:46,918 --> 01:15:49,337
SINGING I guess it's best that we should part

1581
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:51,923
That’s the glory of love

1582
01:15:52,549 --> 01:15:56,136
Remember when you called him that night and said goodbye?

1583
01:15:56,219 --> 01:15:59,597
He didn't say, "Don't get married,
I'll be right down."

1584
01:15:59,931 --> 01:16:01,266
No, he didn't.

1585
01:16:01,433 --> 01:16:02,809
No. Instead, what did he say?

1586
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:09,232
"Fuck him.
Take him for everything he's got."

1587
01:16:09,691 --> 01:16:12,110
Come here.
I want to show you something.

1588
01:16:13,903 --> 01:16:15,822
SINGING
That’s the story

1589
01:16:15,947 --> 01:16:17,949
The second letter
came right after

1590
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,286
Come back, you motherfucker.

1591
01:16:21,369 --> 01:16:24,164
No! No, no!

1592
01:16:25,415 --> 01:16:27,500
SCREAMING Make them stop it!

1593
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:32,297
No! No.

1594
01:16:32,714 --> 01:16:36,468
It's not his fault!
It's my fault!

1595
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:45,059
SCREAMING No!

1596
01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:47,312
GINGER SCREAMING

1597
01:16:48,229 --> 01:16:49,898
Fuck!

1598
01:16:50,023 --> 01:16:51,733
Piece of shit.

1599
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:54,235
GINGER HYSTERICALLY SOBBING

1600
01:16:59,657 --> 01:17:02,911
Why didn't you do it yourself,
you chickenshit cocksucker?

1601
01:17:03,912 --> 01:17:05,830
He's such a prick!

1602
01:17:05,914 --> 01:17:08,416
He had some guy
from the hotel beat him up.

1603
01:17:08,917 --> 01:17:10,502
He didn't want
to do it himself.

1604
01:17:10,585 --> 01:17:13,630
Oh, no, he didn't want
to get his own hands dirty.

1605
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:18,384
So why did he
have to do that, huh?

1606
01:17:18,468 --> 01:17:19,969
Tell me.

1607
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:22,096
I know itwasn't
a nice thing to do...

1608
01:17:22,222 --> 01:17:23,598
Noshm

1609
01:17:23,681 --> 01:17:24,682
You gotta understand,

1610
01:17:24,808 --> 01:17:27,018
he doesn't know if this guy
is shaking you down...

1611
01:17:27,101 --> 01:17:28,645
No. No.

1612
01:17:29,187 --> 01:17:32,106
I told him about this guy
before we got married.

1613
01:17:32,190 --> 01:17:33,817
This is no fucking surprise.

1614
01:17:33,858 --> 01:17:35,860
Yeah. Oh, you did?
I didn't know that.

1615
01:17:35,944 --> 01:17:39,280
He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help.
So what?

1616
01:17:39,531 --> 01:17:43,701
You know, the first time
I ever saw you guys together,

1617
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:46,287
I never saw him so happy.

1618
01:17:46,704 --> 01:17:49,707
I know he's a crazy
Jew fuck and everything,

1619
01:17:49,874 --> 01:17:53,461
butlneverseen him act like that with anybody else.

1620
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:56,214
I think he's crazy about you.

1621
01:17:56,339 --> 01:17:58,091
I mean, he really loves you.
He does.

1622
01:17:58,174 --> 01:18:01,678
Come on. Iwent into this
with my eyes open, you know.

1623
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:04,514
I knew the bottom
could drop out at any time.

1624
01:18:04,597 --> 01:18:08,101
I'm a working girl.
You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this

1625
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:10,353
if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end?

1626
01:18:10,436 --> 01:18:11,563
Sure, I can see that.
Right?

1627
01:18:13,481 --> 01:18:15,191
So he put aside
some jewelry for me.

1628
01:18:15,316 --> 01:18:17,068
A lot ofjewelry.

1629
01:18:17,151 --> 01:18:18,653
You mean like a lot
of expensive jewelry?

1630
01:18:18,778 --> 01:18:20,321
About how much?

1631
01:18:20,655 --> 01:18:22,866
You want to steal it?

1632
01:18:22,991 --> 01:18:25,159
No. I'm just curious.

1633
01:18:25,243 --> 01:18:29,080
I was wondering,
how much he would put into a thing like that.

1634
01:18:29,163 --> 01:18:31,833
I'm told it's worth about$1 million,
maybe more.

1635
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:34,043
Well, there you go.
What does that tell you?

1636
01:18:34,168 --> 01:18:36,296
$1 million injewelry.

1637
01:18:36,629 --> 01:18:39,007
The guy is crazy about you.

1638
01:18:39,090 --> 01:18:40,842
I should've
never married him.

1639
01:18:40,967 --> 01:18:42,677
He's a Gemini.

1640
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:45,346
Triple Gemini. Duality.

1641
01:18:45,763 --> 01:18:47,265
SNIFFLING Gemini
is the snake, you know.

1642
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:48,850
You can't trust a snake.

1643
01:18:50,935 --> 01:18:52,145
I mean it.

1644
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:53,479
I know what you mean.

1645
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:55,315
Listen, Ginger.

1646
01:18:55,982 --> 01:18:57,692
You know,
this is probably not...

1647
01:18:57,817 --> 01:18:59,569
I don't have
the answers anyway.

1648
01:18:59,944 --> 01:19:01,487
This is probably not
what you want to hear...

1649
01:19:01,613 --> 01:19:03,489
I do.
...'Cause you're a little upset with Ace

1650
01:19:03,573 --> 01:19:05,158
and I understand that.

1651
01:19:05,992 --> 01:19:08,077
But I think you should try
to make the best of it now.

1652
01:19:08,202 --> 01:19:10,288
Go slow. See what happens.

1653
01:19:10,371 --> 01:19:12,415
He could've killed him! Okay?

1654
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:14,542
He didn't have
to hit him.

1655
01:19:14,626 --> 01:19:16,544
It's not like I'm
sleeping with the guy.

1656
01:19:16,628 --> 01:19:19,213
He makes me sneak around
to see my own friends.

1657
01:19:19,297 --> 01:19:21,215
What the fuck
is that all about?

1658
01:19:21,299 --> 01:19:24,844
I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much,
he's jealous and worried.

1659
01:19:25,303 --> 01:19:27,472
Like he gives
a fuck what I do.

1660
01:19:29,057 --> 01:19:30,683
I'll try to find out
what the hell is going on.

1661
01:19:30,808 --> 01:19:32,435
When I see him,
I'll talkto him.

1662
01:19:32,518 --> 01:19:33,686
Okay.

1663
01:19:33,978 --> 01:19:35,688
Yeah.
All right?

1664
01:19:36,981 --> 01:19:40,985
Thanks. Thanks for
putting up with me.

1665
01:19:41,069 --> 01:19:42,779
Take it easy with this shit.

1666
01:19:42,904 --> 01:19:44,572
This can only
make matters worse.

1667
01:19:44,656 --> 01:19:45,698
You're a beautiful girl.

1668
01:19:45,865 --> 01:19:48,493
I've seen a lot of girls
get shot to hell from this.

1669
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:52,080
You're so nice.

1670
01:19:52,622 --> 01:19:53,957
Come on, now.

1671
01:19:54,082 --> 01:19:55,416
I don't wanna
see you unhappy.

1672
01:19:58,002 --> 01:19:59,629
Thanks.

1673
01:20:03,091 --> 01:20:04,217
Thank you.

1674
01:20:04,342 --> 01:20:05,510
It's all right.

1675
01:20:14,686 --> 01:20:16,020
PHONE RINGING

1676
01:20:18,773 --> 01:20:21,943
Mr.
Rothstein, County Commissioner Pat Webb is here to see you.

1677
01:20:22,026 --> 01:20:23,444
Give me a minute.
Okay.

1678
01:20:23,528 --> 01:20:24,737
He'll bejusta minute.

1679
01:20:42,046 --> 01:20:44,507
Mr.
Webb, can I get you anything?

1680
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:46,926
No, thank you,
little lady.

1681
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:49,554
Okay, send him in,
call me four minutes after.

1682
01:20:49,637 --> 01:20:52,432
Mr. Rothstein, I'm Pat Webb.

1683
01:20:52,932 --> 01:20:53,975
How do you do?

1684
01:20:54,058 --> 01:20:55,935
It is a pleasure.
I've heard a lot about you.

1685
01:20:56,019 --> 01:20:59,397
Oh, thank you, sir.
Hey, house is doing well.

1686
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:02,358
Hey, all that money
is rolling in.

1687
01:21:02,442 --> 01:21:05,486
I appreciate you taking the time to see a poor civil servant.

1688
01:21:05,570 --> 01:21:06,821
Why don't you
have a seat?

1689
01:21:06,946 --> 01:21:08,239
Thank you, sir.

1690
01:21:08,865 --> 01:21:12,493
I come here personally
to kind of smooth over

1691
01:21:12,577 --> 01:21:14,537
any fracas about
a certain matter.

1692
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:16,581
Maybe you didn't know it,

1693
01:21:16,664 --> 01:21:19,792
but Don Ward is a very
well-liked man in this town.

1694
01:21:19,876 --> 01:21:22,003
He's got lots of friends,
nice family

1695
01:21:22,128 --> 01:21:24,255
and their money go
back many, many years.

1696
01:21:24,338 --> 01:21:27,842
Now, friends vote.
Family and money votes.

1697
01:21:27,925 --> 01:21:30,928
That's important
to me and you.

1698
01:21:31,012 --> 01:21:35,725
And ifyou'll think about our little problem along them lines,

1699
01:21:36,601 --> 01:21:38,686
and you'll forgive
me for saying it,

1700
01:21:38,770 --> 01:21:41,439
maybe he did not
deserve to be fired.

1701
01:21:42,356 --> 01:21:45,401
He knew about our getting hit
on three big machines in a row

1702
01:21:45,485 --> 01:21:46,903
and he did nothing about it.

1703
01:21:46,986 --> 01:21:51,574
So he was in on it or he was too dumb to see what was going on.

1704
01:21:51,657 --> 01:21:54,035
Either way,
I cannot have a man like that working here.

1705
01:21:54,118 --> 01:21:57,497
Before we point the dirty end
of the stick at old Don,

1706
01:21:57,580 --> 01:22:00,166
we better be sure
we can prove them charges.

1707
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:02,877
Believe me, if I could prove it,
he would be under arrest.

1708
01:22:04,087 --> 01:22:05,088
Are...

1709
01:22:05,171 --> 01:22:06,172
CLEARING THROAT

1710
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:10,218
Are we certain that you want
the Gaming Control Board

1711
01:22:10,301 --> 01:22:14,097
eyeballing your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?

1712
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:16,516
You're way out of line
talking to me like that.

1713
01:22:16,599 --> 01:22:21,145
That's libelous and you're in no position to challenge my expertise.

1714
01:22:21,229 --> 01:22:24,440
I went way out of my way to be very helpful to that kid.

1715
01:22:24,524 --> 01:22:26,442
He's weak. He's incompetent.

1716
01:22:26,567 --> 01:22:28,486
He jeopardizes
the whole place.

1717
01:22:28,569 --> 01:22:30,363
There's not much
more I can do for him.

1718
01:22:30,488 --> 01:22:31,697
You have got me there.

1719
01:22:31,781 --> 01:22:32,782
LAUGHS

1720
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:36,244
Old Don is as useless
as tits on a boar.

1721
01:22:36,494 --> 01:22:37,495
PAT COUGHS

1722
01:22:37,578 --> 01:22:39,831
But he is my brother-in-Iaw

1723
01:22:40,498 --> 01:22:43,000
and Iwould look on
it as a personal favor

1724
01:22:43,084 --> 01:22:45,044
ifyou'd think some more
on hiring him back.

1725
01:22:46,254 --> 01:22:47,839
I can't do that.

1726
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:52,051
I appreciate that he's your brother-in-Iaw and I do want to help you.

1727
01:22:52,135 --> 01:22:53,553
I like to do favors.

1728
01:22:53,636 --> 01:22:55,847
And I know who you are
but I cannot do that.

1729
01:22:58,182 --> 01:23:03,521
Well, could there be any position farther down the trough?

1730
01:23:06,524 --> 01:23:07,984
I'm sorry,
I can't do anything.

1731
01:23:08,067 --> 01:23:11,195
He's too incompetent
and he cannot be trusted.

1732
01:23:11,696 --> 01:23:12,697
PHONE RINGS

1733
01:23:14,365 --> 01:23:16,033
Okay. Thanks.

1734
01:23:18,035 --> 01:23:21,038
No. That's it. I'm sorry.

1735
01:23:21,831 --> 01:23:27,044
Mr.
Rothstein, your people never will understand the way it works out here.

1736
01:23:28,045 --> 01:23:30,214
You're all just our guests.

1737
01:23:30,715 --> 01:23:32,717
But you act like
you're at home.

1738
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:34,594
Let me tell you
something, partner.

1739
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:36,304
You ain't home.

1740
01:23:36,971 --> 01:23:40,308
But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.

1741
01:23:43,311 --> 01:23:44,645
Thank you for your time.

1742
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:46,105
No problem.

1743
01:23:47,064 --> 01:23:48,065
Sorry.

1744
01:23:48,232 --> 01:23:49,275
You bet.

1745
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:55,990
What happened to my pills?

1746
01:23:58,618 --> 01:24:00,161
Your drinking is bad enough.

1747
01:24:00,286 --> 01:24:01,829
You're taking my pills, too?

1748
01:24:01,913 --> 01:24:03,497
I didn't
take your pills.

1749
01:24:03,581 --> 01:24:06,209
Look, for my ulcer,
I take a half of one of these

1750
01:24:06,292 --> 01:24:09,337
and that's when I
have extreme pain.

1751
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:10,838
I had a three-month supply.

1752
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:12,423
What did you do with them?

1753
01:24:12,757 --> 01:24:14,425
CRYING You didn't
have to beat him up.

1754
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:16,177
What?

1755
01:24:17,136 --> 01:24:19,305
Iwasjust
trying to help him.

1756
01:24:20,598 --> 01:24:22,558
It's not like I'm
sleeping with the guy.

1757
01:24:22,683 --> 01:24:24,602
Yeah, how do I know?

1758
01:24:25,645 --> 01:24:29,607
You can't make me stop caring about people.
What? What?

1759
01:24:30,024 --> 01:24:36,197
I said, you can't make me
stop caring about people.

1760
01:24:42,912 --> 01:24:44,330
Listen.

1761
01:24:45,623 --> 01:24:49,460
Ginger, I'm trying to make the best of everything here,
you know?

1762
01:24:49,543 --> 01:24:52,046
I mean, you're my wife,
for Christ's sakes.

1763
01:24:52,129 --> 01:24:55,216
I mean, people look up to you in this town.
I don't know what to do...

1764
01:24:55,633 --> 01:24:59,053
You know what, Ace?
I don't give a shit!

1765
01:24:59,136 --> 01:25:02,348
I'm getting out
of here. I am.

1766
01:25:08,604 --> 01:25:09,605
You gotta get
hold of yourself.

1767
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:10,731
Okay.

1768
01:25:10,815 --> 01:25:11,983
If not for me,
at least for Amy.

1769
01:25:12,108 --> 01:25:13,234
Okay.

1770
01:25:13,317 --> 01:25:14,652
Understand?

1771
01:25:14,819 --> 01:25:16,153
Your drinking's
getting way out of hand.

1772
01:25:16,237 --> 01:25:17,905
I'm gonna get
you into a program.

1773
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:19,699
They got plenty of good ones.

1774
01:25:19,991 --> 01:25:21,534
I don't need one.

1775
01:25:21,659 --> 01:25:23,202
Yes, you do.
It's very discreet.

1776
01:25:23,286 --> 01:25:25,246
There's no names
in the papers.

1777
01:25:25,329 --> 01:25:27,331
That's all you care about.

1778
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:30,334
You don't care about me.

1779
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:31,752
Yes, I do.

1780
01:25:31,836 --> 01:25:33,921
No, you don't.
How could you say that?

1781
01:25:34,005 --> 01:25:37,008
You're a beautiful woman,
you're destroying yourself.

1782
01:25:37,091 --> 01:25:38,384
You don't need that.

1783
01:25:38,467 --> 01:25:40,469
You don't need that fucking leech living off you.

1784
01:25:41,012 --> 01:25:43,097
I know you better
than you know yourself.

1785
01:25:43,222 --> 01:25:45,308
You're a tiger,
you're stronger than lam.

1786
01:25:45,391 --> 01:25:47,310
When you set
your mind on doing something,

1787
01:25:47,435 --> 01:25:49,353
you do it better than anybody.

1788
01:25:53,858 --> 01:25:56,569
You're gonna do it.
Okay? You'll do it.

1789
01:25:56,652 --> 01:25:57,987
Oh, God.

1790
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:00,531
Oh, God.

1791
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:02,783
SOBBING

1792
01:26:02,867 --> 01:26:05,828
Okay. Okay.

1793
01:26:07,705 --> 01:26:10,041
I'll try. I'll try.

1794
01:26:10,207 --> 01:26:13,711
I'll try. |Wi||.

1795
01:26:14,962 --> 01:26:17,131
Don't be mad
at me, okay?

1796
01:26:18,507 --> 01:26:19,884
|Wi||.

1797
01:26:29,185 --> 01:26:32,021
No matter what the problems were outside the count room,

1798
01:26:32,813 --> 01:26:34,815
it was all worth it.

1799
01:26:34,899 --> 01:26:36,984
The cash kept rolling in

1800
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:40,404
and the suitcases
kept coming and going.

1801
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:46,035
And let me tell you,
the fucking bottom line here is cash.

1802
01:26:47,411 --> 01:26:49,789
The only problem was
that after a while,

1803
01:26:49,872 --> 01:26:53,918
the bosses noticed that the suitcases were getting a little light.

1804
01:26:54,377 --> 01:26:56,921
Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me

1805
01:26:57,088 --> 01:26:59,632
that the money we're
robbing is being robbed?

1806
01:26:59,715 --> 01:27:01,592
That somebody's
robbing from us?

1807
01:27:01,675 --> 01:27:04,845
We go through all this trouble and somebody's robbing us?

1808
01:27:05,388 --> 01:27:07,431
Like I said,
it's part of the business.

1809
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:09,558
It's considered leakage.

1810
01:27:09,642 --> 01:27:10,893
Leakage, my balls.

1811
01:27:11,018 --> 01:27:12,228
I want the guy
who's robbing us.

1812
01:27:12,311 --> 01:27:14,980
Even John Nance,
that’s the guy who ran the scam,

1813
01:27:15,064 --> 01:27:17,149
he knew there wasn’t much
he could do about it.

1814
01:27:17,233 --> 01:27:19,568
You gotta know that a guy who helps you steal,

1815
01:27:19,652 --> 01:27:21,695
even if you
take care of him real well,

1816
01:27:21,779 --> 01:27:24,073
he’s gonna steal
a little extra for himself.

1817
01:27:24,198 --> 01:27:26,534
Makes sense, don't it? Right?

1818
01:27:26,617 --> 01:27:29,995
Try and make these hardheaded old greaseballs understand that.

1819
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:32,581
What's the point of skimming
if we're being skimmed?

1820
01:27:32,665 --> 01:27:34,959
It defeats the purpose.

1821
01:27:35,626 --> 01:27:37,795
They take money
because they're my guys,

1822
01:27:37,962 --> 01:27:40,131
so you gotta
give them some leeway.

1823
01:27:40,464 --> 01:27:44,385
But the bosses never believed in leeway,
so listen to what they do.

1824
01:27:44,468 --> 01:27:47,430
They put Artie Piscano,
the underboss of K. C.,

1825
01:27:47,513 --> 01:27:51,142
in charge of making sure
nobody skimmed the skim.

1826
01:27:51,225 --> 01:27:52,393
What were you doing?

1827
01:27:52,518 --> 01:27:53,686
I was with my goomah.

1828
01:27:53,769 --> 01:27:55,312
What are you doing
with your goomah?

1829
01:27:55,479 --> 01:27:57,022
I gave her a schiaffo.

1830
01:27:57,106 --> 01:27:59,817
The only trouble was
Piscano was a disaster.

1831
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:01,944
This guy could fuck
up a cup of coffee.

1832
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:03,362
What you
been doing?

1833
01:28:03,487 --> 01:28:04,864
I'm out there
more than I'm here.

1834
01:28:04,947 --> 01:28:07,741
And if anybody had
known where this would lead,

1835
01:28:07,825 --> 01:28:11,036
they would've been better off
making fucking novenas.

1836
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:12,997
You gotta go back
and talk to that guy.

1837
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:14,832
I never got my expenses
for the last trip.

1838
01:28:14,957 --> 01:28:16,709
VVhatexpenses?

1839
01:28:16,792 --> 01:28:18,586
I'm laying money
out of my own pocket

1840
01:28:18,711 --> 01:28:20,546
and I never get
anything back.

1841
01:28:20,629 --> 01:28:22,339
You gotta go back out there.

1842
01:28:22,465 --> 01:28:24,133
I'm gonna start
keeping records.

1843
01:28:24,216 --> 01:28:26,177
No records, Artie.

1844
01:28:26,302 --> 01:28:28,220
What are you gonna do
with records, pay taxes?

1845
01:28:28,304 --> 01:28:31,849
I can't keep laying out my own fucking dough for these trips.

1846
01:28:31,932 --> 01:28:33,934
What the hell are
we doing over here?

1847
01:28:34,018 --> 01:28:37,104
You're going
to Las Vegas at my expense.

1848
01:28:37,188 --> 01:28:39,106
What the fuck?
I mean, after all...

1849
01:28:39,190 --> 01:28:41,025
No matter how many
novenas you could make,

1850
01:28:41,108 --> 01:28:43,777
nothing was gonna
stop what came up next.

1851
01:28:43,861 --> 01:28:45,529
I can't believe
you're doing this.

1852
01:28:45,654 --> 01:28:47,281
We made a deal.
You came to me.

1853
01:28:47,364 --> 01:28:49,283
It turned out Phil Green,
"Mr. Integrity,"

1854
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:51,368
had a partner
nobody knew about

1855
01:28:51,452 --> 01:28:54,830
and when she showed up,
demanding money from the Tangiers...

1856
01:28:54,914 --> 01:28:56,207
Why are you doing this?

1857
01:28:56,373 --> 01:28:57,666
Because you're wrong.

1858
01:28:57,750 --> 01:28:59,126
I'm not.
Yes, you are.

1859
01:28:59,210 --> 01:29:00,336
I am not wrong.

1860
01:29:00,419 --> 01:29:02,087
...Green tried
to stonewall her.

1861
01:29:02,171 --> 01:29:04,715
|Wi|| see to it that you do not get away with this.

1862
01:29:04,798 --> 01:29:06,467
So she sued him in court.

1863
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:09,178
The court will now hear the matter of the plaintiff,
Anna Scott,

1864
01:29:09,261 --> 01:29:12,932
against Tangiers Corporation and its President,
Philip Green.

1865
01:29:13,557 --> 01:29:15,309
John Marmot on
behalf of Mr. Green.

1866
01:29:15,434 --> 01:29:17,228
Victor Oberon on
behalf ofAnna Scott.

1867
01:29:17,311 --> 01:29:18,437
Mr. Oberon, proceed.

1868
01:29:18,562 --> 01:29:19,980
GAVEL POUNDING
- Thank you, Judge.

1869
01:29:20,064 --> 01:29:23,484
I believe he was fair,
and I'm delighted with the decision.

1870
01:29:23,567 --> 01:29:25,110
We got a problem.

1871
01:29:28,405 --> 01:29:30,115
It didn't go too well.

1872
01:29:30,199 --> 01:29:31,909
Green has to
open up the books,

1873
01:29:32,034 --> 01:29:33,744
has to show how he
got the financing.

1874
01:29:33,827 --> 01:29:36,121
And hey, that's not good.

1875
01:29:38,123 --> 01:29:39,124
MUTTERS

1876
01:29:39,667 --> 01:29:41,669
She was doing pretty
good with her lawsuit.

1877
01:29:41,752 --> 01:29:43,963
But before she could start
counting her money,

1878
01:29:44,046 --> 01:29:47,341
the boys back home decided to settle the case out of court.

1879
01:29:47,424 --> 01:29:48,801
So they sent me.

1880
01:30:04,858 --> 01:30:06,527
REPORTER

1881
01:30:06,652 --> 01:30:08,320
What?

1882
01:30:08,404 --> 01:30:11,031

1885
01:30:15,369 --> 01:30:19,039
We were involved in minor real estate deals many years ago.

1886
01:30:19,123 --> 01:30:20,958
It was never a partnership.

1887
01:30:22,084 --> 01:30:24,628
REPORTER

1888
01:30:24,962 --> 01:30:27,214
Now,
instead of the cops only looking at Nicky,

1889
01:30:27,339 --> 01:30:29,550
they started
looking at Green, too.

1890
01:30:29,633 --> 01:30:32,386
And he was supposed to be
our squeaky-clean front man.

1891
01:30:32,469 --> 01:30:34,221
I had to start
giving interviews

1892
01:30:34,305 --> 01:30:37,057
so everybody knew the casino
was on the up-and—up.

1893
01:30:37,141 --> 01:30:40,019
So how often do you
really fill in for him?

1894
01:30:43,314 --> 01:30:45,816
Green's here about two or three times a month

1895
01:30:45,941 --> 01:30:48,402
and he's busy
with real estate deals.

1896
01:30:49,361 --> 01:30:51,447
So in Green's absence,
you're the boss?

1897
01:30:52,364 --> 01:30:55,409
I serve at the pleasure
of the Chairman of the Board

1898
01:30:56,035 --> 01:31:00,164
and my responsibilities are to run the day-to-day operations.

1899
01:31:00,247 --> 01:31:02,124
So day-to-day,
then, you're the boss?

1900
01:31:02,207 --> 01:31:05,002
Well, in a sense,
you could say that

1901
01:31:05,502 --> 01:31:08,839
I am the boss
when Mr. Green is away.

1902
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:12,760
You could say that.

1903
01:31:14,219 --> 01:31:17,514
Have you read this?
It's about Mr. Rothstein.

1904
01:31:18,223 --> 01:31:21,644
It says,
"The Midwest bookmaker with mob ties

1905
01:31:21,727 --> 01:31:23,187
"says that he is
the real boss

1906
01:31:23,312 --> 01:31:25,856
of the $100 million
Tangiers casino empire."

1907
01:31:26,607 --> 01:31:27,941
Do you believe that?

1908
01:31:28,067 --> 01:31:29,401
Did he really say that?

1909
01:31:29,485 --> 01:31:32,279
Why, of course he said that.
It's right here.

1910
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:36,241
Has that man even
filed for his license yet?

1911
01:31:36,325 --> 01:31:38,410
I don't know.
We have to check the files.

1912
01:31:38,494 --> 01:31:41,664
Without getting your shorts in a knot,
would you do that?

1913
01:31:41,747 --> 01:31:45,751
Check closely,
'cause we may have to kick a kike's ass out of town.

1914
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,295
Thank you.

A Gaming Control Board
investigation

1916
01:31:51,882 --> 01:31:56,512
of Tangiers executive Sam Rothstein's
gaming license application is under way.

1917
01:31:56,595 --> 01:31:59,556
Rothstein, who heads
the Tangiers casino operation

1918
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:04,103
and is a boyhood friend of Las Vegas mob boss Nicky Santoro,

1919
01:32:04,186 --> 01:32:06,230
could lose his ability
to work in the casino...

I gotta meet Clean Face.
What about the Chez Paris?

1924
01:32:15,906 --> 01:32:18,200
You can't. You gotta make a reservation.
It's all booked up.

1925
01:32:18,283 --> 01:32:20,911
No, no. It's okay.
It's impossible.

1926
01:32:20,994 --> 01:32:22,913
You gotta make a reservation.
It's difficult to get in.

1927
01:32:24,206 --> 01:32:26,250
It's okay, I'll use the service entrance.
I'll see you at 9:00.

Sam "Ace" Rothstein,
is heating up.

1931
01:32:36,510 --> 01:32:40,973
Tonight, a look at Ace Rothstein's attempt to get state licensing

1932

despite allegations of Rothstein's organized crime connections.

1933

Will Rothstein's friendship with alleged
organized crime figure Nicky Santoro

1934
01:32:49,648 --> 01:32:52,526
keep him from running
the Tangiers casino?

1935
01:32:52,609 --> 01:32:54,611
Can the integrity
of gaming laws

1936
01:32:54,737 --> 01:32:56,697
be jeopardized by
a boyhood friendship?

1937
01:32:56,780 --> 01:32:59,450
Why don't you take it easy on that stuff, huh?

1938
01:33:00,159 --> 01:33:02,786
Come on.
Let me help you down. Come on.

1939
01:33:03,078 --> 01:33:04,788
We're talking
about some stuff.

1940
01:33:04,872 --> 01:33:08,876
Will a boyhood friendship
unseat Rothstein as the Tangiers casino boss?

Exclusive on the KBBO
special news report.

1942
01:33:13,672 --> 01:33:16,759
Go down.
Just... Go downstairs.

1943
01:33:21,263 --> 01:33:22,973
You can't let this
concern you, Ace.

1944
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:24,892
Don't worry
about that stuff.

1945
01:33:24,975 --> 01:33:27,060
It's just a political
witch hunt.

1946
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:32,941
Hey, Ace.

1947
01:33:34,693 --> 01:33:36,278
Do you want
something to drink?

1948
01:33:36,403 --> 01:33:37,946
Charlie, a refill?

1949
01:33:38,030 --> 01:33:39,698
Yeah, refill
would be great.

1950
01:33:39,823 --> 01:33:41,492
Hey, Mr. Clark.

1951
01:33:41,742 --> 01:33:43,952
You're tougher to
reach than the President.

1952
01:33:44,036 --> 01:33:45,496
I've been busy.

1953
01:33:45,579 --> 01:33:47,998
Least you could do is
return my phone calls.

1954
01:33:48,081 --> 01:33:51,168
Listen, Nicky,
we talked about this.

1955
01:33:51,835 --> 01:33:56,590
And I explained to you that you might have to take some kind of loss.

1956
01:33:57,758 --> 01:33:58,967
Yeah.

1957
01:33:59,885 --> 01:34:01,470
I think I want my money back.

1958
01:34:03,013 --> 01:34:05,641
What are you gonna do,
strong-arm me?

1959
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:08,519
You know,
I think you've gotten

1960
01:34:08,644 --> 01:34:10,312
the wrong
impression about me.

1961
01:34:11,021 --> 01:34:13,357
I think, in all fairness,
I should explain

1962
01:34:13,524 --> 01:34:15,859
to you exactly
what it is that I do.

1963
01:34:16,777 --> 01:34:21,240
Tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early,
take a walk to the bank,

1964
01:34:21,782 --> 01:34:25,327
walk in and see you,
and ifyou don't have my money for me,

1965

that I'm coming out ofjail,

1967
01:34:32,793 --> 01:34:36,004
hopefully, you'll be coming out of your coma.

1968
01:34:36,547 --> 01:34:38,298
And guess what?

1969
01:34:38,382 --> 01:34:42,177
|'|| Split your fucking head open again,
'cause I'm fucking stupid.

1970

aboutjail.

That's my business,
that's what I do.

We know what you do.

1973
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:52,187
You fuck people out of money
and get away with it.

1974
01:34:52,271 --> 01:34:53,856
You can't talk
to me like that.

1975
01:34:53,981 --> 01:34:55,524
You put my money
to sleep!

1976
01:34:55,607 --> 01:34:58,026
Get my money or I'll put your brain to sleep.

1977
01:34:58,110 --> 01:34:59,194
Sam.

1978
01:34:59,319 --> 01:35:00,404
Never mind Sam.
This is personal.

1979
01:35:00,487 --> 01:35:01,738
I'll be there
in the morning.

1980
01:35:01,822 --> 01:35:03,991
You can try me, fatso.
You fucking try me.

1981
01:35:06,326 --> 01:35:07,578
You think
he got the point?

1982
01:35:07,661 --> 01:35:10,664
He's a square guy,
for Christ's sakes.

1983
01:35:10,747 --> 01:35:12,416
He's gonna run to the FBI.

1984
01:35:12,499 --> 01:35:13,834
Fuck the FBI.

1985
01:35:13,917 --> 01:35:16,253
That prick's been dodging me
for three weeks.

1986
01:35:16,336 --> 01:35:18,755
You're trying to
tell me what to do.

1987
01:35:18,922 --> 01:35:21,341
I'm not but you're
way out of line, Nick.

1988
01:35:21,425 --> 01:35:23,385
Where's your head?

1989
01:35:23,510 --> 01:35:25,470
Where's your fucking balls?
Huh?

1990
01:35:25,554 --> 01:35:27,890
You know I'm trying to put something big together here.

1991
01:35:27,973 --> 01:35:30,434
You know what
I'm talking about.

1992
01:35:30,559 --> 01:35:32,853
IfyouTe acting like this now,
how can I depend on you?

1993
01:35:32,936 --> 01:35:34,688
A lot of things gonna change.

1994
01:35:34,771 --> 01:35:37,983
Ifyou wanna be there,
you're gonna have to go my fucking way.

1995
01:35:38,066 --> 01:35:41,528
Listen, Nicky,
I'm responsible for thousands of people.

1996
01:35:41,612 --> 01:35:43,655
I got $100 million a year
going through the place.

1997
01:35:43,739 --> 01:35:47,200
It's all over
if I don't get that license.

1998
01:35:47,284 --> 01:35:51,371
If it goes bad for me,
it's gonna go bad for a lot of people.

1999
01:35:51,455 --> 01:35:52,789
Forget your license.

2000
01:35:52,873 --> 01:35:56,168
| Plant my own flag here and you ain't gonna need a license.

2001
01:35:57,961 --> 01:36:01,006
I don't know what it is, Sammy,
but the more | talk to you,

2002
01:36:01,089 --> 01:36:03,842
the more | feel like you don't want to go along with me.

2003

No, I don't want to
come along with you.

2004
01:36:05,636 --> 01:36:07,220
Okay, fine.

2005
01:36:07,304 --> 01:36:09,932
I don't want to be
involved with it.

2006
01:36:10,015 --> 01:36:11,266

2007
01:36:11,391 --> 01:36:12,643
| Just want my license.

2008
01:36:12,726 --> 01:36:14,978
I want everything quiet.
That's it.

2009
01:36:15,062 --> 01:36:16,313
Quiet like this?
"I'm the boss"?

2010
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:17,731
That's quiet?

2011
01:36:17,814 --> 01:36:19,483
I had no control over that.

2012
01:36:19,566 --> 01:36:21,318
Ronnie and Billy
will tell you what happened.

2013
01:36:21,401 --> 01:36:23,946
Back home that looks bad.

2014
01:36:24,029 --> 01:36:26,198
Bad? Every time
you're on television,

2015
01:36:26,323 --> 01:36:28,533
| get mentioned.
That looks bad.

2016
01:36:28,617 --> 01:36:30,619
What the fuck
happened to you?

2017
01:36:30,744 --> 01:36:32,746
What happened to you?
You lost control.

2018
01:36:32,829 --> 01:36:34,539
I lost control?

2019
01:36:34,665 --> 01:36:36,416
You're walking around
like John Barrymore.

2020
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:38,669
A pink robe and
a fucking cigarette holder?

2021
01:36:38,794 --> 01:36:40,963
I lost control?

2022
01:36:41,046 --> 01:36:42,422
I don't wanna bring this up,

2023
01:36:42,506 --> 01:36:46,510
but you been treating people with disrespect,
even your wife.

2024
01:36:46,843 --> 01:36:49,262
What does she have
to do with all this?

2025
01:36:49,346 --> 01:36:51,390
She was upset
about a lot of things,

2026
01:36:51,473 --> 01:36:54,810
especially that fucking
Lester Diamond incident.

2027
01:36:54,935 --> 01:36:56,687
You're the shoulder
to cry on?

2028
01:36:56,812 --> 01:36:58,522
Did you her tell
about your role in that?

2029
01:36:58,605 --> 01:37:01,024
No, that's not
the fucking point.

2030
01:37:01,108 --> 01:37:04,611
The point is she's upset,
and you've got a fucking problem.

2031
01:37:04,695 --> 01:37:07,948
I would appreciate it ifyou stay out of my personal life.

2032
01:37:08,031 --> 01:37:10,200
She came to talk to me.

2033
01:37:10,367 --> 01:37:12,536
What was I supposed to do?
Throw her out?

2034
01:37:12,619 --> 01:37:14,454
Stay away.
It's none of your business.

2035
01:37:14,579 --> 01:37:16,415
It's none of my business?

2036
01:37:16,498 --> 01:37:18,917
A week ago it was my business,
now it's not.

2037
01:37:19,001 --> 01:37:21,670
So when you need me to take care of things,
you need me?

2038
01:37:21,753 --> 01:37:24,965
Yeah, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen.

2039
01:37:25,048 --> 01:37:27,300
I'm gonna have to straighten out what you did.

2040
01:37:27,384 --> 01:37:29,386
This guy is
gonna run to the FBI.

2041
01:37:29,511 --> 01:37:31,513
Your head's bigger
than your casino.

2042
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:34,641
I knew what he wanted and I didn't want any part of it.

2043
01:37:34,725 --> 01:37:36,435
Nicky wanted to take over.

2044
01:37:36,518 --> 01:37:41,356
He wanted to go after Gaggi,
the skim, everything and everybody.

2045
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:43,692
Plus, he had stopped asking permission from back home

2046
01:37:43,775 --> 01:37:45,068
for every little thing.

2047
01:37:45,152 --> 01:37:46,153

A casino boss and
his wife were killed.

2049
01:37:51,992 --> 01:37:53,994
The bulls questioned Nicky.

2050
01:37:54,786 --> 01:37:56,371
A dealer from The Sirocco.

2051
01:37:56,496 --> 01:37:58,040
They questioned Nicky.

2052
01:37:58,123 --> 01:38:00,792
Some stool pigeons
wound up in their car trunks.

2053
01:38:00,876 --> 01:38:02,085
They questioned Nicky.

2054
01:38:02,169 --> 01:38:03,420
A lawyer.

2055
01:38:06,214 --> 01:38:07,758
They questioned Nicky.

2056
01:38:07,841 --> 01:38:11,011
When guys who didn't pay,
their shylocks began disappearing,

2057
01:38:11,094 --> 01:38:13,889
Nicky’s name was
in those newspapers.

2058
01:38:13,972 --> 01:38:17,976
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders but they always let him go.

2059
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:19,352
There were
never any witnesses.

2060
01:38:19,436 --> 01:38:23,607
The coppers blamed me for every fucking thing that went wrong.

2061
01:38:23,690 --> 01:38:24,691
Watch yourself.

2062
01:38:24,816 --> 01:38:25,859
You're gonna get
runned over, there.

2063
01:38:25,942 --> 01:38:29,404
If a guy tripped over a banana peel,
they'd bring me in for it.

2064
01:38:29,488 --> 01:38:31,865
Come on, be nice, huh?
Be nice.

2065
01:38:31,948 --> 01:38:33,283
The bosses were no better.

2066
01:38:33,366 --> 01:38:36,161
They complained because things don't run smooth.

2067
01:38:36,244 --> 01:38:39,539
In my line of work,
things don't run so smooth. I 'm sorry.

2068
01:38:39,623 --> 01:38:41,875
I 'm dealing with
degenerate animals out here.

2069
01:38:41,958 --> 01:38:44,044
But the bosses,
what do they give a fuck?

2070
01:38:44,127 --> 01:38:46,296
They're sitting on
their asses drinking anisette,

2071
01:38:46,463 --> 01:38:48,632
but I'm the guy
in the trenches.

2072
01:38:48,715 --> 01:38:51,384
Fucking bosses think it's a fucking free lunch out here.

2073
01:38:53,011 --> 01:38:56,681
Frankie, they found
a guy's head in the desert.

2074
01:38:57,557 --> 01:38:59,476
Do you know about that?

2075
01:38:59,559 --> 01:39:01,353
Yeah, I heard.
Yeah.

2076
01:39:01,436 --> 01:39:03,396
They're making
a big deal out of it.

2077
01:39:03,522 --> 01:39:05,482
It's in all the papers.

2078
01:39:05,565 --> 01:39:07,150
What are you gonna do?

2079
01:39:07,234 --> 01:39:08,485
And I mean, that's no good.

2080
01:39:08,652 --> 01:39:09,903
I know.

2081
01:39:09,986 --> 01:39:13,698
You gotta tell him to take care of things a little better.

2082
01:39:14,741 --> 01:39:15,951
I'll tell him, Remo.

2083
01:39:16,034 --> 01:39:18,912
Fucking bosses
smoking their Di Nobilis

2084
01:39:18,995 --> 01:39:22,082
and eating trip' and fucking soffrit',
fried pigs' guts,

2085
01:39:22,165 --> 01:39:25,418
while if I want to talk private,
I gotta go to a bus stop.

2086
01:39:25,502 --> 01:39:28,672
What do they care,
long as I keep sending money back?

2087
01:39:28,755 --> 01:39:30,006
They're complaining.

2088
01:39:30,090 --> 01:39:31,591
Let them complain.
I'm the one who's here.

2089
01:39:31,716 --> 01:39:33,260
I do all the work.

2090
01:39:34,052 --> 01:39:35,679
Somebody don't like it,
fuck them.

2091
01:39:35,804 --> 01:39:37,389
It's up to you.

2092
01:39:38,390 --> 01:39:40,517
They want a fucking war?
I'm ready.

2093
01:39:40,976 --> 01:39:43,937
All I gotta do is take care of five of those guys,

2094
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:46,439
the rest will fall into place.
Believe me.

2095
01:39:46,523 --> 01:39:49,067
Peek-a-boo, you fucks, you.

2096
01:39:49,985 --> 01:39:51,695
| See you, you motherfuckers.

2097
01:39:51,778 --> 01:39:55,365
Nicky was not only bringing heat on himself but on me, too.

2098
01:39:55,448 --> 01:39:57,659
The FBI watched
every move he made

2099
01:39:57,784 --> 01:39:59,995
but he didn't care.
He just didn't care.

2100
01:40:00,078 --> 01:40:03,081
If you're gonna watch me,
I'm gonna watch them right back.

2101
01:40:03,165 --> 01:40:04,624
I spent a few bucks.
Top dollar.

2102
01:40:04,749 --> 01:40:06,209
Who gives a shit?

2103
01:40:06,293 --> 01:40:08,420
I got the latest
anti-bugging equipment

2104
01:40:08,545 --> 01:40:10,714
from the same places
that sell to the CIA.

2105
01:40:10,797 --> 01:40:13,508
I had special
police frequency radios,

2106
01:40:13,592 --> 01:40:16,595
FBI de—scramblers,
cameras that see in the dark.

2107
01:40:16,678 --> 01:40:19,306
And because ofthat,
the miserable sons of bitches

2108
01:40:19,431 --> 01:40:22,100
never caught me
doing anything.

2109
01:40:22,184 --> 01:40:25,478
I got myjob on the line and this guy's having the time of his life.

2110
01:40:25,562 --> 01:40:29,524
He has every cop in the state watching him and he’s out playing golf.

2111
01:40:29,608 --> 01:40:32,319
And at the worst
possible time for me.

2112
01:40:33,069 --> 01:40:34,571
I had my license
hearing coming up

2113
01:40:34,654 --> 01:40:36,781
and I didn't want to
leave anything to chance.

2114
01:40:38,909 --> 01:40:41,077
Ifl can't work in Vegas,
where am I gonna go?

2115
01:40:41,161 --> 01:40:42,954
You've been
very open with us.

2116
01:40:43,079 --> 01:40:44,873
I mean,
your books and papers.

2117
01:40:44,956 --> 01:40:47,125
The Commission
will appreciate that.

2118
01:40:47,209 --> 01:40:49,127
All | ask is a fair hearing.

2119
01:40:49,252 --> 01:40:51,213
This kind of honesty
will guarantee that.

2120
01:40:51,296 --> 01:40:52,714
Good.

2121
01:40:52,839 --> 01:40:54,257
All right,
we'll move on to...

2122
01:40:54,674 --> 01:40:55,675
PLANE ENGINE SPUTTERING

2123
01:40:55,884 --> 01:40:59,429
I wanted to hear
the summary about Kansas City.

2124
01:41:01,139 --> 01:41:02,557
What the fuck is this?

2125
01:41:05,060 --> 01:41:07,604
Where's this guy gonna land?
The fairway?

2126
01:41:27,749 --> 01:41:28,959
They're fucking agents,
Frankie.

2127
01:41:29,125 --> 01:41:30,377
Look at this.

2128
01:41:32,128 --> 01:41:34,130
The Feds were
watching Nicky play golf

2129
01:41:34,256 --> 01:41:36,299
for so long,
they ran out of gas.

2130
01:41:37,550 --> 01:41:40,679
Just what I needed,
right in front of the Control Board.

2131
01:41:45,558 --> 01:41:47,686
$100, whoever hits the plane.

2132
01:41:50,522 --> 01:41:52,399
If things weren't
bad enough,

2133
01:41:52,482 --> 01:41:54,818
in comes Piscano,
the Kansas City underboss.

2134
01:41:55,402 --> 01:41:58,488
He ran that grocery store where they brought the suitcases.

2135
01:41:58,571 --> 01:42:00,240
Fighting over
those suitcases again.

2136
01:42:00,365 --> 01:42:02,033
You know what that means?

2137
01:42:02,117 --> 01:42:05,537
Another trip to Vegas
and another couple of grand.

2138
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:07,247
He ran it with his
brother-in-Iaw,

2139
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:11,918
but mostly he complained
about his trips to Vegas.

2140
01:42:12,210 --> 01:42:13,545
You gotta lay down the law,

2141
01:42:13,670 --> 01:42:15,005
otherwise they're gonna
make a fool out of you.

2142
01:42:15,088 --> 01:42:17,048
| Write it all down.

2143
01:42:17,173 --> 01:42:19,175
Every fucking
nickel goes down...

2144
01:42:19,259 --> 01:42:20,927
Hey. Oh,
what's the matter with you?

2145
01:42:21,052 --> 01:42:22,762
Everything's here.

2146
01:42:22,846 --> 01:42:24,097
Since when do
you talk like that?

2147
01:42:24,222 --> 01:42:25,473
I'm sorry.

2148
01:42:25,557 --> 01:42:29,436
Screw with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his fricking head.

2149
01:42:29,519 --> 01:42:30,687
Again.

2150
01:42:30,812 --> 01:42:31,938
I didn't curse.
I said fricking head.

2151
01:42:32,022 --> 01:42:33,273
That's enough.
Sorry.

2152
01:42:33,356 --> 01:42:35,233
What happens next?
You can't believe it.

2153
01:42:35,317 --> 01:42:38,570
Who would believe that the FBI had a wire in the place

2154
01:42:38,653 --> 01:42:41,448
looking for information
about some old homicide

2155
01:42:41,531 --> 01:42:44,784
about some guy who was whacked out God knows when.

2156
01:42:44,868 --> 01:42:47,412
What's to prevent him
taking what he wants?

2157
01:42:47,495 --> 01:42:50,123
Nance brings two suitcases
from the Tangiers.

2158
01:42:50,206 --> 01:42:51,750
What about three or four?

2159
01:42:51,833 --> 01:42:53,209
We've got nobody in
the room to watch.

2160
01:42:53,335 --> 01:42:54,669
That's the law.

2161
01:42:54,753 --> 01:42:56,546
We can't even go
into the count room

2162
01:42:56,671 --> 01:42:58,465
to watch our money.
Cowboy bullshit.

2163
01:42:58,548 --> 01:43:00,300
He's got his
people in there,

2164
01:43:00,383 --> 01:43:03,595
but they could all be in on it
together, those fucks.

2165
01:43:03,845 --> 01:43:05,430
I'll find out.

2166
01:43:05,555 --> 01:43:07,140
If it's Green,
|'|| bury that bastard.

2167
01:43:07,223 --> 01:43:09,809
I never trusted him.

2168
01:43:09,893 --> 01:43:11,811
They trust that scumbag.
I don't.

2169
01:43:11,895 --> 01:43:14,481
|'|| Hit the two of
them with a fucking shovel.

2170
01:43:14,564 --> 01:43:15,690
Take it easy.

2171
01:43:15,774 --> 01:43:17,567
I'm sorry.
They're beating me left and right.

2172
01:43:17,692 --> 01:43:19,444
Ma, I'm sorry.
I'm upset.

2173
01:43:19,527 --> 01:43:21,571
I know,
but that's enough.

2174
01:43:21,738 --> 01:43:23,782
I can't take this no more.
Back and forth.

2175
01:43:23,865 --> 01:43:25,075
Take it easy.

2176
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:26,368
You'll get a heart
attack like that.

2177
01:43:26,451 --> 01:43:28,828
I'm too upset.
An end has to be put to this.

2178
01:43:28,912 --> 01:43:32,248
The damn thing is,
they hear all this stuff about Las Vegas

2179
01:43:32,332 --> 01:43:35,168
and the casinos and
suitcases and that’s it.

2180
01:43:35,251 --> 01:43:36,503
Let's start
handling things

2181
01:43:36,586 --> 01:43:39,005
ART/E ON WIRE the way I did years ago,
start kicking ass.

2182
01:43:39,172 --> 01:43:41,508
And I 'II use
a goddamn shovel.

2183
01:43:41,591 --> 01:43:43,218
E verythin g's
coming out of my pocket.

2184
01:43:43,343 --> 01:43:45,011
You are right.

2185
01:43:45,095 --> 01:43:47,931
Would you believe
it could happen?

2186
01:43:48,890 --> 01:43:50,725
ART/E ON WIRE: I'm in it to make money,
not to lose money.

2187
01:43:50,809 --> 01:43:54,354
Every FBI man across the country had their ears open now.

2188
01:43:54,437 --> 01:43:57,065
ART/E ON WIRE: If you want something done right,
gotta do it yourself.

2189
01:43:58,733 --> 01:44:02,821
Imean, Piscano,
this guy basically sunk the whole world.

2190
01:44:03,655 --> 01:44:05,990
Some are good
and some are bad.

2191
01:44:06,449 --> 01:44:09,035
Mr. Chairman,
members of the Commission,

2192
01:44:09,119 --> 01:44:11,371
Mr. Rothstein is
pleased to be here today.

2193
01:44:11,454 --> 01:44:13,957
And when the day
finally came, I was ready.

2194
01:44:14,040 --> 01:44:17,919
I felt so confident that all I had to do was present my case.

2195
01:44:18,002 --> 01:44:20,130
We have documents,
one of which

2196
01:44:20,296 --> 01:44:22,424
is a report by
retired FBI agents,

2197
01:44:22,507 --> 01:44:26,219
which completely absolves Mr.
Rothstein from any wrongdoing.

2198
01:44:26,302 --> 01:44:27,846
Counselor...

2199
01:44:27,971 --> 01:44:29,556
I want to have this marked.

2200
01:44:29,639 --> 01:44:31,766
This Commission
is prepared to act

2201
01:44:31,891 --> 01:44:34,060
on a motion
denying the application.

2202
01:44:34,144 --> 01:44:35,145
Denying?

2203
01:44:35,270 --> 01:44:36,271
Do I hear a motion seconded?

2204
01:44:36,354 --> 01:44:38,106
Mr. Chairman,
I second the motion.

2205
01:44:38,231 --> 01:44:39,941
Do I have
a vote on the motion?

2206
01:44:40,024 --> 01:44:41,401
Mr. Chairman.

2207
01:44:42,986 --> 01:44:44,487
The ayes have it.
This hearing is adjourned.

2208
01:44:44,612 --> 01:44:46,072
You're kidding.

2209
01:44:46,156 --> 01:44:48,241
What do you mean,
adjourned?

2210
01:44:48,324 --> 01:44:50,493
Mr. Chairman, Senator,
you promised me a hearing.

2211
01:44:50,577 --> 01:44:53,663
You didn't even look
at the FBI reports.

2212
01:44:53,746 --> 01:44:57,459
When you were my guest
at the Tangiers Hotel,

2213
01:44:57,542 --> 01:44:59,669
did you not promise
me a fair hearing?

2214
01:44:59,752 --> 01:45:01,004
I was never your guest.

2215
01:45:01,129 --> 01:45:02,380
You were never my guest?

2216
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:04,549
I don't comp you
about three times a month?

2217
01:45:04,632 --> 01:45:07,427
I'd like to answer that.

2218
01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:09,137
Mr. Rothstein is
being very typical.

2219
01:45:09,262 --> 01:45:10,930
He's lying.

2220
01:45:11,014 --> 01:45:12,932
The only time I
was at the Tangiers

2221
01:45:13,057 --> 01:45:14,976
was dinner with
Barney Greenstein.

2222
01:45:15,059 --> 01:45:16,352
Was I at that dinner?

2223
01:45:16,478 --> 01:45:17,729
Tell me,
was I at that dinner?

2224
01:45:17,812 --> 01:45:20,773
You were wandering.

2225
01:45:20,857 --> 01:45:22,942
You were...
You were in the building.

2226
01:45:23,026 --> 01:45:26,779
You know I was at that dinner and you swore to me

2227
01:45:26,863 --> 01:45:29,782
I would have a fair hearing,
did you not?

2228
01:45:29,866 --> 01:45:31,159
Did you not?

2229
01:45:32,535 --> 01:45:34,245
Well, tell me I was
at least at the dinner.

2230
01:45:34,370 --> 01:45:36,122
Allow me that much.

2231
01:45:36,539 --> 01:45:37,749
Give me that much at least.

2232
01:45:37,874 --> 01:45:39,125
Yes, you were.

2233
01:45:39,209 --> 01:45:42,128
Thanks for not calling me a liar,
you son of a bitch.

2234
01:45:42,212 --> 01:45:44,130
Good evening.

2235
01:45:44,214 --> 01:45:47,675
A routine licensing hearing
turned into bed/am yesterday

2236
01:45:47,759 --> 01:45:49,552
when the flamboyant
Tangiers casino executive,

2237
01:45:49,677 --> 01:45:51,429
Sam "Ace" Rothstein,

2238
01:45:51,513 --> 01:45:55,308
accused the state 's top gaming officials of corruption.

2239
01:45:55,391 --> 01:45:57,977
...at my hotel and you asked for copies of your bill

2240
01:45:58,061 --> 01:46:00,355
so you could put them
on your expense account.

2241
01:46:00,438 --> 01:46:04,817
In a wild outburst that followed his gaming license denial,

2242
01:46:04,901 --> 01:46:08,404
Rothstein followed stunned commissioners into the hallway

2243
01:46:08,488 --> 01:46:12,617
where he continued his harangue until
his own lawyers urged him to leave.

2244
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:14,661
You have a past,
I have a past

2245
01:46:14,786 --> 01:46:16,746
and my past
is no worse than yours,

2246
01:46:16,829 --> 01:46:19,290
but you guys think you have
the right to pass judgment.

2247
01:46:19,374 --> 01:46:22,919
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without a license,

2248
01:46:23,002 --> 01:46:25,213
yesterday's hearing
was to determine

2249
01:46:25,338 --> 01:46:27,507
if someone with
Rothstein's history

2250
01:46:27,590 --> 01:46:30,426
was qualified to officially hold a top gaming post.

2251
01:46:30,510 --> 01:46:31,844
Fucking hypocrites!

2252
01:46:33,263 --> 01:46:34,764
What the hell's
he gonna do now?

2253
01:46:34,889 --> 01:46:36,391
I don't know.

2254
01:46:36,849 --> 01:46:38,601
What's he doing?

2255
01:46:38,685 --> 01:46:41,396
He knows all those guys he yelled at are friends of ours.

2256
01:46:41,479 --> 01:46:43,690
What's the matter with him?

2257
01:46:43,773 --> 01:46:45,858
Maybe he could run things
with anotherjob title.

2258
01:46:45,942 --> 01:46:48,695
Wouldn't be the best
but what can we do?

2259
01:46:48,987 --> 01:46:51,114
However he runs things,
it's gotta be quiet.

2260
01:46:51,239 --> 01:46:53,366
Let him hide
upstairs in the office.

2261
01:46:53,449 --> 01:46:55,660
Say he's a janitor,
I don't give a shit.

2262
01:46:55,743 --> 01:46:58,580
But, please,
whateverjob he takes,

2263
01:46:58,705 --> 01:47:01,583
make sure
it's something quiet.

2264
01:47:09,966 --> 01:47:13,261
Ladies and gentlemen,
The Tangiers Hotel proudly presents

2265
01:47:13,344 --> 01:47:15,638
the all-new Sam
Rothstein show,

2266
01:47:15,722 --> 01:47:17,181
Aces High.

2267
01:47:20,643 --> 01:47:23,730
Tonight, taped live
from the all-new sports book,

2268
01:47:23,813 --> 01:47:26,733
we present the premiere showing of Aces High,

2269
01:47:26,816 --> 01:47:29,277
with the Sasha
Semenoff Orchestra,

2270
01:47:30,361 --> 01:47:32,989
and the Sam
Rothstein dancers!

2271
01:47:34,866 --> 01:47:37,243
Mr. Rothstein is
a professional gambler

2272
01:47:37,327 --> 01:47:39,871
and the best football handicapper in America.

2273
01:47:39,954 --> 01:47:42,332
A man who will take
you inside the real Las Vegas

2274
01:47:42,457 --> 01:47:44,834
as no one
has ever done before.

2275
01:47:45,084 --> 01:47:49,589
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
the new entertainment director of the Tangiers Hotel,

2276
01:47:49,672 --> 01:47:51,799
Mr. Sam Rothstein.

2277
01:48:00,683 --> 01:48:02,852
Welcome to
the Sam Rothstein Show.

2278
01:48:03,019 --> 01:48:05,146
We're very happy to
have you here tonight.

2279
01:48:05,229 --> 01:48:07,148
The young lady to
my left is Trudy,

2280
01:48:07,231 --> 01:48:11,277
who is a lead dancer in our fabulous show from Paris.

2281
01:48:11,361 --> 01:48:13,821
Our first guest this evening

2282
01:48:15,156 --> 01:48:16,824
is Frankie Avalon.

2283
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:24,374
Keep an eye on him.

2284
01:48:24,582 --> 01:48:25,792
I've got a large family.

2285
01:48:25,917 --> 01:48:27,126
How many kids do you have?

2286
01:48:27,210 --> 01:48:30,546
I'm very proud to say
that we have eight children.

2287
01:48:30,963 --> 01:48:32,256
Eight children.

2288
01:48:32,382 --> 01:48:33,675
No, please. Please.

2289
01:48:33,758 --> 01:48:35,093
That's amazing.

2290
01:48:35,176 --> 01:48:37,387
There's nothing to it.
It was my pleasure.

2291
01:48:37,470 --> 01:48:38,471
AUDIENCE LAUGHING

2292
01:48:38,971 --> 01:48:40,598
Ace, don't do it.

2293
01:48:40,973 --> 01:48:43,393
Oh, no, no. Oh, no.

2294
01:48:44,602 --> 01:48:46,396
Oh, Jesus.

2295
01:48:47,021 --> 01:48:48,648
He'sjuggling!

2296
01:48:48,898 --> 01:48:52,652
Let’s not take County Commissioner Pat Webb too seriously.

2297
01:48:52,819 --> 01:48:54,612
I recently
challenged him to a debate

2298
01:48:54,737 --> 01:48:56,572
on this program
and he declined.

2299
01:48:56,656 --> 01:48:58,825
What are you
worried about, Pat?

2300
01:48:58,950 --> 01:49:01,119
You don't have to
send me any questions.

2301
01:49:01,744 --> 01:49:03,871
You can ask me
anything you want.

2302
01:49:03,955 --> 01:49:06,791
What the hell is he
doing on television?

2303
01:49:06,874 --> 01:49:09,419
He's on all night
screaming about how

2304
01:49:09,585 --> 01:49:12,130
he's gonna take this
to the Supreme Court.

2305
01:49:12,213 --> 01:49:13,965
He's crazy.

2306
01:49:14,090 --> 01:49:15,842
He's going to
Washington with this?

2307
01:49:15,925 --> 01:49:17,844
He's out of his fucking mind.

2308
01:49:17,927 --> 01:49:20,346
It's a pity we
have such hypocrisy.

2309
01:49:20,430 --> 01:49:22,432
Some people do
what they want,

2310
01:49:22,557 --> 01:49:24,517
other people have to
pay through the nose.

2311
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:27,186
Andy, go see him.

2312
01:49:28,062 --> 01:49:30,648
Tell him maybe it's time
he should quit.

2313
01:49:35,945 --> 01:49:38,781
What they did was
totally unconstitutional.

2314
01:49:38,865 --> 01:49:41,868
We're on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court.

2315
01:49:41,951 --> 01:49:44,954
They don't give a fuck
about the Supreme Court.

2316
01:49:45,037 --> 01:49:47,582
They want you to walk away.

2317
01:49:47,665 --> 01:49:49,125
Walk away?
Andy, you can't be serious.

2318
01:49:49,250 --> 01:49:50,710
How can I walk away?

2319
01:49:50,793 --> 01:49:53,045
Don't you see
what's at stake?

2320
01:49:53,129 --> 01:49:56,007
The old man said maybe your friend should give in.

2321
01:49:56,090 --> 01:49:58,926
When the old man says "maybe,"
it's like a papal bull.

2322
01:49:59,010 --> 01:50:01,179
Not only should you quit,
you should run.

2323
01:50:01,262 --> 01:50:03,848
The problem is every time they mention myname,

2324
01:50:03,973 --> 01:50:06,559
they mention Nicky, too.

2325
01:50:06,642 --> 01:50:08,478
How the fuck does that help?

2326
01:50:08,978 --> 01:50:11,189
The heat he brought down
is murder.

2327
01:50:11,314 --> 01:50:13,232
The police department
was cooperative

2328
01:50:13,316 --> 01:50:14,776
but he's pissed
them off so much now

2329
01:50:14,901 --> 01:50:17,278
that nobody can
make a move anymore.

2330
01:50:17,361 --> 01:50:18,488
What are you proposing?

2331
01:50:18,571 --> 01:50:19,906
I don't know.
He doesn't listen to me.

2332
01:50:19,989 --> 01:50:23,618
Maybe he should
get lost for a while.

2333
01:50:23,701 --> 01:50:25,077
They ain't
sending Nicky nowhere.

2334
01:50:25,161 --> 01:50:28,498
It'd give
everybody time to maneuver.

2335
01:50:28,581 --> 01:50:30,583
I would forget
about the maneuver.

2336
01:50:30,708 --> 01:50:32,710
I would just get out.

2337
01:50:34,712 --> 01:50:35,713
SIGHS

2338
01:50:36,464 --> 01:50:37,965
I can't do that.

2339
01:50:38,925 --> 01:50:43,262
Of course, as soon as Andy got home,
Nicky heard about our talk.

2340
01:50:43,346 --> 01:50:46,349
Next morning,
bright and early, I get the call.

2341
01:50:47,058 --> 01:50:48,267
I've got to do some shopping.

2342
01:50:48,392 --> 01:50:49,602
You want to go?

2343
01:50:49,685 --> 01:50:52,271
But just getting a call
from Nicky wasn’t easy.

2344
01:50:52,355 --> 01:50:53,689
Even the codes didn't work.

2345
01:50:53,815 --> 01:50:55,149
So we figured
out another act.

2346
01:50:55,233 --> 01:50:56,567
If a phone's tapped,

2347
01:50:56,651 --> 01:50:59,695
the Feds can only listen in
on stuff involving crimes.

2348
01:50:59,779 --> 01:51:03,157
So on routine calls,
they have to click off after a few minutes.

2349
01:51:03,533 --> 01:51:05,827
Yeah, I got
a sprained fucking elbow.

2350
01:51:06,536 --> 01:51:07,870
Yeah.
Meet me at 3:00.

2351
01:51:07,954 --> 01:51:09,205
Caesar's?

2352
01:51:09,330 --> 01:51:10,581
100 yards down the road.

2353
01:51:11,249 --> 01:51:13,626
Why?
Don't ask questions.

2354
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:18,840
Suzy Cream Cheese
has the exact same outfit.

2355
01:51:20,424 --> 01:51:24,095
I saw something,
something very cute.

2356
01:51:25,096 --> 01:51:28,558
Okay, he's out.
It's the brown unit.

2357
01:51:28,891 --> 01:51:31,811
And he's with a bogey.
I think it's Frankie.

2358
01:51:31,894 --> 01:51:33,980
Nicky started out before me

2359
01:51:34,063 --> 01:51:36,357
because it wasn’t easy for him
to get around.

2360
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:38,401
Pulled out fast.

2361
01:51:38,818 --> 01:51:42,321
Nicky couldn ’t go for a ride without changing cars at least six times

2362
01:51:42,405 --> 01:51:44,115
before he could
shake all his tails.

2363
01:51:44,198 --> 01:51:47,869
And because ofthe planes,
he had to use underground garages.

2364
01:52:18,941 --> 01:52:21,652
Meeting in the middle of the desert always made me nervous.

2365
01:52:21,736 --> 01:52:23,863
It's a scary place.

2366
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:26,115
I knew about
the holes in the desert

2367
01:52:26,198 --> 01:52:29,243
and everywhere I looked,
there could have been a hole.

2368
01:52:31,913 --> 01:52:34,206
Normally, my prospects
of coming back alive

2369
01:52:34,290 --> 01:52:37,293
from a meeting with Nicky were 99 out of 100.

2370
01:52:38,836 --> 01:52:40,880
But this time,
when I heard him say,

2371
01:52:41,005 --> 01:52:43,090
"A couple of hundred
yards down the road,"

2372
01:52:43,549 --> 01:52:45,384
I gave myself 50-50.

2373
01:53:06,697 --> 01:53:10,826
Where the fuck you get off talking to people about me behind my back?

2374
01:53:10,910 --> 01:53:12,161
What people?

2375
01:53:12,328 --> 01:53:13,579
You think I
wasn't gonna find out?

2376
01:53:13,663 --> 01:53:15,748
What are you talking about?

2377
01:53:15,831 --> 01:53:18,376
You said I'm bringing heat
on you.

2378
01:53:18,459 --> 01:53:21,003
I gotta listen to people
because of your shit?

2379
01:53:21,087 --> 01:53:22,546
You're ordering me out?

2380
01:53:22,672 --> 01:53:24,131
You better get
your own fucking army.

2381
01:53:24,215 --> 01:53:26,258
I didn't order anybody.

2382
01:53:26,342 --> 01:53:28,928
I told Andy Stone that you had heat and that was a problem.

2383
01:53:29,011 --> 01:53:31,722
You want me to get out
of my own fucking town?

2384
01:53:31,806 --> 01:53:34,642
Let the bullshit blow over
so I can run the casino.

2385
01:53:34,725 --> 01:53:37,687
Anything goes wrong with the casino,
it's my ass. It's not yours.

2386
01:53:37,770 --> 01:53:39,563
I don't know whether you know

2387
01:53:39,647 --> 01:53:43,109
but you only have your fucking casino because of me.

2388
01:53:43,192 --> 01:53:44,735
I'm what counts out here.

2389
01:53:44,819 --> 01:53:48,906
Not your fucking country clubs or your fucking TV shows.

2390
01:53:48,990 --> 01:53:51,575
And what the fuck
are you doing on TV anyhow?

2391
01:53:51,659 --> 01:53:53,577
IgetcaHs
from home every day.

2392
01:53:53,703 --> 01:53:55,621
They think you went batshit.

2393
01:53:55,705 --> 01:53:58,457
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino.

2394
01:53:58,541 --> 01:53:59,792
Come on.

2395
01:53:59,875 --> 01:54:02,962
You could have had the food and beverage job without going on TV!

2396
01:54:03,045 --> 01:54:04,213
You wanted to go on TV.

2397
01:54:04,380 --> 01:54:05,506
Yeah, Idid.

2398
01:54:05,589 --> 01:54:08,592
That way I have a forum.
I can fight back.

2399
01:54:08,676 --> 01:54:10,177
They know
they can't fuck around with me

2400
01:54:10,302 --> 01:54:11,804
like they could
if I was an unknown.

2401
01:54:11,887 --> 01:54:13,639
You're making
a spectacle of yourself.

2402
01:54:13,723 --> 01:54:17,977
Me?
Iwouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you.

2403
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:21,147
Every time I meet somebody,
the question is do I know you?

2404
01:54:21,230 --> 01:54:22,732
Now you wanna blame
your license on me?

2405
01:54:22,857 --> 01:54:24,316
No, Nicky.

2406
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:26,902
When you asked me
ifyou could come out here,

2407
01:54:26,986 --> 01:54:31,032
what did I tell you?
Do you remember?

2408
01:54:31,115 --> 01:54:33,659
Back up a fucking minute.

2409
01:54:33,743 --> 01:54:34,910
| Asked you?

2410
01:54:34,994 --> 01:54:38,080
When the fuck did lever ask you if I could come out here?

2411
01:54:38,205 --> 01:54:39,331
You never...

2412
01:54:39,457 --> 01:54:40,624
Get this through your head,

2413
01:54:40,708 --> 01:54:42,543
you Jew motherfucker, you.

2414
01:54:42,626 --> 01:54:44,587
You only exist out here
because of me.

2415
01:54:44,754 --> 01:54:46,672
That's the only reason.

2416
01:54:46,756 --> 01:54:49,300
Without me, you personally,

2417
01:54:49,383 --> 01:54:51,761
every fucking wise guy
still around

2418
01:54:51,927 --> 01:54:54,305
will take a piece of
your fucking Jew ass.

2419
01:54:54,388 --> 01:54:55,639
Then where you gonna go?

2420
01:54:55,765 --> 01:54:57,058
You're fucking warned.

2421
01:54:57,141 --> 01:55:00,853
Don't go over my head again,
you motherfucker, you.

2422
01:55:02,813 --> 01:55:03,814
TIRES SCREECHING

2423
01:55:14,658 --> 01:55:16,577
WHIP IT PLAYING

2424
01:55:25,961 --> 01:55:28,089
Crack that whip

2425
01:55:28,798 --> 01:55:30,591
Give the past the slip

2426
01:55:30,674 --> 01:55:32,802
We got company.

2427
01:55:38,891 --> 01:55:41,102
When a problem comes along

2428
01:55:41,185 --> 01:55:43,729
You must whip it Before the cream sits out too long

2429
01:55:43,813 --> 01:55:45,481
You must whip it

2430
01:55:45,564 --> 01:55:48,234
You see that?
Dumb Jew motherfucker.

2431
01:55:48,317 --> 01:55:52,404
Grew up together and he's acting like he don't even know me.

2432
01:55:52,488 --> 01:55:54,323
I know we're supposed
to avoid each other,

2433
01:55:54,490 --> 01:55:56,325
but there's
ways to do things.

2434
01:55:56,408 --> 01:55:57,618
Fuck him.

2435
01:55:57,701 --> 01:55:58,869
To Abraham Lincoln.

2436
01:55:58,994 --> 01:56:00,162
To him.

2437
01:56:00,246 --> 01:56:02,289
Don't let it bother you.

2438
01:56:02,414 --> 01:56:04,416
Does it look like
it's bothering me?

2439
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:06,710
Why do I give a fuck?

2440
01:56:06,794 --> 01:56:08,254
Fucking Oscar, too.

2441
01:56:08,379 --> 01:56:09,839
All the fucking
money I give him. Prick.

2442
01:56:09,922 --> 01:56:11,841
He won't even look over.
What's his fucking problem?

2443
01:56:13,134 --> 01:56:15,177
Fucking Jews stick together.

2444
01:56:15,344 --> 01:56:17,429
They're having
a good time, too.

2445
01:56:17,930 --> 01:56:19,265
So are we.

2446
01:56:22,309 --> 01:56:23,310
PHONE RING/NG

2447
01:56:25,521 --> 01:56:27,523
Yeah?
Sam, we got a problem.

2448
01:56:27,731 --> 01:56:29,233
What is it?
- The little guy.

2449
01:56:29,400 --> 01:56:32,570
Nobody told him he was eighty-sixed from the joint

2450
01:56:32,653 --> 01:56:35,781
so we turned our heads and made out we didn't know who he was.

2451
01:56:35,865 --> 01:56:40,119
He's over at the 21 table
with his nose wide open.

2452
01:56:40,202 --> 01:56:41,954
He took money out
of his own kick.

2453
01:56:42,079 --> 01:56:43,831
His nose is open
for about $10, 000.

2454
01:56:43,914 --> 01:56:45,207
Now he’s really pissed.

2455
01:56:45,374 --> 01:56:46,667
Oh, no.

2456
01:56:47,001 --> 01:56:48,210
He wants a $50,000 marker.

2457
01:56:49,086 --> 01:56:50,880
Just give him $10,000.
That's it.

2458
01:56:50,963 --> 01:56:52,006
I'll be right down.

2459
01:56:52,131 --> 01:56:53,257
He'll come up with $10,000.

2460
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:54,884
$10,000? No, no, no.

2461
01:56:54,967 --> 01:56:57,511
$50,000.
I said fucking $50,000!

2462
01:56:57,595 --> 01:56:59,972
Go get it.
I don't give a fuck where.

2463
01:57:00,055 --> 01:57:03,475
Fuckers.
They take it but they don't wanna give it back.

2464
01:57:06,937 --> 01:57:09,023
How the fuck can you grin?

2465
01:57:09,148 --> 01:57:11,192
How the fuck can you grin?

2466
01:57:11,275 --> 01:57:13,360
You know how much I'm stuck?

2467
01:57:13,485 --> 01:57:15,571
You give a fuck? Do you?

2468
01:57:18,490 --> 01:57:21,994
Yeah. Give yourself a hand,
right across your fucking mouth.

2469
01:57:22,077 --> 01:57:24,330
Look at this fucking
beaut they put in now.

2470
01:57:24,413 --> 01:57:26,332
Sherbert send you
to rob me now?

2471
01:57:26,415 --> 01:57:28,542
Been fucking knocking
everybody's dick all night?

2472
01:57:28,626 --> 01:57:30,878
Been beating the customers?

2473
01:57:30,961 --> 01:57:33,631
Huh, jag-off? Hit me.

2474
01:57:36,425 --> 01:57:40,012
Take this stiff and pound it up your fucking ass.

2475
01:57:40,095 --> 01:57:41,931
Hit me again.

2476
01:57:46,060 --> 01:57:49,063
Take this one and stick it up your sister's ass.

2477
01:57:49,146 --> 01:57:50,522
Hit me again.

2478
01:57:50,606 --> 01:57:52,483
That's it.
Keep looking at him.

2479
01:57:52,566 --> 01:57:55,694
Ifyou had any heart at all,
you'd be stealing for a living.

2480
01:57:55,778 --> 01:58:00,199
Hit me again! What the fuck you keep looking at him for?
You fucking...

2481
01:58:00,282 --> 01:58:01,617
Look at this,
20 fucking paints in a row.

2482
01:58:01,742 --> 01:58:03,118
Hit me again.

2483
01:58:07,998 --> 01:58:09,667
He's here.

2484
01:58:09,792 --> 01:58:11,460
You should pay as
fast as you collect.

2485
01:58:14,755 --> 01:58:16,298
You gotta get out of here.

2486
01:58:16,382 --> 01:58:19,134
Tell this Jew motherfucker
to pay that marker off.

2487
01:58:19,218 --> 01:58:20,678
I'm here to help you.

2488
01:58:20,803 --> 01:58:22,304
You're gonna bury us both.

2489
01:58:22,388 --> 01:58:23,931
Just give me the money.

2490
01:58:24,056 --> 01:58:25,557
Give me
the fucking money, Sammy.

2491
01:58:25,641 --> 01:58:27,601
I'm gonna okay you $10,000.

2492
01:58:27,685 --> 01:58:30,062
Then you gotta get out before the cops are all over you.

2493
01:58:30,145 --> 01:58:32,064
$10,000 and that's it.

2494
01:58:36,986 --> 01:58:40,322
What are you staring at,
you bald-headed Jew prick?

2495
01:58:44,660 --> 01:58:46,620
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

2496
01:58:46,745 --> 01:58:48,706
I'm still gonna
get you, fucker.

2497
01:58:48,789 --> 01:58:50,457
Get out of here?

2498
01:58:50,582 --> 01:58:52,251
I got a marker coming. Deal.

2499
01:58:52,334 --> 01:58:53,669
Everything's changed.

2500
01:58:53,836 --> 01:58:55,170
You're talking about divorce.

2501
01:58:55,254 --> 01:58:57,172
You're asking for
alimony payments,

2502
01:58:57,298 --> 01:58:59,174
child support,
and now custody.

2503
01:58:59,258 --> 01:59:01,427
I want what any
divorced woman would get.

2504
01:59:01,510 --> 01:59:03,679
She's only sober
about two hours a day.

2505
01:59:03,762 --> 01:59:06,140
From 11:00 a.m.
till 1:00 in the afternoon.

2506
01:59:06,223 --> 01:59:08,600
If I gave her her money
and herjewels,

2507
01:59:08,726 --> 01:59:11,103
she's gonna piss
it away in a year.

2508
01:59:11,186 --> 01:59:12,980
Where would you be then?

2509
01:59:13,105 --> 01:59:14,898
Coming right back to me.
Right back to me.

2510
01:59:14,982 --> 01:59:17,818
Or finding some
other excuse to come...

2511
01:59:18,152 --> 01:59:21,113
We had a deal. Remember that?

2512
01:59:22,197 --> 01:59:24,366
He said if it didn't
work out between us,

2513
01:59:24,491 --> 01:59:26,702
I could get
my things and leave.

2514
01:59:28,287 --> 01:59:29,872
Look in my eyes.

2515
01:59:30,247 --> 01:59:31,874
Look in my eyes.

2516
01:59:33,083 --> 01:59:34,793
You know me.

2517
01:59:34,877 --> 01:59:37,338
Do you see anything
that makes you think

2518
01:59:37,421 --> 01:59:41,425
I would ever let someone in your condition take my child away from me?

2519
01:59:43,719 --> 01:59:44,970
Do you?

2520
01:59:47,097 --> 01:59:49,058
You know that won't happen.

2521
01:59:53,937 --> 01:59:55,814
And after all this time,

2522
01:59:55,898 --> 01:59:59,318
and as hard as I tried,
as much as I wanted,

2523
01:59:59,401 --> 02:00:01,236
I could never reach her.

2524
02:00:01,320 --> 02:00:03,238
I could never
make her love me.

2525
02:00:03,322 --> 02:00:05,949
I always felt she
should have gone for it,

2526
02:00:06,033 --> 02:00:07,576
all that money,
being somebody

2527
02:00:07,701 --> 02:00:09,203
for the first
time in her life,

2528
02:00:09,286 --> 02:00:11,413
a home, a kid.

2529
02:00:11,497 --> 02:00:12,748
That’s not what happened.

2530
02:00:12,873 --> 02:00:14,083
It didn't work out.

2531
02:00:14,166 --> 02:00:15,167
Everything all right?

2532
02:00:15,292 --> 02:00:16,293
What could we do?

2533
02:00:16,377 --> 02:00:18,253
After a while,
we 'd take breathers from each other.

2534
02:00:18,379 --> 02:00:20,214
Little separations.

2535
02:00:20,297 --> 02:00:22,925
At that time,
I remember Ginger took Amy

2536
02:00:23,050 --> 02:00:25,636
to Beverly Hills to
spend a week shopping.

2537
02:00:25,719 --> 02:00:27,429

Rothstein have checked out already.

Hey, little Dale Evans.

2544
02:00:40,692 --> 02:00:42,403
Yes, they both checked out.

02:01:12,558 --> 02:01:13,600
LES TER.‘ Hello.

2558
02:01:13,725 --> 02:01:14,768
Is this Lester?

2559
02:01:16,019 --> 02:01:17,104
Who's calling?

2560
02:01:17,229 --> 02:01:18,313
This is Sam Rothstein.

2561
02:01:18,397 --> 02:01:19,815
I want to talk to Ginger.
Put her on.

2562
02:01:19,982 --> 02:01:21,400
She's not here, Sam.

2563
02:01:21,483 --> 02:01:23,193
Lester,
listen to me very carefully.

2564
02:01:23,318 --> 02:01:25,070
I want to talk to Ginger.

2565
02:01:25,154 --> 02:01:26,989
I want my kid back.

2566
02:01:27,156 --> 02:01:28,991
I want her put on
a plane immediately.

2567
02:01:29,074 --> 02:01:30,826
I know she's there.
Don't fuck around.

2568
02:01:30,951 --> 02:01:32,661
Sam, I wouldn't.

2569
02:01:32,744 --> 02:01:34,913
You shouldn't do this.

2570
02:01:34,997 --> 02:01:37,166
Understand?
Put her on the fucking phone.

2571
02:01:37,332 --> 02:01:39,543
Sam, I don't know
where she is, okay?

2572
02:01:40,169 --> 02:01:41,795
SO, listen.

2573
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:43,505
Can I call you
back in a few minutes?

2574
02:01:44,339 --> 02:01:47,092
702-472- 1862.

2575
02:01:47,176 --> 02:01:48,510
1862.
I'll call you right back.

2576
02:01:48,635 --> 02:01:49,928
Right away.

2577
02:01:50,012 --> 02:01:51,722
Right back.
You got it.

2578
02:01:51,805 --> 02:01:55,851
Schmuck. All right,
I just bought us a few minutes.

2579
02:01:56,351 --> 02:01:58,854
You want to get
back at this prick?

2580
02:01:59,188 --> 02:02:02,024
Okay, you got what,
$2 million in that box?

2581
02:02:02,107 --> 02:02:03,817
Hey, you got a minute? Hey.

2582
02:02:03,942 --> 02:02:05,652
He's got $2 million
in the box, am I right?

2583
02:02:05,736 --> 02:02:07,404
Okay, you let him keep
yourjewels.

2584
02:02:07,488 --> 02:02:09,656
We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.

2585
02:02:09,740 --> 02:02:11,033
Her majesty.

2586
02:02:11,116 --> 02:02:13,702
We go to Europe.
You dye your hair.

2587
02:02:13,785 --> 02:02:15,412
I don't want to go to Europe.

2588
02:02:15,537 --> 02:02:17,164
I want to go to
see The Elephant Man.

2589
02:02:17,247 --> 02:02:20,584
We're going to Europe.
Let the adults talk.

2590
02:02:20,667 --> 02:02:22,252
You dye your hair.

2591
02:02:22,377 --> 02:02:24,004
You get plastic surgery like
we talked about.

2592
02:02:24,087 --> 02:02:26,173
How much will he pay
to get this kid back...

2593
02:02:26,256 --> 02:02:29,426
I don't want to go to Europe.
Shut your mouth.

2594
02:02:29,593 --> 02:02:30,719
You shut up.

2595
02:02:30,802 --> 02:02:32,137
You want me to come and smack your face?

2596
02:02:32,221 --> 02:02:33,722
Don't give me your shit!

2597
02:02:34,348 --> 02:02:36,975
This has always been a dream,
but now we're going.

2598
02:02:37,059 --> 02:02:38,769
Lester, he called you here.

2599
02:02:38,894 --> 02:02:40,604
Right.
That's who was on the phone.

2600
02:02:40,687 --> 02:02:41,688
Italked to him.

2601
02:02:41,813 --> 02:02:42,814
He knows where you are.

2602
02:02:42,898 --> 02:02:45,275
That means he's sending
some guys over right now.

2603
02:02:45,359 --> 02:02:47,152
It means he's
sitting by the phone,

2604
02:02:47,277 --> 02:02:49,071
like a dumbbell,
waiting for me to call.

2605
02:02:49,154 --> 02:02:52,241
He's sitting by the phone just waiting for you to call.

2606
02:02:52,324 --> 02:02:53,742
What are we gonna do?

2607
02:02:53,825 --> 02:02:56,203
He's probably got guys
outside the fucking house!

2608
02:02:56,328 --> 02:02:58,413
This is fucking bullshit!

2609
02:02:58,539 --> 02:03:00,624
Get your bag! Let's go!

2610
02:03:00,707 --> 02:03:02,584
What bullshit?
You want to talk it over?

2611
02:03:02,709 --> 02:03:04,586
Okay, you done yakking?

2612
02:03:04,670 --> 02:03:07,005
Go, go! Get in the car! Go!

2613
02:03:07,089 --> 02:03:09,091
Just relax.
Nobody's killing anybody.

2614
02:03:09,258 --> 02:03:11,260
I think he's gonna kill me.

2615
02:03:11,343 --> 02:03:13,554
Call me back here
in exactly an hour

2616
02:03:13,679 --> 02:03:15,889
on this phone.
I'll see what I can do.

2617
02:03:15,973 --> 02:03:19,393
I'm gonna call you back in an hour and you're gonna be there?

2618
02:03:19,476 --> 02:03:20,644
I'll be here.

2619
02:03:20,727 --> 02:03:25,023
Listen, don't do anything else crazy.
You all right? Okay.

2620
02:03:26,942 --> 02:03:27,901
Knock it off.

2621
02:03:28,026 --> 02:03:30,404
She started it.
I'm just standing here.

2622
02:03:30,529 --> 02:03:31,863
You're not gonna drive.

2623
02:03:31,947 --> 02:03:34,366
I'm not gonna drive
with some crazy woman.

2624
02:03:34,449 --> 02:03:35,617
You're driving me nuts!

2625
02:03:35,784 --> 02:03:36,994
Get on the passenger side!

2626
02:03:37,077 --> 02:03:39,871
I'm sending this kid to Bolivia in a fucking box!

2627
02:03:56,722 --> 02:03:57,889
Gin...

2628
02:04:03,645 --> 02:04:05,188
GO YOUR OWN WAY
PLAYING ON RADIO

2629
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:09,276
You can go your own way

2630
02:04:09,359 --> 02:04:11,903
Go your own way

2631
02:04:11,987 --> 02:04:14,406
Tell me why

2632
02:04:14,489 --> 02:04:16,199
Everything turned...

2633
02:04:16,283 --> 02:04:17,909
Ginger called me.

2634
02:04:21,121 --> 02:04:22,372
Yeah?

2635
02:04:23,206 --> 02:04:24,750
Ijust told you
she called me.

2636
02:04:24,875 --> 02:04:26,418
What'd she want?

2637
02:04:28,170 --> 02:04:30,255
She was afraid to call you.

2638
02:04:30,505 --> 02:04:32,090
She's with that
cocksucker again.

2639
02:04:32,215 --> 02:04:33,800
They got Amy.

2640
02:04:33,884 --> 02:04:37,346
She wants to come back but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.

2641
02:04:37,429 --> 02:04:38,722
They're gonna kidnap my kid.

2642
02:04:38,847 --> 02:04:40,140
What do you want?

2643
02:04:40,223 --> 02:04:42,643
I know.
Why didn't you come to me?

2644
02:04:42,726 --> 02:04:45,145
I mean, this is family.
It ain't business.

2645
02:04:45,228 --> 02:04:48,065
You make calls back home.
It makes us look bad out here.

2646
02:04:48,148 --> 02:04:49,441
You know what I mean?

2647
02:04:49,524 --> 02:04:51,693
Back and forth,
this one and that one.

2648
02:04:51,777 --> 02:04:53,153
In the meantime,
she's gone anyway.

2649
02:04:53,278 --> 02:04:54,655
Am I right?

2650
02:04:56,198 --> 02:04:58,867
What am I going to
do with this woman?

2651
02:04:59,576 --> 02:05:01,912
She's driving me
fucking crazy.

2652
02:05:01,995 --> 02:05:05,999
I think ifyou assure her that she's gonna be all right,

2653
02:05:06,083 --> 02:05:07,417
she'll come back.

2654
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:10,754
Driving me fucking crazy.

2655
02:05:10,837 --> 02:05:12,673
Once you get her here,
you think about it.

2656
02:05:12,798 --> 02:05:14,633
Wait till you
get the kid back.

2657
02:05:14,716 --> 02:05:16,218
She wants to come back.

2658
02:05:16,385 --> 02:05:17,928
That's the main thing here.

2659
02:05:18,512 --> 02:05:21,556
You want your kid, don't you?
Huh?

2660
02:05:22,432 --> 02:05:23,433
PHONE RINGS

2661
02:05:25,227 --> 02:05:26,478
Hello.

2662
02:05:26,770 --> 02:05:28,939
Hi, it's me.

2663
02:05:29,064 --> 02:05:31,233
Just who you wanted
to talk to, right?

2664
02:05:31,316 --> 02:05:34,111
Listen, I'm not gonna ask you
where you are.

2665
02:05:34,194 --> 02:05:36,238
Just, please,
putAmy on a plane,

2666
02:05:36,405 --> 02:05:38,490
any plane,
to get her here right away.

2667
02:05:38,573 --> 02:05:41,368
Please.
That's all I'm asking. Do you...

2668
02:05:41,618 --> 02:05:44,246
I mean, I don't think
she should go by herself.

2669
02:05:46,748 --> 02:05:48,291
What do you mean?

2670
02:05:48,417 --> 02:05:50,001
What I mean is...

2671
02:05:50,085 --> 02:05:52,087
Do you think if...

2672
02:05:52,254 --> 02:05:54,297
Do you think if
I came back...

2673
02:05:55,757 --> 02:05:57,926
Do you think you
could forgive me?

2674
02:05:59,094 --> 02:06:01,805
I don't know. I gotta
tell you, I don't know.

2675
02:06:01,888 --> 02:06:03,932
I understand that.

2676
02:06:05,100 --> 02:06:06,852
I know I fucked up.

2677
02:06:07,644 --> 02:06:09,771
What about the money?
Where's the box?

2678
02:06:09,855 --> 02:06:14,860
I gotta tell you, I made some mistakes,
and I spent some money.

2679
02:06:14,943 --> 02:06:16,570
What's it under?

2680
02:06:16,695 --> 02:06:18,363
Pretty serious.

2681
02:06:18,447 --> 02:06:20,490
How serious?

2682
02:06:20,615 --> 02:06:22,701
It's under $25,000.

2683
02:06:22,784 --> 02:06:24,745
Yeah.
It's under $25, 000?

2684
02:06:24,870 --> 02:06:26,538
The rest of the $2
million is still there?

2685
02:06:26,621 --> 02:06:28,373
Yeah. I got the rest.

2686
02:06:28,457 --> 02:06:30,792
Okay, no big deal.
That's okay.

2687
02:06:31,418 --> 02:06:33,128
He got his $25,000.

2688
02:06:33,712 --> 02:06:35,338
That I'll live with.
Any more, I couldn't.

2689
02:06:35,464 --> 02:06:37,090
Okay.

2690
02:06:37,174 --> 02:06:38,967
All right.
All right. Where are you?

2691
02:06:39,134 --> 02:06:40,927
I'll send a plane right away.

2692
02:06:44,514 --> 02:06:46,057
Hi, Sam.

2693
02:06:57,611 --> 02:06:58,820
So what'd you do with it?

2694
02:06:58,945 --> 02:07:00,155
With what?

2695
02:07:00,238 --> 02:07:01,490
You...

2696
02:07:02,657 --> 02:07:04,201
With the money.

2697
02:07:05,494 --> 02:07:07,370
He needed some clothes.

2698
02:07:08,371 --> 02:07:10,457
$25,000 on clothes?

2699
02:07:12,250 --> 02:07:14,169
He wanted a watch, too.

2700
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:19,341
$25,000 for
clothes and a watch?

2701
02:07:19,424 --> 02:07:20,425
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.

2702
02:07:21,551 --> 02:07:23,136
Good evening, signora.
This way.

2703
02:07:23,261 --> 02:07:24,805
Gino.

2704
02:07:24,888 --> 02:07:27,098
The good part
was I had Amy back.

2705
02:07:27,182 --> 02:07:29,351
So we went home,
had the housekeeper stay over,

2706
02:07:29,476 --> 02:07:31,603
put the kid to bed,

2707
02:07:31,686 --> 02:07:34,439
I calmed myself down
and we went to dinner.

2708
02:07:34,523 --> 02:07:38,193
I tried to keep things nice and civil,
you know, but, hey,

2709
02:07:38,610 --> 02:07:40,737
$25,000 for three suits?

2710
02:07:41,488 --> 02:07:43,365
That doesn't make much sense.

2711
02:07:43,448 --> 02:07:46,159
First of all,
he's not gonna wear $1,000 suits.

2712
02:07:47,619 --> 02:07:49,621
Let's say he did,
which he won't,

2713
02:07:49,704 --> 02:07:52,833
how you gonna get fitted
for 25 suits in three days?

2714
02:07:55,168 --> 02:07:57,003
How could you get
fitted that fast?

2715
02:07:57,128 --> 02:07:59,005
I can't
and I pay twice as much.

2716
02:07:59,881 --> 02:08:01,049
I bought him a watch, too.

2717
02:08:01,174 --> 02:08:02,384
Yeah.

2718
02:08:03,301 --> 02:08:05,136
But even ifyou bought him a really nice watch,

2719
02:08:05,262 --> 02:08:07,138
one he thought was nice...

2720
02:08:07,222 --> 02:08:09,391
He doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is.

2721
02:08:09,474 --> 02:08:10,559
Say you 9010, 12 grand...

2722
02:08:10,684 --> 02:08:11,768
Yeah.

2723
02:08:11,852 --> 02:08:14,688
At the most,
which is impossible, for him.

2724
02:08:15,522 --> 02:08:17,524
Plus, at the most,
three suits,

2725
02:08:17,649 --> 02:08:19,693
$1,000 apiece,
that still leaves what?

2726
02:08:20,569 --> 02:08:22,028
Around $10,000?

2727
02:08:22,153 --> 02:08:23,655
Would you knock it off, Sam?

2728
02:08:23,738 --> 02:08:25,448
I'm just trying
to figure it out.

2729
02:08:25,574 --> 02:08:27,325
There's nothing
to figure out.

2730
02:08:29,160 --> 02:08:31,913
I'm home.
We're working it out.

2731
02:08:32,455 --> 02:08:35,166
But I've been told before,
"We're working it out."

2732
02:08:35,250 --> 02:08:37,335
You think that you're home,

2733
02:08:37,419 --> 02:08:41,256
after what you just put me through with Amy,
as a favor to me?

2734
02:08:48,638 --> 02:08:52,100
So, counting the watch,
let's say another $4,000

2735
02:08:52,183 --> 02:08:54,436
for expenses
over the weekend,

2736
02:08:54,895 --> 02:08:56,855
of which you must
have had a good time.

2737
02:08:56,938 --> 02:08:59,441
I know he did,
that's for sure.

2738
02:08:59,691 --> 02:09:02,360
I know that fucking piece of shit had a good fucking time.

2739
02:09:04,446 --> 02:09:05,822
On my money.

2740
02:09:06,156 --> 02:09:07,949
You might as well
have fucked him,

2741
02:09:08,116 --> 02:09:09,910
which you
probably did anyway.

2742
02:09:10,994 --> 02:09:13,163
You're looking at
me a certain way.

2743
02:09:14,456 --> 02:09:16,625
You're teary-eyed, huh?

2744
02:09:17,208 --> 02:09:18,793
You're upset.

2745
02:09:18,919 --> 02:09:20,462
You're a good actress,
you know that?

2746
02:09:20,545 --> 02:09:22,547
Good fucking actress.

2747
02:09:23,757 --> 02:09:25,634
You can fucking get
that pity out of people.

2748
02:09:25,800 --> 02:09:27,719
I'm not ajohn.
You understand?

2749
02:09:27,802 --> 02:09:29,471
You always thought I was,
but I'm not.

2750
02:09:29,596 --> 02:09:31,264
And I'm not a sucker.

2751
02:09:32,557 --> 02:09:35,185
That fucking pimp cocksucker.

2752
02:09:35,268 --> 02:09:37,270
He's lucky
I didn't kill him last time.

2753
02:09:37,354 --> 02:09:39,105
Lucky he's fucking living.

2754
02:09:39,189 --> 02:09:40,565
If you'd stayed with Amy,

2755
02:09:40,649 --> 02:09:42,734
and you'd have ran away,
he would have been fucking dead.

2756
02:09:42,817 --> 02:09:45,570
Both of you. Dead. Dead.

2757
02:09:51,159 --> 02:09:53,495
WHISPERING Ican't fucking live like this.

2758
02:09:54,829 --> 02:09:57,082
No, it isn't right.
It isn't fair.

2759
02:09:57,165 --> 02:09:59,250
What do you...

2760
02:09:59,334 --> 02:10:01,336
Of course. Yes.

2761
02:10:02,837 --> 02:10:04,547
He doesn't come home
at night.

2762
02:10:04,673 --> 02:10:06,424
What is the big fucking deal?
| Go...

2763
02:10:06,508 --> 02:10:08,426
| just can't fucking take it.

2764
02:10:08,510 --> 02:10:10,178
Why should I fucking take it?

2765
02:10:10,345 --> 02:10:11,972
That wasn't the deal.

2766
02:10:12,055 --> 02:10:15,642
He acts like I'm the only one around here with a fucking past.

2767
02:10:15,725 --> 02:10:17,769
He'll never let
me live it down.

2768
02:10:17,894 --> 02:10:19,938
Well, yes, I have tried.

2769
02:10:20,021 --> 02:10:21,439
Of course I've tried.

2770
02:10:21,523 --> 02:10:23,400
What the fuck do you think
I came back here for?

2771
02:10:24,025 --> 02:10:26,569
No, I'm not.
I want to have him killed.

2772
02:10:26,903 --> 02:10:29,447
Yes, Iwant him killed.
I've fucking had it.

2773
02:10:29,531 --> 02:10:31,658
So are you with me on this?

2774
02:10:32,867 --> 02:10:35,495
You want to get rid of me?
Here I am.

2775
02:10:35,912 --> 02:10:37,872
Go ahead. Get rid of me.

2776
02:10:38,498 --> 02:10:40,000
Hello?

2777
02:10:40,125 --> 02:10:41,626
Yes, I do!

2778
02:10:41,710 --> 02:10:46,339
I fucking hate you!
I can't take it anymore!

2779
02:10:46,423 --> 02:10:47,716
Yes, Iwant to kill you!

2780
02:10:47,882 --> 02:10:49,175
I hate your fucking guts!

2781
02:10:49,259 --> 02:10:50,719
You hate my guts?

2782
02:10:50,802 --> 02:10:51,845
I'm sick of being
with you!

2783
02:10:51,970 --> 02:10:53,805
I want you to come with me now!

2784
02:10:54,681 --> 02:10:56,641
Come with me now.

2785
02:10:56,725 --> 02:10:58,560
I want you out.
I want you out of here.

2786
02:10:58,685 --> 02:11:00,478
GINGER SCREAMING
I want you out of here!

2787
02:11:01,771 --> 02:11:02,897
I want you
out of here!

2788
02:11:04,983 --> 02:11:06,818
Take your fucking bag
and get out!

2789
02:11:06,943 --> 02:11:08,778
I want my money
right now!

2790
02:11:08,862 --> 02:11:10,405
You'll get your money,
don't worry.

2791
02:11:10,572 --> 02:11:12,115
The arrangement is over.

2792
02:11:12,198 --> 02:11:13,408
No kidding!

2793
02:11:13,575 --> 02:11:14,784
And I still get my money.

2794
02:11:14,868 --> 02:11:16,411
I need some cash now!

2795
02:11:16,536 --> 02:11:18,079
You can'tjust put
me in the street!

2796
02:11:18,163 --> 02:11:19,789
You haven't been straight with me since we met!

2797
02:11:19,914 --> 02:11:21,541
You never loved me!

2798
02:11:21,624 --> 02:11:24,753
I need eyes in the back of my fucking head with you, bitch!

2799
02:11:24,836 --> 02:11:26,921
How could I love you?

2800
02:11:27,088 --> 02:11:29,174
You treat me like
I'm your fucking dog!

2801
02:11:29,257 --> 02:11:30,633
You're lower than a dog!

2802
02:11:30,759 --> 02:11:32,177
Fuck you!

2803
02:11:32,260 --> 02:11:34,721
Here! Here!
Is this enough money?

2804
02:11:34,804 --> 02:11:37,348
Will it last you two
fucking days? Take it!

2805
02:11:37,432 --> 02:11:39,642
Greedy bitch.
Take the fucking money.

2806
02:11:39,726 --> 02:11:42,020
I'm going to the bank
and getting myjewelry!

2807
02:11:42,103 --> 02:11:44,022
Good. It opens at
9:00 a.m. Be there.

2808
02:11:44,105 --> 02:11:47,192
Don't send your guys down there to stop me!
I mean it!

2809
02:11:47,275 --> 02:11:49,360
I guarantee you,
I will not stop you.

2810
02:11:49,444 --> 02:11:51,154
You don't get rid of me
with one suitcase!

2811
02:11:51,279 --> 02:11:53,031
Come back
tomorrow for the rest.

2812
02:11:53,114 --> 02:11:55,200
Get out of here.
Fine!

2813
02:11:55,533 --> 02:11:57,327
I'm taking Amy.
You're not.

2814
02:11:57,410 --> 02:11:58,828
I'm waking her up right now.

2815
02:11:58,953 --> 02:12:00,413
You're ajunkie.
Get out.

2816
02:12:00,497 --> 02:12:02,582
She's my daughter too!

2817
02:12:02,665 --> 02:12:05,877
Send my lawyers a letter,
God fucking damn you!

2818
02:12:06,461 --> 02:12:08,463
You're not
getting away with this!

2819
02:12:08,588 --> 02:12:10,548
You're not gonna
cut me out of my end!

2820
02:12:11,674 --> 02:12:12,884
Fuckeﬂ

2821
02:12:26,439 --> 02:12:28,316
CAR APPROACHING

2822
02:12:30,360 --> 02:12:31,361
CAR DOOR CLOSING

2823
02:12:32,737 --> 02:12:33,738
DOOR OPENING

2824
02:12:34,906 --> 02:12:35,907
DOOR CLOSING

2825
02:13:05,562 --> 02:13:09,274
The funny thing was,
after all that, I didn't want her to go.

2826
02:13:09,357 --> 02:13:12,026
She was the mother of my kid.
I loved her.

2827
02:13:12,110 --> 02:13:15,029
And later,
I realized I didn't want to give her the money

2828
02:13:15,113 --> 02:13:17,365
because if I did,

2829
02:13:17,699 --> 02:13:19,909
I knew I'd never
see her again.

2830
02:13:32,005 --> 02:13:34,132
Have a good day at school, okay? Okay.

2831
02:13:34,215 --> 02:13:35,633
Okay, angel.

2832
02:13:40,430 --> 02:13:44,434
From now on,
I have to know where you and Amy are at all times.

2833
02:13:46,436 --> 02:13:48,396
Here's a beeper.

2834
02:13:48,563 --> 02:13:50,732
I want you to keep it on you.

2835
02:13:51,024 --> 02:13:52,650
It's very light.

2836
02:13:52,734 --> 02:13:55,028
So I can call you
whenever I have to.

2837
02:13:58,948 --> 02:14:00,074
Okay?

2838
02:14:10,001 --> 02:14:11,961
What are you supposed to do?

2839
02:14:12,045 --> 02:14:13,421
You want to stay
the way you are?

2840
02:14:13,588 --> 02:14:14,964
You can't do that.

2841
02:14:15,048 --> 02:14:18,509
Two people don't get along,
at some point you gotta call it.

2842
02:14:18,593 --> 02:14:20,803
It's not my business,
but that's what you gotta do.

2843
02:14:20,887 --> 02:14:22,889
You're right.
I know.

2844
02:14:23,765 --> 02:14:25,308
I was just...

2845
02:14:25,433 --> 02:14:27,018
What? What?

2846
02:14:27,143 --> 02:14:29,103
Nothing.
What were you gonna say?

2847
02:14:29,187 --> 02:14:30,230
I don't...

2848
02:14:30,355 --> 02:14:31,397
Tell me what you
were gonna say.

2849
02:14:31,481 --> 02:14:33,107
Yeah.
Yeah?

2850
02:14:33,608 --> 02:14:37,195
Iwas thinking maybe
you know somebody at the bank

2851
02:14:37,278 --> 02:14:39,656
who could help me
get myjewelry out.

2852
02:14:40,156 --> 02:14:42,367
There's a lot of money
in there.

2853
02:14:42,450 --> 02:14:45,620
I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.

2854
02:14:47,288 --> 02:14:48,456
Let me think about that.

2855
02:14:48,581 --> 02:14:49,707
Okay.

2856
02:14:49,791 --> 02:14:51,459
Let me see who I got.

2857
02:14:51,626 --> 02:14:53,294
Gotta get somebody
I can trust, you know?

2858
02:14:53,378 --> 02:14:56,631
Yeah, 'cause you know he's never gonna give me myjewelry.

2859
02:14:57,590 --> 02:15:00,510
He holds that key so tight,
it's probably up his ass.

2860
02:15:02,303 --> 02:15:04,555
You're right.
That's Sammy.

2861
02:15:04,806 --> 02:15:07,350
And he's probably
got it there, too.

2862
02:15:08,810 --> 02:15:10,603
He's so fucking lucky.

2863
02:15:10,728 --> 02:15:12,480
I could have buried him.

2864
02:15:12,563 --> 02:15:15,692
I could have gone to Europe
and taken the baby.

2865
02:15:16,609 --> 02:15:19,904
Then he'd have tracked me down and he'd have killed me.

2866
02:15:19,988 --> 02:15:22,282
No, he wouldn't.
Iwould have.

2867
02:15:22,865 --> 02:15:25,243
He'd have been right.
Seﬂousw. Come on.

2868
02:15:25,326 --> 02:15:28,037
You don't take a guy's kid
and then take off.

2869
02:15:28,121 --> 02:15:29,580
I didn't.

2870
02:15:29,664 --> 02:15:32,750
I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do,
and came back.

2871
02:15:32,834 --> 02:15:36,004
You did. You're right.
You did. I like that.

2872
02:15:36,671 --> 02:15:38,047
That's what I like about you.

2873
02:15:38,172 --> 02:15:39,590
You did the right thing.

2874
02:15:39,674 --> 02:15:41,801
I did what you told me.
Yes, you did.

2875
02:15:41,884 --> 02:15:43,344
You always tell me
the right thing to do.

2876
02:15:43,469 --> 02:15:44,929
Yeah.

2877
02:15:50,810 --> 02:15:53,813
He really fucked himself up out here,
didn't he?

2878
02:15:53,896 --> 02:15:55,356
He sure did.

2879
02:15:55,481 --> 02:15:56,899
Everything went to his head.

2880
02:15:59,402 --> 02:16:00,528
Changed.
Changed.

2881
02:16:00,611 --> 02:16:02,071
He did.
He ain't the same person.

2882
02:16:02,196 --> 02:16:03,698
No, he's not.

2883
02:16:04,991 --> 02:16:06,451
He really thinks
who the fuck he is.

2884
02:16:06,576 --> 02:16:08,036
Exactly.

2885
02:16:11,789 --> 02:16:15,376
He hates me.
He hates my fucking guts.

2886
02:16:15,460 --> 02:16:16,878
Come on. You're a toughie.

2887
02:16:17,003 --> 02:16:18,421
You can take this.

2888
02:16:23,051 --> 02:16:24,344
Don't cry.

2889
02:16:24,469 --> 02:16:25,762
I'm not as tough
as you think I am.

2890
02:16:26,220 --> 02:16:27,722
Yes, you are.

2891
02:16:28,306 --> 02:16:30,224
He scares the shit out of me.

2892
02:16:30,350 --> 02:16:32,226
I never know
what he's gonna do.

2893
02:16:32,310 --> 02:16:33,686
Come on.

2894
02:16:34,062 --> 02:16:35,730
Don't be scared.

2895
02:16:35,897 --> 02:16:37,565
I need some help. I do.

2896
02:16:39,025 --> 02:16:40,735
I need some help.

2897
02:16:42,236 --> 02:16:43,946
You gotta help me.

2898
02:16:44,655 --> 02:16:46,866
I need a new sponsor, Nicky.

2899
02:16:47,909 --> 02:16:49,702
I do. I need a new sponsor.

2900
02:16:49,786 --> 02:16:50,787
Is that what you want?

2901
02:16:50,912 --> 02:16:51,913
Yeah.

2902
02:16:51,996 --> 02:16:53,664
A sponsor?
Yeah.

2903
02:16:55,541 --> 02:16:56,626
Okay.

2904
02:16:58,252 --> 02:16:59,796
Don't worry about it.

2905
02:16:59,921 --> 02:17:01,464
Nobody will fuck
with you anymore.

2906
02:17:01,589 --> 02:17:04,217
I'll take care of you.
Yes, IwiII. Take care of me.

2907
02:17:04,300 --> 02:17:05,593
It's what you want, isn't it?

2908
02:17:05,760 --> 02:17:07,011
Thank you. Yeah.

2909
02:17:07,095 --> 02:17:08,805
It's what you want?

2910
02:17:29,492 --> 02:17:31,369
You see that?
That's Ace's wife.

2911
02:17:31,452 --> 02:17:32,412
GLORY OF LOVE PLAYING

2912
02:17:32,495 --> 02:17:33,704
SINGING
Why you fool

2913
02:17:33,788 --> 02:17:36,124
You poor,
sad, worthless, foolish fool

2914
02:17:36,207 --> 02:17:37,959
Fantastic.

2915
02:17:38,209 --> 02:17:39,210
CAMERA CLICKING

2916
02:17:39,335 --> 02:17:41,546
SINGING ...for the hard years I have suffered

2917
02:17:41,629 --> 02:17:43,464
Till things broke your way

2918
02:17:43,548 --> 02:17:45,341
This is great for the boss.

2919
02:17:46,843 --> 02:17:48,803
SINGING
...that says we must part

2920
02:17:48,886 --> 02:17:52,723
I am tearing it to pieces
the way you tore up my heart

2921
02:17:52,807 --> 02:17:56,686
I smile when you kiss me
and I thrill at your touch

2922
02:17:56,769 --> 02:18:00,231
My only sin was I loved you

2923
02:18:00,314 --> 02:18:02,400
Much too much

2924
02:18:04,026 --> 02:18:06,279
CAR APPROACHING

2925
02:18:11,701 --> 02:18:12,702
DOOR CLOSING

2926
02:18:19,917 --> 02:18:21,502
You didn't answer
yourbeepeh

2927
02:18:21,627 --> 02:18:23,171
I threw it away.

2928
02:18:23,254 --> 02:18:24,714
You threw it away?

2929
02:18:24,839 --> 02:18:26,299
Look, I tried to do it.

2930
02:18:26,382 --> 02:18:28,468
I know you want me to, but...

2931
02:18:28,593 --> 02:18:30,678
Driving down the freeway,
the fucking thing's beep, beep!

2932
02:18:30,761 --> 02:18:32,638
I'm in a restaurant,
it's embarrassing.

2933
02:18:32,763 --> 02:18:34,640
I don't want to
do it anymore.

2934
02:18:35,183 --> 02:18:36,559
Where's Amy?

2935
02:18:37,477 --> 02:18:38,811
I put her to bed.

2936
02:18:38,936 --> 02:18:40,313
Oh. I got your cigarettes.

2937
02:18:43,524 --> 02:18:45,651
Oscar wants you to call him.

2938
02:18:47,320 --> 02:18:48,529
So who'd you go
to lunch with?

2939
02:18:48,696 --> 02:18:49,906
With Jennifer.

2940
02:18:49,989 --> 02:18:51,073
Where'd you go?

2941
02:18:51,199 --> 02:18:52,325
To the Riviera.

2942
02:18:54,202 --> 02:18:55,828
What'd you have?

2943
02:18:57,038 --> 02:18:58,331
I had a salad.

2944
02:18:58,456 --> 02:18:59,749
What did Jennifer have?

2945
02:19:01,459 --> 02:19:03,085
She had the same.

2946
02:19:04,295 --> 02:19:05,379
Okay.

2947
02:19:07,381 --> 02:19:08,841
I want you to call Jennifer,

2948
02:19:08,925 --> 02:19:12,053
and Iwant you to tell her to tell you what you had for lunch.

2949
02:19:12,136 --> 02:19:14,639
And I'm gonna listen
in on the other line.

2950
02:19:15,264 --> 02:19:16,807
Why do you want to do that?

2951
02:19:16,933 --> 02:19:18,476
You know why I want to do it.

2952
02:19:18,559 --> 02:19:19,810
Just do it.

2953
02:19:19,936 --> 02:19:21,229
Fine.

2954
02:19:21,562 --> 02:19:24,190
Ijust need to get
the bowl for my thing.

2955
02:19:32,573 --> 02:19:35,201
The line's busy.
There's nobody there.

2956
02:19:42,792 --> 02:19:45,002
Hello.
Hello, Jennifer. It's Sam.

2957
02:19:48,172 --> 02:19:51,217
All right. I didn't
have lunch with Jennifer.

2958
02:19:58,474 --> 02:20:00,142
Who were you with?

2959
02:20:01,102 --> 02:20:02,895
I was with somebody.

2960
02:20:03,437 --> 02:20:04,772
I know you were
with somebody.

2961
02:20:04,939 --> 02:20:06,274
Who was it?

2962
02:20:14,323 --> 02:20:17,493
| Just hope it's not someone
who I think it might be.

2963
02:20:20,121 --> 02:20:22,373
Ijust hope it's not that.

2964
02:20:25,626 --> 02:20:27,461
I knew she fucked around.

2965
02:20:27,545 --> 02:20:29,880
She did what she did,
I did what I had to do.

2966
02:20:29,964 --> 02:20:34,427
But, Jesus,
Nicky was the worst thing she could have done.

2967
02:20:35,511 --> 02:20:37,221
What if he won't stop?

2968
02:20:37,305 --> 02:20:39,432
It could get us both killed.

2969
02:20:39,807 --> 02:20:41,601
I can back him off.

2970
02:20:45,479 --> 02:20:48,441
She was very convincing
when she wanted to be.

2971
02:20:48,524 --> 02:20:50,776
This is how she
backed him off.

2972
02:20:50,860 --> 02:20:52,320
BOTH PANTING

2973
02:20:58,117 --> 02:20:59,660
Hey, Ginger,

2974
02:21:00,328 --> 02:21:02,455
don't forget,
ifyou're challenged,

2975
02:21:02,538 --> 02:21:05,041
if he asks anything,
deny everything.

2976
02:21:05,124 --> 02:21:06,667
You understand?

2977
02:21:06,792 --> 02:21:08,336
I don't want him
bringing beefs back home.

2978
02:21:08,419 --> 02:21:11,505
'Cause that could really cause a serious problem.

2979
02:21:11,589 --> 02:21:12,632
Got to be careful.

2980
02:21:12,757 --> 02:21:13,758
He's not dumb, you know?

2981
02:21:13,841 --> 02:21:15,509
You hear what I'm saying?

2982
02:21:15,593 --> 02:21:17,345
I know. You don't
have to tell me that.

2983
02:21:17,511 --> 02:21:19,305
Do you think I'm stupid?

2984
02:21:20,890 --> 02:21:23,017
Do I think you're stupid? No.

2985
02:21:23,100 --> 02:21:26,520
I think you're beautiful.
But I gotta go.

2986
02:21:28,856 --> 02:21:31,734
Nicky now had things
so fucked up on the streets

2987
02:21:31,817 --> 02:21:34,070
that every time
Marino went back home,

2988
02:21:34,195 --> 02:21:36,489
the packages got
smaller and smaller.

2989
02:21:38,824 --> 02:21:40,951
When he walked
into the place,

2990
02:21:41,035 --> 02:21:43,788
he didn't know whether he was
going to be kissed or killed.

2991
02:21:43,871 --> 02:21:46,332
Frankie,
I want to ask you something.

2992
02:21:47,041 --> 02:21:48,876
It's private.

2993
02:21:49,001 --> 02:21:50,795
But I want you to
tell me the truth.

2994
02:21:51,545 --> 02:21:53,297
Of course, Remo.

2995
02:21:53,381 --> 02:21:56,217
Iwant you to tell me
the truth, mind you.

2996
02:21:57,385 --> 02:21:59,345
| Always tell you the truth,
Remo.

2997
02:22:00,513 --> 02:22:02,807
Frankie, the little guy,

2998
02:22:02,932 --> 02:22:05,226
he wouldn't be fucking
the Jew's wife, would he?

2999
02:22:05,309 --> 02:22:08,729
Because if he is,
it's a problem.

3000
02:22:11,524 --> 02:22:12,942
What could I say?

3001
02:22:13,025 --> 02:22:14,819
I knew if gave
the wrong answer,

3002
02:22:14,902 --> 02:22:19,240
Nicky, Ginger, Ace,
all of them could have wound up getting killed.

3003
02:22:19,323 --> 02:22:21,951
There '3 one thing
about these old-timers.

3004
02:22:22,034 --> 02:22:25,204
They don't like any fucking around with the other guys' wives.

3005
02:22:25,287 --> 02:22:26,789
It's bad for business.

3006
02:22:26,872 --> 02:22:28,332
So I lied,

3007
02:22:28,416 --> 02:22:30,459
even though I knew
that by lying to Gaggi,

3008
02:22:30,584 --> 02:22:32,712
I could wind up
getting killed, too.

3009
02:22:33,379 --> 02:22:35,423
No, I ain't seen
anything like that.

3010
02:22:35,589 --> 02:22:37,633
Are you sure?

3011
02:22:38,676 --> 02:22:40,136
I'm positive.

3012
02:22:40,720 --> 02:22:44,765
Remo, things are very fucked up down there,
you know.

3013
02:22:44,849 --> 02:22:46,684
I know.
That's why I'm asking.

3014
02:22:46,767 --> 02:22:49,812
You see,
my main concern is Nicky.

3015
02:22:49,895 --> 02:22:53,691
I want to know if he's doing all right,
if he's okay.

3016
02:22:53,774 --> 02:22:55,693
He's good. He's fine.

3017
02:22:55,776 --> 02:22:59,238
I'm asking you, Frankie,
to keep an eye on Nicky.

3018
02:22:59,321 --> 02:23:00,448
Do it for me.

3019
02:23:00,573 --> 02:23:01,657
No problem.

3020
02:23:01,741 --> 02:23:04,285
I wouldn't want to be
jeopardizing anything

3021
02:23:04,452 --> 02:23:06,996
for people who
are our friends.

3022
02:23:07,496 --> 02:23:09,582
Understand?
I understand.

3023
02:23:09,665 --> 02:23:10,791
Okay.

3024
02:23:11,917 --> 02:23:13,335
Frankie, you're a good boy.

3025
02:23:13,461 --> 02:23:14,920
Thanks, Remo.

3026
02:23:15,379 --> 02:23:18,340
By now,
Nicky and his crew had already hit rock bottom.

3027
02:23:18,424 --> 02:23:21,051
Vegas really got to him.

3028
02:23:21,135 --> 02:23:23,804
The booze,
the coke, the broads.

3029
02:23:24,930 --> 02:23:26,807
I mean, he got sloppy.

3030
02:23:27,391 --> 02:23:29,268
He just wasn’t
the same Nicky anymore.

3031
02:23:29,351 --> 02:23:30,519
You must have drank too much.

3032
02:23:30,644 --> 02:23:31,854
Go fuck yourself.

3033
02:23:31,937 --> 02:23:33,898
One night he had
to belt a guy three

3034
02:23:34,023 --> 02:23:36,025
times before the guy
finally went down.

3035
02:23:36,108 --> 02:23:39,028
In the old days,
Nicky would have decked him with one shot.

3036
02:23:39,111 --> 02:23:41,322
You add this into the mix...

3037
02:23:41,864 --> 02:23:43,949
Maybe just Vegas
got to all of us.

3038
02:23:44,033 --> 02:23:46,744
His crew followed him
right over the edge.

3039
02:23:46,827 --> 02:23:49,371
They were all tuned up
half the time on coke.

3040
02:23:49,455 --> 02:23:50,956
They started
doing stupid things.

3041
02:23:51,081 --> 02:23:52,583
The worst was Blue.

3042
02:23:52,666 --> 02:23:54,001
What do you guys want?

3043
02:23:54,126 --> 02:23:55,419
Police! Stay in the car!

3044
02:23:55,503 --> 02:23:57,880
He never knew
when to keep his mouth shut.

3045
02:23:57,963 --> 02:23:59,006
COP

3046
02:23:59,173 --> 02:24:00,216
Fuck you!

3047
02:24:05,137 --> 02:24:06,388
The cops shot him.

3048
02:24:06,472 --> 02:24:09,517
They shot Blue because they thought his hero sandwich was a gun.

3049
02:24:10,935 --> 02:24:12,812
They could have been right
but who knows?

3050
02:24:12,895 --> 02:24:14,855
COP

3051
02:24:14,980 --> 02:24:16,899
Cop

3052
02:24:16,982 --> 02:24:18,901
COP

3053
02:24:19,026 --> 02:24:20,945
It's tinfoil.
It looked like a gun!

3054
02:24:21,028 --> 02:24:24,615
COP

3055
02:24:24,698 --> 02:24:26,450
You jerk-off!

3056
02:24:26,534 --> 02:24:29,995
To get even,
Nicky’s crew got stoned one night

3057
02:24:30,079 --> 02:24:33,207
and they started shooting up
the cops' houses.

3058
02:24:44,009 --> 02:24:47,012
They couldn ’t talk
in The Gold Rush anymore

3059
02:24:47,096 --> 02:24:48,806
because the Feds
put a wire in the wall.

3060
02:24:48,889 --> 02:24:52,017
When they talked outside,
they had to cover their mouths...

3061
02:24:52,101 --> 02:24:53,185
He's covering up.

3062
02:24:53,269 --> 02:24:55,104
...because the Feds
brought in lip readers.

3063
02:24:55,187 --> 02:24:58,315
Nicky found out from a teller
who owed him money.

3064
02:24:58,399 --> 02:25:01,193
He asked me again
about you and the Jew's wife.

3065
02:25:01,277 --> 02:25:03,737
Walk, walk, walk.
What'd you say?

3066
02:25:04,238 --> 02:25:07,074
He asked me again aboutyou and the Jew's wife.

3067
02:25:07,157 --> 02:25:08,909
Yeah? What'd you
tell him?

3068
02:25:09,577 --> 02:25:11,412
Itold him
I didn't know nothing.

3069
02:25:11,495 --> 02:25:15,583
Jiggs and Tony Gorilla said if you did anything,
you're fucked up.

3070
02:25:16,041 --> 02:25:19,503
You think he's going home making a beef behind my back?

3071

3418
02:40:09,768 --> 02:40:12,187
...one after the other,
like dominoes.

3419
02:40:12,270 --> 02:40:14,522
Between Piscano
complaining on the wire,

3420
02:40:14,606 --> 02:40:17,859
Nicky,
Ginger, me and my license,

3421
02:40:17,942 --> 02:40:21,696
paradise, we managed
to really fuck it all up.

3422
02:40:21,780 --> 02:40:23,448
Mom.

3423
02:40:23,573 --> 02:40:25,200
Yeah, someone's
at the fucking door.

3424
02:40:25,283 --> 02:40:27,202
FBI.
We have a search warrant.

3425
02:40:27,285 --> 02:40:30,413
I got wind of the pinches coming down,
so I took off.

3426
02:40:30,497 --> 02:40:32,540
Who needs to hang
around for that?

3427
02:40:32,624 --> 02:40:34,292
My name is Mark Casper, FBI.

3428
02:40:34,459 --> 02:40:36,169
Can I make
a fucking phone call?

3429
02:40:36,252 --> 02:40:39,214
Hold on.
Make a phone call but don't talk to us like that.

3430
02:40:39,297 --> 02:40:40,632
Everybody, out of the room.

3431
02:40:40,757 --> 02:40:42,050
Over to the alarm.

3432
02:40:42,133 --> 02:40:44,093
But they got
almost everybody else.

3433
02:40:44,177 --> 02:40:46,012
OFFICIAL

3434
02:40:46,387 --> 02:40:47,806
Get the master account list.

3435
02:40:47,889 --> 02:40:50,934
I want all papers seized,
regardless of what they are.

3436
02:40:53,812 --> 02:40:55,939
OFFICIAL

3437
02:41:01,820 --> 02:41:06,407
OFFICIAL

3438
02:41:06,491 --> 02:41:08,034
Green? Don't even ask.

3439
02:41:08,117 --> 02:41:09,160
...$30,000 of yours.

3440
02:41:09,327 --> 02:41:10,411
It wasn't valid.

3441
02:41:10,495 --> 02:41:12,247
I was being extorted.

3442
02:41:12,330 --> 02:41:13,665
I'll tell you what
you want to know.

3443
02:41:13,832 --> 02:41:15,208
I've got nothing to hide.

3444
02:41:15,291 --> 02:41:18,086
Now for the best.
I couldn't believe this shit.

3445
02:41:18,169 --> 02:41:20,421
Piscano’s expense
reports took the cake.

3446
02:41:20,505 --> 02:41:21,881
FBIAGENT

3447
02:41:21,965 --> 02:41:24,300
He might as well
have given them a blueprint.

3448
02:41:24,384 --> 02:41:27,428
Names,
addresses, dates, everything.

3449
02:41:27,512 --> 02:41:28,596
FBIAGENT

3450
02:41:28,680 --> 02:41:29,973
Thank you so much,
Mr. Piscano.

3451
02:41:30,098 --> 02:41:31,432
How considerate of you.

3452
02:41:31,516 --> 02:41:32,684
Those are my mother's books.

3453
02:41:32,851 --> 02:41:34,060
FBI AGENT

3454
02:41:34,143 --> 02:41:35,937
Fucking balloon-head.

3455
02:41:36,020 --> 02:41:37,772
What are you doing?

3456
02:41:37,897 --> 02:41:39,649
Wait!
Wait a minute! He's sick!

3457
02:41:39,732 --> 02:41:41,568
FBI AGENT

3458
02:41:41,693 --> 02:41:43,528
God!
It's his heart! Is he breathing?

3459
02:41:43,611 --> 02:41:45,864
Artie got so upset,
he had a heart attack

3460
02:41:46,030 --> 02:41:48,241
and dropped dead
in front of his wife.

3461
02:41:48,366 --> 02:41:50,493
FBI AGENT

3462
02:41:50,577 --> 02:41:52,620
He's my husband!
FBI AGENT

3463
02:41:56,666 --> 02:42:00,461
And at the end of the day,
they came to see me with the pictures.

3464
02:42:00,545 --> 02:42:03,214
FBI AGENT

3465
02:42:03,298 --> 02:42:04,799
But I didn't want
to look at them.

3466
02:42:04,883 --> 02:42:08,094
I didn't want to look at the guys who brought them either.

3467
02:42:10,471 --> 02:42:14,058
Your honor, as you can see,
my clients are elderly and infirm.

3468
02:42:14,142 --> 02:42:17,228
Any incarceration could pose a serious health risk.

3469
02:42:17,312 --> 02:42:19,355
Some of
the bosses were so old,

3470
02:42:19,480 --> 02:42:21,482
they needed doctors
at their arraignment.

3471
02:42:21,566 --> 02:42:23,735
Pre-trial services
recommends bail as set.

3472
02:42:23,902 --> 02:42:26,029
We're going to take a recess.

3473
02:42:26,112 --> 02:42:28,239
When it looked like they could get 25 years to life

3474
02:42:28,406 --> 02:42:30,533
for skimming a casino,

3475
02:42:30,617 --> 02:42:34,245
sick or no fucking sick,
people were going to get clipped.

3476
02:42:35,204 --> 02:42:39,542
The day of the arraignment,
they had this meeting in the back of the courthouse.

3477
02:42:39,626 --> 02:42:41,586
See, when something
like this happens,

3478
02:42:41,753 --> 02:42:43,713
you know how things
are gonna work out.

3479
02:42:43,796 --> 02:42:46,507
It's always better
with no witnesses.

3480
02:42:46,591 --> 02:42:48,176
So what aboutAndy?

3481
02:42:48,259 --> 02:42:51,220
He won't talk.
Stone is a good kid.

3482
02:42:51,304 --> 02:42:53,556
Stand-up guyjust
like his old man.

3483
02:42:53,640 --> 02:42:55,475
That's the way I see it.

3484
02:42:55,558 --> 02:42:58,853
I agree. He's solid.
He's a fucking Marine.

3485
02:42:59,562 --> 02:43:01,606
He's okay. He always was.

3486
02:43:02,148 --> 02:43:04,108
Remo, what do you think?

3487
02:43:05,318 --> 02:43:06,653
Look,

3488
02:43:08,237 --> 02:43:09,906
why take a chance?

3489
02:43:11,574 --> 02:43:14,035
At least, that's the way
I feel about it.

3490
02:43:14,118 --> 02:43:17,705
Call Artie.
Tell him, I don't care what.

3491
02:43:17,789 --> 02:43:21,000
He's got to be in my office Thursday morning before 11:00.

3492
02:43:21,084 --> 02:43:22,627
It's important.

3493
02:43:22,794 --> 02:43:24,379
I gotta have a conversation with that guy...

3494
02:43:32,345 --> 02:43:35,056
As much as they liked him,
he wasn’t one of us.

3495
02:43:35,139 --> 02:43:36,766
He wasn’t Italian.

3496
02:43:36,891 --> 02:43:38,476
As far as they knew,
he could have talked.

3497
02:43:38,559 --> 02:43:41,145
Otherwise,
Stoney might still be alive.

3498
02:43:45,316 --> 02:43:47,735
The first one to
skip was John Nance.

3499
02:43:47,819 --> 02:43:50,989
He found a nice, warm,
secluded place in Costa Rica.

3500
02:43:51,072 --> 02:43:52,699
He thought nobody
would find him there.

3501
02:43:52,782 --> 02:43:53,783
GUN FIRING

3502
02:44:00,248 --> 02:44:01,249
GLASS BREAKING

3503
02:44:06,421 --> 02:44:08,673
GUN FIRING

3504
02:44:14,303 --> 02:44:17,306
But then his kid got nabbed by the Feds for drugs.

3505
02:44:17,390 --> 02:44:20,435
Naturally, the bosses were afraid he'd come out of hiding

3506
02:44:20,518 --> 02:44:23,021
just to save his kid
and give them all up.

3507
02:44:27,900 --> 02:44:29,777
Where you going, jag-off?

3508
02:44:29,861 --> 02:44:30,862
BLOOD SPLATTERING

3509
02:44:31,529 --> 02:44:33,239
But, anyway,
they all had to follow.

3510
02:44:33,364 --> 02:44:35,116
Everybody went down.

3511
02:44:35,450 --> 02:44:36,701
Fuck you.

3512
02:44:42,123 --> 02:44:44,167
Before you knew it,
anybody who knew anything

3513
02:44:44,292 --> 02:44:46,377
wound up getting whacked.

3514
02:44:55,261 --> 02:44:57,680
Oh, no! No. No.

3515
02:45:02,101 --> 02:45:04,854
After Ginger took off,
she wasn’t much help to anybody.

3516
02:45:04,937 --> 02:45:08,775
She found some pimps, lowlifes,
druggies and bikers in LA.

3517
02:45:08,858 --> 02:45:10,777
In a few months,
they went through all the money

3518
02:45:10,902 --> 02:45:12,862
and all the jewels.

3519
02:45:13,613 --> 02:45:14,989
THE HOUSE OF
THE RISING SUN PLAYING

3520
02:45:15,073 --> 02:45:19,285
SINGING
To wear that ball and chain

3521
02:45:29,045 --> 02:45:34,759
Well, there is
a house in New Orleans

3522
02:45:38,346 --> 02:45:43,267
After they found her body,
I had a private doctor do another autopsy.

3523
02:45:46,687 --> 02:45:49,607
He said they gave her
a hot dose.

3524
02:45:49,690 --> 02:45:55,446
In the end, all she had left was $3,
600 in mint condition coins.

3525
02:46:16,551 --> 02:46:18,553
No matter what
the Feds or the papers

3526
02:46:18,678 --> 02:46:20,721
might have said
about my car bombing,

3527
02:46:21,848 --> 02:46:24,058
it was amateur night,
you could tell.

3528
02:46:24,142 --> 02:46:28,146
Whoever it was,
they put the dynamite under the passenger side.

3529
02:46:28,229 --> 02:46:31,774
But what they didn't know,
what nobody outside the factory knew,

3530
02:46:31,858 --> 02:46:34,068
was that that
model car was made

3531
02:46:34,193 --> 02:46:36,445
with a metal plate
under the driver’s seat.

3532
02:46:37,155 --> 02:46:39,615
It's the only thing
that saved my life.

3533
02:46:52,044 --> 02:46:54,213
The bombing was
never authorized

3534
02:46:54,338 --> 02:46:56,507
but I suspect
I know who lit the fuse.

3535
02:46:56,591 --> 02:46:57,675
Hey, Nicky.

3536
02:46:57,758 --> 02:46:59,594
And so did
the powers that be.

3537
02:46:59,677 --> 02:47:01,053
How you doing?

3538
02:47:01,137 --> 02:47:03,764
It took months for
everything to calm down.

3539
02:47:03,848 --> 02:47:06,100
But, finally,
my guys got out on bail,

3540
02:47:06,184 --> 02:47:07,935
and the bosses
wanted me to send

3541
02:47:08,060 --> 02:47:09,770
my brother
Dominick out to Vegas.

3542
02:47:09,854 --> 02:47:11,564
Always the dollars.

3543
02:47:11,689 --> 02:47:13,441
Always the fucking dollars.

3544
02:47:13,524 --> 02:47:16,819
I mean,
it was still way too hot for me to even go near Vegas.

3545
02:47:16,903 --> 02:47:19,697
So I set up a meeting with the guys way out in the sticks.

3546
02:47:19,780 --> 02:47:21,782
I didn 't want my
brother fucked around.

3547
02:47:21,866 --> 02:47:23,367
What's right is right.

3548
02:47:23,492 --> 02:47:24,952
They don't give
a fuck about...

3549
02:47:26,287 --> 02:47:28,289
Holy fucking...

3550
02:47:28,372 --> 02:47:29,957
What the fuck...

3551
02:47:30,041 --> 02:47:32,126
Come on, motherfucker!

3552
02:47:32,210 --> 02:47:36,130
Tough guy!
You and your fucking brother!

3553
02:47:36,214 --> 02:47:39,550
You fucking scumbag! No more!

3554
02:47:42,553 --> 02:47:44,388
Frankie!

3555
02:47:44,555 --> 02:47:46,390
No more! You see? Watch!

3556
02:47:49,185 --> 02:47:51,979
Frankie! You piece of shit!

3557
02:47:52,063 --> 02:47:53,731
Fuck you, you motherfucker!

3558
02:47:53,814 --> 02:47:55,524
Fucking punk, motherfucker!

3559
02:47:55,650 --> 02:47:57,401
Piece of shit!

3560
02:48:00,238 --> 02:48:02,031
NolNolNolNo!

3561
02:48:02,114 --> 02:48:04,367
Take this motherfucker out!

3562
02:48:04,951 --> 02:48:06,327
NICKY:

3563
02:48:07,078 --> 02:48:09,580
Oh, Dominick.

3564
02:48:11,832 --> 02:48:13,960
Frankie, leave the kid alone.

3565
02:48:14,085 --> 02:48:16,254
He's still breathing.
Leave him alone.

3566
02:48:17,505 --> 02:48:18,756
Frankie.

3567
02:48:21,384 --> 02:48:22,385
NICKY CRYING

3568
02:48:22,677 --> 02:48:25,263
All right. Strip him.

3569
02:48:25,930 --> 02:48:28,766
No balls.
You got no fucking balls.

3570
02:48:29,517 --> 02:48:31,644
Oh, Dominick.

3571
02:48:32,270 --> 02:48:34,021
Oh, Dominick.

3572
02:48:38,985 --> 02:48:41,195
Dominick. Dominick.

3573
02:48:42,947 --> 02:48:44,282
CRYING Dominick.

3574
02:48:47,618 --> 02:48:48,953
Dominick.

3575
02:48:53,708 --> 02:48:54,709
NICKY GRUNTS

3576
02:49:03,718 --> 02:49:05,344
Come on, come on.

3577
02:49:08,306 --> 02:49:09,265
Bury them?

3578
02:49:09,390 --> 02:49:10,349
Bury them.

3579
02:49:10,808 --> 02:49:11,809
NICKY GROANING

3580
02:49:13,561 --> 02:49:14,979
The word was out.

3581
02:49:15,146 --> 02:49:16,564
The bosses had
enough of Nicky.

3582
02:49:16,647 --> 02:49:18,190
They had enough.

3583
02:49:18,316 --> 02:49:19,900
How much were
they gonna take?

3584
02:49:19,984 --> 02:49:22,903
So they made an example of him and his brother.

3585
02:49:23,446 --> 02:49:26,490
They buried them while they were still breathing.

3586
02:49:43,341 --> 02:49:45,676
Mister, you all right?
VVatch out! Yeah.

3587
02:49:51,307 --> 02:49:52,433
Mister,
you all right?

3588
02:49:52,558 --> 02:49:53,684
Yeah.

3589
02:49:55,061 --> 02:49:57,188
They had other ideas for me.

3590
02:50:10,701 --> 02:50:12,370
You sure are lucky, mister.

3591
02:50:30,846 --> 02:50:33,265
The town will
never be the same.

3592
02:50:33,349 --> 02:50:37,228
After the Tangiers,
the big corporations took it all over.

3593
02:50:37,895 --> 02:50:40,231
Today it looks
like Disneyland.

3594
02:50:47,905 --> 02:50:49,949
While the kids play
cardboard pirates,

3595
02:50:50,032 --> 02:50:53,619
Mommy and Daddy drop house payments and junior's college money

3596
02:50:53,702 --> 02:50:55,329
on the poker slots.

3597
02:50:59,667 --> 02:51:01,377
In the old days,
dealers knew your name,

3598
02:51:01,502 --> 02:51:03,170
what you drank,
what you played.

3599
02:51:03,254 --> 02:51:05,423
Today, it's like
checking into an airport.

3600
02:51:05,506 --> 02:51:09,093
If you order room service,
you're lucky if you get it by Thursday.

3601
02:51:10,261 --> 02:51:13,681
Today it's all gone.
A whale shows up with $4 million in a suitcase

3602
02:51:13,764 --> 02:51:15,808
and some
25-year-old hotel school kid

3603
02:51:15,933 --> 02:51:18,060
is gonna want his
Social Security number.

3604
02:51:20,146 --> 02:51:22,189
After the Teamsters
got knocked out of the box,

3605
02:51:22,273 --> 02:51:25,609
the corporations tore down practically all the old casinos.

3606
02:51:26,610 --> 02:51:29,613
And where did the money come from to rebuild the pyramids?

3607
02:51:30,448 --> 02:51:31,782
Junk bonds.

3608
02:51:37,413 --> 02:51:38,956
Still not sure?

3609
02:51:39,498 --> 02:51:41,375
Probable. Maybe questionable.

3610
02:51:41,459 --> 02:51:43,878
Let me know as soon
as you can find out.

3611
02:51:45,463 --> 02:51:48,591
But in the end,
I wound up right back where I started.

3612
02:51:48,674 --> 02:51:50,551
I could still pick winners

3613
02:51:50,634 --> 02:51:54,054
and I could still make money for all kinds of people back home.

3614
02:51:54,138 --> 02:51:56,140
And why mess up a good thing?

3615
02:51:57,141 --> 02:51:58,767
And that's that.

3616
02:54:33,339 --> 02:54:35,174
STARDUST PLA YING

3617
02:54:35,257 --> 02:54:38,969
Sometimes I wonder why
I spend the lonely nights

3618
02:54:41,513 --> 02:54:43,599
Dreaming ofa song

3619
02:54:45,976 --> 02:54:49,980
The melody haunts my reverie

3620
02:54:53,692 --> 02:54:55,861
And I am once again with you

3621
02:55:00,658 --> 02:55:02,785
When our love was new

3622
02:55:04,411 --> 02:55:07,331
And each kiss an inspiration

3623
02:55:10,167 --> 02:55:12,378
Ah, but that was long ago

3624
02:55:14,421 --> 02:55:16,715
And now my consolation

3625
02:55:16,799 --> 02:55:18,967
Is in the stardust of a song

3626
02:55:23,347 --> 02:55:25,474
Beside a garden wall

3627
02:55:25,974 --> 02:55:27,976
When stars were bright

3628
02:55:28,602 --> 02:55:30,521
And you were in my arms

3629
02:55:33,148 --> 02:55:36,193
The nightingale
told his fairy tale

3630
02:55:41,323 --> 02:55:44,868
Of paradise where roses grew

3631
02:55:50,374 --> 02:55:52,251
Though I dream in vain

3632
02:55:56,630 --> 02:56:00,551
In my heart it will remain

3633
02:56:03,387 --> 02:56:05,472
My stardust melody

3634
02:56:06,849 --> 02:56:11,854
The memory of love's refrain
