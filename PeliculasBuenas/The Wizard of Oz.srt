1
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,200
She isn't coming yet, Toto.

2
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,870
Did she hurt you?

3
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,830
She tried to, didn't she?

4
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:15,290
Come on, we'll go tell Uncle Henry
and Auntie Em. Come on, Toto.

5
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,630
Aunt Em. Aunt Em.

6
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,260
Aunt Em, just listen to what
Miss Gulch did to Toto...

7
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,260
Dorothy please, we're
trying to count.

8
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,180
- But Aunt Em, she hit him...
- Don't bother us now, honey.

9
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:36,897
This old incubator's
gone bad and we're

10
00:02:36,898 --> 00:02:39,190
likely to lose a
lot of our chicks.

11
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,100
That poor little thing.

12
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,980
But Aunt Em, Miss Gulch hit Toto
right over the back with a rake

13
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,962
just because she says
he gets in her garden

14
00:02:45,963 --> 00:02:47,610
and chases her nasty
old cat every day.

15
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,950
70. Dorothy, please.

16
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,280
But he doesn't do it every day.
Just once or twice a week.

17
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:55,330
And he can't catch
her old cat anyway.

18
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,091
And now she says she's
gonna get the Sheriff...

19
00:02:58,092 --> 00:02:59,750
Dorothy, Dorothy, we're busy.

20
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,500
All right.

21
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,840
- How's she coming?
- Take it easy.

22
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,930
You got my finger.

23
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,100
Well why don't you get
your finger outta the way.

24
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,220
- There you are.
- Right on my finger.

25
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,850
Lucky thing it wasn't your head.

26
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,025
Zeke, what am I gonna
do about Miss Gulch?

27
00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:22,890
Just because Toto
chases her 'ol cat...

28
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,400
Listen honey, I got
them hogs to get in.

29
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:27,704
Now look it Dorothy, you ain't
using your head about Miss

30
00:03:27,705 --> 00:03:29,690
Gulch. You'd think you didn't
have any brains at all.

31
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,820
- I have so got brains.
- Well, why don't you use them?

32
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,990
When you come home, don't you
go by Miss Gulch's place.

33
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,233
Then Toto won't get
in her garden, and

34
00:03:37,234 --> 00:03:39,040
you won't get in no trouble, see?

35
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,120
Hunk, you just won't
listen, that's all.

36
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,590
Well, your head ain't
made of straw, you know.

37
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,930
Say, get in there before I
make a dime bank outta ya.

38
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,220
Listen kid,

39
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:00,520
are you gonna let that old Gulch
heifer try and buffalo ya?

40
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,950
She ain't nothing to be afraid of.
Have a little courage, that's all.

41
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,610
I'm not afraid of her.

42
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,083
Then the next time she squawks,

43
00:04:07,084 --> 00:04:08,650
walk up to her and
spit in her eye.

44
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,320
That's what I'd do.

45
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,280
Zeke.

46
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,410
Help. Help me, Zeke.
Get me outta here.

47
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,330
Help.

48
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,540
- Are you all right, Dorothy?
- Yes, I'm all right.

49
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:27,710
I fell in, and Zeke...

50
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,050
Why Zeke, you're just
as scared as I am.

51
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,220
What a matter, gonna let a little
'ol pig make a coward out of ya?

52
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,757
Look at you Zeke,
you're just as white...

53
00:04:36,758 --> 00:04:38,388
Here, what's all
this jabber-walking

54
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:39,747
when there's work to be done?

55
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,388
I know of 3 shiftless
farm hands that'll

56
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:42,850
be out of a job before
they know it...

57
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,154
Well, Dorothy was walking along...

58
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,400
I saw you tinkering with
that contraption Hickory.

59
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,326
Now, you and Hunk get
back to that waggon.

60
00:04:48,327 --> 00:04:49,327
All right Mrs Gale,

61
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,780
but someday they're gonna erect a
statue to me in this town, and...

62
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,610
Well, don't start
posing for it now.

63
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,200
Here. Here. Can't work on an empty
stomach. Have some crullers.

64
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,490
- Gosh, Mrs Gale.
- Just fried.

65
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,580
You see, Dorothy
toppled into the...

66
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,960
It's no place for Dorothy
around a pigsty.

67
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,465
Now, you go feed those hogs before

68
00:05:05,466 --> 00:05:06,830
they worry themselves
into anaemia.

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,340
- Yes.
- Auntie Em,

70
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,800
really, you know what Miss Gulch
said she was gonna do to Toto?

71
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,209
She said she was gonna.

72
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,630
Now, Dorothy dear,
stop imagining things.

73
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,804
You always get yourself
into a fret over

74
00:05:16,805 --> 00:05:18,760
nothing. Now you just
help us out today

75
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,680
and find yourself a place where
you won't get into any trouble.

76
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,810
Some place where there
isn't any trouble.

77
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,730
Do you suppose there
is such a place, Toto?

78
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,440
There must be.

79
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,330
It's not a place you can get
to by a boat or a train.

80
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,500
It's far, far away.

81
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,120
Behind the moon,

82
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,420

I want to see you and your
wife right away about Dorothy.

108
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,490
Dorothy? Well what
has Dorothy done?

109
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:26,491
What's she done?

110
00:08:26,492 --> 00:08:28,740
I'm all but lame from
the bite on my leg.

111
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,580
- You mean, she bit you?
- No, her dog.

112
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,460
She bit her dog?

113
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,670
No.

114
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,295
That dog's a menace to the
community. I'm taking

115
00:08:40,296 --> 00:08:42,130
him to the Sheriff and
make sure he's destroyed.

116
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,550
Destroyed. Toto?

117
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,590
You can't. You mustn't.

118
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,850
Auntie Em. Uncle Henry. You
won't let her, will ya?

119
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,850
Of course we won't.

120
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,440
Will we Em?

121
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,100
Please, Aunt Em.

122
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,730
Toto didn't mean to. He didn't
know he was doing anything wrong.

123
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,191
I'm the one that ought to
be punished. I let him go

124
00:09:00,192 --> 00:09:02,570
in her garden. You can send
me to bed without supper.

125
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,110
If you don't hand over
that dog, I'll bring

126
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:05,610
a damned suit that'll
take your whole farm.

127
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,990
There's a law that protects them
folks against dogs that bite.

128
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,790
How would it be if she keeps him
tied up? He's really gentle.

129
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,611
With gentle people, that is.

130
00:09:12,612 --> 00:09:14,660
That's for the Sheriff to decide.

131
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:17,201
Here's his order
allowing me to take him.

132
00:09:17,202 --> 00:09:19,340
Unless you wanna go
against the law.

133
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,010
Yes.

134
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,510
We can't go against the law. I'm
afraid poor Toto has to go.

135
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,140
- Now you're seeing reason.
- No.

136
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,260
Here's what I'm taking him in,
so he can't attack me again.

137
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:33,600
No, No. I won't let you take him.

138
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,335
You go away. I'll bite you myself.

139
00:09:36,336 --> 00:09:37,336
Dorothy.

140
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,279
You wicked old witch. Uncle Henry,

141
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,249
Auntie Em, don't
let 'em take Toto.

142
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,109
- Don't let her take him, please.
- I've got an order.

143
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,490
- Let me have him.
- Please stop her.

144
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,150
Put him in the basket, Henry.

145
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,360
- The idea.
- Don't, Uncle Henry.

146
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,700
Toto.

147
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,970
Almira Gulch, just because
you own half the county

148
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:08,430
doesn't mean you have the
power to run the rest of us.

149
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:11,810
For 23 years I've been dying to
tell you what I thought of you.

150
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,060
And now...

151
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,730
well, being a Christian
woman, I can't say it.

152
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,460
Toto, darling.

153
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,670
I got you back. You came back.

154
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,510
I'm so glad.

155
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:56,770
They'll be coming back
for you in a minute.

156
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,730
We've got to get away.

157
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,020
We've got to run away.

158
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,270
Well, well, well. House guests?

159
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,230
And who might you be?

160
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,110
No, no, no now, don't tell me.

161
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,110
Let's see. You're...

162
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,900
you're travelling in disguise.

163
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:51,780
No, that's not right. You're...

164
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,490
you're going on a visit.

165
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,740
No, I'm wrong. Let's
see what we...

166
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,410
You're... you're running away.

167
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,160
How did you guess?

168
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,750
Professor Marvel never
guesses, he knows.

169
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,920
Now, why are you running away?
No, no now, don't tell me.

170
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,683
They... they don't understand you

171
00:12:08,684 --> 00:12:10,470
at home. They don't
appreciate you.

172
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,760
You want to see other lands. Big
cities, big mountains, big oceans.

173
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:17,760
Why, it's just like you could
read what was inside of me.

174
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,190
Toto, that's not polite.
We haven't been asked yet.

175
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:25,190
He's perfectly welcome.

176
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,150
As one dog to another.

177
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,360
Now let's see, where were we?

178
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,536
Please Professor, why
can't we go with you

179
00:12:32,537 --> 00:12:34,410
and see all the crowned
heads of Europe?

180
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,490
Do you know any? You
mean the thing, yes.

181
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,246
Well... I never do
anything without

182
00:12:40,247 --> 00:12:42,330
consulting my crystal first.

183
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,790
Let's go inside here. We'll...
just come along, I'll show you.

184
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:51,550
That's right. Here. Sit
right down here. That's it.

185
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,720
This... this is the same genuine,
magic, authentic crystal

186
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,394
used by the Priests
of Isis and Osiris

187
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:01,770
in the days of the
Pharaohs of Egypt

188
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:04,685
in which Cleopatra
first saw the approach

189
00:13:04,686 --> 00:13:06,980
of Julius Caesar and Marc Anthony.

190
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:10,110
And so on, and so on. Now...

191
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,490
you... you'd better close your
eyes, my child, for a moment

192
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:18,830
in order to be better in
tune with the infinite.

193
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:24,370
We can't do these things without
reaching out into the infinite.

194
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,210
Yes, that's all right
now, you can open them.

195
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,420
We'll gaze into the crystal.

196
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:35,930
What's this I see? A house
with a picket fence

197
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:39,260
and a barn with a weathervane

198
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,640
of a running horse.

199
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,890
- That's our farm.
- Yes.

200
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,640
Yes. There's a... there's a woman.

201
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:51,650
She's... she's wearing a polka-dot
dress. Her face is careworn.

202
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,280
That's Aunt Em.

203
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,490
Yes. Her name is Emily.

204
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:57,910
That's right. What's she doing?

205
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,620
Well, I can't quite see.

206
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,830
Why, she's crying.
Someone has hurt her.

207
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Someone has just about
broken her heart.

208
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,210
Me?

209
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,380
Well, it's... it's someone
she loves very much.

210
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,630
Someone she's been very kind to.

211
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,050
Someone she's taken
care of in sickness.

212
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:20,510
I had the measles once, and she
stayed right by me every minute.

213
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,810
What's she doing now?

214
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,480
Yes, she's... what's this?

215
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,690
Why, she's... she's putting
her hand on her heart.

216
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,150
She's... she's dropping
down on the bed.

217
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,940
Well, that's all. The
crystal's gone dark.

218
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:39,950
You don't suppose she could
really be sick, do you?

219
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,452
I've gotta go home right away.

220
00:14:41,453 --> 00:14:43,950
But what's this? I thought you
were going along with me.

221
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,410
No, no. I have to get
to her right away.

222
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,710
Come on, Toto. Come on.

223
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:54,210
Goodbye, Professor Marvel.
And thanks a lot.

224
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:59,300
Better get under cover, Sylvester.
There's a storm's blowing up.

225
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,720
A whopper, to speak in the
vernacular of the peasantry.

226
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:06,100
Poor little kid. I hope
she gets home all right.

227
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,480
Get them horses loose.

228
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:19,780
Where's Hickory? Hickory?

229
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,820
Doggone it.

230
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,370
It's a twister. It's a twister.

231
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,000
Dorothy.

232
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,010
Dorothy.

233
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,900
Everybody in the storm cellar.

234
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,450
Henry, I can't find Dorothy.
She's out in the storm.

235
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,540
We can't look for her now.

236
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,370
Come on, get in the
cellar. Hurry up.

237
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,770
Auntie Em.

238
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,400
Auntie Em?

239
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,910
Auntie Em.

240
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,540
Auntie Em. Uncle Henry.

241
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,930
Auntie Em.

242
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,750
We must be up inside the cyclone.

243
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,750
Miss Gulch.

244
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,150
Toto...

245
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:55,070
I have a feeling we're
not in Kansas any more.

246
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,590
We must be over the rainbow.

247
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,990
Now I know we're not in Kansas.

248
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:45,870
Are you a good witch
or a bad witch?

249
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,170
Who, me?

250
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,420
Why, I'm not a witch at all.

251
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,510
I'm Dorothy Gale, from Kansas.

252
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,470
Well, is that the witch?

253
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:58,800
Who, Toto? Toto's my dog.

254
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,743
I'm a little muddled.
The Munchkins

255
00:22:00,744 --> 00:22:02,220
called me because a new witch

256
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:05,230
has just dropped a house on
the Wicked Witch of the East.

257
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,810
And there's the house,
and here you are

258
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,020
and that's all that's left of
the Wicked Witch of the East.

259
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,789
And so, what the
Munchkins want to know

260
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:17,320
is, are you a good
witch or a bad witch?

261
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:20,070
But I've already told you,
I'm not a witch at all.

262
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,030
Witches are old and ugly.

263
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,660
What was that?

264
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:29,420
The Munchkins. They're
laughing because I am a witch.

265
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,840
I'm Glinda, the
Witch of the North.

266
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,880
You are?

267
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,510
I beg your pardon.

268
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:38,930
But I've never heard of a
beautiful witch before.

269
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,550
Only bad witches are ugly.

270
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,220
The Munchkins are happy
because you freed them

271
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,212
from the Wicked Witch of the East.

272
00:22:46,213 --> 00:22:48,230
But if you please,
what are Munchkins?

273
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,190
The little people who live in
this land. It's Munchkinland

274
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,940
and you are their national
heroine, my dear.

275
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:59,150
It's all right. You may all
come out and thank her.

That was her sister, the
Wicked Witch of the East.

366
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:29,059
This is the Wicked
Witch of the West,

367
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,090
and she's worse than
the other one was.

368
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:35,090
Who killed my sister? Who
killed the Witch of the East?

369
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,720
Was it you?

370
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:40,930
No. No, it was an accident. I
didn't mean to kill anybody.

371
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,520
Well, my little pretty, I
can cause accidents too.

372
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:47,015
Aren't you forgetting
the ruby slippers?

373
00:29:47,016 --> 00:29:48,150
The slippers, yes.

374
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,110
The slippers.

375
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,870
They're gone.

376
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,490
The ruby slippers. What
have you done with them?

377
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,370
Give them back to me or I'll...

378
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:07,080
It's too late. There they
are, and there they'll stay.

379
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,762
Give me back my slippers. I'm the

380
00:30:12,763 --> 00:30:14,550
only one that knows
how to use them.

381
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,260
They're of no use to you. Give
them back to me. Give them back.

382
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:21,300
Keep tight inside of them. Their
magic must be very powerful

383
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,430
or she wouldn't
want them so badly.

384
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,060
Stay out of this, Glinda,
or I'll fix you as well.

385
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,440
Rubbish. You have no power here.

386
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:31,730
Begone, before somebody
drops a house on you too.

387
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,860
Very well. I'll bide my time.

388
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,397
And as for you, my
fine lady, it's true I

389
00:30:37,398 --> 00:30:39,990
can't attend to you here
and now as I'd like.

390
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,580
But just try to
stay out of my way.

391
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,870
Just try.

392
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,950
I'll get you, my pretty

393
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,370
and your little dog too.

394
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,510
It's all right. You can
get up. She's gone.

395
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:05,930
It's all right. You
can all get up.

396
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,770
What a smell of sulphur.

397
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:11,190
I'm afraid you've made an
enemy of the Wicked Witch.

398
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,715
The sooner you get out
of Oz altogether,

399
00:31:13,716 --> 00:31:15,610
the safer you'll sleep, my dear.

400
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,900
Oh, I'd give anything to
get out of Oz altogether.

401
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:23,120
But which is the way back to
Kansas? I can't go the way I came.

402
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,330
No, that's true. The only
person who might know

403
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,120
would be the great and wonderful
Wizard of Oz himself.

404
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:33,380
The Wizard of Oz? Is he
good or is he wicked?

405
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:36,090
Very good, but very mysterious.

406
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:39,130
He lives in the Emerald City,
a long journey from here.

407
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,970
Did you bring your
broomstick with you?

408
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:45,810
- No, I'm afraid I didn't.
- Well then, you'll have to walk.

409
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:49,350
The Munchkins will see you safely
to the border of Munchkinland.

410
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,656
And remember, never let those ruby

411
00:31:51,657 --> 00:31:53,980
slippers off your
feet for a moment

412
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:57,980
or you will be at the mercy of
the Wicked Witch of the West.

413
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,280
But how do I start
for Emerald City?

414
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,530
It's always best to
start at the beginning.

415
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:07,950
And all you do is follow
the Yellow Brick Road.

416
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:19,020
But what happens if I...

417
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:21,840
Just follow the Yellow Brick Road.

418
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,550
Goodbye.

419
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,480
My.

420
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:42,450

Follow the Yellow...?

440
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,660
Now which way do we go?

441
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:09,950
Pardon me. That way
is a very nice way.

442
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,000
Who said that?

443
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,710
Don't be silly, Toto.

444
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:23,460
- Scarecrows don't talk.
- It's pleasant down that way too.

445
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,510
That's funny. Wasn't he
pointing the other way?

446
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:32,100
Of course, people do go both ways.

447
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:39,100
Why, you did say
something, didn't you?

448
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,360
Are you doing that on purpose,
or can't you make up your mind?

449
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:49,490
That's the trouble. I
can't make up my mind.

450
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,410
I haven't got a brain.

451
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,620
Only straw.

452
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:56,450
How can you talk if you
haven't got a brain?

453
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,210
I don't know.

454
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:00,350
But some people
without brains do an

455
00:35:00,351 --> 00:35:02,170
awful lot of talking, don't they?

456
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,090
Yes, I guess you're right.

457
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,220
Well, we haven't really
met properly, have we?

458
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,340
Why, no.

459
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:14,260
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

460
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:17,640
- Very well, thank you.
- I'm not feeling at all well.

461
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:20,252
You see, it's very
tedious being stuck up

462
00:35:20,253 --> 00:35:22,810
here all day long with
a pole up your back.

463
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:27,110
Oh dear, that must be terribly
uncomfortable. Can't you get down?

464
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,820
Down? No, you see,
I'm... well I'm...

465
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:32,070
Well, here, let me help you.

466
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,240
Oh, that's very kind
of you. Very kind.

467
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,500
Oh dear, I don't quite
see, how I can...

468
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,250
Of course, I'm not bright
about doing things,

469
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,623
but if you'll just
bend the nail down in

470
00:35:44,624 --> 00:35:46,880
the back, maybe I'll
slip off and come...

471
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,970
Yes.

472
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,470
- There goes some of me again.
- Does it hurt you?

473
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,890
No, I just keep picking it up
and putting it back in again.

474
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,190
My. It's good to be free.

475
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,730
Did I scare ya?

476
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,190
No, no, I just thought
you hurt yourself.

477
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,450
- But I didn't scare ya?
- No, of course not.

478
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,160
I didn't think so.

479
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:14,870
Boo. Scat. Boo.

480
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:21,500
You see? I can't
even scare a crow.

481
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:23,796
They come from miles
around just to

482
00:36:23,797 --> 00:36:26,040
eat in my field and
laugh in my face.

483
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:29,710
I'm a failure, because
I haven't got a brain.

484
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:33,010
Well, what would you do with
a brain if you had one?

485
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,260

00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,383
I wanna get back
there so badly, I'm

510
00:37:50,384 --> 00:37:51,800
going all the way to Emerald City

511
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,050
to get the Wizard
of Oz to help me.

512
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,630
You're going to see a wizard?

513
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:00,470
Do you think if I went with you,
this wizard would give me brains?

514
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,520
I couldn't say.

515
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,690
But even if he didn't, you'd be
no worse off than you are now.

516
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:09,360
- Yes, that's true.
- But maybe you better not.

517
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,030
I've got a witch mad at me, and
you might get into trouble.

518
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:17,280
Witch? I'm not afraid of a witch.
I'm not afraid of anything.

519
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:22,040
- Except a lighted match.
- I don't blame you for that.

520
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,238
But I'd face a whole
box full of them

521
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:26,330
for the chance of
getting some brains.

522
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:30,960
Look, I won't be any trouble,
because I don't eat a thing.

523
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:35,010
And I won't try to manage
things, because I can't think.

524
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,590
Won't you take me with you?

525
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,010
Why, of course I will.

526
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,640
Hooray. We're off to see a wizard.

527
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:45,230
You're not starting out very well.

528
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,520
I'll try. Really, I will.

529
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:48,900
- To Oz?
- To Oz.

Look.

539
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,070
What do you think you're doing?

540
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:47,620
We've been walking a long
ways and I was hungry and...

541
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,370
Did you say something?

542
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,540
- She was hungry.
- She was hungry.

543
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,730
Well... how would
like to have someone

544
00:39:53,731 --> 00:39:55,750
come along and pick
something off you?

545
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,260
Dear. I keep forgetting
I'm not in Kansas.

546
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:01,970
Come along, Dorothy.

547
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,430
You don't want any
of those apples.

548
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,720
Are you hinting my apples
aren't what they ought to be?

549
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:10,640
No. It's just that she doesn't
like little green worms.

550
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:11,980
You.

551
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:19,070
I'll show you how to get apples.

552
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:29,290
Hooray. I guess that
did it. Help yourself.

553
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:56,360
Why, it's a man.

554
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:59,940
A man made out of tin.

555
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,110
Yes.

556
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:04,490
Look.

557
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,990
Did you say something?

558
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,000
He said "oil can."

559
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:17,840
- Oil can what?
- Oil can?

560
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,170
Here it is.

561
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:23,840
Where do you want
to be oiled first?

562
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,720
He said his mouth.

563
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:33,020
The other side.

564
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,320
My goodness. I can talk again.

565
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:50,280
Oil my arms, please.
Oil my elbows.

566
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:51,870
Here.

567
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:58,790
- Did that hurt?
- No, it feels wonderful.

568
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,340
I've held that axe up for ages.

569
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:06,180
Goodness. How did you
ever get like this?

570
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,850
Well, about a year ago

571
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:10,810
I was chopping that tree

572
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,850
when suddenly it began to rain.

573
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:17,020
And right in the middle of
a chop, I rusted solid.

574
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:19,900
And I've been that way ever since.

575
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:24,610
Well, you're perfect now.

576
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,700
My neck. My neck.

577
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,240
Perfect?

578
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:31,240
Bang on my chest if you
think I'm perfect.

579
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:33,700
Go ahead, bang on it.

580
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:38,370
Beautiful. What an echo.

581
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,460
It's empty.

582
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:44,460
The tinsmith forgot
to give me a heart.

583
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,670
- No heart?
- No heart?

584
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,510
No heart.

585
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,930

I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.

607
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,640
Dear.

608
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,100
That was wonderful.

609
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:43,390
You know, we were just wondering
why you couldn't come with us

610
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,690
to the Emerald City to ask the
Wizard of Oz for a heart.

611
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:49,730
Oh, suppose the Wizard wouldn't
give me one when we got there.

612
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,440
But he will.

613
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:52,990
He must.

614
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:55,660
We've come such a
long way already.

615
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:05,870
You call that long?
Why, you've just begun.

616
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,540
Helping the little lady along,
are you, my fine gentlemen?

617
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:11,960
Well, stay away from her

618
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:14,220
or I'll stuff a mattress with you.

619
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:16,590
And you.

620
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,550
I'll use you for a beehive.

621
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:23,140
Here, scarecrow. Wanna play ball?

622
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:30,310
Fire. I'm burning. I'm burning.

623
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,870
I'm not afraid of her.

624
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,950
I'll see you get
safely to the Wizard

625
00:46:45,951 --> 00:46:47,710
now, whether I get a brain or not.

626
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:49,210
Stuff a mattress with me.

627
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:54,210
I'll see you reach the Wizard,
whether I get a heart or not.

628
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:56,170
Beehive. Blah.

629
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:59,680
Let her try and make
a beehive out of me.

630
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:04,930
You're the best friends
anybody ever had.

631
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:09,520
And it's funny, but I feel as
if I've known you all the time.

632
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:12,860
- But I couldn't have, could I?
- I don't see how.

633
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,919
You weren't around
when I was stuffed

634
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,360
and sewn together, were you?

635
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:20,280
And I was standing over there
rusting for the longest time.

636
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:23,160
Still, I wish I could remember.

637
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:25,663
But I guess it doesn't
matter anyway.

638
00:47:25,664 --> 00:47:27,750
We know each other now, don't we?

639
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,080
- That's right.
- We do.

640
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:32,000

Of course, I don't
know, but I think

it'll get darker before
it gets lighter.

Which one of you first?

666
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,920
I'll fight you both
together, if you want.

667
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,340
I'll fight you with one
paw tied behind my back.

668
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:40,710
I'll fight you
standing on one foot.

669
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,380
I'll fight you with
my eyes closed.

670
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:46,680
Pulling an axe on me?

671
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:51,100
Sneaking up on me? Why...

672
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,935
Here, here. Go away
and let us alone.

673
00:49:54,936 --> 00:49:55,936
Scared, huh?

674
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:57,400
Afraid, huh?

675
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:59,770
How long can you stay
fresh in that can?

676
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:06,200
Come on, get up and fight,
you shivering junk yard.

677
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:09,330
Put your hands up, you
lopsided bag of hay.

678
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:11,080
Now, that's getting
personal, Lion.

679
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:14,160
Yes, get up and
teach him a lesson.

680
00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:16,750
What's wrong with
you teaching him?

681
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,880
Well, I hardly know him.

682
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,670
Well, I'll get you anyway, peewee.

683
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:34,270
Shame on you.

684
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,560
What did you do that
for? I didn't bite him.

685
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:40,650
No, but you tried to.

686
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:42,754
It's bad enough picking
on a straw man, but when

687
00:50:42,755 --> 00:50:44,530
you go around picking
on poor little dogs...

688
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:48,320
Well, you didn't have to
go and hit me, did ya?

689
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:50,660
Is my nose bleeding?

690
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:53,240
Well, of course not.

691
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:57,120
My goodness, what a
fuss you're making.

692
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:59,319
Well, naturally,
when you go around

693
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,630
picking on things
weaker than you are...

694
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,550
Why, you're nothing but
a great big coward.

695
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:06,170
You're right, I am a coward.

696
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,720
I haven't any courage at all.

697
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:12,640
I even scare myself.

698
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:15,600
Look at the circles under my eyes.

699
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:17,560
I haven't slept in weeks.

700
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:19,690
Why don't you try counting sheep?

701
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:23,520
That doesn't do any good.
I'm afraid of 'em.

702
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,650
That's too bad.

703
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:29,530
Don't you think the Wizard
could help him too?

704
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,780
I don't see why not.

705
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:33,330
Why don't you come along with us.

706
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:36,410
We're on our way to see the
Wizard now. To get him a heart.

707
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,500
And him a brain.

708
00:51:37,501 --> 00:51:39,750
I'm sure he could give
you some courage.

709
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:43,019
Wouldn't you feel
degraded to be seen

710
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,340
in the company of a cowardly lion?

711
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:47,050
I would.

712
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:49,510
No, of course not.

713
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:53,640
Gee, that's awfully nice of you.

714
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:57,470
My life has been
simply unbearable.

715
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,690
Well, it's all right now.

716
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:02,190
The Wizard will fix everything.

717
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:05,190
It's been in me so long.

718
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,690
I just gotta tell you how I feel.

719
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,700
Well, come on.

All the worse for you.

741
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:32,150
I'll take care of you
now, instead of later.

742
00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:37,240
When I gain those ruby slippers

743
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:40,790
my power will be the
greatest in Oz.

744
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,960
And now, my beauties

745
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,330
something with poison
in it, I think.

746
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,670
With poison in it.

747
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:55,430
But attractive to the eye
and soothing to the smell.

748
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:58,640
Poppies.

749
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:01,100
Poppies.

750
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:04,690
Poppies will put them to sleep.

751
00:54:04,850 --> 00:54:06,980
Sleep...

752
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:10,940
Now they'll sleep.

753
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,390
There's Emerald City.

754
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:45,230
We're almost there.
At last. At last.

755
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:49,440
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Just like I knew it would be.

756
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:51,020
He really must be a wonderful

757
00:54:51,021 --> 00:54:52,820
Wizard to live in
a city like that.

758
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:54,990
Come on, what are we waiting for?

759
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:58,280
- Nothing. Let's hurry.
- Yes, let's run.

760
00:55:02,870 --> 00:55:05,160
- Come on. Come on.
- Hurry. Hurry.

761
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:10,960
Look.

762
00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:13,300
Come on. Come on.

763
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:15,670
Look at the scenery.
It's wonderful.

764
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,380
Emerald City.

765
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,600
What's happening?

766
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:26,520
What is it?

767
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:28,850
I can't run any more.

768
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:30,020
I'm so sleepy.

769
00:55:30,021 --> 00:55:32,270
Here, give us your hand
and we'll pull you along.

770
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:35,900
No, please. I have to
rest for just a minute.

771
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:38,610
Toto. Where's Toto?

772
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:41,240
You can't rest now.
We're nearly there.

773
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,910
Don't cry. You'll
rust yourself again.

774
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:50,000
Come to think of it, 40
winks wouldn't be bad.

775
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:52,830
- Don't you start it too.
- No.

776
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,590
We ought to try and carry Dorothy.

777
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:56,800
I don't think I could,
but we could try.

778
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:58,920
- Let's.
- Yes.

779
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:02,066
Now look at him. This is terrible.

780
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,890
Here, Tin Man, help me.

781
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:08,680
This is terrible. I can't
budge her an inch.

782
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:10,480
This is a spell, this is.

783
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:13,610
It's the Wicked
Witch. What'll we do?

784
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:16,230
Help. Help.

785
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,570
It's no use screaming
at a time like this.

786
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:21,700
Nobody will hear you. Help. Help.

787
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:23,910
Help.

788
00:56:27,750 --> 00:56:29,200
It's snowing.

789
00:56:30,750 --> 00:56:33,040
No, it isn't.

790
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,790
Yes, it is.

791
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:37,800
Maybe that'll help.

792
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,920
But it couldn't help.

793
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:45,930
It does help. Dorothy,
you're waking up.

794
00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:55,020
Unusual weather we're
having, ain't it?

795
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:58,820
Look. He's rusted again.

796
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:02,570
- Give me the oilcan, quick.
- Here.

797
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:04,740
- He is rusted.
- Here.

798
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:08,620
- Here.
- Quick.

799
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:10,330
Curses. Curses.

800
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,790
Somebody always helps that girl.

801
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:18,710
But shoes or no shoes, I'm still
great enough to conquer her.

802
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,460
And woe to those who
try to stop me.

803
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:23,090
Come on, let's get outta here.

804
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:25,590

- We did.
- Can't you read?

822
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:34,160
- Read what?
- The notice.

823
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:36,210
- What notice?
- It's on the door.

824
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:39,840
As plain as the nose on my face.

825
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:52,390
"Bell out of order. Please knock."

826
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:56,350
Well. That's more like it.

827
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,350
Now, state your business.

828
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:01,150
We wanna see the Wizard.

829
00:59:02,230 --> 00:59:03,980
The Wizard?

830
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:06,740
But nobody can see the great Oz.

831
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:11,120
Nobody's ever seen the great
Oz. Even I've never seen him.

832
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,790
Well then, how do you
know there is one?

833
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:15,950
Because he's...

834
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:19,710
You're wasting my time.

835
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:23,880
Please. Please, sir. I've
got to see the Wizard.

836
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:26,578
The Good Witch of
the North sent me.

837
00:59:26,579 --> 00:59:27,579
Prove it.

838
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:30,840
She's wearing the ruby
slippers that she gave her.

839
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:39,020
So she is. Well, bust my buttons.

840
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:41,650
Why didn't you say that
in the first place?

841
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:44,070
That's a horse of a
different colour.

842
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:46,740
Come on in.

843
00:59:57,830 --> 00:59:59,330
Cabby. Cabby.

844
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,377
Just what you're looking for. Take

845
01:00:01,378 --> 01:00:03,420
you any place in
the city, we does.

846
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:06,275
Would you take us
to see the Wizard?

847
01:00:06,276 --> 01:00:08,670
The Wizard? The Wizard? I can't...

848
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:13,090
Yes, of course. But first I'll
take you to a little place

849
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:15,710
where you can tidy up a bit, what?

850
01:00:15,711 --> 01:00:17,100
Thank you so much.

851
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:22,020
We've been gone such a long
time, and we feel so mess...

852
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,367
What kind of a horse is that? I've

853
01:00:24,368 --> 01:00:26,610
never seen a horse
like that before.

854
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:28,624
No, and never will again, I fancy.

855
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,740
There's only one of
him, and he's it.

856
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:34,700
He's the horse of a different
colour you've heard tell about.

It's the witch. She's

"Surrender, Dorothy."

893
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:38,700
Dorothy? Who's Dorothy?

894
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:41,620
- The Wizard will explain it.
- To the Wizard.

895
01:02:41,830 --> 01:02:44,040
Dear. Whatever shall we do?

896
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:47,000
We better hurry if we're
gonna see the Wizard.

897
01:02:48,790 --> 01:02:52,250
Here. Here, here.
Everything is all right.

898
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:54,260
Stop that now, just...

899
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:56,930
It's all right.
Everything is all right.

900
01:02:57,090 --> 01:03:01,550
The great and powerful Oz has
got matters well in hand.

901
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,060
I hope.

902
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:06,560
So you can all go home. And
there's nothing to worry about.

903
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:10,150
Get outta here. Now
go on. Go on home.

904
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,190
Go home.

905
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,599
If you please sir,
we wanna see the

906
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,110
Wizard right away, all 4 of us.

907
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:20,990
Orders are, nobody can see the
great Oz. Not nobody. Not no how.

908
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:23,740
But... but please,
it's very important.

909
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:26,120
I got a permanent just
for the occasion.

910
01:03:26,290 --> 01:03:28,870
Not nobody. Not no how.

911
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,460
But she's Dorothy.

912
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:33,710
The Witch's Dorothy?

913
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,670
Well, that makes a difference.

914
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:41,930
Just wait here. I'll
announce you at once.

915
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:48,140
Did you hear that? He'll
announce us at once.

916
01:03:48,310 --> 01:03:49,732
I've as good as got my brain.

917
01:03:49,733 --> 01:03:51,520
I can fairly hear
my heart beating.

918
01:03:51,690 --> 01:03:53,020
I'll be home in time for supper.

919
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:55,820
In another hour, I'll
be King of the Forest.

920
01:03:55,990 --> 01:03:59,200

wouldn't be afraid of anything?

951
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:27,340
Not nobody. Not no how.

952
01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:29,970
- Not even a rhinoceros?
- Imposserous.

953
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:31,504
How about a hippopotamus?

954
01:06:31,505 --> 01:06:33,980
Why... I'd trash him
from top to "bottom-us."

955
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:35,670
Supposing you met an elephant?

956
01:06:35,671 --> 01:06:37,440
I'd wrap him up in "cello-phant".

957
01:06:37,610 --> 01:06:39,203
What if it were a brontosaurus?

958
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:41,230
I'd show him who's
King of the Forest.

959
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:43,690
- How?
- How?

960
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:45,570
Courage.

961
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:48,740
What makes a King out
of a slave? Courage.

962
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:53,240
What makes the flag on the
mast to wave? Courage.

963
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:55,460
What makes the elephant
charge his tusk

964
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:59,040
in the misty mist
or the dusky dusk?

965
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:04,010
What makes the muskrat
guard his musk? Courage.

966
01:07:04,170 --> 01:07:07,180
What makes the sphinx the
7th Wonder? Courage.

What puts the "ape" in apricot?

970
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:19,100
What have they got
that I ain't got?

971
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:22,230
- Courage.
- You can say that again.

972
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:29,320
The Wizard says go away.

973
01:07:34,370 --> 01:07:36,750
Go away?

974
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:40,330
Looks like we came a
long way for nothing.

975
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:44,670
And I was so happy.

976
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:46,920
I thought I was on my way home.

977
01:07:47,090 --> 01:07:49,760
Don't cry Dorothy, we're
gonna get you to the Wizard.

978
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:52,300
We certainly are.

979
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:54,810
Auntie Em was so good to me

980
01:07:54,970 --> 01:07:57,230
and I never appreciated it.

981
01:07:57,390 --> 01:08:00,690
Running away and
hurting her feelings.

982
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:04,020
Professor Marvel
said she was sick.

983
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:06,150
She may be dying

984
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,280
and it's all my fault.

985
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:14,080
I'll never forgive myself.

986
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:17,040
Never, never, never.

987
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:23,380
Please don't cry any more.

988
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:26,750
I'll get you into
the Wizard somehow.

989
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:31,010
Come on. I had an
Aunt Em myself once.

990
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:52,860
Wait a minute, fellas.

991
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:55,042
I was just thinking,
I really don't

992
01:08:55,043 --> 01:08:56,830
wanna see the Wizard this much.

993
01:08:56,990 --> 01:08:59,000
I'd better wait for you outside.

994
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:02,000
- What's the matter?
- He's just scared again.

995
01:09:02,170 --> 01:09:04,670
Don't you know the Wizard's
gonna give you some courage?

996
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:08,130
I'd be too scared
to ask him for it.

997
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:10,510
Well then, we'll ask him for you.

998
01:09:10,670 --> 01:09:12,840
I'd sooner wait outside.

999
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:14,800
Why? Why?

1000
01:09:14,970 --> 01:09:18,470
Because I'm still scared.

1001
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:25,560
- What happened?
- Somebody pulled my tail.

1002
01:09:25,730 --> 01:09:27,770
You did it yourself.

1003
01:09:28,110 --> 01:09:29,570
Here.

1004
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:31,530
Come on.

1005
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:37,370
Come forward.

1006
01:09:37,530 --> 01:09:39,620
Tell me when it's over.

1007
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:52,220
Look at that. Look at that.

1008
01:09:56,470 --> 01:09:59,100
I wanna go home.

1009
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:02,680
I am Oz

1010
01:10:02,850 --> 01:10:05,730
the great and powerful.

1011
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:08,060
Who are you?

1012
01:10:09,190 --> 01:10:11,110
Who are you?

1013
01:10:16,570 --> 01:10:17,910
If you please,

1014
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,620
I am Dorothy,

1015
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:23,540
the small and meek.

1016
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:26,080
We've come to ask you...

1017
01:10:26,290 --> 01:10:28,040
Silence.

1018
01:10:28,590 --> 01:10:30,840
Jiminy crickets.

1019
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,800
The great and powerful Oz

1020
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:36,970
knows why you have come.

1021
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:39,220
Step forward

1022
01:10:39,390 --> 01:10:41,310
Tin Man.

1023
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:50,690
You dare to come to me
for a heart, do you?

1024
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:53,690
You clinking, clanking, clattering

1025
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:57,530
collection of caliginous junk.

1026
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:02,080
Yes, sir.

1027
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:03,660
Yes, Your Honour.

1028
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:05,290
You see

1029
01:11:05,460 --> 01:11:08,960
a while back, we were walking down
the Yellow Brick Road, and...

1030
01:11:09,130 --> 01:11:10,540
Quiet.

1031
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:15,170
And you, Scarecrow,

1032
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:18,680
have the effrontery
to ask for a brain,

1033
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:23,600
you billowing bale
of bovine fodder.

1034
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:26,930
Yes, Your Honour. I
mean, Your Excellency.

1035
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:29,350
I mean, Your Wizardry.

1036
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:31,230
Enough.

1037
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:34,150
And you, Lion.

1038
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:42,200
Well?

1039
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:50,500
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself

1040
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:53,750
frightening him like that
when he came to you for help.

1041
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:56,550
Silence, whippersnapper.

1042
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:59,859
The beneficent Oz
has every intention

1043
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:02,090
of granting your requests.

1044
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:05,680
What's that? What'd he
say? Huh? What'd he say?

1045
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:09,310
But first, you must
prove yourselves worthy

1046
01:12:09,480 --> 01:12:13,270
by performing a very small task.

1047
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:17,940
Bring me the broomstick
of the Witch of the West.

1048
01:12:18,110 --> 01:12:21,240
But if we do that, we'll
have to kill her to get it.

1049
01:12:21,410 --> 01:12:23,870
Bring me her broomstick

1050
01:12:24,030 --> 01:12:27,040
and I'll grant your requests.

1051
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,830
Now go.

1052
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,290
But what if she kills us first?

1053
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:33,750
I said go.

1054
01:13:19,630 --> 01:13:23,930
"I'd turn back if I were you."

1055
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:56,630
I believe there's
spooks around here.

1056
01:13:56,790 --> 01:14:00,130
That's ridiculous.
Spooks. That's silly.

1057
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:02,590
Don't you believe in spooks?

1058
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,010
No. Why, only...

1059
01:14:13,810 --> 01:14:15,770
Are you all right?

1060
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:17,520
I do believe in spooks.

1061
01:14:17,690 --> 01:14:19,820
I do, I do, I do, I do.

1062
01:14:20,150 --> 01:14:24,650
I do believe in spooks. I
do, I do, I do, I do, I do.

1063
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:29,620
You'll believe in more than that
before I'm finished with you.

1064
01:14:31,790 --> 01:14:33,270
Take your army to
the haunted forest

1065
01:14:33,271 --> 01:14:34,710
and bring me that
girl and her dog.

1066
01:14:34,870 --> 01:14:38,170
Do what you like with the others,
but I want her alive and unharmed.

1067
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,840
They'll give you no trouble,
I promise you that.

1068
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:45,090
I've sent a little insect on ahead
to take the fight out of them.

1069
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,569
Take special care of those ruby

1070
01:14:47,570 --> 01:14:49,680
slippers. I want
those most of all.

1071
01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:51,560
Now, fly. Fly.

1072
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,270
Bring me that girl
and her slippers.

1073
01:14:54,430 --> 01:14:57,310
Fly. Fly. Fly.

1074
01:15:25,970 --> 01:15:28,090
Help. Help.

1075
01:15:28,510 --> 01:15:30,180
Go away now.

1076
01:15:32,510 --> 01:15:35,560
Toto. Toto. Help.

1077
01:15:50,530 --> 01:15:53,490
Help. Help. Help.

1078
01:15:53,660 --> 01:15:54,990
What's happened to you?

1079
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,500
They tore my legs off and
they threw them over there.

1080
01:15:57,660 --> 01:16:00,250
Then they took my chest out
and they threw it over there.

1081
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:01,750
Well, that's you all over.

1082
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,920
They sure knocked the stuffings
outta ya, didn't they.

1083
01:16:04,090 --> 01:16:05,735
Don't stand there gawking, put me

1084
01:16:05,736 --> 01:16:07,630
together. We've got
to find Dorothy.

1085
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,300
Now, let's see...

1086
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:15,350
What a nice little dog.

1087
01:16:18,850 --> 01:16:22,520
And you, my dear, what
an unexpected pleasure.

1088
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:27,070
It's so kind of you to
visit me in my loneliness.

1089
01:16:28,490 --> 01:16:31,280
What are you gonna do with
my dog? Give him back to me.

1090
01:16:31,450 --> 01:16:33,910
All in good time,
my little pretty.

1091
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:38,040
- All in good time.
- Please give me back my dog.

1092
01:16:38,210 --> 01:16:40,540
Certainly, certainly

1093
01:16:40,710 --> 01:16:43,670
when you give me those slippers.

1094
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,674
But the Good Witch told me not to.

1095
01:16:46,675 --> 01:16:47,675
Very well.

1096
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:50,010
Throw that basket in the
river and drown him.

1097
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:54,300
No, here. You can have your old
slippers, but give me back Toto.

1098
01:16:54,470 --> 01:16:56,140
That's a good little girl.

1099
01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:58,930
I knew you'd see reason.

1100
01:17:02,230 --> 01:17:05,650
I'm sorry. I didn't do it.
Can I still have my dog?

1101
01:17:05,820 --> 01:17:10,150
No. Fool that I am, I
should have remembered

1102
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,570
those slippers will never come off

1103
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:16,660
as long as you're alive.

1104
01:17:16,830 --> 01:17:20,660
But that's not what's worrying
me, it's how to do it.

1105
01:17:20,830 --> 01:17:23,370
These things must
be done delicately

1106
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:25,750
or you hurt the spell.

1107
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:29,630
- Run, Toto, run.
- Catch him, you fool.

1108
01:17:39,310 --> 01:17:41,310
Run, Toto, run.

1109
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:44,140
Run, Toto, run.

1110
01:17:45,020 --> 01:17:47,690
He got away. He got away.

1111
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:50,400
Which is more than you will.

1112
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:52,110
Drat, you and your dog.

1113
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:53,653
You've been more
trouble to me than

1114
01:17:53,654 --> 01:17:54,950
you're worth, one way or another.

1115
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:58,200
But it'll soon be over now.

1116
01:17:59,660 --> 01:18:01,000
Do you see that?

1117
01:18:01,160 --> 01:18:03,710
That's how much longer
you've got to be alive.

1118
01:18:03,870 --> 01:18:07,080
And it isn't long, my
pretty. It isn't long.

1119
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:10,050
I can't wait forever
to get those shoes.

1120
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:33,900
I'm frightened.

1121
01:18:34,070 --> 01:18:37,870
I'm frightened, Auntie
Em. I'm frightened.

1122
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:43,160
Dorothy. Dorothy.

1123
01:18:43,330 --> 01:18:46,920
Where are you? It's
me. It's Auntie Em.

1124
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:50,250
We're trying to find
you. Where are you?

1125
01:18:50,420 --> 01:18:52,460
I'm here in Oz, Auntie Em.

1126
01:18:52,630 --> 01:18:54,970
I'm locked up in
the Witch's castle

1127
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:58,140
and I'm trying to get
home to you, Auntie Em.

1128
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:00,890
Oh, Auntie Em, don't go away.

1129
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:04,430
I'm frightened. Come
back. Come back.

1130
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:07,690
"Auntie Em, Auntie Em. Come back."

1131
01:19:07,850 --> 01:19:10,400
I'll give you Auntie
Em, my pretty.

1132
01:19:36,930 --> 01:19:41,300
Look. There's Toto.
Where'd he come from?

1133
01:19:42,430 --> 01:19:46,930
Why, don't you see? He's
come to take us to Dorothy.

1134
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,520
Come on, fellas.

1135
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:09,960
I hope my strength holds out.

1136
01:20:10,130 --> 01:20:12,840
I hope your tail holds out.

1137
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:26,430
What's that? What's that?

1138
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:29,390
That's the castle of
the Wicked Witch.

1139
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:33,230
- Dorothy's in that awful place?
- I hate to think of her in there.

1140
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:36,150
- We've got to get her out.
- Don't cry now.

1141
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,199
We haven't got the
oil can, and you've

1142
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,740
been squeaking enough as it is.

1143
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:41,860
Who's them? Who's them?

1144
01:20:56,170 --> 01:20:58,455
I've got a plan how
to get in there.

1145
01:20:58,456 --> 01:20:59,920
Fine, he's got a plan.

1146
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:02,930
And you're gonna lead us.

1147
01:21:03,090 --> 01:21:05,510
- Me?
- Yes, you.

1148
01:21:05,970 --> 01:21:09,390
- I gotta get her outta there?
- That's right.

1149
01:21:10,190 --> 01:21:12,810
All right, I'll go in
there for Dorothy.

1150
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:14,980
Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch

1151
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:18,780
guards or no guards,
I'll tear 'em apart.

1152
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:23,030
I may not come out alive,
but I'm going in there.

1153
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:26,110
There's only one thing I
want you fellas to do.

1154
01:21:26,111 --> 01:21:27,111
What's that?

1155
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:29,540
Talk me out of it.

1156
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:32,620
- No, you don't.
- Oh, no.

1157
01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:34,580
- Now, wait a minute.
- Up.

1158
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:36,690
Come on, I've got another idea.

1159
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:40,440
Do you think it would be
polite, dropping in like this?

1160
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:16,640
Where do we go now?

1161
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:20,270
There.

1162
01:23:29,910 --> 01:23:32,990
Wait. We better make sure.
Dorothy, are you in there?

1163
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:35,080
- It's us.
- Yes.

1164
01:23:35,250 --> 01:23:38,210
It's me. She's locked me in.

1165
01:23:38,370 --> 01:23:40,790
We gotta get her
out. Open the door.

1166
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:43,000
Hurry. Please hurry.

1167
01:23:43,170 --> 01:23:44,960
The hourglass is almost empty.

1168
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:46,760
Stand back.

1169
01:24:02,610 --> 01:24:05,230
Toto. Toto. Lion.

1170
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:07,440
I knew you'd come.
I knew you would.

1171
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:10,450
Hurry, we've got no time to lose.

1172
01:24:21,830 --> 01:24:25,590
Going so soon? I
wouldn't hear of it.

1173
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:29,800
Why, my little party's
just beginning.

1174
01:24:29,970 --> 01:24:32,680
Trapped. Trapped
like mice... rats.

1175
01:24:41,350 --> 01:24:43,900
That's right. Don't
hurt them right away.

1176
01:24:44,070 --> 01:24:46,690
We'll let them think
about it a little first.

1177
01:24:56,660 --> 01:24:58,910
Seize them. Seize them.

1178
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:00,910
Stop them, you fools.

1179
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:04,460
Seize them. Seize them.

1180
01:25:13,390 --> 01:25:15,100
There they go. Now we've got them.

1181
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:17,640
Half of you go this way,
half of you go that way.

1182
01:25:17,850 --> 01:25:18,970
Hurry. Hurry.

1183
01:25:26,770 --> 01:25:28,780
Where do we go now?

1184
01:25:28,940 --> 01:25:31,740
This way. Come on.

1185
01:25:38,450 --> 01:25:39,660
Back. Back.

1186
01:25:58,140 --> 01:25:59,850
Well.

1187
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:02,810
Ring-around the Rosie, a
pocket full of spears.

1188
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:05,690
Thought you'd be pretty
foxy, didn't you?

1189
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:09,980
Well, the last to go will see
the first 3 go before her.

1190
01:26:11,530 --> 01:26:13,200
And her mangy little dog too.

1191
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:23,870
How about a little
fire, Scarecrow?

1192
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:29,460
Help. I'm burning. I'm
burning. It's burning. Help.

1193
01:26:29,630 --> 01:26:31,090
Don't throw that water.

1194
01:26:33,550 --> 01:26:35,840
You cursed brat. Look
what you've done.

1195
01:26:36,010 --> 01:26:38,510
I'm melting. Melting.

1196
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:41,060
Oh, what a world. What a world.

1197
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:43,680
Who would've thought a
good little girl like you

1198
01:26:43,850 --> 01:26:46,940
could destroy my
beautiful wickedness?

1199
01:26:47,110 --> 01:26:49,730
Look out. Look out.

1200
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:51,940
I'm going.

1201
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:10,000
She's dead. You've killed her.

1202
01:27:10,170 --> 01:27:13,420
I didn't mean to kill
her. Really, I didn't.

1203
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:16,340
It's just that he was on fire.

1204
01:27:16,510 --> 01:27:18,890
Hail to Dorothy. The
Wicked Witch is dead.

1205
01:27:19,050 --> 01:27:22,890
Hail. Hail to Dorothy. The
Wicked Witch is dead.

1206
01:27:23,060 --> 01:27:24,350
The broom.

1207
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,020
- May we have it?
- Please, and take it with you.

1208
01:27:27,190 --> 01:27:29,650
Thank you so much.

1209
01:27:29,810 --> 01:27:31,269
Now we can go back
to the Wizard and

1210
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:32,650
tell him the Wicked Witch is dead.

1211
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:34,280
The Wicked Witch is dead.

1212
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:37,030
Can I believe my eyes?

1213
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:40,280
Why have you come back?

1214
01:27:41,370 --> 01:27:44,290
Please, sir. We've
done what you told us.

1215
01:27:44,450 --> 01:27:47,710
We've brought you the broomstick
of the Wicked Witch of the West.

1216
01:27:47,870 --> 01:27:49,920
We melted her.

1217
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:53,840
You liquidated her?

1218
01:27:54,010 --> 01:27:56,010
- Very resourceful.
- Yes, sir.

1219
01:27:56,170 --> 01:27:59,590
So we'd like you to keep your
promise to us, if you please, sir.

1220
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:03,100
Not so fast. Not so fast.

1221
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:05,850
I'll have to give the
matter a little thought.

1222
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:09,060
Go away and come back tomorrow.

1223
01:28:09,230 --> 01:28:13,440
Tomorrow? But I wanna go home now.

1224
01:28:13,610 --> 01:28:16,570
You've had plenty of time already.

1225
01:28:16,740 --> 01:28:20,610
Do not arouse the wrath of
the great and powerful Oz.

1226
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:23,910
I said come back tomorrow.

1227
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:25,498
If you were really great and

1228
01:28:25,499 --> 01:28:27,160
powerful, you'd
keep your promises.

1229
01:28:27,330 --> 01:28:31,000
Do you presume to
criticise the great Oz?

1230
01:28:31,170 --> 01:28:33,670
You ungrateful creatures.

1231
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:37,590
Think yourselves lucky that I'm
giving you audience tomorrow

1232
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:40,590
instead of 20 years from now.

1233
01:28:42,220 --> 01:28:46,640
The great Oz has spoken.

1234
01:28:46,810 --> 01:28:50,600
Pay no attention to that
man behind the curtain.

1235
01:28:50,770 --> 01:28:54,150
The great and... Oz has spoken.

1236
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:56,270
Who are you?

1237
01:28:56,440 --> 01:29:00,450
I am the great and
powerful Wizard of Oz.

1238
01:29:00,610 --> 01:29:03,870
You are? I don't believe you.

1239
01:29:04,030 --> 01:29:07,490
I'm afraid it's true. There's
no other Wizard except me.

1240
01:29:07,660 --> 01:29:10,000
You humbug.

1241
01:29:10,410 --> 01:29:13,670
Yes, that's exactly
so. I'm a humbug.

1242
01:29:14,590 --> 01:29:16,800
You're a very bad man.

1243
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,970
No, my dear. I'm a very good man.

1244
01:29:20,130 --> 01:29:23,680
I'm just a very bad wizard.

1245
01:29:24,010 --> 01:29:25,890
What about the heart
you promised Tin Man?

1246
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:28,060
And the courage you
promised Cowardly Lion?

1247
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:30,140
- And Scarecrow's brain?
- And Scarecrow's brain?

1248
01:29:30,310 --> 01:29:34,230
Why, anybody can have a brain.
That's a very mediocre commodity.

1249
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:37,270
Every pusillanimous creature
that crawls on the earth

1250
01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:40,900
or slinks through slimy
seas has a brain.

1251
01:29:41,070 --> 01:29:43,280
Back where I come from,
we have universities,

1252
01:29:43,450 --> 01:29:46,830
seats of great learning, where
men go to become great thinkers.

1253
01:29:47,030 --> 01:29:49,328
And when they come out,
they think deep thoughts,

1254
01:29:49,329 --> 01:29:51,120
and with no more
brains than you have.

1255
01:29:51,290 --> 01:29:55,290
But they have one thing you
haven't got, a diploma.

1256
01:29:55,460 --> 01:29:59,500
Therefore, by virtue of the
authority vested in me,

1257
01:29:59,670 --> 01:30:03,510
by the Universitatus
Committeeatum E Pluribus Unum

1258
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:05,840
I hereby confer upon you

1259
01:30:06,010 --> 01:30:10,970
- the honorary degree of Th.D.
- Th.D?

1260
01:30:11,180 --> 01:30:13,520
That's Doctor of Thinkology.

1261
01:30:13,770 --> 01:30:16,480
The sum of the square roots of any
2 sides of an isosceles triangle

1262
01:30:16,730 --> 01:30:19,610
is equal to the square root
of the remaining side.

1263
01:30:20,860 --> 01:30:22,820
Joy. Rapture.

1264
01:30:22,990 --> 01:30:24,740
I've got a brain.

1265
01:30:24,910 --> 01:30:27,200
- How can I ever thank you enough?
- Well, you can't.

1266
01:30:27,370 --> 01:30:31,290
As for you, my fine friend, you're
a victim of disorganised thinking.

1267
01:30:31,450 --> 01:30:33,420
You are under the
unfortunate delusion that

1268
01:30:33,421 --> 01:30:35,210
simply because you
run away from danger

1269
01:30:35,370 --> 01:30:39,290
you have no courage. You're
confusing courage with wisdom.

1270
01:30:39,460 --> 01:30:43,420
Back where I come from, we have
men who are called "heroes."

1271
01:30:43,590 --> 01:30:46,760
Once a year, they take their
fortitude out of mothballs

1272
01:30:46,930 --> 01:30:49,180
and parade it down the
main street of the city.

1273
01:30:49,350 --> 01:30:51,560
And they have no more
courage than you have.

1274
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:56,810
But they have one thing that
you haven't got, a medal.

1275
01:30:56,980 --> 01:30:58,310
Therefore,

1276
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:02,070
for meritorious conduct,
extraordinary valour,

1277
01:31:02,230 --> 01:31:05,360
conspicuous bravery
against wicked witches,

1278
01:31:05,530 --> 01:31:08,780
I award you the Triple Cross.

1279
01:31:08,950 --> 01:31:11,580
You are now a member of
the Legion of Courage.

1280
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:18,000
Shucks folks, I'm speechless.

1281
01:31:19,170 --> 01:31:23,170
As for you, my galvanised
friend, you want a heart.

1282
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:25,970
You don't know how lucky
you are not to have one.

1283
01:31:26,130 --> 01:31:28,483
Hearts will never
be practical until

1284
01:31:28,484 --> 01:31:30,390
they can be made unbreakable.

1285
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:33,310
But I still want one.

1286
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,594
Back where I come
from, there are men

1287
01:31:35,595 --> 01:31:37,640
who do nothing all
day but good deeds.

1288
01:31:37,810 --> 01:31:40,310
They are called philo... philo...

1289
01:31:41,570 --> 01:31:44,860
goodeedoers. And their hearts
are no bigger than yours.

1290
01:31:45,030 --> 01:31:49,240
But they have one thing you
haven't got, a testimonial.

1291
01:31:49,410 --> 01:31:52,200
Therefore, in consideration
of your kindness

1292
01:31:52,370 --> 01:31:55,200
I take pleasure at this
time in presenting you

1293
01:31:55,370 --> 01:31:59,000
with a small token of our
esteem and affection.

1294
01:31:59,170 --> 01:32:02,090
And remember, my
sentimental friend,

1295
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:05,380
that a heart is not judged
by how much you love

1296
01:32:05,550 --> 01:32:08,550
but by how much you
are loved by others.

1297
01:32:11,470 --> 01:32:13,810
It ticks.

1298
01:32:13,970 --> 01:32:16,350
Listen. Look, it ticks.

1299
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:19,600
Read what my medal
says... "Courage."

1300
01:32:19,770 --> 01:32:22,110
Ain't it the truth.
Ain't it the truth.

1301
01:32:22,270 --> 01:32:23,900
They're all wonderful.

1302
01:32:24,070 --> 01:32:26,440
Hey, what about Dorothy?

1303
01:32:26,610 --> 01:32:28,121
Yes, how about Dorothy?

1304
01:32:28,122 --> 01:32:30,660
- Yeah, Dorothy next.
- Yeah, Dorothy...

1305
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:34,370
I don't think there's anything
in that black bag for me.

1306
01:32:34,540 --> 01:32:36,580
Well, you force me into
a cataclysmic decision.

1307
01:32:36,750 --> 01:32:38,825
The only way to get
Dorothy to Kansas

1308
01:32:38,826 --> 01:32:40,790
is for me to take
her there myself.

1309
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:45,630
Will you? Could you?

1310
01:32:46,210 --> 01:32:48,420
But are you a clever enough
wizard to manage it?

1311
01:32:48,590 --> 01:32:52,680
Child, you cut me to the quick.
I'm an old Kansas man myself,

1312
01:32:52,850 --> 01:32:55,600
born and bred in the heart
of the western wilderness,

1313
01:32:55,770 --> 01:32:57,936
premier balloonist par
excellence to the

1314
01:32:57,937 --> 01:32:59,890
Miracle Wonderland
Carnival Company.

1315
01:33:00,060 --> 01:33:02,098
Until one day, while performing

1316
01:33:02,099 --> 01:33:04,860
spectacular feats of
stratospheric skill

1317
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:07,400
never before attempted
by civilised man

1318
01:33:07,570 --> 01:33:09,895
an unfortunate phenomena
occurred. The

1319
01:33:09,896 --> 01:33:12,160
balloon failed to
return to the fair.

1320
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,450
- It did?
- Weren't you frightened?

1321
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:16,347
Frightened? You are
talking to a man

1322
01:33:16,348 --> 01:33:18,120
who has laughed in
the face of death,

1323
01:33:18,290 --> 01:33:22,960
sneered at doom and chuckled at
catastrophe. I was petrified.

1324
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:24,790
Then, suddenly the wind changed

1325
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:28,300
and the balloon floated down into
the heart of this noble city

1326
01:33:28,460 --> 01:33:33,680
where I was instantly acclaimed
Oz, the First Wizard Deluxe.

1327
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:36,680
Times being what they
were, I accepted the job

1328
01:33:36,850 --> 01:33:41,140
retaining my balloon against
the advent of a quick getaway.

1329
01:33:41,310 --> 01:33:43,440
And in that balloon,
my dear Dorothy

1330
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:48,610
you and I will return to the
land of E Pluribus Unum.

1331
01:33:53,990 --> 01:33:57,660
My friends. I mean, my friends.

1332
01:34:02,620 --> 01:34:07,090
This is positively the finest
exhibition ever to be shown,

1333
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:09,210
be that as it may.

1334
01:34:09,380 --> 01:34:13,050
I, your Wizard per ardua ad alta,

1335
01:34:13,220 --> 01:34:15,550
am about to embark
upon a hazardous

1336
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:18,600
and technically
unexplainable journey

1337
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:22,060
into the outer stratosphere.

1338
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:26,770
To confer, converse

1339
01:34:26,940 --> 01:34:30,530
and otherwise hobnob
with my brother wizards.

1340
01:34:30,690 --> 01:34:34,280
And I hereby decree
that until what time,

1341
01:34:34,450 --> 01:34:36,780
if any, that I return,

1342
01:34:36,950 --> 01:34:41,700
the Scarecrow, by virtue of
his highly superior brains

1343
01:34:41,870 --> 01:34:43,750
shall rule in my stead,

1344
01:34:43,910 --> 01:34:48,500
assisted by the Tin Man, by
virtue of his magnificent heart

1345
01:34:48,670 --> 01:34:52,510
and the Lion, by
virtue of his courage.

1346
01:34:52,670 --> 01:34:55,300
Obey them as you
would me. Thank you.

1347
01:34:59,140 --> 01:35:02,140
Toto. Come back. Toto.

1348
01:35:02,310 --> 01:35:04,730
Don't go without me.
I'll be right back.

1349
01:35:04,890 --> 01:35:05,940
Stop that dog.

1350
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:08,612
This is a highly
irregular procedure.

1351
01:35:08,613 --> 01:35:10,860
This is absolutely unprecedented.

1352
01:35:11,030 --> 01:35:14,110
- Ruined my exit.
- Come back. Come back.

1353
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:16,820
Don't go without me.
Please come back.

1354
01:35:16,990 --> 01:35:20,330
I can't come back. I
don't know how it works.

1355
01:35:20,490 --> 01:35:21,990
Goodbye, folks.

1356
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:24,290
Goodbye.

1357
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:30,590
Now I'll never get home.

1358
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:33,380
Stay with us then, Dorothy.

1359
01:35:33,550 --> 01:35:35,260
We all love you.

1360
01:35:35,420 --> 01:35:37,930
We don't want you to go.

1361
01:35:38,090 --> 01:35:40,430
That's very kind of you

1362
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:43,680
but this could never
be like Kansas.

1363
01:35:43,850 --> 01:35:46,274
Auntie Em must have
stopped wondering

1364
01:35:46,275 --> 01:35:48,060
what happened to me by now.

1365
01:35:48,230 --> 01:35:51,270
Scarecrow, what am I gonna do?

1366
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:54,280
Look.

1367
01:35:54,690 --> 01:35:56,570
Here's someone who can help you.

1368
01:36:30,270 --> 01:36:32,186
Will you help me? Can you help me?

1369
01:36:32,187 --> 01:36:34,360
You don't need to be
helped any longer.

1370
01:36:34,530 --> 01:36:37,360
You've always had the power
to go back to Kansas.

1371
01:36:37,530 --> 01:36:38,530
I have?

1372
01:36:38,531 --> 01:36:40,450
Then why didn't you
tell her before?

1373
01:36:40,610 --> 01:36:42,504
Because she wouldn't have believed

1374
01:36:42,505 --> 01:36:44,620
me. She had to learn
it for herself.

1375
01:36:44,790 --> 01:36:47,200
What have you learned, Dorothy?

1376
01:36:47,410 --> 01:36:49,040
Well,

1377
01:36:50,540 --> 01:36:52,290
I think that it...

1378
01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:56,460
that it wasn't enough just to want
to see Uncle Henry and Auntie Em.

1379
01:36:56,630 --> 01:36:59,216
And it's that, if
I ever go looking

1380
01:36:59,217 --> 01:37:01,300
for my heart's desire again,

1381
01:37:01,470 --> 01:37:04,890
I won't look any further
than my own back yard

1382
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:07,390
because if it isn't there

1383
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:10,640
I never really lost
it to begin with.

1384
01:37:10,810 --> 01:37:11,940
Is that right?

1385
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:13,900
That's all it is.

1386
01:37:14,060 --> 01:37:17,230
But that's so easy. I should've
thought of it for you.

1387
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:19,056
I should've felt it in my heart.

1388
01:37:19,057 --> 01:37:21,150
No, she had to find
it out for herself.

1389
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:24,820
Now those magic slippers will
take you home in 2 seconds.

1390
01:37:24,990 --> 01:37:27,540
- Toto too?
- Toto too.

1391
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:29,790
- Now?
- Whenever you wish.

1392
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:33,460
Dear, that's too
wonderful to be true.

1393
01:37:35,210 --> 01:37:36,290
It's...

1394
01:37:36,460 --> 01:37:39,920
it's gonna be so
hard to say goodbye.

1395
01:37:40,090 --> 01:37:42,470
I love you all too.

1396
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:46,800
Goodbye, Tin Man.

1397
01:37:46,970 --> 01:37:49,220
Don't cry.

1398
01:37:49,430 --> 01:37:52,440
You'll rust so dreadfully.

1399
01:37:53,150 --> 01:37:56,270
Here, here's your oilcan.

1400
01:37:57,780 --> 01:38:00,650
- Goodbye.
- Now I know I've got a heart

1401
01:38:00,820 --> 01:38:02,900
because it's breaking.

1402
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:09,580
Goodbye, Lion. You know,
I know it isn't right

1403
01:38:09,750 --> 01:38:13,500
but I'm gonna miss the way
you used to holler for help

1404
01:38:13,670 --> 01:38:16,170
before you found your courage.

1405
01:38:16,340 --> 01:38:20,420
I would never have found it
if it hadn't been for you.

1406
01:38:25,140 --> 01:38:28,220
I think I'll miss you most of all.

1407
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:36,270
- Are you ready now?
- Yes.

1408
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:40,150
Say goodbye, Toto.

1409
01:38:42,690 --> 01:38:46,410
- Yes, I'm ready now.
- Then close your eyes

1410
01:38:46,570 --> 01:38:49,580
and tap your heels
together 3 times

1411
01:38:51,750 --> 01:38:53,790
and think to yourself:

1412
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:56,960
"There's no place like home."

1413
01:38:57,130 --> 01:39:00,460
"There's no place like home."

1414
01:39:00,630 --> 01:39:04,170
There's no place like home.

1415
01:39:04,340 --> 01:39:07,840
There's no place like home.

1416
01:39:08,300 --> 01:39:09,970
There's no place like home.

1417
01:39:11,350 --> 01:39:13,220
There's no place like home.

1418
01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:17,020
There's no place like home.

1419
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:23,150
There's no place like home.

1420
01:39:23,940 --> 01:39:26,110
There's no place like home.

1421
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:30,950
- Wake up, honey.
- There's no place like home.

1422
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:34,540
There's no place like home.

1423
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:38,290
There's no...

1424
01:39:41,090 --> 01:39:44,590
Dorothy. Dorothy dear,
it's Aunt Em, darling.

1425
01:39:44,760 --> 01:39:46,840
Auntie Em, it's you.

1426
01:39:47,010 --> 01:39:50,010
- Yes, darling.
- Hello there. Anybody home?

1427
01:39:50,180 --> 01:39:52,039
I just dropped by
because I heard the

1428
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:53,850
little girl got
caught in the big...

1429
01:39:54,020 --> 01:39:55,778
Well, she seems all right now.

1430
01:39:55,779 --> 01:39:57,810
She got quite a bump on the head.

1431
01:39:57,980 --> 01:40:00,520
We kinds thought there for a
minute, she was gonna leave us.

1432
01:40:00,690 --> 01:40:03,400
But I did leave you, Uncle
Henry, that's just the trouble.

1433
01:40:03,570 --> 01:40:05,570
And I tried to get back
for days and days.

1434
01:40:05,740 --> 01:40:07,700
There, there, lie quiet now.

1435
01:40:07,860 --> 01:40:10,950
- You just had a bad dream.
- Sure.

1436
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:12,700
Remember me,

1437
01:40:12,870 --> 01:40:15,120
your old pal, Hunk?

1438
01:40:15,290 --> 01:40:17,910
And me, Hickory?

1439
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:19,920
You couldn't forget
my face, could ya?

1440
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:23,840
No, but it wasn't a
dream, it was a place.

1441
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,670
And you and you and you

1442
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:28,760
and you were there.

1443
01:40:30,010 --> 01:40:31,890
But you couldn't have
been, could you?

1444
01:40:32,050 --> 01:40:34,060
We dream lots of silly
things when we...

1445
01:40:34,220 --> 01:40:38,230
No, Aunt Em, this was a
real, truly live place.

1446
01:40:38,390 --> 01:40:41,480
And I remember that some
of it wasn't very nice

1447
01:40:41,650 --> 01:40:43,610
but most of it was beautiful.

1448
01:40:43,770 --> 01:40:45,659
But just the same,
all I kept saying

1449
01:40:45,660 --> 01:40:47,650
to everybody was, "I
want to go home."

1450
01:40:47,820 --> 01:40:49,900
And they sent me home.

1451
01:40:51,740 --> 01:40:53,570
Doesn't anybody believe me?

1452
01:40:53,740 --> 01:40:55,830
Of course we believe you, Dorothy.

1453
01:40:55,990 --> 01:40:58,500
But anyway, Toto, we're home.

1454
01:40:58,660 --> 01:41:01,500
Home. And this is my room

1455
01:41:01,670 --> 01:41:03,250
and you're all here.

1456
01:41:03,420 --> 01:41:06,630
And I'm not going to leave
here ever, ever again

1457
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:08,760
because I love you all.

1458
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:12,390
And... Auntie Em,

1459
01:41:12,550 --> 01:41:15,600
there's no place like home.
