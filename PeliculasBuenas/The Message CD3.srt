00:00:05,908 --> 00:00:08,164
BATTLE OF UHUD....

There is Hamza can you see him?

2
00:00:14,296 --> 00:00:16,187
He is your fortune

3
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:25,339
Ubada! Those horse-men on the flank out there

4
00:00:27,062 --> 00:00:27,916
they are replaced

5
00:00:28,499 --> 00:00:31,462
they are under Khalid.
Khalid...

6
00:00:31,507 --> 00:00:34,093
I often thought of that yound man

7
00:00:35,852 --> 00:00:36,774
Hamza!

8
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:37,674
Yes!

9
00:00:37,723 --> 00:00:41,654
Prophet asks if you have noticed those horse-men

10
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,628
Yes I have. I don't like them

11
00:00:44,674 --> 00:00:46,896
he's sending our 50 archers to watch them

12
00:00:46,946 --> 00:00:51,914
no matter what happens, 
the archers must hold off those horse-men

13
00:01:05,494 --> 00:01:08,753
Zaid, tell the Prophet that we are ready

14
00:01:10,841 --> 00:01:11,958
What do you think Hamza?

15
00:01:13,882 --> 00:01:18,314
Besides their numbers, I'd say its a fair fight

16
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,587
we see them and they see us

17
00:01:24,275 --> 00:01:26,291
what faces me has never frightened me

18
00:01:28,452 --> 00:01:30,447
All praise be Hubar!

19
00:01:43,524 --> 00:01:49,654
When Muhammed gives the word, we'll go to them

20
00:02:20,018 --> 00:02:21,499
Hamza!

21
00:02:24,462 --> 00:02:26,318
Weapons ready

22
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:33,270
we march now!

23
00:02:38,397 --> 00:02:39,879
attack

24
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:44,766
they've killed Hamza!

25
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,834
tackle them

26
00:05:07,244 --> 00:05:09,397
Fight! Fight!

27
00:05:23,619 --> 00:05:24,940
This is a moment of victory

28
00:05:24,956 --> 00:05:27,577
Running away from us. Let's get the loot

29
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,555
Stand where you are told to stand

30
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:32,824
come back to your positions

31
00:05:32,877 --> 00:05:34,198
all of you, come back!

32
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:36,563
Its a road

33
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,146
Their centry is gone

34
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,808
We've lost the battle, Khalid

35
00:05:42,635 --> 00:05:43,717
Not yet

36
00:06:39,948 --> 00:06:41,133
hold on

37
00:07:30,477 --> 00:07:31,365
Where is the prophet?

38
00:07:31,412 --> 00:07:32,061
Muhammad is dead

39
00:07:32,114 --> 00:07:33,037
I saw him fall

40
00:07:33,084 --> 00:07:37,174
No No! He's alive! Find him!

41
00:07:59,116 --> 00:08:02,113
back. back to the mountains

42
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:43,750
halt

43
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:09,482
I thought we were beaten!
Now, victory is yours, Khalid!

44
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,819
We have no victory until
we've finished Muhammad

45
00:09:11,869 --> 00:09:13,589
he's up in those rocks

46
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,232
We've finished our business. we've avenged Badr

47
00:09:18,286 --> 00:09:20,337
But we can end Islam and him forever!

48
00:09:20,391 --> 00:09:21,906
Some of his fenatics are still with him!

49
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:23,984
They have the advantage of the mountains

50
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:25,389
The risk is too high

51
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:30,194
Muhammad, listen

52
00:09:35,062 --> 00:09:40,565
A day for a day! the day of Uhub for the day of Badr

53
00:09:42,147 --> 00:09:45,234
Our dead have answered to your dead

54
00:09:46,558 --> 00:09:53,292
Our dead are in Paradise,
your dead are in hell fire

55
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:34,473
Hamza! Hamza! do you hear me Hamza?
ok You know that I am with you, I, Hind!

56
00:10:36,686 --> 00:10:42,109
do you remember anything Hamza?
How you killed my father and my brother?

57
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:48,639
now you too are dead!
now, my heart is light

58
00:10:48,984 --> 00:10:51,205
do you hear Hamza? Light!

59
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:04,276
But I haven't finished with you! 
Death is too small

60
00:11:05,225 --> 00:11:09,224
Wahshi, Cut him open, cut him!

61
00:11:31,392 --> 00:11:33,910
They lost a battle and what do they do?

62
00:11:33,966 --> 00:11:36,791
They came home and dig the ground harder

63
00:11:39,012 --> 00:11:39,592
They are mad

64
00:11:40,984 --> 00:11:41,427
I agree with you!

65
00:11:41,484 --> 00:11:46,680
They defy reason,
they are even happy they lost

66
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:53,698
god send the defeat they say
to trial in their faith

67
00:11:53,749 --> 00:11:58,808
Oh yes! they are fighting with the sky!

68
00:12:00,366 --> 00:12:01,517
They'll get what they want!

69
00:12:01,569 --> 00:12:03,220
They want Mecca!

70
00:12:03,273 --> 00:12:04,732
They'll get Mecca

71
00:12:04,778 --> 00:12:06,703
when we see the stars at noon.... 

72
00:12:07,818 --> 00:12:11,316
immm... don't underestimate him, I learned that on my cost

73
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:20,544
my friend, Mecca is more than their home

74
00:12:20,551 --> 00:12:23,559
It's where God spoke to man

75
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:31,331
Mecca is like a home-sickness to the soul

76
00:12:34,252 --> 00:12:35,870
This year they are going as pilgrims

77
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:37,746
What?

78
00:12:37,795 --> 00:12:39,481
Unarmed!

79
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:41,218
Unarmed?

80
00:12:43,409 --> 00:12:45,995
Abu Sufian will slaughter them in the dessert

81
00:12:48,723 --> 00:12:55,320
If you believe in God as they do,
it might be possible not to get slaughtered

82
00:12:58,982 --> 00:13:02,776
But I agree with you, they probably will be

83
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:26,207
Be still, do not let them provoke you.
That is what they want. stand firm

84
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,608
Peace be upon you!

85
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,938
Prophet says: All who love God

86
00:17:32,948 --> 00:17:35,466
must renew their Oaths to him

87
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:36,501
under the tree....

88
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,811
They've sent someone else!

89
00:18:31,665 --> 00:18:35,858
Its Salool.
That means we might come to an agreement

90
00:18:47,807 --> 00:18:54,347
Muhammad, you have been given conditions of truce
between yourself and Mecca

91
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,449
Have you agreed to them yet?

92
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,940
What is this?

93
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:14,231
In the name of God, the most gracious

94
00:19:15,911 --> 00:19:21,119
Who is this new God they call gracious?

95
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:23,505
I do not know him. strike him out

96
00:19:24,767 --> 00:19:30,271
And I cannot agree with this...
"Muhammad, the messenger of God?"

97
00:19:31,485 --> 00:19:35,085
If I have thought you were the messenger of God

98
00:19:35,093 --> 00:19:37,383
I would not have fought you

99
00:19:40,106 --> 00:19:49,313
Make it "Muhammad, the son of Abdullah
agrees with Suheil, the son of Amr"

100
00:19:49,364 --> 00:19:51,756
That is the more fact

101
00:19:51,803 --> 00:19:53,228
well, so I understand

102
00:19:57,384 --> 00:20:00,608
good, that is better

103
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:02,151
Now, it is agreed

104
00:20:03,232 --> 00:20:06,924
that you do not continue your pilgrimage,

105
00:20:06,942 --> 00:20:09,562
you must turn around and go home

106
00:20:09,615 --> 00:20:11,233
Mecca is home

107
00:20:13,926 --> 00:20:19,703
However, you may continue your
pilgrimage next year

108
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:21,622
and for 3 days only

109
00:20:21,646 --> 00:20:27,947
in and out.
we also agree to the truce

110
00:20:29,031 --> 00:20:35,196
for 10 years...
During that time you will not attack any

111
00:20:35,214 --> 00:20:39,681
tribe or ambush any caravan

112
00:20:39,726 --> 00:20:45,229
or any individual associated with us and vice versa

113
00:20:47,077 --> 00:20:59,065
If you injure any one of us, the truce ends
and vice versa. Is that clear?

114
00:21:07,463 --> 00:21:11,189
10 years... 10 years of peace....

115
00:21:12,776 --> 00:21:14,326
We need that time

116
00:21:15,784 --> 00:21:17,641
We will use that time

117
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,313
These letters, from Muhammad, the messenger of God

118
00:21:46,262 --> 00:21:48,153
to rulers of the world

119
00:21:48,835 --> 00:21:54,100
Call the world to Islam.
to Heraclius, emperor of Byzantium

120
00:21:55,084 --> 00:22:01,192
Kisra, Emperor of Persia,
Mephocus, patriarch of Alexandria

121
00:22:04,776 --> 00:22:05,858
God is great

122
00:22:34,184 --> 00:22:40,007
There are no different races in Islam and 

123
00:22:40,033 --> 00:22:42,540
Arab is not superior to foreign

124
00:22:42,572 --> 00:22:49,705
not a  white man superior to a black.
All return equally to god

125
00:22:51,094 --> 00:22:52,712
Unless you desire for your neighbour,

126
00:22:52,765 --> 00:22:56,559
what you desire for yourself.
You don't have faith

127
00:22:57,945 --> 00:23:00,166
A man goes to bed with his belly full,

128
00:23:00,218 --> 00:23:04,649
while his neighbor is hungry.
He isn't a Muslim

129
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,263
The Ink of a scholar is holier than
the blood of a martyr

130
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:16,759
A man reading is handsome in the side of god

131
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:21,876
So, learn to read and when you have learned

132
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:24,195
teach

133
00:23:25,214 --> 00:23:26,673
The people of the book,

134
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:30,650
Jews with their Bible, the Christians with their testament


135
00:23:30,662 --> 00:23:35,288
must be respected by you for their books likewise came from god

136
00:23:37,445 --> 00:23:39,963
you must all think of Muhammad as more than a man

137
00:23:43,261 --> 00:23:47,454
He was collecting firewood one day.
Let me do it, I said

138
00:23:47,505 --> 00:23:53,259
Why? He said,
You're the prophet of god,

139
00:23:53,286 --> 00:23:57,764
you can't go round scratching for firewood

140
00:23:58,868 --> 00:24:01,363
But he looked at me mumbling

141
00:24:03,044 --> 00:24:05,973
God does not like the man
who considers himself above

142
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:09,735
other men, he said.
So, I laid back and watched him

143
00:24:10,764 --> 00:24:16,530
Suddenly he stopped.
he stood to his full height and came to me

144
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,136
Yes!

145
00:24:19,854 --> 00:24:26,896
I am the Prophet of god, he said, 
but even I do not know what will become of me

146
00:25:12,188 --> 00:25:14,774
Arm. have you come to take me again?

147
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:16,553
No

148
00:25:17,668 --> 00:25:19,161
I've come to ask you to take me

149
00:25:39,758 --> 00:25:49,135
I witness that there is only one god
and that Muhammad is His messenger

150
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,787
May god forgive me the times I have fought against you

151
00:25:57,671 --> 00:26:01,761
lslam does the way with all that went before it

152
00:26:06,794 --> 00:26:08,719
I'm sorry, I came here wearing... 

153
00:26:11,941 --> 00:26:13,296
Here are my jewels,

154
00:26:14,847 --> 00:26:16,272
what they are worth

155
00:26:17,822 --> 00:26:19,109
I give to the poor

156
00:26:24,072 --> 00:26:24,755
And may I offer you my ?

157
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,195
Yes

158
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,179
But you were the bitterest sword against Islam

159
00:26:37,238 --> 00:26:43,471
Now by the will of god,
I will be the raised sword of god

160
00:27:01,534 --> 00:27:04,257
Ah, its all easy to god

161
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:09,270
Just as he might gain in losing
be may lose in winning

162
00:27:10,357 --> 00:27:14,049
2 years agon we thought we were beaten
when we had to sign that truce

163
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:19,796
Look at us now! charging from victory to victory in the hearts of men

164
00:27:23,724 --> 00:27:24,771
What's that?

165
00:27:57,744 --> 00:28:00,170
Abu Sufian is coming

166
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,023
Why am I insulted like this?

167
00:28:38,047 --> 00:28:38,970
Abu Sufian

168
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:43,677
I expect some courtesy

169
00:28:45,231 --> 00:28:46,416
we are not at war

170
00:28:46,468 --> 00:28:47,619
we have a truce

171
00:28:50,512 --> 00:28:52,369
I've come to speak to Muhammad
Where is he?

172
00:28:53,821 --> 00:28:54,709
he is in the mosque

173
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:14,995
Muhammad we did not break the truce

174
00:29:15,042 --> 00:29:17,594
I have come to re-affirm the truce

175
00:29:17,648 --> 00:29:19,437
I speak for Mecca

176
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:23,347
Muhammad, why do you turn from me?

177
00:29:23,396 --> 00:29:24,820
Don't go

178
00:29:24,866 --> 00:29:27,886
Muhammad, don't go

179
00:29:27,941 --> 00:29:34,709
Biduns broke the truce, not us.
The night was dark

180
00:29:36,129 --> 00:29:44,504
I am here to testify that the night was dark
Baara! This is your city

181
00:29:49,295 --> 00:29:51,665
Hudaifa, you are my kin
and descendant

182
00:29:51,668 --> 00:29:52,876
why must you be hard?

183
00:29:59,722 --> 00:30:04,417
I am Mecca, I am the leader of Mecca

184
00:30:04,468 --> 00:30:07,020
Why am I insulted like this?

185
00:30:08,177 --> 00:30:10,969
Because you keep no promise 
and respect no pledge

186
00:30:14,928 --> 00:30:16,683
I've heard what I thought
I'd never hear

187
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:19,250
Abu Sufian asking for pity

188
00:30:25,689 --> 00:30:31,010
To be out-fought, out-fought

189
00:30:31,002 --> 00:30:34,079
who we knew to be a one time shepherd

190
00:30:34,143 --> 00:30:37,140
you saw that shepherd's religion grow from a speck (dust)

191
00:30:37,185 --> 00:30:39,076
speck was in my eye

192
00:30:39,123 --> 00:30:42,484
I could see nothing

193
00:30:44,737 --> 00:30:49,135
Tell Mecca that the gods are dead.
It is useless to resist god

194
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:53,249
Travel fast or every man here

195
00:30:53,259 --> 00:30:54,340
will curse behind you

196
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:56,981
Its you who have broken the truce

197
00:31:42,251 --> 00:31:46,079
For tonight will be 10,000 men from every tribe

198
00:32:04,006 --> 00:32:05,863
Now we can fight them. you are back

199
00:32:05,911 --> 00:32:08,406
we will close the streets, and defend from the houses

200
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,222
Its no use

201
00:32:16,873 --> 00:32:19,766
There are thousands of them and they are joined by more

202
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,032
You coward!

203
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:23,612
Hind, go home!

204
00:32:23,656 --> 00:32:27,052
You coward! Are you the leader of Mecca?

205
00:32:27,099 --> 00:32:28,580
Look at yourself!

206
00:32:28,636 --> 00:32:32,065
You are broke, they swallowed you and sput you out

207
00:32:32,111 --> 00:32:36,009
When my father and brother die, my husband ran away?

208
00:32:36,055 --> 00:32:37,946
You go home! You!

209
00:32:37,993 --> 00:32:41,958
We can not resist! Mecca is taken

210
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:46,526
No, no!

211
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,316
We are to camp here for the night

212
00:32:56,506 --> 00:33:00,438
We can see Mecca even through the mountains!

213
00:33:12,047 --> 00:33:14,599
So many fires, I can not count them

214
00:33:14,654 --> 00:33:17,274
It is very beautiful

215
00:33:19,632 --> 00:33:24,691
When we drove them out of Mecca, I did not know
that he carried Mecca with him

216
00:33:26,183 --> 00:33:28,005
we can smell the bread they are baking

217
00:33:28,054 --> 00:33:29,239
Yes

218
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:33,791
It means they don't intend to plonder,
though I do hope at least thats what it means

219
00:33:35,406 --> 00:33:38,710
They don't want blood on our walls and doorsteps

220
00:33:38,715 --> 00:33:40,424
I can bargain with that

221
00:34:22,928 --> 00:34:24,010
Take me to him!

222
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,351
So you are giving us your city

223
00:34:33,221 --> 00:34:34,542
you offer me no bread

224
00:34:40,372 --> 00:34:41,454
I understand

225
00:34:42,712 --> 00:34:43,897
You may decide to kill me

226
00:35:19,037 --> 00:35:20,392
Say what you have come to say

227
00:35:25,354 --> 00:35:31,177
I saw your fires, the men around them

228
00:35:31,202 --> 00:35:35,977
and I know what power you put into them

229
00:35:39,456 --> 00:35:41,415
We can no longer resist Muhammad

230
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,653
Now if you agree 

231
00:35:45,571 --> 00:35:47,326
you dare to come here and ask for conditions

232
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:52,077
Isn't it yet time enough for you to recognize who Muhammad is?

233
00:35:54,595 --> 00:35:58,058
Muhammad, there is still doubt in my heart

234
00:35:59,274 --> 00:36:01,393
If I were to cut off your head, it would remove all your doubts

235
00:36:01,446 --> 00:36:02,733
Khalid,

236
00:36:02,782 --> 00:36:05,107
there is no composion in religion

237
00:36:05,155 --> 00:36:09,211
A man may take many years
or only need minutes

238
00:36:09,265 --> 00:36:12,627
its god who decides the time!

239
00:36:14,345 --> 00:36:16,066
So respect his doubts

240
00:36:22,233 --> 00:36:27,325
You're a black slave, you have the best school

241
00:36:30,654 --> 00:36:32,545
I am only what God has given me

242
00:36:34,229 --> 00:36:35,813
Yes

243
00:36:38,641 --> 00:36:40,327
The Gods that I worshipped,

244
00:36:41,816 --> 00:36:43,069
have never been in use

245
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,250
It would have helped me

246
00:36:52,877 --> 00:37:03,429
I require no composion.
There is one God,

247
00:37:07,815 --> 00:37:11,507
and you are the messenger of god.
Now, let me go.

248
00:38:27,686 --> 00:38:28,939
get inside

249
00:41:13,376 --> 00:41:17,911
No doors may be broken down,
nothing plondered, nothing seized

250
00:41:17,921 --> 00:41:22,672
no one abused, all behind closed doors are safe

251
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:26,162
All in hAbu Sufian's house are safe

252
00:41:26,209 --> 00:41:29,672
All by the side of Kabbalah are safe

253
00:41:37,437 --> 00:41:42,269
At least, he kept his word,
they haven't forced any door

254
00:41:42,317 --> 00:41:47,114
He's stolen hearts, not walls.
Its a permanent victory

255
00:41:48,833 --> 00:41:50,257
I dread going out

256
00:41:51,873 --> 00:41:55,531
we must... we must in the end

257
00:41:58,256 --> 00:41:59,681
were we so wrong?

258
00:42:01,633 --> 00:42:08,675
The way we lived, yes. that was wrong
we were trapped in our own faults

259
00:42:09,987 --> 00:42:11,411
our gods were less than us

260
00:42:12,694 --> 00:42:17,525
Now there he is, making his entrance to the Kabbaah

261
00:44:04,513 --> 00:44:09,105
In the name of god, most gracious, most merciful

262
00:44:11,464 --> 00:44:15,793
God gave this house to Abraham to be a sacred place,

263
00:44:17,044 --> 00:44:22,046
worship no other God but Him 
and cleanse his house

264
00:46:41,717 --> 00:46:43,936
so it was

265
00:46:43,986 --> 00:46:50,492
Muhammad took no revenge and allowed all.
He declared Mecca a holy place

266
00:46:50,536 --> 00:46:54,296
Noone may shed blood
or cut down a tree,

267
00:46:54,346 --> 00:46:57,468
or kill a living thing in Mecca

268
00:46:58,858 --> 00:46:59,644
Soon,

269
00:46:59,693 --> 00:47:05,528
all Arabia was converted not only to the new worship
but to the new laws, manners,

270
00:47:05,575 --> 00:47:07,990
attitudes contained in Islam

271
00:47:08,047 --> 00:47:15,682
The Prophet had lived to see his work done,
and now he began to feel the nearness of death

272
00:47:17,305 --> 00:47:19,526
One great act of his Prophet would remain

273
00:47:19,577 --> 00:47:22,129
the setting of its seal

274
00:47:22,184 --> 00:47:26,241
He called the people to him
and he spoke for the last time

275
00:47:26,295 --> 00:47:30,693
His message was to surrender to god
and humanity to man

276
00:47:30,739 --> 00:47:35,433
''Oh, mankind! Listen well!

277
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:38,014
I may not be with you much longer

278
00:47:38,058 --> 00:47:42,456
the weak among you
feed them and watch what you eat

279
00:47:42,503 --> 00:47:44,793
Dress them as you are dressed,

280
00:47:44,842 --> 00:47:49,126
you will meet your god 
and he will call you 

281
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:50,440
to count your actions

282
00:47:50,524 --> 00:47:55,822
Let those who are present warn those who are absent

283
00:47:57,274 --> 00:48:00,669
You are all are descendant from Adam
and the best among you

284
00:48:00,682 --> 00:48:05,707
is he who most regards god

285
00:48:05,728 --> 00:48:12,302
Think deeply about what I say.
Let all your feuds be abolished

286
00:48:12,346 --> 00:48:15,616
you must know that every Muslim

287
00:48:15,654 --> 00:48:20,212
is the brother of every other Muslim
and all Muslims are brothers of one-another

288
00:48:20,232 --> 00:48:23,855
Between Muslims, there are no races and no tribes 

289
00:48:23,874 --> 00:48:30,210
Not must you take anything from your brother
except what is given freely

290
00:48:31,361 --> 00:48:35,189
Do not oppress and do not be oppressed

291
00:48:37,175 --> 00:48:38,121
O my people!

292
00:48:38,178 --> 00:48:40,331
I'm but a man,

293
00:48:40,384 --> 00:48:47,723
It may be that the angel of death will visit me soon
and death will overtake me

294
00:48:49,306 --> 00:48:50,798
But I have left you a book,

295
00:48:50,843 --> 00:48:52,826
revealed by god,

296
00:48:52,883 --> 00:48:57,441
The Qur'an, which is light and guidance

297
00:48:59,031 --> 00:49:04,090
Now he repeated to the people
the final repetition of the Qur'an,

298
00:49:04,111 --> 00:49:05,660
the sea of determination

299
00:49:05,682 --> 00:49:08,735
not Muhammad's words, but god's word

300
00:49:08,789 --> 00:49:13,153
''This day I have perfected your religion for you

301
00:49:13,201 --> 00:49:15,628
and completed my favour to you

302
00:49:15,674 --> 00:49:19,366
and I have chosen for you Islam as your religion''

303
00:49:22,357 --> 00:49:24,420
ON June the 8th  632

304
00:49:24,463 --> 00:49:26,855
in his 63rd year

305
00:49:26,903 --> 00:49:29,329
Muhammad died

306
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:32,873
Many of his followers
could not believe the fact

307
00:49:32,918 --> 00:49:36,040
How can such a man die?

308
00:49:36,093 --> 00:49:41,027
But Abu Bakr, the Prophet's friend
stood up in the mosque:

309
00:49:41,072 --> 00:49:43,555
"If anyone worships Muhammad,

310
00:49:43,612 --> 00:49:45,936
Let him know that Muhammad is dead

311
00:49:45,984 --> 00:49:49,106
but who worships god

312
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:53,751
Let him know that god is alive and can not die''

313
00:49:58,216 --> 00:50:01,976
They buried Muhammad beside his mosque in Medina

314
00:50:02,025 --> 00:50:07,084
But the religion he preached
found its place in the heart of man

315
00:50:07,138 --> 00:50:11,194
It endured. It multiplied.

316
00:50:13,722 --> 00:50:16,651
Still to Mecca, they come, the mankind

317
00:50:16,696 --> 00:50:20,490
The people of Islam dressed in their pilgrim white

318
00:50:20,539 --> 00:50:23,433
all equal before god,

319
00:50:26,321 --> 00:50:33,921
all united in this place of crowd.
Each individual soul joined in a community of worship...

"ONE GOD"
