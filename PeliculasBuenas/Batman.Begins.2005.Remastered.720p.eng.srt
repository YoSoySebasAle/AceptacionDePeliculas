1
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,111
Rachel, let me see.

2
00:00:57,201 --> 00:01:00,329
- Can I see?
- Finders keepers. And I found it.

3
00:01:00,495 --> 00:01:02,039
In my garden.

4
00:01:03,749 --> 00:01:05,584
Finders keepers.

5
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:14,051
Bruce?

6
00:01:19,056 --> 00:01:20,766
Bruce?

7
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:25,562
Mom! Mr. Alfred!

8
00:01:48,502 --> 00:01:50,671
Did you have dream?

9
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:53,006
Nightmare.

10
00:01:57,386 --> 00:01:58,845
Worse than this place?

11
00:02:20,867 --> 00:02:22,828
They are going to fight you.

12
00:02:23,203 --> 00:02:24,830
- Again?
- Until they kill you.

13
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,834
Can they kill me before breakfast?

14
00:02:31,211 --> 00:02:34,047
You are in hell, little man.

15
00:02:37,342 --> 00:02:40,137
And I am the devil.

16
00:02:43,515 --> 00:02:44,975
You're not the devil.

17
00:02:45,142 --> 00:02:46,518
You're practice.

18
00:03:29,978 --> 00:03:31,271
Solitary.

19
00:03:31,438 --> 00:03:33,357
- Why?
- For protection.

20
00:03:34,066 --> 00:03:36,401
- I don't need protection.
- Protection for them.

21
00:03:40,072 --> 00:03:42,074
Get in.

22
00:03:45,952 --> 00:03:48,288
Are you so
desperate to fight criminals...

23
00:03:48,455 --> 00:03:50,957
...that you lock yourself in
to take them on one at a time?

24
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:56,088
Actually, there were seven of them.

25
00:03:56,254 --> 00:03:58,548
I counted six, Mr. Wayne.

26
00:04:02,302 --> 00:04:03,553
How do you know my name?

27
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,807
The world is too small for someone
like Bruce Wayne to disappear...

28
00:04:06,973 --> 00:04:09,267
...no matter how deep
he chooses to sink.

29
00:04:09,434 --> 00:04:10,602
Who are you?

30
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:13,939
My name is merely Ducard,
but I speak for Ra's al Ghul...

31
00:04:14,106 --> 00:04:17,734
...a man greatly feared
by the criminal underworld.

32
00:04:17,901 --> 00:04:19,486
A man who can offer you a path.

33
00:04:20,404 --> 00:04:22,906
What makes you think I need a path?

34
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:25,909
Someone like you
is only here by choice.

35
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:28,453
You have been exploring
the criminal fraternity...

36
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,081
...but whatever
your original intentions...

37
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,127
...you have become truly lost.

38
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:40,465
And what path can Ra's al Ghul offer?

39
00:04:40,632 --> 00:04:44,636
The path of a man
who shares his hatred of evil...

40
00:04:44,803 --> 00:04:48,014
...and wishes to serve true justice.

41
00:04:48,473 --> 00:04:50,600
The path of the League of Shadows.

42
00:04:53,687 --> 00:04:55,981
- You're vigilantes.
- No, no, no.

43
00:04:56,148 --> 00:05:00,318
A vigilante is just a man lost in
the scramble for his own gratification.

44
00:05:00,485 --> 00:05:04,156
He can be destroyed or locked up.

45
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:10,328
But if you make yourself more
than just a man...

46
00:05:10,495 --> 00:05:13,498
...if you devote yourself to an ideal...

47
00:05:13,665 --> 00:05:16,168
...and if they can't stop you...

48
00:05:16,543 --> 00:05:19,004
...then you become
something else entirely.

49
00:05:20,672 --> 00:05:22,215
Which is?

50
00:05:22,716 --> 00:05:25,677
Legend, Mr. Wayne.

51
00:05:27,012 --> 00:05:28,638
Tomorrow, you will be released.

52
00:05:28,805 --> 00:05:32,225
If you are bored of brawling with thieves
and want to achieve something...

53
00:05:32,392 --> 00:05:35,854
...there is a rare blue flower
that grows on the eastern slopes.

54
00:05:36,021 --> 00:05:37,689
Pick one of these flowers.

55
00:05:37,856 --> 00:05:40,817
If you can carry it
to the top of the mountain...

56
00:05:40,984 --> 00:05:43,904
...you may find what you were
looking for in the first place.

57
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,823
And what was I looking for?

58
00:05:48,533 --> 00:05:50,494
Only you can know that.

59
00:06:57,185 --> 00:07:01,273
You turn back. You go back.

60
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,884
Ra's al Ghul?

61
00:08:21,102 --> 00:08:22,687
Wait.

62
00:08:25,482 --> 00:08:27,192
What are you seeking?

63
00:08:27,901 --> 00:08:29,903
Iseeku.

64
00:08:31,446 --> 00:08:33,698
...the means to fight injustice.

65
00:08:34,074 --> 00:08:36,201
To turn fear...

66
00:08:36,534 --> 00:08:39,371
...against those
who prey on the fearful.

67
00:09:01,059 --> 00:09:04,145
To manipulate the fears in others...

68
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:08,400
...you must first master your own.

69
00:09:08,942 --> 00:09:10,735
Are you ready to begin?

70
00:09:11,653 --> 00:09:14,239
I can... I can barely stand.

71
00:09:14,406 --> 00:09:16,741
Death does not wait
for you to be ready!

72
00:09:16,908 --> 00:09:20,078
Death is not considerate or fair!

73
00:09:20,578 --> 00:09:25,208
And make no mistake,
here you face death.

74
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,422
Tiger.

75
00:09:32,048 --> 00:09:33,842
Jujitsu.

76
00:09:36,052 --> 00:09:37,095
Panther.

77
00:09:40,598 --> 00:09:42,934
You're skilled. But this is not a dance.

78
00:09:48,398 --> 00:09:49,941
And you are afraid.

79
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:54,779
But not of me.

80
00:09:58,241 --> 00:10:00,744
Tell us, Mr. Wayne...

81
00:10:05,248 --> 00:10:08,418
...what do you fear?

82
00:10:17,552 --> 00:10:18,970
Bruce?

83
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:24,142
It's okay. It's okay.

84
00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:25,810
You'll be okay.

85
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,480
Will we be needing
an ambulance, Master Wayne?

86
00:10:28,646 --> 00:10:31,524
No, I'll set the bone
and take him for an x-ray later.

87
00:10:31,691 --> 00:10:32,942
Very good, sir.

88
00:10:33,401 --> 00:10:37,113
- I'm very sorry, sir. I've told...
- Don't worry. It's fine.

89
00:10:39,407 --> 00:10:41,701
Took quite a fall,
didn't we, Master Bruce?

90
00:10:41,868 --> 00:10:43,036
And why do we fall?

91
00:10:43,203 --> 00:10:46,289
So we can learn to pick ourselves up.

92
00:10:50,043 --> 00:10:52,921
Just a little fall.
It's just a small fracture.

93
00:11:01,888 --> 00:11:03,723
The bats again?

94
00:11:06,893 --> 00:11:09,020
You know why they attacked you,
don't you?

95
00:11:09,521 --> 00:11:12,565
- They were afraid of you.
- Afraid of me?

96
00:11:12,732 --> 00:11:14,734
All creatures feel fear.

97
00:11:14,901 --> 00:11:16,236
Even the scary ones?

98
00:11:16,402 --> 00:11:18,238
Especially the scary ones.

99
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,406
I got something to show you.

100
00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:28,081
- You think your mother will like them?
- Yeah.

101
00:11:28,748 --> 00:11:30,917
- I think it's time to get up.
- Maybe.

102
00:11:31,084 --> 00:11:32,710
No going back to bed.

103
00:11:35,922 --> 00:11:38,049
Did you build this train, Dad?

104
00:11:38,216 --> 00:11:42,929
Gotham's been good to our family,
but the city's been suffering.

105
00:11:43,096 --> 00:11:46,599
People less fortunate than us
have been enduring very hard times.

106
00:11:46,766 --> 00:11:50,728
So we built a new, cheap, public
transportation system to unite the city.

107
00:11:50,895 --> 00:11:52,605
And at the center...

108
00:11:52,772 --> 00:11:54,607
...Wayne Tower.

109
00:11:54,774 --> 00:11:57,610
- Is that where you work?
- No, I work at the hospital.

110
00:11:57,777 --> 00:12:01,030
I leave the running of our company
to much better men.

111
00:12:01,197 --> 00:12:03,074
- Better?
- Well...

112
00:12:03,241 --> 00:12:05,451
...more interested men.

113
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:03,301
Can we go?

114
00:13:05,678 --> 00:13:07,180
Please.

115
00:13:07,764 --> 00:13:09,807
Okay. Let's go.

116
00:13:19,025 --> 00:13:21,861
- What's wrong, Bruce?
- No, no. It was me.

117
00:13:22,028 --> 00:13:24,197
I just needed some fresh air.

118
00:13:24,364 --> 00:13:27,533
A little bit of opera goes a long way.
Right, Bruce?

119
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:32,872
Come on. Let's go.

120
00:13:38,336 --> 00:13:40,046
Wallets, jewelry. Come on, fast.

121
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:41,714
- That's fine.
- Fast.

122
00:13:41,881 --> 00:13:43,383
Take it easy.

123
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:45,551
Take it easy.

124
00:13:46,386 --> 00:13:47,845
Here you go.

125
00:13:50,556 --> 00:13:53,393
It's fine. It's fine.

126
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,397
Now just take it and go.

127
00:13:57,563 --> 00:13:58,898
- I said, jewelry.
- Hey...

128
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:02,777
Thomas!

129
00:14:10,785 --> 00:14:12,412
Bruce.

130
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,416
It's okay.

131
00:14:19,585 --> 00:14:21,295
Don't be afraid.

132
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:54,912
Is this your father's?

133
00:14:56,456 --> 00:14:58,583
It's okay.

134
00:14:59,792 --> 00:15:01,419
Come here.

135
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,340
There you go.

136
00:15:09,469 --> 00:15:11,471
It's okay.

137
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:15,141
It's okay.

138
00:15:19,145 --> 00:15:20,646
Gordon.

139
00:15:28,738 --> 00:15:30,323
Hey.

140
00:15:30,948 --> 00:15:32,158
Good news.

141
00:15:33,618 --> 00:15:35,495
We got him, son.

142
00:15:56,182 --> 00:15:58,017
You're in excellent hands.

143
00:15:58,184 --> 00:15:59,852
We'll be watching the empire.

144
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:03,022
When you grow up,
it'll be waiting for you.

145
00:16:19,038 --> 00:16:22,166
I thought I might prepare a little supper.

146
00:16:27,338 --> 00:16:29,423
- Very well.
- Alfred?

147
00:16:33,386 --> 00:16:35,388
- Yes, Master Bruce?
- It was my fault, Alfred.

148
00:16:35,555 --> 00:16:37,223
- I made them leave the theater.
- No.

149
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,434
- If I hadn't gotten scared...
- It was nothing that you did.

150
00:16:41,561 --> 00:16:44,897
It was him, and him alone.

151
00:16:45,398 --> 00:16:46,899
Do you understand?

152
00:16:50,027 --> 00:16:53,072
I miss them, Alfred.
I miss them so much.

153
00:16:53,239 --> 00:16:55,241
So do I, Master Bruce.

154
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,911
So do I.

155
00:17:01,038 --> 00:17:04,041
And do you still feel
responsible for your parents' death?

156
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,252
My anger outweighs my guilt.

157
00:17:07,044 --> 00:17:08,421
Come.

158
00:17:13,092 --> 00:17:15,761
You have learned to bury
your guilt with anger.

159
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:19,015
I will teach you to confront it
and to face the truth.

160
00:17:21,517 --> 00:17:26,480
You know how to fight six men.
We can teach you how to engage 600.

161
00:17:27,732 --> 00:17:29,609
You know how to disappear.

162
00:17:29,775 --> 00:17:31,986
We can teach you
to become truly invisible.

163
00:17:33,613 --> 00:17:35,281
Invisible?

164
00:17:39,285 --> 00:17:43,956
The ninja understands that invisibility
is a matter of patience and agility.

165
00:17:56,928 --> 00:17:58,638
Always mind your surroundings.

166
00:18:01,807 --> 00:18:04,018
Ninjitsu employs explosive powders.

167
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,772
- As weapons?
- Or distractions.

168
00:18:07,939 --> 00:18:10,274
Theatricality and deception
are powerful agents.

169
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:13,778
You must become more than just a man
in the mind of your opponent.

170
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:18,157
- Who is he?
- He was a farmer.

171
00:18:18,324 --> 00:18:21,619
Then he tried to take his neighbor's land
and became a murderer.

172
00:18:21,786 --> 00:18:24,080
- Now he is a prisoner.
- What'll happen to him?

173
00:18:24,247 --> 00:18:26,666
Justice. Crime cannot be tolerated.

174
00:18:26,832 --> 00:18:30,795
Criminals thrive on the indulgence
of society's understanding.

175
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,677
Your parents' death was not your fault.

176
00:18:46,018 --> 00:18:47,228
It was your father's.

177
00:19:08,165 --> 00:19:11,002
Anger does not change the fact
that your father failed to act.

178
00:19:11,168 --> 00:19:13,379
- The man had a gun.
- Would that stop you?

179
00:19:14,171 --> 00:19:15,381
I've had training.

180
00:19:15,548 --> 00:19:17,383
The training is nothing!

181
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,218
Will is everything!

182
00:19:24,974 --> 00:19:26,851
The will to act.

183
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:37,862
Yield.

184
00:19:38,154 --> 00:19:39,572
You haven't beaten me.

185
00:19:39,739 --> 00:19:42,408
You have sacrificed sure footing
for a killing stroke.

186
00:19:50,082 --> 00:19:51,876
Rub your chest.

187
00:19:52,376 --> 00:19:55,254
Your arms will take care of themselves.

188
00:19:57,923 --> 00:19:59,550
You are stronger than your father.

189
00:20:00,217 --> 00:20:01,844
You didn't know my father.

190
00:20:02,011 --> 00:20:04,263
But I know the rage that drives you.

191
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,766
That impossible anger
strangling the grief...

192
00:20:06,932 --> 00:20:09,602
...until the memory
of your loved one is just...

193
00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:11,771
...poison in your veins.

194
00:20:11,937 --> 00:20:16,400
And one day, you catch yourself wishing
the person you loved had never existed...

195
00:20:17,777 --> 00:20:20,279
...so you'd be spared your pain.

196
00:20:23,282 --> 00:20:26,660
I wasn't always here in the mountains.

197
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,289
Once, I had a wife.

198
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,209
My great love.

199
00:20:34,377 --> 00:20:36,462
She was taken from me.

200
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:39,882
Like you, I was forced to learn
there are those without decency...

201
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:43,302
...who must be fought
without hesitation, without pity.

202
00:20:45,137 --> 00:20:47,473
Your anger gives you great power.

203
00:20:47,973 --> 00:20:51,477
But if you let it, it will destroy you...

204
00:20:52,061 --> 00:20:53,312
...as it almost did me.

205
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:56,941
- What stopped it?
- Vengeance.

206
00:20:57,149 --> 00:20:58,984
That's no help to me.

207
00:20:59,151 --> 00:21:00,986
Why, Bruce?

208
00:21:01,153 --> 00:21:03,823
Why could you not
avenge your parents?

209
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:11,122
Will you be heading back to Princeton
after the hearing, sir...

210
00:21:11,288 --> 00:21:13,958
...or can I persuade you to stay on
for a day or two?

211
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,335
I'm not heading back at all.

212
00:21:16,502 --> 00:21:18,587
- You don't like it there?
- I like it fine.

213
00:21:18,963 --> 00:21:21,757
They just don't feel the same way.

214
00:21:22,508 --> 00:21:26,178
- I've prepared the master bedroom.
- No.

215
00:21:26,345 --> 00:21:27,805
My room will be fine.

216
00:21:27,972 --> 00:21:30,683
With all due respect, sir,
Wayne Manor is your house.

217
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,685
No, Alfred, it's my father's house.

218
00:21:32,852 --> 00:21:35,020
- Your father is dead.
- This place is a mausoleum.

219
00:21:35,229 --> 00:21:38,274
If I have my way, I'll pull
the damn thing down brick by brick.

220
00:21:38,441 --> 00:21:42,528
This house, Master Wayne, has sheltered
six generations of your family.

221
00:21:42,695 --> 00:21:45,364
Why do you give a damn, Alfred?
It's not your family.

222
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,119
I give a damn because a good man
once made me responsible...

223
00:21:50,786 --> 00:21:52,955
...for what was most precious to him...

224
00:21:53,122 --> 00:21:55,374
...in the whole world.

225
00:21:57,334 --> 00:22:00,880
Miss Dawes has offered
to drive you to the hearing.

226
00:22:01,046 --> 00:22:03,048
She probably hopes
to talk you out of going.

227
00:22:03,257 --> 00:22:06,719
Should I just bury the past
out there with my parents, Alfred?

228
00:22:06,886 --> 00:22:09,972
I wouldn't presume to tell you
what to do with your past, sir.

229
00:22:10,139 --> 00:22:14,185
Just know that there are those of us who
care about what you do with your future.

230
00:22:15,561 --> 00:22:17,062
Haven't given up on me yet?

231
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,231
Never.

232
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,659
Alfred still keeps the condensed milk
on the top shelf.

233
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:13,953
Hasn't he noticed
you're tall enough to reach now?

234
00:23:14,286 --> 00:23:15,788
Old habits die hard, I guess.

235
00:23:15,955 --> 00:23:18,415
- Never used to stop us anyway.
- No, it didn't.

236
00:23:18,582 --> 00:23:20,459
How's your mom?

237
00:23:20,876 --> 00:23:23,128
She misses this place.

238
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,131
So do I.

239
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:27,800
Yeah.

240
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:30,970
But it's nothing without the people
who made it what it was.

241
00:23:31,136 --> 00:23:34,139
- Now there's only Alfred.
- And you.

242
00:23:34,306 --> 00:23:37,851
- I'm not staying, Rachel.
- You're just back for the hearing.

243
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,651
Bruce, I don't suppose there's any way
to convince you not to come.

244
00:23:45,985 --> 00:23:49,488
Someone at this proceeding...

245
00:23:50,155 --> 00:23:52,324
...should stand for my parents.

246
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:54,618
We all loved your parents, Bruce.

247
00:23:54,785 --> 00:23:57,997
- What Chill did is unforgivable.
- Then why is your boss letting him go?

248
00:23:59,373 --> 00:24:02,626
In prison, he shared a cell
with Carmine Falcone.

249
00:24:02,793 --> 00:24:06,463
He learned things, and he will testify
in exchange for early parole.

250
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:09,300
Rachel, this man killed my parents.

251
00:24:11,302 --> 00:24:13,012
I cannot let that pass.

252
00:24:13,178 --> 00:24:16,015
And I need you
to understand that, please.

253
00:24:17,808 --> 00:24:19,018
Okay.

254
00:24:20,102 --> 00:24:23,439
The depression hit working
people, like Mr. Chill, hardest of all.

255
00:24:23,606 --> 00:24:26,817
His crime was appalling, yes,
but it was motivated not by greed...

256
00:24:27,151 --> 00:24:28,819
...but by desperation.

257
00:24:28,986 --> 00:24:32,865
Given the 14 years served, as well as
his extraordinary level of cooperation...

258
00:24:33,032 --> 00:24:35,701
...with one of this office's
most important investigations...

259
00:24:35,868 --> 00:24:38,996
...we strongly endorse his petition
for early release.

260
00:24:39,997 --> 00:24:42,291
Mr. Chill?

261
00:24:45,878 --> 00:24:47,546
Your Honor...

262
00:24:48,422 --> 00:24:51,550
...not a day goes by that I don't wish
I could take back what I did.

263
00:24:54,178 --> 00:24:57,389
Sure, I was desperate,
like a lot of people back then...

264
00:24:57,556 --> 00:24:59,933
...but that don't change what I did.

265
00:25:03,562 --> 00:25:08,233
I gather there is a member
of the Wayne family here today.

266
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,694
Has he got anything to say?

267
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:28,253
- He's coming out the side!
- He's coming out the side, guys!

268
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,223
Bruce Wayne!

269
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:43,268
Joe! Hey, Joe!

270
00:25:43,435 --> 00:25:44,436
Falcone says hi.

271
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,865
Come on, Bruce.

272
00:25:57,241 --> 00:25:58,867
We don't need to see this.

273
00:25:59,618 --> 00:26:01,120
I do.

274
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:08,711
The DA couldn't understand
why Judge Faden insisted...

275
00:26:08,877 --> 00:26:10,295
...on making the hearing public.

276
00:26:10,504 --> 00:26:12,881
Falcone paid him off
to get Chill out in the open.

277
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:14,299
Maybe I should thank them.

278
00:26:14,508 --> 00:26:17,094
- You don't mean that.
- What if I do, Rachel?

279
00:26:17,261 --> 00:26:19,138
My parents deserved justice.

280
00:26:19,304 --> 00:26:22,266
You're not talking about justice.
You're talking about revenge.

281
00:26:22,433 --> 00:26:25,310
- Sometimes, they're the same.
- No, they're never the same.

282
00:26:25,477 --> 00:26:29,064
Justice is about harmony. Revenge is
about you making yourself feel better.

283
00:26:29,231 --> 00:26:32,526
- It's why we have an impartial system.
- Your system is broken.

284
00:26:39,616 --> 00:26:42,453
You care about justice?
Look beyond your own pain, Bruce.

285
00:26:42,828 --> 00:26:44,329
This city is rotting.

286
00:26:44,496 --> 00:26:47,291
They talk about the depression
as if it's history. It's not.

287
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:48,959
Things are worse than ever here.

288
00:26:49,126 --> 00:26:51,670
Falcone floods our streets
with crime and drugs...

289
00:26:51,837 --> 00:26:54,798
...preying on the desperate,
creating new Joe Chills every day.

290
00:26:54,965 --> 00:26:57,509
Falcone may not have killed
your parents, Bruce...

291
00:26:58,135 --> 00:27:00,637
...but he's destroying everything
that they stood for.

292
00:27:05,184 --> 00:27:08,061
You wanna thank him for that?
Here you go.

293
00:27:09,938 --> 00:27:12,983
We all know where to find him.
As long as he keeps the bad people rich...

294
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:15,277
...and the good people scared,
no one'll touch him.

295
00:27:15,444 --> 00:27:19,698
Good people like your parents, who'll
stand against injustice, they're gone.

296
00:27:19,865 --> 00:27:23,577
What chance does Gotham have
when the good people do nothing?

297
00:27:24,453 --> 00:27:27,873
- I'm not one of your good people, Rachel.
- What do you mean?

298
00:27:30,125 --> 00:27:33,170
All these years, I wanted to kill him.

299
00:27:33,962 --> 00:27:35,547
Now I can't.

300
00:27:51,396 --> 00:27:53,106
Your father would be ashamed of you.

301
00:28:36,608 --> 00:28:39,111
You're taller than you look
in the tabloids, Mr. Wayne.

302
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,446
No gun? I'm insulted.

303
00:28:44,616 --> 00:28:48,412
- You could've just sent a thank-you note.
- I didn't come here to thank you.

304
00:28:48,579 --> 00:28:51,290
I came to show you that
not everyone in Gotham's afraid of you.

305
00:28:51,456 --> 00:28:53,125
Only those who know me, kid.

306
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:55,961
Look around you.
You'll see two councilmen...

307
00:28:56,295 --> 00:28:59,131
...a union official,
couple off-duty cops...

308
00:28:59,548 --> 00:29:01,133
...and a judge.

309
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:05,637
I wouldn't have a second's hesitation of
blowing your head off in front of them.

310
00:29:05,804 --> 00:29:08,473
Now, that's power you can't buy.

311
00:29:09,141 --> 00:29:10,601
That's the power of fear.

312
00:29:10,976 --> 00:29:12,269
I'm not afraid of you.

313
00:29:12,436 --> 00:29:14,313
Because you think you got
nothing to lose.

314
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:16,148
But you haven't thought it through.

315
00:29:16,315 --> 00:29:19,443
You haven't thought about
your lady friend in the DA's office.

316
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:22,654
You haven't thought about
your old butler. Bang!

317
00:29:26,158 --> 00:29:28,493
People from your world...

318
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,996
...have so much to lose.

319
00:29:31,204 --> 00:29:35,500
Now, you think because your mommy
and your daddy got shot...

320
00:29:35,709 --> 00:29:38,670
...you know about the ugly side of life,
but you don't.

321
00:29:38,837 --> 00:29:40,964
You've never tasted desperate.

322
00:29:41,131 --> 00:29:43,675
You're... You're Bruce Wayne,
the prince of Gotham.

323
00:29:43,842 --> 00:29:47,262
You'd have to go 1000 miles to meet
someone who didn't know your name.

324
00:29:47,429 --> 00:29:51,683
So don't come here with your anger,
trying to prove something to yourself.

325
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:54,019
This is a world you'll never understand.

326
00:29:54,186 --> 00:29:56,188
And you always fear...

327
00:29:56,355 --> 00:29:58,815
...what you don't understand.

328
00:30:01,693 --> 00:30:03,028
All right.

329
00:30:10,702 --> 00:30:13,538
Yeah, you got spirit, kid.
I'll give you that.

330
00:30:13,705 --> 00:30:15,707
More than your old man anyway.

331
00:30:15,874 --> 00:30:20,170
In the joint, Chill told me about
the night he killed your parents.

332
00:30:20,337 --> 00:30:22,547
He said your father begged for mercy.

333
00:30:23,882 --> 00:30:25,676
Begged.

334
00:30:25,842 --> 00:30:27,219
Like a dog.

335
00:30:40,065 --> 00:30:41,858
Should've tipped better.

336
00:30:51,868 --> 00:30:53,704
- For what?
- Your jacket.

337
00:30:54,246 --> 00:30:55,872
Okay.

338
00:30:56,915 --> 00:31:00,419
Hey, hey, hey. Let me have it.
It's a nice coat.

339
00:31:00,585 --> 00:31:02,713
Be careful who sees you with that.

340
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:05,215
- They're gonna come looking for me.
- Who?

341
00:31:05,674 --> 00:31:07,384
Everyone.

342
00:31:09,678 --> 00:31:11,430
It's...

343
00:31:11,596 --> 00:31:13,598
It's a nice coat.

344
00:31:31,908 --> 00:31:36,288
<i>When you lived among
the criminals, did you start to pity them?</i>

345
00:31:36,455 --> 00:31:40,125
<i>The first time I stole
so that I wouldn't starve, yes.</i>

346
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:45,797
<i>I lost many assumptions about
the simple nature of right and wrong.</i>

347
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,134
<i>And when I traveled...</i>

348
00:31:49,342 --> 00:31:52,054
<i>...l learned the fear before a crime...</i>

349
00:31:52,804 --> 00:31:55,390
<i>...and the thrill of success.</i>

350
00:31:57,267 --> 00:31:59,144
<i>But I never became one of them.</i>

351
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,108
Fool. What do I care
what your name is? You're a criminal.

352
00:32:05,275 --> 00:32:06,943
I'm not a criminal

353
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:09,279
Tell that to the guy who owned these.

354
00:32:11,364 --> 00:32:14,493
<i>You've traveled the world
to understand the criminal mind...</i>

355
00:32:14,659 --> 00:32:15,952
...and conquer your fears.

356
00:32:17,996 --> 00:32:22,167
But a criminal is not complicated.

357
00:32:22,334 --> 00:32:25,670
And what you really fear
is inside yourself.

358
00:32:25,837 --> 00:32:28,340
You fear your own power.

359
00:32:28,507 --> 00:32:29,841
You fear your anger...

360
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:34,513
...the drive to do great
or terrible things.

361
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:38,183
Now you must journey inwards.

362
00:32:41,937 --> 00:32:44,022
You are ready.

363
00:32:45,023 --> 00:32:46,441
Breathe.

364
00:32:55,992 --> 00:32:57,869
Breathe.

365
00:33:02,874 --> 00:33:04,709
Breathe in your fears.

366
00:33:07,337 --> 00:33:08,380
Face them.

367
00:33:09,881 --> 00:33:12,676
To conquer fear,
you must become fear.

368
00:33:12,843 --> 00:33:16,221
You must bask in the fear
of other men.

369
00:33:17,681 --> 00:33:21,059
And men fear most
what they cannot see.

370
00:33:38,326 --> 00:33:41,204
You have to become a terrible thought.

371
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:46,918
A wraith.

372
00:33:52,674 --> 00:33:55,051
You have to become an idea!

373
00:34:01,933 --> 00:34:04,978
Feel terror cloud your senses.

374
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,941
Feel its power to distort.

375
00:34:10,901 --> 00:34:13,111
To control.

376
00:34:16,198 --> 00:34:19,993
And know that this power
can be yours.

377
00:34:32,547 --> 00:34:35,217
Embrace your worst fear.

378
00:34:42,224 --> 00:34:44,517
Become one with the darkness.

379
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:06,039
Focus.

380
00:35:06,331 --> 00:35:08,500
Concentrate.

381
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:10,794
Master your senses.

382
00:35:38,863 --> 00:35:41,324
You cannot leave any sign.

383
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,867
I haven't.

384
00:35:51,209 --> 00:35:53,211
Impressive.

385
00:36:02,304 --> 00:36:04,389
We have purged your fear.

386
00:36:05,557 --> 00:36:07,183
You are ready to lead these men.

387
00:36:07,350 --> 00:36:10,895
You are ready to become a member
of the League of Shadows.

388
00:36:13,523 --> 00:36:17,694
But first, you must demonstrate
your commitment to justice.

389
00:36:34,419 --> 00:36:35,754
No.

390
00:36:37,255 --> 00:36:38,548
I'm no executioner.

391
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:42,761
Your compassion is
a weakness your enemies will not share.

392
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:45,430
That's why it's so important.

393
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,432
It separates us from them.

394
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,934
You want to fight criminals.
This man is a murderer.

395
00:36:50,101 --> 00:36:52,020
- This man should be tried.
- By whom?

396
00:36:52,228 --> 00:36:53,772
Corrupt bureaucrats?

397
00:36:53,938 --> 00:36:56,441
Criminals mock society's laws.

398
00:36:56,649 --> 00:36:58,943
You know this better than most.

399
00:36:59,778 --> 00:37:02,447
You cannot lead these men...

400
00:37:02,614 --> 00:37:06,618
...unless you are prepared to do
what is necessary to defeat evil.

401
00:37:07,202 --> 00:37:09,621
And where would I be leading
these men?

402
00:37:10,163 --> 00:37:11,456
Gotham.

403
00:37:11,623 --> 00:37:13,625
As Gotham's favored son...

404
00:37:13,792 --> 00:37:18,171
...you will be ideally placed
to strike at the heart of criminality.

405
00:37:18,546 --> 00:37:22,300
- How?
- Gotham's time has come.

406
00:37:22,467 --> 00:37:25,804
Like Constantinople or Rome before it...

407
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:30,141
...the city has become a breeding ground
for suffering and injustice.

408
00:37:30,308 --> 00:37:33,978
It is beyond saving
and must be allowed to die.

409
00:37:34,145 --> 00:37:39,317
This is the most important function
of the League of Shadows.

410
00:37:39,609 --> 00:37:42,695
It is one we've performed for centuries.

411
00:37:42,987 --> 00:37:44,781
Gotham...

412
00:37:44,948 --> 00:37:47,826
...must be destroyed.

413
00:37:51,162 --> 00:37:52,664
You can't believe in this.

414
00:37:52,831 --> 00:37:57,419
Ra's al Ghul rescued us from
the darkest corners of our own hearts.

415
00:37:57,585 --> 00:38:02,006
What he asks in return is the courage
to do what is necessary.

416
00:38:02,215 --> 00:38:05,510
I will go back to Gotham
and I will fight men like this...

417
00:38:05,718 --> 00:38:08,304
...but I will not become an executioner.

418
00:38:08,471 --> 00:38:10,014
Bruce, please.

419
00:38:10,181 --> 00:38:13,017
For your own sake,
there is no turning back.

420
00:38:45,383 --> 00:38:47,886
- What are you doing?
- What's necessary, my friend.

421
00:41:04,355 --> 00:41:07,483
I will tell him you saved his life.

422
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:28,713
Master Wayne,
you've been gone a long time.

423
00:41:28,921 --> 00:41:31,215
- Yes, I have.
- You look very fashionable.

424
00:41:32,717 --> 00:41:34,218
Apart from the mud.

425
00:41:34,469 --> 00:41:37,138
Are you coming back to Gotham
for long, sir?

426
00:41:37,305 --> 00:41:38,556
As long as it takes.

427
00:41:38,723 --> 00:41:40,224
I want to show the people...

428
00:41:40,391 --> 00:41:43,811
...their city doesn't belong
to the criminals and the corrupt.

429
00:41:43,978 --> 00:41:47,190
In the depression, your father nearly
bankrupted Wayne Enterprises...

430
00:41:47,357 --> 00:41:48,566
...combating poverty.

431
00:41:48,733 --> 00:41:53,237
He believed his example could inspire
the wealthy of Gotham to save their city.

432
00:41:53,571 --> 00:41:55,198
Did it?

433
00:41:56,324 --> 00:41:57,742
In a way.

434
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:01,037
Their murder shocked the wealthy
and the powerful into action.

435
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:06,084
People need dramatic examples
to shake them out of apathy.

436
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,919
I can't do that as Bruce Wayne.

437
00:42:08,086 --> 00:42:09,587
Asa man...

438
00:42:09,754 --> 00:42:12,215
...I'm flesh and blood,
I can be ignored, destroyed.

439
00:42:12,382 --> 00:42:14,258
But as a symbol...

440
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,429
As a symbol, I can be incorruptible.

441
00:42:18,596 --> 00:42:21,224
- I can be everlasting.
- What symbol?

442
00:42:21,766 --> 00:42:24,435
Something elemental...

443
00:42:24,602 --> 00:42:26,270
...something terrifying.

444
00:42:26,437 --> 00:42:28,564
I assume that as you take on
the underworld...

445
00:42:28,731 --> 00:42:33,861
...this symbol is a persona to protect
those you care about from reprisals?

446
00:42:34,028 --> 00:42:35,405
You're thinking about Rachel?

447
00:42:35,571 --> 00:42:37,949
Actually, sir, I was thinking of myself.

448
00:42:39,951 --> 00:42:41,703
Have you told anyone I'm coming back?

449
00:42:41,911 --> 00:42:46,124
I couldn't figure the legal ramifications
of bringing you back from the dead.

450
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:48,126
- Dead?
- You've been gone seven years.

451
00:42:48,292 --> 00:42:49,627
You had me declared dead?

452
00:42:49,794 --> 00:42:52,630
Actually, it was Mr. Earle.
He's taking the company public.

453
00:42:52,797 --> 00:42:55,091
He wanted to liquidate
your majority shareholding.

454
00:42:55,299 --> 00:42:57,635
Those shares are worth
quite a bit of money.

455
00:42:57,802 --> 00:43:00,513
Well, it's a good thing
I left everything to you, then.

456
00:43:01,055 --> 00:43:02,640
Quite so, sir.

457
00:43:02,807 --> 00:43:06,602
And you can borrow the Rolls, if you like.
Just bring it back with a full tank.

458
00:43:16,654 --> 00:43:21,325
In my opinion, Mr. Zsaz is as much
a danger to himself as to others...

459
00:43:21,743 --> 00:43:26,330
...and prison is probably not the best
environment for his rehabilitation.

460
00:43:28,624 --> 00:43:31,169
- Dr. Crane.
- Miss Dawes.

461
00:43:31,335 --> 00:43:34,672
You think a man who butchers people
for the mob doesn't belong in jail?

462
00:43:34,839 --> 00:43:37,508
I would hardly have testified to that
otherwise, would I?

463
00:43:37,675 --> 00:43:40,762
This is the third of Falcone's thugs
you've had declared insane...

464
00:43:40,928 --> 00:43:42,346
...and moved into your asylum.

465
00:43:42,555 --> 00:43:47,185
The work offered by organized crime
must have an attraction to the insane.

466
00:43:48,686 --> 00:43:50,688
Or the corrupt.

467
00:43:52,982 --> 00:43:54,567
Mr. Finch.

468
00:43:54,859 --> 00:43:56,694
You should check
with Miss Dawes here...

469
00:43:56,861 --> 00:44:01,199
...just what implications your office
has authorized her to make. If any.

470
00:44:05,203 --> 00:44:07,538
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing, Carl?

471
00:44:07,705 --> 00:44:09,081
Looking out for you.

472
00:44:11,584 --> 00:44:14,504
Falcone has half the city
bought and paid for.

473
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:16,714
- Drop it.
- How can you say that?

474
00:44:16,881 --> 00:44:20,551
Because as much as I care about
getting Falcone, I care more about you.

475
00:44:20,718 --> 00:44:22,053
That's sweet.

476
00:44:27,475 --> 00:44:29,852
We've been through all that.

477
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,380
Blessed bat again, sir.

478
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:00,258
They nest somewhere in the grounds.

479
00:46:58,125 --> 00:47:00,836
No more favors.
Someone is sniffing around.

480
00:47:01,003 --> 00:47:03,965
Hey, I scratch your back,
you scratch mine, doc.

481
00:47:04,131 --> 00:47:05,508
I'm bringing in the shipments.

482
00:47:06,217 --> 00:47:07,385
We are paying you for that.

483
00:47:07,551 --> 00:47:10,054
Maybe money isn't as interesting
to me as favors.

484
00:47:12,556 --> 00:47:17,395
I am more than aware that you are
not intimidated by me, Mr. Falcone.

485
00:47:17,561 --> 00:47:20,648
But you know who I'm working for,
and when he gets here...

486
00:47:20,815 --> 00:47:22,733
He... He's coming to Gotham?

487
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,360
Yes, he is.

488
00:47:24,527 --> 00:47:26,988
And when he gets here,
he's not going to wanna hear...

489
00:47:27,154 --> 00:47:32,243
...that you've endangered our operation
just to get your thugs out of jail time.

490
00:47:33,244 --> 00:47:36,580
- Who's bothering you?
- There's a girl at the DA's office.

491
00:47:37,081 --> 00:47:38,874
- We'll buy her off.
- Not this one.

492
00:47:40,001 --> 00:47:41,919
Idealist, huh?

493
00:47:42,086 --> 00:47:43,796
Well, there's an answer to that too.

494
00:47:44,171 --> 00:47:47,091
- I don't want to know.
- Yes, you do.

495
00:47:51,303 --> 00:47:54,765
No, we are showing
very healthy growth in these sectors.

496
00:47:54,932 --> 00:47:58,102
I don't think Thomas Wayne would have
viewed heavy-arms manufacture...

497
00:47:58,269 --> 00:48:00,438
...as a suitable cornerstone
for our business.

498
00:48:01,814 --> 00:48:05,609
Well, that's 20 years ago, Fredericks.

499
00:48:05,943 --> 00:48:09,113
I think after 20 years
we can allow ourselves...

500
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,116
...to stop thinking about what
Thomas Wayne would have done.

501
00:48:12,283 --> 00:48:14,118
Good morning, Mr. Earle's office.

502
00:48:14,326 --> 00:48:17,621
Yes, he's confirmed for
the dinner tomorrow evening.

503
00:48:17,788 --> 00:48:21,125
Good morning.
I'm here to see Mr. Earle.

504
00:48:21,292 --> 00:48:22,793
Name?

505
00:48:23,252 --> 00:48:24,920
Bruce Wayne.

506
00:48:26,797 --> 00:48:30,301
Thomas would probably not
have taken the company public.

507
00:48:30,468 --> 00:48:34,555
But that is what we,
as responsible managers, are going to do.

508
00:48:35,264 --> 00:48:36,807
Jessica?

509
00:48:37,892 --> 00:48:40,436
Jessica? Where are you?

510
00:48:40,603 --> 00:48:44,857
- Eye on the ball, and...
- Why is no one answering the phone?

511
00:48:45,483 --> 00:48:48,652
It's Wayne Enterprises, Mr. Earle.
I'm sure they'll call back.

512
00:48:48,986 --> 00:48:51,489
Bruce? You're supposed to be dead.

513
00:48:51,655 --> 00:48:53,657
I'm sorry to disappoint.

514
00:48:53,824 --> 00:48:56,494
- I need you to take a look at this.
- Have you seen him yet?

515
00:48:56,827 --> 00:48:58,370
- Who?
- Wayne.

516
00:48:58,662 --> 00:49:00,790
It's been all over the news.
He's back.

517
00:49:04,668 --> 00:49:07,630
I'm sure you realize
I can't stop the big machine.

518
00:49:07,797 --> 00:49:09,006
Too many wheels turning.

519
00:49:09,173 --> 00:49:11,175
- We're going public.
- I understand.

520
00:49:11,675 --> 00:49:14,512
And I'll be handsomely rewarded
for my shares.

521
00:49:14,678 --> 00:49:17,181
I'm not looking to interfere.

522
00:49:17,681 --> 00:49:19,809
- I am looking for a job.
- Oh?

523
00:49:19,975 --> 00:49:23,020
I just want to get to know the company
that my family built.

524
00:49:23,354 --> 00:49:25,106
Any ideas where you would start?

525
00:49:25,606 --> 00:49:27,983
Applied Sciences caught my eye.

526
00:49:28,359 --> 00:49:30,027
Fox's department.

527
00:49:30,194 --> 00:49:32,196
I'll let him know you're coming.

528
00:49:33,155 --> 00:49:35,908
You look like him. Your dad.

529
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,370
You're the only one left
of the Wayne family.

530
00:49:39,537 --> 00:49:43,499
This is where you belong.
Welcome home.

531
00:49:44,083 --> 00:49:48,337
Environmental procedures,
defense projects, consumer products.

532
00:49:48,838 --> 00:49:51,549
All prototypes. None in production.

533
00:49:51,715 --> 00:49:54,385
- On any level whatsoever.
- None?

534
00:49:55,386 --> 00:49:57,221
What did they tell you this place was?

535
00:49:57,388 --> 00:49:59,431
They didn't tell me anything.

536
00:50:01,892 --> 00:50:05,354
Earle told me exactly what it was
when he sent me down here.

537
00:50:05,813 --> 00:50:07,231
Dead end.

538
00:50:07,439 --> 00:50:10,734
Place to keep me from causing
the board any more trouble.

539
00:50:11,735 --> 00:50:13,237
Come on.

540
00:50:13,404 --> 00:50:15,865
- You were on the board?
- When your father ran things.

541
00:50:16,031 --> 00:50:17,908
- You knew my father?
- Oh, yeah.

542
00:50:18,075 --> 00:50:19,743
Helped him build his train.

543
00:50:20,327 --> 00:50:21,954
Here we are.

544
00:50:25,583 --> 00:50:27,251
Kevlar utility harness.

545
00:50:27,585 --> 00:50:29,587
Gas-powered, magnetic grapple gun.

546
00:50:29,753 --> 00:50:32,089
The 350-pound test monofilament.

547
00:50:35,426 --> 00:50:37,595
Wonderful project, your dad's train.

548
00:50:38,095 --> 00:50:42,725
Routed it right into Wayne Tower,
along with the water and power utilities.

549
00:50:42,892 --> 00:50:46,103
Kind of made Wayne Tower
the unofficial center of Gotham City.

550
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:48,939
Of course, Earle let it go to rot.
Here we are.

551
00:50:50,774 --> 00:50:52,943
Nomex survival suit
for advanced infantry.

552
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:55,905
Kevlar biweave, reinforced joints.

553
00:50:56,238 --> 00:50:58,616
- Tear-resistant?
- This sucker will stop a knife.

554
00:50:58,782 --> 00:51:00,951
- Bulletproof?
- Anything but a straight shot.

555
00:51:01,118 --> 00:51:04,038
- Why didn't they put it into production?
- Bean counters didn't think...

556
00:51:04,205 --> 00:51:06,582
...a soldier's life was worth 300 grand.

557
00:51:07,625 --> 00:51:11,128
So, what's your interest in it,
Mr. Wayne?

558
00:51:11,795 --> 00:51:13,297
I want to borrow it.

559
00:51:13,464 --> 00:51:15,257
For spelunking.

560
00:51:16,133 --> 00:51:17,426
Spelunking?

561
00:51:17,593 --> 00:51:19,303
Yeah, you know, cave diving?

562
00:51:20,596 --> 00:51:23,265
You expecting to run into
much gunfire in these caves?

563
00:51:25,601 --> 00:51:28,812
Look, I'd rather Mr. Earle
didn't know about me borrowing...

564
00:51:29,021 --> 00:51:30,272
Mr. Wayne...

565
00:51:30,481 --> 00:51:32,399
...the way I see it...

566
00:51:32,816 --> 00:51:35,319
...all this stuff is yours anyway.

567
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,783
Okay. Give it a try.

568
00:51:44,912 --> 00:51:46,163
Charming.

569
00:51:48,999 --> 00:51:50,793
At least you'll have company.

570
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:56,674
This must be the lowest foundation
of the southeast wing.

571
00:52:09,144 --> 00:52:13,315
Your great-great-grandfather was
involved in the Underground Railroad...

572
00:52:13,482 --> 00:52:16,485
...secretly transporting freed slaves
to the North...

573
00:52:16,652 --> 00:52:20,364
...and I suspect these caverns
came in handy.

574
00:52:33,043 --> 00:52:35,212
Alfred! Come up here!

575
00:52:35,379 --> 00:52:38,382
I can see everything all right
from down here, sir, thank you.

576
00:52:58,402 --> 00:53:01,071
We order the main part
of this cowl from Singapore.

577
00:53:01,238 --> 00:53:02,740
Via a dummy corporation.

578
00:53:02,906 --> 00:53:04,742
Indeed. And then, quite separately...

579
00:53:04,908 --> 00:53:09,872
...we place an order
to a Chinese company for these.

580
00:53:10,414 --> 00:53:13,375
- Put it together ourselves.
- Precisely.

581
00:53:13,542 --> 00:53:17,588
They'll have to be large orders,
to avoid suspicion.

582
00:53:17,755 --> 00:53:20,257
- How large?
- Say 10,000.

583
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,721
- Well, at least we'll have spares.
- Yes.

584
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:44,907
Don't suppose you want a taste.

585
00:53:45,074 --> 00:53:48,243
I just keep offering,
thinking maybe someday you'll get wise.

586
00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:50,579
There's nothing wise
in what you do, Flass.

587
00:53:50,746 --> 00:53:54,124
Well, Jimbo, you don't take the taste,
makes us guys nervous.

588
00:53:54,291 --> 00:53:56,126
I'm no rat.

589
00:53:58,879 --> 00:54:02,591
In a town this bent,
who's thereto rat to anyway?

590
00:54:32,287 --> 00:54:34,415
Don't turn around.

591
00:54:34,998 --> 00:54:38,085
You're a good cop.
One of the few.

592
00:54:38,752 --> 00:54:39,837
What do you want?

593
00:54:40,003 --> 00:54:43,173
Carmine Falcone brings
in shipments of drugs every week.

594
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:45,175
Nobody takes him down. Why?

595
00:54:46,593 --> 00:54:48,720
He's paid up with the right people.

596
00:54:49,012 --> 00:54:51,807
What will it take to bring him down?

597
00:54:52,516 --> 00:54:54,935
Leverage on Judge Faden...

598
00:54:55,644 --> 00:54:58,021
...and a DA brave enough
to prosecute.

599
00:54:58,439 --> 00:55:00,023
Rachel Dawes.

600
00:55:00,649 --> 00:55:01,733
Who are you?

601
00:55:02,192 --> 00:55:03,819
Watch for my sign.

602
00:55:06,488 --> 00:55:08,532
You're just one man?

603
00:55:08,949 --> 00:55:10,367
Now we're two.

604
00:55:12,494 --> 00:55:14,037
We?

605
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,472
Freeze!

606
00:55:48,655 --> 00:55:50,574
What the hell was that?

607
00:55:53,494 --> 00:55:54,703
Just some nut.

608
00:55:58,081 --> 00:56:00,918
Well, what is it today?
More spelunking?

609
00:56:01,084 --> 00:56:03,587
No. Today it's BASE-jumping.

610
00:56:04,171 --> 00:56:05,797
BASE-jumping.

611
00:56:06,381 --> 00:56:08,926
- That like parachuting?
- Kind of.

612
00:56:10,093 --> 00:56:12,930
Do you have any lightweight fabrics?

613
00:56:13,096 --> 00:56:15,766
You know, I think I have just the thing.

614
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:19,561
It's called memory cloth.
Notice anything?

615
00:56:22,898 --> 00:56:24,775
Regularly flexible...

616
00:56:25,192 --> 00:56:27,319
...but put a current through it...

617
00:56:28,779 --> 00:56:32,449
- ...molecules realign, it becomes rigid.
- What kind of shapes can you make?

618
00:56:32,616 --> 00:56:35,786
Can be tailored to fit any structure
based on a rigid skeleton.

619
00:56:35,953 --> 00:56:37,120
Too expensive for the Army?

620
00:56:37,329 --> 00:56:42,084
I don't think they tried to market it
to the billionaire, BASE-jumping crowd.

621
00:56:42,251 --> 00:56:44,044
- Look, Mr. Fox.
- Yes, sir?

622
00:56:44,711 --> 00:56:46,088
If you're uncomfortable...

623
00:56:46,255 --> 00:56:49,466
Mr. Wayne, if you don't want to tell me
exactly what you're doing...

624
00:56:49,633 --> 00:56:51,593
...when I'm asked, I don't have to lie.

625
00:56:53,303 --> 00:56:55,931
But don't think of me as an idiot.

626
00:56:57,432 --> 00:56:59,393
Fair enough.

627
00:57:01,311 --> 00:57:03,146
What's that?

628
00:57:05,232 --> 00:57:07,150
The Tumbler?

629
00:57:07,651 --> 00:57:09,611
Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that.

630
00:57:15,617 --> 00:57:17,494
She was built as a bridging vehicle.

631
00:57:19,496 --> 00:57:23,959
During combat, two of these
would jump over a river, towing cables.

632
00:57:26,503 --> 00:57:30,132
Over here on the throttle,
flip that open and throttle up.

633
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:32,884
This will boost you into a rampless jump...
Not now!

634
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:37,848
Not... Not now, sir.

635
00:57:40,684 --> 00:57:42,519
<i>Afterburner disengaged.</i>

636
00:57:42,936 --> 00:57:45,981
We never could get
the damn bridge to work...

637
00:57:46,148 --> 00:57:47,858
...but this baby works just fine.

638
00:57:57,409 --> 00:57:58,660
So, what do you think?

639
00:57:59,911 --> 00:58:01,913
Does it come in black?

640
00:58:02,539 --> 00:58:04,916
I need you at the docks Thursday.

641
00:58:05,167 --> 00:58:07,044
- Problems?
- I don't want any trouble...

642
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:09,338
- ...with the last shipment.
- Sure.

643
00:58:10,922 --> 00:58:14,551
Word on the street is you got a beef
with somebody in the DA's office.

644
00:58:14,718 --> 00:58:17,179
- Is that right?
- And that there's a fat prize...

645
00:58:17,346 --> 00:58:20,057
...waiting for anybody willing
to do anything about it.

646
00:58:20,223 --> 00:58:22,184
So, what's your point, Mr. Flass?

647
00:58:22,643 --> 00:58:23,894
Have you seen the girl?

648
00:58:24,394 --> 00:58:27,064
<i>It's a cute little assistant DA.</i>

649
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:30,901
<i>Don't you think that's a little too much
heat to bring down, maybe?</i>

650
00:58:31,068 --> 00:58:34,404
- Even for this town.
- Never underestimate Gotham City.

651
00:58:34,571 --> 00:58:37,407
People get mugged coming home
from work every day of the week.

652
00:58:37,574 --> 00:58:40,202
Sometimes...
Sometimes things just go bad.

653
00:58:44,081 --> 00:58:45,874
It's a problem with the graphite, sir.

654
00:58:46,083 --> 00:58:48,752
The next 10,000
will be up to specifications.

655
00:58:48,919 --> 00:58:51,505
- At least they gave us a discount.
- Quite.

656
00:58:51,672 --> 00:58:57,260
In the meantime, sir, may I suggest
you try to avoid landing on your head?

657
00:59:34,297 --> 00:59:36,299
Why bats, Master Wayne?

658
00:59:36,591 --> 00:59:37,801
Bats frighten me.

659
00:59:39,136 --> 00:59:41,430
It's time my enemies shared my dread.

660
01:00:08,123 --> 01:00:10,041
What is this?

661
01:00:13,837 --> 01:00:15,172
Continue.

662
01:00:20,677 --> 01:00:22,345
Looks fine out there.

663
01:00:22,763 --> 01:00:24,681
The bears go straight to the dealers.

664
01:00:24,848 --> 01:00:27,517
Yeah, and the rabbits go
to the man in the Narrows.

665
01:00:27,684 --> 01:00:30,687
- What's the difference?
- Ignorance is bliss, my friend.

666
01:00:30,854 --> 01:00:34,024
Don't burden yourself
with the secrets of scary people.

667
01:00:49,873 --> 01:00:52,876
Hey. Steiss.

668
01:01:14,189 --> 01:01:15,649
Stems'?

669
01:01:27,577 --> 01:01:29,204
What?

670
01:01:29,913 --> 01:01:31,414
What the...?

671
01:01:40,423 --> 01:01:42,259
I better check it.

672
01:01:54,771 --> 01:01:56,773
There's a problem out here.
You better bail.

673
01:02:26,136 --> 01:02:27,470
Where are you?!

674
01:02:27,637 --> 01:02:28,638
Here.

675
01:02:49,993 --> 01:02:53,330
Take a ride. Oh, shit.

676
01:03:11,514 --> 01:03:13,266
What the hell are you?

677
01:03:16,686 --> 01:03:17,854
I'm Batman.

678
01:03:26,196 --> 01:03:28,156
Nice coat.

679
01:03:29,866 --> 01:03:31,368
Thanks.

680
01:04:12,409 --> 01:04:13,702
Hold it.

681
01:04:15,829 --> 01:04:18,289
That's right, you better run.

682
01:04:27,257 --> 01:04:29,092
Falcone sent them to kill you.

683
01:04:30,218 --> 01:04:32,804
- Why?
- You rattled his cage.

684
01:04:36,599 --> 01:04:38,101
- What's this?
- Leverage.

685
01:04:38,309 --> 01:04:39,936
- For what?
- To get things moving.

686
01:04:40,228 --> 01:04:42,230
Who are you?

687
01:04:42,605 --> 01:04:43,857
Someone like you.

688
01:04:44,024 --> 01:04:46,067
Someone who'll rattle the cages.

689
01:04:51,114 --> 01:04:54,617
Ma'am? Everything okay?

690
01:04:58,955 --> 01:05:01,458
- Falcone's men?
- Does it matter?

691
01:05:01,624 --> 01:05:03,918
We'll never tie him to it anyway.

692
01:05:04,127 --> 01:05:06,254
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

693
01:05:19,309 --> 01:05:21,144
What the hell is that?

694
01:05:30,737 --> 01:05:31,988
Cut him down.

695
01:05:54,594 --> 01:05:55,845
Unacceptable.

696
01:05:56,012 --> 01:05:58,848
Now, I don't care if it's rival gangs,
Guardian Angels...

697
01:05:59,015 --> 01:06:00,975
...or the goddamn Salvation Army...

698
01:06:01,184 --> 01:06:03,520
...get them off the street
and off the front page.

699
01:06:03,686 --> 01:06:06,314
They say it was just one guy.
Or a creature.

700
01:06:06,481 --> 01:06:09,192
It was some asshole in a costume.

701
01:06:09,692 --> 01:06:11,361
- Yeah?
- This guy did deliver us...

702
01:06:11,528 --> 01:06:14,322
...one of the city's biggest crime lords.

703
01:06:14,489 --> 01:06:17,992
No one takes the law
into their own hands in my city.

704
01:06:18,159 --> 01:06:19,369
Understand?

705
01:06:19,536 --> 01:06:22,372
- No way to bury it now.
- There's still Judge Faden.

706
01:06:22,539 --> 01:06:25,500
- I've got Faden covered.
- What about this bat they babble about?

707
01:06:25,667 --> 01:06:28,670
Even if these guys will swear
to being thrashed by a giant bat...

708
01:06:28,837 --> 01:06:31,005
...we've got Falcone at the scene.

709
01:06:31,172 --> 01:06:34,384
Drugs, prints, cargo manifests.
This bat character gave us everything.

710
01:06:34,801 --> 01:06:36,344
Okay. Let's do it.

711
01:06:39,722 --> 01:06:41,891
- Bats are nocturnal.
- Bats may be.

712
01:06:42,058 --> 01:06:45,478
But even for billionaire playboys,
3:00 is pushing it.

713
01:06:46,521 --> 01:06:49,399
The price for leading a double life,
I fear.

714
01:06:50,733 --> 01:06:53,153
Your theatrics made an impression.

715
01:06:54,529 --> 01:06:57,574
Theatricality and deception...

716
01:06:57,740 --> 01:07:00,910
...are powerful weapons, Alfred.
This is a good start.

717
01:07:01,077 --> 01:07:03,913
If those are to be the first
of many injuries to come...

718
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:06,916
...it would be wise
to find a suitable excuse.

719
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:08,585
Polo, for instance.

720
01:07:08,751 --> 01:07:10,420
I'm not learning polo, Alfred.

721
01:07:10,670 --> 01:07:14,340
Strange injuries,
a nonexistent social life.

722
01:07:14,507 --> 01:07:15,925
These things beg the question...

723
01:07:16,092 --> 01:07:20,388
...as to what exactly does Bruce Wayne
do with his time and his money.

724
01:07:20,555 --> 01:07:22,098
What does someone like me do?

725
01:07:23,099 --> 01:07:27,270
Drive sports cars, date movie stars.

726
01:07:27,979 --> 01:07:29,564
Buy things that are not for sale.

727
01:07:29,731 --> 01:07:33,276
Who knows, Master Wayne,
you start pretending to have fun...

728
01:07:33,902 --> 01:07:35,904
...you might even have a little
by accident.

729
01:07:38,615 --> 01:07:40,074
Sir.

730
01:07:40,241 --> 01:07:42,577
- We have a situation.
- All right.

731
01:07:42,952 --> 01:07:46,789
The Coast Guard picked up
one of our cargo ships last night...

732
01:07:47,290 --> 01:07:52,128
...heavily damaged, all crew missing,
probably dead.

733
01:07:54,130 --> 01:07:56,549
<i>The ship was carrying
a prototype weapon.</i>

734
01:07:56,758 --> 01:07:58,551
<i>It's a microwave emitter.</i>

735
01:07:58,718 --> 01:08:01,638
It's designed for desert warfare, but it...

736
01:08:03,306 --> 01:08:04,933
It looks like somebody...

737
01:08:09,312 --> 01:08:10,813
...turned it on.

738
01:08:14,984 --> 01:08:19,447
It uses focused microwaves to
vaporize the enemy's water supply.

739
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:30,333
<i>The damage to the ship
was catastrophic.</i>

740
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:33,503
The weapon itself is...

741
01:08:34,796 --> 01:08:36,297
Missing?

742
01:08:37,131 --> 01:08:38,341
Yeah.

743
01:08:39,676 --> 01:08:41,636
Mr. Wayne.

744
01:08:45,348 --> 01:08:46,808
Nice car.

745
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:48,351
You should see my other one.

746
01:08:58,152 --> 01:09:00,321
He's done something
the police never have.

747
01:09:00,488 --> 01:09:02,782
You can't take the law
into your own hands.

748
01:09:02,949 --> 01:09:05,535
Well, at least he's getting
something done.

749
01:09:05,702 --> 01:09:08,037
- Bruce, help me out here.
- Huh?

750
01:09:08,204 --> 01:09:12,542
Well, a guy who dresses up
like a bat clearly has issues.

751
01:09:13,584 --> 01:09:15,795
But he's put Falcone behind bars.

752
01:09:15,962 --> 01:09:18,339
Now the cops want him.
What does that tell you?

753
01:09:18,506 --> 01:09:19,716
They're jealous.

754
01:09:19,882 --> 01:09:22,552
Sir, the pool is for decoration...

755
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:26,097
...and your friends
do not have swimwear.

756
01:09:27,890 --> 01:09:29,892
Well, they're European.

757
01:09:31,728 --> 01:09:34,105
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

758
01:09:35,023 --> 01:09:38,484
- It is not a question of money.
- Well, you see...

759
01:09:39,068 --> 01:09:40,862
...I'm buying this hotel...

760
01:09:42,655 --> 01:09:47,076
...and setting some new rules
about the pool area.

761
01:09:48,244 --> 01:09:50,580
I think the Batman deserves a medal.

762
01:09:50,747 --> 01:09:52,915
And a straitjacket to pin it on.

763
01:09:59,422 --> 01:10:01,007
Thank you.

764
01:10:02,759 --> 01:10:04,093
Bruce?

765
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:09,432
Rachel?

766
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,059
I'd heard you were back.

767
01:10:13,102 --> 01:10:14,604
What are you doing?

768
01:10:15,355 --> 01:10:19,776
Just swimming here.
Wow, it is good to see you.

769
01:10:19,942 --> 01:10:21,444
You were gone a long time.

770
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:24,947
- I know. How are things?
- The same.

771
01:10:26,908 --> 01:10:28,576
Job's getting worse.

772
01:10:28,743 --> 01:10:31,454
Can't change the world on your own.

773
01:10:31,621 --> 01:10:33,706
What choice do I have...

774
01:10:34,374 --> 01:10:36,125
...when you're too busy swimming?

775
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:39,462
Rachel, all of...

776
01:10:39,796 --> 01:10:41,464
All this...

777
01:10:42,882 --> 01:10:46,928
It's... It's not me. It's...

778
01:10:47,303 --> 01:10:49,972
Inside, I am...

779
01:10:51,182 --> 01:10:53,142
I am more.

780
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:55,311
Come on, Bruce. Come on.

781
01:10:55,478 --> 01:10:59,315
Bruce, we have
some more hotels for you to buy.

782
01:11:00,316 --> 01:11:01,818
Bruce...

783
01:11:02,985 --> 01:11:06,489
...deep down you may still be
that same great kid you used to be.

784
01:11:08,908 --> 01:11:11,494
But it's not who you are underneath...

785
01:11:11,953 --> 01:11:13,704
...it's what you do that defines you.

786
01:11:26,259 --> 01:11:27,844
Dr. Crane, thanks for coming.

787
01:11:28,010 --> 01:11:30,847
Not at all. He cut his wrists?

788
01:11:31,013 --> 01:11:34,684
Probably looking for the insanity plea.
But if anything should happen...

789
01:11:34,851 --> 01:11:37,854
Of course, better safe than sorry.

790
01:11:41,274 --> 01:11:44,861
Yeah, Dr. Crane, I can't take it anymore.
It's all too much.

791
01:11:45,027 --> 01:11:47,488
The walls are closing in.
Blah, blah, blah.

792
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:50,533
A couple of days of this food,
it'll be true.

793
01:11:51,534 --> 01:11:53,202
- What do you want?
- I wanna know...

794
01:11:53,369 --> 01:11:55,872
...how you're gonna convince me
to keep my mouth shut.

795
01:11:56,038 --> 01:11:58,207
About what?
You don't know anything.

796
01:11:58,374 --> 01:12:02,545
I know you don't want the cops to take
a closer look at the drugs they seized.

797
01:12:02,712 --> 01:12:06,883
And I know about your experiments
with the inmates of your nut house.

798
01:12:07,049 --> 01:12:10,720
See, I don't go into business with a guy
without finding out his dirty secrets.

799
01:12:11,304 --> 01:12:14,223
And those goons you used.

800
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:16,225
I own the muscle in this town.

801
01:12:16,392 --> 01:12:19,770
Now, I've been bringing
your stuff in for months...

802
01:12:20,313 --> 01:12:24,525
...so whatever he's planning,
it's big, and I want in.

803
01:12:25,818 --> 01:12:28,905
Well, I already know what he'll say.

804
01:12:29,363 --> 01:12:30,740
That we should kill you.

805
01:12:32,575 --> 01:12:35,912
Even he can't get me in here.
Not in my town.

806
01:12:41,876 --> 01:12:43,419
Would you like to see my mask?

807
01:12:44,921 --> 01:12:46,422
I use it in my experiments.

808
01:12:48,925 --> 01:12:53,387
Now, I'm probably not very frightening
to a guy like you.

809
01:12:53,763 --> 01:12:56,599
But these crazies, they can't stand it.

810
01:12:57,391 --> 01:12:59,435
So when did the nut
take over the nut house?

811
01:13:01,562 --> 01:13:03,523
They scream and they cry...

812
01:13:04,106 --> 01:13:05,733
...much as you're doing now.

813
01:13:08,069 --> 01:13:11,280
Well, he's not faking. Not that one.

814
01:13:11,447 --> 01:13:13,950
I'll talk to the judge
and see if I can get him moved...

815
01:13:14,116 --> 01:13:17,578
...to the secure wing at Arkham.
I can't treat him here.

816
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,102
Storm's coming.

817
01:13:45,648 --> 01:13:48,651
The scum is getting jumpy
because you stood up to Falcone.

818
01:13:48,859 --> 01:13:52,405
It's a start. Your partner
was at the docks with Falcone.

819
01:13:52,572 --> 01:13:55,283
Well, he moonlights
as a low-level enforcer.

820
01:13:55,658 --> 01:13:59,453
They were splitting the shipment in two.
Only half went to the dealers.

821
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:01,497
Why? What about the other half?

822
01:14:01,998 --> 01:14:04,417
- Flass knows.
- He won't talk.

823
01:14:05,001 --> 01:14:06,627
He'll talk to me.

824
01:14:06,794 --> 01:14:09,839
Commissioner Loeb set up
a massive task force to catch you.

825
01:14:10,298 --> 01:14:12,842
- He thinks you're dangerous.
- What do you think?

826
01:14:14,594 --> 01:14:17,013
I think you're trying to help.

827
01:14:22,018 --> 01:14:24,353
But I've been wrong before.

828
01:14:30,151 --> 01:14:31,861
Come on, I ain't got all night.

829
01:14:35,197 --> 01:14:37,033
Flass, I have kids to feed.

830
01:14:37,491 --> 01:14:39,660
What, they don't like falafel?

831
01:14:55,051 --> 01:14:56,719
Where were the other drugs going?

832
01:14:58,054 --> 01:15:00,222
I never knew. I don't know.

833
01:15:00,389 --> 01:15:02,558
- I swear to God.
- Swear to me!

834
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:11,233
I don't... I don't know.
I never knew. Never.

835
01:15:11,525 --> 01:15:14,945
They went to some guy for a couple days
before they went to the dealers.

836
01:15:15,154 --> 01:15:16,447
Why?

837
01:15:17,073 --> 01:15:20,701
There was something...
Something else in the drugs...

838
01:15:20,868 --> 01:15:22,411
- ...something hidden.
- What?

839
01:15:22,578 --> 01:15:25,915
I never went to the drop-off point.
It was in the Narrows.

840
01:15:26,082 --> 01:15:29,418
- Cops only go there in force.
- Do I look like a cop?

841
01:15:29,585 --> 01:15:31,379
No...!

842
01:15:44,975 --> 01:15:47,019
This is the one I'm talking about.

843
01:15:47,269 --> 01:15:49,605
- What's your problem with it?
- It shouldn't exist.

844
01:15:49,772 --> 01:15:53,609
This ship left Singapore with
246 containers, but arrived with 247.

845
01:15:53,776 --> 01:15:56,299
I'm guessing there's something
I'm not supposed to find in there.

846
01:15:56,399 --> 01:15:59,740
Listen, counselor, we don't wanna
know what's in Mr. Falcone's crate.

847
01:15:59,907 --> 01:16:03,244
Things are working a little
differently now. Open it up.

848
01:16:12,503 --> 01:16:13,796
What the hell is this?

849
01:16:56,672 --> 01:16:59,842
It's you, isn't it?
Everybody's been talking about you.

850
01:17:00,426 --> 01:17:02,178
Get in here!

851
01:17:02,803 --> 01:17:04,930
The other kids won't believe me.

852
01:17:28,037 --> 01:17:30,164
Get rid of all traces.

853
01:17:30,456 --> 01:17:33,375
- Better torch the whole place.
- All right.

854
01:18:09,411 --> 01:18:11,205
Having trouble?

855
01:18:11,914 --> 01:18:14,250
Take a seat. Have a drink.

856
01:18:14,917 --> 01:18:18,212
You look like a man
who takes himself too seriously.

857
01:18:21,924 --> 01:18:24,927
Do you want my opinion?
You need to lighten up.

858
01:19:16,896 --> 01:19:20,608
Alfred, help me.

859
01:19:30,492 --> 01:19:33,829
Blood. Take. Take poison. Blood poison.

860
01:19:33,996 --> 01:19:36,999
Poisonous. Poisonous.

861
01:19:41,337 --> 01:19:43,005
<i>Bruce...</i>

862
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:45,507
<i>...why do we fall?</i>

863
01:19:57,519 --> 01:20:00,856
- How long was I out?
- Two days.

864
01:20:01,231 --> 01:20:03,108
It's your birthday.

865
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:05,694
Many happy returns.

866
01:20:10,866 --> 01:20:14,703
I've felt these effects before,
but this was so much more potent.

867
01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:19,458
It was some kind of hallucinogen,
weaponized, in aerosol form.

868
01:20:19,625 --> 01:20:22,544
You have been hanging out
in the wrong clubs, Mr. Wayne.

869
01:20:22,753 --> 01:20:25,839
I called Mr. Fox when your condition
worsened after the first day.

870
01:20:26,006 --> 01:20:27,383
I analyzed your blood...

871
01:20:27,549 --> 01:20:31,053
...isolating the receptor compounds
and the protein-based catalyst.

872
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:33,013
Am I meant to understand any of that?

873
01:20:33,389 --> 01:20:36,558
Not at all. I just wanted you to know
how hard it was.

874
01:20:37,142 --> 01:20:40,854
- Bottom line, I synthesized an antidote.
- Could you make more?

875
01:20:41,021 --> 01:20:43,565
You planning on gassing yourself
again, Mr. Wayne?

876
01:20:43,774 --> 01:20:46,986
Well, you know how it is.
You're out at night, looking for kicks...

877
01:20:47,152 --> 01:20:49,905
...someone's passing around
the weaponized hallucinogens...

878
01:20:50,072 --> 01:20:53,534
I'll bring what I have.
The antidote should inoculate you for now.

879
01:20:53,701 --> 01:20:56,078
Alfred, always a pleasure.

880
01:20:56,245 --> 01:20:57,913
Lucius.

881
01:21:02,418 --> 01:21:05,087
- You sure you don't want to come in?
- I have to get back.

882
01:21:05,254 --> 01:21:06,922
- I wanted to leave this.
- Thank you.

883
01:21:07,089 --> 01:21:08,507
Rachel?

884
01:21:09,883 --> 01:21:13,095
Looks like someone's been
burning the candle at both ends.

885
01:21:13,262 --> 01:21:15,931
- Must've been quite an occasion.
- It is my birthday.

886
01:21:16,098 --> 01:21:19,768
I know. I'm sorry I can't come tonight.
I was just dropping off your present.

887
01:21:19,935 --> 01:21:23,355
- You've got better plans?
- My boss has been missing for days...

888
01:21:23,522 --> 01:21:25,858
...which means I should
probably start by looking...

889
01:21:26,025 --> 01:21:27,776
- ...at the bottom of the river.
- Rachel.

890
01:21:29,194 --> 01:21:30,320
Excuse me.

891
01:21:31,864 --> 01:21:33,115
Rachel Dawes.

892
01:21:33,699 --> 01:21:37,286
Who authorized that? Get Crane down
there now. Don't take no for an answer.

893
01:21:37,453 --> 01:21:41,373
Call Dr. Lehmann, tell him we need our
own assessment to the judge by morning.

894
01:21:41,790 --> 01:21:43,625
- What's wrong?
- It's Falcone.

895
01:21:43,792 --> 01:21:46,295
Dr. Crane moved him to Arkham Asylum
on suicide watch.

896
01:21:46,462 --> 01:21:49,465
You're going to Arkham now?
It's in the Narrows, Rachel.

897
01:21:50,716 --> 01:21:52,551
You enjoy your party, Bruce.

898
01:21:52,718 --> 01:21:55,471
- Some of us have work to do.
- You be careful.

899
01:21:57,222 --> 01:21:58,807
Happy birthday.

900
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:20,329
But, Master Wayne,
the guests will be arriving.

901
01:22:20,496 --> 01:22:22,122
Keep them happy until I arrive.

902
01:22:22,289 --> 01:22:24,500
Tell them that joke you know.

903
01:23:03,330 --> 01:23:05,040
Having fun?

904
01:23:07,167 --> 01:23:10,712
Bill? Now, what's a big shot like you
doing in a place like this?

905
01:23:10,921 --> 01:23:12,214
I need some information.

906
01:23:12,381 --> 01:23:17,177
The Wayne Enterprise 47-B, 1-ME.

907
01:23:18,470 --> 01:23:19,972
1-ME.

908
01:23:20,139 --> 01:23:23,892
It's a microwave emitter. It was designed
to vaporize an enemy's water supply.

909
01:23:24,059 --> 01:23:28,230
Rumor was they tested dispersing
water-based chemicals into the air...

910
01:23:28,438 --> 01:23:30,399
...but isn't that illegal?

911
01:23:32,067 --> 01:23:36,363
I want all the information
on the development of this project...

912
01:23:36,530 --> 01:23:40,534
...all data, files, backup disks,
on my desk right away.

913
01:23:40,909 --> 01:23:42,578
Did you lose one?

914
01:23:43,579 --> 01:23:47,249
I'm merging your department
with Archives.

915
01:23:48,458 --> 01:23:49,751
And I am firing you.

916
01:23:51,879 --> 01:23:53,881
Didn't you get the memo?

917
01:24:01,096 --> 01:24:02,764
Scarecrow.

918
01:24:06,059 --> 01:24:07,936
Scarecrow.

919
01:24:11,273 --> 01:24:12,608
Scarecrow.

920
01:24:15,611 --> 01:24:17,779
Miss Dawes, this is most irregular.

921
01:24:17,988 --> 01:24:20,908
I have nothing to add
to the report I filed with the judge.

922
01:24:21,074 --> 01:24:23,285
- I have questions about your report.
- Such as?

923
01:24:23,493 --> 01:24:27,789
Isn't it convenient for a 52-year-old man
who has no history of mental illness...

924
01:24:27,956 --> 01:24:31,585
...to have a psychotic breakdown
just when he's about to be indicted?

925
01:24:31,752 --> 01:24:36,006
As you can see for yourself, there is
nothing convenient about his symptoms.

926
01:24:40,636 --> 01:24:42,054
- Scarecrow.
- What's "scarecrow"?

927
01:24:42,512 --> 01:24:46,141
Patients suffering delusional episodes
often focus their paranoia...

928
01:24:46,308 --> 01:24:48,435
...on an external tormentor...

929
01:24:48,602 --> 01:24:51,813
...usually one conforming
to Jungian archetypes.

930
01:24:52,022 --> 01:24:54,441
In this case, a scarecrow.

931
01:24:55,901 --> 01:24:59,988
- He's drugged?
- Psychopharmacology is my primary field.

932
01:25:00,155 --> 01:25:02,115
<i>I'm a strong advocate.</i>

933
01:25:02,491 --> 01:25:04,660
<i>Outside, he was a giant.</i>

934
01:25:04,826 --> 01:25:07,329
In here, only the mind
can grant you power.

935
01:25:07,496 --> 01:25:09,248
You enjoy the reversal.

936
01:25:09,414 --> 01:25:12,417
I respect the mind's power
over the body.

937
01:25:12,584 --> 01:25:14,127
It's why I do what I do.

938
01:25:14,294 --> 01:25:19,174
I do what I do to keep thugs like Falcone
behind bars, not in therapy.

939
01:25:19,341 --> 01:25:22,678
I want my own psychiatric consultant
to have full access to Falcone...

940
01:25:22,844 --> 01:25:26,181
...including blood work.
Find out what exactly you put him on.

941
01:25:26,348 --> 01:25:28,850
- First thing tomorrow, then.
- Tonight.

942
01:25:29,017 --> 01:25:32,479
I've already paged Dr. Lehmann
at County General.

943
01:25:33,855 --> 01:25:35,691
As you wish.

944
01:25:41,196 --> 01:25:43,156
This way, please.

945
01:25:43,323 --> 01:25:45,951
There's something
I think you should see.

946
01:25:56,837 --> 01:25:59,464
This is where we make the medicine.

947
01:26:06,221 --> 01:26:10,183
Perhaps you should have some,
clear your head.

948
01:26:35,417 --> 01:26:37,044
Who knows you're here?

949
01:26:38,086 --> 01:26:39,713
Who knows?

950
01:26:46,928 --> 01:26:48,180
He's here.

951
01:26:48,347 --> 01:26:49,598
Who?

952
01:26:49,765 --> 01:26:51,725
The Batman.

953
01:26:53,518 --> 01:26:55,437
- What do we do?
- What anyone does...

954
01:26:55,604 --> 01:26:58,398
...when a prowler comes around.

955
01:26:59,274 --> 01:27:01,902
- Call the police.
- You want the cops here?

956
01:27:02,444 --> 01:27:05,238
At this point, they can't stop us.

957
01:27:05,405 --> 01:27:08,950
But the Batman
has a talent for disruption.

958
01:27:09,117 --> 01:27:12,204
Force him outside,
the police will take him down. Go.

959
01:27:12,371 --> 01:27:14,623
- What about her?
- She hasn't got long.

960
01:27:14,790 --> 01:27:16,750
I gave her a concentrated dose.

961
01:27:16,917 --> 01:27:19,461
The mind can only take so much.
Now go.

962
01:27:21,963 --> 01:27:24,299
The things they say about him.

963
01:27:24,466 --> 01:27:25,967
Can he really fly?

964
01:27:26,176 --> 01:27:28,261
I heard he can disappear.

965
01:27:28,428 --> 01:27:31,473
Well, we'll find out.

966
01:27:31,723 --> 01:27:33,392
Won't we?

967
01:28:20,689 --> 01:28:22,858
Taste of your own medicine, doctor?

968
01:28:29,489 --> 01:28:31,366
What have you been doing here?

969
01:28:34,453 --> 01:28:36,872
Who are you working for?

970
01:28:41,293 --> 01:28:43,670
Ra's... Ra's al Ghul.

971
01:28:43,837 --> 01:28:48,717
Ra's al Ghul is dead.
Who are you working for?

972
01:28:48,884 --> 01:28:49,885
Crane.

973
01:28:52,387 --> 01:28:55,348
Dr. Crane isn't here right now.

974
01:28:55,891 --> 01:28:57,809
But if you'd like to make
an appointment...

975
01:29:10,822 --> 01:29:13,742
Batman, put down your
weapons and surrender.

976
01:29:14,409 --> 01:29:15,869
You're surrounded.

977
01:29:21,416 --> 01:29:24,211
- What are you waiting for?
- Backup.

978
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:27,339
- Backup?
- The Batman's in there.

979
01:29:27,506 --> 01:29:29,674
SWAT's on the way.
But if you wanna go in now...

980
01:29:29,841 --> 01:29:31,384
...I'll be right behind you, sir.

981
01:29:32,886 --> 01:29:34,429
SWAT's on the way.

982
01:29:35,514 --> 01:29:36,806
- Hey.
- Hey.

983
01:30:19,307 --> 01:30:20,976
What's happened to her?

984
01:30:23,645 --> 01:30:27,482
Crane poisoned her with a psychotropic
hallucinogen, a panic-inducing toxin.

985
01:30:29,484 --> 01:30:33,238
- Let me get her down to the medics.
- They can't help her, but I can.

986
01:30:37,158 --> 01:30:39,327
Get her downstairs.
Meet me in the alley.

987
01:30:47,294 --> 01:30:50,171
Crane's been smuggling his toxin
hidden in Falcone's drugs...

988
01:30:50,338 --> 01:30:52,507
...and they're dumping it
into the water supply.

989
01:30:53,008 --> 01:30:54,676
- What was he planning?
- I don't know.

990
01:30:54,884 --> 01:30:56,177
Was he working for Falcone?

991
01:30:56,678 --> 01:30:59,180
He mentioned someone else,
someone worse.

992
01:30:59,389 --> 01:31:01,975
She needs the antidote
before the damage is permanent.

993
01:31:02,142 --> 01:31:04,352
- How long does she have?
- Not long.

994
01:31:08,189 --> 01:31:10,025
What is that?

995
01:31:11,401 --> 01:31:13,695
- Backup.
- What the...?

996
01:32:31,898 --> 01:32:33,441
Excuse me.

997
01:32:38,196 --> 01:32:41,449
- How is she?
- She's fading. We gotta go.

998
01:32:43,284 --> 01:32:44,744
I'll get my car.

999
01:32:44,911 --> 01:32:46,746
I brought mine.

1000
01:32:47,122 --> 01:32:48,790
Yours?

1001
01:32:58,091 --> 01:32:59,926
I've gotta get me one of those.

1002
01:33:00,427 --> 01:33:01,761
He is in a vehicle.

1003
01:33:01,928 --> 01:33:03,430
<i>Make and color?</i>

1004
01:33:03,596 --> 01:33:05,807
It's a black...

1005
01:33:07,142 --> 01:33:08,476
...tank.

1006
01:33:11,104 --> 01:33:12,480
Stay calm.

1007
01:33:13,148 --> 01:33:14,941
You've been poisoned.

1008
01:33:17,652 --> 01:33:18,987
I'm on him.

1009
01:33:27,328 --> 01:33:28,455
Breathe slowly.

1010
01:33:38,548 --> 01:33:39,674
Hold on.

1011
01:33:54,147 --> 01:33:55,523
- What are you doing?
- Shortcut.

1012
01:34:03,615 --> 01:34:06,326
<i>Air One to ground, block that ramp.</i>

1013
01:34:10,371 --> 01:34:11,998
<i>He's got no way off that roof.</i>

1014
01:34:13,374 --> 01:34:16,503
Turn off your engine.
Step away from the car.

1015
01:34:18,438 --> 01:34:19,499
Trust me.

1016
01:34:19,599 --> 01:34:21,657
<i>Weapons system activated.</i>

1017
01:34:39,526 --> 01:34:40,568
Who is this guy?

1018
01:34:40,735 --> 01:34:42,237
<i>Where's he going?</i>

1019
01:34:42,403 --> 01:34:43,613
He's on the roof.

1020
01:34:57,252 --> 01:34:59,921
<i>- What street is he taking?</i>
- He's not on a street.

1021
01:35:00,088 --> 01:35:01,381
He's flying on rooftops.

1022
01:35:40,587 --> 01:35:42,797
At least tell me what it looks like.

1023
01:35:45,800 --> 01:35:47,302
Never mind.

1024
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:52,557
Got him.

1025
01:36:03,443 --> 01:36:04,986
Coming right up on his butt.

1026
01:36:29,719 --> 01:36:32,931
<i>We're tracking suspect
vehicle heading Weston I-17.</i>

1027
01:36:37,435 --> 01:36:39,145
<i>- Air One to ground.</i>
- I lost him.

1028
01:36:39,312 --> 01:36:41,356
<i>We've lost visual. Exit 9 is blocked.</i>

1029
01:36:41,522 --> 01:36:43,483
<i>We'll loop back to check
the frontage road.</i>

1030
01:36:43,650 --> 01:36:45,652
<i>Stealth mode activated.</i>

1031
01:36:46,277 --> 01:36:47,528
Stay with me.

1032
01:36:53,701 --> 01:36:55,203
What...? There he is.

1033
01:37:14,889 --> 01:37:16,349
Just hold on.

1034
01:37:20,311 --> 01:37:21,521
Rachel!

1035
01:37:53,594 --> 01:37:55,763
They get any of this into the mains?

1036
01:37:55,930 --> 01:37:56,931
Yeah.

1037
01:37:57,098 --> 01:37:59,934
Notify the water company.
There's gotta be a way to isolate it.

1038
01:38:00,101 --> 01:38:02,770
No. They put it all in.
They must've been at this for weeks.

1039
01:38:02,937 --> 01:38:06,441
- Gotham's entire water supply is laced.
- Why haven't we felt the effects?

1040
01:38:06,607 --> 01:38:09,007
Must be a compound that
has to be absorbed through the lungs.

1041
01:38:19,120 --> 01:38:20,872
How do you feel?

1042
01:38:23,624 --> 01:38:25,126
Where are we?

1043
01:38:25,626 --> 01:38:29,422
- Why did you bring me here?
- If I hadn't, your mind would be lost.

1044
01:38:29,589 --> 01:38:31,632
- You were poisoned.
- It was...

1045
01:38:31,799 --> 01:38:35,428
- It was Dr. Crane.
- Rest. Gordon has Crane.

1046
01:38:35,595 --> 01:38:37,722
Is Sergeant Gordon your friend?

1047
01:38:38,556 --> 01:38:40,224
I don't have the luxury of friends.

1048
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:44,437
I'm gonna give you a sedative.
You'll wake up back at home.

1049
01:38:44,604 --> 01:38:48,566
When you do, get these to Gordon,
and Gordon alone. Trust no one.

1050
01:38:48,733 --> 01:38:50,485
- What are they?
- The antidote.

1051
01:38:50,651 --> 01:38:53,988
One for Gordon to inoculate himself,
the other for mass production.

1052
01:38:54,363 --> 01:38:55,656
Mass production?

1053
01:38:55,823 --> 01:38:58,993
Crane was just a pawn.
We need to be ready.

1054
01:39:24,936 --> 01:39:28,356
When you told me your grand plan
for saving Gotham...

1055
01:39:28,523 --> 01:39:31,442
...all that stopped me
from calling the men in white coats...

1056
01:39:31,609 --> 01:39:34,112
...was when you said
it wasn't about thrill-seeking.

1057
01:39:34,278 --> 01:39:37,323
- It's not.
- What would you call that?

1058
01:39:39,158 --> 01:39:41,869
- Damn good television.
- It's a miracle no one was killed.

1059
01:39:42,036 --> 01:39:45,706
I didn't have time to observe
the rules of the road, Alfred.

1060
01:39:45,873 --> 01:39:49,001
You're getting lost inside
this monster of yours.

1061
01:39:49,168 --> 01:39:53,548
I'm using this monster to help
other people, just like my father did.

1062
01:39:53,714 --> 01:39:55,341
For Thomas Wayne, helping others...

1063
01:39:55,508 --> 01:39:58,427
...wasn't about proving anything
to anyone, including himself.

1064
01:39:58,886 --> 01:40:02,223
It's Rachel, Alfred. She was dying.

1065
01:40:02,682 --> 01:40:05,309
She's downstairs, sedated.
I need you to take her home.

1066
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:09,230
Well, we both care for Rachel, but what
you're doing has to be beyond that.

1067
01:40:09,522 --> 01:40:12,400
It can't be personal,
or you're just a vigilante.

1068
01:40:12,567 --> 01:40:14,485
- Is Fox still here?
- Yes, sir.

1069
01:40:14,652 --> 01:40:16,279
We need to send these people away.

1070
01:40:16,487 --> 01:40:19,407
Those are Bruce Wayne's guests.
You have a name to maintain.

1071
01:40:19,574 --> 01:40:21,409
I don't care about my name.

1072
01:40:21,576 --> 01:40:24,745
It's not just your name, sir.
It's your father's name.

1073
01:40:26,539 --> 01:40:28,916
And it's all that's left of him.

1074
01:40:30,835 --> 01:40:32,420
Don't destroy it.

1075
01:40:47,727 --> 01:40:49,896
- Mr. Earle.
- Happy birthday, Bruce.

1076
01:40:50,062 --> 01:40:51,480
Thank you.

1077
01:40:51,772 --> 01:40:53,774
How did the stock offering go?

1078
01:40:54,066 --> 01:40:55,276
Prices soared.

1079
01:40:55,443 --> 01:40:56,694
Who was buying?

1080
01:40:56,861 --> 01:40:58,779
All kinds of funds and brokerages.

1081
01:40:58,946 --> 01:41:00,615
It's a bit technical.

1082
01:41:00,781 --> 01:41:02,533
The key thing is...

1083
01:41:02,700 --> 01:41:04,702
...our company's future is secure.

1084
01:41:06,537 --> 01:41:07,580
Great.

1085
01:41:21,302 --> 01:41:23,596
A little the worse for wear, I'm afraid.

1086
01:41:29,310 --> 01:41:31,103
What was the plan, Crane?

1087
01:41:31,270 --> 01:41:33,522
How were you gonna get
your toxin into the air?

1088
01:41:33,898 --> 01:41:37,151
Scarecrow. Scarecrow.

1089
01:41:37,318 --> 01:41:39,153
Who were you working for, Crane?

1090
01:41:41,280 --> 01:41:43,491
Oh, it's too late.

1091
01:41:44,075 --> 01:41:46,160
You can't stop it now.

1092
01:41:51,249 --> 01:41:52,792
Here.

1093
01:41:52,959 --> 01:41:55,002
- Happy birthday, Bruce.
- Thank you. Thanks.

1094
01:41:55,169 --> 01:41:58,047
And thank you for that item.

1095
01:41:59,548 --> 01:42:00,800
You're welcome.

1096
01:42:00,967 --> 01:42:03,761
- I know you'll put it to good use.
- I already have.

1097
01:42:04,011 --> 01:42:07,848
How long would it take
to manufacture on a large scale?

1098
01:42:08,349 --> 01:42:09,517
Weeks. Why?

1099
01:42:09,684 --> 01:42:12,853
Somebody's planning to disperse
the toxin using the water supply.

1100
01:42:13,854 --> 01:42:16,941
The water supply won't help you
disperse an inhalant.

1101
01:42:17,858 --> 01:42:19,277
What?

1102
01:42:19,443 --> 01:42:21,988
Unless you have a microwave emitter
powerful enough...

1103
01:42:22,154 --> 01:42:25,032
...to vaporize all the water
in the mains.

1104
01:42:25,449 --> 01:42:28,703
A microwave emitter like the one
Wayne Enterprises just misplaced.

1105
01:42:29,161 --> 01:42:30,371
Misplaced?

1106
01:42:30,538 --> 01:42:34,041
Earle just fired me for asking
too many questions about it.

1107
01:42:36,043 --> 01:42:39,547
Go back to Wayne Enterprises now
and start making more of that antidote.

1108
01:42:39,714 --> 01:42:42,842
The police are gonna need as much
as they can get their hands on.

1109
01:42:43,009 --> 01:42:45,052
My security clearance
has been revoked.

1110
01:42:45,219 --> 01:42:47,221
That wouldn't stop a man like you,
would it?

1111
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:49,390
I suppose not.

1112
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:56,063
- Bruce, there's somebody you must meet.
- Not now, Mrs. Delane.

1113
01:42:56,230 --> 01:42:59,150
Now, am I pronouncing this right...

1114
01:42:59,317 --> 01:43:01,736
...Mr. Ra's al Ghul?

1115
01:43:07,408 --> 01:43:09,201
You're not Ra's al Ghul.

1116
01:43:10,745 --> 01:43:12,038
I watched him die.

1117
01:43:12,204 --> 01:43:15,249
But is Ra's al Ghul immortal?

1118
01:43:18,002 --> 01:43:20,421
Are his methods supernatural?

1119
01:43:25,009 --> 01:43:29,430
Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal
your true identity, Ra's?

1120
01:43:31,265 --> 01:43:35,770
Surely a man who spends his nights
scrambling over the rooftops of Gotham...

1121
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:37,938
...wouldn't begrudge me dual identities.

1122
01:43:38,773 --> 01:43:40,608
I saved your life.

1123
01:43:40,775 --> 01:43:43,277
I warned you about compassion, Bruce.

1124
01:43:46,447 --> 01:43:48,657
Your quarrel is with me.

1125
01:43:49,533 --> 01:43:52,036
You let these people go.

1126
01:43:52,286 --> 01:43:55,581
You are welcome to explain
the situation to them.

1127
01:43:57,792 --> 01:43:59,460
Everyone.

1128
01:44:00,252 --> 01:44:02,129
Everybody?

1129
01:44:04,715 --> 01:44:06,592
I...

1130
01:44:07,051 --> 01:44:11,305
I want to thank you all for coming here
tonight and drinking all of my booze.

1131
01:44:13,391 --> 01:44:15,101
No, really.

1132
01:44:16,143 --> 01:44:18,896
There's a thing about being a Wayne...

1133
01:44:19,063 --> 01:44:22,650
...that you're never short of
a few freeloaders, like yourselves...

1134
01:44:22,817 --> 01:44:26,487
...to fill up your mansion with.
So here's to you people. Thank you.

1135
01:44:26,654 --> 01:44:29,281
- That's enough, Bruce.
- I'm not finished.

1136
01:44:29,615 --> 01:44:31,325
To all of you...

1137
01:44:31,492 --> 01:44:35,830
All of you phonies,
all of you two-faced friends...

1138
01:44:35,996 --> 01:44:41,127
...you sycophantic suck-ups
who smile through your teeth at me...

1139
01:44:41,293 --> 01:44:44,839
...please, leave me in peace.

1140
01:44:45,005 --> 01:44:47,675
Please go.

1141
01:44:48,008 --> 01:44:51,429
Stop smiling, it's not a joke.
Please leave.

1142
01:44:51,595 --> 01:44:53,806
The party's over, get out.

1143
01:44:53,973 --> 01:44:57,226
The apple has fallen very far
from the tree, Mr. Wayne.

1144
01:45:02,022 --> 01:45:04,358
He's turning into a jerk.

1145
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:12,366
Amusing.

1146
01:45:12,700 --> 01:45:16,162
But pointless.
None of these people have long to live.

1147
01:45:16,328 --> 01:45:19,832
Your antics at the asylum
have forced my hand.

1148
01:45:19,999 --> 01:45:22,168
So Crane was working for you.

1149
01:45:22,334 --> 01:45:26,172
His toxin is derived from the organic
compound found in our blue flowers.

1150
01:45:26,505 --> 01:45:28,549
He was able to weaponize it.

1151
01:45:28,716 --> 01:45:30,718
He's not a member of
the League of Shadows?

1152
01:45:30,885 --> 01:45:35,389
Of course not. He thought our plan
was to hold the city to ransom.

1153
01:45:36,140 --> 01:45:40,686
But really, you are gonna release
Crane's poison on the entire city.

1154
01:45:40,853 --> 01:45:44,899
Then watch Gotham tear itself apart
through fear.

1155
01:45:57,536 --> 01:45:59,663
<i>You're gonna destroy millions of lives.</i>

1156
01:45:59,872 --> 01:46:03,334
Only a cynical man would call
what these people have "lives," Wayne.

1157
01:46:03,501 --> 01:46:05,211
Crime. Despair.

1158
01:46:05,377 --> 01:46:07,421
This is not how man
was supposed to live.

1159
01:46:08,088 --> 01:46:11,258
The League of Shadows has been
a check against human corruption...

1160
01:46:11,425 --> 01:46:12,927
...for thousands of years.

1161
01:46:13,093 --> 01:46:16,680
We sacked Rome.
Loaded trade ships with plague rats.

1162
01:46:16,847 --> 01:46:18,265
Burned London to the ground.

1163
01:46:18,432 --> 01:46:21,268
Every time a civilization reaches
the pinnacle of its decadence...

1164
01:46:21,435 --> 01:46:23,395
...we return to restore the balance.

1165
01:46:23,562 --> 01:46:25,105
Gotham isn't beyond saving.

1166
01:46:26,440 --> 01:46:29,109
Give me more time.
There are good people here.

1167
01:46:29,318 --> 01:46:31,111
You're defending a city so corrupt...

1168
01:46:31,320 --> 01:46:34,448
...we have infiltrated
every level of its infrastructure.

1169
01:46:45,584 --> 01:46:46,961
Time to play.

1170
01:46:51,131 --> 01:46:53,801
When I found you in that jail,
you were lost.

1171
01:46:53,968 --> 01:46:56,095
But I believed in you.

1172
01:46:56,262 --> 01:46:59,974
I took away your fear,
and I showed you a path.

1173
01:47:00,266 --> 01:47:02,476
You were my greatest student.

1174
01:47:02,810 --> 01:47:05,980
It should be you standing by my side,
saving the world.

1175
01:47:06,772 --> 01:47:09,400
I'll be standing where I belong.

1176
01:47:09,984 --> 01:47:13,153
Between you
and the people of Gotham.

1177
01:47:14,822 --> 01:47:17,449
No one can save Gotham.

1178
01:47:20,786 --> 01:47:25,457
When a forest grows too wild,
a purging fire is inevitable and natural.

1179
01:47:26,667 --> 01:47:31,338
Tomorrow the world will watch in horror
as its greatest city destroys itself.

1180
01:47:31,880 --> 01:47:35,134
The movement back to harmony
will be unstoppable this time.

1181
01:47:35,426 --> 01:47:37,636
- You attacked Gotham before?
- Of course.

1182
01:47:37,845 --> 01:47:40,514
Over the ages our weapons
have grown more sophisticated.

1183
01:47:40,681 --> 01:47:43,517
With Gotham we tried a new one.
Economics.

1184
01:47:43,976 --> 01:47:48,689
But we underestimated certain
of Gotham's citizens...

1185
01:47:49,106 --> 01:47:51,317
...such as your parents.

1186
01:47:55,362 --> 01:47:58,866
Gunned down by one of the very people
they were trying to help.

1187
01:47:59,116 --> 01:48:01,869
Create enough hunger
and everyone becomes a criminal.

1188
01:48:02,036 --> 01:48:04,538
Their deaths galvanized the city
into saving itself...

1189
01:48:04,705 --> 01:48:07,374
...and Gotham has limped on
ever since.

1190
01:48:07,541 --> 01:48:09,376
We are back to finish the job.

1191
01:48:10,044 --> 01:48:13,339
And this time no misguided idealists
will get in the way.

1192
01:48:13,505 --> 01:48:17,051
Like your father, you lack the courage
to do all that is necessary.

1193
01:48:17,384 --> 01:48:20,220
If someone stands in the way
of true justice...

1194
01:48:20,429 --> 01:48:24,516
...you simply walk up behind them
and stab them in the heart.

1195
01:48:29,521 --> 01:48:31,690
- I am gonna stop you.
- You never did learn...

1196
01:48:31,857 --> 01:48:33,901
...to mind your surroundings.

1197
01:48:36,070 --> 01:48:38,072
Justice is balance.

1198
01:48:38,238 --> 01:48:40,407
You burned my house
and left me for dead.

1199
01:48:43,077 --> 01:48:45,245
Consider us even.

1200
01:49:01,595 --> 01:49:03,389
No one comes out. Make sure.

1201
01:49:13,273 --> 01:49:14,733
They're all gone?

1202
01:49:14,900 --> 01:49:17,611
- How many from maximum security?
- Every one of them.

1203
01:49:17,778 --> 01:49:19,613
Serial killers, rapists.

1204
01:49:19,780 --> 01:49:22,616
Raise the bridges.
We don't want any getting off the island.

1205
01:49:22,783 --> 01:49:24,451
Yeah, I'll raise the bridges...

1206
01:49:24,618 --> 01:49:28,706
...when I get every available unit out here
to catch the homicidal maniacs...

1207
01:49:28,872 --> 01:49:31,750
- ...that are running loose out there.
- Come on!

1208
01:49:54,940 --> 01:49:57,651
I hope you're not a member
of the fire brigade.

1209
01:50:03,657 --> 01:50:05,826
Master Wayne! Master Wayne!

1210
01:50:10,330 --> 01:50:14,668
What is the point of all those pushups
if you can't even lift a bloody log?

1211
01:50:53,165 --> 01:50:55,209
What have I done, Alfred?

1212
01:50:56,210 --> 01:50:58,212
Everything my family...

1213
01:50:58,378 --> 01:51:00,297
...my father, built...

1214
01:51:02,674 --> 01:51:06,553
The Wayne legacy is more
than bricks and mortar, sir.

1215
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:09,014
I wanted to save Gotham.

1216
01:51:09,848 --> 01:51:11,725
I failed.

1217
01:51:12,893 --> 01:51:14,228
Why do we fall, sir?

1218
01:51:17,397 --> 01:51:20,901
So that we can learn
to pick ourselves up.

1219
01:51:23,362 --> 01:51:25,531
You still haven't given up on me?

1220
01:51:27,407 --> 01:51:28,909
Never.

1221
01:51:29,910 --> 01:51:31,245
Down!

1222
01:51:31,411 --> 01:51:34,373
Harassment! I see harassment!

1223
01:51:34,540 --> 01:51:36,583
Maybe you'd like to see
some excessive force?

1224
01:51:36,750 --> 01:51:38,710
Madman with a gun.

1225
01:51:39,753 --> 01:51:41,421
<i>With residents furious...</i>

1226
01:51:41,630 --> 01:51:44,758
<i>...at the unprecedented show of police
strength to round up the inmates...</i>

1227
01:51:44,925 --> 01:51:46,760
We're about to raise these bridges.

1228
01:51:46,927 --> 01:51:50,597
Officer, I am a Gotham City
district attorney. Let me pass.

1229
01:51:57,938 --> 01:52:00,274
- Just shut up!
- Hey, Flass, cool it!

1230
01:52:00,440 --> 01:52:01,942
Hold these people back.

1231
01:52:02,109 --> 01:52:04,903
Hey, Gordon.
Somebody here to see you.

1232
01:52:05,070 --> 01:52:07,447
- What are you doing here?
- Our friend sent me with this.

1233
01:52:07,656 --> 01:52:09,116
It counteracts Crane's toxin.

1234
01:52:09,283 --> 01:52:10,784
Hopefully you won't need it.

1235
01:52:10,951 --> 01:52:14,121
Not unless he's got some way
of getting that crap into the air.

1236
01:52:15,247 --> 01:52:17,708
All right, last one across.

1237
01:52:18,375 --> 01:52:22,296
People, they want this
bridge up in no more than three minutes!

1238
01:52:22,462 --> 01:52:25,883
Better get you off the island before
they raise the bridges. Patrolman!

1239
01:52:26,466 --> 01:52:27,509
Go!

1240
01:52:54,328 --> 01:52:56,163
I can't find my mom.

1241
01:52:56,496 --> 01:52:57,998
Hey!

1242
01:53:06,340 --> 01:53:08,133
What the hell are you doing?

1243
01:53:09,635 --> 01:53:11,219
Gentlemen...

1244
01:53:11,637 --> 01:53:14,181
...time to spread the word.

1245
01:53:15,849 --> 01:53:17,309
And the word is...

1246
01:53:18,518 --> 01:53:20,312
...panic.

1247
01:53:44,294 --> 01:53:45,837
Jesus. The pressure, it's spiking.

1248
01:53:47,214 --> 01:53:48,340
Right there.

1249
01:53:48,632 --> 01:53:50,884
That water main
is right under the Narrows.

1250
01:54:07,818 --> 01:54:09,403
It's okay.

1251
01:54:42,227 --> 01:54:43,770
This is Commissioner Loeb.

1252
01:54:43,937 --> 01:54:45,605
Come on, somebody talk to me.

1253
01:54:45,814 --> 01:54:47,274
Come on!

1254
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:08,962
Loeb, Loeb. This is Gordon.

1255
01:55:09,296 --> 01:55:10,630
What the hell is going on?

1256
01:55:10,797 --> 01:55:14,259
We need reinforcements.
TAC teams, SWAT, riot cops!

1257
01:55:14,426 --> 01:55:18,638
Gordon! All the city's riot police
are on the island with you!

1258
01:55:18,805 --> 01:55:21,475
<i>Well, they're completely incapacitated!</i>

1259
01:55:21,641 --> 01:55:25,145
It's okay, it's okay.
No one's gonna hurt you.

1260
01:55:25,979 --> 01:55:27,647
Of course they are!

1261
01:55:27,814 --> 01:55:30,817
- Crane?
- No. Scarecrow.

1262
01:55:32,569 --> 01:55:33,987
Gordon...

1263
01:55:34,154 --> 01:55:36,406
...there's nobody left to send in.

1264
01:55:37,908 --> 01:55:39,618
So I'm on my own?

1265
01:55:43,705 --> 01:55:45,373
The Narrows is tearing itself to pieces.

1266
01:55:45,540 --> 01:55:48,126
This is just the beginning.
If they hit the whole city...

1267
01:55:48,293 --> 01:55:51,046
...there's nothing to stop Gotham
tearing itself apart.

1268
01:55:51,213 --> 01:55:53,131
- How are they gonna do that?
- The train.

1269
01:55:53,298 --> 01:55:57,135
<i>The monorail follows the water mains to
the central hub beneath Wayne Tower.</i>

1270
01:55:57,302 --> 01:55:59,012
<i>If the machine gets to the station...</i>

1271
01:55:59,179 --> 01:56:02,682
...it'll cause a chain reaction
that'll vaporize the city's water supply.

1272
01:56:02,849 --> 01:56:04,434
Covering Gotham in this poison.

1273
01:56:04,601 --> 01:56:07,813
I'm gonna stop him from loading
that train, but I may need your help.

1274
01:56:07,979 --> 01:56:09,773
- What do you need?
- Can you drive stick?

1275
01:56:16,029 --> 01:56:17,697
There you are!

1276
01:56:17,864 --> 01:56:19,866
There is nothing to fear...

1277
01:56:20,033 --> 01:56:21,785
...but fear itself!

1278
01:56:22,828 --> 01:56:24,579
I am here to help you!

1279
01:56:56,403 --> 01:56:58,572
Batman will save us. He'll come.

1280
01:57:03,743 --> 01:57:05,704
- He'll come.
- Don't peek.

1281
01:57:14,337 --> 01:57:17,716
This is Gordon.
Prepare to lower the bridge.

1282
01:57:23,597 --> 01:57:25,724
I told you he'd come.

1283
01:57:30,729 --> 01:57:32,355
Wait.

1284
01:57:33,273 --> 01:57:34,941
You could die.

1285
01:57:35,108 --> 01:57:36,401
At least tell me your name.

1286
01:57:41,781 --> 01:57:43,992
It's not who I am underneath...

1287
01:57:44,951 --> 01:57:49,372
...but what I do that defines me.

1288
01:57:49,623 --> 01:57:50,957
Bruce?

1289
01:58:24,658 --> 01:58:27,994
Well, well. You took my advice
about theatricality a bit literally.

1290
01:58:28,161 --> 01:58:30,664
- It ends here.
- For you and the police, maybe.

1291
01:58:30,830 --> 01:58:33,166
My fight, however,
lies with the rest of Gotham.

1292
01:58:33,333 --> 01:58:36,670
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a city to destroy.

1293
01:58:36,836 --> 01:58:40,548
- I can't beat two of your pawns?
- As you wish.

1294
01:58:53,353 --> 01:58:55,689
<i>GPS online.</i>

1295
01:59:02,529 --> 01:59:04,698
<i>In 100 yards.</i>

1296
01:59:35,603 --> 01:59:36,896
Gentlemen.

1297
02:00:04,257 --> 02:00:06,551
Who the hell authorized this?

1298
02:00:17,103 --> 02:00:19,189
<i>Distance to Wayne Tower, three miles.</i>

1299
02:00:26,446 --> 02:00:29,074
The pressure's moving along the mains,
blowing the pipes.

1300
02:00:29,240 --> 02:00:30,617
If that pressure reaches us...

1301
02:00:30,784 --> 02:00:33,787
...the water supply right across
the whole city is gonna blow!

1302
02:00:44,255 --> 02:00:47,133
<i>At the next intersection, turn right.</i>

1303
02:01:11,825 --> 02:01:13,284
You will never learn.

1304
02:01:20,834 --> 02:01:21,835
Sorry.

1305
02:01:25,839 --> 02:01:28,842
- Familiar. Don't you have anything new?
- How about this?!

1306
02:01:45,608 --> 02:01:47,861
<i>You have arrived at Wayne Tower.</i>

1307
02:02:01,207 --> 02:02:02,459
Evacuate the building.

1308
02:02:02,667 --> 02:02:05,170
We're on top of the main hub
and it's gonna blow.

1309
02:02:14,053 --> 02:02:16,264
<i>Weapons system activated.</i>

1310
02:02:20,351 --> 02:02:21,394
Nice ride.

1311
02:02:36,576 --> 02:02:37,660
<i>Armed.</i>

1312
02:02:49,589 --> 02:02:51,049
Don't be afraid, Bruce.

1313
02:02:53,843 --> 02:02:55,220
Come on. Come on.

1314
02:02:59,933 --> 02:03:02,060
You are just an ordinary man in a cape.

1315
02:03:02,227 --> 02:03:06,105
That's why you couldn't fight injustice,
that's why you can't stop this train.

1316
02:03:06,272 --> 02:03:08,858
Who said anything about stopping it?

1317
02:03:14,614 --> 02:03:16,199
Yes!

1318
02:03:24,374 --> 02:03:27,794
You never learned
to mind your surroundings!

1319
02:03:35,635 --> 02:03:38,137
Have you finally learned to do
what is necessary?

1320
02:03:38,429 --> 02:03:40,723
I won't kill you...

1321
02:03:45,144 --> 02:03:47,313
...but I don't have to save you.

1322
02:05:02,472 --> 02:05:05,558
- The meeting's already started.
- What meeting?

1323
02:05:09,812 --> 02:05:12,732
Fox, I seem to remember firing you.

1324
02:05:13,232 --> 02:05:14,817
You did.

1325
02:05:14,984 --> 02:05:17,070
I got another job.

1326
02:05:17,904 --> 02:05:19,364
Yours.

1327
02:05:19,822 --> 02:05:21,532
On whose authority?

1328
02:05:22,033 --> 02:05:24,077
Batman may
have made the front page...

1329
02:05:24,243 --> 02:05:27,205
...but Bruce Wayne
got pushed to page eight.

1330
02:05:34,003 --> 02:05:35,046
Bruce Wayne.

1331
02:05:35,213 --> 02:05:39,008
What makes you think you can decide
who's running Wayne Enterprises?

1332
02:05:39,175 --> 02:05:42,053
- The fact that I'm the owner.
<i>- What are you talking about?</i>

1333
02:05:42,220 --> 02:05:44,097
The company went public a week ago.

1334
02:05:44,263 --> 02:05:45,723
And I bought most of the shares.

1335
02:05:46,099 --> 02:05:49,560
<i>Through various charitable foundations
and trusts and so forth.</i>

1336
02:05:49,727 --> 02:05:52,939
Look, it's all a bit technical,
but the important thing...

1337
02:05:53,106 --> 02:05:56,442
<i>...is that my company's future
is secure.</i>

1338
02:05:56,776 --> 02:05:58,236
Right, Mr. Fox?

1339
02:05:58,403 --> 02:06:00,238
Right you are, Mr. Wayne.

1340
02:06:02,448 --> 02:06:04,033
Didn't you get the memo?

1341
02:06:22,969 --> 02:06:26,139
- I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Rachel.
- No. No, Bruce...

1342
02:06:26,305 --> 02:06:27,724
...I'm sorry.

1343
02:06:28,599 --> 02:06:31,269
The day that Chill died, l...

1344
02:06:33,146 --> 02:06:34,772
I said terrible things.

1345
02:06:35,273 --> 02:06:37,024
But true things.

1346
02:06:37,650 --> 02:06:39,485
I was a coward with a gun...

1347
02:06:39,652 --> 02:06:43,448
...and justice is about more
than revenge, so thank you.

1348
02:06:44,490 --> 02:06:47,160
I never stopped thinking about you.

1349
02:06:48,661 --> 02:06:50,288
About us.

1350
02:06:50,913 --> 02:06:52,832
And when I heard you were back, l...

1351
02:06:53,666 --> 02:06:55,918
I started to hope.

1352
02:07:19,984 --> 02:07:22,695
But then I found out about your mask.

1353
02:07:23,863 --> 02:07:26,699
Batman's just a symbol, Rachel.

1354
02:07:27,325 --> 02:07:28,993
No. This...

1355
02:07:30,161 --> 02:07:31,871
...is your mask.

1356
02:07:33,831 --> 02:07:37,376
Your real face is the one
that criminals now fear.

1357
02:07:38,211 --> 02:07:40,213
The man I loved...

1358
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:42,381
...the man who vanished...

1359
02:07:43,591 --> 02:07:45,718
...he never came back at all.

1360
02:07:50,223 --> 02:07:52,892
But maybe he's still
out there somewhere.

1361
02:07:55,061 --> 02:07:58,731
Maybe someday,
when Gotham no longer needs Batman...

1362
02:07:59,816 --> 02:08:01,734
...I'll see him again.

1363
02:08:12,829 --> 02:08:15,748
- Proved me wrong, you know.
- About what?

1364
02:08:18,584 --> 02:08:21,045
Your father would be very proud of you.

1365
02:08:21,254 --> 02:08:22,880
Just like me.

1366
02:08:49,866 --> 02:08:51,742
What will you do?

1367
02:08:53,119 --> 02:08:54,704
Rebuild it.

1368
02:08:55,580 --> 02:08:57,957
Just the way it was, brick for brick.

1369
02:09:04,797 --> 02:09:06,048
Just the way it was, sir?

1370
02:09:08,134 --> 02:09:09,385
Yeah, why?

1371
02:09:09,552 --> 02:09:12,388
I thought this might be
a good opportunity for...

1372
02:09:12,555 --> 02:09:14,974
...improving the foundations.

1373
02:09:15,182 --> 02:09:18,144
- In the southeast corner?
- Precisely, sir.

1374
02:09:33,826 --> 02:09:36,704
- Nice.
- I couldn't find any mob bosses.

1375
02:09:37,663 --> 02:09:40,333
- Well, sergeant?
- It's "lieutenant" now.

1376
02:09:40,708 --> 02:09:42,168
You really started something.

1377
02:09:42,335 --> 02:09:44,337
Bent cops running scared.

1378
02:09:44,503 --> 02:09:45,963
Hope on the streets.

1379
02:09:46,213 --> 02:09:49,842
- But?
- The Narrows is lost.

1380
02:09:50,343 --> 02:09:54,180
And we still haven't picked up Crane or
half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.

1381
02:09:54,847 --> 02:09:56,515
We will.

1382
02:09:56,724 --> 02:09:58,351
We can bring Gotham back.

1383
02:09:58,517 --> 02:10:01,020
- What about escalation?
- Escalation?

1384
02:10:01,228 --> 02:10:05,524
We start carrying semiautomatics,
they buy automatics.

1385
02:10:05,733 --> 02:10:10,029
We start wearing Kevlar,
they buy armor-piercing rounds.

1386
02:10:10,237 --> 02:10:13,532
- And?
- And you're wearing a mask...

1387
02:10:13,950 --> 02:10:15,826
...and jumping off rooftops.

1388
02:10:17,244 --> 02:10:19,288
Now, take this guy.

1389
02:10:19,538 --> 02:10:21,540
Armed robbery, double homicide.

1390
02:10:21,749 --> 02:10:25,002
Got a taste for the theatrical, like you.

1391
02:10:25,252 --> 02:10:27,213
Leaves a calling card.

1392
02:10:33,052 --> 02:10:34,887
I'll look into it.

1393
02:10:38,391 --> 02:10:39,850
I never said thank you.

1394
02:10:44,897 --> 02:10:47,024
And you'll never have to.
