1
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,039
<i>Get me in ten minutes, Ray.</i>

2
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,230
<i>Boss.</i>

3
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,631
- Bobby.
- Boss?

4
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,551
I'll have a pint and a pickled egg.

5
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,235
Coming straight up.

6
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,160
<i>If you wish to be the king of the jungle,</i>

7
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,470
<i>it's not enough to act like a king.</i>

8
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,993
<i>You must be the king.</i>

9
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,953
<i>And there can be no doubt.</i>

10
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,119
Because doubt causes chaos
and one's own demise.

11
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,595
Hello, my love.

12
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,953
It's date night tonight.

13
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,077
Nine o'clock, you and I, River Cafe.

14
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,435
Who's there?

15
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,589

Fletcher.

44
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,440
<i>Buenas tardes, Raymondo.</i>

45
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,593
I should stab you
with that fucking rolling pin.

46
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,079
Oh, don't be cunty.

47
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,629
I was just hoping we could have
a cozy little drink together.

48
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,837
So, I've got a meeting on Saturday
at your favorite newspaper.

49
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,431
As the best private investigator
in this smoky little town...

50
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,272
good evening, ladies and gentlemen...

51
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,877
they are ready to put 150 grand
in my pocket to give them some filth.

52
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,395
Good for me, that, but in this case...

53
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,110
it's bad for you.

54
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,514
So Big Dave, editor extraordinaire,

55
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,480
has developed a terrible antipathy
for your boss

56
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,154
and his liquorish assortment
of tasty mates.

57
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,995
He's out to destroy him
and all those that cozy up to him.

58
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,514
Front cover. Bosh!

59
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,910
There will be blood and fucking feathers
everywhere, my darling.

60
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,149
Get to it, Fletcher. I'm starting to itch.

61
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,312
Now, we both know that your boss
has very, very deep pockets,

62
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,392
and I would like to invite him
just to have a teeny rummage in them.

63
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,678
What the fuck are you talking about?

64
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:18,116
If you would be so kind as to furnish me
with 20 million British pounds,

65
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,032
I will give you everything...

66
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,078
memory cards, contact sheets,
recordings, the lot,

67
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,676
and a modest little screenplay
I wrote all by myself.

68
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,830
Hold on.

69
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,354
We just went from £150,000 to 20 million.

70
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,317
That's a steep rise in 30 seconds.

71
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,438
Yeah, but I would argue that you're lucky,
because that is nothing

72
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,115
compared to what I could,
and perhaps should, be asking.

73
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,352
Oh, well, thank God
you're not greedy, Fletcher,

74
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,670
you deluded, shit-eating cunt.

75
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,751
I quite like it when you talk dirty to me.

76
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,991
I can feel myself engorging.

77
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,349
Come on, have a drink with me.
It's really yummy.

78
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,151
I looked it up. App-ed it. 1500 quid?

79
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,834
I didn't know you could spend that much
on a bottle of scotch.

80
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,396
I'm gonna tell you a story to demonstrate
why my quote is my quote.

81
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,353
Will you play a game with me, Ray?

82
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,874
I don't wanna play a game.

83
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,400
Please?

84
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,872
I said play a fucking game with me, Ray.

85
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,750
Right.

86
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,230
Lovely.

87
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,475
Now, I want you to imagine a character,

88
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,911
a dramatic character,
like in a book or a play or a film.

89
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,435
But not digital, not on a memory stick.

90
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,195
Analog. Chemical process.
"Keep the grain in the picture, “ I say.

91
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,679
Old-school, 35 mill.

92
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,398
Now, I'm seeing this through a lens, I am,

93
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,471
and I'm not talking about
the small screen.

94
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,198
It's not TV, Raymond.

95
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,193
As I said, old-school cinema format.

96
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,989
It's what we in the business
called anamorphic, or ratio 2.35 to 1.

97
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,038
And I want you to join me
on this cinematic journey,

98
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,952
'cause it is cinema, Ray.

99
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,953
It's beautiful, beautiful cinema.

100
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,309
Now, roll camera.

101
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,035
<i>Enter our protagonist.</i>

102
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,157
<i>He's good-looking, he's gorgeous,</i>

103
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,756
<i>he's golden age,
he's a proper handsome cunt.</i>

104
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,629
<i>His name is Mickey Pearson.</i>

105
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,870
Unique background has our Mickey.

106
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,909
<i>American born, Rhodes scholar,
so he is born clever but poor.</i>

107
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,719
<i>Now, that's quite a leap
from a trailer park in Americana</i>

108
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,758
<i>to the thousand-year-old university
in old</i> Angleterre,

109
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,117
<i>where he studies
the dark art of horticulture.</i>

110
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,318
But he never finished his education,
never went home, because...

111
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,789
<i>he found his vocation.</i>

112
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,791
<i>A naughty vocation.</i>

113
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,393
<i>Hats 3 bad boy.</i>

114
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,199
<i>He starts dealing the dirty wonder weed</i>

115
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,636
<i>to his rich, British, upper-class uni pals</i>

116
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,075
<i>and realizes he's rather good at it.</i>

117
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,993
<i>He's clear and objective about ambition</i>

118
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,550
<i>and he can surf the echelons
of our complicated culture.</i>

119
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,435
<i>He knew how to take advantage
of his advantage.</i>

120
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,879
<i>He was a hungry animal, you see.</i>

121
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,316
<i>He was powerful and ruthless,
cunning and quick,</i>

122
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,630
<i>charismatic and smart, but...</i>

123
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,519
<i>he had to do some naughty things
to get Where he got,</i>

124
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,432
<i>to establish his position,</i>

125
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,160
<i>to Show he wasn't just
teeth, tits and tan.</i>

126
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,917
Well, he wasn't fucking hollow, was he?

127
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,033
<i>He had an engine under his hood
and a gun in his holster.</i>

128
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,033
So, he's not exactly clean, our Mickey.

129
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,918
He has come up the hard way.

130
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,674
He's earned his position, shall we say.

131
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,159
<i>Well, that was the early days,</i>

132
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,636
<i>and he cracked on
with his New World pioneer spirit.</i>

133
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,955
What's he worth today?
100, 200, 500 million?

134
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,720
But now the plot begins to thicken.

135
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,440
He has reached a crossroads in his life.

136
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,796
The middle class and the middle age,
they've got to him.

137
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,275
They've corrupted his appetite
for the horrors.

138
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,350
He's gone soft.

139
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,353
He wanted to cash in his chips
and get out of the game,

140
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,080
and he seems to have found
the perfect customer.

141
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,434
Smash cut, please...

142
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,071
<i>to interior, a gala dinner.</i>

143
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,993
Just a few words to say thank you
to Michael Pearson

144
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,720
for his limitless generosity and time.

145
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,317
Now, Mickey has been cultivating
a special relationship

146
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,712
<i>with the erudite, learned
and broad-minded Matthew Berger.</i>

147
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,236
Yes, Raymond, I do know about
the Jewish billionaire cowboy,

148
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,438
another slice of Americana
creating drama in <i>Angleterre.</i>

149
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,514
And finally to Matthew Berger
blindsiding us with his donation

150
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,230
to build the entire
cognitive behavioral therapy unit.

151
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,596
<i>So these two have met before.
Fuck knows Where.</i>

152
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,753
<i>Presumably at the annual international
drug dealers convention in Las Vegas.</i>

153
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,990
<i>And they've done
some small deals together,</i>

154
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,640
<i>but now they're ready for the big one.</i>

155
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,439
Well, that was unexpected, Matthew.

156
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,276
Now I understand why you're seated
at the head of the table.

157
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,113
Snuck that one right by me,
didn't you, you naughty little girl?

158
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,471
Making a splash with the gentry.

159
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,074
Oh, I like to make a splash
whenever possible.

160
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,719
Well, you also seem to understand
the significance of a proper attire.

161
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,949
Indeed I do.

162
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,158
I believe a sense of ownership
is vital in every aspect of life,

163
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,709
perhaps never more so
than when it comes to wardrobe.

164
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,509
For every look there is a season,
and for every season a strategy.

165
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,069
<i>Now starts the alpha dance.</i>

166
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,037
<i>They're not really
talking about clothes, Raymond.</i>

167
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,269
<i>Oh, fucking no.</i>

168
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,351
<i>They're like a pair of old doggies</i>

169
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,954
<i>sniffing round one another's
intellectual assholes.</i>

170
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,953
<i>It's a good old-fashioned cock-off,
Raymond.</i>

171
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,759
Michael, I'm looking forward
to doing business together.

172
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,515
- May we excuse ourselves?
- Yes, please.

173
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,431
We should say good night to our host.

174
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,633
So what do you think?

175
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,394
I'm not sure.

176
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,790
Your Grace.

177
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:07,157
He's a fox,
and foxes have a predictable nature.

178
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,197
Trust this Jew about that Jew.

179
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,395
If you let him in the henhouse,

180
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,551
you can expect blood
and feathers everywhere.

181
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,309
Fresh from a farmyard pheasant shoot,

182
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,199
these two are starting to like each other.

183
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,840
It's looking good, Ray.
It's looking fucking good.

184
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,319
I'm impressed with what you've done

185
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,515
with your enterprise.

186
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,989
You see, try as I might,
I can't work out how you do it,

187
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,753
and bush is my game.

188
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,354
How does anyone grow
50 tons of super skunk

189
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,590
without letting anyone else know
how they do it?

190
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,069
I'm flattered to hear that from you,
Matthew.

191
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,629
I imagine that big brain of yours
is sweating a stream of tears

192
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,279
just trying to figure it out.

193
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,759
Brilliance should be acknowledged.

194
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,114
Mm.

195
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,992
Run the numbers by me again.

196
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,710
200 million gross p.a., 100 million net.

197
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,074
But your people know this already.

198
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,470
They've swept the numbers for months now.

199
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,440
The bottom line is
I'll sell it to you for 400 million.

200
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,235
But you knew that already. Hop in.

201
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,039
<i>Now, I can '1' be specific
about the heroes and zeros,</i>

202
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,680
but there was a lot of money
hanging in the balance.

203
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,276
Question: What would it be worth
to have the power

204
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,874
to be able to pull the plug
on an operation like that?

205
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,079
Answer: A greedy man would want
half the sale price,

206
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,357
but a smart man would know
that 20 million pounds

207
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,796
was just about uncomfortable enough
to make everyone feel comfortable.

208
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,792
You're a cunning and creative toad,
aren't you, Fletcher,

209
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,598
coming up with a plan like this?

210
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,956
Yeah, but I didn't really
come up with it, did I?

211
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,235
It was Big Dave.

212
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,118
He commissioned me to do a job on Mickey,

213
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,873
you know, sniff about, keep an eye on him,

214
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,678
go through his bins, reveal his sins.

215
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,073
Mickey Pearson,
the odious Yankee gangster.

216
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,559
We're gonna bury him.

217
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,469
Because it seems he's got himself
a new friend. Lord Pressfield.

218
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,513
Question: Is that <i>the</i> Lord Pressfield?

219
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,269
<i>His Grace, the duke?</i>

220
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,034
Yeah. Once fourth in line to the throne.

221
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,838
Apparently Mickey Pearson
has squeaked his way

222
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,070
into the crack of his fat, posh ass.

223
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,350
This is yours, Fletcher.

224
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,829
I need a man with your creativity,
with your nose.

225
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,638
Now, you know
you're my favorite bloodhound.

226
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,156
I just think it's really important
to remember who you're talking to, Dave.

227
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,478
Of course I remember, Fletcher.

228
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,598
So just make absolutely sure
the check doesn't disappoint this time.

229
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,232
The number is 150,000.

230
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,320
He wants to ruin him,

231
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,472
but I am here to do you a favor.

232
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,479
And it's not like you're not
getting something for your money.

233
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:34,678
You could even turn that script
into a feature film, Raymond.

234
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,680
We could make it together.
We could be partners.

235
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,912
I have learned off you lot.

236
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,675
You gotta look after number one,
and now it's my turn.

237
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,389
The sun is not going up for me, Ray.
It's going down.

238
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,878
So why has Big Dave got it in for my boss?

239
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,076
Two months ago, your man Mickey

240
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,993
<i>made my man Dave
feel like a right fucking idiot.</i>

241
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,798
Henry. Mickey.

242
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,069
How did he do that?

243
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,559
Didn't accept his hand.

244
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,790
- Dave. <i>Daily Print.</i>
- Yes.

245
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,391
No. Editor of the <i>Daily Print.</i>

246
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,518
<i>Turns out Dave had gone after
one of Mickey's lords,</i>

247
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,238
<i>did a proper tabloid job on him.</i>

248
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,789
<i>It would appear that His Lordship
had had a quick spin</i>

249
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:18,394
<i>on one of his attractive young footmen.</i>

250
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,114
<i>After the splash, shares crashed,
job went, wife followed,</i>

251
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,157
<i>and even his kids disowned him.</i>

252
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,629
<i>Well, that Dave can't half be a cunt.</i>

253
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,680
But no one will pull him on it.

254
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,115
Too fucking scared that Dave
will do a feature on them.

255
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,517
<i>But your Mickey,
he's got a fabulous set of balls.</i>

256
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,718
So he snubbed him in front of a crowd
that Dave could only wish he belonged to.

257
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,111
You know, lords and ladies, the sort that
Mickey feels very comfortable in front of.

258
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,958
Men, excuse us.

259
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,156
<i>Well, he might just as well
have pulled Dave is cock off.</i>

260
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,992
I do believe that was a bit
of a fuck off, Dave.

261
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,310
<i>'Cause he just fizzled
like a party balloon.</i>

262
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,599
That's no reason to go after a fella.

263
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,155
Well, I don't know what to tell you.
He wants Mickey's blood.

264
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,234
And he would be getting it too,
if it wasn't for...

265
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,716
You're a filthy fantasist,
and now it's time to leave.

266
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,111
Oh, don't be silly.
I'm only just lubing you up.

267
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,149
Now, there is a reason why Matthew,
or anyone else for that matter,

268
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,352
cannot work out
how Mickey does what he does.

269
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,195
How does he grow 50 tons
of white widow super cheese every year?

270
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,317
Everyone knows that needs a lot of space.

271
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,756
So where is the space
and how come he's kept it under wraps?

272
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,071
<i>You can't just dig a hole in the ground
and drop 200 shipping containers in there.</i>

273
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,798
<i>Oh, no, my love. That will not work.</i>

274
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,714
No. You have to be creative.
You need an angle.

275
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,679
The problem with land in this country
is there's not much of it...

276
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,998
<i>and there's public access even
when it's supposed to be private.</i>

277
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,518
And the public have rights: dog walkers...

278
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,193
Yes, jog on.

279
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,794
<i>...footpaths, right to roam,</i>

280
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,393
<i>bimblers, ramblers,</i>

281
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,879
<i>badger lovers...</i>

282
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,600
<i>...and any other busy cunt
with enough time on his hands</i>

283
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,193
to sniff the green tweed of England.

284
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,793
Good morning!

285
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,359
And they have groups,

286
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,556
<i>forums, meetings,</i>

287
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,039
<i>social media,</i>

288
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,031
<i>and they love a good chat and a hiss</i>

289
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,919
about anyone who's decided
to mow his lawn without a license.

290
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,351
And then there's the helicopters,
drones, Google Earth,

291
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,477
<i>heritage sites, parish councils,</i>

292
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,994
and the beat goes on.

293
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,149
And that's before you even think
about getting power in here.

294
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,638
So what is Mickey's unique method?

295
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,237
I tip my cap at the cheek,
at the elegance, at the class.

296
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,037
And what would that method be exactly?

297
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,430
You have to understand a culture
to understand a man.

298
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,992
<i>Toffs, aristocrats,</i>

299
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,118
<i>dukes, duchesses, lords and ladies,</i>

300
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,111
lots of land and fuck all dough.

301
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,034
<i>Houses to keep, damp to keep out,
silver to polish.</i>

302
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,158
You must remember
that cash is very persuasive

303
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,676
<i>to the class that got spanked
by angry lefties and death duties.</i>

304
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,515
<i>And every time you inherit a fortune,
you lose half to the state.</i>

305
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,750
<i>So this is my moment to swoop in</i>

306
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,797
<i>like a guardian fucking angel</i>

307
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,350
<i>and offer my services so they can
keep their houses in order.</i>

308
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,556
And they're not too bothered
about what I do,

309
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,272
<i>as long as that cash
keeps rolling in each year.</i>

310
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,153
It's good to get 3 lord, yes,
but it's not easy.

311
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,949
It takes work, wine, women and disco.

312
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,473
<i>Twelve sites. Twelve farms.</i>

313
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,439
<i>One thousand of these estates
in the great UK.</i>

314
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,557
<i>Bonne chance</i> trying to find them all.

315
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,752
That's it. My infrastructure.

316
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,351
And that, sir, is, with my blessing,
what you are paying for.

317
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,879
If it's as discreet and as lucrative
as you claim it is,

318
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,871
I'll buy the whole business.

319
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,633
But enough foreplay, Michael.

320
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,634
I wanna see your plant.

321
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,036
I've gone to great lengths
to make my operation

322
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,714
as invisible as possible, Matthew.

323
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,189
If you were standing on my bush,
you wouldn't know it.

324
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,791
As a matter of fact,
you are standing on my bush.

325
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,837
It's a spectacular business, Michael.

326
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,757
Such a shame
it will go bankrupt in ten years

327
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,956
when things go legal in the great UK.

328
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,910
And you want me to pay top dollar for it?

329
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,231
A nugget under half a yard?

330
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,669
That is the price.

331
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,400
Now step inside and I'll show you
what half a yard gets you.

332
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,997
Ooh. A delightful tool shed
for 400 million dollars.

333
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,511
Is the ball-peen hammer included?

334
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,479
Course it is.
Now let me show you the nails.

335
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,555
Watch your head.

336
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,640
Carry on, chaps.

337
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,070
England's green and pleasant land.

338
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,759
Those are some nails.

339
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,550
Location, staff, technology.

340
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,954
See, you're buying the substructure
for the superstructure to come,

341
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,309
and with purchase you will inherit
the best sites available,

342
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,552
the finest botanists
and herb sommeliers in the world,

343
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,395
as well as the most innovative
marijuana technology on the planet.

344
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,960
And when this little piggy
goes to legal market

345
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,072
and the demand way outpaces the supply...

346
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,516
these locations,
these green-fingered botanical boys,

347
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,989
as well as my superior technology,

348
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,309
will be at a premium.

349
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,154
And you would own them all.

350
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,113
Did you know it took 15 years after
alcohol prohibition ended back home

351
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,271
for the legal market to scratch that itch?

352
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,872
Fifteen years.

353
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,591
And that's if you do nothing with it.

354
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,999
Yes, it's a win-win,
no matter how you look at it.

355
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,829
And I'm not greedy.

356
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:08,118
You and I both know that 400 million
is a fair-to-generous asking price,

357
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,509
especially considering
that once this game's kosher,

358
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,479
it's going to be worth
somewhere between 200 billion

359
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,757
and, well, half a trillion pounds.

360
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,435
Annually.

361
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,479
Weed.

362
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,789
Bush.

363
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,873
Skunk-amola.

364
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,836
White widow super cheese.

365
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,634
It's the new gold rush.

366
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,833
This is the thin end
of a very fat wedge, sir.

367
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,439
If it's such a fat wedge,
why don't you keep it?

368
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,838
You see, I've developed a reputation
as a man who came up the hard way.

369
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,758
You could say that there's blood
on these pretty white hands.

370
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,754
But in the new business,
once legal and under the jurisdiction

371
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,993
of the respectable umbrella
of ministerial legitimacy,

372
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,675
an enterprise like this
will need a face with a clean past,

373
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,116
which sadly I do not possess.

374
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,316
Retirement doesn't sound so bad.

375
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,916
Long walks in the countryside,
pruning roses with my better half,

376
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,399
raising some cubs.

377
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:14,040
I've earned it.

378
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,714
Look, we both know growing
is only 50% of the business.

379
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,631
I need your European connections.

380
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,836
I've seen how the sausage is made.

381
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,433
Now tell me about the butcher shops.

382
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,198
Well, that comes later, Matthew,

383
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,553
when the money's in escrow.

384
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,110
Now that we've established
the dilemma of our protagonist,

385
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,840
let us turn to our antagonist.

386
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,753
Many miles away, across the open plains,

387
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,193
another beautiful feral beast
lopes his way to a watering hole.

388
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,634
Who are you talking about now?

389
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,640
I talk, Raymondo, of Dry Eye.

390
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,154
Oh, Dry Eye.

391
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,119
What is he?
Chinese? Japanese? Pekingese?

392
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,713
Get on your fucking knees?

393
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,438
Dirty dragon filth.

394
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,751
<i>fl Yellow is the color
Gambling is the game ♪</i>

395
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,196
He explodes on the scene
like a millennial fucking firecracker.

396
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,310
Bang, bang, bang.

397
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,437
You Ghee-bye motherfuckers!

398
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,352
<i>I'm gonna have to stop you
fig/71177616, Fletcher.</i>

399
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,832
That doesn't sound like
the Dry Eye I know.

400
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,434
Just making sure
you're paying attention, Raymond.

401
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,309
<i>So let's cut instead
to a somewhat anticlimactic</i>

402
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,233
<i>but suave and debonair Dry Eye,</i>

403
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,038

<i>"Ricense" to kill.</i>

405
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,831
- Open them up.
- Yes, boss.

406
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,314
Good Lord.

407
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,999
Hose them down, load them up
and fuck them off.

408
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,038
- Let me have a look at 432.
- Yes, boss. It's just right here.

409
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,238
There's 120 rims, uh, 32 LS engines,
60 custom...

410
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,072
All right. Pay the man.

411
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,040
Sorry, chaps. I quoted you for a 20
when it's a 40-footer.

412
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,157
It's gonna be double bubble.

413
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,076
Double bubble?

414
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,034
A gentleman's quote is a gentleman's word.

415
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,914
Now, either you or your family are
gonna have to pay for that lesson.

416
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,113
Do we have an understanding?

417
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,275
Yes, boss.

418
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,392
Give the soppy prick his money.

419
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,150
<i>Anyway, let's put a pin in Dry Eye</i>

420
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,078
and turn again to Mickey.

421
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,756
If you're thinking
of smoking that in here...

422
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,470
don't.

423
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:42,555
I find that confusing. Do you mean
don't smoke or don't think?

424
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,873
Oh...

425
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,917
Oh, all right, all right, it's going out.

426
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,914

<i>A Cockney Cleopatra

436
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,829
I'm trying to do you a favor here, Mike,

437
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,355
but every time I do you a favor,
it ends up costing me too.

438
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,750
- <i>Now, come on, Ros...</i>
- Why is Miss Kova still here?

439
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,877
That Range was supposed
to be finished this morning.

440
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,237
- I'm not talking to you, Mike.
- Sorry, boss. Rodge is on the Range.

441
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,119
How many times have I told you?
I don't want Roger up front.

442
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,714
This is a sanctuary for the ladies.
Where is he?

443
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,632
He's up in your office
with your husband.

444
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,474
Misha, darling, I'll have you
out of here in 20 minutes.

445
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,074
Rosalind, I've got a spin class
in half an hour.

446
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,032
Twenty minutes and no charge.

447
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,798
Lisa, champagne.

448
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,715
- Mike, <i>are you</i> still there?
<i>- Of course I'm still fucking here.</i>

449
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,792
Right, well, if you're still there,
who's ordering the fucking parts?

450
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,390
So what do you think?

451
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,198
Ringing the bell, but not too loud.

452
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,155
Dipped in honey.

453
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,355
That's on the money.

454
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,669
But you always could make
a good cup of tea, Mickey.

455
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,239
Very nice.

456
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,230
Hello, Ros.

457
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,839
What the fuck is going on in here?

458
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,192
I should have known
it was you behind this.

459
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,477
Rodge is supposed to be working down there
and you're up here blowing his brains out.

460
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,437
- I'm on it, boss.
- You wanna be.

461
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,513
Don't blame the Dodge, dear.

462
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,070
You know he's got a special nose
and he's doing this old dog a favor.

463
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,639
Dodge, get down there and earn your money.

464
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,835
Gone.

465
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,074
What you doing here anyway?

466
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,549
Thought I'd come by
to have a cup of tea with my wife.

467
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,317
Well, go on, then. Put the kettle on.

468
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,433
Looks like the deal's gone through.

469
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,556
- Second thoughts?
- No second thoughts.

470
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,438
I like middle age.

471
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,956
I like gentrification,
private schools, fine wines

472
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,795
and a spoonful of caviar
to help my medicine go down.

473
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,039
But most importantly,

474
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,952
I'm looking forward
to spending more time with you.

475
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,155
Course you are.

476
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,593
Look, I don't want you
knocking around here

477
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,876
feeling all unemployed
and lost with yourself.

478
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,914
Well, fuck me.

479
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,156
Most wives would beg their other halves
to get out of this game, but not you.

480
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,674
That's because I know you, darling.

481
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,037
Look, you'll have
to do this elegantly, love.

482
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,196
If word spreads that you're getting out,
that could read as weakness.

483
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,396
And if you smell smoke,
it's 'cause there's a fire,

484
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,630
and that could get expensive.

485
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,758
So you're gonna have to stamp that out
without any gentrification.

486
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,710
But not you, love.

487
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,318
Don't you do anything messy.

488
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,436
That's why you've got people, remember?

489
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,551
I fucking love you, babe.

490
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,039
Course you do.

491
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,075
Any chance?

492
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,558
No, you can wait.

493
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,310
I've got a red-hot Russki
with her finger on the trigger.

494
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,074
- Gotta deal with it.
- I don't mind the two of yous.

495
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,838
Go on, fuck off.

496
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,949
Fletcher...

497
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,919
why are you wasting our time?

498
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,029
I know what happens in my world
and what doesn't.

499
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,474
What I fail to recognize

500
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,155
is why Michael should be motivated
to write you a check for 20 million.

501
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,629
I find you very impatient, Raymond.

502
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,034
I am a storyteller.

503
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,430
As they say in the film game,
I'm laying pipe.

504
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,758
Well, you'd better
put something through it soon.

505
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,275
So what is that?
Is that a barbecue as well?

506
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,872
- Yes, it is, Fletcher.
- I love a barbie.

507
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,076
That is a useful bit of plant,
then, isn't it?

508
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,118
So that heats up your knees
and cooks at the same time?

509
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,953
You gotta show me
how to get one of them.

510
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,316
Well, you can take it with you
if you fuck off now.

511
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,669
Ray.

512
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,234
Is there any chance of a steak?

513
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,634
Yeah, all right.

514
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,031
Got a bit of Wagyu in the freezer
as it happens.

515
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,235
I've never had Wagyu.

516
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,709
Yeah, well, it'll be wasted on you,
but it's all I've got.

517
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,791
- I'll get it, mate.
- Oh, no, you're all right.

518
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,757
- Just stay right there.
- Oh.

519
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,355
Ow, fuck me!

520
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,830
It's hot.

521
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,073
He's a sly fox, that Fletcher.

522
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,233
Night-night, Aslan.

523
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,832
32 LS engines?

524
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,431
You got all these parts
on a 40-foot container?

525
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,430
Yeah.

526
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,435
How'd you get your hands on that?

527
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,276
Ask no questions, hear no lies.

528
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,710
Hence the price.

529
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,751
- So how much?
- Oh, no charge.

530
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,150
Okay, so what's the price?

531
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,514
A meeting with your husband.

532
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,592
Oh, fuck off.
That's not gonna happen.

533
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,514
It's in his interest.

534
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,038
Tell you what, keep the parts.
Consider it a gesture of goodwill.

535
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,833
You know how to get hold of me.

536
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,313
Well, I can't promise anything.

537
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,074
Dry Eye, he got his little sit-down
with Michael, didn't he?

538
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,078
Bold move, that, coming in heavy,

539
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,437
sanctioned or unsanctioned...

540
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,512
<i>by the dragon head himself, Lord George.</i>

541
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,436
<i>Well, he's a naughty boy, that George.</i>

542
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,713
<i>But Dry Eye, oh, he's next generation,</i>

543
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,918
<i>and them Chinamen, they upgrade
quicker than i-fucking-Phones.</i>

544
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,320
Is he making moves?

545
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,078
<i>Is he breaking out on his own?</i>

546
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,629
<i>Big man plans behind Lord George's back?</i>

547
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,599
To be fair, it was very nicely played
with 100 grand's worth of free car parts,

548
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:56,038
because everyone knows that the way
to a man's heart is through his wife.

549
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,432
You'd make a lovely wife, Raymond.

550
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,520
Thank you for taking the time
to see me, Michael.

551
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,799
Lord George sends his best.

552
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,918
I only took this meeting
because Ros asked me to.

553
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,957
Make sure to never
approach her like that again.

554
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,358
I meant no disrespect.

555
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,709
How can I help?

556
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,194
I understand you're getting out.

557
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,313
Getting out. Getting out of what?

558
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,471
Bed? My head? The closet?

559
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,031
Don't flirt with me, Dry Eye.
I'm a busy man.

560
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,757
I hear you're getting out of the game.

561
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,470
And I would like you to consider an offer.

562
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,789
Look, I'm gonna stop you right there

563
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,190
so you don't waste any more
of your precious breath, young man.

564
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,430
This is not a discussion
for the two of us.

565
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,551
Unlike the salt and pepper,
it's not on the table.

566
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,515
This is a big number.

567
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,590
Cash.

568
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,671
I am not for sale.

569
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,639
And even if I was,
you're several zeros short.

570
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,950
Now, you may be able
to buy your man's sausage for that,

571
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,236
but to me it just looks rude at breakfast.

572
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,950
You're out of touch.

573
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,312
You're forgetting the laws of the jungle,
looking down on me.

574
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,558
Now, when the silverback's
got more silver than back...

575
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,954
he best move on...

576
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,480
before he gets moved on.

577
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,199
It's not dignified.

578
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,000
It's beneath you, Michael.
Trying to do you a favor.

579
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,150
This is a big fucking number.

580
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,634
And this?

581
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,158
This is a big fucking gun.

582
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,193
Eyes not so dry now, are they?

583
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:44,790
Hurts, does it?

584
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,590
You looking for your balls
or a hole in the wall?

585
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,320
- Fuck!
- Where the fuck do you think you're going?

586
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,631
Because you're not going out
the way you came in,

587
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,159
you deluded duck-eating cunt.

588
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,952
Talking to me
about the laws of the jungle.

589
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,793
What was it?
Something about being beneath me?

590
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,279
Silver on back?

591
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,989
There's only one rule
in this fucking jungle.

592
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,393
When the lion's hungry, he eats.

593
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,349
<i>You're wrong, Fletcher.</i>

594
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,158
That's not how Michael works.

595
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,318
Yeah, I know. I know.
I was just having a bit of fun.

596
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,552
Every movie needs a bit of action,
doesn't it?

597
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,597
And it's not like
Michael doesn't have a reputation.

598
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,512
Had a reputation.

599
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,719
He's been gentrified.

600
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,632
<i>...big fucking number.</i>

601
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,438
I know how you lot love fables,
so let me share a little fable with you.

602
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,350
There once was a young and foolish dragon

603
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,750
who came to ask a wise and cunning lion

604
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,911
about acquiring his territory.

605
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,072
Now, the lion, he wasn't interested,
so he told the little dragon to fuck off.

606
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,029
But the dragon couldn't understand
what “fuck off“ meant,

607
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,078
so he persisted
and continued to ask the lion

608
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,117
about acquiring his territory.

609
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,039
So the lion
took the little dragon for a walk

610
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,800
and put five bullets
in his little dragon head.

611
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,880
End of story.

612
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,393
Now, allegedly there's a message in there.

613
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,711
I don't know what it is,
but you're a clever boy, Dry Eye.

614
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,558
Maybe you can explain it to me.

615
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,273
I think your time's up, chaps.

616
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,710
Michael, you should recons...

617
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,515
Just marinade on it.

618
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,593
In the meantime, fuck off.

619
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,351
Oh, I bet Mickey was pleased
he took that meeting, wasn't he?

620
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,750
Yes, it went very well.

621
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,831
- Yeah.
- Do you want the top or the bottom?

622
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,919
The bottom, please, darling.

623
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,554
Now, things started to unravel
after that meeting.

624
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,439
Didn't Mickey get a rat infestation
at one of his farms?

625
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,835
Come on.

626
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,439
Stealth, stealth.

627
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,790
Go.

628
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,354
Ballys down.

629
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,392
Let's move. Go, go, go, go.

630
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,190
Shit.

631
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,679
Oh, my days.

632
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,714
Fucking hell.

633
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,714
He said there'd be a bit of puff.

634
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,279
Yeah, they weren't joking.

635
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,593
Oi, fellas. It's already packed.

636
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,829
Let's not mess about.

637
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,280
Let's load it up, boys.

638
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,434
Who the fuck are you lot?

639
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,272
Fuck. Cover up.

640
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,229
Do you know who owns this gaff?

641
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,955
We don't give a fuck.

642
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,953
I think you got off on the wrong stop.

643
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,354
Oi, Tezza!

644
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,829
- What?
- Fancy a row?

645
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,275
Who are these jokers?

646
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,714
They want our gear.

647
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,470
Marv!

648
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,590
Who's this cunt?

649
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,389
John!

650
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,517
Oh, hello. It's Dad's Army.

651
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,874
Oi, Frank.

652
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,311
What's this? Teddy bears' picnic?

653
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,993
Oi, Mo!

654
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,311
Any more rabbits in that warren?

655
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,549
You lads fancy a warm-up?

656
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,039
Not for you Jelly Babies.

657
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,269
On three, lads.

658
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,870
Three.

659
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,835
Hey!

660
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,957
What? You wanna call him back, Grandad?

661
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,994
Fuck!

662
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,115
Boss, let me get two burgers on the stove.
Get that quick, understand?

663
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,157
And I want two chips as well.

664
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,277
What is this smell of wee in here?

665
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,079
Who the fuck is this joke, man?

666
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,878
Don't stand near me, son.

667
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,194
You got your mouthwash muddled up
with cat piss.

668
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,599
Take two steps back and wait your turn.

669
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,390
You better fuck off, old man,
or I'll wet you.

670
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,596
The only thing you can wet's
your underpants, son.

671
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,159
Now, back two steps.

672
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,440
Trigger. That's you. Go on.

673
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,238
- That's you. You're up, bruv.
- Yeah?

674
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,233
- Do him. Fucking do him, lad.
- Stick it in him, bruv.

675
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,630
Now, if you're gonna stab, stab, Trigger.

676
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,114
Don't, you know, dance.

677
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,790
What are yous,
like a Four Tops tribute act or something?

678
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,118
The Foreskins. The Redskins.

679
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,998
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Here come the Indians.

680
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,720
Bit of the old Northern Soul, is it, boys?

681
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,314
Putting the gay back in Marvin Gaye.

682
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,829
I'm on fire over here, lads. Come on,
I need some back and forth. Come on.

683
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,480
What have you got for me?
Now, make it quick. Make it funny.

684
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,078
Fuck you.

685
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,389
Jeez, that's disappointing.
No, no, not that.

686
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,832
Go again. Go again.

687
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,560
Now, make it sharp. Cut me with it.

688
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,233
- Fucking do him, laddie.
- Come on.

689
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,038
Yeah. Yeah.

690
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,519
Oh, shit!

691
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,113
Come on then, you dickhead.

692
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,269
My eyes!

693
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,593
Yous are embarrassing yourself here, lads.

694
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,314
Kids stab, girls shoot, boys punch.

695
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,313
Grown-ups fight with their heads.
That's where the real battle is.

696
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,152
Up here, in the gray.

697
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,753
He sparked me out, bruv.

698
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,719
Now, wake up, lads.
Life's quick, you're slow.

699
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,393
Life's hard on a bone top.

700
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,829
Come on down the gym.
We'll see what we can do with yous.

701
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,232
Hang on. Are you the coach?

702
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,399
Coach, it's Ernie.

703
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,276
Shit. It's the fucking coach, bro.
It's the fucking coach.

704
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,069
Ernie, what is it?

705
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,594
<i>Ball's in the back of the net.</i>

706
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,590

and we're gonna include you,

707
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,795
because you're our mentor.

708
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,554
I don't know what you're talking about,
but I don't like the sound of it.

709
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,389
- We've landed a load of sticky bush.
- I <i>listen</i> to me, <i>now, Ernie.</i>

710
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,509
Walk away.

711
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,671
It's too late. We're at the gym now
unloading the van.

712
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,080
You took my van?

713
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,797
Wait there. I'll be back in ten minutes.

714
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,314

leaving you kids alone unsupervised?

767
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,750
I've gotta say, I was impressed.

768
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,832
The way they fought?
They're on point, guvnor.

769
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,511
Whoever trained them
knows what he's doing.

770
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,874
Thank you. That's enough.

771
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,150
- Well, I'm just saying.
- Well, quit saying.

772
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,719
Okay, thank you.

773
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,552
No sooner do I entertain
Matthew's offer to buy me out

774
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,677
and reject Dry Eye's offer

775
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,913
does one of my farms get raided.

776
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,035
First time ever.

777
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,077
Doesn't feel like a coincidence, does it?

778
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,231
It isn't. There's fuckery afoot.

779
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,629
- How did they find it?
- I don't know.

780
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,835
I'm making inquiries.

781
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,872
What about Matthew?

782
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,429
He's gonna need reassuring
before he parts with 400 big ones.

783
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,117
So many questions unanswered, Ray.

784
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,949
I mean, who'd be smart enough
to find one of Mickey's farms?

785
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,030
Apart from me, of course.

786
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,034
<i>And who would be bold enough
to make such a move?</i>

787
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,999
<i>Especially to film it all
and then post it all online?</i>

788
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,596
Because that is really
rubbing your face in it, isn't it?

789
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,634
<i>I'm here to help, Michael.</i>

790
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:58,396
I'm your friend, your ally,
your Santa Claus for all seasons,

791
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,155
and I'd like you to know my team of elves
can be very persuasive.

792
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,350
Persuasive?
And why would I need persuasive?

793
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,796
Well, I hear you might have had
a little trouble.

794
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,876
Now, you helped me before
when my source ran dry,

795
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,474
so I'm just returning the favor
and reminding you

796
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,073
I have effectual friends.

797
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,480
Elves?

798
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,390
Elves?

799
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,233
- Yes. You said elves.
- Did I?

800
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,390
Mm.

801
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,636
No trouble over here, Matthew.
No trouble at all.

802
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,760
So we brought you a token.

803
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,075
You did?

804
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,509
And what might this be?

805
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:43,070
It's a paperweight to keep down
all the paper I'm about to give you.

806
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:46,118
- Well, it looks like a gun.
- And it's a paperweight.

807
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,477
Seeing how in this country,
unlike in our homeland,

808
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:50,550
they're illegal.

809
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,439
So is riding your bicycle at night
without lights.

810
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,033
Laws are there as a guideline.

811
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,873
In France,
it's illegal to call a pig Napoleon,

812
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,234
but just try and stop me.

813
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,470
I quite like it. You're very kind.

814
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,154
- Thank you.
- Hands across the sea.

815
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,311
<i>Mickey calmed down the Jew</i>

816
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,993
<i>and it seems the deal
is still going ahead.</i>

817
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,471
<i>But bad timing, jeopardizing deals,</i>

818
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,198
<i>shutting down farms.</i>

819
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:18,274
<i>It could be an expensive disaster
if Mickey doesn't get this cleaned up.</i>

820
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,478
Should I be scared?

821
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:25,310
I don't think so,
but I like to err on the side of caution.

822
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,993
What does that mean?

823
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,957
It means I'm going to have to close shop,

824
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,078
shut this farm down and make it disappear.

825
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,790
You might see a couple of trucks
around here over the next few days,

826
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,915
but that's it.

827
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,959
Well, I'm not gonna pretend
that missing out

828
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,998
on a million pounds commission a year
isn't going to hurt somewhat.

829
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,113
The pain is being shared.

830
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:46,676
Stolen product, loss of earnings meantime,

831
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,718
the cost of shutting down,
the expense of setting up elsewhere.

832
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,676
It's funny, really,
but it couldn't be worse timing.

833
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,114
How so?

834
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,395
I've...

835
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,876
I've just learned we need
a whole new roof apparently.

836
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,316
As I say,
I'm as upset about this as you are.

837
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,997
- Henry.
- Mickey.

838
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:13,594
<i>The toffs look after Mickey.
Now Mickey looks after the toffs.</i>

839
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,760
<i>But there's a lot of toffs to look after.</i>

840
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,677
- Henry.
- And <i>When</i> it <i>rains...</i>

841
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,114
Let me take care of the roof.

842
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,476
. <i>”if fucking pours.</i>

843
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,032
<i>Now, there's only one thing that needs
more looking after than a toff,</i>

844
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:29,720
<i>and that is a toff's offspring.</i>

845
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,156
<i>Which brings me neatly back
to Big Dave's story,</i>

846
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,198
<i>the very reason I'm sitting here
sipping Whiskey with you</i>

847
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,634
<i>in the first fucking place.</i>

848
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:41,315
<i>This is how Big Dave
is gonna bring Mickey down,</i>

849
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,598
<i>by using and abusing
Lord Pressfield's much-beloved child.</i>

850
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,838
Lord Pressfield's daughter,
the famous and talented Laura,

851
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,558
all self-hate and harm,

852
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,871
has fallen for this Power Noel's
smacked-out dark charm,

853
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,678
and I want the lot of them,

854
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,119
especially that
slimy little jam rag Pearson,

855
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,714
in bed with a skint, discredited toff,

856
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,634
and supplying gear
to young and reckless rock-star royals,

857
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,996
royals unbridled by distracted parents

858
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,151
too busy skiing
on the Swiss Alps to notice

859
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,992
and too fucking stupid to care.

860
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,839
I like it.
You're good at this, boss.

861
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,877
Yeah, I know what I'm good at, Hammy.
Fuck off.

862
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:22,636
<i>Aristocratic, junkie, bulimic,
auto-tuned singing daughter</i>

863
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,314
<i>shacked up with some smacked-out,
once-upon-a-time pop star,</i>

864
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,038
<i>and all looked after by Mickey Pearson.</i>

865
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:30,158
I like it. You know, I like it a lot.

866
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,638
We wrapped her in cotton wool.

867
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,597
But she was our little Lor-la.

868
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,919
Charlie called her that
because she couldn't say Laura at first.

869
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,393
We miss her terribly, Mickey.

870
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,079
I've failed as a parent.

871
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,310
You mustn't keep
beating yourself up, dear.

872
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,392
Anne's right, Charles.
You mustn't blame yourselves.

873
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:51,391
It sounds as though Laura fell in
with the wrong crowd

874
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,869
at a time when she was
particularly vulnerable.

875
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,553
What more could we do?

876
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,593
It's happened to so many of our friends.

877
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,114
It's a curse.

878
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,995
- Do you mind if I look into it?
- So you'll help us?

879
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,159
Let me see what I can do.

880
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,717
You should get yourself
one of these, boss.

881
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,438
Well, that's the plan.

882
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,994
Everything all right?

883
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,880
You remember their daughter?

884
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,997
Yeah, Laura. Nice girl. Good voice.

885
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:24,675
Teeny sort of spunk-funk fuck pop.
Shame about the habit.

886
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,909
She's gone missing.

887
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,991
They've asked us to find her,
bring her home.

888
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,470
Mm-hmm.

889
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,715
Is that a problem?

890
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,552
Well, I had a feeling
you might ask me this, boss,

891
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,278
so I did some due diligence.

892
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,112
I know where she is and I don't like it.

893
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,350
- I'd rather we didn't get involved.
- Why not?

894
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,031
<i>She's on a South London council estate.</i>

895
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,350
- 80?
- It's out of our jurisdiction.

896
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,876
There's too many moving parts,
parts that we can't control.

897
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,758
What if she doesn't wanna come?
It's gonna get messy.

898
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,480
Well, that may be true,
but you're still doing it.

899
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,000
I accept that.

900
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:58,391
- But can't you send Frazier instead?
- No, I can't send Frazier instead.

901
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,794
You're my best man. I want you.

902
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,919
It's just that I don't like smackies.

903
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,116
It's the filth and the grime
and the grub in the tub.

904
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,073
I'm not asking your OCD
to spend the weekend with them, Ray.

905
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,358
Think of it as philanthropy.

906
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,194
Come on, you're driving.

907
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,472
No good deed goes unpunished.

908
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:26,838
And this is where you have
your moment, isn't it, Raymondo?

909
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,399
This is where you step on stage

910
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,915
and set the dominoes flying
every-fucking-where.

911
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,515
Meaning what?

912
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:37,355
Meaning no good deed goes unpunished.

913
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,794
Knock, knock-knock, knock, knock.

914
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,349
<i>Buenos Dias.</i>

915
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,349
Wrong door.

916
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,555
Ah, ah, ah.

917
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,276
My name is Raymond Smith.

918
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,071
Can I step inside for a moment, please?

919
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,033
How can I help you, Officer?

920
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,471
I'm not the police.
No, I just need a moment of your time.

921
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,437
It's about Laura Pressfield.

922
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,394
I don't know anyone of that name.

923
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,669
It would be much easier
for all parties concerned

924
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,751
if I could just step inside for a moment.

925
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:24,835
No, fuck off.

926
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,797
Jeez.

927
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:28,755
That's a nice whip, bruv.

928
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,514
Killer motor.
It's a shame about them rims, though.

929
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,954
Yeah, lend us the keys.

930
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,553
Put some chrome twenty-twos on that.

931
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,519
Hey, my man's got the Dessies
and the bootcuts, you know.

932
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,193
Deffo linking a Jessie.

933
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,434
What the fuck?

934
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,309
- What are you doing here?
- Now, now, now.

935
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,720
- Get the fuck out.
- Now, now, now.

936
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,231
As you was, boys and girls.

937
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,600
Sit down.

938
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:32,795
Thank you.

939
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,557
Shall we have a little bit of fresh air?

940
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,751
Who the fuck are your mates, Brown?

941
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:50,834
No need to get excited, young man.
We will be gone in a few moments.

942
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,480
No, no, no, you'll be gone before then.
Get the fuck out now.

943
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,910
I can be dangerous if I want to be.
Get the fuck out now.

944
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,709
Sit down, Power,
before you get yourself into more trouble.

945
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,269
How do you know my name?
How the fuck does he know my name?

946
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,033
I know all your names.

947
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,917
Apart from that little anomaly.

948
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,757
I know where you went to school.

949
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,757
I know who your parents are.

950
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:21,311
And I know you'll suck a cock
for a five-pound bag.

951
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,192
Now sit.

952
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,832
Just so we're clear, I work for a man,

953
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,039
a powerful man.

954
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,470
Michael Pearson.

955
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,198
Ten points to you, Laura.

956
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,554
Who's Michael Pearson?

957
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:49,270
Friend of her father's.
Runs London's puff game.

958
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,555
A big dick swinger.

959
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,389
What is your name, young man?

960
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,790
- Aslan.
- And where are you from, Aslan?

961
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,837
You don't sound like one of the natives.

962
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,629
Disneyland.

963
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,273
Sounds about right.

964
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,877
Well, you are correct.
He is a big dick swinger.

965
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,997
But I wouldn't want him
to hear you say that.

966
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:09,914
It's best you forget what he apparently
does for a living after we depart.

967
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:14,071
Now, Laura, your father's asked us
to bring you home.

968
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,071
She's not going anywhere.

969
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,149
Do you mind if I sit?

970
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,435
Yes.

971
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:42,674
I don't build a joint like
the Americans and the new school...

972
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:47,235
back-strapping, jockstrapping,
coke-wrapping, and all that bollocks.

973
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,713
I like a good old-fashioned 50-50 mix, me.

974
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,679
That's how we used to play.

975
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,112
If there's one thing
I will never understand,

976
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,271
it's why you lot get addicted to heroin.

977
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:01,674
If there's one drug you should not chase,
it is the dirty dragon.

978
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,273
Did you ever give it a spin, Bunny?

979
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,159
No, not me, Ray.
I don't even puff anymore.

980
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:11,313
Of course not. Bunny likes the gym.
You can probably see that.

981
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,073
- What are you benching these days?
- Three wheels a side.

982
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,155
What about you, Brown?

983
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,798
- What about me?
- What could I lift?

984
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:24,234
You couldn't lift a wheel of cheese,
you cunt.

985
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:28,955
Now...

986
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,758
if you wanna be naughty,

987
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,992
what happened to a little smoke
and a poke and a glass of wine,

988
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,390
some Barry White, candles around the bath

989
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,879
and put your finger in the missus?

990
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,114
Who's Barry White?

991
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,279
Big black geezer.

992
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,680
Sexy voice.

993
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,478
I'm... I'm lost.

994
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,713
Am I in the bath with Barry White's finger
in my missus?

995
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:55,953
Be quiet, Brown. You were lost
long before Barry White walked in.

996
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,791
If you lot are unhappy,

997
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,474
you should share your thoughts
with your friends.

998
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:16,317
Nice friends.
Talk it out, find a positive solution.

999
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:21,033
But, no, all you lot choose squalor.

1000
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,435
Drowning in your liberal white guilt.

1001
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,278
Sorry, what am I guilty of?

1002
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,476
Being a cunt, Brown.

1003
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,353
Being a cunt.

1004
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,478
Anyway, I'm not your shrink.

1005
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,234
I'm just trying to radiate
some positive vibes man to man.

1006
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,709
I mean, that's what this puff game
used to be all about.

1007
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,640
Anyway...

1008
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,075
back to you, Laura,

1009
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,391
queen in this here kingdom of shit.

1010
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,755
A single rose in a cauldron of thorns.

1011
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,153
Are you ready to turn the corner?

1012
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,311
Open the curtains and let the light in?

1013
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,759
Do your mum and dad a favor
and try the impossible,

1014
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,073
make yourself happy.

1015
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,430
All right.

1016
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,430
Fucking hell. That was easy.

1017
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,158
All right, fantastic.

1018
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:26,199
Well, in that case, Bunny, will you
help Laura with her things, please?

1019
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,034
Incoming.

1020
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,997
It's all right, Bunny.
I don't really have anything.

1021
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,238
It's a shithole anyway.

1022
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:42,875
Don't go. Please, wait!

1023
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,029
Sit down!

1024
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:52,152
Touch me again,
I'll cut your fucking arm off.

1025
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,437
It's all right, Bunny. Keep going.

1026
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:02,076
I just will not be manhandled
by a junkie cunt.

1027
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:11,076
Dave, keep the kids in school
for one minute.

1028
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,191
My man probably wants to buy weed.

1029
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,238
- What, da Loud Pack, boss?
- Or the Purple Haze then.

1030
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,470
My man just pulled out
a donkey choker, bruv.

1031
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:24,153
Keep your puff.

1032
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,629
Buy yourself a sticky book
and a packet of sweets.

1033
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,710
All-in!

1034
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,349
Now, now, now.

1035
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,959
You cunt.

1036
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,278
Fuck you!

1037
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:41,193
Hey, that is a naughty kettle, bruv.

1038
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,509
Hey, what's the time, Mr. Wolf?

1039
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:46,594
It's time for you to fuck off, lads.

1040
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:49,274
Fucking hit him, Brown!

1041
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:55,080
Ah. He's bought you a gun.

1042
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,231
That's a nice little gift.

1043
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,630
Five years in prison
all in one little box.

1044
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:02,633
Oh, but that's not a gun, dear.
That's a paperweight.

1045
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:06,839
Course it is, along with a family
of six baby bullets.

1046
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,553
Guess we'll have to get rid of that.

1047
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,591
- Hello, Ray.
- Rosalind.

1048
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,354
Sorry for the interruption.

1049
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:15,794
What do you need, Ray?

1050
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,520
Laura Pressfield
has been returned home safely.

1051
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,390
Good.

1052
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,070
What else?

1053
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,151
One of her associates had an accident.

1054
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:37,080
- Shit.
- He fell out of a window, boss.

1055
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,514
What's the time, Mr. Wolf?

1056
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:42,076
It's time for you to fuck off, lads.

1057
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:45,550
Oh, shit.

1058
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,278
Sounds like quite an extreme accident.

1059
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,630
Yeah, it was more like a death, really.

1060
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,316
- Oh, shit.
- Selfie, bruv!

1061
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,515
So you killed someone?

1062
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,151
No. It was the gravity that killed him.

1063
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,799
- Who was he?
- Aslan.

1064
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,190
Some Russian kid with tracks on his arms.

1065
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:03,270
Russian kid?

1066
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:05,317
- That doesn't sound good.
- Anyone see you?

1067
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,232
Little selfie? Selfie, bruv?

1068
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,310
Shit.

1069
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,757
Nothing was recorded. We left it clean.

1070
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,349
- The body?
- I've dealt with that.

1071
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,680
- This is not ideal.
- It is not.

1072
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,834
<i>You can't be fooled
by how those junk/es dress.</i>

1073
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,596
<i>They went to schools, expensive schools.</i>

1074
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,670
Aslan.

1075
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:27,149
<i>Their parents have money,
lots of money.</i>

1076
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,357
And money can be a problem.

1077
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,429
Shit.

1078
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,239
I bet you told Mickey nothing
about what happened.

1079
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,991
You're fishing, Fletcher,
because you've got no idea.

1080
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:43,033
You're right, I am fishing.

1081
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:47,159
Look at this.
I'm fishing in my little baggie.

1082
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,639
And what have I found?

1083
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,390
Oh.

1084
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,790
Thank you. Or should I say...

1085
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:56,710
<i>spasibo?</i>

1086
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,560
What's that young man doing?

1087
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,478
Is he looking for something on the floor?

1088
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,399
Frazier.

1089
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,554
Lads, we're gonna need those phones.

1090
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,032
Hey, run. Move, bruv. Move.

1091
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,396
Bunny, get him. Fucking clean that up.

1092
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,474

- Little cunt.

What you saying now, fam? Huh?
Now I've got backup.

1098
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,916
You couldn't back up a phone, you cunt.

1099
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,279
Bruv, this guy's trying to take my phone.

1100
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,550
- What? Fucking do him.
- Back the fuck up!

1101
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:57,199
How you gonna talk your way
out of this one, mate?

1102
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,719
Easy, lads.

1103
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:03,755
I'm sure you're all roadmen, gangsters,

1104
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,559
proper naughty boys and all that bollocks.

1105
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,670
But I come in peace.

1106
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:15,318
I'm not trying to steal it.
I'm trying to buy it.

1107
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:19,479
For good money. Honest money.

1108
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,358
Yeah? What, this phone?

1109
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,679
- How much?
- A full bag.

1110
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:32,275
Then I'll be gone,
like the darkness at dawn.

1111
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:36,073
How about you give us that bag
and be gone anyway?

1112
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,958
Stop fucking around, cunt.

1113
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:51,320
Give me the phone and take the money.

1114
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,116
Drop the fucking money and run, boy.

1115
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:02,710
Right.

1116
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:07,513
- Fuck!
- Move, move, move!

1117
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:10,350
Now...

1118
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:16,357
put the phone on the ground.

1119
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:26,834

Fletcher, shoes off inside.

1127
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,557
Leave them by the door.

1128
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,153
Yes, Mommy.

1129
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,071
Come on, bruv. Where's your pace, brother?

1130
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:05,198
You can do better than that.

1131
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,429

Nearly there. Nearly there.

Lift those legs up.
Come on, bro.

1136
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:19,432
You should have brought
your running shoes today, bro.

1137
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:20,715
Trying out for the Olympics, are we?

1138
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,798
It's fucking Usain Bolt. Come on, Usain.

1139
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:37,310
Phone.

1140
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:47,914
Sorry about that.

1141
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:51,954
Can I go home now?

1142
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:54,833
Course you can, darling.
Course you can.

1143
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:16,995
Is there a problem here, Ray?

1144
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,434
I don't know.

1145
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:21,073
Is there a problem here, Fletcher?

1146
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,031
I see no problem at all.

1147
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:27,552
I forgot to wash my hands.

1148
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,679
Next time call first.

1149
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,159
Sorry, guv.

1150
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,190
And you haven't heard a whisper?

1151
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,476
How can so much bush go missing
and nobody know nothing?

1152
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:40,074
<i>Ah, I've heard nothing, Coach, honestly.</i>

1153
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:41,355
<i>Nothing on the street.</i>

1154
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,034
<i>But you know what? There is this geezer
called Mickey Pearson.</i>

1155
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,236
- Who the fuck is Mickey Pearson?
<i>- Ah, you know him.</i>

1156
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,470
<i>He runs the bush game.
He is a horrible cunt.</i>

1157
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,119
<i>You don't wanna step on his toes.</i>

1158
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,669
<i>But there's no way your lads
jimmied their way into his car,</i>

1159
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,433
<i>so I wouldn't concern yourself with that.</i>

1160
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:56,238
All right, you know
where to find me, Chasa.

1161
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:57,640
Keep your ear to the ground.

1162
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,313
Primetime, in you get.

1163
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,189
Ernie.

1164
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,038
Did you get that Chinese fella's name?

1165
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:06,315
- Phuc.
- What?

1166
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,913
Phuc, like "fuck" With a "Ph."

1167
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,389
Don't get street with me, Ernie.
Where does he live?

1168
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,676
- Posh part of Croydon.
- Drop the rope.

1169
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,353
There is no posh part of Croydon.

1170
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:18,634
- It's comparative, innit?
- Oi, Ernie, what are you doing?

1171
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,199
Why aren't you training, you black cunt?

1172
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:21,989
I'm on my own here.

1173
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,599
Did he just call me a black cunt?

1174
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:26,909
Yes, he did.

1175
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:28,594
He can't do that. That's racist.

1176
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:30,432
But, you are black
and you are a cunt, Ernie.

1177
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:31,510
Those are the facts.

1178
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,432
I don't think Primetime cares
what race you run in.

1179
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:36,680
The fact that I'm black has nothing to do
with the fact I'm a cunt.

1180
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:38,558
He didn't say black people
were cunts, Ernie.

1181
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,075
He was being specific to you.
One has nothing to do with the other.

1182
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:42,798
And I'd go a step further,
if I'm not mistaken,

1183
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,632
and say it was a term
of familiar affection.

1184
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:47,759
Primetime's a Gypsy.
I wouldn't call him a pikey cunt.

1185
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:49,751
Why not? He might be very understanding.

1186
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,478
Only if it comes from a place of love,
of course.

1187
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:53,233
Now, back to the issue at hand.

1188
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:55,470
I need that Chinese geezer's address,
okay?

1189
01:04:55,560 --> 01:04:57,198
You'll have it by the morning, Coach.

1190
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:59,157
- Good lad.
- And, Coach...

1191
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:00,639
- What?
- I've got some good news.

1192
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,234
- What?
- I found out whose weed we took.

1193
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:07,071
And now you fucking tell me!

1194
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:09,394
Did I say stop?

1195
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:13,679
Ernie, this is not the fucking time

1196
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,831
to keep your cards close to your chest.

1197
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,070
Just tell me his name
isn't Mickey Pearson.

1198
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,071
Blimey, Coach, are you a Gypsy too?

1199
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,591
You been reading tea leaves,
got a crystal ball?

1200
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:24,909
That is not good news, Ernie.

1201
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:28,592
Mickey Pearson is terrible news in
the face of a violent and expensive debt.

1202
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,434
I'm here to see your boss.

1203
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:47,994
Feel free to talk.

1204
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,631
I gather you're the consigliere
of the outfit

1205
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:53,360
that my boys were stupid enough
to fuck around with.

1206
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:58,235
On that note, I'd like to extend
my apologies on their behalf.

1207
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,633
My boys, they're naive,

1208
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,111
they've had hard lives
and they're just starting to come good,

1209
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:06,238
but they're my lads, my responsibility,

1210
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,876
so it's me that should be accountable
for their actions.

1211
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:13,075
Now, I can return your goods,
but I can't return the inconvenience,

1212
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:15,231
the time, the fucking headache.

1213
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:21,240
And so I offer you my loyalty,
my word, my time,

1214
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,512
until that debt is settled.

1215
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:30,193
I'll make amends,
but just leave me lads alone.

1216
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:35,631
First of all, I'm gonna need to know
how your lads got the information

1217
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,717
about where our farm was sited,

1218
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:39,872
'cause that's not common knowledge.

1219
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:45,233
Once we've overcome that little challenge,
then we can talk.

1220
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,636
Well, I can do better than that.

1221
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:58,110
His name is Phuc,

1222
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,470
but it's spelled with a "Ph,"
so it sounds like "fu-uck."

1223
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:04,238
So it's Phu-uc?

1224
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,277
What? Yeah, something like that.

1225
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,795
Anyway, he's the kid that gave us
the skunk farm job.

1226
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,395
Do you know him?

1227
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,438
Yeah, we've met before,
haven't we, Phu-uc... Phuc?

1228
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:14,635
- That's the one.
- Phu-uc?

1229
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,711
- Phuc.
- Phuc.

1230
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,310
All right.

1231
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:21,518
Don't do anything stupid, now, son, right?

1232
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:26,198
How did you know the location?

1233
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,839
I need my inhaler.

1234
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,240
Yeah, in a minute.

1235
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:33,071
I need you to tell me how you knew
the location of our farm.

1236
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:37,711
I've been trailing you for months.
Dry Eye was given the address.

1237
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:41,234
I can't breathe! I need it, please.

1238
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:44,233
All right, Phuc. Calm the fu-uck down.

1239
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:49,320
Right, here, steady yourself.
For fuck's sake.

1240
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:52,674
Sort him out.

1241
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,112
All right.

1242
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:57,794
Here, here, look at me.

1243
01:07:58,760 --> 01:07:59,750
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1244
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:01,433
- Where's your inhaler?
- There.

1245
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:05,270
Right, here, take a blim.

1246
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:08,990
Now, good boy.
There you go, son. You all right?

1247
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:12,950
Fuck!

1248
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:15,514
No, stop, don't!

1249
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:25,918
Fuck's sake, Ray.
You need to invest in some parachutes.

1250
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,152
There's a pattern emerging here.

1251
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:29,560
I'm sorry, boss.

1252
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,916
And who's this jumping Phuc boy, anyway?

1253
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,594
- It's Dry Eye's man.
- You mean Lord George's man.

1254
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:38,590
It could just be Dry Eye's doing.
He's been getting bold lately.

1255
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:39,909
Yeah.

1256
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,991
Well, they still all work for Lord George.

1257
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,952
I'm gonna take care of this one myself.

1258
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,115
Lord George.

1259
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,034
Mr. Pearson.

1260
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,999
And to what do I owe?

1261
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:31,915
What you watching?

1262
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:34,759
I'm watching the telly.

1263
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:37,078
What you watching on the telly?

1264
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:39,674
I'm watching the horse racing.

1265
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:43,556
Live satellite from Hong Kong.

1266
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,198
My only vice.

1267
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:48,590
Well, that's not strictly true, is it?

1268
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:50,674
Meaning?

1269
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:54,469
Meaning I've always taken vice
to be the definition

1270
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,552
of any criminal activity
or wicked behavior

1271
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:00,473
involving prostitution,
pornography or drugs,

1272
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,790
SO, no...

1273
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:07,231
racing is definitely
not your only vice, your lordship.

1274
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:10,312
I'd say you're eyebrows deep
in every vice known to man.

1275
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,516
- There is a difference.
- Being?

1276
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:19,469
I facilitate. I don't participate
in any of the aforementioned vices.

1277
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:23,110
What about tea?

1278
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,354
What about tea?

1279
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,512
Well, that too is a vice.

1280
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:41,471
Caffeine is a drug, don't you know?

1281
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:45,440
So is that what you're here
to talk to me about? Tea?

1282
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:49,275
Sweet Mary Jane is my vice of choice,
as you well know.

1283
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:52,991
Of course, I'm addicted to selling it,
not consuming it.

1284
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:56,631
I specifically chose to deal in marijuana.

1285
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:58,832
Sure, I could see
there was more to be made

1286
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:02,754
in shifting the white or the brown powder,
as you so chose,

1287
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:07,357
but, you see, my jam,
it doesn't kill anyone,

1288
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,473
and I like that.

1289
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:13,518
<i>While your poison...</i>

1290
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:19,351
is and always has been
a destroyer of worlds.

1291
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:32,634
So, yes, your facilitation
is most definitely participation.

1292
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,832
But I'm not here to give you
a sermon on situational ethics.

1293
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:49,313
So why the fuck are you here?

1294
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,471
You're starting a war with me, George,

1295
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,392
and I'm trying to moonwalk
with elegance here,

1296
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,437
but I'm finding it very fucking difficult.

1297
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:13,870
Laura!

1298
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:15,917
<i>I don't fuck around with puff.</i>

1299
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,071
You send your man Dry Eye around my place

1300
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:20,037
to see if he can buy my business
for a few beans.

1301
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:21,155
Laura!

1302
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,351
<i>You did/7</i> 7 <i>think I'd find out?</i>

1303
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,272
Having me followed for months?

1304
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,870
Yeah. You crossed the line,

1305
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,519
<i>and that comes with a price.</i>

1306
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,037
You raided one of my locations.

1307
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,598
<i>You know the rules, George.</i>

1308
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,913
What the fuck were you thinking?

1309
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:43,795
You raided one of my locations.
What the fuck were you thinking?

1310
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:46,231
What the fuck were you thinking, George?

1311
01:13:22,520 --> 01:13:25,592
Should you try and undermine me,

1312
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:29,159
or should you attempt
to threaten my position again,

1313
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:31,914
I will be forced to accept
your call to arms.

1314
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,229
Do you understand?

1315
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:36,715
Good.

1316
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,789
Now, I can see you're feeling
somewhat under the weather.

1317
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:43,953
<i>Thefts because I spiked your fee</i>

1318
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:46,270
<i>with a nasty little parasitic genus
called shigella</i>

1319
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:51,196
Left unattended, you will shit yourself
to death before the sun doth set.

1320
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,957
I suggest taking
two of these fizzy biscuits.

1321
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:59,153
You'll be fine in an hour or two,

1322
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:02,036
long enough to consider
your past indiscretions.

1323
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,630
And, George, if I can get to you
in your own kitchen...

1324
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:15,152
I can get to you anywhere.

1325
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:25,314
- Did you do it?
- Do what?

1326
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,960
Did you raid Mickey Pearson's farm?

1327
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:29,394
No.

1328
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:32,074
So you're telling me
that Phuc did this behind your back.

1329
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,753
Well, let's just say this.
He didn't do it in front of it.

1330
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:37,669
He did it without my blessing.

1331
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:41,230
But you did go behind my back
and offer to buy his business.

1332
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,874
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

1333
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:50,556
Now, let me warn you
the way you warn me.

1334
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:55,354
There comes a point
where the young succeed the old.

1335
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:57,595
Don't push me.

1336
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,833
There are some things
I don't know about.

1337
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:07,072
Something between Dry Eye
and Lord George.

1338
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:11,916
Now, whatever it was,
someone killed Lord George.

1339
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:17,357
Anyone else might think
that was you or Mickey.

1340
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,911
Shall we continue with our little story?

1341
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,711
Does that arouse your interest, Raymond?

1342
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:27,794
80 Matthew knows Dry Eye.

1343
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:31,237
- So what?
- Well, yes, I agree.

1344
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:32,549
Perhaps they were just meeting up

1345
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,472
to talk about holidaying
in the Maldives

1346
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:38,474
or the long-term implications
of leaving the EU.

1347
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:43,475
But I filmed it, had it lip-read,
translated and transcribed.

1348
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:46,592
Rather like the classic 1974 film
The <i>Conversation,</i>

1349
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:49,069
starring Gene Hackman
and John Cazale.

1350
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:52,471
You know, Coppola slipped that one out
between the Godfathers.

1351
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,429
It wasn't really for me.
It's a bit boring, to be honest.

1352
01:15:55,520 --> 01:16:00,549
Now, can I just say, that Matthew,
he's quite something, isn't he?

1353
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,677
He's not your average American.

1354
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:06,116
He's a Mr. International.
Even speaks a bit of Cantonese.

1355
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:11,513
Come here. You play Dry Eye
and I shall be Matthew.

1356
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:14,309
Come on.

1357
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:21,793
All right.

1358
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:24,837
Try and get it in time
with his lips, all right?

1359
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:26,399
- Yeah, yeah.
- Ready?

1360
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:28,789
Roll camera. Action.

1361
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:44,515
<i>There was an incident.
Lord George...</i>

1362
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:45,749
<i>Fuck's sake, Raymond.</i>

1363
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,160
It's a bit fucking wooden.

1364
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:49,390
Put something into it, you know,
a bit of welly.

1365
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:51,394
And action.

1366
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:55,075
There was an incident.
Lord George didn't come through it.

1367
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:56,116
Didn't come through it?

1368
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,919
The last thing you need to do
is attract any octopus.

1369
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,149
Octopus?

1370
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:04,353
What does that mean?
It's not a very good translation.

1371
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:05,953
No, there's nothing wrong
with the translation.

1372
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:07,872
Matthew's not that fluent.
And it's Cantonese.

1373
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:09,553
Just go with it
and fill in the blanks.

1374
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:10,914
And action.

1375
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:13,671
<i>life all on Michael.
He is to blame.</i>

1376
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:15,874
<i>That is not a smart move.</i>

1377
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,951
Don't tell me what a smart move is.

1378
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:19,269
<i>I beg for your pardon.</i>

1379
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,839
You heard me perfectly well.

1380
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:23,753
<i>There will be repercussions
for Michael's actions.</i>

1381
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:25,433
You think you're running things,
do you?

1382
01:17:25,960 --> 01:17:27,837
<i>Don't stroke my mouse hair.</i>

1383
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:29,955
What does "mouse hair" mean?

1384
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:32,310
Yeah, I think what he means
is don't jeopardize my deal,

1385
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,277
but I admit that one's a bit of a googly.

1386
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:35,998
Then Matthew loses it a bit

1387
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:38,515
and his translation goes
completely out of the window.

1388
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:41,479
Something about springtime
and sweaters.

1389
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:43,119
I think what he means is he's upset.

1390
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:46,238
<i>And then Dry Eye says something,
but some cunt moved in front of me,</i>

1391
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:47,719
<i>so I did/77 get that eff/76”:</i>

1392
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:50,952
Your Cantonese is dog shit,
so I'm gonna say this in English

1393
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:54,032
and I'm gonna say it once,
so listen to me, Rubenstein.

1394
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,358
This is how it's gonna play out.

1395
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,398
You're gonna back the fuck off...

1396
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:04,038
and I'm gonna take it all.

1397
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:08,119
And you will pay me my respect.

1398
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:11,516
And there you have it.
That's all I've got.

1399
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,479
Sorry. Show's over.

1400
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:17,279
But I think it's quite clear

1401
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:19,749
that they're not just
mah-jongg partners, are they?

1402
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:21,395
Mm?

1403
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,276
Not all of that was clear, Fletcher.

1404
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,237
I mean, according to you,

1405
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:35,630
we already know
Matthew wants to buy Michael out.

1406
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:40,190
- So why is that news?
- Oh, don't you worry, my darling.

1407
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:42,078
We are gonna come to the news.

1408
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,474
<i>I'm approaching my climax.</i>

1409
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:53,514
Dry Eye.

1410
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:57,311
I trust you will make Michael Pearson
pay for this.

1411
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:00,237
You are the dragon head now.

1412
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,072
Solidify your position.

1413
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:04,880
It will be done, Uncle.

1414
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,913
<i>80 0/3/ Eye got the upgrade
he was after, didn't he, Raymond?</i>

1415
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,435
<i>The question is,
what was he gonna do with it</i>

1416
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,636
<i>now that he's Billy Big Bollocks?</i>

1417
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:15,279
Give me ten minutes, Ray.

1418
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:17,470
Boss.

1419
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:32,754
Hello, Ros.

1420
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:37,789
It's date night tonight, 9:00 p.m.,
you and I, River Cafe.

1421
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:40,156
Nine o'clock? I'll be there.

1422
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:45,598
We're closed.

1423
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:46,795
Hang up.

1424
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:49,675
No.

1425
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,474
<i>Hang the fucking phone up.</i>

1426
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:52,595
Who's there?

1427
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:55,993
Ros, who's there?

1428
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,595
<i>What you doing here, Dry Eye?</i>

1429
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:03,437
It's warming up now, isn't it?

1430
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:07,275
At this point, I'm guessing
that you didn't even know

1431
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:09,431
that Lord George was dead yet,

1432
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,909
let alone what Dry Eye was up to.

1433
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,435
Hello, Dry Eye. What do you want?

1434
01:20:26,920 --> 01:20:27,990
Fancy a boiled sweet?

1435
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:31,154
- No.
- Suit yourself.

1436
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:40,794
Who the fuck was he?

1437
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:43,156
<i>I'm not exactly sure
What happened next,</i>

1438
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:45,754
<i>because you two
managed to give me the slip.</i>

1439
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,831
They got Rosalind. Call Roger.

1440
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:51,790
Oh, goody. Another bottle.

1441
01:20:51,880 --> 01:20:54,030
Hold on. You were there?

1442
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:58,711
Yeah. Of course I was there.

1443
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:02,836
He's not picking up.
Maybe you should put your seat belt on.

1444
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:05,997
Yeah, let me call Rosalind.
Let me do it.

1445
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:09,636
I got it. Just watch the road.

1446
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,397
Now, Rosalind, don't be alarmed,

1447
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,073
but you're gonna come with me

1448
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:16,595
until I can resolve all these issues
with your husband.

1449
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:18,719
I'm not going anywhere.

1450
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:21,471
She's not picking up.
It's just ringing.

1451
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:24,279
- Fuck.
- We could just slow down a little bit.

1452
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:27,514
Fuck!

1453
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:43,874
<i>You know how it works.</i>

1454
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:48,149
You either come with me or Tony here
is gonna make you come with me.

1455
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:50,993
You're in my office under my roof.

1456
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:52,912
It's not your position
for Tony to do anything

1457
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,355
other than to fuck off back
from whence he came.

1458
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:56,999
Tony.

1459
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,715
What's that? Is that a paperweight?

1460
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,120
Funny you should say that.

1461
01:22:03,200 --> 01:22:05,316
Turns out anything with weight
can be a paperweight.

1462
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,636
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Well, that's up to you, isn't it?

1463
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:10,109
Either you do as I tell you to
and use the door,

1464
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,669
or I'm gonna shoot fat Tony
right between the eyes.

1465
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:14,797
You see,
this gun's only got two bullets,

1466
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:17,394
so I'm not gonna fuck about
illustrating its significance.

1467
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:19,278
You're gonna have to trust me on that.

1468
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:21,158
The alternative is a little bit absolute.

1469
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:24,277
I'm gonna have
to check your grammar on that.

1470
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:26,990
It can't be just a little bit absolute.

1471
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:29,594
It either is or it isn't.

1472
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:32,832
Whatever it is, I've lost my patience.

1473
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:36,834
I'm telling you, I will squeeze
this trigger and Tony will be no more.

1474
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:38,752
Tony.

1475
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:41,480
Listen to me, cunt.

1476
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:44,718
You take one step forward, it'll be
the last fucking step you ever take.

1477
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:45,756
Tony, get on it.

1478
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:22,879
I fucking dare you.

1479
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:26,670
Just calm down.

1480
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:28,790
I'm leaving.

1481
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:37,914
I guess that's your two bullets, eh?

1482
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:39,876
Rosalind!

1483
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:55,520
Rosalind!

1484
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,275
Stay fucking still!

1485
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:12,030
Hello, babe.

1486
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:29,955
Hello, love.

1487
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:32,796
<i>So you're basing your whole crescendo</i>

1488
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,078
on a figment of your imagination.

1489
01:24:35,160 --> 01:24:37,470
I'm basing my whole crescendo

1490
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:38,959
on the sum of its parts.

1491
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,316
A few minor details aside,
I wouldn't have any trouble at all

1492
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:45,394
selling this juicy peach of a drama
to Big Dave.

1493
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:47,437
He'd cream his fucking panties.

1494
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:50,234
You're too smart
to be blackmailing us, Fletcher.

1495
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:53,233
Yes, yes, and obviously
I've taken precautionary measures.

1496
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:56,711
You can do all kinds
of horrible things to me if you want.

1497
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:59,072
I might even enjoy them.

1498
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:01,834
But you'd have to leave the country
and never come back.

1499
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,911
So is that the story over now,
Fletcher?

1500
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,755
All this, this whole buildup,
was leading to this next part.

1501
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:10,639
This is the news
that you were asking about before.

1502
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:12,639
Ready?

1503
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:14,270
Matthew.

1504
01:25:15,160 --> 01:25:17,197
<i>He's gonna need some people
to run his business here</i>

1505
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:18,998
<i>when he buys it from Michael, right?</i>

1506
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:21,959
He's gonna need a reliable
pair of hands, someone like you.

1507
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:24,077
Hmm. So why didn't he ask you, Raymond?

1508
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:26,595
I don't know.
It's none of my business.

1509
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:28,159
Because, I'll tell you,

1510
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:31,275
he already had someone
earmarked for the role.

1511
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:33,440
<i>Dry Eye.</i>

1512
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,272
He promised Dry Eye the job,

1513
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:39,189
but only if Dry Eye helped drive down
the price of Mickey's business.

1514
01:25:39,320 --> 01:25:40,640
You see, it was Matthew

1515
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:43,712
<i>who told Dry Eye
the location of Mickey's farm,</i>

1516
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:46,235
<i>so he could steal
his white widow super cheese</i>

1517
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,630
to cause ripples
and reduce the market value.

1518
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:51,394
And that is why Phuc, in turn,

1519
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:55,792
<i>got those juice-swilling,
acne-backed muscle Marys to do the job.</i>

1520
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:57,831
<i>It was Matthew</i>

1521
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:00,594
who set this whole train of events off.

1522
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:03,795
<i>But what he did not plan on, you see...</i>

1523
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:05,598
Fuck you, you old cunt!

1524
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:06,949
I'll piss on your grave.

1525
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:11,239
<i>...was Dry Eye...</i>

1526
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:14,355
killing Lord George.

1527
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:19,555
Now, Dry Eye does not want to be
subservient to Matthew anymore.

1528
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:21,074
Doesn't wanna be subservient to anyone.

1529
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:22,992
This is how it's gonna play out.

1530
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,278
You're gonna back the fuck off

1531
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:28,832
and I'm gonna take it all.

1532
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:32,231
Dry Eye likes the smell of power
and does not like Matthew.

1533
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:33,640
<i>So, the little dragon</i>

1534
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:37,190
<i>needed a gentle reminder
of who was really running things.</i>

1535
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:39,271
You've been in this paddling pool
for two minutes.

1536
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:42,318
I've been swimming in the ocean
with the sharks for 20 years.

1537
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:44,994
I'll tell you how this plays out.

1538
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:47,154
You will drown...

1539
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:51,119
and then my Mossad crabs will eat you.

1540
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:56,115
And this, my love, is why I want
my hard-earned 20 million pounds.

1541
01:26:56,200 --> 01:27:02,310
Because not only do I know exactly
how Mickey's business operates,

1542
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:06,712
but I also know that the very man
he's trying to sell it to

1543
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:09,519
is trying to force him
into selling it on the cheap

1544
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:12,479
and has indirectly started a war.

1545
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:16,551
So, you see, I think you should be
calling me your trusted consigliere,

1546
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:18,840
or your spy behind the lines,

1547
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:23,158
your intellectual reconnaissance,
if you prefer.

1548
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:26,079
I'm impressed.

1549
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:29,556
You certainly know more than I do.

1550
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:32,433
I'm impressed
not only by your information,

1551
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:34,670
but by your imagination.

1552
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:36,629
Thank you very much.

1553
01:27:39,240 --> 01:27:40,992
So you've got 72 hours.

1554
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:45,357
And I would just reiterate
that if anything happens to me,

1555
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:47,716
I do have my insurance policy in place.

1556
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:51,039
Everything will go to Big Dave,
and from him to the public,

1557
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:53,151
and you, my love, will go to Mars.

1558
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:56,358
80, strong recommendation,
just pay up

1559
01:27:56,440 --> 01:28:01,958
and watch me recede into the sunset
blowing kisses, yes?

1560
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:09,238
Well, then, time to use the door,
you black bastard.

1561
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:11,709
Well, that's just silly, isn't it,
'cause I'm not black.

1562
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:14,633
No, but your fucking soul is,
you dark cunt.

1563
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:19,918
Now, out of my house,
'cause I'm going to bed.

1564
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:23,959
Can I come with you?

1565
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:29,354
No, but you can go smoke the exhaust pipe
in the back of your hearse.

1566
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,439
I might come anyway.

1567
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:36,680
You'll just hear me
scratching about in the dark,

1568
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:39,118
wanking into a hanky.

1569
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:46,874
All right, so, 20 million.

1570
01:28:48,040 --> 01:28:49,917
You've got 72 hours, starting now.

1571
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:53,474
Ticktock, ticktock.

1572
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,229
And I'm gone.

1573
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:00,833
Ticktock.

1574
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:06,632
Ticktock.

1575
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:19,711
He's just left.
He thinks he's very clever.

1576
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:21,879
Start with Big Dave.

1577
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:29,236
Now, you keep this
between you and me, Hammy,

1578
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:30,469
but Fletcher's been in touch.

1579
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:31,994
He says he's got what we need.

1580
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:34,549
Careful, boss. Fletcher's ass
belongs to the highest bidder.

1581
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:36,591
Yeah. He says he wants 150 grand.

1582
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:39,069
But if it's proper,
it's worth a whole week's exclusive.

1583
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:40,514
Well, what does he have exactly?

1584
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:43,513
He was just tickling me nuts,
but he says he wants to meet Saturday.

1585
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:44,715
So keep it free.

1586
01:29:47,080 --> 01:29:48,434
Yeah, pronto.

1587
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:58,199
Oi, you can't park there, mate.
Move the van.

1588
01:29:58,280 --> 01:30:00,430
Don't worry, friend.
We'll be gone in a minute.

1589
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,750
We're not a newspaper.
We're a blood sport.

1590
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:04,558
Oi, Russ. Move the van.

1591
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:06,153
I'm on it, boss.

1592
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,559
Move it. Now.

1593
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:12,552
- I said in a minute.
- Oi, spunk bubble.

1594
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:14,597
Get rid of the fucking van.

1595
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:23,117
I'm warning you, Russ does karate.

1596
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:30,991
Careful, boys. Russ does karate.

1597
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,915
Russ, if you know
what's good for you,

1598
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:36,911
get in the car now.

1599
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:43,478
Sorry, boss. I'm only a blue belt.

1600
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,394
You melt.

1601
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:48,955
Now what?

1602
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:51,270
We're making a YouTube movie? Eh?

1603
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,229
Break dancing?

1604
01:30:54,120 --> 01:30:55,474
I'm warning you.

1605
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:57,392
I'm fucking powerful.

1606
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:58,754
We know all that.

1607
01:30:58,840 --> 01:31:00,672
Why don't you tell us all about it
in the back of the van?

1608
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:03,832
I'm not going.
I'm not fucking... No!

1609
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,831
No.

1610
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:07,558
Get him in there.

1611
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:11,629
Unbelievable.

1612
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:17,999
Well, well, well.

1613
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,716
You're all right, Big Dave.
You're in safe hands now.

1614
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:26,599
- No need to panic, okay?
- Who are you?

1615
01:31:26,680 --> 01:31:28,478
Don't worry about that right now.

1616
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:31,239
Look...

1617
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:34,438
Look, whatever's gone on here,
I just need to get back to work.

1618
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:36,750
If you let me go,
I'll just forget all about it.

1619
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:39,753
I'll have you back to work
in short order, my friend.

1620
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,194
Now, I believe you're a reporter.

1621
01:31:42,680 --> 01:31:44,591
And there's something
I wanna report to you.

1622
01:31:44,680 --> 01:31:46,751
Now, it seems for
this brief moment in time

1623
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:48,877
I've found my way into the film business,

1624
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:53,830
and last night I made a film
with an impressively sized farmyard pig.

1625
01:31:57,880 --> 01:32:00,394
Morning, sir. Two cups of tea.

1626
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:03,040
One with sugar, one without.

1627
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:05,117
All right, lads, go on, give us a minute.

1628
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:09,591
There are some wet wipes
there over your shoulder.

1629
01:32:09,680 --> 01:32:12,513
Your clothes are neatly folded
there on the bench.

1630
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:14,238
Now, in due course,

1631
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,277
you're gonna press the space bar
on this computer

1632
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:19,910
and you're gonna witness
your participation in said film.

1633
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,356
Now, that little drug
we gave you last night really...

1634
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:26,798
loosened up your inhibitions, man.

1635
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:31,070
The only thing you'll need to do
to stop this little creative expression

1636
01:32:31,160 --> 01:32:33,674
from becoming a social media sensation

1637
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:36,593
is lose any interest you have
in the future of Mickey Pearson.

1638
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,877
I'm gonna leave you now
to clean yourself up.

1639
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:43,513
Space bar, yeah?
Have a hot drink as well.

1640
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,671
It might make you feel
a little bit better.

1641
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,478
It was a fucking rough night for you.

1642
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:50,833
Enjoy the show.

1643
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:01,558
<i>♪ Old MacDonald had a farm, e-i-e-i-o ♪</i>

1644
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:04,354
<i>♪ And on that farm he had a pig... ♪</i>

1645
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:05,635
How's your man, then, Coach?

1646
01:33:05,720 --> 01:33:06,710
Ah, he'll survive.

1647
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:08,871
Wouldn't have been the pig
I would have chosen, though.

1648
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:14,913
We know what bit that is.

1649
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:18,716
<i>Let me tickle that belly.</i>

1650
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:21,599
<i>You are so naughty.</i>

1651
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:23,990
- Good Lord.
- I was there and I'm still shocked.

1652
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:26,392
<i>Squeal for me, piggy.</i>

1653
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:29,199
- Is that who I think it is?
- Yeah, it certainly is.

1654
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:33,080
And that's your doing?

1655
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:34,912
<i>Where is that applesauce?</i>

1656
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:37,431
You can't unsee it
once you've seen it, can you?

1657
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:39,511
No, you can't unsee it.
It's nightmare fuel.

1658
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:40,795
That will be with me forever.

1659
01:33:42,200 --> 01:33:43,599
That story won't be running.

1660
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:48,913
Right. I've got one more thing
I need you to do.

1661
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,753
Ah, look, before you continue, Ray,

1662
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:54,309
I train lads to be good lads.

1663
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:55,953
I'm not a fucking gangster.

1664
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:59,670
Now, I've been forced to do
some gangster things, that's okay.

1665
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:01,478
But I'm not the gift that keeps on giving.

1666
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:04,393
So with the greatest respect,
I'll do this one last thing for you

1667
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:05,959
and then that's it.

1668
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:09,431
<i>No más</i>. Three strikes and I'm out.

1669
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:18,396
- Everything all right, Coach?
- No, Ernie, it isn't.

1670
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:21,040
You need to understand
the severity of your actions.

1671
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:29,833
Dave, an hour.

1672
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:30,910
Okay, boss.

1673
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:38,110
Thank you for the grand tour.

1674
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,793
I'm a believer.

1675
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,154
Thank you, chaps.

1676
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:45,915
Now, are we ready
to finalize the numbers?

1677
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:47,875
We already have.

1678
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:49,435
Mm...

1679
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:53,195
The situation's changed, Michael.
The market's changed.

1680
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:54,839
How so?

1681
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:58,515
The exit value of your business
needs to be recalculated.

1682
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:01,237
Please, be specific.

1683
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:02,549
Oh, I Will be.

1684
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:06,755
You're asking 400 for 12 locations
and a distribution network,

1685
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:09,354
which was a fair valuation at the time.

1686
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:12,273
But when one of those locations
was compromised,

1687
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:14,749
the value of all those locations
were compromised

1688
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:16,513
and this obviously affects the price.

1689
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:21,035
Your skunk farm was a fucking viral
sensation on YouTube, Michael.

1690
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:23,680
And when Johnny Law starts sniffing,
which he will,

1691
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:25,797
all of those locations
will have to cease production

1692
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:29,794
for, I'd say, at least 12 months
at a cost of 100 million net p.a.,

1693
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:32,633
before marking down the loss of staff,
relocation and site rentals.

1694
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:34,552
- You still with me?
- Yes, I'm following.

1695
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:36,358
It will take at least three years

1696
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:38,670
to get your supply,
distribution and demand

1697
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:40,433
back to full capacity.

1698
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:44,309
Your staffing costs are 25%
of your 100 million operational cost,

1699
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:48,030
so that's 25 million per annum
for three annums.

1700
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:50,475
And location rental at 15 million a year,

1701
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:54,679
that's a 120 GBP bite right there.

1702
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:57,354
Your unit economics have taken a hit,

1703
01:35:57,480 --> 01:36:02,031
and forecasting out your top-line growth
margin in the current inimical climate,

1704
01:36:02,120 --> 01:36:05,431
I calculate what was worth
400 million a month ago

1705
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:09,957
must now be valued
at an anemic, mm... 130.

1706
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:14,915
You see, it's not about
the first domino that fell, Michael.

1707
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:16,909
It's about the last.

1708
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:20,355
Please.

1709
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:26,639
I like you, Michael. You're a good chap.

1710
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:31,149
And if you want me to help you
out of this hole you've found yourself in,

1711
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:34,792
I can pay you 100 million dollars today.

1712
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:38,309
It's a good offer and it's real,

1713
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,630
and I'll do this because I'm your friend.

1714
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:43,792
My accountant can transfer the fee
within the hour.

1715
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:46,711
I like your domino analogy.

1716
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:52,474
The question I ask is,
who tumbled the first domino?

1717
01:36:53,160 --> 01:36:56,312
I'm afraid that's not my concern
or my business, Michael.

1718
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:57,834
At the risk of contradicting you,

1719
01:36:57,920 --> 01:37:02,278
it is very much your business,
and certainly your concern.

1720
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:05,239
Only you made one mistake.

1721
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:07,715
That being?

1722
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:11,272
You seem to have mistaken me
for some kind of a cunt.

1723
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:15,515
Let me introduce you to the first domino.

1724
01:37:19,640 --> 01:37:23,190
It's a tad dramatic, isn't it,
corpses in freezers?

1725
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:24,270
Who is this man?

1726
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:26,516
What's he got to do with anything
that I'm talking about?

1727
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:29,274
I take it with that statement
you are in denial

1728
01:37:29,360 --> 01:37:31,954
of so-said relationship
with this frozen Chinaman?

1729
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:34,270
Well, of course I'm in denial of it.

1730
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:38,069
I don't have relationships
with dead, frozen Chinamen.

1731
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:41,676
Best not to be glib at this time
in the proceedings, Matthew.

1732
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:47,716
Don't bother looking
for your Mossad crabs.

1733
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:50,229
This is a fish market.
They have found a home.

1734
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:53,269
To be clear, I do not know that man.

1735
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:57,392
<i>I'll tell you how this plays out.</i>

1736
01:37:58,040 --> 01:38:02,671
<i>You will drown and then
my Mossad crabs will eat you.</i>

1737
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:06,037
So while you were discussing
who would take over my business

1738
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:07,633
after you fucked it,

1739
01:38:08,640 --> 01:38:11,678
you somehow mistook
so-said Chinaman for someone else?

1740
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:17,473
Business is business, Michael.
It's nothing personal.

1741
01:38:17,560 --> 01:38:19,915
While I am not emotional about the money,

1742
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:23,834
there is a price indebted to me
for the blood I've gotten on my hands

1743
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:27,396
restoring order to the untidiness
that you created,

1744
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:29,153
and that price, according to you...

1745
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:33,313
400 minus 130... is 270 million dollars.

1746
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:36,438
And I'm keeping the business,

1747
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:40,872
while you are getting in the freezer.

1748
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:44,752
And you will make that transaction
if you want to get out of the freezer.

1749
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:49,437
It is 25 below zero in there,
so I assume you'll last about an hour.

1750
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:50,874
That said, I wouldn't fuck about,

1751
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:53,554
because frostbite is very expensive
on the fingers and toes,

1752
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:57,429
so I would type as quickly as possible
while you have the use of them.

1753
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:58,990
- Uh...
- After you've attended

1754
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:00,315
to that indiscretion,

1755
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:04,280
you can then deal with the next
consequence of your shortsightedness.

1756
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:08,754
As stated, I am not emotional
about the money.

1757
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:15,150
But I am emotional about the fact
that someone laid their hands on my wife.

1758
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:19,749
My wife!

1759
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:25,876
No amount of money on God's green earth
can pay for that transgression, Matthew.

1760
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:27,519
No, for that...

1761
01:39:31,400 --> 01:39:32,595
I want a pound of flesh.

1762
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:34,915
A pound of flesh?

1763
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,630
It matters not to me where
on your anatomy it is withdrawn from.

1764
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:42,831
If you don't have the stomach
to take it for yourself,

1765
01:39:42,920 --> 01:39:45,116
big Bunny here is very adept with a knife,

1766
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:47,077
and, as you can see,
he's dressed for the weather.

1767
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:51,393
But a penny short or a gram shy...

1768
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:55,315
and that freezer door does not open.

1769
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:56,390
Am I clear?

1770
01:39:57,560 --> 01:39:58,550
Good.

1771
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:01,313
- Bunny.
- Incoming.

1772
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:16,509
What, is it Wagyu again
for breakfast, Raymond?

1773
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:22,510
Aren't you gonna introduce me to your
mysterious and slightly menacing friend?

1774
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:29,991
What's that for? Is that for my money?

1775
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:33,675
Where's my money, Raymond?

1776
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:35,194
There's your payment.

1777
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:40,553
Go on, take a look.

1778
01:40:40,680 --> 01:40:42,478
Thank you, mysterious stranger.

1779
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:55,240
Well, that's disappointing, 'cause that
doesn't look like 20 million pounds.

1780
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:58,432
It's more interesting than that,
your insurance policy,

1781
01:40:58,520 --> 01:41:01,956
all the photos, all the bodies,
all the skeletons, all the filth.

1782
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:04,953
It's not the only one, darling.
I'm not a mong.

1783
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:08,670
What do you think's in that,
you fucking eejit?

1784
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:11,750
Of course we were aware
of what Matthew was up to.

1785
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:13,638
We're not complete fucking idiots.

1786
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:18,514
I've been onto you
for a long time, Fletcher.

1787
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:21,237
<i>I knew you'd been following Michael.

1788
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:23,353
<i>They're very similar, our jobs.</i>

1789
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:26,156
<i>Only I'm better at it than you are.</i>

1790
01:41:27,360 --> 01:41:31,399
I knew when you came over that night that
you'd only be there for half an hour...

1791
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:34,271
<i>Buenas tardes,</i> Raymondo.

1792
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:37,438
...to tell me how clever you are
and try to blackmail us.

1793
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:40,515
I've got some very important information
to impart to you, Raymond.

1794
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:44,150
I also knew you couldn't resist
a £1500 single malt,

1795
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:47,596
<i>an £80 Wagyu steak
and a state-of-the-art smokeless barbie</i>

1796
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:49,713
that even keeps your feet warm.

1797
01:41:49,800 --> 01:41:50,870
I love a barbie.

1798
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,913
I promise you, you will regret this
if you don't hear it.

1799
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,640
And when the Scotch
got into your cold veins,

1800
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:59,439
you lost the benefit
of your sharp instincts.

1801
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:02,196
Oh, goody. Another bottle.

1802
01:42:02,280 --> 01:42:04,112
Can you tell the mysterious gentleman
to relax?

1803
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:06,919
Because I promise you,
you will regret it if you don't hear this.

1804
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:08,035
Sit down, my love.

1805
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:11,511
See, I kept you there 'cause I needed
to know about Matthew and Dry Eye.

1806
01:42:12,720 --> 01:42:15,712
<i>Took us a while
to find your insurance policies.</i>

1807
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:19,431
<i>Cause you're a naughty squirrel,
Fletcher.</i>

1808
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,596
Fletcher, shoes off inside.

1809
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:23,909
Yes, Mommy.

1810
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:28,396
<i>But it was made a lot easier
after I planted a tracker in your shoe.</i>

1811
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:34,996
<i>You're never gonna be
a predator with us, Fletcher.</i>

1812
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:38,672
You're always gonna be prey.

1813
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:43,271
So that's it. Three strikes.
We're good, right?

1814
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:49,112
- I'll see you around.
- With the greatest respect, I hope not.

1815
01:42:55,520 --> 01:42:59,912
Now, Fletcher,
what were you saying?

1816
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:03,280
It wasn't Lord George
that was after Mickey,

1817
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:05,749
or Dry Eye, or Matthew.

1818
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:08,240
Do you wanna know who it was?

1819
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:14,075
I've got photos.

1820
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:18,711
Right. You've got 30 seconds.

1821
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:19,790
Thank you, darling.

1822
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:23,911
Fuck.

1823
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:26,995
Primetime, what is it, son?

1824
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:29,913
Coach, we're gonna take care
of this for you.

1825
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,320
Ernie's got a plan.

1826
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:33,357
What the fuck are you talking about?

1827
01:43:33,440 --> 01:43:36,796
The Michael situation.
We're gonna sort it.

1828
01:43:38,240 --> 01:43:39,833
Primetime, listen... Prime...

1829
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:42,550
Jesus.

1830
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:55,392
<i>Now, you remember As/an, don 7 you?</i>

1831
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:58,515
The young gentleman
you kept in the freezer?

1832
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:05,511
Well, this is Asian Senior,
Russian oligarch.

1833
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:09,316
<i>Ex-KGB. Made all his money in gas pipes.</i>

1834
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:12,597
And he's extremely sad that
his one-and-only son fell out of a window.

1835
01:44:13,360 --> 01:44:14,555
Oh, shit.

1836
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:18,634
And I fear that where they failed before,
Raymond, they're not gonna fail again.

1837
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:21,269
And how do you know all this?

1838
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:24,631
Because someone told them everything
they want to know about Michael,

1839
01:44:24,720 --> 01:44:27,360
and that someone is me.

1840
01:44:28,720 --> 01:44:29,755
Go on.

1841
01:44:30,600 --> 01:44:33,479
<i>So I said I'd tell them
where Michael was for a price.</i>

1842
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:38,279
But that money was pending till after,
you know, the deed was done.

1843
01:44:40,120 --> 01:44:41,793
<i>And then when they messed up
the first time,</i>

1844
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:45,470
I had a little rethink
and came up with my version 2.0 plan,

1845
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:47,471
which is when I came to see you.

1846
01:44:47,560 --> 01:44:50,359
You see, get my 20 mils off Michael first

1847
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:54,911
and then, after the event,
get paid again, double bubble.

1848
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:58,356
But you and your mysterious friend
put paid to that, so well done, you.

1849
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:00,679
Why did you just look at your watch?

1850
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:05,755
Well, it's like I say.
The Russians are gonna clean house.

1851
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:08,036
And you are part of that house, Raymond.

1852
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,958
They're gonna get Michael when he comes
out of his meeting at the fish market.

1853
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:15,600
And they are coming here.
So you see what I've done there?

1854
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:18,037
By telling you, I've saved your lives.

1855
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:20,157
Which I think in turn saves mine,
doesn't it?

1856
01:45:20,240 --> 01:45:21,958
Don't fucking move.

1857
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:30,950

1858
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:32,910

01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:43,229

So, what happened to Michael?

1882
01:47:11,240 --> 01:47:12,355
<i>I need an ending.</i>

1886
01:47:19,240 --> 01:47:22,358
Think it over. Have a read.
You know my fee.

1887
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:24,829
I'm off to La La
to talk to the competition.

1888
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:28,916
Think about that. Got a plane to catch.
And I'm gone.

1889
01:47:34,040 --> 01:47:35,360
Good afternoon.

1890
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:39,671
So, it's Heathrow Airport,
please, Terminal 3,

1891
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:41,990

<i>Buenas tardes,</i> Fletcher-mondo.

Raymond. Well, well, well.

1894
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:53,511
A man of many vocations, aren't you?

1895
01:48:02,960 --> 01:48:05,395
Now, I want you to play
a game with me, Fletcher.

1896
01:48:11,080 --> 01:48:12,275
