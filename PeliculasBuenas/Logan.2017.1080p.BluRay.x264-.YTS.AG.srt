1
00:00:58,457 --> 00:01:02,059
We get the wheels, we get la feria,
we keep moving on. No messing around.

2
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,329
You mess those wheels up this time,
Chong, I'm gonna have your ass.

3
00:01:04,463 --> 00:01:05,430
Move!

4
00:01:06,098 --> 00:01:08,259
- Right there, homes.
- There's nobody, homes.

5
00:01:08,467 --> 00:01:09,434
Where's your party, boy?

6
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,034
Turn down the radio.

7
00:01:11,236 --> 00:01:12,567
You inviting the cops, too, or what?

8
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,762
I want el cromo.

9
00:01:15,407 --> 00:01:18,409
Gonna get some green
for this shit right here, homes.

10
00:01:20,145 --> 00:01:21,112
Fuck.

11
00:01:24,449 --> 00:01:25,416
Hey.

12
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:41,695
Uh, guys?

13
00:01:42,968 --> 00:01:45,368
Those are chrome-plated lugs.
You're gonna strip them.

14
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,537
Look at this guy, eh?

15
00:01:46,738 --> 00:01:48,365
The plating flakes off.

16
00:01:48,573 --> 00:01:49,631
Yeah?

17
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,206
This is a lease.
No one's gonna pay to ride...

18
00:02:04,956 --> 00:02:05,923
Shit.

19
00:02:10,462 --> 00:02:11,258
Come on, man.

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,434
Uh, guys, guys.

21
00:02:17,636 --> 00:02:18,762
What the fuck?

22
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,495
Guys, seriously, you don't wanna do this.

23
00:02:25,143 --> 00:02:26,508
Take him out.

24
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,311
Fuck him up!

25
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,858
No! Not the car!

26
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:49,529
Get that puto!

27
00:02:50,335 --> 00:02:51,324
Fuck him up, man!

28
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:54,806
Fuck him up!

29
00:02:57,576 --> 00:02:58,668
Get him!

30
00:02:58,877 --> 00:03:00,139
Hit that fool!

31
00:03:05,183 --> 00:03:06,115
Motherfucker!

32
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,509
Shit.

33
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,859
Fuck.

34
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:52,480
Everyone's asleep, Burt.

35
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,961
Sleepwalking. Between the ice caps,
the pornographers, poisoned water, mutants...

36
00:04:57,529 --> 00:04:58,791
it's all connected.

37
00:04:59,097 --> 00:05:00,962
Hey, Clyde. It's 2029.

38
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,566
Why are we still talking about mutants?

39
00:05:04,936 --> 00:05:07,336
Hey, it's me. I'm in the car.

40
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:08,506
Yeah, it was a good trip.

41
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,468
Killed it up and down the fence.

42
00:05:11,676 --> 00:05:14,144
USA! USA! USA!

43
00:05:17,315 --> 00:05:20,944
USA! USA! USA! USA!

44
00:05:48,046 --> 00:05:49,343
Wolverine.

45
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:52,283
I knew it was you.

46
00:05:53,318 --> 00:05:55,013
- Oh, fuck.
- Please!

47
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,710
I'm in trouble!

48
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,980
You're the only one that could help!

49
00:06:01,326 --> 00:06:02,953
Get the fuck away from me!

50
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,493
Please!

51
00:06:10,268 --> 00:06:11,565
Logan!

52
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,739
Who was that?

53
00:06:17,942 --> 00:06:19,876
I don't know, some crazy lady. Don't worry.

54
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,869
As I live and breathe, the Wolverine.

55
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,138
And he's a junkie now.

56
00:07:28,346 --> 00:07:29,745
Who the fuck are you?

57
00:07:31,082 --> 00:07:33,414
You know, you got some buckshot in your door.

58
00:07:33,818 --> 00:07:35,285
I heard you was in Phoenix.

59
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,549
But then, last night, some friends
of mine in Texas HP called...

60
00:07:39,758 --> 00:07:43,253
and told me they found
three dead cholos in a pullout on 54.

61
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:46,559
Not unusual, I know.

62
00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:49,233
Except one was missing a hand,
another one a leg.

63
00:07:50,368 --> 00:07:54,995
So they was thinking it was either
an escaped tiger or Freddy Krueger.

64
00:07:55,807 --> 00:08:00,745
But neither one of them can drive,
one being fictional, the other one extinct.

65
00:08:00,945 --> 00:08:05,081
And since the wheel lugs they found
belonged to a '24 Chrysler...

66
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:09,811
and, well... this is a '24 Chrysler.

67
00:08:11,823 --> 00:08:13,757
She found you yet?

68
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,084
Gabriela?

69
00:08:17,195 --> 00:08:18,355
See...

70
00:08:18,563 --> 00:08:21,031
I'm not looking for you, Wolvie.

71
00:08:21,232 --> 00:08:24,998
Well, not really. I'm looking
for someone who's looking for you.

72
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:29,033
She took something of mine
when I wasn't looking.

73
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,004
Something for which I am responsible.

74
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:34,772
Mexican lady.

75
00:08:35,814 --> 00:08:37,645
Has her sights on you now.

76
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:41,478
Doesn't ring any bells?

77
00:08:41,686 --> 00:08:44,177
I don't know any Gabriela,
so get the fuck out of my car.

78
00:08:45,023 --> 00:08:45,990
Oh.

79
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:48,121
You know...

80
00:08:49,093 --> 00:08:51,027
I know what you're hiding, amigo.

81
00:08:51,663 --> 00:08:54,291
The old cue ball south of the border.

82
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:56,192
What do you want?

83
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,959
A little co-operation.

84
00:09:06,744 --> 00:09:08,905
I'm a fan, by the way.

85
00:09:17,655 --> 00:09:18,622
Fuck, fuck!

86
00:09:20,425 --> 00:09:22,086
No, Mr. Esperanza, no.

87
00:09:23,094 --> 00:09:25,221
I know I said June, but I need the boat now.

88
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,897
Why would that mean the price go up?

89
00:09:27,098 --> 00:09:29,157
Listen to me.

90
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:31,164
I know you wanted 70...

91
00:09:31,369 --> 00:09:34,672
Okay, what if I could put together
$45,000 cash right now?

92
00:09:34,873 --> 00:09:36,397
Hello? Hello?

93
00:09:36,608 --> 00:09:37,700
Shit.

94
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:42,173
Hey, Sam.

95
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,347
Morning.

96
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:35,661
"I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus.

97
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:38,301
"As well as I do know your outward favor.

98
00:10:38,503 --> 00:10:40,767
"Well, honor is the subject of my story."

99
00:10:40,972 --> 00:10:42,405
He's having a bad day.

100
00:10:42,607 --> 00:10:43,938
They're all bad days.

101
00:10:45,043 --> 00:10:46,943
He needed these six hours ago.

102
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,971
This is not enough, you know.

103
00:10:53,117 --> 00:10:54,448
Won't see us through the week.

104
00:10:54,652 --> 00:10:55,778
I'm working on it.

105
00:10:58,156 --> 00:10:59,123
Your turn.

106
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,415
I've had a rough night.

107
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,119
Poor you.

108
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:11,930
In other news, he told me last night
he's communicating with someone.

109
00:11:12,136 --> 00:11:14,036
He's not talking to anybody.

110
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:15,466
Don't be so sure.

111
00:11:15,673 --> 00:11:17,641
He's got all these details.

112
00:11:17,842 --> 00:11:20,367
I thought that tank was
supposed to act as a barrier.

113
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:23,046
- It's got them cracks in it.
- Just please stop.

114
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:24,682
Bottom left.

115
00:11:31,422 --> 00:11:32,753
You're not listening.

116
00:11:32,957 --> 00:11:36,222
He's been asking questions
again about why we're here.

117
00:11:36,427 --> 00:11:38,019
I think he's trying to read my mind.

118
00:11:38,229 --> 00:11:39,491
That's what these are for.

119
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,692
Eating his curds and whey

120
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,529
Then came a big spider
Which sat down beside her

121
00:11:46,738 --> 00:11:47,830
And frightened Miss Muffet...

122
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:03,512
Friends, I have good news for you today!

123
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,086
It's not about what you do.

124
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:07,223
It's not about your deeds.

125
00:12:07,325 --> 00:12:08,792
You can't live up to God's rules.

126
00:12:08,993 --> 00:12:12,952
He knows that you can't.
It's okay, we're imperfect.

127
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,724
Make way, sir.

128
00:12:17,902 --> 00:12:19,062
I said make way!

129
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:22,364
The new Quesalupa from Taco Bell!

130
00:12:22,573 --> 00:12:24,871
Get it with chicken! Get it with steak!

131
00:12:25,076 --> 00:12:27,101
And with the cheese baked
right in the shell...

132
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,040
it's the next big thing!

133
00:12:29,247 --> 00:12:31,215
Go now while supplies last.

134
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,115
Who are you?

135
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:35,813
You know who I am.

136
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,318
You're the man who puts me to sleep.

137
00:12:38,523 --> 00:12:39,717
We both could use some sleep.

138
00:12:39,924 --> 00:12:41,289
No! No!

139
00:12:46,497 --> 00:12:47,896
What are you doing to me?

140
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:48,827
Charles.

141
00:12:50,468 --> 00:12:52,436
Come on, now.

142
00:13:34,212 --> 00:13:36,612
How long have I been here?

143
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,361
What are these?

144
00:13:58,569 --> 00:13:59,661
You remember what they are.

145
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,805
The shots mellow the seizures.

146
00:14:01,906 --> 00:14:03,533
The pills keep them from happening.

147
00:14:05,743 --> 00:14:07,677
How about you blow on them to make them safe?

148
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:08,971
Fuck off, Logan.

149
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,647
So you remember who I am now.

150
00:14:10,848 --> 00:14:13,146
I always know who you are.

151
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,819
It's just sometimes I don't recognize you.

152
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,147
Take the pills.

153
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:26,724
You leave me alone with that fucking albino.

154
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,364
He doesn't listen to me.

155
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,664
I know a damn speciation when I see one.

156
00:14:31,869 --> 00:14:32,836
A what?

157
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:36,029
Speciation. New mutant, a young one.

158
00:14:36,874 --> 00:14:37,932
There are forces trying to kill them.

159
00:14:38,075 --> 00:14:39,872
- Forces?
- They want help.

160
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:42,541
Forces, forces.

161
00:14:42,747 --> 00:14:45,079
It's too bad you're not
in that business anymore.

162
00:14:45,283 --> 00:14:47,843
They don't want me, they want you.

163
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,420
Oh, yes, that's how fucking stupid they are.

164
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,423
They're waiting for you
at the Statue of Liberty.

165
00:14:57,628 --> 00:14:59,789
The Statue of Liberty was a long time ago,

166
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,228
Charles, a long time.

167
00:15:01,832 --> 00:15:04,392
There are no new mutants. Understand?

168
00:15:04,602 --> 00:15:07,765
Hasn't been a new one born
in 25 years. Not anywhere.

169
00:15:07,972 --> 00:15:09,371
You always thought...

170
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,206
we were part of God's plan.

171
00:15:16,147 --> 00:15:17,114
But maybe...

172
00:15:18,182 --> 00:15:20,776
Maybe we were God's mistake.

173
00:15:30,428 --> 00:15:33,329
What a disappointment you are.

174
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,394
When I found you...

175
00:15:37,602 --> 00:15:41,402
you were pursuing a career as a cage fighter.

176
00:15:41,806 --> 00:15:44,798
A warm capper to a life as an assassin.

177
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:47,170
Hooked on barbiturates.

178
00:15:47,378 --> 00:15:49,608
You were an animal.

179
00:15:50,948 --> 00:15:52,313
But we took you in.

180
00:15:53,484 --> 00:15:56,078
I gave you a family.

181
00:15:56,554 --> 00:15:57,578
And they're gone now.

182
00:15:57,788 --> 00:15:58,516
Logan.

183
00:16:00,157 --> 00:16:01,124
Logan...

184
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,794
What did you do?

185
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:08,460
What did you do?

186
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,691
Answer me! Why are we here?

187
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,630
No one should live like this.

188
00:16:12,837 --> 00:16:14,202
Drugged in a fucking tank!

189
00:16:14,405 --> 00:16:16,669
- It's for your own good.
- No, it's not!

190
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,343
You're waiting for me to die.

191
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:07,743
I don't wanna fight,
but there's things we need to discuss.

192
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,144
What things?

193
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:16,990
Well, would it be considered nagging
if I was to repeat my previous observation...

194
00:18:17,194 --> 00:18:19,754
that the dose is too low
to suppress the seizures?

195
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:23,494
It's what the guy gave me.

196
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,965
Wasn't in a position to make demands.

197
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,501
I almost died this morning.

198
00:18:27,705 --> 00:18:29,138
- That seizure was...
- It was barely a minute.

199
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,274
It felt a lot longer than a minute.
I couldn't breathe.

200
00:18:31,475 --> 00:18:32,772
You're less affected.

201
00:18:32,977 --> 00:18:34,808
You know he needs a higher dose.

202
00:18:35,012 --> 00:18:37,742
And I know you got more money
squirreled away.

203
00:18:37,948 --> 00:18:39,006
That money's to get us out of here.

204
00:18:39,216 --> 00:18:40,945
No, not us. You and him.

205
00:18:41,152 --> 00:18:42,744
You're saving to buy a Sunseeker.

206
00:18:42,953 --> 00:18:44,250
"Sun" is the keyword.

207
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:47,618
I hardly see myself cowering
below decks like Nosferatu.

208
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:48,792
Do you?

209
00:18:48,993 --> 00:18:52,690
Folding your underpants,
and making him spotted dick.

210
00:18:57,067 --> 00:18:58,034
Found this in your pocket.

211
00:18:59,637 --> 00:19:01,161
Adamantium.

212
00:19:02,873 --> 00:19:04,431
If you are planning
to blow your brains out...

213
00:19:04,642 --> 00:19:06,269
could you wait till you're
out on the high seas?

214
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:09,139
- I just mopped these floors.
- I don't need this shit.

215
00:19:19,356 --> 00:19:22,223
A year ago, you asked me to help you.

216
00:19:23,494 --> 00:19:25,189
And God knows I've tried.

217
00:19:26,363 --> 00:19:31,629
But I can't help you, Logan, not really,
if you're not going to talk to me.

218
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,297
I hear you at night. You're not sleeping.

219
00:19:35,506 --> 00:19:37,133
You don't wanna talk about that.

220
00:19:39,176 --> 00:19:41,041
Or the booze you're drinking.

221
00:19:41,712 --> 00:19:44,078
Or the pus you're wiping away
from your knuckles.

222
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:47,181
Or the blood I wash from your clothes.

223
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,712
Or the fresh wounds in your chest.

224
00:19:50,187 --> 00:19:52,178
The ones that aren't healing.

225
00:19:52,756 --> 00:19:54,891
And I'm pretty sure,
you don't wanna talk about the fact

226
00:19:55,025 --> 00:19:56,890
that you can't read the label on that bottle.

227
00:19:58,562 --> 00:19:59,756
It says, "lbuprofen."

228
00:20:01,932 --> 00:20:03,058
That was my favorite mug.

229
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,398
Stay out of my shit.

230
00:20:07,605 --> 00:20:09,004
Something's happening to you, Logan.

231
00:20:09,206 --> 00:20:11,766
On the inside you're sick. I can smell it.

232
00:20:18,148 --> 00:20:19,775
Best night ever!

233
00:20:22,052 --> 00:20:23,246
Hey, driver.

234
00:20:40,804 --> 00:20:43,796
I love you. I love you.

235
00:20:44,008 --> 00:20:45,635
You're such a doll.

236
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,960
Mr. Logan.

237
00:21:44,168 --> 00:21:45,100
Oh, Jesus.

238
00:21:45,302 --> 00:21:46,929
Please. We need a ride.

239
00:21:47,137 --> 00:21:49,002
Not available. Call a cab.

240
00:21:49,206 --> 00:21:50,173
My name is Gabriela Lopez.

241
00:21:50,307 --> 00:21:51,274
I don't wanna know your name, lady.

242
00:21:51,475 --> 00:21:52,874
There are men after us.

243
00:21:53,077 --> 00:21:54,374
We need to get out of here.

244
00:21:54,578 --> 00:21:56,273
Go north, cross to Canada.

245
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,004
Anyone can do that job.

246
00:21:58,215 --> 00:21:59,182
I'll give you $50,000.

247
00:22:00,184 --> 00:22:01,446
How did you find me, huh?

248
00:22:01,552 --> 00:22:03,110
'Cause you are fucking up my life, lady!

249
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,515
The people after you, they're on my ass now!

250
00:22:05,723 --> 00:22:07,782
Sightings were posted.

251
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:10,222
- Laura, go inside.
- What sightings?

252
00:22:10,427 --> 00:22:14,230
People said someone who looked like
the Wolverine was in El Paso, driving.

253
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,989
Said he looked old.

254
00:22:19,436 --> 00:22:20,232
Hey!

255
00:22:20,437 --> 00:22:22,371
I told you to stop it with that ball!

256
00:22:22,573 --> 00:22:23,631
- Bad girl!
- No, please.

257
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,365
- I told you, bad girl!
- No, please.

258
00:22:25,576 --> 00:22:26,543
Mamacita's gonna have to pay for that.

259
00:22:26,677 --> 00:22:27,644
Stop, please. No.

260
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,044
Shit!

261
00:22:33,384 --> 00:22:34,749
They're gonna have to pay for damages.

262
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,653
And she has cash.

263
00:22:37,855 --> 00:22:38,822
I've seen it.

264
00:22:39,023 --> 00:22:40,547
You should get your fat ass
back in your office.

265
00:22:40,758 --> 00:22:41,725
You'll get your money.

266
00:22:44,628 --> 00:22:46,596
Don't let her call anyone, please.

267
00:22:46,797 --> 00:22:48,822
They will find us. They will kill us.

268
00:22:56,974 --> 00:22:58,373
I am a nurse.

269
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:02,076
Was. In Mexico City.

270
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,672
When did that happen?

271
00:23:04,948 --> 00:23:08,247
This morning. Near the border.

272
00:23:11,955 --> 00:23:13,217
I got away from them, but...

273
00:23:15,592 --> 00:23:16,559
...now they know my car.

274
00:23:20,297 --> 00:23:22,629
Look, I gotta go.

275
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:25,028
No, wait. Please. Here.

276
00:23:25,402 --> 00:23:26,596
Please, wait! Look.

277
00:23:26,804 --> 00:23:29,466
Look. Here, take this. It's $20,000.

278
00:23:30,007 --> 00:23:31,804
Here. Take us to this address.

279
00:23:33,243 --> 00:23:35,438
You can have $30,000 more when we get there.

280
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,873
My friends there will give it to you.

281
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:40,815
They will be waiting.

282
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:43,282
They will give you anything.

283
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,547
Where did you get this?

284
00:23:45,756 --> 00:23:47,053
My boyfriend.

285
00:23:48,025 --> 00:23:50,550
He wants to kill me and take her.

286
00:23:53,764 --> 00:23:55,254
And that's your daughter?

287
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,268
Yes.

288
00:24:01,972 --> 00:24:04,406
I know you're still good inside.

289
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:05,597
I know you want to help us.

290
00:24:05,709 --> 00:24:06,676
You don't know anything about me.

291
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:07,777
Please!

292
00:24:07,878 --> 00:24:11,143
I promise, there will be
no problems if we leave now.

293
00:24:11,348 --> 00:24:13,179
I can't just leave to North Dakota!

294
00:24:13,383 --> 00:24:14,850
- We have to be there Friday.
- Or what?

295
00:24:15,052 --> 00:24:17,612
Or we miss our chance to cross.

296
00:24:18,222 --> 00:24:19,246
Please.

297
00:24:20,357 --> 00:24:21,449
You have to. Please.

298
00:24:24,995 --> 00:24:26,019
Please.

299
00:24:33,504 --> 00:24:35,199
- I like those.
- Huh?

300
00:24:35,405 --> 00:24:37,066
They make you look younger.

301
00:24:41,545 --> 00:24:42,842
Charles, listen.

302
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,544
I gotta go away for a few days, okay?

303
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,508
I got a long ride for some good money...

304
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:50,550
but when I get back,
we're gonna get outta here.

305
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,688
We're gonna drive down to Yelapa.

306
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:53,848
We're gonna get ourselves a boat.

307
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:56,025
And we're gonna go live on the ocean.

308
00:24:56,226 --> 00:24:58,194
Will you be safe there?

309
00:24:59,863 --> 00:25:02,661
Yeah. We'll be safe.

310
00:25:02,866 --> 00:25:04,424
Look what Logan got us, Charles.

311
00:25:10,874 --> 00:25:12,034
Be back in a few days.

312
00:25:55,285 --> 00:25:56,377
Shit.

313
00:26:27,784 --> 00:26:29,149
- Logan.
- Yeah?

314
00:26:29,353 --> 00:26:30,445
What happened?

315
00:26:30,654 --> 00:26:32,019
Did something go wrong?

316
00:26:32,222 --> 00:26:33,655
The job was wrong to begin with.

317
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,178
Logan!

318
00:26:58,548 --> 00:26:59,606
Logan!

319
00:26:59,816 --> 00:27:00,840
What?

320
00:27:03,487 --> 00:27:05,011
Who does this belong to?

321
00:27:10,928 --> 00:27:11,826
Who's that?

322
00:27:15,732 --> 00:27:18,166
Thought you were supposed to see shit coming.

323
00:27:18,368 --> 00:27:19,494
I can track mutants.

324
00:27:19,703 --> 00:27:21,694
I'm a glorified truffle pig,
not a clairvoyant.

325
00:27:21,905 --> 00:27:23,532
Go inside and keep Charles quiet.

326
00:27:23,674 --> 00:27:24,971
Go inside now!

327
00:27:34,284 --> 00:27:36,149
You need to turn around, asshole.

328
00:27:36,253 --> 00:27:37,220
This is private property.

329
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,581
Yes, it is.

330
00:27:39,589 --> 00:27:42,681
In fact, I believe it belongs
to a multinational smelting company...

331
00:27:42,893 --> 00:27:44,258
based in Shanghai.

332
00:27:45,896 --> 00:27:48,091
Where are you keeping the old man? Hmm?

333
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:49,697
Is he over there?

334
00:27:52,402 --> 00:27:53,562
Or is he there?

335
00:27:54,738 --> 00:27:55,727
That'd be smart.

336
00:27:57,274 --> 00:27:59,504
I'd like to meet him.

337
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:04,437
I'm told the HSA classifies his brain
as a weapon of mass destruction now.

338
00:28:05,949 --> 00:28:07,416
Damn shame, what happened back east.

339
00:28:08,385 --> 00:28:09,875
He's been dead for a year.

340
00:28:12,055 --> 00:28:13,181
I need the girl.

341
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,379
What girl?

342
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:16,616
The one that goes along with
that ball you're holding.

343
00:28:17,227 --> 00:28:18,751
There's no girl here.

344
00:28:18,962 --> 00:28:20,554
I know you went to the motel.

345
00:28:20,764 --> 00:28:21,958
Yeah, I was called there.

346
00:28:22,165 --> 00:28:24,030
There was no girl. It was just the woman.

347
00:28:24,234 --> 00:28:26,702
Just the woman. Such as she was.

348
00:28:29,606 --> 00:28:31,039
So, you saw Gabriela.

349
00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:35,640
But you didn't call me. That hurts.

350
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,770
You didn't shoot the poor thing, did you?

351
00:28:38,982 --> 00:28:41,246
- No, did you?
- I asked you first.

352
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,783
- I don't like guns.
- Of course.

353
00:28:44,588 --> 00:28:47,318
I wish you'd called me, Logan.

354
00:28:47,524 --> 00:28:48,650
Like I asked.

355
00:28:51,828 --> 00:28:52,954
See?

356
00:28:53,163 --> 00:28:55,154
You're not the only one that's been enhanced.

357
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,067
Logan. Logan!

358
00:29:05,275 --> 00:29:07,243
This is Laura.

359
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:08,978
Caliban, come!

360
00:29:09,513 --> 00:29:11,913
This is who I've been telling you about.

361
00:29:12,115 --> 00:29:13,776
This is Laura.

362
00:29:14,618 --> 00:29:16,347
We've been waiting for you.

363
00:29:21,458 --> 00:29:22,425
Come, come here.

364
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,991
It's okay.

365
00:29:25,495 --> 00:29:26,462
Come.

366
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,191
Laura.

367
00:29:32,402 --> 00:29:33,835
It's okay. It's okay.

368
00:29:36,073 --> 00:29:36,937
Come.

369
00:29:37,574 --> 00:29:38,370
Come.

370
00:29:39,876 --> 00:29:43,437
Come. It's okay. You can stay here, Laura.

371
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,947
It's safe.

372
00:29:45,482 --> 00:29:46,710
We can look after you here.

373
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,317
Come on.

374
00:29:50,153 --> 00:29:52,383
Looks like ex-military. Bounty hunter, maybe?

375
00:29:52,589 --> 00:29:53,556
Worse.

376
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:55,983
Is he by himself?

377
00:29:56,193 --> 00:29:57,217
Yeah, not for long.

378
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,154
You get him back in his ride,
take him out to the wash and dump him.

379
00:30:01,364 --> 00:30:03,025
What if he wakes up before I get there?

380
00:30:08,238 --> 00:30:10,297
Text me where you are. We'll pick you up.

381
00:30:24,054 --> 00:30:25,021
Yes.

382
00:30:29,526 --> 00:30:30,322
Logan.

383
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,551
- Logan.
- Hey. Hey!

384
00:30:33,597 --> 00:30:36,856
You'll get it back after I figure out what
you and your mother have got us into.

385
00:30:37,067 --> 00:30:38,261
- No, Logan.
- What?

386
00:30:38,468 --> 00:30:40,436
I think the...

387
00:30:48,812 --> 00:30:51,610
Logan, the woman that you met,
that's not her mother.

388
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:54,781
- So she talks?
- We're communicating.

389
00:30:54,985 --> 00:30:56,179
Communicating.

390
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,015
Take these now.

391
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:02,617
We have to get out of here.
It's not safe here anymore.

392
00:31:02,826 --> 00:31:04,851
And you can't have an attack
out there, you understand?

393
00:31:05,662 --> 00:31:09,393
Yes, but this is the mutant
that I told you about.

394
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:11,294
- She needs our help.
- She's not a mutant.

395
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,799
- Yes, she is!
- What's her gift, Charles?

396
00:31:14,004 --> 00:31:15,437
Eating? Pipe throwing?

397
00:31:18,508 --> 00:31:19,566
It's okay.

398
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,088
Oh, yeah.

399
00:31:41,298 --> 00:31:43,163
Take the gun. Dump the body.

400
00:31:43,366 --> 00:31:45,391
Text me when you're on the way back.

401
00:31:45,602 --> 00:31:46,762
You have anything else you need?

402
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,562
Food for the kid?

403
00:31:54,878 --> 00:31:56,470
You're fucked now, mutie.

404
00:32:06,823 --> 00:32:07,983
It's okay.

405
00:32:09,826 --> 00:32:11,953
- Choo-choo.
- It's not a choo-choo.

406
00:32:15,732 --> 00:32:17,632
It's okay. Sit down.

407
00:32:17,834 --> 00:32:19,096
- We gotta go.
- What?

408
00:32:19,302 --> 00:32:20,826
- What's going on? Where?
- Stay here.

409
00:32:21,037 --> 00:32:22,470
- Don't move.
- Where are we going?

410
00:32:23,406 --> 00:32:26,000
Hey, don't worry. He will be back for you.

411
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,876
Logan, the girl.
You've got to go back for the girl.

412
00:32:37,988 --> 00:32:40,320
Logan, what about the girl?

413
00:32:42,325 --> 00:32:43,121
Logan.

414
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:51,863
Logan, we mustn't forget about Laura.

415
00:32:52,068 --> 00:32:53,365
She's not our problem.

416
00:33:02,212 --> 00:33:02,974
Shit!

417
00:33:11,454 --> 00:33:12,421
Ah, shit!

418
00:33:41,418 --> 00:33:42,248
Logan.

419
00:33:42,452 --> 00:33:43,510
Yeah, I'm thinking.

420
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,516
The child.

421
00:33:45,555 --> 00:33:47,182
Logan, we mustn't forget Laura.

422
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:48,550
- Please be quiet.
- Logan.

423
00:33:52,796 --> 00:33:53,785
Huh.

424
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,727
- Charles Xavier.
- Where's Caliban?

425
00:33:56,299 --> 00:33:58,199
America's most wanted octogenarian.

426
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,868
I'm a nonagenarian, actually.

427
00:34:05,942 --> 00:34:06,909
Ah.

428
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:09,812
Where's Caliban?

429
00:34:11,815 --> 00:34:13,305
Why don't you tell me
where the girl is first?

430
00:34:13,516 --> 00:34:15,416
Or I could ask Cue Ball.
He seems quite friendly.

431
00:34:15,618 --> 00:34:17,051
I told you, she's not here.

432
00:34:17,253 --> 00:34:19,483
Where's Caliban, motherfucker?

433
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:23,049
Well, I left him in the same ditch
he was gonna leave me in.

434
00:34:39,509 --> 00:34:42,745
Jesus, Wolverine, seeing you like
this just breaks my damn heart.

435
00:34:42,946 --> 00:34:44,811
As soon as I rip it out
of your chest, fuck-stick.

436
00:34:53,022 --> 00:34:54,080
Go get her.

437
00:36:07,263 --> 00:36:08,287
Laura.

438
00:36:12,769 --> 00:36:14,236
That a girl!

439
00:36:15,672 --> 00:36:16,639
Hey, baby.

440
00:36:26,015 --> 00:36:27,277
Laura...

441
00:36:30,286 --> 00:36:31,275
Laura!

442
00:36:31,754 --> 00:36:34,450
Honey, you wanna stay where you are.

443
00:36:35,124 --> 00:36:36,489
You wanna see your friends, right?

444
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:39,423
Command, stop.

445
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:41,922
You said alive or dead.

446
00:36:43,266 --> 00:36:44,233
Laura!

447
00:36:45,935 --> 00:36:46,902
Laura.

448
00:36:48,304 --> 00:36:49,635
Laura.

449
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:51,500
No. No.

450
00:36:53,276 --> 00:36:54,800
Move! Go!

451
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,744
Move! Go!

452
00:37:05,989 --> 00:37:07,684
Stop shooting!

453
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:10,985
She heals! Move! Go!

454
00:37:12,729 --> 00:37:14,128
Holy shit!

455
00:37:58,708 --> 00:37:59,732
Gotcha!

456
00:38:08,184 --> 00:38:09,515
Ah!

457
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,212
Come on, hold her down.

458
00:39:04,407 --> 00:39:06,898
As I told you, Logan,
she's a mutant like you.

459
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:08,399
Hold on!

460
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,775
Very much like you.

461
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,099
Laura, are you all right?

462
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:48,908
Ahh!

463
00:39:55,124 --> 00:39:56,091
Move!

464
00:40:05,034 --> 00:40:06,001
Hold on!

465
00:40:11,874 --> 00:40:13,637
Fuck! Come on!

466
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:16,278
Come on!

467
00:40:23,352 --> 00:40:24,376
Shit.

468
00:41:16,939 --> 00:41:18,736
Fall in! Let's go!

469
00:41:25,615 --> 00:41:26,877
Oh, watch out!

470
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,217
Ah!

471
00:42:10,993 --> 00:42:12,051
Sit back.

472
00:42:21,537 --> 00:42:22,799
Bring me the tracker.

473
00:42:30,313 --> 00:42:31,302
You.

474
00:42:33,182 --> 00:42:34,581
Who the hell are you?

475
00:42:36,018 --> 00:42:38,919
Hey! I asked you a question. Who are you?

476
00:42:40,122 --> 00:42:41,680
You know who she is, Logan.

477
00:42:42,558 --> 00:42:43,616
No, I don't.

478
00:42:43,826 --> 00:42:45,987
Does she remind you of anybody?

479
00:43:17,593 --> 00:43:19,823
I read about you when I was a kid.

480
00:43:21,664 --> 00:43:23,359
I believe you're thinking of someone else.

481
00:43:23,499 --> 00:43:24,466
Hmm.

482
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:35,905
Now, if I'm not mistaken,
you used to work for my team.

483
00:43:36,512 --> 00:43:39,174
You were helping round up
all those old mutes.

484
00:43:40,116 --> 00:43:41,378
What changed?

485
00:43:42,752 --> 00:43:43,741
You got religion?

486
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:51,354
I'm gonna need you to do
one more thing for the good guys...

487
00:43:53,229 --> 00:43:56,665
and track one more special mute for me.

488
00:44:00,803 --> 00:44:02,031
I'm not helping you.

489
00:44:02,738 --> 00:44:04,205
Of course, you'd say that.

490
00:44:04,907 --> 00:44:07,740
But I got a theory that
people don't really change.

491
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:12,608
Beware of the light.

492
00:44:14,383 --> 00:44:18,177
Caliban, I bet that's what your mama
told you every day when you was a kid.

493
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:25,722
Beware of the light.

494
00:44:31,634 --> 00:44:34,364
Now, let's not bring out
the worst in each other.

495
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:35,960
The girl is not worth it, trust me.

496
00:44:36,305 --> 00:44:38,466
She's not a natural fuck-up like you.

497
00:44:38,674 --> 00:44:41,302
She's a business mistake, a R&D gone bad.

498
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:42,704
There's liability.

499
00:44:43,012 --> 00:44:46,308
They can't have things with patents
running around, hurting people, can they?

500
00:44:47,516 --> 00:44:50,976
We need to get her off the board
before she hurts anybody else.

501
00:44:51,187 --> 00:44:53,781
Someone you care about, maybe.

502
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:02,727
So, get to sniffin'.

503
00:45:07,203 --> 00:45:09,228
My name is Gabriela López.

504
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:10,828
I am a nurse.

505
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,242
And for 10 years, I worked for
Transigen Research in Mexico City.

506
00:45:16,479 --> 00:45:19,107
Transigen is owned by an American company.

507
00:45:22,518 --> 00:45:24,952
What I am about to show you is illegal...

508
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,516
in the U.S. And Canada.

509
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:37,326
They told us we were part
of a pharmaceutical study.

510
00:45:37,833 --> 00:45:39,494
But, of course, that was a lie.

511
00:45:39,702 --> 00:45:42,933
These children were born in Transigen.

512
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:48,006
They were born here, and have never left.

513
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:53,047
They have never seen the sun
or the ocean, rain or snow...

514
00:45:54,483 --> 00:45:56,144
or any of God's creatures.

515
00:45:57,086 --> 00:45:58,986
They have no birth certificates...

516
00:45:59,522 --> 00:46:03,382
no names, besides the ones
we have given them.

517
00:46:06,529 --> 00:46:10,397
They were raised in
the bellies of Mexican girls.

518
00:46:10,599 --> 00:46:12,499
Girls no one can find anymore.

519
00:46:13,235 --> 00:46:16,466
Their fathers are semillas genéticas...

520
00:46:16,672 --> 00:46:18,139
special seeds in bottles.

521
00:46:32,688 --> 00:46:34,178
- Birthday? No birth.
- María.

522
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:36,886
We do not dress them up for Halloween.

523
00:46:37,626 --> 00:46:40,186
We do not call them "baby" or kiss boo-boos.

524
00:46:41,063 --> 00:46:42,087
Don't think of them as children.

525
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:43,255
Think of them as things...

526
00:46:43,399 --> 00:46:44,764
with patents and copyrights.

527
00:46:44,934 --> 00:46:45,901
Comprende?

528
00:46:46,035 --> 00:46:47,024
Si, señor.

529
00:46:47,803 --> 00:46:50,732
They thought we were too poor
and stupid to understand.

530
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,340
We're poor, yes...

531
00:46:53,542 --> 00:46:54,531
but we are not stupid.

532
00:46:54,643 --> 00:46:55,769
Use your powers.

533
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,416
This is business.

534
00:47:04,620 --> 00:47:07,054
They are making soldiers.

535
00:47:07,656 --> 00:47:08,680
Killers.

536
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:16,723
These are babies of mutantes...

537
00:47:24,573 --> 00:47:26,632
- North Dakota.
- Mmm.

538
00:47:27,109 --> 00:47:28,974
You took that woman's money.

539
00:47:29,178 --> 00:47:31,578
You said you would take the child there.

540
00:47:36,919 --> 00:47:38,318
What is she?

541
00:47:39,788 --> 00:47:41,415
She's your daughter, Logan.

542
00:47:43,592 --> 00:47:45,287
Alkali has your genetic code.

543
00:47:45,494 --> 00:47:46,620
Not just mine.

544
00:47:46,762 --> 00:47:47,729
Logan...

545
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:48,797
I don't want to talk about it.

546
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:50,057
I don't wanna hear about it anymore.

547
00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:51,497
- Logan...
- Just stop.

548
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,500
I have to pee.

549
00:48:06,615 --> 00:48:07,582
Last ride.

550
00:48:12,054 --> 00:48:13,146
You're welcome.

551
00:48:19,728 --> 00:48:22,360
Stop it. For God's sake,
I can do this myself!

552
00:48:22,565 --> 00:48:23,623
Yeah, well, you're not doing it.

553
00:48:23,732 --> 00:48:24,858
Just get on with it.

554
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,490
Not with you standing there.

555
00:48:26,702 --> 00:48:28,192
Trust me, I'm not lookin'.

556
00:49:02,238 --> 00:49:03,205
Hello.

557
00:49:03,872 --> 00:49:04,896
Hi, there!

558
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,874
You know you gotta pay for that, right?

559
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:11,671
Hey! Where's your mommy and daddy, huh?

560
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:15,917
Come on.

561
00:49:16,118 --> 00:49:17,210
That's enough. These, too.

562
00:49:19,855 --> 00:49:21,823
- Shit!
- Not okay!

563
00:49:25,027 --> 00:49:26,187
Sorry.

564
00:49:27,496 --> 00:49:29,123
Um, do you sell phone chargers?

565
00:49:29,565 --> 00:49:30,623
Uh...

566
00:49:36,405 --> 00:49:37,565
Come on. Get in the car.

567
00:50:03,966 --> 00:50:05,831
As the children became older...

568
00:50:06,035 --> 00:50:08,026
Laura. Laura.

569
00:50:08,604 --> 00:50:10,367
...they became more difficult.

570
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:14,504
They could not be controlled.

571
00:50:16,979 --> 00:50:20,346
The company made their bodies into weapons.

572
00:50:21,116 --> 00:50:23,050
Tried to teach them to kill.

573
00:50:23,252 --> 00:50:25,447
But they did not want to fight.

574
00:50:28,257 --> 00:50:31,021
A soldier who will not fight is useless.

575
00:50:33,162 --> 00:50:36,390
Inside this building,
they are working on something new.

576
00:50:37,433 --> 00:50:40,368
Something they think is better
than the children.

577
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:43,368
Something they say is without a soul.

578
00:50:43,572 --> 00:50:44,800
Would you like to hear
my full lab report, Dr. Rice?

579
00:50:45,007 --> 00:50:46,634
You can't get good sushi here.

580
00:50:46,909 --> 00:50:48,900
It's the Mexican equivalent
of Denver, Colorado.

581
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,770
They must have been successful.

582
00:50:53,682 --> 00:50:56,082
About a week ago, they told us
to shut our program down.

583
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:01,421
They started putting the children to sleep.

584
00:51:05,027 --> 00:51:07,928
We are going to save
as many children as we can.

585
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:10,325
I read about a place, up north.

586
00:51:10,666 --> 00:51:12,395
A place for mutants.

587
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,761
They call it Eden.

588
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:32,416
If you are watching this,
it means that I am dead.

589
00:51:33,555 --> 00:51:36,752
I am not sure if any other children survived.

590
00:51:36,959 --> 00:51:39,257
We were separated.

591
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,452
There is no more money.

592
00:51:41,663 --> 00:51:43,290
That was a lie.

593
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,358
She's not my child.

594
00:51:47,903 --> 00:51:49,268
But I love her.

595
00:51:50,506 --> 00:51:52,838
You may not love her.

596
00:51:54,476 --> 00:51:56,842
But she is your child.

597
00:51:58,013 --> 00:52:00,538
Please. I beg you...

598
00:52:00,816 --> 00:52:02,977
take her to safety.

599
00:52:50,065 --> 00:52:52,260
Is this where we're hiding out?

600
00:52:52,968 --> 00:52:53,992
We're not hiding out.

601
00:52:54,203 --> 00:52:56,228
We're gonna get a couple of hours' sleep...

602
00:52:56,438 --> 00:53:00,199
clean up, get some new clothes,
get a new ride and get outta here.

603
00:53:05,747 --> 00:53:08,578
Harrah's Hotel and Casino
welcomes you to Oklahoma City.

604
00:53:09,318 --> 00:53:12,185
Please keep right for valet parking.

605
00:53:12,287 --> 00:53:13,276
Hey.

606
00:53:13,422 --> 00:53:14,912
The fun never stops
at Harrah's Hotel and Casino.

607
00:53:15,123 --> 00:53:17,557
Hey, keep it out front, all right?

608
00:53:23,966 --> 00:53:25,365
Come on, let's go.

609
00:53:52,394 --> 00:53:53,520
Hey, Laura.

610
00:53:53,729 --> 00:53:54,718
Let's go.

611
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:55,888
We need clothes.

612
00:54:08,777 --> 00:54:09,801
Going up.

613
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:13,948
No, no, stop. Not a toy.

614
00:54:15,017 --> 00:54:17,645
- Uh, no, no, sorry, chair.
- What? Okay.

615
00:54:18,153 --> 00:54:19,279
- Push up again.
- Thank you.

616
00:54:19,488 --> 00:54:20,546
Going up.

617
00:54:20,756 --> 00:54:22,815
Come here. Stand there. Just stand there.

618
00:54:23,926 --> 00:54:25,917
Logan, it's yours.

619
00:54:26,028 --> 00:54:27,052
What?

620
00:54:27,162 --> 00:54:28,151
I'm not gonna wear it now.

621
00:54:28,297 --> 00:54:29,286
In the room. We'll get changed in the room.

622
00:54:31,767 --> 00:54:33,098
You're a low-down, lying Yankee.

623
00:54:34,369 --> 00:54:35,393
Prove it.

624
00:54:44,112 --> 00:54:46,774
This is a very famous picture, Laura.

625
00:54:46,982 --> 00:54:48,677
It's almost 100 years old.

626
00:55:08,737 --> 00:55:13,504
In life, in death, oh, Lord

627
00:55:13,709 --> 00:55:18,442
Abide with me

628
00:55:22,317 --> 00:55:24,478
I first saw this picture

629
00:55:24,586 --> 00:55:27,054
at the Essoldo Cinema in my hometown...

630
00:55:27,255 --> 00:55:29,348
when I was your age.

631
00:55:29,558 --> 00:55:32,857
Who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name

632
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:36,462
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done

633
00:55:47,442 --> 00:55:48,409
Shit.

634
00:56:29,484 --> 00:56:31,349
I've heard that you're a low-down,

635
00:56:31,453 --> 00:56:33,080
Yankee liar.

636
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,549
Prove it.

637
00:56:43,598 --> 00:56:45,395
You read these in your spare time?

638
00:56:47,002 --> 00:56:49,027
Oh, yeah, Charles,
we got ourselves an X-Men fan.

639
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:51,700
You do know they're all bullshit, right?

640
00:56:51,907 --> 00:56:54,808
Maybe a quarter of it
happened, and not like this.

641
00:56:55,844 --> 00:56:57,072
In the real world, people die.

642
00:56:57,279 --> 00:57:00,648
And no self-promoting asshole
in a fucking leotard can stop it.

643
00:57:00,849 --> 00:57:01,873
This is ice cream for bed-wetters.

644
00:57:01,983 --> 00:57:02,881
Logan...

645
00:57:02,984 --> 00:57:04,246
Her nurse has been feeding her
some grade-A bullshit.

646
00:57:04,453 --> 00:57:07,286
I don't think Laura needs reminding
of life's impermanence.

647
00:57:08,824 --> 00:57:11,122
Didn't you say something about
finding us a new ride?

648
00:57:12,494 --> 00:57:14,257
Two more pills in one hour.

649
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:16,288
Give 'em to him.

650
00:57:16,965 --> 00:57:18,193
Why, Shane?

651
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,526
A man has to be what he is, Joey.

652
00:57:22,804 --> 00:57:24,567
Can't break the mold.

653
00:57:24,773 --> 00:57:27,071
I tried it and it didn't work for me.

654
00:57:27,275 --> 00:57:29,573
Joey, there's no living with a killing.

655
00:57:29,778 --> 00:57:31,643
There's no going back from one.

656
00:57:31,847 --> 00:57:34,077
Right or wrong, it's a brand.

657
00:57:34,316 --> 00:57:35,749
A brand sticks.

658
00:57:36,852 --> 00:57:40,048
Now you run on home to your mother,
and tell her everything's all right.

659
00:57:41,256 --> 00:57:44,316
And there aren't any more guns in the valley.

660
00:58:05,013 --> 00:58:06,173
Who are you guys?

661
00:58:06,782 --> 00:58:09,583
More cops? 'Cause I told
the other guys everything that I...

662
00:58:19,528 --> 00:58:21,826
Get up! In your cage, tracker.

663
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:23,657
You did your job.

664
00:58:45,387 --> 00:58:46,718
Fellas.

665
00:59:00,035 --> 00:59:01,525
Shit.

666
00:59:03,104 --> 00:59:04,401
Knock yourselves out.

667
00:59:06,508 --> 00:59:07,736
I'll tell you what. Eight grand...

668
00:59:07,943 --> 00:59:10,173
I'll have her freshly painted
for you, new tires...

669
00:59:10,378 --> 00:59:11,902
mounted, balanced, and complete paperwork.

670
00:59:12,113 --> 00:59:14,848
I'll give you 10 as-is,
if you can forget the paperwork.

671
00:59:16,718 --> 00:59:18,879
Well, you still need new tires, man,
they're bald.

672
00:59:19,087 --> 00:59:20,179
How long will that take?

673
00:59:20,388 --> 00:59:21,355
An hour.

674
00:59:53,989 --> 00:59:54,956
Jesus.

675
01:00:08,169 --> 01:00:10,501
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

676
01:00:20,815 --> 01:00:22,806
Sir, are the keys in... Sir!

677
01:00:23,018 --> 01:00:24,986
You have the keys in it? Sir!

678
01:00:29,758 --> 01:00:31,089
Shit!

679
01:00:54,683 --> 01:00:56,275
Charles. Charles!

680
01:00:57,452 --> 01:00:58,749
Argh!

681
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:30,217
Going up.

682
01:03:48,189 --> 01:03:49,315
Oh, shit!

683
01:03:49,524 --> 01:03:50,684
You all right?

684
01:03:52,827 --> 01:03:53,919
We gotta get outta here.

685
01:03:57,365 --> 01:03:58,832
I'm so sorry.

686
01:04:00,535 --> 01:04:01,866
I'm so sorry.

687
01:04:27,562 --> 01:04:29,120
Emergency personnel are still on scene

688
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:31,890
at Harrah's Casino Hotel in Oklahoma City...

689
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:35,899
where at least 400 guests were stricken
with temporary paralysis yesterday.

690
01:04:36,270 --> 01:04:39,667
Many are noting a similarity to the
Westchester incident over a year ago...

691
01:04:39,874 --> 01:04:41,501
that left over 600 injured...

692
01:04:41,709 --> 01:04:44,410
and took the lives of seven mutants,
including several of the X-Men.

693
01:04:45,213 --> 01:04:46,305
Knock it off.

694
01:04:49,217 --> 01:04:50,684
I said, knock it off!

695
01:04:50,885 --> 01:04:52,409
She's a child, Logan.

696
01:04:54,956 --> 01:04:56,423
And, point of fact, she's your...

697
01:04:56,624 --> 01:04:58,023
How long has it been
since you took your meds?

698
01:05:00,562 --> 01:05:01,551
Tell me, how long has it been?

699
01:05:01,696 --> 01:05:02,993
I don't know!

700
01:05:03,698 --> 01:05:04,995
Two days.

701
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,690
You saw what happened yesterday.

702
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,994
If that shit had gone on any longer,
everyone in that casino...

703
01:05:09,103 --> 01:05:11,333
I did what I had to do to save Laura.

704
01:05:11,539 --> 01:05:12,767
You didn't do anything.

705
01:05:12,974 --> 01:05:15,374
You just freaked out
and had a fucking seizure!

706
01:05:16,077 --> 01:05:19,410
I guess you prefer me
pharmaceutically castrated,

707
01:05:19,547 --> 01:05:21,378
rambling on like a lunatic.

708
01:05:21,583 --> 01:05:23,050
So much easier for you.

709
01:05:23,250 --> 01:05:24,275
Easier? Jesus!

710
01:05:24,485 --> 01:05:26,680
There is nothing easy
about you, Charles, nothing!

711
01:05:26,888 --> 01:05:29,288
Yes, yes, please be
like the rest of the world...

712
01:05:29,490 --> 01:05:31,958
blaming someone else for your boring shit.

713
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,889
I know, Pop, I'm such a giant disappointment.

714
01:05:34,162 --> 01:05:37,962
You honestly derive no sense of purpose...

715
01:05:38,166 --> 01:05:39,190
from what we're doing?

716
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,890
Okay, what are we doing? Hmm?

717
01:05:41,669 --> 01:05:45,196
There is a young mutant sitting in our car.

718
01:05:45,406 --> 01:05:46,395
Yeah, I see that.

719
01:05:46,608 --> 01:05:48,769
And where we're taking her, there are others.

720
01:05:48,977 --> 01:05:50,740
Does that mean nothing to you?

721
01:05:50,945 --> 01:05:52,742
Yeah, means nothing to me.

722
01:05:53,147 --> 01:05:54,478
Especially since Nurse Gabriela...

723
01:05:54,682 --> 01:05:57,082
made all that Eden shit up
with fucking comic books.

724
01:05:57,285 --> 01:05:58,912
What are you talking about?

725
01:05:59,120 --> 01:06:00,144
Give those to him, will you?

726
01:06:00,288 --> 01:06:01,414
Take out two pills and give them to him.

727
01:06:01,522 --> 01:06:02,989
- Logan! Logan!
- Give 'em to him.

728
01:06:03,258 --> 01:06:04,316
Now!

729
01:06:09,297 --> 01:06:10,286
I wanna see it.

730
01:06:34,155 --> 01:06:36,282
Dr. Rice. It's under control...

731
01:07:03,484 --> 01:07:05,884
Motherfucking auto-trucks.

732
01:07:06,187 --> 01:07:07,347
Language, Logan.

733
01:07:07,555 --> 01:07:09,648
And you're screaming at a machine.

734
01:07:09,857 --> 01:07:13,024
Oh, what? She can gut a man with her feet,
she can't hear a few naughty words, huh?

735
01:07:13,227 --> 01:07:15,787
She can learn to be better.

736
01:07:15,997 --> 01:07:17,396
You mean, better than me?

737
01:07:17,598 --> 01:07:19,293
Actually, yes.

738
01:07:21,069 --> 01:07:23,196
And, by the way, Laura's foot claws...

739
01:07:23,404 --> 01:07:25,964
are the obvious result
of her gender, you know.

740
01:07:26,174 --> 01:07:27,334
Is that a fact?

741
01:07:27,542 --> 01:07:29,407
In a pride of lions, the female...

742
01:07:29,610 --> 01:07:32,044
is both hunter and caregiver.

743
01:07:32,246 --> 01:07:33,304
Good to know.

744
01:07:33,715 --> 01:07:36,183
She uses her front claws for hunting...

745
01:07:36,384 --> 01:07:37,681
and the back claws defensively.

746
01:07:37,785 --> 01:07:38,752
Oh, yeah?

747
01:07:38,886 --> 01:07:40,478
Thus, ensuring their survival.

748
01:07:46,794 --> 01:07:47,886
Hey, hey!

749
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:18,381
We should help them.

750
01:08:19,827 --> 01:08:22,091
No, we have to keep going.
Someone will come along.

751
01:08:22,296 --> 01:08:23,923
Someone has come along.

752
01:08:35,676 --> 01:08:37,974
Alert. Alert.

753
01:08:40,515 --> 01:08:42,039
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

754
01:09:20,676 --> 01:09:22,667
Hey, uh, you need a hand?

755
01:09:24,079 --> 01:09:25,671
Ready? Go!

756
01:09:28,817 --> 01:09:30,114
Ah. Good, got it.

757
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:32,687
Come on, let's get home.

758
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:33,753
Laura!

759
01:09:33,856 --> 01:09:35,323
Thank you so much for your help.

760
01:09:35,457 --> 01:09:36,856
- I'm Kathryn.
- James.

761
01:09:37,059 --> 01:09:38,026
This is my son, Nate.

762
01:09:38,227 --> 01:09:39,455
- Hi.
- Hey.

763
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:40,992
That's your daughter?

764
01:09:41,196 --> 01:09:43,323
Yeah, that's Laura, and that's my dad...

765
01:09:44,166 --> 01:09:45,292
Chuck.

766
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:46,297
Come on, Laura, let's go.

767
01:09:46,502 --> 01:09:49,960
Well, can we show our appreciation and
treat the three of you to a decent meal?

768
01:09:50,172 --> 01:09:51,366
We don't live far from here.

769
01:09:51,573 --> 01:09:53,598
- Uh, no, thanks.
- That would be lovely!

770
01:10:01,216 --> 01:10:03,081
My name is Dr. Rice.

771
01:10:03,285 --> 01:10:05,014
But you can call me Zander if you like.

772
01:10:06,255 --> 01:10:10,088
My colleague tells me
you've been somewhat resistant.

773
01:10:10,459 --> 01:10:14,056
He believes you've been
dispensing delayed information...

774
01:10:14,263 --> 01:10:16,288
to allow your friends to stay one step ahead.

775
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:22,263
I'm offering you the possibility
of redemption, Caliban.

776
01:10:23,438 --> 01:10:26,568
To protect the world, and in
the process, save your friends.

777
01:10:26,775 --> 01:10:30,040
The girl is a rather
small price to pay for that.

778
01:10:30,245 --> 01:10:31,940
Unlike you, she's impure.

779
01:10:32,147 --> 01:10:33,876
She wasn't made by nature.

780
01:10:34,082 --> 01:10:35,208
She's a mistake of my own.

781
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:37,746
I did what I could and they
burned me and beat me.

782
01:10:37,953 --> 01:10:39,614
Your colleagues are savages.

783
01:10:40,255 --> 01:10:41,483
I agree.

784
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:43,555
The Reavers were very ineffective.

785
01:10:43,759 --> 01:10:46,592
But I'm bringing new tools to bear.

786
01:10:46,795 --> 01:10:48,887
But I still need someone
to point us in the right direction.

787
01:10:49,097 --> 01:10:50,257
No, I can't help you.

788
01:10:50,465 --> 01:10:52,092
Breathe, breathe.

789
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:54,269
Now, what does he have? The old man.

790
01:10:54,469 --> 01:10:56,164
Alzheimer's? ALS?

791
01:10:57,272 --> 01:11:01,439
A degenerative brain disease
in the world's most dangerous brain?

792
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:03,403
What a combo.

793
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:08,306
Be nice. Now, you know we got company.

794
01:11:08,517 --> 01:11:09,575
That's wonderful.

795
01:11:09,785 --> 01:11:10,911
Everybody, have a seat.

796
01:11:11,119 --> 01:11:12,313
Nate, sit up.

797
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:14,045
James, why don't you sit
at the end of the table?

798
01:11:14,256 --> 01:11:16,247
You wanna say grace? Say grace, baby.

799
01:11:17,159 --> 01:11:19,787
Uh, thank you, God, for this food...

800
01:11:20,495 --> 01:11:22,986
and for our new friends, the Howletts.

801
01:11:23,198 --> 01:11:24,460
Mmm. They came to our aid.

802
01:11:24,666 --> 01:11:25,997
- Amen.
- Amen.

803
01:11:26,468 --> 01:11:27,594
Here we go. Here you go, Charles.

804
01:11:27,803 --> 01:11:29,566
Thank you, sir.

805
01:11:44,453 --> 01:11:45,420
Mmm-hmm.

806
01:11:47,990 --> 01:11:49,480
Oh, there's plenty more if she wants.

807
01:11:49,690 --> 01:11:51,249
She's fine. Thank you.

808
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:52,427
This is delicious.

809
01:11:52,628 --> 01:11:53,822
- Oh, thank you.
- It's so good.

810
01:11:54,029 --> 01:11:55,360
Where are you all headed?

811
01:11:55,564 --> 01:11:56,963
- Uh... Oregon.
- South Dakota.

812
01:11:58,800 --> 01:11:59,789
Um...

813
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:02,267
Well, Oregon and then South Dakota.

814
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:03,768
Vacation?

815
01:12:03,972 --> 01:12:04,939
Uh... Yes.

816
01:12:05,374 --> 01:12:07,103
Uh, long overdue.

817
01:12:07,309 --> 01:12:08,503
We're city folk.

818
01:12:08,710 --> 01:12:12,146
Always wanted to take
a road trip, see the country.

819
01:12:13,415 --> 01:12:14,780
Um... And meet the people in it.

820
01:12:14,983 --> 01:12:16,177
That sounds lovely.

821
01:12:16,385 --> 01:12:19,053
Been trying to get Will here
to take a vacation for years now.

822
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:21,889
Oh. If we go traipsing all over the country,
who's gonna take care of this place?

823
01:12:22,090 --> 01:12:23,955
Exactly. I say, let it go.

824
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:25,148
And live off what?

825
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,021
The Lord will provide.

826
01:12:27,229 --> 01:12:30,291
I'm still waiting for the Lord
to provide me with a new thresher.

827
01:12:30,532 --> 01:12:32,159
All the same, I'd love to travel someday.

828
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:34,794
And I bet you will.

829
01:12:35,404 --> 01:12:37,372
- I could drop out of school.
- Okay, let's not go that far.

830
01:12:37,572 --> 01:12:38,664
I mean, I'll do it.

831
01:12:38,874 --> 01:12:40,000
- No. No.
- Why not?

832
01:12:40,208 --> 01:12:41,470
You wanna travel, I wanna travel.

833
01:12:41,576 --> 01:12:42,543
Son. Son.

834
01:12:43,010 --> 01:12:44,000
That sounds good to you, right?

835
01:12:44,212 --> 01:12:45,406
This is the perfect plan.

836
01:12:45,614 --> 01:12:46,808
Why would you want to do that, Nate?

837
01:12:47,749 --> 01:12:50,183
Careful, you're speaking to
a man who ran a school...

838
01:12:51,753 --> 01:12:53,152
for a lot of years. Right, Charles?

839
01:12:53,789 --> 01:12:55,689
Yes, it was a...

840
01:12:56,290 --> 01:12:59,419
It was a special needs school. Um...

841
01:13:00,629 --> 01:13:02,187
Uh-huh. That's a good description.

842
01:13:02,930 --> 01:13:04,364
He was there, too.

843
01:13:04,566 --> 01:13:05,533
Oh, yeah, no. Um...

844
01:13:05,634 --> 01:13:07,864
I got kicked out a few times.

845
01:13:07,969 --> 01:13:10,932
I wish I could say you were a good pupil,
but the words would choke me.

846
01:13:33,628 --> 01:13:35,596
Ma'am, I can't thank you enough for this.

847
01:13:35,730 --> 01:13:37,062
Uh, it was great.

848
01:13:37,265 --> 01:13:38,960
But we have a long drive ahead of us, so...

849
01:13:39,167 --> 01:13:40,134
But you need to rest, don't you?

850
01:13:40,469 --> 01:13:41,936
Yeah, we'll find a motel somewhere.

851
01:13:42,137 --> 01:13:44,238
The nearest one is two hours
from here and it's not even that nice.

852
01:13:44,773 --> 01:13:47,642
We have a perfectly fine room upstairs
for your father and your daughter

853
01:13:47,843 --> 01:13:49,401
and you can sleep in the living
room on the convertible.

854
01:13:49,610 --> 01:13:50,737
Kathryn, it's very, very nice of you,

855
01:13:50,846 --> 01:13:52,074
but we really should go.

856
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:54,307
We can leave early in the morning.

857
01:13:54,516 --> 01:13:57,781
Break of dawn, as it were.

858
01:14:00,522 --> 01:14:02,456
Okay, why don't we wash up, Pop?

859
01:14:02,657 --> 01:14:03,555
Okay.

860
01:14:03,759 --> 01:14:04,748
Sit.

861
01:14:08,130 --> 01:14:10,655
Um, sweetie, you want some dessert?

862
01:14:10,866 --> 01:14:14,131
Two days on the road,
only one meal, and hardly any sleep.

863
01:14:14,336 --> 01:14:16,327
She's 11, I'm fucking 90.

864
01:14:16,538 --> 01:14:18,369
Well, that's 101 reasons to keep moving.

865
01:14:18,573 --> 01:14:20,541
I'm not a box of avocados, Logan.

866
01:14:20,742 --> 01:14:22,300
And then what? We stay the night, then what?

867
01:14:22,510 --> 01:14:25,969
Then we take her to her friends in Eden.

868
01:14:28,316 --> 01:14:30,580
And then we buy the Sunseeker.

869
01:14:32,187 --> 01:14:33,484
Take the pills.

870
01:14:37,993 --> 01:14:38,925
Oh, shit!

871
01:14:40,662 --> 01:14:42,095
- What's going on?
- Nate!

872
01:14:42,297 --> 01:14:44,265
Go fill up the tub before we lose pressure.

873
01:14:44,466 --> 01:14:45,763
Honey, check the sink.

874
01:14:45,967 --> 01:14:47,332
They shut it off again.

875
01:14:48,036 --> 01:14:49,503
They are just not going to let this thing go.

876
01:14:49,704 --> 01:14:51,103
Well, you might as well handle it now.

877
01:14:51,306 --> 01:14:53,001
It can wait till the morning.
We just had rain last night.

878
01:14:53,208 --> 01:14:55,610
We got three houseguests
and a sink full of dishes.

879
01:14:55,810 --> 01:14:57,403
All right, all right.

880
01:14:58,346 --> 01:15:00,815
The pump station that supplies us
is a mile and a half from here.

881
01:15:01,283 --> 01:15:02,910
Sometimes it gets itself shut off.

882
01:15:03,118 --> 01:15:04,085
- By assholes.
- Hey!

883
01:15:04,286 --> 01:15:05,253
No.

884
01:15:05,654 --> 01:15:07,519
My son is happy to go with you.

885
01:15:07,722 --> 01:15:09,485
No, no, no, that's fine.

886
01:15:09,690 --> 01:15:11,454
The men that do this,
sometimes they can be...

887
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:13,355
- I can go.
- No, you got homework.

888
01:15:13,562 --> 01:15:15,029
All right, I'll go.

889
01:15:15,230 --> 01:15:16,925
Just, uh, let me get my dad settled.

890
01:15:20,802 --> 01:15:21,769
All right.

891
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:25,803
I'm just saying,
I don't care what the lawyer says.

892
01:15:28,176 --> 01:15:31,445
- But it's dangerous.
- I'm not gonna hurt our chances.

893
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:46,686
Want TV? There's TV here.

894
01:15:46,895 --> 01:15:47,862
I'm fine.

895
01:15:47,996 --> 01:15:49,122
Okay. Get some rest.

896
01:15:49,230 --> 01:15:51,199
You know, Logan...

897
01:15:51,766 --> 01:15:53,893
this is what life looks like.

898
01:15:54,369 --> 01:15:56,963
A home, people who love each other.

899
01:15:57,172 --> 01:15:58,298
Safe place.

900
01:15:58,506 --> 01:16:00,997
You should take a moment and feel it.

901
01:16:03,912 --> 01:16:05,812
Yeah. It's great.

902
01:16:06,014 --> 01:16:07,504
Logan. Logan!

903
01:16:09,517 --> 01:16:11,576
You still have time.

904
01:16:14,189 --> 01:16:18,250
Charles, the world is not the same as it was.

905
01:16:20,729 --> 01:16:23,391
We're taking a risk hanging
around here, you know that.

906
01:16:23,965 --> 01:16:26,593
And where we're going, Eden...

907
01:16:27,535 --> 01:16:28,900
it doesn't exist.

908
01:16:29,804 --> 01:16:31,931
Her nurse got it from a comic book.

909
01:16:33,875 --> 01:16:36,241
You understand? It's not real.

910
01:16:36,945 --> 01:16:38,936
It is for Laura.

911
01:16:42,817 --> 01:16:45,217
It is for Laura.

912
01:16:48,223 --> 01:16:49,520
Get some rest.

913
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:56,222
Canewood Beverage bought up
everything out here, except for us.

914
01:16:56,430 --> 01:16:59,025
When we wouldn't sell,
they tried eminent domain...

915
01:16:59,234 --> 01:17:00,792
then screwing with our water.

916
01:17:01,836 --> 01:17:04,304
Couple of months ago,
somebody poisoned our dogs.

917
01:17:04,973 --> 01:17:07,601
So, out on the highway today, those trucks...

918
01:17:08,576 --> 01:17:10,237
Who knows. Maybe.

919
01:17:11,479 --> 01:17:13,447
Hey, look at 'em.

920
01:17:14,015 --> 01:17:17,246
Look like dinosaurs with their 20-ton
bodies and tiny little brains...

921
01:17:17,452 --> 01:17:19,579
shucking their cloned-up super corn.

922
01:17:19,788 --> 01:17:20,982
You know it tastes like shit, too.

923
01:17:21,189 --> 01:17:22,417
Why do people eat it?

924
01:17:22,624 --> 01:17:24,956
They don't. They drink it. Corn syrup.

925
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,855
It's in those drinks
that everyone's having...

926
01:17:27,062 --> 01:17:30,623
to stay awake, cheer up,
feel strong, sexy, whatever.

927
01:17:30,832 --> 01:17:33,630
Used to be a time when
a bad day was just a bad day.

928
01:17:33,835 --> 01:17:35,200
Mine still are.

929
01:17:57,158 --> 01:17:59,888
Those are for breakaway roping.

930
01:18:01,029 --> 01:18:04,965
Those are for barrel racing,
and right here is for pole bending.

931
01:18:05,166 --> 01:18:06,963
They're all second, third place.

932
01:18:07,168 --> 01:18:10,763
I'm not too good at it, but my dad makes me.

933
01:18:19,514 --> 01:18:21,448
Do you want to listen?

934
01:18:31,793 --> 01:18:32,817
Do you like it?

935
01:18:36,830 --> 01:18:39,129
Um, here, you can take it for tonight...

936
01:18:39,334 --> 01:18:42,360
and I'll get it back from you in the morning.

937
01:18:55,216 --> 01:18:57,275
Looks like we're gonna be here a while.

938
01:19:30,752 --> 01:19:32,014
Should hold it.

939
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:33,312
Yeah.

940
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:35,145
Till next time.

941
01:19:35,790 --> 01:19:36,848
Thanks.

942
01:19:38,860 --> 01:19:41,158
Hey, so, uh, how long has your girl

943
01:19:41,262 --> 01:19:42,854
- been like that?
- Huh?

944
01:19:43,298 --> 01:19:44,424
Mute.

945
01:19:47,702 --> 01:19:49,033
Uh, since the beginning.

946
01:19:49,137 --> 01:19:50,104
Mmm.

947
01:19:50,705 --> 01:19:52,730
Well, in a lot of ways, I envy you.

948
01:19:53,875 --> 01:19:56,702
They get to be Nate's age, with the
nonsense that comes out of their mouths...

949
01:19:58,046 --> 01:20:00,344
Makes you wonder the whole point of it all.

950
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:04,240
Shit.

951
01:20:08,456 --> 01:20:09,423
Don't worry.

952
01:20:09,624 --> 01:20:11,057
We won't need it.

953
01:20:11,559 --> 01:20:12,526
Stay here.

954
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,229
Evening, Mr. Munson.

955
01:20:21,803 --> 01:20:22,770
What brings y'all this way?

956
01:20:23,972 --> 01:20:25,371
Why don't you ask your boys?

957
01:20:25,573 --> 01:20:28,366
Mr. Munson, you understand
you're trespassing right now, right?

958
01:20:28,576 --> 01:20:31,112
I have an easement with the
previous owner of your property.

959
01:20:31,246 --> 01:20:32,543
Huh. Bullshit.

960
01:20:32,747 --> 01:20:34,715
"Previous" being the operative word.

961
01:20:35,950 --> 01:20:37,178
Who's this?

962
01:20:38,553 --> 01:20:40,952
Just a guy telling you
to get back in your nice truck.

963
01:20:41,156 --> 01:20:43,784
Go play Okie dickhead somewhere else.

964
01:20:48,296 --> 01:20:49,354
Hey, Carl...

965
01:20:50,098 --> 01:20:53,226
it looks like Mr. Munson hired some muscle.

966
01:20:53,434 --> 01:20:54,731
Looks that way.

967
01:20:54,936 --> 01:20:56,369
He's a friend of mine.

968
01:20:56,570 --> 01:20:58,129
A friend with a big mouth.

969
01:20:58,506 --> 01:20:59,734
I hear that a lot.

970
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:01,408
Then you probably hear this, too.

971
01:21:04,145 --> 01:21:05,703
More than I'd like.

972
01:21:05,914 --> 01:21:07,040
Then you know the drill.

973
01:21:08,249 --> 01:21:11,479
I'mma count to three,
and you're gonna start walking away.

974
01:21:11,686 --> 01:21:12,653
I got rights to this water.

975
01:21:12,787 --> 01:21:13,913
- One.
- I have a lawyer now.

976
01:21:14,022 --> 01:21:14,954
Two.

977
01:21:16,758 --> 01:21:18,089
- Three.
- Ah. Ah.

978
01:21:18,359 --> 01:21:19,587
You all right, boss?

979
01:21:21,963 --> 01:21:23,089
You know the drill.

980
01:21:23,198 --> 01:21:24,096
Pick up my goddamn hat.

981
01:21:24,199 --> 01:21:25,166
Get the hell out of here.

982
01:21:25,366 --> 01:21:27,163
- You okay, boss?
- Fuck off.

983
01:21:27,368 --> 01:21:27,993
Go!

984
01:21:45,386 --> 01:21:46,785
You've had training.

985
01:21:47,322 --> 01:21:48,311
Some.

986
01:22:08,076 --> 01:22:10,169
Hey, don't wake her yet.

987
01:22:10,645 --> 01:22:12,977
Let her sleep another hour.

988
01:22:17,352 --> 01:22:19,047
You know, Logan...

989
01:22:20,822 --> 01:22:23,723
this was, without a doubt...

990
01:22:24,892 --> 01:22:29,852
the most perfect night
I've had in a very long time.

991
01:22:37,905 --> 01:22:39,896
But I don't deserve it.

992
01:22:41,876 --> 01:22:43,070
Do I?

993
01:22:46,547 --> 01:22:48,845
I did something.

994
01:22:51,552 --> 01:22:53,918
Something unspeakable.

995
01:22:59,894 --> 01:23:03,421
I've remembered what happened in Westchester.

996
01:23:08,102 --> 01:23:11,401
This is not the first time I've hurt people.

997
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:16,706
Until today, I didn't know.

998
01:23:17,712 --> 01:23:19,680
You wouldn't tell me.

999
01:23:21,883 --> 01:23:27,844
So we just kept on running away from it.

1000
01:23:32,260 --> 01:23:35,923
I think I finally understand you.

1001
01:23:39,334 --> 01:23:40,596
Logan...

1002
01:24:08,429 --> 01:24:09,726
He's fantastic.

1003
01:24:09,930 --> 01:24:11,159
You said you only needed the girl!

1004
01:24:11,366 --> 01:24:13,459
I told you I was forced
to bring a new tool to bear.

1005
01:24:13,668 --> 01:24:14,828
Your friends had every chance.

1006
01:24:15,036 --> 01:24:16,230
And so did you.

1007
01:24:17,372 --> 01:24:18,430
Nate?

1008
01:24:22,276 --> 01:24:23,573
Put her down.

1009
01:24:32,019 --> 01:24:33,008
Honey.

1010
01:24:33,620 --> 01:24:35,145
Stay down there, Will!

1011
01:24:37,525 --> 01:24:38,492
Stop!

1012
01:24:39,694 --> 01:24:40,661
Kathryn!

1013
01:24:41,496 --> 01:24:42,656
Kathryn!

1014
01:24:42,797 --> 01:24:44,025
Kathryn!

1015
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:13,618
Charles!

1016
01:25:14,695 --> 01:25:15,855
Charles!

1017
01:25:29,210 --> 01:25:30,177
Hold this.

1018
01:25:30,378 --> 01:25:32,505
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

1019
01:25:35,183 --> 01:25:36,150
Here he comes.

1020
01:25:37,050 --> 01:25:39,253
I could pick him up, meet him halfway.

1021
01:25:39,454 --> 01:25:40,887
No, no, no. Let them come to us.

1022
01:25:41,088 --> 01:25:43,181
We struggled with the X-23s.

1023
01:25:43,390 --> 01:25:45,887
We assumed, because they were children,
we could raise them without a conscience.

1024
01:25:46,093 --> 01:25:47,993
But you can't nurture rage.

1025
01:25:48,196 --> 01:25:50,497
You must simply design it from scratch.

1026
01:25:58,139 --> 01:26:00,505
Who the fuck is that?

1027
01:26:05,413 --> 01:26:06,675
Will Munson!

1028
01:26:09,884 --> 01:26:11,215
Just hold on, Charles.

1029
01:26:11,886 --> 01:26:14,013
Munson, God damn it, come out here!

1030
01:26:18,326 --> 01:26:19,293
Munson!

1031
01:26:21,095 --> 01:26:22,528
Come out here now!

1032
01:26:23,297 --> 01:26:24,787
Come out here now, Munson.

1033
01:26:24,999 --> 01:26:26,261
There's that asshole.

1034
01:26:28,302 --> 01:26:29,599
Hello, asshole.

1035
01:26:29,804 --> 01:26:32,705
Listen, I'm willing
to let bygones be bygones.

1036
01:26:33,007 --> 01:26:34,804
I don't know what Munson's paying you...

1037
01:26:35,443 --> 01:26:38,037
but Canewood can start you out at five G.

1038
01:26:38,145 --> 01:26:39,203
A week, that is.

1039
01:26:41,449 --> 01:26:43,417
You best stay where you are, pal.

1040
01:26:43,618 --> 01:26:45,313
I'm the law out here.

1041
01:26:46,187 --> 01:26:47,916
No, no, no.

1042
01:26:49,323 --> 01:26:50,381
What in high...

1043
01:26:52,159 --> 01:26:53,990
What? Oh, shit!

1044
01:26:54,195 --> 01:26:55,162
Shoot him!

1045
01:26:57,198 --> 01:26:58,256
We need to intervene.

1046
01:26:58,466 --> 01:27:00,661
Well, he only listens to you, Doctor.

1047
01:27:03,670 --> 01:27:04,729
24!

1048
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:07,007
Get back here!

1049
01:27:08,175 --> 01:27:09,301
Stop! Stop now!

1050
01:27:09,510 --> 01:27:11,307
Hold this down, right now, tight!

1051
01:27:15,716 --> 01:27:17,445
- Our boat.
- What?

1052
01:27:22,857 --> 01:27:25,018
The Sunseeker.

1053
01:27:34,669 --> 01:27:35,636
No.

1054
01:27:44,545 --> 01:27:45,512
Come!

1055
01:27:45,746 --> 01:27:46,838
24!

1056
01:27:47,815 --> 01:27:49,146
Need some help out here!

1057
01:27:49,884 --> 01:27:51,351
I guess we're gonna have to
take care of this now.

1058
01:27:51,719 --> 01:27:53,186
- Pierce!
- Give me that.

1059
01:27:53,387 --> 01:27:54,649
Get your lily-faced ass out here!

1060
01:28:01,262 --> 01:28:02,456
Listen to me!

1061
01:28:02,663 --> 01:28:04,130
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

1062
01:28:04,332 --> 01:28:07,528
All right, we gotta go around
that truck and flank them farmers.

1063
01:28:07,735 --> 01:28:09,032
Follow my lead.

1064
01:28:09,170 --> 01:28:11,001
Bring extra ammo, take these clips.

1065
01:28:11,372 --> 01:28:12,202
Come!

1066
01:28:12,406 --> 01:28:13,566
Now!

1067
01:28:14,508 --> 01:28:15,805
Pick her up.

1068
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:27,815
Beware the light.

1069
01:28:51,045 --> 01:28:52,376
What the hell are you?

1070
01:31:19,393 --> 01:31:20,655
Sit down.

1071
01:31:39,947 --> 01:31:41,209
Hold still.

1072
01:31:41,649 --> 01:31:42,946
Hold still.

1073
01:32:05,072 --> 01:32:07,207
- Get him on the truck.
- Yeah.

1074
01:32:08,909 --> 01:32:10,069
Go.

1075
01:32:15,816 --> 01:32:17,579
It's all right, it's all right.

1076
01:32:17,785 --> 01:32:20,720
It's all right. You did fine, 24.

1077
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:22,786
You're healing. Just breathe.

1078
01:32:24,258 --> 01:32:26,726
You're a newborn, by any measure.

1079
01:32:26,927 --> 01:32:28,155
Just breathe.

1080
01:32:28,629 --> 01:32:29,687
Your body has work to do.

1081
01:32:29,897 --> 01:32:32,422
Hemostasis, angiogenesis,
epithelialization...

1082
01:32:32,633 --> 01:32:33,930
stromal cell proliferation.

1083
01:32:35,870 --> 01:32:37,599
This will help you heal.

1084
01:32:38,505 --> 01:32:39,995
Make you stronger.

1085
01:33:35,129 --> 01:33:36,255
Well...

1086
01:33:42,236 --> 01:33:44,067
It's got water, and...

1087
01:34:07,127 --> 01:34:08,424
It's got water.

1088
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:27,577
Fuck this. Fuck this.

1089
01:34:41,195 --> 01:34:43,254
God!

1090
01:34:48,535 --> 01:34:50,298
Fuck! Fuck!

1091
01:34:50,437 --> 01:34:51,426
Fuck!

1092
01:34:52,172 --> 01:34:53,139
Shit!

1093
01:35:05,819 --> 01:35:08,287
Fuck! Fuck!

1094
01:35:08,789 --> 01:35:10,279
Fuck!

1095
01:35:10,490 --> 01:35:12,118
Motherfucking...

1096
01:35:16,463 --> 01:35:17,452
Shit!

1097
01:35:18,665 --> 01:35:20,690
Fuck! Fuck!

1098
01:35:48,595 --> 01:35:50,119
Welcome back.

1099
01:35:50,830 --> 01:35:52,560
I was starting to think
I was gonna have to tell...

1100
01:35:52,766 --> 01:35:54,563
that nice little girl
out in the waiting room...

1101
01:35:54,768 --> 01:35:56,235
her daddy's gone.

1102
01:36:02,409 --> 01:36:03,569
I'd always hoped...

1103
01:36:04,378 --> 01:36:08,815
that I'd get the chance
to meet someone like you.

1104
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:10,843
There's so few of you left.

1105
01:36:13,387 --> 01:36:15,514
Nice to meet you, too, Doc.

1106
01:36:15,722 --> 01:36:16,882
But I really got to get on my way.

1107
01:36:17,090 --> 01:36:18,251
No, no, don't do that.

1108
01:36:18,459 --> 01:36:20,859
What you need is rest, and treatment.

1109
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:22,426
You need to check yourself in somewhere.

1110
01:36:22,629 --> 01:36:25,029
- I'll be fine.
- No, you're not!

1111
01:36:25,265 --> 01:36:28,234
I mean, I know that you're different...

1112
01:36:28,435 --> 01:36:31,671
but that doesn't change the fact that
something inside you is poisoning you.

1113
01:36:31,872 --> 01:36:34,067
You got to check yourself into a hospital.

1114
01:36:34,274 --> 01:36:35,901
Find out what it is!

1115
01:36:36,376 --> 01:36:37,536
I know what it is.

1116
01:36:38,479 --> 01:36:41,781
Please, mister, if you don't want to go
to a hospital, maybe I can help you.

1117
01:36:41,982 --> 01:36:43,176
Maybe I can run some tests.

1118
01:36:43,383 --> 01:36:45,715
Look, Doc. You seem
like a nice guy, all right?

1119
01:36:45,919 --> 01:36:47,580
You wanna save a life, save your own.

1120
01:36:47,788 --> 01:36:48,777
Forget we were here.

1121
01:36:48,989 --> 01:36:50,047
Let's go.

1122
01:37:01,235 --> 01:37:02,202
Hey!

1123
01:37:02,803 --> 01:37:03,770
Hey!

1124
01:37:24,324 --> 01:37:26,258
You can't just take shit, you know.

1125
01:37:44,845 --> 01:37:47,006
I don't know how you got me here...

1126
01:37:47,814 --> 01:37:48,940
but thank you.

1127
01:37:49,049 --> 01:37:50,016
De nada.

1128
01:37:50,284 --> 01:37:51,410
Yeah.

1129
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:54,617
You can talk?

1130
01:37:56,790 --> 01:37:58,018
You can talk?

1131
01:37:58,892 --> 01:38:00,587
What the fuck?

1132
01:38:00,860 --> 01:38:01,919
Why in the fuck...

1133
01:38:02,129 --> 01:38:05,131
What's all this bullshit been
for the last 2,000 fucking miles?

1134
01:38:08,135 --> 01:38:09,762
What? Shut up.

1135
01:38:09,970 --> 01:38:11,130
Shut the fuck up!

1136
01:38:11,238 --> 01:38:13,934
Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca, Delilah, Rictor.

1137
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:16,271
What? Who's that?

1138
01:38:16,476 --> 01:38:17,602
Who is that?

1139
01:38:19,046 --> 01:38:22,538
Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca, Delilah, and Rictor.

1140
01:38:23,250 --> 01:38:24,114
North Dakota.

1141
01:38:25,085 --> 01:38:26,347
What?

1142
01:38:26,486 --> 01:38:27,851
North Dakota, por favor.

1143
01:38:27,988 --> 01:38:29,148
Shit, okay. Look...

1144
01:38:29,256 --> 01:38:30,382
No. Por favor.

1145
01:38:32,025 --> 01:38:33,686
This place. Okay?

1146
01:38:33,894 --> 01:38:34,986
Your nurse,

1147
01:38:35,095 --> 01:38:37,325
she read too many stories, you understand?

1148
01:38:37,530 --> 01:38:39,055
Too many stories!

1149
01:38:42,936 --> 01:38:45,666
I've seen it! I've seen it, okay?

1150
01:38:45,872 --> 01:38:46,964
This all here...

1151
01:38:47,174 --> 01:38:49,165
None of this... No existo, okay?

1152
01:38:49,276 --> 01:38:50,243
You understand me?

1153
01:38:50,444 --> 01:38:53,140
- This Eden does not exist. No!
- Sí! Eden!

1154
01:38:53,347 --> 01:38:55,144
It's a fantasy, kid. See that?

1155
01:38:55,349 --> 01:38:58,179
Those are the names of the people
who just made this...

1156
01:38:58,285 --> 01:39:00,048
They made this whole thing up.

1157
01:39:00,554 --> 01:39:01,816
Okay? This whole...

1158
01:39:02,022 --> 01:39:04,853
It happened once, and they just
turned it into a big, fucking lie!

1159
01:39:05,058 --> 01:39:07,356
That's all this is. No!

1160
01:39:08,128 --> 01:39:09,186
Fuck.

1161
01:39:10,097 --> 01:39:11,155
No.

1162
01:39:11,698 --> 01:39:13,529
I know, I understand.

1163
01:39:13,967 --> 01:39:15,832
This is a long way.

1164
01:39:16,036 --> 01:39:17,003
You understand?

1165
01:39:17,104 --> 01:39:19,436
I am not taking you to North Dakota.

1166
01:39:22,643 --> 01:39:25,874
I am fucked up. And I cannot get you there.

1167
01:39:26,079 --> 01:39:29,173
It is a two-day drive.
And I am not taking you...

1168
01:39:29,383 --> 01:39:32,079
Don't fucking hit me!

1169
01:39:32,286 --> 01:39:33,253
Don't hit me!

1170
01:39:34,087 --> 01:39:35,247
Jonah, Gideon...

1171
01:39:35,389 --> 01:39:36,413
- Stop saying those names.
- ...Rebecca...

1172
01:39:36,623 --> 01:39:37,555
Delilah, Rictor.

1173
01:39:37,658 --> 01:39:39,125
Right now. Stop saying those names.

1174
01:39:39,259 --> 01:39:41,693
- Stop it! Stop!
- Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca...

1175
01:39:41,895 --> 01:39:44,261
Fuck it. Fine, fine.

1176
01:39:44,730 --> 01:39:46,392
You wanna go?

1177
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:48,297
I'll take you there.

1178
01:39:48,769 --> 01:39:50,259
See for yourself.

1179
01:39:50,604 --> 01:39:52,868
Let's go to fucking fantasyland.

1180
01:40:05,786 --> 01:40:08,154
We understand the importance
of containment, Dr. Rice.

1181
01:40:08,455 --> 01:40:10,623
But you can't leave a war zone behind
like you did in Juárez.

1182
01:40:10,824 --> 01:40:13,219
Well, try to remind yourselves
that these are all little killing machines.

1183
01:40:13,427 --> 01:40:15,395
Machines who would've happily
disemboweled your family.

1184
01:40:15,495 --> 01:40:16,462
Not all.

1185
01:40:17,630 --> 01:40:20,657
I was told you want these assets
off-board, dead or alive.

1186
01:40:20,867 --> 01:40:22,061
Are you changing my brief?

1187
01:40:22,269 --> 01:40:23,258
No.

1188
01:40:23,537 --> 01:40:24,765
All right, then.

1189
01:40:26,673 --> 01:40:27,731
Save tissue from this one.

1190
01:40:27,940 --> 01:40:30,000
He's a good tracker and had a high IQ.

1191
01:40:35,449 --> 01:40:36,780
Here you go.

1192
01:41:13,587 --> 01:41:14,554
Hey.

1193
01:41:22,396 --> 01:41:23,363
Hmm?

1194
01:41:23,597 --> 01:41:24,825
Let me drive.

1195
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:28,798
Absolutely not.

1196
01:41:34,508 --> 01:41:36,032
Quit looking at me.

1197
01:41:40,447 --> 01:41:41,709
No comprende.

1198
01:41:43,216 --> 01:41:44,706
You are dying.

1199
01:41:47,620 --> 01:41:49,054
You want to die.

1200
01:41:51,958 --> 01:41:53,425
Charles told me.

1201
01:41:56,563 --> 01:41:58,758
What else did he tell you?

1202
01:41:59,232 --> 01:42:00,756
To not let you.

1203
01:42:12,946 --> 01:42:14,743
Hey, hey, hey!

1204
01:42:21,988 --> 01:42:22,955
Rest.

1205
01:45:07,554 --> 01:45:09,044
Keep it steady.

1206
01:45:11,390 --> 01:45:12,949
Swing him toward me.

1207
01:45:15,495 --> 01:45:16,462
Yeah.

1208
01:45:19,065 --> 01:45:21,226
Easy. Easy

1209
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:56,162
Is this good, Rictor?

1210
01:45:56,670 --> 01:45:57,830
No, not so much. Less.

1211
01:46:04,177 --> 01:46:05,576
Hey!

1212
01:46:12,185 --> 01:46:13,413
Where am I?

1213
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:16,982
Hey, what is it?

1214
01:46:17,390 --> 01:46:18,652
Where did you get that?

1215
01:46:18,858 --> 01:46:20,155
Where we came from.

1216
01:46:20,827 --> 01:46:22,862
They gave it to us when we would fight.
It makes you stronger.

1217
01:46:23,063 --> 01:46:24,826
It makes you crazy, is what it does.

1218
01:46:24,964 --> 01:46:25,953
It'll kill you.

1219
01:46:26,066 --> 01:46:28,034
No, not if you use it in small doses.

1220
01:46:28,735 --> 01:46:29,997
It's helping you heal.

1221
01:46:31,504 --> 01:46:32,801
Where's Laura?

1222
01:46:33,006 --> 01:46:34,940
She's asleep down there.

1223
01:46:35,140 --> 01:46:36,972
Do you want me to wake her up?

1224
01:46:44,650 --> 01:46:45,811
No.

1225
01:47:07,073 --> 01:47:08,734
You had a nightmare.

1226
01:47:12,612 --> 01:47:14,375
Do you have nightmares?

1227
01:47:15,749 --> 01:47:16,716
Sí.

1228
01:47:19,786 --> 01:47:21,481
People hurt me.

1229
01:47:23,590 --> 01:47:25,057
Mine are different.

1230
01:47:31,264 --> 01:47:32,663
I hurt people.

1231
01:47:50,550 --> 01:47:52,040
You know what it is.

1232
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:55,785
It's made out of Adamantium.

1233
01:47:56,623 --> 01:47:58,784
It's what they put inside of us.

1234
01:47:59,759 --> 01:48:01,522
That's why it can kill us.

1235
01:48:03,396 --> 01:48:05,694
Probably what is killing me now.

1236
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:09,029
Anyway...

1237
01:48:09,669 --> 01:48:11,364
I got this a long time ago...

1238
01:48:12,806 --> 01:48:16,242
and I kept it as a reminder of what I am.

1239
01:48:18,510 --> 01:48:20,411
Now I keep it to, uh...

1240
01:48:27,353 --> 01:48:28,615
Actually, uh...

1241
01:48:32,090 --> 01:48:34,321
I was thinking of shooting myself with it.

1242
01:48:34,994 --> 01:48:36,427
Like Charles said.

1243
01:48:42,202 --> 01:48:44,136
I've hurt people, too.

1244
01:48:47,173 --> 01:48:49,971
You're gonna have to learn
how to live with that.

1245
01:48:59,552 --> 01:49:01,520
They were bad people.

1246
01:49:05,358 --> 01:49:06,985
All the same.

1247
01:50:22,035 --> 01:50:24,265
Not funny. That is not funny!

1248
01:50:25,905 --> 01:50:27,236
Hey! Hey, pal.

1249
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:29,738
How long have I been out?

1250
01:50:31,377 --> 01:50:32,537
How long have I been in that bed?

1251
01:50:32,745 --> 01:50:34,007
Two days.

1252
01:50:34,213 --> 01:50:35,339
You've been sitting here for two days?

1253
01:50:35,548 --> 01:50:36,947
Hey, go inside and tell
everyone to get packing.

1254
01:50:37,150 --> 01:50:38,674
You can't do that. You can't just stay here.

1255
01:50:38,885 --> 01:50:40,750
We had to wait. It was the plan.

1256
01:50:40,954 --> 01:50:43,218
And everyone had till today
to find their way here.

1257
01:50:43,423 --> 01:50:45,957
If you keep waiting, Alkali will find you
and they will kill you all.

1258
01:50:46,092 --> 01:50:47,024
You need to get out!

1259
01:50:47,226 --> 01:50:49,285
We're leaving tomorrow before dawn.

1260
01:50:49,729 --> 01:50:51,287
We're gonna cross the border.

1261
01:50:51,497 --> 01:50:53,055
It's a safe haven.

1262
01:50:54,334 --> 01:50:55,528
Same coordinates?

1263
01:50:55,735 --> 01:50:57,896
Yes, between noon and 5:00.

1264
01:50:58,104 --> 01:51:00,436
Satellites are blind then.

1265
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:02,870
- Your asylum approved.
- Copy.

1266
01:51:18,992 --> 01:51:20,619
Swing it to your right, Laura.

1267
01:51:24,130 --> 01:51:25,927
A little more. Yeah.

1268
01:51:26,132 --> 01:51:27,463
You see the woods?

1269
01:51:29,602 --> 01:51:30,569
Sí.

1270
01:51:31,204 --> 01:51:32,603
It's an eight mile hike through there.

1271
01:51:33,873 --> 01:51:34,965
And you see that pass?

1272
01:51:35,174 --> 01:51:36,266
Mm-hmm.

1273
01:51:36,476 --> 01:51:37,568
That's the border.

1274
01:51:39,512 --> 01:51:41,309
That's where we will be safe.

1275
01:51:48,620 --> 01:51:50,145
Come inside.

1276
01:51:57,030 --> 01:51:58,520
Laura told me all that you did for her.

1277
01:51:59,032 --> 01:52:01,023
She was lucky to have you.

1278
01:52:03,536 --> 01:52:05,436
Take it. She says it's yours.

1279
01:52:07,340 --> 01:52:09,865
That's why you did it, right?

1280
01:52:12,145 --> 01:52:13,874
Yeah, well...

1281
01:52:14,714 --> 01:52:17,478
Look, I don't need it. You do, okay?

1282
01:52:17,850 --> 01:52:19,511
Suit yourself.

1283
01:52:41,174 --> 01:52:42,801
Your friends, they seem nice.

1284
01:52:43,009 --> 01:52:43,998
Kind of reminds me...

1285
01:52:45,745 --> 01:52:47,144
Hey, hey, what's going on?

1286
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:48,647
Huh?

1287
01:52:50,249 --> 01:52:51,580
You're with your pals. You made it.

1288
01:52:52,618 --> 01:52:54,085
Where will you go?

1289
01:52:55,220 --> 01:52:56,688
Nearest bar, for starters.

1290
01:52:58,090 --> 01:53:00,491
Hey, I got you here.
That's all I signed up for.

1291
01:53:00,693 --> 01:53:02,524
I even gave back the money.

1292
01:53:02,728 --> 01:53:03,752
Such a nice man.

1293
01:53:03,896 --> 01:53:06,057
Hey, I never asked for this!

1294
01:53:06,799 --> 01:53:08,528
All right? Charles never asked for this.

1295
01:53:08,734 --> 01:53:10,599
Caliban never asked for this.

1296
01:53:11,437 --> 01:53:13,428
And they are six feet under the ground!

1297
01:53:14,607 --> 01:53:16,541
Now, I don't know what Charles
put in your head...

1298
01:53:16,742 --> 01:53:19,506
but I am not whatever it is
you think I am, okay?

1299
01:53:20,947 --> 01:53:23,177
I only met you, like, a week ago.

1300
01:53:24,417 --> 01:53:28,213
You got your Rebecca, your Delilah,
your blah, blah, blah, whatever.

1301
01:53:28,420 --> 01:53:30,013
Everything you asked for, you've got it!

1302
01:53:33,126 --> 01:53:34,957
And it is better this way.

1303
01:53:36,462 --> 01:53:38,362
Because I suck at this.

1304
01:53:40,133 --> 01:53:43,193
Bad shit happens to people I care about.

1305
01:53:43,402 --> 01:53:45,029
You understand me?

1306
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:48,707
Then I'll be fine.

1307
01:55:56,736 --> 01:55:59,603
Run! Towards the mountains! Run!

1308
01:57:09,775 --> 01:57:11,003
Run, Bobby, run!

1309
01:57:16,215 --> 01:57:17,182
Ah!

1310
01:57:35,167 --> 01:57:36,634
Go! Go!

1311
01:57:37,303 --> 01:57:38,270
Move faster!

1312
01:57:38,470 --> 01:57:40,496
We need to reach them
before they get to the border.

1313
01:58:57,383 --> 01:58:58,577
Move out!

1314
01:58:58,784 --> 01:58:59,751
Let's go, let's go!

1315
01:59:01,620 --> 01:59:03,053
Run! Run!

1316
01:59:03,255 --> 01:59:05,780
Corre, Jonah! Run!

1317
01:59:12,430 --> 01:59:13,921
I want you to breathe.

1318
01:59:14,133 --> 01:59:15,395
It's just a flesh wound, baby.

1319
01:59:31,684 --> 01:59:32,651
There she is.

1320
01:59:33,118 --> 01:59:33,914
We got her.

1321
01:59:36,655 --> 01:59:38,714
Back it up! Contain her.

1322
02:00:05,350 --> 02:00:06,283
Get behind me!

1323
02:00:27,907 --> 02:00:29,670
You took all the medicine.

1324
02:00:31,310 --> 02:00:32,470
It's wearing off.

1325
02:00:59,270 --> 02:01:00,568
Go to your friends.

1326
02:01:01,874 --> 02:01:02,841
Go.

1327
02:01:04,376 --> 02:01:05,468
Laura?

1328
02:01:07,513 --> 02:01:08,810
You'll know when.

1329
02:01:20,960 --> 02:01:22,188
Nine o'clock.

1330
02:01:24,263 --> 02:01:26,493
That green juice is wearin' off, huh?

1331
02:01:27,533 --> 02:01:30,024
You know, for an old mute,
it's kind of a short high.

1332
02:01:30,536 --> 02:01:32,026
Be hard to keep them claws out, soon.

1333
02:01:32,237 --> 02:01:34,034
Waste this dick, Logan!

1334
02:01:35,307 --> 02:01:37,002
Please stop, Mr. Howlett.

1335
02:01:37,476 --> 02:01:39,600
I'm gonna have to tell these men
to fire on these children.

1336
02:01:39,812 --> 02:01:41,109
You don't want that.

1337
02:01:41,313 --> 02:01:43,611
You can see the effects of
the serum are wearing off.

1338
02:01:43,816 --> 02:01:46,376
You will not survive further wounds.

1339
02:01:46,652 --> 02:01:48,176
Allow me to introduce myself.

1340
02:01:48,587 --> 02:01:49,554
I'm Zander Rice.

1341
02:01:50,756 --> 02:01:52,781
I believe you knew my father
on the Weapon X Program.

1342
02:01:52,992 --> 02:01:56,519
Yeah. He's the asshole
who put this poison in me.

1343
02:01:57,596 --> 02:01:59,029
Yes, he was one of them.

1344
02:02:00,466 --> 02:02:02,195
I think I might have killed him.

1345
02:02:03,569 --> 02:02:04,627
I think you're right.

1346
02:02:04,770 --> 02:02:06,135
Why don't you show some respect, mutie?

1347
02:02:06,338 --> 02:02:08,272
You're lookin' at the man
who wiped out your kind.

1348
02:02:08,907 --> 02:02:10,772
My friend Donald overstates.

1349
02:02:11,844 --> 02:02:14,540
He makes it sound more brutal than intended.

1350
02:02:14,747 --> 02:02:17,944
The goal was not to end mutant kind...

1351
02:02:18,150 --> 02:02:19,412
but to control it.

1352
02:02:21,587 --> 02:02:24,255
I realized we needn't stop
perfecting what we eat and drink.

1353
02:02:24,456 --> 02:02:26,548
That we could use those products
to perfect ourselves.

1354
02:02:27,693 --> 02:02:30,391
To distribute gene therapy
discreetly through everything...

1355
02:02:30,596 --> 02:02:32,757
from sweet drinks to breakfast cereals.

1356
02:02:32,965 --> 02:02:34,057
And it worked.

1357
02:02:34,266 --> 02:02:36,734
Random mutancy went the way of polio.

1358
02:02:36,935 --> 02:02:38,163
We embarked on our next endeavor.

1359
02:02:38,437 --> 02:02:39,995
Growing mutants of your own.

1360
02:02:40,205 --> 02:02:41,172
- Precisely.
- Dangerous times, James.

1361
02:02:41,306 --> 02:02:42,273
You can't...

1362
02:02:42,708 --> 02:02:43,675
Argh!

1363
02:02:44,810 --> 02:02:45,834
Argh!

1364
02:03:01,326 --> 02:03:02,293
Showtime, boy!

1365
02:03:39,030 --> 02:03:40,862
Get up, boy. Get up, boy!

1366
02:03:45,838 --> 02:03:46,998
He did that. Get up!

1367
02:04:00,385 --> 02:04:02,012
Laura! No!

1368
02:04:07,092 --> 02:04:08,059
Laura!

1369
02:04:55,574 --> 02:04:56,541
Please.

1370
02:05:31,476 --> 02:05:32,443
Ah!

1371
02:05:40,285 --> 02:05:41,081
Go.

1372
02:05:42,855 --> 02:05:43,822
Let's go.

1373
02:05:44,389 --> 02:05:45,356
Go.

1374
02:05:46,859 --> 02:05:48,326
Go, go, go!

1375
02:05:49,060 --> 02:05:51,256
Go! Get out of here! Go!

1376
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,093
Go. Go, go, go!

1377
02:06:01,540 --> 02:06:02,939
Go, go!

1378
02:06:03,175 --> 02:06:04,005
Go!

1379
02:06:04,843 --> 02:06:05,639
Run!

1380
02:06:05,844 --> 02:06:06,674
No!

1381
02:06:07,679 --> 02:06:09,112
No!

1382
02:06:46,785 --> 02:06:48,218
No, no. No.

1383
02:07:13,210 --> 02:07:14,872
Take your friends, and run.

1384
02:07:15,080 --> 02:07:16,240
No.

1385
02:07:16,982 --> 02:07:19,576
Run. They'll keep coming and coming.

1386
02:07:19,785 --> 02:07:22,413
Listen, you don't have to fight anymore.

1387
02:07:26,725 --> 02:07:28,750
Go, go.

1388
02:07:36,335 --> 02:07:38,360
Don't be what they made you.

1389
02:07:46,410 --> 02:07:48,572
Laura... Laura...

1390
02:07:53,018 --> 02:07:54,110
Daddy.

1391
02:08:03,595 --> 02:08:06,223
So, this is what it feels like.

1392
02:08:08,300 --> 02:08:09,267
No!

1393
02:08:17,175 --> 02:08:18,142
No!

1394
02:08:31,857 --> 02:08:32,721
Daddy.

1395
02:08:33,692 --> 02:08:34,659
Dad.

1396
02:09:06,625 --> 02:09:09,423
"A man has to be what he is, Joey.

1397
02:09:10,829 --> 02:09:12,456
"Can't break the mold.

1398
02:09:15,367 --> 02:09:17,835
"There's no living with a killing.

1399
02:09:19,004 --> 02:09:20,869
"There's no going back.

1400
02:09:23,075 --> 02:09:24,940
"Right or wrong, it's a brand.

1401
02:09:25,844 --> 02:09:27,709
"A brand that sticks.

1402
02:09:30,816 --> 02:09:33,114
"Now you run on home to your mother.

1403
02:09:34,352 --> 02:09:37,788
"You tell her everything's all right.

1404
02:09:39,390 --> 02:09:42,690
"There are no more guns in the valley."

1405
02:09:59,578 --> 02:10:01,546
Let's go. We gotta move.
