Loggins' funeral.

40
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,553
Yes, madam.

41
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,515
- You ain't related, are ya?
- Related, madam?

42
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:29,187
We're looking for the child's kin.
Thought I saw some resemblance.

43
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,899
No kin, huh?

44
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,109
None we know of, except out
in Missouri some place.

45
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,570
- Missouri...
- Seems you got the child's jaw.

46
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,240
No, madam, just a friend of her
mama's, just passing through town.

47
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,867
If ever a child needed a friend.

48
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,662
"Will I bless the Lord.

49
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:46,996
"Amen."

50
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:48,790
Amen.

51
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,547
Amen, Essie Maye. I just
know your ass is still warm.

52
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,216
Would you like some water, Addie?

53
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,260
We'll get the child some water.

54
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,352
Bless you child, I just want to
pay my respects to your mama.

55
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,264
Well, I'm going to
have to be going.

56
00:04:11,265 --> 00:04:12,730
It's a long way to St. Louis.

57
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,525
- St. Louis? You mean in Missouri?
- Yes, madam.

58
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,193
I sell the good book, madam.

59
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,362
Just moving through the country
with the Lord's good news.

60
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,615
Addie, child, don't you have your
Aunt Billie living in St. Joseph?

61
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,117
St. Joseph, Missouri.

62
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,286
It's her poor mother's sister.

63
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,080
- The child's only known relative.
- That so?

64
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,989
You're driving your
chariot to Missouri, sir.

65
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,792
You could deliver this
child to her kin folk.

66
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,877
Well, I wouldn't exactly
call it a chariot, Reverend.

67
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,903
I'll write the women
a letter tonight.

68
00:04:36,904 --> 00:04:37,904
Hold it, hold it.

69
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,591
I have to think upon
this, you know...

70
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,969
I mean, I may have to make
a few stops along the way.

71
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,762
I never travelled
with no child before.

72
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:48,182
- But you're going that way.
- The child's got no place to go.

73
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,059
Well...

74
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,230
The eyes of the Lord... Expect
I have no choice, do I?

75
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,899
- Hallelujah.
- God works in mysterious ways.

76
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,401
Don't he now?

77
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,361
Come on, Addie. Better get
your things together.

78
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,323
This nice man's going to
take you to your aunt.

79
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,793
- How come you're taking me?
- Huh?

80
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,503
How come you're taking me?

81
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,756
Because I'm going that way, honey.

82
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,260
Although, I do want to make just
one stop before we leave town.

83
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,847
Got a little business
to take care of.

84
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:31,225
- You know my mama real good?
- Oh, pretty good.

85
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,832
You just stay out here
till I come for you.

86
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,709
Don't you say a word
unless I ask you to.

87
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,669
Mr Robertson?

88
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,588
- That's right.
- I'd like a minute of your time.

89
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,340
- Not buying today.
- Oh, not selling.

90
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,343
Just want you to meet somebody,
Mr Robertson. Only take a second.

91
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,469
So what?

92
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,012
- Tell him your name, honey.
- Addie.

93
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,639
- Addie what, honey?
- Addie Loggins.

94
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,144
You done real fine. I'll
be out in a minute.

95
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,022
Ain't she a sweet child?

96
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,982
No, she ain't a sweet child.

97
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:21,279
Well, maybe she don't seem sweet

98
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,693
right now. That's
because she's sad.

99
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,070
That is with her mama being dead,

100
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,522
what with your brother
getting drunk

101
00:06:25,523 --> 00:06:26,906
and driving into
that tree like that.

102
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,908
What are you trying to
pull? Get out of here.

103
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,494
All right, I'm going, but let me
tell you where I'm going to go.

104
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,121
I don't care where
you're going to go.

105
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,914
I'm going to go see
Mr J.T. Faraday.

106
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,125
Now, you know who
Mr J.T. Faraday is?

107
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,085
He's one of the biggest
lawyers in Kansas.

108
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,476
And he don't favour
the man with the

109
00:06:40,477 --> 00:06:41,796
money, he favours
the man without it.

110
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,840
And you know what's gonna
happen to your brother?

111
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,342
There's gonna be a lawsuit against
him. You know what happens then?

112
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:49,053
Everything's gonna be just tied
up in knots, just sitting there.

113
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:52,765
That's his banking money, his
house, everything he owns.

114
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,892
Including half this plant.

115
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,687
Now, don't think that poor child
ain't entitled, because she is.

116
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,900
I was thinking...

117
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,735
couple a thousand dollars
would be acceptable.

118
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,737
Couple of thou? I'll give you 200.

119
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,199
$200?

120
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,325
$200.

121
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,204
It's a deal.

122
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,624
There you are.

123
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,765
That'll be, $67.54.

124
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,350
You sure these tyres are new?

125
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,437
$67.54.

126
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:52,158
Now, we'll have you
to St. Jo in no time.

127
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,328
What time's the next
train to St. Joseph?

128
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,872
St. Joseph? Let's see here.

129
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,790
That'll be the 4:14.

130
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,564
Change trains in Kansas City, and

131
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:03,586
that'll put you into
St. Jo at 9:52am.

132
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,921
I want one child's price ticket.

133
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,470
That will be $11.45.

134
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,097
I want you to send this here
telegram to Mrs Billie Roy Griggs,

135
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,724
Cosmo Road, St. Joseph.

136
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,684
Train arriving 9:52am,

137
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,145
and bringing love,
affection and $20 cash.

138
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,065
Oh, make that $25 cash.

139
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,484
And sign it just Addie Loggins.

140
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,321
Ten words, that will
be 85 cents more.

141
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,949
That will be 12 and 30.

142
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,617
12 and 30, huh?

143
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,869
You better say in
that message there,

144
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,163
love, affection and $20 cash.

145
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:42,333
Love, affection and $20 cash.

146
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:58,140
Now, here's your ticket, and
here's $20 for your Aunt Billie.

147
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:04,105
Well, we got till 4:15.

148
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,525
I don't suppose you can wait
here by yourself, can you?

149
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,781
You hungry?

150
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,616
You want a Nehi and
a Coney Island?

151
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,939
- Ain't you gonna eat it?
- I ain't hungry.

152
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,506
Do you worry about
going on the train?

153
00:09:48,507 --> 00:09:50,192
You'll like the train.
Don't worry about it.

154
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,765
Before you know it,
you'll be asleep in your

155
00:09:51,766 --> 00:09:53,265
aunt's house, all your
troubles will be over.

156
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,615
- So eat your Coney Island.
- She don't even know me.

157
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,700
- She's going to know you now.
- She ain't gonna want me.

158
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,952
What are you making trouble for?
She ain't even seen you, yet.

159
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,465
She never even cared for my mama.

160
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:02,872
Nobody didn't care for your mama.

161
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,583
- And she was her sister.
- Your mama was a fine woman.

162
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,834
Everybody said she weren't.

163
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:09,211
Well everybody don't
know your mama, do they?

164
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,464
How good you know my mama?

165
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,154
Good enough to know
you can be real proud

166
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:14,550
of the happiness she
give to people.

167
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,385
Now, eat your Coney Island.

168
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,140
You meet my mama in a bar room?

169
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,933
Where would you get a
question like that?

170
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,903
I hear Miss Ollie
talking, the neighbour

171
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:26,312
lady. Says one of you's my pa.

172
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,023
Well, don't the world
have a wild imagination?

173
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,361
Eat your Coney Island.

174
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,488
You my pa?

175
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,783
Of course I ain't your pa.

176
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,534
I'll get you some relish.

177
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,330
A Coney Island ain't no
good without relish.

178
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,709
Look, I know how you feel. I lost
my ma, too. I even lost my pa.

179
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,961
I don't even know
where my sister is.

180
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:54,632
I wish I could tell you I'm your
pa, but it just ain't like that.

181
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,761
You met her in a bar room.

182
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,378
Just because a man
meets a woman in

183
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:01,889
a bar room don't
mean he's your pa.

184
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,974
Eat your Coney Island.

185
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,107
Well, then, if you ain't
my pa, I want my $200.

186
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:12,983
What's that?

187
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,611
I want my $200.

188
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,738
I heard you through the
door talking to that man.

189
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,782
It's my money you
got, and I want it.

190
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,034
Now, you... you just
hold on a second.

191
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,954
I want my money. You took my $200.

192
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,832
- Will you quiet down, you hear?
- I want my $200.

193
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,209
Hold on, now, just hold on.

194
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,711
Let me explain something to you.

195
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,879
It ain't as if you was my
pa. That'd be different.

196
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,965
Well, I ain't your pa, so just
get that out of your head.

197
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,717
I don't care what those
neighbour ladies said.

198
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,556
- I look like that.
- You don't look nothing like me.

199
00:11:39,557 --> 00:11:41,595
You don't look any more like me
than you do that Coney Island.

200
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,013
Eat that damn thing, you hear?

201
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,725
- We got the same jaw.
- Lots of people got the same jaw.

202
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,185
- It's possible.
- No, no, it ain't possible.

203
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,771
- Then I want my $200.
- All right.

204
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,777
All right, maybe we
got the same jaw,

205
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:54,024
but same jaw don't
mean same blood.

206
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,412
I know a woman looks
like a bullfrog,

207
00:11:55,413 --> 00:11:56,694
but that don't mean
she's its mother.

208
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,239
- You met my mum in a bar room.
- For God's sakes, child.

209
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,366
You think everybody gets met
in a bar room gets a baby?

210
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:03,659
It's possible.

211
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:07,496
Anything is possible, but
possible don't make it true.

212
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,749
Then I want my money.

213
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,042
Will you quiet down?

214
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,839
You know what the trouble is with
you? You got no appreciation.

215
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:18,340
All right.

216
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,837
Maybe I did get a
little money from

217
00:12:19,838 --> 00:12:21,343
that man, and you're
entitled to that,

218
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,138
but I'm entitled to my share for
getting it for you, ain't I?

219
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,098
And where do you think
you'd be without me?

220
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:29,477
You think them folks would spend a
penny to send you east? No, sir.

221
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,239
But who got you a
ticket to St. Jo? Who

222
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,688
got you a Nehi and a Coney Island?

223
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,440
And threw in $20 extra,

224
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,901
not to mention 85 cents
for that telegram.

225
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,361
You wouldn't have had
any of that without me.

226
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,864
Now, I didn't have to take
you, but I took you, didn't I?

227
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,408
All right, I think
that's fair enough.

228
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:46,786
We're both a little better off.

229
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,622
You get to St. Jo, I get
myself a little better car.

230
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,791
Fair is fair.

231
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,170
Now, drink your Nehi, and
eat your Coney Island.

232
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,383
I want my $200.

233
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:06,639
I don't have your $200 no
more, and you know it.

234
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,705
If you don't give me
my $200, I'm going

235
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,769
to tell a policeman
how you got it,

236
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,355
and he'll make you give it
to me, because it's mine.

237
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:18,567
But I don't have it.

238
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,654
Then get it.

239
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,535
How we doing, Angel Pie?

240
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,538
We going to have a little dessert
when we finish up our hot dog?

241
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,248
I don't know.

242
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,541
What do you say, Daddy?

243
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,919
Why don't we get Precious a little
dessert if she eats her dog?

244
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:40,464
Her name ain't Precious.

245
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,210
I want my money back
on this here ticket,

246
00:13:44,211 --> 00:13:45,803
and I want you to send
this here telegram.

247
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,848
Trip delayed, but I'm
coming real soon.

248
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,214
You just lie down in
the seat and be quiet.

249
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,009
Folks don't take to children
when they're doing business.

250
00:14:59,652 --> 00:15:01,045
- Yes?
- Good afternoon, madam.

251
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,854
Is Mr Rudolf Morgan
at home, please?

252
00:15:02,855 --> 00:15:03,855
Mr Morgan?

253
00:15:03,856 --> 00:15:06,717
Yes, madam. My name
is Pray, Moses Pray,

254
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,552
Kansas Bible Company. He'll know.

255
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:11,639
Oh, I'm sorry. Mr
Morgan has passed on.

256
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,183
Oh, madam, I'm... I just...

257
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,392
I don't know what to say.

258
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,353
What was it you were
seeing him about?

259
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,037
Well, he ordered this
here bible from...

260
00:15:19,038 --> 00:15:21,106
- Bible?
- Rudolph ordered a bible?

261
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,575
Yeah, he ordered this
here deluxe edition

262
00:15:22,576 --> 00:15:23,745
with the lady's
name in the corner.

263
00:15:23,746 --> 00:15:25,027
Lady's name?

264
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,696
Oh, I expect some special
gift for a family friend.

265
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:28,989
But under the circumstances,

266
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,241
I'll just give you back Mr
Morgan's dollar deposit,

267
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,285
and there won't be no
further obligation.

268
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,153
Madam, I just don't
know how to put into

269
00:15:35,154 --> 00:15:36,830
words the sense of
sorrow that I feel.

270
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,833
What, what... what
name is in the corner?

271
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,893
I don't really know
what name Mr...

272
00:15:41,894 --> 00:15:44,213
Morgan had put in
the corner, madam.

273
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,422
Let's see, now.

274
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,841
It's here somewhere. I've got it.

275
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,134
Here it is.

276
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,844
- Pearl...
- Pearl.

277
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,262
I'm Pearl.

278
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,641
Well, he must have got this
here good book for you, madam.

279
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,018
Yes. Yes, he bought it for me.

280
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,270
Of course, now, you're
not obliged to take it.

281
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,897
Of course I'll take it.

282
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,732
There's just one
thing. You see, I...

283
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:05,859
I told him that I could
sell him a cheaper bible,

284
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,894
but no, naturally he
wanted the best, the

285
00:16:07,895 --> 00:16:09,822
best, of course, being
the deluxe edition

286
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,324
with the lady's name printed in
child-in-the-manger gold letters.

287
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:13,742
Oh, he would.

288
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:16,829
Bringing a balance due
of... $8.00? $8.00.

289
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,372
$8.00?

290
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,417
Well, that's, $8.00 minus
the dollar deposit,

291
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,335
making it $7.00.

292
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,837
I'll go get my purse.

293
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,790
Well, you're not obliged
to take it, now.

294
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:27,840
Of course I'm obliged.

295
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,592
He ordered the deluxe.

296
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:35,264
But cold or no cold, it's good
to be back in old Manhattan.

297
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,183
Well, tell me, Jack, you've been
in town now since Thursday.

298
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,739
What have you been
doing with yourself?

299
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,894
Oh, I've had a lot of fun, Don.

300
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,439
I saw some shows, went to
a couple of nightclubs,

301
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,485
and last night, I
was invited over to

302
00:16:45,486 --> 00:16:47,276
Fred Allen's apartment for dinner.

303
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,381
Oh, Fred Allen?

304
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,112
Yeah, he and I are
pretty good friends now.

305
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:53,365
Well, I'm glad to hear it. Has
Fred got a nice apartment?

306
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,159
Oh, how could I tell, Don,

307
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:58,849
with all that laundry
hanging in the living room?

308
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,208
Ain't you gonna go to sleep?

309
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,794
Don't you want to hear Jack Benny?

310
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,755
No.

311
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,840
I don't want to sound catty...

312
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,401
You're too young to
smoke. You're going

313
00:17:44,402 --> 00:17:46,126
to set this whole place on fire.

314
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:15,072
I now owe you $103.72.

315
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:19,076

Frank D. Roosevelt said we're

00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:49,857
He did, did he?

327
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,036
Made me feel good
when he said that.

328
00:18:52,037 --> 00:18:53,610
Better than I've
felt in a long time.

329
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,155
Bet old Frank sure
does wish he was 21.

330
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,577
You don't like me, do you?

331
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,581
No, I don't like you.

332
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:13,797
Yes?

333
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,717
Afternoon, madam. I was wondering
if Mr Bates might be at home.

334
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,845
Mr Bates is dead. He
died over a week ago.

335
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,430
Oh, you mean he
passed over, madam?

336
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,057
Why, I was just talking to him
not less than a month ago.

337
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,809
- What was it you wanted?
- Well...

338
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,312
My name is Pray,
Kansas Bible Company.

339
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,439
I'm just here to deliver this
bible that Mr Bates ordered.

340
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,690
Bible?

341
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,650
Who is it? What's the trouble?

342
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:37,154
Something about Benjamin
buying a bible.

343
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,114
Bible? What kind of bible?

344
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,117
He said he talked to Benjamin,
less than a month ago.

345
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,870
Well, I'm not exactly
sure of the dates, madam.

346
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,830
Well, I don't see how.

347
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,806
Benjamin didn't go
nowhere near that shop

348
00:19:48,807 --> 00:19:50,459
for more than a month
before he died.

349
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,253
Well, I may be a little
mixed up on the dates.

350
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,422
What company you say you're from?

351
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,799
The Kansas Bible
Company, out of Wichita.

352
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,509
Kansas Bible Company?

353
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,553
I ain't never heard of
no Kansas Bible Company.

354
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,888
Daddy...

355
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:06,808
Can't we go now? I want to get
to church and pray for Mama.

356
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:11,271
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Sure we can, honey.

357
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,023
Daddy was just fixing to leave.

358
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,943
This here is my little girl.
It's just the two of us now.

359
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:18,987
- My Mama's gone to the Lord.
- Oh, so has poor Mr Bates, honey.

360
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,073
I'll just, give you back
his dollar deposit,

361
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,533
and you let us know if
there's anything we can do.

362
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,411
Hold on, there. Wait
one damn minute.

363
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,707
He actually done
ordered a bible, huh?

364
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:32,345
He sure did. Here
it is, right here

365
00:20:32,346 --> 00:20:33,877
in gold for somebody
named "Marie".

366
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,542
That's her. She's Marie.

367
00:20:35,543 --> 00:20:37,881
Oh, she sure did
mean a lot to him.

368
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,425
He especially had me get
the deluxe edition.

369
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,664
- How much to keep this here book?
- Oh, well, that one is the...

370
00:20:42,665 --> 00:20:44,096
It's the $12 one, Daddy.

371
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,931
- $12?
- $12?

372
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,475
Yeah, well, honey, we have to have
a little goodness in our hearts,

373
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,973
I mean, considering
the circumstances.

374
00:20:49,974 --> 00:20:51,061
Never mind the circumstances.

375
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,815
And if it'll make that
woman happy, I'll take it.

376
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:11,331
You owe me $85.74.

377
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,466
I mean, we're going to
Washington on the QT.

378
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,738
Molly, she says we
can't go on the QT,

379
00:21:23,739 --> 00:21:25,739
we've got to take
the Pennsylvania.

380
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,931
Hey, I'd better get going.

381
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,725
Hey, Molly, where's my
suitcase? Do you know?

382
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,935
I'm sure I don't know, McGee.
You had it last night.

383
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,354
Oh, I know where it is. It's
right here in the hall...

384
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,523
He's going to open the closet.

385
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,867
Now he's going to say how he's got
to straighten the closet out.

386
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,494
Got to straighten out that
closet one of these days.

387
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:52,456
How'd you like to do a
little business with me?

388
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,125
You mean instead
of paying me back?

389
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,631
Now, don't get nervous.
I'll pay you back.

390
00:21:56,632 --> 00:21:58,031
I'm just saying, while
we're heading east,

391
00:21:58,032 --> 00:22:00,225
how'd you like to do a little
business together, that's all?

392
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,103
Well, you're looking
at me like I'm

393
00:22:04,104 --> 00:22:05,135
out to cheat you or something.

394
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,512
I am offering you a business
proposition. Take it or leave it.

395
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,232
And turn off that
radio. You're like

396
00:22:09,233 --> 00:22:10,891
to drive us all deaf
with that radio.

397
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,604
In an average way, of course.

398
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,695
Ok, I want you to
remember one thing:

399
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,238
I decide on the price.

400
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,837
Maybe you don't know
French, but there's

401
00:22:26,838 --> 00:22:28,367
something in this world
called "finesse".

402
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,452
$12. I never sold
no bible for $12.

403
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,704
That man was a law officer. You
could've had me put me in jail.

404
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,623
We got it, didn't we?

405
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:38,293
I don't care if we got it. Don't
you go making the decisions.

406
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,404
I make the decisions.
All you got to

407
00:22:40,405 --> 00:22:42,464
do is look like a
pretty little girl.

408
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:50,514
You ain't got something like a
ribbon in that cigar box, do you?

409
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:54,518
I got my mum's kimono in my
suitcase, Chinamen with umbrellas.

410
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,105
That ain't quite
what I had in mind.

411
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,282
You look real nice in that ribbon.

412
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,701
First off, I didn't know
was she a boy or a girl?

413
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,161
I'm a girl.

414
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,831
Well, it makes all the difference.

415
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,875
Ain't she got a sweet
little face, somehow.

416
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,462
Well, seeing how I
just got paid today,

417
00:23:20,463 --> 00:23:21,795
we'll take a ribbon
in each colour.

418
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,171
How much that going
to set me back?

419
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,340
Well, that'll be 15 cents.

420
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:29,136
Bought my grandchildren ribbons
just like this last holiday time.

421
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,555
Grandchildren? I don't believe it.

422
00:23:31,566 --> 00:23:32,566
You break a five?

423
00:23:32,567 --> 00:23:34,474
Well, you can believe
it, all right.

424
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,726
I'm just as old as I look.

425
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,937
Well, now, here you be.

426
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:43,316
That's one, two,
three, four, five.

427
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,402
This old wallet of mine is
about to bust its sides.

428
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,988
I'll give you five ones back,
you give me that $5 bill.

429
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,656
How many grandchildren
you got altogether?

430
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,692
Well, I got two little
granddaughters,

431
00:23:51,693 --> 00:23:53,326
a nine-year-old, a ten-year-old,

432
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,996
two grandsons near 16,

433
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,874
and I got a grandson 35 years old.

434
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,792
Come on, you're pulling my leg.

435
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,748
Why don't you just
give me a $10 bill?

436
00:24:02,749 --> 00:24:04,504
Here's the $5, and
five ones, there.

437
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,339
That way I won't be so quick
to see it break apart.

438
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:10,135
- Six children, huh? My, my, my...
- I've got a daughter, 51.

439
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,137
Oh, now, I don't mean to
be handing you no line,

440
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,931
but that's just pretty hard to

441
00:24:13,932 --> 00:24:16,070
believe you got a
51-year-old child.

442
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:17,559
You can believe it, all right.

443
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,979
Well, I'm afraid I'd have to see
it to believe it. Much obliged.

444
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:24,483
- See you again.
- You all come back.

445
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:42,501
That just don't seem
quite right... somehow.

446
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:49,379
Yes?

447
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,343
I'm looking for Mr Stanley, madam.

448
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,886
Mr Stanley's dead.

449
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,056
Oh, well, I'm looking for Mr
Warren M. Stanley, madam.

450
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,141
Warren's passed on, sir.

451
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,392
Oh, that's hard to believe.

452
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,728
I was just talking to Warren
not more than two weeks back.

453
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,563
He ordered this
here bible from me.

454
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,941
Warren spent money on a bible?

455
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,401
Yes, madam, with the name
Elvira in the corner.

456
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,946
Why would Warren spend
money on a bible?

457
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,948
He took fast to the idea, madam.

458
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,908
Only thing is, he left
a balance due of,

459
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,952
well, let's see, not counting
the dollar deposit...

460
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,454
Daddy, this one's
already paid for.

461
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,959
Mr Stanley paid for the whole
thing, don't you remember?

462
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,933
Afternoon, madam. Mr Huff at home?

463
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,769
Mr Huff passed away,
young man, a week ago.

464
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,363
Oh, gee, I'm sorry.
I was just talking

465
00:25:44,364 --> 00:25:45,814
to Mr Huff not more
than a month ago.

466
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,190
What was it you wanted?

467
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:50,527
Oh, well, my name is Pray,
Kansas Bible Company.

468
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,113
Mr Huff ordered this bible as a
gift for someone named Edna.

469
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,115
Oh, that's my name.

470
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,754
You don't have to take
it if you don't want to.

471
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:58,929
I'll just give you back Amos's
dollar deposit and then...

472
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:01,371
Of course I want to keep it.

473
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,207
He bought me a bible.

474
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:06,501
Yes, madam. Now, I told Amos I
could sell him a cheaper one,

475
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,753
but no, naturally,
he wanted the best,

476
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:11,131
the best, of course,
being the deluxe edition

477
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,466
with the name printed in
child-in-the-manger gold letters,

478
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,177
- bringing up a balance due of...
- of $24.

479
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,555
$24. I'll get my purse.

480
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,307
What's your name, honey?

481
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,435
- Addie.
- Addie. What a sweet little name.

482
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,686
Addie Pray, madam.

483
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:28,189
Well, Addie Pray, I'm
going to give you $24,

484
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:31,818
and an extra $5 for
just coming to my door.

485
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,654
- Praise the Lord.
- Praise the Lord.

486
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:48,585
♪ Keep your sunny side up, up ♪

487
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,713
♪ Hide the side that gets blue ♪

488
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,813
- Moze, let's give him some money.
- No.

489
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:12,359
Just a little bit. We got $305.16.

490
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,319
Whole another business
giving it away.

491
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,998
It's bad enough you
give away bibles.

492
00:27:15,999 --> 00:27:17,016
But they're poorly.

493
00:27:17,017 --> 00:27:18,740
The whole country's poorly,
I told you before.

494
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:21,034
But Frank D. Roosevelt says we
got to look out for one another.

495
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,577
I don't care about
Frank D. Roosevelt.

496
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,204
- But he says it.
- That so?

497
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,750
Why don't you ask Frank
D. Roosevelt what

498
00:27:25,751 --> 00:27:27,123
he thinks about taking
care of himself?

499
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,625
You think he don't eat
off silver trays?

500
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,062
He could eat off
table tops like the

501
00:27:30,063 --> 00:27:31,503
rest of us, but he
don't. You know why?

502
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,421
Because that would
make him look common.

503
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,843
And besides, Frank
D. Roosevelt ain't

504
00:27:34,844 --> 00:27:36,091
running this thing,
I'm running it.

505
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,360
So don't you make
up no rules about

506
00:27:37,361 --> 00:27:38,363
what we're going to give away.

507
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,845
It's my money too, you
know. $200 belong to me,

508
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,472
- and don't you forget that.
- You want it?

509
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:43,839
Well, just put my
share in my pocket,

510
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,100
and I'll take you
to a train station.

511
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,143
How do you like that?

512
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,314
Get the map. Find out where
the nearest depot is.

513
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,857
Nothing but trouble, anyway.

514
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,829
First you charge too much,
then you want to give it away.

515
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,153
- Where are we now?
- We just left Plainville.

516
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,239
$12 for a bible,
then it's up to $24.

517
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,616
If I stay with you, I'll spend
the rest of my life in jail.

518
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:04,035
There's a depot in Lincoln.
You can take me to Lincoln.

519
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,245
You bet I will.

520
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,871
- Where's Lincoln?
- Clear over there.

521
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,915
Oh, boy, you think I'm going
to take you clear over there

522
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,208
just to get you to some depot?

523
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,168
Then keep going east. We'll
hit one in Sylvan Grove.

524
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,879
- Where's Sylvan Grove?
- Right here.

525
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,464
Well, that'll take us
down through Lucas.

526
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,383
We got to go through something
to get to Sylvan Grove.

527
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:19,706
I'm not complaining.
I'm just saying

528
00:28:19,707 --> 00:28:20,760
that'll take you through Lucas.

529
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,388
You got to go through Paradox and
Waldo and Lorraine and Lucas

530
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,848
if you want to get
to Sylvan Grove.

531
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,185
Those are pretty
good towns in there.

532
00:28:26,186 --> 00:28:27,353
We could do some
business in there.

533
00:28:27,354 --> 00:28:29,352
Well, it won't matter much. We're
near out of bibles anyway.

534
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:30,856
What do you mean, we're
out of bibles? Why

535
00:28:30,857 --> 00:28:32,157
didn't you tell me
we're out of bibles?

536
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,565
You look in the box
too, don't you?

537
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,135
Well, you've got an
excuse for everything.

538
00:28:35,136 --> 00:28:36,404
Because you blame
me for everything.

539
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,778
If we were running out of bibles,
you should have told me.

540
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:39,867
We're running out of bibles.

541
00:28:39,868 --> 00:28:41,114
Well, then we got to get new ones.

542
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:42,210
Then let's get new ones.

543
00:28:42,211 --> 00:28:43,658
We can pick some up in Great Bend.

544
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,275
Great Bend's the other way.

545
00:28:45,276 --> 00:28:47,412
Well, we gotta have
bibles, don't we?

546
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,109
Let's see, now, we
can veer down to

547
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,790
Lucas, and we'll
veer over to Wilson.

548
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,917
Veer off to Lorraine and Bushton.

549
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:55,503
And we could veer
off to Hoisington.

550
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,798
We'll just have to keep
on veering, that's all.

551
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:03,610
I'm getting hungry.
You getting hungry?

552
00:29:03,611 --> 00:29:04,611
Huh.

Don't you tell me that. Ooh.

558
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,390
Sometimes I just don't know,
with all the old doodly-doo.

559
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,768
Doodly-doo, doodly-doo.

560
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:56,064
Ok, now, you go on back, now.
I'll see you another time.

561
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,942
- Don't send me back.
- Oh, you got to go on back.

562
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,342
I'll see you another
time, I promise.

563
00:30:00,343 --> 00:30:01,514
I want to go in your place.

564
00:30:01,515 --> 00:30:02,878
No, no.

565
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,470
You trying to keep
secrets from me?

566
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,451
You got diamonds and
rubies in there?

567
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,411
Go on, go on.

568
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:13,039
Oh, Fido... Night-night, old Fido.

569
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,124
- Woof-woof.
- Woof-woof.

570
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,421
Woof-woof.

- Much obliged.
- Thank you, sir.

575
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,016
All right, boy, you're next.

576
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,852
I ain't a boy.

577
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:27,525
- Aw, don't let it bother you.
- It ain't funny.

578
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,610
No reason to get that sore.

579
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,195
He called me a boy, didn't he?

580
00:33:31,196 --> 00:33:32,905
He just got mixed up, that's all.

581
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,949
He did not. He looked
me straight in the eye.

582
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:37,345
Yeah, well, I'm looking
you straight in

583
00:33:37,346 --> 00:33:39,579
the eye, and I think
you're beautiful.

584
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,581
- Oh, you're just saying that.
- Would I make that up?

585
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,097
You're as beautiful
as your mama, and she

586
00:33:43,098 --> 00:33:44,542
put all the flowers in
the world to shame.

587
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,123
You know, they wouldn't
even let her come

588
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:47,670
to Holland for fear
she'd droop the tulips,

589
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,630
and you got all the good
looks she ever had.

590
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:51,674
Then how come that
man called me a boy?

591
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,676
I don't know, maybe it's...

592
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,928
Maybe it's because of what
you got on, or something.

593
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,264
What's wrong with what I got on?

594
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,029
Oh, nothing wrong with it, just...

595
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,934
don't exactly make
you look feminine.

596
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:05,063
Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea
we get you fixed up a little bit,

597
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:08,149
get you a new dress, a fancy
new hat, or something.

598
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:11,319
Come to think of it, it wouldn't
exactly hurt business, either.

599
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,654
You really think I'm
as pretty as my mama?

600
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,406
Of course I do.

601
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,748
How much money we got in the box?

602
00:34:17,749 --> 00:34:18,749
$405.16.

603
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:19,827
Give me a $20.

604
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:22,371
- What for?
- Give me a $20.

605
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,126
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

606
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,961
We're going to get us
some fancy new outfits

607
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,630
with this money you got
from your Aunt Helen.

608
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:33,257
- I don't have no Aunt Helen.
- Oh, sure you do, honey.

609
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,468
Come on, let me explain it to you.

610
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:38,679
Yes, sir?

611
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:41,641
I'd like an Ipana toothpaste
and a pack of Sen-Sen.

612
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,477
- Twenty and five.
- Twenty-five.

613
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,104
- Yes, sir.
- Here you go.

614
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,237
75 makes one,

615
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,114
four makes five, and 15 makes 20.

616
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,491
Thank you very much.
I don't need a bag.

617
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,546
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you. Bye now.

618
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,422
Hello. How much is this?

619
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,091
That'll be 35 cents.

620
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,468
65 cents makes a dollar.
Thank you very much.

621
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:18,761
Thank you.

622
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,096
Yes?

623
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,974
May I have a bottle of
purple toilet water, please?

624
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,394
That'll be 25 cents.

625
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,321
There you go.

626
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,413
Lady, you made a mistake.

627
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:48,624
Huh? I give you $4.75.

628
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:50,626
But I gave you a $20 bill.

629
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,628
You give me a $5.

630
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,922
No, madam, it was a $20 bill.

631
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:59,218
You give me a $5, and
I give you $4.75.

632
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,514
It was a $20 bill.

633
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:09,061
Got no $20s in with no $5s.

634
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,105
What's all the turmoil?
What's going on here?

635
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,858
This little girl give me a $5
bill, and I give her change.

636
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:16,235
I gave her a $20
bill, I know I did.

637
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,197
It was a birthday present from
my Aunt Helen in Wichita,

638
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:21,490
and she wrote "Happy Birthday,
Addie" on the end of it.

639
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,659
You just go look and see.

640
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:26,954
That's it right there.

641
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:30,416
That's my $20 bill I got from
my Aunt Helen in Wichita.

642
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:33,002
- Give the child her $20 bill.
- I'm giving it.

643
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:35,305
Give the child her $20
bill, Miss Brownwell.

644
00:36:35,306 --> 00:36:36,322
Yes, sir.

645
00:36:36,323 --> 00:36:38,174
- And give her a piece of candy.
- Yes, sir.

646
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,953
And pay attention to
things, Miss Brownwell.

647
00:36:40,954 --> 00:36:41,954
Yes, sir.

648
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:49,393
Come on in, get your cotton candy.

649
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:52,772
Sweetheart, Cotton Candy.

650
00:36:53,274 --> 00:36:54,274
Five cents.

651
00:36:54,275 --> 00:36:56,234
Do you have change for this five?

652
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,069
There you are, little girl.

653
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,904
Cotton candy, get
your cotton candy.

654
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,240
Mister, this purse is sure full.

655
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:04,200
If you give me the five back,
I'll give you five ones.

656
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:07,161
Cotton candy, get your
cotton candy right here.

657
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,288
Mister, if you got
a ten dollar bill

658
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,666
I'll give you the five back
with the five ones you have.

659
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,542
Would you give me a
ten dollar bill?

660
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:18,005
There, now don't bother me
any more, you understand?

661
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,382
Cotton candy.

662
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:22,051
Step up and get your cotton candy.

663
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:24,220
Come and get it.

664
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:40,111
Get your tickets. Only
one fourth of a dollar.

665
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,363
The show goes on in five minutes.

666
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:46,701
Six unusual little ladies
unveiling the secrets of passion.

667
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,536
Found only a few years back

668
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:51,622
in the actual Egyptian
tomb of Queen Nefereti.

669
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:55,918
And featuring the luscious
Miss Trixie Delight.

670
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,714
- I had my photo took, Moze.
- You did, huh? Ain't that fine.

671
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,549
Moze, can you come have
your photo took with me?

672
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:03,592
- Can't right now, sweetheart.
- Only take a minute.

673
00:38:03,633 --> 00:38:04,633
Not now, you hear me?

674
00:38:04,634 --> 00:38:06,178
But it's almost down here tonight.

675
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,014
- It wouldn't be here after...
- I can't help that.

676
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,156
Now excuse me, you understand?

677
00:38:09,157 --> 00:38:10,420
How many times you
going to see it?

678
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,476
As many times as I like,
that's how many times.

679
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:13,651
You seen it half a dozen times.

680
00:38:13,652 --> 00:38:14,981
And I might see it
a half dozen more.

681
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,647
Now why don't you go
play bingo or something?

682
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,065
I don't want to play bingo.

683
00:38:18,138 --> 00:38:19,239
Well, then why don't you go write

684
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,437
another love note
to St. Roosevelt?

685
00:38:20,438 --> 00:38:21,485
Maybe I will.

686
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,854
And stop standing
around here checking

687
00:38:22,855 --> 00:38:23,891
on me. You don't have to worry.

688
00:38:23,996 --> 00:38:25,324
I ain't about to leave
some poor little

689
00:38:25,325 --> 00:38:26,685
child stranded in the
middle of nowhere.

690
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:29,201
I got scruples, too, you know. You
know what that is, "scruples?"

691
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,703
No, I don't know what it is,

692
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,664
but if you got them, I sure bet
they belong to somebody else.

693
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,502
And his name ain't
Frank, it's Franklin.

694
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:54,727
Hey there, my little turtle-dee.
I wondered where you got to.

695
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:55,853
Where's your pa?

696
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,813
- Is my picture ready?
- Sure, it's...

697
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,148
Excuse me, folks, come right back.

698
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:01,317
Sit back in the moon there,
I'll be right with you.

699
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,651
Let's see.

700
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,153
Here it is, here.

701
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:08,949
Hey, now, I thought you were gonna
sit in the moon with your pa.

702
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,826
He ain't my pa.

703
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,996
Hi, folks. Get ready.

704
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,873
Smile. Hold it.

705
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,041
Hold it.

706
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:18,667
Beautiful.

707
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:37,228
I don't want you smoking
in the car tomorrow.

708
00:39:38,215 --> 00:39:39,215
What?

709
00:39:39,216 --> 00:39:41,732
I didn't say nothing. I'm
just listening to you.

710
00:39:41,817 --> 00:39:42,817
Well, there are going to be a

711
00:39:42,818 --> 00:39:44,068
couple extra people
riding with us,

712
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,940
and this particular person
don't like cigarette smoke.

713
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,488
- What extra person?
- What?

714
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:49,115
I said "what extra person?"

715
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,283
A lady and her maid. I'm
giving them a ride to Topeka.

716
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,701
I didn't know we was
going to Topeka.

717
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,995
Well, that's because you
don't know everything.

718
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:56,789
What's the lady's name?

719
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:59,917
Miss Delight. Miss Trixie Delight.

720
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,045
She's a real lady. She
comes from a good family.

721
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,505
I'm just giving her
a ride, that's all.

722
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,208
Well, that's what
you're always talking

723
00:40:06,209 --> 00:40:07,925
about, ain't it? Helping
other people out.

724
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,236
Now don't you drop
nothing, Imogene.

725
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,071
You take care of those
breakables, understand?

726
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:30,531
Yes, Miss Trixie.

727
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,076
Morning. Car is right over here.

728
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,002
You better ride in the
back-seat a while.

729
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,228
And then I danced in Tuscaloosa.

730
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,019
And the mayor was
there, and he just

731
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,523
said the nicest things about me.

732
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,692
The newspaper ran a
whole big photo on me.

733
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:10,362
I got a scrap book telling stories
on me from towns all over.

734
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,592
Tell him about the time that man

735
00:41:11,692 --> 00:41:14,259
tried to crack your head open
with the bottle, Miss Trixie.

736
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:18,162
Why, Imogene, you silly old
thing. You know that's not true.

737
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,612
That old country boy
wasn't going to

738
00:41:19,613 --> 00:41:20,956
hit me over the head
with no bottle.

739
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:22,416
He was just horsing around.

740
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:25,461
Ask me real nice, maybe I'll
tell you about that sometime.

741
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,063
Well, tell him about the time you

742
00:41:27,064 --> 00:41:28,923
almost got thrown in
jail, Miss Trixie.

743
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,852
I just don't understand it, Daddy,

744
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:45,272
but this little baby has to
go winky-tinky all the time.

745
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:46,725
Well, don't you worry
none. We'll just

746
00:41:46,726 --> 00:41:47,900
plan on stopping here for dinner.

747
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,694
But we just stopped for her
to winky-tink at lunch.

748
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:53,280
That's right, and now we're
stopping for dinner.

749
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:55,699
- Come on.
- I ain't hungry.

750
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,254
- Want one?
- Ok.

751
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,594
- How old are you?
- I don't know, 15. Why?

752
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,555
Just asking, that's all.

753
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,431
- Where are you from?
- Nowhere.

754
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,767
Well, you got to
be from somewhere.

755
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,352
Down by Troy, I guess.

756
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,938
How long have you worked for her?

757
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,523
Ain't kept count.

758
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,817
A year, maybe. How old you be?

759
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,569
Nine.

760
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,988
She really do all that dancing?

761
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,532
Well, if you want to
call it "dancing".

762
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:40,244
All she do is wag her hips and
shake her old behind a little.

763
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:42,705
How come she'd leave
that job back there?

764
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:46,000
Because the boss man tried to
make her put out for his friends.

765
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,460
And she don't believe in
putting out for free.

766
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,878
She put out much?

767
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,630
Just like a gum machine.

768
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,258
You drop something in and
she'll put something out.

769
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,010
How much she charge?

770
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,886
Most she can get.

771
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,097
But she always asks for $5.00.

772
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:01,932
She ain't putting out
for your pa, though.

773
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,445
Says she's going to
wait and get all

774
00:43:04,446 --> 00:43:05,894
she can before she
put out for him.

775
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,896
He tell her he was my pa?

776
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,898
Well, not exactly.

777
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,472
I heard him mumbling
something like

778
00:43:11,473 --> 00:43:12,818
he didn't want to talk about it.

779
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,154
- Ain't he?
- I'm with him, ain't I?

780
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:18,032
And how do you come
to be with her?

781
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,701
Because she promised to
give me $4.00 every week.

782
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,661
She ain't gave me nothing.

783
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,788
Except a nickel or
dime, sometimes.

784
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:27,082
- Why don't you quit?
- Quit?

785
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:29,043
How am I going to quit?

786
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,753
And what if I do quit?

787
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:32,921
Ain't got no money
to get home to Mum.

788
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,381
And what if I do get home?

789
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,508
They got hard times as it is.

790
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,428
My mama say, "You go
work for a white lady,

791
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,764
"she'll take good care of you."

792
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,932
- You want to know what I think?
- Yeah.

793
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,018
You know the little white speck
on top of chicken doo-doo?

794
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:47,144
Yeah.

795
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,647
Well, that's the kind of white
I think Miss Trixie is.

796
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:53,609
She's just like that little white
speck on top of old chicken shit.

797
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,534
Oh, I just love it, love it,
love it. All this white.

798
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,917
It is absolutely the
proper thing for

799
00:44:04,918 --> 00:44:06,955
my particular kind of appearance.

800
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,208
You know, it wouldn't be bad for
you to have a new dress, too.

801
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,877
The right kind of dress makes
all the difference in the face.

802
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:15,089
Especially since you got the
right kind of bone structure.

803
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,799
Oh...

804
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,634
Oh, my, oh, my.

805
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:21,120
Daddy, but wouldn't you
look handsome sitting

806
00:44:21,121 --> 00:44:23,138
behind the wheel of
a thing like that?

807
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:25,391
Course, you know, everything
is in the bone structure.

808
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,348
You know, a person
can tell his whole

809
00:44:27,349 --> 00:44:29,103
life on what his
bone structure is.

810
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,313
I tried pushing her out a
window once in Little Rock.

811
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:33,816
Oh...

812
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:36,235
Oh, I think there's
bugs all over the...

813
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,821
I just hope there's no
snakes around here.

814
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:41,031
You know, I think
we ought to go now.

815
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:43,701
Thank you so much.

816
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,661
Now hurry... oh.

817
00:44:47,497 --> 00:44:49,748
Come on, hurry up. Get those
things in there, now.

818
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,709
Don't break anything, either.

819
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:57,923
Let's go.

820
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,426
Hurry up, doctor, this baby's
got to go winky-tinky.

821
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,802
Don't worry.

822
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,221
Hey.

823
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,852
Come on, we're ready.

824
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,646
- Come on, now.
- I ain't ready.

825
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:14,072
Well, you don't
look real busy with

826
00:45:14,073 --> 00:45:15,357
nothing, so you just come on down.

827
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:16,984
I ain't coming.

828
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:20,070
- Now you listen here, child.
- No, I won't listen here.

829
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,405
What the heck's up with you, then?

830
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,490
I want to sit in front.

831
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:25,534
And how come we ain't
working no more?

832
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:28,036
Because we're on
vacation, that's why.

833
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,844
And Miss Delight and
me are sitting in

834
00:45:29,845 --> 00:45:31,415
front because we
are two grown-ups,

835
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,667
and that's where grown-ups
do the sitting.

836
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,502
And little children
do not tell grown-ups

837
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:37,337
what to do with their
lives, you understand that?

838
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,514
Well, she ain't my
grown-up, and I ain't

839
00:45:39,515 --> 00:45:41,383
planning no more to
sit in the back.

840
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:42,718
Not for no cow.

841
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,344
Will you keep your voice down?

842
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,889
And Miss Delight ain't no
cow. She's a proper woman.

843
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,432
She has a high school diploma,

844
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:50,350
and right now she's gotta
go to the bathroom,

845
00:45:50,351 --> 00:45:51,769
so you just get on
down to the car.

846
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,812
She always has to
go to the bathroom.

847
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,356
She must have a bladder
the size of a peanut.

848
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:59,610
Well, I ain't getting back in that
car. Not till she gets out of it.

849
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:36,647
Hey, what's up, kiddo? Daddy
says you're wearing a sad face.

850
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:38,315
Ain't good to have a sad face.

851
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,052
Hey, how would you
like a colouring

852
00:46:40,053 --> 00:46:41,276
book? Would you like that?

853
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:42,861
You like Mickey the Mouse?

854
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,780
Oh, son of a bitch.

855
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,783
Ooh... oh.

856
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:52,162
Now come on down to the car
and let's all be friends.

857
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:55,040
You see me smile? Come on, let's
see you smile like Aunt Trixie.

858
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,250
Now, come on.

859
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,710
Come on down to the car
with mademoiselle.

860
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,134
Kiddo, I understand how you feel.

861
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,136
Well, you don't have to worry.

862
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:11,056
One of these days, you're going to
be just as pretty as mademoiselle,

863
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:12,933
maybe prettier.

864
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:15,060
You already got bone structure.

865
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:17,563
When I was your age, I didn't
have no bone structure.

866
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,606
Took me years to get
bone structure.

867
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:22,442
And don't think bone
structure's not important.

868
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:25,112
Nobody started to call me
mademoiselle till I was 17

869
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:27,614
and getting a little
bone structure.

870
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:29,867
When I was your age, I was
skinnier than a pole.

871
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:32,035
I never thought I'd
have nothing up here.

872
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:34,538
You're going to have
them up there, too.

873
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,917
Look, I'll tell you what. Want me
to show you how to use cosmetics?

874
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,268
Look, I'll let you put
on my earrings. You

875
00:47:42,269 --> 00:47:43,964
can see how pretty
you're going to be.

876
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:47,092
And I'll show you how
to make up your eyes.

877
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,886
And your lips.

878
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,263
And I'll see to it you get
a little bra or something.

879
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,849
But right now you're gonna
pick your little ass up,

880
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,186
you're gonna drop
it in the back-seat

881
00:47:55,187 --> 00:47:56,321
and you're gonna cut out the crap,

882
00:47:56,322 --> 00:47:57,801
you understand?

883
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:12,117
You're going to
ruin it, ain't you?

884
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:15,495
Look, I don't want
to wipe you out,

885
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:18,248
and I don't want you
wiping me out, you know?

886
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:20,459
So, I'm going to
level with you, ok?

887
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:24,087
Now, you see, with me, it's
just a matter of time.

888
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:26,929
I don't know why,
but somehow I just

889
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:28,926
don't manage to hold on real long.

890
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:32,846
So, if you wait it out a little,
it'll be over, you know?

891
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:36,266
I mean, even if I want a fella,

892
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:39,478
somehow or other I manage
to get it screwed up.

893
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:44,816
Maybe I'll get a new pair of
shoes, nice dress, a few laughs.

894
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,611
Times are hard.

895
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:51,531
Now, if you fool around
on the hill up here,

896
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:53,158
then you don't get nothing,

897
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,618
I don't get nothing,

898
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,328
he don't get nothing.

899
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:00,374
So how about it, honey?

900
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,542
Just for a little while,

901
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:05,837
let old Trixie sit up
front with her big tits.

902
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,433
Hey, come on.

903
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:22,270
We're coming, baby doll.

904
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:25,107
And if you don't find me
some old gas station soon,

905
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:28,235
this little old snowflake's
going to wet her pantaloons.

906
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,656
Oh, my, I almost fell down.

907
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:43,208
Yoo-hoo. Look what we got.

908
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:45,252
Ain't she the sweetest
little thing,

909
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:47,671
and don't he look like a
prince on that wheel?

910
00:49:47,776 --> 00:49:49,965
Now, come on, Imogene. Now,
get everything in here.

911
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,092
We got more room than the
whole state of Kansas.

912
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:55,288
And listen to the horn.
Blow the horn, Daddy.

913
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:58,432
Oh, go ahead.

914
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:01,209
Do it again.

915
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:06,106
Sticks his tongue into the water,

916
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:08,525
and there's an alligator
in the river...

917
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:13,530
Very funny.

918
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,764
This girl's sitting
on the trolley,

919
00:50:16,765 --> 00:50:17,868
and she reaches in her bag,

920
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:20,120
and she takes out this magazine,
and she starts to read it.

921
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:21,830
Well, she ain't read more
than a couple of pages.

922
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:25,083
And real slow and careful now,
she takes her stockings down

923
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,294
and takes off her shoes.

924
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,669
Now, she turns the stockings wrong

925
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:30,088
side out, and she
puts them back on.

926
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,423
She puts her shoes back on.

927
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:32,975
Well, all the passengers
are watching.

928
00:50:32,976 --> 00:50:34,051
They wonder what's going on.

929
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,627
This old guy, he
leans over to her,

930
00:50:35,628 --> 00:50:37,179
and he asks her, he
says, "What's...?

931
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,567
"I saw you indulge in a strange

932
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:40,265
procedure, madam.
What were you doing?"

933
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,768
And she said, "Well, I was reading
this here magazine, you know?

934
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,062
"And I found it to be
such hot stuff that I...

935
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:48,725
"Well, I felt compelled to
turn the hose on myself."

936
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:53,403
Oh, turn the hose on.

937
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:55,614
When you said that, I...

938
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:08,043
They wouldn't have a room with
a canopy bed, would they?

939
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,463
You wouldn't have a room with
a canopy bed, would you?

940
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:14,424
No. But I got one
with a fireplace.

941
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:16,384
Oh, I'd like that one, Daddy.

942
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:19,179
It ain't no canopy bed,

943
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:22,974
but it sure do open up a whole
new can of peas, don't it?

944
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,143
Can of peas.

945
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,687
- Ain't that cute?
- Huh? How's that?

946
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:30,899
Come on, Imogene. Now, help
the boy with these things.

947
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:34,152
Give them 234, 235, and 236.

948
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,623
They're working on the
elevator right now,

949
00:51:36,723 --> 00:51:38,704
and it's the first flight
up, if you don't mind.

950
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,867
- It's all right. Thank you.
- Thank you.

951
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,354
"Can of peas". Did you hear that?

952
00:51:42,355 --> 00:51:43,620
Yeah, what was that all about?

953
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:45,163
Well, you know,

954
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:48,083
Canopy... can of pea...
They rhyme, you know?

955
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:50,669
- Oh, I see. Can of peas, canopy.
- Yeah.

956
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,045
I get it now.

957
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:56,758
I knew you'd get it if
I explained it to you.

Now there's a rip in the
seam of that dress, Imogene.

967
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,737
You get it sewed
up good, you hear?

968
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:01,239
- And wash these hose.
- Yes, Miss Trixie.

969
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:03,617
- Got my bath ready?
- Yes, Miss Trixie.

970
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:04,910
Hope the water's not too hot.

971
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,953
You've been making that water
awful hot lately, Imogene.

972
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,955
I knows you like it
hot, Miss Trixie.

973
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,665
Well, not that hot.

974
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,424
Now, you go on, finish
up all these things

975
00:53:12,425 --> 00:53:14,002
and come back in an
hour and dry me off.

976
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:15,962
Yes, Miss Trixie.

977
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:23,720
What you doing up there?

978
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:26,223
I got us an idea. Come on.

979
00:53:26,697 --> 00:53:27,697
What kind of idea?

980
00:53:27,698 --> 00:53:29,392
Come on in here,
and I'll tell you.

981
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:31,186
Go on.

982
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,607
Imogene, what do you suppose
Miss Trixie would do

983
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:38,193
if somebody offered
her $25 to put out?

984
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:39,694
Oh-wee, you crazy.

985
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:42,072
For that much money, that woman
would drop her pants down

986
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,157
- in the middle of the road.
- That's what I figured.

987
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:45,367
What you got in mind?

988
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,869
You want to get away from
Miss Trixie, don't you?

989
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:49,365
Well, if you help
me, I'll give you

990
00:53:49,366 --> 00:53:50,872
enough money to get
home to your mama.

991
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:53,458
- How much money?
- $30.

992
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:55,877
- When do we start?
- Tomorrow morning.

993
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:01,341
Miss Trixie,

994
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:04,636
you know that man down at the
desk who checked us in yesterday?

995
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,346
Yeah, I know him. What about him?

996
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:10,058
Well, he tell me, he'd pay $25
just to have a good time with you.

997
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,309
What?

998
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,853
Well, that little two-bit
bum nerve of that guy.

999
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:16,773
$25. I bet that little John
don't make that much in a week.

1000
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:18,191
Where would he get 25 bucks?

1001
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:21,278
I don't know. All I know
is what he told me.

1002
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,989
25 bucks, huh?

1003
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,782
Sure have to see the
money to believe it.

1004
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:40,171
Here you go. You come back
and see us again real soon.

1005
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:46,344
I'll have a Juicy
Fruit gum, please.

1006
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:49,139
Here you go, my little beauty.
Want I should chew it for you?

1007
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:51,266
Say, you know that red-headed lady

1008
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,643
that comes down here named
Miss Trixie Delight?

1009
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:55,603
Well, she thinks you're real cute.

1010
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,564
Oh, yeah? Says you and who else?

1011
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:00,442
No, honest. She says you're
better looking than Dick Powell.

1012
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:03,111
She did? Well, the lady's
got good taste, don't she?

1013
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:04,993
Well, just thought
you'd like to know.

1014
00:55:04,994 --> 00:55:05,994
Hey, just a minute.

1015
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:10,066
Give these here to
the lady, and tell

1016
00:55:10,067 --> 00:55:11,953
her they're with
Floyd's compliments.

1017
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,790
Oh. She'll like that.

1018
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,584
Maybe you should write her a note.

1019
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:20,086
- Yeah. What kind of a note?
- Oh, I don't know.

1020
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:21,754
I thought men always wrote ladies

1021
00:55:21,755 --> 00:55:23,506
notes when they
send them presents.

1022
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:25,425
Maybe you should ask
her for a date.

1023
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,093
That will sure tickle her.

1024
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,928
Yeah. Maybe I ought to.

1025
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:32,140
Say, she's not married up or
anything like that, is she?

1026
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:36,728
Of course not. She don't even
have a regular boyfriend.

1027
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,689
That man who come in here
yesterday with her is my daddy.

1028
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:41,858
He's her manager. She's a dancer.

1029
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:43,276
A dancer?

1030
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:45,653
You know, I figured she
was something like that.

1031
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:46,780
Whereabouts she dance?

1032
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:49,282
Oh, lots of big
places. She's a star.

1033
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:50,867
Well, how about that.

1034
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:53,536
Why don't you print it?
She like men who prints.

1035
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,705
Print it, huh?

1036
00:55:57,145 --> 00:56:00,293
"Some sweets for
the sweet. Ha, ha.

1037
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:03,254
"Some girls say I'm a pretty
smooth dancer myself.

1038
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,889
"How about trying
me out sometime?"

1039
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:06,257
You sure this is going to work?

1040
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:09,260
I don't know, but we're sure
going to give it a try.

1041
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:21,606
Throw this in the
drawer, will you?

1042
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,984
And keep your fingers crossed.

1043
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:33,410
- Who is it?
- It's me, Addie.

1044
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:35,245
Oh. What do you want?

1045
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,996
I got a message from Moze.

1046
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:39,666
He asked me to tell you he had to
run over to Hainesville today.

1047
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,835
He won't be back until suppertime.

1048
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,672
I think he had to get
something fixed on his car.

1049
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:48,591
- He'll be gone all day.
- Oh.

1050
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:50,802
Well... ok.

1051
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:58,560
Ok.

1052
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:12,240
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

1053
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:14,701
- What you having?
- Waffles.

1054
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:16,703
I already ate. I had waffles, too.

1055
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,955
They sure are good, ain't they?

1056
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,082
They ain't bad for waffles.

1057
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:25,128
Mr Moze, Miss Trixie
don't feel so good.

1058
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,046
She say she's going
to stay in bed today.

1059
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:29,090
She say she'll see you
around suppertime.

1060
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:31,176
She sick? Sick in bed?
I better go up there.

1061
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,928
Oh, she ain't real sick. Ain't
nothing to worry about.

1062
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,680
She's just having her lady's time.

1063
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:39,017
Oh.

1064
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,852
Well, you tell her I'll
see her this evening.

1065
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:47,775
Well, just wanted to
say good morning.

1066
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:50,320
I think I'll go upstairs
and polish my shoes.

1067
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:36,533
- Somebody at the door, Imogene.
- Yes, Miss Trixie.

1068
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,834
It's something for
you, Miss Trixie.

1069
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,546
- Oh, what is it?
- It was outside the door.

1070
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:51,464
What is that?

1071
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:56,094
Imogene, let all that go now.

1072
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:58,429
You can run along. I'll
call you when I need you.

1073
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:00,557
Yes, Miss Trixie.

1074
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:11,359
Well, hello, cupid.

1075
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:13,223
Miss Trixie wants to see you. She

1076
00:59:13,224 --> 00:59:15,196
says it's real
important. Room 235.

1077
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:17,574
Oh, she does, does she? When?

1078
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:20,159
- Right now.
- Well, I can't get off right now.

1079
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,953
But she says it's real important.

1080
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:24,050
Well, you tell her
I'll come up later

1081
00:59:24,051 --> 00:59:25,832
tonight... when the moon is full.

1082
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:27,458
But you can't come tonight.

1083
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:29,836
She won't even be
here after tonight.

1084
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:32,714
Matter of fact, she won't
even be here after today.

1085
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:35,258
She won't, huh? Well...

1086
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:37,844
You won't be sorry.

1087
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:41,514
I guess I could go up
for a few minutes.

1088
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:42,849
What's that room number again?

1089
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:45,852
Room 235. She's waiting for ya.

1090
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:49,272
Ok. You tell her I'm on
my way up, sweetheart.

1091
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:57,822
He's coming. He's coming.

1092
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:13,338
- Who is it?
- Sheik of Araby.

1093
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:18,009
Well, then, don't you look pretty?

1094
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,927
Well, come on in, honey.

1095
01:00:23,895 --> 01:00:25,892
Come on.

1096
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:30,146
You don't give a girl much time.

1097
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:31,981
Oh, I manage to get around.

1098
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:33,372
Say, you're not one
of these fellows

1099
01:00:33,373 --> 01:00:34,692
goes around babbling,
are you, honey?

1100
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:35,818
What do you mean?

1101
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:37,557
Well, you know, now most
of the time I don't mind,

1102
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:39,947
but it's important to me right
now not to get talked about.

1103
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:42,533
Hey, now do I look like
that kind of fellow?

1104
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:45,620
Say... oh, say you are a
wild one, aren't you?

1105
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:48,623
Hold it, hold it. Now, wait a
minute, you're going to tear it.

1106
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:50,875
Now, now, just let me slip it off.

1107
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,168
Hey, there.

1108
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:54,420
Well, now, ain't you a show dog?

1109
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:56,506
Ooh... ooh.

1110
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,424
I'm going.

1111
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:03,346
The key... Give me the key.

1112
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:05,007
Mr Moze's going to
kill that man. He's

1113
01:01:05,008 --> 01:01:06,683
going to kill them
both, I just knows it.

1114
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:12,730
- Wait for me here.
- Ok.

1115
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:36,587
- Moze.
- What's the trouble?

1116
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:39,799
Better go up to Trixie's
room right away.

1117
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:41,092
Why? What? She sick?

1118
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:42,802
No, she's not sick. Just
do what I tell you.

1119
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:45,138
And take the elevator.

1120
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:47,515
Don't knock. Use the key.

1121
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,785
Your daddy going to kill
that man, I reckon.

1122
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,996
I expect he cut him up pretty bad.

1123
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:11,873
Moze wouldn't do a
thing like that.

1124
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:14,500
Well, down home, when a
man come in from work,

1125
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:17,378
and hear a man inside house
in bed with his wife,

1126
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:19,547
he just walk around
to the woodpile

1127
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:21,629
and get his double-blade
axe, and go

1128
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:23,926
inside, chop 'em both
up to little pieces.

1129
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:27,138
Folks say he cut 'em up
just like kindling wood.

1130
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:42,111
Get your things,
Addie. We're leaving.

1131
01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:44,363
- Now?
- Right this minute.

1132
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:06,427
I swan, I don't know why that
girl did such a thing to me.

1133
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,430
I'd have done almost
anything for that girl.

1134
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:11,474
Just ain't fair.

1135
01:03:15,249 --> 01:03:18,314
I reckon she's been...
carrying on a long time.

1136
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:20,775
- From the start.
- You mean, there were other men?

1137
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,151
Lots of 'em.

1138
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:24,237
Well, dadblammit, why
didn't you tell me?

1139
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:26,781
I just knew you
wouldn't believe me.

1140
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,300
I want you to promise
me just one thing.

1141
01:03:30,301 --> 01:03:31,301
What, Moze?

1142
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:35,289
When you grow up, don't
you be the kind of woman

1143
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:37,667
who goes around deceiving men.

1144
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:40,670
- Promise me that.
- I promise, Moze.

Moze, pay attention.

1155
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:45,610
- What's the trouble?
- I seen something peculiar.

1156
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,820
- What's that?
- That man in there.

1157
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:51,490
- What man?
- Standing by the door.

1158
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:53,075
What's peculiar about him?

1159
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:55,953
He's got a roll of money could
choke us both to death.

1160
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:59,165
Well, I'm not up to
anything right now.

1161
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:00,985
But he's got a black
book for making

1162
01:05:00,986 --> 01:05:02,376
notes in, and all that money,

1163
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:05,504
and he keeps going outside and
then coming back in again.

1164
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:07,798
- Bootlegger.
- Bootlegger?

1165
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,300
No question about it.

1166
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:11,302
You think we might do
some business with him?

1167
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:12,929
Maybe drop a wad or something?

1168
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:15,556
We ain't done nothing in two
months, ever since Trixie.

1169
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:17,808
And we only have $212 left.

1170
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,769
Better ways of doing
business with bootleggers.

1171
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,020
What ways?

1172
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:22,813
Oh, heaps of ways.

1173
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:24,982
Look, he's going out again.

1174
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:27,693

He's got a lot of bottles he keeps
in some kind of bin out back.

1188
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:10,567
How big's the bin?

1189
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:11,922
About as big as our
car trunk, maybe.

Find out where he keeps his goods.

1192
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:15,695
Well, there was a little shack out

1193
01:07:15,696 --> 01:07:17,053
there, too, but he
didn't go in it.

1194

He's a bootlegger, all right.

of a big shot, too,

1200
01:07:34,896 --> 01:07:36,655
but the girl couldn't
tell me about him.

1201
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:39,366
Some Romeo walked up, and I had
to beat it. Now, where is it?

1202

- Right over there.
- Ok, come on.

Ok, now, you watch the hotel.

Well, maybe you ought
to get acquainted.

1219
01:09:00,886 --> 01:09:03,200
He's running the biggest
wholesale business in the state.

1220
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:05,161
- You selling?
- That's right.

01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:07,079
Ain't interested in no shiney.

1222
01:09:07,184 --> 01:09:10,124
I ain't selling no shiney, I
only deal in bonded goods.

1223
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:11,876
- What kind?
- All kinds.

1224
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:14,295
I can let you have a pretty good
deal on some Three Feathers.

How much?

1226
01:09:15,776 --> 01:09:17,563
Well, it depends. You take 20

cases, I'll let 'em
go for $25 per.

1228
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:21,385
- That's too much.
- Ain't too much.

1229
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:24,054
You can't get it that cheap
where they sell it legal.

1230
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,764
Ain't legal here.

1231
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:27,892
That's all the more reason
you're getting a bargain.

1232
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:29,560
Give you just $20.

1233
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:32,146
Can't do it. Price is
set down in Wichita.

1234
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:35,524

01:10:23,928 --> 01:10:25,658
Now hold on.

1251
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:27,660

1252
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:29,161
Well, you'd better go slow.

1253
01:10:29,266 --> 01:10:30,829

1254
01:10:34,291 --> 01:10:35,291
Easy.

1255
01:10:35,292 --> 01:10:37,878
Well, I got to turn
corners, don't I?

1256
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:44,260
Moze, ain't he going
to miss his whisky?

1257
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:45,678
Oh, maybe in about a week,

1258
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:47,846
but by the time he's figured
it out, we'll be in Missouri

1259
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:50,599
and he can't do nothing
once we're in Missouri.

1260
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,272
Come on.

1261
01:11:14,436 --> 01:11:16,292
Where is it?

1262
01:11:40,337 --> 01:11:41,942
Scoot over.

1263
01:11:43,882 --> 01:11:46,447
- How much you get?
- $625.

1264
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:50,316
$625, and he bought
his own whisky.

1265
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:14,433
That's $625 plus the
$212 we already got.

1266
01:12:14,538 --> 01:12:17,186
And if we drop some wallets
and do some 20s, we'll...

1267
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:19,605
- What's that?
- Where?

1268
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:20,939
Behind us.

1269
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:23,400
I don't see nothing.

1270
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:26,653
- There's something back there.
- Nothing but pitch black.

1271
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:28,560
I thought I seen
something flicker.

1272
01:12:28,561 --> 01:12:29,561
Nothing there.

1273
01:12:31,388 --> 01:12:33,786
- You put the money in the box?
- Huh.

1274
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:36,455
I'll be glad to get out of
this town, I'll tell you that.

1275
01:12:39,396 --> 01:12:41,085
There it is again.

1276
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,628
Dadblammit.

1277
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:44,713
Something flickered, sure as hell.

1278
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:46,840
Nothing behind us, Moze.

1279
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:51,762
- Oh.
- I told ya.

1280
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:57,184
- Who could it be?
- Christ.

1281
01:13:05,422 --> 01:13:07,277
- Don't stop, keep going.
- I can't keep going.

1282
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:09,279
The damn car's in front of me.

1283
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:10,764
Everything's going
to be all right.

1284
01:13:10,765 --> 01:13:11,990
You just let me do the talking.

1285
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:21,405
You playing games with us, Mister?

1286
01:13:21,406 --> 01:13:23,127
Oh, I didn't know
who was back there.

1287
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:26,213
It's a risky thing to do. Might
get your tyres shot off.

1288
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:27,548
Where you heading?

1289
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:30,175
Me and my little girl
are going to Saint Jo.

1290
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,010
- Oh. Live there?
- Nearby.

1291
01:13:34,284 --> 01:13:36,473
What's your business?

1292
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:39,017
Livestock, mostly... mules
and horses. Some cattle.

1293
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:42,938
That's funny. I heard
you was a bootlegger.

1294
01:13:43,043 --> 01:13:45,649
Oh, no, sir, not me, friend.
Must be some mistake.

1295
01:13:46,964 --> 01:13:49,319
Maybe... Maybe not.

1296
01:13:57,015 --> 01:13:59,121
The way I hear it...

1297
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:02,541
you just had a transaction
by the old barn.

1298
01:14:02,646 --> 01:14:04,460
Where'd you hear a
thing like that?

1299
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:06,295
Oh, a... friend of the family.

1300
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:08,797
No, I'm sorry, I...

1301
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:10,361
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1302
01:14:10,362 --> 01:14:11,508
I'm talking about bootlegging.

1303
01:14:12,197 --> 01:14:14,428
I'm talking about $625.

1304
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:16,013
Now, just where might that be?

1305
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:19,266
I don't have no $625. I don't
know what you're talking about.

1306
01:14:19,371 --> 01:14:21,310
I don't even know where
the old barn is.

1307
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:24,188
Well...

1308
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:26,993
I reckon we'll just
have to explain

1309
01:14:26,994 --> 01:14:28,775
a little more
thoroughly, won't we?

1310
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:31,320
Come on, Beau, you take a
ride with these nice people.

1311
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:33,822
- Love to.
- We're all going back to town.

1312
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:49,379
Damn.

1313
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:52,424
Just when you think
you got it made...

1314
01:14:53,405 --> 01:14:55,260
just ain't made, is it?

1315
01:14:57,284 --> 01:14:59,056
You pretty good at
this little thing?

1316
01:14:59,057 --> 01:15:00,057
Not too good.

1317
01:15:00,704 --> 01:15:02,184
Not too good, huh?

1318
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:04,895
Old bootlegger's sitting there
with his own little game,

1319
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,523
and he ain't even
good at his own game.

1320
01:15:09,296 --> 01:15:12,444
Yes, sir, that is some good joke.

1321
01:15:16,428 --> 01:15:18,575
I found these on the front seat.

1322
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,995
Wasn't any money in the car. Went
all through it, inside and out.

1323
01:15:22,768 --> 01:15:24,623
Livestock business, huh?

1324
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:27,292
That whisky's for a friend.

1325
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:30,087
Hold out your hands.

1326
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:31,192
Huh?

1327
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:33,173
I said, hold out your
hands. You heard me.

1328
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:45,602
I didn't say put 'em down, did I?

1329
01:15:47,084 --> 01:15:49,565
Mighty clean hands for livestock.

1330
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:51,483
Them hands don't look
like they do nothing much

1331
01:15:51,588 --> 01:15:53,735
except play a little
casino every now and then.

1332
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,907
I told you, that whisky's for a
friend. I didn't see no harm...

1333
01:15:55,908 --> 01:15:57,180
Didn't see no harm?

1334
01:15:58,011 --> 01:16:01,577
Hear that, Beau? Big bootlegger
claims he don't know the law.

1335
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:04,352
Well, Mr Bootlegger, I
don't need no couple

1336
01:16:04,353 --> 01:16:05,831
of bottles to make a
case against you.

1337
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:09,126
Law says all I need is
just one little old drop.

1338
01:16:09,856 --> 01:16:13,422
And... law says you use a vehicle
to transport alcoholic beverages,

1339
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:17,801
and said vehicle is confiscated to
be sold at public auctions, so...

1340
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:20,679
you can just kiss that pretty
little old car of yours goodbye.

1341
01:16:20,784 --> 01:16:22,556
Hey, hold on. That seems
pretty rough just because...

1342
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:25,225
Don't lower your hands. I didn't
tell you to lower your hands.

1343
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:27,269
I tell you to lower your hands,
then you lower your hands.

1344
01:16:27,374 --> 01:16:29,980
You don't do nothing till I
tell you to. Understand?

1345
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:31,565
Answer me. You understand?

1346
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:34,735
Yes, sir.

1347
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:41,908
Ah, I already done that.

1348
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:43,857
Ain't nothing in
his clothes except

1349
01:16:43,858 --> 01:16:45,495
him. He ain't worth five cents.

1350
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:48,582
No, she ain't got
nothing on her, either.

1351
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:52,044
You don't know what kind of
real bad trouble you're in.

1352
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:53,920
You better start thinking on it.

1353
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:55,938
I've got a case against you for

1354
01:16:55,939 --> 01:16:57,424
possession and
transporting whisky,

1355
01:16:57,529 --> 01:17:00,469
and I reckon if I try, I can
think of a few other things.

1356
01:17:02,534 --> 01:17:03,765
Better face it, you're going to be

1357
01:17:03,766 --> 01:17:05,140
up in these parts
for quite a while,

1358
01:17:05,245 --> 01:17:07,225
working on the county roads.

1359
01:17:07,331 --> 01:17:09,603
Maybe you're lucky, you
get out in six months.

1360
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:11,447
Six more months, influencing a

1361
01:17:11,448 --> 01:17:13,649
child, maybe get six
years for that.

1362
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:15,651
Maybe we could work something out.

1363
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:18,278
What's there to work out?

1364
01:17:19,259 --> 01:17:21,031
While I rustle one up,

1365
01:17:21,136 --> 01:17:22,824
'you all listen to
this little goodie

1366
01:17:22,929 --> 01:17:24,284
'from a couple of years ago...'

1367
01:17:27,684 --> 01:17:30,624
Ah, I sure don't like to send a
man to a road gang. Never have.

1368
01:17:30,729 --> 01:17:33,293
Always felt sorry for
them poor devils.

1369
01:17:33,398 --> 01:17:37,381
But I can't overlook the fact
that you've been paid $625,

1370
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:40,133
and you ain't telling
me where it is.

1371
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:41,685
Now, I know you're
a bootlegger, so

1372
01:17:41,686 --> 01:17:43,011
what's there for me to work out?

1373
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:48,475
All right. Let's cut this
ring-around-the-rosy.

1374
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:51,520
Where's that... money?

1375
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:11,498
You think I'm fooling around?

1376
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:14,376
I ain't fooling around.

1377
01:18:22,572 --> 01:18:24,803
Maybe you'll come around in time.

1378
01:18:24,908 --> 01:18:27,514
Get a little thirsty and
get a little hungry.

1379
01:18:27,619 --> 01:18:30,350
Time sure does have a way with
criminals, don't it, Beau?

1380
01:18:30,455 --> 01:18:31,893
Sure do.

1381
01:18:31,998 --> 01:18:33,353
Well, it's getting on to 5:00.

1382
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:35,230
Somebody ought to be
stirring over at the café.

1383
01:18:35,335 --> 01:18:37,274
I think I'll step
over there a while.

1384
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:39,735
See if that friend of
the family's there.

1385
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,445
I'll be on back before long.

1386
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:44,239

I need to go to the shithouse.

Well, there's a place
down the hall.

1402
01:20:05,467 --> 01:20:07,280
Daddy, I'm scared.

stand by the door.

Down there.

1406
01:20:32,452 --> 01:20:35,016
- Run.
- You crazy?

1407
01:20:35,121 --> 01:20:36,184
Hey.

1408
01:20:36,289 --> 01:20:38,937
Where are we running? Oh, my God.

1409
01:20:39,042 --> 01:20:42,190
Stop them people. Hey,
there's bootleggers.

1410
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:45,861
Jesus Christ, this
is the craziest...

1411
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:48,113
- Hurry.
- I'm hurrying.

1412
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:01,167
- Stop.
- Oh, Jesus.

1413
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:07,841
- I'm going to hit him.
- Make him jump. Don't slow down.

1414
01:21:10,031 --> 01:21:12,262
I could have killed him. They're
going to have me up for murder.

1415
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:16,558
- They're shooting at us.
- But they're missing. Keep going.

1416
01:21:25,672 --> 01:21:27,319
- We ain't gonna make it.
- Yes, we will.

1417
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:28,938
Not in this car, we
ain't. Every lawman in

1418
01:21:28,939 --> 01:21:30,488
Kansas is going to be
looking for this car.

1419
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:32,616
We got to get across
the river to Missouri.

1420
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:34,034
Where's the bridge?

1421
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:36,202
- Oh, Jesus.
- What's the matter?

1422
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:38,204
- Damn bridge is the other way.
- What?

1423
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:39,331
Hang on.

1424
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:07,233
Ah, this ain't no good. We're
gonna make it too easy for 'em.

1425
01:22:07,339 --> 01:22:09,569
We got to get off
this road. Hang on.

1426
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:16,952
Holy smoke.

1427
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:19,120
Blow your horn.

1428
01:22:19,225 --> 01:22:22,040
Won't do no good. He
can't pull off the road.

1429
01:22:22,145 --> 01:22:24,918
Ain't we got all the luck, selling
whisky to a sheriff's brother?

1430
01:22:31,446 --> 01:22:32,509
Hang onto your hat.

1431
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:34,010
- What?
- Hold on, I said.

1432
01:22:34,115 --> 01:22:35,345
Oh, God.

1433
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:48,525
- You all right?
- Huh.

1434
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:50,323
Ok, we threw a hobble on 'em for a

1435
01:22:50,324 --> 01:22:51,861
while, but we got to
get off this road,

1436
01:22:51,967 --> 01:22:53,571
or we're going to end
up in a town for sure.

1437
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:56,574
And take that money out of there.
You like to give me heart failure.

1438
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:59,160
We made it, didn't we?

1439
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:54,758
Anybody home?

1440
01:24:03,204 --> 01:24:04,684
Howdy.

1441
01:24:04,789 --> 01:24:06,811
Need to get rid of my car here.

1442
01:24:09,669 --> 01:24:12,150
I need to get rid of my car.

1443
01:24:12,255 --> 01:24:13,809
Sheriff wants to
take away my little

1444
01:24:13,810 --> 01:24:15,111
girl, put her in an orphanage.

1445
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:19,699
You know anybody who
might want to swap?

1446
01:24:22,223 --> 01:24:24,412
How about that truck over there?

1447
01:24:32,442 --> 01:24:34,506
Well, we'll just let him
chew on it a while.

1448
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:41,638
Well, the rear tyres
look new, anyway.

1449
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:59,614
- The radio looks ok.
- Think this thing runs?

1450
01:24:59,719 --> 01:25:01,395
It better. We got to have
some way of travelling.

1451
01:25:01,396 --> 01:25:02,396
Where we going to go?

1452
01:25:02,397 --> 01:25:03,993
Out of Kansas, across
the river to Saint Jo.

1453
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:05,829
That's where.

1454
01:25:08,019 --> 01:25:09,249
Here he comes.

1455
01:25:16,611 --> 01:25:18,133
Look at 'em all.

1456
01:25:34,712 --> 01:25:36,901
All I'm looking for is a swap
and three days' head start

1457
01:25:37,006 --> 01:25:38,319
before you take it
out on the highway.

1458
01:25:42,545 --> 01:25:44,506
It's all legal. Got the papers
right here to prove it.

1459
01:25:44,606 --> 01:25:46,870
Just have to fill out that form
on the back, and you own it.

1460
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:53,376
Ain't gonna swap.

1461
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:55,795
Well, it's brand-new.

1462
01:25:56,651 --> 01:25:58,298
That car ain't no good.

1463
01:25:58,403 --> 01:25:59,674
What's the matter with it?

1464
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:02,385
Can't haul nothing in it.

1465
01:26:02,907 --> 01:26:04,637
Oh, well, if that's all
that's bothering you,

1466
01:26:04,742 --> 01:26:06,931
you can sell the car and get two
trucks to do your hauling in.

1467
01:26:07,704 --> 01:26:09,767
I ain't gonna swap.

1468
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:11,144
Wrassle you for it.

1469
01:26:12,792 --> 01:26:14,355
- Are you crazy?
- If I win, we swap.

1470
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:16,065
You win, you can keep the
car and the truck both.

1471
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,275
- Moze...
- Quiet down.

1472
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:19,736
- What kind of wrassling?
- You name it.

1473
01:26:20,758 --> 01:26:22,697
- Catch as can?
- Shoes or barefoot?

1474
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:26,826
Makes no never mind to me.

1475
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:28,453
Barefoot.

1476
01:26:37,442 --> 01:26:40,298
You're gonna get killed just
to give something away.

1477
01:26:40,403 --> 01:26:42,383
I ain't got no choice.

1478
01:26:43,489 --> 01:26:45,803
Get that city boy.

1479
01:26:45,909 --> 01:26:47,639
Get the city boy.

1480
01:26:51,956 --> 01:26:53,311
Let's go.

1481
01:26:53,416 --> 01:26:55,271
Make him say "calf rope," Leroy.

1482
01:26:59,839 --> 01:27:01,569
Come on, Leroy. Get him, Leroy.

1483
01:27:01,674 --> 01:27:03,404
Get him.

1484
01:27:07,138 --> 01:27:10,203
That ain't fair. You stop that.
You make him fight fair.

1485
01:27:10,808 --> 01:27:13,122
Look out for that rake, Leroy.

1486
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:14,624
Watch out, Leroy.

1487
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:18,670
- Let's go in the car. Come on.
- Yee-haw.

1488
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:22,298
Woo-hoo. Yoo-hoo. Woo-hoo.

1489
01:27:36,542 --> 01:27:39,524
- Are you pushing?
- Of course I'm pushing.

1490
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:46,197
Ok, it'll go now. Put
your foot on the brake.

1491
01:27:49,555 --> 01:27:52,161
- The brake. The brake.
- It don't work.

1492
01:27:55,228 --> 01:27:58,293
The brake, goddamn it. The brake.

1493
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:21,024
Don't you even know where
the damn brake is?

1494
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:22,859
It don't work.

1495
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:24,193
Oh...

1496
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:26,070
Well, it figures.

1497
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:29,240
Well, we're in Missouri anyway.

1498
01:28:29,345 --> 01:28:31,743
What'll we do now, drop some 20s?

1499
01:28:33,725 --> 01:28:37,582
- How much money we got?
- $837 and some change.

1500
01:28:37,687 --> 01:28:39,459
42 cents, I think.

1501
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:41,711
Well, we're just outside
of St. Jo, ain't we?

1502
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:44,088
- So what?
- So...

1503
01:28:45,528 --> 01:28:49,010
It's a big town, ain't it?
We can do better than 20s.

1504
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:54,724
'You all know that one.

01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:56,148

01:29:06,466 --> 01:29:07,653
- Moze?
- Yeah?

1512
01:29:07,759 --> 01:29:09,314
What if that old man
don't believe ya?

1513
01:29:09,315 --> 01:29:10,490
He'll believe me, all right.

1514
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:13,076
He's in the market for making
a killing, just like we are.

1515
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:14,869
Maybe he don't even
have a silver mine.

1516
01:29:14,974 --> 01:29:17,246
I had him checked out real
thorough. Where's the money?

1517
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:20,666
And he's just what people
say he is, rich and greedy.

1518
01:29:22,106 --> 01:29:24,379
'The independent candidate
for Senate this year...'

1519
01:29:24,484 --> 01:29:26,631
- Pull up your socks.
- Moze...

1520
01:29:26,736 --> 01:29:28,098
If we get a silver
mine, we could get

1521
01:29:28,099 --> 01:29:29,425
a house and everything,
couldn't we?

1522
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:32,220

Burlington, 11 o'clock.

Just show there with tears
in your eyes. That's all.

1528
01:29:42,752 --> 01:29:45,149
Moze, don't forget the money.

1529
01:29:46,089 --> 01:29:48,361
Of course I won't
forget the money.

1530
01:29:48,466 --> 01:29:49,654
I'll see you in 30 minutes.

1531
01:29:49,759 --> 01:29:52,198
Moze, could we get a piano, too?

1532
01:29:52,303 --> 01:29:55,118

I guess you just didn't
make a good enough swap.

1536
01:30:35,763 --> 01:30:38,119
My brother's real sore at ya.

1537
01:30:38,224 --> 01:30:40,830
Seems you sold him some
of his own whisky.

1538
01:30:42,103 --> 01:30:44,208
You can't arrest me
now. We're in Missouri.

1539
01:30:44,313 --> 01:30:46,002
And your damn brother's
a bootlegger.

1540
01:30:47,692 --> 01:30:50,047
You got an awful
big mouth, Mister.

1541
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:52,971
Maybe I can't arrest
you in Missouri,

1542
01:30:52,972 --> 01:30:54,469
and maybe I don't want to.

1543
01:30:54,574 --> 01:30:56,815
But I sure can make
sure that you ain't

1544
01:30:56,816 --> 01:30:59,056
gonna feel real good
while you're here.

1545
01:31:06,794 --> 01:31:08,983
Let's go.

1546
01:32:50,314 --> 01:32:52,336
Addie...

1547
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:04,098
Addie...

1548
01:33:10,126 --> 01:33:11,897
Moze.

1549
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:14,358
Moze...

1550
01:33:14,463 --> 01:33:15,735
I sw...

1551
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,403
I swallowed my gold tooth.

1552
01:33:17,508 --> 01:33:19,822
- Aw, Moze.
- They took it all.

1553
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:22,950
- Oh, Moze, you're all beat up.
- Ain't nothing left.

1554
01:33:23,055 --> 01:33:24,822
Don't worry none.
I've been keeping

1555
01:33:24,823 --> 01:33:26,245
ten dollars for emergencies.

1556
01:33:26,350 --> 01:33:28,331
What the hell we do
with ten dollars?

1557
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:31,751
We could buy some bibles,
do a little widow business.

1558
01:33:31,856 --> 01:33:34,629
Must be lots of good
towns around here.

1559
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:37,006
Do some 20s, drop some wallets...

1560
01:33:37,111 --> 01:33:39,383
before you know it, we'll
be real good again.

1561
01:33:39,488 --> 01:33:43,220
I'll bet in no time we could have
a whole new car and everything.

1562
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:55,941
You're going to take me to
Aunt Billie's now, ain't ya?

1563
01:33:59,133 --> 01:34:01,238
- Aw, Moze...
- Don't start crying.

1564
01:34:01,344 --> 01:34:02,344
I won't.

1565
01:34:02,345 --> 01:34:04,116
That's where we set
out for, ain't it?

1566
01:34:21,113 --> 01:34:22,760
Looks nice.

1567
01:34:22,865 --> 01:34:24,512
Yeah, it looks real fine.

1568
01:34:28,454 --> 01:34:31,894
- That must be your uncle Daniel.
- He looks nice, too, don't he?

1569
01:34:31,999 --> 01:34:33,938
Yup. Real nice.

1570
01:34:36,921 --> 01:34:38,317
Maybe if Frank D. Roosevelt comes,

1571
01:34:38,422 --> 01:34:40,486
he'll tell him to take me
to the station to see him.

1572
01:34:40,591 --> 01:34:41,760
Maybe you write, old Frankie'll

1573
01:34:41,761 --> 01:34:43,155
have a place to
write you back now.

1574
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:44,448
Yeah, he might, at that.

1575
01:34:44,553 --> 01:34:47,159
Course he will. Ain't no
question but he will.

1576
01:34:49,183 --> 01:34:51,247
All this talk's just wasting time.

1577
01:35:06,742 --> 01:35:09,890
Here's your... here,
your skates, your radio.

1578
01:35:09,995 --> 01:35:11,892
- Where you gonna go?
- Don't worry about me.

1579
01:35:11,997 --> 01:35:14,353
I got plans. New ideas
coming in every day.

1580
01:35:14,458 --> 01:35:16,105
Get going.

1581
01:35:18,963 --> 01:35:22,153
You know, if I knew for
sure you wasn't my pa...

1582
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:26,615
It's for sure I ain't your pa.

1583
01:35:26,721 --> 01:35:28,705
Although sometimes
I used to figure

1584
01:35:28,706 --> 01:35:30,578
Mr Connors could have been my pa,

1585
01:35:30,683 --> 01:35:33,122
the way he touched
my shoulder, get me

1586
01:35:33,123 --> 01:35:35,624
things from the candy
counter for free.

1587
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:39,378
And Mr Pritchard, he smiled
at me once real nice.

1588
01:35:40,192 --> 01:35:42,590
Except they don't have
my jaw or nothing.

1589
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:46,552
So long.

1590
01:35:46,657 --> 01:35:48,888
Ain't you coming to
the door with me?

1591
01:35:50,244 --> 01:35:52,892
There it is, right there. How much
closer am I supposed to bring you?

1592
01:35:52,997 --> 01:35:54,769
They'll wonder how I got here.

1593
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:57,438
Tell 'em a family
friend brung you,

1594
01:35:57,543 --> 01:35:59,383
and you had a little
trouble on the

1595
01:35:59,384 --> 01:36:01,275
way with your car
and with finances.

1596
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:03,027
Now, get going.

1597
01:36:45,633 --> 01:36:46,654
Yes?

1598
01:36:48,010 --> 01:36:49,615
Yes?

1599
01:36:51,096 --> 01:36:52,451
I'm Addie.

1600
01:36:53,182 --> 01:36:54,703
Addie?

1601
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:56,163
Addie.

1602
01:36:56,268 --> 01:36:59,041
I've been worried sick about you.

1603
01:36:59,146 --> 01:37:01,585
Addie... come on in, child.

1604
01:38:12,011 --> 01:38:13,282
I been writing letters,

1605
01:38:13,387 --> 01:38:14,656
and your Uncle
Daniel's been trying

1606
01:38:14,657 --> 01:38:15,784
to call those people down there

1607
01:38:15,890 --> 01:38:17,453
to see where you've been.

1608
01:38:18,142 --> 01:38:21,707
You're just the spitting image of
your mother, pretty as a picture.

1609
01:38:21,812 --> 01:38:23,999
I don't know why I go
on like this. What

1610
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,920
you need is some
ice-cold lemonade.

1611
01:38:26,025 --> 01:38:28,964
Now you just sit right there,
and I'll be right back.

1612
01:38:30,905 --> 01:38:33,594
Everybody's going to be
so happy to see you.

1613
01:38:35,409 --> 01:38:37,640
We're going to get
those clothes off you.

1614
01:38:37,745 --> 01:38:40,601
You're going to get into
a nice, fresh, bath...

1615
01:38:40,706 --> 01:38:42,895
and then you're going to sleep
in your own little bed,

1616
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,105
alongside your cousin, Edna.

1617
01:38:46,795 --> 01:38:49,234
I just near give up on you, child.

1618
01:38:50,716 --> 01:38:52,804
I bet you're starving
to death. I'm

1619
01:38:52,805 --> 01:38:54,949
going to cut you a
big piece of pie.

1620
01:38:57,264 --> 01:39:00,663
We got those telegrams, and
then we never did hear from ya.

1621
01:39:53,779 --> 01:39:56,677
I told you, I don't want you
riding with me no more.

1622
01:40:01,620 --> 01:40:04,351
You still owe me $200.

1623
01:40:14,425 --> 01:40:15,696
Moze, look.

1624
01:40:20,472 --> 01:40:21,994
Come on.

1625
01:40:24,226 --> 01:40:25,789
