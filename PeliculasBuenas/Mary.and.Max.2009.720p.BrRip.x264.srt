1
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:10,120
<i>Mary Dinkle's eyes were the
colour of muddy puddles.</i>

2
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,160
<i>Her birthmark, the colour of poo.</i>

3
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,690
<i>It was Saturday afternoon,
and she was bored.</i>

4
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,860
<i>Mary wished she had a friend
to play piggybacks with.</i>

5
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,130
<i>Mary's mood ring,</i>

6
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,650
<i>which she'd found
in a cereal box, was grey,</i>

7
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,760
<i>which, according to the chart,</i>

8
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,060
<i>meant she was either pensive,</i>

9
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,770
<i>unconsciously ambitious,
or hungry.</i>

10
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,180
<i>Her only friends
were the Noblets</i>

11
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,190
<i>from her favourite cartoon.</i>

12
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,850
<i>They weren't the real ones
you bought in the shops</i>

13
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,400
<i>but fake ones that she had
to make herself</i>

14
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,830
<i>from shells, Gumnuts, pompoms,</i>

15
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,210
<i>and the chicken bones salvaged
from Friday night's takeaway.</i>

16
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,780
<i>She had to make
all her own toys,</i>

17
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:23,080
<i>and her favourites
were Shrinkies,</i>

18
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,870
<i>potato chip packets that
she had shrunk in the oven.</i>

19
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,980
<i>Mary's father,
Noel Norman Dinkle,</i>

20
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:40,260
<i>worked in a factory attaching
the strings to tea bags.</i>

21
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,180
<i>At show-and-tell,
she told the class</i>

22
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,730
<i>he could get as many
free tea bags as he wanted.</i>

23
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:52,270
<i>Her favourite tea bag
was Earl Grey.</i>

24
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,210
<i>She loved saying, "Earl Grey",</i>

25
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:02,780
<i>and would like one day to marry
someone called Earl Grey.</i>

26
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,740
<i>They would live in a castle
in Scotland,</i>

27
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,370
<i>have nine babies, two ducks,</i>

28
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,750
<i>and a dog called Kevin.</i>

29
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,240
<i>Noel's hobby was to sit
in his shed</i>

30
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,370
<i>and drink Bailey's Irish Cream</i>

31
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,620
<i>and stuff birds he'd found
on the side of the freeway.</i>

32
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,010
<i>Mary wished he'd spend
more time with her</i>

33
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,100
<i>and less with his dead friends.</i>

34
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,520
<i>She also wished she had
some brothers and sisters.</i>

35
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,610
<i>Her mother had told her
she was an accident</i>

36
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,940
<i>How could someone be
an accident?</i>

37
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,630
<i>Grand-Poppy Ralph had told her
that babies were deliberate,</i>

38
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:48,620
<i>and found by dads
at the bottom of their beer.</i>

39
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,620
<i>Grand-Poppy Ralph had smelt
like pickled onions</i>

40
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,840
<i>and had been a member of the
Frankston Ice Breakers for 51 years.</i>

41
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,310
<i>They swam in winter
to feel alive.</i>

42
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,740
<i>Grand-Poppy Ralph had said
it made his nipples erect</i>

43
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,250
<i>He had died the year before,
aged 74,</i>

44
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:17,520
<i>and his best mate, Ken,
had recited a poem in his honour.</i>

45
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,030
<i>"Born in a barn
in the hills of Boronia,</i>

46
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:26,260
<i>"Ralph lived a long life,
then died of pneumonia."</i>

47
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,080
<i>Mary missed him
and often wondered</i>

48
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,180
<i>why he had drunk ammonia.</i>

49
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:35,130
<i>A lot of things puzzled Mary,</i>

50
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:40,640
<i>especially her mother,
Vera Lorraine Dinkle.</i>

51
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,980
<i>To Mary,
Vera always seemed wobbly.</i>

52
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,760
<i>A pretty vicious pull, that one.</i>

53
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,630
<i>And he's out!</i>

54
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:52,360
<i>Vera liked listening
to the cricket while baking,</i>

55
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:56,550
<i>and her main ingredient
was always sherry.</i>

56
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,710
<i>She told Mary
it was a type of tea</i>

57
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:05,730
<i>for grown-ups
that needed constant testing.</i>

58
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,070
<i>Mary thought
her mother tested the sherry...</i>

59
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,890
<i>way too much.</i>

60
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,280
<i>Mary also couldn't understand</i>

61
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:27,220
<i>why Vera was always borrowing.</i>

62
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:32,420
<i>Yesterday, she borrowed some
fish fingers from aisle six.</i>

63
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,040
<i>She told Mary she put things
up her dress</i>

64
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:39,550
<i>to save on plastic bags.</i>

65
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:45,300
<i>Vera was indeed
a complicated soul.</i>

66
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,770
Ooh!

67
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,290
<i>Mary stopped daydreaming</i>

68
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,650
<i>and went and fetched
her pet rooster from the rain.</i>

69
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,660
<i>Her father had found the rooster</i>

70
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,200
<i>on the side of the freeway</i>

71
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,450
<i>after it had fallen off
the back of a slaughter truck.</i>

72
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,460
<i>She named him Ethel.</i>

73
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,840
<i>It was time to watch
the Noblets.</i>

74
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,510
<i>She adored the Noblets,</i>

75
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:26,180
<i>because everyone was brown,
lived in a teapot,</i>

76
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,640
<i>and had oodles of friends.</i>

77
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,020
<i>There was nothing nicer,
Mary thought to herself,</i>

78
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,190
<i>than the smell of a wet rooster,</i>

79
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,480
<i>the sound of rain on the roof,</i>

80
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:40,570
<i>and the taste
of sweetened condensed milk</i>

81
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,360
<i>straight from the can</i>

82
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,120
<i>while watching
your favourite cartoon.</i>

83
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,910
<i>Meanwhile,
a man called Max Horowitz</i>

84
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,920
<i>also watched the Noblets.</i>

85
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,670
<i>Max's small television
had picture but no sound;</i>

86
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,430
<i>his big television, sound
but no picture.</i>

87
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:51,580
<i>He was 44 and liked the Noblets
because they lived</i>

88
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,390
<i>in a delineated and articulated
social structure</i>

89
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,140
<i>with constant
adherent conformity,</i>

90
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:03,320
<i>and also because they had
oodles of friends.</i>

91
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,880
<i>Max had trouble sleeping</i>

92
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,200
<i>and had spent the night
watching television</i>

93
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,950
<i>and catching fish food.</i>

94
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,620
<i>He noted to himself
it was the sixth fly</i>

95
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,120
<i>he'd caught this evening.</i>

96
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,960
<i>He wondered if he should go
to bed and count sheep</i>

97
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,610
<i>or have one more
chocolate hot dog.</i>

98
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,970
<i>He thought he'd try both.</i>

99
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,100
<i>But it didn't work.</i>

100
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,140
<i>It had been 6 hours
and 12 minutes</i>

101
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,810
<i>since Henry the Eighth
had passed away.</i>

102
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,820
<i>And Henry's death had thrown
Max's life into disarray.</i>

103
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,740
<i>It had become asymmetrical,</i>

104
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,450
<i>and the sooner
he got a new fish, the better</i>

105
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,540
<i>Tomorrow he would go
to the pet store</i>

106
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:59,540
<i>and get another Henry: Henry the Ninth.</i>

107
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:15,950
Next.

108
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,480
<i>It was shopping day,</i>

109
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,770
<i>and Mary sat patiently
while her mother...</i>

110
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,110
<i>borrowed some envelopes.</i>

111
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,570
<i>To fill in time,
she scanned the room</i>

112
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,780
<i>and counted how many things
were brown.</i>

113
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,240
<i>There was sticky tape,
rubber bands,</i>

114
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,040
<i>and a phone book
with a picture of a lady</i>

115
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,500
<i>standing in a brown lake
with her hand on fire.</i>

116
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,590
<i>"People had weird names
in America,"</i>

117
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,570
<i>Mary Daisy Dinkle
thought to herself,</i>

118
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,630
<i>funny-sounding people called
Rockefeller and Finkelstein.</i>

119
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,100
<i>She wondered
what they looked like,</i>

120
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,720
<i>how old they were,
and if they were married,</i>

121
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,850
<i>wore glasses, or had found
babies in their beer</i>

122
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,280
<i>Maybe in America,
people found babies elsewhere.</i>

123
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,520
Hmm.

124
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,820
<i>They drank a lot of cola.</i>

125
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,200
<i>Maybe they found them in cans.</i>

126
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,240
<i>But no, they wouldn't fit
through the hole.</i>

127
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,250
<i>Mary had an idea.</i>

128
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:21,660
<i>She would write
to one of the Americans</i>

129
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:24,460
<i>and ask where babies came from.</i>

130
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:30,080
<i>She chose a Mr. M. Horowitz.</i>

131
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,280
Mrs. Dinkle!

132
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,630

133
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,370

<i>the day of his weekly
Overeaters Anonymous meeting,</i>

158
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,930
<i>and tonight he'd felt
especially unsettled,</i>

159
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:06,940

<i>Okay, class.</i>

<i>He'd found the night
even more unbearable</i>

<i>"She said ladies get knocked up</i>

578

<i>Once again, Mary's letter
had triggered an anxiety attack.</i>

579

<i>Max knew nothing about love.</i>

580
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:48,360
<i>It was as... It was as foreign
to him as scuba diving,</i>

581
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,940
<i>and he'd had an appalling history
of getting it all wrong.</i>

582

<i>One Valentine's Day,</i>

583
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:57,420
<i>he'd given Zelda Glutnik</i>

584
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:01,410
<i>a gift he was sure
was appropriate.</i>

585
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:10,260
<i>The only companion
that had ever warmed Max's bed</i>

586
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,050
<i>was his hot water bottle.</i>

587
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:18,720
<i>Romance and love was a mysterious
language he'd given up on.</i>

588
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,050
<i>If only Mary had asked
how a toaster works</i>

589
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:25,630
<i>or asked for an explanation
of the chaos theory.</i>

590
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,850
<i>If only there was
a mathematical equation...</i>

591
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:31,810
<i>for love.</i>

592
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:36,320
<i>He kept eating and thinking.</i>

593
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:54,210
<i>But love was not like
Max's Rubik's Cube.</i>

594
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,420
<i>It could not be solved.</i>

595
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:59,240
<i>And no matter from what angle
he analysed it,</i>

596
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,540
<i>the results were negative.</i>

597
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,480
Beat it, creep!

598
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,170
<i>He felt love
but couldn't articulate it.</i>

599
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:08,510
<i>Its logic was as foreign
to him as...</i>

600
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:12,510
<i>as a salad sandwich.</i>

601
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:15,000
<i>The stars made more sense.</i>

602
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,490
<i>Unit 12, have you responded
to the Hubert Street call?</i>

603
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,160
<i>The anxiety
and stress were too much.</i>

604
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:32,070
<i>The inscrutability of love
finally won,</i>

605
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,660
<i>and Max's brain gave in.</i>

606
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:37,320
Ooh.

607
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,380
<i>He was diagnosed with severe
depression and obesity</i>

608
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:49,260
<i>and spent the next eight months</i>

609
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:52,510
<i>institutionalized and bedridden.</i>

610
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:55,920
<i>They marinated him
in a cocktail of drugs</i>

611
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,090
<i>and performed the usual
therapeutic procedures.</i>

612
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:10,640
<i>Meanwhile,
Mary wondered and waited.</i>

613
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:14,370
<i>Maybe Max's typewriter
had run out of ink.</i>

614
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:18,270
<i>And maybe America
had run out of ink.</i>

615
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:20,900
<i>Maybe his pets had eaten him.</i>

616
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:23,890
<i>Maybe it was her.</i>

617
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:29,400
<i>Was she too demanding,
too boring, too ugly?</i>

618
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:41,520
<i>Filled with anger, confusion,
and self-loathing,</i>

619
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:47,240
<i>Mary tried to erase the memory
of her friend forever.</i>

620
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:38,700
<i>Max had recovered,
and life was balanced,</i>

621
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:43,540
<i>safe, and symmetrical
once again.</i>

622
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:48,220
<i>But Mary still lingered
in his mind.</i>

623
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:51,720
<i>Half of him wanted
to write to her immediately.</i>

624
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:56,140
<i>The other half didn't want to
end up a mental patient again.</i>

625
00:45:56,260 --> 00:46:01,300
<i>At least there was always
Mr Ravioli to be friends with.</i>

626
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:05,180
<i>He was a much safer option.</i>

627
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:10,150
<i>He wondered what Mary
was doing right now.</i>

628
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,870
<i>But she was far from content</i>

629
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:15,250
<i>and struggled on by herself,</i>

630
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,190
<i>saving her money
for a rainy day.</i>

631
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,860
<i>Life went on as usual for Max,</i>

632
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:32,520
<i>and even though he opted
for order and stability,</i>

633
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,620
<i>misfortune was never far away.</i>

634
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:09,340
<i>Luckily, his manslaughter
charges were dismissed</i>

635
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:12,340
<i>because he was labelled
mentally deficient</i>

636
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:15,490
<i>and unlikely to have a motive
for killing a mime artist..</i>

637
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,180
<i>Unlike most people.</i>

638
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:24,330
<i>From then on,
Max cooled himself differently,</i>

639
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:29,840
<i>and things went back to normal
until after his 48th birthday,</i>

640
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:33,110
<i>when his numbers
finally came up.</i>

641
00:47:33,530 --> 00:47:35,190
<i>Welcome to the New York Lottery,</i>

642
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,740
<i>and these are
tonight's winning numbers.</i>

643
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:40,390
<i>3,</i>

644
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:42,830
<i>5,</i>

645
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:45,480
<i>6,</i>

646
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:48,270
<i>9,</i>

647
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:51,120
<i>11,</i>

648
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:53,760
<i>and 12.</i>

649
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:37,500
<i>Max was sensible
with his sudden wealth</i>

650
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:40,170
<i>and had bought
a lifetime supply of chocolate</i>

651
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:45,930
<i>and the complete
Noblet collection.</i>

652
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:50,370
<i>Two of his life goals
had come true,</i>

653
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:53,580
<i>but he still had a lot of money</i>

654
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:56,230
<i>so decided to give it to Ivy...</i>

655
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:57,560
Oh!

656
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,940
<i>Who was also very sensible...</i>

657
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:39,400
<i>Until her own numbers came up.</i>

658
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:50,690
<i>Ivy willed everything
to the local cat shelter,</i>

659
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:55,560
<i>whose owner relocated her kind
donation to his bank account,</i>

660
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:59,850
<i>his wife's new breasts,
a Ferrari,</i>

661
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:02,370
<i>and enough fuel
to get to Mexico.</i>

662
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:13,990
<i>Despite achieving
all his life's goals,</i>

663
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:17,650
<i>Max still felt incomplete.</i>

664
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:23,020
<i>Mr Ravioli just wasn't
cutting the mustard anymore</i>

665
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:27,770
<i>and seemed more interested
in his self-help books.</i>

666

<i>Mary had given Max a taste
of real friendship,</i>

667

no comparison.</i>

668
00:50:35,310 --> 00:50:39,810

669

left, and never came back.</i>

671
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:09,370

672

<i>He told Max that true friendship</i>

673
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:17,150
<i>is seen through the heart,
not through the eyes,</i>

674
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:19,590
<i>and that it was time
he wrote to Mary</i>

675
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:22,350
<i>to reveal his true self</i>

676
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:24,980

Aha!

751
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:05,290
<i>Mary and Max's
friendship was resuscitated,</i>

752

753
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:16,040
<i>Inside Max's head,
his brain was smiling.</i>

<i>between the continents.</i>

757
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:26,550
<i>Max learned to read
Mary's letters with caution,</i>

758
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:30,370
<i>and at the slightest tingle
of tension,</i>

759
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:33,000
<i>he would stop,
take his medication,</i>

760
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:35,250
<i>and soothe his nerves.</i>

761
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:38,970
<i>Each letter he would iron,
laminate,</i>

762
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:41,140
<i>and file in a special place,</i>

763
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:45,900
<i>which also soothed his nerves.</i>

764
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:51,140
<i>He enjoyed answering
her questions</i>

765
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:53,730
<i>and solving her puzzles like,</i>

766
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:56,510
<i>"Do sheep shrink when it rains?"</i>

767
00:57:56,690 --> 00:58:00,560
<i>"Why do old men

<i>"Do gooses get goose bumps?"</i>

<i>"And why is

<i>"And if a taxi goes backwards,
does the driver owe you money?"</i>

772

<i>In turn,
Mary simply enjoyed hearing</i>

773
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:18,490
<i>about Max's fascinating life:</i>

774
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:21,430
<i>How many people
he'd counted littering...</i>

775
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,810
<i>How the latest Henry had died...</i>

776
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:42,050
<i>And new recipes
he'd invented for chicken.</i>

777
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:47,330
<i>Each nourished the other,</i>

778
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:50,070
<i>and as Mary grew taller,</i>

779
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:52,270
<i>Max grew wider,</i>

780
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:59,040
<i>their friendship becoming stronger
than the glue on Mary's Noblets.</i>

781
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:05,250
<i>Although Max found solace
in Mary,</i>

782
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:08,750
<i>he still found the rest
of the world bewildering,</i>

783
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,860
<i>and he couldn't understand</i>

784
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:13,440
<i>why he was seen as the odd one</i>

785
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:17,240
<i>while everyone else
was considered normal.</i>

786
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:21,640
<i>Humans were endlessly illogical.</i>

787
00:59:21,810 --> 00:59:23,650
<i>Why did they throw out food</i>

788
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:27,120
<i>when there were children
starving in India?</i>

789
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:29,590
<i>Why did they clear
the rain forests</i>

790
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:32,400
<i>when they needed the oxygen?</i>

791
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:36,060
<i>And why did they create
bus timetables</i>

792
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:39,190
<i>when they never ran on time?</i>

793
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:41,700
<i>He agreed with
his favourite physicist</i>

794
00:59:42,070 --> 00:59:45,200
<i>that there are only
two things infinite:</i>

795
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:49,200
<i>the universe
and man's stupidity.</i>

796
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:57,500
<i>And for Mary, even though Max
filled her with confidence...</i>

797
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:58,410
Bull's-eye!

798
00:59:58,410 --> 01:00:00,800
<i>...her world was far from perfect.</i>

799
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:05,340
<i>The grip of love
had her by the throat.</i>

800
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:28,330
<i>At 4:59 p.m.</i>

801
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:32,340
<i>on the 8th of the 8th, 1988...</i>

802
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:38,420
<i>Noel Norman Dinkle
attached his last string,</i>

803
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:42,920
<i>and after 40 years
and 40 million tea bags,</i>

804
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:44,880
<i>he retired.</i>

805
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:49,720
<i>To celebrate, Noel announced
he was retiring from taxidermy</i>

806
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:52,890
<i>and taking up
metal detecting instead.</i>

807
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:57,650
<i>But sadly, it was not a hobby
he had for long.</i>

808
01:01:34,830 --> 01:01:38,520
<i>In his will,
Noel had left Mary some money,</i>

809
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,650
<i>so she decided
to go to university</i>

810
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:43,660
<i>and study disorders of the mind,</i>

811
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:47,400
<i>yearning to learn more
about her friend.</i>

812
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:50,470
<i>Mary was as popular
at university</i>

813
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,420
<i>as she was at school.</i>

814
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:57,040

Sure, babe!

making pompoms</i>

902

Max?

Max, it's us.

<i>the colour of muddy puddles.</i>
