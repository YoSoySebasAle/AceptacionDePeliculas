1
00:01:55,116 --> 00:01:59,120
<i>Last night
I dreamt I went to Manderley again.</i>

2
00:01:59,204 --> 00:02:03,625
<i>It seemed to me I stood by the iron gate
leading to the drive,</i>

3
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:08,463
<i>and for a while I could not enter,
for the way was barred to me.</i>

4
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:11,216
<i>Then, like all dreamers,</i>

5
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:14,803
<i>I was possessed of a sudden
with supernatural powers</i>

6
00:02:14,886 --> 00:02:18,681
<i>and passed like a spirit
through the barrier before me.</i>

7
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:21,768
<i>The drive wound away in front of me,</i>

8
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:25,188
<i>twisting and turning
as it had always done.</i>

9
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:30,193
<i>But as I advanced, I was aware
that a change had come upon it.</i>

10
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:32,821
<i>Nature had come into her own again,</i>

11
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:36,282
<i>and little by little
had encroached upon the drive</i>

12
00:02:36,366 --> 00:02:39,452
<i>with long, tenacious fingers.</i>

13
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:46,000
<i>On and on wound the poor thread
that had once been our drive.</i>

14
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:50,588
<i>And finally there was Manderley.</i>

15
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:54,050
<i>Manderley</i> ‒ <i>secretive and silent.</i>

16
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:58,304
<i>Time could not mar
the perfect symmetry of those walls.</i>

17
00:02:58,388 --> 00:03:01,683
<i>Moonlight can play
odd tricks upon the fancy,</i>

18
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:06,312
<i>and suddenly it seemed to me
that light came from the windows.</i>

19
00:03:09,274 --> 00:03:12,068
<i>And then a cloud came upon the moon</i>

20
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:16,823
<i>and hovered an instant
like a dark hand before a face.</i>

21
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:18,533
<i>The illusion went with it.</i>

22
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:23,663
<i>I looked upon a desolate shell</i>

23
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:27,792
<i>with no whisper of the past
about its staring walls.</i>

24
00:03:29,294 --> 00:03:32,046
<i>We can never go back to Manderley again.</i>

25
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,048
<i>That much is certain.</i>

26
00:03:34,132 --> 00:03:36,634
<i>But sometimes in my dreams</i>

27
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:40,263
<i>I do go back to
the strange days of my life</i>

28
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:43,975
<i>which began for me
in the South of France.</i>

29
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:20,053
No! Stop!

30
00:04:20,762 --> 00:04:22,430
What the devil are you shouting about?

31
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:28,478
Who are you? What are you staring at?

32
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:32,148
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to stare.
But I... I only thought ‒

33
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:34,984
Oh, you did, did you?
Well, what are you doing here?

34
00:04:35,068 --> 00:04:36,986
I was only walking.

35
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,698
Well, get on with your walking.
Don't hang about here screaming.

36
00:05:05,807 --> 00:05:08,559
I'll never come to Monte Carlo
out of season again.

37
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:11,270
Not a single well-known
personality in the hotel.

38
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:16,359
Stone cold! Waiter.
<i>Garçon.</i> Call him.

39
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:18,528
Tell him to get me some ‒

40
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:20,738
Why, it's Max de Winter.

41
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:23,992
How do you do?

42
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:30,373
- How do you do?
- I'm Edith Van Hopper.

43
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:32,542
It's so nice to run into you here,

44
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:36,004
just when I was beginning to despair
of finding any old friends here in Monte.

45
00:05:36,087 --> 00:05:38,339
But do sit down
and have some coffee.

46
00:05:38,423 --> 00:05:42,010
Mr. de Winter is having coffee with me.
Ask that stupid waiter for another cup.

47
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:46,723
I'm afraid I must contradict you.
You shall both have coffee with me.

48
00:05:46,806 --> 00:05:48,933
<i>- Garçon.</i> Coffee, please.
- Oui, monsieur.

49
00:05:49,017 --> 00:05:50,935
- A cigarette?
- No, thank you.

50
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:53,730
You know, I recognized you
just as soon as you came in,

51
00:05:53,813 --> 00:05:57,567
though I haven't seen you since
that night at the casino at Palm Beach.

52
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,610
Perhaps you don't remember
an old woman like me.

53
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:01,696
Are you playing the tables much
here at Monte?

54
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:04,574
No, I'm afraid that sort of thing
ceased to amuse me years ago.

55
00:06:04,657 --> 00:06:06,367
I can well understand that.

56
00:06:06,451 --> 00:06:10,413
As for me, if I had a home like Manderley,
I should certainly never come to Monte.

57
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:13,583
I hear it's one of the biggest places
in that part of the country,

58
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,376
and you just can't beat it for beauty.

59
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,880
What do you think of Monte Carlo?
Or don't you think of it at all?

60
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:21,132
Oh, well, I think it's rather artificial.

61
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,926
She's spoiled, Mr. de Winter.
That's her trouble.

62
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,804
Most girls would give their eyes
for a chance to see Monte.

63
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:29,307
Wouldn't that rather defeat the purpose?

64
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:32,894
Now that we've found each other again,
I hope I shall see something of you.

65
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:37,065
You must come and have a drink in my suite.
I hope they've given you a good room.

66
00:06:37,148 --> 00:06:40,193
The place is empty. So if you're
uncomfortable, mind you, make a fuss.

67
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:42,779
Your valet has unpacked for you,
I suppose?

68
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:45,615
I'm afraid I don't possess one.
Perhaps you'd like to do it for me?

69
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:49,410
Well, I... I hardly think ‒

70
00:06:49,494 --> 00:06:53,247
Perhaps you could make yourself useful
to Mr. de Winter if he wants anything done.

71
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:55,500
You're a capable child in many ways.

72
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,377
That's a charming suggestion,
but I'm afraid I cling to the old motto:

73
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:00,755
"He travels fastest who travels alone."

74
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:03,299
Perhaps you've not heard of it.
Good night.

75
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,968
What do you make of that?

76
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:09,597
Do you suppose that sudden departure
was intended to be funny?

77
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,974
Come, don't sit there gawking.
Let's go upstairs.

78
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:14,143
- Have you got the key?
- Yes, Mrs. Van Hopper.

79
00:07:14,227 --> 00:07:17,146
I remember when I was younger
there was a well-known writer

80
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,233
who used to dart down the back way
whenever he saw me coming.

81
00:07:20,316 --> 00:07:23,820
I suppose he was in love with me
and wasn't quite sure of himself.

82
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,988
Well, <i>c'est la vie.</i>

83
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:30,326
By the way, my dear,
don't think that I mean to be unkind,

84
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:33,454
but you were just a teeny, weeny bit
forward with Mr. de Winter.

85
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:36,707
Your effort to enter the conversation
quite embarrassed me,

86
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,000
and I'm sure it did him.

87
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:41,212
Men loathe that sort of thing.
Oh, come. Don't sulk.

88
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:44,340
After all, I am responsible
for your behavior here.

89
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:47,343
Perhaps he didn't notice it.
Poor thing.

90
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:49,679
I suppose he just can't
get over his wife's death.

91
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:53,266
They say he simply adored her.

92
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:11,617
Louis.

93
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:14,829
Oh! How awkward of me.

94
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:19,542
What a stupid thing to do.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

95
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,252
Please don't bother.
It doesn't really matter.

96
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:23,880
Leave that. Leave that.
Go and lay another place at my table.

97
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:26,883
- Mademoiselle will have lunch with me.
- Oh, but I couldn't possibly.

98
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:28,676
- Why not?
- Oh, please don't be polite.

99
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,596
It's very kind of you, but I'll be all right
if they just change the cloth.

100
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:32,555
I wasn't being polite.

101
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:35,558
I should have asked you to have lunch with me
even if you hadn't upset the vase so clumsily.

102
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:39,270
Come along. We needn't talk to
each other if we don't feel like it.

103
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:40,980
Thank you very much.

104
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,446
Oh, I'll just ha-have
s-some scrambled eggs.

105
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,156
Oui, mademoiselle.

106
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:55,494
- What's happened to your friend?
- Oh, she's ill in bed with a cold.

107
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:59,498
I'm sorry I was so rude to you yesterday.

108
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:03,002
The only excuse I can offer is that
I've become boorish through living alone.

109
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:05,755
You weren't really.
You simply wanted to be alone, and ‒

110
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:09,842
Tell me, is Mrs. Van Hopper
a friend of yours or just a relation?

111
00:09:09,926 --> 00:09:12,970
No, she's my employer.
I'm what is known as a paid companion.

112
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:15,264
I didn't know companionship
could be bought.

113
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:17,516
I looked up the word "companion"
in the dictionary once.

114
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,936
It said, "a friend of the bosom."

115
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:22,104
I don't envy you the privilege.

116
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:25,608
Oh, she's very kind, really,
and I have to earn my living.

117
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:29,111
- Haven't you any family?
- No, my mother died years and years ago.

118
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:31,948
And then there was only my father.

119
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:35,785
And he died last summer,
and then I took this job.

120
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:37,453
How rotten for you.

121
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:41,207
Yes, it was rather, because,
you see, we got on so well together.

122
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,583
You and your father?

123
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:45,586
Yes. He was a lovely person.
Very unusual.

124
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,296
- What was he?
- A painter.

125
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,840
- Ah. Was he a good one?
- Well, I thought so.

126
00:09:49,924 --> 00:09:52,343
But people didn't understand him.

127
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,595
Yes, that's often the trouble.

128
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:58,057
He painted trees.
At least it was one tree.

129
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,977
You mean he painted the same tree
over and over again?

130
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,690
Yes. You see, he had a theory that if you should
find one perfect thing or place or person,

131
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:06,857
you should stick to it.

132
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:08,859
Do you think that's very silly?

133
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:11,362
Not at all.
I'm a firm believer in that myself.

134
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:14,699
And what did you find to do with yourself
while he was painting his tree?

135
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:18,536
Oh, I sat with him and I sketched a little.
I don't do it very well though.

136
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,746
- You're going sketching this afternoon?
- Yes.

137
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,707
- Where?
- I haven't made up my mind.

138
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,793
- I'll drive you somewhere in the car.
- Oh, no, please. I didn't mean ‒

139
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:28,504
Oh, nonsense.
Finish up that mess and we'll get along.

140
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:31,507
Thank you. It's very kind of you.
But I'm not very hungry.

141
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,093
Oh, come on.
Eat it up like a good girl.

142
00:10:45,438 --> 00:10:48,524
You've taken long enough for that sketch.
I shall expect a really fine work of art.

143
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:50,901
Oh, no, don't look at it.
It's not nearly good enough.

144
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:54,905
Well, it can't be as bad as all that.
Don't rub it all out. Let me see it first.

145
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:57,950
- It's the perspective. I never can get it right.
- Let me see.

146
00:10:58,034 --> 00:11:00,036
Oh, dear. Tell me, is it the perspective

147
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:03,122
that gives my nose
that curious twist in the middle?

148
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:05,458
- Well, you're not a very easy subject to sketch.
- No?

149
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,711
- Your expression keeps changing all the time.
- Does it?

150
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:11,714
Well, I'd concentrate on
the view instead if I were you.

151
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:13,382
Much more worthwhile.

152
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:17,511
It rather reminds me of our coastline at home.
Do you know Cornwall at all?

153
00:11:17,595 --> 00:11:19,889
Yes. I went there once
with my father on holiday.

154
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:24,018
I was in a shop once,
and I saw a postcard

155
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:26,729
with a beautiful house on it,
right by the sea.

156
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:30,566
And I asked whose house it was,
and the old lady said, "That's Manderley."

157
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:33,819
- I felt ashamed for not knowing.
- Manderley is beautiful.

158
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,407
To me, it's just the place
where I was born

159
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:40,659
and have lived in all my life.

160
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:44,538
But now, I don't suppose
I shall ever see it again.

161
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:56,217
We're lucky not to be home
during the bad weather, aren't we?

162
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,885
Hmm.

163
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:02,515
I can't ever remember enjoying swimming
in England until June, can you?

164
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:08,312
The water's so warm here
that I could stay in all day.

165
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:12,191
There's a dangerous undertow,
and there was a man drowned here last year.

166
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,487
I never have any fear of drowning.
Have you?

167
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,663
Come. I'll take you home.

168
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:44,140
Oh, yes. I know
Mr. de Winter well. I knew his wife too.

169
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:47,518
Before she married, she was
the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth, you know.

170
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,104
She was drowned, poor dear,
while she was sailing near Manderley.

171
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:53,065
He never talks about it, of course,
but he's a broken man.

172
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:55,901
I suppose I'd better have it.
Wretched stuff!

173
00:12:55,985 --> 00:12:58,028
Give me a chocolate, quick!

174
00:12:58,112 --> 00:13:02,074
Oh, there you are. It's about time.
Hurry up. I want to play some rummy.

175
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:12,668
<i>She was
the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth, you know.</i>

176
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,879
<i>They say he simply adored her.</i>

177
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:17,173
<i>She was the beautiful
Rebecca Hildreth, you know.</i>

178
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:19,550
<i>I suppose he just can't
get over his wife's death.</i>

179
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,969
<i>She was the beautiful
Rebecca Hildreth, you know.</i>

180
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,263
<i>But he's a broken man.</i>

181
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:28,934
- Bonjour.
- Well, where are you going?

182
00:13:29,018 --> 00:13:31,270
- Oh, I thought I'd take a tennis lesson.
- I see.

183
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:34,607
I suppose you've had a look at the pro,
and he's desperately handsome

184
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,693
and you've conceived
a schoolgirl crush on him.

185
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:40,321
All right, go ahead.
Make the most of it.

186
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:44,533
- Off duty?
- Oh, yes.

187
00:13:44,617 --> 00:13:47,703
Mrs. Van Hopper's cold has turned into flu,
so she's got a trained nurse.

188
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:50,748
- I'm sorry for the nurse. You keen on tennis?
- No, not particularly.

189
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:53,792
That's good. We'll go for a drive.

190
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:15,105
Good afternoon, Mrs. Van Hopper.
How are you feeling?

191
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:17,191
You got on rather well with him, didn't you?

192
00:14:19,235 --> 00:14:22,279
That pro must have been
teaching you other things than tennis.

193
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:26,492
Hurry up.
I want you to make some calls.

194
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:29,578
I wonder if Mr. de Winter
is still in the hotel.

195
00:15:22,715 --> 00:15:24,633
May I go now?

196
00:15:24,717 --> 00:15:27,928
For the number of lessons you've had,
you ought to be ready for Wimbledon.

197
00:15:28,012 --> 00:15:30,431
But this will be your last,
so make the most of it.

198
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:33,267
The trouble is, with me laid up like this,
you haven't had enough to do.

199
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,854
But I'm getting rid of that nurse today,
and from now on you'll stick to your job.

200
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:39,481
Yes, Mrs. Van Hopper.

201
00:15:41,317 --> 00:15:43,652
- Nurse!
- Yes, Mrs. Van Hopper?

202
00:15:43,736 --> 00:15:47,531
Are you absolutely sure you left
those messages for Mr. de Winter?

203
00:15:47,615 --> 00:15:50,367
- Why, yes, madame.
- I simply can't believe it.

204
00:15:50,451 --> 00:15:52,953
He would most certainly
have called me back.

205
00:15:53,037 --> 00:15:56,498
Oh, well. Poor boy.
I simply hate to see him so alone.

206
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,383
You know, I...
I wish there could be an invention

207
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:09,887
that bottled up the memory like perfume.

208
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,097
And it never faded, never got stale.

209
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:14,433
Then whenever I wanted to,
I could uncork the bottle

210
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,644
and live the memory all over again.

211
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:19,563
And what particular moment in your young life
would you want to keep?

212
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:22,274
Oh, all of them,
all these last few days.

213
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:27,071
I feel as though I'd... I'd collected
a whole shelf full of bottles.

214
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:30,908
Sometimes, you know,
those little bottles contain demons

215
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:34,662
that have a way of popping out at you just
as you're trying most desperately to forget.

216
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:47,966
Stop biting your nails.

217
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,804
Oh, I wish I were a woman of 36,

218
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:54,139
dressed in black satin,
with a string of pearls.

219
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:57,142
You wouldn't be
here with me if you were.

220
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:03,482
Would you please tell me, Mr. de Winter,
why you asked me to come out with you?

221
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:06,026
Oh, it's obvious
that you want to be kind,

222
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,946
but why do you choose me
for your charity?

223
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:18,747
I asked you to come out with me
because I wanted your company.

224
00:17:18,831 --> 00:17:22,668
You've blotted out the past for me more
than all the bright lights of Monte Carlo.

225
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:25,879
But if you think I just asked you
out of kindness or charity,

226
00:17:25,963 --> 00:17:28,841
you can leave the car now
and find your own way home.

227
00:17:28,924 --> 00:17:30,718
Go on, open the door and get out.

228
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:41,937
- Better blow your nose.
- Thank you.

229
00:17:43,564 --> 00:17:45,941
Please don't call me Mr. de Winter.

230
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:48,819
I have a very impressive
array of first names.

231
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:51,697
George Fortescue Maximilian.
But you needn't bother with them all at once.

232
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,074
My family call me Maxim.

233
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:58,036
And another thing.

234
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,206
Please promise me
never to wear black satin or pearls

235
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,293
or to be 36 years old.

236
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:07,212
Yes, Maxim.

237
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:45,667
For the love of Pete! Come here!

238
00:18:45,751 --> 00:18:48,545
What do you think?
My daughter's engaged to be married.

239
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:51,131
- Oh, really? How nice.
- We must leave for New York at once.

240
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:55,385
Get reservations on the <i>Aquitania,</i>
and we'll take the 12:30 train for Cherbourg.

241
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:58,555
Hurry up and get a maid to help with
the packing. We've no time to waste.

242
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:00,390
Go on and don't dawdle!

243
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:06,021
Mr. de Winter, please.

244
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:08,398
Oh, he's gone out riding?

245
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,818
He won't be back till noon?

246
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:16,240
Oh, well, give me the porter, please.

247
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:26,959
I'll go and see if there's
anything left in my room.

248
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:37,010
Has Mr. de Winter come in yet?

249
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:39,680
Oh, he has?
Would you connect me, please?

250
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:53,402
Oh, I was looking for my book.
I suppose I've packed it.

251
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:55,904
Well, come on.
The car's waiting at the door.

252
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:14,548
I'd like to leave a forwarding address
if they happen to find that book.

253
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:20,137
Would you ring Mr. de Winter, please?

254
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,347
Yes, madam<i>. Cent vingt-deux.</i>

255
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,859
- There isn't any answer.
- Thank you.

256
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:38,864
- Tell her to hurry up!
- Yes, madam.

257
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:42,618
I was looking for Mr. de Winter.

258
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:45,662
Mr. de Winter just ordered
breakfast in his room, mademoiselle.

259
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:52,085
Come in.

260
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:09,978
Hello. What are you doing here?
Anything the matter?

261
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:12,981
I've come to say good-bye.
We're going away.

262
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:15,817
- What on earth are you talking about?
- It's true.

263
00:21:15,901 --> 00:21:19,279
We're going now, and I was afraid
I wouldn't see you again.

264
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:28,997
- Where is she taking you to?
- New York.

265
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:31,917
I don't want to go.
I shall hate it. I shall be miserable.

266
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:38,507
I'll dress in here.

267
00:21:39,508 --> 00:21:41,134
I shan't be long.

268
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:47,474
Which would you prefer,
New York or Manderley?

269
00:21:47,557 --> 00:21:50,727
Oh, please don't joke about it.
Mrs. Van Hopper's waiting.

270
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:53,772
And I-I'd better say good-bye now.

271
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,858
I repeat what I said.

272
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:59,069
Either you go to America
with Mrs. Van Hopper,

273
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:01,530
or you come home
to Manderley with me.

274
00:22:01,613 --> 00:22:03,865
You mean you want
a secretary or something?

275
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:05,993
I'm asking you to marry me,
you little fool.

276
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,837
Come in.

277
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:21,800
Is that my food? I'm famished.
I didn't have any breakfast.

278
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,819
Ah, my suggestion didn't seem
to go at all well. I'm sorry.

279
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:45,365
Oh, but you don't understand.
It's that I'm not the sort of person men marry.

280
00:22:45,449 --> 00:22:47,868
What on earth do you mean?

281
00:22:47,951 --> 00:22:50,412
I don't belong in your sort of world,
for one thing.

282
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:52,414
Well, what is my sort of world?

283
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:55,459
Oh, well, Manderley.
You know what I mean.

284
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:58,253
Well, I'm the best judge
of whether you belong there or not.

285
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:00,881
Of course, if you don't love me,
that's a different thing.

286
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:03,091
Fine blow to my conceit, that's all.

287
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:05,719
Oh, I do love you.
I love you most dreadfully.

288
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:09,056
I've been crying all morning because
I thought I'd never see you again.

289
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:15,145
Bless you for that.

290
00:23:17,189 --> 00:23:20,817
I'll remind you of this one day,
and you won't believe me.

291
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:24,321
It's a pity you have to grow up.

292
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:28,909
Well, now that's settled,
you may pour me out some coffee.

293
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:31,078
Two lumps of sugar
and some milk, please.

294
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:33,789
Same with my tea.
Don't forget.

295
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:36,083
Who's going to break the news
to Mrs. Van Hopper?

296
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,168
Oh, you tell her.
She'll be so angry.

297
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:40,087
What's the number of her room?

298
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:43,006
Oh, she's not there.
She's downstairs in the car.

299
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,675
Hello. Give me the desk, please.

300
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,765
Hello. You'll find Mrs. Van Hopper
waiting outside in her car.

301
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:54,309
Would you ask her,
with my compliments,

302
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:56,978
if she'd very kindly come up
and see me in my room?

303
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:58,980
Yes, in my room.

304
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,360
Mr. de Winter says please
for you to come up to his room.

305
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:07,114
Mr. de Winter? Why, certainly.

306
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:16,206
This isn't at all
your idea of a proposal, is it?

307
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,208
It should be in a conservatory,

308
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:21,211
you in a white frock
with a red rose in your hand

309
00:24:21,294 --> 00:24:23,547
and a violin playing in the distance,

310
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:27,050
and I should be making violent
love to you behind a palm tree.

311
00:24:27,134 --> 00:24:30,053
Poor darling. Never mind.

312
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:32,430
Oh, I don't mind.

313
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:36,810
Don't worry. Don't worry.
You won't have to say a word.

314
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:39,437
I'm so glad you called me,
Mr. de Winter.

315
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:42,649
I was making a hasty departure.
It was so rude of me not to let you know.

316
00:24:42,732 --> 00:24:44,651
But a cable came
this morning announcing

317
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:46,653
that my daughter
is engaged to be married.

318
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:48,905
That's rather a coincidence,
Mrs. Van Hopper.

319
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:51,575
I asked you up here in order
to tell you of my engagement.

320
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:54,578
You don't mean it!
Oh, how perfectly wonderful!

321
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:57,747
How romantic.
Who is the lucky lady?

322
00:24:58,623 --> 00:25:01,585
I apologize for depriving you
of your companion in this abrupt way.

323
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:04,171
I do hope it won't
inconvenience you too greatly.

324
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:05,797
When did all this happen?

325
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:10,510
Just now, Mrs. Van Hopper.
Just a few minutes ago.

326
00:25:10,594 --> 00:25:12,846
I simply can't believe it.

327
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:18,852
I suppose I ought to scold you for not
having breathed a word of all this to me.

328
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:20,854
What am I thinking of?

329
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:22,981
I shall give you both
my congratulations and my blessings.

330
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:26,526
I'm very happy for you both.
When and where is the wedding to be?

331
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,236
Here, as soon as possible.

332
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,782
A whirlwind romance! Splendid!
I could easily postpone my sailing for a week.

333
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:34,784
This poor child has no mother,

334
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:37,454
so I shall take responsibility
for all the arrangements ‒

335
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:39,080
trousseau, reception and everything.

336
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:41,416
And I'll give the bride away.
But our luggage.

337
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:43,418
Go down and tell the porter to
take everything out of the car.

338
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:46,213
Just a minute.
We're most grateful, Mrs. Van Hopper.

339
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:49,591
But I think we'd both prefer
to have it as quiet as possible.

340
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:52,052
And I couldn't possibly allow you
to change your sailing plans.

341
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:53,178
- Oh, but ‒
- No, no, no.

342
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:56,264
Dear, I'll go down and see
that your luggage is brought back.

343
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:58,016
Thank you, Maxim.

344
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:02,395
So this is what's been happening
during my illness.

345
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:05,065
Tennis lessons, my foot.

346
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:07,442
I suppose I have to hand it to you
for a fast worker.

347
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:10,654
How did you manage it?
Still waters certainly run deep.

348
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:18,286
Tell me, have you been doing
anything you shouldn't?

349
00:26:19,871 --> 00:26:21,498
I don't know what you mean.

350
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:25,794
Oh, well, never mind. I always did say
that Englishmen have strange tastes.

351
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:28,588
But you certainly have your work cut out
as mistress of Manderley.

352
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:31,591
To be perfectly frank with you, my dear,
I can't see you doing it.

353
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:33,134
You haven't the experience.

354
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:35,929
You haven't the faintest idea
what it means to be a great lady.

355
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:40,308
Of course, you know why
he's marrying you, don't you?

356
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:42,477
You haven't flattered yourself
that he's in love with you.

357
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,397
The fact is, that empty house
got on his nerves to such an extent

358
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,898
he nearly went off his head.

359
00:26:46,982 --> 00:26:49,067
He just couldn't go on living alone.

360
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:52,070
You'd better leave, Mrs. Van Hopper.
You'll miss your train.

361
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:01,746
Mrs. de Winter.

362
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:04,207
Good-bye, my dear, and good luck.

363
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,905
<i>Monsieur! Vous avez oublié
votre carnet de mariage.</i>

364
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:38,825
He says I've forgotten
the proof that we're married.

365
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,827
Good heavens!

366
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:50,837
Ah, somebody else had the same idea.

367
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:59,596
- Isn't she sweet?
- Yes.

368
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,183
You'd have liked a bridal veil,
wouldn't you?

369
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:06,436
Or at least ‒

370
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:08,980
<i>Madame, madame,
combien ça fait? Tout, le tout?</i>

371
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:10,607
<i>Je vous remercie mille fois.</i>

372
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,108
<i>- Merci.
- Merci.</i>

373
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:15,403
Oh, Maxim, how lovely.

374
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:18,114
Oh, how perfectly lovely.

375
00:28:20,867 --> 00:28:23,036
Oh, perfectly lovely.

376
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:32,003
- Welcome home, Mr. de Winter.
- Thank you, Smith.

377
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:43,515
- Cold, darling?
- Yes, just a little bit.

378
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:48,144
There's no need
to be frightened, you know.

379
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:50,230
Just be yourself,
and they'll all adore you.

380
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:57,612
You don't have to worry
about the house at all.

381
00:28:57,695 --> 00:29:00,615
Mrs. Danvers is the housekeeper.
Just leave it to her.

382
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:10,208
Hello. Starting to rain.
We'd better hurry up.

383
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,965
Here, have this.
Put it over your head.

384
00:29:17,048 --> 00:29:19,008
Thank you.

385
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:21,010
Yes.

386
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:35,358
That's it. That's Manderley.

387
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:03,219
Here we are, Frith.
Everybody well?

388
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:05,805
Yes, thank you, sir.
Glad to see you home, sir.

389
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:08,641
- This is Mrs. de Winter, Frith.
- How do you do?

390
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:19,402
I didn't expect the whole staff
to be in attendance.

391
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:21,404
Mrs. Danvers' orders, sir.

392
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:24,324
Oh. Sorry about this.
Won't take long.

393
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:36,169
This is Mrs. Danvers.

394
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:40,173
How do you do?

395
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:43,259
How do you do?

396
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:45,637
I have everything
in readiness for you.

397
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,890
That's very good of you.
I didn't expect anything.

398
00:30:54,187 --> 00:30:56,356
I think we'd like some tea, Frith.

399
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:57,982
Ready in the library, sir.

400
00:30:58,066 --> 00:30:59,567
Come along, darling.

401
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:16,125
Oh, Maxim! Come in!

402
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,672
Oh, good evening, Mrs. Danvers.

403
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:22,173
Good evening, madam.

404
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:32,016
I hope Alice was satisfactory, madam.

405
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,269
- Oh, yes, thank you. Perfectly.
- She's the parlor maid.

406
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:36,813
She'll have to look after you
until your own maid arrives.

407
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:39,649
Oh, but I haven't a maid.
I'm sure Alice will do very nicely.

408
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:42,193
I'm afraid that would not do
for very long, madam.

409
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:45,822
It's usual for ladies in your position
to have a personal maid.

410
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:49,826
I hope you approve the new decoration
of these rooms, madam.

411
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:52,161
Oh, I didn't know
it had been changed.

412
00:31:52,245 --> 00:31:54,539
I hope you haven't been
to too much trouble.

413
00:31:54,622 --> 00:31:57,083
I only followed out
Mr. de Winter's instructions.

414
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:59,377
Oh. Well, what did it look like before?

415
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,629
It had an old paper
and different hangings.

416
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:04,215
It was never used much,
except for occasional visitors.

417
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:07,051
Oh, then it wasn't
Mr. de Winter's room originally?

418
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:10,680
No, madam. He's never used
the east wing before.

419
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:13,391
Of course, there's no view
of the sea from here.

420
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:16,853
The only good view of the sea
is from the west wing.

421
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:20,982
The room's very charming,
and I'm sure I'll be comfortable.

422
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:23,651
If there's anything you want done,
madam, you have only to tell me.

423
00:32:23,735 --> 00:32:27,030
I suppose you've been at Manderley
for many years, longer than anyone else.

424
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:30,074
Not so long as Frith. He was here
when the old gentleman was living,

425
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:32,327
when Mr. de Winter was a boy.

426
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:35,455
Oh, I see.
And you didn't come till after that?

427
00:32:35,538 --> 00:32:38,916
I came here when
the first Mrs. de Winter was a bride.

428
00:32:43,171 --> 00:32:46,841
Mrs. Danvers,
I do hope we'll be friends.

429
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:48,718
You must be patient with me.

430
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:52,180
This sort of life is new to me,
and I do want to make a success of it

431
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:54,474
and make Mr. de Winter happy.

432
00:32:54,557 --> 00:32:57,310
So I know I can leave
all the household arrangements to you.

433
00:32:57,393 --> 00:33:00,980
Very well. I hope I shall do everything
to your satisfaction, madam.

434
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:03,232
I've managed the house
since Mrs. de Winter's death,

435
00:33:03,316 --> 00:33:05,443
and Mr. de Winter
has never complained.

436
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:14,952
I think I'll go downstairs now.

437
00:33:50,655 --> 00:33:54,450
That room in the west wing I was
telling you about is there through that door.

438
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:56,202
It's not used now.

439
00:33:57,161 --> 00:34:00,039
It's the most beautiful
room in the house ‒

440
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:03,209
the only one that looks down
across the lawns to the sea.

441
00:34:04,961 --> 00:34:07,213
It was Mrs. de Winter's room.

442
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,836
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

443
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,671
You're Mrs. de Winter, aren't you?

444
00:35:30,755 --> 00:35:32,840
- Yes.
- My name's Crawley.

445
00:35:32,924 --> 00:35:35,468
I-I manage the estate for Maxim.

446
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:37,887
Awfully glad to meet you.

447
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:41,849
There's a fearful lot of stuff
piled up while Maxim was away.

448
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:44,268
Yes, I'm sure there must have been.

449
00:35:44,352 --> 00:35:47,355
- I do wish I could help with some of it.
- Oh, no.

450
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:49,690
Frank never allows anybody to help him.

451
00:35:49,774 --> 00:35:52,443
He's like an old mother hen
with his bills and rents and taxes.

452
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:55,446
- Come on, Frank. We must go over these estimates.
- I'll get my papers.

453
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,156
You'll find quantities
of breakfast over there,

454
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,158
but you must eat it all,
or cook will be mortally offended.

455
00:35:59,242 --> 00:36:00,993
I'll do my best, Maxim.

456
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:04,205
I have to go over the place with Frank
to make sure he hasn't lost any of it.

457
00:36:04,288 --> 00:36:06,499
- But you'll be all right, won't you?
- Mm-hmm.

458
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:08,793
Getting acquainted
with your new home?

459
00:36:08,876 --> 00:36:10,127
Have a look at <i>The Times.</i>

460
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:13,214
There's a thrilling article
on what's the matter with English cricket.

461
00:36:13,798 --> 00:36:16,008
Oh, uh, yes, um ‒

462
00:36:16,092 --> 00:36:20,054
My sister Beatrice and her husband Giles Lacy
have invited themselves over for lunch.

463
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:22,139
- Today?
- Yes.

464
00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:24,934
I suppose the old girl
can't wait to look you over.

465
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:26,561
You'll find her very direct.

466
00:36:26,644 --> 00:36:29,689
If she doesn't like you,
she'll probably tell you so to your face.

467
00:36:29,772 --> 00:36:32,817
Don't worry, darling. I'll be back
in time to protect you from her.

468
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,194
- Good-bye, darling.
- Good-bye, Maxim.

469
00:36:35,278 --> 00:36:37,196
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

470
00:37:17,403 --> 00:37:19,739
- Good morning, madam.
- Good morning, Frith.

471
00:37:25,912 --> 00:37:27,788
Isn't there anything
I could get for you, madam?

472
00:37:27,872 --> 00:37:30,875
Oh, no, thank you, Frith.
I'm really not very hungry.

473
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:33,669
Thank you.

474
00:37:33,753 --> 00:37:36,839
- The paper, madam.
- Oh, yes. Thank you, Frith.

475
00:37:41,552 --> 00:37:43,346
- Madam.
- I slipped.

476
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:45,097
Oh, thank you, Frith.

477
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:53,064
- It's big, isn't it?
- Yes, madam. Manderley is a big place.

478
00:37:53,147 --> 00:37:55,399
This was the banquet hall
in the old days.

479
00:37:55,483 --> 00:37:59,236
It's still used on great occasions,
such as a big dinner or a ball.

480
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,782
And the public is admitted here,
you know, once a week.

481
00:38:02,865 --> 00:38:04,784
That's nice.

482
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,183
I beg pardon, madam.

483
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:32,687
I'm afraid the fire is not usually
lit in the library until the afternoon.

484
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,355
But you'll find one
in the morning room.

485
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:36,899
Of course, if you wish
this fire lit now, madam ‒

486
00:38:36,983 --> 00:38:39,318
Oh, no, Frith.
I wouldn't dream of it.

487
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:43,531
Uh, Mrs. de Winter ‒

488
00:38:43,614 --> 00:38:46,951
I mean, the late Mrs. de Winter always
did her correspondence and telephoning

489
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:49,245
in the morning room after breakfast.

490
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:51,539
Thank you, Frith.

491
00:38:57,628 --> 00:38:59,547
Is anything wrong, madam?

492
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:02,216
Oh, no.
Uh, which way is the morning room?

493
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:06,012
- Oh, it's that door there on the left.
- Oh, yes, thank you.

494
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:03,402
Mrs. de Winter?
Oh, I'm afraid you've made a mistake.

495
00:40:03,486 --> 00:40:05,696
Mrs. de Winter's
been dead for over a year.

496
00:40:07,531 --> 00:40:10,076
Oh, I mean, I ‒

497
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:13,329
Oh.

498
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:16,248
That was the house telephone, madam.

499
00:40:16,332 --> 00:40:19,335
Probably the head gardener
wishing instructions.

500
00:40:20,586 --> 00:40:23,005
Did you want to see me, Mrs. Danvers?

501
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:25,925
Mr. de Winter informed me that
his sister Mrs. Lacy and Major Lacy

502
00:40:26,008 --> 00:40:27,676
are expected for luncheon.

503
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,304
I'd like to know
if you approve of the menu.

504
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:33,557
Oh, well, I-I'm sure
it's very suitable, very nice indeed.

505
00:40:33,641 --> 00:40:36,852
You'll notice, madam, that
I've left a blank space for the sauce.

506
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:40,064
Mrs. de Winter was most
particular about sauces.

507
00:40:40,147 --> 00:40:42,983
Let's have whatever you think
that Mrs. de Winter would have ordered.

508
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:45,111
Thank you, madam.

509
00:40:46,112 --> 00:40:49,115
When you've finished your letters,
Robert will take them to the post.

510
00:40:49,198 --> 00:40:50,699
My let ‒ My letters?

511
00:40:52,118 --> 00:40:55,287
Oh, yes, of course.
Thank you, Mrs. Danvers.

512
00:41:52,636 --> 00:41:55,347
- How are you, Frith?
- Good morning, Mrs. Lacy.

513
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:56,599
Where's Mr. de Winter?

514
00:41:56,682 --> 00:41:58,851
I believe he went down to the farm
with Mr. Crawley.

515
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:02,313
How tiresome of him not to be here
when we arrive, and how typical.

516
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:17,411
I must say, old Danvers
keeps the house looking lovely.

517
00:42:17,494 --> 00:42:20,748
She certainly learned that trick
of arranging flowers from Rebecca.

518
00:42:20,831 --> 00:42:22,791
I wonder how she likes it now,

519
00:42:22,875 --> 00:42:25,586
being ordered about
by an ex-chorus girl.

520
00:42:25,669 --> 00:42:27,880
Where on earth did you
get the idea she's an ex-chorus girl?

521
00:42:27,963 --> 00:42:30,674
He picked her up
in the South of France, didn't he?

522
00:42:30,758 --> 00:42:34,178
- What if he did?
- Well, I mean to say, there you are.

523
00:42:40,476 --> 00:42:42,353
How do you do? I-I'm Maxim's wife.

524
00:42:42,436 --> 00:42:44,146
How do you do?

525
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,732
Well, I must say you're quite different
from what I expected.

526
00:42:46,815 --> 00:42:49,777
Don't be so silly.
She's exactly what I told you she'd be.

527
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,821
- Well, how do you like Manderley?
- Very beautiful, isn't it?

528
00:42:52,905 --> 00:42:54,949
And how do you get along
with Mrs. Danvers?

529
00:42:55,032 --> 00:42:58,827
Well, I ‒ I've never met anyone
quite like her before.

530
00:42:58,911 --> 00:43:02,331
You mean she scares you?
She's not exactly an oil painting, is she?

531
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:05,334
Giles, you're very much in the way here.
Go somewhere else.

532
00:43:05,417 --> 00:43:07,461
I'll try and find Maxim, shall I?

533
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:09,338
Giles.

534
00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:13,676
I-I didn't mean to say anything
against Mrs. Danvers.

535
00:43:13,759 --> 00:43:16,011
Oh, there's no need for you
to be frightened of her.

536
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:19,014
But I shouldn't have any more
to do with her than you can help.

537
00:43:19,098 --> 00:43:22,017
- Shall we sit down?
- Oh, yes, yes, please.

538
00:43:22,101 --> 00:43:25,396
You see, she's bound to be
insanely jealous at first,

539
00:43:25,479 --> 00:43:27,564
and she must resent you bitterly.

540
00:43:27,648 --> 00:43:28,857
But why should she?

541
00:43:28,941 --> 00:43:30,901
Don't you know?

542
00:43:30,985 --> 00:43:33,570
I should have thought
Maxim would have told you.

543
00:43:33,654 --> 00:43:35,948
She simply adored Rebecca.

544
00:43:45,874 --> 00:43:47,960
- How are you, Robert?
- Quite well, thank you, madam.

545
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:51,088
- Still having trouble with your teeth?
- Unfortunately, yes, madam.

546
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:54,883
You should have them out, all of them.
Wretched nuisances, teeth.

547
00:43:54,967 --> 00:43:57,303
- Thank you, madam.
- Ooh, what a plateful.

548
00:43:57,386 --> 00:44:00,597
- Do you hunt?
- No, I don't. I'm afraid I don't even ride.

549
00:44:00,681 --> 00:44:03,225
Oh, have to ride down here.
We all do.

550
00:44:03,309 --> 00:44:06,353
Which do you ride,
sidesaddle or astride?

551
00:44:06,437 --> 00:44:08,564
Oh, yes, of course, I forgot.
You don't, do you?

552
00:44:08,647 --> 00:44:11,025
Ha! You must.
Nothing else to do down here.

553
00:44:11,108 --> 00:44:13,861
Maxim, when are you going to have
parties here again like the old days?

554
00:44:13,944 --> 00:44:16,739
- I haven't thought about it.
- But everyone's dying to see you and ‒

555
00:44:16,822 --> 00:44:18,490
Yes, I bet they are.

556
00:44:18,574 --> 00:44:21,702
Why don't you have the masquerade ball
again this summer?

557
00:44:21,785 --> 00:44:23,787
- Well ‒
- My dear, are you fond of dancing?

558
00:44:23,871 --> 00:44:26,457
Oh, I love it,
but I'm not very good at it.

559
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,542
- Do you rumba?
- I've never tried.

560
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:29,793
You must teach me.

561
00:44:29,877 --> 00:44:32,379
I say, old boy, I'm trying to find out
exactly what your wife does do.

562
00:44:32,463 --> 00:44:34,798
Well, she sketches a little.

563
00:44:34,882 --> 00:44:36,842
Sketches.
Not this modern stuff, I hope.

564
00:44:36,925 --> 00:44:40,596
Portrait of a lampshade upside-down
to represent a soul in torment.

565
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:43,640
- Don't sail, do you?
- No, I don't.

566
00:44:43,724 --> 00:44:45,559
Well, thank goodness for that.

567
00:44:47,227 --> 00:44:48,479
Huh?

568
00:44:58,697 --> 00:45:00,783
You're very much in love with Maxim,
aren't you?

569
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,702
Yes, I can see you are.

570
00:45:03,786 --> 00:45:06,914
Don't mind my saying so, but why don't you
do something about your hair?

571
00:45:06,997 --> 00:45:10,000
Why don't you have it cut
or sweep it back behind your ears?

572
00:45:12,378 --> 00:45:14,338
Oh, no, that's worse.

573
00:45:14,421 --> 00:45:17,174
What does Maxim say about it?
Does he like it like that?

574
00:45:17,257 --> 00:45:20,636
- Well, he never mentions it.
- Oh, well, don't go by me.

575
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:23,639
I can see by the way you dress,
you don't care a hoot how you look.

576
00:45:23,722 --> 00:45:25,641
But I wonder Maxim
hasn't been at you.

577
00:45:25,724 --> 00:45:27,768
He's so particular about clothes.

578
00:45:27,851 --> 00:45:30,145
I don't think he ever notices
what I wear.

579
00:45:30,229 --> 00:45:34,316
Oh, well, he must have changed a lot then.

580
00:45:36,443 --> 00:45:38,821
You mustn't worry
about old Maxim and his moods.

581
00:45:38,904 --> 00:45:41,740
One never knows what goes on
in that quiet mind of his.

582
00:45:41,824 --> 00:45:46,203
Often he gets into a terrible rage,
and when he does...

583
00:45:46,286 --> 00:45:48,205
But I don't suppose
he'll lose his temper with you.

584
00:45:48,288 --> 00:45:49,748
You seem such a placid little thing.

585
00:45:49,832 --> 00:45:52,084
Come along, old girl.
We've got to be on the first tee at 3:00.

586
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:53,377
All right, I'm coming.

587
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,254
Well, good-bye, Maxim, old boy.

588
00:45:55,337 --> 00:45:57,256
Good-bye, Giles.
Thanks for coming, old boy.

589
00:45:58,132 --> 00:46:01,343
Good-bye, my dear. Forgive me
for asking you so many rude questions.

590
00:46:01,427 --> 00:46:03,679
We both really hope
you'll be very happy.

591
00:46:03,762 --> 00:46:06,098
Oh, thank you, Beatrice.
Thank you very much.

592
00:46:06,181 --> 00:46:08,767
And I must congratulate you
upon the way Maxim looks.

593
00:46:08,851 --> 00:46:11,186
We were very worried about him
this time last year.

594
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:13,981
But then, of course,
you know the whole story.

595
00:46:15,441 --> 00:46:18,402
- Good-bye, Beatrice, darling.
- Good-bye, old boy.

596
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,867
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

597
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:28,829
Well, thank heavens they've gone.
Now we can have a walk about the place.

598
00:46:28,912 --> 00:46:31,373
Looks as though we might have a shower.
But you won't mind that, will you?

599
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:33,125
No, but I'll go get a coat.

600
00:46:33,208 --> 00:46:34,668
There's a heap of mackintoshes
in the flower room.

601
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:38,672
Robert, get a coat from the flower room
for Mrs. de Winter, will you?

602
00:46:38,755 --> 00:46:41,216
- What did you think of Beatrice?
- Oh, I liked her very much.

603
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,219
But she kept saying that I was quite
different from what she expected.

604
00:46:44,303 --> 00:46:45,804
What the devil did she expect?

605
00:46:45,888 --> 00:46:48,807
Someone smarter
and more sophisticated, I'm afraid.

606
00:46:48,891 --> 00:46:50,350
Huh.

607
00:46:50,434 --> 00:46:52,269
Do you like my hair?

608
00:46:52,352 --> 00:46:54,897
Your hair? Yes, of course I do.
What's the matter with it?

609
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:57,232
Oh, I don't know. I just wondered.

610
00:46:57,316 --> 00:46:59,443
How funny you are.

611
00:46:59,526 --> 00:47:00,861
Thank you.

612
00:47:00,944 --> 00:47:02,863
Oh, do I have to put it on?

613
00:47:02,946 --> 00:47:05,657
Yes, certainly, certainly, certainly.
Can't be too careful with children.

614
00:47:05,741 --> 00:47:08,327
Come on, Jasper.
Come take some of that fat off.

615
00:47:17,544 --> 00:47:20,297
Jasper! Here, not that way!
Come here!

616
00:47:22,382 --> 00:47:24,301
Where does that lead to?

617
00:47:24,384 --> 00:47:27,095
It leads to a little cove
where we used to keep a boat.

618
00:47:27,221 --> 00:47:28,722
Oh, let's go down there.

619
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:31,892
No, it's a perfectly dull, uninteresting
stretch of sand, just like any other.

620
00:47:31,975 --> 00:47:35,020
- Oh, please.
- Well, all right.

621
00:47:35,103 --> 00:47:37,940
We'll walk down and take a look,
if you really want to.

622
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,283
That's Jasper.
There must be something wrong.

623
00:47:48,367 --> 00:47:50,285
- Perhaps he's hurt himself.
- No, he's all right. Leave him alone.

624
00:47:50,369 --> 00:47:52,538
- Don't you think I'd better go and see?
- Don't bother about him.

625
00:47:52,621 --> 00:47:54,873
He can't come to any harm.
He'll find his own way back.

626
00:48:03,632 --> 00:48:06,343
Jasper! Jasper!

627
00:48:07,052 --> 00:48:08,720
Oh, there you are.

628
00:48:14,685 --> 00:48:17,354
What do you want in there, Jasper?
Come on. Come on home.

629
00:48:17,437 --> 00:48:19,356
Let's go home, Jasper. Jas ‒

630
00:48:30,325 --> 00:48:31,618
Oh.

631
00:48:32,536 --> 00:48:34,496
I didn't know that there was anybody...

632
00:48:35,414 --> 00:48:38,667
I know that dog.
He comes fr' the house.

633
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,669
He ain't your'n.

634
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:42,671
No, he's Mr. de Winter's dog.

635
00:48:44,047 --> 00:48:46,258
Have you anything I could tie him with?

636
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:21,209
Come on, Jasper.

637
00:49:21,293 --> 00:49:24,921
You won't tell anyone
you saw me in there, will ya?

638
00:49:25,005 --> 00:49:27,049
Don't you belong on the estate?

639
00:49:27,132 --> 00:49:30,719
I weren't doin' nothin'.
I was just puttin' my shells away.

640
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:34,056
She's gone in the sea, ain't she?

641
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:36,600
She'll never come back no more.

642
00:49:37,559 --> 00:49:39,603
No, she'll never come back.

643
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:42,022
Come on, Jasper.

644
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:03,960
Maxim! What's the matter?

645
00:50:04,044 --> 00:50:05,671
Maxim!

646
00:50:07,923 --> 00:50:10,717
I'm sorry I was such a time,
but I had to find a rope for Jasper.

647
00:50:10,801 --> 00:50:14,262
- Hurry up, Jasper, for heaven's sake.
- Please wait for me.

648
00:50:14,346 --> 00:50:16,264
Maxim, what is it?
You look so angry.

649
00:50:16,348 --> 00:50:18,767
You knew I didn't want you to go there,
but you deliberately went.

650
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:21,812
Why not? There was only a cottage
down there and a strange man ‒

651
00:50:21,895 --> 00:50:23,522
You didn't go into the cottage, did you?

652
00:50:23,605 --> 00:50:25,524
- Yes. The door ‒
- Don't go there again! Do you hear?

653
00:50:25,607 --> 00:50:27,526
- Well, why not?
- Because I hate the place.

654
00:50:27,609 --> 00:50:30,278
If you had my memories,
you wouldn't go there or even think about it!

655
00:50:30,362 --> 00:50:32,739
What's the matter?
Oh, I'm sorry. Please.

656
00:50:32,823 --> 00:50:37,577
We should have stayed away.
We should never have come back to Manderley.

657
00:50:39,037 --> 00:50:41,540
Oh, what a fool I was.

658
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:46,211
I've made you unhappy.
Somehow I've hurt you.

659
00:50:46,294 --> 00:50:49,256
Oh, I can't bear to see you like this

660
00:50:49,339 --> 00:50:51,508
because I love you so much.

661
00:50:53,093 --> 00:50:54,553
Do you?

662
00:50:56,346 --> 00:50:57,639
Do you?

663
00:50:59,224 --> 00:51:02,894
I've made you cry. Forgive me.

664
00:51:06,857 --> 00:51:10,444
I sometimes seem to
fly off the handle for no reason at all.

665
00:51:12,404 --> 00:51:13,905
Don't I?

666
00:51:15,323 --> 00:51:19,953
Come, we'll go home and have some tea
and forget all about it.

667
00:51:20,036 --> 00:51:22,497
Yes, let's forget all about it.

668
00:51:22,581 --> 00:51:24,583
Here, let me have Jasper.

669
00:51:53,612 --> 00:51:56,865
- Hello. Come in.
- Oh, please don't get up, Mr. Crawley.

670
00:51:56,948 --> 00:51:59,367
I was just wondering if you meant
what you said the other day

671
00:51:59,451 --> 00:52:01,536
about showing me the run of things?

672
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:04,456
- Of course I did.
- What are you doing now?

673
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:08,460
Notifying all the tenants that,
in celebration of Maxim's return with his bride,

674
00:52:08,543 --> 00:52:10,045
this week's rent will be free.

675
00:52:10,128 --> 00:52:11,713
- Was that Maxim's idea?
- Oh, yes.

676
00:52:11,797 --> 00:52:14,090
All the servants
get an extra week's wages too.

677
00:52:14,174 --> 00:52:16,551
Oh, he didn't tell me.

678
00:52:16,635 --> 00:52:19,846
Can't I help you?
I could at least lick the stamps.

679
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:22,557
That's terribly nice of you.
Won't you sit down?

680
00:52:22,641 --> 00:52:24,601
Oh, yes, thank you.

681
00:52:29,356 --> 00:52:32,901
I... I was down at the cottage
on the beach the other day.

682
00:52:32,984 --> 00:52:35,737
There was a man there ‒
a queer sort of person.

683
00:52:35,821 --> 00:52:39,241
- Jasper kept barking at him.
- Oh, yes. Must've been Ben.

684
00:52:39,324 --> 00:52:43,370
Excuse me. He's quite harmless.
We give him odd jobs now and then.

685
00:52:44,162 --> 00:52:47,082
That cottage place seemed
to be going to rack and ruin.

686
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:48,708
Why isn't something done about it?

687
00:52:48,792 --> 00:52:53,088
Well, I think if Maxim wanted anything
done about it, he'd tell me.

688
00:52:54,256 --> 00:52:56,675
Are those all Rebecca's things
down there?

689
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:01,596
Yes. Yes, they are.

690
00:53:02,556 --> 00:53:04,516
What did she use the cottage for?

691
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:06,935
The boat used to be moored near there.

692
00:53:07,018 --> 00:53:08,603
What boat? What happened to it?

693
00:53:08,687 --> 00:53:12,566
Was that the boat she was sailing in
when she was drowned?

694
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:18,572
Yes. It capsized and sank.
She was washed overboard.

695
00:53:18,655 --> 00:53:21,825
Wasn't she afraid
to go out like that alone?

696
00:53:21,908 --> 00:53:23,910
She wasn't afraid of anything.

697
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:29,332
Where did they find her?

698
00:53:31,251 --> 00:53:34,087
Near Edgecombe,
about 40 miles up channel,

699
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:36,464
about two months afterwards.

700
00:53:36,548 --> 00:53:40,635
Maxim went up to identify her.
It was horrible for him.

701
00:53:41,678 --> 00:53:43,680
Yes, it must have been.

702
00:53:47,392 --> 00:53:51,271
Mr. Crawley, please don't think me
morbidly curious. It isn't that.

703
00:53:51,354 --> 00:53:54,316
It's just that I feel
at such a disadvantage.

704
00:53:54,399 --> 00:53:56,443
All the time, whenever I meet anyone,

705
00:53:56,526 --> 00:53:58,612
Maxim's sister or even the servants,

706
00:53:58,695 --> 00:54:01,281
I know they're all
thinking the same thing.

707
00:54:01,364 --> 00:54:03,950
They're all comparing me
with her, with Rebecca.

708
00:54:04,034 --> 00:54:05,952
Oh, you mustn't think that.

709
00:54:06,036 --> 00:54:08,663
I can't tell you how glad I am
that you've married Maxim.

710
00:54:08,747 --> 00:54:11,124
It's going to make
all the difference to his life.

711
00:54:11,207 --> 00:54:13,752
And from my point of view,
it's very refreshing

712
00:54:13,835 --> 00:54:16,713
to find someone like yourself
who's not entirely in tune,

713
00:54:16,796 --> 00:54:19,132
shall we say, with Manderley.

714
00:54:19,215 --> 00:54:23,178
That's very sweet of you.
I daresay I've been stupid.

715
00:54:23,261 --> 00:54:28,642
But every day I realize
the things that she had and that I lack:

716
00:54:28,725 --> 00:54:31,895
beauty and wit and intelligence

717
00:54:31,978 --> 00:54:35,774
and, oh, all the things
that are so important in a woman.

718
00:54:35,857 --> 00:54:38,193
But you have qualities
that are just as important ‒

719
00:54:38,276 --> 00:54:40,528
more important, if I may say so.

720
00:54:40,612 --> 00:54:42,864
Kindliness and sincerity

721
00:54:42,948 --> 00:54:46,117
and, if you'll forgive me, modesty

722
00:54:46,201 --> 00:54:49,412
mean more to a husband
than all the wit and beauty in the world.

723
00:54:50,538 --> 00:54:54,751
We none of us want to live in the past,
Maxim least of all.

724
00:54:54,834 --> 00:54:58,254
It's up to you, you know,
to lead us away from it.

725
00:54:59,339 --> 00:55:02,300
Well, I promise you
I won't bring this up again.

726
00:55:02,384 --> 00:55:05,428
But before we end this conversation

727
00:55:05,512 --> 00:55:08,223
would you answer
just one more question?

728
00:55:08,306 --> 00:55:12,268
If it's something I'm able to answer,
I'll do my best.

729
00:55:13,853 --> 00:55:17,190
Tell me, what was Rebecca really like?

730
00:55:26,324 --> 00:55:28,201
I suppose...

731
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:33,331
I suppose she was the most
beautiful creature I ever saw.

732
00:56:05,864 --> 00:56:07,574
- Good evening, Maxim.
- Hello.

733
00:56:07,657 --> 00:56:10,285
The films of the honeymoon
have arrived at last.

734
00:56:10,368 --> 00:56:13,038
Have we time, do you think,
before dinner?

735
00:56:16,124 --> 00:56:18,209
What on earth
have you done to yourself?

736
00:56:18,293 --> 00:56:22,380
Oh, nothing. I just ordered a new dress
from London. I hope you don't mind.

737
00:56:22,464 --> 00:56:26,634
Oh, no. Only do you think that
sort of thing is right for you?

738
00:56:26,718 --> 00:56:29,846
- It doesn't seem your type at all.
- I thought you'd like it.

739
00:56:29,929 --> 00:56:32,098
And what have you done to your hair?

740
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:35,226
Oh, I see.

741
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:37,812
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.
I'm sorry.

742
00:56:37,896 --> 00:56:39,856
You look lovely, lovely.

743
00:56:39,939 --> 00:56:42,859
That's very nice for a change.

744
00:56:44,903 --> 00:56:46,905
Shall we see these pictures?

745
00:56:46,988 --> 00:56:48,948
Yes, I'd love to see them.

746
00:56:56,539 --> 00:56:59,542
Ah, look, now. Look at that.

747
00:56:59,626 --> 00:57:02,212
Wasn't it wonderful, darling?
Can't we go back there someday?

748
00:57:02,295 --> 00:57:05,340
Yes, of course, of course.
Ah, look at you. There.

749
00:57:05,423 --> 00:57:08,927
Won't our grandchildren be delighted
when they see how lovely you were?

750
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:10,178
Oh, look at you! Yes!

751
00:57:10,261 --> 00:57:13,807
Oh, I like that.

752
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:16,059
Look at that.

753
00:57:16,142 --> 00:57:17,352
Oh, yes, very nice.

754
00:57:17,435 --> 00:57:18,978
- Oh, remember that?
- Yes.

755
00:57:19,062 --> 00:57:21,815
Oh, I wish our honeymoon could
have lasted forever, Maxim.

756
00:57:21,898 --> 00:57:23,817
Oh, dash it! Look. Oh.

757
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:26,111
Oh.... Oh, hang it.

758
00:57:26,903 --> 00:57:29,572
Threaded it up wrong,
as usual, or something.

759
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:34,786
- Yes, Frith, what is it?
- Excuse me, sir.

760
00:57:34,869 --> 00:57:36,871
May I have a word with you?

761
00:57:37,831 --> 00:57:40,375
Yes. Come in.

762
00:57:40,458 --> 00:57:42,377
It's about Robert, sir.

763
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:45,713
There's been a slight unpleasantness
between him and Mrs. Danvers.

764
00:57:45,797 --> 00:57:47,882
- Oh, dear.
- Robert is very upset.

765
00:57:47,966 --> 00:57:50,051
This is trouble. What is it?

766
00:57:50,135 --> 00:57:52,053
It appears that Mrs. Danvers
has accused Robert

767
00:57:52,137 --> 00:57:54,556
of stealing a valuable ornament
from the morning room.

768
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:57,475
Robert denies the accusation
most emphatically, sir.

769
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,521
- What was the thing, anyway?
- The china cupid, sir.

770
00:58:01,604 --> 00:58:04,524
Oh, dear.
That's one of our treasures, isn't it?

771
00:58:04,607 --> 00:58:06,651
Well, tell Mrs. Danvers to get
to the bottom of it somehow.

772
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:08,820
- And tell her I'm sure it wasn't Robert.
- Very good, sir.

773
00:58:08,903 --> 00:58:12,740
Why do they come to me with these things?
That's your job, sweetheart.

774
00:58:12,824 --> 00:58:16,494
Maxim, I wanted to tell you,
but, um, well, I forgot.

775
00:58:18,163 --> 00:58:22,333
- The fact is, I broke the china cupid.
- You broke it?

776
00:58:22,417 --> 00:58:25,587
Now, why on earth didn't you say
something about it when Frith was here?

777
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:29,549
I don't know. I didn't like to.
I was afraid he'd think me a fool.

778
00:58:29,632 --> 00:58:33,428
Well, he'll think you much more a fool now.
You'll have to explain to him and Mrs. Danvers.

779
00:58:33,511 --> 00:58:36,431
- Oh, no, you do it. I'll go upstairs.
- Don't be such a little idiot.

780
00:58:36,514 --> 00:58:38,975
Anybody would think
you were afraid of them.

781
00:58:39,934 --> 00:58:41,519
It was all a mistake, Mrs. Danvers.

782
00:58:41,603 --> 00:58:44,981
Apparently, Mrs. de Winter broke the cupid
herself and forgot to say anything about it.

783
00:58:45,982 --> 00:58:49,903
I'm so sorry. I ‒ I never thought
that I'd get Robert into trouble.

784
00:58:49,986 --> 00:58:52,572
Is it possible to repair
the ornament, madam?

785
00:58:52,655 --> 00:58:56,576
No, I'm afraid it isn't.
It was smashed into pieces.

786
00:58:56,659 --> 00:58:58,661
What did you do with the pieces?

787
00:59:00,163 --> 00:59:03,791
Well, I-I put them at the back of one
of the drawers in the writing desk.

788
00:59:03,875 --> 00:59:07,212
Well, it looks as though Mrs. de Winter
were afraid you were going to put her in prison,

789
00:59:07,295 --> 00:59:08,630
doesn't it, Mrs. Danvers?

790
00:59:08,713 --> 00:59:09,714
Well, never mind.

791
00:59:09,797 --> 00:59:12,008
Do what you can to find the pieces,
see if they can be mended,

792
00:59:12,091 --> 00:59:14,177
and above all tell Robert to dry his tears.

793
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:16,304
I shall apologize
to Robert, of course.

794
00:59:16,387 --> 00:59:19,766
Perhaps if such a thing happens again,
Mrs. de Winter will tell me personally ‒

795
00:59:19,849 --> 00:59:22,518
Yes, yes, all right.
Thank you, Mrs. Danvers.

796
00:59:27,106 --> 00:59:30,401
Well, I suppose that clip
will hold all right. I don't know.

797
00:59:35,198 --> 00:59:38,868
I'm awfully sorry, darling.
It was very careless of me.

798
00:59:38,952 --> 00:59:41,120
Mrs. Danvers
must be furious with me.

799
00:59:41,204 --> 00:59:44,290
Oh, hang Mrs. Danvers. Why on earth
should you be frightened of her?

800
00:59:44,374 --> 00:59:48,753
You behave more like an upstairs maid,
not like the mistress of the house at all.

801
00:59:48,836 --> 00:59:52,298
Yes, I know I do.
But I feel so uncomfortable.

802
00:59:52,382 --> 00:59:56,094
I... I try my best every day,
but it's very difficult

803
00:59:56,177 --> 01:00:00,223
with people looking me up and down
as if I were a prize cow.

804
01:00:00,306 --> 01:00:02,183
What does it matter if they do?

805
01:00:02,267 --> 01:00:06,229
You must remember that life at Manderley is
the only thing that interests anybody down here.

806
01:00:06,312 --> 01:00:09,357
What a slap in the eye
I must have been to them, then.

807
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,693
I suppose that's why you married me.

808
01:00:11,776 --> 01:00:14,696
Because you knew I was dull
and gauche and inexperienced

809
01:00:14,779 --> 01:00:18,366
and there could never be
any gossip about me.

810
01:00:18,449 --> 01:00:20,702
Gossip? What do you mean?

811
01:00:20,785 --> 01:00:23,955
I-I don't know.
I just said it for something to say.

812
01:00:24,038 --> 01:00:26,457
Don't look at me like that.

813
01:00:26,541 --> 01:00:30,336
Maxim, what's the matter?
What have I said?

814
01:00:36,968 --> 01:00:39,679
It wasn't a very attractive
thing to say, was it?

815
01:00:39,762 --> 01:00:43,266
No. It was rude, hateful.

816
01:00:48,104 --> 01:00:51,065
I wonder if I did a very selfish thing
in marrying you.

817
01:00:51,149 --> 01:00:53,276
How do you mean?

818
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:55,695
I'm not much of a companion
to you, am I?

819
01:00:56,863 --> 01:00:59,198
You don't get much fun, do you?

820
01:01:00,283 --> 01:01:03,536
You ought to have married a boy,
someone of your own age.

821
01:01:03,619 --> 01:01:07,498
Maxim, why do you say this?
Of course we're companions.

822
01:01:07,582 --> 01:01:10,460
Are we? I don't know.

823
01:01:12,045 --> 01:01:13,463
I'm very difficult to live with.

824
01:01:13,546 --> 01:01:16,507
No, you're not difficult.
You're easy, very easy.

825
01:01:16,591 --> 01:01:19,886
Our marriage is a success, isn't it?
A great success?

826
01:01:19,969 --> 01:01:23,056
We're happy, aren't we?
Terribly happy.

827
01:01:30,646 --> 01:01:33,649
If you don't think we are happy,

828
01:01:33,733 --> 01:01:36,486
it would be much better
if you didn't pretend.

829
01:01:37,653 --> 01:01:39,864
I'll go away.

830
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:44,744
Why don't you answer me?

831
01:01:47,205 --> 01:01:51,417
How can I answer you
when I don't know the answer myself?

832
01:01:53,503 --> 01:01:56,381
If you say we're happy,
let's leave it at that.

833
01:01:57,256 --> 01:01:59,926
Happiness is something
I know nothing about.

834
01:02:05,973 --> 01:02:08,142
Oh, look, there's the one

835
01:02:08,226 --> 01:02:11,270
when I left the camera running
on the tripod, remember?

836
01:03:04,157 --> 01:03:07,410
Pardon me, madam.
Is there anything I can do for you?

837
01:03:07,493 --> 01:03:09,871
I'm all right, Hilda.
Thank you very much.

838
01:03:09,954 --> 01:03:12,582
I'll bring the sandwiches
immediately, madam.

839
01:03:37,315 --> 01:03:39,692
- Hilda.
- Yes, madam?

840
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:44,280
The west wing ‒
Nobody ever uses it anymore, do they?

841
01:03:44,363 --> 01:03:47,700
No, madam.
Not since the death of Mrs. de Winter.

842
01:04:09,305 --> 01:04:11,974
Come along, Mr. Jack,
or someone may see you.

843
01:04:12,058 --> 01:04:15,019
Well, Danny, old harpy,
it's been good to see you again.

844
01:04:15,102 --> 01:04:18,105
Been simply breathless to pick up all the news.

845
01:04:18,189 --> 01:04:21,192
I don't think it's
wise for you to come here, Mr. Jack.

846
01:04:21,275 --> 01:04:24,195
- Jasper, come here.
- Nonsense. It's just like coming back home.

847
01:04:24,278 --> 01:04:25,696
Quiet, Mr. Jack.

848
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:28,616
Yes, and we must be careful
not to shock Cinderella, mustn't we?

849
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:29,992
She's in the morning room.

850
01:04:30,076 --> 01:04:32,161
If you leave through the garden door,
she won't see you.

851
01:04:32,245 --> 01:04:34,497
I must say
I feel a little like the poor relation,

852
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:36,916
sneaking around through back doors.

853
01:04:36,999 --> 01:04:41,420
- Well, toodle-oo, Danny.
- Good-bye, Mr. Jack, and please be careful.

854
01:04:43,548 --> 01:04:45,383
Jasper, quiet.

855
01:04:47,426 --> 01:04:50,846
Looking for me?
Oh, I didn't make you jump, did I?

856
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:53,891
No, of course not.
I didn't quite know who it was.

857
01:04:53,975 --> 01:04:56,435
Yes.

858
01:04:56,519 --> 01:04:58,688
You're pleased to see me,
aren't you, old boy?

859
01:04:58,771 --> 01:05:02,942
I'm glad there's someone in the family
to welcome me back to Manderley.

860
01:05:04,235 --> 01:05:07,488
And, um, how is dear old Max?

861
01:05:07,572 --> 01:05:09,824
Very well, thank you.

862
01:05:09,907 --> 01:05:13,661
I hear he went up to London,
left his little bride all alone.

863
01:05:13,744 --> 01:05:15,663
That's too bad.

864
01:05:15,746 --> 01:05:19,500
Isn't he rather afraid that somebody
might come down and carry you off?

865
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:24,505
Danny, all your precautions
were in vain.

866
01:05:24,589 --> 01:05:27,425
The mistress of the house
was hiding behind the door.

867
01:05:29,927 --> 01:05:33,556
Oh, what about presenting me
to the bride?

868
01:05:33,639 --> 01:05:37,476
- This is Mr. Favell, madam.
- How do you do?

869
01:05:38,853 --> 01:05:40,855
How do you do?

870
01:05:42,398 --> 01:05:44,775
Won't you have some tea or something?

871
01:05:44,859 --> 01:05:46,944
Now, isn't that a charming invitation?

872
01:05:47,028 --> 01:05:50,740
I've been asked to stay to tea, Danny,
and I've a good mind to accept.

873
01:05:50,823 --> 01:05:54,952
Oh, well, perhaps you're right.
Pity, just when we were getting on so nicely.

874
01:05:55,036 --> 01:05:58,331
We mustn't lead the young bride astray,
must we, Jasper?

875
01:05:58,414 --> 01:06:01,626
Good-bye.
It's been fun meeting you.

876
01:06:01,709 --> 01:06:04,962
Oh, and by the way,
it would be very decent of you

877
01:06:05,046 --> 01:06:08,257
if you didn't mention this little visit
to your revered husband.

878
01:06:08,341 --> 01:06:11,177
He doesn't exactly approve of me.

879
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:14,347
- Very well.
- That's very sporting of you.

880
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:18,351
I wish I had a young bride of three months
waiting for me at home.

881
01:06:18,434 --> 01:06:21,771
I'm just a lonely old bachelor.

882
01:06:21,854 --> 01:06:24,148
Fare thee well.

883
01:06:24,231 --> 01:06:27,318
Oh, and I know what was wrong
with that introduction.

884
01:06:27,401 --> 01:06:29,654
Danny didn't tell you, did she?

885
01:06:29,737 --> 01:06:31,781
I am Rebecca's favorite cousin.

886
01:06:34,033 --> 01:06:36,118
Toodle-oo.

887
01:08:33,444 --> 01:08:35,070
Do you wish anything, madam?

888
01:08:42,244 --> 01:08:44,246
I didn't expect to see you,
Mrs. Danvers.

889
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:48,125
I noticed a window wasn't closed,
and I came up to see if I could fasten it.

890
01:08:48,209 --> 01:08:51,837
Why did you say that?
I closed it before I left the room.

891
01:08:51,921 --> 01:08:54,131
You opened it yourself, didn't you?

892
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:59,011
You've always wanted to see this room,
haven't you, madam?

893
01:08:59,094 --> 01:09:01,347
Why did you never ask me
to show it to you?

894
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:04,391
I was ready to show it to you every day.

895
01:09:08,854 --> 01:09:11,273
It's a lovely room, isn't it?

896
01:09:11,357 --> 01:09:13,400
The loveliest room you've ever seen.

897
01:09:13,484 --> 01:09:16,445
Everything is kept
just as Mrs. de Winter liked it.

898
01:09:16,529 --> 01:09:18,864
Nothing has been altered
since that last night.

899
01:09:18,948 --> 01:09:22,576
Come. I'll show you
her dressing room.

900
01:09:24,453 --> 01:09:26,997
This is where I keep all her clothes.

901
01:09:28,666 --> 01:09:31,919
You would like to see them,
wouldn't you?

902
01:09:42,972 --> 01:09:44,431
Feel this.

903
01:09:45,975 --> 01:09:48,477
It was a Christmas present
from Mr. de Winter.

904
01:09:51,438 --> 01:09:55,234
He was always giving her expensive gifts,
the whole year round.

905
01:09:57,444 --> 01:10:00,155
I keep her underwear on this side.

906
01:10:02,116 --> 01:10:06,036
They were made specially for her
by the nuns in the Convent of St. Claire.

907
01:10:09,707 --> 01:10:12,877
I always used to wait up for her,
no matter how late.

908
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:16,213
Sometimes she and Mr. de Winter
didn't come home until dawn.

909
01:10:19,425 --> 01:10:22,803
While she was undressing,
she'd tell me about the party she'd been to.

910
01:10:22,887 --> 01:10:25,180
She knew everyone that mattered,

911
01:10:25,264 --> 01:10:26,932
and everyone loved her.

912
01:10:29,476 --> 01:10:31,687
When she'd finished her bath,

913
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:35,524
she'd go into the bedroom
and go over to the dressing table.

914
01:10:45,784 --> 01:10:47,912
Oh, you've moved her brush,
haven't you?

915
01:10:47,995 --> 01:10:51,373
There, that's better ‒
just as she always laid it down.

916
01:10:51,457 --> 01:10:53,667
"Come on, Danny, hair drill,"
she would say.

917
01:10:53,751 --> 01:10:58,005
I'd stand behind her like this
and brush away for 20 minutes at a time.

918
01:10:59,506 --> 01:11:02,009
And then she would say,

919
01:11:02,092 --> 01:11:05,429
"Good night, Danny,"
and step into her bed.

920
01:11:13,979 --> 01:11:16,273
I embroidered this case
for her myself,

921
01:11:16,357 --> 01:11:18,692
and I keep it here always.

922
01:11:26,617 --> 01:11:29,536
Did you ever see anything so delicate?

923
01:11:42,549 --> 01:11:46,178
Look.
You can see my hand through it.

924
01:12:07,908 --> 01:12:11,495
You wouldn't think she'd
been gone so long, would you?

925
01:12:11,578 --> 01:12:14,581
Sometimes when I walk
along the corridor,

926
01:12:14,665 --> 01:12:17,209
I fancy I hear her just behind me.

927
01:12:17,292 --> 01:12:21,338
That quick, light step.
I couldn't mistake it anywhere.

928
01:12:21,422 --> 01:12:26,176
It's not only in this room.
It's in all the rooms in the house.

929
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:28,679
I can almost hear it now.

930
01:12:30,597 --> 01:12:33,434
Do you think the dead
come back and watch the living?

931
01:12:33,517 --> 01:12:36,353
No, I don't believe it.

932
01:12:36,437 --> 01:12:41,358
Sometimes I wonder if she doesn't
come back here to Manderley

933
01:12:41,442 --> 01:12:44,611
and watch you
and Mr. de Winter together.

934
01:12:46,905 --> 01:12:51,952
You look tired. Why don't you
stay here a while and rest

935
01:12:52,036 --> 01:12:54,621
and listen to the sea?

936
01:12:56,123 --> 01:12:58,792
It's so soothing.

937
01:13:00,419 --> 01:13:02,337
Listen to it.

938
01:13:05,924 --> 01:13:07,843
Listen.

939
01:13:09,928 --> 01:13:12,097
Listen to the sea.

940
01:13:40,501 --> 01:13:43,837
Tell Mrs. Danvers
I wish to see her immediately.

941
01:14:10,656 --> 01:14:13,283
You sent for me, madam?

942
01:14:13,367 --> 01:14:15,577
Yes, Mrs. Danvers.

943
01:14:15,661 --> 01:14:18,247
I want you to get rid
of all these things.

944
01:14:18,330 --> 01:14:20,290
These are Mrs. de Winter's things.

945
01:14:21,041 --> 01:14:23,627
I am Mrs. de Winter now.

946
01:14:25,254 --> 01:14:26,755
Very well.
I'll give the instructions.

947
01:14:30,217 --> 01:14:32,803
Just a moment, please.

948
01:14:35,305 --> 01:14:41,145
Mrs. Danvers, I intend to say nothing to
Mr. de Winter about Mr. Favell's visit.

949
01:14:41,228 --> 01:14:44,898
In fact, I'd prefer to forget everything
that happened this afternoon.

950
01:14:53,532 --> 01:14:56,118
Oh, Maxim, Maxim,
you've been gone all day!

951
01:14:56,201 --> 01:14:59,163
You're choking me.
Well. Well, well, well.

952
01:14:59,246 --> 01:15:02,040
- What have you been doing with yourself?
- Oh, I've been thinking.

953
01:15:02,124 --> 01:15:05,878
- What do you want to do that for?
- Come in here and I'll tell you.

954
01:15:07,087 --> 01:15:11,466
Darling, could we have a costume ball
just as you used to?

955
01:15:13,177 --> 01:15:15,762
Now, what put that into your mind?

956
01:15:15,846 --> 01:15:17,222
Has Beatrice been at you?

957
01:15:17,306 --> 01:15:19,892
No, no, but I feel that
we ought to do something

958
01:15:19,975 --> 01:15:23,645
to make people feel that Manderley
is just the same as it always was.

959
01:15:25,522 --> 01:15:28,108
Oh, please, darling, could we?

960
01:15:30,527 --> 01:15:32,779
You don't know
what it would mean, you know.

961
01:15:32,863 --> 01:15:36,700
You would have to be hostess
to hundreds of people, all the county.

962
01:15:36,783 --> 01:15:40,454
And a lot of young people would come up from
London and turn the house into a nightclub.

963
01:15:40,537 --> 01:15:42,748
Oh, yes, but I want to. Oh, please.

964
01:15:42,831 --> 01:15:45,751
I've never been to a large party,
but I could learn what to do.

965
01:15:45,834 --> 01:15:48,795
And I promise you,
you wouldn't be ashamed of me.

966
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:58,805
All right, if you think you'd enjoy it.

967
01:15:58,889 --> 01:16:01,308
You'd better get Mrs. Danvers
to help you, hadn't you?

968
01:16:01,391 --> 01:16:03,810
No, no. I don't need
Mrs. Danvers to help me.

969
01:16:03,894 --> 01:16:06,188
- I can do it myself.
- All right, my sweet.

970
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:09,233
Oh, thank you, darling.
Thank you.

971
01:16:09,316 --> 01:16:12,736
- Oh, what'll you go as?
- Oh, I never dress up.

972
01:16:12,819 --> 01:16:15,155
That's the one privilege
I claim as the host.

973
01:16:15,239 --> 01:16:18,158
What will you be? Alice in Wonderland
with that ribbon around your hair?

974
01:16:18,242 --> 01:16:22,246
I won't tell. I'll design my costume all by myself
and give you the surprise of your life.

975
01:16:38,053 --> 01:16:40,764
Come in.

976
01:16:45,018 --> 01:16:47,604
Robert found these sketches
in the library, madam.

977
01:16:47,688 --> 01:16:50,274
- Did you intend throwing them away?
- Yes, Mrs. Danvers, I did.

978
01:16:50,357 --> 01:16:53,819
They were just some ideas I was
sketching for my costume for the ball.

979
01:16:53,902 --> 01:16:55,988
Hasn't Mr. de Winter
suggested anything?

980
01:16:56,071 --> 01:16:58,907
No, I want to surprise him.
I don't want him to know anything about it.

981
01:16:58,991 --> 01:17:01,910
I merely thought
that you might find a costume

982
01:17:01,994 --> 01:17:04,204
among the family portraits
that would suit you.

983
01:17:04,288 --> 01:17:07,749
Oh, you mean those at the top of the stairs?
I'll go and look at them.

984
01:17:15,215 --> 01:17:18,802
This one, for instance.
It might have been designed for you.

985
01:17:18,885 --> 01:17:21,138
I'm sure you could have it copied.

986
01:17:21,221 --> 01:17:25,309
I've heard Mr. de Winter say that
this is his favorite of all the paintings.

987
01:17:25,392 --> 01:17:28,395
It's Lady Caroline de Winter,
one of his ancestors.

988
01:17:28,478 --> 01:17:33,233
Oh, well, well, that's a splendid idea,
Mrs. Danvers. I'm-I'm very grateful.

989
01:18:00,385 --> 01:18:03,472
- Everything under control, Frith?
- Yes, sir. Thank you.

990
01:18:03,555 --> 01:18:07,267
Excuse me, sir.
Are you supposed to be a schoolmaster?

991
01:18:07,351 --> 01:18:09,770
Oh, no, this is just
my old cap and gown.

992
01:18:09,853 --> 01:18:13,607
Certainly makes a very nice costume, sir,
and economical too.

993
01:18:14,649 --> 01:18:16,693
Uh, yes. That was the idea.

994
01:18:27,329 --> 01:18:29,706
Evening, Robert.
Not very good weather for the ball.

995
01:18:29,790 --> 01:18:33,335
- No, sir.
- Very misty on the way and very chilly.

996
01:18:34,169 --> 01:18:37,005
Oh, this wig's so tight, they ought
to have sent an aspirin with it.

997
01:18:37,089 --> 01:18:39,716
Hello. What's the idea?
Adam and Eve?

998
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:42,677
- Oh, Maxim, don't be disgusting.
- Strong man, old man.

999
01:18:42,761 --> 01:18:44,846
- Where's my weight thing?
- What thing?

1000
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:47,557
- You haven't left it in the car?
- Oh, no, there it is.

1001
01:18:48,975 --> 01:18:51,019
Are you the first one down?
Where's the child?

1002
01:18:51,103 --> 01:18:53,814
She's keeping her costume a terrific secret.
Wouldn't let me into her room.

1003
01:18:53,897 --> 01:18:55,899
Oh, lovely.

1004
01:18:56,983 --> 01:18:58,819
I'll go up and give her a hand.

1005
01:18:58,902 --> 01:19:01,655
- I could do with a drink.
- Won't you catch cold in that thing?

1006
01:19:01,738 --> 01:19:04,408
Don't be silly. Pure wool, old boy.

1007
01:19:06,118 --> 01:19:08,453
Pardon me, sir. You forgot this.

1008
01:19:08,537 --> 01:19:10,288
Oh, thank you.

1009
01:19:14,668 --> 01:19:17,421
Here I am, dear. It's Bea.
I've come to give you a hand.

1010
01:19:17,504 --> 01:19:20,924
Oh, please don't come in, Beatrice.
I don't want anyone to see my costume.

1011
01:19:21,007 --> 01:19:23,552
Oh. Oh, well,
you won't be long, will you?

1012
01:19:23,635 --> 01:19:27,139
Because the first people
will be arriving any moment.

1013
01:19:27,222 --> 01:19:29,683
- Now, you're sure that's where that should be?
- Yes, madam, it's just right.

1014
01:19:29,766 --> 01:19:32,060
- Oh, isn't this exciting?
- Indeed it is, madam.

1015
01:19:32,144 --> 01:19:35,063
I've always heard of the Manderley Ball.
Now I'm really going to see one.

1016
01:19:35,147 --> 01:19:37,691
I'm sure there'll be no one there
to touch you, madam.

1017
01:19:37,774 --> 01:19:40,444
Do you really think so?
Now, where's my fan?

1018
01:19:40,527 --> 01:19:43,113
Now, you're sure
I look all right?

1019
01:19:43,196 --> 01:19:45,532
You look ever so beautiful.

1020
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:49,953
Well, here goes.

1021
01:20:50,597 --> 01:20:53,016
Good evening, Mr. de Winter.

1022
01:20:59,314 --> 01:21:01,316
What the devil do you think you're doing?

1023
01:21:01,399 --> 01:21:03,318
Rebecca! Oh.

1024
01:21:03,401 --> 01:21:07,239
But i-it's the picture,
the one in the gallery.

1025
01:21:09,741 --> 01:21:12,160
What is it? What have I done?

1026
01:21:12,244 --> 01:21:15,205
Go and take it off. It doesn't matter
what you put on. Anything will do.

1027
01:21:17,958 --> 01:21:20,961
What are you standing there for?
Didn't you hear what I said?

1028
01:21:22,587 --> 01:21:24,047
Sir George and Lady Moore.

1029
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:26,967
Dudley Tennant.
Admiral and Lady Burbank.

1030
01:21:47,612 --> 01:21:51,283
I watched you go down
just as I watched her a year ago.

1031
01:21:51,366 --> 01:21:53,702
Even in the same dress,
you couldn't compare.

1032
01:21:53,785 --> 01:21:58,623
You knew it! You knew that she wore it,
and yet you deliberately suggested I wear it.

1033
01:21:58,707 --> 01:22:01,751
Why do you hate me? What have I done
to you that you should ever hate me so?

1034
01:22:01,835 --> 01:22:03,837
You tried to take her place.
You let him marry you.

1035
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:08,091
I've seen his face, his eyes. They're the same
as those first weeks after she died.

1036
01:22:08,925 --> 01:22:11,511
I used to listen to him
walking up and down, up and down,

1037
01:22:11,595 --> 01:22:13,305
all night long, night after night,

1038
01:22:13,388 --> 01:22:16,016
thinking of her, suffering torture
because he'd lost her.

1039
01:22:17,601 --> 01:22:20,353
I don't want to know.
I don't want to know.

1040
01:22:20,437 --> 01:22:22,105
You thought you could be
Mrs. de Winter,

1041
01:22:22,188 --> 01:22:25,108
live in her house, walk in her steps,
take the things that were hers.

1042
01:22:25,191 --> 01:22:27,819
But she's too strong for you.
You can't fight her.

1043
01:22:27,902 --> 01:22:30,488
No one ever got the better of her,
never, never.

1044
01:22:30,572 --> 01:22:33,783
She was beaten in the end,
but it wasn't a man, it wasn't a woman.

1045
01:22:33,867 --> 01:22:35,243
It was the sea!

1046
01:22:35,327 --> 01:22:37,996
Oh, stop it, stop it. Oh, stop it.

1047
01:22:58,099 --> 01:23:02,103
You're overwrought, madam.
I've opened a window for you.

1048
01:23:02,187 --> 01:23:04,856
A little air will do you good.

1049
01:23:18,203 --> 01:23:22,374
Why don't you go?
Why don't you leave Manderley?

1050
01:23:22,457 --> 01:23:25,001
He doesn't need you.

1051
01:23:25,085 --> 01:23:27,379
He's got his memories.

1052
01:23:27,462 --> 01:23:30,548
He doesn't love you.
He wants to be alone again with her.

1053
01:23:32,217 --> 01:23:34,219
You've nothing to stay for.

1054
01:23:35,303 --> 01:23:37,681
You've nothing to live for,
really, have you?

1055
01:23:38,765 --> 01:23:42,102
Look down there.
It's easy, isn't it?

1056
01:23:43,812 --> 01:23:45,689
Why don't you?

1057
01:23:46,648 --> 01:23:47,857
Why don't you?

1058
01:23:49,442 --> 01:23:51,152
Go on.

1059
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:53,822
Go on.

1060
01:23:54,739 --> 01:23:56,616
Don't be afraid.

1061
01:24:07,001 --> 01:24:09,462
Shipwreck! Ship on the rocks!

1062
01:24:09,546 --> 01:24:11,214
It's a ship aground,
sending up rockets.

1063
01:24:11,297 --> 01:24:15,510
Shipwreck! Come on, everybody, down
to the bay! Notify the Coast Guard!

1064
01:24:15,593 --> 01:24:17,637
Oh, Maxim! Maxim!

1065
01:24:17,721 --> 01:24:21,057
- Ship ashore!
- Come on, come on! Everybody!

1066
01:24:21,141 --> 01:24:22,976
Maxim! Maxim!

1067
01:24:48,209 --> 01:24:49,669
Oh!

1068
01:24:52,672 --> 01:24:56,009
Ben, have you seen
Mr. de Winter anywhere?

1069
01:24:56,092 --> 01:25:00,054
She won't come back, will she?
You said so.

1070
01:25:00,138 --> 01:25:02,182
Who, Ben? What do you mean?

1071
01:25:02,265 --> 01:25:04,768
Uh, the other one.

1072
01:25:17,864 --> 01:25:20,450
Oh, Frank, have you seen Maxim anywhere?

1073
01:25:20,533 --> 01:25:23,745
Not since about half an hour ago.
I thought he'd gone up to the house.

1074
01:25:23,828 --> 01:25:25,580
No, he hasn't been to the house at all,

1075
01:25:25,663 --> 01:25:28,249
and I'm afraid something
might have happened to him.

1076
01:25:28,333 --> 01:25:31,044
Frank, what's the matter?
Is anything wrong?

1077
01:25:31,127 --> 01:25:33,588
There is something wrong.

1078
01:25:33,671 --> 01:25:37,383
Well, the diver who went down
to inspect the bottom of the ship

1079
01:25:37,467 --> 01:25:39,511
came across the hull of another boat ‒

1080
01:25:39,594 --> 01:25:41,596
a little sailboat.

1081
01:25:42,764 --> 01:25:46,351
- Frank, is it ‒
- Yes, it's Rebecca's.

1082
01:25:48,853 --> 01:25:50,939
How did they recognize it?

1083
01:25:51,022 --> 01:25:53,942
He's a local man.
Knew it instantly.

1084
01:25:54,025 --> 01:25:56,945
It'll be so hard on poor Maxim.

1085
01:25:57,028 --> 01:25:59,989
Yes, it's going to bring it
all back again,

1086
01:26:00,073 --> 01:26:01,741
and worse than before.

1087
01:26:03,827 --> 01:26:06,120
Why did they have to find it?

1088
01:26:06,204 --> 01:26:10,250
Why couldn't they have left it there
in peace, at the bottom of the sea?

1089
01:26:11,876 --> 01:26:15,797
Well, I'd better get along
and arrange some breakfast for the men.

1090
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:19,259
All right, Frank.
I'll go and look for Maxim.

1091
01:26:55,003 --> 01:26:57,964
- Hello.
- Maxim.

1092
01:26:58,965 --> 01:27:00,967
You haven't had any sleep.

1093
01:27:02,594 --> 01:27:04,387
Have you forgiven me?

1094
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:08,016
Forgiven you?
What have I got to forgive you for?

1095
01:27:08,099 --> 01:27:12,186
For last night,
my stupidity about the costume.

1096
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:16,357
Oh, that. I'd forgotten.

1097
01:27:16,441 --> 01:27:18,359
I was angry with you, wasn't I?

1098
01:27:18,443 --> 01:27:19,777
Mmm.

1099
01:27:22,697 --> 01:27:25,491
Maxim, can't we start all over again?

1100
01:27:25,575 --> 01:27:29,704
I don't ask that you should love me.
I won't ask impossible things.

1101
01:27:29,787 --> 01:27:32,415
I'll be your friend, your companion.

1102
01:27:32,498 --> 01:27:34,959
I'll be happy with that.

1103
01:27:40,882 --> 01:27:43,718
You love me very much, don't you?

1104
01:27:47,847 --> 01:27:50,350
But it's too late, my darling.

1105
01:27:52,185 --> 01:27:54,938
We've lost our little
chance of happiness.

1106
01:27:55,021 --> 01:27:59,025
- No, Maxim, no.
- Yes. It's all over now.

1107
01:28:00,693 --> 01:28:03,071
The thing's happened.

1108
01:28:03,154 --> 01:28:06,324
The thing I've dreaded day after day,

1109
01:28:06,407 --> 01:28:08,368
night after night.

1110
01:28:08,451 --> 01:28:11,162
Maxim, what are you trying to tell me?

1111
01:28:12,705 --> 01:28:15,500
Rebecca has won.

1112
01:28:17,543 --> 01:28:20,672
Her shadow has been
between us all the time,

1113
01:28:20,755 --> 01:28:22,799
keeping us from one another.

1114
01:28:24,175 --> 01:28:26,970
She knew that this would happen.

1115
01:28:27,053 --> 01:28:29,430
What are you saying?

1116
01:28:29,514 --> 01:28:33,810
They sent a diver down.
He found another boat.

1117
01:28:33,893 --> 01:28:37,313
Yes, I know. Frank told me.
Rebecca's boat.

1118
01:28:37,397 --> 01:28:40,650
Oh, it's terrible for you.
I'm so sorry.

1119
01:28:40,733 --> 01:28:43,486
The diver made another discovery.

1120
01:28:43,569 --> 01:28:46,698
He broke one of the ports
and looked into the cabin.

1121
01:28:48,074 --> 01:28:50,326
There was a body in there.

1122
01:28:50,410 --> 01:28:52,578
Then she wasn't alone.

1123
01:28:52,662 --> 01:28:55,832
There was someone sailing with her,
and you have to find out who it was.

1124
01:28:55,915 --> 01:28:59,711
- That's it, isn't it, Maxim?
- You don't understand.

1125
01:28:59,794 --> 01:29:01,671
There was no one with her.

1126
01:29:02,964 --> 01:29:06,009
It's Rebecca's body
lying there on the cabin floor.

1127
01:29:07,552 --> 01:29:09,846
Oh, no.

1128
01:29:09,929 --> 01:29:12,765
The woman that was washed up
at Edgecombe,

1129
01:29:12,849 --> 01:29:16,019
the woman that is now buried
in the family crypt,

1130
01:29:16,102 --> 01:29:18,396
that was not Rebecca.

1131
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:21,649
That was the body
of some unknown woman,

1132
01:29:21,733 --> 01:29:25,361
unclaimed, belonging nowhere.

1133
01:29:26,529 --> 01:29:29,991
I identified it,
but I knew it wasn't Rebecca.

1134
01:29:31,117 --> 01:29:32,910
It was all a lie.

1135
01:29:34,537 --> 01:29:37,123
I knew where Rebecca's body was.

1136
01:29:38,291 --> 01:29:41,252
Lying on that cabin floor
on the bottom of the sea.

1137
01:29:41,335 --> 01:29:43,588
How did you know, Maxim?

1138
01:29:44,672 --> 01:29:48,134
Because I put it there.

1139
01:29:55,933 --> 01:29:59,520
Will you look into my eyes
and tell me that you love me now?

1140
01:30:11,991 --> 01:30:15,328
You see? I was right.

1141
01:30:17,413 --> 01:30:18,623
It's too late.

1142
01:30:25,338 --> 01:30:28,466
No, it's not too late.
You're not to say that.

1143
01:30:28,549 --> 01:30:31,094
I love you more
than anything in the world.

1144
01:30:31,177 --> 01:30:33,513
Oh, please, Maxim, kiss me, please.

1145
01:30:33,596 --> 01:30:37,225
No. It's no use. It's too late.

1146
01:30:37,308 --> 01:30:39,727
We can't lose each other now.

1147
01:30:39,811 --> 01:30:42,855
We must be together always,
with no secrets, no shadows.

1148
01:30:42,939 --> 01:30:45,942
We may only have
a few days, a few hours.

1149
01:30:46,025 --> 01:30:48,277
Maxim, why didn't you tell me before?

1150
01:30:48,361 --> 01:30:51,239
I nearly did sometimes,
but you never seemed close enough.

1151
01:30:51,322 --> 01:30:54,992
How could we be close when I knew
you were always thinking of Rebecca?

1152
01:30:55,076 --> 01:30:58,871
How could I even ask you to love me
when I knew you loved Rebecca still?

1153
01:31:00,414 --> 01:31:04,877
What are you talking about?
What do you mean?

1154
01:31:06,629 --> 01:31:10,967
Whenever you touched me, I knew
you were comparing me with Rebecca.

1155
01:31:11,050 --> 01:31:15,680
Whenever you looked at me or spoke to me
or walked with me in the garden,

1156
01:31:15,763 --> 01:31:17,807
I knew you were thinking,

1157
01:31:17,890 --> 01:31:21,144
"This I did with Rebecca, and this and this."

1158
01:31:21,227 --> 01:31:23,146
Oh, it's true, isn't it?

1159
01:31:23,229 --> 01:31:26,858
You thought I loved Rebecca?
You thought that?

1160
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:31,112
I hated her.

1161
01:31:43,666 --> 01:31:46,043
Oh, I was carried away by her,

1162
01:31:46,127 --> 01:31:48,754
enchanted by her, as everyone was.

1163
01:31:48,838 --> 01:31:53,426
And when I was married, I was told
I was the luckiest man in the world.

1164
01:31:56,387 --> 01:31:58,848
She was so lovely,

1165
01:31:58,931 --> 01:32:02,059
so accomplished, so amusing.

1166
01:32:03,311 --> 01:32:06,981
"She's got the three things that really
matter in a wife," everyone said.

1167
01:32:07,064 --> 01:32:08,983
"Breeding, brains and beauty."

1168
01:32:09,066 --> 01:32:12,236
And I believed them, completely.

1169
01:32:13,779 --> 01:32:16,824
But I never had
a moment's happiness with her.

1170
01:32:16,908 --> 01:32:19,619
She was incapable of love

1171
01:32:19,702 --> 01:32:23,414
or tenderness or decency.

1172
01:32:24,498 --> 01:32:27,960
You didn't love her?
You didn't love her?

1173
01:32:28,044 --> 01:32:32,215
Do you remember that cliff
where you first saw me in Monte Carlo?

1174
01:32:33,633 --> 01:32:36,344
Well, I went there with Rebecca
on our honeymoon.

1175
01:32:36,427 --> 01:32:38,554
That was where I found out about her.

1176
01:32:38,638 --> 01:32:41,515
Four days after we were married.

1177
01:32:41,599 --> 01:32:44,602
She stood there laughing,

1178
01:32:44,685 --> 01:32:46,938
her black hair blowing in the wind,

1179
01:32:47,813 --> 01:32:50,524
and told me all about herself.

1180
01:32:50,608 --> 01:32:52,068
Everything.

1181
01:32:53,861 --> 01:32:56,239
Things I'll never tell a living soul.

1182
01:32:57,823 --> 01:32:59,825
I wanted to kill her.

1183
01:32:59,909 --> 01:33:02,370
It would have been so easy.
Remember the precipice?

1184
01:33:04,455 --> 01:33:09,168
I frightened you, didn't I?
You thought I was mad.

1185
01:33:09,252 --> 01:33:12,505
Perhaps I was.
Perhaps I am mad.

1186
01:33:13,506 --> 01:33:16,759
It wouldn't make for sanity, would it,
living with the devil?

1187
01:33:20,012 --> 01:33:22,640
"I'll make a bargain with you," she said.

1188
01:33:22,723 --> 01:33:26,310
"You'd look rather foolish trying to
divorce me now, after four days of marriage,

1189
01:33:26,394 --> 01:33:30,064
so I'll play the part of a devoted wife,
mistress of your precious Manderley.

1190
01:33:30,147 --> 01:33:33,109
I'll make it the most famous showplace
in England, if you like,

1191
01:33:33,192 --> 01:33:35,403
and people will visit us and envy us

1192
01:33:35,486 --> 01:33:38,447
and say we're the luckiest,
happiest couple in the country.

1193
01:33:40,199 --> 01:33:43,786
What a grand joke it will be!
What a triumph!"

1194
01:33:48,374 --> 01:33:52,461
I should never have accepted
her dirty bargain, but I did.

1195
01:33:53,879 --> 01:33:57,591
I was younger then and tremendously
conscious of the family honor.

1196
01:33:58,467 --> 01:34:01,262
Family honor.

1197
01:34:02,805 --> 01:34:05,599
She knew that I'd sacrifice everything
rather than stand up in a divorce court

1198
01:34:05,683 --> 01:34:09,020
and give her away, admit that
our marriage was a rotten fraud.

1199
01:34:11,522 --> 01:34:15,234
You despise me, don't you?
As I despise myself.

1200
01:34:15,318 --> 01:34:20,573
You can't understand what
my feelings were, can you?

1201
01:34:22,074 --> 01:34:24,744
Of course I can, darling.
Of course I can.

1202
01:34:27,413 --> 01:34:31,000
Well, I kept the bargain.
And so did she, apparently.

1203
01:34:31,083 --> 01:34:33,586
Oh, she played the game brilliantly.

1204
01:34:33,669 --> 01:34:36,422
But after a while,
she began to grow careless.

1205
01:34:36,505 --> 01:34:40,009
She took a flat in London,
and she'd stay away for days at a time.

1206
01:34:40,092 --> 01:34:42,762
Then she started to bring
her friends down here.

1207
01:34:42,845 --> 01:34:44,638
I warned her,
but she shrugged her shoulders.

1208
01:34:44,722 --> 01:34:47,016
"What's it got to do with you?"
she said.

1209
01:34:47,099 --> 01:34:52,480
She even started on Frank.
Poor, faithful Frank.

1210
01:34:52,563 --> 01:34:56,275
Then there was a cousin of hers,
a man named Favell.

1211
01:34:56,359 --> 01:34:59,779
Yes, I know him.
He came the day you went to London.

1212
01:35:00,988 --> 01:35:02,406
Why didn't you tell me?

1213
01:35:02,490 --> 01:35:07,745
I didn't like to. I thought
it would remind you of Rebecca.

1214
01:35:07,828 --> 01:35:11,374
Remind me?

1215
01:35:11,457 --> 01:35:13,084
As if I needed reminding.

1216
01:35:14,668 --> 01:35:18,047
Favell used to visit her
here in this cottage.

1217
01:35:18,130 --> 01:35:22,134
I found out about it, and I warned her that
if he came here again, I'd shoot them both.

1218
01:35:23,803 --> 01:35:27,681
One night when I found that
she'd come back quietly from London,

1219
01:35:27,765 --> 01:35:29,725
I thought that Favell was with her,

1220
01:35:29,809 --> 01:35:34,855
and I knew then I couldn't stand this
life of filth and deceit any longer.

1221
01:35:36,023 --> 01:35:40,486
I decided to come down here
and have it out with both of them.

1222
01:35:42,488 --> 01:35:44,448
But she was alone.

1223
01:35:44,532 --> 01:35:47,284
She was expecting Favell,
but he hadn't come.

1224
01:35:47,368 --> 01:35:49,537
She was lying on the divan,

1225
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:53,082
a large tray of cigarette stubs beside her.

1226
01:35:53,165 --> 01:35:56,252
She looked ill, queer.

1227
01:35:56,335 --> 01:35:58,671
Suddenly she got up,

1228
01:35:58,754 --> 01:36:01,465
started to walk toward me.

1229
01:36:01,549 --> 01:36:03,759
"When I have a child," she said,

1230
01:36:03,843 --> 01:36:06,929
"neither you nor anyone else
could ever prove it wasn't yours.

1231
01:36:07,012 --> 01:36:11,434
You'd like to have an heir, wouldn't you,
Max, for your precious Manderley?"

1232
01:36:11,517 --> 01:36:13,436
Then she started to laugh.

1233
01:36:13,519 --> 01:36:16,939
"How funny.
How supremely, wonderfully funny.

1234
01:36:17,022 --> 01:36:20,192
"I'd be the perfect mother,
just as I've been the perfect wife.

1235
01:36:20,276 --> 01:36:22,319
"No one will ever know.

1236
01:36:22,403 --> 01:36:24,822
"It ought to give you
the thrill of your life, Max,

1237
01:36:24,905 --> 01:36:27,616
"to watch my son grow bigger
day by day

1238
01:36:27,700 --> 01:36:31,996
and to know that when you die,
Manderley will be his."

1239
01:36:32,079 --> 01:36:34,748
She was face to face with me,

1240
01:36:34,832 --> 01:36:37,334
one hand in her pocket,

1241
01:36:37,418 --> 01:36:40,087
the other holding a cigarette.

1242
01:36:40,171 --> 01:36:42,590
She was smiling.

1243
01:36:42,673 --> 01:36:46,427
"Well, Max,
what are you going to do about it?

1244
01:36:47,970 --> 01:36:50,306
Aren't you going to kill me?"

1245
01:36:52,558 --> 01:36:54,977
I suppose I went mad for a moment.

1246
01:36:56,437 --> 01:36:58,981
I must have struck her.

1247
01:37:02,526 --> 01:37:04,445
She stood staring at me.

1248
01:37:05,821 --> 01:37:08,407
She looked almost triumphant.

1249
01:37:09,825 --> 01:37:14,163
Then she started
toward me again, smiling.

1250
01:37:14,246 --> 01:37:16,874
Suddenly she stumbled and fell.

1251
01:37:22,379 --> 01:37:27,009
When I looked down ‒ ages afterwards,
it seemed ‒ she was lying on the floor.

1252
01:37:27,092 --> 01:37:31,764
She'd struck her head
on a heavy piece of ship's tackle.

1253
01:37:33,933 --> 01:37:37,853
I remember wondering
why she was still smiling.

1254
01:37:37,937 --> 01:37:39,980
Then I realized she was dead.

1255
01:37:40,064 --> 01:37:43,150
But you didn't kill her.
It was an accident.

1256
01:37:43,901 --> 01:37:47,905
Who would believe me?
I lost my head.

1257
01:37:47,988 --> 01:37:51,367
I just knew I had to do something, anything.

1258
01:37:52,368 --> 01:37:54,703
I carried her out to the boat.

1259
01:37:55,704 --> 01:37:59,041
It was very dark.
There was no moon.

1260
01:37:59,124 --> 01:38:01,210
I put her in the cabin.

1261
01:38:01,293 --> 01:38:03,629
When the boat seemed a safe distance
from the shore, I took a spike

1262
01:38:03,712 --> 01:38:07,007
and drove it again and again
through the planking of the hull.

1263
01:38:07,091 --> 01:38:10,386
I had opened up the seacocks,
and the water began to come in fast.

1264
01:38:10,469 --> 01:38:13,556
I climbed over into the dinghy
and pulled away.

1265
01:38:13,639 --> 01:38:18,811
I saw the boat heel over and sink.

1266
01:38:20,729 --> 01:38:22,731
I pulled back into the cove.

1267
01:38:23,816 --> 01:38:26,735
It started raining.

1268
01:38:26,819 --> 01:38:29,530
Maxim, does anyone else know this?

1269
01:38:29,613 --> 01:38:32,283
No, no one, except you and me.

1270
01:38:33,659 --> 01:38:35,619
We must explain it.

1271
01:38:35,703 --> 01:38:38,872
It's got to be the body
of someone you've never seen before.

1272
01:38:38,956 --> 01:38:40,958
No, they're bound to know her.

1273
01:38:41,041 --> 01:38:44,044
Her rings, bracelets she always wore.

1274
01:38:44,128 --> 01:38:46,255
They'll identify her body.

1275
01:38:46,338 --> 01:38:49,258
Then they'll remember the other woman,

1276
01:38:49,341 --> 01:38:52,595
the other woman buried in the crypt.

1277
01:38:52,678 --> 01:38:54,513
If they find out it was Rebecca,

1278
01:38:54,597 --> 01:38:57,808
you must simply say that you made
a mistake about the other body ‒

1279
01:38:57,891 --> 01:39:00,811
that the day you went to Edgecombe
you were ill, you didn't know what you were doing.

1280
01:39:00,894 --> 01:39:03,105
Rebecca's dead.
That's what we've got to remember.

1281
01:39:03,188 --> 01:39:05,441
Rebecca's dead. She can't speak.
She can't bear witness.

1282
01:39:05,524 --> 01:39:07,526
She can't harm you anymore.

1283
01:39:07,610 --> 01:39:10,613
We're the only two people in the world
that know, Maxim ‒ you and I.

1284
01:39:10,696 --> 01:39:14,158
I told you once that I'd done
a very selfish thing in marrying you.

1285
01:39:14,241 --> 01:39:17,661
You can understand now what I meant.

1286
01:39:17,745 --> 01:39:20,164
I've loved you, my darling.

1287
01:39:20,247 --> 01:39:21,957
I shall always love you.

1288
01:39:23,083 --> 01:39:27,504
But I've known all along
that Rebecca would win in the end.

1289
01:39:27,588 --> 01:39:29,757
No, no, she hasn't won.

1290
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:32,593
No matter what happens now,
she hasn't won.

1291
01:39:47,066 --> 01:39:49,485
Hello? Hel ‒

1292
01:39:50,778 --> 01:39:54,323
Hello, Frank. Hello, Frank. Yes.

1293
01:39:54,406 --> 01:39:56,033
Who? Colonel Julyan?

1294
01:39:57,618 --> 01:40:01,163
Yes, tell him I'll meet him there
as soon as I possibly can.

1295
01:40:01,246 --> 01:40:04,833
What? Oh.

1296
01:40:04,917 --> 01:40:09,672
Well, say we could talk about that
when we're sure about the matter.

1297
01:40:10,839 --> 01:40:12,007
Yes.

1298
01:40:13,592 --> 01:40:15,135
What's happened?

1299
01:40:16,553 --> 01:40:21,183
Colonel Julyan called.
He's the chief constable of the county.

1300
01:40:21,266 --> 01:40:24,520
He's been asked by the police
to go to the mortuary.

1301
01:40:24,603 --> 01:40:28,774
He wants to know if I could
possibly have made a mistake

1302
01:40:28,857 --> 01:40:30,776
about that other body.

1303
01:40:50,713 --> 01:40:55,134
Well, Colonel Julyan, apparently I did
make a mistake about that other body.

1304
01:40:55,217 --> 01:40:57,636
The mistake was quite natural
under the circumstances.

1305
01:40:57,720 --> 01:41:01,181
- Besides, you weren't well at the time.
- That's nonsense. I was perfectly well.

1306
01:41:01,265 --> 01:41:03,350
Well, don't let it worry you, Maxim.

1307
01:41:03,434 --> 01:41:06,103
Nobody can blame you
for making a mistake.

1308
01:41:06,186 --> 01:41:09,940
The pity is, you've got to go through
the same thing all over again.

1309
01:41:10,023 --> 01:41:13,068
- What do you mean?
- There'll have to be another inquest, of course.

1310
01:41:13,152 --> 01:41:15,612
- Same formality and red tape.
- Oh.

1311
01:41:15,696 --> 01:41:19,241
I wish you could be spared the publicity of it,
but I'm afraid that's impossible.

1312
01:41:19,324 --> 01:41:21,744
Oh, yes, the publicity.

1313
01:41:21,827 --> 01:41:24,538
I suppose Mrs. de Winter
went below for something

1314
01:41:24,621 --> 01:41:27,916
and a squall hit the boat
with nobody at the helm.

1315
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:31,211
I imagine that's about the solution of it,
don't you think so, Crawley?

1316
01:41:31,295 --> 01:41:34,465
Oh, yes. Probably the door jammed
and she couldn't get on deck again.

1317
01:41:34,548 --> 01:41:36,467
Yes. Tabb, the boatbuilder,

1318
01:41:36,550 --> 01:41:39,011
will undoubtedly come
to some such conclusion.

1319
01:41:39,094 --> 01:41:41,555
Why? What would he know about it?

1320
01:41:41,638 --> 01:41:43,682
Well, he's examining the boat now.

1321
01:41:43,766 --> 01:41:46,018
Purely as a matter of routine, you know.

1322
01:41:46,101 --> 01:41:49,688
I'll be at the inquest tomorrow, Maxim ‒
quite unofficially, you know.

1323
01:41:49,772 --> 01:41:52,441
We must get together for a game of golf
when it's all over, eh?

1324
01:41:52,524 --> 01:41:54,151
- Yes.
- Bye-bye.

1325
01:42:07,247 --> 01:42:09,500
I have the evening papers, madam.

1326
01:42:09,583 --> 01:42:11,835
- Would you care to see them?
- Oh, no, thank you, Frith.

1327
01:42:11,919 --> 01:42:14,630
And I'd prefer that Mr. de Winter
weren't troubled with them either.

1328
01:42:14,713 --> 01:42:18,008
I understand, madam. Permit me to say
that we're all most distressed outside.

1329
01:42:18,091 --> 01:42:19,301
Oh, thank you, Frith.

1330
01:42:19,384 --> 01:42:22,095
I'm afraid the news has been
a great shock to Mrs. Danvers.

1331
01:42:22,179 --> 01:42:24,473
Yes, I rather expected it would be.

1332
01:42:24,556 --> 01:42:27,309
It seems there's to be
a coroner's inquest, madam?

1333
01:42:27,392 --> 01:42:29,978
Yes, Frith. It's purely a formality.

1334
01:42:30,062 --> 01:42:31,730
Of course, madam. I...

1335
01:42:31,814 --> 01:42:35,484
I wanted to say that if any of us
might be required to give evidence,

1336
01:42:35,567 --> 01:42:38,779
I should be only too pleased to do
anything that might help the family.

1337
01:42:38,862 --> 01:42:42,741
Oh, thank you, Frith. I'm sure Mr. de Winter
will be very happy to hear it.

1338
01:42:42,825 --> 01:42:45,911
But I don't think
anything will be necessary.

1339
01:42:59,174 --> 01:43:00,759
Maxim.

1340
01:43:02,135 --> 01:43:03,595
Hello, darling.

1341
01:43:04,805 --> 01:43:08,851
Oh, Maxim, I'm... I'm worried about
what you'll do at the inquest tomorrow.

1342
01:43:08,934 --> 01:43:11,061
What do you mean?

1343
01:43:11,144 --> 01:43:12,855
You won't lose your temper, will you?

1344
01:43:12,938 --> 01:43:15,691
Promise me that they
won't make you angry.

1345
01:43:15,774 --> 01:43:18,694
All right, darling, I promise.

1346
01:43:18,777 --> 01:43:22,155
No matter what he asks you,
you won't lose your head.

1347
01:43:22,239 --> 01:43:24,324
Don't worry, dear.

1348
01:43:24,408 --> 01:43:27,202
They can't do anything at once, can they?

1349
01:43:27,286 --> 01:43:29,204
No.

1350
01:43:29,288 --> 01:43:32,374
- Then we've a little time left to be together?
- Yes.

1351
01:43:33,917 --> 01:43:36,295
I want to go to the inquest with you.

1352
01:43:36,378 --> 01:43:38,005
I'd rather you didn't, darling.

1353
01:43:38,088 --> 01:43:40,591
But I can't wait here alone.

1354
01:43:40,674 --> 01:43:43,135
I promise you I won't be
any trouble to you.

1355
01:43:43,218 --> 01:43:46,763
And I must be near you
so that no matter what happens,

1356
01:43:46,847 --> 01:43:49,725
we won't be separated for a moment.

1357
01:43:50,767 --> 01:43:52,311
All right, dear.

1358
01:43:54,354 --> 01:43:58,025
I don't mind this whole thing,
except for you.

1359
01:43:58,108 --> 01:44:00,903
I can't forget what it's done to you.

1360
01:44:00,986 --> 01:44:03,989
I've been thinking of nothing else
since it happened.

1361
01:44:05,115 --> 01:44:06,366
No, no.

1362
01:44:07,784 --> 01:44:10,537
It's gone forever.

1363
01:44:10,621 --> 01:44:14,541
That funny, young, lost look I loved...

1364
01:44:15,667 --> 01:44:17,586
won't ever come back.

1365
01:44:18,712 --> 01:44:22,299
I killed that when I told you
about Rebecca.

1366
01:44:22,382 --> 01:44:24,843
It's gone.

1367
01:44:24,927 --> 01:44:26,470
In a few hours...

1368
01:44:27,721 --> 01:44:29,973
you've grown so much older.

1369
01:44:31,475 --> 01:44:34,061
Oh, Maxim, Maxim.

1370
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:02,005
Black Jack Brady was his name.

1371
01:45:02,089 --> 01:45:04,925
The most important arrest I ever made.

1372
01:45:05,008 --> 01:45:06,969
It must have been
about two years ago now.

1373
01:45:07,052 --> 01:45:11,139
Of course there was no doubt about it.
He was hung a month after I caught him.

1374
01:45:11,223 --> 01:45:13,600
Hello, wait a minute.

1375
01:45:13,684 --> 01:45:15,727
They've got old Barmy Ben up now.

1376
01:45:16,645 --> 01:45:19,189
You remember
the late Mrs. de Winter, don't you?

1377
01:45:19,272 --> 01:45:21,400
- She's gone.
- Yes, we know that.

1378
01:45:21,483 --> 01:45:24,152
She went in the sea.
The sea got her.

1379
01:45:24,236 --> 01:45:27,072
That's right, that's right.
Now, we want you to tell us

1380
01:45:27,155 --> 01:45:30,075
whether you were on the shore
that last night she went sailing.

1381
01:45:30,158 --> 01:45:32,411
- Eh?
- Were you on the shore

1382
01:45:32,494 --> 01:45:35,831
that last night she went out,
when she didn't come back?

1383
01:45:35,914 --> 01:45:37,666
I didn't see nothin'.

1384
01:45:37,749 --> 01:45:42,462
I don't want to go to the asylum.
Them cruel folks there.

1385
01:45:42,546 --> 01:45:44,673
Now, nobody's going
to send you to the asylum.

1386
01:45:44,756 --> 01:45:47,592
All we want you to do
is to tell us what you saw.

1387
01:45:47,676 --> 01:45:49,386
I didn't see nothin'.

1388
01:45:49,469 --> 01:45:54,766
Come, come. Did you see Mrs. de Winter
get into her boat that last night?

1389
01:45:54,850 --> 01:45:56,351
I don't know nothin'.

1390
01:45:57,185 --> 01:45:59,438
I don't want to go to the asylum.

1391
01:46:02,065 --> 01:46:03,900
Very well. You may go.

1392
01:46:03,984 --> 01:46:05,986
- Eh?
- You may go now.

1393
01:46:07,863 --> 01:46:10,907
Mr. Tabb,
would you step forward, please?

1394
01:46:14,953 --> 01:46:19,041
The evidence you give will be the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth?

1395
01:46:19,124 --> 01:46:22,127
I do, so help me God.

1396
01:46:22,210 --> 01:46:25,881
The late Mrs. de Winter used to send her boat
to your shipyard for reconditioning.

1397
01:46:25,964 --> 01:46:28,842
- That's right, sir.
- Can you remember any occasion

1398
01:46:28,925 --> 01:46:31,678
- when she had any sort of accident with the boat?
- No, sir.

1399
01:46:31,762 --> 01:46:33,680
I often said Mrs. de Winter
was a born sailor.

1400
01:46:33,764 --> 01:46:36,391
Now, when Mrs. de Winter
went below, as is supposed,

1401
01:46:36,475 --> 01:46:38,393
and a sudden gust of wind came down,

1402
01:46:38,477 --> 01:46:40,520
that would be enough
to capsize the boat, wouldn't it?

1403
01:46:40,604 --> 01:46:44,649
Excuse me, sir, but there's
a little more to it than that.

1404
01:46:44,733 --> 01:46:48,236
- What do you mean, Mr. Tabb?
- I mean, sir, the sea cocks.

1405
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:50,489
- What are the sea cocks?
- Sea cock ‒

1406
01:46:50,572 --> 01:46:55,243
Oh, well, the sea cocks
are the valves to drain out the boat,

1407
01:46:55,327 --> 01:46:59,748
and they're always kept tight closed
when you're afloat.

1408
01:46:59,831 --> 01:47:01,416
Yes?

1409
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:05,045
Well, yesterday when I examined that boat,
I found they'd been opened.

1410
01:47:05,128 --> 01:47:08,381
- What could be the reason for that?
- Just this.

1411
01:47:08,465 --> 01:47:10,634
That's what flooded the boat
and sunk her.

1412
01:47:12,344 --> 01:47:15,847
- Are you implying ‒
- That boat never capsized at all.

1413
01:47:15,931 --> 01:47:20,519
I know it's a terrible thing to say, sir,
but in my opinion, she was scuttled.

1414
01:47:24,314 --> 01:47:27,359
- And there's them holes.
- What holes?

1415
01:47:27,442 --> 01:47:30,654
- In her planking.
- What are you talking about?

1416
01:47:30,737 --> 01:47:34,241
Of course, that boat's been
underwater for over a year,

1417
01:47:34,324 --> 01:47:36,535
and the tide's been knocking her
against the ridge,

1418
01:47:36,618 --> 01:47:41,706
but it seemed to me them holes looked
as if she'd made 'em from the inside.

1419
01:47:43,542 --> 01:47:45,418
Then you believe she must have
done it deliberately.

1420
01:47:45,502 --> 01:47:48,797
Couldn't have been no accident,
not with her knowledge of boats.

1421
01:47:52,467 --> 01:47:54,553
You knew the former Mrs. de Winter
very well, I believe.

1422
01:47:54,636 --> 01:47:55,804
Oh, yes.

1423
01:47:55,887 --> 01:47:58,223
Would you have believed her
capable of suicide?

1424
01:47:58,306 --> 01:48:02,060
No, frankly, I would not,
but you never can tell.

1425
01:48:02,144 --> 01:48:04,688
You may stand down, Mr. Tabb.

1426
01:48:05,939 --> 01:48:07,357
Mr. de Winter, please.

1427
01:48:16,700 --> 01:48:19,744
I'm sorry to drag you back
for further questioning, Mr. de Winter.

1428
01:48:19,828 --> 01:48:21,371
You've heard the statement of Mr. Tabb.

1429
01:48:21,454 --> 01:48:23,623
- I wonder if you can help us in any way.
- I'm afraid not.

1430
01:48:23,707 --> 01:48:25,750
Can you think of any reason
why there should be holes

1431
01:48:25,834 --> 01:48:28,503
in the planking of the late
Mrs. de Winter's boat?

1432
01:48:28,587 --> 01:48:30,714
Well, of course I can't
think of any reason.

1433
01:48:30,797 --> 01:48:33,466
Has anyone ever discussed
these holes with you before?

1434
01:48:33,550 --> 01:48:37,470
Well, since the boat has been at the bottom
of the ocean, I scarcely think that likely.

1435
01:48:37,554 --> 01:48:40,974
Mr. de Winter, I want you to believe
we all feel very deeply for you,

1436
01:48:41,057 --> 01:48:43,518
but I don't conduct this inquiry
for my own amusement.

1437
01:48:43,602 --> 01:48:46,271
- That's rather obvious, isn't it?
- I hope that it is.

1438
01:48:46,354 --> 01:48:49,900
Since Mrs. de Winter went sailing alone,
are we to believe she drove those holes herself?

1439
01:48:49,983 --> 01:48:51,776
You may believe what you like.

1440
01:48:51,860 --> 01:48:55,822
Can you enlighten us as to why Mrs. de Winter
should have wanted to end her own life?

1441
01:48:55,906 --> 01:48:57,824
I know of no reason whatever.

1442
01:48:57,908 --> 01:49:00,160
Mr. de Winter,
however painful it may be,

1443
01:49:00,243 --> 01:49:02,454
I have to ask you
a very personal question.

1444
01:49:02,537 --> 01:49:06,499
Were relations between you
and the late Mrs. de Winter perfectly happy?

1445
01:49:08,335 --> 01:49:12,047
Were relations between you
and the late Mrs. de Winter perfectly happy?

1446
01:49:12,130 --> 01:49:14,674
I won't stand this any longer!
And you might as well know now ‒

1447
01:49:14,758 --> 01:49:16,885
It's my wife. She's fainted.

1448
01:49:16,968 --> 01:49:18,428
We'll adjourn till after lunch.

1449
01:49:18,511 --> 01:49:20,972
Mr. de Winter, I presume
you'll be available for us then?

1450
01:49:23,308 --> 01:49:25,477
I told you you should
have had some breakfast.

1451
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:28,104
You're hungry.
That's what's the matter with you.

1452
01:49:33,151 --> 01:49:36,196
Mr. Frith thought you might like to
have some lunch and sent me with it.

1453
01:49:36,279 --> 01:49:39,074
- That's fine. Can you pull around the corner?
- Very good, sir.

1454
01:49:49,251 --> 01:49:51,336
Awfully foolish of me fainting like that.

1455
01:49:51,419 --> 01:49:54,047
Nonsense. If you hadn't fainted,
I'd have really lost my temper.

1456
01:49:54,130 --> 01:49:55,340
Darling, please be careful.

1457
01:50:02,597 --> 01:50:04,683
Darling, wait here a few moments.

1458
01:50:04,766 --> 01:50:07,018
- I'll see if I can find old Frank.
- Of course, darling.

1459
01:50:07,102 --> 01:50:09,646
- Don't worry about me. I'll be all right.
- Sure?

1460
01:50:09,729 --> 01:50:11,398
All right.

1461
01:50:11,481 --> 01:50:14,901
Here, have a spot of this.
Do you good.

1462
01:50:14,985 --> 01:50:16,528
Thank you.

1463
01:50:18,905 --> 01:50:21,491
- Sure you're all right?
- Yes, of course.

1464
01:50:22,450 --> 01:50:24,202
- Won't be long.
- Right you are.

1465
01:50:27,706 --> 01:50:29,541
- Ugh.
- Hello.

1466
01:50:29,624 --> 01:50:32,669
And how does the bride
find herself today?

1467
01:50:35,547 --> 01:50:38,758
I say, marriage with Max is not exactly
a bed of roses, is it?

1468
01:50:38,842 --> 01:50:41,177
I think you'd better go
before Maxim gets back.

1469
01:50:41,261 --> 01:50:44,639
Oh, jealous, is he?
Well, I can't say I blame him.

1470
01:50:44,723 --> 01:50:47,267
But you don't think
I'm the Big Bad Wolf, do you?

1471
01:50:47,350 --> 01:50:50,186
I'm not, you know.
I'm a perfectly ordinary, harmless bloke.

1472
01:50:50,270 --> 01:50:53,106
And I think you're behaving
splendidly over all this.

1473
01:50:53,189 --> 01:50:55,108
Perfectly splendidly.

1474
01:50:55,191 --> 01:50:58,028
You know, you've grown up a bit
since I last saw you.

1475
01:50:58,111 --> 01:51:00,363
- It's no wonder.
- What do you want, Favell?

1476
01:51:00,447 --> 01:51:04,326
Oh, hello, Max. Things are going
pretty well for you, aren't they?

1477
01:51:04,409 --> 01:51:06,328
Better than you ever expected.

1478
01:51:06,411 --> 01:51:09,164
I was rather worried about you at first.
That's why I came down to the inquest.

1479
01:51:09,247 --> 01:51:12,751
I'm touched by your solicitude,
but if you don't mind we'd like to have our lunch.

1480
01:51:13,626 --> 01:51:17,714
Lunch! I say, what a jolly idea!
Rather like a picnic, isn't it?

1481
01:51:18,673 --> 01:51:21,634
I'm so sorry.
Do you mind if I put this there?

1482
01:51:21,718 --> 01:51:25,263
You know, Max, old boy, I really think
I ought to talk things over with you.

1483
01:51:25,347 --> 01:51:26,639
Talk what things over?

1484
01:51:28,058 --> 01:51:31,144
Well, those holes in the planking,
for one thing.

1485
01:51:31,227 --> 01:51:33,855
Those holes that were drilled
from the inside.

1486
01:51:33,938 --> 01:51:36,274
- Oh, Mullen!
- Yes, sir?

1487
01:51:36,358 --> 01:51:39,569
Would you, like a good fellow, have my car
filled with petrol? It's almost empty.

1488
01:51:39,652 --> 01:51:40,653
Very good, sir.

1489
01:51:40,737 --> 01:51:42,989
- And Mullen, close the door, will you?
- Yes, sir.

1490
01:51:44,407 --> 01:51:46,076
Does this bother you?

1491
01:51:53,416 --> 01:51:55,502
You know, old boy,
I have a strong feeling

1492
01:51:55,585 --> 01:51:58,588
that before the day is out
somebody's going to make use of that, uh,

1493
01:51:58,671 --> 01:52:03,343
rather expressive, though somewhat
old-fashioned term "foul play."

1494
01:52:05,095 --> 01:52:06,846
Am I boring you with all this?

1495
01:52:08,181 --> 01:52:10,892
No? Good.

1496
01:52:10,975 --> 01:52:14,521
Well, you see, Max, I find myself
in a rather awkward position.

1497
01:52:14,604 --> 01:52:18,817
You've only got to read this note
to understand. It's from Rebecca.

1498
01:52:18,900 --> 01:52:21,986
And what's more, she had the foresight
to put the date on it.

1499
01:52:23,279 --> 01:52:25,073
She wrote it to me
the day she died.

1500
01:52:25,156 --> 01:52:27,242
Incidentally,
I was out on a party on that night,

1501
01:52:27,325 --> 01:52:28,868
so I didn't get it until the next day.

1502
01:52:28,952 --> 01:52:31,413
What makes you think
that note would interest me?

1503
01:52:31,496 --> 01:52:33,581
Oh, I'm not going to bother you
with the contents now,

1504
01:52:33,665 --> 01:52:35,917
but I can assure you that
it is not the note of a woman

1505
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,503
who intends to drown herself
that same night.

1506
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:44,926
By the way,
what do you do with old bones?

1507
01:52:45,009 --> 01:52:47,387
Bury them, eh, what?

1508
01:52:47,470 --> 01:52:50,640
However, for the time being ‒

1509
01:52:51,933 --> 01:52:54,936
You know, Max, I'm getting awfully fed up
with my job as a motorcar salesman.

1510
01:52:55,019 --> 01:52:56,646
I don't know if you've ever
experienced the feeling

1511
01:52:56,729 --> 01:52:59,149
of driving an expensive motorcar
which isn't your own,

1512
01:52:59,232 --> 01:53:02,068
but it can be very, very exasperating.

1513
01:53:02,152 --> 01:53:05,196
You know what I mean.
You want to own the car yourself.

1514
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:08,324
I've often wondered what it would be like
to retire to the country,

1515
01:53:08,408 --> 01:53:11,536
have a nice little place
with a few acres of shooting.

1516
01:53:11,619 --> 01:53:15,748
I've never figured out what it would cost a year,
but I'd like to talk about it with you.

1517
01:53:15,832 --> 01:53:18,877
I'd like to have your advice on how
to live comfortably without hard work.

1518
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:23,756
Hello, Favell.
You looking for me, Maxim?

1519
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:26,134
Yes.

1520
01:53:26,217 --> 01:53:29,012
Mr. Favell and I have a little
business transaction on hand.

1521
01:53:29,095 --> 01:53:31,890
I think we had better
conduct it over at the inn.

1522
01:53:32,765 --> 01:53:34,767
They may have a private room there.

1523
01:53:36,311 --> 01:53:37,937
Well, see you later.

1524
01:53:38,938 --> 01:53:41,900
Find Colonel Julyan.
Tell him I want to see him immediately.

1525
01:53:41,983 --> 01:53:44,402
Come on, Favell. Let's go.

1526
01:53:49,157 --> 01:53:51,159
Have you a private room, please?

1527
01:53:51,242 --> 01:53:54,078
- Of course, sir. Through there, sir.
- Thank you.

1528
01:53:57,081 --> 01:53:59,167
Hope this will do, Mr. de Winter.

1529
01:53:59,250 --> 01:54:01,753
Oh, it's splendid, splendid.
Exactly like the Ritz.

1530
01:54:01,878 --> 01:54:05,423
- Any orders, gents?
- Yes, you might bring me a large brandy and soda.

1531
01:54:05,507 --> 01:54:09,260
How about you, Max? Have one on me.
I feel I can afford to play host.

1532
01:54:09,344 --> 01:54:12,055
- Thanks. I don't mind if I do.
- Make it two, will you, my good fellow?

1533
01:54:12,138 --> 01:54:13,848
- Very good, sir.
- Where's Mr. de Winter?

1534
01:54:13,932 --> 01:54:16,476
Oh, through the other door, sir.

1535
01:54:16,559 --> 01:54:18,228
Colonel Julyan, this is Mr. Favell.

1536
01:54:20,063 --> 01:54:22,273
Oh, I know Colonel Julyan.
We're old friends, aren't we?

1537
01:54:22,357 --> 01:54:25,401
Since you're old friends, I assume you
also know he's head of the police here.

1538
01:54:25,485 --> 01:54:28,863
I think he might be interested to hear
your proposition. Go on, tell him all about it.

1539
01:54:28,947 --> 01:54:32,575
I merely said I hoped to give up
selling cars and retire into the country.

1540
01:54:32,659 --> 01:54:36,746
Actually, he offered to withhold a vital piece
of evidence if I made it worth his while.

1541
01:54:36,829 --> 01:54:39,457
I only want to see justice done, Colonel.

1542
01:54:39,541 --> 01:54:42,210
Now, that boatbuilder's evidence
suggested certain possible theories

1543
01:54:42,293 --> 01:54:43,711
concerning Rebecca's death.

1544
01:54:43,795 --> 01:54:45,380
One of them, of course, is suicide.

1545
01:54:45,463 --> 01:54:49,676
I have a little note here which I consider
puts that possibility quite out of court.

1546
01:54:49,759 --> 01:54:52,303
Read it, Colonel.

1547
01:54:52,387 --> 01:54:54,514
"Jack, darling,
I've just seen the doctor

1548
01:54:54,597 --> 01:54:56,599
and I'm going down to Manderley
right away.

1549
01:54:56,683 --> 01:55:00,353
I shall be at the cottage all this evening
and shall leave the door open for you.

1550
01:55:00,436 --> 01:55:04,399
I have something terribly
important to tell you. Rebecca."

1551
01:55:04,482 --> 01:55:08,152
Now, does that look like the note of a woman
who had made up her mind to kill herself?

1552
01:55:08,236 --> 01:55:10,989
And apart from that, Colonel, do you mean to
tell me that if you wanted to commit suicide,

1553
01:55:11,072 --> 01:55:13,992
you'd go to all the trouble
of putting out to sea in a boat,

1554
01:55:14,075 --> 01:55:17,579
then take a hammer and chisel and laboriously
knock holes through the bottom of it?

1555
01:55:17,662 --> 01:55:20,206
Come, Colonel, as an officer of the law,

1556
01:55:20,290 --> 01:55:23,585
don't you feel there are some
slight grounds for suspicion?

1557
01:55:23,668 --> 01:55:26,004
- Of murder?
- What else?

1558
01:55:26,087 --> 01:55:29,299
You've known Max a long time,
so you know he's the old-fashioned type

1559
01:55:29,382 --> 01:55:32,635
who'd die to defend his honor
or who'd kill for it.

1560
01:55:32,719 --> 01:55:34,762
It's blackmail, pure and simple.

1561
01:55:34,846 --> 01:55:37,432
Blackmail's not so pure nor so simple.

1562
01:55:37,515 --> 01:55:40,101
It can bring a lot of trouble
to a great many people,

1563
01:55:40,184 --> 01:55:42,937
and the blackmailer sometimes
finds himself in jail at the end of it.

1564
01:55:43,021 --> 01:55:45,940
I see. You're going to hold
de Winter's hand through all this

1565
01:55:46,024 --> 01:55:50,361
just because he's the big noise around here
and he's actually permitted you to dine with him.

1566
01:55:50,445 --> 01:55:52,989
Be careful, Favell.
You've brought an accusation of murder.

1567
01:55:53,072 --> 01:55:55,700
- Have you any witnesses?
- I do have a witness.

1568
01:55:55,783 --> 01:55:57,410
It's that fellow Ben.

1569
01:55:57,493 --> 01:55:59,829
If that stupid coroner hadn't been
as much of a snob as you are,

1570
01:55:59,912 --> 01:56:01,873
he'd have seen that half-wit
was hiding something.

1571
01:56:01,956 --> 01:56:03,291
And why should Ben do that?

1572
01:56:03,374 --> 01:56:06,794
Because we caught him once, Rebecca and I,
peering at us through the cottage window.

1573
01:56:06,878 --> 01:56:09,297
Rebecca threatened him with the asylum.
That's why he was afraid to speak.

1574
01:56:09,380 --> 01:56:12,050
But he was always hanging about.
He must have seen this whole thing.

1575
01:56:12,133 --> 01:56:13,926
It's ridiculous even listening to all this.

1576
01:56:14,010 --> 01:56:17,639
Ah. You're like a little trades union,
all of you, aren't you?

1577
01:56:17,722 --> 01:56:19,641
And if my guess is right, Crawley,

1578
01:56:19,724 --> 01:56:23,019
there's a bit of malice in your soul
toward me, isn't there?

1579
01:56:23,102 --> 01:56:26,105
Crawley didn't have much success
with Rebecca,

1580
01:56:26,189 --> 01:56:29,192
but he ought to have
more luck this time.

1581
01:56:29,275 --> 01:56:32,487
The bride will be grateful
for your fraternal arm, Crawley,

1582
01:56:32,570 --> 01:56:33,946
in a week or so.

1583
01:56:34,030 --> 01:56:36,324
- Every time she faints, in fact.
- De Winter!

1584
01:56:36,407 --> 01:56:37,450
Maxim, please!

1585
01:56:38,826 --> 01:56:40,912
That temper of yours
will do you in yet, Max.

1586
01:56:44,415 --> 01:56:46,584
Oh, uh, excuse me, gentlemen.

1587
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:49,796
Now, is there anything else?

1588
01:56:49,879 --> 01:56:53,049
Yes. You might bring
Mr. de Winter a sedative.

1589
01:56:53,132 --> 01:56:55,593
- No, no, nothing at all. Just leave us.
- Very good, sir.

1590
01:56:59,055 --> 01:57:01,182
Now, Favell, let's get this business over.

1591
01:57:01,265 --> 01:57:03,059
As you seem to have worked out
the whole thing so carefully,

1592
01:57:03,142 --> 01:57:05,144
perhaps you can provide us
also with a motive.

1593
01:57:05,228 --> 01:57:07,730
I knew you were going
to bring that up, Colonel.

1594
01:57:07,814 --> 01:57:11,526
I've read enough detective stories to
know that there must always be a motive.

1595
01:57:11,609 --> 01:57:15,071
And if you'll all excuse me a moment,
I'll supply that too.

1596
01:57:16,489 --> 01:57:19,158
I wish you would go home.
You ought not to be here through all this.

1597
01:57:19,242 --> 01:57:20,785
Please let me stay, Maxim.

1598
01:57:20,868 --> 01:57:23,079
Surely, Colonel Julyan,
you're not going to allow this fellow ‒

1599
01:57:23,162 --> 01:57:26,290
My opinion of Favell
is no higher than yours, Crawley.

1600
01:57:26,374 --> 01:57:30,378
But in my official capacity, I have
no alternative but to pursue his accusation.

1601
01:57:30,461 --> 01:57:32,171
I entirely agree with you, Colonel.

1602
01:57:32,255 --> 01:57:37,635
In a manner so serious as this, we must
make sure of every point, explore every avenue,

1603
01:57:37,719 --> 01:57:41,931
and, in fact, if I may coin a phrase,
leave no stone unturned.

1604
01:57:42,014 --> 01:57:45,893
Ah, here she is ‒ the missing link,
the witness who will help supply the motive.

1605
01:57:45,977 --> 01:57:49,647
Colonel Julyan, Mrs. Danvers.
I believe you know everyone else.

1606
01:57:49,731 --> 01:57:50,982
Won't you sit down?

1607
01:57:51,065 --> 01:57:53,317
No offense, Colonel,
but I think I'll put this to Danny.

1608
01:57:53,401 --> 01:57:57,196
She'll understand it more easily.
Danny, who was Rebecca's doctor?

1609
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:59,532
Mrs. de Winter
always had Dr. McClean from the village.

1610
01:57:59,615 --> 01:58:03,286
Now, you heard.
I said Rebecca's doctor, in London.

1611
01:58:05,288 --> 01:58:07,749
- I don't know anything about that.
- Oh, don't give me that, Danny.

1612
01:58:07,832 --> 01:58:11,335
You knew everything about Rebecca.
You knew she was in love with me, didn't you?

1613
01:58:11,419 --> 01:58:16,174
Surely you haven't forgotten the good times
she and I used to have down at the cottage.

1614
01:58:16,257 --> 01:58:18,634
She had a right to amuse herself,
didn't she?

1615
01:58:18,718 --> 01:58:22,180
Love was a game to her. Only a game.
It made her laugh, I tell you.

1616
01:58:22,263 --> 01:58:25,016
She used to sit on her bed
and rock with laughter at the lot of you.

1617
01:58:25,099 --> 01:58:29,020
Can you think of any reason why
Mrs. de Winter should have taken her own life?

1618
01:58:29,103 --> 01:58:30,772
No, no, I refuse to believe it.

1619
01:58:30,855 --> 01:58:33,024
I knew everything about her,
and I won't believe it.

1620
01:58:33,107 --> 01:58:35,860
There, you see? It's impossible.
She knows that as well as I do.

1621
01:58:35,943 --> 01:58:39,530
Now, listen. We know that Rebecca went to
a doctor in London on the last day of her life.

1622
01:58:39,614 --> 01:58:42,325
- Who was it?
- I don't know.

1623
01:58:42,408 --> 01:58:44,368
Oh, I understand, Danny.

1624
01:58:44,452 --> 01:58:47,497
You think we're asking you
to reveal secrets of Rebecca's life.

1625
01:58:47,580 --> 01:58:49,999
You're trying to defend her.
But that's what I'm doing.

1626
01:58:50,082 --> 01:58:52,627
I'm trying to clear her name
of the suspicion of suicide.

1627
01:58:52,710 --> 01:58:56,005
Mrs. Danvers, it has been suggested...

1628
01:58:56,798 --> 01:58:58,800
that Mrs. de Winter
was deliberately murdered.

1629
01:58:58,883 --> 01:59:00,676
There you have it in a nutshell, Danny.

1630
01:59:00,760 --> 01:59:03,721
But there's one more thing you'll want to know:
the name of the murderer.

1631
01:59:03,805 --> 01:59:06,682
It's a lovely name
that rolls off the tongue so easily:

1632
01:59:06,766 --> 01:59:10,061
George Fortescue Maximilian de Winter.

1633
01:59:16,359 --> 01:59:20,029
There was a doctor. Mrs. de Winter
sometimes went to him privately.

1634
01:59:20,112 --> 01:59:22,365
She used to go to him
even before she was married.

1635
01:59:22,448 --> 01:59:24,700
We don't want reminiscences, Danny.
What was his name?

1636
01:59:33,876 --> 01:59:37,088
Dr. Baker, 165 Goldhawk Road,
Shepherd's Bush.

1637
01:59:37,171 --> 01:59:39,757
There you are, Colonel.
There's where you'll find your motive.

1638
01:59:39,841 --> 01:59:43,052
Go and question Dr. Baker.
He'll tell you why Rebecca went to him ‒

1639
01:59:43,135 --> 01:59:45,388
to confirm the fact that
she was going to have a child,

1640
01:59:45,471 --> 01:59:47,932
a sweet, curly-headed little child.

1641
01:59:48,015 --> 01:59:50,810
It isn't true. It isn't true.
She would have told me.

1642
01:59:50,893 --> 01:59:53,563
She told Max about it.
Maxim knew he wasn't the father.

1643
01:59:53,646 --> 01:59:56,983
So, like the gentleman of the old school
that he is, he killed her.

1644
01:59:57,066 --> 01:59:59,694
I'm afraid we shall have
to question this Dr. Baker.

1645
01:59:59,777 --> 02:00:03,823
Hear, hear. But for safety's sake,
I think I'd like to go along too.

1646
02:00:03,906 --> 02:00:07,159
Yes, unfortunately, I suppose
you have the right to ask that.

1647
02:00:07,243 --> 02:00:10,538
I'll see the coroner and have the inquest
postponed pending further evidence.

1648
02:00:10,621 --> 02:00:14,500
I say, aren't you rather afraid that
the prisoner, shall we say, might bolt?

1649
02:00:14,584 --> 02:00:17,837
You have my word for it
that he will not do that.

1650
02:00:19,046 --> 02:00:20,631
Toodle-oo, Max.
Come along, Danny.

1651
02:00:20,715 --> 02:00:25,011
Let's leave the unhappy couple to spend
their last moments together alone.

1652
02:00:35,980 --> 02:00:38,232
Are you sure you don't want me
to go with you, Maxim?

1653
02:00:38,316 --> 02:00:40,359
No, darling.
It'll be very tiring for you.

1654
02:00:40,443 --> 02:00:44,155
I'll be back the very first thing in the morning,
and I won't even stop to sleep.

1655
02:00:44,238 --> 02:00:46,407
I'll be waiting for you.

1656
02:00:51,954 --> 02:00:54,498
- Ready, Maxim?
- Yes.

1657
02:00:54,582 --> 02:00:57,418
You two go on ahead.
I'll follow with Favell.

1658
02:01:11,057 --> 02:01:15,561
Dr. Baker, you may have seen
Mr. de Winter's name in the papers recently.

1659
02:01:15,645 --> 02:01:19,440
Oh, yes, yes. In connection with a body
that was found in a boat.

1660
02:01:19,523 --> 02:01:22,443
My wife was reading all about it.
A very sad case.

1661
02:01:22,526 --> 02:01:24,904
- My condolences ‒
- Oh, this is going to take hours. Let me ‒

1662
02:01:24,987 --> 02:01:27,823
Don't bother, Favell.
I think I can tell Dr. Baker.

1663
02:01:27,907 --> 02:01:30,159
We're trying to discover certain facts

1664
02:01:30,242 --> 02:01:33,579
concerning the late Mrs. de Winter's
activities on the day of her death,

1665
02:01:33,663 --> 02:01:37,083
October 12, last year,
and I want you to tell me, if you can,

1666
02:01:37,166 --> 02:01:40,461
if anyone of that name
paid you a visit on that date.

1667
02:01:40,544 --> 02:01:43,631
I'm awfully sorry.
I'm afraid I can't help you.

1668
02:01:43,714 --> 02:01:46,175
I should have remembered
the name de Winter.

1669
02:01:46,258 --> 02:01:48,678
I've never attended
a Mrs. de Winter in my life.

1670
02:01:48,761 --> 02:01:51,681
Well, how can you possibly tell
all your patients' names?

1671
02:01:51,764 --> 02:01:55,101
I can look it up
in my engagement diary if you like.

1672
02:01:55,184 --> 02:01:58,270
- Did you say the 12th of October?
- Yes.

1673
02:01:58,354 --> 02:02:03,067
Oh, here we are.
No, no de Winter.

1674
02:02:03,150 --> 02:02:07,238
- Are you sure?
- Well, here are all the appointments for that day.

1675
02:02:07,321 --> 02:02:10,449
"Ross, Campbell, Steadall,
Perrino, Danvers, Mathews ‒"

1676
02:02:10,533 --> 02:02:12,576
Danny! What the devil!

1677
02:02:12,660 --> 02:02:16,414
Would you read that name again?
Did you say "Danvers"?

1678
02:02:16,497 --> 02:02:19,125
Yes, I have a Mrs. Danvers for 3:00.

1679
02:02:19,208 --> 02:02:21,544
What did she look like?
Can you remember?

1680
02:02:21,627 --> 02:02:24,880
Yes, I remember her quite well.
She was a very beautiful woman ‒

1681
02:02:24,964 --> 02:02:27,883
tall, dark, exquisitely dressed.

1682
02:02:27,967 --> 02:02:31,220
- Rebecca.
- The lady must have used an assumed name.

1683
02:02:31,303 --> 02:02:33,431
Is that so?

1684
02:02:33,514 --> 02:02:36,934
This is a surprise.
I'd known her a long time.

1685
02:02:37,018 --> 02:02:38,853
What was the matter with her?

1686
02:02:38,936 --> 02:02:40,855
My dear sir, there are certain ethics.

1687
02:02:40,938 --> 02:02:44,734
Could you supply a reason, Dr. Baker,
for Mrs. de Winter's suicide?

1688
02:02:44,817 --> 02:02:47,737
For her murder, you mean.
She was going to have a kid, wasn't she?

1689
02:02:47,820 --> 02:02:49,405
Come on, out with it!

1690
02:02:49,488 --> 02:02:52,408
Tell me what else a woman of her class
be doing in a dump like this?

1691
02:02:52,491 --> 02:02:55,745
I take it the official nature of this visit
makes it necessary for me to ‒

1692
02:02:55,828 --> 02:02:59,874
I assure you we'd not be troubling you
if it were not necessary.

1693
02:02:59,957 --> 02:03:02,418
You want to know
if I can suggest any motive

1694
02:03:02,501 --> 02:03:05,171
as to why Mrs. de Winter
should have taken her life?

1695
02:03:05,254 --> 02:03:06,589
Yes, I think I can.

1696
02:03:10,259 --> 02:03:13,971
The woman who called herself Mrs. Danvers
was very seriously ill.

1697
02:03:15,306 --> 02:03:17,516
She was not going to have a child?

1698
02:03:17,600 --> 02:03:21,896
That was what she thought,
but my diagnosis was different.

1699
02:03:21,979 --> 02:03:27,193
I sent her to a well-known specialist
for an examination and X-rays,

1700
02:03:27,276 --> 02:03:30,446
and on this date
she returned to me for his report.

1701
02:03:30,529 --> 02:03:34,450
I remember her standing here,
holding out her hand for the photograph.

1702
02:03:34,533 --> 02:03:36,702
"I want to know the truth," she said.

1703
02:03:36,786 --> 02:03:39,705
"I don't want soft words
and a bedside manner.

1704
02:03:39,789 --> 02:03:42,458
If I'm for it, you can tell me right away."

1705
02:03:42,541 --> 02:03:45,127
I knew she was not the type
to accept a lie.

1706
02:03:45,211 --> 02:03:48,005
She'd asked for the truth,
so I let her have it.

1707
02:03:48,089 --> 02:03:52,218
She thanked me and I never saw her again,
so I assumed that ‒

1708
02:03:52,301 --> 02:03:53,719
What was wrong with her?

1709
02:03:53,803 --> 02:03:55,429
Cancer.

1710
02:03:57,973 --> 02:04:00,142
Yes, the growth was deep-rooted.

1711
02:04:00,226 --> 02:04:03,187
An operation would have been
no earthly use at all.

1712
02:04:03,270 --> 02:04:05,981
In a short time,
she would have been under morphia.

1713
02:04:06,065 --> 02:04:09,568
There was nothing that could
be done for her, except wait.

1714
02:04:09,652 --> 02:04:13,489
Did she say anything when you told her?

1715
02:04:14,448 --> 02:04:17,118
She smiled in a queer sort of way.

1716
02:04:17,201 --> 02:04:20,204
Your wife was a wonderful woman,
Mr. de Winter.

1717
02:04:20,287 --> 02:04:22,581
And, oh, yes,
I remember she said something

1718
02:04:22,665 --> 02:04:25,876
that struck me as being
very peculiar at the time.

1719
02:04:25,960 --> 02:04:28,170
When I told her it was a matter of months,

1720
02:04:28,254 --> 02:04:31,215
she said,
"Oh, no, Doctor, not that long."

1721
02:04:34,426 --> 02:04:37,680
You've been very kind.
You've told us all we wanted to know.

1722
02:04:37,763 --> 02:04:40,099
We shall probably need
an official verification.

1723
02:04:40,182 --> 02:04:43,227
- Verification?
- Yes, to confirm the verdict of suicide.

1724
02:04:43,310 --> 02:04:46,272
I understand.
Can I offer you gentlemen a glass of sherry?

1725
02:04:46,355 --> 02:04:48,732
No, very kind.
I think we ought to be going.

1726
02:04:52,236 --> 02:04:54,196
Thank heaven we know the truth.

1727
02:04:54,280 --> 02:04:56,198
Dreadful thing, dreadful.

1728
02:04:56,282 --> 02:04:59,118
A young and lovely woman like her.
No wonder ‒

1729
02:04:59,201 --> 02:05:03,706
I never had the remotest idea.
Neither did Danny, I'm sure.

1730
02:05:05,082 --> 02:05:07,293
I wish I had a drink.

1731
02:05:07,376 --> 02:05:09,295
Will we be needed at the inquest
any further, Colonel Julyan?

1732
02:05:09,378 --> 02:05:12,339
Oh, no. I can see to it that Maxim
is not troubled any further.

1733
02:05:12,423 --> 02:05:14,508
- Thank you, sir.
- Are you ready to start, Colonel?

1734
02:05:14,592 --> 02:05:17,219
No, thank you.
I'm staying in town tonight.

1735
02:05:17,303 --> 02:05:21,098
And let me tell you, Favell,
blackmail is not much of a profession,

1736
02:05:21,182 --> 02:05:24,810
and we know how to deal with it in our part
of the world, strange as it may seem to you.

1737
02:05:24,894 --> 02:05:27,396
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

1738
02:05:27,479 --> 02:05:30,399
But if you ever need a new car,
Colonel, just let me know.

1739
02:05:30,482 --> 02:05:33,402
It's impossible to thank you
for your kindness to us through all this.

1740
02:05:33,485 --> 02:05:36,739
- You know what I feel without my saying anything.
- Not at all. Put the whole thing behind you.

1741
02:05:36,822 --> 02:05:39,158
But let your wife know.
She'll be getting worried.

1742
02:05:39,241 --> 02:05:42,119
Yes, I'll phone her at once.
Then we'll get straight down to Manderley.

1743
02:05:42,203 --> 02:05:45,039
Good-bye, Crawley.
Maxim's got a great friend.

1744
02:05:51,545 --> 02:05:53,881
- Frank.
- Yes, Maxim?

1745
02:05:56,383 --> 02:05:58,510
There's something you don't know.

1746
02:05:58,594 --> 02:06:00,387
Oh, no, there isn't.

1747
02:06:09,730 --> 02:06:11,607
I didn't kill her, Frank.

1748
02:06:12,650 --> 02:06:16,153
But I know now that when she told me
about the child, she wanted me to kill her.

1749
02:06:16,237 --> 02:06:19,406
She lied on purpose.
She foresaw the whole thing.

1750
02:06:19,490 --> 02:06:21,909
That's why she stood there laughing
when she...

1751
02:06:21,992 --> 02:06:24,453
Don't think about it anymore.

1752
02:06:26,997 --> 02:06:28,749
Thank you, Frank.

1753
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:34,380
Hello, Danny?
I just wanted to tell you the news.

1754
02:06:35,089 --> 02:06:37,132
Rebecca held out on both of us.

1755
02:06:37,216 --> 02:06:38,592
She had cancer.

1756
02:06:40,344 --> 02:06:42,012
Yes, suicide.

1757
02:06:43,347 --> 02:06:45,641
And now Max
and that dear little bride of his

1758
02:06:45,724 --> 02:06:49,687
will be able to stay on at Manderley
and live happily ever after.

1759
02:06:50,896 --> 02:06:52,314
Bye-bye, Danny.

1760
02:06:55,859 --> 02:06:59,280
- This your car, sir?
- Yes.

1761
02:06:59,363 --> 02:07:01,740
Will you be going soon?
This isn't a parking place, you know.

1762
02:07:01,824 --> 02:07:06,245
Oh, isn't it? People are entitled
to leave their cars outside if they want to.

1763
02:07:06,328 --> 02:07:09,415
It's a pity some of you fellows
haven't anything better to do.

1764
02:07:13,210 --> 02:07:16,005
When you phoned,
did she say she'd wait up?

1765
02:07:16,088 --> 02:07:18,882
I asked her to go to bed,
but she wouldn't hear of it.

1766
02:07:20,968 --> 02:07:23,804
I wish I could get some
more speed out of this thing.

1767
02:07:23,887 --> 02:07:25,848
Is something worrying you, Maxim?

1768
02:07:25,931 --> 02:07:28,892
I can't get over the feeling
something's wrong.

1769
02:08:16,523 --> 02:08:18,776
- Frank!
- What's the matter? Why did we stop?

1770
02:08:18,859 --> 02:08:20,611
What's the time?

1771
02:08:20,694 --> 02:08:23,781
Oh, this clock's wrong.
It must be 3:00 or 4:00. Why?

1772
02:08:23,864 --> 02:08:26,116
That can't be the dawn
breaking over there.

1773
02:08:26,200 --> 02:08:28,869
It's in the winter that
you see the Northern Lights, isn't it?

1774
02:08:30,788 --> 02:08:33,916
That's not the Northern Lights.
That's Manderley!

1775
02:08:57,398 --> 02:09:00,109
Frith! Frith!
Mrs. de Winter. Where is she?

1776
02:09:00,192 --> 02:09:02,111
- I thought I saw her, sir.
- Where?

1777
02:09:09,701 --> 02:09:10,744
Maxim!

1778
02:09:12,579 --> 02:09:14,581
Thank heaven you've come back to me.

1779
02:09:14,665 --> 02:09:17,668
- Are you all right, darling? Are you all right?
- Oh, yes, I'm all right.

1780
02:09:18,919 --> 02:09:20,921
Mrs. Danvers. She's gone mad.

1781
02:09:21,004 --> 02:09:24,133
She said she'd rather destroy Manderley
than see us happy here.

1782
02:09:24,216 --> 02:09:26,468
Look! The west wing!
