1
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,109
Get off.

2
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,037
Open the door.

3
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,543
Go inside.

4
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,714
Hurry up.

5
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,883
This way.

6
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,641
Hurry up.

7
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:23,614
Yeah, this'll do. Which
one are you gonna have?

8
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,908
- I...
- No, that's mine.

9
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,452
Come on... hup.

10
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,116
How far are the trees, Danny?

11
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:12,455
- Over 200 feet.
- Yeah, I'd say 300.

12
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,790
Long ways to dig.

13
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,961
We'll get Cavendish to make a
survey. I wish Big X were here.

14
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:21,881
Willie, you think X got away?

15
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:24,133
He'd have sent us word,
somehow, if he had.

16
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:27,470
- Gestapo, you think?
- Either that or he's dead.

17
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,905
- Group Captain Ramsey?
- Yes.

18
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:50,242
I am Hauptfeldwebel Strachwitz.
Will you accompany me, please?

19
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,162
- I'll look after your gear, sir.
- Right.

20
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,259
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.

21
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,221
Good morning, Group Captain.

22
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:14,100
I'm Captain Posen, Von
Luger's adjutant.

23
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,102
Since you're senior
British officer,

24
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:20,356
you are to be liaison between
the prisoners and the colonel.

25
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,401
He wishes to make clear to
you certain matters of...

26
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:27,905
- The word is "policy"?
- Yes.

27
00:07:28,073 --> 00:07:30,074
Thank you.

28
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:33,869
Come in.

29
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,714
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.

30
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:49,593
I am Colonel Von Luger.
Please sit down.

31
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,897
Group Captain Ramsey,
in the past four years

32
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:05,151
the Reich has been forced to spend
an enormous amount of time,

33
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,236
energy, manpower and equipment

34
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:10,156
hunting down escaping
prisoner-of-war officers.

35
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,701
At least it's rather nice to
know you're wanted, isn't it?

36
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,868
For us it's not a
matter for levity.

37
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:19,498
There will be no escapes
from this camp.

38
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,582
Colonel Von Luger, it is the sworn

39
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:23,836
duty of all officers
to try to escape.

40
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,255
If they can't, it is their
duty to cause the enemy

41
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:29,258
to use an inordinate number
of troops to guard them,

42
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,303
and their sworn duty to harass the

43
00:08:31,304 --> 00:08:33,345
enemy to the best
of their ability.

44
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,431
Yes, I know.

45
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,435
The men under your authority
have been most successful.

46
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:42,438
This man, Ashley-Pitt,
for example.

47
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:46,609
Caught in the North Sea, escaped,
recaptured, escaped, recaptured.

48
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:50,321
Archibald "Archie" Ives,
eleven escape attempts.

49
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,824
Even tried to jump out of
the truck coming here.

50
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:56,035
Dickes, William.

51
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:59,288
Known to have participated in
digging of 11 escape tunnels.

52
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,707
Flight Lieutenant
Willinski, four escapes.

53
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,501
MacDonald, nine. Hendley,
the American, five.

54
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:08,714
Haynes, four. Sedgwick, seven.
The list is almost endless.

55
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:12,718
One man here has made
17 attempted escapes.

56
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,137
Group Captain, this
is close to insanity.

57
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:18,182
- Quite.
- And it must stop.

58
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,560
Colonel, do you expect
officers to forget their duty?

59
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,274
No.

60
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,874
It is because we
expect the opposite

61
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,737
that we have brought you here.

62
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,157
This is a new camp.

63
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,911
It has been built to
hold you and your men.

64
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,553
It is organised to
incorporate all we

65
00:09:41,554 --> 00:09:43,832
have learned of security measures.

66
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,087
And, in me, you will not be
dealing with a common jailer,

67
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,340
but with a staff officer
personally selected for the task

68
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:53,509
by the Luftwaffe High Command.

69
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:59,598
We have, in effect, put all our
rotten eggs in one basket,

70
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:02,977
and we intend to watch
this basket carefully.

71
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,187
Very wise.

72
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:12,278
You will not be denied
the usual facilities.

73
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:16,865
Sports, a library, a
recreation hall...

74
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,869
And, for gardening, we
will give you tools.

75
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,789
We trust you to use
them for gardening.

76
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,875
Devote your energies
to these things.

77
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,586
Give up your hopeless
attempts to escape.

78
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:33,465
And, with intelligent cooperation,

79
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,385
we may all sit out the war...

80
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,556
as comfortably as possible.

81
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,811
What do you do here by the truck?

82
00:10:59,812 --> 00:11:01,076
I'm stealing tools.

83
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:04,455
- For stealing tools, cooler.
- I was only kidding.

84
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,915
- Oh, you're American.
- Yes, and you're a German.

85
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,793
Of course. Why do you
come to Germany?

86
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,942
Why fight for England, your enemy?

87
00:11:11,943 --> 00:11:13,922
Enemy? What are you talking about?

88
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,434
In 1812 they burned your Capitol.

89
00:11:16,435 --> 00:11:17,801
That's propaganda.

90
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:20,846
It's in the history
books. I read it.

91
00:11:21,473 --> 00:11:24,266
Now go away from here. If
you steal tools, cooler.

92
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,477
Yeah. No tools.

93
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,442
Hey, Virgil.

94
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:36,278
Hey, did you see the cooler?

95
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,197
Boy, is it ever a big one.

96
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,053
I think they expect
a lot of business.

97
00:11:40,054 --> 00:11:41,054
Yeah.

98
00:11:41,055 --> 00:11:42,826
Those two guys who were
with us in the old camp,

99
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,287
in hut 14, I can't find them.

100
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:47,832
You think the goons
left 'em behind?

101
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:48,833
I guess.

102
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:52,378
What were their names?
It was Jackson and...

103
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,630
- And Dexter.
- Dexter. That's right.

104
00:11:54,798 --> 00:11:57,383
I'm gonna see who else I can
find. I'll see you later.

105
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,785
Hey, Danny. Who are they?

106
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,788
Russian prisoners.
They cut down trees.

107
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:30,999
- They keep them here?
- No, they take them out.

108
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:35,504
Willie, cigarettes.

109
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,674
Danny and I have a
blitz in mind. Could

110
00:12:57,675 --> 00:12:59,403
you put on a brief
show for the goons?

111
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:02,364
Sure, man. What'll it
be? An all-out go?

112
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,075
- Choir practise?
- Knuckles?

113
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:08,370
- Yeah. Knuckles will be fine.
- Give him the coat.

114
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:11,843
What are you doing
with my coat, mate?

115
00:13:11,844 --> 00:13:12,844
What? It's mine.

116
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:17,212
- Are you pushing me?
- That's mine, you son of a...

117
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,976
Comrade.

118
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:38,275
Thank you.

119
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,953
Stop it. Stop this nonsense.

120
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:53,582
It's all right, mate. We're just
having a friendly little argument.

121
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,460
- No more fighting. No more.
- All right.

122
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:58,337
- Back in your huts.
- Yes, sir.

123
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,589
You, too.

124
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,092
Get away. Get back in your huts.

125
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:07,804
Go on.

126
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,598
Hey, Hilts. Looks
like there's only

127
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:43,632
one other American
in the whole camp.

128
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,385
Some guy named Hendley in
the RAF Eagle squadron.

129
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,054
Hey, you got something
going already?

130
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,641
See the way the goons got
those towers placed?

131
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,434
There's a blind spot
through the middle.

132
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:55,811
A blind spot?

133
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:58,814
A guy could stand at that wire
and not be seen by either tower.

134
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:01,817
They'd never see me,
especially at night.

135
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:02,985
You're crazy.

136
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,904
You think so? Let's
find out right now.

137
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,841
Now, the next step's
a little tricky.

138
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,752
You're not going out there?

139
00:15:27,753 --> 00:15:30,095
Not while they're
looking, I'm not.

140
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,683
I think I'll take a little walk.

141
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,228
Division march.

142
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,308
Comrade.

143
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:19,394
- Danny, you speak Russian?
- Only one sentence.

144
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,439
- Let me have it, mate.
- Yes vas lublu.

145
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,316
- Yes vas...
- Lublu.

146
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,069
Lublu? Yes vas lublu.

147
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,779
Yes vas lublu.

148
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:32,240
- What's it mean?
- I love you.

149
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,743
I love you? What
bloody good is that?

150
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,579
I don't know. I wasn't
going to use it myself.

151
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,264
Halt.

152
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,438
Out.

153
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,149
- Out.
- Nyet, nyet. Comrade.

154
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,360
- Your friend, yes?
- Huh?

155
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,528
Comrade.

156
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:12,948
And who vouches for you,
Lieutenant Willinski?

157
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,158
Get out, Sedgwick.

158
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,210
Thank you.

159
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,382
March.

160
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,197
Hold it, hold it.

161
00:17:58,161 --> 00:17:59,995
- Your name?
- Ives.

162
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:06,918
Ives. Ives. Oh, yes.
Archibald Ives. Scots.

163
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,588
The photograph doesn't
do you justice.

164
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:13,175
I'd like to see one of you
under similar circumstances.

165
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,702
I will not take action
against you now.

166
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:41,995
This is the first day here,

167
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:45,540
and there has been much
stupidity and carelessness...

168
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:47,959
on both sides.

169
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:09,064
Hey. Get out.

170
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:12,859
Do not shoot. Do not
shoot. Do not shoot.

171
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,573
You fool. To cross
the wire is death.

172
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:21,451
- What wire?
- This wire. The warning wire.

173
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:22,619
Oh.

174
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:25,330
It's absolutely forbidden
to cross it. You know that.

175
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:29,000
But my baseball rolled over there.
How am I gonna get my baseball?

176
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,170
- You first ask permission.
- Oh, ok.

177
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:34,798
Getting my baseball.

178
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:38,093
Stop this. Get over
the wire immediately.

179
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:39,594
- Ok.
- You stay there.

180
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,597
Out of the way. Out.

181
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,104
What are you doing
over here by the wire?

182
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:50,772
Like I told Max, I was
trying to get my...

183
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,482
Attention.

184
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:07,122
- What were you doing by the wire?
- Well, like I told Max...

185
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,627
I was trying to cut my way through

186
00:20:09,628 --> 00:20:11,626
your wire, because
I wanna get out.

187
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,795
Search him.

188
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,219
- Do you speak German?
- Yes, Colonel.

189
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,306
- Wire cutters.
- Yes, Colonel.

190
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,267
I have had the pleasure of knowing

191
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:30,395
quite a number of British
officers in this war.

192
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,397
And I flatter myself that
we understand one another.

193
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,991
You are the first American officer
I have met. Hilts, isn't it?

194
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,993
Captain Hilts, actually.

195
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,037
- Seventeen escape attempts.
- Eighteen, sir.

196
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,206
- Tunnel man, engineer.
- Flier.

197
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:54,586
I suppose what's called in the
American army a "hotshot pilot."

198
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,088
Unfortunately, you
were shot down anyway.

199
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,008
So we are both grounded for
the duration of the war.

200
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,844
Well, you speak for
yourself, Colonel.

201
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:10,393
- You have other plans?
- I haven't seen Berlin yet.

202
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,562
I plan on doing so
before the war's over.

203
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:17,233
Are all American officers
so ill-mannered?

204
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:21,321
- About 99 percent.
- Perhaps while you are with us,

205
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:26,117
you will have a chance to learn
some. Ten days isolation, Hilts.

206
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,037
- Captain Hilts.
- Twenty days.

207
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,538
Right.

208
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,210
Oh, you'll still be
here when I get out?

209
00:21:35,378 --> 00:21:37,545
Cooler.

210
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,973
- Name?
- Ives.

211
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,143
- Flying Officer Ives.
- Cooler, 20 days.

212
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,899
- Cooler, Ives.
- Pleasure.

213
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:38,708
- Hilts.
- Yeah?

214
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:42,212
What did you do in the
States? Play baseball?

215
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,380
No, I was in college.

216
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:47,342
- Say, Ives.
- Aye?

217
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:51,554
- How many escapes have you tried?
- Four over, seven under.

218
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:57,018
- Tunnel man, huh?
- Sure, I am that.

219
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:03,024
- How tall are you, Ives?
- Five feet four. Why?

220
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,693
Oh, just wondering.

221
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,907
What did you do in college?
Study physical education?

222
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,701
Chemical engineering. Did a
little bike riding, though.

223
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:17,872
- Bicycles?
- Motorcycles.

224
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,751
Flat tracks, county fairs.
Picked up a buck here and there.

225
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,281
Helped pay my tuition.

226
00:24:23,282 --> 00:24:25,380
I did a wee bit of racing myself.

227
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:27,048
- In Scotland.
- Bikes?

228
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:31,052
No, horse racing. Jockey.

229
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:39,227
Jockey.

230
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,816
Hilts?

231
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:48,403
Are you there, Hilts?

232
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:51,698
Yeah, I'm here.

233
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:54,742
Don't you have them in
the States? Jockeys?

234
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:58,288
- Sure.
- They were the days.

235
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:02,917
Saturday nights in towns like
Musselburgh and Hamilton.

236
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,087
You had to fight off the birds.

237
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,173
You know, birds.

238
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,258
Girls, man. Girls.

239
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:13,261
Do you not have
them in the States?

240
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:19,809
Hilts? Are you there, Hilts?

241
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,228
Ives.

242
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,941
What?

243
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,161
You know the kind of clay and

244
00:25:29,162 --> 00:25:31,779
gravel we got here
in the compound?

245
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,699
How many feet do you think you
could get through in eight hours?

246
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,069
I could go through this dirt here

247
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:39,537
like the bit on an
end of an auger.

248
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:43,374
But you know it's not the digging.
It's the shoring up with wood,

249
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:46,711
and getting the dirt out, that's
what you've to worry about.

250
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,756
No, it isn't, Ives. You don't
have to worry about that.

251
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:52,383
How are you going to
get the dirt out?

252
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:55,668
What do they call a
mole in Scotland?

253
00:25:55,669 --> 00:25:56,669
A mole.

254
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,599
Aye.

255
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,811
Well, what do you think?

256
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,523
I must say, it's an
interesting first 20 minutes.

257
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,525
I'd say we made
fools of ourselves.

258
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:13,488
As the sergeant out there says,
this is only the first day.

259
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,548
Eric.

260
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:36,761
Don't take too much notice. The
goons may not know who he is.

261
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:39,639
- I'll pass the word.
- I'll tell the old man.

262
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,185
He has arrived.

263
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,593
The prisoner Bartlett
is discharged

264
00:26:53,594 --> 00:26:55,863
into your custody,
Colonel Von Luger.

265
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,875
I suggest this prisoner be kept

266
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,546
under the strictest security
confinement permanently.

267
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:15,216
Make a note of Herr
Kuhn's suggestion.

268
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,719
We have reason to believe
he is the leader

269
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,887
of numerous criminal
escape attempts.

270
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:26,060
Squadron Leader Bartlett has
been three months in your care,

271
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:29,731
and the Gestapo has only
"reason to believe"?

272
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:33,735
If he once more falls into our
hands, he will not be so lucky.

273
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,252
Air-force officer
prisoners are the

274
00:27:36,253 --> 00:27:38,406
responsibility of the Luftwaffe,

275
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:43,911
not the SS... or the Gestapo.

276
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,914
At present, yes, Colonel.

277
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:50,626
That is why he is returned,
for the moment, to your care.

278
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,588
Of course, if the Luftwaffe
is not up to the task,

279
00:27:53,756 --> 00:27:56,799
the prisoners will find
themselves totally in our charge.

280
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:59,761
We regretfully are not so
professionally understanding.

281
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:07,518
Squadron Leader Bartlett,

282
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:12,690
if you escape again and be
caught, you will be shot.

283
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,693
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

284
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:22,533
Heil Hitler.

285
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:29,290
Herr Kuhn.

286
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:54,190
Take these things off the man.

287
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,167
- Eric.
- Hello, Roger.

288
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:15,837
- They dumped you here, too.
- What's this one like?

289
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:18,005
Well, it's new.

290
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:22,510
- Here. Let's find you a bed.
- Thanks.

291
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,529
Come in.

292
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:45,575
- Hello, Roger.
- Hello, sir.

293
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:50,371
- I'll put your bag in your room.
- Thanks, Eric.

294
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:53,291
- How are you?
- As well as can be expected.

295
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,311
The fellows wanted
to put up a welcome

296
00:29:55,312 --> 00:29:56,878
committee, but that's for later.

297
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,485
I saw Willie and
Willinski with Mac.

298
00:29:59,486 --> 00:30:01,299
A lot of old friends here.

299
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,393
How long have you been here, sir?

300
00:30:03,394 --> 00:30:04,394
Arrived today.

301
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,138
New camp, expert
guards, the elite.

302
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,308
You met the commandant?

303
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,269
Yes, I did.

304
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:16,397
What were the Gestapo and
the SS doing with you?

305
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:19,108
They wanted to find out who
helped me to the border.

306
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:21,152
Who else is here? Cavendish?

307
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,113
- Nimmo and Sorren?
- Griffith, Haynes.

308
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:26,324
- Blythe?
- Yes.

309
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,410
Almost the whole X organisation.

310
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:32,289
Almost. They cleaned
out all the other

311
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,582
camps and dumped us in this one.

312
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:38,336
As Von Luger put it, "All the
rotten eggs in one basket."

313
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,589
There's madness in their method.

314
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,678
What about Tommy Bristol?

315
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,594
No, but there's an
American, Hendley.

316
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:50,181
Is he a scrounger, blackmailer?

317
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:53,100
- MacDonald says he's the best.
- Good.

318
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,314
Last of the tea until the Red
Cross gets through again.

319
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,691
I scrounged this from Sedgwick.

320
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,615
Did the Gestapo give
you a rough time?

321
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:11,619
Not nearly as rough as I
now intend to give them.

322
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,331
Roger, personal
revenge must be kept

323
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:17,458
out of what we have to do here.

324
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:20,127
Too many lives are at stake.

325
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:26,342
What my personal feelings
are is of no importance.

326
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:30,471
You appointed me Big X, and
it's my duty to harass,

327
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:33,182
confound and confuse the enemy
to the best of my ability.

328
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:36,477
- That's true.
- That's what I intend to do.

329
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,971
I'm gonna cause such a terrible

330
00:31:39,972 --> 00:31:42,149
stink in this Third
Reich of theirs

331
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:46,362
that thousands of troops'll be
tied up here looking after us.

332
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:47,780
How?

333
00:31:47,948 --> 00:31:50,866
By putting more men out of this...

334
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,911
perfect camp of theirs than
have ever escaped before.

335
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,606
Not two or three or
a dozen, but 200,

336
00:31:56,607 --> 00:31:59,000
300. Scatter them
all over Germany.

337
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,669
- Think that's possible?
- The men are here to do it.

338
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,276
The goons have put
every escape artist

339
00:32:03,277 --> 00:32:04,714
in Germany here. You
said so yourself.

340
00:32:06,508 --> 00:32:09,135
Have you thought of
what it might cost?

341
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:15,850
I've thought of the humiliation
if we just tamely submit,

342
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:18,394
knuckle under and crawl.

343
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:21,564
Surely you don't advocate
that, do you, sir?

344
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:24,442
I have to point out one
thing to you, Roger.

345
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:27,695
No matter how unsatisfactory
this camp may be,

346
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:30,865
the High Command have left us
in the hands of the Luftwaffe,

347
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:32,742
not the Gestapo and the SS.

348
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:38,748
Look, sir, you talk about the
High Command of the Luftwaffe,

349
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,541
then the SS and the Gestapo.

350
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:44,629
To me they're the same. We're
fighting the bloody lot.

351
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,714
There's only one way
to put it, sir.

352
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:50,343
They are the common enemies of
everyone who believes in freedom.

353
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,471
If they didn't approve of Hitler,
why didn't they throw him out?

354
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,640
I have no argument
with you, Roger.

355
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:00,561
As senior officer, I'm merely
pointing out a pertinent fact.

356
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,275
When are you calling a meeting, X?

357
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:16,494
Tonight.

358
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:29,715
Gentlemen, no doubt you've heard

359
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:33,928
the immortal words of
our new commandant.

360
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:36,597
"Devote your energies to
things other than escape,

361
00:33:36,765 --> 00:33:38,933
and sit out the war as
comfortably as possible."

362
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:40,434
Ha.

363
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,355
Well, that's exactly
what we're going to do.

364
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:47,650
We're going to devote our
energies to sports and gardening,

365
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:50,653
all the cultural pursuits as
far as they're concerned.

366
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:53,864
In fact, we're going to
put the goons to sleep.

367
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,618
Meanwhile... we dig.

368
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:01,997
Now, even a superficial
look at the compound

369
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:05,292
shows us that huts 104 and
five are closest to the woods.

370
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,878
The first tunnel
goes out from 105,

371
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,006
directly east under the
cooler and the wire.

372
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,300
But that's over 300 feet, Roger.

373
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:16,387
- Did you make a survey, Dennis?
- Only a temporary one, sir.

374
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,027
I make it just over 335 feet.

375
00:34:18,028 --> 00:34:19,974
Tell me when you've
got an exact one.

376
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:22,117
Willie, this time
we'll dig straight

377
00:34:22,118 --> 00:34:24,145
down 30 feet before
we go horizontal.

378
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,648
That'll rule out any question
of sound detection or probing.

379
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:31,068
All right, Roger, but... did
you say the first tunnel?

380
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:34,280
I did. There'll be three.

381
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:37,555
We'll call them Tom,
Dick and Harry.

382
00:34:37,556 --> 00:34:39,577
Tom goes out directly
east from 104.

383
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,328
Dick goes north from the kitchen,

384
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,874
and Harry goes out
parallel to Tom from 105.

385
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:49,545
If the goons find one,
we'll move into the other.

386
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,173
How many men do you plan
to take out, Roger?

387
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:54,842
Two hundred and fifty.

388
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,882
There'll be no half
measures this time.

389
00:34:58,883 --> 00:35:01,015
Identification
papers for everyone.

390
00:35:01,183 --> 00:35:04,351
And, Griff, we'll need
outfits for the lot.

391
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,854
- Two hundred and fifty?
- Mostly civilian clothes.

392
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:08,939
Yes, but...

393
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,151
ok, Roger.

394
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:17,072
Mac. Maps, blankets, rations,
compasses for all the walkers.

395
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,408
- Timetables for every train.
- Right, Roger.

396
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:28,417
- Sorry I'm late, Roger.
- It's all right, Colin. Sit down.

397
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:32,880
- We're going to tunnel.
- Splendid.

398
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:39,845
Willie, you and Danny'll be tunnel
kings. Danny, in charge of traps.

399
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:43,098
Sedgwick, manufacturer.
Griff, as I said, tailor.

400
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,643
Nimmo and Haynes,
diversions. Mac, of

401
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:48,145
course, will take
care of intelligence.

402
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,564
Hendley. We haven't met.

403
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:52,733
- Scrounger?
- Right.

404
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:56,237
Dennis, maps and surveys.

405
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,405
Colin, you'll take your usual job.

406
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,783
Eric, how are you gonna
get rid of this dirt?

407
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:05,955
Usual places. I hadn't anticipated
three tunnels, but we'll manage.

408
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:09,333
Roger, who's going to handle
security for all this?

409
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:13,587
You are. I want a system of
stooges covering this compound

410
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:17,633
from front to back, checking
every goon in and out.

411
00:36:17,801 --> 00:36:19,919
I want a signal system
so perfect that

412
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,929
if ever a ferret
gets within 50 feet

413
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:23,498
of any of the huts in
which we're working,

414
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,683
we can shut down without a sign.

415
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,522
Well, I don't think there's much
point in discussing any more now.

416
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,171
I'll meet each of
you on the exercise

417
00:36:34,172 --> 00:36:36,652
circuit, we'll pound
out the details.

418
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:43,409
- Nothing else, is there, Mac?
- I shouldn't think so, Roger.

419
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:12,855
Oh, hello. My name's Blythe.

420
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:15,441
Hendley.

421
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:20,613
For birds.

422
00:37:20,614 --> 00:37:22,990
I used to do a little
hunting myself.

423
00:37:23,158 --> 00:37:25,993
Oh, not hunting. Watching.

424
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:29,496
Oh, a... bird watcher?

425
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:33,375
Yes, that's right. Watching
them and drawing them.

426
00:37:36,171 --> 00:37:38,714
I suppose you have bird
watchers in the States?

427
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:40,966
Yes, we have some.

428
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,636
Tea?

429
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:47,306
I only drank tea once,
in the hospital.

430
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,727
- Where's your kit?
- This is it.

431
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:55,522
The rest was confiscated
in the last shakedown.

432
00:37:55,857 --> 00:38:00,778
The goons didn't appreciate some
of my more... personal items.

433
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:05,532
Such as.

434
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,328
- You're the scrounger.
- Yes, that's right.

435
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:12,206
I'll need a camera.

436
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:15,751
- What kind?
- A good one.

437
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:21,215
A 35mm f2.8 with a focal-plane
shutter should do all right.

438
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:25,052
All right.

439
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,554
- And film, of course.
- Oh, of course.

440
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,977
Oh, Hendley. I need a
pick. Big heavy one.

441
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,479
- Only one?
- Two would be better.

442
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:42,444
I'm afraid this tea's pathetic.

443
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:46,573
I must have used these wretched
leaves about 20 times.

444
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,284
It's not that I mind so much.

445
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:52,079
Tea without milk
is so uncivilised.

446
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:56,291
Yeah. I'll get our wood.

447
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,510
Close up. Close up.

448
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,603
Close up.

449
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:19,606
Close up.

450
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:20,941
Close up.

451
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:24,278
- No me sprechen the English.
- Close up.

452
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:51,138
Oh. Splendid.

453
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,987
- Blythe, what are you doing here?
- Oh.

454
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:10,991
I'm in Photographic Aerial
Reconnaissance Interpretation.

455
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:14,953
Went for a joyride to see for
myself. It's my own silly fault.

456
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:20,167
The aircraft bought it. Got
shot down. Terrifying.

457
00:40:20,502 --> 00:40:25,005
- No, I mean, what do you do here?
- Here?

458
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,216
Oh.

459
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,384
I'm the forger.

460
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:51,949
Forgers are installing themselves
in the recreation hut.

461
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:53,492
- Sedgwick?
- I'm in 110.

462
00:40:53,536 --> 00:40:54,536
Griffith.

463
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:57,162
Well, I'd like to
work in 109, Roger.

464
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:00,958
- 109? Right.
- I'll work in 107.

465
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:04,128
For now, Danny, Willie and their
trap team will be in 104.

466
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,354
I want to take a
chance on the tunnels

467
00:41:06,355 --> 00:41:08,465
and press ahead without
any shoring-up.

468
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:11,802
We will need timber for the
shafts and the entrance chambers.

469
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,638
Hendley figures there
are 36 empty bunks.

470
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,519
We can tear up 15 and move the men

471
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,433
around so the goons
won't miss them.

472
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,686
The rest will come from
strips off the wall.

473
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:22,563
Is Hendley taking
care of this himself?

474
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,772
Not yet.

475
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,984
He's working on some steel
for a pick that Danny needs.

476
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:47,171
Hey. What the hell
is going on here?

477
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,799
Turn the water off.
Get your hands away.

478
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:53,135
Get away.

479
00:41:54,137 --> 00:41:57,222
Hey. What the hell's
going on there?

480
00:41:58,141 --> 00:41:59,933
Stop this nonsense.

481
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:05,939
Get away. Turn the water off.

482
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:07,107
Somewhere.

483
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:50,150
In the stove, we keep
fire burning, always.

484
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:52,319
The goons will not
feel like moving it.

485
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:53,540
Good.

486
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:56,698
Hendley, two tiles,
they are chipped.

487
00:42:56,866 --> 00:42:59,993
- We need new ones.
- There's some in 113's washroom.

488
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:01,995
- Should match perfectly.
- Good.

489
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,882
It's going to be a
bit tricky, Danny.

490
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,177
Not when you're organised, Mac.

491
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,059
- We're ready.
- Big enough?

492
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:28,272
It's perfect. Right through
the middle of the foundation.

493
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,696
Good luck to us, Danny.

494
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,009
Why 17?

495
00:43:57,176 --> 00:44:00,220
This is the 17th tunnel
Danny's started.

496
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:33,879
All right?

497
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,896
It's good.

498
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:01,740
It's very good.

499
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,654
- Out.
- Get out.

500
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:43,615
- Get out.
- Out hier.

501
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:46,827
Out. Get done there.

502
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:55,544
You back there. Out here.

503
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:08,932
You're not in your hut?
What are you doing here?

504
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,142
Mopping up.

505
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:17,482
- And you?
- Shower. I need a wash.

506
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,364
I'm watching him. I'm a lifeguard.

507
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:26,575
Out.

508
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:32,539
Put on warm clothes. You
might be outside all night.

509
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:09,326
Out.

510
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:22,730
No. I vote no. Look, we've put the

511
00:47:22,731 --> 00:47:25,091
goons to sleep exactly
like you said.

512
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,599
But just one little
thing like this and

513
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,763
we're up the creek
without a paddle.

514
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:33,183
- Ives, sit down, won't you?
- Hello, sir.

515
00:47:33,351 --> 00:47:36,144
Hello. Squadron Leader
Bartlett, Captain Hilts.

516
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:38,939
Flight Lieutenant MacDonald.

517
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:42,567
I understand you two are
contemplating a blitz-out.

518
00:47:42,735 --> 00:47:44,819
Where'd you hear that... sir?

519
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:47,739
MacDonald. It's Mac's job to
know everything that goes on.

520
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:51,785
We thought, perhaps,
we might talk it over.

521
00:47:51,953 --> 00:47:54,246
Why? It's only a two-man job.

522
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,248
Everybody in the
camp is supposed to

523
00:47:56,249 --> 00:47:58,083
clear all escape
attempts in advance

524
00:47:58,251 --> 00:47:59,709
with Squadron Leader
Bartlett here.

525
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:03,213
We don't necessarily
want to interfere.

526
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:08,552
It's just that... Well, what sort
of blitz were you contemplating?

527
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:12,472
We sneak out at night to a spot I
found near the wire, a blind spot.

528
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,441
Then we dig down,
take the dirt, spread

529
00:48:14,442 --> 00:48:16,017
it on top so it won't make a pile,

530
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:17,894
and then straight out.

531
00:48:18,062 --> 00:48:20,022
Ives here is a tunnel
man, so he digs

532
00:48:20,023 --> 00:48:21,982
in front, pushes the
dirt behind him.

533
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,949
I stash it behind
me, then we burrow

534
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:25,944
through the dirt like
a couple of moles.

535
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:28,655
By dawn we're under
the wire, across the

536
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:30,949
open space, into the
woods and gone.

537
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:38,582
Well...

538
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,837
When do you intend to try this?

539
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:46,548
- When do you intend to try it?
- Oh, tonight.

540
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:52,137
Hilts, this may not be quite the
right time for this sort of thing.

541
00:48:52,305 --> 00:48:55,515
Look, sir, I've been in the
bag nearly three years now,

542
00:48:55,683 --> 00:48:57,892
bloody close to being wire-happy.

543
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:00,979
It's a blitz-out for
me, or forget it.

544
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:04,149
It'll work. I know it will.

545
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,533
Good luck.

546
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:15,744
Thank you.

547
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:19,297
Hilts, how do you breathe?

548
00:49:19,298 --> 00:49:21,750
We got a steel rod
with hinges on it.

549
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,544
We shove it up and make
air holes as we go along.

550
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:26,713
Good night, sir.

551
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:35,347
Now, why didn't anybody
think of that before?

552
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:38,933
It's so stupid, it's
positively brilliant.

553
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:42,062
But it'll bring every goon in
the camp down on top of us.

554
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,522
I don't know. Perhaps
we're being too clever.

555
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,650
If we stop all the breakouts,

556
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:50,403
it may only convince the goons
that we must be tunnelling.

557
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:53,114
I hope it works. If it doesn't,

558
00:49:53,282 --> 00:49:56,076
they're going to be in the
cooler for an awful long time.

559
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,916
- Good, huh?
- Danny, it's bloody beautiful.

560
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,007
This is the dirt
from the compound.

561
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,093
This is from the tunnel.

562
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:04,644
Wherever we put it, they're
going to spot it a mile away.

563
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:07,772
Maybe we could put it under the
huts. The dirt's dark there.

564
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,555
It's the first place
the ferrets would

565
00:51:09,556 --> 00:51:11,359
look. I saw one
measuring yesterday.

566
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:13,611
Maybe we could dry it
to the same colour.

567
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:18,074
- There are 50 tons of it.
- I was just thinking out loud.

568
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:21,494
If you must think, for
God's sake, think clearly.

569
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,622
Where the devil is Ashley-Pitt?

570
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:29,502
We can't destroy the dirt
and we can't eat it.

571
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:32,797
The only thing left to
do is camouflage it.

572
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:35,467
That's as far as my
thinking takes me.

573
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:39,262
Didn't they teach you
promptness in the RN?

574
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:42,390
You'll never believe it, but
I think I have the solution.

575
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:44,629
The problem is somehow
to get rid of

576
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:46,644
this tunnel dirt
over the compound.

577
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,813
Well, of course.

578
00:51:49,482 --> 00:51:51,524
Would you mind?

579
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:03,286
Now...

580
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:08,458
you fill these bags with
the dirt from the tunnel.

581
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:11,768
Then, wearing them
inside your trousers,

582
00:52:11,769 --> 00:52:14,297
you wander out into the compound

583
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:18,635
where you pull these
strings in your pockets.

584
00:52:19,512 --> 00:52:21,846
Out come the pins.

585
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:26,084
Eric, it's good.

586
00:52:26,085 --> 00:52:29,479
All you have to do is kick it in.

587
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:32,357
Unless you're a fool, the
ferrets won't see a thing.

588
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:35,485
It's indecently brilliant.
What do you think, Roger?

589
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:37,243
We'll try it first thing tomorrow.

590
00:52:37,244 --> 00:52:38,446
I already have. It works.

591
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:44,202
Mac, this is what we'll do.

592
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:02,262
- A little present from Tom, sir.
- Thank you, Nimmo.

593
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:12,856
Nice garden you've got, sir.

594
00:53:45,723 --> 00:53:47,849
All right. Let's look sharp.

595
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:56,149
That looks sharp.

596
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:02,280
Sir.

597
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:09,829
Please, gentlemen, continue. This
is merely a routine inspection.

598
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,680
- Good morning, Squadron Leader.
- Good morning, sir.

599
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:29,633
I am sorry the soil here isn't

600
00:54:29,634 --> 00:54:31,893
better suited to
your men's purpose.

601
00:54:32,061 --> 00:54:34,062
We'll manage, sir.

602
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:45,148
I must say I am surprised with the

603
00:54:45,149 --> 00:54:47,200
extent of this activity,
Group Captain.

604
00:54:47,368 --> 00:54:49,669
Pleased, of course, but surprised.

605
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:51,037
Surprised, Colonel?

606
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:54,662
Fliers are gentlemen,
not peasants to

607
00:54:54,663 --> 00:54:57,460
dig in the earth.
So I am surprised.

608
00:54:57,628 --> 00:55:00,514
The English are keen on gardening.

609
00:55:00,515 --> 00:55:03,633
Oh, yes, but flowers.
Is this not so?

610
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:07,011
You can't eat flowers, Colonel.

611
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:11,182
Good point.

612
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:31,119
I have the nasty feeling he
knows exactly what we're doing.

613
00:55:31,225 --> 00:55:32,225
Maybe he does.

614
00:55:32,226 --> 00:55:34,455
You don't really think so, do you?

615
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:37,250
If he does, we'll
find out soon enough.

616
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:50,847
- Morning, Bob.
- Andy.

617
00:55:51,015 --> 00:55:54,267
Here we are. Now, let's see.

618
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:56,936
Biscuits, two packets.

619
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:59,313
Coffee, two tins.

620
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,649
Bovril, one jar.

621
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:04,610
Cigarettes, six packets.

622
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:08,823
Strawberry jam, Sorren's.
Blackcurrant jam, Cavendish.

623
00:56:08,991 --> 00:56:10,992
And marmalade, mine.

624
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,091
Danish butter, Von Luger's. I

625
00:56:13,092 --> 00:56:15,621
liberated it from
his mess supplies.

626
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:20,418
Oh, yes. And Dutch
chocolate. Two bars.

627
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:24,672
That cleans out the gift food
for the entire organisation.

628
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,134
Now, the first thing we need is
the new form of travel permit.

629
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:30,970
The forgers have no idea
what it looks like.

630
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:32,513
I'll see what I can do.

631
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:36,184
And, of course, any other
identity cards, personal papers,

632
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,644
documents you can
put your hands on.

633
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,855
- Anyway, put 'em to work, Bob.
- Right.

634
00:56:41,023 --> 00:56:43,107
Good luck.

Louis, where the hell
is the air pump?

645
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:29,821
Patience is a virtue, Roger.

646
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:33,699
Yes, I know, but the diggers can
only work when the trap's open,

647
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:36,369
and this is holding
us up very badly.

648
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:40,331
- Is it finished?
- Of course.

649
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:43,501
- Why isn't it in?
- Working on the air ducts now.

650
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:45,661
Well, when will they be finished?

651
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:46,712
One or two days.

652
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,298
- Does it work?
- Of course it works.

653
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:53,719
- Will it give us enough air?
- As much as you'll need.

654
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:55,763
Mac.

655
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:58,015
Excellent.

656
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,434
Have it in by tomorrow night.

658
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:14,365

659
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:19,078
Thanks.

660
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:21,581
- It's pretty, isn't it?
- Yes.

661
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:32,425
Oh, I'm sorry. Would you like one?

662
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:37,847
I'll smoke it later, when
I'm off duty. Thank you.

663
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:41,100
You probably have a couple
of room-mates, huh?

664
00:58:42,144 --> 00:58:43,490
Beautiful day.

665
00:58:43,491 --> 00:58:46,939
Yes, but I think it
might rain later.

666
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:51,819
No, no. Red sky in the
morning, sailor takes warning.

667
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:53,696
Red sky at night,
sailor's delight.

668
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:56,115
It was a red sky last night.

669
00:58:56,325 --> 00:58:57,992
I never heard that before.

670
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,620
I learned it in the Boy Scouts.

671
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:03,122
- You were a Boy Scout? So was I.
- Really?

672
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:06,626
- Yes. I had 19 merit badges.
- I had 20.

673
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:11,422
I was working on my 20th when the
government abolished scouting

674
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:14,800
and sent me into the
Hitler Youth instead.

675
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:21,933
Werner, you think you'll stay
in the army after the war?

676
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,852
No. I'm not a well man.

677
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:26,854
- And my teeth...
- Your teeth?

678
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:30,191
Yes. I could tell you
stories about my teeth

679
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:32,109
that would make your
hair stand on end.

680
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:34,654
Our dentist here is a butcher.

681
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:38,616
But don't tell anyone I said so.

682
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:42,190
It's a soldier's
right to complain.

683
00:59:42,191 --> 00:59:44,497
Maybe in your army, but here?

684
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:49,502
One little criticism, and...
to the Russian front.

685
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:53,130
Is that so? Terrible.

686
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:56,008
That's terrible.

687
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:03,349
Werner.

688
01:00:05,978 --> 01:00:08,229
Why don't we go into my room?

689
01:00:08,397 --> 01:00:11,482
I'd better not. If
Strachwitz should see me...

690
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:16,821
I was just gonna make some coffee.

691
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:21,242
Real coffee.

692
01:00:49,438 --> 01:00:52,231
Coffee, coffee, coffee.

693
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:54,400
Where is it?

694
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,281
Jam. Is it wonderful.

695
01:01:00,449 --> 01:01:03,784
My grandmother keeps
sending me this stuff.

696
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:09,165
Oh, dear God, chocolate.

697
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:11,584
Oh, yeah. Here. Take one.

698
01:01:18,133 --> 01:01:21,802
- Von Lugers butter.
- Yeah. Keep it.

699
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:24,055
No. I must go.

700
01:01:24,765 --> 01:01:27,433
It's ok. You can keep
it. We're friends.

701
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:30,644
With you in the cooler, will we
be friends? I must report this.

702
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:32,938
I don't understand
you. Report what?

703
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:35,875
That you and I were
chatting in my room?

704
01:01:35,876 --> 01:01:36,876
I must go.

705
01:01:36,965 --> 01:01:39,028
Oh, here. It's ok. Look, keep it.

706
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:41,119
I'll never be able to eat it all.

707
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:42,615
No, I have to go now.

708
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:46,118
I'm sorry. All right.
Forget it. Forget it.

709
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:20,499
And that, I'm sure
you'll all remember,

710
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,613
is the voice of the
Nelles warbler.

711
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:25,991
Let's turn our attention to this
gentleman, the masked shrike.

712
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:28,411
Lanius nubicus. The butcherbird.

713
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:32,331
The shrike impales his foes on
the spikes of thorn bushes.

714
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:34,472
Not a very lovable
character, you see.

715
01:02:34,473 --> 01:02:36,293
Let's have a look
at the colouring.

716
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:39,797
Uniform black above,
from head to tail.

717
01:02:39,965 --> 01:02:43,008
A black rump, a black crown
with a bold white flash,

718
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:45,177
and a white line over the eye.

719
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:48,180
The shrike lives in
lightly wooded country...

720
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:52,476
Ah. Hendley. Sit down. You'll find
drawing materials on the table.

721
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:57,106
The shrike lives in lightly wooded
country, olive groves and gardens.

722
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:59,692
Well, Hendley, have you
taken to birds, too, now?

723
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:02,528
Yeah. Stick around. You
might learn something.

724
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:05,197
I have better things
to do than draw birds.

725
01:03:06,158 --> 01:03:08,953
The voice is a
monotonous succession

726
01:03:08,954 --> 01:03:11,370
of scratchy, complaining notes.

727
01:03:11,538 --> 01:03:13,480
Now, let's have a
good look at this

728
01:03:13,481 --> 01:03:15,207
bird. He's got a round shape...

729
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:37,534
On holiday certificate.
Permission to cross

730
01:03:37,535 --> 01:03:39,440
a frontier. Here's another one.

731
01:03:39,608 --> 01:03:42,109
Which one's the forgery?

732
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:45,571
- That one.
- That's right.

733
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:47,656
They both are.

734
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:51,327
What's holding us up now is the
new form of this travel permit.

735
01:03:51,495 --> 01:03:53,642
We've no idea what they look like.

736
01:03:53,643 --> 01:03:54,643
Here's one.

737
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:58,292
And a military identity card.

738
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:00,669
And a...

739
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:02,588
- a passport.
- Yeah.

740
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:05,132
Permission to be
on Reich property.

741
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:06,383
A ticket to Oden.

742
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:10,638
What appears to be the ferret
assignments for the next week.

743
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:13,557
You get ten out of ten
for this, old boy.

744
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:15,643
Thank you, sir. Take
good care of that.

745
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:20,773
- Where did you get this?
- It's on loan.

746
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:24,944
In order to get the right
amount of outfits, Roger,

747
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:28,447
I suggest that we work mainly
from service uniforms.

748
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:32,451
I can do double-breasts,
single-breasts,

749
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:35,496
and rather nice lounge suits.

750
01:04:35,664 --> 01:04:38,290
Lapels. I can do quite a
lot of things with those.

751
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:43,045
I can have them deep like
that, or high ones like that.

752
01:04:44,256 --> 01:04:47,258
Here's one that we're
working on right now.

753
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:50,135
Oh, yes. What about buttons?

754
01:04:51,221 --> 01:04:55,808
Take a look at those. Here's
one that I've finished, Roger.

755
01:04:57,852 --> 01:04:59,228
And...

756
01:05:00,689 --> 01:05:04,817
here's one that I dyed
with a bottle of blue ink.

757
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:08,988
It's rather good.
What's up, Roger?

758
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:12,157
The goons'd have a field day if
they crashed in on this lot.

759
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:14,357
That's Sorren's
department. Now, I've

760
01:05:14,358 --> 01:05:16,495
started working on
the other materials.

761
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:18,789
This blanket.

762
01:05:18,999 --> 01:05:22,001
Particularly the
stripes. Marvellous.

763
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:23,294
- Coats.
- Yes.

764
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:26,297
I've got the chaps working on
these all over the compound.

765
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:29,341
Those battle dresses, I'm
afraid they're a bit too short.

766
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:31,873
I'll have to get the
chaps to make those

767
01:05:31,874 --> 01:05:34,179
into some sort of
working man's outfits.

768
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:36,682
Blanket ticking.

769
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:41,395
Now, I've made these into
rather nice little waistcoats.

770
01:05:41,563 --> 01:05:44,247
Very dapper, yes. Dyed, of course.

771
01:05:44,248 --> 01:05:45,248
Of course.

772
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,693
Just take a look at this, Roger.

773
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:50,495
Now, this blanket
material, we scrape

774
01:05:50,496 --> 01:05:52,990
this down until
it's really smooth,

775
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:55,492
and then dye it with boot polish.

776
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:59,538
Corduroy scrounged by Hendley.
I wish we had more of this.

777
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:01,764
Where in God's name
did you get these?

778
01:06:01,765 --> 01:06:02,765
Hendley.

779
01:06:02,766 --> 01:06:04,960
- Where did he get them?
- I asked him that.

780
01:06:05,128 --> 01:06:07,755
- What did he say?
- "Don't ask."

781
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,883
Let me show you some of the
overcoats I've been working on.

782
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,915
- Good morning, Hilts.
- Oh.

783
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:47,753
Well, if you're here to find out
if I'm going out again, I am.

784
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:49,838
- When?
- Seventeen days, 7th of July.

785
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,882
- Dark of the moon.
- Correct.

786
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:56,428
- Is Ives going with you?
- Yeah, if he wants to.

787
01:06:57,430 --> 01:07:01,100
You know that Ives is
close to cracking?

788
01:07:01,893 --> 01:07:03,894
Yeah.

789
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:06,647
Better for him to go out
in the tunnel, huh?

790
01:07:06,815 --> 01:07:08,649
Safer.

791
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,447
Right.

792
01:07:17,826 --> 01:07:19,677
It's possible for
one man to get out

793
01:07:19,678 --> 01:07:21,328
through the wire, even get away,

794
01:07:21,496 --> 01:07:24,430
but there are in
fact a considerable

795
01:07:24,431 --> 01:07:27,126
number of people besides yourself

796
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:29,837
in this camp who are
trying to escape.

797
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:32,631
I appreciate that.

798
01:07:35,135 --> 01:07:37,010
Something's coming, I can feel it,

799
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:40,222
and it's coming right around the
corner at me, Squadron Leader.

800
01:07:40,974 --> 01:07:43,392
- My name's Roger.
- All right, Roger.

801
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,978
Yours is Virgil, isn't it?

802
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:49,565
Hilts. Just make it Hilts.

803
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:55,446
Yes, well... as I
was saying, Hilts,

804
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,907
we have maps of Germany,
general maps, that is.

805
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:01,083
We have all the
information we need

806
01:08:01,084 --> 01:08:03,203
for the escape routes
out of Germany.

807
01:08:03,371 --> 01:08:05,789
But what we do not have...

808
01:08:05,957 --> 01:08:09,168
Is a clear idea of what's 500
yards beyond those trees.

809
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:12,421
We've tried every goon
in the camp. No go.

810
01:08:12,589 --> 01:08:16,258
We must know the exact
position of the local town.

811
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:18,969
We want to know where
we hit the main roads.

812
01:08:19,137 --> 01:08:21,163
Where the police
stations are, where

813
01:08:21,164 --> 01:08:22,806
they've got their roadblocks.

814
01:08:22,974 --> 01:08:27,311
And, most important of all, we've
got to know how to get from here

815
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:28,937
to the railway station.

816
01:08:30,148 --> 01:08:33,484
No. Absolutely not. When
I get through that wire,

817
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:36,320
I'm not gonna be making
maps for you guys.

818
01:08:36,488 --> 01:08:38,489
I'm gonna be so far away,

819
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:42,034
you won't hear if they're
shooting at me with howitzers.

820
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:45,037
- Understandable.
- Completely.

821
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,875
I mean, I'd like to help, but...

822
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:55,839
Interesting idea.

823
01:08:56,007 --> 01:08:59,218
- How many you taking out?
- Two hundred and fifty.

824
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:04,348
Two hundred and fifty?

825
01:09:04,516 --> 01:09:05,933
Yeah.

826
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:08,560
You're crazy. You too.

827
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:10,607
Two hundred and fifty
guys just walking

828
01:09:10,608 --> 01:09:12,064
down the road, just like that.

829
01:09:12,232 --> 01:09:16,109
Well, some on the road, some
by train, some cross-country.

830
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:18,737
They'll have forged
papers, clothes,

831
01:09:18,905 --> 01:09:20,739
maps, compasses, rations.

832
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:23,575
You're gonna alert every
goon in the country.

833
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:26,954
Anybody that can carry a pitchfork
is gonna be out looking for you.

834
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:29,304
They're gonna swoop
down and scoop you

835
01:09:29,305 --> 01:09:31,375
up so fast it'd make
your head swim.

836
01:09:34,796 --> 01:09:36,713
Yes, well, thanks, anyway.

837
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:39,132
If I can help on the
tunnel, let me know.

838
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:42,261
- That's good of you.
- Any time.

839
01:09:43,471 --> 01:09:45,764
Wait a minute.

840
01:09:45,932 --> 01:09:48,934
You aren't seriously suggesting
that if I get through the wire

841
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:52,104
and case everything out there
and don't get picked up,

842
01:09:52,272 --> 01:09:54,857
to turn myself in and get
thrown back in the cooler

843
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:57,484
so you can get the
information you need?

844
01:09:57,652 --> 01:10:02,281
Yes. One has to ask some very
strange things in the job I have.

845
01:10:02,574 --> 01:10:03,884
We'll give you a front place.

846
01:10:03,885 --> 01:10:05,617
I wouldn't do that
for my own mother.

847
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:07,578
- I don't blame you.
- Well, ok, then.

848
01:10:07,787 --> 01:10:10,622
- It's completely understandable.
- Well, ok, then.

849
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:15,168
Yes, well, thanks, Hilts.

850
01:10:22,594 --> 01:10:24,595
Check.

851
01:10:27,348 --> 01:10:28,814
Herr Hendley, I...

852
01:10:28,815 --> 01:10:31,894
Oh, it's all right.
Blythe's a friend.

853
01:10:34,898 --> 01:10:36,189
What's the matter, Werner?

854
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:38,525
My wallet, my papers,
my identity card.

855
01:10:38,693 --> 01:10:41,945
Gone. I lost them. Everything.

856
01:10:42,822 --> 01:10:44,698
He lost his wallet.

857
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:48,368
Do you realise what would happen
if Strachwitz found this out?

858
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:50,662
- The Russian front.
- Dear, dear.

859
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:56,460
I've looked every
place, every place.

860
01:10:57,295 --> 01:11:00,672
I must have lost them
while I was in here.

861
01:11:00,965 --> 01:11:03,258
- No.
- Yes.

862
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:07,179
Look, I told you we were
friends. We'll find them.

863
01:11:07,347 --> 01:11:09,765
Oh, thank you, Herr Hendley.

864
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:12,768
Werner.

865
01:11:12,936 --> 01:11:16,021
Not now. It might look
a little peculiar

866
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:19,858
if you and I were seen probing
around at this time of night.

867
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:22,861
Look, I'll find them.

868
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:26,073
I promise you I'll find 'em if I
have to tear this room apart.

869
01:11:32,747 --> 01:11:35,290
- Thank you.
- Forget it.

870
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:36,875
- Werner.
- Yes?

871
01:11:37,043 --> 01:11:39,544
There is one small favour.

872
01:11:39,712 --> 01:11:41,004
A camera.

873
01:11:43,383 --> 01:11:47,052
We want to take some snapshots.
You know... keepsakes.

874
01:11:48,388 --> 01:11:52,557
35mm with a 2.8 lens
and a plane shutter.

875
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:54,351
Focal-plane shutter.

876
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:59,856
Werner, that's a
focal-plane shutter.

877
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:02,901
Let me know when you got it.

878
01:12:07,782 --> 01:12:12,244
He's a crazy, mixed-up kid,
that Werner, but I like him.

879
01:12:12,412 --> 01:12:14,454
Checkmate.

880
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:40,647
How soon's our air pump
going to be ready?

881
01:12:40,815 --> 01:12:44,276
- I'll have it for you tomorrow.
- You're badly behind schedule.

882
01:12:44,444 --> 01:12:46,653
- How's it coming, Danny?
- No good.

883
01:12:46,821 --> 01:12:49,489
- No good?
- Today, three times.

884
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:10,594
Willie, you all right? Pull.

885
01:13:39,207 --> 01:13:41,833
You're gonna have to shore up
the whole bloody tunnel, Roger.

886
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:47,380
- All 335 feet of it.
- Four times today. Foom.

887
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:51,551
This way we never get through.
We must have more wood.

888
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:55,806
It's a lot of timber,
Roger. Can you get it?

889
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:02,229
We'll get it. We've gotta get it.

890
01:14:02,814 --> 01:14:06,525
I'll put Hendley on it, and the
new man we got this morning.

891
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,693

I've never worked so hard
in all my life. Hi, Hilts.

915
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:37,490
Say, Cavendish...

01:15:37,617 --> 01:15:39,619

Never mind.

920
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,976
Here's a present from
our friend, Werner.

921
01:16:05,144 --> 01:16:08,980
Splendid. Simply splendid.

922
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:14,319
This should do very nicely.

923
01:16:15,863 --> 01:16:17,489
Those are Ashley-Pitt's men.

924
01:16:17,657 --> 01:16:21,826
He requested permission to dispose
of some of his dirt in our attic.

925
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:34,232
Tom has reached just beyond
that pile of wood, sir.

926
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,818
Harry, of course,
isn't as far as that.

927
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:40,739
- How much further to the trees?
- We make it 50 feet, sir.

928
01:17:40,906 --> 01:17:43,071
Dark of the moon is the seventh...

929
01:17:43,072 --> 01:17:44,242
Eighth and ninth.

930
01:17:44,452 --> 01:17:46,286
A day earlier in August.

931
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:54,419
Morning.

932
01:17:55,755 --> 01:17:57,422
There he goes again.

933
01:17:57,590 --> 01:18:00,175
Why is he buying up all
the potatoes in the camp?

934
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:03,178
I've been working on that,
but I can't find out.

935
01:18:03,346 --> 01:18:05,764
Hilts and Hendley lock
themselves in every night.

936
01:18:05,931 --> 01:18:09,100
Sometimes Goff's with them. Other
nights he's on guard outside.

937
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:13,271
Mac, we'll close down Dick
and Harry. Seal them off.

938
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:16,274
Put the entire effort into Tom,
and press on into the trees.

939
01:18:16,442 --> 01:18:18,026
Right, Roger.

940
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:06,991
Wow.

941
01:19:13,397 --> 01:19:14,397
Wow.

942
01:19:40,985 --> 01:19:42,185
Wow.

943
01:19:58,794 --> 01:19:59,794
Wow.

944
01:20:51,597 --> 01:20:52,889
About face.

945
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:55,767
Forward march.

946
01:21:02,890 --> 01:21:03,890
What is it?

947
01:21:03,891 --> 01:21:06,861
They're celebrating
the revolution.

948
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:09,030
It's the Fourth of July.

949
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:20,625
What the devil's this?

950
01:21:26,257 --> 01:21:28,466
Gentlemen, you're invited
for free drinks.

951
01:21:28,634 --> 01:21:31,032
A little present
from the colonials.

952
01:21:31,033 --> 01:21:32,262
Down the British.

953
01:21:32,429 --> 01:21:34,973
- Quite right, too.
- And a little drink to Tom.

954
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:38,977
- And to getting home.
- Very well. We accept.

955
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:40,770
- Up the rebels.
- Down the British.

956
01:21:40,938 --> 01:21:42,355
Gentlemen, follow us.

957
01:21:42,523 --> 01:21:44,607
About face.

958
01:22:04,211 --> 01:22:06,296
Company... halt.

959
01:22:10,134 --> 01:22:12,677
All right, let's
line up down here.

960
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:15,930
All right, grab a cup.

961
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:18,182
Line it up. Here we go.

962
01:22:25,316 --> 01:22:27,859
That explains what
happened to the potatoes.

963
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:30,987
No harm in closing down
Tom for one day, Roger.

964
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:33,865
I suppose it'll do us all good
to let off a bit of steam.

965
01:22:34,033 --> 01:22:35,658
There's only 14 feet to go, sir,

966
01:22:35,826 --> 01:22:37,869
and you can feel it
throughout the whole camp.

967
01:22:38,037 --> 01:22:41,205
- I think that calls for a drink.
- Hear, hear.

968
01:22:41,373 --> 01:22:43,249
- Drink it up.
- What is this stuff, Hilts?

969
01:22:43,417 --> 01:22:47,003
Moonshine. American
moonshine. Moonshine.

970
01:22:47,171 --> 01:22:49,422
Make my moustache grow. Cheers.

971
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:51,174
Keep it moving.

972
01:22:52,051 --> 01:22:54,218
Hello, Eric. Don't
spill any of that.

973
01:22:54,386 --> 01:22:56,929
- There you go.
- Down with the British.

974
01:22:57,097 --> 01:23:00,183
All right, old
cobbler. Keep it Mo...

975
01:23:00,893 --> 01:23:04,062
- Don't get any on your clothes.
- Cheers.

976
01:23:05,272 --> 01:23:08,066
- Don't spill any of that.
- Before your morning tea?

977
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:09,537
Keep it moving.

978
01:23:09,538 --> 01:23:12,528
Don't get any on
your clothes, sir.

979
01:23:12,696 --> 01:23:16,115
American moonshine. Don't smoke
right after you drink it.

980
01:23:16,283 --> 01:23:19,327
No smoking. No smoking
while you're drinking.

981
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:36,302
Get good and stoned, my friend.

982
01:23:38,597 --> 01:23:40,890
Keep it going. Keep it...

983
01:23:41,725 --> 01:23:45,186
No taxation without
representation.

984
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:47,814
Keep it going, boys. Keep it...

985
01:23:49,108 --> 01:23:51,693
Keep it going, fellas.
Enjoy yourselves.

986
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:55,530
- Well, let's drink to Tom.
- To Tom.

987
01:24:03,122 --> 01:24:05,207
In the three years,
seven months and

988
01:24:05,208 --> 01:24:07,291
two weeks that I've
been in the bag,

989
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:10,461
that's the most extraordinary
stuff I've ever tasted.

990
01:24:10,629 --> 01:24:14,424
- It's shattering.
- Well, I think it's rather good.

991
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:20,304
Well, with your permission,
sir, I think I'll all on kive.

992
01:24:21,807 --> 01:24:23,808
Call on Ives.

993
01:24:33,318 --> 01:24:35,319
Cheers, Hendley.

994
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:45,288
You know what that is?

995
01:24:45,456 --> 01:24:47,749
I'll tell you what it isn't.

996
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:50,209
It isn't Napoleon brandy.

997
01:24:52,004 --> 01:24:53,671
How do you like it, sir?

998
01:24:54,673 --> 01:24:58,634
- Well, it's...
- To the colonies.

999
01:24:58,802 --> 01:25:00,845
Independence.

1000
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:08,746
How are you managing
over there without

1001
01:25:08,747 --> 01:25:11,022
us? Getting along
all right, are you?

1002
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:14,066
We seem to be getting along
all right, shir... sir.

1003
01:25:22,326 --> 01:25:24,702
Yes, well, it's...

1004
01:25:25,871 --> 01:25:27,538
It's good stuff, Hilts.

1005
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,126
Thank you, sir.

1006
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:54,565
Danny. Here's to...

1007
01:26:01,949 --> 01:26:05,117
Roger, goons in 105.

1008
01:26:05,285 --> 01:26:07,411
- Who?
- Strachwitz.

1009
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:11,916
We have to ignore it.

1010
01:26:12,084 --> 01:26:15,586
If we pay attention, the goons'll
know the hut's important.

1011
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:18,589
Here's to going home.

1012
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:36,607
Come on, Danny. They've
searched it a hundred times.

1013
01:26:36,775 --> 01:26:38,818
Home.

1014
01:26:51,665 --> 01:26:55,376
Anyway, I'm glad we've got you
in the tunnel with us. To Tom?

1015
01:26:57,963 --> 01:26:59,338
Ooh, never mind.

1016
01:26:59,506 --> 01:27:02,133
You'll be walking down Argyle
Street in a couple of weeks.

1017
01:27:02,301 --> 01:27:06,804
To Tom. You know, Sandy, I'm just
beginning to realise that myself.

1018
01:27:06,972 --> 01:27:09,849
Why shouldn't you, man? We're
nearly at the trees, boy.

1019
01:27:10,017 --> 01:27:11,976
We're nearly at the trees?

1020
01:27:59,358 --> 01:28:03,653
Herr Hauptfeldwebel.
Herr Hauptfeldwebel.

1021
01:28:20,587 --> 01:28:22,713
So that's it.

1022
01:28:29,388 --> 01:28:31,347
Come on, get the guard.

1023
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:39,897
I guessed it.

1024
01:28:42,442 --> 01:28:44,777
Oh, my God. They've found Tom.

1025
01:28:58,834 --> 01:29:00,751
It's the tunnel.

1026
01:29:17,561 --> 01:29:19,562
Success.

1027
01:29:43,462 --> 01:29:47,131
- Ives.
- Halt. Halt.

1028
01:29:47,674 --> 01:29:48,758
Halt.

1029
01:30:55,826 --> 01:31:00,246
Sir, let me know the exact
information you need.

1030
01:31:00,997 --> 01:31:03,624
- I'm going out tonight.
- Right.

1031
01:31:05,877 --> 01:31:10,756
Open up, Harry. We
dig. Around the clock.

1032
01:32:48,521 --> 01:32:50,814
- Cooler.
- Right.

1033
01:32:54,027 --> 01:32:57,571
Well, I didn't think
they'd catch him so soon.

1034
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:01,116
He wasn't caught.

1035
01:33:14,673 --> 01:33:16,966
Hilts, welcome home.

1036
01:34:09,936 --> 01:34:11,936
Danny?

1037
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:27,911
Are you all right, Danny?

1038
01:34:30,373 --> 01:34:34,460
Yes. All right.

1039
01:34:36,588 --> 01:34:39,882
All right. Bring some
shovels. I'm all right.

1040
01:34:42,302 --> 01:34:44,720
For God's sake, you've
left out a whole eagle.

1041
01:34:44,888 --> 01:34:46,889
That's impossible.

1042
01:34:47,974 --> 01:34:49,975
Yes.

1043
01:34:50,769 --> 01:34:53,687
Four days' work up
the bloody spout.

1044
01:34:54,814 --> 01:34:59,109
- I'm sorry, Colin.
- It's all right, Smithy.

1045
01:35:00,153 --> 01:35:03,989
It's getting late. You push off
to bed. I'll pack up here.

1046
01:35:04,157 --> 01:35:06,075
All right.

1047
01:35:06,242 --> 01:35:08,786
- Good night, Colin.
- Good night, Smithy.

1048
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:51,453
I can't see a bloody thing.

1049
01:35:57,252 --> 01:35:58,252
Hut ab.

1050
01:36:00,547 --> 01:36:02,798
Very good. In order.
Thank you very much.

1051
01:36:02,966 --> 01:36:04,967
- Please, nice.
- Come in.

1052
01:36:08,304 --> 01:36:10,305
Heil Hitler.

1053
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:15,018
- What's your name?
- Erich Stressel, from Munich.

1054
01:36:15,186 --> 01:36:16,186
Why are you here?

1055
01:36:16,354 --> 01:36:19,731
I got a vacation.
My mother is ill.

1056
01:36:19,899 --> 01:36:21,410
Your German's very good.

1057
01:36:21,411 --> 01:36:23,735
Thanks, Mac. I've
put in a lot of...

1058
01:36:23,903 --> 01:36:27,030
Watch it. That's the easiest
way to trip up a suspect.

1059
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:28,198
Don't fall for that old gag.

1060
01:36:28,366 --> 01:36:31,034
- I'm sorry, Mac.
- Ok. But remember, German always.

1061
01:36:31,202 --> 01:36:33,203
Come in.

1062
01:36:44,716 --> 01:36:48,719
One, two, three, four, five.

1063
01:37:07,906 --> 01:37:08,947
Roger.

1064
01:37:13,953 --> 01:37:15,579
No, it's me.

1065
01:37:18,082 --> 01:37:20,042
How do you like the
old escape suit?

1066
01:37:20,210 --> 01:37:22,211
Fine, fine.

1067
01:37:24,464 --> 01:37:26,548
Colin.

1068
01:37:28,635 --> 01:37:31,053
How do you like mine?

1069
01:37:31,262 --> 01:37:33,597
It looks splendid.

1070
01:37:59,832 --> 01:38:02,000
Where are you going?
You'll get yourself shot.

1071
01:38:02,168 --> 01:38:03,854
What's the matter with you?

1072
01:38:03,855 --> 01:38:06,004
I'm going out through that fence.

1073
01:38:08,132 --> 01:38:11,510
Danny, we're getting out through
the tunnel. We're almost clear.

1074
01:38:11,678 --> 01:38:14,471
Please, Willie, let me alone.

1075
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:17,266
I can't go in that
tunnel any more.

1076
01:38:17,433 --> 01:38:19,810
So I'm going out through the wire.

1077
01:38:23,314 --> 01:38:26,984
Danny, think. We're getting
out, but not through the wire.

1078
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:30,153
We're getting out through
the tunnel. It's finished.

1079
01:38:30,321 --> 01:38:32,823
- I go out now.
- No.

1080
01:38:33,825 --> 01:38:37,160
Danny, you go through that
wire and you'll get killed.

1081
01:38:44,377 --> 01:38:46,378
Don't do that.

1082
01:38:48,548 --> 01:38:50,549
Willie...

1083
01:38:52,135 --> 01:38:54,303
Since I was a boy,

1084
01:38:54,470 --> 01:38:58,890
I hate... and feared little rooms,

1085
01:38:59,058 --> 01:39:01,184
closets, caves.

1086
01:39:01,352 --> 01:39:03,729
Danny, you've dug 17
tunnels. Over 17 tunnels.

1087
01:39:03,938 --> 01:39:06,189
Because I must get out.

1088
01:39:06,357 --> 01:39:09,526
I hide the fear, and I dig.

1089
01:39:10,528 --> 01:39:14,531
But tomorrow night in the
tunnel with all those men,

1090
01:39:14,699 --> 01:39:17,159
I'm afraid maybe this
time I will lose my head,

1091
01:39:17,327 --> 01:39:20,203
and ruin the escape for everybody.

1092
01:39:23,041 --> 01:39:25,042
So I go now.

1093
01:39:29,714 --> 01:39:32,716
Danny, I'll see you
through the tunnel.

1094
01:39:34,218 --> 01:39:37,763
I'll look after you. I'll
stick with you all the way.

1095
01:39:39,098 --> 01:39:41,058
All right.

1096
01:39:49,275 --> 01:39:51,276
- Good evening.
- Hello, Roger.

1097
01:39:52,195 --> 01:39:54,446
Well, how do you think we look?

1098
01:39:54,614 --> 01:39:58,116
Good evening, sir. How are you?

1099
01:39:58,284 --> 01:39:59,951
It's as bad as all that?

1100
01:40:00,119 --> 01:40:05,082
Colin, I want first of all
to say that without you,

1101
01:40:05,249 --> 01:40:06,750
we would not have been ready.

1102
01:40:06,918 --> 01:40:10,462
That's all right. I had lots of
help. Lots of very good help.

1103
01:40:12,256 --> 01:40:14,257
What's the matter, Roger?

1104
01:40:15,385 --> 01:40:17,719
You can't go.

1105
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:20,180
- What do you mean?
- I can't allow it.

1106
01:40:20,348 --> 01:40:21,348
Why?

1107
01:40:21,474 --> 01:40:24,309
You can't see your hand
in front of your face.

1108
01:40:24,477 --> 01:40:26,561
You'd be caught before
you got 10 yards.

1109
01:40:26,729 --> 01:40:29,106
That's ridiculous.

1110
01:40:30,108 --> 01:40:33,610
That's ridiculous. Never heard
anything so absurd in my life.

1111
01:40:33,778 --> 01:40:37,114
I can see perfectly.
I can see perfectly.

1112
01:40:37,782 --> 01:40:41,243
I can see... that pin down there.

1113
01:40:41,411 --> 01:40:44,162
- Does that satisfy you?
- What pin? Where?

1114
01:40:55,842 --> 01:40:59,136
Colin, do you see the
foot of the door?

1115
01:41:00,179 --> 01:41:01,638
Yes, of course.

1116
01:41:03,850 --> 01:41:05,892
Put the pin down there, will you?

1117
01:41:07,019 --> 01:41:08,478
All right.

1118
01:41:12,775 --> 01:41:17,112
All right. Come on.
Come on. Sit down.

1119
01:41:18,740 --> 01:41:21,658
Sit down. It was a good try.

1120
01:41:22,869 --> 01:41:26,663
I hate these last-minute letdowns,
but I've only just been told.

1121
01:41:26,831 --> 01:41:28,498
It's too risky for you.

1122
01:41:28,666 --> 01:41:30,500
Don't you think that's
Colin's decision?

1123
01:41:30,668 --> 01:41:32,836
- No, I don't.
- Come on, Roger.

1124
01:41:33,004 --> 01:41:38,341
We all know the score here. Well,
at least... most of us do.

1125
01:41:38,509 --> 01:41:41,636
Your idea of this escape
is to start another front,

1126
01:41:41,804 --> 01:41:46,016
to foul up the Germans behind the
lines. All right, that's fine.

1127
01:41:46,184 --> 01:41:48,493
But once we get past
that wire and have

1128
01:41:48,494 --> 01:41:50,687
them looking all
over Germany for us,

1129
01:41:50,855 --> 01:41:53,190
that mission is accomplished.

1130
01:41:53,357 --> 01:41:56,943
Afterwards, we have
some ideas of our own.

1131
01:41:57,695 --> 01:41:59,529
You mean getting home?

1132
01:41:59,697 --> 01:42:02,407
- Back to your family?
- That's right.

1133
01:42:02,575 --> 01:42:05,577
Do you really believe I haven't
thought about that, too?

1134
01:42:05,745 --> 01:42:07,746
I'm sure you have.

1135
01:42:08,915 --> 01:42:10,916
I know Colin has.

1136
01:42:11,918 --> 01:42:14,044
And, Roger, I have, too.

1137
01:42:14,212 --> 01:42:16,505
We think we can make
it all the way.

1138
01:42:16,672 --> 01:42:18,908
Not Colin. He'd be
an appalling hazard

1139
01:42:18,909 --> 01:42:21,259
to the escape. That
must be my decision.

1140
01:42:21,427 --> 01:42:25,514
Let's talk about hazard.
Let's talk about you.

1141
01:42:25,681 --> 01:42:29,684
You're the biggest hazard we have.
The Gestapo has you marked.

1142
01:42:31,187 --> 01:42:33,688
No one has said you can't go.

1143
01:42:35,066 --> 01:42:37,400
That's true.

1144
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:40,070
I have thought about the Gestapo.

1145
01:42:42,156 --> 01:42:44,017
But if you're asking me how far a

1146
01:42:44,018 --> 01:42:46,159
commanding officer
is allowed to go,

1147
01:42:46,327 --> 01:42:51,748
or dare go, or should be
permitted to play God,

1148
01:42:53,042 --> 01:42:55,085
I can't answer you.

1149
01:42:56,295 --> 01:42:58,046
But I can tell you

1150
01:42:58,214 --> 01:43:00,392
a blind man is an
unnecessary hazard

1151
01:43:00,393 --> 01:43:02,217
to himself and the whole plan,

1152
01:43:02,385 --> 01:43:05,428
and must therefore be
eliminated from the operation.

1153
01:43:16,482 --> 01:43:18,890
Colin's not a blind man as long as

1154
01:43:18,891 --> 01:43:21,653
he's with me, and
he's going with me.

1155
01:43:27,451 --> 01:43:28,910
It's all right with you, Colin?

1156
01:43:31,873 --> 01:43:34,958
Oh, yes. Quite.

1157
01:43:42,174 --> 01:43:45,310
Very well. I'll arrange
for your escape

1158
01:43:45,311 --> 01:43:48,054
numbers to be altered accordingly.

1159
01:43:48,973 --> 01:43:50,974
Good night, gentlemen.

1160
01:43:57,690 --> 01:43:59,733
Actually...

1161
01:44:00,818 --> 01:44:02,944
he's quite right.

1162
01:44:03,112 --> 01:44:05,155
He's completely right.

1163
01:44:05,573 --> 01:44:07,782
I really shouldn't go at all.

1164
01:44:07,950 --> 01:44:11,202
My eyes have been getting
worse and worse lately.

1165
01:44:11,370 --> 01:44:14,956
I think they call it
progressive myopia.

1166
01:44:15,374 --> 01:44:21,171
I can see things up here. Close
to. I can see to work, but...

1167
01:44:23,883 --> 01:44:28,511
- you're just a blur.
- I know.

1168
01:44:29,138 --> 01:44:31,598
Oh, hell. We'll make
it in great shape.

1169
01:44:31,766 --> 01:44:33,600
Colin, do you have any tea?

1170
01:44:35,102 --> 01:44:37,854
- Yes, of course.
- Then let's have some.

1171
01:44:39,315 --> 01:44:41,316
Splendid.

1172
01:45:00,211 --> 01:45:01,211
Out.

1173
01:45:27,196 --> 01:45:31,032
- Hi, Hilts.
- Hey, Mac.

1174
01:45:33,619 --> 01:45:35,161
When?

1175
01:45:35,329 --> 01:45:37,789
Tonight. We thought
they'd never let you out.

1176
01:45:37,957 --> 01:45:40,500
Me, too. Let's get at it.

1177
01:45:40,668 --> 01:45:43,545
- Bartlett's waiting for you.
- I'll be there.

1178
01:46:54,575 --> 01:46:55,825
What time?

1179
01:46:57,995 --> 01:47:00,121
Only eight minutes now, Danny.

1180
01:47:04,251 --> 01:47:05,335
You ok?

1181
01:47:16,430 --> 01:47:18,264
Cavendish.

1182
01:47:18,432 --> 01:47:19,766
Griff, down there.

1183
01:47:19,934 --> 01:47:21,935
Goff, there.

1184
01:47:41,831 --> 01:47:44,916
Smith, Foles, third on the right.

1185
01:47:45,751 --> 01:47:48,962
Blythe, Hendley,
third on the left.

1186
01:48:18,576 --> 01:48:20,201
There are the lights.

1187
01:48:21,954 --> 01:48:23,371
Right on the tick, Danny.

1188
01:48:33,716 --> 01:48:36,801
Look down the tunnel,
Danny. It's lovely.

1189
01:48:39,221 --> 01:48:42,807
It's just like Blackpool at
the height of the season.

1190
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:46,644
You ever been to Blackpool, Danny?

1191
01:48:47,313 --> 01:48:51,191
Yes. No.

1192
01:48:51,817 --> 01:48:53,818
I don't know.

1193
01:48:57,198 --> 01:48:58,364
It's time, Roger.

1194
01:49:11,503 --> 01:49:15,173
Bartlett, MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt.

1195
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:20,345
It's all clear, sir.

1196
01:49:29,188 --> 01:49:31,105
All set, Roger.

1197
01:49:43,619 --> 01:49:45,370
Roger.

1198
01:49:45,537 --> 01:49:47,580
Good luck.

1199
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:20,363
They're coming down
the shaft now, Danny.

1200
01:50:20,531 --> 01:50:23,574
And then they'll be coming
right up the tunnel.

1201
01:50:30,624 --> 01:50:35,920
Willie... I can't
wait. I must get out.

1202
01:50:36,171 --> 01:50:39,924
Danny. Danny. Danny. Danny.

1203
01:51:07,870 --> 01:51:11,289
What is it, Danny? What's the
matter? Danny. Come here.

1204
01:51:11,999 --> 01:51:15,001
Roger? Danny and I'll go later.
We'll take another place.

1205
01:51:15,169 --> 01:51:18,129
Danny, tell me what this
is, and tell me quickly.

1206
01:51:18,297 --> 01:51:22,300
This tunnel is mine as much as
anybody. I dug it. I built it.

1207
01:51:22,468 --> 01:51:24,635
I was buried many times.
I go when I want.

1208
01:51:24,803 --> 01:51:26,846
Let me out. Let me out.

1209
01:51:30,142 --> 01:51:32,435
Take him out, Willie.
Take him out.

1210
01:51:47,534 --> 01:51:49,577
Danny? What is it?

1211
01:51:49,870 --> 01:51:51,954
Danny, what's going on?

1212
01:51:52,122 --> 01:51:55,333
It's all right, Sedgwick. It's
all right. We're going later.

1213
01:52:01,965 --> 01:52:04,592
Danny, it's all right.
It's all right.

1214
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:08,596
We can take another place in
the line. It's all right.

1215
01:52:09,348 --> 01:52:11,349
All right, Colin. Down you go.

1216
01:52:11,892 --> 01:52:14,137
Sit down. Feel the top rung of the

1217
01:52:14,138 --> 01:52:16,646
ladder with your
right foot. Got it?

1218
01:52:16,814 --> 01:52:18,815
Down you go.

1219
01:52:33,997 --> 01:52:35,957
Danny cut out, huh?

1220
01:52:36,125 --> 01:52:38,835
Willie took him up
top. Hilts, I...

1221
01:52:52,015 --> 01:52:54,600
- Remember, keep your head down.
- Right.

1222
01:53:11,577 --> 01:53:13,619
Right.

1223
01:53:19,626 --> 01:53:21,627
Psst. Bartlett.

1224
01:54:00,626 --> 01:54:02,877
All right?

1225
01:54:03,045 --> 01:54:04,670
Hold on to yourself.
You're 20 feet short.

1226
01:54:04,838 --> 01:54:06,631
What do you mean?

1227
01:54:06,798 --> 01:54:09,550
Twenty feet short of the woods.
The hole is in the open.

1228
01:54:09,718 --> 01:54:12,220
The guard is between
us and the lights.

1229
01:54:12,387 --> 01:54:14,013
How could that happen?

1230
01:54:14,181 --> 01:54:16,057
What the hell difference
does it make? It's happened.

1231
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:32,720
Roger...

1232
01:54:32,721 --> 01:54:34,909
Damn it, Mac. I'm trying to think.

1233
01:54:35,786 --> 01:54:37,703
We could postpone it.

1234
01:54:37,871 --> 01:54:41,123
All the documents are dated
today. It's now or never.

1235
01:54:45,128 --> 01:54:48,589
One chance. When the guard
goes to the far end,

1236
01:54:48,757 --> 01:54:49,966
you might be able to move out.

1237
01:54:50,133 --> 01:54:52,163
I think I can make
it to the woods,

1238
01:54:52,164 --> 01:54:54,136
set up a signal when you're clear.

1239
01:54:54,304 --> 01:54:55,429
What about the towers?

1240
01:54:55,597 --> 01:54:58,975
They're gonna be watching the
compound, not the woods.

1241
01:55:03,313 --> 01:55:05,815
Mac, pass the word. Send
down 30 feet of rope.

1242
01:55:06,775 --> 01:55:08,359
Send down 30 feet of rope.

1243
01:55:10,237 --> 01:55:12,697
Send down 30 feet of rope.

1244
01:55:14,491 --> 01:55:16,325
Send down 30 feet of rope.

1245
01:55:16,493 --> 01:55:18,202
- What?
- Thirty feet of rope.

1246
01:55:18,370 --> 01:55:21,163
- What do they want that for?
- How should I know? Get the rope.

1247
01:55:37,014 --> 01:55:39,001
How's it going? Have you heard?

1248
01:55:39,002 --> 01:55:41,350
Some kind of foul-up,
I think, sir.

1249
01:55:41,518 --> 01:55:43,102
Haven't they moved
into the tunnel yet?

1250
01:55:43,270 --> 01:55:45,521
I don't think so, sir.

1251
01:56:07,878 --> 01:56:09,879
He's over there.

1252
01:56:15,969 --> 01:56:17,970
Right. You go first, Eric.

1253
01:56:19,181 --> 01:56:21,557
I'm staying here
till we get moving.

1254
01:56:32,778 --> 01:56:35,112
- See you in Piccadilly.
- Scott's Bar.

1255
01:56:35,405 --> 01:56:36,822
Right.

1256
01:56:49,628 --> 01:56:51,087
Thank you.

1257
01:56:51,254 --> 01:56:53,255
- Good luck.
- Right.

1258
01:57:18,115 --> 01:57:19,949
We're moving.

1259
01:57:26,623 --> 01:57:30,960
Danny, they're moving through the
tunnel now. They're getting out.

1260
01:57:33,338 --> 01:57:36,283
When Warsaw fell, you
escaped and came

1261
01:57:36,284 --> 01:57:38,926
to England because you're a flyer.

1262
01:57:39,094 --> 01:57:43,305
You came because you wanted to fly
with us and fight the Germans.

1263
01:57:43,473 --> 01:57:46,475
We can get out now. We
can get back to England.

1264
01:57:48,311 --> 01:57:50,438
If you don't go
through that tunnel,

1265
01:57:50,605 --> 01:57:54,734
everything you've done will
have been for nothing, nothing.

1266
01:58:23,096 --> 01:58:25,097
- Blythe's behind, Mac.
- Right.

1267
01:58:27,684 --> 01:58:29,685
- In here, Colin.
- Come on.

1268
01:58:30,187 --> 01:58:32,271
Sit down.

1269
01:58:36,902 --> 01:58:39,195
You're up, Sedgwick.
I'll take over.

1270
01:58:42,824 --> 01:58:44,701
What have you got
in here? A piano?

1271
01:58:44,702 --> 01:58:46,035
That's very funny, mate.

1272
01:58:46,203 --> 01:58:48,378
You won't get this thing through.

1273
01:58:48,379 --> 01:58:49,379
I'll cope.

1274
01:58:52,709 --> 01:58:54,886
Was that Sedgwick with his trunk?

1275
01:58:54,887 --> 01:58:55,887
Who else?

1276
01:58:56,087 --> 01:58:58,047
I wish he was home
with his kangaroos.

1277
01:59:05,013 --> 01:59:08,224
- We're 20 feet short.
- How the hell...?

1278
01:59:08,391 --> 01:59:10,893
Hilts is on the other end
of that rope in the woods.

1279
01:59:11,061 --> 01:59:13,505
As soon as you feel
a couple of tugs,

1280
01:59:13,506 --> 01:59:15,564
off you go, but keep Colin low.

1281
01:59:16,691 --> 01:59:18,567
- Good luck, Colin.
- Thanks, Mac.

1282
01:59:28,620 --> 01:59:29,620
What's that?

1283
01:59:31,581 --> 01:59:34,166
- It's an air raid.
- Oh, God. No.

1284
01:59:34,334 --> 01:59:35,712
The goons'll pull
the switches. We'll

1285
01:59:35,713 --> 01:59:36,836
lose the lights in the tunnel.

1286
01:59:38,088 --> 01:59:41,298
Come on, Colin. We can get
out when the lights go down.

1287
01:59:53,937 --> 01:59:55,563
Willie.

1288
01:59:56,064 --> 01:59:57,064
Willie.

1289
01:59:59,192 --> 02:00:02,236
It's an air raid. Searchlights
are out. Come on.

1290
02:00:08,535 --> 02:00:10,578
Get 'em out.

1291
02:00:15,876 --> 02:00:17,751
- It's gonna give.
- Danny.

1292
02:00:17,919 --> 02:00:21,505
Danny. Danny, it's all right.
Danny, it's the lights.

1293
02:00:23,300 --> 02:00:26,594
Light the lamps down there.

1294
02:00:27,137 --> 02:00:29,889
There's been an air raid and
they've cut the lights.

1295
02:00:30,056 --> 02:00:33,100
Danny, it's all
right. Listen to me.

1296
02:00:34,311 --> 02:00:36,312
Danny, look.

1297
02:00:39,649 --> 02:00:41,999
Come on, fellas.
Move. Move. We can

1298
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,153
get dozens out in this darkness.

1299
02:00:51,036 --> 02:00:53,162
What the hell's going on?

1300
02:00:53,330 --> 02:00:56,165
- You go.
- No. Danny.

1301
02:00:58,126 --> 02:01:00,127
Go.

1302
02:01:07,510 --> 02:01:09,511
- What is this, Willie?
- Danny.

1303
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:11,764
- Is he stuck in there?
- He's all right.

1304
02:01:11,932 --> 02:01:14,016
Get him out fast.

1305
02:01:16,102 --> 02:01:18,020
Psst. Come on.

1306
02:01:21,024 --> 02:01:22,816
Come on, Danny, move.

1307
02:01:39,042 --> 02:01:41,043
Up you go.

1308
02:01:47,050 --> 02:01:48,884
Give me your bag.

1309
02:01:55,725 --> 02:01:57,726
We're on the rope.

1310
02:02:42,814 --> 02:02:44,440
You and I had better get out,

1311
02:02:44,607 --> 02:02:46,442
or we won't have a chance
of any of the trains.

1312
02:02:46,609 --> 02:02:48,282
It's moving. We'll
just have to pass

1313
02:02:48,283 --> 02:02:49,820
the instructions from man to man.

1314
02:02:51,781 --> 02:02:53,574
- Right.
- I'll be right behind you.

1315
02:03:20,268 --> 02:03:22,144
Is there someone?

1316
02:03:28,485 --> 02:03:30,944
- Did you hear something?
- No.

1317
02:03:40,330 --> 02:03:42,539
Come on, come on.

1318
02:04:01,518 --> 02:04:02,518
Come on.

1319
02:04:21,037 --> 02:04:22,704
- Hey.
- Don't shoot.

1320
02:04:23,581 --> 02:04:28,043
Don't shoot.

1321
02:04:32,215 --> 02:04:34,383
Get off. We're coming back.

1322
02:04:57,574 --> 02:05:00,576
Oh, boy. There's a hell of a lot
of shooting going on up there.

1323
02:05:00,580 --> 02:05:02,046
Made me think they've
been shooting

1324
02:05:02,048 --> 02:05:03,675
them one by one as
they came up to you.

1325
02:05:03,705 --> 02:05:06,206
Right. We would've heard
the shots before.

1326
02:05:08,585 --> 02:05:10,919
- Pull.
- Wait for me.

1327
02:05:17,218 --> 02:05:19,218
Out.

1328
02:05:57,800 --> 02:05:59,927
The line-up, Captain.

1329
02:06:10,355 --> 02:06:13,982
- Seventy-six.
- Yes.

1330
02:06:15,735 --> 02:06:17,694
- How many did he say?
- Seventy-six.

1331
02:06:17,862 --> 02:06:19,321
Seventy-six.

1332
02:06:19,489 --> 02:06:20,989
- Seventy-six.
- Seventy-six.

1333
02:06:35,421 --> 02:06:37,422
- Dismissed.
- Ten hut.

1334
02:07:34,397 --> 02:07:37,566
Half the guys who missed their
trains are piled up here.

1335
02:07:37,734 --> 02:07:40,861
Ashley-Pitt, Roger,
MacDonald, Nimmo.

1336
02:07:41,029 --> 02:07:42,821
Makes quite a group.

1337
02:07:42,989 --> 02:07:46,575
- What do we do?
- Wait for the train.

1338
02:09:34,642 --> 02:09:36,101
Thank you.

1339
02:11:51,445 --> 02:11:53,154
Can you take me with you?

1340
02:11:53,322 --> 02:11:55,115
Get in.

1341
02:11:55,283 --> 02:11:56,575
Thank you very much.

1342
02:13:44,100 --> 02:13:46,267
Your ID, please.

1343
02:13:51,399 --> 02:13:53,400
Tally ho.

1344
02:14:16,924 --> 02:14:19,968
- Are you French?
- Yes.

1345
02:14:20,136 --> 02:14:22,137
Me, too.

1346
02:14:27,309 --> 02:14:29,978
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

1347
02:14:36,318 --> 02:14:38,319
Tally ho.

1348
02:14:47,329 --> 02:14:49,831
Are you travelling for a company?

1349
02:14:49,832 --> 02:14:50,832
Yes.

1350
02:14:50,833 --> 02:14:52,834
For my

1351
02:14:53,669 --> 02:14:55,670
For my business.

1352
02:14:57,757 --> 02:14:59,799
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

1353
02:15:11,145 --> 02:15:12,778
Are the police on the train?

1354
02:15:12,779 --> 02:15:15,064
The Gestapo are with
them. Let's jump.

1355
02:15:15,232 --> 02:15:17,233
All right.

1356
02:15:21,697 --> 02:15:22,989
I'll tell you when.

1357
02:15:23,157 --> 02:15:26,034
I'd prefer you just to
give me a firm push.

1358
02:15:45,513 --> 02:15:48,473
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

1359
02:15:48,641 --> 02:15:50,975
That's quite exciting.

1360
02:15:52,353 --> 02:15:55,355
- It isn't stopping.
- No, we're all right.

1361
02:16:51,370 --> 02:16:53,371
Switzerland.

1362
02:17:26,322 --> 02:17:27,488
Hey.

1363
02:17:27,656 --> 02:17:29,991
Where do you want
to go? Come here.

1364
02:17:38,208 --> 02:17:41,294
Where do you want to
go? Show your ID.

1365
02:21:35,779 --> 02:21:36,779
Bartlett.

1366
02:21:53,630 --> 02:21:55,381
Everything on the ground.

1367
02:22:36,298 --> 02:22:40,968
- Where were you going, Cavendish?
- I hadn't quite decided.

1368
02:22:41,136 --> 02:22:43,763
What information were you
to collect on the way?

1369
02:22:43,931 --> 02:22:44,931
None.

1370
02:22:45,057 --> 02:22:47,642
What sabotage directions
did you receive?

1371
02:22:47,809 --> 02:22:50,144
What have you done
with your papers?

1372
02:22:51,814 --> 02:22:52,814
Papers?

1373
02:22:52,815 --> 02:22:55,316
Forged papers and identity cards.

1374
02:22:55,484 --> 02:22:58,653
Don't be so stupid. What
did you do with them?

1375
02:22:58,820 --> 02:23:00,821
All I did was escape
from a prison camp.

1376
02:23:00,989 --> 02:23:03,616
You'd do the same if you'd been
locked up for three years.

1377
02:23:05,077 --> 02:23:06,077
I wanted to get home.

1378
02:23:06,203 --> 02:23:08,579
I don't think you'll
see your wife again.

1379
02:23:08,747 --> 02:23:11,624
You've got the wrong man.
I'm not even married.

1380
02:23:11,792 --> 02:23:14,001
You're wearing civilian clothes.

1381
02:23:15,337 --> 02:23:18,839
You're a spy. Spies
are being shot.

1382
02:23:19,007 --> 02:23:22,843
This is my uniform. I had to
re-cut it when I lost weight.

1383
02:23:24,513 --> 02:23:27,181
I dyed it with boot polish
to cover some oil smears

1384
02:23:27,349 --> 02:23:29,684
I picked up when I was shot down.

1385
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:43,197
And you lost your
insignia over the years?

1386
02:23:43,365 --> 02:23:45,199
That's right.

1387
02:23:45,367 --> 02:23:47,702
Bring him to the others.

1388
02:23:50,455 --> 02:23:52,790
- Look...
- That's all, Cavendish.

1389
02:24:17,441 --> 02:24:19,442
Hello, boys.

1390
02:24:23,238 --> 02:24:25,239
Hello.

1391
02:24:27,451 --> 02:24:29,910
- Hello, Haynes.
- Hello, Cavendish.

1392
02:24:31,371 --> 02:24:33,914
I wish I could say I was
happy to see you again.

1393
02:24:34,082 --> 02:24:36,709
- Just picked up?
- Yes, this morning.

1394
02:24:54,561 --> 02:24:56,937
There's a trainer out
there I can fly.

1395
02:24:57,105 --> 02:24:59,732
- Any sentries?
- Yeah, it's gonna be a problem.

1396
02:26:07,676 --> 02:26:12,471
Colin, when I say go,
crank this clockwise.

1397
02:26:12,973 --> 02:26:14,640
When the engine
catches, don't move,

1398
02:26:14,808 --> 02:26:17,852
or you'll get a mouth
full of propeller.

1399
02:26:31,199 --> 02:26:32,199
Go.

1400
02:27:22,626 --> 02:27:24,710
Next stop, Switzerland.

1401
02:28:47,002 --> 02:28:50,504
- The Alps.
- Splendid.

1402
02:29:02,434 --> 02:29:06,812
Over this range, then 20 more
minutes and we've got it made.

1403
02:29:33,673 --> 02:29:35,017
What is it? Petrol?

1404
02:29:35,018 --> 02:29:37,384
I don't know. We're losing power.

1405
02:30:03,036 --> 02:30:05,621
Go that way. I'll follow.

1406
02:30:30,105 --> 02:30:31,230
Hendley?

1407
02:30:36,111 --> 02:30:38,112
Colin.

1408
02:30:41,908 --> 02:30:44,284
Stop. Don't shoot. Please.

1409
02:30:48,331 --> 02:30:52,626
Colin... I'm sorry I
fouled things up.

1410
02:30:53,962 --> 02:30:55,963
That's all right.

1411
02:30:56,965 --> 02:30:58,966
Thank you for...

1412
02:30:59,801 --> 02:31:02,761
getting me... out.

1413
02:32:43,822 --> 02:32:44,863
Come on, get up.

1414
02:32:53,957 --> 02:32:54,957
Hands up.

1415
02:33:39,961 --> 02:33:42,462
Hello, gentlemen. How is it
going? Things are going well?

1416
02:33:42,630 --> 02:33:43,630
Hello.

1417
02:33:43,756 --> 02:33:46,800
As usual, three Pernod, is not it?

1418
02:33:48,261 --> 02:33:50,262
Three Pernod, Dad.

1419
02:34:05,153 --> 02:34:07,112
Café Suzette.

1420
02:34:08,281 --> 02:34:10,324
Yes.

1421
02:34:13,828 --> 02:34:16,580
And here, gentlemen,
the three Pernods.

1422
02:34:16,581 --> 02:34:17,581
Thank you.

1423
02:34:17,665 --> 02:34:18,999
Two...

1424
02:34:19,167 --> 02:34:21,418
And three. And that's water.

1425
02:34:21,586 --> 02:34:24,004
- Good appetite, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

1426
02:34:26,758 --> 02:34:30,052
Sir. Phone for you.

1427
02:34:31,137 --> 02:34:33,972
- Phone for me?
- Yes, sir, phone.

1428
02:34:34,140 --> 02:34:35,182
This way.

1429
02:34:35,350 --> 02:34:37,351
That's it, phone.

1430
02:34:37,852 --> 02:34:39,937
Thank you.

1431
02:34:40,521 --> 02:34:45,192
Hello?

1432
02:35:22,230 --> 02:35:23,730
Resistance.

1433
02:35:23,898 --> 02:35:25,899
Resistance?

1434
02:35:26,317 --> 02:35:28,360
You are English?

1435
02:35:29,028 --> 02:35:30,604
I'm Australian.

1436
02:35:30,605 --> 02:35:31,605
Tell me

1437
02:35:31,606 --> 02:35:33,573
You can speak English.
I understand.

1438
02:35:33,741 --> 02:35:36,410
Bloody good. I'm a
British officer.

1439
02:35:36,577 --> 02:35:39,871
I've just escaped from a
prisoner-of-war camp in Germany.

1440
02:35:40,039 --> 02:35:43,583
I'm trying to make my way into
Spain. You understand me?

1441
02:35:43,751 --> 02:35:45,585
- Yes.
- Can you help me?

1442
02:35:45,753 --> 02:35:48,547
Huh?

1443
02:35:49,757 --> 02:35:52,217
- I know someone who can.
- Bloody good.

1444
02:36:08,609 --> 02:36:11,611
Secret State Police.
Your ID, please.

1445
02:36:15,116 --> 02:36:17,284
- Ah, French?
- Yes.

1446
02:36:17,452 --> 02:36:20,620
- Trader?
- But yes. Do you speak French?

1447
02:36:20,788 --> 02:36:23,457
- A little.
- Your accent is very good.

1448
02:36:23,624 --> 02:36:27,127
I studied it in the upper school.

1449
02:36:30,631 --> 02:36:32,799
Very good. Pass.

1450
02:36:32,967 --> 02:36:35,385
Goodbye, sir. Goodbye.

1451
02:36:36,763 --> 02:36:38,972
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

1452
02:36:43,394 --> 02:36:44,644
Halt.

1453
02:36:52,820 --> 02:36:56,156
Two are AWOL from the
camp. Englishman.

1454
02:37:05,833 --> 02:37:07,125
Come on.

1455
02:37:08,169 --> 02:37:09,628
Get in everything.

1456
02:37:10,129 --> 02:37:11,421
Enter.

1457
02:37:44,872 --> 02:37:46,873
Stop. Stop.

1458
02:38:26,914 --> 02:38:29,291
Stay standing. Hands up.

1459
02:38:31,419 --> 02:38:34,379
- What was that?
- You are English.

1460
02:38:34,547 --> 02:38:35,714
English people?

1461
02:38:35,882 --> 02:38:37,841
You threaten me with a pistol?

1462
02:38:38,009 --> 02:38:40,969
- Take them away.
- Oh, you are German?

1463
02:38:41,137 --> 02:38:44,389
- Of course.
- All right. Excuse me.

1464
02:39:15,755 --> 02:39:17,756
Herr Bartlett?

1465
02:39:23,596 --> 02:39:27,224
- My name is Frohe.
- Your German is good.

1466
02:39:27,808 --> 02:39:30,101
And I hear also your French.

1467
02:39:31,979 --> 02:39:34,940
Your arms... up.

1468
02:39:48,788 --> 02:39:50,789
Excellent.

1469
02:40:03,678 --> 02:40:05,345
Ah.

1470
02:40:11,185 --> 02:40:13,186
Herr Bartlett...

1471
02:40:13,813 --> 02:40:16,147
and Herr MacDonald.

1472
02:40:19,026 --> 02:40:21,069
We are together again.

1473
02:40:21,654 --> 02:40:25,699
You are going to wish you had
never put us to so much trouble.

1474
02:40:41,716 --> 02:40:45,218
- What's troubling you, Roger?
- I'm just a little surprised.

1475
02:40:45,386 --> 02:40:48,888
I expected either a long
stay or a very short trip.

1476
02:40:49,056 --> 02:40:51,016
Yes.

1477
02:40:51,183 --> 02:40:53,518
I have to admit, I'm a
little worried, though.

1478
02:40:53,686 --> 02:40:56,229
I hope to God I haven't
blotted 70-odd ledgers.

1479
02:40:56,397 --> 02:40:58,565
Och, no, no.

1480
02:40:58,733 --> 02:41:02,402
We're all over 21,
footloose and fancy-free.

1481
02:41:02,570 --> 02:41:05,405
We'd never have got as far as
we did without you, Roger.

1482
02:41:05,614 --> 02:41:09,409
For what it's worth, I think
you did a damn good job.

1483
02:41:09,577 --> 02:41:12,370
- I think we all do.
- Yes.

1484
02:41:50,618 --> 02:41:51,910
What's going on? Where are we?

1485
02:41:52,078 --> 02:41:53,770
All right. You can get out now.

1486
02:41:53,771 --> 02:41:55,789
Stretch your legs
for five minutes.

1487
02:41:55,956 --> 02:41:59,417
It will take hours before
you reach the camp.

1488
02:42:20,356 --> 02:42:24,651
You know, Mac, all this, the
organisation, tunnelling,

1489
02:42:24,819 --> 02:42:28,988
Tom and Harry, kept me alive.

1490
02:42:29,156 --> 02:42:31,157
And even though we...

1491
02:42:32,493 --> 02:42:34,786
I've never been happier.

1492
02:42:35,663 --> 02:42:37,956
You know, Mac...

1493
02:43:18,038 --> 02:43:21,166
Eleven of your men are
being returned today.

1494
02:43:21,333 --> 02:43:25,003
- Oh, who?
- I do not have that information.

1495
02:43:25,421 --> 02:43:27,547
I...

1496
02:43:28,007 --> 02:43:32,719
I am directed by a higher
authority to inform you that...

1497
02:43:33,846 --> 02:43:37,223
50 of your officers were
shot while escaping.

1498
02:43:38,726 --> 02:43:39,893
Shot?

1499
02:43:41,228 --> 02:43:44,898
Their... personal effects
will be returned.

1500
02:43:48,068 --> 02:43:49,569
How many of them were wounded?

1501
02:43:51,739 --> 02:43:55,116
Here are the names... of the dead.

1502
02:43:58,746 --> 02:44:00,455
How many of the 50 were wounded?

1503
02:44:02,374 --> 02:44:07,337
None. They, the
higher authority...

1504
02:44:08,339 --> 02:44:10,882
only directs me to
inform you that...

1505
02:44:13,802 --> 02:44:15,845
that 50 men were...

1506
02:44:21,852 --> 02:44:22,977
I see.

1507
02:44:25,105 --> 02:44:27,148
Addison, John.

1508
02:44:27,316 --> 02:44:29,150
Alladale, Peter.

1509
02:44:29,318 --> 02:44:31,319
Bancroft, Edward.

1510
02:44:31,487 --> 02:44:33,571
Bartlett, Roger.

1511
02:44:33,739 --> 02:44:35,698
Cavendish, Dennis.

1512
02:44:35,908 --> 02:44:37,951
Eldridge, David.

1513
02:44:38,702 --> 02:44:40,703
Felton, William.

1514
02:44:41,664 --> 02:44:43,665
Fanshaw, Arthur.

1515
02:45:43,142 --> 02:45:45,476
- Right here?
- Yes sir. It's here.

1516
02:45:45,644 --> 02:45:47,312
Goodbye then.

1517
02:45:47,479 --> 02:45:50,481
- Thank you very much sir.
- You're welcome. Goodbye.

1518
02:45:50,649 --> 02:45:53,401
- Goodbye.
- Good luck.

1519
02:46:07,708 --> 02:46:09,667
I am your guide, señor.

1520
02:46:09,835 --> 02:46:12,003
For Spain?

1521
02:46:12,171 --> 02:46:14,005
España.

1522
02:46:33,484 --> 02:46:36,069
- Glad to see you're all safe.
- Thank you, sir.

1523
02:46:36,236 --> 02:46:38,613
- How many have been brought back?
- You're the first.

1524
02:46:38,781 --> 02:46:40,615
- Do you know how many got away?
- Not yet.

1525
02:46:42,076 --> 02:46:43,326
What happened to Blythe?

1526
02:46:44,912 --> 02:46:47,121
He didn't make it, sir.

1527
02:46:47,289 --> 02:46:49,582
Roger was right about that.

1528
02:46:50,376 --> 02:46:52,710
I'm afraid Roger didn't
make it, either.

1529
02:46:55,631 --> 02:46:59,676
I've just posted the
list. They shot... 50.

1530
02:47:00,302 --> 02:47:02,303
The Gestapo murdered them.

1531
02:47:03,555 --> 02:47:07,100
Fifty? MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt?

1532
02:47:07,601 --> 02:47:10,144
- Yes.
- Danny and Willie?

1533
02:47:10,312 --> 02:47:12,146
No, they're not on the list.

1534
02:47:12,815 --> 02:47:18,111
- Haynes?
- Yes. I'm sorry.

1535
02:47:20,155 --> 02:47:21,921
Roger's idea was
to get back at the

1536
02:47:21,922 --> 02:47:23,491
enemy the hardest way he could.

1537
02:47:23,659 --> 02:47:26,077
Mess up the works.

1538
02:47:26,245 --> 02:47:29,372
From what we've heard here, I
think he did exactly that.

1539
02:47:29,832 --> 02:47:31,999
Do you think it was
worth the price?

1540
02:47:33,085 --> 02:47:35,670
That depends on your
point of view, Hendley.

1541
02:47:38,799 --> 02:47:40,174
Yes, sir.

1542
02:48:29,047 --> 02:48:30,047
Attention.

1543
02:48:30,142 --> 02:48:34,187
He is not to be saluted.
He's no longer in command.

1544
02:48:41,779 --> 02:48:44,238
The job just didn't work out, huh?

1545
02:48:44,406 --> 02:48:47,867
- You were lucky, Hilts.
- Lucky? Because I didn't...

1546
02:48:50,162 --> 02:48:51,162
How many?

1547
02:48:51,872 --> 02:48:52,872
Fifty.

1548
02:48:55,209 --> 02:49:00,505
It looks, after all, as if you
will see Berlin before I do.

1549
02:49:52,933 --> 02:49:54,976
Sir.

1550
02:50:01,733 --> 02:50:03,109
Hey, Hilts.
