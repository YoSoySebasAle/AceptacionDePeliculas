1
00:01:24,004 --> 00:01:25,004
How's that going?

2
00:01:25,274 --> 00:01:27,094
Mother's bawling and the
uncle is pissed off.

3
00:01:27,764 --> 00:01:28,764
She's not married?

4
00:01:29,024 --> 00:01:30,854
Divorced, with 4 kids.

5
00:01:30,964 --> 00:01:33,204
I guess the Father
was helping out.

6
00:01:33,574 --> 00:01:34,784
Helping out?

7
00:01:37,874 --> 00:01:39,774
Hey, Mr Burke, they're in the
back talking to the Bishop.

8
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:41,234
And Father?

9
00:01:41,274 --> 00:01:42,364
We put him in the break room.

10
00:01:42,744 --> 00:01:43,924
Any press?

11
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,464
Some guy from the Citizen,
but we sent him away.

12
00:01:46,724 --> 00:01:47,724
None of the big papers.

13
00:01:48,054 --> 00:01:49,224
Let's keep it that way.

14
00:01:50,264 --> 00:01:51,264
Who's that?

15
00:01:51,684 --> 00:01:52,804
Assistant D.A.

16
00:01:54,024 --> 00:01:55,824
It's gonna be hard to keep
the papers from arraignment.

17
00:01:56,304 --> 00:01:57,444
What arraignment?

18
00:02:00,324 --> 00:02:02,664
You can tell Father Geoghan
it won't be much longer.

19
00:02:03,994 --> 00:02:07,224
Now Sheila, you know
what a good work...

20
00:02:07,254 --> 00:02:09,504
the Church does in
the community...

21
00:02:09,974 --> 00:02:12,593
But I give you my
personal guarantee...

22
00:02:12,594 --> 00:02:14,684
that I'm going to take
Father out of the parish...

23
00:02:14,714 --> 00:02:17,114
and this will never happen again.

24
00:02:18,694 --> 00:02:20,874
We'll just be another moment Paul.

25
00:02:21,484 --> 00:02:22,484
Of course Father.

26
00:02:23,544 --> 00:02:26,644
Now Sheila, I'm going to
give you my personal card.

27
00:03:04,214 --> 00:03:06,114
Losing a good reporter...

28
00:03:06,514 --> 00:03:07,554
is always tough.

29
00:03:08,474 --> 00:03:10,534
But losing one of our best...

30
00:03:10,994 --> 00:03:13,674
Well, to put it this
eloquently as I can.

31
00:03:13,724 --> 00:03:14,994
It's a real kick in the ass.

32
00:03:15,994 --> 00:03:18,064
But, Robby here has
known Stewart...

33
00:03:18,204 --> 00:03:20,614
longer than most
of you been alive.

34
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,114
So I'll handed off to him. Robby.

35
00:03:22,624 --> 00:03:25,324
Oh, well, thanks Ben. I think.

36
00:03:26,254 --> 00:03:27,584
Although I take issue...

37
00:03:27,904 --> 00:03:30,744
with your reference
to my seniority.

38
00:03:30,914 --> 00:03:33,894
I will say that Stewart's
departure is specially...

39
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:36,174
painful for me, because...

40
00:03:36,284 --> 00:03:37,284
For what?

41
00:03:37,374 --> 00:03:38,814
Stewart, 20 years now?

42
00:03:39,234 --> 00:03:40,614
Stewart's been more
than willing...

43
00:03:40,744 --> 00:03:42,994
to part with his money
at a poker table.

44
00:03:44,114 --> 00:03:46,264
And, I've got a kid in college.

45
00:03:47,334 --> 00:03:48,454
Yeah, but I'm gonna keep playing.

46
00:03:48,584 --> 00:03:49,974
Oh, problem solved.

47
00:03:50,854 --> 00:03:51,854
God speed then.

48
00:03:53,564 --> 00:03:55,484
Now Stewart, I find the...

49
00:03:56,184 --> 00:03:57,914
timing of your departure...

50
00:03:58,694 --> 00:03:59,694
disconcerted.

51
00:04:00,554 --> 00:04:01,734
A corner office...

52
00:04:01,964 --> 00:04:02,964
sits empty.

53
00:04:03,624 --> 00:04:05,414
The new editor arrives on Monday.

54
00:04:06,254 --> 00:04:07,594
So I'm sorry buddy, but...

55
00:04:07,754 --> 00:04:08,954
I got to ask you.

56
00:04:09,644 --> 00:04:11,004
What the hell do you know?

57
00:04:28,614 --> 00:04:29,834
How's the cake?

58
00:04:30,074 --> 00:04:31,074
It's really good.

59
00:04:31,294 --> 00:04:32,294
You saving yours?

60
00:04:32,443 --> 00:04:33,443
No, that's for Mike.

61
00:04:33,444 --> 00:04:35,411
I can't ever eat at those things,
they are kinda depressing.

62
00:04:35,504 --> 00:04:36,504
I know.

63
00:04:37,264 --> 00:04:38,564
Did you see the numbers
from Washington?

64
00:04:38,565 --> 00:04:39,765
Yeah, very interesting.

65
00:04:41,134 --> 00:04:43,114
I'm not asking if the PD is
lying, I know they're lying.

66
00:04:43,314 --> 00:04:44,974
All I'm asking who's behind it?

67
00:04:47,094 --> 00:04:49,244
Ok, I get it, you
don't wanna talk.

68
00:04:49,994 --> 00:04:51,494
No Dan, I'm not mad, I'm hungry.

69
00:04:51,604 --> 00:04:53,364
I've been talking to you so
long I didn't eat lunch.

70
00:04:53,464 --> 00:04:54,804
So I'm gonna get
something to eat...

71
00:04:54,824 --> 00:04:56,058
and I'll give you an
hour to decide...

72
00:04:56,059 --> 00:04:57,734
whether you want to be on
the right side of this...

73
00:04:57,754 --> 00:04:59,154
or read about it
like everybody else.

74
00:04:59,334 --> 00:05:00,334
Bye Dan.

75
00:05:00,844 --> 00:05:02,114
You think Cahill has something?

76
00:05:02,154 --> 00:05:04,454
Maybe. I just don't think
the story is for us.

77
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:05,533
Ben likes it?

78
00:05:05,534 --> 00:05:07,594
Yeah, it's not bad. It's
just not Spotlight.

79
00:05:07,754 --> 00:05:08,944
What's just not Spotlight?

80
00:05:09,264 --> 00:05:11,384
- PD numbers.
- The numbers story, feels thin.

81
00:05:12,324 --> 00:05:14,264
Oh, you got Cahill to talk?

82
00:05:15,324 --> 00:05:16,664
No, but I will.

83
00:05:17,494 --> 00:05:19,624
Good, then know if it's thin.

84
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:22,944
How did it go upstairs?

85
00:05:22,964 --> 00:05:24,944
Ok, Robby gave a good speech.

86
00:05:25,023 --> 00:05:26,023
Sure he did.

87
00:05:26,024 --> 00:05:27,591
I heard Lubin and Connor
are going to the Times.

88
00:05:27,844 --> 00:05:29,078
- C'mon, really?
- Yeah, I heard that.

89
00:05:29,114 --> 00:05:30,174
They are leaching us.

90
00:05:30,214 --> 00:05:32,924
Well, at least they are sending us
a guy from Miami to run things.

91
00:05:32,974 --> 00:05:34,043
That should help.

92
00:05:34,044 --> 00:05:35,834
Has Baron even spent
time in Boston?

93
00:05:35,974 --> 00:05:37,114
He's never been here before.

94
00:05:37,274 --> 00:05:38,414
Maybe we should buy him a map.

95
00:05:38,844 --> 00:05:39,934
I have a friend down in Miami,

96
00:05:39,974 --> 00:05:41,234
said he cut 15% of the stuff.

97
00:05:41,404 --> 00:05:42,924
- Great.
- Hey Robby?

98
00:05:42,954 --> 00:05:44,154
New boss coming in
to make some cuts?

99
00:05:44,524 --> 00:05:46,204
I have no idea.

100
00:05:46,824 --> 00:05:48,384
Aren't you sitting down with him?

101
00:05:48,393 --> 00:05:49,393
Yes I am.

102
00:05:49,394 --> 00:05:50,524
So is it about Spotlight?

103
00:05:50,853 --> 00:05:51,853
I don't know Mike.

104
00:05:51,854 --> 00:05:52,894
But I do know...

105
00:05:52,954 --> 00:05:55,894
That Ben needs an answer on
that crime number story.

106
00:05:56,534 --> 00:05:59,094
I'm telling you, I really don't
think that story is for us.

107
00:06:04,704 --> 00:06:05,704
Mr Baron.

108
00:06:06,744 --> 00:06:07,944
Walter Robinson.

109
00:06:07,994 --> 00:06:08,994
Robby.

110
00:06:09,434 --> 00:06:10,954
Thanks for taking
a time of your...

111
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,404
- Oh, it's my pleasure.
- Appreciate it.

112
00:06:17,674 --> 00:06:18,724
Oh, yeah.

113
00:06:19,054 --> 00:06:20,244
Great book.

114
00:06:20,384 --> 00:06:22,534
Globe has a season
tickets at Fenway...

115
00:06:22,584 --> 00:06:23,984
once you settle in, by the way.

116
00:06:24,324 --> 00:06:25,564
Thank you.

117
00:06:25,724 --> 00:06:28,564
To be honest, I'm not
much of baseball fan...

118
00:06:28,594 --> 00:06:31,054
I'm just trying to get
the feel for the city.

119
00:06:31,664 --> 00:06:33,174
Oh, yeah.

120
00:06:33,634 --> 00:06:35,134
So, you're originally from Boston?

121
00:06:35,344 --> 00:06:37,124
I am, born and raised, yeah.

122
00:06:37,344 --> 00:06:39,624
A lot of the newsroom
is from here.

123
00:06:39,654 --> 00:06:41,174
Really feels like ah...

124
00:06:41,254 --> 00:06:43,174
like a local paper in that way.

125
00:06:43,473 --> 00:06:44,473
And did that changed at all

126
00:06:44,474 --> 00:06:46,414
after the paper were
sold to the Times?

127
00:06:48,054 --> 00:06:50,774
No. I don't think that big impact.

128
00:06:51,254 --> 00:06:52,374
Good.

129
00:06:54,284 --> 00:06:57,944
And... You're an editor
for the Spotlight team.

130
00:06:57,974 --> 00:06:59,574
I prefer to think of myself...

131
00:06:59,594 --> 00:07:01,194
as a player-coach, but yes.

132
00:07:01,624 --> 00:07:03,194
Are you familiar
with the Spotlight?

133
00:07:04,034 --> 00:07:05,174
No, not particularly.

134
00:07:05,214 --> 00:07:08,714
Well, we are a 4 person
investigative team.

135
00:07:09,004 --> 00:07:11,744
We report to Ben
Bradlee Jr. And...

136
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,904
we keep our work confidential.

137
00:07:15,614 --> 00:07:17,044
What are you working on now?

138
00:07:17,614 --> 00:07:19,044
We just put out a
piece on a shoddy...

139
00:07:19,154 --> 00:07:21,104
contraction outfit
and right now...

140
00:07:21,154 --> 00:07:24,444
we're really just trolling
around for our next story.

141
00:07:25,024 --> 00:07:27,084
How long does that typically take?

142
00:07:27,224 --> 00:07:29,584
Hard to say, a couple months.

143
00:07:30,724 --> 00:07:31,754
Couple months?

144
00:07:31,824 --> 00:07:33,754
Yeah, we don't like to rush it.

145
00:07:34,094 --> 00:07:36,044
Once we settle on the project...

146
00:07:36,114 --> 00:07:39,224
we can spend a year or
more investigating.

147
00:07:42,204 --> 00:07:44,794
- Is that a concern?
- Not necessarily.

148
00:07:45,404 --> 00:07:47,874
But, but from what I
understand readership is down,

149
00:07:47,904 --> 00:07:50,244
the Internet is cutting into
the Classified business.

150
00:07:50,264 --> 00:07:54,494
And, I think I'm gonna need to
take a hard look at things.

151
00:07:55,454 --> 00:07:59,064
So... You anticipate more cuts?

152
00:08:00,684 --> 00:08:03,404
I think it's safe to
assume so, but...

153
00:08:04,194 --> 00:08:06,064
what I'm more focused
on right now is...

154
00:08:06,144 --> 00:08:08,594
finding the way to
make this paper...

155
00:08:09,434 --> 00:08:11,114
essential to its readers.

156
00:08:12,304 --> 00:08:13,904
I like to think it already is.

157
00:08:15,474 --> 00:08:19,194
Fair enough. I just think
that we can do better.

158
00:08:31,524 --> 00:08:32,874
- Mr Bradlee.
- Hey.

159
00:08:33,154 --> 00:08:34,960
Saw the PD numbers,
looks interesting?

160
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:36,414
Yeah, there's something there.

161
00:08:36,624 --> 00:08:38,844
- How long do you need?
- Another week.

162
00:08:39,824 --> 00:08:42,074
- Where are you going?
- 10:30.

163
00:08:42,394 --> 00:08:43,444
Since when?

164
00:08:43,764 --> 00:08:46,914
- Technically I am an editor.
- Technically.

165
00:08:47,604 --> 00:08:49,524
Your sit down with
Baron go that well?

166
00:08:49,604 --> 00:08:51,524
I couldn't get a read on him.

167
00:08:51,644 --> 00:08:52,814
That's a first.

168
00:08:52,864 --> 00:08:53,914
How about you?

169
00:08:53,944 --> 00:08:55,884
Oh, he's a barrel of laughs.

170
00:08:57,414 --> 00:08:59,214
Morning everyone.
Lets get started.

171
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,714
Do you want to say
something, Marty?

172
00:09:02,754 --> 00:09:03,814
Sure.

173
00:09:05,954 --> 00:09:06,954
Hello.

174
00:09:07,684 --> 00:09:09,974
As most of you know by now...

175
00:09:10,124 --> 00:09:11,574
my name is Marty Baron.

176
00:09:12,164 --> 00:09:14,994
I'm... delighted to be here.

177
00:09:17,464 --> 00:09:19,563
If you could tell me your
name as we go around...

178
00:09:19,564 --> 00:09:21,564
that'd be helpful. Thank you.

179
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,964
- Ok, Peter.
- Peter Canellos, Metro.

180
00:09:28,074 --> 00:09:30,394
We've got a major
Big Dig closure...

181
00:09:32,144 --> 00:09:34,014
- Hey, Steve.
- Mike.

182
00:09:34,114 --> 00:09:35,174
Hey.

183
00:09:35,554 --> 00:09:37,194
Crappy game last night.

184
00:09:37,554 --> 00:09:39,194
They can't hit worth a nickel.

185
00:09:39,224 --> 00:09:43,064
Listen, what's, what's Eileen
McNamara doing in 10:30?

186
00:09:43,794 --> 00:09:45,024
You need something, Mike?

187
00:09:45,163 --> 00:09:46,163
No. Just curious?

188
00:09:46,164 --> 00:09:48,564
Go be curious somewhere
else. I got work to do.

189
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:51,034
- Ok Steve, see you.
- Yeah.

190
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:54,044
And it looks like Pedro is going
to be out till September 1st.

191
00:09:54,504 --> 00:09:55,844
Jimmy says he could
be back this year,

192
00:09:55,884 --> 00:09:57,524
but the doctor
didn't seem so sure.

193
00:09:57,804 --> 00:09:59,304
When's the Pats opener?

194
00:10:03,044 --> 00:10:05,944
- Is that everyone?
- Yes, that's it.

195
00:10:06,444 --> 00:10:08,424
Ok, good, thank you.

196
00:10:09,554 --> 00:10:13,124
Did everyone read Eileen
McNamara column this weekend?

197
00:10:14,354 --> 00:10:17,664
- That's the Geoghan case?
- Yeah. What's the folo on that?

198
00:10:18,424 --> 00:10:21,794
It's a column, what kind of
follow would you thinking?

199
00:10:22,494 --> 00:10:25,644
Well, apparently this
priest molested kids...

200
00:10:25,664 --> 00:10:27,904
in 6 different parishes
over the last 30 years.

201
00:10:27,924 --> 00:10:29,191
And the attorney for
the victims, Mr

202
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:31,084
Garabedian.

203
00:10:31,124 --> 00:10:34,254
Thanks Eileen. Mr Garabedian
says Cardinal Law...

204
00:10:34,284 --> 00:10:36,344
found about it 15 years
ago and did nothing.

205
00:10:36,374 --> 00:10:38,114
Yeah, I think that attorney
is a bit of crank...

206
00:10:38,144 --> 00:10:39,604
and the Church
dismissed the claim.

207
00:10:39,634 --> 00:10:40,954
He said, she said.

208
00:10:40,994 --> 00:10:43,314
Whether Mr Garabedian
is a crank or not...

209
00:10:43,334 --> 00:10:45,614
he says he has documents to
prove that Cardinal knew.

210
00:10:45,784 --> 00:10:48,004
And as I understand that those
documents are under a seal.

211
00:10:48,044 --> 00:10:50,674
Ok, but the fact remains
that Boston priest...

212
00:10:50,704 --> 00:10:52,934
abused 80 kids. We
have a lawyer...

213
00:10:52,964 --> 00:10:54,954
who says he can prove
Law knew about it...

214
00:10:54,984 --> 00:10:56,294
and we written all of...

215
00:10:56,314 --> 00:10:58,294
2 stories in the last 6 months.

216
00:10:59,204 --> 00:11:01,504
This strikes me as an
essential story...

217
00:11:01,524 --> 00:11:03,864
to a local paper, I think
that at very least...

218
00:11:03,874 --> 00:11:06,044
we have to go through
those documents.

219
00:11:06,574 --> 00:11:08,014
How would you like to do that?

220
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:11,734
Well, I don't know what
the laws are here,

221
00:11:11,744 --> 00:11:13,934
but in Florida, we
would go to Court.

222
00:11:14,514 --> 00:11:16,144
You want to sue the Church?

223
00:11:16,944 --> 00:11:18,704
Technically we wouldn't
sue the Church...

224
00:11:18,724 --> 00:11:21,504
we'd file a motion to lift
the seal on those documents.

225
00:11:21,624 --> 00:11:23,564
The Church would read
that as us suing them.

226
00:11:24,224 --> 00:11:25,364
So will everybody else.

227
00:11:26,864 --> 00:11:27,884
Good to know.

228
00:11:31,294 --> 00:11:32,954
Gutsy call for a first day.

229
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:33,994
That's one word for it.

230
00:11:34,124 --> 00:11:35,934
How do you think that's
gonna play down front?

231
00:11:35,954 --> 00:11:37,804
I think Gilman's
gonna shit a brick.

232
00:11:38,074 --> 00:11:39,494
- Hey.
- Door.

233
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,074
How did it go?

234
00:11:41,544 --> 00:11:43,444
Well, Baron wants to sue for...

235
00:11:43,474 --> 00:11:45,344
the sealed docs in
the Geoghan case.

236
00:11:45,584 --> 00:11:48,194
Wants to sue the Church?
Hey, that's great.

237
00:11:48,814 --> 00:11:51,754
We covered Geoghan when the
story broke 3 years ago.

238
00:11:51,784 --> 00:11:53,104
Baron was still in Miami.

239
00:11:53,124 --> 00:11:55,263
I think he was at the
Times then actually.

240
00:11:55,264 --> 00:11:56,264
He wasn't here.

241
00:11:56,294 --> 00:11:58,304
So do you think that
sue has a chance?

242
00:11:59,264 --> 00:12:02,884
- Depend on the Judge.
- And what parish he belongs to.

243
00:12:04,494 --> 00:12:08,584
Bradlee. Yeah. Ok.

244
00:12:10,504 --> 00:12:11,924
Baron wants to talk to us.

245
00:12:12,644 --> 00:12:13,644
Us?

246
00:12:14,244 --> 00:12:18,214
Ok Jim, thank you.
Yes. Ok, thanks.

247
00:12:20,414 --> 00:12:23,694
I've set up a meeting for
tomorrow with outside counsellor.

248
00:12:23,854 --> 00:12:25,364
- Jon Albano.
- Yeah.

249
00:12:25,624 --> 00:12:26,924
Who's the Judge in this case?

250
00:12:29,754 --> 00:12:32,194
- Constance Sweeney.
- Tough.

251
00:12:32,764 --> 00:12:35,024
- Why is that?
- Good catholic girl.

252
00:12:37,694 --> 00:12:38,694
So...

253
00:12:39,124 --> 00:12:41,054
Judging from what I've
read, it doesn't seem...

254
00:12:41,084 --> 00:12:44,014
like we've done the very thorough
investigation in the Geoghan case?

255
00:12:44,384 --> 00:12:45,414
Is that right?

256
00:12:45,544 --> 00:12:47,014
No. It's not.

257
00:12:47,444 --> 00:12:48,594
We looked hard at Geoghan.

258
00:12:48,784 --> 00:12:50,704
David Armstrong from Metro...

259
00:12:50,784 --> 00:12:52,204
and Michael Poison for Religion.

260
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,744
Ok, but... Just so
that I understand...

261
00:12:55,814 --> 00:12:57,444
beyond our daily coverage,

262
00:12:57,464 --> 00:13:00,954
we haven't committed any long
term investigative resources...

263
00:13:00,974 --> 00:13:03,744
to the question whether or not
Cardinal Law knew about this.

264
00:13:05,064 --> 00:13:06,474
No, we haven't.

265
00:13:06,864 --> 00:13:08,634
And that's the kind of
thing your team would do?

266
00:13:08,864 --> 00:13:11,993
Spotlight? Well yeah, but
we're still prospecting...

267
00:13:11,994 --> 00:13:14,254
the Boston PD story
I told you about.

268
00:13:15,274 --> 00:13:17,964
- Could you set that aside?
- We could.

269
00:13:18,274 --> 00:13:21,064
Marty, in past Spotlight's
had success in large part...

270
00:13:21,094 --> 00:13:23,294
because they picked
their own projects.

271
00:13:27,184 --> 00:13:29,034
Would you consider
picking this one?

272
00:13:30,054 --> 00:13:32,184
I don't know if he's
writing about you, but...

273
00:13:32,214 --> 00:13:34,314
I will let him know
you called. Ok, bye.

274
00:13:35,194 --> 00:13:37,444
- Hey.
- Hey, how did it go?

275
00:13:38,164 --> 00:13:43,074
Ok. Baron wants us to
scrub the Geoghan case.

276
00:13:44,764 --> 00:13:46,434
- That's great.
- Didn't we cover Geoghan?

277
00:13:46,464 --> 00:13:48,964
There's a lawyer alleging
Cardinal Law knew about it.

278
00:13:49,303 --> 00:13:50,303
Mitch Garabedian, right?

279
00:13:50,304 --> 00:13:51,954
Yeah. I covered him
at the Court House.

280
00:13:52,263 --> 00:13:53,263
Can you get to him?

281
00:13:53,264 --> 00:13:55,744
I only interviewed him once,
he's kind of a character.

282
00:13:55,764 --> 00:13:56,994
I like characters. I'll take him.

283
00:13:57,084 --> 00:13:58,264
Good, you take him.

284
00:13:58,294 --> 00:13:59,774
Also we should be talking to...

285
00:13:59,924 --> 00:14:01,944
the lawyer who repped
the victims...

286
00:14:01,964 --> 00:14:03,564
in the Porter case, Eric Macleish.

287
00:14:03,964 --> 00:14:05,564
That guy who is always on TV.

288
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,224
The Porter case? Remind me.

289
00:14:07,294 --> 00:14:09,024
Yeah, Father Porter similar story.

290
00:14:09,134 --> 00:14:11,444
Molested dozens of kids in Fall
River about 10 years ago...

291
00:14:11,474 --> 00:14:12,954
So, we're dropping the Boston PD?

292
00:14:13,094 --> 00:14:14,143
I vote yes.

293
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,744
No, we should set that
aside for now. Listen.

294
00:14:16,164 --> 00:14:18,094
I don't need to tell
you guys this...

295
00:14:18,124 --> 00:14:19,524
we need to be more
discreet than usual.

296
00:14:19,614 --> 00:14:20,614
Alright?

297
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:23,504
Everybody's gonna be interested
in this. Not just Herald.

298
00:14:24,104 --> 00:14:25,628
We can't let Cardinal
Law getting wind

299
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:27,074
of this until we
know what we have.

300
00:14:27,974 --> 00:14:29,124
Good luck with that.

301
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:36,373
When are you leaving, Nana?

302
00:14:36,374 --> 00:14:39,584
The bus is picking us up at
Church parking lot at 9 o'clock.

303
00:14:39,624 --> 00:14:42,494
- We got 40 going.
- And is Father Dominic going?

304
00:14:42,994 --> 00:14:44,384
No, he says he's unlucky.

305
00:14:44,574 --> 00:14:46,454
But luck has nothing
to do with it.

306
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,884
You know, last time Nana won $160.

307
00:14:48,885 --> 00:14:49,885
Wow

308
00:14:52,464 --> 00:14:54,164
You gonna tell her?

309
00:14:54,564 --> 00:14:55,964
We don't even know if
there's a story yet.

310
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,983
Well, "Globe sues church"?
It's gonna be a story.

311
00:15:18,664 --> 00:15:21,554
Hey Lisa, could you pull all the
relevant clips on that for me?

312
00:15:21,644 --> 00:15:22,644
Yeah.

313
00:15:23,264 --> 00:15:24,394
This is for Spotlight?

314
00:15:24,684 --> 00:15:26,814
Just drop 'em off when
they're ready, thanks.

315
00:15:29,834 --> 00:15:32,114
Excuse me, do you know where
the publishers office is?

316
00:15:33,244 --> 00:15:34,244
Will do.

317
00:15:37,894 --> 00:15:40,524
How are you Marty, settling in?

318
00:15:40,894 --> 00:15:42,744
Yeah, I think so.

319
00:15:43,074 --> 00:15:45,294
Good. What can I do for you?

320
00:15:47,924 --> 00:15:49,560
I'd like to challenge
the protective

321
00:15:49,561 --> 00:15:50,754
order in the Geoghan case.

322
00:15:51,764 --> 00:15:53,364
You want to sue the
Catholic Church?

323
00:15:55,134 --> 00:15:58,874
We're just filing the
motion, but... Yes.

324
00:16:00,004 --> 00:16:01,604
You think it's that important?

325
00:16:01,804 --> 00:16:03,104
Yes, I do.

326
00:16:03,374 --> 00:16:04,404
Because...

327
00:16:04,674 --> 00:16:07,404
Obviously the Church will
fight us very hard on this.

328
00:16:07,804 --> 00:16:10,474
Which won't go unnoticed
by our subscriber base,

329
00:16:10,504 --> 00:16:12,474
53% of them are catholic.

330
00:16:14,844 --> 00:16:16,584
I think they'll be interested.

331
00:16:20,324 --> 00:16:21,324
Ok.

332
00:16:26,764 --> 00:16:29,044
Marty, Lake street will
probably contact you...

333
00:16:29,074 --> 00:16:31,354
about face to face with
Cardinal, it's customary.

334
00:16:31,804 --> 00:16:35,274
Yeah, they already have,
it's set up for next week.

335
00:16:36,574 --> 00:16:37,884
I wouldn't mention this.

336
00:16:49,214 --> 00:16:50,214
Hello?

337
00:16:53,754 --> 00:16:54,754
Hello?

338
00:16:55,133 --> 00:16:56,133
Can I help you?

339
00:16:56,134 --> 00:16:58,374
Hi, I'm Mike Rezendes
from Boston Globe,

340
00:16:58,404 --> 00:17:00,034
I'm here to see
Mitchell Garabedian.

341
00:17:00,064 --> 00:17:02,839
He's on the call,
please have a sit.

342
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,840
Ok.

343
00:17:05,804 --> 00:17:07,324
Alright, I'm listening, go ahead.

344
00:17:10,414 --> 00:17:11,414
Ok.

345
00:17:12,044 --> 00:17:13,964
Bill, where the hell
are those papers?

346
00:17:14,054 --> 00:17:16,124
I asked you to put
them on my desk.

347
00:17:31,354 --> 00:17:34,154
The famous Walter Robinson
in my conference room.

348
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:38,274
Good to see you again Eric.
Sacha Pfeiffer, Eric Macleish.

349
00:17:38,294 --> 00:17:39,561
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

350
00:17:39,562 --> 00:17:40,642
You don't play golf, do you?

351
00:17:41,247 --> 00:17:42,247
No.

352
00:17:42,248 --> 00:17:44,594
Good. Your colleague here,
took some money of me...

353
00:17:44,624 --> 00:17:46,164
at the charity event last year.

354
00:17:46,194 --> 00:17:47,504
It was a very lucky putt, I...

355
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:49,514
actually had my eyes
closed, by the way.

356
00:17:50,644 --> 00:17:52,264
So, how can I help you guys?

357
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,064
You are familiar with
the Geoghan case?

358
00:17:56,234 --> 00:17:58,844
Sure, 80 plaintiffs.

359
00:17:58,864 --> 00:18:02,484
All of them individual cases,
Garabedian must be swimming.

360
00:18:02,594 --> 00:18:05,824
Yeah, any allegation
against Cardinal Law?

361
00:18:06,694 --> 00:18:07,894
Yeah, it's tricky.

362
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:10,841
This is what you
need to understand,

363
00:18:10,842 --> 00:18:11,842
these are shitty cases.

364
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:16,184
Statute of limitation is only
3 years, and most of these...

365
00:18:16,214 --> 00:18:18,784
victims don't come forward
till long after that.

366
00:18:19,044 --> 00:18:20,554
Why is that?

367
00:18:21,044 --> 00:18:23,554
Well they're kids, you
know? Guilt, shame...

368
00:18:23,674 --> 00:18:25,664
And most of these kids come
from tough neighbourhood,

369
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:28,554
nobody wants to admit
this kind of thing, so...

370
00:18:29,114 --> 00:18:32,484
you're screwed on the
time moment, and...

371
00:18:33,224 --> 00:18:34,925
even if you argue
your way around that,

372
00:18:34,926 --> 00:18:36,414
the charitable immunity statute...

373
00:18:36,494 --> 00:18:38,474
caps damages at 20 grand.

374
00:18:39,364 --> 00:18:41,864
20 grand, for molesting a child?

375
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:45,984
That is the way the
system is set up, yes.

376
00:18:46,064 --> 00:18:49,684
The Church is tough, so...

377
00:18:49,694 --> 00:18:51,834
your best shot is to try
this cases in the press.

378
00:18:52,074 --> 00:18:54,254
Like I did on Porter.

379
00:18:54,774 --> 00:18:56,913
But you know, most of the
victims they don't wanna...

380
00:18:56,914 --> 00:18:57,954
have anything do to with TV...

381
00:18:57,974 --> 00:19:03,134
and Mitch isn't exactly
a people person.

382
00:19:03,614 --> 00:19:05,359
Yeah, if Garabedian
can't get these

383
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,104
victims just go
before the press...

384
00:19:07,204 --> 00:19:08,344
that is really...

385
00:19:08,374 --> 00:19:12,074
That's right, and he has a
long road ahead of him.

386
00:19:12,164 --> 00:19:15,714
My guess is, he doesn't
have anything on Law.

387
00:19:16,734 --> 00:19:18,314
What do you think, he's bluffing?

388
00:19:18,734 --> 00:19:21,014
I think he's grandstanding...

389
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,494
to cut a better deal.

390
00:19:23,174 --> 00:19:25,344
Seems a bit reckless.

391
00:19:26,174 --> 00:19:27,644
Have you met Mitch Garabedian?

392
00:19:28,644 --> 00:19:30,854
I asked you to write
me that motion Bill,

393
00:19:30,954 --> 00:19:32,864
I didn't ask you to file it.

394
00:19:43,054 --> 00:19:44,194
Hey Bill...

395
00:19:56,234 --> 00:19:57,234
Hi.

396
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:58,959
Who are you?

397
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,014
I'm Mike Rezendes
from Boston Globe...

398
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,634
I had an appointment with
you, about an hour ago.

399
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,164
I can't talk to you,
I'm busy. Sharon.

400
00:20:04,214 --> 00:20:06,374
She went for coffee, she
said she'll be right back.

401
00:20:06,404 --> 00:20:08,264
I'm following up on an article...

402
00:20:08,884 --> 00:20:10,604
- The one in the Phoenix?
- No, in the Globe.

403
00:20:11,354 --> 00:20:13,184
Did you see the one
in the Phoenix?

404
00:20:13,185 --> 00:20:14,283
No, I didn't.

405
00:20:14,284 --> 00:20:16,454
I thought it was very good, I
have a copy here somewhere.

406
00:20:16,484 --> 00:20:17,674
It's alright, I'll track it down.

407
00:20:18,094 --> 00:20:19,624
I'm actually following
up on a column...

408
00:20:19,664 --> 00:20:21,994
that Eileen McNamara
wrote about your suit.

409
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:24,084
Suits, 84 of them.

410
00:20:24,114 --> 00:20:26,684
It's not a class action, you
should get your facts straight.

411
00:20:26,714 --> 00:20:27,714
No, you're right, I should.

412
00:20:28,364 --> 00:20:30,314
So, I'm trying to get some
background information...

413
00:20:30,344 --> 00:20:31,774
You are not recording
this, are you?

414
00:20:32,674 --> 00:20:34,434
No, I wouldn't do
that without asking.

415
00:20:34,464 --> 00:20:35,804
I can't show you the
Church documents...

416
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,574
if that's what you're
after. They're under seal.

417
00:20:38,444 --> 00:20:39,444
Yeah, I know that.

418
00:20:40,484 --> 00:20:41,918
Did you know that they
try to bring me up...

419
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,924
before the Massachusetts Board
of Bar Overseers 3 times?

420
00:20:45,034 --> 00:20:46,294
They are watching me very closely.

421
00:20:46,324 --> 00:20:48,814
- The Church?
- Yeah, the Church. Yeah.

422
00:20:48,844 --> 00:20:51,304
They'd like to get me disbarred,
in fact... Put that away.

423
00:20:52,004 --> 00:20:53,084
- Put it away.
- Sure.

424
00:20:53,524 --> 00:20:55,994
I don't want you recording this
in any way, shape or form.

425
00:20:56,014 --> 00:20:57,452
Not on paper, not
on tape, nothing.

426
00:20:57,453 --> 00:20:58,483
Ok.

427
00:20:58,484 --> 00:21:00,264
In fact, I probably shouldn't
even be speaking to you.

428
00:21:00,714 --> 00:21:02,754
Look, Mr Garabedian,
I know there's...

429
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:05,704
things, you cannot tell me, but...

430
00:21:05,714 --> 00:21:06,934
I also know there's a story here.

431
00:21:07,034 --> 00:21:08,474
And I think it's an
important story.

432
00:21:08,544 --> 00:21:09,904
I already talked to the Phoenix.

433
00:21:09,905 --> 00:21:11,624
Yeah, there's a reason
I didn't see it.

434
00:21:12,114 --> 00:21:14,214
Nobody reads a Phoenix any more...

435
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,214
they're broke, they
don't have any power.

436
00:21:16,314 --> 00:21:17,464
The Globe does.

437
00:21:18,354 --> 00:21:20,734
If we cover the story,
everybody will hear about it.

438
00:21:22,624 --> 00:21:24,924
The Church thinks in
centuries, Mr Rezendes.

439
00:21:25,214 --> 00:21:28,284
Do you think your paper has
resources to take that on?

440
00:21:28,314 --> 00:21:29,404
Yeah, I do.

441
00:21:30,234 --> 00:21:33,684
But if you don't mind
me asking... Do you?

442
00:21:35,204 --> 00:21:38,164
I can't talk to you right now, Mr
Rezendes. I'm very, very busy.

443
00:21:41,744 --> 00:21:42,813
- Sharon.
- Thank you.

444
00:21:42,814 --> 00:21:43,814
Yeah, yeah.

445
00:21:44,044 --> 00:21:45,714
Can I at least talk to
some of the clients?

446
00:21:45,754 --> 00:21:47,594
Victims? I'd really
like to do that.

447
00:21:48,854 --> 00:21:50,254
Call me tomorrow, I got
to think about it.

448
00:21:50,255 --> 00:21:51,972
- Thank you.
- Yeah, yeah.

449
00:22:16,344 --> 00:22:18,414
A FAMILIAR PATTERN

450
00:22:26,154 --> 00:22:28,954
Porter faces Mass. Court
as '87 abuse claim arises.

451
00:22:44,774 --> 00:22:46,260
I got more clips from the library.

452
00:22:46,261 --> 00:22:47,264
Leave 'em right there.

453
00:22:48,444 --> 00:22:50,604
Are you guys doing a
story on the Church?

454
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:52,774
No, we are not doing a
story on the Church.

455
00:22:53,384 --> 00:22:56,414
Matt. You find anything
on this guy Phil Saviano?

456
00:22:56,504 --> 00:22:58,064
No. Who is he?

457
00:22:58,184 --> 00:22:59,944
He's part of a victims
organisation.

458
00:23:00,124 --> 00:23:02,744
Kurkjian did a story on him
right after the Porter case.

459
00:23:02,774 --> 00:23:04,604
There's a victims' organisation?

460
00:23:04,954 --> 00:23:06,584
Yeah. It's called SNAP.

461
00:23:06,604 --> 00:23:08,954
It's Survivors Network of
those Abused by Priest.

462
00:23:09,034 --> 00:23:10,304
Crummy acronym.

463
00:23:13,334 --> 00:23:15,564
- Want me to track him down?
- Yeah, bring him in.

464
00:23:16,304 --> 00:23:18,304
How much longer do you need
to get through the clips?

465
00:23:18,454 --> 00:23:20,864
I mean, a few days, there's a lot.

466
00:23:20,904 --> 00:23:22,434
- Lisa is still sending it more.
- Ok.

467
00:23:22,454 --> 00:23:25,214
Hey guys, I think I
got another Priest.

468
00:23:26,484 --> 00:23:29,534
Liam Barrett. Molested
some kids in Philly,

469
00:23:30,084 --> 00:23:33,894
and was moved to Boston, did the
same thing and was moved again.

470
00:23:34,084 --> 00:23:35,354
Really? That sounds like Geoghan.

471
00:23:35,554 --> 00:23:36,714
Is that one of our clips?

472
00:23:36,774 --> 00:23:40,174
Yeah, Byline's Diego Ribadeneira,
1997. Must've been back

473
00:23:40,194 --> 00:23:41,914
when he was working religion.

474
00:23:42,294 --> 00:23:44,824
- Was there any follow?
- Not much, only show one piece.

475
00:23:45,964 --> 00:23:47,634
The Church settled the case.

476
00:23:50,574 --> 00:23:52,204
Don't you know Jim Sullivan?

477
00:23:53,074 --> 00:23:54,204
Yeah. Why?

478
00:23:54,974 --> 00:23:56,604
Looks like the Church
brought him in to help out.

479
00:24:05,184 --> 00:24:07,410
Jesus. Has anybody
but Manny gotten

480
00:24:07,411 --> 00:24:09,204
the ball out of the infield?

481
00:24:10,094 --> 00:24:12,064
Why do you even bother
with that thing?

482
00:24:12,194 --> 00:24:14,264
It distracts me from the game.

483
00:24:14,424 --> 00:24:16,424
You know what else
is good for that?

484
00:24:16,614 --> 00:24:19,694
Oh, yeah. Good idea, buy a
round. I'll be right back.

485
00:24:20,264 --> 00:24:23,164
- Anybody want any food?
- A Hotdog.

486
00:24:25,744 --> 00:24:29,024
- So you guys making any progress?
- Absolutely, it's a good story.

487
00:24:29,044 --> 00:24:33,164
Why? Because you're another lapsed
catholic pissed off at the Church?

488
00:24:33,184 --> 00:24:34,974
- We got a lot of good stuff.
- Like what?

489
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:38,894
I'm just watching
the game. Omerta.

490
00:24:39,224 --> 00:24:41,476
They got another
priest, Liam Barrett.

491
00:24:41,477 --> 00:24:42,477
We reported it.

492
00:24:43,454 --> 00:24:44,554
I'm just saying, we did.

493
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:46,174
Ok, but this guy was
shuffled a lot...

494
00:24:46,204 --> 00:24:47,764
from parish to parish
every few years...

495
00:24:47,784 --> 00:24:50,214
just like Geoghan and Porter.
I think there's a pattern.

496
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,714
Sounds thin. What else you got?

497
00:24:54,204 --> 00:24:55,897
Sacha's got another guy from a

498
00:24:55,898 --> 00:24:57,984
victims organisation.
Phil Saviano.

499
00:24:58,114 --> 00:25:01,124
From SNAP? O boy, we
reported on him too.

500
00:25:01,144 --> 00:25:02,624
I thought you were
watching a game, Steve.

501
00:25:03,014 --> 00:25:04,379
That guy's pretty banged up, Mike.

502
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,634
We did a couple stories on him.

503
00:25:05,744 --> 00:25:07,644
Guy would not stop
writing letters.

504
00:25:07,784 --> 00:25:08,784
He wants a holy war.

505
00:25:08,854 --> 00:25:11,394
- So, he's not worth talking to?
- Where are you on Garabedian?

506
00:25:11,453 --> 00:25:12,453
I'm working on it.

507
00:25:12,454 --> 00:25:14,494
Robby say Macleish
thinks he's bluffing.

508
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:17,214
I think there's
something there Ben.

509
00:25:17,524 --> 00:25:19,214
Get me something solid or
I'm taking you off him.

510
00:25:19,294 --> 00:25:21,354
I don't want us chasing
our tails on this.

511
00:25:30,934 --> 00:25:32,004
Stay away from that trap.

512
00:25:32,814 --> 00:25:35,204
You couldn't reach that trap
in a million years partner.

513
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:38,504
I could reach that trap before.
Yeah. Now Paul, maybe.

514
00:25:40,214 --> 00:25:42,074
- How we doing?
- Good.

515
00:25:42,114 --> 00:25:43,944
We're two up in the front.

516
00:25:45,724 --> 00:25:47,642
How's that new editor working out?

517
00:25:47,643 --> 00:25:49,404
Well, he doesn't like baseball.

518
00:25:49,894 --> 00:25:53,084
But, he seems like a smart guy.

519
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:55,964
Yeah, I read an article
about him, said he's a...

520
00:25:56,684 --> 00:25:58,284
first Jewish editor of The Globe.

521
00:25:59,064 --> 00:26:00,714
Must have been a slow news day.

522
00:26:02,134 --> 00:26:05,924
- He got a family, this guy?
- No, he is not married.

523
00:26:06,204 --> 00:26:08,794
- Divorced?
- I don't think so, no.

524
00:26:09,314 --> 00:26:11,374
So, the new editor of The
Globe is not married man...

525
00:26:11,414 --> 00:26:13,444
of the Jewish faith
who hates baseball.

526
00:26:13,999 --> 00:26:14,999
Yeah.

527
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,244
They should have given it to Ben.

528
00:26:17,014 --> 00:26:18,204
He's a Bradlee for
crying out loud.

529
00:26:18,234 --> 00:26:20,814
Didn't raise his hand
fast enough I guess.

530
00:26:22,354 --> 00:26:24,964
Hey by the way, I've been
reading about this priest...

531
00:26:24,994 --> 00:26:27,274
Father Barrett, said you
were involved with that?

532
00:26:27,864 --> 00:26:29,814
Barrett yeah, bad egg.

533
00:26:30,454 --> 00:26:32,734
Lake Street asked for
help, I pitched in.

534
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:35,744
Victims said Cardinal
Law knew about...

535
00:26:35,784 --> 00:26:38,354
Barrett, when he came to
Philly. Is that true?

536
00:26:39,044 --> 00:26:41,134
You know I can't talk
about the case Robby.

537
00:26:43,574 --> 00:26:44,774
Off the record?

538
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,634
Off the record, I
can't talk about it.

539
00:26:48,644 --> 00:26:51,914
- This related to a lawsuit?
- You know about that?

540
00:26:53,234 --> 00:26:54,454
Look.

541
00:26:55,284 --> 00:26:56,644
I don't know this guy Baron...

542
00:26:56,744 --> 00:26:58,834
or what his agenda is,
frankly I don't care.

543
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:03,004
I just don't wanna see you
taking a bullet for him.

544
00:27:03,034 --> 00:27:04,334
I think you're wise.

545
00:27:10,094 --> 00:27:11,684
- Right over here.
- Lets go, lets go.

546
00:27:12,004 --> 00:27:14,884
So the other day I was
on the world wide web.

547
00:27:15,714 --> 00:27:18,844
Anything you wanna know,
it's right there.

548
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:22,254
Now, I have to admit
that as a priest,

549
00:27:22,284 --> 00:27:24,134
this makes me a little nervous.

550
00:27:24,714 --> 00:27:27,454
Should I be worried
about job security?

551
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:30,454
I don't think so.

552
00:27:30,794 --> 00:27:37,464
You see... Knowledge is one thing,
but faith. Faith is another.

553
00:27:52,984 --> 00:27:55,364
- Hey.
- Hey.

554
00:27:57,584 --> 00:27:59,949
So should we golfing or something?

555
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,674
"Golfing" is not a verb.

556
00:28:02,424 --> 00:28:04,404
And I couldn't get a tee time.

557
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:06,134
Is that what they
call it, tee time?

558
00:28:06,794 --> 00:28:08,744
They also call it a
leisure activity.

559
00:28:08,774 --> 00:28:10,114
You oughta try it Mike.

560
00:28:10,134 --> 00:28:13,204
- I do, I run.
- Yeah, you run to work.

561
00:28:16,374 --> 00:28:17,784
So why are you here today?

562
00:28:18,034 --> 00:28:20,324
Going over this clips of Saviano.

563
00:28:20,364 --> 00:28:22,624
Yeah, Ben and Steve
thinks it's a dead end.

564
00:28:22,844 --> 00:28:24,694
They gave me a bunch of
crap about it at the game.

565
00:28:24,774 --> 00:28:27,324
- Yeah, Ben emailed me.
- He did?

566
00:28:27,684 --> 00:28:30,524
Yeah, He said we should let it go.

567
00:28:30,984 --> 00:28:32,324
What do you wanna do?

568
00:28:33,624 --> 00:28:35,454
We bring Saviano in.

569
00:28:35,624 --> 00:28:37,954
So, just ignore those guys?

570
00:28:41,294 --> 00:28:44,344
I think we got to start
ignoring everybody on this one.

571
00:28:44,374 --> 00:28:45,484
I'm good at that.

572
00:28:50,774 --> 00:28:54,004
You think Marty has any idea
what's coming down the Pike?

573
00:28:54,034 --> 00:28:56,724
No, I don't think he cares either.

574
00:28:57,344 --> 00:28:58,514
That's refreshing.

575
00:28:59,254 --> 00:29:00,254
Yeah.

576
00:29:02,414 --> 00:29:03,754
Unless he's wrong.

577
00:29:22,874 --> 00:29:25,884
I have always been fascinated
with the newspaper business.

578
00:29:26,374 --> 00:29:28,264
I used to sit in on
the lectures with...

579
00:29:28,294 --> 00:29:30,154
the Nieman fellows,
when I was at Harvard.

580
00:29:31,844 --> 00:29:34,484
I read that you were
an editor once.

581
00:29:35,624 --> 00:29:39,204
Yes. That was a
very long time ago.

582
00:29:39,654 --> 00:29:43,344
The Mississippi Register. Small.

583
00:29:43,684 --> 00:29:45,704
Diocese in newspaper.

584
00:29:46,364 --> 00:29:50,994
But for 30 year old Pastor
it was a big responsibility.

585
00:29:52,134 --> 00:29:53,574
Too much at times.

586
00:29:54,904 --> 00:29:55,904
How so?

587
00:29:57,834 --> 00:29:59,994
I was close with the
Evers brothers,

588
00:30:00,284 --> 00:30:02,924
we took a stand on civil rights.

589
00:30:02,944 --> 00:30:05,304
Our readership was not pleased.

590
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:08,454
They saw me as meddling outsider.

591
00:30:09,914 --> 00:30:11,114
I can imagine.

592
00:30:11,784 --> 00:30:15,464
Tough sit to sit in,
especially in a small town.

593
00:30:16,394 --> 00:30:18,144
I think you'll find
that Boston's...

594
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:20,854
still a small town too, Marty.

595
00:30:21,044 --> 00:30:22,394
In any ways.

596
00:30:23,234 --> 00:30:27,734
But if I can be of any help,
Marty, don't hesitate to ask.

597
00:30:28,304 --> 00:30:31,404
I find that the city flourishes...

598
00:30:31,514 --> 00:30:33,594
when its grand institution
works together.

599
00:30:35,204 --> 00:30:37,744
Thank you. Personally,
I'm of the opinion...

600
00:30:37,784 --> 00:30:40,294
that for the paper to
best perform its function

601
00:30:41,084 --> 00:30:42,304
it really needs to stand alone.

602
00:30:45,514 --> 00:30:50,414
Of course. But my
offer still stands.

603
00:30:50,444 --> 00:30:51,444
Thank you.

604
00:30:53,624 --> 00:30:54,624
Come in.

605
00:30:58,234 --> 00:30:59,434
Thank you, Maureen.

606
00:31:02,164 --> 00:31:03,404
Little gift, Marty.

607
00:31:04,974 --> 00:31:09,014
Think of it as a Cardinal's
guide to the city of Boston.

608
00:31:15,344 --> 00:31:17,894
CATHOLIC CHURCHCATECHISM

609
00:31:26,364 --> 00:31:29,244
- I'm here to see Sacha Pfeiffer.
- Your name?

610
00:31:29,264 --> 00:31:31,934
- Phil Saviano.
- Ok, just a minute.

611
00:31:34,064 --> 00:31:35,994
So, am I first
survivor you talk to?

612
00:31:36,334 --> 00:31:38,984
- Yeah, sure you are.
- Ok, well...

613
00:31:40,004 --> 00:31:43,204
First of all, let me say thank
you for having me in today.

614
00:31:44,014 --> 00:31:45,453
And I want you to know
that you'll have...

615
00:31:45,454 --> 00:31:47,874
the full cooperation of
my organisation, SNAP.

616
00:31:48,214 --> 00:31:50,834
How many members are in
your organisation Phil?

617
00:31:50,864 --> 00:31:53,054
We had eleven at our
last chapter meeting.

618
00:31:53,084 --> 00:31:55,604
No ten, Karen just moved.

619
00:31:55,684 --> 00:31:57,564
You had a woman in your group?

620
00:31:57,594 --> 00:31:58,954
Of course there was a woman,

621
00:31:58,964 --> 00:32:00,664
they don't discriminate, not
when it comes to abuse.

622
00:32:00,764 --> 00:32:02,464
And this has nothing
to do with being gay.

623
00:32:02,494 --> 00:32:05,204
What this is, is priest using
the collar to rape kids.

624
00:32:05,694 --> 00:32:07,184
Kids, boys and girls.

625
00:32:11,894 --> 00:32:14,244
PHIL SAVIANO AGE 11

626
00:32:14,644 --> 00:32:16,034
I was 11.

627
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:19,034
And I was preyed upon
by Father David Holly.

628
00:32:19,064 --> 00:32:20,064
In Worcester.

629
00:32:20,684 --> 00:32:23,094
And I don't mean prayed
for, I mean preyed upon.

630
00:32:25,284 --> 00:32:26,594
Are any of you catholic?

631
00:32:26,824 --> 00:32:28,733
I was raised catholic,

632
00:32:28,734 --> 00:32:30,714
now I go to my wife's
Presbyterian Church.

633
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:35,174
I'm lapsed, I go to Church
of my grandmother sometimes.

634
00:32:35,594 --> 00:32:39,074
It's safe to say we were all
raised catholic, but now...

635
00:32:39,094 --> 00:32:40,204
Not so much.

636
00:32:40,234 --> 00:32:42,004
Ok, well let me tell you...

637
00:32:42,874 --> 00:32:45,394
When you are poor kid
from a poor family,

638
00:32:45,424 --> 00:32:46,664
religion counts for a lot.

639
00:32:46,704 --> 00:32:49,764
And when a priest pays attention
to you, it's a big deal.

640
00:32:50,444 --> 00:32:51,954
He asks you to collect the hymnals

641
00:32:51,994 --> 00:32:54,004
or take out a trash,
you feel special.

642
00:32:54,144 --> 00:32:56,454
It's like God asking for help.

643
00:32:56,754 --> 00:32:59,064
Maybe it's a little weird when
he tells you a dirty joke...

644
00:32:59,124 --> 00:33:01,774
but now you got a secret together.

645
00:33:02,024 --> 00:33:03,434
So you go along.

646
00:33:04,054 --> 00:33:06,074
Then he shows you a porno mag.

647
00:33:06,114 --> 00:33:08,604
And then you go along,
and you go along...

648
00:33:08,634 --> 00:33:09,934
And you go along.

649
00:33:09,964 --> 00:33:13,254
Until one day he asks you to jerk
him off or give him a blowjob.

650
00:33:13,274 --> 00:33:15,264
And so you go along with that too.

651
00:33:15,274 --> 00:33:18,764
Because you feel trapped,
because he has groomed you.

652
00:33:20,004 --> 00:33:21,644
How do you say no to God, right?

653
00:33:22,294 --> 00:33:23,644
See...

654
00:33:24,714 --> 00:33:26,314
It is important to understand
that this is not...

655
00:33:26,315 --> 00:33:28,805
just physical abuse, it's
spiritual abuse too.

656
00:33:29,714 --> 00:33:31,784
Then when a priest
does this to you,

657
00:33:31,794 --> 00:33:33,784
he robs you of your faith.

658
00:33:34,784 --> 00:33:37,334
So you reach for the
bottle, or the needle.

659
00:33:37,494 --> 00:33:39,294
Or if those don't work
you jump of a bridge.

660
00:33:39,824 --> 00:33:41,414
That's why we call
ourselves survivors.

661
00:33:41,454 --> 00:33:43,014
Have you read Jason Berry's book,

662
00:33:43,044 --> 00:33:45,234
he wrote about a Gauthe
case in Louisiana.

663
00:33:45,264 --> 00:33:46,764
- That's G...
- G-a-u-t-h-e.

664
00:33:47,094 --> 00:33:49,654
I talked to Richard Sipe,
he worked in one of...

665
00:33:49,684 --> 00:33:51,284
the Church's treatment centre.

666
00:33:51,334 --> 00:33:54,464
He is an ex-priest. Married a nun.

667
00:33:55,604 --> 00:33:58,694
Yeah. This is his testimony
from the Cass case.

668
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:00,614
Phil, what's a treatment centre?

669
00:34:00,714 --> 00:34:02,484
It's where they send priests
when they get caught...

670
00:34:02,554 --> 00:34:03,744
this is all right here in the box.

671
00:34:03,754 --> 00:34:05,804
I sent this all to you
guys 5 years ago.

672
00:34:06,354 --> 00:34:09,144
To The Globe? Who
did you send it to?

673
00:34:11,353 --> 00:34:12,353
I don't wanna say who,

674
00:34:12,354 --> 00:34:13,954
but they said that they
weren't interested.

675
00:34:14,294 --> 00:34:15,705
But Phil, We did run
a couple stories

676
00:34:15,706 --> 00:34:17,004
on you, I saw them in the clips...

677
00:34:17,034 --> 00:34:20,134
Yeah, but to be completely
frank it wasn't enough.

678
00:34:22,064 --> 00:34:24,114
You guys gotta understand.

679
00:34:24,464 --> 00:34:26,114
This is big.

680
00:34:26,134 --> 00:34:29,664
This is not just Boston, this is a
whole country, it's a whole world.

681
00:34:30,214 --> 00:34:31,964
And it goes right
up to the Vatican.

682
00:34:32,784 --> 00:34:34,606
Do you have any proof
of that, Phil?

683
00:34:34,607 --> 00:34:35,607
No, not yet.

684
00:34:35,608 --> 00:34:37,324
But think about it, there
are so many of them.

685
00:34:37,364 --> 00:34:39,334
How else could they have
hidden it for so long?

686
00:34:39,354 --> 00:34:40,984
- So many what?
- Priests.

687
00:34:42,154 --> 00:34:46,674
Priests. I know 13
right here in Boston.

688
00:34:46,894 --> 00:34:50,264
You know 13 priest in Boston
who have molested children?

689
00:34:50,454 --> 00:34:52,604
Yeah, why do you keep
repeating everything I say?

690
00:34:53,234 --> 00:34:55,154
I just like to clarify things.

691
00:34:55,174 --> 00:34:57,154
Maybe you should've
clarified it 5 years ago...

692
00:34:57,184 --> 00:34:59,104
when I sent you all of this stuff,

693
00:34:59,214 --> 00:35:01,104
It's all right here.

694
00:35:10,014 --> 00:35:13,094
- May I use your bathroom?
- Yeah, sure Phil.

695
00:35:13,284 --> 00:35:14,394
Come on.

696
00:35:21,224 --> 00:35:23,554
Well... What do you think?

697
00:35:24,534 --> 00:35:26,237
The guy's got an agenda,
that's for sure.

698
00:35:26,238 --> 00:35:27,238
You think?

699
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:29,264
He's obviously been through a
lot, but he's smart and...

700
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:30,654
if he's right about
thirteen priests...

701
00:35:30,674 --> 00:35:32,644
Yeah, and might be a
big if with this guy.

702
00:35:32,684 --> 00:35:34,134
Do a background check on him.

703
00:35:34,214 --> 00:35:36,334
And follow up some of the other
survivors of this group.

704
00:35:36,354 --> 00:35:38,164
I'll track down this
ex-priest Sipe.

705
00:35:38,394 --> 00:35:41,044
Ok, but stay on Garabedian,
that's more important.

706
00:35:41,444 --> 00:35:43,394
Garabedian, what a
pain in the ass.

707
00:35:43,624 --> 00:35:45,584
You can be a pain
in the ass, Mike.

708
00:35:58,834 --> 00:36:00,704
Mitchell, what a
surprise. How are you?

709
00:36:00,864 --> 00:36:02,154
I'm fine Mr Rezendes.

710
00:36:02,264 --> 00:36:04,054
Good, you know, I've never
heard back from you...

711
00:36:04,144 --> 00:36:05,214
I left you a couple of messages.

712
00:36:05,234 --> 00:36:07,454
I know. I've been very busy,
I don't have time for calls.

713
00:36:07,484 --> 00:36:09,334
Geez, I'm sure you don't.
Listen, listen Mitch.

714
00:36:09,754 --> 00:36:11,384
Let me talk to the
couple of victims.

715
00:36:11,654 --> 00:36:13,084
You can sit in on the interview...

716
00:36:13,114 --> 00:36:14,594
and if you're not
happy, you can kill it.

717
00:36:14,624 --> 00:36:16,774
I spoke to my clients and they
don't want to be in the press.

718
00:36:16,784 --> 00:36:17,784
I'm sorry.

719
00:36:17,785 --> 00:36:19,674
I get that, but I don't
need to name their names.

720
00:36:20,324 --> 00:36:21,553
I don't believe you Mr Rezendes.

721
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,554
I'm sure you don't.

722
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:25,134
- Listen Mitchell.
- Mr Rezendes, please...

723
00:36:25,164 --> 00:36:28,184
I'm not writing a profile here,
I'm working on something bigger.

724
00:36:28,214 --> 00:36:29,894
Bigger? I don't know
what that means.

725
00:36:30,364 --> 00:36:31,697
I'm not supposed to
tell you this but

726
00:36:31,698 --> 00:36:32,854
I'm digging a run for Spotlight.

727
00:36:35,103 --> 00:36:36,103
Spotlight is on this?

728
00:36:36,104 --> 00:36:38,004
Yeah, we're looking into
it but you gotta help me.

729
00:36:38,804 --> 00:36:41,324
You gotta let me talk to some
of these victims, please.

730
00:36:44,674 --> 00:36:45,674
Please.

731
00:36:49,184 --> 00:36:52,474
- Come back tomorrow at 9:30 a.m.
- Thank you.

732
00:37:06,034 --> 00:37:07,364
- Ms Pfeiffer.
- Joe.

733
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:08,394
Hi.

734
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:09,564
- Shit.
- That's ok.

735
00:37:09,584 --> 00:37:11,944
- I'm sorry. Please sit.
- No problem. Thank you.

736
00:37:12,374 --> 00:37:15,014
- Is this table ok?
- This is perfect.

737
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:19,614
I had a muffin while I was
waiting, two actually.

738
00:37:20,414 --> 00:37:21,754
I eat when I'm nervous.

739
00:37:21,784 --> 00:37:23,094
I did that too actually.

740
00:37:23,814 --> 00:37:27,524
I hope I'm not late. Phil
told me one o'clock.

741
00:37:27,554 --> 00:37:31,234
No, you're fine. I got
here early. About an hour.

742
00:37:34,394 --> 00:37:37,324
Would you mind if I took some
notes? Would that be alright?

743
00:37:42,704 --> 00:37:44,944
You don't mind if I take
some notes, do you?

744
00:37:44,974 --> 00:37:46,494
You got to use my name?

745
00:37:46,524 --> 00:37:47,524
No.

746
00:37:48,674 --> 00:37:49,884
I'm not if you don't
want me to, no.

747
00:37:50,164 --> 00:37:53,714
I just had a kid, he's only 1...

748
00:37:53,734 --> 00:37:55,954
but I'm not sure I want
him to know about this.

749
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,554
Sure, I get that.

750
00:37:57,584 --> 00:37:59,764
You can stop this interview
at any time Patrick.

751
00:38:00,184 --> 00:38:01,274
- Alright?
- Ok.

752
00:38:01,364 --> 00:38:02,374
Alright.

753
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:07,874
- You go ahead with your notes.
- Ok, so...

754
00:38:10,694 --> 00:38:13,324
Where did you live when
it first happened?

755
00:38:13,354 --> 00:38:15,694
In the Projects,
over in Hyde Park.

756
00:38:16,164 --> 00:38:20,134
- Over by the Stop & Shop?
- Yeah, you know it?

757
00:38:20,704 --> 00:38:22,715
Yeah, I drove a cab
for a few years.

758
00:38:22,716 --> 00:38:24,454
Opens early, bad coffee, right?

759
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,664
Yeah, I guess.

760
00:38:28,684 --> 00:38:31,224
How old were you,
when it happened?

761
00:38:31,264 --> 00:38:33,024
I was 12.

762
00:38:34,264 --> 00:38:36,024
Just after my dad killed himself.

763
00:38:36,754 --> 00:38:39,724
- Oh, geez.
- He was a real piece of shit.

764
00:38:40,464 --> 00:38:42,764
And my mum she wasn't
so stable either.

765
00:38:43,264 --> 00:38:45,024
- How do you mean?
- I mean she was nuts.

766
00:38:45,194 --> 00:38:48,374
- She was schizophrenic.
- Same shit.

767
00:38:51,074 --> 00:38:54,574
When did you first meet Geoghan?

768
00:38:54,614 --> 00:38:58,084
Well, my sister... she saw him
over at the Dunking Donuts...

769
00:38:58,714 --> 00:39:01,724
tells him about my old man passing
and he rushed right over.

770
00:39:01,944 --> 00:39:04,334
And there was this nun sister
Barbara, and she ran this group...

771
00:39:04,354 --> 00:39:05,874
for kids from troubled families.

772
00:39:07,154 --> 00:39:10,144
- Where is that?
- St. Ambrose in Dorchester.

773
00:39:10,174 --> 00:39:11,444
Ok.

774
00:39:12,324 --> 00:39:14,534
She's the one who introduced
me to Father Shanley.

775
00:39:16,194 --> 00:39:20,414
He was a street priest,
long hair, very hip.

776
00:39:21,804 --> 00:39:23,932
He invited me to his
apartment in Back Bay.

777
00:39:23,933 --> 00:39:25,033
Where in Back Bay?

778
00:39:25,034 --> 00:39:28,094
- Beacon street.
- Beacon, ok.

779
00:39:28,204 --> 00:39:29,544
Are you from here?

780
00:39:29,584 --> 00:39:33,054
No, I grew up in Ohio, but
my mum is from Southie.

781
00:39:33,084 --> 00:39:36,164
So you get it. I've never
even seen Back Bay.

782
00:39:38,014 --> 00:39:40,704
So, what happened on
that first visit Joe?

783
00:39:41,684 --> 00:39:45,454
Well it was very nice at first.
Very funny. Very casual.

784
00:39:46,864 --> 00:39:49,744
And I think he could
tell I was gay.

785
00:39:49,784 --> 00:39:52,324
So he showed me
this mobile he had,

786
00:39:52,384 --> 00:39:53,624
like over a baby's crib?

787
00:39:54,634 --> 00:39:56,484
But with different words,

788
00:39:56,634 --> 00:39:59,484
homosexual, transexual,
bisexual...

789
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:02,754
Ok. And did you know that you
were gay at that time, Joe?

790
00:40:03,274 --> 00:40:06,674
Yes, but that wasn't information
I'm sharing with anybody.

791
00:40:06,774 --> 00:40:07,964
Not in Dorchester.

792
00:40:09,414 --> 00:40:10,664
Ok.

793
00:40:10,914 --> 00:40:14,064
So, what happened after
he showed you the mobile?

794
00:40:14,094 --> 00:40:15,554
Well, I was a little freaked out.

795
00:40:17,024 --> 00:40:18,474
I think he could tell...

796
00:40:19,524 --> 00:40:20,974
So he said, you know
what will help...

797
00:40:20,994 --> 00:40:23,024
is if we play strip poker.

798
00:40:24,934 --> 00:40:26,474
Of course I lost.

799
00:40:28,104 --> 00:40:29,834
And things went on from there.

800
00:40:31,374 --> 00:40:33,384
Can you tell me
specifically what happened?

801
00:40:35,074 --> 00:40:38,474
Specifically... He molested me.

802
00:40:42,384 --> 00:40:46,074
Joe, I think that the language is
going to be so important here.

803
00:40:46,654 --> 00:40:49,854
We can't sanitise this, just
saying 'molest' isn't enough.

804
00:40:50,094 --> 00:40:52,784
People need to know
what actually happened.

805
00:40:55,864 --> 00:40:57,784
We should probably
get these to go.

806
00:40:57,785 --> 00:40:58,793
Right.

807
00:40:58,794 --> 00:41:01,064
Geoghan shows up and my
mum, you know she's...

808
00:41:02,164 --> 00:41:04,114
She's thrilled. And...

809
00:41:05,034 --> 00:41:07,054
this was like God
showing up, you know?

810
00:41:07,084 --> 00:41:08,084
Sure, right.

811
00:41:08,474 --> 00:41:09,724
So what happened then?

812
00:41:13,074 --> 00:41:15,094
You really wanna hear this shit?

813
00:41:15,124 --> 00:41:16,414
Yeah, yeah Patrick, I do.

814
00:41:25,194 --> 00:41:26,964
He offers to take me
to get ice cream.

815
00:41:27,524 --> 00:41:30,104
He's a priest. I'm a kid so I go.

816
00:41:31,024 --> 00:41:32,024
Sure.

817
00:41:32,834 --> 00:41:34,964
So we're driving home, and he...

818
00:41:37,674 --> 00:41:39,284
He starts patting my leg.

819
00:41:41,504 --> 00:41:42,744
You know, then...

820
00:41:44,414 --> 00:41:48,034
His hand just slides
right up and...

821
00:41:48,064 --> 00:41:50,804
he grabs my dick, alright?

822
00:41:51,414 --> 00:41:53,514
I just froze up, I was
fucking petrified...

823
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:54,784
I couldn't move.

824
00:41:56,084 --> 00:41:58,044
I didn't know what to do,
I was just a little kid.

825
00:42:00,444 --> 00:42:01,584
Yeah.

826
00:42:06,394 --> 00:42:08,294
You know I never even
touched my ice cream.

827
00:42:09,004 --> 00:42:10,604
Just melted down my arm.

828
00:42:17,664 --> 00:42:19,054
Did you...?

829
00:42:20,194 --> 00:42:21,604
Did you see him again after that?

830
00:42:27,854 --> 00:42:29,054
Yeah.

831
00:42:32,394 --> 00:42:36,224
Alright, that's good,
let's stop there for now.

832
00:42:36,254 --> 00:42:37,254
Sure.

833
00:42:37,494 --> 00:42:40,784
He said he was a way to make me
more comfortable with my body.

834
00:42:42,164 --> 00:42:43,994
So, what happened after that?

835
00:42:44,474 --> 00:42:47,784
He took off his clothes and he
said I've been so depressed,

836
00:42:47,904 --> 00:42:50,084
but maybe you can cheer
me up and give a blowjob.

837
00:42:51,044 --> 00:42:52,334
Classic guy.

838
00:42:54,314 --> 00:42:56,034
- And did you?
- Yeah.

839
00:42:57,514 --> 00:42:58,944
I know what you must
be thinking, like...

840
00:42:58,974 --> 00:43:00,334
why would I ever do that?

841
00:43:00,824 --> 00:43:03,294
With some creepy guy who's 30
years older than me, but...

842
00:43:03,994 --> 00:43:06,714
But you have to understand this
was the first time in my life

843
00:43:06,764 --> 00:43:08,974
that someone told me that
it was okay to be gay.

844
00:43:09,464 --> 00:43:10,764
And it was a priest.

845
00:43:13,034 --> 00:43:14,294
So you had oral sex?

846
00:43:14,414 --> 00:43:16,254
Did you have intercourse?

847
00:43:17,174 --> 00:43:20,054
Yes, not then, but later.

848
00:43:22,574 --> 00:43:23,934
It really messed me up.

849
00:43:25,344 --> 00:43:28,344
I'm sober now, but that, that
was the beginning of it all.

850
00:43:30,954 --> 00:43:32,684
It's very confusing, you know?

851
00:43:33,924 --> 00:43:36,094
To be introduced to sex
like that and then,

852
00:43:36,924 --> 00:43:40,004
and then to be attracted to men.

853
00:43:43,024 --> 00:43:46,084
I'm sorry. I knew I was gonna
do this. Oh I'm sorry.

854
00:43:46,134 --> 00:43:48,504
Don't be sorry. It's
ok Joe, it's ok.

855
00:43:49,364 --> 00:43:51,004
Of course, there is a
Church right there.

856
00:43:51,494 --> 00:43:52,494
And a playground.

857
00:43:53,844 --> 00:43:55,994
Joe, did you ever try
and tell anyone?

858
00:43:56,214 --> 00:43:57,684
Like who, a priest?

859
00:43:59,944 --> 00:44:01,254
Can I use your phone?

860
00:44:01,944 --> 00:44:03,254
Yeah, sure, you know where it is.

861
00:44:04,354 --> 00:44:06,524
You can use my name if you want.

862
00:44:07,224 --> 00:44:08,274
Thanks, Patrick.

863
00:44:09,484 --> 00:44:11,834
Don't thank me, just get
this assholes, will ya?

864
00:44:18,234 --> 00:44:19,764
He's one of the lucky ones.

865
00:44:21,164 --> 00:44:22,604
He is still alive.

866
00:44:31,444 --> 00:44:34,394
- Do you want a cup of tea, Sacha?
- I'm ok Nana. Thanks.

867
00:44:38,284 --> 00:44:39,964
- Hello?
- Hi, Joe, it's Sacha Pfeiffer.

868
00:44:40,254 --> 00:44:42,294
- Hi Sacha, how are you?
- I'm good, thanks.

869
00:44:43,494 --> 00:44:46,034
Listen, Joe, I just want a
follow up on one thing.

870
00:44:46,794 --> 00:44:48,994
You talked to Phil Saviano
about all of this, right?

871
00:44:49,064 --> 00:44:51,404
Yeah, I did, I went to a
couple of SNAP meetings.

872
00:44:51,834 --> 00:44:54,634
And did Phil ever suggest you
to do anything about it?

873
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:57,164
No, the meetings weren't
really about that.

874
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,594
I mean, a couple of them
had gone to a lawyer but.

875
00:44:59,604 --> 00:45:02,124
- I didn't think it was worth it.
- Why not?

876
00:45:02,774 --> 00:45:04,130
There were just so
many forms to fill

877
00:45:04,131 --> 00:45:05,414
out, it was
overwhelming, you know.

878
00:45:05,874 --> 00:45:08,404
And he said he could only get
me a small settlement, so...

879
00:45:08,484 --> 00:45:10,864
- Who said that?
- The lawyer told me that.

880
00:45:11,784 --> 00:45:14,254
So, you did go and see a lawyer?

881
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,644
Yeah, but I didn't end
up using him, so...

882
00:45:17,794 --> 00:45:19,914
I didn't think it was
important, I'm sorry.

883
00:45:20,024 --> 00:45:22,674
- I'm not trying to hide anything.
- No, I know, Joe.

884
00:45:23,324 --> 00:45:25,274
Do you remember his
name? The lawyer?

885
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:28,174
No, but maybe Phil would know?

886
00:45:28,664 --> 00:45:30,864
The guy was on TV a lot
during the Porter case.

887
00:45:31,204 --> 00:45:32,214
He was handsome.

888
00:45:32,904 --> 00:45:36,224
- Was it Eric Macleish?
- Yeah, that's him. Macleish.

889
00:45:36,674 --> 00:45:38,254
I thought he was very handsome.

890
00:45:41,974 --> 00:45:43,464
- Hey.
- Hey.

891
00:45:43,784 --> 00:45:44,784
I was just in a newsroom...

892
00:45:44,814 --> 00:45:46,914
Judge Sweeney set a
date for the hearing.

893
00:45:47,184 --> 00:45:49,984
- Really, when?
- In two weeks, in Springfield.

894
00:45:50,394 --> 00:45:52,834
Canellos started a pool
of 10 bucks to get in.

895
00:45:53,224 --> 00:45:54,364
Anyone picking The Globe?

896
00:45:54,874 --> 00:45:57,664
He's only taking best if how
fast Sweeney rules against us.

897
00:45:59,464 --> 00:46:01,094
- Robby.
- Hi, it's me.

898
00:46:01,164 --> 00:46:02,614
- Did you got my message?
- I did.

899
00:46:02,704 --> 00:46:04,704
Looks like Father Shanley
could be our fourth priest.

900
00:46:04,834 --> 00:46:06,154
Yeah, I think he is.

901
00:46:06,184 --> 00:46:08,154
Did you follow up on Macleish?

902
00:46:08,504 --> 00:46:10,024
I just talked with Phil,
he said Macleish...

903
00:46:10,064 --> 00:46:11,554
dealt with a number of this cases.

904
00:46:11,674 --> 00:46:13,384
I guess he forgot to mention that.

905
00:46:13,385 --> 00:46:14,385
Yeah.

906
00:46:14,484 --> 00:46:16,318
I'm gonna go to the courthouse
tomorrow, see if I can...

907
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,349
find any cases he settled
against the Church.

908
00:46:18,954 --> 00:46:20,344
Alright, call me after you do.

909
00:46:20,624 --> 00:46:22,394
- Good night.
- Ok, good night.

910
00:46:25,494 --> 00:46:26,494
Hey.

911
00:46:27,124 --> 00:46:28,494
You wanted to chat?

912
00:46:28,524 --> 00:46:30,434
Yeah, I'm late for dinner,
you wanna walk me out?

913
00:46:30,494 --> 00:46:31,494
Sure.

914
00:46:32,934 --> 00:46:35,184
Jesus, does this guy ever go home?

915
00:46:35,234 --> 00:46:36,234
Apparently not.

916
00:46:36,974 --> 00:46:38,354
I got guys who won't
leave until he does,

917
00:46:38,374 --> 00:46:40,154
he's wearing out the
goddamn newsroom.

918
00:46:40,904 --> 00:46:42,084
Where are we on Geoghan?

919
00:46:42,604 --> 00:46:44,084
Following up with more victims.

920
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:46,734
Hey I want to expend
the investigation.

921
00:46:46,735 --> 00:46:47,735
Why?

922
00:46:47,736 --> 00:46:50,334
We got fourth priest, it
might be as many as 13.

923
00:46:50,754 --> 00:46:51,974
- 13?
- Yeah.

924
00:46:53,084 --> 00:46:55,024
- Who's your source?
- Phil Saviano.

925
00:46:55,424 --> 00:46:57,053
Oh, Jesus Christ
Robby, I told Mike...

926
00:46:57,054 --> 00:46:58,054
I know, I know.

927
00:46:58,055 --> 00:47:00,174
I know, I think Saviano
might be legit, Ben.

928
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:02,964
You want to elaborate on that?

929
00:47:03,194 --> 00:47:04,964
No, not really.

930
00:47:06,234 --> 00:47:09,004
It just feels like this thing
is stacking up. He's my guy.

931
00:47:12,604 --> 00:47:15,144
- Ok.
- Ok, good, thank you.

932
00:47:25,214 --> 00:47:26,214
Hello?

933
00:47:26,654 --> 00:47:29,494
- Mr Rezendes?
- Yeah, who is this?

934
00:47:29,884 --> 00:47:31,134
It's Richard Sipe.

935
00:47:31,704 --> 00:47:33,504
Oh, yeah, hey
Richard, how are you?

936
00:47:33,564 --> 00:47:34,564
I'm good.

937
00:47:34,624 --> 00:47:35,914
Thanks for calling.

938
00:47:36,094 --> 00:47:38,714
Look... Phil Saviano
gave me your name,

939
00:47:39,034 --> 00:47:41,194
I was wondering if I could
ask you a few questions?

940
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:42,664
- Of course, yeah.
- Great.

941
00:47:43,134 --> 00:47:46,284
So, Phil told me that you
were working at one of...

942
00:47:46,314 --> 00:47:48,474
The Church's treatment
centres in Baltimore?

943
00:47:48,604 --> 00:47:51,654
Yes, the Seton
Psychiatric Institute.

944
00:47:51,774 --> 00:47:53,474
It was run by the
Daughters of Charity.

945
00:47:53,504 --> 00:47:54,544
And...

946
00:47:55,314 --> 00:47:56,394
When was that, Richard?

947
00:47:57,154 --> 00:48:01,054
Well, I started my psychotherapy
fellowship there in 1965.

948
00:48:02,084 --> 00:48:04,764
And I was there for 5 years,
then I spend the next 30...

949
00:48:05,094 --> 00:48:07,644
studying abusive priests
and their victims.

950
00:48:07,674 --> 00:48:08,674
Really?

951
00:48:08,924 --> 00:48:11,144
And that's been your sole focus?

952
00:48:11,694 --> 00:48:14,464
Look Mike, the Church wants
us to believe that...

953
00:48:14,504 --> 00:48:16,284
it's just a few bad apples.

954
00:48:16,314 --> 00:48:18,064
It's much bigger
problem than that.

955
00:48:18,234 --> 00:48:19,424
How much bigger, Richard?

956
00:48:19,454 --> 00:48:21,624
Well, based on the research...

957
00:48:22,104 --> 00:48:23,393
I would classify it as a

958
00:48:23,394 --> 00:48:25,434
recognisable psychiatric
phenomenon.

959
00:48:26,584 --> 00:48:27,654
That's big?

960
00:48:33,424 --> 00:48:34,784
- Hey, Mac.
- Hey.

961
00:48:34,824 --> 00:48:37,054
If I wanted historical
data on a priest,

962
00:48:37,074 --> 00:48:39,764
parishes he'd been assigned
to, where would I find it?

963
00:48:40,054 --> 00:48:41,528
The Geoghan case?
It's all in clips.

964
00:48:41,529 --> 00:48:42,724
Lisa has the source material.

965
00:48:43,024 --> 00:48:44,357
Yeah, what if it was
for another priest?

966
00:48:44,358 --> 00:48:45,658
The one that hadn't
been in the papers.

967
00:48:45,659 --> 00:48:47,979
- Looking at another priest?
- Who're you looking at?

968
00:48:48,864 --> 00:48:49,864
Any ideas?

969
00:48:49,884 --> 00:48:51,934
Come on, Matt. You're
not gonna tell me?

970
00:48:53,174 --> 00:48:54,464
I gotta get to a
meeting. Thanks Mac.

971
00:48:54,554 --> 00:48:55,554
Hey, Steve.

972
00:48:57,514 --> 00:48:59,494
The Archdioceses puts out
the annual directory.

973
00:48:59,514 --> 00:49:00,944
Every priest in parish.

974
00:49:00,984 --> 00:49:04,804
That's great. This go back
any further than '98?

975
00:49:04,884 --> 00:49:06,614
Oh yeah. They go back
to the 80's in the Mez.

976
00:49:06,644 --> 00:49:08,044
Beyond that, you
gotta go to the BPL.

977
00:49:08,724 --> 00:49:10,784
- In the Mez. Thanks, Lisa.
- Bye.

978
00:49:12,494 --> 00:49:14,214
He said they all target
the same kinda kid.

979
00:49:14,824 --> 00:49:17,144
Low income families,
absentee fathers...

980
00:49:17,174 --> 00:49:18,174
broken homes.

981
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:20,095
For guy like Geoghan, goes after

982
00:49:20,096 --> 00:49:21,794
boys, not because
he prefers them...

983
00:49:21,864 --> 00:49:24,524
but because they are more
ashamed, less likely to talk.

984
00:49:26,274 --> 00:49:27,754
And these guys are
predators, Robby.

985
00:49:28,204 --> 00:49:29,204
I talked to Sipe.

986
00:49:29,234 --> 00:49:31,694
Sipe says he saw dozens of
them in the 60's at Seton.

987
00:49:33,684 --> 00:49:35,544
- Why didn't he go public?
- He did.

988
00:49:35,684 --> 00:49:37,774
But the Church made a huge
effort to discredit him.

989
00:49:37,954 --> 00:49:40,924
Smear campaigns. Public
statements by prominent Bishops.

990
00:49:41,724 --> 00:49:44,424
It's just like Saviano
said. And Garabedian.

991
00:49:44,494 --> 00:49:47,004
- You get anywhere with him?
- More victims.

992
00:49:47,624 --> 00:49:48,664
More victims?

993
00:49:48,724 --> 00:49:50,084
You can't empty his pockets?

994
00:49:50,104 --> 00:49:51,464
I'll get him. I just
need more time.

995
00:49:51,934 --> 00:49:53,467
Come on, Mike, you gotta get him.

996
00:49:53,468 --> 00:49:54,744
I'll get him, I'll get him.

997
00:49:58,334 --> 00:49:59,704
Jesus, what the
hell is that smell?

998
00:49:59,774 --> 00:50:01,574
There's a dead rat in the corner.

999
00:50:02,344 --> 00:50:03,584
What have you got?

1000
00:50:03,643 --> 00:50:04,643
Church directories.

1001
00:50:04,644 --> 00:50:06,254
It's every priest
in Massachusetts.

1002
00:50:06,514 --> 00:50:07,854
What parish they were assigned to?

1003
00:50:07,855 --> 00:50:08,855
Is it official?

1004
00:50:08,914 --> 00:50:10,548
Yeah, I figure it would
help us track down some...

1005
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,114
of the priests that
Saviano mentioned.

1006
00:50:12,154 --> 00:50:13,474
Maybe find some more victims.

1007
00:50:13,524 --> 00:50:14,844
Can we turn on some
more light in here?

1008
00:50:14,884 --> 00:50:16,884
I couldn't find the switch. Do
you want to borrow my glasses?

1009
00:50:16,885 --> 00:50:19,465
- No, I'm good, I'm good.
- Look, look 1983.

1010
00:50:19,924 --> 00:50:22,034
John Geoghan, St. Brendan
Parish Dorchester.

1011
00:50:22,594 --> 00:50:23,744
So, so we can find out...

1012
00:50:23,784 --> 00:50:25,244
where any priest is
at any given year?

1013
00:50:25,264 --> 00:50:26,554
Yeah, I got him here.

1014
00:50:29,133 --> 00:50:30,133
What?

1015
00:50:30,134 --> 00:50:32,454
1980, the year Geoghan
was pulled from JP.

1016
00:50:32,474 --> 00:50:33,804
It says he's on sick leave.

1017
00:50:33,874 --> 00:50:35,424
Come on, it really says that?

1018
00:50:37,214 --> 00:50:39,644
Where is 1991?

1019
00:50:39,974 --> 00:50:42,574
- Yeah, here.
- Let's see this.

1020
00:50:42,584 --> 00:50:44,321
Barrett, Barrett,
Liam. I can't read

1021
00:50:44,322 --> 00:50:45,964
this, look for Liam Barrett there.

1022
00:50:46,554 --> 00:50:49,504
1991's the year they pulled
him out of Charlestown.

1023
00:50:51,654 --> 00:50:52,654
Barrett, Liam?

1024
00:50:53,824 --> 00:50:54,824
Yeah.

1025
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:56,094
Sick leave.

1026
00:50:56,934 --> 00:50:58,504
That's an official designation.

1027
00:51:00,564 --> 00:51:01,884
Get this upstairs.

1028
00:51:02,604 --> 00:51:03,604
And Matt, check...

1029
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:05,324
the priests Saviano
gave us. Robby.

1030
00:51:05,704 --> 00:51:07,194
- I'm at the Court House.
- Yeah.

1031
00:51:07,944 --> 00:51:09,094
Something's not right here.

1032
00:51:09,134 --> 00:51:10,954
Nothing on Shanley either, Sacha.

1033
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,124
Ok, thanks.

1034
00:51:12,834 --> 00:51:14,604
Yeah, we need to go
talk to Macleish again.

1035
00:51:14,634 --> 00:51:15,634
Really? Why?

1036
00:51:15,984 --> 00:51:17,254
There's nothing here.

1037
00:51:17,494 --> 00:51:19,254
There aren't any records...

1038
00:51:24,394 --> 00:51:26,944
Thanks for waiting, so sorry
guys. Stuck in a call.

1039
00:51:26,994 --> 00:51:28,654
- Not a problem, how are you?
- Good.

1040
00:51:28,694 --> 00:51:31,214
- Thanks for meeting us.
- You bet. What's up guys?

1041
00:51:31,534 --> 00:51:33,194
Mr Macleish, are you familiar with

1042
00:51:33,195 --> 00:51:34,624
the priest named Paul Shinley?

1043
00:51:35,234 --> 00:51:36,654
Yes, I am familiar with him.

1044
00:51:38,774 --> 00:51:40,754
And have you settled cases
against Father Shinley?

1045
00:51:41,904 --> 00:51:44,814
As I'm sure you can
understand, I can't...

1046
00:51:44,844 --> 00:51:46,454
discuss that with you.

1047
00:51:46,914 --> 00:51:50,474
Yeah, how about
Father Ronald Paquin?

1048
00:51:51,014 --> 00:51:53,554
Well, I can't discuss that with
you either. Come on, guys.

1049
00:51:55,684 --> 00:51:57,204
We understand you've
settled several

1050
00:51:57,205 --> 00:51:58,354
cases against each of them.

1051
00:51:58,654 --> 00:52:01,314
Even if I'd been
involved in those cases,

1052
00:52:01,364 --> 00:52:03,454
the settlements would
be confidential.

1053
00:52:03,494 --> 00:52:06,134
And I can be disbarred for
acknowledging their existence.

1054
00:52:06,964 --> 00:52:07,964
Ok?

1055
00:52:09,004 --> 00:52:11,094
Look, I told you guys,
these are tough cases.

1056
00:52:12,634 --> 00:52:15,784
Most of these folks, they just
want some acknowledgement...

1057
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:17,624
of what happened.

1058
00:52:17,674 --> 00:52:19,544
We got them a sit-down
with the bishop and

1059
00:52:19,554 --> 00:52:21,954
a little dough, and that's
the best they can hope for.

1060
00:52:22,484 --> 00:52:26,464
Well, certainly the best
the priest could hope for.

1061
00:52:27,624 --> 00:52:28,758
No, the Church promises to take...

1062
00:52:28,759 --> 00:52:30,319
the priest out of circulation.

1063
00:52:30,854 --> 00:52:32,384
And did you follow up on that?

1064
00:52:38,234 --> 00:52:40,634
- You guys need anything else?
- Yes.

1065
00:52:41,064 --> 00:52:42,524
Why aren't there any records?

1066
00:52:42,724 --> 00:52:44,214
I was down at the
Court House earlier,

1067
00:52:44,254 --> 00:52:46,534
there aren't any records of
any of these settlements.

1068
00:52:49,344 --> 00:52:51,594
We dealt directly with the Church.

1069
00:52:52,914 --> 00:52:56,274
We'd draw up a demand letter and
we'd send it to the chancery.

1070
00:52:57,654 --> 00:52:59,274
You never filed anything in Court?

1071
00:52:59,654 --> 00:53:02,414
- It's a private mediation.
- So...

1072
00:53:02,684 --> 00:53:05,514
this is just you and the
Archdiocese lawyers...

1073
00:53:06,744 --> 00:53:09,414
- In a room?
- Correct.

1074
00:53:10,324 --> 00:53:11,324
Anyone else?

1075
00:53:11,834 --> 00:53:13,460
Occasionally the
Church would bring in

1076
00:53:13,461 --> 00:53:15,044
another defence
attorney to help out.

1077
00:53:15,664 --> 00:53:18,314
- You know names?
- No.

1078
00:53:19,174 --> 00:53:20,454
No I don't.

1079
00:53:21,404 --> 00:53:22,944
So this was all under the table.

1080
00:53:22,974 --> 00:53:24,534
There's no paper trail, at all.

1081
00:53:25,044 --> 00:53:26,511
The victim has to sign
the confidentiality...

1082
00:53:26,512 --> 00:53:28,252
agreement to get the settlement.

1083
00:53:28,344 --> 00:53:29,934
The lawyer takes his third and...

1084
00:53:29,964 --> 00:53:31,174
the Church sweeps
it under the rug.

1085
00:53:31,224 --> 00:53:32,304
Jesus, that's freaking racket.

1086
00:53:32,414 --> 00:53:33,824
It's more complicated than that.

1087
00:53:34,154 --> 00:53:35,803
Macleish has got the
duty to client...

1088
00:53:35,804 --> 00:53:36,974
to get the best deal he can.

1089
00:53:37,194 --> 00:53:38,874
Sure, but how many victims...

1090
00:53:38,884 --> 00:53:41,454
do you represent and profit
from, before you say something?

1091
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:42,934
Garabedian would say none.

1092
00:53:43,724 --> 00:53:45,714
And that's why he's taking
these cases to Court.

1093
00:53:45,734 --> 00:53:47,304
Because he wants people
to know about this.

1094
00:53:47,334 --> 00:53:48,334
I agree.

1095
00:53:48,534 --> 00:53:50,584
And legal ethics
aside, Ben, I mean...

1096
00:53:50,874 --> 00:53:52,324
operating the way Macleish has,

1097
00:53:52,364 --> 00:53:54,584
all the guarantee is that
abuse stays under wraps.

1098
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:58,864
Yeah, did Macleish confirm
all Saviano's priests?

1099
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,294
No, he is...

1100
00:54:00,344 --> 00:54:03,384
limited by his
confidentiality agreement.

1101
00:54:03,714 --> 00:54:06,084
But clearly he settles cases
against a number of them.

1102
00:54:06,384 --> 00:54:08,704
Phil's put me in touch with
some of the other victims,

1103
00:54:08,804 --> 00:54:11,154
I'm pretty confident all of his
priests are going to check out.

1104
00:54:11,994 --> 00:54:14,344
- So there's 13 priests?
- Yeah.

1105
00:54:14,364 --> 00:54:15,554
Looks that way.

1106
00:54:17,364 --> 00:54:18,404
Holy shit.

1107
00:54:21,264 --> 00:54:23,124
Ok, keep going.

1108
00:54:24,554 --> 00:54:26,314
CATHOLIC CHARITIES GALA Guest List

1109
00:54:26,574 --> 00:54:28,814
I'm sorry, what was
the name again?

1110
00:54:30,074 --> 00:54:31,094
Baron.

1111
00:54:32,574 --> 00:54:34,814
B-A-L-U-N B-A-R-O-N.

1112
00:54:35,884 --> 00:54:38,804
I'm having trouble finding
it, just give me a second.

1113
00:54:39,154 --> 00:54:40,914
It's ok Kim, I can vouch for him.

1114
00:54:41,554 --> 00:54:43,944
I'm Pete Conley, I'm on the
Board of Catholic Charities.

1115
00:54:44,294 --> 00:54:46,094
Welcome to Boston, Mr Baron.

1116
00:54:46,594 --> 00:54:48,294
- Thank you.
- Appreciate you joining us.

1117
00:54:49,164 --> 00:54:51,644
We're very proud of the
work we do here at Boston.

1118
00:54:52,564 --> 00:54:54,604
Oh, the Cardinal said
you had a nice visit.

1119
00:54:55,234 --> 00:54:57,674
- Yes. We did.
- He's an extraordinary man.

1120
00:54:58,234 --> 00:55:00,124
I'm glad you had a chance to chat.

1121
00:55:14,024 --> 00:55:15,294
Enjoying yourself?

1122
00:55:17,554 --> 00:55:20,524
To be honest, these events
aren't really my strong suit.

1123
00:55:20,804 --> 00:55:21,804
Yeah.

1124
00:55:21,805 --> 00:55:23,424
Are you involved with The Charity?

1125
00:55:23,824 --> 00:55:25,344
Not directly, no.

1126
00:55:25,394 --> 00:55:26,844
Some of my friends
are, we all went to...

1127
00:55:27,054 --> 00:55:29,454
high school, BC High, that's a...

1128
00:55:30,064 --> 00:55:31,784
school across the
street from The Globe.

1129
00:55:31,814 --> 00:55:33,504
- It's hard to miss.
- Yeah.

1130
00:55:34,474 --> 00:55:36,174
Hard to get away from
too, apparently.

1131
00:55:39,014 --> 00:55:43,504
The Cardinal is in the corner,
if you're so inclined.

1132
00:55:43,544 --> 00:55:45,334
- We've met.
- Really?

1133
00:55:45,684 --> 00:55:47,374
Did he mentioned the suit?

1134
00:55:47,824 --> 00:55:50,534
No, but he did give me
a copy of cathecism.

1135
00:55:51,454 --> 00:55:54,294
Yeah, well, the Cardinal is
not known for his subtlety.

1136
00:55:54,724 --> 00:55:57,054
During the Porter investigation,
he'd literally...

1137
00:55:57,134 --> 00:55:59,394
call down the power
of God on the Globe.

1138
00:56:00,034 --> 00:56:01,424
How that got out?

1139
00:56:02,604 --> 00:56:05,464
A week later our editor
broke his leg skiing.

1140
00:56:06,934 --> 00:56:08,634
Shrimp toast, gentlemen?

1141
00:56:09,004 --> 00:56:10,994
No, thanks. Thanks.

1142
00:56:12,474 --> 00:56:14,254
You said there was
a victim who filed

1143
00:56:14,284 --> 00:56:15,564
a criminal complaint?

1144
00:56:16,184 --> 00:56:17,624
Yeah, there were a few of them.

1145
00:56:19,314 --> 00:56:20,764
But the Judge had the
case reconciled...

1146
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:23,194
after friends of the
Church complained.

1147
00:56:23,524 --> 00:56:24,994
And the Church has
a lot of friends.

1148
00:56:25,224 --> 00:56:26,244
Like Eric Macleish?

1149
00:56:27,964 --> 00:56:30,474
Yeah. Let's just say...

1150
00:56:31,234 --> 00:56:32,414
he is not part of the solution.

1151
00:56:32,464 --> 00:56:34,434
- You follow what I'm saying.
- Sure.

1152
00:56:35,264 --> 00:56:36,534
You work hard Mr Rezendes.

1153
00:56:36,604 --> 00:56:37,724
Are you married?

1154
00:56:38,873 --> 00:56:39,873
Yeah.

1155
00:56:39,874 --> 00:56:41,574
And your wife doesn't mind
you working all the time?

1156
00:56:41,704 --> 00:56:42,784
Yeah, she does.

1157
00:56:45,214 --> 00:56:46,374
That's why I never got married.

1158
00:56:47,214 --> 00:56:48,304
To busy.

1159
00:56:48,784 --> 00:56:50,424
What I do is to important.

1160
00:56:54,824 --> 00:56:56,534
Your new editor, he's a Jew right?

1161
00:56:57,994 --> 00:56:59,904
- That's right, yeah.
- Well, see...

1162
00:57:00,494 --> 00:57:01,844
He comes in,

1163
00:57:01,864 --> 00:57:03,794
and suddenly everybody is
interested in the Church.

1164
00:57:03,864 --> 00:57:05,734
- You know why?
- No.

1165
00:57:05,864 --> 00:57:07,734
Because it takes the outsider.

1166
00:57:08,104 --> 00:57:10,584
Like me. I'm Armenian.

1167
00:57:11,374 --> 00:57:13,304
How many Armenians do
you know in Boston?

1168
00:57:14,444 --> 00:57:16,204
Steve Kurkjian,
works at The Globe.

1169
00:57:16,904 --> 00:57:20,134
That's two. You should get
a prize or something.

1170
00:57:20,984 --> 00:57:23,504
- What are you, Italian?
- No, I'm Portuguese.

1171
00:57:24,554 --> 00:57:27,134
- From where?
- East Boston.

1172
00:57:28,624 --> 00:57:30,714
Really? East Boston?

1173
00:57:32,594 --> 00:57:33,894
You don't sound like it.

1174
00:57:40,364 --> 00:57:41,574
This city.

1175
00:57:42,264 --> 00:57:43,374
This people.

1176
00:57:44,934 --> 00:57:47,094
Making the rest of us feel
like we don't belong.

1177
00:57:48,104 --> 00:57:49,424
But they're no better than us.

1178
00:57:50,004 --> 00:57:51,764
Look at how they treat
their children.

1179
00:57:54,144 --> 00:57:56,094
Mark my words Mr Rezendes,

1180
00:57:56,384 --> 00:57:58,144
if it takes a village
to raise a child,

1181
00:57:58,454 --> 00:58:00,234
it takes a village to abuse one.

1182
00:58:04,824 --> 00:58:06,394
- Hey, there he is.
- Hey.

1183
00:58:06,454 --> 00:58:08,014
- You want a beer?
- Love one.

1184
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:11,664
- Another. You with Barbara?
- No, no.

1185
00:58:11,964 --> 00:58:14,414
- She hates this things.
- Karen too.

1186
00:58:14,444 --> 00:58:15,634
- Yeah.
- Smart ladies.

1187
00:58:20,034 --> 00:58:21,204
I met your new editor.

1188
00:58:22,444 --> 00:58:24,774
- Seems like a decent fella.
- I think he is.

1189
00:58:27,714 --> 00:58:29,749
Hey, I had an interesting
conversation

1190
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:31,314
with Eric MacLeish yesterday.

1191
00:58:31,924 --> 00:58:34,454
Turns out he's been
settling abuse cases...

1192
00:58:34,464 --> 00:58:36,664
with the Archdioceses for years.

1193
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:40,154
You want to talk about this here?

1194
00:58:40,524 --> 00:58:43,184
Jim, You said you helped out

1195
00:58:43,224 --> 00:58:45,784
on Father Barrett as a favour,

1196
00:58:46,404 --> 00:58:47,774
that was a one-off?

1197
00:58:51,374 --> 00:58:53,804
How many of these cases
you've been involved with?

1198
00:58:54,944 --> 00:58:57,884
You know I can't answer
that Robby, it's unethical.

1199
00:58:59,084 --> 00:59:00,304
Is that all it is?

1200
00:59:02,984 --> 00:59:05,494
So, this...

1201
00:59:05,984 --> 00:59:07,754
would be the Robby
Robinson I've always

1202
00:59:07,764 --> 00:59:09,514
heard about, but never met.

1203
00:59:11,124 --> 00:59:12,414
Listen, Jimmy.

1204
00:59:13,464 --> 00:59:15,464
You want to be on the
right side of this.

1205
00:59:17,734 --> 00:59:20,814
This is the Church, you're
talking about Robby.

1206
00:59:20,824 --> 00:59:22,514
Look around, these
are good people,

1207
00:59:22,544 --> 00:59:24,404
done a lot of good for this city.

1208
00:59:25,874 --> 00:59:27,224
Enjoy the party.

1209
00:59:36,384 --> 00:59:37,854
I've been through a lot these now.

1210
00:59:38,124 --> 00:59:40,074
"Sick leave" isn't the
only designation...

1211
00:59:40,104 --> 00:59:41,214
they use when they take one...

1212
00:59:41,224 --> 00:59:42,524
of these priests out
of the circulation.

1213
00:59:42,525 --> 00:59:44,865
They use slew of terms
'absent on leave',

1214
00:59:45,024 --> 00:59:47,754
'unassigned',
'emergency response.'

1215
00:59:47,774 --> 00:59:49,432
They work for
everything, these guys.

1216
00:59:49,433 --> 00:59:50,433
Except rape.

1217
00:59:50,434 --> 00:59:51,553
And they move parishes...

1218
00:59:51,554 --> 00:59:53,314
way more frequently
than other priests.

1219
00:59:53,334 --> 00:59:55,544
When I was a kid, priest moved
after seven or eight years.

1220
00:59:55,574 --> 00:59:56,574
Sometimes longer.

1221
00:59:56,575 --> 00:59:58,234
These guys, it's 2
to 3 years tops.

1222
00:59:58,574 --> 00:59:59,744
And did they use
this designations.

1223
00:59:59,784 --> 01:00:01,564
- For all Saviano's priests?
- Yeah.

1224
01:00:01,914 --> 01:00:04,684
- It's pretty clear pattern.
- Guys, I got Sipe.

1225
01:00:05,314 --> 01:00:08,394
I think that if you really want
to understand the crisis...

1226
01:00:08,484 --> 01:00:11,004
you need to start with the
celibacy requirement.

1227
01:00:11,054 --> 01:00:12,784
That was my first major finding.

1228
01:00:13,154 --> 01:00:15,764
Only 50% of the
clergy are celibate.

1229
01:00:16,854 --> 01:00:19,704
Now, most of them are having
sex with other adults.

1230
01:00:20,264 --> 01:00:22,193
But the fact remains
that this creates...

1231
01:00:22,194 --> 01:00:24,964
a culture of secrecy that
tolerates and even protects...

1232
01:00:24,994 --> 01:00:26,254
paedophiles.

1233
01:00:27,474 --> 01:00:29,074
So you believe the
Church is aware...

1234
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:31,334
Of the extent of this 'crisis?

1235
01:00:31,344 --> 01:00:32,704
Well, absolutely.

1236
01:00:32,804 --> 01:00:34,764
After the first major
scandal in Louisiana,

1237
01:00:34,774 --> 01:00:38,234
Tom Doyle, the Secretary
Canonist for papal nuncio,

1238
01:00:38,264 --> 01:00:39,674
co-authored a report...

1239
01:00:39,704 --> 01:00:41,084
warning paedophile priests,

1240
01:00:41,124 --> 01:00:43,074
were billion-dollar liability.

1241
01:00:43,554 --> 01:00:44,804
That was in 1985.

1242
01:00:45,454 --> 01:00:47,344
- 1985?
- That's right.

1243
01:00:48,294 --> 01:00:50,974
Who saw that report, anyone
from the catholic hierarchy?

1244
01:00:51,194 --> 01:00:52,384
Sure.

1245
01:00:52,694 --> 01:00:54,363
Doyle tried to introduce
the report...

1246
01:00:54,364 --> 01:00:56,494
at the National Conference
of Catholic Bishops.

1247
01:00:56,534 --> 01:01:00,314
In fact, Cardinal Law initially
helped to fund the report,

1248
01:01:00,604 --> 01:01:02,784
but then he backed out
and they shelved it.

1249
01:01:03,004 --> 01:01:04,674
- Are you kidding me?
- Oh, Richard.

1250
01:01:04,704 --> 01:01:06,314
Robby here.

1251
01:01:06,644 --> 01:01:09,454
We think we have 13 priests...

1252
01:01:09,474 --> 01:01:11,834
in Boston that fits
this pattern, which...

1253
01:01:12,284 --> 01:01:15,004
would be a very, very big story.

1254
01:01:15,034 --> 01:01:16,804
Does that sound right to you?

1255
01:01:16,984 --> 01:01:18,964
In terms of scale?

1256
01:01:19,284 --> 01:01:20,654
No, not really, Robby.

1257
01:01:20,854 --> 01:01:22,274
Sounds low to me.

1258
01:01:22,924 --> 01:01:26,224
My estimate suggests six percent
act out sexually with minors.

1259
01:01:27,124 --> 01:01:29,114
Six percent of what?

1260
01:01:29,734 --> 01:01:31,414
Six percent of all priests.

1261
01:01:32,034 --> 01:01:33,784
How many priest do
we have in Boston?

1262
01:01:34,064 --> 01:01:37,114
About fifteen hundred. One percent
is fifteen... six percent is...

1263
01:01:38,344 --> 01:01:39,344
ninety.

1264
01:01:40,654 --> 01:01:44,334
- 90 priests.
- Is that possible?

1265
01:01:44,684 --> 01:01:46,524
From a metric standpoint.

1266
01:01:46,984 --> 01:01:51,084
Yes. That would be in
line with my findings.

1267
01:01:57,094 --> 01:01:58,094
Hello?

1268
01:02:00,794 --> 01:02:02,944
90 fucking priests? In Boston?

1269
01:02:03,534 --> 01:02:04,574
That's what he said.

1270
01:02:05,934 --> 01:02:08,414
If there were 90 of these
bastards, people would know.

1271
01:02:08,573 --> 01:02:09,573
Maybe they do.

1272
01:02:09,574 --> 01:02:11,284
And no one said a thing?

1273
01:02:12,104 --> 01:02:13,424
Good Germans.

1274
01:02:14,274 --> 01:02:16,594
I don't think that's a comparison
you want to make publicly.

1275
01:02:16,874 --> 01:02:18,214
Macleish knew.

1276
01:02:18,544 --> 01:02:21,144
- He just didn't say anything.
- That's 13 priests.

1277
01:02:21,414 --> 01:02:23,634
There's a big difference
between 13 and 90...

1278
01:02:23,654 --> 01:02:25,344
Where's this Sipe guy
getting his numbers?

1279
01:02:25,364 --> 01:02:27,374
Well, he's been studying
it for 30 years...

1280
01:02:27,404 --> 01:02:29,224
He is a trained psychotherapist.

1281
01:02:29,254 --> 01:02:31,614
Ok, but we need something more
than a metric from some...

1282
01:02:31,644 --> 01:02:34,264
some hippy ex-priest who's
shacking up with a nun.

1283
01:02:34,304 --> 01:02:36,884
Ok so, we'll track
down more victims.

1284
01:02:36,894 --> 01:02:38,154
We'll get more priests, then...

1285
01:02:38,174 --> 01:02:40,314
then we could, we could check
them against the directories.

1286
01:02:40,344 --> 01:02:42,854
- That's a shitload of victims.
- We'll get there.

1287
01:02:43,574 --> 01:02:44,824
How long is it going to take?

1288
01:02:46,044 --> 01:02:47,214
Too long.

1289
01:02:48,874 --> 01:02:51,644
- Wait, what, the meeting is over?
- Yeah, for now.

1290
01:02:53,944 --> 01:02:56,424
- What do you got?
- What if we work backwards?

1291
01:02:56,954 --> 01:02:58,074
What do you mean? From what?

1292
01:02:58,083 --> 01:02:59,083
From the directories.

1293
01:02:59,084 --> 01:03:01,004
We've been using them
to confirm bad priests.

1294
01:03:01,034 --> 01:03:02,584
What if we do it the
other way around.

1295
01:03:02,604 --> 01:03:04,144
Use the directories to
identify bad priests?

1296
01:03:04,163 --> 01:03:05,163
Yeah, exactly.

1297
01:03:05,164 --> 01:03:06,594
We search by designation.

1298
01:03:06,604 --> 01:03:08,084
You know, we look
for any priest...

1299
01:03:08,124 --> 01:03:09,534
on a sick leave or unassigned.

1300
01:03:09,553 --> 01:03:10,853
Or for priests who
moved around a lot...

1301
01:03:10,854 --> 01:03:11,854
Yeah.

1302
01:03:11,855 --> 01:03:13,043
Which can take a load of work.

1303
01:03:13,044 --> 01:03:14,854
Well, not if we're all on it.

1304
01:03:15,234 --> 01:03:16,234
You too?

1305
01:03:16,354 --> 01:03:18,614
Generally, that's
what all means, yeah.

1306
01:03:18,634 --> 01:03:19,784
Yeah, generally.

1307
01:03:21,914 --> 01:03:22,914
Sick Leave.

1308
01:03:27,914 --> 01:03:29,264
Unassigned.

1309
01:03:50,934 --> 01:03:52,154
Unassigned.

1310
01:03:53,754 --> 01:03:54,994
Active.

1311
01:04:13,394 --> 01:04:15,374
Library is closing.

1312
01:04:18,064 --> 01:04:19,954
Library is closing.

1313
01:04:26,644 --> 01:04:28,784
O 'Sullivan, Eugene
M. Treatment Centre.

1314
01:04:29,444 --> 01:04:30,604
Oh shit.

1315
01:05:18,324 --> 01:05:19,784
No freaking way.

1316
01:05:24,004 --> 01:05:26,654
KIDS. Stay away from this
house at 276 Pelton Street.

1317
01:05:26,754 --> 01:05:28,824
And stay away from the
men who live inside it.

1318
01:05:29,054 --> 01:05:30,094
- Talbot?
- Yeah.

1319
01:05:30,374 --> 01:05:31,374
- Tivnan?
- Yeah.

1320
01:05:31,744 --> 01:05:32,744
- Toma?
- Yeah.

1321
01:05:32,874 --> 01:05:33,874
- Turnbull?
- Yeah.

1322
01:05:34,344 --> 01:05:35,654
- Walsh?
- Yeah.

1323
01:05:35,674 --> 01:05:36,894
- Welsh?
- Yeah.

1324
01:05:37,174 --> 01:05:38,334
- Is that it?
- That's it.

1325
01:05:38,514 --> 01:05:40,044
Holy shit. Robby?

1326
01:05:40,114 --> 01:05:42,144
That's three off Sipe's
estimate. That's incredible.

1327
01:05:42,174 --> 01:05:43,174
Robby.

1328
01:05:43,584 --> 01:05:45,164
- How many?
- 87.

1329
01:05:45,184 --> 01:05:46,804
87 priests in Boston.

1330
01:05:49,594 --> 01:05:52,034
Call Macleish. I
want to talk to him.

1331
01:05:52,054 --> 01:05:53,054
Ok.

1332
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:55,234
Can you print it?

1333
01:05:55,324 --> 01:05:56,324
Sure I can.

1334
01:05:58,764 --> 01:06:00,194
Jim Sullivan's office.

1335
01:06:00,234 --> 01:06:02,574
Yeah, Walter Robinson
for Jim Sullivan.

1336
01:06:02,604 --> 01:06:04,434
Tell him it's important, please.

1337
01:06:04,464 --> 01:06:05,594
One moment please.

1338
01:06:10,744 --> 01:06:12,164
Hey, Robby, everything ok?

1339
01:06:12,194 --> 01:06:14,264
I need you to tell
me something, Jim.

1340
01:06:14,584 --> 01:06:17,474
- Could it be 90 priests?
- What?

1341
01:06:17,494 --> 01:06:19,744
Could it be as high as 90?

1342
01:06:19,774 --> 01:06:20,934
Jesus, Robby.

1343
01:06:21,154 --> 01:06:22,374
I need to know, Jim.

1344
01:06:22,414 --> 01:06:24,644
I wouldn't be asking if
it wasn't important.

1345
01:06:26,764 --> 01:06:28,304
You're gonna stop this, Robby.

1346
01:06:36,704 --> 01:06:38,383
Robby, Macleish's assistant...

1347
01:06:38,384 --> 01:06:40,254
said he's all booked
up, he can't see us.

1348
01:06:40,704 --> 01:06:42,864
Yeah, well, the hell he can't.

1349
01:06:48,354 --> 01:06:49,784
Alright, it'll be fine.

1350
01:06:54,224 --> 01:06:56,009
You know what, I'll catch
up with you, okay?

1351
01:06:56,010 --> 01:06:57,010
Ok.

1352
01:06:57,394 --> 01:07:00,223
Hey guys, I'm really sorry,
I am, I don't have any...

1353
01:07:00,224 --> 01:07:01,224
time to talk right now but...

1354
01:07:01,274 --> 01:07:02,675
- Mr Macleish.
- If you call my assistant.

1355
01:07:02,695 --> 01:07:04,129
We have reasons to believe
that there are...

1356
01:07:04,130 --> 01:07:06,389
allegations against as many
as 87 priests in Boston.

1357
01:07:06,964 --> 01:07:08,484
I can't talk to you about that.

1358
01:07:08,774 --> 01:07:10,144
Does that number
sound right to you?

1359
01:07:10,174 --> 01:07:11,575
You gotta be kidding
me, I just told you...

1360
01:07:11,615 --> 01:07:12,975
I don't have time for this crap.

1361
01:07:12,995 --> 01:07:14,814
Eric, how many priests
did you settle?

1362
01:07:16,114 --> 01:07:17,704
Robby, you know I
can't tell you that.

1363
01:07:17,884 --> 01:07:19,118
You're going to give
me their names...

1364
01:07:19,184 --> 01:07:20,674
and the names of their victims.

1365
01:07:22,954 --> 01:07:24,234
Are you threatening me?

1366
01:07:24,954 --> 01:07:26,234
We've got two stories here.

1367
01:07:26,424 --> 01:07:28,464
We got a story about
degenerate clergy.

1368
01:07:28,594 --> 01:07:30,664
And we got a story about
a bunch of lawyers...

1369
01:07:30,694 --> 01:07:33,304
turning child abuse into
a cottage industry.

1370
01:07:33,624 --> 01:07:35,934
Now, which story do
you want us to write?

1371
01:07:35,964 --> 01:07:37,874
Cause we're writing one of them.

1372
01:07:41,374 --> 01:07:43,954
I already sent you
a list of names.

1373
01:07:45,274 --> 01:07:46,924
What are you talking
about? To whom?

1374
01:07:47,304 --> 01:07:49,464
The Globe, years ago.

1375
01:07:49,974 --> 01:07:52,113
After the Porter case I
got plenty of calls.

1376
01:07:52,114 --> 01:07:53,264
I had 20 priests...

1377
01:07:53,284 --> 01:07:54,413
in Boston alone.

1378
01:07:54,414 --> 01:07:56,414
But I couldn't go after
them without the press.

1379
01:07:56,444 --> 01:07:58,234
So I sent you guys...

1380
01:07:58,254 --> 01:08:00,864
a list of names and you buried it.

1381
01:08:03,154 --> 01:08:04,373
I want those names tomorrow.

1382
01:08:04,374 --> 01:08:06,374
Check you goddamn clips, Robby.

1383
01:08:08,964 --> 01:08:11,216
We didn't find
anything in the clips.

1384
01:08:11,217 --> 01:08:12,454
Yeah, big surprise.

1385
01:08:14,034 --> 01:08:15,564
Richard.

1386
01:08:16,174 --> 01:08:17,764
Do you still go to mass?

1387
01:08:18,104 --> 01:08:20,534
No, I haven't been to
Church for some time now.

1388
01:08:20,744 --> 01:08:22,754
But I still consider
myself a catholic.

1389
01:08:23,314 --> 01:08:24,604
How does that work?

1390
01:08:25,214 --> 01:08:27,564
Well, the Church is
an institution, Mike,

1391
01:08:27,964 --> 01:08:29,064
made of men.

1392
01:08:29,454 --> 01:08:32,974
It's passing. My faith
is in the eternal.

1393
01:08:33,854 --> 01:08:35,284
I try to separate the two.

1394
01:08:36,054 --> 01:08:37,284
Sounds tricky.

1395
01:08:37,694 --> 01:08:39,233
It is. Especially...

1396
01:08:39,234 --> 01:08:41,454
since the Church continues
to go after me.

1397
01:08:41,834 --> 01:08:43,484
It takes the toll, Mike.

1398
01:08:44,264 --> 01:08:45,964
They'll try to silence
anyone who speaks out.

1399
01:08:46,004 --> 01:08:48,444
And I'm sure they'll come after
you and your team soon enough.

1400
01:08:48,504 --> 01:08:50,744
Really? And how do you
think they'll do that?

1401
01:08:54,644 --> 01:08:57,174
Hello? Richard?

1402
01:09:03,699 --> 01:09:04,699
Who is it?

1403
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:06,934
It's the Archbishop of Canterbury.

1404
01:09:10,994 --> 01:09:13,104
I had dinner at Santarpio's,
had some leftovers.

1405
01:09:13,134 --> 01:09:14,354
You're the freaking best.

1406
01:09:15,094 --> 01:09:16,744
Thanks. You want a beer?

1407
01:09:17,134 --> 01:09:19,114
- Yeah.
- You got it.

1408
01:09:19,704 --> 01:09:22,104
Jesus. How much longer...

1409
01:09:22,124 --> 01:09:23,294
you're gonna be in this shithole?

1410
01:09:23,314 --> 01:09:24,834
Yeah, I'm working on it.

1411
01:09:25,804 --> 01:09:28,124
- She's a good girl, Mike.
- Yeah, she is.

1412
01:09:28,614 --> 01:09:31,814
We'll figure it out. I haven't
had a lot of time lately.

1413
01:09:32,814 --> 01:09:34,774
I just got off the phone
with Sipe, actually.

1414
01:09:35,454 --> 01:09:37,174
Have you met this
guy in person yet?

1415
01:09:37,654 --> 01:09:40,264
No, but his knowledge on this
is on a whole other level.

1416
01:09:41,054 --> 01:09:42,134
I'm freaking starving.

1417
01:09:43,454 --> 01:09:46,104
So, where are we with the 90?

1418
01:09:46,994 --> 01:09:48,904
- I'm close.
- How close?

1419
01:09:49,213 --> 01:09:50,213
I'm close.

1420
01:09:50,214 --> 01:09:51,844
Just answer the question, will ya?

1421
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:56,744
We got 87 names.

1422
01:09:57,604 --> 01:09:59,684
We're trying to get
confirmation, I think we will.

1423
01:10:02,244 --> 01:10:03,624
Something bugging you?

1424
01:10:04,374 --> 01:10:06,074
It's just surprise, that's all.

1425
01:10:06,914 --> 01:10:09,004
Yeah, yeah it is.

1426
01:10:09,654 --> 01:10:10,654
For everybody.

1427
01:10:15,794 --> 01:10:18,434
Hey, Ben, I forgot to ask you.

1428
01:10:18,864 --> 01:10:20,934
Hey Phil Saviano said
he sent a bunch of...

1429
01:10:20,944 --> 01:10:23,604
info over to The Globe a years
ago, do you have an idea to whom?

1430
01:10:24,064 --> 01:10:26,994
- No, why?
- Well, I'm just curious.

1431
01:10:27,004 --> 01:10:29,104
I wanted to see if there were any
leads you guys didn't run out.

1432
01:10:29,404 --> 01:10:31,143
Saviano was a fucking
train wreck...

1433
01:10:31,144 --> 01:10:32,894
5 years ago, but we
didn't miss anything.

1434
01:10:33,144 --> 01:10:34,764
This story needs Spotlight.

1435
01:10:36,224 --> 01:10:38,274
Yeah, I agree. I'm
just following up.

1436
01:10:41,184 --> 01:10:42,974
- Good night.
- Yeah, good night.

1437
01:10:47,754 --> 01:10:48,874
This is unbelievable.

1438
01:10:49,104 --> 01:10:50,474
When did you get this?

1439
01:10:50,494 --> 01:10:52,324
Macleish emailed the
list this morning.

1440
01:10:52,594 --> 01:10:55,004
He settled cases
against 45 priests.

1441
01:10:55,904 --> 01:10:57,194
Where are we on Law?

1442
01:10:57,484 --> 01:10:59,714
Anything that shows the
acknowledge of this.

1443
01:10:59,764 --> 01:11:02,404
- Still working Garabedian.
- But nothing concrete.

1444
01:11:02,574 --> 01:11:03,577
I keep thinking about that

1445
01:11:03,578 --> 01:11:05,043
conversation we had
the other night,

1446
01:11:05,044 --> 01:11:07,274
about how Law called
down the power of God.

1447
01:11:07,294 --> 01:11:09,644
When we reported the Porter.

1448
01:11:10,074 --> 01:11:11,554
That's just Law being Law.

1449
01:11:11,744 --> 01:11:13,884
Ok, but I checked the clips...

1450
01:11:13,914 --> 01:11:16,174
And Porter isn't even...

1451
01:11:16,204 --> 01:11:18,334
in Boston Archdiocese,
he's from Fall River.

1452
01:11:18,374 --> 01:11:19,374
So...

1453
01:11:20,124 --> 01:11:22,164
Why the extreme reaction?

1454
01:11:23,494 --> 01:11:27,434
Law had to know. That's
why he had the reaction.

1455
01:11:27,724 --> 01:11:29,254
He knew there were others.

1456
01:11:32,614 --> 01:11:34,454
I think that's the bigger story.

1457
01:11:36,014 --> 01:11:37,524
Bigger than 50 priests?

1458
01:11:38,274 --> 01:11:40,384
If it came from the top down? Yes.

1459
01:11:41,104 --> 01:11:42,692
But the numbers
clearly indicate that

1460
01:11:42,693 --> 01:11:44,154
there were senior clergy involved.

1461
01:11:44,174 --> 01:11:45,403
That's all they do "indicate".

1462
01:11:45,404 --> 01:11:46,453
Are you telling me that...

1463
01:11:46,454 --> 01:11:49,234
that if we run a story about 50
paedophile priests in Boston.

1464
01:11:49,253 --> 01:11:50,253
Mike.

1465
01:11:50,254 --> 01:11:53,004
We'll get into the same cat
fight you got into on Porter,

1466
01:11:53,014 --> 01:11:54,384
Which made a lot of noise,

1467
01:11:54,424 --> 01:11:56,354
but changed things not one bit.

1468
01:11:59,764 --> 01:12:01,624
We need to focus on
the institution.

1469
01:12:01,664 --> 01:12:03,294
Not the individual priests.

1470
01:12:03,694 --> 01:12:05,534
Practise and policy.

1471
01:12:05,604 --> 01:12:07,584
Show me the Church
manipulate the system...

1472
01:12:07,594 --> 01:12:09,274
so this guy wouldn't
have to face charges.

1473
01:12:09,304 --> 01:12:11,144
Show me they put those
same priests...

1474
01:12:11,204 --> 01:12:13,634
back into parishes
time and time again.

1475
01:12:13,654 --> 01:12:16,914
Show me this was systemic that
it came from the top down.

1476
01:12:19,194 --> 01:12:20,844
Sound like we're going after Law.

1477
01:12:25,224 --> 01:12:26,914
We're going after the system.

1478
01:12:30,124 --> 01:12:31,464
Make the list of
all the victims...

1479
01:12:31,484 --> 01:12:33,014
we have, start reaching out.

1480
01:12:33,134 --> 01:12:34,547
And bring Matt in
if you need help.

1481
01:12:34,548 --> 01:12:35,548
Ok.

1482
01:12:35,549 --> 01:12:36,759
Hey when do you go to Springfield?

1483
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:37,760
Hearing's on Monday.

1484
01:12:37,834 --> 01:12:38,834
Ok.

1485
01:12:39,214 --> 01:12:40,684
Hey, Robby, you got a second?

1486
01:12:41,174 --> 01:12:42,234
Yeah.

1487
01:12:43,404 --> 01:12:46,844
I got one of those treatment
centres a block from my house.

1488
01:12:49,374 --> 01:12:50,654
We got neighbours with kids.

1489
01:12:50,844 --> 01:12:53,354
I know that the work we
do is confidential but,

1490
01:12:53,474 --> 01:12:54,644
I'm feeling like...

1491
01:12:55,594 --> 01:12:56,794
I should tell 'em.

1492
01:13:01,054 --> 01:13:02,614
We'll tell 'em soon.

1493
01:13:02,984 --> 01:13:04,614
Are you sure?

1494
01:13:05,794 --> 01:13:07,294
- Yeah.
- Ok.

1495
01:13:10,504 --> 01:13:12,824
Hi there, I'm Sacha Pfeiffer,
with The Boston Globe.

1496
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:14,459
It's just looking
for the gentleman

1497
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:15,664
by the name of Matthew Walsh?

1498
01:13:17,584 --> 01:13:18,584
No, he's not.

1499
01:13:23,304 --> 01:13:24,814
Okay, okay.

1500
01:13:31,494 --> 01:13:32,754
- Hi.
- Hi.

1501
01:13:32,834 --> 01:13:34,364
I'm Sacha Pfeiffer
from The Boston Globe.

1502
01:13:34,403 --> 01:13:35,403
Yeah, what do you want?

1503
01:13:35,404 --> 01:13:37,254
I'd like to speak
with Thomas Kennedy?

1504
01:13:37,294 --> 01:13:38,294
He doesn't live here any more.

1505
01:13:38,574 --> 01:13:39,814
Do you know where he lives?

1506
01:13:40,334 --> 01:13:41,814
Sir, I'd just like to ask a few...

1507
01:13:43,694 --> 01:13:45,434
Sacha Pfeiffer, Boston Globe.

1508
01:13:45,474 --> 01:13:47,184
- Oh, yeah, hi.
- Hi. Thank you.

1509
01:13:48,884 --> 01:13:52,004
- Anything else you can recall?
- No.

1510
01:13:52,034 --> 01:13:53,884
No, but I got a
cousin in Queens...

1511
01:13:53,914 --> 01:13:55,734
she said saw him in the
streets a few years later.

1512
01:13:56,484 --> 01:13:58,124
The bishop came over to house.

1513
01:13:58,394 --> 01:14:00,114
He said nothing like this
ever happened before...

1514
01:14:00,154 --> 01:14:01,684
and he asked us not
to press charges.

1515
01:14:01,964 --> 01:14:03,154
And what did your mother do?

1516
01:14:03,784 --> 01:14:04,894
My mother?

1517
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:08,324
She put out freaking cookies.

1518
01:14:12,574 --> 01:14:14,894
There was a lot of
pressure to keep quiet.

1519
01:14:14,924 --> 01:14:15,943
From the Church?

1520
01:14:15,944 --> 01:14:19,284
Yeah, from the Church.
But not just the Church.

1521
01:14:20,214 --> 01:14:21,804
From my friends.

1522
01:14:22,684 --> 01:14:24,294
From the other parishioners.

1523
01:14:24,314 --> 01:14:27,074
Well, many of the priest
I treated were...

1524
01:14:27,144 --> 01:14:28,544
psychosexually stunted.

1525
01:14:28,784 --> 01:14:31,424
On the emotional level of
the 12 or 13 year old.

1526
01:14:31,453 --> 01:14:32,453
Jesus.

1527
01:14:32,454 --> 01:14:34,724
Sure the chief knew.
Everybody knew.

1528
01:14:34,744 --> 01:14:36,564
But nobody wants to
come for priest.

1529
01:14:38,024 --> 01:14:39,474
And what about the prosecutor?

1530
01:14:40,434 --> 01:14:42,194
I shouldn't talk about this shit.

1531
01:14:42,224 --> 01:14:43,604
I think you should, actually.

1532
01:14:44,264 --> 01:14:47,373
Do you know Father
Hurley or Father Gale?

1533
01:14:47,374 --> 01:14:48,374
I do.

1534
01:14:48,444 --> 01:14:49,744
Just get your shit out
of here, alright?

1535
01:14:49,745 --> 01:14:50,745
I'm sorry about it.

1536
01:14:50,774 --> 01:14:52,374
You leave me alone, you
leave my brother alone...

1537
01:14:52,375 --> 01:14:53,375
you hear me goddammit?

1538
01:15:01,784 --> 01:15:04,284
Hi there. I'm looking
for Ronald Paquin.

1539
01:15:04,314 --> 01:15:05,314
Yes?

1540
01:15:06,184 --> 01:15:08,644
- You're Father Paquin?
- Yes, that's right.

1541
01:15:09,724 --> 01:15:12,134
I'm Sacha Pfeiffer
from The Boston Globe.

1542
01:15:12,164 --> 01:15:13,164
Ok.

1543
01:15:13,165 --> 01:15:14,574
Could I ask you a few questions?

1544
01:15:14,604 --> 01:15:15,604
Go ahead, dear.

1545
01:15:16,734 --> 01:15:18,683
We spoke to several men who
knew you when they were boys...

1546
01:15:18,684 --> 01:15:20,544
at St. John the
Baptist in Haverhill.

1547
01:15:23,044 --> 01:15:25,074
They told us you molested
them, is that true?

1548
01:15:27,244 --> 01:15:28,534
Sure, I fooled around.

1549
01:15:28,664 --> 01:15:31,664
But I never felt gratified myself.

1550
01:15:32,784 --> 01:15:37,014
Right, but you admit to molesting
the boys at St. John the Baptist?

1551
01:15:37,824 --> 01:15:42,094
Yes, yes, but as I said, I never
got any pleasure from them.

1552
01:15:42,524 --> 01:15:44,054
That's important to understand.

1553
01:15:44,724 --> 01:15:47,454
Right, but...

1554
01:15:47,494 --> 01:15:50,414
Can you tell me where and how you
fooled around with these boys?

1555
01:15:52,374 --> 01:15:55,554
I want to be clear, I
never raped anybody.

1556
01:15:56,544 --> 01:15:58,894
There's a difference.
I should know.

1557
01:15:59,414 --> 01:16:01,884
- How would you know?
- I was raped.

1558
01:16:04,484 --> 01:16:06,614
I'm sorry, who raped you?

1559
01:16:06,634 --> 01:16:08,004
Ronny? Who are you talking too?

1560
01:16:08,024 --> 01:16:09,644
- It's ok, Jane.
- Father, who raped you?

1561
01:16:09,674 --> 01:16:10,674
Who are you?

1562
01:16:11,024 --> 01:16:14,324
- Sacha Pfeiffer, from The Globe.
- Please, get off my porch.

1563
01:16:14,344 --> 01:16:16,514
Get inside the house, Ronald.

1564
01:16:16,794 --> 01:16:18,544
- Get inside Ronald.
- I'm sorry.

1565
01:16:18,594 --> 01:16:20,584
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- I'm his sister.

1566
01:16:20,934 --> 01:16:22,450
And I don't want you
coming back here.

1567
01:16:22,451 --> 01:16:23,451
Miss Paquin?

1568
01:16:32,614 --> 01:16:34,574
No, you won't, I beat
you last time...

1569
01:16:34,744 --> 01:16:35,814
Cause you cheated...

1570
01:16:43,524 --> 01:16:45,817
Could you please
clarify The Globe's

1571
01:16:45,818 --> 01:16:47,614
position for me, Mr Albano?

1572
01:16:47,644 --> 01:16:48,804
Yes, Judge Sweeney.

1573
01:16:53,294 --> 01:16:56,114
Our argument to make this
documents public rest...

1574
01:16:56,134 --> 01:16:58,614
mainly on First Amendment grounds.

1575
01:16:58,734 --> 01:17:01,144
We also have a number of
other relevant arguments.

1576
01:17:01,334 --> 01:17:03,994
After all, Your Honour, this
was discretionary audit.

1577
01:17:04,074 --> 01:17:06,744
Yes, it was made the
Judges discretionary.

1578
01:17:06,774 --> 01:17:07,774
Hey Mike.

1579
01:17:08,914 --> 01:17:09,914
Hey, Joe.

1580
01:17:10,284 --> 01:17:12,664
What's the Spotlight reporter
doing in Springfield?

1581
01:17:15,014 --> 01:17:17,294
Your boy Albano is
sledding uphill.

1582
01:17:17,584 --> 01:17:19,434
Actually thinking he has a
shot of winning this thing?

1583
01:17:19,624 --> 01:17:21,224
You want me to comment
for The Herald?

1584
01:17:23,594 --> 01:17:26,304
Globe reporter would not comment.

1585
01:17:26,934 --> 01:17:29,414
But he did not seem hopeful.

1586
01:17:30,804 --> 01:17:32,604
He didn't try to hide it at all.

1587
01:17:32,734 --> 01:17:35,944
He had this really odd
rationalisation for it,

1588
01:17:35,964 --> 01:17:38,434
like it was totally normal to
fool around with little boys.

1589
01:17:39,314 --> 01:17:41,754
I'd really like to go back,
I think he'd talk to us.

1590
01:17:42,384 --> 01:17:43,684
Oh, we will.

1591
01:17:44,384 --> 01:17:45,694
Just not yet.

1592
01:17:45,784 --> 01:17:48,694
I want you to stay focused
on the victims right now.

1593
01:17:48,714 --> 01:17:50,694
Sacha, where did they
send Father Talbot again?

1594
01:17:51,024 --> 01:17:54,624
- I think it was Cheverus?
- Cheverus, that's right.

1595
01:17:54,654 --> 01:17:57,574
Wait, Father Talbot? From BC High?

1596
01:17:57,724 --> 01:17:59,154
Yeah, you know him?

1597
01:17:59,314 --> 01:18:01,254
Yeah, he was there when I was.

1598
01:18:02,364 --> 01:18:03,914
- We have a victim?
- Yeah.

1599
01:18:04,734 --> 01:18:05,904
Lives in Providence.

1600
01:18:09,274 --> 01:18:11,494
There's nothing personal within
this documents, Your Honour.

1601
01:18:12,274 --> 01:18:14,054
They concern how the
Cardinal is handling...

1602
01:18:14,094 --> 01:18:15,544
Say the "Archdiocese".

1603
01:18:16,514 --> 01:18:17,514
Excuse me?

1604
01:18:18,144 --> 01:18:21,024
You don't get to tag the Cardinal
with everything, Mr Albano.

1605
01:18:21,114 --> 01:18:22,934
Say, the Archdiocese.

1606
01:18:23,524 --> 01:18:25,584
Judge Sweeney, The Globe is
not a party to this case.

1607
01:18:25,614 --> 01:18:26,924
They just want to sell the papers.

1608
01:18:27,024 --> 01:18:28,984
If Mr Garabedian hadn't...

1609
01:18:29,024 --> 01:18:30,774
smeared the Cardinal's
good name...

1610
01:18:30,864 --> 01:18:32,614
- We wouldn't even be here.
- Your Honour,

1611
01:18:32,634 --> 01:18:34,714
I object to the use
of the word "smear".

1612
01:18:34,994 --> 01:18:37,574
- Duly noted, Mr Garabedian.
- Thank you, Your Honour.

1613
01:18:37,764 --> 01:18:39,884
- Anything else, Mr Rogers?
- No, Your Honour.

1614
01:18:39,974 --> 01:18:41,794
Sr. Albano, you may continue.

1615
01:18:42,174 --> 01:18:43,594
The Globe believe having...

1616
01:18:45,674 --> 01:18:46,884
Hey, Mitch, how you doing?

1617
01:18:48,174 --> 01:18:49,174
I'm fine.

1618
01:18:49,844 --> 01:18:51,564
He's tough that Wilson Rogers.

1619
01:18:52,614 --> 01:18:53,814
He's smug.

1620
01:18:54,454 --> 01:18:57,134
- He's sloppy.
- Doesn't seem sloppy.

1621
01:18:58,284 --> 01:19:00,224
You don't know the
half of it. Trust me.

1622
01:19:01,294 --> 01:19:02,534
What's the half of it?

1623
01:19:05,264 --> 01:19:06,604
Tell me the half of it, Mitch?

1624
01:19:08,604 --> 01:19:10,364
- Of the record.
- Of the record, yeah.

1625
01:19:14,334 --> 01:19:16,294
3 years ago I get the
call from an ex-priest.

1626
01:19:16,844 --> 01:19:18,194
Anthony Benzevich.

1627
01:19:18,224 --> 01:19:20,364
He was at Blessed
Sacrament back in '62...

1628
01:19:20,374 --> 01:19:21,754
and he saw Geoghan...

1629
01:19:24,014 --> 01:19:26,684
taking little boys up to
the rectory bedroom, ok?

1630
01:19:26,704 --> 01:19:27,804
So he was appalled,

1631
01:19:30,354 --> 01:19:32,104
And the bishop threatens
to reassign him.

1632
01:19:32,554 --> 01:19:34,924
- To South America.
- Jesus.

1633
01:19:34,954 --> 01:19:37,244
Yeah. Alright, so
fast-forward 35 years.

1634
01:19:37,264 --> 01:19:39,323
Benzevich reads that Geoghan
has been charged...

1635
01:19:39,324 --> 01:19:41,334
with molesting hundreds of kids.

1636
01:19:41,354 --> 01:19:43,424
So he feels guilty
and he calls me.

1637
01:19:43,564 --> 01:19:45,634
So you have a testimony
of a priest...

1638
01:19:45,674 --> 01:19:48,074
telling his superiors
about Geoghan in '62?

1639
01:19:48,574 --> 01:19:49,874
No, I do not.

1640
01:19:50,174 --> 01:19:52,474
Because when I call Benzevich
in to give a deposition...

1641
01:19:52,874 --> 01:19:54,334
He comes in with the lawyer.

1642
01:19:55,014 --> 01:19:56,464
- Wilson Rogers?
- Right.

1643
01:19:57,014 --> 01:19:59,674
And suddenly, Father Benzevich
has a foggy memory.

1644
01:19:59,754 --> 01:20:01,744
Can't remember anything.
He's useless.

1645
01:20:01,884 --> 01:20:04,424
So, I go back to work. I
forget about it, whatever.

1646
01:20:05,054 --> 01:20:07,934
Until about a year ago, I find
an article about a priest...

1647
01:20:08,154 --> 01:20:10,424
who warned Church
officials about Geoghan.

1648
01:20:10,664 --> 01:20:12,544
- Benzevich went to the press?
- Yeah.

1649
01:20:12,794 --> 01:20:14,654
Yeah, local paper Patriot Ledger,

1650
01:20:14,664 --> 01:20:17,244
nobody saw it, but now I
got Benzevich on record.

1651
01:20:17,304 --> 01:20:19,144
So, I file a motion to depose...

1652
01:20:19,154 --> 01:20:20,534
Benzevich the second time.

1653
01:20:21,074 --> 01:20:24,334
Alright? And Wilson Rogers,
that smug son of a bitch,

1654
01:20:24,474 --> 01:20:27,144
he files a motion
opposing my motion.

1655
01:20:27,614 --> 01:20:29,414
And that's when I have him.

1656
01:20:30,684 --> 01:20:31,794
Have, have him how?

1657
01:20:31,984 --> 01:20:33,764
Rogers opposes my motion.

1658
01:20:34,084 --> 01:20:36,383
So I have to make an argument
as to why am I allowed to...

1659
01:20:36,384 --> 01:20:38,984
depose Father Benzevich
the second time, ok?

1660
01:20:38,994 --> 01:20:41,254
But this time I'm allowed
to attach exhibits.

1661
01:20:41,874 --> 01:20:42,914
You follow what I'm saying?

1662
01:20:43,274 --> 01:20:44,714
The sealed documents?

1663
01:20:44,744 --> 01:20:46,564
Yes. I can attach the
sealed documents...

1664
01:20:46,694 --> 01:20:49,284
that I've gotten in
discovery, Mr Rezendes.

1665
01:20:49,304 --> 01:20:52,724
The same documents that your
paper is currently suing for.

1666
01:20:53,274 --> 01:20:54,624
You're shitting me?

1667
01:20:54,774 --> 01:20:56,624
What? No, no, I'm
not shitting you.

1668
01:20:56,654 --> 01:20:59,644
So, I pull out the 14
most damning docs...

1669
01:20:59,684 --> 01:21:00,944
and I attach them to my motion.

1670
01:21:01,084 --> 01:21:02,644
And they prove
everything. Everything.

1671
01:21:02,944 --> 01:21:05,394
About the Church, about
the bishops, about Law.

1672
01:21:05,484 --> 01:21:06,604
And it's all public...

1673
01:21:07,324 --> 01:21:08,324
Because your motion...

1674
01:21:08,344 --> 01:21:09,944
to oppose Rogers motion is public.

1675
01:21:10,384 --> 01:21:13,244
Is public, yeah. Exactly. Now
you're paying attention.

1676
01:21:13,594 --> 01:21:15,724
And so I could just walk in to
that courthouse right now...

1677
01:21:15,764 --> 01:21:16,824
and get those documents?

1678
01:21:16,864 --> 01:21:18,234
No, you can not.

1679
01:21:18,664 --> 01:21:20,434
Because the documents
are not there.

1680
01:21:20,764 --> 01:21:22,054
But you just said they're public.

1681
01:21:22,184 --> 01:21:25,364
I know I did. But this is Boston.

1682
01:21:25,404 --> 01:21:28,304
And the Church does not
want them to be found,

1683
01:21:28,464 --> 01:21:30,504
so, they are not there.

1684
01:21:32,774 --> 01:21:35,094
Mitch, are you telling me
that the Catholic Church...

1685
01:21:35,124 --> 01:21:37,494
removed legal documents
from that courthouse?

1686
01:21:37,654 --> 01:21:40,884
Look, I'm not crazy,
I'm not paranoid,

1687
01:21:41,284 --> 01:21:42,434
I'm experienced.

1688
01:21:42,584 --> 01:21:44,434
Check the docket, you'll see.

1689
01:21:45,694 --> 01:21:47,004
They control everything.

1690
01:21:50,024 --> 01:21:51,024
Everything.

1691
01:21:53,194 --> 01:21:54,294
I got to go back.

1692
01:21:58,434 --> 01:22:00,934
I got to get the
fucking documents.

1693
01:22:15,784 --> 01:22:18,364
Docket entry number 49,
with the Geoghan case.

1694
01:22:18,383 --> 01:22:19,383
Ok, thanks.

1695
01:22:19,384 --> 01:22:22,074
- We're closing in 10 minutes.
- 10 minutes? Alright.

1696
01:22:51,404 --> 01:22:53,964
Rev. James F. Talbot.

1697
01:22:59,034 --> 01:23:00,764
- Robby.
- Hey, it's me.

1698
01:23:01,094 --> 01:23:02,354
- Hey.
- You're not gonna believe it.

1699
01:23:02,604 --> 01:23:04,004
Garabedian gave me a tip.

1700
01:23:04,194 --> 01:23:06,634
Some of the sealed docs
are already public.

1701
01:23:06,654 --> 01:23:08,044
They're part of the
motion he filed.

1702
01:23:08,074 --> 01:23:10,174
He said they're the best of a
bunch, we don't have to...

1703
01:23:10,204 --> 01:23:11,544
wait for Sweeney's ruling.

1704
01:23:11,584 --> 01:23:12,734
So, we can get them?

1705
01:23:12,744 --> 01:23:14,254
Yeah, but they are not there.

1706
01:23:14,264 --> 01:23:15,264
I already talked to Albano,

1707
01:23:15,274 --> 01:23:16,744
he said all we have to do is...

1708
01:23:16,814 --> 01:23:17,974
file a motion and Sweeney will...

1709
01:23:18,014 --> 01:23:20,154
order Mitch to refile the docs.

1710
01:23:20,284 --> 01:23:21,734
And you think this
documents are...?

1711
01:23:21,764 --> 01:23:23,794
He said this 14 docs
are all we need.

1712
01:23:23,824 --> 01:23:24,934
They are huge.

1713
01:23:25,094 --> 01:23:28,994
Ok. I'll call Ben. Good work.

1714
01:23:54,484 --> 01:23:55,484
What happened?

1715
01:23:56,114 --> 01:23:58,044
They are saying it's a prop plane.

1716
01:23:58,224 --> 01:23:59,574
But that's not a prop plane.

1717
01:24:03,754 --> 01:24:04,754
Tell Linda to get every...

1718
01:24:04,755 --> 01:24:06,514
reporter we have in here now.

1719
01:24:08,134 --> 01:24:12,214
You pray for the victims,
you pray for the injured...

1720
01:24:13,254 --> 01:24:15,484
and you pray for
those who survived.

1721
01:24:16,874 --> 01:24:19,754
You pray too for the nation.

1722
01:24:21,014 --> 01:24:23,084
That our response to this...

1723
01:24:23,534 --> 01:24:27,684
might reflect the best
ideals of our nation.

1724
01:24:28,314 --> 01:24:31,224
And even more reflect
God's own teaching.

1725
01:24:31,624 --> 01:24:35,824
Not only as it's shown in
Christianity and Judaism...

1726
01:24:35,994 --> 01:24:38,234
but in Islam as well.

1727
01:24:38,494 --> 01:24:40,844
- Not bad. Who's there?
- Paulson.

1728
01:24:40,874 --> 01:24:42,564
I want to talk to
him when he's back.

1729
01:24:42,854 --> 01:24:45,064
Did Rezendes find a way
to get to Florida yet?

1730
01:24:45,094 --> 01:24:46,914
They just opened the
airport in Providence,

1731
01:24:46,954 --> 01:24:48,164
he's on his way there now.

1732
01:24:48,174 --> 01:24:49,684
Ben, I'm gonna need more
people on Massport.

1733
01:24:50,174 --> 01:24:51,684
I'll give you three of my guys.

1734
01:24:51,704 --> 01:24:53,814
Robby, put your team
on that too. Got it.

1735
01:24:53,914 --> 01:24:55,793
And Robby, everything else stops.

1736
01:24:55,794 --> 01:24:56,794
Understood.

1737
01:24:56,795 --> 01:24:59,124
- Why is Mike going to Florida?
- Flight school.

1738
01:24:59,134 --> 01:25:00,344
That's where they learned to fly.

1739
01:25:00,984 --> 01:25:02,134
Robby, I've got...

1740
01:25:02,174 --> 01:25:04,004
a lot of victims introduce
set up this week.

1741
01:25:04,024 --> 01:25:05,284
We got to cancel them.

1742
01:25:05,334 --> 01:25:06,403
That's gonna be hard.

1743
01:25:06,404 --> 01:25:07,404
I know.

1744
01:25:07,405 --> 01:25:08,414
This is nuts. Two days ago...

1745
01:25:08,424 --> 01:25:09,634
I told my wife we
gotta be working...

1746
01:25:09,644 --> 01:25:10,934
on biggest story on the planet.

1747
01:25:10,954 --> 01:25:14,444
- Boston Globe.
- Boston Globe, one moment please.

1748
01:25:14,484 --> 01:25:16,354
- Yes if you have a tip, I...
- Boston Globe...

1749
01:25:18,973 --> 01:25:19,973
Mitchell Garabedian.

1750
01:25:19,974 --> 01:25:21,724
Mitch, it's Mike. I've
been trying to reach you.

1751
01:25:21,764 --> 01:25:23,544
I don't have time to talk
to you, Mr Rezendes.

1752
01:25:23,574 --> 01:25:26,144
Hey just quickly. Did you
refile those docs yet?

1753
01:25:26,184 --> 01:25:27,354
No, I just got the order.

1754
01:25:27,393 --> 01:25:28,393
It takes time.

1755
01:25:28,394 --> 01:25:29,524
Ok, great. Can you hold off...

1756
01:25:30,283 --> 01:25:31,283
I have to go to Florida...

1757
01:25:31,284 --> 01:25:33,154
Once you refile, they're public.

1758
01:25:33,194 --> 01:25:34,984
Other newspaper will be
able to get a hold of them.

1759
01:25:35,014 --> 01:25:37,424
"Other newspapers
are not my concern.

1760
01:25:37,484 --> 01:25:39,104
I received the judicial order.

1761
01:25:39,484 --> 01:25:41,104
I told you the Church
is watching me.

1762
01:25:41,124 --> 01:25:42,414
Hey Mitch, please.

1763
01:25:42,444 --> 01:25:44,084
All I need is a few more weeks.

1764
01:25:45,324 --> 01:25:47,244
I can't make any
promises. Goodbye.

1765
01:25:47,324 --> 01:25:49,774
Mitch. Mitch. Shit.

1766
01:25:51,764 --> 01:25:52,764
Shit.

1767
01:26:01,714 --> 01:26:03,114
Look, I get it.

1768
01:26:03,164 --> 01:26:05,314
No one wants to read about
kids getting raped by priests.

1769
01:26:05,514 --> 01:26:06,874
Especially now, but you asked...

1770
01:26:06,894 --> 01:26:08,094
a lot of people to relive...

1771
01:26:08,104 --> 01:26:10,094
some very painful experiences...

1772
01:26:10,114 --> 01:26:12,434
Phil you know why we were
taking off this story...

1773
01:26:12,454 --> 01:26:14,174
It's been six weeks since 9/11.

1774
01:26:14,194 --> 01:26:16,474
I realise that, and we're
gonna get back to it.

1775
01:26:16,494 --> 01:26:17,494
When?

1776
01:26:19,024 --> 01:26:20,893
You're doing the same thing
you guys did the last time.

1777
01:26:20,894 --> 01:26:21,894
No.

1778
01:26:21,895 --> 01:26:22,974
- You're dropping us.
- No.

1779
01:26:23,004 --> 01:26:24,764
Maybe I should tell The
Herald that story.

1780
01:26:25,674 --> 01:26:27,824
Ok, Phil. You go
ahead and do that.

1781
01:26:28,414 --> 01:26:30,524
It'll undo all the
work we've done.

1782
01:26:30,554 --> 01:26:31,824
But I can't stop you.

1783
01:26:33,724 --> 01:26:35,124
Listen to me.

1784
01:26:35,524 --> 01:26:37,514
I am here because I care.

1785
01:26:39,484 --> 01:26:40,954
We're not going away.

1786
01:26:41,604 --> 01:26:43,764
We're gonna tell this story,
we're gonna tell it right.

1787
01:26:43,794 --> 01:26:45,284
We just need a little more time.

1788
01:26:45,324 --> 01:26:46,814
That's all we're asking for.

1789
01:26:49,424 --> 01:26:51,074
Why bother asking?

1790
01:26:52,474 --> 01:26:54,164
You're gonna do what
you want anyway.

1791
01:26:55,594 --> 01:26:56,764
You always do.

1792
01:26:57,784 --> 01:27:00,524
Phil... Phil.

1793
01:27:06,873 --> 01:27:07,873
Hey.

1794
01:27:07,874 --> 01:27:09,114
How's South Beach?

1795
01:27:09,364 --> 01:27:10,404
It's Boynton Beach.

1796
01:27:10,734 --> 01:27:12,404
Remarkably different place.

1797
01:27:12,484 --> 01:27:13,484
What's up?

1798
01:27:13,764 --> 01:27:15,684
Mitch Garabedian called me today.

1799
01:27:16,074 --> 01:27:17,224
Why did he call you?

1800
01:27:17,244 --> 01:27:18,524
Because he knew you'd yell at him.

1801
01:27:18,764 --> 01:27:20,324
He refiled the docs.

1802
01:27:20,344 --> 01:27:21,494
What?

1803
01:27:21,744 --> 01:27:23,494
Robby, those docs are public now.

1804
01:27:23,514 --> 01:27:25,048
We got to get there before
everybody else does.

1805
01:27:25,049 --> 01:27:26,189
I know, I know, I know.

1806
01:27:26,714 --> 01:27:28,124
Just wrap up whatever
you're doing...

1807
01:27:28,154 --> 01:27:29,594
and get the first flight out.

1808
01:27:29,624 --> 01:27:30,658
I'll book the flight now and go

1809
01:27:30,659 --> 01:27:31,858
straight to the
courthouse tomorrow.

1810
01:27:31,859 --> 01:27:33,307
Alright, call me when you get in.

1811
01:27:33,308 --> 01:27:34,308
Ok.

1812
01:27:35,774 --> 01:27:38,754
Robby, I'll go to a Phil Saviano
now that we're back on it.

1813
01:27:38,904 --> 01:27:40,154
Good idea.

1814
01:27:40,904 --> 01:27:42,154
Go and have dinner with Hansi.

1815
01:27:42,174 --> 01:27:43,844
Might be the last
time for a while.

1816
01:27:49,554 --> 01:27:50,824
- Robby.
- Yeah?

1817
01:27:50,854 --> 01:27:53,574
After we saw Macleish, I started
going back through the clips...

1818
01:27:53,754 --> 01:27:56,664
and I had a little time
last week finally, so...

1819
01:27:58,294 --> 01:27:59,434
I found that.

1820
01:28:00,294 --> 01:28:01,534
It's from'93.

1821
01:28:03,654 --> 01:28:05,304
Lawyer for Porter victims says...

1822
01:28:05,314 --> 01:28:07,114
20 other priests in
area are accused.

1823
01:28:12,274 --> 01:28:13,274
Is that it?

1824
01:28:15,474 --> 01:28:17,054
Yeah, yeah... That's it.

1825
01:28:19,954 --> 01:28:23,494
- Good night.
- Ok. Good night.

1826
01:29:03,564 --> 01:29:05,694
So I was probably a few
years after you, right?

1827
01:29:05,704 --> 01:29:08,804
No, you were more than
a few. Believe me.

1828
01:29:09,764 --> 01:29:12,654
After the BC High, I came
down to Providence...

1829
01:29:12,884 --> 01:29:14,494
I played hockey for the Friars.

1830
01:29:15,104 --> 01:29:17,634
Oh well, you must've
been pretty good.

1831
01:29:17,734 --> 01:29:19,894
No, rode the bench
in college. Yeah.

1832
01:29:20,314 --> 01:29:21,404
But I love the city.

1833
01:29:22,364 --> 01:29:24,284
And we just had our third kid.

1834
01:29:24,514 --> 01:29:26,554
And I still get my
Globe, for the record.

1835
01:29:26,644 --> 01:29:28,824
That's good to know, good to know.

1836
01:29:29,624 --> 01:29:30,874
Look, Kevin...

1837
01:29:32,264 --> 01:29:33,674
It's actually why I'm here.

1838
01:29:35,194 --> 01:29:36,264
I...

1839
01:29:36,594 --> 01:29:39,164
Need to ask you some questions
about Father Talbot.

1840
01:29:46,674 --> 01:29:47,844
How'd you find out?

1841
01:29:48,974 --> 01:29:50,244
Well...

1842
01:29:51,704 --> 01:29:53,134
I guess it doesn't matter.

1843
01:29:58,984 --> 01:30:01,574
I never even told my wife.

1844
01:30:03,724 --> 01:30:04,724
Excuse me.

1845
01:30:09,864 --> 01:30:11,854
Hey, hey, I need to get in there.

1846
01:30:11,864 --> 01:30:12,864
We're closed.

1847
01:30:12,904 --> 01:30:14,054
Come on, let me in, five minutes.

1848
01:30:14,073 --> 01:30:15,073
I'm sorry, we're closed.

1849
01:30:15,074 --> 01:30:16,354
Come on, 5 minutes.

1850
01:30:16,644 --> 01:30:17,644
Fuck.

1851
01:30:31,714 --> 01:30:32,804
Here you go.

1852
01:30:36,554 --> 01:30:38,124
- This is the Geoghan case?
- That's right.

1853
01:30:38,984 --> 01:30:40,414
Those records are sealed.

1854
01:30:40,484 --> 01:30:42,014
No. That's a public motion.

1855
01:30:42,034 --> 01:30:43,424
Those record are public.

1856
01:30:43,634 --> 01:30:44,824
Look, I work for The Globe.

1857
01:30:45,824 --> 01:30:46,824
Good for you.

1858
01:30:48,894 --> 01:30:50,124
Can I talk to your supervisor?

1859
01:30:50,134 --> 01:30:51,314
He's not in today.

1860
01:30:52,493 --> 01:30:53,493
What about a Judge?

1861
01:30:53,494 --> 01:30:55,864
There must be Judges that
work on this kind of thing.

1862
01:30:56,744 --> 01:30:57,744
Sixth floor.

1863
01:31:04,284 --> 01:31:06,124
We understand the nature...

1864
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:07,844
of the allegations
against Father Talbot.

1865
01:31:08,414 --> 01:31:11,274
I'm just not sure what you
want from President Kemeza.

1866
01:31:12,254 --> 01:31:14,594
Talbot taught here long
before Bill took over.

1867
01:31:14,754 --> 01:31:15,754
Of course.

1868
01:31:15,854 --> 01:31:17,994
We just want to know
if that's possible...

1869
01:31:18,034 --> 01:31:20,144
that the President, the
Faculty, the Board...

1870
01:31:20,294 --> 01:31:22,054
that no one knew what was
going on at the time.

1871
01:31:22,194 --> 01:31:24,334
I graduated in 1979 and...

1872
01:31:24,594 --> 01:31:26,334
I had no idea about
any of this, so...

1873
01:31:26,634 --> 01:31:28,164
If you're suggesting
that Father Gibbons...

1874
01:31:28,184 --> 01:31:30,104
and Father Callahan
had in anyway...

1875
01:31:30,124 --> 01:31:34,044
Gibbons and Callahan ran
this place like the navy,

1876
01:31:34,974 --> 01:31:36,404
You really think they didn't know?

1877
01:31:37,644 --> 01:31:39,334
It's a big school,
Robby. You know that.

1878
01:31:40,154 --> 01:31:42,333
And we're talking about seven...

1879
01:31:42,334 --> 01:31:44,444
alleged victims over
what, eight years?

1880
01:31:44,464 --> 01:31:47,844
We're talking about...
Seven that we know about.

1881
01:31:48,034 --> 01:31:49,524
This is ridiculous.

1882
01:31:50,164 --> 01:31:52,071
You're reaching for
the story here...

1883
01:31:52,072 --> 01:31:53,072
Jack. Jack, Jack.

1884
01:31:53,834 --> 01:31:56,794
If I had been President
then, I would have known.

1885
01:31:57,464 --> 01:31:59,624
Bill, I'm not sure
that's relevant.

1886
01:31:59,654 --> 01:32:02,354
Why do you think they sent
Talbot up to Cheverus?

1887
01:32:02,644 --> 01:32:04,704
You know, they wanted
him out of town.

1888
01:32:06,714 --> 01:32:07,714
Robby...

1889
01:32:07,774 --> 01:32:09,903
As well intentioned this
Bill's remarks are,

1890
01:32:09,904 --> 01:32:11,823
I'm hoping we can keep
this between us...

1891
01:32:11,824 --> 01:32:14,104
until we all get on the same page.

1892
01:32:17,354 --> 01:32:19,684
Is that why we are here?
To get on the same page?

1893
01:32:19,724 --> 01:32:22,174
No. We're here because you're
an important alumnus Robby...

1894
01:32:22,214 --> 01:32:23,214
and a friend.

1895
01:32:23,215 --> 01:32:25,074
Exactly. And we know...

1896
01:32:25,114 --> 01:32:27,094
you care about the
school as much as we do.

1897
01:32:29,064 --> 01:32:31,194
Did you play your
sport here, Jack?

1898
01:32:31,234 --> 01:32:33,014
Yeah, football. Why?

1899
01:32:33,534 --> 01:32:34,924
I ran track.

1900
01:32:35,134 --> 01:32:37,324
You know, I went to
Providence yesterday...

1901
01:32:37,344 --> 01:32:39,504
talked to one of
Father Talbot victims.

1902
01:32:39,534 --> 01:32:42,294
He played hockey here... And...

1903
01:32:42,334 --> 01:32:43,604
He was one of the better ones...

1904
01:32:43,624 --> 01:32:45,514
He's got wife, kids...

1905
01:32:45,714 --> 01:32:47,494
good job.

1906
01:32:47,714 --> 01:32:50,494
About 10 minutes into
the conversation...

1907
01:32:51,934 --> 01:32:53,284
guy breaks down.

1908
01:32:53,894 --> 01:32:55,414
You know, couldn't stop crying.

1909
01:32:57,074 --> 01:32:58,774
Said he could never
figure out why...

1910
01:32:58,804 --> 01:33:00,554
Father Talbot picked him.

1911
01:33:02,864 --> 01:33:05,214
Father Talbot coached
the hockey team.

1912
01:33:07,374 --> 01:33:08,404
So...

1913
01:33:09,974 --> 01:33:11,794
I guess we just got lucky.

1914
01:33:12,774 --> 01:33:13,794
You and me.

1915
01:33:20,584 --> 01:33:21,874
Does Jack Dunn work
for the school?

1916
01:33:21,994 --> 01:33:24,114
No. He's PR for the
Boston College.

1917
01:33:24,154 --> 01:33:26,094
They call him when they need help.

1918
01:33:26,164 --> 01:33:28,054
And Pete Conley, why was he there?

1919
01:33:28,094 --> 01:33:29,314
Good question.

1920
01:33:29,394 --> 01:33:31,314
Pete's a big alum, but I
called Bill directly...

1921
01:33:31,334 --> 01:33:32,744
and I asked for a sit-down,

1922
01:33:32,834 --> 01:33:34,344
I never mentioned anybody else.

1923
01:33:36,404 --> 01:33:38,264
Looks like everybody
already knows the story.

1924
01:33:38,474 --> 01:33:40,514
Yeah, except us...

1925
01:33:40,604 --> 01:33:41,904
and we work right there.

1926
01:33:45,604 --> 01:33:47,534
- Judge Volterra?
- Yes.

1927
01:33:47,644 --> 01:33:49,894
Hi, I'm Mike Rezendes
from The Boston Globe.

1928
01:33:49,924 --> 01:33:51,334
I've been having some troubles...

1929
01:33:51,424 --> 01:33:53,494
accessing some public records
down in the records room.

1930
01:33:53,524 --> 01:33:56,204
I was wondering if I can
have a word with you?

1931
01:33:56,244 --> 01:33:57,574
- Alright.
- Thank you.

1932
01:34:03,224 --> 01:34:06,134
These exhibits you're
after Mr Rezendes...

1933
01:34:07,244 --> 01:34:09,044
They're very sensitive records.

1934
01:34:09,734 --> 01:34:12,374
With all due respect Your Honour,
that's not the question.

1935
01:34:13,234 --> 01:34:14,554
The records are public.

1936
01:34:15,874 --> 01:34:17,864
Maybe so, but tell me...

1937
01:34:18,184 --> 01:34:20,724
Where is the editorial
responsibility...

1938
01:34:20,734 --> 01:34:22,644
In publishing records
of this nature?

1939
01:34:22,784 --> 01:34:24,584
Well, where is the editorial
responsibility...

1940
01:34:24,594 --> 01:34:26,144
in not publishing them?

1941
01:34:36,864 --> 01:34:39,254
You can't take those. You
need to make copies.

1942
01:34:39,394 --> 01:34:42,044
- I'm going to the copy room.
- It's been closed at 4 p.m.

1943
01:34:46,904 --> 01:34:48,834
Look, I'll give you...

1944
01:34:50,974 --> 01:34:52,634
$83 to use yours.

1945
01:34:58,844 --> 01:35:00,244
Hey, cab.

1946
01:35:01,384 --> 01:35:04,334
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

1947
01:35:07,194 --> 01:35:09,284
Take me to The Boston Globe
on Morrissey Boulevard.

1948
01:35:09,764 --> 01:35:12,974
Don't take 93, take
Dorchester Avenue.

1949
01:35:14,834 --> 01:35:16,234
Robby, it's incredible.

1950
01:35:16,484 --> 01:35:19,494
Law knew about Geoghan
for years, no question.

1951
01:35:19,774 --> 01:35:21,744
There's a letter to Law...

1952
01:35:21,754 --> 01:35:24,144
from a woman, Margaret Gallant,
who lived in Jamaica Plain...

1953
01:35:24,154 --> 01:35:25,944
in early 80's when
Geoghan was there.

1954
01:35:25,964 --> 01:35:26,964
Listen to this.

1955
01:35:27,214 --> 01:35:29,544
Our family is rooted
in the Church.

1956
01:35:29,574 --> 01:35:32,324
Our desire is to protect
the holy orders.

1957
01:35:32,514 --> 01:35:34,674
Even in the midst of our agony...

1958
01:35:34,684 --> 01:35:36,274
over the seven boys
in our family...

1959
01:35:36,404 --> 01:35:38,074
who have been violated.

1960
01:35:38,094 --> 01:35:39,984
Seven Robby. Seven boys.

1961
01:35:40,554 --> 01:35:43,234
It was suggested
that we keep silent.

1962
01:35:43,724 --> 01:35:45,684
We did not question the
Authority of the Church...

1963
01:35:45,724 --> 01:35:46,924
two years ago.

1964
01:35:47,064 --> 01:35:49,854
But since, Father Geoghan
is still in his parish.

1965
01:35:49,934 --> 01:35:53,264
Which she send it to
Law and Law did shit.

1966
01:35:53,734 --> 01:35:55,524
Here's another one
to Law, same year.

1967
01:35:55,784 --> 01:35:56,784
Listen to this.

1968
01:35:57,274 --> 01:35:59,824
"A word on the recent assignment
to Father Geoghan..."

1969
01:35:59,854 --> 01:36:02,374
"as an associate at Saint
Julia's in Weston..."

1970
01:36:02,814 --> 01:36:05,674
"Father Geoghan has a history
of homosexual involvement..."

1971
01:36:05,814 --> 01:36:07,224
with young boys.

1972
01:36:07,524 --> 01:36:09,944
I understand his recent departure
from Saint Brendan's may be...

1973
01:36:09,964 --> 01:36:11,344
related to this problem."

1974
01:36:11,434 --> 01:36:13,324
"I wonder if Father
Geoghan should not be..."

1975
01:36:13,354 --> 01:36:15,214
reduced to just
weekend work while...

1976
01:36:15,224 --> 01:36:16,654
receiving some kind of therapy.

1977
01:36:17,094 --> 01:36:19,794
You know how grateful I am to
you for you constant concern...

1978
01:36:19,814 --> 01:36:21,624
sincerely yours in our Lord,

1979
01:36:21,664 --> 01:36:23,434
most reverend John M. Darcy,

1980
01:36:23,454 --> 01:36:27,074
Auxiliary Bishop of Boston.
December 7, 1984."

1981
01:36:27,104 --> 01:36:28,354
An Auxiliary Bishop wrote that?

1982
01:36:28,504 --> 01:36:29,554
That's incredible.

1983
01:36:30,304 --> 01:36:33,474
He broke ranks, I mean... When
did Gallant write her letter?

1984
01:36:33,504 --> 01:36:34,654
1984.

1985
01:36:34,704 --> 01:36:35,854
And Law just ignored it.

1986
01:36:35,884 --> 01:36:37,584
How do you ignore
that freaking letter?

1987
01:36:37,734 --> 01:36:38,754
We've got him.

1988
01:36:39,324 --> 01:36:41,254
You can't read this letters
and think anything else.

1989
01:36:41,364 --> 01:36:42,364
It's proof.

1990
01:36:42,365 --> 01:36:43,874
Yeah, it is.

1991
01:36:44,584 --> 01:36:46,164
This is good work.

1992
01:36:46,784 --> 01:36:48,164
Should we take it up to Ben?

1993
01:36:50,324 --> 01:36:51,944
No, not yet.

1994
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:53,644
Why not?

1995
01:36:54,064 --> 01:36:55,484
We got Law. This is it.

1996
01:36:55,524 --> 01:36:58,254
No, this is Law covering
for one priest.

1997
01:36:58,284 --> 01:36:59,614
There's other 90 out there.

1998
01:36:59,784 --> 01:37:01,514
Yeah, we'll print that
story when we get it.

1999
01:37:01,654 --> 01:37:02,924
But we got to go with this now.

2000
01:37:02,944 --> 01:37:04,974
No, I'm not gonna rush
this story, Mike.

2001
01:37:05,014 --> 01:37:06,304
But we don't have a choice, Robby.

2002
01:37:06,344 --> 01:37:09,904
If we don't rush to print somebody
else is gonna find this letters...

2003
01:37:09,924 --> 01:37:11,064
and butcher the story.

2004
01:37:11,084 --> 01:37:13,804
John Quinby from The Herald was
at the freaking courthouse.

2005
01:37:14,014 --> 01:37:15,604
So we'll write a holding story...

2006
01:37:15,634 --> 01:37:17,194
and we'll keep our
eye on The Herald.

2007
01:37:17,214 --> 01:37:18,414
- Keep our eye on The Herald?
- Yeah.

2008
01:37:18,415 --> 01:37:19,924
If they run this and
they get it wrong...

2009
01:37:19,944 --> 01:37:21,084
the Church will bury it.

2010
01:37:21,144 --> 01:37:22,184
We got to do this now.

2011
01:37:22,214 --> 01:37:23,334
Mike, Mike.

2012
01:37:23,354 --> 01:37:25,034
What? Why are we hesitating?

2013
01:37:25,294 --> 01:37:27,284
Baron told us to get
Law. This is Law.

2014
01:37:27,324 --> 01:37:29,514
Baron told us to get the system.

2015
01:37:29,554 --> 01:37:31,014
We need the full scope.

2016
01:37:31,334 --> 01:37:33,454
That's the only thing that
will put an end on this.

2017
01:37:33,474 --> 01:37:35,214
Then let's take it up to
Ben and let him decide.

2018
01:37:35,434 --> 01:37:37,564
We'll take to Ben
when I say it's time.

2019
01:37:37,584 --> 01:37:39,824
It's time, Robby. It's time.

2020
01:37:41,244 --> 01:37:43,944
They knew and they
let it happen...

2021
01:37:43,984 --> 01:37:46,324
to kids. Ok?

2022
01:37:46,584 --> 01:37:48,124
It could have been you,
It could have been me.

2023
01:37:48,174 --> 01:37:49,734
It could have been any of us.

2024
01:37:50,984 --> 01:37:52,624
We gotta nail these scumbags.

2025
01:37:52,644 --> 01:37:53,814
We gotta show people...

2026
01:37:53,994 --> 01:37:55,974
that nobody can get
away with this.

2027
01:37:56,064 --> 01:37:59,024
Not a priest or a Cardinal,
or a freaking Pope.

2028
01:38:02,034 --> 01:38:04,864
- You finished?
- Yeah, I am.

2029
01:38:05,664 --> 01:38:06,894
This is bullshit.

2030
01:38:36,864 --> 01:38:37,864
You ok?

2031
01:38:48,114 --> 01:38:51,284
- Hi Hansi.
- Hard day at work, Mike?

2032
01:38:56,654 --> 01:38:57,714
- Here.
- Thank you.

2033
01:38:59,154 --> 01:39:01,834
I don't know why I got
so pissed off, you know.

2034
01:39:01,954 --> 01:39:03,034
I think Robby is wrong.

2035
01:39:03,094 --> 01:39:05,264
You know, you just...

2036
01:39:05,394 --> 01:39:07,114
You care about the
story, Mike. We all do.

2037
01:39:08,994 --> 01:39:10,284
Yeah, I guess.

2038
01:39:13,904 --> 01:39:15,684
I stopped going to
Church with my Nana.

2039
01:39:17,804 --> 01:39:21,044
It was... It was
to hard, you know.

2040
01:39:21,174 --> 01:39:22,404
I'd be sitting there and I...

2041
01:39:22,414 --> 01:39:24,704
I would start thinking
about Joe Crowley...

2042
01:39:24,734 --> 01:39:26,424
or someone else and I just...

2043
01:39:26,934 --> 01:39:28,424
I just got so angry.

2044
01:39:29,584 --> 01:39:31,684
Did you, did you tell her why?

2045
01:39:32,704 --> 01:39:35,164
She goes to Church 3
times a week, Mike.

2046
01:39:40,294 --> 01:39:41,834
It really pisses me off.

2047
01:39:43,534 --> 01:39:44,664
Yeah.

2048
01:39:46,604 --> 01:39:49,574
I actually really liked going to
Church when I was a little kid.

2049
01:39:51,644 --> 01:39:53,294
Why did you stop?

2050
01:39:53,344 --> 01:39:54,694
Typical shit.

2051
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:57,984
But the weird thing is, is...

2052
01:40:01,684 --> 01:40:02,904
I think I...

2053
01:40:04,084 --> 01:40:06,004
I think I figured that
maybe one day I would...

2054
01:40:08,724 --> 01:40:10,734
I would actually go back.

2055
01:40:12,724 --> 01:40:14,724
I really, I was
holding on to that.

2056
01:40:17,434 --> 01:40:19,264
Then I read those letters and...

2057
01:40:20,834 --> 01:40:22,464
And something's just...

2058
01:40:23,464 --> 01:40:24,764
cracked.

2059
01:40:26,174 --> 01:40:28,234
- It's a shitty feeling.
- Yeah.

2060
01:40:29,674 --> 01:40:31,234
It's a shitty feeling.

2061
01:40:35,614 --> 01:40:37,644
- Looks like a long day.
- Hey Pete.

2062
01:40:37,664 --> 01:40:39,304
I'm sorry to make it longer.

2063
01:40:40,094 --> 01:40:41,094
Brian...

2064
01:40:42,424 --> 01:40:44,644
Does anyone ever said no
to a drink with you, Pete.

2065
01:40:45,864 --> 01:40:47,154
Well sure.

2066
01:40:47,564 --> 01:40:49,354
The trick is to keep asking.

2067
01:40:49,834 --> 01:40:51,824
- For Boston.
- For Boston.

2068
01:40:54,974 --> 01:40:57,504
So... You're here
for the Cardinal?

2069
01:40:57,674 --> 01:41:00,404
No, no, no. I wouldn't.

2070
01:41:00,514 --> 01:41:03,224
I wouldn't presume to speak
for the Cardinal, you know.

2071
01:41:04,754 --> 01:41:05,774
You know?

2072
01:41:06,384 --> 01:41:08,564
You got a lot of people
here respect you, Robby.

2073
01:41:08,604 --> 01:41:10,284
- Yeah.
- With work you do.

2074
01:41:10,924 --> 01:41:12,204
That's good to know.

2075
01:41:12,224 --> 01:41:13,994
You know, it's cause you
care about this place.

2076
01:41:14,194 --> 01:41:15,194
Yeah.

2077
01:41:15,195 --> 01:41:16,774
It's why you do what you
do, it's who you are.

2078
01:41:17,664 --> 01:41:19,884
But people need the Church

2079
01:41:20,764 --> 01:41:22,584
more than ever right now.

2080
01:41:23,364 --> 01:41:24,894
You know, you can feel it.

2081
01:41:25,364 --> 01:41:26,814
And the Cardinal...

2082
01:41:28,634 --> 01:41:31,474
You know, the Cardinal,
he may not be perfect...

2083
01:41:31,964 --> 01:41:34,194
but we can't throw out
all the good he's doing

2084
01:41:34,204 --> 01:41:35,724
over a few bad apples.

2085
01:41:37,584 --> 01:41:39,173
You know, I'm bringing
this up to you...

2086
01:41:39,174 --> 01:41:42,274
because I know this is
Baron's idea. His agenda.

2087
01:41:43,284 --> 01:41:45,364
I gotta tell you, honest
to God, I mean...

2088
01:41:45,384 --> 01:41:47,454
He doesn't care about
this city the way we do.

2089
01:41:48,694 --> 01:41:49,814
I mean, how could he?

2090
01:41:56,534 --> 01:41:58,826
This is how it happens,
isn't it, Pete?

2091
01:41:58,827 --> 01:41:59,827
What's that?

2092
01:41:59,874 --> 01:42:02,584
Guy leans on the guy
and suddenly...

2093
01:42:02,614 --> 01:42:04,844
the whole town just
looks the other way.

2094
01:42:07,144 --> 01:42:08,314
Robby, Robby...

2095
01:42:09,574 --> 01:42:10,624
Look it...

2096
01:42:11,574 --> 01:42:13,924
Marty Baron is just
trying to make his mark.

2097
01:42:14,344 --> 01:42:15,874
He's gonna be here for
a couple of years...

2098
01:42:15,994 --> 01:42:17,504
and he's gonna move on,

2099
01:42:17,534 --> 01:42:19,804
just like he did in
New York and Miami.

2100
01:42:21,794 --> 01:42:23,114
Where are you gonna go?

2101
01:42:28,664 --> 01:42:30,734
Good night, Robby. Brian.

2102
01:42:32,034 --> 01:42:34,464
- Hey Pete?
- Yeah.

2103
01:42:36,634 --> 01:42:38,554
When we do run the story,

2104
01:42:38,914 --> 01:42:41,174
I'm gonna need a comment
from the Cardinal.

2105
01:42:43,314 --> 01:42:45,874
We'll talk again later.
Good night, Robby.

2106
01:42:45,884 --> 01:42:46,904
Good night, Pete.

2107
01:42:57,764 --> 01:42:58,764
Robby.

2108
01:43:00,634 --> 01:43:01,774
What?

2109
01:43:02,434 --> 01:43:04,174
No shit. When?

2110
01:43:06,604 --> 01:43:08,514
Ok. Yeah.

2111
01:43:11,774 --> 01:43:12,774
Hey...

2112
01:43:13,914 --> 01:43:14,914
What's up?

2113
01:43:16,314 --> 01:43:18,384
Sweeney ruled in our favour.

2114
01:43:18,514 --> 01:43:20,584
She ruled to unseal the documents.

2115
01:43:22,314 --> 01:43:23,314
Jesus.

2116
01:43:27,454 --> 01:43:29,044
Church has already
filed an appeal...

2117
01:43:29,074 --> 01:43:30,624
but the trial Court of ruling...

2118
01:43:30,644 --> 01:43:32,624
is generally upheld
in this matters.

2119
01:43:32,814 --> 01:43:34,754
And when do we get the documents?

2120
01:43:35,364 --> 01:43:37,724
Probably takes Cohen a
few weeks to rule...

2121
01:43:37,914 --> 01:43:39,574
and then there's a
redaction process.

2122
01:43:40,234 --> 01:43:43,034
I'd say it would be made
public, mid January.

2123
01:43:44,104 --> 01:43:45,104
- Ok.
- Alright.

2124
01:43:45,224 --> 01:43:46,364
- Thanks Jon.
- You bet.

2125
01:43:46,574 --> 01:43:47,894
- Nice work.
- Thanks.

2126
01:43:48,474 --> 01:43:50,094
Metro should run something, Marty.

2127
01:43:50,474 --> 01:43:52,094
We can't run this one big.

2128
01:43:52,684 --> 01:43:53,864
Why wouldn't we?

2129
01:43:53,884 --> 01:43:55,614
It's a major First
Amendment victory.

2130
01:43:55,684 --> 01:43:57,834
Not to mention you got an
Irish catholic Judge...

2131
01:43:57,864 --> 01:43:59,304
ruling against the Church.

2132
01:43:59,424 --> 01:44:00,854
That's a hell of a precedent.

2133
01:44:01,424 --> 01:44:03,854
We don't want the Herald
going deep on this.

2134
01:44:04,584 --> 01:44:05,704
Why is that?

2135
01:44:08,064 --> 01:44:09,674
You're gonna have
to step out, Peter.

2136
01:44:10,014 --> 01:44:11,274
I'm not stepping out.

2137
01:44:20,174 --> 01:44:21,244
Peter...

2138
01:44:35,824 --> 01:44:38,044
- When did you...?
- Couple of weeks ago.

2139
01:44:38,124 --> 01:44:39,253
Couple of weeks?

2140
01:44:39,254 --> 01:44:40,254
Yeah.

2141
01:44:40,264 --> 01:44:42,804
- And you're telling us now?
- These are substantial.

2142
01:44:44,064 --> 01:44:46,394
It clearly shows that
Law was negligent.

2143
01:44:47,234 --> 01:44:49,634
I need more time. I
wanna keep digging.

2144
01:44:49,974 --> 01:44:51,314
For what? This is
the goddamn story.

2145
01:44:51,374 --> 01:44:52,714
It's not the whole story.

2146
01:44:52,804 --> 01:44:54,314
Tough shit, we're on a clock now.

2147
01:44:54,704 --> 01:44:56,184
Even if we don't run
Sweeney's rulings...

2148
01:44:56,224 --> 01:44:58,344
another paper could find this
letters and fuck the story.

2149
01:44:58,384 --> 01:44:59,474
Agreed.

2150
01:44:59,504 --> 01:45:00,834
But we run these letters alone...

2151
01:45:00,844 --> 01:45:02,764
Law apologises, says
it's one time thing...

2152
01:45:02,784 --> 01:45:04,084
and he can bury it.

2153
01:45:04,254 --> 01:45:05,844
How? This clearly show he knew...

2154
01:45:05,874 --> 01:45:07,034
and did nothing about it.

2155
01:45:07,054 --> 01:45:10,084
Look, I'm close to
stories on 70 priests.

2156
01:45:10,554 --> 01:45:13,454
We nail that along
with those letters...

2157
01:45:13,484 --> 01:45:16,144
this is proof that this
is bigger than Law.

2158
01:45:17,104 --> 01:45:18,354
This is the whole system.

2159
01:45:19,324 --> 01:45:20,844
Your multiple sources...

2160
01:45:20,854 --> 01:45:22,584
confirming all those priests?

2161
01:45:22,724 --> 01:45:24,344
Some. I'll get more.

2162
01:45:24,744 --> 01:45:26,794
Too risky. If we're
not buttoned up...

2163
01:45:26,804 --> 01:45:29,084
on every single one of them the
Church will pick us apart.

2164
01:45:31,014 --> 01:45:33,404
I think I can get us someone
from the other side of the isle.

2165
01:45:33,654 --> 01:45:35,354
Somebody inside the Church?

2166
01:45:36,054 --> 01:45:37,454
Yeah, a lawyer.

2167
01:45:37,954 --> 01:45:39,224
Will he go on the record?

2168
01:45:40,154 --> 01:45:42,584
Deep background, but
he's a solid source.

2169
01:45:46,324 --> 01:45:48,584
Rezendes needs time
to write the story.

2170
01:45:48,874 --> 01:45:50,208
We don't want to drop
it on Christmass...

2171
01:45:50,209 --> 01:45:51,339
not after the 9/11.

2172
01:45:52,534 --> 01:45:54,684
We can run it just
after New Years.

2173
01:45:54,874 --> 01:45:57,044
Before they release the
rest of the documents.

2174
01:46:00,974 --> 01:46:01,974
Alright.

2175
01:46:03,144 --> 01:46:05,714
Tell Canellos to bury
the ruling in Metro.

2176
01:46:07,614 --> 01:46:10,504
- You got six weeks.
- Thank you.

2177
01:46:11,854 --> 01:46:13,844
Tell Mike I want a
draught by Christmass.

2178
01:46:13,845 --> 01:46:15,649
And we need a response
from Lake Street.

2179
01:46:15,650 --> 01:46:16,650
Yeah.

2180
01:46:16,654 --> 01:46:17,664
Who does PR for the Cardinal?

2181
01:46:17,774 --> 01:46:18,774
Still John Walsh?

2182
01:46:18,775 --> 01:46:20,113
No, somebody new. Donna Morrissey.

2183
01:46:20,114 --> 01:46:21,634
She came from TV. She's young.

2184
01:46:21,794 --> 01:46:23,446
Good, get a quote.
We need something

2185
01:46:23,447 --> 01:46:24,874
from Law to appear even-handed.

2186
01:46:24,904 --> 01:46:27,104
Robby, next time give
me a goddamn heads up.

2187
01:46:27,374 --> 01:46:28,374
Will do.

2188
01:47:51,824 --> 01:47:53,904
Robby, what a nice surprise.

2189
01:47:54,424 --> 01:47:55,604
Come on in.

2190
01:48:02,734 --> 01:48:05,534
Hey Hun... Look who
I found outside.

2191
01:48:08,604 --> 01:48:10,214
Karen, can you give us a minute?

2192
01:48:12,144 --> 01:48:15,104
- Sure.
- Good to see you, Karen.

2193
01:48:18,484 --> 01:48:19,484
What's up?

2194
01:48:34,664 --> 01:48:35,984
I'm out of time, Jim.

2195
01:48:37,304 --> 01:48:40,344
We got cover-up stories
on 70 priests.

2196
01:48:40,674 --> 01:48:42,584
But the boss is not
gonna run it...

2197
01:48:42,634 --> 01:48:45,084
unless I got confirmation
from your side.

2198
01:48:47,044 --> 01:48:48,954
Are you out of your mind?

2199
01:48:48,984 --> 01:48:51,464
Come on. This is our town, Jimmy.

2200
01:48:51,714 --> 01:48:53,904
Everybody knew something
was going on.

2201
01:48:54,214 --> 01:48:55,504
And no one did a thing.

2202
01:48:56,414 --> 01:48:58,174
We got to put an end to it.

2203
01:48:58,204 --> 01:48:59,924
Don't tell me what I got to do.

2204
01:49:00,524 --> 01:49:02,294
Yeah, I helped defend
this scumbags,

2205
01:49:02,404 --> 01:49:04,034
but that's my job, Robby.

2206
01:49:04,284 --> 01:49:06,034
I was doing my job.

2207
01:49:06,964 --> 01:49:08,074
Yeah.

2208
01:49:09,434 --> 01:49:11,044
You and everyone else.

2209
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:21,434
Get out of my house.

2210
01:49:32,424 --> 01:49:33,424
Hey.

2211
01:49:35,524 --> 01:49:38,744
You come to my home and
lay this shit on me?

2212
01:49:38,934 --> 01:49:40,514
You were right, Robby.

2213
01:49:41,034 --> 01:49:43,944
We all knew something
was going on.

2214
01:49:43,984 --> 01:49:45,524
So where were you?

2215
01:49:46,884 --> 01:49:48,224
What took you so long?

2216
01:49:54,814 --> 01:49:56,194
I don't know, Jim.

2217
01:50:01,554 --> 01:50:02,764
Give me the list.

2218
01:50:59,504 --> 01:51:00,773
Larry, we're gonna
press in 6 hours.

2219
01:51:00,774 --> 01:51:03,554
Donna Morrissey said she'd call
us with quote from Law hours ago.

2220
01:51:03,594 --> 01:51:05,654
- That's what I thought.
- Where did you talk to her?

2221
01:51:05,874 --> 01:51:07,044
Ok, Ok.

2222
01:51:07,874 --> 01:51:10,044
Yeah, yeah that's good to know.

2223
01:51:10,384 --> 01:51:12,574
- Thanks Pete.
- Anything?

2224
01:51:12,924 --> 01:51:14,874
Conley said that Donna
Morrissey should have called,

2225
01:51:14,884 --> 01:51:15,884
he just left Lake Street.

2226
01:51:15,924 --> 01:51:17,864
Yeah. Rasky said the same thing.

2227
01:51:17,883 --> 01:51:18,883
This Yes ridiculous.

2228
01:51:18,884 --> 01:51:20,374
You think they wanna
get ahead on this.

2229
01:51:20,384 --> 01:51:22,034
I mean they be idiots not to.

2230
01:51:22,194 --> 01:51:25,704
I would love to see their faces
when they read this thing man.

2231
01:51:25,724 --> 01:51:27,674
You know Sunday's the
Feast of the Epiphany?

2232
01:51:28,334 --> 01:51:29,334
Seems appropriate.

2233
01:51:35,774 --> 01:51:36,884
Mike Rezendes.

2234
01:51:38,744 --> 01:51:39,744
Hey Donna.

2235
01:51:40,103 --> 01:51:41,103
Thanks for calling.

2236
01:51:41,104 --> 01:51:43,304
Yeah. I just had a few questions
if you have a minute.

2237
01:51:46,024 --> 01:51:47,534
What?

2238
01:51:48,554 --> 01:51:50,924
- What?
- Other adjective.

2239
01:51:52,824 --> 01:51:55,064
- Anything?
- Law just turned us down.

2240
01:51:55,084 --> 01:51:56,144
Jesus Christ.

2241
01:51:56,384 --> 01:51:58,044
I just got of the phone
with Donna Morrissey...

2242
01:51:58,064 --> 01:51:59,984
she said, quote "we
don't even want..."

2243
01:51:59,994 --> 01:52:01,214
to know what the questions are".

2244
01:52:01,234 --> 01:52:03,074
- End quote.
- Did she really said that?

2245
01:52:03,134 --> 01:52:05,064
- Yeah.
- Well, that oughta do it.

2246
01:52:05,344 --> 01:52:07,504
The Church had no
interests in knowing...

2247
01:52:07,514 --> 01:52:09,654
what the Globe's
questions would be.

2248
01:52:11,144 --> 01:52:13,544
Work it in somewhere before
the jump. Anything else?

2249
01:52:13,744 --> 01:52:16,503
Matt wants to put the letters
online, so that the readers...

2250
01:52:16,504 --> 01:52:17,504
can see for themselves.

2251
01:52:17,534 --> 01:52:19,964
We can run the URL at the
bottom of the article.

2252
01:52:20,184 --> 01:52:21,864
- It's pretty straightforward.
- Ok.

2253
01:52:21,894 --> 01:52:24,024
We also put the Spotlight tip
line at the end of the story...

2254
01:52:24,064 --> 01:52:25,514
so people can call in.

2255
01:52:25,524 --> 01:52:26,924
It goes directly to our office.

2256
01:52:26,954 --> 01:52:28,184
Matt and I can go
in the morning...

2257
01:52:28,194 --> 01:52:29,414
in case we get any calls.

2258
01:52:29,444 --> 01:52:31,484
I'm more concerned about
the phones at reception.

2259
01:52:31,504 --> 01:52:32,914
After we ran the Porter case,

2260
01:52:32,994 --> 01:52:34,514
the message centre were
tied up for weeks.

2261
01:52:35,674 --> 01:52:37,754
There were picketers
too. Lots of them.

2262
01:52:37,974 --> 01:52:40,434
I'll talk to Richard about
the security and the phones.

2263
01:52:41,174 --> 01:52:43,324
How are we coming
on the folo story?

2264
01:52:44,114 --> 01:52:46,714
Well we've now done multiple
stories on 70 priests.

2265
01:52:47,854 --> 01:52:48,954
All 70?

2266
01:52:49,054 --> 01:52:51,073
And with confirmation
from Robby's source,

2267
01:52:51,074 --> 01:52:52,074
we are ready to go.

2268
01:52:52,134 --> 01:52:53,504
We can have a draught next week.

2269
01:52:53,634 --> 01:52:55,904
Robby, that source of yours,

2270
01:52:55,914 --> 01:52:57,604
is it something we could revisit?

2271
01:52:59,994 --> 01:53:00,994
It might be tough.

2272
01:53:01,134 --> 01:53:02,524
But he has no problem helping...

2273
01:53:02,534 --> 01:53:04,464
the Church protect
dozens of dirty priests.

2274
01:53:04,561 --> 01:53:05,561
Guy is a scumbag.

2275
01:53:05,562 --> 01:53:07,474
He's a lawyer, he's doing his job.

2276
01:53:07,494 --> 01:53:09,824
- He's a shill for the Church.
- He knew and he did nothing.

2277
01:53:09,934 --> 01:53:12,044
He could have said something years
ago. Maybe save some lives.

2278
01:53:12,304 --> 01:53:13,304
What about us?

2279
01:53:15,114 --> 01:53:16,444
What's that supposed to mean?

2280
01:53:16,514 --> 01:53:17,944
We had all the pieces.

2281
01:53:18,544 --> 01:53:20,244
Why didn't we get it sooner?

2282
01:53:20,263 --> 01:53:21,263
We didn't have all the pieces.

2283
01:53:21,264 --> 01:53:24,244
We had Saviano, we had
Barrett, we had Geoghan.

2284
01:53:24,534 --> 01:53:26,204
We had the directories
in the basement.

2285
01:53:26,354 --> 01:53:27,544
You know what, we got it now.

2286
01:53:27,564 --> 01:53:29,784
Robby, this story
needed Spotlight.

2287
01:53:30,304 --> 01:53:32,744
Mike, Spotlight's been
around since 1970.

2288
01:53:32,874 --> 01:53:34,704
So what? We couldn't see...

2289
01:53:34,724 --> 01:53:36,104
the scope of this. No one could.

2290
01:53:36,134 --> 01:53:38,224
Robby, this started with
one goddamn priest.

2291
01:53:41,174 --> 01:53:44,154
Macleish sent us a letter
of 20 priests years ago.

2292
01:53:44,174 --> 01:53:45,454
Sacha found a clip.

2293
01:53:46,644 --> 01:53:48,214
Are you freaking kidding
me? 20 priests?

2294
01:53:48,744 --> 01:53:49,744
When?

2295
01:53:51,214 --> 01:53:53,614
Just after Porter.
December of '93.

2296
01:53:53,904 --> 01:53:56,944
We buried the story
in Metro. No folo.

2297
01:53:58,104 --> 01:53:59,544
That was you.

2298
01:54:01,354 --> 01:54:02,444
You were Metro.

2299
01:54:03,324 --> 01:54:05,454
Yeah. That was me.

2300
01:54:05,564 --> 01:54:08,454
I'd just taken over. I
don't remember it at all.

2301
01:54:10,234 --> 01:54:11,234
But yeah.

2302
01:54:16,404 --> 01:54:18,964
Can I say something here?

2303
01:54:20,714 --> 01:54:22,684
Sometimes it's easy to forget...

2304
01:54:22,694 --> 01:54:23,794
that we spend most of our time...

2305
01:54:23,814 --> 01:54:25,794
stumbling around the dark.

2306
01:54:26,084 --> 01:54:28,504
Suddenly a light gets
turned on and...

2307
01:54:28,514 --> 01:54:31,244
there's a fair share
of blame to go around.

2308
01:54:32,744 --> 01:54:34,254
I can't speak to what happened...

2309
01:54:34,264 --> 01:54:35,964
before I arrived, but...

2310
01:54:36,524 --> 01:54:39,374
All of you have done some
very good reporting here,

2311
01:54:40,464 --> 01:54:42,414
reporting that I believe
is gonna have...

2312
01:54:42,454 --> 01:54:44,934
an immediate and
considerable impact...

2313
01:54:44,954 --> 01:54:46,344
on our readers.

2314
01:54:48,204 --> 01:54:51,744
For me, This kind of
story is why we do this.

2315
01:54:52,304 --> 01:54:54,153
Having said that,
Cardinal Law and...

2316
01:54:54,154 --> 01:54:55,853
the catholic community
are gonna have...

2317
01:54:55,854 --> 01:54:57,694
a very strong response to this.

2318
01:54:58,804 --> 01:55:02,954
So if you need a moment,
you've earned it.

2319
01:55:03,554 --> 01:55:08,434
But, I will need you back here
Monday morning, focused...

2320
01:55:09,024 --> 01:55:10,564
and ready to do your job.

2321
01:55:19,304 --> 01:55:21,774
- Leaving?
- Yeah.

2322
01:55:27,814 --> 01:55:30,634
I just got a call
from the Cardinal.

2323
01:55:30,674 --> 01:55:32,334
Really? Why?

2324
01:55:32,344 --> 01:55:36,454
He wanted to tell me personally he
had decided not to comment and...

2325
01:55:36,784 --> 01:55:40,664
He said he wanted to,
extend me that courtesy.

2326
01:55:40,684 --> 01:55:43,724
Jesus, the balls on that
guy. What did you say?

2327
01:55:44,154 --> 01:55:45,757
I told him he was
making mistake and

2328
01:55:45,758 --> 01:55:47,144
that we're gonna run the story.

2329
01:55:47,494 --> 01:55:49,164
Damn right we're gonna run it.

2330
01:56:14,454 --> 01:56:17,524
Sacha, can I have
a drink of water?

2331
01:56:17,564 --> 01:56:19,974
Yeah, sure Nana. Yeah.

2332
01:56:31,344 --> 01:56:32,344
Can I keep this?

2333
01:56:33,924 --> 01:56:35,374
Sure.

2334
01:56:35,924 --> 01:56:37,374
I thought you should see it first.

2335
01:56:37,984 --> 01:56:39,134
Thank you for bringing it by.

2336
01:56:42,454 --> 01:56:44,864
Now I have some plans
I have to attend to.

2337
01:57:03,074 --> 01:57:04,524
Both kids were abused.

2338
01:57:04,724 --> 01:57:06,844
Jamaica Plain two weeks ago.

2339
01:57:09,214 --> 01:57:12,854
Keep... Doing your
work, Mr Rezendes.

2340
01:57:14,584 --> 01:57:16,394
Hello.

2341
01:57:16,814 --> 01:57:18,274
How are you guys doing?

2342
01:57:19,684 --> 01:57:21,074
Good...

2343
01:57:44,314 --> 01:57:47,444
Church allowed abuse
by priest for years.

2344
01:58:07,374 --> 01:58:09,504
- Hey.
- Good morning.

2345
01:58:10,234 --> 01:58:13,904
- How did you sleep?
- Not very well. You?

2346
01:58:14,004 --> 01:58:15,494
I haven't slept well for months.

2347
01:58:18,174 --> 01:58:19,904
I've actually started writing.

2348
01:58:20,303 --> 01:58:21,303
Writing?

2349
01:58:21,304 --> 01:58:22,714
Yeah. I'm working on a book.

2350
01:58:22,734 --> 01:58:24,544
Gives me something
else to focus on.

2351
01:58:24,684 --> 01:58:26,024
What kind of book?

2352
01:58:26,384 --> 01:58:27,384
Horror.

2353
01:58:34,594 --> 01:58:35,594
Spotlight?

2354
01:58:37,034 --> 01:58:38,874
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

2355
01:58:39,234 --> 01:58:40,874
Can I get your name please?

2356
01:58:57,754 --> 01:59:00,404
- You do know it's Sunday, right?
- Couldn't get a tee time.

2357
01:59:03,894 --> 01:59:04,904
No picketers.

2358
01:59:05,204 --> 01:59:07,864
Yeah. Well they're
still at Church.

2359
01:59:10,494 --> 01:59:13,054
Hey Linda. It's quiet, huh?

2360
01:59:13,084 --> 01:59:15,444
Yeah. Easiest
overtime I ever made,

2361
01:59:15,574 --> 01:59:17,074
Phone hasn't rang once.

2362
01:59:17,304 --> 01:59:19,394
Matty send two of mine
down to Spotlight.

2363
01:59:23,144 --> 01:59:24,374
- Great article guys.

2364
01:59:24,414 --> 01:59:26,674

01:59:57,544 --> 01:59:59,534
- Mike, can you grab that?
- Yeah, yeah.

2369
02:00:00,844 --> 02:00:02,634
They're almost all victims, Robby.

2370
02:00:05,124 --> 02:00:06,124
I'm sorry...

2371
02:00:06,204 --> 02:00:07,484

02:00:08,134 --> 02:00:09,164
