1
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,295
What the hell...?
Goddamn son-of-a-bitch...

2
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,311
What the hell...?

3
00:05:19,908 --> 00:05:21,785
Hey, my turn.

4
00:05:30,502 --> 00:05:34,172
Hey, what's wrong with this picture?

5
00:05:42,055 --> 00:05:44,182
Nice night for a walk, eh?

6
00:05:48,895 --> 00:05:50,230
Nice night for a walk.

7
00:05:51,314 --> 00:05:55,568
Wash day tomorrow.
Nothing clean, right?

8
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:57,278
Nothing clean. Right.

9
00:05:57,445 --> 00:06:00,490
I think this guy's a couple
of cans short of a six-pack.

10
00:06:00,657 --> 00:06:05,328
Your clothes, give them to me. Now.

11
00:06:05,495 --> 00:06:06,996
Fuck you, asshole.

12
00:07:50,725 --> 00:07:54,729
Hey, buddy, did you just see
a real bright light?

13
00:07:57,482 --> 00:07:58,858
See that guy?

14
00:07:59,025 --> 00:08:00,109
Hold it right there.

15
00:08:00,276 --> 00:08:02,111
- He's rabbiting.
- Hey! I said hold it!

16
00:08:02,278 --> 00:08:04,197
Go!

17
00:08:04,989 --> 00:08:07,951
That son-of-a-bitch took my pants.

18
00:08:51,828 --> 00:08:54,831
- What day is it? The date.
- 12th May.

19
00:08:54,998 --> 00:08:56,791
- Thursday.
- What year?

20
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:12,307
He's got my gun. Let's go.

21
00:12:07,565 --> 00:12:09,901
Guard it for me, Big Buns.

22
00:12:13,362 --> 00:12:15,364
Hi. I'm late.

23
00:12:16,324 --> 00:12:17,950
So am I.

24
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,454
- I'm in it.
- So am I.

25
00:13:09,293 --> 00:13:12,171
- Honey, can I have that coffee now?
- Yes, sir.

26
00:13:13,256 --> 00:13:15,716
- OK. Who gets the burly-beef?
- I ordered barbecued.

27
00:13:15,883 --> 00:13:17,927
I think that's mine,
but I didn't order fries.

28
00:13:18,094 --> 00:13:20,805
- Mine's the chili beef deluxe.
- OK, who gets the burly-beef?

29
00:13:20,972 --> 00:13:23,641
- Miss, we're ready to order now.
- Yes, ma'am.

30
00:13:23,808 --> 00:13:25,893
- Ah!
- Oh!

31
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,812
I'm so sorry.

32
00:13:30,982 --> 00:13:32,858
This isn't real leather, is it?

33
00:13:36,153 --> 00:13:39,323
Nice going, kid.
I ought to give you the tip.

34
00:13:41,617 --> 00:13:44,495
Look at it this way.
In 100 years, who's gonna care?

35
00:13:52,878 --> 00:13:55,047
The 12-gauge auto-loader.

36
00:13:57,174 --> 00:14:01,053
That's Italian. You can go pump or auto.

37
00:14:02,013 --> 00:14:04,765
The .45 long slide with laser sighting.

38
00:14:04,932 --> 00:14:08,227
These are new. We just got them in.
That's a good gun.

39
00:14:08,936 --> 00:14:10,688
Just touch the trigger,
the beam comes on,

40
00:14:10,855 --> 00:14:12,690
and you put the red dot where
you want the bullet to go.

41
00:14:12,857 --> 00:14:14,358
You can't miss.

42
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,364
- Anything else?
- Plasma rifle in the 40-watt range.

43
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:22,158
Hey, just what you see, pal.

44
00:14:23,451 --> 00:14:24,702
The Uzi nine millimeter.

45
00:14:26,245 --> 00:14:28,497
You know your weapons, buddy.

46
00:14:28,664 --> 00:14:30,833
Any one of these
is ideal for home defense.

47
00:14:32,043 --> 00:14:35,046
So which will it be?

48
00:14:35,212 --> 00:14:38,716
- All.
- I may close early today.

49
00:14:38,883 --> 00:14:43,220
It's a 15-day wait on the handguns,
but the rifles you can take now.

50
00:14:44,388 --> 00:14:46,390
- You can't do that.
- Wrong.

51
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:16,212
Hi, baby. Yeah, yeah, it's me.

52
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:20,675
Listen, I need you to come pick me up.
My bike just broke down.

53
00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:23,010
I don't care what you're doing.
Come and get me. What the...?

54
00:15:25,096 --> 00:15:28,891
Hey, man, you got
a serious attitude problem.

55
00:16:21,986 --> 00:16:24,321
- Sarah Connor?
- Yes?

56
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,378
I'm on my break, Chuck.
Carla's got my station.

57
00:16:39,545 --> 00:16:42,923
Sarah, come here.
It's about you. I mean, sort of.

58
00:16:45,468 --> 00:16:49,597
So incredible. You're not gonna believe this.
Sit, you're going to love this.

59
00:16:49,764 --> 00:16:50,723
Sh!

60
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:54,018
- What?
- ...compiled from several witnesses.

61
00:16:54,185 --> 00:16:57,354
Once again, Sarah Connor,
35, mother of two,

62
00:16:57,521 --> 00:16:59,857
brutally shot to death
in her home this afternoon.

63
00:17:00,024 --> 00:17:01,817
You're dead, honey.

64
00:20:15,219 --> 00:20:17,221
...if you're into sound,

65
00:20:17,388 --> 00:20:21,725
for the greatest sound around,
come to Bob's Stereo at 2500 Sepulveda.

66
00:20:21,892 --> 00:20:26,105
We've got woofers, tweeters,
the newest in audio and compact discs.

67
00:20:26,271 --> 00:20:28,691
We've got graphic equalizers
and sound balancers that...

68
00:20:53,132 --> 00:20:54,591
Sorry.

69
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,439
Hello?

70
00:21:08,605 --> 00:21:12,651
First I'm gonna rip
the buttons off your blouse one by one,

71
00:21:12,818 --> 00:21:17,239
then run my tongue down your neck
to your bare, gleaming breasts.

72
00:21:17,406 --> 00:21:23,120
And then slowly... slowly pull
your jeans of finch by inch.

73
00:21:23,871 --> 00:21:26,040
Ginger, it's Matt.

74
00:21:26,206 --> 00:21:30,127
And lick your belly in circles
further and further down,

75
00:21:30,294 --> 00:21:33,547
and then pull your
panties off with my teeth.

76
00:21:33,714 --> 00:21:35,007
Who is this?

77
00:21:36,633 --> 00:21:38,469
God. Sarah?

78
00:21:40,137 --> 00:21:42,389
Jesus. I'm sorry.

79
00:21:42,556 --> 00:21:45,350
I thought you were...
Can I talk to Ginger, please?

80
00:21:46,101 --> 00:21:46,977
Sure.

81
00:21:47,144 --> 00:21:49,146
Oh!

82
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,315
It's the creep.

83
00:21:52,983 --> 00:21:53,984
Hello?

84
00:21:54,151 --> 00:21:57,571
First I'll rip the buttons off
your blouse one by one...

85
00:21:59,615 --> 00:22:04,620
You fucking pigs! Wait till I get
my hands on you. Get off me!

86
00:22:06,622 --> 00:22:07,873
Ed.

87
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:12,211
- What have you got?
- Dead girl.

88
00:22:12,377 --> 00:22:15,881
- I can see that.
- Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35.

89
00:22:16,048 --> 00:22:19,885
Shot six times at less than ten feet.
Large caliber weapon.

90
00:22:20,052 --> 00:22:21,845
You know, these work.

91
00:22:23,222 --> 00:22:25,891
- What's this?
- Dead girl two.

92
00:22:26,058 --> 00:22:28,727
Sent over from the Valley
division this afternoon.

93
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:32,981
Are you sure there's
a point to all of this?

94
00:22:33,148 --> 00:22:35,150
Look at the name, Ed.

95
00:22:35,901 --> 00:22:39,488
Sarah Louise Connor. Is this right?

96
00:22:41,198 --> 00:22:42,366
You're kidding me.

97
00:22:42,533 --> 00:22:45,119
The press is gonna be short-stroking it.

98
00:22:45,285 --> 00:22:49,623
- A one-day pattern killer. Hm.
- I hate the weird ones.

99
00:22:54,253 --> 00:22:56,088
So...

100
00:22:57,548 --> 00:22:59,883
Better than mortal man deserves.

101
00:23:07,182 --> 00:23:11,520
- Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?
- Not lately. Did you check messages?

102
00:23:11,687 --> 00:23:13,063
I thought you did.

103
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,156
- Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...
- There you are, young man.

104
00:23:22,322 --> 00:23:24,491
You mind your mother.

105
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:32,249
Hi, Sarah. Stan Morsky.
Something's come up.

106
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:35,669
Looks like I won't be able to make
it tonight. Just can't get out of it.

107
00:23:35,836 --> 00:23:40,591
I'm really sorry. I'll make it up
to you. Call you in a day or so. Bye.

108
00:23:42,342 --> 00:23:45,762
That bum. So what if he has a Porsche?

109
00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:49,391
He can't treat you like this.
It's Friday night, for Christ's sake.

110
00:23:50,475 --> 00:23:52,477
I'll live.

111
00:23:52,644 --> 00:23:54,730
I'll break his kneecaps.

112
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:59,818
Well, Pugsley still loves me.
Don't you, baby?

113
00:24:00,736 --> 00:24:03,030
God. It's disgusting.

114
00:24:05,282 --> 00:24:07,826
I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.
Have a good time.

115
00:24:07,993 --> 00:24:10,913
- We will. You, too.
- OK.

116
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:17,085
Damn it, Matt.

117
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:16,603
- Oh, shit.
- Lieutenant!

118
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:20,274
These killings occurred in the order
of their listings in the phone book.

119
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,277
- What can I tell you? No comment.
- But, Lieutenant...

120
00:25:35,831 --> 00:25:39,001
- That coffee's two hours cold.
- Mm-hm.

121
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:41,086
I put a cigarette out in it.

122
00:25:42,254 --> 00:25:45,590
- Did you reach the next girl yet?
- No. I got her answering machine.

123
00:25:45,757 --> 00:25:48,051
- Send a unit.
- I sent a unit. There's no answer.

124
00:25:48,218 --> 00:25:50,387
- The apartment manager's not in.
- Call her.

125
00:25:50,554 --> 00:25:52,764
- I just called her.
- Call her again.

126
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,475
Give me a cigarette.

127
00:26:05,736 --> 00:26:07,612
Hi, there.

128
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:10,449
Fooled you.
You're talking to a machine.

129
00:26:10,615 --> 00:26:15,245
But don't be shy. It's OK.
Machines need love, too, so talk to it...

130
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:22,085
Same shit.

131
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:27,507
I can hear it now. He's gonna be
called the goddamn Phone Book Killer.

132
00:26:27,674 --> 00:26:32,929
I hate these press cases.
Especially the weird press cases.

133
00:26:34,431 --> 00:26:36,892
- Where are you going?
- To make a statement.

134
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:39,227
Maybe make these jackals
work for us for a change.

135
00:26:39,394 --> 00:26:43,940
If I can get on the tube by 11:00,
maybe she'll call us.

136
00:26:44,107 --> 00:26:46,693
Well, how do I look?

137
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:50,155
- Like shit, boss.
- Your mama.

138
00:26:51,281 --> 00:26:54,451
This just in. Police have
announced the name of the victim

139
00:26:54,618 --> 00:26:58,663
in the second of two execution style
murders which took place today.

140
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:02,626
Incredibly, the names of the two
victims are virtually identical.

141
00:27:02,793 --> 00:27:07,339
Two hours ago, 35-year-old
Sarah Ann Connor was pronounced dead...

142
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,300
- Can we change this?
- Sarah Louise Connor...

143
00:27:10,467 --> 00:27:12,052
Don't touch it!

144
00:27:14,137 --> 00:27:18,683
Police are refusing to speculate on
the similarity between the shooting deaths

145
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:22,938
and no other connection between
the two victims has been established yet.

146
00:27:23,105 --> 00:27:26,483
We'll have more on this
late-breaking story as it comes in.

147
00:28:57,657 --> 00:28:59,910
- Hey, you got a phone?
- It's in the back.

148
00:29:00,076 --> 00:29:02,370
Hey, $4.50.

149
00:29:41,785 --> 00:29:42,744
YOU HAVE REACHED

150
00:29:42,911 --> 00:29:44,829
the Los Angeles Police
Department emergency number.

151
00:29:44,996 --> 00:29:46,540
All lines are busy.

152
00:29:46,706 --> 00:29:49,793
If you need a police car sent out to you,
stay on the line.

153
00:30:54,065 --> 00:30:55,442
Pugsley! Shoo!

154
00:30:55,609 --> 00:30:58,236
Go on. I'm gonna make
a belt out of you.

155
00:31:09,706 --> 00:31:11,291
Whoa!

156
00:31:13,043 --> 00:31:14,878
Don't make me bust you up, man.

157
00:32:15,772 --> 00:32:19,234
Hi, there.
Fooled you. You're talking to a machine.

158
00:32:19,401 --> 00:32:22,278
But don't be shy. It's OK.
Machines need love, too.

159
00:32:22,445 --> 00:32:26,408
So talk to it and Ginger, that's me,
or Sarah will get back to you.

160
00:32:26,574 --> 00:32:29,369
Wait for the beep.

161
00:32:29,536 --> 00:32:31,538
Ginger, this is Sarah.
Pick up if you're there.

162
00:32:31,705 --> 00:32:37,544
I'm at this place on Pico Boulevard
called Tech Noir. I'm really scared.

163
00:32:37,711 --> 00:32:42,632
I think that there's somebody after me.
I hope that you play this back soon.

164
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,927
I need you and Matt to come
and pick me up as soon as possible.

165
00:32:46,678 --> 00:32:49,806
The police keep transferring me around.
I'm gonna give 'em another try.

166
00:32:49,973 --> 00:32:54,227
The number here is 555-9175.

167
00:32:54,394 --> 00:32:56,312
Call me, kiddo. I need your help.

168
00:33:13,455 --> 00:33:14,748
It's her.

169
00:33:16,082 --> 00:33:18,251
Sarah Connor? It's Lieutenant Traxler.

170
00:33:18,418 --> 00:33:21,671
Lieutenant, don't put me on hold and
don't transfer me to another department.

171
00:33:21,838 --> 00:33:24,340
Don't worry, I won't. Just relax.
Can you tell me where you are?

172
00:33:24,507 --> 00:33:28,344
- I'm in this bar called Tech Noir.
- Yeah, I know it. It's on Pico.

173
00:33:28,511 --> 00:33:31,055
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, but I don't wanna leave.

174
00:33:31,222 --> 00:33:35,101
- I think there's a guy following me.
- Now, listen carefully.

175
00:33:35,268 --> 00:33:37,645
You're in a public place,
so you'll be safe till we get there.

176
00:33:37,812 --> 00:33:40,106
But stay visible. Don't go outside
or even to the restroom.

177
00:33:40,273 --> 00:33:43,193
- I'll have a car there in a minute.
- OK.

178
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,260
Hey, that guy didn't pay.

179
00:36:49,212 --> 00:36:50,964
Come with me if you wanna live.

180
00:37:00,098 --> 00:37:01,099
Come on!

181
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,966
This is one-L-19.
I got a hit-and-run felony.

182
00:38:17,133 --> 00:38:21,471
Late model gray
Ford headed westbound on Seventh.

183
00:38:21,637 --> 00:38:23,973
He's really moving,
punching lights all the way.

184
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:27,935
I'm gonna need an ambulance
at Seventh and Broadway right now.

185
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:30,313
Hold it!

186
00:38:32,273 --> 00:38:33,566
Ah!

187
00:38:47,455 --> 00:38:48,372
Hold on.

188
00:39:00,343 --> 00:39:04,013
Are you injured? Are you shot?

189
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,939
Do exactly what I say. Exactly.

190
00:39:13,106 --> 00:39:16,651
Don't move unless I say.
Don't make a sound unless I say.

191
00:39:16,818 --> 00:39:18,236
Do you understand?

192
00:39:19,153 --> 00:39:22,865
- Do you understand?
- Yes! Please don't hurt me.

193
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:42,718
I'm here to help you.

194
00:39:42,885 --> 00:39:47,473
I'm Reese. Sergeant Tech-Com.
DN38416. Assigned to protect you.

195
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,350
You've been targeted for termination.

196
00:39:59,527 --> 00:40:01,237
This is one-L-19.

197
00:40:01,404 --> 00:40:03,906
Westbound on Olympic,
approaching Overland.

198
00:40:08,578 --> 00:40:12,039
This is a mistake.
I didn't do anything.

199
00:40:12,206 --> 00:40:15,918
No, but you will.
It's very important that you live.

200
00:40:16,085 --> 00:40:19,463
This isn't true. How could that
man just get up after you...

201
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:22,008
it's not a man. A machine.

202
00:40:22,175 --> 00:40:26,053
A Terminator.
Cyberdyne Systems model 101.

203
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:38,232
A machine? Like a robot?

204
00:40:38,399 --> 00:40:42,904
Not a robot. A cyborg.
Cybernetic organism.

205
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:45,865
- No. He was bleeding.
- Just a second.

206
00:40:49,368 --> 00:40:50,411
Get your head down!

207
00:41:35,373 --> 00:41:36,457
All right, listen.

208
00:41:36,624 --> 00:41:41,003
The Terminator's an infiltration unit.
Part man, part machine.

209
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:45,258
Underneath, it's a hyper-alloy
combat chassis. Microprocessor controlled.

210
00:41:45,424 --> 00:41:50,054
Fully armored, very tough.
But outside it's living human tissue.

211
00:41:50,221 --> 00:41:54,308
Flesh, skin, hair, blood...
grown for the cyborgs.

212
00:41:54,475 --> 00:41:57,019
- Look, Reese, I don't know...
- Pay attention.

213
00:41:57,186 --> 00:41:58,479
I gotta ditch this car.

214
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:08,281
The 600-Series had rubber skin.
We spotted them easy.

215
00:42:08,447 --> 00:42:10,908
But these are new. They look human.

216
00:42:11,075 --> 00:42:14,704
Sweat, bad breath, everything.
Very hard to spot.

217
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:18,582
I had to wait till he moved on
you before I could zero him.

218
00:42:18,749 --> 00:42:24,213
Look, I am not stupid.
They cannot make things like that yet.

219
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:28,426
Not yet. Not for about 40 years.

220
00:42:31,053 --> 00:42:32,972
Are you saying it's from the future?

221
00:42:33,139 --> 00:42:35,224
One possible future.

222
00:42:36,225 --> 00:42:39,520
From your point of view,
I don't know tech stuff.

223
00:42:40,688 --> 00:42:42,898
Then you're from the future, too.
Is that right?

224
00:42:43,065 --> 00:42:45,192
- Right.
- Right.

225
00:42:53,451 --> 00:42:58,748
Cyborgs don't feel pain.
I do. Don't do that again.

226
00:42:58,914 --> 00:43:02,752
- Just let me go.
- Listen and understand.

227
00:43:02,918 --> 00:43:06,672
That Terminator is out there.

228
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:10,509
It can't be bargained with,
it can't be reasoned with.

229
00:43:11,177 --> 00:43:15,389
It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear,

230
00:43:15,556 --> 00:43:21,437
and it absolutely will not stop...
ever... until you are dead.

231
00:43:31,614 --> 00:43:33,491
Can you stop it?

232
00:43:36,702 --> 00:43:39,080
I don't know.

233
00:43:40,956 --> 00:43:43,209
With these weapons, I don't know.

234
00:43:59,725 --> 00:44:01,394
All units.

235
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,021
Ford suspect vehicle has been
found in a parking structure...

236
00:44:47,648 --> 00:44:51,944
Reese, why me?

237
00:44:54,029 --> 00:44:55,573
Why does it want me?

238
00:45:02,246 --> 00:45:04,373
There was a nuclear war.

239
00:45:06,542 --> 00:45:09,170
A few years from now...

240
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,634
...all this, this whole place,
everything...

241
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:21,140
...it's gone. Just gone.

242
00:45:22,183 --> 00:45:23,893
There were survivors.

243
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:27,062
Here, there.

244
00:45:28,856 --> 00:45:31,317
Nobody even knew who started it.

245
00:45:33,986 --> 00:45:38,741
- It was the machines, Sarah.
- I don't understand.

246
00:45:38,908 --> 00:45:42,036
Defense network computers.

247
00:45:42,203 --> 00:45:45,372
New, powerful...

248
00:45:46,874 --> 00:45:50,794
...hooked into everything,
trusted to run it all.

249
00:45:51,587 --> 00:45:56,008
They say it got smart...
a new order of intelligence.

250
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,930
Then it saw all people as a threat.
Not just the ones on the other side.

251
00:46:02,932 --> 00:46:05,726
It decided our fate in a microsecond.

252
00:46:07,394 --> 00:46:09,146
Extermination.

253
00:46:23,536 --> 00:46:24,912
Did you see this war?

254
00:46:37,466 --> 00:46:42,263
No. I grew up after. In the ruins.

255
00:46:42,429 --> 00:46:45,474
Starving. Hiding from the H-Ks.

256
00:46:45,641 --> 00:46:48,644
- H-Ks?
- Hunter-killers.

257
00:46:48,811 --> 00:46:52,565
Patrol machines
built in automated factories.

258
00:46:52,731 --> 00:46:56,986
Most of us were rounded up,
put in camps for orderly disposal.

259
00:46:59,029 --> 00:47:01,323
This was burned in by laser scanner.

260
00:47:05,286 --> 00:47:09,832
Some of us were kept alive. To work.

261
00:47:10,791 --> 00:47:12,167
Loading bodies.

262
00:47:13,294 --> 00:47:16,005
The disposal units ran night and day.

263
00:47:16,171 --> 00:47:19,049
We were that close
to going out forever.

264
00:47:22,136 --> 00:47:26,015
But there was one man
who taught us to fight.

265
00:47:26,181 --> 00:47:28,100
To storm the wire of the camps.

266
00:47:28,267 --> 00:47:31,562
To smash those metal
motherfuckers into junk.

267
00:47:33,188 --> 00:47:35,941
He turned it around.
He brought us back from the brink.

268
00:47:36,108 --> 00:47:40,362
His name was Connor. John Connor.

269
00:47:40,529 --> 00:47:44,992
Your son, Sarah. Your unborn son.

270
00:49:34,768 --> 00:49:35,769
Drive!

271
00:49:43,068 --> 00:49:44,153
Reese!

272
00:49:44,987 --> 00:49:46,155
Reese!

273
00:50:04,173 --> 00:50:07,551
No, Reese. No, no, no. They'll kill you.

274
00:50:07,718 --> 00:50:10,554
You in the Cadillac,
let me see your hands now.

275
00:50:13,724 --> 00:50:14,725
Get out of the car.

276
00:50:18,479 --> 00:50:20,689
Drop to your knees.

277
00:50:20,856 --> 00:50:23,484
- Out of the car.
- Drop to the ground.

278
00:50:52,805 --> 00:50:56,725
Sarah. Sarah, try to drink some of this.

279
00:50:59,728 --> 00:51:01,897
Listen, are you sure it's them?

280
00:51:02,064 --> 00:51:04,858
I mean,
maybe I should look at the bodies.

281
00:51:05,025 --> 00:51:07,903
No. They've been identified
and there's no doubt.

282
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:13,617
Ginger.

283
00:51:15,202 --> 00:51:18,664
- Kiddo.
- Sarah...

284
00:51:18,831 --> 00:51:22,000
- Sarah, this is Dr. Silberman.
- Hi, Sarah.

285
00:51:22,167 --> 00:51:26,213
I want you to tell him everything
Reese told you. Do you feel up to that?

286
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:28,465
Yeah, I guess so.

287
00:51:30,259 --> 00:51:34,096
- You're a doctor?
- Criminal psychologist.

288
00:51:34,263 --> 00:51:38,475
- Is Reese crazy?
- That's what we're gonna find out.

289
00:53:03,685 --> 00:53:07,189
So you're a soldier.
Fighting for whom?

290
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:13,737
With the 132nd under Perry.
From '21 to '27.

291
00:53:14,529 --> 00:53:16,990
That's the year 2027?

292
00:53:17,157 --> 00:53:19,242
That's right.
Then I was assigned...

293
00:53:19,409 --> 00:53:23,038
- This is fucking great.
- ...under John Connor.

294
00:53:23,205 --> 00:53:26,291
- Who was the enemy?
- A computer defense system built...

295
00:53:26,458 --> 00:53:29,002
God damn. Sorry.

296
00:53:29,169 --> 00:53:32,506
...built for SAC-NORAD
by Cyberdyne Systems.

297
00:53:32,673 --> 00:53:34,633
I see.

298
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:40,681
And this computer thinks it can win
by killing the mother of its enemy.

299
00:53:40,847 --> 00:53:44,059
Killing him, in effect,
before he's even conceived.

300
00:53:44,226 --> 00:53:46,228
A sort of retroactive abortion?

301
00:53:48,105 --> 00:53:51,358
Silberman cracks me up.
Last week, a guy burned his Afghan.

302
00:53:51,525 --> 00:53:54,027
- He screwed it first...
- Ed, shut up.

303
00:53:54,194 --> 00:53:56,530
Why didn't the computer
just kill Connor then?

304
00:53:56,697 --> 00:53:59,241
Why this elaborate scheme
with the Terminator?

305
00:53:59,408 --> 00:54:03,495
It had no choice.
Their defense grid was smashed.

306
00:54:03,662 --> 00:54:08,083
We'd won. Taking out Connor
then would make no difference.

307
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:11,044
Skynet had to wipe out
his entire existence.

308
00:54:11,211 --> 00:54:14,423
Is that when you captured
the lab complex and found...

309
00:54:14,589 --> 00:54:16,258
What is it called?

310
00:54:16,425 --> 00:54:18,593
The time displacement equipment?

311
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:22,806
That's right. The Terminator
had already gone through.

312
00:54:22,973 --> 00:54:25,851
Connor sent me to intercept,
and they blew the whole place.

313
00:54:26,018 --> 00:54:27,853
Well, how are you supposed to get back?

314
00:54:28,729 --> 00:54:30,439
I can't.

315
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:37,529
Nobody goes home.
Nobody else comes through.

316
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,366
It's just him and me.

317
00:56:25,804 --> 00:56:28,640
It's just him and me.

318
00:56:31,726 --> 00:56:34,271
Why didn't you
bring any weapons?

319
00:56:34,437 --> 00:56:36,690
Something more advanced.

320
00:56:36,857 --> 00:56:39,818
Don't you have ray guns?

321
00:56:39,985 --> 00:56:43,655
- Ray guns.
- Show me a piece of future technology.

322
00:56:43,822 --> 00:56:45,699
You go naked.

323
00:56:45,866 --> 00:56:48,201
Something about the field
generated by a living organism.

324
00:56:48,368 --> 00:56:50,412
- Nothing dead will go.
- Why?

325
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:52,247
I didn't build the fucking thing.

326
00:56:52,414 --> 00:56:57,169
OK, OK. But this cyborg,
if it's metal...?

327
00:56:57,335 --> 00:56:59,754
- Surrounded by living tissue.
- Oh, right.

328
00:57:00,547 --> 00:57:03,300
This is great stuff.
I could make a career out of this guy.

329
00:57:03,466 --> 00:57:06,261
See how clever it is?
It doesn't require a shred of proof.

330
00:57:06,428 --> 00:57:09,890
Most paranoid delusions are intricate,
but this is brilliant.

331
00:57:12,225 --> 00:57:14,394
Why were the
other two women killed?

332
00:57:14,561 --> 00:57:16,188
Most records
were lost in the war.

333
00:57:16,354 --> 00:57:18,940
Skynet knew almost nothing
about Connor's mother.

334
00:57:19,107 --> 00:57:22,527
Her full name, where she lived.
They just knew the city.

335
00:57:22,694 --> 00:57:25,780
The Terminator was
just being systematic.

336
00:57:25,947 --> 00:57:28,783
- Let's go back...
- Look, you have heard enough.

337
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:31,912
I have answered your questions.
Now I have to see Sarah Connor.

338
00:57:32,078 --> 00:57:36,041
- I'm afraid that's not up to me.
- Then why am I talking to you?

339
00:57:36,208 --> 00:57:38,043
- Who is in authority here?
- Please...

340
00:57:38,210 --> 00:57:39,753
Shut up!

341
00:57:40,503 --> 00:57:43,131
You still don't get it, do you?

342
00:57:43,298 --> 00:57:48,386
He'll find her. That's what he does.
That's all he does.

343
00:57:48,553 --> 00:57:50,305
You can't stop him.

344
00:57:50,472 --> 00:57:54,100
He'll reach down her throat
and pull her fucking heart out!

345
00:57:54,267 --> 00:57:56,770
- Doc.
- Let go of me!

346
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:01,691
Sorry.

347
00:58:06,112 --> 00:58:08,490
So Reese is crazy?

348
00:58:08,657 --> 00:58:12,160
In technical terminology, he's a loon.

349
00:58:12,994 --> 00:58:18,458
Sarah, this is what they call
body armor. Our TAC guys wear these.

350
00:58:18,625 --> 00:58:20,752
It'll stop a 12-gauge round.

351
00:58:20,919 --> 00:58:23,129
This other individual must've
been wearing one under his coat.

352
00:58:23,296 --> 00:58:24,965
Feel that. Go ahead.

353
00:58:27,259 --> 00:58:30,845
- He punched through the windshield.
- He was probably on PCP.

354
00:58:31,012 --> 00:58:33,682
Broke every bone in his hand.
He wouldn't feel it for hours.

355
00:58:33,848 --> 00:58:35,433
There was this guy once...
You see this scar?

356
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,018
- Here.
- Thank you.

357
00:58:38,436 --> 00:58:42,190
There's a couch in this other room.
Stretch out and get some sleep.

358
00:58:42,357 --> 00:58:44,693
Be at least an hour before your
mother gets here from Big Bear.

359
00:58:44,859 --> 00:58:47,946
- I can't sleep.
- Try.

360
00:58:48,113 --> 00:58:52,367
It may not look it,
but that couch is very comfortable.

361
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:58,164
You'll be perfectly safe.
We got 30 cops in this building.

362
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,292
Thank you.

363
00:59:06,756 --> 00:59:08,258
- Good night.
- Good night.

364
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:27,068
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
I was told she's here. Could I see her?

365
00:59:27,235 --> 00:59:29,404
No. Can't see her.
She's making a statement.

366
00:59:29,571 --> 00:59:30,697
Where is she?

367
00:59:31,656 --> 00:59:34,451
It may take a while. If you wanna wait,
there's a bench over there.

368
00:59:46,004 --> 00:59:47,505
I'll be back.

369
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:27,545
Ah!

370
01:00:37,097 --> 01:00:38,431
Let's go, let's go!

371
01:00:43,186 --> 01:00:44,312
Stay here.

372
01:00:58,785 --> 01:01:00,662
Let's get outta here!

373
01:01:24,769 --> 01:01:25,895
Watch him.

374
01:02:33,755 --> 01:02:35,089
Ed...

375
01:02:35,965 --> 01:02:37,300
Hey!

376
01:03:03,952 --> 01:03:04,786
Sarah!

377
01:03:06,788 --> 01:03:08,122
Reese.

378
01:03:12,043 --> 01:03:13,211
This way.

379
01:03:54,002 --> 01:03:56,588
KFLB news time 4:36.

380
01:03:56,754 --> 01:04:00,550
The largest
single law enforcement mobilization

381
01:04:00,717 --> 01:04:03,303
in California history
is currently underway.

382
01:04:03,469 --> 01:04:07,056
Police in five counties are engaged
in a massive manhunt for...

383
01:04:10,643 --> 01:04:12,020
Take this.

384
01:04:15,106 --> 01:04:16,816
All right,
let's get this off the road.

385
01:04:48,806 --> 01:04:51,684
- You cold?
- Freezing.

386
01:05:05,657 --> 01:05:06,824
Reese?

387
01:05:08,743 --> 01:05:12,455
- You got a first name?
- Kyle.

388
01:05:12,622 --> 01:05:16,918
Kyle, what's it like
when you go through time?

389
01:05:19,754 --> 01:05:21,589
White light.

390
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:25,385
Pain.

391
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:32,934
- It's like being born maybe.
- Oh, my God.

392
01:05:33,851 --> 01:05:35,770
I caught one back there.

393
01:05:37,355 --> 01:05:40,108
- You mean you got shot?
- It's not bad.

394
01:05:40,983 --> 01:05:44,445
- We gotta get you to a doctor.
- It's OK. Forget it.

395
01:05:44,612 --> 01:05:49,283
What do you mean, forget it?
Are you crazy? Take this off.

396
01:06:01,546 --> 01:06:03,548
Jesus.

397
01:06:03,715 --> 01:06:06,592
See? It passed right through the meat.

398
01:06:06,759 --> 01:06:08,386
This is gonna make me puke.

399
01:06:09,137 --> 01:06:11,931
- Would you just talk about something?
- What?

400
01:06:12,098 --> 01:06:15,560
I don't know. Anything.
Just talk. Tell me about my son.

401
01:06:17,395 --> 01:06:18,980
He's about my height.

402
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:24,652
He has your eyes.

403
01:06:27,989 --> 01:06:29,574
What's he like?

404
01:06:30,366 --> 01:06:34,036
You trust him.
He's got a strength.

405
01:06:35,747 --> 01:06:37,623
I'd die for John Connor.

406
01:06:40,543 --> 01:06:44,172
Well, at least now I know
what to name him.

407
01:06:45,339 --> 01:06:50,094
Don't suppose you know who the father
is so I won't tell him to get lost?

408
01:06:50,261 --> 01:06:53,014
John never said much about him.

409
01:06:53,181 --> 01:06:55,683
- I know he dies before the war...
- Wait.

410
01:06:57,602 --> 01:06:59,395
I don't wanna know.

411
01:07:00,688 --> 01:07:03,399
So was it John that sent you here?

412
01:07:04,108 --> 01:07:05,651
I volunteered.

413
01:07:06,903 --> 01:07:10,698
- Why?
- It was a chance to meet the legend.

414
01:07:11,783 --> 01:07:18,623
Sarah Connor,
who taught her son to fight, organize,

415
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:20,875
prepare from when he was a kid.

416
01:07:21,042 --> 01:07:23,085
When you were in hiding before the war.

417
01:07:26,214 --> 01:07:30,635
You're talking about things
I haven't done yet in the past tense.

418
01:07:30,802 --> 01:07:32,678
It's driving me crazy.

419
01:07:36,557 --> 01:07:39,310
Are you sure you
have the right person?

420
01:07:39,477 --> 01:07:41,521
I'm sure.

421
01:07:41,687 --> 01:07:45,399
Come on. Do I look like
the mother of the future?

422
01:07:47,235 --> 01:07:52,073
I mean, am I tough? Organized?
I can't even balance my checkbook.

423
01:07:54,867 --> 01:07:58,996
Look, Reese, I didn't ask
for this honor and I don't want it.

424
01:07:59,163 --> 01:08:00,623
Any of it.

425
01:08:03,918 --> 01:08:08,130
Your son gave me a message
to give to you. Made me memorize it.

426
01:08:09,465 --> 01:08:12,176
"'Thank you, Sarah,
for your courage through the dark years.

427
01:08:12,343 --> 01:08:14,470
I can't help you
with what you must soon face,

428
01:08:14,637 --> 01:08:16,931
except to say the future is not set.

429
01:08:17,098 --> 01:08:19,600
You must be stronger
than you imagine you can be.

430
01:08:19,767 --> 01:08:22,270
You must survive or I will never exist."'

431
01:08:23,604 --> 01:08:25,064
That's all.

432
01:08:28,025 --> 01:08:29,569
It's a good field dressing.

433
01:08:31,112 --> 01:08:32,613
You like it?

434
01:08:33,364 --> 01:08:34,782
It's my first.

435
01:08:39,078 --> 01:08:41,455
Get some sleep.
It'll be light soon.

436
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:46,961
OK.

437
01:08:57,638 --> 01:08:59,557
Talk to me some more.

438
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:04,353
About what?

439
01:09:05,563 --> 01:09:07,690
Tell me about where you're from.

440
01:09:10,151 --> 01:09:11,652
All right.

441
01:09:13,571 --> 01:09:18,075
You stay down by day,
but at night you can move around.

442
01:09:18,242 --> 01:09:22,163
You still have to be careful
because the H-Ks use infrared.

443
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:29,337
But they're not too bright.
John taught us ways to dust them.

444
01:09:30,796 --> 01:09:33,049
That's when the infiltrators
started to appear.

445
01:09:33,215 --> 01:09:35,551
The Terminators were the newest.

446
01:09:35,885 --> 01:09:36,802
The worst.

447
01:09:46,854 --> 01:09:48,689
Traversing
your sector in search mode.

448
01:09:48,856 --> 01:09:51,442
750 meters north of your position.

449
01:09:56,405 --> 01:09:57,531
Let's go.

450
01:10:42,994 --> 01:10:46,956
- Reese. DN384...
- Right. Let him in.

451
01:12:18,464 --> 01:12:20,341
Terminator!

452
01:12:39,235 --> 01:12:40,069
Ah!

453
01:13:37,585 --> 01:13:39,920
I was dreaming about dogs.

454
01:13:41,172 --> 01:13:43,549
We use 'em to spot Terminators.

455
01:13:44,633 --> 01:13:47,178
Your world is pretty terrifying.

456
01:14:25,966 --> 01:14:29,803
Hey, buddy,
you got a dead cat in there or what?

457
01:14:37,228 --> 01:14:39,396
Fuck you, asshole.

458
01:14:58,249 --> 01:15:00,084
God damn.

459
01:15:01,168 --> 01:15:02,586
Thank you.

460
01:15:08,008 --> 01:15:09,510
Is this enough?

461
01:15:10,177 --> 01:15:13,347
Yeah, it's enough.
I don't wanna ask where you got it.

462
01:15:19,687 --> 01:15:21,188
- I'm coming.
- We need a room.

463
01:15:21,355 --> 01:15:23,357
- All right.
- With a kitchen.

464
01:15:23,524 --> 01:15:24,984
Do you have one with a kitchen?

465
01:15:41,041 --> 01:15:43,877
I am dying for a shower.

466
01:15:45,504 --> 01:15:47,673
We should check your bandage, too.

467
01:15:48,257 --> 01:15:50,926
Later. I'm going out for supplies.

468
01:15:55,639 --> 01:15:56,807
Keep this.

469
01:16:22,875 --> 01:16:26,253
No, I can't tell you where I am, Mom.
I was told not to say.

470
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:28,589
But I need to
know where to reach you.

471
01:16:28,756 --> 01:16:33,886
You tell me to hide out at the cabin
and you won't tell me what's going on?

472
01:16:34,053 --> 01:16:36,805
I am worried sick here.

473
01:16:36,972 --> 01:16:40,726
OK. OK, here's the number.

474
01:16:40,893 --> 01:16:43,103
- You ready?
- Yes. Go ahead.

475
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:49,943
It's 408-555-1439. Room nine.

476
01:16:50,110 --> 01:16:51,862
- Got it?
- I've got it.

477
01:16:52,029 --> 01:16:56,200
I gotta go. I'm sorry
I can't tell you more right now.

478
01:16:56,367 --> 01:16:58,118
I love you, Mom.

479
01:17:01,622 --> 01:17:03,499
I love you, too, sweetheart.

480
01:17:16,387 --> 01:17:17,346
Tiki Motel.

481
01:17:17,513 --> 01:17:18,806
Give me your address there.

482
01:17:22,476 --> 01:17:24,144
What have we got?

483
01:17:27,272 --> 01:17:33,404
Mothballs... corn syrup... ammonia.

484
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:35,197
What's for dinner?

485
01:17:35,906 --> 01:17:38,992
- Plastique.
- Mm. That sounds good.

486
01:17:39,159 --> 01:17:40,536
What is it?

487
01:17:41,453 --> 01:17:44,998
It's a nitroglycerin base.
It's a bit more stable.

488
01:17:45,165 --> 01:17:47,042
I learned to make it when I was a kid.

489
01:17:58,929 --> 01:18:01,056
Make sure there's none on the threads.

490
01:18:03,267 --> 01:18:04,685
Like this.

491
01:18:06,645 --> 01:18:08,439
Screw the end cap on.

492
01:18:10,357 --> 01:18:11,900
Very gently.

493
01:18:14,653 --> 01:18:16,947
You must've had a fun childhood.

494
01:18:20,659 --> 01:18:22,035
That's good.

495
01:18:22,995 --> 01:18:26,039
All right. Six more like that
and I'll get started on the fuses.

496
01:18:37,509 --> 01:18:39,470
He'll find us, won't he?

497
01:18:42,473 --> 01:18:43,974
Probably.

498
01:19:02,075 --> 01:19:04,203
It'll never be over, will it?

499
01:19:12,628 --> 01:19:14,630
Look at me. I'm shaking.

500
01:19:15,839 --> 01:19:20,928
Some legend.
You must be pretty disappointed.

501
01:19:22,012 --> 01:19:25,933
No, I'm not.

502
01:19:34,650 --> 01:19:39,947
Kyle, the women in your time,

503
01:19:40,113 --> 01:19:42,199
what are they like?

504
01:19:44,284 --> 01:19:46,370
Good fighters.

505
01:19:46,537 --> 01:19:48,580
That's not what I meant.

506
01:19:50,749 --> 01:19:52,584
Was there someone special?

507
01:19:54,628 --> 01:19:56,171
Someone?

508
01:19:56,797 --> 01:19:58,966
A girl, you know.

509
01:20:00,467 --> 01:20:01,843
No.

510
01:20:04,638 --> 01:20:06,265
Never.

511
01:20:07,849 --> 01:20:09,476
Never?

512
01:20:14,439 --> 01:20:17,818
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

513
01:20:20,696 --> 01:20:22,781
So much pain.

514
01:20:24,157 --> 01:20:28,495
Pain can be controlled.
You just disconnect it.

515
01:20:28,662 --> 01:20:30,914
So you feel nothing?

516
01:20:36,086 --> 01:20:39,006
John Connor gave me
a picture of you once.

517
01:20:40,924 --> 01:20:42,718
I didn't know why at the time.

518
01:20:44,177 --> 01:20:50,017
It was very old... torn, faded.

519
01:20:53,854 --> 01:20:59,860
You were young like you are now.
You seemed just a little sad.

520
01:21:01,403 --> 01:21:04,156
I used to always wonder
what you were thinking at that moment.

521
01:21:05,616 --> 01:21:07,826
I memorized every line...

522
01:21:09,328 --> 01:21:11,204
...every curve.

523
01:21:14,875 --> 01:21:16,793
I came across time for you, Sarah.

524
01:21:18,712 --> 01:21:23,008
I love you. I always have.

525
01:21:41,068 --> 01:21:42,736
I shouldn't have said that.

526
01:23:13,618 --> 01:23:14,661
Think fast.

527
01:24:44,876 --> 01:24:46,211
Trade places.

528
01:24:57,222 --> 01:25:00,559
Faster! Drive faster!

529
01:25:50,483 --> 01:25:53,653
Kyle! Oh, my God.

530
01:26:27,896 --> 01:26:29,230
Kyle.

531
01:26:43,954 --> 01:26:45,372
- Whoa!
- Son-of-a-bitch!

532
01:27:01,554 --> 01:27:02,555
You stay here.

533
01:27:26,538 --> 01:27:27,706
Let's get outta here.

534
01:27:31,376 --> 01:27:32,627
Get out.

535
01:27:49,769 --> 01:27:52,731
Kyle. Come on. Get up.

536
01:28:01,281 --> 01:28:03,825
Kyle, come on.

537
01:28:04,951 --> 01:28:07,829
Help me! Get out. Get out.

538
01:28:32,312 --> 01:28:34,272
Don't stop. Run!

539
01:30:46,446 --> 01:30:47,989
Sarah!

540
01:30:49,032 --> 01:30:49,908
Kyle.

541
01:30:55,955 --> 01:30:58,499
Kyle. Kyle...

542
01:31:00,585 --> 01:31:03,338
We did it, Kyle. We got him.

543
01:31:23,066 --> 01:31:24,150
No!

544
01:31:24,651 --> 01:31:25,985
No!

545
01:32:21,874 --> 01:32:23,167
Wait.

546
01:32:28,006 --> 01:32:29,632
What are you doing?

547
01:32:30,508 --> 01:32:33,678
Cover, so he can't track us.

548
01:32:43,396 --> 01:32:46,566
Come on! Come on.

549
01:32:46,733 --> 01:32:50,403
No, Kyle! Come on!

550
01:32:51,154 --> 01:32:52,905
- Come on!
- Leave me here.

551
01:33:04,042 --> 01:33:08,421
Move it, Reese! On your feet, soldier!

552
01:33:08,755 --> 01:33:10,923
On your feet!

553
01:33:11,466 --> 01:33:12,300
Move it!

554
01:34:24,414 --> 01:34:26,082
Get back. Go back.

555
01:35:00,616 --> 01:35:02,410
- Run, Sarah.
- No.

556
01:35:02,577 --> 01:35:03,870
Run!

557
01:35:07,707 --> 01:35:08,666
Run!

558
01:35:09,876 --> 01:35:11,419
Come on, motherfucker.

559
01:37:04,407 --> 01:37:06,576
No.

560
01:39:05,069 --> 01:39:06,737
You're terminated, fucker.

561
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:06,172
Kyle.

562
01:40:27,193 --> 01:40:31,197
Tape seven.
November 10. Where was I?

563
01:40:32,156 --> 01:40:35,993
What's most difficult is trying to decide
what to tell you and what not to.

564
01:40:36,702 --> 01:40:40,706
But I guess I have a while before you're
old enough to understand these tapes.

565
01:40:40,873 --> 01:40:44,627
They're more for me at this point
just so that I can get it straight.

566
01:41:21,747 --> 01:41:23,082
Fill her up.

567
01:41:26,752 --> 01:41:29,880
Should I tell you
about your father?

568
01:41:30,047 --> 01:41:32,299
Boy, that's a tough one.

569
01:41:33,843 --> 01:41:38,347
Will it affect your decision to send him
here, knowing that he is your father?

570
01:41:40,599 --> 01:41:43,352
If you don't send Kyle,
you can never be.

571
01:41:43,519 --> 01:41:46,605
God, a person could go crazy
thinking about this.

572
01:41:50,276 --> 01:41:52,152
I suppose I will tell you.

573
01:41:53,988 --> 01:41:55,781
I owe him that.

574
01:41:58,200 --> 01:42:00,536
Maybe it'll help if...

575
01:42:00,703 --> 01:42:06,125
...you know that in the few hours
that we had together...

576
01:42:07,793 --> 01:42:10,212
...we loved a lifetime's worth.

577
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:26,937
- What did he just say?
- He says you're very beautiful.

578
01:42:27,104 --> 01:42:29,982
He is ashamed to ask you for
five American dollars for this picture.

579
01:42:30,149 --> 01:42:33,569
But if he doesn't,
his father will beat him.

580
01:42:33,736 --> 01:42:36,488
Pretty good hustle, kid.

581
01:42:52,796 --> 01:42:54,381
What did he just say?

582
01:42:55,132 --> 01:42:57,217
He said there's a storm coming in.

583
01:43:01,639 --> 01:43:03,515
I know.
