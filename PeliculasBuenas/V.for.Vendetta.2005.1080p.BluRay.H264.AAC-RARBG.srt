1
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:44,919
" Remember, remember the 5th of November "

2
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:47,755
" The gunpowder treason and plot "

3
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:50,216
" I know of no reason
Why the gunpowder treason "

4
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:52,301
" Should ever be forgot "

5
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,306
" But what of the man? "

6
00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:00,977
" I know his name was Guy Fawkes... "

7
00:01:01,145 --> 00:01:05,898
" and I know in 1605, he attempted
to blow up the Houses of Parliament. "

8
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,276
" But who was he really? "

9
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:09,902
" What was he like? "

10
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:20,204
" We are told to remember
the idea and not the man. "

11
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:21,956
" Because a man can fail. "

12
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:27,128
" He can be caught,
he can be killed and forgotten. "

13
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:29,338
" But 400 years later... "

14
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:32,258
" an idea can still change the world. "

15
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:37,263
" I have witnessed firsthand
the power of ideas. "

16
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,849
" I've seen people kill
in the name of them... "

17
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,394
" and die defending them. "

18
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,648
" But you cannot kiss an idea... "

19
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:51,027
" cannot touch it or hold it. "

20
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,865
" Ideas do not bleed.
They do not feel pain. "

21
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:58,075
" They do not love. "

22
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:03,456
" And it is not an idea that I miss. "

23
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,583
" It is a man. "

24
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:09,295
" A man that made me remember
the 5th of November. "

25
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,547
" A man that I will never forget. "

26
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:21,600
FarangSiam thanks you.
Have Fun!

27
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:29,982
" So I read that the former United States
is so desperate for medical supplies... "

28
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,534
" that they have allegedly
sent several "

29
00:02:32,568 --> 00:02:35,229
" containers filled with
wheat and tobacco. "

30
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,783
" A gesture, they said, of goodwill. "

31
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,827
" You wanna know what I think? "

32
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:44,622
" Well, you're listening to my show,
so I will assume you do. "

33
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,167
" It's high time we let the colonies know
what we really think of them. "

34
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,439
" I think it's payback time
for a tea party "

35
00:02:50,473 --> 00:02:52,621
" they threw us a few
hundred years ago. "

36
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,967
" I say we go down to those docks tonight
and dump that crap... "

37
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,428
" where everything from the
Ulcered Sphincter of Ass-Erica belongs! "

38
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,014
" Who's with me?
Who's bloody with me?! "

39
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,767
" Did you like that? "

40
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:09,105
" U.S.A., Ulcered Sphincter of Ass-Erica.
I mean, what else can you say? "

41
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:12,859
" Here was a country that had everything,
absolutely everything... "

42
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,361
" and now, 20 years later, is what? "

43
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:19,198
" The world's biggest leper colony. Why? "

44
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,450
" Godlessness. "

45
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,244
" Let me say that again. "

46
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,704
" Godlessness. "

47
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:28,457
" It wasn't the war they started.
It wasn't the plague they created. "

48
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,835
" It was Judgment. "

49
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:35,131
" No one escapes their past.
No one escapes Judgment. "

50
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,551
" You think he's not up there? "

51
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,220
" You think he's not watching over
this country? "

52
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:45,600
" How else can you explain it?
He tested us, but we came through. "

53
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,184
" We did what we had to do. "

54
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,439
" Islington. Enfield.
I was there. I saw it all. "

55
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:53,983
" Immigrants, Muslims... "

56
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:56,903
" homosexuals, terrorists. "

57
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,990
" Disease-ridden degenerates.
They had to go. "

58
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:04,327
" Strength through unity.
Unity through faith. "

59
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:08,456
" I am a God-fearing Englishman,
and I'm goddamn proud of it! "

60
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:11,000
That's quite enough of that,
thank you very much.

61
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,420
Oh, shit.

62
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:20,301
" A yellow-coded curfew
is now in effect. "

63
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,804
" Any unauthorized personnel
will be subject to arrest. "

64
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,474
" This is for your protection. "

65
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:29,936
" A yellow-coded curfew
is now in effect. "

66
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,564
" Any unauthorized personnel
will be subject to arrest. "

67
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,149
" This is for your protection. "

68
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,278
- Whoa! Excuse me.
- Sorry, I didn't see you...

69
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,113
- In a hurry, are we?
- I was just...

70
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,991
- It's past curfew, you know.
- My uncle, he's very sick.

71
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,745
- Sick uncle? What you think, Willy?
- It's a load of bollocks.

72
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,831
I made a mistake. I shouldn't be out
after curfew. I know that.

73
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:54,335
Maybe you could look after us
before getting back to your uncle.

74
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,671
See, my friend, he's kind of sick.
Ain't you?

75
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,674
Real sick. Bad case of the blues.
You can feel them.

76
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:03,511
- Don't touch me!
- Look, Willy, kitty's got claws.

77
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:06,472
- She just threatened us.
- That she did, that she did.

78
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,224
You know what that means, don't you?

79
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:11,143
It means that we exercise
our own judicial discretion.

80
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,187
And you get to swallow it.

81
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,481
- You're Fingermen.
- She's getting the picture.

82
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,358
No, please, I didn't know. I'm sorry.

83
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,527
Not yet you're not. But you will be.

84
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:23,239
By sunup, if you're not the sorriest
piece of ass in all of London...

85
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,825
then you’ll certainly be the sorest.

86
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,539
Oh, God, no. Please don't do this.

87
00:05:31,707 --> 00:05:34,208
I'll go home. I won't do it again,
I swear! Please!

88
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:37,628
- What do you think, lads?
- Spare the rod, spoil the child.

89
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:39,380
Help me! Someone help!

90
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,883
" The multiplying villainies of nature
do swarm upon him. "

91
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,095
- What the hell?
- Bugger off!

92
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,347
" Disdaining fortune,
with his brandished steel... "

93
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,391
" which smoked with bloody execution. "

94
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,101
We're Fingermen, pal.

95
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,290
Aha!

96
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,929
Jesus Christ! Mercy!

97
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,265
" We are oft to blame in this...
It's too much proved. "

98
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,517
" That with devotion's visage
and pious action... "

99
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:35,311
" we do sugar o'er the devil himself. "

100
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:38,147
- What's that mean?
- Spare the rod.

101
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,780
I can assure you, I mean you no harm.

102
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,615
- Who are you?
- Who?

103
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:50,242
Who is but the form
following the function of what...

104
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,244
and what I am is a man in a mask.

105
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,455
- Oh, I can see that.
- Of course you can.

106
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,791
I'm not questioning your powers
of observation.

107
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:01,045
I'm merely remarking upon the paradox
of asking a masked man who he is.

108
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:05,841
- Oh. Right.
- But on this most auspicious of nights...

109
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:09,303
permit me then, in lieu of
the more commonplace sobriquet...

110
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,681
to suggest the character
of this "dramatis persona".

111
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,392
Voilà!

112
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,561
In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran...

113
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:21,899
cast vicariously as both victim
and villain by the vicissitudes of fate.

114
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,777
This visage, no mere veneer of vanity...

115
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:28,447
is a vestige of the vox populi,
now vacant, vanished.

116
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:32,993
However, this valorous visitation
of a bygone vexation stands vivified...

117
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:36,872
and has vowed to vanquish these venal
and virulent vermin vanguarding vice...

118
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,835
and vouchsafing the violently vicious
and voracious violation of volition.

119
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:50,136
The only verdict is vengeance,
a vendetta...

120
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:54,014
held as a votive not in vain,
for the value and veracity of such...

121
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,476
shall one day vindicate the vigilant
and the virtuous.

122
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,983
Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage
veers most verbose.

123
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:07,069
So let me simply add that it's
my very good honor to meet you...

124
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,946
and you may call me V.

125
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,200
Are you, like, a crazy person?

126
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:15,411
I am quite sure they will say so.

127
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,538
But to whom, might I ask, am I speaking?

128
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,584
- I'm Evey.
- Evey?

129
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,128
E-vey. Of course you are.

130
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:27,006
- What does that mean?
- It means that I, like God...

131
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:30,384
do not play with dice
and do not believe in coincidence.

132
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,386
Are you hurt?

133
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,263
No, I'm fine.

134
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,100
- Thanks to you.
- Oh, I merely played my part.

135
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,979
- But tell me, do you enjoy music, Evey?
- I suppose.

136
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,190
You see, I'm a musician of sorts...

137
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,734
and on my way to give
a very special performance.

138
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:48,485
What kind of musician?

139
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,529
Percussion instruments are my speciality.

140
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:54,033
But tonight I intend to call upon
the entire orchestra for this event...

141
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,243
and would be honored
if you could join me.

142
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,537
I don't think so.
I should be getting home.

143
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,248
I promise you, it'll be like
nothing you've ever seen.

144
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:04,210
And afterwards,
you'll return home safely.

145
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:07,630
All right.

146
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,050
It's beautiful up here.

147
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,596
A more perfect stage
could not be asked for.

148
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,264
I don't see any instruments.

149
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,351
Your powers of observation
continue to serve you well.

150
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:25,773
But wait. It is to Madame Justice
that I dedicate this concerto...

151
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:29,235
in honor of the holiday she seems
to have taken from these parts...

152
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:33,447
and in recognition of the imposter
that stands in her stead.

153
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,825
Tell me, do you know what day it is, Evey?

154
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:41,372
- November the 4th?
- Not anymore.

155
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,798
" Remember, remember the 5th of November "

156
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:54,051
" The gunpowder treason and plot "

157
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,179
" I know of no reason
Why the gunpowder treason "

158
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,890
" Should ever be forgot. "

159
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,605
First, the overture.

160
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,650
Yes.

161
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,111
Yes, the strings.

162
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,739
Listen carefully, can you hear it?

163
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,993
Now the brass.

164
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,911
I can hear it!

165
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,004
Look outside, Mommy!
They're playing music!

166
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,844
- How do you do that?
- Wait.

167
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:38,929
Here comes the crescendo!

168
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:49,023
How beautiful, is it not?

169
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:04,913
" Gentlemen, you have had four hours.
You had better have results. Mr. Creedy. "

170
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,958
The Bailey area is quarantined.

171
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:10,377
All significant witnesses
have been detained.

172
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:11,754
" Good. Mr. Etheridge? "

173
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,966
A recording device was found wired into
the central emergency-broadcast system.

174
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:18,886
The DCD was Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture.

175
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,513
" Add it to the blacklist.
I never want to hear that again. "

176
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,890
Yes, sir.

177
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:26,810
We also doubled our random sweeps
and are monitoring phone surveillance...

178
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:30,564
indicating a high percentage
of conversation about the explosion.

179
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,691
" Mr. Dascomb,
what are we doing about that? "

180
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,235
We're calling it
an emergency demolition.

181
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:38,447
We have spin coverage on the network
and throughout the InterLink.

182
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:42,826
Experts have been lined up to testify
against the Bailey's structural integrity.

183
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,954
" I want Prothero to speak on
the dangers of these old buildings... "

184
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:49,583
" ...and how we must avoid clinging
to the edifice of a decadent past. "

185
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:53,420
" He should conclude that the New Bailey
will become the symbol of our time... "

186
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:56,757
" and the future
that our conviction has rewarded us. "

187
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,133
" Mr. Heyer. "

188
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:01,512
Our surveillance cameras captured
several images of the terrorist...

189
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:05,057
though the mask obviously makes
retinal identification impossible.

190
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:10,396
We also managed to get a picture of
the girl that Creedy's men were detaining.

191
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,856
" - Who is she, Mr. Finch? "
- Not sure yet, sir.

192
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,567
- But we're working on several leads.
" - Anything else? "

193
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,528
We located the fireworks launch...

194
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,572
and found traces
of the explosives used at both sites.

195
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:25,994
Unfortunately it appears that despite
the heavy level of sophistication...

196
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:29,873
these devices were homemade
with over-the-counter chemicals...

197
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,543
...making them very difficult to trace.

198
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:36,547
Whoever he is, chancellor, he's very good.

199
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:40,092
" Spare us your professional annotations,
Mr. Finch. They are irrelevant. "

200
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,969
Apologies, chancellor.

201
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,804
" Gentlemen, this is a test. "

202
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,598
" Moments such as these
are matters of faith. "

203
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,977
" To fail is to invite doubt
into everything we believe... "

204
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,812
" everything we have fought for. "

205
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,130
" Doubt will plunge this country back "

206
00:12:54,164 --> 00:12:56,975
" into chaos, and I will not let
that happen. "

207
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,653
" Gentlemen,
I want this terrorist found... "

208
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:04,158
" and I want him to understand
what terror really means. "

209
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,784
" England prevails. "

210
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,537
" England prevails. "

211
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:18,005
- You think people will buy this?
- Why not?

212
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:20,090
This is the BTN.

213
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:23,051
Our job is to report the news,
not fabricate it.

214
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,679
That's the government's job.

215
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:28,932
" On the lighter side of things... "

216
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,603
" seems that the crew responsible for
the demolition of the Old Bailey... "

217
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,856
" wanted to give the old girl a grand,
albeit improvised, sendoff. "

218
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,902
" Although the demolition had been
planned for some time... "

219
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:43,155
" the music and the fireworks were,
according to the crew chief... "

220
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:46,200
" - "definitely not on the schedule."
- We'll be right back. "

221
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,204
Do you believe that load of bollocks?
I mean, there was no bloody demolition.

222
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,830
I saw it, the whole thing.

223
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,708
- Did you see it?
- No. Last night I was...

224
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:58,170
Yeah, that's right. You went
to see Daddy Deitrich, didn't you?

225
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:00,839
Evey, there you are.

226
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,175
- You are still working for me.
- Sorry, Patricia.

227
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,719
I need two espressos and three coffees.

228
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,888
And Deitrich is ready for his tea.

229
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,350
I don't get it.

230
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:15,562
Why does he wear a Guy Fawkes mask?
Didn't Fawkes try to blow up Parliament?

231
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,733
It's not too late.
He's still got another 16 hours.

232
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,152
Maybe he's just getting started.

233
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,405
Yeah?

234
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:27,908
Okay. A lead on the girl.

235
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,994
Look, don't get me wrong,
I love it. A cow getting crucified.

236
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,331
It's hysterical.
But you'll never get it approved.

237
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:37,209
You've got to rewrite it, okay? Gotta go.

238
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:40,921
I don't recall getting stood up
by a more attractive woman.

239
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,881
- Mr. Deitrich...
- Gordon, please.

240
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,592
I don't need "mister" to make
this body feel any older.

241
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,427
Gordon...

242
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:50,514
I was on my way last night,
but there were Fingermen...

243
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,266
and I got scared and went home.

244
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:56,937
Sadly, after last night,
I think our curfew will only get worse.

245
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:15,789
Gotcha.

246
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,128
- Hey, Fred.
- All that been x-rayed?

247
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,130
Nope. They're filled with bombs.

248
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:25,591
Well, wait till commercials
to set them off, okay?

249
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:29,094
- I can't believe you watch that shit.
- What?

250
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,179
Laser Lass is banging.

251
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:46,069
What's all that?

252
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:49,323
Not sure. They just arrived.
Marked for Stage 3.

253
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,158
Must be Prothero.

254
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:55,704
I wish someone had the balls to tell that
brat this station ain't his playground.

255
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:59,333
What the hell is this?

256
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,213
Just put them over there
until I can figure out what they're for.

257
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:09,635
This looks serious.
Her parents were political activists.

258
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,971
- They were detained when she was 12.
- What happened to her?

259
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,349
Juvenile Reclamation Project...

260
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,017
- for five years.
- Shit.

261
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,353
We're gonna need backup,
but keep it minimal.

262
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,854
You sure about that, sir?

263
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,439
I want a chance to talk to her...

264
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:25,150
before she disappears
into one of Creedy's black bags.

265
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,538
Who's that?

266
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:42,542
Don't piss me about. You show me ID,
or I'll get Storm Saxon on your ass.

267
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:49,883
Fucking hell.

268
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,429
Come on, let's move!

269
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,993
You two, cover these elevators.
The rest of you follow me.

270
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,705
" Attention. Attention. "

271
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:24,793
" Will all personnel please
evacuate the building. "

272
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:26,795
" This is not a drill. "

273
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:29,923
" Will all personnel evacuate
the building. "

274
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,222
What the hell's going on?

275
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,433
- It's jammed.
- Break it down.

276
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:46,606
Dominic!

277
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,025
Police! Out of the way!

278
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,320
Get out the way!

279
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,329
Damn it!

280
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:07,210
" I'll tell you what I know.
I'll tell you what I know. "

281
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:10,046
" I'll tell you what I know.
England prevails. "

282
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,843
- Clear the halls.
- Sir.

283
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,971
Help, Storm, help!

284
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,609
Don't touch it.

285
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,903
Dad, what's wrong with the telly?

286
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,629
" Good evening, London. "

287
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:54,090
" - Allow me first to apologize.... "
- That's the emergency channel!

288
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,386
" I do, like many of you, appreciate
the comforts of the everyday routine... "

289
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:02,557
" the security of the familiar,
the tranquility of repetition. "

290
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:03,850
Bloody hell.

291
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:07,521
" I enjoy them as much as any bloke.
But in the spirit of commemoration... "

292
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,730
- Who's that, Mum?
- Shh.

293
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:10,816
" Whereby important events
of the past... "

294
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,859
" usually associated
with someone's death... "

295
00:19:13,027 --> 00:19:15,111
" or the end of some awful,
bloody struggle... "

296
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,781
" are celebrated with a nice holiday... "

297
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,492
" I thought we could mark
this November the 5th... "

298
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,953
a day that is, sadly,
no longer remembered... "

299
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:27,707
" by taking time out of our daily lives
to sit down and have a little chat. "

300
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,877
" There are, of course,
those who do not want us to speak. "

301
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,337
Let me think, let me think.

302
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,881
" Even now, orders are being shouted
into telephones... "

303
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,384
" and men with guns
will soon be on their way. "

304
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:39,386
- It's Chancellor Sutler.
- Damn it!

305
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:43,890
" Why? Because while the truncheon
may be used in lieu of conversation... "

306
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:46,893
" words will always retain
their power. "

307
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,521
" Words offer the means to meaning... "

308
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,899
" and, for those who will listen,
the enunciation of truth. "

309
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,442
" And the truth is... "

310
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,029
" there is something terribly wrong
with this country, isn't there? "

311
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:01,575
You designed it, wanted it foolproof.
You said every television in London!

312
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:05,370
" Cruelty and injustice,
intolerance and oppression. "

313
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,873
" And where once
you had the freedom to object... "

314
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,833
" to think and speak
as you saw fit... "

315
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:13,253
" you now have censors and surveillance
coercing your conformity... "

316
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,256
" - and soliciting submission. "
- Cameras. We need cameras.

317
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,092
" How did this happen? Who's to blame? "

318
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:22,512
" Certainly there are those
who are more responsible than others. "

319
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,598
" And they will be held accountable. "

320
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,726
" But again, truth be told,
if you're looking for the guilty... "

321
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,604
" you need only look into a mirror. "

322
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:32,939
" I know why you did it. "

323
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,774
" I know you were afraid. "

324
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:38,486
" Who wouldn't be? War, terror, disease. "

325
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:41,364
" There were a myriad of problems
which conspired... "

326
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:44,910
" to corrupt your reason
and rob you of your common sense. "

327
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,661
" Fear got the best of you. "

328
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:51,082
" And in your panic, you turned to
the now High Chancellor Adam Sutler. "

329
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,793
" He promised you order,
he promised you peace... "

330
00:20:54,003 --> 00:20:57,714
" and all he demanded in return
was your silent, obedient consent. "

331
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,504
Inspector, they're almost through.

332
00:20:59,538 --> 00:21:01,668
" Last night,
I sought to end that silence. "

333
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,137
" Last night,
I destroyed the Old Bailey... "

334
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:07,641
" to remind this country
of what it has forgotten. "

335
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:13,146
" More than 400 years ago, a great citizen
wished to imbed the 5th of November... "

336
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:14,814
" forever in our memory. "

337
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:18,652
" His hope was to remind the world
that fairness, justice and freedom... "

338
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,820
" are more than words. "

339
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,572
" They are perspectives. "

340
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,616
" So if you've seen nothing... "

341
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:28,536
" if the crimes of this government
remain unknown to you... "

342
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:32,999
" then I would suggest that you allow
the 5th of November to pass unmarked. "

343
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:36,294
" But if you see what I see... "

344
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:41,007
" if you feel as I feel,
and if you would seek as I seek... "

345
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:44,094
" then I ask you to stand beside me,
one year from tonight... "

346
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,429
" outside the gates of Parliament. "

347
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,349
" And together, we shall give them
a 5th of November... "

348
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,686
" that shall never, ever be forgot. "

349
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:01,027
Kerosene fog.
He's using our smoke machines.

350
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,696
Cover the exits.

351
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,657
No one gets out.
The rest of you, follow me.

352
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,286
Left.

353
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,871
You go right.

354
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:13,665
Spread out.

355
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,383
Don't shoot! Please don't shoot!

356
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:27,220
Hold your fire!

357
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,395
He put masks on all of us.

358
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,813
Jesus.

359
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:38,481
- Don't shoot!
- Wait!

360
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,233
- Wait!
- Hold your fire!

361
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,569
Freeze! Nobody move!

362
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:44,988
If you're wearing a mask,
get down on your knees!

363
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,328
- Get their masks off.
- Please hurry!

364
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:56,041
There's a bomb in the control booth.

365
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,834
Oh, no.

366
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,255
- Get anyone not wearing a mask out.
- Yes, sir.

367
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:04,716
- Marshal, help carry this man.
- Sir.

368
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,426
Everyone else, let's go.

369
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,394
Good God.

370
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,938
Hurry up, you lot! Come on! Everybody out!

371
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,783
Dascomb.

372
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,787
Have you any idea how long
it would take to rebuild this facility?

373
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,039
Do you have any idea what you're doing?

374
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:37,373
Wait, wait!

375
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:41,044
Don't shoot me, please!
It's him! It's him!

376
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:44,714
On your knees! On your knees!

377
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,322
Please! Please don't hurt me!

378
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:15,995
Here we go.

379
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,629
I did it.

380
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:30,802
Freeze!

381
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,763
Get your hands on your head.
Do it now or I shoot.

382
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:40,228
I must say that I am rather astonished
by the response time of London's finest.

383
00:24:41,063 --> 00:24:44,440
I hadn't expected you to be
quite so Johnny-on-the-spot.

384
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,193
We were here before you even started.
Bad luck, chummy.

385
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:48,736
Oh, I don't know about that.

386
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:51,990
Aah!

387
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:07,505
" We're interrupting your regular program
to bring you this terrifying report... "

388
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,679
" of a terrorist takeover
of Jordan Tower... "

389
00:25:09,713 --> 00:25:11,334
" which ended only moments ago. "

390
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,721
" A psychotic terrorist,
identified only as the letter V... "

391
00:25:14,889 --> 00:25:18,850
" attacked the control booth with
high-powered explosives and weapons... "

392
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,017
" that he used against
unarmed civilians... "

393
00:25:21,051 --> 00:25:23,179
" in order to broadcast
a message of hate. "

394
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:27,901
" We've just received this footage
of a daring police raid. "

395
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,696
" Stop! Stop, stay where you are,
or we'll shoot! "

396
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,781
" Stay where you are! "

397
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:38,286
" Now, this is only an initial report... "

398
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:42,415
" but at this time, it's believed
that during this heroic raid... "

399
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,417
" the terrorist was shot and killed. "

400
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:45,793
Bollocks.

401
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:49,422
" Again, from what we've been told
by authorities, the danger is now over. "

402
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,299
" The terrorist is dead. "

403
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:58,097
Right there. What's he thinking?

404
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,808
Is he considering leaving her?

405
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:04,354
After she just saved him?

406
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:09,609
He's a terrorist. You can't expect him
to act like you or me.

407
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,819
Some part of him's human.

408
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:15,949
And, for better or worse,
she's stuck with him.

409
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:45,538
- You scared me.
- My apologies.

410
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,624
- Are you feeling all right?
- Yes, thank you.

411
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:51,210
- What is this place?
- It's my home.

412
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,881
- I call it the Shadow Gallery.
- It's beautiful.

413
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:57,967
- Where did you get all this stuff?
- Oh, here and there.

414
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:01,721
Much of it from the vaults of
the Ministry of Objectionable Materials.

415
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,848
- You stole them?
- Heavens, no.

416
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,892
Stealing implies ownership.

417
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,228
You can't steal from the censor.
I merely reclaimed them.

418
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:11,147
God, if they ever find this place....

419
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:15,276
I suspect if they do, a few bits of art
will be the least of my worries.

420
00:28:15,444 --> 00:28:17,737
You mean, after what you've done.

421
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:20,573
God, what have I done?

422
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:22,867
I maced that detective.
Why did I do that?

423
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:26,579
- You did what you thought was right.
- No, I shouldn't have done that.

424
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:28,706
I must have been out of my mind.

425
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:32,085
Is that what you really think,
or what they'd want you to think?

426
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:34,087
I think I should go.

427
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,339
- May I ask where?
- Home. I have to go home.

428
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:37,757
They're looking for you.

429
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,468
If they know where you work,
they know where you live.

430
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:45,431
- I have friends, I could stay with them.
- I'm afraid that won't work either.

431
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,768
You have to understand, Evey,
I didn't want this for either of us...

432
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,603
but I couldn't see any other way.

433
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:53,022
You were unconscious
and I had to make a decision.

434
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,387
If I had left you there,

435
00:28:54,421 --> 00:28:57,435
right now you'd be in one of
Creedy's interrogation cells.

436
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:01,447
They'd imprison you, torture you,
and, in all probability, kill you...

437
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:03,616
in the pursuit of finding me.

438
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:06,160
After what you did,
I couldn't let that happen...

439
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:10,331
so I picked you up and carried you
to the only place I knew you'd be safe:

440
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:12,125
Here, to my home.

441
00:29:12,668 --> 00:29:16,045
I won't tell anyone, I swear.
You know you can trust me.

442
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,631
I'm sorry, but I can't take that risk.

443
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,800
But I don't even know where this is.

444
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,970
You know it's underground.
You know the color of the stone.

445
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:28,182
- That'd be enough for a clever man.
- Are you saying that I have to stay here?

446
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,727
Only until I'm done. After the 5th,
I no longer think it'll matter.

447
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,855
You mean a year from now?

448
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,815
I have to stay here for a year?

449
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,985
Sorry, Evey.
I didn't know what else to do.

450
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:40,820
You should've left me alone.

451
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,322
Why didn't you just leave me alone?!

452
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,328
- Anything else on the parents?
- Yeah, it ain't good.

453
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:51,539
They were interned at Belmarsh.

454
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,416
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

455
00:29:53,584 --> 00:29:57,044
She died in a hunger strike. He died
when the military retook the shed.

456
00:29:57,379 --> 00:30:00,465
And that ain't the worst of it.
Her brother was at St. Mary's.

457
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:03,801
- Christ.
- It's nothing but bad luck here.

458
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,680
So we know her story. Now we need his.

459
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:30,703
V?

460
00:30:31,622 --> 00:30:33,289
Ah. Bonjour, mademoiselle.

461
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:36,918
I just wanted to apologize
for my reaction last night.

462
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:41,756
I understand what you did for me,
and I want you to know I am grateful.

463
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,300
Your hands.

464
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:47,261
Yes.

465
00:30:51,475 --> 00:30:53,226
There, that's better.

466
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,478
I hope I didn't put you off your appetite.

467
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:57,907
No, please. It's just...
Are you all right?

468
00:30:57,941 --> 00:30:59,431
Yes, yes, yes, I'm fine.

469
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,025
Can I ask what happened?

470
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:05,071
There was a fire. A long time ago.

471
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:07,406
Ancient history, for some.

472
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:09,408
Not really very good table conversation.

473
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:12,245
Now, would you care for a cup of tea
with your egg?

474
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:16,040
- Yes, thank you. I'm starving, actually.
- Have a seat.

475
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,631
Mmm.

476
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,759
- It's delicious.
- Good.

477
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:30,012
God, I haven't had real butter
since I was a little girl.

478
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,430
Where did you get it?

479
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,767
A government supply train
on its way to Chancellor Sutler.

480
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:38,646
- You stole this from Chancellor Sutler?
- Yes.

481
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:40,064
You're insane.

482
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:44,110
" I dare do all that may become a man.
Who dares more is none. "

483
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:46,696
- Macbeth.
- Very good.

484
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,782
My mum, she used to
read all his plays to me...

485
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,243
and ever since,
I've always wanted to act.

486
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,787
Be in plays, movies.

487
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:58,541
When I was 9, I played Viola
in Twelfth Night. Mum was very proud.

488
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:00,793
Where is your mother now?

489
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,753
She's dead.

490
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,171
I'm sorry.

491
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:08,968
Can I ask about
what you said on the telly?

492
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,720
- Did you mean it?
- Every word.

493
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:14,849
You really think blowing up Parliament's
going to make this country a better place?

494
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:17,310
There's no certainty, only opportunity.

495
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:20,021
You can be pretty certain
that if anyone does show up...

496
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,106
Creedy'll black-bag every one of them.

497
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,817
People should not be afraid
of their governments.

498
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:26,861
Governments should be afraid
of their people.

499
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:29,447
And you’ll make that happen
by blowing up a building?

500
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:34,160
The building is a symbol,
as is the act of destroying it.

501
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:36,078
Symbols are given power by people.

502
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:39,999
Alone, a symbol is meaningless,
but with enough people...

503
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,835
blowing up a building
can change the world.

504
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,796
I wish I believed that was possible.

505
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:50,509
Every time I've seen this world change,
it's always been for the worse.

506
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:53,137
I'll tell you what I know.
I know this is not a man.

507
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:55,890
What is he?

508
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:57,850
A man does not wear a mask.

509
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:01,270
- What is he?
- A man does not threaten civilians.

510
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:04,899
He's what every gutless,
freedom-hating terrorist is:

511
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:07,318
A goddamn coward!

512
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:11,822
There will be no negotiation.

513
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,492
When I arrive in the morning,
the Paddy will be gone.

514
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:18,162
I'm looking at the tape right now,
and he has no idea how to light me.

515
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,040
My nose looks like Big fucking Ben.

516
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,669
Listen to me, you bleeding sod,
England prevails because I say it does!

517
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,630
So does every lazy cunt on this show,
and that includes you.

518
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:31,050
Find another DOP
or find yourself another job.

519
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:35,137
" I'll tell you what I wish. "

520
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,264
" I wish I'd been there. "

521
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,558
" I wish I'd had the chance
for a face-to-face. "

522
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,519
" Just one chance, that's all I'd need. "

523
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,820
" This so-called V and his accomplice,
Evey Hammond... "

524
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:54,281
" Neo-demagogues,
spouting their message of hate. "

525
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:59,036
" A delusional and aberrant voice
delivering a terrorist's ultimatum. "

526
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:02,915
" An ultimatum that was met with swift
and surgically precise justice. "

527
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:05,876
- No mercy!
" - The moral, ladies and gentlemen, is: "

528
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,254
" Good guys win, bad guys lose... "

529
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:11,799
" and, as always, England prevails! "

530
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:15,803
Holy Christ! Jesus!

531
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:19,014
Good evening, Commander Prothero.

532
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,767
Oh, my God! How did you get in here?

533
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:25,062
Don't worry, I've made sure
our reunion won't be disturbed by...

534
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,440
any pesky late-night phone calls,
commander.

535
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,442
Stop. Why do you keep calling me that?

536
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:34,363
That was your title, remember?
When we first met, all those years ago.

537
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:36,323
You wore a uniform in those days.

538
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:41,036
You.

539
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:45,916
- It is you.
- The Ghost of Christmas Past.

540
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:57,887
- Yeah?
" - Finch, it's Dascomb. "

541
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,639
- Dascomb.
" - I've already called the chancellor. "

542
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:03,510
" - We have to get control
of the situation. "

543
00:35:03,544 --> 00:35:04,676
What situation?

544
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:10,191
Chancellor Sutler agreed, for obvious
reasons, we have to keep this discreet.

545
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,943
In the wrong light,
the loss of the Voice of London...

546
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,154
could be devastating
to our credibility.

547
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,115
Perhaps a stroke?

548
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,035
No, no, it's too horrific.

549
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:24,955
A quiet, dignified death in his sleep.

550
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:28,876
- We got any eyes or ears on this?
- No, camcos were cut.

551
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:33,547
It's the same m.o. as before.
But we got an elevator log ID.

552
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:37,092
- Let me guess.
- She's in deep, inspector.

553
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:39,929
V?

554
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:48,145
My fat, metal friend.

555
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:02,701
Mondego.

556
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:11,418
Oh, God. I hope I didn't wake you.

557
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,214
No, I just thought you were fighting.
I mean, for real.

558
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,715
My favorite film:

559
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:21,345
The Count of Monte Cristo,
with Robert Donat as Edmond Dantes.

560
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:24,723
" It is not my sword, Mondego,
but your past that disarmed you. "

561
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,518
It gets me every time.

562
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:29,728
- Never seen it.
- Really?

563
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,148
- Would you like to?
- Does it have a happy ending?

564
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:35,568
As only celluloid can deliver.

565
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:37,444
Okay.

566
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:39,572
Put the sword away.

567
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:42,032
Forensics just wrapped.

568
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:45,870
No prints, no hair, no fibers.
The guy is like a ghost.

569
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,872
You won't believe
what they found on Prothero.

570
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,082
- Drugs?
- Could've started his own hospital.

571
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,834
- Interesting.
- Why?

572
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:55,421
Did you know Lewis Prothero was
one of the richest men in the country...

573
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:57,339
before he was the Voice of London?

574
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:59,967
- Drugs?
- Legal ones.

575
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:02,928
Major stockholder
in Viadoxic Pharmaceutical.

576
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:07,308
Viadoxic and St. Mary's
in less than a week. Coincidence?

577
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:11,020
When you're at this as long as I've been,
you stop believing in coincidence.

578
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:13,522
" May we come up? "

579
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:17,234
- You find your own tree.
" - You find your own tree. "

580
00:37:22,616 --> 00:37:24,742
- Did you like it?
- Yeah.

581
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,746
- But it made me feel sorry for Mercedes.
- Why?

582
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:32,750
Because he cared more about revenge
than he did about her.

583
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:37,463
" Nationwide were devastated
as news of the most popular... "

584
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:38,839
Wait. What's this?

585
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,717
" Most awarded stars
in the history of the BTN... "

586
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:44,970
" a man known to the entire nation
as "The Voice of London"... "

587
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:48,015
" passed away late last night
from apparent heart failure. "

588
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:52,394
- She's lying.
- How do you know?

589
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:55,564
She blinks a lot when she does a story
she knows is false.

590
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:57,900
" It came as no surprise
to those who knew him... "

591
00:37:58,068 --> 00:37:59,818
" that his body was at his office... "

592
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:03,697
" where he often worked long hours
after everyone else had gone home. "

593
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:06,408
" Lewis, you will be sorely missed. "

594
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:16,085
V, yesterday I couldn't find my ID.

595
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:17,962
You didn't take it, did you?

596
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:21,173
Would you prefer a lie or the truth?

597
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:25,094
Did you have anything to do with that?

598
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:28,180
- Yes, I killed him.
- You....

599
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:29,848
- Oh, God.
- You're upset.

600
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:32,476
I'm upset?
You just said you killed Lewis Prothero.

601
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:36,021
I might have killed the Fingermen that
attacked you. I heard no objection.

602
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:38,691
- What?
- Violence can be used for good.

603
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:41,610
- What are you talking about?
- Justice.

604
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:48,075
Oh, I see.

605
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:51,078
There's no court in this country
for men like Prothero.

606
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,581
And are you going to kill more people?

607
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:57,334
Yes.

608
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,795
Take a look at this.

609
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:02,423
Prothero's military record.

610
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,758
What do you see?

611
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:11,890
Iraq, Kurdistan, Syria,
before and after, Sudan.

612
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,684
- Busy boy.
- But after all that...

613
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:17,521
they put him in charge
of a detention facility at Larkhill.

614
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:20,482
Well, no good deed goes unpunished.

615
00:39:21,735 --> 00:39:24,611
You think there's a connection
between our boy and Larkhill?

616
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:28,657
It might explain the connection
between him and the Hammond girl.

617
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:33,162
Problem is, I can't find
any other record of it.

618
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:38,667
Larkhill? Larkhill? I cannot recall
that particular facility, inspector.

619
00:39:38,835 --> 00:39:42,212
- You're welcome to review our records.
- We've been through your records.

620
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,924
All it says is that there was
a detention facility at Larkhill...

621
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:48,594
approximately 10 miles
north of Salisbury.

622
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:49,928
Well, there you have it.

623
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,433
This is a matter of some urgency, major.

624
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:57,770
We need to know if there was anything
different about this facility.

625
00:39:58,146 --> 00:40:00,272
I'm sorry, inspector,
I simply cannot recall.

626
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,192
Was there a specific profile
for those being sent there?

627
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:06,445
- Usual undesirables, I should think.
- But do you know?

628
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,531
- Of course not. I wasn't stationed there.
- Do you know who was?

629
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:12,910
I cannot recall specific names,
but if you look through our records...

630
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:17,623
Your records are either deleted,
omitted or missing.

631
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:19,708
As head of the Detention Program
at that...

632
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:23,754
Before you go further, let me remind you
things were very chaotic back then.

633
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,632
Now we don't have the problems
we had back then.

634
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,384
We all did what we had to do.

635
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,805
And in those circumstances,
we did the best we could.

636
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,807
That's all I have to say about that.

637
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:42,898
You can do this.

638
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:54,493
Hi.

639
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,704
I've been thinking....

640
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:00,999
There's something I want to ask you...

641
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:05,003
but I don't think you’ll understand why
unless you know a few things about me.

642
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:10,759
My father was a writer.
You would have liked him.

643
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:14,096
He used to say " artists used lies
to tell the truth... "

644
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:16,682
" while politicians used them
to cover the truth up. "

645
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:19,017
A man after my own heart.

646
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:21,854
He always told the best stories.

647
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:25,357
Until my brother died.

648
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:29,653
That was when everything changed.

649
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:33,991
My brother was one of the students
at St. Mary's.

650
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:37,995
After he died,
my parents became political.

651
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:43,542
They protested the war
and the Reclamation.

652
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,003
When Sutler was appointed
high chancellor...

653
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:48,380
they were at the riot in Leeds.

654
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:50,549
I watched on the television...

655
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:53,135
thinking I was going
to see my parents killed.

656
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,180
I remember them arguing at night.

657
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,683
Mum wanted to leave the country.
Dad refused.

658
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:02,895
He said
" if we ran away, they would win. "

659
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,855
Win, like...

660
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,190
it was a game.

661
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:10,360
Evey, quick, hide!

662
00:42:25,335 --> 00:42:27,252
- Mummy!
- Evey!

663
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,837
I never saw them again.

664
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:33,175
It was like those black bags erased them
from the face of the earth.

665
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,093
I'm sorry, Evey.

666
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:37,888
No, I'm the one that's sorry.

667
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:40,349
Sorry I'm not a stronger person.

668
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:43,518
Sorry I'm not like my parents.
I wish I was...

669
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,396
but I'm not.

670
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:50,317
I wish I wasn't afraid all the time...

671
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:53,403
but I am.

672
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:57,115
I know this world is screwed up.
Believe me, I know it better than most.

673
00:42:57,325 --> 00:43:02,120
Which is why I wanted to ask, if there is
anything I can do to help make it right...

674
00:43:03,373 --> 00:43:05,249
please let me know.

675
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,084
If you wish.

676
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:17,302
Do you really think
you'll find something here?

677
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,971
Worth a shot.

678
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,932
One thing is true of all governments:

679
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,894
The most reliable records are tax records.

680
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:35,696
It appears that the original
electronic records have all been lost.

681
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:39,783
Probably during the Reclamation.
A lot of things went missing back then.

682
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:43,954
But I found this hard copy
filed in the cold vault.

683
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,373
Everything we've got on Larkhill
is in there.

684
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:49,001
Thanks. This is a great help.

685
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:03,974
" By the power of truth, I, while living,
have conquered the universe. "

686
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:07,269
- Personal motto?
- From Faust.

687
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:09,855
That's about trying
to cheat the devil, isn't it?

688
00:44:10,023 --> 00:44:12,190
It is. And speaking of the devil...

689
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,152
I was wondering if your offer to help
was still standing.

690
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,654
- Of course.
- It appears unforeseen circumstances...

691
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:20,615
have accelerated my original plan.

692
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:24,536
As a result, I'm in need of someone
with some theatrical skill.

693
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:25,954
I'll do my best.

694
00:44:26,456 --> 00:44:28,206
I believe you will.

695
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:36,715
Another doctor. Why does a
detention facility need so many doctors?

696
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,759
I don't know, but this is interesting.

697
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:42,387
The highest-paid person
at the camp was a priest.

698
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:45,682
- Really?
- Yeah, Father Lilliman.

699
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:49,686
- Lilliman.
- Was paid almost 200 grand a month.

700
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,064
Now, that is interesting.

701
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:56,651
Looks like he was promoted.
He's a bishop now.

702
00:45:00,073 --> 00:45:02,032
- Your Grace.
- Oh, Denis.

703
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,909
- Has everything been arranged?
- Yes.

704
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:06,203
I've just received
your Interlink itinerary.

705
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:09,247
You should arrive in Perth
in time for Mass.

706
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:10,916
You're most diligent, Denis...

707
00:45:11,084 --> 00:45:15,045
a noble example for all those
who labor in the name of our Lord, but...

708
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:17,756
- Your Grace?
- It wasn't labor I was speaking of.

709
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,967
It was, rather, my final remittance
that I was interested in.

710
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,387
My last little joy.

711
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,305
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

712
00:45:26,516 --> 00:45:29,810
She has arrived, but there was
some confusion at the agency.

713
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:33,230
They've sent a new girl who,
I'm afraid, is a little older than usual.

714
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:34,773
Older?

715
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,109
Oh, dear. She's not too old, I trust?

716
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,528
That is for Your Grace to decide.

717
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:54,292
- Oh, my.
- Your Grace.

718
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,924
To think that I doubted your loveliness
for an instant.

719
00:46:02,844 --> 00:46:05,512
" Mea culpa ", my child.

720
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,013
" Mea culpa. "

721
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:15,981
Your Grace, we don't have much time
and I have to tell you something.

722
00:46:16,149 --> 00:46:20,193
A confession?
I love the confessional game.

723
00:46:20,695 --> 00:46:22,279
Tell me your sins.

724
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:24,281
This isn't a game, Your Grace.

725
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:26,741
Someone's coming.
I think he means to kill you.

726
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,660
- I'm sorry?
- I'm telling you this...

727
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:31,413
because I want some kind
of protection or amnesty.

728
00:46:31,581 --> 00:46:35,250
I had nothing to do with the Bailey
and made a mistake in the Jordan Tower.

729
00:46:35,418 --> 00:46:38,503
- I think this should balance it out.
- What are you talking about?

730
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,547
I'm Evey Hammond. I'm...

731
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:43,925
I've been the prisoner of the terrorist V
for the past several weeks.

732
00:46:44,093 --> 00:46:47,387
I'm telling you that any moment,
he's going to come through that door.

733
00:46:47,597 --> 00:46:50,932
I unlocked the window in the room
where Denis told me to get ready.

734
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,393
Wonderful!

735
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,854
It's a game I've never played!

736
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,981
What a delightful mind you have.

737
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:00,025
I hope the rest of you
is just as interesting.

738
00:47:00,193 --> 00:47:03,445
- No, please, you have to believe me.
- Oh, I do, I do, I do.

739
00:47:03,613 --> 00:47:05,697
Let me show you
the firmness of my beliefs.

740
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:07,324
Stop it! Get off of me!

741
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:09,618
Seems I've captured a dangerous terrorist.

742
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,870
Now, how best to procure her confession?

743
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:13,580
Oh!

744
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:16,958
You little bitch.
You fucking little whore!

745
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,505
- Reverend.
- Oh, my God.

746
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,381
She wasn't lying. It is you.

747
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:25,550
I'm sorry.

748
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:27,427
- I had to.
- Evey!

749
00:47:32,225 --> 00:47:34,351
" And thus I clothe my naked villainy... "

750
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:37,562
" with old odd ends
stolen forth from holy writ... "

751
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:40,857
" and seem a saint,
when most I play the devil. "

752
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:42,984
Oh, please, have mercy.

753
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,070
Oh, not tonight, Bishop.

754
00:47:45,238 --> 00:47:46,947
" Not tonight. "

755
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:51,211
" Don't do this, I beg of you. "

756
00:47:51,244 --> 00:47:53,411
Well, then. Children's hour at the abbey.

757
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:55,580
Open your mouth and stick out your tongue.

758
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:59,125
- What the...?
" - I don't want to die! "

759
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:02,462
This is Surveillance 1-09.
We have an emergency.

760
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:08,969
Run every name in that file.
I want the whereabouts of all of them.

761
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,804
- Tonight.
- Yes, sir.

762
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,557
Pucker up, here comes the Finger.

763
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:17,018
Yeah. Get going. I'll handle him.

764
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,149
Creedy.

765
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:24,693
What are you doing here?

766
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:29,739
Several prominent party members
have been murdered, chief inspector.

767
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:34,119
This is no ordinary situation and requires
more than your ordinary attention.

768
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:37,122
The chancellor demanded
my immediate involvement.

769
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:40,292
It'll be hard to investigate
if you're detaining all my witnesses.

770
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,670
The security of information is paramount.

771
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:45,672
In these volatile times...

772
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,675
mistakes like Jordan Tower
can no longer be tolerated...

773
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:51,219
if, indeed, Jordan Tower was an accident.

774
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:53,638
- What does that mean?
- Terrorist seems to have...

775
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:56,433
a rather intimate understanding
of our system.

776
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:59,394
The chancellor suspects
there might be an informer.

777
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:02,105
Are you saying I'm under surveillance,
Mr. Creedy?

778
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:04,024
At this time, it would behoove you...

779
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:09,195
to cease any investigation of matters
that have long since passed...

780
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:12,782
and concentrate on the concerns
of our present.

781
00:49:13,451 --> 00:49:14,743
You mean Larkhill?

782
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:18,496
Major Wilson is a friend
of the high chancellor.

783
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:21,916
- His loyalty is not in question.
- But mine is?

784
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:26,004
Your mother was Irish, wasn't she?

785
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:29,841
Terrible what St. Mary's
did to Ireland, wasn't it?

786
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,678
I've been a party member for 27 years.

787
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:36,181
If I were you, chief inspector...

788
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:38,516
I'd find the terrorist...

789
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:40,602
and I'd find him soon.

790
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,523
Please.

791
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:51,821
Evey? Good God!

792
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,532
I'm sorry. I didn't know where else to go.

793
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:59,496
Yes, well, you better come inside
before someone sees you.

794
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,632
- Cheers.
- I know every cop's looking for me.

795
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,468
I know it's horrible of me
to put you in this situation.

796
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:16,054
- Evey...
- You could be in terrible trouble.

797
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,722
Evey, listen to me.

798
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:21,768
If the government searched my house,
you would be the least of my problems.

799
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,565
You trusted me.

800
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:30,819
It would be terrible manners
for me not to trust you.

801
00:50:44,083 --> 00:50:46,584
Oh, my God. That's God Save the Queen.

802
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:49,462
My parents took me to it
when they hung it at Gallery 12.

803
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:53,717
- I thought Sutler had it destroyed.
- He believes he did.

804
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:56,678
Cost me more than this house,
but no matter how bad I feel...

805
00:50:56,846 --> 00:50:58,680
it always cheers me up.

806
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:04,853
- What is that?
- It's a copy of the Koran, 14th century.

807
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,188
- Are you a Muslim?
- No, I'm in television.

808
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:09,399
But why would you keep it?

809
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:12,777
I don't have to be Muslim to find
the images beautiful, poetry moving.

810
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:14,946
Is it worth it?
If they found that here....

811
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:17,407
I told you,
you'd be the least of my worries.

812
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,993
Thank you, Gordon.

813
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:22,287
- Thank you so much.
- It's all right.

814
00:51:22,455 --> 00:51:25,957
This whole thing started the night
he blew up the Old Bailey.

815
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:28,293
I was on my way here, and....

816
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:29,961
Ah.

817
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:31,588
Yes.

818
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:37,343
You see, we are both fugitives
in our own way.

819
00:51:38,179 --> 00:51:39,637
- But...
- You're wondering why...

820
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:42,348
you were invited here to supper
in the first place...

821
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:46,603
if my appetites were
for less conventional fare.

822
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:50,315
Unfortunately, a man in my position
is expected to entertain...

823
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:53,109
young and attractive ladies
like yourself.

824
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:57,071
Because in this world,
if I were to invite who I desired...

825
00:51:57,239 --> 00:52:01,201
I would undoubtedly find myself
without a home, let alone a TV show.

826
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:04,370
- I'm sorry.
- Not as sorry as I am.

827
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:07,540
The truth is, after so many years...

828
00:52:07,708 --> 00:52:11,169
you begin to lose
more than just your appetite.

829
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:15,340
You wear a mask for so long,
you forget who you were beneath it.

830
00:52:16,884 --> 00:52:21,179
I'm sorry, chief inspector.
Same basic toxicology as Prothero.

831
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:24,390
You could get these poisons
from any house in London.

832
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,101
Thanks, Delia.

833
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:31,272
Any leads on finding this guy?

834
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,776
Nothing yet. But there's something else
you can help me with.

835
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:40,573
You started as a botanist, didn't you?

836
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:44,452
It's... It's a Scarlet Carson.

837
00:52:45,955 --> 00:52:48,289
They're believed to be extinct.

838
00:52:49,792 --> 00:52:51,417
He leaves them at the crime scenes.

839
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:54,254
I'd appreciate it
if you could have a look at it.

840
00:52:54,463 --> 00:52:57,006
Any information could be helpful.

841
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,342
Of course.

842
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,136
Excuse me.

843
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,097
Yeah?

844
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:07,141
" I just finished
going through the file, inspector. "

845
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,560
" You better get back here. "

846
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,186
Yeah, okay.

847
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:15,066
- My God. He's killed them all.
- All but one.

848
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,695
- Who is she?
- Not sure.

849
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:21,406
She's clearly one of the people
in charge at Larkhill.

850
00:53:21,574 --> 00:53:25,076
But after they shut it down,
she disappeared for two years.

851
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:27,871
Till she applied for an overseas visa,
which was denied.

852
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,914
Running away?

853
00:53:30,082 --> 00:53:34,252
Probably, because after that,
all record of her seems to stop.

854
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,796
- She changed her name.
- That's what I'm guessing.

855
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:40,049
I put a call in to the registry,
but I haven't heard back.

856
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:43,553
- It's late, or early.
- Call them again. I want that name.

857
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:57,317
What? Are you sure about that?

858
00:53:57,818 --> 00:53:59,235
Okay. Thank you.

859
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:03,615
Dr. Diana Stanton changed her name
to Delia Surridge.

860
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:06,034
- The coroner?
- Yeah.

861
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:08,286
Jesus, I just saw her.

862
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:19,172
It's you, isn't it?

863
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,926
- You've come to kill me.
- Yes.

864
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:26,304
Thank God.

865
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:31,017
" I'm sorry,
I can't get a response from that number. "

866
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:33,019
" There's a problem with the connection. "

867
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:35,021
Jesus Christ.

868
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:37,023
He's there.

869
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:41,444
After what happened,
after what they did...

870
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:43,947
I thought about killing myself.

871
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:49,327
But I knew that one day
you'd come for me.

872
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:52,830
I didn't know what they were going to do.

873
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:55,208
I swear to you.

874
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,001
Read my journal.

875
00:54:57,169 --> 00:55:00,421
What they did was only possible
because of you.

876
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:05,885
Oppenheimer was able to change
more than the course of a war.

877
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:08,888
He changed the entire course
of human history.

878
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:12,725
Is it wrong to hold on
to that kind of hope?

879
00:55:12,935 --> 00:55:16,062
I have not come for what you hoped to do.

880
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:18,106
I've come for what you did.

881
00:55:19,692 --> 00:55:20,900
It's funny.

882
00:55:21,068 --> 00:55:23,903
I was given one of your roses today.

883
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:28,366
I wasn't sure you were the terrorist
until I saw it.

884
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:34,205
What a strange coincidence,
that I should be given one today.

885
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,875
There are no coincidences, Delia.

886
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:41,045
Only the illusion of coincidence.

887
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:43,214
I have another rose.

888
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:46,718
And this one is for you.

889
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:56,227
- You're going to kill me now?
- I killed you 1 0 minutes ago...

890
00:55:57,021 --> 00:55:58,813
while you slept.

891
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:02,608
- Is there any pain?
- No.

892
00:56:02,818 --> 00:56:04,193
Thank you.

893
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:09,741
Is it meaningless to apologize?

894
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:11,242
Never.

895
00:56:12,453 --> 00:56:14,412
I'm so sorry.

896
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,769
Damn it.

897
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:43,107
The terrorist obviously
wanted us to have it.

898
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:46,861
He wanted us to know the story,
or at least a part of it.

899
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:50,073
" Am I to understand that you have read
this document, inspector? "

900
00:56:50,282 --> 00:56:52,325
- Yes, sir.
" - Has anyone else read it? "

901
00:56:52,393 --> 00:56:53,212
No, sir.

902
00:56:53,246 --> 00:56:55,402
" - Then let me make
this perfectly clear. "

903
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:59,040
" The contents of this document
are a matter of national security... "

904
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:01,192
" constituting an assault
on the character... "

905
00:57:01,226 --> 00:57:03,119
" of several important party members... "

906
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:06,714
" as well as a blatant violation
of the Articles of Allegiance. "

907
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:09,801
" As the authenticity of this document
cannot be verified... "

908
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:13,805
" it could be an elaborate forgery
created by the terrorist... "

909
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:17,642
" as easily as it could be the deranged
fantasy of a former party member... "

910
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:19,977
" who resigned
for psychological reasons. "

911
00:57:20,479 --> 00:57:23,064
" Any discussion of this document
or its contents... "

912
00:57:23,232 --> 00:57:26,150
" will be regarded, at the very least,
as an act of sedition... "

913
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:28,820
" if not a willful act of treason. "

914
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:32,323
" - Is that understood, Mr. Finch?
- Yes, sir. "

915
00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:35,159
" You would do well, inspector... "

916
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:37,745
" to put it out of your mind. "

917
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,714
" May 23rd. "

918
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:52,885
" My first batch of subjects
arrived today... "

919
00:57:53,929 --> 00:57:56,806
" and I have to admit
that I'm very excited. "

920
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:02,770
" This could be the dawn of a new age. "

921
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:05,690
" Nuclear power is meaningless... "

922
00:58:05,858 --> 00:58:08,860
" in a world where a virus
can kill an entire population... "

923
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,070
" and leave its wealth intact. "

924
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:14,365
" - Stay together!
- Come on, move! "

925
00:58:14,867 --> 00:58:16,868
" May 27th. "

926
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:20,163
" Commander Prothero toured the lab
with a priest, Father Lilliman... "

927
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:24,167
" who I was told is here to monitor
for Rules and Rights violations. "

928
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:28,588
" It made me nervous, but the commander
assured me there wouldn't be a problem. "

929
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:30,631
" June 2nd. "

930
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:32,953
" I keep wondering if these people knew "

931
00:58:32,987 --> 00:58:35,044
" how they might be helping
their country... "

932
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:37,513
" if they would act any differently. "

933
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:41,601
" They're so weak and pathetic.
They never look you in the eye. "

934
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:44,270
" I find myself hating them. "

935
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,275
" August the 18th. "

936
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:53,279
" Of the original four dozen,
over 75 percent are now deceased. "

937
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:58,993
" No controllable pattern
has yet emerged. "

938
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:02,496
" September the 18th. "

939
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:05,750
" There is one case that continues
to give me hope. "

940
00:59:05,918 --> 00:59:08,050
" He exhibits none of the immune-system "

941
00:59:08,084 --> 00:59:10,621
" pathologies the other
subjects developed. "

942
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:12,913
" I've discovered cellular anomalies "

943
00:59:12,947 --> 00:59:15,292
"  in his blood that I've been unable
to categorize. "

944
00:59:15,427 --> 00:59:17,261
" The mutations seem
to have triggered... "

945
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:21,390
" the abnormal development
of basic kinesthesia and reflexes. "

946
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,726
" The subject said
he could no longer remember... "

947
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:26,604
" who he was or where he was from. "

948
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:30,566
" Whoever he was,
he is now the key to our dream... "

949
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:34,320
" and the hope that all of this
will not have been in vain. "

950
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,031
" November the 5th. "

951
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:42,662
" It started last night,
around midnight. "

952
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:46,707
" The first explosions tore open
the entire medical section. "

953
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:50,711
" All my work, gone. "

954
00:59:50,879 --> 00:59:54,924
" I was trying to understand how
it could've happened when I saw him. "

955
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:57,301
" The man from room 5. "

956
00:59:57,469 --> 00:59:58,719
" He looked at me. "

957
00:59:58,887 --> 01:00:02,306
" Not with eyes. There were no eyes. "

958
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:05,017
" But I know he was looking at me
because I felt it. "

959
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:14,610
" Oh, God... "

960
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:16,487
" what have I done? "

961
01:00:45,726 --> 01:00:48,144
Bonjour, mademoiselle.

962
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,062
What is that you're making?

963
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:52,773
We called it "eggie in the basket."
My mum made them.

964
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:54,775
- This is weird.
- What?

965
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:58,404
The first morning I was with him,
he made me eggs just like this.

966
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:00,865
- Really?
- I swear.

967
01:01:01,033 --> 01:01:05,828
That is a strange coincidence.
Although there's an obvious explanation.

968
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:07,913
- There is?
- Yes, Evey.

969
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:09,915
I am V.

970
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:11,542
At last you know the truth.

971
01:01:12,044 --> 01:01:13,419
You're stunned, I know.

972
01:01:13,587 --> 01:01:17,214
Hard to believe, isn't it, that beneath
this wrinkled, well-fed exterior...

973
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:22,595
there lies a dangerous killing machine
with a fetish for Fawkesian masks.

974
01:01:22,763 --> 01:01:24,347
"Viva la revolución".

975
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:25,890
That is not funny, Gordon.

976
01:01:26,058 --> 01:01:28,726
Yeah, I know.
I'm useless without a studio audience.

977
01:01:29,353 --> 01:01:31,479
I've seen people go to jail
for less than that.

978
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:33,564
Of course, he was right, wasn't he?

979
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:37,068
There is something wrong
with this country.

980
01:01:53,168 --> 01:01:54,668
Morning, inspector.

981
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:58,172
You're at it early.

982
01:01:59,758 --> 01:02:03,469
Is something wrong?
You don't look so good, sir.

983
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:14,188
I wanna ask a question, Dominic.

984
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,983
I don't care if you answer me or not.

985
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:21,112
I just wanna say this aloud.

986
01:02:22,364 --> 01:02:26,117
But I need to know that this question
will not leave this office.

987
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:28,619
Yeah, of course, inspector, but...

988
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:31,122
Because of the terrorist?

989
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:33,916
No.

990
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:38,170
So, what is it, chief? What's going on?

991
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:44,510
The question I want to ask
is about St. Mary's...

992
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:46,762
and Three Waters.

993
01:02:48,932 --> 01:02:53,310
The question that's kept me up
for the last 24 hours...

994
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,313
the question I have to ask, is:

995
01:02:57,816 --> 01:03:00,693
What if the worst...

996
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:04,989
the most horrifying biological attack
in this country's history...

997
01:03:05,157 --> 01:03:08,909
was not the work
of religious extremists?

998
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:12,746
I don't understand. We know it was.
They were caught. They confessed.

999
01:03:12,914 --> 01:03:15,040
And they were executed. I know.

1000
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:18,210
And maybe that's really what happened.

1001
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:23,174
But I see this chain of events...

1002
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:28,095
these coincidences, and I have to ask:

1003
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:29,847
What if that isn't what happened?

1004
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,975
What if someone else unleashed that virus?

1005
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:37,188
What if someone else
killed all those people?

1006
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:39,690
Would you really wanna know who it was?

1007
01:03:40,692 --> 01:03:42,109
Sure.

1008
01:03:42,277 --> 01:03:44,612
Even if it was someone
working for this government?

1009
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:48,115
That's my question.

1010
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:51,368
If our own government was responsible...

1011
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:55,831
for what happened at St. Mary's
and Three Waters...

1012
01:03:57,792 --> 01:04:00,085
if our own government
was responsible...

1013
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:04,381
for the deaths
of almost 100,000 people...

1014
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:08,802
would you really wanna know?

1015
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:11,430
This has to be the bloody
coldest March in years.

1016
01:04:11,598 --> 01:04:14,099
Keep talking like that,
we'll lose our party status.

1017
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:16,185
They're a pack of lying hypocrites!

1018
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:17,895
Keep it down, will you?

1019
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:25,069
Based on random audio sweeps,
I've projected that right now...

1020
01:04:25,237 --> 01:04:28,447
80 percent of the public
believe the terrorist is still alive.

1021
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,408
We're also showing
a 12-percent increase...

1022
01:04:31,618 --> 01:04:35,037
over last month's positive mention
in all four quadrants.

1023
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:38,707
- Mr. Creedy?
- We're handling it as best we can.

1024
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,502
Arrests are as high as they've been
since the Reclamation.

1025
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:44,171
" I want more than arrests.
I want results. "

1026
01:04:48,343 --> 01:04:50,594
- What's all this about?
- I'm celebrating.

1027
01:04:50,762 --> 01:04:52,888
Celebrating what?

1028
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:56,141
I think this could be
the best show we've ever done.

1029
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:59,103
Very good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1030
01:04:59,271 --> 01:05:02,523
" Listen, we've got an extraordinary
show for you tonight. "

1031
01:05:02,816 --> 01:05:06,110
" You're not gonna believe it.
As a matter of fact, I don't think I do. "

1032
01:05:06,278 --> 01:05:08,779
" Will you please give
a very warm welcome... "

1033
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:12,324
" to our own Chancellor Adam Sutler! "

1034
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:18,414
- No way!
- No, it can't be!

1035
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:23,794
We threw out the censor-approved script
and shot one I wrote this morning.

1036
01:05:23,962 --> 01:05:25,546
Oh, my God.

1037
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,810
" Chancellor, chancellor, chancellor... "

1038
01:05:39,978 --> 01:05:42,813
" I understand you've been under
tremendous strain lately... "

1039
01:05:42,981 --> 01:05:46,150
" since the beginning
of this whole terrorism business... "

1040
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:48,454
" and we thought it would be
a nice idea "

1041
01:05:48,488 --> 01:05:50,437
" to try and help you relax. Girls? "

1042
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:59,830
" Ah! Warm milk. There's nothing better. "

1043
01:05:59,998 --> 01:06:03,042
" I understand you enjoy a glass
every night, chancellor. "

1044
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:05,002
" Since I was a boy. "

1045
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:07,671
" But you're wrong, Mr. Deitrich. "

1046
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:11,634
" - The terrorist was never a concern.
- Oh, really? "

1047
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:14,011
" - Chancellor, chancellor...
- It's him. "

1048
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:17,431
" Are you saying that he's not still alive
and active? "

1049
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:20,267
" The terrorist has been neutralized. "

1050
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:24,647
" Oh, my God! Chancellor, look! "

1051
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,440
" The terrorist! "

1052
01:06:27,025 --> 01:06:28,525
" The terrorist! "

1053
01:06:30,278 --> 01:06:31,987
" Get him! "

1054
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:36,241
" Oh, dear. "

1055
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:57,304
" At last! "

1056
01:06:57,472 --> 01:07:01,392
" And now, for all the world to see. "

1057
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,811
" It's him! "

1058
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:08,982
" Unhand me! I am your chancellor! "

1059
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:12,861
" How dare you! I am the chancellor! "

1060
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:15,072
" Imposter! "

1061
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:23,747
" Soldiers! That man is the terrorist! "

1062
01:07:23,915 --> 01:07:26,834
" - I order you to shoot that traitor!
- Liar! "

1063
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:28,043
" - Faker!
- Fraud! "

1064
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:30,087
" - Ready!
- Aim! "

1065
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:31,714
" - Fire!
- Fire! "

1066
01:07:43,601 --> 01:07:45,602
What are they gonna do, fine us?

1067
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:49,231
Big deal. We've got
the most-watched show on air.

1068
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:51,900
Well, you're my agent,
that's what I pay you for.

1069
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:53,944
Protect me.

1070
01:07:54,112 --> 01:07:55,946
I should've hired him to be my mother.

1071
01:07:56,114 --> 01:07:58,866
- You're mad.
- Either that or I wasn't breast-fed.

1072
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:02,035
- Is everything a joke to you?
- Only the things that matter.

1073
01:08:02,203 --> 01:08:05,456
- What if they come after you?
- I tell you what's gonna happen.

1074
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:08,792
I'll have to make some kind of apology,
do some boring fundraiser.

1075
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:13,964
In the meantime, our ratings will go
through the roof. It'll be fine. Trust me.

1076
01:08:21,389 --> 01:08:22,639
Gordon?

1077
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:26,894
Quick, Evey, hide!

1078
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:45,204
Not so funny now, is it, funnyman?

1079
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:37,214
- Gotcha.
- No, no.

1080
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:53,814
Do you know why you're here, Evey Hammond?

1081
01:09:55,066 --> 01:09:56,316
Please.

1082
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:58,944
You've been charged
with three counts of murder...

1083
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:02,906
the bombing of government property,
conspiracy to commit terrorism...

1084
01:10:03,074 --> 01:10:07,995
treason and sedition, the penalty
for which is death by firing squad.

1085
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:14,585
You have one chance,
and only one chance, to save your life.

1086
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:18,755
You must tell us the identity
or whereabouts...

1087
01:10:18,965 --> 01:10:20,757
of code name V.

1088
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:24,094
If your information leads
to his capture...

1089
01:10:24,262 --> 01:10:28,056
you will be released
from this facility immediately.

1090
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,809
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

1091
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:34,104
You can return to your life, Miss Hammond.

1092
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:38,609
All you have to do is cooperate.

1093
01:10:43,031 --> 01:10:44,615
Process her.

1094
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:53,660
" I know there's no way
I can convince you... "

1095
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:56,621
" this is not one of their tricks,
but I don't care. "

1096
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:58,582
" I am me. "

1097
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:00,500
" My name is Valerie. "

1098
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:05,714
" I don't think I'll live much longer.
I wanted to tell someone about my life. "

1099
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:10,260
" This is the only autobiography
that I will ever write and, God... "

1100
01:13:10,762 --> 01:13:13,180
" I'm writing it on toilet paper. "

1101
01:13:15,641 --> 01:13:18,852
" I was born in Nottingham in 1985. "

1102
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:21,396
" I don't remember much
of those early years... "

1103
01:13:21,564 --> 01:13:23,815
" but I do remember the rain. "

1104
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:26,443
" My grandmother owned a farm
in Tottle Brook... "

1105
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:29,488
" and she used to tell me
that God was in the rain. "

1106
01:13:29,655 --> 01:13:32,449
" I passed my 11 Plus
and went to girls' grammar. "

1107
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:35,327
" It was at school
that I met my first girlfriend. "

1108
01:13:35,495 --> 01:13:37,162
" Her name was Sarah. "

1109
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:39,289
" It was her wrists. "

1110
01:13:39,457 --> 01:13:41,166
" They were beautiful. "

1111
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:46,046
" I thought we would
love each other forever. "

1112
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:48,924
" I remember our teacher telling us... "

1113
01:13:49,092 --> 01:13:51,802
" that it was an adolescent phase
that people outgrew. "

1114
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:53,512
" Sarah did. "

1115
01:13:55,056 --> 01:13:56,890
" I didn't. "

1116
01:13:57,100 --> 01:14:01,228
" In 2002, I fell in love
with a girl named Christina. "

1117
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:02,896
" That year I came out to my parents. "

1118
01:14:04,524 --> 01:14:07,442
" I couldn't have done it
without Chris holding my hand. "

1119
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:11,488
" My father wouldn't look at me.
He told me to go and never come back. "

1120
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:14,616
" My mother said nothing. "

1121
01:14:15,535 --> 01:14:19,496
" But I'd only told them the truth.
Was that so selfish? "

1122
01:14:20,123 --> 01:14:24,501
" Our integrity sells for so little,
but it is all we really have. "

1123
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,837
" It is the very last inch of us. "

1124
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:29,548
" But within that inch... "

1125
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:30,966
" we are free. "

1126
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:35,303
It ends whenever you want it to.

1127
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:38,056
- Just tell us where he is.
- I don't know.

1128
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:17,137
" I'd always known
what I wanted to do with my life... "

1129
01:15:17,305 --> 01:15:22,517
" and in 2015 I starred
in my first film, The Salt Flats. "

1130
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:27,480
" It was the most important role
of my life. Not because of my career... "

1131
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:29,649
" but because that was how
I met Ruth. "

1132
01:15:31,986 --> 01:15:33,570
" The first time we kissed... "

1133
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:38,533
" I knew I never wanted to kiss
any other lips but hers again. "

1134
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:47,792
" We moved to a small flat
in London together. "

1135
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,503
" She grew Scarlet Carsons for me
in our window box... "

1136
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:54,299
" and our place
always smelt of roses. "

1137
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:58,803
" Those were the best years of my life. "

1138
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:04,893
" But America's war grew worse
and worse... "

1139
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:06,895
" and eventually came to London. "

1140
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:10,190
" The bill proposed by the Undersecretary
for Defense, Adam Sutler... "

1141
01:16:10,358 --> 01:16:13,276
" to close the remaining tube stations
passed with.... "

1142
01:16:13,444 --> 01:16:16,321
" After that, there were no roses
anymore. "

1143
01:16:16,906 --> 01:16:18,198
" Not for anyone. "

1144
01:16:18,366 --> 01:16:20,450
You won't last much longer.

1145
01:16:20,618 --> 01:16:22,285
You're gonna die here.

1146
01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:25,538
Why protect someone
who doesn't give a shit about you?

1147
01:16:36,384 --> 01:16:39,761
" I remember how the meaning
of words began to change. "

1148
01:16:40,972 --> 01:16:46,476
" How unfamiliar words like "collateral"
and "rendition" became frightening... "

1149
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:49,374
" while things like "Norsefire"... "

1150
01:16:49,408 --> 01:16:51,931
" and the "Articles of Allegiance"
became powerful. "

1151
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:55,819
" I remember how "different"
became dangerous. "

1152
01:16:55,987 --> 01:16:58,488
" I still don't understand it... "

1153
01:16:58,656 --> 01:17:00,740
" why they hate us so much. "

1154
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:09,165
" They took Ruth
while she was out buying food. "

1155
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:14,504
" I've never cried so hard in my life. "

1156
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:18,258
" It wasn't long till they came for me. "

1157
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:30,103
" It seems strange that my life should end
in such a terrible place. "

1158
01:17:30,271 --> 01:17:35,692
" But for three years,
I had roses and apologized to no one. "

1159
01:17:38,529 --> 01:17:40,113
" I shall die here. "

1160
01:17:40,281 --> 01:17:43,825
" Every inch of me shall perish. "

1161
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:45,702
" Every inch... "

1162
01:17:46,287 --> 01:17:47,537
" but one. "

1163
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:53,418
" An inch. "

1164
01:17:54,128 --> 01:17:56,713
" It is small, and it is fragile... "

1165
01:17:56,922 --> 01:18:00,550
" and it is the only thing
in the world worth having. "

1166
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:05,847
" We must never lose it or give it away.
We must never let them take it from us. "

1167
01:18:06,599 --> 01:18:10,977
" I hope that, whoever you are,
you escape this place. "

1168
01:18:11,145 --> 01:18:14,356
" I hope that the world turns
and that things get better. "

1169
01:18:15,858 --> 01:18:19,444
" But what I hope most of all
is that you understand what I mean... "

1170
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:22,822
" when I tell you that
even though I do not know you... "

1171
01:18:22,990 --> 01:18:25,742
" and even though
I may never meet you... "

1172
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:29,162
" laugh with you, cry with you... "

1173
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:31,247
" or kiss you... "

1174
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:33,541
" I love you. "

1175
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:36,252
" With all my heart... "

1176
01:18:36,504 --> 01:18:38,463
" I love you. "

1177
01:18:40,091 --> 01:18:41,508
" Valerie. "

1178
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:55,772
I'm instructed to inform you...

1179
01:18:55,981 --> 01:18:58,942
that you have been convicted
by special tribunal...

1180
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:02,070
and that unless you are ready
to offer your cooperation...

1181
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:04,114
you are to be executed.

1182
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:08,034
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

1183
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:11,871
- Yes.
- Are you ready to cooperate?

1184
01:19:15,042 --> 01:19:18,002
- No.
- Very well.

1185
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:22,799
Escort Miss Hammond back to her cell.

1186
01:19:23,926 --> 01:19:25,427
Arrange a detail of six men...

1187
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:28,555
and take her out behind
the chemical shed and shoot her.

1188
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:45,822
It's time.

1189
01:19:47,533 --> 01:19:48,908
I'm ready.

1190
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:53,329
Look, all they want
is one little piece of information.

1191
01:19:53,539 --> 01:19:55,790
Just give them something, anything.

1192
01:19:56,709 --> 01:19:58,168
Thank you...

1193
01:19:58,335 --> 01:20:01,337
but I'd rather die
behind the chemical sheds.

1194
01:20:01,547 --> 01:20:05,800
Then you have no fear anymore.
You're completely free.

1195
01:20:11,891 --> 01:20:13,141
What?

1196
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:38,893
Hello, Evey.

1197
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:41,729
You.

1198
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:46,734
- It was you?
- Yeah.

1199
01:21:47,152 --> 01:21:48,820
That wasn't real?

1200
01:21:51,282 --> 01:21:55,285
- Is Gordon...?
- I'm sorry, but Mr. Deitrich's dead.

1201
01:21:55,452 --> 01:21:56,869
I thought they'd arrest him...

1202
01:21:57,037 --> 01:22:00,290
but when they found a Koran
in his house, they had him executed.

1203
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:02,458
Oh, God.

1204
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:05,627
Fortunately, I got to you before they did.

1205
01:22:05,661 --> 01:22:06,746
You got to me?

1206
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:10,300
You did this to me?

1207
01:22:11,885 --> 01:22:13,303
You cut my hair?

1208
01:22:14,972 --> 01:22:16,264
You tortured me?

1209
01:22:17,099 --> 01:22:18,933
You tortured me.

1210
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:21,686
Why?

1211
01:22:22,855 --> 01:22:27,317
You said you wanted to live without
fear. I wish there'd been an easier way...

1212
01:22:27,484 --> 01:22:29,527
- but there wasn't.
- Oh, my God.

1213
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:31,613
I know you may never forgive me...

1214
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:34,824
but nor will you understand
how hard it was for me.

1215
01:22:34,992 --> 01:22:38,077
Every day, I saw in myself
everything you see in me now.

1216
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:40,663
Every day, I wanted to end it.

1217
01:22:40,831 --> 01:22:44,417
But each time you refused to give in,
I knew I couldn't.

1218
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:47,337
You're sick! You're evil!

1219
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:50,965
You could have ended it.
You could have given in, but you didn't.

1220
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:54,093
- Why?
- Leave me alone! I hate you!

1221
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:57,847
That's it! See, at first,
I thought it was hate too.

1222
01:22:58,015 --> 01:23:00,558
Hate was all I knew.
It built my world, imprisoned me...

1223
01:23:00,726 --> 01:23:03,227
taught me how to eat,
how to drink, how to breathe.

1224
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:06,981
I thought I'd die
with all the hate in my veins.

1225
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:09,067
But then something happened.

1226
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:11,653
It happened to me
just as it happened to you.

1227
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:14,697
Shut up! I don't want to hear your lies!

1228
01:23:14,865 --> 01:23:18,618
Your own father said
that artists use lies to tell the truth.

1229
01:23:18,786 --> 01:23:20,536
Yes, I created a lie.

1230
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:24,332
But because you believed it,
you found something true about yourself.

1231
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,877
- No.
- What was true in that cell is true now.

1232
01:23:28,045 --> 01:23:31,130
What you felt in there
has nothing to do with me.

1233
01:23:31,298 --> 01:23:33,883
I can't feel anything anymore!

1234
01:23:34,051 --> 01:23:37,220
Don't run from it, Evey.
You've been running all your life.

1235
01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:40,765
I can't.... Can't breathe.

1236
01:23:41,308 --> 01:23:45,645
Asthma. When I was little...

1237
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:49,315
Listen to me, Evey.

1238
01:23:49,983 --> 01:23:53,069
This may be the most important moment
of your life. Commit to it.

1239
01:23:55,155 --> 01:23:58,700
They took your parents from you.
They took your brother from you.

1240
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:02,495
They put you in a cell
and took everything they could take...

1241
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:04,747
except your life.

1242
01:24:04,915 --> 01:24:07,792
And you believed that was all
there was, didn't you?

1243
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:10,712
The only thing you had left
was your life, but it wasn't.

1244
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:14,549
- Oh, please.
- You found something else.

1245
01:24:14,717 --> 01:24:18,553
In that cell, you found something
that mattered more to you than life.

1246
01:24:18,721 --> 01:24:22,056
When they threatened to kill you
unless you gave what they wanted...

1247
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:25,101
you told them you'd rather die.

1248
01:24:25,644 --> 01:24:27,186
You faced your death, Evey.

1249
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:30,314
You were calm. You were still.

1250
01:24:30,482 --> 01:24:32,900
Try to feel now what you felt then.

1251
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:41,033
Oh, God.

1252
01:24:43,537 --> 01:24:44,871
I felt....

1253
01:24:45,539 --> 01:24:46,956
Yes?

1254
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:50,752
I'm dizzy.

1255
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:53,004
I need air.

1256
01:24:53,172 --> 01:24:56,424
Please, I need to be outside.

1257
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:58,634
There's a lift. It'll take us to the roof.

1258
01:25:17,237 --> 01:25:18,696
God is in the rain.

1259
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:24,929
V.

1260
01:26:25,931 --> 01:26:27,431
I'm leaving.

1261
01:26:29,852 --> 01:26:33,437
There are 872 songs in here.

1262
01:26:34,314 --> 01:26:37,483
I've listened to them all,
but I've never danced to any of them.

1263
01:26:37,651 --> 01:26:40,778
- Did you hear me?
- Yes.

1264
01:26:40,946 --> 01:26:42,446
I can't stay here.

1265
01:26:43,949 --> 01:26:45,491
I know.

1266
01:26:46,743 --> 01:26:50,204
Well, you won't find
any more locked doors here.

1267
01:26:51,164 --> 01:26:53,332
I thought about keeping this...

1268
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:57,003
but it didn't seem right,
knowing you wrote it.

1269
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:04,468
I didn't.

1270
01:27:06,597 --> 01:27:08,681
May I show you something before you go?

1271
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:22,028
- She was real.
- Yes.

1272
01:27:22,195 --> 01:27:23,988
She's beautiful.

1273
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:27,241
- Did you know her?
- No.

1274
01:27:27,618 --> 01:27:30,077
She wrote the letter just before she died.

1275
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:33,122
And I delivered it to you
as it had been delivered to me.

1276
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:35,207
Then it really happened, didn't it?

1277
01:27:35,918 --> 01:27:38,502
- Yes.
- You were in the cell next to her.

1278
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:43,633
And that's what this is all about.

1279
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:46,928
You're getting back at them
for what they did to her.

1280
01:27:47,554 --> 01:27:50,806
- And to you.
- What was done to me created me.

1281
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:52,850
It's a basic principle of the universe...

1282
01:27:53,018 --> 01:27:55,978
that every action will create
an equal and opposing reaction.

1283
01:27:56,146 --> 01:27:57,521
Is that how you see it?

1284
01:27:57,689 --> 01:28:00,149
- Like an equation?
- What was done to me was monstrous.

1285
01:28:00,317 --> 01:28:02,401
And they created a monster.

1286
01:28:13,038 --> 01:28:16,082
- Do you know where you'll go?
- No.

1287
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:19,752
That would have scared me before...

1288
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:21,629
but I suppose I should thank you.

1289
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:23,631
Well....

1290
01:28:33,183 --> 01:28:34,850
Thank you.

1291
01:28:37,354 --> 01:28:38,980
Goodbye.

1292
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:42,858
Evey...

1293
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:46,821
may I ask you for something?

1294
01:28:46,989 --> 01:28:51,784
If I had one wish, I would wish
to see you again, if only once...

1295
01:28:51,994 --> 01:28:53,703
before the 5th.

1296
01:28:56,123 --> 01:28:58,582
- All right.
- Thank you.

1297
01:29:20,814 --> 01:29:23,566
Chancellor, I know no one
seems to want to discuss this...

1298
01:29:23,734 --> 01:29:26,152
but if we're to be prepared
for any eventuality...

1299
01:29:26,319 --> 01:29:29,238
then it can't be ignored any longer.

1300
01:29:29,406 --> 01:29:33,909
The red report in front of you has been
vetted by several demolition specialists.

1301
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:35,536
Now, it concludes that...

1302
01:29:35,704 --> 01:29:39,081
the most logical delivery system
for the terrorist to use...

1303
01:29:39,249 --> 01:29:41,667
would be an airborne attack.

1304
01:29:41,835 --> 01:29:43,461
A separate report has been filed...

1305
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:47,465
suggesting a train, despite the fact
that the tunnels surrounding Parliament...

1306
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:49,216
have been sealed shut.

1307
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:51,343
" Who filed that report? "

1308
01:29:52,512 --> 01:29:54,096
Chief Inspector Finch.

1309
01:29:54,264 --> 01:29:57,141
" Do you have any evidence
to support this conclusion, Mr. Finch? "

1310
01:29:57,350 --> 01:29:59,894
No, sir. Just a feeling.

1311
01:30:00,062 --> 01:30:02,021
" If I am sure of anything, inspector... "

1312
01:30:02,189 --> 01:30:04,250
" it is that this government
won't survive... "

1313
01:30:04,284 --> 01:30:06,391
" if it is to be subject
to your feelings. "

1314
01:30:06,526 --> 01:30:09,445
" Mr. Dascomb, what we need right now... "

1315
01:30:09,654 --> 01:30:12,698
" is a clear message
to the people of this country. "

1316
01:30:12,866 --> 01:30:15,201
" This message must be read
in every newspaper... "

1317
01:30:15,368 --> 01:30:17,912
" heard on every radio,
seen on every television. "

1318
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:22,124
" This message must resound
throughout the entire Interlink! "

1319
01:30:22,292 --> 01:30:25,669
" I want this country to realize
that we stand on the edge of oblivion. "

1320
01:30:25,837 --> 01:30:30,132
" I want every man, woman and child to
understand how close we are to chaos. "

1321
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:32,218
" I want everyone... "

1322
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:36,138
" to remember why they need us! "

1323
01:30:36,306 --> 01:30:40,810
" In the former United States, civil war
continues to devastate the Midwest. "

1324
01:30:40,977 --> 01:30:42,975
" Scientists attribute
this water shortage... "

1325
01:30:43,009 --> 01:30:45,347
" to the lack of rainfall
the last two years. "

1326
01:30:45,482 --> 01:30:48,609
" Ministry officials expect
water coupon prices to rise. "

1327
01:30:48,819 --> 01:30:50,736
" Police have arrested nine suspects.... "

1328
01:30:50,904 --> 01:30:54,657
- Can you believe this shit?
" - Been going on all summer. "

1329
01:30:54,825 --> 01:30:58,828
" Outside the quarantine zone, a new
airborne pathogen has killed 27 people. "

1330
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:01,331
" Authorities uncovered
new evidence linking... "

1331
01:31:01,365 --> 01:31:03,365
" the terrorist organization called V... "

1332
01:31:03,834 --> 01:31:07,795
" to the St. Mary's viral attack
on London 14 years ago. "

1333
01:31:19,808 --> 01:31:22,351
My friend inside the Finger
came up with something.

1334
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:24,395
There were three men.

1335
01:31:24,563 --> 01:31:26,355
Covert intel.

1336
01:31:26,523 --> 01:31:28,816
Original black-baggers, all under Creedy.

1337
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:33,696
Alan Percy, Robert Keyes,
William Rookwood.

1338
01:31:33,864 --> 01:31:35,948
The day after the St. Mary's outbreak...

1339
01:31:36,116 --> 01:31:39,535
Percy gives his Beretta a blowjob,
Keyes dies in a fire...

1340
01:31:39,744 --> 01:31:41,203
Rookwood goes missing.

1341
01:31:41,371 --> 01:31:44,290
Bloody coincidences
are making me sick to my stomach.

1342
01:31:44,457 --> 01:31:46,208
Rookwood.

1343
01:31:46,376 --> 01:31:48,252
How do I know that name?

1344
01:31:55,427 --> 01:31:58,429
Shit. He must have had
a hidden trip on his file at the Finger.

1345
01:31:58,638 --> 01:32:00,890
But how'd he know it was you?

1346
01:32:02,475 --> 01:32:04,018
What do we do?

1347
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:07,980
I'm a cop. I have to know.

1348
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:19,825
I came when they opened it.
It gave me the collywobbles.

1349
01:32:21,494 --> 01:32:23,120
Still does.

1350
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:35,382
That's close enough, inspector.

1351
01:32:36,927 --> 01:32:38,177
We're not wired.

1352
01:32:39,221 --> 01:32:42,723
I'm sorry, but a man in my position
survives by taking every precaution.

1353
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:46,143
- You have information for us?
- No, you already have the information.

1354
01:32:46,311 --> 01:32:48,395
All the names and dates
are inside your head.

1355
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:51,023
What you want,
what you really need, is a story.

1356
01:32:51,191 --> 01:32:53,192
A story can be true or false.

1357
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:56,904
I leave such judgments to you, inspector.

1358
01:32:57,739 --> 01:33:01,158
Our story begins,
as these stories often do...

1359
01:33:01,326 --> 01:33:04,453
with a young, up-and-coming politician.

1360
01:33:04,621 --> 01:33:08,624
He's a deeply religious man
and a member of the Conservative Party.

1361
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:13,128
" He's completely single-minded and
has no regard for the political process. "

1362
01:33:13,338 --> 01:33:16,465
" The more power he attains,
the more obvious his zealotry... "

1363
01:33:16,633 --> 01:33:19,260
" and the more aggressive
his supporters become. "

1364
01:33:20,136 --> 01:33:22,998
" Eventually, his party launches
a special project... "

1365
01:33:23,032 --> 01:33:25,299
" in the name of national security. "

1366
01:33:25,475 --> 01:33:28,811
" At first it's believed to be a search
for biological weapons... "

1367
01:33:28,979 --> 01:33:31,772
" and it's pursued without regard
to its cost. "

1368
01:33:31,940 --> 01:33:35,651
" However, the true goal
of this project is power. "

1369
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:38,612
" Complete and total
hegemonic domination. "

1370
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:41,365
" The project, however, ends violently. "

1371
01:33:42,742 --> 01:33:45,327
" But the efforts of those involved
are not in vain... "

1372
01:33:45,495 --> 01:33:50,499
" for a new ability to wage war is born
from the blood of one of the victims. "

1373
01:33:50,667 --> 01:33:54,295
Imagine a virus,
the most terrifying virus you can...

1374
01:33:54,462 --> 01:33:57,506
and then imagine that you
and you alone have the cure.

1375
01:33:57,674 --> 01:34:02,553
" But if your ultimate goal is power,
how best to use such a weapon? "

1376
01:34:02,762 --> 01:34:06,390
Well, it's at this point in our story
that along comes a spider.

1377
01:34:07,142 --> 01:34:09,018
" A man seemingly
without a conscience... "

1378
01:34:09,185 --> 01:34:11,478
for whom the ends
always justify the means. "

1379
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:15,232
" He suggests that their target
should not be an enemy of the country... "

1380
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:17,276
" but rather, the country itself. "

1381
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:20,696
" Three targets are chosen
to maximize the effect of the attack: "

1382
01:34:20,905 --> 01:34:23,866
" A school, a tube station
and a water-treatment plant. "

1383
01:34:24,034 --> 01:34:26,618
" Several hundred die
within the first few weeks. "

1384
01:34:26,786 --> 01:34:29,121
" Three Waters has, in fact,
been contaminated. "

1385
01:34:29,331 --> 01:34:31,957
" Authorities are attempting to control
its deadly spread. "

1386
01:34:32,125 --> 01:34:34,126
" Sent destruction through
the Underground. "

1387
01:34:35,545 --> 01:34:38,172
" Fueled by the media,
fear and panic spread quickly... "

1388
01:34:38,340 --> 01:34:41,425
" fracturing and dividing
the country until, at last... "

1389
01:34:41,593 --> 01:34:43,552
" the true goal comes into view. "

1390
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:45,346
Before the St. Mary's crises...

1391
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:46,979
no one would've predicted...

1392
01:34:47,013 --> 01:34:49,591
" the results of the election that year.
No one ".

1393
01:34:49,726 --> 01:34:54,188
" And then not long after the election,
lo and behold, a miracle. "

1394
01:34:54,356 --> 01:34:56,899
" Some believed it was the work
of God himself. "

1395
01:34:57,067 --> 01:35:00,819
" But it was a pharmaceutical company
controlled by certain party members... "

1396
01:35:00,987 --> 01:35:04,239
" that made them all obscenely rich. "

1397
01:35:04,449 --> 01:35:06,808
" A year later, several extremists
are tried, "

1398
01:35:06,842 --> 01:35:08,610
" found guilty and executed... "

1399
01:35:08,745 --> 01:35:12,039
while a memorial is built
to canonize their victims.

1400
01:35:13,083 --> 01:35:17,836
But the end result,
the true genius of the plan, was the fear.

1401
01:35:18,004 --> 01:35:20,339
Fear became the ultimate tool
of this government.

1402
01:35:20,507 --> 01:35:23,133
Through it, our politician
was ultimately appointed...

1403
01:35:23,301 --> 01:35:27,262
to the newly created position
of high chancellor.

1404
01:35:27,472 --> 01:35:30,057
The rest, as they say, is history.

1405
01:35:32,018 --> 01:35:36,105
- Can you prove any of this?
- Why do you think I'm still alive?

1406
01:35:38,691 --> 01:35:42,611
All right. We'd like to take you into
protective custody, Mr. Rookwood.

1407
01:35:42,779 --> 01:35:44,655
I'm sure you would.

1408
01:35:44,823 --> 01:35:49,743
But if you want that recording,
you'll do what I tell you to do.

1409
01:35:49,911 --> 01:35:52,871
Put Creedy under 24-hour surveillance.

1410
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:55,916
When I feel safe he can't pick his nose
without you knowing...

1411
01:35:56,084 --> 01:35:57,543
I'll contact you again.

1412
01:35:57,710 --> 01:36:00,003
Till then, cheerio.

1413
01:36:01,631 --> 01:36:03,006
Rookwood...

1414
01:36:04,634 --> 01:36:06,510
why didn't you come forward before?

1415
01:36:07,554 --> 01:36:08,929
What were you waiting for?

1416
01:36:09,097 --> 01:36:11,306
Well, for you, inspector.

1417
01:36:11,516 --> 01:36:13,267
I needed you.

1418
01:36:34,205 --> 01:36:36,331
Shh, shh, shh....

1419
01:36:40,545 --> 01:36:42,629
What's he doing in the dark there?

1420
01:36:42,797 --> 01:36:45,340
Creepy Creedy. Not sure I wanna know.

1421
01:36:45,550 --> 01:36:49,094
Sutler can no longer trust you,
can he, Mr. Creedy?

1422
01:36:49,262 --> 01:36:51,430
And we both know why.

1423
01:36:52,098 --> 01:36:54,475
After I destroy Parliament...

1424
01:36:54,642 --> 01:36:58,520
his only chance will be to offer them
someone else, some other piece of meat.

1425
01:36:58,688 --> 01:36:59,938
And who will that be?

1426
01:37:00,190 --> 01:37:02,357
You, Mr. Creedy.

1427
01:37:02,567 --> 01:37:06,028
A man as smart as you
has probably considered this.

1428
01:37:06,196 --> 01:37:09,990
A man as smart as you probably has a plan.

1429
01:37:10,158 --> 01:37:13,327
That plan is the reason
Sutler no longer trusts you.

1430
01:37:13,495 --> 01:37:15,996
It's the reason why
you're being watched right now...

1431
01:37:16,164 --> 01:37:18,957
why there are eyes and ears
in every room of this house...

1432
01:37:19,125 --> 01:37:21,710
- and a tap on every phone.
- Bollocks.

1433
01:37:21,878 --> 01:37:26,298
Oh, a man as smart as you, I think,
knows otherwise.

1434
01:37:26,466 --> 01:37:29,468
- What do you want?
- Sutler.

1435
01:37:31,095 --> 01:37:33,639
Come, now, Mr. Creedy,
you knew this was coming.

1436
01:37:33,806 --> 01:37:35,807
You knew that one day it'd be you or him.

1437
01:37:35,975 --> 01:37:39,311
That's why Sutler's been kept
underground for security purposes.

1438
01:37:39,479 --> 01:37:42,648
That's why there are several
of your men close to Sutler...

1439
01:37:42,815 --> 01:37:46,610
men that can be counted on.
All you have to do is say the word.

1440
01:37:46,778 --> 01:37:49,696
- What do I get out of this deal?
- Me.

1441
01:37:51,533 --> 01:37:54,701
If you accept,
put an X on your front door.

1442
01:37:56,829 --> 01:37:58,747
Why should I trust you?

1443
01:37:58,915 --> 01:38:02,125
Because it's the only way
you're ever going to stop me.

1444
01:38:10,009 --> 01:38:13,554
" It is not my sword, Mondego,
but your past that disarmed you. "

1445
01:38:15,348 --> 01:38:16,765
" May we come up? "

1446
01:38:18,142 --> 01:38:20,352
" You find your own tree. "

1447
01:38:31,447 --> 01:38:34,283
We got Creepy pinned
like a butterfly for weeks.

1448
01:38:34,951 --> 01:38:37,286
Still no word. What's he waiting for?

1449
01:38:40,456 --> 01:38:42,916
Yeah? Inspector, it's for you.

1450
01:38:45,587 --> 01:38:47,546
- Yeah.
" - Is that Chief Inspector Finch? "

1451
01:38:47,714 --> 01:38:49,506
- It is.
" - This is Captain Clark... "

1452
01:38:49,674 --> 01:38:51,800
" of the 137th Ward at Southend. "

1453
01:38:51,968 --> 01:38:53,176
" - We found him. "
- Found who?

1454
01:38:53,344 --> 01:38:55,429
" William Rookwood,
the one you're looking for. "

1455
01:38:55,597 --> 01:38:57,351
" I saw your report a couple weeks back, "

1456
01:38:57,385 --> 01:38:59,424
" thought I'd run it
through our John Does. "

1457
01:38:59,559 --> 01:39:01,476
" I hooked him. Perfect dental match. "

1458
01:39:01,686 --> 01:39:05,564
" A floater. Fishermen picked him up.
No ID, never solved. Till now, that is. "

1459
01:39:05,732 --> 01:39:09,484
- William Rookwood is dead?
" - I'd say so. Twenty years now. "

1460
01:39:13,031 --> 01:39:14,239
Goddamn it!

1461
01:39:14,616 --> 01:39:16,908
That son of a bitch sat there...

1462
01:39:17,076 --> 01:39:20,787
and spoon-fed me that bullshit,
and I ate it up!

1463
01:39:21,706 --> 01:39:23,624
So, what do we do now, inspector?

1464
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:26,209
We do what we should have been doing.

1465
01:39:26,919 --> 01:39:28,211
We find him.

1466
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:52,861
" Every day, gentlemen. "

1467
01:39:53,029 --> 01:39:57,074
" Every day that brings us closer
to November... "

1468
01:39:57,241 --> 01:39:59,993
" every day that man remains free... "

1469
01:40:00,370 --> 01:40:02,871
" is one more failure. "

1470
01:40:03,039 --> 01:40:05,457
" Three hundred and forty-seven days,
gentlemen. "

1471
01:40:05,625 --> 01:40:08,043
" Three hundred and forty-seven
failures! "

1472
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:10,879
Chancellor, we do not have
the adequate force...

1473
01:40:11,047 --> 01:40:14,049
" We are being buried
beneath the avalanche... "

1474
01:40:14,258 --> 01:40:17,177
" of your inadequacies, Mr. Creedy! "

1475
01:40:34,612 --> 01:40:35,779
I'll get it.

1476
01:40:37,115 --> 01:40:39,408
- Eric Finch?
- Yeah.

1477
01:40:44,288 --> 01:40:45,539
Bloody hell.

1478
01:40:47,083 --> 01:40:48,208
How many went out?

1479
01:40:49,585 --> 01:40:50,794
So far we count eight boxcars.

1480
01:40:50,962 --> 01:40:53,797
- Several hundred thousand, at least.
- Christ.

1481
01:40:55,341 --> 01:40:59,428
" I want anyone caught
with one of those masks arrested! "

1482
01:40:59,595 --> 01:41:02,389
Give me the money!
Give me the fucking money!

1483
01:41:02,557 --> 01:41:05,559
We're under siege here.
The whole city's gone mad.

1484
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:08,687
- This is exactly what he wants.
- What?

1485
01:41:08,855 --> 01:41:12,566
- Anarchy in the UK!
- Chaos.

1486
01:41:12,734 --> 01:41:17,946
" Mr. Creedy, I am holding you personally
responsible for this situation. "

1487
01:41:20,408 --> 01:41:24,828
The problem is that he knows us
better than we know ourselves.

1488
01:41:26,539 --> 01:41:29,708
That's why I went to Larkhill last night.

1489
01:41:29,876 --> 01:41:33,336
- That's outside quarantine.
- I had to see it.

1490
01:41:34,964 --> 01:41:36,631
There wasn't much left.

1491
01:41:37,592 --> 01:41:40,761
But when I was there, it was strange.

1492
01:41:40,928 --> 01:41:44,598
I suddenly had this feeling
that everything was connected.

1493
01:41:50,271 --> 01:41:51,897
Like I could see the whole thing.

1494
01:41:52,231 --> 01:41:57,110
One long chain of events that stretched
all the way back before Larkhill.

1495
01:41:59,155 --> 01:42:02,491
I felt like I could see everything
that had happened...

1496
01:42:08,623 --> 01:42:10,582
and everything that
was going to happen.

1497
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:12,793
Hey, you!

1498
01:42:14,879 --> 01:42:19,132
It was like a perfect pattern
laid out in front of me...

1499
01:42:20,468 --> 01:42:22,969
and I realized that
we were all a part of it...

1500
01:42:27,558 --> 01:42:29,392
and all trapped by it.

1501
01:42:36,734 --> 01:42:38,610
So do you know what's gonna happen?

1502
01:42:39,403 --> 01:42:42,489
No. It was a feeling.

1503
01:42:44,492 --> 01:42:46,117
But I can guess.

1504
01:42:48,079 --> 01:42:51,623
With so much chaos,
someone will do something stupid.

1505
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:57,504
And when they do...

1506
01:42:57,672 --> 01:42:59,631
things will turn nasty.

1507
01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:15,939
" Rioters were arrested in Brixton. "

1508
01:43:16,148 --> 01:43:20,569
And then Sutler will be forced to do
the only thing he knows how to do.

1509
01:43:23,739 --> 01:43:29,077
At which point,
all V needs to do is keep his word.

1510
01:43:30,371 --> 01:43:31,705
And then....

1511
01:44:35,937 --> 01:44:38,563
Tonight's your big night.

1512
01:44:39,565 --> 01:44:41,274
You ready for it?

1513
01:44:43,527 --> 01:44:45,654
Are we ready for it?

1514
01:45:18,896 --> 01:45:20,563
I missed this song.

1515
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:23,566
I didn't think you'd come.

1516
01:45:24,568 --> 01:45:27,404
- I said I would.
- Ah.

1517
01:45:29,949 --> 01:45:31,533
You look well.

1518
01:45:31,701 --> 01:45:33,159
Thank you.

1519
01:45:34,787 --> 01:45:39,332
May I inquire as to how
you've avoided detection?

1520
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:42,460
A fake ID works better
than a Guy Fawkes mask.

1521
01:45:44,088 --> 01:45:48,008
I must confess, every time
I heard a siren, I worried about you.

1522
01:45:48,175 --> 01:45:51,511
I worried about myself for a while.

1523
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:54,431
But then, one day, I was at a market...

1524
01:45:54,598 --> 01:45:58,685
and a friend, someone I had worked
with at the BTN, got in line behind me.

1525
01:45:59,854 --> 01:46:04,024
I was so nervous that when the cashier
asked me for my money, I dropped it.

1526
01:46:05,276 --> 01:46:07,652
My friend picked it up...

1527
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:09,904
and handed it to me.

1528
01:46:10,614 --> 01:46:12,949
She looked at me right in the eyes...

1529
01:46:13,951 --> 01:46:15,827
didn't recognize me.

1530
01:46:18,164 --> 01:46:21,249
Whatever you did to me worked better
than I'd have imagined.

1531
01:46:27,214 --> 01:46:29,758
I have a gift for you, Evey...

1532
01:46:29,925 --> 01:46:34,929
but before I give it to you,
I'd like to ask you something.

1533
01:46:35,139 --> 01:46:38,058
Would you dance with me?

1534
01:46:39,143 --> 01:46:42,604
Now? On the eve of your revolution?

1535
01:46:42,772 --> 01:46:46,274
A revolution without dancing
is a revolution not worth having.

1536
01:46:47,860 --> 01:46:49,152
I'd love to.

1537
01:46:50,571 --> 01:46:53,698
" Tonight, I will speak directly
to these people... "

1538
01:46:53,866 --> 01:46:56,284
" and make the situation
perfectly clear to them. "

1539
01:46:56,452 --> 01:47:02,040
" The security of this nation depends
on complete and total compliance. "

1540
01:47:02,208 --> 01:47:06,753
" Tonight, any protestor,
any instigator or agitator... "

1541
01:47:06,921 --> 01:47:09,130
" will be made example of! "

1542
01:47:11,926 --> 01:47:14,886
Chancellor, there is a contingency
that has not been addressed.

1543
01:47:15,054 --> 01:47:16,888
" And what is that, Mr. Dascomb? "

1544
01:47:17,056 --> 01:47:19,265
- Should the terrorist succeed...
" - He won't. "

1545
01:47:19,433 --> 01:47:22,977
I understand that it is highly unlikely,
but if he does...

1546
01:47:23,187 --> 01:47:26,898
" If he does, and something happens
to that building... "

1547
01:47:27,066 --> 01:47:30,318
" the only thing that will change,
the only difference it will make... "

1548
01:47:30,486 --> 01:47:33,238
" is that tomorrow morning,
instead of a newspaper... "

1549
01:47:33,405 --> 01:47:37,283
" I will be reading
Mr. Creedy's resignation! "

1550
01:47:42,123 --> 01:47:46,251
You've been busy.
They're very scared right now.

1551
01:47:46,418 --> 01:47:50,505
I heard Sutler's going to make
a public statement tonight.

1552
01:47:50,714 --> 01:47:52,340
It's nearly time.

1553
01:47:52,508 --> 01:47:55,176
The masks were ingenious.

1554
01:47:55,344 --> 01:47:58,179
It was strange to suddenly see
your face everywhere.

1555
01:47:58,347 --> 01:48:01,474
" Conceal me what I am, and be my aid... "

1556
01:48:01,642 --> 01:48:05,019
" for such disguise as haply
shall become the form of my intent. "

1557
01:48:05,229 --> 01:48:08,022
- Twelfth Night.
- Viola.

1558
01:48:08,232 --> 01:48:10,942
- I don't understand.
- What?k

1559
01:48:11,110 --> 01:48:14,529
How you can be one of the most
important things that's happened to me...

1560
01:48:14,738 --> 01:48:17,115
and yet I know
almost nothing about you.

1561
01:48:17,283 --> 01:48:20,076
I don't know where you were born,
who your parents were...

1562
01:48:20,244 --> 01:48:22,704
if you had any brothers or sisters.

1563
01:48:22,872 --> 01:48:25,999
I don't even know
what you really look like.

1564
01:48:26,167 --> 01:48:28,251
Evey, please.

1565
01:48:29,420 --> 01:48:31,629
There is a face beneath this mask...

1566
01:48:31,797 --> 01:48:33,631
but it's not me.

1567
01:48:33,799 --> 01:48:37,177
I'm no more that face than I am
the muscles beneath it...

1568
01:48:37,344 --> 01:48:39,012
or the bones beneath them.

1569
01:48:41,265 --> 01:48:42,473
I understand.

1570
01:48:43,684 --> 01:48:45,268
Thank you.

1571
01:48:46,020 --> 01:48:47,770
There isn't much time.

1572
01:48:47,938 --> 01:48:50,106
I have something I must give you.

1573
01:48:50,482 --> 01:48:52,483
I went by Parliament.

1574
01:48:52,651 --> 01:48:57,488
Never seen anything like it.
Tanks, anti-aircraft, infantry.

1575
01:48:58,365 --> 01:49:01,284
Makes you wish that no one
would show up tonight.

1576
01:49:03,287 --> 01:49:05,914
But if they do,
what do you think will happen?

1577
01:49:06,665 --> 01:49:09,250
What usually happens
when people without guns...

1578
01:49:09,418 --> 01:49:12,086
stand up to people with guns.

1579
01:49:13,380 --> 01:49:14,422
Pull over here.

1580
01:49:14,590 --> 01:49:18,092
We've searched these tunnels for weeks.
You think you're gonna find him now?

1581
01:49:21,472 --> 01:49:22,889
Inspector.

1582
01:49:23,682 --> 01:49:25,558
It's all gone wrong, hasn't it?

1583
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:38,154
The Underground?
I thought they closed this all down.

1584
01:49:38,322 --> 01:49:39,572
They did.

1585
01:49:39,740 --> 01:49:43,534
It took nearly 10 years to
clear the tracks and lay a bit of my own.

1586
01:49:45,496 --> 01:49:47,038
Let me show you.

1587
01:50:03,180 --> 01:50:05,056
These tracks lead to Parliament.

1588
01:50:05,349 --> 01:50:06,766
Yes.

1589
01:50:07,476 --> 01:50:09,477
Then it's really going to happen,
isn't it?

1590
01:50:09,645 --> 01:50:12,939
It will if you want it to.

1591
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:15,566
- What?
- This is my gift to you, Evey.

1592
01:50:16,151 --> 01:50:21,614
Everything that I have: my home,
my books, the gallery, this train...

1593
01:50:21,782 --> 01:50:24,742
I'm leaving to you to do with
what you will.

1594
01:50:24,910 --> 01:50:26,327
Is this another trick, V?

1595
01:50:26,495 --> 01:50:30,832
No. No more tricks. No more lies.

1596
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:32,917
Only truth.

1597
01:50:33,085 --> 01:50:36,254
And the truth is, you made me
understand that I was wrong...

1598
01:50:36,755 --> 01:50:41,676
that the choice to pull this lever
is not mine to make.

1599
01:50:41,885 --> 01:50:44,637
- Why?
- Because this world...

1600
01:50:44,805 --> 01:50:49,267
the world that I'm a part of and
that I helped shape, will end tonight.

1601
01:50:50,311 --> 01:50:52,353
And tomorrow,
a different world will begin...

1602
01:50:52,521 --> 01:50:57,608
that different people will shape,
and this choice belongs to them.

1603
01:51:00,612 --> 01:51:02,530
Where are you going?

1604
01:51:02,781 --> 01:51:05,116
The time has come for me
to meet my maker...

1605
01:51:05,284 --> 01:51:08,619
and to repay him in kind
for all that he's done.

1606
01:51:08,787 --> 01:51:11,539
V, wait!
Please, you don't have to do this.

1607
01:51:11,707 --> 01:51:14,292
You could let it go.
We could leave here together.

1608
01:51:14,460 --> 01:51:17,420
No. You were right about what I am.

1609
01:51:17,921 --> 01:51:19,922
I have no tree waiting for me.

1610
01:51:20,341 --> 01:51:24,844
All I want, all I deserve,
is at the end of that tunnel.

1611
01:51:25,012 --> 01:51:26,763
That's not true.

1612
01:51:53,374 --> 01:51:54,749
I can't.

1613
01:52:03,842 --> 01:52:05,468
" My fellow Englishmen... "

1614
01:52:06,011 --> 01:52:08,012
" tonight, our country... "

1615
01:52:08,180 --> 01:52:09,722
" that which we stand for... "

1616
01:52:09,973 --> 01:52:11,516
" and all that we hold dear... "

1617
01:52:11,683 --> 01:52:15,436
" faces a grave and terrible threat. "

1618
01:52:15,604 --> 01:52:17,105
The area's clean, sir.

1619
01:52:17,689 --> 01:52:21,442
" This violent and unparalleled assault
to our security... "

1620
01:52:21,610 --> 01:52:23,403
" will not go undefended. "

1621
01:52:23,570 --> 01:52:24,821
Where is he?

1622
01:52:24,988 --> 01:52:26,030
" Or unpunished. "

1623
01:52:26,198 --> 01:52:28,366
Penny for the Guy.

1624
01:52:28,534 --> 01:52:32,537
" Our enemy is an insidious one,
seeking to divide us... "

1625
01:52:33,122 --> 01:52:37,583
" and destroy the very foundation
of our great nation. "

1626
01:52:37,751 --> 01:52:41,796
I have kept my side of the bargain,
but have you kept yours?

1627
01:52:42,005 --> 01:52:43,131
Bring him down.

1628
01:52:43,298 --> 01:52:45,550
" Tonight we must remain steadfast. "

1629
01:52:46,051 --> 01:52:47,885
" We must remain determined. "

1630
01:52:48,053 --> 01:52:51,264
" But most of all,
we must remain united. "

1631
01:52:54,518 --> 01:52:58,146
" Those caught tonight
in violation of curfew... "

1632
01:52:58,313 --> 01:53:00,982
" will be considered in league
with our enemy... "

1633
01:53:01,150 --> 01:53:04,402
" and prosecuted as a terrorist
without leniency or exception. "

1634
01:53:04,570 --> 01:53:06,070
I want to see his face.

1635
01:53:06,238 --> 01:53:09,699
" Tonight I give you
my most solemn vow... "

1636
01:53:09,867 --> 01:53:12,285
" that justice will be swift... "

1637
01:53:12,453 --> 01:53:14,912
" it will be righteous... "

1638
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:17,331
" and it will be without mercy. "

1639
01:53:19,543 --> 01:53:21,669
Oh, God. No.

1640
01:53:21,837 --> 01:53:25,756
At last, we finally meet.

1641
01:53:28,302 --> 01:53:30,678
I have something for you, chancellor.

1642
01:53:30,929 --> 01:53:32,722
A farewell gift.

1643
01:53:32,890 --> 01:53:36,517
For all the things you've done,
for the things you might have done...

1644
01:53:36,685 --> 01:53:38,686
and for the only thing you have left.

1645
01:53:41,064 --> 01:53:42,982
Goodbye, chancellor.

1646
01:53:43,984 --> 01:53:45,193
Mr. Creedy.

1647
01:53:47,571 --> 01:53:49,322
Disgusting.

1648
01:54:02,085 --> 01:54:04,212
Now that's done with...

1649
01:54:04,379 --> 01:54:08,216
it's time to have a look at your face.

1650
01:54:08,759 --> 01:54:10,301
Take off your mask.

1651
01:54:10,594 --> 01:54:11,844
No.

1652
01:54:27,236 --> 01:54:28,903
Defiant to the end, huh?

1653
01:54:30,864 --> 01:54:34,450
You won't cry like him, will you?
You're not afraid of death.

1654
01:54:34,618 --> 01:54:35,785
You're like me.

1655
01:54:35,953 --> 01:54:38,579
The only thing you and I
have in common, Mr. Creedy...

1656
01:54:38,747 --> 01:54:40,373
is we're both about to die.

1657
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,751
How do you imagine that's gonna happen?

1658
01:54:44,044 --> 01:54:46,254
With my hands around your neck.

1659
01:54:48,507 --> 01:54:49,632
Bollocks.

1660
01:54:50,759 --> 01:54:52,969
What are you gonna do, huh?

1661
01:54:53,136 --> 01:54:55,263
We've swept this place.
You've got nothing.

1662
01:54:55,430 --> 01:54:59,809
Nothing but your bloody knives
and your fancy karate gimmicks.

1663
01:54:59,977 --> 01:55:01,561
We have guns.

1664
01:55:01,728 --> 01:55:04,981
No, you have bullets and the hope
that when your guns are empty...

1665
01:55:05,148 --> 01:55:07,275
I'm no longer standing,
because if I am...

1666
01:55:08,151 --> 01:55:10,236
you'll all be dead
before you've reloaded.

1667
01:55:10,571 --> 01:55:12,738
That's impossible!

1668
01:55:15,158 --> 01:55:16,200
Kill him.

1669
01:55:40,851 --> 01:55:41,976
My turn.

1670
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:55,841
Die! Die!

1671
01:56:56,760 --> 01:56:58,886
Why won't you die?!

1672
01:56:59,846 --> 01:57:01,263
Why won't you die?

1673
01:57:03,058 --> 01:57:06,185
Beneath this mask
there is more than flesh.

1674
01:57:06,353 --> 01:57:09,146
Beneath this mask there is an idea,
Mr. Creedy.

1675
01:57:10,524 --> 01:57:12,775
And ideas are bulletproof.

1676
01:58:04,453 --> 01:58:07,538
This is perimeter one.
Whitehall is secure. Over.

1677
01:58:07,706 --> 01:58:08,956
This is General Ackroyd.

1678
01:58:09,416 --> 01:58:10,958
Keep communication tight.

1679
01:58:11,126 --> 01:58:14,378
I won't have this getting any more
bollixed up than it already is.

1680
01:58:18,341 --> 01:58:19,633
V!

1681
01:58:24,264 --> 01:58:26,807
Oh, God, we have to stop your bleeding.

1682
01:58:26,975 --> 01:58:31,103
Please, don't.
I'm finished and glad of it.

1683
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:33,105
Don't say that.

1684
01:58:33,607 --> 01:58:36,484
I told you, only truth.

1685
01:58:39,988 --> 01:58:43,449
For 20 years I sought only this day.

1686
01:58:43,617 --> 01:58:45,743
Nothing else existed...

1687
01:58:47,871 --> 01:58:49,872
until I saw you.

1688
01:58:50,999 --> 01:58:53,250
Then everything changed.

1689
01:58:54,669 --> 01:58:56,587
I fell in love with you, Evey...

1690
01:58:58,173 --> 01:59:01,342
like I no longer believed I could.

1691
01:59:01,510 --> 01:59:04,011
V, I don't want you to die.

1692
01:59:06,765 --> 01:59:10,518
That's the most beautiful thing...

1693
01:59:10,685 --> 01:59:13,312
you could have ever given me.

1694
01:59:20,904 --> 01:59:22,321
V?

1695
01:59:23,532 --> 01:59:24,824
V?!

1696
01:59:35,460 --> 01:59:38,212
Eyes and ears have detected movement
heading to Trafalgar Square.

1697
01:59:38,421 --> 01:59:40,422
This is perimeter one.
We have enemy contact.

1698
02:00:12,664 --> 02:00:14,748
Hold it. Stop right there.

1699
02:00:18,169 --> 02:00:19,670
You're Evey Hammond, aren't you?

1700
02:00:27,679 --> 02:00:28,971
Then it's over?

1701
02:00:29,472 --> 02:00:30,639
Almost.

1702
02:00:30,807 --> 02:00:33,267
Stop. Get your hand off that lever.

1703
02:00:35,604 --> 02:00:36,687
No.

1704
02:00:37,480 --> 02:00:39,857
Enemy is approaching fast.
Requesting orders.

1705
02:00:40,025 --> 02:00:42,276
- What shall we do?
- No response from Command.

1706
02:00:43,695 --> 02:00:46,030
Or from Party Leader Creedy.

1707
02:00:46,197 --> 02:00:47,489
Or from the high chancellor.

1708
02:00:48,408 --> 02:00:49,617
Why are you doing this?

1709
02:00:50,160 --> 02:00:52,536
- Because he was right.
- About what?

1710
02:00:52,704 --> 02:00:57,207
That this country needs more than
a building right now. It needs hope.

1711
02:01:02,255 --> 02:01:04,757
Bloody hell, stand down! Stand down!

1712
02:01:31,534 --> 02:01:33,953
Jesus bloody Christ.

1713
02:01:59,229 --> 02:02:00,354
It's time.

1714
02:02:21,710 --> 02:02:23,085
Tell me...

1715
02:02:24,087 --> 02:02:26,588
do you like music, Mr. Finch?

1716
02:02:46,151 --> 02:02:48,152
That music?

1717
02:02:48,653 --> 02:02:50,112
Yes.

1718
02:02:50,530 --> 02:02:52,114
His music.

1719
02:03:24,022 --> 02:03:25,647
Who was he?

1720
02:03:26,858 --> 02:03:28,150
He was Edmond Dantes.

1721
02:03:30,278 --> 02:03:32,654
And he was my father...

1722
02:03:32,822 --> 02:03:34,782
and my mother.

1723
02:03:35,658 --> 02:03:37,159
My brother.

1724
02:03:39,162 --> 02:03:40,954
My friend.

1725
02:03:41,915 --> 02:03:43,916
He was you...

1726
02:03:45,960 --> 02:03:47,461
and me.

1727
02:03:49,547 --> 02:03:51,423
He was all of us.

1728
02:04:20,912 --> 02:04:23,330
" No one will ever forget that night... "

1729
02:04:23,498 --> 02:04:26,208
" and what it meant for this country. "

1730
02:04:26,709 --> 02:04:29,086
" But I will never forget the man... "

1731
02:04:29,254 --> 02:04:30,921
" and what he meant to me. "
