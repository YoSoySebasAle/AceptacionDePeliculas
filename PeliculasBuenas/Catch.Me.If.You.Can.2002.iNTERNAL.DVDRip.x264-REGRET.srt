1
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:01,199
Thank you very much
and welcome to To Tell the Truth.

2
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,519
Our first guest, he's made a career out
of being the most outrageous impostor

3
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,599
that we've ever come across
on this show. You'll see what I mean.

4
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,079
Number One,
what is your name, please?

5
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,079
My name is Frank William Abagnale.

6
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,439
- Number Two?
- My name is Frank William Abagnale.

7
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,799
- Number Three?
- My name is Frank William Abagnale.

8
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,599
From 1964 to 1967,

9
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,599
I successfully impersonated
an airline pilot for Pan Am Airways,

10
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,399
and I flew over two million miles
for free.

11
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:31,600
During that time,

12
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,440
I was also the Chief Resident
Pediatrician at a Georgia hospital

13
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,799
and an Assistant Attorney General
for the State of Louisiana.

14
00:03:38,881 --> 00:03:40,400
By the time I was caught,

15
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,719
I was considered the youngest and most
daring con man in U.S. history.

16
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,839
I had cashed almost $4 million
in fraudulent checks

17
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,039
in 26 foreign countries and all 50 states.

18
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,240
And I did it all before my 19th birthday.

19
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,439
My name is Frank William Abagnale.

20
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,400
So, for the first time,
he'll have to tell the truth.

21
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,479
We'll start our questioning with Kitty.

22
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,200
Thank you. Number One,
why, with all your talent,

23
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,279
and you're obviously
a very bright fellow,

24
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,519
why didn't you go in for
a legitimate profession?

25
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,720
It was a question of dollars and cents.

26
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,599
When I was a young man,
I needed the money,

27
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,279
and I thought this list of careers was
the easiest way to get it.

28
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,039
I see. Number Two,
I find this all very fascinating.

29
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,639
Who was it that finally caught you?

30
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,079
His name was Carl Hanratty.

31
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,919
Hanratty.

32
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,760
I am...

33
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,719
Carl Hanratty.

34
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,239
I represent the F.B.I.
from the United States of America.

35
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,799
I have orders to see
the American prisoner, Abagnale.

36
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,919
You sit here.

37
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,079
You do not open the door.

38
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,959
You do not pass him

39
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,159
anything through the hole.

40
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,879
Aw, Jesus.

41
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,440
You know,
I've got a little bit of a cold myself.

42
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,319
Frank, I'm here to read
the articles of extradition

43
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:10,079
according to the European Court
for Human Rights.

44
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,439
Article One,

45
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:14,680
extradition shall be granted
in respect of offenses...

46
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,999
Help me.

47
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,559
Frank, stop it.

48
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,360
Help me.

49
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,839
You don't think
you're actually going to fool me, do you?

50
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,560
Sixteen pages to go.
Stay with me. Article Two,

51
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,679
if the request for extradition
includes separate offenses...

52
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,759
each of which is punishable under
the laws of the requesting party...

53
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,175
Frank?

54
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,279
God damn it!

55
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,479
Get me a doctor in here!
I need a doctor!

56
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,479
- Yes.
- Doctor! Now!

57
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,040
Don't sweat it.
We'll get you right to a doctor.

58
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,720
If you can hear me, don't worry.
I'll take you home in the morning.

59
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,879
Home in the morning, Frank.

60
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,879
- What are you doing?
- Washing off the lice.

61
00:07:12,961 --> 00:07:16,079
This man has to be on a plane
for America. He has to see a doctor.

62
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
Yes, the doctor comes in tomorrow.

63
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,439
I've worked too long, too hard,
for you to take this away from me.

64
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,239
If he dies, I'm holding you responsible.

65
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,679
Oh, Frank.

66
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,919
Okay, Carl,

67
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,759
let's go home.

68
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,719
The New Rochelle Rotary Club

69
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,599
has a history that goes back to 1919.

70
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,999
In all those years,

71
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,359
we've only seen a handful
of deserving gentlemen

72
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,639
inducted as lifetime members.

73
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,399
It's an honor that has seen 57 names

74
00:08:40,601 --> 00:08:42,559
enshrined on the wall of honor.

75
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,759
And tonight, we make it 58.

76
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,199
So please stand

77
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,639
as I present my very good friend,
a man who keeps our pencils sharp

78
00:08:52,121 --> 00:08:53,879
and our pens in ink.

79
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,479
Frank William Abagnale.

80
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,039
I stand here, humbled

81
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:20,559
by the presence of
Mayor Robert Wagner

82
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,640
and our club president, Jack Barnes.

83
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,759
Most of all, I'm honored to see
my loving wife, Paula

84
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,279
and my son, Frank Jr.

85
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,720
Come on.

86
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,479
Sitting in the front row.

87
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,399
Two little mice fell in a bucket of cream.

88
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,839
The first mouse quickly gave up
and drowned.

89
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,439
The second mouse

90
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,280
wouldn't quit.

91
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,559
He struggled so hard

92
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,719
that eventually he churned that cream
into butter

93
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,479
and crawled out.

94
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,559
Gentlemen, as of this moment,
I am that second mouse.

95
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,840
You're a better dancer
than your father.

96
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,679
- Hear that, Daddy?
- Like fun.

97
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,159
The girls don't know
what they're in for.

98
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,359
Show him the dance you were doing
when we met.

99
00:10:44,441 --> 00:10:46,080
Oh, who can remember?

100
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,480
The people in that little French village
were so happy to see Americans,

101
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,039
they decided to put on a show for us.

102
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,719
- So they crammed 200 soldiers...
- We know the story, Daddy.

103
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,799
into that tiny social hall,

104
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,840
and the first person to walk on stage
is your mother

105
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,839
and she starts to dance.

106
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,399
You know, it had been months

107
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,999
since we'd seen a woman,
and here's this blond angel.

108
00:11:10,081 --> 00:11:11,759
Blond bombshell.

109
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,479
And the men
are literally holding their breath.

110
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,479
Holding their breath for you. Hear that?

111
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,879
I turned to my buddies and I said...

112
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,440
I will not leave France without her.

113
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,960
And I didn't.

114
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,439
You didn't.

115
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,399
I didn't.

116
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,079
Oh, shit, the rug.

117
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,199
- Oh, Mom.
- I can't believe I...

118
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:36,239
It's nothing.

119
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,480
- Frankie, run and get a towel.
- Yeah.

120
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,799
Come on.

121
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,239
Dance with me, Paula.

122
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,479
Whenever I dance for you,
I get in trouble.

123
00:12:12,761 --> 00:12:15,119
Frank. Wake up. Come on, let's go.

124
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,799
Get up, come on.

125
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,600
- Frank, wake up.
- Dad.

126
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,159
You don't have to go to school today.
It's okay.

127
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,279
- Why? Is it snowing?
- Do you have a black suit?

128
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,359
I overslept again.

129
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,559
We have a very important meeting
in the city. Eat that.

130
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,839
Come on.

131
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,479
Ma'am, open up, please.
It's important.

132
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:37,040
What? Oh, gosh.

133
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,880
- We don't open for half an hour.
- Just open the door. It's important.

134
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,119
I'm sorry, we don't open for half an hour.

135
00:12:43,201 --> 00:12:44,720
What's your name, ma'am?

136
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,279
- Darcy.
- Darcy. That's a pretty name.

137
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,559
I'm in a fix. I need a suit for my kid.
This is my son, Frank.

138
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,240
He needs a black suit.

139
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,479
There was a death in the family.
My father, 85 years old, war hero.

140
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,599
There's a funeral this afternoon,
military funeral,

141
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,639
planes flying overhead, 21-gun salute.

142
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,840
Frank needs to borrow a suit
for a couple of hours.

143
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,479
I'm sorry,
we don't loan suits and we're not open.

144
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,799
Darcy, please. Come back.

145
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,519
Darcy, is this yours?

146
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,359
I just found it in the parking lot.

147
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,319
Must have slipped right off your neck.

148
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,519
Don't hit the curb.

149
00:13:36,001 --> 00:13:39,560
Now get out, walk around the back
and hold the door open for me.

150
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,479
- What's next?
- Okay. Stop grinning.

151
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:55,600
When I get inside,
go back to the front seat and wait.

152
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,839
Even if a cop comes
and writes you a ticket,

153
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,919
don't move the car, understood?

154
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:01,679
Dad, what's all this for?

155
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,799
You know why the Yankees always win?

156
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,519
Because they have Mickey Mantle?

157
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,359
No, it's because the other teams can't
stop staring at those damn pinstripes.

158
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,799
Watch this. The manager
of Chase Manhattan Bank

159
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,159
is about to open the door for your father.

160
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,679
Mr. Abagnale,

161
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,319
we don't usually loan money to people

162
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,879
who have unresolved business
with the IRS.

163
00:14:24,961 --> 00:14:27,999
That's a misunderstanding.
I hired the wrong guy to do my books.

164
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:30,239
A mistake anybody could make.

165
00:14:30,321 --> 00:14:32,959
I just need you guys
to help me weather the storm.

166
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,839
You're being investigated
by the government for tax fraud.

167
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,319
My store is
a landmark in New Rochelle.

168
00:14:38,401 --> 00:14:40,479
I have customers all over New York.

169
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,599
You're not a customer
at Chase Manhattan.

170
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,760
We don't know you.

171
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,719
I'm sure your bank in New Rochelle
could help you out.

172
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,319
My bank went out of business.

173
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,559
Banks like this one
put them out of business.

174
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,799
I know I made a mistake, I admit that.
But these people want blood.

175
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,519
They want my store.
They've threatened to put me in jail.

176
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,239
This is America, right?
I'm not a criminal.

177
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,759
I'm a Medal of Honor winner. A member
of the New Rochelle Rotary Club.

178
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,239
All I'm asking is
for you to help me beat these guys.

179
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,799
It's not a question of winning and losing,
it's a question of risk.

180
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,119
You're the largest bank in the world.
Where's the...

181
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,680
Where's the risk?

182
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,039
How could you let him
take our car like that?

183
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,800
He didn't take anything, we took him.
He overpaid by 500.

184
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,399
Come on, Frank. Let's return the suit.

185
00:15:43,001 --> 00:15:44,399
This place is good.

186
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,520
It's small, but it's gonna be
a lot less work.

187
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,120
A lot less work for you.

188
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:13,479
Hey, Dad.

189
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,360
Hi.

190
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,679
Where is your mother?

191
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,279
I don't know.

192
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:26,880
She said something
about going to look for a job.

193
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,280
What's she going to be,
a shoe salesman at a centipede farm?

194
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,359
What are you doing?

195
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,399
You want some pancakes?

196
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,519
For dinner? On my son's 16th birthday?

197
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,919
We're not going to eat pancakes.

198
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,759
Why are you looking at me like that?
You thought I forgot?

199
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,799
- I didn't think you forgot.
- I opened a checking account.

200
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,719
I put $25 in the account
so you can buy whatever you want.

201
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,879
- Don't tell your mother.
- I won't.

202
00:17:02,961 --> 00:17:04,359
Thanks, Dad.

203
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,839
Didn't that bank turn you down
for a loan?

204
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,119
Yes, they all turned me down.

205
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:12,479
Then why you opening
a banking account with them?

206
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:15,280
Because one day, you'll want
something from these people.

207
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,039
A house, a car...

208
00:17:17,481 --> 00:17:19,439
They have all the money.

209
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,319
There's 50 checks there, Frank,

210
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,719
which means, from this day on,

211
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,160
you're in their little club.

212
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,640
I'm in their little club.

213
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,439
You got that, you got it all.

214
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,840
It's even got my name there.

215
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,159
- To the moon.
- To the moon.

216
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,560
To the moon.

217
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,439
See that? It's just a school.

218
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,159
No different than Westbourne.

219
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,999
Ma, you said you were going to quit.

220
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,679
Frankie, you don't have to wear
the uniform here.

221
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,239
Why don't you take off your jacket?

222
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,080
I'm used to it.

223
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,839
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

224
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,720
Do you know where room 17,
French is?

225
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,879
Yeah...

226
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,559
You selling encyclopedias?

227
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,119
He looks like a substitute teacher.

228
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,879
Quiet down, people!

229
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,120
My name is Mr. Abagnale!

230
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,680
That's Abagnale, not Abagnolee,

231
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,560
not Abagnelee, but Abagnale.

232
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,719
Now, somebody please tell me
where you left off in your textbooks.

233
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,279
Excuse me, people.
If I need to ask again,

234
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,639
I'm gonna write up the entire class.

235
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,319
Take your seats!

236
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,239
Chapter seven.

237
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,959
Would you please open your textbooks
to chapter eight

238
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,879
and we'll get started.

239
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,519
- Excuse me. What's your name?
- Brad.

240
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,080
Why don't you get up here

241
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,759
in front of the class
and read conversation number five?

242
00:19:51,921 --> 00:19:53,519
They sent for me.

243
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,359
They said they needed
a sub for Roberta.

244
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,760
I came all the way from Dixon.

245
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,959
I always sub for Roberta.

246
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,159
Excuse me, why aren't you reading?

247
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,839
I'll never come back
to Bellarmine-Jefferson again!

248
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,799
You tell them not to call me.

249
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,160
Do they think it's easy
for a woman my age

250
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,720
and all the money that it costs to travel?
I tell you, they don't give a damn.

251
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,319
Mr. and Mrs. Abagnale,

252
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,079
this is not a question
of your son's attendance.

253
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,039
I regret to inform you
that for the past week,

254
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,560
Frank has been teaching
Mrs. Glasser's French class.

255
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,599
He what?

256
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:34,679
Your son has been pretending to be
a substitute teacher.

257
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,199
Lecturing the students,
giving out homework...

258
00:20:38,681 --> 00:20:40,759
Mrs. Glasser has been ill,

259
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,880
and there was some confusion
with the real sub.

260
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,799
Your son held
a teacher-parent conference yesterday

261
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,119
and was planning a class field trip

262
00:20:50,201 --> 00:20:52,800
to a French bread factory in Trenton.

263
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,080
Do you see the problem we have?

264
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:01,759
I've a note to miss fifth and sixth period
today. Doctor's appointment.

265
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,320
One moment. I'll be right with you.

266
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,999
- You should fold it.
- What?

267
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,400
That note. It's a fake, right?
You should fold it.

268
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,160
It's a note from my mom.
I have a doctor's appointment.

269
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,959
Yeah, but there's no crease
in the paper.

270
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:19,799
When your mom hands you a note
to miss school,

271
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,639
the first thing you do is fold it
and put it in your pocket.

272
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,120
If it's real, where's the crease?

273
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,719
Frankie.

274
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,359
Ma, I'm home.

275
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,440
Remember that girl Joanna
I was telling you about?

276
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,640
I asked her out today.

277
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,639
Think we're going to go
to the junior prom.

278
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,999
Ma, is this my driver's license?

279
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,520
That's all there is, two bedrooms.

280
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,880
Frankie.

281
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,039
You remember Dad's friend?

282
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,639
Jack Barnes. From the club.

283
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,839
Hello.

284
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:21,039
He came by looking for your father.

285
00:22:21,121 --> 00:22:23,559
I was giving him a tour of the apartment.

286
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,439
It's very spacious, Paula.

287
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,759
Dad is at the store.

288
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,879
So, Frank,

289
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,239
you're getting to look
more like your old man every day.

290
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,399
Thanks for the sandwich, Paula.

291
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,320
- I'll see you later.
- Wait.

292
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,079
Is this yours?

293
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,679
Thanks, Frank.
That's the President's pin.

294
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,640
I'd be in deep trouble if I lost that.

295
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,079
I'll see you all later.

296
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,679
Are you hungry, Frankie?
I'll make you a sandwich.

297
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,279
Jack wanted to talk business
with your father.

298
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,959
He thinks we should get a lawyer
and sue the government.

299
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,759
That it's not legal,
what they're doing to us.

300
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,760
Why aren't you saying anything?

301
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:57,599
You're not going to tell him, are you?

302
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,119
No.

303
00:24:00,961 --> 00:24:03,599
That's right. There's nothing to tell.

304
00:24:04,801 --> 00:24:09,079
I'm going out for a few hours to visit
some old friends from the tennis club.

305
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,279
When I get home,
we'll all have dinner together.

306
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,799
Right?

307
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,079
But you won't say anything
because it's just silly,

308
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,480
isn't it?

309
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,959
How could we sue anybody?

310
00:24:27,441 --> 00:24:29,760
Do you need some money, Frankie?

311
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,119
A few dollars to buy
some record albums?

312
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,479
Here. Take $5.

313
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,239
Or 10.

314
00:24:43,881 --> 00:24:46,399
You promised you were going to quit.

315
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,079
Ma, I'm home.

316
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,600
Hey, hey!

317
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,399
You stay away from me. You hear me?

318
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,079
I don't know who you are,
but if you come back here...

319
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,039
Frank, calm down, will you?
I'm Dick Keener.

320
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,319
I want you to leave your things here,
follow me into the next room.

321
00:25:33,401 --> 00:25:35,839
Okay? They're all waiting for you.

322
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,520
You don't have to be scared.
I'm right here, Frank.

323
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,320
I'll always be here.

324
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,319
But there are laws. Everything in
this country has to be legal.

325
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,040
So what we need to do
is make some decisions.

326
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,519
That's what Mr. Keener is here for.

327
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,199
Many times these decisions
are left up to the courts.

328
00:25:53,281 --> 00:25:56,199
But that can be very expensive,
people fighting over their children.

329
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,479
Nobody is fighting.

330
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,199
Look at me, Frank. Nobody is fighting.

331
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,359
Do you remember your grandma? Eve?
She arrived this morning.

332
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,199
Hello.

333
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,279
Do you understand
what we're saying to you, Frank?

334
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,639
Your father and I are getting a divorce.

335
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,439
Nothing's going to change.
We're still gonna see each other.

336
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,959
- Stop it, please. Don't interrupt.
- You don't have to read all of this.

337
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:42,679
Most of it is for your parents,
boring adult business.

338
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,279
But this paragraph right here,
this is important

339
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,400
because it states
who you're gonna live with

340
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,880
after the divorce.

341
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,759
Whose custody you will be in.

342
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,359
And there's a blank space right here.

343
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,879
I want you to go into the kitchen,
sit at the table

344
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,399
and put a name down.

345
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,599
You can take as long as you want,

346
00:27:02,681 --> 00:27:04,159
but when you come back into this room,

347
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,640
I want to see a name on that line.

348
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,399
Frank, just write down
a name and this will all be over.

349
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,079
It's going to be okay.

350
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,759
Dad, what name?

351
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,079
Your mother or your father.

352
00:27:15,161 --> 00:27:17,919
Just put the name there.
It's as simple as that.

353
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,079
And don't look so scared. It's not a test.

354
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,800
There's no wrong answer.

355
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,679
One ticket to Grand Central, please.

356
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,719
That will be $3.50, sir.

357
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,359
Is it okay if I write you a check?

358
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,679
Carl, when do I get to call my father?

359
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,600
You can call him when we get
to New York.

360
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,759
We leave for the airport in seven hours.

361
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,240
Until then, just sit there.

362
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,679
Be quiet.

363
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,359
On the other side of the hotel,
they got suites that face the park.

364
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,319
It's the best room the F.B.I. can afford.

365
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,359
It's okay, I've stayed in worse.

366
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,679
Please. You have to listen.

367
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,959
I don't want to hear your story.
Two checks bounced.

368
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,759
You know how much trouble I'm in?

369
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,239
No, but listen. I'm telling you.
The bank, they made the mistake.

370
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,879
I'll write you another check right now!

371
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,919
What? Do I look like
I was born yesterday?

372
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,759
Look, it's midnight.
Where am I going to go?

373
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,079
You're a goddamn kid. Go home.

374
00:29:21,321 --> 00:29:24,719
I hope you understand. My boss
sent me to Brooklyn, then Queens.

375
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,199
Now he wants me in Long Island

376
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,959
to take a few clients out
for a night on the town.

377
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,799
I'm sorry, but we're not allowed
to cash checks from other banks.

378
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,679
- How would we know if they were good?
- What did you say your name was?

379
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,399
- Ashley.
- Ashley.

380
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,599
You know what I found
on the sidewalk out there?

381
00:29:45,321 --> 00:29:47,959
Must have slipped right off your neck.

382
00:29:51,921 --> 00:29:54,839
Is there something
I can help you with, son?

383
00:29:54,921 --> 00:29:57,120
It's my grandmother's birthday
next week

384
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,720
and I want to get her something
extra special.

385
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,479
Please, it's my midterm next week
and my books were stolen.

386
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,719
Please, just $5.
No one would have to know.

387
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,039
I'm sorry,
but we are not allowed to take checks

388
00:30:11,121 --> 00:30:13,160
from people we don't know.

389
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,959
Welcome to New York.

390
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,759
Pleasure to have you back, Captain.

391
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,799
What do you think, Angelo?
The tomatoes are ripe this afternoon.

392
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,879
What have we here?

393
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,959
- Can I have your autograph?
- You betcha.

394
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,999
- Can I have your autograph, too?
- You gonna be a pilot?

395
00:31:12,961 --> 00:31:14,639
There you go. Work hard in school.

396
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,999
Dear Dad,

397
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,479
I've decided to become an airline pilot.

398
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,319
I've applied to all the big airlines,

399
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,359
and I have several promising interviews
lined up.

400
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,400
How is Mom?
Have you called her lately?

401
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,959
Love, your son, Frank.

402
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,639
Hello.

403
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,400
I'm Frank Black
from Murrow High School,

404
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,079
and I have an appointment
with Mr. Morgan.

405
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,839
You're the young man who's writing
the article for the school paper.

406
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,879
Yes, ma'am. That's me.

407
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,279
I want to know everything there is
to know about being a pilot.

408
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,440
What airports does Pan Am fly to?
What does a pilot make in a year?

409
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,159
Who tells them where they're gonna
fly to?

410
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,359
- Slow down. Take them one at a time.
- All right.

411
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,079
What does it mean when
one pilot says to another pilot,

412
00:31:56,161 --> 00:31:57,279
What kind of equipment are you on?

413
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,039
They want to know what aircraft
you're flying. DC-8, 707, Constellation...

414
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,999
And what about those I.D. badges
that I've seen pilots wear?

415
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,320
Every pilot must have two things
with him at all times.

416
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,759
One is his airline personnel badge,
looks just like this one from Pan Am.

417
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,319
The other one is their FAA license.

418
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,800
And that looks just like this.

419
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,119
Do you think I could make a copy
of this to put into my article?

420
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,199
Frank, you can have that one,
it's three years expired.

421
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,279
Thanks. And what about
your I.D. badge?

422
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,600
Do you have an extra one
I could borrow?

423
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,159
No, I can't help you there.

424
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,679
Those are special-ordered
from Polaroid.

425
00:32:29,761 --> 00:32:32,479
The only way to get one
is to become a real live pilot

426
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,959
for Pan American Airways.

427
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,399
Pan Am, may I help you?

428
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,719
Yeah. Hello, I'm calling about a uniform.

429
00:32:42,801 --> 00:32:44,959
- Hold for Purchasing.
- Thank you.

430
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,199
Purchasing.

431
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,839
I'm a copilot based out of
San Francisco.

432
00:32:48,961 --> 00:32:50,999
I flew a flight into New York last night,

433
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,239
but the problem is I'm headed out
to Paris in three hours.

434
00:32:54,321 --> 00:32:55,919
How can we help you?

435
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,359
I sent my uniform to be cleaned
through the hotel

436
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,319
and I guess they must have lost it.

437
00:33:01,441 --> 00:33:03,640
They lost a uniform.
Happens all the time.

438
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,559
Go down to the Well-Built Uniform
Company at 9th and Broadway.

439
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,679
They're our uniform supplier.

440
00:33:07,761 --> 00:33:09,680
I'll tell Mr. Rosen you're coming.

441
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,639
You look too young to be a pilot.

442
00:33:11,721 --> 00:33:13,279
I'm a copilot.

443
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,079
Why so nervous?

444
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,559
How would you feel if you lost
your uniform first week on the job?

445
00:33:19,681 --> 00:33:22,560
Relax.
Pan Am has got lots of uniforms.

446
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,799
It's gonna be $164.

447
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,679
Great. I'll write you a check.

448
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,799
Sorry, no checks, no cash.

449
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,279
You'll have to fill in
your employee I.D. number.

450
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,319
I'll bill Pan Am, and they'll take it out
of your next paycheck.

451
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,719
Even better.

452
00:33:40,801 --> 00:33:41,959
Dear Dad,

453
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,999
you always told me
that an honest man has nothing to fear.

454
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,839
So I'm trying my best not to be afraid.

455
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,919
I'm sorry I ran away,
but you don't have to worry.

456
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,200
I'm gonna get it all back now, Daddy.
I promise. I'm gonna get it all back.

457
00:34:01,641 --> 00:34:03,199
Are you a real live pilot?

458
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,439
I sure am, little lady. What's your name?

459
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,080
- Celine.
- Celine, it's a pleasure to meet you.

460
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,479
It's a pleasure to meet you, too.

461
00:34:14,121 --> 00:34:18,319
That's 50, 70, 80, 90,

462
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,079
$100.

463
00:34:20,161 --> 00:34:22,360
You have yourself a great time in Paris.

464
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,839
I always do.

465
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,759
Excuse me.

466
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,959
I'm John Modiger. I manage this branch.

467
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,159
I want to thank you for coming in
and using our institution.

468
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:33,239
It's a pleasure to meet you, John.
I'll be back again.

469
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:34,280
Good.

470
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,799
Have you stayed with us before?

471
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,239
No, I've been primarily based
on the West Coast.

472
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,640
Is it all right if I write you a check
for the room?

473
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,679
- No problem, sir.
- Great.

474
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,799
I was also wondering
if I could write you a personal check?

475
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,959
For airline personnel,
we cash personal checks up to $100.

476
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,639
Payroll checks we cash up to 300.

477
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,759
Did you say 300 for a payroll check?

478
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,879
Dear Dad,

479
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,319
I've decided to become a pilot
for Pan American Airways,

480
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,719
the most trusted name in the skies.

481
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,839
They've accepted me into their training
program and told me if I work hard,

482
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,080
I should earn my wings real soon.

483
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,159
Please get in touch with Joanna Carlton
from the 10th grade.

484
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,240
Tell her I'm sorry that I could not
take her to the junior prom.

485
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,519
Love, your son, Frank.

486
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,599
- Hello, how are you?
- Fine, thank you.

487
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,720
I have a payroll check I'd like to cash.

488
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,199
Certainly.

489
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,159
Excuse me.

490
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,799
I'm sure you hear this all the time,

491
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,319
but you have the most beautiful eyes
I have ever seen.

492
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,440
Yeah, I do get that all the time.

493
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,760
How would you like it?

494
00:36:44,721 --> 00:36:48,839
I'm sorry, sir. We won't have any cash
until the banks open in an hour.

495
00:36:48,961 --> 00:36:52,319
But I'm sure they can cash your check
at the airport.

496
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,239
The airport?

497
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,519
Who cashes checks at the airport?

498
00:36:56,641 --> 00:36:59,999
The airlines.
They've always taken care of their own.

499
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,919
- Hello.
- Hi. Are you deadheading?

500
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,519
What?

501
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,880
Are you my deadhead to Miami?

502
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,399
Yes.

503
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,759
Yeah, I'm the deadhead. Here you go.

504
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,440
You're a little late,
but the jump seat is open.

505
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,599
It's been a while since I've done this.
Which one is the jump seat again?

506
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,599
Have a nice flight.

507
00:37:34,761 --> 00:37:36,599
Are you my deadhead?

508
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,959
Frank, Captain Oliver.
John Larkin, the copilot.

509
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,759
Fred Tulley, flight engineer.

510
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,479
Frank Taylor, Pan Am.
Thanks for giving me a lift, boys.

511
00:37:46,561 --> 00:37:49,359
Go ahead and take a seat, Frank.
We're about to push.

512
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:51,519
What kind of equipment you on, DC-8?

513
00:37:51,641 --> 00:37:52,679
707.

514
00:37:53,001 --> 00:37:55,119
You turning around on the redeye?

515
00:37:55,201 --> 00:37:57,439
I'm jumping puddles
for the next few months,

516
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:00,639
trying to earn my keep running
leap frogs for the weak and weary.

517
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,199
No shame in that. We all did it.

518
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,039
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

519
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,199
Would you like a drink after takeoff?

520
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,439
Milk?

521
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,719
- Eighty knots.
- Check.

522
00:38:19,201 --> 00:38:20,759
V-one. Rotate.

523
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,439
V-two. Positive rate.

524
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,759
Gear up.

525
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,079
Dear Dad,
today was graduation.

526
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:35,039
I am now a copilot,
earning $1,400 a month, plus benefits.

527
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,119
And the best part is,
they tell me my family can fly for free.

528
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,960
So tell Mom to pack her bags
and buy a new swimsuit

529
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,319
because I'm taking us all to Hawaii
for Christmas.

530
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,680
I love you, Dad. Aloha, Frank.

531
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,959
- Hello, deadhead.
- Hello.

532
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,999
Enjoying your free ride?

533
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,999
Marci,

534
00:39:01,161 --> 00:39:02,879
did you drop this?

535
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,639
- Must have slipped right off your neck.
- No.

536
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,320
No!

537
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,359
Yes, yes, yes!

538
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,720
Why are you stopping?

539
00:39:27,081 --> 00:39:29,599
I want to tell you something, Marci.

540
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,799
This is by far

541
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,960
the best date I have ever been on.

542
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,479
Welcome to Miami Mutual Bank.
How may I help you?

543
00:40:10,561 --> 00:40:13,079
My name is Frank Taylor.
I'm a copilot for Pan Am.

544
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:16,159
I'd like to cash this check and then

545
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,359
I'd like to take you out for a steak dinner.

546
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,759
Then we feed the checks
into the MICR machine,

547
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,239
which uses special ink to encode

548
00:40:33,321 --> 00:40:35,999
the account numbers
on the bottom of the checks.

549
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,879
And where are these numbers?

550
00:40:40,601 --> 00:40:42,559
- They're right here.
- Right there?

551
00:40:46,081 --> 00:40:48,000
They're called routing numbers.

552
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,719
So where do the checks get routed to?

553
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,159
I don't exactly know.
Nobody ever asked me that before.

554
00:40:56,641 --> 00:40:59,920
Our next item up for bid is also from
the Jersey Central Bank foreclosure.

555
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,199
This is a MICR encoder,
a machine used to encode bank checks.

556
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,639
Do I have an opening bid?

557
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,479
Our unknown subject
is a paperhanger

558
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,959
who started working on the East Coast.

559
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,680
In the last few weeks,
this unsub has developed

560
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,560
a new form of check fraud
which I'm calling "The Float".

561
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,399
What he's doing is he's opening
checking accounts at various banks,

562
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,839
then changing the MICR ink routing
numbers at the bottom of those checks.

563
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:22,479
Next slide, please. Next slide, please.

564
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,799
The remote thing is broken.
You'll have to do it by hand.

565
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,200
Agent Mullen, it should be
the square button by the side.

566
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,599
This carousel doesn't work.
It's a bad carousel.

567
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,399
- Thank you.
- Move it manually.

568
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,999
This is a map of the 12 banks
of the U.S. Federal Reserve.

569
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,279
Slide.

570
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,519
MICR scanners at every bank
read these numbers

571
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,479
at the bottom of the check. Slide.

572
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,760
And then ship that check off
to its corresponding branch.

573
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:52,199
Carl, for those of us
who are unfamiliar with bank fraud,

574
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,439
you mind telling us
what the hell you're talking about?

575
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,440
The East Coast branches
are numbered 01 to 06.

576
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,999
The central branch is 07, 08,
so on and so forth.

577
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,639
You mean those numbers at the bottom
of a check actually mean something?

578
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,559
All of this was in the report I filed
two days ago. If you change

579
00:42:08,641 --> 00:42:12,799
a 02 to a 12, that means that check,

580
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,159
which was cashed in New York,

581
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,640
does not go
to the New York Federal Branch,

582
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,880
but it is re-routed all the way
to the San Francisco Federal Branch.

583
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,360
The bank doesn't even know
the check has bounced for two weeks.

584
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,960
Which means our unsub
can stay in one place,

585
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,639
paper the same city over and over again
while his checks circle the country.

586
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,879
You want to talk to my wife.

587
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,600
She's the one who balances
the checkbook at our house.

588
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,159
Next slide.

589
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,159
Daddy.

590
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,999
My son, the birdman.
That's some uniform, Frank.

591
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,759
What do you think?

592
00:42:55,401 --> 00:42:56,519
Nice.

593
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,079
Sit down.

594
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,599
Dad, have you gotten the postcards?

595
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,880
Of course.

596
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,399
This fork is ice-cold.

597
00:43:06,521 --> 00:43:09,319
No, Dad, that's a chilled salad fork.

598
00:43:11,041 --> 00:43:13,439
It's a fancy restaurant, you know.

599
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,280
Here.

600
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,199
- I got you something.
- What's that?

601
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,559
Open it.

602
00:43:29,841 --> 00:43:32,119
You know what those are, right?

603
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:37,039
Those are the keys
to a 1965 Cadillac DeVille convertible.

604
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:40,400
Brand-new, Dad.
Red with white interior,

605
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,680
split seats, air conditioning, the works.

606
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,919
Are you giving me a Cadillac?

607
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,999
I'm giving you a Cadillac.

608
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:50,079
Dad, she's parked downstairs.

609
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,359
When we're done eating lunch, why
don't you drive on over to Mom's house,

610
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,359
pick her up, take a little joy ride?

611
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,039
Do you know what would happen

612
00:43:57,121 --> 00:44:00,759
if the IRS found out I was driving around
in a new coupe?

613
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,919
I took the train here, Frank.
I'm taking the train home.

614
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,239
All right.

615
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,999
I have plenty of money.

616
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,319
You know, if you ever need anything.

617
00:44:20,441 --> 00:44:22,959
You worried? About me?

618
00:44:24,001 --> 00:44:25,839
No, I'm not worried.

619
00:44:25,921 --> 00:44:27,919
You think I can't buy my own car?

620
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,199
Two mice fell in a bucket
of cream, Frank.

621
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,679
Which one am I?

622
00:44:34,561 --> 00:44:36,559
You're that second mouse.

623
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:40,399
I went by the store today.

624
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,039
I had to close the store for a while.
It's all about timing, Frank.

625
00:44:45,121 --> 00:44:48,079
Goddamn government knows that.
They hit you when you're down.

626
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,880
I wasn't going to let them take it
from me, so I just

627
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,360
shut the doors myself, called their bluff.

628
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,719
Sooner or later, they'll forget about me.

629
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,239
I understand.

630
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,599
Have you told Ma?

631
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,959
She's so stubborn, your mother.

632
00:45:14,481 --> 00:45:17,360
Don't worry, I'm not going to let her go
without a fight.

633
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,319
I'm fighting for us...

634
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,879
Dad?

635
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,599
Since the day we met.

636
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,719
Daddy, out of all those men,

637
00:45:31,201 --> 00:45:33,759
you were the one that took her home,
remember that?

638
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,119
Two hundred men

639
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,559
sitting in that tiny social hall,
watching her dance.

640
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,439
- What was the name of that town?
- Montrichard, Dad.

641
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,359
I didn't speak a word of French,

642
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,879
and six weeks later, she was my wife.

643
00:45:52,321 --> 00:45:53,919
She is your wife.

644
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:00,479
My son bought me a Cadillac today.
I think that calls for a toast.

645
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,359
To the best damn pilot in the sky.

646
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,399
It's not what you think. I'm just a copilot.

647
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,599
You see these people staring at you?

648
00:46:24,001 --> 00:46:27,079
These are the most powerful people
in New York City.

649
00:46:27,161 --> 00:46:31,759
They keep peeking over their shoulders,
wondering where you're going tonight.

650
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,639
Where you going, Frank?

651
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,879
Dad, nobody's staring at me.

652
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,000
Some place exotic?

653
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,520
Just tell me where you're going.

654
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:46,799
Los... Hollywood.

655
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:48,359
Hollywood?

656
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,359
Come here.

657
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,679
The rest of us
really are suckers.

658
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,359
So I got on this red dress
and these high heels, right?

659
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,959
I got a bra out here.

660
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:10,480
I'm chasing two Puerto Rican guys
through the park.

661
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,039
They got a suitcase
filled with bank robbery loot.

662
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,519
Okay, I'm screaming out,
F.B.I. freeze!

663
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,959
I'm reaching for my gun,
but I can't find it in the bra.

664
00:47:18,041 --> 00:47:20,559
It's so damn big,
I thought I was going to shoot my tits off.

665
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,279
That's a funny story.
People always laugh at that story.

666
00:47:27,361 --> 00:47:28,919
Let me ask you a question,
Mr. Amdursky.

667
00:47:29,001 --> 00:47:32,479
If you had so much fun undercover,
why did you transfer to bank fraud?

668
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,720
I didn't transfer.
I was censured and reassigned.

669
00:47:36,281 --> 00:47:39,639
It's like being punished. I was punished.
I screwed up in the field.

670
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,639
What about you, Mr. Fox, were you
punished for screwing up in the field?

671
00:47:42,721 --> 00:47:44,839
No, I've never worked in the field before.

672
00:47:44,921 --> 00:47:46,399
I audited background investigations

673
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,959
of Department of Justice
clerical applicants.

674
00:47:49,041 --> 00:47:53,359
That's just great. I ask for a team
and they drag the bottom of the Pacific.

675
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,079
Mind if I ask you a question,
Agent Hanratty?

676
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,680
How come you're so serious
all the time?

677
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,239
Does it bother you, Mr. Amdursky?

678
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,279
Yeah, it does bother me.

679
00:48:02,601 --> 00:48:04,400
Does it bother you, Mr. Fox?

680
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,160
A little, I guess.

681
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,799
Would you like to hear me tell a joke?

682
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,879
Yeah, we'd love to hear a joke from you.

683
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,919
Knock, knock.

684
00:48:17,001 --> 00:48:18,399
Who's there?

685
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,679
Go fuck yourselves.

686
00:48:35,521 --> 00:48:38,079
He cashed three checks.
They all cleared.

687
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,159
I was going to deposit this one today.

688
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,999
I don't want any trouble.

689
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,959
No trouble.

690
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,959
No trouble at all.

691
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,039
We'll just take this check
and be on our way. Thank you.

692
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,080
Because I don't want
my customers harassed.

693
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,679
What are you saying? He's still here?

694
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,480
201.

695
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,599
Thank you.

696
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,679
- Corner here.
- Thanks, son.

697
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,199
- Some steps.
- Steps.

698
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,679
Mr. Murphy, how are you?

699
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,279
- Is that Frank?
- Yeah, it's Frank.

700
00:49:17,361 --> 00:49:19,439
- Hey, Frank. How are you?
- How's the knee?

701
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,600
Come on, I'll race you right now.

702
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:23,319
- Take care.
- Okay, Frank.

703
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:25,759
Eyeball the back? Come on, Carl.

704
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,640
This guy's a pen-and-ink man,
a goddamn paperhanger.

705
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,479
Why can't we go with you, Carl?

706
00:49:29,561 --> 00:49:33,959
Keep your eyes open, do your job
and I'll buy you both a Good Humor bar.

707
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,399
It's all right, ma'am. F.B.I.

708
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,879
201.

709
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,759
F.B.I.!

710
00:50:11,521 --> 00:50:12,679
F.B.I.

711
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,640
Come out of the bathroom!

712
00:50:16,601 --> 00:50:18,599
Step out of the bathroom!

713
00:50:22,361 --> 00:50:24,960
- Hands on your head.
- That's the new IBM Selectric...

714
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,119
- Put your hands on your head!
- print type in five seconds...

715
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,400
Shut up!

716
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,359
Put your hands on your head!

717
00:50:30,441 --> 00:50:34,239
He's got over 200 checks,
a gallon of India ink, drafting...

718
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,559
Even has little payroll envelopes
addressed to himself...

719
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,839
- Put it down! Drop it!
- Relax!

720
00:50:39,361 --> 00:50:41,039
You're late, all right?

721
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,799
My name's Allen, Barry Allen,
United States Secret Service.

722
00:50:43,881 --> 00:50:45,439
Your boy just tried
to jump out the window.

723
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,879
- My partner has him in custody.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

724
00:50:48,961 --> 00:50:52,400
You think the F.B.I.
are the only ones on this guy? Come on.

725
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,479
He's dabbling in government checks.

726
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:58,160
We've been following a paper trail
on this guy for months now.

727
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,480
You mind taking that gun
out of my face?

728
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,479
Please. Really. It makes me nervous.

729
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,199
Let me see some credentials.

730
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,119
Yeah, sure.

731
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,719
Take my whole wallet.

732
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:13,119
You want my gun, too?
Come over here, take my gun.

733
00:51:13,521 --> 00:51:14,559
Hey. Hey, look.

734
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,799
Just do me a favor, take a look outside.
Look out the window.

735
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,879
My partner's walking him to the car
as we speak. Look.

736
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,439
Old guy almost pissed in his pants
when I came through the door.

737
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:29,879
He jumped right through the window
onto the hood of my car.

738
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,600
Murph?

739
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:35,279
Call the LAPD. I don't want
people walking through my crime scene.

740
00:51:37,521 --> 00:51:40,199
I didn't expect
the Secret Service on this.

741
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,039
Don't worry about it.
What's your name?

742
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:45,880
Hanratty, Carl Hanratty.

743
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,719
Mind if I see some identification?

744
00:51:54,521 --> 00:51:57,319
You never can be
too careful these days.

745
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,039
Well, tough luck, Carl.

746
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,639
Five minutes earlier, you would've
landed yourself a pretty good collar.

747
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,519
Is that right? Ten seconds later,
you'd have been shot.

748
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,880
Mind if I come downstairs with you?
I got to take a look at this guy.

749
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:12,319
Sure thing. Just do me a favor
and sit tight for a sec

750
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,959
while I get this evidence downstairs.

751
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:16,959
I don't want some maid walking
through here and making the bed.

752
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,519
- LAPD should be here any sec.
- Wait.

753
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,079
Your wallet.

754
00:52:25,921 --> 00:52:28,639
You hang onto it for a minute.
I trust you.

755
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,999
Secret Service.

756
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,199
Hey!

757
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,120
God damn it!

758
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,279
It was stupid. I made a stupid mistake.

759
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,319
Forget about it.

760
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,839
There are hundreds
of unknown subjects out there.

761
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:46,000
I can get this guy. The worst thing
a paperhanger can do is show his face.

762
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,359
I read the report.

763
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,960
Six feet tall, brown hair,
27 to 30 years of age, 160 pounds.

764
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,559
This could be almost anybody.

765
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,640
I heard his voice. I saw his face.

766
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,599
There's nothing for him
to hide behind anymore.

767
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,239
Just be careful.

768
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,279
You got 12 years in.

769
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,999
Nobody bothers you down
on the first floor.

770
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,759
You practically wrote
the book on bank fraud.

771
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,799
That's the kind of thing that can
make you section chief someday.

772
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:11,039
Just don't put yourself
in this type of position.

773
00:54:11,241 --> 00:54:12,439
What type of position?

774
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,479
The position of being humiliated.

775
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,079
Sean, would you like to hear me
tell a joke?

776
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:29,639
Yeah. Sure.

777
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,240
Knock, knock.

778
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:39,239
My next question is,
when a pilot retires,

779
00:54:40,041 --> 00:54:42,520
Pan Am sends them a check
every single month?

780
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,239
Yeah, pension program
sends a check and benefits.

781
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:46,719
How much is that check for?

782
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,719
Kid, I'm really not in the mood
for this right now.

783
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,679
This Skywayman's driving me crazy.

784
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:51,919
Who's the Skywayman?

785
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,959
Some nut flying around the country,
posing as a Pan Am pilot.

786
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:57,759
There's a column about him
in the paper today.

787
00:55:03,921 --> 00:55:07,600
I keep telling them it's not my problem.
This guy doesn't even fly Pan Am.

788
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,599
Flies everybody else.
Flies United, TWA,

789
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,319
Continental, Eastern.

790
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,279
The Skywayman.

791
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,839
Newspaper loves this clown.

792
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,680
They call him the James Bond
of the sky.

793
00:55:22,561 --> 00:55:23,520
Did you say...

794
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,160
Bond, James Bond.

795
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,839
Tell me, Joan,
why does he do it?

796
00:55:36,961 --> 00:55:38,399
He likes to win.

797
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,679
We'll be landing in 20 minutes.

798
00:55:40,801 --> 00:55:43,479
Do you want to play it easy,
or the hard way?

799
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,200
And this isn't a tranquilizer.

800
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,200
Pussy, you know a lot more
about planes than guns.

801
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,319
Hello, Pussy.

802
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,079
You're sure this is the suit, right?

803
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,279
Positive.

804
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,399
It's the exact suit he wore in the movie.

805
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,640
Okay. I'll take three.

806
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,359
Certainly, Mr. Fleming.

807
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,520
Now all you need is one of those
little foreign sports cars that he drives.

808
00:56:31,001 --> 00:56:32,479
- Hello.
- Hi.

809
00:56:36,201 --> 00:56:38,039
Haven't I seen you before?

810
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,719
Maybe.

811
00:56:42,241 --> 00:56:45,279
A couple of years ago,
I was on the cover of Seventeen.

812
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,879
You're that model, right? Cheryl.

813
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,599
Guys used to put your picture
on their lockers.

814
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:58,079
Isn't that your silver car
I saw parked out front?

815
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:00,480
Yeah. One of them.

816
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,159
So, think I could get an autograph?

817
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,279
Do you have a pen in your room?

818
00:57:50,401 --> 00:57:53,119
A man like you can buy
anything he wants.

819
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:07,359
He buys a deck of cards
at the hotel gift shop.

820
00:58:10,561 --> 00:58:12,319
You want to see a card trick?

821
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,799
How much did these cards cost?

822
00:58:17,561 --> 00:58:19,839
I don't know, 55 cents, I think.

823
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:26,880
And if they sold me downstairs
at the hotel gift shop,

824
00:58:28,801 --> 00:58:30,720
how much would you pay?

825
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,279
I'm sorry, how much would
I pay for what?

826
00:58:39,081 --> 00:58:40,639
The entire night.

827
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:45,919
How much would you pay me
for the entire night?

828
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,959
Cheryl, I really don't know.

829
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:56,640
Don't be scared.

830
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,599
Make me an offer.

831
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,359
300?

832
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,079
Go fish.

833
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,359
$500?

834
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,279
Go fish.

835
00:59:22,561 --> 00:59:23,959
600.

836
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:26,999
Go fish!

837
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,480
$1,000.

838
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,040
Okay.

839
00:59:36,961 --> 00:59:38,719
$1,000.

840
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,599
Okay.

841
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:43,879
I'll be right back.

842
00:59:44,641 --> 00:59:46,199
Wait a second, where are you going?

843
00:59:46,281 --> 00:59:48,639
I'm going downstairs to cash a check.

844
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,280
You think this hotel is going to cash
a $1,000 check at 3:00 a.m.?

845
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:59,839
It's a New York Savings and Loan
check. It's like gold. They'll cash it.

846
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,560
Don't you think they might get
a little suspicious? Let me see that.

847
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:08,559
It's a cashier's check.
Endorse it over to me.

848
01:00:08,641 --> 01:00:10,079
I couldn't do that.

849
01:00:10,161 --> 01:00:13,440
This check is for 1,400.
We agreed upon 1,000.

850
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:17,439
Why don't I give you back 400

851
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,279
and you give me that check?

852
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:22,879
Even better.

853
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,479
Does this belong to anybody?

854
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,279
This is Hanratty. Merry Christmas.

855
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,719
Hello, Carl.

856
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:16,559
Hello.

857
01:01:18,721 --> 01:01:20,959
Barry Allen, Secret Service.

858
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:25,519
I've been trying to track you down now
for the last couple of hours.

859
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:26,719
What do you want?

860
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:31,039
I wanted to apologize
for what happened out in Los Angeles.

861
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,399
No, you don't apologize to me.

862
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:37,240
Do you always work
on Christmas Eve, Carl?

863
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,440
I volunteered

864
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,559
so the men with families
could go home early.

865
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,519
Looked like you were wearing
a wedding ring out in Los Angeles.

866
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,319
I thought maybe you had a family.

867
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,080
No. No family.

868
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:53,319
You want to talk to me?
Let's talk face to face.

869
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:54,839
All right.

870
01:01:54,921 --> 01:01:58,439
I'm at my suite
at the Stuyvesant Arms, room 3113.

871
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:01,879
In the morning, I leave for Las Vegas
for the weekend.

872
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,399
You think you're going to get me again?

873
01:02:07,001 --> 01:02:10,479
You're not going to Vegas,
you're not in the Stuyvesant Arms.

874
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:16,279
You'd love for me to send out 20 agents,
Christmas Eve, barge into your hotel,

875
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:18,839
knock down the door
so you can make fools out of us all.

876
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,679
I'm really sorry if I made a fool
out of you. I really am.

877
01:02:22,761 --> 01:02:24,039
No.

878
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:26,999
No. You do not feel sorry for me.

879
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:31,519
The truth is, I knew it was you.
I didn't get the cuffs on you, but I knew.

880
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:35,359
People only know
what you tell them, Carl.

881
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,319
Then tell me this,
Barry Allen, Secret Service.

882
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:42,479
How did you know
I wouldn't look in your wallet?

883
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:45,439
The same reason
the Yankees always win.

884
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:48,560
Nobody can keep their eyes
off the pinstripes.

885
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,359
The Yankees win
because they have Mickey Mantle.

886
01:02:51,441 --> 01:02:53,599
No one ever bets on the uniform.

887
01:02:54,321 --> 01:02:56,279
You sure about that, Carl?

888
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:58,560
I'll tell you what I am sure of.

889
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:00,480
You're going to get caught.

890
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:04,600
One way or another,
it's a mathematical fact. It's like Vegas.

891
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,399
The house always wins.

892
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:14,999
Well, Carl, I'm sorry, but I have to go.

893
01:03:16,401 --> 01:03:18,959
You didn't call just to apologize,
did you?

894
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:21,359
What do you mean?

895
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:24,999
You have no one else to call.

896
01:04:00,961 --> 01:04:02,439
More coffee, sir?

897
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:11,199
- Are you a collector?
- Of what?

898
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:12,559
Captives of the Cosmic Ray,

899
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,519
The Big Freeze,
Land of the Golden Giants.

900
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:17,119
- I've got them all.
- What are you talking about?

901
01:04:17,841 --> 01:04:19,039
Barry Allen.

902
01:04:22,081 --> 01:04:23,079
The Flash.

903
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:26,559
Wait, kid.

904
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:30,599
You mean, like the comic book?

905
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:33,600
Yeah, the comic book. When he's not
The Flash, that's his name, Barry Allen.

906
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:36,679
Thank you.

907
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,159
Now get this, he reads comic books!

908
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:45,839
Comic books! Barry Allen is The Flash!

909
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:48,079
Carl, slow down. I don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

910
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,999
He's a kid. Our unsub is a kid.

911
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:52,879
That's why we couldn't match his prints,
that's why he doesn't have a record.

912
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,959
I want you to contact NYPD for every

913
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,719
all-points juvenile runaways
in New York City.

914
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:01,079
Don't forget the airports. He's been
kiting checks all over the country.

915
01:05:01,161 --> 01:05:03,159
- Why New York?
- The Yankees!

916
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:05,599
He said something about the Yankees!

917
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:09,439
Where are we on the list?

918
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,959
Number 53, Abagnale.

919
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:17,559
Good morning, ma'am,
we're the F.B.I. agents who called.

920
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:18,720
Yes, I've been waiting.

921
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:22,239
I hope you're all hungry.
I put out the Sara Lee.

922
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:27,439
My husband, Jack, is a lawyer.

923
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,039
What about your first husband,
Mrs. Abagnale?

924
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:33,599
Abagnale. But I prefer
to be called Barnes.

925
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,480
Frank William Abagnale.
It says he was in the service.

926
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,559
Did you two meet during the war?

927
01:05:41,361 --> 01:05:45,159
Yeah, I lived in a very small village
in France, Montrichard.

928
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:48,919
The kind of place
where they never heard of Sara Lee.

929
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,800
Help yourselves.

930
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,639
Nobody doesn't like Sara Lee.

931
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,159
You filled out a missing person's report

932
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:57,559
for a runaway juvenile by the name of
Frank Abagnale Jr.

933
01:05:58,081 --> 01:05:59,279
Is Frankie okay?

934
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:01,679
You're aware of the fact that
he wrote some checks

935
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,879
on a closed account
at Chase Manhattan Bank?

936
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,280
Yes. The police think
he's some type of criminal.

937
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:09,719
What he did was a felony, Mrs. Barnes.

938
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,800
It was $1,000.

939
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:16,199
Half the kids his age are on dope,
throwing rocks at police.

940
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:20,959
And they scared me to death
because my son made a little mistake.

941
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:24,839
A 17-year-old boy has to eat,

942
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:26,880
has to have a place to sleep.

943
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:28,919
We understand, ma'am.

944
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:31,039
Would you happen to have a picture
of your son?

945
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,959
Yes, I have his old yearbook.

946
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,279
Okay.

947
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:48,079
We need to send out
an all-office teletype.

948
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:51,519
Our unsub's name
is Frank Abagnale Jr., age 17!

949
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,760
Is Frankie okay? Is he in trouble?

950
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:56,599
Ma'am, I'm sorry to have to tell you,
your son is forging checks.

951
01:06:56,680 --> 01:06:59,559
Forging checks? Wait!
I'm sure we can take care of that.

952
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,559
I'm working part-time at the church now.

953
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:04,040
Just tell me how much he owes
and I'll pay you back.

954
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:06,359
So far, it's about $1.3 million.

955
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:24,719
Hi, Melanie, how are you?

956
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,199
When you're in the house,
please use an ashtray.

957
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:28,959
Frank, this fondue is so good!

958
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:31,799
- Great. Take this.
- Good, I love Moët!

959
01:07:39,841 --> 01:07:43,839
James, please! Stay away
from the hi-fi system, all right?

960
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,719
It's a reel-to-reel,
you can't wind it like that.

961
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:52,559
Christ, Terry! This is Italian knit!

962
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:55,159
- Watch where you're going!
- It's just a shirt, man!

963
01:07:55,240 --> 01:07:57,159
Frank! Come quick!

964
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:00,919
Lance just fell into the conversation pit!

965
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:08,719
Excuse me,
you know where Lance Applebaum is?

966
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:09,880
Thank you.

967
01:08:10,841 --> 01:08:12,959
These bottles need to be
labeled when you pick them up!

968
01:08:13,041 --> 01:08:15,239
Do you understand
how dangerous this is? Do you?

969
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:18,439
Don't stand there crying. Nod your head.
Tell me you won't do it again.

970
01:08:18,521 --> 01:08:20,560
Now dry up and get back to work.

971
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:27,840
You okay?

972
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:31,159
He told me to pick up the blood, so I did.

973
01:08:31,240 --> 01:08:33,320
But he never told me to label it.

974
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,559
It's okay, stop crying.

975
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,319
What's your name?

976
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:40,479
Brenda.

977
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,079
Brenda, I wouldn't worry about it.

978
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:47,479
These doctors don't know everything.

979
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:49,920
It's my first week.

980
01:08:50,201 --> 01:08:51,959
I think they're going to fire me.

981
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:54,839
No, nobody's going to fire you, Brenda.

982
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,119
I bet you're good at your job.

983
01:08:58,200 --> 01:08:59,639
No, I'm not.

984
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,960
I bet if I asked you to check
on the status

985
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,679
of my friend Lance Applebaum,

986
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:08,079
you could do that for me in a second.

987
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:18,079
Mr. Applebaum fractured his ankle.

988
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:21,719
Dr. Ashland is treating him
in exam room seven.

989
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,159
You see that? No problem.

990
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:28,439
This is the emergency chart.

991
01:09:29,001 --> 01:09:32,720
See that blue star? That means
the patient has been diagnosed.

992
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:37,079
And then after he's been treated,
we put a red circle here. See?

993
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:40,559
How do you like those braces?

994
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,479
I guess they're all right.

995
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:46,199
I got mine off last year.

996
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,599
Boy, I hated them. They were bottoms.

997
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:51,920
I still got to wear my mouth guard.

998
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,520
You have really nice teeth.

999
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:57,879
Well, thank you.

1000
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:00,400
And you have a pretty smile.

1001
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:07,559
No, I mean it. I really think
those braces look good on you.

1002
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,119
Thank you.

1003
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,560
You're welcome.

1004
01:10:14,121 --> 01:10:15,080
Brenda.

1005
01:10:15,361 --> 01:10:16,519
Yeah.

1006
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:19,359
Do you know if they're hiring here
at the hospital?

1007
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,399
I'm not sure. What do you want to do?

1008
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:26,759
I'm a doctor.

1009
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,999
Dear Dad,

1010
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,679
I decided to get off the road for a while.

1011
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:38,519
I've taken a night job at a hospital
and met some really nice people.

1012
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,239
Feels good to have
my feet on the ground,

1013
01:10:40,321 --> 01:10:42,399
to wake up in the same bed every night.

1014
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:47,359
Who knows, maybe I'll even find
someone to settle down with.

1015
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:53,039
Harvard Medical School.
Top of your class.

1016
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:56,719
Southern California
Children's Hospital.

1017
01:10:57,201 --> 01:11:00,399
That is a pretty impressive résumé,
Dr. Conners.

1018
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:02,279
Unfortunately,

1019
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:09,880
the only thing I need is
an emergency room supervisor.

1020
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:13,279
Someone to babysit
six interns and 20 nurses.

1021
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:15,679
But...

1022
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:20,479
Hell, I doubt that you'd be interested
in that.

1023
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:26,239
In the past, they've always
let me choose my own nurses.

1024
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:28,959
Dr. Connelly.

1025
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:31,919
- Dr. Harris.
- Present.

1026
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,080
Dr. Ashland.

1027
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:35,519
Dr. Conners?

1028
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:38,079
You gonna take roll every night?

1029
01:11:38,160 --> 01:11:40,039
Yes, I will, Dr. Ashland.

1030
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:43,319
And if you're going to be late,
I suggest you bring a note.

1031
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:48,159
Miss Basmann.

1032
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,000
Miss Mace.

1033
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,079
Miss Strong.

1034
01:11:52,321 --> 01:11:53,359
Here.

1035
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:54,719
Nurse Brown.

1036
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,120
Nurse Sanford.

1037
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:59,959
Thirty milligrams
of codeine every four hours.

1038
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:03,719
Run the plasma at 60 drops a minute
till we calculate the fluid requirements.

1039
01:12:03,841 --> 01:12:07,239
What do you estimate the degree
and extent of the burns, Kildare?

1040
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:10,399
Second and third-degree burns
over about 20% of the body surface.

1041
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:13,840
- Do you concur?
- I concur. Let's get him up to Pediatrics.

1042
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,279
Hello, Brenda.

1043
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:22,719
Hi, Dr. Conners.

1044
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:25,839
- You need to sign these.
- Thank you.

1045
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:34,599
Do you notice anything different
about me?

1046
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:36,760
You got your braces off! Come here.

1047
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:39,239
I've been trying to show you all night!

1048
01:12:41,841 --> 01:12:43,119
Good job.

1049
01:12:43,201 --> 01:12:45,919
Did it hurt when they took them off?
Mine felt so weird after.

1050
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,799
I keep rubbing my tongue over them.
I can't stop!

1051
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,320
They're so slippery.

1052
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:53,439
- It feels good, doesn't it?
- Yeah, it feels incredible.

1053
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:04,559
Oh, my!

1054
01:13:05,841 --> 01:13:07,200
I'm sorry.

1055
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,719
Dr. Conners to the E.R.
Dr. Conners to the E.R.

1056
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:22,879
Shouldn't you go?

1057
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:27,399
No. They have a staff doctor
in the emergency ward, we'll be fine.

1058
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,279
What if he's in surgery?

1059
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,639
Do you really think I have to go?

1060
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,879
In here, Dr. Conners.

1061
01:13:57,320 --> 01:14:00,639
Gentlemen, what seems
to be the problem?

1062
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:05,679
Bicycle accident. A fractured tibia
about five inches below the patella.

1063
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:11,999
Dr. Harris.

1064
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,079
Do you concur?

1065
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:16,559
Concur with what, sir?

1066
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:20,239
With what Dr. Ashland just said.
Do you concur?

1067
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:25,119
Well, it was a bicycle accident.
The boy told us.

1068
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,399
So you concur?

1069
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,519
We should take an X-ray, stitch him up
and put him in a walking cast.

1070
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:38,039
Very good, Dr. Ashland. Very good.

1071
01:14:38,121 --> 01:14:40,959
Well, you don't seem
to have much need for me.

1072
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,240
Carry on.

1073
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:46,279
I blew it, didn't I?

1074
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:48,799
Why didn't I concur?

1075
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,559
Make yourself at home!

1076
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:14,279
Frank Abagnale Sr.

1077
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,079
You're not a cop.

1078
01:15:17,481 --> 01:15:19,680
Special Agent Hanratty, F.B.I.

1079
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:23,240
You're not a cop.
My landlord said you were not a cop.

1080
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:27,159
If you're going to arrest me,
I'd like to put on a different suit.

1081
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:29,439
- If that's okay...
- I'm not here to arrest you.

1082
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,719
I'm looking for your son. He's in trouble.

1083
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:33,439
Do you know where he is?

1084
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:38,999
If I tell you where he is,
will you promise not to tell his mother?

1085
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:40,120
Sure.

1086
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:45,200
Frank made up a fake I.D.
and enlisted in the Marine Corps.

1087
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,279
He's over in Vietnam right now.

1088
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,359
That kid is halfway around the world,

1089
01:15:49,441 --> 01:15:53,319
crawling through the damn jungle,
fighting the communists, so...

1090
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:58,559
Please, don't come to my home
and call my boy a criminal...

1091
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:02,399
I never said he was a criminal,
Mr. Abagnale. I said he was in trouble.

1092
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:07,000
If you'd like to give me a call and talk,
here's my number.

1093
01:16:18,921 --> 01:16:20,799
You're not a father, are you?

1094
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:23,879
Pardon me?

1095
01:16:24,001 --> 01:16:26,200
If you were a father, you'd know.

1096
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:31,519
I would never give up my son.
I would never give up my son.

1097
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:35,399
Yes, sir. I understand.

1098
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,079
Sean, now get this.

1099
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:43,039
Riverbend Apartments, 415 Landover,
Atlanta, Georgia.

1100
01:16:43,481 --> 01:16:45,079
Atlanta, Georgia.

1101
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:49,679
I'm on my way to the airport. I'll meet
the team in four hours. Bye-bye!

1102
01:16:51,841 --> 01:16:53,999
Come on, it's okay.

1103
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:56,479
You don't have to cry.

1104
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:01,040
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry, Frank!
I can't do this.

1105
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:02,719
Brenda, listen to me.

1106
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:05,719
I don't care if you're a virgin, all right?

1107
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:06,999
Really, I can wait.

1108
01:17:08,161 --> 01:17:09,800
I'm not a virgin.

1109
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:16,400
I had an abortion two years ago.

1110
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:22,239
My parents had a friend do it.

1111
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:25,799
A man that my father plays golf with.

1112
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:30,319
And when I got better,
they kicked me out of the house.

1113
01:17:31,201 --> 01:17:34,599
I had an abortion
and I wasn't their daughter anymore!

1114
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:38,239
I'm so sorry. Please don't be mad at me.

1115
01:17:39,841 --> 01:17:40,959
No, no.

1116
01:17:41,120 --> 01:17:43,199
Please don't be mad at me.

1117
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,520
What if I spoke to your parents?

1118
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:49,759
Maybe I can straighten things out.

1119
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:53,280
I ask them all the time,
but they said I still can't come home.

1120
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:57,120
And my daddy's a lawyer.

1121
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:06,279
Brenda?

1122
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:11,399
What if you were engaged to a doctor?

1123
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:13,840
Would that change anything?

1124
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:15,119
What?

1125
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:21,159
What if I went to your parents,

1126
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,799
and I spoke to your father

1127
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,440
and I asked permission to marry you?

1128
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:45,919
- It's empty.
- Nobody here.

1129
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:11,199
Dr. Conners, are you Lutheran?

1130
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:14,320
Yes, I am a Lutheran.

1131
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,479
But please, call me Frank.

1132
01:19:17,761 --> 01:19:20,319
Frank, would you like to say grace?

1133
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,839
Unless you're not comfortable.

1134
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:29,519
Absolutely.

1135
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,559
Two little mice fell
into a bucket of cream.

1136
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,319
The first mouse
quickly gave up and drowned,

1137
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,159
but the second mouse struggled so hard

1138
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:50,759
that he eventually churned
that cream into butter,

1139
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:52,919
and he walked out.

1140
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:55,359
Amen.

1141
01:19:58,081 --> 01:19:59,839
That was beautiful.

1142
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:02,399
The mouse churned
that cream into butter.

1143
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:06,599
That's right.

1144
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,239
Thank you.

1145
01:20:09,321 --> 01:20:12,319
Frank, have you decided which hospital
you want to work at in New Orleans?

1146
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:17,719
To be quite honest,
I'm thinking about getting back into law.

1147
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,120
Oh, my! Are you a doctor or a lawyer?

1148
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:25,199
Before I went to medical school,
I passed the bar in California.

1149
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:27,919
I practiced law for one year,
then I decided,

1150
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,599
why not try my hand at pediatrics?

1151
01:20:31,681 --> 01:20:33,799
You're just full of surprises.

1152
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:35,879
Yeah.

1153
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:40,079
A doctor and a lawyer.
Brenda hit the jackpot.

1154
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,439
Where did you go to law school?

1155
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,239
Berkeley.

1156
01:20:46,641 --> 01:20:48,519
Oh, my gosh.
Isn't that where you went, Daddy?

1157
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,200
Maybe Frank could come
work for you, Roger.

1158
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:53,399
You're always saying how hard it is
to find assistant prosecutors.

1159
01:20:53,481 --> 01:20:56,399
Could he, Daddy? Could he, please?
Could he come work with you, please?

1160
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:58,000
Was that snake Hollingsworth

1161
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,559
still teaching there
when you went through Berkeley?

1162
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,279
Hollingsworth.

1163
01:21:03,361 --> 01:21:05,599
Yes. Grumpy old Hollingsworth, right?

1164
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:07,359
Meaner than ever.

1165
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,639
And that dog of his?

1166
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:15,719
Tell me, Frank,
what was the name of his little dog?

1167
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,319
I'm sorry.

1168
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:29,560
The dog was dead.

1169
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:34,239
How unfortunate.

1170
01:21:35,601 --> 01:21:36,639
Yeah.

1171
01:22:05,761 --> 01:22:08,159
A doctor, a lawyer, a Lutheran.

1172
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,880
So, what are you, Frank?

1173
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:17,000
'Cause I think you're about to ask
for my daughter's hand in marriage,

1174
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:18,520
and I have a right to know.

1175
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:20,639
Know what, sir?

1176
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,559
The truth.

1177
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:26,600
Tell me the truth, Frank.

1178
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,919
What are you doing here?

1179
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:34,399
What is a man like you
doing with Brenda?

1180
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:39,239
If you want my blessing,
if you want my daughter,

1181
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:41,680
I'd like to hear it from you now.

1182
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:45,999
The truth is, sir...

1183
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,840
The truth is that...

1184
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:56,679
I'm not a doctor, I'm not a lawyer.

1185
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,160
I'm not an airline pilot.

1186
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,799
I'm nothing, really.

1187
01:23:11,721 --> 01:23:14,719
I'm just a kid
who's in love with your daughter.

1188
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:17,959
No.

1189
01:23:27,081 --> 01:23:28,959
You know what you are?

1190
01:23:29,281 --> 01:23:30,959
You're a romantic.

1191
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:33,959
Men like us are nothing
without the women we love.

1192
01:23:34,081 --> 01:23:37,520
I must confess,
I'm guilty of the same foolish whimsy.

1193
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,639
I proposed to Carol after five dates

1194
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:42,399
with two nickels in my pockets
and holes in my shoes

1195
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:44,319
because I knew she was the one.

1196
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:46,960
So go ahead, Frank.

1197
01:23:50,720 --> 01:23:52,320
Don't be afraid.

1198
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:55,359
Ask the question you came here
to ask me.

1199
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:03,679
What would I have to do to take the bar
here in New Orleans?

1200
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,319
No, the other question.

1201
01:24:15,361 --> 01:24:17,280
Right through that door.

1202
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:20,999
Good luck, Mr. Conners.

1203
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:22,799
Thank you.

1204
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:31,919
Hey, Frank.

1205
01:24:32,361 --> 01:24:34,599
You know what I could never figure out?

1206
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:37,399
How did you cheat on the bar exam
in Louisiana?

1207
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:39,039
What's the difference?

1208
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:42,959
- Someone took the test for you?
- I'm going to prison for a long time.

1209
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:45,800
Seriously, what's the difference?

1210
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:48,079
It's a simple question.

1211
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:51,519
Are you going to eat that éclair?

1212
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:55,680
Yeah. I'm saving it for later.

1213
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:58,599
Or you want to split it with me?

1214
01:24:58,720 --> 01:24:59,719
No.

1215
01:25:03,081 --> 01:25:05,599
Give me half that éclair and I'll tell you.

1216
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,479
I'm gonna figure it out sooner or later.

1217
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:28,239
You'll be working under Phillip Rigby
in corporate law.

1218
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,519
Why don't you settle in,
organize your desk?

1219
01:25:34,081 --> 01:25:36,000
We're having lunch at 12:30

1220
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:40,279
with the Attorney General
and Governor McKeithen himself.

1221
01:25:40,801 --> 01:25:41,919
A governor!

1222
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,559
Did we spell it right?

1223
01:25:43,681 --> 01:25:44,879
You sure did.

1224
01:25:45,201 --> 01:25:46,639
Congratulations.

1225
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,880
- Thank you, sir.
- Welcome aboard.

1226
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:58,559
Look at this photograph, Mr. Stewart.

1227
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:02,719
It's a photograph of Prentice York,
where they found him, dead.

1228
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,919
Here is an enlargement
of part of that photograph.

1229
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:09,759
This is a photograph of the defendant's
signature on a canceled check.

1230
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:13,599
Here is an enlargement of that
same signature, which matches

1231
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:16,720
the signature on the letters
that he wrote to Mrs. Simon,

1232
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:20,840
which discuss the possibility of
defrauding the great state of Louisiana.

1233
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:23,679
Your Honor,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

1234
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:27,879
this is irrefutable evidence
that the defendant is, in fact, lying.

1235
01:26:33,601 --> 01:26:37,399
Mr. Conners,
this is a preliminary hearing.

1236
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,639
There is no defendant.

1237
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:45,319
There is no jury.

1238
01:26:47,041 --> 01:26:48,239
It's just me.

1239
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:50,639
Son,

1240
01:26:50,881 --> 01:26:53,360
what in the hell is wrong with you?

1241
01:26:54,760 --> 01:26:56,959
Is that Mitch? Roger!

1242
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:58,960
It's Mitch!

1243
01:26:59,121 --> 01:27:00,880
I lost all track of time.

1244
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:03,199
As studio guests
for the sing-along tonight,

1245
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:04,279
we have the children's choir

1246
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:06,640
of Saint Monica's Church
in New York City.

1247
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:10,640
Won't you join them and the gang
in a few songs for the Irish? Everybody!

1248
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:38,839
Dad?

1249
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:44,720
What are you doing here?

1250
01:28:46,641 --> 01:28:48,319
I came to see you.

1251
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:54,160
What are you doing dressed like this?

1252
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:56,119
I took a government job.

1253
01:28:56,241 --> 01:28:59,479
You see what I'm doing?
Do you have a good lawyer?

1254
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:02,120
I sort of am a lawyer now.

1255
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:04,639
Look at this letter. The IRS wants more.

1256
01:29:05,561 --> 01:29:07,999
I had a deal with them. Two penalties.

1257
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:10,640
They ate the cake,
now they want the crumbs.

1258
01:29:11,321 --> 01:29:12,879
I want to sue them.

1259
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,999
Now they want the crumbs.

1260
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:18,879
Sit down.

1261
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:22,079
They're trying to scare me,
intimidate me. You know what?

1262
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:24,999
You know what?

1263
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:27,039
I'll make them chase me

1264
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:29,759
for the rest of their lives!

1265
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:38,439
It's great to see you, Daddy.

1266
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:42,519
Sit down, I want to show you something.

1267
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:47,039
I came here to give you this.

1268
01:29:47,121 --> 01:29:49,959
It's an invitation to an engagement party.

1269
01:29:52,601 --> 01:29:54,719
Daddy, I'm getting married.

1270
01:29:55,481 --> 01:29:57,599
Can you believe that
I'm getting married?

1271
01:29:57,681 --> 01:30:00,839
You don't need to worry
about anything now, Dad. Listen.

1272
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:04,400
I'm getting a brand-new Cadillac,
I'm getting a $60,000 house,

1273
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,119
I'm getting it all back.

1274
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:10,799
All the jewelry, the furs, everything
they took from us, I'll get it back.

1275
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:15,920
Has Ma seen you dressed like this?

1276
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:19,559
Yeah, she came to pick up some boxes.

1277
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:21,680
That's okay. You know why?

1278
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:24,000
Because she's going to the wedding
with us.

1279
01:30:24,120 --> 01:30:26,359
I'm gonna get you
a brand-new suit, Dad.

1280
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:29,200
One of those Manhattan Eagle,
three-button black pearl suits.

1281
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:30,320
You'll look great.

1282
01:30:30,400 --> 01:30:32,799
Those are nice. She won't see me.

1283
01:30:35,241 --> 01:30:37,359
Have you tried to call her?

1284
01:30:39,081 --> 01:30:43,679
Why don't you call her right now?

1285
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:45,400
Dad, just call her.

1286
01:30:45,480 --> 01:30:46,959
Call her for me.

1287
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:50,759
Tell her I have two first-class tickets
to go see her son's wedding...

1288
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:52,639
You mother's married now
to my friend, Jack Barnes.

1289
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:55,359
They have a house in Long Island.

1290
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:59,039
I had an F.B.I. agent come see me.

1291
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:03,399
You got their number, son.
The guy looked scared.

1292
01:31:03,921 --> 01:31:07,559
The United States Government, champ,
running for the hills.

1293
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:09,879
Pow! To the moon!

1294
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:21,839
Dad.

1295
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:24,319
It's over.

1296
01:31:25,441 --> 01:31:26,759
I'm going to stop now.

1297
01:31:29,800 --> 01:31:31,519
They're never gonna catch you, Frank.

1298
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:34,919
She wouldn't do that!
Why would she do that to you?

1299
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:37,879
Come on. Sit with me. Have a drink.
I'm your father.

1300
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:43,319
Then ask me to stop.
Then ask me to stop.

1301
01:31:46,520 --> 01:31:48,039
You can't stop.

1302
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:52,439
Where are you going?

1303
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:54,759
Come on, Frank, where are you going?

1304
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:57,359
Where are you going?
Where are you going tonight?

1305
01:31:57,681 --> 01:31:58,999
Someplace exotic?

1306
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:01,599
Where are you going tonight?
Tahiti? Hawaii?

1307
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:19,919
This is Hanratty.

1308
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:22,599
Hello, Carl.

1309
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:24,599
Merry Christmas.

1310
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:26,880
How are you, Dr. Conners?

1311
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:30,359
Carl, I haven't been Dr. Conners
for months now.

1312
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:34,799
Well,

1313
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:37,720
I'm sitting here in my office
on Christmas Eve.

1314
01:32:38,520 --> 01:32:40,079
What do you want?

1315
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:46,519
Okay.

1316
01:32:50,881 --> 01:32:52,679
I want it to be over.

1317
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:59,839
I want it to be over. I'm getting married.

1318
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:01,919
I'm settling down.

1319
01:33:02,001 --> 01:33:04,159
You've stolen almost $4 million.

1320
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:06,599
You think we could call it
a wedding present?

1321
01:33:06,680 --> 01:33:08,879
This isn't something
you get to walk away from, Frank.

1322
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:11,239
- I want to call a truce.
- No truce.

1323
01:33:11,321 --> 01:33:14,799
You will be caught, you will go to prison.
Where did you think this was going?

1324
01:33:15,320 --> 01:33:17,559
Please leave me alone, Carl.

1325
01:33:18,160 --> 01:33:19,359
Please?

1326
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:21,919
I'm getting close, aren't I?

1327
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,519
You're scared because
I'm getting close. I know

1328
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:28,639
you rented a car in Shreveport,
stayed in a hotel on Lake Charles.

1329
01:33:29,600 --> 01:33:31,399
You want to run, be my guest.

1330
01:33:31,481 --> 01:33:33,999
Your checks don't lie as well as you do.

1331
01:33:34,081 --> 01:33:35,679
Stop chasing me.

1332
01:33:38,720 --> 01:33:40,159
I can't stop.

1333
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:42,759
It's my job.

1334
01:33:43,961 --> 01:33:45,600
It's okay, Carl.

1335
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:49,639
I just thought I'd ask.

1336
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:52,839
Hey.

1337
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:55,480
Merry Christmas.

1338
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:00,400
I love my job.

1339
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:03,079
All right.

1340
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:06,559
Let's get every newspaper in Louisiana
for the last two months.

1341
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:08,039
What're we looking for?

1342
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:10,560
Engagement announcements.
Name of Conners.

1343
01:34:11,121 --> 01:34:14,000
Come on, the kid
would have changed his name by now.

1344
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:16,639
He can't change it.

1345
01:34:17,001 --> 01:34:18,599
She thinks he's Conners.

1346
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:21,079
If he loses the name, he loses the girl.

1347
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:33,399
- Congratulations!
- Having a good time?

1348
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:39,039
Keep dancing.

1349
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,359
Look who's here.

1350
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:46,999
I'm going to the little boys' room.

1351
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:48,919
Hurry back.

1352
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:06,559
Good evening.
I'm Agent Hanratty with the F.B.I.

1353
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,879
We'd like to have a few kind words
with your host, if possible.

1354
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:10,199
I'll get him.

1355
01:35:12,561 --> 01:35:14,399
Right over there, sir.

1356
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:18,399
Good evening, gentlemen.
I'm Roger Strong.

1357
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:21,839
Carl Hanratty, F.B.I.
These are Agents Amdursky and Fox.

1358
01:35:22,841 --> 01:35:26,239
- Sorry to crash your party, sir.
- Not at all. What can I do for you?

1359
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:29,560
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to meet the groom.

1360
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:31,359
Is there a problem?

1361
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:36,319
Frank! Can you hold all these?

1362
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:38,279
They're checks.
They're from my dad's friends.

1363
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:40,559
They're for us so
we can start our new life...

1364
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:43,120
What are you doing? What's wrong?

1365
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:44,920
We have to leave.

1366
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:49,079
You love me, right?

1367
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:51,519
I mean, you'd love me no matter what.

1368
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:55,359
You'd love me whether I was sick
or poor, or if I had a different name.

1369
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:56,840
Frank, where did you get
all that money?

1370
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:00,039
Brenda, listen. A name doesn't matter.

1371
01:36:00,120 --> 01:36:01,399
My name is Frank Conners.

1372
01:36:01,480 --> 01:36:03,999
That's who I am with you.
But we all have secrets.

1373
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:06,199
Sometimes when I travel,
I use the name Frank Taylor.

1374
01:36:06,280 --> 01:36:07,879
That's my secret.

1375
01:36:07,961 --> 01:36:11,679
Frank Taylor, you know.
Frank Black. It doesn't matter.

1376
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:13,799
Why are you saying all this?

1377
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:17,719
Brenda, I don't want to lie
to you anymore.

1378
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:20,039
I'm not a doctor,
I never went to medical school.

1379
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:23,279
I'm not a lawyer, or a Harvard graduate
or a Lutheran.

1380
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:26,959
I ran away from home
a year and a half ago when I was 16.

1381
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:30,919
Frank.

1382
01:36:32,241 --> 01:36:34,079
You're not a Lutheran?

1383
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:37,919
You see all this money? I have more.

1384
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:40,199
I have plenty more.

1385
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:44,479
I have enough money to last us
for the rest of our lives. Look.

1386
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:47,199
Frank, stop teasing me!

1387
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:50,839
You're Frank Conners
and you're 28 years old...

1388
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:54,720
Why would you lie to me?

1389
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:55,879
Brenda.

1390
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:58,799
I want to know your name.
Tell me your name.

1391
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:02,120
We can live anywhere we want.
But you have to trust me.

1392
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:04,919
Do you trust me?
Do you love me, Brenda?

1393
01:37:05,001 --> 01:37:06,399
Yes. I love you.

1394
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:08,599
Excuse me, Mother.

1395
01:37:09,200 --> 01:37:11,799
This is Mr. Hanratty. My wife, Carol.

1396
01:37:11,880 --> 01:37:13,759
- Mister...
- Hanratty, ma'am.

1397
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:15,799
Have you seen Frank or Brenda?

1398
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:17,760
I think they went upstairs.

1399
01:37:27,081 --> 01:37:28,199
Come here.

1400
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:32,319
In two days,
meet me at Miami International Airport.

1401
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:35,919
Leave the house after your parents
go to sleep. Take a taxicab.

1402
01:37:36,001 --> 01:37:39,479
Give the taxi driver this money.
Tell him to drive all through the night.

1403
01:37:39,561 --> 01:37:41,360
You're gonna leave at 10:00 a.m.

1404
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:42,839
10:00 a.m. All right?

1405
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:03,840
- Which room, sir?
- In the corner.

1406
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:08,319
You have to listen. The International
Terminal in Miami. Say it.

1407
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:12,399
No matter what, take a taxicab,
be there at 10:00 a.m.

1408
01:38:12,481 --> 01:38:14,199
I'll be there at 10:00 a.m.
no matter what.

1409
01:38:14,280 --> 01:38:16,720
In two days. Two days, Brenda.
Two days.

1410
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:19,559
In two days I'll be there,
no matter what, at 10:00 a.m.

1411
01:38:26,320 --> 01:38:29,039
We're not gonna tell anyone, Brenda.
You have to promise me now.

1412
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:34,039
Please! Before you go,
please tell me your name. Tell me.

1413
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:38,919
Frank William Abagnale Jr.

1414
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:47,479
Brenda.

1415
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:01,919
- This guy is a no-show.
- Maybe he was tipped.

1416
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:03,679
He's not here today, it'll be tomorrow.

1417
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:05,359
We'll get him before
he leaves the country.

1418
01:41:05,440 --> 01:41:07,159
He doesn't have a passport.

1419
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:09,199
For the last six months,
he's gone to Harvard and Berkeley.

1420
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:11,239
I'm betting he can get a passport.

1421
01:41:11,321 --> 01:41:13,559
Our men are waiting for him here
in Miami International.

1422
01:41:13,641 --> 01:41:15,199
He's used it before,
he knows the layout.

1423
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:18,599
The Miami police offered us
50 uniformed cops in two shifts of 25.

1424
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:20,959
With our guys,
that's almost 100 men in one airport.

1425
01:41:21,040 --> 01:41:22,439
Don't you think we should
spread it around?

1426
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:23,959
No, this is the exit point.

1427
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:25,519
How do you know he hasn't rented a car

1428
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:27,879
and driven to airports
in New York, Atlanta?

1429
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:30,879
Because I'm not in New York.
I'm not in Atlanta.

1430
01:41:31,160 --> 01:41:33,359
Yes. This is Frank Roberts.

1431
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:35,839
I'm letting all the universities
in the area know

1432
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:39,519
that Pan Am will be initiating
a new recruiting program this year.

1433
01:41:39,600 --> 01:41:42,720
I'll be stopping by
your campus tomorrow morning.

1434
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:45,320
Thank you all very much for coming.

1435
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:49,079
At the end of the day,
I'll be choosing eight young ladies

1436
01:41:49,161 --> 01:41:50,519
to be a part of.

1437
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:54,920
Pan Am's future stewardess
flight crew program.

1438
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,039
These eight young ladies
will accompany me on

1439
01:41:57,121 --> 01:41:59,879
a two-month public relations tour
through Europe

1440
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:03,519
where they will discover firsthand
what it takes

1441
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:05,559
to be a Pan American stewardess.

1442
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:12,399
Give me at least two men, no,
one man per every two counters.

1443
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:15,559
Amdursky?

1444
01:42:17,120 --> 01:42:21,039
Make sure your uniforms are covering
the sidewalks, entrances and exits.

1445
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:25,839
Let's have periodic sweeps
of the men's lav.

1446
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:30,359
What qualifies me
to be a future stewardess?

1447
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:35,159
Well, I think that I'm really friendly
and I can really help out

1448
01:42:35,241 --> 01:42:38,120
and make people feel welcome
on the plane and...

1449
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:40,320
We'll be traveling
at 6,000 miles per hour,

1450
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:42,279
at an altitude of 300 feet.

1451
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:44,599
All my bags are packed,

1452
01:42:45,401 --> 01:42:46,919
I'm ready to go.

1453
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:50,719
Ilene Anderson.

1454
01:42:58,600 --> 01:42:59,999
Miggy Acker.

1455
01:43:04,601 --> 01:43:06,279
Debra Jo McMillan.

1456
01:43:13,040 --> 01:43:14,399
Candy Heston.

1457
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:14,439
- Did you see that blonde out front?
- I should have been a pilot.

1458
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:15,479
Exactly.

1459
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:18,319
Mr. Hanratty,
pick up the courtesy telephone.

1460
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:19,399
Hanratty.

1461
01:44:19,481 --> 01:44:20,720
Your walkie-talkie
wasn't working.

1462
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:22,399
There's a guy in a Pan Am uniform

1463
01:44:22,480 --> 01:44:25,199
sitting in a white Coupe DeVille
in front of Terminal J.

1464
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:28,359
That's the charter terminal.
Did you get a look at his face?

1465
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:31,439
He's got his pilot's cap on.
Carl, I think it's him.

1466
01:44:43,120 --> 01:44:44,679
Out of the car, Frank.

1467
01:44:45,280 --> 01:44:46,439
Frank?

1468
01:44:46,641 --> 01:44:48,400
Step out of the car.

1469
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:50,519
Keep your hands where I can see them.

1470
01:44:50,601 --> 01:44:52,400
Don't shoot me. I'm just a driver.

1471
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:54,239
A man paid me $100
to wear this uniform

1472
01:44:54,321 --> 01:44:57,399
- to pick someone up at the airport.
- Who're you picking up?

1473
01:44:57,480 --> 01:44:58,560
Hey!

1474
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:25,079
South America, Australia,
Singapore, Egypt.

1475
01:45:25,161 --> 01:45:27,199
The kid's gone completely
out of control.

1476
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:29,519
- Why wasn't I called?
- Nobody was called, sir.

1477
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,319
The banks didn't know
what was happening until last week.

1478
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:32,399
That's impossible.

1479
01:45:32,480 --> 01:45:34,640
They didn't call because it's not
counterfeiting. It's something else.

1480
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:37,240
- What is he doing?
- He's making real checks, sir.

1481
01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:39,119
These are so perfect,
the airline didn't know the difference.

1482
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:40,999
Last check was cashed in Madrid
a week ago.

1483
01:45:41,081 --> 01:45:43,759
My guess is he's still there.
We've to leave now, sir. Today.

1484
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:46,399
For where? Spain?
You want to go to Spain?

1485
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:48,679
Eventually, he's gotta go back
to where the checks were printed.

1486
01:45:48,761 --> 01:45:50,079
I think that's why he's moving back
through Europe.

1487
01:45:50,160 --> 01:45:51,519
Look at the map, sir.
He's making a circle.

1488
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:53,239
He's running out of checks.

1489
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:57,599
It's a long shot, but if we could track him
from Madrid, we could still catch him.

1490
01:45:57,681 --> 01:46:00,560
I'm sorry, Carl. If you couldn't catch him
here, you're not gonna catch him there.

1491
01:46:00,640 --> 01:46:02,399
We're going to let him get away.

1492
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:05,799
No, Carl, you let him get away.

1493
01:46:45,960 --> 01:46:48,479
A perfect one-sixteenth

1494
01:46:48,840 --> 01:46:50,559
all the way around.

1495
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:54,959
Color separation is flawless.

1496
01:46:57,601 --> 01:46:59,079
There's no bleeding.

1497
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:01,799
Nobody does work like this
in the States.

1498
01:47:01,880 --> 01:47:03,279
Nobody but us.

1499
01:47:03,361 --> 01:47:05,000
Where was it printed?

1500
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:07,760
- It was printed on a monster.
- A monster.

1501
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:10,119
- A Heidelberg, an Istra.
- Heidelberg.

1502
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:13,399
A dinosaur, four colors,
you can smell the weight.

1503
01:47:13,641 --> 01:47:15,719
Two tons, without the ink.

1504
01:47:16,240 --> 01:47:18,559
Where do they do printing like this?

1505
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:20,199
Germany, Great Britain.

1506
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:21,479
France.

1507
01:47:23,801 --> 01:47:26,120
France. Frank's mother said the name
of a village in France,

1508
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:27,439
where they didn't have Sara Lee.

1509
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:29,159
The village where
she met Frank's father.

1510
01:47:29,240 --> 01:47:30,319
I don't remember.

1511
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:34,080
It started with an "M".
It was "Mont" something. Mr. Fox?

1512
01:47:34,160 --> 01:47:36,519
Yes. Question...
You met your husband during the war?

1513
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:38,519
Answer, I lived in a very small village
in France,

1514
01:47:38,601 --> 01:47:39,999
the kind of place
where they never heard of Sara Lee.

1515
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:42,919
Tell me you wrote down
the name of the village, Mr. Fox.

1516
01:47:44,440 --> 01:47:45,799
Montrichard.

1517
01:48:40,321 --> 01:48:41,439
Carl?

1518
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,599
Merry Christmas!

1519
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:48,560
How is it that we're always talking
on Christmas?

1520
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:50,759
Every Christmas, I'm talking to you!

1521
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:53,319
Put your shirt on, Frank.
You're under arrest.

1522
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:55,439
Are you hungry?
Do you want some beans?

1523
01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:57,359
Carl, they got
the best French beans here.

1524
01:48:57,440 --> 01:49:01,040
There's two dozen
French police officers outside.

1525
01:49:01,120 --> 01:49:02,479
They wanted to bring you in,

1526
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:04,799
but they needed the help
of an American.

1527
01:49:04,881 --> 01:49:06,319
But I told them
I wouldn't bring them to you,

1528
01:49:06,400 --> 01:49:08,319
unless I could put the cuffs
on you myself.

1529
01:49:08,441 --> 01:49:10,959
You have a gun? Do you have a gun?
No gun?

1530
01:49:11,041 --> 01:49:12,000
- No.
- No gun.

1531
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:15,959
And you're telling me what?

1532
01:49:17,120 --> 01:49:19,000
There's two dozen
French police officers

1533
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:20,519
out there right now on Christmas Eve?

1534
01:49:20,600 --> 01:49:22,719
- That's what you're telling me?
- Yeah.

1535
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:25,279
All right. There's no windows here.

1536
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:27,279
I'm going to take a look
out the front door.

1537
01:49:27,361 --> 01:49:28,320
No!

1538
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:32,239
I told them I'd walk out first
and give a signal. Put these on yourself.

1539
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:34,879
No, I can't do that! You know why?

1540
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:37,839
Because I think you're full of shit.

1541
01:49:37,921 --> 01:49:40,400
I don't think there's anyone else
out there.

1542
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:43,199
I think it's just me and you. That's right.

1543
01:49:43,281 --> 01:49:44,999
It's just me and you,
and you know what?

1544
01:49:45,640 --> 01:49:47,520
You're gonna have to catch me yourself.

1545
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:50,439
- We don't have time for this.
- That's good.

1546
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:53,639
Tell me what you want me to see.

1547
01:49:54,160 --> 01:49:57,680
- I wouldn't lie to you.
- You're wearing a wedding ring.

1548
01:49:57,760 --> 01:50:00,280
You lied to me about that!
Did you lie about that?

1549
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:04,039
You asked me if I had a family.
I did. But I don't anymore.

1550
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:16,119
Yes. No, there is no problem.
We're coming out right now.

1551
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:19,919
That was good.

1552
01:50:20,441 --> 01:50:22,480
Did you pay some hotel desk clerk
to make that call for you?

1553
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:23,559
Is that what you did?

1554
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:26,679
It was Captain Luc.
I've got one minute to bring you out.

1555
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:29,080
Captain Luc? Oh, Captain Luc! Well,

1556
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:32,879
that sounds pretty official to me,
but, like I said,

1557
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:36,760
I think it's just me and you here.
So you'll have to catch me.

1558
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:39,239
Frank, you have to trust me on this.

1559
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:42,319
These people have been embarrassed.
They're angry.

1560
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:44,759
You rob their banks, you steal
their money, you live in their country.

1561
01:50:44,841 --> 01:50:46,999
I told you this was
what was going to happen.

1562
01:50:47,080 --> 01:50:48,719
That there was no other way
for it to end.

1563
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:51,759
Don't make a mistake.

1564
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:54,119
That's good, Carl, you know?

1565
01:50:54,721 --> 01:50:57,359
Keep pushing that lie. Keep pushing it.

1566
01:50:57,440 --> 01:51:00,919
- Keep pushing till you make it true.
- They'll kill you.

1567
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:03,360
You walk out that door,
they're gonna kill you.

1568
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:10,080
Is that the truth?

1569
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:15,079
Yeah.

1570
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:22,079
Do you have any children, Carl?

1571
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:25,759
I have a 4-year-old daughter.

1572
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:28,799
Do you swear on your daughter?

1573
01:51:30,880 --> 01:51:32,798
You swear?

1574
01:52:09,321 --> 01:52:11,399
That was really good, Carl.

1575
01:52:18,801 --> 01:52:20,079
I have him in custody.

1576
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:23,519
I got him! It's all right.

1577
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:27,239
It's all right. I got him.

1578
01:52:30,800 --> 01:52:32,759
I want it on the record.

1579
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:36,919
Frank Abagnale surrendered
of his own accord. Understood?

1580
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:40,600
Where are you taking him?
I'm supposed to go.

1581
01:52:42,440 --> 01:52:44,919
Let me in the car!

1582
01:52:50,440 --> 01:52:54,040
Don't worry. I'll have you extradited back
to the United States.

1583
01:53:14,481 --> 01:53:15,519
Carl.

1584
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:22,639
You have to remember
to let me call my father when we land.

1585
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:27,279
I want to talk to him before he sees me
on television or something like that.

1586
01:53:37,160 --> 01:53:38,519
Carl, look.

1587
01:53:38,840 --> 01:53:40,759
That's LaGuardia right there.

1588
01:53:40,840 --> 01:53:42,160
Runway 44.

1589
01:53:42,280 --> 01:53:44,360
Frank, your father is dead.

1590
01:53:45,160 --> 01:53:46,479
I'm sorry.

1591
01:53:47,360 --> 01:53:50,999
I didn't want to say anything
until we got closer to home.

1592
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:53,039
He fell down some steps

1593
01:53:53,120 --> 01:53:56,239
at Grand Central Station
trying to catch a train.

1594
01:53:56,760 --> 01:53:58,719
I didn't want to be the one to tell you.

1595
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:01,439
You're lying, right?

1596
01:54:03,161 --> 01:54:05,360
You said I could talk to him.

1597
01:54:05,481 --> 01:54:08,159
Who are you to say something like that?

1598
01:54:09,040 --> 01:54:11,199
- You said I could talk to him.
- He fell

1599
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:13,679
and he broke his neck. I'm sorry.

1600
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:16,439
I'm really sorry.

1601
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:28,400
God damn it!

1602
01:54:30,321 --> 01:54:32,119
I'm going to be sick.

1603
01:54:32,520 --> 01:54:34,280
It's all right. It's okay.

1604
01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:37,840
- I'm going to be sick!
- Sure. Let's go to the bathroom.

1605
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:45,839
God damn it!

1606
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:05,919
Daddy.

1607
01:55:08,441 --> 01:55:09,639
You'll have to take your seat, sir.

1608
01:55:09,720 --> 01:55:12,199
I've told you twice.
We're landing. All of you.

1609
01:55:12,281 --> 01:55:13,999
Frank! Come on now.

1610
01:55:14,240 --> 01:55:16,999
We're landing in six minutes.
You need to be in your seats...

1611
01:55:17,081 --> 01:55:19,400
- Open the door!
- with seat belts fastened.

1612
01:55:19,720 --> 01:55:20,959
Frank!

1613
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:23,800
You do it.

1614
01:55:52,160 --> 01:55:53,319
Frank!

1615
01:55:59,041 --> 01:56:01,879
All right,
remain seated everyone, please.

1616
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:12,480
Please remain seated.

1617
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:16,720
God Almighty.

1618
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:06,039
What's your name?

1619
01:57:09,880 --> 01:57:11,199
Where's your mommy?

1620
01:57:35,480 --> 01:57:37,159
Sarge, we're good.

1621
01:57:46,841 --> 01:57:47,879
Hold up!

1622
01:57:51,361 --> 01:57:53,639
Put your hands behind your head!

1623
01:57:53,720 --> 01:57:54,839
Carl.

1624
01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:57,079
Get me in the car, please.

1625
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:01,039
Put him in.

1626
01:58:17,281 --> 01:58:20,479
Taking into account
the gravity of these crimes,

1627
01:58:20,640 --> 01:58:23,600
your history of bold
and elusive behavior

1628
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:27,679
and your complete lack of respect
for the laws of the United States,

1629
01:58:28,240 --> 01:58:32,479
I have no choice but to ignore
your request to be treated as a minor,

1630
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:37,440
and sentence you to 12 years
in Atlanta's maximum security prison

1631
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:41,519
and recommend strongly
that you be kept in isolation

1632
01:58:41,680 --> 01:58:44,119
for the entirety of that sentence.

1633
01:59:24,481 --> 01:59:26,039
Merry Christmas, Frank.

1634
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:31,039
I got you some comic books.

1635
01:59:37,680 --> 01:59:39,999
How's your daughter?
What was her name?

1636
01:59:40,360 --> 01:59:41,519
Grace.

1637
01:59:43,160 --> 01:59:46,160
I don't know. She lives with her mother
in Chicago, I don't get to see her much.

1638
01:59:48,160 --> 01:59:50,120
What's in the briefcase?

1639
01:59:51,081 --> 01:59:53,280
I'm on my way to the airport.

1640
01:59:53,561 --> 01:59:55,600
It's a paperhanger
working his way through Minnesota.

1641
01:59:57,640 --> 01:59:59,839
Jesus. He's driving us crazy.

1642
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:01,520
You got any of the checks?

1643
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:04,359
Yeah, I got a counterfeit he drew

1644
02:00:04,640 --> 02:00:06,799
in Great Lakes Savings and Loan.

1645
02:00:06,880 --> 02:00:09,799
He's using a stencil machine
and an Underwood.

1646
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:11,759
It's a teller at the bank.

1647
02:00:12,160 --> 02:00:13,399
Say again?

1648
02:00:13,480 --> 02:00:15,119
It's definitely a teller, Carl.

1649
02:00:15,200 --> 02:00:17,999
Banks always use hand stamps
for the dates.

1650
02:00:18,080 --> 02:00:21,120
They get used over and over again,
so they always get worn out.

1651
02:00:21,200 --> 02:00:24,599
And the numbers are always cracking.
The sixes and the nines,

1652
02:00:24,681 --> 02:00:26,399
see, they go first.

1653
02:00:28,720 --> 02:00:29,919
Thanks.

1654
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:38,479
I'd like you to take a look
at something for me.

1655
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:44,479
Tell me what you think.

1656
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:49,319
That's a fake.

1657
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:50,719
How do you know,
you haven't looked at it?

1658
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:52,839
There's no perforated edge, right?

1659
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:55,759
I mean, this check was hand-cut,
not fed.

1660
02:00:57,040 --> 02:00:58,199
Yeah.

1661
02:00:58,281 --> 02:01:01,919
Paper is double-bonded,
much too heavy to be a bank check.

1662
02:01:03,040 --> 02:01:06,839
Magnetic ink, it's raised against
my fingers instead of flat.

1663
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:12,639
And this doesn't smell like MICR,
it's some kind of a drafting ink.

1664
02:01:12,720 --> 02:01:15,399
The kind you get at a stationery store.

1665
02:01:20,480 --> 02:01:21,679
Frank,

1666
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:26,800
would you be interested in working
with the F.B.I.'s Financial Crimes Unit?

1667
02:01:27,120 --> 02:01:30,399
I already got a job here, you know.
I deliver the mail.

1668
02:01:32,841 --> 02:01:36,119
Frank, we have the power
to take you out of prison.

1669
02:01:37,241 --> 02:01:39,599
You'll be placed in the custody
of the F.B.I. where you'd serve out

1670
02:01:39,680 --> 02:01:40,719
the remainder of your sentence

1671
02:01:40,801 --> 02:01:42,279
as an employee
of the Federal Government.

1672
02:01:45,120 --> 02:01:46,879
Under whose custody?

1673
02:01:55,360 --> 02:01:56,519
Hi.

1674
02:01:56,640 --> 02:02:00,159
I'm Frank Abagnale.
I'm supposed to start work here today.

1675
02:02:00,240 --> 02:02:03,239
It's a tour company
operating out of the BVI.

1676
02:02:03,441 --> 02:02:05,039
Sir, Mr. Abagnale is here.

1677
02:02:05,120 --> 02:02:07,079
I'm gonna call you back.

1678
02:02:35,840 --> 02:02:38,439
- Hello, Carl.
- Welcome to the F.B.I.

1679
02:02:39,040 --> 02:02:41,479
I'll show you where you're working.

1680
02:02:50,080 --> 02:02:52,400
How long do I have to work here?

1681
02:02:52,521 --> 02:02:55,000
It's 8:15 in the morning
to 5:00 in the afternoon,

1682
02:02:55,080 --> 02:02:56,959
45 minutes for lunch.

1683
02:02:58,720 --> 02:03:00,399
No. I mean, how long?

1684
02:03:02,001 --> 02:03:03,360
Every day.

1685
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:05,999
Every day, Frank, till we let you go.

1686
02:03:57,681 --> 02:03:58,959
Hey, Carl.

1687
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:02,639
How are you doing?

1688
02:04:02,720 --> 02:04:06,399
It's not a good time, Frank.
I'm clearing my desk for the weekend.

1689
02:04:09,280 --> 02:04:11,879
You mind
if I come to work with you tomorrow?

1690
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:13,759
Tomorrow is Saturday.

1691
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:15,640
I'm flying to Chicago
to see my daughter.

1692
02:04:15,720 --> 02:04:17,000
I'll be back to work on Monday.

1693
02:04:17,120 --> 02:04:20,359
- You're going to see Grace?
- Yeah, that's the plan.

1694
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:25,839
What should I do till Monday?

1695
02:04:25,921 --> 02:04:29,119
I'm sorry, kid, I can't help you there.
Excuse me.

1696
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:36,839
This is Hanratty.

1697
02:04:37,520 --> 02:04:39,199
Yeah, put him on.

1698
02:04:47,041 --> 02:04:48,359
Mr. Sawyer.

1699
02:04:49,040 --> 02:04:50,439
How are you?

1700
02:04:50,720 --> 02:04:54,440
I have half a dozen more checks
on that tour operator at the BVI.

1701
02:05:33,121 --> 02:05:35,040
How did you do it, Frank?

1702
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:39,359
How did you pass the bar in Louisiana?

1703
02:05:39,441 --> 02:05:41,439
What are you doing here?

1704
02:05:42,080 --> 02:05:43,239
Listen.

1705
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:45,759
I'm sorry I put you through all this.

1706
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:48,519
You go back to Europe,
you'll die in Perpignan Prison.

1707
02:05:48,600 --> 02:05:49,519
You try to run here in the States,

1708
02:05:49,600 --> 02:05:52,799
we'll send you back to Atlanta
for 50 years.

1709
02:05:52,881 --> 02:05:54,279
I know that.

1710
02:05:55,881 --> 02:05:58,279
I spent four years
trying to arrange your release.

1711
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:00,119
I had to convince my bosses
at the F.B.I.

1712
02:06:00,200 --> 02:06:02,959
and the Attorney General
of the United States you wouldn't run.

1713
02:06:03,441 --> 02:06:05,119
Why did you do it?

1714
02:06:05,800 --> 02:06:08,399
- You're just a kid.
- I'm not your kid.

1715
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:11,079
You said you were going to Chicago.

1716
02:06:11,241 --> 02:06:14,879
My daughter can't see me this weekend.
She's going skiing.

1717
02:06:15,400 --> 02:06:17,599
You said she was four years old.
You're lying.

1718
02:06:17,680 --> 02:06:20,359
She was four when I left. Now she's 15.

1719
02:06:20,841 --> 02:06:23,600
My wife has been remarried
for 11 years.

1720
02:06:23,680 --> 02:06:25,999
I see Grace every now and again.

1721
02:06:26,720 --> 02:06:29,119
- I don't understand.
- Sure you do.

1722
02:06:29,920 --> 02:06:32,519
Sometimes it's easier living the lie.

1723
02:06:35,680 --> 02:06:37,919
I'm gonna let you fly tonight, Frank.

1724
02:06:38,720 --> 02:06:42,719
I won't even try to stop you, because
I know you'll be back on Monday.

1725
02:06:42,801 --> 02:06:43,919
Yeah.

1726
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:46,719
How do you know I'll come back?

1727
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:50,079
Look.

1728
02:06:51,080 --> 02:06:52,199
Frank.

1729
02:06:52,521 --> 02:06:54,399
Nobody is chasing you.

1730
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,319
Alice, has he still not called?

1731
02:07:16,401 --> 02:07:17,919
No, he hasn't.

1732
02:07:28,960 --> 02:07:30,199
Good morning.

1733
02:07:30,280 --> 02:07:32,239
I've called this meeting to discuss

1734
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:34,559
a new type of check fraud
and counterfeiting.

1735
02:07:34,641 --> 02:07:36,759
The unsub is washing
and altering checks,

1736
02:07:36,840 --> 02:07:38,359
then passing them throughout Arizona.

1737
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:46,840
This unsub is a big dog,
passing checks as large as five figures.

1738
02:07:50,121 --> 02:07:51,679
Sorry I'm late.

1739
02:07:52,920 --> 02:07:54,079
Sorry.

1740
02:07:58,120 --> 02:08:00,879
We have a recovered check
on Agent Reiter's desk.

1741
02:08:00,961 --> 02:08:03,560
Why don't we step out to the bullpen?

1742
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:10,239
There's impressions on every line.

1743
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:14,719
Looks like the original amount
was for $60.

1744
02:08:18,120 --> 02:08:19,959
Mind if I take a look?

1745
02:08:22,920 --> 02:08:25,240
Cashed in Flagstaff a week ago.

1746
02:08:27,880 --> 02:08:29,879
Cost the bank $16,000.

1747
02:08:31,480 --> 02:08:33,439
- It's a real check.
- Yeah.

1748
02:08:34,080 --> 02:08:37,359
It's been washed.
The only thing original is the signature.

1749
02:08:37,441 --> 02:08:39,080
But it's perfect.

1750
02:08:39,480 --> 02:08:42,279
I mean, this isn't hydrochloride
or bleach.

1751
02:08:42,440 --> 02:08:43,519
No.

1752
02:08:43,640 --> 02:08:45,120
Something new.

1753
02:08:45,280 --> 02:08:50,079
A nail polish remover where the acetone
removes the ink that's not been printed?

1754
02:08:53,081 --> 02:08:54,799
How did you do it, Frank?

1755
02:08:56,160 --> 02:08:59,199
How did you cheat on the bar exam
in Louisiana?

1756
02:09:04,160 --> 02:09:05,719
I didn't cheat.

1757
02:09:07,201 --> 02:09:09,800
I studied for two weeks and I passed.

1758
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:15,399
Is that the truth?

1759
02:09:15,480 --> 02:09:18,519
I'll bet this guy steals checks
out of mailboxes.

1760
02:09:18,600 --> 02:09:21,600
He washes off their names
and puts on his own.

1761
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,040
You're saying he's a local?

1762
02:09:25,120 --> 02:09:28,720
If it were me, I'd call the bank first.
Check out the balance...

1763
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:30,999
Make sure there's enough money
in there to make it worth your while.

1764
02:09:31,080 --> 02:09:32,160
Exactly.

1765
02:09:32,480 --> 02:09:35,359
You know, Carl, I think
this guy is pretty smart.

1766
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:38,119
Guess all we have to do now
is catch him.
