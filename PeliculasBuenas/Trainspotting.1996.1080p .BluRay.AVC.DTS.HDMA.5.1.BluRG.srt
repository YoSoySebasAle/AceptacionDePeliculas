Well, it really worked for him, eh?

84
00:05:36,611 --> 00:05:38,511
He's always been
lacking in moral fiber.

85
00:05:38,613 --> 00:05:39,973
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.

86
00:05:40,015 --> 00:05:42,210
That's hardly a substitute.

87
00:05:42,317 --> 00:05:44,148
You need one more hit.

88
00:05:44,252 --> 00:05:45,310
No, I don't think so.

89
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,650

<i>Paracetamol, mouthwash, vitamins,

00:06:54,256 --> 00:06:56,918
<i>One bottle of Valium, which

<i>but this was not the

115
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,886
Opium suppositories.

121
00:07:46,107 --> 00:07:47,904
Take it or leave it.

122
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,820
Are you feeling better now?

123
00:08:00,922 --> 00:08:02,765
For all the good they've done me,

124
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,301
I might as well have
stuck them up my arse.

125

<i>Heroin makes you constipated.</i>

126

00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:15,830
Ohh!

129
00:08:16,638 --> 00:08:18,765
<i>I'm no longer constipated.</i>

130
00:08:26,748 --> 00:08:30,184
<i>I fantasize about massive
pristine convenience.</i>

131
00:08:30,285 --> 00:08:33,846
<i>Brilliant gold taps,
virginal-white marble,</i>

132
00:08:33,955 --> 00:08:37,288
<i>a seat carved from ebony,
a cistern full of Chanel No. 5,</i>

<i>and a flunky handing me
pieces of raw silk toilet roll.</i>

134
00:08:41,696 --> 00:08:45,063
<i>But under the circumstances,
I'll settle for anywhere.</i>

135
00:08:57,045 --> 00:08:58,535
Ohh.

136
00:09:05,653 --> 00:09:07,177
Fuck.

137
00:09:07,288 --> 00:09:09,256
Ohh! Oh!

138
00:09:13,228 --> 00:09:14,228
Ahh.

139
00:10:39,147 --> 00:10:42,810
Yes, a fucking Godsend!

140
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,322
<i>And now.</i>

141
00:11:22,423 --> 00:11:24,118
<i>Now I'm ready.</i>

142
00:11:25,593 --> 00:11:28,424
<i>The downside of coming off
junk was I knew I would mix</i>

143

<i>with my friends in a state

144
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:32,430
<i>It was awful.</i>

145
00:11:32,534 --> 00:11:33,933
<i>They reminded me of myself.</i>

146
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:35,798
<i>I could hardly bear
to look at them.</i>

147
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,496
<i>Take Sick Boy, for instance.</i>

148
00:11:37,605 --> 00:11:39,300
<i>He came off junk at the same time.</i>

149
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,204
<i>Not because he wanted to.</i>

150
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:42,309
<i>Just to annoy me.</i>

151
00:11:42,377 --> 00:11:46,946
<i>Just to show me how easily he could do it,
thereby downgrading my own struggle.</i>

152
00:11:47,048 --> 00:11:49,073
<i>Sneaky fucker, don't you think?</i>

153
00:11:49,183 --> 00:11:52,277
<i>When I wanted to lie there
and feel sorry for myself,</i>

154
00:11:52,387 --> 00:11:56,223
<i>he insisted on telling me once again
about his unifying theory of life.</i>

155
00:11:56,324 --> 00:11:59,657
It's certainly a phenomenon
in all walks of life.

156
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,058
What do you mean?

157
00:12:02,196 --> 00:12:04,323
Well, at one point, you've got it.

158
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,992
Then you lose it,
and it's gone forever.

159
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,796
All walks of life.

160
00:12:09,637 --> 00:12:12,765
Georgie Best, for example,
had it, lost it.

161
00:12:12,874 --> 00:12:15,434
Or David Bowie, or Lou Reed.

162
00:12:15,543 --> 00:12:17,534
Lou Reed?
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.

163
00:12:17,645 --> 00:12:20,409
No, it's not bad, but it's not
great either, is it?

164
00:12:20,515 --> 00:12:21,982
In your heart, you kind of know

165
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:26,543
that although it sounds all
right, it's actually just shite.

166
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,223
So who else?

167
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:34,854
Charlie Nicholas, David Niven,
Malcolm McLaren, Elvis Presley.

168
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:38,490
Okay, okay, so what is the
point you're trying to make?

169
00:12:40,101 --> 00:12:43,195
All I am trying to do, Mark,
is to help you understand

170
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,171
that "The Name of the Rose"
is merely a blip

171
00:12:46,274 --> 00:12:49,334
on an otherwise uninterrupted
downward trajectory.

172
00:12:49,444 --> 00:12:51,708
And what about "The Untouchables"?

173
00:12:52,847 --> 00:12:54,439
I don't rate that at all.

174
00:12:54,549 --> 00:12:56,676
Despite the Academy Award?

175
00:12:57,385 --> 00:12:59,216
That means fuck all.

176
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,288
It's a sympathy vote.

177
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:06,690
So we all get old, we can't hack
it anymore, and that's it?

178
00:13:07,395 --> 00:13:08,726
Yeah.

179
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,764
That's your theory?

180
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:13,195
Yeah.

181
00:13:14,302 --> 00:13:16,634
Beautifully fucking illustrated.

182
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:19,936
Give me the gun.

183
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:22,202
Give me the gun.

184
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,945
Do you see the beast?

185
00:13:31,052 --> 00:13:33,350
Have you got it in your sights?

186
00:13:33,454 --> 00:13:35,922
Clear enough, Miss Moneypenny.

187
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:40,757
This should present
no significant problems.

188
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,101
Aah! No!
Fuck! Aah!

189
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:53,970
For a vegetarian, Rents,
you're a fucking evil shot.

190
00:13:54,642 --> 00:13:56,132
No! Get off!

191
00:13:56,577 --> 00:14:00,996
<i>Without heroin, I attempted to lead a useful
and fulfilling life as a good citizen.</i>

192
00:14:06,988 --> 00:14:08,546
- Good luck, Spud.
- Cheers, Cowboy.

193
00:14:08,656 --> 00:14:11,750
Remember, if they think you're
not trying, you're in trouble.

194
00:14:11,859 --> 00:14:13,724
First hint of that,
they'll be on to the DHSS.

195
00:14:13,828 --> 00:14:15,557
"This cunt is not trying."

196
00:14:15,663 --> 00:14:17,790
And your giro is
fucking finished, right?

197
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,389
But then again, try too hard...

198
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,297
You might get the fucking job.

199
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,258
Exactly.

200
00:14:22,303 --> 00:14:23,163
Nightmare.

201
00:14:23,204 --> 00:14:25,764
It's a tightrope, Spud.
It's a fucking tightrope.

202
00:14:25,873 --> 00:14:28,501
See, I just get pure shy
with the interviewer cats.

203
00:14:28,609 --> 00:14:30,873
I get all nervous.
I can't answer the questions.

204
00:14:30,978 --> 00:14:34,414
I'm a footballer, and I get
nerves on the big occasion, man.

205
00:14:34,515 --> 00:14:35,709
Try some of this, Spud.

206
00:14:35,817 --> 00:14:38,980
Yeah, a little dab of speed
is just the ticket, man.

207
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,586
No, I went to Craigy.
Craig Newton.

208
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,557
I just put down Royal Edinburgh
College to help get the job.

209
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,651
There's too much
discrimination in this town.

210
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:48,922
They're both schools, right?

211
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,588
We're all in this together.

212
00:14:50,698 --> 00:14:53,428
I want to put across the general
idea rather than the details.

213
00:14:53,534 --> 00:14:55,058
People get hung up on details.

214
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:57,501
Which school did I go to?
How many grades did I get?

215
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,334
It could be six.
Could be none.

216
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,668
It's not important.

217
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:03,869
What is important is that I am, yes?

218
00:15:03,978 --> 00:15:07,880
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that
you lied on your application?

219
00:15:07,982 --> 00:15:09,142
No!

220
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,310
Yes, only to get my
foot in the door.

221
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,717
Showing initiative and that.

222
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:15,914
You were referred by the
Department of Employment.

223
00:15:16,023 --> 00:15:20,517
There was no need for you to get your
"foot in the door," as you put it.

224
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,324
Cool. Whatever you say, man.
Sorry.

225
00:15:23,431 --> 00:15:25,296
You're the man,
the dude in the chair.

226
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:28,766
I am merely here.
But obviously I'm here.

227
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:33,139
Mr. Murphy, what exactly attracts
you to the leisure industry?

228
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:36,806
In a word, pleasure.

229
00:15:36,911 --> 00:15:39,209
Like, my pleasure
in other people's leisure.

230
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:42,714
Do you see yourself
as having any weaknesses?

231
00:15:44,886 --> 00:15:47,719
Oh, yes, 'cause I'm a bit
of a perfectionist, actually.

232
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:48,720
Yes, I am.

233
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,917
See, for me, it's got to be the
best, or it's nothing at all.

234
00:15:52,026 --> 00:15:54,722
Like, if things get a bit dodgy,
I cannot be bothered.

235
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:58,196
But I've got good vibes about
this interview thing today.

236
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:01,029
Seems to me like
it's going pretty well.

237
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,301
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

238
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:07,207
We'll let you know.

239
00:16:07,308 --> 00:16:08,366
The pleasure was mine.

240
00:16:08,476 --> 00:16:11,036
<i>Spud had done well.
I was proud of him.</i>

241
00:16:11,145 --> 00:16:15,081
<i>He fucked up good and proper.
You had to hand it to Spud.</i>

242
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:18,683
Picture the scene.

243
00:16:18,786 --> 00:16:21,311
The other fucking week,
doing the fucking volley.

244
00:16:21,422 --> 00:16:22,753
Me and Tommy playing pool.

245
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:25,121
I'm playing like
Paul fucking Newman by the way.

246
00:16:25,226 --> 00:16:28,127
Giving the boy here
the tanning of a lifetime.

247
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,422
So it comes to the last shot.

248
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,658
The deciding ball of
the whole tournament.

249
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:36,426
I'm on the black, and he's in the corner,
looking all fucking biscuit-arsed,

250
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,664
when this hard cunt comes in.

251
00:16:38,773 --> 00:16:41,503
Obviously fucking
fancied himself, like.

252
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:43,338
Starts staring at me.

253
00:16:43,444 --> 00:16:45,036
Looking at me, right fucking at me,

254
00:16:45,146 --> 00:16:47,808
as if to say,
"Come ahead, square, go."

255
00:16:47,915 --> 00:16:48,915
You know me.

256
00:16:49,016 --> 00:16:51,246
I'm not a type of cunt
that goes looking for bother.

257
00:16:51,352 --> 00:16:53,946
At the end of the day,
I'm the cunt with the pool cue,

258
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:57,513
and he can get the fire end
in his puss anytime he wanted.

259
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,651
So I squares up, casual like.

260
00:17:00,761 --> 00:17:04,697
What does the hard cunt do?
Or the so-called hard cunt?

261
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,027
Shites it.

262
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:10,001
Puts down his drink, turns,
and gets the fuck out of there.

263
00:17:10,104 --> 00:17:14,302
And after that,
well, the game was mine.

264
00:17:18,512 --> 00:17:19,877
<i>And that was it.</i>

265
00:17:19,981 --> 00:17:21,778
<i>That was Begbie's story.</i>

266
00:17:21,883 --> 00:17:24,249
<i>At least that was Begbie's
version of the story.</i>

267
00:17:24,352 --> 00:17:27,321
<i>But a couple of days later
I got the truth from Tommy.</i>

268
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,218
<i>You always got the truth from Tommy.</i>

269
00:17:29,323 --> 00:17:31,086
<i>It was one of his major weaknesses.</i>

270
00:17:31,192 --> 00:17:33,285
<i>He never told lies,
he never took drugs,</i>

271
00:17:33,394 --> 00:17:35,328
<i>and he never cheated on anyone.</i>

272
00:17:36,063 --> 00:17:37,462
It was Wednesday morning.

273
00:17:37,565 --> 00:17:39,465
We were in the volley playing pool.

274
00:17:39,567 --> 00:17:40,966
That much is true.

275
00:17:41,068 --> 00:17:45,198
But Begbie is playing
absolutely fucking gash.

276
00:17:45,306 --> 00:17:48,002
He's got a hangover so bad
he can hardly hold the cue,

277
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,576
never mind pot a ball.

278
00:17:49,677 --> 00:17:51,668
I'm doing my best to lose, you know.

279
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,543
Trying to humor him, like,
but it's not doing any good.

280
00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:57,243
Every time I touch a ball,
I seem to pot something.

281
00:17:57,351 --> 00:18:00,081
Every time Begbie goes
near the table, he fucks it up.

282
00:18:00,187 --> 00:18:02,678
Oh, fuck's sake.

283
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,760
So he's got the hump, right?

284
00:18:06,861 --> 00:18:10,228
But finally I manage to set
it up so all he has to do

285
00:18:10,331 --> 00:18:14,127
is to pot the black to win one game
to salvage a little bit of pride

286
00:18:14,235 --> 00:18:16,829
and maybe not kick
my head in, right?

287
00:18:16,938 --> 00:18:20,999
So he's on the black,
pressure shot.

288
00:18:23,411 --> 00:18:26,005
And it all goes wrong, big-time.

289
00:18:27,882 --> 00:18:28,882
Fuck!

290
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,676
Aah!

291
00:18:31,252 --> 00:18:33,550
He picks on this specky
wee gadgee at the bar

292
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,986
and accuses him of putting
him off by looking at him.

293
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,090
Can you believe it?

294
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,023
The cunt hasn't glanced
in our direction.

295
00:18:39,126 --> 00:18:40,218
Fuck off!

296
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,592
He was going to chib him,
I tell you.

297
00:18:42,697 --> 00:18:45,097
Then I thought
he was going to do me.

298
00:18:47,868 --> 00:18:50,632
The beggar's fucking psycho, man.

299
00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:55,336
But he's a mate, you know,
so what can you do?

300
00:18:55,443 --> 00:18:57,138
Can I borrow this?

301
00:18:57,244 --> 00:18:59,337
<i>What indeed could one do?</i>

302
00:18:59,447 --> 00:19:02,143
<i>Just stand back and watch
and try not to get involved.</i>

303
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,953
<i>Begbie didn't do drugs, either.
He just did people.</i>

304
00:19:07,054 --> 00:19:10,888
<i>That's what he got off on.
His own sensory addiction.</i>

305
00:19:13,094 --> 00:19:15,085
Nobody move!

306
00:19:16,397 --> 00:19:17,659
That lassie got glassed,

307
00:19:17,765 --> 00:19:20,928
and no cunt leaves here till
we find out what cunt did it.

308
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:22,559
Who the fuck are you?

309
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,900
Yes!

310
00:19:25,006 --> 00:19:26,735
Ohh!

311
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,617
Oh, Tom!
Oh, my God!

312
00:19:49,964 --> 00:19:51,397
Oh, Lizzy!

313
00:19:51,499 --> 00:19:52,523
Oh, Lizzy!

314
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:54,931
Oh, Tom, come in me!

315
00:19:55,036 --> 00:19:58,669
<i>And as I sat watching the intimate

00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,519
It's an interesting theory.

324
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,187
Actually, it's a nightmare.

325
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:58,765
I've been desperate for a shag,

326
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:02,097
but watching him suffer
was just too much fun.

327
00:21:02,203 --> 00:21:03,795
You should try it with Tommy.

328
00:21:03,904 --> 00:21:07,271
What, and deny myself the
only pleasure I get from him?

329
00:21:07,374 --> 00:21:08,898
Did I tell you about my birthday?

330
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:09,737
What happened?

331
00:21:09,844 --> 00:21:12,312
He forgot.
Useless motherfucker.

What are you talking about?

335
00:21:45,446 --> 00:21:46,845
Shopping.

360
00:23:41,562 --> 00:23:43,325
Excuse me,
I don't mean to harass you,

361
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:47,523
but I was very impressed with the capable
manner in which you dealt with that.

362
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:50,069
I was thinking to myself,
"This girl's special."

363
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,170
Thanks.

364
00:23:51,238 --> 00:23:53,138
- What's your name?
- Diane.

365
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,333
- Where are you going, Diane?
- I'm going home.

366
00:23:55,442 --> 00:23:57,171
- Where's that?
- It's where you live.

367
00:23:57,278 --> 00:23:58,278
Great.

368
00:23:58,312 --> 00:23:59,404
What?

369
00:23:59,513 --> 00:24:02,949
I'll come back with you,
but I'm not promising anything.

370
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,450
Do you find that this
approach usually works?

371
00:24:05,552 --> 00:24:08,020
Or, let me guess,
you've never tried it before.

372
00:24:08,122 --> 00:24:11,182
In fact, you don't normally
approach girls, am I right?

373
00:24:11,292 --> 00:24:14,193
The truth is that you're
a quiet, sensitive type,

374
00:24:14,295 --> 00:24:16,126
but if I'm prepared
to take a chance,

375
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,391
I might just get to
know the inner you.

376
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:22,902
Witty, adventurous,
passionate, loving, loyal.

377
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,903
Taxi!

378
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,405
A little bit crazy,
a little bit bad.

379
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:31,467
But, hey,
don't us girls just love that?

380
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,747
Well, what's wrong, boy?

381
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,316
Cat got your tongue?

382
00:24:37,418 --> 00:24:39,477
I left something.

383
00:24:40,454 --> 00:24:42,479
Are you getting in or not, pal?

384
00:25:03,644 --> 00:25:05,669
Do you understand?

385
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:09,044
I expect you to be a considerate
and thoughtful lover.

386
00:25:09,149 --> 00:25:11,174
Generous but firm.

387
00:25:11,285 --> 00:25:12,013
What?

388
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:15,452
Failure on your part to live up
to these reasonable expectations

389
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:20,152
will result in swift resumption
of a non-sex situation.

390
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,591
Right?

391
00:25:34,174 --> 00:25:35,436
Diane.

392
00:25:35,542 --> 00:25:36,600
Shh!

393
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,335
What?

394
00:25:37,444 --> 00:25:39,571
Shut up!

395
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,785
Wake up, Spud.

396
00:26:22,322 --> 00:26:23,914
Wake up.

397
00:26:24,024 --> 00:26:25,821
Sex.

398
00:26:27,094 --> 00:26:28,959
Casual sex.

399
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,966
Tommy, let's put the tape on.

400
00:26:39,072 --> 00:26:40,072
Now?

401
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,802
I want to watch ourselves
while we're screwing.

402
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,640
So let's see what I'm missing.

403
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:02,121
Not much.

404
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,461
Pushed forward again.

405
00:27:05,566 --> 00:27:07,500
And there's the captain,
Archie Gemmill,

406
00:27:07,601 --> 00:27:09,535
picking it up from the outside.

407
00:27:09,636 --> 00:27:11,069
I think he wants to go himself.

408
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,366
He's gonna go.
He's going all the way.

409
00:27:13,474 --> 00:27:14,839
And he scores!

410
00:27:14,942 --> 00:27:17,638
Oh, what a magnificent goal!

411
00:27:17,744 --> 00:27:19,837
Gemmill at his very best!

412
00:27:19,947 --> 00:27:23,041
What a penetrating goal that was!

413
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,811
I haven't felt that good

414
00:27:24,918 --> 00:27:28,319
since Archie Gemmill scored
against Holland in 1978.

415
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:33,592
You can't sleep here.

416
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,924
- What?
- Out.

417
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,223
Come on!

418
00:27:37,331 --> 00:27:40,027
No argument. You can sleep on
the sofa in the hall or go home.

419
00:27:40,133 --> 00:27:41,566
It's up to you.

420
00:27:42,903 --> 00:27:45,337
And don't make any noise.

421
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,935
Jesus!

422
00:27:54,481 --> 00:27:56,346
What do you mean, "It's gone"?

423
00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:00,147
- Where has it gone, Tommy?
- It'll be here somewhere!

424
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:03,952
I might have returned
it by mistake.

425
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,081
Returned it?

426
00:28:05,192 --> 00:28:09,026
Where?
The video shop, Tommy?

427
00:28:09,129 --> 00:28:11,723
The fucking video shop?

428
00:28:11,832 --> 00:28:16,201
So every punter in Edinburgh
is jerking off to our video?

429
00:28:16,803 --> 00:28:19,966
Oh, God, Tommy, I feel sick.

442
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:45,558
Aye.

443
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,688
You must be Mark.

444
00:29:48,795 --> 00:29:50,387
Aye, that's me.

445
00:29:55,936 --> 00:29:57,563
You're a friend of Diane's?

446
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,332
More of a friend of a friend, no?

447
00:29:59,439 --> 00:30:00,565
Right.

448
00:30:03,076 --> 00:30:05,135
Are you her flatmates, like?

449
00:30:06,813 --> 00:30:08,713
Flatmates?

450
00:30:08,815 --> 00:30:10,646
I must remember that one.

451
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:13,611
Morning.

452
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,127
Good morning, Spud.

453
00:30:30,237 --> 00:30:33,365
Gail.
Mr. Houston, Mrs. Houston.

454
00:30:33,473 --> 00:30:36,567
Good morning, Spud. Sit down
and have some breakfast.

455
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,076
I'm sorry about last night,
by the way.

456
00:30:41,181 --> 00:30:44,275
That's all right.
I slept fine on the sofa.

457
00:30:45,352 --> 00:30:49,220
I had a bit much to drink.
I had a bit of an accident.

458
00:30:49,322 --> 00:30:51,347
Don't worry, son.
These things happen.

459
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:54,723
It does a man good to cut
loose once in a while.

460
00:30:54,828 --> 00:30:57,729
This one could do with being
tied up once in a while.

461
00:30:57,831 --> 00:30:59,560
I'll put the sheets in the machine.

462
00:30:59,666 --> 00:31:01,725
No, no, no, I'll wash them.

463
00:31:01,835 --> 00:31:03,598
- There's no need.
- It's no problem.

464
00:31:03,704 --> 00:31:04,704
It's no problem for me.

465
00:31:04,805 --> 00:31:06,432
I'd rather take care of it myself.

466
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,734
Honestly, it's no problem.

467
00:31:07,841 --> 00:31:08,841
Really, no!

468
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:11,070
Spud, they're my sheets!

469
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:24,748
I don't see why not.

470
00:31:24,858 --> 00:31:26,553
Because it's illegal.
That's why not.

471
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,718
What? Holding hands?

472
00:31:27,828 --> 00:31:28,954
Not holding hands.

473
00:31:29,062 --> 00:31:30,620
In that case, you can do it.

474
00:31:30,731 --> 00:31:31,892
You were quite happy to do
a lot more last night.

475
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:33,109
You were quite happy to do
a lot more last night.

476
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:34,657
Yeah, and that's what's illegal.

477
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:36,328
Do you know what
they'd do to me inside?

478
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,836
They cut your balls off and
flush them down the toilet.

479
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:40,930
Calm down.
You're not going to jail.

480
00:31:41,041 --> 00:31:43,271
Well, that's very easy
for you to say, Diane.

481
00:31:43,376 --> 00:31:46,277
- Can I see you again?
- Certainly not!

482
00:31:46,379 --> 00:31:49,746
If you don't see me again,
I'll tell the police.

483
00:31:52,486 --> 00:31:54,545
I'll see you around then.

484
00:32:07,567 --> 00:32:09,159
Now what?

485
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:10,828
We're going for a walk.

486
00:32:10,937 --> 00:32:11,937
What?

487
00:32:12,038 --> 00:32:13,699
A walk!

488
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:15,641
Where?

489
00:32:15,742 --> 00:32:17,266
There!

490
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,806
Are you serious?

491
00:32:54,381 --> 00:32:56,611
Well, what are you waiting for?

492
00:32:57,117 --> 00:32:58,345
Tommy.

493
00:33:00,287 --> 00:33:02,187
This is not natural, man.

494
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:05,416
It's the great outdoors!

495
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,083
It's fresh air.

496
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:10,220
Look, Tommy, we know you're
getting a hard time off Lizzy,

497
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:13,197
but there's really no
need to take it out on us.

498
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,268
Doesn't it make you
proud to be Scottish?

499
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:18,201
It's shite being Scottish!

500
00:33:18,305 --> 00:33:20,432
We're the lowest of the low.

501
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,872
The scum of the fucking Earth.

502
00:33:22,976 --> 00:33:25,410
The most wretched,
miserable, servile,

503
00:33:25,512 --> 00:33:29,107
pathetic trash that was
ever shat into civilization.

504
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:31,116
Some people hate the English.
I don't.

505
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:32,879
They're just wankers.

506
00:33:32,986 --> 00:33:36,581
We, on the other hand,
are colonized by wankers.

507
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:40,717
We can't even find a decent
culture to be colonized by.

508
00:33:40,827 --> 00:33:43,591
We're ruled by effete arseholes.

509
00:33:43,697 --> 00:33:45,858
It's a shite state of
affairs to be in, Tommy,

510
00:33:45,966 --> 00:33:47,365
and all the fresh air in the world

511
00:33:47,467 --> 00:33:50,163
won't make any fucking difference!

512
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,008
Sorry, man.
I'm sorry.

513
00:34:01,114 --> 00:34:03,878
No, I appreciate it, Tommy.

514
00:34:03,984 --> 00:34:05,451
<i>At or around this time,</i>

515
00:34:05,552 --> 00:34:08,043
<i>Spud, Sick Boy, and I made
a healthy, informed,</i>

516
00:34:08,154 --> 00:34:11,817
<i>Democratic decision to get back
on heroin as soon as possible.</i>

517
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:14,086
<i>It took about 12 hours.</i>

518
00:34:18,732 --> 00:34:21,292
<i>It looks easy, this, but it's not.</i>

519
00:34:21,401 --> 00:34:24,199
<i>It looks like a doss,
like a soft option.</i>

520
00:34:24,304 --> 00:34:29,173
<i>But living like this,
it's a full-time business.</i>

521
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:50,323
Ursula Andress.

522
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:52,694
The quintessential Bond Girl.

523
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,858
That's what everyone says.

524
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:59,166
The embodiment, right,
of his superiority to us.

525
00:34:59,272 --> 00:35:02,673
Beautiful, exotic, highly sexual,

526
00:35:02,776 --> 00:35:08,009
yet totally unavailable
to anyone apart from him.

527
00:35:08,114 --> 00:35:09,240
Shite.

528
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:10,873
I mean, let's face it, mate.

529
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:12,747
She'd shag one punter
from Edinburgh,

530
00:35:12,852 --> 00:35:14,945
she'd shag the whole
fucking lot of us.

531
00:35:26,399 --> 00:35:27,832
Well done.

532
00:35:27,934 --> 00:35:31,028
I knew he was gonna do that.

533
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:41,974
Lizzy's gone, Mark.

534
00:35:42,082 --> 00:35:45,017
She's gone and fucking dumped me.

535
00:35:45,118 --> 00:35:48,212
It was that videotape

536
00:35:48,321 --> 00:35:49,913
and that Iggy Pop business

537
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:51,854
and other sorts of shit.

538
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:55,917
She told me where to go
and no fucking mistake.

539
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:57,997
I said to her,

540
00:35:58,098 --> 00:35:59,938
"Is there any chance
of getting back together?"

541
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,094
But no way, no fucking way.

542
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:08,732
Honor Blackman, A.K.A.
Pussy Galore, right?

543
00:36:08,842 --> 00:36:12,243
What a total fucking misnomer.

544
00:36:12,746 --> 00:36:16,079
I mean,
I wouldn't touch her with yours.

545
00:36:16,182 --> 00:36:18,446
I want to try it, Mark.

546
00:36:19,452 --> 00:36:22,285
You're always going on about
how it's the ultimate hit.

547
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:24,289
Better than sex.

548
00:36:27,994 --> 00:36:29,791
Come on, man, I'm a fucking adult.

549
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,387
I can find out for myself.

550
00:36:37,137 --> 00:36:38,627
I've got the money.

551
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:45,436
Personality. I mean,
that's what counts, right?

552
00:36:45,545 --> 00:36:46,443
Personality.

553
00:36:46,546 --> 00:36:50,141
That's what keeps a relationship
going through the years.

554
00:36:51,785 --> 00:36:53,548
Like heroin.

555
00:36:54,020 --> 00:37:00,050
I mean, heroin's got
great fucking personality.

<i>It had been days

00:39:06,286 --> 00:39:08,049
<i>Surely to fuck, someone must have.</i>

590
00:39:08,154 --> 00:39:10,816
- Allison! Allison!
- Help me, please!

591
00:39:10,924 --> 00:39:12,118
Calm down!

592
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:15,388
Everything's going to be just fine.

593
00:39:15,495 --> 00:39:18,293
<i>Nothing could have been

594
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:20,992
<i>In point of fact, nothing was

595
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,933
<i>On the contrary,
everything was going to be bad.</i>

596

<i>Bad?</i>

597
00:39:25,805 --> 00:39:29,366
<i>I mean everything was gonna be

598
00:39:37,317 --> 00:39:40,047
No!

599
00:39:46,993 --> 00:39:48,858

<i>I don't know.</i>

607
00:40:06,579 --> 00:40:09,377
<i>Maybe Allison knew.
Maybe not.</i>

608
00:40:09,482 --> 00:40:12,417
<i>I wished I could think of
something to say,</i>

609
00:40:12,518 --> 00:40:15,419
<i>something sympathetic,
something human.</i>

610
00:40:15,521 --> 00:40:17,716
Say something, Mark.

611
00:40:20,393 --> 00:40:23,658
Fucking say something!

612
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:31,497
I'm cooking up.

613
00:40:48,388 --> 00:40:50,686
Cook us up a shot, Rents.

614
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:53,281
I need a hit.

615
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,061
<i>And so she did.
I could understand that.</i>

616
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,427
<i>To take the pain away.</i>

617
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,467
<i>So I cooked up, and she got a hit.</i>

618
00:41:03,569 --> 00:41:05,537
<i>But only after me.</i>

619
00:41:05,638 --> 00:41:07,936
<i>That went without saying.</i>

620
00:41:09,709 --> 00:41:12,644
<i>Well, at least we knew
who the father was now.</i>

621
00:41:12,745 --> 00:41:15,111
<i>It wasn't just the baby
that died that day.</i>

622
00:41:15,214 --> 00:41:17,174
<i>Something inside Sick Boy
was lost and never returned.</i>

623
00:41:17,198 --> 00:41:19,194
<i>Something inside Sick Boy
was lost and never returned.</i>

624
00:41:19,218 --> 00:41:20,549
<i>It seemed he had no theory</i>

625
00:41:20,653 --> 00:41:22,746
<i>with which to explain
a moment like this.</i>

626
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,720
<i>Nor did I.</i>

627
00:41:24,824 --> 00:41:27,884
<i>Our only response was to keep
on going and fuck everything.</i>

628
00:41:27,994 --> 00:41:30,053
<i>Pile misery upon misery,</i>

629
00:41:30,163 --> 00:41:32,631
<i>heap it up on a spoon
and dissolve it with bile,</i>

630
00:41:32,732 --> 00:41:36,864
<i>then squirt it into a stinking,
purulent vein, and do it all over again.</i>

631
00:41:36,969 --> 00:41:40,729
<i>Keep on going, getting up, going out,
robbing, stealing, fucking people over,</i>

632
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,999
<i>propelling ourselves with longing towards
the day that it would all go wrong.</i>

633
00:41:45,111 --> 00:41:49,779
<i>Because no matter how much you stash or
how much you steal, you never have enough.</i>

634
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:52,578
<i>No matter how often you go out
and rob and fuck people over,</i>

635
00:41:52,685 --> 00:41:55,848
<i>you always need to get up
and do it all over again.</i>

636
00:41:59,158 --> 00:42:03,618
<i>Sooner or later, this kind
of thing was bound to happen.</i>

637
00:42:09,168 --> 00:42:11,693
Because shoplifting
is theft, which is a crime,

638
00:42:11,804 --> 00:42:13,396
and despite what you may believe,

639
00:42:13,506 --> 00:42:16,304
there is no such entity
as victimless crime.

640
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:19,908
Heroin addiction may explain your
actions, but it does not excuse them.

641
00:42:20,012 --> 00:42:24,283
Mr. Murphy, you are a habitual
thief, devoid of regret and remorse.

642
00:42:24,384 --> 00:42:26,443
In sentencing you
to six months imprisonment,

643
00:42:26,552 --> 00:42:30,010
my only worry is it will not
be long before we meet again.

644
00:42:30,123 --> 00:42:34,622
Mr. Renton, I understand that you have
entered into a program of rehabilitation

645
00:42:34,727 --> 00:42:37,821
in an attempt to wean yourself
away from heroin.

646
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,854
The suspension of your sentence

647
00:42:39,879 --> 00:42:43,913
is conditional on your continued
cooperation with this program.

648
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:45,938
Should you stand guilty
before me again,

649
00:42:46,038 --> 00:42:49,337
I shall not hesitate to impose
a custodial sentence.

650
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:51,672
Thank you, Your Honor.

651
00:42:51,778 --> 00:42:55,714
With God's help, I'll conquer
this terrible affliction.

652
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:11,920
<i>What can you say?</i>

653
00:43:12,031 --> 00:43:14,431
<i>Well, Begbie had a phrase for it.</i>

654
00:43:14,534 --> 00:43:17,162
It was obvious that cunt
was going to fuck some cunt.

655
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:19,636
Well, I hope you learnt
your lesson, son.

656
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:23,505
Oh, my son, I thought
I was gonna lose you there.

657
00:43:23,609 --> 00:43:28,171
You're nothing but trouble
to me, but I still love you!

658
00:43:28,281 --> 00:43:31,682
You better clean up your act.
Cut that shite out forever.

659
00:43:31,784 --> 00:43:33,979
You listen to Francis.
He's talking sense.

660
00:43:34,086 --> 00:43:35,178
Fucking right I am.

661
00:43:35,288 --> 00:43:38,280
See, inside, you wouldn't last
two fucking days.

662
00:43:38,391 --> 00:43:40,882
There's better things
than the needle, Rents.

663
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:41,891
Choose life.

664
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:44,019
I remember
when you were a wee baby.

665
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:46,098
Oh, mama's little baby loves.

668
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:06,147
I'm sorry, Mrs. Murphy.

669
00:44:06,252 --> 00:44:09,380
That wasn't any fair.
Spud going down and not me.

670
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:13,659
Well, it's not our fault!

671
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,393
Your boy went down
because he was a smack-head,

672
00:44:17,497 --> 00:44:20,796
and if that's not your fault,
then I don't know what is.

673
00:44:22,802 --> 00:44:25,896
That was that fucking cunt.

674
00:44:28,941 --> 00:44:30,067
I'll get the drinks.

675
00:44:30,176 --> 00:44:32,110
Aye.

676
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,446
<i>I wished I'd gone down
instead of Spud.</i>

677
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:40,542
<i>Here I was surrounded by my
family and my so-called mates,</i>

678
00:44:40,653 --> 00:44:44,282
<i>and I've never felt so alone,
never in all my puff.</i>

679
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:49,885
<i>Since I was on remand,
they've had me on this program.</i>

680
00:44:49,996 --> 00:44:52,123
<i>The state-sponsored addiction.</i>

681
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,858
<i>Three sickly sweet doses</i>

682
00:44:53,966 --> 00:44:56,264
<i>of methadone a day
instead of smack.</i>

683
00:44:56,369 --> 00:44:58,769
<i>But it's never enough.</i>

684
00:44:58,871 --> 00:45:01,806
<i>And at the moment,
it's nowhere near enough.</i>

685
00:45:02,642 --> 00:45:03,904
<i>I took all three this morning,</i>

686
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:06,570
<i>and now I've got 18 hours
to go till my next shot</i>

687
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:10,308
<i>and a sweat on my back
like a layer of frost.</i>

688
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:14,318
<i>I need to visit the Mother
Superior for one hit.</i>

689
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:20,359
<i>One fucking hit to get us
over this long, hard day.</i>

690
00:45:23,596 --> 00:45:25,188
What's on the menu
this evening, sir?

691
00:45:25,298 --> 00:45:28,131
- Your favorite dish.
- Excellent.

692
00:45:28,234 --> 00:45:30,794
- Usual table, sir?
- Oh, why, thank you.

693
00:45:30,903 --> 00:45:34,100
Would sir care to pay
for his bill in advance?

694
00:45:34,206 --> 00:45:35,798
No, stick it on my tab.

695
00:45:35,908 --> 00:45:37,102
Regret to inform, sir,

696
00:45:37,209 --> 00:45:40,303
credit limit was reached and
breached quite some time ago.

697
00:45:40,413 --> 00:45:42,745
Oh, well, in that case.

698
00:45:43,215 --> 00:45:45,410
Hard currency!
That'll do nicely.

699
00:45:45,518 --> 00:45:48,919
Can't be too careful when we're
dealing with your type, can we?

700
00:45:50,022 --> 00:45:52,957
Would sir care for a starter?
Some garlic bread perhaps?

701
00:45:53,059 --> 00:45:58,453
No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the
intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.

702
00:45:59,031 --> 00:46:00,760
As you wish, sir.

703
00:46:00,866 --> 00:46:03,266
As you wish.

Maybe I should go back
to the clinic.

754
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:05,791
No.

755
00:52:05,892 --> 00:52:09,123
No clinics, no methadone.

756
00:52:09,229 --> 00:52:12,357
That only made you worse.
You said so yourself.

757
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:18,369
You lied to us, son,
your own mother and father.

758
00:52:18,471 --> 00:52:21,463
- You could bring us jellies.
- No!

759
00:52:21,575 --> 00:52:23,236
You're worse coming off that
than heroin.

760
00:52:23,343 --> 00:52:25,811
- Nothing at all.
- It's a clean break this time.

761
00:52:25,912 --> 00:52:28,346
You're staying here where
we can keep an eye on you.

762
00:52:28,448 --> 00:52:30,075
I appreciate
what you're trying to do.

763
00:52:30,183 --> 00:52:32,674
But I just need one more score.

764
00:52:32,786 --> 00:52:35,880
Just bring me one more hit.

765
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:38,981
I need one more fucking hit!

766
00:52:40,293 --> 00:52:42,193
You fuck!

767
00:52:44,764 --> 00:52:46,629
Hit.

768
00:52:46,733 --> 00:52:48,462
Hit.

769
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:05,913
Well, this is a good
fucking laugh, ain't it?

770
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:08,487
You sweat that shite
out of your system,

771
00:53:08,588 --> 00:53:11,216
'cause if I come back
and it's still here,

772
00:53:11,324 --> 00:53:14,418
I'll fucking kick it out.

773
00:53:14,527 --> 00:53:16,188
Okay.

774
00:53:25,138 --> 00:53:26,571
God.

775
00:53:42,422 --> 00:53:44,049
Question number one.

776
00:53:44,157 --> 00:53:47,251
The human immunodeficiency virus
is a...

777
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,884
Retrovirus?

778
00:53:48,995 --> 00:53:51,486
Retrovirus is the right answer!

779
00:54:01,074 --> 00:54:04,339
It's a mug's
game, Mrs. Renton.

780
00:54:04,444 --> 00:54:07,311
I mean, I'm not saying
I was blameless myself.

781
00:54:07,414 --> 00:54:09,939
But there comes a time

782
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:12,041
when you have to turn your back
on that nonsense

783
00:54:12,152 --> 00:54:14,245
and just say no.

784
00:54:18,558 --> 00:54:20,788
Just say no.

785
00:54:20,894 --> 00:54:23,727
She's gone!
She's gone!

786
00:54:35,275 --> 00:54:36,742
Fuck.

787
00:54:52,092 --> 00:54:53,650
Question number two.

788
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:58,197
H.I.V. binds to which receptor
on the host lymphocyte?

789
00:54:58,298 --> 00:55:00,493
Which receptor is that?

790
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:04,036
<i>♪ I'm gonna try,
I'm gonna try ♪</i>

791
00:55:04,137 --> 00:55:07,231
<i>♪ I'm gonna try,
I'm gonna try ♪</i>

792
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:08,534
CD4.

793
00:55:08,641 --> 00:55:11,508
CD4 is the right answer!

794
00:55:15,081 --> 00:55:17,549
Better than sex, Rents.

795
00:55:17,650 --> 00:55:20,118
Better than sex.

796
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,450
The ultimate hit.

797
00:55:23,223 --> 00:55:26,488
I'm a fucking adult.
I can find out for myself.

798
00:55:27,494 --> 00:55:30,361
Well, I'm finding out, all right.

799
00:55:35,802 --> 00:55:37,827
Tommy.

800
00:55:39,672 --> 00:55:41,264
No!

801
00:55:41,374 --> 00:55:43,001
Stop it.
Fucking stop it.

802
00:55:43,109 --> 00:55:44,337
Stop it.
Stop it.

803
00:55:44,444 --> 00:55:48,073
Is he guilty or not guilty?

804
00:55:51,484 --> 00:55:53,384
He's our son.

805
00:55:59,826 --> 00:56:00,826
Don't!

806
00:56:00,894 --> 00:56:01,792
Don't!

807
00:56:01,895 --> 00:56:04,762
Don't!

808
00:56:04,864 --> 00:56:06,957
Stop!

809
00:56:07,901 --> 00:56:09,960
Oh, my God!

810
00:56:11,671 --> 00:56:13,104
Stop!

811
00:56:19,345 --> 00:56:22,246
Mark.

812
00:56:22,348 --> 00:56:23,474
Mark.

813
00:56:24,417 --> 00:56:26,009
Mark.

814
00:56:29,255 --> 00:56:31,621
There's something you need to do.

815
00:56:51,611 --> 00:56:52,611
Ow!

816
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,120
Come alive, 35.

817
00:57:03,223 --> 00:57:06,090
Lots of tricks, 66.

818
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,088
Mark, you've got a house!

819
00:57:10,196 --> 00:57:12,664
House!
House!

820
00:57:12,765 --> 00:57:15,233
For goodness sake, Mark.

821
00:57:15,835 --> 00:57:18,736
<i>It seems I really am
the luckiest guy in the world.</i>

822
00:57:18,838 --> 00:57:21,204
<i>Several years of addiction
in the middle of an epidemic,</i>

823
00:57:21,307 --> 00:57:23,571
<i>surrounded by the living dead.</i>

824
00:57:23,676 --> 00:57:26,304
<i>But not me.
I'm negative.</i>

825
00:57:26,412 --> 00:57:28,039
<i>It's official.</i>

826
00:57:28,915 --> 00:57:31,907
<i>Once the pain goes away,
the real battle starts.</i>

827
00:57:32,018 --> 00:57:33,918
<i>Depression.
Boredom.</i>

828
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:37,387
<i>You feel so fucking low, you'll
want to fucking top yourself.</i>

829
00:57:40,527 --> 00:57:42,392
Tommy!

830
00:57:42,495 --> 00:57:43,860
Tommy!

831
00:57:47,967 --> 00:57:50,527
Tommy, it's Mark, man.

832
00:57:58,645 --> 00:58:00,545
Renton.

833
00:58:23,002 --> 00:58:24,435
Getting out much, Tommy?

834
00:58:24,537 --> 00:58:26,129
No.

835
00:58:29,742 --> 00:58:31,710
Following the game at all?

836
00:58:31,811 --> 00:58:33,608
No.

837
00:58:35,148 --> 00:58:37,480
Nah, me neither, really.

838
00:58:47,794 --> 00:58:49,955
You take the test?

839
00:58:51,531 --> 00:58:53,396
Aye.

840
00:58:55,201 --> 00:58:57,169
Clear?

841
00:58:57,904 --> 00:58:59,394
Aye.

842
00:59:01,307 --> 00:59:03,468
That's nice.

843
00:59:05,945 --> 00:59:08,311
I'm sorry, Tommy.

844
00:59:10,617 --> 00:59:12,482
Got any gear on you?

845
00:59:13,653 --> 00:59:15,678
No, I'm clean, man.

846
00:59:16,623 --> 00:59:20,650
Well, sub us, then, mate.

847
00:59:21,794 --> 00:59:23,591
I'm expecting a rent check.

848
00:59:38,077 --> 00:59:39,601
Thanks, Mark.

849
00:59:40,213 --> 00:59:42,181
No bother.

850
00:59:46,085 --> 00:59:48,918
<i>No bother, none at all.</i>

851
00:59:49,022 --> 00:59:50,512
<i>Not for me, anyway.</i>

852
00:59:50,623 --> 00:59:52,591
<i>It's easy to be philosophical</i>

853
00:59:52,692 --> 00:59:55,752
<i>when it's some other poor cunt
with shite for blood.</i>

854
01:00:03,569 --> 01:00:05,264
What do you want?

855
01:00:05,371 --> 01:00:07,202
- Are you clean?
- Yes.

856
01:00:07,307 --> 01:00:08,968
Is that a promise, then?

857
01:00:09,075 --> 01:00:10,474
Yes, it is.

858
01:00:10,576 --> 01:00:13,545
Calm down.
I'm only asking.

859
01:00:17,016 --> 01:00:19,883
- Is that hash I can smell?
- No.

860
01:00:19,986 --> 01:00:21,647
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.

861
01:00:21,754 --> 01:00:24,188
- Well, it isn't.
- It smells like it.

862
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:28,056
- You're too young.
- I'm too young for what?

863
01:00:36,202 --> 01:00:38,466
You're not getting
any younger, Mark.

864
01:00:38,571 --> 01:00:41,199
The world's changing.
Music's changing.

Even drugs are changing.

866
01:00:42,975 --> 01:00:47,570
You can't stay in here all day
dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.

867
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,375
It's Iggy Pop.

868
01:00:49,482 --> 01:00:52,042
Whatever.
I mean, the guy's dead anyway.

869
01:00:52,151 --> 01:00:55,177
Iggy Pop is not dead.
He toured last year.

870
01:00:55,288 --> 01:00:58,883
The point is, you've got
to find something new.

<i>She was right.
I had to find something new.</i>

880
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:58,914
Ideally located in a quiet road,

<i>There was no such thing as

895
01:02:48,401 --> 01:02:51,461
<i>I most certainly had nothing

896
01:02:51,571 --> 01:02:55,371

1031
01:11:03,662 --> 01:11:06,222
He wanted to see Lizzy again.

1032
01:11:06,832 --> 01:11:08,891
She wouldn't let
him near the house.

1033
01:11:09,001 --> 01:11:12,630
So he bought her a present,
brought her this kitten.

1034
01:11:12,738 --> 01:11:14,638
I bet Lizzy told him
where to stick it.

1035
01:11:14,740 --> 01:11:17,800
Exactly. "I'm not wanting
that cat," she says.

1036
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:19,207
Get the fuck, right.

1037
01:11:19,311 --> 01:11:22,644
So there's Tommy stuck
with this kitten.

1038
01:11:22,748 --> 01:11:23,948
You can imagine what happened.

1039
01:11:23,983 --> 01:11:26,451
To those of us gathered here today,

1040
01:11:26,552 --> 01:11:30,750
Thomas McKenzie filled a number
of different roles in our lives.

1041
01:11:30,856 --> 01:11:32,414
- What?
- Thomas was a son.

1042
01:11:32,524 --> 01:11:34,082
The thing was neglected.

1043
01:11:34,193 --> 01:11:36,491
Pissing and shitting
all over the place.

1044
01:11:36,595 --> 01:11:41,164
Tommy's lying about fucked out of
his eyeballs on smack or downers.

1045
01:11:41,266 --> 01:11:44,702
He never knew you could get
toxoplasmosis from cat shit.

1046
01:11:45,771 --> 01:11:49,571
A loving man with a
great lust for life.

1047
01:11:50,409 --> 01:11:52,001
Neither did I.
What is it?

1048
01:11:52,111 --> 01:11:54,272
Fucking horrible.

1049
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:56,245
It's like an abscess in your brain.

1050
01:11:56,348 --> 01:11:58,179
Fucking hell.

1051
01:11:58,283 --> 01:11:59,409
Then what happened?

1052
01:11:59,518 --> 01:12:02,112
He starts getting these headaches,

1053
01:12:02,221 --> 01:12:05,452
so he just uses more smack,
you know, for the pain, like.

1054
01:12:05,557 --> 01:12:07,616
And then he has a stroke.

1055
01:12:07,726 --> 01:12:11,560
A fucking stroke.
Just like that.

1056
01:12:11,663 --> 01:12:14,655
Gets home from the hospital
and dies three weeks later.

1057
01:12:15,901 --> 01:12:17,232
He'd been dead for ages

1058
01:12:17,336 --> 01:12:19,463
before the neighbors
complained about the smell

1059
01:12:19,571 --> 01:12:22,472
and got the police
to break down the door.

1060
01:12:22,574 --> 01:12:24,906
Tommy was lying facedown
in a pool of vomit.

1061
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:26,637
He has gone from us,

1062
01:12:26,745 --> 01:12:30,146
but we have many things
to remember him by.

1063
01:12:30,249 --> 01:12:31,249
The kitten was fine.

1064
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:34,581
Would you all please rise
now for the committal?

1065
01:12:37,923 --> 01:12:42,986
<i>♪ Did you think
I would leave you crying ♪</i>

1066
01:12:43,095 --> 01:12:47,532
<i>♪ When there's room
on my horse for two? ♪</i>

1067
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:53,330
<i>♪ Climb up here, Tommy,
don't be dying ♪</i>

1068
01:12:53,439 --> 01:12:57,842
<i>♪ I can go just as fast with two ♪</i>

1069
01:12:57,943 --> 01:13:02,778
<i>♪ When we grow up,
we'll both be soldiers ♪</i>

1070
01:13:02,881 --> 01:13:07,614
<i>♪ And our horses will not be toys ♪</i>

1071
01:13:07,719 --> 01:13:12,713
<i>♪ And I wonder if we'll remember ♪</i>

1072
01:13:12,825 --> 01:13:17,319
<i>♪ When we were two little boys ♪</i>

1073
01:13:20,099 --> 01:13:22,226
- Tommy.
- Tommy.

1074
01:13:26,738 --> 01:13:28,706
Did you tell him yet?

1075
01:13:29,741 --> 01:13:30,799
On you go.

1076
01:13:30,909 --> 01:13:32,399
What?

1077
01:13:32,511 --> 01:13:34,138
There's this mate of Swanney's.

1078
01:13:34,246 --> 01:13:35,975
You know the guy.
Mikey Forrester.

1079
01:13:36,081 --> 01:13:37,309
Aye.

1080
01:13:37,783 --> 01:13:43,153
Well, he's come into some gear.

1081
01:13:43,255 --> 01:13:44,255
A lot of gear.

1082
01:13:44,356 --> 01:13:45,789
How much gear?

1083
01:13:47,593 --> 01:13:52,758
About two kilos, so he tells me.

1084
01:13:52,865 --> 01:13:55,993
He got drunk in a pub down
by the docks last week,

1085
01:13:56,101 --> 01:13:58,592
where he met two Russian sailors.

1086
01:13:58,704 --> 01:14:01,264
They're fucking carrying
this stuff for sale,

1087
01:14:01,373 --> 01:14:02,772
there and then, like.

1088
01:14:02,875 --> 01:14:06,276
So he wakes up the next morning,

1089
01:14:06,378 --> 01:14:10,109
realizes what he's done,
gets very fucking nervous.

1090
01:14:10,215 --> 01:14:11,807
He wants rid of this, right?

1091
01:14:11,917 --> 01:14:12,917
So?

1092
01:14:12,985 --> 01:14:16,785
So he met me,
and I offered to take it off his hands

1093
01:14:16,889 --> 01:14:19,551
at a very reasonable price,
with the intention

1094
01:14:19,658 --> 01:14:22,218
of punting it on myself
to a guy I know in London.

1095
01:14:22,327 --> 01:14:23,123
Ho ho-ho-ho!

1096
01:14:23,228 --> 01:14:27,798
We've just come back from Tommy's funeral
and you're talking about a scag deal?

1097
01:14:29,401 --> 01:14:30,800
Aye.

1098
01:14:34,573 --> 01:14:36,404
What was your price?

1099
01:14:36,508 --> 01:14:38,499
- Four grand.
- You haven't got four grand?

1100
01:14:38,610 --> 01:14:40,237
We're £2,000 short.

1101
01:14:40,345 --> 01:14:42,575
Well, that's tough.

1102
01:14:42,681 --> 01:14:46,583
Look, every cunt knows you've
been saving up down in London.

1103
01:14:46,685 --> 01:14:48,812
I'm sorry.
I do not have two grand.

1104
01:14:49,922 --> 01:14:51,856
Aye, you fucking do.

1105
01:14:53,358 --> 01:14:55,087
I've seen your bank statement.

1106
01:14:55,194 --> 01:14:57,492
For fuck's sake.

1107
01:14:57,596 --> 01:15:01,999
£2133.

1108
01:15:02,100 --> 01:15:05,365
Two kilos.
What is that, 10 years?

1109
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:07,199
Mikey Forrester?
Russian sailors?

1110
01:15:07,306 --> 01:15:09,399
What the fuck are you boys on, eh?

1111
01:15:09,508 --> 01:15:11,203
Spud, you've already been to jail.

1112
01:15:11,310 --> 01:15:13,778
What's the deal? You like it
so much you want to go back?

1113
01:15:13,879 --> 01:15:16,279
I just want the money, Mark.

1114
01:15:16,381 --> 01:15:18,281
If everybody keeps their mouth shut,

1115
01:15:18,383 --> 01:15:20,943
there'll be no cunt going to jail.

1116
01:15:25,490 --> 01:15:27,219
<i>There were a lot
of possibilities running</i>

1117
01:15:27,326 --> 01:15:29,954
<i>through my mind about
what might happen in London.</i>

1118
01:15:30,062 --> 01:15:33,293
<i>Things I didn't want to
talk to anyone about,</i>

1119
01:15:33,398 --> 01:15:36,458
<i>ideas best kept to myself.</i>

1120
01:15:36,568 --> 01:15:38,627
<i>No one told me
when we bought the scag,</i>

1121
01:15:38,737 --> 01:15:41,501
<i>some lucky punter
would have to try it out.</i>

1122
01:15:45,677 --> 01:15:47,304
<i>Begbie didn't trust Spud.</i>

1123
01:15:47,412 --> 01:15:49,812
<i>Sick Boy was too careful these days.</i>

1124
01:15:49,915 --> 01:15:53,078
<i>So I rolled up my sleeve,
I spiked my vein,</i>

1125
01:15:53,185 --> 01:15:54,914
<i>and I did what had to be done.</i>

1126
01:15:58,690 --> 01:16:00,590
It's good.

1127
01:16:00,692 --> 01:16:03,786
Oh, it's really fucking good.

1128
01:16:04,529 --> 01:16:07,828
Mmm. Ohh.

1129
01:16:07,933 --> 01:16:10,424
<i>Yeah, that hit was good.</i>

1130
01:16:10,535 --> 01:16:13,436
<i>I promised myself another one
before I got to London.</i>

1131
01:16:13,538 --> 01:16:16,939
<i>Just the one like.
For old time's sake.</i>

1132
01:16:17,042 --> 01:16:19,772
<i>Just to piss Begbie off.</i>

1133
01:16:19,878 --> 01:16:21,607
<i>This was his nightmare.</i>

1134
01:16:21,713 --> 01:16:24,443
<i>The dodgiest scam
in a lifetime of dodgy scams</i>

1135
01:16:24,549 --> 01:16:26,449
<i>being perpetrated with
three of the most useless</i>

1136
01:16:26,551 --> 01:16:30,112
<i>and unreliable fuck-ups in town.</i>

1137
01:16:30,222 --> 01:16:31,780
<i>I knew what was
going on in his mind.</i>

1138
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:34,381
<i>Any trouble in London, and
he would dump us immediately.</i>

1139
01:16:34,493 --> 01:16:35,493
<i>One way or another.</i>

1140
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:36,959
<i>He had to.</i>

1141
01:16:37,062 --> 01:16:39,292
<i>If he got caught
with a bagful of scag,</i>

1142
01:16:39,398 --> 01:16:40,888
<i>on top of that armed-robbery shit,</i>

1143
01:16:40,999 --> 01:16:43,593
<i>he was going down for 15 to 20.</i>

1144
01:16:44,002 --> 01:16:45,867
<i>Begbie was hard, but not so hard</i>

1145
01:16:45,971 --> 01:16:48,940
<i>that he didn't shite it
off 20 years in Sultan.</i>

1146
01:16:56,248 --> 01:16:58,808
<i>This was to be my final hit.</i>

1147
01:16:58,917 --> 01:17:00,748
<i>But let's be clear about this.</i>

1148
01:17:00,852 --> 01:17:03,912
<i>There's final hits and final hits.</i>

1149
01:17:04,022 --> 01:17:05,990
<i>What kind was this to be?</i>

1150
01:17:11,063 --> 01:17:12,860
Did you bring the cards?

1151
01:17:13,131 --> 01:17:14,462
- What?
- The cards.

1152
01:17:14,566 --> 01:17:17,126
The last thing I told you
was to mind the cards.

1153
01:17:17,235 --> 01:17:19,362
Well, I've not brought them.

1154
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:23,706
Fucking boring after a
while without the cards.

1155
01:17:23,809 --> 01:17:25,936
I'm sorry.

1156
01:17:26,044 --> 01:17:28,239
- Bit fucking late.
- Why didn't you bring them?

1157
01:17:28,347 --> 01:17:32,078
'Cause I fucking told you
to bring them, you doss cunt!

1158
01:17:32,884 --> 01:17:34,078
Christ.

1159
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:23,092
These are your friends, right?

1160
01:18:23,201 --> 01:18:26,261
These are the guys
I told you about.

1161
01:18:26,371 --> 01:18:28,771
- Well, is he here?
- Yeah, he's here.

1162
01:18:28,874 --> 01:18:30,774
You didn't get followed, did you?

1163
01:18:30,876 --> 01:18:32,935
We didn't get followed.

1164
01:18:33,044 --> 01:18:34,409
Okay.

1165
01:18:51,430 --> 01:18:52,624
All right.

1166
01:18:52,731 --> 01:18:53,891
Aye.

1167
01:18:56,568 --> 01:18:59,128
<i>Straightaway he clocked
us for what we were.</i>

1168
01:18:59,237 --> 01:19:02,229
<i>Small-time wasters
with an accidental big deal.</i>

1169
01:19:13,185 --> 01:19:14,880
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1170
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:12,870
So how much would
you like for this?

1171
01:20:15,347 --> 01:20:16,939
£20,000.

1172
01:20:18,617 --> 01:20:21,745
Well, I don't think it's worth
much more than £15,000.

1173
01:20:21,853 --> 01:20:23,650
<i>This was a real drag to him.</i>

1174
01:20:23,755 --> 01:20:25,655
<i>He didn't need to negotiate.</i>

1175
01:20:25,757 --> 01:20:27,987
<i>What the fuck were we going
to do if he didn't buy it?</i>

1176
01:20:28,093 --> 01:20:30,755
<i>Sell it on the streets?
Fuck that!</i>

1177
01:20:30,862 --> 01:20:32,659
Well, £19,000.

1178
01:20:32,764 --> 01:20:35,562
I'm terribly sorry.
I can't go to £19,000.

1179
01:20:38,203 --> 01:20:40,569
Well, fucking £16,000, then.

1180
01:20:42,607 --> 01:20:43,607
Okay.

1181
01:20:43,642 --> 01:20:46,236
Well, fucking £16,000 it is, then.

1182
01:20:50,615 --> 01:20:53,914
These, gentlemen,
are £2,000 bundles.

1183
01:20:54,019 --> 01:20:56,783
Here's two.

1184
01:20:56,888 --> 01:20:58,617
That's four.

1185
01:20:58,723 --> 01:21:01,123
<i>We settled on £16,000.</i>

1186
01:21:01,226 --> 01:21:04,992
<i>He had more in the suitcase,
but it was better than nothing.</i>

1187
01:21:12,070 --> 01:21:14,630
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

1188
01:21:14,739 --> 01:21:17,333
I'd like to say it's been
a pleasure haggling with you.

1189
01:21:17,442 --> 01:21:19,672
Fucking brand-new, by the way.

1190
01:21:22,147 --> 01:21:23,147
Okay.

1191
01:21:25,584 --> 01:21:27,643
- Yes!
- Yes!

1192
01:21:27,752 --> 01:21:29,151
Fucking...

1193
01:21:30,055 --> 01:21:32,819
<i>And just for a moment,
it felt really great.</i>

1194
01:21:32,924 --> 01:21:34,824
<i>Like we were in it together,
like friends.</i>

1195
01:21:34,926 --> 01:21:36,416
<i>Like it meant something.</i>

1196
01:21:36,528 --> 01:21:38,996
<i>A moment like that
can touch you deep inside.</i>

1197
01:21:39,097 --> 01:21:40,608
<i>But it doesn't last long,
not like £16,000.</i>

1198
01:21:40,632 --> 01:21:42,176
<i>But it doesn't last long,
not like £16,000.</i>

1199
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:45,328
So what about you, Spud, any
investments on the horizon?

1200
01:21:45,437 --> 01:21:47,667
Gonna buy yourself
a wee island in the sun?

1201
01:21:47,772 --> 01:21:48,796
For four fucking grand?

1202
01:21:48,907 --> 01:21:52,968
One palm tree, a couple
of rocks, and a sewage outflow.

1203
01:21:53,878 --> 01:21:56,176
I don't know, man.

1204
01:21:56,281 --> 01:21:58,749
I'm gonna get something for my ma.

1205
01:21:58,850 --> 01:22:03,048
Get some good speed, no bicarb.

1206
01:22:03,154 --> 01:22:05,179
And get a girl, take her out,
treat her right.

1207
01:22:05,290 --> 01:22:06,290
Shag her senseless.

1208
01:22:06,391 --> 01:22:08,450
No, man!
True love.

1209
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:09,959
True love.

1210
01:22:10,061 --> 01:22:11,460
Hey, but I could handle

1211
01:22:11,563 --> 01:22:14,464
some hot sex with a Jewish Princess.

1212
01:22:14,566 --> 01:22:16,625
- You daft cunt!
- Or a Catholic!

1213
01:22:16,735 --> 01:22:17,778
If you're gonna waste it on a bird,

1214
01:22:17,802 --> 01:22:20,293
you may as well fucking
leave all of it to me.

1215
01:22:20,405 --> 01:22:21,804
Now get the drinks.

1216
01:22:21,906 --> 01:22:25,034
- I got the last one.
- It's your round, Franco.

1217
01:22:26,578 --> 01:22:28,546
Okay.
Same again?

1218
01:22:28,647 --> 01:22:31,081
Right.
I'm off for a pish.

1219
01:22:31,182 --> 01:22:33,742
See when I get back
the money's still here, okay?

1220
01:22:33,852 --> 01:22:35,763
The moment your back's turned,
we're out the door.

1221
01:22:35,787 --> 01:22:37,379
I'll be right fucking after you.

1222
01:22:37,489 --> 01:22:40,151
You'll never catch us,
you flabby bastard.

1223
01:22:40,258 --> 01:22:42,522
By the way, see when I get back.

1224
01:22:42,627 --> 01:22:45,152
Be halfway down
the street with the money.

1225
01:22:45,263 --> 01:22:46,662
Fucking kill you.

1226
01:22:46,765 --> 01:22:48,995
I thought you might, Franco.

1227
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:50,624
I thought you might.

1228
01:22:55,106 --> 01:22:57,336
Are you game for it?

1229
01:22:57,442 --> 01:22:58,966
What?

1230
01:23:00,645 --> 01:23:02,112
Well?

1231
01:23:03,214 --> 01:23:04,806
Are you serious?

1232
01:23:12,824 --> 01:23:13,824
Don't know.

1233
01:23:13,892 --> 01:23:15,382
What do you think?

1234
01:23:16,728 --> 01:23:17,888
Still here, I see.

1235
01:23:17,996 --> 01:23:20,396
Oh, well, we wouldn't
run out on a mate, eh?

1236
01:23:20,498 --> 01:23:22,830
Why not?
I know I would.

1237
01:23:23,702 --> 01:23:25,397
Where's Franco?

1238
01:23:27,972 --> 01:23:30,463
For fuck's sake!

1239
01:23:30,575 --> 01:23:31,769
Sorry, mate.

1240
01:23:31,876 --> 01:23:35,175
You ruined my fucking suit,
you fucking idiot.

1241
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:36,747
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

1242
01:23:36,848 --> 01:23:38,907
Sorry's not gonna
dry me off, you cunt.

1243
01:23:39,017 --> 01:23:41,986
Cool down, Franco.
The man says he's sorry.

1244
01:23:42,087 --> 01:23:45,318
Not sorry enough
for being a fat cunt.

1245
01:23:45,423 --> 01:23:47,550
If you can't hold a pint,
you shouldn't be in the pub.

1246
01:23:47,659 --> 01:23:48,683
Fuck off.

1247
01:23:53,064 --> 01:23:54,793
Aah.

1248
01:23:54,899 --> 01:23:57,299
Oh! Oh, no!
Oh, no!

1249
01:24:04,642 --> 01:24:06,701
Come on, Franco, move away.
Aah!

1250
01:24:06,811 --> 01:24:09,177
Aah!
Fuck's sake!

1251
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:11,771
Oh, fucking nice one, Franco!

1252
01:24:11,883 --> 01:24:13,544
- Shut it!
- You cut me, man!

1253
01:24:13,651 --> 01:24:15,744
You were in my fucking way.

1254
01:24:15,854 --> 01:24:17,151
Help!

1255
01:24:18,323 --> 01:24:19,654
Oh, no.

1256
01:24:19,758 --> 01:24:22,989
Anybody else want to get
in my fucking way?

1257
01:24:23,094 --> 01:24:24,322
You?

1258
01:24:26,731 --> 01:24:27,857
You?

1259
01:24:32,837 --> 01:24:38,241
Hey, Rent Boy, you bring
me down a fucking smoke.

1260
01:24:38,343 --> 01:24:41,312
- I think we'd better go, Franco!
- Go to the hospital!

1261
01:24:41,412 --> 01:24:45,178
You're not going to any fucking
hospital, and you're staying.

1262
01:24:48,186 --> 01:24:51,314
You bring me down
a fucking cigarette.

1263
01:24:57,095 --> 01:24:58,687

1323
01:29:39,677 --> 01:29:41,508
