1
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,957
Now you take it easy, slugger.

2
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:26,800
Joey!

3
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,020
Joe Doyle!

4
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,197
All right! What do you want?

5
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,820
I got one of your birds.

6
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,484
I recognized him by the band.

7
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,700
It must be Danny-boy.
I lost him in the last race.

8
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,042
He flew into my coop.

9
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:52,295
- You want him?
- I got to watch myself these days.

10
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:54,204
You know what I mean?

11
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,415
Don't worry.

12
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:59,507
- I'll take him up to your loft.
- Okay, I'll see you on the roof.

13
00:03:24,582 --> 00:03:25,781
How goes?

14
00:03:26,835 --> 00:03:28,163
He's up on the roof.

15
00:03:28,253 --> 00:03:29,416
The pigeon?

16
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:31,667
Yeah, it worked.

17
00:03:36,846 --> 00:03:39,004
I think somebody fell off the roof.

18
00:03:45,522 --> 00:03:48,973
He thought he'd sing
to the Crime Commission. He won't.

19
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,859
I thought they'd talk to him.

20
00:03:50,944 --> 00:03:52,189
That's the idea.

21
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:55,031
I thought they'd talk to him
and get him to dummy up.

22
00:03:55,115 --> 00:03:56,823
Maybe he gave them an argument.

23
00:03:56,909 --> 00:04:00,492
I figured the worst they was gonna do
was lean on him a little bit.

24
00:04:00,579 --> 00:04:02,323
Maybe he gave them an argument.

25
00:04:02,415 --> 00:04:05,914
He's been giving Johnny the Boss
a lot of arguments lately.

26
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:09,170
He wasn't a bad kid, that Joey.

27
00:04:09,255 --> 00:04:10,418
A canary.

28
00:04:10,507 --> 00:04:13,045
Maybe he could sing, but he couldn't fly.

29
00:04:19,308 --> 00:04:21,633
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

30
00:04:24,605 --> 00:04:26,728
I'll be in there later and...

31
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,488
Father Barry is here.

32
00:04:42,374 --> 00:04:44,830
Same thing happened to my Andy
five years ago.

33
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:47,161
- You're the boy's father?
- That's right.

34
00:04:47,255 --> 00:04:50,007
Looks like he fell off the roof,
or maybe he was pushed.

35
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:51,254
- Any ideas?
- No.

36
00:04:51,342 --> 00:04:55,292
He was the only longshoreman that had the
guts to talk to the crime investigators.

37
00:04:55,388 --> 00:04:57,215
- Who asked you?
- Everybody knows that.

38
00:04:57,307 --> 00:04:58,054
Shut up.

39
00:04:58,141 --> 00:05:01,226
- If he took my advice he wouldn't be...
- Everyone knows that.

40
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,343
I said, "Shut up!"

41
00:05:02,438 --> 00:05:05,225
I know how you feel about cops,
but if you give me...

42
00:05:05,316 --> 00:05:06,727
some leads I could...

43
00:05:06,817 --> 00:05:08,940
I kept telling him, "Don't say nothing.

44
00:05:09,028 --> 00:05:11,021
"Keep quiet, you'll live longer."

45
00:05:12,365 --> 00:05:16,280
I've been on the docks all my life,
boy, and there's one thing I learned.

46
00:05:16,369 --> 00:05:19,620
You don't ask no questions,
you don't answer no questions...

47
00:05:19,706 --> 00:05:22,197
unless you want to wind up like that.

48
00:05:25,546 --> 00:05:27,704
Edie, come here.

49
00:05:28,716 --> 00:05:30,341
I want to talk to you.

50
00:05:31,969 --> 00:05:34,211
Father, who'd want to kill Joey?

51
00:05:37,726 --> 00:05:40,217
Stay away from him! Stay away from him!

52
00:05:40,645 --> 00:05:42,140
Edie, listen!

53
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,354
Remember time and faith are great healers.

54
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:47,478
Father, my brother is dead
and you talk about time and faith.

55
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:51,105
My brother was the best kid in the
neighborhood and everybody said so.

56
00:05:51,198 --> 00:05:53,524
I'm in the church if you need me.

57
00:05:54,869 --> 00:05:56,696
You're in the church if I need you?

58
00:05:56,788 --> 00:05:59,623
Did you ever hear of a saint
hiding in a church?

59
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:03,540
I want to know who killed my brother!

60
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:06,788
What's the matter with you, punk?

61
00:06:13,848 --> 00:06:16,469
Boss, Packy wants another drink
on the cuff.

62
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,554
Give it to him.

63
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:21,269
And here's the cut on the shape-up.

64
00:06:21,356 --> 00:06:25,852
891 men, $3 a head. That's $2,673.

65
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,695
Charley, you count them.

66
00:06:30,115 --> 00:06:31,989
The banana boat is 46 tomorrow.

67
00:06:32,076 --> 00:06:35,492
If we pull a walkout,
it might be a few bucks from the shippers.

68
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:38,331
- Them bananas go bad in a hurry.
- Ask $2,000.

69
00:06:40,418 --> 00:06:42,043
Clowns can't fight.

70
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:46,332
There's nobody tough anymore.

71
00:06:46,842 --> 00:06:48,252
Hi, slugger.

72
00:06:49,511 --> 00:06:50,542
Hi, kid.

73
00:06:55,935 --> 00:06:58,640
Where's Morgan?
Where's that big banker of mine?

74
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:00,272
Right here, Mr. Friendly.

75
00:07:00,356 --> 00:07:03,690
- Hi, JP, how's business?
- Having trouble with Kelly again, boss.

76
00:07:03,776 --> 00:07:06,694
He won't take no loans
and Big Mac puts him to work anyway.

77
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,353
- He's my wife's nephew.
- He won't take no loans!

78
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:11,857
I got to put him to work.
She'd murder me!

79
00:07:11,952 --> 00:07:13,992
That's why I never got married.

80
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,199
Here's the interest on the day, boss. $532.

81
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,115
You count it.

82
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,953
Counting makes me sleepy.

83
00:07:21,546 --> 00:07:23,503
You handle that sheet metal all right?

84
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:26,460
It was easy. The new checker faked
the receipt. Here.

85
00:07:26,551 --> 00:07:29,386
You want to talk to me,
take the cigar out of your mouth.

86
00:07:29,471 --> 00:07:31,796
- Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
- Sure.

87
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:35,390
- Here you are, 45 bills.
- Terry, you count this.

88
00:07:38,355 --> 00:07:40,229
Come on, go on, it's good for you.

89
00:07:40,316 --> 00:07:42,143
- It develops your mind.
- What mind?

90
00:07:42,234 --> 00:07:43,943
Shut up. I like the kid.

91
00:07:44,028 --> 00:07:47,278
Remember the night
he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley?

92
00:07:47,365 --> 00:07:50,699
We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try.

93
00:07:50,785 --> 00:07:52,493
I lost the count.

94
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,913
Okay, forget it, Einstein.

95
00:07:57,209 --> 00:08:00,459
How come you never got an education
like your brother Charley?

96
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:04,378
The only arithmetic he ever got
was hearing the referee count up to 10.

97
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:07,088
You're not too funny today, Fat Man.

98
00:08:08,429 --> 00:08:11,964
Hey, what gives
with our boy tonight, Charley?

99
00:08:12,267 --> 00:08:13,595
He isn't himself.

100
00:08:13,685 --> 00:08:17,137
It's the Joey Doyle thing
and how he exaggerates the thing.

101
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,185
Too much Marquis of Queensbury
softens him up.

102
00:08:20,275 --> 00:08:23,360
Listen, I'm a soft touch, too.
Ask any rummy on the dock...

103
00:08:23,445 --> 00:08:27,028
if I'm not good for a fin any time
they put the arm on me.

104
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:32,197
But my old lady raised us 10 kids
on a stinking watchman's pension.

105
00:08:32,872 --> 00:08:36,822
When I was 16,
I had to beg for work in the hold.

106
00:08:38,086 --> 00:08:40,577
I didn't work my way up
out of there for nothing.

107
00:08:40,672 --> 00:08:42,499
I know that, Johnny, I know it.

108
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:44,880
Taking over this local took a little doing.

109
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:48,836
There were rough fellas in the way.
They gave me this to remember them by.

110
00:08:48,931 --> 00:08:53,060
He kept his hand over his throat
to stay alive and he still went after them.

111
00:08:53,144 --> 00:08:54,888
I know what's eating you.

112
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:01,402
I got 2,000 dues-paying members in this
local, that's $72,000 a year legitimate.

113
00:09:01,862 --> 00:09:06,191
When each one of them puts in a couple
of bucks a day just to make sure...

114
00:09:06,283 --> 00:09:08,988
the work's steady, well, figure it out.

115
00:09:09,328 --> 00:09:11,036
That's just for openers.

116
00:09:11,122 --> 00:09:14,289
We've got the fattest piers
in the fattest harbor in the world.

117
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,617
Everything moves in and out,
we take our cut.

118
00:09:16,711 --> 00:09:20,709
Why shouldn't we?
If we can get it, we're entitled to it.

119
00:09:21,049 --> 00:09:24,798
You don't suppose I can afford to be
boxed out of a deal like this, do you?

120
00:09:24,887 --> 00:09:29,098
A deal I sweated and bled for, on account
of one lousy little cheese-eater...

121
00:09:29,183 --> 00:09:33,512
that Doyle bum, who thinks he can
squeal to the crime commission. Do you?

122
00:09:39,611 --> 00:09:40,642
Do you?

123
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:46,534
No, Johnny.
I just figured I should have been told.

124
00:09:46,618 --> 00:09:48,326
I make it $2,623.

125
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:50,912
You're $50 short, Skins.

126
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,161
Gimme.

127
00:09:59,591 --> 00:10:02,757
- I must've miscounted.
- Gimme!

128
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:14,723
You come from Green Point, go back there.
You don't work here no more.

129
00:10:21,447 --> 00:10:24,152
Here, kid, here's half a bill.
Go get you a load on.

130
00:10:24,242 --> 00:10:25,902
No, I'm okay, Johnny, thanks.

131
00:10:25,994 --> 00:10:28,034
Present from your Uncle Johnny.

132
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:33,456
And Mac, tomorrow morning when you
shape the men, put Terry up in the loft.

133
00:10:33,544 --> 00:10:35,999
Number one. Every day.

134
00:10:36,881 --> 00:10:40,332
It's nice, easy work if you check in
and goof off on a coffee bag.

135
00:10:40,426 --> 00:10:41,755
Okay?

136
00:10:48,935 --> 00:10:50,762
You got a real friend here.

137
00:10:51,146 --> 00:10:52,688
Now don't forget it.

138
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,398
Why should he forget it?

139
00:10:55,526 --> 00:10:57,103
Thanks, Johnny.

140
00:11:05,787 --> 00:11:07,495
All right, payday.

141
00:11:08,373 --> 00:11:09,404
Rony.

142
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:11,657
Mac.

143
00:11:35,068 --> 00:11:36,444
Hi, Terry.

144
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,814
- Hi, kid.
- I was just going to feed them.

145
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,368
I already fed them.

146
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,244
You must've been up early?

147
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,368
I was up anyhow,
so I figured I might as well.

148
00:11:51,336 --> 00:11:52,913
They sure got it made.

149
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:58,046
Eating, sleeping, flying around like crazy,
raising gobs of squabs.

150
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,883
Well, I better get over there.

151
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:16,395
Be careful. Don't spill no water on the
floor. I don't want them to catch cold.

152
00:12:17,155 --> 00:12:18,697
I'll see you around.

153
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,784
Come on, Tony, give me the tabs.

154
00:12:33,881 --> 00:12:35,708
He was a good boy, that Doyle kid.

155
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,089
Sure he was,
that's why he got it in the head.

156
00:12:38,178 --> 00:12:40,847
But he couldn't learn
to keep his mouth shut.

157
00:12:46,145 --> 00:12:48,387
Hey, Pop, why don't you go home?

158
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,102
The boys at work today
will be chipping in gladly.

159
00:12:51,192 --> 00:12:53,066
No thanks, fellas, I'm gonna shape.

160
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:57,980
- Who do you think'll pay for the funeral?
- Johnny Friendly, the "great labor leader."

161
00:12:58,575 --> 00:13:01,362
Why don't you keep that big mouth
of yours shut?

162
00:13:01,453 --> 00:13:03,196
What are you, a wise guy?

163
00:13:03,372 --> 00:13:06,492
If I was wise, I wouldn't be
no longshoreman for 30 years.

164
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:08,790
I'm poorer now than when I started.

165
00:13:08,877 --> 00:13:10,455
- Wise guy.
- Big mouth.

166
00:13:12,006 --> 00:13:14,164
Don't mess with those guys.

167
00:13:14,842 --> 00:13:18,258
I brought you Joey's windbreaker.
It might come in handy.

168
00:13:18,346 --> 00:13:21,133
- Go ahead, wear it.
- Thanks, Pop.

169
00:13:21,224 --> 00:13:24,261
Mine's more full of holes
than the Pittsburgh infield.

170
00:13:24,352 --> 00:13:27,307
Hey, Joe, I got a coat for you.

171
00:13:39,535 --> 00:13:41,279
Do you know Terry Malloy?

172
00:13:41,746 --> 00:13:43,905
No, I don't. Never heard of him.

173
00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:49,245
You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?

174
00:13:51,381 --> 00:13:52,461
So what?

175
00:13:52,549 --> 00:13:55,219
Didn't I see you fight
a couple of years ago?

176
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,463
Without the birdseed, what do you want?

177
00:13:58,556 --> 00:14:00,299
Identification.

178
00:14:04,771 --> 00:14:06,929
Waterfront Crime Commission.
What's that?

179
00:14:07,023 --> 00:14:09,063
I just want to ask you a few questions.

180
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,820
We'll hold public hearings
on waterfront crime...

181
00:14:11,904 --> 00:14:14,573
and underworld infiltration
of longshore unions.

182
00:14:14,657 --> 00:14:17,907
- I don't know nothing.
- You haven't heard the questions yet.

183
00:14:17,993 --> 00:14:20,117
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

184
00:14:20,204 --> 00:14:24,333
There's a rumor that you're one of
the last people to see Joey Doyle alive.

185
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:25,698
I don't know nothing.

186
00:14:25,793 --> 00:14:28,119
Nobody's accusing you of anything,
Mr. Malloy.

187
00:14:28,213 --> 00:14:29,707
I hope you understand that.

188
00:14:29,798 --> 00:14:33,582
Just want to ask you some questions
about some people you may know.

189
00:14:35,721 --> 00:14:37,927
- People I may know.
- That's right.

190
00:14:38,807 --> 00:14:41,974
- You better get out of here, buster!
- Slow down, boy.

191
00:14:43,563 --> 00:14:47,062
I don't know nothing, I ain't seen nothing,
and I'm not saying nothing.

192
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,439
Why don't you and your girlfriend take off.

193
00:14:49,527 --> 00:14:50,938
All right, Mr. Malloy!

194
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:54,114
You've every right not to talk
if that's what you choose to do.

195
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:56,690
- The public has a right to know the facts.
- Yeah.

196
00:14:56,785 --> 00:14:58,279
We'll be seeing you again.

197
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,241
Never's going to be too much soon
for me, Shorty.

198
00:15:01,749 --> 00:15:02,994
Take it easy.

199
00:15:05,253 --> 00:15:08,005
How do you like them mutts
taking me for a pigeon.

200
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:10,628
- Who is it?
- I don't know who they are.

201
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:14,876
You're three weeks behind on the last $25,
but I'm willing to take a chance.

202
00:15:14,971 --> 00:15:18,471
Some chance at ten percent a week
and if we don't borrow, we don't work.

203
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:20,267
May you rot in hell, JP.

204
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:23,682
When I'm dead and gone,
you'll know what a friend I was.

205
00:15:23,773 --> 00:15:26,774
Why don't you drop dead now,
so we can test your theory?

206
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,353
Condolences.

207
00:15:29,404 --> 00:15:30,862
Hey, Pop, look.

208
00:15:36,953 --> 00:15:38,412
Let her go, Tony.

209
00:15:54,931 --> 00:15:57,339
I guess I spoke out of turn last night.

210
00:16:00,437 --> 00:16:04,601
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider
with a turned-around collar, don't you?

211
00:16:10,656 --> 00:16:13,147
I see the sisters taught you not to lie.

212
00:16:15,286 --> 00:16:18,537
All right. Loft gang: Malloy...

213
00:16:19,082 --> 00:16:21,869
Hendriks, Padowski...

214
00:16:22,502 --> 00:16:24,579
Westerfield, McGuier.

215
00:16:28,467 --> 00:16:31,717
I've been thinking about your question,
and you're right, Edie.

216
00:16:33,973 --> 00:16:35,432
This is my parish.

217
00:16:36,225 --> 00:16:39,096
I don't know how much I can do,
but I'll never find out...

218
00:16:39,187 --> 00:16:42,556
unless I come down here
and take a good look for myself.

219
00:16:42,732 --> 00:16:45,224
I need some extra banana carriers.

220
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:46,398
Bananas again.

221
00:16:46,486 --> 00:16:50,437
I wonder when we'll get a boat from
Ireland with good Irish whiskey on it.

222
00:16:50,532 --> 00:16:52,821
Dugan, my boy, you're dreaming again.

223
00:16:53,619 --> 00:16:57,368
All right. Kelly. Richie.

224
00:17:07,884 --> 00:17:08,999
Yeah, you.

225
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:14,134
What's the matter?
Nobody want to work today?

226
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,061
Yeah, you.

227
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:28,240
Who do you see to get
a day's pay around here?

228
00:17:43,298 --> 00:17:45,623
- Meatballs.
- Definitely.

229
00:17:51,848 --> 00:17:53,129
Come here.

230
00:17:53,225 --> 00:17:55,846
Hey, Terry, grab that one!

231
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:02,441
Give me that.

232
00:18:02,527 --> 00:18:03,558
Get away!

233
00:18:03,945 --> 00:18:06,697
- Give it to me!
- Why?

234
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,614
Give it to me!

235
00:18:09,284 --> 00:18:11,111
What makes you so special?

236
00:18:12,287 --> 00:18:14,079
Things are looking up on the dock.

237
00:18:14,164 --> 00:18:16,786
Don't you recognize her?
That's Joey Doyle's sister.

238
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,251
Give me that.

239
00:18:20,921 --> 00:18:24,006
- You're Joey Doyle's sister?
- Yes, I am.

240
00:18:26,636 --> 00:18:29,209
You don't wanna go to work today anyhow.

241
00:18:30,098 --> 00:18:32,256
It's been nice wrestling with you.

242
00:18:36,605 --> 00:18:37,636
Edie!

243
00:18:38,482 --> 00:18:41,103
Pop. Here's your tab, take it.

244
00:18:43,362 --> 00:18:45,604
All right, give it to me. I can use it.

245
00:18:45,698 --> 00:18:48,106
Now get back to the sisters
where you belong.

246
00:18:48,201 --> 00:18:51,700
I'm surprised at you, Father,
if you don't mind my saying so.

247
00:18:51,788 --> 00:18:55,371
Letting her see things ain't fit
for the eyes of a decent girl.

248
00:18:55,584 --> 00:18:58,253
All right, that's all. Come back tomorrow.

249
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:05,586
What do you do now?

250
00:19:06,053 --> 00:19:08,260
Like Big Mac said, come back tomorrow.

251
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,305
Tomorrow? No ship tomorrow.

252
00:19:10,391 --> 00:19:13,926
I've been standing here for five
straight mornings and that bum there...

253
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,686
- Come on, get out of here!
...looks right through you.

254
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:22,652
- I'm sorry, Father, I didn't mean it.
- What do you want to do?

255
00:19:22,988 --> 00:19:24,862
Come on, let's go get a ball.

256
00:19:24,949 --> 00:19:28,282
Wait a minute.
Is this all you do, just take it like this?

257
00:19:29,829 --> 00:19:31,537
What about your unions?

258
00:19:35,543 --> 00:19:38,544
No other union in the country'd
stand for a thing like that.

259
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:42,046
The waterfront is tougher, Father,
like it ain't part of America.

260
00:19:42,134 --> 00:19:45,918
- Do you know how a trigger local works?
- No. How?

261
00:19:46,013 --> 00:19:50,675
You get up in the meeting, you make a
motion, the lights go out, then you go out.

262
00:19:50,768 --> 00:19:54,303
That's how it's been since Johnny
and his cowboys took over the local.

263
00:19:54,397 --> 00:19:57,564
Name one place where it's safe
to talk without getting clobbered.

264
00:19:57,650 --> 00:19:59,774
- The church.
- What?

265
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,072
The bottom of the church.

266
00:20:04,157 --> 00:20:06,827
You know
what you're letting yourself in for?

267
00:20:08,787 --> 00:20:10,614
You got a cigarette on you?

268
00:20:22,218 --> 00:20:23,843
Right over there.

269
00:20:31,312 --> 00:20:33,933
- You working hard?
- Yeah.

270
00:20:34,023 --> 00:20:38,650
You wouldn't mind working once in a while
to justify this lofty position, would you?

271
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,818
I finished the work.
I counted all them bags.

272
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:44,781
We have an extra detail for you.

273
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:48,202
That's if you don't mind
being disturbed or anything.

274
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:54,703
The priest and this Doyle girl are getting
a meeting up together down at the church.

275
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:58,129
We want a rundown on the names
and the numbers of all the players.

276
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:01,300
Wait a minute. All right, you're nominated.

277
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:04,345
Why me, Charley?
I feel funny going down there.

278
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,847
I'd just be stooling for you.

279
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:10,634
Let me tell you what stooling is.
Stooling is when you rat on your friend...

280
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:12,971
the guys you're with.
Johnny wants a favor.

281
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:15,223
Don't think about it. Do it.

282
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:19,479
Go on. Join the congregation.

283
00:21:35,881 --> 00:21:38,551
I thought there would be
more of you here, but...

284
00:21:40,386 --> 00:21:44,384
The Romans found out what a handful
could do if it's the right handful.

285
00:21:48,686 --> 00:21:53,313
I'm just a potato-eater,
but isn't it simple as one, two, three?

286
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,357
One. The working conditions are bad.

287
00:21:55,444 --> 00:21:57,982
Two. They're bad
because the mob does the hiring.

288
00:21:58,072 --> 00:22:02,615
Three. The only way to break the mob is
to stop letting them get away with murder.

289
00:22:02,785 --> 00:22:06,237
If one of you'll answer one question,
we'd have a very good start.

290
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:09,534
And that question is:
Who killed Joey Doyle?

291
00:22:18,427 --> 00:22:21,428
Not one of you has a line
on who killed Joey Doyle?

292
00:22:25,184 --> 00:22:28,553
I have a hunch all of you
could tell us something about it.

293
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,481
All right, then answer this one:

294
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:37,110
How can we call ourselves Christians and
protect these murderers with our silence?

295
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:45,992
Jimmy Collins, you were Joey's best friend.

296
00:22:46,415 --> 00:22:48,871
How can you just sit there
and not say anything?

297
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,625
I'll always think of him as my best friend,
but what do you want me to...

298
00:22:52,714 --> 00:22:54,338
Who asked him in here?

299
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,921
I'm trying to find out
what happened to Joey Doyle.

300
00:22:58,011 --> 00:23:00,218
- Maybe you can be helpful.
- Helpful?

301
00:23:00,597 --> 00:23:02,424
The brother of Charley the Gent?

302
00:23:02,516 --> 00:23:04,888
They'll help us get to the bottom
of the river.

303
00:23:04,977 --> 00:23:06,934
You better leave Charley out of this.

304
00:23:07,021 --> 00:23:10,390
- You don't think he'd be helpful?
- Why don't you ask him yourself?

305
00:23:10,483 --> 00:23:15,062
- Maybe I will one of these days.
- One of these days.

306
00:23:16,322 --> 00:23:18,861
Now, listen, you know who the pistols are.

307
00:23:20,202 --> 00:23:23,785
Are you going to keep still
until they cut you down one by one?

308
00:23:25,499 --> 00:23:26,662
Are you?

309
00:23:28,043 --> 00:23:30,120
Dugan! How about you? Are you?

310
00:23:30,212 --> 00:23:32,917
One thing you have to understand,
Father, on the dock...

311
00:23:33,007 --> 00:23:34,834
we've always been D and D.

312
00:23:34,926 --> 00:23:36,965
- D and D? What's that?
- Deaf and dumb.

313
00:23:37,053 --> 00:23:39,888
No matter how much
we hate the torpedoes, we don't rat.

314
00:23:39,973 --> 00:23:42,429
Rat? Now boys, get smart.

315
00:23:43,477 --> 00:23:46,597
I know you're getting pushed around,
but there's one thing...

316
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:49,606
we have in this country,
and that's ways of fighting back.

317
00:23:49,692 --> 00:23:51,400
Getting the facts to the public.

318
00:23:51,569 --> 00:23:54,486
Testifying for what is right against
what is wrong.

319
00:23:54,572 --> 00:23:58,617
What's ratting to them is telling the truth
for you, can't you see that?

320
00:24:00,203 --> 00:24:02,326
Can't you see that?

321
00:24:19,515 --> 00:24:22,801
It seems to me we've gone just about
as far as we can at this time.

322
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:25,385
I think you'll agree with that, Father.

323
00:24:25,647 --> 00:24:28,933
So, I'd like to close with a few words
from St. Matthew:

324
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:32,111
"Come unto me all you..."

325
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:41,367
What did I tell you
about sticking your neck out.

326
00:24:41,497 --> 00:24:44,701
- This is a police problem, not ours.
- These people need help.

327
00:24:44,793 --> 00:24:47,913
Okay. Only don't blame me when
they ship you off to Abyssinia.

328
00:24:48,004 --> 00:24:49,036
I won't.

329
00:24:56,555 --> 00:24:59,592
You better go home in pairs.
Twos is two, you know.

330
00:25:00,893 --> 00:25:02,091
Come on.

331
00:25:04,772 --> 00:25:07,180
Pop!

332
00:25:18,829 --> 00:25:21,451
Edie!

333
00:25:39,184 --> 00:25:40,643
What's happened to Pop?

334
00:25:40,728 --> 00:25:43,812
He's all right.
He's an old man, they won't hurt him.

335
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,435
Get out, you!

336
00:25:52,198 --> 00:25:53,776
Are you all right?

337
00:25:53,867 --> 00:25:56,702
Yeah, considering they were using
my head for a baseball.

338
00:25:56,787 --> 00:25:59,242
You still D and D?
Do you still call it ratting?

339
00:25:59,331 --> 00:26:01,454
- Are you on the level?
- What do you think?

340
00:26:01,542 --> 00:26:04,578
If I stick my neck out and it's
chopped off, is that the end?

341
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:07,292
- Or will you go all the way?
- Down the line.

342
00:26:07,381 --> 00:26:10,751
They'll put muscle on you, too,
turned-around collar or not.

343
00:26:10,843 --> 00:26:15,256
Wipe your face. Listen, you stand up
and I'll stand up with you.

344
00:26:15,348 --> 00:26:17,306
- Right down the wire?
- So help me God.

345
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,224
I think we're okay.

346
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:25,474
Steel pipes and baseball bats.

347
00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:27,816
They play pretty rough around here.

348
00:26:27,903 --> 00:26:30,062
I can make it home now all right.

349
00:26:32,075 --> 00:26:33,783
Which side are you with?

350
00:26:34,953 --> 00:26:36,862
Me? I'm with me, Terry.

351
00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:39,995
You got a dime for a cup of coffee?

352
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:41,875
Go on, beat it, will you?

353
00:26:42,085 --> 00:26:44,043
A little dime you don't need?

354
00:26:45,172 --> 00:26:48,755
I know you. You're Edie Doyle.

355
00:26:49,969 --> 00:26:51,167
Come on. Beat it.

356
00:26:51,262 --> 00:26:55,675
Your brother was a saint, the only one
who ever tried to get me compensation.

357
00:26:56,434 --> 00:26:57,763
You remember, Terry.

358
00:26:57,852 --> 00:26:59,596
You was there that night.

359
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,022
Here's some change.
Go have yourself a ball.

360
00:27:06,695 --> 00:27:10,195
You don't buy me. You're still a bum.

361
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,195
So long, Edie.

362
00:27:13,202 --> 00:27:14,910
Lord have mercy on Joey.

363
00:27:16,748 --> 00:27:18,456
Who's calling me a bum?

364
00:27:21,378 --> 00:27:22,955
Everybody loved Joey.

365
00:27:24,256 --> 00:27:26,498
From little kids to the old rummies.

366
00:27:28,761 --> 00:27:30,588
Did you know him very well?

367
00:27:32,139 --> 00:27:33,847
You know, he got around.

368
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,637
What did that man mean just now?

369
00:27:37,729 --> 00:27:41,513
Don't pay no attention to him.
He's drunk, he's falling down. Everything.

370
00:27:41,608 --> 00:27:44,313
He's a juicehead
that hangs around the neighborhood.

371
00:27:44,402 --> 00:27:46,110
Don't pay no attention.

372
00:27:46,446 --> 00:27:47,822
I better go now.

373
00:27:48,657 --> 00:27:52,157
You don't have to be afraid of me.
I'm not going to bite you.

374
00:27:52,828 --> 00:27:56,244
I guess they don't let you walk
with fellas where you've been?

375
00:27:56,332 --> 00:27:58,206
You know how the sisters are.

376
00:27:58,292 --> 00:27:59,288
Yeah.

377
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:03,505
- Are you training to be a nun?
- It's just a regular college.

378
00:28:05,258 --> 00:28:07,584
It's run by the Sisters of St. Anne.

379
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:09,632
Where is that?

380
00:28:10,681 --> 00:28:11,926
In Tarrytown.

381
00:28:13,142 --> 00:28:15,514
- Where's that?
- In the country.

382
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:19,228
I don't like the country.
The crickets make me nervous.

383
00:28:21,692 --> 00:28:23,650
How often do you get in here?

384
00:28:26,156 --> 00:28:28,694
I haven't been here since last Christmas.

385
00:28:29,034 --> 00:28:31,607
We were going to have
a Thanksgiving party.

386
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,445
That's nice.

387
00:28:35,624 --> 00:28:38,376
What do you do up there? Just study?

388
00:28:39,462 --> 00:28:41,039
I want to be a teacher.

389
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,668
Teacher? That's very good.

390
00:28:44,258 --> 00:28:46,050
Personally, I admire brains.

391
00:28:46,135 --> 00:28:50,465
My brother Charley is a very brainy guy.
He had a couple of years of college.

392
00:28:51,057 --> 00:28:55,186
It isn't just brains.
It's how you use them.

393
00:28:55,354 --> 00:28:57,596
Yeah, I get your thought.

394
00:28:57,898 --> 00:29:00,306
You know, I've seen you
a lot of times before.

395
00:29:00,401 --> 00:29:03,770
Do you remember parochial school
out on Puluski Street?

396
00:29:03,863 --> 00:29:05,606
Seven, eight years ago?

397
00:29:05,698 --> 00:29:08,189
- Your hair, you had your hair...
- Braids.

398
00:29:08,284 --> 00:29:10,775
Looked like a hunk of rope.

399
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:14,738
You had wires on your teeth and glasses.
Everything.

400
00:29:15,792 --> 00:29:17,417
You was really a mess.

401
00:29:18,504 --> 00:29:20,829
I can get home all right now, thanks.

402
00:29:21,382 --> 00:29:24,217
Don't get sore.
I was just kidding you a little bit.

403
00:29:24,301 --> 00:29:27,967
I just mean to tell you that you're,
you grew up very nice.

404
00:29:29,515 --> 00:29:30,547
Thanks.

405
00:29:31,726 --> 00:29:33,766
You don't remember me, do you?

406
00:29:36,773 --> 00:29:39,146
I remembered you
the first moment I saw you.

407
00:29:39,234 --> 00:29:40,645
By the nose, huh?

408
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:47,319
Some people just got faces that
stick in your mind.

409
00:29:50,621 --> 00:29:52,947
I remember you were in trouble
all the time.

410
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,369
Now you got me.

411
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:59,336
The way those sisters used to whack me,
I don't know what.

412
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:04,421
They thought they was going to beat
an education into me, but I foxed them.

413
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:08,968
Maybe they just didn't know how
to handle you.

414
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,385
How would you have done it?

415
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:15,851
With a little more patience and kindness.

416
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:19,647
That's what makes people
mean and difficult.

417
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:22,062
People don't care enough about them.

418
00:30:26,702 --> 00:30:28,445
Are you kidding me?

419
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:30,531
I'd better get you home.

420
00:30:30,623 --> 00:30:34,455
There's too many guys around here
with only one thing on their mind.

421
00:30:36,212 --> 00:30:38,121
Am I going to see you again?

422
00:30:41,134 --> 00:30:42,463
What for?

423
00:30:45,722 --> 00:30:46,967
I don't know.

424
00:30:51,771 --> 00:30:53,810
I really don't know.

425
00:30:59,529 --> 00:31:00,857
Come on.

426
00:31:17,965 --> 00:31:22,628
You're all packed. Here's your bus ticket
and you're on your way back to St. Anne's.

427
00:31:23,346 --> 00:31:25,505
I'm not ready to go back yet, Pop.

428
00:31:26,183 --> 00:31:29,386
Edie, for years your mom and me
put quarters in the cookie jar...

429
00:31:29,478 --> 00:31:32,183
to keep you up there with the sisters...

430
00:31:32,439 --> 00:31:36,224
and keep you from things like
I've just seen outside the window.

431
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:39,777
A daughter of mine walking arm in arm
with Terry Malloy.

432
00:31:39,864 --> 00:31:42,533
- Do you know who Terry Malloy is?
- Who is he, Pop?

433
00:31:42,617 --> 00:31:45,238
He's the kid brother of Charley the Gent...

434
00:31:45,412 --> 00:31:49,623
who is Johnny Friendly's right hand
and a butcher in a camel hair coat.

435
00:31:51,251 --> 00:31:53,577
Are you trying to tell me Terry is, too?

436
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:55,379
He tries to act tough...

437
00:31:57,925 --> 00:32:00,084
but there's a look in his eye.

438
00:32:00,428 --> 00:32:04,556
Yeah, a look in his eye.
Hold your hats, brothers, here we go again.

439
00:32:05,183 --> 00:32:09,263
You think he's one of them cases
you're always dragging into the house...

440
00:32:09,354 --> 00:32:10,813
and feeling sorry for...

441
00:32:10,897 --> 00:32:13,519
like that litter of
kittens you brought in.

442
00:32:13,775 --> 00:32:18,687
The only one you wanted to keep
had six toes and was cockeyed to boot.

443
00:32:19,532 --> 00:32:21,489
Look at him. The little bum.

444
00:32:21,993 --> 00:32:24,151
He said he wants to see me again.

445
00:32:31,086 --> 00:32:32,794
See this arm?

446
00:32:35,132 --> 00:32:37,290
Two inches longer than the other.

447
00:32:37,843 --> 00:32:44,261
That's from years of working and sweating,
lifting and swinging a hook.

448
00:32:46,477 --> 00:32:51,056
Every time I heist a box or a coffee bag,
I says to myself...

449
00:32:51,524 --> 00:32:55,143
that is for Edie so she can be
a teacher or something decent.

450
00:32:57,739 --> 00:33:01,025
I promised your mom, Edie.
Don't let her down.

451
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,698
I don't want you to think I'm not
grateful for everything you've done.

452
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:11,327
For giving me the education
and keeping me away from all this.

453
00:33:12,464 --> 00:33:15,002
But I've seen things
that I know are so wrong.

454
00:33:15,091 --> 00:33:19,635
How can I go back to school and keep
my mind on things that are just in books...

455
00:33:19,721 --> 00:33:21,679
that aren't people living?

456
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,392
I'm going to stay.

457
00:33:24,476 --> 00:33:28,474
I'm going to keep on trying
to find out who is guilty for Joey.

458
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:18,690
Hi.

459
00:34:19,202 --> 00:34:21,693
What are you doing up there on the roof?

460
00:34:23,874 --> 00:34:25,285
Just looking.

461
00:34:26,335 --> 00:34:29,455
Take a look at the champion flock
of the neighborhood.

462
00:34:31,215 --> 00:34:32,793
Fly pretty nice, huh?

463
00:34:34,427 --> 00:34:35,802
Golden Warriors?

464
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:40,631
Yeah. I founded the Golden Warriors.

465
00:34:41,351 --> 00:34:43,924
Might say that I was
the original Golden Warrior.

466
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,313
This bum here is my shadow.

467
00:34:48,609 --> 00:34:51,526
He thinks I'm a tough man
because I boxed pro a lot.

468
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:57,276
Joey used to raise pigeons.

469
00:35:00,455 --> 00:35:02,198
Joey used to raise pigeons.

470
00:35:04,709 --> 00:35:06,453
Yeah, he had a few birds.

471
00:35:09,506 --> 00:35:11,499
I've been taking care of them.

472
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:15,384
I wouldn't have thought
you'd be so interested in pigeons.

473
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,182
I just go for it.

474
00:35:22,437 --> 00:35:24,679
You know this city is full of hawks?

475
00:35:25,106 --> 00:35:28,558
That's a fact.
They hang around on top of the big hotels.

476
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:34,064
They spot a pigeon in the park,
right down on them.

477
00:35:36,368 --> 00:35:37,744
You got a second?

478
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:43,790
I want to show you something.

479
00:35:52,511 --> 00:35:55,216
What do you think of that fellow?

480
00:35:55,931 --> 00:35:57,212
She's a beauty.

481
00:35:57,307 --> 00:35:59,384
She's a he. His name is Swifty.

482
00:36:01,103 --> 00:36:02,895
Look what he went and did.

483
00:36:07,777 --> 00:36:12,238
He's my lead bird. He's always on
top of the perch. If another bum tries...

484
00:36:12,324 --> 00:36:15,942
to come along and take his place,
he really lets him have it.

485
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,787
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.

486
00:36:22,168 --> 00:36:25,204
There's one thing about them,
they're very faithful.

487
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:27,665
They get married just like people.

488
00:36:27,757 --> 00:36:28,706
Better.

489
00:36:29,676 --> 00:36:32,249
They stay that way until one of them dies.

490
00:36:33,888 --> 00:36:35,169
That's nice.

491
00:36:41,605 --> 00:36:43,313
Go ahead. Fix the roof.

492
00:36:47,194 --> 00:36:48,903
You want that egg?

493
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:53,944
Thanks.

494
00:36:58,498 --> 00:36:59,909
Do you like beer?

495
00:37:02,127 --> 00:37:03,586
I don't know.

496
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:07,831
I bet you never had a glass of beer.

497
00:37:08,301 --> 00:37:10,970
- Did you ever have a glass of beer?
- No.

498
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:17,224
You want to have one with me?

499
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:20,551
In a saloon?

500
00:37:21,189 --> 00:37:25,733
I know a nice dump down here
that has a special entrance for ladies.

501
00:37:31,158 --> 00:37:32,867
Come on, it won't hurt.

502
00:37:36,039 --> 00:37:37,284
Come on.

503
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,955
Okay.

504
00:37:49,011 --> 00:37:50,505
Hey, you, mac.

505
00:37:52,431 --> 00:37:54,839
Two Glockenheimers and two for chasers.

506
00:37:56,227 --> 00:37:58,635
- Did you see the fight last night?
- No.

507
00:37:59,189 --> 00:38:02,309
A kid named Riley, both hands.
Like you used to do.

508
00:38:04,653 --> 00:38:06,811
I hope he got better dice than me.

509
00:38:10,659 --> 00:38:12,818
Were you really a prizefighter?

510
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:15,575
I used to be.

511
00:38:17,458 --> 00:38:19,665
How did you get interested in that?

512
00:38:19,877 --> 00:38:24,504
I don't know. I had to scrap all my life,
I might as well get paid for it.

513
00:38:25,842 --> 00:38:28,380
When I was a kid
my old man got bumped off.

514
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:32,682
Never mind how.
Then they stuck Charley and me...

515
00:38:34,685 --> 00:38:37,057
in a dump they call a "children's home."

516
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,898
Boy, that was some home.

517
00:38:42,277 --> 00:38:45,776
Anyhow, I ran away from there
and fought in the club smokers...

518
00:38:45,864 --> 00:38:48,948
and peddled papers and Johnny Friendly
bought a piece of me.

519
00:38:49,034 --> 00:38:50,528
Bought a piece of you?

520
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:53,786
Yes. Then...

521
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,334
I was going pretty
good there for awhile.

522
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,079
And after that...

523
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,999
What do you really care, am I right?

524
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,635
Shouldn't everybody care about
everybody else?

525
00:39:14,812 --> 00:39:16,804
Boy, what a fruitcake you are.

526
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,811
I mean, isn't everybody
a part of everybody else?

527
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:23,442
And you really believe that drool?

528
00:39:23,529 --> 00:39:24,858
Yes, I do.

529
00:39:27,242 --> 00:39:30,326
Here we are. One for the lady
and for the gent.

530
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:35,707
Here's to the first one,
I hope it ain't the last.

531
00:39:37,753 --> 00:39:39,247
Go ahead.

532
00:39:45,344 --> 00:39:47,254
No, not like that. One hum.

533
00:39:59,443 --> 00:40:02,016
Do you want to hear my philosophy of life?

534
00:40:05,116 --> 00:40:07,488
Do it to him before he does it to you.

535
00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:10,279
I never met anyone like you.

536
00:40:12,081 --> 00:40:16,993
There's not a spark of sentiment,
or romance...

537
00:40:17,087 --> 00:40:19,210
or human kindness in your whole body.

538
00:40:19,298 --> 00:40:22,049
What good does it to you
besides get you in trouble?

539
00:40:22,134 --> 00:40:26,002
And when things and people get in
your way, you just knock them aside...

540
00:40:26,097 --> 00:40:28,173
get rid of them. Is that your idea?

541
00:40:28,266 --> 00:40:32,180
Don't look at me when you say that.
It wasn't my fault what happened to Joey.

542
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:34,061
Fixing him wasn't my idea.

543
00:40:35,315 --> 00:40:36,690
Who said it was?

544
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:39,392
Everybody's putting the needle on me.

545
00:40:40,112 --> 00:40:42,947
You and the mugs in the church
and Father Barry.

546
00:40:43,031 --> 00:40:45,273
I didn't like the way he was looking at me.

547
00:40:45,367 --> 00:40:47,609
He was looking at everybody
the same way.

548
00:40:47,703 --> 00:40:48,782
Oh, yeah?

549
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:51,740
What's with this Father Barry?

550
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,206
- What's his racket?
- His racket?

551
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:55,836
Yeah, his racket.

552
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,293
- Everybody's got a racket.
- But he's a priest.

553
00:40:58,381 --> 00:40:59,924
Are you kidding, so what?

554
00:41:00,008 --> 00:41:03,840
- That don't make no difference.
- You don't believe anybody, do you?

555
00:41:04,763 --> 00:41:06,970
Down here it's every man for himself.

556
00:41:07,057 --> 00:41:10,509
It's keeping alive. It's standing
with the right people so you get...

557
00:41:10,603 --> 00:41:13,094
a little bit of change in your pocket.

558
00:41:13,189 --> 00:41:15,894
- And if you don't?
- If you don't? Right down.

559
00:41:17,777 --> 00:41:19,604
It's living like an animal.

560
00:41:20,572 --> 00:41:23,490
I'd rather live like an animal
than end up like...

561
00:41:23,575 --> 00:41:24,654
Like Joey?

562
00:41:26,286 --> 00:41:28,778
- Are you afraid to mention his name?
- No.

563
00:41:30,666 --> 00:41:32,908
Why do you keep harping on that for?

564
00:41:34,295 --> 00:41:37,664
Come on, drink up.
You got to get a little fun out of life.

565
00:41:37,924 --> 00:41:40,130
Come on. I'll stick some music on.

566
00:41:47,434 --> 00:41:48,928
What's the matter?

567
00:41:56,569 --> 00:41:59,274
What's the matter with you?

568
00:42:02,575 --> 00:42:04,782
Help me if you can for God's sake.

569
00:42:09,041 --> 00:42:10,868
Edie, I'd like to help.

570
00:42:12,086 --> 00:42:14,837
I'd like to help,
but there's nothing I can do.

571
00:42:16,757 --> 00:42:18,133
All right.

572
00:42:21,012 --> 00:42:22,839
I shouldn't have asked you.

573
00:42:24,974 --> 00:42:27,181
Edie, come on. Have a little beer.

574
00:42:27,853 --> 00:42:29,311
Come on.

575
00:42:31,565 --> 00:42:32,893
I don't want it.

576
00:42:37,238 --> 00:42:39,563
You just stay here and finish your drink.

577
00:42:39,657 --> 00:42:43,156
Don't go. I've got my whole life to drink.

578
00:42:48,583 --> 00:42:50,291
Are you sore at me?

579
00:42:54,256 --> 00:42:55,584
What for?

580
00:43:01,389 --> 00:43:04,010
I don't know, for not being no help to you.

581
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:11,019
You would if you could.

582
00:43:23,621 --> 00:43:25,495
Here I come.

583
00:43:25,706 --> 00:43:28,376
Pick a winner.

584
00:43:28,876 --> 00:43:31,284
First I got to kiss the bride.

585
00:43:31,379 --> 00:43:34,998
Go on, you've kissed her before!

586
00:43:43,392 --> 00:43:46,429
You can get out that way.
You want me to take you?

587
00:43:53,194 --> 00:43:56,279
- Come on. What's going on here?
- Give me a cigarette.

588
00:43:56,364 --> 00:43:58,571
You've got to stop smoking so much.

589
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:02,152
Come on, we'll get out through here.

590
00:44:03,664 --> 00:44:05,123
What's the matter?

591
00:44:11,297 --> 00:44:12,542
Come on.

592
00:44:12,632 --> 00:44:14,257
That's a pretty tune.

593
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:21,723
Here's a stick of gum. It'll do you good.

594
00:44:22,893 --> 00:44:25,265
- Thank you.
- Do you like that music?

595
00:44:32,195 --> 00:44:35,231
If I had my tuxedo,
I'd ask you to dance, but...

596
00:44:36,741 --> 00:44:38,650
Come on. You want to spin?

597
00:44:43,832 --> 00:44:45,908
Come on, don't be afraid.

598
00:44:47,127 --> 00:44:48,919
You dance divinely.

599
00:44:59,849 --> 00:45:01,557
I think we're doing pretty good.

600
00:45:02,727 --> 00:45:04,969
The sisters ought to see you now.

601
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:09,311
Wait a minute.

602
00:45:13,197 --> 00:45:15,569
I feel like I'm just floating.

603
00:45:17,034 --> 00:45:18,529
I'm just floating.

604
00:45:21,247 --> 00:45:22,658
Just floating.

605
00:45:30,549 --> 00:45:33,918
I been looking all over for you, Terry.
The boss wants you.

606
00:45:35,262 --> 00:45:36,377
Right now?

607
00:45:36,889 --> 00:45:39,511
Yeah, he just got a call
from "Mr. Upstairs."

608
00:45:40,309 --> 00:45:42,848
Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.

609
00:45:43,354 --> 00:45:45,181
I'm going to take her home first.

610
00:45:45,273 --> 00:45:48,191
I wouldn't do that.
I'll see the little lady home.

611
00:45:49,194 --> 00:45:51,650
Tell him I'll come over there
when I'm ready.

612
00:45:51,738 --> 00:45:54,609
Hey, wait up!

613
00:45:56,619 --> 00:45:57,947
Who was that?

614
00:45:59,247 --> 00:46:02,248
I don't know. Some mug.

615
00:46:04,878 --> 00:46:06,288
Who was he?

616
00:46:07,339 --> 00:46:10,838
You got to quit trying to find out
about Joey. It ain't safe.

617
00:46:10,926 --> 00:46:13,049
I'm telling you it ain't safe.

618
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:16,556
Mr. Malloy, I was hoping
I might find you here.

619
00:46:16,724 --> 00:46:17,838
Excuse me, Miss.

620
00:46:17,933 --> 00:46:20,769
You're being served with a subpoena,
Mr. Malloy.

621
00:46:21,729 --> 00:46:22,725
What?

622
00:46:22,814 --> 00:46:26,479
Be at the State House, Courtroom 9,
10:00 Friday morning.

623
00:46:27,026 --> 00:46:29,565
I told you I don't know nothing about that.

624
00:46:29,654 --> 00:46:31,528
You can bring a lawyer if you wish.

625
00:46:31,615 --> 00:46:34,735
You're privileged under the constitution
to protect yourself...

626
00:46:34,826 --> 00:46:38,326
against questions which might
implicate you in any crimes.

627
00:46:39,623 --> 00:46:41,616
You know what they're asking me to do?

628
00:46:41,709 --> 00:46:44,710
All we want you to do, Mr. Malloy,
is tell the truth.

629
00:46:46,381 --> 00:46:49,465
Goodnight, kid. Nice wedding.

630
00:46:54,181 --> 00:46:55,924
What are you going to do?

631
00:46:57,309 --> 00:47:00,761
I ain't going to eat cheese
for no cop and that's for sure.

632
00:47:05,651 --> 00:47:08,771
It was Johnny Friendly
who had Joey killed, wasn't it?

633
00:47:08,946 --> 00:47:12,067
He had him killed or
he had something to do with it, didn't he?

634
00:47:12,158 --> 00:47:14,234
He and your big brother Charley?

635
00:47:14,953 --> 00:47:18,073
You can't tell me, can you,
because you're a part of it.

636
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:21,955
Because you're just as bad as
the worst of them. Tell me the truth.

637
00:47:22,044 --> 00:47:24,713
You better go back to that school
out in daisyland.

638
00:47:24,797 --> 00:47:27,668
You're driving yourself nuts,
you're driving me nuts.

639
00:47:27,758 --> 00:47:31,424
Quit worrying about the truth all the time.
Worry about yourself.

640
00:47:32,138 --> 00:47:34,297
I should've known you wouldn't tell me.

641
00:47:34,391 --> 00:47:38,223
Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you.
I think he still owns you.

642
00:47:40,856 --> 00:47:43,098
No wonder everybody calls you a bum.

643
00:47:45,819 --> 00:47:48,524
Don't say that to me, Edie,
don't say that to me now.

644
00:47:48,614 --> 00:47:52,529
No wonder.

645
00:47:52,618 --> 00:47:54,695
I'm only trying to help you out.

646
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:58,655
I'm trying to keep you from getting hurt.
What more do you want me to do?

647
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,624
- Much more.
- Wait a minute.

648
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:02,335
Much, much, much more.

649
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,088
Where are you going?

650
00:48:34,497 --> 00:48:37,700
Hi there, Johnny,
I was just coming over there.

651
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,709
- Where were you, in Chicago?
- No, I was just on my way over there.

652
00:48:43,798 --> 00:48:46,171
How many times
you been knocked out, Terry?

653
00:48:46,259 --> 00:48:48,086
Knocked out? Two times.

654
00:48:48,387 --> 00:48:50,214
That's once too often.

655
00:48:50,305 --> 00:48:54,090
Your brains must be rattling.
What you got up there, Chinese bells?

656
00:48:54,226 --> 00:48:57,144
I thought you were gonna
keep an eye on that church meeting.

657
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:59,685
I was there. Nothing was happening.

658
00:48:59,774 --> 00:49:02,894
Nothing happening!
Some operator you got yourself there.

659
00:49:02,986 --> 00:49:05,691
One more like him,
we'd all be wearing striped pajamas.

660
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:09,695
I'm telling you, Johnny, it was a big nothing.
The priest did all the talking.

661
00:49:09,785 --> 00:49:13,368
Half an hour later, a certain
Timothy J. Dugan had a secret session...

662
00:49:13,455 --> 00:49:17,121
with the crime commission,
and he done all the talking.

663
00:49:18,336 --> 00:49:20,079
Dugan, what does he know?

664
00:49:20,463 --> 00:49:23,037
Just 39 pages of our operation, that's all.

665
00:49:25,593 --> 00:49:27,088
Where'd you get that?

666
00:49:27,178 --> 00:49:30,382
- I got it.
- The complete works of Timothy J. Dugan.

667
00:49:34,269 --> 00:49:36,262
I knew he had the guts, but I never...

668
00:49:36,355 --> 00:49:39,689
Guts! Why, that crummy pigeon.
He ought to have his neck wrung!

669
00:49:39,775 --> 00:49:43,358
That's what we get for mixing
with this punch-drunk brother of yours.

670
00:49:43,446 --> 00:49:46,020
He was good for laughs,
but this is business.

671
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:48,571
I don't like anyone goofing off
in my business.

672
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:51,578
- I wasn't...
- Why are you going around with his sister?

673
00:49:51,663 --> 00:49:53,039
Just shut up!

674
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:58,793
It's just the Doyle broad,
she's got him so he doesn't...

675
00:49:58,879 --> 00:50:00,789
know where his feet is anymore.

676
00:50:00,881 --> 00:50:02,791
It's an unhealthy relationship.

677
00:50:02,884 --> 00:50:05,968
- Definitely!
- Get rid of her...

678
00:50:06,054 --> 00:50:08,260
unless you're both tired of living.

679
00:50:08,348 --> 00:50:09,842
- You got her address?
- Yeah.

680
00:50:09,933 --> 00:50:12,305
We've got to do something
to muzzle Dugan...

681
00:50:12,394 --> 00:50:15,348
or he'll raise the biggest stink
this town's ever seen.

682
00:50:15,439 --> 00:50:17,562
We got the best muscle on the waterfront.

683
00:50:17,649 --> 00:50:20,437
The time to use it is now.
Pronto, if not sooner.

684
00:50:20,528 --> 00:50:24,478
You know where you're going? Back in
the hold. No more cushy job in the loft.

685
00:50:24,574 --> 00:50:28,488
It's down in the hold with the sweat gang
till you learn your lesson.

686
00:50:33,583 --> 00:50:34,864
Let's go.

687
00:50:35,001 --> 00:50:36,544
Wise up!

688
00:51:16,504 --> 00:51:19,375
Come on, you're all right. Let's do it.

689
00:51:19,966 --> 00:51:21,758
At last an Irish shipment.

690
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:25,711
And loaded to the gunnels
with fine Irish whiskey.

691
00:51:26,015 --> 00:51:29,016
You see, Kayo, the good Lord
takes care of us all the time.

692
00:51:29,101 --> 00:51:31,723
- That he does.
- Come on out, Kayo, get it up.

693
00:51:31,813 --> 00:51:34,185
All right, take it up. Take it away.

694
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:38,899
And don't go walking off with any of that!

695
00:51:38,987 --> 00:51:41,774
You know how the boss feels
about individual pilferage.

696
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:43,407
All right, all right.

697
00:51:43,992 --> 00:51:47,196
Now you see the advantage
of a little man in a big coat.

698
00:51:53,544 --> 00:51:56,629
- Let me see you a minute afterwards.
- What're you here for?

699
00:51:56,714 --> 00:51:59,965
To see that we don't steal
any of Mr. Friendly's precious cargo?

700
00:52:00,051 --> 00:52:02,803
- I want to talk to you.
- Get away from me, will you?

701
00:52:02,888 --> 00:52:05,260
All right. Take it up. Take it away.

702
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:21,397
Kayo, you're a walking distillery.

703
00:52:29,917 --> 00:52:31,494
Watch it!

704
00:52:33,504 --> 00:52:34,702
Get a doctor!

705
00:52:35,256 --> 00:52:37,877
He don't need a doctor. He needs a priest.

706
00:52:53,943 --> 00:52:56,149
I came down here to keep a promise.

707
00:52:56,904 --> 00:52:59,609
I gave Kayo my word
that if he stood up to the Mob...

708
00:52:59,699 --> 00:53:02,570
I'd stand up with him all the way.

709
00:53:03,703 --> 00:53:05,612
And now Kayo Dugan is dead.

710
00:53:06,289 --> 00:53:09,326
He was one of those fellows
who had the gift for standing up.

711
00:53:09,417 --> 00:53:11,209
This time they fixed him.

712
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:14,746
They fixed him for good this time,
unless it was an accident...

713
00:53:14,965 --> 00:53:16,590
like Big Mac says.

714
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:21,175
Some people think the Crucifixion
only took place on Calvary.

715
00:53:21,264 --> 00:53:23,303
They better wise up.

716
00:53:23,808 --> 00:53:27,758
Taking Joey Doyle's life to stop him
from testifying is a crucifixion.

717
00:53:29,648 --> 00:53:31,806
Dropping a sling on Kayo Dugan...

718
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:34,818
because he was ready
to spill his guts tomorrow...

719
00:53:34,903 --> 00:53:37,110
that's a crucifixion.

720
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,194
Every time the mob
puts the crusher on a good man...

721
00:53:41,285 --> 00:53:45,782
tries to stop him from doing his duty
as a citizen, it's a crucifixion.

722
00:53:45,873 --> 00:53:49,456
And anybody who sits around
and lets it happen...

723
00:53:49,544 --> 00:53:53,672
keeps silent about something he knows
has happened, shares the guilt of it...

724
00:53:53,757 --> 00:53:55,797
just as much as the Roman soldier...

725
00:53:55,884 --> 00:53:59,419
who pierced the flesh of Our Lord
to see if He was dead.

726
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:05,848
Go back to your church, Father.

727
00:54:05,937 --> 00:54:07,728
Boys, this is my church.

728
00:54:08,856 --> 00:54:11,941
If you don't think Christ is down here
on the waterfront...

729
00:54:12,026 --> 00:54:14,233
you've got another guess coming!

730
00:54:14,613 --> 00:54:16,487
Get off this dock, Father!

731
00:54:17,366 --> 00:54:18,908
Tillio, don't do that.

732
00:54:18,992 --> 00:54:21,780
- Whose side are you on, boy?
- Let him finish.

733
00:54:21,912 --> 00:54:23,406
Every morning...

734
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:28,419
when the hiring boss
blows his whistle...

735
00:54:29,378 --> 00:54:32,083
Jesus stands alongside you
in the shape-up.

736
00:54:32,173 --> 00:54:35,673
He sees why some of you get picked
and some of you get passed over.

737
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,715
He sees the family men worrying
about getting their rent...

738
00:54:38,805 --> 00:54:41,213
and getting food for the wife and kids.

739
00:54:41,308 --> 00:54:44,594
He sees you selling your souls
to the mob for a day's pay.

740
00:54:45,729 --> 00:54:48,268
The next bum that throws something
deals with me!

741
00:54:48,357 --> 00:54:50,315
I don't care if he's twice my size!

742
00:54:50,401 --> 00:54:52,857
What does Christ think
of the easy-money boys...

743
00:54:52,946 --> 00:54:55,437
who do none of the work
and take all the gravy?

744
00:54:55,532 --> 00:54:58,486
How does he feel about
the fellows who wear $150 suits...

745
00:54:58,577 --> 00:55:02,824
and diamond rings on your union dues
and your kickback money?

746
00:55:03,916 --> 00:55:08,163
And how does He, who spoke up
without fear against every evil...

747
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:10,838
feel about your silence?

748
00:55:10,923 --> 00:55:12,631
Shut up about that!

749
00:55:12,758 --> 00:55:14,336
Just watch this.

750
00:55:19,933 --> 00:55:21,131
You see that?

751
00:55:21,226 --> 00:55:23,800
You want to know what's wrong
with our waterfront?

752
00:55:23,895 --> 00:55:27,596
It's the love of a lousy buck. It's
making love of a buck, the cushy job...

753
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:29,731
more important than the love of man.

754
00:55:29,818 --> 00:55:33,270
It's forgetting that every fellow
down here is your brother in Christ.

755
00:55:33,364 --> 00:55:35,440
But remember, Christ is always with you.

756
00:55:35,533 --> 00:55:38,404
Christ's in the shape-up,
in the hatch, in the union hall.

757
00:55:38,494 --> 00:55:42,279
He's kneeling right here beside Dugan
and He's saying with all of you:

758
00:55:44,126 --> 00:55:47,127
"If you do it to the least of mine,
you do it to me."

759
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:50,206
What they did to Joey and to Dugan...

760
00:55:50,299 --> 00:55:53,917
they're doing to you and you.

761
00:55:55,096 --> 00:55:56,210
All of you!

762
00:55:57,682 --> 00:56:01,383
And only you, only you with God's help...

763
00:56:01,478 --> 00:56:04,265
have the power
to knock them out for good.

764
00:56:11,447 --> 00:56:13,238
Okay, Kayo.

765
00:56:28,381 --> 00:56:29,413
Amen.

766
00:56:33,637 --> 00:56:37,766
All right. Come on. Let's go. Break it up.
Let's go to work.

767
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:57,318
Edie, here's Joey's jacket. I'm sure Kayo
would wish you to have it back.

768
00:58:15,372 --> 00:58:17,281
I brought you Joey's jacket.

769
00:58:18,083 --> 00:58:19,707
Yours is coming apart.

770
00:58:25,799 --> 00:58:26,914
Pigeons.

771
00:58:29,095 --> 00:58:30,553
They're nervous.

772
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:33,506
There was a hawk around here before.

773
00:59:18,398 --> 00:59:20,853
Father, I want to speak to you a minute.

774
00:59:22,819 --> 00:59:24,611
Remember what you said about...

775
00:59:24,696 --> 00:59:27,946
Kayo Dugan and keeping
your mouth shut when you know the score.

776
00:59:28,033 --> 00:59:29,990
I don't want to hear your confession.

777
00:59:30,077 --> 00:59:33,529
I'll dig it out for myself
and use it where it'll do the most good.

778
00:59:33,622 --> 00:59:36,789
- Father Gregory will hear you.
- I don't want to talk...

779
00:59:49,932 --> 00:59:51,759
Wait a second, wait a minute.

780
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:54,223
I just want to talk to you one second.

781
00:59:55,437 --> 00:59:57,264
You've got to listen to me.

782
00:59:57,648 --> 01:00:00,649
I'm the one that set Joey Doyle up
for the knock off.

783
01:00:08,952 --> 01:00:12,404
Come on, take a walk with me, kid,
and give it to me straight.

784
01:00:15,751 --> 01:00:18,325
There's nothing I haven't heard. Come on.

785
01:00:31,393 --> 01:00:33,184
It started out as a favor.

786
01:00:33,312 --> 01:00:36,147
Favor, who am I kidding?
It's "do it or else."

787
01:00:36,231 --> 01:00:38,901
Believe me when I tell you
I just thought they were...

788
01:00:39,026 --> 01:00:42,395
going to lean on him a bit.
I never thought he'd get knocked off.

789
01:00:42,488 --> 01:00:44,397
I tried to tell Edie the other night.

790
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:46,566
I really tried to, I wanted to tell her.

791
01:00:46,659 --> 01:00:49,744
She's the first nice thing
that's ever happened to me.

792
01:00:50,288 --> 01:00:52,115
What are you going to do about it?

793
01:00:52,207 --> 01:00:54,247
What do you mean? About telling her?

794
01:00:54,334 --> 01:00:57,501
Yes, about telling her.
The commission. Your subpoena.

795
01:00:57,588 --> 01:00:59,130
I know you got a subpoena.

796
01:00:59,214 --> 01:01:00,460
I don't know.

797
01:01:01,091 --> 01:01:03,583
It's like carrying a monkey
around on your back.

798
01:01:03,678 --> 01:01:05,836
It's a question of "who rides who."

799
01:01:06,848 --> 01:01:09,386
If I spill, my life ain't worth a nickel.

800
01:01:09,684 --> 01:01:12,354
And how much is your soul worth
if you don't?

801
01:01:13,229 --> 01:01:16,350
They're asking me to put the finger
on my own brother.

802
01:01:17,567 --> 01:01:20,853
Johnny Friendly used to take me
to ball games when I was a kid.

803
01:01:20,946 --> 01:01:22,524
Don't break my heart.

804
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:26,573
I wouldn't care if he gave you
a life pass to the polo grounds.

805
01:01:26,744 --> 01:01:29,662
So you've got a brother.
Let me tell you something...

806
01:01:29,747 --> 01:01:32,417
you've got other brothers
getting the short hand...

807
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:36,166
while Johnny is getting mustard
on his face at the polo grounds.

808
01:01:36,254 --> 01:01:37,168
Ball games.

809
01:01:37,255 --> 01:01:40,007
Listen, if I were you,
I would walk right...

810
01:01:42,344 --> 01:01:43,459
Never mind.

811
01:01:44,138 --> 01:01:48,385
I'm not asking you to do anything,
your own conscience has to do the asking.

812
01:01:48,684 --> 01:01:49,847
Conscience.

813
01:01:51,896 --> 01:01:54,601
- That stuff can drive you nuts.
- Good luck.

814
01:01:55,859 --> 01:01:57,851
Is that all you've got to say?

815
01:01:59,654 --> 01:02:00,769
Come here.

816
01:02:04,535 --> 01:02:06,444
Edie called me this morning.

817
01:02:06,912 --> 01:02:08,988
She's coming here to talk to me.

818
01:02:11,292 --> 01:02:13,368
Come on, why don't you tell her?

819
01:02:15,713 --> 01:02:16,828
No curves.

820
01:02:20,886 --> 01:02:22,000
Okay.

821
01:02:24,473 --> 01:02:25,635
Thanks.

822
01:03:04,015 --> 01:03:06,138
- You?
- Honest to God, Edie...

823
01:03:16,904 --> 01:03:19,146
Believe me, I swear to God, Edie...

824
01:04:13,006 --> 01:04:15,332
Terry, guess who's here?

825
01:04:15,425 --> 01:04:18,261
That joker
from the crime commissioner's office.

826
01:04:39,284 --> 01:04:41,776
Suppose I knew a guy
that knocked somebody off...

827
01:04:41,871 --> 01:04:43,780
you think I ought to turn him in?

828
01:04:43,873 --> 01:04:46,245
You mean call a cop? Are you kidding?

829
01:04:46,334 --> 01:04:48,373
You don't think I ought to turn him in?

830
01:04:48,461 --> 01:04:50,454
You was a Golden Warrior once.

831
01:04:51,381 --> 01:04:52,626
That's right.

832
01:04:54,676 --> 01:04:56,254
You started the gang.

833
01:05:18,994 --> 01:05:20,488
You looking for me?

834
01:05:20,787 --> 01:05:23,872
No, not exactly.
I was just resting my dogs a minute.

835
01:05:24,166 --> 01:05:28,627
On the next investigation we get, I hope
it's got buildings with elevators in them.

836
01:05:28,713 --> 01:05:31,382
So far this one's just
been climbing stairs.

837
01:05:31,966 --> 01:05:33,793
What do you climb them for?

838
01:05:33,927 --> 01:05:36,762
It's worth it if we can tell
the waterfront story...

839
01:05:36,846 --> 01:05:39,338
the way the people
have a right to hear it.

840
01:05:39,432 --> 01:05:40,808
Don't you think?

841
01:06:00,121 --> 01:06:02,992
Didn't I see you in the Garden
three or four years ago...

842
01:06:03,083 --> 01:06:05,076
with a fellow named Wilson?

843
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:10,120
I thought you were going
to take him that night.

844
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:12,007
Man, he really dumped you.

845
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:15,048
He dumped me?

846
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:22,431
What would you say if I told you
I held that bum up for half a round?

847
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:25,761
I could see he was hurt.

848
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:30,185
What did you think I was doing
with them combinations, petting him?

849
01:06:30,279 --> 01:06:32,106
You just couldn't finish him off?

850
01:06:32,198 --> 01:06:33,989
Don't monkey around there.

851
01:06:34,909 --> 01:06:36,652
Why didn't you finish him off?

852
01:06:36,744 --> 01:06:40,576
- I was doing a favor for some pals.
- Favor?

853
01:06:42,625 --> 01:06:44,084
That's the way it was.

854
01:06:44,169 --> 01:06:45,793
That's the way it was.

855
01:06:45,879 --> 01:06:48,631
If I'd have put him down,
I'd have had a title shot.

856
01:06:48,715 --> 01:06:50,210
I was ready that night.

857
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:53,171
You sure looked it.
That's when I figured it was all over.

858
01:06:53,262 --> 01:06:55,835
It was all over, except for the lousy bet!

859
01:06:56,015 --> 01:06:57,260
- My own.
- Yeah.

860
01:07:03,022 --> 01:07:04,980
I guess I'd better get going.

861
01:07:05,442 --> 01:07:07,150
Hit those stairs again.

862
01:07:09,654 --> 01:07:13,439
Was that a hook or an uppercut
you caught him with that first time?

863
01:07:14,535 --> 01:07:17,322
I didn't use no hooks.
I was strictly a short puncher.

864
01:07:17,413 --> 01:07:19,037
It looked like a hook to me.

865
01:07:19,123 --> 01:07:22,575
I had that bum all figured out.
He had a good left hand.

866
01:07:22,668 --> 01:07:25,789
I let him tag me with the left
hand for a couple of rounds...

867
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:29,925
so just when he starts, he thinks
he's getting cute, I step inside a jab...

868
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:32,418
with a left, with a right, with a left.

869
01:07:32,512 --> 01:07:36,047
I had him in my arms
and from there on in we were just dancing.

870
01:07:36,141 --> 01:07:37,600
And that's a fact!

871
01:07:38,102 --> 01:07:41,886
When those guys want to win a bet,
there's nothing they won't stop at.

872
01:07:45,568 --> 01:07:47,110
I didn't hear them, boss...

873
01:07:47,195 --> 01:07:49,864
but I seen them nose to nose,
like pair of lovers.

874
01:07:49,948 --> 01:07:51,656
The flatfoot was eating it up.

875
01:07:51,741 --> 01:07:54,826
So they've been seen together
and he smiled at her.

876
01:07:54,911 --> 01:07:56,869
That doesn't mean he's going to talk.

877
01:07:56,955 --> 01:08:00,075
There is no evidence
until he gives public testimony.

878
01:08:00,167 --> 01:08:02,493
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley.

879
01:08:02,962 --> 01:08:05,085
That's what we kept you around here for.

880
01:08:05,173 --> 01:08:07,545
How do we keep him
from giving this testimony?

881
01:08:07,634 --> 01:08:11,085
Ain't that what you call
"the main order of business"?

882
01:08:11,179 --> 01:08:12,554
He's a good kid.

883
01:08:12,764 --> 01:08:14,342
- You know that.
- He's a bum.

884
01:08:14,432 --> 01:08:17,683
After all the days I gave him in the loft,
he's got no gratitude.

885
01:08:17,769 --> 01:08:18,849
Shut up!

886
01:08:20,105 --> 01:08:22,478
I'm conducting this investigation.

887
01:08:25,945 --> 01:08:28,436
This girl and the father,
they got their hooks...

888
01:08:28,531 --> 01:08:32,114
in the kid so deep he doesn't
even know which end is up any more.

889
01:08:32,202 --> 01:08:34,574
I ain't interested in his mental condition.

890
01:08:34,663 --> 01:08:37,830
All I want to know is:
is he D and D or is he a canary?

891
01:08:40,544 --> 01:08:43,165
- I wish I knew.
- So do I, Charley.

892
01:08:44,215 --> 01:08:45,460
For your sake.

893
01:08:52,181 --> 01:08:53,640
What do you want me to do?

894
01:08:53,725 --> 01:08:56,809
It's simple. Drive him out
to this place we've been using...

895
01:08:56,895 --> 01:09:00,940
try to straighten him out on the way.
If you don't, give him to Gerry G.

896
01:09:01,024 --> 01:09:02,483
You can't do that.

897
01:09:03,277 --> 01:09:07,227
Maybe the boy is out of line,
but he's just a confused kid!

898
01:09:07,323 --> 01:09:08,817
Confused kid!

899
01:09:12,161 --> 01:09:15,032
First he crosses me in public
and gets away with it...

900
01:09:15,123 --> 01:09:18,622
then the next joker, pretty soon
I'm just another fellow around here!

901
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:20,750
Johnny, I can't do that.

902
01:09:25,801 --> 01:09:26,964
Then don't.

903
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:40,351
- Who do you like in the third?
- It's got to be New Hope.

904
01:09:40,442 --> 01:09:41,604
Definitely.

905
01:09:45,739 --> 01:09:46,818
Johnny...

906
01:09:48,534 --> 01:09:50,194
it's my kid brother.

907
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:52,243
That's for you to figure out.

908
01:09:52,329 --> 01:09:54,951
You can have it your way
or you can have it his way...

909
01:09:55,041 --> 01:09:57,662
but you can't have it both ways.
Am I right, Truck?

910
01:09:57,752 --> 01:09:58,915
Definitely.

911
01:10:00,755 --> 01:10:02,380
Okay, on your horse...

912
01:10:04,259 --> 01:10:05,634
deep thinker.

913
01:10:37,503 --> 01:10:38,369
Hi, Charley.

914
01:10:38,963 --> 01:10:42,498
I'm glad you stopped by for me.
I've been wanting to talk to you.

915
01:10:42,592 --> 01:10:44,170
- Sure, kid.
- Where to?

916
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:46,668
Go to River St. I'll
tell you where to stop.

917
01:10:46,763 --> 01:10:48,756
I thought we was going to the Garden?

918
01:10:48,849 --> 01:10:51,470
We are, but I want to cover a bet
on the way over.

919
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:54,229
Besides, this'll give us a chance to talk.

920
01:10:54,855 --> 01:10:57,560
Nobody ever stopped you
from talking, Charley.

921
01:11:00,987 --> 01:11:03,560
The grapevine says that
you got a subpoena.

922
01:11:04,782 --> 01:11:07,024
The guys know you're not a cheese-eater.

923
01:11:07,118 --> 01:11:09,906
They think you shouldn't be
on the outside so much...

924
01:11:09,996 --> 01:11:13,829
but a little on the inside.
I have a few things for you at the docks.

925
01:11:15,002 --> 01:11:16,282
A steady job...

926
01:11:16,879 --> 01:11:19,631
a couple extra potatoes,
that's all I want.

927
01:11:20,216 --> 01:11:22,255
That's great when you're a kid, but...

928
01:11:22,343 --> 01:11:25,012
you're getting on,
you're pushing 30, slugger.

929
01:11:25,096 --> 01:11:28,299
You know it's time to think
about getting some ambition.

930
01:11:30,310 --> 01:11:33,596
I always figured I'd live
a little bit longer without it.

931
01:11:36,024 --> 01:11:37,353
Maybe.

932
01:11:43,991 --> 01:11:48,203
There's a boss loader slot that's
open on the new pier we're opening up.

933
01:11:49,372 --> 01:11:51,780
It pays six cents on every...

934
01:11:52,125 --> 01:11:55,708
100 pounds that goes in
and every 100 pounds that goes out...

935
01:11:55,796 --> 01:11:57,788
and you don't have to lift a finger.

936
01:11:57,881 --> 01:12:00,586
That's $200, $300, $400 a week.

937
01:12:00,801 --> 01:12:03,672
$400 a week just for the openers.

938
01:12:04,388 --> 01:12:06,879
I get all that dough for not doing nothing?

939
01:12:06,974 --> 01:12:09,845
You don't do anything
and you don't say anything.

940
01:12:10,687 --> 01:12:11,967
You understand?

941
01:12:17,611 --> 01:12:20,280
There's more to this
than I thought, Charley.

942
01:12:21,532 --> 01:12:23,738
I'm telling you there's a lot more.

943
01:12:24,827 --> 01:12:28,492
You're not thinking of testifying against
some people that we might know?

944
01:12:28,581 --> 01:12:30,205
I don't know, Charley.

945
01:12:30,917 --> 01:12:33,159
That's what I want to talk to you about.

946
01:12:33,253 --> 01:12:37,203
Do you know how much the piers are
worth that we control through the local?

947
01:12:37,299 --> 01:12:40,335
Do you think Johnny's going to jeopardize
the whole set-up...

948
01:12:40,427 --> 01:12:44,591
for one rubber-lipped, ex-tanker
who's walking on his heels? What the...

949
01:12:44,681 --> 01:12:46,674
I could've been a lot better.

950
01:12:46,767 --> 01:12:48,890
The point is we don't have much time!

951
01:12:48,978 --> 01:12:51,516
I'm telling you,
I haven't made up my mind yet!

952
01:12:51,606 --> 01:12:54,642
Make up your mind
before we get to 437 River St!

953
01:13:02,868 --> 01:13:04,944
Before we get to where, Charley?

954
01:13:10,417 --> 01:13:13,953
Listen, Terry.
Take the job, no questions. Take it!

955
01:13:16,716 --> 01:13:18,839
Terry, take this job, please.

956
01:13:50,252 --> 01:13:51,497
Look, kid...

957
01:13:55,716 --> 01:13:57,709
How much do you weigh, slugger?

958
01:13:59,721 --> 01:14:02,426
When you weighed 168 pounds...

959
01:14:03,767 --> 01:14:05,391
you were beautiful.

960
01:14:07,521 --> 01:14:09,928
You could have been another Billy Conn.

961
01:14:12,192 --> 01:14:14,434
That skunk we got you for a manager...

962
01:14:15,654 --> 01:14:17,647
he brought you along too fast.

963
01:14:19,784 --> 01:14:22,322
It wasn't him, Charley. It was you.

964
01:14:22,453 --> 01:14:24,245
Remember that night in the Garden?

965
01:14:24,330 --> 01:14:28,245
You came down to my dressing room
and said, "Kid, this ain't your night.

966
01:14:28,335 --> 01:14:30,577
"We're going for the price on Wilson."

967
01:14:31,421 --> 01:14:32,880
You remember that?

968
01:14:33,966 --> 01:14:35,590
"This ain't your night."

969
01:14:36,468 --> 01:14:39,386
My night! I could have taken Wilson apart!

970
01:14:40,765 --> 01:14:44,098
So what happens, he gets the title shot
outdoors in the ball park...

971
01:14:44,185 --> 01:14:47,352
and what do I get?
A one-way ticket to Palookaville!

972
01:14:47,438 --> 01:14:49,182
You was my brother, Charley.

973
01:14:49,274 --> 01:14:51,847
You should have looked out
for me a little bit.

974
01:14:51,943 --> 01:14:54,779
You should've taken care of me
a little so I wouldn't...

975
01:14:54,863 --> 01:14:57,271
have to take dives for short-end money.

976
01:14:57,366 --> 01:14:59,857
I had some bets down for you.
You saw some money.

977
01:14:59,952 --> 01:15:02,704
You don't understand,
I could have had class!

978
01:15:02,788 --> 01:15:04,781
I could have been a contender.

979
01:15:04,999 --> 01:15:06,826
I could have been somebody.

980
01:15:07,961 --> 01:15:09,455
Instead of a bum...

981
01:15:10,004 --> 01:15:12,377
which is what I am. Let's face it.

982
01:15:17,554 --> 01:15:19,097
It was you, Charley!

983
01:15:26,564 --> 01:15:27,595
Okay.

984
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:33,147
I'll tell them...

985
01:15:34,447 --> 01:15:36,274
I couldn't find you.

986
01:15:36,366 --> 01:15:38,525
Ten to one they won't believe me.

987
01:15:44,834 --> 01:15:46,328
Here, you take this.

988
01:15:48,045 --> 01:15:49,753
You're going to need it.

989
01:15:51,716 --> 01:15:52,997
You, pull over.

990
01:16:03,395 --> 01:16:05,020
Take me to the Garden.

991
01:16:44,690 --> 01:16:46,433
Stay away from me!

992
01:16:52,114 --> 01:16:52,980
Edie?

993
01:16:55,076 --> 01:16:57,401
Come on, open the door, please!

994
01:16:57,495 --> 01:16:58,526
Stop it!

995
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:03,958
I want you to stay away from me.

996
01:17:04,044 --> 01:17:07,247
I know what you want me to do
but I ain't doing it, so forget it.

997
01:17:07,339 --> 01:17:09,415
I don't want you to do anything.

998
01:17:09,550 --> 01:17:11,922
You let your conscience
tell you what to do.

999
01:17:12,011 --> 01:17:15,012
Shut up about that conscience,
that's all I've been hearing!

1000
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:18,513
I never mentioned the word before.
You just stay away from me!

1001
01:17:18,601 --> 01:17:20,345
Edie, you love me.

1002
01:17:21,354 --> 01:17:25,138
I didn't say I didn't love you,
I said stay away from me!

1003
01:17:25,233 --> 01:17:28,069
- I want you to stay with me.
- Stay away from me!

1004
01:18:02,315 --> 01:18:03,726
Terry!

1005
01:18:05,401 --> 01:18:10,111
Terry, your brother's down here!
He wants to see you!

1006
01:18:12,534 --> 01:18:13,565
Charley?

1007
01:18:23,921 --> 01:18:25,713
Your brother's down here.

1008
01:18:26,799 --> 01:18:28,294
Come on down here.

1009
01:18:28,551 --> 01:18:30,094
He wants to see you.

1010
01:18:34,599 --> 01:18:35,975
Come on down!

1011
01:18:37,561 --> 01:18:40,348
- What is it Terry?
- Charley, he's in trouble.

1012
01:18:40,523 --> 01:18:41,685
Be careful.

1013
01:18:49,449 --> 01:18:50,480
Charley!

1014
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:52,274
Terry?

1015
01:18:53,245 --> 01:18:57,706
Terry! Your brother's down here!

1016
01:19:00,085 --> 01:19:01,877
Do you hear what I hear?

1017
01:19:03,798 --> 01:19:04,829
Terry!

1018
01:19:19,106 --> 01:19:22,475
That's the same way they called Andy,
the night I lost him.

1019
01:19:23,027 --> 01:19:25,696
Edie, be careful! Edie, be careful!

1020
01:21:21,362 --> 01:21:22,773
They got Charley.

1021
01:21:23,239 --> 01:21:26,027
Terry, I'm frightened.
Let's get out of here, please.

1022
01:21:26,117 --> 01:21:29,118
First Joey, then Dugan,
and now Charley, and next...

1023
01:21:29,454 --> 01:21:32,124
Please, Terry,
some place where we can live in peace.

1024
01:21:32,207 --> 01:21:35,125
I'm going to take it out of their skulls.

1025
01:21:39,006 --> 01:21:40,121
Charley...

1026
01:21:43,177 --> 01:21:45,847
I'm going to take it
out of their skulls.

1027
01:21:46,055 --> 01:21:48,048
Terry, they'll kill you, too.

1028
01:21:48,641 --> 01:21:51,678
Go get the father.
Tell him to take care of Charley.

1029
01:21:52,479 --> 01:21:55,564
And then come back here
and stay with him till he gets here.

1030
01:21:55,649 --> 01:21:58,436
Terry, please don't do anything, please!

1031
01:22:00,404 --> 01:22:03,239
For God's sake,
don't leave him alone here long!

1032
01:22:05,368 --> 01:22:07,574
- Please, Terry.
- Do what I tell you.

1033
01:22:32,689 --> 01:22:35,262
- Where's John Friendly?
- He's not here now.

1034
01:23:13,524 --> 01:23:14,805
Give me a shot.

1035
01:23:15,568 --> 01:23:16,683
Take it easy.

1036
01:23:16,778 --> 01:23:19,316
Don't give me no advice, give me the shot.

1037
01:23:24,995 --> 01:23:27,569
Why don't you go home
before Big John gets here?

1038
01:23:27,665 --> 01:23:29,408
Just give me a whiskey.

1039
01:23:36,216 --> 01:23:38,089
Stick around, Tillio.

1040
01:23:43,974 --> 01:23:45,349
There, sit down.

1041
01:23:56,738 --> 01:23:58,647
Get out of that phone booth!

1042
01:24:21,014 --> 01:24:22,923
Stay where you are!

1043
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:32,017
I want to see you, Terry.

1044
01:24:32,234 --> 01:24:34,026
I'm right in front of you.

1045
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:40,149
Don't give me a hard time, Terry.

1046
01:24:45,165 --> 01:24:46,576
What do you want?

1047
01:24:49,378 --> 01:24:50,492
Your gun.

1048
01:24:50,629 --> 01:24:52,254
Go and chase yourself.

1049
01:24:52,339 --> 01:24:53,418
Give me the gun.

1050
01:24:53,507 --> 01:24:54,752
You go to hell.

1051
01:24:56,802 --> 01:24:58,795
- What did you say?
- Go to hell.

1052
01:25:03,935 --> 01:25:06,936
- Sorry, let me help you up.
- Get your hands off me!

1053
01:25:07,063 --> 01:25:08,937
Now what am I going to do?

1054
01:25:09,024 --> 01:25:11,941
You want to be a brave man
by firing lead into another man?

1055
01:25:12,027 --> 01:25:14,483
- It's none of your business!
- That's being brave!

1056
01:25:14,571 --> 01:25:16,030
Mind your own business!

1057
01:25:16,115 --> 01:25:18,191
Shooting a man isn't being brave!

1058
01:25:18,284 --> 01:25:19,826
It's none of your business!

1059
01:25:19,910 --> 01:25:22,152
Do you want to hurt Johnny Friendly?

1060
01:25:23,581 --> 01:25:25,289
Do you want to fix him?

1061
01:25:25,792 --> 01:25:28,461
- Do you really want to finish him?
- What do you think?

1062
01:25:28,545 --> 01:25:31,036
For what he did to Charley
and a dozen other men?

1063
01:25:31,131 --> 01:25:35,211
Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here
in the jungle. That's what he wants.

1064
01:25:35,302 --> 01:25:38,173
He'll hit you in the head
and plead self-defense.

1065
01:25:38,472 --> 01:25:41,557
You'll fight him in the courtroom
tomorrow with the truth.

1066
01:25:41,642 --> 01:25:43,220
As you know the truth.

1067
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:53,694
Now you get rid of that gun.

1068
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:57,315
Unless you haven't the guts,
and if you haven't, hold onto it!

1069
01:26:02,289 --> 01:26:03,570
Give me a beer.

1070
01:26:13,510 --> 01:26:15,633
Do you want a beer? Make it two.

1071
01:26:55,597 --> 01:26:58,717
You mean to sit there and tell me
that your local takes in...

1072
01:26:58,808 --> 01:27:01,893
$65,500 every year...

1073
01:27:02,437 --> 01:27:04,477
and keeps no financial records?

1074
01:27:04,565 --> 01:27:06,308
Sure. We got records.

1075
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:07,680
Where are they?

1076
01:27:07,985 --> 01:27:11,070
We was robbed last night,
and we can't find no books.

1077
01:27:12,114 --> 01:27:14,273
- You know you're under oath?
- Sure.

1078
01:27:23,251 --> 01:27:26,288
Isn't it odd to you that
five different waterfront locals...

1079
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:28,372
were broken into last night?

1080
01:27:28,465 --> 01:27:32,380
And the only item missing from all
of them was the financial records?

1081
01:27:32,470 --> 01:27:35,590
What do you mean, odd?
Like I told you, we was robbed.

1082
01:27:41,813 --> 01:27:43,391
That's all for now.

1083
01:27:48,403 --> 01:27:50,028
Call the next witness.

1084
01:27:51,824 --> 01:27:53,651
Before you call the next witness...

1085
01:27:53,742 --> 01:27:57,361
are all the officers of Local 374
present this morning?

1086
01:27:59,332 --> 01:28:02,618
Will the following please rise
as their names are called?

1087
01:28:03,002 --> 01:28:06,621
Mr. Michael J. Skelly,
also known as Johnny Friendly, President.

1088
01:28:08,842 --> 01:28:11,167
Mr. Lewis O. Janotta, Vice President.

1089
01:28:12,554 --> 01:28:15,840
Mr. Daniel D. Coogan, Financial Secretary.

1090
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:18,759
Mr. Mladen Sokolivitch, Delegate.

1091
01:28:19,061 --> 01:28:21,303
Mr. Tillio A. Rodelli, Delegate.

1092
01:28:21,397 --> 01:28:23,224
Recording Secretary.

1093
01:28:28,071 --> 01:28:29,186
Thank you, gentlemen.

1094
01:28:29,281 --> 01:28:31,273
- Next witness.
- Mr. Malloy.

1095
01:28:43,254 --> 01:28:44,665
Raise your right hand.

1096
01:28:44,756 --> 01:28:47,128
- Name, please.
- Terry Malloy.

1097
01:28:47,217 --> 01:28:50,087
Swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,
and only the truth?

1098
01:28:50,178 --> 01:28:51,008
- Right.
- I do.

1099
01:28:51,513 --> 01:28:52,924
- I do.
- Be seated, please.

1100
01:28:54,725 --> 01:28:56,100
Mr. Malloy...

1101
01:28:56,685 --> 01:28:59,722
is it true that the night Joey Doyle
was found dead...

1102
01:28:59,814 --> 01:29:03,397
you were the last one to see him
before he was pushed from the roof?

1103
01:29:03,484 --> 01:29:04,563
Yes.

1104
01:29:04,652 --> 01:29:06,561
Is it true you went immediately...

1105
01:29:06,654 --> 01:29:09,027
Wait! Except for the guys
that pushed him off.

1106
01:29:09,115 --> 01:29:11,867
Is it true you went
immediately to the Friendly bar...

1107
01:29:11,952 --> 01:29:15,652
and expressed your feelings
about the murder to Mr. Johnny Friendly?

1108
01:29:15,747 --> 01:29:17,123
John Friendly, right.

1109
01:29:17,207 --> 01:29:18,452
<i>Mr. Malloy...</i>

1110
01:29:18,917 --> 01:29:22,536
<i>can you tell me whether Mr. Friendly,
or I should say, Mr. Skelly...</i>

1111
01:29:22,630 --> 01:29:26,794
<i>said anything to you to indicate his
responsibility in getting rid of Joey Doyle?</i>

1112
01:29:26,884 --> 01:29:27,666
<i>Right.</i>

1113
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:30,964
<i>Would you say
that Mr. Friendly made it clear to you...</i>

1114
01:29:31,097 --> 01:29:34,217
<i>it was absolutely necessary
he murder Joey Doyle in order...</i>

1115
01:29:34,309 --> 01:29:36,053
<i>to maintain his control...</i>

1116
01:29:36,144 --> 01:29:39,478
<i>on the docks of the waterfront locals!
Is that correct?</i>

1117
01:29:39,565 --> 01:29:41,273
Will there be anything else?

1118
01:29:41,358 --> 01:29:44,194
Yes, Sidney, if Mr. Friendly
calls, I'm out.

1119
01:29:44,904 --> 01:29:47,477
- Anytime today?
- If he calls ever, I'm out!

1120
01:29:47,657 --> 01:29:48,771
Very well.

1121
01:29:49,742 --> 01:29:51,450
Thank you, Mr. Malloy.

1122
01:29:52,162 --> 01:29:54,997
You've done more
than break the Joey Doyle case.

1123
01:29:56,791 --> 01:30:00,125
We've begun to make it possible
for honest men to work the docks...

1124
01:30:00,212 --> 01:30:02,620
with job security and peace of mind.

1125
01:30:04,675 --> 01:30:07,083
You may step down. That's all for now.

1126
01:30:08,638 --> 01:30:10,630
Mr. Michael J. Skelly, please.

1127
01:30:21,902 --> 01:30:24,191
You just dug your own grave. Go fall in it.

1128
01:30:24,279 --> 01:30:26,949
You're dead on this waterfront
and every waterfront...

1129
01:30:27,032 --> 01:30:28,740
from Boston to New Orleans.

1130
01:30:28,826 --> 01:30:30,783
You don't drive a truck or a cab...

1131
01:30:30,870 --> 01:30:34,820
you don't push a baggage rack
you don't work no place, you're dead!

1132
01:30:52,727 --> 01:30:56,012
Will you quit following me?
Why don't you get off my tail?

1133
01:30:56,105 --> 01:30:59,225
Orders. You're hot.
You ought to be glad we're following you.

1134
01:30:59,317 --> 01:31:00,942
You're making me feel like a canary.

1135
01:31:01,027 --> 01:31:02,356
- Well...
- Lay off.

1136
01:31:05,866 --> 01:31:07,241
Hi, Cheeky.

1137
01:31:09,662 --> 01:31:11,405
Who's your friend?

1138
01:31:44,699 --> 01:31:47,819
I made some hot coffee.
I thought you might want some.

1139
01:31:52,166 --> 01:31:53,909
Anyway, it's all over.

1140
01:31:55,586 --> 01:31:57,828
My friends don't want to talk to me.

1141
01:31:58,005 --> 01:32:00,164
Are you sure they're your friends?

1142
01:32:08,183 --> 01:32:09,677
I'll see you later.

1143
01:32:25,827 --> 01:32:27,701
Hey, champ, how's the kid.

1144
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:33,209
What's with him?

1145
01:32:48,351 --> 01:32:50,427
A pigeon for a pigeon!

1146
01:33:20,719 --> 01:33:21,750
Terry.

1147
01:33:38,071 --> 01:33:39,067
The kid.

1148
01:33:42,451 --> 01:33:43,482
Tommy?

1149
01:33:46,288 --> 01:33:48,364
What did he have to do that for?

1150
01:33:50,251 --> 01:33:51,710
Every one of them.

1151
01:33:53,171 --> 01:33:56,920
Terry, there's no place that's safe
for you now on the waterfront.

1152
01:33:57,717 --> 01:33:58,998
Maybe inland...

1153
01:33:59,427 --> 01:34:01,171
out west some place...

1154
01:34:01,263 --> 01:34:02,377
a farm.

1155
01:34:03,640 --> 01:34:04,672
A farm?

1156
01:34:05,184 --> 01:34:09,478
You could do anything, as long as
you're away from Johnny Friendly.

1157
01:34:09,563 --> 01:34:11,852
You tried to help the longshoremen...

1158
01:34:11,941 --> 01:34:15,357
and they just turn their backs
and stick to their stupid D and D!

1159
01:34:15,445 --> 01:34:18,648
Are they taking chances for you?
Why should you?

1160
01:34:18,948 --> 01:34:21,487
You're not even listening to me, are you?

1161
01:34:29,543 --> 01:34:31,251
You're going down there.

1162
01:34:32,088 --> 01:34:35,836
Just because Johnny Friendly warned you
not to, you're going down there.

1163
01:34:35,925 --> 01:34:39,626
You think you got to prove
that you're not afraid of them!

1164
01:34:39,721 --> 01:34:41,714
Well, go ahead, get it over with.

1165
01:34:41,806 --> 01:34:44,973
Go down and get yourself killed
you stupid, pigheaded...

1166
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:47,136
What are you trying to prove?

1167
01:34:50,399 --> 01:34:52,356
They always said I was a bum.

1168
01:34:54,236 --> 01:34:56,028
Well, I ain't a bum, Edie.

1169
01:34:57,448 --> 01:35:00,022
Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt nobody.

1170
01:35:00,577 --> 01:35:02,735
I'm just going to go down there...

1171
01:35:03,163 --> 01:35:04,740
and get my rights.

1172
01:35:51,548 --> 01:35:53,624
Everybody works today!

1173
01:36:12,612 --> 01:36:13,644
Wolfgang.

1174
01:36:14,865 --> 01:36:15,980
Hendricks.

1175
01:36:16,825 --> 01:36:18,023
Padowski.

1176
01:36:19,411 --> 01:36:20,443
Martin.

1177
01:36:21,372 --> 01:36:22,403
Dalton.

1178
01:36:22,665 --> 01:36:23,696
Wurthy.

1179
01:36:24,417 --> 01:36:25,496
Hauffman.

1180
01:36:27,962 --> 01:36:31,581
- What do you think?
- That ain't such a bad picture of you, boss.

1181
01:36:31,716 --> 01:36:34,042
Stop breathing that clam sauce on me.

1182
01:36:35,262 --> 01:36:38,014
I wish you'd let me
go to work on that cheese-eater.

1183
01:36:38,098 --> 01:36:39,842
I'd top the bum off lovely.

1184
01:36:39,933 --> 01:36:42,140
Wait'll we get off this front page.

1185
01:36:42,228 --> 01:36:43,508
Then he's mine.

1186
01:36:44,313 --> 01:36:45,476
I want him.

1187
01:36:46,566 --> 01:36:48,357
You hear that? He's mine.

1188
01:36:54,407 --> 01:36:58,026
Where are them cops of yours, stoolie?
You're going to need them.

1189
01:37:03,709 --> 01:37:06,034
You're still short in the hatch, Mac.

1190
01:37:07,838 --> 01:37:10,543
Spec. Bring me the first man you see.

1191
01:37:12,302 --> 01:37:13,333
You.

1192
01:37:17,682 --> 01:37:19,841
Here's your man.

1193
01:37:22,729 --> 01:37:25,434
You want more of the same?
Come back tomorrow.

1194
01:37:28,944 --> 01:37:30,403
All right, that's it.

1195
01:37:52,845 --> 01:37:57,258
I hope that bum comes down here.
I'd love if he comes down here.

1196
01:37:58,101 --> 01:38:00,177
Did you ever hear of the Sullivan Law?

1197
01:38:00,270 --> 01:38:03,639
They'll be down on us for
the slightest infraction now, anything.

1198
01:38:03,732 --> 01:38:05,641
I'm going to be indicted any minute!

1199
01:38:05,734 --> 01:38:07,941
Come on, gimme.

1200
01:38:09,989 --> 01:38:12,065
Will you get it through your heads...

1201
01:38:12,158 --> 01:38:14,779
they're dusting off the hot seat for me!

1202
01:38:17,455 --> 01:38:19,578
We're a law-abiding union.

1203
01:38:20,041 --> 01:38:21,204
Understand?

1204
01:38:58,165 --> 01:38:59,660
Friendly!

1205
01:39:01,002 --> 01:39:03,160
John Friendly, come out of there!

1206
01:39:09,886 --> 01:39:11,963
You want to know the trouble with you?

1207
01:39:12,055 --> 01:39:15,341
You think it makes you a big man
if you give the answers.

1208
01:39:15,434 --> 01:39:18,388
At the right time I'll catch up with you.
Think about that.

1209
01:39:18,479 --> 01:39:21,599
- Now, go on, beat it. Don't push your luck.
- Wait a minute.

1210
01:39:21,691 --> 01:39:25,356
You take them heaters away from you
and you're nothing, you know that?

1211
01:39:25,445 --> 01:39:27,354
You'll talk yourself in the river!

1212
01:39:27,447 --> 01:39:30,282
You take the good goods away
and the kickbacks...

1213
01:39:30,367 --> 01:39:33,736
and shakedown cabbage
and the pistoleros and you're nothing!

1214
01:39:33,829 --> 01:39:37,032
Your guts is all in your wallet
and your trigger finger!

1215
01:39:37,249 --> 01:39:38,957
You ratted on us, Terry!

1216
01:39:39,168 --> 01:39:42,418
From where you stand, maybe.
But I'm standing over here now!

1217
01:39:42,505 --> 01:39:46,040
I was ratting on myself all them years,
I didn't even know it.

1218
01:39:46,217 --> 01:39:48,506
You gave it to Joey, you
gave it to Dugan...

1219
01:39:48,595 --> 01:39:51,382
and you gave it to Charley
who was one of your own.

1220
01:39:51,473 --> 01:39:54,474
You think you're God Almighty,
but you know what you are?

1221
01:39:54,559 --> 01:39:55,935
You're a cheap...

1222
01:39:56,019 --> 01:39:58,641
lousy, dirty, stinking mug...

1223
01:39:59,023 --> 01:40:01,229
and I'm glad what I done to you!

1224
01:40:01,525 --> 01:40:02,770
You hear that?

1225
01:40:02,860 --> 01:40:04,651
I'm glad what I done!

1226
01:40:05,530 --> 01:40:08,103
And I'm going to keep on
doing it till I get...

1227
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:09,900
Come on, come on.

1228
01:40:39,024 --> 01:40:41,100
That boy fights like he used to.

1229
01:40:52,747 --> 01:40:54,953
- They'll kill him.
- It's a massacre.

1230
01:40:55,041 --> 01:40:56,950
He's one of theirs anyway.

1231
01:41:00,964 --> 01:41:03,171
- What are we waiting for?
- Let's go!

1232
01:41:05,219 --> 01:41:06,464
That's enough.

1233
01:41:07,471 --> 01:41:09,179
Just let him lay there.

1234
01:41:32,540 --> 01:41:33,785
What happened?

1235
01:41:37,378 --> 01:41:38,956
Jimmy, what happened?

1236
01:41:46,763 --> 01:41:48,306
Where are you going?

1237
01:41:48,557 --> 01:41:49,672
Let me by.

1238
01:42:05,158 --> 01:42:06,356
You want him?

1239
01:42:09,162 --> 01:42:10,573
You can have him!

1240
01:42:16,587 --> 01:42:18,379
The little rat's yours.

1241
01:42:30,435 --> 01:42:32,724
Get some fresh water!

1242
01:42:36,150 --> 01:42:37,313
Terry.

1243
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:40,899
Who's in charge here?

1244
01:42:40,988 --> 01:42:43,277
Yours truly is in charge here.

1245
01:42:43,366 --> 01:42:46,367
We got to get this ship out of here.
It's costing us money.

1246
01:42:46,453 --> 01:42:47,698
Blow your whistle.

1247
01:42:47,787 --> 01:42:49,864
All right you guys, get to work!

1248
01:42:50,832 --> 01:42:51,864
Come on!

1249
01:42:52,501 --> 01:42:55,502
- What goes?
- I'll have them working in two minutes.

1250
01:42:55,921 --> 01:42:58,412
He better get these men to work.

1251
01:43:00,801 --> 01:43:03,375
Come on, you guys, on the double!
Get to work!

1252
01:43:03,471 --> 01:43:06,507
Come on. Get in there. Get in there.

1253
01:43:07,517 --> 01:43:10,518
- How about Terry?
- If he don't work, we don't work.

1254
01:43:10,687 --> 01:43:12,810
Work! He can't even walk!

1255
01:43:13,357 --> 01:43:16,477
You want to know who works?
The ones I pick to work.

1256
01:43:16,568 --> 01:43:19,273
Now get going.
Come on all of you, get in there.

1257
01:43:21,407 --> 01:43:23,150
Come on, get out here.

1258
01:43:23,284 --> 01:43:25,573
Come on, Pop, on the double,
you work today.

1259
01:43:25,661 --> 01:43:28,153
All my life you pushed me around.

1260
01:43:28,331 --> 01:43:29,825
Come on.

1261
01:43:42,972 --> 01:43:44,881
Come on, you walk in with them.

1262
01:43:53,274 --> 01:43:57,486
If Terry walks in, we walk in with him.
They're waiting for him to walk in.

1263
01:44:07,873 --> 01:44:09,617
Did you hear that, Terry?

1264
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:13,498
Terry, did you hear that?

1265
01:44:13,588 --> 01:44:14,619
Yeah.

1266
01:44:15,465 --> 01:44:19,629
You lost the battle,
but you have a chance to win the war.

1267
01:44:21,430 --> 01:44:23,339
- What do I have to do?
- Walk.

1268
01:44:23,849 --> 01:44:25,094
Can you walk?

1269
01:44:26,268 --> 01:44:27,763
- Walk.
- Yes, walk.

1270
01:44:29,814 --> 01:44:31,605
To the pier, I mean.

1271
01:44:31,691 --> 01:44:34,360
- We'll walk in with you.
- So the shippers can see...

1272
01:44:34,444 --> 01:44:37,017
we'll take no more orders
from Johnny Friendly.

1273
01:44:37,113 --> 01:44:41,028
Then it'll give us back our union,
so we can run it on the up and up.

1274
01:44:41,576 --> 01:44:44,613
Johnny Friendly's laying odds
that you won't get up.

1275
01:44:48,083 --> 01:44:51,120
What are you standing around for?
Come on, help me!

1276
01:44:52,255 --> 01:44:53,665
Come on, you guys.

1277
01:44:55,425 --> 01:44:58,841
Put me on my feet. Come on.

1278
01:45:10,357 --> 01:45:11,602
How you doing?

1279
01:45:14,028 --> 01:45:15,688
Am I on my feet?

1280
01:45:17,115 --> 01:45:18,657
You're on your feet.

1281
01:45:21,244 --> 01:45:23,735
- I don't think I'm gonna make it.
- Terry!

1282
01:45:24,831 --> 01:45:25,863
You can.

1283
01:45:29,670 --> 01:45:32,920
Just finish what you started. You can.

1284
01:45:40,848 --> 01:45:42,224
Give me my hook.

1285
01:45:42,559 --> 01:45:44,931
Look, for God's sake,
what're you trying to do?

1286
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:47,392
Take your hands off him. Keep going.

1287
01:45:52,528 --> 01:45:53,903
Leave him alone!

1288
01:46:56,805 --> 01:46:59,047
All right, let's go to work!

1289
01:47:12,072 --> 01:47:14,527
Where you guys going? Wait a minute.

1290
01:47:15,117 --> 01:47:18,700
I'll remember this.
I'll remember every one of you!

1291
01:47:20,205 --> 01:47:22,531
I'll be back! Don't you forget that!

1292
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,542
I'll be back!
