00:00:03,172 --> 00:00:34,984
Thank you "hadilan"

2
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:16,400
Nick, this was a tragedy,
but it's not why we're here.

3
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,735
What, are we fighting the weather now?

4
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,572
Locals say the cyclone had a face.

5
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:24,328
People see things
when they're under stress.

6
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:28,879
That does not mean that this is the start
to some other big world-ending...

7
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,344
Who are you?

8
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,433
You don't want any part of this.

25
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,805
Thanks to Kenneth Lim
and Vihaan Ramamurthy

26
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,928
for their help
with that touching video tribute.

27
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:09,604
- This year has been nothing short of...
- **** is crazy. It's insane.

28
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,690
- Jason.
- What?

29
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:11,977
No swearing.

30
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,808
It's the last day of school. We're good.

31
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:15,986
Historic.

32
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,522
Over five years ago,
half of all life in the universe,

33
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:23,826
<i>including our own Midtown High,
was wiped from existence.</i>

34
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,529
Then eight months ago,
a band of brave heroes

35
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,623
<i>brought us back.</i>

36
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,580
They called it "the Blip."

37
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,253
<i>Those of us who Blipped away
came back the same age...</i>

38
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:38,925
<i>But our classmates that didn't Blip
had grown five years older.</i>

39
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:43,004
- My little brother is now older than me.
- Yeah, it's math.

40
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:46,136
Even though we had Blipped away
halfway through the school year

41
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,434
and had already taken midterms,

42
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,183
the school made us start the whole year
over from the beginning.

43
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:52,935
It's totally unfair.

44
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,140
It's not right.

45
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:59,150
Tigers, it's been a long, dramatic,
somewhat confusing road.

46
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,690
<i>As we draw this year to a close,</i>

47
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,991
<i>it's time to move on...</i>

48
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,162
<i>- to a new phase of our lives.
- Pray nothing crazy happens again</i>

49
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,331
<i>because are The Avengers even
a thing anymore?</i>

50
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,330
<i>- Does anyone even have a plan?</i>
- I have a plan.

51
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,753
Okay, first, I'm gonna sit
next to MJ on the flight.

52
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,421
- Mm-hm.
- Second, I'm gonna buy

53
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:20,250
a dual-headphone adapter and watch
movies with her the whole time.

54
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,460
- Okay.
- Three, when we go to Venice...

55
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,490
Venice is famous for making stuff
out of glass, right?

56
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,800
- True.
- So I'm gonna buy her

57
00:04:25,891 --> 00:04:28,975
a black dahlia necklace because
her favorite flower is the black dahlia

58
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,471
- because of, well...
- The murder.

59
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:32,428
The murder. Four, when we go to Paris,

60
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,809
I'm gonna take her to the top
of the Eiffel Tower,

61
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,482
- give her the necklace.
- Oh.

62
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,434
Then, five, I'm gonna tell her how I feel.

63
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:42,905
Then, six, hopefully she tells me
she feels the same way.

64
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,323
Oh, don't forget step seven.

65
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,401
- Step seven?
- Don't do any of that.

66
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:50,701
- Why?
- We're gonna be bachelors in Europe.

67
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,702
- Ned.
- Look,

68
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,159
I may not know much, but I do know this:

69
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,619
Europeans love Americans.

70
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,504
- Really?
- More than half of them are women.

71
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,173
Okay. Sure.

72
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,172
But I really like MJ, man, okay?

73
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,005
She's awesome, she's super funny
in a kind of dark way.

74
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,761
Sometimes I catch her looking at me,
I feel like I've stood up...

75
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,913
- She's coming. Don't say anything.
- What up, dorks?

76
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:15,772
- Excited about the science trip?
- Hey, we're talking about the trip.

77
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,315
- Yeah, and Peter's plan.
- You have a plan?

78
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,315
I don't... I don't have a plan.

79
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:26,031
No, he's just gonna collect tiny spoons
when we're traveling to other countries.

80
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,608
Like a grandmother?

81
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,033
I'm not collecting tiny spoons.
He's collecting tiny spoons.

82
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,658
Oh, okay, well...

83
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,413
that was a real roller coaster.

84
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:37,539
By the way, travel tip:

85
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,712
You should download a VPN
on your phone,

86
00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:42,131
so the government can't track you
while we're abroad.

87
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:44,709
Smart. Will do.

88
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,263
Ugh.

89
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,888
Dude, I think that went really great.

90
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,524
So what are you going to do
on your last day in New York?

91
00:06:02,275 --> 00:06:04,068
Ooh, I have some errands to run.

92
00:06:04,152 --> 00:06:07,238
I have to get a mini toothpaste,
pick up my passport,

93
00:06:07,322 --> 00:06:09,407
and then take down
the Manfredi crime family.

94
00:06:09,491 --> 00:06:10,492
Oh.

95
00:06:12,911 --> 00:06:14,454
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

96
00:06:14,537 --> 00:06:16,857
- You need some guy-in-the-chair help or...
- No, I'm okay.

97
00:06:31,095 --> 00:06:33,348
- Are you planning a trip?
- Uh, Europe, yeah.

98
00:06:33,431 --> 00:06:35,266
- Oh, can I come?
- It's a science trip.

99
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,144
The history of science.
Tesla, Da Vinci and all that.

100
00:06:38,603 --> 00:06:39,896
I'm good.

101
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:40,980
Anything else?

102
00:06:41,064 --> 00:06:43,983
Uh, uh...

103
00:06:46,778 --> 00:06:48,988
The dual headphone adaptor.

104
00:06:51,991 --> 00:06:54,702
That is literally exactly what I said.
Maybe word for word.

105
00:06:54,786 --> 00:06:55,828
Here.

106
00:07:00,792 --> 00:07:01,918
You sure about this?

107
00:07:02,502 --> 00:07:04,837
Yeah. I wanna buy a girl I like
something really nice.

108
00:07:05,588 --> 00:07:06,589
Hm.

109
00:07:06,923 --> 00:07:08,550
Well, hope she's worth it.

110
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:10,510
Actually, can I keep the Lobot?

111
00:07:11,553 --> 00:07:12,971
Thanks. Yeah, I'll keep that one.

112
00:07:49,924 --> 00:07:52,343
Hey. Peter Parker here
to pick up a passport, please.

113
00:07:59,225 --> 00:08:01,436
Let's keep it moving, guys.
I got a lot to do today.

114
00:08:09,777 --> 00:08:12,113
Aah!

115
00:08:14,157 --> 00:08:15,658
Just kidding. It's bulletproof.

116
00:08:27,045 --> 00:08:28,254
Fresh-ground pepper, anyone?

117
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:44,187
Yeah, so he's the first-in-command,
he's pretty much just a runner,

118
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,832
and then that's the buyer,
that's the seller, and that's the snitch.

119
00:08:46,856 --> 00:08:48,524
- Hey!
- I'm sorry, he's not...

120
00:08:48,608 --> 00:08:50,169
You should
probably put him in his own cell.

121
00:08:50,193 --> 00:08:52,153
- Yeah.
- 80, keeping the fancy suit?

122
00:08:52,236 --> 00:08:54,113
- Uh...
- You gonna be the next Iron Man now?

123
00:08:54,197 --> 00:08:56,383
Well, no, I don't have time.
I'm too busy doing your job.

124
00:08:56,407 --> 00:08:58,409
- Ohh!
- I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Look.

125
00:08:58,493 --> 00:09:00,429
You're gonna have to do your jobs
for a couple of weeks, okay,

126
00:09:00,453 --> 00:09:02,997
because I am going on vacation.

127
00:09:03,414 --> 00:09:06,094
- Yeah, but could I still get that selfie?
- Next time.

128
00:09:07,043 --> 00:09:10,421
- What? It's for my nephew.
- Sure.

129
00:09:11,746 --> 00:09:13,863
When I Blipped back to my apartment,

130
00:09:13,957 --> 00:09:16,916
the family that was living there
was very confused.

131
00:09:17,002 --> 00:09:19,665
The wife thought that I was a mistress.

132
00:09:19,754 --> 00:09:23,873
The grandma thought that I was a ghost.
It was... It was really a mess.

133
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,549
Thank you for coming out

134
00:09:25,635 --> 00:09:28,127
to support those who have been
displaced by the Blip.

135
00:09:28,221 --> 00:09:32,010
And, of course,
thanks to our very own Spider-Man!

136
00:09:42,736 --> 00:09:45,854
Thank you, Miss Parker, for having me.

137
00:09:45,947 --> 00:09:48,405
And thank you, you guys, for having me.

138
00:09:50,869 --> 00:09:52,235
And thank you, Spider-Man.

139
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:56,323
He'll be right back out
to take photos and videos. Thank you!

140
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,122
- That was amazing.
- That was great.

141
00:10:04,216 --> 00:10:07,675
- That was so cool. I was so nervous.
- I was a little stiff. I wasn't in the pocket.

142
00:10:07,761 --> 00:10:10,720
- I thought you did great.
- You were a little stiff.

143
00:10:11,556 --> 00:10:13,343
Yeah, I felt that too. I felt that too.

144
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:14,799
- It's fine, it's fine.
- Okay.

145
00:10:14,893 --> 00:10:16,304
- Did you get your passport?
- Yeah.

146
00:10:16,394 --> 00:10:17,674
- Mini toothpaste?
- Yeah, I did.

147
00:10:19,523 --> 00:10:20,730
Hey, sorry I'm late.

148
00:10:21,483 --> 00:10:24,146
- Happy. Hey.
- Oh, you look lovely.

149
00:10:24,236 --> 00:10:26,193
- Thanks. You too.
- Thank you.

150
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,316
- New dress?
- Yeah, yes, it is.

151
00:10:29,491 --> 00:10:31,699
- It's a new beard.
- It's my... My Blip beard.

152
00:10:31,785 --> 00:10:33,447
I grew it in the Blip.

153
00:10:33,995 --> 00:10:35,236
It's a Blip beard.

154
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,537
I see. Yeah.

155
00:10:36,623 --> 00:10:39,957
The reason I'm late is
because this was misplaced at the office.

156
00:10:40,043 --> 00:10:43,127
Can you believe it? Because
it's enormous. Not the amount, the size.

157
00:10:43,213 --> 00:10:45,705
- The amount's nice too. They're generous.
- Oh, ha-ha.

158
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:48,257
- Pepper said, sorry she couldn't be here.
- Yeah. Thank you.

159
00:10:48,802 --> 00:10:52,842
I think I'm gonna go change
the Sterno under the vegan lasagna.

160
00:10:53,723 --> 00:10:55,806
Spider-Man, go shake hands.

161
00:10:56,184 --> 00:10:57,550
Will do.

162
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,306
What just happened?

163
00:11:04,025 --> 00:11:06,392
Heads up, Nick Fury's calling you.

164
00:11:06,486 --> 00:11:08,478
- Fury's gonna call me? Why?
- Yeah.

165
00:11:08,572 --> 00:11:11,360
Why? He probably has hero stuff
for you to do.

166
00:11:11,449 --> 00:11:13,532
You're a superhero.
He calls superheroes.

167
00:11:13,618 --> 00:11:16,952
If it was that important,
he'd probably call someone else, not me.

168
00:11:18,123 --> 00:11:19,159
Apparently not.

169
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:26,128
- No caller ID. That's him.
- I don't wanna talk to Fury.

170
00:11:26,214 --> 00:11:27,214
- Answer the phone.
- Why?

171
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:29,586
If you don't talk to him, I have to,
and I don't want to.

172
00:11:29,676 --> 00:11:31,884
- Why not?
- Because I'm scared. Answer the phone.

173
00:11:33,346 --> 00:11:35,258
- You sent Nick Fury to voicemail?
- Yeah.

174
00:11:35,348 --> 00:11:38,091
- You don't send Fury to voicemail.
- Hear that? They're calling me.

175
00:11:38,184 --> 00:11:39,846
- I gotta go.
- You gotta talk to him.

176
00:11:39,936 --> 00:11:42,519
I'm gonna call him.
I promise you, I'm gonna call him. I will.

177
00:11:42,606 --> 00:11:44,472
You do not ghost Nick Fury.

178
00:11:44,566 --> 00:11:46,353
I promise you, I'll call him.

179
00:11:47,944 --> 00:11:49,480
After my trip.

180
00:11:49,571 --> 00:11:50,402
Hey!

181
00:11:51,781 --> 00:11:54,865
Yeah, hi... No, no, he's not ghosting you.

182
00:11:57,412 --> 00:11:59,278
Okay, one question at a time.

183
00:11:59,372 --> 00:12:01,785
Are you the head Avenger?
Are you the head Avenger now?

184
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,241
Uh, no, I'm not.

185
00:12:03,335 --> 00:12:05,497
If the aliens come back,
what are you gonna do?

186
00:12:05,587 --> 00:12:07,267
If the aliens come back, what will you do?

187
00:12:07,714 --> 00:12:09,580
Does anyone have
any neighborhood questions?

188
00:12:10,675 --> 00:12:12,007
Sean Winford, <i>Queens Tribune.</i>

189
00:12:12,093 --> 00:12:13,925
What is it like to take over
from Tony Stark?

190
00:12:14,012 --> 00:12:15,469
Those are some big shoes to fill.

191
00:12:19,267 --> 00:12:22,886
I'm, uh... I'm gonna go.
Thanks so much, everyone, for coming.

192
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:04,770
Okay.

193
00:13:10,777 --> 00:13:11,777
Hungry?

194
00:13:12,904 --> 00:13:15,521
Oh... So sorry. Ha-ha.

195
00:13:15,615 --> 00:13:18,983
I thought you could sense that
with your Peter-tingle.

196
00:13:19,077 --> 00:13:21,410
Please do not start calling it
my Peter-tingle.

197
00:13:21,496 --> 00:13:24,534
What's up? You can dodge bullets
but not bananas?

198
00:13:24,624 --> 00:13:28,334
No, I just really need this vacation.
I need a break.

199
00:13:29,254 --> 00:13:30,290
You deserve it.

200
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,799
Yeah.

201
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:35,509
You know what?

202
00:13:36,553 --> 00:13:39,591
You should pack your suit, just in case.
I have a tingle about it.

203
00:13:40,682 --> 00:13:43,015
Please stop saying "tingle," May.

204
00:13:45,562 --> 00:13:46,643
No.

205
00:13:52,861 --> 00:13:54,693
No. No, I'm not.

206
00:13:59,492 --> 00:14:02,985
- Yeah!
- Can you help me get my stuff up?

207
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:05,241
- Oh, sorry, that's mine.
- No worries.

208
00:14:05,331 --> 00:14:08,790
- Middle seat gets both armrests.
- Give me a tablet.

209
00:14:08,877 --> 00:14:11,540
Do you want the first shift
or the second? I could take either.

210
00:14:11,629 --> 00:14:13,666
Give me the third shift. I took an Ambien.

211
00:14:13,757 --> 00:14:16,591
- I can't chaperone these kids alone.
- Yo, Parker.

212
00:14:16,676 --> 00:14:19,635
This is called an airplane.
It's like the buses you're used to,

213
00:14:19,721 --> 00:14:23,135
except it flies over the poor neighborhoods
instead of driving through them.

214
00:14:23,224 --> 00:14:24,760
- Ma'am?
- Mm-hm?

215
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:28,561
He Blipped, so technically,
he's 16, not 21.

216
00:14:28,646 --> 00:14:29,807
I'll take that.

217
00:14:29,898 --> 00:14:32,356
She's lying. I don't even know this girl.

218
00:14:34,903 --> 00:14:36,394
Classic MJ, right?

219
00:14:38,656 --> 00:14:40,773
Did you know Brad was coming?

220
00:14:40,867 --> 00:14:42,779
It... It's so weird.

221
00:14:42,869 --> 00:14:45,782
One day, he's that kid who cried
and got nosebleeds all the time,

222
00:14:45,872 --> 00:14:47,864
and suddenly, we Blip back,

223
00:14:47,957 --> 00:14:51,576
and he's totally ripped and super nice
and all these girls are after him.

224
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:55,003
- Not all the girls are after him.
- No, man, they're all after him.

225
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:56,375
Yeah. Here.

226
00:14:56,466 --> 00:14:59,129
Anyway, on to more important things.

227
00:14:59,219 --> 00:15:02,678
It's a nine-hour flight. We can play
<i>Beast Slayers</i> the whole time.

228
00:15:02,764 --> 00:15:04,050
Are you excited?

229
00:15:05,183 --> 00:15:06,765
I need your help to sit next to MJ.

230
00:15:08,561 --> 00:15:10,473
- Seriously?
- Yes, seriously.

231
00:15:10,563 --> 00:15:13,522
What about our plan?
American bachelors in Europe.

232
00:15:13,608 --> 00:15:16,396
That's your plan. That's a solo plan.
Come on, this is my plan.

233
00:15:19,614 --> 00:15:20,855
Please.

234
00:15:24,828 --> 00:15:26,660
Hey, guys.

235
00:15:26,746 --> 00:15:30,831
There's an old lady in front of us
wearing a crazy amount of perfume,

236
00:15:30,917 --> 00:15:34,035
and it's kind of setting off
Peter's allergies.

237
00:15:34,754 --> 00:15:38,293
Uh, Betty, if you could switch seats
with him, that would be...

238
00:15:38,383 --> 00:15:39,544
He's allergic to perfume?

239
00:15:40,844 --> 00:15:42,631
Yeah, yeah, because it...

240
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,336
It makes his eyes water,

241
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,717
- and he can't really...
- Peter has a perfume allergy?

242
00:15:46,808 --> 00:15:47,889
Oh, uh...

243
00:15:47,976 --> 00:15:50,184
From experience,
perfume allergies are no joke.

244
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:53,559
I can feel hives breaking out already.
MJ, stand up.

245
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:57,437
Ned, take MJ's spot.
MJ, you take my spot.

246
00:15:57,527 --> 00:15:58,984
Peter, let's get you out of there.

247
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,902
- Sorry.
- Zach and Sebastian,

248
00:16:00,989 --> 00:16:03,322
- you take Ned and Peter's seats.
- That's all right.

249
00:16:03,408 --> 00:16:05,821
Ned, thanks for bringing this
to my attention.

250
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,323
Your safety is my responsibility.
And Mr. Dell's, but he's...

251
00:16:10,081 --> 00:16:12,164
I got it for now. Let's go, Peter!

252
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,750
Let's go!

253
00:16:20,383 --> 00:16:24,002
Yeah, I have a small bladder,
so I took the aisle.

254
00:16:26,764 --> 00:16:29,472
So did you want to play <i>Beast Slayer?</i>

255
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:30,559
Nope.

256
00:16:31,728 --> 00:16:33,936
Have you ever played
any kind of PC game or...?

257
00:16:34,022 --> 00:16:36,514
- No.
- Got it. Ahem.

258
00:16:36,608 --> 00:16:39,021
Did I tell you
how my wife pretended to Blip out?

259
00:16:40,528 --> 00:16:43,236
Turns out, she ran off
with a guy in her hiking group.

260
00:16:43,323 --> 00:16:44,780
We had a fake funeral for her.

261
00:16:44,866 --> 00:16:47,950
Well, the funeral was real
because I thought she was really dead.

262
00:16:48,036 --> 00:16:49,072
Wanna see the video?

263
00:16:49,162 --> 00:16:52,075
Oh, I got a dual-headphone adapter
if you want to watch a movie.

264
00:16:52,165 --> 00:16:54,657
Only if it's depressing. Or hilarious.

265
00:16:54,751 --> 00:16:57,710
Oh, you have a dual-headphone adapter.
We can watch together.

266
00:16:58,212 --> 00:17:01,376
<i>Good afternoon,
this is your captain speaking.</i>

267
00:17:01,466 --> 00:17:05,210
<i>Our flight time will be eight hours,
49 minutes to Venice, Italy.</i>

268
00:17:16,981 --> 00:17:18,472
Oh.

269
00:17:18,691 --> 00:17:19,691
Oh!

270
00:18:10,827 --> 00:18:12,034
Nice picture.

271
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,533
Hey, did you see Brad and MJ
on the plane?

272
00:18:14,622 --> 00:18:16,909
They were watching movies
and laughing the entire time.

273
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,582
Dude, don't worry, okay?

274
00:18:18,668 --> 00:18:20,785
- I'm sure that's nothing.
- Hey, babe.

275
00:18:20,878 --> 00:18:22,119
- Huh?
- Can you hold this?

276
00:18:22,213 --> 00:18:23,920
- Yeah, of course.
- Thanks.

277
00:18:32,765 --> 00:18:33,765
What was that?

278
00:18:34,642 --> 00:18:38,181
Uh, well, we got to talking on the plane,
and it turns out,

279
00:18:38,271 --> 00:18:39,762
we have a lot in common.

280
00:18:39,856 --> 00:18:42,394
So we're boyfriend and girlfriend now.

281
00:18:42,483 --> 00:18:45,226
Whatever happened to being
an American bachelor in Europe?

282
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:48,027
Peter, those were the words of a boy.

283
00:18:48,114 --> 00:18:50,572
And that boy met a woman.

284
00:18:50,658 --> 00:18:53,401
A very strong and powerful woman.

285
00:18:53,494 --> 00:18:56,328
And now that boy's a man.

286
00:18:56,414 --> 00:18:58,030
- Babe?
- Coming, babe.

287
00:19:03,504 --> 00:19:05,712
There's nothing in there. I swear.

288
00:19:22,106 --> 00:19:23,222
These, no.

289
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,111
Sorry. Sorry.

290
00:19:35,078 --> 00:19:37,264
- I'm here. Mr. Harrington.
- Wait, wait, wait.

291
00:19:37,288 --> 00:19:39,308
- I'm here, I'm here.
- Oh, thank goodness.

292
00:20:13,199 --> 00:20:16,818
Looks like we're here.
They're doing renovations to the place.

293
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:19,449
- Getting some upgrades.
- Oh, this is trash.

294
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:20,996
- That must be the concierge.
- Okay.

295
00:20:21,082 --> 00:20:22,198
Come on, man.

296
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:26,960
- Everyone, here we are.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

297
00:20:27,088 --> 00:20:29,045
- Tell me we're not staying here.
- Come on in.

298
00:20:29,132 --> 00:20:30,668
This place is sinking.

299
00:20:30,758 --> 00:20:32,875
- You mean, "charming."
- It stinks.

300
00:20:32,969 --> 00:20:35,336
Okay, everybody, drop your bags off.

301
00:20:35,429 --> 00:20:38,217
We're gonna meet
at the da Vinci Museum at 3. Let's go!

302
00:20:38,307 --> 00:20:40,390
<i>- ¡Vamonos!</i>
- It's <i>"andiamo."</i>

303
00:20:40,476 --> 00:20:41,683
<i>- Andiamo!</i>
- There you go.

304
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:43,351
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

305
00:20:43,437 --> 00:20:45,394
When you're in Venice,
your socks get wet.

306
00:20:50,987 --> 00:20:53,400
What's up, Flash Mob?
How you guys doing?

307
00:20:53,489 --> 00:20:55,902
I'm here in St. Marco Polo's... Oh!

308
00:20:57,034 --> 00:20:58,991
- This is so much fun.
- Yeah?

309
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,300
Oh!

310
00:21:22,268 --> 00:21:24,510
- Three, two, one.
- Say "pizza."

311
00:21:24,604 --> 00:21:26,846
- Pizza!
- Pizza time!

312
00:21:48,127 --> 00:21:49,538
Hi.

313
00:21:49,629 --> 00:21:51,120
I'm looking for a, uh...

314
00:22:02,433 --> 00:22:03,674
It's perfect.

315
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,566
<i>Boh.</i>

316
00:22:13,486 --> 00:22:14,351
What?

317
00:22:14,445 --> 00:22:15,481
<i>Boh.</i>

318
00:22:15,613 --> 00:22:18,447
The most perfect word.
Italians created it, I just discovered it.

319
00:22:18,532 --> 00:22:20,615
- What does it mean?
- It can mean a million things.

320
00:22:20,701 --> 00:22:22,408
"I don't know." "Get out of my face."

321
00:22:22,495 --> 00:22:24,407
"I don't know" and "Get out of my face."

322
00:22:24,497 --> 00:22:27,205
It's the best thing Italy created,
except for, maybe, espresso.

323
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:29,954
- Oh, so you've been drinking espresso.
- Eh.

324
00:22:30,044 --> 00:22:32,957
Hey. German? American.

325
00:22:33,047 --> 00:22:34,504
- A rose for you.
<i>- Boh.</i>

326
00:22:36,092 --> 00:22:38,755
- Whoa.
<i>- "Boh"</i> is my new superpower.

327
00:22:38,844 --> 00:22:41,427
It's like the anti-"aloha."
I was born to say this word.

328
00:22:42,556 --> 00:22:44,013
So, what's in the bag?

329
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,967
Oh, uh... <i>Boh.</i>

330
00:22:47,937 --> 00:22:48,937
Nice.

331
00:22:56,821 --> 00:22:58,107
Whoa, cool.

332
00:23:14,964 --> 00:23:15,964
What was that?

333
00:23:39,155 --> 00:23:41,021
- Betty! You okay?
- Yeah.

334
00:23:42,033 --> 00:23:43,490
- Oh, my God!
- Come on.

335
00:23:43,576 --> 00:23:45,033
Guys, we gotta go!

336
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,247
- What is that?
- I don't know.

337
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,165
- What'll you do?
- Left my suit in the hotel.

338
00:23:52,251 --> 00:23:54,117
- Why?
- I'm on vacation, Ned!

339
00:23:54,211 --> 00:23:55,772
Everyone will see my face.
Get them out of here.

340
00:23:55,796 --> 00:23:56,796
- Go!
- Just go!

341
00:24:07,141 --> 00:24:08,348
Get out of here. Go!

342
00:24:11,103 --> 00:24:12,139
Oh, my God.

343
00:24:20,363 --> 00:24:21,363
Come on.

344
00:24:34,585 --> 00:24:35,951
Oh, no, you don't.

345
00:24:46,389 --> 00:24:48,631
You okay? Get out of here. Go!

346
00:25:39,817 --> 00:25:40,728
Excuse me, sir!

347
00:25:40,818 --> 00:25:42,525
I... I can help. Let me help.

348
00:25:42,611 --> 00:25:44,273
I'm really strong, and I'm sticky.

349
00:25:44,363 --> 00:25:46,571
I need to lead it away from the canals.

350
00:26:11,974 --> 00:26:15,388
The da Vinci Museum.
This is why we're here in Venice.

351
00:26:15,478 --> 00:26:17,094
Oh, this is it.

352
00:26:17,188 --> 00:26:18,349
It's closed.

353
00:26:18,439 --> 00:26:20,226
What do you mean? Till when?

354
00:26:20,316 --> 00:26:21,316
November.

355
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,188
- You didn't check the website?
- Oh, that's a good idea.

356
00:26:39,502 --> 00:26:40,583
Oh, come on.

357
00:26:44,673 --> 00:26:46,790
Stay low, kids. We'll be safe here.

358
00:27:45,568 --> 00:27:46,934
Who is that guy?

359
00:27:47,027 --> 00:27:49,064
I don't know,
but he's kicking that water's ass.

360
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:22,511
Yeah! Yeah!

361
00:28:38,454 --> 00:28:39,945
It's aliens. It has to be.

362
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:42,076
BuzzFeed says there's a sailor
named Morris Bench

363
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:44,499
who was exposed to an experimental
underwater generator

364
00:28:44,585 --> 00:28:45,826
and got hydro powers.

365
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,003
Yeah, you should definitely believe
everything you read on the Internet.

366
00:28:49,089 --> 00:28:51,502
- Spider-Man could take him.
- What do you think it is?

367
00:28:53,927 --> 00:28:55,714
Being a man of science...

368
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:58,171
witches.

369
00:28:58,265 --> 00:29:00,131
No, no, no. We wanna stay.

370
00:29:00,225 --> 00:29:01,887
Good thing I packed your suit.

371
00:29:01,977 --> 00:29:04,811
<i>- I can't believe you forgot it.</i>
- Yeah.

372
00:29:04,897 --> 00:29:07,640
So who was that guy that you were with?
Was that Mr. Strange?

373
00:29:07,733 --> 00:29:12,273
Doctor Strange, May. Doctor Strange.
And, no, I don't know who that was.

374
00:29:12,363 --> 00:29:13,524
<i>It was a new guy.</i>

375
00:29:13,614 --> 00:29:15,776
- I was trying to help him...
- Happy, that's my lunch.

376
00:29:15,866 --> 00:29:17,027
Don't eat that one.

377
00:29:17,117 --> 00:29:20,155
- Happy's there?
- Yeah, it's Happy.

378
00:29:20,245 --> 00:29:22,407
He's here. He came by to volunteer.

379
00:29:22,498 --> 00:29:24,660
<i>And he's hanging around the office.</i>

380
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,163
- And he wants to say hi.
- I don't want... Hi, Peter.

381
00:29:27,628 --> 00:29:28,709
Hey, Happy.

382
00:29:30,005 --> 00:29:33,624
Sorry, I'm working hard here.
I gotta do a... A leaflet drop.

383
00:29:34,426 --> 00:29:36,655
- What are you doing...?
<i>- Glad you're having a good time.</i>

384
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:38,716
Don't worry,
I'm really taking care of your aunt.

385
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,183
So how's the plan going?

386
00:29:46,313 --> 00:29:48,225
There's been setbacks, for sure.

387
00:29:48,315 --> 00:29:50,807
Don't overthink it.
Trust your instincts and you'll be fine.

388
00:29:50,901 --> 00:29:51,901
<i>I know. Love you.</i>

389
00:29:52,194 --> 00:29:53,194
Bye.

390
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,396
Who is that guy?

391
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:59,028
He's like Iron Man and Thor
rolled into one.

392
00:29:59,118 --> 00:30:01,235
He's all right. He's no Spider-Man.

393
00:30:01,328 --> 00:30:03,160
What is it with you and Spider-Man?

394
00:30:03,997 --> 00:30:06,239
What? He's just awesome, okay?

395
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:09,667
He protects the neighborhood
and he's inspiring.

396
00:30:09,753 --> 00:30:11,870
He inspires me to be a better man.

397
00:30:11,964 --> 00:30:14,297
What's up, dickwad?
Thought you drowned.

398
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,256
Sounds like his name's Mysterio.

399
00:30:19,638 --> 00:30:23,302
<i>"L'uomo del misterio"</i> is Italian
for "man of mystery."

400
00:30:23,392 --> 00:30:26,556
- They don't actually know who he is.
- Mysterio.

401
00:30:27,563 --> 00:30:28,895
- Cool name.
- Cool name.

402
00:30:30,357 --> 00:30:31,357
- Babe.
- Babe.

403
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,357
So how much of that did you see?

404
00:30:33,444 --> 00:30:35,401
Not much. I was running.

405
00:30:35,487 --> 00:30:38,321
Right. Me too. I was also running...

406
00:30:38,407 --> 00:30:39,523
away.

407
00:30:41,577 --> 00:30:42,943
So Paris tomorrow.

408
00:30:43,787 --> 00:30:46,746
Go to the Eiffel Tower. Should be great.

409
00:30:46,832 --> 00:30:49,370
Yeah, I read it was secretly built
as a mind-control antenna

410
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,076
to create an army of the insane.

411
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:52,501
Oh.

412
00:30:52,588 --> 00:30:55,422
Which is why it's my favorite destination
on the whole trip.

413
00:30:58,093 --> 00:31:00,050
What are you gonna do about
the water monster?

414
00:31:00,804 --> 00:31:01,635
Nothing.

415
00:31:01,722 --> 00:31:04,715
It's dead.
Besides, that Mysterio guy's all over it.

416
00:31:04,808 --> 00:31:06,640
I just wanna spend some time with MJ.

417
00:31:06,727 --> 00:31:09,891
We were talking about Paris,
and I think she really likes me.

418
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:10,980
That's nice.

419
00:31:11,023 --> 00:31:13,106
Reminds me
of when Betty and I first fell in love.

420
00:31:13,192 --> 00:31:15,354
I had just finished
my fruit cobbler, right, and...

421
00:31:19,573 --> 00:31:23,908
You're a very difficult person
to contact, Spider-Man.

422
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:28,575
You're Nick Fury.

423
00:31:29,458 --> 00:31:30,915
And you just shot Ned.

424
00:31:31,001 --> 00:31:33,288
It's a mild tranquilizer. He'll be all right.

425
00:31:33,712 --> 00:31:36,580
So good to finally meet you.

426
00:31:36,673 --> 00:31:38,380
I saw you at the funeral,

427
00:31:38,467 --> 00:31:41,005
but I didn't think that was a good time
to exchange numbers.

428
00:31:41,094 --> 00:31:43,051
That would've been inappropriate.

429
00:31:43,138 --> 00:31:45,175
- That's what I just said.
- Right.

430
00:31:45,265 --> 00:31:49,054
The important thing is, you're here.
I tried to bring you here.

431
00:31:49,144 --> 00:31:52,012
You avoided me, and now you're here.

432
00:31:52,105 --> 00:31:53,812
What a coincidence.

433
00:31:53,899 --> 00:31:56,061
Wait. Was this a coincidence?

434
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:59,444
I used to know everything.

435
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:03,194
Then I come back five years later,
and now I know nothing.

436
00:32:03,283 --> 00:32:05,991
No intel, no team.

437
00:32:06,078 --> 00:32:08,286
And a high school kid

438
00:32:08,372 --> 00:32:11,331
is dodging my calls.

439
00:32:11,416 --> 00:32:12,998
Here's what I do know:

440
00:32:15,504 --> 00:32:20,875
A week ago, a village in Mexico
was wiped out by a cyclone.

441
00:32:21,426 --> 00:32:24,385
Witnesses say that cyclone had a face.

442
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,724
Three days later,
a similar event in Morocco.

443
00:32:32,813 --> 00:32:33,929
A village was...

444
00:32:35,691 --> 00:32:36,807
Just making the rounds.

445
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:40,359
See if anyone needs any counseling
after today's traumatic events.

446
00:32:40,445 --> 00:32:42,983
No, we'll be okay. We're fine. Thank you.

447
00:32:43,073 --> 00:32:46,316
Great because I'm...
I'm not qualified to actually...

448
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:47,946
Oh, he's passed out.

449
00:32:48,036 --> 00:32:51,200
I'm not qualified to do it anyway,
so good night.

450
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:56,292
That was my teacher. Sorry about that.
You were saying?

451
00:32:56,378 --> 00:32:59,587
A village was destroyed by what
may well be another world-threatening...

452
00:32:59,673 --> 00:33:02,791
Babe, you still awake?
You're not answering any of my texts.

453
00:33:02,885 --> 00:33:04,592
Um... He's asleep, Betty.

454
00:33:04,678 --> 00:33:06,044
Oh, already?

455
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:07,886
Mm-hm. Yeah.
- Okay.

456
00:33:07,973 --> 00:33:09,760
That's why it's imperative...

457
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:14,311
Hey, boys. So that canal water
today was filled with dangerous bacteria...

458
00:33:14,396 --> 00:33:18,140
Another person touches that door,
we are going to attend another funeral.

459
00:33:18,233 --> 00:33:21,271
- Suit up.
- Let me know if you start vomiting.

460
00:33:24,948 --> 00:33:26,940
Stark left these for you.

461
00:33:27,451 --> 00:33:28,451
Really?

462
00:33:39,504 --> 00:33:43,043
"Uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown."

463
00:33:44,217 --> 00:33:48,131
Stark said you wouldn't get that
because it's not a <i>Star Wars</i> reference.

464
00:33:52,517 --> 00:33:55,305
You can lose the mask.
Everyone here has seen you without it.

465
00:33:55,395 --> 00:33:57,011
You'd be feigning anonymity

466
00:33:57,105 --> 00:33:59,518
and breathing through spandex
for no good reason.

467
00:34:04,905 --> 00:34:05,905
Come on.

468
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:07,990
Yeah.

469
00:34:11,286 --> 00:34:13,699
Over there, we have Maria Hill.

470
00:34:14,957 --> 00:34:17,415
That is Dimitri.

471
00:34:18,251 --> 00:34:21,744
And this is Mr. Beck.

472
00:34:24,091 --> 00:34:25,091
Mysterio?

473
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,550
What?

474
00:34:27,636 --> 00:34:30,470
Doesn't matter. It's just what
my friends have been calling you.

475
00:34:30,555 --> 00:34:33,093
Well, you can call me Quentin.

476
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,854
You handled yourself well out there today.
I saw what you did with the tower.

477
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,852
We could use someone like you
on my world.

478
00:34:41,942 --> 00:34:43,649
Thanks.

479
00:34:43,735 --> 00:34:45,146
I'm sorry. Your world?

480
00:34:45,237 --> 00:34:47,945
Mr. Beck is from Earth.

481
00:34:48,031 --> 00:34:49,567
Just not yours.

482
00:34:49,658 --> 00:34:51,365
There are multiple realities.

483
00:34:51,451 --> 00:34:54,569
This is Earth Dimension 616.
I'm from Earth 833.

484
00:34:55,288 --> 00:34:57,780
Sorry, you're saying there's a multiverse?

485
00:34:57,874 --> 00:34:59,740
I thought that was theoretical.

486
00:34:59,835 --> 00:35:02,122
That changes how we understand
the initial singularity.

487
00:35:02,212 --> 00:35:04,374
We're talking about
an eternal inflation system.

488
00:35:04,464 --> 00:35:06,456
How does that even work
with all the quantum...?

489
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,550
It's insane.

490
00:35:08,969 --> 00:35:11,928
Sorry. It's really cool.

491
00:35:13,056 --> 00:35:15,416
Don't ever apologize for being
the smartest one in the room.

492
00:35:17,769 --> 00:35:18,769
Anyway...

493
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,399
They were born in stable orbits
within black holes.

494
00:35:24,484 --> 00:35:26,646
Creatures formed
from the primary elements:

495
00:35:26,737 --> 00:35:29,275
Air, water, fire, earth.

496
00:35:29,364 --> 00:35:31,902
The Science Division had
a technical name.

497
00:35:31,992 --> 00:35:34,075
We just called them Elementals.

498
00:35:34,161 --> 00:35:36,574
Versions of them exist
across our mythologies.

499
00:35:36,663 --> 00:35:38,450
Turns out, the myths are real.

500
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,327
Like Thor.

501
00:35:40,417 --> 00:35:43,501
Thor was a myth,
now I study him in my physics class.

502
00:35:43,587 --> 00:35:46,000
These myths are threats.

503
00:35:46,506 --> 00:35:48,748
They first materialized
on my Earth many years ago.

504
00:35:48,842 --> 00:35:50,083
We mobilized and fought them,

505
00:35:50,177 --> 00:35:52,840
but with each battle,
they grew, got stronger.

506
00:35:52,929 --> 00:35:55,888
I was part of the last battalion left
trying to stop them.

507
00:35:56,349 --> 00:35:58,181
All we did was delay the inevitable.

508
00:35:58,268 --> 00:36:01,557
The Elementals are here now,
attacking the same coordinates.

509
00:36:01,646 --> 00:36:02,807
Our satellites confirm it.

510
00:36:02,898 --> 00:36:05,606
Thank Mr. Beck for destroying
the other three.

511
00:36:05,692 --> 00:36:07,433
There's only one left: fire.

512
00:36:07,986 --> 00:36:11,445
The strongest of them all.
The one that destroyed my Earth.

513
00:36:13,575 --> 00:36:15,362
It's the one that took my family.

514
00:36:18,914 --> 00:36:20,280
I'm sorry.

515
00:36:20,373 --> 00:36:22,831
And it will be in Prague
in approximately 48 hours.

516
00:36:22,918 --> 00:36:27,083
We have one mission: kill it.
And you're coming with us.

517
00:36:28,924 --> 00:36:30,961
I'm sorry, did you say Prague? Heh.

518
00:36:31,802 --> 00:36:36,547
Mr. Fury, this all seems like bigtime,
you know, huge superhero kind of stuff.

519
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,133
And I'm just a friendly
neighborhood Spider-Man, sir.

520
00:36:40,227 --> 00:36:42,014
Bitch, please. You've been to space.

521
00:36:42,104 --> 00:36:43,766
I know, but that was an accident.

522
00:36:43,855 --> 00:36:45,767
There's gotta be someone else
you can use.

523
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,732
- What about Thor?
- Off-world.

524
00:36:48,819 --> 00:36:50,526
Okay, um, Doctor Strange.

525
00:36:50,612 --> 00:36:52,148
- Unavailable.
- Captain Marvel.

526
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:53,650
Don't invoke her name.

527
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,697
Sir, look, I wanna help. I do.

528
00:36:55,784 --> 00:36:58,367
But if my aunt finds out I left
my class trip, she'll kill me.

529
00:36:58,453 --> 00:37:00,820
And if I'm seen in Europe
after the Washington Monument,

530
00:37:00,914 --> 00:37:03,452
my class will figure out who I am, then...

531
00:37:03,542 --> 00:37:06,102
Then the whole world will figure out
who I am, and then I'm done.

532
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,661
Okay.

533
00:37:08,755 --> 00:37:10,166
I understand.

534
00:37:11,633 --> 00:37:12,633
I'm sorry, what?

535
00:37:12,717 --> 00:37:15,425
Why don't you get back
before your teachers miss you

536
00:37:15,512 --> 00:37:17,219
and become suspicious.

537
00:37:18,056 --> 00:37:19,467
Dimitri.

538
00:37:19,558 --> 00:37:21,800
Take him back to the hotel, please.

539
00:37:21,893 --> 00:37:22,804
Yes.

540
00:37:22,894 --> 00:37:24,886
Thank you, Mr. Fury.

541
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,937
And, uh, good luck.

542
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:30,395
See you, kid.

543
00:37:30,485 --> 00:37:31,566
Yeah, see you.

544
00:37:33,613 --> 00:37:35,400
- Bye, ma'am.
- Yeah.

545
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,909
Drink lots of water.
I'm gonna get you a vitamin C pill.

546
00:37:43,999 --> 00:37:46,867
- You cannot get sick, okay?
- Okay. Thanks, baby.

547
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,747
Hey, are you sure you're good?

548
00:37:48,837 --> 00:37:50,544
Oh, dude, I'm fine.

549
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,962
- Okay. Nice.
- Don't worry.

550
00:37:52,048 --> 00:37:54,882
Getting tranq'd in the neck by Nick Fury,

551
00:37:54,968 --> 00:37:56,821
probably the coolest thing
to ever happen to me.

552
00:37:56,845 --> 00:37:58,052
- It is pretty awesome.
- Yeah.

553
00:37:58,138 --> 00:38:00,300
- I'm happy I don't have to go to Prague.
- Seriously.

554
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:03,133
Good news. We're going to Prague. Huh?

555
00:38:04,102 --> 00:38:05,468
- What?
- Prague?

556
00:38:05,562 --> 00:38:08,555
Yeah. Tour company called.
They upgraded us.

557
00:38:08,648 --> 00:38:11,607
You should've heard me on the phone
with them. I really gave them hell.

558
00:38:11,693 --> 00:38:12,693
All I heard was crying.

559
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,778
- Look at our upgraded ride.
- Whoa, bro, you see that?

560
00:38:15,864 --> 00:38:17,025
It's pretty sick.

561
00:38:17,115 --> 00:38:20,654
- I'm impressed, Mr. Harrington.
- Oh, come on.

562
00:38:20,744 --> 00:38:23,327
Peter, what...? What's going on?

563
00:38:24,372 --> 00:38:27,615
I think Nick Furyjust hijacked
our summer vacation.

564
00:38:27,709 --> 00:38:31,043
I'm Mr. Harrington to the kids, uh...

565
00:38:31,129 --> 00:38:32,791
- Oh, all right.
- Okay.

566
00:38:32,881 --> 00:38:34,167
Awesome.

567
00:38:35,258 --> 00:38:37,045
Yeah. Awesome.

568
00:39:00,242 --> 00:39:02,655
Yo, what's up, Flash Mob?
It's your boy, the Big F,

569
00:39:02,744 --> 00:39:05,532
cruising through the Alps
with my private driver, Dimitri.

570
00:39:26,977 --> 00:39:29,720
"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you.

571
00:39:29,813 --> 00:39:31,520
Say EDITH."

572
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,643
<i>Stand by for retinal
and biometric scan.</i>

573
00:39:36,736 --> 00:39:39,604
<i>- Retinal and biometric scan accepted.</i>
- Hello?

574
00:39:39,698 --> 00:39:41,155
<i>Hello, Peter.</i>

575
00:39:41,241 --> 00:39:42,402
<i>I am EDITH,</i>

576
00:39:42,492 --> 00:39:46,327
<i>Tony Stark's augmented-reality
security and defense system.</i>

577
00:39:46,413 --> 00:39:48,120
- So he made you for me?
<i>- No.</i>

578
00:39:48,206 --> 00:39:50,619
<i>But you have access
to all of Tony's protocols.</i>

579
00:39:50,709 --> 00:39:53,417
- Cool.
<i>- Would you like to see what I can do?</i>

580
00:39:58,842 --> 00:40:02,802
<i>EDITH stands for "Even dead,
I'm the hero."</i>

581
00:40:02,887 --> 00:40:04,844
<i>Tony loved his acronyms.</i>

582
00:40:04,931 --> 00:40:06,047
Yeah, he did.

583
00:40:06,141 --> 00:40:09,225
<i>I have access to the entire
Stark Global Security network,</i>

584
00:40:09,311 --> 00:40:11,348
<i>including multiple defense satellites,</i>

585
00:40:11,438 --> 00:40:14,806
<i>as well as back doors
to all major telecommunication networks.</i>

586
00:40:15,942 --> 00:40:16,942
Whoa.

587
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:23,026
Is MJ texting?

588
00:40:25,785 --> 00:40:29,699
No. Don't look at it. Don't look at it.
That's wrong. That's wrong.

589
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:50,007
Petrol and toilets. Ten minutes!

590
00:40:50,101 --> 00:40:52,013
Flash Mob, this is what
we doing out here...

591
00:40:52,103 --> 00:40:54,220
Toilet, toilet, toilet.
Which way to the toilet?

592
00:40:54,314 --> 00:40:55,930
Ten minutes, everyone.

593
00:40:56,024 --> 00:40:59,233
Dimitri, where exactly are we?

594
00:41:01,363 --> 00:41:03,650
- Okay. I'll figure it out.
- Oh, my gosh, it's so sick.

595
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,901
It's beautiful.

596
00:41:06,034 --> 00:41:07,034
What?

597
00:41:14,586 --> 00:41:15,713
Toilet, toilet!

598
00:41:15,796 --> 00:41:17,297
Ooh. Ooh!

599
00:41:17,381 --> 00:41:18,465
What are those?

600
00:41:18,549 --> 00:41:19,633
Oh, my God.

601
00:41:19,717 --> 00:41:22,261
Toilet, toilet, toilet,
toilet, toilet, toilet. Up, up.

602
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:28,686
Hello.

603
00:41:28,779 --> 00:41:30,065
Close the door.

604
00:41:31,734 --> 00:41:33,115
Um...

605
00:41:33,522 --> 00:41:36,316
Oh, my goodness. Look at that weird candy.

606
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,236
I'm so into other people's culture,
and so, like...

607
00:41:39,486 --> 00:41:40,946
What are these? Are these chips?

608
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:45,325
It's a clear bag. It's obviously chips.
In fact, it says "chips" in English.

609
00:41:45,409 --> 00:41:47,494
These plates are so lovely.

610
00:41:48,037 --> 00:41:50,608
- So lovely.
- Where is this building?

611
00:41:50,865 --> 00:41:52,151
I'm Peter Parker.

612
00:41:52,241 --> 00:41:53,573
Take off your clothes.

613
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:56,735
- Excuse me?
- You told Fury

614
00:41:56,829 --> 00:41:59,196
Spider-Man cannot be seen in Europe.

615
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:01,373
So I made you this, another suit.

616
00:42:02,752 --> 00:42:04,414
Oh, uh, thank you.

617
00:42:05,421 --> 00:42:08,289
- I'm sure it fits fine. I don't need to try...
- Take off your clothes.

618
00:42:08,758 --> 00:42:09,758
Okay.

619
00:42:11,761 --> 00:42:12,761
Sure.

620
00:42:14,764 --> 00:42:16,721
- It's a little embarrassing.
- Now. Hurry up.

621
00:42:16,807 --> 00:42:19,140
This is weird.

622
00:42:21,854 --> 00:42:23,971
- No, no, no. Don't...
- Whoa!

623
00:42:25,816 --> 00:42:26,647
Uh...

624
00:42:26,734 --> 00:42:30,603
- Sorry. I thought this was the bathroom.
- This is not what it looks like.

625
00:42:30,696 --> 00:42:31,903
- Just...
- Yeah.

626
00:42:31,989 --> 00:42:33,855
- What are you doing?
- I'll leave you alone.

627
00:42:33,949 --> 00:42:37,738
Oh, my God. Don't shoot anybody.
Brad? It's not what it looks like, buddy.

628
00:42:38,412 --> 00:42:40,244
- Hey, man, look, that's...
- Look, Peter,

629
00:42:40,331 --> 00:42:42,323
I'm not here to judge
your life choices, dude.

630
00:42:42,416 --> 00:42:45,705
If you want to hook up with some
random European chick, that's on you.

631
00:42:45,795 --> 00:42:48,629
- That's not what that was.
- I can't pretend I didn't see what I saw.

632
00:42:48,714 --> 00:42:51,001
I know you're trying
to get with MJ. It's obvious.

633
00:42:51,091 --> 00:42:53,253
- But I like her too.
- Wait a minute. Hey, hey.

634
00:42:53,344 --> 00:42:56,587
- You cannot show her that photo, dude.
- I'm sorry, man. I have to.

635
00:42:57,264 --> 00:42:58,630
She deserves the truth.

636
00:42:59,767 --> 00:43:02,054
Okay, put your one foot
in front of the other,

637
00:43:02,144 --> 00:43:04,056
and, everybody, back on the bus.

638
00:43:04,146 --> 00:43:06,103
It's been 10 minutes. Let's go!

639
00:43:10,778 --> 00:43:13,191
What's up, Flash Mob?
It's your boy, Big F...

640
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,897
- EDITH?
<i>- Hello, Peter. How can I help you?</i>

641
00:43:15,991 --> 00:43:18,950
Hey. There's this guy in my class
who's gonna ruin everything with MJ...

642
00:43:19,036 --> 00:43:22,245
<i>Peter, I'm having difficulty hearing you.
Can you please speak up?</i>

643
00:43:22,873 --> 00:43:25,240
Um, Brad Davis. He has a photo of me.

644
00:43:25,334 --> 00:43:27,371
<i>Brad Davis. Is he a target?</i>

645
00:43:27,461 --> 00:43:28,827
Is Brad a target? Um...

646
00:43:34,426 --> 00:43:37,544
- Yeah. He's a target. He's a target.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

647
00:43:37,638 --> 00:43:40,722
<i>Target is Brad Davis. Initiating strike.</i>

648
00:43:40,808 --> 00:43:43,050
- Initiating what, now?
<i>- Intercept point determined.</i>

649
00:43:43,143 --> 00:43:45,009
<i>- Releasing kill vehicle.</i>
- EDITH.

650
00:44:08,669 --> 00:44:10,752
- Oh, my God.
- Dope glasses, Parker.

651
00:44:10,838 --> 00:44:12,955
- How'd you pay for these?
- Flash, give them back.

652
00:44:13,048 --> 00:44:15,288
- I'm really paying you a compliment.
- Please give me...

653
00:44:16,552 --> 00:44:17,552
I'm so sorry.

654
00:44:19,805 --> 00:44:22,047
- EDITH, don't kill Brad.
<i>- Do you want me to cancel</i>

655
00:44:22,141 --> 00:44:24,554
<i>- the drone strike on Brad Davis?</i>
- Did you punch Flash?

656
00:44:24,643 --> 00:44:26,305
- No.
<i>- Firing.</i>

657
00:44:29,273 --> 00:44:30,855
Oh, look out!

658
00:44:34,528 --> 00:44:36,315
Hey, this is not the autobahn!

659
00:44:36,405 --> 00:44:37,771
- EDITH.
- Harrington!

660
00:44:37,865 --> 00:44:40,073
- Is this the autobahn?
- Appears to be.

661
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:43,460
<i>- Commencing second strike.</i>
- Peter.

662
00:44:43,495 --> 00:44:46,488
- Plant your fanny and buckle up now.
- Look at the baby mountain goats!

663
00:44:46,582 --> 00:44:48,744
- Baby mountain goats?
- I see them.

664
00:45:03,057 --> 00:45:05,265
I don't see any mountain goats.

665
00:45:05,351 --> 00:45:06,808
You missed them.

666
00:45:06,894 --> 00:45:09,307
I know you think none of us
have noticed, Peter...

667
00:45:09,396 --> 00:45:10,396
What?

668
00:45:10,814 --> 00:45:13,306
...but your new look, I love it.

669
00:45:14,068 --> 00:45:15,309
- Right, babe?
- Thanks.

670
00:45:15,402 --> 00:45:18,315
Yeah. Sophisticated, classy,
very European.

671
00:45:18,405 --> 00:45:19,405
Oh, man.

672
00:45:20,908 --> 00:45:22,615
Let's try that again.

673
00:45:23,702 --> 00:45:25,989
This is so weird.
It was right here on my phone.

674
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,572
- I...
- Yeah. Weird.

675
00:45:35,005 --> 00:45:35,836
Ow.

676
00:45:58,153 --> 00:46:00,987
- Whoa, freaking beautiful.
- This is amazing.

677
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:03,482
Wow, this place is so classy.

678
00:46:03,575 --> 00:46:05,066
Yeah, so why are we here?

679
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,867
Speak for yourself.

680
00:46:06,954 --> 00:46:08,490
I'm home.

681
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,162
What can I say?

682
00:46:10,249 --> 00:46:12,491
The squeaky wheel gets
the upgrade grease.

683
00:46:12,584 --> 00:46:16,203
Everyone get settled, rest up
because tonight, big surprise,

684
00:46:16,296 --> 00:46:18,879
is Prague's annual Carnival of Lights.

685
00:46:19,967 --> 00:46:21,208
- Yeah!
- Hello?

686
00:46:21,301 --> 00:46:23,714
<i>Parker, it's Hill.
There's an earpiece with your suit.</i>

687
00:46:23,804 --> 00:46:26,137
<i>Put it on and await further instructions.
Understood?</i>

688
00:46:26,223 --> 00:46:27,054
Yes, ma'am.

689
00:46:27,141 --> 00:46:28,427
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Hey, man.

690
00:46:28,517 --> 00:46:30,759
- Hey.
- Look, I am so sorry

691
00:46:30,853 --> 00:46:33,596
if I seem like I'm preoccupied
with my relationship.

692
00:46:33,689 --> 00:46:36,807
- I'm still your guy in the chair.
- No, it's all good. Don't worry about it.

693
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,608
- Okay. Great, great.
- It's fine.

694
00:46:39,695 --> 00:46:42,028
So, what's the status
on the Elemental thing?

695
00:46:42,114 --> 00:46:44,697
- Where's it gonna happen?
- Uh... Here in the city.

696
00:46:44,783 --> 00:46:47,070
- We're here.
- I know. It's not good.

697
00:46:47,161 --> 00:46:48,368
I'm figuring it out.

698
00:46:48,454 --> 00:46:51,822
You have to do something, please.
We're counting on you.

699
00:46:51,915 --> 00:46:53,497
- Ned.
- Yeah. Yeah, babe.

700
00:46:53,584 --> 00:46:56,327
The good news is,
we've all got our own rooms.

701
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:58,207
- It's about time.
- Serious?

702
00:46:58,297 --> 00:46:59,913
<i>Parker? Parker!</i>

703
00:47:00,007 --> 00:47:00,918
Yes, sir.

704
00:47:01,008 --> 00:47:03,295
That thing is going to be here
in a few hours.

705
00:47:03,385 --> 00:47:04,751
Are we boring you?

706
00:47:04,845 --> 00:47:07,337
He's not bored. He's thinking
about how you kidnapped him.

707
00:47:07,431 --> 00:47:08,967
He had obstacles.

708
00:47:09,058 --> 00:47:10,924
I removed them.

709
00:47:11,018 --> 00:47:12,850
They still won't evacuate the city.

710
00:47:14,063 --> 00:47:15,063
Idiots.

711
00:47:15,856 --> 00:47:17,392
So, what's the plan, Parker?

712
00:47:17,941 --> 00:47:21,309
I will be in the cathedral tower,
keeping watch for the fire monster.

713
00:47:21,403 --> 00:47:24,191
When that shows up,
I will radio you guys,

714
00:47:24,281 --> 00:47:27,365
- and then Mr. Beck and I will...
- My name is Mysterio.

715
00:47:30,496 --> 00:47:32,909
That's when Mysterio and I will move in.

716
00:47:32,998 --> 00:47:34,330
Peter, listen to me.

717
00:47:34,416 --> 00:47:36,999
The best hope you have, the only hope,

718
00:47:37,086 --> 00:47:40,579
is to stop it here now,
no matter what the cost.

719
00:47:40,672 --> 00:47:42,664
Maneuver it away
from civilians if you can,

720
00:47:42,758 --> 00:47:45,626
but most important,
keep it away from metal.

721
00:47:45,719 --> 00:47:49,258
If it gets too big, it'll draw power
from the Earth's core.

722
00:47:49,348 --> 00:47:52,216
After that, there's no way to stop it.

723
00:47:56,647 --> 00:47:58,309
Hey, my friends are here.

724
00:47:58,398 --> 00:48:00,560
I can't help but think
we're putting them in danger.

725
00:48:00,651 --> 00:48:03,735
You're worried about us
hurting your friends?

726
00:48:03,821 --> 00:48:08,156
You, who called a drone strike
on your own school tour bus?

727
00:48:08,951 --> 00:48:14,618
Stark gave you a multibillion-dollar
A.R. tactical intelligence system,

728
00:48:14,706 --> 00:48:17,619
and the first thing you do with it is try
and blow up your friends.

729
00:48:17,709 --> 00:48:22,704
It's clear to me
that you were not ready for this.

730
00:48:29,638 --> 00:48:32,051
Fury asked me to come up here
and see how you were doing.

731
00:48:32,141 --> 00:48:34,053
He just...
He felt bad about snapping at you.

732
00:48:34,143 --> 00:48:35,179
Really?

733
00:48:35,602 --> 00:48:38,094
You guys do have sarcasm
on this Earth, right?

734
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:40,976
How you feeling?

735
00:48:43,443 --> 00:48:44,479
Uh...

736
00:48:45,654 --> 00:48:49,273
I didn't think I was gonna have
to save the world this summer.

737
00:48:49,366 --> 00:48:51,779
I know that makes me sound
like such a jerk. I just...

738
00:48:53,245 --> 00:48:56,784
I had this plan with this girl
that I really like...

739
00:48:56,874 --> 00:48:59,082
and now it's all ruined.

740
00:49:06,508 --> 00:49:08,921
You're not a jerk
for wanting a normal life, kid.

741
00:49:11,054 --> 00:49:12,465
It's a hard path.

742
00:49:13,223 --> 00:49:16,307
You see things. You do things.
You make choices.

743
00:49:17,561 --> 00:49:19,268
People look up to you...

744
00:49:20,856 --> 00:49:23,269
and even if you win a battle,
sometimes they die.

745
00:49:24,151 --> 00:49:26,359
I like you, Peter. You're a good kid.

746
00:49:27,863 --> 00:49:31,607
There's a part of me
that wants me to tell you, just...

747
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,532
turn around, run away from all this.

748
00:49:33,619 --> 00:49:37,613
Then there's another part of me
that knows what we're about to fight,

749
00:49:37,706 --> 00:49:40,414
what's at stake,
and I'm glad you're here.

750
00:49:42,377 --> 00:49:43,377
Me too.

751
00:49:43,462 --> 00:49:45,749
But you're worried about your friends.

752
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:46,839
Yeah.

753
00:49:47,716 --> 00:49:50,550
Just always feel like
I'm putting them in danger.

754
00:49:50,636 --> 00:49:55,848
Look, just get them inside and keep them
in a safe place for just a few hours.

755
00:49:55,933 --> 00:49:56,933
They'll be all right.

756
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:03,351
It's really nice to have somebody to talk to
about superhero stuff, you know?

757
00:50:04,942 --> 00:50:05,942
Anytime.

758
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:10,980
And, hey, we survive this,
you'll have all summer to kill Brad.

759
00:50:14,576 --> 00:50:15,987
See you out there.

760
00:50:16,078 --> 00:50:17,078
All right.

761
00:50:22,501 --> 00:50:23,992
Sorry, that's Italian.

762
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:30,373
Okay. EDITH? Oh, come on.

763
00:50:30,467 --> 00:50:32,333
<i>- Hello, Peter.</i>
- Hey. Uh...

764
00:50:32,427 --> 00:50:35,010
I need a way to keep my friends
inside the next few hours.

765
00:50:35,097 --> 00:50:36,804
<i>Let's see what we can do.</i>

766
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:38,552
Good news.

767
00:50:38,642 --> 00:50:40,224
We're going to the opera!

768
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:41,892
- You're kidding me.
- The opera?

769
00:50:41,979 --> 00:50:44,562
- Don't look at me.
- What happened to the carnival?

770
00:50:44,648 --> 00:50:46,105
This is upgrade living.

771
00:50:46,191 --> 00:50:50,105
Come on. The tour company
just gave us these tickets.

772
00:50:50,195 --> 00:50:53,154
For free! Do you have any idea
how much opera tickets cost?

773
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:57,610
No, because none of us have ever
wanted to go to the opera, ever.

774
00:50:57,703 --> 00:51:00,662
Uh... I think this is gonna be
culturally enriching for us.

775
00:51:00,747 --> 00:51:02,238
Thank you, Ned.

776
00:51:02,332 --> 00:51:05,325
Everyone, this is gonna be, maybe,

777
00:51:05,419 --> 00:51:08,207
the best four hours of our whole trip.

778
00:51:08,297 --> 00:51:09,708
Four hours?

779
00:51:09,798 --> 00:51:12,290
Guys, I think this is gonna be
really fun. Seriously.

780
00:51:14,594 --> 00:51:17,962
I bet now you're all happy
I had you pack a nice outfit.

781
00:51:18,056 --> 00:51:20,469
Yeah, because we'd much rather go
to a four-hour opera

782
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,516
instead of the biggest party in the world.

783
00:51:22,602 --> 00:51:24,389
Again, don't look at me.

784
00:51:25,439 --> 00:51:26,975
<i>Parker, do you copy?</i>

785
00:51:27,065 --> 00:51:28,431
<i>Comm check, one, two.</i>

786
00:51:30,485 --> 00:51:34,320
Okay, here we are. Beat the rush.

787
00:51:34,406 --> 00:51:35,942
Yeah, the rush out.

788
00:51:36,325 --> 00:51:39,318
Lucky for us,
we got the best seats in the house.

789
00:51:40,412 --> 00:51:41,448
Let's go.

790
00:51:43,081 --> 00:51:44,913
Hey. I'll save you a seat.

791
00:51:52,341 --> 00:51:55,459
- You look really pretty.
- And therefore, I have value?

792
00:51:55,969 --> 00:51:58,427
No, that's not what
I meant at all. I was just...

793
00:51:58,513 --> 00:52:00,004
I'm messing with you.

794
00:52:01,099 --> 00:52:02,931
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

795
00:52:03,018 --> 00:52:05,977
- You look pretty too.
- Thank you.

796
00:52:06,063 --> 00:52:08,555
- Oh, my gosh! Opera glasses!
- So cute.

797
00:52:08,648 --> 00:52:10,389
- Can I...?
- Yeah.

798
00:52:10,484 --> 00:52:12,191
Want to go in on a pair?

799
00:52:13,028 --> 00:52:15,611
- You mean, sit next to each other?
- Yeah.

800
00:52:15,697 --> 00:52:17,438
<i>Are you in position?</i>

801
00:52:17,532 --> 00:52:19,398
- No.
- Okay. No...

802
00:52:19,493 --> 00:52:22,076
<i>- Why the hell not? Parker?</i>
- you don't want to sit next to me,

803
00:52:22,162 --> 00:52:25,826
- or, no, you just don't want the glasses?
- I didn't mean that. Uh...

804
00:52:25,916 --> 00:52:28,329
If you go ahead, I'll go grab us a pair.

805
00:52:29,586 --> 00:52:31,248
I'll save you a seat next to me.

806
00:52:31,338 --> 00:52:34,046
- A lot of seats, so I'll be up there.
- Awesome.

807
00:52:35,092 --> 00:52:35,923
Okay.

808
00:52:36,009 --> 00:52:38,217
<i>- Parker.</i>
- No, I'm coming. I'm...

809
00:52:39,221 --> 00:52:42,840
Hey, I gotta go. Could you tell MJ
that I'm sick or something?

810
00:52:43,266 --> 00:52:45,132
Okay. Be careful.

811
00:52:45,227 --> 00:52:46,434
And whatever you do,

812
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,263
please steer the monster away
from the opera house.

813
00:52:49,898 --> 00:52:51,059
Yeah, Ned, I know.

814
00:52:51,149 --> 00:52:52,149
- Okay.
- Okay?

815
00:52:52,192 --> 00:52:53,808
- Yeah.
- Gotta go.

816
00:53:08,834 --> 00:53:11,793
<i>Parker! You better be on your way.</i>

817
00:53:11,878 --> 00:53:12,914
Coming.

818
00:53:19,219 --> 00:53:21,427
Where do you think she's going?
To the carnival?

819
00:53:21,513 --> 00:53:23,721
- Oh, I... I don't...
- We should go. Yes, we should go.

820
00:53:23,807 --> 00:53:26,265
Come on, let's go. Come on.

821
00:53:42,284 --> 00:53:44,776
All right. I'm in position.

822
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:48,284
As soon as I see something, Beck,
I'll... I'll let you know.

823
00:53:48,373 --> 00:53:50,456
<i>- Roger that.</i>
<i>- How's the suit?</i>

824
00:53:50,542 --> 00:53:51,783
The suit's great.

825
00:53:51,877 --> 00:53:55,041
It's awesome. It's a little tight
around the old web-shooter.

826
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:57,087
<i>- Parker!</i>
- Okay, I'll shut up.

827
00:53:57,174 --> 00:53:59,666
Oh, my God, babe, isn't this beautiful?

828
00:53:59,759 --> 00:54:02,092
Yeah, it's real beautiful, babe.

829
00:54:02,179 --> 00:54:05,422
- What's wrong?
- You know, honestly, I just...

830
00:54:05,515 --> 00:54:08,053
I don't do well with big crowds,
so maybe we should...

831
00:54:08,143 --> 00:54:10,931
I have the perfect thing. Come on.

832
00:54:19,738 --> 00:54:21,070
Don't worry, babe.

833
00:54:21,156 --> 00:54:23,489
We'll get away from the crowds,
get some fresh air.

834
00:54:23,575 --> 00:54:25,191
You'll feel a thousand times better.

835
00:54:30,707 --> 00:54:32,869
- Energy spiking.
- We have seismic activity.

836
00:54:44,554 --> 00:54:46,671
Okay, he's here! Beck, you ready?

837
00:54:46,765 --> 00:54:48,848
- You know what to do.
- On your lead, Spider-Man.

838
00:54:55,273 --> 00:54:56,273
No, come back!

839
00:54:56,358 --> 00:54:57,974
Come back and help us!

840
00:55:04,658 --> 00:55:05,899
You're up, kid.

841
00:55:18,672 --> 00:55:20,254
- Wait, wait. Is that...?
- Oh.

842
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:22,673
- Do you think that's Spider-Man?
- Uh...

843
00:55:22,759 --> 00:55:25,001
No, no, no.
It's a European rip-off version of him.

844
00:55:25,095 --> 00:55:26,836
I actually read about him. It's not him.

845
00:55:40,443 --> 00:55:42,435
No, Beck! He's got the carousel!

846
00:55:42,529 --> 00:55:43,736
He's getting bigger!

847
00:55:44,364 --> 00:55:46,105
What's his name? What's his name?
Uh...

848
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:47,781
It's Night... Night Monkey.

849
00:55:47,867 --> 00:55:49,278
- Night Monkey?
- Yeah.

850
00:55:49,369 --> 00:55:50,905
- Yeah.
- Night Monkey!

851
00:55:50,996 --> 00:55:52,988
- Yeah. Night Monkey.
- Night Monkey, help!

852
00:55:53,081 --> 00:55:55,289
- Save us! Night Monkey, we're stuck!
- What?

853
00:55:55,375 --> 00:55:57,116
- Oh, no, no.
- Help us! Help!

854
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,100
Are you okay?

855
00:56:17,105 --> 00:56:18,266
On to Plan B?

856
00:56:18,356 --> 00:56:20,769
Yeah! We gotta hit him
with something he can't absorb!

857
00:56:20,859 --> 00:56:23,397
I go left, you go right! Now!

858
00:56:39,336 --> 00:56:40,543
Okay, shoot him!

859
00:56:41,004 --> 00:56:42,004
Yeah!

860
00:56:44,591 --> 00:56:46,378
That hurt him. Keep it coming.

861
00:56:54,601 --> 00:56:56,558
<i>Spider-Man, keep your distance.</i>

862
00:56:56,645 --> 00:56:58,477
<i>I'm trying!</i>

863
00:56:58,563 --> 00:57:00,523
<i>Can't let him get near the Ferris wheel.</i>

864
00:57:00,565 --> 00:57:02,101
<i>Okay. I'm on it!</i>

865
00:57:11,701 --> 00:57:14,535
- Aah!
- Whoa! Whoa!

866
00:57:25,215 --> 00:57:26,581
Whoa, what is that?!

867
00:57:34,391 --> 00:57:35,848
Betty! Betty!

868
00:57:56,496 --> 00:57:59,455
That's it! Nice! Nice! You got him!

869
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,712
No, no, no.

870
00:58:14,097 --> 00:58:15,304
It's too late.

871
00:58:16,641 --> 00:58:18,633
Whatever happens...

872
00:58:18,727 --> 00:58:20,343
I'm glad we met.

873
00:58:20,437 --> 00:58:22,269
Beck, what are you doing?

874
00:58:23,523 --> 00:58:25,890
What I should have done last time.

875
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:31,896
Beck, don't do it!

876
00:58:36,536 --> 00:58:37,652
Beck!

877
00:58:57,974 --> 00:58:58,974
Mr. Beck?

878
00:59:02,228 --> 00:59:03,344
Oh, thank God.

879
00:59:12,363 --> 00:59:16,152
I would kiss you,
but I think I threw up in my mouth a little.

880
00:59:19,746 --> 00:59:21,282
I might have a mint.

881
00:59:22,999 --> 00:59:24,035
So it's over?

882
00:59:24,125 --> 00:59:25,866
That was the last of them.

883
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,044
But not the last threat we'll ever face.

884
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:32,714
We need to stay vigilant.

885
00:59:32,801 --> 00:59:35,293
There's a void in this world
for someone like you.

886
00:59:35,386 --> 00:59:39,255
Hill and I are going to Europol
headquarters in Berlin tomorrow.

887
00:59:39,349 --> 00:59:40,590
You should join us.

888
00:59:42,602 --> 00:59:45,390
Thank you.
I just might take you up on that.

889
00:59:55,782 --> 00:59:58,900
You got gifts, Parker,
but you didn't wanna be here.

890
00:59:58,993 --> 01:00:02,236
- Mr. Fury, I...
- I'd love to have you in Berlin too.

891
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:07,079
But you got to decide
whether you're going to step up or not.

892
01:00:08,211 --> 01:00:09,622
Stark chose you.

893
01:00:09,712 --> 01:00:12,546
He made you an Avenger.

894
01:00:12,632 --> 01:00:14,544
I need that.

895
01:00:14,634 --> 01:00:16,921
The world needs that.

896
01:00:17,554 --> 01:00:19,216
Maybe Stark was wrong.

897
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:23,807
Was he?

898
01:00:25,895 --> 01:00:27,386
The choice is yours.

899
01:00:42,245 --> 01:00:43,452
Let's get a drink.

900
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:48,369
I'm not 21.

901
01:00:55,425 --> 01:00:56,425
Hey.

902
01:00:59,137 --> 01:01:01,845
You gotta celebrate.
We did something good tonight.

903
01:01:01,931 --> 01:01:02,931
Yeah.

904
01:01:04,267 --> 01:01:06,133
Fury was right.

905
01:01:06,227 --> 01:01:08,685
Tony did a lot for me...

906
01:01:08,771 --> 01:01:10,763
so I owe it to him, to everybody.

907
01:01:11,608 --> 01:01:12,724
Do you?

908
01:01:12,817 --> 01:01:14,809
Yeah. I mean...

909
01:01:16,613 --> 01:01:19,276
Mr. Stark gave me
the chance to be more.

910
01:01:19,365 --> 01:01:21,197
He wanted me to be better than him.

911
01:01:21,284 --> 01:01:24,277
- And Fury wants me to live up to that.
- What do you want?

912
01:01:24,829 --> 01:01:26,946
- What do you mean?
- What do you want?

913
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,583
- I don't know.
- What do you want? Peter Parker. Now.

914
01:01:31,669 --> 01:01:34,412
- I know you're thinking about it.
- I wanna go on my trip.

915
01:01:34,505 --> 01:01:36,792
I want to go back on my trip
with my friends.

916
01:01:36,883 --> 01:01:39,967
And go to the top of the Eiffel Tower

917
01:01:40,053 --> 01:01:43,421
with the girl who I really like
and tell her how I feel...

918
01:01:45,183 --> 01:01:47,266
- and give her a kiss.
- Oh.

919
01:01:47,352 --> 01:01:48,352
Shut up, man.

920
01:01:49,354 --> 01:01:51,516
- You're not gonna do that, are you?
- No, I can't.

921
01:01:51,606 --> 01:01:52,437
Why not?

922
01:01:52,523 --> 01:01:54,515
Because I have too much
of a responsibility.

923
01:01:56,903 --> 01:01:58,769
- My God. Thank you so much.
- What are those?

924
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,942
- Are those the...?
- EDITH glasses, yeah.

925
01:02:01,032 --> 01:02:04,525
They were just on the floor? Try them on.
Let's see how they look on you.

926
01:02:04,619 --> 01:02:05,619
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

927
01:02:09,248 --> 01:02:11,160
I actually really like them.

928
01:02:11,250 --> 01:02:13,708
- Can I be completely honest with you?
- Please.

929
01:02:14,087 --> 01:02:15,544
They look really stupid.

930
01:02:15,964 --> 01:02:16,964
Oh.

931
01:02:17,465 --> 01:02:19,297
But maybe they have
a contact-lens version.

932
01:02:19,801 --> 01:02:20,837
You try them on.

933
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:22,634
- No, come on.
- Try them on.

934
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,882
- I don't wanna try them on.
- Just put them on.

935
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:34,096
What do you think, kid?

936
01:02:39,028 --> 01:02:40,860
"Next Tony Stark, I trust you."

937
01:02:42,198 --> 01:02:44,565
"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you."

938
01:02:44,659 --> 01:02:45,659
What?

939
01:02:46,244 --> 01:02:48,031
Stark left me a message
with those glasses:

940
01:02:48,121 --> 01:02:49,953
"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you."

941
01:02:50,039 --> 01:02:52,622
I'm still not following.
How many lemonades have you had?

942
01:02:52,709 --> 01:02:54,746
He knew every mistake I ever made.

943
01:02:54,836 --> 01:02:57,169
He must've known I wasn't ready
for something like this.

944
01:02:57,255 --> 01:02:58,587
Why give it to you?

945
01:02:58,673 --> 01:03:02,633
Maybe he didn't trust me to have EDITH,
he just trusted me to pick who should.

946
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:05,006
It makes much more sense.
He knew I'd do what's right.

947
01:03:05,096 --> 01:03:08,555
And he's not gonna give them to Fury
because Fury would give himself EDITH.

948
01:03:08,641 --> 01:03:10,052
You're probably right.

949
01:03:10,143 --> 01:03:13,307
Right, so the world needs
the next Iron Man.

950
01:03:13,396 --> 01:03:16,355
And it's not me.
I'm a 16-year-old kid from Queens.

951
01:03:16,441 --> 01:03:19,275
It needs to be an adult
with some experience

952
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:22,319
and that's good like Tony Stark, like you.

953
01:03:22,405 --> 01:03:25,443
No. Peter, come on. No.

954
01:03:27,869 --> 01:03:29,110
- EDITH?
<i>- Hello, Peter.</i>

955
01:03:29,203 --> 01:03:31,069
Hi. Yeah, um...

956
01:03:31,956 --> 01:03:34,869
I'd like to transfer your control
over to Quentin Beck.

957
01:03:34,959 --> 01:03:37,292
- Peter, what are you doing?
- Doing the right thing.

958
01:03:37,754 --> 01:03:41,748
<i>- Any transfer will require confirmation.</i>
- Stark gave you the glasses.

959
01:03:41,841 --> 01:03:45,255
Stark gave me a choice. It's my choice
to make, okay? And I'm gonna make it.

960
01:03:45,344 --> 01:03:47,677
You're a soldier, a leader.
You stopped the Elementals.

961
01:03:47,764 --> 01:03:50,757
You saved my life.
You saved the world, okay?

962
01:03:50,850 --> 01:03:52,466
He'd want you to have them.

963
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:54,096
<i>Waiting for confirmation.</i>

964
01:03:54,187 --> 01:03:55,187
Confirm.

965
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:00,561
Welcome to the Avengers.

966
01:04:08,993 --> 01:04:10,109
They look good on you.

967
01:04:11,996 --> 01:04:12,996
Thank you.

968
01:04:13,456 --> 01:04:14,456
It's an honor.

969
01:04:14,916 --> 01:04:15,916
Yeah.

970
01:04:17,502 --> 01:04:19,619
Mr. Stark would've really liked you.

971
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:21,880
Where you headed?

972
01:04:21,964 --> 01:04:24,672
- I'm gonna go find MJ.
- Good luck, kid.

973
01:04:24,759 --> 01:04:27,172
I'll give you a fifty-fifty chance.
You're pretty awkward.

974
01:04:28,596 --> 01:04:30,087
Yeah.

975
01:04:30,181 --> 01:04:31,922
- See you later, man.
- See you.

976
01:05:04,298 --> 01:05:06,005
See? That wasn't so hard.

977
01:05:06,092 --> 01:05:07,092
Yes!

978
01:05:08,261 --> 01:05:11,095
Somebody get
this stupid costume off me!

979
01:05:18,604 --> 01:05:19,469
<i>Okay, we got EDITH.</i>

980
01:05:19,564 --> 01:05:21,476
Get these connected to our system.

981
01:05:21,566 --> 01:05:23,979
<i>Toast! Toast! Toast!</i>

982
01:05:24,068 --> 01:05:26,651
No, this is a big win,
but we still got a lot of work to do.

983
01:05:26,737 --> 01:05:28,478
<i>Toast! Toast! Toast!</i>

984
01:05:28,573 --> 01:05:30,280
Yeah!

985
01:05:30,366 --> 01:05:32,733
Okay, toasts!

986
01:05:32,827 --> 01:05:34,034
Give me that, Doug.

987
01:05:34,579 --> 01:05:37,947
To the man who brought us all together,
our former boss, Tony Stark.

988
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,326
Boo!

989
01:05:39,667 --> 01:05:41,033
The jester king.

990
01:05:41,127 --> 01:05:45,622
Literally wrapped
in wealth and technology

991
01:05:45,715 --> 01:05:47,672
that he was unfit to wield.

992
01:05:48,217 --> 01:05:50,083
Like the holographic system I designed.

993
01:05:50,178 --> 01:05:52,886
A revolutionary breakthrough
with limitless applications

994
01:05:52,972 --> 01:05:55,180
that Tony turned
into a self-therapy machine

995
01:05:55,266 --> 01:05:56,097
and renamed...

996
01:05:56,184 --> 01:05:59,723
Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing,
or BARF.

997
01:06:02,982 --> 01:06:06,851
Oh, $611 million
for my little therapeutic experiment.

998
01:06:08,696 --> 01:06:11,734
<i>He renamed my life's work "BARF."</i>

999
01:06:11,824 --> 01:06:13,031
<i>I told him it was a mistake,</i>

1000
01:06:13,117 --> 01:06:15,279
that my technology could change
the world.

1001
01:06:16,871 --> 01:06:17,871
And then...

1002
01:06:18,956 --> 01:06:20,242
he fired me.

1003
01:06:21,584 --> 01:06:23,075
Said I was...

1004
01:06:24,462 --> 01:06:25,578
unstable.

1005
01:06:27,298 --> 01:06:30,006
- To Tony.
- To Tony!

1006
01:06:30,885 --> 01:06:33,673
- Next, to William.
- William!

1007
01:06:33,763 --> 01:06:37,507
Tony Stark was able
to build this in a cave!

1008
01:06:37,934 --> 01:06:40,176
With a box of scraps!

1009
01:06:40,269 --> 01:06:42,135
The integration of my illusion tech

1010
01:06:42,230 --> 01:06:44,472
with your weaponized drones
was brilliant.

1011
01:06:44,565 --> 01:06:46,898
Powerful illusions, real damage,
worked like a charm.

1012
01:06:46,984 --> 01:06:48,316
And it's just the beginning.

1013
01:06:48,402 --> 01:06:50,359
- Thank you, brother.
- To Guterman.

1014
01:06:50,446 --> 01:06:51,757
- Guterman!
- To Guterman!

1015
01:06:51,781 --> 01:06:54,774
The story you created of a soldier
from another Earth named Quentin

1016
01:06:54,867 --> 01:06:58,031
fighting space monsters
in Europe is totally ridiculous

1017
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:00,828
and apparently the kind of thing
people will believe right now.

1018
01:07:00,915 --> 01:07:02,622
I mean, everybody bought it.

1019
01:07:02,708 --> 01:07:04,119
- Gutes!
- Guterman!

1020
01:07:04,210 --> 01:07:06,372
- To Victoria.
- To Victoria!

1021
01:07:06,462 --> 01:07:08,624
Staging electromagnetic pulses
at each attack site

1022
01:07:08,714 --> 01:07:10,876
so Fury's own satellites
would confirm our lies.

1023
01:07:10,967 --> 01:07:12,333
Inspired idea.

1024
01:07:12,426 --> 01:07:14,839
- To Janice.
- Janice!

1025
01:07:14,929 --> 01:07:17,342
After Tony died, she was the one
who discovered that EDITH

1026
01:07:17,431 --> 01:07:21,300
was being handed over not to us,
not to the Defense Department,

1027
01:07:21,394 --> 01:07:22,394
but to a child.

1028
01:07:22,436 --> 01:07:24,018
- Thank you.
- To Janice!

1029
01:07:24,105 --> 01:07:26,939
And to the rest of you,
Tony Stark is gone.

1030
01:07:27,024 --> 01:07:29,937
There is a window of opportunity,
and someone will step up.

1031
01:07:30,027 --> 01:07:32,485
But these days, you can be
the smartest guy in the room,

1032
01:07:32,571 --> 01:07:35,154
the most qualified, and no one cares.

1033
01:07:35,241 --> 01:07:38,655
Unless you're flying around with a cape
or shooting lasers from your hands,

1034
01:07:38,744 --> 01:07:41,327
no one will even listen.

1035
01:07:43,374 --> 01:07:46,742
Well, I've got a cape and lasers.

1036
01:07:47,795 --> 01:07:49,878
With our technology and with EDITH,

1037
01:07:49,964 --> 01:07:54,834
Mysterio will be
the greatest hero on Earth!

1038
01:07:54,927 --> 01:07:56,008
Yeah!

1039
01:07:56,095 --> 01:07:58,758
Then everyone will listen!

1040
01:08:00,599 --> 01:08:05,094
- Not to a boozy man-child.
- No!

1041
01:08:05,187 --> 01:08:07,679
Not to a hormonal teenager.

1042
01:08:07,773 --> 01:08:09,890
No!

1043
01:08:09,984 --> 01:08:11,065
To me...

1044
01:08:11,152 --> 01:08:14,361
and to my very wealthy crew.

1045
01:08:14,864 --> 01:08:16,696
- To us.
- To us.

1046
01:08:16,782 --> 01:08:19,775
- To Mysterio!
- To Mysterio!

1047
01:08:19,869 --> 01:08:22,828
- To Peter Parker.
- To Peter Parker!

1048
01:08:24,081 --> 01:08:25,117
Poor kid.

1049
01:08:26,876 --> 01:08:28,083
Let's get to work.

1050
01:08:32,506 --> 01:08:34,293
- Peter, oh, my God.
- Hey. Hey.

1051
01:08:34,383 --> 01:08:36,625
- We almost died.
- It's fine. It's fine.

1052
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:38,460
Hey, I'm done with the mission.

1053
01:08:38,554 --> 01:08:40,796
- Dude, the trip's over.
- What?

1054
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:42,973
There's monsters coming out
of the ground.

1055
01:08:43,059 --> 01:08:44,766
Of course our parents want us home.

1056
01:08:44,852 --> 01:08:47,640
Don't put me on hold.
Peter, you're not dead.

1057
01:08:47,730 --> 01:08:51,519
Oh, my God. Yes, good.
Stay here. Don't... Put some clothes on.

1058
01:08:51,609 --> 01:08:52,816
We're booking flights.

1059
01:08:52,902 --> 01:08:55,144
We came for science,
we're leaving because of witches.

1060
01:08:55,237 --> 01:08:56,978
Welcome to the new Dark Ages.

1061
01:08:58,824 --> 01:09:01,407
- What is going on?
- We're going home in the morning.

1062
01:09:01,494 --> 01:09:03,781
No, no. All the Elementals are gone.

1063
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:05,737
- Ned.
- Coming, sweetie.

1064
01:09:06,415 --> 01:09:09,123
Hey, can you guys keep it down?
I'm live-streaming.

1065
01:09:10,669 --> 01:09:12,376
- Yeah.
- Hey.

1066
01:09:13,714 --> 01:09:15,751
- Hey.
- Where were you?

1067
01:09:16,133 --> 01:09:19,251
- Um, I got lost.
- We were worried about you.

1068
01:09:19,678 --> 01:09:20,509
Oh.

1069
01:09:20,596 --> 01:09:23,009
- Good thing you're back.
- Yeah.

1070
01:09:23,724 --> 01:09:26,467
- So much for Paris.
- It would've been fun.

1071
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,223
- Yeah. Night.
- Night.

1072
01:09:30,773 --> 01:09:32,059
You look ni...

1073
01:09:39,657 --> 01:09:40,657
Okay.

1074
01:09:41,534 --> 01:09:42,534
Oh!

1075
01:09:42,576 --> 01:09:43,783
- Hey.
- Hey.

1076
01:09:44,912 --> 01:09:45,948
Look, um...

1077
01:09:46,914 --> 01:09:51,705
I'm not ready for this trip to be over yet,
and I kind of want to do something fun

1078
01:09:51,794 --> 01:09:55,708
that's not on the itinerary or planned
or with Mr. Harrington.

1079
01:09:55,798 --> 01:09:57,539
Yes.

1080
01:09:57,633 --> 01:09:59,750
"Yes," like you wanna go?

1081
01:09:59,844 --> 01:10:01,005
Yes.

1082
01:10:02,346 --> 01:10:04,884
Awesome. I'll see you outside
in 10 minutes.

1083
01:10:04,974 --> 01:10:06,806
Meet me outside in five minutes.

1084
01:10:07,935 --> 01:10:09,392
- Five is good.
- Okay.

1085
01:10:09,478 --> 01:10:11,265
- Okay, bye.
- Bye. Heh.

1086
01:10:14,859 --> 01:10:17,852
<i>Night Monkey, help us!
Help! Night Monkey!</i>

1087
01:10:26,871 --> 01:10:27,782
- Hey.
- Hey.

1088
01:10:27,872 --> 01:10:29,238
Where do you wanna go?

1089
01:10:29,331 --> 01:10:31,072
- Who cares?
- Awesome.

1090
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,167
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1091
01:10:39,008 --> 01:10:41,500
- I'm glad we're doing this.
- Yeah, me too.

1092
01:10:41,594 --> 01:10:43,210
To see the city a bit.

1093
01:10:44,013 --> 01:10:46,756
They used to execute people
on this bridge.

1094
01:10:46,849 --> 01:10:50,763
They would put them in a basket,
and they would drown in the water.

1095
01:10:52,855 --> 01:10:54,812
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

1096
01:10:58,235 --> 01:11:01,728
There's this thing I've been wanting
to talk to you about

1097
01:11:01,822 --> 01:11:03,734
for a while.

1098
01:11:05,659 --> 01:11:06,659
Yeah?

1099
01:11:07,953 --> 01:11:09,569
It's our last night in Europe,

1100
01:11:09,663 --> 01:11:13,657
and I had this plan
that I wanted to tell you.

1101
01:11:13,751 --> 01:11:15,287
I'm just gonna tell you.

1102
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:19,587
- MJ, I...
- "I'm Spider-Man."

1103
01:11:21,258 --> 01:11:22,874
- What?
- That's what you were gonna say.

1104
01:11:22,968 --> 01:11:24,004
That you're Spider-Man.

1105
01:11:25,638 --> 01:11:28,472
No. I'm not Spider-Man.

1106
01:11:29,016 --> 01:11:31,633
I've been watching you for a while now.

1107
01:11:31,727 --> 01:11:34,014
It's kind of obvious.

1108
01:11:35,231 --> 01:11:36,231
I'm not Spider-Man.

1109
01:11:36,315 --> 01:11:38,728
What would make you think
that I was Spider-Man?

1110
01:11:38,817 --> 01:11:40,854
- Peter, Washington?
- Yeah?

1111
01:11:40,945 --> 01:11:44,564
The fact that you disappear
out of nowhere for no reason.

1112
01:11:44,657 --> 01:11:47,616
No, I was sick. Remember?
I had my... The tummy?

1113
01:11:47,701 --> 01:11:49,363
Susan Yang thinks you're a male escort.

1114
01:11:49,453 --> 01:11:51,786
What? Of course I'm not a male escort.

1115
01:11:51,872 --> 01:11:54,865
- Then you're Spider-Man.
- I'm not Spider-Man at all.

1116
01:11:54,959 --> 01:11:58,293
What about tonight? You snuck off,
and you fought that thing. I saw you.

1117
01:11:58,379 --> 01:12:00,792
You can't have seen me
because I'm not Spider-Man.

1118
01:12:00,881 --> 01:12:03,373
Also, on the news,
it was the Night Monkey.

1119
01:12:03,467 --> 01:12:04,924
- The Night Monkey?
- Yeah.

1120
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:07,002
That's what it said on the news,

1121
01:12:07,096 --> 01:12:09,429
and the news never lies.

1122
01:12:10,683 --> 01:12:13,596
- Night Monkey. Okay.
- What are you doing?

1123
01:12:15,479 --> 01:12:18,938
Well, do the Night Monkey
and Spider-Man use the same webs?

1124
01:12:20,150 --> 01:12:21,357
I mean, maybe.

1125
01:12:21,819 --> 01:12:24,027
Maybe he's a Spider Monkey.
Who knows?

1126
01:12:28,409 --> 01:12:31,026
Were you only watching me
because you thought I was Spider-Man?

1127
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:35,540
Yeah.

1128
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:38,707
Why else would I be watching you?

1129
01:12:40,796 --> 01:12:43,504
Doesn't matter. Just thought that maybe...

1130
01:12:49,638 --> 01:12:51,049
What the hell was that?

1131
01:12:52,850 --> 01:12:53,931
I don't know.

1132
01:13:05,154 --> 01:13:07,692
What is it, some kind of projector
or something?

1133
01:13:07,781 --> 01:13:11,070
Yeah, but it's really advanced.

1134
01:13:11,535 --> 01:13:13,447
It... It looked so real.

1135
01:13:13,537 --> 01:13:15,904
- It...
- Yeah, really real.

1136
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:19,999
- Wait, does that mean that...?
- The Elementals are fake?

1137
01:13:20,753 --> 01:13:23,541
That doesn't make any sense
because we were there, right?

1138
01:13:23,631 --> 01:13:26,669
There was fire and destruction, and...

1139
01:13:28,218 --> 01:13:29,629
Who would do something like that?

1140
01:13:39,563 --> 01:13:40,724
Mysterio.

1141
01:13:45,694 --> 01:13:47,060
I am Spider-Man.

1142
01:13:48,197 --> 01:13:51,861
- And I've really messed up.
- Wait. You're being serious?

1143
01:13:51,950 --> 01:13:53,657
- Mm-hm.
- You're 100 percent serious?

1144
01:13:53,744 --> 01:13:54,985
Because it's not funny.

1145
01:13:55,079 --> 01:13:55,990
No, I'm not joking.

1146
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,288
Because I was...
I was only like 67 percent sure.

1147
01:13:58,374 --> 01:14:00,240
- MJ...
- So why are you here?

1148
01:14:00,334 --> 01:14:03,293
- Why are you on this school trip?
- I know you have a lot of questions,

1149
01:14:03,379 --> 01:14:05,120
but we have to get out of here, okay?

1150
01:14:05,214 --> 01:14:08,332
Okay. Okay. I can't believe I figured it out!

1151
01:14:10,594 --> 01:14:12,256
You took everything from me!

1152
01:14:13,472 --> 01:14:15,008
This is for my family!

1153
01:14:21,689 --> 01:14:22,850
Pause.

1154
01:14:24,817 --> 01:14:26,479
- Pause.
- Oop.

1155
01:14:26,944 --> 01:14:28,060
Sorry.

1156
01:14:28,487 --> 01:14:31,070
Yeah, can you just fast-forward
to the end?

1157
01:14:31,156 --> 01:14:32,192
Yep. Stand by.

1158
01:14:36,870 --> 01:14:39,738
All right, fly, fly, fly, zap, zap, zap.

1159
01:14:39,832 --> 01:14:43,325
Pause. I'm not in love
with this choreography, but it'll do.

1160
01:14:43,419 --> 01:14:44,876
Kill image.

1161
01:14:44,962 --> 01:14:46,294
De-cloak drones.

1162
01:14:48,006 --> 01:14:49,167
All right, weapons.

1163
01:14:49,550 --> 01:14:51,507
- You want to weaponize?
- Yep.

1164
01:14:51,593 --> 01:14:53,334
Weapons only. Stand by.

1165
01:15:02,312 --> 01:15:04,520
- Nice.
- Stop.

1166
01:15:05,566 --> 01:15:08,274
Something. I don't know what it is.
It's something...

1167
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:12,821
Just dou... You know what?
Double the damage and then run it again.

1168
01:15:12,906 --> 01:15:14,397
You want me to double it up?

1169
01:15:14,491 --> 01:15:15,857
- Yeah.
- All right.

1170
01:15:16,243 --> 01:15:17,243
Cover your ears.

1171
01:15:25,878 --> 01:15:28,461
Whoo! That is good! That's good.

1172
01:15:29,381 --> 01:15:31,088
- We on schedule?
- Oh, yeah.

1173
01:15:31,175 --> 01:15:33,667
Uploading software hack
to EDITH network.

1174
01:15:33,761 --> 01:15:37,175
With her drones, we'll create an event
big enough to cover an entire city.

1175
01:15:37,264 --> 01:15:38,175
All right, well done.

1176
01:15:38,265 --> 01:15:40,848
Make sure every drone is weapons-hot.
We need maximum damage.

1177
01:15:40,934 --> 01:15:43,392
- That is gonna cause a lot of casualties.
- Oh, yeah.

1178
01:15:43,479 --> 01:15:46,142
More casualties, more coverage.
I gotta cut through the static.

1179
01:15:46,231 --> 01:15:49,269
London is a beautiful city,
and it will suffer, but they can rebuild.

1180
01:15:49,359 --> 01:15:50,975
If I'm the next Iron Man,

1181
01:15:51,069 --> 01:15:54,278
I need to save the world
from an Avengers-level threat.

1182
01:15:55,282 --> 01:15:58,616
But when its new savior descends,

1183
01:15:58,702 --> 01:16:01,240
all those casualties will be forgotten.

1184
01:16:01,914 --> 01:16:05,123
Janice, you'll be in position with my
quick-change armor for the victory lap?

1185
01:16:05,209 --> 01:16:06,666
Of course. Do you wanna try...?

1186
01:16:06,752 --> 01:16:08,664
No, no, that's...
What's going on with my hand?

1187
01:16:08,754 --> 01:16:10,086
Why is that happening?

1188
01:16:10,172 --> 01:16:13,461
Oh, one of the drones that came back
from the plaza was missing a projector.

1189
01:16:13,550 --> 01:16:14,550
It's fine.

1190
01:16:15,052 --> 01:16:17,886
Wait, and you're...?
You're telling me this now?

1191
01:16:18,597 --> 01:16:20,213
It's... It's one drone.

1192
01:16:20,307 --> 01:16:23,141
- The image will be perfect, I promise.
- That projector is evidence.

1193
01:16:23,227 --> 01:16:26,265
It's going to tell people what we're doing
and how we're doing it.

1194
01:16:26,355 --> 01:16:30,019
I am trying to fool 7 billion people here,
including Nick Fury,

1195
01:16:30,108 --> 01:16:33,567
who happens to be the most paranoid
and most dangerous person on the planet.

1196
01:16:33,654 --> 01:16:36,863
If he catches on before I've killed him,
he will put a bullet in my head.

1197
01:16:36,949 --> 01:16:39,282
And nobody wants a bullet
in their head, right?

1198
01:16:41,537 --> 01:16:42,537
Right?

1199
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:46,906
William, can you look at me?

1200
01:16:49,086 --> 01:16:50,202
Pull up EDITH.

1201
01:16:52,172 --> 01:16:53,172
<i>Hello, Quentin.</i>

1202
01:16:53,257 --> 01:16:57,092
Hi, honey. I need a level-five search,
full-resource protocol for this device.

1203
01:16:57,177 --> 01:16:58,213
<i>Magnifying.</i>

1204
01:16:59,471 --> 01:17:01,929
There. Search everything going in
and out of that building.

1205
01:17:03,058 --> 01:17:04,058
<i>Located.</i>

1206
01:17:05,727 --> 01:17:06,727
Shit.

1207
01:17:09,940 --> 01:17:11,977
You know, William, one day,

1208
01:17:12,067 --> 01:17:14,525
after I've had to kill Peter Parker
because of this,

1209
01:17:14,611 --> 01:17:18,901
I hope you remember
that his blood is on your hands!

1210
01:17:22,244 --> 01:17:25,408
I can't believe I gave Beck those glasses.
How could I be that stupid?

1211
01:17:25,497 --> 01:17:29,161
He's probably spying on me right now
or sending a drone to come and kill me.

1212
01:17:29,251 --> 01:17:31,868
You had access to killer drones?

1213
01:17:31,962 --> 01:17:35,330
Yeah, I didn't really want them,
especially after I almost killed Brad.

1214
01:17:35,424 --> 01:17:36,960
You almost killed Brad?

1215
01:17:37,050 --> 01:17:40,964
Look, I have to call Mr. Fury
and tell him that Beck's a fraud...

1216
01:17:41,054 --> 01:17:44,172
- but I think he tapped my phone.
- So, what are you gonna do?

1217
01:17:44,266 --> 01:17:47,100
I need my suit, and I have to go to Berlin

1218
01:17:47,185 --> 01:17:49,017
and talk to Mr. Fury in person.

1219
01:17:53,901 --> 01:17:55,642
Just... Ahem.

1220
01:18:14,379 --> 01:18:15,745
Oh, Ned, perfect.

1221
01:18:15,839 --> 01:18:17,922
The costume looks great...

1222
01:18:18,842 --> 01:18:22,836
for the costume party
at the prince's castle.

1223
01:18:22,930 --> 01:18:24,387
She knows. I told her.

1224
01:18:25,057 --> 01:18:26,719
He didn't tell me. I figured it out.

1225
01:18:27,976 --> 01:18:29,012
Oh.

1226
01:18:29,519 --> 01:18:31,636
- That's cool.
- Like, a long time ago.

1227
01:18:32,272 --> 01:18:33,272
Oh.

1228
01:18:33,315 --> 01:18:37,309
- Look, Mysterio is a fraud.
- But he saved me and Betty's lives.

1229
01:18:37,402 --> 01:18:39,610
He's been faking the whole thing
with illusion tech.

1230
01:18:39,696 --> 01:18:42,279
Yeah, he's using these, like,
hologram projectors.

1231
01:18:42,366 --> 01:18:44,824
Whoa. That's crazy.

1232
01:18:44,910 --> 01:18:45,991
Yeah.

1233
01:18:47,996 --> 01:18:51,239
So you guys were working
the case together or what?

1234
01:18:51,333 --> 01:18:52,333
It's been mostly me.

1235
01:18:53,168 --> 01:18:55,706
Ned, I need you to call May,
get her to call Mr. Harrington,

1236
01:18:55,796 --> 01:18:58,129
say she wanted me to stay
with family in Berlin, okay?

1237
01:18:58,215 --> 01:18:59,547
Got it. Easy.

1238
01:18:59,633 --> 01:19:02,296
Wow, you guys lie with such ease.

1239
01:19:02,928 --> 01:19:05,887
- I gotta go.
- Wait, wait, wait. The projector.

1240
01:19:05,973 --> 01:19:07,384
You're gonna need this.

1241
01:19:08,642 --> 01:19:11,806
Don't tell anyone about this, okay?
Anyone who knows is in danger.

1242
01:19:19,861 --> 01:19:21,853
So you know too.

1243
01:19:21,947 --> 01:19:22,983
It's cool.

1244
01:19:23,073 --> 01:19:26,282
I've known first, and I've known longer,
but it's not a competition.

1245
01:19:47,848 --> 01:19:50,215
- Excuse me. Do you know where...?
<i>- Nacht</i> Monkey!

1246
01:19:50,308 --> 01:19:52,641
No, wait, I didn't... Oh, man.

1247
01:19:55,731 --> 01:19:56,731
Get in.

1248
01:20:03,155 --> 01:20:06,273
- Mr. Fury...
- You've got a lot of explaining to do.

1249
01:20:06,366 --> 01:20:08,528
- No, no, no, listen.
- Wait until we're secure.

1250
01:20:09,286 --> 01:20:10,197
Okay.

1251
01:20:11,705 --> 01:20:12,705
Ahem.

1252
01:20:15,792 --> 01:20:16,792
Right.

1253
01:20:42,152 --> 01:20:46,362
So is there anything you want
to tell us about your girlfriend?

1254
01:20:46,448 --> 01:20:47,939
He's talking about EDITH.

1255
01:20:48,033 --> 01:20:51,117
I know I made a mistake, and I'm sorry,
but he is not who you think he is.

1256
01:20:51,203 --> 01:20:54,116
Beck is a liar.
Mysterio, the Elementals, it's all fake.

1257
01:20:54,206 --> 01:20:55,697
He has some sort of illusion tech.

1258
01:20:55,791 --> 01:20:58,454
That's how he tricked you
and tricked me into giving him EDITH.

1259
01:20:59,002 --> 01:21:02,336
It's a projector. I pulled it off
the fire monster in Prague.

1260
01:21:02,672 --> 01:21:06,006
So all that death
and destruction we witnessed

1261
01:21:06,093 --> 01:21:07,709
was created by this?

1262
01:21:07,803 --> 01:21:09,920
No, not just this.
I think he's using drones.

1263
01:21:10,472 --> 01:21:15,183
Well, if this is true, then Beck's
very dangerous and we need to be smart.

1264
01:21:15,268 --> 01:21:16,930
Who else did you tell about this?

1265
01:21:17,854 --> 01:21:20,096
Parker? Parker!

1266
01:21:20,190 --> 01:21:22,682
- What's wrong?
- It's Beck. He's here.

1267
01:21:23,318 --> 01:21:25,355
What? Hill?

1268
01:21:30,659 --> 01:21:32,070
No, it's just an illu...

1269
01:21:33,328 --> 01:21:34,364
Fury!

1270
01:21:39,501 --> 01:21:42,039
<i>Wow, Peter, wow.</i>

1271
01:21:42,129 --> 01:21:44,166
<i>I thought we were close.</i>

1272
01:21:44,256 --> 01:21:47,795
<i>Fury always had to die, but not you.</i>

1273
01:21:47,884 --> 01:21:49,000
Stop hiding, Beck!

1274
01:21:51,763 --> 01:21:53,755
<i>I tried to help you walk away.</i>

1275
01:21:53,849 --> 01:21:55,841
<i>Now you're making me do this.</i>

1276
01:22:00,522 --> 01:22:03,230
<i>You told me, you were just a kid.</i>

1277
01:22:04,359 --> 01:22:07,648
<i>You told me, you wanted
to run after that girl.</i>

1278
01:22:07,737 --> 01:22:09,694
- Help me!
- MJ!

1279
01:22:10,782 --> 01:22:11,863
Oh, God!

1280
01:22:13,869 --> 01:22:16,987
- Peter, what's going on?
- I know this isn't real.

1281
01:22:17,414 --> 01:22:18,414
<i>Do you, though?</i>

1282
01:22:19,958 --> 01:22:22,575
- MJ! MJ!
- Aah!

1283
01:22:25,797 --> 01:22:28,289
<i>I don't think you know what's real, Peter.</i>

1284
01:22:29,634 --> 01:22:30,841
Whoa!

1285
01:22:41,563 --> 01:22:42,849
<i>You need to wake up!</i>

1286
01:23:06,171 --> 01:23:08,288
<i>I mean, look at yourself.</i>

1287
01:23:18,225 --> 01:23:22,720
<i>You are just a scared little kid
in a sweat suit.</i>

1288
01:23:23,939 --> 01:23:28,604
<i>I created Mysterio to give the world
someone to believe in.</i>

1289
01:23:29,069 --> 01:23:30,480
<i>I control the truth.</i>

1290
01:23:30,570 --> 01:23:33,313
<i>Mysterio is the truth.</i>

1291
01:23:56,930 --> 01:24:00,844
<i>If you were good enough,
maybe Tony would still be alive.</i>

1292
01:24:13,613 --> 01:24:16,822
<i>Deep down, you know I'm right.</i>

1293
01:24:27,961 --> 01:24:32,376
<i>You made your choice.
And all you had to do was step aside.</i>

1294
01:24:33,591 --> 01:24:36,425
<i>And now you have...</i>

1295
01:24:48,356 --> 01:24:49,847
Fury.

1296
01:24:49,941 --> 01:24:54,561
Beck's people are trying to find
everyone who could expose him.

1297
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:56,691
Who'd you tell?

1298
01:24:56,781 --> 01:24:59,615
- Um...
- I know you told someone, so just tell me.

1299
01:24:59,701 --> 01:25:01,408
- Okay.
- Who did you tell?

1300
01:25:01,494 --> 01:25:04,737
- Who else did you tell?!
- Just Ned and MJ from my class.

1301
01:25:04,831 --> 01:25:07,164
Maybe Ned told his girlfriend Betty,
but that's it.

1302
01:25:08,710 --> 01:25:09,710
What?

1303
01:25:09,753 --> 01:25:12,416
You are so gullible.

1304
01:25:12,505 --> 01:25:14,542
- What?
- You're smart as a whip.

1305
01:25:14,924 --> 01:25:15,924
Just a...

1306
01:25:17,010 --> 01:25:18,010
sucker.

1307
01:25:18,928 --> 01:25:21,215
- And now all your friends have to die.
- Oh, my God.

1308
01:25:25,977 --> 01:25:28,970
It's easy to fool people
when they're already fooling themselves.

1309
01:25:34,402 --> 01:25:35,984
But for what it's worth, Peter,

1310
01:25:37,781 --> 01:25:39,022
I really am sorry.

1311
01:25:48,583 --> 01:25:49,949
- EDITH.
<i>- Yes, Quentin.</i>

1312
01:25:50,043 --> 01:25:52,535
Access files to Peter Parker's class trip.

1313
01:25:53,797 --> 01:25:55,538
I need them to fly home from London.

1314
01:26:35,255 --> 01:26:36,255
Hi.

1315
01:26:37,424 --> 01:26:38,460
Where am I?

1316
01:26:38,842 --> 01:26:40,925
Municipal holding facility.

1317
01:26:41,010 --> 01:26:44,720
They said they found you unconscious
at the train yard. Very dangerous.

1318
01:26:44,806 --> 01:26:48,049
And we gave you the shirt
because you seemed a bit cold.

1319
01:26:48,518 --> 01:26:49,518
Thanks.

1320
01:26:51,771 --> 01:26:52,852
You guys are nice.

1321
01:26:54,190 --> 01:26:56,022
You speak really good English.

1322
01:26:56,526 --> 01:26:57,892
Welcome to the Netherlands.

1323
01:26:58,945 --> 01:27:01,278
- I'm in the Netherlands right now?
- Yep.

1324
01:27:03,032 --> 01:27:04,773
Bye.

1325
01:27:04,868 --> 01:27:05,868
Guard!

1326
01:27:06,411 --> 01:27:08,573
The guard is on a break.
Probably talking to his wife.

1327
01:27:08,663 --> 01:27:10,575
- Yeah, she's pregnant.
- Oh, yeah?

1328
01:27:10,665 --> 01:27:11,530
Yeah.

1329
01:27:19,507 --> 01:27:20,588
Yeah.

1330
01:27:21,342 --> 01:27:22,458
Yeah.

1331
01:27:23,094 --> 01:27:24,881
Night Monkey. Yeah.

1332
01:27:29,726 --> 01:27:30,887
You guys okay?

1333
01:27:43,490 --> 01:27:44,822
- Excuse me, sir?
- Yeah?

1334
01:27:44,908 --> 01:27:47,116
- Could I borrow your phone?
- Yeah.

1335
01:27:48,536 --> 01:27:50,118
Everyone is so nice here.

1336
01:27:50,205 --> 01:27:52,367
Uh... Okay.

1337
01:27:57,670 --> 01:27:58,670
Okay.

1338
01:28:00,548 --> 01:28:03,416
Pick up, pick up, pick up. Hey, hey, uh...

1339
01:28:04,761 --> 01:28:07,094
I messed up. I need a... I need a ride.

1340
01:28:08,348 --> 01:28:10,635
Where am I? Where am I, sir?

1341
01:28:10,725 --> 01:28:12,307
It's Broek op Langedijk.

1342
01:28:14,812 --> 01:28:16,849
Hang on. Could you say that into there?

1343
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:19,899
Hi. It's Broek op Langedijk here.

1344
01:28:20,902 --> 01:28:22,859
Yeah, no problem. Ha-ha.

1345
01:28:22,946 --> 01:28:24,482
Thanks.

1346
01:28:24,572 --> 01:28:25,572
Did you get that?

1347
01:28:47,011 --> 01:28:49,503
Peter? Are you okay?

1348
01:28:49,597 --> 01:28:52,385
- Happy, is that you?
- Yeah, of course it's me.

1349
01:28:52,475 --> 01:28:55,968
Stop! Tell me something
only you would know.

1350
01:28:56,437 --> 01:28:58,804
Only I would know... Uh...

1351
01:28:58,898 --> 01:29:00,685
Remember when we went to Germany?

1352
01:29:00,775 --> 01:29:02,607
You pay-per-viewed a video
in your room?

1353
01:29:02,694 --> 01:29:06,483
They didn't list the titles, but I could tell
by the price it was an adult film.

1354
01:29:06,573 --> 01:29:09,407
- And you didn't know how I knew...
- Okay, fine! It's you. Stop.

1355
01:29:12,495 --> 01:29:13,952
It's so good to see you.

1356
01:29:15,456 --> 01:29:17,698
You'll have to tell me
what the hell is going on here.

1357
01:29:18,710 --> 01:29:20,542
Okay, hold still.

1358
01:29:20,628 --> 01:29:21,835
There we go.

1359
01:29:28,261 --> 01:29:29,342
Ouch.

1360
01:29:29,429 --> 01:29:32,388
- I thought you had super strength.
- It still hurts.

1361
01:29:34,892 --> 01:29:37,009
- Happy, come on.
- All right, relax.

1362
01:29:38,980 --> 01:29:41,063
- Just a few more. There we go.
- Oh, my God, Happy.

1363
01:29:41,149 --> 01:29:42,856
- Relax.
- Don't tell me to relax, Happy!

1364
01:29:42,942 --> 01:29:45,355
How can I relax
when I messed up so bad?

1365
01:29:46,195 --> 01:29:48,357
I trusted Beck. Right?

1366
01:29:48,865 --> 01:29:52,404
I thought he was my friend. I gave him
the only thing Mr. Stark left for me,

1367
01:29:52,493 --> 01:29:54,735
and now he's gonna kill my friends
and half of Europe,

1368
01:29:54,829 --> 01:29:57,412
so please do not tell me to relax.

1369
01:29:59,417 --> 01:30:02,160
I'm sorry, Happy. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't shout.

1370
01:30:05,214 --> 01:30:06,671
I just really miss him.

1371
01:30:07,884 --> 01:30:09,125
Yeah, I miss him too.

1372
01:30:12,263 --> 01:30:13,674
Everywhere I go...

1373
01:30:14,932 --> 01:30:16,389
I see his face.

1374
01:30:16,476 --> 01:30:20,971
And the whole world is asking
who's gonna be the next Iron Man...

1375
01:30:23,816 --> 01:30:27,025
and I don't know if that's me, Happy.
I'm not Iron Man.

1376
01:30:29,072 --> 01:30:30,279
You're not Iron Man.

1377
01:30:31,366 --> 01:30:33,198
You're never gonna be Iron Man.

1378
01:30:35,161 --> 01:30:37,448
Nobody could live up to Tony.

1379
01:30:37,538 --> 01:30:39,029
Not even Tony.

1380
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:42,457
Tony was my best friend.

1381
01:30:42,543 --> 01:30:43,659
And he was a mess.

1382
01:30:44,212 --> 01:30:47,250
He second-guessed everything he did.
He was all over the place.

1383
01:30:48,174 --> 01:30:51,087
The one thing that he did that he didn't
second-guess was picking you.

1384
01:30:53,513 --> 01:30:56,722
I don't think
Tony would have done what he did

1385
01:30:56,808 --> 01:30:59,892
if he didn't know that you were
gonna be here after he was gone.

1386
01:31:01,854 --> 01:31:06,189
Now, your friends are in trouble,
you're all alone, your tech is missing.

1387
01:31:08,236 --> 01:31:09,693
What are you gonna do about it?

1388
01:31:15,284 --> 01:31:16,695
I'm gonna kick his ass.

1389
01:31:16,786 --> 01:31:19,779
But I mean, right now.
Specifically, what are we gonna do?

1390
01:31:19,872 --> 01:31:22,831
Because we've been hovering over
a tulip field for the last 15 minutes.

1391
01:31:22,917 --> 01:31:25,830
Right. I can't call my friends
because he's tracking their phones.

1392
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:27,502
Give me your phone.

1393
01:31:27,588 --> 01:31:28,829
- My cell phone?
- Yeah.

1394
01:31:28,923 --> 01:31:30,414
Okay. Here.

1395
01:31:30,508 --> 01:31:32,841
- What's your password?
- "Password."

1396
01:31:32,927 --> 01:31:36,136
- No, what is your password?
- "Password," spelled out.

1397
01:31:36,222 --> 01:31:38,384
Head of security,
and your password is "password"?

1398
01:31:38,474 --> 01:31:39,834
I don't feel good about it either.

1399
01:31:39,892 --> 01:31:42,930
<i>Hello, governor. Cup of tea for you?
I'm gonna be in London soon.</i>

1400
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:45,012
- They're in London.
- London, okay.

1401
01:31:45,106 --> 01:31:47,098
- Yeah, I need a suit.
- Suit?

1402
01:32:08,796 --> 01:32:10,037
Okay, um...

1403
01:32:10,840 --> 01:32:13,332
bring up everything you have
on Spider-Man.

1404
01:32:20,475 --> 01:32:23,138
Yeah, open that. Okay, no, no, no.

1405
01:32:30,359 --> 01:32:31,359
What?

1406
01:32:31,819 --> 01:32:33,276
Nothing.

1407
01:32:33,362 --> 01:32:35,854
You take care of the suit.
I'll take care of the music.

1408
01:32:39,827 --> 01:32:41,944
Oh, I love Led Zeppelin.

1409
01:32:47,376 --> 01:32:49,618
Okay, can you pull up my web-shooters?

1410
01:32:51,214 --> 01:32:54,924
Isolate the Taser webs,
and reconfigure and boost the voltage

1411
01:32:55,009 --> 01:32:58,047
to a factor of 25 percent,

1412
01:32:58,137 --> 01:33:00,925
and give me complete manual control
over detonation.

1413
01:33:01,390 --> 01:33:03,295
<i>♪ Forget the hearse 'cause I never die ♪♪</i>

1414
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:04,426
Now remember, everyone...

1415
01:33:07,221 --> 01:33:09,932
we need as much eyewitness footage
as we can get,

1416
01:33:10,015 --> 01:33:11,934
especially since
most of the usual civilians

1417
01:33:12,017 --> 01:33:13,577
uploading to social media will be dead.

1418
01:33:14,937 --> 01:33:18,482
Don't worry. I'll show you where
the exact strike zones will be, okay?

1419
01:33:19,942 --> 01:33:21,944
- Ready.
- Fire it up.

1420
01:33:33,997 --> 01:33:35,791
Like clockwork.

1421
01:33:38,710 --> 01:33:39,711
Fury.

1422
01:33:40,379 --> 01:33:41,547
Where are you?

1423
01:33:41,630 --> 01:33:43,215
On my way to you in Berlin. Why?

1424
01:33:43,298 --> 01:33:45,175
Another one of your energy pulsars.

1425
01:33:45,926 --> 01:33:46,927
What?

1426
01:33:47,636 --> 01:33:49,054
- Where?
- London.

1427
01:33:50,305 --> 01:33:53,100
What? No, that's... That's impossible.

1428
01:33:53,809 --> 01:33:56,478
It's imperative
that we take immediate action.

1429
01:33:56,562 --> 01:33:58,272
All right, all right. I'll meet you there.

1430
01:33:58,814 --> 01:33:59,815
You be careful.

1431
01:34:03,402 --> 01:34:05,779
Never apologize
for being the smartest one in the room.

1432
01:34:10,322 --> 01:34:12,735
Okay, the company set up a city tour,

1433
01:34:12,824 --> 01:34:15,862
and then we'll grab a bite
and head to the airport.

1434
01:34:18,288 --> 01:34:20,575
Is no one else going
to acknowledge how crazy this is?

1435
01:34:20,666 --> 01:34:21,952
Oh, yeah, I get it.

1436
01:34:22,042 --> 01:34:24,659
There's been nothing scientific
about this science tour at all.

1437
01:34:24,753 --> 01:34:26,415
No, I'm talking about Peter.

1438
01:34:26,505 --> 01:34:28,588
Has no one noticed how shady he is?

1439
01:34:28,674 --> 01:34:31,382
Because I saw him in the back room
of a rest stop with some woman

1440
01:34:31,468 --> 01:34:33,881
in his underwear,
and he's always sneaking away,

1441
01:34:33,971 --> 01:34:35,837
like back at the opera, huh?

1442
01:34:35,931 --> 01:34:39,299
Now he's suddenly off the trip,
with his family in Berlin?

1443
01:34:39,393 --> 01:34:41,851
Is no one else interested in the truth?

1444
01:34:43,146 --> 01:34:47,015
"The very concept of objective truth
is fading out of the world."

1445
01:34:47,109 --> 01:34:48,145
George Orwell.

1446
01:34:48,235 --> 01:34:49,476
- Thank you, MJ.
- Yeah.

1447
01:34:49,570 --> 01:34:54,190
Well, since Peter's not really here
to tell his truth, what about you, Brad?

1448
01:34:54,283 --> 01:34:56,525
Why take pictures of people
in the bathroom?

1449
01:34:56,618 --> 01:34:58,280
Yeah, what's that about?

1450
01:34:58,370 --> 01:35:01,078
No, no, no, it wasn't like that. It was...

1451
01:35:01,164 --> 01:35:04,328
- I was trying to take a...
- Let's just put all this craziness behind us

1452
01:35:04,418 --> 01:35:07,206
and have a nice, peaceful afternoon.

1453
01:35:07,296 --> 01:35:09,913
"Sounds great, Mr. Harrington,"
said the class.

1454
01:35:10,007 --> 01:35:11,248
Okay.

1455
01:35:11,842 --> 01:35:14,334
I'm gonna be a cool teacher right now.

1456
01:35:14,428 --> 01:35:16,920
You gotta stop doing that. It is weird.

1457
01:35:17,014 --> 01:35:20,678
No more photos in the bathroom.
Urinal or stalls.

1458
01:35:20,767 --> 01:35:22,303
- Okay?
- Look at this, guys.

1459
01:35:22,394 --> 01:35:23,930
Mr. Harrington, this is your bus.

1460
01:35:24,021 --> 01:35:27,480
- We got a bus all to ourselves.
- Nice to see you all. Come along.

1461
01:35:27,566 --> 01:35:29,669
- I'll get this, yeah? Why not?
- Thank you.

1462
01:35:29,693 --> 01:35:31,650
Yeah. Thank you, brother.

1463
01:35:31,737 --> 01:35:33,524
All right.

1464
01:35:33,614 --> 01:35:35,355
I have the kids.

1465
01:35:39,244 --> 01:35:40,735
I got here as fast as I could.

1466
01:35:40,829 --> 01:35:44,243
I did a full perimeter sweep. Nothing.

1467
01:35:44,333 --> 01:35:45,333
Damn it.

1468
01:35:47,711 --> 01:35:48,827
Pulse is spiking.

1469
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:52,129
- I'll take another look.
- Soon as you see something, report.

1470
01:35:52,549 --> 01:35:54,506
<i>You're all we've got, Beck.</i>

1471
01:35:54,593 --> 01:35:57,301
If this is what I fear,
then God help us, Fury.

1472
01:35:58,513 --> 01:35:59,720
God help us all.

1473
01:36:01,266 --> 01:36:03,223
Okay, people, no Avengers coming.
Good to go.

1474
01:36:03,310 --> 01:36:06,144
<i>- William, launch the drones.</i>
- Copy that, brother.

1475
01:36:06,229 --> 01:36:09,893
<i>Drones are entering
the atmosphere weapons-hot.</i>

1476
01:36:15,447 --> 01:36:17,939
- Excellent. Janice?
- Working on the cape.

1477
01:36:18,033 --> 01:36:20,696
Get those wrinkles out. I could be
shaking hands with the queen.

1478
01:36:20,786 --> 01:36:22,277
<i>- Guterman?</i>
- Almost in position.

1479
01:36:22,371 --> 01:36:24,954
- Okay. Hit it, Victoria.
- Increasing pulse.

1480
01:36:26,917 --> 01:36:30,035
Whatever this thing is, it's 100 times
bigger than the previous ones.

1481
01:36:30,128 --> 01:36:31,369
EDITH?

1482
01:36:31,463 --> 01:36:32,999
<i>Yes, Quentin.</i>

1483
01:36:33,090 --> 01:36:34,797
Show me my loose ends.

1484
01:36:35,550 --> 01:36:38,418
Once the show's going,
execute the kill order on my command.

1485
01:36:38,512 --> 01:36:39,673
<i>- Copy.</i>
- All right.

1486
01:36:39,763 --> 01:36:40,844
Start the show.

1487
01:36:42,808 --> 01:36:44,891
Let's save the world, people.

1488
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:49,016
I don't like this. Something's definitely up.

1489
01:36:50,065 --> 01:36:53,149
You're an FOS now.
"Friend of Spider-Man."

1490
01:36:53,235 --> 01:36:55,693
And you have to remember,
just stay calm.

1491
01:36:59,825 --> 01:37:01,316
That doesn't look good.

1492
01:37:01,410 --> 01:37:03,367
But it's fake,
there's nothing to worry about.

1493
01:37:03,829 --> 01:37:07,573
And the kids are in the kill zone.

1494
01:37:07,666 --> 01:37:09,032
<i>Great work, Guterman.</i>

1495
01:37:11,837 --> 01:37:13,829
- What?
<i>- Happy Hogan here.</i>

1496
01:37:13,922 --> 01:37:16,005
- I know. What do you want?
<i>- Over at Mr. Stark's,</i>

1497
01:37:16,091 --> 01:37:17,707
<i>going through his belongings.</i>

1498
01:37:17,801 --> 01:37:19,793
<i>- There was a surfboard you left behind.</i>
- What?

1499
01:37:19,886 --> 01:37:22,490
<i>People there said they didn't think
Nick Fury was a surfer, but I said:</i>

1500
01:37:22,514 --> 01:37:27,100
<i>- "Appearances can be deceiving."</i>
- It's not mine. And don't ever call again.

1501
01:37:35,026 --> 01:37:39,191
Fury's got the coded message.
Your friends are at the Tower Bridge.

1502
01:37:39,281 --> 01:37:41,568
Your boy called it London Bridge,
but I figured it out.

1503
01:37:41,658 --> 01:37:43,775
- I'll scoop them up, okay?
- Yeah.

1504
01:37:43,869 --> 01:37:44,989
- We're close.
- We're close.

1505
01:37:45,078 --> 01:37:46,444
- How's the suit?
- Almost done.

1506
01:37:46,538 --> 01:37:48,621
- Good.
- Wait, wait, whoa, whoa. Before you go...

1507
01:37:49,624 --> 01:37:52,162
if something happens to me,
could you please give this to MJ?

1508
01:37:52,252 --> 01:37:54,414
You'll make it back.
You'll give it to her yourself.

1509
01:37:54,504 --> 01:37:55,870
- Okay? You got this.
- I got this.

1510
01:37:55,964 --> 01:37:58,798
- Walk me through it.
- I know it's illusion tech.

1511
01:37:58,884 --> 01:38:01,797
All I have to do is get inside the illusion,
then I can take it down,

1512
01:38:01,887 --> 01:38:04,846
find him, and he's just a guy,
so I can take EDITH right back.

1513
01:38:04,931 --> 01:38:07,344
Right, but last time, you got hit by a train.

1514
01:38:07,809 --> 01:38:10,517
True, but this time...

1515
01:38:10,604 --> 01:38:13,438
How do I explain this?
Uh... I have a sixth sense.

1516
01:38:13,523 --> 01:38:17,062
The Peter-tingle.
That's what you're talking about, right?

1517
01:38:17,152 --> 01:38:18,359
It's not working, though.

1518
01:38:18,445 --> 01:38:21,188
- I heard it wasn't working right now. Is it?
- It is working.

1519
01:38:21,281 --> 01:38:23,819
- I don't know if it's working...
- So you got the Peter-tingle.

1520
01:38:23,909 --> 01:38:26,151
That's the plan.
I'm gonna go get your friends.

1521
01:38:26,244 --> 01:38:29,533
- You get that Peter-tingle back online.
- I got this.

1522
01:38:44,221 --> 01:38:46,884
- Cue the lightning.
- Cuing lightning.

1523
01:38:52,103 --> 01:38:56,347
Sir, is it still safe on the top,
or should we all come down?

1524
01:38:56,441 --> 01:38:57,441
Oh, my.

1525
01:38:59,277 --> 01:39:02,270
- What did the bus driver say?
- Bus driver's gone.

1526
01:39:02,364 --> 01:39:03,696
- What?!
- Where?!

1527
01:39:03,782 --> 01:39:06,616
It's okay. Mr. Dell and I have it
under control!

1528
01:39:06,701 --> 01:39:10,911
- Oh, no. Don't drag me into this, Roger.
- I'm doing my best, Julius!

1529
01:39:10,997 --> 01:39:13,330
- Look...
- Oh, the witches are back.

1530
01:39:13,416 --> 01:39:15,248
Oh, my God, get off the bus!

1531
01:39:20,549 --> 01:39:22,882
- Okay.
- Okay, follow me, kids.

1532
01:39:25,637 --> 01:39:27,799
Come on, let's go! Aah!

1533
01:39:40,026 --> 01:39:43,064
Now, that is an Avengers-level threat.

1534
01:39:59,713 --> 01:40:01,454
This way. This way!

1535
01:40:01,548 --> 01:40:03,005
- Okay. Okay.
- Oh, my God!

1536
01:40:03,091 --> 01:40:04,798
- Flash!
- Follow that cursed hand.

1537
01:40:04,885 --> 01:40:06,501
This way, kids. Follow me.

1538
01:40:06,595 --> 01:40:09,713
- It's not real, it's not real!
- It looks real to me!

1539
01:40:09,806 --> 01:40:11,092
Follow me, kids!

1540
01:40:12,142 --> 01:40:13,349
Earth, wind, fire, water.

1541
01:40:13,435 --> 01:40:16,348
Oh, no. Theyjoined forces
like the Power Rangers.

1542
01:40:16,438 --> 01:40:18,145
- You're thinking of Voltron.
- Who?

1543
01:40:18,231 --> 01:40:20,097
Voltron! You're thinking of Voltron!

1544
01:40:20,191 --> 01:40:21,978
Hey, look, it's Mysterio!

1545
01:40:22,068 --> 01:40:23,275
He's gonna save us!

1546
01:40:26,781 --> 01:40:28,568
If Mysterio knows we know...

1547
01:40:28,658 --> 01:40:30,741
- Then we're in danger.
- Yeah, and so are they.

1548
01:40:30,827 --> 01:40:32,068
We should go.

1549
01:40:33,496 --> 01:40:34,862
Kill that witch! Pa-pow!

1550
01:40:36,458 --> 01:40:38,996
This is for my family!

1551
01:40:40,670 --> 01:40:42,457
Get somewhere safe, Fury.

1552
01:40:42,547 --> 01:40:44,129
<i>I don't see this ending well.</i>

1553
01:40:44,215 --> 01:40:48,255
I appreciate your concern,
but I never leave my men behind.

1554
01:40:50,096 --> 01:40:52,053
All right, comms check.
Can you hear me, kid?

1555
01:40:52,140 --> 01:40:54,678
- I can. It's a little loud out here.
- I like the new suit.

1556
01:40:54,768 --> 01:40:57,886
- Thanks.
- Whoa, Peter, you sure that's not real?

1557
01:40:57,979 --> 01:41:00,471
Yeah, it's just 100 times bigger
than I expected.

1558
01:41:00,565 --> 01:41:02,022
- Still the play?
- Uh-huh.

1559
01:41:02,108 --> 01:41:04,475
We need to get high enough
so Beck doesn't see me coming.

1560
01:41:04,569 --> 01:41:06,435
Copy. Stay sticky.

1561
01:41:09,574 --> 01:41:11,657
- Hey, Happy.
- Yeah, kid. What is it?

1562
01:41:11,743 --> 01:41:15,157
We need to have a serious conversation
about you and my aunt!

1563
01:41:29,219 --> 01:41:31,256
Beck, report!

1564
01:41:31,346 --> 01:41:33,759
Guterman, I need a response.
Something quick and decisive.

1565
01:41:33,848 --> 01:41:37,216
"It's all the Elementals.
They're merged into something..."

1566
01:41:37,310 --> 01:41:39,302
...into something else.
Something more powerful.

1567
01:41:39,396 --> 01:41:41,388
It's drawing energy from the Earth's core.

1568
01:41:46,277 --> 01:41:48,143
See, now, that's some bullshit.

1569
01:41:51,449 --> 01:41:52,280
Is that...?

1570
01:41:57,372 --> 01:41:58,738
Be ready for anything.

1571
01:41:58,832 --> 01:41:59,913
Yeah.

1572
01:42:05,839 --> 01:42:08,252
Ah. It's not real, it's not real, it's not real!

1573
01:42:12,679 --> 01:42:14,386
Whoa.

1574
01:42:14,973 --> 01:42:16,134
That's awesome.

1575
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,992
William, I've got drones
breaking formation.

1576
01:42:44,085 --> 01:42:46,418
Maybe they hit a flock of birds.
You're fine.

1577
01:42:46,504 --> 01:42:48,504
I wanna see what's happening
Taking manual control.

1578
01:42:55,305 --> 01:42:57,388
<i>Do you see anything?</i>

1579
01:42:57,474 --> 01:43:00,512
Yeah. And I'm gonna kill him.

1580
01:43:05,148 --> 01:43:07,014
I hope this works.

1581
01:43:23,208 --> 01:43:24,208
You got me?

1582
01:43:29,297 --> 01:43:30,297
I got you.

1583
01:43:30,757 --> 01:43:32,498
<i>Boss, the illusion is coming apart.</i>

1584
01:43:36,221 --> 01:43:37,428
I see you.

1585
01:43:41,392 --> 01:43:43,429
- EDITH, give me protection.
<i>- Copy.</i>

1586
01:43:58,076 --> 01:44:00,989
- Just kill the illusion. Kill it.
- I'm not gonna kill it. They'll see.

1587
01:44:01,079 --> 01:44:03,537
They'll see what I want them to see!

1588
01:44:03,623 --> 01:44:06,582
- Do you still need the cape?
- Yes, Janice.

1589
01:44:06,668 --> 01:44:08,751
- I still need the cape.
- Done.

1590
01:44:11,631 --> 01:44:13,918
- William, render my illusion suit.
- All right, hang on.

1591
01:44:14,008 --> 01:44:16,170
<i>The monster was full of drones!
It's crazy!</i>

1592
01:44:16,261 --> 01:44:17,502
There you are.

1593
01:44:21,224 --> 01:44:22,305
Easy.

1594
01:44:26,604 --> 01:44:27,936
Who the hell is that?

1595
01:44:29,649 --> 01:44:30,765
- Ned!
- Happy!

1596
01:44:30,859 --> 01:44:33,146
I gotta get you guys out of here!
Get on the jet!

1597
01:44:33,236 --> 01:44:35,398
- Who are you?
- I work with Spider-Man, okay?

1598
01:44:35,488 --> 01:44:37,400
- Get on that jet.
- You work for Spider-Man?

1599
01:44:37,490 --> 01:44:39,777
I work with Spider-Man,
not for Spider-Man.

1600
01:44:42,996 --> 01:44:44,988
- New plan. Into the Tower.
- What?

1601
01:44:45,081 --> 01:44:48,040
- Happy, are you okay?
<i>- We're okay. Just get Beck.</i>

1602
01:44:48,126 --> 01:44:50,493
- EDITH, target Spider-Man.
<i>- Copy.</i>

1603
01:44:55,300 --> 01:44:57,166
I'll just kill the kids myself.

1604
01:45:11,816 --> 01:45:13,182
There you are.

1605
01:45:15,612 --> 01:45:17,274
Into the Crown Jewels vault!

1606
01:45:17,363 --> 01:45:19,275
- Yeah, go, go, go!
- Come on.

1607
01:45:23,203 --> 01:45:25,616
- Go!
- Into the vault! The walls are 8 feet thick.

1608
01:45:25,705 --> 01:45:26,821
Go into the vault!

1609
01:45:26,915 --> 01:45:28,201
- What?
- Into the vault. Go!

1610
01:45:31,252 --> 01:45:32,252
Take cover!

1611
01:45:51,356 --> 01:45:52,356
Okay.

1612
01:45:57,070 --> 01:45:58,070
Yeah?

1613
01:45:58,363 --> 01:45:59,854
<i>No. No.</i>

1614
01:46:04,118 --> 01:46:05,404
I see you.

1615
01:46:07,622 --> 01:46:08,622
Get that thing out...

1616
01:46:14,170 --> 01:46:15,331
Go!

1617
01:46:22,136 --> 01:46:23,798
How does Cap do that?!

1618
01:46:33,606 --> 01:46:36,815
Happy, say something,
to let me know you're alive!

1619
01:46:36,901 --> 01:46:39,188
<i>- I'm here. I'm here.</i>
- Happy, thank God.

1620
01:46:39,279 --> 01:46:40,770
I bought us some time.

1621
01:46:42,407 --> 01:46:44,194
- But not much.
<i>- I'm trying to get to Beck,</i>

1622
01:46:44,284 --> 01:46:45,946
but I can't shake these drones!

1623
01:47:00,842 --> 01:47:01,842
Gotcha.

1624
01:47:24,073 --> 01:47:25,234
Going up!

1625
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:03,652
Finally.

1626
01:48:03,738 --> 01:48:07,732
- Hey, William, how we doing?
- Illusion almost back up.

1627
01:48:07,825 --> 01:48:09,532
<i>I don't know how you're gonna spin this.</i>

1628
01:48:24,717 --> 01:48:26,003
Oh, great. No webs.

1629
01:48:39,690 --> 01:48:41,932
- Are we gonna die?
- Nobody dies on my watch.

1630
01:48:44,612 --> 01:48:47,355
I wasted my life playing video games,
and we're gonna die.

1631
01:48:48,241 --> 01:48:51,234
I have a fake ID,
and I've never even used it.

1632
01:48:52,161 --> 01:48:54,824
I post stupid videos daily
for people to like me.

1633
01:48:54,914 --> 01:48:57,531
Hey, if it wasn't for those stupid videos,

1634
01:48:57,625 --> 01:48:59,742
Spider-Man would've never found you.

1635
01:48:59,836 --> 01:49:03,500
Spider-Man...? Spider-Man follows me?
I saved us, guys.

1636
01:49:03,589 --> 01:49:05,296
If you saved us,
why are we about to die?

1637
01:49:05,383 --> 01:49:06,794
- MJ!
- Stop it!

1638
01:49:06,884 --> 01:49:08,250
I'm sorry, okay?

1639
01:49:08,344 --> 01:49:11,337
I'm obsessed with telling the truth
even if it hurts people's feelings.

1640
01:49:12,682 --> 01:49:14,765
I'm in love with Spider-Man's aunt.

1641
01:49:18,813 --> 01:49:20,270
We're sharing, right?

1642
01:49:59,353 --> 01:50:00,889
Your lies are over, Beck.

1643
01:50:02,106 --> 01:50:05,599
This certainly isn't ideal,
but I have contingencies.

1644
01:50:05,693 --> 01:50:07,104
EDITH?

1645
01:50:14,869 --> 01:50:17,361
Just give me the glasses.

1646
01:50:17,455 --> 01:50:18,571
You want these?

1647
01:50:20,750 --> 01:50:21,750
Come and get them.

1648
01:50:31,844 --> 01:50:33,380
Come on, Peter-tingle.

1649
01:50:58,120 --> 01:51:00,737
- Why aren't these drones firing?
<i>- You're in the strike zone.</i>

1650
01:51:00,831 --> 01:51:05,622
<i>- The chance of getting hit is...</i>
- No, fire all the drones now!

1651
01:51:23,980 --> 01:51:24,980
Beck!

1652
01:51:28,859 --> 01:51:29,895
Beck.

1653
01:51:31,028 --> 01:51:32,485
You lied to me.

1654
01:51:33,197 --> 01:51:35,359
- I trusted you.
- I know.

1655
01:51:35,908 --> 01:51:37,820
That's the most...

1656
01:51:37,910 --> 01:51:39,651
disappointing part.

1657
01:51:41,289 --> 01:51:43,246
You're a good person, Peter.

1658
01:51:45,459 --> 01:51:47,291
Such a weakness.

1659
01:51:49,338 --> 01:51:50,579
Stark was right.

1660
01:51:51,591 --> 01:51:53,002
You do deserve them.

1661
01:52:04,729 --> 01:52:06,391
You can't trick me anymore.

1662
01:52:10,401 --> 01:52:12,017
EDITH, turn off the drones.

1663
01:52:13,154 --> 01:52:16,488
<i>Biometric scan complete.
Welcome back, Peter.</i>

1664
01:52:16,574 --> 01:52:19,408
<i>- Execute all cancellation protocols?</i>
- Just do it.

1665
01:52:19,493 --> 01:52:21,359
- Execute them all.
<i>- Confirmed.</i>

1666
01:52:30,546 --> 01:52:31,627
Give me the spear.

1667
01:52:32,923 --> 01:52:34,130
That's a halberd.

1668
01:52:39,138 --> 01:52:40,138
Thank you.

1669
01:52:44,310 --> 01:52:47,678
- How could you do all of this?
- You'll see, Peter.

1670
01:52:49,315 --> 01:52:52,479
People, they need to believe.

1671
01:52:54,028 --> 01:52:55,394
And nowadays...

1672
01:52:57,782 --> 01:52:59,569
they'll believe anything.

1673
01:53:10,461 --> 01:53:11,461
Is he...?

1674
01:53:13,089 --> 01:53:14,205
Is this real?

1675
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:17,712
<i>All illusions are down, Peter.</i>

1676
01:53:32,858 --> 01:53:34,315
Whoo! Yeah!

1677
01:53:34,402 --> 01:53:35,984
Hey, where you going?

1678
01:53:43,703 --> 01:53:44,989
- MJ.
- Hey.

1679
01:53:45,996 --> 01:53:47,032
- Hey.
- Hey.

1680
01:53:47,123 --> 01:53:48,739
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay. Are you okay?

1681
01:53:48,833 --> 01:53:51,246
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Is everybody else okay?

1682
01:53:51,335 --> 01:53:52,667
Yeah, everyone's okay.

1683
01:53:54,213 --> 01:53:56,796
- What happened?
- There was just the drones,

1684
01:53:56,882 --> 01:53:59,590
and they were following us,
and then theyjust stopped.

1685
01:54:01,387 --> 01:54:02,923
- Was that you?
- Yeah.

1686
01:54:04,348 --> 01:54:05,348
Did you get him?

1687
01:54:08,602 --> 01:54:10,264
- Yeah.
- Well, I...

1688
01:54:11,731 --> 01:54:12,812
brought that.

1689
01:54:13,733 --> 01:54:15,474
In case you needed some help.

1690
01:54:16,026 --> 01:54:17,026
Thanks.

1691
01:54:19,238 --> 01:54:23,699
Anyway, uh, there was this sweaty guy
in the tower with us.

1692
01:54:23,784 --> 01:54:26,151
I think he works for you or something.

1693
01:54:26,245 --> 01:54:27,781
He...

1694
01:54:27,872 --> 01:54:30,114
- He gave me this.
- No.

1695
01:54:30,541 --> 01:54:31,541
No.

1696
01:54:32,835 --> 01:54:34,326
Oh, MJ, I'm so sorry.

1697
01:54:34,420 --> 01:54:36,537
- I had this stupid plan.
- Peter.

1698
01:54:36,630 --> 01:54:40,123
I wrote it down, I was gonna buy you this
and give it to you in Paris at the top...

1699
01:54:44,054 --> 01:54:45,386
And you kissed me.

1700
01:54:45,473 --> 01:54:48,056
- What? What?
- Yeah.

1701
01:54:48,142 --> 01:54:52,512
I don't really have much luck
when it comes to getting close to people.

1702
01:54:53,731 --> 01:54:55,814
Um... So I lied.

1703
01:54:57,777 --> 01:55:01,862
I wasn't just watching you
because I thought you were Spider-Man.

1704
01:55:06,327 --> 01:55:07,818
That's great.

1705
01:55:09,121 --> 01:55:11,704
- Black dahlia, like the murder.
- The murder.

1706
01:55:11,791 --> 01:55:13,828
- Good.
- Yeah.

1707
01:55:13,918 --> 01:55:15,534
Sorry it's broken.

1708
01:55:15,628 --> 01:55:17,790
I actually like it better broken.

1709
01:55:19,673 --> 01:55:20,789
I really like you.

1710
01:55:22,468 --> 01:55:23,959
I really like you too.

1711
01:55:38,859 --> 01:55:40,145
Okay. I should...

1712
01:55:40,236 --> 01:55:43,195
I should probably get back to the class.

1713
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:44,280
I'll go and...

1714
01:55:45,783 --> 01:55:47,319
- Yeah. I don't know.
- Okay.

1715
01:55:49,495 --> 01:55:50,611
Just in case.

1716
01:55:58,629 --> 01:56:00,086
Yeah, no.

1717
01:56:00,172 --> 01:56:03,415
No, May, you're right.
He did great. He was strong.

1718
01:56:03,509 --> 01:56:05,592
Yeah. I'm glad he stayed too.

1719
01:56:05,678 --> 01:56:06,964
I gotta go.

1720
01:56:08,556 --> 01:56:11,469
I'm glad you're alive.
I guess the coded message worked.

1721
01:56:11,559 --> 01:56:14,176
"Appearances can be deceiving."

1722
01:56:14,270 --> 01:56:16,512
I'm surprised you didn't
just wink in the camera.

1723
01:56:16,605 --> 01:56:17,641
It worked.

1724
01:56:17,731 --> 01:56:20,474
Only because I had serious doubts
about Beck from the beginning.

1725
01:56:20,568 --> 01:56:22,184
Not true. He had zero doubts.

1726
01:56:25,823 --> 01:56:26,823
Where's Parker?

1727
01:56:26,907 --> 01:56:28,239
He's with a girl.

1728
01:56:28,325 --> 01:56:30,908
I need to speak with him.

1729
01:56:31,620 --> 01:56:33,532
- He'll call you.
- He'll...?

1730
01:56:37,877 --> 01:56:39,914
Okay. Great.

1731
01:56:40,337 --> 01:56:41,794
Well, he better.

1732
01:56:41,881 --> 01:56:43,838
Or it's your ass.

1733
01:56:44,425 --> 01:56:47,384
And don't even think about ghosting me.

1737

Yeah, it's not like anybody

1738
01:57:31,824 --> 01:57:32,824
Ouch.

1739
01:57:33,201 --> 01:57:34,487
Except for me.

1740
01:57:34,994 --> 01:57:35,905
Aww. Thanks.

1741
01:57:35,995 --> 01:57:37,702

- You guys are so cute.
- Thanks.

1744
01:57:41,542 --> 01:57:46,788
Uh... I was thinking we should all go
on a double date or something.

1745
01:57:46,881 --> 01:57:49,464
- Oh, we broke up.
- Oh, we broke up.

1746
01:57:49,550 --> 01:57:50,882
No. What? Why?

1747
01:57:50,968 --> 01:57:53,335
Men and women grow apart,

1748
01:57:53,429 --> 01:57:56,388
but the journey they share together
will always be a part of them.

1749
01:57:58,184 --> 01:58:00,176
- You are so wise.
- Thank you.

1750
01:58:03,522 --> 01:58:04,522
Hello, Gerald.

1751
01:58:05,858 --> 01:58:07,349
Could Mother not make it?

1752
01:58:09,320 --> 01:58:10,320
Oh.

1753
01:58:13,866 --> 01:58:15,107
- May!
- I promise you...

1754
01:58:15,201 --> 01:58:17,443
Oh, he's here. Don't give me a ticket.

1755
01:58:19,956 --> 01:58:21,868
I'm so glad you're okay.

1756
01:58:21,958 --> 01:58:24,917
No, for real, I'm good.
I'm actually really fine.

1757
01:58:25,002 --> 01:58:26,868
Let's go. Where are your bags?

1758
01:58:26,963 --> 01:58:29,080
- Oh, right. They got blown up.
- Yeah.

1759
01:58:30,174 --> 01:58:32,507
- I got you some hot buttered bagels.
- Thank you so much.

1760
01:58:32,593 --> 01:58:33,504
I know my boy.

1761
01:58:34,681 --> 01:58:38,060
Um, weird question: What do you think?

1762
01:58:38,602 --> 01:58:40,270
Oh. Uh...

1774
01:58:57,248 --> 01:58:58,284
Are you dating?

1775
01:58:59,208 --> 01:59:00,540
- Yes.
- Not really.

1776
01:59:01,544 --> 01:59:03,331
- What?
- Well...

1777
01:59:03,421 --> 01:59:05,378
- I think...
- Summer fling.

1778
01:59:05,464 --> 01:59:07,456
Yes, that evolves
and grows like any other.

1779
01:59:07,550 --> 01:59:10,714
- I still don't know where it's going to go.
- Open to wherever it might lead.

1780
01:59:10,803 --> 01:59:12,840
- Anywhere. On or off.
- To share it with people...

1781
01:59:12,930 --> 01:59:16,844
- We'll always be friends, no matter what.
- I'm gonna go because I've got a date.

1782
01:59:16,934 --> 01:59:19,426
...because we all are interconnected.

1783
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:20,636
- Bye.
- We are.

01:59:39,373 --> 01:59:40,489

02:12:43,114 --> 02:12:45,106
The little boy handled it.

1850
02:12:45,200 --> 02:12:46,816
We helped.

1851
02:12:46,910 --> 02:12:48,117
- Talos.
- Come off it.

1852
02:12:48,203 --> 02:12:50,695
How was I supposed to know
that the whole thing was fake?

1853
02:12:50,789 --> 02:12:53,156
I mean, that was all very convincing.

1854
02:12:53,250 --> 02:12:56,869
The performances, the illusion,
that costume, the craftsmanship in that.

1855
02:12:56,962 --> 02:13:00,171
This is just embarrassing
for a shape-shifter. Fine.

1856
02:13:02,759 --> 02:13:05,126
Hey there.
I hope your mission is going well.

1857
02:13:05,220 --> 02:13:09,009
We gave the glasses to Parker
about a week ago, like you said.

1858
02:13:09,099 --> 02:13:12,558
And, uh, it was very touching, you know?

1859
02:13:12,644 --> 02:13:14,431
Really, really quite touching.

1860
02:13:14,521 --> 02:13:15,762
- Talos.
- Um...

1861
02:13:15,855 --> 02:13:20,145
And, uh, you know, shortly after that,

1862
02:13:20,235 --> 02:13:23,194
it really kind of went off the rails,
and so we need you to come back

1863
02:13:23,280 --> 02:13:25,442
because everyone kept asking
where the Avengers are,

1864
02:13:25,532 --> 02:13:27,023
I don't know what to say to that,

1865
02:13:27,117 --> 02:13:28,733
<i>so you're lucky that Spider-Man won...</i>

1866
02:13:51,516 --> 02:13:53,052
Everybody back to work!

1867
02:14:00,525 --> 02:14:02,437
Who's got my shoes?
