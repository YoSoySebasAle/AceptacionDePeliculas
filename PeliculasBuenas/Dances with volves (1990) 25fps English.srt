1
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,037
Is this the last one?

2
00:01:22,279 --> 00:01:24,873
I don't know.
There's no ether, either.

3
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,077
Jesus Christ.

4
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:30,199
You there!
Is this the last one?

5
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:38,757
God, what a mess.

6
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:41,595
At least there's no gangrene.

7
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:44,154
There will be
if it doesn't come off.

8
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:46,787
I can't saw if
I can't keep my eyes open.

9
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,158
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,947
Let's coffee up.
He can wait a few minutes.

11
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:35,393
- Is that Tucker's men?
- Yes, sir, I think it is.

12
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:37,837
How long has it been like this?

13
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:41,150
We just found them this morning.
They been here for 2 days.

14
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:52,998
Is that you, Lieutenant?

15
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,276
Hey, come on,
you better take cover.

16
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:06,838
These boys are shooters.

17
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,832
Go under cover.

18
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,877
You went to hospital?

19
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,317
It was no good.

20
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,357
What's going on here?

21
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,477
What's going on here...

22
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:31,790
is the question all right.

23
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,427
See, you could ask the major.

24
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,194
But he don't know, he's busy.

25
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,910
He's figuring out why

26
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,513
the officer's mess ran out
of ice cream.

27
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,191
And of course you got the general.

28
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:50,433
He came to see the show.
All he knows is there ain't no show.

29
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,390
The major is looking at
the general,

30
00:05:56,239 --> 00:05:58,275
thinking: "I better do something".

31
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:01,117
You know what that means.

32
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,032
I don't want to be
the first across this field.

33
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:06,713
They're supposed to be
beat up like us.

34
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,915
Tucker's men are as tough as cobs.

35
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,878
Only thing killed so far

36
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,950
is three milking cows.

37
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:17,991
But that's about to change.

38
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,551
You son of a bitch.

39
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:29,156
Some of the boys are saying,
if we ain't gonna fight,

40
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:35,231
we could settle all this
with a little high-stakes poker.

41
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:39,438
Wouldn't that be a sight? A bunch
of fellows sitting in this field,

42
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:42,232
drawing cards.

43
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:51,954
What is it?

44
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:54,231
Looks like a suicide.

45
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:55,714
Tucker!

46
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,837
What'd you say to him?

47
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,552
I didn't say nothing.

48
00:08:01,559 --> 00:08:03,356
Come on back, you son of a bitch!

49
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,747
Come on back!

50
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:08,799
- You won't make it a second time!
- All right by me.

51
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,233
Forgive me, Father.

52
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,277
- Ray!
- I got him.

53
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:20,708
No...

54
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,672
Don't take off my foot.

55
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:27,633
Rest easy. You'll keep your foot.

56
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:29,837
I swear you'll keep it.

57
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:37,957
- Bring up my ambulance.
- Sir?

58
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:41,031
Bring up my ambulance
and my surgeon with it!

59
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,232
We got an officer
who's worth something here.

60
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:14,312
The strangeness of life
cannot be measured,

61
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:18,631
In trying to produce my death,
I was elevated to a living hero,

62
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:23,276
I was awarded Cisco, the mount
I rode across the field that day,

63
00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:25,999
On recovery, I was given transfer

64
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:27,433
to any station I desired,

65
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:30,909
The slaughter continues in the east
as I arrive at Fort Hays,

66
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:35,357
an island of men and material
surrounded by prairie,

67
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:48,918
Lieutenant John J. Dunbar.

68
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:54,637
Lieutenant John J. Dunbar?

69
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:56,434
Yes, sir.

70
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,788
"Yes, sir".

71
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:00,033
Indian fighter, huh?

72
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,274
Excuse me?

73
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:06,355
You're posted to the frontier.
Frontier is Indian country.

74
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,794
I deduce you're an Indian fighter.

75
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,031
- I didn't get promoted being stupid.
- No, sir.

76
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:13,667
"No, sir".

77
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:19,234
It says here...

78
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,149
- you've been decorated.
- Yes, sir.

79
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:26,836
And they posted you here?

80
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:29,309
I'm here at my own request.

81
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:32,030
Really? Why?

82
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,630
I've wanted to see the frontier.

83
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:37,476
You want to see the frontier?

84
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:39,267
Yes, sir.

85
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:41,038
Before it's gone.

86
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:49,116
A smart lad coming to me.

87
00:13:56,199 --> 00:13:59,032
Sir Knight,

88
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:03,193
I am sending you
on a knight's errand.

89
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:06,635
Report to Captain Cargill

90
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:09,394
at the furthermost outpost
of the realm.

91
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:11,233
Fort Sedgewick.

92
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:15,590
My personal seal will assure

93
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:19,911
your safety through many miles
of wild and hostile country.

94
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:31,515
- I was wondering...
- Yes?

95
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:34,429
How will I be getting there?

96
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,632
You think I don't know?

97
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:39,917
- No, sir.
- You think I don't know.

98
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,070
- It's just I don't know.
- Hold your tongue.

99
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:46,027
I'm generous and will grant
your boon. See that peasant?

100
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,677
He calls himself Timmons.

101
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,349
He's going to Fort Sedgewick.
You can ride with him.

102
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:55,274
He knows the way.
That is all.

103
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,512
Sir Knight.

104
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:15,235
I just pissed in my pants.

105
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,713
And nobody can do
anything about it.

106
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,912
To your journey!

107
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:41,631
To my journey!

108
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,636
The king is dead.

109
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:22,195
Long live the king.

110
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:38,194
What you got?

111
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:53,397
Somebody back east is saying,
"Why don't he write?".

112
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:57,195
Stupid bastard.

113
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,792
What's that?

114
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,238
What is that?

115
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:38,351
What the hell is that?

116
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,637
Why don't you put that
in your book?

117
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,349
If not for my companion,
I'd be having

118
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:18,191
the time of my life,

119
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:20,913
He means well,

120
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:23,309
but he is possibly the foulest man
I have ever met,

121
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,792
Get up, Timmons.

122
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:03,554
Timmons.

123
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:05,754
Get up.

124
00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:19,873
Get up.

125
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:22,358
Come on, get up.

126
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:35,915
Did you poke me in my butt?

127
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,518
Goddamn it!

128
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:42,117
I'm gonna have a welt.

129
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:42,189
Why haven't we seen any buffalo?

130
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:45,277
You can't figure
the stinking buffalo.

131
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:48,312
Sometimes you won't see any
for days.

132
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:51,869
Other times, they'll be thick
as curls on a whore.

133
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:55,828
What about Indians?

134
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:58,633
Indians? Goddamn Indians.

135
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,597
You'd just as soon not see them
unless they're dead.

136
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:04,514
They're nothing but
thieves and beggars.

137
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:39,189
Not what you would call much
of a going concern, is it?

138
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:45,032
Go down there.

139
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,673
- Why? There's nothing down there.
- Because I said.

140
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:50,513
Go down there.

141
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,072
Son of a bitch!

142
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:24,515
There ain't nothing here.

143
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:46,110
There ain't nothing here,
Lieutenant.

144
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,108
Lieutenant!

145
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:56,069
Everybody's run off or got killed.

146
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:14,114
All right.

147
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:16,237
Let's unload the wagon.

148
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:18,792
And leave it all here?

149
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,108
I'm staying, too.

150
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:25,069
There ain't nothing here!

151
00:24:25,719 --> 00:24:28,074
No. Not at the moment.

152
00:24:28,479 --> 00:24:29,878
We don't know what happened.

153
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:34,637
Things being as they are,

154
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,950
we might as well turn around
and head back.

155
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:39,631
This is my post.

156
00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:42,074
- "This is my post"?
- This is my post.

157
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:47,116
"This is my post".
Jesus H. Christ.

158
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,918
Are you crazy, boy? Lieutenant?

159
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,878
That son of a bitch.

160
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:56,797
- Jesus H. Christ!
- This is my post.

161
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:58,472
Put it down.

162
00:24:58,639 --> 00:25:00,038
These are the post's provisions.

163
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:03,475
Get off the wagon
and help me unload.

164
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:05,870
We're just talking. Put it down.

165
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:57,351
I'll tell them where you are.

166
00:25:58,599 --> 00:25:59,714
Good.

167
00:26:02,239 --> 00:26:03,513
Good luck, Lieutenant.

168
00:26:05,639 --> 00:26:06,674
Thank you.

169
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,348
Have found Fort Sedgewick deserted,

170
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:13,229
Am waiting for garrison's return
or word from headquarters,

171
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:15,390
The post is in poor condition,

172
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:19,108
I have assigned myself clean-up duty
beginning tomorrow,

173
00:27:19,439 --> 00:27:23,637
Supplies are abundant, the country
is all I dreamed it would be,

174
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:26,633
There can be no place like this
on earth,

175
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:24,912
Bad horse.

176
00:28:25,439 --> 00:28:26,872
Bad horse.

177
00:30:01,959 --> 00:30:03,790
Come on, Cisco, one more time.

178
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:05,307
Get up, Cisco.

179
00:30:06,999 --> 00:30:08,034
Get up, Cisco.

180
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:15,398
Get up. There you go.

181
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:55,470
Only a white man would make a fire

182
00:30:55,999 --> 00:30:58,718
for everyone to see,

183
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,111
Maybe there's more than one,

184
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,308
There might be three or four,

185
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:08,277
I know three or four who will not
be making the trip back home,

186
00:31:08,959 --> 00:31:11,917
We have nothing to show for
this trail,

187
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,476
We have no rifles,
White men are sure to have rifles,

188
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:22,469
It's hard to say how many
might be down there,

189
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,359
We should forget this and go home,

190
00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:33,273
Then go,

191
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:35,793
I would rather die

192
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,709
than argue about a single line

193
00:31:38,879 --> 00:31:39,948
of smoke

194
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:41,827
in my country,

195
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,188
He will not quit

196
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:53,668
until we are all dead,

197
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:14,831
Oh, look at me.

198
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,352
Don't hurt my mules.

199
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:33,034
Stop. Stop it.

200
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:41,668
Please don't hurt my mules.

201
00:34:39,439 --> 00:34:41,999
Men had been living in these caves,
Why?

202
00:34:42,319 --> 00:34:45,038
Were they frightened?
Had there been some revolt?

203
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,069
I can make no sense
of the clues left here,

204
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,789
Perhaps my relief
will provide the answers,

205
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,750
It's been almost 30 days,

206
00:35:43,919 --> 00:35:45,193
Still no sign of Captain

207
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:46,634
Cargill's command,

208
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,032
Communications can take place

209
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:52,079
only if I leave, and I don't want
to abandon my post,

210
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:54,950
I've decided to ration my goods

211
00:35:55,439 --> 00:35:58,636
as if I were part of a post
rather than the whole affair,

212
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:02,959
There is a wolf who's intent
on the goings on here,

213
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,510
He's not inclined to be a nuisance,

214
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:09,356
And aside from Cisco,
he's been my only company,

215
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:11,749
He's come each afternoon
for two days,

216
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:15,110
He has milky white socks
on both feet,

217
00:36:15,759 --> 00:36:19,115
If he comes calling tomorrow,
I will name him Two Socks,

218
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:40,508
You there!

219
00:39:26,439 --> 00:39:28,748
Have made first contact
with an Indian,

220
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:30,990
One came and tried to steal
my horse,

221
00:39:31,919 --> 00:39:34,672
When I appeared, he became
frightened and ran off,

222
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:37,236
I don't know how many there are,

223
00:39:37,399 --> 00:39:39,959
but where there's one,
there's another,

224
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:42,235
I have decided

225
00:39:42,399 --> 00:39:45,550
to bury excess ordnance
lest it fall into enemy hands,

226
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:49,868
My rides have been reduced
to short patrols,

227
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:51,791
always in sight of the fort,

228
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:54,353
I am still alone, however,

229
00:39:54,999 --> 00:39:57,229
Unless troops arrives soon,
all may be lost,

230
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,991
It's been two days and nothing,

231
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:10,028
My presence must have been reported,

232
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:12,908
I have made all preparations
I can think of,

233
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,156
Cannot mount an adequate defense

234
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:18,028
but will try to make a big
impression when they come,

235
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:18,996
Waiting,

236
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:20,915
Postscript,

237
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:24,596
The man I encountered was
a magnificent-looking fellow,

238
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:31,470
I do not care for this talk
about a white man,

239
00:40:32,439 --> 00:40:33,713
Whatever he is,

240
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:37,270
he is not Sioux,
and that makes him less,

241
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:39,630
When I hear that more whites
are coming, I want to laugh,

242
00:40:39,799 --> 00:40:43,155
We took a hundred horses
from these people,

243
00:40:43,479 --> 00:40:44,912
There was no honor in it,

244
00:40:45,399 --> 00:40:48,755
They don't ride well, They don't
shoot well, They're dirty,

245
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:53,714
These soldiers could not even
make it through one winter here,

246
00:40:54,679 --> 00:40:58,638
These people are said to flourish?
I think they will all be dead soon,

247
00:41:01,399 --> 00:41:04,118
I think this fool is probably lost,

248
00:41:09,799 --> 00:41:12,916
Wind In His Hair's words
are strong and I have heard them,

249
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:16,119
It's true the whites are a poor race
and hard to understand,

250
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:18,308
But make no mistake,

251
00:41:18,479 --> 00:41:20,117
The whites are coming,

252
00:41:20,279 --> 00:41:21,871
Even our enemies agree on this,

253
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:25,669
So when I see one man alone
without fear in our country,

254
00:41:25,879 --> 00:41:27,153
I do not think he is lost,

255
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:29,871
I think he may have medicine,

256
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:33,399
I see someone who might speak for

257
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:35,949
all the white people
who are coming,

258
00:41:36,759 --> 00:41:39,956
I think this is a person with
which treaties might be struck,

259
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:43,796
I have heard,

260
00:41:45,399 --> 00:41:48,277
Kicking Bird is always
looking ahead,

261
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:49,667
and that is good,

262
00:41:49,879 --> 00:41:53,554
But this man cannot cover
our lodges or feed our children,

263
00:41:54,199 --> 00:41:56,269
He is nothing to us,

264
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:59,151
I will take some men,

265
00:41:59,479 --> 00:42:02,676
We will shoot some arrows into this
white man, If he truly has medicine,

266
00:42:02,999 --> 00:42:04,273
he will not be hurt,

267
00:42:05,239 --> 00:42:06,513
If he has no medicine,
he will be dead,

268
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:15,955
No man can tell another
what to do,

269
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:18,353
But killing a white man
is a delicate matter,

270
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:21,229
If you kill one,

271
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:22,833
more are sure to come,

272
00:42:28,759 --> 00:42:31,637
It's easy to become confused
by these questions,

273
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:35,309
It's hard to know what to do,

274
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:40,116
We should talk about this
some more,

275
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:43,311
That is all I have to say,

276
00:43:36,879 --> 00:43:38,358
We'll be heroes,

277
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:43,951
They'll write songs about us!

278
00:43:56,599 --> 00:43:57,236
What happened?

279
00:43:58,999 --> 00:43:59,795
What is it?

280
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:05,995
I don't know, my arm doesn't work,

281
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:10,833
You shouldn't have fallen off,

282
00:44:11,159 --> 00:44:12,751
Now we'll get in trouble,

283
00:44:13,399 --> 00:44:15,310
It was your idea,

284
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:17,072
My idea was

285
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:20,754
to take the horse,
not fall down,

286
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:27,151
Otter hurt himself,

287
00:44:29,919 --> 00:44:31,193
I'm the one who's hurt,

288
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:34,558
I will be when my father finds out,

289
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:36,311
His bow will be across my back,

290
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:17,868
Oh, God.

291
00:46:54,359 --> 00:46:55,633
I am Wind In His Hair,

292
00:46:58,359 --> 00:46:59,314
I am Wind

293
00:46:59,959 --> 00:47:00,755
In His Hair,

294
00:47:01,879 --> 00:47:02,675
Do you see

295
00:47:03,319 --> 00:47:04,911
that I am not afraid of you?

296
00:47:05,399 --> 00:47:06,514
Do you see?

297
00:48:02,199 --> 00:48:03,473
I realize I have been wrong,

298
00:48:04,439 --> 00:48:06,031
All this time I've been waiting,

299
00:48:06,519 --> 00:48:07,634
Waiting for what?

300
00:48:07,959 --> 00:48:10,314
For someone to find me?
For Indians to take

301
00:48:10,479 --> 00:48:12,754
my horse? To see a buffalo?

302
00:48:12,919 --> 00:48:15,479
Since my arrival,
I've been walking on eggs,

303
00:48:15,639 --> 00:48:16,913
It's a bad habit,

304
00:48:17,239 --> 00:48:20,117
I am sick of it,
Tomorrow I will ride out

305
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:24,114
to the Indians,
I do not know the wisdom of this,

306
00:48:24,279 --> 00:48:27,157
I've become a target,
A target makes a bad impression,

307
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:28,913
I am through waiting,

308
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:31,917
What are you looking at?

309
00:49:59,879 --> 00:50:00,834
Son of a bitch.

310
00:50:12,479 --> 00:50:13,434
Wait.

311
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:16,428
Wait.

312
00:50:18,999 --> 00:50:20,318
Wait.

313
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:25,949
You need help. You're hurt.
Let me help you.

314
00:50:28,439 --> 00:50:30,270
You need help.

315
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,631
You need help. You're hurt.

316
00:50:32,799 --> 00:50:34,027
Let me help you.

317
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:39,313
You're hurt.

318
00:50:39,719 --> 00:50:41,152
You're hurt.

319
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:45,634
Don't!

320
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:57,514
She's hurt.

321
00:54:04,399 --> 00:54:05,548
She's hurt.

322
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:17,787
You are not welcome here!

323
00:54:19,399 --> 00:54:20,912
Go away from us!

324
00:54:22,279 --> 00:54:24,076
No, she's hurt.

325
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:27,913
Go away from us!

326
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:29,194
Go away!

327
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:38,154
Go away!

328
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:40,315
You are not welcome here,

329
00:55:20,599 --> 00:55:22,396
Stop!

330
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,629
The soldier did not come to fight,

331
00:55:25,759 --> 00:55:26,874
He is going away,

332
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:28,794
and we will let him,

333
00:55:53,279 --> 00:55:56,157
I am in agreement with Kicking Bird,

334
00:55:57,079 --> 00:55:59,354
We will go down and talk
to the white man,

335
00:56:00,639 --> 00:56:02,072
And find out why

336
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,674
he is here,

337
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:12,631
I have heard Ten Bears,

338
00:56:13,279 --> 00:56:15,998
If this council decides to talk
to the white man,

339
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:17,433
then let it be so,

340
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:20,308
But in my mind it's not right
that a chief as great

341
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,232
as Ten Bears

342
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:27,354
goes to ask the business
of a puny, trespassing white man

343
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:29,157
with a smart horse and
a few white man's clothes,

344
00:56:30,879 --> 00:56:31,834
I will not go,

345
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:34,075
You will go,

346
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:41,911
And you will go,

347
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:45,431
That is all I have to say,

348
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:07,472
Welcome.

349
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:09,427
Welcome.

350
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:12,114
Hi.

351
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:20,513
Come.

352
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:22,831
Please sit down.

353
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:24,634
Sit down.

354
00:57:48,679 --> 00:57:50,909
Wait just a minute.

355
00:57:55,479 --> 00:57:57,276
His mind is gone,

356
00:58:24,319 --> 00:58:25,877
Tatanka, Buffalo.

357
00:58:27,159 --> 00:58:28,387
Buffalo.

358
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:29,868
Buffalo.

359
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:32,234
Buf...

360
00:58:35,479 --> 00:58:37,674
- Buf...
- Buffalo. Tatanka,

361
00:58:40,279 --> 00:58:44,636
The fierce one seems very tough,
I hope I never have to fight him,

362
00:58:45,239 --> 00:58:48,515
From what I know, he seems to be
honest and direct,

363
00:58:48,759 --> 00:58:50,875
I like the quiet one immensely,

364
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:54,873
He's patient and inquisitive,
He's eager to communicate,

365
00:58:55,039 --> 00:58:58,111
I conclude that he is a man
of weight among his people,

366
00:58:58,279 --> 00:58:59,598
Buffalo.

367
00:59:07,159 --> 00:59:10,435
I made a greater impression
on their next visit,

368
00:59:10,599 --> 00:59:13,193
I produced a coffee grinder,
which they'd never seen,

369
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:33,158
Is the coffee not good?

370
00:59:33,879 --> 00:59:36,552
It's too strong, maybe.
Too strong.

371
00:59:51,439 --> 00:59:52,588
Taste it.

372
01:00:03,439 --> 01:00:04,588
Sugar.

373
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:07,188
You want some?

374
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:08,748
You want some?

375
01:00:14,759 --> 01:00:15,908
That's a lot.

376
01:00:16,439 --> 01:00:19,954
It's good to have some company,
So much goes unsaid,

377
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:21,711
I feel these people,

378
01:00:21,879 --> 01:00:25,155
particularly the quiet one,
want something from me,

379
01:00:25,319 --> 01:00:27,787
Gave away coffee and
most of the sugar,

380
01:00:27,959 --> 01:00:29,278
It wouldn't last anyway,

381
01:00:29,439 --> 01:00:33,671
You could say a foundation for
good relations is being laid,

382
01:00:36,759 --> 01:00:38,238
Stands With A Fist,

383
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:44,431
We will talk awhile,

384
01:00:53,479 --> 01:00:55,913
Your wounds are healing well?

385
01:00:57,639 --> 01:00:59,277
Yes they are,

386
01:01:03,279 --> 01:01:05,713
Are you happy here,
with my family?

387
01:01:05,879 --> 01:01:07,392
I am glad to be here,

388
01:01:08,759 --> 01:01:12,832
I am missing my husband,

389
01:01:14,359 --> 01:01:17,715
Perhaps you will marry again
when the time is right,

390
01:01:17,879 --> 01:01:18,948
Perhaps,

391
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:29,028
We have word from many places
that the whites are coming,

392
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:32,275
They are coming into
everyone's country,

393
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:34,509
I think they will soon be in ours,

394
01:01:34,959 --> 01:01:37,314
This white man who lives
at the old soldier fort,,,

395
01:01:37,639 --> 01:01:40,472
I have visited him and believe
his heart

396
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:42,197
is a good one,

397
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:44,234
What do you say?

398
01:01:45,719 --> 01:01:46,708
What do you say?

399
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:48,949
I am afraid of the white man
at the fort,

400
01:01:50,119 --> 01:01:54,317
I am afraid he will tell others
that I am here,

401
01:01:54,759 --> 01:01:57,114
I am afraid they will try
to take me away,

402
01:01:57,279 --> 01:01:58,758
I've heard they take people away,

403
01:01:58,959 --> 01:02:01,314
Every warrior in camp
would fight them if they tried,

404
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:03,430
I cannot make the white man
language,

405
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:06,591
He cannot speak Sioux,

406
01:02:07,559 --> 01:02:10,471
It has been a long time
since I made this talk,

407
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:12,516
I want you to try,

408
01:02:13,399 --> 01:02:14,957
I don't know how,

409
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:16,188
Yes you do,

410
01:02:16,359 --> 01:02:18,589
- I can't,
- Yes you can,

411
01:02:19,399 --> 01:02:21,230
I can't, It's dead in me,

412
01:02:22,399 --> 01:02:26,597
I don't ask this for myself,
I ask this for all the people,

413
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:29,552
He knows things about the whites
which we do not,

414
01:02:29,919 --> 01:02:31,193
Now, you must remember,

415
01:02:35,399 --> 01:02:36,798
I can't,

416
01:02:47,559 --> 01:02:49,470
Will she make

417
01:02:49,639 --> 01:02:50,913
the white words?

418
01:02:52,279 --> 01:02:54,235
She's won't try,
She's being difficult,

419
01:02:55,159 --> 01:02:57,354
Well, she's the one who's crying,

420
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:00,909
Perhaps the difficulty is yours,

421
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:14,357
Christine!

422
01:03:19,559 --> 01:03:20,787
Christine!

423
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:25,797
Christine!

424
01:03:33,959 --> 01:03:35,597
Billy, get away from those puppies.

425
01:03:44,439 --> 01:03:46,589
Get the kids in the house.

426
01:03:48,279 --> 01:03:49,712
Go on, now.

427
01:03:50,679 --> 01:03:51,634
Christine!

428
01:03:53,519 --> 01:03:54,634
Christine! Where are you?

429
01:04:03,719 --> 01:04:04,913
Who is it, Willie?

430
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:06,678
They look like Pawnee.

431
01:04:06,999 --> 01:04:09,274
Our fathers are talking to them.

432
01:04:10,439 --> 01:04:12,669
- What do they want?
- I don't know.

433
01:04:13,639 --> 01:04:15,152
Go on. You heard us.

434
01:04:15,399 --> 01:04:16,548
Get out of here.

435
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:29,911
Run, Christine!

436
01:04:30,639 --> 01:04:32,277
I said run!

437
01:04:51,919 --> 01:04:53,238
Christine!

438
01:05:04,039 --> 01:05:06,872
Mommy! Mommy!

439
01:05:42,919 --> 01:05:45,592
Come on, Two Socks. Bacon.

440
01:05:45,759 --> 01:05:47,158
Two Socks, like Cisco,

441
01:05:47,319 --> 01:05:51,392
has become a trusted friend,
He won't eat from my hand,

442
01:05:51,559 --> 01:05:54,119
but his eyes and ears alert me
when something is wrong,

443
01:06:16,279 --> 01:06:17,473
Tatanka,

444
01:06:19,719 --> 01:06:22,916
No. I haven't seen any buffalo.

445
01:06:23,879 --> 01:06:24,914
Sorry.

446
01:06:44,119 --> 01:06:45,472
Are you hungry?

447
01:06:46,759 --> 01:06:47,953
Are you hungry?

448
01:06:48,639 --> 01:06:51,312
I have food.
I have a lot of food.

449
01:07:14,359 --> 01:07:17,351
Nothing I've been told
about the Indians is true,

450
01:07:17,519 --> 01:07:21,558
They are not beggars and thieves,
They are not bogeymen,

451
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:25,798
They are polite and have
a familiar humor I enjoy,

452
01:07:25,959 --> 01:07:28,075
Real communication is slow,

453
01:07:28,239 --> 01:07:30,799
and the quiet one is
as frustrated as I am,

454
01:07:30,959 --> 01:07:35,237
Most of our progress is built on
the basis of failure, not success,

455
01:07:35,959 --> 01:07:39,668
I thought to ask about the woman
I found on the prairie,

456
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:43,115
but it's far too complicated,
given our limitations,

457
01:07:43,279 --> 01:07:45,031
One thing is clear, however,

458
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:48,157
There are no buffalo,
and it weighs on their minds,

459
01:07:48,479 --> 01:07:50,788
Yesterday's visit was the best yet,

460
01:07:50,959 --> 01:07:54,918
I've been invited to the village,
I am looking forward to going,

461
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:20,587
We were waiting for you,

462
01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:34,632
We were waiting for you,

463
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:38,278
Now tell him we are glad
that he is here,

464
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:45,434
Hello.

465
01:09:46,919 --> 01:09:47,988
You...

466
01:09:48,519 --> 01:09:49,793
here...

467
01:09:52,039 --> 01:09:53,188
good.

468
01:09:56,719 --> 01:09:59,074
Thank you. I feel good.

469
01:10:04,879 --> 01:10:07,393
Ask him why he is at
the soldier fort,

470
01:10:12,119 --> 01:10:15,031
The soldier fort...

471
01:10:15,479 --> 01:10:17,117
Wait.

472
01:10:18,599 --> 01:10:19,668
What are your names?

473
01:10:21,399 --> 01:10:22,548
Our names?

474
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,868
What is his name?

475
01:10:30,999 --> 01:10:33,752
He's right,
Introductions should come first,

476
01:10:39,479 --> 01:10:40,707
He...

477
01:10:41,359 --> 01:10:42,314
Kick...

478
01:10:43,079 --> 01:10:44,148
Kick.

479
01:10:44,799 --> 01:10:46,232
Kick, more.

480
01:10:46,559 --> 01:10:47,753
More kick?

481
01:10:48,079 --> 01:10:49,717
- More kicking?
- Kicking.

482
01:10:49,879 --> 01:10:50,914
Kicking...

483
01:10:52,559 --> 01:10:53,594
Bird.

484
01:10:54,079 --> 01:10:55,432
Kicking Bird.

485
01:10:55,599 --> 01:10:56,873
Kicking Bird.

486
01:11:02,039 --> 01:11:03,472
What is he?

487
01:11:04,879 --> 01:11:06,073
Is he Chief?

488
01:11:19,719 --> 01:11:22,313
A holy man.

489
01:11:22,519 --> 01:11:24,749
Holy man.

490
01:11:28,959 --> 01:11:30,028
Your name?

491
01:11:31,799 --> 01:11:34,597
- I don't know.
- What's your name?

492
01:12:04,519 --> 01:12:05,918
Get up?

493
01:12:10,439 --> 01:12:11,508
Stand up?

494
01:12:12,919 --> 01:12:14,716
Stands. Stands.

495
01:12:15,079 --> 01:12:17,718
Stands. Your name is Stands?

496
01:12:17,879 --> 01:12:19,073
Stands...

497
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:23,194
wiff...

498
01:12:23,599 --> 01:12:24,793
- With.
- With.

499
01:12:24,959 --> 01:12:26,836
- Stands With...
- With.

500
01:12:30,159 --> 01:12:31,194
Fist?

501
01:12:31,959 --> 01:12:32,994
Yes.

502
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:34,837
Stands With A Fist?

503
01:12:38,199 --> 01:12:41,111
Stands With A Fist.
I am John

504
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:42,314
Dunbar.

505
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:45,153
John Dunbar.

506
01:12:51,119 --> 01:12:52,632
Dunbear.

507
01:12:53,279 --> 01:12:55,190
No, not Dunbear.

508
01:12:55,759 --> 01:12:57,033
Dunbar.

509
01:13:00,479 --> 01:13:01,673
Not Dunbear.

510
01:13:33,599 --> 01:13:36,193
An exciting breakthrough
with the Indians,

511
01:13:36,359 --> 01:13:40,477
A woman among them speaks English,
Clear progress was made,

512
01:13:40,679 --> 01:13:43,398
I'm reluctant to answer
their questions,

513
01:13:43,799 --> 01:13:47,428
My sense of duty or something
tells me not to say too much,

514
01:13:48,119 --> 01:13:50,474
It was good to see
Fort Sedgewick again,

515
01:13:50,679 --> 01:13:54,877
I look forward to visiting my
neighbors, but this is still home,

516
01:13:55,079 --> 01:13:56,637
I watch for my relief

517
01:13:56,799 --> 01:13:59,438
and hope my negotiations
will bear fruit,

518
01:16:01,239 --> 01:16:04,197
Buffalo! Buffalo!

519
01:16:04,399 --> 01:16:05,434
I've seen buffalo!

520
01:16:34,519 --> 01:16:37,033
Buffalo!

521
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:39,997
Tatanka!

522
01:17:22,839 --> 01:17:23,954
Riders were sent out

523
01:17:24,119 --> 01:17:25,632
to pick up the trail,

524
01:17:25,839 --> 01:17:30,355
By the time I'd got my things,
the entire tribe was on its way,

525
01:17:31,159 --> 01:17:35,072
The efficiency and speed
of the people would impress

526
01:17:35,239 --> 01:17:36,718
any military commander,

527
01:17:37,279 --> 01:17:40,715
Overnight, I have gone from
a person of suspicion

528
01:17:40,879 --> 01:17:42,676
to one of genuine standing,

529
01:17:42,919 --> 01:17:46,229
I am greeted with open smiles
and looks of appreciation,

530
01:17:46,519 --> 01:17:48,430
In short,
I have become a celebrity,

531
01:17:48,599 --> 01:17:50,157
Loo-ten-tant.

532
01:17:53,599 --> 01:17:56,796
Scouts picked up the trail
where I said it would be,

533
01:17:57,519 --> 01:17:59,316
It was not hard to find,

534
01:17:59,559 --> 01:18:03,074
A giant swath of torn-up ground
extending to the horizon,

535
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:08,034
The numbers it took to create this
impossible image was unimaginable,

536
01:18:26,999 --> 01:18:28,478
Loo-ten-tant.

537
01:20:49,479 --> 01:20:52,516
Who would do this?
The field was proof

538
01:20:52,679 --> 01:20:55,910
that it was a people
without value or soul,

539
01:20:56,079 --> 01:20:58,354
with no regard for Sioux rites,

540
01:20:58,759 --> 01:21:01,432
The wagon tracks left little doubt,

541
01:21:01,599 --> 01:21:03,715
My heart sank as I knew

542
01:21:03,879 --> 01:21:05,198
it was white hunters,

543
01:21:05,799 --> 01:21:09,474
Voices that had been joyous
were silent as the dead buffalo

544
01:21:09,639 --> 01:21:11,357
were left to rot,

545
01:21:11,519 --> 01:21:14,670
killed only for their tongues
and the price of their hides,

546
01:21:22,839 --> 01:21:25,672
As they celebrated the coming hunt,

547
01:21:25,959 --> 01:21:27,995
it was hard to know where to be,

548
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:32,154
I don't know if they understood,
but I couldn't sleep among them,

549
01:21:32,439 --> 01:21:35,511
There had been no looks
and no blame,

550
01:21:35,799 --> 01:21:39,394
Only the confusion of people
not able to predict the future,

551
01:28:57,079 --> 01:28:59,354
Are you all right?

552
01:30:44,279 --> 01:30:45,678
I can't.

553
01:30:46,759 --> 01:30:49,148
No, I'm full.

554
01:30:49,319 --> 01:30:52,516
I'm full. And I can't tell
the story any more.

555
01:31:01,879 --> 01:31:03,392
You want to try it?

556
01:31:04,359 --> 01:31:05,633
You want to try it?

557
01:31:09,519 --> 01:31:10,634
Here.

558
01:31:39,079 --> 01:31:40,194
I can't.

559
01:31:40,359 --> 01:31:41,553
This is too much.

560
01:31:47,679 --> 01:31:48,748
Good trade.

561
01:31:52,119 --> 01:31:54,269
This is a good trade.

562
01:31:59,199 --> 01:32:02,350
No, I can't. I'm full.
I'm tired.

563
01:32:22,519 --> 01:32:23,554
Tatanka,

564
01:32:23,719 --> 01:32:25,994
Big tatanka,

565
01:32:26,199 --> 01:32:27,473
Big tatanka,

566
01:32:54,799 --> 01:32:55,993
That's my hat.

567
01:33:05,959 --> 01:33:07,631
You're wearing my hat.

568
01:33:11,479 --> 01:33:12,628
It's my hat.

569
01:33:13,159 --> 01:33:15,548
I found it on the prairie,
It's mine,

570
01:33:20,679 --> 01:33:21,794
My hat.

571
01:33:40,159 --> 01:33:44,152
That hat belongs to the Lieutenant,

572
01:33:44,319 --> 01:33:46,469
He left it on the prairie,

573
01:33:46,799 --> 01:33:48,152
He didn't want it,

574
01:33:50,199 --> 01:33:52,190
Well, you can see

575
01:33:52,519 --> 01:33:53,474
he wants it now,

576
01:33:54,639 --> 01:33:58,518
We all know that
it's a soldier's hat,

577
01:33:59,879 --> 01:34:00,948
We all know

578
01:34:01,119 --> 01:34:02,677
who wears it,

579
01:34:03,639 --> 01:34:05,834
If you want to keep it,
that's all right,

580
01:34:05,999 --> 01:34:07,273
But give something for it,

581
01:34:41,919 --> 01:34:44,069
Good trade.

582
01:36:49,999 --> 01:36:52,797
It seems every day ends
with a miracle here,

583
01:36:53,319 --> 01:36:56,550
Whatever God may be,
I thank God for this day,

584
01:36:57,079 --> 01:36:59,388
To stay longer
would've been useless,

585
01:36:59,639 --> 01:37:02,107
We had all the meat
we could possibly carry,

586
01:37:02,519 --> 01:37:05,431
We had hunted for 3 days,
losing 6 ponies,

587
01:37:05,599 --> 01:37:07,317
And only 3 men injured,

588
01:37:08,039 --> 01:37:11,668
I'd never known people
so eager to laugh,

589
01:37:11,839 --> 01:37:12,749
so devoted to family,

590
01:37:12,919 --> 01:37:16,753
so dedicated to each other, The word
that came to mind was "harmony",

591
01:37:25,719 --> 01:37:28,870
Many times I've felt lonely,
But until this afternoon,

592
01:37:29,039 --> 01:37:32,349
I'd never felt completely lonely,

593
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:44,309
Though only 2 days,
it seems like a week,

594
01:38:44,479 --> 01:38:46,788
I am missing the company
of my new friends,

595
01:38:47,319 --> 01:38:50,072
I can see all their faces,
but it is not enough,

596
01:38:50,359 --> 01:38:52,589
Tomorrow I will make a visit,

597
01:38:52,759 --> 01:38:55,068
They are my neighbors,
What can it hurt?

598
01:39:10,799 --> 01:39:12,596
Go home!

599
01:39:17,999 --> 01:39:19,068
Go!

600
01:39:19,279 --> 01:39:20,871
Go home, Two Socks.

601
01:39:22,319 --> 01:39:24,196
Bad wolf. Bad wolf.

602
01:40:01,959 --> 01:40:05,713
It is autumn, and I am spending
more time with my friends,

603
01:40:05,919 --> 01:40:09,150
They have given me my own lodge
and I feel comfortable,

604
01:40:09,479 --> 01:40:10,798
We talk every day,

605
01:40:10,959 --> 01:40:13,314
but Kicking Bird
is frustrated with me,

606
01:40:13,479 --> 01:40:16,915
He wants to know how many more
white people are coming,

607
01:40:17,119 --> 01:40:20,509
I tell him white people
will only pass through

608
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:23,836
this country,
But I am speaking in half-truths,

609
01:40:23,999 --> 01:40:27,196
One day there will be too many,
But I cannot tell him that,

610
01:40:28,479 --> 01:40:31,710
I am sure Stands with a Fist
knows I am holding back,

611
01:40:32,279 --> 01:40:34,190
But she says nothing,

612
01:41:01,919 --> 01:41:05,707
A war party is going against
the Pawnee, I have asked to go,

613
01:41:05,879 --> 01:41:08,188
I sensed that I made a mistake
in doing so,

614
01:41:08,359 --> 01:41:10,748
But I didn't take it back,

615
01:41:10,999 --> 01:41:15,515
They are my friends, and the Pawnee
have been very hard on them,

616
01:41:15,919 --> 01:41:18,433
I hope I have not overstepped
my bounds,

617
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:24,277
Come in, please.

618
01:41:26,679 --> 01:41:27,794
Sit down.

619
01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:33,429
Kicking Bird wants to know

620
01:41:33,599 --> 01:41:37,035
why you want to make war
on the Pawnee.

621
01:41:37,359 --> 01:41:39,998
They have done nothing to you.

622
01:41:40,679 --> 01:41:42,112
They are Sioux enemies.

623
01:41:51,399 --> 01:41:53,117
Only Sioux warriors to go.

624
01:41:53,519 --> 01:41:56,238
Tell him I have been a warrior
longer than many

625
01:41:56,399 --> 01:41:59,516
of the young men who will go
on the war party.

626
01:42:14,079 --> 01:42:18,311
He says the Sioux way
of being a warrior

627
01:42:18,479 --> 01:42:21,516
is not the white way.
You are not ready.

628
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:25,115
I know. But tell him
I cannot learn these ways in camp.

629
01:42:32,999 --> 01:42:35,559
He also asks that you

630
01:42:36,399 --> 01:42:37,957
watch over his family

631
01:42:38,119 --> 01:42:39,711
while he is gone.

632
01:42:41,159 --> 01:42:43,229
This thing he asks is
a great honor

633
01:42:43,399 --> 01:42:44,752
for you.

634
01:42:47,359 --> 01:42:50,590
I would be happy
to watch over his family.

635
01:42:57,319 --> 01:42:59,469
He thanks Dances With Wolves
for coming.

636
01:43:01,439 --> 01:43:03,031
Who is Dances With Wolves?

637
01:43:05,279 --> 01:43:07,793
It is the name which

638
01:43:07,959 --> 01:43:10,109
the people are calling you now.

639
01:43:10,959 --> 01:43:13,427
Dances With Wolves.

640
01:43:13,719 --> 01:43:15,038
That's right.

641
01:43:15,479 --> 01:43:16,673
That day.

642
01:43:17,919 --> 01:43:19,716
Dances With Wolves.

643
01:43:21,039 --> 01:43:22,267
How do you say it?

644
01:43:57,639 --> 01:44:00,631
Keep on with the white man talk,

645
01:44:00,839 --> 01:44:02,750
if it pleases you,

646
01:44:02,919 --> 01:44:05,308
I like to make the talk,

647
01:44:42,799 --> 01:44:46,269
Oh, I cut this off today.
I shaved it off.

648
01:44:46,599 --> 01:44:47,748
Go on.

649
01:44:49,359 --> 01:44:51,190
Grass grows on the prairie.

650
01:44:54,959 --> 01:44:56,312
Wrong.

651
01:44:56,479 --> 01:44:59,039
You said,
"Fire lives on the prairie".

652
01:44:59,199 --> 01:44:59,631
I did?

653
01:45:00,759 --> 01:45:02,909
No laughing now.

654
01:45:14,799 --> 01:45:16,312
How did you get your name?

655
01:45:20,999 --> 01:45:23,797
I was not very old...

656
01:45:24,559 --> 01:45:26,993
when I came to be with our people.

657
01:45:27,839 --> 01:45:29,909
And I was made to work.

658
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:33,028
I worked every day very hard.

659
01:45:34,639 --> 01:45:37,756
And there was one woman

660
01:45:37,919 --> 01:45:39,989
who didn't like me much.

661
01:45:41,399 --> 01:45:45,187
She used to call me bad names
and sometimes she...

662
01:45:49,519 --> 01:45:50,838
beat me.

663
01:45:54,479 --> 01:45:59,269
One day, she was calling me
these bad names...

664
01:45:59,439 --> 01:46:01,669
with her face in my face.

665
01:46:02,719 --> 01:46:04,072
And I hit her.

666
01:46:05,839 --> 01:46:08,876
I was not very big,
but she fell down.

667
01:46:09,119 --> 01:46:11,587
She fell hard and didn't move.

668
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:17,030
And I stood over her with my fist
and asked

669
01:46:17,759 --> 01:46:20,227
if there was any other woman

670
01:46:20,559 --> 01:46:23,198
who wanted to call me bad names.

671
01:46:24,519 --> 01:46:27,192
No one bothered me after that day.

672
01:46:29,799 --> 01:46:32,313
No, I wouldn't think so.

673
01:46:37,479 --> 01:46:38,594
Show me.

674
01:46:39,799 --> 01:46:41,790
Show me where you hit her.

675
01:47:09,359 --> 01:47:11,031
Why are you not married?

676
01:47:14,879 --> 01:47:16,870
- I'm sorry.
- I have to go.

677
01:47:18,999 --> 01:47:20,193
I'm sorry.

678
01:47:22,599 --> 01:47:23,998
- Can I help you?
- No.

679
01:47:43,159 --> 01:47:45,229
Some of your words are wrong,

680
01:47:46,039 --> 01:47:49,076
but you are learning fast,

681
01:47:49,879 --> 01:47:50,834
So,,,

682
01:47:51,479 --> 01:47:54,039
what can I tell you today?

683
01:47:55,319 --> 01:47:57,230
I want to know about
Stands With A Fist,

684
01:47:57,399 --> 01:47:59,629
Why is there no man with her?

685
01:48:02,039 --> 01:48:04,599
She is in mourning,

686
01:48:09,399 --> 01:48:12,436
I do not understand "mourning",

687
01:48:14,199 --> 01:48:16,429
She cries for someone,

688
01:48:18,839 --> 01:48:20,591
Cries for who?

689
01:48:24,599 --> 01:48:26,669
It is not polite
to speak of the dead,

690
01:48:27,319 --> 01:48:28,593
But you are new,

691
01:48:29,239 --> 01:48:30,991
so I will tell you,

692
01:48:31,799 --> 01:48:33,710
She cries for her husband,

693
01:48:33,879 --> 01:48:35,312
He was killed not long ago,

694
01:48:35,639 --> 01:48:38,199
That is how you came to find her
on the prairie

695
01:48:38,839 --> 01:48:39,954
crying,

696
01:48:43,319 --> 01:48:46,834
How long will she cry?

697
01:48:49,079 --> 01:48:50,990
It is Kicking Bird's place to say

698
01:48:52,119 --> 01:48:53,393
when she is finished,

699
01:48:53,879 --> 01:48:56,439
He's the one that found her
when she was very little,

700
01:49:14,359 --> 01:49:16,589
People are talking about you,

701
01:49:19,799 --> 01:49:20,754
What are they saying?

702
01:49:21,719 --> 01:49:23,471
They are proud of

703
01:49:24,279 --> 01:49:26,190
the medicine you are making

704
01:49:26,359 --> 01:49:29,078
with Dances With Wolves,

705
01:49:32,439 --> 01:49:34,350
I have hurt him,

706
01:49:34,519 --> 01:49:36,271
and I should go talk to him,

707
01:49:37,719 --> 01:49:39,630
You can't, He is gone,

708
01:49:41,239 --> 01:49:42,831
He left this morning,

709
01:51:52,319 --> 01:51:53,991
I bet you were thinking,

710
01:51:54,279 --> 01:51:55,871
"Now, why don't he write".

711
01:51:57,159 --> 01:51:58,672
Hello, Two Socks.

712
01:52:24,999 --> 01:52:26,193
Come on.

713
01:52:27,519 --> 01:52:28,554
Come on.

714
01:52:30,799 --> 01:52:33,757
Come on, you can do this.

715
01:52:34,239 --> 01:52:35,433
You can do this.

716
01:52:40,199 --> 01:52:41,314
Come on.

717
01:52:52,799 --> 01:52:54,437
It's easy.

718
01:52:54,639 --> 01:52:56,869
This is easy, Two Socks.

719
01:53:52,759 --> 01:53:54,511
I am in mourning.

720
01:54:03,079 --> 01:54:04,910
No one can know.

721
01:54:06,119 --> 01:54:08,189
We must be careful.

722
01:54:09,799 --> 01:54:11,437
We must be careful.

723
01:57:00,799 --> 01:57:01,914
What?

724
01:57:02,799 --> 01:57:04,198
I don't know.

725
01:57:26,759 --> 01:57:28,989
The Pawnee are coming.
40 or 50 men.

726
01:57:29,159 --> 01:57:31,798
Hunters found them to the north.

727
01:57:31,959 --> 01:57:33,995
- They're heading for our camp.
- Stone Calf, wait,

728
01:57:34,159 --> 01:57:36,275
I will follow you,

729
01:57:36,439 --> 01:57:38,999
The Pawnee do not come for horses,
They come for blood,

730
01:57:39,279 --> 01:57:41,509
Get your weapons
and come to my lodge,

731
01:57:41,679 --> 01:57:42,668
I will go.

732
01:57:43,119 --> 01:57:44,347
I will get them,

733
01:57:44,919 --> 01:57:46,068
Stone Calf, wait,

734
01:57:46,559 --> 01:57:48,231
I have guns,

735
01:57:48,399 --> 01:57:49,798
I have many rifles,

736
01:57:52,319 --> 01:57:54,196
- At the fort?
- Yes.

737
01:57:55,319 --> 01:57:57,469
No, The ride is long
and we can spare no men,

738
01:57:57,799 --> 01:58:00,029
Guns would make one warrior

739
01:58:00,279 --> 01:58:01,473
like two,

740
01:58:06,119 --> 01:58:08,030
Take one man and go quickly,

741
01:58:10,279 --> 01:58:11,553
I will take Smiles A Lot,

742
01:58:12,999 --> 01:58:13,636
Very well,

743
02:01:29,799 --> 02:01:30,595
Shoot the gun!

744
02:05:19,279 --> 02:05:21,474
It was hard to know how to feel,

745
02:05:21,799 --> 02:05:23,710
I had never been
in a battle like this,

746
02:05:24,359 --> 02:05:26,429
There was no
dark political objective,

747
02:05:26,919 --> 02:05:30,594
It was not a fight for territory
or riches or to make men free,

748
02:05:31,079 --> 02:05:34,116
It was fought to preserve
our winter food stores,

749
02:05:34,439 --> 02:05:37,954
to protect the lives
of women and children right here,

750
02:05:39,079 --> 02:05:40,990
Stone Calf was a great loss,

751
02:05:41,639 --> 02:05:43,869
But no one could remember
such a great victory,

752
02:05:44,839 --> 02:05:46,750
I began to look at it
in a new way,

753
02:05:47,879 --> 02:05:49,790
I felt a pride
I had never felt before,

754
02:05:50,919 --> 02:05:53,308
I'd never really known
who John Dunbar was,

755
02:05:54,119 --> 02:05:56,189
Perhaps the name had no meaning,

756
02:05:56,679 --> 02:05:59,239
But as I heard my Sioux name
being called

757
02:05:59,399 --> 02:06:01,788
I knew for the first time
who I really was,

758
02:07:34,239 --> 02:07:37,470
Where are you going?
There is gambling tonight,

759
02:07:37,639 --> 02:07:39,869
Horseback's games are always good,

760
02:07:40,039 --> 02:07:41,313
I'm tired,

761
02:07:41,959 --> 02:07:43,870
Horseback already has

762
02:07:44,039 --> 02:07:46,428
a good rifle of mine,

763
02:07:49,639 --> 02:07:51,709
Good night,

764
02:08:32,759 --> 02:08:35,319
How long will
Stands With A Fist mourn?

765
02:08:36,599 --> 02:08:38,510
I don't know,

766
02:08:42,199 --> 02:08:44,429
I hope it will not be long,

767
02:08:47,159 --> 02:08:49,070
Has something happened?

768
02:08:50,199 --> 02:08:50,995
What?

769
02:08:52,439 --> 02:08:54,350
She has found love again,

770
02:08:56,119 --> 02:08:56,756
With who?

771
02:08:58,039 --> 02:08:59,154
Who do you think?

772
02:08:59,639 --> 02:09:00,435
Tell me,

773
02:09:01,079 --> 02:09:02,671
Dances With Wolves,

774
02:09:06,039 --> 02:09:07,313
Are you certain of this?

775
02:09:08,759 --> 02:09:11,796
When you see them together,
you will know,

776
02:09:14,039 --> 02:09:15,313
What are people saying?

777
02:09:16,439 --> 02:09:18,031
They like the match,

778
02:09:23,479 --> 02:09:24,753
No one is angry?

779
02:09:25,559 --> 02:09:28,596
It makes sense,
They are both white,

780
02:09:31,319 --> 02:09:34,675
I suppose I will be the one
to say something,

781
02:09:36,439 --> 02:09:38,191
She's your daughter now,

782
02:09:39,319 --> 02:09:40,434
I know,

783
02:09:46,519 --> 02:09:49,716
Relax, you can't see
everything coming,

784
02:09:50,999 --> 02:09:51,636
Stop it,

785
02:09:52,279 --> 02:09:53,394
Quit your playing,

786
02:10:07,159 --> 02:10:08,433
Stands With A Fist,

787
02:10:10,039 --> 02:10:11,313
You will mourn no more,

788
02:10:27,319 --> 02:10:28,434
You look good,

789
02:10:29,559 --> 02:10:31,948
You know, the man she mourned for,,,

790
02:10:32,599 --> 02:10:34,510
He was my best friend,

791
02:10:37,079 --> 02:10:38,353
I didn't know that,

792
02:10:41,239 --> 02:10:42,831
He was a good man,

793
02:10:44,119 --> 02:10:46,349
It has been hard for me
to like you,

794
02:10:48,439 --> 02:10:50,669
I am not the thinker
Kicking Bird is,

795
02:10:51,799 --> 02:10:53,710
I always feel anger first,

796
02:10:54,359 --> 02:10:56,270
There were no answers
to my questions,

797
02:10:56,759 --> 02:10:57,874
But now I think

798
02:10:58,359 --> 02:10:59,951
he went away because

799
02:11:00,439 --> 02:11:01,394
you were coming,

800
02:11:01,719 --> 02:11:02,993
That is how I see it,

801
02:11:27,239 --> 02:11:29,389
This is a good day for me,

802
02:11:31,159 --> 02:11:32,114
And for me.

803
02:11:34,759 --> 02:11:38,195
Stands With A Fist,
if you want this man,

804
02:11:38,679 --> 02:11:40,271
take his hand in yours,

805
02:11:53,399 --> 02:11:55,469
I'd never been married,

806
02:11:55,799 --> 02:11:57,391
I don't know if all grooms

807
02:11:57,879 --> 02:11:59,153
feel the same,

808
02:11:59,479 --> 02:12:02,516
but as Kicking Bird described
what was expected

809
02:12:02,999 --> 02:12:06,036
of a Sioux husband, my mind shut out
everything but her,

810
02:12:06,519 --> 02:12:08,271
The tiny details of her costume,

811
02:12:08,919 --> 02:12:10,193
The contours of her shape,

812
02:12:11,159 --> 02:12:12,433
The light in her eyes,

813
02:12:13,079 --> 02:12:14,512
The smallness of her feet,

814
02:12:15,799 --> 02:12:18,029
I knew the love between us
would be served,

815
02:12:19,799 --> 02:12:22,029
Have you heard what I have said?

816
02:12:24,279 --> 02:12:26,998
Have you heard what I have said?

817
02:12:31,319 --> 02:12:32,911
Good, then

818
02:12:33,879 --> 02:12:35,153
take her inside,

819
02:12:36,119 --> 02:12:37,234
She is your wife,

820
02:12:39,959 --> 02:12:40,755
Oh, good.

821
02:12:42,999 --> 02:12:44,591
Thank you,

822
02:13:32,759 --> 02:13:34,989
It's good to be out,

823
02:13:36,279 --> 02:13:37,871
Yes, it must be,

824
02:13:39,479 --> 02:13:41,549
We are trying for a baby,

825
02:13:43,319 --> 02:13:44,274
No waiting?

826
02:13:45,239 --> 02:13:46,513
No waiting,

827
02:13:50,839 --> 02:13:53,228
I was just thinking that
of all the trails

828
02:13:53,719 --> 02:13:55,471
in this life,

829
02:13:56,119 --> 02:13:58,030
there is one that matters most,

830
02:13:59,319 --> 02:14:02,197
It is the trail of a true
human being,

831
02:14:03,639 --> 02:14:04,913
I think you are on this trail,

832
02:14:06,999 --> 02:14:08,273
and it is good to see,

833
02:14:26,999 --> 02:14:28,432
You ride your horse often,

834
02:14:33,239 --> 02:14:33,876
I like that,

835
02:14:48,119 --> 02:14:50,189
You always ask about
the white people,

836
02:14:53,399 --> 02:14:55,310
You always want to know
how many more are coming,

837
02:14:57,719 --> 02:14:59,152
There will be a lot, my friend,

838
02:15:00,279 --> 02:15:01,871
More than can be counted,

839
02:15:04,599 --> 02:15:05,395
How many?

840
02:15:08,439 --> 02:15:09,872
Like the stars.

841
02:15:15,479 --> 02:15:16,753
Like the stars,

842
02:15:23,319 --> 02:15:25,549
It makes me afraid

843
02:15:26,039 --> 02:15:27,313
for all the Sioux,

844
02:15:34,519 --> 02:15:36,908
We should tell this to Ten Bears,

845
02:16:02,359 --> 02:16:04,748
The men who wore this came
in the time of

846
02:16:05,239 --> 02:16:07,150
my Grandfather's Grandfather,

847
02:16:07,799 --> 02:16:08,754
Eventually,

848
02:16:09,239 --> 02:16:10,194
we drove them out,

849
02:16:11,159 --> 02:16:13,719
Then the Mexicans came,
They do not come here any more,

850
02:16:15,319 --> 02:16:16,911
In my own time, the Texans,

851
02:16:18,199 --> 02:16:20,269
They have been like all the others,

852
02:16:23,479 --> 02:16:25,868
They take

853
02:16:26,039 --> 02:16:27,791
without asking,

854
02:16:28,919 --> 02:16:32,434
I don't know if we are ready
for these people,

855
02:16:33,879 --> 02:16:35,153
But I think you are right,

856
02:16:36,119 --> 02:16:38,030
I think they will keep coming,

857
02:16:39,319 --> 02:16:41,230
When I think of that,
I look at this helmet,

858
02:16:44,119 --> 02:16:45,393
Our country is all that we have,

859
02:16:46,039 --> 02:16:47,950
and we will fight to keep it,

860
02:16:49,399 --> 02:16:52,277
Tomorrow we will strike the village
and go to the winter camp,

861
02:17:08,439 --> 02:17:10,999
You have everything
from the soldier fort?

862
02:17:12,599 --> 02:17:14,032
Yes. There's nothing for me there.

863
02:17:15,799 --> 02:17:16,754
That's good.

864
02:17:30,199 --> 02:17:30,995
The journal.

865
02:17:33,559 --> 02:17:34,833
Wait.

866
02:17:35,959 --> 02:17:39,156
The book is like a trail
for people to follow.

867
02:17:39,639 --> 02:17:42,995
It tells everything about
my life here. I must get it.

868
02:17:43,159 --> 02:17:43,796
Enough.

869
02:17:44,119 --> 02:17:46,030
We cannot wait for you.

870
02:17:57,839 --> 02:17:58,988
I'll catch up.

871
02:17:59,279 --> 02:18:00,632
I'll catch up.

872
02:18:38,759 --> 02:18:39,748
Injuns!

873
02:19:10,319 --> 02:19:12,389
Stay down. Stay.

874
02:19:15,039 --> 02:19:16,028
Oh, God.

875
02:19:21,559 --> 02:19:22,628
It's okay.

876
02:20:02,799 --> 02:20:06,314
Something must have happened,
Dances With Wolves is not coming,

877
02:20:07,439 --> 02:20:08,633
He must have trouble,

878
02:20:10,799 --> 02:20:13,188
Algo ha pasado,
no es normal,

879
02:20:13,679 --> 02:20:16,398
Pick two good men and send them
back to the soldier fort,

880
02:20:27,279 --> 02:20:28,075
Spivey.

881
02:20:29,679 --> 02:20:31,590
- Spivey.
- Yeah, Sergeant?

882
02:20:32,719 --> 02:20:34,630
Tell the major he's waking up.

883
02:20:36,719 --> 02:20:37,834
Move your worthless ass.

884
02:20:49,519 --> 02:20:51,430
You got yourself
a hell of a shiner,

885
02:20:51,919 --> 02:20:52,715
didn't you?

886
02:21:05,199 --> 02:21:06,314
Does he speak English?

887
02:21:07,119 --> 02:21:08,074
I don't know, sir.

888
02:21:10,319 --> 02:21:11,274
You speak English?

889
02:21:13,839 --> 02:21:14,794
You talk English?

890
02:21:15,599 --> 02:21:16,395
Talk!

891
02:21:17,999 --> 02:21:19,273
I speak English.

892
02:21:23,919 --> 02:21:24,874
Who are you?

893
02:21:27,279 --> 02:21:30,510
Lieutenant John J. Dunbar.
This is my post.

894
02:21:32,079 --> 02:21:33,353
Why are you dressed like that?

895
02:21:35,759 --> 02:21:38,478
I came out from Fort Hays
last April, but nobody was here.

896
02:21:40,079 --> 02:21:41,034
You have proof of that?

897
02:21:44,399 --> 02:21:46,310
My journal's in my quarters.

898
02:21:46,719 --> 02:21:49,916
My orders are in the journal.
It'll tell you everything.

899
02:21:50,879 --> 02:21:53,268
Spivey, you and Edwards
were the first here.

900
02:21:53,759 --> 02:21:55,829
Did you find a journal?

901
02:21:56,799 --> 02:21:57,914
We didn't find nothing, sir.

902
02:21:58,879 --> 02:21:59,994
Where's Edwards?

903
02:22:01,119 --> 02:22:01,915
He's outside.

904
02:22:06,719 --> 02:22:08,152
He didn't find nothing either.

905
02:22:23,879 --> 02:22:25,437
You turned Injun, didn't you?

906
02:22:26,879 --> 02:22:27,516
Didn't you?

907
02:22:31,519 --> 02:22:34,079
- He's a soldier.
- He's an officer.

908
02:22:34,399 --> 02:22:36,310
Officer? Do you salute him
or shoot him?

909
02:22:45,439 --> 02:22:47,031
Here, you, eyes front.

910
02:22:52,639 --> 02:22:53,913
Eyes front!

911
02:23:48,479 --> 02:23:49,753
Why are you out of uniform?

912
02:23:54,239 --> 02:23:55,831
Why's the army out here?

913
02:23:56,639 --> 02:23:57,913
The Lieutenant
is asking the questions.

914
02:24:05,119 --> 02:24:06,711
We're charged with

915
02:24:10,239 --> 02:24:12,958
apprehending the hostiles,
recovering stolen property,

916
02:24:13,439 --> 02:24:15,509
retrieving white captives
taken in raids.

917
02:24:16,479 --> 02:24:17,594
There are no hostiles.

918
02:24:17,919 --> 02:24:19,511
We'll be the judge of that.

919
02:24:20,159 --> 02:24:21,751
If you guide us to these camps,

920
02:24:22,399 --> 02:24:24,959
your conduct will be reevaluated.

921
02:24:26,079 --> 02:24:27,034
What conduct?

922
02:24:27,679 --> 02:24:28,953
Your status as

923
02:24:29,279 --> 02:24:31,509
a traitor might improve
if you cooperate

924
02:24:31,999 --> 02:24:33,114
with the U.S. Army.

925
02:24:35,679 --> 02:24:37,431
There's nothing for you
to do out here.

926
02:24:41,439 --> 02:24:42,713
Are you willing to cooperate?

927
02:24:46,399 --> 02:24:47,036
Speak up!

928
02:24:50,879 --> 02:24:53,439
I am Dances With Wolves,

929
02:24:56,799 --> 02:24:57,436
What's that?

930
02:24:57,919 --> 02:25:00,149
I am Dances With Wolves!

931
02:25:00,639 --> 02:25:02,709
I have nothing to say to you,

932
02:25:03,039 --> 02:25:05,917
You are not worth talking to,

933
02:25:15,679 --> 02:25:17,909
Form a detail and take this man
to the river.

934
02:25:20,159 --> 02:25:21,274
Let him clean up his face.

935
02:25:24,639 --> 02:25:25,594
Not you, Spivey.

936
02:26:01,599 --> 02:26:02,554
Hey, Spivey.

937
02:26:08,479 --> 02:26:09,434
You got paper?

938
02:26:09,919 --> 02:26:12,308
- What's it to you?
- Well, give me some.

939
02:26:13,439 --> 02:26:14,235
Can you read?

940
02:26:14,719 --> 02:26:17,438
No, I can't read.
You can't read either.

941
02:26:17,919 --> 02:26:19,034
Just give me some.

942
02:26:20,159 --> 02:26:21,751
Give me some!

943
02:26:21,919 --> 02:26:23,671
All right! Hold your horses.

944
02:27:56,639 --> 02:27:57,913
Lap it up, Injun. Lap it up.

945
02:28:02,239 --> 02:28:03,513
Son of a bitch. I'll kill you.

946
02:28:06,559 --> 02:28:07,355
It's all right.

947
02:28:08,639 --> 02:28:09,435
It's all right.

948
02:28:10,559 --> 02:28:11,992
You're just gonna get hungrier.

949
02:28:12,839 --> 02:28:14,397
But maybe that don't matter.

950
02:28:15,359 --> 02:28:17,111
They're gonna ship you
back to Hays.

951
02:28:18,079 --> 02:28:19,353
And once you get there,

952
02:28:19,999 --> 02:28:21,273
they gonna hang you.

953
02:28:24,799 --> 02:28:26,710
Forget about him. Get out of here.

954
02:29:07,999 --> 02:29:09,591
Spivey, what is that?

955
02:29:10,079 --> 02:29:11,831
Looks like he's following us.

956
02:29:12,479 --> 02:29:13,753
Hell, I'm gonna shoot him.

957
02:29:15,839 --> 02:29:16,954
You missed him.

958
02:29:17,279 --> 02:29:18,234
Don't shoot.

959
02:29:18,879 --> 02:29:20,790
- It's my shot.
- Wait, I saw him first.

960
02:29:21,119 --> 02:29:22,711
That stupid bastard
ain't even moving.

961
02:29:24,639 --> 02:29:26,391
Wait a minute, that's my shot.

962
02:29:28,479 --> 02:29:30,390
Get him. He's standing there.

963
02:29:30,719 --> 02:29:32,949
- He ain't hurt, is he?
- Shoot him!

964
02:29:50,479 --> 02:29:51,753
He might've killed you.

965
02:30:20,399 --> 02:30:21,354
I got him!

966
02:30:21,879 --> 02:30:23,551
I got him!

967
02:30:26,159 --> 02:30:27,114
Dead shot, boys. Come on.

968
02:30:28,719 --> 02:30:31,108
Son of a bitch. Get up!

969
02:30:33,519 --> 02:30:34,315
Get up!

970
02:30:35,279 --> 02:30:36,553
I'll kill you.

971
02:30:41,519 --> 02:30:44,238
Stop bashing him or
I'll put shackles on you.

972
02:30:45,039 --> 02:30:45,835
You men get back here!

973
02:30:51,119 --> 02:30:52,234
God damnit.

974
02:31:44,719 --> 02:31:45,834
Let's go.

975
02:32:09,199 --> 02:32:10,154
I don't see nobody.

976
02:38:10,159 --> 02:38:12,229
Dances With Wolves

977
02:38:12,719 --> 02:38:14,789
is quiet these days,

978
02:38:16,399 --> 02:38:17,832
Is his heart bad?

979
02:38:27,439 --> 02:38:30,317
Killing the soldiers at the river

980
02:38:32,879 --> 02:38:34,631
was a good thing,

981
02:38:36,079 --> 02:38:37,990
I did not mind killing those men,
I was glad to do it,

982
02:38:42,479 --> 02:38:44,390
But the soldiers

983
02:38:45,039 --> 02:38:48,076
hate me now,
like they hate no other,

984
02:38:49,359 --> 02:38:51,429
They think I am a traitor,

985
02:38:56,719 --> 02:38:59,108
And they will hunt for me,

986
02:39:00,079 --> 02:39:03,116
And they find me,
they find you,

987
02:39:05,359 --> 02:39:06,474
I think it would be wise

988
02:39:07,119 --> 02:39:08,393
to move the village now,

989
02:39:09,039 --> 02:39:11,109
As soon as possible,

990
02:39:17,839 --> 02:39:18,954
I will be leaving,

991
02:39:22,159 --> 02:39:24,070
I must go and talk with those
who would listen,

992
02:39:31,479 --> 02:39:33,788
Quiet,
You are hurting my ears,

993
02:40:06,639 --> 02:40:08,869
You are the only white man

994
02:40:09,359 --> 02:40:10,314
I have ever known,

995
02:40:10,639 --> 02:40:13,995
I have thought about you a lot,
More than you know,

996
02:40:14,639 --> 02:40:17,517
But I think you are wrong,

997
02:40:18,799 --> 02:40:21,359
The man the soldiers are looking for
no longer exists,

998
02:40:22,319 --> 02:40:23,434
Now there is only

999
02:40:23,919 --> 02:40:26,149
a Sioux named

1000
02:40:26,479 --> 02:40:27,912
Dances With Wolves,

1001
02:40:31,919 --> 02:40:33,352
Let's smoke awhile,

1002
02:40:39,759 --> 02:40:41,829
With Ten Bears,
it was always more than a while,

1003
02:40:42,159 --> 02:40:43,433
Everything he did had a purpose,

1004
02:40:43,759 --> 02:40:45,351
He wanted me to stay,

1005
02:40:45,839 --> 02:40:48,876
But I would be an excuse,
all the army needed

1006
02:40:49,199 --> 02:40:51,429
to find this place,

1007
02:40:51,599 --> 02:40:54,159
I pushed him to move the camp,

1008
02:40:54,479 --> 02:40:57,357
But in the end, he only smiled
and talked of simple pleasures,

1009
02:40:57,679 --> 02:41:01,354
He reminded me that at his age,
a good fire is better than anything,

1010
02:41:02,159 --> 02:41:04,229
Ten Bears was an extraordinary man,

1011
02:41:44,239 --> 02:41:45,513
You have nothing to say?

1012
02:41:48,239 --> 02:41:49,513
What can I tell you?

1013
02:41:51,439 --> 02:41:52,713
Whatever's on your mind.

1014
02:41:59,759 --> 02:42:01,351
You've made the decision.

1015
02:42:05,999 --> 02:42:07,591
My place is with you.

1016
02:42:08,719 --> 02:42:10,152
I go where you go.

1017
02:42:13,679 --> 02:42:14,794
You're not afraid?

1018
02:42:20,399 --> 02:42:22,788
I told Ten Bears we'd leave
when the snow breaks.

1019
02:42:30,479 --> 02:42:31,753
Did you tell everyone?

1020
02:42:36,079 --> 02:42:37,353
Not everyone.

1021
02:43:12,559 --> 02:43:13,833
It's all right,

1022
02:43:46,319 --> 02:43:46,956
You...

1023
02:43:48,399 --> 02:43:49,991
finish your pipe?

1024
02:44:02,799 --> 02:44:03,595
The pipe...

1025
02:44:05,359 --> 02:44:05,996
How...

1026
02:44:07,439 --> 02:44:08,394
does it smoke?

1027
02:44:11,599 --> 02:44:12,873
I've never smoked it.

1028
02:44:24,239 --> 02:44:25,513
We come far,

1029
02:44:25,999 --> 02:44:26,954
you and me.

1030
02:44:29,719 --> 02:44:31,118
I will not forget you.

1031
02:46:15,919 --> 02:46:17,352
Dances With Wolves!

1032
02:46:19,599 --> 02:46:21,510
I am Wind In His Hair,

1033
02:46:22,639 --> 02:46:25,028
Do you see that I am your friend?

1034
02:46:25,679 --> 02:46:27,590
I am your friend!

1035
02:46:29,359 --> 02:46:32,078
Can you see that you will
always be my friend?
