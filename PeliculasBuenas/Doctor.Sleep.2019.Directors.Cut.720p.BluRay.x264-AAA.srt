1
00:00:45,351 --> 00:00:46,995
Where you going, Violet?

2
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:49,019
Just to pick some flowers.

3
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,920
Don't wander too far.

4
00:01:23,922 --> 00:01:29,370
<i>♪ My wild Irish rose ♪</i>

5
00:01:29,394 --> 00:01:34,775
<i>♪ The sweetest flower that grows ♪</i>

6
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,145
<i>♪ You may search everywhere ♪</i>

7
00:01:38,169 --> 00:01:40,748
<i>♪ But none can compare ♪</i>

8
00:01:40,772 --> 00:01:47,456
<i>♪ With my wild Irish rose ♪</i>

9
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,880
Well, hi there.

10
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:51,994
Where did you find those?

11
00:01:52,218 --> 00:01:54,429
I know all the secret places.

12
00:01:54,853 --> 00:01:56,253
Do you want one?

13
00:02:06,665 --> 00:02:08,865
You're wondering why
I'm wearing such a funny hat.

14
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:11,934
I always wear this hat.

15
00:02:12,505 --> 00:02:14,605
So much, it's a part of my name now.

16
00:02:15,207 --> 00:02:16,607
My friends...

17
00:02:17,143 --> 00:02:19,106
my very, very best friends,

18
00:02:19,107 --> 00:02:21,356
they just call me.
Rose the Hat.

19
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,780
It looks like a magician's hat.

20
00:02:24,482 --> 00:02:25,782
It is.

21
00:02:26,218 --> 00:02:28,518
It's a magic hat.

22
00:02:28,821 --> 00:02:29,921
Do you wanna see?

23
00:02:31,923 --> 00:02:33,323
Nothing up my sleeves.

24
00:02:36,594 --> 00:02:37,694
Nothing in my hat.

25
00:02:40,465 --> 00:02:41,765
Don't worry, that's my friend.

26
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:43,099
You're missing the trick.

27
00:02:43,334 --> 00:02:44,534
Reach inside.

28
00:02:51,476 --> 00:02:52,853
It's so pretty.

29
00:02:52,877 --> 00:02:54,321
Because it's special.

30
00:02:54,545 --> 00:02:56,545
And speaking of special,

31
00:02:56,682 --> 00:02:58,982
you're a little magic too, aren't you?

32
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,448
The flower in my hand,

33
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:03,649
what color is it?

34
00:03:05,256 --> 00:03:06,756
Oh, it's ok honey.

35
00:03:07,393 --> 00:03:08,924
You won't scare me.

36
00:03:08,925 --> 00:03:09,925
I promise.

37
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,360
Purple.

38
00:03:18,369 --> 00:03:19,669
Violet...

39
00:03:20,771 --> 00:03:21,871
like you.

40
00:03:24,977 --> 00:03:26,677
You don't eat flowers.

41
00:03:26,845 --> 00:03:27,988
But you do.

42
00:03:28,212 --> 00:03:29,612
But these are special.

43
00:03:30,316 --> 00:03:31,559
Honey,

44
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,400
it's the special ones that taste best.

45
00:03:37,155 --> 00:03:39,133
I should get back to my mom.

46
00:03:39,157 --> 00:03:41,957
No, stay. Stay awhile.
See more magic.

47
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,400
You are a special little thing,
aren't you?

48
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,308
Violet?

49
00:03:59,178 --> 00:04:00,278
Violet!

50
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:08,318
Violet!

51
00:04:11,323 --> 00:04:12,323
Vi...

52
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:45,769
Please.

53
00:07:52,678 --> 00:07:54,878
Hey. It's ok, Doc.

54
00:07:56,315 --> 00:07:57,515
It's ok.

55
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:04,688
There.

56
00:08:05,123 --> 00:08:06,323
All dry.

57
00:08:09,627 --> 00:08:10,927
What happened?

58
00:08:14,298 --> 00:08:16,198
You have to talk to me, Danny.

59
00:08:17,902 --> 00:08:19,802
You haven't talked since we left...

60
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,740
Please, Doc.

61
00:08:25,344 --> 00:08:26,544
Please.

62
00:09:17,895 --> 00:09:18,941
So...

63
00:09:19,665 --> 00:09:21,565
you ain't talking, Doc?

64
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:29,571
Weren't talking much first time
I met you neither.

65
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:32,710
Little boy...

66
00:09:33,844 --> 00:09:37,924
set to spend a long winter
at that rotten old place.

67
00:09:38,349 --> 00:09:40,549
Just him and his mommy and daddy.

68
00:09:40,685 --> 00:09:43,545
Daddy as dark as that boy is bright.

69
00:09:44,623 --> 00:09:45,870
And boy...

70
00:09:45,871 --> 00:09:49,271
is he bright. He's shining like fire...

71
00:09:50,395 --> 00:09:52,195
in the one place...

72
00:09:52,763 --> 00:09:55,463
the worst place for
someone who shines.

73
00:09:57,868 --> 00:10:00,698
You remember the first time
we really talked?

74
00:10:01,005 --> 00:10:03,205
When I spoke up inside your head?

75
00:10:04,408 --> 00:10:06,208
<i>Made you feel good, right?</i>

76
00:10:06,677 --> 00:10:08,522
<i>Knowing you weren't alone.</i>

77
00:10:08,646 --> 00:10:10,046
Daddy tried to kill me.

78
00:10:11,717 --> 00:10:13,818
It wasn't all him, you gotta know.

79
00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:18,119
That place fed his dark,
like it fed on your light.

80
00:10:18,623 --> 00:10:20,823
And he had some light in him, too.

81
00:10:21,993 --> 00:10:24,593
Just like you got some dark.

82
00:10:24,662 --> 00:10:26,462
We all got both.

83
00:10:26,698 --> 00:10:28,398
It's not done with me.

84
00:10:30,334 --> 00:10:34,334
It ever strike you funny
how I showed up when I did?

85
00:10:34,473 --> 00:10:36,373
When you needed me.

86
00:10:36,474 --> 00:10:38,774
Someone did that for me, too.

87
00:10:39,877 --> 00:10:42,577
My grandma, taught me,

88
00:10:42,714 --> 00:10:44,514
and I taught you.

89
00:10:44,849 --> 00:10:48,849
And some day Danny Torrance,
you'll teach someone else.

90
00:10:49,354 --> 00:10:50,354
I won't.

91
00:10:51,422 --> 00:10:52,522
Oh, you won't?

92
00:10:53,023 --> 00:10:54,323
I won't shine, I mean.

93
00:10:54,358 --> 00:10:56,658
No more. It's dangerous.

94
00:10:58,497 --> 00:11:00,997
Reckon it is, sometimes.

95
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:03,199
She found me.

96
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:05,601
She'll come back and come back
until she gets me.

97
00:11:06,872 --> 00:11:08,172
You're right.

98
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,461
The Overlook's condemned.

99
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,699
Boarded up.
They're starving old ghosts,

100
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,700
and they're reaching out for you.

101
00:11:14,746 --> 00:11:16,746
Won't stop with her, either.

102
00:11:16,982 --> 00:11:18,682
Pictures in a book.

103
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:21,770
You said they were just pictures in
a book and they couldn't hurt me.

104
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,190
Some things,

105
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,651
dark things,

106
00:11:29,052 --> 00:11:30,852
the shining's like food.

107
00:11:30,896 --> 00:11:33,196
They're mosquitoes landing for blood.

108
00:11:36,368 --> 00:11:37,668
The Overlook,

109
00:11:37,969 --> 00:11:41,269
it was always just pictures to me.

110
00:11:41,873 --> 00:11:44,073
But I didn't shine like you.

111
00:11:45,444 --> 00:11:47,644
Nobody shines like you.

112
00:11:48,412 --> 00:11:52,959
So, you in that damn hotel, you
was like a million-watt battery

113
00:11:52,983 --> 00:11:54,728
all plugged in.

114
00:11:54,852 --> 00:11:55,863
And it ate it up.

115
00:11:56,387 --> 00:11:57,487
You made it real.

116
00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:00,189
Started soon as you
walked through the door.

117
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:03,771
Can't do nothing about that,
I'm sorry to tell you,

118
00:12:03,795 --> 00:12:05,006
but you're not a child.

119
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,530
You're older now.

120
00:12:07,065 --> 00:12:08,765
Much older in a way.

121
00:12:09,368 --> 00:12:10,835
You gotta hear this.

122
00:12:11,902 --> 00:12:14,102
World's a hungry place.

123
00:12:15,507 --> 00:12:19,107
And the darkest things are the hungriest
and they'll eat what shines.

124
00:12:19,511 --> 00:12:22,712
Swarm it like mosquitoes or leeches.

125
00:12:22,914 --> 00:12:24,614
Can't do nothing about that.

126
00:12:27,051 --> 00:12:28,751
But what you can do...

127
00:12:29,854 --> 00:12:33,154
is turn what they come for
against them.

128
00:12:37,396 --> 00:12:38,863
My grandfather,

129
00:12:40,098 --> 00:12:42,498
he was a mean son of a bitch.

130
00:12:44,402 --> 00:12:45,747
Dark inside.

131
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:47,771
Same type of dark as your dad.

132
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,017
Beat me senseless,
and my grandma too,

133
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,041
and when he died, I danced.

134
00:12:53,744 --> 00:12:55,844
But he kept on coming back.

135
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,316
Standing in my room.

136
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,530
Suit all gray and stinking

137
00:13:02,554 --> 00:13:05,358
from whatever mold was
growing on him in that box.

138
00:13:06,825 --> 00:13:08,094
One day,

139
00:13:08,495 --> 00:13:09,718
he grabbed me,

140
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:11,619
and he was real.

141
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,774
His nails were long,

142
00:13:14,998 --> 00:13:17,898
from growing in the grave
and they cut me, Doc.

143
00:13:18,703 --> 00:13:20,303
Cut me deep.

144
00:13:21,705 --> 00:13:23,475
So, Grandma...

145
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,910
she taught me a trick.

146
00:13:30,648 --> 00:13:32,348
Gave me a present.

147
00:13:34,084 --> 00:13:37,584
I want you to know this box,

148
00:13:38,489 --> 00:13:40,089
inside and out.

149
00:13:40,592 --> 00:13:42,492
Don't just look at it.
Touch it.

150
00:13:44,896 --> 00:13:47,396
Stick your nose inside
and see if there is a smell.

151
00:13:48,467 --> 00:13:50,967
Know every corner,

152
00:13:51,036 --> 00:13:52,636
every single thing.

153
00:13:53,137 --> 00:13:54,337
Why?

154
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,740
Because you're gonna build one
just like it in your mind.

155
00:13:59,044 --> 00:14:00,744
One even more special.

156
00:14:03,547 --> 00:14:05,847
So next time that bitch comes around,

157
00:14:08,252 --> 00:14:09,552
you'll be ready.

158
00:14:12,089 --> 00:14:13,989
Let's get you back to Mama.

159
00:14:14,658 --> 00:14:16,158
Wendy'll worry,

160
00:14:16,727 --> 00:14:19,627
and she shouldn't have to worry
another day in her life.

161
00:14:20,998 --> 00:14:23,898
That woman's paid her debt.

162
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:29,139
Danny!

163
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:32,209
Danny!

164
00:14:35,747 --> 00:14:36,747
Danny!

165
00:14:38,116 --> 00:14:39,816
There you are.

166
00:14:40,551 --> 00:14:41,951
Where did you go?

167
00:14:44,256 --> 00:14:46,156
You scared me half to death.

168
00:14:48,026 --> 00:14:49,373
Don't you do that to me.

169
00:14:49,774 --> 00:14:50,774
You hear?

170
00:14:50,862 --> 00:14:52,762
Don't you ever do that to me.

171
00:14:53,565 --> 00:14:54,934
Don't ever do that to me.

172
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:27,134
Yeah, Mom. I'm ok.

173
00:17:01,925 --> 00:17:04,025
And what's your name again, cutie?
Dan.

174
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:05,161
Dan.

175
00:17:39,998 --> 00:17:42,098
I was having a drink
with the lady, alright?

176
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,068
Hey. You're gonna take...

177
00:18:02,469 --> 00:18:03,445
your...

178
00:18:03,946 --> 00:18:05,146
medicine.

179
00:18:05,256 --> 00:18:06,099
Get off him.

180
00:18:06,123 --> 00:18:07,358
Get up. Get out of here.

181
00:18:28,246 --> 00:18:30,090
Shit.
I think you killed him.

182
00:18:30,914 --> 00:18:32,426
What if you killed him?

183
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,350
I hope you killed him.

184
00:18:35,051 --> 00:18:36,051
You hear me?

185
00:18:37,921 --> 00:18:39,190
Let me kiss it better.

186
00:18:49,234 --> 00:18:50,234
No.

187
00:18:51,068 --> 00:18:52,868
No, no, no.

188
00:18:53,103 --> 00:18:55,103
No, no, no, no, no, no.

189
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,758
What the...

190
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:58,359
No.

191
00:19:42,586 --> 00:19:43,686
Mommy?

192
00:19:52,296 --> 00:19:53,996
What's your name, hero?

193
00:19:59,136 --> 00:20:01,205
Mommy?
Baby.

194
00:20:02,006 --> 00:20:03,806
Here, here.

195
00:20:10,414 --> 00:20:12,714
<i>You can put her money back, Doc.</i>

196
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,250
<i>You can do that much.</i>

197
00:20:15,886 --> 00:20:17,386
She took mine.

198
00:20:17,622 --> 00:20:20,022
She probably bought the coke with it.

199
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,490
<i>Doc.</i>

200
00:20:34,171 --> 00:20:35,471
Oh no, Doc.

201
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,674
You can put things from
the Overlook away in boxes,

202
00:20:37,675 --> 00:20:39,475
but not memories.

203
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:41,811
Never those.

204
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:44,379
They're the real ghosts.

205
00:20:44,615 --> 00:20:46,415
You take them with you.

206
00:21:29,526 --> 00:21:31,170
Time for bed, Abra.

207
00:21:31,294 --> 00:21:33,006
A little more.

208
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,330
No more, sweetie.

209
00:21:34,364 --> 00:21:35,975
Big day tomorrow.

210
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:37,199
Birthday party!

211
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,200
That's right.
Yeah.

212
00:21:38,236 --> 00:21:39,946
Now, what time is it?

213
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:42,170
Bedtime.
You know it's bedtime.

214
00:21:44,007 --> 00:21:45,107
Good night, sweetheart.

215
00:23:25,008 --> 00:23:26,008
Andi?

216
00:23:27,178 --> 00:23:28,178
That's right.

217
00:23:30,715 --> 00:23:32,915
You're prettier than your picture.

218
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:36,519
And you're older than yours.

219
00:23:38,989 --> 00:23:42,189
Are we staying here
or going somewhere?

220
00:23:45,496 --> 00:23:47,196
Don't you wanna watch the movie?

221
00:24:00,344 --> 00:24:02,156
I don't see what the fuss is about.

222
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,606
Chat room romance.
Little gross.

223
00:24:04,607 --> 00:24:06,007
Not interesting.

224
00:24:06,084 --> 00:24:07,484
Just watch.

225
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,219
It's interesting, I promise.

226
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,066
Well, it better be, because
she's not all that steamy.

227
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:14,669
And there she goes.

228
00:24:15,093 --> 00:24:16,593
Aren't you tired?

229
00:24:18,261 --> 00:24:19,361
Sleep.

230
00:24:31,275 --> 00:24:32,475
Ok.

231
00:24:39,283 --> 00:24:41,983
Wait. This is the best part.

232
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:45,122
I watched her do it three times
now and it never gets old.

233
00:24:46,657 --> 00:24:48,357
Sleep deeper,

234
00:24:48,492 --> 00:24:50,192
deep as you can.

235
00:24:51,462 --> 00:24:54,862
The pain you feel is only a dream.

236
00:24:56,601 --> 00:24:58,103
What will the pain be?

237
00:24:59,603 --> 00:25:01,003
A dream.

238
00:25:03,974 --> 00:25:05,568
You can explain,

239
00:25:05,769 --> 00:25:07,469
a lost wallet,

240
00:25:07,812 --> 00:25:09,612
when your wife asks.

241
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,280
But you can't explain this.

242
00:25:14,518 --> 00:25:16,074
This you'll see,

243
00:25:16,475 --> 00:25:18,290
every day when you look in the mirror.

244
00:25:19,457 --> 00:25:21,602
And every time you see it,

245
00:25:21,726 --> 00:25:24,126
you'll say out loud...

246
00:25:25,696 --> 00:25:28,196
I like little girls.

247
00:25:29,932 --> 00:25:31,432
You'll say it out loud.

248
00:25:31,902 --> 00:25:33,402
Out loud.

249
00:25:34,538 --> 00:25:36,288
And the next time,

250
00:25:36,689 --> 00:25:39,689
you go looking for a little girl online,

251
00:25:40,378 --> 00:25:42,094
I want you to remember,

252
00:25:42,795 --> 00:25:45,495
that time you got bit by a snake.

253
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,350
A snake in a white blouse,

254
00:25:49,886 --> 00:25:51,786
whose face is a blank.

255
00:26:01,565 --> 00:26:03,365
That is interesting.

256
00:26:12,977 --> 00:26:14,477
Excuse me, miss?

257
00:26:15,313 --> 00:26:16,502
Miss.

258
00:26:16,803 --> 00:26:18,503
Miss, you left something in the theater.

259
00:26:18,515 --> 00:26:19,851
You wanna leave me alone.

260
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:29,060
Well, hi there.

261
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,562
You wanna let me go.

262
00:26:33,264 --> 00:26:35,464
Oh, no, sweetie.

263
00:26:36,366 --> 00:26:37,666
No, I don't.

264
00:27:36,826 --> 00:27:38,829
How far can I get for this?

265
00:28:04,553 --> 00:28:05,553
Four of spades.

266
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:07,119
What color is this?

267
00:28:07,557 --> 00:28:09,382
Mommy, I made this for you.

268
00:28:09,383 --> 00:28:10,503
It's a secret card.

269
00:28:11,327 --> 00:28:12,527
Thank you, Abba-doo.

270
00:28:12,595 --> 00:28:15,095
Does anyone know a magic word?

271
00:28:17,298 --> 00:28:18,045
You.

272
00:28:18,869 --> 00:28:20,469
Abracadabra.

273
00:28:20,537 --> 00:28:22,338
Abracadabra.
That's a great one.

274
00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:22,902
Ok.

275
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:24,903
You hold the magic wand.

276
00:28:25,042 --> 00:28:27,242
Now, everyone,

277
00:28:27,444 --> 00:28:30,244
on the count of three, ok?

278
00:28:30,413 --> 00:28:33,327
One, two, three.
Two, three.

279
00:28:33,551 --> 00:28:35,751
Abracadabra.

280
00:28:36,821 --> 00:28:38,831
I know magic, too.

281
00:28:39,055 --> 00:28:42,055
Well, then you get to hold him,
birthday girl.

282
00:28:43,026 --> 00:28:45,426
There you go. You got him?

283
00:28:46,463 --> 00:28:47,657
For my next trick I'm...

284
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:49,158
Oh my goodness. Sorry.

285
00:28:49,332 --> 00:28:50,332
Sometimes, if I...

286
00:28:51,768 --> 00:28:52,768
Sorry.

287
00:28:54,604 --> 00:28:56,504
Has... Has anyone seen my spoons?

288
00:28:56,539 --> 00:28:58,351
I can do that.

289
00:28:58,375 --> 00:28:59,675
That's nice, sweetie.

290
00:28:59,943 --> 00:29:01,454
They're on you!
Oh, they're on me?

291
00:29:01,478 --> 00:29:02,778
Ok, make sure you guys don't do this.

292
00:29:14,792 --> 00:29:15,633
You know.

293
00:29:16,034 --> 00:29:17,434
We can forget about naptime.

294
00:29:17,761 --> 00:29:19,061
Just a few more hours.

295
00:29:22,767 --> 00:29:24,001
Say it with me.

296
00:29:24,002 --> 00:29:25,445
Just a few more hours.

297
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:27,229
Just a few more hours.

298
00:29:33,411 --> 00:29:34,711
What the hell?

299
00:29:43,687 --> 00:29:44,887
Dave...

300
00:29:58,401 --> 00:30:00,036
Abracadabra.

301
00:30:40,744 --> 00:30:42,444
Well, hi there sleepyhead.

302
00:30:42,813 --> 00:30:43,913
Sorry.

303
00:30:44,515 --> 00:30:46,515
I had to sleep you pretty hard.

304
00:30:46,883 --> 00:30:48,383
You're a tough one.

305
00:30:48,885 --> 00:30:50,185
Willful.

306
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,920
You know, I checked.

307
00:30:52,155 --> 00:30:54,667
Six men in three months

308
00:30:54,991 --> 00:30:57,291
with those little snakebite
tattoos on their cheeks.

309
00:30:58,494 --> 00:31:00,330
Why, you've been busy.

310
00:31:06,237 --> 00:31:09,737
Snakebite Andi, that's who you are.

311
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,684
So...

312
00:31:11,985 --> 00:31:13,085
who am I?

313
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:17,444
You're some crazy bitch
who kidnapped me.

314
00:31:18,082 --> 00:31:19,782
Just the truth from now on.

315
00:31:19,816 --> 00:31:21,616
You will only speak the truth.

316
00:31:24,721 --> 00:31:27,721
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

317
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:29,819
My God.

318
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,320
Works a little too well, don't it?

319
00:31:31,828 --> 00:31:33,103
Here's the deal,

320
00:31:33,504 --> 00:31:34,904
Snakebite Andi.

321
00:31:35,032 --> 00:31:36,135
You're a pusher?

322
00:31:36,536 --> 00:31:38,136
You can push people.

323
00:31:38,568 --> 00:31:40,880
We haven't had a pusher
around here for a little while,

324
00:31:40,904 --> 00:31:42,035
so...

325
00:31:42,036 --> 00:31:45,636
I'm gonna offer you a deal I haven't
offered anyone in almost 40 years.

326
00:31:47,277 --> 00:31:49,480
How old are you, darling?

327
00:31:50,948 --> 00:31:52,248
Fifteen.

328
00:31:52,315 --> 00:31:53,815
Fifteen?

329
00:31:54,117 --> 00:31:56,517
Oh, God, what an age.

330
00:31:57,321 --> 00:32:00,121
Springtime of your womanhood, isn't it?

331
00:32:02,191 --> 00:32:03,681
You're not a girl anymore,

332
00:32:03,694 --> 00:32:06,694
but you don't have
a single dent yet either.

333
00:32:07,297 --> 00:32:09,834
Gravity hasn't even noticed you.

334
00:32:10,601 --> 00:32:11,901
Not at 15.

335
00:32:13,703 --> 00:32:14,838
Men, though...

336
00:32:16,373 --> 00:32:17,873
No, no, no. No shame.

337
00:32:19,209 --> 00:32:22,709
You paid that back, didn't you?

338
00:32:23,846 --> 00:32:25,478
That's what I'm offering you.

339
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:27,279
Springtime forever.

340
00:32:27,317 --> 00:32:29,717
Ten years from now, you're still 15.

341
00:32:29,753 --> 00:32:32,053
A hundred, maybe 17.

342
00:32:33,856 --> 00:32:35,135
Eat well,

343
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:36,966
stay young,

344
00:32:37,367 --> 00:32:38,867
live long.

345
00:32:41,864 --> 00:32:44,043
So, you and your friend...

346
00:32:44,567 --> 00:32:46,567
Not my friend.
That's my family.

347
00:32:47,203 --> 00:32:49,403
We're the True Knot, dear.

348
00:32:51,874 --> 00:32:53,474
The True Knot?

349
00:32:53,943 --> 00:32:57,743
What's tied can never be untied.

350
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:12,989
You like it?

351
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:15,390
Sorry. I was just...

352
00:34:15,392 --> 00:34:17,692
That's ok.
People love to look at it.

353
00:34:18,696 --> 00:34:20,596
We used to set this up in the library.

354
00:34:20,698 --> 00:34:22,507
Community project, just...

355
00:34:22,808 --> 00:34:24,242
taking a life all its own.

356
00:34:24,243 --> 00:34:25,966
See, we started with
the clock tower there.

357
00:34:26,368 --> 00:34:27,868
Oh, yeah.
Just keeps growing.

358
00:34:28,705 --> 00:34:30,116
Kids call it Teenytown.

359
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,440
The kids build this?

360
00:34:31,942 --> 00:34:33,186
With some help, oh, yeah.

361
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:35,947
Keep it up,
build the whole town square.

362
00:34:37,948 --> 00:34:40,279
Are you off the bus or...

363
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,380
riding your thumb?

364
00:34:42,385 --> 00:34:43,395
Yeah, the bus.

365
00:34:44,019 --> 00:34:46,032
Not many ride the bus this far north.

366
00:34:46,456 --> 00:34:48,256
Unless they're looking for work.

367
00:34:51,462 --> 00:34:52,462
Yeah.

368
00:34:54,131 --> 00:34:56,297
Change of scenery or...

369
00:34:56,498 --> 00:34:58,298
you running away from something?

370
00:35:00,203 --> 00:35:01,980
Oh, don't mind me.
I hope I'm...

371
00:35:02,004 --> 00:35:03,183
New face is all.

372
00:35:03,507 --> 00:35:04,507
Yeah.

373
00:35:04,841 --> 00:35:07,341
Guess I'm running away
from myself, I guess.

374
00:35:08,312 --> 00:35:09,412
Oh, yeah.

375
00:35:10,513 --> 00:35:12,091
I know that look.

376
00:35:12,892 --> 00:35:14,592
Too well, I'm sorry to say.

377
00:35:15,986 --> 00:35:18,586
Running away from yourself.
That is a pickle.

378
00:35:20,757 --> 00:35:22,435
You take yourself
with you wherever you go.

379
00:35:22,759 --> 00:35:24,106
Ain't that the bitch?

380
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,130
Rent's 85 a week,

381
00:35:28,331 --> 00:35:29,431
payable up front.

382
00:35:29,732 --> 00:35:31,151
Billy paid your first two,

383
00:35:31,152 --> 00:35:32,352
rest's on you.

384
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:36,170
No pets, no parties, no noise.

385
00:35:36,906 --> 00:35:38,706
I'm a quiet tenant.

386
00:35:39,576 --> 00:35:41,113
Last guy said the same.

387
00:35:41,114 --> 00:35:42,714
Math student.

388
00:35:43,712 --> 00:35:45,590
Even let him paint the wall
all blackboard,

389
00:35:45,614 --> 00:35:48,114
so he could scribble
his little puzzles up there.

390
00:35:48,652 --> 00:35:49,889
Wasn't quiet.

391
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:50,890
No, sir.

392
00:35:51,554 --> 00:35:53,205
Didn't even paint over this when he left,

393
00:35:53,206 --> 00:35:54,606
but I'm glad he didn't,

394
00:35:54,824 --> 00:35:56,924
because I can make this easy for ya,

395
00:35:57,427 --> 00:35:59,396
so you see it every morning
when you wake.

396
00:36:02,732 --> 00:36:04,677
You sure you wanna
vouch for this pup?

397
00:36:04,701 --> 00:36:05,701
Pretty sure.

398
00:36:06,235 --> 00:36:07,471
It's your ass, Billy.

399
00:36:08,538 --> 00:36:10,338
Bleeding heart, this one.

400
00:36:12,909 --> 00:36:15,409
I'm downstairs, ground floor,
if you need anything.

401
00:36:16,478 --> 00:36:18,578
Find me tomorrow,
talk about some work.

402
00:36:20,549 --> 00:36:21,849
Why are you doing this?

403
00:36:22,786 --> 00:36:23,786
You don't know me.

404
00:36:24,353 --> 00:36:25,553
No, I don't.

405
00:36:26,155 --> 00:36:28,055
But I know the look, like I said.

406
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:30,732
And sometimes I...

407
00:36:31,034 --> 00:36:32,573
get this feeling about people.

408
00:36:32,696 --> 00:36:33,796
Hard to understand, I guess.

409
00:36:35,632 --> 00:36:36,932
Easier than you think.

410
00:36:38,902 --> 00:36:40,202
Thanks.
Alright.

411
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,924
You ready?

412
00:37:05,761 --> 00:37:06,961
She's ready.

413
00:37:12,368 --> 00:37:13,468
Who...
Who are these people?

414
00:37:13,737 --> 00:37:15,037
You'll find out after.

415
00:37:16,173 --> 00:37:17,973
That over there is Grampa Flick,

416
00:37:18,175 --> 00:37:19,575
and he'll lead us.
Lie down.

417
00:37:20,909 --> 00:37:21,909
There.

418
00:37:26,683 --> 00:37:27,878
No fear.

419
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,780
You understand?

420
00:37:38,728 --> 00:37:40,528
We are the True Knot,

421
00:37:41,297 --> 00:37:42,797
and we endure.

422
00:37:45,634 --> 00:37:47,634
We are the chosen ones.

423
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:52,639
We are the fortunate ones.

424
00:37:55,744 --> 00:37:59,744
What is tied cannot be untied.

425
00:38:02,851 --> 00:38:04,551
Here is a woman.

426
00:38:05,621 --> 00:38:06,921
Would she join us?

427
00:38:09,092 --> 00:38:11,532
Would she tie her life,

428
00:38:12,034 --> 00:38:13,534
to our life?

429
00:38:14,331 --> 00:38:15,331
Yes.

430
00:38:15,531 --> 00:38:16,941
Yes.

431
00:38:16,965 --> 00:38:18,865
Say yes.

432
00:38:21,138 --> 00:38:22,138
Yes.

433
00:38:24,074 --> 00:38:25,976
This one's special.

434
00:38:26,976 --> 00:38:28,576
Her name's Violet.

435
00:38:28,777 --> 00:38:30,477
There's not much of her left.

436
00:38:31,915 --> 00:38:33,515
And she tastes...

437
00:38:35,585 --> 00:38:37,085
like flowers.

438
00:38:59,808 --> 00:39:01,586
Breathe deep.

439
00:39:08,485 --> 00:39:12,185
There. Embrace it.

440
00:39:16,426 --> 00:39:17,626
Embrace it.

441
00:39:29,505 --> 00:39:30,505
No!

442
00:39:32,107 --> 00:39:34,807
No! No!

443
00:40:27,563 --> 00:40:29,163
They haven't found us yet.

444
00:40:31,567 --> 00:40:33,767
They were used to hearing him cry,

445
00:40:34,069 --> 00:40:36,769
because I left him alone so much.

446
00:40:39,042 --> 00:40:40,942
So they didn't do anything.

447
00:40:44,179 --> 00:40:46,379
And they haven't found us yet.

448
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:55,590
Mommy?

449
00:41:20,049 --> 00:41:21,149
Oh, hey.

450
00:41:22,552 --> 00:41:24,652
You said that you knew my look.

451
00:41:25,721 --> 00:41:27,021
Well, what did you mean?

452
00:41:28,757 --> 00:41:29,757
Brother...

453
00:41:31,194 --> 00:41:32,394
you're sick.

454
00:41:33,128 --> 00:41:35,128
You're tired.
I can see that much.

455
00:41:37,299 --> 00:41:39,999
But you're sick and tired
of being sick and tired.

456
00:41:43,973 --> 00:41:45,073
I need help.

457
00:41:49,779 --> 00:41:50,779
Come on in.

458
00:41:51,246 --> 00:41:52,546
We'll talk about it.

459
00:41:55,884 --> 00:42:00,284
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change,

460
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:02,990
the courage to change the things I can,

461
00:42:03,025 --> 00:42:05,225
and the wisdom
to know the difference.

462
00:42:05,895 --> 00:42:07,895
Well, Bobbie's got a big birthday today.

463
00:42:07,897 --> 00:42:09,307
Three years. Three years sober.

464
00:42:09,331 --> 00:42:10,631
Yeah.

465
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:15,246
I'm so proud of you.

466
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:16,370
Thanks, John.

467
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:22,709
Now, am I forgetting anybody...

468
00:42:23,078 --> 00:42:25,278
Does anybody got a year?
Or six months?

469
00:42:26,148 --> 00:42:28,548
Well, now for the most important
person in the room. Is...

470
00:42:28,861 --> 00:42:30,361
anybody here a newbie?

471
00:42:32,654 --> 00:42:34,154
Somebody got 24 hours?

472
00:42:37,627 --> 00:42:38,628
Yeah.

473
00:42:46,302 --> 00:42:47,502
New to town?

474
00:42:48,136 --> 00:42:49,436
Yeah, I...

475
00:42:49,437 --> 00:42:51,737
Nothing personal.
I delivered half the people in the room.

476
00:42:52,008 --> 00:42:54,608
Just new faces pop, that's all.
This here is Dan Torrance.

477
00:42:54,643 --> 00:42:56,143
He's fresh off the bus.
Hey.

478
00:42:56,712 --> 00:42:58,512
Fresh off the ground, by the look.

479
00:43:00,949 --> 00:43:02,449
There's no judgment here, brother.

480
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:04,095
I mean, we've all been there.

481
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:05,619
And worse, trust me.
Oh, yeah.

482
00:43:06,288 --> 00:43:08,988
Doc, he's served our town
most my life.

483
00:43:09,157 --> 00:43:10,369
Delivered my baby brother.

484
00:43:10,393 --> 00:43:12,093
Yeah.
How is Frankie these days?

485
00:43:13,696 --> 00:43:15,096
Well, he'll find his way back.

486
00:43:15,197 --> 00:43:17,397
You know, he's got a good heart
under it all.

487
00:43:17,866 --> 00:43:20,666
Billy really tried with him.
Well, we all did.

488
00:43:21,703 --> 00:43:24,315
Well, Billy, you know, if you're
looking for a wing to climb under...

489
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:26,939
I can't say you'll do any better
than Billy Freeman here.

490
00:43:27,843 --> 00:43:29,843
Thank you for your hospitality.
I...

491
00:43:31,447 --> 00:43:32,747
I'm a little, little...

492
00:43:34,049 --> 00:43:35,649
I guess I'm not used to it.

493
00:43:35,985 --> 00:43:37,084
Well, you know we say,

494
00:43:37,086 --> 00:43:39,186
You can't judge someone till
you know their whole story.

495
00:43:39,389 --> 00:43:41,032
You might think you understand but,

496
00:43:41,356 --> 00:43:42,356
you don't.
You don't.

497
00:43:43,793 --> 00:43:45,093
So, how are you today?
Alright?

498
00:43:45,127 --> 00:43:46,327
Train's still running.

499
00:43:46,362 --> 00:43:47,762
That's good to hear.

500
00:43:48,597 --> 00:43:49,597
You good?

501
00:43:49,866 --> 00:43:50,966
Yeah. Yeah.

502
00:43:52,201 --> 00:43:53,378
Well, good to know you, Dan.

503
00:43:53,502 --> 00:43:54,502
Yeah.
Come again.

504
00:43:54,804 --> 00:43:56,014
Thanks.
Hope to see you again soon.

505
00:43:56,038 --> 00:43:57,338
I'll... I'll come back, yeah.

506
00:43:58,675 --> 00:44:00,048
Really good man. He's...

507
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:01,350
got a gift...

508
00:44:01,377 --> 00:44:02,777
Yeah. Hey, Billy, hang on.

509
00:44:03,179 --> 00:44:04,179
Hey, Doc.

510
00:44:06,715 --> 00:44:07,815
Your watch.

511
00:44:09,351 --> 00:44:11,651
You lost your watch.
You were worried about the kid with...

512
00:44:12,455 --> 00:44:13,755
Goodch... Goocher's.

513
00:44:15,891 --> 00:44:16,891
What?

514
00:44:16,892 --> 00:44:20,041
The kid with Goocher's or Gaucher's.

515
00:44:20,043 --> 00:44:21,543
The bone thing.

516
00:44:24,299 --> 00:44:25,699
Gaucher's disease.

517
00:44:26,201 --> 00:44:27,201
Right.

518
00:44:27,202 --> 00:44:29,371
You were washing your hands
in the hospital bathroom and...

519
00:44:29,372 --> 00:44:31,572
you left it on the soap dispenser.

520
00:44:34,177 --> 00:44:35,777
Well, just check on the soap dispenser.

521
00:44:36,746 --> 00:44:38,046
It's good to meet you.
Yeah.

522
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:45,319
How did you know?

523
00:44:46,889 --> 00:44:48,089
I wish I could say.

524
00:44:50,259 --> 00:44:51,359
Lucky guess.

525
00:44:54,631 --> 00:44:55,731
My ass.

526
00:44:57,333 --> 00:44:58,745
Intuition, I suppose.

527
00:44:58,747 --> 00:45:01,147
Like a feeling in my gut.
Maybe a...

528
00:45:02,772 --> 00:45:03,772
A lucky guess.

529
00:45:04,906 --> 00:45:06,106
What do you wanna do here?

530
00:45:08,043 --> 00:45:09,043
What do you mean?

531
00:45:09,111 --> 00:45:10,813
I mean here in Frazier.

532
00:45:11,215 --> 00:45:12,415
Why are you here?

533
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,700
And don't bullshit me, Dan.
I'm...

534
00:45:15,651 --> 00:45:17,251
prone to gut feelings of my own.

535
00:45:19,222 --> 00:45:19,842
I don't know.

536
00:45:19,844 --> 00:45:20,944
I don't know.

537
00:45:21,389 --> 00:45:24,189
Something, different
than I've been doing.

538
00:45:26,328 --> 00:45:27,428
Something better.

539
00:45:29,331 --> 00:45:30,731
Anything's better, frankly.

540
00:45:31,467 --> 00:45:32,667
You go to church?

541
00:45:34,002 --> 00:45:35,202
Does it matter?

542
00:45:35,203 --> 00:45:36,803
Do you believe in something?
Something...

543
00:45:39,208 --> 00:45:40,308
bigger than you?

544
00:45:42,878 --> 00:45:45,178
Our... Our beliefs
don't make us better people.

545
00:45:46,148 --> 00:45:48,148
Our actions make us better people.

546
00:45:50,786 --> 00:45:53,264
So, Billy says you have
orderly experience.

547
00:45:53,288 --> 00:45:54,488
That's right.

548
00:45:54,991 --> 00:45:56,034
You working right now?

549
00:45:56,558 --> 00:45:58,343
A few shifts at Teenytown.

550
00:45:58,645 --> 00:45:59,738
Helping with the train.

551
00:46:00,061 --> 00:46:03,161
Because I do three days a week
at Rivington House, the hospice.

552
00:46:03,498 --> 00:46:05,298
Good orderly is tough to find.

553
00:46:05,802 --> 00:46:06,802
Tougher to keep.

554
00:46:08,371 --> 00:46:09,871
Do dying people bother you?

555
00:46:10,372 --> 00:46:11,372
No.

556
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,640
We're all dying.

557
00:46:13,942 --> 00:46:16,842
The world is one big hospice
with fresh air.

558
00:47:06,529 --> 00:47:07,329
Well...

559
00:47:08,731 --> 00:47:09,931
Well hi there.

560
00:47:12,134 --> 00:47:12,987
How long was I...

561
00:47:13,489 --> 00:47:14,689
Few days.

562
00:47:16,339 --> 00:47:17,739
You said it didn't hurt.

563
00:47:20,275 --> 00:47:21,475
Doesn't now, does it?

564
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:24,479
Felt like I was dying.

565
00:47:26,181 --> 00:47:27,181
I know.

566
00:47:27,549 --> 00:47:28,549
You did.

567
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:32,520
You brought me back.

568
00:47:32,755 --> 00:47:34,155
You'll feel better when you eat.

569
00:47:34,924 --> 00:47:36,124
Am I still human?

570
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,827
Do you care?

571
00:47:59,382 --> 00:48:00,517
There you go.

572
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,720
What is it?

573
00:48:07,956 --> 00:48:09,456
You're scared of me.

574
00:48:14,029 --> 00:48:16,829
We love you more than anything
in the world.

575
00:48:19,067 --> 00:48:20,067
You hear me?

576
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,503
Anything.

577
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:26,442
Goodnight, my heart.

578
00:49:10,152 --> 00:49:13,056
Hey. Let him be.

579
00:49:14,723 --> 00:49:16,392
Azreel, leave him be.

580
00:49:27,002 --> 00:49:28,004
Azzie?

581
00:49:29,572 --> 00:49:30,807
Azzie, come on.

582
00:49:32,107 --> 00:49:34,307
Come on. Azzie.

583
00:49:34,543 --> 00:49:35,543
Doc.

584
00:49:36,779 --> 00:49:38,079
That you, Doc?

585
00:49:39,047 --> 00:49:40,391
No, I'm not a doctor.

586
00:49:40,415 --> 00:49:42,561
Do you want me to get you a doctor?

587
00:49:42,585 --> 00:49:44,195
The cat's on my bed.

588
00:49:44,219 --> 00:49:45,664
Oh, hey, I'll move her.

589
00:49:45,688 --> 00:49:46,688
No.

590
00:49:47,288 --> 00:49:48,688
I knew she would be.

591
00:49:49,458 --> 00:49:50,635
That cat,

592
00:49:51,737 --> 00:49:53,237
always seems to know...

593
00:49:55,464 --> 00:49:56,864
when it's time.

594
00:49:58,734 --> 00:49:59,926
I guess it's time.

595
00:50:00,128 --> 00:50:01,128
No.

596
00:50:01,404 --> 00:50:03,504
It's just Azzie being a silly old cat.

597
00:50:04,139 --> 00:50:05,139
Nope.

598
00:50:06,275 --> 00:50:08,275
Been that way ever since I got here.

599
00:50:09,744 --> 00:50:11,144
The cat knows...

600
00:50:11,746 --> 00:50:13,446
when it's time to go to sleep.

601
00:50:14,215 --> 00:50:15,615
Everybody knows that.

602
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:19,019
I'm gonna die.

603
00:50:30,433 --> 00:50:31,433
Yes.

604
00:50:32,634 --> 00:50:33,711
Let me get you someone.

605
00:50:33,735 --> 00:50:34,735
No.

606
00:50:36,739 --> 00:50:38,939
Known it was coming.

607
00:50:41,643 --> 00:50:43,443
Doesn't make it less scary.

608
00:50:44,112 --> 00:50:45,112
Yeah.

609
00:50:45,547 --> 00:50:47,347
But maybe it's just like you say,

610
00:50:47,782 --> 00:50:49,282
just going to sleep.

611
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:53,619
I mean, there is nothing scary.
It's just sleeping.

612
00:50:54,322 --> 00:50:56,422
You're a strange type of doctor.

613
00:50:56,725 --> 00:50:58,503
I told you, I'm not a doctor.

614
00:50:58,527 --> 00:50:59,727
Oh, I think you are.

615
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:02,530
Doctor Sleep.

616
00:51:03,331 --> 00:51:06,644
Doc, I am so scared
it's gonna hurt, or be dark,

617
00:51:06,968 --> 00:51:09,267
or... or be nothing at all.

618
00:51:09,269 --> 00:51:10,269
And I don't wanna...

619
00:51:10,269 --> 00:51:11,669
<i>Nothing to be scared of.</i>

620
00:51:12,842 --> 00:51:14,242
<i>Just going to sleep.</i>

621
00:51:15,877 --> 00:51:20,549
<i>Finally, true, restful, sleep.</i>

622
00:51:24,552 --> 00:51:25,752
Oh, thank you.

623
00:51:27,456 --> 00:51:28,656
Thank you, Doc.

624
00:51:30,793 --> 00:51:32,567
Look, I shouldn't be here.

625
00:51:32,569 --> 00:51:33,506
Let me go get you some...

626
00:51:33,529 --> 00:51:34,773
No, no, no.

627
00:51:34,797 --> 00:51:38,197
You're exactly, where you should be.

628
00:51:40,902 --> 00:51:42,002
Exactly.

629
00:51:46,842 --> 00:51:48,342
I see my wife.

630
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:15,525
Dan, alcoholic.

631
00:54:16,391 --> 00:54:17,391
Hi, Dan.

632
00:54:17,759 --> 00:54:19,059
I'm not much of a speech guy.

633
00:54:20,095 --> 00:54:21,498
I just thought I'd hold the chip and...

634
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,600
talk about whatever popped up.

635
00:54:26,335 --> 00:54:27,335
So, here I am.

636
00:54:31,739 --> 00:54:33,339
And I'm thinking about my dad.

637
00:54:36,078 --> 00:54:38,178
I saw a chip like this in his hand once.

638
00:54:39,081 --> 00:54:40,781
A couple months before he died.

639
00:54:41,083 --> 00:54:42,883
Five month chip, I'm pretty sure.

640
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:50,090
He hurt me once
when he was drunk.

641
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:52,360
Broke my arm.

642
00:54:53,661 --> 00:54:55,061
Then he dried right out.

643
00:54:58,801 --> 00:55:02,101
He died when I was five, so
the only way I got to know him,

644
00:55:02,271 --> 00:55:03,004
really...

645
00:55:03,806 --> 00:55:04,992
got to know him was...

646
00:55:05,194 --> 00:55:07,922
when I went dark.
When I... When I drank...

647
00:55:08,624 --> 00:55:10,124
to... to dull the...

648
00:55:11,112 --> 00:55:12,112
or...

649
00:55:13,415 --> 00:55:15,215
whenever I wanted
to break someone's face,

650
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:16,570
because the...

651
00:55:17,372 --> 00:55:19,572
drinking and the temper
and the anger,

652
00:55:20,656 --> 00:55:22,256
those things in me were his.

653
00:55:22,458 --> 00:55:24,058
And they were all I could know of him.

654
00:55:27,128 --> 00:55:28,261
But now...

655
00:55:28,563 --> 00:55:31,463
well now I get to know him
a little different because...

656
00:55:32,835 --> 00:55:34,835
he also stood in a room
like this once...

657
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,700
wanting to get well...

658
00:55:37,794 --> 00:55:38,715
for me...

659
00:55:39,217 --> 00:55:40,517
and my mom.

660
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:44,710
And he held the chip in his hand...

661
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,880
and the chip said five months,

662
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:48,675
and, and on that day...

663
00:55:48,777 --> 00:55:49,577
he...

664
00:55:50,052 --> 00:55:51,252
before it all...

665
00:55:53,956 --> 00:55:55,967
Well on that day
all he wanted in the world

666
00:55:55,968 --> 00:55:57,768
was to stand where I'm standing now.

667
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:00,660
And here I am so...

668
00:56:02,897 --> 00:56:04,597
so thank you for us both,

669
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:05,653
I guess.

670
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,300
This is for Jack Torrance.

671
00:56:27,956 --> 00:56:29,056
Hey, Charlie.

672
00:56:32,094 --> 00:56:33,094
Doc?

673
00:56:36,098 --> 00:56:37,881
Guess I don't need to ask...

674
00:56:38,183 --> 00:56:39,490
why you're here...

675
00:56:39,992 --> 00:56:41,292
at this hour.

676
00:56:43,871 --> 00:56:45,171
Do you have pain?

677
00:56:45,873 --> 00:56:47,973
Do you want me to get Claudette
to bring you a pill?

678
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:50,800
Pill won't matter.

679
00:56:52,781 --> 00:56:54,281
I heard about these...

680
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:55,910
house calls.

681
00:56:57,185 --> 00:56:58,461
What a visit from,

682
00:56:58,863 --> 00:57:00,090
Doctor Sleep,

683
00:57:00,692 --> 00:57:02,092
really is.

684
00:57:04,927 --> 00:57:06,527
So, what do you see Doc?

685
00:57:14,770 --> 00:57:16,370
I see your twin sons.

686
00:57:17,505 --> 00:57:18,705
Four years old.

687
00:57:19,641 --> 00:57:20,909
Can you see them?

688
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:22,900
I do.

689
00:57:24,345 --> 00:57:25,745
Farmall tractor.

690
00:57:26,815 --> 00:57:28,915
A striped umbrella over the seat.

691
00:57:30,018 --> 00:57:31,318
Five years old,

692
00:57:32,621 --> 00:57:34,021
pulling a red wagon.

693
00:57:36,958 --> 00:57:39,658
Lord, look at that.

694
00:57:40,496 --> 00:57:41,896
Like a deck of cards.

695
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:43,930
All out of order.

696
00:57:46,034 --> 00:57:49,634
I'm not scared of hell, Doc.

697
00:57:52,172 --> 00:57:53,148
I lived a...

698
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:54,493
decent...

699
00:57:54,995 --> 00:57:55,995
life.

700
00:57:56,811 --> 00:57:59,311
I don't think there is
such a place anyway.

701
00:58:00,047 --> 00:58:01,547
I guess I'm scared...

702
00:58:03,652 --> 00:58:04,852
there is nothing.

703
00:58:07,188 --> 00:58:08,888
There was nothing before.

704
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,531
So, what if there is...

705
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,662
nothing...

706
00:58:15,564 --> 00:58:16,564
after?

707
00:58:18,232 --> 00:58:19,932
We don't end, Charlie.

708
00:58:21,203 --> 00:58:22,703
I know that for certain.

709
00:58:23,572 --> 00:58:24,872
I don't know much else but...

710
00:58:26,708 --> 00:58:28,108
I know that we don't end.

711
00:58:33,349 --> 00:58:34,449
Blueberries.

712
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:37,407
I can taste blueberries,

713
00:58:37,909 --> 00:58:39,609
my mother used to grow.

714
00:58:40,989 --> 00:58:42,289
Can you taste them?

715
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:43,790
Yeah, I can.

716
00:58:46,661 --> 00:58:48,861
And I can hear Frank on your old radio.

717
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:52,100
The one you used to have on
your workbench next to your tools.

718
00:58:54,002 --> 00:58:55,702

726
00:59:27,636 --> 00:59:29,236
Been a minute, little pen pal.

727
00:59:44,917 --> 00:59:45,881
Abra?

728
00:59:46,283 --> 00:59:47,056
School.

729
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:49,590
Fine, I know.

730
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,100
Hey Gramps, you seen Rosie?

731
01:00:10,779 --> 01:00:12,279
Watchtower.

732
01:00:14,782 --> 01:00:15,982
You feeling ok?

733
01:00:16,817 --> 01:00:18,017
Peachy keen.

734
01:00:37,072 --> 01:00:38,072
Hey.

735
01:00:40,074 --> 01:00:41,474
Sorry to interrupt.

736
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:42,910
Any luck?

737
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:44,900
Getting closer.

738
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:47,780
He's somewhere in Iowa,
I think.

739
01:00:48,917 --> 01:00:52,217
We'll all take a nice long road
trip once I'm sure I've found him.

740
01:00:55,356 --> 01:00:56,756
Until I do, we...

741
01:00:57,759 --> 01:00:59,759
You gotta open a canister, Rosie.

742
01:01:00,328 --> 01:01:03,628
We took steam six months ago,
Crow. Six months is nothing.

743
01:01:04,331 --> 01:01:07,631
That kid in Delaware wasn't so
steamy and it's already showing.

744
01:01:08,436 --> 01:01:10,213
You see Grampa Flick's hair, yeah?

745
01:01:10,237 --> 01:01:11,237
Yeah.

746
01:01:11,706 --> 01:01:12,906
I don't think he's well.

747
01:01:13,275 --> 01:01:15,987
Grampa Flick hasn't been well
since Nixon was in office.

748
01:01:16,011 --> 01:01:17,411
I know, but...

749
01:01:18,279 --> 01:01:19,463
we need to eat.

750
01:01:19,865 --> 01:01:20,965
All of us.

751
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:24,150
Are the canisters low?

752
01:01:24,519 --> 01:01:25,719
Of course not.

753
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:29,120
Just no need to waste one
if you're close to the kill.

754
01:01:31,159 --> 01:01:32,159
Rosie.

755
01:01:32,761 --> 01:01:34,561
I might need it just to find him.

756
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,400
There used to be more steam
in the world, you know?

757
01:01:40,401 --> 01:01:42,001
Oh, don't be daft. Come on.

758
01:01:42,337 --> 01:01:46,337
That's like when rubes say, 50 years ago,
people used to be more neighborly.

759
01:01:46,407 --> 01:01:47,607
But it's true, Rosie.

760
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:49,808
There's less steam out there,
and it's weaker too.

761
01:01:50,277 --> 01:01:51,551
I don't know if it's their cell phones

762
01:01:51,553 --> 01:01:53,353
or diets, or their Netflix or what,

763
01:01:53,354 --> 01:01:55,654
but I am not picking up
many scents these days,

764
01:01:55,655 --> 01:01:57,394
and the ones that I do Rosie,
are just not that...

765
01:01:57,418 --> 01:01:59,831
I'll open a canister tonight
to tide everyone over.

766
01:01:59,832 --> 01:02:00,832
Thank you.

767
01:02:07,362 --> 01:02:08,610
You know it, Rosie.

768
01:02:08,712 --> 01:02:09,712
I know what?

769
01:02:09,713 --> 01:02:11,013
It's why you're up here every day.

770
01:02:11,114 --> 01:02:13,614
It's why you're always up here,
no matter what you tell the others.

771
01:02:14,702 --> 01:02:16,302
The world's not as steamy

772
01:02:16,337 --> 01:02:18,237
and you are looking for a whale.

773
01:03:07,087 --> 01:03:09,087
Oh, watch this kid.
Number 19.

774
01:03:09,558 --> 01:03:11,158
That kid is a natural.

775
01:03:11,458 --> 01:03:13,403
He hits the ball every time.

776
01:03:13,527 --> 01:03:15,227
Like he can read the pitcher's mind.

777
01:03:15,831 --> 01:03:17,131
Is that right?

778
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:27,084
See? You watch,

779
01:03:27,086 --> 01:03:28,480
one of these days,
one of those talent scouts

780
01:03:28,543 --> 01:03:31,243
is gonna get wind of Brad there.
You watch.

781
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,200
Hey, 19,

782
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:57,300
just saw your game.

783
01:03:58,373 --> 01:04:00,173
You are ready for the majors.

784
01:04:00,407 --> 01:04:01,507
Well played.

785
01:04:01,511 --> 01:04:02,321
Thanks.

786
01:04:02,322 --> 01:04:03,422
Hey, you heading home?

787
01:04:04,145 --> 01:04:06,045
You wanna hop in?
I'll give you a ride.

788
01:04:07,415 --> 01:04:08,715
No, it's real close.

789
01:04:09,551 --> 01:04:10,551
I'm good.

790
01:04:13,288 --> 01:04:14,488
It's ok.

791
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:15,951
We're friends.

792
01:04:16,253 --> 01:04:17,343
You wanna hop in.

793
01:04:17,348 --> 01:04:18,348
We'll take you right home.

794
01:04:19,261 --> 01:04:20,761
You can take me right home.

795
01:04:21,863 --> 01:04:23,063
You trust me.

796
01:04:24,099 --> 01:04:25,199
I trust you.

797
01:05:00,601 --> 01:05:02,601
No! No, please! No!

798
01:05:02,602 --> 01:05:03,602
No!

799
01:05:14,516 --> 01:05:15,278
No!

800
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,627
Please let me go.

801
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:18,308
Please, I won't tell. Please.

802
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:19,810
Please!

803
01:05:22,956 --> 01:05:24,536
Number 19.

804
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,260
Kid, you were good.

805
01:05:27,261 --> 01:05:28,761
No!

806
01:05:34,168 --> 01:05:35,568
No, please let me go.

807
01:05:36,538 --> 01:05:39,038
I won't tell.
I won't tell. Please.

808
01:05:39,674 --> 01:05:40,774
It's ok.

809
01:05:41,109 --> 01:05:42,109
Please.

810
01:05:50,685 --> 01:05:52,453
Are you gonna hurt me?

811
01:05:53,121 --> 01:05:54,197
Yes.

812
01:05:54,221 --> 01:05:55,621
No!

813
01:05:57,424 --> 01:05:59,524
Pain purifies steam.

814
01:05:59,761 --> 01:06:03,232
Fear, too, so, you understand.

815
01:06:50,344 --> 01:06:51,344
Stop!

816
01:07:03,456 --> 01:07:04,356
Stop.

817
01:07:05,126 --> 01:07:05,826
Stop.

818
01:07:06,728 --> 01:07:07,528
Stop!

819
01:07:09,797 --> 01:07:10,797
<i>Stop, monster.</i>

820
01:07:18,505 --> 01:07:20,005
<i>Stop. Stop.</i>

821
01:07:20,975 --> 01:07:21,975
What is it?

822
01:07:40,627 --> 01:07:42,227
Abra! Abra!
Hey, hey, hey!

823
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:44,675
Sweetie. Sweetheart, wake up.
Wake up, sweetheart.

824
01:07:44,699 --> 01:07:45,842
Abra, wake up!
Hey, hey, hey.

825
01:07:45,866 --> 01:07:47,168
Abra! Abra!
Stop it!

826
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:57,543
Jesus.

827
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:43,690
Ok.

828
01:08:44,825 --> 01:08:45,825
Ok.

829
01:08:47,361 --> 01:08:48,361
Ok.

830
01:09:36,843 --> 01:09:39,143
Damn. I thought he had another
few minutes in him.

831
01:09:43,651 --> 01:09:44,651
Ok, ready?

832
01:09:58,766 --> 01:10:00,366
They killed him.

833
01:10:01,401 --> 01:10:03,001
They killed him.

834
01:10:07,976 --> 01:10:09,376
It's ok.

835
01:10:36,504 --> 01:10:37,604
We had a looker.

836
01:10:42,677 --> 01:10:43,677
Tonight?

837
01:10:45,545 --> 01:10:46,545
Yeah.

838
01:10:47,481 --> 01:10:48,581
Big steam?

839
01:10:49,717 --> 01:10:51,217
Oh, honey, it was huge.

840
01:10:53,387 --> 01:10:54,387
Where?

841
01:10:54,688 --> 01:10:57,288
East Coast, I think.

842
01:10:59,694 --> 01:11:03,694
You're saying someone looked in
from 1,500 miles away?

843
01:11:05,333 --> 01:11:06,433
Maybe further.

844
01:11:08,736 --> 01:11:09,836
Boy or girl?

845
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:11,400
Girl, I think.

846
01:11:12,039 --> 01:11:13,839
She was out of there so fast.

847
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:16,900
But I swear, Crow Daddy,

848
01:11:18,346 --> 01:11:20,446
I haven't felt power like that,

849
01:11:21,883 --> 01:11:23,983
raw power like that, in...

850
01:11:25,419 --> 01:11:26,519
so long.

851
01:11:28,021 --> 01:11:29,721
Then we need to look into it.

852
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:31,369
Sooner the better.

853
01:11:31,371 --> 01:11:32,171
Yeah.

854
01:11:32,172 --> 01:11:33,872
Case her parents freak out,

855
01:11:34,027 --> 01:11:35,927
send her to a psychiatrist.

856
01:11:36,597 --> 01:11:37,994
They get her on pills,

857
01:11:38,096 --> 01:11:39,496
could ruin the steam.

858
01:11:39,767 --> 01:11:42,467
Might muffle her just...
No, giving Paxil to this kid,

859
01:11:42,468 --> 01:11:43,261
it's like,

860
01:11:43,363 --> 01:11:45,963
throwing a piece of Saran Wrap
over a searchlight.

861
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:47,500
I don't know where she is,

862
01:11:48,276 --> 01:11:50,676
but when she comes back,
and she'll be back,

863
01:11:52,547 --> 01:11:53,947
oh, I'll be ready, honey.

864
01:11:57,051 --> 01:11:58,251
I'll be ready.

865
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:00,479
Morning.

866
01:13:01,249 --> 01:13:02,049
Morning.

867
01:13:04,084 --> 01:13:05,084
Guess what.

868
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:06,700
I made a new friend.

869
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,500
His name's Dan.

870
01:13:09,123 --> 01:13:09,844
Yeah?

871
01:13:10,246 --> 01:13:11,246
At school?

872
01:13:12,026 --> 01:13:13,826
No. He doesn't live here.

873
01:13:14,161 --> 01:13:15,661
I mean, he lives close.

874
01:13:16,062 --> 01:13:17,262
Frazier, I think.

875
01:13:17,531 --> 01:13:18,531
No big deal.

876
01:13:18,965 --> 01:13:20,165
Abs, are you ok?

877
01:13:21,102 --> 01:13:22,102
Last night I...

878
01:13:22,370 --> 01:13:23,370
I'm ok.

879
01:13:24,605 --> 01:13:25,705
Sorry about that.

880
01:13:25,706 --> 01:13:28,406
I know that head of yours
is like a radio sometimes.

881
01:13:29,244 --> 01:13:30,072
And...

882
01:13:30,474 --> 01:13:31,812
you pick up some...

883
01:13:32,214 --> 01:13:33,414
weird stations.

884
01:13:33,481 --> 01:13:34,581
Nothing weird like that.

885
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:36,783
Not anymore.

886
01:13:46,494 --> 01:13:47,494
<i>My God.</i>

887
01:13:47,595 --> 01:13:50,073
<i>I've gotta study.
If I don't study...</i>

888
01:13:50,597 --> 01:13:53,510
<i>Running play.
Hand-off to 11 and...</i>

889
01:13:54,134 --> 01:13:56,137
<i>Coach is gonna kill me
if I don't get these.</i>

890
01:13:57,637 --> 01:13:59,137
<i>Why doesn't he like me?</i>

891
01:13:59,673 --> 01:14:01,585
<i>My hair?
I should change my hair.</i>

892
01:14:01,609 --> 01:14:03,153
<i>The freak is staring at me again.</i>

893
01:14:03,177 --> 01:14:04,677
<i>What is she staring at?</i>

894
01:14:05,045 --> 01:14:05,945
<i>Freak.</i>

895
01:14:45,820 --> 01:14:46,820
Hey, Abba-doo.

896
01:14:47,021 --> 01:14:48,021
Hey, Dad.

897
01:14:48,222 --> 01:14:49,222
School ok?

898
01:14:50,558 --> 01:14:51,758
How's the book?

899
01:14:52,192 --> 01:14:54,092
Good. Yeah, going good...

900
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,206
I'm writing about
Charleston and Black Bottom.

901
01:14:56,230 --> 01:14:57,430
Yeah, it's...

902
01:14:57,431 --> 01:14:58,307
It's feeling like...

903
01:14:58,309 --> 01:15:00,709
I'm going to start my homework.

904
01:15:00,801 --> 01:15:02,418
Ok. Good.

905
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:04,020
That's good, sweetie.

906
01:15:04,571 --> 01:15:06,071
Think Harvard in three years.

907
01:15:06,706 --> 01:15:07,906
We'll see.

908
01:15:07,941 --> 01:15:09,541
Yeah. We will see.

909
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:47,659
Well, hi there.

910
01:18:55,802 --> 01:18:56,802
Get out!

911
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:00,107
Get out! Get out of my head!

912
01:19:02,008 --> 01:19:03,110
Get out!

913
01:19:12,153 --> 01:19:14,853
Ma'am, are you ok?
No! No.

914
01:19:15,356 --> 01:19:16,756
Yeah, I'm fine.

915
01:19:18,225 --> 01:19:19,325
I'm fine.

916
01:19:26,467 --> 01:19:27,767
Jesus.

917
01:19:29,169 --> 01:19:30,269
Danno?

918
01:19:31,070 --> 01:19:32,282
Dan?
Dan?

919
01:19:32,805 --> 01:19:34,205
Get up. Stand up, Dan.

920
01:19:34,809 --> 01:19:35,809
Come on, Danno.

921
01:19:37,812 --> 01:19:39,312
What happened?
Well, you just dropped.

922
01:19:40,114 --> 01:19:41,514
Thought you was having a stroke.

923
01:19:42,062 --> 01:19:43,062
Who's Tony?

924
01:19:44,317 --> 01:19:45,317
What?

925
01:19:45,419 --> 01:19:46,979
You kept saying, please help me, Tony.

926
01:19:50,456 --> 01:19:51,856
Well, I'm sorry about that.

927
01:20:12,445 --> 01:20:13,445
Rosie?

928
01:20:25,693 --> 01:20:26,870
We've got a problem.

929
01:20:27,094 --> 01:20:28,594
Talk to me.
The looker?

930
01:20:29,429 --> 01:20:30,729
Yeah, she found me again.

931
01:20:31,565 --> 01:20:33,076
How?
I don't know.

932
01:20:33,077 --> 01:20:34,077
I don't care.

933
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:35,759
We have to have her, Crow.

934
01:20:36,261 --> 01:20:37,261
We have to.

935
01:20:38,105 --> 01:20:39,334
Does she know who you are?

936
01:20:39,836 --> 01:20:40,643
Where we are?
No.

937
01:20:40,645 --> 01:20:41,952
I don't know. I don't.
I don't think.

938
01:20:41,954 --> 01:20:43,254
That's not the important. Look.

939
01:20:44,445 --> 01:20:46,545
I said she's huge steam, right?

940
01:20:46,813 --> 01:20:48,413
Yeah, it's even bigger than that.

941
01:20:49,316 --> 01:20:50,816
I tried to turn around in her and,

942
01:20:50,817 --> 01:20:53,817
she blew me out of her
like I was nothing.

943
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:54,720
Bullshit.
No.

944
01:20:54,721 --> 01:20:56,221
Never happened to me, ever.

945
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,700
I would have said that was impossible.

946
01:21:00,593 --> 01:21:02,393
Is she food or do we turn her?

947
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,244
We don't turn her.

948
01:21:05,298 --> 01:21:06,798
Rosie, are you sure?

949
01:21:06,901 --> 01:21:08,377
If she's what you say she is, then...

950
01:21:08,401 --> 01:21:10,701
Then we don't want anyone
with that power in the Knot.

951
01:21:11,437 --> 01:21:12,837
Jeez. Think about it.

952
01:21:20,420 --> 01:21:21,820
What if she's neither?

953
01:21:22,615 --> 01:21:23,715
What do you mean?

954
01:21:23,950 --> 01:21:25,750
I mean, we don't kill her.

955
01:21:26,453 --> 01:21:27,853
And we don't turn her.

956
01:21:29,589 --> 01:21:30,589
Think of a cow.

957
01:21:30,790 --> 01:21:32,620
You butcher one, that gives you meat for...

958
01:21:33,222 --> 01:21:34,222
a month.

959
01:21:35,361 --> 01:21:36,561
Keep it alive,

960
01:21:38,097 --> 01:21:39,397
take care of it,

961
01:21:40,334 --> 01:21:42,434
it gives you milk for years.

962
01:21:43,203 --> 01:21:45,203
Rosie, we've never tried that.
I know.

963
01:21:45,306 --> 01:21:47,283
Because a steam head is dangerous.

964
01:21:47,307 --> 01:21:48,984
You keep it alive, it could be dangerous.

965
01:21:49,008 --> 01:21:50,208
I know. The point...

966
01:21:51,578 --> 01:21:52,678
The point Crow is...

967
01:21:54,181 --> 01:21:56,181
she is the great white whale.

968
01:21:57,351 --> 01:21:58,551
And I want her.

969
01:22:00,654 --> 01:22:02,054
I want her.

970
01:22:03,624 --> 01:22:05,424
I fucking want her.

971
01:22:16,536 --> 01:22:17,636
Have a great day.

972
01:22:17,805 --> 01:22:18,805
You too.

973
01:23:46,493 --> 01:23:47,493
<i>Hi.</i>

974
01:23:58,371 --> 01:23:59,371
Billy.

975
01:24:17,857 --> 01:24:19,357
<i>You can hear me.</i>

976
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:21,560
Let's use our outside voices, alright?

977
01:24:23,429 --> 01:24:24,829
You tracked me down?

978
01:24:24,931 --> 01:24:26,054
It was easier than I thought.

979
01:24:26,456 --> 01:24:28,256
Like GPS, but in my head.

980
01:24:29,837 --> 01:24:31,717
Look, I don't mean any offense but...

981
01:24:32,619 --> 01:24:33,719
this day and age...

982
01:24:34,064 --> 01:24:36,864
a grown man sitting with
a teenage girl on a park bench...

983
01:24:36,865 --> 01:24:38,147
I'm Abra Stone.

984
01:24:38,149 --> 01:24:39,789
And if anyone asks, you're my uncle.

985
01:24:40,012 --> 01:24:41,012
Uncle Dan.

986
01:24:43,816 --> 01:24:45,330
And that's not even a lie.

987
01:24:45,332 --> 01:24:46,632
Not totally.

988
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:48,920
We're related in other ways.

989
01:24:49,455 --> 01:24:51,155
You're magic, like me.

990
01:24:52,825 --> 01:24:54,225
I don't know about magic.

991
01:24:55,628 --> 01:24:56,628
I...

992
01:24:57,330 --> 01:24:58,841
I always called it the shining.

993
01:24:58,965 --> 01:25:00,665
And, yeah, we both shine.

994
01:25:01,802 --> 01:25:03,102
Do your parents know?

995
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:04,600
About my shine?

996
01:25:06,572 --> 01:25:07,872
They're scared of it but,

997
01:25:07,907 --> 01:25:10,407
they think it's gone
except for a few things, like...

998
01:25:10,511 --> 01:25:13,411
My mom sometimes asks me to
help her find something she's lost.

999
01:25:13,914 --> 01:25:15,614
Last month, it was her car keys.

1000
01:25:15,816 --> 01:25:17,816
She left them on my dad's
worktable in the garage.

1001
01:25:18,651 --> 01:25:20,051
But they don't talk about it.

1002
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:22,499
Or if I use it...

1003
01:25:22,501 --> 01:25:23,801
they look at me different.

1004
01:25:24,530 --> 01:25:25,730
Or not at all.

1005
01:25:26,325 --> 01:25:27,925
Not for a whole day once.

1006
01:25:28,794 --> 01:25:30,294
Wouldn't look me in the eyes.

1007
01:25:32,833 --> 01:25:34,333
So, I try not to use it.

1008
01:25:34,869 --> 01:25:36,269
Because if people find out,

1009
01:25:37,103 --> 01:25:38,539
Eek, a freak. You know?

1010
01:25:40,673 --> 01:25:41,873
Sure you know.

1011
01:25:42,476 --> 01:25:44,176
You try not to use it, too.

1012
01:25:46,512 --> 01:25:48,212
You've been trying a long time,

1013
01:25:49,549 --> 01:25:52,149
and she couldn't look you
in your eyes either.

1014
01:25:56,923 --> 01:25:59,418
When I was a kid,
I didn't understand the shining.

1015
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:00,720
I called it, Tony.

1016
01:26:01,428 --> 01:26:03,328
I thought he was
my imaginary friend.

1017
01:26:03,763 --> 01:26:05,963
I thought you were
my imaginary friend...

1018
01:26:06,833 --> 01:26:08,233
for a long time.

1019
01:26:10,270 --> 01:26:11,770
How many of us are out there?

1020
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:15,717
There's a lot of people
who have a little bit of shine,

1021
01:26:15,741 --> 01:26:16,941
they don't even know it.

1022
01:26:17,377 --> 01:26:19,777
They always seem to come home
with flowers when their wives are sad,

1023
01:26:19,778 --> 01:26:22,578
or they do well on the school
test they didn't study for.

1024
01:26:22,848 --> 01:26:24,598
But I only met two or three people

1025
01:26:24,599 --> 01:26:26,799
in my whole life
who knew they shined.

1026
01:26:29,422 --> 01:26:30,922
The baseball boy shined.

1027
01:26:31,657 --> 01:26:33,157
His name was Bradley Trevor.

1028
01:26:36,730 --> 01:26:37,830
These people...

1029
01:26:38,898 --> 01:26:40,661
they look like people anyway,

1030
01:26:40,663 --> 01:26:41,663
they took him.

1031
01:26:42,768 --> 01:26:43,968
And they ate him.

1032
01:26:45,905 --> 01:26:47,405
They ate his shine.

1033
01:26:48,574 --> 01:26:49,774
You could feel it?

1034
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:52,148
And they could feel me,

1035
01:26:52,650 --> 01:26:53,650
I think.

1036
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:55,101
At least one of them did.

1037
01:26:55,116 --> 01:26:56,116
A lady.

1038
01:26:57,683 --> 01:26:59,083
The lady with the hat.

1039
01:27:00,687 --> 01:27:01,887
I wanna find them,

1040
01:27:02,267 --> 01:27:03,467
stop them,

1041
01:27:03,889 --> 01:27:06,489
because I think they've done
this to a lot of other kids, too.

1042
01:27:07,928 --> 01:27:09,408
So, I have to do something,

1043
01:27:09,610 --> 01:27:10,565
right?

1044
01:27:11,330 --> 01:27:12,930
Why did you come here?

1045
01:27:13,532 --> 01:27:14,632
Why me?

1046
01:27:14,968 --> 01:27:16,268
Because you can hear me.

1047
01:27:16,703 --> 01:27:18,903
You'd believe me.
You shine, too.

1048
01:27:19,472 --> 01:27:21,072
And they hurt people like us.

1049
01:27:23,470 --> 01:27:24,906
I mean, what would you do?

1050
01:27:28,114 --> 01:27:29,426
If you could get something of his,

1051
01:27:29,650 --> 01:27:30,760
if you could go to Iowa...

1052
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,730
Hang on.
I can help you find him.

1053
01:27:32,785 --> 01:27:34,385
Then his parents would know
where he was.

1054
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:36,120
They could bury him right, at least.

1055
01:27:36,623 --> 01:27:38,023
We could also get his glove.

1056
01:27:38,558 --> 01:27:40,525
If I can touch that glove,
I can track them.

1057
01:27:40,526 --> 01:27:41,326
Easy. Easy.

1058
01:27:41,327 --> 01:27:42,627
Because Barry the Chunk,

1059
01:27:42,757 --> 01:27:44,257
I think that was his name,

1060
01:27:44,630 --> 01:27:46,530
for a while, before they killed him,

1061
01:27:46,799 --> 01:27:48,199
he was wearing it.

1062
01:28:00,012 --> 01:28:00,918
Abra,

1063
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:02,620
go home.

1064
01:28:02,848 --> 01:28:05,348
Think about your school.
Think about your parents.

1065
01:28:05,785 --> 01:28:07,753
Think about the rest of your life.
Don't...

1066
01:28:07,955 --> 01:28:09,355
Don't chase these people.

1067
01:28:09,889 --> 01:28:11,289
Don't aggravate them.

1068
01:28:11,825 --> 01:28:14,125
And whatever you do,
don't attract their attention.

1069
01:28:14,895 --> 01:28:15,995
Don't shine.

1070
01:28:16,730 --> 01:28:18,723
Find something, anything.
Well...

1071
01:28:19,225 --> 01:28:21,725
almost anything to stop
that shine of yours.

1072
01:28:22,401 --> 01:28:24,322
Keep your head down,
keep your shine down,

1073
01:28:24,324 --> 01:28:27,124
hope to God that these people
or anything like them they...

1074
01:28:27,740 --> 01:28:29,340
they don't see you.

1075
01:28:30,677 --> 01:28:32,077
If they see you, they come back.

1076
01:28:33,379 --> 01:28:34,479
Abra, do you hear me?

1077
01:28:35,681 --> 01:28:37,081
They come back.

1078
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:42,000
Keep your head down.
Stay safe.

1079
01:28:44,258 --> 01:28:45,258
I'm sorry.

1080
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:08,080
What is it?

1081
01:29:08,914 --> 01:29:10,114
Oh, it's nothing, Doc.

1082
01:29:11,418 --> 01:29:12,418
It's nothing.

1083
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:14,420
Thinking about Dad.

1084
01:29:18,057 --> 01:29:19,057
No, I'm not.

1085
01:29:20,627 --> 01:29:22,627
You are. And you don't want to.

1086
01:29:27,734 --> 01:29:29,034
Don't worry about me, Doc.

1087
01:29:30,070 --> 01:29:31,070
I'm fine.

1088
01:29:33,940 --> 01:29:35,040
We're fine.

1089
01:30:12,978 --> 01:30:14,078
Hey, Azzie.

1090
01:30:27,561 --> 01:30:29,561
You got your wires crossed tonight.

1091
01:30:31,497 --> 01:30:32,297
No that's...

1092
01:30:32,499 --> 01:30:33,899
That room's empty, Az.

1093
01:30:38,771 --> 01:30:40,071
There's no one in that room.

1094
01:30:50,114 --> 01:30:51,314
Hang on, Doc.

1095
01:30:52,552 --> 01:30:53,152
Dick.

1096
01:30:54,721 --> 01:30:55,921
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1097
01:30:56,655 --> 01:30:57,934
I... I... I thought it was...

1098
01:30:57,958 --> 01:30:59,458
Thought I was from the Overlook.

1099
01:30:59,892 --> 01:31:01,392
Almost locked me up.

1100
01:31:02,062 --> 01:31:04,162
Still getting visits from them old ghosts?

1101
01:31:04,763 --> 01:31:06,163
No, not for years.

1102
01:31:06,633 --> 01:31:09,533
Horace Derwent was the last one,
confetti on his suit.

1103
01:31:09,936 --> 01:31:11,936
Said, Great party, isn't it?

1104
01:31:11,972 --> 01:31:14,872
Shit-eating grin on his face
till I pulled out a box for him.

1105
01:31:15,275 --> 01:31:16,775
That grin went fast.

1106
01:31:18,078 --> 01:31:20,578
Hey, it never occurred to me
to ask you back then.

1107
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:22,550
What happens to them
in those boxes?

1108
01:31:22,551 --> 01:31:23,751
Do they die in there?

1109
01:31:24,049 --> 01:31:25,249
Do you care?

1110
01:31:29,688 --> 01:31:30,888
I missed you.

1111
01:31:30,923 --> 01:31:32,091
Has it been a long time?

1112
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:34,960
Can't tell.

1113
01:31:35,928 --> 01:31:38,828
This world is a dream
of a dream to me now.

1114
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:40,768
Eight years.

1115
01:31:40,770 --> 01:31:42,170
Little more.

1116
01:31:42,669 --> 01:31:44,169
Last time I saw you,

1117
01:31:44,737 --> 01:31:46,337
you was at the bottom.

1118
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:48,940
You look better now.

1119
01:31:49,776 --> 01:31:50,976
Why are you here?

1120
01:31:51,945 --> 01:31:54,145
I'm here because it all comes around.

1121
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:56,900
Ka's a wheel, Doc.

1122
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:00,600
You listen, son.

1123
01:32:00,954 --> 01:32:03,454
It hurts to be here,
so I'll only say it once.

1124
01:32:04,057 --> 01:32:05,725
These empty devils,

1125
01:32:06,127 --> 01:32:08,327
ever found you when you was a tyke,

1126
01:32:09,195 --> 01:32:10,795
if they'd even sniffed you,

1127
01:32:11,497 --> 01:32:12,997
you'd be long dead.

1128
01:32:13,667 --> 01:32:15,514
They're on the land like...

1129
01:32:15,516 --> 01:32:17,216
a cancer on the skin.

1130
01:32:18,637 --> 01:32:21,182
Once, they rode camels
in the desert.

1131
01:32:21,206 --> 01:32:24,506
Once, they drove caravans
across Eastern Europe.

1132
01:32:25,645 --> 01:32:27,545
They eat screams,

1133
01:32:28,013 --> 01:32:29,813
and drink pain,

1134
01:32:30,650 --> 01:32:33,286
and they've noticed that little girl.

1135
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:35,920
They might kill her,

1136
01:32:37,656 --> 01:32:38,856
might turn her,

1137
01:32:40,794 --> 01:32:43,672
or might keep her till she's all used up,

1138
01:32:43,696 --> 01:32:45,106
and that'd be worst of all.

1139
01:32:45,130 --> 01:32:46,930
You can't let them.

1140
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:50,700
Why me?

1141
01:32:51,338 --> 01:32:53,138
Because she found you.

1142
01:32:53,572 --> 01:32:56,472
Because she showed up.
Hell, Doc, why me?

1143
01:32:57,310 --> 01:32:59,810
You just walked on
into my kitchen one day,

1144
01:32:59,811 --> 01:33:01,189
and I'm still on the hook.

1145
01:33:01,213 --> 01:33:02,913
What the hell am I supposed to do?

1146
01:33:05,285 --> 01:33:07,385
Get her what she asked for.

1147
01:33:09,990 --> 01:33:11,790
You won't see me again, Doc.

1148
01:33:13,093 --> 01:33:14,793
This is my last dream.

1149
01:33:21,301 --> 01:33:24,401
It seems to me
you grew up fine, son,

1150
01:33:25,170 --> 01:33:26,770
but you still owe a debt.

1151
01:33:32,044 --> 01:33:33,044
Pay it.

1152
01:33:47,227 --> 01:33:48,927
God, damn it. What?

1153
01:33:52,132 --> 01:33:53,013
Hey.

1154
01:33:53,015 --> 01:33:54,011
Sorry to interrupt.

1155
01:33:54,012 --> 01:33:56,512
I told you, no distractions.
Didn't I?

1156
01:33:56,902 --> 01:33:58,847
Nothing to eat, nothing to drink.

1157
01:33:58,848 --> 01:34:01,648
Just peace, quiet and meditation.

1158
01:34:02,107 --> 01:34:05,507
I need all my wits
for her tonight, Crow.

1159
01:34:05,945 --> 01:34:08,045
That's why I'm here.
I found something.

1160
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:18,520
How small can an earthquake be?

1161
01:34:19,258 --> 01:34:21,958
Pretty small, if the people
of Richland Court,

1162
01:34:21,995 --> 01:34:25,995
a short Anniston street that dead-ends
at the Saco River, are to be believed.

1163
01:34:26,732 --> 01:34:28,176
Late Tuesday night,

1164
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:30,145
several residents of the street
reported a tremor

1165
01:34:30,169 --> 01:34:31,969
that rattled windows, shook floors,

1166
01:34:32,071 --> 01:34:35,371
and sent glassware tumbling
from the shelves.

1167
01:34:35,842 --> 01:34:39,042
Although the Geological Survey
Center in Wrentham...

1168
01:34:39,846 --> 01:34:42,846
reports there were no temblors
in New England last Tuesday.

1169
01:34:43,982 --> 01:34:45,182
What do you think?

1170
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:46,350
I think, maybe.

1171
01:34:47,253 --> 01:34:48,753
I'm not a hundred percent, but...

1172
01:34:49,089 --> 01:34:50,789
I'll take fifty-fifty.

1173
01:34:51,458 --> 01:34:52,708
If that's actually her...

1174
01:34:52,709 --> 01:34:54,327
Richland Court.
She did that,

1175
01:34:54,329 --> 01:34:55,829
shook a whole street in New Hampshire...

1176
01:34:55,830 --> 01:34:58,930
Having a place to actually focus
on, not just a town, but a street,

1177
01:34:59,199 --> 01:35:01,899
is gonna make things a hell of
a lot easier for me tonight.

1178
01:35:03,169 --> 01:35:04,169
Good catch.

1179
01:35:10,944 --> 01:35:12,044
How you coming at her?

1180
01:35:14,414 --> 01:35:15,714
Well, she'll be asleep.

1181
01:35:17,317 --> 01:35:18,971
I'll just wanna look around,

1182
01:35:19,273 --> 01:35:20,373
see if she is.

1183
01:35:21,387 --> 01:35:22,836
Plant some suggestions,

1184
01:35:22,838 --> 01:35:24,793
like little worms.

1185
01:35:25,892 --> 01:35:27,292
Let them burrow.

1186
01:35:28,460 --> 01:35:31,960
A hundred worms about
her dear friends, the Knot.

1187
01:35:33,499 --> 01:35:35,099
And when we roll up,

1188
01:35:35,968 --> 01:35:39,568
she'll be so happy to see us,
she'll just hop right in the van.

1189
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:45,400
If she did this...

1190
01:35:46,512 --> 01:35:48,312
really shook a whole street,

1191
01:35:49,214 --> 01:35:50,814
I think you should be careful.

1192
01:35:51,517 --> 01:35:52,917
She's a little girl.

1193
01:35:58,924 --> 01:36:01,224
And you are the queen bitch
of all time.

1194
01:36:01,326 --> 01:36:02,426
I know.

1195
01:36:03,228 --> 01:36:04,328
Just saying.

1196
01:36:05,464 --> 01:36:06,564
Be careful.

1197
01:36:32,292 --> 01:36:33,234
Hey.

1198
01:36:33,258 --> 01:36:34,235
Hey, Mom.

1199
01:36:34,259 --> 01:36:35,259
You feeling ok?

1200
01:36:35,495 --> 01:36:36,995
We missed you at dinner.

1201
01:36:37,931 --> 01:36:38,683
I'm ok.

1202
01:36:38,685 --> 01:36:40,485
Just had a rough day.

1203
01:36:45,338 --> 01:36:47,238
I'm flying out to see Momo
in the morning.

1204
01:36:48,141 --> 01:36:49,641
I'll be back as soon as I can.

1205
01:36:51,977 --> 01:36:53,077
Abs, is she...

1206
01:36:57,249 --> 01:36:58,886
Is she gonna pull through this time?

1207
01:37:03,423 --> 01:37:04,523
I don't know.

1208
01:37:06,092 --> 01:37:07,192
I hope so.

1209
01:37:08,328 --> 01:37:09,528
Tell her I love her.

1210
01:39:53,026 --> 01:39:55,226
Keep sleeping, princess.

1211
01:40:09,042 --> 01:40:10,942
You rubes.

1212
01:40:12,140 --> 01:40:14,940
Spend your whole lives
making little boxes,

1213
01:40:15,580 --> 01:40:16,880
little memories.

1214
01:40:18,418 --> 01:40:21,318
Oh, you think they make you so rich.

1215
01:40:21,521 --> 01:40:23,571
You should see mine, kiddo.

1216
01:40:24,757 --> 01:40:27,857
Oh, my mind's a cathedral.

1217
01:40:32,065 --> 01:40:34,365
Well, hi there.

1218
01:40:58,691 --> 01:40:59,891
<i>He said you'd come back.</i>

1219
01:41:01,794 --> 01:41:02,805
<i>And you did.</i>

1220
01:41:04,830 --> 01:41:05,930
<i>Good.</i>

1221
01:41:08,567 --> 01:41:09,375
Get back!

1222
01:41:09,977 --> 01:41:10,977
Get back!

1223
01:41:11,870 --> 01:41:14,370
You're just a fucking child!

1224
01:41:20,112 --> 01:41:20,912
Where are you?

1225
01:41:21,547 --> 01:41:22,309
Where?

1226
01:41:22,611 --> 01:41:23,435
Where did you?

1227
01:41:23,437 --> 01:41:24,368
Where?
What did you?

1228
01:41:24,670 --> 01:41:25,470
Where did you?

1229
01:41:27,486 --> 01:41:28,086
No.

1230
01:41:30,623 --> 01:41:32,023
Get out! Get out!

1231
01:41:32,458 --> 01:41:33,358
Get out!

1232
01:42:19,371 --> 01:42:20,071
Rose?

1233
01:42:20,472 --> 01:42:21,272
Trap.

1234
01:42:21,874 --> 01:42:22,574
Trap.

1235
01:42:23,543 --> 01:42:24,643
What the hell happened?

1236
01:42:24,877 --> 01:42:26,762
That little bitch, set a trap for me.

1237
01:42:26,764 --> 01:42:27,489
Oh, your hand.

1238
01:42:28,112 --> 01:42:29,512
Rose! Rose, calm down.
No!

1239
01:42:29,648 --> 01:42:30,976
We know where she is now, right?

1240
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:31,860
Now we know.

1241
01:42:31,883 --> 01:42:33,383
She was in my head!

1242
01:42:33,419 --> 01:42:34,719
What?
Stealing!

1243
01:42:34,853 --> 01:42:35,853
What does she know?

1244
01:42:35,954 --> 01:42:37,533
I don't know. I don't know.

1245
01:42:37,534 --> 01:42:39,434
How much does she see?
I don't know!

1246
01:42:40,759 --> 01:42:42,159
I don't know.
There's a problem.

1247
01:42:42,328 --> 01:42:43,328
Not now!

1248
01:42:43,428 --> 01:42:44,498
Grampa Flick...

1249
01:42:45,530 --> 01:42:46,830
I think he's cycling.

1250
01:42:52,704 --> 01:42:54,545
<i>Uncle Dan! Uncle Dan!</i>

1251
01:42:54,547 --> 01:42:55,584
<i>I hurt her.</i>

1252
01:42:55,707 --> 01:42:56,718
<i>I really hurt her.</i>

1253
01:42:56,742 --> 01:42:59,086
I hurt her and she deserved it
and that's not the best part.

1254
01:42:59,087 --> 01:42:59,787
The best part is...

1255
01:42:59,788 --> 01:43:01,479
<i>The best part is I got in her head.</i>

1256
01:43:01,481 --> 01:43:02,881
<i>I got in her head.</i>

1257
01:43:03,615 --> 01:43:05,715
<i>Uncle Dan? Are you there?</i>
Oh, God, Abra.

1258
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:06,929
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

1259
01:43:06,953 --> 01:43:07,953
What have you done?

1260
01:43:24,437 --> 01:43:25,737
Just talk to the kid.

1261
01:43:27,005 --> 01:43:28,249
If we're gonna do this,

1262
01:43:28,251 --> 01:43:29,451
then let's do this.

1263
01:43:32,812 --> 01:43:33,914
<i>Hi, Abra.</i>

1264
01:43:37,883 --> 01:43:39,083
I can hear you.

1265
01:43:43,655 --> 01:43:45,055
I don't understand.

1266
01:43:45,657 --> 01:43:46,657
You will.

1267
01:43:48,628 --> 01:43:50,428
I thought we lived forever.

1268
01:43:51,630 --> 01:43:53,530
Did someone promise you that, Andi?

1269
01:43:54,366 --> 01:43:56,566
Did someone say you're immortal?

1270
01:43:57,837 --> 01:44:01,737
I said, live long, eat well.

1271
01:44:02,807 --> 01:44:04,607
We can live long, very long.

1272
01:44:04,810 --> 01:44:05,921
And we do,

1273
01:44:06,145 --> 01:44:07,245
most of us.

1274
01:44:07,746 --> 01:44:09,546
But we haven't been eating well.

1275
01:44:10,950 --> 01:44:12,950
Not for a long time.

1276
01:44:14,053 --> 01:44:15,355
Rosie, he's going.

1277
01:44:16,989 --> 01:44:17,989
Rosie.

1278
01:44:24,062 --> 01:44:25,362
Yes, love?

1279
01:44:26,798 --> 01:44:28,298
I'm scared.

1280
01:44:28,601 --> 01:44:30,101
No, you're not.

1281
01:44:31,670 --> 01:44:35,470
You watched empires rise and fall.

1282
01:44:36,776 --> 01:44:38,776
Cheered the gladiators in Rome.

1283
01:44:39,578 --> 01:44:41,578
Sailed across oceans,

1284
01:44:41,614 --> 01:44:43,324
to new worlds,

1285
01:44:43,848 --> 01:44:46,333
while you fed on kings,

1286
01:44:46,335 --> 01:44:49,135
and princes, and popes.

1287
01:44:49,989 --> 01:44:51,789
They wrote myths of you,

1288
01:44:52,691 --> 01:44:54,791
and made statues,

1289
01:44:55,026 --> 01:44:56,521
and they trembled,

1290
01:44:56,523 --> 01:44:57,859
in their villages,

1291
01:44:58,161 --> 01:44:59,401
and beds,

1292
01:44:59,865 --> 01:45:01,965
and skyscrapers.

1293
01:45:03,636 --> 01:45:04,936
So, no...

1294
01:45:06,071 --> 01:45:08,671
you're not scared.

1295
01:45:10,609 --> 01:45:11,909
You're a king...

1296
01:45:13,512 --> 01:45:15,715
and you eat fear.

1297
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:08,600
Hey, bro.

1298
01:46:08,601 --> 01:46:10,145
You know, it's 4:00 a.m.

1299
01:46:10,269 --> 01:46:11,769
You've always seen me, Billy.

1300
01:46:12,405 --> 01:46:14,905
You have a good sense about
people, is that fair to say?

1301
01:46:15,807 --> 01:46:17,798
Yeah, what...
You think I'm an honest man?

1302
01:46:17,799 --> 01:46:18,899
A good man?

1303
01:46:19,411 --> 01:46:20,689
I do, I do. Dan, I...

1304
01:46:20,713 --> 01:46:21,813
I need your help.

1305
01:46:22,214 --> 01:46:24,082
The first thing I need is for
you to listen to a story

1306
01:46:24,083 --> 01:46:26,283
and try harder than you've ever
tried to believe me.

1307
01:46:43,835 --> 01:46:44,835
How's it going?

1308
01:46:46,172 --> 01:46:47,172
Oh, hey.

1309
01:46:47,273 --> 01:46:48,517
Shouldn't you be
getting ready for school?

1310
01:46:48,941 --> 01:46:50,941
Yeah, but I wanted to tag along.

1311
01:46:51,576 --> 01:46:52,876
How long have you been driving?

1312
01:46:53,044 --> 01:46:54,244
A few hours or so.

1313
01:46:54,813 --> 01:46:56,013
We should get there tonight.
Late.

1314
01:46:58,984 --> 01:47:00,084
Who's that?

1315
01:47:00,753 --> 01:47:01,853
He's my friend.

1316
01:47:03,054 --> 01:47:04,554
Maybe my best friend.

1317
01:47:06,057 --> 01:47:07,757
You should've seen her face.

1318
01:47:08,060 --> 01:47:09,860
She was scared, Uncle Dan.

1319
01:47:10,129 --> 01:47:11,829
Scared like all those kids
were scared.

1320
01:47:12,030 --> 01:47:13,430
All those kids she's killed.

1321
01:47:13,833 --> 01:47:16,033
She was so mad
and so scared that I got in.

1322
01:47:16,936 --> 01:47:18,036
That was a new trick.

1323
01:47:18,536 --> 01:47:19,936
I've never done that before.

1324
01:47:20,071 --> 01:47:21,971
Yeah, me neither.
What was it like?

1325
01:47:22,874 --> 01:47:24,174
Like a library.

1326
01:47:24,477 --> 01:47:26,677
I guess we're all libraries inside.

1327
01:47:27,646 --> 01:47:28,746
How'd you do it?

1328
01:47:29,114 --> 01:47:31,493
Like this. Just a little push.

1329
01:47:36,588 --> 01:47:37,488
Abra!

1330
01:47:37,489 --> 01:47:39,189
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

1331
01:47:44,929 --> 01:47:46,609
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
It's ok.

1332
01:47:48,066 --> 01:47:49,566
What were all those boxes?

1333
01:47:50,035 --> 01:47:51,035
Nothing.

1334
01:47:51,169 --> 01:47:52,169
Liar.

1335
01:47:55,641 --> 01:47:56,841
When I was a kid,

1336
01:47:57,942 --> 01:48:00,842
younger than you, I bumped
into something like these things

1337
01:48:01,045 --> 01:48:03,045
that ate like they do.

1338
01:48:03,815 --> 01:48:06,015
Only it wasn't a person,
it was a place.

1339
01:48:07,753 --> 01:48:09,470
They closed it down after...

1340
01:48:09,672 --> 01:48:11,072
and let it rot.

1341
01:48:12,590 --> 01:48:14,590
But the things that lived there, they...

1342
01:48:16,861 --> 01:48:18,761
Don't go poking around in there again.

1343
01:48:18,931 --> 01:48:21,331
Ok, I won't. I promise.

1344
01:48:34,914 --> 01:48:37,114
We're almost ready.
We're just loading up.

1345
01:48:37,215 --> 01:48:38,215
Good.

1346
01:48:38,683 --> 01:48:39,961
Get the caravan on the road

1347
01:48:39,985 --> 01:48:41,563
and we'll have her in a day or two.

1348
01:48:41,587 --> 01:48:42,987
I don't think you should come, Rosie.

1349
01:48:44,956 --> 01:48:46,756
The fuck did you just say?

1350
01:48:47,026 --> 01:48:48,126
She tagged you.

1351
01:48:48,227 --> 01:48:49,627
She got in your head.

1352
01:48:49,727 --> 01:48:51,027
Yeah, it won't happen again.

1353
01:48:51,028 --> 01:48:53,542
And who knows how much she got
to before you kicked her out.

1354
01:48:53,566 --> 01:48:54,876
She's mine, Crow.

1355
01:48:54,900 --> 01:48:56,211
Right now, as far as we know,

1356
01:48:56,235 --> 01:48:58,335
you are the only one of us
she could track.

1357
01:48:58,771 --> 01:49:00,471
Now, if she sees you coming,

1358
01:49:00,806 --> 01:49:01,906
she could run,

1359
01:49:02,106 --> 01:49:03,606
or set another trap.

1360
01:49:05,643 --> 01:49:07,143
I will knock her out cold.

1361
01:49:08,012 --> 01:49:11,012
One of our assets from the NSA
gave me the good stuff.

1362
01:49:11,115 --> 01:49:13,815
Put her out without
chance of an overdose.

1363
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:16,720
I'll head south.
I'll circle around.

1364
01:49:17,121 --> 01:49:19,021
I'll come at her
from a different direction.

1365
01:49:19,057 --> 01:49:20,257
I should be there.

1366
01:49:20,292 --> 01:49:21,992
You know I'm right about this.

1367
01:49:26,699 --> 01:49:27,699
Ok.

1368
01:49:29,735 --> 01:49:30,877
I'll leave Andi here,

1369
01:49:30,879 --> 01:49:31,829
with you if you want.
No!

1370
01:49:31,837 --> 01:49:33,937
No, no, you'll need your
strength, all of you.

1371
01:49:34,606 --> 01:49:36,006
If she pulls a trick on you,

1372
01:49:36,409 --> 01:49:37,809
stay together.

1373
01:49:38,677 --> 01:49:39,621
Yeah?

1374
01:49:41,012 --> 01:49:42,612
But I got some tricks of my own.

1375
01:49:49,021 --> 01:49:50,121
Hey, I think we're here.

1376
01:49:53,258 --> 01:49:54,258
Ok.

1377
01:49:55,928 --> 01:49:57,128
I'll see if I can get her.

1378
01:49:58,797 --> 01:49:59,797
Abra?

1379
01:50:01,667 --> 01:50:03,767
That's the sign.
Pull around back.

1380
01:50:04,402 --> 01:50:06,002
She says to pull around back.

1381
01:50:06,004 --> 01:50:07,114
And I'll tell you when to stop.

1382
01:50:07,138 --> 01:50:08,538
She'll tell us when to stop.

1383
01:50:15,246 --> 01:50:16,746
I gotta tell you, Danno, I...

1384
01:50:16,747 --> 01:50:19,647
I don't know whether I hope
you're right or wrong about this.

1385
01:50:19,951 --> 01:50:21,451
I mean, if you're wrong,

1386
01:50:21,492 --> 01:50:23,592
my friend is crazy.

1387
01:50:23,655 --> 01:50:25,601
I mean, full-blown,

1388
01:50:26,002 --> 01:50:27,402
mental breakdown,

1389
01:50:27,426 --> 01:50:30,626
imaginary monsters killing
imaginary kids,

1390
01:50:31,195 --> 01:50:32,395
bonkers.

1391
01:50:32,731 --> 01:50:35,101
But, you know, I...
I can work with that.

1392
01:50:36,669 --> 01:50:37,869
If you're right, though...

1393
01:50:37,869 --> 01:50:39,069
I know.

1394
01:50:39,504 --> 01:50:40,804
It's much worse.

1395
01:50:55,286 --> 01:50:56,686
You should go home.

1396
01:50:56,788 --> 01:50:57,788
What?

1397
01:50:58,423 --> 01:50:59,623
No, not you.

1398
01:51:01,093 --> 01:51:02,193
I can handle it.

1399
01:51:02,361 --> 01:51:04,961
No. We'll take it from here.

1400
01:51:08,100 --> 01:51:09,400
Ok, it's just us.

1401
01:51:26,900 --> 01:51:28,135
You smell that?

1402
01:51:31,123 --> 01:51:32,002
Used to hunt.

1403
01:51:32,304 --> 01:51:33,404
I ever tell you that?

1404
01:51:33,459 --> 01:51:34,459
No.

1405
01:51:34,692 --> 01:51:35,692
Deer.

1406
01:51:36,395 --> 01:51:37,395
This one summer,

1407
01:51:38,996 --> 01:51:40,296
I clipped this buck.

1408
01:51:40,932 --> 01:51:42,632
I was tracking it for two days.

1409
01:51:43,302 --> 01:51:44,433
I got the shot,

1410
01:51:44,735 --> 01:51:45,835
clipped him.

1411
01:51:46,539 --> 01:51:48,039
He ran off, I went after.

1412
01:51:49,007 --> 01:51:51,707
Figured he wasn't gonna last long.

1413
01:51:54,245 --> 01:51:55,345
Then he vanished.

1414
01:51:55,914 --> 01:51:57,914
Just up and evaporated.

1415
01:51:58,984 --> 01:52:00,075
Not a trace.

1416
01:52:00,077 --> 01:52:01,277
Truly baffling.

1417
01:52:04,388 --> 01:52:05,488
Five days later,

1418
01:52:05,923 --> 01:52:07,153
I'm trying a different spot,

1419
01:52:07,355 --> 01:52:08,455
miles away.

1420
01:52:08,693 --> 01:52:09,659
I come around...

1421
01:52:10,261 --> 01:52:11,761
looking for a spot for a blind...

1422
01:52:13,932 --> 01:52:15,132
then I smelled him.

1423
01:52:16,802 --> 01:52:18,002
Smelled him.

1424
01:52:19,204 --> 01:52:20,404
Found that buck...

1425
01:52:21,106 --> 01:52:22,806
holed up to a hollow trunk,

1426
01:52:24,176 --> 01:52:25,376
dead for days.

1427
01:52:27,212 --> 01:52:28,312
The smell...

1428
01:52:30,048 --> 01:52:31,448
Never hunted a day since.

1429
01:52:35,387 --> 01:52:37,087
This is the same smell.

1430
01:52:53,271 --> 01:52:54,271
Billy.

1431
01:53:14,258 --> 01:53:15,460
Oh, my God!

1432
01:53:48,493 --> 01:53:49,537
Fuck.

1433
01:53:49,561 --> 01:53:51,961
Fuck, Danno. What the fuck?

1434
01:53:52,129 --> 01:53:54,876
They didn't even bury him deep.
They buried him shallow.

1435
01:53:54,900 --> 01:53:55,902
I'm sorry, Billy.

1436
01:53:57,535 --> 01:53:58,835
What did you get us into?

1437
01:54:07,612 --> 01:54:08,912
The people who did that...

1438
01:54:09,213 --> 01:54:10,313
They're not people.

1439
01:54:11,616 --> 01:54:13,416
No. No, they ain't.

1440
01:54:14,486 --> 01:54:16,086
Anyone do that to a little boy,

1441
01:54:17,356 --> 01:54:18,556
they ain't people.

1442
01:54:19,624 --> 01:54:20,824
Did you get it?

1443
01:54:21,159 --> 01:54:22,259
Yeah, we got it.

1444
01:54:22,294 --> 01:54:23,394
Is she back?

1445
01:54:24,161 --> 01:54:26,061
We're heading back to you.
We'll be back in the morning.

1446
01:54:26,097 --> 01:54:27,199
We got a stop to make.

1447
01:54:29,601 --> 01:54:31,801
I need you to show your parents
what's happening.

1448
01:54:32,570 --> 01:54:33,974
No.
Yeah.

1449
01:54:33,976 --> 01:54:36,176
No. They almost think I'm normal.

1450
01:54:36,642 --> 01:54:38,092
If I tell them, they'll...

1451
01:54:38,100 --> 01:54:39,600
Rose'll go through them to get to you.

1452
01:54:39,777 --> 01:54:41,177
You know that, don't you?

1453
01:54:41,213 --> 01:54:43,053
She'll cut them down
without a second thought.

1454
01:54:43,248 --> 01:54:44,748
And she's coming, Abra.

1455
01:54:45,549 --> 01:54:46,849
They need to know.

1456
01:54:52,156 --> 01:54:53,556
So, what's this stop we gotta make?

1457
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:56,300
You still got those old deer rifles?

1458
01:55:14,178 --> 01:55:15,178
You're Uncle Dan?

1459
01:55:15,813 --> 01:55:17,158
The fuck you think you are?
Sir...

1460
01:55:17,982 --> 01:55:19,382
She is 13 years old!

1461
01:55:19,383 --> 01:55:20,683
Abra, I told you to show him.

1462
01:55:20,718 --> 01:55:22,118
I told him.
Well, that's not the same.

1463
01:55:22,119 --> 01:55:23,619
I'm gonna kick your ass
before I call the police?

1464
01:55:23,955 --> 01:55:25,055
Hey, hey, hey!
No, no, no. Abra.

1465
01:55:25,123 --> 01:55:26,223
Now, don't you say her name.

1466
01:55:26,290 --> 01:55:26,990
Abra...

1467
01:55:42,206 --> 01:55:43,278
I'm sorry, Mr. Stone.

1468
01:55:43,480 --> 01:55:44,680
I am a friend.

1469
01:55:45,509 --> 01:55:47,209
Everything she told you is true.

1470
01:55:50,700 --> 01:55:52,000
What the hell is happening?

1471
01:55:52,517 --> 01:55:53,717
I'm sorry.

1472
01:55:54,319 --> 01:55:55,919
Abra needs to show you something.

1473
01:55:56,687 --> 01:55:57,787
I saw the boy.

1474
01:55:58,123 --> 01:55:59,223
I saw his body.

1475
01:55:59,758 --> 01:56:00,858
It's all true.

1476
01:56:00,859 --> 01:56:02,759
Probably, your friend here
put him there.

1477
01:56:04,029 --> 01:56:05,229
You think about that?

1478
01:56:05,731 --> 01:56:07,131
Not for long, I didn't.

1479
01:56:07,199 --> 01:56:09,299
Mr. Stone, your daughter is special.

1480
01:56:09,534 --> 01:56:10,594
Don't talk about her.

1481
01:56:10,595 --> 01:56:11,890
I think you know that.

1482
01:56:11,892 --> 01:56:12,892
Deep down.

1483
01:56:14,638 --> 01:56:16,538
She knows what happened
to that little boy,

1484
01:56:17,409 --> 01:56:18,609
and she knows who did it.

1485
01:56:20,120 --> 01:56:21,188
Show him.

1486
01:56:25,540 --> 01:56:26,640
I'm sorry, Daddy.

1487
01:56:26,985 --> 01:56:28,585
I really didn't want to.

1488
01:56:29,454 --> 01:56:30,564
Didn't want to what?

1489
01:56:49,206 --> 01:56:50,206
No, thanks.

1490
01:56:50,241 --> 01:56:51,241
No.

1491
01:57:00,518 --> 01:57:01,618
Those people...

1492
01:57:03,554 --> 01:57:04,854
they know about my daughter?

1493
01:57:05,356 --> 01:57:06,556
They do.

1494
01:57:06,891 --> 01:57:08,991
And sooner or later, they're coming.

1495
01:57:09,660 --> 01:57:10,960
We gotta do something.

1496
01:57:11,200 --> 01:57:13,100
Alright, we're calling the police, the FBI...

1497
01:57:13,365 --> 01:57:15,565
These people have been
around a long, long time, sir.

1498
01:57:15,901 --> 01:57:17,412
They're rich, connected.

1499
01:57:17,636 --> 01:57:19,436
I don't think they're worried
about the police.

1500
01:57:19,904 --> 01:57:21,104
But where are they?

1501
01:57:21,673 --> 01:57:23,773
When are they coming?
Where can we go?

1502
01:57:23,842 --> 01:57:25,342
Abra can answer that...

1503
01:57:26,178 --> 01:57:27,178
if she's ready.

1504
01:57:28,646 --> 01:57:29,646
I'm ready.

1505
01:57:39,691 --> 01:57:41,091
You sure you wanna do this?

1506
01:57:41,726 --> 01:57:42,726
I have to.

1507
01:58:25,437 --> 01:58:26,437
I-95.

1508
01:58:27,039 --> 01:58:29,239
Barry, the Crow, the Snake,
and a few others.

1509
01:58:29,641 --> 01:58:31,701
The trees haven't changed that much so...

1510
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,800
maybe Massachusetts but...

1511
01:58:34,067 --> 01:58:35,567
they're close.
Rose?

1512
01:58:35,847 --> 01:58:36,947
Didn't see her.

1513
01:58:37,749 --> 01:58:38,849
But they're coming.

1514
01:58:43,100 --> 01:58:44,800
This is the only room she saw?

1515
01:58:45,589 --> 01:58:46,589
That's right.

1516
01:58:46,924 --> 01:58:48,319
And I made a few changes.

1517
01:58:48,321 --> 01:58:49,521
Hid a few things.

1518
01:58:50,300 --> 01:58:51,400
Alright.

1519
01:58:52,364 --> 01:58:54,064
Well, they'll be trying to track you,

1520
01:58:54,433 --> 01:58:56,133
trying to catch on.

1521
01:58:58,200 --> 01:58:59,400
And you're gonna let them.

1522
01:59:00,773 --> 01:59:02,173
Are you crazy?

1523
01:59:02,507 --> 01:59:04,107
Possibly, but you're gonna let them.

1524
01:59:04,776 --> 01:59:06,776
And then I need you to try
and do a little trick.

1525
01:59:08,312 --> 01:59:09,512
A magic trick?

1526
01:59:17,489 --> 01:59:18,689
They're following us.

1527
01:59:19,500 --> 01:59:21,700
Concentrate. You gotta keep it
up until they land.

1528
01:59:22,427 --> 01:59:23,427
I know.

1529
01:59:55,300 --> 01:59:56,400
This should work.

1530
01:59:56,640 --> 01:59:58,940
Good blinds over there, and there.

1531
02:00:02,534 --> 02:00:03,634
They still close?

1532
02:00:03,668 --> 02:00:04,818
Getting closer, I think.

1533
02:00:05,669 --> 02:00:06,769
This is tough.

1534
02:00:06,838 --> 02:00:07,831
I know. I know.

1535
02:00:07,833 --> 02:00:09,033
Not much longer.

1536
02:00:12,944 --> 02:00:14,344
Ok, Crow Daddy,

1537
02:00:15,547 --> 02:00:16,647
go get her.

1538
02:01:03,794 --> 02:01:05,194
You look relaxed.

1539
02:01:06,498 --> 02:01:08,798
You feel relaxed, don't you, Abra?

1540
02:01:10,302 --> 02:01:11,302
I guess.

1541
02:01:11,402 --> 02:01:12,402
You should.

1542
02:01:13,338 --> 02:01:14,738
Just relax.

1543
02:01:15,005 --> 02:01:16,205
We're friends.

1544
02:01:16,674 --> 02:01:18,074
You're friends.

1545
02:01:18,442 --> 02:01:19,578
That's right.

1546
02:01:20,611 --> 02:01:21,911
Just friends.

1547
02:01:22,746 --> 02:01:25,646
And we want to take you
to meet more friends.

1548
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:28,687
Good friends.

1549
02:01:33,023 --> 02:01:34,223
Well, shit.

1550
02:01:34,558 --> 02:01:35,858
The way they talked you up,

1551
02:01:35,859 --> 02:01:37,659
I was thinking it'd be
a little harder than that.

1552
02:01:42,866 --> 02:01:43,966
The fuck?

1553
02:01:44,636 --> 02:01:46,881
Parlor tricks.
Just fucking parlor tricks.

1554
02:01:51,476 --> 02:01:52,776
No! Get out of there!

1555
02:01:52,877 --> 02:01:53,946
Get out of there!

1556
02:02:00,985 --> 02:02:02,285
No!

1557
02:02:16,034 --> 02:02:16,834
No!

1558
02:02:26,878 --> 02:02:27,978
<i>You deserve it.</i>

1559
02:02:28,079 --> 02:02:30,279
You deserve it. All of you.

1560
02:02:35,853 --> 02:02:36,653
No!

1561
02:03:34,376 --> 02:03:35,076
Fuck.

1562
02:03:35,813 --> 02:03:36,613
Stop.

1563
02:03:41,619 --> 02:03:44,019
I just got one question for you, sweetie.

1564
02:03:45,757 --> 02:03:47,057
Aren't you sleepy?

1565
02:03:50,027 --> 02:03:51,427
You're sleepy.

1566
02:03:56,633 --> 02:03:57,533
Sleep.

1567
02:03:59,803 --> 02:04:00,803
Sleep.

1568
02:04:03,407 --> 02:04:04,907
Wake up! Uncle Dan!

1569
02:04:05,043 --> 02:04:05,743
Wake up!

1570
02:04:06,145 --> 02:04:06,945
Wake up.

1571
02:04:07,579 --> 02:04:08,379
<i>Wake up!</i>

1572
02:04:09,880 --> 02:04:10,880
Fucking men.

1573
02:04:13,116 --> 02:04:14,716
Fucking men.

1574
02:04:31,503 --> 02:04:32,503
Stay back, Billy.

1575
02:04:35,940 --> 02:04:37,540
Kill yourself.

1576
02:04:40,178 --> 02:04:40,978
No!

1577
02:04:41,579 --> 02:04:43,081
Billy!

1578
02:04:59,263 --> 02:05:00,563
There is one missing.

1579
02:05:01,732 --> 02:05:02,913
I didn't see the Crow.

1580
02:05:03,215 --> 02:05:04,315
Where is the Crow?

1581
02:05:06,538 --> 02:05:07,538
Hello, Abra.

1582
02:05:14,012 --> 02:05:15,212
Abra!

1583
02:05:19,217 --> 02:05:20,317
Get away from her.

1584
02:05:24,121 --> 02:05:25,121
Step back.

1585
02:05:28,125 --> 02:05:29,325
Sure thing, Dad.

1586
02:05:31,629 --> 02:05:33,529
You know, I'm glad I got to meet you.

1587
02:05:33,630 --> 02:05:36,130
I'll fucking kill you.
Step back.

1588
02:05:36,267 --> 02:05:37,467
Some brave words.

1589
02:05:37,936 --> 02:05:41,136
Always tickles me,
watching you rubes threaten a god.

1590
02:05:42,807 --> 02:05:44,107
You know, your little girl,

1591
02:05:44,976 --> 02:05:46,976
she's maybe the best food
we'll ever have.

1592
02:05:48,612 --> 02:05:51,512
I'm so glad I had a chance
to compliment the chef.

1593
02:06:29,954 --> 02:06:31,354
Oh, good, you're awake.

1594
02:06:42,133 --> 02:06:43,133
Dan...

1595
02:06:43,301 --> 02:06:44,501
Don't bother.

1596
02:06:51,976 --> 02:06:53,276
What's wrong with me?

1597
02:06:53,945 --> 02:06:55,445
You've been dosed, missy.

1598
02:06:56,047 --> 02:06:57,547
More than I've ever used before.

1599
02:06:58,700 --> 02:07:00,900
Might let you wake up
here and there but...

1600
02:07:01,151 --> 02:07:03,251
that steam of yours is fast asleep.

1601
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:07,900
My dad...

1602
02:07:09,326 --> 02:07:10,626
What happened to my dad?

1603
02:07:11,195 --> 02:07:12,695
Lot of good people killed today.

1604
02:07:13,931 --> 02:07:15,331
Lot of good people.

1605
02:07:17,035 --> 02:07:18,735
I'd love to tell you someone will pay,

1606
02:07:19,370 --> 02:07:21,452
some kind of justice raining down,

1607
02:07:21,454 --> 02:07:23,554
on the sad events today but,

1608
02:07:24,400 --> 02:07:25,600
it don't work like that.

1609
02:07:26,700 --> 02:07:28,300
We were always gonna have you.

1610
02:07:29,800 --> 02:07:31,200
Some of my people are dead.

1611
02:07:32,249 --> 02:07:33,649
Some of yours are dead.

1612
02:07:34,718 --> 02:07:36,918
Outcome didn't change, though.

1613
02:07:38,021 --> 02:07:39,290
Think on that a minute.

1614
02:07:40,357 --> 02:07:41,957
The outcome didn't change.

1615
02:07:42,860 --> 02:07:44,060
So, their deaths,

1616
02:07:45,100 --> 02:07:46,100
all of them,

1617
02:07:46,998 --> 02:07:48,198
just a waste.

1618
02:07:49,299 --> 02:07:51,999
A waste you brought on
to us all, young lady.

1619
02:07:52,837 --> 02:07:53,937
For what?

1620
02:07:55,873 --> 02:07:57,273
Please hear me...

1621
02:07:57,575 --> 02:07:59,175
Ain't nobody hearing you.

1622
02:08:00,312 --> 02:08:02,680
Might as well calm down
and enjoy the ride.

1623
02:08:04,115 --> 02:08:05,315
Like I said,

1624
02:08:06,417 --> 02:08:07,917
outcome hasn't changed.

1625
02:08:28,972 --> 02:08:29,972
No.

1626
02:08:31,909 --> 02:08:32,909
Please.

1627
02:08:33,377 --> 02:08:35,446
Oh, please, please, please.

1628
02:08:37,013 --> 02:08:37,813
Please.

1629
02:08:41,600 --> 02:08:42,600
Abra!

1630
02:08:46,289 --> 02:08:47,289
<i>Abra.</i>

1631
02:08:54,600 --> 02:08:55,600
Tony?

1632
02:08:57,900 --> 02:08:59,400
Help me please, Tony.

1633
02:09:05,543 --> 02:09:06,543
God.

1634
02:09:17,187 --> 02:09:18,687
Ok. Ok.

1635
02:09:19,423 --> 02:09:20,423
Ok, ok.

1636
02:09:20,891 --> 02:09:22,091
Ok, you always said...

1637
02:09:23,427 --> 02:09:24,727
your brain was like a radio.

1638
02:09:25,200 --> 02:09:27,400
No one's answering
when you call, so stop calling.

1639
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:29,100
And just listen.

1640
02:09:47,218 --> 02:09:49,118
<i>Dan. Dan.</i>

1641
02:09:49,587 --> 02:09:50,587
<i>Help.</i>

1642
02:10:05,069 --> 02:10:06,069
Hi.

1643
02:10:06,204 --> 02:10:07,272
Dan.

1644
02:10:10,473 --> 02:10:11,673
Did he drug you?

1645
02:10:13,210 --> 02:10:14,310
I'm so sorry.

1646
02:10:16,146 --> 02:10:17,446
I'm gonna try something, ok?

1647
02:10:17,815 --> 02:10:18,915
But you're weak.

1648
02:10:18,950 --> 02:10:20,350
He's blocking you.

1649
02:10:20,685 --> 02:10:22,085
I could barely hear you.

1650
02:10:23,154 --> 02:10:24,254
You gotta trust me, ok?

1651
02:10:26,456 --> 02:10:27,456
Ok?

1652
02:10:41,700 --> 02:10:42,900
Awake again?

1653
02:10:44,907 --> 02:10:47,307
Might have to dose you
at the next rest stop.

1654
02:10:49,547 --> 02:10:50,647
Where are we going?

1655
02:10:52,016 --> 02:10:53,016
You know where.

1656
02:10:54,317 --> 02:10:56,117
Fuck, I feel hungover.

1657
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:00,800
I told you it's good shit.

1658
02:11:01,959 --> 02:11:03,510
Haven't felt hungover in years.

1659
02:11:03,512 --> 02:11:05,012
And you know, I don't miss it.

1660
02:11:05,013 --> 02:11:06,213
Not even a little.

1661
02:11:08,432 --> 02:11:09,532
West?

1662
02:11:10,267 --> 02:11:11,693
Staying off the major roads.

1663
02:11:12,095 --> 02:11:13,095
Smart.

1664
02:11:15,239 --> 02:11:16,606
Crownville.

1665
02:11:16,908 --> 02:11:17,840
New York.

1666
02:11:20,945 --> 02:11:22,145
Who are you?

1667
02:11:23,400 --> 02:11:25,000
I'm the guy that killed your friends.

1668
02:11:31,100 --> 02:11:32,500
It's nice to meet you.

1669
02:11:34,424 --> 02:11:35,524
Neat trick.

1670
02:11:36,093 --> 02:11:37,893
Haven't seen this one before.

1671
02:11:38,062 --> 02:11:39,362
Wanna see one more?

1672
02:11:43,066 --> 02:11:46,066
Don't imagine Rose'll be too
happy if you shoot the prize.

1673
02:11:49,200 --> 02:11:52,000
I don't suppose Rose will be
happy about any of this.

1674
02:11:52,709 --> 02:11:54,409
And when that woman gets mad...

1675
02:11:55,478 --> 02:11:56,380
Well...

1676
02:11:56,482 --> 02:11:59,882
it seems to me you know enough
to know you might wanna sit this one out.

1677
02:12:01,017 --> 02:12:02,317
Count your blessings.

1678
02:12:02,486 --> 02:12:03,686
Go on your way.

1679
02:12:06,490 --> 02:12:07,790
What's so funny, friend?

1680
02:12:08,191 --> 02:12:09,900
Well, it's just arrogance.

1681
02:12:10,402 --> 02:12:11,602
It's arrogance, really.

1682
02:12:12,195 --> 02:12:14,995
But it makes sense,
if you think you're gonna live forever.

1683
02:12:15,598 --> 02:12:16,833
Stands to reason,

1684
02:12:17,535 --> 02:12:19,735
of course you wouldn't wear your seatbelt.

1685
02:12:30,547 --> 02:12:32,447
No!

1686
02:12:43,194 --> 02:12:44,194
Dan?

1687
02:12:45,996 --> 02:12:46,996
Dan?

1688
02:13:18,562 --> 02:13:19,962
I hope that hurts.

1689
02:13:20,697 --> 02:13:21,697
Rosie...

1690
02:13:23,066 --> 02:13:24,066
A lot.

1691
02:14:12,115 --> 02:14:14,151
You little bitch.

1692
02:14:16,253 --> 02:14:17,553
What have you done?

1693
02:14:29,700 --> 02:14:31,300
Alright, bitch child.

1694
02:14:32,503 --> 02:14:33,403
Alright.

1695
02:15:41,804 --> 02:15:42,804
Sorry.

1696
02:15:43,273 --> 02:15:44,373
Dozed off.

1697
02:15:44,441 --> 02:15:45,841
No, you earned it.

1698
02:15:49,480 --> 02:15:50,680
Where are we?

1699
02:15:50,713 --> 02:15:51,713
Ohio.

1700
02:15:52,715 --> 02:15:53,815
Where are we going?

1701
02:15:53,851 --> 02:15:54,851
Colorado.

1702
02:15:56,553 --> 02:15:57,953
Why Colorado?

1703
02:16:00,624 --> 02:16:02,124
She's gonna keep coming.

1704
02:16:03,526 --> 02:16:04,726
I know.
Always.

1705
02:16:06,400 --> 02:16:07,800
This only ends if we end it,

1706
02:16:07,897 --> 02:16:09,797
and I don't think we can beat her.

1707
02:16:10,100 --> 02:16:11,500
Not by ourselves.

1708
02:16:13,971 --> 02:16:15,171
There's a place.

1709
02:16:15,600 --> 02:16:17,600
A place that's dangerous
for people like us.

1710
02:16:18,475 --> 02:16:19,987
The place you told me about?

1711
02:16:20,589 --> 02:16:21,622
The hungry place?

1712
02:16:21,623 --> 02:16:22,623
Yeah, that's right.

1713
02:16:22,724 --> 02:16:24,124
If it's so dangerous...

1714
02:16:24,195 --> 02:16:25,495
why would we go there?

1715
02:16:26,217 --> 02:16:28,217
Well, if it's dangerous
for people like us,

1716
02:16:28,619 --> 02:16:30,719
I expect it's dangerous
for people like her.

1717
02:16:31,554 --> 02:16:32,854
Maybe even more so.

1718
02:16:34,300 --> 02:16:35,100
Good.

1719
02:16:36,426 --> 02:16:38,126
She's following us, you know.

1720
02:16:39,295 --> 02:16:40,695
Yeah, good. Let her.

1721
02:16:48,806 --> 02:16:50,206
I'm sorry about your father.

1722
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:54,700
Sorry about your friend.

1723
02:17:18,068 --> 02:17:19,168
It's my mom.

1724
02:17:20,004 --> 02:17:21,204
What do I say to her?

1725
02:17:26,009 --> 02:17:26,909
Hi, Mom.

1726
02:17:26,977 --> 02:17:27,977
Oh, thank God!

1727
02:17:28,345 --> 02:17:29,345
Abra...

1728
02:17:29,513 --> 02:17:31,013
Are you ok? Where are you?

1729
02:17:32,049 --> 02:17:33,149
I love you.

1730
02:17:36,487 --> 02:17:38,687
When we're safe, you'll call her
and tell her where to find us?

1731
02:17:38,855 --> 02:17:39,855
I will.

1732
02:17:40,024 --> 02:17:40,824
Ok.

1733
02:18:15,059 --> 02:18:16,435
Not too much further.

1734
02:18:16,437 --> 02:18:17,437
Up the mountain.

1735
02:19:53,023 --> 02:19:54,123
Here's what we're gonna do.

1736
02:19:54,525 --> 02:19:55,680
You're gonna stay in the car,

1737
02:19:55,982 --> 02:19:57,282
keep the heater running.

1738
02:19:57,693 --> 02:20:00,493
I don't want you spending a minute
inside there if you don't have to.

1739
02:20:00,698 --> 02:20:02,442
She can only come from here.

1740
02:20:02,666 --> 02:20:04,177
You can see her a mile out, easy.

1741
02:20:04,201 --> 02:20:06,201
You see lights
on the mountain over there,

1742
02:20:06,569 --> 02:20:07,869
you blast me, ok?

1743
02:20:08,138 --> 02:20:10,238
But I don't want you going in.
Not until she's here.

1744
02:20:11,607 --> 02:20:13,407
You aren't waiting with me?

1745
02:20:14,111 --> 02:20:15,076
I can't.

1746
02:20:15,077 --> 02:20:16,077
Why not?

1747
02:20:17,047 --> 02:20:18,147
I have to wake it up.

1748
02:21:20,443 --> 02:21:21,679
Wakey-wakey.

1749
02:26:01,424 --> 02:26:03,024
Slow night, Mr. Torrance.

1750
02:26:03,300 --> 02:26:05,000
Not for long, I imagine.

1751
02:26:06,830 --> 02:26:08,430
You're a whiskey man, are you not?

1752
02:26:08,765 --> 02:26:10,765
I was, most of the time.

1753
02:26:18,742 --> 02:26:19,942
On the house.

1754
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:25,500
This was your brand.

1755
02:26:26,183 --> 02:26:27,383
Jack Daniel's.

1756
02:26:27,717 --> 02:26:29,817
I used to see the bottles in our home.

1757
02:26:30,419 --> 02:26:32,019
Our real home, before all this.

1758
02:26:33,756 --> 02:26:35,119
I smelled one once.

1759
02:26:35,121 --> 02:26:37,232
It smelled like something on fire,
which...

1760
02:26:38,134 --> 02:26:39,434
I suppose it was.

1761
02:26:40,797 --> 02:26:43,097
I'm afraid you've confused me
with someone else.

1762
02:26:43,533 --> 02:26:44,633
It's Lloyd.

1763
02:26:45,568 --> 02:26:46,568
Lloyd.

1764
02:26:48,304 --> 02:26:50,104
I apologize, Mr. Torrance.

1765
02:26:50,272 --> 02:26:51,939
I don't know where everyone is, but...

1766
02:26:52,341 --> 02:26:53,441
it'll pick up.

1767
02:26:54,410 --> 02:26:55,710
Oh, I know where they are.

1768
02:26:56,312 --> 02:26:57,412
And you're right...

1769
02:26:58,281 --> 02:26:59,281
it'll pick up.

1770
02:27:01,618 --> 02:27:04,218
If you don't mind my saying,
Mr. Torrance, you seem...

1771
02:27:05,856 --> 02:27:06,991
put upon.

1772
02:27:08,091 --> 02:27:09,291
Put upon?

1773
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:11,200
Ain't that the way.

1774
02:27:12,300 --> 02:27:14,000
Man just living his life,

1775
02:27:14,297 --> 02:27:15,697
trying to do his work.

1776
02:27:16,399 --> 02:27:17,899
He gets put upon.

1777
02:27:18,500 --> 02:27:20,369
Pulled into other people's problems.

1778
02:27:20,370 --> 02:27:22,970
I see it all the time,
if you don't mind my saying.

1779
02:27:26,076 --> 02:27:27,776
So we lived in Florida.

1780
02:27:28,912 --> 02:27:29,922
I'm sorry?

1781
02:27:30,146 --> 02:27:31,346
Mom and I.

1782
02:27:32,214 --> 02:27:34,214
I'm afraid I don't know
who you mean.

1783
02:27:36,920 --> 02:27:39,020
We never wanted to see snow again,

1784
02:27:40,023 --> 02:27:41,523
so we lived in Florida.

1785
02:27:41,925 --> 02:27:44,925
Tiny place, but it was
comfortable, and we were happy.

1786
02:27:45,495 --> 02:27:46,995
I mean, we were grieving.

1787
02:27:50,166 --> 02:27:51,566
We were traumatized,

1788
02:27:52,034 --> 02:27:53,634
but there was happiness too.

1789
02:27:57,100 --> 02:27:57,800
She...

1790
02:27:59,609 --> 02:28:00,909
She would look away.

1791
02:28:01,711 --> 02:28:04,811
She'd look at me, but she'd always
look away after a second or two.

1792
02:28:06,583 --> 02:28:09,034
It took me a while to notice it.
But after the Overlook,

1793
02:28:09,436 --> 02:28:11,636
she wouldn't look me in the eyes,
not for long.

1794
02:28:12,656 --> 02:28:14,056
Couldn't figure it out.

1795
02:28:16,693 --> 02:28:17,593
But it...

1796
02:28:21,563 --> 02:28:22,563
It was you.

1797
02:28:25,267 --> 02:28:26,967
She saw your eyes in me,

1798
02:28:27,093 --> 02:28:28,893
and she'd have to look away.

1799
02:28:30,307 --> 02:28:32,007
It tortured her to have to do that.

1800
02:28:32,075 --> 02:28:33,175
So, I fixed it.

1801
02:28:33,777 --> 02:28:36,377
I fixed it for her, and it was
the last time I ever used it.

1802
02:28:36,913 --> 02:28:39,950
So that she wouldn't see you
anymore when she looked at me.

1803
02:28:43,219 --> 02:28:44,619
I was 20 when she died.

1804
02:28:45,522 --> 02:28:46,540
And back then,

1805
02:28:47,542 --> 02:28:50,542
I saw when someone was
gonna die, I saw flies.

1806
02:28:50,592 --> 02:28:51,571
Black flies.

1807
02:28:51,594 --> 02:28:54,594
Death flies, I called them,
circling people's faces.

1808
02:28:55,464 --> 02:28:58,064
And in those last weeks,
she was covered...

1809
02:28:58,335 --> 02:28:59,535
Her whole face.

1810
02:29:00,102 --> 02:29:01,802
I could barely see her eyes.

1811
02:29:03,339 --> 02:29:05,305
And I... I tried to comfort her, but...

1812
02:29:06,107 --> 02:29:07,607
I could hardly look at her.

1813
02:29:08,277 --> 02:29:09,677
And she saw that.

1814
02:29:12,515 --> 02:29:13,915
She just lay there dying,

1815
02:29:14,616 --> 02:29:16,516
with her son who couldn't look at her.

1816
02:29:22,559 --> 02:29:24,027
Maybe something warm...

1817
02:29:24,429 --> 02:29:26,229
to push away such unpleasantries.

1818
02:29:26,262 --> 02:29:27,745
Don't you wanna hear about it?

1819
02:29:28,247 --> 02:29:29,247
She was your wife.

1820
02:29:29,331 --> 02:29:31,631
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

1821
02:29:32,469 --> 02:29:34,469
I'm just a bartender.
Oh, yeah?

1822
02:29:35,772 --> 02:29:39,017
Just Lloyd the bartender,
pouring joy at the Overlook Hotel.

1823
02:29:39,041 --> 02:29:41,041
I'll pour whatever you like, Mr. Torrance.

1824
02:29:43,212 --> 02:29:44,212
Oh, Dad.

1825
02:29:46,282 --> 02:29:48,382
This drink will cost an awful lot.

1826
02:29:48,517 --> 02:29:50,217
Your money is no good here.

1827
02:29:50,552 --> 02:29:52,152
Orders from the house.

1828
02:29:52,422 --> 02:29:53,922
It'll cost more than money.

1829
02:29:54,390 --> 02:29:56,190
It'll cost me eight years.

1830
02:29:56,759 --> 02:29:59,259
Eight behind me, and who knows
how many in front of me.

1831
02:29:59,294 --> 02:30:01,494
Your credit is fine, Mr. Torrance.

1832
02:30:09,204 --> 02:30:10,404
Man takes a drink,

1833
02:30:12,175 --> 02:30:13,375
the drink takes a drink,

1834
02:30:14,643 --> 02:30:16,343
and then the drink takes a man.

1835
02:30:17,547 --> 02:30:18,747
Ain't it so, Dad?

1836
02:30:23,386 --> 02:30:24,486
Medicine.

1837
02:30:26,389 --> 02:30:27,989
Medicine is what it is.

1838
02:30:29,258 --> 02:30:30,958
Bona fide cure-all.

1839
02:30:31,527 --> 02:30:36,366
Depression, stress, remorse,
failure, wipes it all away.

1840
02:30:37,933 --> 02:30:39,733
The mind is a blackboard.

1841
02:30:40,669 --> 02:30:41,769
And this...

1842
02:30:42,704 --> 02:30:43,904
is the eraser.

1843
02:30:49,479 --> 02:30:50,679
A man tries.

1844
02:30:51,613 --> 02:30:52,749
He provides.

1845
02:30:54,049 --> 02:30:55,849
But he's surrounded by mouths.

1846
02:30:56,252 --> 02:30:58,652
That eat, and scream, and cry,
and nag.

1847
02:30:59,488 --> 02:31:02,388
So he asks for one thing,
just one thing for him.

1848
02:31:03,100 --> 02:31:04,300
To warm him up...

1849
02:31:04,660 --> 02:31:07,705
to take the sting out of
those days of the mouths,

1850
02:31:07,729 --> 02:31:10,229
eating, and eating, and eating
everything he makes,

1851
02:31:10,499 --> 02:31:12,099
everything he has.

1852
02:31:13,103 --> 02:31:14,403
And a family.

1853
02:31:14,670 --> 02:31:16,670
A wife, a kid.

1854
02:31:18,108 --> 02:31:19,808
Those mouths eat time.

1855
02:31:20,676 --> 02:31:22,326
They eat your days on Earth.

1856
02:31:23,679 --> 02:31:25,079
They just gobble them up.

1857
02:31:26,748 --> 02:31:28,848
It's enough to make a man sick.

1858
02:31:30,120 --> 02:31:31,220
And this...

1859
02:31:32,422 --> 02:31:33,822
is the medicine.

1860
02:31:36,559 --> 02:31:38,059
So tell me pup,

1861
02:31:39,529 --> 02:31:41,929
are you gonna take your medicine?

1862
02:31:45,001 --> 02:31:46,101
I'm not.

1863
02:31:49,973 --> 02:31:51,373
Look at that. I'm sorry.

1864
02:31:51,500 --> 02:31:53,523
Clumsy old me, Mr. Torrance.

1865
02:31:53,525 --> 02:31:54,525
Forgive me.

1866
02:31:55,946 --> 02:31:57,346
Let's get you cleaned up.

1867
02:32:15,831 --> 02:32:17,531
Management is concerned.

1868
02:32:17,834 --> 02:32:19,203
Concerned?

1869
02:32:21,570 --> 02:32:23,370
It's horrible what she's done to you.

1870
02:32:24,174 --> 02:32:25,874
Pulled you into her mess.

1871
02:32:28,244 --> 02:32:29,544
A smart man?

1872
02:32:30,747 --> 02:32:32,547
He'd let her handle it.

1873
02:32:33,783 --> 02:32:35,983
Let things unfold as they're meant to.

1874
02:32:37,319 --> 02:32:39,319
Why should you pay her tab, Doc?

1875
02:32:41,424 --> 02:32:42,524
And for what?

1876
02:32:43,293 --> 02:32:45,101
For this little girl,

1877
02:32:45,103 --> 02:32:47,003
who started all this trouble?

1878
02:32:47,363 --> 02:32:49,463
What would management
have me do about that?

1879
02:32:50,567 --> 02:32:51,667
Nothing.

1880
02:32:52,735 --> 02:32:54,935
Easiest thing in the world to do, son.

1881
02:32:55,672 --> 02:32:57,372
Just bring her inside.

1882
02:32:57,873 --> 02:32:59,073
And then, well...

1883
02:33:00,375 --> 02:33:03,275
you accept the things
you cannot change.

1884
02:33:04,647 --> 02:33:05,647
<i>Dan!</i>

1885
02:33:05,815 --> 02:33:06,815
<i>She's here.</i>

1886
02:33:24,866 --> 02:33:25,866
Ok.

1887
02:33:40,783 --> 02:33:42,183
This place is sick.

1888
02:33:43,518 --> 02:33:45,218
Sick like my momo was sick.

1889
02:33:45,888 --> 02:33:47,088
It's cancer,

1890
02:33:47,523 --> 02:33:48,723
only worse.

1891
02:33:57,033 --> 02:33:58,233
What do we do now?

1892
02:33:58,634 --> 02:34:00,034
We head inside. She'll find us.

1893
02:35:50,646 --> 02:35:52,946
Well, well, well.

1894
02:35:54,851 --> 02:35:55,951
Hi there.

1895
02:35:56,586 --> 02:35:58,786
<i>When this starts, run.</i>

1896
02:35:59,821 --> 02:36:01,721
Yes, you run, dear.

1897
02:36:02,692 --> 02:36:04,392
And then I will find you...

1898
02:36:05,060 --> 02:36:08,931
and you will scream for years
until you die.

1899
02:36:10,999 --> 02:36:12,799
We'll see who does the screaming.

1900
02:36:13,668 --> 02:36:15,068
Oh, we'll see indeed.

1901
02:36:15,470 --> 02:36:16,670
She's right, you know.

1902
02:36:17,472 --> 02:36:18,772
You should be afraid.

1903
02:36:20,109 --> 02:36:21,409
Why is that?

1904
02:36:22,544 --> 02:36:24,244
Because you don't know
where you're standing.

1905
02:36:25,148 --> 02:36:26,948
I'm sorry, who are you handsome?

1906
02:36:31,686 --> 02:36:34,486
You're the one who killed
my Crow, aren't you?

1907
02:36:36,525 --> 02:36:37,525
Go.

1908
02:37:38,720 --> 02:37:39,820
Clever.

1909
02:37:41,023 --> 02:37:42,823
You've made some improvements,
haven't you?

1910
02:37:44,526 --> 02:37:46,626
Since the last time I was in your mind.

1911
02:37:47,062 --> 02:37:48,762
<i>How do you know
we're not in yours?</i>

1912
02:38:03,646 --> 02:38:04,781
Where are you, pup?

1913
02:38:25,667 --> 02:38:27,136
You're gonna die here.

1914
02:38:28,104 --> 02:38:30,504
Brave words, dear.

1915
02:38:31,307 --> 02:38:33,007
Is that what you really think?

1916
02:38:33,743 --> 02:38:36,113
You're gonna hurt me?

1917
02:38:36,500 --> 02:38:37,500
Yes.

1918
02:38:44,120 --> 02:38:45,196
You know,

1919
02:38:45,198 --> 02:38:46,898
you remind me of myself.

1920
02:38:48,958 --> 02:38:50,358
I can really see it now.

1921
02:38:51,360 --> 02:38:53,060
You've got a darkness in you dear.

1922
02:38:53,962 --> 02:38:56,662
I think the only difference
between you and me,

1923
02:38:56,692 --> 02:38:57,601
is time.

1924
02:39:06,976 --> 02:39:08,176
You don't know yet...

1925
02:39:09,245 --> 02:39:10,345
what you'd do...

1926
02:39:11,480 --> 02:39:12,580
for more time.

1927
02:39:14,249 --> 02:39:15,706
But I promise you dear.

1928
02:39:16,108 --> 02:39:17,808
Oh, you'd be surprised.

1929
02:39:23,192 --> 02:39:25,092
Pain purifies steam.

1930
02:39:26,194 --> 02:39:27,782
Fear too, so...

1931
02:39:28,184 --> 02:39:29,684
you understand.

1932
02:39:49,918 --> 02:39:52,218
I was just like you when I was younger.

1933
02:39:52,721 --> 02:39:54,089
I was special...

1934
02:39:55,057 --> 02:39:56,357
and alone.

1935
02:39:56,558 --> 02:39:59,770
But I met someone who gave me the
gift of purpose, of community.

1936
02:39:59,794 --> 02:40:01,594
And I might have given you
such a gift,

1937
02:40:01,830 --> 02:40:04,530
if things would have gone, differently.

1938
02:40:07,402 --> 02:40:08,402
No?

1939
02:40:09,704 --> 02:40:11,404
Defiant, aren't you?

1940
02:40:12,741 --> 02:40:14,151
So much like me.

1941
02:40:14,175 --> 02:40:17,075
Your mind is so...

1942
02:40:19,782 --> 02:40:21,832
This isn't your mind, is it?

1943
02:40:24,353 --> 02:40:25,953
This isn't you at all.

1944
02:40:28,324 --> 02:40:30,659
You're just the bait.

1945
02:40:34,130 --> 02:40:35,130
Enough!

1946
02:40:38,400 --> 02:40:39,400
Run.

1947
02:40:42,104 --> 02:40:44,204
How the hell did we miss you?

1948
02:40:47,409 --> 02:40:50,009
You and I should have met years ago.

1949
02:40:53,449 --> 02:40:54,449
Danny.

1950
02:40:55,684 --> 02:40:57,084
That's your name...

1951
02:40:57,500 --> 02:40:58,500
isn't it?

1952
02:40:59,721 --> 02:41:02,521
Well, something happens to the
steam when you rubes get older.

1953
02:41:03,225 --> 02:41:04,825
It gets polluted.

1954
02:41:05,393 --> 02:41:06,393
Dirty.

1955
02:41:07,129 --> 02:41:08,129
You know that.

1956
02:41:09,398 --> 02:41:11,598
I see the grease all over you.

1957
02:41:12,201 --> 02:41:14,601
You don't shine quite the same.

1958
02:41:15,203 --> 02:41:17,503
Growing up spoils that, I guess.

1959
02:41:19,841 --> 02:41:21,341
Seriously handsome,

1960
02:41:22,011 --> 02:41:24,611
where have you been hiding?

1961
02:41:27,600 --> 02:41:29,300
I can make you an offer.

1962
02:41:30,919 --> 02:41:32,519
An offer I rarely make.

1963
02:41:32,788 --> 02:41:33,569
Oh, yeah?

1964
02:41:33,871 --> 02:41:35,071
I can't wait.

1965
02:41:35,256 --> 02:41:36,856
Such a gifted boy...

1966
02:41:37,193 --> 02:41:39,893
hiding his light
under a bushel for so long.

1967
02:41:41,062 --> 02:41:44,262
You could live a long, long time.
Live well, too.

1968
02:41:45,468 --> 02:41:46,977
Indulge yourself,

1969
02:41:47,579 --> 02:41:49,079
no consequences,

1970
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:51,300
no hangovers.

1971
02:41:53,274 --> 02:41:54,639
Eat well,

1972
02:41:54,841 --> 02:41:55,941
live long.

1973
02:41:55,978 --> 02:41:57,278
You must be lonely,

1974
02:41:57,290 --> 02:41:58,790
being the last one.

1975
02:41:58,980 --> 02:42:00,780
I mean, the last one in the world.

1976
02:42:01,149 --> 02:42:03,449
Sweetie, I'm not the last.
Far from it.

1977
02:42:05,020 --> 02:42:06,520
I'm just the prettiest.

1978
02:42:06,800 --> 02:42:08,500
I assume you know my answer.

1979
02:42:10,425 --> 02:42:11,425
Pity.

1980
02:42:11,793 --> 02:42:13,193
So, are we doing this or not?

1981
02:42:34,049 --> 02:42:35,349
Oh, sweetie.

1982
02:42:36,017 --> 02:42:38,017
Oh, look at that?

1983
02:42:39,988 --> 02:42:43,288
I seem to have nicked
your femoral artery there.

1984
02:42:44,259 --> 02:42:45,859
Why, you're gonna bleed to death?

1985
02:42:52,434 --> 02:42:54,880
My, my, what a temper you have.

1986
02:42:54,904 --> 02:42:56,304
So much fire.

1987
02:42:56,437 --> 02:42:57,837
Such a waste!

1988
02:42:58,239 --> 02:42:59,639
Or maybe not.

1989
02:43:07,015 --> 02:43:08,115
Oh, damn.

1990
02:43:09,284 --> 02:43:10,684
Even at your age...

1991
02:43:11,854 --> 02:43:13,356
it's so good.

1992
02:43:18,560 --> 02:43:20,360
You taste like whiskey.

1993
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:27,103
Danny!

1994
02:43:28,137 --> 02:43:29,237
Danny boy!

1995
02:43:30,906 --> 02:43:33,006
Oh, so much terror.

1996
02:43:33,041 --> 02:43:34,641
All your life?

1997
02:43:37,345 --> 02:43:38,745
Delicious.

1998
02:43:45,120 --> 02:43:47,056
Don't hurt me!

1999
02:43:49,024 --> 02:43:50,024
Oh, damn.

2000
02:43:54,363 --> 02:43:56,041
What are...
You're not alone in there.

2001
02:43:58,300 --> 02:43:59,400
What are you hiding?

2002
02:44:02,036 --> 02:44:03,136
What's in those?

2003
02:44:03,571 --> 02:44:05,071
Something special?

2004
02:44:06,140 --> 02:44:07,252
They're not special.

2005
02:44:07,554 --> 02:44:08,854
They're starving.

2006
02:44:17,418 --> 02:44:18,418
No. No!

2007
02:44:19,121 --> 02:44:20,021
No!

2008
02:44:57,960 --> 02:44:59,860
Hello, Danny.

2009
02:45:01,997 --> 02:45:03,533
Come and play with us...

2010
02:45:05,334 --> 02:45:06,734
forever...

2011
02:45:07,668 --> 02:45:09,468
and ever...

2012
02:45:10,972 --> 02:45:12,372
and ever.

2013
02:45:47,008 --> 02:45:48,108
Uncle Dan.

2014
02:45:49,310 --> 02:45:51,010
Uncle Dan, is it done?

2015
02:45:51,212 --> 02:45:53,012
Is she dead?

2016
02:46:15,303 --> 02:46:17,103
Great party, isn't it?

2017
02:46:17,673 --> 02:46:18,773
Abra!

2018
02:46:22,777 --> 02:46:23,977
Abra!

2019
02:46:40,561 --> 02:46:41,761
Abra!

2020
02:46:48,302 --> 02:46:49,502
Abra!

2021
02:47:08,356 --> 02:47:09,356
Try it.

2022
02:47:12,427 --> 02:47:14,027
Oh, there you are.

2023
02:47:14,229 --> 02:47:15,229
Abra.

2024
02:47:16,497 --> 02:47:18,497
You've been very, very bad.

2025
02:47:19,267 --> 02:47:20,467
You're not Uncle Dan.

2026
02:47:21,436 --> 02:47:22,470
You're a mask.

2027
02:47:22,772 --> 02:47:24,172
A false face.

2028
02:47:25,706 --> 02:47:27,206
Who else would I be?

2029
02:47:27,241 --> 02:47:28,441
You're the hotel.

2030
02:47:28,877 --> 02:47:30,055
But he's still in there.

2031
02:47:30,379 --> 02:47:31,779
Mask is off, then.

2032
02:47:36,551 --> 02:47:38,251
Why are you smiling?

2033
02:47:38,620 --> 02:47:40,720
Because you don't know
where you're standing.

2034
02:47:42,190 --> 02:47:44,890
I know these halls
like my own face, child.

2035
02:47:45,094 --> 02:47:46,794
I mean the body you're standing in.

2036
02:47:47,129 --> 02:47:48,529
The face you're wearing.

2037
02:47:49,197 --> 02:47:50,997
That's Dan Torrance,
and you don't know him.

2038
02:47:51,100 --> 02:47:52,600
Dan Torrance.

2039
02:47:52,734 --> 02:47:53,925
Dan Torrance,

2040
02:47:54,400 --> 02:47:56,400
made one stop as soon as he got here.

2041
02:47:57,539 --> 02:47:58,739
To the boiler room.

2042
02:48:24,965 --> 02:48:26,065
There you are.

2043
02:48:27,535 --> 02:48:28,835
You were supposed to run.

2044
02:48:29,170 --> 02:48:30,610
I didn't wanna leave you.

2045
02:48:32,711 --> 02:48:33,511
Here I am.

2046
02:48:33,774 --> 02:48:35,614
I'm exactly where
I'm supposed to be.

2047
02:48:37,578 --> 02:48:40,078
I can't hold it off for much longer.
Abra, you need to run.

2048
02:48:40,300 --> 02:48:41,100
No!

2049
02:48:41,340 --> 02:48:42,940
I'm not going anywhere without you.

2050
02:48:43,352 --> 02:48:45,252
I have to close the door
behind us, right?

2051
02:48:46,622 --> 02:48:47,822
Run! Run!

2052
02:51:02,658 --> 02:51:03,658
Come on, Uncle Dan.

2053
02:51:04,326 --> 02:51:05,426
Get out of there.

2054
02:51:06,895 --> 02:51:07,997
Come on.

2055
02:51:19,740 --> 02:51:21,340
The fire spread fast,

2056
02:51:22,043 --> 02:51:23,643
destroying the hotel.

2057
02:51:24,045 --> 02:51:25,245
Purifying it.

2058
02:51:27,049 --> 02:51:28,449
I could almost hear it,

2059
02:51:29,084 --> 02:51:30,184
screaming.

2060
02:51:31,586 --> 02:51:32,886
I could hear it dying.

2061
02:51:34,355 --> 02:51:36,855
And deep inside, I knew...

2062
02:51:39,761 --> 02:51:41,161
I knew you were ok.

2063
02:51:42,963 --> 02:51:44,763
I'm sorry I put you in danger.

2064
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:47,300
It was the only way.

2065
02:51:48,470 --> 02:51:49,470
I know.

2066
02:51:50,806 --> 02:51:51,875
Do you think...

2067
02:51:52,377 --> 02:51:53,577
she was right,

2068
02:51:53,975 --> 02:51:55,975
when she said she wasn't the last one?

2069
02:51:57,379 --> 02:51:58,819
The world's a hungry place.

2070
02:51:59,648 --> 02:52:00,848
A dark place.

2071
02:52:02,351 --> 02:52:05,251
Maybe there is more of them
or things like them or worse but,

2072
02:52:05,953 --> 02:52:07,353
there are more people like you, too.

2073
02:52:08,622 --> 02:52:09,922
People who stand.

2074
02:52:13,828 --> 02:52:15,706
I told you when I first met you,

2075
02:52:15,707 --> 02:52:18,207
I told you, that you should hide.

2076
02:52:19,767 --> 02:52:21,667
That you should keep your head down.

2077
02:52:22,871 --> 02:52:24,571
Keep your shine out of sight.

2078
02:52:26,874 --> 02:52:27,974
But I was wrong.

2079
02:52:31,545 --> 02:52:33,145
Shine on, Abra Stone.

2080
02:52:36,417 --> 02:52:37,517
You shine on.

2081
02:52:41,288 --> 02:52:42,588
Dinner's ready.

2082
02:52:45,659 --> 02:52:46,859
Who are you talking to?

2083
02:52:49,398 --> 02:52:50,498
No one.

2084
02:52:58,706 --> 02:52:59,906
That's not true.

2085
02:53:04,078 --> 02:53:05,378
I was talking to Dan.

2086
02:53:13,454 --> 02:53:14,488
We go on,

2087
02:53:14,890 --> 02:53:15,890
after.

2088
02:53:16,490 --> 02:53:17,490
We go on.

2089
02:53:18,193 --> 02:53:19,393
And he's ok.

2090
02:53:20,694 --> 02:53:21,894
So is Daddy.

2091
02:53:23,097 --> 02:53:24,197
He really is.

2092
02:53:28,500 --> 02:53:29,500
Good.

2093
02:53:41,450 --> 02:53:42,750
You coming, sweetheart?

2094
02:53:45,487 --> 02:53:46,487
In a minute.

2095
02:54:07,676 --> 02:54:10,676
