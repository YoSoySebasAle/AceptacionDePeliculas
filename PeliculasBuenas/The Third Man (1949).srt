1
00:02:45,718 --> 00:02:47,740
I never knew
the old Vienna before the war

2
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,163
with its Strauss music,
its glamour and easy charm.

3
00:02:50,482 --> 00:02:52,806
Constantinople suited me better.

4
00:02:53,085 --> 00:02:56,789
I really got to know it in
the classic period of the black market.

5
00:02:56,889 --> 00:03:00,453
We'd run anything if people wanted it
enough and had the money to pay.

6
00:03:00,773 --> 00:03:03,355
Of course, a situation like that
does tempt amateurs.

7
00:03:03,455 --> 00:03:06,588
But, well, they, you know, they can't stay
the course like a professional.

8
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:09,762
Now the city, it's divided
into four zones, you know,

9
00:03:09,862 --> 00:03:13,726
each occupied by a power, the American,
the British, the Russian and the French.

10
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:15,808
But the centre of the city,
that's international,

11
00:03:15,908 --> 00:03:19,280
policed by an international patrol,
one member of each of the four powers.

12
00:03:19,512 --> 00:03:22,917
Wonderful. What a hope they had,
all strangers to the place,

13
00:03:23,076 --> 00:03:25,257
and none of them
could speak the same language,

14
00:03:25,357 --> 00:03:27,820
except a sort of smattering of German.

15
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:29,971
Good fellows, on the whole.
Did their best, you know.

16
00:03:30,482 --> 00:03:33,809
Vienna doesn't really look any worse
than a lot of other European cities.

17
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,128
Bombed about a bit.

18
00:03:35,528 --> 00:03:38,310
Oh, I was gonna tell you. Wait.
I was gonna tell you about Holly Martins,

19
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:41,474
an American, came all the way
here to visit a friend of his.

20
00:03:41,575 --> 00:03:43,356
The name was Lime. Harry Lime.

21
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,061
Now, Martins was broke,
and Lime had offered him

22
00:03:45,178 --> 00:03:47,039
some sort, I don't know,
some sort of a job.

23
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:51,115
Anyway, there he was, poor chap,
happy as a lark and without a cent.

24
00:04:02,996 --> 00:04:04,818
- Passport, please.
- Oh.

25
00:04:04,918 --> 00:04:07,901
- What's the purpose of your visit here?
- Friend of mine offered me a job here.

26
00:04:08,001 --> 00:04:10,544
- Where are you staying?
- With him. 15 Stiftgasse.

27
00:04:10,644 --> 00:04:12,853
- His name?
- Lime. Harry Lime.

28
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,250
- Okay.
- Thought he'd be here to meet me.

29
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:55,660
- Speak English?
- English?

30
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,424
Uh...

31
00:04:58,452 --> 00:05:00,024
Little. Little.

32
00:05:03,818 --> 00:05:06,870
Uh, 10 minutes too late.

33
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,833
- Already gone.
- Who?

34
00:05:09,263 --> 00:05:12,887
Um, his friends and the, uh... no.

35
00:05:12,987 --> 00:05:15,960
- Uh, coffin.
- Coffin?

36
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,074
Mr Lime's. An accident.

37
00:05:18,353 --> 00:05:22,078
Knocked over by a car,
here in front of the house.

38
00:05:23,118 --> 00:05:26,408
Have seen it myself.
Killed at once, immediately.

39
00:05:26,521 --> 00:05:28,731
Already in hell,

40
00:05:29,604 --> 00:05:31,050
or in heaven.

41
00:05:31,887 --> 00:05:35,975
Sorry for the gravediggers.
Hard work. It is frost.

42
00:05:47,543 --> 00:05:51,028
Can you tell me, uh... who's the...

43
00:05:51,546 --> 00:05:53,038
A fellow called Lime.

44
00:07:21,157 --> 00:07:22,205
Like a lift to town?

45
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,693
I've got a car here.

46
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,781
Thanks.

47
00:07:42,299 --> 00:07:45,042
- My name's Calloway.
- Martins.

48
00:07:45,142 --> 00:07:47,146
- You a friend of Lime?
- Yeah.

49
00:07:48,305 --> 00:07:50,388
- Been here long?
- No.

50
00:08:00,518 --> 00:08:04,261
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you?
You could do with a drink.

51
00:08:04,361 --> 00:08:05,853
Could you buy me one?
I haven't got any Austrian...

52
00:08:05,962 --> 00:08:06,944
- Of course.
- Thanks.

53
00:08:07,044 --> 00:08:08,046
Schmolka.

54
00:08:08,886 --> 00:08:11,620
I guess nobody knew Harry like he did.

55
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:15,058
- Like I did.
- How long ago?

56
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:17,660
Back in school.

57
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:21,118
I was never so lonesome
in my life till he showed up.

58
00:08:21,218 --> 00:08:23,872
- When did you see him last?
- September '39.

59
00:08:24,622 --> 00:08:26,124
- When the business started?
- Mmm-hmm.

60
00:08:26,224 --> 00:08:28,274
- See much of him before that?
- Once in a while.

61
00:08:29,147 --> 00:08:32,120
- Best friend I ever had.
- That sounds like a cheap novelette.

62
00:08:36,114 --> 00:08:37,526
I write cheap novelettes.

63
00:08:37,716 --> 00:08:40,609
I'm afraid I've never heard of you.
What's your name again?

64
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,087
- Holly Martins.
- No, sorry.

65
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:46,614
You ever hear of The Lone Rider
of Santa Fe?

66
00:08:46,725 --> 00:08:48,547
Can't say that I have.

67
00:08:48,647 --> 00:08:51,892
- Death at Double-X Ranch?
- Uh... "Ranch."

68
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:54,492
- Nope.
- Hmm.

69
00:08:55,093 --> 00:08:58,676
He must've known I was broke.
He even sent me an aeroplane ticket.

70
00:08:58,777 --> 00:09:01,225
- It's a shame.
- What?

71
00:09:02,621 --> 00:09:04,385
Him dying like that.

72
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:05,955
Best thing that ever happened to him.

73
00:09:08,066 --> 00:09:09,447
What are you trying to say?

74
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:12,440
He was about the worst racketeer
that ever made a dirty living in this city.

75
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:15,638
- Policeman, huh?
- Come on, have another drink.

76
00:09:15,754 --> 00:09:19,297
No, I never did like policemen.
I have to call them sheriffs.

77
00:09:19,397 --> 00:09:22,290
- Ever seen one?
- Pin it on a dead man.

78
00:09:22,641 --> 00:09:26,571
Some petty racket
with gasoline or something.

79
00:09:27,766 --> 00:09:30,789
Just like a cop.
You're a real cop, I suppose.

80
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:33,578
- It wasn't petrol.
- So it wasn't petrol.

81
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:37,396
So it was tyres or saccharin or...

82
00:09:37,496 --> 00:09:40,199
Why don't you catch
a few murderers for a change?

83
00:09:40,299 --> 00:09:43,306
Well, you could say that murder
was part of his racket.

84
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:49,167
It's all right, Paine. He's only
a scribbler with too much drink in him.

85
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:51,431
Take Mr Holly Martins home.

86
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:55,916
Holly Martins, sir?
The, uh... the writer?

87
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,401
The author of Death at Double-X Ranch?

88
00:09:58,518 --> 00:10:01,140
- Listen, Callaghan...
- Calloway. I'm English, not Irish.

89
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,822
You're not going to close your
files at a dead man's expense.

90
00:10:03,922 --> 00:10:07,507
So you're going to find me the real criminal?
Sounds like one of your stories.

91
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:10,590
When I'm finished with you,
you'll leave Vienna, you'll look so silly.

92
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,913
Here's some army money. It should see
you through tonight at Sacher's Hotel,

93
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,835
if you don't drink too much in the bar.

94
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,939
We'll keep a seat for you
on tomorrow's plane.

95
00:10:22,902 --> 00:10:25,795
Please be careful, sir. Up we come.

96
00:10:27,867 --> 00:10:29,792
- Written anything lately?
- Take him to Sacher's.

97
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:32,291
Don't hit him again if he behaves.

98
00:10:32,391 --> 00:10:34,894
And you go carefully there.
It's a military hotel.

99
00:10:34,994 --> 00:10:38,526
I'm so glad to have met you, sir.
I've read quite a few of your books.

100
00:10:40,447 --> 00:10:41,764
I like a good western.

101
00:10:42,402 --> 00:10:43,743
That's what I like about them, sir.

102
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,785
You can pick them up
and put them down anytime.

103
00:10:45,885 --> 00:10:47,012
- Oh, Mr Hardtmuth.
- Yes, sir?

104
00:10:47,127 --> 00:10:49,349
Major Calloway said this gentleman's
gotta have a room for the night.

105
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:51,579
- He'll be off tomorrow.
- Passport, please.

106
00:10:52,412 --> 00:10:54,895
Can't very well introduce you
to everybody.

107
00:10:56,536 --> 00:10:58,347
Would you mind filling this in?

108
00:10:59,219 --> 00:11:00,841
- Mr Crabbin.
- What is it, Sergeant?

109
00:11:00,941 --> 00:11:02,361
- Mr Holly Martins, sir.
- Who?

110
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:05,164
- The author. Thought you might be interested.
- Never heard of him.

111
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,487
He's very good, sir.
I've read quite a few of his books.

112
00:11:07,588 --> 00:11:11,277
Have you, Sergeant? Author? Martins?
Thank you, Sergeant.

113
00:11:12,553 --> 00:11:15,255
Mr Martins? My name's Crabbin.

114
00:11:15,355 --> 00:11:17,578
I represent the CRS of GHQ.

115
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:20,941
- You do?
- Yes. Cultural Re-education Section.

116
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:23,263
Uh, propaganda. Very important
in a place like this.

117
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:26,186
We do a little show each week.
Last week we had Hamlet.

118
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:29,931
- The week before we had, um, something.
- The striptease, sir.

119
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,100
Yes, the Hindu dancers.
Thank you, Sergeant.

120
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:35,156
This is the first opportunity we've had
of making an American author welcome.

121
00:11:35,256 --> 00:11:37,101
- Welcome?
- Now, I'll tell you what, Mr Martins.

122
00:11:37,218 --> 00:11:38,599
On Wednesday night, at our institute,

123
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:41,762
we're having a little lecture
on a contemporary novel.

124
00:11:41,863 --> 00:11:44,284
- Thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
- They wouldn't know me.

125
00:11:44,384 --> 00:11:47,247
Oh, nonsense. Your novels are very
popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?

126
00:11:47,347 --> 00:11:50,572
- Very popular, sir.
- Very popular. Are you staying long?

127
00:11:50,672 --> 00:11:53,735
How long can one stay here
on this stage money?

128
00:11:53,835 --> 00:11:56,658
Listen, Mr Martins,
if you'd agree to be our guest,

129
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:59,047
we'd be delighted to have you.

130
00:12:00,481 --> 00:12:01,983
- Would you?
- As long as you care to stay.

131
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:03,704
But he's due to leave tomorrow, sir.

132
00:12:03,804 --> 00:12:05,251
Excuse me. Have you got a toothache?

133
00:12:05,446 --> 00:12:07,869
- Number 8, Mr Martins.
- Come upstairs a moment.

134
00:12:07,969 --> 00:12:09,911
- I know a very good dentist.
- I don't need a dentist.

135
00:12:10,011 --> 00:12:11,272
Somebody hit me, that's all.

136
00:12:11,372 --> 00:12:14,345
Goodness. We must report that to the police.
Were they trying to rob you?

137
00:12:14,455 --> 00:12:16,958
Oh, just a soldier. I was trying
to punch his major in the eye.

138
00:12:17,058 --> 00:12:19,841
- No. A major? Were you really?
- Heard of Harry Lime?

139
00:12:19,941 --> 00:12:22,003
Well, I've heard of him, of course,
but I didn't exactly know him.

140
00:12:22,104 --> 00:12:24,365
I was going to stay with him,
but he died Thursday.

141
00:12:24,465 --> 00:12:25,727
Goodness, that's awkward.

142
00:12:25,827 --> 00:12:27,408
That what you say to people after death?

143
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:28,610
"Goodness, that's awkward"?

144
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,158
Mr Martins. Excuse me. Telephone.

145
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:34,445
- Who is it?
- Baron Kurtz.

146
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,168
Must be some mistake. Yes?

147
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,741
I was a friend of Harry Lime.

148
00:12:39,841 --> 00:12:43,024
I'd very much like to meet you, Baron.
Come around.

149
00:12:43,124 --> 00:12:45,387
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel.

150
00:12:45,487 --> 00:12:48,230
- Couldn't we meet at the Mozart Cafe?
- Where?

151
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,018
- Just around the corner.
- How will I know you?

152
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:55,423
I'll carry a copy of one of your books.
Harry gave it to me.

153
00:12:56,018 --> 00:12:58,439
Be there in a moment. Wait a minute.

154
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,923
If I do this lecture business,
you'll put me up here a while?

155
00:13:01,023 --> 00:13:02,845
- Certainly.
- It's a deal.

156
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:05,447
You ever read a book of mine called
The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?

157
00:13:05,548 --> 00:13:06,569
No, not that one, sir.

158
00:13:06,669 --> 00:13:08,090
It's a story about a man
who hunted down a sheriff

159
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,732
who was victimizing his best friend.

160
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:11,413
- Seems exciting.
- It is.

161
00:13:11,514 --> 00:13:14,486
I'm gunning just the same way
for your Major Callaghan.

162
00:13:14,997 --> 00:13:16,603
Sounds anti-British, sir.

163
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:33,302
- Baron Kurtz?
- Mr Martins?

164
00:13:33,455 --> 00:13:36,622
Delighted to meet you.
Come, let's sit down here.

165
00:13:39,062 --> 00:13:41,725
- What would you like? Tea? Coffee?
- Coffee.

166
00:13:44,386 --> 00:13:46,690
It's wonderful how you keep the tension.

167
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,475
- Tension?
- Suspense.

168
00:13:48,672 --> 00:13:49,772
You really liked it?

169
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:51,854
At the end of every chapter
you are left guessing

170
00:13:51,954 --> 00:13:53,055
what he'll be up to next.

171
00:13:53,156 --> 00:13:55,338
So, you were a friend of Harry's?

172
00:13:55,438 --> 00:13:58,251
I think his best. Except you, of course.

173
00:13:59,122 --> 00:14:02,652
The police have a crazy notion that
he was mixed up in some sort of a racket.

174
00:14:03,887 --> 00:14:08,418
Everyone in Vienna is. We all sell
cigarettes and that kind of thing.

175
00:14:09,492 --> 00:14:14,458
I tell you, I've done things that would
have seemed unthinkable before the war.

176
00:14:15,018 --> 00:14:18,993
Once when I was hard up,
I sold some tyres on the black market.

177
00:14:20,063 --> 00:14:21,925
I wonder what my father would have said.

178
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:23,836
I'm afraid the police meant
more than that.

179
00:14:24,027 --> 00:14:27,273
They get rather absurd ideas sometimes.

180
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,453
He's somewhere now
he won't mind about that.

181
00:14:30,554 --> 00:14:32,957
Even so, I'm not going
to leave it at this.

182
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:34,959
Will you help me?

183
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,492
I wish I could.

184
00:14:39,203 --> 00:14:41,905
But, you know, I am an Austrian.

185
00:14:42,005 --> 00:14:44,408
I have to be careful with the police.

186
00:14:44,848 --> 00:14:47,138
I'm afraid I can't help you.

187
00:14:48,052 --> 00:14:50,294
Except with advice, of course.

188
00:14:51,374 --> 00:14:52,582
Advice.

189
00:14:54,579 --> 00:14:57,120
We came out of his place like this,

190
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,304
and were walking this way.

191
00:14:59,984 --> 00:15:02,877
A friend of his called to him
from over there.

192
00:15:03,146 --> 00:15:07,156
Harry went across,
and from up there came the truck.

193
00:15:08,593 --> 00:15:10,518
It was just about here.

194
00:15:12,276 --> 00:15:13,324
Here?

195
00:15:13,918 --> 00:15:15,205
Yes.

196
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,043
His friend and I picked him up.

197
00:15:19,163 --> 00:15:21,851
Carried him across over here.

198
00:15:23,447 --> 00:15:25,976
It was a terrible thing. Terrible.

199
00:15:27,532 --> 00:15:30,424
We laid him down just about here.

200
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:35,119
And this is where he died.

201
00:15:35,219 --> 00:15:37,303
Even at the end,
his thoughts were of you.

202
00:15:37,823 --> 00:15:38,825
What did he say?

203
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:42,608
I can't remember the exact words, Holly.

204
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,770
I may call you Holly, mayn't I?
He always called you that to us.

205
00:15:46,951 --> 00:15:49,494
He was anxious I should
look after you when you arrived,

206
00:15:49,595 --> 00:15:53,458
to see that you got safely home,
tickets, you know, and all that.

207
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:55,324
But you said he died instantaneously.

208
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,812
Well, he died before
the ambulance could reach us.

209
00:16:02,327 --> 00:16:04,830
Well, there was only you and this, uh...

210
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,552
this friend of his. Uh, who was he?

211
00:16:06,652 --> 00:16:08,954
A Romanian. Mr Popescu.

212
00:16:09,054 --> 00:16:10,136
I'd like to talk to him.

213
00:16:10,294 --> 00:16:12,265
He has left Vienna.

214
00:16:17,503 --> 00:16:19,746
- Uh, excuse me.
- Yes?

215
00:16:21,226 --> 00:16:24,169
- Did you know Mr Lime well?
- Mr Lime? Yes.

216
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:26,878
- You remember me. Upstairs.
- Yes, I remember you.

217
00:16:27,312 --> 00:16:29,237
Who used to visit Mr Lime?

218
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,686
Visit? Eh...

219
00:16:42,287 --> 00:16:45,230
- What did he say?
- He says he doesn't know everybody.

220
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,503
Excuse me.

221
00:16:59,345 --> 00:17:01,207
Who was at the funeral besides you?

222
00:17:01,307 --> 00:17:03,129
Only his doctor, Dr Winkel.

223
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:04,596
Wasn't there a girl there?

224
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,881
Some girl of the Josefstadt Theatre.
You know what Harry was.

225
00:17:10,316 --> 00:17:13,402
You oughtn't to speak to her.
It would only cause her pain.

226
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,807
Not necessarily.
She'd probably want to help.

227
00:17:17,402 --> 00:17:19,746
What's the good of another post-mortem?

228
00:17:19,846 --> 00:17:23,536
Suppose you dig up something,
well, discreditable to Harry?

229
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:27,456
- Would you give me your address?
- I live in the Russian sector.

230
00:17:27,574 --> 00:17:30,276
But you'll find me at
the Casanova Club every night.

231
00:17:30,376 --> 00:17:32,559
One has to work the best way one can,
you know.

232
00:17:32,659 --> 00:17:35,522
- What's the name of this girl?
- I don't know.

233
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:37,113
I don't think I ever heard it.

234
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:39,076
You did mention the theatre.

235
00:17:40,548 --> 00:17:41,993
Josefstadt.

236
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:45,402
But I still think it won't do
Harry any good.

237
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:49,469
You'd do better to think of yourself.

238
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,758
I'll be all right.

239
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:55,286
Of course. I'm so glad I've met you.

240
00:17:55,481 --> 00:17:59,127
A master of suspense!
Such a good cover, I think.

241
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,311
- Number 8, please.
- Major Calloway's compliments, sir.

242
00:18:05,412 --> 00:18:08,636
- Here's the ticket for the plane tomorrow.
- You tell the major I won't need it.

243
00:18:08,736 --> 00:18:11,958
Oh, porter, order me a ticket tonight
for the Josefstadt Theatre.

244
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:13,800
- Ah, Mr Martins.
- Good evening, Mr Crabbin.

245
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,202
He said I was to drive you
to the airfield,

246
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,044
or take you to the bus, sir.
Whichever you prefer.

247
00:18:17,144 --> 00:18:21,312
Didn't you hear Mr Crabbin offer me
the hospitality of the HQ BMT?

248
00:19:14,683 --> 00:19:17,370
I was a friend of Harry Lime.

249
00:19:21,248 --> 00:19:22,631
Afterwards.

250
00:19:42,991 --> 00:19:44,802
Uh, Miss Schmidt?

251
00:19:45,994 --> 00:19:47,295
Oh, come in.

252
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,857
- Thank you.
- Sit down.

253
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,780
Thank you. I enjoyed the play very much.
Excuse me.

254
00:19:53,682 --> 00:19:55,785
You were... You were awfully good.

255
00:19:55,885 --> 00:19:57,065
Do you understand German?

256
00:19:57,165 --> 00:20:00,870
No. Excuse me.
I could follow it fine.

257
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,792
- Oh, yes.
- Perhaps Harry told you about me.

258
00:20:02,892 --> 00:20:04,544
My name is Holly Martins.

259
00:20:05,213 --> 00:20:07,236
- No, he never told me about his friends.
- Oh.

260
00:20:07,336 --> 00:20:08,718
- Would you like some tea?
- Thank you.

261
00:20:08,818 --> 00:20:10,679
Someone threw me this packet last week.

262
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:14,163
Sometimes the British do instead
of flowers, you know, on the first night.

263
00:20:14,263 --> 00:20:17,366
That was a bouquet, too, from an American.
Would you rather have whisky?

264
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,593
Oh, tea's fine.

265
00:20:19,268 --> 00:20:21,113
Good. I wanted to sell it.

266
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:25,241
- Oh, there is some tea left.
- Had you known him some time?

267
00:20:27,757 --> 00:20:30,499
- Yes.
- I wanted to talk to you. No, thank you.

268
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,444
I wanted to talk to you about him.

269
00:20:32,922 --> 00:20:36,425
There's nothing really to talk about,
is there? Nothing.

270
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:39,612
Well, I saw you at the funeral.

271
00:20:40,329 --> 00:20:42,619
I'm so sorry. I didn't notice much.

272
00:20:44,855 --> 00:20:47,236
You were in love with him, weren't you?

273
00:20:47,336 --> 00:20:48,863
I don't know.

274
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:52,362
How can you know
a thing like that afterwards?

275
00:20:52,462 --> 00:20:56,145
I don't know anything any more,
except I want to be dead, too.

276
00:20:56,757 --> 00:20:58,170
Some more tea?

277
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,116
No. No tea.

278
00:21:01,031 --> 00:21:02,602
Would you like a cigarette?

279
00:21:03,273 --> 00:21:05,215
Oh, American. Thank you. I like them.

280
00:21:05,315 --> 00:21:09,005
I was talking to another friend
of Harry's, a Baron Kurtz.

281
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,805
- Do you know him?
- No.

282
00:21:12,002 --> 00:21:14,531
- He's got a little dog.
- Oh, yes, yes.

283
00:21:15,325 --> 00:21:17,588
Don't understand what Harry saw
in a fellow like that.

284
00:21:17,688 --> 00:21:21,093
That was the man who brought me
some money when Harry died.

285
00:21:21,331 --> 00:21:23,554
He said Harry had been
anxious at the last moment.

286
00:21:23,654 --> 00:21:26,820
Hmm. He said he remembered me, too.

287
00:21:27,377 --> 00:21:30,200
Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.

288
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,145
Dr Winkel told me that.

289
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,786
Dr Winkel? Who's he?

290
00:21:35,546 --> 00:21:39,521
A doctor Harry used to go to.
He was passing just after it happened.

291
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:42,041
- His own doctor?
- Yes.

292
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:46,137
Well, were you at the inquest?

293
00:21:46,237 --> 00:21:48,719
Yes. They said it wasn't
the driver's fault.

294
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,943
Harry had often said what
a careful driver he was.

295
00:21:52,043 --> 00:21:54,445
- He was Harry's driver?
- Mmm-hmm.

296
00:21:55,085 --> 00:21:58,572
Well, uh... I don't get it.

297
00:21:59,691 --> 00:22:04,195
All of them there!
Uh, Kurtz, this Romanian, uh... Popescu,

298
00:22:04,295 --> 00:22:06,237
his own driver knocking him over,

299
00:22:06,337 --> 00:22:08,467
his own doctor just passing by.

300
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,342
No strangers there at all.

301
00:22:11,142 --> 00:22:13,564
I know.
I've wondered about it 100 times,

302
00:22:13,664 --> 00:22:15,031
if it really was an accident.

303
00:22:21,431 --> 00:22:23,676
What difference does it make?
He's dead, isn't he?

304
00:22:24,075 --> 00:22:25,761
- But if it wasn't an...
- Fräulein Schmidt.

305
00:22:30,161 --> 00:22:32,245
I must hurry.
They don't like us to use the lights.

306
00:22:32,965 --> 00:22:35,573
- The porter saw it happen.
- Then why worry?

307
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:40,256
Look, do you know that porter?

308
00:22:43,174 --> 00:22:44,256
Yes.

309
00:22:51,142 --> 00:22:53,605
- What's he saying?
- He says it happened right down there.

310
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,208
Happened, yes.
Happened right down there.

311
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,962
- You saw it?
- Well, not saw, heard.

312
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:02,614
Heard. I heard the brakes.

313
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:06,257
And I got to the window and saw them
carry the body to the other side,

314
00:23:06,357 --> 00:23:09,969
uh... of the Josef, the Josef...

315
00:23:10,402 --> 00:23:12,384
Emperor Josef statue.

316
00:23:12,757 --> 00:23:14,348
Why didn't they bring him in the house?

317
00:23:39,792 --> 00:23:42,294
- Could he have been conscious?
- Conscious?

318
00:23:45,456 --> 00:23:46,768
Uh, was he still alive?

319
00:23:47,239 --> 00:23:50,462
Ah, alive! He couldn't have been alive,

320
00:23:50,563 --> 00:23:53,375
not with his head in the way it was.

321
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:55,817
I was told that he did not die at once.

322
00:23:58,411 --> 00:23:59,513
No, I mean that...

323
00:24:02,215 --> 00:24:03,418
No, you...

324
00:24:08,982 --> 00:24:12,068
- He was quite dead.
- He was... Oh, yeah. He was quite dead.

325
00:24:13,066 --> 00:24:14,477
He was quite dead.

326
00:24:14,988 --> 00:24:16,690
But this sounds crazy.

327
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,772
If he was killed at once,
how could he have talked about me

328
00:24:18,872 --> 00:24:20,842
and this lady here after he was dead?

329
00:24:21,354 --> 00:24:22,881
Why didn't you say
all this at the inquest?

330
00:24:23,436 --> 00:24:27,685
Uh, it's better not to be
mixed up in things like this.

331
00:24:27,961 --> 00:24:29,202
Things like what?

332
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:35,468
I was not the only one
who did not give evidence.

333
00:24:35,569 --> 00:24:37,190
Who else?

334
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:40,281
Three men helped to carry
your friend to the statue.

335
00:24:40,381 --> 00:24:41,423
- Kurtz?
- Yes.

336
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:42,796
- The Romanian?
- Yes.

337
00:24:42,896 --> 00:24:45,158
- And?
- There was a third man.

338
00:24:45,258 --> 00:24:46,360
He didn't give evidence.

339
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,401
- You don't mean the doctor?
- No, no, no.

340
00:24:48,502 --> 00:24:52,245
He came later, after they carried him
to the Josef statue.

341
00:24:52,345 --> 00:24:53,427
What did this man look like?

342
00:24:54,989 --> 00:24:56,594
I didn't see his face.

343
00:24:59,633 --> 00:25:02,161
He didn't look up. He was, uh...

344
00:25:02,757 --> 00:25:05,284
quite, uh... gewöhnlich, ordinary.

345
00:25:05,999 --> 00:25:09,131
He... He might have been

346
00:25:09,724 --> 00:25:11,215
just anybody.

347
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,379
Just anybody.

348
00:25:18,452 --> 00:25:20,616
Hello? Hello.

349
00:25:23,698 --> 00:25:24,860
Hello.

350
00:25:30,585 --> 00:25:31,747
Hello?

351
00:25:34,242 --> 00:25:35,329
Who was that?

352
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:37,852
I don't know. They didn't answer.

353
00:25:37,952 --> 00:25:39,956
But I was told
there were only two men there.

354
00:25:40,234 --> 00:25:42,456
You've got to tell your story
to the police.

355
00:25:42,557 --> 00:25:44,258
The police? Why police?

356
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:49,303
It's nonsense! It is all nonsense!
It was an accident.

357
00:25:49,403 --> 00:25:50,975
You don't know it was an accident.

358
00:25:51,085 --> 00:25:53,027
You only saw a dead man
with three men carrying him.

359
00:25:54,729 --> 00:25:56,591
I should have listened to my wife.

360
00:25:56,691 --> 00:25:59,274
She said you were up to no good. Gossip.

361
00:25:59,374 --> 00:26:01,035
Suppose I take your evidence
to the police?

362
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:05,319
Now, hold on.

363
00:26:11,707 --> 00:26:14,998
I have no evidence.
I saw nothing, I said nothing.

364
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,113
- It's not my business.
- Well, make it your business.

365
00:26:19,595 --> 00:26:21,135
Hold on.

366
00:26:26,522 --> 00:26:30,425
I have always liked you,
but you must not bring this gentleman again.

367
00:26:30,526 --> 00:26:32,427
You must go at once, please. Please!

368
00:26:34,409 --> 00:26:35,411
Please!

369
00:26:43,098 --> 00:26:44,989
You shouldn't get mixed up in this.

370
00:26:46,461 --> 00:26:49,708
Well, if I do find out something,
can I look you up again?

371
00:26:50,546 --> 00:26:52,528
Why don't you leave this town? Go home.

372
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:04,057
What is it?

373
00:27:12,902 --> 00:27:14,230
What's she talking about?

374
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,112
The police. They are searching my room.

375
00:27:46,644 --> 00:27:49,425
- What the devil?
- Getting around, Martins?

376
00:27:49,527 --> 00:27:52,099
Oh, pinning things on girls now.

377
00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:54,533
Miss Schmidt, I should like
to see your papers, please.

378
00:27:55,171 --> 00:27:57,096
Don't you give him anything.

379
00:27:59,256 --> 00:28:00,496
Thank you.

380
00:28:02,378 --> 00:28:04,962
You were born
in Graz of Austrian parents?

381
00:28:05,546 --> 00:28:06,553
Yes.

382
00:28:08,424 --> 00:28:09,952
Paine.

383
00:28:17,555 --> 00:28:18,966
Hmm.

384
00:28:25,202 --> 00:28:27,606
It's very good, sir, isn't it, eh?

385
00:28:28,342 --> 00:28:29,988
How much did you pay for this?

386
00:28:32,329 --> 00:28:34,632
I'm afraid I shall have to keep
this for a while, Miss Schmidt.

387
00:28:34,732 --> 00:28:36,554
How do you expect her to live
in this city without her papers?

388
00:28:36,654 --> 00:28:38,235
Write her out a receipt, Paine.

389
00:28:38,335 --> 00:28:41,238
- And give her a receipt for those letters, too.
- This way, miss.

390
00:28:41,338 --> 00:28:44,441
I suppose it wouldn't interest you
to know that Harry Lime was murdered.

391
00:28:44,542 --> 00:28:47,116
You're too busy. You haven't even
bothered to get the complete evidence.

392
00:28:55,272 --> 00:28:57,926
- Must you take those?
- They'll be returned, miss.

393
00:28:59,436 --> 00:29:01,247
They are private letters.

394
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:03,741
That's all right, miss. Don't worry.

395
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:06,130
We're used to it. Like doctors.

396
00:29:06,804 --> 00:29:10,348
There was a third man there. I suppose
that doesn't sound peculiar to you.

397
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,911
I'm not interested in whether
a racketeer like Lime

398
00:29:13,011 --> 00:29:15,472
was killed by his friends
or by an accident.

399
00:29:15,573 --> 00:29:17,543
The only important thing
is that he's dead.

400
00:29:19,416 --> 00:29:22,504
- I'm sorry.
- Tactful, too, aren't we, Callaghan?

401
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:24,683
- Calloway.
- Must you take those letters?

402
00:29:24,783 --> 00:29:27,365
- Yes, I'm afraid so.
- They're Harry's.

403
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:30,871
- That's the reason.
- You won't learn anything from them.

404
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:35,373
They're only love letters.
There are not many of them.

405
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:38,537
They'll be returned to you, Miss Schmidt,
as soon as they've been examined.

406
00:29:38,637 --> 00:29:41,723
There's nothing in them.
Harry never did anything.

407
00:29:43,441 --> 00:29:45,573
Only a small thing once,
out of kindness.

408
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,290
And what was that?

409
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:49,978
You've got it in your hand.

410
00:29:50,849 --> 00:29:52,376
Major Calloway.

411
00:29:52,651 --> 00:29:54,735
- Finished?
- Yes. Okay.

412
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,741
You will have to come
with us, Miss Schmidt.

413
00:29:58,857 --> 00:30:00,278
You're not locking her up.

414
00:30:00,378 --> 00:30:01,961
Go home, Martins,
like a sensible chap.

415
00:30:02,061 --> 00:30:04,224
You don't know what you're mixing in.
Get the next plane.

416
00:30:04,342 --> 00:30:06,565
As soon as I get to the bottom of this,
I'll get the next plane.

417
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:09,447
Death's at the bottom of everything, Martins.
Leave death to the professionals.

418
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:11,410
Mind if I use that line
in my next western?

419
00:30:11,511 --> 00:30:13,452
You can't chuck me out.
My papers are in order.

420
00:30:13,553 --> 00:30:15,734
Here we are, miss.
Your receipt for the letters.

421
00:30:15,834 --> 00:30:17,326
I don't want it.

422
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:20,440
Well, I've got it
when you want it, miss.

423
00:30:24,003 --> 00:30:26,212
Anything really wrong with your papers?

424
00:30:29,729 --> 00:30:31,255
They're forged.

425
00:30:32,251 --> 00:30:33,743
Oh.

426
00:30:34,774 --> 00:30:36,186
Why?

427
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,999
The Russians would claim me.
I come from Czechoslovakia.

428
00:31:03,927 --> 00:31:05,585
What's she saying?

429
00:31:05,685 --> 00:31:07,827
Only complaining about the way
they behave in her house.

430
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:14,104
Give her some cigarettes.

431
00:31:16,657 --> 00:31:19,078
- Uh, cigarettes, hmm?
- Danke.

432
00:31:24,745 --> 00:31:26,511
Miss Schmidt, ready?

433
00:31:28,108 --> 00:31:29,635
Now, look,

434
00:31:29,909 --> 00:31:33,885
I'll, uh... straighten out
all this nonsense about Harry.

435
00:31:35,916 --> 00:31:37,681
You'll be all right.

436
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,124
Sometimes he said I laughed too much.

437
00:31:46,206 --> 00:31:48,669
Oh, what's the name of that doctor?
Harry's doctor?

438
00:31:48,769 --> 00:31:52,744
- Dr Winkel.
- What do you want to see a doctor for? Hmm?

439
00:31:53,134 --> 00:31:55,195
- A bruised lip.
- Good.

440
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:12,353
Laboratory,
we're coming right down.

441
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,891
You wait here, Miss Schmidt.

442
00:32:55,236 --> 00:32:56,642
Is Dr Winkel in?

443
00:32:58,119 --> 00:33:00,982
- Dr Winkel. I'm sorry. I don't speak German.
- Nein.

444
00:33:01,082 --> 00:33:05,410
Please, won't you say that
I'm a friend of Harry Lime?

445
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:10,720
Thank you.

446
00:33:27,789 --> 00:33:30,492
- Dr Winkel?
- "Winkel."

447
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:32,518
Uh, Dr Winkel.

448
00:33:33,796 --> 00:33:36,404
Quite a collection of, uh... collection.

449
00:33:36,518 --> 00:33:38,683
Yes.

450
00:33:43,142 --> 00:33:44,297
Come, come, come...

451
00:33:49,913 --> 00:33:51,219
Is that your dog?

452
00:33:51,814 --> 00:33:53,917
Yes. Would you mind, Mr, uh...

453
00:33:54,017 --> 00:33:56,464
- Martins.
- Martins, coming to the point, please?

454
00:33:56,579 --> 00:33:58,469
- Thank you.
- I have guests waiting.

455
00:33:58,581 --> 00:34:02,305
- We were both friends of Harry Lime.
- I was his medical adviser.

456
00:34:02,865 --> 00:34:04,277
I want to find out all I can.

457
00:34:04,747 --> 00:34:07,089
- Find out?
- Hear the details.

458
00:34:07,189 --> 00:34:08,891
I can tell you very little.

459
00:34:08,991 --> 00:34:12,636
He was run over by a car.
He was dead when I arrived.

460
00:34:13,048 --> 00:34:14,118
Who was with him?

461
00:34:14,957 --> 00:34:16,404
Two friends of his.

462
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,244
You sure? Two?

463
00:34:19,923 --> 00:34:21,413
Quite sure.

464
00:34:22,726 --> 00:34:24,908
Could he have been at all conscious?

465
00:34:25,008 --> 00:34:28,752
I understand he was, yes,
for a short time,

466
00:34:28,852 --> 00:34:30,874
while they carried him across the road.

467
00:34:30,974 --> 00:34:34,186
- In great pain?
- Mmm, not necessarily.

468
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:38,121
Could he have been capable
of making plans,

469
00:34:38,221 --> 00:34:41,832
for me and others just...
Just during those few moments?

470
00:34:42,345 --> 00:34:44,848
I understand he left some
instructions before he died.

471
00:34:44,948 --> 00:34:47,351
I cannot give an opinion.
I was not there.

472
00:34:48,471 --> 00:34:52,481
My opinion is, uh...
limited to the causes of death.

473
00:34:55,238 --> 00:34:57,528
Have you any reason to be dissatisfied?

474
00:34:58,081 --> 00:35:01,532
Was it possible that his death
might have been

475
00:35:02,574 --> 00:35:03,732
not accidental?

476
00:35:05,368 --> 00:35:07,099
Could he have been...

477
00:35:08,131 --> 00:35:09,623
Could he have been...

478
00:35:10,493 --> 00:35:11,985
Pushed, Dr Winkel?

479
00:35:14,217 --> 00:35:15,710
"Winkel."

480
00:35:16,821 --> 00:35:18,824
I cannot give an opinion.

481
00:35:19,544 --> 00:35:23,108
The injuries to the head and skull
would have been the same.

482
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:33,297
Major, may I see you
for a moment, please?

483
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:35,128
Certainly, Brodsky. What is it?

484
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:37,450
This forgery is very clever,

485
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,464
and we are interested in this case.

486
00:35:40,565 --> 00:35:42,535
- Have you arrested the girl?
- No, not yet.

487
00:35:42,647 --> 00:35:47,271
Please, keep this passport to yourself
until I make some inquiries. Will you, Major?

488
00:35:47,371 --> 00:35:48,978
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

489
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:51,676
Right, sit down, Miss Schmidt.

490
00:35:51,776 --> 00:35:54,398
We'll send your letters
and things back to you.

491
00:35:54,498 --> 00:35:57,232
- And my passport?
- We'll need that for a while longer.

492
00:36:02,306 --> 00:36:03,753
What did he mean?

493
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:07,033
You know as much as I do.

494
00:36:07,952 --> 00:36:09,444
Miss Schmidt,

495
00:36:10,075 --> 00:36:12,978
you were intimate
with Lime, weren't you?

496
00:36:13,078 --> 00:36:15,299
We loved each other. Do you mean that?

497
00:36:15,399 --> 00:36:18,009
- Do you know this man?
- I've never seen him.

498
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:20,464
- Joseph Harbin.
- No.

499
00:36:20,565 --> 00:36:22,969
- He works in a military hospital.
- No.

500
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:28,581
It's stupid to lie to me, Miss Schmidt.
I'm in a position to help you.

501
00:36:28,894 --> 00:36:30,385
I'm not lying.

502
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:33,864
You're wrong about Harry.
You're wrong about everything.

503
00:36:34,219 --> 00:36:36,161
In one of his letters,
he asked you to telephone

504
00:36:36,261 --> 00:36:38,763
a good friend of his called Joseph.

505
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:41,767
He gave you the number
of the Casanova Club.

506
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,997
That's where a lot of friends
of Lime used to go.

507
00:36:45,902 --> 00:36:47,042
It wasn't important.

508
00:36:47,593 --> 00:36:49,403
What was the message?

509
00:36:49,915 --> 00:36:52,124
Something about meeting Harry
at his home.

510
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:55,759
Harbin disappeared
the day you telephoned.

511
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:57,133
We've got to find him.

512
00:36:57,563 --> 00:36:59,328
You can help us.

513
00:37:00,846 --> 00:37:04,137
What can I tell you, but
you've got everything upside down.

514
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:06,431
Okay.

515
00:37:06,532 --> 00:37:09,378
That American friend of yours
is still waiting for you.

516
00:37:10,617 --> 00:37:12,587
He won't do you much good.

517
00:37:15,861 --> 00:37:18,596
I thank you, Miss Schmidt.
We'll send for you when we want you.

518
00:37:26,687 --> 00:37:29,896
Hello, Mr Martins. I've been trying
to get you at your hotel.

519
00:37:29,996 --> 00:37:31,858
I've arranged that lecture for tomorrow.

520
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,860
- Well, what about?
- On the modern novel.

521
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,691
- You remember what we arranged.
- Oh.

522
00:37:35,802 --> 00:37:37,693
Now, they want you to talk
on the crisis of faith.

523
00:37:37,804 --> 00:37:40,907
- What's that?
- Oh, I thought you'd know. You're a writer.

524
00:37:41,403 --> 00:37:42,409
But of course you do.

525
00:37:42,509 --> 00:37:44,190
Good night, young man.
Oh, I've forgotten my hat.

526
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:46,614
- I'll let you know the time later.
- Mmm.

527
00:37:55,181 --> 00:37:56,883
- Drink?
- Whisky.

528
00:37:57,266 --> 00:37:58,395
Two whiskies.

529
00:38:05,687 --> 00:38:06,978
How much?

530
00:38:07,078 --> 00:38:08,855
Oh, they don't take army money here.

531
00:38:08,955 --> 00:38:10,686
How much did he say?

532
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,168
- Harry?
- Yes.

533
00:38:16,523 --> 00:38:19,051
He moved his head,
but the rest is good, isn't it?

534
00:38:35,182 --> 00:38:37,756
- Good evening, Miss Schmidt.
- Good evening.

535
00:38:37,865 --> 00:38:40,167
You've found out my little secret.

536
00:38:40,267 --> 00:38:41,873
A man must live.

537
00:38:42,509 --> 00:38:44,131
How goes the investigation?

538
00:38:44,231 --> 00:38:46,814
- Have you proved the policemen are wrong?
- Not yet.

539
00:38:46,914 --> 00:38:50,204
But you will. Our friend Dr Winkel
said you had called.

540
00:38:51,278 --> 00:38:54,364
- Wasn't he helpful?
- Well, he was, uh... limited.

541
00:38:54,842 --> 00:38:57,224
- But Mr Popescu is here tonight.
- The Romanian?

542
00:38:57,324 --> 00:38:59,648
- Yes, the man who helped carry him.
- I thought he'd left Vienna.

543
00:39:00,528 --> 00:39:02,019
He's back now.

544
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,141
Well, I'd like to meet
all of Harry's friends.

545
00:39:05,332 --> 00:39:07,177
I'll bring him to you.

546
00:39:07,775 --> 00:39:09,380
Haven't you done enough for tonight?

547
00:39:10,778 --> 00:39:14,149
The porter said three men carried
the body, and two of them are here.

548
00:39:20,508 --> 00:39:21,647
Who are you looking for now?

549
00:39:21,747 --> 00:39:24,273
Ssh, ssh. Don't. Don't. Please don't.

550
00:39:26,194 --> 00:39:27,641
Silly-looking bunch.

551
00:39:29,958 --> 00:39:32,299
- Mr Popescu, Mr Martins.
- How do you do?

552
00:39:32,399 --> 00:39:34,342
- How do you do?
- Any friend of Harry is a friend of mine.

553
00:39:34,442 --> 00:39:36,665
- I'll leave you together.
- Good evening, Miss Schmidt.

554
00:39:36,765 --> 00:39:38,610
- You remember me?
- Of course.

555
00:39:39,528 --> 00:39:42,470
- I helped Harry fix her papers, Mr Martins.
- Oh, you did?

556
00:39:42,571 --> 00:39:44,513
Not the sort of thing
I should confess to a stranger,

557
00:39:44,613 --> 00:39:47,556
but you have to break
the rules sometimes.

558
00:39:47,656 --> 00:39:50,719
Humanity is a duty.
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?

559
00:39:51,265 --> 00:39:52,561
Keep the pack.

560
00:39:52,661 --> 00:39:54,162
I understand you were with Harry...

561
00:39:54,262 --> 00:39:55,644
Two double whiskies.

562
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:02,531
It was a terrible thing.

563
00:40:02,631 --> 00:40:04,761
I was just crossing the road
to go to Harry.

564
00:40:05,473 --> 00:40:08,161
He and the Baron were on the sidewalk.

565
00:40:08,356 --> 00:40:12,100
Maybe if I hadn't started to cross the road,
it wouldn't have happened.

566
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,652
I can't help blaming myself
and wishing things had been different.

567
00:40:16,484 --> 00:40:20,779
Anyway, he saw me and stepped
off the sidewalk to meet me.

568
00:40:21,531 --> 00:40:22,693
And the truck...

569
00:40:24,052 --> 00:40:28,346
It was terrible, Mr Martins. Terrible.
I've never seen a man killed before.

570
00:40:28,457 --> 00:40:30,920
I think there was something funny
about the whole thing.

571
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,242
- Funny?
- Something wrong.

572
00:40:33,342 --> 00:40:34,869
Of course there was.

573
00:40:34,984 --> 00:40:36,484
Some ice for Mr Martins.

574
00:40:36,585 --> 00:40:38,007
You think so, too, hmm?

575
00:40:38,107 --> 00:40:40,328
It was so terribly stupid
for a man like Harry

576
00:40:40,428 --> 00:40:42,833
to be killed in an ordinary
street accident.

577
00:40:42,952 --> 00:40:45,434
- That's all you meant?
- What else?

578
00:40:46,035 --> 00:40:47,242
Who was the third man?

579
00:40:49,378 --> 00:40:51,100
I oughtn't to drink it.

580
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,806
It makes me acid.

581
00:40:53,282 --> 00:40:55,173
What man would you be
referring to, Mr Martins?

582
00:40:55,565 --> 00:40:58,138
I was told that a third man
helped you and Kurtz carry the body.

583
00:40:58,487 --> 00:41:00,550
Oh, I don't know how you got that idea.

584
00:41:00,651 --> 00:41:02,593
You'll find all about it
in the police report.

585
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:05,675
There was just the two of us.
Me and the Baron.

586
00:41:05,775 --> 00:41:08,037
Who could have told you
a story like that?

587
00:41:08,137 --> 00:41:10,541
The porter at Harry's place.
He was cleaning the window at the time.

588
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,203
And saw the accident?

589
00:41:13,303 --> 00:41:15,284
No, no, he didn't see the accident,

590
00:41:15,384 --> 00:41:17,196
but he saw three men carrying the body.

591
00:41:17,827 --> 00:41:20,130
Why wasn't he at the police inquiry?

592
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,651
He didn't want to get involved.

593
00:41:21,752 --> 00:41:24,453
You'll never teach these Austrians
to be good citizens.

594
00:41:24,554 --> 00:41:26,798
It was his duty to give the evidence.

595
00:41:27,798 --> 00:41:29,689
Even so, he remembers wrong.

596
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:32,221
What else did he tell you?

597
00:41:32,322 --> 00:41:35,706
That Harry was dead
before you got him to that statue.

598
00:41:35,806 --> 00:41:38,188
He probably knows a lot more than that.

599
00:41:38,288 --> 00:41:41,101
- Somebody's lying.
- Hmm, not necessarily.

600
00:41:41,451 --> 00:41:44,274
The police say he was
mixed up in some, uh... racket?

601
00:41:44,374 --> 00:41:46,356
Oh, that's quite impossible.

602
00:41:46,456 --> 00:41:48,187
He had a great sense of duty.

603
00:41:48,779 --> 00:41:50,783
Your friend Kurtz
seems to think it was possible.

604
00:41:51,061 --> 00:41:53,363
I understand how an Anglo-Saxon feels.

605
00:41:53,463 --> 00:41:55,149
The Baron hasn't travelled, you know?

606
00:41:55,586 --> 00:41:57,476
He seems to have been around a bit.

607
00:41:58,589 --> 00:42:01,072
Do you know a man called, uh... Harbin?

608
00:42:01,512 --> 00:42:03,734
- No.
- Joseph Harbin.

609
00:42:03,834 --> 00:42:06,157
Joseph Harbin? No. No.

610
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:13,372
That's a nice girl, that,
but she ought to go careful in Vienna.

611
00:42:13,924 --> 00:42:17,615
Everybody ought to go careful
in a city like this.

612
00:42:20,931 --> 00:42:23,778
He will meet us at the bridge. Good.

613
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:05,021
Hello! Is it so very important for you?

614
00:43:05,136 --> 00:43:07,639
- Yes, it is.
- I am not a bad man.

615
00:43:07,949 --> 00:43:10,028
I'd like to tell you something.

616
00:43:10,246 --> 00:43:11,523
Tell me, how did the car...

617
00:43:11,623 --> 00:43:16,207
Ssh, ssh.
Come tonight. My wife goes out.

618
00:43:16,307 --> 00:43:19,473
- All right, I'll come back, but...
- Shh! Tonight.

619
00:43:36,431 --> 00:43:37,649
Does that mean come in?

620
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:39,526
Oh, yes, yes. Come in.

621
00:43:39,626 --> 00:43:41,393
The porter's going to talk
to us tonight.

622
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,235
Need we go through it all again?

623
00:43:43,335 --> 00:43:45,739
I can manage by myself. You busy?

624
00:43:46,629 --> 00:43:48,770
Just another part I've got to learn.

625
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:50,344
Can I hear you?

626
00:43:51,067 --> 00:43:53,073
- In German?
- I can try.

627
00:43:53,185 --> 00:43:54,927
Is it comedy or tragedy?

628
00:43:55,027 --> 00:43:56,838
Comedy. I don't play tragedy.

629
00:43:56,989 --> 00:43:59,312
- Do I, uh... read...
- Well, you read this.

630
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:02,564
Oh. Well, uh...

631
00:44:06,438 --> 00:44:09,623
- What's that?
- Uh, Heurigen, I guess.

632
00:44:09,723 --> 00:44:11,505
H-E-Z-T...

633
00:44:11,605 --> 00:44:13,706
Oh, let me see.
No, no, that's not the cue.

634
00:44:13,806 --> 00:44:15,573
It means she has to sit down.

635
00:44:19,852 --> 00:44:23,861
Well, uh... Frau Hausman...

636
00:44:25,377 --> 00:44:26,824
No, no.

637
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:29,366
It's no good.

638
00:44:32,238 --> 00:44:33,240
Bad day?

639
00:44:33,828 --> 00:44:35,552
It's always bad about this time.

640
00:44:37,323 --> 00:44:39,248
He used to look in around 6:00.

641
00:44:41,472 --> 00:44:45,084
I've been frightened.
I've been alone without friends and money.

642
00:44:46,386 --> 00:44:48,311
But I've never known anything like this.

643
00:44:50,965 --> 00:44:54,408
- Please talk. Tell me about him.
- Tell you what?

644
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:57,098
Oh, anything. Just talk.

645
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:00,582
Where did you see him last?
When? What did you do?

646
00:45:00,774 --> 00:45:03,837
Oh, we didn't make much sense.
We drank too much.

647
00:45:03,937 --> 00:45:06,989
- Once he tried to steal my girl.
- Where is she?

648
00:45:08,942 --> 00:45:10,844
Oh, that was nine years ago.

649
00:45:10,944 --> 00:45:12,686
Tell me more.

650
00:45:12,786 --> 00:45:15,810
Well, it's very difficult.
You knew Harry.

651
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:18,451
We didn't do anything very amusing.

652
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:22,255
He just made everything
seem like such, uh... fun.

653
00:45:22,355 --> 00:45:23,961
Was he clever when he was a boy?

654
00:45:24,357 --> 00:45:26,248
I suppose so. He could fix anything.

655
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,123
- What sort of things?
- Oh, little things.

656
00:45:29,363 --> 00:45:33,292
How to put your temperature up
before exam. The best crib.

657
00:45:33,528 --> 00:45:35,740
Uh, how to avoid this and that.

658
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,606
He fixed my papers for me.

659
00:45:38,738 --> 00:45:41,075
He heard the Russians
were repatriating people like me

660
00:45:41,175 --> 00:45:43,338
who came from Czechoslovakia.

661
00:45:43,975 --> 00:45:46,681
He knew the right person
straightaway for forging stamps.

662
00:45:46,925 --> 00:45:48,281
Yeah.

663
00:45:48,382 --> 00:45:51,245
When he was 14,
he taught me the three-card trick.

664
00:45:51,345 --> 00:45:52,758
That's growing up fast.

665
00:45:53,347 --> 00:45:54,760
He never grew up.

666
00:45:55,830 --> 00:45:58,358
The world grew up
around him, that's all.

667
00:46:00,474 --> 00:46:02,046
And buried him.

668
00:46:03,355 --> 00:46:04,767
Anna.

669
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:06,361
You'll fall in love again.

670
00:46:07,081 --> 00:46:08,892
Don't you see I don't want to?

671
00:46:10,047 --> 00:46:11,290
I don't ever want to.

672
00:46:12,487 --> 00:46:13,899
Come on out and have a drink.

673
00:46:14,929 --> 00:46:16,430
Why did you say that?

674
00:46:16,531 --> 00:46:17,943
Seemed like a good idea.

675
00:46:19,373 --> 00:46:21,716
It was just what he used to say.

676
00:46:21,816 --> 00:46:24,789
Well, uh... I didn't learn that
from him.

677
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,563
If we have to see the porter,
we'd better go.

678
00:46:28,664 --> 00:46:31,092
What's the hurry? Can't we talk quietly
for a couple of minutes?

679
00:46:31,192 --> 00:46:32,213
I thought you wanted...

680
00:46:32,313 --> 00:46:34,610
A moment ago, you said
you didn't want to see the porter.

681
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:36,918
We're both in it, Harry.

682
00:46:37,071 --> 00:46:39,801
- Holly.
- I'm so sorry.

683
00:46:41,236 --> 00:46:42,727
It's all right.

684
00:46:43,478 --> 00:46:44,890
You might get my name right.

685
00:46:47,923 --> 00:46:50,816
You know, you ought to
find yourself a girl.

686
00:46:52,087 --> 00:46:54,428
His English is so very bad,
we'll let him talk German.

687
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:56,071
If you'll just be good enough to...

688
00:46:56,171 --> 00:46:57,618
Look.

689
00:46:59,707 --> 00:47:02,188
- That's Harry's place, isn't it?
- Yes.

690
00:47:02,417 --> 00:47:05,080
- Let's go away.
- What's the matter?

691
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:07,264
Let's not get into any more trouble.

692
00:47:08,736 --> 00:47:09,899
Wait here.

693
00:47:14,066 --> 00:47:15,170
What's the matter?

694
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:17,012
Uh, what is, uh...

695
00:47:18,954 --> 00:47:20,335
I... I don't understand.

696
00:47:20,436 --> 00:47:23,264
Um, porter, uh... dead.

697
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:24,660
Kaputt.

698
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,542
The porter is...

699
00:47:28,884 --> 00:47:30,586
- Porter?
- He's murdered.

700
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,755
I, uh... don't understand.

701
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:11,868
- What is it?
- The porter's been murdered.

702
00:48:17,453 --> 00:48:19,937
They think you did it.

703
00:48:40,476 --> 00:48:42,241
Papa!

704
00:49:11,468 --> 00:49:12,770
Their money's no good.

705
00:49:28,405 --> 00:49:30,108
Sneak out the other way
and go back to your theatre.

706
00:49:30,208 --> 00:49:31,551
I'd better not see you again.

707
00:49:31,651 --> 00:49:33,992
- What are you going to do?
- I wish I knew.

708
00:49:34,092 --> 00:49:36,494
Be sensible. Tell Major Calloway.

709
00:49:57,836 --> 00:50:00,699
- Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
- Oh, Mr Martins.

710
00:50:00,799 --> 00:50:02,661
It's very urgent.
Just get him on the telephone.

711
00:50:02,761 --> 00:50:04,026
Uh, do you know his number?

712
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:06,264
- No, I don't know his number.
- I'll look it up for you.

713
00:50:06,364 --> 00:50:08,130
Is there a car here I can use?

714
00:50:08,366 --> 00:50:11,135
Of course. There's one waiting for you.

715
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:14,463
Never mind about the number.

716
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:23,747
Take me to the headquarters...

717
00:50:28,106 --> 00:50:31,432
Hold on! Hold on! I haven't even
told you where to take me yet!

718
00:50:34,554 --> 00:50:36,398
Driver! Driver!

719
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:40,860
Slow down!

720
00:50:43,923 --> 00:50:45,734
Have you got orders to kill me?

721
00:51:19,279 --> 00:51:22,182
Ah, Mr Martins!
What a relief to see you.

722
00:51:22,282 --> 00:51:24,303
I was beginning to think
something had happened to you.

723
00:51:24,403 --> 00:51:26,453
Come along, Mr Martins.
Everything's ready for you.

724
00:51:26,927 --> 00:51:30,269
I was frantic in case you hadn't
got my message at the hotel.

725
00:51:30,369 --> 00:51:33,170
The porters out here are so unreliable,
if you know what I mean.

726
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:35,653
We're all set for a wonderful meeting.

727
00:51:35,753 --> 00:51:37,917
You'll find the audience
most appreciative.

728
00:51:38,017 --> 00:51:40,159
Oh, let me take your coat. I've got it.

729
00:51:40,259 --> 00:51:43,723
There'll be refreshments afterwards.
Come along, Mr M. Follow me.

730
00:51:43,823 --> 00:51:46,446
Well, here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
All's well that ends well.

731
00:51:46,547 --> 00:51:48,288
Would you look after those for me?
Thank you.

732
00:51:48,388 --> 00:51:50,730
Would you like to sit there, Mr Martins?
That's right.

733
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:53,093
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have much pleasure in introducing

734
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:55,776
Mr Holly Martins from the other side.

735
00:52:00,521 --> 00:52:03,003
Well...

736
00:52:04,044 --> 00:52:07,415
Bring the car and anyone
else who'd like to come.

737
00:52:07,648 --> 00:52:09,937
Don't be long. Hmm.

738
00:52:13,734 --> 00:52:17,878
Yeah, well, I...
I suppose that is what I meant to say.

739
00:52:17,978 --> 00:52:19,308
Of course, of course, of course.

740
00:52:19,408 --> 00:52:22,312
Do you believe, Mr Martins,
in the stream of consciousness?

741
00:52:24,985 --> 00:52:28,355
Stream of consciousness? Well, uh...

742
00:52:28,455 --> 00:52:29,591
Well, uh...

743
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:32,239
What author
has chiefly influenced you?

744
00:52:32,793 --> 00:52:35,197
- Grey.
- Grey? What Grey?

745
00:52:35,876 --> 00:52:38,670
- Zane Grey.
- That's Mr Martins' little joke, of course.

746
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:42,564
We all know perfectly well
Zane Grey wrote what we call "westerns."

747
00:52:42,684 --> 00:52:43,998
Cowboys and bandits.

748
00:52:44,098 --> 00:52:48,213
Mr James Joyce.
Now, where would you put him?

749
00:52:50,371 --> 00:52:52,714
Oh, uh... would you mind
repeating that question?

750
00:52:52,814 --> 00:52:55,876
I said, where would you put
Mr James Joyce?

751
00:52:55,976 --> 00:52:57,389
In what category?

752
00:52:57,489 --> 00:53:01,343
Can I ask, is Mr Martins
engaged on a new book?

753
00:53:02,743 --> 00:53:06,287
Yes. It's called The Third Man.

754
00:53:06,387 --> 00:53:09,075
- A novel, Mr Martins?
- It's a murder story.

755
00:53:10,071 --> 00:53:13,014
I've just started it.
It's based on fact.

756
00:53:13,114 --> 00:53:14,606
Why, it's Mr Popescu!

757
00:53:14,716 --> 00:53:17,338
Oh, very great pleasure
to see you here, Mr Popescu.

758
00:53:17,438 --> 00:53:20,141
As you know, ladies and gentlemen,
Mr Popescu is a very great supporter

759
00:53:20,241 --> 00:53:21,768
of one of our medical charities.

760
00:53:22,323 --> 00:53:24,853
Are you a slow writer, Mr Martins?

761
00:53:25,406 --> 00:53:26,708
Not when I get interested.

762
00:53:26,809 --> 00:53:30,578
I'd say you were doing something
pretty dangerous this time.

763
00:53:31,132 --> 00:53:33,866
- Yeah?
- Mixing fact and fiction.

764
00:53:34,215 --> 00:53:37,520
- Should I make it all fact?
- Why, no, Mr Martins.

765
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:40,041
I'd say stick to fiction.
Straight fiction.

766
00:53:40,141 --> 00:53:43,004
I'm too far along
with the book, Mr Popescu.

767
00:53:43,105 --> 00:53:45,459
Haven't you ever
scrapped a book, Mr Martins?

768
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:46,607
Never.

769
00:53:46,707 --> 00:53:47,949
Pity.

770
00:53:49,967 --> 00:53:52,133
Ladies and gentlemen, if there are
no more questions for Mr Martins,

771
00:53:52,233 --> 00:53:55,048
I think I can call the meeting
officially closed.

772
00:54:33,876 --> 00:54:36,612
Who's there? Who is it?

773
00:54:37,556 --> 00:54:38,568
Who is it?

774
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,686
It's all right. It's all right.

775
00:55:47,191 --> 00:55:49,492
I told you to go away, Martins.

776
00:55:49,593 --> 00:55:53,136
This isn't Santa Fe, I'm not a sheriff
and you aren't a cowboy.

777
00:55:53,236 --> 00:55:55,980
You've been blundering around with
the worst bunch of racketeers in Vienna,

778
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:58,623
your precious Harry's friends,
and now you're wanted for murder.

779
00:55:58,723 --> 00:56:01,104
- Put down drunk and disorderly, too.
- I have.

780
00:56:01,205 --> 00:56:04,027
- What's the matter with your hand?
- Parrot bit me.

781
00:56:04,128 --> 00:56:06,551
Oh, stop behaving like a fool, Martins.

782
00:56:06,651 --> 00:56:10,194
I'm only a little fool. I'm an amateur at it.
You're a professional.

783
00:56:10,294 --> 00:56:12,436
You've been shaking
your cap and bells all over town.

784
00:56:12,537 --> 00:56:16,431
Paine, get me the Harry Lime file,
and get Mr Martins a large whisky.

785
00:56:16,661 --> 00:56:18,904
I don't need your drinks, Calloway.

786
00:56:19,143 --> 00:56:21,926
You will. I don't want
another murder in this case

787
00:56:22,026 --> 00:56:24,529
and you were born to be murdered,
so you're going to hear the facts.

788
00:56:24,629 --> 00:56:26,554
You haven't told me a single one yet.

789
00:56:28,615 --> 00:56:31,237
- Have you ever heard of penicillin?
- Well?

790
00:56:31,337 --> 00:56:34,058
In Vienna, there hasn't been
enough penicillin to go around.

791
00:56:34,158 --> 00:56:36,049
So a nice trade started here.

792
00:56:37,201 --> 00:56:40,144
Stealing penicillin
from the military hospitals,

793
00:56:40,244 --> 00:56:44,108
diluting it to make it go further
and selling it to patients.

794
00:56:44,208 --> 00:56:46,190
- Do you see what that means?
- Are you too busy

795
00:56:46,291 --> 00:56:49,394
chasing a few tubes of penicillin
to investigate a murder?

796
00:56:49,494 --> 00:56:50,940
These were murders.

797
00:56:51,537 --> 00:56:53,718
Men with gangrened legs,

798
00:56:53,818 --> 00:56:56,552
women in childbirth,
and there were children, too.

799
00:56:57,222 --> 00:57:00,525
They used some of this
diluted penicillin against meningitis.

800
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:02,366
The lucky children died.

801
00:57:02,466 --> 00:57:05,873
The unlucky ones went off their heads.
You can see them now in the mental ward.

802
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:08,694
That was the racket
Harry Lime organised.

803
00:57:08,794 --> 00:57:12,096
Calloway, you haven't shown me
one shred of evidence.

804
00:57:12,197 --> 00:57:13,939
We're just coming to that.

805
00:57:14,039 --> 00:57:17,013
Paine, magic lantern show.

806
00:57:17,818 --> 00:57:18,822
Very good, sir.

807
00:57:18,922 --> 00:57:21,025
You know,
Paine's one of your devoted readers.

808
00:57:21,125 --> 00:57:24,405
He's promised to lend me one of your books.
Which one is it, Paine?

809
00:57:24,505 --> 00:57:26,031
The Lone Rider of Santa Fe, sir.

810
00:57:26,131 --> 00:57:27,993
That's right. The Lone Rider
of Santa Fe.

811
00:57:28,093 --> 00:57:30,315
I'd like to visit Texas one day, sir.

812
00:57:30,416 --> 00:57:32,522
Come on. Show me
what you've got to show.

813
00:57:32,622 --> 00:57:34,508
- All right, Paine?
- Yes, sir.

814
00:57:37,422 --> 00:57:39,565
Paine, Paine, Paine.

815
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:41,366
I got them muddled.

816
00:57:41,466 --> 00:57:43,790
It's the new lot
that's just come in for Mr Crabbin.

817
00:57:45,872 --> 00:57:50,838
See this man here? A fellow called Harbin,
a medical orderly at the general hospital.

818
00:57:51,777 --> 00:57:55,628
He worked for Lime and helped
to steal the stuff from the laboratories.

819
00:57:55,728 --> 00:57:57,823
We forced him to give information to us

820
00:57:57,923 --> 00:58:00,386
which led us as far as Kurtz and Lime.

821
00:58:00,486 --> 00:58:02,828
But we didn't arrest them,
as our evidence wasn't complete

822
00:58:02,928 --> 00:58:05,231
and it might have spoiled
our chances of getting the others.

823
00:58:05,331 --> 00:58:08,594
- Next, Paine.
- I'd like a word with this orderly Harbin.

824
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:10,997
- So would I.
- Well, bring him in.

825
00:58:11,097 --> 00:58:13,199
I can't. He disappeared a week ago.

826
00:58:13,299 --> 00:58:15,642
This is more like a mortuary
than police headquarters.

827
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:18,395
We have better witnesses. Look here.

828
00:58:47,374 --> 00:58:48,456
How could he have done it?

829
00:58:49,096 --> 00:58:51,278
£70 a tube.

830
00:58:51,378 --> 00:58:54,641
Go back to the hotel,
and do keep out of trouble.

831
00:58:54,741 --> 00:58:57,805
I'll try and fix things with the Austrian
police. You'll be all right in the hotel

832
00:58:57,905 --> 00:58:59,989
but I can't be responsible
for you on the streets.

833
00:59:00,107 --> 00:59:02,168
I'm not asking you to.

834
00:59:02,268 --> 00:59:03,636
I'm sorry, Martins.

835
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:05,513
I'm sorry, too.

836
00:59:09,075 --> 00:59:11,098
You still got
that aeroplane ticket on you?

837
00:59:11,198 --> 00:59:13,260
We'll send one across
to your hotel in the morning.

838
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:16,343
Thank you. Excuse me.

839
00:59:16,443 --> 00:59:18,546
Get me Austrian police headquarters.

840
00:59:18,646 --> 00:59:20,908
Can I have that woman's passport?

841
00:59:21,008 --> 00:59:22,374
You know, the Anna Schmidt one.

842
00:59:23,572 --> 00:59:25,017
Oh...

843
00:59:25,453 --> 00:59:27,114
We're not going to pick her up for that,
are we?

844
00:59:27,214 --> 00:59:30,460
What can we do?
We have our instructions.

845
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:17,913
Me.

846
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:24,660
It's me.

847
01:00:30,378 --> 01:00:31,380
Hello.

848
01:00:32,824 --> 01:00:34,047
What is it?
What's happened to you?

849
01:00:34,724 --> 01:00:35,885
Just came to see you.

850
01:00:38,014 --> 01:00:40,217
Come in. I thought you
were going to keep away.

851
01:00:40,317 --> 01:00:42,243
Are the police after you?

852
01:00:42,343 --> 01:00:43,789
I don't know.

853
01:00:45,418 --> 01:00:48,979
- You're drunk, aren't you?
- A bit. I'm sorry.

854
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:54,311
But I did want to say goodbye
before I pushed off.

855
01:00:55,057 --> 01:00:57,386
- I'm going back home.
- Why?

856
01:00:59,251 --> 01:01:01,475
It's what you've always wanted.

857
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:02,864
All of you.

858
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:06,078
Kitty? Here, kitty.

859
01:01:06,178 --> 01:01:08,977
Kitty? Here, kitty.
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

860
01:01:09,078 --> 01:01:12,085
Don't you want to play, kitty?
Aw, sleepy? Sleepy, kitty?

861
01:01:14,231 --> 01:01:15,892
Not very sociable, is he?

862
01:01:15,992 --> 01:01:17,677
No, he only liked Harry.

863
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:21,030
What made you decide so suddenly?

864
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:23,071
Uh, I brought you these, uh.

865
01:01:23,908 --> 01:01:24,910
They got a little wet.

866
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:27,940
- What happened to your hand?
- A parrot...

867
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:31,518
- Let it go.
- Have you seen Calloway?

868
01:01:32,913 --> 01:01:34,947
Imagine a parrot nipping a man.

869
01:01:35,047 --> 01:01:37,210
- Have you?
- It's...

870
01:01:38,311 --> 01:01:40,413
Oh, I...

871
01:01:40,513 --> 01:01:44,839
I've been saying goodbye
all over, you know.

872
01:01:44,939 --> 01:01:46,521
He told you, didn't he?

873
01:01:47,737 --> 01:01:48,820
Told me?

874
01:01:49,138 --> 01:01:50,379
About Harry.

875
01:01:51,521 --> 01:01:52,648
Do you know?

876
01:01:54,424 --> 01:01:56,234
I've seen Major Calloway today.

877
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:40,315
He's better dead.

878
01:02:41,912 --> 01:02:44,975
I knew he was mixed up,
but not like that.

879
01:02:45,075 --> 01:02:48,082
I knew him for 20 years.
At least, I thought I knew him.

880
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:52,782
Suppose he was laughing
at fools like us all the time?

881
01:02:52,883 --> 01:02:56,306
- He liked to laugh.
- £70 a tube.

882
01:02:56,406 --> 01:03:00,540
He wanted me to write
for his great medical charity.

883
01:03:00,651 --> 01:03:02,793
I'll put these flowers in the water.

884
01:03:02,894 --> 01:03:06,504
Perhaps I could have raised
the price to £80 for him.

885
01:03:06,617 --> 01:03:10,681
Oh, please. For heaven's sake,
stop making him in your image.

886
01:03:10,781 --> 01:03:14,045
Harry was real.
He wasn't just your friend and my lover.

887
01:03:14,145 --> 01:03:17,834
- He was Harry.
- Well, don't preach wisdom to me.

888
01:03:18,549 --> 01:03:20,076
You talk about him

889
01:03:21,192 --> 01:03:23,322
as if he had occasional bad manners.

890
01:03:24,115 --> 01:03:26,349
No. I don't know. I'm just a

891
01:03:26,449 --> 01:03:29,460
hack writer who
drinks too much and

892
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:31,292
falls in love with girls.

893
01:03:33,885 --> 01:03:35,328
You.

894
01:03:36,172 --> 01:03:38,933
- Me?
- Don't be such a fool. Of course.

895
01:03:40,571 --> 01:03:44,012
If you'd rung me up and asked me
were you fair or dark

896
01:03:44,112 --> 01:03:45,868
or had a moustache,
I wouldn't have known.

897
01:03:47,498 --> 01:03:49,000
Oh, I am leaving Vienna.

898
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:54,317
I don't care whether Harry was murdered
by Kurtz or Popescu or the third man.

899
01:03:55,987 --> 01:03:59,131
Whoever killed him,
there was some sort of...

900
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:01,053
Justice.

901
01:04:01,153 --> 01:04:03,415
Maybe I would've killed him myself.

902
01:04:03,515 --> 01:04:05,919
A person doesn't change
because you find out more.

903
01:04:06,398 --> 01:04:08,060
Look. I've got a splitting headache,

904
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,964
and you stand there
and just talk and talk and talk.

905
01:04:11,064 --> 01:04:12,895
I... I hate it.

906
01:04:14,405 --> 01:04:17,842
That's the first time
I ever saw you laugh.

907
01:04:17,942 --> 01:04:19,702
Do it again.

908
01:04:24,536 --> 01:04:26,506
There isn't enough for two laughs.

909
01:04:36,629 --> 01:04:38,712
I'd make comic faces and

910
01:04:40,712 --> 01:04:44,164
stand on my head and grin at you
between my legs

911
01:04:45,998 --> 01:04:48,003
and tell all sorts of jokes...

912
01:04:51,363 --> 01:04:53,813
I wouldn't stand a chance, would I?

913
01:04:59,451 --> 01:05:00,739
Hmm.

914
01:05:04,897 --> 01:05:06,469
Well...

915
01:05:08,581 --> 01:05:12,271
You did tell me
I ought to find myself a girl.

916
01:05:42,456 --> 01:05:45,702
What kind of a spy do you think you are,
satchel foot?

917
01:05:48,222 --> 01:05:49,793
What are you tailing me for?

918
01:05:52,946 --> 01:05:54,109
Cat got your tongue?

919
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:58,356
Come on out.

920
01:05:59,312 --> 01:06:01,967
Come out, come out, whoever you are.

921
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:06,810
Step out in the light,
and let's have a look at ya.

922
01:06:07,682 --> 01:06:08,863
Who's your boss?

923
01:06:24,979 --> 01:06:26,061
Harry.

924
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:54,273
Harry!

925
01:07:42,257 --> 01:07:45,548
I followed his shadow until suddenly...

926
01:07:46,182 --> 01:07:47,883
Well?

927
01:07:47,983 --> 01:07:49,245
This is where he vanished.

928
01:07:49,345 --> 01:07:52,447
- I see.
- I suppose you don't believe me.

929
01:07:52,547 --> 01:07:54,891
- No.
- Look. I tell you...

930
01:07:54,991 --> 01:07:57,056
- You don't think I'm blind, do you?
- Yes.

931
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:58,555
Where were you when you saw him first?

932
01:07:58,655 --> 01:08:00,006
Fifty yards right down there.

933
01:08:00,106 --> 01:08:01,116
Which side of the road?

934
01:08:01,216 --> 01:08:03,198
I was on that side.
His shadow was on that side.

935
01:08:03,298 --> 01:08:04,681
And there are no turnings
on either side.

936
01:08:04,781 --> 01:08:05,881
What about the doorways?

937
01:08:05,981 --> 01:08:08,284
- I tell you, I heard him running ahead of me!
- Yes, yes, yes.

938
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:12,029
And then he vanished out there, I suppose,
with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...

939
01:08:29,966 --> 01:08:32,050
It wasn't the German gin.

940
01:09:00,597 --> 01:09:03,700
Well, what's this? Where are we?

941
01:09:03,801 --> 01:09:05,291
It's the main sewer.

942
01:09:06,688 --> 01:09:08,768
Runs right into the blue Danube.

943
01:09:09,245 --> 01:09:10,613
Smells sweet, doesn't it?

944
01:09:14,009 --> 01:09:16,585
We should have dug deeper than a grave.

945
01:10:04,262 --> 01:10:06,187
You knew him, Major?

946
01:10:06,944 --> 01:10:09,154
Hmm. Yes.

947
01:10:10,428 --> 01:10:12,159
Yes. Joseph Harbin.

948
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:15,075
Medical orderly at the general hospital.

949
01:10:17,315 --> 01:10:20,287
- He used to work for Harry Lime.
- Joseph Harbin?

950
01:10:20,478 --> 01:10:22,005
Yes.

951
01:10:22,359 --> 01:10:24,525
He's the man I told you was missing.

952
01:10:26,404 --> 01:10:28,887
Next time we'll have
a fool proof coffin.

953
01:12:38,557 --> 01:12:39,680
Where are you taking me?

954
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:42,683
International police headquarters,
just to check up.

955
01:12:50,711 --> 01:12:54,095
I'm sorry, miss. It's orders.
We can't go against the protocol.

956
01:12:54,195 --> 01:12:55,800
I don't even know what protocol means.

957
01:12:55,917 --> 01:12:57,123
Neither do I, miss.

958
01:12:57,950 --> 01:13:00,003
Mademoiselle, your lipstick.

959
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,689
Thank you.

960
01:13:14,856 --> 01:13:16,091
Anna, what's happened to you?

961
01:13:16,191 --> 01:13:19,272
- All right, all right. Keep out of this.
- Listen, I've got to talk to you.

962
01:13:19,372 --> 01:13:21,835
- I've just seen a dead man walking.
- All right, chum. Get back.

963
01:13:21,935 --> 01:13:23,702
- I saw him buried.
- Have you?

964
01:13:23,802 --> 01:13:25,554
And now I've seen him alive.

965
01:13:33,835 --> 01:13:35,965
Just a minute. Bring her in here.

966
01:13:40,722 --> 01:13:42,248
You stay out here.

967
01:13:43,144 --> 01:13:44,431
Come in, Miss Schmidt.

968
01:13:46,147 --> 01:13:49,290
Now then, Miss Schmidt,
I'm not interested in your forged papers.

969
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:50,772
That's purely a Russian case.

970
01:13:50,872 --> 01:13:52,976
When did you last see Lime?

971
01:13:53,356 --> 01:13:54,337
Two weeks ago.

972
01:13:54,437 --> 01:13:56,647
I want the truth, Miss Schmidt.
We know he's alive.

973
01:13:57,959 --> 01:13:59,301
It is true, then.

974
01:13:59,401 --> 01:14:01,974
Joseph Harbin's body
was found in the coffin.

975
01:14:03,524 --> 01:14:05,227
What did you say? I'm sorry.

976
01:14:05,327 --> 01:14:07,775
I said another man
was buried in his place.

977
01:14:09,370 --> 01:14:10,913
Where's Harry?

978
01:14:11,013 --> 01:14:13,177
That's what we want to find out.

979
01:14:15,216 --> 01:14:18,907
I'm sorry. I don't seem able
to understand anything you say. I...

980
01:14:20,301 --> 01:14:21,829
He is alive.

981
01:14:22,223 --> 01:14:24,165
Now this minute, he is doing something.

982
01:14:24,266 --> 01:14:28,250
Miss Schmidt, we know he's somewhere
across the canal in the Russian sector.

983
01:14:28,350 --> 01:14:30,036
You may as well help us.

984
01:14:30,152 --> 01:14:33,215
In a few minutes, Colonel Brodsky will
be questioning you about your papers.

985
01:14:33,315 --> 01:14:35,969
- Tell me where Lime is.
- I don't know.

986
01:14:36,879 --> 01:14:39,248
If you help me,
I am prepared to help you.

987
01:14:40,442 --> 01:14:42,572
Martins always said you were a fool.

988
01:14:43,806 --> 01:14:47,860
Vienna is a closed city, Miss Schmidt.
He can't get away. Right.

989
01:14:48,010 --> 01:14:49,376
Poor Harry.

990
01:14:50,733 --> 01:14:52,384
I wish he was dead.

991
01:14:54,216 --> 01:14:56,620
He would be safe from all of you then.

992
01:15:06,630 --> 01:15:09,795
Why, that's you! Come up.

993
01:15:10,152 --> 01:15:12,473
Winkel, look who is here.

994
01:15:12,573 --> 01:15:14,417
I want to speak to you, Kurtz.

995
01:15:14,517 --> 01:15:17,251
- Of course. Come up.
- I'll wait here.

996
01:15:17,559 --> 01:15:20,773
- I don't understand.
- I want to talk to Harry.

997
01:15:21,765 --> 01:15:24,027
- Are you mad?
- All right. I'm mad.

998
01:15:24,127 --> 01:15:27,773
I've seen a ghost.
You tell Harry I want to see him.

999
01:15:29,172 --> 01:15:31,474
Be reasonable. Come up and talk.

1000
01:15:31,574 --> 01:15:34,387
No, thank you. I like the open.

1001
01:15:35,578 --> 01:15:37,868
Tell him I'll wait by that wheel there.

1002
01:15:39,382 --> 01:15:41,866
Or do ghosts only rise
by night, Dr Winkel?

1003
01:15:43,586 --> 01:15:45,637
You got an opinion on that?

1004
01:16:48,352 --> 01:16:50,855
Hello, old man. How are you?

1005
01:16:50,955 --> 01:16:52,416
Hello, Harry.

1006
01:16:52,517 --> 01:16:55,259
Well, well, they seem to be giving you
quite some busy time.

1007
01:16:55,359 --> 01:16:56,501
- Well, listen.
- Hmm, yes?

1008
01:16:56,602 --> 01:16:58,504
- I want to talk to you.
- Talk to me?

1009
01:16:58,604 --> 01:17:01,192
Well, of course. Come on.

1010
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:06,307
Kids used to ride this thing
a lot in the old days.

1011
01:17:06,407 --> 01:17:07,872
But they haven't the money now,
poor devils.

1012
01:17:10,815 --> 01:17:12,546
Listen, Harry. I didn't believe that...

1013
01:17:13,899 --> 01:17:15,061
It's good to see you, Holly.

1014
01:17:15,238 --> 01:17:16,440
I was at your funeral.

1015
01:17:16,541 --> 01:17:18,764
That was pretty smart, wasn't it?

1016
01:17:18,864 --> 01:17:21,006
Oh, the same old indigestion, Holly.

1017
01:17:21,106 --> 01:17:23,247
These are the only things
that help, these tablets.

1018
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:26,250
These are the last. Can't get 'em
anywhere in Europe any more.

1019
01:17:26,351 --> 01:17:28,293
- Do you know what's happened to your girl?
- Hmm?

1020
01:17:28,393 --> 01:17:31,577
- She's been arrested.
- Tough. Very tough. But don't worry, old man.

1021
01:17:31,677 --> 01:17:34,280
- They won't hurt her.
- They're handing her over to the Russians.

1022
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:36,373
What can I do, old man?
I'm dead, aren't I?

1023
01:17:36,473 --> 01:17:38,287
- You can help somehow.
- Holly...

1024
01:17:38,924 --> 01:17:41,547
Exactly who did you tell about me, hmm?

1025
01:17:41,647 --> 01:17:44,269
- I told the police.
- Unwise, Holly.

1026
01:17:44,369 --> 01:17:46,632
- And Anna.
- Unwise.

1027
01:17:46,732 --> 01:17:49,635
Did the, uh... police believe you?

1028
01:17:49,735 --> 01:17:51,517
You don't care anything at all
about Anna, do you?

1029
01:17:51,899 --> 01:17:53,367
I've got quite a lot on my mind.

1030
01:17:53,467 --> 01:17:55,374
- You wouldn't do anything.
- What do you want me to do?

1031
01:17:55,474 --> 01:17:56,751
- Be reasonable.
- Get somebody else to…

1032
01:17:56,851 --> 01:17:58,766
- Do you expect me to give myself up?
- Why not?

1033
01:17:58,866 --> 01:18:01,891
It's a far, far better thing that
I do, with the old limelight, the

1034
01:18:01,991 --> 01:18:05,117
fall of the curtain. No.
Holly, you and I aren't heroes.

1035
01:18:05,230 --> 01:18:06,653
The world doesn't make any heroes...

1036
01:18:06,753 --> 01:18:08,695
- You've got plenty of contacts.
- ...outside of your stories.

1037
01:18:08,795 --> 01:18:10,964
I've got to be so careful.

1038
01:18:11,064 --> 01:18:14,740
I'm only safe in the Russian zone. I'm only
safe here as long as they can use me.

1039
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:17,463
- As long as they can use you?
- I wish I could get rid of this thing.

1040
01:18:17,564 --> 01:18:21,427
So that's how they found out about Anna.
You told them, didn't you?

1041
01:18:21,528 --> 01:18:23,468
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.

1042
01:18:23,569 --> 01:18:25,551
- What do you expect me to be? Part of your...
- Part?

1043
01:18:25,651 --> 01:18:27,611
You can have any part you want
as long as you don't interfere.

1044
01:18:27,711 --> 01:18:29,796
I've never cut you out of anything.

1045
01:18:29,896 --> 01:18:33,039
Yes, I remember when they raided the
gambling joint, you knew a safe way out.

1046
01:18:33,139 --> 01:18:36,883
- Sure!
- Yeah, safe for you. Not safe for me.

1047
01:18:36,983 --> 01:18:40,149
Old man, you never should have
gone to the police, you know.

1048
01:18:41,828 --> 01:18:43,433
You ought to leave this thing alone.

1049
01:18:44,631 --> 01:18:47,493
Have you ever seen any of your victims?

1050
01:18:47,594 --> 01:18:50,937
You know, I never feel comfortable
on these sort of things.

1051
01:18:51,037 --> 01:18:53,485
Victims? Don't be melodramatic.

1052
01:18:55,401 --> 01:18:56,407
Tell me.

1053
01:18:57,323 --> 01:19:01,697
Would you really feel any pity
if one of those dots stopped moving forever?

1054
01:19:02,671 --> 01:19:05,632
If I offered you £20,000
for every dot that stopped,

1055
01:19:05,732 --> 01:19:07,914
would you really, old man,
tell me to keep my money?

1056
01:19:08,015 --> 01:19:12,183
Or would you calculate how many
dots you could afford to spare?

1057
01:19:12,298 --> 01:19:15,191
Free of income tax, old man.
Free of income tax.

1058
01:19:15,903 --> 01:19:18,004
The only way you can
save money nowadays.

1059
01:19:18,104 --> 01:19:19,687
A lot of good your money
will do you in jail.

1060
01:19:19,787 --> 01:19:21,598
That jail's in another zone.

1061
01:19:22,690 --> 01:19:24,294
There's no proof against me...

1062
01:19:25,572 --> 01:19:26,938
Besides you.

1063
01:19:35,102 --> 01:19:37,106
I should be pretty easy to get rid of.

1064
01:19:39,346 --> 01:19:40,633
Pretty easy.

1065
01:19:41,148 --> 01:19:42,435
I wouldn't be too sure.

1066
01:19:43,230 --> 01:19:44,677
I carry a gun.

1067
01:19:45,713 --> 01:19:48,879
I don't think they'd look for a bullet wound
after you hit that ground.

1068
01:19:51,558 --> 01:19:52,766
They dug up your coffin.

1069
01:19:57,324 --> 01:19:58,771
And found Harbin?

1070
01:20:03,971 --> 01:20:05,258
Mmm-hmm.

1071
01:20:08,095 --> 01:20:09,156
Pity.

1072
01:20:09,490 --> 01:20:11,118
Holly.

1073
01:20:11,218 --> 01:20:13,721
What fools we are
talking to each other this way

1074
01:20:13,821 --> 01:20:16,563
as though I'd do anything to you
or you to me.

1075
01:20:16,664 --> 01:20:19,398
You're just a little mixed up
about things in general.

1076
01:20:19,507 --> 01:20:23,211
Nobody thinks in terms of human beings.

1077
01:20:23,311 --> 01:20:24,853
Governments don't. Why should we?

1078
01:20:24,953 --> 01:20:27,135
They talk about the people
and the proletariat.

1079
01:20:27,235 --> 01:20:30,578
I talk about the suckers and the mugs.
It's the same thing.

1080
01:20:30,679 --> 01:20:35,023
They have their five-year plans,
and so have I.

1081
01:20:35,123 --> 01:20:36,615
You used to believe in God.

1082
01:20:37,886 --> 01:20:40,573
Oh, I still do believe in God, old man.

1083
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:45,113
I believe in God and mercy and all that.

1084
01:20:45,213 --> 01:20:50,670
But, the dead are happier dead.
They don't miss much here, poor devils.

1085
01:20:54,863 --> 01:20:56,708
What do you believe in?

1086
01:20:56,985 --> 01:21:02,030
Well, if you ever get Anna out of this mess,
be kind to her. You'll find she's worth it.

1087
01:21:02,130 --> 01:21:05,533
I wish I had asked you to bring me
some of those tablets from home.

1088
01:21:05,634 --> 01:21:08,526
Holly, I would like
to cut you in, old man.

1089
01:21:09,357 --> 01:21:11,139
There's nobody left
in Vienna I can really trust,

1090
01:21:11,239 --> 01:21:13,541
and we have always done
everything together.

1091
01:21:13,642 --> 01:21:15,183
When you make up your mind,
send me a message.

1092
01:21:15,283 --> 01:21:16,945
I'll meet you any place, any time.

1093
01:21:17,045 --> 01:21:21,338
And when we do meet, old man,
it is you I want to see, not the police.

1094
01:21:22,090 --> 01:21:23,832
Remember that, won't you?

1095
01:21:23,932 --> 01:21:27,941
And don't be so gloomy.
After all, it's not that awful.

1096
01:21:28,177 --> 01:21:30,199
Remember what the fellow said.

1097
01:21:30,299 --> 01:21:32,121
In Italy, for 30 years under the Borgias

1098
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:34,964
they had warfare, terror, murder
and bloodshed,

1099
01:21:35,064 --> 01:21:38,688
but they produced Michelangelo,
Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance.

1100
01:21:38,788 --> 01:21:41,050
In Switzerland, they had brotherly love.

1101
01:21:41,150 --> 01:21:47,336
They had 500 years of democracy and peace,
and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.

1102
01:21:47,436 --> 01:21:48,724
So long, Holly.

1103
01:21:57,170 --> 01:21:59,588
But, look here, Martins.
You can always arrange to meet him at

1104
01:21:59,689 --> 01:22:02,501
at some little cafe
here in the international zone.

1105
01:22:02,613 --> 01:22:04,456
- It wouldn't work.
- We'll never get him in the Russian zone.

1106
01:22:04,574 --> 01:22:06,625
Calloway, you expect too much.

1107
01:22:07,417 --> 01:22:10,867
Oh, I know he deserves to hang,
you proved your stuff. But

1108
01:22:11,781 --> 01:22:13,911
20 years is a long time.

1109
01:22:14,224 --> 01:22:15,750
Don't ask me to tie the rope.

1110
01:22:16,666 --> 01:22:18,238
Okay, forget it.

1111
01:22:20,030 --> 01:22:22,132
- Busy, Major?
- What is it, Brodsky?

1112
01:22:22,232 --> 01:22:25,001
We have identified the girl.
Here is her report.

1113
01:22:27,132 --> 01:22:29,940
I've questioned her.
We've got nothing against her.

1114
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:33,022
We shall apply for her
at the Four Power meeting tomorrow.

1115
01:22:33,122 --> 01:22:34,330
She has no right to be here.

1116
01:22:37,274 --> 01:22:39,524
I've asked your people
to help with Lime.

1117
01:22:39,624 --> 01:22:41,431
That's a different case.

1118
01:22:41,531 --> 01:22:44,714
It is being looked into.
So long, Major.

1119
01:22:46,456 --> 01:22:51,308
In the last war, a general would
hang his opponent's picture on the wall.

1120
01:22:52,062 --> 01:22:53,924
He got to know him that way.

1121
01:22:54,024 --> 01:22:56,108
I'm beginning to know Lime.

1122
01:22:57,308 --> 01:23:00,679
I think this would have worked,
with your help.

1123
01:23:07,919 --> 01:23:09,409
What price would you pay?

1124
01:23:16,047 --> 01:23:17,288
Name it.

1125
01:23:46,531 --> 01:23:49,504
Here we are. You'll be
all right here, miss.

1126
01:23:53,247 --> 01:23:55,349
I don't understand Major Calloway.

1127
01:23:55,458 --> 01:23:57,208
I expect he's got
a soft spot for you, miss.

1128
01:23:57,308 --> 01:23:59,250
Why has he done all this?

1129
01:23:59,350 --> 01:24:02,518
Don't you worry, miss.
You're well out of things.

1130
01:24:03,034 --> 01:24:04,800
There we are, miss.

1131
01:24:05,517 --> 01:24:08,729
- Thank you, you have been so kind.
- Well, I'll be saying good night.

1132
01:24:11,163 --> 01:24:12,784
- Good night, miss.
- Goodbye.

1133
01:24:51,483 --> 01:24:52,896
Are you going, too?

1134
01:24:53,966 --> 01:24:55,093
Oh...

1135
01:24:56,054 --> 01:24:57,234
What are you doing here?

1136
01:24:57,334 --> 01:24:59,079
I wanted to see you off.

1137
01:24:59,451 --> 01:25:00,899
See me off? From here?

1138
01:25:01,053 --> 01:25:05,170
Oh, I watched you out on the train.
Uh, no harm in that, is there?

1139
01:25:05,739 --> 01:25:07,184
How did you know I would be here?

1140
01:25:07,616 --> 01:25:10,905
I heard something about it
at police headquarters.

1141
01:25:12,425 --> 01:25:14,556
Have you been seeing
Major Calloway again?

1142
01:25:14,947 --> 01:25:17,430
Of course not. I don't live
in his pocket.

1143
01:25:19,272 --> 01:25:20,798
Harry, what is it?

1144
01:25:22,101 --> 01:25:24,434
For heaven's sake,
stop calling me Harry.

1145
01:25:24,534 --> 01:25:26,498
I'm sorry.

1146
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:27,922
Hey, come on.

1147
01:25:28,022 --> 01:25:29,531
What is on your mind?
Why did you hide here?

1148
01:25:29,631 --> 01:25:31,504
Hide? Can't a fellow
have a drink?

1149
01:25:31,605 --> 01:25:34,086
- Here, it will be cold on that train.
- I shall be all right.

1150
01:25:34,186 --> 01:25:35,829
You send me a wire
as soon as you are.

1151
01:25:35,929 --> 01:25:37,309
What is going to happen?
Where is Harry?

1152
01:25:37,410 --> 01:25:39,872
- He's safe in the Russian zone.
- How do you know?

1153
01:25:39,972 --> 01:25:41,755
- Oh, I saw him today.
- How is he?

1154
01:25:41,855 --> 01:25:43,526
He can look after himself,
don't worry.

1155
01:25:43,626 --> 01:25:46,239
- Did he say anything about me? Tell me.
- Oh, the usual things.

1156
01:25:46,339 --> 01:25:48,715
There's something wrong.
Did you tell Calloway about meeting Harry?

1157
01:25:48,815 --> 01:25:50,884
- Of course I didn't tell Calloway.
- Why should he help me like that?

1158
01:25:50,984 --> 01:25:53,166
- The Russians will only make trouble for him.
- Oh, that's his headache.

1159
01:25:53,266 --> 01:25:54,247
- His?
- Oh, well.

1160
01:25:54,347 --> 01:25:55,328
Why are you lying?

1161
01:25:55,428 --> 01:25:56,938
We're getting you
out of here, aren't we?

1162
01:25:57,038 --> 01:25:58,131
I'm not going.

1163
01:25:58,231 --> 01:25:59,394
You...

1164
01:26:00,463 --> 01:26:03,948
Anna, don't you recognise a good turn
when you see one?

1165
01:26:04,226 --> 01:26:06,600
You have seen Calloway.
What are you two doing?

1166
01:26:08,718 --> 01:26:10,153
Well, they

1167
01:26:10,553 --> 01:26:12,989
they asked me to help take him,

1168
01:26:13,661 --> 01:26:14,981
and I'm helping.

1169
01:26:23,738 --> 01:26:25,103
Poor Harry.

1170
01:26:25,593 --> 01:26:27,005
Poor Harry?

1171
01:26:29,022 --> 01:26:30,665
Poor Harry

1172
01:26:31,404 --> 01:26:33,257
wouldn't even lift
a finger to help you.

1173
01:26:34,317 --> 01:26:37,320
Oh, you've got your precious honesty
and don't want anything else.

1174
01:26:38,106 --> 01:26:39,319
You still want him.

1175
01:26:39,710 --> 01:26:41,411
I don't want him any more.

1176
01:26:41,511 --> 01:26:45,684
I don't want to see him, hear him,
but he is still part of me. That's a fact.

1177
01:26:47,056 --> 01:26:49,668
I couldn't do a thing to harm him.

1178
01:27:08,564 --> 01:27:10,892
Oh, Anna, why do we always

1179
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:13,276
have to quarrel?

1180
01:27:13,376 --> 01:27:17,781
If you want to sell your services,
I'm not willing to be the price.

1181
01:27:20,329 --> 01:27:22,845
I loved him. You loved him.

1182
01:27:23,523 --> 01:27:25,329
What good have we done him?

1183
01:27:25,694 --> 01:27:26,902
Love.

1184
01:27:29,088 --> 01:27:33,421
Look at yourself.
They have a name for faces like that.

1185
01:27:55,319 --> 01:27:56,732
- Oh, Calloway.
- Oh, there you are.

1186
01:27:56,832 --> 01:27:59,414
- Come in here, there isn't much time.
- I want to get a plane out of here tonight.

1187
01:28:01,116 --> 01:28:04,063
- So she talked you out of it.
- She gave me these.

1188
01:28:05,228 --> 01:28:06,835
A girl of spirit.

1189
01:28:07,242 --> 01:28:08,734
She's right.

1190
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:11,054
It is none of my business.

1191
01:28:11,446 --> 01:28:13,790
It won't make any
difference in the long run.

1192
01:28:14,209 --> 01:28:15,554
I'll get him.

1193
01:28:15,984 --> 01:28:17,647
Well, I won't have helped.

1194
01:28:17,747 --> 01:28:19,876
That'll be a fine boast to make.

1195
01:28:20,354 --> 01:28:22,599
Well, I always wanted you
to catch that plane, didn't I?

1196
01:28:22,699 --> 01:28:23,901
You all did.

1197
01:28:24,456 --> 01:28:28,190
I'd better see if there's anyone still
at the terminus. You may need a priority.

1198
01:28:30,066 --> 01:28:32,248
Do you mind if I drop off
somewhere on the way?

1199
01:28:32,348 --> 01:28:34,394
I've got an appointment,
it won't take five minutes.

1200
01:28:34,494 --> 01:28:36,411
- Of course.
- Why don't you come in, too?

1201
01:28:36,512 --> 01:28:38,562
You're a writer. It might interest you.

1202
01:28:39,876 --> 01:28:42,498
This is the biggest children's hospital
in Vienna.

1203
01:28:42,599 --> 01:28:46,162
All the kids in here are the result
of Lime's penicillin racket.

1204
01:29:06,623 --> 01:29:10,518
It had meningitis.
They gave it some of Lime's penicillin.

1205
01:29:12,287 --> 01:29:13,959
Terribly pity, isn't it?

1206
01:29:40,938 --> 01:29:44,833
Paine lent me one of your books,
Oklahoma Kid, I think it was.

1207
01:29:44,942 --> 01:29:47,892
I read a bit of it. Looks as if
it's going to be pretty good.

1208
01:29:47,992 --> 01:29:50,550
What made you take up
this sort of thing?

1209
01:29:50,633 --> 01:29:52,098
Been doing it for long?

1210
01:29:52,198 --> 01:29:53,461
All right, Calloway. You win.

1211
01:29:53,561 --> 01:29:55,463
I never knew there were
snake charmers in Texas.

1212
01:29:55,563 --> 01:29:57,647
- I said, you win.
- Win what?

1213
01:29:58,956 --> 01:30:02,447
I'll be your dumb decoy duck.

1214
01:30:56,735 --> 01:30:57,862
Psst!

1215
01:31:08,106 --> 01:31:09,268
Paine.

1216
01:31:36,055 --> 01:31:37,182
Look, sir.

1217
01:31:44,744 --> 01:31:46,525
How much longer
are you going to sit here?

1218
01:31:46,626 --> 01:31:48,355
Shall I go over there, sir?

1219
01:31:48,668 --> 01:31:51,171
No, no. Leave them for a while.

1220
01:32:13,773 --> 01:32:15,584
Nein, danke. Nein.

1221
01:32:19,046 --> 01:32:21,227
Balloons?

1222
01:32:22,450 --> 01:32:24,139
Go on, hop it, scarper!

1223
01:32:33,192 --> 01:32:34,815
Come on.

1224
01:32:34,915 --> 01:32:38,226
All right, all right. Only one.
Go on, scarper.

1225
01:33:16,396 --> 01:33:18,207
You should have gone.

1226
01:33:18,358 --> 01:33:21,365
- How did you know I was here anyway?
- From Kurtz.

1227
01:33:22,031 --> 01:33:23,784
They have just been arrested.

1228
01:33:23,884 --> 01:33:26,777
But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.

1229
01:33:27,047 --> 01:33:29,970
Yes, Paine. Slip over there.
See what she is up to.

1230
01:33:30,070 --> 01:33:31,072
Right, sir.

1231
01:33:31,172 --> 01:33:34,179
Don't tell me
you're doing all this for nothing.

1232
01:33:36,092 --> 01:33:37,397
What is your price this time?

1233
01:33:37,497 --> 01:33:38,639
No price, Anna.

1234
01:33:38,739 --> 01:33:43,226
Honest, sensible, sober,
harmless Holly Martins.

1235
01:33:44,424 --> 01:33:47,112
Holly, what a silly name.

1236
01:33:47,909 --> 01:33:51,234
You must feel very proud
to be a police informer.

1237
01:33:54,235 --> 01:33:56,444
Harry, get away! The police are outside.

1238
01:33:57,278 --> 01:33:58,725
- Quick!
- Anna.

1239
01:34:04,526 --> 01:34:05,674
Shoot him!

1240
01:34:05,774 --> 01:34:06,902
In the back!

1241
01:35:07,389 --> 01:35:08,391
All right.

1242
01:35:19,228 --> 01:35:20,814
Martins, get back!

1243
01:39:33,818 --> 01:39:34,820
Harry!

1244
01:39:37,873 --> 01:39:40,039
- Is that you?
- You're through, Harry.

1245
01:39:40,139 --> 01:39:42,320
Come out! You haven't
got a chance this way.

1246
01:39:42,420 --> 01:39:44,838
- What do you want?
- You might as well give up.

1247
01:39:45,905 --> 01:39:48,267
Mr Martins, sir, get back!
Get back!

1248
01:39:48,367 --> 01:39:50,017
Keep back, sir, come back!

1249
01:39:50,117 --> 01:39:51,358
Hey, come back, sir!

1250
01:41:27,095 --> 01:41:29,500
Martins! Martins!

1251
01:41:29,779 --> 01:41:31,019
Be careful, Martins!

1252
01:41:32,310 --> 01:41:35,363
Don't take any chances!
If you see him, shoot!

1253
01:42:37,173 --> 01:42:38,744
What time is it?

1254
01:42:40,658 --> 01:42:41,860
2:30.

1255
01:42:45,134 --> 01:42:48,286
I'll have to step on it,
if you're going to catch that plane.

1256
01:42:49,018 --> 01:42:51,911
Calloway, can't you
do something about Anna?

1257
01:42:52,982 --> 01:42:55,552
I'll do what I can,
if she'll let me.

1258
01:43:06,123 --> 01:43:09,482
- Wait a minute. Let me out.
- Well, there's not much time.

1259
01:43:10,121 --> 01:43:13,605
One can't just leave. Please.

1260
01:43:15,155 --> 01:43:16,966
Be sensible, Martins.

1261
01:43:17,644 --> 01:43:20,411
I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.

1262
01:45:05,001 --> 01:45:07,501
