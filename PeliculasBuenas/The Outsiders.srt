Don't worry. We're gonna have it
out with them sooner or later.

- I wanna go.
- Oh, we're taking Evie and Sandy.

103
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:12,189
- Which means no kids allowed.
- Big deal.

104
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,904
Nah, nah, nah. I'm gonna
go hunt some action.

105

00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,699

- A little.

134
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,501

135
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,925
He don't mean nothing.

136
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:44,054

a lot of responsibilities

137

you're out of school, though,

150
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,939

anyway. What's your name?

248

Ponyboy Curtis.

249
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,910
That's an original name.

250
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,580
Yeah, my dad, he was
an original person.

251
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:12,292
I got a brother named Sodapop. It
says so on his birth certificate.

252
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:18,507
My name's Sherry, but my friends
call me Cherry cos of my hair.

253
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,138
I know. We go to the same
school. You're a cheerleader.

254
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,594
Yeah.

255
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,259
You don't look old enough
to be going to high school.

256
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,475
What's a nice boy like you doing
hanging around with that trash?

257
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,559
Dally's my buddy.
I'm a Greaser, too.

258
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:35,570
- We're all friends.
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.

259
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,369
Your brother, Sodapop, he works at

260
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,368
the gasoline station,
right? At DX.

261
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,778
Yeah, that's him.

262
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,446
Yeah, Soda's the cute one.

263
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,741
I should have known
you were brothers.

264
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:53,334
Hey, how come we don't see your
brother at school any more?

265
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:58,009
Has he been working full time
since your parents died?

266
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:01,671
- He's a dropout.
- Oh, that's too bad.

267
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,181
Here. I thought this
might cool you off.

268
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,889
Maybe that will cool
you off, Greaser.

269
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,854
When you learn to talk and act
decent, I might cool off, too.

270
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,609
Fiery, huh? Just the
way I like them.

271
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,896
- Get off me.
- Come on.

272
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,281
Look, leave her alone, Dal.

273
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,318
What did you say?

274
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,488
Come on. You heard
me. Leave her alone.

275
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:31,000
What did you say, you little
shit? What did you say?

276
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,252
- Come on.
- You wise ass.

277
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,173
Hey, wise guy, cool it, will you?

278
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,305
Sit down, punk.

279
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,686

280
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,816
Thank you. He had
me scared to death.

281
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:00,104
You sure didn't show it.
Nobody talks to Dal like that.

282
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,361
From what I saw, you do.

283
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:06,824
Why don't you all come sit here
with us so you can protect us?

284
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,873
- What do you think, man? Come on.
- Might as well.

285
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,417
How old are you all?

286
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,297
- 14.
- 16.

287
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,083
I thought you were both 14.

288
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,839
How come you all ain't scared
of us like you was of Dally?

289
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:30,305
Oh, you two are too
sweet-looking to scare anyone.

290
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:33,141
Besides, I know about
Dallas Winston.

291
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,981
You two don't look mean.

292
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:39,986
Yeah, right. We're
young and innocent.

293
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,989
No. You're just not dirty.

294
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,445
Come on, Dal's ok. I mean,
he's tough and all.

295
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,486
But he's a cool old guy,
if you get to know him.

296
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,700
He'd leave you alone if
he knew who you were.

297
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,275
Well, I'm glad he doesn't know us.

298
00:20:53,276 --> 00:20:54,834
I kind of admire him.

299
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,084
Oi, Greaser. You're dead.

300
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,044
What's he doing? Get
out of my hair.

301
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,675
Hey, what have you done?

302
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:06,212
Here, kid, have a beer.
It'll settle your nerves.

303
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:11,305
Well, now, who we got here?
Your great-grandmothers, huh?

304
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:14,687
What are you two young ladies
hanging out with these Greasers?

305
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,813
Dal was bothering them.

306
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,099
- He was, huh?
- Yeah.

307
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,268
Where is old Dal now anyway?

308
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:23,271
Yeah, where is old Dally?

309
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,570
He left, Tim.

310
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,700
Hey, I know he slashed my tyres.

311
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,158
Look, Tim, he left.
He's not here. Really.

312
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:37,998
- You guys seen Dally?
- No, no.

313
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,710
Yeah, well, I'll be
looking for him.

314
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,838
- Dally got a blade?
- I don't think so.

315
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,723
Good deal. Tim will fight
fair as long as he don't.

316
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,728
You guys don't believe in
playing rough, do you?

317
00:21:56,899 --> 00:22:00,357
- Well, a fair fight ain't rough.
- Yeah, boy. Real simple.

318
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:02,843
Yeah. If he gets
killed or something,

319
00:22:02,844 --> 00:22:04,612
you just bury him. No sweat.

320
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,000
You dig, ok, baby.
You want a chew?

321
00:22:09,001 --> 00:22:10,409
Come on, Two-Bit.

322
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,570
Help yourself. Put
hair on your chest.

323
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,915
Ponyboy, come with me and
get some Cokes and popcorn.

324
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,496
Sure.

325
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:20,161
- You all want some?
- I do.

326
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:24,048
Yeah, me, too. Get Johnny
some, too. I'm buying.

327
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:25,458
Here you go.

328
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:31,096
Your friend, the one with
the sideburns, is he ok?

329
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,974
Yeah, he ain't dangerous,
if that's what you mean.

330
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:38,224
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Hey, man.

331
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,685
He sure scared Johnny.

332
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:44,227
Johnny's a nervous wreck anyway.

333
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:47,693
He got beat up a few
months ago by some Soc.

334
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,442
Is that how he got his scar?

335
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,702
Yeah, the guy was
wearing a few rings.

336
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,665
- Not all of us are like that.
- Sure.

337
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:02,294
That's like saying all you
Greasers are like Dallas Winston.

338
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,830
- Leave him, will you?
- What you gonna do about it?

339
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,546
Let's take it outside.
That's what I'll do.

340
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,212
All right, you two. Why don't
you both take it outside?

341
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,802
Well, he's jumped a few people.

342
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:18,515
Anyway, you think the
Socs have it made.

343
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:22,432
The rich kids. The southside Soc.

344
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,067
Well, I'll tell you
something, Ponyboy,

345
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:29,150
and it might come as a surprise,
but things are rough all over.

346
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,276
Come on. Let's get out of here.

347
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:35,661
Or Two-Bit will think
we eloped to Mexico.

348
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,676
So, you're from the
southside, huh?

349
00:23:39,677 --> 00:23:40,701
Yes.

350
00:23:40,702 --> 00:23:43,419
- It must be a nice neighbourhood.
- It is. I like it.

351
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,125
Do you?

352
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:48,257
Yeah, I'm from
the other side of town.

353
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:14,196
Tell me about your oldest brother.
You never seem to talk about him.

354
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,782
What's to tell?

355
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,117
He's big and roofs houses.

356
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,373
No, really. I mean,
what's he like?

357
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:24,034
I feel like I know Soda for as
much as you talk about him.

358
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,704
Tell me about Darry. Is he
wild and reckless like Soda?

359
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,873
Or dreamy like you?

360
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:34,173
He ain't like Soda, and
he sure ain't like me.

361
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,179
He can't stand me.

362
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,369
I bet he wishes he
could stick me in

363
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,264
some boys' home.
Soda won't let him.

364
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:44,680
- What are you talking about?
- Come on. You all get along fine.

365
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,708
No, we don't. You
shut your trap, cos

366
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:48,316
you ain't wanted at home either.

367
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,977
You shut your mouth, kid.

368
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,279
I'm sorry. I got a little mad.

369
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,281
Don't worry about it.

370
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,717
We couldn't get along without you.

371
00:24:57,718 --> 00:24:58,718
Marcia.

372
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,621
- Look who's coming.
- What are we gonna do?

373
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:04,659
- Just act normal. Just keep calm.
- Who are these clowns?

374
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,545
Cherry, what's going on?

375
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,331
What are you doing?

376
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:14,630
Just because we got
a little drunk...

377
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:17,968
You call reeling and passing
out on the streets "a little"?

378
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:19,427
Bob, I've told you before,

379
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,343
I'm never going out with
you when you're drinking.

380
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,354
That's no reason to go walking
the streets with these bums.

381
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,480
- Who are you calling bums, pal?
- You.

382
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:28,758
Randy.

383
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:30,484
We got two more in the back seat.

384
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,862
- Pity the back seat.
- If you're looking for a fight...

385
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:37,116
I am looking for a fight.
Let's go. Come on. Right not.

386
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:38,776
Come on.

387
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,115
All right. We'll go with
you. Just wait a minute.

388
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,544
We ain't scared of these bastards.

389
00:25:43,545 --> 00:25:45,374
I hate fights. I hate them.

390
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:47,951
Come here, Ponyboy.

391
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,166
I'm sorry.

392
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:56,426
Look, I couldn't use this.
I could never cut no one.

393
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:58,053
Cherry. Come on.

394
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,179
We'd better go with them.

395
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,463
If I see you in school and I don't

396
00:26:07,464 --> 00:26:09,349
say hi, don't take
it personal, ok?

397
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,062
Yeah, I know.

398
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,818
Really. You're a nice
boy and everything.

399
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,525
It's ok.

400
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,404
I hope I never see
Dallas Winston again.

401
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,119
If I do, I'll probably
fall in love with him.

402
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,079

Probably a phoney one, too.

bottle. You never

00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:24,424

455
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:10,089

went to sleep, too.

457
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,397

Yeah, it's Darry.

462
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,212
Yeah. Bye.

463
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:50,880
Where the hell have you been?
Do you know what time it is?

464
00:30:51,058 --> 00:30:53,140
It's two o'clock in
the morning, kiddo.

465
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,471
- Where have you been?
- I feel asleep in the lot.

466
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,385
- You what?
- I was talking to Johnny.

467
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,101
And I fell asleep in the
lot. I didn't mean to.

468
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,891
And I can't even call the cops

469
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,561
because you two would be
thrown in boys' home so fast,

470
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,104
it would make your head spin.

471
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,998
Come on, Pony. Let's
go to bed now.

472
00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:10,490
Look, I said I didn't mean to.

473
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,493
"I didn't mean to." "I forgot."
That's all I ever hear from you.

474
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:14,692
Come on, Darry...

475
00:31:14,693 --> 00:31:16,700
Tired of you sticking up for him.

476
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,912
Don't you yell at him.

477
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,874
Ponyboy. I didn't mean to.

478
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:40,429
Come on, Johnny.
Move out of the way.

479
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:54,754
Take it easy, Pony. It will be all

480
00:31:54,755 --> 00:31:56,821
right. You just have
to cool it, man.

481
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,865
Got a cigarette, Johnny?
I'm scared to death.

482
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,876
Well, don't be, man.
You're scaring me.

483
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,833
- What happened?
- Darry hit me.

484
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,623
I swear we used to get along
fine until Mum and Dad died.

485
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:10,758
Now he can't stand me.

486
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,466
I think I like it better when
the old man's hitting me.

487
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,551
At least he knows I'm there.

488
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,472
Let's walk to the park and back.

489
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,978
Maybe I'll cool off
enough to go home.

490
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:25,892
Yeah, all right. Ain't you
about to freeze to death?

491
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,023
You're ain't a' woofing.

492
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,633

493
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:06,022
Pony, got a light?

494
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:09,063
Found this butt, man.

495
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,569
Yeah, here you go, Johnny.

496
00:33:13,966 --> 00:33:15,402
Look what's coming.

497
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,076
This is our territory.

498
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,237
I bet they're looking for us.

499
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,041
- Wanna split?
- Stay cool.

500
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:31,882
Well, well, well. What
do you guys know?

501
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:33,508
They're drunk.

502
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,512
It's that guy with the rings, man.

503
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:43,768
Aren't these the Greasers who
tried to pick up our women?

504
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:47,313
You guys are out of your
territory. You better watch it.

505
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:48,974
No, pal. You better watch it.

506
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,871
You guys know what Greasers are?

507
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,783
White trash with long greasy hair.

508
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,794
- You know what a Soc is?
- What?

509
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:20,965
White trash with
Mustangs and madras.

510
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,348
Get them.

511
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,314
Johnny.

512
00:34:32,828 --> 00:34:34,314
Stay down, pal.

513
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,604
Chuck him.

514
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:51,369
Grab his arms. Right down.

515
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:58,631
Did somebody get a drink
for this Greaser, huh?

516
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,638
Come on. Have a drink, pal.

517
00:35:57,364 --> 00:36:00,731
I killed him.

518
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,737
I killed that boy.

519
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,744
I killed him.

520
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,714
Johnny, I think I'm gonna be sick.

521
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,973
Go ahead, man. I ain't... I
ain't gonna look at you.

522
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:29,850
Ain't gonna look at you.

523
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:43,064
Pony, are you all right?

524
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:48,654
You really did kill
them, huh, Johnny?

525
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,040
Yeah.

526
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:57,499
I had to.

527
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:02,209
They, they were drowning you,
and they might have killed you.

528
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:08,344
They were gonna beat me up.

529
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,978
- What happened to the other guys?
- Huh?

530
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:18,725
They... they all ran.
They all ran off.

531
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,110
When I stabbed him, they all ran.

532
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,563
What do you boys want?

533
00:37:55,732 --> 00:37:59,191
Dally. We got to see Dally.

534
00:37:59,192 --> 00:38:00,442
He's busy.

535
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:04,070
Just tell him it's Ponyboy
and Johnny, man. He'll come.

536
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,399
Come on.

537
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,635
What do you guys want?

538
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:30,513
- Johnny killed the Socs.
- What?

539
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,433
All right. Good for you. Let's go.

540
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:37,141
We figured you could get us
out, if anyone could, Dal.

541
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,899
I'm sorry I got you away
from this party and all,

542
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:43,151
but I just don't know
what to do, man.

543
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,027
I was just trying
to get some sleep.

544
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:47,154
I got into a fight
with Shepard tonight.

545
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,067
Let's see what we can do
about this mess. Get in.

546
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:52,577
- Ponyboy, are you wet?
- Yeah, I'm ok.

547
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:58,412
Hey, hey. Pony, come on, man.

548
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:02,462
You'll die of pneumonia before
the cops ever get to you.

549
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:09,465
Come on.

550
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:12,756
Hey, stupid, take the
sweatshirt off, will you, man?

551
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:14,515
You'll freeze to death.

552
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,685
Man, I wish I had a weed now.

553
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:26,019
Here. Don't point the
thing at me, will you?

554
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,812
It's loaded. Come on.

555
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,453
Here you go. That's 50 bucks.

556
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,476
Look, I'm not gonna
tell your brother

557
00:39:38,477 --> 00:39:40,037
and get my head kicked in, man.

558
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,917
Then don't tell him.

559
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:45,831
Here. It's Buck's. It's big on
you, but it's dry. Come here.

560
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:54,013
Get the 3.15 train to
Windrixville. It's a freight.

561
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,972
There's an abandoned church
on top of Jay Mountain.

562
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:02,772
There's a pump in the back, so you
don't have to worry about water.

563
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,902
Get a week's supply of food,
as soon as you get there,

564
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,530
before the story gets out.

565
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:17,475
And then don't so
much as stick your

566
00:40:17,476 --> 00:40:19,080
noses out the door. Am I clear?

567
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,786
Yeah.

568
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,576
I'll be up there as soon as
I think everything's cool.

569
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:26,542
Hey, relax, buddy. Come
on, man. It'll work out.

570
00:40:28,343 --> 00:40:29,753
All right.

571
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,800
Man, I thought New York
was the only place

572
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,259
I'd end up in a murder wrap.

573

He couldn't have
been more than 17,

707
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:53,164
maybe 18 years old,
and I killed him.

How would you like to
live with that, huh?

709
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:58,968

You ought to go home, Ponyboy.

715
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,455
You can't get into any trouble.
You didn't go kill him.

No. I'm 14 and I've
been 14 for a month.

The president of the
United States of America.

801

He really wanted me to
give that to you, man.

803

I guess you got into
some trouble, huh?

804
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:20,452
Darry's awfully sorry he hit
you. You know he didn't mean it

station know me by now.

813
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:48,689
While I was there, they beat it
out of me that you guys were...

814
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:51,726
Get this one. That you guys
were headed for Texas, man.

815

824

- Watch it.
- I got it.

825
00:59:25,771 --> 00:59:28,478

- Don't, Dal. Watch it.

826
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:31,811
I hope you guys are in the
mood for barbecue, man.

827
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:33,941
- Jerk.
- Trying to kill us?

828
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:38,947
Can we have three barbecue
sandwiches, three Cokes and a...?

829
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:46,704
You guys really are hungry, huh?

830
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,621
That kid you killed had
plenty of friends.

831
00:59:50,796 --> 00:59:53,208
It's all over town,
Soc against Grease.

832
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,861
Look, I started carrying a heater.

833
00:59:55,862 --> 00:59:57,716
Dal, you kill people with heaters.

834
00:59:57,886 --> 00:59:59,877
Don't worry. It ain't loaded.

835
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:03,343
Hey, mister, do you have 15 cents?

836
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:05,593
Nah, I don't have any money, man.

837
01:00:05,594 --> 01:00:06,598
Are you sure?

838
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:08,431

We're busy here.

839
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:11,062

- Could you go away?

840
01:00:11,233 --> 01:00:13,815
- Do you have a dime?
- Go away. Get out of here.

841
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:17,436
That was a close call.

845
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:29,410
Hey, I didn't tell
you we got a spy.

846
01:00:29,584 --> 01:00:30,824
A spy? Who?

847
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:33,744
Remember that good-looking
broad I tried to pick up

848
01:00:33,922 --> 01:00:36,129
the night you wasted that kid?

849
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:40,542
What's her name? Cherry
something... The redhead?

850
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,883
- Cherry Valance.
- Cherry, the Soc. Yeah.

851
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:46,298
Yeah, we were hanging out
down at a vacant lot,

852
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,683
and she pulls up in a
little old Stinger, right?

853
01:00:48,854 --> 01:00:51,191
I thought that took
a lot of nerve.

854
01:00:51,192 --> 01:00:52,210
Yeah.

855
01:00:52,211 --> 01:00:56,233
She said that she'd testify
that the Socs were drunk,

856
01:00:56,403 --> 01:00:58,644
and they were the ones
looking for the fight.

857
01:00:58,822 --> 01:01:01,689
And you guys just fought back
strictly on self-defence.

858
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:03,107
So, it's cool.

859
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:07,076
Man, that little broad
sure does hate me.

860
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:10,489
I offered to take her for a Coke,
and she told me to go to hell.

861
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:11,952
I don't know.

862
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,284
Yeah.

863
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:17,371
So you think she might
like me a little bit?

864
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:20,507
Huh? I think she's kinda cute.

865
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:24,002
- No?
- Right.

866
01:01:24,181 --> 01:01:27,048
What do they do for kicks
around here? Play checkers?

867
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:28,840
This place is out of it.

868
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:35,604
I've never been to
the country before.

869
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:37,515
We're gonna turn ourselves in.

870
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:39,768
What? What?

871
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:41,811
I got a good chance of
being let off easy.

872
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:43,890
It was self-defence.
You just said.

873
01:01:43,891 --> 01:01:45,528
Pony and Cherry could testify.

874
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:46,942
We won't say you helped us.

875
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,283
I'll give you back that gun. You
won't get into any trouble, Dal.

876
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:51,889
Are you sure this
is what you want?

877
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:52,968
Yeah.

878
01:01:52,969 --> 01:01:54,374
It ain't fair for
Darry and Soda to

879
01:01:54,375 --> 01:01:55,909
worry about Ponyboy all the time.

880
01:01:57,214 --> 01:01:59,267
I guess my folks aren't worrying.

881
01:01:59,268 --> 01:02:01,207
Hey, man, the boys are worried.

882
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:03,796
Two-Bit wanted to go to
Texas to hunt for you.

883
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,507
Dallas, I asked if my
parents asked about me.

884
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:08,137
No, they didn't. So what?

885
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:10,094
Do you think my old
man gives a hang

886
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:13,681
if I'm dead in a car wreck or
drunk or in jail or something?

887
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:17,222
He doesn't care. But that
doesn't bother me none.

888
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:22,690
Come on. You're not
going anywhere.

889
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:32,492
I get you this hideout. I get
you a hangout, man, a hideout.

890
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:37,542
And look at this. You wanna
split. This is just terrific.

891
01:02:38,922 --> 01:02:42,039
Johnny, you don't know what a few
months in jail can do to you.

892
01:02:42,217 --> 01:02:43,252
You get mean in jail.

893
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:46,589
I just don't want to see it happen
to you like it happened to me.

894
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:57,058
- What's going on?
- I wonder how that started?

895
01:02:57,232 --> 01:02:58,972
Jesus Christ.

896
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:10,734
Pony, where are you going?

897
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:12,823
Get over here, man.

898
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:15,313
Gerry, some children are missing.

899
01:03:15,314 --> 01:03:17,116
No, they're not, Theresa.

900
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:19,831
I'm sure of it. Some have
been gone for half an hour.

901
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:24,460
Get a hold of yourself.

902
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:27,546
Come back. Come back. Don't
go in there. You'll get hurt.

903
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:31,133
Come here, man. Get over here.

904
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:35,012
You're gonna get him?

905
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:38,303
Pony.

906
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:40,935
Go back before you get hurt.

907
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:49,739
Whoa.

908
01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:00,534
What was that?

909
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:03,044
- Is that guy coming?
- No.

910
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:06,627
- How come? Too scared?
- No. He's too fat.

911
01:04:16,102 --> 01:04:18,138
Come on, man. In here.

912
01:04:23,902 --> 01:04:26,018
Hey, Dal. Take this
kid, man. Take him.

913
01:04:26,196 --> 01:04:27,433
Are you ok?

914
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:33,024
Pony, give them to Dallas.

915
01:04:33,912 --> 01:04:36,324
Get them and get out.

916
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:42,288
- Johnny.
- Come on, Johnny. Move.

917
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:45,666
Johnny. Come on. Are you crazy?

918
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:50,084
- You're burning.
- Come on, Johnny.

919
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:54,053
- No.
- Johnny.

920
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:01,971
Jesus Christ. Stupid kid.

921
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:07,855
I'm coming, Johnny.

922
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:22,198
- Johnny, Dallas...
- They're all right.

923
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:25,915
They're behind us. They're
in another ambulance.

924
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:30,002
Anyway, you guys are the bravest
kids I've seen in a long time.

925
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:33,296
What, are you guys professional
heroes or something?

926
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:35,302
We're Greasers.

927
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:38,848
- Are... are you kidding me?
- No, I ain't kidding you.

928
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:43,140
Take me to town. You'll
find out pretty fast.

929
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:53,195
You know, you shouldn't
be smoking, son.

930
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:55,322
Why not?

931
01:05:55,493 --> 01:05:59,736
Cos you're a young man, that's
why. It's a bad habit to get into.

932
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:02,364
You're smoking.

933
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:05,659
I'm older than you. I've been
smoking for a long time, too.

934
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:17,470
Pull another stunt like that
again, I'm gonna kill you.

935
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:29,307
Ponyboy.

936
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:34,688
Oh, look at your tough hair.

937
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:37,489
Pony.

938
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,571
Darry, I'm sorry.

939
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:44,159
I thought we lost you,
like we did Mum and Dad.

940
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:54,582
You sure look fine.

941
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:09,514
Let's go, little
brother. We're home.

942
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:10,592
Whoa.

943
01:07:10,608 --> 01:07:13,355
Getting pretty big to be carried.

944
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:45,092
Hi, Tim.

945
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:47,010
Hi, kid.

946
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:51,139
Can I get you some
breakfast or something?

947
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:52,477
No.

948
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:59,530
Thanks for letting
me use your couch.

949
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:02,238
Sure. Any time.

950
01:08:13,515 --> 01:08:14,515
Anybody home?

951
01:08:14,581 --> 01:08:16,832
Yeah, in here. Don't
slam the door.

952
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:24,298
Ponyboy, hey.

953
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:27,594
What you doing? Look what you did.

954
01:08:27,595 --> 01:08:28,604
Whoa.

955
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:30,846
You made me ruin my
eggs, drop my spoon.

956
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:32,855
Look at the blond-headed monkey.

957
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:36,109
I wouldn't have believed it, if
I hadn't seen it in the paper.

958
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:39,442
Tell me, Ponyboy, what's
it like being a hero, huh?

959
01:08:39,616 --> 01:08:40,776
A what?

960
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:43,362
A hero, man. You know,
like a, like a big-shotie.

961
01:08:43,536 --> 01:08:44,992
Beer for breakfast, Two-Bit?

962
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:48,537
What I like is the
"turn hero" bit.

963
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:51,074
They're charging Johnny
with manslaughter?

964
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:54,081
What do they mean,
"if he recovers"?

965
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:58,498
Them kids, they'd have burned to
death, if it hadn't been for you.

966
01:08:58,676 --> 01:09:00,337
Dallas will be mad when he hears

967
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:02,672
they didn't mention
his police record.

968
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:05,593
It's all about us.

969
01:09:07,435 --> 01:09:09,221
Darry, me and Soda.

970
01:09:11,606 --> 01:09:14,097
Not a thing about putting me
and Soda in a boys' home?

971
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:15,606
No way.

972
01:09:15,777 --> 01:09:18,109
No, they ain't putting
me in a boys' home.

973
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:20,611
Oh, hell, Ponyboy, they
don't do that to heroes.

974
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:22,898
Where is Soda and
Super-Dope, anyhow?

975
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:26,951
- Whoa. Morning.
- Shut the door.

976
01:09:28,121 --> 01:09:29,487
The what?

977
01:09:29,666 --> 01:09:31,497
All brawn and no brains.

978
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:33,329
Darry, have you seen my DX shirt?

979
01:09:33,503 --> 01:09:36,540
You got to wear pants, too, buddy.
I think there's a law about that.

980
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:37,715
How about my jeans?

981
01:09:37,716 --> 01:09:39,626
I ironed them. They're
in my closet.

982
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:42,133
- Darry...
- Hurry up. You're gonna be late.

983
01:09:42,303 --> 01:09:46,421
Darry, did you... did you hear
about that juvenile court thing?

984
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:50,724
Yeah, the cops told me last night.

985
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:53,807
Hey, after we stomp
the Socs real good,

986
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:55,958
me and Steve are
gonna throw a party

987
01:09:55,959 --> 01:09:57,724
and everyone's gonna get ripped.

988
01:09:57,902 --> 01:10:01,019
- Where you gonna get the dough?
- I'll think of something.

989
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:07,283
Hey, Two-Bit, Mickey's on TV.

990
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,287
Pony? Pony?

991
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:23,083
You know, I hate to leave
you here by yourself.

992
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:24,922
Maybe I ought to take the day off.

993
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:27,838
I'll be ok. I've stayed by
myself plenty of times.

994
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:30,006
Besides, we can't afford it.

995
01:10:30,184 --> 01:10:32,067
Yeah, but I really ought to stay.

996
01:10:32,068 --> 01:10:33,847
Don't worry. I'll baby-sit him.

997
01:10:34,021 --> 01:10:37,479
Hey, why don't you get a job? Ever
think of getting a job, Two-Bit?

998
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:40,016
Hey, Soda, come on. We
got to get to work.

999
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:44,108
I got to quit smoking, or I
won't make track next year.

1000
01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:46,113
Hey, you all, do up the dishes.

1001
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:48,400
- I'm gonna cut off your hair.
- Lay off.

1002
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:51,365
- Yeah, Two-Bit, lay off.
- He ain't looking so good.

1003
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:54,363
Lazy bum.

1004
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,708
Pony...

1005
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:04,458
You smoke more than a pack today,
and I'll skin you. You understand?

1006
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:06,045
Yeah.

1007
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:09,553
If you carry more than one bundle
of roofing at a time today,

1008
01:11:09,724 --> 01:11:11,931
me and Soda here will
skin you, understand?

1009
01:11:14,562 --> 01:11:16,928
- Hey, say hi to Johnny.
- All right.

1010
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:21,607
- See you later, Pony.
- Ok.

1011
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:27,654
We got to clean up the house.

1012
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:30,111
The cops and reporters
are gonna come by.

1013
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,278
And besides it's
time for the people

1014
01:11:32,279 --> 01:11:33,949
from the state to check on us.

1015
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:37,490
Shoot, this house ain't messy.
You ought to see my house.

1016
01:11:37,668 --> 01:11:39,750
I have, and if you had the
sense of a billy goat,

1017
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:42,754
you'd clean your house up,
instead of bumming around ours.

1018
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:46,633
Shoot, kid. If I ever did that,
my mum would die of shock.

1019
01:11:58,898 --> 01:12:02,686
♪ You know what it takes,
you got it, baby ♪

1020
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:05,522
I would drive, but the
brakes went out on my car.

1021
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:07,937
Almost killed me and
Kathy the other night.

1022
01:12:09,492 --> 01:12:11,949
You ought to meet her
brother. Now, there's a hood.

1023
01:12:12,119 --> 01:12:14,735
Boy, he's so greasy, he
glides when he walks.

1024
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:19,282
He goes to the barber shop for
an oil change, not a haircut.

1025
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:25,956
♪ About my troubles,
troubles, troubles ♪

1026
01:12:27,969 --> 01:12:30,881
♪ When it rains, it really pours ♪

1027
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:32,761
- Stay close.
- What do they want?

1028
01:12:32,932 --> 01:12:35,014
- I don't know.
- How many guys were in the car?

1029
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:38,142
There were five. Come on.
Let's hurry up inside.

1030
01:12:40,398 --> 01:12:41,729
Let's see what they want.

1031
01:12:41,899 --> 01:12:44,891
Why do you want to
see what they want?

1032
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:46,354
Just stay here.

1033
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:58,362
No jabs before the rumble. You
know the rules, ape face.

1034
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:01,203
We know. I wanna talk to you.

1035
01:13:04,130 --> 01:13:05,938
Go ahead. I'll keep my eye on him.

1036
01:13:05,939 --> 01:13:06,942
Come on.

1037
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:10,841
Speaking of the rumble, pal...

1038
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:17,341
I read about you in
the paper. How come?

1039
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:21,969
I don't know. I felt like
playing the superhero.

1040
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:25,185
- I wouldn't have.
- You wouldn't have what?

1041
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:27,645
I would have let those
kids burn to death.

1042
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:31,062
You might not have. You might
have done the same thing.

1043
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:32,525
I don't know.

1044
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:36,659
I just don't know anything
any more, I guess.

1045
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:38,588
I never would have
believed a Greaser

1046
01:13:38,589 --> 01:13:40,071
could pull something like that.

1047
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:42,911
A Greaser didn't have
nothing to do with it.

1048
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:44,701
Check out their pants.

1049
01:13:47,173 --> 01:13:48,629
Do you wanna talk inside?

1050
01:13:49,342 --> 01:13:51,048
Are you boys waiting for a flood?

1051
01:13:54,138 --> 01:13:57,722
I hear they stamp your
face into gorilla cookies.

1052
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,346
- You're funny.
- Oh, yeah?

1053
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:04,186
I couldn't tell this
to anyone else.

1054
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:06,689
My friends, they'd think
I was off my rocker.

1055
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:12,903
That friend of yours, the one
that got burned, he might die.

1056
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:15,614
Yeah.

1057
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:18,463
And tonight, people will get hurt

1058
01:14:18,464 --> 01:14:20,532
at the rumble. Maybe
killed, right?

1059
01:14:25,252 --> 01:14:27,618
You can't win. You
know that, don't you?

1060
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:29,920
It doesn't matter if you whip us,

1061
01:14:30,091 --> 01:14:32,582
you'll still be where you
were before, at the bottom.

1062
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:36,173
We'll still be the lucky ones
at the top with all the breaks.

1063
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:38,963
It doesn't matter.

1064
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:40,902
The Greasers will
still be Greasers,

1065
01:14:40,903 --> 01:14:42,474
and the Socs will still be Socs.

1066
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:44,101
It doesn't matter.

1067
01:14:47,692 --> 01:14:49,478
Anyway, thanks, Greaser.

1068
01:14:52,113 --> 01:14:54,604
Hey, I didn't mean that.
I meant, thanks, kid.

1069
01:14:57,034 --> 01:15:00,618
It's been nice talking to you,
Randy. My name's Ponyboy.

1070
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:12,955
You're real funny, Two-Bit.
Come on, Let's go.

1071
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:17,050
- Now get the hell out of here.
- See you at the rumble.

1072
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:20,088
We're gonna kick some ass tonight.

1073
01:15:21,809 --> 01:15:24,050
So what did Mr Super
Soc have to say?

1074
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:26,560
He ain't a Soc.

1075
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:29,722
Just a guy that wanted
to talk, that's all.

1076
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:35,444
- Take care.
- See you later. Take it easy.

1077
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:36,724
Take it easy.

1078
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:42,360
Well, I wanna see this doctor.

1079
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:46,656
Nurse, Nurse, it's all
right. You can go in, boys.

1080
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:50,122
He's been asking for
you. It can't hurt.

1081
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:53,788
The doctor said you can
go in. There's the room.

1082
01:16:01,932 --> 01:16:03,968
- Hey, Johnny.
- Hey, you all.

1083
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:10,137
How are they treating you, kid?

1084
01:16:14,862 --> 01:16:19,731
Look, got your picture in the
paper here for... being a hero.

1085
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:21,319
Look at that.

1086
01:16:22,495 --> 01:16:24,736
Yeah, that's tough enough, huh?

1087
01:16:26,499 --> 01:16:28,410
Guess you can look at it later.

1088
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:34,040
Do you want anything?

1089
01:16:34,215 --> 01:16:36,046
A book, man.

1090
01:16:37,093 --> 01:16:39,175
Can you all get me another one?

1091
01:16:39,345 --> 01:16:41,677
I think he wants a copy
of "Gone with The Wind",

1092
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:44,213
so I can read it to him.

1093
01:16:44,391 --> 01:16:46,973
Would you mind going
downstairs and getting one?

1094
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:51,346
They got a gift shop
downstairs. I'll go get it.

1095
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:05,075
So...

1096
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:11,331
I guess Dal's gonna be ok.

1097
01:17:13,838 --> 01:17:16,420
Me and Darry, we're getting
along real good now.

1098
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:20,624
Johnny, are you ok?

1099
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:24,261
Oh, yeah. It just hurts sometimes.

1100
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:29,675
Usually, it don't, cos
I can't feel anything

1101
01:17:29,854 --> 01:17:31,560
below the middle of my back.

1102
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:34,517
Pretty bad off, ain't I, Ponyboy?

1103
01:17:34,692 --> 01:17:36,853
No. You're gonna
be all right, kid.

1104
01:17:38,696 --> 01:17:40,277
You got to be.

1105
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:43,196
Couldn't get along without you.

1106
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:46,575
- I won't be able to walk again.
- Huh?

1107
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:49,782
Not even on crutches. Doc
says I busted my back.

1108
01:17:50,957 --> 01:17:52,164
You're gonna be fine.

1109
01:17:54,962 --> 01:17:56,418
I know you are.

1110
01:17:57,381 --> 01:17:59,588
You wanna know something, Ponyboy?

1111
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:01,999
I used to talk about killing
myself all the time.

1112
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:04,419
Man, I don't wanna die now.

1113
01:18:04,597 --> 01:18:08,761
It ain't long enough. 16 years
ain't gonna be long enough.

1114
01:18:10,269 --> 01:18:12,100
Hell, I wouldn't
have minded so much,

1115
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:14,637
if there wasn't so much
stuff I ain't done yet.

1116
01:18:14,815 --> 01:18:17,807
So many, so many damn things
I ain't seen or nothing.

1117
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:23,312
That time we were up
in Windrixville...

1118
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:28,029
Was the only time I've ever been
away from our neighbourhood.

1119
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:32,746
Knock it off.

1120
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:36,909
If you get too juiced up, the doc
won't let us see you no more.

1121
01:18:41,926 --> 01:18:45,134
Johnny, your mother's
here to see you.

1122
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:47,386
I don't wanna see her.

1123
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:49,638
It's your mother. She's
here to see you.

1124
01:18:49,808 --> 01:18:51,389
I said I don't wanna see her.

1125
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:54,973
She probably just wants to tell
me how much trouble I'm causing.

1126
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:56,978
Why don't you tell her
to leave me al...

1127
01:18:59,777 --> 01:19:02,484
- What's the matter?
- You can't see him now.

1128
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:05,317
- Pony, is he ok?
- I don't know.

1129
01:19:05,491 --> 01:19:06,697
He's all right.

1130
01:19:06,867 --> 01:19:08,998
Make sure he gets this, all right?

1131
01:19:08,999 --> 01:19:09,999
Ok.

1132
01:19:13,415 --> 01:19:15,906
I've got a right to
see him. He's my son.

1133
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:19,147
He'd rather see
these no-good punks

1134
01:19:19,148 --> 01:19:21,212
than his own mother. You scum.

1135
01:19:21,382 --> 01:19:22,792
No wonder he hates your guts.

1136
01:19:22,967 --> 01:19:26,551
You don't even care about
him, you damn drunk.

1137
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:29,211
You go straight to hell.
You go right to hell.

1138
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:32,006
- You just...
- Come on.

1139
01:19:36,814 --> 01:19:39,430
- What's happened to your gown?
- I threw it away.

1140
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:43,021
Get out. Just get out. You
make my stomach sick.

1141
01:19:45,572 --> 01:19:48,109
- How are you doing?
- How are you doing, man?

1142
01:19:48,284 --> 01:19:50,650
Swiped you a gift, man.

1143
01:19:50,828 --> 01:19:54,412
It's good to see you guys, man.
This place gives me the creeps.

1144
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:55,741
I want out.

1145
01:19:57,501 --> 01:19:59,583
Tim Shepard dropped by.

1146
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:03,537
Saw my picture in the paper
and couldn't believe

1147
01:20:03,716 --> 01:20:07,459
it didn't have "wanted dead or
alive" written underneath it.

1148
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:10,218
He started rubbing it in
about the rumble, man.

1149
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:12,676
I hate missing it.

1150
01:20:15,102 --> 01:20:16,592
You got a cigarette, Pone?

1151
01:20:17,938 --> 01:20:19,394
Thanks.

1152
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:29,230
How is he? How's
Johnny doing, man?

1153
01:20:29,867 --> 01:20:32,449
Look, Dal, I don't know
about stuff like this,

1154
01:20:32,619 --> 01:20:36,783
but... but he didn't
look too good.

1155
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:40,749
He passed out cold before we left.

1156
01:20:52,014 --> 01:20:53,970
You still got that knife on you?

1157
01:20:54,141 --> 01:20:56,598
- What?
- The knife.

1158
01:20:58,228 --> 01:20:59,764
Give me it, will you?

1159
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:07,601
Thank you.

1160
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:12,693
You know, we got to win
that fight tonight.

1161
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:17,532
We got to get even
with those Socs.

1162
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:26,082
Let's do it for Johnny, man.
We'll do it for Johnny.

1163
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:36,797
Are you ok, Pony?

1164
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:41,848
Well, you feel kinda hot.

1165
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:44,896
I'm ok.

1166
01:21:45,067 --> 01:21:47,524
Be a pal and don't tell
Darry, ok, Two-Bit?

1167
01:21:49,321 --> 01:21:51,687
I'll take a bunch of
aspirins when I get home.

1168
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:54,197
All right.

1169
01:21:54,368 --> 01:21:57,986
Darry will kill me if he finds out
you're sick, and you fight anyway.

1170
01:21:59,206 --> 01:22:01,697
Keep your trap shut, he
won't find nothing out.

1171
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:07,916
You know the only thing that keeps
Darry from being a Soc is us?

1172
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:10,497
Yeah, I know.

1173
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:12,833
Come on, man.

1174
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:18,384
Tonight... I don't
like it one bit.

1175
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:22,718
Something awful is gonna happen.

1176
01:22:37,619 --> 01:22:39,951
We're gonna stomp ass
on those Socs tonight.

1177
01:22:40,122 --> 01:22:43,114
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- Yeah.

1178
01:22:49,423 --> 01:22:53,257
- Tough little kids, huh?
- Yeah. Future Greasers.

1179
01:22:53,427 --> 01:22:55,167
Yeah.

1180
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:56,881
Ponyboy.

1181
01:22:57,890 --> 01:22:59,426
Hey, Two-Bit.

1182
01:23:04,521 --> 01:23:06,261
What's up with the big times?

1183
01:23:08,032 --> 01:23:09,063
No weapons.

1184
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:12,062
They play your way.
It's a fair deal.

1185
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:14,353
Are you sure about that?

1186
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:16,613
Well, Randy told me.
He knows for sure.

1187
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:20,363
Good deal. Thanks, Cherry.

1188
01:23:23,081 --> 01:23:24,537
Ponyboy, wait a minute.

1189
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:26,414
Come here. I wanna talk to you.

1190
01:23:30,214 --> 01:23:31,704
How's Johnny doing?

1191
01:23:31,882 --> 01:23:35,374
Not so good. Would you
come up and see him?

1192
01:23:36,303 --> 01:23:38,760
- No, I couldn't.
- Why not?

1193
01:23:39,515 --> 01:23:40,971
I couldn't.

1194
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:45,805
He killed Bob.

1195
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:49,684
Maybe Bob asked for it.

1196
01:23:50,609 --> 01:23:52,099
I know he did.

1197
01:23:53,737 --> 01:23:57,571
But you didn't know his other
side. He could be real sweet.

1198
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:01,608
He wasn't just any boy.

1199
01:24:02,287 --> 01:24:05,199
Bob had something that
made him different.

1200
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:07,905
Made people follow
him. Maybe better

1201
01:24:07,906 --> 01:24:09,992
than the crowd. You
know what I mean?

1202
01:24:10,796 --> 01:24:12,707
That's ok. I don't want
you to go see him.

1203
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:14,712
We don't need your damn charity.

1204
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:18,125
Ponyboy.

1205
01:24:19,346 --> 01:24:21,712
I wasn't trying to
give you charity.

1206
01:24:25,978 --> 01:24:27,684
I only wanted to help.

1207
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,434
I liked you from the start.

1208
01:24:31,608 --> 01:24:33,314
The way we talked.

1209
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:37,652
Wouldn't you try to help me
if you thought you could?

1210
01:24:40,534 --> 01:24:43,321
Can you see the sunset from
the southside very good?

1211
01:24:43,996 --> 01:24:45,611
Yeah, real good.

1212
01:24:46,873 --> 01:24:49,159
You can see it from
the northside, too.

1213
01:24:50,836 --> 01:24:54,420
Thanks, Ponyboy. You dig ok.

1214
01:24:55,632 --> 01:24:57,293
See you around.

1215
01:25:11,732 --> 01:25:14,250
Soda, when did you start shaving?

1216
01:25:14,251 --> 01:25:15,441
When I was 15.

1217
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:21,025
- When did, when did Darry?
- When he was 13.

1218
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:24,532
Why? Figuring on growing
a beard for the rumble?

1219
01:25:24,703 --> 01:25:26,239
Oh, you're funny.

1220
01:25:26,413 --> 01:25:28,779
Maybe I'll send you into
the Reader's Digest.

1221
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:31,039
They pay a lot of money
for funny things.

1222
01:25:31,209 --> 01:25:33,370
- Let's go, then.
- Forget it.

1223
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:36,412
- Come on. Come on, Soda.
- You like fights, huh, Soda?

1224
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:39,582
- Yeah, I like fights, man.
- You like fights, huh?

1225
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,671
- How come?
- It's a contest.

1226
01:25:41,845 --> 01:25:43,836
It's like a drag race,
or a dance or something.

1227
01:25:44,014 --> 01:25:46,881
We're gonna beat them
Socs' heads in, ain't we?

1228
01:25:47,059 --> 01:25:49,721
When I get into a fight, I
wanna stomp. I like it, too.

1229
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:55,180
Why do you like fights, Darry?

1230
01:25:55,359 --> 01:25:57,566
He likes to show off his muscles.

1231
01:25:57,736 --> 01:26:00,978
Hey, I'm gonna show them off on
you, if you get any mouthier.

1232
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:05,865
Hey, Pony...

1233
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:09,611
I don't know if you ought
to be in this rumble.

1234
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:12,748
How come? I've always come
through before, ain't I?

1235
01:26:14,211 --> 01:26:17,169
Yeah, but, you know, you was
in shape before, and...

1236
01:26:18,382 --> 01:26:20,195
You know, you ain't
looking so good.

1237
01:26:20,196 --> 01:26:21,715
You're tensed up all the time.

1238
01:26:21,885 --> 01:26:25,719
Let him fight, man. Everyone's
tensed up before a rumble.

1239
01:26:25,889 --> 01:26:28,801
It's skin against skin. He
ain't gonna get hurt, is he?

1240
01:26:30,477 --> 01:26:33,014
Come on. I'll grab
hold of little one.

1241
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:36,396
We will need every man we can
get, but... I don't know.

1242
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:39,433
If it was with knives or
chains, it'd be different.

1243
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:42,151
I'll be ok.

1244
01:26:42,698 --> 01:26:45,686
All right, but you be careful, ok?

1245
01:26:45,687 --> 01:26:46,737
I will be.

1246
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:49,151
How come you never worry
about him so much?

1247
01:26:49,329 --> 01:26:52,617
Man, that's one kid brother
I ain't got to worry about.

1248
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:54,687
This kid can use
his head. At least

1249
01:26:54,688 --> 01:26:56,375
for one thing, to grow hair on.

1250
01:26:56,545 --> 01:26:57,955
Get out.

1251
01:27:08,432 --> 01:27:13,426
All right. Yeah. Go, go, go.

1252
01:27:14,813 --> 01:27:17,429
Come on, come on, come
on. What do you think?

1253
01:27:20,485 --> 01:27:22,067
Come on. Come on.

1254
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:25,900
You and Ponyboy, if the fuzz
show, beat it out of there.

1255
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:28,816
We'll get jailed, but you two
will get the boys' home.

1256
01:27:28,994 --> 01:27:30,404
Know what I'm saying?

1257
01:27:30,579 --> 01:27:33,616
Ain't nobody gonna call the
fuzz in this neighbourhood.

1258
01:27:33,790 --> 01:27:35,246
Hey.

1259
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:38,454
All the same, you two beat it
out of there. Do you hear me?

1260
01:27:38,628 --> 01:27:39,993
Yeah, bro.

1261
01:27:55,687 --> 01:27:57,097
How are you doing, Tim?

1262
01:27:57,981 --> 01:27:59,437
Pretty good.

1263
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:05,231
You and the quiet kid were the
ones who killed the Soc, right?

1264
01:28:05,405 --> 01:28:08,738
- Yeah.
- Good going, kid.

1265
01:28:08,909 --> 01:28:11,116
Curly always said you
were a good kid.

1266
01:28:12,496 --> 01:28:15,363
Curly's in the reformatory
for the next six months.

1267
01:29:33,785 --> 01:29:37,027
The odds are as even as we can
get. You stay close to me, kid.

1268
01:29:57,392 --> 01:30:00,384
Hello, Darrel. Long time no see.

1269
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:02,222
Hello, Paul.

1270
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:03,762
What's up?

1271
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:06,477
They used to buddy around
together, play football.

1272
01:30:06,985 --> 01:30:08,270
I'll take you.

1273
01:30:08,445 --> 01:30:11,152
You know, a rumble ain't
a rumble without me.

1274
01:31:22,936 --> 01:31:24,426
Ponyboy.

1275
01:31:43,623 --> 01:31:44,908
Ponyboy.

1276
01:31:57,846 --> 01:32:00,007
What are you guys doing?

1277
01:32:00,807 --> 01:32:02,923
Let's get out of here.

1278
01:32:11,151 --> 01:32:13,267
Ponyboy, are you ok?

1279
01:32:31,629 --> 01:32:34,041
Are you ok? Come on.

1280
01:32:37,751 --> 01:32:38,751
Yeah.

1281
01:33:02,744 --> 01:33:04,683
Wait. Act sick. I'll pretend

1282
01:33:04,684 --> 01:33:06,987
like I'm taking you
to the hospital.

1283
01:33:08,249 --> 01:33:11,332
You've got to have a good
reason for driving like that.

1284
01:33:11,503 --> 01:33:14,870
The kid fell off his motorcycle.
I'm taking him to the hospital.

1285
01:33:22,514 --> 01:33:25,096
- How bad is he?
- I don't know, man.

1286
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:27,973
Do I look like a doctor?
He looks pretty bad to me.

1287
01:33:28,144 --> 01:33:29,805
- Follow me.
- All right.

1288
01:33:32,273 --> 01:33:34,059
Sucker.

1289
01:33:51,376 --> 01:33:52,912
Man.

1290
01:33:59,759 --> 01:34:01,499
I was crazy. You know that, kid?

1291
01:34:01,678 --> 01:34:04,966
I was crazy about wanting Johnny
to stay out of trouble, man.

1292
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:08,132
If he was smart like me, he
wouldn't have been in this mess.

1293
01:34:08,309 --> 01:34:11,472
If he was smart like me, he
wouldn't have ran in that church.

1294
01:34:13,356 --> 01:34:17,725
You better wise up, Pony, man.
You just better wise up, man.

1295
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:20,314
You get tough like me,
and you don't get hurt.

1296
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:26,449
Watch out for yourself, and
nothing can touch you, man.

1297
01:34:41,259 --> 01:34:42,795
Hey.

1298
01:34:42,969 --> 01:34:44,550
Hey, Johnny.

1299
01:34:45,305 --> 01:34:46,715
We beat the Socs, man.

1300
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:49,597
We chased them right out
of our neighbourhood.

1301
01:34:49,767 --> 01:34:52,679
- Go on.
- It's useless.

1302
01:34:53,563 --> 01:34:56,930
- Huh?
- Fighting ain't no good.

1303
01:35:00,028 --> 01:35:01,811
You know, they're still writing

1304
01:35:01,812 --> 01:35:03,941
editorials about
you in the papers,

1305
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:05,571
about you being a hero.

1306
01:35:06,993 --> 01:35:10,110
We're all proud of you, buddy.
It's gonna be all right.

1307
01:35:10,663 --> 01:35:12,528
Ponyboy...

1308
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:15,915
Ponyboy...

1309
01:35:20,298 --> 01:35:22,004
S...

1310
01:35:22,175 --> 01:35:25,383
Stay gold, Ponyboy.

1311
01:35:26,679 --> 01:35:28,544
Stay gold.

1312
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:41,687
Johnny, come on.

1313
01:35:46,366 --> 01:35:48,106
So, this is what you get, huh?

1314
01:35:48,284 --> 01:35:50,491
This is what you get
for helping people?

1315
01:35:52,830 --> 01:35:54,411
You punk.

1316
01:35:55,291 --> 01:35:57,407
Come on, Johnny. Don't die.

1317
01:35:59,128 --> 01:36:00,584
Come on.

1318
01:36:01,839 --> 01:36:04,581
Come on, Johnny.
Don't die on me now.

1319
01:36:06,052 --> 01:36:07,588
Please.

1320
01:36:14,227 --> 01:36:15,717
Bastards.

1321
01:36:47,135 --> 01:36:49,091
Hey, you, you're not allowed here.

1322
01:36:52,557 --> 01:36:54,673
I'm allowed anywhere I want.

1323
01:36:58,021 --> 01:36:59,431
You're out of your mind.

1324
01:36:59,605 --> 01:37:03,644
Why do you bother helping
people? It doesn't do any good.

1325
01:37:06,946 --> 01:37:11,155
Well, it makes me look
kinda... kinda tough.

1326
01:37:11,326 --> 01:37:14,443
What do you think, Soda? Do you
think it makes me look tough?

1327
01:37:16,247 --> 01:37:18,954
I think it makes you
look different.

1328
01:37:19,125 --> 01:37:21,241
That guy had sharp teeth.

1329
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:24,035
What do you mean by "different"?

1330
01:37:24,213 --> 01:37:26,169
You got a hole in your mouth.

1331
01:37:30,678 --> 01:37:32,714
Hey, where you been?

1332
01:37:38,644 --> 01:37:42,182
Hey, Pony, what? What's wrong?

1333
01:37:44,984 --> 01:37:46,599
Johnny's dead.

1334
01:37:53,576 --> 01:37:55,487
I told him about beating the Socs.

1335
01:37:56,496 --> 01:38:00,239
I don't know... He just died.
Told me to "stay gold."

1336
01:38:02,085 --> 01:38:03,541
Hey, Pony.

1337
01:38:03,711 --> 01:38:05,497
Dally's gone.

1338
01:38:07,173 --> 01:38:09,164
He couldn't take it.
He's gonna blow.

1339
01:38:34,325 --> 01:38:36,281
Do you wanna buy
one of those, son?

1340
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:46,117
You tear those up, you have to
pay for them. Don't do that.

1341
01:38:54,011 --> 01:38:56,127
You know, you got to
pay for that magazine.

1342
01:39:00,893 --> 01:39:02,633
Oh, God. Don't shoot.

1343
01:39:03,771 --> 01:39:06,558
Give me the money.
Give me the money.

1344
01:39:06,732 --> 01:39:08,347
I'm so sick of you punks.

1345
01:39:08,526 --> 01:39:10,357
Take it and get out of here.

1346
01:39:38,139 --> 01:39:40,346
- Yeah?
- Hello, Darrel?

1347
01:39:40,516 --> 01:39:41,926
No, it's Steve. Dally?

1348
01:39:42,101 --> 01:39:45,013
- Steve, I want to talk to Darry.
- Yeah, sure.

1349
01:39:46,564 --> 01:39:49,351
- Hello?
- All right, Darry, listen.

1350
01:39:49,525 --> 01:39:50,605
Yeah?

1351
01:39:50,776 --> 01:39:54,143
I robbed a store. The
cops are looking for me.

1352
01:39:54,322 --> 01:39:55,590
Can you meet me in the park?

1353
01:39:55,591 --> 01:39:57,155
Sure, Dal. Are you all right?

1354
01:39:57,325 --> 01:39:59,190
- Yeah. Johnny's dead.
- We know.

1355
01:39:59,368 --> 01:40:00,824
Johnny.

1356
01:40:00,995 --> 01:40:02,498
Meet me in the park, will you?

1357
01:40:02,499 --> 01:40:04,237
Hang on. We'll be right there.

1358
01:40:07,210 --> 01:40:09,701
That was Dally. The cops are
after him. We got to hide him.

1359
01:40:27,522 --> 01:40:29,934
- You're never gonna get me alive.
- Drop it.

1360
01:40:31,150 --> 01:40:34,313
- It's not loaded. Don't.
- Stop.

1361
01:40:34,487 --> 01:40:35,897
It's not loaded.

1362
01:40:38,074 --> 01:40:39,439
No. No.

1363
01:40:39,617 --> 01:40:41,528
He's just a kid.

1364
01:40:47,708 --> 01:40:50,165
- No.
- Pony?

1365
01:40:54,966 --> 01:40:57,799
You stupid idiot.

1366
01:40:57,969 --> 01:41:00,005
You stupid freak.

1367
01:41:00,179 --> 01:41:03,012
Johnny and Dallas both...

1368
01:41:08,104 --> 01:41:11,221
- Soda?
- Yeah?

1369
01:41:11,399 --> 01:41:15,142
- Is somebody sick?
- Yeah, somebody's sick.

1370
01:41:17,363 --> 01:41:18,694
Quiet.

1371
01:41:19,448 --> 01:41:22,315
He tried to drown me.

1372
01:41:23,869 --> 01:41:25,530
I could have made it simpler.

1373
01:41:25,705 --> 01:41:28,162
For the fight not to have
happened in the first place.

1374
01:41:28,332 --> 01:41:32,120
Sure. Your name is Sherry?
But your nickname is Cherry?

1375
01:41:32,295 --> 01:41:33,535
Yes.

1376
01:41:33,713 --> 01:41:35,749
You know, to teach
them a lesson.

1377
01:41:35,923 --> 01:41:40,587
Yes, there was an argument
because my boyfriend showed up,

1378
01:41:40,761 --> 01:41:45,004
and... well, he was upset that
we were with the other boys.

1379
01:41:45,182 --> 01:41:47,047
They chased us and caught us.

1380
01:41:47,935 --> 01:41:49,721
It was Bob and I.

1381
01:41:49,895 --> 01:41:52,637
They threw me in the fountain
and tried to drown me.

1382
01:41:52,815 --> 01:41:55,648
- Just to go looking for them.
- Gonna beat up Johnny Cade.

1383
01:41:55,818 --> 01:41:57,399
You know, teach them a lesson.

1384
01:41:57,570 --> 01:41:58,776
I could have made it simpler

1385
01:41:58,946 --> 01:42:01,608
for the fight not to have
happened in the first place.

1386
01:42:04,535 --> 01:42:06,150
I could have made it simpler.

1387
01:42:06,329 --> 01:42:08,911
For the fight not to have
happened in the first place.

1388
01:42:18,341 --> 01:42:20,252
Defendant not guilty.

1389
01:42:20,426 --> 01:42:22,592
At this time, I will
place him in the

1390
01:42:22,593 --> 01:42:24,760
custody of his older
brother, Darrel.

1391
01:42:24,930 --> 01:42:26,511
This court is adjourned.

1392
01:43:19,652 --> 01:43:21,313
Hey, Ponyboy?

1393
01:43:22,571 --> 01:43:24,061
Oh, hi, Mr Simms.

1394
01:43:24,240 --> 01:43:26,322
I got to talk to you
about your grade.

1395
01:43:26,492 --> 01:43:28,357
Yeah, I know I'm doing lousy.

1396
01:43:28,536 --> 01:43:30,151
Frankly, you're flunking.

1397
01:43:30,329 --> 01:43:32,306
But, I'll tell you
what, taking into

1398
01:43:32,307 --> 01:43:34,072
consideration the circumstances,

1399
01:43:34,250 --> 01:43:36,582
you come up with a
good semester theme,

1400
01:43:36,752 --> 01:43:38,242
I'll pass you with a C.

1401
01:43:39,547 --> 01:43:41,708
Should it be some kind
of research paper?

1402
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:44,211
Personal experience will do it.

1403
01:43:46,887 --> 01:43:50,300
Great. My first trip to the zoo.

1404
01:43:59,817 --> 01:44:03,105
With your brains and grades, man,
you could get a scholarship.

1405
01:44:03,279 --> 01:44:06,237
And we could put you through
college. Isn't that right, Soda?

1406
01:44:08,033 --> 01:44:11,275
You live in a vacuum, Pony, and
you're gonna have to cut it out.

1407
01:44:11,454 --> 01:44:13,786
There's no stop living,
cos you lose somebody.

1408
01:44:13,956 --> 01:44:15,446
I thought you knew that.

1409
01:44:17,543 --> 01:44:19,514
You don't like the way I'm running

1410
01:44:19,515 --> 01:44:21,661
things, you can get
out, all right?

1411
01:44:21,839 --> 01:44:25,331
You'd like me to just get out. But
it's not that easy, is it, Soda?

1412
01:44:25,509 --> 01:44:27,750
Goddamn, you guys.
Leave me out of it.

1413
01:44:27,928 --> 01:44:29,418
What's wrong with you?

1414
01:44:41,901 --> 01:44:44,108
Run on. I'll be right behind you.

1415
01:44:44,278 --> 01:44:45,688
Ok.

1416
01:44:53,037 --> 01:44:54,447
Goddamn it, Ponyboy.

1417
01:44:54,622 --> 01:44:57,955
You should have gone out for
football instead of track.

1418
01:44:58,125 --> 01:45:00,832
- Where you think you're going?
- I don't know, man.

1419
01:45:05,049 --> 01:45:07,165
Just, like, sometimes
I have to get out.

1420
01:45:09,386 --> 01:45:13,595
It's like I'm a middleman in a
tug-of-war between you guys.

1421
01:45:16,602 --> 01:45:18,718
I don't know. I can't take sides.

1422
01:45:26,153 --> 01:45:27,643
Ponyboy...

1423
01:45:28,823 --> 01:45:31,155
Darry could have put
you in a boys' home.

1424
01:45:31,325 --> 01:45:33,407
Worked his way through college.

1425
01:45:36,163 --> 01:45:37,699
I'm telling you true, Pony.

1426
01:45:40,125 --> 01:45:42,662
You don't wanna be
like me, anyway.

1427
01:45:42,837 --> 01:45:45,544
Cos I'm happy working
in a gas station.

1428
01:45:47,925 --> 01:45:50,462
You'd never be happy doing
something like that.

1429
01:45:53,013 --> 01:45:54,469
Darry...

1430
01:45:55,432 --> 01:45:57,537
You guys stop yelling
at him for every

1431
01:45:57,538 --> 01:45:59,266
little thing that he does, man.

1432
01:46:00,396 --> 01:46:03,308
He feels things
different than you.

1433
01:46:04,525 --> 01:46:07,642
It's bad enough having
to listen to you.

1434
01:46:11,615 --> 01:46:14,482
But when you start trying
to get me to take sides...

1435
01:46:15,494 --> 01:46:17,860
We're all we got left now.

1436
01:46:20,833 --> 01:46:26,078
If we don't have each other...
you end up like Dallas.

1437
01:46:27,256 --> 01:46:30,248
And I don't mean dead either.
I mean, how he was before.

1438
01:46:33,762 --> 01:46:35,878
So, please.

1439
01:46:36,557 --> 01:46:38,388
Don't fight any more.

1440
01:46:38,559 --> 01:46:40,015
Please.

1441
01:46:41,061 --> 01:46:45,395
Sure. Sure, little buddy. We
ain't gonna fight no more.

1442
01:46:52,781 --> 01:46:54,442
Ponyboy...

1443
01:46:55,159 --> 01:46:56,444
Pone.

1444
01:47:00,915 --> 01:47:03,372
Now, don't you start
bawling, too, Pony.

1445
01:47:03,542 --> 01:47:05,749
One bawling baby in
this family is enough.

1446
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:07,376
I ain't crying.

1447
01:47:09,715 --> 01:47:12,172
Let's go home. I'm cold.

1448
01:48:05,771 --> 01:48:08,808
Ponyboy, I asked the nurse
to give you this book,

1449
01:48:08,983 --> 01:48:11,269
so you could finish it.

1450
01:48:11,443 --> 01:48:13,406
It was worth saving
those kids. Their

1451
01:48:13,407 --> 01:48:15,061
lives are worth more than mine.

1452
01:48:15,239 --> 01:48:17,651
They have more to live for.

1453
01:48:17,825 --> 01:48:19,816
Tell Dally I think it's worth it.

1454
01:48:21,662 --> 01:48:23,072
I'm gonna miss you guys.

1455
01:48:23,247 --> 01:48:27,786
I've been thinking about it, and
that poem, that guy that wrote it.

1456
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:33,171
He meant you're gold when
you're a kid. Like green.

1457
01:48:33,340 --> 01:48:35,376
When you're a kid
everything's new.

1458
01:48:36,343 --> 01:48:37,799
Dawn.

1459
01:48:38,512 --> 01:48:41,629
Like the way you dig
sunsets, Pony. That's gold.

1460
01:48:42,516 --> 01:48:45,178
Keep it that way. It's
a good way to be.

1461
01:48:46,770 --> 01:48:48,635
I want you to ask
Dally to look at one.

1462
01:48:48,814 --> 01:48:51,021
I don't think he's
ever seen a sunset.

1463
01:48:52,609 --> 01:48:55,066
There's still lots of
good in the world.

1464
01:48:56,363 --> 01:48:58,570
Tell Dally. I don't
think he knows.

1465
01:49:00,159 --> 01:49:02,195
