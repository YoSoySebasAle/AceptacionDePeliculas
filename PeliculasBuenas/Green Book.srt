Joe, it's gonna turn up. I swear
to God it's gonna turn up.

68

00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,251
I don't get my hat, I'll
burn the Copa down.

00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,096
I'm gonna have to go back
to driving garbage trucks.

Jesus Christ.

73
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,017
Loscudo's out of his mind.

74
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,770
We earned our money tonight.

75
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:40,006
Lip, I thought you were
gonna kill that guy.

76
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,113
- Yeah.
- Better him than me.

77
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,127
So, what are you gonna
do while we're closed?

78
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,951
I don't know. Maybe go work
at my uncle's pizza joint.

79
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,665
You?

80
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:53,992
I'm gonna drink for two months.

81
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:01,750
Take me home, Lip.

82
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,709
- Hey, good luck.
- You, too.

83
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:04,840
See you, Carmine.

84
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,532
No, you shouldn't...
That should not happen.

85
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,637
No, I don't want to be a...

86
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:10,643
My hat.

87
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:15,062
Heard it was missing,
so I looked into it.

88
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,393
I wanted to kill that broad.

89
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,225
No, no. It wasn't her fault.

90
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,652
Who had the balls
to clip Gio's hat?

91
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,755
Don't worry about it.
I took care of it.

92
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,486
Yeah, I hope you gave
him some beating.

93
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,660
Here. Take this. Put
it in your kick.

94
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:33,581
No. No, thanks. It was a
pleasure, Mr Loscudo, really.

95
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,283
Bullshit. Take it.

96
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,162
And from now on, you don't
call me "Mr Loscudo."

97
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,256
You hear me?

98
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:41,505
I'm your pal Gio.

99
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,253
Morning.

100
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,840
Good night.

101
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:13,034
One down, and the batter
will be Roger Maris.

102
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,328
- We need to get back in this.
- The pitch to Maris. Curveball.

103
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,309
Come on, Roger. Come on.

104
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:20,020
Come on, Roger, hit one out.

105
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,250
- Let's do it.
- Johnny, quiet.

106
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,793
- You're gonna jinx it.
- Come on, Roger.

107
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:25,184
Hey, Johnny. Think you could
yell a little louder?

108
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,611
- Maris is up.
- Yeah, so am I now.

109
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,758
What the hell are all
you guys doing here?

110
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,759
All right.

111
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,367
We came over to keep
Dolores company.

112
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,364
- Come on.
- Tony.

113
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,138
Thank you, madam.

114
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,520
- Come on, Roger, please.
- Let's do it, baby.

115
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,644
- I'll walk you out.
- Sure.

116
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,643
We need to get back
in this ball game.

117
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,005
- Come on.
- Thank you so much.

118
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,190
Any problems, give us a call.

119
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,067
Come on, come on, Roger.

120
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,259
- The 1-2 pitch.
- Come on, baby.

121
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,803
The curve is hit deep
into right field.

122
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:21,999
We did it. We got it.

123
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,246
- Yeah.
- There it is.

124
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,372
Whoo.

125
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,294
- All right.
- 3-1, baby. 3-1.

126
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,919
- Coming back.
- Roger, baby, way to go.

127
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,295
- 3-1.
- Way to go.

128
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,590
Do it again. Let's do it again.

129
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,680
Come on, baby.

130
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,761
No, Tony. Go get dressed.
We're gonna eat.

131
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,805
All right.

132
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,103
No game seven, no game seven.

133
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:56,651
From thy bounty, through
Christ our Lord.

134
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,657
- Amen.
- Amen.

135
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,914
And if anyone hears of a
job for Tony, let us know.

136
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:04,788
- Dolour.
- What?

137
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:05,878
Please.

138
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,044
What happened? Did you get fired?

139
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:09,588
- No.
- No.

140
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,006
The Copa's closing for repairs,

141
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,778
so he just needs something
for a couple of months.

142
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,970
All the people he knows, he'll
find something in no time.

143
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,973
Well, he had a great job at
the sanitation department.

144
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,414
You shouldn't have
punched out the foreman.

145
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:31,487
He shouldn't have woke me up.

146
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,439
That's Tony.

147
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,553
I can't believe they lost.

148
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,068
- Don't worry, don't worry.
- Relax.

149
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,785
That never happened before.

150
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,556
They're gonna win
the World Series.

151
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,715
I'm telling you,
this is gonna be the

152
00:09:56,716 --> 00:09:58,463
easiest 50 bucks you're
ever gonna make.

153
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,717
Yeah, we'll see.

154
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,383
Hey, there they are.

155
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,477
Hi, Johnny.

156
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,498
- Tony, how are you?
- Hey, Paulie. How you doing?

157
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:08,060
I'm good, I'm good. So,
Johnny here tells me

158
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,108
you ate 48 White Castle
burgers all in one sitting.

159
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,980
Cheeseburgers.

160
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,357
You tell him, Frankie.

161
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,447
I don't believe it.

162
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,648
What do we care if you believe it?

163
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,198
Hey, Gorman. What's the
record here for hot dogs?

164
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,244
Eighteen. Fat Paulie.

165
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,101
Why wasn't Lip in on that contest?

166
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,037
What contest? I was hungry.

167
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,834
Well, the bet's simple.

168
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,379
Half a C-note. Most hot
dogs in an hour wins.

169
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,956
With toppings.

170
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,885
- What the hell you weigh?
- 260.

171
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,054
Hey, 2... Your left
ass weighs 260.

172
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,678
May my mother-in-law drop dead
on the spot if I'm lying.

173
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,728
- All right. You're on.
- Good.

174
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:54,235
Pick it up, Lip. The baby
elephant just hit 19.

175
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,232
Let's go, Lip. Let's go.

176
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,405
Come on, let's go, Lip.
Let's get this going.

177
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,448
You're embarrassing.

178
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:02,638
You're embarrassing your son.

179
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,574
He is killing you.

180
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,004
Hey, Nicky, you doing
your homework?

181
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,422
- Yep.
- Good.

182
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:18,552
Where you been?

183
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,470
Gorman's.

184
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:21,847
I'm making dinner.

185
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,927
Fat Paulie bet me 50 bucks he
could eat more hot dogs than me.

186
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:31,097
He knocked off 24.
Guy's an animal.

187
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,104
Are you crazy? You lost $50?

188
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,106
Dolores, please.

189
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,609
I ate 26.

190
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,199
You are so lucky.

191
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,447
You know that?

192
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,952
Rent is due on Monday.

193
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,539
You gonna get that?

194
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,130
- Yeah?
- Hey, Lip.

195
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,760
Some guy called over here, a
doctor. He's looking for a driver.

196
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,799
- You interested?
- Yeah.

197
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:09,385
They're interviewing
guys tomorrow afternoon.

198
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:14,940
The address is, 881
Seventh Avenue.

199
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,026
2:15.

200
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,331
Hey. Excuse me.

201
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,424
We're not open right now,

202
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:41,904
but you're welcome to purchase
tickets to tonight's performance.

203
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:45,512
Nah, that's all right. I think
I got the wrong address.

204
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,181
But, is there a doctor's
office in here?

205
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,850
A doctor's office?

206
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,389
Dr Shirley?

207
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,123
You have the correct address.

208
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,104
Dr Shirley lives upstairs,
above the hall.

209
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,572
How you doing?

210
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,375
I'm here for the driver job.

211
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,629
Tony Lip.

212
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:20,915
No "Tony Lip."

213
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,467
No, I should be on there.

214
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,472
No.

215
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,591
I have a Tony Val...
Valle-la-la...

216
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,642
Vallelonga. Yeah. That's me.

217
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,893
- Fill it out while you wait.
- What?

218
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,562
Fill it out while you wait.

219
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,984
Oh. Yeah.

220
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,218
Have a seat.

221
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:36,077
Mr Vallelonga. Sorry
to keep you waiting.

222
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:37,376
Oh.

223
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,627
I'm Dr Donald Shirley.

224
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,422
Tony.

225
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,251
Yes. Please sit down.

226
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,220
Some place you got here.

227
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,551
Are them horns real?

228
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,724
Elephant tusks, yes.

229
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,604
What about that?

230
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,305
Is that a molar?

231
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,481
- A what?
- A molar, like a shark tooth.

232
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,858
Or a tiger's maybe.

233
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,651
It was a gift.

234
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:12,238
I thought... I thought I
was going to an office.

235
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:15,074
They said a doctor
needed a driver.

236
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:16,906
That's all they told you?

237
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,331
Yeah.

238
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,410
Actually, it's a bit more
complicated than that.

239
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,454
Have you ever driven
professionally before?

240
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,215
Yeah. Sanitation.

241
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,051
Garbage trucks.

242
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,838
Plus, I drive my
boss home at night.

243
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,641
But I can drive anything.
Limos. Tow trucks.

244
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,468
Snowplows. Whatever.

245
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:40,600
I see. What other
experience do you have?

246
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,022
I worked a lot of joints.

247
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,350
Waggon Wheel, Peppermint
Lounge, Copa.

248
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,936
- In what capacity?
- What do you mean?

249
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,233
What did you do there?

250
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,651
Public relations.

251
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,913
Well, first of all, Tony,
I'm not a medical doctor.

252
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:58,999
I'm a musician.

253
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,412
You mean, like, songs?

254
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,336
Yes. And I'm about to
embark on a concert tour,

255
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,209
the majority of which
will be down south.

256
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,586
- Atlantic City.
- No.

257
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,338
The Deep South.

258
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,164
First, we're starting
in the Midwest,

259
00:16:12,165 --> 00:16:13,762
and then we're taking a hard left.

260
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,947
Kentucky, North
Carolina, Tennessee,

261
00:16:15,948 --> 00:16:17,425
and on down through the Delta.

262
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,511
Do you foresee any issues
in working for a black man?

263
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,647
No.

264
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,562
No, no, no. It was
just the other day,

265
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,190
me and the wife had a couple of
coloured guys over at the house.

266
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,067
For... For drinks.

267
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,238
I see. You're married.

268
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,615
Yeah. Two kids.

269
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,199
I'm not sure this is the
proper job for a married man.

270
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,955
Why? Are we bringing broads?

271
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:48,171
My point is we'll be gone
for eight straight weeks.

272
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,964
No breaks, right up
until Christmas.

273
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:53,166
You're quite sure you can leave
your family for that long?

274
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:54,928
Depends what you're paying.

275
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,051
A hundred dollars a week
plus room and board.

276
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,508
But let me be crystal clear.

277
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:02,303
I'm not just hiring a chauffeur.

278
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,351
I need someone who can
handle my itinerary,

279
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,682
be a personal assistant.

280
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:07,857
I need a valet.

281
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,983
I need someone who can launder
my clothes and shine my shoes.

282
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:15,406
Good luck, Doc.

283
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:19,955
Tony.

284
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,121
I had my record label ask around
town to find me the right man.

285
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,877
Your name came up more than once.

286
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,593
You've impressed several
people with your...

287
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,629
innate ability to handle trouble.

288
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,971
And that is why I called and
inquired about your availability.

289
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,564
Okay, here's the deal. I got no

290
00:17:47,565 --> 00:17:49,354
problem being on
the road with you.

291
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,479
But I ain't no butler.

292
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,778
I ain't ironing no shirts, and I'm
not polishing nobody's shoes.

293
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,026
You need somebody to get you
from point A to point B?

294
00:17:56,101 --> 00:17:58,201
You need someone to make sure
there's no problems along the way?

295
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,121
And believe me, you in the Deep

296
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:02,412
South... there's
gonna be problems.

297
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,995
So, if you want me, it's a
buck and a quarter a week.

298
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,205
Or go hire that little chink
just pranced out of here,

299
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,377
see how far you get.

300
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,090
Well, Mr Vallelonga...

301
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,294
thank you for stopping by.

302
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,526
Hey, Bobby.

303
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:33,519
Give me a Rheingold.

304
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,155
Ice cold.

305
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,790
Mr Tony.

306
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,913
Augie asking about you.

307
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,517
Come on. I'm dying
of thirst over here.

308
00:18:52,518 --> 00:18:53,518
Shut up.

309
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,630
I'm talking.

310
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,471
When?

311
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,464
Now. He in his box.

312
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:29,376
Tony Lip.

313
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,331
What the hell
happened at the Copa?

314
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,917
I hear you almost split
a guy's face open.

315
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:38,466
That guy you hit, Mikey Cerrone,

316
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,510
part of Charlie the Hand's crew.

317
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,508
Guess he should have known better.

318
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:52,014
Hand asked me to look into
it. I spoke to Podell.

319
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,768
Whole thing was, over a
piece of ass, right?

320
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:57,946
Yeah.

321
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,782
Beef like that should never
happen inside the club.

322
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,859
They were out of line.

323
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,661
So we squashed it.

324
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:11,454
You, looking to earn a
little extra scharole?

325
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,873
I can keep you busy
while the Copa is down.

326
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,047
What do I got to do?

327
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:18,883
Things.

328
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:26,553
Appreciate it, but, I want to
spend some time with the family.

329
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,059
Don't be stupid.

330
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,126
You make yourself a
few extra bucks,

331
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:33,476
you buy something nice for that
pretty little wife of yours.

332
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:41,443
Nah, I'm good. I'm
flush right now.

333
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:56,671
Here's 50.

334
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,839
Here. Pay me 60 by New
Year's, you get it back.

335
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,137
Hey, Lip.

336
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,762
Everything okay?

337
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,720
What, you got beak
trouble, Charlie?

338
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:11,934
Mind your business.

339
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,005
So, come on. I'm
dying to hear. What

340
00:21:18,006 --> 00:21:19,689
happened with the
doctor interview?

341
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,238
He ain't a real doctor.
He's a piano player.

342
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,862
Well, I don't understand. Why did
they say that he was a doctor?

343
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,402
I don't know. I
think he's, like, a

344
00:21:29,403 --> 00:21:31,284
doctor of piano
playing or something.

345
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,489
You can be that?

346
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,125
I guess.

347
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,284
He lives on top of Carnegie Hall.

348
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,370
You should've seen
this place, Dee.

349
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:41,172
It was filled with statues
and all kinds of fancy crap.

350
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,058
And he was sitting on top
of a frigging throne

351
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:46,211
all dressed up like... like the
king of the jungle bunnies.

352
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,097
He's coloured?

353
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,260
Well, you wouldn't
last a week with him.

354
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,020
For the right money, I would.

355
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:07,283
Yeah.

356
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:09,494
Oh.

357
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,036
Look...

358
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:13,832
Really?

359
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:15,908
- Okay.
- Everything okay?

360
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,242
Okay, hang on a sec.

361
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:21,334
It's, Dr Shirley, the piano guy.

362
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,664
He wants to talk to you.

363
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,757
- Me?
- Yeah.

364
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,005
What? No.

365
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,254
- Come on. Take it.
- No. Tony...

366
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,759
Just... Just talk.

367
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,353
Hello?

368
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,557
Good morning, Doctor.
It's nice to talk to you.

369
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:48,361
Well, yes, that is a long time.

370
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:52,537
It is.

371
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,869
Yes. I'm sure.

372
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:58,770
Thank you.

373
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,410
Thank you for calling.

374
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,166
Bye now.

375
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,051
What'd he say?

376
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,132
He wanted to know if I'd be okay

377
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:14,011
with him taking my husband away
from his family for two months.

378
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,681
He said he'd pay you
what you asked for.

379
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:24,943
Hey.

380
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:28,359
It's good money.

381
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,325
We need it.

382
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,909
Can't be eating 26
hot dogs every day.

383
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:39,918
I know.

384
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,753
I told him it was
okay for you to go.

385
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,995
All right. Hey, look. So here's
the first half of your pay.

386
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,893
You're gonna get the rest
when the tour's over.

387
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,512
No, I got to get paid every week.

388
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,518
Sorry. That's not how the
record company does it.

389
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,887
We got to have some guarantee
you're gonna finish the job.

390
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,636
Why wouldn't I finish the
job? I took it, didn't I?

391
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:02,143
Well, then we got
nothing to worry about.

392
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,526
Here's the deal, Mr
Vallelonga, okay?

393
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,772
It's your job to get Don to
all his tour dates on time.

394
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,314
Now, if he misses any shows,
you're not getting your back end.

395
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,195
- He's not gonna miss any show.
- Good.

396
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,201
Oh, you're gonna need this.

397
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:18,247
Now, this is the book I
was telling you about.

398
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,726
Sometimes you guys
are staying in the

399
00:24:19,727 --> 00:24:21,048
same hotel, sometimes you're not.

400
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,206
- Oh, yeah, the...
- Yeah, yeah.

401
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,292
All right, don't let
me down. Let's go.

402
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:37,178
Marone. Is this the new one?

403
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,883
Yeah, the record
company rented it.

404
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,802
- It's nice, huh?
- Beautiful.

405
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:43,024
So, what'd my sister
have to say about

406
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:44,393
you being gone for three weeks?

407
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:45,644
Eight weeks.

408
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:50,152
10-to-1, you slap this moolie out,
you come home in under a month.

409
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,523
- Come here.
- All right, boys, huddle up.

410
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,937
- Say goodbye to your father.
- Frankie, Nicky. Come here.

411
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,177
All right. You gonna be good boys?

412
00:24:58,178 --> 00:24:59,178
Huh.

413
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:00,431
You'll listen to your mother?

414
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,831
Yeah? All right, give me a kiss.

415
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,620
I'm counting on youse.

416
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,203
- Don't go too far.
- We won't.

417
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,798
Did you go to the
AAA for the maps?

418
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:13,799
Yes.

419
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,763
No. I mean, the record companies
gave me the maps and the itinerary

420
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:17,849
and this thing.

421
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,892
The Negro Motorist's Green Book.

422
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,249
Yeah, it lists all the places
coloureds can stay down south.

423
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:27,061
Like, you know,
travelling while black.

424
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,767
"Travelling while black"?

425
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,604
Yeah, if you're black and you
got to travel for some reason.

426
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,189
- Got a special book for that?
- I guess.

427
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:37,450
- Did you pack the iron?
- I ain't lugging no iron, Dee.

428
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,055
How are you gonna
press your pants?

429
00:25:39,056 --> 00:25:40,495
I'll put them under the mattress.

430
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:44,916
I want you to write me a
letter every chance you get.

431
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:47,540
- I can't write letters.
- Yes, you can.

432
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,190
- I can't write.
- Take you five minutes.

433
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,671
- Promise me.
- It's embarrassing.

434
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:51,965
It ain't gonna be no good.

435
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,668
It's a lot cheaper than
calling long-distance, Tony.

436
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,336
Promise me you're gonna write.

437
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:58,139
I promise.

438
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,802
Dee, put this in the bank
today. It's half my pay.

439
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,064
Oh, here. There's a couple of
sandwiches for you and Dr Shirley.

440
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,635
- Thanks.
- Be careful.

441
00:26:10,636 --> 00:26:11,636
I will.

442
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:12,653
I love you.

443
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:14,822
I love you, too, baby.

444
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:22,492
You better be home for Christmas,
or don't come home at all.

445
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:30,082
I got it, Pop. I got it.

446
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,739
Hey. I'm Tony.

447
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:00,618
His driver.

448
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:01,953
Bum a smoke?

449
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:08,543
Thanks.

450
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,260
So you're the band?

451
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:23,139
Oleg. Cello.

452
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:25,304
George. Bass.

453
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,761
And we're not a
band. We're a trio.

454
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:30,764
Oh. Trio. Right.

455
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:33,066
Good morning. Excuse me.

456
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,152
Morning.

457
00:27:58,844 --> 00:27:59,925
Thank you, Amit.

458
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,255
Have a wonderful trip, sir.

459
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,479
Tony, the first thing I'd like you

460
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,997
to do when we arrive
in the city...

461
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,814
is check the piano
where I'm playing.

462
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,581
Make sure it's a Steinway
as per my contract.

463
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,969
And can you see to it that
there's a bottle of Cutty Sark

464
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,172
in my room every night?

465
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,183
Every night?

466
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:33,144
Well, if you ever need
any help with that.

467
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:34,850
I won't.

468
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,274
10:00 and 2:00 on
the wheel, please.

469
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,614
Hey, Doc.

470
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,073
I noticed on the itinerary thing

471
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,531
the last show's on the
23rd of December, right?

472
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,863
Birmingham, yes. It's
a Christmas show.

473
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:54,870
So, any way we could, maybe hit
the road early next morning

474
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,792
so we'd be home in time
for Christmas Eve?

475
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:57,914
We'll see.

476
00:29:58,797 --> 00:29:59,797
Appreciate it.

477
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,082
Could you put out the
cigarette, please?

478
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,760
Why?

479
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,086
I can't breathe back here.

480
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,077
What are you talking about?

481
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:13,809
Smoke's going in my lungs.
I'm doing all the work here.

482
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:14,895
Thank you.

483
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:08,864
What are you looking at?

484
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,614
You speak German, huh?

485
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,740
That was Russian.

486
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,701
Yeah, I was stationed
in Germany in the army.

487
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,529
I could pick up a little bit
of what you were saying there.

488
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,377
Watch out for them krauts.

489
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,291
They're all snakes.

490
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:26,086
Kennedy should've bombed
them when he had the chance.

491
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:28,213
Plus now them Cuban bastards.

492
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,005
Ain't they supposed
to be following us?

493
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,265
They have the itinerary.

494
00:31:34,351 --> 00:31:35,951
As long as they get
to the show on time,

495
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,102
I'm not worried about it,
and neither should you.

496
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,646
I ain't worried about nothing.

497
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,977
In fact, when you see me
worried, you'll know.

498
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,270
- Tony.
- You'll know if I'm worried.

499
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:47,637
How about some quiet time?

500
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:50,068
Sure.

501
00:31:53,078 --> 00:31:55,616
It's amazing you said that.

502
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:57,997
"How about some quiet time?"

503
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,784
Dolores, my wife, used to
say that all the time.

504
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,618
Well, not all the
time, but, you know.

505
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,524
She says it when I come
home from work sometimes.

506
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:06,228
You know, she's been
with the kids all day,

507
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,671
and she'll say, "Tony, how
about some quiet time?"

508
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:11,757
Exactly like how you said
it. I mean, it's amazing.

509
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:20,438
How is that?

510
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,607
Salty.

511
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,700
Have you ever considered
becoming a food critic?

512
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,817
No. Not really.

513
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,430
Why? Is there money in that?

514
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,691
I'm just saying you
have a marvellous

515
00:32:37,692 --> 00:32:39,869
way with words when
describing food.

516
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:41,995
"Salty."

517
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:45,290
So vivid, one can almost taste it.

518
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,920
Hey, I'm just saying it's
salty. And salt's cheating.

519
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:52,005
Any cook can make things salty.

520
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,489
To make it taste good
without the salt,

521
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,800
with just the other
flavours, that's the trick.

522
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,258
I mean, you take the
basic ingredients...

523
00:32:57,259 --> 00:32:59,019
We should get going
soon if we expect

524
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,502
to get to Pittsburgh by dinner.

525
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:05,311
Hey, when I was in the army, I
knew a guy from Pittsburgh.

526
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,816
Except he called it Titsburgh.

527
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:11,025
Because he said all the
women there had huge tits.

528
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:13,866
That's absurd.

529
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,053
Why would women in Pittsburgh
have larger breasts

530
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,490
than, say, women in New York?

531
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,866
Guess we'll find out, huh?

532
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:24,455
Hey, you know, when
you first hired me,

533
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:27,064
my wife went out and bought
one of your records.

534
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,579
The one about the orphans.

535
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,755
Orphans?

536
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:35,340
Yeah. Cover had a bunch of kids
sitting around a campfire.

537
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,425
Orpheus.

538
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:40,309
Yeah.

539
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:43,018
Orpheus in the Underworld.
It's based on a French opera.

540
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,475
And those weren't
children on the cover.

541
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:48,023
Those were demons in
the bowels of hell.

542
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:52,358
No shit? Must have
been naughty kids.

543
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,286
What are... What are you doing?

544
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,622
Gotta take a leak, Doc.

545
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,298
Here? Now?

546
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,001
You want me to piss my pants?

547
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,706
- Oh, hey, Doc.
- Good afternoon.

548
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:39,590
Take this for any
incidentals we may need.

549
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:42,241
If you want to buy something,
you don't have to ask.

550
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,131
Just keep the receipts, please.

551
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,016
When it runs low, let me know.

552
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:47,514
Oh. Thanks.

553
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:48,979
One more thing.

554
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:55,067
We'll be attending many events
before and after the concerts,

555
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,631
interacting with some
of the wealthiest

556
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,612
and most highly educated
people in the country.

557
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,650
It is my feeling
that your diction,

558
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:04,569
however charming it may
be in the tri-state area,

559
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,655
could use some... finessing.

560
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:10,245
You mean diction...
like in what way?

561
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,748
Like in the only way
the word is ever used.

562
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:15,839
Okay.

563
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,833
Your intonation, inflection,
your choice of words.

564
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,297
Hey, I got my own problems.

565
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:23,880
Now I got to worry about what
people think about the way I talk?

566
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,181
There are simple techniques I can

567
00:36:25,182 --> 00:36:26,535
teach you that are
quite effective.

568
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,559
I can help you.

569
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,093
I don't need no goddamn help.

570
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,468
People don't like the way I
talk, they can go take a shit.

571
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,603
The profanity is another issue.

572
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:37,185
Fanabola. Why are you
breaking my balls?

573
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,144
Because you can do
better, Mr Vallelonga.

574
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,480
Which brings me to one more point.

575
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,878
As the guest of honour,
I'll be introduced

576
00:36:43,879 --> 00:36:45,610
when entering these
intimate events.

577
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,320
You will be introduced as well.

578
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:52,537
In my humble opinion, "Vallelonga"
may be difficult to pronounce.

579
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,869
So, I was thinking

580
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:57,024
"Valle" would be more appropriate.

581
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,631
Tony Valle. Short and sweet.

582
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,800
Nah.

583
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:04,319
They got a problem
with "Vallelonga,"

584
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,366
they can call me Tony Lip.

585
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,173
These are genteel people.

586
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,679
"Tony the Lip" may be a little...

587
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:12,061
worldly for them.

588
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:14,138
Well, then it's Tony Vallelonga.

589
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:17,775
All these high-class people,
so much smarter than me,

590
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:20,148
with their intelligence
and speaking abilities,

591
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,078
you're telling me they
can't pronounce my name?

592
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,157
They don't like it, they
can shove it up their ass.

593
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,274
I'll just wait outside.

594
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:28,698
A sound compromise.

595
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:48,222
Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight we are privileged

596
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:51,221
to present a great
American artist.

597
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,934
He gave his first public
performance at the age of three.

598
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,558
At age 18, at Arthur
Fiedler's invitation,

599
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:02,565
our guest made his concert
debut with the Boston Pops.

600
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,725
He holds doctorates
in psychology, in

601
00:38:05,726 --> 00:38:08,284
music, and in the liturgical arts,

602
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:12,363
and he has performed at the White
House twice in the past 14 months.

603
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,870
He is a true virtuoso.

604
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,541
- And it's a...
- "Virtuoso."

605
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,963
- It's a special treat for me...
- That's Italian.

606
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,464
Means, he's really good.

607
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:28,172
So, ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome the Don Shirley Trio.

608
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,140
A new pair of shoes.

609
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,524
- Hard ten. Lady's friend.
- He keeps on winning.

610
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,009
It's your dice. I'm just
having a lucky night.

611
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,194
You cheating, brother.

612
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:14,197
- Tony.
- Get him again. Get him again.

613
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,574
- Boss man's calling.
- He ain't my boss.

614
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,996
I work for the record company.

615
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,602
Yeah, I work for the
record company, too.

616
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:21,037
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, come on, man.

617
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,164
Hey, give us a chance to
win back our loot, huh?

618
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,745
I'm sorry, fellas. Duty calls.

619
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,580
- Come on, man.
- Duty calls?

620
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:29,375
My man, my duty is to
get my money back.

621
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,255
I've been looking for you.

622
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,804
Yeah, sorry. The guys were
having a little game.

623
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,924
Next time you need extra
money, just ask me.

624
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,388
It's more fun winning it.

625
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,095
And what if you lost?

626
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:43,731
Craps and cards, I
don't lose, Doc.

627
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,228
I don't lose.

628
00:40:46,486 --> 00:40:47,766
So, stooping down in the gravel,

629
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,937
pitching dice for pocket
change makes you a winner?

630
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,615
What are you giving me shit
for? Everybody was doing it.

631
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:56,573
They didn't have a choice
whether to be inside or out.

632
00:40:58,206 --> 00:40:59,206
You did.

633
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,576
Now wipe off your knees.
You have dirt on them.

634
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:27,900
Dear Dolores, how are you?

635
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,526
I am fine.

636
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:33,072
"I'm eating real good.
Hamburgers mostly.

637
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,067
So don't worry about
me not eating good.

638
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:40,117
I saw Dr Shirley play
the piano tonight.

639
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,619
He don't play like a coloured guy.

640
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:45,122
He plays like
Liberace, but better.

641
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,249
He's like a genius, I think.

642
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,748
When I look at him in
the rearview mirror,

643
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:53,505
I can tell he's always thinking
about stuff in his head.

644
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,840
I guess that's what geniuses do.

645
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,634
But it don't look fun
to be that smart.

646
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,385
I miss you very, very much."

647
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:14,028
- Who is this?
- Who?

648
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,568
On the radio.

649
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:18,285
Little Richard.

650
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:21,153
Really? That's Little Richard?

651
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,247
Yeah.

652
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,340
Think you could play
something like that, Doc?

653
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:28,497
I don't know. Sounds
fairly complicated.

654
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,333
Got that right.

655
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,458
So, where did this "Tony the
Lip" moniker come from?

656
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:37,510
It's not "Tony the Lip."

657
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:39,801
It's "Tony Lip." One word.

658
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,098
I got it when I was a kid,

659
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:44,427
because my friend said I was the
best bullshit artist in the Bronx.

660
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:47,012
Why are you smiling?

661
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:48,648
What do you mean?

662
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,396
It doesn't bother you
that your friends,

663
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:53,773
the people closest to
you, consider you a liar?

664
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:57,152
Who said "liar"? I said
"bullshit artist."

665
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,698
And what's the difference?

666
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:00,902
Because I don't lie. Ever.

667
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,821
I'm just good at talking
people into, you know,

668
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,372
doing things they
don't want to do.

669
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:07,033
By bullshitting them.

670
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:09,626
And you're proud of that?

671
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:11,412
Well, it got me this job.

672
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,661
Wait a minute.
You're full of shit.

673
00:43:18,662 --> 00:43:20,428
You never heard of Chubby Checker?

674
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:23,349
Of course I've heard of him. I've
just never heard his music before.

675
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,097
But I like this. This is nice.

676
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:29,020
He's got a silky
voice, very smooth.

677
00:43:29,021 --> 00:43:30,101
Yeah, he's terrific.

678
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:31,752
This is what everybody's
dancing to now.

679
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:33,438
- This stuff...
- Eyes on the road, Tony.

680
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:37,904
You know this song.

681
00:43:39,075 --> 00:43:40,191
I don't think so, no.

682
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:43,994
How could you not know this
music? Aretha Franklin.

683
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,706
Chubby Checker, Little
Richard, Sam Cooke.

684
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:50,375
I mean, come on, Doc.
These are your people.

685
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:06,995
Do you want anything? I'm
getting a pack of smokes.

686
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,019
No, thank you.

687
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:39,917
Grabbed the rock and
put it in his pocket.

688
00:44:40,011 --> 00:44:41,011
Thank you, Oleg.

689
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:44,338
Nice turtleneck. Way to mix it up.

690
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:49,351
Got you an apple, Doc.

691
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,692
Before we pull out, Tony,
we need to have a talk.

692
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:02,614
- Yeah?
- Oleg told me what you did.

693
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:04,034
What'd I do?

694
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:06,402
You stole a jade stone
from the store.

695
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,532
- No, I didn't.
- He watched you do it.

696
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:10,455
I didn't steal no stone.

697
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,373
You picked it up and
put it in your pocket.

698
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:15,453
I picked up a rock off the ground.
I didn't steal from a box.

699
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,441
Now, why would you pick
up a rock off the ground?

700
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:18,465
I don't know.

701
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,755
Because it ain't stealing.
It's just a regular rock.

702
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,507
And why would you
want a regular rock?

703
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:27,715
To have. For luck maybe.

704
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:28,889
A lucky rock.

705
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:30,387
- Yeah.
- Let me see it.

706
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:46,904
Take it back and pay for it.

707
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,183
I told you that kraut was a snake.

708
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:53,494
Rats me out for something
I didn't even do.

709
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:55,562
Pay for the stone, Tony.
You'll feel better.

710
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,864
I feel fine. And I
ain't paying for

711
00:45:57,865 --> 00:46:00,206
no regular rock I
found in the dirt.

712
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:03,300
Do not drive, Mr Vallelonga.

713
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:08,472
Put it back.

714
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,455
- Feel better?
- No.

715
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,788
If you'd like, Tony, I'd
happily buy you the stone.

716
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,829
Don't bother. You took
all the fun out of it.

717
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,663
Excuse me. Sir.

718
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,087
- I'm with the band.
- You're all set up.

719
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:25,590
This isn't the piano, right?

720
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:26,676
That's it.

721
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,255
It ain't a Steinway.

722
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:30,347
So what?

723
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:33,216
Dr Shirley only plays on
Steinway grand pianos.

724
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:34,925
It's in his written contract.

725
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:36,430
Who's Dr Shirley?

726
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,605
Dr Shirley. The Don Shirley
Trio. They're playing tonight.

727
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:41,898
Does it really matter?

728
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:44,526
Yeah, it does. It's
in his contract.

729
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:47,938
Come on, man.

730
00:47:48,032 --> 00:47:50,445
These coons can play on anything
you put in front of them.

731
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:56,245
But it's a piece of shit.

732
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:57,868
And there's garbage in there.

733
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,292
So take it out.

734
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,252
What'd you say?

735
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:04,214
You heard me.

736
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:11,886
Hey. You got two, three hours.
Just get a clean Steinway in here.

737
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,861
There ain't a Steinway on campus.

738
00:48:13,862 --> 00:48:14,862
Not my problem.

739
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:18,250
I bet there's not two Steinways
in the whole state of Indiana.

740
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,595
I guess you'd better
move your ass, then.

741
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,726
Who you think you're
talking to, greaseball?

742
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,091
Dear Dolores,

743
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:57,845
this morning I had steak
and eggs for breakfast.

744
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:01,394
The band has been playing
at very ritzy joints.

745
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:04,397
Dr Shirley and I are
getting along pretty good.

746
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,520
But sometimes I think he gets sad,

747
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,693
and that's why he drinks too much.

748
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:12,694
I never knew how very
beautiful this country was.

749
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,775
Now that I'm seeing it, I know.

750
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:17,605
You won't believe how
beautiful nature

751
00:49:17,606 --> 00:49:19,784
is. It is as beautiful
as they say.

752
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,299
And the traffic out
here in the country

753
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,955
is nothing, which is fine by me.

754
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:27,625
Right now I'm eating spaghetti
and meatballs in a diner

755
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:30,423
that tastes like ketchup
on Chinese noodles.

756
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,675
We are heading down south now.

757
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,845
I will write you another
letter when we get down south.

758
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,639
I love you. Your husband, Tony.

759
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:40,683
PS. Kiss the kids for me.

760
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,894
Got any family, Doc?

761
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:52,444
Not really.

762
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:55,239
Not really? Either
you do or you don't.

763
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,443
It's a long story, Tony.

764
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,453
What, we're in a hurry now?

765
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:03,958
Let's hear it.

766
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,081
I have a brother somewhere.

767
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:10,084
We used to get together
once in a while,

768
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:12,791
but it got more and more
difficult to stay in touch.

769
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,669
Curse of being a
musician, I guess.

770
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,171
Always on the road.

771
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,723
Like a carnival worker.

772
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,801
Or a criminal.

773
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:25,729
Took quite the toll on
my marriage as well.

774
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,935
- You're married?
- Was.

775
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,266
June.

776
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:34,028
Good person. Terrible
grammar, but a kind soul.

777
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:35,780
You'd quite like her.

778
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:39,075
June. Like, like Lassie's mum.

779
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:43,917
Unfortunately, I
couldn't do a husband

780
00:50:43,918 --> 00:50:45,741
act and a concert pianist act.

781
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,286
Couldn't seem to
manage both worlds.

782
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:53,207
Kentucky fried chicken.

783
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,755
In Kentucky. When's
that ever gonna happen?

784
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:09,732
All right.

785
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:12,776
Hey, you want some?

786
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:15,103
- I'm fine. Thank you, Tony.
- All right.

787
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:22,407
I think this is the best Kentucky
fried chicken I ever had.

788
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:24,922
Probably because it's
fresher down here, right?

789
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:27,324
I don't think I've ever met
anyone with your appetite.

790
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:30,161
No. I got the bucket so
you could have some.

791
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:32,837
I've never had fried
chicken in my life.

792
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:34,665
Who you bullshitting?

793
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:38,589
You people love the fried chicken,
the grits, and the collard greens.

794
00:51:39,263 --> 00:51:40,263
I love it, too.

795
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:43,348
Negro cooks used to make it all
the time when I was in the army.

796
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:45,767
You have a very narrow
assessment of me, Tony.

797
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,969
Yeah, right? I'm good.

798
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:51,019
No. No, you're not
good. You're bad.

799
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:53,255
I'm saying, just
because other Negroes

800
00:51:53,256 --> 00:51:54,522
enjoy certain types of music,

801
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:55,853
it doesn't mean I have to.

802
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:58,333
Nor do we all eat the
same kind of food.

803
00:51:58,334 --> 00:51:59,610
Whoa. Wait a minute.

804
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:03,448
If you said all guineas like pizza
and spaghetti and meatballs,

805
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:04,618
I'm not gonna get insulted.

806
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:06,071
You're missing the point.

807
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:08,125
For you to make the assumption
that every Negro...

808
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:09,783
- Hey, you want some or not?
- No.

809
00:52:10,294 --> 00:52:11,294
Here. Come on.

810
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,377
- Tell me that don't smell good.
- It...

811
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:15,251
- Huh?
- It smells okay.

812
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:18,459
I prefer not to get
grease on my blanket.

813
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:21,386
Ooh, I'm gonna get
grease on my blankey.

814
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,158
Come on, have a piece.
It ain't gonna kill you.

815
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:24,468
- Come on, take it, eat it.
- No.

816
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,675
Take it. I'm throwing
it in the back.

817
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:28,852
- You... Don't you dare.
- Then you better take it.

818
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:31,475
How? Do you have
plates or utensils?

819
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,227
Baffangul. Eat it with your hands.

820
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:35,003
- That's how you're supposed to.
- I can't do that.

821
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:36,362
Eat it. Come on. Take it. I got to

822
00:52:36,363 --> 00:52:37,815
drive. 10:00 and
2:00 on the wheel.

823
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:39,056
Come on. Take it,
take it, take it.

824
00:52:39,057 --> 00:52:40,880
- Tony...
- Come on, come on.

825
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,152
There you go.

826
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,118
Huh?

827
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:46,244
I can't do this, Tony.

828
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:48,287
Eat the goddamn thing.

829
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,249
Jesus.

830
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:01,801
What, no good?

831
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:09,221
It just seems...

832
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:12,936
so un... unsanitary.

833
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,264
Who gives a shit?

834
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,349
Just relax and enjoy it.

835
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,064
You know, my father used to say...

836
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:22,606
"Whatever you do, do
it a hundred percent."

837
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:25,863
When you work, work.
When you laugh, laugh.

838
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:28,536
When you eat, eat like
it's your last meal.

839
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,533
You want another piece?
Here. Have a breast.

840
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:33,960
Delicious.

841
00:53:35,129 --> 00:53:36,495
Take it. Here you go.

842
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:39,039
What do we do about the bones?

843
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:43,261
We do this.

844
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:46,428
This is what we do.

845
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:55,732
There you go.

846
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:09,786
What's the big deal, Doc? The
squirrels would've ate it anyway.

847
00:54:09,872 --> 00:54:10,872
Pick it up, Tony.

848
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:12,183
Nature takes care of the earth.

849
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,994
- Pick it up.
- Ah, jeez.

850
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,279
This can't be right.

851
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:56,161
It says right here, "Cosy
as your own home."

852
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:59,293
Place looks like my ass.

853
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,041
This is the place.

854
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,178
The square one, please.

855
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:12,633
- Just this one?
- Thank you.

856
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:19,681
Hey, if you need anything,

857
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:21,641
I'll be right up the
street at the Easton Inn.

858
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:23,694
Thank you, Tony.

859
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:29,775
Hey, Floyd, we ready.

860
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:32,531
I told you I can't
play. My shoulder.

861
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:34,157
You and that damn shoulder.

862
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:39,117
Hey. Hey, fancy-pants.
You want to play?

863
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,170
I beg your pardon?

864
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,003
Come on, brother. We short a man.

865
00:55:44,216 --> 00:55:45,707
Oh, I'd rather not.

866
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:48,589
What, you too high and mighty?

867
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:50,671
No, no, let him
alone. Let him alone.

868
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:53,552
He just afraid of getting that
butler uniform a little dusty.

869
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:54,976
Mm.

870
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:57,351
I'm just...

871
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:00,351
I'm on my way to meet a friend.

872
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,312
Yeah, well, thanks for nothing.

873
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:07,612
Floyd, come on, man.

874
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:09,690
Shut your ass up, man,
and leave me alone.

875
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:47,561
"Vacation without aggravation."

876
00:56:57,247 --> 00:57:00,661
"Delightful dinners for
particular people."

877
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,502
- Yeah?
- Get up. It's George.

878
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:05,749
Get up.

879
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:09,124
Tony, come on. Hurry up.

880
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,255
Dr Shirley's in trouble.

881
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,511
I went out for a drink,
I walk into this bar,

882
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:16,558
and Dr Shirley's in there
getting bounced around.

883
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:19,132
I didn't want to leave him,
but I didn't know what to do.

884
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,680
Who let him out of his cage?

885
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:22,558
And they put that
little tie on him, too.

886
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:23,917
- Why you all dressed up?
- Yeah.

887
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:27,562
Get your hands off him.

888
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:33,189
What in the good goddamn
we got here, fellas?

889
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:36,367
Hand him over. We walk
out. Won't be a problem.

890
00:57:36,745 --> 00:57:38,953
I just wanted a drink, Tony.

891
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:40,621
Hey, I told you we'll leave.

892
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,874
- Not a big deal. Come on.
- He ain't going nowhere.

893
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:45,873
We need a Brillo Pad to
wash these dishes with.

894
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:47,670
Listen, assholes.

895
00:57:47,756 --> 00:57:50,169
Do yourselves a favour
and let him go.

896
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:52,093
Now.

897
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:55,636
Say it nice.

898
00:57:56,807 --> 00:57:58,218
I just said it nice.

899
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:01,969
This boy is gonna get what
he's got coming to him.

900
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:07,432
And you, you ain't got no say.

901
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:13,028
Maybe. But whatever happens here,

902
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:16,825
I'm gonna put a bullet right in
the middle of your thick skull.

903
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:21,662
He ain't got no gun,
Ray. He's full of shit.

904
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,032
What if he ain't?

905
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,837
Well, I sure ain't.

906
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:34,300
And I ain't about to let this
come to pass in my place.

907
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,839
Let the spook go. Let him go.

908
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:41,934
Come on.

909
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:44,478
Get him out of here.

910
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:48,230
I want these Yankees
off my property.

911
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,774
- Go on.
- Go on, George. Go. Go.

912
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:51,897
I got you, Doc.

913
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,481
Go on.

914
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,621
You out of your mind?

915
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:08,122
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
put you in that position.

916
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,248
Wait, wait, wait.

917
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:12,000
Are you gonna throw up again?

918
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:15,921
I'm okay.

919
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:18,257
Honest to God, Doc, I
don't understand you.

920
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:20,974
You could have drunk here.
You got a whole bottle.

921
00:59:21,475 --> 00:59:23,011
I just needed some air.

922
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:25,434
Air? Do you know where you are?

923
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:28,896
Does geography really matter?

924
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:31,358
What?

925
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:34,611
If I was in a bar in
your neighbourhood,

926
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:38,360
would the conversation
be any different?

927
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:43,077
From now on, you don't
go nowhere without me.

928
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:44,905
Nowhere.

929
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:47,748
- Got it?
- I understand.

930
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:50,669
Where's your room?

931
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,254
Tony.

932
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,256
What?

933
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,212
Do you really have a gun?

934
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,134
Of course not.

935
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,926
Doc, where's your goddamn room?

936
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:08,053
- Come on.
- There it is.

937
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,146
Over there?

938
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:10,889
You got to get to bed, Doc.

939
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:12,689
You got a big show
tomorrow night. Come on.

940
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:34,874
Thank you.

941
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,298
Louisville.

942
01:00:36,842 --> 01:00:38,754
Thank you for your
warm hospitality.

943
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:46,679
Thank you. Thank you.

944
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:55,985
Don't be lazy, Tony. Enunciate.

945
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:56,986
I am.

946
01:00:57,028 --> 01:00:58,648
Betty bought a bit
of better butter

947
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:00,001
to make the bitter butter better.

948
01:01:00,002 --> 01:01:01,002
Betty bought...

949
01:01:01,003 --> 01:01:03,991
Bought... Betty bought
butta-er... butta...

950
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:06,535
Who says that? Butta-er.

951
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:09,308
You have to start somewhere, Tony.
A singer does vocal exercises.

952
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:11,244
An athlete warms up
before they rehearse.

953
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,166
Athletes practise.
They don't rehearse.

954
01:01:14,546 --> 01:01:17,630
Ah, shit.

955
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:47,505
Ladies and gentlemen, a very
special guest from the far north,

956
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,088
Don Shirley.

957
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:56,813
Accompanying Mr Shirley,
the members of his trio,

958
01:02:56,898 --> 01:03:00,266
Oleg Malacovich, George Dyer,

959
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:03,103
and his associate Tony Valle...

960
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:05,279
Valle... Vallelong-longia.

961
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,195
Oh, this is my lovely
wife, Margaret.

962
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:15,998
If you gentlemen don't mind,
we're going to steal Donnie away

963
01:03:16,084 --> 01:03:17,746
for some, introductions.

964
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:22,376
I'd like you all to
meet Don Shirley.

965
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:24,924
Yeah. I'll take one.

966
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:26,010
What's that?

967
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:27,343
A pimento-and-cheese
sandwich, sir.

968
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,011
Yeah, I'll try one of them.

969
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:33,058
Oof.

970
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:41,483
Sorry. Not for me.

971
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:52,021
Earlier this week,
we asked our help

972
01:03:52,022 --> 01:03:54,158
what Mr Shirley might
like for supper.

973
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:56,484
So the boys in the
kitchen whipped up a

974
01:03:56,485 --> 01:03:58,245
special menu in
honour of our guest.

975
01:03:58,710 --> 01:03:59,710
Gentlemen.

976
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,411
Home-cooked fried chicken.

977
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:10,628
There we go.

978
01:04:11,014 --> 01:04:12,926
Bring it in. Serve it up hot.

979
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:45,546
Thank you. Thank you.

980
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:49,215
We'll return after a
brief intermission.

981
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:53,470
Excuse me, Don.

982
01:04:54,349 --> 01:04:56,591
- Lovely work in there.
- Why, thank you.

983
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:58,300
Are you looking for the commode?

984
01:04:58,395 --> 01:04:59,914
- Yes. I...
- Yeah, here. Let me help you.

985
01:04:59,938 --> 01:05:02,225
It's right out there
before that pine.

986
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:09,440
I'd prefer not to use that.

987
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:11,281
Well, don't be
silly, Don. It looks

988
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:12,740
a lot worse from the outside.

989
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:15,492
And I suppose you'd
know from experience.

990
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,410
Well, I've never had
any complaints.

991
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:25,044
Well, I could return to my motel
and use the facilities there...

992
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:28,547
but that would take at
least a half an hour.

993
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,094
We don't mind waiting.

994
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:39,091
Why don't I just pull over?
You can piss in the woods.

995
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:41,059
Animals go in the woods.

996
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:42,567
It's gonna be at least
20 minutes I got

997
01:05:42,568 --> 01:05:43,916
to go all the way
back to your motel.

998
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,728
So let's just get there so I can
go back and finish the show.

999
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:49,731
See, that's the difference
between you and me.

1000
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:51,257
I'd have zero problem
going in the woods.

1001
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:52,281
I'm well aware.

1002
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:56,359
What are you sore at me for? I
don't make the rules down here.

1003
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:59,287
No? Then who does?

1004
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:04,292
Oh. You're saying just because
I'm white and they're white?

1005
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:07,356
You know, that's a very prejudiced
thing you just said there.

1006
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:08,996
A very prejudiced thing.

1007
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:11,878
I got more in common with the
hymies at Second Avenue Deli

1008
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,960
than I do with these
hillbilly pricks down here.

1009
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:15,214
Eyes on the road.

1010
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:17,843
You always say that when you
don't like what I'm saying.

1011
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:19,343
Eyes on the road.

1012
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,187
I don't get it.

1013
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:28,016
How does he smile and shake
their hands like that?

1014
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:30,887
They try to pull that
outhouse shit on me,

1015
01:06:30,888 --> 01:06:32,820
I'd piss right on the
living room floor.

1016
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:35,943
Don't... Don't do that.

1017
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:40,736
We have many concert dates left.

1018
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:44,907
Yeah? So?

1019
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:48,085
You realise we're contractually
obliged to perform them?

1020
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:52,585
Of course I do. You don't
play, we don't get paid.

1021
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:54,510
What's your point?

1022
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:57,678
Ugly circumstances are
going to happen again,

1023
01:06:58,389 --> 01:06:59,880
so control yourself.

1024
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:02,512
Don't lecture me, you rat.

1025
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:07,350
Dr Shirley could
have stayed up north

1026
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,063
getting rear end kissed at Park

1027
01:07:09,064 --> 01:07:11,104
Avenue parties for
three times money.

1028
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:13,773
But he ask for this.

1029
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:19,826
Why?

1030
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:41,343
What on God's green
earth are you doing?

1031
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:43,225
A letter.

1032
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:45,722
Looks more like a
piecemeal ransom note.

1033
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:48,099
May I?

1034
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,737
"Dear Dolores."

1035
01:07:58,241 --> 01:07:59,322
D-E-A-R.

1036
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:00,650
This is an animal.

1037
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:04,862
"I'm meeting all the highly
leading citizens of the town.

1038
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:09,166
People that use big
words, all of them.

1039
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:12,085
But you know me. I get by.

1040
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:13,746
I'm a good bullshitter."

1041
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:15,748
Two T's in "bullshitter."

1042
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:20,427
"As I'm writing this letter,
I'm eating potato chips,

1043
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:23,889
and I'm starting to get thirsty.

1044
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:27,931
I washed my socks and
dried them on the TV.

1045
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:31,055
I should have brung the iron."

1046
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:32,560
You know this is pathetic, right?

1047
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,470
Tell me what you're trying to say.

1048
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:37,195
I don't know.

1049
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:40,193
You know, I miss her and shit.

1050
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:41,444
Then say that.

1051
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:44,902
But do it in a manner that no one
else has ever done it before.

1052
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:46,954
And without the profanity.

1053
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:49,664
Something like...

1054
01:08:50,752 --> 01:08:51,788
Put this down.

1055
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:56,038
Dear Dolores.

1056
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:57,498
Hold on. I'll start a new one.

1057
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:01,336
D-E-A-R Dolores.

1058
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,172
When I think of you...

1059
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:10,765
I'm reminded of the
beautiful plains of Iowa.

1060
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:12,433
What planes?

1061
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:14,477
The plains.

1062
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:17,692
P-L-A-I-N-S. Those
big fields we saw.

1063
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:19,816
Oh. Yeah, those were nice.

1064
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:21,406
Plains.

1065
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:25,576
Which is what they call

1066
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:29,159
big fields around here.

1067
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:30,872
Tony, no expounding.

1068
01:09:31,668 --> 01:09:33,204
- No what?
- Just write what I say.

1069
01:09:33,795 --> 01:09:34,831
No good.

1070
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:37,838
The distance between us...

1071
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:41,212
is breaking my spirit.

1072
01:09:42,804 --> 01:09:44,170
Between us...

1073
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:48,967
My time and experiences without
you are meaningless to me.

1074
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:56,857
Falling in love with you was the
easiest thing I've ever done.

1075
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:02,025
Falling... in love... with you...

1076
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:04,569
This is very fucking romantic.

1077
01:10:05,326 --> 01:10:08,160
Was the easiest thing
I have ever done.

1078
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:10,954
Nothing matters to me but you,

1079
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:14,787
and every day I'm alive,
I'm aware of this.

1080
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:19,042
I loved you the day I met
you, I love you today,

1081
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:22,292
and I will love you
the rest of my life.

1082
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,804
So, can I put, "PS.
Kiss the kids"?

1083
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:28,890
A PS?

1084
01:10:29,517 --> 01:10:30,553
Yeah, like, at the end.

1085
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:35,600
That's like clanging a cowbell at
the end of Shostakovich's Seventh.

1086
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:39,144
Right. And that's good?

1087
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,231
It's perfect, Tony.

1088
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:49,239
Everybody talks about
Willie Mays, 1954.

1089
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:51,661
It wasn't even the greatest
catch in the Polo Grounds.

1090
01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:55,913
That was Joe DiMaggio, 1936,
second game of the World Series.

1091
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:58,710
Final out, 500 feet...

1092
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:03,673
You like that, Doc?

1093
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,126
That's a handsome suit.

1094
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:06,630
Sharp.

1095
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:09,012
Guy looks just like you.

1096
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:11,427
He does?

1097
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,431
Well, size-wise. Yeah.

1098
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:19,098
It is about a 42.

1099
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:23,144
Why don't you try it on?

1100
01:11:23,237 --> 01:11:25,445
What, you got to wear a
tuxedo on stage every night?

1101
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:27,864
You could mix it up a little, Doc.

1102
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:30,488
Come on, let's see how it looks
on you. We got plenty of time.

1103
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:35,123
I'll be right back.

1104
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,412
- How you doing?
- May I help you, sir?

1105
01:11:38,503 --> 01:11:41,587
Yeah, we want to try on that,
beautiful grey suit in the window.

1106
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:44,126
- You got it in a 42?
- Of course.

1107
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:48,637
That's the one.

1108
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,462
Dressing room is in the back, sir.

1109
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,382
Thank you. I'll be just a moment.

1110
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:56,264
Take your time, Doc. I'll
check out some ties for you.

1111
01:11:57,897 --> 01:12:01,732
Excuse me. You're not
allowed to try that on.

1112
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:05,070
I beg your pardon?

1113
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:07,565
If you'd like to
purchase it first, we'd

1114
01:12:07,566 --> 01:12:09,816
be happy to tailor
it to your needs.

1115
01:12:12,495 --> 01:12:13,495
I see.

1116
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:03,920
Ah.

1117
01:13:16,267 --> 01:13:17,267
Yeah.

1118
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:19,895
That's me.

1119
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:35,196
Hey, Officer. I got a
call about Dr Shirley.

1120
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:37,078
Come on.

1121
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:43,416
His friend's here.

1122
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:46,087
Thank you.

1123
01:13:50,968 --> 01:13:53,051
Get a guy a towel,
for Christ's sake.

1124
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:55,303
- You a lawyer?
- No.

1125
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:56,408
Well, you should call one.

1126
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,094
- We're taking your auntie in.
- For what?

1127
01:13:58,184 --> 01:14:00,392
Manager caught him
and the other guy.

1128
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:06,723
Well, can we get
the cuffs off him,

1129
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:09,059
let him put his pants
on, we talk about this?

1130
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:10,689
Sure, we could.

1131
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,280
But we ain't.

1132
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:16,234
Okay, look, we're out of
here tomorrow morning.

1133
01:14:16,327 --> 01:14:17,443
You'll never see us again.

1134
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:20,074
There's got to be something
we can do to work this out.

1135
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:24,617
What if you let him go and I
give you something to thank you?

1136
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:27,540
You bribing us?

1137
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:29,496
No. Hell, no.

1138
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:31,798
A gift. A thank you.

1139
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,088
What kind of thank you?

1140
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:36,337
Like a...

1141
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:38,342
You know, donation
to the police force.

1142
01:14:38,432 --> 01:14:39,513
Youse guys.

1143
01:14:40,518 --> 01:14:41,518
Whatever you want.

1144
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:44,144
You like suits?

1145
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:46,809
I was walking through
your nice town today,

1146
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:49,141
and I seen a store that
was selling suits.

1147
01:14:50,277 --> 01:14:51,563
Primo suits.

1148
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:54,818
What if, as a thank
you... a donation...

1149
01:14:55,741 --> 01:14:57,027
I buy youse each a suit?

1150
01:14:58,786 --> 01:15:01,824
You get all dressed up, you
take the wife out for dinner.

1151
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:05,491
I mean, guys like you, you
work hard. You deserve it.

1152
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:16,316
They were wrong for the way they
treated me, and you rewarded them.

1153
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:21,139
I was hired to get you
from one show to the next.

1154
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:23,091
How I do it shouldn't
matter to you.

1155
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:24,767
I just wish you
hadn't paid them off.

1156
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:26,186
I did what I had to do.

1157
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:29,751
You know, if this got out,
it would kill your career.

1158
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:30,856
Okay, Tony.

1159
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:34,026
I need you to stop it
with the phoney altruism

1160
01:15:34,113 --> 01:15:35,445
and concern for my career.

1161
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:37,115
What the hell does that mean?

1162
01:15:37,116 --> 01:15:38,996
You were only thinking
about yourself back there

1163
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:41,819
because you know if I miss a show,
it'll come out of your pocketbook.

1164
01:15:41,912 --> 01:15:45,030
Of course I don't want you to miss
a show, you ungrateful bastard.

1165
01:15:45,124 --> 01:15:46,865
You think I'm doing
this for my health?

1166
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:49,333
Tonight, I saved your ass.

1167
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:51,582
So show a little
appreciation maybe.

1168
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:54,502
Besides, I told you never
to go nowhere without me.

1169
01:15:56,427 --> 01:15:59,090
I assumed you'd want this
to be the exception.

1170
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:38,504
Want me to get some make-up or
something for the show tomorrow?

1171
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:39,960
No, I'm fine.

1172
01:16:40,054 --> 01:16:42,216
You sure? Bruise kind of shows.

1173
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:43,592
I said I'm fine.

1174
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:46,101
Okay.

1175
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:55,504
He didn't ask me to do that.

1176
01:16:55,528 --> 01:16:57,408
I'm telling you, that's
what he told me.

1177
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:58,607
He didn't ask me.

1178
01:16:58,697 --> 01:17:01,314
Oh. Tony Lip.

1179
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:04,651
Dominic, Mags. What the hell
you guys doing down here?

1180
01:17:04,745 --> 01:17:05,826
Hey, Brooklyn sent us down.

1181
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:08,200
- Take care of a few things.
- Yeah.

1182
01:17:42,992 --> 01:17:44,358
I'm working here.

1183
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,327
Sorry, Doc. They're some
friends from New York.

1184
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:58,500
Hey, can you get Dr
Shirley's luggage?

1185
01:17:58,591 --> 01:17:59,591
All right.

1186
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:34,874
Called his room. Be
down in a minute.

1187
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:46,544
- Hey, Doc.
- Where are you off to?

1188
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:52,343
I'm just going downstairs.
To have a drink.

1189
01:19:03,781 --> 01:19:04,781
Tony.

1190
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:07,399
I think you're doing
a wonderful job.

1191
01:19:09,036 --> 01:19:10,036
So...

1192
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:14,406
I'd like to formally offer you
the position of my road manager.

1193
01:19:15,084 --> 01:19:18,748
With the title also comes
more responsibility, but...

1194
01:19:20,214 --> 01:19:21,750
that also means a raise in pay.

1195
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:24,423
No. No.

1196
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:25,591
No, thanks.

1197
01:19:27,972 --> 01:19:32,057
We agreed on 125 a
week, plus expenses.

1198
01:19:32,142 --> 01:19:34,099
That's our deal, right?

1199
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:38,392
I ain't going nowhere, Doc.

1200
01:19:38,482 --> 01:19:40,098
I was just going
down to tell them.

1201
01:19:50,953 --> 01:19:51,953
Tony.

1202
01:19:57,334 --> 01:19:59,121
I'm sorry about last night.

1203
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:04,331
Don't worry about it.

1204
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:09,878
I've been working nightclubs in
New York City my whole life.

1205
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:11,429
I know it's a...

1206
01:20:12,683 --> 01:20:14,299
complicated world.

1207
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:29,231
So, where'd you learn
how to play like that?

1208
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:30,325
My mother.

1209
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:32,655
Your mother? Really?

1210
01:20:35,122 --> 01:20:37,284
She taught me how to
play on an old spinet.

1211
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:43,329
Soon as I could walk, we'd travel
around the Florida Panhandle,

1212
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:46,589
put on my little shows
in parishes and halls.

1213
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:49,092
Fortunately, a man
who had seen me play

1214
01:20:49,511 --> 01:20:52,754
arranged for me to study at the
Leningrad Conservatory of Music.

1215
01:20:53,349 --> 01:20:55,386
I was the first Negro
ever accepted there.

1216
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:58,343
That's where they taught you
all them songs you play?

1217
01:20:58,437 --> 01:21:00,599
Actually, I was trained
to play classical music.

1218
01:21:01,315 --> 01:21:05,434
Brahms, Franz Liszt,
Beethoven, Chopin.

1219
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:08,194
It's all I ever wanted to play.

1220
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:12,107
But I was persuaded
by my record company

1221
01:21:12,201 --> 01:21:14,909
to pursue a career in
popular music instead.

1222
01:21:15,913 --> 01:21:18,781
They insisted that audiences would
never accept a Negro pianist

1223
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:20,285
on a classical stage.

1224
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:23,873
Wanted to turn me into just
another coloured entertainer.

1225
01:21:25,714 --> 01:21:28,878
You know, the guy who's
smoking while he's playing

1226
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:31,425
and sets a glass of
whiskey on his piano

1227
01:21:31,512 --> 01:21:33,677
and then complains
because he's not

1228
01:21:33,678 --> 01:21:35,722
respected like Arthur Rubinstein.

1229
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:38,908
You don't see Arthur
Rubinstein putting

1230
01:21:38,909 --> 01:21:41,053
a glass of whiskey on his piano.

1231
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:46,479
I don't know. Personally, I think
if you stuck to the classic stuff,

1232
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:48,059
it would've been a big mistake.

1233
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:52,364
A mistake? Performing the music I
trained my entire life to play?

1234
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:55,070
Trained? What are you, a seal?

1235
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,068
People love what you do.

1236
01:21:57,162 --> 01:22:00,496
Anyone could sound like
Beethoven or "Joe Pan"

1237
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:02,118
or them other guys you said.

1238
01:22:02,209 --> 01:22:05,668
But your music, what you do...

1239
01:22:08,215 --> 01:22:09,422
only you can do that.

1240
01:22:12,678 --> 01:22:13,839
Thank you, Tony.

1241
01:22:18,892 --> 01:22:20,679
But not everyone can play Chopin.

1242
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:24,012
Not like I can.

1243
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:30,940
The trees have shed
their leafy clothing,

1244
01:22:31,405 --> 01:22:33,818
and their colours have
faded to greys and browns.

1245
01:22:34,366 --> 01:22:38,201
"I saw millions of trees
all dusted with snow,

1246
01:22:38,287 --> 01:22:39,994
just like out of a fairy tale."

1247
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,992
He's so expressive.

1248
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,664
Got to admit, Lip's
letters, they're not bad.

1249
01:22:46,753 --> 01:22:47,994
Oh, well, it's in the family.

1250
01:22:48,464 --> 01:22:50,706
They say our
great-great-great-grandfather

1251
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:53,041
helped da Vinci with
the Sixteen Chapel.

1252
01:22:53,135 --> 01:22:55,548
- You mean Michelangelo.
- Right.

1253
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:57,879
What does Michelangelo have
to do with writing letters?

1254
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:00,556
I'm just saying, we're
an arty family.

1255
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:05,057
"I will count the hours,
minutes, and seconds

1256
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:07,139
until you are in my arms.

1257
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:09,064
Love you, Tony.

1258
01:23:09,151 --> 01:23:10,642
PS. Kiss the kids."

1259
01:23:12,154 --> 01:23:13,645
- John.
- Yeah?

1260
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:15,817
I want a letter.

1261
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:17,983
Yeah, soon as you make a meal.

1262
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:35,216
Eyes forward, Tony.

1263
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:01,783
Tony.

1264
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:05,739
All right, everybody. Let's give
our finest Louisiana welcome

1265
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:08,700
to Don Shirley and the
Don Shirley Trio.

1266
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:37,646
Your mother's ass.

1267
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:41,278
Can't see shit.

1268
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:49,202
What the hell's this guy doing?

1269
01:24:52,879 --> 01:24:54,620
Son of a bitch.

1270
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:09,101
Licence and papers.

1271
01:25:09,896 --> 01:25:11,603
Am I glad to see you.

1272
01:25:12,065 --> 01:25:16,526
We had to turn off the main
road, and, now we're lost.

1273
01:25:18,822 --> 01:25:20,279
Step out of the car.

1274
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:23,157
- What'd I do?
- Out of the car.

1275
01:25:35,172 --> 01:25:36,754
Why are you on this road?

1276
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:41,467
I told you. We had to make
a detour, and we got lost.

1277
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:48,136
And why are you driving him?

1278
01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:50,135
He's my boss.

1279
01:25:56,568 --> 01:26:00,027
He can't be out here at
night. This a sundown town.

1280
01:26:00,697 --> 01:26:01,778
What's that?

1281
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:05,859
Get him out of the car
and check his ID.

1282
01:26:05,952 --> 01:26:08,160
Oh, come on. It's pouring rain.

1283
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:11,243
Sir, I can just get it right
here through the window.

1284
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:12,665
Get him out of the car.

1285
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:15,785
Come on, get out now.
Get out now. Get out.

1286
01:26:17,089 --> 01:26:18,205
Got ID?

1287
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:23,008
How you say this last name?

1288
01:26:24,054 --> 01:26:25,170
Vallelonga.

1289
01:26:26,515 --> 01:26:29,303
- Yeah, what kind of name is that?
- It's Italian.

1290
01:26:30,394 --> 01:26:34,980
Oh. Oh, I see. That's why
you're driving him around.

1291
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:38,604
You're half a nigger yourself.

1292
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:43,358
Hands in the air. Now. Now.

1293
01:26:46,702 --> 01:26:47,702
Excuse me.

1294
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:53,660
Excuse me, sirs.

1295
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:58,628
I understand why my
associate is being held,

1296
01:26:58,714 --> 01:27:01,047
but what exactly am I
being charged with?

1297
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:06,802
You seem like reasonable men.

1298
01:27:07,723 --> 01:27:08,930
Perhaps you could let me out

1299
01:27:09,015 --> 01:27:10,972
so that we could discuss
the situation further.

1300
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:13,176
Just put the apple
butter away, boy.

1301
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:15,853
You ain't going
nowhere no time soon.

1302
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:19,432
You cannot hold me without cause.

1303
01:27:19,526 --> 01:27:20,733
Oh, I got cause.

1304
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:23,686
Because you let the sun
set on your black ass.

1305
01:27:25,532 --> 01:27:27,319
I want to speak to my lawyer.

1306
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:29,366
I want my call.

1307
01:27:29,828 --> 01:27:32,741
This is a flagrant
violation of my rights.

1308
01:27:33,749 --> 01:27:34,910
You know...

1309
01:27:36,626 --> 01:27:40,415
he does have, rights.

1310
01:27:45,469 --> 01:27:47,677
Give the Negro his
goddamn phone call.

1311
01:27:48,638 --> 01:27:49,638
You happy?

1312
01:27:54,644 --> 01:27:56,055
You know a lawyer?

1313
01:27:56,772 --> 01:27:57,772
Call him.

1314
01:28:09,242 --> 01:28:10,929
I walk up to the car
and I say, "Sir,

1315
01:28:10,930 --> 01:28:12,482
you know how fast you were going?"

1316
01:28:12,746 --> 01:28:15,284
He says, "I'm sorry, Officer. I
didn't mean to speed, but"...

1317
01:28:15,373 --> 01:28:18,332
As my mother always said, "What
kind of brand-new fool are you?"

1318
01:28:19,252 --> 01:28:20,493
Look at them over there.

1319
01:28:21,755 --> 01:28:23,355
Take a good look at
the officer you hit.

1320
01:28:23,632 --> 01:28:26,124
Look at him. He's over there
having a grand old time,

1321
01:28:26,218 --> 01:28:30,383
chatting up with his pals,
enjoying a nice cup of coffee.

1322
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:32,380
And where are you?

1323
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:35,433
In here, with me, who did nothing.

1324
01:28:36,478 --> 01:28:38,219
Yet I'm the one who
pays the price.

1325
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:40,646
I'm the one who's gonna
miss the Birmingham show.

1326
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:42,463
Hey, I'm gonna lose
a lot of money,

1327
01:28:42,464 --> 01:28:44,146
too, if you don't play Birmingham.

1328
01:28:44,236 --> 01:28:47,400
So, that little temper
tantrum, was it worth it?

1329
01:28:51,034 --> 01:28:52,400
You never win with violence, Tony.

1330
01:28:52,494 --> 01:28:55,077
You only win when you
maintain your dignity.

1331
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:57,951
Dignity always prevails.

1332
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:01,833
And tonight, because
of you, we did not.

1333
01:29:07,509 --> 01:29:09,421
I wouldn't touch
that mattress, Doc.

1334
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:11,798
Maryville Police.

1335
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:16,100
No, sir.

1336
01:29:16,935 --> 01:29:18,642
No, no, I'm not, sir.

1337
01:29:19,688 --> 01:29:21,520
Yes, sir. He's right
here, sir. Yes, sir.

1338
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:23,190
Yes, sir.

1339
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:25,025
Gimme.

1340
01:29:25,694 --> 01:29:26,855
Chief Pratt. Who's this?

1341
01:29:27,529 --> 01:29:28,529
Baloney.

1342
01:29:31,449 --> 01:29:34,738
Yes, sir. I can hear
it now, Governor.

1343
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:40,448
No, sir. I'm sorry.

1344
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:43,034
No, of course I can recognise
your voice. It's...

1345
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:47,381
Sir?

1346
01:29:48,592 --> 01:29:51,585
You're saying the boy we
got locked up called who?

1347
01:29:55,015 --> 01:29:57,052
Oh, and he called you.

1348
01:29:57,559 --> 01:29:58,720
No... No, sir.

1349
01:29:59,352 --> 01:30:01,765
An officer was assaulted
in the line of duty.

1350
01:30:04,774 --> 01:30:05,774
No, sir. No.

1351
01:30:05,775 --> 01:30:09,143
I don't want no National Guard
coming down here neither, sir.

1352
01:30:10,572 --> 01:30:12,279
I'll get to it
immediately, Governor.

1353
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:15,240
Good night to you and the missus.

1354
01:30:20,123 --> 01:30:21,534
- Get them out.
- What?

1355
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:23,324
Cut them goddamn loose.

1356
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:25,000
That dago wop hit me.

1357
01:30:25,545 --> 01:30:27,286
You want to keep your goddamn job?

1358
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:29,348
Then you do what I
goddamn tell you to

1359
01:30:29,349 --> 01:30:31,215
do when I goddamn
tell you to do it.

1360
01:30:31,301 --> 01:30:33,588
And I'm telling you to get
them the goddamn out.

1361
01:30:34,304 --> 01:30:35,465
Who the hell did you call?

1362
01:30:38,808 --> 01:30:41,141
Bobby Kennedy just
saved our asses.

1363
01:30:41,227 --> 01:30:43,469
Marone. How great is that?

1364
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:45,600
It's not great.

1365
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:47,390
It's not great at all.

1366
01:30:47,484 --> 01:30:49,817
- It's humiliating.
- The hell you talking about?

1367
01:30:49,903 --> 01:30:51,815
We were screwed. Now we ain't.

1368
01:30:52,739 --> 01:30:55,106
And I just put the attorney
general of the United States

1369
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,566
in an incredibly awkward position.

1370
01:30:56,660 --> 01:30:59,277
So what? That's what
the guy gets paid for.

1371
01:30:59,371 --> 01:31:00,612
What else he got to do?

1372
01:31:01,164 --> 01:31:04,657
That man and his brother are
trying to change this country.

1373
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:06,287
That's what else he got to do.

1374
01:31:07,921 --> 01:31:09,708
Now he thinks I'm some kind of...

1375
01:31:11,591 --> 01:31:14,550
Calling from some...
backwoods swamp jail,

1376
01:31:14,636 --> 01:31:16,298
asking to attenuate
assault charges?

1377
01:31:16,388 --> 01:31:17,754
Who does that?

1378
01:31:17,847 --> 01:31:21,386
Garbage. That's who. You
shouldn't have hit him.

1379
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:22,954
I didn't like the way
he was treating you,

1380
01:31:22,978 --> 01:31:24,844
making you stand out
in the rain like that.

1381
01:31:24,938 --> 01:31:27,851
Please, you hit him because
of what he called you.

1382
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:30,733
I've had to endure that kind
of talk my entire life.

1383
01:31:30,819 --> 01:31:32,797
You should be able to take
it for at least one night.

1384
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:34,166
What? I can't get
mad at that stuff

1385
01:31:34,167 --> 01:31:35,549
he was saying because
I ain't black?

1386
01:31:35,573 --> 01:31:37,030
Christ, I'm blacker than you are.

1387
01:31:37,117 --> 01:31:38,117
Excuse me?

1388
01:31:38,118 --> 01:31:40,405
You don't know shit about
your own people...

1389
01:31:40,495 --> 01:31:43,579
what they eat, how they
talk, how they live.

1390
01:31:43,639 --> 01:31:45,040
You don't even know who
Little Richard is.

1391
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:48,000
Oh, so, knowing who Little Richard
is makes you blacker than me?

1392
01:31:48,795 --> 01:31:51,082
Oh, Tony, I wish you could
hear yourself sometimes.

1393
01:31:51,172 --> 01:31:52,879
You wouldn't talk so damn much.

1394
01:31:52,966 --> 01:31:56,425
Bullshit. I know exactly who I am.

1395
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:57,750
I'm the guy who lived in the same

1396
01:31:57,751 --> 01:31:59,365
neighbourhood in the
Bronx my entire life

1397
01:31:59,389 --> 01:32:02,427
with my mother, my father, my
brother, and now my wife and kids.

1398
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:04,509
That's it. That's who I am.

1399
01:32:04,602 --> 01:32:07,060
I'm the asshole who has to
hustle every goddamn day

1400
01:32:07,147 --> 01:32:08,479
to put food on the table.

1401
01:32:08,565 --> 01:32:11,603
You, Mr Big Shot, you
live on top of a castle,

1402
01:32:11,693 --> 01:32:14,401
travelling around the world
doing concerts for rich people.

1403
01:32:14,487 --> 01:32:17,070
I live on the streets.
You sit on a throne.

1404
01:32:17,157 --> 01:32:19,865
So, yeah, my world is way
more blacker than yours.

1405
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:24,112
- Pull over.
- What?

1406
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:26,743
- Pull over.
- I ain't pulling over.

1407
01:32:26,833 --> 01:32:28,040
Stop the car, Tony.

1408
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:31,786
What?

1409
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:33,212
What are you doing?

1410
01:32:34,424 --> 01:32:35,424
Doc.

1411
01:32:37,886 --> 01:32:39,593
Doc, what the hell are you doing?

1412
01:32:40,263 --> 01:32:42,471
Doc. Get back in the car.

1413
01:32:43,183 --> 01:32:45,550
Yes, I live in a
castle, Tony. Alone.

1414
01:32:47,854 --> 01:32:49,854
And rich white people pay
me to play piano for them

1415
01:32:49,939 --> 01:32:51,379
because it makes
them feel cultured.

1416
01:32:51,733 --> 01:32:53,213
But as soon as I
step off that stage,

1417
01:32:53,276 --> 01:32:55,563
I go right back to being
just another nigger to them.

1418
01:32:56,946 --> 01:32:58,562
Because that is
their true culture.

1419
01:32:59,657 --> 01:33:01,192
And I suffer that
slight alone because

1420
01:33:01,193 --> 01:33:02,570
I'm not accepted by my own people,

1421
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:04,117
because I'm not like them either.

1422
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:08,035
So if I'm not black enough
and if I'm not white enough

1423
01:33:08,124 --> 01:33:11,242
and if I'm not man enough,
then tell me, Tony, what am I?

1424
01:33:46,246 --> 01:33:47,908
I need some sleep.

1425
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:52,292
All right.

1426
01:33:53,294 --> 01:33:56,753
I'll stop at the next place we
see and sneak you into my room.

1427
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:58,331
No. No.

1428
01:33:58,424 --> 01:34:00,270
I refuse to stay in
an establishment

1429
01:34:00,271 --> 01:34:01,417
where I'm not welcome.

1430
01:34:04,347 --> 01:34:06,134
Yeah. Okay.

1431
01:34:24,284 --> 01:34:26,071
Tony, do you have to
smoke everywhere?

1432
01:34:29,164 --> 01:34:30,405
I didn't know it bothered you.

1433
01:34:30,999 --> 01:34:32,331
You should have told me.

1434
01:34:33,960 --> 01:34:35,952
All you got to do is
say the word, Doc.

1435
01:34:49,184 --> 01:34:51,767
You do realise you'll be home
before that letter arrives.

1436
01:34:52,520 --> 01:34:55,558
Yeah, I know. Just thought
I'd bring it with me.

1437
01:34:55,648 --> 01:34:57,014
Save on stamps.

1438
01:34:57,775 --> 01:34:58,775
All right.

1439
01:34:59,903 --> 01:35:01,769
Tony, give it here. I'll fix it.

1440
01:35:03,031 --> 01:35:06,945
No offence, Doc, but I think
I got the hang of it now.

1441
01:35:14,417 --> 01:35:15,828
"Dear Dolores,

1442
01:35:16,294 --> 01:35:18,456
sometimes you remind
me of a house.

1443
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:24,212
A house with beautiful
lights on it...

1444
01:35:25,303 --> 01:35:27,420
where everyone is happy inside."

1445
01:35:32,977 --> 01:35:35,560
Yes, Tony. You got it.

1446
01:35:36,481 --> 01:35:37,481
Yeah?

1447
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:40,436
Thanks.

1448
01:35:43,696 --> 01:35:48,191
Hey, Doc, thanks for helping
me with, the letters.

1449
01:35:48,785 --> 01:35:50,242
You're really good
at writing them.

1450
01:35:51,204 --> 01:35:52,661
My pleasure, Tony.

1451
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:56,456
You know, when you get home,

1452
01:35:56,542 --> 01:35:59,205
maybe you should write...
write one to your brother.

1453
01:36:02,548 --> 01:36:04,835
He knows where I am if he
ever wants to reconnect.

1454
01:36:05,718 --> 01:36:07,801
I wouldn't wait.

1455
01:36:09,847 --> 01:36:11,008
You know...

1456
01:36:12,058 --> 01:36:14,926
world's full of lonely people
afraid to make the first move.

1457
01:36:22,944 --> 01:36:24,981
Yeah, I'll finish this tomorrow.

1458
01:36:36,416 --> 01:36:40,205
You know, Doc, something's been
eating at me this whole trip.

1459
01:36:44,173 --> 01:36:46,631
That Titsburgh was a
major disappointment.

1460
01:36:46,718 --> 01:36:49,301
I didn't notice any
difference at all. Did you?

1461
01:36:49,971 --> 01:36:51,257
Good night, Tony.

1462
01:37:04,027 --> 01:37:06,314
- Good evening.
- Welcome, welcome. Come on in.

1463
01:37:09,991 --> 01:37:10,991
All righty.

1464
01:37:14,245 --> 01:37:16,237
Welcome, Mr Shirley.

1465
01:37:16,331 --> 01:37:17,822
Graham Kindell. I'm the general

1466
01:37:17,823 --> 01:37:19,745
manager. It is a
pleasure to meet you.

1467
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:21,312
Thank you, Mr Kindell.

1468
01:37:21,336 --> 01:37:22,918
This is Mr Tony Vallelonga.

1469
01:37:23,004 --> 01:37:24,481
- Nice to meet you, Tony.
- How you doing?

1470
01:37:24,505 --> 01:37:27,418
Let's keep the car right here
in our "guest of honour" spot.

1471
01:37:27,508 --> 01:37:29,249
Right this way, gentlemen.

1472
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:30,880
- Nice.
- How was your drive up?

1473
01:37:30,970 --> 01:37:33,410
- Oh, it was wonderful.
- Good to hear. Good to hear.

1474
01:37:33,514 --> 01:37:34,829
As you can imagine, our Christmas

1475
01:37:34,830 --> 01:37:36,382
show is our biggest
show of the year,

1476
01:37:36,476 --> 01:37:38,843
and we are so happy to
have you here, Mr Shirley.

1477
01:37:38,936 --> 01:37:41,929
So, if you need anything,
anything at all, you let me know.

1478
01:37:42,023 --> 01:37:44,390
- Thank you.
- Now, here we are.

1479
01:37:44,484 --> 01:37:47,192
We got about an hour before
show time. Any questions?

1480
01:37:48,696 --> 01:37:49,696
Where's the restaurant?

1481
01:37:50,073 --> 01:37:51,985
Well, you continue down
the hall here, Tony,

1482
01:37:52,075 --> 01:37:53,611
to the right and across the lobby.

1483
01:37:53,701 --> 01:37:56,114
- Good luck. Break a leg.
- Thank you.

1484
01:37:58,373 --> 01:38:01,457
Well, he said we got an hour.
You must be starving, Doc.

1485
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:02,999
Go ahead. I'll meet you there.

1486
01:38:29,904 --> 01:38:30,904
May we join you?

1487
01:38:31,948 --> 01:38:33,735
Yeah. Go ahead.

1488
01:38:39,872 --> 01:38:41,909
- Cocktail, gentlemen?
- I'm good.

1489
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:43,664
Three shots vodka.

1490
01:38:44,252 --> 01:38:45,252
Oh.

1491
01:38:45,878 --> 01:38:49,212
Last show. Cold War
over. Time for truce.

1492
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:52,490
Is Dr Shirley in
his dressing room?

1493
01:38:53,094 --> 01:38:55,336
Yeah. More like half
a broom closet.

1494
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:58,172
Tell you, I don't know how
he puts up with that shit.

1495
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:05,558
Six years ago, in 1956...

1496
01:39:06,566 --> 01:39:08,808
Nat King Cole was
invited to perform

1497
01:39:08,901 --> 01:39:11,735
at the Municipal Auditorium
here in Birmingham.

1498
01:39:12,989 --> 01:39:15,514
Mr Cole was the first
Negro asked to play

1499
01:39:15,515 --> 01:39:17,859
at a white establishment
in this city.

1500
01:39:17,952 --> 01:39:19,284
As soon as he started playing,

1501
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:22,454
a group of men attack him for
playing white people's music.

1502
01:39:24,250 --> 01:39:25,786
They pull him off stage...

1503
01:39:27,211 --> 01:39:28,452
and beat him badly.

1504
01:39:29,297 --> 01:39:30,538
Jesus Christ.

1505
01:39:34,635 --> 01:39:38,879
You asked me once why
Dr Shirley does this.

1506
01:39:40,266 --> 01:39:41,382
I tell you.

1507
01:39:41,893 --> 01:39:44,135
Because genius is not enough.

1508
01:39:44,896 --> 01:39:47,684
It takes courage to
change people's hearts.

1509
01:39:55,656 --> 01:39:56,656
Thanks.

1510
01:39:57,867 --> 01:39:58,903
Thank you.

1511
01:40:00,745 --> 01:40:02,737
Nu? Na zdorov'ye.

1512
01:40:03,831 --> 01:40:04,867
Thank you very much.

1513
01:40:08,169 --> 01:40:09,730
- Good evening.
- Can I help you?

1514
01:40:09,754 --> 01:40:10,754
Oh...

1515
01:40:14,175 --> 01:40:16,292
There. Some friends of mine.

1516
01:40:16,385 --> 01:40:18,968
You... You can't come in here.

1517
01:40:27,522 --> 01:40:29,684
- I understand, but...
- Hey. What's going on?

1518
01:40:30,441 --> 01:40:34,185
This... gentleman says that I'm
not permitted to dine here.

1519
01:40:34,695 --> 01:40:36,778
No, you don't understand.
He's playing tonight.

1520
01:40:36,864 --> 01:40:37,966
He's the main event. Come on.

1521
01:40:37,990 --> 01:40:41,279
I'm sorry, but it is the
policy of the restaurant.

1522
01:40:41,369 --> 01:40:42,450
Everything all right?

1523
01:40:42,537 --> 01:40:43,869
No, it's not all right.

1524
01:40:44,330 --> 01:40:46,868
This guy's saying Dr
Shirley can't eat here.

1525
01:40:46,958 --> 01:40:49,120
Oh, well, I apologise, but...

1526
01:40:49,544 --> 01:40:52,127
These are long-standing
traditions, club rules.

1527
01:40:52,213 --> 01:40:53,329
I'm sure you understand.

1528
01:40:53,714 --> 01:40:55,296
No, I do not understand.

1529
01:40:55,675 --> 01:40:57,467
In 45 minutes, I will
be right up there

1530
01:40:57,468 --> 01:40:59,259
on that stage
entertaining your guests,

1531
01:40:59,345 --> 01:41:00,461
yet I can't eat here?

1532
01:41:00,555 --> 01:41:02,547
I'm sorry.

1533
01:41:03,057 --> 01:41:05,925
Wait a minute. Are you telling
me the bozos in his band

1534
01:41:06,018 --> 01:41:08,135
and all these people who
came here to see him play,

1535
01:41:08,229 --> 01:41:09,345
they can eat here,

1536
01:41:09,772 --> 01:41:13,015
but the star of the show, the
parking spot of honour, he can't?

1537
01:41:14,026 --> 01:41:15,312
I'm afraid not.

1538
01:41:15,820 --> 01:41:18,358
Well, he's got to eat. I mean,
he's got to have dinner.

1539
01:41:20,741 --> 01:41:22,528
Okay. I'll tell you what.

1540
01:41:22,618 --> 01:41:24,555
Why don't we bring something
to his dressing room, huh?

1541
01:41:24,579 --> 01:41:25,911
John, show him a menu.

1542
01:41:25,997 --> 01:41:29,866
No. I'm not eating in
that storage room.

1543
01:41:31,419 --> 01:41:33,581
Okay, well, if you prefer,

1544
01:41:33,671 --> 01:41:35,232
there's a very popular
establishment

1545
01:41:35,233 --> 01:41:36,835
right down the road,
the Orange Bird.

1546
01:41:36,924 --> 01:41:38,881
They'd be happy to feed you.

1547
01:41:41,304 --> 01:41:42,590
Doc, come here.

1548
01:41:44,265 --> 01:41:45,265
Just one second.

1549
01:41:46,601 --> 01:41:48,761
You know what, maybe that
other place is better anyway.

1550
01:41:48,811 --> 01:41:50,598
I mean, the dinner rolls
here are like rocks.

1551
01:41:50,688 --> 01:41:53,226
You just go over and... You
go over and come back.

1552
01:41:58,237 --> 01:41:59,853
It's the last show.

1553
01:41:59,947 --> 01:42:01,108
It's the bottom of the ninth.

1554
01:42:01,198 --> 01:42:03,038
Let's just get it over
with and we can go home,

1555
01:42:03,117 --> 01:42:04,574
get away from these pricks.

1556
01:42:05,578 --> 01:42:06,578
Huh?

1557
01:42:07,288 --> 01:42:08,529
Ah, there you go.

1558
01:42:08,623 --> 01:42:10,535
The fish is wonderful tonight.

1559
01:42:16,464 --> 01:42:17,955
Either I eat in this room...

1560
01:42:19,383 --> 01:42:21,124
or I'm not performing tonight.

1561
01:42:25,723 --> 01:42:27,464
May I have a word with you?

1562
01:42:41,405 --> 01:42:44,694
Mr Villanueva, you have to
talk sense to Mr Shirley.

1563
01:42:44,784 --> 01:42:47,743
Please make him understand. We're
not insulting him personally.

1564
01:42:47,828 --> 01:42:49,668
This is just the way
things are done down here.

1565
01:42:49,747 --> 01:42:51,704
Yeah, well, he's not
from down here.

1566
01:42:51,791 --> 01:42:54,078
Yeah, just... just ask
him to be reasonable.

1567
01:42:54,168 --> 01:42:55,220
I've got 400 guests in there

1568
01:42:55,221 --> 01:42:56,647
expecting to be
entertained tonight.

1569
01:42:56,671 --> 01:42:58,754
And Dr Shirley expects
to eat tonight.

1570
01:42:59,173 --> 01:43:01,631
Why can't you just make an
exception this one time?

1571
01:43:03,219 --> 01:43:04,300
Let me tell you a story.

1572
01:43:05,846 --> 01:43:09,010
You ever hear of the Boston
Celtics basketball club?

1573
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:10,100
Yeah.

1574
01:43:10,101 --> 01:43:11,677
Well, those boys came through here

1575
01:43:11,678 --> 01:43:13,727
couple years ago on a
barnstorming tour.

1576
01:43:13,813 --> 01:43:15,916
Seeing as they was the world
champions of the league and all,

1577
01:43:15,940 --> 01:43:17,964
we were tickled to
have them here, and

1578
01:43:17,965 --> 01:43:19,729
we rolled out the welcome waggon.

1579
01:43:19,819 --> 01:43:22,857
So, do you know what table their
big coon ate at that night?

1580
01:43:24,532 --> 01:43:25,532
No.

1581
01:43:25,533 --> 01:43:28,367
I don't, either, but
it wasn't one of ours.

1582
01:43:28,828 --> 01:43:30,410
Now, let's cut the bullshit.

1583
01:43:31,038 --> 01:43:32,398
Tell me what it's gonna take, huh?

1584
01:43:32,790 --> 01:43:35,453
Say, a hundred dollars,
you get your boy to play?

1585
01:43:37,712 --> 01:43:39,294
You think you can buy me?

1586
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:41,417
With all due respect, sir,

1587
01:43:41,507 --> 01:43:44,170
you wouldn't be in a job like
this if you couldn't be bought.

1588
01:43:44,719 --> 01:43:46,085
- You...
- Stop.

1589
01:43:46,178 --> 01:43:47,178
Tony.

1590
01:43:49,348 --> 01:43:50,634
It's all right.

1591
01:43:52,685 --> 01:43:53,892
I'll play...

1592
01:43:55,563 --> 01:43:56,895
if you want me to.

1593
01:44:11,370 --> 01:44:13,737
All right. Let's get
the fuck out of here.

1594
01:44:14,999 --> 01:44:16,740
What do you mean "Let's
get out of here"?

1595
01:44:17,418 --> 01:44:19,330
Where the hell do you
think you're going?

1596
01:44:19,795 --> 01:44:21,982
Don, don't do this. Now, you
signed a contract, and I...

1597
01:44:22,006 --> 01:44:24,123
I know you're the kind of
man who honours a contract.

1598
01:44:24,216 --> 01:44:26,236
Connie, Bill, everything's
gonna be fine. It's all right.

1599
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:27,592
You got a show to do, mister.

1600
01:44:27,678 --> 01:44:30,136
You turn yourself around
right now, goddamn it.

1601
01:44:30,222 --> 01:44:31,222
Right now.

1602
01:44:32,016 --> 01:44:34,133
This is why you people
don't work down here.

1603
01:44:34,226 --> 01:44:36,092
Because you're
unreliable. You hear me?

1604
01:44:36,187 --> 01:44:39,271
I shipped that goddamn Steinway
in from Atlanta for you.

1605
01:44:46,614 --> 01:44:49,277
Tony, are you hungry?

1606
01:44:49,909 --> 01:44:52,526
Does Betty like butta... er?

1607
01:44:56,081 --> 01:44:59,290
One, two...

1608
01:45:37,164 --> 01:45:38,164
You a cop?

1609
01:45:38,916 --> 01:45:40,248
Do I look Irish?

1610
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:42,621
What you want, baby?

1611
01:45:43,003 --> 01:45:44,539
Two Cutty Sarks, neat.

1612
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:45,630
Coming up.

1613
01:45:52,596 --> 01:45:55,464
Mm. Whatever your speciality
is, we'll take it.

1614
01:45:56,684 --> 01:45:58,141
Two Orange Birds.

1615
01:46:11,031 --> 01:46:12,818
I like what you did
back there, Doc.

1616
01:46:13,534 --> 01:46:14,866
You stood up for yourself.

1617
01:46:17,204 --> 01:46:19,321
It's like what your friend,
the president, said.

1618
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:21,121
"Ask not...

1619
01:46:22,710 --> 01:46:24,793
your country, what
you can do for it.

1620
01:46:25,629 --> 01:46:27,370
Ask what you do for yourself."

1621
01:46:29,216 --> 01:46:30,216
You know?

1622
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:36,885
So, darling, what you do,
all dressed up like that?

1623
01:46:37,433 --> 01:46:38,799
Nothing particularly important.

1624
01:46:40,853 --> 01:46:43,436
Shouldn't judge a
man by his clothes.

1625
01:46:43,522 --> 01:46:46,686
He's only the greatest
piano player in the world.

1626
01:46:46,775 --> 01:46:49,483
That right? You good?

1627
01:46:50,821 --> 01:46:53,564
Don't be shy, Doc.
Tell her who you are.

1628
01:46:53,657 --> 01:46:54,898
Don't tell me nothing.

1629
01:46:55,659 --> 01:46:56,659
Show me.

1630
01:47:03,334 --> 01:47:04,334
Come on.

1631
01:48:49,481 --> 01:48:50,481
Whoo.

1632
01:48:51,483 --> 01:48:53,850
Yeah. Yeah.

1633
01:50:23,534 --> 01:50:25,025
That's how you break a key.

1634
01:50:27,871 --> 01:50:29,362
Oh, that was a good time.

1635
01:50:29,456 --> 01:50:31,413
I'd do that once a month for free.

1636
01:50:31,834 --> 01:50:33,120
You were unbelievable.

1637
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:34,210
Hey, Tony.

1638
01:50:35,129 --> 01:50:37,041
I bet if we leave right
now, we can make it.

1639
01:50:37,506 --> 01:50:38,542
Make what?

1640
01:50:38,632 --> 01:50:41,249
Christmas Eve in New York City.

1641
01:50:45,639 --> 01:50:46,675
Oh, shit.

1642
01:50:57,401 --> 01:51:00,109
Don't ever flash a wad
of cash in a bar.

1643
01:51:09,997 --> 01:51:11,488
I knew you had a gun.

1644
01:51:36,690 --> 01:51:38,272
This could get bad, Doc.

1645
01:51:39,860 --> 01:51:41,726
Yes. It's a shame we don't have

1646
01:51:41,727 --> 01:51:44,195
something to protect
us on our journey.

1647
01:51:45,073 --> 01:51:46,530
Oh, I know.

1648
01:51:47,075 --> 01:51:49,863
Why don't you put your lucky
rock up on the dash, Tony?

1649
01:51:52,247 --> 01:51:53,533
Come on, Tony.

1650
01:51:54,082 --> 01:51:55,573
We need all the help we can get.

1651
01:52:01,131 --> 01:52:03,874
Thank you. I feel safer already.

1652
01:52:06,386 --> 01:52:08,628
You're a real prick,
you know that?

1653
01:52:31,954 --> 01:52:33,911
Ah, shit.

1654
01:52:43,674 --> 01:52:45,256
Goddamn cops.

1655
01:52:56,478 --> 01:52:58,414
What are you doing out here?

1656
01:52:58,438 --> 01:53:00,100
We're trying to get to New York.

1657
01:53:02,609 --> 01:53:04,191
Is there a problem, Officer?

1658
01:53:04,278 --> 01:53:05,394
Yeah.

1659
01:53:06,321 --> 01:53:08,075
I noticed your car
was tilting left.

1660
01:53:08,076 --> 01:53:09,735
Looks like your back tyre is flat.

1661
01:53:25,716 --> 01:53:27,548
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.

1662
01:53:41,606 --> 01:53:42,892
Okay, be careful, gentlemen.

1663
01:53:43,692 --> 01:53:46,150
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1664
01:53:46,903 --> 01:53:47,984
Thanks, Officer.

1665
01:54:00,667 --> 01:54:02,729
Weather advisory warning
this Christmas Eve

1666
01:54:02,753 --> 01:54:05,791
as a major snowstorm is
hitting the Eastern Seaboard

1667
01:54:05,881 --> 01:54:08,919
with the severest weather
in eastern Pennsylvania,

1668
01:54:09,009 --> 01:54:11,422
northern New Jersey,
and the five boroughs.

1669
01:54:12,012 --> 01:54:14,880
Travellers are advised to stay
off the New Jersey Turnpike.

1670
01:54:14,973 --> 01:54:17,511
All right, that's it. We're done.

1671
01:54:18,143 --> 01:54:19,850
I'm pulling us into
the next motel.

1672
01:54:20,562 --> 01:54:22,303
Keep going as long
as you can, Tony.

1673
01:54:22,397 --> 01:54:24,354
I can't keep my eyes open.

1674
01:54:25,025 --> 01:54:26,561
I'm getting hypnotised here.

1675
01:54:27,527 --> 01:54:29,644
Think my brain's gonna explode.

1676
01:54:32,199 --> 01:54:35,783
Hey, we gave it a shot, Doc.

1677
01:54:36,787 --> 01:54:38,028
What are you gonna do?

1678
01:54:46,922 --> 01:54:49,255
All right, the table is
set, ladies and gentlemen.

1679
01:54:49,341 --> 01:54:52,084
Don't run in the house.
Don't run in the house.

1680
01:54:55,555 --> 01:54:58,047
Mum, Frankie won't let me use it.

1681
01:54:58,141 --> 01:54:59,757
Frankie, let Nicky use it.

1682
01:54:59,851 --> 01:55:00,851
Use what?

1683
01:55:04,731 --> 01:55:06,188
Here it is.

1684
01:55:10,570 --> 01:55:12,482
Kids. Wash your hands.

1685
01:55:13,365 --> 01:55:16,358
Here we go. Alla
salute. Alla salute.

1686
01:55:16,993 --> 01:55:19,280
Dee. Do you need help
with the calzone?

1687
01:55:19,371 --> 01:55:21,237
- No, I'm fine. No.
- All right.

1688
01:55:21,331 --> 01:55:23,072
It's time to eat.

1689
01:55:46,231 --> 01:55:47,231
Tony.

1690
01:55:47,566 --> 01:55:48,773
Tony, wake up.

1691
01:55:52,654 --> 01:55:53,690
You all right?

1692
01:55:54,156 --> 01:55:56,239
You're home. Get inside.

1693
01:56:12,340 --> 01:56:13,340
Good night.

1694
01:56:14,301 --> 01:56:17,590
Wait, wait. Come... Come
up and meet my family.

1695
01:56:20,891 --> 01:56:22,348
Merry Christmas, Tony.

1696
01:56:24,811 --> 01:56:25,811
Hey...

1697
01:56:27,647 --> 01:56:29,058
Merry Christmas.

1698
01:56:51,338 --> 01:56:52,982
Hey, hey. You're gonna
choke on the bone.

1699
01:56:53,006 --> 01:56:54,406
I'm just getting
started over here.

1700
01:56:56,301 --> 01:56:58,167
- You got it? You got it.
- I got it.

1701
01:56:58,887 --> 01:57:00,879
- Dolores, do you need any help?
- No, no, honey.

1702
01:57:01,515 --> 01:57:03,928
- Not while I'm eating.
- Go ahead, smoke.

1703
01:57:04,684 --> 01:57:06,721
Oh.

1704
01:57:06,811 --> 01:57:09,349
Look who it is.
Shakespeare's home. Hey.

1705
01:57:09,689 --> 01:57:10,689
Dad.

1706
01:57:13,652 --> 01:57:14,652
Hey.

1707
01:57:15,529 --> 01:57:16,610
How are you?

1708
01:57:17,864 --> 01:57:18,980
You made it back.

1709
01:57:19,074 --> 01:57:20,406
Hey, Pop. Mwah.

1710
01:57:20,492 --> 01:57:22,358
- Merry Christmas.
- What a Christmas.

1711
01:57:22,452 --> 01:57:23,943
- Buon Natale.
- Tony, God bless.

1712
01:57:24,037 --> 01:57:25,448
- Hey.
- I'm glad you made it back.

1713
01:57:29,834 --> 01:57:31,666
Wonderful, wonderful.

1714
01:57:38,218 --> 01:57:39,709
- You hungry?
- I'm starving.

1715
01:57:39,803 --> 01:57:41,135
- Hey.
- All right. Sit down.

1716
01:57:41,763 --> 01:57:43,675
Anything left?

1717
01:57:43,765 --> 01:57:44,765
Let's go.

1718
01:57:56,987 --> 01:57:59,604
- Welcome home, Dr Shirley.
- Thank you, Amit.

1719
01:58:00,156 --> 01:58:01,488
I turned down your bed, sir.

1720
01:58:01,575 --> 01:58:03,487
Shall I unpack your luggage now?

1721
01:58:03,577 --> 01:58:06,661
No, no. Please, go
home to your family.

1722
01:58:07,747 --> 01:58:08,828
Thank you, sir.

1723
01:58:14,421 --> 01:58:15,753
Merry Christmas, sir.

1724
01:58:16,131 --> 01:58:17,292
Merry Christmas.

1725
01:59:08,475 --> 01:59:10,453
The holidays are just starting.

1726
01:59:10,477 --> 01:59:13,470
I love everything in white.

1727
01:59:13,563 --> 01:59:16,226
Always. Always with the kissing.

1728
01:59:16,316 --> 01:59:18,558
What? You never kiss me
like that at the table.

1729
01:59:18,652 --> 01:59:20,132
Why don't you ever
kiss me like that?

1730
01:59:21,321 --> 01:59:24,064
All right, all right, all
right. Relax, relax.

1731
01:59:27,243 --> 01:59:29,986
So, Tony, you all right?
You seem a little quiet.

1732
01:59:31,581 --> 01:59:34,369
Yeah. Nah, I'm just
tired, you know?

1733
01:59:35,669 --> 01:59:36,830
Long trip.

1734
01:59:40,799 --> 01:59:42,210
You take care of that thing?

1735
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:43,300
Oh.

1736
01:59:48,264 --> 01:59:49,264
Thanks.

1737
01:59:49,265 --> 01:59:50,597
Yeah, you owe me 75 bucks.

1738
01:59:51,434 --> 01:59:52,515
Seventy-five?

1739
01:59:53,144 --> 01:59:54,144
Charlie said 60.

1740
01:59:54,187 --> 01:59:56,520
Oh. I'm doing this for free?

1741
01:59:59,109 --> 02:00:00,441
Hey, Tony.

1742
02:00:00,527 --> 02:00:02,439
Tony, tell us about the trip.

1743
02:00:02,529 --> 02:00:03,690
You've been gone two months.

1744
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:05,271
Yeah, how was he, the tutsoon?

1745
02:00:05,365 --> 02:00:06,572
He get on your nerves?

1746
02:00:07,367 --> 02:00:08,528
Don't call him that.

1747
02:00:13,164 --> 02:00:14,164
All right.

1748
02:00:17,544 --> 02:00:19,831
Tony, you should have
seen the day last week

1749
02:00:19,921 --> 02:00:22,288
little Frankie climbed
up onto the TV.

1750
02:00:22,382 --> 02:00:24,294
I took a picture of
him. It was so cute.

1751
02:00:24,384 --> 02:00:25,966
He was so funny up there.

1752
02:00:26,052 --> 02:00:28,385
What are you, nuts, Dee? With
all the tubes back there?

1753
02:00:28,471 --> 02:00:30,032
- He could've got electrocuted.
- Oh, no.

1754
02:00:30,056 --> 02:00:31,690
- What, he break it?
- What are you talking about?

1755
02:00:31,691 --> 02:00:33,015
You're thinking of toasters.

1756
02:00:33,101 --> 02:00:35,718
You can't get electrocuted
from the TV set.

1757
02:00:35,812 --> 02:00:37,594
She's not thinking
about a toaster.

1758
02:00:37,595 --> 02:00:38,930
She's thinking about a TV.

1759
02:00:39,023 --> 02:00:40,980
Is he taking it into the bathtub?

1760
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:46,562
You're not gonna get electrocuted.

1761
02:00:51,661 --> 02:00:52,993
Charlie.

1762
02:00:53,079 --> 02:00:55,196
Hey, Lip. Johnny invited me.

1763
02:00:55,707 --> 02:00:57,289
Oh. Well, come on in.

1764
02:00:57,375 --> 02:00:59,992
All right. Oh. You remember Marie?

1765
02:01:00,086 --> 02:01:02,624
- Hey, Marie.
- Charlie, you actually came?

1766
02:01:02,714 --> 02:01:05,001
I was kidding.

1767
02:01:05,091 --> 02:01:06,798
With the wife, too? Jeez.

1768
02:01:06,885 --> 02:01:08,842

1769
02:01:08,928 --> 02:01:10,362
- Hello. What a surprise.

1770
02:01:10,363 --> 02:01:11,570
Nice to see you.

1771
02:01:11,931 --> 02:01:13,242
Everybody, Charlie

1772
02:01:13,266 --> 02:01:14,744
- Hey.
- Didn't bring nothing.

1773
02:01:14,768 --> 02:01:16,602

- Sit down, sit down.

1775
02:01:24,611 --> 02:01:25,692
Doc.

1776
02:01:28,406 --> 02:01:30,272
Ah. Welcome.

1777
02:01:31,034 --> 02:01:32,034
Oh.

1778
02:01:33,453 --> 02:01:35,786
Hey, everybody.

1779
02:01:36,372 --> 02:01:37,533
Stop it, stop it.

1780
02:01:37,624 --> 02:01:39,584
This is Dr Donald Shirley.

1781
02:01:42,295 --> 02:01:43,376
Merry Christmas.

1782
02:01:47,467 --> 02:01:50,335
Well, come on. Make some
room. Get this man a plate.

1783
02:01:56,309 --> 02:01:57,309
Oh.

1784
02:01:59,479 --> 02:02:01,721
- Hello.
- You must be Dolores.

1785
02:02:02,649 --> 02:02:03,730
Welcome.

1786
02:02:03,817 --> 02:02:05,809
Buon Natale.

1787
02:02:07,362 --> 02:02:09,479
Thank you for sharing
your husband with me.

1788
02:02:16,496 --> 02:02:18,988
Thank you for helping
him with the letters.
