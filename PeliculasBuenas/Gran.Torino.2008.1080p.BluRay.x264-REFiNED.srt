00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,100
<i>This Eastwood's first starring role
since 2004's Million Dollar Baby.</i>

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:08,110
<i>Gran Torino was recognized
by the American Film Institute</i>

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:11,120
<i>as one of the Ten Best Films of 2008.</i>

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:15,130
<i>Clint Eastwood won an award for Best Actor
from the National Board of Review,</i>

5
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,140
<i>he was nominated
for the Broadcast Film Critics Association</i>

6
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:23,150
<i>and by the
Chicago Film Critics Association Awards</i>

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,160
<i>for Best Actor.</i>

8
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:29,170
<i>In 2010, the film was named</i>

9
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,180
<i>Best Foreign Film
at the César Awards in France.</i>

10
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,820
I'm real sorry about Dorothy, Walt.

11
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,580
She was a real peach.

12
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,990
Thanks for coming, Al.

13
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,340
Father, Son, Holy Spirit.

14
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,170
Father. Spirit.

15
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,520
Uh.

16
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,260
Holy Spirit.

17
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,220
<i>« It's okay, I can move down. »</i>

18
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,990
Spectacles, testicles, wallet, and watch.

19
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,200
Look at the way the old man
glared at Ashley.

20
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,290
Can't even tone it down
for Mom's funeral.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,090
What do you expect?
Dad's still living in the '50s.

22
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,040
He expects his granddaughter
to dress a little more modestly.

23
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,540
Well, your kid's wearing a Lions jersey.
I'm sure Dad appreciates that.

24
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,760
The point is that there's nothing anyone
can do that won't disappoint the old man.

25
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,140
It's inevitable.

26
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,310
You know, that's why we stopped
doing Thanksgivings.

27
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,885
You know, that deal with the boat motor,

28
00:02:29,896 --> 00:02:32,710
the broken birdbath.
It's always something.

29
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,280
What are we gonna do with him?

30
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,730
Don't you think he's gonna get in trouble,
all by himself in the old neighborhood?

31
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,610
Well, why don't you have him
move in with you?

32
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,460
Ha, ha, ha.

33
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,540
Hey. Shh.

34
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,980
Death is often a bittersweet occasion
to us Catholics.

35
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:16,520
<i>« Bitter in the pain,
sweet in the salvation. »</i>

36
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:22,820
Bitter in the pain it causes the deceased
and their families.

37
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,880
<i>« Sweet to those of us
who know the salvation that awaits.</i>

38
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,790
And some may ask, "What is death?"

39
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,470
<i>« "Is it the end?" »</i>

40
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,880
"Or is it the beginning?"

41
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,630
"And what is life?
What is this thing we call life?"

42
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:46,765
<i>« All these questions can frustrate you. »</i>

43
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:47,975
Ashley, stop it.

44
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,560
<i>« That's why you have
to turn to the Lord. »</i>

45
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,820
Jesus.

46
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,490
<i>« Because the Lord is the sweetness... »</i>

47
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,070
- This is so good.
- Did you have a chance to call Martha?

48
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,500
<i>FarangSiam thanks you. Enjoy!</i>

49
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,550
- Is that Dad?
- No. That's Grandpa Walt.

50
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:19,090
"Third platoon, E company,
March 2nd, 1952, Korea"?

51
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,050
Where's Korea?

52
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,760
A lot of people showed up
after the service.

53
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,760
Well, I suppose they heard
there's gonna be a lot of ham.

54
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,220
I'll go down in the basement
and get some chairs.

55
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,430
- Oh, I can do that, Dad.
- No, I need them now, not next week.

56
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,860
Cool, I found a medal. Look at this.

57
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,310
How much longer do we have to stay?

58
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:11,390
This ghetto is a dead zone for my cell,
and I'm bored.

59
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,270
Ashley, why don't you go
help Grandpa Walt with the chairs?

60
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,180
- Me?
- Yes, you. Go. Go help him.

61
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,980
Grandpa Walt,
would you like some help with this?

62
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,270
With your chairs?

63
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,650
No. You probably just painted your nails.

64
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,120
Honey, come here.
Okay, well, your dad is driving me crazy.

65
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:39,080
- Why did you make me do that?
- It's okay. We're leaving soon.

66
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,920
Hey, girl. Come on.

67
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,510
Come on. Come on.

68
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,880
Come with me.

69
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:16,000
How many swamp rats can you get
in one room?

70
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:37,310
Wow. Grandpa,
when did you get the vintage car?

71
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,760
1972.

72
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,440
I never knew you had a cool old car.

73
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:52,070
Yeah. Well, it's been here
since before you were born.

74
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,740
So...

75
00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:00,500
...what are you gonna do with it
when you, like, die?

76
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,300
What about that super-cool
retro couch you have in the den?

77
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,310
Because I'm going to state next year...

78
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,643
...and it would look really good
in my room,

79
00:07:14,654 --> 00:07:16,730
and I don't have any furniture at all.

80
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,610
Oh, God.

81
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,570
- Who are you?
- Hi.
- What do you want?

82
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,654
- I live...
- Get the shit out of your mouth.

83
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,110
- Tell me what you want.
- Do you have jumper cables?

84
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,830
- My uncle's car is old and...
- We don't have any cables.

85
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,130
And have some respect, zipper-head.
We're in mourning here.

86
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,300
- How you holding up, Walt?
- Mr. Kowalski.

87
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,920
Huh?

88
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,130
Mr. Kowalski, that's my name.

89
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,590
Right. Mr. Kowalski.

90
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,430
Your wife and I became quite close
these last few months.

91
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,430
She asked that I watch over you
when she passed on.

92
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,270
I told her I watch over my flock.

93
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,150
But she made me promise I'd keep
an extra-sharp eye on you.

94
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:08,940
Look, I appreciate the kindness
you've shown to my wife.

95
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,770
Now that you've spoken your piece...

96
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,650
...why don't you go tend
to some of your other sheep?

97
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,320
Okay?

98
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:20,080
Dorothy mentioned specifically that it was
her desire for you to go to confession.

99
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,750
She said she couldn't remember
the last time you went.

100
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,330
- Is that so?
- It is.

101
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,630
Well, I confess that I never really
cared for church very much.

102
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,850
The only reason I went
was because of her.

103
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,850
And I confess that I have no desire...

104
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:37,180
...to confess to a boy
that's just out of the seminary.

105
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,160
Great to see you.

106
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,758
- Bye, dear.
- So long, Walt.

107
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,370
- Walt, can you get it started?
- Yeah, it'll be fine.

108
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:14,170
I wish I could help, Dad,
but I gotta get the kids home.

109
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,850
- Kids are getting restless.
- Yeah, fine. Just go.

110
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,720
I'll call you,
see how you're doing.

111
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:20,970
All right.

112
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:27,830
Kill you to buy American?

113
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,240
Jesus.

114
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,620
Did you see the way
he looked at the truck?

115
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,370
It's always rice-burner this,
Jap-burner that, you know?

116
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,420
Even at Mom's funeral,
he can't let it go.

117
00:09:37,431 --> 00:09:38,660
He didn't say anything.

118
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,660
- He didn't need to.
- What do you expect?

119
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,710
The man worked at Ford
all those years.

120
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,330
- I suppose that's my goddamn fault.
- Just give it a rest, just drive, okay?

121
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:50,750
Kids, want the radio on?
Anyone wanna listen to some music? Good.

122
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,680
Damn barbarians.

123
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,700
I'm just so brokenhearted.

124
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,650
I want my daughter
to find another husband.

125
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,150
If she married again
there would be a man in the house.

126
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,830
What about Thao?
The man of the house is right there.

127
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,290
<i>« Look at him washing dishes. »</i>

128
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,550
He does whatever his sister
orders him to do.

129
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,460
<i>« How could he ever become
the man of the house? »</i>

130
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:41,130
Be patient, once he's older,
he will be the man of the house.

131
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,590
No way.

132
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:54,760
Today is a blessed day,
for a child is born.

133
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,860
I offer food to nurture this child's body.

134
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,160
I offer clothing
to protect this child's flesh.

135
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:08,370
The child is blessed with a mother
and father.

136
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,420
Oh, spirit of this child...

137
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,010
...return home
and do not wander anymore.

138
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,680
Come home, spirit and soul, come home.

139
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:36,150
Live a good life and grow old.

140
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:53,510
Jesus. Polarski would roll over
in his grave if he could see his lawn now.

141
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,380
What the hell did Chinks have to
move into this neighborhood for?

142
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,380
Why does that old white man stay here?

143
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,110
All the Americans have moved out
of this neighborhood.

144
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,390
Why haven't you gone?

145
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,310
Why don't you strut away,
you dumb rooster?

146
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:29,370
Are you gone completely deaf
or something?

147
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,910
Hi there, Walt.

148
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,040
I'm not a friend of yours,
so why do you insist on calling me Walt?

149
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,750
Sorry. Mr. Kowalski.

150
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,663
What are you peddling today, <i>< Padre ></i>?
<i>[ Father ]</i>

151
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:44,830
Nothing.
I thought I'd drop by and see you.

152
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,470
I haven't seen you in church.

153
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:50,110
Now that you've done your good deed,
why don't you take off down the road?

154
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:54,110
- I'd really like to talk, Mr. Kowalski.
- Not in this lifetime, sonny.

155
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,730
Why? Do you have a problem with me,
Mr. Kowalski?

156
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,110
- You don't wanna know.
- No, I do.

157
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,620
Well, I think you're an over-educated
27-year-old virgin...

158
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,016
...who likes to hold hands of ladies

159
00:13:06,027 --> 00:13:09,290
who are superstitious
and promises them eternity.

160
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,130
Yo! Hey!

161
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,583
Is you...?
Is you a boy or is you a girl, man?

162
00:13:29,594 --> 00:13:30,850
I can't tell.

163
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:33,220
Hey, chinito, hey,
if you was in the pen...

164
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,810
...I'd be fucking you in the ass.
You'd be my bitch.

165
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,240
What are you reading,
"Jackass and the Rice Stalk"?

166
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,490
Yeah, that's right, keep walking!
Keep walking!

167
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,400
Look at me when I talk to you, homes!

168
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:45,980
Fucking slopes, man,
everywhere you look, man.

169
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,950
- Slopes everywhere we go, man.
- Go back to your rice paddy.

170
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:52,070
What you looking at, man?

171
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,680
- That's my little cousin over there.
- You sure that's your cousin, man?

172
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,720
- Fuck, yeah, that's my little cousin.
- He tight with anybody?

173
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,170
No, he flies solo, man.
You wanna do something?

174
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:10,550
Man, let's go down there and see
what the fuck they doing over there.

175
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,980
I like your sandals too.

176
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,150
- Hey. Yo, what's up? What's up?
- Yo, what's up, motherfuckers?

177
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,120
They fucking with you?
Man, fuck you, homeboy!

178
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,450
- What you got?
- Hey, we can do this right now.

179
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,280
- You go fucking back to your country.
- Fuck you, man.

180
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,820
Oh, good, more fucking rice niggers.

181
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,370
Aren't you supposed to cook me
some Chinese food, huh?

182
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,960
- How many bullets you got?
- We'll catch you on the rebound, homey.

183
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,400
- Thao!
- Come on, man. Get in the car, man.

184
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,260
Thao.

- Get with us, man.
- Get in the car.

- Fuck, man, get in the car, man.
- Thao!

187

Spider?
Is that what he just called you, Fong?

212

Spider.

213

- Is there something wrong with Spider?
- What are you doing here?

214

Hey, so how old is you anyways?

215

- Mentally, I'm way too old for you.
- What?

216
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,240
You guys are stupid. I'm going inside.

Come on, chill with us.

223
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,730
You need somebody to protect you.
That's what your big coz is for.

224

Look, dog, I been there, done it,
and I seen it, man.

225
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,900
Back in the day, everybody used to
wanna beat me up.

226
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,680
But now, nobody wanna fuck with me.

227

- That's woman's work, man.

232
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,370
Don't get your hands dirty, man.

233
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:28,540
So, what do I have to do?

234
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,290
Spider told me that our boy next door
got a bad-ass whip.

235
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,880
Come on.

236
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,300
Nice.

237
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,760
Yeah, my little cousin being a little man.

238
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,940
Whoa.

239
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,360
Yo, now, that's a nice car.

240
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:59,400
Hell, yeah. 1972 Gran Torino, Fastback.

241
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,450
- Yo.
- Cobra jet engine.

242
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,630
Yo, man, it's still in mint condition.

243
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:08,340
Yo, man. It's in mint condition, man.

244
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,830
Oh, I've got one.

245
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,380
There's a Mexican, a Jew,
and a colored guy go into a bar.

246
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:19,630
The bartender looks up and says,
"Get the fuck out of here".

247
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,970
So here's where my flock congregates
when they're not in church.

248
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,180
Hey, Father J.

249
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,810
Hi, Mel. Hey there, Darrell.

250
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,190
- Hello, Father.
- Hi, Walt.

251
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,850
What brings you in here, Father?
The meat raffle?

252
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,940
No, I just came down to talk to Walt,
if that's okay.

253
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:43,700
Damn, <i>< Padre ></i>, you are persistent,
aren't you?

254
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,780
I promised your wife.

255
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,380
All right. Let's get a booth.

256
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,920
I'll have a Pabst and a shot of Jack
and whatever he's having.

257
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,190
I'll have a Diet Coke.

258
00:18:58,201 --> 00:19:00,600
Bullshit, this is a bar.
You have a drink.

259
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,890
- Um, I'll have a gin and tonic.
- Attaboy!

260
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,810
So...

261
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,970
...what do you want?

262
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,980
I promised your wife I'd get you
to go to confession.

263
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,780
Now, why would you do that?

264
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,270
She was very insistent. She made me.

265
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,360
You're kind of fond of promising things
you can't deliver on. Right, Father?

266
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,860
- Let's talk about something else.
- What?

267
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,570
Life and death.

268
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:31,790
Life and death. What the hell do you know
about life and death?

269
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,640
I'd like to think I know a lot.
I'm a priest.

270
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,800
Yeah. You get up and preach about life
and death...

271
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,770
...but all you know is what you learned
in priest school.

272
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,060
Right out of the rookie
preacher's handbook.

273
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,180
I don't know about that. I think...

274
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,220
Death is bittersweet.

275
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,980
Sort of bitter in its pain,
but sweet in its salvation.

276
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,660
That's what you know about life and death,
and it's pathetic.

277
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,280
What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?

278
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,123
I know a lot.

279
00:20:01,134 --> 00:20:04,290
I lived for almost three years
in Korea with it.

280
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,160
Thanks.

281
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,490
We shot men...

282
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:15,040
...stabbed them with bayonets,
hacked 17-year-old to death with shovels.

283
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,880
Stuff I'll remember till the day I die.

284
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:23,810
Horrible things,
but things I'll live with.

285
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,840
And what about life?

286
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:35,230
Well, I survived the war.

287
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,490
Got married, had a family.

288
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,820
Sounds like you know a lot more
about death than you do living.

289
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,410
Maybe so, Father.

290
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,660
<i>« Maybe so. »</i>

Morning? It's after 1 in the afternoon,
it's not morning.

298
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,100
Oh, right. Afternoon, then.

Well, I don't know.

302

00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:41,280
What the hell is this?

334
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Get up.

335
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,150
Get off my lawn.

336
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,170
Listen, old man,
you don't wanna fuck with me.

337
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,180
Did you hear me?
I said, get off my lawn now.

338
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,340
Are you fucking crazy?
Go back in the house.

339
00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:00,010
Yeah. I blow a hole in your face,
and then I go in the house.

340
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:03,220
And I sleep like a baby.
You can count on that.

341
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:06,390
We used to stack fucks like you
five feet high in Korea...

342
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,640
...use you for sandbags.

343
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,190
Okay.

344
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:19,240
- But you better watch your back.
- Fuck it, man, he's crazy.

345
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,470
<i>« We'll get this cracker next time. »</i>

346
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,260
Thank you.

347
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,180
Get off my lawn.

348
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,790
What the hell is this?

349
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,300
Christ.

350
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:27,720
No, no. No, no, no.
Come on, no more. No more.

351
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,770
No more. What...?

352
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,980
Stay right there... Stay right there.

353
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,730
Why can't you just leave me alone?

354
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,650
We brought you some shallots
to plant.

355
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,650
- I don't want them.
- They're perennials.

356
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,978
They come back every year.

357
00:27:41,989 --> 00:27:44,080
Why are you bringing me
all this garbage?

358
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,910
Because...

359
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:49,740
- Because you saved Thao.
- I didn't save anybody.

360
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:50,785
I just...

361
00:27:50,796 --> 00:27:53,420
I kept a bunch of jabbering gooks
off of my lawn, that's all.

362
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,885
- You're a hero to the neighborhood.
- I'm not a hero.

363
00:27:55,895 --> 00:27:58,500
They think you are.
That's why they keep bringing you gifts.

364
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:00,236
- Please, take them.
- They're wrong.

365
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,254
Now, I just want to be left alone.
Thank you.

366
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,550
Wait.

367
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,860
This is my mom, Vu, I'm Sue,
and that's my brother, Thao.

368
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,530
- We live next door.
- So?

369
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:15,030
Thao wants to say something.

370
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,980
I'm sorry.

371
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:23,650
- Sorry for what?
- For trying to steal your car.

372
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,540
Let me tell you something, boy.

373
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,990
You step on this property again,
you're done.

374
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,610
Good afternoon, Walt.

375
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,910
I told you I'm not going to confession.

376
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:03,580
- Why didn't you just call the police?
- What?

377
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,580
I do work
with some of the Hmong gangs...

378
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,200
...and I heard there was trouble
in the neighborhood.

379
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,420
Why didn't you call the police?

380
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,040
Well...

381
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:18,080
You know, I prayed
that they would show up...

382
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:21,040
...but nobody answered.

383
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,800
What were you thinking?

384
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:26,350
Someone could have been killed.
We're talking life and death here.

385
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,100
When things go wrong,
you gotta act quickly.

386
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:34,220
When we were in Korea and a thousand
screaming gooks came across our line...

387
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,270
...we didn't call the police, we reacted.

388
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,110
We're not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski.

389
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:43,820
I've been thinking about our conversation
on life and death.

390
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,790
About what you said.

391
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,130
About how you carry around

392
00:29:47,141 --> 00:29:49,590
all the horrible things
you were forced to do...

393
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,910
...horrible things that won't leave you.

394
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:57,540
It seems it would do you good
to unload some of that burden.

395
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,630
Things done during war are terrible.

396
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,760
Being ordered to kill.

397
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,800
Killing to save yourself,
killing to save others.

398
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:10,350
You're right.
Those are things I know nothing about...

399
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:13,050
...but I do know about forgiveness...

400
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:16,560
...and I've seen a lot of men
who have confessed their sins...

401
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:20,990
...admitted their guilt,
and left their burdens behind them.

402
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:23,480
Stronger men than you.

403
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,530
Men at war who were ordered
to do appalling things...

404
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,160
...and are now at peace.

405
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,860
Well, I gotta hand it to you, <i>< Padre ></i>.

406
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,160
You came here
with your guns loaded this time.

407
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,340
Thank you.

408
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,590
And you're right about one thing.

409
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:42,420
About stronger men than me
reaching their salvation.

410
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:45,680
Well, "Halle-fucking-lujah".

411
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,670
But you're wrong about something else.

412
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,220
What's that, Mr. Kowalski?

413
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:57,010
The thing that haunts a man the most
is what he isn't ordered to do.

414
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,070
There.
You finally look like a human being again.

415
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,530
You shouldn't wait so long between
haircuts, you cheap son of a bitch.

416
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,790
Yeah. Well, I'm surprised
you're still around.

417
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,410
I was always hoping you'd die...

418
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,210
...and they'd get somebody
who knew what they were doing.

419
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:19,700
Instead you just keep hanging around
like the doo-wop dago you are.

420
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:24,000
- That'll be 10 bucks, Walt.
- Ten bucks? Jesus Christ, Martin.

421
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:27,210
What are you, half Jew or something?
You keep raising the prices.

422
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,489
It's been 10 bucks for
the last five years,

423
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,560
you hard-nosed, Polack son of a bitch.

424
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,720
- Yeah, well, keep the change.
- See you in three weeks, prick.

425
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:38,220
Not if I see you first, dipshit.

426
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,650
Since everything could go downhill
after that.

427
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,570
- Yeah, that's true.
- That would suck.

428
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,750
- That's cool, you know? Yeah.
<i>« - Ain't shit going on, man. »</i>

429
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,360
<i>« Ain't shit going on. »</i>

430
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,660
Man, look at this. Look at this, Monk.
Check this out.

431
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,860
<i>« - Oooh. Boy.
- Oh, yeah. »</i>

432
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:05,040
Bring that little tight ass over here.
Come here, girl. Don't be shy.

433
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:09,420
What, you can't say hi?
Why you acting all stuck-up and shit?

434
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,590
- What you supposed to be, man?
- Yo, it's cool, dog.

435
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,760
What the fuck you doing
in my neighborhood, boy?

436
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:21,470
Nothing. Just going down to Corner Spot,
you know? Get some CDs.

437
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,680
It's all good, bro.

438
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,890
See, he called you bro, Duke.

439
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,230
- He called you bro, man.
- It's all good, bro.

440
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,150
- It's all good, huh?
- Shut the fuck up.

441
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:32,200
Call me bro again, man,
I'll bite your motherfucking face off.

442
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,610
Yeah, motherfucker.

443
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,950
Now, what the fuck
y'all come down here for?

444
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,750
You here to bring me this little present?
Monk? She bringing it to us?

445
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,580
This little Oriental yummy.

446
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,090
Don't worry.
I'm gonna take real good care of her.

447
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,620
- Fuck out of here, man.
- Fuck out of here, man.

448
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,920
- I told you we're finished here.
- Oh, yeah.

449
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,380
Keep your ass right here.

450
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:00,390
Oh, great. Another asshole
who has a fetish for Asian girls?

451
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,940
God, that gets so old.

452
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,770
- Oh, shit.
- What's your name, girl?

453
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,780
My name?

454
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,770
Get your ass out of here, okay?

455
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,940
It's "Take your crude come-on
to every woman who walks past..."

456
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:14,230
"...and cram it." That's my name.

457
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,820
<i>« Mouthy little bitch. »</i>

458
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:20,280
- Who you think you talking to?
- Who does it look like?

459
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:23,870
- You think you real funny, don't you?
- Oh, shit. Ain't she tough?

460
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,369
What? You gonna hit me now?

461
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,840
That would pretty much
complete the picture.

462
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,830
You need to keep your bitch on a leash.

463
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,670
Put a chain on that whore
and yank that motherfucker.

464
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,960
Of course.
Right to the stereotype thesaurus.

465
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:37,510
Call me a whore and a bitch
in the same sentence.

466
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,730
- This bitch is crazy.
- I like them like that.

467
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,010
Man, take this bitch.

468
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:43,130
<i>« Hey. Get off me. »</i>

469
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,310
- You don't know when to quit, do you?
- I'm gonna teach her a lesson.

470
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,520
Stop. Let go.

471
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,040
Get your ass over there.

472
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,210
What the fuck you looking at, old man?

473
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:08,620
- What the hell are you spooks up to?
- Spooks?

474
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:12,294
You better get your ass on,
honky, while I still let you.
<i>[ white person ]</i>

475
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,600
- That's what you better do.
- That's right, bitch.

476
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:17,380
Fuck you think you at?

477
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:30,390
Ever notice how you come across somebody
once in a while...

478
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,400
...that you shouldn't have fucked with?

479
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,070
That's me.

480
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,910
Man, you fucking crazy, man.
Get out of here, man.

481
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,909
Why don't you get your ass up out of here

482
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,010
before I kick your old,
wrinkly, white ass?

483
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,910
Crazy motherfucker, man.
What's wrong with him, man?

484
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,040
What the fuck?

485
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:58,600
- This motherfucker crazy, man.
- What's wrong with this nigga, man?

486
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,300
What the hell?

487
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,590
Get in the truck.

488
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,650
This crazy motherfucker, man.
What's wrong with him, man?

489
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:09,600
He put his finger at us.

490
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:12,600
- Oh, shit.
- Come on, now. Hey, pops. Come on, now.

491
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:15,190
Shut your fucking face.

492
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,780
You fucking don't listen, do you?

493
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,240
Now, get in the truck.

494
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,500
- Go on, get in the truck now. Shit.
<i>« - Way to go, old man. »</i>

495
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,080
Shut up, pussy.

496
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,920
What is all this "bro" shit, anyway?

497
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,580
Want to be Super Spade or something?
These guys don't want to be your bro...

498
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,050
...and I don't blame them.
Now, get your ofay,

499
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,380
<i>« Paddy ass on down the road. »</i>

500
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,970
Take care, now.

501
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:50,970
Yeah, you too.

502
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,230
Oh, yeah.

503
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,200
Fuck, man, why y'all
didn't fucking do nothing?

504
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,660
- Man, kick that nigga's ass.
- Man, you fucking...

505
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,120
Shit, man.

506
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,710
This fucker.
He had that cannon in your fucking face.

507
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,010
- You didn't do nothing.
- Trying to stay out.

508
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,760
What's the matter with you, for chrissake?

509
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,060
Trying to get yourself killed?

510
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,970
I thought you Asian girls
were supposed to be smart.

511
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:30,970
Hanging around a neighborhood like that's
a fast way to get you in the obituaries.

512
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,390
I know. I know. Take it easy.

513
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,270
And what about that goofball guy
you were with?

514
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,860
Is that a date or something?

515
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:42,190
Yeah. Kind of. His name is Trey.

516
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,440
Well, you shouldn't be hanging out
with him.

517
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:47,700
You should be hanging out with your
own people, with other "Humong".

518
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:51,710
You mean Hmong?
We're Hmong, not "Humong".

519
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,660
Whatever.

520
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,760
Where the hell is "Humong",
I mean Hmong, anyway?

521
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,790
Wow.

522
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,590
You're so enlightened, you know that?
No, Hmong isn't a place. It's a people.

523
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,890
Hmong people come from different parts
of Laos, Thailand, and China.

524
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,940
Yeah. Well, how did you end up
in my neighborhood, then?

525
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:14,020
Why didn't you stay there?

526
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:17,690
It's a Vietnam thing.
We fought on your side.

527
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,193
And when the Americans quit,

528
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:21,630
the Communists started killing
all the Hmong.

529
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,580
So we came over here.

530
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:27,500
Yeah. Well, I don't know
how you ended up in the Midwest.

531
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,420
There's snow on the ground
six months out of the year.

532
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:34,050
Why does a jungle people want to
be in the great frozen tundra?

533
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:39,380
Hill people. We were hill people.
Not jungle people. Booga-booga-booga.

534
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,960
Yeah. Whatever.

535
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,670
Blame the Lutherans.
They brought us over here.

536
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,970
Everybody blames the Lutherans.

537
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:52,890
Well, you'd think the cold
would keep all the idiots out.

538
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,930
Thanks for the ride.

539
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:59,740
You know something, kid?
You're all right.

540
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:02,690
But what about that dimwit brother
of yours?

541
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:06,820
- He a little slow or something?
- Thao is actually really smart.

542
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:09,450
He just doesn't know
which direction to go in.

543
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:14,160
- Yeah. Poor Toad.
- It's really common.

544
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:16,120
Hmong girls over here fit in better.

545
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:19,460
The girls go to college,
and the boys go to jail.

546
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,290
Yeah.

547
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:37,070
That old hag hates my ass.

548
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,520
Well...

549
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:49,110
"Your birthday today." Daisy.

550
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:53,990
"This year, you have to make a choice
between two life paths."

551
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,080
"Second chances come your way."

552
00:38:56,250 --> 00:39:01,340
"Extraordinary events culminate
in what might seem to be an anticlimax."

553
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,340
"Your lucky numbers are 84, 23..."

554
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:10,180
"... 11, 78, and 99."

555
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:13,310
What a load of shit.

556
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,470
Yeah.

557
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:34,200
What the hell is it with kids nowadays?

558
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,530
All right.

559
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,600
<i>« Hey, Mrs. V.
Here, let me help you with those. »</i>

560
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:44,540
- Oh, thank you. I just...
- I got it.

561
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,550
How about that?

562
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:49,210
Here you go.

563
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,280
How about that, Daisy?

564
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,390
Yeah, I got it.

565
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:03,190
That was too heavy for the bag.

566
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:04,900
- No problem.
- Thank you.

567
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,620
- Go ahead, Karen, give it to him.
- Here you go.

568
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:23,000
- Well, what is it?
- It's a Gopher.

569
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:27,090
So you can reach stuff.
You know, it makes things a lot easier.

570
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,100
This is from me.

571
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,710
It's a phone.

572
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:36,940
- Oh, I can see that.
- I just thought...

573
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,360
Well, we thought
that it would make things easier.

574
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:41,520
Well, thank you, Karen.

575
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,600
There's nothing wrong with making things
less hard on yourself.

576
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:47,270
Karen's right, Dad. You've worked hard
your whole life.

577
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,611
Maybe it's time
you started thinking about,

578
00:40:49,622 --> 00:40:51,200
you know, taking it easier.

579
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,785
Jeez. That's another thing, Dad.

580
00:40:53,796 --> 00:40:56,120
You really should get rid
of the coffin nails.

581
00:40:57,370 --> 00:41:00,000
But, I don't know, we were thinking
about the house.

582
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,421
You know, what with Mom gone,

583
00:41:01,431 --> 00:41:03,344
it's gotta be a lot to maintain
around here.

584
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,960
- Mm-hm.
- Let alone clean.

585
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:08,300
And, I don't know, you're here all alone.

586
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:10,621
Yeah, and there are
these great places now,

587
00:41:10,632 --> 00:41:12,350
you know, these communities...

588
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:16,600
...where you don't have to worry
about mowing the lawn or shoveling snow...

589
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,760
...where the people are like you,
active and alert, but are alone...

590
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:24,640
...and would benefit from being
around folks their own age.

591
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:28,270
Yeah, Dad, look. You gotta check it out.
We've brought some brochures.

592
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,060
These places are nothing like
what you'd think they'd be.

593
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:33,020
- They're great.
- No, no, beautiful.

594
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:38,660
They're really nice. They really are.
These are top-notch, like, resorts.

595
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,743
It's like staying in a hotel practically.

596
00:41:40,754 --> 00:41:41,800
They're beautiful.

597
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,120
- They really are.
- Yeah.

598
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:47,120
They take care of everything.
They'll clean up. They're really nice.

599
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:49,540
They have wonderful stores.
You can buy new shoes.

600
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:52,590
- They're amazing. They really are.
- You'd have a good time.

601
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,640
- Play some golf, maybe.
- Meet other people.

602
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,890
Son of a bitch.
Kicking us out on his birthday.

603
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,690
How about that, Daisy?

604
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:07,060
- He won't let anybody help him.
- Well, we tried. Can we just drop it?

605
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,980
No one can say we didn't try.

606
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:11,490
The hell with him.
You know what we should've done?

607
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:13,730
We should've stayed home
with Josh and Ashley.

608
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,030
At least they were smart enough
to not come.

609
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,710
Goddamn kids have more sense
than we do.

610
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:22,460
We miss Mama, don't we, Daisy?

611
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:24,170
Yeah.

612
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,500
Yeah.

613
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:43,800
<i>« Hey, Walt. »</i>

614
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:45,890
What are you up to?

615
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,890
We're having a barbecue.
You wanna come over?

616
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:53,060
- What do you think?
- There's tons of food.

617
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,860
Yeah. Just keep your hands off my dog.

618
00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:00,570
- No worries. We only eat cats.
- Really?

619
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:04,410
No, I'm kidding, you moron.
Come on, you can be my special guest.

620
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:07,210
No, I'm fine right here.

621
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,580
Yeah.

622
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,423
Son of a bitch.

623
00:43:12,434 --> 00:43:15,440
Okay, so, what have you had to eat today?

624
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:21,600
Oh, I had a piece of cake
and a little beef jerky.

625
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,440
Come on over and get something to eat.
We've got beer too.

626
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:34,230
Well, I might as well drink with strangers
rather than drink alone.

627
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,650
After all, it is my birthday.

628
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:41,780
- Really? Happy birthday, Wally.
- Don't call me Wally.

629
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:51,630
Well, no Pabst, but plenty of beer.

630
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:56,540
- As they say, when in "Humong".
- Ha, ha. Hey, what am I doing wrong?

631
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:59,300
Every time I look at somebody,
they look at the ground.

632
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,310
You're fine.

633
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,980
- What's she saying?
- She said welcome to her home.

634
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,560
- Oh, no, she's not.
- Yeah, no, she didn't.

635
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:15,480
- She hates me. Come on.
- Yeah, she hates you.

636
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:18,520
Okay. Hey.

637
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:27,630
Hey, what are all you fish heads
looking at anyway?

638
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:32,620
I think we should go
into the other room. Sorry.

639
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:39,670
A lot of people in this house
are very traditional.

640
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,760
Number one, never touch a Hmong person
on their head, not even a child.

641
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:48,350
Hmong people believe that the soul
resides on the head, so don't do that.

642
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:50,510
Well, sounds dumb, but fine.

643
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:52,794
Yeah, and a lot of Hmong people consider

644
00:44:52,805 --> 00:44:55,280
looking someone in the eye
to be very rude.

645
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,150
That's why they look away
when you look at them.

646
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,870
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

647
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:04,580
Some Hmong people tend to smile or grin
when they're yelled at.

648
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:09,280
It's a cultural thing.
It expresses embarrassment or insecurity.

649
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:11,700
It's not that they're laughing at you
or anything.

650
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:14,620
Yeah. God, you people are nuts.

651
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,880
But the food does look good.
Smells good too.

652
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:23,220
Well, of course. It's Hmong food.

653
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:27,840
Yeah. Okay.
Can I come back for seconds?

654
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:37,890
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

655
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:40,310
You know, you mentioned
about looking at people.

656
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,637
He's been staring at me
the whole evening.

657
00:45:42,648 --> 00:45:43,700
That's Kor Khue.

658
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,240
He's the Lor family shaman.

659
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,200
And what's that, some sort
of a witch doctor or something?

660
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:50,420
- Something like that.
- Yeah. Booga-booga.

661
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,590
Ha, ha. Very funny, Wally.

662
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,090
Kor Khue's interested in you.
He heard what you did.

663
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:14,140
He would like to read you.
It'd be rude not to allow him this.

664
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:16,020
It's a great honor.

665
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:21,320
- Yeah, sure, fine by me. Sure.
- All right. Take a seat.

666
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,780
Here?

667
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:42,300
He says that people do not respect you.
They don't even wanna look at you.

668
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,090
He says the way you live,
your food has no flavor.

669
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:53,510
You're worried about your life.

670
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:04,980
You made a mistake in your past life,
like a mistake that you did...

671
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:07,320
...you're not satisfied with.

672
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,342
He says you have no happiness
in your life.

673
00:47:15,353 --> 00:47:17,350
It's like you're not at peace.

674
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:44,690
Are you all right?

675
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:49,980
Yeah, I'm... Yeah, I'm fine.

676
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:53,530
Fine. I'm fine.

677
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,980
God, I've got more in common
with these gooks...

678
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:19,140
...than I do my own spoilt rotten family.

679
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:21,720
Jesus Christ.

680
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:26,560
Happy birthday.

681
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:31,900
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

682
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:34,240
You were bleeding.

683
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:38,460
No, I bit my tongue. It's nothing.

684
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:41,080
Why don't we go
and get some of that good gook food?

685
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:44,340
- You know, I'm starving.
- Okay.

686
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,270
Fantastic. Well, you ladies are wonderful.

687
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:56,100
This stuff is really good.

688
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,530
Come on, you glutton.

689
00:49:05,690 --> 00:49:07,400
- What's up?
- Let's go.

690
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:10,770
- What for?
- To mingle.

691
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:13,070
Mingle? We're mingling right here.

692
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,460
Come on.
You told me not to leave you alone.

693
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:23,950
Thank you very much, but I have to go now.
I have to go now.

694
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,930
I'll be back.
Now, don't let anything go away.

695
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:38,840
Oh, great.

696
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:41,720
Well, well, well. Look who's over there.

697
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:44,970
- Yeah, the kid who stole my Gran Torino.
- My brother, Thao.

698
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:49,230
Tried to, anyway. Yeah. Yeah, Toad.

699
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:22,510
It was a little wobbly,
but that should fix it.

700
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:35,320
<i>« So where are you guys from? »</i>

701
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,700
- I'm not far from here.
- I'm from Texas.

702
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:57,340
- What's this?
- A little rice liquor. Here, try it.

703
00:50:57,510 --> 00:50:58,800
All right.

704
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:25,910
My friends and I were just wondering
what you're doing here.

705
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:29,160
Well, that's a good question.
What am I doing here?

706
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:32,510
- Name's Walt.
- Hi, Walt. I'm Youa.

707
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:36,380
- Yuam. A pleasure.
- No. Youa.

708
00:51:37,050 --> 00:51:38,560
Youa, okay.

709
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,930
So, what do you do?

710
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:45,180
- Oh, I fix things, stuff like that.
- Like what?

711
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:50,860
Well, I just fixed that dryer there,
I fixed my wife's friend's sink...

712
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:53,751
...and I took old Aunt Mary
to the doctor's

713
00:51:53,762 --> 00:51:56,120
to get her prescription fixed up.

714
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:00,620
And then I even fixed a door
that hadn't even broken yet.

715
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:02,610
You're funny.

716
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:05,280
I've been called a lot of things,
but never funny.

717
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:09,137
Well, I'm gonna take off. Enjoy yourself.

718
00:52:09,148 --> 00:52:11,430
Okay. Yum Yum. Pleasure.

719
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,840
Look, she's going, man. Come on.

720
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:21,670
<i>« Youa, wait up. »</i>

721
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:26,050
Relax, zipperhead.
I'm not gonna shoot you.

722
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:29,720
I'd look down too, if I was you.

723
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:32,730
I knew you were a dipshit
the first time I ever saw you...

724
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:35,240
...but I never thought you were worse
with women...

725
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,740
...than you are at stealing cars, Toad.

726
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:42,070
- It's Thao.
- What?

727
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,580
It's not Toad, it's Thao.
My name is Thao.

728
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:47,645
Yeah, well,
you're blowing it with that girl

729
00:52:47,656 --> 00:52:48,460
who was there.

730
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:51,490
Not that I give two shits
about a toad like you.

731
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,585
You don't know what you're talking about.

732
00:52:53,596 --> 00:52:54,420
You're wrong.

733
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,370
I know exactly what I'm talking about.

734
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:59,000
I may not be the most pleasant person
to be around...

735
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:02,670
...but I got the best woman
that was ever on this planet to marry me.

736
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,800
I worked at it. It was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

737
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:06,918
But you, you know,

738
00:53:06,929 --> 00:53:09,770
you're letting Click Clack,
Ding Dong, and Charlie Chan...

739
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:11,970
...just walk out
with Miss What's-Her-Face.

740
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:16,020
She likes you, you know?
Though I don't know why.

741
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:18,160
Who?

742
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:23,110
Yum Yum. You know,
the girl in the purple sweater.

743
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,490
She's been looking at you all day, stupid.

744
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:29,200
You mean Youa.

745
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:32,700
Yeah, Yum Yum, yeah. Nice girl. Nice girl.
A very charming girl.

746
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:35,200
I talked with her. Yeah.

747
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:38,540
But you, you let her just walk right out
with the Three Stooges.

748
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:41,340
And you know why?
Because you're a big, fat pussy.

749
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:45,630
Well...

750
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:47,930
...I gotta go.

751
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:51,230
Good day, puss-cake.

752
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,320
No. No more.

753
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:11,950
Well, okay, put them over there.

754
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,460
Bye-bye.

755
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:29,770
No, no. No, no more. No more.
Come on. No more, now.

756
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:34,430
No more, please. I...

757
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,520
Is this that chicken-dumpling thing
you brought the other...?

758
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:40,400
Oh, all right.

759
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:44,190
Come on, ladies.

760
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:49,450
Certainly better than beef jerky,
I'll tell you.

761
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:03,470
What's going on?

762
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:06,550
What's going on?

763
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,068
Thao is here to make amends.
He's here to work for you.

764
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:13,470
No, he isn't.
He's not gonna work for me.

765
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:17,010
My mom said he dishonored the family
and now he has to work off his debt.

766
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:19,890
- He'll start tomorrow morning.
- Not tomorrow, not any time.

767
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:23,600
I don't even want him on my property.
I thought we went over all that.

768
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:29,450
It's very important that you accept,
and it would be an insult if you refuse.

769
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:31,320
Why is this being put back on me?

770
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:33,490
He's the one who tried to steal my car.

771
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:35,740
All of a sudden, I'm the bad guy in this.

772
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:38,450
Look, my family is very traditional...

773
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:41,580
...and would be very much upset
if you don't let Thao repay.

774
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:44,130
If he doesn't wanna do it,
then let's just go.

775
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:46,340
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

776
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:50,810
Yeah. Shut up.

777
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:54,140
All right. Tomorrow, come on.

778
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:57,350
Tomorrow. Thank you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

779
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,020
Thank you.

780
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:05,560
Jesus, Joseph, and Mary,
these Hmong broads are like badgers.

781
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:13,780
Son of a bitch, I never thought he'd show.

782
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:22,120
All right. What are you good at?

783
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,120
Like what?

784
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:28,380
Well, that's what I'm asking.

785
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,640
If you're gonna work for me,
I gotta know what you're good at.

786
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,050
I gotta know what you can do.

787
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:35,550
I don't know.

788
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:40,070
Well, that's kind of halfway
what I expected you to say.

789
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,900
You see that tree right there?

790
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:44,690
You just go over there
and count the birds.

791
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:47,520
You want me to count the birds?

792
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:48,993
Yeah, you can count.

793
00:56:49,004 --> 00:56:52,910
All you slopes are supposed
to be good at math, right?

794
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:55,990
- Yeah, I can count.
- Good.

795
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,370
One, two...

796
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:13,170
So, what do you have for me today?
You want me to watch paint dry?

797
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:16,000
Maybe even count the clouds that pass by?

798
00:57:16,011 --> 00:57:18,100
Don't get flip with me, boy.

799
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:21,720
I'm not the one who tried to steal.
Don't you forget that.

800
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:27,480
Go ahead. I don't care if you insult me
or say racist things.

801
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:30,270
Because you know what? I'll take it.

802
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:34,190
Yeah, course you'll take it, because
you have no teeth, you have no balls, kid.

803
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:39,110
Look, I'm stuck here...

804
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:42,700
...so why don't you just find something
useful for me to do?

805
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:47,870
Because unlike you, I'm not useless,
and I maintain my own property.

806
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:51,920
You swamp rats, on the other hand,
you just can't help but...

807
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,390
How long do I have you for?

808
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:03,440
- Toad? How long?
- Till next Friday.

809
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,020
Yeah.

810
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,310
All right.
Go get the ladder out of the garage.

811
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:17,200
When you get finished
with that roof there,

812
00:58:17,211 --> 00:58:19,960
you can take that gutter
and nail it back up.

813
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:23,250
I'm tired of looking at it
the last three years.

814
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:30,540
Yeah.

815
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,590
Yeah, you said it, brother.

816
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,650
Hello.

817
00:59:39,820 --> 00:59:41,530
Grandpa says he wants to know...

818
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:47,870
...if you can have Thao clear out
the big wasp nest under our porch.

819
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:50,080
Wasp nest?

820
00:59:50,250 --> 00:59:51,830
Well, that's terrible.

821
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,040
Yeah, well, I think we can handle that
after lunch.

822
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:35,290
Jesus, Lord Almighty, knock it off.

823
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:39,710
Hey, it's my last day.
So, what else do you have for me to do?

824
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,380
Take the day off. You've done enough.

825
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,640
Toad.

826
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:58,480
Nothing, never mind.

827
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:08,250
The doctor will see you now. Thank you.

828
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:25,590
Koski?

829
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:29,430
Koski?

830
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:32,350
Koski?

831
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:43,620
Mr. Kowalski? Good morning.
I looked over your paperwork...

832
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:47,110
...and I think we should immediately
start a full battery of tests.

833
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,870
I feel that this would be the best
way to go about...

834
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,170
checking out the issues that you've had...

835
01:01:53,181 --> 01:01:53,990
Excuse me.

836
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:56,830
What happened to Dr. Feldman,
my regular doctor?

837
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:02,210
Dr. Feldman retired three years ago.
I'm his replacement, Dr. Chu.

838
01:02:10,350 --> 01:02:12,190
- It's Grandpa Walt.
- Pick it up.

839
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:14,220
- You talk to him.
- Mitch.

840
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,460
- I'm doing bills here.
<i>« - You talk to him. He's your father. »</i>

841
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,650
Hey, Dad.

842
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:30,070
Hi, Mitch, it's... It's me, your dad.

843
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,280
<i>¦ Yeah, I know. What's up? ¦</i>

844
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:34,580
Oh, nothing. Nothing much, really.

845
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:38,110
- How's everything going?
<i>¦ - I'm fine. ¦</i>

846
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,900
Fine. Doing fine.

847
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:45,170
<i>¦ Fine. Good.
How about Karen and the kids? ¦</i>

848
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:49,930
Fine, everybody's great. Doing fine.

849
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:53,510
Good.
How about work?

850
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:55,020
<i>¦ Busy. ¦</i>

851
01:02:55,930 --> 01:02:59,270
<i>¦ - Yeah. ¦</i>
- Yeah, I suppose.

852
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:03,530
In fact, speaking of busy,
I got a lot on my plate right now...

853
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:05,690
...so if there's not something pressing...

854
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:10,540
No. No, not at all.

855
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:13,200
So why don't you call me this weekend?

856
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:14,740
Sure.

857
01:03:14,910 --> 01:03:17,740
<i>¦ Okay. It was nice talking to you, Dad.
Thanks for calling. ¦</i>

858
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:20,960
Thanks. Yeah.

859
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:07,840
This kid doesn't have a chance.

860
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:27,770
- What do you know about faucets?
- I know a lot about them, boy.

861
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,360
Stand aside.

862
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:34,450
- Jesus. For the love of Pete.
- What?

863
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:39,090
It must be a hundred degrees in here.
Why don't you turn on the fan?

864
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:50,560
The place is falling apart.

865
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,470
Man, where'd you get all this stuff?

866
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:01,220
- What are you talking about?
- All the tools and stuff.

867
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:06,030
Well, it may come as a surprise
to a thief...

868
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:08,360
...but I bought this stuff,
everything in here,

869
01:05:08,371 --> 01:05:09,410
with my own money.

870
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:11,580
Yeah, yeah. That's not what I meant.

871
01:05:11,740 --> 01:05:14,040
I mean, there's just so much shit
packed in here.

872
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:18,170
Yeah. Well, every tool in here
has a purpose.

873
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:20,250
Everything has a job to do.

874
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:22,790
They're all to use if necessary.

875
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,220
Okay, so, what's that?

876
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:27,220
- That's a post-hole digger.
- That?

877
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:28,470
Vise grips.

878
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:30,210
<i>¦ - That? ¦</i>
- Wire cutters.

879
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:32,550
You know it's a trowel, come on.

880
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,890
Those are shears there, and that's a saw.

881
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:37,590
That's a tack hammer.
You can't fool me, kid.

882
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:42,510
All right, what's on your mind?

883
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:47,100
It's just, I can't afford
to buy all this stuff.

884
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:51,700
Well, I guess even a bonehead
like you could understand...

885
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:54,940
...that a man acquires this
over a period of 50 years.

886
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:59,240
- Yeah, but...
- All right, look, here.

887
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:03,370
Take these three items, right here.
You can have this.

888
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:09,080
WD-40, vise grips and some duct tape.

889
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:12,960
Any man worth his salt
can do half of the household chores...

890
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:14,630
...with just those three things.

891
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:17,300
Anything else you need,
you just borrow it, that's all.

892
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:19,800
Okay. Cool.

893
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:31,520
- Fuck me.
- What's with that?

894
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:33,820
Nothing. What?

895
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,500
Nothing, huh?
I just saw you coughed up blood.

896
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:39,650
That's not good.
You should really see a doctor.

897
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:43,380
Yeah.

898
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:45,370
Look...

899
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,550
Those guys who were here the other night,
on my lawn.

900
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:51,790
What about them?

901
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:54,040
Just a gang, a bunch of Hmong gangbangers.

902
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:57,130
Yeah, I assumed that,
but what were they doing here?

903
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:59,050
They were gonna take me away.

904
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:03,300
They were kind of pissed
that I blew my first initiation.

905
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:09,560
Yeah. Well, you are a pussy, you know,
you wanna hang out with guys like that.

906
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:11,600
What was your initiation supposed to be?

907
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:23,540
My Gran Torino?

908
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:29,120
Christ all Friday.

909
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:48,780
Shit.

910
01:07:52,690 --> 01:07:54,270
Toad, you got a minute?

911
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,940
All right. Okay.

912
01:07:58,110 --> 01:07:59,530
Here it is.

913
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:03,000
Here's the deal. I take the top
because that's the heaviest.

914
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:05,370
I pull on that,
and you stand right back here...

915
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:08,170
...and you push
and help me push it up each step.

916
01:08:08,330 --> 01:08:10,290
- Just like that.
- Then let me take the top.

917
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:11,760
No, no, I've got the top.

918
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:13,840
Really, I'll take the top.
It looks heavy.

919
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,590
Look, I'm not crippled. I've got the top.

920
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:19,340
If you don't let me take the top,
I ain't helping.

921
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:22,180
- Now, listen to me, zipperhead...
- No, you listen, old man.

922
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:26,180
I'm here because you needed help.
So it's either top or I'm out of here.

923
01:08:29,930 --> 01:08:35,020
All right.
You take the top, and I'll push.

924
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:40,190
Just don't let it slip out
of your little-girl hands and crush me.

925
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,610
Don't give me any ideas, now.

926
01:08:52,830 --> 01:08:55,210
- That thing weighs a ton.
- Yeah.

927
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,381
It runs like a clock, though.

928
01:08:57,392 --> 01:08:59,980
They just don't make them
like this anymore.

929
01:09:00,130 --> 01:09:02,710
So, what are you gonna do with it?

930
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:05,130
Sell it, I guess.

931
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:07,680
How much?

932
01:09:08,510 --> 01:09:11,310
60 bucks. They...

933
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,860
I'm tired of having it sit around
down in the basement there.

934
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:18,360
Why? You looking for a freezer?

935
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,650
The downstairs one kind of died.

936
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:23,690
Okay. 25 bucks and it's yours.

937
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:26,200
Twenty-five? But you just said 60.

938
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:29,330
I know, but this'll save me money
putting an ad in the paper.

939
01:09:29,490 --> 01:09:31,724
Come on,
let's wheel it over to your place.

940
01:09:31,735 --> 01:09:32,800
All right. Okay.

941
01:09:38,170 --> 01:09:40,960
- Kind of ironic, huh?
<i>« - What? »</i>

942
01:09:41,130 --> 01:09:44,090
Toad washing the car
that he tried to steal from you.

943
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:48,470
Yeah. He misses one spot,
he's doing it all over again too.

944
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,680
It's nice of you to look after him
like this.

945
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:53,140
He doesn't have any real role models
in his life.

946
01:09:53,310 --> 01:09:54,810
Well, I'm not any role model.

947
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:56,690
But you're a good man, Wally.

948
01:09:56,850 --> 01:09:58,980
I wish our father
would've been more like you.

949
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:01,820
- Don't go calling me Wally.
- No, I'm serious.

950
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:04,460
He was really hard on us,
really traditional,

951
01:10:04,471 --> 01:10:05,920
and really old-school.

952
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:10,700
- Yeah, well, I'm old-school.
- Yeah, but you're an American.

953
01:10:11,830 --> 01:10:13,660
What's that supposed to mean?

954
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:18,830
You like him, don't you?

955
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,630
Are you kidding? He tried to steal my car.

956
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,810
Uh-huh. And you spend time with him...

957
01:10:23,970 --> 01:10:27,430
...teach him how to fix things,
saved him from that fucked cousin of ours.

958
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:31,220
- Hey. Watch your language, lady.
- And you're a good man.

959
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:34,190
I'm not a good man.

960
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,030
<i>« Get me another beer, dragon lady. »</i>

961
01:10:36,270 --> 01:10:37,570
This one's empty.

962
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:48,650
You know, the Hmong consider gardening
to be women's work.

963
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:53,160
Yeah. That's probably why I see you
in the garden over there all the time.

964
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:55,830
Besides, we ain't in "Humong".

965
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,760
Funny.

966
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:03,720
You know, you should quit.
That's bad for you.

967
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:07,920
Yeah? So is being in a gang, dipshit.

968
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:11,260
Didn't you hear what I just said?
I saw you cough up blood.

969
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:14,770
<i>« You should quit. »</i>

970
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:18,110
So, what's that emblem supposed
to mean anyway?

971
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:21,060
Is it your ancient Cub Scout emblem?

972
01:11:21,940 --> 01:11:25,020
First Cavalry. I've had it since '51.

973
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:30,030
So, what do you want to do with your life,
kid?

974
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:34,130
Well, I was thinking about maybe sales.

975
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,960
Sales, huh?

976
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:39,450
My oldest son is in sales.

977
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:44,170
- Does he do well?
- Oh, yeah. License to steal.

978
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:49,220
I work in the Ford factory for 50 years,
and he's out selling Japanese cars.

979
01:11:49,380 --> 01:11:51,840
- You made cars?
- Yeah.

980
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:55,760
I put the steering column
in this Gran Torino...

981
01:11:55,930 --> 01:11:59,720
...in 1972, right on the line.

982
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:03,230
Oh, you are old. So cool.

983
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:08,940
Yeah. So you wanna be in sales.
You thinking about going to school maybe?

984
01:12:09,110 --> 01:12:13,860
- Kind of, but school costs money.
- Well, maybe you should get a job.

985
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:18,200
You can't just sit there and spread mulch
in my garden the rest of your life.

986
01:12:18,370 --> 01:12:23,000
- Well, maybe you could just pay me.
<i>« - Yeah. Very funny. »</i>

987
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:26,170
Well, what kind of job could I ever get?

988
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:29,680
Yeah. You're right.
Nobody would ever hire you.

989
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,090
Yeah, I know.

990
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:35,890
Look, I'm just kidding, zip.
I mean, you could get a job.

991
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:38,820
- You could get a job anywhere.
- Like what?

992
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:41,610
- Well, how about construction?
- Me?

993
01:12:41,770 --> 01:12:43,140
- Yeah.
- Construction?

994
01:12:43,310 --> 01:12:44,998
You have Alzheimer's or something?

995
01:12:45,009 --> 01:12:47,370
<i>« No. You could get
a job in construction. »</i>

996
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:49,870
I know people in the trades.

997
01:12:50,030 --> 01:12:53,330
Course, I have to make a little adjustment
and man you up a little bit.

998
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:56,450
- Man me up?
<i>« - Yeah. »</i>

999
01:12:56,620 --> 01:13:00,040
And I think you ought to
date Miss Yum Yum too.

1000
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:03,200
Do you a little good.

1001
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,210
You know, get a little carbon
off the valves.

1002
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:14,380
Now you're just gonna learn
how guys talk.

1003
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:18,390
You just listen to the way Martin
and I batter it back and forth.

1004
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,650
- You okay? You ready?
- Sure.

1005
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:23,020
All right. Let's go in.

1006
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:26,320
Perfect.

1007
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:28,860
A Polack and a chink.

1008
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:32,290
How you doing, Martin,
you crazy Italian prick?

1009
01:13:32,450 --> 01:13:34,738
You cheap bastard,
I should've known you'd come in.

1010
01:13:34,749 --> 01:13:36,420
I was having such a pleasant day.

1011
01:13:36,570 --> 01:13:39,410
What'd you do, Jew some poor blind guy
out of his money?

1012
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:42,340
- Gave him the wrong change?
- Who's the Nip?

1013
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,537
Oh, he's a pussy kid from next door.

1014
01:13:44,548 --> 01:13:47,190
I'm just trying to man him up
a little bit.

1015
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:48,970
Mm.

1016
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:52,630
You see, kid? Now, that's how guys
talk to one another.

1017
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:55,130
- They do?
- What, you got shit in your ears?

1018
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:59,340
Now go on out and come back in,
and talk to him like a man.

1019
01:13:59,510 --> 01:14:00,680
Like a real man.

1020
01:14:00,850 --> 01:14:04,270
<i>« - Come on, Walt. »</i>
- Come on. Get your ass out of here.

1021
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,360
And come on back now.

1022
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:09,310
- Sorry about this.
- It's okay.

1023
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,190
What's up, you old Italian prick?

1024
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:19,110
Get out of my shop before
I blow your head off...

1025
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:23,580
- ...you goddamn dick-smoking gook!
- Jesus Christ. Oh, shit.

1026
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,450
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1027
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:28,540
What the hell are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

1028
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:31,630
But that's what you said.
That what you said men say.

1029
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:34,310
You don't just come in
and insult the man in his shop.

1030
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,737
You don't do that.
What happens if you meet some ...

1031
01:14:36,748 --> 01:14:38,280
stranger and get the wrong one?

1032
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:40,388
He's gonna blow your gook head right off.

1033
01:14:40,399 --> 01:14:42,030
What should I have said, then?

1034
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:45,890
Yeah, kid, why don't you start
with "Hi" or "Hello"?

1035
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:47,310
Yeah, just come in and say:

1036
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:49,480
"Sir, I'd like a haircut,
if you have time."

1037
01:14:49,650 --> 01:14:51,660
Yeah, be polite, but don't kiss ass.

1038
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:54,780
<i>« You could talk about a construction job
you just came from... »</i>

1039
01:14:54,940 --> 01:14:57,900
...and bitch about your girlfriend
and your car.

1040
01:14:58,070 --> 01:15:00,026
Son of a bitch,
I just got my brakes fixed,

1041
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:02,170
and those sons of bitches
really nailed me.

1042
01:15:02,330 --> 01:15:04,184
I mean,
they screwed me right in the ass.

1043
01:15:04,195 --> 01:15:05,430
<i>« Don't swear at the guy. »</i>

1044
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:08,290
Just talk about people
who are not in the room.

1045
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:12,220
You could bitch about your boss making you
work overtime when it's bowling night.

1046
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:15,710
Right. Or my old lady bitches
for two goddamn hours...

1047
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:19,340
...about how they don't take
expired coupons at the grocery store...

1048
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:23,890
...and the minute I turn on the game,
she starts crying how we never talk.

1049
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:26,650
You see? Now go out, come back
and talk to him.

1050
01:15:26,810 --> 01:15:29,310
And it ain't rocket science,
for chrissake.

1051
01:15:29,810 --> 01:15:34,650
Yeah, but I don't have a job, a car
or a girlfriend.

1052
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:37,580
Jesus. I should've blown his head off
when I had the chance.

1053
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:38,870
Yeah. Maybe so.

1054
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:42,410
Now, okay, I want you to turn around
and go outside...

1055
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:45,880
...and come back, and don't talk
about having no job...

1056
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:50,260
...no car, no girlfriend,
no future, no dick.

1057
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:53,300
Okay? Just turn around and go.

1058
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:10,990
Excuse me, sir. I need a haircut,
if you ain't too busy.

1059
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:14,070
You old Italian son-of-a-bitch
prick barber.

1060
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:19,070
Boy, does my ass hurt from all the guys
at my construction job.

1061
01:16:24,370 --> 01:16:25,420
Fuck me.

1062
01:16:26,370 --> 01:16:28,080
Jesus Christ.

1063
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:41,420
- All set to go through with it, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

1064
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:42,997
Don't "Yeah, yeah" me.

1065
01:16:43,008 --> 01:16:46,270
Just say, "Yes, sir",
and, "I'll do my best".

1066
01:16:46,430 --> 01:16:47,800
Yes. I'll do my best.

1067
01:16:47,970 --> 01:16:51,100
Because when I vouch for somebody,
that means I've given my word.

1068
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:55,520
- And I don't want you making me look bad.
- No, I'm good. Totally into this.

1069
01:16:55,690 --> 01:16:59,400
Don't lay down, either.
Just look them straight in the eye.

1070
01:16:59,570 --> 01:17:02,070
And a man can tell a lot
by your handshake.

1071
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:06,110
- Here. Put those in your back pocket.
- Cool.

1072
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:07,780
Don't blow this.

1073
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:12,870
Hey, Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon.
How the hell are you?

1074
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:16,870
- I'm shitty, but who's gonna listen?
- Not me, that's for sure.

1075
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:21,300
Help yourself, there, Walt.
You dumb Polack.

1076
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:24,050
Okay, this is the kid
I was telling you about.

1077
01:17:24,220 --> 01:17:28,550
Thao, this is Tim Kennedy.
He's the super on this job.

1078
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:31,970
So, what do we got here, Walt?

1079
01:17:32,230 --> 01:17:36,740
Well, he knows construction,
and he's a smart kid.

1080
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:38,530
He'll do anything you need him for.

1081
01:17:38,690 --> 01:17:40,520
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1082
01:17:40,690 --> 01:17:43,940
- You speak English?
- Yes, sir.

1083
01:17:44,110 --> 01:17:46,450
- Were you born here?
- You bet.

1084
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:49,790
I see that Walt drove you here.
You got a vehicle?

1085
01:17:49,950 --> 01:17:52,030
Not at the moment.
Taking the bus for now.

1086
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:54,830
The bus. Jesus Christ,
you don't have a car?

1087
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,250
My head gasket cracked.

1088
01:17:56,420 --> 01:17:59,510
And the goddamn prick at the shop
wants to bend me over for 2100.

1089
01:17:59,670 --> 01:18:00,670
Oh, please.

1090
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:04,510
I replaced the tranny in my Tahoe,
and the sons of bitches fucked me hard.

1091
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:06,250
<i>« Just under 3200. »</i>

1092
01:18:07,070 --> 01:18:08,570
Goddamn thieves. It ain't right.

1093
01:18:09,220 --> 01:18:10,800
You got that right.

1094
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:15,640
Okay, come on in on Monday,
and we'll find something for you to do.

1095
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,570
- Thanks, Mr. Kennedy.
- It's Tim. And what's your name again?

1096
01:18:20,730 --> 01:18:23,190
- Thao.
- "Tuh", okay.

1097
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,230
You owe me one, Walt.

1098
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:28,700
Yeah. Well, I'll buy you a fruitcake
for Christmas.

1099
01:18:28,870 --> 01:18:33,670
Fuck the fruitcake. How about you just
hand over them keys to that Gran Torino?

1100
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:38,300
- Why the hell does everybody want my car?
- Well, I'm not surprised.

1101
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:42,840
Yeah, you don't know the half of it.
All right, come on, zipperhead.

1102
01:18:43,010 --> 01:18:47,350
We'll let the mick stay here
and play with himself.

1103
01:19:07,660 --> 01:19:09,080
What are we doing?

1104
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:13,570
What do you wanna do?
Carry your tools in a rice bag?

1105
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:25,100
Here we are. You can use one of these.

1106
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:28,260
And you'll need one of these. Here.

1107
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:31,800
- I can't afford any of this.
- I'll cover it.

1108
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:34,100
You can pay me back
on your first paycheck.

1109
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:37,980
<i>« - Cool.
- Here. You'll need something like that. »</i>

1110
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:41,350
Now, this is what I'm looking for.
Here, tool belt.

1111
01:19:42,110 --> 01:19:43,530
- There you go.
- Not to bitch...

1112
01:19:43,690 --> 01:19:45,440
...but won't I be needing some tools?

1113
01:19:45,610 --> 01:19:48,260
Tools I've got,
but I'm not gonna lend my tool belt.

1114
01:19:48,271 --> 01:19:50,120
You can pick up tools as you go.

1115
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:52,820
- I really appreciate all this.
- Forget it.

1116
01:19:52,990 --> 01:19:56,280
No. I really do. Thank you.

1117
01:20:32,030 --> 01:20:34,240
What's up, homeboy? What you doing?

1118
01:20:34,410 --> 01:20:36,950
- What up, man?
- What you got, punk?

1119
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:40,790
- Just checking up on my little cousin.
- Yeah, man.

1120
01:20:41,500 --> 01:20:45,540
- Our little cousin. What's this?
- Where you coming from, man?

1121
01:20:45,710 --> 01:20:48,000
I'm coming home from work.

1122
01:20:48,170 --> 01:20:50,340
Not that you guys would know
much about that.

1123
01:20:50,510 --> 01:20:51,970
So it's true. You got a job.

1124
01:20:52,130 --> 01:20:54,260
- You can't just leave me alone?
- What?

1125
01:20:55,010 --> 01:20:56,097
Hey, dog, check this out.

1126
01:20:57,470 --> 01:20:58,510
You scared, huh?

1127
01:20:58,524 --> 01:21:00,220
Who bought this shit for you? Your dad?

1128
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:02,057
- What do you want?
- Your dad bought this?

1129
01:21:02,067 --> 01:21:04,690
- Keep your hands off my stuff.
- Give me the fucking hat.

1130
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:08,820
- Why the fuck you gotta make me look bad?
- Keep your hands off my stuff!

1131
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:10,440
Smashing's my job, man.

1132
01:21:12,490 --> 01:21:14,950
- Yo, give me that.
- Hey, come on. That's my stuff.

1133
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,960
Throw it over the fence, man, fuck it.

1134
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:20,280
- Let me go. Let me go.
- Hey, you little bitch.

1135
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:22,200
Give me that, man. Give me that.

1136
01:21:25,210 --> 01:21:28,040
- What's the phrase I'm looking for?
- Fuck him up.

1137
01:21:28,210 --> 01:21:30,630
Oh, yeah. Saving face.

1138
01:21:38,470 --> 01:21:43,140
- Hey there.
- Hey. I gotta run.

1139
01:21:43,390 --> 01:21:45,850
Haven't seen you in a few days.
Where you been?

1140
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:47,900
- Been busy.
- Yeah.

1141
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:50,780
Busy, huh?

1142
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:54,070
Hey.

1143
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:57,240
- What the hell happened to you?
- Don't worry about it.

1144
01:21:57,410 --> 01:22:00,070
What do you mean, don't worry about it?
Look at your face.

1145
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:02,910
I said, don't worry about it.
Okay? It's not your problem.

1146
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,580
When?

1147
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:08,540
Grabbed me a couple days ago,
right after I got off work.

1148
01:22:08,710 --> 01:22:10,330
Cowards.

1149
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:15,050
I did everything I could possibly do,
but they broke some of your tools.

1150
01:22:15,590 --> 01:22:19,090
- I'll replace them.
- Don't worry about the tools.

1151
01:22:22,930 --> 01:22:25,470
Where does your cousin live?

1152
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:31,120
No, Walt. I'll be okay.

1153
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,390
I don't want you to do anything.

1154
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:35,100
All right.

1155
01:22:36,070 --> 01:22:40,780
If you need any extra tools,
you just let me know.

1156
01:22:41,450 --> 01:22:43,740
Well, I could use a roofing hammer.

1157
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:47,420
Good. Go in my garage and get it.

1158
01:23:23,490 --> 01:23:25,830
That should be the last of them.

1159
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:33,670
Hey.

1160
01:23:51,190 --> 01:23:55,360
All right. Here's the deal.
You stay away from Thao, understand?

1161
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:58,330
You tell your friends
to stay away from Thao.

1162
01:23:58,490 --> 01:24:01,500
If they don't listen, tell them
you don't wanna see them anymore.

1163
01:24:01,660 --> 01:24:03,370
That's it. Got it?

1164
01:24:03,530 --> 01:24:06,080
I'll take that as a yes.
If I have to come back here...

1165
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:09,090
...it's gonna get fucking ugly.

1166
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:35,400
Get out of my way.

1167
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:57,890
How do you want your dog?
I mean, steak?

1168
01:24:58,050 --> 01:25:01,430
- Funny.
- I told you, we only eat cats.

1169
01:25:01,590 --> 01:25:04,300
Yeah. Well.

1170
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:06,800
Whoa.
I've never seen you like this before.

1171
01:25:06,970 --> 01:25:09,850
I'm feeling good. You know,
I got beautiful women, great food.

1172
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:13,110
- And Thao.
- And even Thao isn't bugging me.

1173
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:15,490
- Having a good time, I see.
- Yeah.

1174
01:25:15,650 --> 01:25:19,530
- And it never ends.
- What happened to your knuckles anyway?

1175
01:25:21,110 --> 01:25:23,820
I slipped in the shower. No big problem.

1176
01:25:23,990 --> 01:25:26,610
Look, now, Yum Yum,
if he doesn't ask you out...

1177
01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:28,280
...I'm gonna ask you out.

1178
01:25:28,450 --> 01:25:32,700
Youa, don't listen to him, Youa.
He's a white devil.

1179
01:25:32,870 --> 01:25:34,790
Yeah, I am. I'm the white devil.

1180
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:37,630
I'd love to, Walt, but he beat you to it.

1181
01:25:37,790 --> 01:25:41,880
Really? No kidding.
Dinner and a movie or what?

1182
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:48,300
Yeah. They're taking the bus.

1183
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:50,690
No, you can't take the bus.

1184
01:25:50,850 --> 01:25:53,640
We gotta get you something
more stylish than that.

1185
01:25:53,810 --> 01:25:56,100
Like what? Take a limo?

1186
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:58,480
How about that?

1187
01:26:02,110 --> 01:26:04,570
- The Gran Torino?
- Yeah.

1188
01:26:04,740 --> 01:26:09,240
- You'd let me take the Gran Torino?
- Yeah, I'd let you take the Gran Torino.

1189
01:26:09,410 --> 01:26:10,490
Really?

1190
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:14,170
Yeah, really.

1191
01:26:17,670 --> 01:26:19,290
Yeah. Yeah.

1192
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:23,250
<i>¦ Here's the pitch. And a strike. ¦</i>

1193
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:02,130
Is everybody all right?

1194
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:10,010
You're all right. You're okay.
You've got a cut.

1195
01:27:10,180 --> 01:27:12,698
It's all right, it's all right,
it's all right.

1196
01:27:12,709 --> 01:27:13,810
Where's grandma?

1197
01:27:15,850 --> 01:27:18,640
Where is Sue? Where is Sue?

1198
01:27:18,810 --> 01:27:21,270
- She went to our aunt's.
- Your aunt's? You sure?

1199
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:24,730
- Yeah.
- Get on the phone and call right now.

1200
01:27:57,020 --> 01:27:59,780
I knew this was gonna happen.

1201
01:28:00,270 --> 01:28:03,690
Tried to... What the hell am I doing here?

1202
01:28:03,860 --> 01:28:07,580
Well, maybe some of her friends called
and they changed plans.

1203
01:28:08,110 --> 01:28:09,820
Yeah.

1204
01:28:11,990 --> 01:28:17,950
In the war, we just lost a lot of friends,
but you're kind of set for it.

1205
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:20,250
You're geared to it.

1206
01:29:17,350 --> 01:29:20,800
No, no, no.

1207
01:29:29,650 --> 01:29:32,650
You fuck! You rotten fuck!

1208
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:26,250
Mr. Kowalski?

1209
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:41,220
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

1210
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:42,860
The police finally left.

1211
01:30:43,810 --> 01:30:45,520
No one's talking.

1212
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:49,020
One thing about the Hmong,
they keep their mouths shut.

1213
01:30:49,190 --> 01:30:50,770
Yeah, I've noticed that.

1214
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:02,630
You know, Thao and Sue are never
gonna find peace in this world...

1215
01:31:03,620 --> 01:31:05,120
...as long as that gang's around.

1216
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:09,960
Until they go away, you know, forever.

1217
01:31:13,420 --> 01:31:15,090
What are you saying?

1218
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:18,140
You know what I'm saying.

1219
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:21,470
I took Sue to the hospital.

1220
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:26,230
She's scared. They're all scared.

1221
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:28,100
Yeah.

1222
01:31:29,690 --> 01:31:31,140
Thao, especially.

1223
01:31:31,310 --> 01:31:34,310
He's sitting out there right now,
staring at your front door.

1224
01:31:35,780 --> 01:31:38,410
You know what he expects, Mr. Kowalski.

1225
01:31:39,820 --> 01:31:41,450
What would you do?

1226
01:31:42,490 --> 01:31:46,830
- What should Thao do?
- I know what I would do if I was you.

1227
01:31:47,830 --> 01:31:50,958
Or at least what you think
you should do.

1228
01:31:50,969 --> 01:31:52,010
Really?

1229
01:31:52,460 --> 01:31:55,670
If I was Thao, I guess I'd want vengeance.

1230
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:59,420
I'd wanna stand shoulder to shoulder
with you and kill those guys.

1231
01:32:00,470 --> 01:32:01,840
And you?

1232
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:04,140
What would I do?

1233
01:32:07,310 --> 01:32:09,430
I'd come over here and talk to you,
I guess.

1234
01:32:11,270 --> 01:32:15,020
I know you're close with these people,
but this pisses me off too, Mr. Kowalski.

1235
01:32:18,030 --> 01:32:19,480
Want a beer?

1236
01:32:20,030 --> 01:32:21,360
I'd love one.

1237
01:32:21,530 --> 01:32:24,990
There's some in the chest
right over there behind you.

1238
01:32:50,390 --> 01:32:52,020
Damn all this.

1239
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:57,400
- Just isn't fair.
- Nothing's fair, Father.

1240
01:33:00,740 --> 01:33:03,080
So, what are you gonna do,
Mr. Kowalski?

1241
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:06,820
Call me Walt.

1242
01:33:07,990 --> 01:33:09,580
All right.

1243
01:33:10,790 --> 01:33:12,830
What are you gonna do, Walt?

1244
01:33:13,580 --> 01:33:15,330
I don't know...

1245
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:18,100
...but I'll think of something.

1246
01:33:19,420 --> 01:33:22,960
Whatever it is,
they won't have a chance.

1247
01:33:34,730 --> 01:33:35,770
What are you doing?

1248
01:33:37,070 --> 01:33:41,200
- Thinking.
- Thinking? Thinking time is over.

1249
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:44,530
Now it's time to knock the shit
out of those pricks.

1250
01:33:44,990 --> 01:33:48,950
I know you don't wanna hear this,
but now's the time to stay calm.

1251
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:51,160
Calm? You want me to be calm?

1252
01:33:51,330 --> 01:33:56,120
We stay calm or else mistakes get made.
We have to step back from this thing.

1253
01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:00,210
No. Don't let me down, Walt. Not you.

1254
01:34:00,380 --> 01:34:02,460
This is gonna end today.

1255
01:34:03,260 --> 01:34:04,380
Sit down.

1256
01:34:04,550 --> 01:34:08,010
- I don't wanna sit.
- I said, sit down.

1257
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:15,980
Now, listen to me. We gotta plan this,
and plan it very carefully.

1258
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:18,520
We can't make any mistakes.

1259
01:34:18,690 --> 01:34:21,570
Now, you know I'm the right man
for this job.

1260
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:23,990
So I want you to go home and stay calm...

1261
01:34:24,150 --> 01:34:26,820
and come back here at 4 this afternoon.

1262
01:34:26,990 --> 01:34:31,990
- And what needs to be done will be done.
- I say we go now. Right now.

1263
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:35,160
And what? Kill that cousin of yours
and the rest of those zips?

1264
01:34:35,330 --> 01:34:38,420
Mr. Tough Guy out for blood
all of a sudden?

1265
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:41,050
You know nothing about it.

1266
01:34:44,010 --> 01:34:48,020
Now go home and you stay calm.

1267
01:34:48,180 --> 01:34:51,260
Come back here at 4. All right?

1268
01:34:53,180 --> 01:34:54,970
Okay?

1269
01:34:57,310 --> 01:34:58,850
Okay.

1270
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:31,680
Yeah. I know, I know.
Give me a break, will you?

1271
01:35:31,850 --> 01:35:35,070
It's the first time I've ever smoked
in the house.

1272
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:40,990
Let a man enjoy himself, would you, girl?

1273
01:35:44,190 --> 01:35:46,440
All finished. Ten dollars American.

1274
01:35:46,610 --> 01:35:50,150
I don't suppose your Guinea hands
are steady enough to do a straight shave?

1275
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:52,990
Straight shave?
You've never asked for a straight shave.

1276
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:57,200
I know, but I've always wondered about it.
That's unless you're too busy.

1277
01:35:57,370 --> 01:36:01,830
- No, just let me heat up a towel.
- Yeah. And here, here's a 20.

1278
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:06,500
Keep the change.
That's just in case you hit my jugular.

1279
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:17,110
It's gonna take about one hour.

1280
01:36:17,270 --> 01:36:19,940
We gonna shorten the sleeves a little bit.

1281
01:36:20,690 --> 01:36:22,950
Gonna fix the shoulder.

1282
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:27,530
- Yeah. I never had a fitted suit before.
- Yes, sir.

1283
01:36:27,690 --> 01:36:31,110
- Mm-hm.
- You look very good.

1284
01:36:38,910 --> 01:36:40,670
What can I do for you, Mr. Kowalski?

1285
01:36:40,980 --> 01:36:42,480
I'm here for a confession.

1286
01:36:43,130 --> 01:36:45,140
Oh, Lord Jesus. What have you done?

1287
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:48,050
- Nothing. You just take it easy, now.
- What are you up to?

1288
01:36:48,210 --> 01:36:50,590
Are you gonna give me a confession or not?

1289
01:36:54,220 --> 01:36:56,430
How long has it been
since your last confession?

1290
01:36:56,600 --> 01:36:58,970
Oh, forever.

1291
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:03,810
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

1292
01:37:03,980 --> 01:37:06,310
What are your sins, my son?

1293
01:37:07,650 --> 01:37:11,900
Well, in 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski...

1294
01:37:12,070 --> 01:37:14,740
...at the factory Christmas party.

1295
01:37:14,910 --> 01:37:18,160
Dorothy was in the other room
with the other wives.

1296
01:37:18,830 --> 01:37:20,950
It just happened.

1297
01:37:21,330 --> 01:37:23,410
Yes, go on.

1298
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:27,330
Well, I made a 900-dollars profit
selling a boat and a motor.

1299
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,420
I didn't pay the taxes.
It's the same as stealing.

1300
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:34,020
Yes, fine.

1301
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:36,340
Oh, lastly...

1302
01:37:38,010 --> 01:37:41,470
...I was never very close
with my two sons.

1303
01:37:42,190 --> 01:37:45,320
I don't know them. I didn't know how.

1304
01:37:48,020 --> 01:37:49,610
That's it?

1305
01:37:49,820 --> 01:37:55,040
That's it? It's bothered me
most of my life.

1306
01:37:56,450 --> 01:37:59,490
Say 10 "Hail Marys"
and five "Our Fathers".

1307
01:37:59,660 --> 01:38:04,160
God loves you and forgives you,
and I absolve you of all your sins.

1308
01:38:04,330 --> 01:38:08,710
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

1309
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:12,210
Thank you, <i>< Padre ></i>.

1310
01:38:15,260 --> 01:38:18,300
Are you going to retaliate
for what happened to Sue?

1311
01:38:19,260 --> 01:38:21,640
I'm going over to that house today,
Mr. Kowalski.

1312
01:38:21,810 --> 01:38:22,850
Is that so?

1313
01:38:23,020 --> 01:38:27,240
It is. And every other day until you see
the folly in what you're planning.

1314
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:31,740
- Busy day. Gotta go.
- Go in peace.

1315
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:35,240
Oh, I am at peace.

1316
01:38:37,740 --> 01:38:40,070
Jesus Christ.

1317
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:56,090
So which one's mine?

1318
01:38:57,260 --> 01:39:00,430
You ever fired a weapon before?

1319
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:01,860
No.

1320
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:06,890
Well, why don't you put that one down?

1321
01:39:07,060 --> 01:39:09,350
And I got something I wanna show you.
Come on.

1322
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:10,840
What?

1323
01:39:14,990 --> 01:39:20,120
1952, we were sent up to take out
a chink machine-gun nest.

1324
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:22,370
Been shredding us up pretty good.

1325
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:24,920
I was the only one
that came back that day.

1326
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:28,960
For that, they gave me a Silver Star.
Here it is.

1327
01:39:30,670 --> 01:39:33,630
Here. I want you to have it.

1328
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:35,970
Why?

1329
01:39:36,130 --> 01:39:37,153
Why?

1330
01:39:37,164 --> 01:39:40,230
Because we all knew the dangers
that night, but we went anyway.

1331
01:39:40,390 --> 01:39:42,810
That's the way it might be tonight.

1332
01:39:42,970 --> 01:39:45,140
There's always a chance
you don't come back.

1333
01:39:45,310 --> 01:39:48,640
The hell we won't. We're gonna roll up
in there and tear some ass.

1334
01:39:48,810 --> 01:39:52,480
That's foolish. That's the exact reaction
they're waiting for.

1335
01:39:52,650 --> 01:39:54,310
Go ahead and close this up.

1336
01:39:54,820 --> 01:39:57,990
- How many?
- How many what?

1337
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:01,320
How many men did you kill in Korea?

1338
01:40:01,740 --> 01:40:06,660
- Thirteen. Maybe more.
- What was it like to kill a man?

1339
01:40:07,540 --> 01:40:09,870
You don't wanna know.

1340
01:40:10,540 --> 01:40:12,750
Now close it up.

1341
01:40:27,680 --> 01:40:31,180
Walt. Walt. What are you doing?

1342
01:40:32,020 --> 01:40:35,940
- What are you doing?
- Relax. You can't get out of there.

1343
01:40:36,110 --> 01:40:38,690
You let me out right now.
Let me out.

1344
01:40:38,860 --> 01:40:41,103
Fucking let me out or
I'll fucking kill you.

1345
01:40:41,114 --> 01:40:42,210
Shut the fuck up.

1346
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:44,920
You wanna know
what it's like to kill a man?

1347
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:47,090
Well, it's goddamn awful,
that's what it is.

1348
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:49,170
The only thing worse
is getting a medal...

1349
01:40:49,330 --> 01:40:53,290
...for killing some poor kid
that wanted to just give up, that's all.

1350
01:40:53,460 --> 01:40:56,460
Yeah, some scared little gook
just like you.

1351
01:40:56,630 --> 01:41:00,550
I shot him in the face with that rifle
you were holding in there a while ago.

1352
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:03,012
Not a day goes by that
I don't think about it,

1353
01:41:03,023 --> 01:41:05,070
and you don't want
that on your soul.

1354
01:41:05,220 --> 01:41:07,850
Now, I got blood on my hands.
I'm soiled.

1355
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:11,150
That's why I'm going it alone tonight.

1356
01:41:11,310 --> 01:41:15,520
Walt. You take me with you right now.
Let me out!

1357
01:41:15,690 --> 01:41:20,400
Look, you've come a long way.
I'm proud to say that you're my friend...

1358
01:41:20,570 --> 01:41:22,899
...but you got your whole life
ahead of you.

1359
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:24,410
But me, I finish things.

1360
01:41:24,570 --> 01:41:28,240
That's what I do. And I'm going it alone.

1361
01:41:28,410 --> 01:41:32,450
No. Wait!
Walt! Walt!

1362
01:41:32,620 --> 01:41:36,330
Walt! Walt! Walt!

1363
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:53,810
Look, I need you to watch my dog.

1364
01:41:55,610 --> 01:41:57,950
Yeah, I love you too.

1365
01:42:03,320 --> 01:42:05,860
Yeah, she's old too.

1366
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:11,790
Bye-bye, sweetheart. Take it easy.
Her name is Daisy.

1367
01:42:28,180 --> 01:42:30,430
- Hello?
<i>¦ - It's Walt. ¦</i>

1368
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:33,770
The keys to my house are under
the ceramic turtle on the porch.

1369
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:36,790
Let yourself in.
Your brother's in the basement.

1370
01:42:36,801 --> 01:42:37,750
I gotta go.

1371
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,970
Sorry, Father, we have to go.

1372
01:42:57,120 --> 01:43:00,630
I'm telling you, if we're not here,
there will be bloodshed.

1373
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:02,640
We've been here for hours.

1374
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:05,060
We can't afford to anchor a unit
to one location.

1375
01:43:05,220 --> 01:43:06,680
I'm begging you to stay.

1376
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:09,840
Just got word from my sergeant.
We're pulling the plug.

1377
01:43:10,850 --> 01:43:13,690
- I'm staying.
- No, you aren't.

1378
01:43:14,930 --> 01:43:18,850
We have specific orders.
You came with us, you're leaving with us.

1379
01:43:19,020 --> 01:43:20,850
Watch your head.

1380
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:32,960
Sue. Over here. Over here.

1381
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:34,740
- Come unlock this.
- What's going on?

1382
01:43:34,910 --> 01:43:38,870
He left without me.
He went to Smokie's without me.

1383
01:43:40,040 --> 01:43:41,870
Thao!

1384
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:08,150
What the fuck, man?

1385
01:44:11,910 --> 01:44:14,420
Any swamp rats in there?

1386
01:44:15,330 --> 01:44:18,040
- I didn't think your ass would've came.
- Shut up, gook.

1387
01:44:19,210 --> 01:44:22,930
I got nothing to say to you,
shrimp-dick midget like you.

1388
01:44:26,590 --> 01:44:30,880
Yeah, yeah. You go ahead,
watch out for your boyfriend.

1389
01:44:31,050 --> 01:44:35,680
Because it was either he or you or someone
who raped one of their own family.

1390
01:44:35,850 --> 01:44:38,100
Your own blood, for chrissake.

1391
01:44:39,100 --> 01:44:42,980
Now, go ahead and pull those pistols
like miniature cowboys.

1392
01:44:43,150 --> 01:44:45,280
- Go ahead.
- So where's Thao at?

1393
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:49,320
- That pussy motherfucker couldn't come?
- Don't worry about Thao.

1394
01:44:49,490 --> 01:44:52,580
Thao's got not one second for you.

1395
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:56,530
<i>« Says who? You? »</i>

1396
01:44:57,200 --> 01:44:59,240
<i>« What the fuck you gonna do, old man? »</i>

1397
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:03,470
<i>« What you gonna do... »</i>

1398
01:45:03,630 --> 01:45:05,130
<i>« - ...punk ass old man?
- Bitch. »</i>

1399
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,130
- Kind of jumpy, aren't we?
- Shut the fuck up.

1400
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:11,260
You shut the fuck up.

1401
01:45:22,730 --> 01:45:25,480
- Got a light?
<i>« - What the fuck? »</i>

1402
01:45:29,490 --> 01:45:31,290
No.

1403
01:45:32,150 --> 01:45:35,820
Me. I've got a light.

1404
01:45:39,620 --> 01:45:41,790
Hail Mary, full of grace.

1405
01:46:47,810 --> 01:46:50,230
- Yes, Sergeant.
- What happened?

1406
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:52,570
- You need to step back.
- He's a friend of mine.

1407
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:54,620
I said, step back.

1408
01:46:55,820 --> 01:46:58,070
Hey, did you hear him? Step back.

1409
01:46:58,240 --> 01:47:00,570
- What happened?
- Hey, step back.

1410
01:47:01,740 --> 01:47:02,910
He's my friend.

1411
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:04,580
Please, it's important.

1412
01:47:05,540 --> 01:47:08,160
He went for his lighter and they shot him.

1413
01:47:08,330 --> 01:47:10,920
He didn't even have a gun on him.

1414
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:15,430
This time we have witnesses.

1415
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:17,634
These guys will be locked up
for a long time.

1416
01:47:17,644 --> 01:47:19,440
Officer Chang! Get those people back.

1417
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:22,650
You have to step back now, okay?

1418
01:47:41,490 --> 01:47:44,080
Get them the fuck out of here.
Get them out of here.

1419
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:24,340
Walt Kowalski once said to me

1420
01:49:24,351 --> 01:49:27,400
that I didn't know anything
about life or death...

1421
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:28,930
because I was an...

1422
01:49:29,540 --> 01:49:31,540
<i>« over-educated, 27-year-old virgin... »</i>

1423
01:49:32,190 --> 01:49:36,070
<i>« who held the hands of superstitious old
women and promised them eternity. »</i>

1424
01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:40,860
Walt definitely had no problem
calling it like he saw it...

1425
01:49:41,610 --> 01:49:43,740
<i>« but he was right. »</i>

1426
01:49:43,910 --> 01:49:49,090
<i>« I knew really nothing about life or
death until I got to know Walt. »</i>

1427
01:49:50,120 --> 01:49:52,160
And, boy, did I learn.

1428
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:02,770
"And I wanna leave my house to the church
because Dorothy would've liked it."

1429
01:50:06,140 --> 01:50:08,730
Now, which brings us to our last item,
and again...

1430
01:50:08,890 --> 01:50:11,720
...please excuse the language
in Mr. Kowalski's will.

1431
01:50:11,890 --> 01:50:14,680
I'm simply reading it
the way it was written.

1432
01:50:16,110 --> 01:50:21,740
"And I'd like to leave
my 1972 Gran Torino to..."

1433
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:28,410
<i>« "my friend..." »</i>

1434
01:50:29,620 --> 01:50:32,950
"Thao Vang Lor..."

1435
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:35,697
<i>« "... on the condition that
you don't chop-top the roof" »</i>

1436
01:50:35,708 --> 01:50:37,300
<i>« "like one of those beaners..." »</i>

1437
01:50:37,460 --> 01:50:42,550
<i>« "don't paint any idiotic flames on it
like some white-trash hillbilly..." »</i>

1438
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:45,180
<i>« "and don't put a big, gay spoiler
on the rear end..." »</i>

1439
01:50:45,340 --> 01:50:48,050
<i>« "like you see
on all the other zipperheads' cars." »</i>

1440
01:50:48,220 --> 01:50:49,680
<i>« "It just looks like hell." »</i>

1441
01:50:49,850 --> 01:50:53,255
<i>« "If you can refrain
from doing any of that," »</i>

1442
01:50:53,266 --> 01:50:54,580
<i>« "it's yours." »</i>
