1
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:11,168
Gentlemen, cock your pistols.

2
00:01:15,548 --> 00:01:16,632
Gentlemen!

3
00:01:16,806 --> 00:01:21,768
<i>Barry's father had been bred,
like many sons of genteel families...</i>

4
00:01:22,472 --> 00:01:24,431
<i>to the profession of the law.</i>

5
00:01:24,724 --> 00:01:28,686
<i>There is no doubt he would've made
an eminent figure in his profession...</i>

6
00:01:29,312 --> 00:01:31,563
<i>had he not been killed in a duel...</i>

7
00:01:32,357 --> 00:01:34,984
<i>which arose over the purchase
of some horses.</i>

8
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:53,168
<i>Barry's mother,
after her husband's death...</i>

9
00:01:53,753 --> 00:01:56,380
<i>lived in such a way
as to defy slander.</i>

10
00:01:58,091 --> 00:02:01,719
<i>Many a man who had been smitten
by the charms of the spinster...</i>

11
00:02:02,095 --> 00:02:04,054
<i>renewed his offers to the widow.</i>

12
00:02:05,598 --> 00:02:08,225
<i>But she refused all proposals
of marriage...</i>

13
00:02:08,977 --> 00:02:11,895
<i>declaring that she lived
only for her son...</i>

14
00:02:12,564 --> 00:02:14,898
<i>and the memory of her departed saint.</i>

15
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:11,914
<i>First love! What a change
it makes in a lad.</i>

16
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:16,585
<i>What a magnificent secret it is
that he carries about with him!</i>

17
00:03:18,922 --> 00:03:22,674
<i>The tender passion gushes out
of a man's heart.</i>

18
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:26,512
<i>He loves as a bird sings...</i>

19
00:03:27,055 --> 00:03:29,765
<i>or a rose blows from nature.</i>

20
00:03:32,352 --> 00:03:33,435
Killarney.

21
00:03:36,147 --> 00:03:38,440
Now, what shall it be?

22
00:03:42,612 --> 00:03:44,571
Turn around and face the wall.

23
00:03:54,624 --> 00:03:56,917
<i>The object of Barry's attention...</i>

24
00:03:57,085 --> 00:03:59,670
<i>and the cause of his early troubles...</i>

25
00:03:59,838 --> 00:04:03,257
<i>was his cousin,
Nora Brady by name.</i>

26
00:04:15,395 --> 00:04:19,523
I have taken the ribbon from around my neck
and hidden it somewhere on my person.

27
00:04:21,317 --> 00:04:23,443
If you find it, you can have it.

28
00:04:24,612 --> 00:04:26,864
You are free to look anywhere for it.

29
00:04:27,657 --> 00:04:30,450
I will think little of you
if you do not find it.

30
00:04:58,188 --> 00:04:59,521
I cannot find it.

31
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,984
You haven't looked properly.

32
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:19,333
I cannot find it.

33
00:05:25,882 --> 00:05:27,382
I'll give you a hint.

34
00:05:47,028 --> 00:05:48,820
I feel the ribbon.

35
00:05:54,077 --> 00:05:55,535
Why are you trembling?

36
00:05:58,581 --> 00:05:59,998
At...

37
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:03,502
At the pleasure of finding the ribbon.

38
00:06:10,677 --> 00:06:11,677
Liar.

39
00:06:28,403 --> 00:06:33,282
Company, forward march!

40
00:07:11,237 --> 00:07:14,573
Company, eyes left!

41
00:07:17,535 --> 00:07:21,997
<i>About this time the United Kingdom
was in a state of great excitement...</i>

42
00:07:22,457 --> 00:07:26,376
<i>by a threat generally accredited
of a French invasion.</i>

43
00:07:27,628 --> 00:07:30,005
<i>And the noblemen and people of condition...</i>

44
00:07:30,173 --> 00:07:33,526
<i>showed their loyalty by raising regiments
of horse and foot</i>

45
00:07:33,551 --> 00:07:35,302
<i>to resist the invaders.</i>

46
00:07:37,055 --> 00:07:41,183
<i>Their scarlet coats and swaggering airs
filled Barry with envy.</i>

47
00:07:47,774 --> 00:07:51,443
Company, eyes right!

48
00:07:57,575 --> 00:07:59,618
<i>Brady Town sent a company to join...</i>

49
00:07:59,786 --> 00:08:03,872
<i>the Kilwangan Regiment,
of which John Quin was the Captain.</i>

50
00:08:07,043 --> 00:08:09,711
<i>The whole country was alive
with war's alarms...</i>

51
00:08:10,713 --> 00:08:13,882
<i>the three kingdoms ringing
with military music.</i>

52
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:21,598
At ready!

53
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:26,770
Present!

54
00:08:29,065 --> 00:08:30,107
Fire!

55
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:57,527
Redmond, what is the matter?

56
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:06,036
Nora, were you obliged to dance
five times with Captain Quin?

57
00:10:07,163 --> 00:10:09,623
I don't care a fig for Captain Quin.

58
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:14,211
He dances prettily to be sure,
and is a pleasant rattle of a man.

59
00:10:14,462 --> 00:10:16,588
He looks well in his regimental stool.

60
00:10:16,797 --> 00:10:19,382
He asked me to dance.
How could I refuse him?

61
00:10:19,634 --> 00:10:21,092
But you refused me.

62
00:10:21,385 --> 00:10:23,345
I can dance with you any day.

63
00:10:24,347 --> 00:10:28,350
To dance with your own cousin looks
as though I could find no other partner.

64
00:10:29,727 --> 00:10:34,033
Besides Redmond, Captain Quin is a man.

65
00:10:34,148 --> 00:10:37,835
You're only a boy and you
hadn't a penny in the world.

66
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,866
If ever I should meet him again, you will
find out who is the best man of the two.

67
00:10:41,906 --> 00:10:44,592
I'll fight him sword or
pistol, Captain as he is.

68
00:10:44,617 --> 00:10:46,159
Redmond, don't be so silly!

69
00:10:46,327 --> 00:10:47,619
I mean it Nora.

70
00:10:48,162 --> 00:10:51,414
But Captain Quin is already
known as a valiant soldier.

71
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,918
It is mighty well of you
to fight farmer's boys...

72
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:57,921
but to fight an Englishman
is a very different matter.

73
00:10:59,423 --> 00:11:01,424
You best have your
Englishman take you home.

74
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,343
Redmond!

75
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,513
<i>Barry resolved never to see Nora again.</i>

76
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:38,295
<i>But such resolutions,
steadfastly held for a whole week...</i>

77
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:41,756
<i>are abandoned in a few
moments of bleak despair.</i>

78
00:11:45,553 --> 00:11:50,140
No, Nora, no, except for you
and four others...

79
00:11:50,474 --> 00:11:54,102
I vow before all the gods my heart...

80
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:57,063
has never felt the soft flame.

81
00:11:58,232 --> 00:12:01,985
Ah, you men, you men, John...

82
00:12:02,987 --> 00:12:05,280
your passion's not equal to ours.

83
00:12:06,657 --> 00:12:09,159
We are like some plant I've read of.

84
00:12:10,202 --> 00:12:13,163
We bear but one flower and then we die.

85
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,167
You, you, you mean you...

86
00:12:17,376 --> 00:12:19,961
never felt such an inclination for another?

87
00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:23,840
Never, my John.
How can you ask such a question?

88
00:12:24,008 --> 00:12:25,342
Oh, darling Norelia!

89
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:31,973
<i>Nora was chaperoned
by her brothers Mick and Ulick...</i>

90
00:12:33,017 --> 00:12:35,352
<i>whose interests would be affected...</i>

91
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,813
<i>by the favourable outcome
of her affair with Quin.</i>

92
00:12:51,661 --> 00:12:53,787
Redmond, how nice to see you.

93
00:12:58,501 --> 00:12:59,542
Redmond!

94
00:13:01,087 --> 00:13:02,879
How could you do this to me?

95
00:13:03,631 --> 00:13:05,733
Redmond, in the name of
heavens, what's the matter?

96
00:13:05,758 --> 00:13:07,357
What are you talking about?

97
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:13,515
I think this might be an opportune moment
to return something to you.

98
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:16,893
I...

99
00:13:17,853 --> 00:13:19,312
Thank you, Redmond.

100
00:13:20,106 --> 00:13:22,023
I must have forgotten it.

101
00:13:23,275 --> 00:13:24,359
Yes, you did, Nora.

102
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:33,117
Captain Quin, may I have the honour of
introducing my cousin, Redmond Barry.

103
00:13:33,202 --> 00:13:35,412
Miss Brady, it would appear...

104
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:38,123
you both have something to
discuss in private with this young man.

105
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,583
Perhaps it would be
best for me to withdraw.

106
00:13:41,043 --> 00:13:44,170
Captain Quin, I have nothing
to discuss with my cousin in private.

107
00:13:44,964 --> 00:13:48,669
Miss Brady, it would appear you have
a great deal to discuss in private.

108
00:13:49,218 --> 00:13:53,757
Good heavens, Captain Quin, he is but a boy and
don't signify any more than my parrot or lapdog.

109
00:13:53,806 --> 00:13:54,889
Indeed!

110
00:13:55,057 --> 00:13:57,058
Are you then in the habit of giving...

111
00:13:57,393 --> 00:14:00,979
intimate articles of your clothing
to your parrot or lapdog?

112
00:14:01,731 --> 00:14:04,357
Mayn't I give a bit of ribbon
to my own cousin?

113
00:14:05,317 --> 00:14:06,818
You're perfectly welcome, miss.

114
00:14:07,396 --> 00:14:09,279
As many yards as you like.

115
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:15,076
When ladies make presents to gentlemen,
it is time for other gentlemen to retire.

116
00:14:15,137 --> 00:14:17,287
I have the honour to
wish you both a good day.

117
00:14:17,496 --> 00:14:18,538
Jack Quin!

118
00:14:19,248 --> 00:14:20,582
What's the matter here?

119
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,333
I'll tell you what it is, sir.

120
00:14:22,501 --> 00:14:25,128
I've had enough of Miss Brady here
and your Irish ways.

121
00:14:25,296 --> 00:14:26,337
Ain't used to them, sir.

122
00:14:26,505 --> 00:14:27,714
What is it?

123
00:14:27,882 --> 00:14:31,217
We'll accustom you to Irish ways,
or we'll adopt English ones.

124
00:14:31,552 --> 00:14:34,721
It is not the English way
for ladies to have two lovers.

125
00:14:35,306 --> 00:14:38,266
And so, Mr. Brady, I'll thank you
to pay me the sum you owe me.

126
00:14:38,601 --> 00:14:41,519
And I resign all claims
to this young lady.

127
00:14:41,937 --> 00:14:44,397
If she has a fancy with schoolboys,
let her take 'em, sir.

128
00:14:44,565 --> 00:14:45,607
Quin, you're joking!

129
00:14:45,775 --> 00:14:48,151
Ha. I never was more earnest.

130
00:14:50,404 --> 00:14:51,696
John, wait.

131
00:14:57,578 --> 00:14:59,871
Hiya for a meddling brat!

132
00:14:59,997 --> 00:15:01,998
Your hand is in everybody's pie!

133
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:07,842
What business had you to come quarrel in
here with a gentleman who has 1500 a year?

134
00:16:01,851 --> 00:16:04,102
Redmond, me boy, take a seat.

135
00:17:17,343 --> 00:17:20,345
Mrs. Brady and ladies, if you please.

136
00:17:22,264 --> 00:17:27,103
This is the sort of toast that is drunk
a great deal too seldom in my family...

137
00:17:27,144 --> 00:17:30,438
and you'll please to receive it
with all the honours.

138
00:17:30,689 --> 00:17:34,317
Here's to Captain and Mrs. John Quin
and long life to them.

139
00:17:40,032 --> 00:17:41,032
Go on.

140
00:17:41,617 --> 00:17:44,369
Kiss her, Jack,
for faith you've got a treasure.

141
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,437
Come on, Jack. Come on.

142
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,084
There's the man!

143
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,303
Here's to a long and happy life together.

144
00:18:02,721 --> 00:18:04,847
A long and happy life together.

145
00:18:05,516 --> 00:18:06,808
Thank you.

146
00:18:11,522 --> 00:18:12,563
Redmond!

147
00:18:23,659 --> 00:18:26,953
Here's my toast to you,
Captain John Quin.

148
00:18:30,082 --> 00:18:33,710
Redmond, how dare you behave like that
in my house!

149
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,504
Mrs. Brady, take the children out.

150
00:18:36,672 --> 00:18:39,340
Captain Quin, my dear
fellow, are you all right?

151
00:18:48,684 --> 00:18:52,020
In heaven's name,
what does all the row mean?

152
00:18:53,063 --> 00:18:54,313
The fact is, sir...

153
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:56,399
the young monkey's
fallen in love with Nora.

154
00:18:56,567 --> 00:18:59,610
He found herself and the Captain
mighty sweet in the garden today.

155
00:18:59,778 --> 00:19:01,863
And now he's for murdering Jack Quin.

156
00:19:02,778 --> 00:19:06,918
And I tell you what, Mr. Brady, I've been insulted grossly
in this house.

157
00:19:07,036 --> 00:19:09,929
I'm not at all satisfied
with these ways of going on.

158
00:19:09,997 --> 00:19:13,476
I'm an Englishman, I am!
And a man of property!

159
00:19:14,001 --> 00:19:16,294
And as for this impudent young swine...

160
00:19:16,754 --> 00:19:17,962
should be horsewhipped!

161
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,840
Mr. Quin can have satisfaction
any time he pleases...

162
00:19:21,008 --> 00:19:24,093
by calling on Redmond Barry,
Esquire of Barryville.

163
00:19:32,019 --> 00:19:33,819
I'll see the boy home.

164
00:19:41,737 --> 00:19:45,310
A pretty day's work of it
you made, Master Redmond.

165
00:19:46,158 --> 00:19:48,326
Knowing your uncle to be distressed
for money...

166
00:19:48,494 --> 00:19:52,789
and trying to break off a match which
will bring £1,500 a year into the family...

167
00:19:53,582 --> 00:19:58,211
Quin has promised to pay off the £4,000
which is bothering your uncle so.

168
00:19:59,296 --> 00:20:01,380
He takes a girl without a penny...

169
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:06,661
a girl that's flinging herself at the head of
every man in these parts, these 5 years past.

170
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,221
And missing them all!

171
00:20:09,431 --> 00:20:13,876
And you, a boy who ought to be attached
to your uncle as to your father...

172
00:20:13,936 --> 00:20:14,977
And so I am.

173
00:20:15,813 --> 00:20:18,606
And this is the return
you make for his kindness?

174
00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:21,526
Didn't he harbour you in his house
when your father died?

175
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:26,864
Hasn't he given you and your mother
rent free, a fine house of value to wander?

176
00:20:26,905 --> 00:20:29,742
Mark this, and come what will of it...

177
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:33,704
I will fight the man who pretends
the hand of Nora Brady.

178
00:20:34,414 --> 00:20:37,959
I'll follow him if it's into the church
and fight him there.

179
00:20:39,253 --> 00:20:41,712
I'll have his blood, or he'll have mine.

180
00:20:46,677 --> 00:20:48,386
Faith, and I believe ye!

181
00:20:49,346 --> 00:20:51,973
I never saw a lad more game in me life.

182
00:20:53,392 --> 00:20:54,976
Give me a kiss, me dear boy.

183
00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:00,064
You're after me own soul.

184
00:21:00,732 --> 00:21:06,278
As long as Jack Rogan lives, you
shall never want a friend or a second.

185
00:21:07,656 --> 00:21:10,950
Will you take my message to him?
Will you arrange a meeting?

186
00:21:13,787 --> 00:21:17,081
Well, if it must be, it must.

187
00:22:24,066 --> 00:22:27,735
Look here, Redmond, me boy,
this is a silly business.

188
00:22:28,862 --> 00:22:31,489
The girl will marry Quin, mark my words.

189
00:22:32,616 --> 00:22:35,409
And as sure as she does,
you'll forget her.

190
00:22:36,286 --> 00:22:40,248
You're but a boy and Quin is willing
to consider you as such.

191
00:22:42,042 --> 00:22:43,167
Isn't that right, Quin?

192
00:22:44,836 --> 00:22:46,504
Oh, mm-hm.

193
00:22:49,549 --> 00:22:51,634
Now, Dublin's a fine place.

194
00:22:52,761 --> 00:22:56,722
If you've a mind to ride there
and see the town for a month...

195
00:22:57,099 --> 00:22:59,725
here's ten guineas at your service.

196
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,938
Will that satisfy you, Captain Quin?

197
00:23:05,107 --> 00:23:08,442
Yes, if Mr. Barry will apologize
and go to Dublin...

198
00:23:09,027 --> 00:23:12,321
I will consider the whole affair
honourably settled.

199
00:23:18,912 --> 00:23:20,621
Say you're sorry, Redmond.

200
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:24,458
Come on, you can easily say that.

201
00:23:32,217 --> 00:23:33,467
I'm not sorry.

202
00:23:36,305 --> 00:23:37,972
And I'll not apologize.

203
00:23:41,184 --> 00:23:43,811
And I'd as soon go to Dublin as to hell.

204
00:23:52,195 --> 00:23:55,323
Well then. There's nothing else for it.

205
00:23:57,659 --> 00:23:58,993
God bless you, me boy.

206
00:24:03,749 --> 00:24:05,662
This isn't one of my pistols.

207
00:24:06,209 --> 00:24:08,210
It's all right, it's one of mine.

208
00:24:09,004 --> 00:24:11,922
Yours will serve, if it's needed,
for the next round.

209
00:24:15,093 --> 00:24:16,552
Good luck, Redmond.

210
00:24:29,107 --> 00:24:30,399
Gentlemen...

211
00:24:33,612 --> 00:24:35,112
cock your pistols.

212
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:50,169
Gentlemen...

213
00:24:52,506 --> 00:24:53,964
aim your pistols.

214
00:25:08,063 --> 00:25:09,105
One.

215
00:25:11,691 --> 00:25:12,733
Two.

216
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:16,362
Three.

217
00:25:26,873 --> 00:25:28,040
Is he dead?

218
00:25:32,504 --> 00:25:33,629
Quite dead.

219
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:42,680
This has been a sad day's work
for our family, Redmond Barry.

220
00:25:43,515 --> 00:25:46,348
And ye've robbed us of 1,500 a year.

221
00:25:46,726 --> 00:25:49,270
Now you'd better ride off
before the Police are up.

222
00:25:49,438 --> 00:25:52,022
They'd wind of this business
before we left Kilwangan.

223
00:25:53,358 --> 00:25:56,284
Come on, Redmond, I'll go home with you.

224
00:26:19,092 --> 00:26:21,677
<i>How different Barry's fate
might have been...</i>

225
00:26:22,304 --> 00:26:24,680
<i>had he not fallen in love
with Nora...</i>

226
00:26:25,056 --> 00:26:28,309
<i>and had he not flung the wine
in Captain Quin's face.</i>

227
00:26:29,186 --> 00:26:31,479
<i>But he was destined to be a wanderer.</i>

228
00:26:32,397 --> 00:26:36,317
<i>And the battle with Quin set him
on his travels at a very early age...</i>

229
00:26:37,486 --> 00:26:39,195
<i>as you shall soon see.</i>

230
00:26:39,446 --> 00:26:42,823
The boy must go into hiding
for a short time, anyway.

231
00:26:44,534 --> 00:26:46,243
Dublin is the best place for him to.

232
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:49,411
He can stay there
'til matters have blown over.

233
00:26:49,539 --> 00:26:52,791
But the child has never been
away from home before.

234
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:55,836
Wouldn't he be as safe here?

235
00:26:56,046 --> 00:26:58,881
I wish that were true, Aunt
Belle, now you know I do.

236
00:26:59,216 --> 00:27:03,209
But I'm afraid the Bailiffs may be
already on their way from Kilwangan.

237
00:27:03,887 --> 00:27:07,056
Now, Dublin is five days' ride
away from here.

238
00:27:07,307 --> 00:27:09,767
There's not a soul who'll know him there.

239
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:13,062
I don't want to harp on
unpleasant matters, you know that...

240
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,525
but you do know what can happen
to him if he's taken.

241
00:27:26,701 --> 00:27:28,077
I'll be all right.

242
00:27:34,834 --> 00:27:37,044
I'll be all right in Dublin, Mother.

243
00:28:08,535 --> 00:28:11,078
<i>No lad who has liberty
for the first time...</i>

244
00:28:11,246 --> 00:28:13,163
<i>and 20 guineas in his pocket...</i>

245
00:28:13,665 --> 00:28:14,957
<i>is very sad.</i>

246
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,086
<i>Barry rode towards Dublin
thinking not so much of...</i>

247
00:28:19,254 --> 00:28:22,548
<i>the kind mother left alone,
and of the home behind him...</i>

248
00:28:23,425 --> 00:28:26,719
<i>but of tomorrow
and all the wonders it would bring.</i>

249
00:28:40,191 --> 00:28:41,525
Excuse me, miss.

250
00:28:41,693 --> 00:28:43,527
Would it be possible to have
a drink of water?

251
00:28:43,695 --> 00:28:45,362
Yes, sir.

252
00:28:50,452 --> 00:28:52,202
Good day to you, young sir.

253
00:28:55,248 --> 00:28:56,290
Good day.

254
00:29:03,131 --> 00:29:04,965
Will you join us in a drink?

255
00:29:07,969 --> 00:29:09,470
No, thank you.

256
00:29:13,141 --> 00:29:15,142
Would you like something to eat?

257
00:29:17,687 --> 00:29:20,606
That's very kind of you,
but I have to be on my way.

258
00:29:27,197 --> 00:29:28,280
Thank you.

259
00:29:41,127 --> 00:29:42,294
Goodbye.

260
00:30:31,928 --> 00:30:33,429
Uh, excuse me, sir.

261
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,850
Good morning again, young sir.

262
00:30:42,313 --> 00:30:44,231
Don't even think about it.

263
00:30:47,026 --> 00:30:48,819
Get down off that horse.

264
00:30:56,035 --> 00:30:58,495
Raise your hands high
above your head, please.

265
00:30:59,831 --> 00:31:01,081
Come forward.

266
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:06,670
Stop.

267
00:31:11,092 --> 00:31:14,386
How do you do? I'm Captain Feeney.

268
00:31:17,724 --> 00:31:19,016
Captain Feeney!

269
00:31:19,267 --> 00:31:21,727
Captain Feeney, at your service.

270
00:31:22,771 --> 00:31:24,229
The Captain Feeney?

271
00:31:25,106 --> 00:31:26,231
None other.

272
00:31:26,858 --> 00:31:29,443
May I introduce you to my son... Seamus?

273
00:31:32,113 --> 00:31:33,405
How do you do?

274
00:31:33,573 --> 00:31:34,698
How do you do?

275
00:31:35,366 --> 00:31:37,868
To whom have I
the honour of speaking?

276
00:31:38,745 --> 00:31:40,412
My name's Redmond Barry.

277
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,289
How do you do, Mr. Barry?

278
00:31:43,124 --> 00:31:47,586
And now I'm afraid we must get onto the more
regrettable stage of our brief acquaintance.

279
00:31:47,796 --> 00:31:51,924
Turn around and keep your hands
high above your head, please.

280
00:32:26,376 --> 00:32:29,002
There must be 20 guineas
in gold here, Father.

281
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:31,516
Well, well, well.

282
00:32:31,569 --> 00:32:34,982
You seem to be a very well set up
young gentleman, sir.

283
00:32:35,635 --> 00:32:39,221
Captain Feeney, that's all the money
my mother had in the world.

284
00:32:39,389 --> 00:32:40,973
Mightn't I be allowed keep it?

285
00:32:41,307 --> 00:32:43,767
I'm just one step ahead
of the Law myself.

286
00:32:43,977 --> 00:32:48,355
I killed an English Officer in a duel, and I'm
on my way to Dublin until things cool down.

287
00:32:48,523 --> 00:32:50,102
Mr. Barry...

288
00:32:50,149 --> 00:32:53,378
in my profession
we hear many such stories.

289
00:32:53,403 --> 00:32:57,197
Yours is one of the most intriguing
and touching I've heard in many weeks.

290
00:32:57,615 --> 00:33:00,450
Nevertheless, I'm afraid
I cannot grant your request.

291
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,283
But, I'll tell you what I will do.

292
00:33:03,317 --> 00:33:05,904
I'll allow you to keep
those fine pair of boots,

293
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:09,410
which in normal circumstances
I would have for myself.

294
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:12,212
The next town is only five miles away.

295
00:33:12,672 --> 00:33:15,048
And I suggest you now start walking.

296
00:33:15,216 --> 00:33:17,217
Mightn't I be allowed to keep my horse?

297
00:33:17,719 --> 00:33:19,344
I would like to oblige you...

298
00:33:19,512 --> 00:33:23,891
but, people like us we must be able
to travel faster than our clients.

299
00:33:24,434 --> 00:33:25,893
Good day, young sir.

300
00:33:40,241 --> 00:33:42,743
You can put down your hands now,
Mr. Barry.

301
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:18,598
Gale's Regiment of Foot, commanded
by Lieutenant General Charles Gale...

302
00:34:18,738 --> 00:34:23,458
which has so gloriously distinguished
itself during the recent troubles...

303
00:34:23,534 --> 00:34:27,204
wants several men to supply
the places of those veterans...

304
00:34:27,372 --> 00:34:32,000
who have deserved to be pensioned
as lettermen, at one shilling a day.

305
00:34:33,002 --> 00:34:36,088
All clever young fellows
who are free and able...

306
00:34:36,381 --> 00:34:40,528
and are ambitious of becoming
gentlemen by bearing arms...

307
00:34:40,553 --> 00:34:44,388
are hereby invited to step up
and meet the Recruiting Officer...

308
00:34:44,931 --> 00:34:48,141
who promises that they shall meet
with every encouragement...

309
00:34:48,309 --> 00:34:51,603
that merit and good behaviour
can entitle them to.

310
00:34:52,271 --> 00:34:56,194
Those meeting the qualifications
will immediately receive...

311
00:34:56,234 --> 00:34:59,569
His Majesty's Royal Bounty
of one and a half guineas...

312
00:34:59,904 --> 00:35:02,948
with complete clothing, arms
and accoutrements.

313
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,743
King George and Old England forever.

314
00:35:12,291 --> 00:35:15,669
Left, left, left, right, left.

315
00:35:16,254 --> 00:35:19,673
Left, left, left, right, left.

316
00:35:19,924 --> 00:35:21,967
<i>For a young man in difficulty...</i>

317
00:35:22,301 --> 00:35:26,930
<i>who had killed a man in a duel and
was anxious to find refuge from the Law...</i>

318
00:35:27,473 --> 00:35:30,642
<i>the opportunity to earn distinction
in the European wars...</i>

319
00:35:30,977 --> 00:35:33,228
<i>seemed a great stroke of good fortune.</i>

320
00:35:34,188 --> 00:35:38,150
<i>And King George was too much in want of men
to heed from whence they came.</i>

321
00:35:57,962 --> 00:36:00,175
Hey, lad! Lad!

322
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,965
Lad!

323
00:36:02,383 --> 00:36:05,218
Can I have a new beaker?
This one is full of grease.

324
00:36:16,481 --> 00:36:20,817
Covered in grease! Give the gentleman
a towel and a basin of turtle soup.

325
00:36:55,728 --> 00:36:58,939
If you want to vex him,
ask him about his wife...

326
00:36:59,107 --> 00:37:01,191
the washerwoman, who beats him.

327
00:37:01,734 --> 00:37:05,654
Mr. Toole, is it a towel
of your wife's washing?

328
00:37:06,114 --> 00:37:08,573
They say she wipes your face
often with one.

329
00:37:10,368 --> 00:37:13,829
Ask him why he wouldn't see her
yesterday when she came to the camp.

330
00:37:14,163 --> 00:37:18,416
Mr. Toole, why did you hide so yesterday
when Mrs. Toole came to visit you?

331
00:37:18,668 --> 00:37:20,544
Afraid of getting your ears boxed?

332
00:37:26,092 --> 00:37:30,554
Gentlemen, gentlemen, you may fight it out
with fists if you choose.

333
00:37:31,389 --> 00:37:34,015
We'll form a square for that purpose.

334
00:37:45,361 --> 00:37:48,580
Gentlemen, step this way, please.

335
00:37:54,829 --> 00:37:55,996
Both shake hands.

336
00:37:57,373 --> 00:37:58,498
Shake hands.

337
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,126
Take your stance.

338
00:38:03,754 --> 00:38:05,881
No biting, kicking or scratching.

339
00:38:06,048 --> 00:38:08,633
The last man to remain standing
is the winner.

340
00:38:09,177 --> 00:38:12,262
Gentlemen, commence fighting, now!

341
00:40:31,819 --> 00:40:35,113
<i>Barry's training continued
at Dunley at the camp.</i>

342
00:40:35,364 --> 00:40:38,658
<i>And within a month he was transformed
into a tall and proper young soldier.</i>

343
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:45,222
<i>During this time the Regiment's strength
was steadily increased...</i>

344
00:40:45,249 --> 00:40:47,459
<i>by the arrival of other troops...</i>

345
00:40:47,752 --> 00:40:51,254
<i>in preparation for joining
their gallant armies fighting in Germany.</i>

346
00:40:53,966 --> 00:40:55,216
<i>One occasion...</i>

347
00:40:55,634 --> 00:41:00,627
<i>brought the welcome appearance of no
other than his second in the fatal duel...</i>

348
00:41:00,765 --> 00:41:02,140
<i>Captain Grogan.</i>

349
00:41:20,534 --> 00:41:24,600
It would have been better for all of us
if we'd known what had become of you.

350
00:41:25,706 --> 00:41:28,333
Didn't you think of writing
to your mother?

351
00:41:32,046 --> 00:41:33,171
Of course.

352
00:41:35,216 --> 00:41:37,842
But the shame I felt of losing
her money...

353
00:41:39,053 --> 00:41:41,221
my father's sword and pistols...

354
00:41:43,015 --> 00:41:44,808
I couldn't tell her.

355
00:41:46,477 --> 00:41:49,104
Your mother wouldn't care
a pin about those things.

356
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,189
You are her only concern.

357
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:55,156
Now you must sit down tonight
and write her a proper letter.

358
00:41:55,194 --> 00:41:59,060
And tell her that you're safe and well
and merry to brown Bess.

359
00:42:01,242 --> 00:42:02,283
I will.

360
00:42:10,751 --> 00:42:12,210
Is Miss Brady well?

361
00:42:17,842 --> 00:42:20,575
There are only six Miss Bradys now.

362
00:42:23,764 --> 00:42:25,890
Has something happened to Nora?

363
00:42:28,269 --> 00:42:31,722
She took on so about your going away...

364
00:42:32,356 --> 00:42:35,275
that she was obliged to
console herself with a husband.

365
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:39,237
She is now Mrs. John Quin.

366
00:42:43,284 --> 00:42:44,576
Mrs. John Quin?

367
00:42:46,287 --> 00:42:48,079
Was there another John Quin?

368
00:42:48,873 --> 00:42:49,873
No.

369
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:53,168
The very same one, me boy.
He recovered from his wound.

370
00:42:55,671 --> 00:43:00,977
The shot you hit him with was not likely to
hurt him, for it was only made of tow.

371
00:43:02,261 --> 00:43:03,303
Tow?

372
00:43:05,764 --> 00:43:10,124
Do you think the Bradys would let you kill
1500 a year out of the family?

373
00:43:11,729 --> 00:43:16,149
The plan of the duel was all arranged
in order to get you out of the way.

374
00:43:16,984 --> 00:43:19,611
For the cowardly Quin could never
be brought to marry...

375
00:43:20,112 --> 00:43:21,821
from fear of you.

376
00:43:21,989 --> 00:43:24,699
But hit him you certainly did, me lad.

377
00:43:25,534 --> 00:43:27,952
With a fine thick plugget of tow.

378
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:33,283
The fellow was so frightened,
that he was an hour in coming to.

379
00:43:36,754 --> 00:43:38,463
Are you in want of cash?

380
00:43:40,716 --> 00:43:45,522
You may draw on me. For I got a couple
of hundred out of your uncle from my share.

381
00:43:46,096 --> 00:43:48,640
While they lasts, you shall never want.

382
00:43:53,187 --> 00:43:57,857
<i>It would require a great philosopher
historian to explain the causes...</i>

383
00:43:58,025 --> 00:44:02,053
<i>of the famous Seven Years' War
in which Europe was engaged...</i>

384
00:44:02,112 --> 00:44:05,912
<i>to in which Barry's regiment
was now on its way to take part.</i>

385
00:44:06,492 --> 00:44:10,762
<i>Let it suffice to say,
that England and Prussia were allies...</i>

386
00:44:10,829 --> 00:44:16,215
<i>and at war against the French,
Swedes, the Russians and the Austrians.</i>

387
00:44:30,558 --> 00:44:32,308
<i>Barry's first taste of battle...</i>

388
00:44:32,476 --> 00:44:35,687
<i>was only a skirmish against
a small rearguard of Frenchmen...</i>

389
00:44:36,272 --> 00:44:38,856
<i>who occupied an orchard
beside a road...</i>

390
00:44:39,024 --> 00:44:43,144
<i>down which a few hours later the
English main force wished to pass.</i>

391
00:44:44,321 --> 00:44:47,240
<i>Though this encounter is not recorded
in any history books...</i>

392
00:44:48,117 --> 00:44:50,994
<i>it was memorable enough
for those who took part.</i>

393
00:47:12,594 --> 00:47:15,555
I've only a hundred guineas
left to give you...

394
00:47:16,265 --> 00:47:18,599
for I lost the rest at cards.

395
00:47:22,771 --> 00:47:25,940
Kiss me, me boy,
for we'll never meet again.

396
00:47:59,057 --> 00:48:04,017
<i>It is well to dream of glorious
war in a snug armchair at home.</i>

397
00:48:04,646 --> 00:48:07,648
<i>But it is a very different thing
to see it first-hand.</i>

398
00:48:09,151 --> 00:48:14,651
<i>And after the death of his friend, Barry's thoughts
turned from those of military glory...</i>

399
00:48:14,865 --> 00:48:17,450
<i>to those of finding a way
to escape the Service...</i>

400
00:48:17,618 --> 00:48:20,286
<i>to which he was now
tied for another six years.</i>

401
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:37,303
<i>Gentlemen may talk
of the Age of Chivalry...</i>

402
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:42,308
<i>but remember the ploughmen,
poachers and pickpockets whom they lead.</i>

403
00:48:43,393 --> 00:48:47,730
<i>It is with these sad instruments
that your great warriors and kings...</i>

404
00:48:48,357 --> 00:48:51,317
<i>have been doing their murderous work
in the world.</i>

405
00:49:01,203 --> 00:49:05,088
<i>A young man could hardly have fallen
into worse circumstances...</i>

406
00:49:05,113 --> 00:49:07,531
<i>than those in which Barry found himself.</i>

407
00:49:08,126 --> 00:49:11,921
<i>But fate did not intend he should
remain long an English soldier.</i>

408
00:49:12,756 --> 00:49:14,340
<i>An accident occurred...</i>

409
00:49:14,633 --> 00:49:18,135
<i>which took him out of the Service
in a rather singular manner.</i>

410
00:49:46,832 --> 00:49:50,793
Freddie, I hope you won't be too angry
with me, but...

411
00:49:51,587 --> 00:49:55,214
I've got something to tell you
which you won't be happy about.

412
00:49:55,424 --> 00:49:57,133
Oh? What is it?

413
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:01,053
First, you've got to promise me
you'll keep your temper.

414
00:50:02,222 --> 00:50:06,267
Jonathan, don't be such a silly ass!
You're making a great big mystery of it.

415
00:50:07,019 --> 00:50:08,519
What is going on?

416
00:50:09,813 --> 00:50:11,772
I I'm afraid I shall have to go away again.

417
00:50:12,566 --> 00:50:14,191
Only for about a fortnight.

418
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:17,906
Oh, my God, you're not serious?

419
00:50:18,572 --> 00:50:22,033
Yes, I'm afraid I am. There's
nothing I can do about it.

420
00:50:23,243 --> 00:50:24,702
Where are you going to this time?

421
00:50:25,203 --> 00:50:29,540
I'm going to Bremen, carrying important
messages and dispatches to Prince Henry.

422
00:50:30,626 --> 00:50:34,837
But Jonathan you promised me last time it
would be once and for all and never again.

423
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:38,966
Yes I know. And promise you I've
kept my part of the bargain, but...

424
00:50:39,718 --> 00:50:43,095
Pontersby insists I'm the only one on his
staff who can be entrusted with the trip.

425
00:50:43,263 --> 00:50:45,765
Here was the opportunity
to escape from the Army...

426
00:50:45,933 --> 00:50:47,558
for which he had been searching.

427
00:50:49,144 --> 00:50:53,940
It was only a few miles through the forest to
the area occupied by their Prussian allies...

428
00:50:55,192 --> 00:50:57,693
where this Officer's uniform
and papers...

429
00:50:57,861 --> 00:51:00,363
should allow him to travel
without suspicion...

430
00:51:00,864 --> 00:51:04,867
and stay ahead of the news of his
desertion which would be sure to follow.

431
00:51:05,911 --> 00:51:08,204
Then, we'll have little time together.

432
00:51:09,331 --> 00:51:10,790
Are you cross with me?

433
00:51:12,417 --> 00:51:16,212
Damn you. Damn you, you know I
can't stay cross with you for long.

434
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:19,799
Oh, Jonathan...

435
00:51:20,676 --> 00:51:24,136
It's times like this that I realize
how much I care for you...

436
00:51:24,513 --> 00:51:27,723
and how impossibly empty
life would be without you.

437
00:51:28,225 --> 00:51:29,392
Frederick!

438
00:51:53,583 --> 00:51:58,838
<i>Barry was glad to see the blue and
white uniforms of the Prussian Infantry.</i>

439
00:51:59,965 --> 00:52:04,093
<i>They showed him that he was out of
the land occupied by his own countrymen.</i>

440
00:52:10,726 --> 00:52:13,185
<i>His intention was to make for Holland...</i>

441
00:52:13,353 --> 00:52:16,772
<i>almost the only neutral country
of Europe, in those times...</i>

442
00:52:17,399 --> 00:52:19,900
<i>and thence to get a passage home, somehow.</i>

443
00:52:21,069 --> 00:52:22,403
<i>As he rode away...</i>

444
00:52:22,904 --> 00:52:25,865
<i>Barry felt once more that
he was in his proper sphere.</i>

445
00:52:26,575 --> 00:52:30,578
<i>And determined never again
to fall from the rank of a gentleman.</i>

446
00:52:49,806 --> 00:52:51,182
Excuse me, miss.

447
00:52:52,267 --> 00:52:53,309
Yes.

448
00:52:53,894 --> 00:52:54,935
Good day.

449
00:52:55,771 --> 00:52:56,812
Good day.

450
00:52:58,815 --> 00:53:00,399
Do you speak English?

451
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:05,071
I'm speaking little.

452
00:53:08,575 --> 00:53:12,328
I have not eaten anything all day, no food.

453
00:53:13,622 --> 00:53:16,916
Is there an inn nearby
where I might have a meal?

454
00:53:19,044 --> 00:53:21,087
No... I don't think so.

455
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:27,510
There is nothing to eat
something since Grünberg.

456
00:53:31,098 --> 00:53:32,640
Do you live near here?

457
00:53:36,061 --> 00:53:37,103
Yes.

458
00:53:40,607 --> 00:53:45,773
Would you... feed me? Something to eat.
I'd be happy to pay you.

459
00:53:49,449 --> 00:53:50,658
I think so.

460
00:54:16,017 --> 00:54:17,643
Is it a little boy or a little girl?

461
00:54:18,937 --> 00:54:19,979
A boy.

462
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:24,483
And what's his name?

463
00:54:24,693 --> 00:54:25,734
Peter.

464
00:54:27,112 --> 00:54:28,404
How old is Peter?

465
00:54:29,656 --> 00:54:31,157
He's one year sold.

466
00:54:34,953 --> 00:54:36,620
Where might Peter's father be?

467
00:54:39,124 --> 00:54:40,916
You mean, where he is?

468
00:54:43,003 --> 00:54:44,044
Yes.

469
00:54:45,463 --> 00:54:46,755
He's in the war.

470
00:54:51,845 --> 00:54:53,554
And how long has he been gone?

471
00:54:56,558 --> 00:54:59,391
Sorry... I didn't understand.

472
00:55:00,068 --> 00:55:01,110
What?

473
00:55:02,221 --> 00:55:04,361
How long has he been gone?

474
00:55:04,983 --> 00:55:06,650
Oh! A long time.

475
00:55:08,361 --> 00:55:09,987
Since springtime.

476
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:18,412
It must be hard for you to be alone.

477
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,584
It is.

478
00:55:29,382 --> 00:55:32,676
It must be very danger
for you to be in the war.

479
00:55:37,974 --> 00:55:40,100
I'm an officer and must do my duty.

480
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:52,383
You are sometimes...

481
00:55:52,447 --> 00:55:53,739
lonely?

482
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:57,785
Sometimes.

483
00:56:15,345 --> 00:56:17,930
What did you say. What's your name?

484
00:56:20,183 --> 00:56:21,684
Lieutenant Fakenham.

485
00:56:22,811 --> 00:56:24,270
No, I mean...

486
00:56:25,355 --> 00:56:28,588
what is the name before Fakenham?

487
00:56:29,859 --> 00:56:32,268
- My first name?
- Yes.

488
00:56:32,612 --> 00:56:33,654
Jonathan.

489
00:56:35,865 --> 00:56:36,907
Jonathan?

490
00:56:39,035 --> 00:56:40,411
Would you like...

491
00:56:40,578 --> 00:56:41,996
to stay with me?

492
00:56:42,706 --> 00:56:46,391
For a few days, or sometimes?

493
00:56:49,796 --> 00:56:51,505
That would be very nice.

494
00:57:22,495 --> 00:57:24,621
Goodbye, my beautiful Lischen.

495
00:57:31,546 --> 00:57:34,131
Goodbye, Redmond.

496
00:57:37,218 --> 00:57:38,344
I love you.

497
00:57:38,553 --> 00:57:39,720
I love you.

498
00:57:41,681 --> 00:57:43,140
Look after yourself.

499
00:57:47,771 --> 00:57:49,104
God be with you.

500
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:57,988
<i>A lady who sets her heart
upon a lad in uniform...</i>

501
00:57:58,907 --> 00:58:01,909
<i>must prepare to change lovers
pretty quickly...</i>

502
00:58:02,077 --> 00:58:04,244
<i>or her life will be but a sad one.</i>

503
00:58:06,247 --> 00:58:10,084
<i>This heart of Lischen's was like
many a neighbouring town...</i>

504
00:58:11,294 --> 00:58:15,798
<i>and had been stormed and occupied
several times before Barry came to invest it.</i>

505
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:44,787
<i>During the five years which
the war had now lasted...</i>

506
00:58:44,828 --> 00:58:49,289
<i>the great and illustrious Frederick had
so exhausted the males of his kingdom...</i>

507
00:58:49,833 --> 00:58:52,519
<i>that he had to employ
scores of recruiters...</i>

508
00:58:52,544 --> 00:58:56,147
<i>who would hesitate at no crime,
including kidnapping...</i>

509
00:58:56,172 --> 00:59:01,105
<i>to keep supplied those brilliant
regiments of his with food for powder.</i>

510
00:59:33,209 --> 00:59:34,585
Good evening, sir.

511
00:59:36,442 --> 00:59:40,756
I'm Captain Potzdorf. May I ask to
whom have I the honour of speaking?

512
00:59:41,759 --> 00:59:45,554
Good evening. I'm Lieutenant Fakenham,
Gale's Regiment of Foot.

513
00:59:45,972 --> 00:59:47,431
Pleased to meet you.

514
00:59:48,933 --> 00:59:51,059
Can we be of some
assistance to you, Lieutenant?

515
00:59:52,263 --> 00:59:56,308
Thank you Captain, but I must continue
on my way. I'm carrying urgent dispatches.

516
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,223
May I ask your destination?

517
01:00:01,063 --> 01:00:02,357
I'm travelling to Bremen.

518
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,620
To Bremen? Then you're
obviously lost, Lieutenant.

519
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:09,745
Because Bremen is in
the opposite direction.

520
01:00:10,055 --> 01:00:11,055
Are you sure, Captain?

521
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:12,122
Yes.

522
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,501
Wouldn't you know it!

523
01:00:16,252 --> 01:00:21,048
My departure was so hastily organised that
my orderly forgot to prepare proper maps of the area.

524
01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:23,842
Of course I understand.

525
01:00:26,471 --> 01:00:29,777
Please, do not be offended, Lieutenant...

526
01:00:30,099 --> 01:00:32,684
but may I ask whether you are
carrying your identity papers?

527
01:00:34,938 --> 01:00:36,230
Yes, of course I am.

528
01:00:37,941 --> 01:00:39,233
Would you allow me to see them?

529
01:00:42,529 --> 01:00:43,612
Of course.

530
01:00:48,326 --> 01:00:49,368
Here you are.

531
01:00:49,536 --> 01:00:50,577
Thank you very much.

532
01:01:04,592 --> 01:01:08,303
Thank you very much, Lieutenant, I hope
I haven't inconvenienced you in any way.

533
01:01:09,264 --> 01:01:10,430
Not at all.

534
01:01:12,809 --> 01:01:15,602
Now that we are riding
in the same direction...

535
01:01:16,521 --> 01:01:21,417
I'd be very honoured if you'd allow me to
offer you a meal and a bed for the night...

536
01:01:21,442 --> 01:01:23,610
and a proper map to be
drawn up for the journey?

537
01:01:26,155 --> 01:01:30,659
That's extremely kind of you, Captain,
and I'd be honoured to accept your invitation.

538
01:01:53,683 --> 01:01:56,310
<i>Barry was treated with great civility...</i>

539
01:01:57,145 --> 01:01:59,813
<i>and was asked a thousand questions
about England,</i>

540
01:02:00,315 --> 01:02:05,101
<i>which he answered as best he could,
inventing a thousand stories.</i>

541
01:02:06,362 --> 01:02:08,363
<i>He described the King and Ministers...</i>

542
01:02:09,282 --> 01:02:12,701
<i>boasted that the British Ambassador
in Berlin was his uncle...</i>

543
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:16,079
<i>and even offered Captain Potzdorf
a letter of introduction.</i>

544
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:20,667
<i>His host seemed quite satisfied
with these stories.</i>

545
01:02:21,502 --> 01:02:24,910
<i>But at the same time
he led Barry on</i>

546
01:02:24,935 --> 01:02:28,658
<i>with a skilful combination of
questions and flattery.</i>

547
01:02:28,843 --> 01:02:32,696
You will have to pardon me, I know
so little about your country of England...

548
01:02:33,056 --> 01:02:35,992
except that you are
the bravest nation in the world...

549
01:02:36,017 --> 01:02:39,349
and that we are really fortunate
to have such allies.

550
01:02:41,022 --> 01:02:42,606
Lieutenant Fakenham...

551
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:47,388
let us drink to the friendship
of our two great nations.

552
01:02:48,996 --> 01:02:50,955
To our two great nations.

553
01:03:10,927 --> 01:03:14,888
Aren't you lucky,
going to Bremen tomorrow?

554
01:03:16,349 --> 01:03:19,142
I know one of the loveliest women
in Europe there.

555
01:03:21,396 --> 01:03:23,355
May I ask you to take a letter to her?

556
01:03:25,149 --> 01:03:26,274
Certainly.

557
01:03:26,651 --> 01:03:30,028
By the way, to whom are you carrying
your dispatches?

558
01:03:33,324 --> 01:03:34,741
General Williamson.

559
01:03:37,370 --> 01:03:38,578
General Williamson?

560
01:03:38,746 --> 01:03:39,788
Yes.

561
01:03:41,249 --> 01:03:44,368
General Percival Williamson?

562
01:03:46,254 --> 01:03:47,504
Yes, the same.

563
01:03:54,345 --> 01:03:55,887
Sergeant.

564
01:04:00,476 --> 01:04:02,269
This man is under arrest.

565
01:04:06,691 --> 01:04:10,750
Under arrest? Captain Potzdorf, sir...

566
01:04:10,778 --> 01:04:12,571
I'm a British Officer.

567
01:04:13,197 --> 01:04:16,230
You are a liar. You're an imposter.

568
01:04:17,076 --> 01:04:18,535
You're a deserter.

569
01:04:19,871 --> 01:04:23,874
I suspected you this morning and your
lies and folly have confirmed this to me.

570
01:04:25,084 --> 01:04:29,212
You pretend to carry dispatches to a
General, who has been dead these ten months.

571
01:04:30,148 --> 01:04:33,177
You say your uncle is the
British Ambassador in Berlin...

572
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:36,174
with the ridiculous name of O'Grady.

573
01:04:37,555 --> 01:04:41,614
Now, will you join and take
the bounty sir, or be given up?

574
01:04:45,772 --> 01:04:47,063
I volunteer.

575
01:04:50,902 --> 01:04:54,696
<i>The Prussian Service
was considerably worse than the English.</i>

576
01:04:55,907 --> 01:04:59,367
<i>The life that a Private Soldier led
was a frightful one.</i>

577
01:05:01,746 --> 01:05:05,874
<i>Punishment was incessant.
And every Officer had the right to inflict it.</i>

578
01:05:08,503 --> 01:05:12,297
<i>The gauntlet was the most common penalty
for minor offences.</i>

579
01:05:13,466 --> 01:05:17,844
<i>More serious ones were punishable
by mutilation or death.</i>

580
01:05:26,938 --> 01:05:30,708
<i>At the close of the Seven Years' War
the army...</i>

581
01:05:30,733 --> 01:05:36,029
<i>so renowned for its disciplined valour,
was officered by native Prussians.</i>

582
01:05:36,823 --> 01:05:38,949
<i>But it was composed for the most part...</i>

583
01:05:39,659 --> 01:05:42,285
<i>of men from the lowest levels
of humanity...</i>

584
01:05:42,995 --> 01:05:46,414
<i>hired or stolen
from almost every nation in Europe.</i>

585
01:05:48,292 --> 01:05:52,754
<i>Thus, Barry fell into the worst
of courses and company...</i>

586
01:05:54,382 --> 01:05:58,510
<i>and was soon very far advanced in
the science of every kind of misconduct.</i>

587
01:07:48,259 --> 01:07:49,325
Help!

588
01:07:52,744 --> 01:07:54,497
Get me out of here.

589
01:07:57,129 --> 01:07:58,213
Help.

590
01:07:58,965 --> 01:08:00,674
Get me out of here.

591
01:09:17,376 --> 01:09:22,565
<i>The Colonel's speech declared that
the King had expressed his satisfaction...</i>

592
01:09:22,590 --> 01:09:25,717
<i>with the conduct of the Regiment
at the Battle of Audorf...</i>

593
01:09:26,093 --> 01:09:31,782
<i>and with the bravery of Corporal Redmond
Barry's in rescuing Captain Potzdorf...</i>

594
01:09:31,807 --> 01:09:35,810
<i>was to be specially rewarded
with the sum of two Frederick d'or.</i>

595
01:09:41,317 --> 01:09:44,444
Corporal Barry, eight paces forward...

596
01:09:45,613 --> 01:09:46,654
march!

597
01:09:59,168 --> 01:10:00,460
Corporal Barry.

598
01:10:05,216 --> 01:10:08,343
You're a gallant soldier, and have
evidently come of good stock...

599
01:10:08,886 --> 01:10:11,346
but you're idle and unprincipled.

600
01:10:12,014 --> 01:10:14,057
You've done a great
deal of harm to the men.

601
01:10:14,903 --> 01:10:19,447
And for all your talents and bravery,
I'm sure you'll come to no good.

602
01:10:21,899 --> 01:10:24,567
I hope the Colonel Guideau is
mistaken regarding my character.

603
01:10:25,694 --> 01:10:30,156
I have fallen into bad company it is true,
but I've only done as other soldiers have done.

604
01:10:30,574 --> 01:10:34,067
And above all, I never had a kind friend
or protector before...

605
01:10:34,092 --> 01:10:36,886
to show that I was worthy
of better things.

606
01:10:37,414 --> 01:10:40,750
The Colonel may say I'm a ruined lad,
and send me to the Devil.

607
01:10:41,001 --> 01:10:44,254
But be sure of this. I would go to the
Devil to serve the Regiment.

608
01:10:48,151 --> 01:10:51,491
Corporal Barry, fall in.

609
01:11:01,438 --> 01:11:06,317
<i>The war was soon ended and Barry's
regiment was garrisoned in the Capital.</i>

610
01:11:08,404 --> 01:11:13,741
<i>He had, for some time now, ingratiated
himself considerably with Captain Potzdorf...</i>

611
01:11:14,577 --> 01:11:17,662
<i>whose confidence in him
was about to bring its reward.</i>

612
01:11:27,464 --> 01:11:28,756
Good morning, Redmond.

613
01:11:28,924 --> 01:11:30,508
Good morning, Captain Potzdorf.

614
01:11:31,677 --> 01:11:35,680
I should like you to meet my uncle,
the Minister of Police. Herr from Potzdorf.

615
01:11:36,932 --> 01:11:38,892
Good morning, Herr Minister.

616
01:11:41,103 --> 01:11:42,270
Redmond...

617
01:11:42,438 --> 01:11:46,900
I've spoken to the Minister regarding
your services and your fortune is made.

618
01:11:47,443 --> 01:11:49,444
We shall get you out of the Army...

619
01:11:49,612 --> 01:11:53,239
appoint you to the Police Bureau,
and, in time...

620
01:11:54,241 --> 01:11:58,036
we'll allow you to move in a better sphere than
that which fortune has hitherto placed you.

621
01:11:59,788 --> 01:12:01,247
Thank you, Captain Potzdorf.

622
01:12:03,774 --> 01:12:09,672
Redmond, your loyalty to me and your service
to the Regiment has pleased me very well.

623
01:12:11,425 --> 01:12:15,605
And now there is another occasion on
which you may make yourself useful to us.

624
01:12:16,618 --> 01:12:18,077
And if you succeed...

625
01:12:18,682 --> 01:12:19,974
depend on it...

626
01:12:20,517 --> 01:12:22,268
your reward will be secure.

627
01:12:24,104 --> 01:12:26,337
I'll do the best I can, sir.

628
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:40,387
There's lately come to Berlin a gentleman
in the service of the Empress Queen of Austria.

629
01:12:40,412 --> 01:12:44,165
He calls himself
the Chevalier de Balibari.

630
01:12:44,833 --> 01:12:47,502
He appears to follow the
profession of a gambler.

631
01:12:48,796 --> 01:12:50,171
He's a libertine:

632
01:12:50,965 --> 01:12:54,109
Fond of women, of good food...

633
01:12:54,134 --> 01:12:56,094
polished, obliging.

634
01:12:58,305 --> 01:13:00,765
He speaks French and German indifferently.

635
01:13:01,934 --> 01:13:06,147
But we have some reason to fancy
that this Monsieur de Balibari...

636
01:13:06,647 --> 01:13:09,232
is a native of your country of Ireland.

637
01:13:11,318 --> 01:13:14,971
And that he has come here as a spy.

638
01:13:25,499 --> 01:13:27,810
Naturally your knowledge of English...

639
01:13:27,835 --> 01:13:31,296
makes you an ideal choice
to go into his service...

640
01:13:32,298 --> 01:13:34,924
and to find out for us
whether or not he is a spy.

641
01:13:38,137 --> 01:13:40,430
Does this assignment interest you?

642
01:13:42,391 --> 01:13:46,686
You may be certain, Herr Minister, I'm interested
in anything that can be of service to yourself...

643
01:13:46,854 --> 01:13:48,521
and to Captain Potzdorf.

644
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:02,660
Of course you will not
know a word of English.

645
01:14:03,954 --> 01:14:09,954
And if the Chevalier asks as to the particularity
of your accent, say you are a Hungarian.

646
01:14:10,044 --> 01:14:11,669
You served in the war.

647
01:14:12,171 --> 01:14:16,037
You left the army on account
of weakness in the loins...

648
01:14:16,842 --> 01:14:20,136
you then served Monsieur de Quellenberg
for two years.

649
01:14:20,846 --> 01:14:24,640
He's now with the Army in Silesia, but
you'll have a certificate signed by him.

650
01:14:49,833 --> 01:14:51,542
Good morning, Your Honour.

651
01:15:10,460 --> 01:15:14,187
So you are the young man
recommended by Seebach.

652
01:15:15,773 --> 01:15:19,234
Yes, Your Honour,
here are my credentials.

653
01:15:29,706 --> 01:15:32,299
Your name is Lazlo Zilagy?

654
01:15:34,878 --> 01:15:36,866
Yes, Your Honour.

655
01:15:39,341 --> 01:15:42,801
Monsieur de Quellenberg
recommends you highly.

656
01:15:44,763 --> 01:15:47,443
Monsieur is a very good man.

657
01:15:55,190 --> 01:15:57,256
<i>It was very imprudent of him...</i>

658
01:15:57,734 --> 01:16:01,223
<i>but when Barry saw
the splendour of the Chevalier's appearance...</i>

659
01:16:01,697 --> 01:16:03,364
<i>the nobleness of his manner...</i>

660
01:16:03,907 --> 01:16:06,701
<i>he felt it impossible to
keep disguise with him.</i>

661
01:16:08,537 --> 01:16:10,705
<i>Those who have never
been out of their country...</i>

662
01:16:11,457 --> 01:16:14,917
<i>know little what it is to hear
a friendly voice in captivity...</i>

663
01:16:16,044 --> 01:16:19,830
<i>and as many a man who will
not understand the cause...</i>

664
01:16:19,882 --> 01:16:23,009
<i>of the burst of feeling which
was now about to take place.</i>

665
01:16:26,555 --> 01:16:28,723
You seem the right one to me.

666
01:16:32,352 --> 01:16:33,978
Thank you, Your Honour.

667
01:16:41,083 --> 01:16:42,710
Are you ill?

668
01:16:48,243 --> 01:16:49,243
Sir...

669
01:16:49,995 --> 01:16:52,705
I have a confession to make to you.

670
01:16:54,291 --> 01:16:55,625
I'm an Irishman.

671
01:16:57,044 --> 01:16:58,753
And my name is Redmond Barry.

672
01:17:02,257 --> 01:17:05,730
I was abducted into the
Prussian Army two years ago.

673
01:17:06,428 --> 01:17:08,763
Now I've been put into your service...

674
01:17:09,598 --> 01:17:14,227
by my Captain Potzdorf
and his uncle, the Minister of Police...

675
01:17:17,940 --> 01:17:22,026
to serve as a watch
upon your... actions...

676
01:17:23,662 --> 01:17:28,195
and to give information to the same court.

677
01:17:48,947 --> 01:17:52,241
<i>The Chevalier was as much affected as Barry...</i>

678
01:17:52,266 --> 01:17:54,308
<i>at thus finding one of his countrymen.</i>

679
01:17:55,269 --> 01:17:58,005
<i>For he too was an exile from home.</i>

680
01:17:58,397 --> 01:18:00,690
<i>And a friendly voice, a look...</i>

681
01:18:01,608 --> 01:18:04,569
<i>brought the old country
back to his memory again.</i>

682
01:18:08,687 --> 01:18:12,087
He goes to church regularly.
He's very religious.

683
01:18:12,285 --> 01:18:15,625
And after hearing mass he
comes home for breakfast.

684
01:18:19,436 --> 01:18:21,812
He then takes an airing in his carriage.

685
01:18:21,837 --> 01:18:26,275
<i>Barry presented his reports
regularly at the Minister's office.</i>

686
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:30,793
<i>The details were arranged between
him and the Chevalier beforehand.</i>

687
01:18:31,438 --> 01:18:35,123
<i>He was instructed, and it
is always far the best way...</i>

688
01:18:35,148 --> 01:18:38,421
<i>to tell as much truth as his story
would possibly bear.</i>

689
01:18:39,605 --> 01:18:43,899
<i>It would be seen that the information
he gave was very minute and accurate...</i>

690
01:18:44,443 --> 01:18:46,277
<i>though not very important.</i>

691
01:18:47,487 --> 01:18:49,572
But who does not acknowledge him.

692
01:19:07,716 --> 01:19:09,508
Wine or punch, Your Honour?

693
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:11,302
Wine.

694
01:19:12,387 --> 01:19:16,140
<i>It was agreed that Barry
should keep his character of valet.</i>

695
01:19:17,351 --> 01:19:21,145
<i>That in the presence of strangers,
he should not know a word of English.</i>

696
01:19:22,195 --> 01:19:25,055
<i>And that he should keep
a lookout on the trumps</i>

697
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:27,834
<i>when serving the
champagne and punch about.</i>

698
01:19:28,987 --> 01:19:31,273
<i>And having a remarkably fine eyesight...</i>

699
01:19:31,531 --> 01:19:33,324
<i>and a natural aptitude...</i>

700
01:19:34,326 --> 01:19:37,912
<i>he was speedily able to give
his dear patron much assistance...</i>

701
01:19:38,205 --> 01:19:40,998
<i>against his opponents
at the green table.</i>

702
01:19:42,626 --> 01:19:45,753
<i>If, for instance, he wiped
the table with a napkin...</i>

703
01:19:46,254 --> 01:19:48,839
<i>it was to show the enemy was strong in diamonds.</i>

704
01:19:49,841 --> 01:19:53,094
<i>If he adjusted a chair it meant ace king.</i>

705
01:19:53,261 --> 01:19:56,407
<i>If he said, "Punch or wine, My Lord?"...</i>

706
01:19:56,432 --> 01:19:59,058
<i>hearts were meant, and so forth.</i>

707
01:20:11,071 --> 01:20:12,822
<i>The Prince of Tübingen...</i>

708
01:20:12,989 --> 01:20:16,659
<i>was a nobleman who had intimate connections
with the Great Frederick...</i>

709
01:20:18,328 --> 01:20:22,430
<i>was passionately fond of play
as indeed were the gentlemen...</i>

710
01:20:22,457 --> 01:20:24,458
<i>of almost all the Courts of Europe.</i>

711
01:20:24,668 --> 01:20:27,878
You owe 15,500 Frederick d'or.

712
01:21:02,456 --> 01:21:03,581
Chevalier...

713
01:21:07,586 --> 01:21:09,503
though I cannot say how...

714
01:21:11,173 --> 01:21:13,340
I believe you have cheated me.

715
01:21:21,475 --> 01:21:23,559
I deny Your Grace's accusation...

716
01:21:24,352 --> 01:21:27,146
and beg you to say
how you have been cheated.

717
01:21:29,691 --> 01:21:30,858
I don't know.

718
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:33,611
But I believe I have been.

719
01:21:35,781 --> 01:21:39,992
Your Grace owes me
15,500 Frederick d'or...

720
01:21:40,994 --> 01:21:42,995
which I have honourably won.

721
01:21:45,248 --> 01:21:46,373
Chevalier...

722
01:21:49,002 --> 01:21:52,935
if you will have your money now
you must fight for it.

723
01:21:54,716 --> 01:21:56,425
If you will be patient...

724
01:21:57,719 --> 01:22:00,429
maybe I will pay you something
another time.

725
01:22:04,351 --> 01:22:09,706
Your Grace, if I am to be so tame
as to take this...

726
01:22:09,731 --> 01:22:13,108
then I must give up an honourable
and lucrative occupation.

727
01:22:15,153 --> 01:22:17,321
I have said all there is to be said.

728
01:22:18,740 --> 01:22:22,519
I am at your disposal
for whatever purposes you wish.

729
01:22:24,371 --> 01:22:25,538
Good night.

730
01:22:47,811 --> 01:22:49,562
Was the Prince cheated?

731
01:22:52,065 --> 01:22:55,860
In as far as I am able to tell of
such things, Herr Minister, no.

732
01:22:56,236 --> 01:22:58,404
I believe the Chevalier
won the money fairly.

733
01:23:02,909 --> 01:23:05,119
What are the Chevalier's intentions?

734
01:23:06,288 --> 01:23:07,496
I'm not sure.

735
01:23:08,039 --> 01:23:12,501
The Prince told him quite clearly that if he
wished to have his money he'd have to fight for it.

736
01:23:16,047 --> 01:23:18,757
A meeting with the Prince of Türbingen is impossible.

737
01:23:22,888 --> 01:23:25,306
The Prince has left him only that choice.

738
01:23:50,707 --> 01:23:52,416
Now.

739
01:23:52,584 --> 01:23:57,224
Will you be able to return here tomorrow
without arousing suspicion?

740
01:23:58,506 --> 01:24:01,606
I know they won't allow a meeting
with the Prince.

741
01:24:01,646 --> 01:24:06,066
But if I say that, do you know any reason
why he'll pay me the money he owes me?

742
01:24:07,641 --> 01:24:10,768
You must tell them I intend
to demand satisfaction.

743
01:24:11,895 --> 01:24:14,581
Don't look so downcast, my boy.

744
01:24:14,606 --> 01:24:19,199
There's no harm they can do to me, my friends
in the Austrian Embassy will see to that.

745
01:24:19,235 --> 01:24:24,312
The worst they can do is send me
out of this dreary country of theirs.

746
01:24:24,866 --> 01:24:27,826
And if they should, make your mind easy...

747
01:24:28,745 --> 01:24:30,746
you shall not be left behind.

748
01:24:31,414 --> 01:24:32,957
Have no fear of that.

749
01:24:35,126 --> 01:24:38,921
The King has determined to send
the Chevalier out of the country.

750
01:24:40,048 --> 01:24:42,954
Has he already demanded satisfaction?

751
01:24:44,302 --> 01:24:47,994
Not yet, Herr Minister,
but I believe he intends to...

752
01:24:48,598 --> 01:24:49,974
possibly today.

753
01:24:50,976 --> 01:24:53,018
Then this must be done tomorrow.

754
01:24:53,478 --> 01:24:55,437
All the arrangements are made.

755
01:24:56,711 --> 01:24:57,971
Redmond.

756
01:25:00,527 --> 01:25:05,247
You said he takes a drive in his carriage
after breakfast every day.

757
01:25:05,824 --> 01:25:06,865
Yes, sir.

758
01:25:08,076 --> 01:25:11,856
Is there any reason to believe
that he'll do any different tomorrow?

759
01:25:12,622 --> 01:25:13,664
No, sir.

760
01:25:14,332 --> 01:25:15,374
Good.

761
01:25:17,043 --> 01:25:20,170
When the Chevalier comes out
to his carriage in the morning...

762
01:25:20,422 --> 01:25:23,757
two officers will meet him
and escort him to the frontier.

763
01:25:24,676 --> 01:25:26,844
His baggage will be sent after him.

764
01:25:27,178 --> 01:25:28,303
Excellent.

765
01:25:40,567 --> 01:25:43,200
<i>At ten o'clock the next morning...</i>

766
01:25:43,528 --> 01:25:45,654
<i>the Chevalier de Balibari...</i>

767
01:25:46,239 --> 01:25:49,720
<i>went out for his regular morning drive.</i>

768
01:25:58,543 --> 01:26:00,335
Where is my servant, Lazlo?

769
01:26:00,795 --> 01:26:03,255
I will let down the steps for Your Honour.

770
01:26:14,184 --> 01:26:15,309
What is the meaning of this?

771
01:26:15,477 --> 01:26:16,894
Please get inside.

772
01:26:19,564 --> 01:26:21,065
Am I under arrest?

773
01:26:21,608 --> 01:26:23,567
We're going to drive to the frontier.

774
01:26:24,652 --> 01:26:28,322
To the frontier? But I'm on my way
to the Austrian Ambassador's house.

775
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:31,926
I'm sorry Your Honour, but my
orders are to escort you to the frontier...

776
01:26:31,951 --> 01:26:34,244
and see you safely across the border.

777
01:26:34,704 --> 01:26:36,497
But, I'm not going to the frontier.

778
01:26:36,671 --> 01:26:40,716
I'm going to the Austrian Ambassador's house.
I have very important business there.

779
01:26:41,252 --> 01:26:45,547
My orders are to take Your Honour to the
frontier by any means which may be necessary.

780
01:26:46,174 --> 01:26:47,669
But if you come along willingly...

781
01:26:47,694 --> 01:26:50,634
I'm to give you this purse
on behalf of the Prince of Tübingen...

782
01:26:50,694 --> 01:26:52,846
containing 2,000 Frederick d'or.

783
01:27:02,941 --> 01:27:04,900
All Europe shall hear of this.

784
01:27:11,241 --> 01:27:14,868
<i>And so, without papers or passport...</i>

785
01:27:15,995 --> 01:27:18,789
<i>and under the eyes
of two Prussian officers...</i>

786
01:27:19,124 --> 01:27:23,752
<i>Barry was escorted across the frontier
into Saxony and freedom.</i>

787
01:27:25,463 --> 01:27:30,050
<i>The Chevalier himself had uneventfully
crossed the frontier the night before.</i>

788
01:27:42,564 --> 01:27:47,025
<i>And by these wonderful circumstances,
Barry was once more free again...</i>

789
01:27:48,194 --> 01:27:50,821
<i>and began his professional work
as a gamester...</i>

790
01:27:51,698 --> 01:27:56,785
<i>resolving, thenceforward and forever,
to live the life of a gentleman.</i>

791
01:27:58,997 --> 01:28:00,289
The four wins.

792
01:28:01,583 --> 01:28:06,303
<i>Soon there was no court in Europe where
he and the Chevalier were not received...</i>

793
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:12,277
<i>and they were speedily in the very
best society where play was patronized...</i>

794
01:28:12,302 --> 01:28:15,554
<i>and professors of that science
always welcome.</i>

795
01:28:18,933 --> 01:28:20,058
The seven.

796
01:28:20,810 --> 01:28:22,227
Why not the seven?

797
01:28:24,063 --> 01:28:25,397
All... all, yes.

798
01:28:30,445 --> 01:28:31,904
No more bets.

799
01:28:37,994 --> 01:28:39,036
Number seven...

800
01:28:39,204 --> 01:28:40,454
loses.

801
01:28:49,047 --> 01:28:50,505
Place your bets.

802
01:28:53,593 --> 01:28:57,471
Chevalier, will you give me
credit for 5,000 Louis d'or, please?

803
01:28:58,348 --> 01:29:00,098
Of course, Lord Ludd.

804
01:29:12,153 --> 01:29:13,403
Five thousand.

805
01:29:15,657 --> 01:29:17,616
Now, everything on the four.

806
01:29:21,287 --> 01:29:24,039
Yes, I know, everything on the four.

807
01:29:35,969 --> 01:29:37,261
No more bets.

808
01:29:44,143 --> 01:29:45,727
The four loses.

809
01:29:55,996 --> 01:29:57,383
Another game?

810
01:29:59,325 --> 01:30:00,993
It is not important.

811
01:30:02,662 --> 01:30:05,122
Now, I'm weary.

812
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:08,959
I would like dinner. Shall we?

813
01:30:11,629 --> 01:30:13,463
Excuse me, Lord Ludd.

814
01:30:14,924 --> 01:30:16,300
If you don't mind.

815
01:30:17,552 --> 01:30:18,635
Not at all.

816
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:26,506
<i>They always played on credit
with any person of honour or noble lineage.</i>

817
01:30:27,228 --> 01:30:29,313
<i>They never pressed for their winnings...</i>

818
01:30:29,564 --> 01:30:32,482
<i>or declined to receive
promissory notes in lieu of gold.</i>

819
01:30:34,068 --> 01:30:37,362
<i>But woe to the man who did not pay
when the note became due.</i>

820
01:30:38,156 --> 01:30:41,241
<i>Redmond Barry was sure to wait upon him
with his bill.</i>

821
01:30:41,951 --> 01:30:43,618
<i>And there were few bad debts.</i>

822
01:30:43,786 --> 01:30:44,828
Saluez.

823
01:30:45,496 --> 01:30:49,600
<i>It was his great skill
with the sword, and readiness to use it...</i>

824
01:30:49,625 --> 01:30:52,753
<i>that maintained the reputation
of the firm, so to speak.</i>

825
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:53,920
En garde!

826
01:31:44,430 --> 01:31:46,348
I will pay you today, sir.

827
01:31:48,017 --> 01:31:50,143
<i>Thus, it will be seen, that their life...</i>

828
01:31:50,812 --> 01:31:54,398
<i>for all its splendour,
was not without danger and difficulty...</i>

829
01:31:55,650 --> 01:31:58,443
<i>requiring talent and determination
for success.</i>

830
01:31:59,570 --> 01:32:03,031
<i>And one which required them to live
a wandering and disconnected life.</i>

831
01:32:04,867 --> 01:32:09,079
<i>And if the truth be told, though they were
swimming upon the high tide of fortune...</i>

832
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:13,792
<i>and prospering with the cards,
they had little to show for their labour...</i>

833
01:32:14,043 --> 01:32:16,670
<i>but some fine clothes
and a few trinkets.</i>

834
01:32:29,559 --> 01:32:34,604
<i>Five years in the Army, and some
considerable experience of the world...</i>

835
01:32:35,231 --> 01:32:39,609
<i>had by now dispelled any romantic notions
regarding love...</i>

836
01:32:40,194 --> 01:32:42,362
<i>with which Barry commenced life.</i>

837
01:32:43,030 --> 01:32:47,159
<i>And he began to have it in mind,
as so many gentlemen had done before him...</i>

838
01:32:47,785 --> 01:32:50,954
<i>to marry a woman
of fortune and condition.</i>

839
01:32:52,123 --> 01:32:54,541
<i>And, as such things so often happen...</i>

840
01:32:54,917 --> 01:32:59,522
<i>these thoughts closely coincided
with his setting first sight upon a lady...</i>

841
01:32:59,553 --> 01:33:04,110
<i>who will henceforth play a
considerable part in the drama of his life.</i>

842
01:33:05,052 --> 01:33:07,012
<i>The Countess of Lyndon...</i>

843
01:33:07,889 --> 01:33:10,182
<i>Viscountess Bullingdon of England...</i>

844
01:33:10,349 --> 01:33:12,767
<i>Baroness Castle Lyndon of Ireland.</i>

845
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:17,063
<i>A woman of vast wealth and great beauty.</i>

846
01:33:19,650 --> 01:33:23,236
<i>She was the wife of the right
honourable Sir Charles Reginald Lyndon...</i>

847
01:33:23,571 --> 01:33:25,113
<i>Knight of the Bath...</i>

848
01:33:25,281 --> 01:33:29,075
<i>Minister to George III
at several of the Courts of Europe.</i>

849
01:33:30,077 --> 01:33:32,537
<i>A cripple, wheeled about in a chair...</i>

850
01:33:33,289 --> 01:33:36,541
<i>worn out by gout
and a myriad of diseases.</i>

851
01:33:38,336 --> 01:33:40,795
<i>Her Ladyship's Chaplain, Mr. Runt...</i>

852
01:33:41,255 --> 01:33:46,168
<i>acted in the capacity of tutor to her son,
the little Viscount Bullingdon...</i>

853
01:33:46,219 --> 01:33:49,763
<i>a melancholy little boy,
much attached to his mother.</i>

854
01:36:08,861 --> 01:36:11,237
Samuel, I'm going
outside for a breath of air.

855
01:36:11,864 --> 01:36:13,156
Yes, My Lady.

856
01:38:09,315 --> 01:38:11,608
<i>To make a long story short...</i>

857
01:38:12,359 --> 01:38:16,488
<i>six hours after they met...
Her Ladyship was in love.</i>

858
01:38:17,531 --> 01:38:19,866
<i>And once Barry got into her company...</i>

859
01:38:20,367 --> 01:38:23,953
<i>he found innumerable occasions
to improve his intimacy...</i>

860
01:38:25,206 --> 01:38:28,208
<i>and was scarcely out
of Her Ladyship's sight.</i>

861
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:23,263
Good evening, gentlemen.

862
01:39:23,430 --> 01:39:24,889
Good evening.

863
01:39:26,225 --> 01:39:27,392
Sir Charles.

864
01:39:30,104 --> 01:39:31,896
Good evening, Mr. Barry.

865
01:39:32,857 --> 01:39:34,816
Have you done with my Lady?

866
01:39:37,528 --> 01:39:38,570
I beg your pardon?

867
01:39:39,363 --> 01:39:44,242
Come, sir. I'm a man who would rather
be known as a cuckold than a fool.

868
01:39:47,079 --> 01:39:50,498
I think, Sir Charles Lyndon,
that you've had too much to drink.

869
01:39:50,666 --> 01:39:52,500
Ha, ha, what?

870
01:39:52,793 --> 01:39:58,505
As it happens, your Chaplain, Mr. Runt,
introduced me into the company of your Lady...

871
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:02,985
to advise me on a religious matter,
of which she is a considerable expert.

872
01:40:09,059 --> 01:40:13,021
He wants... to step into my shoes.

873
01:40:14,398 --> 01:40:17,150
He wants to step into my shoes.

874
01:40:19,528 --> 01:40:23,156
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me,
as I am drawing near the goal...

875
01:40:23,407 --> 01:40:25,992
to find my home such a happy one...

876
01:40:26,493 --> 01:40:30,663
my wife so fond of me, that she is even
now thinking of appointing a successor?

877
01:40:30,831 --> 01:40:33,416
Isn't it a comfort to see her
like a prudent housewife...

878
01:40:33,584 --> 01:40:36,836
getting everything ready
for her husband's departure?

879
01:40:38,797 --> 01:40:41,925
I hope you're not thinking of
leaving us soon, Sir Charles?

880
01:40:44,219 --> 01:40:47,597
Not so soon, my dear, as
you may fancy, perhaps.

881
01:40:47,765 --> 01:40:51,798
Why, man, I've been given
over many times these four years.

882
01:40:51,852 --> 01:40:54,604
And there was always
a candidate or two...

883
01:40:54,772 --> 01:40:58,020
waiting to apply for the situation.

884
01:40:58,067 --> 01:40:59,567
I'm sorry for you, Mr. Barry.

885
01:40:59,735 --> 01:41:02,487
It grieves me to keep you
or any gentleman waiting.

886
01:41:02,655 --> 01:41:04,822
Had you not better arrange
with my doctor...

887
01:41:05,032 --> 01:41:08,576
or have the cook flavour my omelet
with arsenic, eh?

888
01:41:09,244 --> 01:41:14,374
What are the odds, gentlemen,
that I live to see Mr. Barry hang yet?

889
01:41:18,379 --> 01:41:22,119
Sir, let those laugh that win.

890
01:41:24,718 --> 01:41:25,843
Gentlemen.

891
01:41:47,749 --> 01:41:49,075
I'll get a surgeon.

892
01:41:53,998 --> 01:41:55,957
Have some brandy, Sir Charles.

Redmond?

936
01:46:34,027 --> 01:46:37,530
My Lord Bullingdon,
you seem particularly glum today.

937
01:46:42,160 --> 01:46:45,413
You should be happy
that your mother has remarried.

938
01:46:49,710 --> 01:46:51,043
Not in this way.

939
01:46:53,922 --> 01:46:55,548
And not in such haste.

940
01:46:57,718 --> 01:46:59,844
And certainly not to this man.

941
01:47:03,265 --> 01:47:05,766
I think you judge your mother too harshly.

942
01:47:07,561 --> 01:47:10,396
Do you not like your new father?

943
01:47:12,357 --> 01:47:13,649
Not very much.

944
01:47:15,110 --> 01:47:18,195
He seems to me little more
than a common opportunist.

945
01:47:19,364 --> 01:47:21,824
I don't think he loves my mother at all.

946
01:47:22,909 --> 01:47:26,746
And it hurts me to see her
make such a fool of herself.

947
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:51,562
<i>At the end of a year
Her Ladyship presented Barry with a son.</i>

<i>She preferred quiet, or to say the truth,
he preferred it for her...</i>

<i>For whose sake it was fit,
Barry believed...</i>

959
01:48:49,663 --> 01:48:53,541
<i>that she should give up the pleasures

<i>leaving that part of the duty

<i>to be performed by him.</i>

962
01:50:17,459 --> 01:50:21,712
<i>Lady Lyndon tended
to a melancholy and maudlin temper...</i>

963
01:50:22,756 --> 01:50:26,926
<i>and, left alone by her husband,
was rarely happy or in good humour.</i>

964
01:50:28,094 --> 01:50:31,680
<i>Now she must add jealousy
to her other complaints...</i>

965
01:50:32,349 --> 01:50:35,434
<i>and find rivals even among her maids.</i>

966
01:51:05,382 --> 01:51:07,675
Samuel, what would the time be?

967
01:51:10,971 --> 01:51:13,472
Twenty-five minutes past eleven,
My Lady.

968
01:51:27,487 --> 01:51:29,780
Shall we make this the last game, ladies?

969
01:51:29,948 --> 01:51:30,990
Yes.

970
01:52:18,913 --> 01:52:20,497
Good morning, ladies.

971
01:52:21,041 --> 01:52:22,374
Good morning, sir.

972
01:52:24,210 --> 01:52:27,880
Would you mind excusing us?
I'd like a word alone with Lady Lyndon.

973
01:52:53,823 --> 01:52:54,907
I'm sorry.

974
01:53:38,660 --> 01:53:41,453
This coat is made of the
finest Littlefield velvet...

975
01:53:42,038 --> 01:53:44,957
all cunningly worked, as you see,
with silver thread.

976
01:53:45,291 --> 01:53:49,795
No finer velvet has ever been woven,
and you will see none better anywhere.

977
01:53:50,463 --> 01:53:52,005
Pardon me, gentlemen.

978
01:53:55,510 --> 01:53:57,302
- Good morning, dearest.
- Good morning.

979
01:53:58,638 --> 01:54:02,516
We're taking the children for a ride
to the village. We'll be back for tea.

980
01:54:02,684 --> 01:54:04,977
Well, have a nice time. I'll see you then.

981
01:54:05,186 --> 01:54:06,979
Goodbye, little Bryan.

982
01:54:11,484 --> 01:54:12,901
Lord Bullingdon.

983
01:54:15,280 --> 01:54:17,197
Take good care of your mother.

984
01:54:22,912 --> 01:54:25,845
Come now, give your father a proper kiss.

985
01:54:36,301 --> 01:54:37,676
Lord Bullingdon...

986
01:54:38,511 --> 01:54:41,305
is that the way to behave
to your father?

987
01:54:45,226 --> 01:54:47,728
Lord Bullingdon,
have you lost your tongue?

988
01:54:50,315 --> 01:54:55,819
My father was Sir Charles Lyndon.
I have not forgotten him, if others have.

989
01:54:57,030 --> 01:54:59,643
Lord Bullingdon,
you have insulted your father!

990
01:55:01,451 --> 01:55:03,911
Madam, you have insulted my father.

991
01:55:08,792 --> 01:55:11,485
Dearest, would you excuse Lord
Bullington and me for a few minutes?

992
01:55:11,510 --> 01:55:13,396
We have something
to discuss in private.

993
01:55:13,421 --> 01:55:14,713
Gentlemen.

994
01:55:27,227 --> 01:55:28,268
One.

995
01:55:31,606 --> 01:55:32,648
Two.

996
01:55:36,319 --> 01:55:37,402
Three.

997
01:55:40,782 --> 01:55:42,032
Four.

998
01:55:45,078 --> 01:55:46,203
Five.

999
01:55:49,082 --> 01:55:50,165
Six.

1000
01:55:59,342 --> 01:56:00,801
Lord Bullingdon...

1001
01:56:02,095 --> 01:56:05,597
I have always been willing
to live with you on terms of friendship.

1002
01:56:06,015 --> 01:56:07,933
But be clear about one thing:

1003
01:56:09,269 --> 01:56:11,812
As men serve me, I serve them.

1004
01:56:13,106 --> 01:56:15,649
I never laid a cane on the back
of a Lord before...

1005
01:56:15,817 --> 01:56:19,778
but, if you force me to, I shall
speedily become used to the practice.

1006
01:56:22,365 --> 01:56:24,783
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

1007
01:56:27,120 --> 01:56:28,120
No.

1008
01:56:31,749 --> 01:56:32,916
You may go.

1009
01:56:33,877 --> 01:56:38,255
<i>Barry believed, and not
without some reason, that it had been...</i>

1010
01:56:38,506 --> 01:56:42,634
<i>a declaration of war against him
by Bullingdon from the start...</i>

1011
01:56:43,261 --> 01:56:45,888
<i>and that the evil consequences
which ensued...</i>

1012
01:56:46,055 --> 01:56:48,515
<i>were entirely of Bullingdon's creating.</i>

1013
01:56:51,644 --> 01:56:54,313
I shall make you into
a real magician now, Bryan.

1014
01:56:54,480 --> 01:56:57,691
I shall show you the knot that never was.

1015
01:56:58,443 --> 01:57:01,194
<i>As Bullingdon grew up to be a man...</i>

1016
01:57:02,155 --> 01:57:05,198
<i>his hatred for Barry
assumed an intensity...</i>

1017
01:57:05,909 --> 01:57:09,202
<i>equalled only by his
increased devotion to his mother.</i>

1018
01:57:09,454 --> 01:57:11,538
Very good, Bryan. A little bow.

1019
01:57:14,751 --> 01:57:17,002
Put it on the table for me.
Thank you.

1020
01:57:17,295 --> 01:57:23,634
<i>For Bryan's eighth birthday the
local nobility, gentry and their children...</i>

1021
01:57:23,968 --> 01:57:25,677
came to pay their respects.

1022
01:57:25,845 --> 01:57:29,365
The inside is quite empty.
The outside is quite empty.

1023
01:57:29,390 --> 01:57:32,225
Wave your hand over the top, Bryan.
Is there anything there?

1024
01:57:32,393 --> 01:57:33,936
Yes? Oh!

1025
01:57:34,520 --> 01:57:37,689
Wonderful! Wonderful, colourful
silk handkerchiefs!

1026
01:57:37,857 --> 01:57:40,525
Take a bow, Bryan,
you did that beautifully.

1027
01:57:40,777 --> 01:57:41,860
Very good indeed.

1028
01:57:42,362 --> 01:57:44,863
Let's see if you have something
behind your ear.

1029
01:57:45,031 --> 01:57:46,198
Yes, you have. Ha, ha.

1030
01:57:46,699 --> 01:57:48,450
A little ball. Let's make it vanish.

1031
01:57:48,558 --> 01:57:49,464
It's gone, Bryan.

1032
01:57:49,489 --> 01:57:52,608
Here it is! Here it is, behind my elbow.

1033
01:57:54,624 --> 01:57:57,376
I want you you to wave your hand
over my green silk handkerchief...

1034
01:57:57,543 --> 01:58:01,421
and see whether we can produce
a magic flower. I wonder if we can?

1035
01:58:02,169 --> 01:58:03,590
Here it comes. Look at that.

1036
01:58:04,936 --> 01:58:06,843
We have the colours of the rainbow.

1037
01:58:07,220 --> 01:58:11,556
You know all the colours of the rainbow
produce but one colour, Bryan.

1038
01:58:12,058 --> 01:58:13,809
Nothing in my magic cabinet.

1039
01:58:13,977 --> 01:58:15,978
They produce the colour... white.

1040
01:58:16,145 --> 01:58:18,063
And there is my own...

1041
01:58:18,606 --> 01:58:21,233
beautiful white rabbit.

1042
01:58:23,277 --> 01:58:26,238
Bryan, you did that very well.
A little bow.

1043
01:58:50,430 --> 01:58:54,057
We crept up on their fort,
and I jumped over the wall first.

1044
01:58:54,267 --> 01:58:56,059
My fellows jumped after me.

1045
01:58:56,602 --> 01:59:01,064
You should have seen the look on the Frenchmen's
faces when 23 rampaging he-devils...

1046
01:59:01,774 --> 01:59:06,403
sword and pistol, cut and thrust,
pell-mell, came tumbling into their fort.

1047
01:59:07,864 --> 01:59:10,991
In three minutes we left
as many Artillerymen's heads...

1048
01:59:11,159 --> 01:59:12,951
as there were cannonballs.

1049
01:59:14,579 --> 01:59:17,664
Later that day we were visited
by our noble Prince Henry.

1050
01:59:18,624 --> 01:59:22,085
"Who is the man who has done this?"
I stepped forward.

1051
01:59:23,116 --> 01:59:25,797
"How many heads was it", says he,
"that you cut off?"

1052
01:59:25,849 --> 01:59:28,717
"Nineteen," says I,
"besides wounding several."

1053
01:59:29,927 --> 01:59:33,889
Well when he heard it, I'll be blessed,
if he didn't burst into tears.

1054
01:59:34,640 --> 01:59:36,600
"Noble, noble fellow," he said.

1055
01:59:36,809 --> 01:59:41,104
"Here is nineteen golden guineas for you,
one for each head that you cut off."

1056
01:59:41,898 --> 01:59:43,482
Now what do you think of that?

1057
01:59:43,649 --> 01:59:45,901
Were you allowed to keep the heads?

1058
01:59:46,819 --> 01:59:49,571
No, the heads always become
the property of the King.

1059
01:59:50,198 --> 01:59:52,157
Will you tell me another story?

1060
01:59:52,658 --> 01:59:54,451
I'll tell you another story tomorrow.

1061
01:59:54,619 --> 01:59:56,912
Will you play cards with me tomorrow?

1062
01:59:57,538 --> 01:59:59,664
Of course I will. Now go to sleep.

1063
02:00:04,045 --> 02:00:06,004
Will you keep the candles lit?

1064
02:00:06,339 --> 02:00:09,549
No Bryan, big boys don't sleep
with the candles lit.

1065
02:00:10,384 --> 02:00:12,177
But I'm afraid of the dark.

1066
02:00:12,428 --> 02:00:15,097
But my darling, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

1067
02:00:16,265 --> 02:00:18,683
But, I like it with the candles lit.

1068
02:00:18,851 --> 02:00:21,770
It's all right, you can sleep
with the candles lit.

1069
02:00:22,939 --> 02:00:24,272
Thank you, Papa.

1070
02:00:24,732 --> 02:00:25,857
Good night.

1071
02:00:48,214 --> 02:00:49,381
Ah, Redmond!

1072
02:00:50,466 --> 02:00:55,887
It's a blessing to see my darling boy
has attained a position I always knew was his due.

1073
02:00:57,974 --> 02:01:00,976
And for which I pinched myself
to educate him.

1074
02:01:03,020 --> 02:01:04,980
Little Bryan is a darling boy...

1075
02:01:06,065 --> 02:01:08,066
and you live in great splendour.

1076
02:01:08,901 --> 02:01:11,027
Your lady wife knows
she has a treasure...

1077
02:01:11,195 --> 02:01:13,947
she couldn't have had,
had she taken a Duke to marry.

1078
02:01:16,617 --> 02:01:19,911
But, if she should tire
of my wild Redmond...

1079
02:01:20,663 --> 02:01:22,998
and his old-fashioned Irish ways...

1080
02:01:24,750 --> 02:01:26,459
or if she should die...

1081
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:30,797
what future would there be
for my son, and my grandson?

1082
02:01:32,717 --> 02:01:34,801
You have not a penny of your own...

1083
02:01:36,429 --> 02:01:39,681
and cannot transact any business
without the countess' signature.

1084
02:01:41,302 --> 02:01:46,021
Upon her death, the entire estate
would go to young Bullingdon...

1085
02:01:47,815 --> 02:01:50,150
who bears you little affection.

1086
02:01:51,736 --> 02:01:53,820
You could be penniless tomorrow...

1087
02:01:54,113 --> 02:01:58,074
and darling Bryan at the mercy
of his stepbrother.

1088
02:02:02,496 --> 02:02:04,331
Shall I tell you something?

1089
02:02:05,708 --> 02:02:10,170
There is only one way for you
and your son to have real security.

1090
02:02:11,255 --> 02:02:13,798
You must obtain a title.

1091
02:02:15,593 --> 02:02:19,346
I shall not rest
until I see you Lord Lyndon.

1092
02:02:22,256 --> 02:02:24,423
You have important friends.

1093
02:02:24,512 --> 02:02:26,847
They can tell you
how these things are done.

1094
02:02:28,053 --> 02:02:31,733
For money, well-timed
and properly applied...

1095
02:02:32,735 --> 02:02:34,694
can accomplish anything.

1096
02:02:37,615 --> 02:02:40,575
<i>And to be sure, Barry was acquainted with someone...</i>

1097
02:02:40,743 --> 02:02:42,661
who knew how these things were done.

1098
02:02:43,704 --> 02:02:47,999
This was the distinguished Barrister
and former Government Minister...

1099
02:02:48,668 --> 02:02:50,001
Lord Hallam...

1100
02:02:50,544 --> 02:02:55,006
whose acquaintance he had made, as he
had so many others, at the gaming table.

1101
02:02:56,342 --> 02:03:00,562
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus,
the Thirteenth Earl of Wendover?

1102
02:03:01,681 --> 02:03:03,181
I don't believe I do.

1103
02:03:03,349 --> 02:03:07,727
Well sir, this nobleman is one
of the Gentlemen of His Majesty's Closet...

1104
02:03:08,562 --> 02:03:13,191
and one with whom our revered Monarch
is on terms of considerable intimacy.

1105
02:03:14,860 --> 02:03:18,571
In my opinion, you would be wise
to fix upon him...

1106
02:03:19,198 --> 02:03:24,424
your chief reliance for the advancement of your
claim to the peerage which you prefer as to get.

1107
02:03:26,539 --> 02:03:30,667
When I take up a person, Mr. Lyndon,
he, or she, is safe.

1108
02:03:31,324 --> 02:03:33,920
There is no question about them any more.

1109
02:03:34,338 --> 02:03:39,391
My friends are the best people.
I don't mean they're the most virtuous...

1110
02:03:39,885 --> 02:03:43,179
or, indeed, the least virtuous,
or the cleverest...

1111
02:03:43,389 --> 02:03:46,224
or the stupidest,
or the richest or the best born.

1112
02:03:46,892 --> 02:03:48,059
But, the best.

1113
02:03:48,227 --> 02:03:51,855
In a word, people about whom
there is no question.

1114
02:03:53,816 --> 02:03:56,401
I cannot promise you how long it will take.

1115
02:03:56,944 --> 02:03:59,904
You can appreciate
it is not an easy matter.

1116
02:04:00,698 --> 02:04:04,701
But, any gentleman with an estate,
and 30,000 a year...

1117
02:04:05,494 --> 02:04:07,203
should have a peerage.

1118
02:04:11,709 --> 02:04:14,919
And there standing behind me
was a total stranger.

1119
02:04:15,379 --> 02:04:17,714
So I looked at him, and he said to me:

1120
02:04:18,132 --> 02:04:23,178
"Excuse me, sir, could you tell me,
is Lord Wendover alive or dead?"

1121
02:04:25,431 --> 02:04:27,849
I was so astonished,
I couldn't think of what to say.

1122
02:04:28,017 --> 02:04:31,311
Then I became a bit angry,
and said to him, "He's dead."

1123
02:04:31,687 --> 02:04:36,733
<i>The striving after this peerage was one of
Barry's most unlucky dealings of this time.</i>

1124
02:04:38,235 --> 02:04:40,904
<i>He made great sacrifices
to bring it about.</i>

1125
02:04:42,156 --> 02:04:44,991
<i>He lavished money here,
and diamonds there.</i>

1126
02:04:46,619 --> 02:04:49,162
<i>He bought lands
at ten times their value...</i>

1127
02:04:49,455 --> 02:04:53,666
<i>purchased pictures and articles
of virtue at ruinous prices.</i>

1128
02:04:55,127 --> 02:04:58,713
<i>He gave repeated entertainments
to those friends to his claim...</i>

1129
02:04:59,423 --> 02:05:03,176
<i>who, being about the royal person,
were likely to advance it.</i>

1130
02:05:04,637 --> 02:05:09,641
<i>And, I can tell you, bribes were
administered. And in high places, too.</i>

1131
02:05:11,143 --> 02:05:15,688
<i>So near the royal person of His Majesty
that you would be astonished to know...</i>

1132
02:05:16,232 --> 02:05:20,068
<i>what great noblemen condescended
to receive his loans.</i>

1133
02:05:23,739 --> 02:05:25,865
This is by Ludovico Cordi...

1134
02:05:26,700 --> 02:05:28,827
a disciple of Alessandro Allori.

1135
02:05:30,162 --> 02:05:32,414
It's dated 1605...

1136
02:05:33,499 --> 02:05:35,834
and shows,
"The Adoration of The Magi".

1137
02:05:38,587 --> 02:05:39,796
It's beautiful.

1138
02:05:39,964 --> 02:05:41,005
Yes.

1139
02:05:42,425 --> 02:05:45,427
I love the use of the colour blue
by the artist.

1140
02:05:45,928 --> 02:05:47,846
Yes indeed, that is very beautiful.

1141
02:05:50,474 --> 02:05:52,392
What, may I ask, is the price of this one?

1142
02:05:54,311 --> 02:05:56,563
Well, this is one of my best pictures.

1143
02:05:57,356 --> 02:06:02,152
But, if you really like it, I'm sure
we can come to some arrangement.

1144
02:06:06,866 --> 02:06:08,116
Count Andrachier.

1145
02:06:08,284 --> 02:06:09,451
Count Andrachier.

1146
02:06:09,618 --> 02:06:11,077
Mr. Henry Drummond.

1147
02:06:11,245 --> 02:06:12,328
Mr. Drummond.

1148
02:06:12,496 --> 02:06:14,080
Sir Gilbert Elliot, Your Majesty.

1149
02:06:14,248 --> 02:06:15,498
Sir Gilbert.

1150
02:06:15,666 --> 02:06:17,167
Lord Wendover, Your Majesty.

1151
02:06:17,334 --> 02:06:19,669
I'm glad to see you here today,
Lord Wendover.

1152
02:06:19,837 --> 02:06:21,713
And tell me, what news of Lady Wendover?

1153
02:06:21,881 --> 02:06:24,883
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Lady Wendover is much better.

1154
02:06:25,050 --> 02:06:29,554
Good, good! Present my compliments to her.
Say we miss her company here.

1155
02:06:29,722 --> 02:06:30,972
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1156
02:06:31,140 --> 02:06:33,099
And what of those excellent boys
of yours?

1157
02:06:33,153 --> 02:06:37,937
They're very well. Charles has gone to sea under
the protection of Captain Geary on the Ramillies.

1158
02:06:38,230 --> 02:06:41,316
And John has gone to Oxford to be taught
how to preach and pray.

1159
02:06:41,484 --> 02:06:42,567
Good, good!

1160
02:06:43,611 --> 02:06:46,791
- Your Majesty, may I present Mr. Barry Lyndon.
- Your Majesty.

1161
02:06:46,864 --> 02:06:50,377
Mr. Lyndon. We were very fond
of Sir Charles Lyndon.

1162
02:06:50,409 --> 02:06:51,951
And how is Lady Lyndon?

1163
02:06:52,119 --> 02:06:54,037
She's very well, Your Majesty.

1164
02:06:54,371 --> 02:06:57,451
Mr. Lyndon raised a company
of troops and sent them to America

1165
02:06:57,475 --> 02:06:59,852
to fight the rebels
against Your Majesty's crown.

1166
02:06:59,877 --> 02:07:03,671
Good, that's right Mr. Lyndon. Raise
another company and go with them, too.

1167
02:07:04,548 --> 02:07:06,090
Sir Christopher Neville, Your Majesty.

1168
02:07:06,258 --> 02:07:07,759
Sir Christopher.

1169
02:07:07,973 --> 02:07:09,352
Peregrine Cavendish.

1170
02:07:09,377 --> 02:07:10,419
Mr. Peregrine.

1171
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:20,480
<i>Barry was one of those born
clever enough at gaining a fortune...</i>

1172
02:07:21,065 --> 02:07:23,107
<i>but incapable of keeping one.</i>

1173
02:07:24,693 --> 02:07:28,821
<i>For the qualities and energies
which lead a man to achieve the first...</i>

1174
02:07:29,198 --> 02:07:32,492
<i>are often the very cause of his ruin
in the latter case.</i>

1175
02:07:34,286 --> 02:07:38,933
<i>Now he was burdened with
the harassing cares and responsibilities...</i>

1176
02:07:38,958 --> 02:07:42,210
<i>which are the dismal adjuncts
of great rank and property.</i>

1177
02:07:43,295 --> 02:07:44,879
<i>And his life at this period...</i>

1178
02:07:45,589 --> 02:07:50,236
<i>seemed to consist of little more than drafts
of letters to lawyers and money-brokers...</i>

1179
02:07:50,261 --> 02:07:53,972
<i>and endless correspondence
with decorators and cooks.</i>

1180
02:08:19,039 --> 02:08:23,334
Gentlemen, I'm going to leave you on your own for
a few minutes. You may carry on with your work.

1181
02:08:23,627 --> 02:08:24,669
Yes, sir.

1182
02:08:42,563 --> 02:08:43,605
Bully.

1183
02:08:44,565 --> 02:08:46,065
Mm-hm?

1184
02:08:47,276 --> 02:08:48,443
What does...

1185
02:08:50,195 --> 02:08:51,946
"strenuous" mean?

1186
02:08:55,909 --> 02:08:57,702
Bryan, I'm trying to work.

1187
02:09:00,581 --> 02:09:02,165
But what does it mean?

1188
02:09:06,170 --> 02:09:08,796
It means "an effort requiring strength".

1189
02:09:15,512 --> 02:09:17,472
What does "quadrangle" mean?

1190
02:09:23,896 --> 02:09:27,690
A quadrangle is a four-sided figure
like a square or a rectangle.

1191
02:09:28,692 --> 02:09:31,653
Now, please be quiet, Bryan,
and let me get on with my work.

1192
02:09:46,835 --> 02:09:48,711
Bryan, please be quiet!

1193
02:09:52,925 --> 02:09:54,550
Have you seen my pencil?

1194
02:09:57,930 --> 02:09:59,222
No, Bryan, I haven't.

1195
02:10:14,071 --> 02:10:16,698
Bryan, please stop making so much noise.

1196
02:10:21,286 --> 02:10:22,495
That's my pencil. Give it...

1197
02:10:22,663 --> 02:10:23,705
No, it isn't.

1198
02:10:23,872 --> 02:10:25,415
It is. It's my pencil!

1199
02:10:25,582 --> 02:10:26,916
I've had this all morning.

1200
02:10:27,084 --> 02:10:28,292
It's my pencil!

1201
02:10:28,585 --> 02:10:30,294
Listen, will you be quiet!

1202
02:10:30,462 --> 02:10:31,713
It's my pencil!

1203
02:10:33,382 --> 02:10:34,549
I'll teach you a lesson.

1204
02:10:37,720 --> 02:10:39,595
What the devil's going on in here?

1205
02:10:41,140 --> 02:10:44,183
I told you never
to lay a hand on this child.

1206
02:10:46,770 --> 02:10:47,812
One.

1207
02:10:51,233 --> 02:10:52,275
Two.

1208
02:10:55,362 --> 02:10:56,654
Three.

1209
02:10:58,991 --> 02:11:00,116
Four.

1210
02:11:02,661 --> 02:11:03,953
Five.

1211
02:11:06,540 --> 02:11:07,915
Six.

1212
02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:17,133
Will that be all, Mr. Redmond Barry?

1213
02:11:18,761 --> 02:11:20,428
Yes, that will be all.

1214
02:11:24,266 --> 02:11:25,933
Well then, look you now.

1215
02:11:27,728 --> 02:11:32,398
From this moment, I will submit
to no further chastisement from you.

1216
02:11:34,568 --> 02:11:37,862
I will kill you if you lay hands
on me ever again.

1217
02:11:40,532 --> 02:11:42,450
Is that entirely clear to you, sir?

1218
02:11:46,288 --> 02:11:47,622
Get out of here!

1219
02:13:48,493 --> 02:13:51,787
Don't you think he fits my shoes
very well, Your Ladyship?

1220
02:13:57,836 --> 02:13:59,170
Dear child...

1221
02:14:00,422 --> 02:14:03,424
what a pity it is I'm not dead,
for your sake.

1222
02:14:05,969 --> 02:14:08,679
The Lyndons would then have
a worthy representative...

1223
02:14:09,473 --> 02:14:11,182
and enjoy all the benefits...

1224
02:14:11,350 --> 02:14:14,477
of the illustrious blood
of the Barrys of Barryville.

1225
02:14:19,191 --> 02:14:20,483
Would they not...

1226
02:14:21,693 --> 02:14:23,194
Mr. Redmond Barry?

1227
02:14:29,493 --> 02:14:31,702
From the way I love this child, My Lord...

1228
02:14:32,079 --> 02:14:34,956
you ought to know how
I would've loved his elder brother...

1229
02:14:35,123 --> 02:14:37,833
had he proved worthy
of any mother's affection.

1230
02:14:39,503 --> 02:14:40,544
Madam!

1231
02:14:43,715 --> 02:14:46,425
I have borne as long
as mortal could endure...

1232
02:14:46,593 --> 02:14:51,222
the ill treatment of the insolent Irish
upstart whom you've taken to your bed.

1233
02:14:52,356 --> 02:14:57,812
It is not only the lowness of his birth and the
general brutality of his manners which disgust me.

1234
02:14:58,647 --> 02:15:02,024
But the shameful nature of his conduct
toward Your Ladyship...

1235
02:15:02,192 --> 02:15:05,111
his brutal and ungentlemanlike
behaviour...

1236
02:15:05,362 --> 02:15:06,862
his open infidelity...

1237
02:15:07,322 --> 02:15:11,450
his shameless robberies and swindling
of my property, and yours.

1238
02:15:12,536 --> 02:15:17,540
And as I cannot personally chastise
this low-bred ruffian, and as I cannot bear...

1239
02:15:17,708 --> 02:15:19,346
to witness his treatment of you...

1240
02:15:19,371 --> 02:15:22,503
and loathe this horrible society
as if it were the plague...

1241
02:15:23,839 --> 02:15:26,799
I have decided to leave my home
and never return.

1242
02:15:27,551 --> 02:15:29,885
At least, during his detested life...

1243
02:15:30,804 --> 02:15:31,846
or during my own.

1244
02:17:03,814 --> 02:17:04,855
Good day, My Lord.

1245
02:17:05,023 --> 02:17:06,440
Good day, Barker.

1246
02:17:08,944 --> 02:17:10,653
Will anyone be joining
Your Lordship?

1247
02:17:10,821 --> 02:17:12,279
No, I shall be alone.

1248
02:17:18,078 --> 02:17:19,370
Thank you.

1249
02:17:23,875 --> 02:17:25,543
The roast beef's very good, My Lord.

1250
02:17:46,398 --> 02:17:48,482
Hello, Neville. How are you?

1251
02:17:48,942 --> 02:17:50,568
Ah, Barry. Hello.

1252
02:17:51,027 --> 02:17:53,612
I see you're alone.
Why don't you come over join me?

1253
02:17:53,780 --> 02:17:56,907
Oh, thank you, Barry,
you're very kind, but...

1254
02:17:57,534 --> 02:17:59,785
I'm expecting someone to join me soon.

1255
02:18:00,579 --> 02:18:04,498
What a shame! Lady Lyndon and I
have missed your company lately.

1256
02:18:04,916 --> 02:18:07,251
Please give my respects to Lady Lyndon...

1257
02:18:07,419 --> 02:18:10,880
and say I've been very busy of late
and not been able to go about much.

1258
02:18:11,047 --> 02:18:12,089
I shall.

1259
02:18:12,465 --> 02:18:16,093
By the way on the eighth of next month we're
having some guests over for cards...

1260
02:18:16,261 --> 02:18:19,138
we'd love to have you
and Lady Wendover join us.

1261
02:18:20,015 --> 02:18:24,310
I'll check my diary, but I think
I'm engaged on that evening.

1262
02:18:24,853 --> 02:18:27,980
Well, I hope you're not engaged.
We'd love to see you again.

1263
02:18:28,440 --> 02:18:30,858
I'll write and say if I'm free or not.

1264
02:18:31,693 --> 02:18:35,154
I look forward to hearing from you.
It's nice to see you again.

1265
02:18:39,367 --> 02:18:41,660
If he had murdered Lord Bullingdon...

1266
02:18:42,037 --> 02:18:46,498
<i>Barry could scarcely have been received
with more coldness and resentment...</i>

1267
02:18:46,750 --> 02:18:49,376
<i>that now followed him
in town and country.</i>

1268
02:18:50,837 --> 02:18:52,546
<i>His friends fell away from him.</i>

1269
02:18:53,215 --> 02:18:56,175
<i>A legend arose of his cruelty
to his stepson.</i>

1270
02:19:06,978 --> 02:19:09,855
<i>Now all the bills came down
on him together.</i>

1271
02:19:11,191 --> 02:19:14,818
<i>All the bills he had been contracting
for the years of his marriage...</i>

1272
02:19:14,986 --> 02:19:18,072
<i>and which the creditors sent in
with a hasty unanimity.</i>

1273
02:19:18,657 --> 02:19:20,491
<i>Their amount was frightful.</i>

1274
02:19:22,077 --> 02:19:26,205
<i>Barry was now bound up in an
inextricable toil of bills and debts...</i>

1275
02:19:27,249 --> 02:19:31,502
<i>of mortgages and insurances,
and all the evils attendant upon them.</i>

1276
02:19:33,505 --> 02:19:37,258
<i>And Lady Lyndon's income was hampered
almost irretrievably...</i>

1277
02:19:37,717 --> 02:19:39,510
<i>to satisfy these claims.</i>

1278
02:20:27,100 --> 02:20:28,475
Do you think that's good?

1279
02:20:28,643 --> 02:20:29,852
Excellent.

1280
02:20:30,437 --> 02:20:31,729
Who's this?

1281
02:20:32,105 --> 02:20:33,897
It's a peacock on the wall.

1282
02:20:35,900 --> 02:20:37,192
What's it say?

1283
02:20:37,569 --> 02:20:39,570
I saw this bird yesterday.

1284
02:20:44,826 --> 02:20:45,993
Who's that?

1285
02:20:46,661 --> 02:20:48,370
Mama in her coach.

1286
02:20:49,456 --> 02:20:51,081
Is she going to London?

1287
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:53,167
I don't know.

1288
02:20:55,420 --> 02:20:56,503
Parry.

1289
02:20:56,671 --> 02:20:57,880
Parry.

1290
02:20:58,798 --> 02:20:59,840
Very good.

1291
02:21:00,008 --> 02:21:01,508
<i>Barry had his faults...</i>

1292
02:21:02,635 --> 02:21:06,722
<i>but no man could say of him
that he was not a good and tender father.</i>

1293
02:21:08,391 --> 02:21:11,018
<i>He loved his son with a blind partiality.</i>

1294
02:21:12,228 --> 02:21:13,771
<i>He denied him nothing.</i>

1295
02:21:15,440 --> 02:21:19,109
<i>It is impossible to convey
what high hopes he had for the boy...</i>

1296
02:21:19,986 --> 02:21:23,280
<i>and how he indulged
in a thousand fond anticipations...</i>

1297
02:21:23,823 --> 02:21:26,784
<i>as to his future success
and figure in the world.</i>

1298
02:21:29,329 --> 02:21:33,624
<i>But fate had determined that he should
leave none of his race behind him...</i>

1299
02:21:34,751 --> 02:21:36,835
<i>that he should finish his life...</i>

1300
02:21:37,170 --> 02:21:39,171
<i>poor, lonely...</i>

1301
02:21:39,798 --> 02:21:41,131
<i>and childless.</i>

1302
02:21:50,100 --> 02:21:51,141
Papa.

1303
02:21:51,476 --> 02:21:52,559
Yes, Bryan?

1304
02:21:52,727 --> 02:21:54,520
Will you buy me a horse?

1305
02:21:54,687 --> 02:21:56,188
Will I buy you a horse?

1306
02:21:56,523 --> 02:21:57,648
Yes, Papa.

1307
02:21:58,191 --> 02:21:59,942
But you already have little Julia.

1308
02:22:00,110 --> 02:22:02,986
But July's only a pony,
I want a real horse.

1309
02:22:03,196 --> 02:22:05,364
Then I can ride with you on the hunt.

1310
02:22:05,824 --> 02:22:07,699
You think you're big
enough for the hunt, do you?

1311
02:22:07,867 --> 02:22:08,909
Oh, yes, Papa!

1312
02:22:09,077 --> 02:22:13,664
Jonathan Plunkett is only a year older
than I am and he rides with his papa.

1313
02:22:14,874 --> 02:22:16,708
I'll have to think about it.

1314
02:22:17,001 --> 02:22:21,839
Please, say yes, Papa. There's nothing I
want in the whole world more than a horse.

1315
02:22:23,174 --> 02:22:24,508
I'll think about it.

1316
02:22:24,676 --> 02:22:26,677
Oh, thank you, Papa. Thank you!

1317
02:22:31,391 --> 02:22:33,225
How much are you asking for him?

1318
02:22:33,852 --> 02:22:35,310
One hundred guineas.

1319
02:22:36,229 --> 02:22:39,565
He's a nice little horse, but I don't
think he's worth a hundred guineas.

1320
02:22:40,233 --> 02:22:42,860
Seventy-five seems
more like the right price.

1321
02:22:44,696 --> 02:22:47,739
I'll accept eighty guineas,
and not a shilling less.

1322
02:22:49,701 --> 02:22:53,287
Five guineas should never keep two
gentlemen from their drink. Eighty it will be.

1323
02:22:53,455 --> 02:22:54,496
Done, sir.

1324
02:22:55,748 --> 02:23:00,213
Take the horse to Doolan's farm.
Tell him he needs a bit of breaking in.

1325
02:23:00,253 --> 02:23:04,023
And say it's for Master Bryan's birthday
next week, and I want it to be a surprise.

1326
02:23:04,048 --> 02:23:05,483
And remember that yourself.

1327
02:23:05,508 --> 02:23:06,550
Yes, sir.

1328
02:23:51,221 --> 02:23:52,262
Papa.

1329
02:23:54,098 --> 02:23:55,557
What is it, lad?

1330
02:23:55,808 --> 02:23:57,434
Did you buy the horse?

1331
02:23:59,938 --> 02:24:01,647
Horse? What horse is that?

1332
02:24:02,398 --> 02:24:05,359
The horse you were going
to buy me for my birthday.

1333
02:24:07,946 --> 02:24:09,905
I know nothing about any horse.

1334
02:24:10,657 --> 02:24:14,284
But one of the stable boys told Nelly
you'd already bought it...

1335
02:24:14,911 --> 02:24:18,372
and it was at Doolan's farm
where Mick the groom was breaking it in.

1336
02:24:19,082 --> 02:24:20,332
Is that true?

1337
02:24:21,543 --> 02:24:23,126
Bryan, when is your birthday?

1338
02:24:24,796 --> 02:24:25,963
Next Tuesday.

1339
02:24:28,132 --> 02:24:30,842
Well, you'll have to wait till then
to find out.

1340
02:24:31,344 --> 02:24:33,971
Then, it's true! It's true!
Oh, thank you, Papa.

1341
02:24:37,225 --> 02:24:38,433
Bryan?

1342
02:24:39,310 --> 02:24:40,352
Bryan?

1343
02:24:40,520 --> 02:24:41,603
Yes, Mama?

1344
02:24:42,730 --> 02:24:46,441
Promise me you will not ride that horse
except with your father.

1345
02:24:47,860 --> 02:24:49,486
Yes, Mama, I promise.

1346
02:24:51,114 --> 02:24:53,323
And I promise you a lordship of good flogging...

1347
02:24:53,491 --> 02:24:57,077
if you even go to Doolan's farm
to see him before your birthday.

1348
02:24:57,620 --> 02:24:58,662
Yes, Papa.

1349
02:24:58,830 --> 02:24:59,830
You understand?

1350
02:24:59,998 --> 02:25:01,164
Yes, Papa.

1351
02:25:01,624 --> 02:25:02,666
You promise me?

1352
02:25:02,834 --> 02:25:04,334
Yes, Papa, I promise.

1353
02:25:06,504 --> 02:25:08,171
All right, eat your food.

1354
02:25:17,015 --> 02:25:18,265
Come in.

1355
02:25:31,904 --> 02:25:33,196
Good morning, sir.

1356
02:25:33,364 --> 02:25:34,531
Good morning, Reverend.

1357
02:25:34,782 --> 02:25:37,034
I'm sorry to trouble you
with this, Mr. Lyndon...

1358
02:25:37,201 --> 02:25:39,536
but I believe Master Bryan
has disobeyed you...

1359
02:25:39,704 --> 02:25:41,872
and stolen away to Doolan's farm.

1360
02:25:43,082 --> 02:25:46,376
On going to his room this morning,
I found his bed empty.

1361
02:25:46,628 --> 02:25:49,546
One of the cooks said she saw him
cross the yard at daybreak.

1362
02:25:49,714 --> 02:25:51,256
Didn't you see him go?

1363
02:25:51,424 --> 02:25:54,509
He must have passed through my room
while I was asleep.

1364
02:26:26,918 --> 02:26:30,504
Oh, my God! What has happened here?

1365
02:26:30,713 --> 02:26:34,758
I noticed the lad riding
across the field, sir...

1366
02:26:34,926 --> 02:26:38,303
<i>and having trouble with the horse,
which was playing up a bit.</i>

1367
02:26:39,263 --> 02:26:43,433
<i>Suddenly the animal plunged and reared,
and the poor lad was thrown.</i>

1368
02:26:46,646 --> 02:26:48,939
Oh, Bryan, why did you disobey me?

1369
02:26:50,650 --> 02:26:52,192
I'm sorry, Papa.

1370
02:26:52,985 --> 02:26:54,778
You won't whip me, will you?

1371
02:26:57,782 --> 02:26:59,199
No, my darling.

1372
02:27:00,368 --> 02:27:01,702
I won't whip you.

1373
02:27:05,998 --> 02:27:10,210
William, you take my horse and
ride like the devil for Doctor Broughton.

1374
02:27:11,045 --> 02:27:14,297
Tell him whatever he's doing
he must come at once. You understand?

1375
02:27:14,674 --> 02:27:15,882
Yes, sir.

1376
02:27:24,392 --> 02:27:26,059
<i>The doctors were called.</i>

1377
02:27:27,103 --> 02:27:30,939
But what does a doctor avail in a contest
with the grim, invincible enemy?

1378
02:27:32,734 --> 02:27:37,112
Such as came could only confirm
the hopelessness of the poor child's case.

1379
02:27:39,282 --> 02:27:41,908
He remained yet with his parents
for two days.

1380
02:27:43,286 --> 02:27:46,913
And a sad comfort it was to know
he was in no pain.

1381
02:27:48,666 --> 02:27:49,833
Papa.

1382
02:27:57,925 --> 02:27:58,967
Papa.

1383
02:28:00,803 --> 02:28:02,679
Am I going to die?

1384
02:28:08,644 --> 02:28:13,023
No, my darling, you're not going to die.
You're going to get better.

1385
02:28:17,320 --> 02:28:21,740
But I can't feel anything,
except in my hands.

1386
02:28:24,702 --> 02:28:28,497
Does that mean I'm already dead
in part of my body?

1387
02:28:36,255 --> 02:28:39,716
No, my darling, that's where
you were hurt by the horse.

1388
02:28:42,428 --> 02:28:44,638
But you're going to be all right now.

1389
02:28:49,393 --> 02:28:53,063
Papa, if I die, will I go to heaven?

1390
02:28:58,569 --> 02:29:00,612
Of course you will, my darling...

1391
02:29:02,281 --> 02:29:04,282
but you're not going to die.

1392
02:29:09,205 --> 02:29:10,997
Mama, give me your hand.

1393
02:29:21,133 --> 02:29:22,926
Papa, give me your hand.

1394
02:29:29,225 --> 02:29:32,018
Will you both promise me something?

1395
02:29:35,273 --> 02:29:36,314
Yes.

1396
02:29:37,525 --> 02:29:40,777
Promise me never to quarrel so.

1397
02:29:41,362 --> 02:29:43,113
But to love each other.

1398
02:29:43,948 --> 02:29:47,868
So that we may meet again, in heaven...

1399
02:29:48,953 --> 02:29:53,331
where Bullingdon said
quarrelsome people will never go.

1400
02:30:01,716 --> 02:30:02,799
We promise.

1401
02:30:06,429 --> 02:30:09,514
Will you tell me the story
about the fort?

1402
02:30:12,226 --> 02:30:13,310
Of course.

1403
02:30:17,481 --> 02:30:19,149
We crept up on the fort.

1404
02:30:22,987 --> 02:30:28,491
And I jumped over the wall first,
and my fellows jumped after me.

1405
02:30:29,660 --> 02:30:32,162
And you should have seen the look...

1406
02:30:33,789 --> 02:30:39,169
on the Frenchmen's faces when
23 rampaging he-devils, sword and pistol...

1407
02:30:40,212 --> 02:30:43,673
cut and thrust, pell-mell
came tumbling into the fort.

1408
02:30:45,176 --> 02:30:46,593
In three minutes time...

1409
02:30:49,722 --> 02:30:50,931
we left...

1410
02:31:01,317 --> 02:31:05,111
"'I am the resurrection
and the life,' saith the Lord.

1411
02:31:06,530 --> 02:31:10,033
"'He that believeth in me,
though he were dead...

1412
02:31:11,702 --> 02:31:13,328
"'yet shall he live.

1413
02:31:14,330 --> 02:31:17,916
"'And whosoever liveth
and believeth in me...

1414
02:31:19,335 --> 02:31:20,835
"'shall never die.'

1415
02:31:23,631 --> 02:31:26,091
"I know that my Redeemer liveth...

1416
02:31:26,509 --> 02:31:29,970
"and that He shall stand
at the latter day upon the earth.

1417
02:31:31,013 --> 02:31:34,808
"And though after my skin
worms destroy this body...

1418
02:31:35,518 --> 02:31:38,937
"yet in my flesh shall I see God.

1419
02:31:40,731 --> 02:31:44,943
"Whom I shall see for myself
and mine eyes shall behold...

1420
02:31:45,820 --> 02:31:47,320
"and not another.

1421
02:31:49,782 --> 02:31:52,033
"We brought nothing into this world...

1422
02:31:52,618 --> 02:31:55,453
"and it is certain
we can carry nothing out.

1423
02:31:56,747 --> 02:32:01,710
"The Lord gave,
and the Lord hath taken away.

1424
02:32:03,087 --> 02:32:05,422
"Blessed is the name of the Lord."

1425
02:32:50,301 --> 02:32:52,594
<i>Barry's grief was inconsolable.</i>

1426
02:32:54,055 --> 02:32:57,932
<i>And such solace as he could find,
came only from drink.</i>

1427
02:33:00,895 --> 02:33:06,107
<i>His mother was the only person in his
misfortune who would remain faithful to him.</i>

1428
02:33:07,026 --> 02:33:10,653
<i>And many a night, when he was
unconscious of her attention...</i>

1429
02:33:11,072 --> 02:33:13,031
<i>saw him carried off to bed.</i>

1430
02:33:18,662 --> 02:33:20,038
"O blessed Lord...

1431
02:33:20,498 --> 02:33:23,458
"the Father of mercies
and God of all comforts.

1432
02:33:24,043 --> 02:33:27,670
"We beseech Thee, look down
in pity and compassion upon this...

1433
02:33:27,838 --> 02:33:29,547
"Thy afflicted servant.

1434
02:33:30,758 --> 02:33:32,759
"Thou writest bitter things against her...

1435
02:33:32,927 --> 02:33:35,345
"and makest her to possess
her former iniquities."

1436
02:33:35,513 --> 02:33:38,723
<i>Her Ladyship,
always vapourish and nervous...</i>

1437
02:33:39,558 --> 02:33:41,267
plunged into devotion...

1438
02:33:41,435 --> 02:33:46,397
with so much fervour that you would have
imagined her almost distracted at times.

1439
02:34:11,423 --> 02:34:15,385
In the doleful conditions
which now prevailed at Castle Hackton...

1440
02:34:16,178 --> 02:34:19,722
the entire management of the house,
and of the Lyndon estate...

1441
02:34:20,391 --> 02:34:23,560
fell to Mrs. Barry,
whose spirit of order...

1442
02:34:23,811 --> 02:34:28,231
attended to all the 10,000 details
of a great establishment.

1443
02:34:32,403 --> 02:34:33,570
Come in.

1444
02:34:38,159 --> 02:34:39,909
You wish to see me, madam?

1445
02:34:40,411 --> 02:34:42,745
Yes, Reverend. Please sit down.

1446
02:34:47,543 --> 02:34:50,420
I have some matters I would like
to discuss with you later, Graham...

1447
02:34:50,588 --> 02:34:52,755
but just now, perhaps you would go
to Her Ladyship...

1448
02:34:52,923 --> 02:34:54,716
and have these papers signed by her.

1449
02:34:55,718 --> 02:34:56,843
Yes, madam.

1450
02:35:09,648 --> 02:35:11,107
Reverend Runt...

1451
02:35:12,234 --> 02:35:15,653
I need not tell you
that the recent tragedy to this family...

1452
02:35:15,821 --> 02:35:20,116
has made the services of a tutor
no longer required at Castle Hackton.

1453
02:35:21,660 --> 02:35:25,200
And as we are in some
considerable difficulty about money...

1454
02:35:25,539 --> 02:35:29,880
I'm afraid I must ask you,
with the greatest reluctance...

1455
02:35:30,085 --> 02:35:31,711
to resign your post.

1456
02:35:37,718 --> 02:35:41,137
Madam, I'm sensible
of your predicament...

1457
02:35:41,972 --> 02:35:46,851
and you need have no concern about my wages,
with which I can willingly do without...

1458
02:35:47,770 --> 02:35:52,232
but it is out of the question for me to consider
leaving Her Ladyship in her present state.

1459
02:35:55,819 --> 02:35:57,904
I'm very sorry to say this to you...

1460
02:35:58,697 --> 02:36:03,952
but I truly believe you are largely responsible
for the state of mind she is in.

1461
02:36:04,995 --> 02:36:08,206
And the sooner you leave,
the better she will be.

1462
02:36:13,379 --> 02:36:15,672
Madam, with the greatest respect...

1463
02:36:16,257 --> 02:36:19,050
I take my instructions
only from Her Ladyship.

1464
02:36:21,845 --> 02:36:23,221
Reverend Runt...

1465
02:36:24,051 --> 02:36:28,012
Her Ladyship is in no fit mind
to give instructions to anyone.

1466
02:36:29,561 --> 02:36:33,207
My son has charged me with managing
the affairs at Castle Hackton...

1467
02:36:33,232 --> 02:36:37,527
until he recovers from his grief and
resumes his interest in worldly matters.

1468
02:36:38,671 --> 02:36:40,839
And while I am in charge...

1469
02:36:40,864 --> 02:36:43,324
you will take your instructions from me.

1470
02:36:43,951 --> 02:36:46,119
My only concern is for Lady Lyndon.

1471
02:36:49,415 --> 02:36:50,456
Madam...

1472
02:36:52,251 --> 02:36:55,461
your only concern is
for Her Ladyship's signature.

1473
02:36:56,422 --> 02:37:01,384
You and your son have almost succeeded
in destroying a fine family fortune.

1474
02:37:02,261 --> 02:37:04,053
And what little remains for you...

1475
02:37:04,221 --> 02:37:07,390
depends on keeping Her Ladyship
prisoner in her own house.

1476
02:37:07,961 --> 02:37:09,420
Reverend Runt...

1477
02:37:10,269 --> 02:37:13,271
this matter bears
no further discussion.

1478
02:37:13,731 --> 02:37:16,357
You will pack your bags
and leave by tomorrow morning.

1479
02:37:36,211 --> 02:37:39,005
God, help. Help!

1480
02:37:42,343 --> 02:37:44,969
<i>In the midst of these great perplexities...</i>

1481
02:37:45,137 --> 02:37:48,765
<i>Her Ladyship made an attempt
to kill herself by taking poison.</i>

1482
02:37:49,975 --> 02:37:53,435
<i>Though she succeeded only in
making herself dangerously ill...</i>

1483
02:37:53,687 --> 02:37:56,439
<i>due to the very small amount
which she swallowed...</i>

1484
02:37:56,607 --> 02:38:00,735
<i>this, nevertheless, caused
an intervention from a certain quarter...</i>

1485
02:38:01,153 --> 02:38:02,737
<i>which was long overdue.</i>

1486
02:38:02,905 --> 02:38:04,113
Oh, my God!

1487
02:38:36,647 --> 02:38:38,314
If my mother had died...

1488
02:38:39,358 --> 02:38:41,651
it would've been as much
my responsibility...

1489
02:38:41,819 --> 02:38:44,612
as if I had poured
the strychnine for her myself.

1490
02:38:46,323 --> 02:38:49,325
For to the everlasting disgrace
of my family name...

1491
02:38:50,411 --> 02:38:53,663
I have, by my cowardice
and my weakness...

1492
02:38:54,748 --> 02:38:57,500
allowed the Barrys
to establish a brutal...

1493
02:38:57,835 --> 02:39:00,294
and ignorant tyranny over our lives...

1494
02:39:00,796 --> 02:39:03,256
which has left my mother
a broken woman...

1495
02:39:04,341 --> 02:39:09,345
and to squander and ruin
a fine family fortune.

1496
02:39:12,349 --> 02:39:16,686
My friends profess sympathy,
but behind my back...

1497
02:39:17,563 --> 02:39:19,188
I know I am despised.

1498
02:39:20,691 --> 02:39:22,567
And quite justifiably so.

1499
02:39:29,992 --> 02:39:31,075
However...

1500
02:39:34,997 --> 02:39:36,873
I know now what I must do.

1501
02:39:39,877 --> 02:39:41,335
And what I shall do.

1502
02:39:43,797 --> 02:39:45,298
Whatever be the cost.

1503
02:39:59,521 --> 02:40:01,230
Good morning, My Lord.

1504
02:40:01,648 --> 02:40:02,857
Good morning.

1505
02:40:03,859 --> 02:40:05,461
Is Mr. Barry Lyndon here?

1506
02:40:05,486 --> 02:40:07,236
Yes, My Lord, he's inside.

1507
02:40:07,946 --> 02:40:09,155
Thank you.

1508
02:41:46,086 --> 02:41:47,503
Mr. Redmond Barry.

1509
02:41:51,341 --> 02:41:53,593
The last occasion on which we met...

1510
02:41:54,386 --> 02:41:57,263
you wantonly caused me injury
and dishonour.

1511
02:41:58,849 --> 02:42:03,769
In such a manner, and to such an extent as
to which no gentleman can willingly suffer...

1512
02:42:05,480 --> 02:42:07,690
without demanding satisfaction...

1513
02:42:08,775 --> 02:42:10,776
however much time intervenes.

1514
02:42:15,115 --> 02:42:18,492
I have now come to claim
that satisfaction.

1515
02:43:03,413 --> 02:43:04,538
Mr. Lyndon...

1516
02:43:04,693 --> 02:43:07,917
these are a matched pair of pistols,
and as you have seen...

1517
02:43:08,085 --> 02:43:11,420
your second has loaded one,
and I have loaded the other.

1518
02:43:11,797 --> 02:43:16,092
But as they belong to Lord Bullingdon,
you may have whichever one you wish.

1519
02:43:24,055 --> 02:43:25,514
Lord Bullingdon.

1520
02:43:33,449 --> 02:43:37,470
Now, gentlemen, to determine
who will have first fire...

1521
02:43:37,864 --> 02:43:39,782
I will toss a coin in the air.

1522
02:43:39,910 --> 02:43:43,953
And again as the offended party, it is
Lord Bullingdon's choice to call the toss.

1523
02:43:45,122 --> 02:43:47,373
Is that agreeable to both of you?

1524
02:43:49,543 --> 02:43:50,751
Yes.

1525
02:43:53,130 --> 02:43:56,966
If Lord Bullingdon calls correctly
he will have the first fire.

1526
02:43:58,243 --> 02:44:02,243
If incorrectly, Mr. Lyndon
will have the first fire.

1527
02:44:04,015 --> 02:44:05,850
Is that clearly understood?

1528
02:44:13,692 --> 02:44:16,026
What is your call, Lord Bullingdon?

1529
02:44:17,571 --> 02:44:18,612
Heads.

1530
02:44:27,330 --> 02:44:28,497
It is heads.

1531
02:44:30,167 --> 02:44:32,626
Lord Bullingdon will have the first fire.

1532
02:44:37,048 --> 02:44:38,549
Lord Bullingdon...

1533
02:44:39,092 --> 02:44:41,051
will you take your ground?

1534
02:44:54,900 --> 02:44:57,234
One... two... three...

1535
02:44:57,402 --> 02:44:59,236
four... five... six...

1536
02:44:59,529 --> 02:45:02,698
seven... eight... nine... ten.

1537
02:45:08,914 --> 02:45:11,874
Mr. Lyndon, will you take your ground?

1538
02:45:33,104 --> 02:45:37,399
Mr. Lyndon, are you ready to receive
Lord Bullingdon's fire?

1539
02:45:48,954 --> 02:45:50,037
Yes.

1540
02:45:53,834 --> 02:45:55,209
Lord Bullingdon...

1541
02:45:56,586 --> 02:45:58,254
cock your pistol...

1542
02:45:58,880 --> 02:46:00,631
and prepare to fire.

1543
02:46:15,605 --> 02:46:17,982
Sir Richard, this pistol must be faulty.

1544
02:46:18,942 --> 02:46:20,734
I must have another one.

1545
02:46:21,695 --> 02:46:25,072
I'm sorry, Lord Bullingdon,
but you must first stand your ground...

1546
02:46:25,240 --> 02:46:27,658
and allow Mr. Lyndon his turn to fire.

1547
02:46:30,996 --> 02:46:33,122
That is correct, Lord Bullingdon.

1548
02:46:33,957 --> 02:46:38,002
Your pistol has fired,
and that counts as your shot.

1549
02:46:52,392 --> 02:46:56,353
Mr. Lyndon, are the rules of firing
clear to you?

1550
02:46:58,315 --> 02:46:59,356
Yes.

1551
02:47:03,236 --> 02:47:04,653
Lord Bullingdon...

1552
02:47:06,156 --> 02:47:08,782
are you ready to receive
Mr. Lyndon's fire?

1553
02:47:15,665 --> 02:47:16,707
Yes.

1554
02:47:19,961 --> 02:47:21,420
Very well, then.

1555
02:47:24,841 --> 02:47:26,175
Mr. Lyndon...

1556
02:47:27,510 --> 02:47:29,094
cock your pistol...

1557
02:47:30,055 --> 02:47:31,680
and prepare to fire.

1558
02:48:28,738 --> 02:48:31,740
Are you ready, Lord Bullingdon?

1559
02:48:41,251 --> 02:48:43,460
Is your pistol cocked, Mr. Lyndon?

1560
02:48:46,589 --> 02:48:47,631
Yes.

1561
02:48:52,846 --> 02:48:54,346
Then prepare to fire.

1562
02:49:01,021 --> 02:49:02,146
One...

1563
02:49:03,898 --> 02:49:05,024
two...

1564
02:49:17,454 --> 02:49:21,790
Lord Bullingdon, in view of Mr. Lyndon
having fired into the ground...

1565
02:49:22,292 --> 02:49:25,544
do you now consider
that you have received satisfaction?

1566
02:49:39,350 --> 02:49:42,227
I have not received satisfaction.

1567
02:50:14,052 --> 02:50:16,303
Mr. Lyndon, are you ready?

1568
02:50:27,690 --> 02:50:28,732
Yes.

1569
02:50:31,277 --> 02:50:32,653
Lord Bullingdon...

1570
02:50:33,613 --> 02:50:36,073
cock your pistol
and get ready to fire.

1571
02:50:54,676 --> 02:50:55,801
One...

1572
02:50:58,555 --> 02:50:59,721
two...

1573
02:51:19,909 --> 02:51:24,163
<i>Barry was carried to an inn
nearby and a surgeon was called.</i>

1574
02:51:38,303 --> 02:51:39,761
Right, I'm nearly finished.

1575
02:52:01,951 --> 02:52:04,953
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,
Mr. Lyndon.

1576
02:52:06,080 --> 02:52:08,457
I'm afraid you'll have to lose the leg...

1577
02:52:09,292 --> 02:52:11,126
most likely below the knee.

1578
02:52:20,053 --> 02:52:21,345
Lose the leg?

1579
02:52:23,056 --> 02:52:24,223
What for?

1580
02:52:26,309 --> 02:52:28,810
The simple answer to that
is to save your life.

1581
02:52:30,230 --> 02:52:34,358
The ball has shattered the bone
below the knee and severed the artery.

1582
02:52:35,693 --> 02:52:39,015
Unless I can amputate, there's no way
that I can repair the artery...

1583
02:52:39,040 --> 02:52:40,749
and prevent further haemorrhage.

1584
02:53:12,522 --> 02:53:13,563
Graham.

1585
02:53:13,773 --> 02:53:15,023
Yes, My Lord?

1586
02:53:15,400 --> 02:53:20,028
As soon as we arrive at Castle Hackton, I want
you to inform Mrs. Barry of what has happened.

1587
02:53:20,947 --> 02:53:23,198
Don't go into any unnecessary detail.

1588
02:53:23,533 --> 02:53:27,452
Just tell her where he is
and that he has been wounded in the leg.

1589
02:53:28,288 --> 02:53:30,080
She will naturally want to go to him.

1590
02:53:30,700 --> 02:53:35,276
See that she is out of the house and on
her way to London as quickly as possible.

1591
02:53:35,301 --> 02:53:36,371
And that in no event...

1592
02:53:36,396 --> 02:53:39,474
is she to be allowed the
opportunity to see my mother...

1593
02:53:39,499 --> 02:53:42,793
or create any disturbance at the house
before she leaves.

1594
02:53:43,219 --> 02:53:44,428
Yes, My Lord.

1595
02:54:57,121 --> 02:54:59,080
Ah, Mrs. Barry, how do you do?

1596
02:54:59,962 --> 02:55:02,047
How nice to see you, Graham.
Come in.

1597
02:55:02,215 --> 02:55:03,256
Thank you.

1598
02:55:04,926 --> 02:55:07,803
You, uh... You received my note?

1599
02:55:08,137 --> 02:55:09,638
Yes, we were expecting you.

1600
02:55:09,806 --> 02:55:12,516
Oh, good, good, I didn't want
to call unannounced.

1601
02:55:13,810 --> 02:55:15,811
Mr. Lyndon, how are you feeling?

1602
02:55:17,814 --> 02:55:20,482
I'm feeling much better,
thank you, Graham.

1603
02:55:21,818 --> 02:55:23,026
Won't you sit down?

1604
02:55:23,194 --> 02:55:24,736
Thank you, Mrs. Barry.

1605
02:55:33,487 --> 02:55:34,913
Would you like some tea?

1606
02:55:34,938 --> 02:55:38,914
Oh, no! No, thank you, Mrs. Barry.
Not just now.

1607
02:55:44,006 --> 02:55:46,091
How's the world treating you, Graham?

1608
02:55:46,259 --> 02:55:48,319
Oh, not too bad.

1609
02:55:49,554 --> 02:55:50,846
And, uh...

1610
02:55:51,013 --> 02:55:52,973
Are you comfortable here?

1611
02:55:53,141 --> 02:55:54,433
Most comfortable.

1612
02:55:54,600 --> 02:55:55,851
Good, good!

1613
02:56:04,026 --> 02:56:05,402
Well, uh...

1614
02:56:06,529 --> 02:56:07,696
Shall, uh...

1615
02:56:10,199 --> 02:56:12,784
Shall we get down to the matter at hand?

1616
02:56:14,745 --> 02:56:15,954
By all means.

1617
02:56:16,664 --> 02:56:17,789
Yes.

1618
02:56:19,625 --> 02:56:20,876
Well...

1619
02:56:22,587 --> 02:56:23,753
Mr. Lyndon...

1620
02:56:26,757 --> 02:56:29,983
Lord Bullingdon has instructed me...

1621
02:56:30,428 --> 02:56:33,889
to offer you an annuity...

1622
02:56:34,390 --> 02:56:38,435
of 500 guineas a year for life.

1623
02:56:40,518 --> 02:56:43,996
Specifically on the condition of your...

1624
02:56:45,735 --> 02:56:47,319
leaving England...

1625
02:56:47,945 --> 02:56:50,918
and to be stopped...

1626
02:56:51,741 --> 02:56:54,345
the instant of your return.

1627
02:56:57,038 --> 02:57:01,374
Lord Bullingdon has also asked me
to point out to you...

1628
02:57:02,793 --> 02:57:05,420
that should you decide to remain here...

1629
02:57:06,130 --> 02:57:09,883
your stay would infallibly plunge you...

1630
02:57:11,594 --> 02:57:13,470
into jail.

1631
02:57:15,139 --> 02:57:20,372
As in view of the present circumstances
there will soon be...

1632
02:57:20,811 --> 02:57:23,980
innumerable writs taken out
against you for...

1633
02:57:24,440 --> 02:57:26,566
debts long-outstanding...

1634
02:57:27,818 --> 02:57:30,487
and your credit is so blown that...

1635
02:57:31,989 --> 02:57:33,657
you could not hope...

1636
02:57:34,283 --> 02:57:35,909
to raise a shilling.

1637
02:58:06,566 --> 02:58:09,159
<i>Utterly baffled and beaten...</i>

1638
02:58:10,528 --> 02:58:13,488
<i>what was the lonely
and broken-hearted man to do?</i>

1639
02:58:15,449 --> 02:58:19,202
<i>He took the annuity and returned
to Ireland with his mother...</i>

1640
02:58:19,870 --> 02:58:21,538
<i>to complete his recovery.</i>

1641
02:58:23,040 --> 02:58:25,667
<i>Sometime later he
travelled to the continent.</i>

1642
02:58:27,670 --> 02:58:31,464
<i>His life there, we have not the means
of following accurately.</i>

1643
02:58:32,383 --> 02:58:35,885
<i>He appears to have resumed
his former profession of a gambler...</i>

1644
02:58:36,053 --> 02:58:38,013
<i>without his former success.</i>

1645
02:58:39,515 --> 02:58:41,558
<i>He never saw Lady Lyndon again.</i>
