1
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:51,574
Let us in! Let us in!

2
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:15,580
Excuse me.

3
00:05:31,875 --> 00:05:33,992
Get rid of them.
I don't want to see them.

4
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,768
Darling, don't be difficult.

5
00:05:35,792 --> 00:05:40,833
Let's take our sweet,
lovely children on an outing!

6
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,414
Cor, I've not seen
anything like that, mate.

7
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:55,285
You can't do this. I know my rights.

8
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,548
I have the authority to close
you down, and I'm doing just that.

9
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,368
This exhibit degrades
everybody who sees it,

10
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,040
as well as the poor creature himself.

11
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,082
He is a freak.

12
00:06:05,167 --> 00:06:06,499
How else will he live?

13
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,684
Freaks are one thing.
There's no objection to freaks.

14
00:06:08,708 --> 00:06:09,893
But this is entirely different!

15
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:12,830
This is monstrous,
and should not be allowed!

16
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,518
These officers will see to it that you
are on your way as soon as possible.

17
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,783
Good day!

18
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,833
Move along, please.
This way, gentlemen.

19
00:06:24,417 --> 00:06:28,081
Hold it there, sir. Come this way?

20
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,250
On the move again...

21
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:48,703
My treasure.

22
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:30,331
We'll be seeing a lot more of these
machine accidents, Mr. Hodges.

23
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:31,539
Yes, sir.

24
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,916
Abominable things, these machines,

25
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,616
but you can't reason with them.

26
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:42,033
What a mess.

27
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,083
Pull on the rope.

28
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,162
Irons, please.

29
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,411
Who is it?

30
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:11,864
- Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
- Yes, what is it?

31
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:15,906
- I found it.
- Good. Did you see it?

32
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,666
- No.
- All right.

33
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,951
I'll see you in a moment. Thank you.

34
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:28,368
- Who's that?
- A friend of mine.

35
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,661
Oh, yes?

36
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:34,375
- What are you up to, Treves?
- Nothing.

37
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,450
Ah, come on, Freddie!

38
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,992
Nothing of any importance.

39
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:36,079
Do you know where Green Street is?

40
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:39,990
It's round the back, to the left,
then to the right, then straight through.

41
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,244
Thank you.

42
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,664
- Are you the proprietor?
- And who might you be, sir?

43
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:07,656
Just one of the curious.
I'd like to see it.

44
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:13,907
I don't think so.
No, sir, we're...

45
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,790
...closed.

46
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:19,947
Now, I'd pay handsomely
for a private showing.

47
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:23,618
- Are you the proprietor?
- Handsomely? Who sent you?

48
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,333
- I beg your pardon?
- Never mind.

49
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:31,699
I'm the...

50
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,991
...owner.

51
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:56,078
Life...

52
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:02,125
is full of surprises.

53
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:08,541
Consider the fate

54
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,496
of this creature's poor mother,

55
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,245
struck down,

56
00:13:16,292 --> 00:13:19,330
in the fourth month
of her maternal condition

57
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:20,874
by an elephant.

58
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,665
A wild elephant.

59
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,825
Struck down...

60
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:30,494
on an uncharted African isle.

61
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,366
The result...

62
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,538
is plain to see.

63
00:13:39,292 --> 00:13:41,500
Ladies and gentlemen,

64
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:44,824
the terrible...

65
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,574
Elephant...

66
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,083
Man!

67
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,582
- Stand up!
- Stand up!

68
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:17,289
- Turn round!
- Turn around! Turn around!

69
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,325
Yes, um... you'll bring him to me
tomorrow morning at ten, Mr., er...?

70
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:07,455
Bytes. He'll be there.

71
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:10,078
Good.

72
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:17,332
Now here's my card,
and I'll send a cab. All right?

73
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,458
We have a deal.

74
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:25,448
We understand each other.

75
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,993
More than money has changed hands.

76
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:32,705
We understand each other
completely, my friend.

77
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,663
Yes. Well, thank you, Mr. Bytes.

78
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:38,325
Thank you. Tomorrow.
Thank you.

79
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,333
Cor, what a stink!

80
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:21,125
I'm looking for a Mr. Frederick Treves,

81
00:16:21,292 --> 00:16:22,954
please, ma'am.

82
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:28,285
Very well, I'll send for him. Nurse!

83
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,334
Oh, Mr. Treves, sir, this, um...

84
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,957
- this, um...
- Yes.

85
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:36,490
- He says that, um...
- Thank you. Yes, I was expecting him.

86
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,207
Yes, are you the cab driver?

87
00:16:39,292 --> 00:16:41,329
- Yes, sir.
- Anyone else with you?

88
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:44,831
- No, sir, just this gentleman.
- Thank you for your troubles.

89
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:49,742
- Not at all, sir. My pleasure.
- Thank you.

90
00:16:51,542 --> 00:16:53,158
Will you come this way, please?

91
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,906
Mrs. Mothershead, I'll be in my room
and I'm not to be disturbed, all right?

92
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,083
Of course, sir.

93
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,958
Will you come with me, please?

94
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,707
You heard what the doctor said?

95
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,367
Go on!

96
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,581
Um...

97
00:17:55,042 --> 00:17:56,408
Um...

98
00:17:58,417 --> 00:17:59,999
My name is Frederick Treves,

99
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:02,996
and I am the surgeon here
at the London Hospital,

100
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:05,158
and, um...

101
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:10,451
I lecture in anatomy
at the, um... medical college.

102
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,369
So...

103
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,243
I'd like very much to examine you,
so that, um...

104
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:20,333
er...

105
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,950
I mean, would that be all right?

106
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:26,040
Please.

107
00:18:28,792 --> 00:18:30,078
Er...

108
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:32,750
First, I...
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

109
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:36,326
Um... would that be all right?

110
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,200
Now, your owner tells me...
I mean the man who...

111
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:42,074
looks after you
tells me that, er...

112
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,867
you're English
and that your name is John Merrick.

113
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,409
John Merrick, is that right?

114
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:57,706
I tell you what, I think
I'll ask you a question, and, um...

115
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:01,372
you shake your head
like this for, er...

116
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,866
'no'.

117
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:04,499
Um...

118
00:19:04,917 --> 00:19:07,751
Have you always been
the way you are now?

119
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,708
Are you in any pain?

120
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:15,829
Are your parents still alive?

121
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,207
Do you understand me?

122
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:21,826
Your father, your mother,
are they dead?

123
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:25,449
Freddie, what are you doing for...?

124
00:19:25,542 --> 00:19:29,491
Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry.
I had no idea you had...

125
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,703
Freddie, Freddie, what the hell
have you got in there?

126
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,992
You'll know soon enough at the
meeting of the Society.

127
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,996
Until then, I beg of you,
not a word to anyone, please.

128
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:42,042
All right, if you insist.
But you must have quite a find in there.

129
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:46,281
- I don't know what I've got.
- "Nothing of any importance", eh?

130
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:50,948
Not a word, please, Fox.
Not a word.

131
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,536
All right.

132
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:00,741
Thank you.

133
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:33,243
It's all right.

134
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:48,376
I think I'll examine you now.

135
00:20:48,792 --> 00:20:51,626
I'll leave the questions till later.

136
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,164
All right?

137
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,333
Will you take your hat off
for me, please?

138
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:01,033
Now, don't be frightened.

139
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,165
I simply want to look at you.

140
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:06,454
Take your hat off.

141
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,582
Don't be frightened.

142
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:20,665
Thank you.

143
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,367
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

144
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,662
Mr. Thomas, Mr. Rogers.

145
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,992
Pull the curtains aside.

146
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,957
He is English.

147
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:46,076
He is 21 years of age,

148
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:48,791
and his name is John Merrick.

149
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,743
Gentlemen, in the course
of my profession I have come upon

150
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:57,622
many lamentable deformities
of the face due to injury or disease,

151
00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:00,955
as well as mutilations and
contortions of the body

152
00:22:01,042 --> 00:22:02,829
depending upon like causes.

153
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,991
But at no time have I
met with such a

154
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:08,076
perverted or degraded version
of a human being as this man.

155
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:10,290
Now, I wish to draw
your attention to the

156
00:22:10,375 --> 00:22:12,241
insidious conditions
affecting this patient.

157
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,733
- Can you see over there?
- Yes, thank you.

158
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,997
Note, if you will,
the extreme enlargement of the skull,

159
00:22:18,875 --> 00:22:21,743
the right upper limb,
which is totally useless,

160
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:24,075
the alarming curvature of the spine.

161
00:22:24,167 --> 00:22:25,533
Would you turn round, please?

162
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,499
Turn round, please.

163
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:32,329
The looseness of the skin,

164
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:37,199
and the varying fibrous tumours
that cover 90% of the body.

165
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:41,831
And there is every indication that these
afflictions have been in existence,

166
00:22:42,083 --> 00:22:45,372
and have progressed rapidly,
since birth.

167
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:47,871
The patient also suffers
from chronic bronchitis.

168
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:49,832
As an interesting side note,

169
00:22:49,917 --> 00:22:52,034
in spite of the
aforementioned anomalies,

170
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:57,075
the patient's genitals
remain entirely intact and unaffected.

171
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,991
Thank you.

172
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,164
And his left arm is
perfectly normal, as you see.

173
00:23:07,542 --> 00:23:08,908
So, then, gentlemen,

174
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,368
owing to this series of conditions,
the congenital exostosis of the skull,

175
00:23:12,458 --> 00:23:13,698
extensive papillomatous growth,

176
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,288
large pendulous masses
in connection with the skin,

177
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:18,324
the great enlargement of
the right upper limb

178
00:23:18,417 --> 00:23:19,749
involving all the bones,

179
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:22,993
the massive distortion of the head,
and the extensive area

180
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:25,830
covered by papillomatous growth,

181
00:23:26,292 --> 00:23:29,615
the patient has been called
"the Elephant Man".

182
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,457
Thank you.

183
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:02,326
You never mentioned his mental state.

184
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,458
Oh, he's an imbecile,
probably from birth.

185
00:24:05,542 --> 00:24:07,374
The man's a complete idiot.

186
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:10,574
Pray to God he's an idiot.

187
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,491
Where have you been?

188
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,207
Get out.

189
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:59,996
How can I eat with a noise like that?

190
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:11,324
Bytes, don't!

191
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:16,956
Where have you been?
What did you do?

192
00:25:21,792 --> 00:25:24,705
- Our man's sick. Come right away.
- What is it?

193
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:28,747
Like this...

194
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,823
- What did you do with him?
- He's been like this all night.

195
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:37,493
He was fine when he left here.
Now look at him!

196
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,704
Yes, I intend to.

197
00:25:41,292 --> 00:25:44,035
- What happened?
- He fell.

198
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,707
He... falls.

199
00:25:54,792 --> 00:25:56,658
Looks like he's had
a very severe fall.

200
00:25:58,208 --> 00:25:59,949
He's a...

201
00:26:00,042 --> 00:26:01,533
clumsy soul.

202
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:04,033
Never looks where he's going.

203
00:26:04,458 --> 00:26:07,951
But that's all right.
He has me to take care of him.

204
00:26:08,875 --> 00:26:11,117
Why is he sitting up like this?
He needs rest!

205
00:26:12,292 --> 00:26:14,284
Well, that's how he sleeps.

206
00:26:14,667 --> 00:26:17,990
If he lies down, he'll kill himself.

207
00:26:18,417 --> 00:26:20,374
His...

208
00:26:20,458 --> 00:26:21,665
head's too big.

209
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:26,032
All right.
This man belongs in a hospital.

210
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:28,787
Can't you treat him here?

211
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:30,992
Listen, he's my livelihood.

212
00:26:31,292 --> 00:26:32,408
We're...

213
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:34,624
business partners, he and I.

214
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:41,164
- He's the greatest freak in the world!
- Yes, now you listen.

215
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:43,958
You're not going to have
much of a livelihood if he dies.

216
00:26:44,042 --> 00:26:46,204
Now stop wasting my time.
I'm going to fetch a cab.

217
00:26:46,292 --> 00:26:49,660
I truly appreciate this, my friend.

218
00:26:50,083 --> 00:26:51,790
Listen, um...

219
00:26:52,167 --> 00:26:54,705
there are a lot of things
I could do for you.

220
00:26:54,792 --> 00:26:57,956
You see, I move in the
proper circles for...

221
00:26:58,458 --> 00:27:00,450
this type of thing.

222
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:02,158
In fact...

223
00:27:02,625 --> 00:27:05,743
anything at all,
if you take my meaning.

224
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:11,622
- Everything will be taken care of.
- It's good to do business with you.

225
00:27:35,042 --> 00:27:38,456
Here we go. Here we go.

226
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,948
Shhh...

227
00:28:57,292 --> 00:29:00,000
- Can I have a bowl of oatmeal, please?
- Yes, sir.

228
00:29:01,167 --> 00:29:04,035
Breakfasting with the
patients this morning, Mr. Treves?

229
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:06,208
Yes... no, I, it's for a patient.

230
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:08,158
There you are, sir.

231
00:29:09,417 --> 00:29:11,955
- Thank you. Good morning.
- Morning.

232
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:19,455
Oh, Treves!
Just come here for a moment, will you?

233
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,491
Um...

234
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,116
What's that you've got there?

235
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:33,074
Good Heavens!

236
00:29:33,167 --> 00:29:36,205
You haven't acquired a sudden taste
for this sort of stuff, have you?

237
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:39,160
- Yes, sir, it's quite nutritious.
- Possibly.

238
00:29:39,542 --> 00:29:42,990
Not quite the diet for
a grown man. Nurse!

239
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:47,952
When you have a moment,
just take this up to the patient

240
00:29:48,042 --> 00:29:50,659
in the isolation ward, will you?

241
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,661
Yes, sir.

242
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:56,870
Don't be frightened.
He won't hurt you.

243
00:29:58,458 --> 00:30:00,620
Won't he, indeed?
Now, just a minute, Treves.

244
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:03,371
Something I want to say to you.
Come in.

245
00:30:05,958 --> 00:30:09,076
A hospital's no place for secrecy,
you know, Mr. Treves.

246
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,038
Doctors spiriting hooded figures
about in the corridors

247
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:13,787
is apt to cause comment.

248
00:30:13,875 --> 00:30:16,037
Why wasn't this patient
properly admitted?

249
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:18,082
Why is he in the isolation ward?

250
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:20,705
- He's not contagious, is he?
- Oh no, sir.

251
00:30:20,792 --> 00:30:22,704
No, he's got chronic bronchitis

252
00:30:22,792 --> 00:30:24,328
and he's been badly beaten.

253
00:30:24,417 --> 00:30:26,177
Well, why isn't he in
the General Ward, then?

254
00:30:27,083 --> 00:30:28,199
Well, sir, he's...

255
00:30:28,292 --> 00:30:30,750
he's quite seriously deformed,
and, um...

256
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:33,166
I fear the other patients
would find him rather shocking.

257
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,950
Deformed, is that it?

258
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:39,206
Am I to assume, then, that
he is ultimately incurable?

259
00:30:39,292 --> 00:30:41,625
- Yes, sir.
- But you must be aware, Mr. Treves,

260
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:43,351
that this hospital
doesn't accept incurables.

261
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,412
The rules are perfectly clear
on that point.

262
00:30:45,667 --> 00:30:50,332
Yes sir, I'm well aware of that.
But this case is quite, quite exceptional.

263
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:14,743
Yes, I quite appreciate
your problem, Mr. Treves.

264
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:19,373
Why not contact the British Home
or the Royal Hospital for Incurables?

265
00:31:19,458 --> 00:31:21,165
Perhaps they might
find a place for him.

266
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,913
Yes, I'll look into it.
Would you like to meet him?

267
00:31:40,958 --> 00:31:42,074
Excuse me!

268
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,366
The Elephant Man.

269
00:31:52,042 --> 00:31:53,249
Sorry.

270
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:55,083
Sorry.

271
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,116
I should have warned you.

272
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:04,912
Please forgive me.

273
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,492
- You all right?
- Yes, sir.

274
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:12,416
Please ask Mrs. Mothershead
to come up here,

275
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:16,164
and tell her to knock on the door,
and wait for me.

276
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:29,829
I'm sorry about that. I, er...

277
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:35,827
We'll bring you another breakfast.
I'm sure you must be very hungry.

278
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:37,574
And, er...

279
00:32:37,667 --> 00:32:40,455
I think you'll be
quite comfortable here, for a while.

280
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:43,291
I'll see to it that you have
everything you need.

281
00:36:04,583 --> 00:36:05,619
Cor blimey!

282
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:12,074
So...

283
00:36:13,042 --> 00:36:14,829
this is the Elephant Man.

284
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:19,288
I ain't seen nothing like you before.

285
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:23,541
What the bleedin' hell
happened to yer?

286
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,832
Dumb, eh?

287
00:36:31,292 --> 00:36:34,000
I like people that can keep quiet.

288
00:36:37,417 --> 00:36:40,285
'ere, have a drink.

289
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,832
Go on!

290
00:36:44,917 --> 00:36:45,998
No?

291
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,913
You should be more sociable, mate.

292
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,162
Get yourself disliked.

293
00:37:02,292 --> 00:37:03,749
You and I...

294
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:05,244
are gonna be good friends.

295
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:07,996
And I've got a lot of friends
who'd like to meet you.

296
00:37:08,417 --> 00:37:10,204
And they will, mate.

297
00:37:10,292 --> 00:37:13,160
Believe me, they will.

298
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:28,322
I've brought your breakfast.
What are you doing down there?

299
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,583
Come on, up on the bed.

300
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:31,828
Come on!

301
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:11,406
- All he understands is a good smack.
- He's had his share of smacks.

302
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:13,499
I'm sure that's what
drives him under the bed.

303
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,745
You have to treat him
with kindness and patience.

304
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:20,032
Well, perhaps you've got time
for that sort of treatment, Mr. Treves,

305
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:23,239
but I haven't.
I've got a hospital to run.

306
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:26,121
Now, don't you waste your time
with him, sir.

307
00:38:26,917 --> 00:38:30,081
It's like talking to a brick wall.

308
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,743
I don't mean to be harsh, but...

309
00:38:34,958 --> 00:38:37,575
he doesn't belong here.

310
00:38:38,792 --> 00:38:40,579
Well, honestly, sir...

311
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:43,833
honestly, what can you do for him?

312
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,955
Oh, and by the way,
Mr. Carr Gomm said, er...

313
00:39:00,042 --> 00:39:02,750
he would like to see you
when you can spare a moment.

314
00:39:02,917 --> 00:39:04,283
- Yes.
- Right.

315
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:13,413
Can't help you unless you help me.

316
00:39:22,208 --> 00:39:25,576
I believe there's something
that you want to say to me.

317
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,582
Something back there.

318
00:39:28,375 --> 00:39:31,823
Can't help you
unless you help me, you know?

319
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:37,701
I believe you want to say
something to me, don't you?

320
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:42,664
I've got to understand what you're feeling,
I've got to understand what you're thinking.

321
00:39:44,042 --> 00:39:45,954
Do you understand me?

322
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:52,622
All right, just nod your head.
Can you understand me? Just...

323
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,743
just nod your head
if you understand me.

324
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:02,040
All right.

325
00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:05,454
You do understand.

326
00:40:06,083 --> 00:40:08,666
Now, I want to hear you talk.

327
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,630
We're going to show them
that you're not a wall.

328
00:40:10,667 --> 00:40:13,705
Do you understand?
I want you to talk to me.

329
00:40:14,875 --> 00:40:16,457
All right, now.

330
00:40:16,542 --> 00:40:18,158
I want to hear you say it.

331
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,791
I've got to hear how you say things.

332
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:23,868
I'm not going to hurt you, but I've got
to understand how you say things.

333
00:40:24,042 --> 00:40:25,578
I've got to hear them!

334
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:29,747
Very slowly, I want you to say "yes".

335
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:32,491
Say "yes".

336
00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:40,075
Yes.

337
00:40:40,792 --> 00:40:42,203
Yes!

338
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:45,291
Good. All right.

339
00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:48,868
Now, just once more.
Say it again: "yes".

340
00:40:50,333 --> 00:40:52,620
Yes...

341
00:40:53,042 --> 00:40:56,206
Yes, I can understand that.
That's good!

342
00:40:58,125 --> 00:40:59,957
That's very good.
All right, now,

343
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:03,121
I'm going to say some words to you,
and I want you to repeat them.

344
00:41:03,208 --> 00:41:04,870
Do you understand?

345
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:09,744
Say "Hello, my name is..."

346
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,536
Hello.

347
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:19,746
My name is...

348
00:41:20,167 --> 00:41:22,250
"John Merrick."

349
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,207
...on... errick.

350
00:41:25,375 --> 00:41:27,458
No... "John"...

351
00:41:27,542 --> 00:41:30,740
That's very good.
Say "John Merrick".

352
00:41:33,667 --> 00:41:35,158
Merrick.

353
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:39,369
"Hello, my name is John Merrick".

354
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:44,914
Hello, my name...

355
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:48,951
is John Merrick.

356
00:41:49,083 --> 00:41:50,369
You can speak!

357
00:41:59,042 --> 00:42:01,830
How did you get up here?

358
00:42:02,458 --> 00:42:05,246
- I want my man back.
- Just a moment. How did you get up...

359
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:08,076
Never mind that. I want my man.

360
00:42:09,042 --> 00:42:11,250
He's still very sick.

361
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:13,559
Please, come downstairs with me,
and I'll explain the situation.

362
00:42:13,583 --> 00:42:15,245
Don't!

363
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,741
Don't.

364
00:42:19,208 --> 00:42:21,951
You've had plenty of time to...

365
00:42:22,917 --> 00:42:24,078
cure him.

366
00:42:24,958 --> 00:42:27,575
And now, he's leaving with me.

367
00:42:28,167 --> 00:42:30,750
Do you understand me?

368
00:42:30,958 --> 00:42:33,166
Now, Mr. Treves.

369
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:36,743
- We made a deal.
- You misunderstood.

370
00:42:36,875 --> 00:42:39,583
This man has suffered a severe fall.

371
00:42:39,667 --> 00:42:41,533
If you take my meaning.

372
00:42:41,917 --> 00:42:45,490
- Now, he's my patient now.
- Pull the other one, why don't you?

373
00:42:45,917 --> 00:42:51,163
Mr. Bytes, I'm sorry. But all you do
is profit from another man's misery.

374
00:42:52,625 --> 00:42:56,164
- You think you're better than me?
- No, I don't.

375
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:59,084
You wanted the freak

376
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:03,414
to show to those doctor chums of yours,
to make a name for yourself.

377
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:06,413
You, my friend...

378
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:09,875
I gave you the freak...

379
00:43:10,458 --> 00:43:11,574
on trust.

380
00:43:12,292 --> 00:43:15,251
In the name of... science.

381
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:17,116
And now I want him back.

382
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:19,416
You do not own this man.
Now, stop it!

383
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,287
I want him back!

384
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:24,393
So you can beat him?
So you can starve him?

385
00:43:24,417 --> 00:43:27,160
A dog in the streets
would fare better with you.

386
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,768
I shall go to the authorities.

387
00:43:28,792 --> 00:43:30,749
Go to the authorities, then!

388
00:43:30,833 --> 00:43:32,324
Go to them, by all means.

389
00:43:32,625 --> 00:43:36,448
I'm sure they'll be very interested
to hear your story as well as ours.

390
00:43:37,458 --> 00:43:38,994
Now...

391
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:43,494
I think we really do
understand one another.

392
00:43:44,542 --> 00:43:45,999
Hmm?

393
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,582
All right.

394
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:52,699
All right.

395
00:44:03,667 --> 00:44:07,286
A singularly unattractive character,
I must say!

396
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:13,291
Well, Treves, it seems to me I might
as well meet this patient of yours.

397
00:44:13,375 --> 00:44:16,209
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

398
00:44:16,958 --> 00:44:18,324
Um...

399
00:44:18,833 --> 00:44:21,075
Well, shall we say
in a few days, then?

400
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:23,412
Shall we say two o'clock
tomorrow afternoon?

401
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:26,491
Um...

402
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:30,365
Yes... well, whatever's
most convenient for you, sir.

403
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:32,824
Two o'clock, then, tomorrow.

404
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:34,908
Thank you very much.

405
00:44:39,333 --> 00:44:41,074
Two o'clock!

406
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:45,617
- Morning, Charles.
- Morning, Mr Treves.

407
00:44:45,708 --> 00:44:47,870
- Early again, I see?
- Yes.

408
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:51,288
With these early habits of yours,
you'd have made a good milkman!

409
00:44:51,667 --> 00:44:54,739
- I'll keep that in mind, Charles.
- Okay, sir.

410
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,083
"He restoreth my soul.

411
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:11,165
- He leadeth me into paths of...
- for his name's sake."

412
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:14,622
"Righteousness."
Righteousness.

413
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:19,869
"He leadeth me in the paths of

414
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,573
righteousness for his name's sake."

415
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:25,742
Good. That's very good.

416
00:45:26,167 --> 00:45:28,409
Good. Now, when
your visitor comes today,

417
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,413
I want you to say it exactly the way
you've said it just now.

418
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:35,915
When I introduce him to you,
just say the words you've learned.

419
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:38,309
If you have trouble with any of
the words, I'll help you,

420
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:39,869
so there's nothing to worry about.

421
00:45:40,208 --> 00:45:44,748
I'll introduce you to him and say:
"Please meet Mr. Carr Gomm."

422
00:45:44,917 --> 00:45:46,829
And you will say:

423
00:45:47,625 --> 00:45:51,915
Hello, my name is John Merrick.

424
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:55,159
I'm very pleased to meet you.

425
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,242
Good. Good.

426
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:01,117
I'll go and get Mr. Carr Gomm.

427
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:12,700
Now, it is only a physical problem.
He has trouble with certain sounds

428
00:46:12,792 --> 00:46:15,990
because of the
constrictive deformity of the mouth.

429
00:46:16,083 --> 00:46:18,575
- But he can talk...
- Well, talking's one thing, Treves,

430
00:46:18,708 --> 00:46:21,371
but is he able to understand
what's said to him?

431
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:24,075
Yes. Oh, yes. Except...

432
00:46:24,625 --> 00:46:28,574
Except he's so anxious
to make a good impression on you

433
00:46:28,667 --> 00:46:30,750
that he might seem a little nervous.

434
00:46:48,542 --> 00:46:50,158
Come in.

435
00:47:02,417 --> 00:47:05,535
John?

436
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,742
May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm?

437
00:47:08,833 --> 00:47:12,656
Mr. Carr Gomm, this is John Merrick.

438
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:18,041
Hello... my name is John Merrick,
I'm very pleased to meet you.

439
00:47:18,667 --> 00:47:20,909
I'm very pleased to meet you.

440
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:27,908
- How are you feeling today?
- I feel much better.

441
00:47:29,417 --> 00:47:32,034
Are you comfortable here?

442
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:37,243
Everybody's been very kind.

443
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:40,371
How is your bronchitis?

444
00:47:52,375 --> 00:47:54,913
Mr. Merrick likes
the food here, don't you?

445
00:47:59,583 --> 00:48:04,533
- Much better than what I'm used to.
- Oh yes?

446
00:48:05,833 --> 00:48:07,620
Yes, and what was that?

447
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:12,199
Potatoes.

448
00:48:13,833 --> 00:48:16,621
I understood that you'd been flogged?

449
00:48:18,917 --> 00:48:22,740
I feel much better now.

450
00:48:23,042 --> 00:48:26,911
That's splendid.
How do you find Mr. Treves?

451
00:48:27,042 --> 00:48:30,490
As a teacher, I mean?

452
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:40,329
He's very kind.

453
00:48:42,167 --> 00:48:46,081
How long did you and Mr. Treves
prepare for this interview?

454
00:48:53,417 --> 00:48:56,615
Everybody's... very kind.

455
00:48:58,042 --> 00:49:00,250
Yes, of course, I understand. Well,

456
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:02,495
it's been a pleasure meeting you,
Mr. Merrick.

457
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,411
Good day to you.

458
00:49:14,458 --> 00:49:17,246
Very good, John.
It was very good.

459
00:49:18,292 --> 00:49:20,249
I'll be back in a moment.

460
00:49:24,083 --> 00:49:27,121
"The Lord is my shepherd,

461
00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:30,742
I shall not want.

462
00:49:31,542 --> 00:49:33,579
He maketh me lie down..."

463
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:35,537
Well, it was a brave attempt, Treves,

464
00:49:35,625 --> 00:49:38,163
but the man was obviously
simply mouthing words taught by you.

465
00:49:38,292 --> 00:49:41,785
Yes. Well I'm sorry
to have wasted your time.

466
00:49:42,583 --> 00:49:45,200
"He restoreth my soul."

467
00:49:45,458 --> 00:49:46,790
He simply doesn't belong here.

468
00:49:46,875 --> 00:49:50,289
He'd be much better off somewhere else
where he can be constantly looked after.

469
00:49:50,417 --> 00:49:53,410
I'm sorry, Treves, that things have
turned out this way. Good day to you.

470
00:49:53,917 --> 00:49:55,328
"Yea,

471
00:49:56,083 --> 00:50:01,704
though I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death, I fear no evil,

472
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:06,494
for Thou art with me, Thy rod and Thy staff..."

473
00:50:06,917 --> 00:50:08,624
Mr. Carr Gomm!

474
00:50:10,417 --> 00:50:12,033
Yes, what is it?

475
00:50:13,542 --> 00:50:15,283
It's that!

476
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:20,083
I didn't teach him that part!

477
00:50:21,625 --> 00:50:27,747
"Goodness and mercy
will follow me all the days of my life

478
00:50:27,917 --> 00:50:33,413
and I shall dwell
in the house of the Lord forever."

479
00:50:37,208 --> 00:50:40,451
How did you know the rest of it?
I didn't teach you the rest of it.

480
00:50:40,542 --> 00:50:42,124
It's very strange.

481
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:47,577
Tell me, how did you know
the rest of it - the 23rd Psalm?

482
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:57,079
I used to read the Bible every day.

483
00:50:58,250 --> 00:51:03,245
I know it very well,
and the Book of Common Prayer.

484
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:08,745
The 23rd Psalm's beautiful.
It's my favourite.

485
00:51:11,417 --> 00:51:14,251
Treves, come and see me in my office
when you're through up here.

486
00:51:14,417 --> 00:51:17,034
There's something important
I want to say to you.

487
00:51:18,083 --> 00:51:21,747
Goodbye, Mr. Merrick.
I do hope we shall meet again.

488
00:51:31,708 --> 00:51:34,246
Why didn't you tell me you can read?

489
00:51:35,917 --> 00:51:38,204
I was frightened.

490
00:51:39,917 --> 00:51:46,118
- Oh, I see.
- I was afraid to talk.

491
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:51,708
Please forgive me.

492
00:52:02,375 --> 00:52:05,038
Can you imagine the kind of life
he must have had?

493
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:08,952
- Yes, I think I can.
- I don't believe so.

494
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:13,156
No-one could possibly imagine it.
I don't believe any of us can.

495
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,741
"Terrible though his appearance is,

496
00:52:25,833 --> 00:52:29,782
so terrible indeed,
that women and nervous persons

497
00:52:29,875 --> 00:52:33,539
fly in horror from the sight of him,

498
00:52:33,667 --> 00:52:36,660
and that he is debarred from
seeking to earn his livelihood

499
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:38,742
in any ordinary way.

500
00:52:38,917 --> 00:52:43,161
Yet he is superior in intelligence.
He can read and write,

501
00:52:43,292 --> 00:52:48,708
is quiet, gentle, not to say
even refined in his mind."

502
00:52:57,167 --> 00:53:00,490
I should very much like
to meet this gentleman.

503
00:53:27,292 --> 00:53:29,454
- Have you seen this?
- No.

504
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:40,414
- Now listen to this!
- Hey up, hey up!

505
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,911
Hey up!

506
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:48,201
Now listen. This is a letter

507
00:53:48,292 --> 00:53:52,662
to the London Times
from the governor of the 'ospital.

508
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,334
"There is now, in a little room
off one of our attic wards

509
00:53:56,417 --> 00:53:58,909
a man named John Merrick,

510
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,242
so dreadful a sight, that he is unable

511
00:54:01,333 --> 00:54:04,405
even to come out
by daylight to the garden.

512
00:54:05,167 --> 00:54:09,992
He has been called the Elephant Man
on account of his terrible deformity.

513
00:54:10,417 --> 00:54:14,991
His appearance is so terrible,
that women and nervous persons

514
00:54:15,083 --> 00:54:17,746
fly in terror at the sight of him."

515
00:54:20,792 --> 00:54:23,500
And how do you get tickets to see him?

516
00:54:23,583 --> 00:54:26,872
- Your very own Sunny Jim!
- Well, let's go and see him, then!

517
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,323
All right, keep your shirt on.
The time must be right.

518
00:54:32,125 --> 00:54:34,333
Right now, he's in the attic,

519
00:54:34,417 --> 00:54:38,036
but tomorrow they're gonna
move him to Bedstead Square,

520
00:54:38,125 --> 00:54:43,075
right into my lap.
Then, for the right price,

521
00:54:43,167 --> 00:54:49,084
you will see something you'll
never ever see again in your life!

522
00:55:38,292 --> 00:55:39,828
Well, don't look so glum, girls!

523
00:55:39,917 --> 00:55:43,456
Enthusiastic volunteers should be
more cheerful, hmm?

524
00:55:44,667 --> 00:55:46,579
Put your collar straight, girl!

525
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,742
And remember...

526
00:55:49,958 --> 00:55:54,874
that under no circumstances whatsoever

527
00:55:56,708 --> 00:55:58,870
are any mirrors to be
brought into this room.

528
00:55:58,958 --> 00:56:03,157
- Yes, Mrs. Mothershead.
- Yes.

529
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:05,241
Right.

530
00:56:10,833 --> 00:56:11,949
He's so ugly!

531
00:56:12,083 --> 00:56:15,076
Yeah, well, ugly or not,
you're gonna help me.

532
00:56:21,917 --> 00:56:24,079
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?

533
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:30,035
You look very nice in, er...
your new clothes.

534
00:56:30,917 --> 00:56:35,116
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah, well, if there's nothing else,

535
00:56:35,208 --> 00:56:38,576
- suppose we'll be leaving you now.
- No, there's nothing.

536
00:57:09,833 --> 00:57:11,415
You ready for tea?

537
00:57:12,958 --> 00:57:15,166
Please go in, John.

538
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,082
Make yourself comfortable.

539
00:57:30,042 --> 00:57:31,908
Oh...

540
00:57:36,083 --> 00:57:38,496
Anne, come along.
Meet our guest.

541
00:57:48,375 --> 00:57:50,742
Mr. Merrick, I'd like you
to meet my wife, Anne.

542
00:57:51,125 --> 00:57:53,788
Anne, this is John Merrick.

543
00:57:57,583 --> 00:58:00,200
I'm very pleased to meet you,
Mr. Merrick.

544
00:58:04,417 --> 00:58:05,658
I...

545
00:58:06,875 --> 00:58:09,413
I'm very pleased...

546
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:17,910
What is it? What's the matter?

547
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:22,367
It's just that I...

548
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:27,035
I'm not used to being

549
00:58:27,417 --> 00:58:30,410
treated so well by...

550
00:58:31,917 --> 00:58:34,409
a beautiful woman.

551
00:58:36,958 --> 00:58:40,201
Would you like a cup of tea,
Mr. Merrick?

552
00:58:40,292 --> 00:58:41,749
That's a good idea.

553
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:46,788
Would you like to come and see
the rest of the house?

554
00:58:46,917 --> 00:58:48,909
Come on, I'll show you.

555
00:59:00,625 --> 00:59:02,412
How's your tea?

556
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:07,749
It's very good.

557
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:14,322
I'm enjoying my visit here very much.

558
00:59:15,292 --> 00:59:19,912
It's so kind of you
to have me in your own home.

559
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:28,576
I'm sorry
that I made a spectacle of myself.

560
00:59:29,083 --> 00:59:30,574
No, not at all.

561
00:59:36,333 --> 00:59:38,495
I like the way that you've...

562
00:59:39,792 --> 00:59:42,205
arranged the pictures
on the mantelpiece.

563
00:59:42,417 --> 00:59:43,874
Oh, thank you.

564
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,913
Is that the way they do it
in most houses?

565
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:49,875
Yes, I'm sure they do, yes.

566
00:59:50,917 --> 00:59:53,000
Who... who are they of?

567
00:59:53,083 --> 00:59:57,953
Well, these are relatives
and these are our children.

568
00:59:58,417 --> 01:00:00,579
Children? Oh, may I see?

569
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:02,540
Yes, of course.

570
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:12,367
Where are the children?

571
01:00:13,458 --> 01:00:17,407
Well, um, they're...
out with friends at the moment.

572
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:20,207
Friends...

573
01:00:21,292 --> 01:00:24,126
And here is Frederick's mother.

574
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:32,706
And these are my parents.

575
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:41,535
They have such...

576
01:00:41,625 --> 01:00:43,457
noble faces.

577
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,868
Yes, I've always thought so myself.

578
01:00:50,333 --> 01:00:51,824
Would you...

579
01:00:53,833 --> 01:00:55,916
care to see my mother?

580
01:00:57,125 --> 01:00:58,707
Your mother?

581
01:01:00,208 --> 01:01:01,619
Yes, please.

582
01:01:10,375 --> 01:01:12,037
Oh, but she's...

583
01:01:13,667 --> 01:01:15,454
Mr. Merrick, she's beautiful!

584
01:01:15,875 --> 01:01:17,241
Oh, she has...

585
01:01:17,917 --> 01:01:21,615
She has the face of an angel.

586
01:01:30,375 --> 01:01:31,832
I must...

587
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:39,039
...have been a
great disappointment to her.

588
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,617
No, Mr. Merrick, no. No...

589
01:01:42,583 --> 01:01:45,496
No son as loving as you
could ever be a disappointment.

590
01:01:47,833 --> 01:01:51,122
If only I could find her!

591
01:01:51,542 --> 01:01:53,955
If she could see me...

592
01:01:54,042 --> 01:01:58,241
with such lovely friends, here, now,

593
01:01:58,375 --> 01:02:00,162
perhaps she could...

594
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:02,082
love me as I am.

595
01:02:03,875 --> 01:02:07,744
I've tried so hard to be good.

596
01:02:15,083 --> 01:02:16,540
Oh, I'm so sorry.

597
01:02:16,792 --> 01:02:19,455
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, please...

598
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:21,741
I'm so sorry.

599
01:02:22,792 --> 01:02:25,159
Oh, please.

600
01:03:03,875 --> 01:03:05,912
What's that you're doing?

601
01:03:09,042 --> 01:03:10,624
What is it?

602
01:03:13,375 --> 01:03:16,038
Oh, I see! It's St. Philip's!

603
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:18,875
Well that's very good!

604
01:03:18,958 --> 01:03:21,621
You've got the windows
and arches just right.

605
01:03:37,208 --> 01:03:39,370
I wish...

606
01:03:40,458 --> 01:03:42,700
I could sleep...

607
01:03:43,958 --> 01:03:45,745
like normal people.

608
01:03:52,833 --> 01:03:54,540
Mr. Treves,

609
01:03:56,583 --> 01:04:01,703
there's something that
I've been meaning to ask you

610
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:05,243
- for some time now.
- What's that?

611
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:08,412
Can you cure me?

612
01:04:09,958 --> 01:04:11,165
No.

613
01:04:12,542 --> 01:04:14,204
No, we, er...

614
01:04:14,292 --> 01:04:16,329
we can care for you,
but we...

615
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:18,199
we can't cure you.

616
01:04:20,083 --> 01:04:21,290
No.

617
01:04:22,875 --> 01:04:24,286
I thought not.

618
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,082
Come in.

619
01:04:38,167 --> 01:04:39,453
Ah, good morning.

620
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:42,823
Good morning.

621
01:04:42,917 --> 01:04:45,989
There's someone here who'd
like to meet you, if that's all right.

622
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:50,407
May I introduce you to one of the
bright lights of the English stage?

623
01:04:50,583 --> 01:04:53,166
Mrs. Kendal, Mr. John Merrick.

624
01:04:53,583 --> 01:04:54,824
Good day, Mr. Merrick.

625
01:04:57,125 --> 01:04:58,661
Good day!

626
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:01,333
I've brought you some things.
I hope you like them.

627
01:05:01,417 --> 01:05:03,249
I hope you don't think it too forward?

628
01:05:04,167 --> 01:05:07,160
Oh... oh, no.

629
01:05:08,208 --> 01:05:12,202
- I knew you'd understand.
- I'll leave you together.

630
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:16,366
Here.

631
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:22,699
I want you to know I don't go about
giving my picture to just anyone.

632
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:26,201
No, I wouldn't think of it.

633
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:30,573
It's beautiful. You're so...

634
01:05:33,417 --> 01:05:34,578
Well, I...

635
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:38,334
I'll... I shall put it in...

636
01:05:38,458 --> 01:05:40,745
in a place of honour.

637
01:05:42,167 --> 01:05:45,456
Here. Next to my mother.

638
01:05:51,208 --> 01:05:55,373
- She's very pretty, your mother.
- Oh, yes.

639
01:06:08,708 --> 01:06:12,247
Oh. I see you're constructing a...

640
01:06:12,333 --> 01:06:13,414
church?

641
01:06:15,875 --> 01:06:18,868
No. It's... it's a cathedral.

642
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:20,411
Do you see?

643
01:06:21,625 --> 01:06:27,121
Only... I have to rely on my imagination,

644
01:06:27,208 --> 01:06:31,248
for what I can't actually see, so...

645
01:06:41,542 --> 01:06:46,367
Mr. Treves tells me
that you're in the theatre.

646
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:51,541
- Do you live there?
- Oh no, Mr. Merrick, I just work there.

647
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:58,207
It must be wonderful
just to work there.

648
01:06:58,917 --> 01:07:01,751
- Is it beautiful?
- You've never been?

649
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:04,492
No, I'm afraid not.

650
01:07:05,042 --> 01:07:07,079
Oh, Mr. Merrick, you must go!

651
01:07:07,167 --> 01:07:09,250
The theatre's the most
beautiful place on earth.

652
01:07:09,417 --> 01:07:11,409
Of course, I am a bit partial.

653
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:15,083
The theatre is...

654
01:07:15,167 --> 01:07:16,167
romance.

655
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:19,661
Romance...

656
01:07:21,417 --> 01:07:22,828
Oh, yes...

657
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:27,621
Which reminds me,
I've brought you something else.

658
01:07:28,417 --> 01:07:30,079
Oh...

659
01:07:33,542 --> 01:07:36,740
- Thank you.
- Have you read it?

660
01:07:37,208 --> 01:07:42,624
No. Oh, but I certainly shall.

661
01:07:49,292 --> 01:07:52,865
Oh! "Romeo and Juliet".

662
01:07:53,292 --> 01:07:55,750
Yes, I've heard of this.

663
01:07:59,417 --> 01:08:04,242
"If I profane with my unworthiest hand

664
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:09,951
this holy shrine,
the gentle fine is this:

665
01:08:10,083 --> 01:08:15,454
Thy lips, two blushing pilgrims,

666
01:08:15,583 --> 01:08:20,533
ready stand, to smooth that
rough touch...

667
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:24,992
with a tender kiss."

668
01:08:25,875 --> 01:08:29,619
"Good Pilgrim,
you do wrong your hand too much,

669
01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:32,208
which mannerly devotion shows in this.

670
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:36,414
For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch.

671
01:08:36,583 --> 01:08:38,745
And palm to palm
is holy palmer's kiss."

672
01:08:40,625 --> 01:08:46,826
"Oh, then, dear saint,
let lips do what hands do.

673
01:08:46,958 --> 01:08:53,740
They pray, grant thou,
lest faith turn to despair."

674
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:59,495
"Saints do not move,
though grant for prayer's sake."

675
01:09:00,708 --> 01:09:07,708
"Then move not,
while my prayer's effect I take.

676
01:09:08,417 --> 01:09:14,084
Thus from my lips,
by thine, my sin is purged."

677
01:09:19,208 --> 01:09:21,291
And then it says: they kiss.

678
01:09:24,792 --> 01:09:28,206
"Then have my lips
the sin that they have took."

679
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:36,709
"Sin from my lips?

680
01:09:37,083 --> 01:09:40,872
O trespass, sweetly urg'd.

681
01:09:41,292 --> 01:09:44,956
Give me my sin again."

682
01:09:50,083 --> 01:09:52,166
Oh, Mr. Merrick.

683
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:54,412
You're not an Elephant Man at all.

684
01:09:57,208 --> 01:09:58,208
No?

685
01:09:58,708 --> 01:10:00,040
No.

686
01:10:00,792 --> 01:10:02,408
You're Romeo.

687
01:10:11,417 --> 01:10:14,080
"Mrs. Kendal, always at the
forefront of fashion and form,

688
01:10:14,208 --> 01:10:17,201
was seen leaving
"The London" the other afternoon.

689
01:10:17,333 --> 01:10:19,700
No, dear readers, the most
facile actress of our day

690
01:10:19,792 --> 01:10:21,374
has not been taken ill,

691
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:24,117
but rather said she was
visiting a friend.

692
01:10:24,208 --> 01:10:27,406
And who was the lucky recipient
of this attention?

693
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:29,495
Quick enquiries proved it to be
none other than

694
01:10:29,583 --> 01:10:31,916
Mr. John Merrick, the Elephant Man,

695
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,368
with whom our readers are
undoubtedly familiar.

696
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:37,742
After a chat of
three-quarters of an hour,

697
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:39,916
Mrs. Kendal was kind enough
to leave Mr. Merrick

698
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,037
with an autographed
portrait of herself."

699
01:10:42,167 --> 01:10:43,578
I saw it in his room.

700
01:10:44,417 --> 01:10:47,956
"Owing to a disfigurement
of the most extreme nature,

701
01:10:48,083 --> 01:10:52,248
Mr. Merrick has never been
properly presented to London society.

702
01:10:52,417 --> 01:10:54,329
But knowing that wherever
Mrs. Kendal goes,

703
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:57,201
others inevitably follow,

704
01:10:57,333 --> 01:11:01,828
the question arises - will London
society present itself to him?"

705
01:11:02,375 --> 01:11:06,415
This walking stick is so dashing!

706
01:11:06,542 --> 01:11:10,741
And much more elegant
than my old one!

707
01:11:12,083 --> 01:11:14,075
More tea?

708
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:24,416
You see, I don't go out
as often as I would like,

709
01:11:24,583 --> 01:11:30,250
because naturally some people
do find my appearance disturbing.

710
01:11:30,375 --> 01:11:33,083
If you have a chill,
I could close the window.

711
01:11:33,250 --> 01:11:36,618
Er... oh no, I'm fine.
Please, er...

712
01:11:36,708 --> 01:11:38,244
I mean, thank you.

713
01:11:39,458 --> 01:11:40,494
Thank you.

714
01:11:42,083 --> 01:11:43,494
You see,

715
01:11:45,042 --> 01:11:50,288
people are frightened
by what they don't understand.

716
01:11:51,083 --> 01:11:57,865
And it is hard to understand,
even for me, because my mother...

717
01:11:59,042 --> 01:12:01,625
she was so very beautiful.

718
01:12:11,583 --> 01:12:14,872
Mrs. Mothershead, I don't think
he should have any more visitors today.

719
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,059
And I have to lecture at the College,
so I'll be back this evening.

720
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:20,247
Excuse me, sir, but if you have time,
I would like a word with you.

721
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:21,824
I'm rather late. What is it?

722
01:12:22,125 --> 01:12:25,869
- Well, sir, I don't quite...
- I don't quite understand

723
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:29,118
why it is you allow
that sort of people in there.

724
01:12:29,208 --> 01:12:31,648
Why? Because he enjoys it,
and I think it's very good for him.

725
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:34,788
Yes, but, sir, you saw the
expression on their faces.

726
01:12:34,875 --> 01:12:36,741
They didn't hide their disgust.

727
01:12:36,833 --> 01:12:38,699
They don't care anything about John.

728
01:12:38,792 --> 01:12:41,205
They only want to
impress their friends.

729
01:12:41,333 --> 01:12:43,351
I think you're being rather
harsh on them, don't you?

730
01:12:43,375 --> 01:12:45,367
I beg your pardon, sir.

731
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,518
You yourself hardly showed him
much love and kindness

732
01:12:47,542 --> 01:12:49,374
when he first arrived, did you?

733
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:53,289
I bathed him, I fed him
and I cleaned up after him, didn't I?

734
01:12:53,417 --> 01:12:56,000
And I see that my nurses do the same.

735
01:12:56,333 --> 01:13:03,331
And if "loving kindness" can be called
care and practical concern

736
01:13:03,458 --> 01:13:06,781
then I did show him loving kindness,
and I am not ashamed to admit it!

737
01:13:06,917 --> 01:13:10,081
I didn't mean it exactly that way.
Now please believe me.

738
01:13:10,208 --> 01:13:11,995
Of course I appreciate your concern.

739
01:13:12,083 --> 01:13:13,684
I appreciate everything that
you've done for Mr. Merrick.

740
01:13:13,708 --> 01:13:14,666
Thank you.

741
01:13:14,667 --> 01:13:18,661
But I am the physician in charge
and I must do what I think is best for him.

742
01:13:19,125 --> 01:13:22,698
- Please now, I'm also very late.
- If you ask my opinion,

743
01:13:22,833 --> 01:13:26,156
he's only being stared at
all over again!

744
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:27,616
Thank you.

745
01:13:54,292 --> 01:13:56,158
Night time!

746
01:16:43,583 --> 01:16:44,869
Freddie.

747
01:16:46,917 --> 01:16:49,000
What's the matter, Freddie?

748
01:16:53,083 --> 01:16:56,576
- I've been thinking about Mr. Bytes.
- What on earth made you think of him?

749
01:16:57,167 --> 01:17:00,535
Well, I'm beginning to believe that
Mr. Bytes and I are very much alike.

750
01:17:01,875 --> 01:17:03,161
That's absurd.

751
01:17:06,167 --> 01:17:07,248
It seems that I...

752
01:17:07,333 --> 01:17:12,328
I've made Mr. Merrick into a
curiosity all over again, doesn't it?

753
01:17:13,417 --> 01:17:16,706
Only this time in a hospital
rather than a carnival.

754
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:23,494
My name is constantly in the papers.
I'm always being praised to the skies.

755
01:17:23,625 --> 01:17:27,665
Patients are now
expressly asking for my services.

756
01:17:28,083 --> 01:17:30,496
Of course they do.
Because you are a very fine doctor.

757
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,083
John Merrick is happier
and more fulfilled now

758
01:17:33,167 --> 01:17:35,284
than he's ever been in his entire life,

759
01:17:35,417 --> 01:17:38,034
and it's completely due to you.

760
01:17:39,417 --> 01:17:41,158
What was it all for?

761
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:43,082
Why did I do it?

762
01:17:43,792 --> 01:17:46,079
Freddie, what are you trying to say?

763
01:17:50,167 --> 01:17:52,409
Am I a good man,

764
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:55,333
or am I a bad man?

765
01:18:01,167 --> 01:18:04,331
Steady on, Treves.
Steady on, my dear fellow.

766
01:18:04,667 --> 01:18:06,875
Come and sit down, won't you?

767
01:18:12,042 --> 01:18:13,328
Gentlemen,

768
01:18:13,417 --> 01:18:17,331
I know we usually open these
proceedings by reading the minutes.

769
01:18:17,625 --> 01:18:19,958
But on this occasion,
in the interests of urgency,

770
01:18:20,042 --> 01:18:24,207
I think we should first conclude
the matter previously under discussion,

771
01:18:24,375 --> 01:18:26,958
the case of Mr. John Merrick,
the Elephant Man.

772
01:18:27,208 --> 01:18:29,416
One moment, Mr. Chairman!

773
01:18:30,208 --> 01:18:34,498
As far as I'm concerned, this creature
has no business being here at all.

774
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:40,745
I for one am sick and tired
of this competitive freak-hunting

775
01:18:40,875 --> 01:18:43,288
by these overly ambitious
young doctors

776
01:18:43,375 --> 01:18:45,412
trying to make names for themselves.

777
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:47,958
To parade them about in front of
a pathological society

778
01:18:48,042 --> 01:18:49,533
is one thing, Mr. Treves,

779
01:18:49,792 --> 01:18:51,784
but to waste this committee's
valuable time

780
01:18:51,875 --> 01:18:53,912
with requests for shelter for these...

781
01:18:54,083 --> 01:18:57,326
abominations of nature
is quite another.

782
01:19:01,042 --> 01:19:04,001
You must be more careful...

783
01:19:04,667 --> 01:19:07,375
In the light of these facts,
our course is clear.

784
01:19:08,208 --> 01:19:11,576
The question is not whether to
accept this creature as a patient,

785
01:19:11,708 --> 01:19:16,157
the question is: when will those rooms
be vacated for use by better qualified,

786
01:19:16,333 --> 01:19:18,290
- more deserving cases?
- Hear, hear.

787
01:19:18,917 --> 01:19:20,078
I move that this Elephant Man

788
01:19:20,167 --> 01:19:22,659
be removed from the premises
immediately.

789
01:19:23,375 --> 01:19:26,368
We have a sacred duty
to cure the sick,

790
01:19:26,458 --> 01:19:28,074
not care for circus animals!

791
01:19:28,292 --> 01:19:31,490
- Mr. Broadneck...
- That is my last word on the subject.

792
01:19:31,625 --> 01:19:32,745
Mr. Chairman, shall we vote?

793
01:19:32,833 --> 01:19:36,782
I take it, Mr. Broadneck, that your mind
is quite unshakeable in this matter?

794
01:19:36,875 --> 01:19:39,743
Mr. Chairman, do you not have ears?

795
01:19:39,917 --> 01:19:42,330
I am unalterably opposed!

796
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:45,082
My mind is made up on this.

797
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,957
You shall not sway me.

798
01:19:49,042 --> 01:19:50,499
May we now vote, Mr. Chairman,

799
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,616
at long last?

800
01:19:54,125 --> 01:19:55,457
Yes, Broadneck.

801
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:57,665
I think the time has come.

802
01:19:58,667 --> 01:20:01,831
Gentlemen, Her Royal Highness

803
01:20:02,417 --> 01:20:05,080
Alexandra, Princess of Wales.

804
01:20:23,042 --> 01:20:25,910
Good morning, gentlemen.
I hope I am not disturbing you.

805
01:20:26,042 --> 01:20:27,203
On the contrary, ma'am,

806
01:20:27,292 --> 01:20:30,251
your presence here
is always greatly appreciated.

807
01:20:30,750 --> 01:20:34,073
We were just taking a vote
on Mr. Merrick.

808
01:20:37,917 --> 01:20:41,661
Her Royal Highness has shown the
greatest interest in Mr. Merrick's fate.

809
01:20:41,792 --> 01:20:44,864
Indeed I have, sir, as has the Queen.

810
01:20:47,625 --> 01:20:50,208
I have a brief communication
from Her Majesty,

811
01:20:50,292 --> 01:20:53,080
which she has requested
that I read to you.

812
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:58,743
"To the Governing Committee,
London Hospital.

813
01:21:06,667 --> 01:21:09,535
I would very much like
to commend you

814
01:21:09,667 --> 01:21:13,707
for the charitable face you have shown
Mr. John Merrick, the Elephant Man.

815
01:21:14,083 --> 01:21:17,121
It is laudable that you have
provided one of England's

816
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:23,531
most unfortunate sons with a safe
and tranquil harbour, a home.

817
01:21:24,083 --> 01:21:27,906
For this immeasurable kindness,
as well as the many other acts of mercy

818
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:31,406
on behalf of the poor,
of which Mr. Carr Gomm

819
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,083
has kept me informed,

820
01:21:34,583 --> 01:21:38,748
I gratefully thank you.
Signed, Victoria."

821
01:21:43,917 --> 01:21:48,241
I am sure I can count on you
gentlemen to do the Christian thing.

822
01:21:48,375 --> 01:21:52,540
Thank you very much, ma'am.
I'm sure we shall all try.

823
01:21:53,292 --> 01:21:55,579
Gentlemen, I wish to move
that Mr. John Merrick

824
01:21:55,667 --> 01:21:58,375
be admitted to this hospital
on a permanent basis

825
01:21:58,958 --> 01:22:01,450
provided the hospital
receives a yearly sum

826
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:04,410
equal to the cost of
the occupation of one bed.

827
01:22:05,167 --> 01:22:07,375
All those in favour?

828
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:22,031
Thank you, gentlemen. The motion is carried.

829
01:22:27,958 --> 01:22:29,950
Yes, come in!

830
01:22:36,167 --> 01:22:38,250
Good afternoon.

831
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:41,997
Mr. Carr Gomm has something
he wants to say to you.

832
01:22:42,125 --> 01:22:44,583
Mr. Merrick,
I have very great pleasure

833
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:49,199
in being able to welcome you
officially to the London Hospital.

834
01:22:49,333 --> 01:22:52,531
This morning, the Governing Committee
unanimously voted that you should be

835
01:22:52,625 --> 01:22:56,198
provided with these rooms
on a permanent basis.

836
01:22:56,292 --> 01:22:58,500
This is your home now.

837
01:22:58,625 --> 01:23:03,245
- I'm so very, very glad for you.
- Welcome home, lad!

838
01:23:07,375 --> 01:23:09,833
This is...

839
01:23:10,917 --> 01:23:12,499
my home?

840
01:23:12,583 --> 01:23:13,664
Yes.

841
01:23:14,375 --> 01:23:18,619
Please, will you thank
the Governing Committee for me?

842
01:23:18,708 --> 01:23:23,749
I will do my utmost
to merit their kindness.

843
01:23:24,417 --> 01:23:28,741
This... is my home?

844
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:32,709
Yes. And this is one other thing.

845
01:23:39,083 --> 01:23:40,415
Your dressing case.

846
01:23:40,542 --> 01:23:43,706
Oh... oh...

847
01:23:44,625 --> 01:23:48,369
Oh... this is...

848
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:52,163
Oh, thank you!

849
01:23:52,958 --> 01:23:55,575
Oh, thank you!

850
01:23:55,667 --> 01:24:00,287
Oh! Oh, thank you!
Oh, my friends, thank you!

851
01:24:00,375 --> 01:24:03,368
Oh!

852
01:24:03,458 --> 01:24:05,324
My friends!

853
01:24:10,625 --> 01:24:12,742
Oh, my friends!

854
01:24:13,417 --> 01:24:15,249
My friends!

855
01:24:16,208 --> 01:24:18,074
Oh, thank you!

856
01:24:35,708 --> 01:24:38,246
Okay, mate.

857
01:24:39,542 --> 01:24:42,159
And you, darling, behave yourself.

858
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:45,163
- Who's next?
- I... I say!

859
01:24:46,417 --> 01:24:48,625
- What, you again?
- Well...

860
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:51,955
These young ladies have never seen it.

861
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:58,994
You're on, mate!

862
01:25:00,250 --> 01:25:02,708
OK, that's it for this performance!

863
01:25:03,125 --> 01:25:06,493
- Jim, can I go tonight?
- Sit down, Charlie!

864
01:25:08,292 --> 01:25:11,000
There's always tomorrow, don't worry.

865
01:25:13,542 --> 01:25:15,784
Room for one more?

866
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,287
At the right price.

867
01:25:20,333 --> 01:25:21,414
There's room.

868
01:25:33,417 --> 01:25:36,251
All right, all right,
keep the noise down!

869
01:25:38,375 --> 01:25:42,119
We don't wanna frighten him, do we?

870
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:21,372
My name is John Merrick.

871
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:27,325
I'm very, very pleased to meet you.

872
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:34,457
I think you are...

873
01:26:35,417 --> 01:26:38,581
very... beautiful!

874
01:26:42,083 --> 01:26:44,496
Curtain time!

875
01:26:44,625 --> 01:26:48,699
You look beautiful, darling!
I wouldn't change a thing!

876
01:26:49,583 --> 01:26:52,417
You look like the bleedin'
Prince of Wales!

877
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:56,166
Here, my friends!

878
01:26:57,417 --> 01:26:58,908
The Elephant Man!

879
01:27:02,333 --> 01:27:05,076
I told you it was 'orrible!

880
01:27:05,167 --> 01:27:07,250
Just horrible.

881
01:27:16,625 --> 01:27:19,083
Perhaps the ladies
would like a closer look?

882
01:27:19,625 --> 01:27:23,323
- Yeah, yeah!
- No, Jack, please!

883
01:27:23,833 --> 01:27:26,416
Here's what you've been waiting for.

884
01:27:26,875 --> 01:27:28,082
There!

885
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:34,199
Ooh!
He's quite a ladies' man, isn't he?

886
01:27:34,292 --> 01:27:39,037
Come on.
Give the ladies' man a little kiss, eh?

887
01:27:39,833 --> 01:27:41,916
Come on, give him a kiss!

888
01:27:42,083 --> 01:27:44,826
Oh, Jack, leave off!

889
01:27:54,417 --> 01:27:58,491
Here, here, that's enough romance!
Time for beddy-byes!

890
01:28:49,042 --> 01:28:51,910
All right, keep the noise down!
Now keep it quiet.

891
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,619
Quiet! Hey! Now watch this!

892
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:43,197
Okay, that's enough!

893
01:29:43,958 --> 01:29:47,247
Show's over!
See you back at the Peacock!

894
01:29:49,875 --> 01:29:51,286
Get out of it!

895
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:22,369
Here, come on.

896
01:30:26,083 --> 01:30:29,201
There you are. That's better, innit?

897
01:30:31,667 --> 01:30:33,784
I've done well tonight.

898
01:30:34,417 --> 01:30:37,706
Here, buy yourself a sweet.

899
01:31:05,125 --> 01:31:07,162
My treasure!

900
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,411
John?

901
01:32:15,792 --> 01:32:16,908
John!

902
01:32:23,542 --> 01:32:27,240
Mr. Treves,
I know what happened last night.

903
01:32:37,042 --> 01:32:38,533
Dear God!

904
01:32:39,875 --> 01:32:40,875
Boy!

905
01:32:58,083 --> 01:32:59,699
Where is he?

906
01:32:59,958 --> 01:33:01,745
Where is Mr. Merrick?

907
01:33:02,083 --> 01:33:04,120
Hmm? John?

908
01:33:07,625 --> 01:33:10,333
Where is he?
Where's Mr. Merrick?

909
01:33:12,542 --> 01:33:15,330
- I don't know what you mean, sir.
- Don't lie to me!

910
01:33:17,042 --> 01:33:19,910
I know all about it.
You were seen.

911
01:33:20,083 --> 01:33:23,121
You're involved with Bytes, aren't you?
You've taken him.

912
01:33:23,208 --> 01:33:24,870
Where... is... he?

913
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,540
Now, wait a minute! I haven't
taken him anywhere. I dunno no Bytes.

914
01:33:29,958 --> 01:33:33,656
We were just having a bit of fun.
We never hurt 'im.

915
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:35,912
You know, just having a laugh.
That's all.

916
01:33:36,042 --> 01:33:38,830
You bastard, he's gone!

917
01:33:38,958 --> 01:33:41,245
When I left him, he was
in bed, safe and sound!

918
01:33:41,708 --> 01:33:44,542
You bastard!

919
01:33:44,667 --> 01:33:48,331
You're not listening to me!
I told you, I dunno no Bytes!

920
01:33:48,833 --> 01:33:50,199
I ain't done nothing wrong!

921
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:53,952
People pay money to see your monster,
Mr. Treves. I collect it.

922
01:33:54,292 --> 01:33:56,079
You're the monster, you're the freak!

923
01:33:56,208 --> 01:33:57,915
Now get out, you're finished!
Damn you!

924
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,914
You don't frighten me!
You and your bleedin' Elephant Man!

925
01:34:03,667 --> 01:34:06,626
I'm glad what I done.
And you can do nothing about it!

926
01:34:06,750 --> 01:34:08,912
Only Mothershead can sack me now!

927
01:34:14,792 --> 01:34:16,374
Done!

928
01:34:32,833 --> 01:34:35,473
There's something
I'd like to tell you, Treves.

929
01:34:36,292 --> 01:34:39,911
You know, I felt
as deeply as you did about John.

930
01:34:40,042 --> 01:34:44,207
Well now he's disappeared,
very likely to the continent.

931
01:34:44,333 --> 01:34:46,450
There's no question of your
going after him.

932
01:34:46,542 --> 01:34:49,455
You're desperately needed here
by your patients.

933
01:34:49,583 --> 01:34:52,166
You did everything in your power.

934
01:34:52,417 --> 01:34:57,037
Remember that, Treves.
Everything in your power.

935
01:35:41,875 --> 01:35:43,867
Le terrible...

936
01:35:45,833 --> 01:35:47,995
Homme Éléphant!

937
01:36:26,083 --> 01:36:27,915
Get the stool!

938
01:36:54,667 --> 01:36:55,908
Get up, you bastard!

939
01:37:21,583 --> 01:37:25,748
Look at all these beautiful animals!

940
01:37:29,958 --> 01:37:32,575
What a lot you have!

941
01:37:44,292 --> 01:37:46,625
That sly bastard!

942
01:37:51,958 --> 01:37:55,201
He's doing this to spite me!

943
01:38:05,167 --> 01:38:09,537
You're doing this to spite me
and it's got to stop!

944
01:38:09,667 --> 01:38:13,911
- Bytes, he's sick!
- Let him die!

945
01:38:16,250 --> 01:38:18,867
But don't think
I'm going to bury that...

946
01:38:21,458 --> 01:38:24,166
bag of flesh. No!

947
01:38:31,750 --> 01:38:34,083
As a matter of fact...

948
01:38:40,417 --> 01:38:42,909
- Bytes, stop!
- As a matter of fact!

949
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,413
Bytes, no, please!

950
01:39:00,417 --> 01:39:01,749
No!

951
01:39:30,917 --> 01:39:32,829
Bytes, please, just don't...

952
01:40:33,792 --> 01:40:37,536
Don't make too much noise.

953
01:40:39,917 --> 01:40:42,250
We've decided...

954
01:40:45,375 --> 01:40:48,743
we're going to get you out of here.
All right?

955
01:41:15,375 --> 01:41:17,708
Good on you, mate.
Good on you.

956
01:42:36,958 --> 01:42:39,325
Luck, my friend!

957
01:42:41,250 --> 01:42:44,948
Luck! And who needs it more than we?

958
01:44:12,250 --> 01:44:14,492
Hey, mister!

959
01:44:15,250 --> 01:44:18,243
Mister, why is your head so big?

960
01:44:20,250 --> 01:44:21,582
Mister!

961
01:44:22,542 --> 01:44:24,374
Why is your head so big, mister?

962
01:44:27,458 --> 01:44:30,747
Why is your head so big? Tell me!
Why won't you answer me, mister?

963
01:44:34,208 --> 01:44:36,916
Er, mister?

964
01:44:37,083 --> 01:44:39,575
Why is your head so big, mister?

965
01:44:41,542 --> 01:44:42,749
Mister!

966
01:45:08,500 --> 01:45:10,958
Stop him, stop him!

967
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,913
No!

968
01:46:06,583 --> 01:46:09,621
I am not an elephant!

969
01:46:11,250 --> 01:46:15,119
I am not an animal!

970
01:46:16,875 --> 01:46:21,245
I am a human being!

971
01:46:25,917 --> 01:46:27,704
I...

972
01:46:28,875 --> 01:46:30,411
am a man.

973
01:46:37,917 --> 01:46:40,500
Out of the way, sir. Excuse me.

974
01:46:43,583 --> 01:46:46,655
Mr. Treves, sir! They've found him!

975
01:46:47,083 --> 01:46:49,166
I think they've found John!

976
01:47:09,667 --> 01:47:11,533
- Keep still, girl!
- Sorry.

977
01:47:13,917 --> 01:47:16,705
It was very nice of Mrs. Kendal
to give me this dress for tonight.

978
01:47:17,417 --> 01:47:19,124
It's so beautiful!

979
01:47:22,583 --> 01:47:25,246
Does Mrs. Kendal know
that John is dying?

980
01:47:26,917 --> 01:47:28,124
Yes.

981
01:47:29,792 --> 01:47:31,124
Yes, she knows.

982
01:47:46,042 --> 01:47:47,203
How do I look?

983
01:47:48,750 --> 01:47:50,207
Splendid!

984
01:47:50,583 --> 01:47:54,452
You will not look out of place.
You look absolutely splendid.

985
01:47:54,917 --> 01:47:58,866
- Splendid... shall we go?
- Yes.

986
01:47:59,792 --> 01:48:05,083
Again, I can't tell you how sorry I am
for what happened.

987
01:48:05,458 --> 01:48:08,576
You see, I had no idea. Really.

988
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,538
Please, you mustn't blame yourself.

989
01:48:12,125 --> 01:48:15,664
Mr. Treves, don't worry about me.

990
01:48:16,458 --> 01:48:18,120
My friend,

991
01:48:18,583 --> 01:48:22,372
I am happy every hour of the day.

992
01:48:24,333 --> 01:48:28,748
My life is full,
because I know that I am loved.

993
01:48:32,667 --> 01:48:35,535
I have gained myself.

994
01:48:43,417 --> 01:48:49,209
I could not say that,
were it not for you.

995
01:48:53,750 --> 01:48:54,750
Well...

996
01:48:55,792 --> 01:49:00,492
And I...
You've done so much for me as well.

997
01:49:01,167 --> 01:49:02,453
Thank you.

998
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,866
So! Um...

999
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:12,290
I'll fetch Mrs. Mothershead and Nora,
and be back in a few minutes.

1000
01:49:14,708 --> 01:49:16,791
Very good, my friend.

1001
01:49:21,375 --> 01:49:23,162
My friend...

1002
01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:21,241
Mrs. Kendal!

1003
01:52:26,375 --> 01:52:30,073
Your Royal Highness,
ladies and gentlemen.

1004
01:52:30,250 --> 01:52:32,788
Tonight's performance
was very special to me,

1005
01:52:32,875 --> 01:52:35,242
because it was very special
to someone else.

1006
01:52:35,417 --> 01:52:38,410
A man who knows the theatre,
and who loves the theatre.

1007
01:52:38,833 --> 01:52:41,496
And yet this is the very first time
he's ever been here.

1008
01:52:42,750 --> 01:52:44,366
I wish to dedicate,

1009
01:52:44,458 --> 01:52:47,326
the whole company wishes
to dedicate with all their hearts,

1010
01:52:47,833 --> 01:52:51,782
tonight's performance,
to Mr. John Merrick,

1011
01:52:51,917 --> 01:52:54,034
my very dear friend.

1012
01:53:06,333 --> 01:53:07,869
Stand up for us.

1013
01:53:08,292 --> 01:53:10,750
- I can't.
- Go on, it's all right.

1014
01:53:10,833 --> 01:53:13,246
Just stand up.
They want to see you.

1015
01:53:50,417 --> 01:53:54,536
I really did believe that...

1016
01:53:54,667 --> 01:53:58,331
the ogre would never
get out of the dungeon.

1017
01:53:58,542 --> 01:54:01,501
Good.

1018
01:54:01,583 --> 01:54:03,495
So you really enjoyed yourself?

1019
01:54:03,625 --> 01:54:07,915
Oh, it was wonderful!

1020
01:54:09,667 --> 01:54:12,580
Then we must go again some evening.

1021
01:54:12,750 --> 01:54:16,198
Oh, yes. Oh, I hope so!

1022
01:54:16,333 --> 01:54:18,165
Yes, we will, we will.

1023
01:54:19,583 --> 01:54:21,324
Good, I'm pleased.

1024
01:54:22,042 --> 01:54:27,037
Well, um... I ought to go.
Must get some sleep.

1025
01:54:27,708 --> 01:54:30,371
Good night, and sleep well.

1026
01:54:32,250 --> 01:54:34,742
And you too, my friend.

1027
01:54:36,333 --> 01:54:39,326
So pleased you enjoyed yourself.
Good night.

1028
01:54:44,292 --> 01:54:45,533
Good night.

1029
01:56:14,833 --> 01:56:17,120
It's...

1030
01:56:18,333 --> 01:56:20,746
finished!

1031
01:59:51,167 --> 01:59:54,740
Never, oh never. Nothing will die.

1032
01:59:55,583 --> 01:59:58,997
The stream flows, the wind blows,

1033
01:59:59,875 --> 02:00:03,915
the cloud fleets, the heart beats.

1034
02:00:25,083 --> 02:00:27,450
Nothing will die.
