Why did the children
break into Old Misery's house?

- Joanie?
- They wanted to rob him.

00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:38,274
If you had actually read the short story,
which was a whopping 13 pages,

193

deal of money in the mattress, but burn it.

They say it when they flood the house,
when they tear it to shreds,

197
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:06,594
that destruction is a form of creation,
so burning the money is ironic.

198
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:10,014
They just want to see what happens
when they tear the world apart.

199

322
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:42,623

- No, I mean, like, "go" with me.

323

- You know, like "going together".
- Sure.

324

- I think about girls a lot.

339
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:14,715
I asked you about school, Donnie.

340
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:18,510
I think about fucking a lot during school.

- "Married With Children".

00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:29,021
- You think about your family?
- I just turn down the volume

343
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:31,773
and think about fucking
Christina Applegate.

344
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:34,776
I asked you about your family.

345
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:36,445
No.

346
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:41,158
I don't think about fucking my family.
That's gross.

347
00:36:41,617 --> 00:36:44,536
I'd like to hear about your friend Frank.

348
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:03,639
(Principal) Sam Bylan.

349
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:16,360
Cherita Chen.

350
00:37:34,127 --> 00:37:35,587
Donald Darko.

351
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:00,570
Daye Dennis.

352
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:08,662
Hey, you fuck!

353
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:11,915
Did you say I flooded the school?

354
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:18,005
- I didn't say shit.
- Yeah, well, they think I did it.

355
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:22,301
If you're innocent, then you have
nothing to worry about, right?

356
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:24,761
Fuck you! You know what I think?

357
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,932
I think you did it.

358
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:47,326
Beer and pussy - that's all I need.

359
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:50,495
- We gotta find ourselves a Smurfette.
- Smurfette?

360
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:54,833
Mm-hm.
Not some tight-ass Middlesex chick.

361
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,505
Like, this cute little blonde that'll
get down with the guys like Smurfette does.

362
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:03,091
Smurfette doesn't fuck.

363
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:08,889
That's bullshit.
Why do you think Papa Smurf made her?

364
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:12,059
Because the other Smurfs
were getting too horny.

365
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:19,149
- Not Vanity. I heard he was a homosexual.
- Then she fucks them while Vanity watches.

366
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:22,527
What about Papa Smurf?
He must get some action?

367
00:39:22,652 --> 00:39:28,158
What he does, he films the gang-bang.
Later on, he beats off to the tape.

368
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:34,122
First of all, Papa Smurf
didn't create Smurfette. Gargamel did.

369
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:38,627
She was sent as Gargamel's evil spy
to destroy the Smurf village,

370
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:43,006
but the overwhelming goodness
of the Smurfs transformed her.

371
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:48,804
And as for the whole gang-bang scenario,
it just couldn't happen!

372
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:55,852
Smurfs are asexual. They don't even have
reproductive organs under those little pants.

373
00:39:57,145 --> 00:40:01,149
That's what's so illogical
about being a Smurf.

374
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:05,487
What's the point of living
if you don't have a dick?

375
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:13,203
Donnie, why you gotta get smart on us?

376
00:40:13,328 --> 00:40:15,497
- (Horn honks)
- Grandma Death.

377
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:19,960
(Miss Farmer) Excuse me! Excuse me!

378
00:40:20,127 --> 00:40:24,965
Please stay off the road, Miss Sparrow,
or I will call Social Services.

379
00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:28,677
I hate that Miss Farmer.
She's such a fucking bitch!

380
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:30,887
Yeah.

381
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:34,599
- How old is Grandma Death?
- (Donnie) 101.

382
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:38,562
She does the same thing every day.

383
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:44,693
Just walks back and forth
and back and forth to the mailbox.

384
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:48,363
Nothing ever in there.

385
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,910
Oh, wait, wait, wait...

386
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:58,874
She's going back to the box.
We may still have mail.

387
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:01,501
- Mail, mail, mail.
- Here it is.

388
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:04,921
This could be it. Oh...?

389
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:09,551
- Oh, no dice, Grandma. Sorry.
- Someone ought to write that bitch.

390
00:41:09,676 --> 00:41:11,928
(TV) 'Authorities continued their search

391
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:15,515
'for a suspect
in the Middlesex Ridge School vandalism.

392
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:20,103
'The private school has asked for
donations to restore its beloved mascot,

393
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,647
'known only as the Mongrel...'

394
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:34,534
It's very helpful.
There's a good turnout tonight.

395
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:38,747
What are you trying to accomplish here?

396
00:41:38,914 --> 00:41:42,584
There was urine and faeces
flooded in my office.

397
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:46,004
Whatever fits.

398
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:50,091
"Whatever fits"?

399
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,844
In cooperation with the county police,

400
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:57,349
we have begun an active investigation
into the cause of the flooding.

401
00:41:57,474 --> 00:42:01,269
And our suspects
include several of our own students...

402
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:06,441
I want to know why this filth
is being taught to our children.

403
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:19,246
Kitty, I would appreciate
if you would wait...

404
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:26,378
Dr Cole, not only am I a teacher, but I
am also a parent of a Middlesex child.

405
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:32,133
Therefore I am the only person here
who transcends the parent-teacher bridge.

406
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:40,475
(Frank) 'Don't worry.
You got away with it.'

407
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,062
I have in my hand Graham Greene's
"The Destructors".

408
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:49,317
This short story is part
of my daughter's English assignment.

409
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:55,532
In this story, several children destroy
an elderly man's house from inside out.

410
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:01,705
(Eerie humming)

411
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,631
How can you do that?

412
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:25,061
And how do they do this? They flood the
house by breaking through a water main.

413
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:29,983
'I can do anything I want.

414
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,611
'And so can you.'

415
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:34,904
(Applause)

416
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:39,367
And I think
that this garbage should be removed!

417
00:43:39,576 --> 00:43:44,247
Excuse me. What is the real issue here?
The PTA doesn't ban books.

418
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:50,587
The PTA must acknowledge that pornography
is being taught in our curriculum!

419
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:56,343
- It's meant to be ironic.
- Excuse me. Go back to grad school.

420
00:43:56,468 --> 00:44:00,597
Why did you make me flood the school?

421
00:44:04,017 --> 00:44:06,186
They are in great danger.

422
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:09,606
Do you even know who Graham Greene is?

423
00:44:10,649 --> 00:44:13,735
I think we have all seen "Bonanza".

424
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:20,283
Well, um... while we are on other topics...

425
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:22,911
Where do you come from?

426
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:27,374
'Do you believe in time travel?'

427
00:44:29,459 --> 00:44:31,753
(Sam) Who are you talking to?

428
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,510
I was just taking my pills, Sam.

429
00:44:49,229 --> 00:44:52,190
A storm is coming, Frank says.

430
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:55,443
A storm that will swallow the children,

431
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:00,156
And I will deliver them
from the kingdom of pain.

432
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:06,579
I'll deliver them back to their doorsteps,
send the monsters back to the underground.

433
00:45:06,746 --> 00:45:10,875
I'll send them back to a place
where no one else can see them.

434
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:13,336
Except for me.

435
00:45:14,421 --> 00:45:17,340
Because I am Donnie Darko.

436
00:45:25,682 --> 00:45:27,142
Who is Frank?

437
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:37,485
- A six-foot-tall bunny rabbit.
- (Giggling)

438
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:48,747
'In these modern times, our attitude
and beliefs are so delicate, so fragile.'

439
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:54,252
'I have had a Cunning Vision.
This vision has released me.'

440
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:59,716
'It's important that our lifeline be
rejuvenated, so that we can breathe again.

441
00:45:59,883 --> 00:46:01,968
'It's time to breathe.'

442
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:05,221
'It is time to breathe.'

443
00:46:05,764 --> 00:46:07,891
'Thank you, Jim Cunningham.'

444
00:46:09,017 --> 00:46:11,519
'Thank you, Jim Cunningham.'

445
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:17,901
'So now let us begin Lifeline Exercise
Number One. Please press stop now.'

446
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:30,830
As you can see, the lifeline
is divided into two polar extremes.

447
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:33,041
Fear and love.

448
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:37,712
Fear is in the negative energy spectrum.

449
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:42,091
- Love is in the positive energy spectrum.
- No, duh.

450
00:46:42,342 --> 00:46:47,096
Excuse me?
"No, duh" is a product of fear.

451
00:46:48,515 --> 00:46:55,313
Now, on each card is a character dilemma
which applies to the lifeline.

452
00:46:58,441 --> 00:47:01,945
Please... Take this. Thank you.

453
00:47:02,612 --> 00:47:05,490
Please read each character dilemma aloud

454
00:47:05,615 --> 00:47:09,911
and place an X on the lifeline
in the appropriate place.

455
00:47:10,787 --> 00:47:12,664
Cherita?

456
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,591
"Juanita has an important math test today."

457
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:28,429
"She's known about the test
for several weeks, but has not studied."

458
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:35,436
"In order to keep from failing,
Juanita decides to cheat on the math test."

459
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:41,025
Good. Good. Very good.

460
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:43,069
Mr Darko.

461
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:53,830
"Ling Ling finds a wallet
filled with money."

462
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:58,710
"She takes it to the address on the
driver's license but keeps the money."

463
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:02,672
I'm sorry, Miss Farmer. I don't get this.

464
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:05,800
Just place an "X" in the appropriate place.

465
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:12,348
I know what to do, but you can't
lump things into two categories.

466
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:16,144
The lifeline is divided that way.

467
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:18,980
Well, life isn't that simple. I mean...

468
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:24,611
Who cares if Ling Ling keeps the money?
It has nothing to do with fear or love.

469
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:30,700
- They are the deepest human emotions.
- OK. But you're not listening to me.

470
00:48:30,867 --> 00:48:35,955
There are other things to take into account,
the whole spectrum of human emotion.

471
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:40,627
You can't just lump everything into two
categories and deny everything else!

472
00:48:40,752 --> 00:48:45,006
If you don't complete the assignment,
you'll get a zero.

473
00:48:49,928 --> 00:48:53,389
Donald, let me preface this by saying

474
00:48:53,514 --> 00:48:59,270
that your Iowa Test scores are...
intimidating.

475
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:03,066
So...

476
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:08,529
Let's go over this again.
What exactly did you say to Miss Farmer?

477
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:16,871
I'll tell you. He asked me to forcibly insert
the lifeline exercise card into my anus!

478
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:19,707
(Stifles laughter with cough)

479
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:38,935
Nobody cares about responsibility,
morality, family values...

480
00:49:42,689 --> 00:49:46,234
Kitty... Excuse us, please.

481
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:54,367
They've suspended him from after-school
activities for six months.

482
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,958
Since this jet engine fiasco,
I don't know what's gotten into...

483
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:08,464
I'll say this because our daughters are on
the dance team together and I respect you,

484
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:14,095
but after witnessing your son's behaviour,
I have significant doubts about your...

485
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:21,936
Our paths through life must be righteous.
Go home and look in the mirror

486
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:26,983
and pray that your son doesn't succumb
to the path of fear.

487
00:50:31,154 --> 00:50:37,452
Do you remember
that weird gym teacher, Mrs Farmer?

488
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:42,874
Yeah. OK, well, my brother told her
to shove a book up her ass today.

489
00:50:42,999 --> 00:50:47,045
And then my parents
just bought him all this new shit.

490
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:52,008
Yeah, I know.
I wish a jet engine would fall on my room.

491
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,319
- Dr Monnitoff.
- Donnie.

492
00:51:11,611 --> 00:51:12,945
Um...

493
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:16,157
I know this is gonna
sound kind of weird, but, uh,

494
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,827
do you know anything about...
time travel?

495
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:28,377
(Monnitoff) A wormhole
with an Einstein-Rosen bridge,

496
00:51:28,628 --> 00:51:33,174
which is theoretically
a wormhole in space controlled by man.

497
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:41,349
So, according to Hawking, a wormhole
may be able to provide a short cut

498
00:51:41,516 --> 00:51:44,435
for jumping
between two distant regions of space-time.

499
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:49,857
So to travel back in time, you have to have
a spaceship faster than the speed of light.

500
00:51:50,066 --> 00:51:53,152
- Theoretically.
- And be able to find a wormhole.

501
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:56,030
The basic principles of
time travel are there.

502
00:51:56,197 --> 00:52:00,034
Your vessel and portal.
Your vessel can be anything.

503
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:03,371
- Like a DeLorean?
- Metal craft of any kind.

504
00:52:03,538 --> 00:52:09,502
You know, I love that movie.
It's so... like, futuristic, you know?

505
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:14,966
Listen, um...
don't tell anybody that I gave you this.

506
00:52:15,091 --> 00:52:20,638
Woman who wrote this used to teach here.
She was a nun long before that.

507
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:25,685
Then overnight
she became this entirely different person.

508
00:52:25,852 --> 00:52:29,313
She up and left the church,
wrote this book...

509
00:52:30,273 --> 00:52:33,818
She started teaching science,
right here at Middlesex.

510
00:52:34,944 --> 00:52:37,196
"The Philosophy Of Time Travel".

511
00:52:38,948 --> 00:52:41,033
Roberta Sparrow?

512
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:43,119
That's right.

513
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:48,416
Roberta Sparrow?

514
00:53:07,977 --> 00:53:10,104
Roberta Sparrow.

515
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:13,649
Grandma Death.

516
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:36,172
It's called "The Philosophy
Of Time Travel".

517
00:53:36,297 --> 00:53:40,927
- What does philosophy have to do with it?
- Guess who wrote it.

518
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:42,511
Who?

519
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:46,849
Roberta Sparrow. Huh! She wrote a book.

520
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:51,938
- Grandma Death wrote a book.
- That's a terrible nickname.

521
00:53:52,939 --> 00:53:56,275
We almost ran her down the other day.

522
00:53:56,442 --> 00:54:01,489
She lives in that piece of crap house,
and you know she's loaded.

523
00:54:01,656 --> 00:54:06,452
- You're right.
- She was known for her gem collection.

524
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:12,416
Kids used to go up there all the time
and try to steal stuff from her.

525
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:14,710
She became a total recluse.

526
00:54:16,003 --> 00:54:21,384
Huh! I didn't know she was alive
till we damn near knocked her down.

527
00:54:25,054 --> 00:54:28,808
(Donnie)
'She was just standing in the road, frozen.

528
00:54:28,975 --> 00:54:32,186
'I walked over to see if she was OK.'

529
00:54:32,311 --> 00:54:34,814
And she whispered in my ear.

530
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:38,734
- What did she say?
- I think Frank wants me to talk to her.

531
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:42,738
He asked if I knew about time travel.

532
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:48,619
She wrote a book about it,
so that can't be a coincidence, right?

533
00:54:49,829 --> 00:54:51,956
What did she say to you?

534
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:57,420
She said that every living creature
on earth dies alone.

535
00:55:01,549 --> 00:55:03,718
How did that make you feel?

536
00:55:08,055 --> 00:55:11,058
It reminded me of my dog Callie.

537
00:55:12,143 --> 00:55:17,898
She died when I was eight and she
crawled underneath the... the porch.

538
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,696
To die.

539
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:28,367
To be alone.

540
00:55:29,035 --> 00:55:31,912
Do you feel alone right now?

541
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,919
I don't know...

542
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:44,675
I'd like to believe I'm not, but I just...

543
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:50,306
I've just never seen any proof,
so I just don't debate it any more.

544
00:55:50,473 --> 00:55:56,979
I could spend my whole life debating it over
and over and still wouldn't have proof,

545
00:55:57,146 --> 00:56:00,691
so I just don't debate it any more.

546
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:02,985
It's absurd.

547
00:56:06,072 --> 00:56:07,782
The search for God is absurd?

548
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:13,746
It is if everyone dies alone.

549
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:15,998
Does that scare you?

550
00:56:19,335 --> 00:56:22,088
I don't want to be alone.

how beautiful the world can be?

587
01:00:45,351 --> 01:00:47,227
Yeah.

588
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:51,106
And there's some fat guy staring at us.

589
01:01:20,052 --> 01:01:26,183
I don't think telling any woman
to forcibly insert an object up her anus

590
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:30,229
is something
that should go without consequence.

591

I think we should buy him a moped.

592
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:41,240
I think we should get a divorce.

- Why would I?

594

- You tell Mum everything.
- No, I don't.

OK. It's cool.

597
01:02:14,982 --> 01:02:17,359
That's scary.

598
01:02:19,987 --> 01:02:22,197

Thank you for seeing us
at such late notice.

- What I think is going on with your son.

Yes.

602
01:02:36,044 --> 01:02:39,548
Um... Well, he's er...

603
01:02:41,467 --> 01:02:44,887
You know about his past,
and he was suspended from school

604
01:02:45,053 --> 01:02:47,181
for insulting his gym teacher.

605
01:02:47,306 --> 01:02:51,894
I'm not sure that's a good example.
I think he had just cause.

606
01:02:52,019 --> 01:02:56,190
Rose, let me lay out
what I believe is happening here.

607
01:02:59,443 --> 01:03:07,117
Donnie's aggressive behaviour...
his increased detachment from reality,

608
01:03:07,242 --> 01:03:12,539
seem to stem from his inability
to cope with the forces in the world

609
01:03:12,748 --> 01:03:15,042
that he perceives to be threatening.

610
01:03:20,798 --> 01:03:23,008
Has he ever told you about Frank?

611
01:03:27,763 --> 01:03:29,932
Frank?

612
01:03:30,182 --> 01:03:32,017
Yes, the giant bunny rabbit.

613
01:03:33,352 --> 01:03:34,770
The what?

614
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:44,363
I don't recall
him ever having mentioned a rabbit.

615
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:49,117
Donnie is experiencing what is
commonly called a daylight hallucination.

616
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:07,427
This is a common occurrence
among paranoid schizophrenics.

617
01:04:09,388 --> 01:04:15,269
- What can we do?
- I would like to do more hypnotherapy...

618
01:04:17,437 --> 01:04:19,773
and increase his medication.

619
01:04:26,655 --> 01:04:32,202
Whatever will help him, really, is...
That's why we're here.

620
01:04:32,327 --> 01:04:37,833
We just would like him
to experience some relief.

621
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,045
So if you think
that more medication will do that,

622
01:04:43,088 --> 01:04:46,925
then I think we should give it a try.

623
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:57,311
It's complicated.

624
01:04:57,477 --> 01:04:59,187
Yeah?

625
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:03,650
There's like a force in your brain
that just sends you someplace.

626
01:05:04,192 --> 01:05:07,237
Do you go someplace familiar?

627
01:05:07,362 --> 01:05:12,075
No, but each time I keep waking up
farther from my house.

628
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:15,913

631
01:05:33,597 --> 01:05:35,807

(They chuckle)

633
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:46,944
- Good morning, you mongrels!
- Good morning.

634
01:05:47,069 --> 01:05:50,113
Is that all you can muster? Good morning!

635
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:54,952
- Good morning!
- Now, that's a tiny, tiny bit better.

636
01:05:55,118 --> 01:06:00,457
But I still sense some students who are
actually afraid to say "good morning".

637
01:06:00,624 --> 01:06:02,417
Good morning!

638
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:07,714
Yeah, that's what I like to hear!
Too many young men and women today

639
01:06:07,923 --> 01:06:10,676
are completely paralysed by their fears.

640
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:16,098
They surrender their bodies
to the temptation and destruction

641
01:06:16,348 --> 01:06:18,767
of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex.

642
01:06:20,519 --> 01:06:24,147
Now, I'm going to tell you
a little story today.

643
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:28,068
It's a heartbreakingly sad story
about a young man

644
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:32,864
whose life was completely destroyed
by these instruments of fear,

645
01:06:33,073 --> 01:06:38,328
a young man searching for love
in all the wrong places.

646
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:41,707
His name was Frank.

647
01:06:51,842 --> 01:06:55,262
- We're moving through time.
- What?

648
01:06:55,387 --> 01:06:57,597
(Feedback whines)

649
01:06:57,723 --> 01:07:02,102
Hi. My stepsister, like,
I sometimes worry that she eats too much.

650
01:07:02,269 --> 01:07:04,521
- Shut up, Kim!
- I'm just trying to help.

651
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:09,026
Oh, sweetheart, please!
There's no reason to be embarrassed here.

652
01:07:09,151 --> 01:07:15,532
Many times we eat because
we are afraid to face our ego reflection.

653
01:07:15,657 --> 01:07:21,455
We find ourselves looking at the mirror,
rather than into and through the mirror.

654
01:07:21,621 --> 01:07:26,293
When we do that,
we can finally see how beautiful we are.

655
01:07:27,169 --> 01:07:30,297
- Thanks!
- Sure. Come up here. Don't be afraid.

656
01:07:36,303 --> 01:07:39,806
Er, how can I find out
what I wanna be when I grow up?

657
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:47,230
Oh! That's a hard one. Well, look deep
inside of yourself, deep within your heart,

658
01:07:47,355 --> 01:07:54,362
and find what makes you feel love -
pure, unconditional love - and go to that.

659
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:59,409
In your studies, in your athletics,
in your relationships, go towards love.

660
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:02,079
- Thank you.
- Come on up.

661
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:06,750
Next.

662
01:08:11,338 --> 01:08:16,259
- How do I learn how to fight?
- "How do I learn how to fight?"

663
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:22,224
Son, violence is a product of fear.
Learn to truly love yourself -

664
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:26,478
TRULY love yourself -
and the world will be yours.

665
01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:28,855
- OK.
- Get yourself up here!

666
01:08:30,482 --> 01:08:32,526
All right!

667
01:08:35,487 --> 01:08:37,823
- Good morning.
- Good morning!

668
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:42,244
Um... How much are they paying you
to be here?

669
01:08:42,369 --> 01:08:45,080
Er... Excuse me?

670
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:49,543
- What's your name, son?
- Gerald.

671
01:08:49,751 --> 01:08:52,796
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.

672
01:08:52,921 --> 01:08:58,343
Do you want us to buy your book?
Because that was the worst advice ever.

673
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:02,764
See how sad this is?
Want your sister to lose weight?

674
01:09:02,973 --> 01:09:06,810
Tell her to stop eating Twinkies
and play field hockey.

675
01:09:06,935 --> 01:09:13,108
No one knows what they want to be.
It takes time to find that out. Right, Jim?

676
01:09:13,233 --> 01:09:15,360
And you...

677
01:09:15,527 --> 01:09:17,279
Yeah, you.

678
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:22,701
Sick of some jerk shoving your head
down the toilet? Well, lift some weights

679
01:09:22,826 --> 01:09:27,998
or take a karate lesson,
and next time kick him in the balls.

680
01:09:28,665 --> 01:09:34,629
Son... See this? This is an anger prisoner,
a textbook example.

681
01:09:34,838 --> 01:09:38,133
- Prisoner.
- Do you see the fear, people?

682
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:43,805
This boy is scared to death.
Son, it breaks my heart to say this,

683
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:47,976
but I believe you're a very troubled
and confused young man.

684
01:09:48,226 --> 01:09:52,397
- You are searching in all the wrong places.
- You're right, actually.

685
01:09:52,564 --> 01:09:55,817
I am pretty troubled and pretty confused.

686
01:09:56,026 --> 01:10:00,405
And I'm afraid, really, really afraid.
Really afraid, but I... I...

687
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:03,491
I think you're the fucking Antichrist.

688
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:10,665
(Cheering)

689
01:10:16,004 --> 01:10:21,801
It's amazing. He thinks he's telling the
truth. Everything he says is a fucking lie.

690
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:24,179
Everything he says!

691
01:10:24,387 --> 01:10:28,475
Everyone thinks he's so rad.
He's such a fucking chud...

692
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:31,144
Are you OK?

693
01:10:34,439 --> 01:10:37,067
Sit down. Calm down.

694
01:10:42,197 --> 01:10:44,532
You ever hear of Grandma Death?

695
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:47,577
Who?

696
01:10:52,499 --> 01:10:56,544
"The Philosophy Of Time Travel".
What is this?

697
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:58,797
She wrote it.

698
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:11,309
I'm... I'm seeing stuff...

699
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,063
Like really messed-up stuff.

700
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:20,443
That book describes stuff I've been seeing,
and it can't just be a coincidence.

701
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:32,580
(Bell clangs)

702
01:11:32,706 --> 01:11:35,709
She must be in. She never
leaves this house.

703
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:38,670
Maybe she's asleep.

704
01:11:58,315 --> 01:12:00,442
Donnie, look.

705
01:12:10,285 --> 01:12:13,038
(Frank) 'Send her a letter.'

706
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:44,235
(Monnitoff) 'Each vessel travels
along a vector through space-time,

707
01:12:44,402 --> 01:12:46,154
'along its centre of gravity.'

708
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:48,615
Like a spear.

709
01:12:49,783 --> 01:12:53,244
- Pardon?
- Like a spear coming out of your chest.

710
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:57,082
Um... Sure. Yeah.

711
01:12:57,248 --> 01:13:02,879
In order for the vessel to travel through time,
it's got to find a portal, a wormhole or...

712
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:08,802
Could these portals...? Could these portals
just appear anywhere, any time?

713
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:11,054
I think that's highly unlikely.

714
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:17,227
- No, you're talking about an act of God.
- If God controls time, time is pre-decided.

715
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:23,483
- I'm not following you.
- Every living thing follows a set path.

716
01:13:24,275 --> 01:13:29,823
And if you could see your path,
then you could see the future?

717
01:13:29,989 --> 01:13:34,828
- That's a form of time travel.
- Well, you're contradicting yourself.

718
01:13:35,036 --> 01:13:39,457
If we were able to see our destinies
manifest themselves visually,

719
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:44,003
then we would be given a choice
to betray our destinies.

720
01:13:44,129 --> 01:13:50,051
The mere fact that this choice exists would
make all preformed destiny come to an end.

721
01:13:50,218 --> 01:13:54,055
Not if you travel within God's channel.

722
01:13:57,016 --> 01:14:01,187
I'm not going to be able
to continue this conversation.

723
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:06,359
- Why?
- I could lose my job.

724
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:10,238
OK.

725
01:14:18,037 --> 01:14:24,836
It gives me no pleasure to deny you one
of the great writers of the 20th century.

726
01:14:25,003 --> 01:14:31,426
Alas, I have not yet been elected queen
of the universe, so I must obey the rules.

727
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:38,600
So, anyone seen in this school
reading this book will be suspended.

728
01:14:38,766 --> 01:14:45,106
Not to worry. Someone pre-ordered a dozen
copies at the Sarasota Mall bookstore.

729
01:14:46,774 --> 01:14:52,780
In Mr Greene's absence, we will now be
reading another classic - "Watership Down".

730
01:14:57,785 --> 01:14:59,871
Here, Donnie.

731
01:15:00,038 --> 01:15:02,123
Pass these back.

732
01:15:03,333 --> 01:15:06,961
Maybe you and Frank
can read this one together.

733
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,325
(Chuckles)

734
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:22,287
(Frank) 'Now you know where he lives.'

735
01:16:23,830 --> 01:16:28,209
And they grow
out of our... chest, solar plexus?

736
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:32,797
Just like she described,
the way they moved and they smelled.

737
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:35,049
It's like they're workers.

738
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:40,763
Assigned to each one of us.
They just... They're like liquid.

739
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:47,061
I followed it into my parents' bedroom.

740
01:16:47,895 --> 01:16:49,981
What did you find?

741
01:16:54,569 --> 01:16:56,446
Nothing.

742
01:17:00,158 --> 01:17:02,910
So we call them IMGs.

743
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:07,832
- Infant Memory Generators.
- You buy these glasses for your infant,

744
01:17:07,999 --> 01:17:11,377
and they wear them at
night when they sleep.

745
01:17:11,544 --> 01:17:15,298
But inside the glasses
are these slide photographs.

746
01:17:15,465 --> 01:17:20,803
Each photograph is of something peaceful
or beautiful, whatever the parents want.

747
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:23,556
What effect would it have on an infant?

748
01:17:23,765 --> 01:17:28,978
Well, nobody remembers their infancy.
Anybody who says they do is lying.

749
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:32,690
So, this will help develop memory
earlier in life.

750
01:17:32,899 --> 01:17:34,275
Yeah.

751
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:39,864
Did you consider that infants need darkness
as part of their natural development?

752
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:45,453
No.

753
01:17:48,122 --> 01:17:49,540
Yeah.

754
01:17:49,707 --> 01:17:54,504
What if the parents put in pictures
of Satan or dead people?

755
01:17:54,629 --> 01:17:57,090
Is that what you'd show your kids?

756
01:17:58,883 --> 01:18:03,930
Er, well, I mean,
didn't your dad, like, stab your mum?

757
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:10,603
(Mock screeching)

758
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:14,899
Get out.

759
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:18,319
Gretchen!

760
01:18:18,486 --> 01:18:22,198
Gretchen! Gretchen.
I'm sorry about those guys.

761
01:18:50,143 --> 01:18:53,563
- Two for "Evil Dead", please.
- That'll be $2.

762

(* Creepy music)

763
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:44,614
Why do you wear that stupid bunny suit?

764
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:52,705
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?

765
01:20:02,381 --> 01:20:04,592
Take it off.

766
01:20:24,445 --> 01:20:27,073
What happened to your eye?

767
01:20:42,213 --> 01:20:44,340
Why do they call you Frank?

768
01:20:45,967 --> 01:20:48,678
It is the name of my father.

769
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:53,057
And his father before me.

770
01:20:57,353 --> 01:20:58,813
Frank...

771
01:21:02,316 --> 01:21:04,443
when's this going to stop?

772
01:21:04,986 --> 01:21:07,113
You should already know that.

773
01:21:10,658 --> 01:21:12,952
Watch the movie screen.

774
01:21:15,288 --> 01:21:18,457
There's something I want to show you.

775
01:21:26,257 --> 01:21:28,384
Have you ever seen a portal?

776
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:38,686
(Clock chimes)

777
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:50,865
Burn it to the ground.

778
01:22:43,918 --> 01:22:48,339
(* Woman singing gentle melody)

779
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:09,568
OK. Now, girls, I want you to concentrate.

780
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:11,946
Failure is not an option.

781
01:23:12,113 --> 01:23:17,618
And, Bethany, if you feel the need
to vomit up there, just swallow it.

782
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:22,081
- OK, Mum.
- Hey, you guys, good luck out there.

783
01:24:01,078 --> 01:24:03,456
Now, that was really something.

784
01:24:03,622 --> 01:24:06,709
Thank you, Cherita Chen,
with "Autumn Angel".

785
01:24:06,876 --> 01:24:10,087

is that almost all of those people
are full of shit.

01:30:58,036 --> 01:31:01,373
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have another appointment.

843
01:31:02,791 --> 01:31:05,419
You can finish out the week.

844
01:31:11,258 --> 01:31:14,386
Fuck!

845
01:31:36,575 --> 01:31:39,870
Good afternoon.
It's a great pleasure to announce

846
01:31:40,078 --> 01:31:42,456
that the Middlesex Ridge School dance team

847
01:31:42,581 --> 01:31:49,296
has been invited to perform
on "Star Search '88" in Los Angeles.

848
01:32:15,364 --> 01:32:19,952
- 'I know now a terrible thing is coming.'
- 'What do you mean?'

849
01:32:22,454 --> 01:32:26,917
'The field, the field.
It's covered with blood.'

850
01:32:27,584 --> 01:32:30,837
'Blood? Don't be silly.'

851
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:47,688
'All right. It's getting dark.
We should get back to the burrow.'

852
01:32:47,854 --> 01:32:52,693
'Back to the burrow?
It'll come there. It's all around us!'

853
01:32:52,859 --> 01:32:56,321
- 'Stop it, Fiver.'
- 'We've got to leave here.'

854
01:33:04,705 --> 01:33:09,126
When the other rabbits hear of
Fiver's vision, do they believe him?

855
01:33:09,251 --> 01:33:11,837
Why should we care?

856
01:33:12,838 --> 01:33:15,132
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.

857
01:33:16,216 --> 01:33:18,510
Why should I mourn for a rabbit?

858
01:33:18,635 --> 01:33:22,806
Is the death of one species
less tragic than another?

859
01:33:22,973 --> 01:33:26,226
Of course. A rabbit's not like us.

860
01:33:26,351 --> 01:33:31,356
It has no history books, no photographs,
no knowledge of sorrow or regret.

861
01:33:31,523 --> 01:33:36,987
I'm sorry. Don't get me wrong,
I like rabbits. They're cute and horny.

862
01:33:37,154 --> 01:33:41,742
If you're cute and horny, you're happy.
You don't know why you're alive.

863
01:33:41,908 --> 01:33:46,705
You just want to have sex
as many times as possible before you die.

864
01:33:46,872 --> 01:33:51,084
I just don't see the point
in crying over a dead rabbit...

865
01:33:51,293 --> 01:33:54,338
who never even feared death to begin with.

866
01:33:56,131 --> 01:34:01,219
You're wrong. These rabbits are the
product of the author's imagination.

867
01:34:01,386 --> 01:34:07,184
He cares for them, so we care for them,
otherwise we've just missed the point.

868
01:34:09,561 --> 01:34:13,065
Aren't we forgetting
about the miracle of storytelling?

869
01:34:14,900 --> 01:34:18,528
The deus ex machina? The god machine?

870
01:34:20,322 --> 01:34:22,908
That's what saved the rabbits.

871
01:34:29,581 --> 01:34:33,001
No, it was ridiculous. I'll call you back.

872
01:34:34,628 --> 01:34:37,464
- Rose.
- Kitty.

873
01:34:38,757 --> 01:34:42,511
I'm sure you've heard the horrible
allegations against Jim Cunningham.

874
01:34:42,636 --> 01:34:46,056
I know.
Something about a kiddie porn dungeon...

875
01:34:46,181 --> 01:34:49,518
Oh, please, please! Don't use those words!

876
01:34:50,477 --> 01:34:54,356
It's obviously a conspiracy
to destroy an innocent man.

877
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:59,403
I'm spearheading
the Jim Cunningham defence campaign.

878
01:35:01,655 --> 01:35:06,118
Rose, I have to appear
at his arraignment tomorrow morning.

879
01:35:06,326 --> 01:35:09,746
The girls have to leave for Los Angeles.

880
01:35:09,871 --> 01:35:14,626
As their coach,
I was the obvious choice to chaperone them.

881
01:35:14,835 --> 01:35:18,839
- But now you can't go.
- Yes.

882
01:35:18,964 --> 01:35:23,969
Now, believe me, of all the other mothers,
I would never dream of asking you.

883
01:35:24,136 --> 01:35:27,097
But none of the others are available.

884
01:35:29,850 --> 01:35:34,479
I don't know, Kitty.
It's a bad weekend. Eddie's in New York.

885
01:35:35,355 --> 01:35:42,904
Rose, I don't know if you realise what an
opportunity this is for our daughters!

886
01:35:43,155 --> 01:35:48,535
This has been a dream of Samantha's
and all of ours for a long time.

887
01:35:48,702 --> 01:35:52,038
I made her lead dancer!

888
01:35:52,164 --> 01:35:56,960
Sometimes I doubt your commitment
to Sparkle Motion!

889
01:36:27,282 --> 01:36:29,409
Elizabeth will be in charge.

890
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:33,371
She'll drive you to therapy.

891
01:36:33,497 --> 01:36:39,085
And if you need anything, you promise
me that you will call Dr Thurman?

892
01:36:48,428 --> 01:36:52,098
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?

893
01:36:57,229 --> 01:36:59,397
It feels wonderful.

894

895
01:37:35,559 --> 01:37:39,729
- You guys are gonna win. I know it.
- (Sam) So do I.

There's food in the fridge and do not...

897

- I know.
- Bye, Donnie.

901
01:38:02,711 --> 01:38:05,922
OK, go. Go!

902
01:38:28,403 --> 01:38:30,488
Hello, Donnie.

903
01:38:30,697 --> 01:38:35,785
It's Friday. Shouldn't you be off
with your friends, scaring old people?

904
01:38:40,624 --> 01:38:46,463
- What's going on?
- I don't know. That's a good question.

905
01:38:46,630 --> 01:38:50,842
I'm no longer your English teacher.
They fired me.

906
01:38:52,135 --> 01:38:56,306
That's bullshit!
You're the only good teacher here.

907
01:38:59,059 --> 01:39:00,936
Thank you.

908
01:39:02,562 --> 01:39:04,481
What's "cellar door"?

909
01:39:06,566 --> 01:39:11,780
This famous linguist once said that
of all the phrases in the English language,

910
01:39:11,905 --> 01:39:16,660
of all the endless combinations of words
in all of history,

911
01:39:16,785 --> 01:39:19,955
"cellar door" is the most beautiful.

912
01:39:22,332 --> 01:39:24,250
"Cellar door."

913
01:39:55,740 --> 01:40:00,120

everything's gonna be better for you.

914

- (Donnie) 'No.'

916
01:40:21,891 --> 01:40:25,687
'I want to talk about
you and your parents.'

917
01:40:25,812 --> 01:40:29,566
(Donnie) They didn't buy me
what I wanted for Christmas.

918
01:40:30,650 --> 01:40:33,737
What did you want for Christmas that year?

919
01:40:34,529 --> 01:40:37,449
Hungry Hungry Hippos.

920
01:40:39,075 --> 01:40:43,246
How did you feel,
being denied these Hungry Hungry Hippos?

921
01:40:44,289 --> 01:40:48,710
- Regret.
- What else makes you feel regret?

922
01:40:51,004 --> 01:40:55,508
- That I did it again.
- You did it again?

923
01:40:56,468 --> 01:41:02,015
I flooded my school
and I burned down that pervert's house.

924
01:41:02,140 --> 01:41:06,770
(Laughs) I only have a few days left
before they catch me.

925
01:41:06,895 --> 01:41:13,109
- Did Frank tell you to do these things?
- I have to obey him. He saved my life.

926
01:41:14,110 --> 01:41:17,238
I have to obey him or
I'll be left all alone.

927
01:41:17,405 --> 01:41:24,370
And then... And then I won't be able
to figure out what this is all about.

928
01:41:24,537 --> 01:41:27,207

931

- Soon.

What is going to happen?

937
01:42:20,051 --> 01:42:24,264
- Frank is gonna kill.
- Who is he going to kill?

938
01:42:28,017 --> 01:42:31,354
- Who is he going to kill?
- I can see him!

939
01:42:36,776 --> 01:42:38,862
The sky's gonna open up.

940
01:42:45,994 --> 01:42:52,041

there would be no law, no rule.

the existence of God.

You're an agnostic.

who believes that there is
no proof of the existence of God,

953

that God exists.
