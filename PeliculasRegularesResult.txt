ill go along with you on that
greece at the time of pericles
was more civilised than we are now
people will confuse
material progress with civilisation

the greek civilisation
was based on slavery

plato didnt believe in democracy

ted works at the library
im so thirsty
hi
hi
oh
i believe they are
starting up in austria
please
he means the campaign against h weapons
oh it time isnt it
nothing personal
but it was hitler that started it all
it was no more hitler
than you or me
the bomb was a historical necessity
given the scientific know-how
the productive capacity
but hitler was the catalyst
oh im not blaming him any more
than the americans or the russians
or ourselves come to that
do you talk about these things at home
please
like giving the wehrmacht
nuclear weapons

bye eva it been fun
bye keith
hi sorry janet
he went rambling up about metallic
fatigue and the theory of structure
i just couldnt get a word in
that all right
hey wait a sec
my lecturer still away on holiday
did you enjoy your weekend
did the car go well
all right the valves need fixing
like a coffee
hmm
picked up a smashing blonde
on the way home
oh yes
oh nothing
she was just a refugee from
the ban the bomb march
i gave her a lift
how about you
oh you know i gave mum a hand
i tried to get on with my french thesis
dad was gardening
as if you didnt know
ive been thinking
i want to talk to him janet
but what about
weve got to have it out with him
why now so suddenly
suddenly
janet youve said youll marry me
yes when youve finished your degree
what difference does that make
you know how my parents feel about you
theyll help us
till i begin with the firm
no my father feels differently
i told you he came up the hard way
he started off as ordinary porter
at king cross
and now he a traffic manager so what
im sorry janet i admire him for that
you know i do
but what that to do with us
all right keith you talk to him
but dont say i didnt warn you
if it the money side
that bothering you mr bates
you neednt worry
my parents will look after that
your dad could have all the dough
in the world and probably has
but it your future im worried about
how i look at it
a young man should stand
on his own feet
youve a fine career in front of you
and i dont want to see you spoil it
mr bates it always been understood
that im going into
my father business
yes once youve got
your engineering degree
it wont help your studies
to have a wife on your hands
too many other things to think about
but a couple of blokes in my year
are married already
things have changed
good luck to them
but i still say one thing at a time
i never went to college keith
but i do know a thing or two
about marriage
how long do you need
before you finish your course
eighteen months
if i pass my exams in june
just if and if not
another year
well janet can do
what she likes once she 2
though i still hope she takes my advice
dont get me wrong
you two have been going out together
and janet mother and i
would like to see you getting married
eighteen months isnt too long to wait
she worth it isnt she
dont take it too hard son
talk it over with janet
i told you keith
what does he know about it anyway
oh i hope you didnt say that to dad
honey when he was young
people didnt have
six-year degree courses
it not natural to wait so long
poor old dad he never had
the chance to take a degree
they scraped to send me to university
what it to do with us
they had to wait too he was earning
30 bob a week at your age
it all so bloody silly
when there is no money problem
what had he to say to that
oh you know
hard work never did anyone any harm
and all that stuff
you must have thought about it
thought about what
well sex
it not natural for two people
to see each other
as much as we do without
oh it all so stuffy and suburban
but im a suburban girl keith
no youre not janet
i didnt mean it like that
then what did you mean
look im not that kind of girl
and you wouldnt respect me
for it if i was
and you neednt be
so damn smug and prissy about it
oh i never knew it was prissy
to wait until you were married
before sleeping with a man
but ive asked you to marry me
ive gone down on my hands and knees
of course if you cant wait
you speak just like your father
what you dont understand is
it so much easier for a woman
than it is for a man
is it who put that into your head
look ive done my best
but im damned if im gonna submit
to your family views
on love and marriage
theyre out of the ark
if you feel like that
there nothing i can say
i thought youd forgotten
of course not ive been very tied up
i was just passing by
oh yes and you know something
i was looking for you every night
how nicholas
nicholas is fine

in england the man usually asks
but let go
it a bit hot in here

you know i liked going out
oh you liked going out is that all
i thought id met someone
who was different
but you were different
you were unspoilt
i enjoyed being with you
but can i help it if someone young
comes along and i like him
no you cant help it
you cant help a thing
and i didnt go near a woman
the whole time i was away
i lay awake at night
just thinking about you
like a 20-year-old kid
and you dont give a damn
because youre another little tramp
elliot i go in now dont
youre coming back with me
no
let me go
no
all right miss hold on
yeah
he got clean away you feel all right
youd better come down to the station
with me and make a statement
now take it easy dear
come along now
there a good boy there a nice boy
did you get a clear look at him
would you recognise him
if you saw him again
he came from behind
but you told the constable
that he stepped out of a side turning
it was dark
are you quite certain
youve never met him before
look i know youve had a fright
im glad it was nothing more
but if you know anything
it your duty to tell us
in the interests of other women
as well as your own
you havent given us much to go on
im sorry
very well we shall have to book it
assault by person unknown
can i go now
well i cant force you
to do this it up to you
but id like you to see
the police surgeon
but i told you
he didnt interfere with me
all the same
i think it would be sensible
a matter of routine
he here now it wont take a moment
i must get back
youll be through in 0 minutes
good afternoon
youre a new patient arent you
i brought this from the police surgeon
i see
i dont know why he send me
i expect he thought
you should have a check
there nothing to be frightened about
now there are just one or two details
i should like
first of all your name and address
nobody will know treatment here
is absolutely confidential
once ive filled in your card
i shall give you a number
then when you hear it called out
youll go straight in to the doctor
now your name first
koenig eva koenig
and your address
so youve been suffering
from a sore throat and a rash
it was nothing
ive had sores all winter but this
a great many women contract
venereal disease without realising it
oh please dont get upset
the great thing is you came to see us
now tell me about your boyfriends
you do understand me
where do you come from
austria
oh fascinating country
ive spent holidays in the tirol
now i know these are intimate questions
but i need the details
has there been more than one
yes
now tell me about
your most recent boyfriend
when did you first
have intercourse with him
it only happened once
and just two days ago
i see
did either of you use contraceptives
did you know him well
have you got his name and address
i only want to know
in case you have to trace him
i could find him
very well
now you said thered been
a second friend when was that
it was some weeks ago
now im going to take a little blood
so that we can make a test
it isnt painful
just keep your arm steady
syphilis
i told you already
it easy enough to pick up
the main risk is for anyone
to have sex outside marriage
well get you right it lucky
you came to us in the early stages
youll have to attend here regularly
mind you
a girlfriend of mine told me
they stick needles into you
and they expand like umbrellas
oh come on now
youll have your penicillin daily
and in a fortnight
the course will be completed
after that youll need periodic checks
for two years
when do i start
now
oh cheer up
it no worse than the blood test
ill take you through to sister now
but there one other thing
i want you to give one of these slips
to each of those boyfriends
you told me about
so that they come here for examination
oh must i
you caught syphilis
from your first friend
in all probability
youve infected the other two
oh no
and the millars
could i have given it to them
i was coming to that
syphilis is normally passed on
by sexual intercourse
but that rash of yours
means the disease has spread
chance infection could occur
if you were handling a child
nicholas it awful
i dont say it likely
now ill take you through to sister
for your injection
and after that you have a word with
the almoner im sure shell help you
i know how you feel
weve all done things without thinking
of the consequences to other people
what am i to tell mrs millar
theyve been so kind to me
it up to you eva we cant force you
dont you see theyll send me
straight back to austria
and i cant face my father i cant
i cant promise anything
but the millars sound
sympathetic sort of people
it a child
if i were you
id make a clean breast of it
tell mrs millar to go to their family
doctor who can get a report from us
now that youre getting
regular injections
therell be no danger to nicholas
if that what worrying you
um ill try
you do that
now about these young men
you say you cant contact
this first friend
eva ive heard about the assault
are you certain you dont know the man
who attacked you
i i
nothing you say to me
will go outside these four walls
not even to the police
i think itd be sensible
for you to tell the police
but as far as were concerned no
not even to the police
yes it was elliot
my first friend
but im frightened
frightened of what hell do
in that case
you can send him the slip by post
if i know his sort
it wont be the first
you know his address
yes
then we seem to be on the way
to settling our problems
youll see the other two
and speak to them
i dont know where keith lives
i dont know anything about him
except he wonderful
but hell ring me
or turn up at the club im sure
keith
hello janet
youve been avoiding me
well after that row i didnt think
you wanted to see me again
oh you know that isnt true
if two people cant have a row
without one of them going off
and sulking oh come on now
ive been thinking about you
all the time
well maybe it was my fault
i suppose
i must have sounded pretty smug
honestly keith
the way you put it to me
i behaved like a bloody fool
i dont know what came over me
then what the matter
janet it isnt that
what
well after we quarreled
i was feeling pretty fed up
i went to a club
you know that girl i told you about
from austria
the blonde
im sorry janet
ill never see her again
keith you didnt
oh keith why did you have to tell me
oh i suppose you were right
id have been much unhappier
if you’d simply gone on
as if nothing had happened
i must dash now
shall we go out tonight
yes let where
let go to the pictures
well go and see a sad film
and have a good cry
fine
bye
eva i just dont know what to say
oh ill have to tell my husband
well obviously well all
have to go to the doctor
first thing in the morning
i did warn you
if only youd paid
the slightest attention to what i said
im sorry mrs millar
it a fine time to say youre sorry
when i think of nicholas
oh it all so loathsome
i didnt know
i didnt think i was harming anyone
oh now come on eva
at least you had the courage
to tell me straight out
and you said they said at the clinic
that it wasnt very likely that
there your family to think about
hello keith will you come in
hello
all right just to say hello
you thought you were in for
a rough time with dad didnt you
theyve gone out for the evening
oh well that a relief
fine way to start an evening
oh ive got some new records
you must hear them
but if we’re going to the pictures
oh let not rush off to the pictures
i havent seen you for ages
ill fix us some supper
that if you could make do with
scrambled eggs or baked beans on toast
anything
then have a drink
while we make the big decision
dad got some beer on the ice
beer fine
difficult arent you
sorry im on my best behaviour tonight
if im gonna slave over a hot stove
for you ill just run up and change
the beer in the fridge help yourself
okay
janet
jan
are you there
janet
you dont have to do that
i want to
i was wrong
everything you said was right
i nearly lost you
you never lost me
i always wanted you
even
and i want your children
keith the lights
darling
we must be careful if id have known
darling i knew
yeah she gave me that form
a fortnight ago
but i knew there was nothing
to worry about
oh how
well you see i work in a library
i looked it up in a medical dictionary
i see
well i knew i neednt worry
after all we didnt sleep together
and if we did id have taken
the necessary precautions
im sorry to tell you that if you
have intercourse with a woman
suffering from venereal disease
no precautions are safe
well then like i said
that question dont arise
but there was sexual contact
if you can call it that
you know how it is
i petted her a bit kissed her
on the mouth
yeah
then what decided you to come here
well now that you mention it
it was a sore ive got
just inside my mouth here
well i mean nothing much
but me neck swollen a bit there
thought i might as well
come for a check
let me see please
cant do any harm
open your mouth wider
hmm
ill be giving you
a thorough examination next door
but unless im very mistaken
that a syphilitic sore on your lip
she was so young and inexperienced
of course i wont be seeing her again
wont catch me with that kind of girl
hello eva
so you finished the course now

youd only have worried
we both knew it was a risk
but some people try for months with
i dont regret it do you

it was the only possible way
for us to get married
with dad feeling like he did
have you told them

well see them together
and get it over with
your father will be after me
with a shotgun
please take me home
im sorry janet that wasnt funny

it just didnt seem any other way out
i dont blame you
if anyone to blame it myself
dont worry darling
well see it through
there no point in putting it off
will your father be in now

hello may i speak
to miss koenig please
please
it you quite a time
you led me a regular dance didnt you
never mind
we wont say anything more about that
ive been along for my medicine
like a good boy
i dont want to speak to you
mr millar says youre not to ring
you havent been telling stories
have you not to the police
i didnt tell the police
anything about you
there a sensible girl
i dont want to talk to you
im going back to austria
i ran into your boyfriend the other day
havent been seeing him have you
hello
you mean keith
yes that right keith murray
small world isnt it
i told you i was in advertising
we handle his fathers account
murray construction
i bumped into him at their offices
with his fiancée
his fiancée
yes i thought youd be interested
now look eva about us
keith
i thought you were not coming
eva what can i say
i behaved very badly
i should have rung you or something
how did you find my number
it doesnt matter
keith i couldnt tell you
on the telephone
eva what is it
they told me to give it to you at once
i didnt know how to find you
i thought you would ring me
kensington hospital
i dont get it
they want you to go
there a special clinic
theyll explain to you
you see there was someone else
and he was sick
i didnt know about such things
you know the notices in toilets
oh my god
they give you injection
make you better soon
there no need for anyone to know
no
i didnt tell you im engaged
i heard a friend told me
what you dont know is she pregnant
oh hello keith
hello ruth
have you come to see roger
yes
well come in then
thank you
hello tracy
havent seen you for ages
you know exams and everything
i have to congratulate you
we read the announcement
in the local rag last week
thanks
we met her remember
youre a very lucky young man
oh that damn telephone
the secretary is away this afternoon
roger wont be too long
dont worry about me
hello keith nice to see you
hello roger
come on through
thanks
i was delighted to hear about
the engagement keith really delighted
roger i think im in a hell of a mess
oh what kind of mess
ive just been handed this
i see
well suppose you tell me all about it
i dont want you to think
ive been sleeping around
especially now
it only happened once and
there were reasons for that
yes im sure
look ill go to the clinic
if you think i should
but i just wondered if there was
some way of checking privately
tell me have you noticed any rash
any spots on your genitals
no nothing
well first of all
ill give you an examination
and then ill arrange for a blood test
hugh price can do that for us
if it should prove to be positive
i could of course
arrange to treat you privately
but my advice would be to
take advantage of the clinic
anyway lets get on
with the examination
hello
eva
are you alone
oh it you
elliot stop it
i wont listen i wont
what on earth the matter with eva
another of those obscene phone calls
becoming a real menace
him again
he got eva really scared
the man seems to have
some kind of obsession about her
well weve got to do
something about this
do you think you could persuade her
to go to the police
it wouldve saved a lot of trouble
if she had done it before
well it asking an awful lot
of the girl in her present state
but ill try
eva
oh miss koenig
i believe you have
some further information for us
i was so frightened
i couldnt tell you
you think you could identify
the man who assaulted you
i know him
why didnt you tell us this before
it was some months ago now
what made you change your mind
because he keeps phoning me
it not only myself the millars
these telephone calls are they abusive
does he threaten you
he says such terrible things
what hell do to me
improper use of the telephone
is an offence
there no need to be frightened
now that youve come to us
can i have his name please
collier elliot collier
and do you know where he lives
yes he has a flat
number  alban court
in the king road
well that not too far away
well soon put a stop to this
sergeant davis please
collier left that address
rather hurriedly some weeks ago
the day after the incident in the mews
i expect
we shall have to get
the millars permission
to have their telephone monitored
please
oh it means that if anyone rings up
well be listening
and the next time collier rings you
keep him talking
but you neednt listen
to what he has to say
just let him talk
we need time for what weve got to do
so at all costs you must keep him
on the other end
it may not be very pleasant
will you do it
yes i will
what i dont understand is how
i couldve caught this without knowing
you were unlucky
there usually a sore on the genitals
but sometimes
it no more than a pimple
it doesnt hurt and it soon disappears
doesnt that mean it cured
no it means that the infection has
entered on a more serious stage
no one can be cured
of syphilis or gonorrhea
without professional medical treatment
it never crossed my mind
it rarely does
anyone who indulges in shall we say
casual intercourse
would be well-advised to come in
for a regular check
especially if they’re
thinking of marriage
ill give it to her today
i dont know how im going to tell her
well if youll go back
to waiting room now
there are some further tests to be made
doctor
yes
shell be all right
oh i see no reason why not
provided she reports promptly
after all we dont know
that you infected her
and the baby
you say she rather more than
two months pregnant
oh the baby too
if we see her in time
can i tell her that
you can
but send her here soon
that the important thing
thank you sir
yes
am i disturbing you doctor
no sister come in
makes you think
that young fellow i just saw
decent well-educated young boy
and he risks his marriage
through crass ignorance
that and a lack of moral sense
like you id blame the parents
as much as anybody
young people should be told
and told early
there a lot id like to tell these
young things who come sailing in here
it so often a matter of ignorance
these latest figures 40000 new cases
a year and most of them young people
they should know what happens
when syphilis goes untreated
heart disease paralysis with blindness
insanity stillbirths
and with gonorrhea sterility
in women and children born blind
mild enough diseases at the start
but over the years
they take a terrible toll
listen down the slope and past the hut
ill come with you if you like
no no thank you
well youll see the notice
special clinic
thanks it a great help
janet please dont take it like this
ive never been to a doctor
to tell him im an unmarried mother
and that the man
who got me pregnant has vd
i know
but were over the worst
are we
you say it cant hurt the child
but ive read about cases
have you ever seen a mentally
deficient child because i have
janet the doctor told me
itll be all right
this just doesnt happen to people
who respect their own bodies
i feel so cheap like a common tart
were over the worst of it
will you stop saying
were over the worse of it
i mean weve told your parents
about having the baby
there no need for them to know
anything about this
it doesnt make it any better
by hiding it
you havent told them
no i havent
it doesnt make me feel any better
look
as soon as were both in the clear
im going straight
to the registry office
to arrange about getting married
just a few weeks now
no youre not keith
there isnt going to be a marriage
eva i think youd better answer that
hello
this is you-know-who
now you listen to me
is someone there i can hear music
i was listening to the records
eva are you still there
dont hang up on me
yes im still here
yes i heard you elliot
women police sergeant carnall speaking
oh you have
he on the line now
have you traced the call
yes of course ill wait
call box chelsea manor street
embankment inn
thanks a lot ill pass it on
ive done nothing wrong
let me go
you cant do this to me
hey max remind you of someone
should it
well it could be couldnt it
hey that girl really did
something to you didnt she
she taught me one thing
no mucking about from now on
the next girl i go out with
is going to be steady
and when i get married
she got to be a virgin
oh come on
dont take it so much to heart
oh look let go
we got to get cracking
if we’re gonna get rid of this lot
miss bates
yes
you dont know me but
did keith send you
no no he had nothing to do with it
oh well come in then
thank you
please sit down
thank you
im leaving for home tomorrow
youre going back
yes
i wanted to see you and say i was sorry
oh it was his fault more than yours
i didnt know
that he was engaged to you
we werent engaged then
it was just something
that was understood
will it be all right about the baby
well ill have to go back
for observation
and ill be making blood tests
for a long time
well you must know yourself
they say im all right
im so happy
have you seen keith lately
i phoned to say i was going home
he would like to see you he so upset
he upset
if he would like to see me
oh why are men so stupid
janet
oh hello
we must talk
eva rang me she told me what you said
i mean about the medical check
and i suppose that makes
everything all right
of course it doesnt
that why i had to see you
look ive spoken to my father
the baby my responsibility
as well as yours
i dont want any money from you
or your father
if that what youre getting at
you must be realistic
we may not be millionaires
but well manage
hell be brought up at home
and later on
i mean youve got to face it
your father isnt so young
ill get myself a job
as soon as ive finished at college
im not as helpless
as you seem to think
i never thought
you were helpless janet
that wasnt why i asked you to marry me
what will you call him
you seem to think itll be a him
keith that isnt fair
i do have my feelings
so do i
and youre not giving me a chance
janet
look maybe youll marry somebody else
but the baby needs a father
ill never marry anybody else
how could you be so cruel
all this talk about money cant you see
it not your money i want it you
you said
you shouldnt listen to what i say
you ought to know how i feel
silly
well if were going to be unhappy
wed better be unhappy together

oh that was
that was selma
we were
a little plastered
it did more for you
than your samples
yes but it was
a joke
yeah well wait
til you meet him
youll understand
frankly i dont like drawings
my daughter draws
photographs
on the other hand
tell the whole story
and no mistakes
for example i know
it a small point
but it happens
to irritate me
we sell heavy-duty
trucks
to hard-headed
engineering-minded
cost-conscious
businessmen
why you fellas find it
necessary
to put half-naked girls
in our advertisements
isit beyond me
mr lepridon we could
take the girls out
look ill stay with him
ill call you later
i tell you
we built things
that people said
couldnt be done
except
at financial loss
so we went ahead
and built them anyway
well everything seems
to be coming along just fine
of course i really dont know
what the hell it is
im looking at
i guess you might say
the only thing i know is trucks
but i know
i like that bridge out there
that brooklyn bridge
if they ever condemn that
why im going to buy it
have it transported
to indiana by truck

to our plant in indiana
at your own expense

would find trucks uh
pedestrian

even squares have their moments
she cute
she a nurse
so was i and look what
happened to me
well in those days
a marriage licence only cost
about two pounds
that a real bargain
that nearly six times more
than a dog licence
that a fascinating thought
exactly
so dont knock it
no no
just supposing your decision had
gone the other way
you might have been here tonight
cha-cha-ing with a great dane
well at today prices
oh shut up
and buy me another drink
before we go

of a wife who tries to put her
husband to bed on
new year eve
im all for it
as long as she stays here

bore and id love to dance

camera i thought he might
have brought it
well he taken ward duty tonight
why is there always
some reason i have
to go back to that hospital
you know at fifty point two
grains per head i estimate
itll take half the city supply
of bicarbonate of soda
to settle this lot hangovers
well to ease the situation
ive arranged to have
mine in le touquet
try not to miss us too much
im sorry i didnt mean to intrude
oh steven
hello ruth

rheumatism fibrositis
sciatica and gout and
and hayfever
and youll be the
fittest person that ever died of exposure
woo
come on

steven exhales loudly
so have my cigarettes
how much time do we have
oh darling youre such a damned
fool sometimes
you know we cant go now
cant go

well darling let be honest
if the boy been around
for three weeks
this isnt just an isolated case
it could be the start of an outbreak
all right so it could be an outbreak
i-im not the only doctor in town
im tired washed out
i need this holiday julie
of course you do
youve been working non-stop for years
you deserve it but i dont
and what does that mean
im staying
youre staying
but why in the name of---
because i can help
how
they might call for volunteer nurses
im still qualified
you think youre dedicated to
crisis by birth dont you
it has some sort of
fascination for you
not dedicated just obstinate
ill get my cases
julie
should have married someone outside
your own profession steve
someone who wouldnt know
about these things
so im supposed to
go off alone having a wonderful spree while
you stay here and play the martyr
darling dont turn this into a duel
you need the rest it might even
be good for us to be
apart for a while
no i-i-im not
going to let you make me ashamed
of this holiday julie
you cant
not often we have a bust-up is it
this isnt a bust-up
for you it is
i need you with me
you owe this to me julie
telephone ringing
shall i get it
hello
it clifford steve
you were right
the lab confirmed it weve
had a second case
brought in and the moh
is circulating all general practitioners
so perhaps youd leave a
note for your locum
of course
who the second case
commissionaire
the theatre royal
the hospital under immediate quarantine
you just got away in time
im not away yet
how far is the first case from the theatre
three miles across town
which means it travelled through about
eighty thousand people
steven ive been trying to get
ruth there no reply
you said julie took her home
yes
yes she did
well i wouldnt worry
she probably asleep
yes thanks clifford
well
he er cant get any reply
from ruth
oh the hell with ruth
it is an outbreak isnt it
why dont we get some sleep julie
may not be any for some time
you dont have to stay steve youre right
youre not the only doctor in town
im the only doctor in town whose
wife always wins
wish i could believe that
were all right julie
were all right
church bell chimes
disinfection unit reporting sarge
disinfection who for
oh nothing personal sarge -
so dont take offence
it too early for laughs
some place at fairhaven
chief health inspector said report to him here
better report then
oh
standing by sir
the moh will be wanting you shortly
ready when he is sir
ere what all this then
there a meeting
what eight oclock
moh office
yeah well no one been up this
early since the royal visit
and ive also given instructions that
once an ambulance has been
used to pick up a case
it must not be used for any
other purpose
ill advise my men
yes try and keep the same
vehicle for all new cases
sounds like youre expecting more
i wish i wasnt so sure
sorry weve been waiting for
confirmation of another case
a third
did you get it
it in a modified form but im
afraid it number three
where
the davis house again the woman son
the steward
he quarantined of course
yes indeed
as soon as we knew about
the first case
we also found out the
boy went to the
theatre royal on his first
night leave
which ties up the two cases
so there no doubt he
the missed case
in my opinion none
top priority now is to identify
all primary contacts
and the immediate vaccination of all
police emergency services
postal staff in fact every public
servant in the city
look i dont want to underestimate
the situation
but after all three cases i mean
take precautions yes
but dont you think were
blowing it up a little
out of proportion
mr town clerk
i cannot say this too emphatically
this virus is a killer
yes we do only have three cases
but tomorrow it could be thirty-three
in two weeks a thousand and three
unless we contain it now
fair enough
next question
how much of this do i
give to the press
everything as far as im concerned
we desperately need their help
ask them to try and put this
over to the
public without causing a panic
in that case id better talk
to the editor
unless there something else
no i dont think so
thank you ladies and gentlemen
we cant get things moving too quickly
youd better alert the transport department
im going over to the chronicle
call the doctor in would you
see if doctor preston left yet
yes sir
mr buckridge
i know youll instruct your inspectors
very thoroughly
theyre in my office now
youve a tough assignment

working in liaison with you
make it seven

door and asking for help

how do you know when a
marriage is past help
when two people stop liking each other
people cant like each other all the time
even if theyre still in love
is that why you left
ive gone out
you know other people wives are
helping without packing their bags
thanks
maybe ive used this as an excuse to step
outside our marriage for a while and
try to take a look at us from a distance
are we that unbearable close to
we havent been close to for a long time
even when were together were not
really together any more
were never relaxed with each other
like now
like now
there always a
antagonism i dont know
such as arguing about when
to leave a dance
oh that not important
or how a doctor
shouldnt run away on a holiday
oh leave it steve drop it
drop what
nine years of our lives
darling were both too tired to think or
feel or understand anything
let leave it until all this is finished
us or the epidemic
for god sake julie of all times to play
games with our marriage

well look at us right now at this minute
we were having a tough enough time when
things were normal but now

youre going to be all right

i cant really ask a priest for a bedpan
where are they kept
i dont want one i just said it
out of devilment
id like to shout awful things at matron
trouble is i wouldnt really mean them
she runs this place like a battleship and i
admire competent people

got my eleven plus
youve come to give the last sacrament
i could hardly do that
you belong to a rival firm dont you
julie speaks sleepily

julie gives a little sobbing noise
i love you steve
that was a stupid thing to do father
for a man of your intelligence
were exposed to gross contamination
in here all of us every minute
there no time for dangerous heroics
they tell me you run this place
like a battleship matron
i try to run it like a hospital
and all i ask is that you dont do
such a foolish thing again
yes matron
matron

you in a state doctor

she in side ward two and
she very comfortable
ill be around if i can be of any help
thanks
what happened
she collapsed the night before last
they found her in the disinfection shower
night before last
why wasnt i told
mainly because your wife asked us not to
she insisted it was merely fatigue
and the heat of the steam
but we took precautions and
put her to bed
i see
she just gone to sleep doctor
she hasnt had much sleep lately
so unless you really need to disturb her
no no i wont disturb her
oh excuse me matron
there some volunteers at
the front gate

in state
gentle music starts to play
steven thoughts

or for being loved
but it you i want julie
i know now
dont let it be too late
steven remembering
julie wish i could believe that
steven were all right julie
steven were all right
steven thoughts
if youre going to die julie
you have to know what possessed me
steven remembering
steven i was able to un-mix myself
ruth were you steven
steven thoughts
what did you ever do to make me
less glad to see you
what have you done now to make me
need so much to see you again
steven remembering
ruth steven
darling
ive been a great help havent i
go back to sleep
ill be here
nightingale rides again
i should have checked your take
you hadnt taken
it my fault
rushing around being so competent
just forgot
listen julie
you mustnt touch me steve
i touch what i like and what i love
beautiful
but you mustnt
ive wanted to tell you why ive been
so impossible lately
it isnt easy and im---
then dont
is it all right now
it going to be
ive got to work it out when there
time and some peace
poor love
im not much help
came on me while i wasnt watching

and then i was in it up to my neck
steve
if i die---
you wont die julie
i might there a fifty-fifty chance
ive been infectious for two weeks steve
i want you to have a test
now you stop worrying
im still organising arent i
doctor monks you really must let her sleep
matron where doctor preston
i ordered him to go down and eat
and i wouldnt be surprised if that
didnt apply to you too
and youre not getting enough sleep matron
you should be a good judge of that doctor monks
a glass of wine wouldnt do you any harm
clifford youre sure it modified
you can see the report for yourself
do we know where she picked it up
the sombrero coffee bar i saw
her name on the list
her vacc hadnt taken of course
why wasnt she checked
you know julie
anyway youre lucky luckier than i am
you just heard your wife isnt
going to die and
im terrified of losing mine in a different way
is she still in london
yes
let get out of here
you dont really mean youre
afraid of losing ruth
did i say that
have you heard from her
look steven
there enough trouble around without
trying to find more but
id like to get something straight
have you and ruth ever stayed
anywhere together
i-i mustnt leave any doubt
as to what i mean
have you ever made love to her
why torture yourself
there wont be a brawl or
anything like that it
just that i must know
yes i have
i knew it
i had to be sure so i could face up to it
would it help you to know it was
all over a long time ago
with ruth it never over
we got a new one right out of nowhere
place called the crossings hotel
on the bristol road a man named bradley
what do you mean right out of nowhere
well it not on any of our lists
must be a missed case
god help us if it is
who there
nobody yet
the hotel just telephoned
people there sound a bit weird but
from what we can gather the man
very ill and we dont have a doctor
well find one
where the moh
well he gone off
to shipton lane
i thought wed sent doctor scott-james
yes yes i know but there a
fog coming up on the outskirts
and he lost in it
all right then call the hospital
they must have someone
if not find whoever off duty and
pull them out of bed
right
if there a carrier still moving
weve got to know about it and fast
you all right sir
it beating us
what are we going to do
what are we going to do
you come and sit in the car for a while
come on
oh im sorry i-i can wait
no come in
it doctor monks isnt it
yes im through now
well how your wife
the fever abated a little
oh good
i was talking to her earlier on she was
good enough to receive me
im sure you did her a lot of good
father maguire gives a little laugh
she hadnt much time for me but
still she did her best to entertain me
that does sound like my wife
mmm youre more sure of your
feelings now are you
i dont know
you dont know
maguire makes a tutting noise
then you must be taking stock
of course that what usually happens
i suppose you said to yourself
if i could have her back everythingd be different
and now she is back
everything is different
isnt it
i wish i felt that
i wish i knew what i felt
these things are happening to me all the time
i dont feel them
i didnt love my wife
then i thought she was going to die
now she not
and the most i can feel is that
other people are different
she different too
youre listening arent you
yes im listening
it not enough
maybe im
changed by these things -
but it not enough
i ought to
feel them i ought to be moved by them
steven shouts angrily
i dont register anything
it not that you dont
but you darent
what do you mean
well youre afraid of showing your feelings
you dont want people to see them
huh
ive been shouting
im sorry
maguire gives a little laugh
ah that all right
sure it did you good
yes you think everything does
you good dont you
getting drunk shouting
making love to another man wife
would you say that did you good
steven shouts
would you
you all right in ere
yes yes were perfectly all right thank you
anything you want
a couple of cigarettes wouldnt go amiss
ah now youll have to wait
till you go through
ill leave them in the porter office
i have some in the clean room
you see im trying to cut down and---
yes yes an excellent idea
yes shouting is a good outlet
shouting and crying are the simplest
forms of communication
we cant stand suffering alone anymore
we want somebody to share it
and when they dont well we get
angry and frightened
but you neednt worry
i can take all you can give
what about those cigarettes
you see i leave them in there purposely
because if you havent got it
you may want it but you cant have it
as the duchess said to the
to the sailor
yes that right it was a sailor
the last time i heard it
dyou---
oh thanks
do you remember what you were
saying to me just now
i think so why
well you mentioned something about adultery
did i
well i im not sure
well if i did ill stick to it
it true
im out of gas
ah thanks
i suppose ive just been given confession
as youre so fond of saying it did me good
im sorry there no penitence
only regret
i dont mean i regret doing it
im just sorry it was done
mmm youd like everybody to
forget about it is that it
im sorry for the man that all
but not your wife no
no because she doesnt know
about it so she isnt hurt by it
it doesnt diminish her
ah
im speaking quite normally arent i
oh yes quite normally
im sorry for the man because it hit
him where it hurts most
yes well you see this man has
asked me for advice
and what have you advised him
i thought id talk to you first
and now that youve talked
well im still not sure
and he feels very strongly that he ought to
talk to your wife when she well enough
and tell her ive been unfaithful
is that what you mean
i broke into his house so naturally he has
the right to break into mine
ah well then
not exactly that
it exactly that
im not objecting it jungle logic
and i accept it
mmm
well after all you broke into his house
to ravish his wife didnt you
oh come what
im liable to be amused at the idea of
my wrenching at the front door with a jemmy and
rushing upstairs to pin a screaming
woman to the bed
ah well now it wasnt i who introduced
the simile of housebreaking
all right i chose a bad phrase
in cold hard fact
we met in london by mutual consent
and shared a very civilised meal
before retiring to an anonymous hotel room
mmm hmm
and you find this extenuating
i find it very hard to defend myself against
your sort of blackmail father
it not a question of blackmail
no he just wants to
tell my wife and remove the barriers
i take it that means the natural reserve
of privacy that exists between
two people who spend their lives together
and is there a need for er
privacy
yes
i think the idea of
complete intimacy between two human beings is
undignified and insufferable
must they
clean their teeth in front of each other and
leave the lavatory door open
yes well he thinks you cant open up
your mind to your wife anymore
without watching your step
without having to remember
well a certain place a certain time
you know in case you make a slip
so what do you suggest i do
ah it not for me to suggest
well what does he want me to do
he threatens to
hurt my wife and embarrass me by
exposing an affair that best forgotten
i know
all right well what are his terms
are you prepared to meet them
i am not prepared to let anyone bust in
and break up our future
if he so insistent about it
ill tell her myself
you understand at last
what do i understand
that those would be his terms
oh excuse me
the mo on the phone for you doctor
it through to the porter office
right-o thank you
and your gear nearly done father
just the way you like it
rare inside and flared on the outside
yes
yes tim
sorry to do this to you steve
it an moh emergency call
the crossings hotel
ive no idea but there an inspector
waiting at the guildhall he knows
ah it seems theyre short of
doctors down there
can you still stand up
no
but since when did that matter
right
i have some work to do in town
just in case you thought i was running out on you
oh not at all of course not
pity isnt it
that a disinfection room can
only cleanse the outside
trouble with buckridge is he so worried
somebody isnt going to do it
right he does everything himself
id say he heading for a nervous breakdown
a nervous breakdown is a great institution
it when you dont have one that you
come apart at the seams
well that comforting
you know this road pretty well
like the back of my hand
mind you ive a suspicion he realises
weve a few half-wits in the department
are we anywhere near
what
the crossings hotel
about two miles

sound of screeching and scraplng
are you all right

turn that bloody engine off
have a look around
they must have been thrown out
hello are you there
hello are you there
ill bring the car back

well they couldnt have been thrown out
must have climbed out through here
well theyve cleared off
how do we know
weve looked weve shouted
well if theyre unconscious---
they climbed out
ran off a bit
lost consciousness again
and youre a doctor you know it could happen
my common sense tells me they cleared off
probably a stolen car---
well im going to keep on searching
all right you keep on searching
im going up to the crossings hotel
ill call the police
but they might be dying
someone dying at the hotel
ill see to him first since the
others arent available

julie gives a little laugh
i used to see the strangers
in the ward on visitor day
curled up with embarrassment with
one eye on the clock and
the relief on their faces when the time was up
come on into bed
i saw one man jam his hat on and run
they found him later in the nurses room
because hed lost his way in his hurry
he was madly in love with his wife
theyd only been married a year
and he was off like a shot
when the time was up
and his poor little wife was in tears about it well
she was a post-caesar and a bit weepy anyway
when they told her that hed been
dragged out of the nurses room
she was hysterical
so if they find you in the nurses room later
darling i wont cut up rough
you should tell me to shut up steve
untll youre less busy
gentle romantic music
julie are you
when this is over are you coming home
i havent been very certain that
you wanted me home
that why im asking
with things on your mind steve you
werent very easy to get through to any more
am i so difficult to understand
youre a very private person steve
people think you have no heart
because you dont flash it around
only thing is it makes it difficult for me
to get through to you when i must
and there are times when i must
because i love you
i want you back julie
thanks
ill er
try and have the place cleaned up a bit
steven gives a little laugh
er mrs chalmers never waters anything
but ive um
looked after your pink cyclamen
and it going strong
im a bit weepy im sorry
well youll feel better if i go
yes i-i can enjoy my cry
mr bradley mumbles incoherently
that should settle him down for the next two hours
am i disturbing you
shall i call you or sister if necessary
ill be on call
somebody telephoned about
ten minutes ago doctor asking about him
she wouldnt give her name
if he regains consciousness tell him please
meanwhile spray the nose mouth and throat
and keep up with the compresses
mr bradley muttering
no
i understand he refused to see father maguire
but if it becomes necessary you
could ask him to come here
mr bradley continues to babble
doctor monks this woman been
exposed to gross contamination
wherever she goes she a
menace to human life
if youre quite sure about this thing
i think doctor preston should be told
look if i thought it would help us to find her
id tell him but it wont
he must have some idea
no he hasnt he thinks she still in london
where in london
i dont know
i tried to ask but
i-i cant press the point
mr buckridge
doctor preston is doing four men work
up at the hospital he as tired and
exhausted as you and i
god knows what thisd do to him right now
you see im not used to this sort of thing
im sorry for doctor preston
well then let try and help him
what i dont understand
she
she a doctor wife
she must realise she a carrier
why run away
because there were people coming from here
people who might recognise her
she must be staying somewhere with someone
i believe she isolated herself
of her own free will
then she mad
no desperate
she left her jewellery everything when she fled
i think she keeping away from people
till she knows whether she infected or not
yet according to you she just
used the telephone
leaving the virus on the mouthpiece
the flex---
a knock on the door
what is it
you asked for more coffee
oh did i
doctor
no no thanks
have you finished with the tray
is the new master list ready
oh the stencils are cut
but mr collins said not to run them
until doctor boswell got back
why
in case he had anything new to add
you tell mr collins
no ill tell him
while this woman is at large
were sitting on a volcano
but ill go along with you
thank you
up to a point
if i tell anyone her real name
itll be because itll help to trace her
that all i can promise
that all i can ask
i know im late
hello steve you look terrible
let me return the compliment
i had to deal with a fire coming back
fire anyone hurt
no just an aa box
an aa box
yes
what happened at the crossings hotel
we filled it with formaline and sealed it up
moved the family to a vacant house
where was this aa box
up at the crossings
yeah what about that family
well youve met them havent you
wanted the dogs vaccinated too
you should have seen
scott-james face---
tim was there a telephone
what
in that box
yes that about all there was
four gutted uprights and a smashed telephone
probably some irate member
i think doctor monks
believes it might have been mrs bradley
are you serious
a woman telephoned the hospital
asking for bradley
she wouldnt leave her name
the operator thought it came from a call box
but why should mrs bradley set
fire to a call box
it a drastic measure of disinfection
knowing it might have been contaminated
well that presuming the woman
has some knowledge---
do we have to presume she hasnt
it a theory tim
if we want to find this woman
we shouldnt sneer at theories
all right steve simmer
well let the police comb over the whole area
maybe the army will help too
a sergeant calling you
from downstairs doctor
anything to add before we run sir
yes smiths
doctor monks
there a lady wishing to see you doctor
well outside sitting in a car
she wouldnt give her name
just said it was personal and very urgent
ill be down
dear god no
pardon me
church bell ringing in the distance
doctor monks
doctor steven monks
that right
can we talk in here
it about ruth
ruth preston
where is she
i was hoping you could tell me
are you a friend of ruth
joanna druten ive known her for ages
so naturally ive heard about you
i see
im sure i can talk in confidence
you can
when did you last see her
new year day
well she arrived at my place in london
she was depressed and hungover and wanted
to stay the night
mmm im ahead of you
when she heard about the outbreak
she told everybody she was still with you and
came down here to stay with bradley
at the crossings hotel
how much of this do you already know
it doesnt matter i know ruth
she told me where she was so that i
could cover for her from my end
when did she meet him
brad
mmm
oh years ago
it was a big thing
then it suddenly broke up and he went abroad
and now theyve met again
mmm two months ago
so when they broadcast for mrs bradley
you knew who they meant
well i was frantic
i rang the hotel
they said that everybody had left
and they were sealing the place up
i couldnt ring clifford
no
so i came down here to see you
the whole thing pretty messy isnt it
yes
but necessity drives us a long way
if i hear anything ill let you know
thank you joanna druten im in the book
i wish i didnt feel so hellishly responsible
we have a lot in common
ominous music
dogs barking
as there have been no new cases
for uh nearly a week would you say youve
beaten the epidemic mr buckridge
there are four more days of infection period
if we stay in the clear that long
then i think we can say weve beaten it
dramatic music
any optimistic hope that were on
top of this epidemic is madness
until we find mrs bradley
do you know for certain she infected
sharing her husband bed id say
it almost a certainty
so by now she must be dangerously ill
telephone rings
yeah
what i dont get is why she
doesnt want treatment
right thank you
it very odd
very odd
is it another one
no
bradley died
see that his name is changed to
the proper column
that makes it seventeen
housewife doorman debutante
typesetter prostitute stockbroker
but the urns are all the same shape
buckridge
bad news
i came to let you know ive decided to tell preston
that the best news ive heard for three weeks
i had no right to try meddling in his affairs
now he can let the police have
something for their dogs
a glove or a shoe
it a hell of a time afterwards but---
mmm i should have told him
before as soon as i knew
as a friend it was generous of
you to try and shield him
generous
yes im always generous to my friends
do you have a cigarette
here
officially it my job to tell him
but he a catholic isnt he
steven exhales loudly
what the difference
well perhaps father maguire could do it
im not trying to get out of it
but father maguire could
give him strength---
ill tell him myself
and the dogs can have their glove
it not only that
by god it not
let me get hold of father maguire
damn father maguire
well i expect youll be going home shortly mrs monks
tonight
oh as soon as that
pulled a bit of rank doctor wife
in capable hands
and does he know the glad news
not yet
think he wants me there
he said so
arent you sure
yes
just saying it aloud i suppose
like looking at a present again
do you mind being out here
ive been shut up for so long
well you deserve your happiness i must say
i dont think so
i was a dreary wife
father maguire gives a little laugh
being a doctor wife
isnt easy
oh i ran things competently if
that what you mean
i didnt wink at the man next door
it not important really
well some people think it is
you mean people like clifford
they didnt have a chance those two
why is he so surprised that ruth
does those things
poor clifford he so good yet so naive
his very perfection alone must have driven her away
well it could have inspired her instead couldnt it
she wanted to be treated as a human
he tried to make a saint out of her
and do you think he should justify
her infidelity by calling it human
not justify try to understand and then help
and would you condone infidelity
in your own marriage partner
on the same grounds
of human weakness
is that sister durrell please
no it nurse monks
oh im sorry were looking for sister durrell
hey are you allowed to be out
coming in right away
well i mustnt keep you
your question wasnt very subtle father
it stuck out like a sore thumb
ruth told me about it one night
she was rather tight
she didnt actually say it happened
but i knew
the whole thing meant nothing to her
it was just an incident
yes but it was more than an incident
to you wasnt it
oh at the time yes it was a shock to my
ego and an affront to my dignity
then all this
the long hours lying in bed
trying to make sense of the news
that i wasnt going to die
and then suddenly everything came into focus
that if hed really wanted ruth instead of me
he would have gone to her
ive had nine years with steven
most of them happy ruth has had an affair
i must go now
yes yes
well i told you this father maguire
because it worried you
you think broadly for a woman
have you known many women father
mmm are you taking the confessional
im sorry
i dont understand
it not bradley wife
it ruth
you mean it was ruth at that hotel
with bradley ruth
yes
staying with him at the hotel
yes
no
not ruth
not ruth
then it all gone
everything
all gone
well find her soon
how long have you known
since i brought bradley in
well why didnt you tell me before
i should have
why didnt you
why
you couldnt have done anything clifford
except go and look for her
ive been to look for her every day
once in the night after the police had gone
why didnt you tell me
you couldnt have done anything clifford
he never talked about his wife
we wondered about that
she meant nothing to him
but did he know who i was did he
no i dont think so
what have i done
why couldnt i help her more
nobody could help her
she said once she came to tap my virtues
wasnt it an odd way of putting it steven
to tap my virtues
well i knew what she meant
i was so sure i could help her
she took our faith and for a time---
does father maguire know
no
he would have told you himself
you look tired steven
you people outside are working
harder than we are
she met him
by chance clifford
yes
it wouldnt have happened if---
yes yes it would
she ruth
im sorry for bradley
why must you always
pity the people who---
you dont understand do you
not pity them
how can you not pity them
do these things make them happy
was she happy with you
no
im afraid the police will want to
publish a photograph of her
and you might let them have something of hers
for the dogs to get a scent from
therell be a lot of morbid interest im afraid
you may decide not to help them
not help them to find ruth
it wont be very easy for you
you dont really think the scandal worries me
then you must get in touch with them
thank you for coming to tell me
im sorry it was so difficult for you but
you see it was shock
post-operative shock
clifford breaks down crying
sorry i had no idea
steven
julie
is that julie in there
what other nurse calls you steven
im obviously at the wrong session
seven to eight woman hour
that what the board said
that board right
i wasnt thinking
are you going right through
i mean to the clean room
are you going home
i should never have left in the first place
it was cowardly of me letting you cope
like that please forgive me
forgive you
forgive you
you see martyrs sometimes follow the wrong cause
julie when they first brought you here and i
thought you were going to die---
that past steve
there was so much i wanted to say but i
panicked and---
well thank you and goodnight
yes you out
may i say in my defence---
you can say it to matron
telephone ringing
if youre not out of---
sorry doctor
no youre absolutely right
and thatll be matron agreeing with you
come on
get your clothes on
and let the men have a go
auxiliary on the phone
yes just a moment please
a call for you doctor
right
what will he think of me
yes doctor monks here
hello steven
i just wanted to talk to someone
ruth
ruth on telephone
yes
well where are you
ruth on telephone
it doesnt matter steven
julie
but it does matter ruth
ive got to talk to you

brad
bang and crash as ruth falls
down the stairs
ruth
police car bells ringing
what happened
it was well alight when i got here
were they able to---
no
the trouble is
it been boarded up
they thought it was empty
solemn music starts playing
at least it the way she chose
im sorry for clifford
there was a time when you couldnt
feel anything for clifford
that was a long while ago
not so long
it was before i heard you were
going to be all right
all new things began from there
were going to be all right arent we steve
yes
were going to be all right
hopeful music end theme

your mother
oh she ran off
when i was a child
i couldnt even

in your case that
a wasteful philosophy
never trust
flattery

we ought to keep
an eye on the tide
it three o’clock
the steamer leaves

the bane
of father life

to the village market
for this

sent some to you
i lose my sense of humor
sometimes
ha
well i shall miss this place

a while yet i hope
yes yes
im off in the morning
but you--youve
only just arrived
besides you fit in
so well here heh
well it very kind
of you to say so

miss bentley

i tell you what though
as a peace offering

the great honor
of dining with me

buona sera
miss bentley

ahhhhhh
youll like it
penny
shilling then

im afraid so

that the business
doesnt run itself better
when im away
perhaps you like to feel
youre needed
well it only recently
that ive allowed myself
to leave it at all
cant you stay
a little longer
no ive made my plans
and i must
stick to them
dont um
dont you have any reason
for going back
to england
none whatsoever
tell me
were you never married
no uh yes
i wouldve been
but he already had
a wife
fourteen years
that went on
became such a habit
that when she died
well i suppose
he couldnt face--
anyway i never
saw him again
were you
ever married
before the war i was
engaged to be married
but by the time
it was all over
that had changed
one lost a lot of friends
in the war
and uh
i found it hard
to make attachments
after that
it seems weve both
been unlucky in love
mm
perhaps we should stick
to tennis
major
your carriage awaits
good gracious me
what on earth going on
oh i couldnt let
my friend go in a taxi
no no no no no
ha ha
today it will be
my pleasure
to take you
to the station myself

it a long way
you will be doing me
a favor
my family this morning

unconquerable desires

dead in your tracks

that life has
a predetermined pattern

no not really
i have my own business
you see
industrial engineering
light metal and so forth
no it more or less
runs itself nowadays
i assumed
you were in the army
yes sappers--
long time ago

stay a whole month
at least until another
impulse strikes you
well
yeah well see

to see me
that trick
already in danger
of becoming stale
know what you said when
i left this morning--
that we should get to know

surprising in you

quite understandably
as it turned out
with these political
shenanigans going on
you mightve been
hurt you know

and then they seal it up
put it back in the envelope
but for the trick
to work
i really need

awfully like cheating
well just think of it
as a game--
something
for the children

mm-hmm
i thought you said

i did
but i changed my mind
ah
ah mmm
ah
ah
oh oh
oh oh
damn
oop
ahem
we must go home now
oh oh
this is
the bbc world service
from london
the time is six o’clock
today
winston churchill mp
had a private meeting
with von ribbentrop
the foreign minister
of germany
to discuss a case for
an anglo-german alliance
in which germany
would stand guard
for the british empire
in exchange
germany requested
the return
of her colonies
and that britain
grant her a free hand
in eastern europe
it was clearly indicated
by churchill
that the british government
would not concede
to such terms
great britain would never
disinterest herself
in the fortunes
of the continent
to an extent
which would enable germany
to gain domination
of central and eastern europe
von ribbentrop replied
the fuhrer is resolved
that nothing will stop him
and that war
is inevitable
may i join you
yes
that looks rather good
ill have one of those
too please
you go ahead please
the sun really quite warm
when you consider
that it only may
mmm
yes it really been
exceptionally warm
all month
yes ive heard even
the italians say
it has been
exceptionally warm
it awfully
quiet here
without
the bonizzonis
mm yes very cheerful
werent they
mmm
you were saying
no i was
only going to say
you seem to have
got up rather early
were you thinking
of going for a swim
no i was thinking of going
up into the mountains again
apparently there a bus
that takes you
most of the way
dont suppose
youd care to come
i really ought
to do my packing
well it shouldnt
take too long
we could be back
by three o’clock
oh i cant
ive simply got
too much to do
well youve got until tomorrow
what time your train
well and then
there another thing
i really ought to get
my sleeper ticket
ive got an open one
i shouldve got it
yesterday
oh very well
i expect youd rather say
good-bye to como anyway
maggiore
good god

your ears have gone
bright red
well
ill tell you what
if you dont stay
for a month
i shall chuck you
in the lake

-----NewMovie-----
﻿
my mommy always said
there were no monsters
no real ones
but there are
weve seen
no additional defects
she perfect
mm-hmm
careful
two centimeters
okay
yeah
ready with that amnio
oh
and
there it is
no
be careful
jesus
clamp
what about her
can we keep her alive
how the host
doing well
sew her back up
excellent work everybody
and how is
our number 8 today
appears to be
in good health
hmm
how good
excellent
as in completely off
our projected charts
look at the scar tissue
see the recession
this is from three days ago
exactly
oh this is good
this is very good
youre gonna make us all
very proud
no
dont im all right
now try this
hand
close
glove
number 8
fruit
good cherries
it unprecedented
totally
she operating
at a completely adult capacity
what about her memories
there are gaps
and some degree ofsynaptic dissonance
you know this
she freaked
come on
it has connective difficulties
caused by a biochemical imbalance
causing emotional autism
certain reactions—
all right
wait a second
it has memories
why does it have memories
well im guessing but
inherited memories
passed down generationally
at a genetic level
by the aliens like its strength
plus a uh
highly evolved form of instinct
an unexpected benefit
from the genetic crossing
oh ho ho ho ho
i see
stupid me
ofcourse
an unexpected benefit
ofthe genetic process
oh and i didnt
even think ofthat
let try this one
ripley
ripley
ripley what is it
ripley ripley
youre not thinking
termination
oh boy
am i thinking termination
general
we do not perceive this
to be a problem
ellen ripley died trying to
wipe this species out
for all intents and purposes
she succeeded
im not anxious to see her
taking up her old hobbies
that wont happen
we wont tell her
oh i see
and that supposed
to comfort me
identification please
please try again
thankyou general perez
bottom line is
she looks at me funny
one time
im putting her down
okay as far as im concerned
number 8
is a meat by-product
her majesty here
is the real payoff
when does she start producing
days
less maybe

make any difference
youre still gonna die

the devil enters the body of
the person he wants to control
uses the organs of that body
for his own pleasure
and performs feats
far above the capacity strength
and ability of
the person thus possessed
here in the holy book
for the knowledge of mankind
since the days of our lord and even
before satan and the other demons
have persecuted the souls of christians
they make no distinction
between men women and children
he the devil
uses the bodies of others as his own
destroying those he wants to dominate
perverting their language
and distorting their lips
froth exits their mouths
rather than words
lead a virtuous life and place
yourselves in the hands of our lord
you must live within
the rules of our religion
the only true religion
otherwise
the devil will find
a place inside our bodies
and take our souls away
and then
we shall burn in hell forever
throughout eternity
your souls will find no rest
your bodies will suffer eternal torture
the wrath of satan has no mercy
repent
oh god please help me
i dont want to burn in hell
calm down
justine what wrong
answer me
are you feeling better now
what happened
i dont know
she shouldnt be left alone
she should rest for a while
i can look after her
please dont leave me alone
i can stay with her
would you like to stay alucarda
alright
well leave her in your care alucarda
if you need anything i wont be far
monsters monsters
they have done this to you
justine dont tell of our secret
i hear voices
voices from the past
the same dark voices
they were soft at first
i was looking at the trees
and the voices began to speak to me
coming from the forest
i can hear them clearly justine
only you and me
only you and me justine
my god im so scared
we will make them pay bit by bit
for all they have taken away from us
alucarda

dont abandon her lord
please keep her from harm
today we will continue studying
the teachings of saint theresa
and this is what the devil does
to beget his evil
he obtains help from our virtues
even if the gain is small
his harvest is great
but god in his infinite wisdom
understands the wiles of the devil
and so gives us the strength
to face them with noble thoughts
and prayer
in this way
i trust that you have been listening
yes sister
then you can repeat
what i have just read
well alucarda
stand up child
and this is what the devil does
he grants us virtues
to expand his kingdom
the only valid one
god with his lack of knowledge
does not understand this truth
and opposes it with
false thoughts and prayers
god silence
i renounce the other god
and all the saints
dont listen dont listen to them
lord and master
dont listen go out of the room
go go go
i promise to do all that is evil
i will declare you name to all and will
not cease to serve the lord of darkness
my body my soul
and my life belong to you
call the mother superior quickly
what wrong with you girls
god help up please
please stop it
alucarda my child

this is blasphemy god help me
how dare you blaspheme
are you mad
have you taken leave of your senses
answer me answer me
i only repeated what you said
god forgive you
you have just invoked the
kingdom of darkness
and rejected the infinite wisdom of god
and now you deny it
and alucarda too
liars repent
here in front of the cross
beg ask for forgiveness
sister germana
reverend mother thank god youre here
i have to inform you of the strange
and blasphemous behaviour of these girls
mother in front of me
sister mary and all the pupils
justine and alucarda
denied the lord our christ
they used the most evil language to
recognise satan as their lord and master
i cant believe it
but it true
what have you to say for yourself
sister mary
send for the doctor
perhaps they are ill
father lazarus will be here soon
i want them both
to be prepared for confession
go hurry now

how long has she been like this
since this morning
but she has got much worse
her pulse is faint
her heart is weak
this girl is very sick

pray for the sake of your soul
pray pray justine pray
what is it girl
what the matter
easy girl easy
it is your turn now alucarda
yes my child
i i
yes go on
i was told to come to you
speak up then
i was asked to answer a question
and i did
and sister germana is angry with me
and for a very good reason
i am not what you may think father
the facts were
explained to me my child
you have sinned
i dont recall doing anything wrong
liars rot in hell for eternity
i know for sure
that you are doing wrong
dont miss this opportunity
which has been granted you
you can tell the truth
here and now
perhaps i have done wrong
i couldnt have lied
i love life with
with
go on
justine
is a close friend of mine
i love her
you call yourself blessed and
believe in eternal life and worship god
i worship life you worship death
i love justine
you love to kill
we have made a pact
and sealed it with our blood
justine and i
the fault isnt ours but yours
you cover your body with a black cassock
as if you are ashamed of it
but youd like to
possess me wouldnt you
take me
take off your cassock
what happened father
what happened
please sister get her out of here
my god no no
all we can do is wait
well know better tomorrow
i hope shell recover
im convinced she will
with the help of the lord
the things she said were so horrible
please lord do not abandon us
in such times of difficulty
you did not hear what she said
it was the devil
as if the devil himself
was speaking through her mouth
these words cannot come from
anyone else only the devil
the devil
the devil
father lazarus
do you really believe that because
we belong to the church
we are safe from the devil influence
i remember when i visited
the archives at the vatican
i read many incidents
that had been confirmed
incidents like this
in 49 at the monastery of cameron
some nuns became immensely strong
they barked like dogs
and predicted the future
they contaminated
the rest of the community
and made the monastery
a temple of the devil
in 550 the nuns
of the convent of nazareth
became possessed
they climbed trees like cats
and levitated for hours
in 555 in rome itself
in an orphanage just like this one
three orphans were responsible
for horrible things
which could only be the work
of a diabolical mind
two of them became seriously ill
and the third finally died
killing all three
justine and alucarda may be possessed
mother
the devil is elsewhere
not in those poor girls
it looks like we are
the victims of a conspiracy
justine and alucarda
are possessed by the devil
it not surprising that satan
has chosen these delicate creatures
his plans are directed against
the holy church and its representatives
they may not be possessed
by the devil himself
but at least by
one of his evil messengers
what are we going to do
we must pray that god can help us
jesus christ
deliver us from this nightmare
dont let them
possess us
how long has justine been like this
almost a week
and then she became ill
she fainted during the hymns
and said the light affected her
that it
a heliophobic demon
a sixth category devil
who hates light
he acts at night when
the shadows protect him
we must destroy him
in order to free the girls
we must prepare
an exorcism
justine poor justine
i wont let them harm you
i wont let them take you away
ill take you somewhere
where you can be safe
my poor justine
youve got to help me
no
you must get up
sister what dyou think youre doing
open the door
come child
do not despair my child
we are here to deliver you from evil
it not the child but
the demon inside her that resisting
i shall prove this by
exposing la marca diaboli
the devil mark she has on her skin
the mark of the devil
remove her clothing
god of heaven jesus christ
die soon
die soon
this is all the evidence i need
you have all seen her
they cannot stand the name
of our saviour they are possessed
youll die soon
silence her
i order thee evil spirit
in the name of the one who judges
the one who has created
and can destroy the world
the one who has the power
to send you to hell
go depart
leave the bodies of
these two servants of god
they must return to the holy church
by the power of my faith
and of the holy ghost
i demand that you
return to your bottomless pit
humble yourself at the feet of christ
because his faith is greater than yours
christ before whom you tremble
christ who takes lost souls from the
fires of hell to the light of heaven
now depart
back where you belong evil spirit
god commands you
do not resist
god the father commands you
god the son commands you
god the holy ghost commands you
the holy cross commands you
the faith of st peter
and st paul commands you
all the saints command you
the holy cross commands you
all the faithful command you
depart seducer enemy of virtue
stop it
stop it i say
stop it
doctor how dare you
interrupt our holy ritual
holy ritual this is the most
shameful thing i have ever witnessed
this is not the fifteenth century
i thought reason
had replaced superstition
this is not an act of faith
this is the most primitive expression
of ignorance i have ever seen
you
you
you have just killed justine
how dare you
damn you damn you
release her
im taking this girl with me before
you kill her as you killed justine
my lord
oh my christ
you were witness
how did this happen
where is the love he spoke of mother
to cleanse her spirit
you have destroyed her body
but the lord will not abandon her soul
because it is pure
may he have mercy on you
for all that you have done
enough sister
yes who is it
open the door please
doctor what happened
she been hurt we must care for her
how is she doctor
she alright bring the stethoscope
it alright
dont touch me
nobody wants to hurt you
everything alright
father
im scared
is anything wrong
it alucarda
she had a nightmare
dont be scared darling
she just had a nightmare
who is she
dont be afraid
dont be afraid
it only me
daniela
you just had a bad dream
youre safe with us
try to rest now
can i stay with her
for a little while father
yes darling but not too long
ill be downstairs if you need me
your father want to frighten me
he doesnt alucarda
you were dreaming
im afraid of dreams
the things i see are so real
my father is a good doctor
hell cure you
have we ever met before
i dont think so
because
i do remember people voices
you are very pretty
and you are beautiful
please dont go
stay with me
rubbish pure rubbish
who is it
it me doctor felipe
something terrible has happened
at the convent
youve got to come
but it five in the morning
the reverend mother sent me
you are to come right away
im familiar with the terrible things
at the convent what is it now
she didnt say
only that you had to come
ill be right down
thank god youve come dr hasley
justine shroud
who did this
that what we would like to know
she was brought here
to be prepared for burial
she was here all night
until a few hours ago
who was with her
sister veronica
where is she now
we dont know doctor
the least you should have done
was to say with her yourself
doctor
doctor please
no one in the convent
has been sleeping since justine died
we have been flagellating ourselves
as we flagellated justine
then someone took justine body
there no other explanation
i must notify the authorities
no theyll want to know how she died
our religious community the scandal
dont worry
the death certificate will say justine
died of an unforeseen accident
which is partly true
doctor mother superior doctor
come quickly
oh my god
she been burned to death
it looks as if
the fires of hell have reached her
take her to the chapel
i want to look at the corpse again
ill go with you
no
i want to examine it alone
if you dont mind
take her to her cell
father what is the meaning of this
this nun was dead and yet
she moved
the devil moved her limbs
she was dead
but the forces of evil
had not abandoned her
how can you explain this
from a scientific point of view
it happened is happening
in front of your very eyes
do you still doubt
i dont know
youre the only one here
who has the answer
these are the doings
of the transgressor
the seducer the enemy of virtue
the perpetual persecutor of innocence
the arch enemy of almighty god
you mean the devil
the devil
i still cant believe it
and yet this destruction was by someone
who hates all religious manifestation
to that being this chapel
was a terrible antagonist
when i studied at the university
of paris i was taught
that demonic possession
was pure nonsense
or the sad result of
the workings of an insane mind
they taught me that religion
was a farce and a form of slavery
that the time has come to
break the chains of superstition
im a man of reason
and im faced with
something supernatural
which frightens me
this woman was dead
yet there was evil inside her ready
to come alive and attack the innocent
this could only be as you say
the work of what you call the devil
yes it was the devil
who entered our sister body
and turned her from the altar of the
almighty to the fires of hell
someone must have contaminated her
justine
and we must find her
before there are more victims
more corpses more possessed
yes we must find justine
or what is left of her
you wont believe how things were
but that why we exorcised
justine and alucarda
they were possessed by the devil
is that why alucarda
was at the ceremony
her behaviour was evil diabolical
oh my god no daniela
doctor
danielas alone with her
daniela
thank you father
mother superior daniela gone
i understand
we must find them immediately
or daniela also will be possessed
well all search for them
thank you mother
are you ready doctor
yes father
we must find alucarda
where should we start looking
i think i could help find her
how would you know sister angelica
i remember some of the places
they used to go together
let go then
promise me you wont hurt her
please doctor
dont worry
this way doctor
mother superior
please bring father lazarus
yes doctor
sister theresa where your cross
ive lost it
thank you sister
doctor
they used to come here
there seems to be another way out
come on brother felipe
please no
justine

the last place we would look for her

then let em get a good look
colonel
thatll do
get some people on it
sir he may have run us around today
but the ambush--
we took three casualties
today lieutenant
we lost our scout
two american boys
only killed five
of the enemy
we let the monkeys get away with those numbers
and theyll never give up
i have to live
with these people
no lieutenant
you gotta make war on these people
you let the bleeding hearts sort
out the rest when were gone
no no no
it is no it is no
it says no
and it is confused
and it says no
no no no hobo
no hobo hobo
im thinking the same thing
i could get home
but you have to get me
out of here
i can--i can move up
you can move me up
how you doin son
i cant feel nothin
below my belt
well you took one
in the hip
it came out clean
but
it must have nicked
your spine on its way
take it all the way up
take it all the way up
will you make him
shut up
fellas say that youve been
to a hanging corporal
back home
we strung up a nigger
that stabbed a white man
you do the honors then
anything back from manila
i sent a line-check
to santa ana first thing
everything clear
stay with it
if colonel hardacre
finds out--
he wont find out will he
the amigo did lead us
into an ambush sir
maybe
they cant beat us
i dont know
why they even bother
it their country sir
lieutenant i must inform you
that i must leave this place
above all things
i am a spaniard
living under the rule
of others--
before you leave
throw on your ceremonial gear
and do what youre supposed
to for the amigo
this one head man now
tell him to watch his step
i thought id
catch you sleeping
and i thought youd be back
in the states by now
oh they say im cured
cured from the clap
that a bigger long shot
than us catching aguinaldo
youre shittin me
it just came in
on the wire from manila
they nailed aggy
hot damn
ho ho ho
yeah and he asked our little
brown brothers to give up the game
macarthur ordered
general amnesty
lettin prisoners
go left and right
any insurrecto that wants
to throw in the towel
gets 30 pesos mexican
for his rifle
they can have mine
we gotta celebrate
here we go
champagne glass
right here
oh yeah
i stretched a couple apaches back in the territory
they consider it a
particularly
ignoble death
it makes an impression
on the others
with this bunch
who knows
all right
let get this show on the road
military necessity admits
of all direct destruction
of life or limb
of armed enemies however
men who take up arms
against one another
do not cease
to be moral beings
responsible to one another
and to god
war admits of deception
but disclaims acts of perfidy
and as civil officers of
the hostile occupied country
owe strict obedience
to the victorious government
at peril of their lives
it has been judged
that rafael dacanay
head man of
the barrio of san isidro
shall hang by the neck
until he is dead
you think
this is a shithole
you ought to see
san isidro
they had a smoker
the other day
was anyone killed
a couple on both sides
you know who got it
they didnt send names
there some googoo
theyre gonna stretch
course then this message came in--
damn id better send
along the happy news
well that what i call
cuttin it close
aah
i was just part
of the crowd sir
i didnt tie the rope
sign or make your mark
right here
yeah all right
give him some money
come on
sign or make your mark
right here
this thing can still shoot
well then this is
your lucky day amigo

he wants alice at the wedding
and she has her therapist

it was a different time lynn
it was during the depression
a lot of people shot themselves
you know i wasnt
crazy about sweden
i mean it was
it was freezing
really even in june
yeah you know maybe it was
just my preconceived
notions of sweden
pro probably
it probably just
psychosomatic
i have anxiety
careful
im on medication
well we all know that
limited spectrum of our
intellect and what we are
our ancestors struggled
and fought and died
oh no fucking way
it gonna be weird like
meeting mom ex-husband

well what he look like
kind of generic

okay sorry
hello lynn im dr stanwyck
it nice to meet you
come on in
thanks
hello lynn
hey
you look great
thank you
hi lynn
hi i didnt realize that
of course dont be silly
why wouldnt i be here
you did say that this
was a family crisis
yeah i told paul
it was pressing
exactly
let all sit down
so as lynn explained
to me over the phone
your son dylan
our son our son
right right i understand
dylan and alice are the
children you and paul had lynn
now dylan has asked alice
to be the maid of honor
at his wedding sunday
is that right so far
yes
that right that right
and um alice
it not a very easy time
for her right now
so i was thinking that
itd be a good idea
if paul and i could um
talk through some issues
before she came down on friday
daddy
daddy
where are you
how is any of this my fault
i havent seen or spoken
to my daughter in 7 years
and i have no clue as to why
it not what i wanted
no it what alice wanted
is that really what alice wanted
or is that what you wanted
you havent made any effort
to make it any better over last 7 years
if that even the truth
then i will ask alice
to explain it to me
because i wanna start
resolving this once and for all
and put it behind us
no that is exactly what im
trying to get you not to do
lynn
not speak with his daughter
is this some sort of scheme
to get me down here to tell me
that i cant speak to my own
daughter at my son wedding
maybe this isnt for you
to decide anymore
maybe that what
youre afraid of
i mean alice is old enough
to decide herself
that right
this is between me
and alice lynn
it doesnt concern you
patty seriously
this has absolutely nothing
to do with you
i think this has everything
to do with me
i am her stepmother
how could you be her stepmother
when she doesnt even
consider him her father
well he is
no he isnt
yes he is
yes i am
no youre not
being a father entails
certain responsibilities
yeah so does being a mother
okay everybody look
i understand this is an
emotionally charged issue
but let try to stay
on course here
i dont think lynn means to say
that what alice is going through
is your fault paul
fine
but i should be able
to talk to my daughter
yes you should
about whatever
going on in her life
if my daughter is going through
some sort of self-destructive
phase then i want to he
wait what what
you think this is a phase
that not what he said
that exactly what he said
it not what he meant
im just trying
to protect my daughter
from who
from what
from you
what did he
i just explained it to you
you just so enjoy trying
to tear this family apart
isnt that what
this is all about
so that his story now
is that the story you tell
everybody paul
that i wanted to leave
alone with my daughter
and not raise my son
is that what you told her when
you were crying on her shoulder
did you leave out the part
where you said go lynn go
go and take alice
but if you take dylan
ill take both your kids
what else did you leave out
all i know is that
i love my daughter
and apparently
she doesnt know that lynn
and i dont understand it
i dont understand that
i dont give a fuck
what you understand
because what i know
is that my daughter
has been silently slicing
at her arms and legs
with a straight-edged
razor for six years
a straight-edged razor
now what dont you understand
you solipsistic fuck
daddy
daddy
scared
daddy
oh daddy oh my god
daddy
what the hell are
you doing out here
dont say that word
third time in a month
i just cant take it anymore
are you filming this
um
oh
youre treating me
like an animal
well that what going on
it either this daddy
or the old folks home
you make the choice okay
okay boys lift it
im not an animal
she running a little late
i hope youre ready because
we have so much planned
brandon how you doing buddy
heather looks beautiful
she lost a lot of weight
yeah she looks great
i saw paul today
dad told me howd it go
oh it went very well
i think were really
making progress
yeah really
well doesnt he look wonderful
how long has it been
since youve seen him
six months
four months
six months well
im glad that at least you have
this little bit of time
to spend with your mother
shit
patty keeps asking me if im
gonna walk her to her seat
oh absolutely
i understand completely
are you kidding me
youre my mother
ugh i bet she has something
ridiculous like a vibrator
on the bed or something
ridiculous she disgusting
listen listen
so i open the bathroom door
and i find elliot in the buff

oh my bad my bad
not cool
yo whered that
nigga elliot go
it just so scary
doesnt it scare you
are you even aware of it
when it happening
yeah but it like
it like this
switch gets flipped
and something snaps
inside of me and l
and
well where does it come from
because your reactions
to things are so extreme
it just not normal
it like
the moment i get here
im forced to lie
lie about being
in fucking sweden
and you know
trying to hide the fact
that i have fucking issues
so you cant
you cant escape
i know
like they only see you
in these stages
these intermittent
stages of your life
which are usually embarrassing
because growing up
fucking sucks
they just cling on to them
and bring them up
whenever youre around
that because
that all they have
they dont know you elliot
so it just like the only
thing that ties us together
are these horrible fucking
moments of our lives
i mean shit you wish had
never happened
it like everything
youre trying to avoid
you dont want alice
to come here
and deal with all the traumatic
shit of her childhood
and youre trying
to explain to them
that this could be really
fucking detrimental
but they dont understand
they never will
so you drive yourself crazy
alice cuts herself and i just
turn into fucking glenn beck
so
are you gonna tell
dad about this
yeah i have to
it exactly where
it supposed to be
im lynn hellman
uh hi foreman fred
may i help you with anything
well not unless
you have a solution
on how to get a twelve foot
stake into the ground
without damaging
the irrigation system
did you just wake up
no
you know i was just thinking
that maybe the tent
wasnt in the right position
that maybe if we move it
and if you face it this way
we lynn um spent a lot of
time with dylan and heather
going over all this
im sure they wouldve
appreciated your input
about a month ago
but irregardless
i think that fred and ive
got it covered dont we
we certainly do
of course i have taken
orders from this little lady
for how many years
5 years
oh jesus
am i getting old
you on the other hand
you havent aged a day
well you know im not gonna
ever let you see me
without my full fluff and fold
and a mighty fine
fluff and fold it is
oh you you are a sweetheart
youre gonna get me
in trouble with paul
i think this pollen
is giving me a migraine now
im just gonna go inside
go inside
well ill make sure
and share your thoughts
with heather and dylan
i know theyll appreciate it
donna donna
donna
like that hat donna
thank you thank you
i can not the way she just
waltzed on to our property
somebody had to help
heather with the wedding
her mother has lupus
it not lupus
she says it lupus
it chronic fatigue
we all know what that about
whatever it is
she cant help at all
it just so sad poor heather
paul company put up
the entire tent for free
saved her family a fortune
all that flirting is so
inappropriate
and that and that
that tarzan outfit
lynn youre wearing a robe
i just woke up
oh
i had a horrible night sleep
dont get defensive
no one cares
no one cares
do you think alice
like might wanna kill herself
no of course not
but like one day
do you think shell
no ben no
she gonna be fine
i guess
no totally
all right
i was wondering
do you think autistic
people know theyre autistic
i think it depends
on how severe it is
but in most cases i imagine so
yeah because
i know i was diagnosed with
like mild asperger syndrome
but i didnt think
i was autistic
no youre definitely not
why did someone say that
yeah
donna was talking about
it to bonnie and grandma
with you in the room
yeah but they were whispering
they didnt know i could hear
but ive got like
amazing hearing
i mean like i could
hear shit below 20 hertz
i just dont understand
why you have to redesign
the whole dress
im just putting
sleeves on it mom
it not that big a deal
maybe not to you
what that supposed to mean
all im saying is that
i think that alice
would like to fit in
with the rest of the party
rather than standing out
like a sore thumb
okay you know what
this is not up for debate
now dont get all
huffy and puffy
im not getting
all huffy and puffy
now youre in a state
am i right
hello oh hi paul
oh it fantastic
were all so
excited around here
yeah right
joe he
he getting weaker
yeah he keeps
i once saw this pbs special with
all these great doo-wop singers
donna please shhh
what oh paul
shell be on the phone
for at least 20 minutes
they do this every couple
i know that
yeah that lynn
i know oh yeah
that right oooh when
i could just about
kill you right now
in that case
youll have to pop inside
ill make you a cup of coffee
good all right
well then ill see the two of
you real soon huh
okay paul say hello
to the girls for me
yeah bye-bye
mom
mmm
mom what did you just do
what
did you just invite them over
oh good lord
are you pretending
to be oblivious
or do you really not get it
get what
how that might make me feel
suddenly
there was such a racket
seems like every guy on the ship
was yelling his head off
so i got out of the room
i ran up the stairs
all the way up to the top deck
to see what was going on
and there a woman
standing there
so i look over and im looking
and all of a sudden i realize
that doris
standing there waiting for me
granddad
dude did he just die on camera
it okay
you dont joke about that
look im sorry
i didnt i didnt mean to
cause any sort of
false alarm dont worry
what happened
he did look dead though
he looked like really dead
did something happen to dad
no
yeah something did happen
no nothing happened
something happened
we thought he was dead
elliot
we have it on camera
what did you do to him elliot
what did i do nothing mom
whatre you doing
with that camera
okay he was telling a story
about world war ii and
you brought up politics
no i didnt bring up politics
for fuck sake
elliot
oh you guys have never
heard the fuck word before
okay elliot
just go to your room
mom im not six years old
and i dont have a room
this isnt my house
last i heard
your name was on
the fucking title
oh oh oh
you are a real asshole
oh oh im sorry
you know that
i wasnt supposed to say it
ok just get out
get out
yeah im on my way
hey arent you
eat shit paul
some manners that kid has
oh fuck you paul
im sorry i apologize
im sorry
um would anyone
like some tea or coffee
pass those would you dear
paul wants some
oh they look delicious
wait till you all see alice
oh god what a beauty
and she just
as smart as a whip
really quick yeah
really looking forward to having
a conversation with her
although lynn doesnt think
it such a good idea
i didnt say that paul
good im glad there
no problem then
im just trying to make sure
alice doesnt walk into
a um emotionally
volatile atmosphere
it a wedding lynn
weddings arent volatile
you know paul i dont think
you really understand
just how fragile
alice is right now
and it not your fault
at all
you see the psychology
of self-injuring
is very complicated
and i think what
alice is was doing
in her case is she was
trying to convert
her emotional pain
into something tangible
like a physical pain
i i think we do understand
usually this kind of thing is
about seeking attention
what did i say
something stupid
okay patty could i just
no
it has become a fad these days
it not a fad
i think that
i dont care what you think
i am just trying
to explain to you
what going on
with our daughter
and i think in her case
it about her trying
to gain control
over what
over everything
everything in this
child entire life
has been beyond her control
our divorce
the fact that she was forced
to spend summers with you
the fact that she grew up
without her brother
all of it she had no
control over any of it
but you did
no mom i didnt
paul tell me if im crazy
because i really dont remember
anymore i really dont
i mean i blocked
so much of it out
that i dont know what
true and what not
the night before i left
we were in the kitchen
and you were screaming at me
about something l
i think you
i think you lost your
keys or something
and alice was
holding on to my leg
and you were screaming
you were really screaming
and she was terrified
she wouldnt let go
and then you grabbed me
by my shirt
and you punched me in the face
you grabbed me by my shirt
and you punched me
right in the face
now tell me paul
did that actually happen
yeah it happened
it must feel good
to get something like
that off your chest
hey granddad
have you seen my camera
nope
oh there it is
last night
i didnt sleep as usual
i got to thinking
maybe around like 4 am or so
that you know
it seems like there been
an inordinate amount
of drama since we got here
and it made me think that
if we come down here
for a funeral
instead of a wedding
we might actually all
be getting along
now begs the question
what does that mean
and the only conclusion
ive been able to come to
is that death is actually
a more unifying force
within family than love
that a mind blowing concept
it is a despicable thing to say
really
really
i mean i know this sounds
kind of cynical but
i mean take 9/ for instance
i know i was young
when it happened
but honestly
when i think about it
it may have been the only time
in my entire life
that i ever really
truly felt connected
to every single member
of my family
like some strange
intangible nexus
just unveiled itself
for a moment
i know it still there
that not what im saying
i guess i just think it
weird that it takes tragedy
to bring it out
well l perhaps it just
the way you were brought up
mmm
i am myself
and my circumstances
did you hear about alice
yeah i feel bad for her
supposedly it bad
it such a bizarre
thing to do to yourself
i dont get it
now theyre gonna sew
sleeves on her dress
she so gruesome
lynn says it this
generation anorexia
anorexia i can understand
everybody wants to look good
but this is just gross
it is
you dont do it do you
any of your friends do it
no of course not
see so it not
generational donna
i didnt say it lynn said it
i just hope she looks nice
well it may not matter
why what do you got
lynn said something about
not wanting to bring alice
into this environment
how could she do
such a thing you know
do what
alice isnt coming
to the wedding
what
that is not necessarily a given
she wants everything about her
because she wants all the attention
she just like her mother
who said she not coming
donna said that lynn said it
i did not
yes you did
how could she do that
how could she just not come
i dunno
what
how could she do that
how could she not come
how can she ruin
her brother wedding
what is wrong with you
who said she not coming mom
you should just tell her
to stop all this silly drama
this isnt about her
it about heather and dylan
it their day
i know that she is coming
who said she not coming
it doesnt matter who
said it for god sakes lynn
it was said
you shouldve just told
her to call her father
and to resolve this whole thing
instead now it all ruined
oh fine
hey everybody
oh thank god
what up alice
how are you
im good
yeah mom
hi
how are you
im good im good
you look good
thank you hi
im not waiting
to give you a hug

no l i can cut it
i dont mind
donna donna please stop it
she can eat like everyone else
i bet you there someone
waiting in the wings
i think you lost
your keys or something
but you were screaming at me
and alice was holding
on to my leg
and she was terrified
she wouldnt let go
and then you grabbed me
by my shirt
shit alice im sorry
it all right
i didnt think about it
dude are you like crying
i think alice handled
the family very well
yeah she and dylan
were cracking up
about that dog in the outfit
a cowboy
i just dont know what im
supposed to do about paul

i just dont get
what the appeal is
of paul
no the cowboy dog
are you even listening to me
yeah yeah of course
i just cant get over that dog
well try lee
he had these little holsters
and
little chaps he was wearing
so im pretty sure

investigation

your thesis paper on this

heart of darkness 4
thesis papers dont
have such poetic titles
yeah
what the fuck are you doing
with drugs elliot
you got out of your fourth
rehab three months ago

and all the things
we brutalizing
not one yuppie on this family
will be my own relation
right hand up i go seven
sieg heils at hellman nation
oh shit elliot
coming all the way from mic
straight to annapolis
just to fucking kill it
in one my goodness
oh my goodness bitches
oh my god making my baby

book on my mom bed
all about the g-spot
ive been trying it out
on a few bitches
you know how i can
be totally certain
that youre full
of shit right now

because if your mom really

she wouldnt have to make
costumes for dogs
oh snap nigga

baby batter
shut the fuck up ben
hey elliot better dance

youre talking about ben
yeah i do cause mom taught
you and you taught me
you were good remember
you guys know about
my brother ben right
you know how he
has severe autism

autism to the retard too much
then he gets low self-esteem
and that not good

it would make you look
so much more attractive
oh my god she is

he fine
we have them made
for us in indiana
and really the money is
right
now the deal with gm
was for carriages
they dont look the same
cubic zirconias look the same
i know but im talking
it just a status thing
i just dont get that
it interesting
most people think that when
rock n roll first hit
boom that there
was nothing else
not true because what most
people dont remember
was that there was
this strange time
maybe three or four years
when everything sort of
coincided so that you had
you had your perry comos
and your bill haleys
and your pat boones
and you had people
like jill corey
you remember
no
yeah you do because
i played you that song
make like a bunny honey
im gonna go call granny
and check on everybody
see how they are
at the hospital
good tell them were
praying for them
hey
hey
look um
i just want to say l
i think we got off on the wrong
foot back at the house
and and all i really
wanted to convey to you
was that that i really
have missed you
that we all have missed you
your mother said that you
werent feeling good
and so i just didnt
know what to expect
well after
everything you heard
i hope i didnt disappoint you
disappoint me
no no way no no
what does that mean
sorry im just being
kind of awkward
um
dylan told me that you
gave him a big promotion
that yeah
that really great
he deserves it
yeah
done a great job but he
gotta build towards something
like youre doing
yeah thanks
i mean i had to take
some time off but um
im doubling up on courses
for september
so i can graduate on time
that good
yeah
im im so happy you
finally found something
i mean i really love it
you know i
i dont know i feel like maybe
i have something to
offer there in a way
alice i know everybody thinks
that i dont understand
everything
and maybe theyre right
but i want to i do
thanks paul
and you know if you ever
want to just phone me
or just wanna talk
maybe youre feeling
down or something
i just dont want to
lose touch with you again
if that what you want
yeah i mean id
id really like that
maybe we could um
get lunch or something
i mean um maybe it could
maybe it could
just be me and you
she my wife
alice
i know
uh excuse me barkeep
yeah
um can i get three shots
double shots
of your finest whiskey please
um how old are you
okay im 7
this is my family
and this is hell
i beg you
have some fucking sympathy
i call it my thursday list
alice is hysterical
in the parking lot
give me my purse
grab the kids i need to pee
alrighty
um do you like drink often
only really when im on opiates
okay
but like
what i was like saying
is that like my mother
really is the one who like
raised dylan not your mother
and like i dont mean that in
like an offensive way
it just like the truth
and like i guess
like what i want to say
is that like i think it
like pretty disrespectful
that like your mother
forced dylan to choose her
to walking down the aisle
mmm
so yeah
you wanna know

it 23 ante meridian
and im reporting to you
live and on the scene
outside the home
of joe and doris baker
in the heart of queen anne city
annapolis maryland
where just moments ago
the diabolical force
known as the hellman family
has finally submerged this
quaint waterfront town
into complete and utter chaos
with their overly sensitive
self-destructive daughter
alice scissorhands
and the rather unseemly
and highly inappropriate
behavior of their mama familias
some have begun to wonder
how will tomorrow
events unfold
oh wait one moment
im getting something
preliminary reports
are suggesting
that no matter the outcome
doris baker is
and will remain quietly furious
the question that begs to be
answered however is
will they unite
for just one day
or will all hell break loose and
split this family in two
like a maryland blue crab
this is elliot hellman reporting
to you live for fuck news
back over to you ben
what the name
of that tea i like
which one
the one i drink
green tea

mom can i talk to you
for a minute

why is it you have never learned
when to just keep quiet
i just wanted
i know what you want

or the respect or the
consideration
to keep anything private
im just trying
to make things better

the middle of the night

everyone must change
no one and nothing
remains the same
now the young the old
and mysteries do unfold
cause that the way of time
nothing and no one
remains the same
there are not so
many things in life
you can be sure of
whoo
except the rain
comes from the clouds
sunlight from the sky
and hummingbirds do fly
young becomes the old
and mysteries do unfold
that the way of time
nothing no one
remains unchanged
there are so little things
so few things in life
you can be sure of
except rain comes
from the clouds
sunlight from the sky
and humming birds do fly
everything changed
everything
everything must change

circumstances but
im gay myself
so i understand what
youre going through
the thing is um
aaron or brad
signed a contract which had
a morals clause
and it a very big film a
very big part of a franchise
so with this morals clause
if anything were to get out in
the press about him being
um not to the
studio liking
and let just say theyre a
very conservative studio
it could really hurt brad
he would be fired
he could be sued even
because of something like this
so i have some form for you
it a confidentiality
agreement there that
there a prepared statement
weve written for you
which basically states that
nothing happened
between the two of you
it would be really great if
you could sign these for me
um i have a pen here
if you could just sign here
and here
here as well
and here
that would be so wed
really appreciate it so much

appreciates this as well

he got a lot to think about
hi
father wanted me to talk to you he means
to keep you here for me im sorry
i do not have time for this
dont you have enough toys
he said youre sure to be killed
i wouldnt want that
saunders prepare the conjugal suite
fresh bedding everything
the gentleman will be staying then sir
he will
nanelia will convince him
im sure she will sir
the defence of his planet is hopeless
he will understand that
im sure he will sir
we will have children here saunders
noise excitement life
it will be quite a change sir
in the colder season even the grasses
in the meadows changes colour
chlorophyll content
whatever
they turn bright red yellow orange
they change shade and
wave when the wind blows
wind
yes wind
it it rather like your
ventilation system in here
you know rapid ventilation but it
different bigger than this but it wind
ive scanned all these things in our data
banks but ive never experienced them
do you know there a form in the black galaxy whose
children have no immune system till the age of five cycles
that means that at the slightest trace of
infection they would just rot like fallen fruit
i have heard of them the huddite
who asked you
when they reach the age of five cycles
all the relatives gather
together in a special room
and they watch while the child tears and bites
at his plastoid with its teeth and nails
till it breaks out in the
arms of his parents
feels their skin for the first time
feels the wetness on their
cheeks for the first time
it horrible out there forms
preying on other forms death
most of them never do develop immunities
they die shortly afterwards
but the huddite still feel that the
breaking out ceremony is very beautiful
you really want to go
back there dont you
even if it certain youll end
oh yes im going back
step into the captor grid
i must warn you miss nanelia that would
cause the captor grid to short circuit
so
come with me you know about computers
you can help us
i cant i cant leave my father
i wish i had time to stay and
convince you but it your life
such as it is
dummy
what took you so long
he wanted me to stay for dinner
and how is old doc hephaestus
well he not the man he used to be
let get out of here
come with me you can help us
no weapons at all
no but i brought an analyser we can predict
their attack modes and plan a defence
id like to exchange data with that thing
might be some new wrinkles i should catch up on
who that
it just nell
nell
ill introduce you later back on akir
wait for me in the lambda zone
our emissary has returned from umateal
they have replied to our ultimatum
and
what this
it is our emissary sir
they have powdered him
they are a proud form
in an hour theyll be an extinct one
not a trace of them left
not even their dust
think the girl will be all right
crossing through the lambda zone
well in my day that was a pretty wild area but
it probably tamed down like everything else
i suppose she a very
interesting form nell
starboard side kid weve got some action
what is it
the little ones are jackers
theyre breaking down his force shield
then what
they incinerate him and steal his load
sixteen gamblers to carry my coffin
six purty maidens to sing
and lay the sod on me
for im a poor cowboy
know i done wrong
this is space cowboy sos
mayday
help
can we help him nell
not without a fight
well
youre just lucky i havent
got any ammunition left
ive never taken life before nell
the varda says we can
take life to save life
okay nell let do it
manual controls
locking on target
fire fire
not from behind
step in it kid youve
got to follow through
no no not from behind no
hooray for our side
you fired without me
it had to be done
youre placed under my direct command
you fired without me
that which is not organic must not
harm that which is i know i know
it a damn stupid rule
jacker to port sector three
i did it
i
didnt think i just did it
you had to kid you done fine
fighting
listen ive done more fighting
than ive seen old movies
which is saying a lot seeing
that all i do on long hauls
well
i have the greatest
collection of old westerns
well need experienced soldiers
would you care to fight with us
yeah you see youre fighting sador
sador never lost a war he never quits
you fight sador youve got a
snowball chance in hell
snowball
transmission from the planet umateal
the malmori force has arrived
put it up on the screen nell
stellar converter
see what i mean
umateal
that was my customer
how would you like 0000 mach laser 4
and 40000 charge snides
theyre paid for and i havent
got the fuel to get them home
youre carrying weapons
theyre hand weapons the best we make
were going to need weapons
but we wont know how to use them
yeah
and well probably need someone
to teach us how to use them
yes i can see that
and we did save your life
okay my rig a hauler not a fighter but
ill set up your ground defences
agreed put it there
im not the cavalry
cavalry
ill show you youve got
a treat in store for you
as a matter of fact ill show
you custer last stand
yes indeed
a pretty tasty looking morsel
who are you
your saviours you were about
to be digested by a zime
a zime
a creature who consumes living organisms
were zimeirs
we cook them down for their protein
i am cayman of the lambda zone
and these are my crew
theyre burning me
theyre kelvin urim and thunim
the kelvin are a thermal creature
they communicate in degrees of heat
and this is quopeg
my kunar
well id like to thank you all very much
now just get me down
now now now dont be too grateful
i know a market where a female form like
yours would bring in some heavy dust
youd do that youd sell me
well of course live or for protein
i do whatever pays the most
im hiring mercenaries for a
great battle on the planet akir
is that so
what could this planet akir offer me
they have the richest molybdenum
deposits in the system
nice try hot blood but
ive already seen akir
and there is absolutely nothing
on that planet that i want
youre heartless youre just like sador
sador
sador sador of the malmori
it who were fighting against
quopeg
so sador lives does he
your ship will need some repair
quopeg cut the zime loose
we cruise for akir
were being pulled in by something
feels like a magnetic net look sector 2
damn it prepare full thrust
well break loose
im not strong
remember the varda
what about the varda
think what would the varda say
nell
to use greater strength against itself
it our only hope kid
all right big mouth change
course right into their laps
okay what the big idea
dont everybody talk at once
listen if i dont get some answers fast
im going to have to use this thing
let me rephrase that
you are not of a violent form
we sensed that you did not intend to shoot
you read my mind
among other things we have
monitored your travels
you are seeking mercenaries
for an adventure
we would like to participate
well we cant offer much in payment
no need we are self-sufficient
we are nestor
all of you
this is but a facet
these are but facets
there are hundreds of thousands like us at home
and scattered throughout the universe
we are nestor
youre clones
in a manner of speaking
we share identical consciousness
what one sees all see
what one knows all know
and all of you want to help us
these five facets yes
four of us are required
to operate this ship
what about the fifth
we always carry a spare
thank you
you see there is only one
nestor one consciousness
as you might imagine
this is proving very lonely
very dull we must avoid becoming
we believe you have a phrase for it
becoming bored to death
look kalo females
a bonding approved for procreation
a bonding conceived in the
face of our present crisis
were supposed to guard the planet
where is it gonna go
come on let do it
it would make you happy wouldnt it
what the hell theyre only akira
everybody scatter
beam her up kalo beam her up
in the old days nascosto was one of the
wildest cities in the smilax system
freebooters outlaws adventurers if youre
looking for mercenaries that the place
doesnt look like much of a city to me
it all under the surface
the weather is a bit touchy up on top
there are tornadoes and radiation storms every
couple of days keeps the tourists away
who sent you
im on a mission for the people of akir
im hiring mercenaries
i was told that there would
be many on nascosto
youre a little late there nothing
left but me and the lower forms
what happened here
the other planets in the galaxy
formed a protective association
they raised an army and cleaned us out
we made them nervous
but you stayed
i came back for a rest
there not a planet in the galaxy
where there isnt a bounty on my head
what makes you so popular
i settle disputes very quickly
im very good at it
i dont care who i work with
ive collected a lot of
enemies along the way
you kill for a pay
i have no home
no family no principles
what else would i kill for
pleasure
no
it strictly business with me
now what your pitch
im hiring mercenaries to
protect against an invasion
but food and shelter is all
we can offer in payment
all of our wealth is in our culture
i could buy your planet ten times over
with what ive gathered in this room
plutonium cadmium qualine crystals
ive been very well paid for my work
im sorry to have wasted your time
no wait
listen to the rest of it
i sleep with my back to the wall
when i can sleep
i eat serpent seven times a week
there not a major city in this galaxy where
i can show my face or spend my wealth
right now your offer looks
very attractive to me
a meal a place to hide
so what do you think of him
hell fight all right
but hell fight alone
i dont care just so long as hell fight
dont worry hell be pointed
in the right direction
wait a minute
what is it
i dont know but it right in my flight path
it could be a mercenary answering your call
a mercenary in that pea shooter
listen kid in some galaxies
that would be a big ship
thalians arent much bigger than your
hand but theyre some bad customers
well whoever he is i dont
have time to play with him
put up the force field
what
put up the force field hurry
what the hell is it
a challenge
what
it seems he dont think this galaxy
is big enough for the both of you
he completely outmatched
he must know that
dont lower the force field
it too fast for you to hit
but he keeps coming at me
ignore it
it cant hurt to forget about it
that what the varda says
i want a shot at him nell
you shoot down a couple of jackers and all of
a sudden youre the scourge of outer space
will you just shut up
and help me fight him
help yourself youre being sucked in
cant you see he just playing with you
what is it what happening
a blank
a what
soft light no heat im not damaged
i have a transmission
i am saint exmin of the valkiri
i have come to coo upon you
it was a very enjoyable fight
enjoyable fight
but then all fighting is enjoyable
i have heard of your battle with
the malmori i wish to join you
oh yes what are you going to do
shoot blanks at sador
the valkiri are great warriors
in our youth we must leave home and fight in
many battles until we have proven ourselves
well youve proven yourself to be a pain in
the neck so why dont you just fly off
but i wish to fight
my planet is in danger and
youre playing tag with me
your ship is like a toy
you have no firepower
it one of the fastest in the universe
well the varda teach us that
swift rain is little rain
but i want to join
but we dont want you we dont
need you and we wont have you
so go count your coo somewhere else
you were a little harsh werent you
you saw her she was playing with me
yes and she won
would you like me to short
circuit your audio
shad to cowboy
chad to cowboy come in cowboy
cowboy are you there
whereve you been shad
youre two martinis late

what do you think we should do
run away
good idea
hurry

tekias turn and give me a shot at it
that crazy we do not know what is
get her off me
no
get her off
get her out of here get her out of here
were losing speed
turn around and face him
beautiful
i love to see a pro at work
he had a lot of practice
nell i think we may have bought ourselves
a chance let head for the surface
hail the conquering heroes
im sorry
i think they must be afraid
afraid of what
of you theyre not accustomed
to violence or violent forms
that a hell of a note
welcome to akir
why have you been hiding
why are you all afraid i brought these beings to
save your lives this is not the way to greet them
the varda teach us to trust
first and judge later
im sorry for the reception you got
welcome to our city
defenders of akir
the warning system is operational
the malmori should reach us within a
rotation and a half of this planet
we have only five fighting
ships against 25 of theirs
our only hope is to try and knock
out the stellar converter
is that possible
watch the screen
like the rest of us the malmori ship has to
lower part of its force field in order to fire
when the stellar converter is about to be
activated the ship is extremely vulnerable
maximum spread capacity with an
open shield delivery system
exactly they never bring out the converter until
all opposition has been crushed by the fighters
our job in the first contact will be to
strip the big ship of its protection
a vibration from the
sensor to dig the ditches
another three degrees
trenches honey were gonna have a war
that it right there
were gonna create the galaxy
biggest malmori cemetery
pretty impressive
ive got some more surprises
for any visitors
what drink is that
scotch and soda
i could do wonders with that boy
i would recharge his capacitators
stimulate his solenoid
tingle dingle dangle
prangle his transistors
you know sex
i cant imagine what it must be like
stick with me youll get an education
guess so
flagship to rear guard  do you read me
flagship to rear guard  do you read me
kalo tembo come in
could we possibly be out of range
not at all sir something must be wrong
what wrong is that i have an
army full of genetic mistakes
why cant my mutants be
intelligent like eli
you cant expect us to
measure up to you sir
dont flatter me those two probably
slammed their ship into an asteroid
or they may have been shot down
shot down how akir has
nothing to put in the air
somebody came to help them
help akir against me
nobody could be that stupid
not even kalo and tembo or you
do you think you could show me the ropes
ropes
well st exmin said
well she explained how on her planet
what do you do here
i dont understand
for procreation i mean
oh
well it
it very simple really
males and females
only two sexes
in balandic it takes three
and kitsel they
oh no just two just males
and females that all
that a relief
well maybe i maybe i
could show you the ropes
ive scanned information about mating
does your species have kissing
oh yes we have that
i think it your torque bar
my what
your torque bar it slipped its groove
youre going to need a new one
yes
yes i think probably youre right
a new one
what is that youre heating
that a hot dog
it comes from earth try one
you like it
there no dog in this
hydrolysed vegetable
protein soy bean meal
niacin dextrose and
sodium nitrate flavouring
that what we call meat back home
mister are you a bad man
that right
why
i dont think the way you akira do
if you think different you get called bad
how do you feel
i dont
mister were you bad when you were little
i was never that little
all right everybody theyre coming
theyve reached our checkpoints return to your ships
see you later hot blood
yeah see you later hot blood
so long good luck partner
thank you

im coming aboard
loris

he would destroy you
wonderful
i like your company
thanks
well

fall back to section five
we gotta get back well all be killed you hear me
fall back to sector five
we will all be killed
a sonar tank theyre wearing sound
barriers in case they get in front of it
even if we plug our ears
we cant get any closer
will you two radiators stand back
it hard enough to think
it seems theyre volunteering
hell what can they do
well for one thing the
kelvin have no ears
theyre cold
theyve used all their energy
get them to the protein tank hurry
come on let go
we got them now boys
let go get them
what the matter
what is it nell what the matter
im okay now shad
i i received a transmission
what is it
zed the corsair has ended
im sorry
he was the last of the great ones
shad did you see me on the monitor
there was a drone right on my tail
i pulled out and he
smashed into an asteroid
let me tell you something
this may just be a game to you
but these are my people
im sorry i forgot about your varda
i am from a warrior race
we exist for battle
our creed is to live fast fight well
and have a beautiful ending
no violent ending is beautiful
youve never seen a valkiri go down
gelt
i had to move in
half the universe trying to kill me
and i volunteered to be shot at
just lie still weve sent for a healer
what a place to end up
a minor planet in a third-rate galaxy
have somebody prepare a meal
a meal
full course then bury it with him
bury it
that was our arrangement
a meal and a place to hide
the facet that was left here
has arranged to be captured
what one sees all see
well be getting a picture soon
are you capable of speech
yes quite capable
good
and do you have a high tolerance for pain
almost none at all im afraid
how unfortunate for you
how many ships do the akira have
and what are their capabilities
if i told you that i would
give you an unfair advantage
this is my surgeon dako
dako is expert at inflicting pain
while keeping the patient alive
it good to have skills
you wont give us the information
no
i think you will
dako
lord sador
it is true we cannot tolerate pain
that facet has ended
he dead lord sador yet he gave
no indication of terminating
just give me the arm
the arm hurry
it is ready
youre an artist dako
thank you lord sador
an artist
but when we conquer akir
and we have some time
you must do something about this
what wrong
i dont know my lord
i cant control my arm
no lord sador no
i cant stop it
drop the
no
cut it cut it
we must
hurry

possibilities are unlimited

the first law of varda is
first law of the varda is to use
greater force against itself
nanelia watch the field sensors
and then reverse the thrusters

they
they have reversed thrusters
just keep the beam on them
theyll be able to board us
it wont make any difference
there they are at the forward deck

but st exmin and cowboy
nanelia
the akira believe that no form ends until all
the lives that it has touched are ended

it has done is gone
they are now a part of akir
and theyll always be with us

the task at hand
it has been our job
as the women in this family
to prepare the men

i know
i do

to give him
a couple of extra days
to get used to the idea
of all of this first
fine
but it doesnt mean
we cant start working
though
time is ticking
absolutely
tick-tock
so what are we doing
i think we should see
if he could hold his cookies
i mean after all
on christmas eve
he going to be eating
about five billion of them
and a santa on christmas eve
with an upset tummy
ooh is a cranky santa
so over here
is our test area
it kind of our
quality control
and here
our newest creations
every year we like to create
about a dozen new toys
i mean
you know how it is
kids
they get tired of their toys
so we like
to change it up
what is this
actually
that not a toy
it a contraption
im working on
that warps time and space
so when the elves
have to go back
and do damage control
they can leave the north pole
at warp speed
so how does it work
well you just
write your address here
and then but
actually it really
hasnt been tested
no dont break it
-connor
-yeah
mom and i
were wondering
if you could assist us
in the kitchen

idea

um i think im full
hello
a little white dove told me
mamma was baking
some of her famous cookies

a real hankering
for my cooking
pff yeah only because
theyre the best cookies
this side of the pole
okay
hey connor
youre looking
a little green man
everything okay
yeah
yeah im fine
yeah i was just
taste-testing
some of jessica

a little bit of a break
right connor
do you have any antacids

because no problem
i am jack frost
after all

what
that was tasty

all at once
ill do my best
but no guarantees
thanks jess
hey holly can i talk to you

so what was that
in there
what was what
i see the ring on your finger
you were testing him
you dont know
what youre talking about jack
does he even know
what he in for
wow
well all i have to say
is good luck
i mean by the way
he failed miserably
with those cookies
looks like youve got
your work cut out for you
always nice
to see you jack
just remember holly
christmas is the
most special day
of the year
you dont want to ruin it
by giving the job
to someone who cant handle it
right
im just saying
i brought you
some antacids
thank you
jack still here
no he left
nice
he got quite the appetite
ive never seen
anything like that
he was just showing off
yeah
for you or your mom
connor you dont have
to be jealous of him
i know i know
it just
kind of seems like he fits in
and
i
you have nothing
to worry about okay
youre going
to fit in
ill make sure of it
okay
could you please tell your mom
that i might skip dinner
tonight
sure
thanks again
only two
marshmallows
i need the rest
for the smores
okay
so where
this connor fellow
i think he down
in the factory
he seems very interested
in what the elves are doing
sounds like he might
be better served
making toys
than being santa
what
come on
jessica
dont tell me you dont
have your doubts
i mean he from the south
for goodness sakes
it never gets colder
than 30 degrees down there
now jack we have to
give the boy a chance
and i think holly
is going to do
a really good job
at training him
yeah but what if he fails
so i guess
congratulations are in order
yes thank you
must be lots to do
before the big day
geez
speaking of which
connor you ever
slide down a chimney before
excuse me
hol and i used to do it
when we were kids
all the time
we had so much fun
remember hol
yeah ive slid down
a few banisters in my day
well then
you shouldnt have
any problem at all
with a chimney
what do you say
we give it a go
is it always
this windy
yeah it
the north pole
ho how are you my girl
i thought id have myself
a quick read
what
nothing
dont tell me nothing
i know you
tell me
what what
it all good
youll see
good news though
it really hot
in the chimney
think you can
handle the heat
yeah i can
handle the heat
well see about that
here goes nothin
ooh
jack
just doing a little
chimney sliding nick
jack
such fun
all right buddy
youre up
yeah yeah
ill be right down
wow
connor you dont
have to do this
dont worry
i got this babe
what are you kids
up to
yeah yeah
whoa aah
connor
hello
are you
all right
yeah yeah
just a little stuck i think
well
pull your shoulders together
and suck it in
yeah still not working
i got you buddy
use the ol poker trick
-jack jack
-what
not helping
relax everyone
ill
ill melt the butter
my
are you sure
youre okay
yeah yeah
yeah im fine
i just you know
came down on a wrong angle
or something
okay
it was a solid
effort connor
youre a good sport
yeah
how it going
hey
it okay
um listen
about today
yeah
yeah that went well
yeah
listen that
was my own stupidity
like thinking i could
actually slide down a chimney
it not like im your dad
or anything
what i should
be able to do
is make a toy
that kids actually
want to play with
but for whatever reason
i dont know what to do
to make it better
or more fun
or whatever it is
ive got to do to this thing
to make it
more interesting to kids
i guess
i could make an app
or add some lights
or something
but that kind of
like plffft
you know once my dad
gave me a doll
and it was kind of
an ugly doll
to be honest
it was one of
the elves prototypes
and it didnt
quite work out
and i didnt want
to play with it
and so it just sat
on my bedroom shelf
for months and months
and then one day
i spilled hot cocoa
and i got the
doll dress dirty
and so i picked her up
and i started cleaning her
and the moment that doll
was in my hands
it was like magic
i cleaned her
i dressed her
and for the first time
i played with her
and from that moment on
she was my
most favorite doll
so you see
sometimes you just
have to get the toy
into the child hands
for them to realize
how wonderful it is
youll get it
thanks
my mr claus
smells something yummy
from mrs claus kitchen
ho-ho good morning dumpling
where are the children
holly is out
feeding the animals
and i have connor
chopping firewood

a couple dozen of my cookies
well i always had
a good appetite
but we still had our doubts
about me
like when you forgot
to harness the reindeer
and they took off
without you

into shape

the same for him
besides the boy has
plenty of christmas spirit
that will get him through

a date yet
rush what
um
i was i was just
telling snowball
that now that were engaged
that we dont have to
rush getting married
we can take our time
and set a date
and plan and
you know actually
i was thinking
maybe we could
we could do that sooner
rather than later
sooner
okay well
the summer is always nice
and the the fall
would be beautiful
with all the leaves
i was actually thinking
this christmas
this christmas
yeah why not
were already here
your family here
mario the elves
plus your dad
will be done
delivering all
the presents
he can kick back
have an extra egg nog
or two
but what about
your parents
well first of all
my parents are in
florida vacationing
like they do
every christmas
second of all
they eloped themselves
i already talked
to them on the phone
and theyre great with it
is that
your holiday stew
yes it is
a couple bowls of this
has kept your father going
all christmas
for almost 30 years
i thought a bowl or two
might help connor along
yeah
yeah
um speaking of connor
we have set a wedding date
you did when
christmas day
honey that
gives us plenty of time
christmas day this year
good golly gumdrops
holly claus
that in less
than a week
i know but he was
just so excited
about being here
and us being here and
so he already knows
actually i wanted to give him a
little bit more time to
holly really
mom please
i just think
that if can complete one task
he going to feel
a lot better about this
well let see
if he could handle
the sleigh
perfect
except for now
let keep the reindeer
out of it
right
all right
these new hydraulics
should take some of the load
off the reindeer
so you can get
to where you need to go
faster
ooh
you guys needed me
yeah
um sweetie
mario just added
hydraulics
to the sleigh
to ease the load
and we were hoping
that you might
test-drive it for us
considering
you probably know
a little more about this
than dad
yeah
im used to
using reindeer dust
absolutely
yeah i used to build
go-karts when i was a kid
i got this
climb aboard captain
okay so what have we got
these ones start it up
this one gives it the lift
but right now
you just want to ease it
out of the barn
in a hover
you got it
got it
all right
good man good man
here we go
that was festive good tune
yeah
attaboy attaboy
sounds good
-yeah
-yeah
it sounds
like it warmed up
so now
just go up into a hover
-here i go
-here you go here you go
nice and easy
i i dont know
what happened
everything was good
mario
duct tape
here you go donner
that enough thistle
good night now
hey
can mario fix the sleigh
hell set it right
dad do you think
connor can do it
now now now
let have none of that talk
but he hasnt been able
to finish a single task
holly
i flunked
rooftop parallel parking
seven times
my first chimney slide
i landed
smack in the fire
singed my south pole
couldnt sit down
for a week
darlin if i can do this
have faith he can
hey holly
i think i might need
some aspirin
what about you
you know
where the aspirin is
hey there partner
looking for these
nice catch
yeah thanks
so from what i hear
the big day
is right around the corner
yup
bet you never thought
youd be in the shoes youre in
no some pretty big shoes
wow that an understatement
i mean how many
people can say
theyre marrying
santa daughter
just me
that right
just you youre the one
that right
and it just you
taking on that big red
jolly responsibility too
that right
gee im sorry
i dont really know
what youre talking about
just the whole
santa legacy thing
i mean you
cant tell me
youre not just
a little bit freaked out
about the idea
of becoming santa right
wow
she hasnt told you has she
what
well this is awkward
for me
okay so
what youre saying
is that
because im marrying holly
im actually
next in line
to be santa
that about right
hit the nail
on the head
why wouldnt
she tell you
you know
yeah of course
i guess
she could have her reasons
like maybe in her heart
she knows
youre not cut out for the job
look im
im sorry
forget i said anything
all right
youre a good man
connor okay
and im sure
you understand
that christmas
is the most magical day
of the year
which is why i know
you wouldnt want to spoil it
for generations to come
right buddy
feel better bud
ooh
hey snowball
okay ill take care
of that
we need some aspirin
actually i already
took care of it
you did
i think i should just
go check on him anyway
it okay
he was almost asleep
poor guy
really
that arctic air
is really knocking him out
yeah
so why dont you
just let him rest
let say we have
a cup of cider
i really should
id love
some cider
after a day like this
ill take two cups
all right
then well all
raise a glass
i
i really should um
-come on yeah
-okay
all right
so we snuck out
around midnight
without waking
any of the elves
and then
we pushed the sleigh
out of the barn
holly bribed the reindeer
so theyd help us out
and keep quiet
with candy apples
that right
with candy apples
so we pushed the sleigh
far enough away
that when we took off
you guys wouldnt hear us
youre such rascals
well it didnt hurt
that we gave you hot cocoa
that right
where did you two fly to
we went all the way
to the top of snowy ridge
it was beautiful
you always could
handle the sleigh jack
well i had
a great co-pilot
-ooh
-aw
im about ready for a top-off
how about we do
some christmas caroling
you guys used to do
some caroling
what was one of the songs
you used to sing
you mean this one
it came upon
the midnight clear
that glorious song of old
that the one
come on holly
join me up here
no
join in
-no i dont want to
-come on
honey we havent heard
you sing in so long
this is true
come on
all right
from angels
bending near the earth
to touch their harps of gold
this
is wonderful
it came upon
the midnight clear
that glorious song of old
from angels
bending near the earth
to touch their harps
of gold
this is nice
yeah
peace on the earth
goodwill to men
from heaven
all-gracious king
it came upon
the midnight clear
that glorious song of old
and all the world
give back the song
which now the angels sing
what a lovely
evening
thank you jack
aw you know
there no place
that id rather be
im going to
go check on connor
all right
good night jack
yeah good night
night
good night jack
thanks for the memories
old friend
thank you guys
safe home
holy night
all is calm
all is bright
connor sweetie
are you okay
dear holly
the first day
i laid eyes on you
i knew id be a lucky man
if you ever gave me
a second glance
because not only
were you the most beautiful girl
in the room
but you were the most radiant
but i took a chance
and when i did
not only did you give me
a second glance
but one
of the most magical nights
of my life
i know ive told you before
holly
but i fell in love with you
that night
and nothing has come close
to that moment
until the day you said yes
i love you holly
and id do anything
for you
which is why
im saying goodbye
because you deserve someone
who will take the reins
and fill your father boots
in a way
that ill never be able to
and i cherish christmas too much
for that
and i love you even more
merry christmas holly
love always connor
craftsmanship nowadays
you think
this is real funny do you
what is it
jingles
i was
i was going to tell him
you know
prepare him
but i guess he found out
and panicked
but that not
the worst of it
the worst of it
is that i doubted him
i doubted if
he was up for the job
of being santa
which is terrible
because i love him
i guess if i had
kept the faith
and not fallen
into doubt
he would still be here
chestnut there was
nothing you did
this is on him
and destiny
and if it was meant to be
the stars will align
and believe me
hell be back
what if that
doesnt happen
well
youll still
be all right
i just got a huge order
for hunky santa dolls
yes
merry christmas
hey
yeah
i heard
what happened
and that lousy
i mean
a dear john letter
i mean at least
be man enough
to tell you
to your face right
i guess that why
he not cut out
for the job
what do you want jack
what ive always wanted
you
really jack now
now is a better time
than never
i cant lose you
again holly
youve got to know it
were meant for each other
your dad knows it
your mom knows it
youve got to know it
i mean
think about how much fun
we all had together
the other night
right
and there no doubt that
im the man for the job
i
just think about it
that all im asking
wow
that quite the piece of ice
you got there
jack gave it to me
he asked me to marry him
in so many words
well cant say
im surprised
i guess you think
that a good idea
he would make
a great santa
i dont think
anything other than
wanting my little girl
to be happy
and does he
does jack make you happy
i dont think
it matters does it
you know what i love best
about being santa
the look on
those kids faces
when they open up
a present
theyve been wishing for
all year
the twinkle
they get in their eyes
the flush of pink
to their cheeks
the feeling of pure joy
now you tell me
does it matter
if he makes you happy
connor
surprised to
see you here buddy

taken off for the holidays

millions in the
immediate aftermath and untold
more in the ensuing weeks from
radiation exposure

stupid post-it notes and your
blind denial and all that weird
psychoanalyzation

harriet
isaiah
the earth is polluted because
of its inhabitants who have
transgressed laws violated
statues broken the ancient
covenant
therefore a curse devours
the earth
he knew it
forest knew it
and he was righteous
i never doubted him

not once
why are
just nod your head
secrets
going after the bases if you
ask me
koreans
north koreans

asses back into judgment day

the earth
its people must bear the guilt

forest knew it

pay for your sins
all of you from the west they

youre a failure cause youre
drunk like your father
now you go back to the candy
cause that is where you turn
the light on
where you turn the light on
die
youre drunk
and then you join all your
friends in the afterlife because
you were alive on the chip pile
the whole time and time is
irrelevant
and that the plot of loss
do you ever wonder why
everyone on tv looks so good
when everything going to shit
like
milla jovovich
she looked hot
hold on dear
like a barnacle on the ship
of fear
im out here
like an island on a sea
of tears
hah

let just go inside okay
okay

let just say for a second that
there is a god
why would he hate fags
i mean why would he hate
anyone
i thought that was the point
of having a devil
i just dont get it
did i ever tell you about that
friend of mine when i was
little what was her name
lisa something or other
she was super-religious
i didnt realize it at the time
but her parents used to take me
to sunday school and mass every
sunday when we were playing and
years later i get this christmas
card and i swear to god the
only three words they used in
the entire card were jesus
savior and amen
how do you make a sentence
with those three words
how do you send a card to
somebody
come with me to austin
what
i am
no
stay with me
in austin to live
yeah right
harriet
look it safer there and
youve always said you wanted to
get out of la
you know austin could be
a fresh start
i dont know harriet
okay
i bet austin has a great art
scene and it smaller so it
would be easier to break your
way into
and you always say that
youve slept with everyone in
los angeles so itd be a whole
new population
that was a joke
los angeles
is a wasteland
there nothing there anymore
it not fair to say that
there nothing there
no reba what im trying
to tell you is that
shh
what
it them
who
the hipsters
get down
we have to hide
where
were in the middle of the road
wait i have an idea
man this chick has a ton
of books
books are no longer useful
except as fire fuel
that ridiculous
yeah it really is man
god
i think that i have the runs
again
just cause there a nuclear
war doesnt mean we cant read
and we wont
i mean what the point
im sorry
what the point of reading
i dont know man
how about education or
entertainment or just trying
to expand your world view
a little bit
how about that
youre never gonna make it
what if mexico just as
fucked
as long as they didnt
detonate nuclear weapons against
their own people
you dont know that what
happened
it so obvious
what about al-qaeda
what about
al-qaeda
what kind of fucking moron are
you
okay
what terrorist organization
could detonate four bombs within
the us at the exact same time
moron
what government could do that
without us finding out about it
right away with four cities that
happen to have key military
bases right by
just shut up all right
you sound like a crazy person
right man
i dont know
hey

person who could hear it so
here goes
um
you know if i was being honest
with myself i dont have a lot
going right now
i mean im not a loser but
im sort of just nothing
sort of a walking example
of unfulfilled potential
so anyway i applied to grad
school and didnt get in
but regardless im im
going and it the first time
in my life that
i havent just fallen into
whatever easiest
and for better or for worse
im dragging my friend along
with me and and that may not
mean anything to you but it
means the world to me and
that car right there that my
stuff

to let help shine a light
along the road
so lean on me

unknown
the world has changed

by the enemy millions are
dead many more will die in
the next days weeks months
we are at war
what your answer

prophet forest

to go but up for you
if youve been hurt or youve
been betrayed or youve been
fucked or youve been
displaced
you were told it was probably
your fault anyway
but when your hustler
subscription and your xanax
prescriptions
make you feel lonelier
instead
you dont want to hear about
all those starving children
you dont want to be told it
all in your head
cause if it all in your
head
that terrible
i saw a junkie lying in a
puddle of his own blood last
week
i saw a cyclist get hit by a
car
i saw a homeless guy chug a
bottle of mouthwash on christmas
eve
no you can never fall too
far
you can buy a salad glove
you can buy an ipod
and you can sell that shit to
bookman when your wife dies
and you lose your job
you can hope it gets better
you can follow your dreams
but hope is for presidents and
dreams are for people who are
sleeping

who will be your partner
eliot arnold story

except eliot story

i hope i didnt ruin anything
for you
i iook at this ad
and it doesnt say
fish hook ale to me
this sucks
bruce what
im trying to do --
do you know what
my business philosophy is
no bruce
what is it
my business philosophy
is that there a lot of people
in the world
that certainly
isnt --
and all these people
want something
do you know what they want
well i --
they want to feel good
you know what i mean
yeah well i --
no you dont know
what i mean

this piece of shit here
what the hell is this
why are you saying ugly

bruce
w-what im doing here

in a humorous fashion
get hooked on fish hook --
that the concept
you got a guy and a boat
and a girl
the giri in a bikini
she has big tits
theyre on a boat getting
shitfaced drinking fish hook ale
the girl
has really big tits
the feeling of this ad is
somebody going to get laid

i gave you the perfect concept
and you give me ugly
all right all right
bruce ill try --
no no dont tell me try
i hate the word try
try is for losers

only ad agency in this town
a year ago
i had a nice house
a beautiful wife
and a job i really loved
now i was being called a loser
by this guy
for 8 years i wrote a column
for the miami herald --
funny stories the higher-ups
referred to as offbeat
deeber wants
to see you
because id won two pulitzer
prizes for my offbeat stories
i was pretty much left alone
and treated with a great deal
of respect

assignment and you will do it
or what ken

in here before you go home

in there right now
deeber picked
the wrong day to be a jerk
earlier that day
i had found out
my wife was having an affair
with her tennis instructor
in retrospect
i should have written
the day-care crisis piece
and never opened
eliot arnold advertising

at a second chance
had just arrived in miami
onboard flight 57
from new orleans
the suitcase
was sandwiched between
a quarter-ton of frozen crawfish
and a dalmatian that gave birth
to a litter of 7
over lake okeechobee
the dalmatian
made the evening news
the suitcase didnt
what is it
it looks like
a garbage disposal
so this is miami huh
they can keep it
you got that right
that a remington
30-aught-6 hunting rifle
with a bushnell scope
charlton heston takes his
to shoot bighorn elk
henry desalvo
and leonard ferroni
take theirs to shoot anyone
as long as theyre paid
25 grand apiece
we play with a guy
that cheats
actually henry and
leonard didnt play golf at all
will you come on
weve got an early tee time
they were in miami
to kill a man named arthur herk
who had stolen money
from his employer
puggy arrived in miami
the same day as the hit men
and the suitcase
but for a much different reason
a week earlier
at his place in boston
puggy read an article
in martha stewart living
that said miami had some
of the finest cuban restaurants
in the entire world
since fritos
were his favorite food
and corn chips
as close to cuban cuisine
as puggy had ever eaten
he decided to hop a fishing boat
and check it out
puggy could not have been
happier
after only 20 minutes in miami
puggy was already thinking
that this had to be the warmest
friendliest place on earth
you stink
beer and a bag of fritos
she ran track for 0 years
she definitely has the legs
out
i teii you once before
you two out
look man we got money
and well take however

just outside louisville

having similar tastes in humor

into strength conditioning

being in the universe
entered his life
under the influence of the
toad hallucinogenic chemicals
roger thought his furry butt

my husband such an idiot
he probably really upset

what does a guy iike arthur
do for a iiving
he an executive
at penultra corporation
i did
an article on them once
they built the jail downtown
where the plumbing doesnt work
i called it
crapital punishment
eliot arnold
from the herald
i used to read your column
you were so funny
what happened
i lost my sense of humor
in the divorce
how does a guy like arthur
end up
with someone like you
i married him
when jenny was little
my first husband
left us kind of early
and we had to move to this
crappy little apartment
and i met arthur
he was different then
i keep looking up divorce
lawyers in the phone book
but then i think about
that horrible apartment
it unavailable
i live there
can i borrow this
im totally into
the seminal fluids
arthur threw mine out
at the carwash
he doesnt think it music
unless somebody
playing an accordion
ill drive
i say we blame
the whole evening
on rap music and too much
violence on television
you could yell at me if itd
make you feel more dad-like
i dont want
to yeii at you
why dont we talk
you and i --
let just talk
come on
okay mom wanted me
to remind you
that the alimony check
is due monday
see
that wasnt so hard
look matt --
dad i messed up tonight
everybody messes up
you know that
better than anybody
so all im saying is
i dont think i need
any fatheriy advice from you
about how to live my life
when youre not doing
such a hot job living yours
hey were talking
okay
now it my turn
up yours
you little shithead
your turn
puggy
i bring you some lunch
listen i love you
you see
you see the difference
you ask a guy
what he wants --
tits or an ugly fish --
see what he tells you
probably --
tits i gotta boogie
hey she should
be leaning over
for maximum exposure
maximum exposure
maximum exposure
that advertising
terminology
oh i see
to what do i owe
this pleasure
uh did you happen to lose
a pair of reading glasses
last night
i dont wear glasses
oh well then i guess i
made the trip for nothing
nonsense ill need them one
day -not right this minute
well things change
ill need them
um hey could i offer you
some coffee
that would be wonderful
it more of a dare
than an offer actuaiiy
did the police
find anything
well
after meeting arthur
they figure
im the primary suspect
so
how do you uh
like it
oh light and sweet
mmm
mmm
oh
mmm
mmm
uh mm oh
i forgot my jacket
got room for a third
no harm in asking
mm
i hope
i didnt hurt you

mmm
later that day
arthur herk stopped by to have
a friendly chat with his boss
morning douche bag
arthur
jesus what happened
to your hair
it a wig you moron
dont act stupid
i know you know
what going on
those dickwads upstairs
are trying to have me whacked
hey hey first of all those
decisions are made way over my head
and secondly you stole money
from them arthur
what do you expect them
to do
look bitch you take that express
elevator upstairs to the top floor
and you tell those sugar-cane-sucking
scumbags to lay off
or im gonna blow the lid
on this whole operation
youre putting me
in a very awkward position
no no no
no no no no no
an awkward position
is what youre going to be in
when the fbl is shining a
proctoscope up your big fat ass
i have evidence
and ill use it
he didnt have evidence
but he knew
where he could get some
and that made arthur herk
a very dangerous man
arthur may not have been
a genius
but he did know that the bullet
that went through x ena head
was meant for his
penultra construction had arranged
for the hit when they discovered
arthur had been skimming money
from the company
up until yesterday arthur herk
had been their bagman
gentlemen
we have a problem
can i get personal
oh now youre asking
your daughter
really likes you
yeah we have
a pretty good relationship
the divorce arthur -she doesnt
throw any of that in your face
oh i told jenny a long time
ago that i wasnt perfect
she tried
to accept my mistakes
and i try to accept hers
sounds simple
well i mean
it wasnt that simple
when she came home with a
scorpion tattooed on her butt
matt hates me
he basically thinks
im a loser
he called me a loser
so i called him a shithead
if we had bad teeth we
could go on jerry springer
so what youre telling me
is that her mom beat you up
well she
in pretty good shape man
i mean she couid snap you
iike a toothpick

in a weird kinda place
no no he does not
want to go against you

jeff
when pink is cold jeff sneezes hell
learn better if he lives long enough
youve been mighty scarce
since you moved here to griffin
farm keeps a man busy
farming

doesnt seem your style
you changed a lot since the
old days down on the border
look different without
that 45 strapped to you
have to admit i miss it now and then
got everybody around here fooled
remember the last time
we had a drink together
del rio
you were with the
texas rangers then
i thought youd come in to shut me down
no no
i had other fish
to fry that night
another one
this is not exactly a social call goldie

that a lot of money logan

why i came to you
well i dont carry that
much money with me

look at you susan girl

you always were a
good nurse susan

no he a big boy now
i was hoping to see him
sam he doesnt
know youre his father
well he will soon enough
try to understand sam
everything is different now
nothing is different susan not with me
so logan left you all alone eh
well he he ought to
know better than that
a beautiful woman like you shouldnt
be all by herself like that it not safe
and that how i lost you remember
you cant really believe that
well it true isnt it
a little sweet talk from logan
when my back was turned and
well you just got a
little mixed up honey
sam you went
away to prison for life
you knew they werent
going to keep me there
couple years and id had enough
came out looking for my wife
sam im not your wife
you knew about the divorce
well now we wont worry about that
look i understand honey
this this thing with logan
was just a a handy way out
for you while i was gone
logan had nothing to do with it
sam our marriage was through when you
first started making your way with a gun
logan took you when
i was behind bars
when i couldnt fight for you
well im out now and
im taking you back
it finished between us
is it susan
let see if it is
well logan is
logan is got a stronger
hold on you than i figured
too bad we dont have more time
therell never be time not for us
youll come around
susan when logan is dead
ill be back you can
count on that honey
he was here
yes
we drove all night
ill put him to bed
he came here to kill you
somehow i never really believed hed try
he said hed be back
weve got to move logan weve got to
go some place where hell never find us
no use running
besides i just paid the bank
we cant stay here now
he coming back to kill
you and to take sammy
he found us here
hed find us anywhere
best chance is to see he
caught and sent back to prison
cant they get him without you
who knows him as well as i do
i was praying youd never
have to use that gun again
i know
i hope you dont
have to kill him
is the last thing i want to do
logan
dont take any chances
i dont want you to kill him
but if it has to be you or him
if it comes to that
i want you to come back
oh i want you to come back
you fellas shoot then
ask questions later en
we was certain you was ward
im sorry to disappoint you
say ive had enough of this
anyway let head back for town
what the matter leach
beginning to wish you were back
at the saloon throwing out drunks
youd better lay off
you must be part of sheriff
moore handpicked posse
yeah we are what are
you doing out here all alone
where the rest of
the posse tucker
we lost the trail the sheriff split
us up into bunches to cut sign
this tracking is supposed to
be your long suit isnt it diggs
ive tracked a sight of them
but this fella ward is might tricky
did you know was sam ward we was after
yeah i knew
id like to come up against him
maybe youll get a chance
keliher you never did say
what you was doing way out here
i was trailing sam ward
that aint ward horse
no im riding ward horse he stole mine
funny thing he just
happened to stop by your place
isnt funny to me
good way to get a
bullet in you lottie
something went wrong
well not altogether
what happened to the others
they wont be back
my man ira
what about him
he got killed in the getaway
i want his share of that money
you sure do come right to
the point dont you baby eh
well how about it
about what
about the money
i want ira share
it mine now
well you might be selling
out too cheap lottie girl
on
you got something else in mind
ah maybe
just how much did you get
enough for you and me to blow
the town of el paso wide open
el paso
el paso
yeah i think id
like that just fine
wont take me any time to get ready
no no no hold on hold on
let spend a couple of
days getting acquainted eh
yeah youre not a bad
looking woman lottie
doll you up a little bit there why you
could hold your own with most any company
oh i bet you know how
to spend money sam
well now ill tell you
i never been able to save any
you know something
ira told me i was going to like you
when he talked me into coming up here
was he right-
well you didnt grieve
very long did you
about as long as he
wouldve grieved for me
yeah i like that
you know a man will always know
where he stands with you lottie
couldnt trail a herd of buffaloes
through this kind of going
you think there any
point in looking further
as long weve gone this far
i say were wasting
our time let turn back
how about you and jeff pink
well town would look pretty
good to me right about now
me too ive had a
bellyful of this riding blind
im afraid ill have to agree
we might as well call it quits
diggs
you know this country
real well dont you
better than most
all right let say youre
an outlaw on the run
where the one place
you wouldnt go from here
right up there
why not
because nothing there
but rocks and rattlesnakes
unless maybe you want to
count them murdering apaches
they hole up back
in there after a raid
sounds like just the kind
of a place ward would pick
that be just a wild goose chase
then why dont you go back
because youre too anxious think
ill just string along just in case
i wish they had gone back
if they have left there have
been fewer of us to split the money
worry about the reward
after we catch him
i wasnt thinking
about the reward
i think ill wear
my hair piled high
maybe an ostrich plume
and a red satin dress
oh yeah i look good in
red you like red sam eh
sam
yeah
oh youll be proud of me
red satin hair up and silk
nothing but silk
next to my body
oh i love the feel of silk
yeah so do i
hold it sam
hey you took me
by surprise logan i didnt have that
much luck when i came looking for you
about the unluckiest
thing you ever did
now stay over there
it all right lottie it me he wants
ill make a deal with you logan
youre not exactly in a
position to make a deal
give me my gun
well settle this between
us right here and now
no
you owe me that much
i dont owe you anything sam
give me my gun
look one of us will walk out of
here and thatll be the end of it
that be easy for you you
dont have anything to lose i do
turn around
lean your head against the wall
let see them
what about me
for now you might
stir up a pot of coffee
look i didnt do anything
i was just waiting here for them
to come back now that no crime
well let the law decide that
watch that arm i took a slug in it
i know i put it there
you were in griffin
i wish i had seen you
i saw you plain enough after my
first bullet dropped you now sit down
why didnt you shoot me again
ah you felt guilty
sure you felt guilty about
stealing my wife and kid
no
we were friends once sam
it not easy to shoot an old friend
friends
that a long way back logan and
ive got one big advantage over you
you wont kill me
unless you have to
i wont hesitate one
second about killing you
so you got him all by yourself
good going keliher
man cant have no privacy anywhere
hey pink look what we got here
turn around honey
let have a look at you
i said turn around
say youre a looker eh
you can keep my share of the
reward fellas ill take this instead
take your hands off of me
leave her alone
what is to you
i said leave her alone
you giving the orders
from now on keliher
im giving the orders
how come
after all he took ward
yeah that right he did
all right jeff leave her alone
did you find the money
i didnt even look for it
figured i have plenty of help
you found ward easy enough
ill make him tell where it is
you make me tell
you wont get it out of him like that
ill bet she knows where is hid
no
she knows all right
just give me a minute with her
what the matter with you fellas
anyway talking about torturing people
the money cant
be that hard to find
well aint back there
maybe hid it outside
let start looking for it then
hey old timer come here
you better protect
your interest eh
theyre sure anxious
about that bank money
yeah too anxious
im sure glad
youre along tucker
ill do what i can
you got enough
to feed this bunch
then start fixing
i have to get wood
go ahead
you wasting time sam
oh im in no hurry
my chances are looking
better by the minute
id say your chances are mighty slim
unless you say where the money is
you want them to beat it out of you
im not worried logan
as long i got you here to protect
me from those honest citizens
it in the fireplace
the fireplace
i said i could make her talk
leach
i see you found it
he almost got away
how much you get
i dont know yet
come on well give
you a hand with it
i was hoping that fight out there
wouldve lasted a little longer
so i noticed
that sweet bunch you got there
i didnt pick them
well maybe you shouldve boy
more than 20000
i dont think ive ever seen
that much in one pile before
this would buy a high
old time back in griffin
boys boys
there no reason you
shouldnt keep that money
why sure let let me go
and nobody back in griffin ever need
know that you found me or the money
that kind of an
interesting thought
yeah it worth
considering all right
there only one thing wrong
with it we cant trust you
now if you were dead
wed be home free
we could tell them back in
griffin that we had to kill
ward and that we
couldnt find the money
what about her
shed tell the whole thing
well get rid of her too
hold on killing ward is one thing
but i aint for murdering no woman
you dont have to
do it ill take care of it
i killed many a squaw indian
fighting taint no different
that money is going back to
griffin these two are going with it
i dont think you can
stop us weve got diggs
now jeff here is a little squeamish but when
it comes right down to it hell back me
you might have tucker on your side
of course i stand behind keliher
that cold blooded
murder youre talking about
well i kind of figured
youd see it that way
leach i dont imagine
youre quite so high minded
sure aint
you like the odds
we got callers apaches
most likely scouts
for a raiding party
we can make a mighty
tempting target there
let get them before they get away
no
you shoot and be a war
party down here no time
we cant just
wait till they hit
afraid youre right turn
this place into a graveyard
i think we better start act like
we dont know theyre out there
and after dark
can try slip away
you think he right about
that apache war party
when you go leave me here
id as soon take my chances with
those apaches as with this bunch
not a very good
bet either way sam
tie my hands in front here
will you i can ride a lot better
yeah and you can grab a gun
a lot better too couldnt you
why logan you know
me better than that
ill take my own horse back
oh i thought was a fair trade
i didnt leach
give him a hand
stick with me ill
look out for you
over against that ledge quick
what did you see
nothing
the best thing
you couldve seen
theyre probably hitting
the cabin about now
i wouldnt have given a plugged
nickel for our chances last night
how much you think theyll be worth after
them indians find out theyve been tricked
im plumb wore out when
you figuring on stopping
well not here
that girl needs some rest
those apaches catch up with
us shell get a good long rest
this will have to do
that keliher
that keliher he
sure pushes hard doesnt he
yeah too hard
you want me to help you
find a place to bed down
no thanks ill
all right
all right sam bail off
you better post a lookout i know
them apaches they aint give up
ill take the first watch whoever
is on guard keeps an eye on ward
you and ward seem
uncommon friendly
in case you get any ideas remember
i sleep lighter than a night owl
stay awake all night if you
want to tie these horses off
no no no not now later
ill come to you
you get a strange sense of humor
sam then you always did have
no no i was just remembering
that night on the concho
when we were in the rangers
together remember that night
yeah i remember it
yeah was comanche country
just the two of us
on guard that night
all those shadows out there
yeah we were a little edgy
oh captain
roberts he he said
he said the comanches never
never strike at night remember
yeah yeah well just when we getting
a little comfort from that thought
those comanches hit us boy they came
hollering and veiling in out of the night
scared us half to death
yeah we had quite a
fight on our hands that night
oh logan logan
in those days i thought more of
you than anybody in the whole world
i wouldve put my
life in your hands
matter of fact i did
well it just goes to show you
how wrong you can be about people
first time i get in a little trouble first
time i get on the wrong side of the law
you turn against me
well i havent trust
in anybody since
i didnt turn on you sam
i even quit the rangers so
wouldnt have to go after you
you quit the rangers so you
could go after my wife and kid
that not true
sam you left that girl broke
and homeless with a baby to raise
well that dont give you no
license to go out stealing them
we didnt even think about
getting married the first i
felt the responsibility
because you were my friend
a responsibility i
dont think you ever felt
logan everything
that i ever did
i did for them and their sake
shooting a man and
going to prison for life is not
exactly the right way to raise a family
well i didnt mean to shoot that
man i mean not the first one anyway
and then after i i broke out well i had
no choice but to go on making it with my gun
you didnt have to
come looking for me
oh yes i did logan
that the one
thing i did have to do
there something you
better get straight sam
susan is my wife
now and i love her
and sammy is my son not yours
was only a baby when you left
all these years he had
my love and ive had his
it not enough just
to plant the seed sam
the real father is the man who
gives his whole life to a child
im the father sammy is
my flesh he my blood
and im going to kill you
for taking him away from me
no not here over there
where they cant see us
come on
all right let
get ready to ride
on ward jumping you like that kind of sets
my mind at ease about a couple of things
well now you know
this yours
you tricked me you dirty little
no i didnt let me got
you were supposed to be guarding him
stop crowding me or ill make you wish
turned west here
he heading right back the way he came
not anymore
hi boys
you must be getting to
like that horse of mine sam
nice of you to bring
him back this time
yeah well i figured youd
appreciate that aint it
brought back a mess
of apaches to boot
thought you preferred those indians to us
no i changed my mind
there a place to
stand them off up ahead
rifle sam
what the matter boy dont
like the way i shoot apaches
yeah you shoot apaches fine
we did it
we whipped them
you dont know much about indians do you
think theyll be back
theyll be back all right it
a matter of when and how
keep an eye on him
why dont we try and get out
of here while we got the chance
yeah sure those apaches
would like that just fine
ill take my chances right here
everything all right back here
yeah i guess so are they gone
for now
look i can use a gun if i have to
we may need you
do we have much chance
well give them a fight
guess youre safe enough here

argument about that just now

-----NewMovie-----
this is where i live
im a housewife
my name is ellen jones
that tuesday in july started out
just like any other day
the past few months
there was no warning it was to be
the most terrifying day of my life
i remember thinking how tired i felt
even the housework seemed drudgery
so meaningless with
george confined to his bed
no-one to see or care even
and then i got scared
because i knew i was beginning
to feel sorry for myself
george was the one who was ill
and he needed all of my
thoughts and attention
and above all my cheerfulness
i tried not to think about us
about george
how he had changed
i told myself it was
just my imagination
that things would be different
when he was well and strong again
then i thought i heard him call
george did you call
george are you alright
yes ellen
do you want anything
not now ive just begun work on
an insurance report for the office
well call me dear if you need me
okay
somehow i had an odd feeling
there was something
about george voice
i found myself thinking
about the first time we met
how different he was in those days
i remember i was sitting
in dr grahame office
we were talking
i played one game of checkers
and two games of rummy
and ive written letters to a wife
a mother and a sweetheart
and i listened for half an hour to a
homesick young ensign from texas
he was awful cute
now what else can i do to help
boost the morale around here
you could go out to dinner with me
wed get half way through the soup
and youd get a call from the hospital
youre right
uhuh
i guess my courting will have
to wait until after the hostilities
there a compound fracture down
the hall who waiting to see me
but ill be tied up for a while
oh
they tell me he feeling blue you see
his wife is expecting a baby any minute
i think he can stand some cheering up
it practically done
see you later rann
im sorry they told me i
could find dr grahame in here
he ought to be along any minute
why dont you come on in
thank you
are you a patient here sir
in a naval hospital no no
im just a friend of the doc
i flew in last night with
the ferry command
the only thing wrong with me
is a double-barrelled hangover
dr graham will be detained so
im taking you for an airing
maybe he doesnt want
to go for an airing
he doesnt
there nothing a woman likes
better than shoving a man around
hello
hey
who are you
im ellen brown
doesnt suit you at all
it much too plain
im sorry id tell my parents about it
but they are still back in kansas city
now what can i do for you young man
i can think of a lot of things
oh
well shall we begin
with a game of cards
uhuh
well i could read the newspaper to you
i could write a letter for you
i know
i know ill sit right here
and you can tell me about that
wonderful baby you are expecting
huh
the baby you are expecting
does ripley know about this
i beg your pardon
skip it
which is your bad leg
well neither one of them
is working very well today
oh my head
is your head bothering you
terribly
both of them
would you like me to rub it for you
i couldnt think of anything nicer
here
now relax
close your eyes
now just think of something pleasant
pretty soon youll be going
home to your wife
wont that be wonderful
hmm
think what she looks like
how pretty she is
lovely
beautiful blue eyes
a short nose
soft brown hair
and lovely kissable lips
whoa there is nothing wrong
with your morale young man
ill recommend to the doctor that you
be sent home to your wife immediately
hey wait a minute
you are all dressed
naturally
george
hello ranney
son of a gun what are you doing here
enjoying myself immensely
his leg isnt even broken
hey doc what kind of nurses do
you have around here anyway
what goes on here ellen
when i came in here he was
lying there all covered up
he let me make an
absolute idiot of myself
rubbing his head both of them
the best cure in the
world for a hangover
ellen this is george jones an old
and untrustworthy friend of mine
now remember i saw her first
george jones
the name suits you perfectly
completely undistinguished
i wouldnt say that honey
some day you might wind up wearing it
well
shall we go
she cute
it pretty depressing have a
medical student for a room-mate
oh
he is always dissecting
something including me
you got to know what going on inside
if you expect to understand the outside
excuse me sir but you are wanted at
the hospital there is an emergency
oh rann im sorry
so am i
well back to the salt mines
see you folks later
not if i can help it
i intend to keep you to myself
for the rest of the afternoon
oh
and for the next two weeks
so
when a lonely prospector strikes gold
he doesnt yell for his friend
until he stakes a claim
how about some lunch
yes id love it
i dont like to make love
on an empty stomach
no neither do i
especially to a perfect stranger
why ellen wherever did you
get the idea that i was perfect
you
would you like to switch boxes
like we did when we were kids
naturally
youll love it
fried chicken potato salad
tomatoes cookies
k-rations canned ham
powdered milk chewing gum
and four cigarettes
coffee
so measly is that the best you can do
the best i can do with no ration card
oh
now if we were to combine forces
and pool our resources
i think we might do very well together
there we go
goodbye george and good luck
thanks for having me
goodbye darling
take care of yourself
ill be back honey
remember that ill be back
of course of course
and ill never let you go
goodbye darling
quite a guy
yeah quite a guy
im going to marry him rann
im going to marry him just
as soon as he gets back
i figured as much
are you sure he is right for you ellen
i dont know
it isnt something you think about
it just something you feel
you know
you cant do anything about it
i know what you mean ellen
a guy with wings has it all over us
fellows who walk around down here
im coming up now dear
do you want me to bring you anything
no
you alright
what is it what the matter
get a doctor
no no not that get a doctor
another doctor not grahame
but i have to dear he is your doctor
dont argue with me
dont call grahame get another doctor
yes alright
he didnt want the medicine
but i made him take it
good girl
still ticking
sounds pretty good
youre evidently feeling
better that when ellen called
what time is it
five after nine dear
it took you a long
time to get here ranney
i know it seems like it but he
came just as soon as i called him
how long did it take
about twenty minutes
fortunately ellen caught me
as i was leaving on another call
is there some alcohol about
yes
twenty minutes
i got that pain over forty-five
minutes ago why did you delay
i didnt dear
i lost a lot of time trying
to get another doctor
but you needed him so badly that
you know best
you always know best
nowadays dont you ellen
no it isnt that
i just knew that he would come
sooner than anyone else
he our friend george
youre much better already
ranney let not kid each other
we both know it my own insurance
company wouldnt put a nickel on me
now look here all of us
are in that same boat
an automobile taking an unexpected turn
a brick falling from a high building
a heart condition like yours
theyre all hazards but that doesnt
necessarily mean theyll never happen
think of all the chances
you took during the war
you didnt worry about them
you came out feeling better
than when you went in
now the only thing you have to do is lie
in bed and let us help you get well
isnt that right ellen
yes that what i keep telling him
you are lucky in many ways george
you have a wonderful wife
she developed into a fine nurse
i dont think ill be tying up her
exclusive services much longer
you must cut out this way of thinking
yeah i know i know
would you mind ellen
id like to talk to george alone
no of course not
ill be across the hall if you need me
those were pretty morbid things
you were saying in front of ellen
has she complained
certainly not
but you got to think of her too
she is looking a little worn
now when you get these ideas
try using a little mental therapy
next youll be telling me
i ought to see a psychiatrist
that might be a very good idea
you doctors are all alike
if you cant cure a patient
you tell him it all in his mind
im trying to help you george
you know that
ill drop in again this afternoon
maybe we can talk this thing out
yeah maybe we can
ellen
yes
ellen did anything particular happen
to upset george this morning
no not that i know of
why do you think he worse
frankly i dont like his mental state
i think maybe it just the hot weather
it depresses him
he been a very active man it
natural for him to be depressed but
yes
when a man is at a low ebb
mentally and physically
he prone all sorts of imaginary fears
yes i know
id feel better if he were
in hospital for a while
no no i dont think so
you want what best
for george dont you
well of course that just it
i think it would upset him terribly
you see he doesnt seem to want
anyone else around him except me
well this morning he didnt
even want me to call you
it isnt that he is disloyal rann
or he lost confidence but
lately he seems to have taken
these sudden dislikes to people
look ellen
you and george arent just
patients you are friends
george is up there
brooding and i dont like it
it could develop into something serious
if you wont send him to the hospital i
want you have someone here to help you
im sure you know what best rann
but honestly i dont know
how george will take it
he doesnt even seem to want
his aunt around anymore
ellen i dont think it is wise for you
to try to handle this alone any longer
youre stressed to the
breaking point already
ill take it up with
george this afternoon
id better get back upstairs
no ellen
let him relax for a while
alright
give the medicine a chance to work
yeah
i want you to relax too
remember now you can call
me any time you need me
even if you just think you need me
oh thanks
i dont know what id do sometimes
if i didnt remember that
goodbye
goodbye
youre doing fine
thanks
stay where you are dont move
oh you frightened me
did i
yes

work and more dangerous too
i took care of you didnt i

sorry dear i was talking to billy
i should say hoppy
let me change your pillow
you know the boy i told you about
who just moved in to the neighborhood
the one with the glasses you know
he an awful sweet little kid
what were you talking
to ranney graham about
that what im interested in
we were talking about you dear
he thinks you worry too
much about yourself
if i didnt i dont know who would
george
ever since you got out of bed
yesterday to see if you could walk
ive had it on my mind
i want you to promise me not get out
of bed again while im out of the room
alright ellen
did you
call the druggist about getting
the heat prescription filled
yes dear he said hed send
it up here later in the day
but there is enough there
if we need it before
did you tell them id spilled it
no i didnt do you feel
well enough for the paper
yeah
the editorial page
no just the front page
is alright thank you
here it is
you look tired ellen
im not
it just that it is so hot today
what are you thinking about ellen
well you know i was
i was just thinking that
everything in our lives
every breath every though
has been for ourselves
i dont think people can
do that and be happy
do you
youre getting a little
confused darling
it was me that ranney grahame
told to change my way of thinking
oh no i mean it was my fault too
i
i just wasnt strong enough to help you
but we could change all that now
it could make all the difference
in the world george
come here ellen
yes
what is the first thing you do
when
when i am out of this bed again
away from the house
ill just be so grateful
that you are well
i think i would
try to do something for somebody
i mean you
for your own self
id like children
yeah
and then id like a garden
a real garden
like the woman next door has
and id find out about
flowers and things
id compare notes with every
other woman on the block
so youd have a garden
and children huh
yes
isnt it good to plan again
it kinda gives you something
to hold on to doesnt it
oh my it takes a long time
for things to sink in doesnt it
you always said that you said make a
plan for anything and then stick to it
alright
alright our plan now
is for you to get well
and then afterwards
you must think im very stupid
stupid
dont you think i know
youre in love with him
in love with whom
grahame
why that the silliest
thing i ever heard of
you are not as subtle as
you think you are ellen
it quite obvious
at first i thought it was
just an infatuation
but now i realize it is more serious
serious in the way that my life is more
in danger from your heart than mine
george what are you talking about
i almost feel sorry for you ellen
he overrated you ellen
just as he underrated me
you havent the courage on the
intelligence he thinks you have
please dont talk like that
you suppose i dont know he told you to
rake over these old coals this morning
no he didnt
you convinced me i was a failure
by making me impossible promises
i know something about my own sickness
i know what happens to a man
when you take away his self-respect
i know what happens when
you constantly upset me
george this is wrong i know it is
please dont upset yourself any more
that what he told you to do isnt it
did he also tell you to delay getting
help to me like you did this morning
how could you do that ellen
how can you take a man of
second-rate intelligence like that
ill do anything you say
get another doctor
you didnt know what you
were in for did you ellen
please dont talk anymore
rest darling
oh george you just couldnt believe
those things you said about dr grahame
i dont even want to hear his name
leave it half way up ellen
i was so hurt i could
hardly keep from crying
again i reminded myself that george
was terribly ill and didnt mean it
i knew i had to keep doing
something anything
anything to keep me from
hearing george words
he didnt mean them
he couldnt mean them
it was his illness the heat
but when i took his lunch up to him
id be pleasant and cheerful
as if nothing had happened
hey
oh hi hoppy
shush
what the matter
you dont have to whisper now
he is awake
im just fixing his lunch
you come for your cookies
mummy says not to beg
but ive already had my lunch
youre not begging
i want to give you them
there you are take your choice
thank you
say

you sound just like my mom
no im not
oh
i got you something too
a present for me
uhuh
oh hoppy how nice
i wonder what this could be
that very nice of you
are you sure you dont
want to keep it yourself
we got a big television at home

well i know it is but it very nice
i want to thank you very
much for giving it to me
mummy says television is
good for when you are sick
daddy says it makes him sick

ill have to tell my husband about that

i can play with him if
he cant go outside
well that is very nice of you but
i dont think he is well
enough to see people dear
i wont make any noise
ill just eat my cookies and look

george you were out of bed
and you promised me you wouldnt

dear the postman said
he saw you at the window

well no he didnt
actually say he saw you
the postman has got
a touch of sunstroke
yeah me too i guess
that hot wind certainly
doesnt help much
you finished
yes very nice thank you
im glad you got that letter off
come over here ellen and sit down
would you like your aunt clara to
come up and visit for a little while
it pretty hot for the old girl
shed love it if you ask for her
you are the apple of her eye you know
i always was
you know
aunt clara gave me a
toy when i was a kid
a toy i was crazy about
my mother used to say she gave me too
much but i can still remember that toy
it was a
it was a bottle with a small absolutely
perfect sailing ship built inside of it
you know i was
i was so crazy about that toy i
wouldnt let anybody touch it
no
not even my mother
one day i was making a  garden
making a garden in the back yard
and a neighbor boy came running out
of my house with my ship in his hand
somehow i
got it away from him
without breaking it
i dont know what i said to him but
he looked awfully scared and white
and then i was frightened too thinking
he may have broken it the ship i mean
i picked up the little rake i had been
playing with and hit him with it
and where his face had been
so white it was all blood
i think i might have killed him
if mother hadnt come out
she took him in the house
to the bathroom and washed his face
they were both so excited but i felt
safe now i had my own little ship again
and when the neighbor boy stopped crying
mother turned to me and she said
give it to him
she sounded so strange
and quiet i knew i had to
he held out his hand i could see
he hadnt learned anything so i
i handed him the ship but just
as he was about to take it
i let it drop on the tiled
floor and i stepped on it
hed never have known what it was
but somehow or other it was mine
mine more than it had ever been before
i remembered every little
perfect thing about that ship
but to them it was just a mess of broken
glass and matchsticks on the floor
ellen
you know who that
neighbor boy looked like
he looked very much like grahame
and your dr grahame will find himself
in the same position as that little boy
but we are not going
to have him here again
but that doesnt change the fact youre
wrong about him he been fine to you
so thoughtful and given
you so much time
maybe that is because he
is a bachelor no home life
he been a good friend to us
our time is limited so
you must listen carefully
ranney grahame may have you alright
hell be disappointed with what he gets
george please
george i cant let you
talk this way anymore
ill fill this up
ill be downstairs if you want me
youd better wait ellen
ive written to the district attorney
asking him to make a full investigation
if anything happens to me today
before he can get help to me
why do you torture yourself like this
why do you imagine
things that dont exist
that letter exists
it proves you are trying to kill me
but im not
im not
if i cant help you george then i am
going to get someone else in who can
it not me that needs help now ellen
you gave that letter to the postman
yourself just a while ago
yes yes i gave him the letter the one
that you wrote about insurance policies
i knew you wouldnt recognise the
district attorney name if you saw it
nobody ever does isnt that strange
everybody knows he the district
attorney but nobody ever knows his name
we are going to get someone else in
another doctor
because this is all in your mind
my mind is fine
to reassure you on the point let say to
you that letter was about insurance
i told the district attorney how much
insurance we had on each other lives
if either of us died the other would
do very nicely for the rest of his life
or her life very comfortably indeed
oh
i also told them how you and
dr grahame how you
working together to aggravate my
condition so it wont look like murder
george
i also told him how you are
gradually giving me overdoses
of the heart medicine
but that isnt true
anyone would know that isnt true
would they
why is that bottle almost empty huh
we only got it the other day
well you
you told me you spilled it on the tray
you told me that yourself george
you didnt tell the druggist that
mr philips will make an excellent
witness against you ellen
hell be the first if anything happens
to me and let me say there are others
the letter takes care of everything
the druggist the medicine
the doctor he in it too
you have implicated your
old friend grahame you know
nothing is going to happen to you
i dont know if you are
doing this to frighten me
but im going to get the letter
back from the postman
you are not going
anyplace anymore ellen
because i am going to kill you
i decided that definitely this morning
you cant
you couldnt mean this george
you couldnt
george you know i
wouldnt hurt anybody
anybody much less you
george think it me
it ellen your darling
but you did want to be rid of me
it was in your mind that why
you feel so guilty isnt it
no
the letter will take care of grahame
i will take care of you myself
ill make it look like self-defence
please dont
there are just too many
things against you ellen
you used to say that you were
lonesome until you met me
george
george you love me
no ellen
i love you george
since ive been sick
since he been coming to the
house youve hated the sight of me
no i havent
no
no
it was one of those awful dreams
the kind i used to have
when george was overseas
that man lying there was george
my husband
he was dead
he died trying to kill me
telephone
telephone
hello  hello
hello
yes
mrs jones
yes who is it
mr philips down at the drugstore
what is it that you want mr philips
it about that heart
medicine you want refilled
yes
i cant refill it without
another prescription
i see
well just let it go
let it go
that is until i talk with dr grahame
oh
by the way according to my records you
got prescription filled the other day
but my husband knocked that bottle
over on the tray and spilled it
oh
you didnt tell me that
when you called before
but that what happened i promise you
that what happened mr philips
alright alright mrs jones
you dont have to promise anything
i didnt tell you before as i
didnt think it was necessary
you mean it wasnt
look here mrs jones
george said the mr philips would
be a witness against me
a witness
ill see that you get
another prescription
yes you just get in
touch with dr grahame
why didnt i tell him about george
the letter
i had to get that letter back
i couldnt tell anyone about
george until i got that letter back
i could feel the woman
next door watching
maybe shed be a
witness against me too
she could tell them how
i ran out of the house
and then back in again
how strangely i was acting
it wouldnt matter what she thought
if i could only get that letter back
then i tried to think
which way did he go
what that for tex
who knows
the engine needs everything
we can put in it
yeah but what will it do
who cares
pardon me
can you tell me did the
postman go by here yet
the postman
yeah
that old oddball found his way
through here a little while ago
oh which way did he go do you know
thataway
oh thanks
the way toward merritt street you know
yeah i know
oh im sorry
you know every time i go home
at night i always tell my wife laura
if it wasnt for that pension
plan i do id just never get up
id just drop in my tracks one of
these days and that would settle it
and id just never get up
anymore and that all
you know how it is
hello mr carson
see you later joe
see you later
well moss jones what are
you doing out this way
i was visiting a friend
oh that nice
i wish i had more time for visitors
but by the time i get home at night i
can just hardly make it up the stairs
mr carston remember that
letter i gave you this morning
i suppose so i pick up plenty
of letters why what about it
well i know it seems silly but i
i mailed it by mistake
it wasnt even finished yes
what did you do that for
i dont know i guess
i was just so busy i
finish it up and mail the rest tomorrow
theyll get it in two instalments
you wouldnt want me to do that
may i have the letter please
so i pick them up and carry them around
for miles and then they want them back
well im sorry but you
can understand why
i wouldnt want it to go out unfinished
yeah i guess so
but all these delays count keep me
on my feet longer than i ought to
it wont be much trouble will it
here here it is
thank you
now look you shouldnt have given
me this letter in the first place
why
giving me this letter is just
like putting it in a mailbox
now you wouldnt expect to get this
back from the mailbox would you
no but surely you can make
this exception after all i
isnt this fellow the district attorney
yes
yes my husband read about
some graft in the newspaper
and wrote to the district
attorney about it
oh your husband wrote the letter
yes
i thought you said you wrote it
well what the difference
he is my husband
it makes all the difference
in the world mrs jones
but why
it one of our strictest rules
we cant return a letter to anyone
except the person who wrote it
but mr carston my husband
is sick you know that
and he sent me to get the letter back
yes i know that
dont be so obstinate
you know it alright
he sick give it to me
obstinate now how do you like that
after standing here patiently in all
this heat trying to reason with you
you are the one being obstinate and
dont realise it against the rules
what do you care if
it against the rules
i have to care but you dont
you are not the one whod get fired
im sorry
im very sorry mr carston
i forgot what it means to you
your responsibility
it must be this terrible heat
please
i know how anxious my husband
is to get that letter back
it was my fault you see
i mailed it by mistake
he awfully with me he is
very angry with me mr carston
couldnt you please help me
couldnt i please have the letter back
well i tell you what ill do
yes
im all through with the route
until this afternoon delivery
since it is so important like you say
oh it is
if you give me a lift to town in your
car so i wont lose any more time
i will
ill go to your house with you now and
give the letter to mr jones personally
no you cant
but mrs jones
this way ill be sticking to the rules
and your husband gets his letter back
but my husband didnt sleep last night
and he fell asleep just before i left
and i wouldnt want to wake him
im trying to do the right thing
by everybody concerned
it seems you cannot cooperate im not
risking losing my job for anybody
try to understand
i cant talk about it any longer
i cant waste more time
do you want me to take the letter to
your husband personally or dont you
no
alright then ill take it to the
post office like im supposed to
you can go down there and
get it from the superintendent
superintendent
yeah
he has more authority than i have
maybe hell give it to you
i see
youd better not waste any more time
once i bring the mail in
they send it out right quick
once it leaves the post office
for delivery nobody can stop it
the post office downtown
yep
thanks oh mr carston
how do i get there
the shortest way i mean
right down the boulevard
is the shortest cant miss it
thanks how much time do i have
about 230 maybe a little over 4
thank you
ellen
ellen
pardon me
yes
have you seen mrs jones this morning
yes she went out about a half hour ago
went out
yes
but what about george mr jones
she hasnt gone off and
left him alone has she
well
her husband is sick you know
so ive heard
if course i never really met them
though i havent lived here long
i cant imagine her going off like that
im mr jones aunt i made him some
jelly consomm i packed it in ice
it melting
i never dreamt i wouldnt get in
i could tell you where the key is
key
perhaps you think it nosy but i did
see her when she locked the door
well isnt that good of you
the front door
yes
right over there above the door
thank you
i dont know how you stand
it in the sun without a hat on
you might dry up like a prune
the top of the green shutter
the far side of the door
ive found it
if there is anything i can
do for you just call me
you are very kind thank you
aunt clara
ellen where on earth have you been
have you been upstairs
i was just going up
why are you so out of breath
why
ive been running
running in all this heat
you should have more sense
how did you get in aunt clara
i found the key on the ledge
there look at that
slipped right down my dress
now it ruined
i was worried half to death
i thought something had happened
ive never known you
to go out like this
how is george
he alright
i even rang the bell just a jab
did he take one of those sedatives
yes
people take too much medicine
nowadays if you ask me
when i was a girl we
had homeopathic doctors
i wonder what happened to them
anyway they gave very little medicine
and it all tasted good even the tonics
and no promises at all
ellen ive never seen you
look so tired and worn out
why not ask that doctor
to give you something
im alright
he looks too young to
me to be a good doctor
but after all if you and
george like him so much
confidence is half the battle
you look awful peaky
ellen you are not letting
yourself go are you
no i know i look terrible
look when george fell asleep i
i had some errands to do
ill get you some
i just thought i would go and
take care of them without
bothering to change
you know how it is
sure you are alright
yes
why not go upstairs and lie down for a
bit take a snooze it will do you good
im not tired really im not
well after all
clara i have so much to do today
do sit down ellen
lean back relax
youll be on your back before you
know it if you dont watch out
after all all i want to do is to help
from now on im going
to have more time too
ellen i forgot to tell you
i resigned
resigned
from the helper guild after fifteen
years im not helping anymore
i will
ill leave the kitchen door open and we
can talk as i clean out there alright
you might as well youre so fidgety
oh ellen while you are on your
feet will you bring me a dishcloth
for fifteen years i was in that guild
and for the past five i was treasurer
and for the last three they were
promising me the presidency
so what happens
last tuesday they elect paula comstock
you know zachary wife
well i was furious
zachary said i was hasty
but after fifteen years
you know ive never known
a small woman yet
who wasnt always boasting about
her little hands and tiny feet
and trying to run everything
that the best i can do
do you think i was right
fifteen years after all
zachary was upset he says i
need lots of outside activity lots
and i agreed with him
i thought if she
didnt stop id scream
i always tell him he plays
too much at his age
that just one of the worries of
being married to an older man
ellen why dont you have
some of that jelly consomm
at least it was jelly when i left home
try it it tasty and full of vitamins
id like someone to enjoy it
after all it ruined my dress
i think ill run up
and pop in on george
if he is asleep you can tell
him later that i peeped in
aunt clara aunt clara
what is it darling
there is something i must tell you
what is it dear what is the matter
i
are you having trouble
yes
i didnt want to tell you
but now i think i must
dont
take my advice and dont you will
only be sorry later that you did
i thought it was funny
you being out like that
and not going up to see
george when you came in
but you dont understand
oh yes i understand
ill just say goodbye to him
no please dont
i didnt want to tell you this but
george said that the last time you came
to see him you upset him terribly
and he said to tell you that if you came
again today to tell you that he just
couldnt see you
upset him
you must remember he is ill
upset him
ive a good mind to tell him something
no please
no i wouldnt think
of humiliating myself
he knew i was here all the time
well he was rude and selfish
even before he was sick
and he is rude and selfish
since he been sick
sorry i had to tell you this
i thought when i first met you youd do
something for him change him somehow
but i must say he hasnt changed at all
he is worse if anything and ellen
you can tell george from me
that a man wrapped up in himself
makes a very small package
i wondered how much time i had
she was right i must look awful
i had to fix myself up before
i could go to the post office
i had to go in there
i was terrified but i knew i had to
george
he was dead
i mustnt let myself think about it
i mustnt think about anything
anything until i get that letter back
that letter that said i killed him
maybe it was a dream
no it wasnt
i must fix my face
i must look presentable
like any other housewife making
a simple request for a letter
a letter that was mailed by mistake
the gun
it was still in george hand
somehow i knew i
shouldnt leave it there
gunshot
bang-bang bang-bang
come down will you
ill take care of them for you
it alright hoppy
it was the radio i just turned it off
need any help
no
no everything is alright
i see it
bang bang bang bang
bang got you
i prayed that no-one
else had heard that shot
doorbell
i thought perhaps if i didnt answer
hed think no-one was home and go away
but he didnt
he just rang the bell again
and then stood there
doorbell
then i knew i had to get rid of him
yes
good afternoon im mr russell
yes
id like to see mr jones
he is expecting me
expecting you
yes
he telephoned me the other day
well there must be some mistake
my husband is not well
he isnt able to leave his bed
he told me he was ill but he did
telephone to be here this afternoon
well nevertheless he isnt
well enough to see anyone
it a business matter mrs jones
im sorry
but the doctor has forbade
him to see anyone
he warned me that i would get
some resistance from you
he did
he explained that you were over
solicitous about his health
but that i wasnt to take you seriously
oh
your husband only wants me to
authenticate some legal papers
i am a notary
it wont take but a few minutes
sorry i told you he isnt very well
he had a relapse
the doctor just left
here a few minutes ago
and he said he wasnt able to
see anyone today not anyone
sorry to have bothered you miss jones
oh that alright
i will leave my card
perhaps youll call me when he better
yes yes ill call you
good afternoon
goodbye
could he be another witness
i couldnt think what id said to him
i would have to be more careful
suddenly i remembered
what happened the last time
i had to be sure no-one
could get into the house
here i come here i come
hi
i beat you to the crossing didnt i
billy
where are you going
are you alright
sure can i go with you
no you cant
im sorry im late
for heaven sake be more careful
dont you ever do a thing like
that again you hear me
okay
my horse ate the bowl of cookies
well ill give you some more later on
m & m
yes m & m
you stay right there in that driveway
until i get out you understand
okay
all i remember about the
drive down town was
i kept thinking
this time i must control myself
i must keep calm
we caught it in plenty
of time mrs jones
it was brought in just a little while
ago and wasnt even processed yet
then i can have it now
of course
thank heavens
i am glad we caught in time for you
my husband will be so
pleased to have it back
ill give you one of our
regular forms here
a form
yes one of these
oh
you mean i cant take
the letter with me now
just take the form home to mr jones
have him fill it out and
when you bring it back ill have the
letter here and i can give it to you
look
but why is that necessary
just regulations
among other things it gives me time
to compare mr jones handwriting
with the writing on the envelope
i can assure you it is my
husband handwriting
im sure it is
yes
but i must have one of
those forms for my records
oh
but
but my husband has been very ill
and everything bothers him
and if i dont have this letter for him
when i go home hell be awfully upset
why should he
well you see
i am afraid that
he said a lot of very
strong things and
he regrets them now
you can explain to him
that it wont be delivered
itll be held here until
the form comes back
yes but it is so hard to reason
with a person who is ill
well you know how it is
they exaggerate the
importance of everything
and what with his heart condition
i wouldnt want to take a chance
really i must have the letter
for him when i go home now
i must
mrs jones i think i can take a chance
ill let you fill out the
form for your husband
that very nice of you
on one condition
i of course must make sure
of the contents of the letter
what do you mean
it will be strictly confidential but
the letter must be opened and read
open the letter
yes to make sure that it is the letter
to the district attorney as you say
no you cant
i wont have anyone prying
into my husband mail
prying
i want that letter back
do you understand
unopened
mrs jones i was about to tell
you if youd let me finish
that i would call your husband for you
explain the issue and ask his permission
for you to open the letter not me
im sorry
im very sorry
i didnt mean to say that
but you dont seem to understand
no i dont understand mrs jones
and i have no alternative but to send
the letter on to the distributing room
good day
mrs jones
mrs jones
i dont want to intrude
but i couldnt help
noticing you all day long
ive had the feeling that you
that something was wrong
and i would so like
to be able to help you
i know we havent been too neighborly
but trouble is something else again
can i help you
is there something i can do for you
of course i know you are anxious
to get up to your husband
so you run up and see if he
is comfortable and settled
then you come over
or call me
ill be waiting for you
she was kind
she might have been my friend
she might have helped me
then i remembered rann
he said he was going to
stop in again to see george
i couldnt let him do that
he mustnt come here again
ever
dr grahame office
hello this is mrs jones
is dr grahame there
he isnt here mrs jones
can you locate him please it urgent
if it an emergency i could
trace him through his house calls
please do
it is very important that dr grahame
doesnt come here today
i hope you understand
of course i will do my best goodbye
goodbye
doorbell
doctor i just called your
office and told the nurse
what is it
well
george told me he wanted
to consult another doctor
and i did too and he just left and
and i really think it would be better
if you didnt see him again today
oh
what doctor did you call
oh
im sorry i have forgotten his name
i called a neighbor for her doctor and
she gave me his phone number and
george liked him very much
yes
is he a heart specialist
yes yes
that is i think so
what was his diagnosis
i dont know
really george feels much
better ill call you tomorrow
now wait a minute
what happened really
well you see
after
no no please dont please
dont go up there it better for
everybody if you just dont go up there
ellen
it
is he dead
yes
yes
he had a gun
he tried to kill me but
before i could shoot he
he
take it easy
and so i took the gun out of
his hand and then i hid it
i had to it looked as though he had
died protecting himself from me
alright ellen but why
didnt you want me here
i dont know how to tell you
that letter said that we
planned his death together
that you told me to
aggravate his condition
to give him overdoses
of his heart medicine
and if they come here
and find you here
theyll think it true
just as george said
ellen his mind was going
i tried to tell you this morning
he wasnt responsible
they wont believe me
how could they
i did everything wrong everything
just like he said i would
the druggist and then the postman
and then the superintendent
i even lied to his aunt
theyll think i was guilty all of them
you are not guilty ellen
remember that
i know
the police will be here any minute
youd better go better go right now
doorbell
ellen where are you going
i dont know
there is no sense in running
away now go to the door
ellen
go to the door
hello mrs jones
i got a letter for you this afternoon
i didnt put it in the slot because
what
i guess i should feel kinda
funny coming here like this
after what happened between
you and me this noon
but it is alright i understand
here is the letter you gave
me to mail this morning
what
a surprise
i didnt realise it at first
a thick letter like that
and only one stamp
those public officials like the district
attorney wont accept postage-due mail
insufficient postage
yeah the other end just wont
pay the postage in these cases
and we have to return them to
the senders how do you like that
not enough postage and we
have to deliver them twice
yes
a crazy business
you know some folks
might think im stingy
i know these extra stamps
cost only just a few cents but
yes i understand
the same for you as everybody else
yes i understand it
thanks again for the letter mr carston
that alright goodbye
thanks again mr carston for bringing it
youre welcome
0h  it is so funny
go ahead it will do you good
you know i
i tried so hard
so hard to get it back
it alright ellen
you got it now
and then i knew what people meant
when they said their heart was broken
all that was left of george
and me and our marriage
was that little pile of ashes
i knew that some way or somehow
i would have to begin to live again
but right then
all i could do was pray
to lose that one day
that one terrifying day
-s-d-

eddie
the prowler
standard weapons complement
includes one recoilless rifle
two mark-9 grenade launchers
and twin 50-caliber machine guns
i have sufficient firepower
to neutralize
a wide variety
of security threats
as you can see this lightweight
handheld control unit enables you
to direct my movements
while simultaneously operating
the various weapons systems
in manual or full-automatic mode
in full-automatic mode my infrared
heat sensors and doppler radar
mean that i am able to acquire
moving targets at night
without assistance
from the operator
that concludes
the program demonstration
now our factory representative
will discuss the features
of the simplified mark-2
handheld control system
after the gyros are locked
any movement of the hand controller
is duplicated by the prowler
the simple control system means even
semiskilled employees can operate--
he talking about you cusack
so pay attention
youve all got to qualify on this
it the future
as they say
even a child can operate it
youre looking at the perfect cop
the damn thing follows orders
another gun without a brain
the machine guns can be linked to
the laser range and guidance system
for target orientation
if the commander would like
to pick someone to elude prowler
ill show you
our target acquisition system
halt police
throw down your weapon
we will not harm you please place
your hands above your head
drop it
you are under arrest
please do not resist
thank you for your cooperation

-----NewMovie-----
﻿
drop your rifle
get your hands up over your head
well so youve come
to thank me stranger
that one way of putting it
but im a curious man mister
before i thank you id like to know
what you got against me
why nothing son
nothing at all
then why did you shoot at me
instead of the comanches
id call that a mighty fair question
you mind if i put my arm down son
i got a bad shoulder
just dont go reaching
for any iron huh
well you might put it onto the head
in the military strategy son
you see comanches sometimes
get queer notions
they figure that land back there
is kind of sacred
as long as you was trespassing
you were safe
i was just trying to coax you
back onto sacred territory
so that why they kept
changing their minds
im afraid i owe you
my sincere apology sir
and my thanks
ah there was no real danger
there only ten of them
and i still got one good arm left
mind if i have a look at this one
yeah
this is right friendly
of you stranger
looks as though
the comanches got to you
before they got to me
there was no comanches
comanches is real friendly people
if you dont rub them the wrong way
let just say it a snake bite
seems as though the snake
left a little bit of lead in there
only one kind of snake
around these parts
ill get it out
as quick and easy as i can
there no hurry son
only dont throw it away
i like to save
the lead folks take out of me
i got me three pounds of it
i reckon that there is supposed to be
one of them bowie knives
that exactly what it is
that is exactly what it aint
that the poorest imitation
of the genuine article as ever i seen
it is
yessiree
that one is the same
as thousands of others
folks are selling back east
a real bowie knife
that something else again
id ought to know
i gave jim bowie the idea
for that weapon myself
that mighty interesting
yessiree it was back in louisiana
me and jim were sitting
on the front porch whipping
jim was a rich man in them days
it was on account that id given him
the idea there plenty
of money in sugar
no time at all jim had cleaned up
three million dollars
two million
you a friend of jim bowie
not particularly
hmm
well anyways jim
i says omeday im gonna fashion me
a hunting knife 6 inches long
and curved in the end
like a heathen
scimitar
that right scimitar
o as my hand wont slip i says
aimed to put cross guard on the hilt
and im going to put a double edge
on the last three inches
four inches
next thing i knowed
jim bowie had beat me to it
and made the knife his self
i dont think i quite
got your name son
james bowie of louisiana
oh while you was talking
i was beginning to think--
james bowie
why ill be hog swallowed
and whom do i have
the pleasure of digging into
dani seeger
dani gideon seeger
ex-hunter ex-indian fighter
ex-congressman and as you have
probably figured out
the biggest hogtied jugheaded
turnip sucking liar in the whole world
steady now dani
i think i got it
i find this mighty interesting jim
them bucks out there
come galloping by
and see how close they can come to us
with their arrows
and they try again 0 paces further on
and so on
it that so on that bothers me
well i wish you were still
a member of congress dani
this seems the most appropriate time
to register a complaint
i call that mighty fair shooting
you take shoshones jim
theyre a bit nearsighted for indians
now if them were shoshones
instead of comanches
id be getting a little nervous
how many rounds do these
games usually run
three is about average
four rounds is extra good
if it should happen to run up to five
well them bucks would be
talking about nothing else
for weeks to come
that nice to know
well in case theyre only
playing a three rounder
it was mighty nice meeting up
with you jim bowie
excuse the left hand dani
it been a nice friendship
if a short one
yeah me unconscious
most of the time
look yonder jim
it quisima the number one chief
id seen him once in washington
he the one i came out here to see
does he understand english
i dont know
so this is the mighty quisima
who sat in the council of the white man
in washington
this is quisima
who gave one hand in friendship
to his white brothers
while the other hand held a knife
this is quisima
whose word is shifting as the wind
whose tongue twists like a river
of many branches
this is quisima breaker of treaties
today the comanche
is held in honor and respect
like the mountain that never yields
or the sun that never changes
tomorrow you will be
driven off like a dog
that wanders close to a campfire
to take his place among men
white men broke treaty
went where forbidden to go
he a stranger in these parts
your men shouldve come
to him friendly-like
and told him he was trespassing
on sacred ground
instead of swooping down on him
like chicken hawks trying to kill him
i come from the land of the naches
in the muscogeean to sit in council
with the mighty quisima
if i did not come in friendship
your three braves would now lie dead
comanche honors his treaties
hope my white brothers do same
when time comes
one white brother hurt
comanche medicine man
make him well again
meantime white man
whose tongue is as sharp as his blade
will teach quisima
more about his knife
james bowie
if i had your gift of speeching
id still be in congress
it all right jim
my arm being as good as new
we are pulling out tomorrow
well quisima ive kept
my part of the bargain
in the two weeks weve
been here ive taught your men
how to make and fight
with my kind of knife
a blade that cuts two ways
has kept his word
quisima will keep his
when treaty with white man is renewed
bowie brother of quisima
may dig silver ore
that lies beneath land of comanches
and the comanches will get
a good price for it
as long as campfires burn
before the tents of comanches
the blade that cuts two ways
and his friends will be welcome
i aint aiming to pry
into your private affairs jim
but that silver deal
you made with quisima
youre not prying danl
since the war of 82
the country been trying
to get back on its feet
we need that silver to help us do it
that why i came out here
i hate to disappoint you jim
but that treaty aint
being renewed next week
youre mistaken
the renewal was drawn up
when i left the east
oh it was drawn up all right
but andy jackson gave it
to a dimwit named dani seeger
to give to the comanches
for ratification
well then what wrong
remember that bullet
you took out of my shoulder
well a short while
before i run into you
i was dragged and thieved
the ornery skunks
took the treaty renewal
but the president can always
send the comanches another copy
yeah but itll be
weeks before they get here
meanwhile folks are pouring
into the territory
by the dozens just waiting
for the treaty to expire
comes the deadline
they all will be staking claim
once they get in here
it aint gonna be as easy
to get out of here
any idea who might have done it
nope but im hoping
i might find out something
when we get to crooked tongue
dont your remember anything
as a matter of fact
there was something jim
just before i passed out
i got a whiff of fancy perfume
perfume
perfume
smelled real good too
for a minute
i thought i was getting mighty
too close to the pearly gates
do you know what kind it was
no but id recollect it
if i ever ran cross it again
i may not have good brains
but i sure got a good smeller
dani and i have been
doing some tall thinking
along the way
whoever took that treaty
knows for certain
therell be no renewal next week
that follows
so naturally youll expect
to have a lot of silver
to sell in the near future
well seems logical
well im gonna spread it
around town
i came out here to buy silver
all i can lay my hands on
now why couldnt i have thunk of that
the best way to get polecats
is to smoke them out
anybody who ready
to make a deal with you
knows more than he had ought to
precisely
and since youre
evidently known by sight
i suggest we ride into town alone hmm
as we used to say in congress
the motion is seconded and passed
and the meeting is adjourned
come on you cow-heels
now put your money down
boozer here will take all bets
your money or your livestock
but just see that you make it big
with our luck
im not gonna make this ride
unless you fellas
make it worth my while
now let me get this straight katie
youre betting you can
take that tray in one hand
and ride full gallop
to the end of town
stop dead ride back at full speed
return the tray
and if one of the glasses is spilled
ive lost my bet
katie youve just made
yourself a wager
do you call that a wager
take that trash out of my sight
i dont aim to be insulted
by small bets like that
well come on some man-sized bets
or im not going to trouble myself
all right
there you are
that more i like it
come on now come on
$4 keep going
come on now come on
all right
come on now let him do it come on
come on put your hands over here
come on katie come on katie
get away folks
go on hanging right on to it
there
now yall set katie
all set
good lord there we go
now easy does it
easy does it
dont spill it i got my money on it
you clumsy ox
im terribly sorry
blundering fool
now now miss i said i was sorry
it not nice for a lady
not to be a lady
sorry
he said he sorry
you blundering tinhorn
you made me lose all my bets
bets
i didnt know ladies made bets
you call me a lady once more
and ill fill you full of lead
easy now miss the mood youre in
youre liable to pull that trigger
thereby causing
a most embarrassing situation
for both of us
you did that on purpose
look mister if the lady wants
to pull a gun on me
that quite all right
where i come from
we usually let the ladies
have their way
but i dont like a man doing it
oh you dont now im gonna shoot
you get out of this
but miss katie
i bet my whole bankroll on you
i can take care of this
this tinhorn without your help
ive got an idea
why dont you two toss a coin
to see who shoots me huh
you talk too much
all right mister
draw
i said draw
sorry maam back in louisiana
when we meet any pretty ladies
we make love to them
we kiss them
spank them on occasion
but we never go around shooting them
are you going to draw or arent you
of all the yellow spineless
cowardly coyotes i
pay off all bets
another thing i forgot to mention
i dislike the sound of someone
cocking a pistol behind my back
hello
howdy
id like to deposit this bank draft
and draw some cash against it
oh sure sure
hmm $5000
you have to take this up with the boss
in there
it all right go right in
well
look miss im liable
to run out of apologies
if youre following me around
to start trouble again
what do you want to see me about
i can assure you miss
seeing you was the least
of my intentions
im waiting to see
the president of the bank
all right
start talking
youre not the bank president
mister i am the bank and im busy
now what do you want
id like to deposit this draft
and draw some cash against it
james bowie louisiana
and now you got the better of me
i usually like to know
the names of people
i do business with
the name kathryn howard
and were not doing any business
do you mean youre not going
to honor this draft
that exactly what i do mean
i dont like the look of it
meaning you dont like me
suit yourself
i dont like you mister
or your bank draft
but there isnt another bank
within 200 miles
im considered a fairly
wealthy man back east
but if you refuse to cash this draft
i might as well be broke
now it does seem to work out
that way doesnt it
thanks for dropping in mr bowie
but this is ridiculous
this is a perfectly legal bank draft
you cant refuse to recognize
the bank of louisiana
i refuse to recognize
the whole state of louisiana
ms howard ive done
a lot of things in my life
but ive never had
a bank president across my knee
for a good spanking
that a pleasure
i shall look forward to
if you refuse to accept this draft
im sure the gambling casino next door
will be very glad to
mr bowie
let me give you
some friendly advice
get out of town youve already
been here too long
very kind of you
to want to be my friend
thank you
we must have dinner together sometime
jack good
how about you
eight
seven
four
who in charge around here
stacey
that him at the end of the bar
how about you
yeah
excuse me they tell me
youre in charge around here
that right
id like to cash a draft
drawn on the bank of louisiana
certainly how large
five thousand
you know that size
you have to take it up
with the big boss
and where do i find the big boss
in the office
oh no
it you again
get to the point mister
this happens to be one of my busy days
now what can i do for you
oh ive seen everything
i have no time for small talk
mr bowie
but if this is a social call i--
no not at all
ms howard i have in my possession
a draft drawn on the bank--
oh what the use
look i need cash
ill make you a sporting proposition
im not a gambler
but evidently you are
one cut of the cards for five thousand
youve made yourself a bet mr bowie
come on
were breaking in for one hand
of high card slim
that all boys pick up your chips
give me 5000
five thousand one hand
you ask too many questions
cash if you dont mind
mind if i have a look at those cards
why you little
that all right slim
mr bowie has a peculiar
sense of humor
why dont you shuffle them too
well it not necessary
after all we do trust
each other dont we
ladies first
oh i forgot you dont like
to be called a lady
or dress like one either
an eight
four
your money mr bowie
i believe i mentioned before
i dont gamble ms howard
you can have the draft
thatll keep it from being gambling
now look mr bowie if that a bet
i dont think you meant that
to be an insult or did you
i never insult anyone with $5000
especially a lady
whatll it be
thatll be all right
any kind of will do
jim ive have smelled
half the people in town
and believe me there are no lilies
ive smelled polecat and sheepherder
and about a dozen assorted smells
i havent classified as yet
any trace of that perfume
not a whiff but ill keep on smelling
until my smeller gives up
im sorry you had trouble
with the boss
if shed known who jim bowie was
im sure she would have been
more courteous
i cant imagine that female tiger
if she is a female
being courteous
under any circumstances
oh katie really
a nice person mr bowie
when you get to know her better
getting to know her better
is one ordeal
im hoping to spare myself
can i buy you a drink
thanks
boozer
so far all the friends
ive made in this town
add up to zero
well your entrance into town
wasnt exactly conducive
to making friends
you know i spent most
of my life in the east
that where i first heard of jim bowie
and his fabulous knife
i hear tell it a deadly man killer
it a hunting knife
sorry
youre in sugar arent you
used to be
we dont grow much sugar
in these parts
no but i understand
youre expecting a fine
crop of silver very soon
thinking of staking your claim
in comanche territory
im leaving the claim taking to others
im buying silver all i can get
that very interesting mr bowie
if i hear of anyone
with silver to sell
ill pass the word along
well if it aint ms katie howard
lucky for you lem
i cant tote any guns in this outfit
what are you rigged up for katie
a wedding or a funeral
wait until you see the dress
i wear the day we bury you
all right boys
when katie goes feminine
somebody better watch out
still wondering if the tiger is female
not anymore
im raising 0 more
no bet
what the idea
i thought i told you card sharks
to keep out of my place
now get
but i--
go on
mighty affectionate for a man your age
it aint affection it that perfume
well if it going
to affect people like that
i better not use it anymore
all right miss where is the treaty
treaty
the treaty with the comanches
the one you took from me
what have you done with it
i dont know what youre talking about
that treaty was a property
of the federal government
and i aim to get it back
im sorry ms katie
why you clumsy mutt
hey someone get me out of here
someone get me out of here
i promised myself this
pleasure ms bank president
ow
that for not cashing
my draft
ill kill you when i get out of here
ow
that for giving me so much trouble
throw these two gentlemen out of here
well i hope you know
what youre doing
you bet i do
you know people dont toss
jim bowie around like that
and get away with it
ill take my chances
whoever he is
for your information
he a very wealthy man
he in town to buy silver
so what
a comanche silver is no good
to us if we dont get someone
to take it off our hands
therell be other buyers
sure maybe in a few months
but we can use jim bowie now
if you dont want all our plans
to fall through
youd better go after him
see if you can repair
the damage youve done
me go crawling to him
id rather die first
im not asking you katie
im telling you
eh it no use jim
ill never learn to keep my mouth shut
if i had id still be in congress
you never struck me as the kind of man
that goes around kissing strange girls
in the shoulder
and in one drink too
i wasnt kissing i was whiffing
and i got me a nose
full of that perfume
ms howard
uh-hmm
instead of saying nothing
playing possum
i had to raise a fuss
and get us thrown out
now we cant get back in there
to snoop around
im not so sure of that danl
i came out to tell you
that i was sorry
i want to apologize
well this is a surprise
it is to me too
i mean we try to run
a respectable place
and if your friend here
hadnt started all the trouble--
he no friend of mine
i never saw him before
well you were trying to help him
just a case of helping the underdog
too many against one
i reckon i could take the blame
for that little fracas miss
you see i met up with
an accident awhile back
and ive been kind of
getting funny spells ever since
you know imagining
all sorts of funny things
im sorry if i caused you
any trouble stranger
um i hope we can consider all this
a misunderstanding mr bowie
im sure that all it was ms howard
oh that very kind of you to say so
if youre not holding any grudges
i--id like to offer you a drink
well the offer is gratefully accepted
providing of course
im still welcome inside
oh of course mr bowie
and again
my deepest apologies
not at all ms howard
my apologies to you
oh
well ill be
hogswalled
how about this table mr bowie
splendid
you can see everything from here
and nobody can get behind me
oh now mr bowie
boozer
see that mr bowie
has anything he wants
but ms katie i think he just a--
youre not paid to think
mr bowie is a guest of mine
give him the best in the house
oh by the way
have you made any arrangements
for your lodgings
no not yet
well then it all settled
youll stay at my ranch
that very gracious of you
ms howard
oh not at all mr bowie
you know i had no idea
stacey was your brother
you didnt
he told me when i got to
know you better
id get to like you
and i believe he was right
oh
so in two days you think
youre beginning to know me
at least im beginning to like you
oh
come
i thought the comanche
had a peace treaty
with his white brothers
come
it seems that his entire vocabulary
i think we better go with him
why are we brought here like this
quisima breaks his word
to keep the peace
with the white man
quisima keeps his word
want to know if white men
will keep theirs
a blade that cuts two ways
will sit in council
of comanches
pakanah
this is pakanah
my son
he lived with white man
he tell you when your tongue message
is given to us
white man like bird
that makes sweet music
but rob nest of others
he promised comanche peace
while hand reaches for a gun
to slay him
every day
we see white man
come across plain
from direction of morning sun
he bring tools with him
not for planting of corn
but for digging of silver
white man
plan to betray comanche
he will take his land
there will be no new treaty
each day comanche wait
white man becomes stronger
comanche must strike
at once tonight
council agrees with pakanah
but i told them
my brother bowie
man of honor
he not lie
if he tell me
white man renew treaty
quisima believe him
what do you think ms howard
i
i dont know
i pledge my word of honor quisima
that the treaty
has already been renewed
and has been sent on its way here
from washington
white man has false tongue
i dont blame you
for being angry pakanah
but i dont like to be called a liar
white man lie
i make him admit
if that the way you want it
not with your weapons
with ours
each to his own
please dont
you wont stand a chance
then why dont you stop it
you know there a new treaty
and you know who took it
i cant
then ive got to fight him
or every comanche in the territory
will be on the warpath before morning
i wish youd change your mind pakanah
i dont wanna kill you
i want kill you
i told the truth
i told the truth
white man tell truth
you think i want that silver
for myself dont you
well youre wrong
i have my reasons good reasons
but they wouldnt mean anything to you
maybe they would
not to an easterner
you would have to be a part of that
to understand
and that would have to be
a part of you
my father and grandfather
came out here to try
and make something
out of that wilderness
and they died trying
they brought
all their friends with them
and everyone whod listen
go on
but things didnt work out
the way they expected them
they raised cattle
but there was no way to get them
to the eastern markets
people began to get discouraged
lately things have been getting worse
a lot of families have left
the territory and gone back
and you think that comanche silver
will keep them from leaving
is that it
yes that it
once they stake claims
theyd have to stay here
and no one the indians
and the federal government included
is going to stop us
that mighty big talk ms howard
well that the way
we feel about it all of us
even my brother stacey
of all the upside down
back into
mule-headed illogical
irrational feminine reasoning
you saw the mood
those comanches are in
do you think for one moment
the shooting stop
with that one rifle ball i took out
of dani seeger shoulder
im sorry about that
there wasnt supposed to be a shooting
but the men with me
were pretty desperate
somebody slipped up
and theyll slip up again
if they try to jump indian land
quisima has already given
the government permission
to dig for their silver
that mighty fine for the government
but it doesnt do us any good
listen ms howard
your desire to improve this territory
is most commendable
but youre going about it
in the wrong way
dont you understand
the country needs this silver
theyll make a road out here
wagon trains will be rolling
in and out of here
people who left will be coming back
and hundreds more
besides this territory
will be bigger than anything
your father or grandfather
ever dreamed of
you really believe that
believe that i know it
so youre calling off the deal katie
all our plans
everything weve worked for
not unless you agree stacey
after all that your problem
as much as mine
oh anything you say
is all right with me
you know that
since we only have three days left
i suggest we get the treaty to quisima
as quickly as possible
i didnt know thered would be
a change in plans
i destroyed it
im sorry
well no harm done
you two confess the word out
that there is a new treaty
and nobody is to try moving in
on the comanches
thatll protect us till andy jackson
can send along a new copy
yeah im afraid that wont work jim
a lot of newcomers pulled up stakes
and came out here just to get in
on the silver rush
theyre not gonna be
in a listening mood
i found out when i was in
business back east
that usually the best way
to handle a stubborn customer
was to get a couple of drinks
and a good meal under his belt
then hed usually listen to reason
were gonna throw the biggest shindig
this territory ever known
wed throw the cafe wide open
and wine them and dine them
until theyre ready to listen
and just in case a few of them
dont see the light
i suggest we take their guns away
before they come in
what the matter tom
comanches making trouble
heck no get down
to crooked tongue today
free fills and plenty of liquor
katie howard throwing a shindig
you better hurry
yeah
i guess i better get home
and change my duds
come on
hey stop everything
katie howard throwing a party
free fills and liquor for everybody
are you sure there aint no
charge for this
everything is free
well in that case thanks
here now
we dont have none of that
i like your neighbors katie
theyre nice friendly people
i sure hope they stay that way
after we bust the news to them
well i dont expect any trouble
with the old timers
but there a lot of newcomers
around here
that ive never seen before
hello jed
oh excuse me
hello sue hello jed
hello
im sure glad you could make it
i wouldnt miss this on a bet katie
what all this all here
oh sorry jed
everyone is checking their guns
fair enough

sure is
too bad she always wearing buckskin
keeping her figure covered
at your age dani
you shouldnt be looking
i aint seen much else to do
uh-oh
were just talking about you
ms katie
jim here was saying
if id help keep an eye
on the weapons
hed sure like to ask you
for a dance
and what did you say mr seeger
i said id be delighted
on the contrary mr seeger
id be delighted
follow me my bonny lad
for ill not follow you
come on katie dont be bashful
sing it out loud for all of us
my father bought
at great expense
a grand high stepping grey
but when he puts her out a fence
she backs and backs away
hey ho the morning dew
hey ho the rose and rue

but take him with you all to hunt
and hell get in the way
hey ho the morning dew

for steeds to step
when eggs themselves go lay
and the ducks jump
into mustard jaw
to you my court
ill pay
hey ho the morning dew
hey ho the rose and rue
follow me
my bonny lad
for ill not follow you
uh-oh im sorry boys
but you have to leave
your shooting guns here
who said so
ms howard
yeah well nobody taking my gun
well then you cant go in
well why dont you try to stop us
i got that one from the iroquois
the iroquois taught me that one
i better tell them now
ill take a couple of these
this is as good a time as any
to make a little announcement
there a new treaty with the comanches
and itll be here from washington
in a few days
that means that you can all forget
that midnight deadline tomorrow
nobody is moving in
on comanche territory nobody
you can do whatever you like lady
but im moving in
if any of you newcomers feel
like arguing
ive got a couple of good
arguments right here
you old timers
know how my folks felt
about this territory
and how i feel about it
and im not going to let it break up
that silver is going to be mined
but itll be done legally
and therell be plenty of work
for everybody
and a chance to live right
and bring your kids up in the same way
this territory is going to grow faster
and bigger than we ever dreamed
those that feel like i do
will do well to stay
and as for the others well
well stake them to the expenses
of their trip back home
im staying katie
you can count on me too
yeah
what about the rest of you
katie im afraid
ive got some bad news
i was up on the north range
checking the cattle
and i found a couple of fresh carcasses
and some wolf tracks
wolves
yeah traveling in a pack
about a dozen of them
as near as i can make out
ive never heard of wolves
traveling in packs
this far south
theyre heading towards timberline
oh i got my stock grazing up there
i better get my rifle and get going
ill go with you
just a minute boys
youll need help
folks as part of these festivities
im organizing a wolf hunt
ill pay $20 in gold
for every pelt you bring back
well jim you sure you wont
change your mind
and come with us
no i better stay
and keep an eye on the party
hmm it quite a pretty party
to keep an eye on
what about you stacey
oh id have trouble
getting on a horse
let alone riding one
well im thinking on four pelts
one for each of us
let go
well i guess everybody here
except the boss
it only a wild turkey
we got a long day ahead of us
they make mighty good eating
here he comes
you all know what were here for
i had you men picked because i think
you all feel the way i do
we didnt come out here
for the good of the glorious west
but for our own good
now that being so we are moving in
on comanche territory tonight
are there any questions
yeah
suppose the federal government
brings troops in here to throw us out
there wont be any law
in this territory
for 25 years
by that time well all be rich enough
not to have to worry
youve been talking mighty big
about how were all gonna get rich
but you aint never mentioned
how were gonna split up the silver
ill let you know that
after we take over
and start digging it
id like to know right now
are there any other troublemakers
hankering to know how we split up
this aint no argument stacey
but what are the comanches
gonna be doing
while were digging the silver
that all taken care off
comanches without rifles
shouldnt present much of a problem
ive got the original treaty right here
with shall we say
a little added clause
clause 0
this treaty of peace to take effect
only on the condition that said
comanche indians
shall immediately as a token
of their intention
of keeping said peace
surrender all guns rifles
and powder in their possessions
well there it is quisima
all signed and sealed
this trick of white man
comanche must not give up gun
long before white man came
comanche hunted with bow
and knife was happy
white man gun
has brought them only sorrow
and bloodshed
since we will now live in peace
with white brothers
we not need these guns
it shall be as white brother wish
sorry you had to leave so soon
got to get the youngsters home
and straightened out
they act too much
sure was a swell shindig ms howard
that cake was every bit
as good as mom
mmm almost
bye-bye
bye bye
well it looks like your party
is a success in more ways than one
thanks to you
it was really your idea
folks took the change in plans
very nicely
im sure you wont have any trouble
and someday soon
ill be coming through
this way again
and this territory will be booming
youre not leaving
in a couple of days
i want to get down there
and find out what it all about
when do you expect to get back
id be more up to hurry
if i knew i was being missed
in that case jim bowie
youd better hurry
im going to miss you too
oh what the matter danl
didnt you get any wolves
i found plenty of wolves
two-legged wolves
jim bowie you and me have been took in
like a couple of first-class
greenhorns
meaning what
meaning if there a wolf pack
in them hills ill eat my saddle
looks like ms howard and her brother
dealt it to us right off
the bottom of the deck
i hope you know what youre
talking about mr seeger
because i dont
no i suppose you dont know
where your brother is
or what he is up to
of course i do
he took the buckboard back
to the ranch
and you can just stop
your playacting young woman
stacey and most of those men
are up in the hills
in that supposed-to-be wolf hunt
and they are aiming to move in
on the comanches
well that not true
naturally she dont know
nothing about it
just like she dont know
her brother rides
like a
and he mighty handy
in a lot of other ways
jim i dont know anything about this
i swear it
ive got to hand it to you
ms howard that wolf hunt
was a stroke of genius
youve got to believe me jim
you picked a clever way
of getting the guns back
to the men and sneaking them out
without arousing suspicion
jim youve got to listen to me
ive listened enough
let go
boozer i want to see you
in the office
im kind of busy out there ms katie
get over there
where stacey
i dont know
i guess he went home
you know where he is
and what he up to
no maam
i dont know nothing
then youd better start guessing
no
stay right where you are
and dont move
what is this a joke
listen boozer
ive talked big and tough
all of my life
but ive never shot anyone
youd better start talking
but if i talk
stacey will kill me
you can worry about that later
if you dont talk
ill kill you
we got here as fast as we could
we do not want quisima to think
it is the white man government
that betrays the comanche
our brother bowie has spoken well
quisima understand
there great problem
the boys still got a few hours
before sundown
plenty of time to get ready
for that pack of human hyenas
the comanches have given up their guns
they have only arrows and lances
and few knives
my brother bowie made for them
theyll never let you get
close enough to use them
well theyd pick you off
like a herd of buffalo
if comanches must die
they will die like men
but never gave up
sacred soil of their fathers
listen quisima
dying may be all right for your men
but youve got to get your women
and children out of here
let them take what they can carry
and hide out in the hills
then spread your men out
let them fight
from behind rocks and trees
caution your braves again
well wait beyond the village
until stacey men come close
on this mountain then well attack
well stacey
the men are rested and fed
and raring to go
well you can pass out some whiskey
no more than two drinks per man
youre quite a ways from home
arent you sis
i had to see for myself
well now you know
youre not thinking of whipping
your naughty brother
quite an arsenal youve got over there
youre not taking any chances
i cant afford to
the comanches are most cooperative
they gave up their guns
without a struggle
youve been planning this
for a long time
even before i come out here
i suppose id be wasting my breath
if i tried to talk you out of it
just as much as if i tried to talk you
into coming in with me
and giving up that nonsense
about building up the west
very well stacey
now we know where we stand
from now on im on the other
side of the fence
fortunes of war katie
where are you going
out of here if i dont get
a bullet in my back
take some men and go after her
were not waiting any longer
were moving in on
the comanches right now
ha ha
ha ha
i dont know how im gonna make out
with your kind of knife jim
i was practically weaned
on this arkansas toothpick
remember it cuts up as well as down
this not white man fight
you go
we like it here pakanah
besides weve gotta make
things right on account
of what stacey doing
it fellers like him
that gives a white man a bad name
once in anger
i want kill my brother bowie
now if you let me
i want fight beside him
glad to have you
well wouldnt have to wait long
to get his wish
here they come
they wont get their guns back
tell them to save their arrows
well you know what
it feels like to be a turkey
in a turkey shoot
well they cant hold that much longer
maybe if i try to ration them
you think so huh
look
they wont get their guns back eh
quick rifles
dont get them tied along
let go
i ought to turn you over
to the comanches
but youll be a lot safer
with the federal government
as soon as i finish my business
with mr houston
ill be back
hurry jim
ill need a lot more help now
looking like that
youll do all right
well goodbye kate
bye jim
good luck
that aint no way
to say goodbye to a gal
you big galoot
go ahead and kiss her

to make your dreams come true

sorry to disappoint you
but im a songwriter not a singer
when i get on stage i freeze
what if the fate of the free world
rested on your voice
ok if the fate of the free world
depended on me singing
maybe
all i ever really wanted
is to sit in the dark
and hear someone great
singing my songs
i wanna be the one
who writes the music
i remember the first time my mother
played me bridge over troubled water
by simon and garfunkel
i remember exactly
what she was wearing
i remember exactly how her hair smelled
i remember exactly how i felt
and every time i hear that song
i remember exactly
what she was wearing
and exactly how her hair smelled
and exactly how i felt
cause the great songs last forever
so what the problem
well
they tell me the only way
to get my songs heard
is to go out there
and sing em myself

this little problem straightaway

a superficial response
as usual
doesnt calm me down
let pin it up

only five days left
until the antarctic conference
until we reach palmer station
well have to keep this pace
will all  countries
be at the antarctic conference
they should be
it a meeting
to decide the fate
of the survivors after all
we cant be late
wait a second
hit it again
it no use
im sorry
it not your fault
what should we do
there no time
shall we walk
walk
were still 620 miles
away from palmer station
even i couldnt be so reckless
but since weve come this far
norway station
should be close
we should be fine
if we go there
she pregnant
yoshizumi
yes
can you stay here
with that woman
huh
i have to get
to the conference on time
so there no way
i can take a woman

casualties over here
control confirmed we expected
that when we saw the hull damage
was it decompression
negative on that control
lt almost looks like a wild animal
tore through the crew
man #2 what the hell happened here
rapid beeping
sir lm showing four live ones
four
there supposed
to be 37 crewmen
raiders never hit a ship
this big before
we should call in reinforcements
cut the chatter marines
locate those life signs private
theyre in engineering
near the shock point core
that it then
lock and load marines
explosion
hey look out
what happening
the engines are firing
how is that possible
whispering voices
lt over
theyre dead finally
sobbing
lt finished
lt not finished
this is too big to end here
weve been in contact
with a higher power
god damn it lve had enough
of your crazy shit stross
you cant see because
youre not a true vessel
will you two shut the hell up
we still need to work
together all right
weve got to get--
quiet
listen do you hear that
banging
woman oh my god
theyve come for us
lt cant be more of them
we destroyed that damn thing
l wont let them hurt her
this is abraxis rescue team
ldentify yourselves
thank god youre here
l knew theyd come
lm dr lsabel cho chief medical officer of the usg
obannon
you just get away now nobody taking my baby
away from me again
drop the weapon now
nickolas it all right
kuttner dont do it
put em down
no please you have no idea
what weve been through
grunting
they sent you didnt they
they think that they
can control this
they are all fools cant you see
lt already happening
convergence is here
we shall all be made whole
aggh
fools
control weve got one blue casualty
and four survivors in custody
bringing em in
mechanical whirring
man #  what the fuck do you think
really happened over there
the bodies had these looks
on their faces like whatever
killed those people
drove em crazy first
man #2
what command saying
man #  command treating the whole thing as a
navigational accident
accident my ass
man #3 lt almost looked like
they killed each other
man #  lf you ask me something
went seriously fubar out there
and the big guys back home
are trying to cover their big fat ass--
oh excuse us
we didnt see you
they sent an interrogation unit
all the way out here
man #3 what kind of shit
did those bastards
from the obannon get into
l dont know
but they are righteously fucked now
scans confirm the target
has been destroyed
lt unrecoverable
unfortunate
but not a complete loss
what of the survivors
only four lm afraid
lm informed our specialist
is among them
luckily yes were prepping
for debriefing now sir
l am authorizing
enhanced interrogation techniques
l see do you think that
will be necessary
we dont have time for subtlety
there have been questions raised
about what happened at aegis 7
when word of the obannon gets out people will
demand answers
lf you cant provide them
l shall be forced
to re-evaluate
my confidence in your abilities
of course sir
you have seven hours
before your ship docks at the sprawl
this situation needs
to be resolved by then
yes sir l understand perfectly
what are you standing
around for
have the first subject
brought in
lt time to go to work
lt everywhere
all around us
inside us-the patterns
hey
guards
l see it all now
will somebody talk to me
human life is only a passing phase
lm not supposed to be here
hey is anybody out there
god damn it
somebody open this door
lt okay vivian
dont worry pumpkin were safe now
everything gonna be just fine
soon well be back with mommy
and then well all be together
man this is fucking crazy
l mean it just doesnt make
any goddamn sense
we survived that horror show
back on the obannon
just to be locked up here
you know the reason were in here
is because that fucking lunatic
shot a marine
lf anybody should be
in here it him
lt okay baby girl
he just a little scared
dont pay any mind
l dont have anything to do
with this crazy bastard
l dont even know these people
borges will you calm down
youre not helping matters
they have deeper reasons
for detaining us
than mr kuttner outburst
mr borges
there a great design
behind everything that happened
and were each a part of it now
seriously am l the only one
who didnt go batshit crazy
back on that damn planet
stross is right about one thing
we might have a problem
l did a tour on one of these
with a med unit a few years ago
were on board
a government interceptor ship
in a holding cell
where they detain terrorists
so what does that mean
lt means the government
might want someone to blame
for what happened
on the obannon
and that will most certainly
be us alejandro
this may well be the last time
we see each other
dont touch me
lsabel what the matter
well it about fucking time
what going on
why are you holding us here
step back
hey hey hey
take it easy
no problem here
nickolas kuttner
you will come with us
huh-uh
lm not leaving my little girl
dont do that
let me talk to him okay
get your hands off me
lm not letting you
take me away from her
electricity crackles
screams
stop stop it
he had enough
youll kill him
what the hell is going on
l dont know
whispering voices
let me go god damn it
she needs me
you bastards cant you see her
ln the chair if you please
she right there
electricity crackles
screams
no no she needs me
l have to protect her
she needs her father
no no vivian vivian
let me go
let me go
mr kuttner please calm yourself
we have some questions
lm not telling you shit
until l see my daughter
mr kuttner
the mind holds
countless rational
and irrational fears
for you the fear
is being burned alive
beeps
gasps
no no
screaming
panting
that was simply an electronically induced
hallucination
created in the brain
but the mind is reality
is it not
state your name and occupation
nickolas kuttner ex-marine
security officer
on the cdc obannon
what the hell do you want
from me
you are not here
to ask questions mr kuttner
we are going to ask the questions
you are going to answer them
honestly and completely
do you understand
yeah l understand
we want you to start
from the beginning
we want you tell us
about the mission to aegis 7
aegis 7
the obannon got word
to ship out about a week ago
we were ordered to titan where we picked up a
team of civilian tech heads
mission specs were sealed
so nobody knew where we were headed
after we were underway
a few days
the captain called a briefing
stross
ls that your daughter mr kuttner
she beautiful my son has
the exact same color eyes
mind your business stross
he doesnt wanna talk
about it nolan
his little girl died in an accident
back home a few weeks ago
oh god that terrible
l dont know what ld do
if anything happened to my little boy
dr cho how it going girl
hey stross l saw your wife earlier
she seemed a little stressed
alexis is always stressed
so lsabel wanna go grab a drink
at the hole after this
they got 2-credit specials
after 0500
lm sorry l cant
lve got two rookies
with artificial gravity sickness
to deal with
ugh boring doc
you stay locked in med bay
all the time
youll never get a man
interested in you
have some fun
personally l think starting any mission
without a drink or six is a bad idea
lll grab a beer with you
if the offer open
oh l dont usually drink
with tech heads
but sure why not
lm no lowly tech head
thank you very much
lm gravimetric
control engineer first class
so what do you guys know
about this mission l dont
that is what we called you
here to tell you mr nayim
commander sergenko
l didnt realize you were on this ship
excuse me sir
lm alejandro borges with
the engineering team from titan station
l understood this was just
a routine gravimetric stabilization gig
what with all the secrecy
this isnt your standard
asteroid patch-up job son
this is big time
lt must be dragging our sorry asses
all the way to the edge of the galaxy--
sergenko
eyes up and mouth shut people
good morning captain
good morning
this is why were here
lm here cause it double wages
chuckles
the planet is aegis 7
lt was virtually destroyed
in a mining accident three weeks ago
as you can see
the impact has made
the planet unstable
unstable
damn
that where we come in
ourjob is to hold aegis 7 together
borges youve got to be kidding
there is no way--
the captain is not
yet finished speaking
after we achieve orbit
eight drop ships will deliver
gravity stabilizers
to these key points
the artificial gravity web
generated should be enough
to stabilize the planet
are you serious
with only eight units
that planet is practically
one huge bomb ready to explode
how long do you think
a few gravity stabilizers
will hold something
like that together
this is what you
signed on for mr borges
lt too late for you
to back out now
any other questions
when do we drop captain
0500 dismissed
stross cho kuttner rin
we would like to speak with you
l understand some of you
have heard rumors
about what happened
on aegis 7
you can speak freely
rin lve heard
they found something on
the planet surface so terrible
a guy called clarke
dropped a whole continent on it
something-something alien
bullshit
captain the rumors are true
they discovered an alien artifact
65 million years old
cho
my god lt actually real
kuttner
what the hell is it
sergenko
no one knows for sure
lt supposed
to contain certain properties
what kind of properties
that classified dr cho
even to me
and l assume the artifact
was destroyed upon impact
correct
but satellite imaging
reveals fragments have survived
your team mission is
to locate and secure
whatever can be salvaged
of the artifact
on a planet that could
explode any minute
lt will be well worth the risk
mr kuttner
let cut to the chase captain
just how much
are these fragments worth
two million credits a kilo
you know
l hear aegis 7 is beautiful
this time of year
man
shuttle   prepare for launch
nayim were dropping in three
youre playing hologames
three minutes before a drop pawling
yeah l cant pause it right now
arent you a little young
to be on this operation anyway
laughs
my cousin a genius at two things
hologames and gravity stabilizers
wed be screwed without him
the real question is
what are you guys doing here
youre not engineers
were surveying
for gravity fluctuations
fluctuations
the whole planet one big
goddamn fluctuation
what the hell
are you surveying
locking onto gravity stabilizer
releasing docking clamps
ready to drop
hold onto your breakfast kiddies
man
shuttle   drop in five four
three two drop
nayim
entering lower atmosphere
here where the ride
gets fun folks
yee-haw
l always hate this part
crazy bastard level us out
explosion
kuttner
will you look at that
borges god damn
cho
holy shit
this isnt a planet
lt a freakin disaster in process
borges this is nearly total gravimetric
and geothermal disruption
lt seems impossible
the planet held together this long
almost as if--
as if what
nothing nothing at all
l need more data
okay noah omar
ourjob is to keep that stabilizer
from overloading
let these guys go do
whatever the fuck it is
theyre really doing here
the scanners are calibrated to
the frequency of the mortar fragments
sweep out in branching formation
maintain radio contact at all times
any questions
back here at 0900
explosion
ho
this is bullshit
rin come in
this rock is getting
more unstable by the minute
and l havent found a damn thing
kuttner lve lost track
of your signal
rin
come in do you read me
come in
rin you copy
beeping
holy shit rin come in
lve got something
panting

just no more spiders
man tell us about the disaster

l was just there to do a job
okay noah omar
ourjob is to keep that stabilizer
from overloading
let these guys go do
whatever the fuck it is
theyre really doing here
something up
with their little expedition
suspicious as hell
nayim
what do you mean
theyre here to measure
gravity fluctuations
l dont buy it for a second
loud rumbling
the planet breaking up
move your asses
we got work to do
pawling looks like lm gonna have
an interesting first day on the job
nayim l knew six stabilizers
couldnt hold it
borges weve got to hold her
there are still teams on the ground
pawling
the power flow out of balance
gravity fluctuating go to manual
noah do you have it
just a second almost there
noah
got it yes
nayim good work kid lm impressed
that my coz
whoa whoa there
shh settle down big boy
that it
pawling
sliced diced dead
god come on there gotta be
a harder setting than impossible
eh the movie was better
hey l never asked you borges
how did you end up with that arm
not much to tell really
mining accident l lost it when
a grav stabilizer l was working blew
my coz is being
humble again nayim
alejandro there saved
five guys off that rig he a hero
we lost 5 men that day
lm no hero
lm sorry
life takes us strange places
l was going to be a priest
when l was young
youre a unitologist omar
you really believe aliens
created the human race
look at us
we have perfect symmetry
and a brain as powerful
as the most advanced computer
and this came out of nothing
coughs  bullshit
laugh if you wish my friend
but human life was created
by alien beings
and when we die we return to them
grav flux is starting up again
weve got an overload
nayim
gravity web is destabilizing
she wont hold
we could drop a dozen stabilizers
on this planet and it still wouldnt keep what left
from blowing
borges we need to hold it
until the teams get back
noah can you balance the flow
kuttner what are you doing here
kuttner muttering
what he doing
l wont let you
grunting
omar
wait wait
what the hell is your problem man
we dont have time for this shit
l wont let them hurt you vivian

we have to get him back to the ship
doc is he gonna be okay
lm so sorry
explosion
nayim the stabilizer
is overloading l cant hold it
alejandro alejandro
they need you
nayim
the whole power grid is failing
alejandro lm sorry my friend
automatic systems are a total loss
lt a cascade failure
there nothing we can do
we have to get out of here
this is sergenko all units evacuate
get back
to the shuttles everyone
move go go move it

go around hurry
commander sergenko
too late
borges take this
lt more important
than you know protect it
get out of here
all of you
that an order
get on the ship
screams
sergenko
what is happening
gravity increasing
screaming
nayim ls everyone all right
omar omar above you look out
omar omar
borges we cant help him
we have to go
we must get to the ship
grunts
what the fuck is happening
get me out of this
shut the fuck up
you crazy motherfucker
buckle up guys
we have to get off the planet
someone cut me loose
god damn it
hold on
stross
the planet going
why is the engineer
flying the goddamn ship
borges
lm barely a pilot okay
l think lm gonna throw up
aim for kuttner
shit
weve lost shuttle 4
we must get the shard back
to the obannon
what are they doing
the ship is too close to the planet
they need to clear the gravity well
before they shock point out
that bastard not
leaving us behind hold on
borges we have to go faster
lt tearing apart now
the engines--
look out for the engines
hold on
cho borges
this is bullshit
were coming in too fast
l told you we shouldnt
have let him drive
shit shit shit
get those fires out now
move it come on come on
are you all right
someone call medical
that son of a bitch
man
full power to the engines
woman no contact with survey teams
crew chattering
are we far enough
to shock point
you you knew
hold on son
weve got a situation here
she going
emergency power
to shock point drive
shocking out in eight
collision alert
seven six five
four three
were not gonna make it
two
screaming
look out
explosions
emergency thrusters
fly with the blast
ride it ride it god damn it
firing thrusters
damage report
damage report
hull breach
in section b
shock point drive is down we have
heavy casualties in engineering sir
weapons control
vaporize any planetary debris
that gets too close
lieutenant marcus
send out a distress signal
sir those rocks
will tear us to pieces
we wont survive very long
without the shock point drive
l understand
the situation ensign voigt
borges get your team down
to the engine room
and repair that drive
mr borges
l gave you an order
lm not fixing shit
until you explain
why this fucking rock
was worth my cousin life sir
what are you talking about
captain kuttner had some
sort of psychotic breakdown
engineer pawling
was killed as were most
of the engineering teams
follow me all of you
first officer l want a full
damage report in five minutes
yes sir
okay ladies man your stations
the bodies have been
taken to cold storage
kuttner is under observation
in sick bay
captain perhaps it would be
best to keep the shard
under quarantine until we know
more about its properties
mmm of course
l was hoping for more but--
you were hoping for more
you sent us
on a suicide mission
for a lump of rock
this is much more
than just a lump of rock son
the high lq boys back home
say this will change
the face of science itself--
and that worth all the people
who died back there
easy alejandro lm sure
the captain couldnt predict
the shard influence on kuttner
look son the shard--
it worth a lot of money
enough for you to take care
of engineer pawling family
for the rest of their lives
you son of a bitch
borges
take it easy alejandro
loud bang
what the fuck was that
pieces of the planet
are still impacting the ship
we need to get clear
of the debris field
mr borges if l didnt need you
to save the ship
you would be
in the brig for that
now get your ass down
to the engine room
and repair
the shock point drive
or were all dead
alejandro
how old was pawling
cho about 9
lm sorry noah
l got you this job
lt all my fault
and you never came into direct
contact with the fragment
no l swear l never
touched the damn thing
lie detection states
999% truth
he never touched it
thank you mr borges
youve been most cooperative
what happening
well have you escorted
to guest quarters
for the remainder
of your trip to the sprawl
you mean l can go
seriously
youll have to go through
med scans of course
but youll be back home
to your family as soon as we dock
oh thank god
thank you thank you
right this way mr borges
l cant believe it
lm actually going home
l gotta tell you guys
a couple times back on
the obannon l honestly thought
l was a dead man
have them remains taken
to cold storage
and bring in nolan stross
yes sir
panting
no no
what are you doing
please dont
dont do this
no stop let me out no
lll be good let me out
oh god please let me out
claustrophobia
most horrible
now l take it
youre ready to talk sense
were on a bit of a deadline
lm sure you understand
yes yes l understand--
better than you
could possibly comprehend
dr stross you have been
chief research scientist
on the obannon
for a little over a year now
one year two months
and nine days
and all that while
youve also been clandestinely
a part of our government
secret investigation
into the alien marker
ls that correct
that correct
since l was already a part
of the obannon crew
they decided to send us in
after the lshimura incident
l was to examine
any fragments in the marker
and make a thorough report
l see
now why dont you share with me
the results of your investigation
after we returned
to the obannon
l went to check on my family
my family means
a great deal to me
the shock point drive
is down
but how are we gonna get
home without it
an engineering team is working
around the clock to fix it alexis
dont worry
everything gonna be fine
wont it little fella
nolan level with me
does all this have anything to do
with that other research youre doing
the government stuff
alexis
can you please not grill me
during the few moments a day
l get with my son
l need to go the captain wants me
to examine the artifact
we found on the planet
what kind of artifact
the classified kind
what about that doctor
youre always with
ls she classified too
alexis
you spend more time
with her than with us
she a colleague why would
l have brought you on this trip
if there was anything going on
because youre the senior science
officer and l pestered to come along
lve gotta get to the lab
you cant keep running there
every time l wanna
have a discussion
about our relationship
dont wait up
baby crying
oh sweetie
shushing
lm here
mommy here
knock on door
come in
caleb l really should be
starting the analysis of the shard
captain
l want some answers
mr stross
l nearly lost my ship
recovering that damn thing
l know lm just supposed
to turn it over to you
youll have to take that up
with home base
l have
they tell me all matters
connected with the shard
are need-to-know only
my goddamn ship scientist
needs to know more about this
mission than l do apparently
excuse me for saying so sir
but you dont look well
lt the shard
l can hear it talking to me
caleb have you discussed this
with dr cho
loud rumbling
just get the damn thing
out of my sight
but lm warning you stross
whatever the hell is going on
you keep it in your lab
were in deep enough
shit here as it is
lt even more astonishing than
l could have possibly imagined
what is doctor
the structure is similar
to a hologram
every particle contains all
the information of the whole
what made this
cuneiform-like symbol
there no scratching
or sign of cutting--
as if the crystal itself
gave birth to it
what
what happening
voices whispering
the shard it--
oh my head
some form
of telepathic encoding
dr stross
are you feeling well
lm fine
lm fine
my god it a form of dna
a blueprint
nolan what are you doing
lsabel you wont believe it
sandra that will be all
thank you
but doctor we need to run
a spectral analysis--
that will be all miss burns
lsabel it amazing
the shard it the key
to an alien language
a guide to dna chains
lve never seen before
this may contain the secret
to the future of human evolution
nolan are you okay
you seem a little hyperactive
try and understand
this is the finding of a lifetime
kissing
well dont let it
go to your head hmm
but this could alter
the very destiny of humanity
change everything
shh well talk about that later
but right now
laughs
the shard seems to generate
some sort of carrier wave
so advanced my instruments
can barely detect it
though l have a theory
that when it comes into contact
with dead human tissue
it reanimates the cells
possibly into a new
and more evolved form
can you explain what happened
to kuttner on the planet
well it seems most humans
when influenced
by the marker
become hyperpsychotic
only a very small percent
are resilient to its effects
kuttner was already on the edge--
his grief over his daughter
the shard pushed him over
into a delusional state
and you believe the shard was
originally created by aliens
a higher intelligence
most definitely
what a primitive mind
would call god  gasps
god he says
stross maybe you
should get some sleep
stross stross
can you hear me
voices whispering
screams
the shard somehow
transmits nightmares
dreams and visions
but the knowledge it emanates
l need a test subject
distant explosion
already the signal from the shard
permeates the dead flesh
of the subject
lve never seen
anything transform
an entire host cell so quickly
lt-it beautiful
damn it
how can l be expected
to complete my experiments
under these conditions
what
that not possible
whispering voices
growls
screams  oh no
lt all your fault doctor
they will all suffer
because of you
panting
h-hallucination
lt was just a hallucination
the door-l broke the seal
l wasnt thinking  gasps
good lord
what have l done
dr stross lve got the analysis--
sandra get out
sandra screams
oh no
no get away
lt not my fault
the shard-it tricked me
leave me alone
hold the light steady will ya
growling
lt still after me
here it wont find me in here
no
oh my god no oh god
men screaming
panting
oh god oh god
l need help
the captain
the captain
captain l have to tell you
lt about the shard
not right now stross
lve got the engine room on the horn
l need that shock point
back online now borges
thanks to that class-a
clusterfuck down on the planet
captain l barely
have any engineers left
ltll be a miracle
if we can pull this thing off
mister l have taken all the shit--
screaming
what the hell is going on
were under attack
borges borges
god damn it
lieutenant marcus
take a security team down there
captain please listen to me
not now stross
woman we have a code 3
emergency in the engine room
all personnel report
to their stations
this is not a drill
repeat this is not a drill
alarm blaring
alexis the baby
emergency stations move it
move it
oh oh god
screaming
alexis
lex are you here
alexis l made
a horrible mistake
the shard
lm not thinking clearly
baby cooing
alexis
son son is that you
screeching
get off of me
grunting
where my son
alexis nolan
that my baby no
you monster
get away from my family
screams
panting  nolan
shouts
panting
nolan nolan something happening
the bodies--
theyre turning into creatures
lt has to be the shard
oh god
oh my god
seeing those dead creatures
must have truly affected her
lsabel changed after that
but l had to do it
those things were
threatening my family
dr stross
where is your family now
l-l locked them
in their quarters
did your men find them
are they safe what about the baby
his heart rate is 60
l need to see them
convergence is coming
we have to be together
when the change arrives
dr stross where is your family
ln my quarters l told you
yes you did
beeps
electricity crackles
where is your family
safe in quarters
saved them-l saved them
lnteresting
lve never seen
such a complete block before
lncrease the voltage
screaming
l wont
l wont remember
you cant make me remember
really quite extraordinary
beeps
youre just doing what it
wants you to do all of you
youre gonna kill me now
arent you
like you did kuttner
and borges
we dont want
to kill you dr stross
you dont
of course not
you came into direct contact
with the marker
lt actually communicated
with you
your mind holds the key
to its language
youre exactly
what weve been looking for
what is that
what are you doing
please stop
l did everything l was asked to do
why are you doing this
to me stop
stop it
please stop
not this please
please please
lnterrogator unfortunate
about the claustrophobia
woman they will be pleased
wont they sir
stross is everything
they wanted
not quite everything
bring in lsabel cho
woman
sprawl this is abraxis
requesting permission to dock
man permission granted abraxis
welcome home
lsabel screaming crying
you are making this
unnecessarily difficult doctor
we merely wish to know
about the shard full effects
upon the obannon crew
youre talking
to the wrong person
nolan studied the artifact
and we want to know more
about nolan stross
did he reveal the details
of his investigation to you
you were having an affair
why is that relevant
dr cho l have no wish
to cause you further discomfort
but if you do not
answer my question
l shall be forced
to intensify my methods
do you understand me
yes
tell me about your affair
with dr stross
l-the affair lasted
several months
wed been working together
for a year
l didnt plan it
lt was just something
that happened
he told me he was
going to leave his wife
but l didnt want him to
l tried to stay away
but l couldnt
for the first time in my life
l was in love
after we found
the shard on aegis 7
nolan started acting
strange erratic
do you know what
the most fascinating thing
about the crystal structure lsabel
hmm
the patterns there
are almost familiar
like a dream
lve nearly forgotten
l think youve lost me
l only speak english
and korean
this is going to shape
reality itself lsabel
nolan l want you
to come to sick bay
let me run some
psych scans
remember what that thing
did to kuttner
l dont need psych scans
you have no comprehension
of what lm doing here
lve nearly grasped
its sacred language--
the ultimate source
of human life itself
nolan youre starting
to scare me
l think it time
for you to leave
l have work to do
all right
l need to check
on kuttner anyway
so how our patient today
resting comfortably doctor
are you feeling better
nickolas
head hurts
still cant remember much
do you remember seeing
your daughter
of course
she out playing right now
shell be back soon
of course she will
those engineers better
get the drive working
l need to get vivian home
to her mother
lm sure theyre doing
their best l have to go
try and get some rest okay
whenever l close my eyes
all l see are monsters
all right doctors we have
a dozen doas to process
ripley and wells should have
finished the prep by now
the captain
wants a full report by--
gasps
oh my god
man good lord
the bodies are gone
what could have done this
by the great marker
ls that dr ripley
call the captain
weve got to--
growling
snarling
get out get out
shut the door
run get out of there
shut the door
ls that door gonna hold
did everyone get out

get me off off this table now
lt the monsters isnt it
l knew theyd be back
screaming
snarling
come on

l can feel it
explosion
where the rest of the crew
l dont know

lm sure she safe
look if the shard doing this
then we need to find nolan
come on
all this blood--
what happened
to all the bodies
man they changed
they became one
l saw it
l saw it happen
kuttner
chief is that you
they want you too
they want you both dead
oh shit
chief what are you doing
screaming
let go this way
right behind you
where are we now
this is nolan--
l mean dr stross quarters

no shit you think
nolan

doc
stross lsabel

gunfire
look out there another one
how many of these things are there
on your left
aim for its eyes
lt still coming
get out of the halls
get to safety
look out
screaming
lt still coming
stross what the hell is going on
what are these things
they are the future captain
theyre what we were always
meant to become
glorious and immortal
god damn it nolan get it together
what wrong with you man
captain
weve got more company
too many to fight
we need a way out
vivian baby is that you
vivian wait
come back lt not safe down there
kuttner
where the hell he going
no he right
they cant follow us through there
then hurry move your ass
he went into the vent
get moving
lll cover you
keep going all of you
hustle it up pallas
right behind you captain
no
let go you son of a bitch
ow
officer pallas
caleb get them out of here
officer pallas leslie leslie
there nothing you can do
she gone she gone
she--
she was a good officer
a good shipmate
we need to keep going captain
those things may find a way
into the vent
come on vivian went this way
by all means let follow the ghost
of his dead daughter
lm not entirely comfortable
depending on someone
who has obviously lost his mind
yeah l know exactly
what you mean
vivian says we should
go down there
cho l think were over
the science section
captain this is your lab
right stross
sounds quiet enough
lt all clear
come on
something got him
no borges it us
lt kuttner
l know who it is
gun cocks
take you with me
stop it stop it
we dont have time for this shite
calm down alejandro
l only want safety
for my daughter
your daughter dead asshole
just like my cousin you killed
no vivian dont listen
he confused he just scared
borges what the situation
with the shock point drive
did you get it operational
fuck no the engine room
is totally fucked
we barely got out
we
sorry captain we were overrun
captain
they got the bridge as well
let me take a look at that arm
pretty rough laceration
but youll be okay
lll need some help here
lll help love
lsabel what is wrong with you
keep away from me
you sick bastard
or l swear lll throw you out there
with the rest of the monsters
stross we could
use you over here
yes captain
what the hell is going on
why is my crew turning
into goddamn monsters
homo sapiens
are the true monster
these are higher forms of life
were becoming them
and soon we will all become one
what did you say
lgnore him he not well
no no there an old
unitologist proverb
all forms of life will unite
in convergence
and we shall be one
my mom said that we were living
in the end of days
convergence is coming soon
loud bang
by the look of things
it seems like your mom was right
so how the hell do we stop it
stross youre the only one
who understands those things
how can we stop them
nolan look we need you okay
the necromorphs are animated
by the signal from the shard
we have to stop the carrier wave
then give me that goddamn thing
lll stop it
didnt even scratch it
there no way you can
destroy it only shatter it
and every piece will retain
the properties of the original
like a hologram
there got to be a way
no no
lt was designed by an intelligence
we cant begin to comprehend
you would have to cast it
into the heart of a star
or a reactor core
yes
yes that might do it
then we take this thing
to the engine room and we destroy it
are you serious the engine room
is fucking crawling
with those things
then we fight our way through them
we dont have a lot of choice
the ship cant take much more
what do we have for weapons
just your gun and these bone saws
we grabbed in medical
l was working on those things
until you guys showed up
captain are you actually building
something out of all this junk
flamethrower
a few incendiary grenades
found some plasma cutters--
charges are pretty low
okay then
can you travel lieutenant marcus
yes sir
then everybody arm yourselves
let go
kuttner
god damn it quiet
cho those things couldnt have
gotten the whole crew could they
captain everybody stay together
borges wait what was that
l thought l heard something
lt clear this way
metal rattles
l know l heard something
look out
marcus get out of here
aw shit
cho move it
lt right behind you
l think were just pissing it off
got any better ideas
yeah run
cho this way
hurry down here
jenny
lana dont get too close to it
lt all right
lt my roommate jenny
praise the marker
jenny are you okay
lana no get away from it
lana
screaming
captain theyre right behind us
borges come on doc we gotta go
let see if this
bad boy works
explosion
finally the engine room
through that door
were not too far
from the reactor core
were not there yet look
snarling
let go move it
weve got a hull breach
hold on to something
alarm blaring
were losing oxygen
get to the engine room
we can seal the airlock there
help me oh god help me
hold on
captain hang on son
lm coming for you
almost got you
a little closer
no
no
cho nickolas look out
kuttner
grunting
got you
thanks
come on move it
get your asses up here
we have a problem
what now
the power is out
to the airlock door
lt damaged on our side
lt has to be closed
from out there
kuttner anyone out there
will be torn to pieces
lll do it
no youll be trapped
cho captain well find another way
you will do as youre ordered doctor
you too mr borges
send this thing back to hell
where it belongs
and tell my wife she was right
l should have retired
before this trip
all right you bastards
come and get me
my god he gone
the captain gone
now what
lll tell you what
we throw that damn thing
into the core like he told us
this way
there it is
the shock point drive
the most powerful machine
mankind has ever created
cho
how do we do it
we throw it into the core
over the edge
of the platform there
screaming
cho
no the shard
lve got it
oh shit
low roaring
l am so fucking sick
of these fucking things
you and me both
oh shit
there too many
cho no
borges get off
you son of a bitch
whispering voices
get away from him
what is stross waiting for
throw it into the core
destroy it
kuttner
stross stross
voices whispering
nolan what the hell
are you doing
destroy that thing now
god damn it stross gimme that
dont you see lsabel
lt too important to destroy--
oh shut up  grunts
throw it
throw it now
explosion
lt over
theyre dead
finally
lt finished
gasps
you know the rest
lt a pity you didnt come
into direct contact
with the shard
you have a fine mind
and a strong will
lm sure it would have
resonated with you
as it did with stross
oh my god
you knew what would happen if we
found the fragments didnt you
we are not ignorant
of the marker capabilities
you didnt just want the fragments
you wanted us exposed to that thing
all that horror
all those deaths--
you did it on purpose
you have nothing to fear
ln the end you wont suffer
l promise
l dont understand
during our session
we docked at the sprawl
there is someone here
who would like to speak to you
ah my dear dr cho
lt a pleasure
to finally meet you
lm so sorry
about any discomfort
this process may
have caused you
but you must understand
how important this project is
project
what project who are you
l l am a simple overseer
to a greater purpose
we are working to change
the face of humanity my dear
come with me and lll explain
doctor you and your team
did a fine job
my compliments
yes sir
thank you sir
lm very happy
that youre pleased
very pleased indeed
good day
praise the great marker
l thought ourjobs
might be in jeopardy
do you think
we might be promoted
lm sure the overseer will see
that we are appropriately rewarded
gun cocks
overseer as a doctor
you must see that the marker
is the greatest discovery
in the history of humanity
lt has the potential
to alter human dna
to save our flawed dying species
lt turns people
into mindless monsters
ls that the kind of nightmare
you want to unleash
lts power is controllable
under the right circumstances
we just need some more time
to continue our research
into the marker
regrettably these recent events
have become too public
we need an airtight cover story
and wed like you
to help us with that
you want me to just forget
everything that happened
to my shipmates on the obannon
and all those colonists on aegis 7
we have significant resources
dedicated to this project dr cho
youd be an important part
of the team
ln a few years you could be heading
the whole medical sciences division
please consider helping us
with this great work
l wont do it
youre playing god
with human life
people deserve to know the truth
sighs  lsabel
lm truly sorry you feel that way
what- grunting
secure the patient
what are you doing stop it
get your hands off of me
stop let me go
everything is ready
you may proceed
what are you going to do to me
someone has to be held responsible
whirring
no please dont do this
please oh god no
no
woman authorities today announced
the arrest of a suspect connected
to a recent series of terrorist attacks
on the usg lshimura the usg obannon
and a mining colony on aegis 7
lsabel cho a former medical officer
assigned to the obannon
was rescued from a lifepod
recovered after the obannon
engines were sabotaged
and the ship destroyed
lnterrogators have received
a full confession from miss cho
and sentencing is scheduled
for next week
the cover story is working well
people believe what
they wish to believe dr edgars
yes
door opens
ah it appears
dr stross has arrived
excellent that makes two
who have come into contact
with the marker
two who is the second
the engineer
who destroyed aegis 7
we found him half crazed
in an escape shuttle
lmagine our luck
synchronicity reveals the will
of the cosmos dr edgars
of course overseer
be gentle with the patient
his mind is the key
to the secrets of the marker
yes sir
welcome to your new home nolan
welcome to the sprawl
twinkle twinkle little star
how l wonder what you are
up above the world so high
like a diamond in the sky
twinkle twinkle little star
how l wonder what you are
instrumental music playing

well you keep him
that way eli
ill drop in on you
on my way back
hello there
you could have
ended up like that
officer
i know
there no excuse
i agree with you
may i have your
i was going pretty fast
wasnt i
you were going
pretty reckless too
you know
this is an old road
it tricky and dangerous
it lined with signs
that say 25 miles an hour
5 miles an hour
winding road
now those signs
can be quite interesting
if youre going slow enough
to read them
ive read them
all before
what do you think
we put them up for pedestrians
can you give me one good reason
why any sane person would drive
the way you were driving
no
you surprise me
i was sure you would
well actually officer
im maladjusted
i come from
a broken home
want me to write
that down for the judge
youre not going to
throw the book at me
are you
well here what
im going to do
im going to reach into
the hat and pull out just
one of your violations
forty-five miles
an hour in a 25 zone
sign there please
here your copy
ill save the reckless
driving charge for next time
operator operator
the sheriff office quick
sure looks like he put up
quite a struggle
yeah
be sure and dont touch
any of this stuff eli
dont worry i know
all about these things
no identification
of any kind
no wallet
labels all cut out
of the clothing
all we have for sure is
that he wasnt a suicide
ah
not with his hands tied
behind his back
you should have listened to me
i told you to come up right away
now eli
remember the story
about the boy who cried wolf
dont you go trying
to put the blame on me sheriff
nobody blaming anybody eli
if we followed up all your stories
wed have to put on two extra men
which by the way
you taxpayers wont let us have
you know it no wonder
old eli lives alone
no woman could stand
to listen to him all the time
i wish id listened
to him this once
there not enough time in the day
to stop and measure all the ifs
you made the same choice i would
and went after what you saw
instead of what you didnt see
that what youre paid to do
i know that
it doesnt make me
feel any better
if id gone with eli
that man might still be alive
now look boy
when i hired you
i hired myself a good lawman
i didnt think about
what happened in denver then
you stop thinking about it now
you shout your mouth
and solve this case
morning deputy
morning
rising with the sun
or just going to bed
hoping to catch some worms
im trying to get a line on a fellow
thought maybe you could help me
ill do my best
fellow about 55
60 years old tall
grayish hair
distinguished-looking
when last seen
wearing a suit of thin
dark gray shiny material
doesnt sound like
anybody ive seen
thanks anyway
oh if he turns up do you want me
to tell him youre looking for him
no thanks
he turned up already
oh yeah here it is
re wallace
el trovatore motel
that all
well that all you asked me
well that all youve got
no permanent address or anything
nope
well you must have asked
to see his driver license
why
well most people do
when they rent an automobile
to a perfect stranger
oh he didnt rent the heap
he bought it for a 50 bucks
col cash on the line
well registration
oh he hasnt gotten around
to fill that out yet
hey look youre the law
what do you think should i
send it to him at the motel
no send it to the county morgue
good morning
morning
looks like it going to be
another scorcher dont it
yes maam
are you selling tickets
for the sheriff rodeo
or are you
just raiding the place
i wouldnt think of it
just trying to track down
some information
on a mr re wallace
oh yeah number 8
i dont think
he here now though
i dont see his old yellow car
you mind if i take a look
in his room
why should i mind
can you tell me anything
about this mr wallace
well not an awful lot
im afraid
he been here
four or five days
but he not gabby
like most of us
very quiet
fine-looking gentleman
id say a businessman of some sort
probably from the east
has that funny way of talking
this is 8
what
what in the world
could have happened
this is just awful
why everything ruined
ill certainly have plenty
to say to that mr wallace
i dont think he did it maam
how can i ever
get it cleaned up
dont touch a thing please
as a favor to the state of arizona
no label on this clothing either
not even any laundry marks
all this expensive luggage
but no initials on it
nothing
what does that mean to you
first i thought the killer
was trying to cover up
the identity of the victim
now i think the victim
destroyed his own identification
how do you figure that
any man who buys luggage
as expensive as this
usually has his initials put on it
could be
could be brother bloodhound
dont just stand there
he aint treed yet
get out and see
if you can pick up his track
it sure funny how now
when i got nothing to say to you
you keep wanting me to talk
youve got to keep talking
eli till i can make
some sense out of it
i cant remember crazy talk
when it dont make sense
well try think
what else
over
he did say something
about over the rim
over the rim
that must mean the grand canyon
well that narrows it down
to arizona anyway
come on eli
did he say anything else
that you havent told me
well but im not sure
i heard it right
come on
it sounded like
dancing in the bucket
dancing in the bucket
uh-huh
at least that what it sounded like
got any idea what it could be
over the rim
dancing in the bucket
bucket
hey wait a minute
you just keep your mouth shut
hey jack over here
mr ward
yeah oh hi deputy
say what do you call
that contraption out there
tramcar
you see anything of him
around here we call it
the dancing bucket
who he looking for
charlie piper
old charlie one of the guys
that works here he missing
what he look like
he about 30 maybe 35
you seen anything
of a man about 60
grayish hair 5 well built
no nothing around here
but us chickens
you know what happened
one time a guy did end up
down there
can you imagine he got so busy trying
to get his ladder working he just
walked right over the edge
how do you figure that
how long has old charlie piper
been missing
i dont know for sure
he a watchman around here
on the weekends
when we come on today
he wasnt around
and you didnt think of
reporting this to the sheriff office
hold on
dont take me in yet
we dont think nothing
of it around here
when a guy missing
what do you mean
the work gets them
see the bucket out there
well that thing travels 9000 feet
across that canyon
to that cave on the other side
inside that cave
there about 500000 tons
of prehistoric bat guano
man that a lot of fertilizer
the only way
to get the stuff out
in that bucket
i figure old charlie
probably got tired
of shoveling the stuff
and riding the bucket
so he lit out
next thing you know
hell be sending us postcards
from las vegas or somewhere
hey jack
what about it
bill not a thing
all right bring it on in
it time we got back over
at the other side
and start hauling guano
ill ride back over with you
have you searched
the other side yet
nothing over there
but that cave and the cliff
and a lot of tired worn-out bats
well if you find anything
notify us will you
all right
want to ride over
and take a look for yourself
no thanks

i havent seen you
around the place before
oh im sorry dad
this is deputy
les martin sir
jim kendon
scotch rye or bourbon
well do you have
any beer around
wed be dead if we didnt
can all right
yes sir fine
what have you been doing
these days
besides chasing girls
and giving them tickets
they letting you in
on the murder case
you know that was my old office
where they found that man
yes we know
thank you
when was the last time
you were there sir
i havent used it since
the battle of gettysburg
the only time i go over there
is when i get lonesome
for the old days
well pleased to have met you
mr martin
id better be getting back
to my fossils
what kind of fossils
dad likes to wander up
and down the canyon
picking up rocks
he pretty much
retired these days
i think it makes him
a little sad to see the mines now
the way it does me
i go and wander around
the place sometimes
watch it fall apart
im sorry
do you want to sit down
oh no thanks miss kendon
ive got to get back to work
youre a real dedicated
public servant arent you
not dedicated enough
im afraid
why do you always look as though
you have something on your mind
well because i have
one thing ill regret
the rest of my life is
chasing you the other day
to give you that ticket
why officer martin
that the most gallant thing
ive ever heard
yup that me
gallant but stupid
while i was handing out
speeding tickets
that when the man
was being killed
well thanks for the drink
miss kendon
i didnt know
im sorry
ward hi
you got something
remember that fellow i said
had taken off for las vegas
yeah
not so sure about him now
that his watch
one of my boys found it
up the canyon
at the rim
close to it
it was over by a boulder
well you know
even a dollar watch
wears out sometime
maybe he just
threw this away
not charlie piper
like a kid about that watch
sort of a lucky piece you know
you dont think
hed have gone to vegas
without this huh
i dont think
hed go anywhere without it
i cant hear them
that because you never knew kendon
the way it used to be
you know there were
0000 people living here
when the mines
were going full steam
oh it was
a wonderfully noisy place
the clatter of the big mills
and the whine of the conveyor belts
and every now and then
a great big beautiful explosion
and all day long
kids laughing
and playing and howling
at each other
it was a rip-roaring town too
you know scotty saloon
was just one of seven
dance hall girls
say methuselah
how old are you
it was less than 20 years ago
look at it now
yeah
you know for a few moments there
i thought i could hear it too
welcome to the club
let me ask you something
is it possible
there could still be
a lot of gold here
without you people
knowing about it
are you kidding
youre sitting on $20 million
worth of gold
and practically everybody
knows about it
during the war the government had to
close down all the gold mines
because they needed
the manpower
well the war over
what are they waiting for
for the price of gold to go up
i dont see anything wrong
with $35 an ounce
nothing wrong with it
in other countries
where there a free market
it averages about $50 an ounce
oh well that is a difference
$24000 a hundred pounds
darn right it a difference
mm-hmm
my father spent a fortune
sending me to college in new york
to make me ladylike and dainty
you come along and in five minutes
im just a miner brat again
i think you still look
ladylike and dainty
ill slug anyone who says i dont
with all this gold here how come
they have only one man guarding it
oh eli not here to guard it
he just keeps the fences in repair
so that the tourists
wont fall down the mine shafts
and that concludes
the lesson for today
all right teacher
here we go
oh
tell me les what do you do
when you finish a day work
go home
get your notes in order
oh i generally
hang around the pool hall
sometimes i get in with a group
to go stealing hubcaps
you need some recreation
you mean like a hobby
like stamp collecting
why dont you find yourself a nice
intelligent well-rounded girl
take her out
for dinner and dancing
i think youre well-rounded
you might try my house
say 700 tomorrow evening
that sounds like a dare
oh it is
all right youre on
tomorrow at 700
lightweight gloves
keep an eye out for cops
hey what are you
doing down there
what the hell business
is it of yours
get up out of there
what your name
suds reese
what are you doing here
minding my own business
that what
im hitchhiking my way
out of this lousy state
so i stopped for a couple of beers
and im sleeping them off
in a gold mine
i just wanted a cool place to sleep
you county cops got nothing to do
but give me a hard time
wait a minute
where did you get those
theyre a graduation present
from me mother
yeah
you must have skipped
a couple of grades
you shouldnt
get your hands up
keep em up
now turn around
spread your feet come on
i ought to break your neck
what are you trying to pull huh
no wonder you didnt want me
to look at these rew
mr reese if you want
to leave this state ever
you better have a real good story
about where you found those
what kind of a way
is that to talk
i found them
laying back down there
and you had no idea
who to give them back to right
i dont know any rew
reese youre coming down
to kingman with me
just to make sure you dont
all right get going
you heard me
come on now
what going on out here
ive had
enough trouble out of you
book him for assault and battery
and suspicion of murder
murder
suspicion of murder huh
this guy sure gets around
considering he just got out of jail
in prescott late yesterday
late yesterday in prescott
you know this guy
he one of my star boarders
suds reese
he likes it
dont you sudsie
sure you got the best
county jail in the county
then why did he slug me
when i started to look
at these binoculars
old sudsie like that
look at the initials rew
that certainly could be re wallace
where did you get them
like i told this joker
i found them
sorry les probably true
anyway we can book him
for assault and battery
sheriff the county attorney
on the telephone again
ill take it in my office
lock him up
come on les
you might as well
be in on this too
ive met
county attorney houghton
he doesnt think very much
of the sheriff department
the feeling mutual
mr houghton
sheriff edwards
oh that very reassuring
mr edwards
people around town
are beginning to wonder
if we still have a sheriff
i have in my office
the mayor and mr sanford
of the kingman dispatch
they have the feeling that
though you may be on the case
youre not doing anything about it
well we are matter of fact
i got something on it this morning
communication on charlie piper
los angeles police department
the old goat just bluffing
shuffling papers
if we dont win the election
it wont be his fault
here it is
arrested for hijacking a truck
beat the rap
apparently the county attorney
down there wasnt doing his job
july 6 953 was tried and convicted
for the burglary of a warehouse
yeah yeah must have been
a different county attorney
edwards ill tell you one thing
neither one of those county attorneys
would have gotten a conviction
if youd been sheriff
because your mr piper
would never have been arrested
in the first place
look sam why dont you take care
of your department
and let me take care of mine
sam houghton backed my opponent
the last time i ran for sheriff
it would make him very happy
if we dont solve this case
matter of fact it might lose me
the next election
you mean for both our sakes
id better make some progress huh
you got the message
what are you
all dressed up for
im not all dressed up
youve got shoes on
it gets cold
around here at night
if you must know i have
a young man calling for me
obviously you cant think
too much of him
if youre not even going
to keep him waiting
hi
hi
how are you sir
fine thanks
how about a drink
ill intoxicate him
come on les
let live dangerously
and take my car huh
not that dangerously
you can drive
well in that case
good night sir
good night
i keep coming back
to one theory
could somebody be sneaking gold
out of your father mine
your somebody would have
to sneak it out by the truckload
to make it worthwhile
well if you had a big truck
and taking ways
where would you take the gold
ive been accused of having
fetching ways
but this is the first
this is hardly a big girl idea
of a gay night out
cant we talk about us
im just trying to protect you
somewhere in these hills
there a murderer on the loose
you frighten me
if you dont answer my question
im really going to frighten you
yes sir
well if i were stealing gold
we miners call it high-grading
id take it down to mexico
fifty dollars an ounce remember
would you have to know
a lot about mining
to discover a rich vein
yes and that the last
of your questions
where are you taking me mr deputy
to scotty
i want to ask him some questions
this is turning out to be
a fabulous evening
i was hoping to combine
business with pleasure
then let get down to business
ah here we are
thanks
looks like
your brother here
he always here
what else does bob do
he supposed to be
a geologist
supposed to
how that
well he just does it
to keep peace in the family
i wouldnt say he worked at it
or at anything else
for that matter
except flying maybe
mademoiselle kendon
reserved table up front
not too near the music
inspector
champagne of course
hi scotty
hi
ill join you in a minute
all right
come on
drinks are on me
hi sis
stud or draw deuces wild
you name it
why didnt you come home
last night
why should i
well dad and i
were worried about you
im sorry that you were worried
but i dont give a damn about him
look bobby
no one wants to interfere with you
boy when i think of you
driving those turns at night
absolutely pie-eyed
i drive better drunk
that because
youve had more practice at it
how the new fellow
and this is
the specialty of the house
for the carriage trade
ha speaking of
the carriage trade
have you seen
any strangers around
in a ghost town
what would they be doing here
well just in case if you do
anyone anyone at all
get in touch with me
right away will you
if i see any strangers here
im going to grab them
pull them in here then roll them
then ill call you
you have my blessing
youre a little premature
you usually get
what youre after
i cant get you to stop drinking
youve got to lose sometime
youve got to stop sometime
tell you what ill do
ill cut for it
see it impossible
okay but take it easy huh
you too sis
hey scotty
how about another drink
for an arm of the law
youre very light on your feet
and on yours
youre a lot younger
than your jokes
where did you learn to cha-cha
i sent away
for a mail-order course
but the left foot never arrived
are you tired
uncle
im glad you said it first
when youre not
drag racing with policemen
or rinsing out your brother
what do you do to keep busy
im a domestic
when summer comes
dad pretends the housekeeper
needs a long vacation
so i keep house
for him and bobby
uh-huh what do you do
in the winter
now i know
why you became a policeman
you just like to sit around
asking questions
it my turn now
all right
what did you do
before speeding tickets
and the cha-cha
well actually
i started out to be a lawyer
mail-order
university of colorado
i passed my bar exams
i practiced for two years
in boulder city
but i
it just didnt get me
not enough excitement
not enough fresh air
i guess
then what
on one of the cases
i was handling
i met a police sergeant
from denver homicide
and his job seemed much
more interesting than mine
so i became a policeman
homicide
a detective
mm-hmm
that interesting
were you a good detective
they seemed to think so
there was even talk of running me
for district attorney
id have voted for you
another round please
well you cant finish
the chapter there
no personal life
no policewomen
well i did meet a girl
we fell in love got married
had three wonderful years
then she became ill
everyone was
very understanding
i couldnt keep my mind
on what i was doing
and   i messed up
a terribly important case
the department
was kind of glad to see me go
and when she died
i just couldnt stay in the same town
we dont have to talk about it
if youd rather not
oh it finished now i think
i became somewhat of
a drifter for a while
i had nowhere to go
nothing to do
until i ran into sheriff edwards
here in kingman
he knew about me
and practically bullied me
into becoming a deputy
bless his overweight old heart
ill go along with that
and what about the future
you could still run
for district attorney
well the main thing at the moment
is to do a good job right where i am
there nothing to stop you
hello deputy
good evening mr houghton
miss kendon do you know
mr houghton our county attorney
yes weve met
im glad to see
youre relaxing
someone ought to tell him
that all work and no play
makes jack a dull boy
yeah well i think
id better start getting real dull
check please
i dont know about you
but mr houghton just lost a vote
mine
on radio
im sorry mad dog
you wouldnt have it
any other way
well lieutenant
i guess that closes the books
on mad dog cooley
shouldve listened to em mad dog
well you couldnt have picked yourself
a better time to have dropped in
i just made a discovery
that fellow who was murdered
is sitting right here next to mr kendon
look
oh here have yourself an apple
while i phone the sheriff
oh peel it
is this the coroner inquest
yes miss kendon
according to
your previous testimony
before coming here
you were a lieutenant
in the homicide division
of the denver police force
yes sir
youre experienced
in homicide cases therefore
well yes sir
ive had some experience yes sir
perhaps you can explain
why you seem to have
no leads at all
as to the murderer identity
as i explained
in my previous testimony
is this your testimony
about your discovering this body
or the body earlier this week
or the body last week
when you have
as many murder cases as we have
you have to be
a little more specific
im sorry
were talking about
three unsolved murder cases
we have three bodies
it could be we have
only one murder case
while the manner of these three deaths
shows no similarity
we believe there
a strong connection between them
would you mind defining
that connection
when i can define it
that will close the case
we know generally
that john doe and eli jones
had met shortly before
john doe was hanged
both men died
in the same place
a place that visited by probably
not more than a dozen people a year
the office of the inactive
gold mine at kendon
mm-hmm
and the third man
charles piper
we know that charles piper
leaped or fell
or was pushed over
the rim of the grand canyon
at granite gorge
yes but we dont know why
when we know why
well probably know who
well that a well-made phrase
mr deputy
let go back to denver
thank you
the last case
that you handled there
involved the murder
of a 6-year old boy
one harris knight
now according to
my investigation
now wait a minute sam
this has nothing to do with this inquest
and you know it
i know nothing of the kind
but i do know this
im the county attorney
responsible to the good citizens
of mohave county
and theyre very upset
with good reason
over these three
unsolved murders
mr coroner it up to you
to see that he sticks to the inquest
id like to answer him sheriff
might as well
have everything out
you may continue the questioning
mr martin
according to my investigation
you had the police department in denver
holding the wrong man for trial
it wasnt until
you were relieved of your job
and another officer replaced you
that the true murderer
was found and convicted
yes sir
in other words you were guilty
of several mistakes
and some carelessness
in the matter of harris knight
yes sir
and then again
according to your testimony
the deceased eli jones
intercepted you
on the morning of the 6th
of this month
and he begged you
to come with him
to interview a john doe
a man known as
re wallace
who was killed later the same day
in the kendon mine office
now have i made
any misstatements of fact
up to this point
no sir
according to your own report
you disregarded eli jones request
and went chasing after a girl
i wasnt chasing after any girl
i was taking care
of a traffic violation
you gave her a ticket
yes i did
what was the ticket for
forty-five miles an hour
in a 25-mile zone
well that doesnt sound
so serious to me
certainly not as serious
as murder
or even a request
for help from eli jones
when eli jones asked for help
i didnt know of any murder
and i did see somebody
breaking the law
you can call it a mistake
only now after the fact
you made a mistake
in the case of eli jones
and john doe
you made a mistake in denver
in the matter of harris knight
now why should we have
any reason to assume
that there wont be further mistakes
i cant give you any guarantee
nobody can
mr county attorney
our sole purpose here is to establish
the identity of the deceased
and to determine the cause of his death
mr coroner
im just trying to do my job
and i assume that all of us
are trying to do the same
it seems clear to me
that those of us
who havent met with
violent death so far
might be reassured
if there were fewer mistakes
and more progress
perhaps this entire community
would all feel a little more secure
if someone with a different record
was handling this case
you seen the morning paper
you want my resignation
no i dont want your resignation
but if this sort of thing keeps up
im going to have to accept it
hey martin youve got
a stack of unanswered
phone calls out here
janice kendon called
miss kendon called to report
she a missing person
janice kendon would like
would like to send you
a food package where
i see at least you
got the messages
he been working
like a dog miss kendon
he is a dog
not being a girl
you cant imagine
how embarrassing it is
if you keep chasing a man
and he keeps hiding from you
im sorry
all right deputy
put your hat back on
and take the silly look off
youre gonna buy me
a hamburger
all right youre on
ill just put these things away
oh i had a professor
of medieval history
had a jacket almost like this
yeah in new york
of course
that where norman james is
who norman james
your history professor
he is the man who makes these jackets
with the funny little round lapels
oh les you are a country boy
back in the effete east
you could be ostracized
for asking a question like that
what are you talking about
norman james is the most exclusive
gentlemen tailor in new york
and this jazzy lapel
and these crazy pockets
are his trademark
where could i find
this norman james
would he be in
the new york telephone book
you dont think hed have
an unlisted business number
he not all that exclusive
what that for
for being the best girl
a deputy ever had
well hey
how about my hamburger
stay right there
ill get you a truck
full of hamburgers
rush this out will you
to new york police department
contact immediately
norman james
norman james made suit
as described for only one customer
randall e whittemore
claiborne towers new york
whittemore executive vice president
of kendon mining corporation
currently on extended business trip
pretty smart of you
to recognize that jacket
we hicks out here probably
never would have known about it
janice recognized it
do you think mr kendon
is connected with this somehow
well let face it
he and whittemore belonged
to the same company
daughter recognized the jacket
what if you go out
and have a little talk with kendon
yeah
on second thought
itd probably take
half the time if i went out there
well if you want
no no
you know your way around
besides why send
an old man to do a boy job
hi
hi
id like to see
your father
my father
isnt this rather sudden
it line of duty
oh well he and bob
are fighting again
theyre in the den
did you find out
about the jacket
yeah
well that good
youre getting somewhere
i dont know
this case is better in some ways
worse in others
well not discuss
it any further
that fine with me
because im sick of it
dad
mr martin is paying us
an official visit
howdy
hi
well which one of you
two in trouble this time
oh theyre not in
any trouble sir i am
oh
uh mr kendon
when was the last time
you saw mr re whittemore
randall whittemore
yes sir
let see
last may at the stockholder
meeting in new york
you havent seen him since
no why
well the man
who was found dead
at the kendon mine office
was mr re whittemore
what
yes sir
oh no
im afraid ill have to ask you
to come down
and identify him
at the morgue
of course
this is shocking
you didnt even know
he was coming out here
i had no idea
hello yes he here
just a minute
bob it for you
who is it
i dont know a man
mr kendon
isnt it kind of strange
hello oh
his not getting in
touch with you
yes it is strange
why dont you sit down
ill be there right away
i wonder
i wonder
what he was here for
my guess is he found
someone was taking ore
out of the kendon mine
i think youre on the wrong track
first place
you dont just walk into a mine
and fall over
a high-grade pocket
you have to know
something about gold mining
a lot of people around
here know about that
yes
but even after you
discover the ore
you still have to
blast it out
now that hard to do
quietly
do you have to blast
i suppose under
some circumstances
you could get it out
with jackhammer and pick
but you still
have to get it out
and sell it somewhere
taking a few hundred pounds
of gold ore at a time say
six or seven
thousand dollars worth
you could load it onto a truck
or even a small plane
yes i suppose so
excuse me
i think ill make
some coffee
none for me thanks
mr kendon
have you told me
everything you know
about this case
what do you mean
i dont have to steal
from my own mine
im sorry
i have to ask you
these questions
where she going
i have no idea
you have any idea
where bob went
well if he not in a bar
where he probably is
he might be out
at the crop duster strip
where we keep
the old company plane
ill be back
that will be a pleasure
i can forego
you know youre not
supposed to call me
at home
well merciful heavens
look who got out of the wrong side
of the bed this morning
you know who was there
when you called
the deputy sheriff
no
let finish loading the plane
i dug it all myself
and then were off to rio
rio are you crazy
why the sudden change
in our plans
we sell the stuff in mexico
and then we head south
kid i know places in rio
that make las vegas
look like a sunday afternoon
in philadelphia
you know you remind me
of charlie piper
i had him figured
for a lazy loafer
from the start too
im glad i got rid of him
i got news for you
if i could fly this crate
i wouldnt need you either
you mean you killed
charlie piper
oh i should have but i didnt
what a character just like you
never did anything right
i give him a job
busting up some rocks
he lets an old geezer
with a trick suit
catch him at it
so i said to him all right
charlie let him follow you
up to the canyon
then you shove him over the edge
gets into a fight
and he cant even lick
an old man
who going to take care of him
good old scotty
that cold-blooded murder
oh come off it kid
this might have been
a cut caper of yours
to get back at your old man
for being twice the man you are
me i went along for the loot
that worth the lives
of two men
two chuckles
i forgot to tell you about eli
you murdered eli
what do you want from me
he sees a picture of the old snooper
up on the office wall in kendon
if i dont get rid of him
and the picture
everybody in the
whole county would know
who the guy was
they already know
know who
the headman of the whole
mining combine that all
well now dont that
take the cake
before the day over
theyre going to know who we are
here we are all wrapped up
snug as a bug in a rug
and ready to roll
now you go to work
daddy-o
we put on the lap strap
turn on the no smoking sign
and away we go
no
oh kid come on
dont be that way
if i said anything
about your old man
you didnt like
ill apologize
all along the way

to make megan co-captain
and you said okay
when ive always been
the only captain
brooke i cant tell coach carr
that a girl
who perfectly qualified
did it occur to you that
im the best one for the job
or that megan has never
choreographed a single routine
because she sucks at it
you are like everyone else
you think everything i get
is because im your daughter
i hate you being principal
i dont even have a mom anymore
brooke i wish
you wouldnt say that
well the truth hurts
doesnt it principal tippit

our captain

the fab five run this school
brooke lisa ashley
all of them
theyve been doing exactly
as they please for years
but since the pep rally
i thought that
did you really think a pep rally
was gonna make a big difference
with those girls
brooke brooke
i need to talk to you
look mom not right now
look i have to go to practice
i need to talk to you now
tabitha run on ahead
just go
yes maam
miss durant just dropped off
a disciplinary-action referral
for what
for phone use in class
for you and lisa
so
look you know
how intense she is
always getting uptight
over nothing
coach carr came in with her
and she wants to give you and
lisa demerits for the offense
are you kidding me
i cannot tell you
how royally pissed i am
yeah at me
no
at coach carr
i didnt hire her to go
on a witch hunt for demerits
now why dont you tell me
your version of what happened
you dont have a choice
you are getting 0 demerits
no im not
not unless mr spretnik says so
and he wont
how could you do that
write me up without even
asking me what happened
okay first of all
i didnt write you up
mrs durant did
second of all
it doesnt matter what happened
you girls did what you did
and you have to face
the consequences
so if youre not
gonna sign this
im gonna be talking
to mr spretnik
at the end of the day
what is your malfunction emma
well at the moment
it your tone
so please
watch how you talk to me
brooke
brooke
brooke
do you really think
i want to give you demerits
after all the hard work
youve done
i was crushed
when miss durant told me
you called lisa
in the middle of class
i thought
you were better than that
yeah that what i thought
about you too
and believe me i wont ever
make that mistake again
and by the way um
my mom wants to see you
in her office
now
o0 c so youre saying we
cant for phone use in class ts
no jeri had just found out
that her boyfriend
was cheating on her
with ashley of all people
apparently
jeri said she felt suicidal
and lisa was worried about her
which is why
she picked up the phone
if that was why
she answered the phone
you know these girls
how they play with the truth
to avoid consequences
look whether it true or not
i think it wrong
to let this slide
i really want to instill
a sense of accountability
in those girls
it not your job
to hold them accountable
it my job
and it mr spretnik job
i would appreciate it
if youd do your job
and get the squad ready
for the game tonight
i know it seems
im being argumentative
i just
i want to do a good job here
i want to do a good job for you
youre new at this
and you havent learned yet
that the people above you
with years of experience
have good reasons
for their decisions
i need you to start
figuring that out
you should be warming up
for tonight game
well we just wanted to know
if we had to sign
the demerit book
i think you already know
the answer to that
we need at least two
six-packs so jeri you go in

hey coach carr
will you take a video of us
please
you guys really dont care
about what you do
or how it affects other people
do you
look all we did
was make a stupid video
it was supposed to be funny
the jocks around here
make sex jokes
and act obscene all the time
no one throws a fit about that
i guarantee you if they were
in their uniform and off campus
theyd be in big trouble
so then it okay
as long as were on campus
jeri when youre
in your uniform
you represent this whole school
you represent everyone else
on your squad
do you realize that anyone
who watches this video
is going to think jackson
cheerleaders are a bunch of
trashy sluts
i am so disappointed in you
coach carr disappointed in us
well i guess i shouldnt be
i mean you did warn me
that all you care about
is getting noticed
so congratulations brooke
youre finally getting noticed
you four are gonna sit out
until the district decides
what your punishment will be
well see what my mom says
about that
you do realize that in college
you wont be able
to run to your mother every time
you dont like something
here it obviously
your time of the month

o0 c pamela the video
showed the girls drinking alcohold
according to the cheerleading
constitution
they should actually be removed
from the squad please
i just read that 80%
of all high-school students
drink on occasion
it ridiculous
to expect our girls
to behave like it 950
look i dont
want lisa drinking
but i should be the one
to handle it
not our little
cheerleading coach
we pay what 500 bucks so our
girls can be cheerleaders try $800
$800 okay
we paid our money
let let em cheer
you know im not gonna appeal
im trying to keep myself
out of this
lorene come on
you could at least back us up
or get your
little miss sunshine coach here
to back off
if coach carr thinks
were trashy sluts
she gonna get trashy sluts
lord
the sun just came out
whoo
almighty that is sexy
unh-unh no way
ive let a lot slide
with you girls
but this
the way youre dressed unh-unh
what wrong with the way
were dressed
you know exactly
what im talking about brooke
are you looking at her boobs
you perv
i want you
i want all of you right now
to get down to the office
get permission to go home
and change
go
i dont think so
excuse me
you get out of my classroom
right now brooke
you know what
you might as well get
your panties out of a wad
because were not
going anywhere
so what should we talk about
today class
miss brooke
yes jeri
um let talk about
how trevor called me last night
and said that ashley
is so crap in bed
and that she makes sounds
like a monkey
really
aw poor little baby
i got a banana for you
run slut run
what are you looking at
nothing
it just
doesnt feel so good
to be on the other side
of it all does it
i was never as mean as brooke
and jeri are being to me
i was never that cruel
yes you were
you were exactly like them
so i went
to mr spretnik yesterday
about brooke
already having nine absences
in my class this year
and this morning i see this
wait that says
she been absent three times
exactly
it been changed
yesterday it says nine
this morning it says three
and i didnt change it
could one of the girls
have accessed the server
yeah it possible
but it also possible
they didnt have to
because someone in that office
did it for them
you know i tried to avoid
doing what everybody else here
does
and that just hunker down
watch the calendar
and wait for those little
monsters to graduate
but if it gonna be like this
screw it
im done fighting
i dont care anymore
jeri mom appealed
tabitha mom lisa dad
brooke do you have any idea
how hard this is for me
look this isnt fair
no one would care
about that video
if you werent my mom
youre probably right
which is why i dont know
whether to ground you
or feel sorry for you
why dont you just bite me
okay you know what brooke
youre grounded
go ahead
try it lorene
im gonna call daddy
ill tell him
if i cant live with him
then ill disappear
and this time
neither of you will ever
see me again
and that a promise
it central office
that was unnecessary
lorene tippit
hello mr tompkins
yeah fine thank you
i could not agree with you more
yes
thank you so much for calling
i will
that was vern tompkins
and he has decided
to reduce the suspension
to 5 days plus probation
yeah well no thanks to you
the parents dont want the girls
to have consequences
the school doesnt want em
to have consequences
and now even the district
is backing off
so if no one else cares
why should i be the one
beating my head
against the wall
because it not like you
to back down
from fighting
for what you think is right
well maybe i should start doing
what people with more experience
are doing
and all theyre doing
is watching the calendar
until the fab five are gone
so fine i can do that too
what do you want me to say
that it okay
not to rock the boat
cause it is i mean ive been
in the corporate world
i know how futile it is
why do you think i went back
to get my degree
hon i know you think
cheerleading is
some high holy mission
but it not like
there are lives at stake here
maybe youre right
im just not feeling that good
im gonna make some tea
do you want some
no im fine
thanks
okay
okay so were gonna go
low v high v

it so stupid to waste
a buzz here fine
here
come on
some adventure
getting frisky
im fricking hungry
tab kill this
go go go
um
um
he hot
you pulled this car out
way too fast young lady
you have an off-campus pass
no but we have permission
to leave
if you dont have a pass
then you need to park your car
do you know who i am
yes i do
now park the car
look okay
you can go call mr spretnik
on your little radio
and hell tell you
were allowed to leave
hey joe
what going on
hey there blt
you girls need to get
out of this car right now
o0 c
could we be any more fascinating
to these losers
the curmudgeons are on time
you know
it really funny to me
this is actually a prop
for a health-class project
you know i found it
in the trash can
by the science lab
why dont why dont you girls
just tell me what happened
well now
we just took a huge test
and we were all tired
and we needed some fresh air
i was running and it was really
stupid of me but i fell
go figure
she scraped her knee
em
you got to hear this
everyone is saying
you were the one
that caught them
in the parking lot
you didnt write them up
no i didnt
but they were drinking
on school grounds
there was no alcohol
in the bottle
no proof they were drinking
and as for this skipping thing
i think there a lot
of gray area there
i mean the other squad captain
gave them permission to go home
who megan
since when can a student
give another student
permission to leave school
lorene
you have to write them up
keep pushing me
and i will dissolve this program
altogether
there will be
no more cheerleaders
and i will let everyone know
that youre responsible
now i have an appointment
lorene before you go
those girls have violated
their probation
they need to be removed
from the squad
i am not about to deliver
permanent consequences
for an offense
im not sure they committed
this isnt
about embarrassing stuff
on the internet anymore
they are becoming a danger
to themselves and others
this conversation is over
why do you help these girls
get away
with whatever they want
i know why lorene does it
she thinks
itll convince her daughter
that she loves her
but what in it for you
all right
you are becoming irrational
maybe you need
to take another day off
until youre feeling
wasnt it you that altered
brooke tippit attendance
record in coach reeve class
all right
youre completely out of line
this whole school
is out of line
and if youre not gonna
hold these girls accountable
for their actions
i will hold them accountable
as a squad
i will cancel all activities
outside the classroom
i will see them at practices
and that it
if youre refusing
to perform your duties
as cheerleading coach
then ill just accept that
as your resignation
no i am not resigning
you are gonna be dealing with me
until you handle this
the right way
why are you making us pay
for what they did
i know this is hard
to understand
but if rules are broken
there have to be consequences
and these are
the only consequences
i have in my power to deliver
you said you would never quit
on us
im not quitting
im trying to force a change
in discipline policy
can you understand that
yeah but im tired of them
getting away with everything
and making us all look bad
youre not hurting us
you know
youre just gonna make everyone
else hate you as much as we do
leave
make me
practice is canceled today
you can all go home early
ill let the office know
what are you still doing here
waiting for mr studdard
he said hed be here at 35
you went to central office
with your cheerleader problems
well i think he should know
what going on here dont you
do you know
what lorene gonna do to you
when she finds out
you went over her head
she left me no choice
she wont even talk to me
about it
now obviously
mr studdard wont either
what is wrong
with this district
everyone is just burying
their heads in the sand
hi
the girls were just telling me
about what happened today
and theyre pretty upset
about it
janice i need your help
come on in
wait
what going on here
after meeting with coach carr
and a number
of the booster parents
mr spretnik and i
have decided
that you girls
will be written up
for skipping class on tuesday
and this is because
of what she wants
most of the girls will receive
0 to 2 demerits total
but jeri already has 0
so 20 is now her total
and 20 means removal
from the squad
that it jeri
youre off the squad
really
i mean really
because my mom is gonna be very
interested to hear about this
this is twice now that youve
gotten me kicked off the squad
for what
what did i ever do to you
jeri this isnt about
what youve done to me
she is totally manipulating you
and youre letting her
arent you
arent you
answer me
answer me
so if youre wondering
why im giving you erasers
well weve had
a pretty rough time
and i know this is cheesy
but this is what
my high-school coach used to do
when she wanted us
to start fresh
and that what
this squad needs
a fresh start
would you like me to tell you
where you can put that eraser
disrespect to a teacher
is 0 demerits
so go ahead tell me
sorry coach
but im respectfully declining
your eraser
hey
did she say anything about me
no
she just gave us these you took it
why didnt you tell her
to stick it up her ass
why didnt you
you know what
this is our squad our school
we were here before that bitch
and you know what
were gonna be here
after she gone
someone should know about it and
you say this um this affair has been going on
since before last semester
yes sir
i definitely
heard coach carr say to him
what if your wife
finds out
all right well just keep this
to yourselves all right
ill take care of it
i need you to come with me
and sit through the first round
of pamela blackburn appeal
over jeri being removed
from your squad
at camp this summer
did you or did you not
encourage the girls
to break curfew
and go with you to buy tape
for the purpose of playing
pranks on the other girls
yes but i didnt
consider it breaking curfew
because they were with me
and did you let them get away
with sending
a sexually explicit message
to coach reeve
from your cellphone
no i didnt let them
get away with it
but you didnt give them
any formal punishment
so if you let them
break some rules and not others
how are they supposed to know
where you draw the line
the line at school
is very clear
drinking is not allowed
neither is skipping class
did you frequently flirt
with coach reeve a married man
in front of the girls
lorene why am i the one
on trial here
were supposed to be discussing
jeri behavior issues
emma you cant kick a girl
off the squad
and not have questions raised
about how that came about
im curious

ive been trying to tell you
she psycho
my mom says coach carr
an embarrassment
she said she mostly
embarrassed for you
superintendent tompkins
told my mother
he doesnt know
why you ever hired her
so i read your e-mail
to the girls several times
and i do have one question
you wrote whether or not i
continue this journey with you
you do realize that your journey
here at jackson is over right
may i tell the girls
before i go
no you may not
youre to leave campus
immediately
what do you want
we just heard
youre not our coach anymore
i guess someone
didnt want you here
you girls always get
what you want dont you
yeah you could say that
you know for a while there
i thought you girls
were actually on your way
to becoming
shut up
get out of our school
i feel the most sorry
for you brooke
you have so much potential
and you just drove away the one
person willing to help you
the meeting was a joke
22 parents signed a letter
demanding your reinstatement
and mr studdard tried
to stop us from reading it
why did they bother
to hold the meeting
if they had no intention
of listening to us
how are the girls doing
they feel abandoned
lorene told them
you quit on them
i know
it only going to get worse
tv reporter called me
she doing a story
about the video on the internet
and the questions she asked
it gonna be
a cheerleaders gone wild
what is this reporter name
youre not thinking
of talking to her
maybe i can talk her
out of doing the story
i doubt that
it airing tonight
well then i better go
what the station name
what if she asks you
for an interview
then ill do an interview
coach emma carr said she tried
to bring order to the team
leveling punishments
for offenses
ranging from skipping classes
to posting a sexually
suggestive video
on the internet
the jackson high school
administration
declined our request
for an interview
carr said that her attempts
to why theyd blur our faces
shh shh shh
by the high-school principal
lorene tippit
who has a daughter on the squad
yes i mean some of the girls
behaved badly
but the real problem
were the adults
the school administration
enabled them
the school district
refused to take interest
and the girls parents
did everything they could
to help them avoid consequences
you know
we are totally famous
feeling paris hilton
more of a lindsay lohan vibe
with a touch of britney
and her sister
girls it good to be bad
the school board is very unhappy
about the publicity
very unhappy
once i realized
how unstable coach carr was
i asked for her resignation
well the board has asked me
to hire
an independent investigator
to look into discipline issues
at jackson
but there are no discipline
issues at jackson
the problem here
was an immature teacher
who wasnt up to the job
and is now using the media
to spread lies
yeah i know
and were releasing a statement
to that effect
now we expect the investigator
to tell us the same thing
can you assure me
his investigation
will tell us the same thing
i promise you vern
i will make sure
that everyone at jackson
cooperates
with your investigator
okay
it not true that i get
special treatment here
if anything
people are even harder on me
because my mom the principal
i would agree
it not easy being
the principal daughter
people watch her
they hold her
to a different standard
i work 40 hours a week
so i cant watch tabitha
every moment
yet she motivates herself
to get good grades
do volunteer work
and work her ass off
as a cheerleader
she was so hot for coach reeve
shed ignore us
to flirt with him
here i took this picture
of them on my phone
i know a few parents
are asking
for her reinstatement
and i hope
they do bring her back
then i can sue this school
for my daughter
emotional suffering
mom mom if you would just
let me please stop
mother just let me explain
im trying to mom
ill take cindy in first
she the most nervous
so was it weird
if youre wondering whether
i told the truth or not i did
even though certain people
are gonna hate me
the rest of my life
yeah but other people
are gonna respect you
for telling the truth
yeah like who
i mean if you havent noticed
i dont have friends anymore
well you could
you could have
a whole squad full of them
if you wanted them
hello
emma it helen and adam
god it so good
to hear from you guys
lorene forbid everybody on staff
to speak to you
youre kidding me
well then why are you calling
so i could tell you
how pissed i am
that youre dragging us
into this investigation thing
stop it
he not mad at you
it just the investigator
was grilling him
about the two of you
asking if there was
a sexual relationship
if you had every acted
inappropriately with him
yeah my wife wants to know
why theyre asking
that question
god i am so sorry
i dont see the point
of all this emma
it not like youre gonna
be able to take lorene down
im not trying to take her down
im just trying
to change things for the girls
you should be trying
to get your job back
i just hope this investigator
gonna find out the truth
they didnt hire him
to find the truth em
you look
a little uncomfortable
that because
i am uncomfortable
with the process or with me
i welcome the process
i just dont trust you
from what i hear
youve been paid
to hang me out to dry
this isnt
a very auspicious start
well you did say
you wanted me to be honest
yes i did
what are you doing here
talking to the investigator
he not gonna believe
a word you said
do you know what
all this means for you
my life is exactly the way
i want it to be
is that right
with this video of you
on the internet
and the stories in the media
do you really think
that usc gonna accept you
as a student
let alone a song girl
after conducting
over 70 interviews
i believe ive identified
the source of the problems
with the cheerleading program
as you know the most recent
coach emma carr quit
in an untimely fashion
then unwisely took her accounts
to the media
however
i find her actions
understandable
given the problems
she encountered at jackson
problems centered on a popular
group of cheerleaders
who were highly resistant
to authority
these girls were literally given
carte blanche
to behave as they pleased
by their parents
and by the school
administration
regrettably i found
that jackson principal
lorene tippit failed to juggle
two of the most important
responsibilities in her life
principal and mother
and it is she who is accountable
for this situation
we find ourselves in today
entertain me
why arent the four of you
in class
were just waiting for my mom
to get out of her meeting
and of course
this takes all four of you
that the fab four
to you reeve
i have been placed
on suspension
and so has mr spretnik
the report faulted me
when all ive ever tried to do
is keep you out of this mess
okay you know what
dont blame us
because your investigator
turned out to be a stupid moron
you know what brooke
you will never talk to me
like that again
now go clean out your locker
for what cause im
pulling you out of this school
like hell you are
this is my school
and my senior year
not anymore it not
go clean out your locker
or what
or your mother is gonna drag you
to it by your hair
excuse me miss tippit
what about us
i dont know what your parents
are gonna do with you
youre definitely gonna be
removed from the squad
your cheerleading days
in this district are over
let me get that for you
there you go watch the
miss tippit
brooke
miss tippet
id like to have a word
do you have any comment
please give us a comment
any comment brooke
please people are asking
go away
brooke anything
that youd like to say
anything you would like to say
any comments
miss tippit any comments
do you have any comments
miss tippit please comments
any comments miss tippet
tell us about what going on
in the school
coach carr
coach carr
coach
coach carr
please can we get a comment
anything please
of course im disappointed
superintendent tompkins decided
not to let me have my job back
i loved being a coach
i loved being a teacher
but this whole thing
it not about me
and i know you guys
are gonna continue
to call this a real life
mean girls story
but it not even
about what the girls did
it about
how they felt entitled
to the way
they were being treated
by the lack of boundaries
and i think all of us
we have an obligation
to set boundaries
and stick by them
thought youd be happier
the report vindicated you
yeah but jobs were lost
reputations were ruined
and for what
what difference
did i really make
maybe i shouldnt be here
you were invited
yeah by janice
but what if the girls
dont want me to be here
well if you dont want
to say hi to the girls
because you think it gonna
make them uncomfortable
we can just watch them perform
and then go
okay
emma
emma over here
how are you
you got here just in time
janice
franklin madison high school

i missed you
hi guys
were so glad to have you here

inconvenient time

is the file you asked for
thank god i caught you christine

i just walked through the door cj
where have you been
europe as usual
stanley left some instructions
that involve dan
and ive gotta find him
he surprised the hell out of me in
brussels
he sent me a postcard
the only part i can make out is
dear christine
at least i think that dear you
know what his handwriting is like
then there something here about
climbing a mountain
did he happen to mention which
mountain
see that peak straight ahead
that where well be
tomorrow at this time
grab a couple
of lungs full of this
pity the poor bastards in the cities
who dont get to taste real air anymore

hello hello jeff
up here these cb patches pick up
a lot of dx noise
you want me to try
getting him again
no that okay
well be getting downhill
thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies
thou anointest my head with oil
my cup runneth over
surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
all the days of my life
and i will dwell in the house of
the lord for ever
i dont really know
when stanley left instructions
that he wanted me to uh
what do you call it say a few
words
i was surprised
mr
and i guess it only natural that
we keep right on disagreeing
i know seven other men who could
do this better
but im not about to file a
dissenting opinion
stanley morehead was
a gentleman of honest mind
you cant say that about many men
in this city
in this century
stanley and i were like a pair of
flying buttresses
leaning against opposite sides of
a gothic cathedral
we helped keep the roof from
caving in
if wed both been on the same side
all the time
we might have pushed the building
over
you dont have to agree with a man in
order to respect him
stanley and i had one argument
over and over again
i never won i never could win
he used to ask me
what in god name is the
practical use of mountain climbing
one time i said to him
wellon a mountaintop maybe youre
a little bit closer to god
he laughed and said dan what the hell do
you know about god
i do know this
mr justice stanley morehead is
not in any box
about to be covered by earth
he
fire
ready aim
fire
ready
aim fire
ready present arms
christine i think we should have
hired a limousine like the others
dan nonsense the fresh air will
do you good
alice looked awful
you know what burns me
today star brushed off stanley
whole life with two inches
and printed two full pages of
smart-ass speculation about his replacement
dan ill bet it a surprise
somebody nobody thought of
christine she doesnt have
many close friends
dan it always a surprise
especially for the guy who gets capped
christine maybe ill plan a small
dinner party for her after we
get settled
dan when the president gave me
the nod i was so surprised
i couldnt talk for a week
christine i dont think
i could stand
one of those terrible teas
with all those wives
could be anybody
a lot of good men around
a lot of lousy ones too
if i were alice
id go to europe
the warm part
how was europe
wet
how was your mountain
high
you have any idea who going to be
appointed
to what
the court
i never try to second-guess a
president
man moves into the white house
you have no idea what happens to his mind
i just hope he has an active membership
card in the human race
waldo hi ted
always feels like the first day of
school doesnt it
hope i never graduate
i dont know what wed do without
you dan
morning radabaugh anything
happen
everything that happened is on your desk
mr justice snow
still got the same cold
sinus
dan who there
mason woods sir
may i come in sir
of course you can come in what the hell do
you think youre here for
thank you sir
and you dont have to knock
it
yes sir
i
youre
too goddamn polite
stop being scared of me mason
you got the job
yes
sir
uh would you care for some tea mr justice
or a scotch
maybe id better have both
no i dont wanna overdo it
forget the tea
um now this supports your
position
on abbot vs omnitech
forget omnitech
but that at the top of the
order list
it gonna get struck
why
because my brave brethren
on the court
are too chicken-hearted
to hear it that why
when im getting ripped off
mason i want to know who doing the ripping
how much can these multinational
monsters get away with
i dont know and neither do you
because they keep hiding behind
all those tv commercials
saying how goddamn holy
they are
even the cj is scared to
hear omnitech
he says
it like telling god
you want to examine the books
peace up to a point
i tell you mason the most
dangerous thing in the world is to be cautious
people are always falling down the
ones who are afraid theyll trip over something
take a chance
yes sir
and dont always agree with me
if you think im wrong
and dont say so
then what the hell good are ya
i like law clerks who argue with me
yes sir
no sir
i mean ill try to do that sir
not to do that sir what this
this is collins vs california
it a kinky one that came up
from the ninth circuit
the berkeley student who wore a
t-shirt that said fuck the white house
did he
have his pants off
it doesnt say
well then i dont see any clear
and present danger
that he intended to implement the
opinion of his t-shirt
well the ninth circuit held it was offensive
to the public sensibility
just being offensive is not an
offense
one man pornography may be another
man poetry yes sir
yes yes yes yes yes yes
lady purity speaking from the
cloisters of california
free speech is not ipso facto
filthy speech
dirt is a splendid environment
for earthworms
but it is a grave for the human
mind
i wish to hell she didnt write so
goddamn well
you see mason that what this
court is for
to restrain the ruth loomises of
the world
sir i found this opinion
on surveillance
but you wont
have to read it
why not
you wrote it
well read it to me
i might have forgotten it or
changed my mind
when god created the world
he did it alone in private all
by himself
no monitors
no hidden microphones
he made it
the way he wanted it
but what if someone
had invaded god privacy
would he have put the world together
the same way
i doubt it
he wouldve made it a popular world
both and the garden of eden
would have turned out
like las vegas or 42nd street
would you like
to take any calls sir
uh ms radabaugh will get that
no she wont
chambers of
mr justice snow
oh
yes mrs snow
it your wife
but she doesnt want to bother you
youre not bothering me youre
interrupting me but youre not bothering me
how should i seat them this evening
i dont care how you seat em try
chairs
hello hello
what happened to radabaugh
she left early
sinus
she looked terrible
radabaugh been with me for 23 years
and she always looks terrible
how do you do that sir
do what
well you reach in there and find exactly
what youre looking for
in the middle of all that
all that  mess
to you it a mess to me it a
wilderness of free association
dont ever straighten up
my desk mason
id never be able
to find anything
always been suspicious
of neatness
if there nothing on top
of a man desk
he probably shoved
all the clutter into the drawers
and if his drawers are empty what
the hell does he need a desk for
may i come in dan sure
cj
how are you mr chief justice
uh im not sure
mind if i lie down on your couch
mason see if those t-shirts are
available on the open market
i
what t-shirts
none of your goddamn business
do i ask you about your underwear
how come your couches are
much more comfortable than mine
you know something cj
maybe ill give you that couch
as a going-away present
who going away
think of how many people would
bust a gut with joy if i retired
nah you wouldnt do that
to me dan
oh
i
yeah hmm
who the president going to pick
he already been appointed
who is he
mr justice snow
im gonna have to ask you to rephrase that question
a woman
he picked a woman
great
good for him itll be fun
who is it who is she who who
the president has just
sent up to the senate judiciary committee
the name of judge
ruth hagador loomis
of the ninth circuit
court of appeals
get off my couch i have to lie
down
now now dan
youre joking it a joke it
a joke isnt it
the president i am told
thinks he has made
a great progressive step in the history
of mankind
ruth loomis the mother superior
of orange county
what goes through a man head
when he makes an appointment like that
guess he was trying to be
evenhanded
president of all the people
the senatell never go for it
will they will they
forget it
where ms radabaugh
chambers of mr justice snow
it
no comment from mr justice snow at
this time
youre better than ms radabaugh
the president wants a woman on the court
why not pick ms radabaugh
shed be perfect
shed never show up
jeff why in god name do i get
a sinking feeling in my gut every time
i think about that woman sitting
on this court
it not because
she a woman
i like women
my wife a woman
the bench will smell better with
a little perfume on it
but ruth loomis
how can you just let it ring
telephone has no constitutional
right to be answered
dont pay any attention to it
itll go away
see
i hear she plays tennis
hitler played the harmonica
oh
she may not be so bad
she young
we could use some young blood
around here
and she isnt stupid
fix yourself a drink
i just might do that
here she is now come in
is it true
jack anderson on the phone
would either of you care to say
anything to him
yes ask him where im spending my
vacation next summer
i dont know but he probably does
ill just tell him neither of you is available
for comment
how does a newspaperman like jack
anderson
find out what happens in the oval
office so fast
simple he got a friend
in the soviet embassy
and im 0 minutes late
only one thing dan before you
consider resigning
resigning who the hell gonna
resign
you think id leave you here alone
and get sprayed down
by the lysol lady of orange county
and if that holy junta
at the white house
picked her to replace stanley
morehead
who in god name do you suppose
theyd send up to take my seat
shirley temple
5-2
bill change sides ill let you
take the sun for a while
not bad for a beginner am i
when are you gonna let me take you
someplace where i can win
dont you think a year is long enough
to be a practicing widow
seven months
dont rush me
am i on the list
youre at the top
public announcer judge loomis telephone
long distance call for judge loomis
sorry bill
senator im sorry these proceedings are taking so much time
but were breaking ground here
and i trust the committee questions
arent embarrassing you judge loomis
i dont embarrass easily senator
judge loomis
judge loomis about your interests and equities
would they influence your decisions on the high court
the financial statement in front of you is complete senator
when i was appointed to the ninth circuit
i disposed of anything that might possibly raise
a question of conflict of interest
thank you
but you were still married to a very active
and successful corporation lawyer
was i expected to dispose of him
according to this fbi report
you and your husband were partners in
the law firm of loomis and loomis
excuse me senator why do you keep bringing up my husband
when i was appointed to the federal bench
he took over the entire practice
it was a tremendous burden on him
it probably what killed him
did you ever represent omnitech international or its chairman
donald richards
no senator
youre quite sure about that
ruth quite sure
senator after you left is it possible
that the firm represented him
id have no knowledge of that
and since your husband death youve had no
contact with any member of that firm
ruth
none oh that not quite true
i do play tennis once in a while with bill russell
william russell
he joined the firm after i went to the bench
senator do you ever discuss legal business with him
no senator
do you think perhaps
youre a little too young judge loomis
to take these responsibilities on yourself
as i recall
mr justice snow was a year younger than i am
when he was appointed to the court
do you feel your decisions on the high court
might be influenced by the fact that
well youre a woman
i hope so
uh arent a man decisions influenced by the fact that he a man
for two centuries this court has expressed
men opinions
and perhaps it time for the majority of the population
to have one voice in nine in the
rulings of the supreme court
senator is the lady implying
that male justice is perverted
ruth havent we outgrown those fears about the periodic instability
of the female of the species
eggs are not the seeds of insanity
a woman can ovulate and think at the same time
senator were striving
to be objective
yes but really
what does sex have to do
with being a judge
somebody with the capacity to bear children
is gifted not crippled
a uterus is like absolute pitch
so me people have it some dont
well according to this fact sheet
judge loomis has never had any children
yes  but does the constitution say that a
supreme court justice has to be a mother
judge loomis we dont mean to probe into your personal life
why not
my entire life is public
the fbi is wrong in reporting to you
that i have no children
i have hundreds
we are the parents of our ideas
and uh so my children
in other words my opinions my decisions
are the result of conception
and the delivery is sometimes painful
you may not like my children
you may find them ugly
but by god your ideas and mine
have equal rights to live together
to grow to change even to die
if there are no further questions
the committee will consider an executive session
where well recommend to the full body of the senate
thank you judge loomis
thank you mr chairman
t hank you gentlemen
now let check it
just once more
mr justice carey
is now on this end
that correct then mr
justice webb
webb mr justice quincy
that him mr justice
snow
that right the cj stays
in the center of course
then mr justice halperin
okay
mr justice clewes
that him mr justice thompson
that right and the new
chair for justice loomis
on this end
that correct
does a lady need this
well tell her
it a wastebasket
good afternoon
welcome to washington
justice loomis
thank you everything
ready
great oh is the phone in
ah yes
the man left an hour ago
hello
ready for your coronation
bill
yes
how did you get this number i
dont even know it
well i do if it ever slips your mind just give me a ring
in the bedroom please
in the bedroom
im talking to the bellman
you idiot
it sweet of you to call
i just wanted to be the first man in recorded history
to ask a supreme court justice for a date
so noted
the clerk will put it on the docket
thatll take two years
not now that im in charge
mr agronsky
whenever youre ready
tape is rolling
this is an historic day for the
nation
and for the supreme court of the
united states
the court has been in session
since the first monday in october
which according to the judiciary
act of 789
marks the start of a new term
each year
no camera has ever photographed
the traditional robing ceremony
in the sanctum sanctorum of the court
and none is there today
since the death of justice stanley morehead
this has been an eight-man court
which as justice daniel snow has pointed out
resembles a four-man basketball team
today the vacancy has been filled
but this still remains an eight-man court
well where is she
maybe we ought to sound the
warning buzzer a little sooner
i suppose she has things to do
that we dont
after all i dont have anything
to do with my hair
agronsky this is
an historic occasion
like the jesuits going coed
suppose shell wanna hang
chintz curtains everywhere
i hate chintz
why am i nervous she the one who
should be nervous
now gentlemen things are not
going to be any different
from the way theyve been every
two minutes to 0 in the history of the court
now weve got to think of her
exactly as one of the brothers
good morning
justice loomis welcome
welcome to the court thank
you
good morning
good morning maam
thank you
for the lovely roses
uh
you dont send me roses anymore
cj
it 958 gentlemen and madam
justice
we shake hands
like this every day
every morning just before we take
the bench
like nine boxers coming in to a
ring
we shake hands before we knock each
other out
the honorable the chief justice
and associate justices
of the supreme court of the united
states
oyez oyez oyez
all persons having business
before the honorable the supreme court of the united states
are admonished to draw near and give their attention
for the court is now sitting
god save the united states and this honorable court
cj today orders
of the court
have been certified by the chief justice filed with the clerk
and will not be announced orally
probably the peak of every
lawyer career
is that moment when he is presented
and accredited to plead
before the highest court
in the land
only lawyers ever plead in that
hallowed chamber
but today all eyes are focused on the court newest newcomer
who has just received confirmation from the senate of the united states
court watchers will be fascinated in the weeks and months ahead
by the figure in the leather chair farthest to the left
of the chief justice
how will this feminine presence
affect what for two centuries
has been an all-male preserve
because so many states
have accepted pornography
as a way of life
does not mean that we are willing
to compromise our values
in the sovereign state of nebraska
ergo i beseech this
distinguished body
in its infinite and scholarly
wisdom
to uphold exalted standards of
morality
which this lofty court so
fervently advocates
and how rare it is
to find judicial minds
so attuned to the higher
reaches of the spirit
so understanding
of the basic values
we so dearly cherish
so incredibly sensitive to the
deep strains of decency
which constitute
the lapping tidewaters
of our heritage
the state of nebraska
contends that
herbert g maloney
knowing and willfully
perpetrated an obscene and foul
your time is up
may i be permitted
cj no
any questions gentlemen
madam justice
i get the impression
that the state of nebraska
would like to see this film
confiscated burned
and the ashes sent into space
is that the idea
if the court so recommended
is it your contention
that the constitution
gives this court
any such power
this court is the judge
of its own power
until we actually examine the film in
question i think that
may it please the court
i respectfully submit that my
client rights under the first amendment
the first amendment doesnt give
anybody the right
to commit acts which are harmful
to the public good
but this is an educational film
a major documentary a work of art
how can we judge that
until weve seen it
do any of the justices object
besides justice snow
i think it essential that we see
the film
alright then the clerk will
schedule a showing of the film
at some future date which is not
in conflict
with the schedule already on the
calendar
narrator if you saw lois
walking along
in the sunshine of beverly hills
you might think she was just a healthy ordinary girl
but lois has a problem
like the alcoholic who cannot stop with one drink
like the compulsive eater
who must consume one dessert after another
lois can never be satisfied
can never get enough of what she craves
why isnt
mr justice snow here
he never comes to these showings
narrator the average young woman wants one man
but lois is insatiable
have we missed much
the lady just
getting started
you guys get over there
and shut the door
narrator
we asked a distinguished physician
to give his opinion of lois condition
he has asked that his name be withheld
be cause of his high standing in the medical profession
dr x from the point of view of a man of science
what can be done for lois
th is sort of affliction is difficult to treat
let look at the other sex as lois sees them
oh let not
narrator
can lois ever be cured
or is she doomed to a life
of ever-increasing frustration
i dont know about lois but im
cured
havent we seen enough
narrator during the next hour
well try to show you
no i dont think so
projectionist
stop the film please
please
thank you does anyone object
no
not me
mr chief justice
are you stopping the film
because there a woman
in the room
no
you think im offended
of course im offended
but that no reason
to stop the film is it
cj
just a moment please
madam justice loomis as a man
i am somewhat embarrassed
that you have to sit here and watch this thing
i certainly can understand how harold
feels
i wouldnt want to sit through it
with my wife
or arrange a special showing for
mother day
but your wife and your mother
havent been appointed to this court
time is the point gentlemen and
madam justice
and we have a responsibility not
to waste it
i have seen enough to make my
decision
judges me too yes
i do apologize justice loomis
why
something is very wrong here
youre all so polite to me
im not being
too outspoken am i
no no
no
raise hell if you want to
you may be sorry
you said that
actually i do have one question
oh
how can mr justice snow
pass judgment on something
without even seeing it
hasnt he virtually
disqualified himself on maloney
would you like to suggest that to
justice snow
i dont think that one of my
privileges isnt it yours
well yes i suppose it is
and mr chief justice
id like to examine the rest of the film
if you dont mind
just to see if there a shred of redeeming
social or artistic value
projectionist
would you continue the film please
thank you
530 will be fine
howdy ben
good afternoon mr justice
how are you felling
just fine thank you

yes sir
hi dan
missed you at lunch
what she up to what
who up to
how many she do we have on
the court
oh that well it just
that a question came up
or more accurately a suggestion was made
yeah
well what it amounts to is uh
should uh
should attendance be obligatory
at these obscenity screenings
who wasnt there besides me
oh house was packed
what your beef
well the lady wonders
whether a justice who hasnt seen
any part of the film
hasnt in effect
she wants me to disqualify myself
because i wont go down there
and sit through that pile of
crap uh well
so it crap what if it is crap
that not the point
crap got the right to be crap
drop the legal language dan
are you as chief justice
suggesting that i disqualify
myself from voting on maloney
no im merely suggesting that
uh
it been suggested
where are you going
i
not roses
and have a look
at us v albertson 954
it in volume 348 us maybe 349

oh yes sir

robinson madam justice mr justice snow would like to see you

happy to see him in a minute
shell be happy to see you
in a moment mr justice
thank you
ask mr justice snow to come in
mr robinson
you may go in mr justice
thank you
no no please please dont get
up dont get up
youd stand mr justice if i came
to call on you in chambers
oh
i cant tell you how grateful i am
to you for seeing me like this
on no notice whatsoever
it my honor
is it
well i suppose it is
say
that quite a desk
and so neat
do aircraft land here frequently
what is it that you wanted
to see me about
nothing earthshaking
by george i was a little startled
to see
that youve got a male law clerk
out there
mr robinson
he not my law clerk
he my secretary
well well well well
what a generous gesture
letting men into a field
previously dominated by the other
sex
im glad youre
in favor of men lib
say let relax
do you feel like relaxing
madam justice
i hope you arent finding our
national capital too dull
after the grandeur of disneyland
you dont think much
of california do you
i try not to think of it at all
why dont you try climbing
some our mountains
oh i have i have i admire your
mountains
it your valleys that make me
nervous
now madam justice
i would like your opinion on a
point of law
concerning that great american art
form the motion picture
help yourself
oh thank you
now i was wondering if by any
chance
youd seen a film called um
the naked nymphomaniac
that the one
now you probably didnt even notice
i wasnt there
i noticed
oh you did mmm
well
well
i wonder if you found anything
uh unpleasant in the picture
first of all
i see no reason to overturn the
lower court
anyone whod seen that film would
realize that the naked nymphomaniac
is a total offense
against the public sensibility
it sickening
degrading disgusting
my my my my my my
as bad as all that
now i
wonder
if you can put your finger
on exactly what it was that
offended you
was it the title
some particular word in the title
naked is that it
what if they called it
the fully-clothed nymphomaniac
or maybe it was the other word that
bothered you
nym-pho-maniac
supposing they called it the naked methodist
or naked daughter of the american revolution
are you finished
madam justice i am a long way
from being finished
but ill pause briefly in case
there something youd like to say
thank you
let me ask you
something
would you call a female governor
a governess
is a woman composer
a composeress
no and her sex is entirely
beside the point
and a justice
of the supreme court
is a justice
not madam justess
now mr justice i submit that we
are failing in our duty on this court
if we dont try to stop the
avalanche of prurient slop
madam if youll im not
finished
which is about
to bury us
are we doing our job
if we permit anything
what are we permitting
violence in the streets
kids on drugs
filth pornography
who slaps the labels on you me
somebody better
no thank you maam
i think it unconstitutional to
set myself up as a censor
refusing to look at something is
censorship
hell i dont look at television
that doesnt make it illegal
that not the point
seeing that film is material to
making a judgment
if youd spent 0 minutes in that
screening room five minutes
you would see how obscene how
outrageous
censorship
is an outrage
what about a training film for
terrorists
a free lecture how to make a nuclear bomb in your basement
do you condone inciting to
violence
no
maam
what about inciting to decadence
define
decay
that what were here for
not me
wed better try
the people of this country have only one
absolute protection against chaos
the law
and you and i were appointed to
this court for only one reason
to uphold and sustain that law
watch out you cant turn the law
into a straitjacket
the law gotta be a suit
of clothes a man can wear
it gotta fit easy
be comfortable
law shouldnt strap a man in at the
throat or the brain or the crotch
that vivid
do you know what youre doing
youre making maloney more
important than the law
he is more important
than the law
this court doesnt try men we
put their trials on trial
that it were constantly
examining the witness who isnt there
all we ever get to see are lawyers
cold records cold briefs
where the human being
where the pain  weve gotta touch flesh
i
it in the people who get hurt
the innocent little kid who sits in
the dark theater while maloney filth
pours over him
that where the pain is
youre on the right track
youre beginning
to look at people
and when you let a little more
humanity into your thinking
you might make a damn good
justice
but i wont bet on it
youre just being sweet to me
because im a woman
do i have any appointments this
afternoon
35 miller securi
cancel it
mrs stowe just called
call her back tell her i cant
talk to her
and blow your nose please
i dont wanna talk to anybody i
gotta work i gotta concentrate
yes sir
he says he doesnt want to
i wouldnt dream
of disturbing justice snow
i
film producer oh
there you are mr maloney
what
a respected colleague of mine
mr justice snow feels that this
court
is doing you a great injustice
by not meeting you face-to-face
we ought to hear your voice
bask in your personality
what was the expression he used
oh yes we should touch flesh
mason call the guard
dont go mason
this might be quite
educational for all of us
would you care to take the
witness stand
mr maloney
going to swear me in
going to lie to me
maybe you better swear me in
i
to be the truth the whole truth
and nothing but the truth so help me
loomis
let get right
to the point mr maloney
are you aware
that you broke a law
no maam
you didnt realize
that the state of nebraska
has statutes
prohibiting pornography
doesnt the first amendment apply
to guys like me
isnt it an umbrella that
supposed to keep all of us from
getting wet
or is there a hole in it over
nebraska
but the people of nebraska
have the freedom
to protect themselves
against your abuse of their freedom
that what this case
is all about
look lady im a businessman
and i dont see where the
government got any business
telling me how to run my business
oh im relieved
for a while i thought you
might be thinking of yourself as an artist
i do recall the word art
plastered across your film
tell me mr maloney
do you honestly believe
the naked nymphomaniac is art
sure why not who to say it
isnt what art anyway
artists dont even know let
alone lawyers
exactly what was
your motivation
in filming the naked nymphomaniac
money
you cant have much pursuit of
happiness in this country
unless you pursue a little money
anything unconstitutional about
that
does the constitution give you the right to
do anything for money
does it give you the right to
shove me into bankruptcy
the lawmakers of nebraska want to stop the
pollution
of the minds and morals of the
public
by films like yours
my colleague on this bench mr
justice snow
fine man
know him very well
he feels very strongly about
profit-pursuing
conglomerates which pollute the
air
air is different youve got to
breathe
you dont have to go to the
movies
state and local governments have a right
to set community standards
people can say i dont want this
kind of thing in my neighborhood
is it okay for people to say
we dont want any baptists in our
neighborhood damn it
your film it called
an exploitation film is that correct
right and youre keeping me from
exploiting it
arent you exploiting women
the act of love
giving a distorted picture of sex
to young people
who am i hurting
im not talking
about bodily harm
has anyone died from seeing
the naked nymphomaniac
what about injury
to the spirit
doesnt your
celluloid poison
attack all human dignity
and decency and beauty
i dont think you like my picture
i think somebody had better set
some standards
some voice had better say
this far and no farther
youre talking like a woman not
a justice
youre talking like a justice not
a witness sit down maloney
have you been
to new york lately
times square
44th 45th street
it used to be a decent place to
visit
unforgettable music powerful
plays
today right around the corner on
8th avenue
your picture
probably playing
alongside a lot of other
pornography and filth
watch out lady
scratch me put me out of
business and who else gets scratched
the same end of the eraser can wipe out
your unforgettable music and your
powerful plays
youre sharp maloney
you pull every sleeve
inside out
you want the liberty
to dirty up my liberty
my security against
the profiteering
two-legged cockroaches of this world
my right to live in a sweet
and decent society and not some kind of sewer
even in new york you have
to clean up after your dog shits on the sidewalk
and it a perversion
of the constitution
to shove our faces
into excrement
masquerading as art
im glad i met you
mr maloney
i feel i have a much better
understanding of you
and justice snow
he may want the absolute freedom
to go straight to hell
that his right
but he has no right to force the
rest of the country to take the trip with him
you may step down
yeah you make a pretty good
trial lawyer
too bad you had to gave it up
you make a very good actor
i may always have the feeling
there a pornographic producer
under your robes
it makes me sick to my stomach
to have to defend a principle as
noble as the first amendment
on the basis of that can of film
you found so offensive
but by god as long as i have
tongue and tonsils
and the ability to talk ill
defend everybody right to speak
and every man right to be wrong
i yield to you as the authority on
that mr justice
she dangerous
that woman is positively
dangerous
the men on this court have got to
stick together mason
after all there are only eight
of us left
against all of her
should we smile a little
good god no
who would trust a happy justice
should the lady be standing while the five
of us are sitting
this is where the newest member of
the court is supposed to be i think
ready everybody
now please dont look
directly into the camera
and i think if you seem to be
looking out into space
into the future
i cant see that far
i didnt bring my glasses
youll need more than glasses
my wife always hates these
pictures she says we all look stuffed
why dont we take a snapshot of
our convictions
it would have to be a moving
picture if convictions mean anything
my convictions dont move
neither did
the dinosaurs
come on tear that one up
yes mr chief justice
would somebody suggest to our
great dissenter
that he curb his celebrated sense
of humor
hell need all his wits to keep on
writing
minority opinions
well a man got to decide
whether to be on the right side or the winning side
once in a while
they are the same
this court isnt going to reverse
the seventh circuit on omnitech
dan we sure as hell wont
if we dont even hear it
come on gentlemen
hold that for the conference room
you can wreck the whole business
establishment
mr justice snow
with your damn socialist ideas
im about as much of a
socialist as donald duck and you know it
you brainwashed
brahman
come on come on harold sit
down
come on now dan
behave yourself
here we go
destroy that negative
yes sir
harold try to remember
what you did with your
face last year
you looked pretty good
i did
just look trustworthy
somebody in washington
better look that way
is justice snow implying
that nobody in this city or this
country is honest except him
oh to hell with the picture
cj dan where are you going
weve got to finish this
paste me in from last year
cj all right richard well try
again tomorrow
richard yes sir
it been a pleasure
good afternoon sir
where are you going not to
europe again
much farther than that
virginia
yes you can take those two
ill bring these myself
i thought id be gone
before you came home
usually that
not very difficult
i left a note for you on
the dining room table
i dont want to read any notes
then you can talk it
over with my lawyers
they thought that would
avoid any unnecessary unpleasantness
what so pleasant about talking
to lawyers
what the hell is happening around
here
maybe the court can stand your bad
temper but i cant
what do you mean
bad temper
goddamn it im the sweetest-
tempered son of a bitch in the district of columbia
sit down
why
should
i sit down
what the hell are you doing
describe the wallpaper what
wallpaper
in this room
wallpaper
what color is it
what design who memorizes
wallpaper
you cant memorize
what you dont ever see
good-bye dan
pink roses and butterflies for
christ sake
ruth how does the great dissenter
feel about our playing tennis
together every week
im not sure
i havent told him yet
well i must say dan snow has
done a lot for my game
every time i get a high one i can
really kill
that not you on the
other side of the net
that
why they go by me so fast
go change
ill give you a lift to
mount olympus
how do you stand his moods mason
every time i see him he ready
to explode
does he ever just relax
yeah he does have
strong feelings
same as you do
i hope youre
not implying that he and i are alike
no no no
i just mean that you
have similar differences
you both care about things
nothing unimportant
whether youre making
a point on the bench
or on the tennis court
does justice snow ever talk about
me
oh all the time
anything quotable
well
i withdraw the question
hearsay evidence
inadmissible
morning
youre not a double agent are
you mason
no sir
we just get in a set of
tennis about once a week before breakfast
she plays very well for a justice
of the supreme court
she got a hell of a
backhand sir
yeah i know ive seen it work
when we found out we
were both tennis players
well i hope you dont mind sir
hell no
go ahead
wear her out
yes sir
why are you trying
to persuade me
you know i wont vote to hear it
all right all right
well table this one
why not table everything
dan oh no abbot vs omnitech
i think putting omnitechon the
calendar
is an exercise in futility
right
oh is it
perhaps if we stopped
recruiting judges
from the jungles of orange county
maybe we can get a 4-5 court turned
into a 5-4 court
i
that what were trying to save
you from dan
well i dont want to be
saved i want to keep right
on going straight to hell
what omnitech done
that what these little stockholders
are trying to find out
but dan the momentum
engine doesnt work
that
what omnitech says
what about these experts who say
otherwise
but well never know will we
because donald richards chairman
of omnitech
has bought up all the patents and
buried them
this action is against omnitech
not donald richards
donald richards is omnitech for
christ sake
where the hell is he and why has
he disappeared
immaterial
i dont see any new constitutional
grounds
for us to review omnitech
if we dont hear it who in the
hell will
this is the last goddamn stop
lady
why does brother snow
insist on wasting the court valuable time
because i smell plenty of
unrefrigerated fish here
muckraking
that all it is dan
do you
like being screwed
because that what donald
richards is doing you know
screwing you and me and
the whole country
youre a troublemaker you know
that
yes i know that
but somebody has to be cj
move up omnitech
good morning
mr justice snow
morning
what makes you think
it going to rain
the newspaper said there an 80%
chance of rain or snow
what do they know
theyre wrong
80% of the time
that was our floor
yes why didnt you get out
i thought youd go first
how would you like to take
a little trip with me
that what we seem to be doing
ever been to the smithsonian
not lately
understand i wouldnt dream
of trying to change your mind for the world
but there something at the
smithsonian i think you ought to look at
some early american pornography
good
morning mr justice
good morning morning
what have you got in the
briefcase harold
dirty books
what i want you to see
at the smithsonian
isnt even vaguely offensive to
the public sensibility
what time
make it 35
well take my car
what time does the smithsonian
close
this wont take long
why dont we
take my car
it has a top
well i guess the paper was
right about the rain
first time theyve been
right in 20 years
lady what you are about to see
is a revolution
nonviolent i hope
this is it
spin it go ahead
go ahead give it a spin
it wont hurt you
that is a momentum engine
it a model of course
a prototype
imagine a flywheel
20 times heavier
revolving 000 times faster in a
sealed vacuum
this could revolutionize
the entire auto industry
we could have cars without gas
tanks because they wouldnt need gas to run
this is what omnitech bought and
buried
if you want to change my vote on omnitechno thank you
i
dont treat me like
a first-year law student
im just trying to
youre trying to change my
mind
i
that machine is a dandy idea and
it just doesnt work
it never been given a chance to
work
it been squashed
would you go to all this trouble
if i were a man
one of the brothers
sex has nothing to do with it
because im a woman your resplendent
male ego wants to win me over
jefferson said an educated electorate
is the basis
youre an arrogant self-centered
male chauvinist pig
youre just being sweet to me
because im a man
i only wanted you to see
with your own eyes
that gasoline isnt the only way
to store energy
well dont expect me to believe
that alice in wonderland whirligig
could run a car
having trouble are you
excuse me
finally
got the auto club
may be a while
we could take a cab
if we could get a cab
have you eaten anything
no i just got in here
same as you
i meant today
oh today well i um
im not sure
i dont keep track
do you know what that does to your blood sugar
what do you care
a person cant make valid judgments
with low blood sugar
is that any place in the constitution
well good evening
i
i think you are hungry and you just
dont know it
im not hungry
and i know it
ill order something for you
youre not telling her
to put poison in my food are you
i dont know how to say poison
i appreciate
your concern about my insides
dome a favor will you put your
hand over your eyes
why
a test
what on the wall
wallpaper
uh what color
gold any pattern
yes what is it
cherry blossoms with bluebirds
how the hell
did you know that
i saw it when we came in
you go around looking
at wallpaper everyplace
my god that what
wrong with you
your brains are
full of wallpaper
well your brain is full of
watch that
watch
people
people here
i was going to say momentum engines
and omnitech
omnitech may be the most importance case
of this decade
when one tiny group of
stockholders tries to
undermine a
great corporation
big huge
not necessarily great
how come the president
of omnitech didnt show up at his own trial
don richards doesnt want the
courts to put him out of business
rule against omnitech and down
goes the whole corporate system
only the abuses
in your isolated opinion
not so isolated
we have statutes that define the abuses
if we try to extend our
jurisdiction all im asking is what fair
into legislative area
dont you see omnitech must win
oh you think that do you
yes
well it seems to me anything can
happen no matter how great the odds
that what makes
this country so wonderful
i absolutely agree with you
but do you know what i believe more
than anything else you said it on the bench
you said the noblest purpose of
this high court
is to keep the government off
the backs of the people
people yes
not the large
arent corporations people
owned by people run by
people not the large
not the large
for the benefit of people
not the large
and they may be destroyed by people
on the high court who seem to have
forgotten some of their earlier
and wiser opinions
ah the hell with this
you havent eaten your dim sum
to hell with my dim sum
what about your blood sugar
to hell with my blood sugar all i
wanted anyhow was a cup of coffee and a fork
is something wrong sir
yes everything
give me a check
ill take the check
yes you do that youll feel much
better about it
and dont worry about me
ill be just fine ill take a cab
good
it nothing personal
he just very upset
he been working too hard
i dont have any
money for a cab
good night madam justice
would you see that these
are delivered to justice snow in the morning
justice snow still here
i dont think so
he in the court maam
this late
yes maam
okay thank you
how long have you been here
since october
im not sure the lady has enough
seniority
to haunt these chambers at uh
20 in the morning
what the hell are you doing here
so late
studying for finals
what about you
well i used to think i lived in
georgetown
but i guess this is more my
permanent residence
i brought you these
a few opinions of mine from the lower court
i
youre welcome
may i ask you a question
sure
other than my blood sugar
and my bad table manners
exactly how repulsive do you
think i am
do you want my opinion as a
justice of the supreme court
no no no
as a woman
you want to take the fifth
maybe one of us
had better
my car runs now
would you like a lift home
no
pretty cool around the snow
household these days
i heard that
im sorry
it your fault you know
my fault
i think my wife thinks that i spend
so much time being furious at you that i dont
have enough energy left to be
furious with her
and i have a hunch
she thinks i consider you attractive
there certainly
no evidence to support that contention
oh i wouldnt be too sure about
that
i hope you assured mrs snow that
the mere fact one of your
colleagues happens
to be a woman
that no mere fact
that an overwhelming fact
but ive never been prejudiced by
sex
entertained yes prejudiced
never
yes yes yes
this is a dandy i remember it well
i dont agree with a word of
it but it well-written
how can you be so goddamned
logical
and so goddamned wrong
what so wrong about encouraging
the economy
i
about improving the quality of
life on this planet
and i
agree with you dan
justice snow
dan is fine
look what these great companies
have done for us
large companies
large
large
are we going to throw those
benefits away
should i take my weekly wash down
to the banks of the potomac river and
and beat it with rocks
wont get it very clean
if we reverse the
seventh circuit on omnitech
if it so damn important
why doesnt donald richards
stand trial
what do you want to know
youre not donald richards
and he the one
with the answers
swear me in
oh you want to play that game
again
all right youre sworn
i am delighted mr donald
richards
to have you here at last
in the flesh so to speak
would you state your occupation
please
im president and chairman of the board of
omnitech international
why did you refuse to testify in
the suit against your company
i never received a subpoena
they have to know where you are
to serve it
but you deliberately made yourself
unavailable remained in hiding
doesnt an american citizen
have a right to privacy
tell me something sir
i
im the majority stockholder
yes i kind of thought you were
nowwhat about all those little
stockholders
who got wind of the appalling
notion
that you mr  richards grabbed up an
earthshaking idea and strangled it
you know what
i find appalling
that you have the
arrogance to pass
judgment on something you dont
know anything about
but you do mr richards
when we test something
like the momentum engine
and we find out it doesnt work
we drop it and spend
our time and money on something that will work
what about the experts who say it
does work
you think i would
deliberately dump an idea
that could make millions for my
stockholders
but youve got billions committed
to the internal combustion engine
omnitech makes spark plugs you
wanna go on making spark plugs
there money in carburetors you
wanna go on making carburetors
youve got vested interests in 6
oil companies
you wanna go on selling gas
you have one noble purpose mr
richards to keep things the way they are
an idea doesnt just turn
into a reality
some thing gotta
make it happen
it takes money
to build factories
grind out a product
advertise it sell it
did you ever hear
of a box of cereal
or a tube of toothpaste
going out and giving birth to itself
do you know what it takes
capital capital youre
damn right
and im not going to
commit my corporation
to the expenditure of millions of
dollars on an idea
that just doesnt work
that you say doesnt work
look
thomas edison dreamed up the
electric light bulb
the government gave him a patent
so that he could profit from his
invention
fine but the light itself belongs
to everybody
and nobody nobody has a right
to turn on the darkness
you dare accuse me
my company my companies of practices
that belong in the dark ages
then let there be light
come out of the dark donald
richards
who are you
what do you look like where have
you been
holy christ
you know what i think i think
youre dead donald richards
i think youve been dead for a long
time eight maybe 0 years
it been that long since anyone has
seen you
and if you are dead who is
running omnitech
who actually holds all that power
some cabal of faceless men
without names without
fingerprints
without social security numbers
who are compounding your
suppression of the momentum engine
by hiding behind a dead man
why would anybody
want to do that
hell of a lot of reasons dodge
inheritance taxes
avoid a power struggle
hang on to government contracts
omnitech is a phantom government
hiding behind a dead man
we cant see it we didnt elect
it
it doesnt exist it never dies
why dont we hoist up a new flag
the star-spangled omnitech
omnitech rules the waves
omnitech uber alles
ugh
ugh
oh
dan are you all right
yeah sure
it was a lot of fun
i enjoyed it
attendant one
two
up

sick before

unconstitutional

my husband knew
jack knew that donald richards
died in costa rica in 973
and he was part of the
conspiracy to cover it up
did you know

anything about it
no of course not
then there no reason to resign

but goddamned wrong
what do you think i should do dan
what protocol

you dont write anybody keep
your robes on
let the mud fly it wont stick
to you
quitting the court without good reason
is spitting in the face of the
government that put you there
without good reason
ive got good reason
because of something your husband did
that you know nothing about
when youre married
to somebody you become
youre a member of the high
court
you dont dissociate yourself from
somebody that youre married to
by god something happens
in a moment in the twinkling of
an eye

stanley left some instructions that involve dan
and ive gotta find him
he surprised the hell out of me in brussels
he sent me a postcard
the only part i can make out is dear christine
at least i think that dear you know what his handwriting is like
then there something here about climbing a mountain

thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies
thou anointest my head with oil
my cup runneth over
surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
all the days of my life
and i will dwell in the house of the lord for ever
i dont really know
when stanley left instructions that he wanted me to uh
what do you call it say a few words
i was surprised
mr justice morehead and i disagreed on a lot of things in our lifetimes
and i guess it only natural that we keep right on disagreeing
i know seven other men who could do this better
but im not about to file a dissenting opinion
stanley morehead was a gentleman of honest mind
you cant say that about many men in this city
in this century
stanley and i were like a pair of flying buttresses
leaning against opposite sides of a gothic cathedral
we helped keep the roof from caving in
if wed both been on the same side all the time
we might have pushed the building over
you dont have to agree with a man in order to respect him
stanley and i had one argument over and over again
i never won i never could win
he used to ask me
what in god name is the practical use of mountain climbing
one time i said to him
well on a mountaintop maybe youre a little bit closer to god
he laughed and said dan what the hell do you know about god
i do know this
mr justice stanley morehead is not in any box
about to be covered by earth
he at the top of a mountain higher than i have ever climbed
fire
ready aim
fire
ready

band playing america the beautiful
christine i think we should have hired a limousine like the others
dan nonsense the fresh air will do you good
alice looked awful you know what burns me
toda y s starbrushed off stanley whole life with two inches
and printed two full pages of smart-ass
speculation about his replacement
dan ill bet it a surprise somebody nobody thought of
christine she doesnt have many close friends
d a n it always a surprise especially for the guy who gets capped
christine maybe ill plan a small
dinner party for her after we get settled
dan when the president gave me the nod i was so surprised
i couldnt talk for a week
christine i dont think i could stand
one of those terrible teas with all those wives
could be anybody
a lot of good men around
a lot of lousy ones too
if i were alice id go to europe
the warm part
how was europe
wet
how was your mountain
high
you have any idea who going to be appointed
to what
the court
i never try to second-guess a president
man moves into the white house
you have no idea what happens to his mind
i just hope he has an active membership card in the human race
brass band playing
wa l do hi ted
always feels like the first day of school doesnt it
hope i never graduate
i dont know what wed do without you dan
morning radabaugh anything happens
everything that happened is on your desk mr justice snow
still got the same cold
sinus
dan who there
mason woods sir
may i come in sir
of course you can come in what the hell do you think youre here for
thank you sir
and you dont have to knock
it highly unlikely youll ever catch me on the couch with ms radabaugh
yes sir
ive only got one complaint about you
youre too goddamn polite
stop being scared of me mason you got the job
yes sir
uh would you care for some tea mr justice or a scotch
maybe id better have both
no i dont wanna overdo it forget the tea
um now this supports your position
on abbot vs omnitech
forget omnitech
but that at the top of the order list
it gonna get struck
why
because my brave brethren on the court
are too chicken-hearted to hear it that why
when im getting ripped off mason
i want to know who doing the ripping
how much can these multinational monsters get away with
i dont know and neither do you
because they keep hiding behind all those tv commercials
saying how goddamn holy they are
even the cj is scared to hear omnitech
he says it like telling god
you want to examine the books
peace up to a point
i tell you mason
the most dangerous thing in the world is to be cautious
people are always falling down the ones
who are afraid theyll trip over something
take a chance and it is sir
and dont always agree with me
if you think im wrong and dont say so
then what the hell good are ya
i like law clerks who argue with me yes sir
no sir
i mean ill try to do that sir
not to do that sir what this
this is collins vs california
it a kinky one that came up from the ninth circuit
the berkeley student who wore a t-shirt that said
fuck the white house
did he have his pants off
it doesnt say
well then i dont see any clear and present danger
that he intended to implement the opinion of his t-shirt
well the ninth circuit held it was offensive to the public sensibility
just being offensive is not an offense
one man pornography may be another man poetry yes sir
yes yes yes yes yes yes
lady purity speaking from the cloisters of california
free speech is not ipso facto filthy speech
dirt is a splendid environment for earthworms
but it is a grave for the human mind
i wish to hell she didnt write so goddamn well
you see mason that what this court is for
t o restrain the ruth loomises of the world
sir i found this opinion on surveillance
but you wont have to read it
wont he
you wrote it
well read it to me
i might have forgotten it or changed my mind
when god created the world
he did it alone in private all by himself
no monitors no hidden microphones
he made it the way he wanted it
but what if someone had invaded god privacy
would he have put the world together the same way
i doubt it he wouldve made it a popular world
both and the garden of eden would have turned out
like las vegas or 42nd street
telephone ringing
would you like to take any calls sir
uh ms radabaugh will get that
phone ringing
no she wont
chambers of mr justice snow
oh
yes mrs snow
it your wife but she doesnt want to bother you
you re not bothering me youre interrupting me

phone clicking
hello hello

she left early
sinus
she looked terrible
radabaugh been with me for 23 years
and she always looks terrible
how do you do that sir do what
well you reach in there and find exactly what youre looking for
in the middle of all that all that m ess
to you it a mess to me it a wilderness of free association
dont ever straighten up my desk mason
id never be able to find anything
always been suspicious of neatness
if there nothing on top of a man desk
he probably shoved all the clutter into the drawers
and if his drawers are empty what the hell does he need a desk for
may i come in dan sure cj
how are you mr chief justice
uh im not sure
mind if i lie down on your couch
mason see if those t-shirts are available on the open market
id like to wear one under my robe
what t-shirts
none of your goddamn business
do i ask you about your underwear
how come your couches are much more comfortable than mine
you know something cj
maybe ill give you that couch
as a going-away present
who going away
think of how many people would bust a gut with joy if i retired
nah you wouldnt do that to me dan
oh i wont quit when youre short-handed
ill wait until youve got nine men on the bench again
yeah hmm
who the president going to pick
he already been appointed

mr justice snow im gonna have to ask you to rephrase that question
a woman
he picked a woman
great
good for him itll be fun
who is it who is she who who
the president has just sent up to the senate judiciary committee
the name of judge ruth hagador loomis
of the ninth circuit court of appeals
get off my couch i have to lie down
now now dan
youre joking it a joke it a joke isnt it
the president i am told thinks he has made
a great progressive step in the history of mankind
ruth loomis the mother superior of orange county
what goes through a man head when
he makes an appointment like that
guess he was trying to be evenhanded
president of all the people
the senatell never go for it will they will they
forget it
phone ringing
continued ringing
where ms radabaugh
continued ringing
chambers of mr justice snow
it a reporter any comment for the washington post
no comment from mr justice snow at this time
youre better than ms radabaugh
the president wants a woman on the court
why not pick ms radabaugh
shed be perfect shed never show up
jeff why in god name do i get a sinking feeling in my gut every time
i think about that woman sitting on this court
it not because she a woman
i like women my wife a woman
the bench will smell better with a little perfume on it
but ruth loomis
phone ringing
how can you just let it ring
telephone has no constitutional right to be answered
don t pay any attention to it itll go away
see
i hear she plays tennis
hitler played the harmonica
oh she may not be so bad
she young
we could use some young blood around here
and she isnt stupid
fix yourself a drink
i just might do that
knocking
here she is now come in
is it true
jack anderson on the phone
would either of you care to say anything to him
yes ask him where im spending my vacation next summer
i dont know but he probably does
ill just tell him neither of you is available for comment
how does a newspaperman like jack anderson
find out what happens in the oval office so fast
simple he got a friend in the soviet embassy
and im 0 minutes late
only one thing dan before you consider resigning
resigning who the hell gonna resign
you think id leave you here alone and get sprayed down
by the lysol lady of orange county
and if that holy junta at the white house
picked her to replace stanley morehead
who in god name do you suppose theyd send up to take my seat
shirley temple
5-2
bill change sides ill let you take the sun for a while
not bad for a beginner am i
when are you gonna let me take you some place where i can win
don t you think a year is long enough to be a practicing widow
seven months dont rush me
am i on the list
youre at the top
public announcer judge loomis telephone
long distance call for judge loomis
sorry bill
senator im sorry these proceedings are taking so much time
but were breaking ground here
and i trust the committee questions
arent embarrassing you judge loomis
i dont embarrass easily senator
audience laughing
judge loomis
judge loomis about your interests and equities
would they influence your decisions on the high court
the financial statement in front of you is complete senator
when i was appointed to the ninth circuit
i disposed of anything that might possibly raise
a question of conflict of interest
thank you
but you were still married to a very active
and successful corporation lawyer
was i expected to dispose of him
audience laughing
according to this fbi report
you and your husband were partners
in the law firm of loomis and loomis
excuse me senator why do you keep bringing up my husband
when i was appointed to the federal bench
he took over the entire practice
it was a tremendous burden on him
it probably what killed him
did you ever represent omnitech international or its chairman
donald richards
no senator
youre quite sure about that
ruth quite sure
senator after you left is it possible that the firm represented him
id have no knowledge of that
and since your husband death
youve had no contact with any member of that firm
ruth none oh that not quite true
i do play tennis once in a while with bill russell
w illiam russell
h e joined the firm after i went to the bench
senator do you ever discuss legal business with him
no senator
do you think perhaps
youre a little too young judge loomis
to take these responsibilities on yourself
as i recall
mr justice snow was a year younger than i am
when he was appointed to the court
audience laughing
clapping
do you feel your decisions on the high court
might be influenced by the fact that
well youre a woman
i hope so
uh arent a man decisions influenced by the fact that he a man
for two centuries this court has expressed men opinions
and perhaps it time for the majority of the population
to have one voice in nine in the rulings of the supreme court
senator is the lady implying
that male justice is perverted
ruth havent we outgrown those fears about the periodic instability
of the female of the species
eggs are not the seeds of insanity
a woman can ovulate and think at the same time
laughing and clapping
senator were striving to be objective
yes but really what does sex have to do
with being a judge
somebody with the capacity to bear children
is gifted not crippled
a uterus is like absolute pitch
some people have it some dont
well according to this fact sheet
judge loomis has never had any children
yes but does the constitution say that a
supreme court justice has to be a mother
laughing faintly
judge loomis we dont mean to probe into your personal life
why not my entire life is public
the fbi is wrong in reporting to you that i have no children
i have hundreds
we are the parents of our ideas
and uh so my children
in other words my opinions my decisions
are the result of conception
and the delivery is sometimes painful
you may not like my children
you may find them ugly
but by god your ideas and mine
have equal rights to live together
to grow to change even to die
if there are no further questions
the committee will consider an executive session
where well recommend to the full body of the senate
thank you judge loomis
thank you mr chairman
thank you gentlemen
now let check it just once more
mr justice carey is now on this end
that correct then mr justice webb
webb mr justice quincy
that him mr justice snow
that right the cj stays in the center of course
then mr justice halperin o kay
mr justice clewes
that him mr justice thompson
that right and the new chair for justice loomis
on this end that correct
does a lady need this
well tell her it a wastebasket
good afternoon
welcome to washington justice loomis
thank you everything ready
great oh is the phone in
ah yes the man left an hour ago
phone ringing
hello
ready for your coronation
bill and it is
how did you get this number i dont even know it
well i do if it ever slips your mind just give me a ring
in the bedroom please
in the bedroom
im talking to the bellman you idiot
it sweet of you to call
i just wanted to be the first man in recorded history
to ask a supreme court justice for a date
so noted the clerk will put it on the docket
thatll take two years
not now that im in charge
mr agronsky
whenever youre ready
tape is rolling
this is an historic day for the nation
and for the supreme court of the united states
the court has been in session
since the first monday in october
which according to the judiciary act of 789
marks the start of a new term each year
no camera has ever photographed
the traditional robing ceremony
in the sanctum sanctorum of the court
and none is there today
since the death of justice stanley morehead
this has been an eight-man court
which as justice daniel snow has pointed out
resembles a four-man basketball team
today the vacancy has been filled
but this still remains an eight-man court
well where is she
may be we ought to sound the warning buzzer a little sooner
i suppose she has things to do that we dont
after all i dont have anything to do with my hair
agronsky this is an historic occasion
like the jesuits going coed
suppose shell wanna hang chintz curtains everywhere
i hate chintz
why am i nervous she the one who should be nervous
now gentlemen things are not going to be any different
from the way theyve been every two
minutes to 0 in the history of the court
now weve got to think of her exactly as one of the brothers
good morning
justice loomis welcome
w elcome to the court thank you
good morning good morning maam
thank you for the lovely roses
uh
you dont send me roses anymore cj
it 958 gentlemen and madam justice
we shake hands like this every day
every morning just before we take the bench
like nine boxers coming in to a ring
we shake hands before we knock each other out
clock chiming
gavel knocking
the honorable the chief justice and associate justices
of the supreme court of the united states
oh yep whoz thatz
all persons having business
before the honorable the supreme court of the united states
are admonished to draw near and give their attention
for the court is now sitting
god save the united states and this honorable court
cj today orders o f the court
have been certified by the chief justice filed with the clerk
and will not be announced orally
probably the peak of every lawyer career
is that moment when he is presented and accredited to plead
before the highest court in the land
only lawyers ever plead in that hallowed chamber
but today all eyes are focused on the court newest newcomer
who has just received confirmation from the senate of the united states
court watchers will be fascinated in the weeks and months ahead
by the figure in the leather chair farthest to the left
of the chief justice
how will this feminine presence
affect what for two centuries
has been an all-male preserve
because so many states
have accepted pornography as a way of life
does not mean that we are willing
to compromise our values
in the sovereign state of nebraska
ergo i beseech this distinguished body
in its infinite and scholarly wisdom
to uphold exalted standards of morality
which this lofty court so fervently advocates
and how rare it is to find judicial minds
so attuned to the higher reaches of the spirit
so understanding of the basic values
we so dearly cherish
so incredibly sensitive to the deep strains of decency
which constitute the lapping tidewaters
of our heritage
the state of nebraska
contends that herbert g maloney
knowing and willfully
perpetrated an obscene and foul
your time is up
may i be permitted c j no
any questions gentlemen
madam justice
i get the impression that the state of nebraska
would like to see this film confiscated burned
and the ashes sent into space is that the idea
if the court so recommended
is it your contention that the constitution
gives this court any such power
this court is the judge of its own power
until we actually examine the film in question i think that
may it please the court
i respectfully submit that my client rights under the first amendment
thee first amendment doesnt give anybody the right
to commit acts which are harmful to the public good
but this is an educational film
a major documentary a work of art
how can we judge that until weve seen it
do any of the justices object
besides justice snow
i think it essential that we see the film
all right then the clerk will schedule a showing of the film
at some future date which is not in conflict
with the schedule already on the calendar
upbeat music playing
loud moaning
intensified moaning
narrator if you saw lois walking along
in the sunshine of beverly hills
you might think she was just a healthy ordinary girl
but lois has a problem
like the alcoholic who cannot stop with one drink
like the compulsive eater
who must consume one dessert after another
lois can never be satisfied
can never get enough of what she craves
music playing
why isnt mr justice snow here
he never comes to these showings
narrator the average young woman wants one man
but lois is insatiable
actors moaning
have we missed much
the lady just getting started
you guys get over there
and shut the door
loud music playing
narrator we asked a distinguished physician
to give his opinion of lois condition
h e has asked that his name be withheld
because of his high standing in the medical profession
dr x from the point of view of a man of science
what can be done for lois
this sort of affliction is difficult to treat
let look at the other sex as lois sees them
oh let not
narrator can lois ever be cured
or is she doomed to a life
of ever-increasing frustration
i dont know about lois but im cured
havent we seen enough
narrator during the next hour
well try to show you
no i dont think so
projectionist stop the film please
please
thank you does anyone object
no not me
mr chief justice are you stopping the film
because there a woman in the room
no no that not why im uncomfortable
you think im offended of course im offended
but that no reason to stop the film is it
cj just a moment please
madam justice loomis as a man
i am somewhat embarrassed that you
have to sit here and watch this thing
i certainly can understand how harold feels
i wouldnt want to sit through it with my wife
or arrange a special showing for mother day
but your wife and your mother havent been appointed to this court
time is the point gentlemen and madam justice
and we have a responsibility not to waste it
i have seen enough to make my decision
judges me too yes
i do apologize justice loomis
why
something is very wrong here
youre all so polite to me
im not being too outspoken am i
no no
no we want you to speak up speak right out
raise hell if you want to
you may be sorry you said that snickers
actually i do have one question oh
how can mr justice snow pass judgment on something
without even seeing it
hasnt he virtually disqualified himself on maloney
would you like to suggest that to justice snow
i dont think that one of my privileges isnt it yours
well yes i suppose it is
and mr chief justice id like to examine the rest of the film
if you dont mind
just to see if there a shred of redeeming social or artistic value
project ionist would you continue the film please
thank you
loud music playing
530 will be fine
howdy ben

well do this later ben
yes sir
hi dan missed you at lunch
what she up to what who up to
how many she do we have on the court
oh that well it just that a question came up
or more accurately a suggestion was made y eah
well what it amounts to is uh
should uh
should attendance be obligatory
at these obscenity screenings
who wasnt there besides me
oh house was packed
what your beef
well the lady wonders
whether a justice who hasnt seen any part of the film
hasnt in effect
she wants me to disqualify myself
because i wont go down there
and sit through that pile of crap uh well
so it crap what if it is crap that not the point
crap got the right to be crap
drop the legal language dan
are you as chief justice
suggesting that i disqualify myself from voting on maloney
no im merely suggesting that uh
it been suggested
where are you going
ive got a present for madam justice
not roses
and have a look at us v albertson 954
it in volume 348 us maybe 349
is she in
oh yes sir mr justice snow
intercom buzzing
uh just hold on a second yes
robinson madam justice mr justice snow would like to see you
he would when
he here
just check those references ill get back to you thank you
tell mr justice snow ill be happy to see him in a minute
shell be happy to see you in a moment mr justice
thank you
ask mr justice snow to come in mr robinson
you may go in mr justice
thank you
no no please please dont get up dont get up
you d stand mr justice if i came to call on you in chambers
oh i wouldnt be too sure about that chuckles
i cant tell you how grateful i am to you for seeing me like this
on no notice whatsoever
it my honor is it
well i suppose it is
say
that quite a desk
and so neat
do aircraft land here frequently
what is it that you wanted to see me about
nothing earthshaking
by george i was a little startled to see
that youve got a male law clerk out there
mr robinson he not my law clerk he my secretary
well well well well
what a generous gesture
letting men into a field
previously dominated by the other sex
im glad youre in favor of men lib
say let relax
do you feel like relaxing
madam justice
i hope you arent finding our national capital too dull
after the grandeur of disneyland
you dont think much of california do you
i try not to think of it at all
why dont you try climbing some our mountains
oh i have i have i admire your mountains
it  your valleys that make me nervous
now madam justice
i would like your opinion on a point of law
concerning that great american art form the motion picture
help yourself
oh thank you
now i was wondering if by any chance
youd seen a film called um
the naked nymphomaniac
that the one
now you probably didnt even notice i wasnt there
i noticed
oh you did mmm
well
well
i wonder if you found anything
uh unpleasant in the picture
first of all
i see no reason to overturn the lower court
anyone whod seen that film would
realize that the naked nymphomaniac
is a total offense against the public sensibility
it sickening degrading disgusting
my my my my my my
as bad as all that
now i wonder if you can put your finger
on exactly what it was that offended you
was it the title some particular word in the title
naked is that it
what if they called it
the fully-clothed nymphomaniac
or maybe it was the other word that bothered you
nym-pho-maniac
supposing they called it the naked methodist
or naked daughter of the american revolution
are you finished
madam justice i am a long way from being finished
but i ll pause briefly in case there something youd like to say
thank you
let me ask you something
would you call a female governor a governess
is a woman composer a composeress
no and her sex is entirely beside the point
and a justice of the supreme court
is a justice not madam justess
now mr justice i submit that we are failing in our duty on this court
if we dont try to stop the avalanche of prurient slop
madam if youll im not finished
which is about to bury us
are we doing our job if we permit anything
what are we permitting
violence in the streets
kids on drugs
filth pornography
who slaps the labels on you me
somebody better no thank you maam
i think it unconstitutional to set myself up as a censor
refusing to look at something is censorship
hell i dont look at television that doesnt make it illegal
that not the point
seeing that film is material to making a judgment
if you d spent 0 minutes in that screening room five minutes
you would see how obscene how outrageous
censorship is an outrage
what about a training film for terrorists
a free lecture how to make a nuclear bomb in your basement
do you condone inciting to violence
no maam
what about inciting to decadence
define decay
that what were here for
not me
wed better try
the people of this country have only
one absolute protection against chaos
the law
and you and i were appointed to this court for only one reason
to uphold and sustain that law
watch out you cant turn the law into a straitjacket
the law gotta be a suit of clothes a man can wear
it gotta fit easy be comfortable
law shouldnt strap a man in at the throat or the brain or the crotch
that vivid
do you know what youre doing
youre making maloney more important than the law
he is more important than the law
this court doesnt try men we put their trials on trial
that it were constantly examining the witness who isnt there
all we ever get to see are lawyers cold records cold briefs
where the human being where the pain weve gotta touch flesh
ill tell you where the pain is
it  in the people who get hurt
the innocent little kid who sits in the dark theater while maloney filth
pours over him
that where the pain is
youre on the right track
youre beginning to look at people
and when you let a little more humanity into your thinking
you might make a damn good justice
but i wont bet on it
youre just being sweet to me because im a woman
do i have any appointments this afternoon
35 miller securi
cancel it
mrs stowe just called
call her back tell her i cant talk to her
and blow your nose please
i dont wanna talk to anybody i gotta work i gotta concentrate
yes sir
he says he doesnt want to
i wouldnt dream of disturbing justice snow
im looking for herbert g maloney
film producer oh
there you are mr maloney
what
a respected colleague of mine
mr justice snow feels that this court
is doing you a great injustice
by not meeting you face-to-face
we ought to hear your voice
bask in your personality
what was the expression he used
oh yes we should touch flesh
mason call the guard
dont go mason
this might be quite educational for all of us
would you care to take the witness stand
mr maloney
going to swear me in
going to lie to me
maybe you better swear me in
i herbert g
maloney do solemnly swear the testimony i am about to give
to be the truth the whole truth
and nothing but the truth so help me loomis
let get right to the point mr maloney
are you aware that you broke a law
no maam
you didnt realize that the state of nebraska
has statutes prohibiting pornography
doesnt the first amendment apply to guys like me
isnt it an umbrella that supposed to keep all of us from getting wet
or is there a hole in it over nebraska
but the people of nebraska have the freedom
to protect themselves against your abuse of their freedom
that what this case is all about
look lady im a businessman
a n d i dont see where the government got any business
telling me how to run my business
oh im relieved
for a while i thought you might be thinking of yourself as an artist
i do recall the word art
plastered across your film
tell me mr maloney
do you honestly believe
the naked nymphomaniac is art
sure why not who to say it isnt what art anyway
artists dont even know let alone lawyers
exactly what was your motivation
in filming the naked nymphomaniac
money
you cant have much pursuit of happiness in this country
unless you pursue a little money
anything unconstitutional about that
does the constitution give you the right to do anything for money
does it give you the right to shove me into bankruptcy
the lawmakers of nebraska want to stop the pollution
of the minds and morals of the public
by films like yours
my colleague on this bench mr justice snow
fine man know him very well
he feels very strongly about profit-pursuing
conglomerates which pollute the air
air is different youve got to breathe
you dont have to go to the movies
state and local governments have a right to set community standards
people can say i dont want this kind of thing in my neighborhood
is it okay for people to say
we dont want any baptists in our neighborhood damn it
your film it called an exploitation film is that correct
right and youre keeping me from exploiting it
arent you exploiting women
the act of love
giving a distorted picture of sex to young people
who am i hurting
im not talking about bodily harm
has anyone died from seeing the naked nymphomaniac
what about injury to the spirit
doesnt your celluloid poison
attack all human dignity and decency and beauty
i dont think you like my picture
i think somebody had better set some standards
some voice had better say this far and no farther
youre talking like a woman not a justice
you re talking like a justice not a witness sit down maloney
have you been to new york lately
times square 44th 45th street
it used to be a decent place to visit
unforgettable music powerful plays
today right around the corner on 8th avenue
your picture probably playing
alongside a lot of other pornography and filth
watch out lady
scratch me put me out of business and who else gets scratched
the same end of the eraser can wipe out
your unforgettable music and your powerful plays
youre sharp maloney
you pull every sleeve inside out
you want the liberty to dirty up my liberty
my security against
the profiteering two-legged cockroaches of this world
my right to live in a sweet and decent
society and not some kind of sewer
even in new york you have to clean up
after your dog shits on the sidewalk
and it a perversion of the constitution
to shove our faces into excrement
masquerading as art
im glad i met you mr maloney
i feel i have a much better understanding of you
and justice snow
he may want the absolute freedom to go straight to hell
that his right
but he has no right to force the rest of
the country to take the trip with him
you may step down
yeah you make a pretty good trial lawyer
too bad you had to gave it up
you make a very good actor
i may always have the feeling there a
pornographic producer under your robes
it makes me sick to my stomach
to h ave to defend a principle as noble as the first amendment
on the basis of that can of film you found so offensive
but by god as long as i have tongue and tonsils
and the ability to talk ill defend everybody right to speak
and every man right to be wrong
i yield to you as the authority on that mr justice
she dangerous
that woman is positively dangerous
the men on this court have got to stick together mason
after all there are only eight of us left
against all of her
should we smile a little
good god no who would trust a happy justice
should the lady be standing while the five of us are sitting
this is where the newest member of the court is supposed to be i think
ready everybody
now please dont look directly into the camera
and i think if you seem to be looking out into space
into the future
i cant see that far i didnt bring my glasses
youll need more than glasses
my wife always hates these pictures she says we all look stuffed
why dont we take a snapshot of our convictions
it would have to be a moving picture if convictions mean anything
my convictions dont move
neither did the dinosaurs
come on tear that one up
yes mr chief justice
would somebody suggest to our great dissenter
that he curb his celebrated sense of humor
he ll need all his wits to keep on
writing minority opinions
well a man got to decide whether to
be on the right side or the winning side
once in a while they are the same
this court isnt going to reverse the seventh circuit on omnitech
dan we sure as hell wont if we dont even hear it
come on gentlemen hold that for the conference room
you can wreck the whole business establishment
mr justice snow
with your damn socialist ideas
im about as much of a socialist as donald duck and you know it
you brainwashed brahman
come on come on harold sit down
come on now dan behave yourself
here we go
destroy that negative
yes sir
harold try to remember what you did with your face last year
you looked pretty good
i did
just look trustworthy
somebody in washington better look that way
is justice snow implying
that no body in this city or this country is honest except him
oh to hell with the picture
cj dan where are you going weve got to finish this
paste me in from last year
cj all right richard well try again tomorrow
richard yes sir
it been a pleasure
good afternoon sir
where are you going not to europe again
much farther than that
the virgin
yes you can take those two ill bring these myself
i thought id be gone before you came home
usually that not very difficult
i left a note for you on the dining room table
i dont want to read any notes
then you can talk it over with my lawyers
they thought that would avoid any unnecessary unpleasantness
what so pleasant about talking to lawyers
what the hell is happening around here
maybe the court can stand your bad temper but i cant
what do you mean bad temper
god damn it
im the sweetesttempered son of a bitch in the district of columbia
sit down
why should i sit down
what the hell are you doing
describe the wallpaper what wallpaper
in this room
wallpaper
what color is it
what design who memorizes wallpaper
you cant memorize what you dont ever see
good-bye dan
door slamming shut
pink roses and butterflies for christ sake
ruth how does the great dissenter
feel about our playing tennis together every week
im not sure i havent told him yet
well i must say dan snow has done a lot for my game
every time i get a high one i can really kill
that not you on the other side of the net
that why they go by me so fast laughs
go change ill give you a lift to mount olympus
how do you stand his moods mason
every time i see him he ready to explode
does he ever just relax
yeah he does have strong feelings
same as you do
i hope youre not implying that he and i are alike
no no no i just mean that you have similar differences
you both care about things
nothing unimportant
whether youre making a point on the bench
or on the tennis court
does justice snow ever talk about me
oh all the time
anything quotable
well
both laughing
i withdraw the question
hearsay evidence
inadmissible
morning
youre not a double agent are you mason
no sir
we just get in a set of tennis about once a week before breakfast
she plays very well for a justice of the supreme court
she got a hell of a backhand sir
yeah i know ive seen it work
when we found out we were both tennis players
well i hope you dont mind sir
hell no
go ahead
wear her out
yes sir
door slamming shut
justices chattering why are you trying to persuade me
you know i wont vote to hear it
all right all right
well table this one
why not table everything
dan oh no abbot vs omnitech
all groaning
i think putting omnitechon the calendar
is an exercise in futility
right oh is it
perhaps if we stopped recruiting judges
from the jungles of orange county
maybe we can get a 4-5 court turned into a 5-4 court
im so sick and tired of being on the short end of the vote all the time
that what were trying to save you from dan
well i dont want to be saved
i want to keep right on going straight to hell
what omnitechdone
that what these little stockholders are trying to find out
but dan the momentum engine doesnt work
that what omnitech says
what about these experts who say otherwise
but well never know will we
because donald richards chairman of omnitech
has bought up all the patents and buried them
this action is against omnitech not donald richards
donald richards is omnitech for christ sake
where the hell is he and why has he disappeared
immaterial
i dont see any new constitutional grounds
for us to review omnitech
if we dont hear it who in the hell will
this is the last goddamn stop lady
why does brother snow insist on wasting the court valuable time
because i smell plenty of unrefrigerated fish here
muckraking that all it is dan
do you like being screwed
because that what donald richards is doing you know
screwing you and me and the whole country
you re a troublemaker you know that
yes i know that but somebody has to be cj
move up omnitech
good morning mr justice snow
morning
what makes you think it going to rain
the newspaper said there an 80 % chance of rain or snow
what do they know
theyre wrong 80 % of the time
that was our floor
yes why didnt you get out
i thought youd go first
how would you like to take a little trip with me
that what we seem to be doing
ever been to the smithsonian
not lately
understand i wouldnt dream of trying to change your mind for the world
but there something at the smithsonian i think you ought to look at
some early american pornography
good morning mr justice
good morning morning
what have you got in the briefcase harold
dirty books
what i want you to see at the smithsonian
isnt even vaguely offensive to the public sensibility
what time
make it 35
well take my car
what time does the smithsonian close
this wont take long
why dont we take my car
it has a top
well i guess the paper was right about the rain
first time theyve been right in 20 years
l ady what you are about to see is a revolution
nonviolent i hope
this is it
spin it go ahead
go ahead give it a spin it wont hurt you
that is a momentum engine
it a model of course a prototype
imagine a flywheel 20 times heavier
revolving 000 times faster in a sealed vacuum
this could revolutionize the entire auto industry
w e could have cars without gas tanks
because they wouldnt need gas to run
this is what omnitech bought and buried
if you want to change my vote on omnitech no thank you
im trying to change dead words on a page
into a visual image to clarify in your mind
dont treat me like a first-year law student
im just trying to youre trying to change my mind
im trying to help you change your mind all by yourself
that machine is a dandy idea and it just doesnt work
it never been given a chance to work
it been squashed
would you go to all this trouble if i were a man
one of the brothers
sex has nothing to do with it
becaus e im a woman
your resplendent male ego wants to win me over
jefferson said an educated electorate is the basis
youre an arrogant self-centered male chauvinist pig
youre just being sweet to me because im a man
i only wanted you to see with your own eyes
that gasoline isnt the only way to store energy
engine wheezing
w e ll dont expect me to believe
that alice in wonderland whirligig could run a car
engine wheezing
having trouble are you
excuse me
finally got the auto club
may be a while
we could take a cab if we could get a cab
have you eaten anything
no i just got in here same as you
i meant today
oh today well i um
im not sure i dont keep track
do you know what that do es to your blood sugar what do you care
a person cant make valid judgments with low blood sugar
is that any place in the constitution
well good evening
im not hungry just bring me a cup of coffee
i think you are hungry and you just dont know it
im not hungry and i know it
ill order something for you
speaking cantonese
youre not telling her to put poison in my food are you
i dont know how to say poison
continues in cantonese
i appreciate your concern about my insides
do me a favor will you put your hand over your eyes
why
a test
what on the wall wallpaper
uh what color
gold any pattern
yes what is it
cherry blossoms with bluebirds
how the hell did you know that
i saw it when we came in
you go around looking at wallpaper everyplace
my god that what wrong with you
your brains are full of wallpaper
w e ll your brain is full of
watch that watch
people people here
i was going to say momentum engines and omnitech
omnitechmay be the most importance case of this decade
when one tiny group of stockholders tries to
undermine a great corporation
big huge not necessarily great
how come the president of omnitech didnt show up at his own trial
don richards doesnt want the courts to put him out of business
rule against omnitech and down goes the whole corporate system
only the abuses
in your isolated opinion
not so isolated w e have statutes that define the abuses
if we try to extend our jurisdiction all im asking is what fair
into legislative area
dont you see omnitech must win
oh you think that do you y es
well it seems to me anything can happen no matter how great the odds
that what makes this country so wonderful
i absolutely agree with you
but do you know what i believe more than anything else
you said it on the bench
you said the noblest purpose of this high court
is to keep the government off the backs of the people
people yes not the large
arent corporations people
owned by people run by people not the large
not the large for the benefit of people
not the large
and they may be destroyed by people
on the high court who seem to have
forgotten some of their earlier and wiser opinions
ah the hell with this
you havent eaten your dim sum
to hell with my dim sum
what about your blood sugar
to hell with my blood sugar
all i wanted anyhow was a cup of coffee and a fork
is something wrong sir yes everything
give me a check
i ll take the check
yes you do that youll feel much better about it
and dont worry about me ill be just fine ill take a cab
good
it nothing personal
he just very upset
he been working too hard
i dont have any money for a cab
good night madam justice
would you see that these are delivered to justice snow in the morning
justice snow still here
i dont think so
he  in the court maam
this late
and it is maam
okay thank you
how long have you been here
since october
im not sure the lady has enough seniority
to haunt these chambers at uh
20 in the morning
what the hell are you doing here so late
studying for finals
what about you
well i used to think i lived in georgetown
but i guess this is more my permanent residence
i brought you these a few opinions of mine from the lower court
ill read them thank you
youre welcome
may i ask you a question
sure
other than my blood sugar
and my bad table manners
exactly how repulsive do you think i am
do you want my opinion as a justice of the supreme court
no no no
as a woman
you want to take the fifth
maybe one of us had better
my car runs now
would you like a lift home
no
pretty cool around the snow household these days
i heard that
im sorry
it your fault you know
my fault
i think my wife thinks that i spend so
much time being furious at you that i dont
have enough energy left to be furious with her
and i have a hunch
she thinks i consider you attractive
there certainly no evidence to support that contention
oh i wouldnt be too sure about that
i hope you assured mrs snow that the mere fact one of your
colleagues happens to be a woman
that no mere fact
that an overwhelming fact
but ive never been prejudiced by sex
entertained yes prejudiced never
yes yes yes
this is a dandy i remember it well
i dont agree with a word of it but it well-written
how can you be so goddamned logical
and so goddamned wrong
what so wrong about encouraging the economy
ive heard you talk over and over again
about improving the quality of life on this planet
and i agree with you dan
justice snow
dan is fine
look what these great companies have done for us
large companies
large large
are we going to throw those benefits away
should i take my weekly wash down
to the banks of the potomac river and
and beat it with rocks
wont get it very clean
if we reverse the seventh circuit on omnitech
if it so damn important
why doesnt donald richards stand trial
what do you want to know
youre not donald richards
and he the one with the answers
swear me in
oh you want to play that game again
all right youre sworn
i am delighted mr donald richards
to have you here at last
in the flesh so to speak
would you state your occupation please
im president and chairman of the board of omnitech international
why did you refuse to testify in the suit against your company
i never received a subpoena
they have to know where you are to serve it
but you deliberately made yourself unavailable remained in hiding
doesnt an american citizen
have a right to privacy
tell me something sir
ill bet you have a share or two of stock in omnitech
im the majority stockholder
yes i kind of thought you were
now what about all those little stockholders
who got wind of the appalling notion
that you mr richards grabbed up an earthshaking idea and strangled it
you know what i find appalling
that you have the arrogance to pass
judgment on something you dont know anything about
bu t you do mr richards
when we test something like the momentum engine
and we find out it doesnt work
we drop it and spend our time and money on something that will work
what about the experts who say it does work
you think i would deliberately dump an idea
that could make millions for my stockholders
but youve got billions committed
to the internal combustion engine
omnitech makes spark plugs you wanna go on making spark plugs
there money in carburetors you wanna go on making carburetors
youve got vested interests in 6 oil companies
you wanna go on selling gas
you have one noble purpose mr
richards to keep things the way they are
an idea doesnt just turn into a reality
something gotta make it happen
it takes money to build factories
grind out a product advertise it sell it
did you ever hear of a box of cereal
or a tube of toothpaste going out and giving birth to itself
do you know what it takes
capital capital youre damn right
and im not going to commit my corporation
to the expenditure of millions of dollars on an idea
that just doesnt work
that you say doesnt work
look
thomas edison dreamed up the electric light bulb
the government gave him a patent
so that he could profit from his invention
fine but the light itself belongs to everybody
and nobody nobody has a right
to turn on the darkness
you dare accuse me my company my companies of practices
that belong in the dark ages
then let there be light
come out of the dark donald richards
who are you
what do you look like where have you been
holy christ
you know what i think i think youre dead donald richards
i think youve been dead for a long time 8 maybe 0 years
it  been that long since anyone has seen you
and if you are dead who is running omnitech
who actually holds all that power
some cabal of faceless men
without names without fingerprints
without social security numbers
who are compounding your suppression of the momentum engine
by hiding behind a dead man
why would anybody want to do that
hell of a lot of reasons dodge inheritance taxes
avoid a power struggle
hang on to government contracts
omnitech is a phantom government hiding behind a dead man
we cant see it we didnt elect it
it doesnt exist it never dies
why dont we hoist up a new flag
the star-spangled omnitech
omnitech rules the waves
omnitech about everything
voice echoing
ugh
ugh

you dont want to know
give me the key
dont tell me you havent got it
you knew about this all along didnt you
so did your husband
reverend loomis preached the sermon
i just said amen

and our law firm were involved with omnitech

doorbell ringing

what the hell are you doing here
official business of the federal government
may i come in
oh did i get you in the middle of something
im sorry
what did you do just get up and walk out
yes maam this is very nice
they told me youre still under observation
it bigger than my place they dont even know what happened to you
well theyll have to figure it out without me
i cant give them any more of my time
dan if it was a coronary
coronary
my heart wouldnt dare attack me
now what all this crap about quitting
do you mind
why dont you lie down
that okay ill be all right in a minute put your feet up
can i get you a pillow
sure why not
are you asleep
yes
here
you want to tell me what wrong
are you well enough to talk
im even well enough to listen
the other night
you made an outrageous statement
you said you didnt think donald richards was still alive
i got this out of a sealed loomis and loomis file in santa ana
it donald richards death certificate
holy god
anybody else see this
no
this makes omnitecha whole new ballgame
god are we going to shake up the brothers
get your clothes on
w e can still make that morning conference
im not going
what
i told you
im resigning from the court
that idiotic it doesnt make any sense
my husband knew
jack knew that donald richards died in costa rica in 973
and he was part of the conspiracy to cover it up
did you know
did your husband ever tell you anything about it
no of course not
then there no reason to resign
get some clothes on let get down there
if there the slightest doubt in anybody mind that i belong there
i dont want to be there
lady that is extremely noble
but goddamned wrong
what do you think i should do dan what protocol
should i write the president
you dont write anybody keep your robes on
let the mud fly it wont stick to you
quitting the court without good reason
is spitting in the face of the government that put you there
without good reason ive got good reason
because of something your husband did that you know nothing about
when youre married to somebody you become
youre a member of the high court
you dont dissociate yourself from somebody that youre married to
by god something happens
in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
this corrupt ion shall put on incorruption
st paul vs the corinthians
etal
interesting case
but what if an incorrupt person finds out that she corrupt
that applesauce and you know it
i thought youd be happy to have me off the court
that was before you were on the court
i never thought id ever kiss a supreme court justice
you didnt kiss me i kissed you
make you a deal
you dont resign i dont die
let me think about that
dont we want the working entrance
not this morning right up the front steps
cant wait to get into that conference room
you really think we can go in there and i can pick up where i left off
hell no every day is different
youre different im different

boatswain
aye sir
man the guns cram on more sail
man the guns
larboard helm
larboard helm
uncover the guns
run out the guns
put a shot across their bow
number one gun
fire
fire again
number two gun
fire
you may show them our true colors
mr mannering
break out the jolly roger
will we never hear the end
of this captain blood
this pirate who captures our treasure
and our ships
you my dear marquis de riconete
you why havent you
hanged the scoundrel
your majesty the hanging of one
pirate is hardly the answer to our problem
as long as these outlaws are protected
in the west indies by the english
oh the english the english the
be careful you fool
you see marquis it isnt enough that
the ruler of spain be bled by his physician
these buccaneers must bleed
our kingdom too
my lord marquis
youre the governor of la hacha
our most important island possession
in the west indies
you have a galleon of 40 guns
therefore we charge you
with the personal responsibility
of capturing this captain blood
i shall do everything in my power sire
but of course your majesty realizes
this is no common criminal
you send me after
blood is a learned intelligent man
a doctor
a doctor are the english so healthy
that their physicians must turn to piracy
for a living
blood is not english your majesty
he irish
i have prepared a dossier on the man
which i should be pleased to read
read read
peter blood born in ireland 658
bachelor of medicine
dublin university 680
arrested by the english
for saving the life of a wounded rebel
during the monmouth rebellion
rebellion yes yes count harrach
sentenced to death
sentence later changed
to a life of slavery at barbados
there he and a group of fellow slaves
managed a somewhat incredible escape
that enough count harrach
well we offer a reward
of 50000 pieces of eight
for the head of this buccaneer
even an englishman may find that tempting
if not im sure you my lord marquis will
unless this captain blood is captured
your wealth and position will be forfeit
oh but sire you mustnt
captain alvarado
sire
you will accompany the marquis
to the indies
and will assume the post
of military position
that is i mean of military attaché
yes your majesty
and you will act as our representative
and we will charge you
with the direct responsibility
of seeing that our orders are carried out
no sign yet peter
no the beach seems deserted
what time do you make it tom
not an hour left before dawn
well have to work fast
faith yes
therell be the devil to pay
if the marquis finds us
lying off his island in broad daylight
you still think the signal will come
of course
pacheco is a man of his word
besides we cant leave
we must get supplies and ammunition
there very little left
we can get what we need in tortuga
no it too far
besides ive a taste for shooting at
the spaniards with their own cannon balls
peter over there
one two
three
lower away
aye aye sir
lively now
you stay here scotty
aye
where is pacheco
captain blood captain blood
captain
captain
what is it man
it was a trap captain
we were ambushed
pacheco wasnt there
all the other men were taken prisoner
if it fighting they want
well give them a taste of it
but weve little enough powder and ball left
as it is
no matter our men are there
but the marquis ship within sound
of our guns
it suicide
for us and those men ashore too
sure youre right tom
let try to get to tortuga for supplies
aye
you men take scotty below
weigh anchor make sail
look lively now
your excellency
so my new slaves
are captain blood men eh
ive been anxious to meet your captain
for a long time
where was he headed for
well
where was your captain bound for
where
where
perhaps youll be more talkative
after a short while in the pearl fisheries
take them away
well excellency
didnt i make you a good price
for such interesting slaves
señor fairfax your greediness
for the sale of a few slaves
has cost me a chance to capture
your countryman captain blood
but your excellency i didnt know
it was the avenger in time to warn you
by now blood is 20 leagues away
in a fast ship
-impossible to capture
you will have other chances
not like this one
platt
hokenby
peter why dont we go ashore
im staying aboard
but peter there nothing we can do
to help those men now
why must you keep thinking about it
what would you have me do then
try and forget them
forget our own men
slaves of spain
rotting away in the marquis dungeons
do you remember what it was like
before we escaped from slavery
the stench of those filthy holes the swill
the chains rotting away
the flesh from your bones
the whips and the branding irons
yes i remember
dont ask me to forget then
captain blood
captain blood
scotty if youre in trouble
-with the father of another señorita
it not me that in trouble this time
it the marquis
what are you talking about
a french ship just arrived from la hacha
her mate tells me that
that hurricane that been blowing about
hit the marquis ship
and just about ruined her
the santa paula
aye
she no fit to go to sea again
until she been repaired
hear that tom
we could sail right to the island
and the marquis couldnt give us a chase
but he still got a fort
and 50 cannon mounted on the beach
there no cannon in the cove
at the back of the island
all the men aboard
aye sir
but peter you cant take the avenger
right into the marquis grasp
wed surely be caught
youre right tom
we wouldnt stand a chance weigh anchor
this is the most foolhardy thing
youve ever done
beyond a doubt stand by to make sail
well end up slaves ourselves
hell probably hang all of us
set our course for la hacha mr mannering
aye aye sir
hands aloft
take out the topsail
im still dead set against it peter
it too dangerous
this cove right
on the marquis back doorstep
where would he be less likely
to look for us
and what if somebody recognizes you
what if pacheco see you
he betrayed us once already
pacheco wont betray anybody else
ill make sure of that while im here
well how do you propose
to get into the town
you cant just walk in and have yourself
announced to the marquis
ill leave that to lady chance
she obliged me more than once
perhaps shell oblige me again
ive great faith in the lady
youll need it
whoa señores fruit fresh fruit

before i go to la hacha
no no move on move on
wait
where did you say you were going
to la hacha across the island

about you señorita
señorita
pepita
pepita
pepita maria rosados
pepita maria rosados
the woman is even more lovely
than the name
miguel knew i would be helpless
before such beauty
that why he kept you a secret from me
the señor is very kind
but it is true that miguel is very fond of me
oh pepita fond of you
it is only because im his closest friend
that he is so helpless that
helpless
si completely
it is only because of that
that he trusts me alone in the city with you
but i am only human
and you must help me to resist
dont worry about that señor
i will help you
but remember im only human too
pepita
si señor
i was seeking early today an old friend
of mine but his shop was deserted
perhaps you know him
i know all the men in la hacha
what is your friend name
pacheco fernando pacheco
oh yes yes i remember him
he is the thin one
but he left the island yesterday
left
oh no im sure youre mistaken
im certain he is still here
i was told he had gone to portobelo
oh who told you this
the overseer carmilio
but señor why worry about old friends
when it is so easy to find new ones
in la hacha
what is that
oh just the slaves
theyre on their way back
from the marquis pearl fisheries
the ones that are left
the ones that are left
there are fewer every day
last week 34 yesterday 32
today who knows
what happens to them
what happens to anyone who has to dive
for pearls in water filled with sharks
oh please excuse me
i forgot the overseer wine
papá
papá wake up papá
the señor overseer is here
must i run this inn all by myself
get moving
halt
sit down
my beautiful pepita
have you no welcome for your friend today
pablo is bringing it
pablo
pablo
now i feel better my beautiful pepita
dont touch
dont touch
women women theyre all the same
if the señor would care
for a little more wine
i should be most happy
to buy it for him huh
another time i must take
those slaves back to the dungeons
this is the day for the marquis inspection
get moving on your feet
come on get moving
señor
pepita i must go
this is for the wine huh
oh no señor not from a friend of miguel

si i know
get along get along hurry up
come on
why dont you wait in the carriage
lsabelita ill only be a few moments
please dont be too long uncle
the sun is very hot
i should be most happy to escort
the señorita back to the residencia
you dont seem too anxious
to inspect the dungeons captain
well i hardly find them attractive
excellency
im afraid the captain still judges us
by spanish standards lsabelita
he forgets we are in a new world
where men live by new laws
or die by them
come now captain
these slaves dive for pearls
and pearls are one of the few things
that make this dull little colony bearable
your excellency
everything is ready for the inspection
splendid splendid and the day catch
three pearls excellency
two of fine quality
uncle
dont you think i deserve some reward
for waiting in this heat
of course my dear
a small pearl like this for a marquis niece
it fit only for a
for a peddler
excuse me my dear
how clumsy of you peddler
forgive my hands señorita
they are not accustomed to pearls
perhaps you would appreciate them more
if you were to dive for one yourself
perhaps
darling
i thought id never get away
from your uncle
dont tell me business bores you
by contrast yes
look im over half finished
how do you like it
it very charming my sweet
oh george
why dont you take me away from here
back to spain to the court
and the life i was meant for
you know i will lsabelita as soon as i can
im sick to death of my life here
sewing and embroidering
supervising the kitchen maids
waiting on my uncle
and those dull dull official parties
ah sf señora second assistant clerk

you should see the dungeons
deep underground
seems very interesting
i should like to see them
without a pass with the marquis seal
not even the king of spain
could come though that door
without the seal of the marquis
not even the king of spain huh
if it bad like you say
heaven knows why he should want to
carmilio huh well it almost midnight

his name was fernando pacheco
but
but pacheco is dead huh
i know
you might say he bequeathed it to me
it was in his hand when i found him
i dont know this pacheco
i made a mistake about this medallion
it looks like something else
does it
thanks for your hospitality
juan
juan
si señor
find señor fairfax bring him here hurry
si señor
but a man like you
a man like you does not come to la hacha
only to sell fruit
why you dont tell pepita your real reason
for being here
i have told you
lies lies nothing but lies
if you were really a fruit peddler
people would not be
asking questions about you
about me
who has been asking about me pepita
you dont answer my questions señor
why should i answer yours
well you are my friend little one
you must trust me have faith
let go señor or ill awaken papá
please señor stop it señor
papá
oh papá
oh señor
oh señor
stop it
it is too late to stop señorita
from the first moment we met
it was too late
you are lying to me again i know
does this seem like a lie señorita
lie to me some more señor
first you must tell me
who was asking questions
it was only the overseer
but let us not talk about him now let us
what did the overseer want pepita
just to know who you are
and what you are doing in la hacha
was that all
si
now i have told you my secrets
you must tell me yours
of course but not tonight it is too late
if you do not trust me señor
oh i trust you pepita
but as i told you before
i do not trust myself
pedro youre not going to go
si
but i thought
adiós little one
have you lost something señores
no señor we have found what we lost
that is good
whoever your master is
he could have taught you to be
a little more polite
nothing like a long nap
after a strenuous exercise
but it was quite unnecessary
for your associates
to go to so much trouble to bring me here
after all i am just as anxious to make
your acquaintance as you are to make mine
señor señor
my name is george fairfax
in my line of work one cant be too careful
and what exactly is
your line of work señor
what are you doing in la hacha
señor morales
i sell fruit
persimmons mangoes pomegranates
and is that all you have for sale
everything
im afraid we cant do business after all
then if the señor will excuse me i will
sit down morales
you are a stranger in la hacha my friend
and perhaps youre not aware
that the laws here are very strict
for instance
the penalty for robbery is death
for example suppose you were
to have stolen something of mine
a ring say or a timepiece or a medallion
and were you to be caught with it
in your possession
i could have you hanged
it a very harsh law
but sometimes a useful one
and what is the penalty for murder
in la hacha
well that depends on whether or not
the murderer is caught
for example there was a regrettable death
of a local shopkeeper
a ship chandler just yesterday
poor fellow he became too talkative
and yet there have been
almost no questions about his death
and i do not think there will be any
incidentally if i should
shoot a robber in my quarters
and he happened to be armed
thered be even less trouble
with the authorities
but how would i be expected to know
that he was holding an unloaded pistol
this one however is loaded
who is it
it me lsabelita let me in
lsabelita what are you doing here
george we must leave
la hacha now tonight
we cant
the santa paula is ready to sail
she wasnt as badly damaged
as they thought
and the marquis
doesnt trust his niece alone in the city
tomorrow morning
im being sent to a convent
im sorry lsabelita
but i dont see how we can possibly
but we must we must
look these will buy us a boat
and whatever else we need
please george please
all right all right well leave
the guards followed you here
señor fairfax our orders are to return
the señorita to the residencia
and to place you under arrest
and my sword
si señor
very well
come and take it
ill be all right
george
it not too bad
sit down sit down
there are three more guards
coming up the stairs
now go and go fast
he badly hurt
we must get out of here
before those four guards are replaced by 40
i know a place near the quay
where well be safe
you are very lucky señor
if the lead had hit you six inches
nearer to your right
youd have been lying
in a different kind of bed
as it is youll be well enough
to fight another duel tomorrow
open up
ope up i say
open in the name of the marquis
it the guard
i know that
ive got to let them in or theyll break in
im aware of that too señor bragg
ope up i say
just a minute just a minute im coming
all right
open i say
im coming
what may i do for you gentlemen
me tavern closed for the night
we do not want your rotten liquor
innkeeper
were hunting for the marquis niece
and two men who attacked our guards
the marquis niece in billy bragg place
that a rich one
were searching everywhere
the marquis orders
please
upstairs go
gentlemen please walk quietly
customers are asleep
oh no no lieutenant not in there please
stand to one side innkeeper
what do you mean
bursting into my private room
waking up my husband
get out get out you filthy pig
get out you pigpig
any more rooms
youd like to see lieutenant
oh no no no no
no fine ladies at billy bragg you know
this being a soldier is a risky business
aint it
si you speak the truth come along men
come along
buenas noches
same to you sir
all clear mr fairfax
señor bragg the world lost an honest actor
when you turned rogue
youre a man of many talents
that i am sir
this is a night for genius señor morales
an innkeeper turned actor
and a fruit peddler
who is both doctor and fencing master
you seem to forget señor fairfax
that you owe me your life
a debt i may later wish to collect
at your service
george
señor morales were deeply grateful to you
both of us
yes how can we ever repay you
well l
what did you do with my jewels
i do with them i never had them
i must have left them on the quay
i remember now
i put them down when you were wounded
it doesnt matter
doesnt matter
you spill jewels worth 30000 doubloons
in the dirt and say it doesnt matter
yes george youre right
my jewels do matter
they matter a great deal
you see querido
i wanted to go to spain with you
but without my jewels
wed be paupers wouldnt we
and that would be frightful wouldnt it
-lsabelita stop it i didnt mean
i know exactly what you meant
but lsabelita
you should rest señor
perhaps you would like a glass of wine
no no
pardon me if i get one for myself
bragg stay with the señor
perhaps he might need something
aye aye sir
is this by any chance
what you were missing señorita
i found it on the quay
gracias señor
now everything is all right huh
you and señor fairfax can elope
you deliberately hid my jewels
you wanted me to quarrel with george
of course i did
why
are you in love with him
i i dont know im not sure
i suppose i thought hed take me away
from this horrible place
it unfortunate you picked the wrong man
i couldve told you that
you
what would a fruit peddler know about
or are you a peddler señor
you no longer talk like one who are you
at the moment
i find it convenient to be a peddler
my uncle would have ways
of discovering your true identity
i dont doubt it for a minute
but if he were to take up my time
how could i be of service to you
service
yes
ive had business dealings with mr fairfax
and i began to suspect his true nature
so i left my ship in the cove
on the other side of the island
and came here in disguise to
to shall we say investigate
and what has all this got to do with me
well youre anxious to leave la hacha
and i have a boat so
you could take me away from the island
to maracaibo
or port of spain
why not
oh señor
how can i ever thank you enough
well you might try
throwing me another pearl
i suppose i do deserve that
youll not let this one slip
through your fingers
have no fear
i didnt know you then
or id have been more careful
youre gallant whoever you are
in my fashion
now ill send you back to the residencia
as it is if we were to set foot
on the waterfront
the guards would send you back
to the marquis
and me to the pearl fisheries
you must go back to your uncle at once
what can i say to him
hell send me to the convent
not if you were to tell him that
youve discovered mr fairfax true colors
and beg him to forgive you
and pardon the poor fruit peddler
yes yes of course
ill come to the residencia tomorrow
for the pardon and if it safe we can go
very well i trust you
i know nothing about you
and yet i do trust you
perhaps because you have no choice
oh i dont know you are different
you save a man life or take it like that
perhaps im not so different
you said yourself
you know nothing about me
how much do i need to know
doctor swordsman
i got it
port royal tortuga
that who he is captain blood
blood
aye
billy bragg still got his two eyes
hasnt he
how come youre traveling with him
mr fairfax and dont know
a reward of 50000 pieces of eight
billy bragg
weve turned some good deals in our time
but this is the biggest one of all
get to the marquis as fast as you can
bragg i have something for you to do
you will take the señorita to the residencia
but i cant leave sir i
go along billy
go to the residencia ill be all right
youll stay here with me wont you
señor morales
you may be sure of that señor
señor bragg huh
aye
the señorita she is safe at home
aye sir
but ive got something more important
to tell you captain blood
i met you in tortuga captain
the red lion tavern
you remember billy bragg
bragg
aye i know ive put on a bit of weight
but you remember billy bragg
oh yes
billy bragg-
i finally stole enough money
to get a place of me own
well if youre charging
for these accommodations
youre still engaged in piracy
leastwise captain im too much
of a buccaneer to ever turn informer
ive not accused you of it
aye but your friend mr fairfax
put me up to it
that why he wanted me to go with the girl
so id turn you in and wed split the reward
that adds another count against him
another
yes
he murdered a man who used to supply us
and sold six of my crew into slavery
would you like me
to dispose of this fairfax captain
not yet i may have use for him
the avenger is on the far side of the island
i may be back for friend fairfax
before we sail
hell be here
now i must surrender myself to the marquis
what
oh not as peter blood
but as a fruit peddler
who served the marquis niece
and who earned her confidence
why take such a risk captain
billy if im to get my men out of prison
i must first get myself into the residencia
pedro morales
morales
excellency
so
my niece tells me
that youve proved an invaluable friend
the señorita is most generous excellency
perhaps
and yet i cant help wondering
if she might not have been returned
to the residencia
without your invaluable assistance
and without costing me the lives
of my guards
i apologize for my enthusiasm excellency
however you have been of some assistance
you are free to go
gracias excellency
and morales
in the future try to curb your enthusiasms
at another time
you may not find me so lenient
excellency
if your excellency
will seal the order
for the prisoner release
this is the wrong seal
the square one is the order for release
pardon excellency
are you a murderer as well as a thief señor
it hardly murder
i was watching you from the corridor
what did you steal from the courtroom
well i
i took a pass to help us escape
us im not as stupid as that
you were planning to leave without me
well this is hardly the place to explain
come with me and ill
im not going anywhere
and neither are you
there are guards to prevent that
señorita wait
youre right
i wasnt going to take you with me
i told you i was
so id have a chance to steal this pass
you must believe me
i only came here to help some friends
escape from la hacha
ive listened to enough of your stories
you can tell this one to my uncle
he may be more interested than i
wait please
lsabelita you want to leave this island
then think of my friends in the dungeons
compare your reasons for escape
with those of men living in slavery
you came here to help criminals escape
theyre not criminals
theyre men who were trapped
and sold into slavery by your friend fairfax
i know what it like to be an innocent man
and live as a prisoner
i was a slave once myself
and there was no reason for that
no reason except as a doctor
i treated a dying patient
for that i was sentenced to a life of slavery
i felt the whips and knew the weights
of those chains and asked no favors
youre asking one now
not for myself
you may have many reasons for hating me
i dont blame you
but you cant hate the men i want to help
did you really think
id be moved by all this
yes i did
lsabelita
why are you out here
it was stifling inside i wanted some air
youd better go to your room
you might catch a chill
yes all right ill come in
so youre going to go away
youre going to leave la hacha
perhaps i am perhaps i may never leave
that is true you may never leave
if you do not let me help you
what do you mean
carmilio the overseer
has told me he would like to kill you
carmilio huh
possibly i do need your help pepita
si perhaps i need your help very much
we will be partners huh you and i
oh no no señor i will not be a fool again
i will make you rich
no i tell you i wont
how rich
here
the rest is for you for one little favor
there is something i want you to do for me
of course
from now on we live only for each other
now your friend carmilio
oh carmilio i forgot about carmilio
pepita tonight i dont want you
to forget about him
so i wont forget about him partner
you know carmilio
what
i think you have the most beautiful hair
in all of la hacha
you do
si i do
you love me
oh sf very much carmilio
if you love me
why you always making fun of me
oh my silly little blockhead
how else would pepita fool them
if papá knew how much i loved you
he would lock me in the cellar nights
i would much rather be here with you
dont you like that carmilio
yes very much
but it against the regulations
regulations
what do we care about regulations
official business orders from the marquis
oh carmilio
well my little one
i leave you now to inspect the guards
but i coming back
oh carmilio
there is no hurry is there
oh no there is no hurry
lieutenant

señor carmilio
señor carmilio

pepita maria rosados
the night of the fiesta in the garden
oh pepita
si
yes yes i remember
we are searching for some escaped slaves
i had to meet pedro but i was a little late
so we know nothing about escaped slaves
my apologies
that all right lieutenant
oh lieutenant
would you care for some fruit
no thanks i have no time
a melon perhaps
some other time
the melons are very good
pedro how many times must i tell you
no no no no no

oh no
pepita will get you out of trouble partner
so my guards have begun
to smoke the rats out of their holes
theyre to be hanged captain alvarado
yes excellency
one moment your excellency
i should like a sporting chance
i have no time to waste señor
the stakes are good
my neck against an opportunity
to capture peter blood
if you find the fruit peddler
who released the slaves
youll have no reason to set sail tomorrow
because he is captain blood
why should i believe you
the only slaves who were freed
were men from his ship the avenger
very well fairfax you win
you may keep your neck
provided of course
you can tell me where blood is now
im afraid i cant tell you
but im sure there someone here who can
you have only to say where blood is
stop it
youre wasting your time uncle
if you want to know where blood is
release him and ill tell you
you
yes
well please forgive the oversight
his ship was anchored in the cove
on the other side of the island
are you sure
he told me himself
find captain valdez
the santa paula will sail at once
yes excellency
it already too late uncle
by now blood ship will be far out to sea
one moment excellency
blood can hardly change the tides
if his ship was in the cove it is still there
waiting to get over the shallows
and it will be three hours
before the tide will permit him to sail
señor fairfax
apparently you are still of value
we will reach the cove in two hours
get a guard have him taken to the prison
lsabelita whether you intended it or not
you too have been of service
oh thank you milady
but you shouldnt have told him
i told him where blood was
because i wanted them to catch him
because you thought the captain
had already sailed
youre in love with him arent you
in love with a pirate
a cutthroat a liar and a cheat
youre wrong milady youre wrong
he may not have told you all about himself
but what he told you was true
every word of it

hi it jonathan
im at the opera house where are you
oh no
no no
surprise
jesus beth cant you take a joke
roland copping yes
oh fine
thank you very much
good bye
judge there no doubt in my mind mrs wheats
that you considered your life to be at risk
and in extreme conditions you acted
with resourcefulness and courage
i only hope that the scars that you and your husband
now possess will heal as quickly as possible
it is my opinion that the deceased was a tragic victim of his own misguided judgement
and it will be my recommendation that no charges
be laid against elizabeth mary wheats
by the department of
public prosecutions
and it is the finding of this inquest that death occurred by accident
you may stand down
jonathan
dont worry ill get it
yes
mrs wheats
yes
roland copping carton insurance
oh yes please
please come in
my husbands out back in the study

friend of ours so id prefer not to discuss
the subject in front of my wife
it been six months and our lives are
just starting to get back to normal so
understood
please
mum the word mum the word
thank you
well
everything seems to be in order
the police have got their hands full of course
trying to trace the missing cutlery

to be quite honest i dont reckon there
much chance of you seeing either of them again
which is
a bit of a shame really
would you like to see anything else
no no no ive taken up too much
of your time already mr wheats
ill just get straight home
and start processing the claim
which should take how long mr copping
oh if all goes well maybe two three weeks
so well be seeing you again

of course if youve got any other questions
you can always call me at home on this number

i hope im not interrupting anything
no not at all
i actually need to run a few details

honest that not all right
dont you think business hours would be
a better time to discuss details
i am interrupting something arent i
um well look if you could just
spare me a couple of minutes
i could get rid of these questions and ill
probably be out of your hair for good
i dont think i have anything to say that
i havent said 00 times already
if you have any questions
i suggest you read the police report
i think ill come back tomorrow
that a good idea
oh for god sake

thank you
shouldnt be just a couple of minutes
now about this accomplice
when approximately did you hear the
getaway car driving off
i mean what time
i dont remember exactly
it was the neighbor who reported that
i was too busy trying to get to the opera
so well assume whoever this mystery
accomplice was saw you go inside
waited around in the hope that
michael would get wise and come out
heard the first scream and then
just took off
no i recall it took off just
after i entered the front door
i cant tell you the exact time
you do remember now
no i dont remember
so do you recall
i
i dont know why youre
well what do i take as fact beth
recall or remember
did you identify a driver
no mr copping please
oh im sorry
it an old habit i picked up from my father
he was a war hero you know
this was grand-dad
it very old
you see how they shine
it always said that in the right hands
they would become transparent
the numbers would just melt together
they can do wonderful things
mr copping
what are you talking about
my dice
well theyre very nice dice but
i dont see what relevance they have
to your being here
what relevance
to 3 says we continue our discussion now
4 to 6 says i return tomorrow
very well mr wheats i shall return tomorrow
ill make sure im in
now just hold on a minute
goodness me look at the time

you seen this fork before
yes it ours
i mean it looks like ours
where did you get this
these things turn up
jonathan
well ill leave it with you shall i
till morning when i return for the search

new search beth boring i know
but it is standard
company policy i can assure you
dont worry ill see myself out
good night
well at least we know what
happened to rosemary baby
what the hell is going on around here
the guy was here to assess the damage
to the tablenot to play yahtzee on it
jesus christ

nutcase tear apart my house then

going to bother me all

you know we spent all morning
at school today making these cities

i didnt know what to say then so i said
well maybe one or two trees grow
and then edward decided to tell them
the truth about christmas
and that they couldnt grow any trees
because of the yellow goop anyway
and i said well what happens at christmas time

what the matter was
and i saw in the corner little jack looking

that great
how come
simple really
just retracing the steps
michael allen he breaks into his
best friend house and having
just removed the first load of goods
he finds himself trapped inside by the
unexpected arrival of the now missing
cutlery owner mrs beth wheats
realizing that the game up
he decides on a bit of fun
so wielding the old
sunday roast carver
he takes the joke a little
bit too far as usual
his reward oh dear
a six inch crossbow bolt
right through the heart
and the mystery accomplice does not
speed off into the night with the goods
what are you talking about
well the mystery accomplice stands
patiently outside the opera house
awaiting the arrival of his
faithful wife

roland copping you know the most honest
and unique period of life is childhood
i mean the only way that child is going
to learn that jumping off the monkey bar
is going to hurt him
is by taking the chance and jumping
off the monkey bar
which i suppose makes children
the biggest gamblers of all
still doesnt last forever
kids grow up
dont they

nothing new im frankly
no leads at all as a matter of fact
you see stolen goods of this nature
are always the most difficult kind
and well your things being solid silver and all
well i wouldnt take any bets on them
turning up in a pawn shop
as sad as this must be to hear im afraid
were just going to have to say good bye
to your silverware
which is a great shame i know
it was a beautiful set

from what your husband tells me
impossible to replace
no i mean yes
im not sure
oh my god

jonathan
deck the hall with bells of holly
tra-la-la-la-la la-la la-la
hello beth you put your tree
out early this year
at least you dont have to
eat with your fingers anymore
what is the matter with you
are you completely insane
what more do you want from us
oh the holiday in tahiti the house in the country
but for the moment id be content with the bmw
where jonathan
roland copping
afternoon nurse
hello
excuse me
hello
metthew
beth hi honey
im home did you have a good day
oh yes yes i did two police turned up
with their crossbow
and your silverware was hung
out to dry on a christmas tree
jesus what happened to you
and why werent you at the office
where the hell have you been
ive been on a little field trip
and if i do say so myself i think ive struck gold
everyone got an achilles heel
and roland copping got a whopper
did you hear me
hello
he sent the police over this afternoon
he set us up i almost got arrested
and then i threw up on them
good girl
i should have thought about this earlier
the first day he came in here he gave us
his card which said please call home
he doesnt have an office he only works
from home it was like an invitation and it
there it all there
where the mobile phone
listen to you you sound like a madman
what the hell is going on
i dont have time to explain
ill tell you everything when im set up
jonathan tell me now
i found a hole beth a hole
i went there today to his house
i followed him
there might be a way out there a chance
that we can turn the tables but we have to play him
at his own game
that it isnt it
whether it playing
with toy soldiers
or ripping off insurance companies
it all just a game
yes
but it his game and at
the moment were losing
get out of my way
one elephant two elephants three elephants
stop it
four
ive had enough
i dont want to play anymore
so
what are the options
we can go to the police and maybe
spend what the next 0 years in jail
or we can give him everything and
let him suck us completely dry
or we can fight
we play or we pay
and i can win just 48 hours that all i need
just two days and this whole thing will be over
two days huh
two days to win this one and it will all be over
oh really
and then what what happens next
another insurance claim
or is that too small now
how about insider trading
does that sound attractive
where does it stop jonathan
please
i cant do this on my own
hello roland
jonathan
ive always had a soft spot
for german craftsmanship
fear not shell have a good safe home
oh i took out a cover note this morning
just in case you decided to cancel the insurance
last chance jonathan
roland copping
we have to talk
is that you beth
yes
fine well when would you like to get together
how about tonight
tonight
is that a problem
no
it not a problem
it not a problem at all
see you next year mr copping
i really am very pleased
you came to my party beth
is anybody else coming
no
i know you didnt know it was my birthday
so i dont expect a present
but i would like to give you one
if you really want to give us a present
stop what youre doing
my life is falling apart
my husband thinks it all
some kind of weird game
so here the deal
you can have the house
you can have the car you can have everything
i dont want it anymore
and in return
you let us go
i wish it were that simple
but the choice isnt mine
you know choice is a wonderful thing
but too much of it can lead to hesitation
and he who hesitates
loses his parking space
so you have to find that middle ground
and ive found 6
oh for god sake
cut it out
i cant
well i can
you cant hurt me anymore roland
you cant take anything
more away from me
because i have nothing
left to give you
i dont care what number your
goddamn dice rolls because i
dont give a shit anymore
happy birthday roland
and in a really weird way
thank you
where are you going
4 to 6 and i call jonathan

present state of health
achieved whilst trying to humor his brother

spoiled unpopular little brat

she called me
you want to tell me
how long

dealing come on what
are you trying to say
wait a minute
was she a junkie
or was she pushing
or what
you school me
we found 50000
uncut pure junk
in her bedroom
how does that read
that a lie
cloris was a little wild
she might have had
a few heavy boyfriends
here and in dc
but she was not dealing
no way i knew her
jake she was my friend
friends in dc
what kind of friends
politicians maybe
i dont know
do you know anyone
who would invite her
to a big-time party
we found an invitation
made out to her name
now who were some
of her friends honey
i dont know them
personally
publicly maybe
i dont know anything
about that
then she was killed
because of the junk
no believe me
this time
she was not into dope
that was not her thing
then why was she
killed honey
i think the man
has a point
sure wish
i had some beer
o lord i give to you
the soul
of this young woman
a child of god
who always held out
her hand to others
who always gave
and never asked in return
we ask thee
almighty god
to love cloris
as we have loved her
and take her
into your kingdom
the lord is my shepherd
i shall not want
he makes me lie down
in green pastures
excuse me a minute
he leads me
beside still waters
he restores my soul
he leads me in the path
of righteousness
for his name sake
even though i walk
through the valley
of the shadow of death
i fear no evil
for thou art with me
thy rod and thy staff
they comfort me
thou preparest
a table before me
in the presence
of my enemy
thou anointest
my head with oil
my cup overflows
surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me
all the days
of my life
it him colt
it who
it--it--
that funny
i dont see anybody
tires squealing
let get this straight
you say some gal
stole the hearse
that right
how do you suckers
find these problems
any idea who she was
look lieutenant
all i know it was
a black female
about 57
if i might say so
she was kind of
attractive
oh yeah she had
this large bag
hanging
over her shoulder
a camera gadget bag
exactly
jake colt is friday
into stealing hearses now
come on lieutenant
you know
better than that
she must have
spotted someone
from that tarr shooting
at the airport
she grabbed the first
thing available--
a hearse
what are you
going to do
stick her
in the ground for it
man the gal got
more balls than brains

the wall mama
but youre gonna let him
get away oh no
come on higher
he the one that--
he tried to kill
blake tarr
he the assassin
oh god
maybe we should send
for a matron to search her
oh man
you had no right
to do that friday
stealing a hearse
for christ sake
and destroying
public property
and losing a $600 camera
is that your way
of not getting involved
mr riley it was
the man that--
and do you know
what it cost glance
to keep you out of jail
and what it liable
to cost us
if that funeral director
decides to sue
or press charges
there was nothing
else i could do
yeah and my old man
invented the cotton gin
cant you get it under
your skull friday
that your life
is in danger
and that somebody is
trying to kill you
so youre out
of the slammer
i thought i wouldnt see you
until visiting hours
how was the bread
and water
you got something
for me colt
that depending
on whether or not
you didnt spend up
all your money
on lawyers
and bail bondsmen
i might look into
something for you
in washington dc
tomorrow
like what
like a bunch of flowers
sent to cloris boston
funeral from a no-name friend
friday saw it
tell me do you know a fellow
named david lee hart
the senator
cloris boston had
a senator stashed away
sure cloris had quite
a few friends in dc
she would fly down there
for these weekend dates
some brother named
ford malotte set them up
that a coincidence
he the man--
and i use the term loosely--
that im going to see
all right
when do we go
youre not going
anyplace
aw mr riley--
no way
please i got to find out
who killed cloris
i want to know about
this black widow thing
and i want to prove
that she was not dealing
what you really want
is senator hart
to send you
some flowers
for your funeral
here the print
clear as a bell
the blow-up
came out perfect
it him
this is the man that
been trying to kill me
let get
a print of this
to the police
right away
i want this guy
caught
before he catches up
with friday
but monk now you see
why i have to go to dc
friday there
absolutely no damn way
that you or
glance magazine
is going on a manhunt
to washington
and that
the bottom line
you might as well
forget it no way
no way
colt for god sake
friday
couldnt we have
met him on a park bench
why this place
would
the white house lawn
suit you better
mr hawkins
anywhere is better
than this
and besides since
youve brought me here
im beginning to wonder
about you friday
as dracula
dont be afraid
i wont bite you
this is
a public place
youll be all right
yeah but i think
ill need protection
oh jesus
excuse me miss
could you--
could you tell me
where i can find
ford malotte
please
maybe what
your business sweetie
just tell him that
friday foster is here
from glance magazine
he right over there
his muscles are bigger
than mine
and that not all
um ford malotte
coochie coochie
friday foster
from glance magazine
how are you darling
it always so nice to meet
someone from the press
and who is he
colt hawkins
private investigator

sit down
i hate cliches

some uh lieutenant
jake wayne
called me about it
earlier
ah cloris
a marvelous girl
i mean nobody
nobody
could wear things
the way she could
with a body
put together in heaven
with tender loving hands
and to think that
that simple policeman
would intimate
that i would terminate
such a talented girl
im afraid
that impossible
that a private party
that reception
oh malotte youve
booked dates for cloris
with government vips
and senators
now why cant you
do it for me
but that
was different
she had
that uh touch
friday look malotte
cloris and i
grew up together
we were like sisters
if she can be invited
to this reception so can i
interesting maybe
with the right gown
and a new coiffure
you might pass
for her
but there no way
you know
there is some reason
why you dont want me
at this reception
are you afraid that
black widow might be there
you know
about black widow
friday darling
when you are
fooling around
with ambitious men
like senator hart
it can be hazardous
to your health
take my advice

go back go home
get laid

or something
what youre trying to say
is you wont help us right

little woman

with or without
your help mr malotte
i am going to be
at that reception
well suit yourself

out of here

on your high throne
and feel safe

up the river
and uh we could

for uh purposes
well you know
then again reverend
im not so sure
reverend franklin not only
has a way with a prayer
but beautiful women
as well
i dont think
ive had the pleasure
oh yes
senator hart
i want you to meet
miss friday foster
a very very pretty
church reporter
and what church are you
a reporter for
you see senator hart
that not exactly the truth
i really came here
to see you
regarding a mutual friend
im sorry we missed you
at the funeral
funeral whose
cloris boston
i think we ought to get
to know each other better
excuse us reverend
reverend sure
and you still
have an invitation
to come up to jericho
you fine sister you
your flowers were
a comfort to cloris
it was the least
i could do
she was a friend
just a friend
but that not what
the dc grapevine says
a smart girl like you
shouldnt believe
in gossip should you
excuse me david
i spoke
with the congressman
and he has agreed
to the meeting
good uh
friday foster
this is my
executive assistant
charles foley
miss foster
mr foley
uh charles
miss foster and i
are going
to my place
to uh discuss some
mutual interests
so watch the store
will you
yes sir nice
meeting you miss foster
while youre
in washington
if i can be of any
assistance whatsoever
feel free to call
when you do
just ask for charley
thank you
ill remember that
charley
hart after
one divorce
and 2 years
in washington
one gets to know
his people
more brandy
more brandy and i might
lose all my inhibitions
maybe worse
look what happened
to cloris
cloris was only a pal
just a friend
so we made it
a few times
but our relationship
was only physical
im really sorry
about what happened
if i could change it
i really would
will you believe me
trust me
then you can start
trusting me
you can tell me
what the hell is going on
ok
find yourself a certain
mr blake tarr
and it will all
come as clear
as monday wash
im told he the man
behind it all
now why would he plan
his own assassination
it all part
of a big power play
to make you believe
it something
it isnt
and what
your power play
are you something
youre not too
now what will
all the gossips say
oh they will probably
say that i made love
to one of the most
beautiful women
dc has ever seen
youre very sure
of yourself arent you
arent you
when i think about it
it just as well
the girl wasnt killed
you really
think so huh
here you are sir
i thought you said
she came from
glance magazine
i did
it seems she came
to washington
and bluffed her way
into the reception
specifically to meet
with senator hart
it seems she tied
the murder of her friend
to the senator
did the senator
tell her anything
no
well that good
isnt it
did she tell the
senator anything
only that shed heard
about black widow
arent you worried
about that charles
that why i think
she can be of use to me
if the senator
will go along
and i think he will
or else ill have to tell him
how those thousands of
contributors to his campaign
is really just
one big contributor--
enos hartman griffith
who is now willing
to go along with me
well by herself
she nothing
but with glance
magazine behind her
she may be able
to help you
flush out blake tarr
the senator has already
put a bug in her ear
he said that blake tarr
is the one that can tell her
about the murder
of her friend cloris
well he certainly
right about that
isnt he charles
blake tarr
is the answer
to all our problems
mr griffith
well that what the
senator said mr riley
his office would
give us full cooperation
colt why dont you put
some sugar in your cereal
nahi dont
like it too sweet
hey blackhawk
you got any money
ive got barrels
of it why
i got some
dynamite perfume
out-of-sight watches
ladies lingerie
and a whole lot
of other stuff for sale
so now youre
hustling huh
nopestrictly
black capitalism
friday if glance
doesnt want the story
then maybe
somebody else will
whyd you do that
whyd you
hang up on him
call him back
why should
i call him back
he doesnt care
ive tried so hard
well youre going
to have to try harder
come on
telephone rings
oh mr riley im sorry
for talking to you like that
oh madame rena
never mind that
ive got information about
your trip to washington
oh what
i cant talk on the phone
but i think youd better
get your little derriere
down here to my office now
friday i said now
was that monk begging
your forgiveness
uh-uh no it wasnt
it was madame rena
and she wants me
to come over
can you give me
a ride
only if you
promise me
there wont be
any dead bodies
laying around
now promise
all right i promise
indistinct conversations
madame rena
it friday foster
why do you have to
stir things up
watch out
colt dont let him
get away
youre wrong
about black widow
but senator hart said--
get a pencil and write
what i say to you
if you want
to know the truth
what am i doing here
son of a bitch
aah
rena call this number
when you can
but whose
theyllexplain
youre wrong about
blackwidow
rena rena
she dead colt
well that makes
two for today
because one
of those killers
wont be
hunting you no more
did she say
anything
just umnothing
hello
im friday foster
and im calling
for madame rena
no she cant
come to the phone
she dead
just now
no he dead too
hey i havent
the slightest idea
hey she just
asked me to call
before she died
that all i know
come where
the city bank
building
hello hello
friday hello
is anybody up here
helicopter flying overhead
miss foster
im blake tarr
i dont care who you are
you have got no right
to come up here
and scare me
half to death
look im sorry
but there are
certain precautions
i have to take
rooftops and helicopters
and henchmen
rena was right
youve got guts
what do you know
about rena
she worked for me
it because of her
and malotte
that i came back
to the states
they told me
what was going on
and what is going on
black widow
so senator hart
was right after all
you are behind
black widow
what else did the charming
senator tell you
that you know who killed
my friend cloris
mm-hmm and that
i go around
killing my own people
that i set myself up
to be assassinated
at the airport
come on does that
make sense to you
that hart a clever
son of a--
you know
he got everybody
believing in that
unity scam of his
when in reality
it just a front
a power grab
i think that black widow
is a code name for it
david lee hart huh
rena said you could be
trusted that why im here
this is all a little
confusing you know
ive got to know
the when the what
the way of
hart timetable
all she was able
to find out
was that it had
something to do
with st valentine day
that the day
after tomorrow
right but the question is
will you help me
why would i
because ive asked you
youre quite sure
of yourself arent you
are all black
millionaires like that
probably
it goes with the job
some job
blake i cant say
i dislike it
coming from the ghetto
all the way to the top
was quite a trip
but im curious
about you
there are things
id like to know
like what
like who is friday foster
where she going
who am i
that a funny question
well first
im a woman
second i am
a photographer
and a big sister
to a little brother
who really
a 40-year-old man
chuckles
and umi like
cats and dogs
and horses and men--
but not necessarily
in that order
i make
my own decisions
and im a gemini
that it
well that enough
well as far as
where im going
do you mean now
or in the future
either way
i see that im
going to be
getting
into something
i did not expect
what did you expect
you know
what i expected
i expected
you to be a rat
but youre
different
baby you forget
im straight off the block
i know that what
canceled my theory
you treat a person
like a person
and a woman
like a woman
i try to treat a lady
like a lady
happy valentine day
colt you didnt phone
you didnt write
you didnt do nothing
you know you
could have been dead
for all i know
well i wasnt
was i
you know for two days
youre missing
and the minute
youre back
you drag me here
would you mind telling
me why were here
we are going to
see the senator
i want to ask him
a few questions
and i want some
no-jive answers
to what
to where are all
the black leaders
i have been calling them
all over the place
and no one seems to know
where they are
how would
the senator know
now would a pimp
lose track of his stable
i understand youre
asking for senator hart
im his
executive secretary
would you tell him
that friday foster
is here to see him
and i dont intend
to be kept waiting
well youre going to have
to because he not in
and he wont be
at all today
could you call him
on the phone
he didnt leave
a number sorry
what about
charles foley
with the senator
colt
colt this has got to be
the day for black widow
hmm
on valentine day
now doesnt that mean
something to you
a massacre
did he say anything
about today anything
well the only thing
he said before he left
was that this was the day
that the walls
come tumbling down
dont make
much sense to me
nothing much would
i dont get it does it
mean anything to you
the walls come
tumbling down
joshua fit the battle
of jericho huh
that it
jericho dont you know
what jericho is
sweetheart im
a sunday-school dropout

what youre--
that reverend
noble franklin place

and hate--
every important black
leader in the country

-okay ive been thinking about
this a lot since the last time
i saw you what i wanted

i think that what you are doing
and what you are is really
brave
and the fact that youre acting on it
you know like it
revolutionary all these ideas
that people have about like
aging and beauty and what makes
somebody desirable youre
going against that
youre fighting against nature
and do you see how
radical that is
and what i also wanted
to tell you is that
if you were a girl
youd be on my list
-desiree
-but the fucked up part is
that what you are means
that we cant be together anymore
you know that right
i dont know what i am
my god i wish we were
the ones escaping
ill text you
-okay go
go
i love you
hey
did you have any more
roommates after that
-here and there
i was even married once
if you can believe that
married to a woman
at the time it was the only
option it was the 70
even in the theater world
if you werent married after
the age of 40 there was
something wrong with you
were you in love with her
it was a kind of love
miraculously we even conceived
one drunken winter night
two years after our son was born
she divorced me
and took him away to another city
from that point on
i was a confirmed bachelor
good afternoon young lady
i wonder if you could direct
me to the notions department

my own grandpa mean as a snake
my parents put him into
some retirement home
sunny valley or something

in his case elder abuse
would be entirely justified
um i need a map of canada
sure thing
it cute that youre
traveling with your grandpa
where are you guys headed
we havent really decided
are you staying in ontario
-yeah
-maybe i can help you
when i was a kid my family and i
used to go rent a cottage
around here it really pretty
there are a lot of lakes

would you mind paying for this
dear boy i left my wallet
in the car and dont forget
ill have cigarettes
any brand
one of the few advantages
of being old invisibility
youre crazy
am i
-we have to start planning for the future
money isnt going
to hold out forever
sun block
who knows we might end up
in palm springs
-i already told you
i like your wrinkles
im going to keep this

how you treat me
what did he want
that boy
he saw the map and he wanted
to know if i needed directions
so were here and were
trying to get to here
to be honest im not sure
im up for such a long trip
so soon after coup de coeur
that place really took
the vinegar out of me
what are you saying
-what im saying is perhaps
we should rest for a few days
before pressing on
you havent been telling
anyone about us have you
-dont be silly
they would never understand
-what about your son
-i wouldnt worry about my son
he paid for the home
but he hasnt been
in touch for many years
he hasnt introduced me
to my own grandchildren
he never really got used to
the idea of having an old queen
like me for a father
it always embarrassed him
what were you talking
to that guy about
what guy
at the dinner
you seemed to be talking a lot
i already told you directions
and why were you laughing
-i suppose i made a joke
you know how i am
-it must have been pretty
funny then i guess
-what are you harping on this
dont tell me youre jealous
jealous of an old
sack of bones like me
-because i asked you to be careful
about what you say
to people learn to keep your mouth
shut in public and i dont
have to be this way
id never thought id live
to see the day
-im going for a walk
are you coming

happy birthday melvin
that time of year thou
mayst in me behold
when yellow leaves or none
or few do hang upon those
boughs which shake against
the cold bare ruined
choirs where late
the sweet birds sang
in me thou seest the
twilight of such day
as after sunset fadeth in
the west which by and by
black night doth take
away death second self
that seals up all in rest
you know i have been thinking
about you said before and
it not just about the sex
i really think im in love
with you

that i have met you before
i cant get over it

on the table in a big huff
it turned out the school was holding
auditions for a midsummer night dream

id like to try
but i cannot compete
and i cannot compete here
therell always be a rainbow
at the end of the field
yeah still will
this is so cool
i love animals but living in an apartment
it a kinda difficult
have you ever been to new york
once on a school trip
so you probably went to the
met and the guggenheim and
i skipped out and
went to the village
youre gonna get it
gotcha
therell always be a rainbow
at the end of the field
can you two go play
somewhere else
sony i was going
for pearson
bad aim i guess
now im asking you
did my aunt ever give you money
why are you so upset ive
never seen you like this before
did she ever give you money
you mean did she make donations
i mean did she ever
give you money
yes or no
just give me an answer
yes she did
so my rightful inheritance
was given to you and your zoo
no boyd i mean
she used to bring by food
she been doing that for years
and every once in a while shed very
generously donate some money for the cause
but i think
that was her business
it my business when the cash
was supposed to come to me
i was under the impression
it was hers to give
i want my $50000 brenda
$50000
are you of your mind
im talking 40 or 50 dollars
every once in a while $50000
you saw an old lady with a
ridiculous amount of compassion
for your flea-bitten strays
and you milked her wait just a minute
if youre suggesting that i took
advantage of someone that was my friend
you used her
you tricked her
ive never seen
$50000 in my life
well that my money
and i want it back
so im going to get a court order
and have your bank account checked
go ahead
i have nothing to hide
i think youd better leave
ill be back
what a jerk
he such a creep
the other day im all alone
and he walks right in
without even knocking
i was totally freaked
if he does it again call me
ill kick his butt
he practically
called brenda a liar
and i mean you should see all these
things she does with these animals
she nurses them back to health
she finds them new homes
she looked really upset
i heard something
come on
no i did
nat
dad look whether
you like it or not
there is something
in this house
i told you i can feel it
sometimes right after she died
i thought i felt your mom
presence in the apartment
little things like thinking a mug she
always used for her morning coffee
had been moved on the shelf
or a hint of her perfume
all of a sudden
but i was just so used
to those everyday things
i imagined them
but i didnt imagine her
photo flying off the piano
or the piano keys moving and
i just dont think it a coincidence
that mrs ashboro knew her
im just saying that your mind is
very open to this kind of thing right now
the people i interview
one thing in common
they all lost someone
and they want them back
half the stories im tracking for my book turn
out to have perfectly logical explanations
so what about that guy
who was hung for treason
you said ten people
had seen him
that just
an annual halloween prank
it appeals to those people
who like to think
that ichabod crane
is still out there
riding through the night
without his head
well he is isnt he
tell you what
let both you and i
stay up tonight
that way if something happens
well both be there to see it
okay deal
deal
hey natalie hi
hey
this is my dad
dad brenda
wes merritt
hi
so you must be the animal lady
i mean you look after strays
dogs natalie tells me
yeah and natalie tells me
youre a writer
im sure i mustve read
some of your books
you read a lot of history
im a history buff
it hard not to be
living around here
in fact george washington
used to visit ringwood all the time
one of his chief mapmakers lived in
the area a general erskine i think
yeah erskine ive been
meaning to look him up
yeah
yeah

you want brenda yancey
farm right
i can make that happen
im the assistant
client funds manager
at the ringwood
savings and loan downtown
i
i know things
that most people dont
like
like brenda yancey a client
and she in deep trouble
way behind on
her mortgage payments
i could maneuver a
foreclosure for a fee
you know boyd i think we maybe
able to do some business after all
well nat i guess this is the case
of the watched pot never boiling
isnt that what grandma
always used to say
all these old houses
are full of strange sounds
theyre creaking and moving
all the time
it not the house
it not your mom
why do you think
your mom would come back
because she knows
knows what
so i can say goodbye
you said goodbye nat
i didnt say everything i needed
to there wasnt enough time
i know that so why
didnt you tell me sooner
i know you think it was wrong
maybe it was
but i didnt tell you right away
because your mother
asked me not to
we were just trying
to protect you
we did what we thought was best
if you think that a decision
was wrong im sorry
god knows at the time
it was hard to think at all
you shouldve thought of me
im sorry
let get some sleep now
you wanna come up now
in a minute
margaret
margaret was it you
i was hearing
what do you want
no stay
hey when did you get a cat
you saw a cat
yeah
where
in the front window
youre sure
it gone now
it looked sort of like margaret
it must have jumped down
but you saw it
yeah quit psyching me out
you mean you didnt get a cat
at least im not
completely crazy
so ever since we moved in
it just been so weird
things going bump in the night
piano playing
pictures flying
it really freaked me out
i didnt really know
what to think
come on
dont look at me like that
im not crazy
crazy people dont know
when theyre crazy
kurt i saw margaret i saw
her ghost it was a real ghost

way to the bank anyway
it no trouble
see ya
ive never seen brenda
in clean jeans before
she dressed to impress

possessive of daddy
maybe you should go home
they might need a chaperone

this is a great book
this is great thank you
good i hope it helps
im sure it will
so are you in ringwood
just for the research
or are you planning
to stay at all
playing it by ear i guess
i thought a change would be a
good thing for natalie for both of us
natalie that a tough age
to lose your mother
yeah fifteen not the best time
for sure
she was having a very
hard time dealing with it
we both were
so we decided
to get out of the city
new beginnings and all that
i hope it was
the right thing to do
i hope so too

dont make fun of me please
i thought it was my mother
i really wanted it to be
youve just met me you
must think im really certifiable

i guess ill take that
as a compliment then
i just wish everything

a bag of food she wanted
my god

this is what she
wanted me to find
margaret you are
the most wonderful cat
natalie what are
you guys doing in here
i cant stand by and watch such a
dear friend be pulled in all directions
ive always intended to leave you and
your wonderful cause a healthy donation

when you truly need it
love to you brenda
mrs ashboro and margaret

in town to close you down
i know who started that
i cant help you
in the last month
ive had a half dozen complaints
animals going loose
scaring people getting into their garbage

im real sorry
i dont believe this
you win one battle
and you lose another
i just dont want you
to get messed up again
you could go to jail
im not going anywhere i

you swore you didnt
set that fire too
natalie

your aunt left it to me i will
have the bank freeze the funds
and brenda i will sue you to the
ends of the earth i have a letter
i have written proof

she was of sounder mind
than you boyd

i cant help it if she paid
it off i want my money
your plan didnt work
you didnt deliver
i want my money now
not until
she off the property
if i get you brenda land
itll make your little
development deal worth millions
if if you get her off
that big if boyd
ill get rid of her
i promise you
i know the right buttons
to push
i can do a lot more damage than
letting her dogs out riker believe me
much more
okay you do it
margaret
wait
margaret
where are you taking me
natalie what are you doing
here youve gotta get out
no natalie
youve got to get out of here
what are you doing
you got to open the barn door
put this over
your mouth and nose
who in there
kurt is that you
what going on
natalie
what are you two doing in here
okay so what were you
really doing in there
like i told brenda
i thought someone might try
and let the animals out again
i decided to check it out
the barn was full of
fumes when i got here
look i dont know what you heard pearson
and i talking about the other day
ill tell you what i heard
that pearson thinks youre
the one letting the animals out
and that you might
have to go to jail
i didnt let the animals out
and i dont have to go to jail
then what about the fire
he said something about
you setting a fire
so i went a little crazy
after my mom died
i set fire to some guy dump
and it got out of control
i got mandatory
community service
that why
im working at brenda
so youre forced to work here
no im not forced that
just the way it started
i used up my hours long ago
i just stayed
so why didnt you just tell me
like im gonna tell you im a juvenile
delinquent the moment i meet you
clearly that would
impress a girl right
so you wanted to impress me
i didnt know
what to do with you
brenda doesnt want me back
she thinks i did it
i didnt i swear
i know
there no way that happened
by accident tonight
somebody did it deliberately
and i have to find out who

that he speaks french
almost as well as english
mm-hmm he does
napier should appoint you
mrs jordan
as public relations
officer
yes youd make a splendid
plantation hostess
one of bryant nippies
oh what an excellent
idea tom
now when can i start
mr bryant
and what will be
your terms
i never talk business
at parties mrs jordan
and never
with beautiful women
aw
really
extraordinary
now i shouldve thought--
that it was a marvelous
opportunity
i quite agree tom
now mr bryant
you cant get out of this
let talk it over while
we dance shall we
delighted
im so glad you dont
mind my husband
rather schoolboy
sense of humor
oh i know some people do
especially rather
pompous people you know
on the contrary
i find him rather
refreshing
im so sorry
that over so quickly
tell me what part
of france are you from
medoc
oh the wine country
yes my father
had a vineyard
as big as one
of our plantations
oh i expect it is
quite small really
but it used to seem big to me
as big as the whole country
and you of course
was his princess
and then one day a rather
beaten-up representative
of the london suburban
wine company
came down the drive
with dust on his shoes
and his suitcase full of empty
bottles and dirty shirts--
and they lived happily
ever afterwards
in a manner of speaking
well it getting
frightfully late tom
i think we ought
to go home
let
well thank you so much
it been such a lovely party
so glad you enjoyed it
oh yes i did
let me show you around
napier one of these days
oh i should love it
mr bryant goes out
of his way to keep
the staff happy and the wives
particularly the wives
tom you are wicked
when youve been out here
as long as i have jordan
you may learn to mix
with our little community
what the hell
do you think i am
a new boy
comparatively speaking
three months
still in his first term huh
waiting for you to teach me
the nicknames
of all the masters
and what they call
the lavatories
in six form b
well i know what the peasants
call you anyway
come on let get some air
goodnight
goodnight
thank you
for the lovely party
what the matter
go on tell me
what the matter
oh i know i behaved
badly at the party
but i always behave
badly at parties
what about that party
that wine tasting party
your father gave remember
when i said i thought
the 953 vintage
reminded me of a rather
vivacious little cup of tea
that i found in the cafe
on the north circular road
remember
you laughed at that once
it was a long time ago
tom
tom coming to bed
coming to bed
tom
it a new year
so they told us
at the party
and what this
the thaw
oh be different please
try
different
what do you mean
different
stop being a child
what do you want me to be
grown-up and mature
like bryant
and all those idiots
with their funny hats
oh god it starting again
what are you smoking
for anyway
oh do you mind
i thought
if you had anything
interesting to say
id keep awake and listen
what do you want me to say
just how you think were going
to go on living together
that all
if you cant live with me
that your problem
oh yes
oh yes it always
my problem
what were you
doing when we met
buying wine for a firm
that went broke
married to a woman who never
cared what happened to you
oh gwen
tch
what a ridiculous name
at least she liked me
just as i was
hmm
with the boyish charm
well that wearing
a bit thin now
if you want to know the truth
and ill tell you the truth
you always wanted me
different didnt you
you always wanted
to change me
well i didnt succeed
in making a man of me
huh you sound like some
ridiculous headmaster
oh it not funny when you
say those things anymore
and it not funny
when youre rude at parties
now look i can be rude
to who i like you understand
im free
as far as being rude
is concerned
im absolutely free
no
youve got a job to look after
and a marriage remember
you make marriage sound
like some bloody awful
purchase agreement
pay up for 50 years
it yours when you die
oh how can you say that
when i came with you
when you didnt even have
a job or money or anything
i came to that dreary hotel
to provide the evidence
and the rooms we lived
in while you change jobs
and saved up to pay
for the cost of the divorce
nobody forced you
well i did it because
you were human
and you were funny
and you were alive
not just angry
with people for no reason
and hopeless for no reason
and never doing anything
that makes any sense
we just cant go on
we cant go on
we could go on if you
just be a wife
a wife
how could i be more
of a wife
well you can hate the same
people i hate for a start
and then you can stay at home
and bath the children maybe
do what
bath the children
if youd ever had any
you see im trying to sleep
i am sorry darling
well it too late
good morning gabriel
senor
you wish i to stay here
yes of course
you will give me protection
gabriel please
this is not my day
what are you talking about
you had the guns
last night
when people hear that
they go into the hills
my cousin
is on his way there
but if he could
stay here 2 3 days
he can sleep in kitchen
he very good cook
and another advantage
he plays guitar
all right
thank you senor
thank you
what is all this about anyway
we have a new president
oh congratulation
what his name
the new president
general zoreno
well viva zoreno
viva zoreno
viva rivera
good morning
hello
where is everybody
all our workers disappear
into their holes
as soon as there
any trouble
theyll be back
in a few days
in the meantime we got
a new face to look at
zoreno
yes
ive arranged for photograph
of him to be laid off
do we have to
just a little courtesy
napier would like
us to extend it
to the new man in power
exactly
is it over
bar the shooting
is there going to be
much more of that
i understand that rivera
has made a run for it
i heard it on the radio
i expect theyll have
caught him by now
there will be a trial
of course in the sports arena
2000 votes to none in favor
of the extreme penalty
they always send their disused
presidents to the sports arena
you made it sound
very quaint
im sorry
there a lot to
be said for rivera
provided we stick
to theory of course
abolishing the death penalty
freeing the press
granting the vote
to a lot of indians
who could neither
read nor write
and then what happens
the army takes over
by the way i see your friend
hernandez is with zoreno
still minister of justice
i always thought
he was intelligent
you better
take one of these
what that for
flag for your car
you may find it useful
if there any in trouble
what am i supposed
to do then
salute and sing
abide with me
you know i wish you
wouldnt make jokes
itd be far better
for your career with napier
if you were to stop
making jokes
jokes
on my way here this morning
i saw a man
he was running beside
the car with his face
all dabbed with
paint like a clown
he kept on sort of clawing
at the window
and then he screamed
something i didnt understand
well
they shot him
you could have done nothing
i could have stopped
just as well for you
that you didnt
why
because napier
might have got in wrong
with the new powers
you wont believe me jordan
but i was thinking of you
here you are doctor
thanks
beautiful isnt it
you know youre
the only napier wife
thatd buy these things
go into the other houses
and what do you get
plaster galleons
in full sail
why do you want to see me
im pregnant
well congratulations
to you both
but tom doesnt know
i wanted
to tell him that
oh surely that
the wife privilege
oh no no no
not about the baby
i wanted to tell him
that im going home
why
say that the climate
doesnt suit me
tell him i cant stay
for medical reasons
tell him that
oh you know what to say
what the real reason
im tired
im sick of smiling
and pretending
that all his sneers and insults
are just school boy jokes
i love to laugh at
last night he
yeah
last night he said
that it was my fault
we didnt have any children
well there no reason
why you shouldnt have
a perfectly healthy baby
if you take care of yourself
ive had two miscarriages
each time wed be moving
leaving a job that
isnt grand enough
for his great
big personality
well please
will you tell him doctor
that tom
well he early
isnt it
i cant think what has
happened unless
unless what
oh nothing
ill leave you two together
you tell him
please doctor

no i was passing
youre home early
oh plantation
is all deserted
so i drove through the town
been a little rough
there i understand
you could call it that
they dont last you know
never last very long
but there are times out here
when you have to look
in the opposite direction
god what a country
suits me
of course it doesnt
suit everyone
your wife for instance
what the matter
is claire ill
nothing nothing
to worry about
but may i speak
to you as man to man

should i be caught
no one here has seen me mr
jordan
and youre not
going to get caught
im gonna hide you
where youre safe

manners hugo

hello

something for your cough eh
we must go see about the meats
it too bad of the jordans
senor
theyre here
police
soldiers with the senora
your husband
went to work this morning
then what happened
come mrs jordan
there is a limit
to our patience
mrs jordan
do not try to put us off
did your husband
not drive his car
good evening
hello darling
well look at all that ash
filthy smoking habits
mr jordan
yes
we have been waiting
for you mr jordan
good because i wish
to lodge a complaint
a complaint
at tribulacion at the bridge
some of your undisciplined
soldiers fired on my car
i can only imagine
they were drunk
you did not stop
we had a report
from tribulacion
of course i didnt stop
for those trigger-happy idiots
whatd you expect me to do
stay and get shot
may even happen
this mr jordan
there was someone
with you wasnt there
i saw him leave
there was no one
look there
a perfectly good ashtray
will you mind
did you or not have
a passenger
answer us
yes i did
a strange sort of passenger
that lies on a floor
hidden under a cloth
i thought that was
rather eccentric myself
but then a solution
occurred to me
i dont think he wanted
me to know he was there
you did not know
perhaps he crawled into the
van when it was in the garage
maybe he wanted a free lift
some tramp rather
it very amusing
oh it true
theyre always doing it
tramps women
children chickens
always crawling into cars
youd think they
want to live there
maybe it the housing shortage
in your beautiful country
well are you satisfied
gentlemen
not quite mr jordan
where is your car now
in the garage of course
i didnt hear you drive up
maybe because you
were shouting so much
now are you satisfied
one more thing
you have another
more thing to tell us
what that
where is your passenger
he still asleep i expect
do you want to see him
no need
for you to come darling
oh id like some air
open quickly
quickly
what are you laughing about
oh it marvelous
isnt it
i mean youve
gotten thrown out
of some strange places
at quick notice
but youve never done
anything like this before
i try to keep you out of it
oh that right
tom jordan the lone hero
with complete disregard
for his own safety
he snatched his wife
from a nice clean bedroom
and saved a sick man
from going to hospital
the regiment is proud of you
oh im sorry
oh but let be
sensible tom
well go straight
back to tribulacion
ill go and see
colonel hernandez
and ill explain
everything to him
thank goodness
he civilized
i think youre gonna
miss your nice little laugh
with colonel hernandez
why
because were going
to los indos river
which is about 30 miles
further on
well cross that somehow
and then well walk
to the frontier
oh i see
carrying a wounded man
with us i suppose
yes if he cant walk
but i can walk mr jordan
if you would stop the car
i owe you so much
please spare me the pain
of causing unpleasantness
between you and your wife
you dont and im not
going to stop the car
mr jordan please
look it wont save
us to drop you
you said that yourself
yes but you would travel
light much lighter
who are you
oh forgive my manners
mrs jordan
i should have
introduced myself
pedro rivera
who
pedro rivera i am i think
president of the republic
i doubt if there was
time for an election
that was quite delicious
oh the wife manages
the fancy stuff all right
it the boiled egg
we cant cook well can we
herbert
it not the egg
itself so much
it the time that seems
to be at fault
really
herbert
it either pure water
or of a rock like consistency
herbert mr bryant
isnt interested in eggs
yeah there a simple
device on the market
for checking the time of eggs
ah now that must
be the jordans
i hope he isnt tight
oh good evening
colonel
mr bryant i am looking
for one of your employees
jordan where is he
well that what
wed like to know
what jordan been doing
some ridiculous joke
i believe it serious
to help a traitor escape
what
a man was found
hiding in jordan car
well if he was found
jordan drove off with him as
he was about to be arrested
we wish to find
this enemy of the state
who is he
our ex-president
rivera
yes
i bet you were member
of his government
when we last met of course
i was justice mr bryant
and justice does not change
with governments
i believe that is true
even in england
so mr and mrs jordan
are expected here
quite a coincidence
yes but they
havent come
we shall see
is there no longer
enough adventure
for you in the manufacture
of sugar mr bryant
lopez
hey colonel
what the game
in england i believe
you call it hide and seek
you knew who he was
of course
swann told me
the president
does it make any difference
well you could have told me
im not a child you know
oh but no everything
has to be so secret
you have to do everything
on your own
oh for god sake i let
one man get killed today
isnt that enough
besides
what
oh nothing
i need to find
a place to cross
mrs jordan
yes
mrs jordan your husband
was worried about your safety
it would have been dangerous
for you to know who i was
look if you expect
anyone to be reasonable
i dont
i only hope we can all stay
together for a short time
of course
operator
operator you cut me
off three times already
what happened
it seems a car has been hidden
in your bushes mr bastian
a car
mr bryant you still say
you know nothing
of jordan movements
there are people
on the other side
they couldnt have
got here already
could they
oh look a fire
what would really happen
if they caught us
theyre not going
to catch us
farm workers
on their way to the hills
all right then well cross
as soon as it gets light
only if theyve gone
wouldnt it be safe
with them
ill not be safe
if i was seen by anyone
mrs jordan
anyone at all
let eat
it still
new year day
yes it is
a year ago today i was advised
to have general zoreno shot
you should
have listened
of course if we were
the swiss family robinson
i would find
the dry martini tree
and wed all have
a nice stiff cocktail
well when in doubt
have a picnic
what a sad song
cheese
on the contrary
it is a song of happiness
but dont they care
what happening
they have seen
too many changes
when i was a child
i worked at one
of those farms
i had to wait
on the great landlord
wherever he went all day
i have to stand
beside him
with a tall glass
filled with ice
one night i woke up
the dogs were barking
a man had stolen something
from the big landlord
and he had him half
buried in the ground
and the horses
rode over him
they woke us up
and made us watch
so we would learn
from his mistake
i grew up and i went away
and studied studied
and when i came back
the dogs barked again
that same landlord
he was planted
in the ground
and the horses
rode over him
all that studying to make
the dogs bark again
you know different dogs
of course this time
but you had
no part of that
what do you want
mr jordan
a good reason
for saving my life
wake up you dont
have to swim
i was dreaming
about the room
i booked last night
at the cosmopolitan
single and with bath
what did you say
i said you
dont have to swim
the great river just about
comes up to my knees
and it firm
gravel underneath
so we can
drive across
what the hell
are you doing
he saw us
all right
it was a mistake
we should have
silenced the boy
he saw us
if you want to come
with us get in the car
come on
we got to get out
of here quick
ill open the back
mr jordan
mr jordan
tom
that my leg tom
one bar of chocolate
and a corkscrew
and no bottles
to open
well at least
they were worth saving
you are very angry
with me mr jordan
i was only trying
to help
trying to help
not for myself
please understand
there are men women
and children there
who will be shot
unless i can get out for help
and you mrs jordan
and your husband
what is one boy
against so many
perhaps it true
now if you think that true
why are we doing all this
please let us
forget about the boy
it not so bad
mrs jordan
in those hills not very far
there a village san pablo
people there are still
my friends i think
they would help us
if we could reach them
oh tom
he looks bad
he alive
isnt he
he breathing
what else
does he expect
let go
come on
mr jordan
your watch
ive even lost
your watch for you
save your breath
for the mountains
come on now
we shall certainly
catch them
napier should
have financed
the fatherland party
mr bryant
not rivera escape
but we did not
do either
no
im afraid
we wont believe that
unless it proved
at rivera trial
and if it isnt
napier plantation
will be taken over
for the benefit
of the people
but weve given your people
work money hospitals
and weve never
indulged in politics
then youd better
start indulging now
on the winning side
for a change
they must be trying to cross
the frontier to bareya
you see we know
they crossed the river
a boy was given a present
a watch with the initials tj
tom jordan perhaps
they came from here
san pablo
no doubt
he helped them
the people there
are very backward
of course they may
not have heard
the good news
of our revolution
i think we shall have
to announce it to them
in a way they
can understand
alto
mama
that
that is san pablo
are they looking
for us
get in there
come on
do you think
they saw us
i hope not
do not be too worried
mrs jordan
we are not so far
from the frontier
well
about that village
cant we go there
we could but
im afraid we might
bring them trouble
thank you
are you very tired
cant be far now
cant it
what are you
thinking about
how long we can live
on a bar of chocolate
well have plenty left
for tomorrow
tom why cant we
go to that village
i could go
i mean i dont think
anyone will recognize me
i mean nobody
could recognize me now
i could get food
i can speak enough spanish
i mean why not
because it will be
dangerous that why
oh tom
oh you wont
ever listen
well im sorry
dont
dont what
apologize
i know it went all wrong
after that party
it seems
so long ago
no tom no
im sorry but i really
dont feel like it
i thought it might
be comforting
itll be more comforting
if you could find us
some food and water
or even a bed
oh lord
im hungry
all right then
let go to sleep
let just go to sleep
oh no
oh no i just
want some food
oh just some food
you bloody
little fool
mr jordan
mr jordan
please
i must rest
i remember once when
my son was a little boy
i took him
to a fiesta
hundreds of indians
came to town
galloping on horses
and my little boy
let go off my hand
and ran out among
those great hooves
i called him to return
but he would not come
i was sure
he would be killed
the horses passed
and there was my little boy
alive and well
i ran over to him
and i struck him hard
it was out
of great relief and love
but my little boy
could not understand that
it gonna rain
of course
what do you mean
of course
this is the temple of the god
of rain and fertility
we shall have
a feast in his honor
mexican enchilada
roast beef
with yorkshire pudding
mine
where mine
youre busy eating it
he eating
my chocolate
he eating my chocolate
that mean
that disgusting
that little piece of chocolate
and now he eating it
ive been thinking
about it all day
that little piece of chocolate
and now he eating it
please
mrs jordan
darling
this is your piece
look at the rain
it like england
you remember when
we first arrived in england
and you were expecting to find
a country full of green lawns
and stately homes and tall
titled men in tweed suits
making witty remarks and
eating cucumber sandwiches
hmm
you remember
the first few weeks all we did
was sit in the railway hotel
and watch the rain
pouring down
on pennington station
and not a lord
came near us
im sorry
im so sorry
that all right
i didnt know
what happened
that all right
it was awful
tom
tom
i see a cactus
i found something
to eat
no mrs jordan
you first
oh no no
you eat it first
please
you are always
so kind
are we
anywhere near yet
that is bareya
you would cross
is the frontier
we always used
to argue about it
ill go down when
it gets dark take a look
your husband does not
approve of me mrs jordan
since the matter
of the boy
no he doesnt
he a very pure man
or shall i say
a man of high ideals
tom
is he pure
for him things have to
be either right or wrong
if they are a little mixed
he is disgusted he gets sick
he saw the good
in revolution
but difficult to work
within the cabinet
did you hear
anything
women and prime ministers
have to be a little complicated
to survive
isnt that right
but you know
men like your husband
they are better
than us
it well guarded
but we can do it
now it dark
let spread out in the woods
very thick all around
so weve done it
we saved you
why mr jordan
that i cannot
understand
just a small
private feeling
they are-they are
nice those feelings
but they never
stay private
im a politician
understand
in the end i may do worse
for you than losing your job
or your home
or even your watch
like what
i may confuse you
mr jordan
weve been waiting
for you mr jordan
what did he say
he says now weve found him
that all we wanted
and now we should
let you go
those are not
my orders
what are
your orders
to bring you to the justice
of the people all of you
a nice public trial
in the sports arena
you will be
allowed a trial
can you guess
the verdict
naturally the verdict
is well known
you mean
well be shot
so why the hell
didnt you say so
oh i cant wait
to hear the prosecutor
when
the tumbler due
the what
the track-the transport
to take us back
it waiting
on the main road
were going
to leave now
just a minute
what about my wife
your wife
she been traveling
for 2 days without any food
a peasant might treat
a woman like that
a peasant
yes a stupid
brutal peasant
senora
my name is gomez
my family has a fine tradition
of courtesy to women
all right
so your mother a woman
now ask my wife
if she tired
i was about
to do so
there no need
for a foreigner to remind me
are you tired
senora
im pregnant
if you wish
to stay here the night
we will take turns
to guard you
thank you
yes mr bryant rivera has
been caught where i expected
here at the frontier
to bareya
congratulations and thank you
for letting me know so soon
that a splendid news
for us yes
but not for you
mr bryant
what do you mean
rivera had
two companions
wait till i see
that fool jordan
you will see him
very soon
meanwhile you will
have to wait here
but im so sorry i have
a rather important--
i said here
what made you think
of that story
what
about being pregnant
it true
wake up rivera
what
wake him up and get ready
to make a run for it
i just wanted
to thank you
for being
so kind to my wife
there arent many people
under the circumstance
whod be
so understanding
that all right
how is your wife
is she resting well
oh yes thank you
as well
as can be expected
you mustnt think i dont
understand family matters
im married too
you know
you are
yes
my own wife gave me
a boy just 3 months ago
would you be interested
to see a picture ive got
id love to
ive got it here
in my wallet
wife and baby
together
where is it
oh here it is
he has a fine
loud voice
we believe he been
destined for the opera
basso profondo
ah good
the cup that cheers no
tell me you find our
people good workers
first rate of course
we give them plenty
of responsibility
but we make absolutely
no distinction
between the british
and the
natives
well of course we dont
actually call them that
why not we call you
extranos outsiders
and which
of the natives
would you trust most
to run the plantation
let me see
well ive got
a lot of time
for my assistant
rafael trujo
sometimes i think
he knows more
about the job
than i do myself
rafael trujo
good
i must make
a note of that name
im afraid youre
going to find england
rather cold
after this mr bryant
one must be aware
of sudden change of climate
theyve escaped
no doubt they would have
crossed the frontier by now
jordan killed
one of my men
as his chief
im holding you responsible
but you cant do that
im a british subject
whoever you are
you can be tried as
an accessory to a murder
but how do you know
it jordan
it might be rivera
rivera
that failed man
rivera
mr bryant
please sit down
i might give you
and napier one last chance
please
i want evidence from jordan
that rivera killed my man
i want it clear
do you understand
no doubts about it
i want the world to know
that the poor old refugee
is a common criminal
stabs a young man in the dark
tries to kill a child
that poor child
a terrible story mr bryant
then theyll have
to send him back
no one is going
to protest
or shed tears
in the sports arena
yes you are going to talk
to jordan mr bryant
in that way you might save
your precious plantations
so you are going
on a short journey
youll be ready
in half an hour
and vidal here
will keep you company
remember accidents can
happen even in bareya
tom
well he in a room
just below us
the doctor
on his way
oh good
gosh i hope he going
to be all right
aw
well he safe anyway
yes
but we cant keep him
with us forever can we
no that true
ooh
something got to be
done about this hair
when we get home
would you like it
if i suddenly went blond
when we get home
i got to find a job
something tells me
im not exactly going to get
a letter of congratulations
at napier
another job bitched up is
that what you were gonna say
no
i wasnt going
to say that
turn it off
for god sake
what is it
oh god
what is it
what is it darling
tell me
oh tom
tom
the best
singer the opera
that what he said
he wanted his son to be
showed me a picture
oh
oh
it all over tom
it all over now
oh tom
where the president
no say
where have they
moved him to
no say senor
where is president rivera
he was taken away
in an ambulance
to santa maria hospital
oh
when my wife calls down
tell her ive gone there
yes of course sir
thank you
congratulations on
your journey mr jordan
i hope you wont find
it was a waste of time
just a minute
where are you
taking him
were trying
to treat him
this is a hospital
havent you noticed
not a place for
a political demonstration
are you
another reporter
no i just
brought him here
now just leave him
to us will you
just leave him to us
he was a great man
mr jordan
what did you say
he was a great man
rivera
i never really knew
not that
it will help him
what do you mean
it only a very short flight
from here to tribulacion
but they cant send him back
he is a political refugee
a great embarrassment
to the president of bareya
now mr jordan i represent
news international
perhaps you
would be so kind--
oh jordan
good to see you again
come sit down
there something i want
to talk to you about
you know youve got us
into a pretty bad jab
but quite frankly and
speaking off the record
i must say i feel the sneaky
sort of admiration
i mean i might well
have done the same thing
if i found you dumped
on my doorstep
you might
what do you want
oh it just this
it very simple
keep the local boys happy
and it would help if youd
sign to correct the record
it a mere formality
ah the beautiful
mrs jordan
he wants us
to correct the record
what does it say
oh it just a formality
to save the government face
i suggest we get
this over and go
and have a good lunch
on the company
you must have forgotten
what a good steak looks like
rivera was armed
with a knife
and we clearly saw him approach
lieutenant gomez and kill him
rivera was asleep
look jordan
all they want you
to do is to say
that he did it
simply to clear us
no
so they can
get him back
listen to me
do be sensible
you know bryant
i used to think that
you were just a bowtie
and a big suit
and a fat smile
put on by the wind
but you are worse
you are much worse
why dont you go away
go home
stop trying to get us
to lie about things
that you wouldnt
even understand
mrs jordan
will you help us
youve got
the future to think of
what are you going to do
let him go through the world
throwing away
every job he ever gets
cant you
make him see sense
tom
hed like to see you now
mr jordan and your wife
well
mr jordan
im here
you are both safe
quite safe
remarkable woman
why did you do it
i dont know
honestly
i dont know
because i hate
violence i suppose
because i cant stand the
thought of men getting killed
and now
to save you i
i killed a man
at last you understand
please
please forgive me
for teaching you this
they wont get you back
no
i dont think so

emotionless face and
the blackest eyes

desperate measures

studies have proven that
all teenagers at some point

avoided this whole thing
if you woulda simply scored
some of your mom booze

responsible dont talk to me
about responsible mom
i just need this one thing
mom i am not responsible for you
that it that enough
i cant take it mom
he dead
michael myers is dead
what do you want me to say
that it over
that we should try to get on with
some attempt at a happy existence mom
because all the shit that going on
in your head is leakin out on me
and i cant take it anymore
you told me yourself
you watched him burn
i didnt e-exactly stay to see his ashes john
mom 20 years
twenty years
dont you think he would
have shown up by now
what he waitin for huh
okay mom i cant live

what does that mean john
if you want to stay handcuffed

yes
bring us a dream
give him a pair of eyes with a
ronny
mom let me
where the hell is he
ronny
hey ronny
where the hell were you
norma told me to walk the perimeter
and where were you
when these two got out
eyes up ronny
psycho
janice
dont send down any more all right
i gotta go to class
janice
oh uh
shh the best part
oh
do i get points or what
huh
you score yeah yeah
hmm well it just
occurred to me today
that ive never
celebrated halloween before
and why is that
oh weve got a psychotic
serial killer in the family who
loves to butcher people
on halloween and
i just thought it
in bad taste to
celebrate
so why now
mm because there comes a point in your
life where you have to concentrate
on what right about it
really
and you
are a sterling example
of what right
and tonight you get
my full concentration
im honored
very good point aj
so what could victor have done
to save elizabeth
anybody at all
come on people
did anybody read the book
guys
it frahnk-en-steen
you could have watched the movie
molly please
do you have any thoughts
on victor and elizabeth
well uh
um
well i think that victor should have
confronted the monster sooner
i mea he completely responsible
for elizabeth death
he was he was so paralyzed by fear
that he never did anything
it-it took death
for the guy to get a clue
and why do you think he was
finally able to confront his monster
i think that victor had reached
a point in his life where he
had nothing left to lose
i mean the monster saw to that
by killing off everybody that he loved
victor finally had to face it
it was about redemption
it was his fate
okay everybody um
have a good time
john
what
it a permission slip
bus leaves in 45 minutes
go pack quick
ma i dont have to go
go just go have fun

hey
hey honey
im sorry that ive been such an ass
about the whole wedding thing
i dont know what the matter with me
i know it important to you
i know
and you know what
i do want to start a family
and i swear that i wont be so uptight
from now on
that alone should be worth
waking up for right
for those of you who dont know
trey mccoy was attacked a few days ago
and is recovering in hospital
ive spoken to his dad
and he wants you all to know how much
he and his family greatly appreciate
the support
theyve received from all of you
i would ask that you continue
to keep trey in your prayers and thoughts
while he in recovery
we will begin today service with a prayer
father we ask that we may find comfort
in every sorrow and may see
our way through darkness into light
sin is the ruin and misery
of the human soul
it is destructive in its nature
and god has declared
through many scriptures
that he will punish the unrepentant sinner
and they should be cast down
into the fires of hell
because they not only hate god
they shame him and they do not fear him
god is love
and religion is the law of love
when a soul
becomes filled with the love of god
with a desire for all that is good
it become possessed
of a new hold on existence
there are dark clouds of god wrath
hanging directly over your heads
full of the dreadful storm
and the screaming of thunder
and were it not for god restraining hand
it would immediately burst forth upon you
you are in god hands
and it is uncertain what he will do with you
no situation in life is hopeless
winter has its bright spots
sickness its comforts
and the sharpest affliction some solace
where there is nothing else there is hope
whatever is good is given to all
the sun shines for all
let us not forget what god explicitly tells us
and that is to love thy neighbor as thyself
sinners you have despised
the mighty power of god
consider the danger that you are in
it is a great furnace
a wide and bottomless pit
full of fire and brimstone
that you are held over
trust in the good of mankind
and in the beauty of god
the wrath of god
acceptance
abomination
god is love
and he will punish you
trey trey trey

fags
what are you afraid of that it contagious
i said get out man
dont you want more of us to beat to death
you stay away from me
youre not gonna get away with it
now im warning you
or what
you leave me alone
let me ask you a question
did god tell you to do it huh
did it make you feel powerful
does your god approve of murder
let me ask you a
question did god tell you to do it huh
did it make you feel powerful
does your god approve of murder
what do you think
nothing physical linking boyd
there has to be something
besides the strong circumstantial evidence
yeah i think youre missing
the obvious here fisher
mr levinson
yes
sergeant esposito dallas homicide
is there any news
may i come in
i dont understand why
this is taking so long
it seems like you guys
are dragging your feet
is that so
i noticed in the original report
that you and mr mccoy had an argument
just before the incident
what are you talking about
i just wanna know what happened
we had a disagreement
what about
why does that matter
did you two fight a lot
no
what do all these questions have to do
with my next door neighbor
well your neighbor tells me he saw
you and mr mccoy fight quite a bit
and you believe him
he also tells me youve been harassing him
he killed my partner
he and two other people
say he couldnt have
theyre lying
well why would a respected pastor
a man of god lie to the police
to protect his son
a word of advice stay away from chris boyd
he been arrested for gay-bashing
for christ sake
all i know is what the evidence tells me
and your fingerprints were the only ones
on that bat
i explained that
mr levinson you want to tell me
about the life insurance policy
we both had one on each other
did you kill your boyfriend
this isnt happening
it a simple question
get out of my house
and gave us the day and the night
and god made the sky above
and god made the water below
where chris boyd
check the activity room
youre interrupting a meeting
what did you tell them
back off
youre a liar
back off
yes we need help
what going on here
kathleen call stella
where you taking him and why
well well well ms slansky
nice to see you again kathleen
mr esposito
committing another act of justice i see
now i figured id run into you
again eventually
now you stay on the right side
of the law this time
otherwise ill be taking you down too
your boy here been arrested for assault
you leave him alone you mother
she been coaching you son
what are you doing
sit down
i dont want to sit
close the door and sit down
you could have told me
that you were questioning robbie levinson
as a suspect
when youve been doing this as long as
i have
he didnt do it
are you familiar with this case
you mean my case yeah im familiar with it
well then you know that his fingerprints
are all over the murder weapon
which just happened to belong to the victim
he was covered in the victim blood
and to top it all off he about to collect
half a million dollars in life insurance
i mean what am i missing here
the whole goddamn story and chris boyd
oh yes right chris boyd is lying
show me the proof
kathleen slansky statement
oh come on
about that
you do me a favor
you ask that old broad about her husband
her dead husband
i mean look at the facts fisher
you cannot just ignore boyd past
oh all too convenient for levinson
wouldnt you think
just because a man has had run-ins
with homos
homosexuals doesnt mean he a killer
yeah well neither does being a homo
look it looks like
an open and shut case to me
ive already talked to the da about
making a case
you did what
you are not going to just shut me out of this
this is homicide fisher
stick to something you can handle
robbie what is wrong with you
theyre putting a restraining order
out on me
what
yeah to stay away from him
i should have seen this coming
this isnt like you
hey promise me
you wont do something like this again
he lying to the police
robbie
hey you should get some rest

what with all the stories in the paper
and the things people are saying
i mean you can imagine the embarrassment
this is causing our church
get out of my house
mrs mccoy you need to know
that christopher would never
ever do something like this
my son is a
he a decent kind god-fearing young man
oh really
my son is dead
i know
i know what you must be going through
tell you what
christopher has done
some pretty foolish things in his life
especially when he was a little boy
by god grace
he always been able to stay on track
but every time he would get into trouble
i couldnt help but feel that somehow
i had failed as a mother
i really do hope that
you dont blame yourself
for the choices your son made
excuse me choices
well you know what i mean
by living his life the way he did
surely you understand that he was a target
get out
get out
sit down christopher
you live your life in spite of me boy

what were you doing in that evil place
nothing
what were you doing in there son
you tell me
that filthy sinning faggot
came on to me
and i told him to get out of my face
and he wouldnt leave me alone
and he wouldnt listen to me
and it was disgusting
what were you doing in there
in the first place
i got lost
you liar
now how about this time this time
and the time before that
and the time before that
youll not humiliate me any longer
now you will not betray god
what have i done to deserve
such defiance from you son
i didnt do anything wrong
i told him he was gonna go to hell
i told him to read the bible
it was those fags that live next door
wasnt it those boys over there
huh
i seen you with them
they tried to recruit you
is that what happened
you wouldnt do that on your own

christopher
chris
is that you i thought i heard you come in
is something wrong
why do you put up with him
what are you talking about
you shouldve gotten out
when you had the chance
chris arent you staying for supper
he that is joined unto the lord
is one spirit
flee fornication
every sin that a man doeth
is without the body
but he that commits fornication
sins against his own body
know ye not that your body is the temple
of the holy ghost which is in you
what shall we say then
shall we continue in sin
that grace may abound god forbid
for in that he died
he died unto sin once
but in that he lives
he lives unto god
let not sin therefore reign
in your mortal body
that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof
that the body of sin might be destroyed
and we should not serve sin
for he that is dead
is freed from sin
in the name
of god it has got to stop
and if somebody doesnt do something
this plague is going to infest
the entire country
come back to god son
youre sick
come back to god son
christopher

-----NewMovie-----
gigi a girl will never forget
the first boy she likes
even if things dont quite work out
why did you do that
because you smell like dog poo
youre so stupid just like dog poo
youre made out of poo
gigi but usually someone is there
to offer words of wisdom
made
of
dog
poo
honey
do you know why that little boy
did those things and said those things
it because he likes you
gigi
and there it is
that the beginning of our problem
that little boy is doing those terrible things
because he got a crush on you
gigi
do you know what this means
were all encouraged

to believe that if a guy
acts like a total jerk
that means he likes you
here the problem
he likes you too much
youre too pretty and too awesome

he cant handle it
that phi delt so obviously liked you
im sure he just lost your number
he not asking you out because he
intimidated by your professional success
speaking in japanese
trust me it because he just
getting out of a serious relationship
trust me it because he never had
a serious relationship
speaking in foreign language
gigi
why do we say this stuff to each other
is it possible that it because
were too scared
and it too hard to say

yeah but im not
one of those cheesy ones

who get married are not to be trusted
you are so weird
theyre not you know why
because if you are so legitimately happy
honestly
you wouldnt feel the need
to make a big show out of it
you wouldnt have to broadcast it
they do it because theyre insecure
and they think getting married
what theyre supposed to be doing
so theyre lying to themselves
and to other people
seriously
think about you and your friends
okay
these women you have
great relationships with
youre close to them
some of them youve known for years
but you dont feel the need
to write a $45 check to the state
of maryland for a friendship certificate
yeah no i get that
right
why should it be any different
you know with me and you
were very happy i love you
im committed to you
we have a great life you know
yes youre right
why cant we just be happy
youre right
im gonna get you some more tea
okay
kids shouting

janine
you want coffee
i got you 2 percent
thanks
this is all your fault
what why
you set us up
no you asked me if i know any guys
and i gave conor your phone number
that not a setup
when i do a setup
i weigh the pros and cons
i do my due diligence
all i know about conor
is that he sold us this house
seriously stop
he said he always hangs out after work
at the city supper club
maybe i should do a little drive-by
please dont
hell call
amber
okay i have a question
whyd they even invent caller id
it like who is this service helping
i mean for centuries
okay well maybe not centuries
but for like a lot and lot of years
people have been answering their phone
not knowing who it is
and as far as i can tell
no one died from that
and it like if the police wanna know
who placed a call they could trace it
i mean what am i the police
this constant obsession with needing
to know who calling all the time
it like so gross
like you pick up the phone
you find out who it is then you know
it like
look all im saying
if a guy doesnt call me
i would like to reserve the right
to call him at 5-minute intervals
until he picks up
but if he looks down
and sees my numbers
he gonna think
im some kind of psycho or something
which im not
obviously
shower running
human league dont you
want me plays on phone
hello

gigi he ordered more drinks for us
when the waitress came
he remembered exactly what i wanted
he initiated the hug
he said it was nice meeting me
so wait this was at the end of the date
or the beginning of the date
end why does it matter
yeah nice meeting you at the beginning
of the date that normal
nice meeting you
at the end of the date
it could be a blowoff
maybe it was at the beginning
okay that fine he gonna call
or maybe it was at the end
or maybe it was just nice to meet me
beth
help
hi this is torture
how am i supposed to come up
with something pithy and dynamic
to say about cinnamon blends
it hard to focus on nutmeg
when the guy who might be
the guy of my dreams
refuses to call me
after my first date with neil
i called him
there are no rules anymore
and i mean why should you
have to wait for him to get off his ass
it ringing
that pretty standard
hey youve reached conor
yes voicemail
leave a message ill get back to you
notes
hey conor it gigi
i just thought i hadnt heard from you
and how stupid is it that a gal has
to wait for a guy call anyway right
mouthing
what does that say what that say
because were all equal right
more than equal
more women are accepted
into law school now than men
and i mean i dont know
if you saw that dateline
but women practically
have penises now right so
call me
oh this is gigi call me
dont worry he totally gonna call
sighs

how can there not be a dial tone
how can there not be a dial tone
no dial tone come here dial tone
woman on phone
gigi are you there
hello gigi
mom is that you
yes
i cant talk now ill call you back
wait i need you to
dial tone
hi it janine leave a message
hi janine it me
conor never called
so im on the precipice of staging
a casual run-in at the city supper club
pick up if you wanna stop me
all right im interpreting your silence
as tacit compliance bye
bartender what up girl
hey
how are you
good
knock knock
hey
so
here we are same shift again
i know i make the schedule remember
well i figured it was no coincidence
i had
a good time the other night
yeah
it amazing where 0 shots
of patrón will get you
laughs
so i was thinking
after work we could
you know
look kelli ann what happened
between us the other night was fun
it was definitely fun
but were way understaffed tonight
i even have to man the bar
so that why i scheduled you
to work
so
are we good
nope were good
okay
hey oh kelli ann
hey babe could you get the door
thanks
uptempo music playing
kelli ann
hi are you joining us for dinner or
im meeting someone a guy
kelli ann why

nothing sorry for dinner
ill wait at the bar
that a great idea
what can i get you
oh no im meeting someone
oh yeah what you got a hot date
i dont know if youd call it hot
this guy conor and i
have only been out one time
wait wait wait conor barry
yeah
conor not coming in tonight
thanks a lot
did he forget he was
supposed to meet you here
oh see when i said meeting someone
i guess it was kind of a broad term
a wide interpretation
of the word meeting
right you know what ill call him
oh no i mean just totally unnecessary
okay
i just was actually in the area
and so i just figured id swing by
and see if he was around
because i had to return his pen
had to return this pen he left this
and i just thought i should really return it
before he you know freaks out
yeah okay ill get it to him
thanks
wilson ward dds
adult child and geriatric dentistry
look im not going to judge what may
or may not be important to someone
yeah that not even
his dentist though
oh really who is
my dad
oh
im gigi i went out
with conor last week
and i just
i thought if i just ran into him
i dont know im gonna go
wait
wait just
hang out for a second
let me buy you a drink
one drink okay
give me two seconds ill be right back
alex look you seem like a cool girl
so im just gonna be honest with you
conor never gonna call you
oh really how do you know
because im a guy
and it just how we do it
he said it was nice meeting me
i dont care if he said
you were his favorite female
since his mommy
and joanie cunningham
over a week went by okay gigi
and he didnt call you
but maybe he did call
and i didnt get the message
or maybe he lost my number
or he out of town
or got hit by a cab or his grandma died
or he didnt call because
he has no interest in seeing you again
yeah but my friend terri once went
out with a guy who never called
she totally wrote him off
over a year goes by
right
she ran into him
and it ended up that
your friend terri an idiot
she also the exception
by the way
the rare exception
okay okay
but what if im the exception
no youre not youre not at all
in fact youre the rule
and the rule is this if a guy doesnt
call you he doesnt wanna call you
really
yeah
always
yeah always
look i know what blowing off
a woman looks like okay
i do it early i do it often
so trust me when i say if a guy
is treating you like he doesnt give a shit
he genuinely doesnt give a shit
no exceptions
thank you
given me a lot to think about
gigi morning morning
man excuse me
hi
hi
everything okay
oh i was up all night
please say you were working
on the nutmeg copy
sure it basically done
i have to tell you something important
janine
sweetie what going on with your hair
yeah come here before people
see you have a mini muffin in your hair
okay
so
thank you i think i figured it out
remember that notary public
who cheated on me
then anastasia told me her boyfriend
cheated on her at the beginning
but then he changed and now
theyre married and crazy in love
i thought that guy was a process server
no notary
anyway my point is
anastasia the exception not the rule
we have to stop listening
to these stories
the rule is that guys who cheat on you
dont care about you much
okay
okay so exhibit a
chad the drummer who lived
in a storage space
he only used me for rides and yet
i continued to stalk him for most of 998
and then oh there was don
who broke up with me every friday
so that he could have his weekends free
i was delusional about that relationship
id refer to him as my husband
to my dental hygienist
and all of my friends
used to tell me stories
about how things might work out
with these dipshits
because they knew someone
who dated a dipshit like mine
and that girl ended up getting married
but that the exception
were not the exception were the rule
okay let me just see if i understand
so what youre saying is
if i hear a story about a girl
who been with a guy for 3 years
and he finally married her
that the exception
yes
but the rule are guys like neil
who are with girls like me
for seven years and arent married
theyre never getting married
no
no
no no no no no no
no
it not what she meant in that
no it got nothing to do with you
i absolutely was not talking about you
these are specific relationship situations
i was talking about myself specifically
gigi
just me specifically you know
this guy is like impossible
not to like you know
he flirting with me pretty heavily
outside of the handy mart
and you know everything just kind
of lines up it really magical
and then he tells me that he married
which of course
i should be pissed about right
but i just cant stop thinking about him
but he married
i know i realize that
i dont know what wrong with me
what wrong with me
okay
i know this guy
he works in my dad printing business
and he was married for 5 years
to a nice lady
and one night he meets this woman
at some church event
and he tells my dad that he never
felt anything like it before
that he had finally met the one
so he divorced his wife
and he been with this other woman
for 22 years
and theyre insanely happy
i mean what if you meet
the love of your life
but you already married someone else
are you supposed to
let them pass you by
youre right okay
im gonna call him
okay
ben hello
hey ben this is anna marks
hey anna what up
nothing i was just
i was taking you up on your offer
i know you said you had a couple
of contacts you thought could help me

take care though bye
hey
hey
im psyched you called

kind of given up on you
when you didnt call me back
i was just thinking about you

why is it the painting
you know i know it looks
kind of like a deflated boob here

it gonna be depressing
should i take it down
no i want you
to stop doing anything nice
this feels like a trick
no
no
no i just i just need you
to stop being nice to me
unless youre gonna marry me after
chuckles
is that funny
do you think that funny
no i guess it not funny
see you cant keep being nice to me
and i cant keep pretending
that this is something that it not
weve been together
for over seven years
you know me you know who i am
you either wanna marry me
or you dont
or there the possibility
that i mean it when i say
i dont believe in marriage
bullshit
come on it bullshit for every woman
that has been told by some man
that he doesnt believe in marriage
and then six months later he married
to some 24-year-old that he met at a gym
it just it bullshit
where is this coming from
from the place ive been hiding
from you for about five years
okay
five years because i havent wanted
to seem demanding
and i havent wanted
to seem clingy or psycho
or whatever
so i havent asked you
but i
i have to
i mean
are you ever gonna marry me
oh i cant do this anymore
angela i used to think that i had
never been dumped
yeah then we started comparing notes
then we realized weve both been dumped
by every man weve ever been with
every one
yeah
but they do it so skillfully
mm-hm
they just so sneaky
that you think it was your idea
yeah youre sitting back
and youre like
oh yeah this my idea
but wait a second why am i alone
why am i unhappy
why have i gained 20 pounds
they jedi mind-trick you
yes they do
so they do a soft pass
yeah
they got little lines they like to tell you
like i dont wanna stand in your way
or youre perfect
it just i have to work on myself
right im just thinking
of your happiness
oh i dont deserve you
that my favorite one
you know the other one i like
i am so jealous of the guy
who gets to marry you
well that could have been you
yeah
that what i was leaning towards
yeah and the second you hear that
run to the store get yourself some ribs
and some ice cream
because you have been dumped
hey anna it ben
listen i know it been a while
since you called
it just it took me by surprise
but i did offer to help you
with your career
and i dont see why
i cant do that right
so why dont you give me a call

come by the office or something

you marry her and youre an asshole

ken
so enjoy the crab
and that yellow stuff is not hot mustard
it the crab hepatopancreas
bethie
your cousin jay
has always been a jackass
i know
and somehow even he married
ken chuckles
oh honey look
back when everyone
was just going to camp at the y
you borrowed my new york times
found some arts camp
in the berkshires
wrote away for information
and got accepted on your own
you never did things like everyone else
why not
because that you
that why youre my favorite daughter
youre not supposed to say that
i dont give a shit
im retired ill say what i want to
ill say it to the whole room if you want
wait wait wait come here stop
ken
it true though
hey
what are you doing
waiting for you
come on
sorry im late
no it okay
i like a little time before a blind date
prepare myself mentally remind myself
not to tell the story about my molars
gigi he not coming
but you can tell me the story
about the molars id love to hear it
hey
how could he already not like me
i screwed up i told bill it was thursday
not tuesday it my fault
hi are you good
can i get a jameson on the rocks
sure
gigi awesome im stuck with a guy who
cant distinguish tuesday from thursday
meanwhile this girl she probably
meeting her soul mate as we speak
this one right here
mm-hm
oh god no
how do you know
the guy working the tom cruise thing
she interested he clearly not
you cannot tell from a cursory glance
that he not into her
actually i can
i see this stuff going on every night
watch this she going on
about her macrobiotic diet
he thinking
dear christ get me out of here
and look how fortuitous
drinks spill which is perfect for him
because now
he can move on to the girl
with the shoulder tattoo
man you have a gift
now check out droopy dog
on the other side
he gonna buy her drinks all night and
she still gonna insist there no spark
maybe there not you need a spark
oh the spark thing is bullshit
really
bullshit
enlighten me
guys invented the spark
so they could not call and treat you
kind of badly and keep you guessing
then convince you that that anxiety
and fear that just develops naturally
was actually just a spark
and you guys all buy it
you eat it up and you love it
you love it because you feed off
that drama you all love that drama
i dont
so you never wait until the last minute
on a deadline or a phone bill
because secretly you love the drama
of not knowing whether or not
youre gonna make it
maybe
and let me guess
when you were stalking conor
the other night
were you obsessing
about him calling
constantly pacing back and forth
staring at your phone for days
even though the date
was just kind of mediocre
gigi laughs
okay yeah
because you all thrive on the drama
thank you
look you gotta be more like me
if a girl likes me great
but if not there are plenty more
out there like her you know
with smaller pores and bigger implants
that beautiful
i know
why are you sharing all of this inside
dating information with me again
i dont know i like you
you do
well yeah okay dont start doodling
my name on your binder okay
i just mean i mean i like you
the way i like basset hounds
something pathetic about them
you just wanna cheer them up
again with the sensitivity
to sensitivity
hammering
it looks good
javier
yeah
janine
yeah
he does good work
yeah he does
janine
very nice
very nice
javier
yeah
javier
if i asked you an honest question
do you think you could
give me an honest answer
i think so
good good
because i think some of your guys
might be smoking
javier
is that the question
yes
seemed like a statement
the question part implied
i really didnt hear it in the inflection
javier
have you guys been smoking
or not
no maam my guys they dont smoke
on the job site theyre good guys
are you sure your guys havent been
sneaking around here
and smoking
and lying to me
and smoking
im pretty sure
i need you to be honest with me javier
because i cant have someone
lying to me
to my face under my roof
on my time
that a lot of prepositions
i mean there no reason
for that kind of dishonesty is there
i mean we made promises to each other
i mean we have a contract
that like making promises isnt it
maybe i should get back to work
oh yeah right yeah
that great yeah
javier
yeah
were good right you and me
oh yeah yeah were good
oh good
okay that great
yeah he did great work
hey
welcome everybody
thanks for coming im conor
sign in when you get a second
make yourselves at home
we got some cookies over here
some cold beverages help yourself
conor you are the liza minnelli
of real estate
i know your friend mary a genius
i know she so great
well i gotta go
so i guess ill see you later
what you got a class or
yeah no no just something
stuff i gotta do
conor okay well
ill see you okay bye
okay
okay bye
see you later
conor all right call me
what
she holding out on you isnt she
not quite sure i get your meaning
it obvious she wont sleep with you
it written all over your puppy-dog face
it killing me literally im dying
here have a cookie
no im cool
i dont know what she doing
i cannot read her signals
we used to sleep together all the time
that not true
i dont know why i said that
it wasnt all the time but it happened
i know im not just making this up
and then out of nowhere it just stops
but she still calls
she wants a massage
she leaves cute messages
but it not going anywhere
what is she doing
honestly we may not
have the best insight
gay signals have nothing
to do with straight signals
he right
the signals are totally different
like here
here i wanna sleep with you
one two three
that it three seconds or more it on
and here
i dont wanna sleep with you
one two
nope thanks for playing move along
it that simple
youre right that didnt help me at all
all right well i can tell you this
gay or straight youre not gonna
get anywhere by being inactive
she likes you maybe she just wants you
to be a man and do something
hit me up with an oatmeal raisin
will you
thanks
here you go
trent if a girl into you
she sleeping with you
if after a month
or two months at the very outside
she not sleeping with you
she doesnt like you
the trick is to spot this girl early
dont wanna waste the one to seven weeks
waiting to find out it never gonna happen
so ive come up with some signs
about how to spot this girl
a girl will never sleep with you
if she calls you cuddly
or dependable
if she pops a zit in front of you
if her name is amber or christine
if she takes a dump in your bathroom
or she takes home leftovers
on dates one two or three
i know it not scientific
but im just saying
you were warned
wait stop
what
ben
shit
what
i am so into you
seriously ive never felt like this before
i have to actively stop my brain
from thinking about you
like all the time
why stop
because i dont do stuff like this
stuff like what
like sleep with women
that arent my wife
first of all i am not women
im just one
and second of all
oh i didnt have a second of all
i was hoping second of all
would make me feel better
second of all
i cant stop thinking about you either
anna laughs
he totally leaving his wife for me
that crazy
that crazy we hardly know each other
i dont know i mean look at becca
you know my sister friend
one guy waits on her at bennigan
and by the end of the meal
they both knew they had found the one
youre right youre totally right
i mean it could happen right
not for me
what about texter
texter has yet to make verbal contact
i mean this guy couldve had surgery
leaving him without a voice box
breathing through a stoma
and i would never know because
ive never actually heard his voice
well i doubt he has a stoma
mary
that not the point i cant text
you know im not charming via text
anna
maybe you should just stop texting
but it not just texting it e-mail
it voicemail it snail mail
that regular mail
whatever none of it working
i had this guy leave me a voicemail
at work so i called him at home
and then he e-mailed me to my blackberry
and so i texted to his cell
then he e-mailed me to my home account
and the whole thing just got out of control
and i miss the days where you had one
phone number and one answering machine
and that one answering machine
housed one cassette tape
and that one cassette tape either
had a message from the guy or it didnt
and now you have to go around
checking all these different portals
just to get rejected
by seven different technologies
it exhausting
what about that myspace guy
jude i like him
good
yeah i felt like we connected
great
what if she wants you to kiss her
well then i guess
im just gonna have to kiss her
amanda jones is no minor leaguer
wholl be swept off her feet
at the touch of your amateur lips
phone rings
this babe has plenty of battle scars
hello
oh hey youre home
where am i supposed to be
out maybe it saturday night
you wont let me go out with guys
who dont like me it kind of limiting
right listen i was just gonna
leave a message
im having a party next weekend
you should come
oh i dont know wont conor be there
might be kind of awkward
he at a real-estate conference in dc
but therell be a lot of single guys
so there will be plenty of chances
for me to be awkward
dont worry ill be there
ill talk you through it
plates shattering
okay gotta go
someone just dropped like 84000 plates
maybe ill see you there
youre busy i shouldnt have called

i thought mary stuart masterson

go on a date with amanda jones

so amanda jones is conor
i guess at first now men in general
but that not the point
the point is he into me
i knew there had to be some reason why
he was spending that time with you
i know it so obvious now
there are so many signs
signs love signs you gotta
tell me about the signs i love signs
first they were small at first when i
called he said good to hear from you
totally good sign
right
and then the next time i called
he was with a woman
but he took the call
and we talked for a while
you know it was a woman
called her babe
okay a guy doesnt leave a woman
to go talk to another woman unless he
and it gets more obvious
i mean please there was no guy
he was gonna fix me up with
the fix-up was him
no
yes he shows up
without this fictitious bill character
the two of us basically have a date
and then he calls and invites me
to a party at his place
janine

girl bye
gigi bye
hey thanks for staying
and helping me clean up
i really gotta go to bed though
is that an invitation
what
gigi laughs
oh god that was cheesy
oh im not good at this
what
alex
hey
oh yes i knew it
the best relationships
grow out of friendships
wait wait wait gigi
wait wait wait
what
now you and i are in a relationship
well id say if were not
at relationship station-ship
were at least on the track
and why exactly would you think that
because of the signs
really like what
like it was good to hear from me
and you talked to me
even when you were with a girl
and i felt something
oh man
what are you talking about
gigi what have i been saying
since i met you
if a guy wants to date you he will make
it happen okay he will ask you out
did i ask you out
no
why would you do this
oh shit
why do women do this
build up this stuff in their minds
take each little thing a guy does
and then twist it into something else
it insane
id rather be like that than be like you
excuse me
what is that supposed to mean
i may dissect each little thing
and put myself out there too much
but at least that means i still care
oh you think youve won
because women are expendable to you
you may not get hurt
or make an ass of yourself that way
but you dont fall in love
that way either
you have not won
youre alone alex
i may do a lot of stupid shit
but i know im a lot closer
to finding someone than you are
beth
do you want anything else
yeah less of the cardboard crap
and more regular people food
well that cardboard crap
is what we call whole-wheat toast
well maybe you could just fry me up
a couple of sausage links
people who have just had a heart attack
are generally not advised
to have animal fat that been stuffed
into a synthetic casing
chuckles
van morrison i got a woman
playing on record
steven hey beth grab me a beer
when you get to the kitchen okay
and a little plate of cold cuts
if there are any left

to hang on to this vinyl
my collection could use a lot of these

and our new brother would like to co-opt
dad property before he even dead
laura also your husband would
really like another beer
to go with his fifth consecutive hour
of the golf network
are you okay
crying
dont worry honey dad gonna be fine
gigi do you know who it is
no
doesnt matter
so are you gonna leave him
gigi he my husband

who didnt call me back

he didnt wait to get caught
which takes courage you know
im sorry i didnt mean that
i didnt mean it
i know that alex wasnt just some guy
oh it okay
it my fault you know
what
oh i just think i need to take responsibility
for my share in the whole
mess you know
i forced him into getting married
you know he wasnt ready
janine this isnt your fault
no it is it is ive changed
i was
fun you know
i was fun when we first met
youre still fun
sighs
we dont have sex anymore
lots of couples go through lulls
no i mean
we never have sex
janine crying
i mean realistically
what do i expect him to do you know
i dont think that really
god this tile is too small
i have to tell javier
what
this tile is too small
i gotta go i have to take a personal day
if anyone asks
mariel
well my first husband was unimpressive
i found him in bed
with his big-breasted secretary
when i came home early
from the maldives
it was just so unoriginal
made me feel sorry for him
my second husband
was a pinch more creative
cheated on me with my sister
but made me believe that i was insane
for being suspicious
so at least some mind games
some intrigue
but my last husband he was a gem
he was a veritable master
at covering his tracks
i mean i pored over his phone records
i intercepted his credit-card bills
i had him followed
on numerous occasions
and never found
a single shred of evidence
it wasnt until he died
that i found out about the property
he owned with his austrian mistress
but the real master i have to say is me
three husbands countless boyfriends
i havent been caught yet
anna

i guess we can always just
i cant do any of this
i mean
what youre saying
and what youre offering
is what every girl wants
it what i always wanted
it just
you dont want it with me
okay
i have a question
is there any way we could
dial it back to before
when we were just sleeping together
because i dont know
i felt like that gelled
babe
it was nice meeting you
thank you so much for a lovely evening
you too
good night
knocking on door
you forget something
yeah i did
really what did you forget
this
you came all the way here at 00 at night
to bring me back a promotional pen
yeah
i thought i should just come up with
some really great excuse to get over here
that how it done isnt it
sometimes
look i cant stop thinking about you
it a problem
i drive by your place i call and hang up
im turning into
me
yeah
a wise person once told me
that if a guy wants to be with a girl
he will make it happen no matter what
that true
but when i was hurling my body
onto yours
you did not seem
to want to make it happen
yeah all right
here the thing about that
you were right
ive gotten so used to keeping myself
at a safe distance from all these women
and having the power
that i didnt know what it felt like
when i actually fell
for one of them
i didnt know
look i just went out
with your friend bill and
yeah
he might be just exactly what i need
no drama
he calls he does what he says
i can do that stuff too
but you didnt
and that same wise person told me
that i am the rule
that i have to stop thinking
that every guy will change
that i have to stop thinking that
im the exception
you are my exception
phone rings
conor barry
hi it mary at the blade
im looking at your new ad and i love it
really you dont think the muscle t
is too much
i think the shirt youre wearing now
is probably more you
what you here
im sitting right in front of you
mary laughing
wow this is you mary
it me
im me
should l
please please
okay
talk to you in a minute
see you in a second
okay
hey
hi
how are you
it nice to finally meet you
you too
in person
this is a pleasant surprise
you
what
i dont know not what i expected
my voice doesnt match my face
conor your voice does not match
your face in a good way
in a yeah i mean
that sounded terrible
amazing
i dont know how all this stuff
fit in here before
i know it seems like it just expanded
you are not trying
to get these back in here
you are not getting rid of these pants
we had a deal mister
these are not staying
you can store those horizontally
goodwill wouldnt even take these
they could be pressed
flattened you can
if youre gonna throw them out
at least check the pockets all right
so you dont throw away
some personal items
i love you so much
so much
and i wanna make you happy
i need to make you happy
for me to even have a shot
at being happy
will you marry me
yes of course i will yes
yes
neil
thank god
gigi
girls are taught a lot of stuff growing up
if a guy punches you he likes you
never try to trim your own bangs
and someday you will meet a wonderful guy
and get your very own happy ending
and your commitment to each other
gigi every movie we see
every story were told
implores us to wait for it
the third act twist
the unexpected declaration of love
the exception to the rule
but sometimes were so focused
on finding our happy ending
we dont learn how to read the signs
how to tell the ones who want us
from the ones who dont
the ones who will stay
from the ones who will leave
hi
hi
gigi and maybe this happy ending
doesnt include a wonderful guy
maybe it you
on your own
picking up the pieces and starting over
freeing yourself up
for something better in the future
maybe the happy ending is just
moving on
baby what are you doing it our turn
forget the dip come on come on
man
let go alex
come on alex your turn
ready lol
laugh out loud we won
gigi
or maybe the happy ending is this
knowing that through all the unreturned
phone calls and broken hearts
through all the blunders
and misread signals
through all of the pain
and embarrassment
you never ever gave up hope
neil
now that we are married
beth
were gonna move
gonna move
that one thing were gonna do
another thing were gonna do
is move a little further away from
baltimore
your sisters
janine

good im glad
mouthing

﻿
in the summer of 953
it was announced
that an atomic bomb of foreign origin
had been exploded somewhere
outside of the united states
shortly thereafter it was indicated
that this atomic reaction
according to scientific reports
had originated in a remote area
in north pacific waters
somewhere between the northern tip
of the japanese islands
and the arctic circle
this is the story of that explosion
oh
professor montel
im mccleary of the herald tribune
oh yes how do you do
i understand that youre going
to vienna to address the
central european federation
of advanced scientists
that is correct
i will read a paper on the emission
of neutrons and collision of nuclei
thank you professor
will any of the american atomic
energy commission be present
i doubt it
will you excuse me gentlemen
oui
professor excuse me
there one or two points
id like to get clarified
you will have to excuse me gentlemen
the plane is waiting
who the girl
this is the bbc
with the latest news bulletin
professor montel famous nuclear physicist
and atomic scientist
has vanished while en route
to attend a conference in vienna
professor montel disappearance
is a complete mystery to the police
authoritative sources reveal today
that the former nobel prize winner
is the fifth noted scientist believed
to have vanished behind the iron curtain
professor montel was last seen
at the international airport in vienna
speculation as to the whereabouts
of professor montel continues
ten days have elapsed
since the distinguished scientist vanished
and so far police have been unable
to offer any explanation
authorities are now convinced
that professor montel was not kidnapped
and that his disappearance
was part of a prearranged plan
airport officials in vienna
reveal that the scientist
carried a diplomatic passport
the search for professor montel
continues into the fourth week
it is interesting to note that while the
story has been given front-page space
in newspapers in the united states
and all other parts of the free world
pravda the official mouthpiece
of the soviet union
has as yet failed to take note on it
corporal lee stockwell
right
mr r macdougall
that right
mr franklin meredith
that correct
jones
im afraid youre mistaken
my name macdougall
youre a dead ringer for an officer
i used to know in the submarine service
sorry
mr macdougall
yeah
my name is eddy
your instructions
there is a taxi waiting for you
the driver knows the address
taxi number 63
number 63
okay
this is it
you better wait for me
no i go now
wait a minute what if i need you again
where can i find you
what your name
eddy
mr macdougall
yeah
come in please and follow me
watch your step please
now dont tell me your name is eddy too
eddy is the password
im hokada fujimori commander jones
im very pleased to meet you
thanks for a minute there i thought
this was something out of inner sanctum
youve lost a little weight
im on a diet
ill bet captain taylor
put a little fat on
where is he
im sorry to tell you your friend is dead
dead
his plane crashed returning
from an arctic expedition
no one survived
he never did like to fly
why did he want me to come here
what was the 5000 for
it an advance payment
for a job captain taylor
was certain you would do for us
advance
yes
when do i start
without questions
why talk if taylor lined me up
for the job it must be kosher
some people might not
exactly call it kosher
in here please
gentlemen commander jones
mr mcauliff
how do you do sir
colonel schuman
how are you
mr aylesworth
how do you do
and professor montel
montel the scientist
yes
everybody and his brother
is gunning for you professor
they say you skipped
behind the iron curtain
as you can see only a wooden door
glad youre here
thank you sir
well it quite a layout you got here
what kind of business
are you gentlemen in
the business of investigation
the scientific investigation
of these uninhabited north pacific islands
that lie in neutral waters
between the free world
and the iron curtain
our deductions make us believe
that one of these islands
we dont know which one mr jones
has been prepared as an arsenal
for atomic weapons
your friend captain taylor
volunteered
to undertake a photographic mission
to find out
volunteered
yes
for free
for free
is that when he had the accident
it was no accident
his plane was shot down
this photograph we have just printed
came from the camera
of his salvaged plane
thirty years in the navy
and he gets killed for a picture
for free
each man has his own reason
for living mr jones
and his own price for dying
this was captain taylor price
there nothing there professor
it a washout
i wouldnt be too certain
extend these lines
they could be atomic vault constructions
and over here could also be part
of a concrete runway
look look before we go any further
exactly what country do you men represent
we represent many countries
as private individuals
we are scientists
former statesmen businessmen
all volunteers acting independently
for a common cause
against a common enemy
as private individuals
we can conduct this investigation
on a scientific basis
without violating any neutral waters
and if what we suspect is verified
we can then make our findings public
and what good will that do
dont you think the truth
is worth knowing
dont you believe that factual proof
will establish once and for all
both the identity and the intention
of the aggressor
who knows
but where do i fit into the picture
we want you to command a ship
for an inspection tour of these islands
what kind of a ship
a submarine
we know that four times
during world war i i
you commanded a submarine
reconnaissance patrol
in this very area
as i recall you were extremely
successful in these waters
when you fought my country
this time the enemy is different
mr jones but the waters are the same
you received already $5000
20000 in united states currency
will be deposited to your account
in any bank you elect
to chauffeur professor montel
to this island
and another 25000 bonus
when you bring him back safely
with all the information he seeks
what about the sub
did it volunteer too
one does not pick up a first-class
submarine in the junkyard mr jones
we have salvaged a japanese submarine
what class
i-203
sewer pipe had one on my tail once
for six hours taylor look her over
yes
start getting her refitted
yes
armed
mr jones
the object of this mission
is scientific investigation
not combat
professor
am i in command
that right
then we arm the sub
that is if you want me
to get you back in one piece
did you also salvage a crew
we have picked volunteers
experienced men
there will be two scientists on board
professor montel and his assistant
professor gerard
we arent positive which island it is
but a certain freighter the kiang ching
has been up to this area
several times before
with cargos of concrete and heavy metals
she loading again at tientsin
the last time i tailed a freighter
my price was 650 a month
and i had to buy my own uniforms
all right i want my own key men
men whove served with me before
you name them and well get them
like you got me for cash
if it necessary
as i said before mr jones
each man has his own reason for living
and his own price for dying
i hope for all of us
that it will be a bon voyage
giovane help him with the line
giovane you you carpino
give him a hand with the torpedo
how many hands
you think i got neuman
mr neuman to you
now make sure you give me
the reading on that battery
right skipper
come on come on
bring it on boys
bring it around come on
hey come on now
easy now come on
come on come on all right hold
all right boys
make it fast to the cleats
hey
dont you ever take a bath
shut up
shut up
is that the extent of your vocabulary
whatd you ever give up
the wrestling racket for anyway
i just found out it was phony
that the trouble with these
i say that the trouble
with these phony wrestlers dugboat
they never take a bath
we do too
hey joto hey joto
the after valve wont turn
what
the after valve wont turn
no no the other way
everything backwards no wonder you blokes
lost the war with subs like this
skipper
yeah
that guy welles any good
best engineer out of australia
wish we had wilbur
yeah
with charlie wilbur handling
the engines on the bowfin
there was nothing to worry about
hear he a three-striper now
yeah so i hear
skipper
that number two scopes dont work
what the matter with it
cant get the rust out of it
how bout number one
didnt check it
lift her up holter
the professor topside
wants to see the captain
send him down
he part of the brass behind this setup
now if he looks familiar
dont say anything ill explain later
hello professor welcome aboard sir
captain
well were trying to put
this sewer pipe together
with a little spit and a lot of sweat
i guess well make it all right
captain jones
what the matter
is there something wrong
im sorry to say we cannot permit
one of your crew to make this expedition
what do you mean
they were all handpicked
we cannot trust this one
who
the torpedo man revnik
oh one of the men you picked
i could have told you that all the time
a knothead
did you screen all my men too
very closely including you
okay ill get rid of revnik right away
good
holter i want
she the replacement doc
gentlemen this is professor gerard
my assistant and my right arm
hiya
denise this is captain jones
captain jones
glad to know you professor
well if id known about this
id have cut my price
boys these two professors
are going with us as cargo
what
you heard me
have you blown a gasket
nobody takes a female along in a pigboat
look junior you gonna give me
that 2000-year-old navy bilge
that theyre bad luck
take a look at her
what so bad about that
nothing absolutely nothing
theyre all jonahs it traditional
look skipper i made up my mind
count me out
okay
anybody else
ill give you jokers five minutes
to sleep on it and remember
if i have to
i can replace every one of you
captain i do not like it either
oh scusami
perhaps you are right
in your estimation
i am a a female
but first i am a scientist
and a good one
and i am not the only scientist
who is not of your sex
there are many
like dr lise meitner
who played an important part
in the development of the atom bomb
like madame curie who discovered radium
i have grown up in laboratories
all my life i have worked with men
never have i interfered
and never have they resented me
professor montel and i have
have much to accomplish
much
and i shall appreciate it
if you would not let my my presence
be the cause of of a minor mutiny
i like you
i like you all
and i shall try my best
to make you like me
as a scientist
man that was quite a mouthful
for a female
that no female that a scientist
all right come on
we got a lot of work to do let go
hi mr fujimori professor
where your assistant
are you prepared to sail
ill let you know tomorrow
after we make the running dive tests
there no tomorrow left for us
the freighter kiang ching
sailed from tientsin a half hour ago
you must leave right away
what are you talking about
we only been working for two weeks weve
got a lot of work left to do on this tub
you must leave by dark to overtake her
what about the running tests
as an amateur might i suggest
that we try the running test
while we are running
doc there are about a hundred ways
of losing a submarine
youve just come up with one of the best
we havent even checked
the torpedo tubes yet
you know what that means if we have
to call on fish it means were dead
youve got to leave tonight
okay buster youre buying this trip
you want me to chance it
it not what we want captain jones
it what must be done
all right just as long as the professor
here knows what he letting himself in for
weve arranged airplane contact to give you
position on the kiang ching
howll they contact us blinker or radio
neither is without risk
weve decided cork drop is safest
this contains your code
and this contains
your schedule for contacts
oh just one more thing
i want a clear-cut directive
detailing my specific authority
youll find it all in here captain
at sea you are in complete command
on land professor montel is in command
may i wish you the best of luck
thanks
well now as good a time as any
mr neuman
take her down to periscope depth

stand right over there
youll be all right
thank you
professor gerard give me your hand
watch that top rung it murder
thank you
youre welcome
you sit right here
captain trim satisfactory

ill take care of it captain
everything tight
in the forward torpedo room
were gonna try her down deep
have all stations checked let me know
ay ay captain
this is that test we were
talking about today professor
now
now
dont get nervous if we crack up
you wont get a chance to feel it
take it easy itll be all right
put her on the bottom mr neuman

what with the air banks holter
the air bank dry
open the emergency banks
put em on the line
they wont open
theyve got to open
weve checked everything
these signs are all fouled up
ill have to try every valve
no wait a minute
joto come to the control room

ay ay captain
you wont need your umbrella professor
she a dry boat
it nothing to worry about
almost everybody gets a touch
of claustrophobia first time down
it not claustrophobia captain
it the realization that at last
our mission has begun
if anyone had told me six months ago
that today i would be on a submarine
headed for arctic waters
in search of a secret atomic base
i just cant believe it
yeah i know what you mean
well
what about your assistant professor
what makes a girl who looks like that
get mixed up in science
she comes from a family of scientists
she was a child prodigy
at 4 she entered college
at 8 she studied at göttingen
she is really very brilliant
a child prodigy
with a body by fisher
and this is the greatest pigboat
in the whole submarine service
the uss bowfin
it one we served on together
me the chief gunner
dugboat and the skipper
beautiful aingt she
oh yes very beautiful
you know something else
that very beautiful
all my life ive been wanting
to find a girl called denise
oh ski
im sure you will find her
oh i found her all right

okay
you know what a log is
yes

i was working on a new formula
when ski asked if he
could show me his chest
show you his chest
yes
oh
and then what
then he removed his shirt
no kidding
he wanted me to see his tattoo
oh no
it was a beautiful tattoo
ill bet it was

dont you think
yes
yes
au revoir professor
now listen to me
i dont want any more beefs
you understand
if i hear of anybody
making a play for that girl
ill personally shoot him out
through torpedo tube number one
captain is it still a secret
where were going
were tailing a freighter
to an island in the north pacific
gonna sink her
were gonna sneak into this island
take a look and sneak out
this is a scientific expedition
but skipper what are we looking for
four-leaf clovers
well what if the guys on the island
dont like us
look i know youre all
itching for a little action
but youll only get it if we
have to defend ourselves so relax
capitaine jones
le capitaine jones
bonne nuit
bonne nuit
oh good morning
was the water hot enough professor
just wonderful thank you
voulez-vous fume une cigarette
what
im speaking french
oh
voulez-vous fume une cigarette
oh you mean voulez-vous
fumer une cigarette
that what i said
no fumer
foo-may
no no no
you have to form your lips like this
fumer
fumer
fumer
fumer
i think i better go now
thank you
you know someday im gonna
find out what color her eyes are
good morning captain jones
you wanted to see me
why did you let me sleep
through that plane contact
i thought you needed the rest
you were on duty for almost 20 hours
didnt you stop to think
how important that message might be
of course
so i made sure that it was not
by decoding it myself
as you see
it reports only that the kiang ching
has made no change in speed or course
i knew that was of no importance
professor did it ever occur to you
that i might be steering a course to be
youve lost us approximately two hours
im very sorry captain
and i think i have learned something
i hope so
if you want to listen in on conversations
use the intercom it easier
that conversation i would
prefer not to have heard
but i was waiting to see you
okay you see me im busy
many years have i been
with professor montel
but never before have i heard
anyone speak like you
to the greatest scientist in his field
professor montel field isnt commanding
a screwball submarine mine is
if such rudeness is necessary
i hope this will be a very short cruise
whatd you want to see me about
joto
yes sir
in the future when a message
comes in to this boat i get it
no matter who says it unnecessary
you understand
yes sir
oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
no no no no
this time he was right
may we come on the bridge
sure help yourself
contact plane
approaching on schedule
good enough
okay charlie
there it is
well this one for you doc
intelligence reports kiang ching carrying
unconventional-type 6 capsule
signed fujimori what a 6 capsule
the charge to explode an a-bomb
hey skipper radar shows
surface object approaching
bearing 355 degrees
speed
cant tell yet but he closing fast
range
3800 yards
maybe the freighter has seen
our signal and comes after us
rig for red
a sub after us
a sub i thought this was
a scientific expedition
it is and were gonna play it safe
no use getting a bloody nose
unless we have to
she submerged and listening for us
that why she stopped pinging
what does this mean
it means she saving her torpedoes
waiting till we surface
just one more day doc
and wed have finished
overhauling those torpedo tubes
can you see her scope
no
well we can play possum too
how the hydrogen
built up to three percent
well we cant chance surfacing here
weve got to make a run for it
professor i think youd both
better stay in your quarters
down scope
theyre still on our stern skipper
how that hydrogen gas
four percent and still building
take her up
okay charlie
you better keep off the bridge professor
im not going up
the skipperd blow his top if he even
found you here in the control room
sit down professor grab some air
thank you
have you identified the submarine
no we havent even seen her yet
theyre topside trying to spot her now
no sign of her yet skipper
sonar tells us she not far
alert the gun crew
what
i know were not looking for trouble
but wed be fools
not to protect ourselves
alert for battle stations
gun crew stand by to man the deck gun
what about these torpedoes
you know those tubes havent been checked
forget the torpedoes
where is she now joto
range 500
either she moving out
or she gonna surface
there she is skipper
theyre coming out on deck
ask them where we are charlie
why not man the five-incher now
no
the minute they spot a crew near that gun
theyll throw torpedoes at us
what are they saying
they want to know who we are
and what were doing here
tell em were a private scientific
expedition headed for the arctic
they insist on boarding us
well keep stalling
tell em we dont understand
ask them to repeat the message
put one over our bow
keep asking them to repeat charlie
turn our nose into her steer 00
and get ready to man that gun
keep clear of the lifeline
right full rudder
torpedo
clear the deck clear the deck
dive
close the hatch
my hand my hand
my hand
give me a knife
no no no
my hand
no
here
how is he how is he
it his thumb
all right get em all below
hey you guys come on up here
give me a hand quick
we ship too much water cant hold her up
get the angle off
and let her settle to the bottom
all back full
enemy torpedo fired
number two fish
out of their basket
secure all running machinery
remain silent
bilge pump motor flooded skipper
form a bucket line
dump the water in the engine room bilges
that tub laying for us skipper
she coming real close
i lost her
nothing out of her now no sound
what do you think skipper
i think she pulling
the same trick we are
now watch that salt water
we dont want any chlorine gas in the boat
hold it
captain this hot heat is killing us
we got to turn on the fans
if they heard our fans you wouldnt have
to worry about the heat killing you boy
all right ill fill in the picture
for you quick
we got torpedoes but our tubes
arent in condition to fire em
and the red sub parked
on the bottom like we are
waiting to pick us up on sonar
once she does
shell throw more fish at us
so it a question of who can hold out
longer without air the reds or us
if we break first chances are
itll be our last break
and were loaded with hydrogen
were liable to explode
but we got one thing in our favor
we can save oxygen by shutting up
that all
nothing
nothing
we gotta save juice
shift to red
keep your ears open ski
i am sorry captain for being so stupid
that all right save your breath
you had to use the knife
if you didnt close the hatch
we would all be dead
youre beat
you better get back to your bunk
and take it easy come on
i want to tell you how
dont talk
skipper
he in a bad way
i thought that hypo was gonna do the trick but
he suffering from shock and loss of blood
if he dont get some air right away youre
gonna have only one professor for cargo
there 50 grand in that bunk
fifty grand is worth a little air
joto turn on the white lights
boys im gonna try a long shot
if her first couple of torpedoes
miss us we got a chance
id rather pass out without air than have
a torpedo come plowing through us
now when we start the pump
were liable to get a spark
maybe itll burn off the hydrogen
maybe it wont
if it doesnt
well blow up so fast
youll never feel it
good luck to all of us
you got everything straight
yes sir
now here where we find out
if weve lived right
no more chance of explosion
pass the word along
and build up the turns slowly
hold down the noise
yes sir
all ahead one-third
yes sir
take her up and level her
to 75 feet mr neuman
yes sir
she speeded up skipper
bearing 240 degrees
right full rudder all ahead flank
stand by to ram
stand by to ram
range 200 bearing 00 degrees
left full rudder
take her down to 90 feet
90 feet
stand by to ram
all back emergency

i couldnt feel better

youre wasting your time junior
hi
hello

well how the hand professor
wonderful captain as you see
good glad to hear it
and how are you professor
im fine thank you
swell you know when i
captain jones
come topside please
freighter in sight of land
excuse me
bonne chance
i dont understand
our intelligence report
cannot be this wrong
all we are getting is a normal count
you ought to be happy
dont misunderstand
nothing would please me more than
to know that our suspicions are unfounded
then let move out
there nothing here but this two-bit
garrison and some beat-up storage tanks
it a great pity i cannot talk to them
we are worlds apart
but after all they are human
let go
but neuman
forget it shot right through the head
let get out of here
ski try to knock out that light
all right come on let get outta here
you yellow dogs
come on ski give me a hand
let get him in the boat
you wanted to talk to one of these humans
i got one for you
wet down your coats
well they must be combing
the whole area for us
but so far nothing
not even a seagull
hey dugboat you sure this jelly im
rubbing on my chest wont eat off my tattoo
what are you worried about
you can always get another
are you nuts
that my piece be resistance
your piece be what
that french
i been practicing nessie-pas
you need more practice
captain jones professor montel
wants to see you in sick bay
want more coffee
no no thank you chin lee thank you
this is wonderful
you want to see me professor
yes
denise has just translated his orders
his name is sin he a pilot en route
to kevlock island for special duty
so what
kevlock must be the island
captain taylor photographed
well how do you figure that
an air force pilot would hardly be assigned
to duty on an island without an airstrip
and as you know kevlock is the only island
indicated by name in this entire chain
it appears to be due north
of our present position
and what do you suggest we do about it
it seems to me our course is obvious
not in my book doc
what do you mean
i mean you said once that each man
got his own reason for living
and his own price for dying
well my reason for living is 50 grand
im not sticking my neck out again
is one neck that important captain
it is when it mine
what kind of man are you
hold it hold it
let not gang up
with a lot of double-talk
im a businessman
maybe to a couple of flag-wavers like you
im a mercenary all right
but i lived up to my part of the contract
the deal was to tail
the freighter to the island
put you ashore and get you back to tokyo
nobody said anything
about a second island
so as far as im concerned
mission completed were going home
any objections
yes
i hate to use authority
but if i have to i will
i didnt want it to come to this
but as long as you have
mentioned the contract
study it closely captain
you will find a paragraph stating that i
and i alone
shall determine when
the mission is finished
and in my book captain
the mission will be finished
after i am taken to kevlock
given the chance to examine the island
and returned to tokyo
joto
yes sir
head due north
did you say north
you heard me
set a new course for kevlock island
it on your chart
yes sir
okay doc let go
what the matter
my knee
i thought you said it was okay this morning
it was
ill manage in a few moments
not a chance youd just be in the way
it will improve by tomorrow im sure of it
sorry doc
were not hanging around these waters
that long this is a powder keg
wait wait a minute wait a minute what
going on what are you talking about
captain jones
my assistant will accompany you
what
she has sufficient training
to compute figures
determine strength and identify elements
if there are any on this island
you mean youd youd let her go
with the exception of me
professor gerard
is the only member of this expedition
capable of performing this task
oh youre both crazy
you will take her ashore
and follow her instructions
as you would have followed mine
she is not going and that final
you still cannot take an order
can you captain jones
and what behind that crack
exactly what you think is behind it
ski you stay here keep your eyes open
what about her
i could carry her equipment
she can take care of her own equipment
take a look down there
looks like a bunch of doors
im afraid we have found
what we are looking for
a geiger counter reaction like this
can mean only one thing
these figures
what are they saying
they are looking for lumfong
a missing soldier
we gotta stay put
till they move out come on
what did you mean when you said
i still cant take an order
your record captain
in the war you were a very good officer
except for one thing
go on im fascinated
you could give orders
but you couldnt take them
now look i
i know what youre talking about
but if you want to know
what makes a guy tick
youve got to look beyond the record
those philippine guerrillas
were cut off and surrounded
they had to have ammunition and supplies
i couldnt just sit there
on my can and let em die
i knew the waters were mined
but i figured i could get in
get out without a scratch
so i wrote my own orders
i lost my sub and 26 men
and if i had to id do it again
im sorry
very sorry
it was wrong of me even to mention it
forget it it all over
you all right
fine
when this is over if we get back
what gives with you
gives
i mean what are you gonna do
go back to paris i suppose
paris is my home
yeah
and you
when this is over what gives with you
i dont know
have you ever been in paris
no never
you would love it
americans always do
well we cant stay here
if they hold us up till morning
we might never get back
im gonna see if there
another way out of here come on
you stay here ill be right back
here
you wont need this but sometimes
the sight of it a comfort
ill be back in a minute
lumfong
lumfong
denise
give me that come on
let get out of here
come on
hurry up come on
come on
let go
this confirms our worst fears
the atomic reaction is unmistakable
i dont get it
i mean i cant figure out
why that bomber was on the runway
what would a b-29
be doing on a red air base
it just doesnt make sense
say didnt you tell me
that that red officer
we picked up on the other island
was in the air force
yes a major
were you ever able to question him
impossible
i tried but he would not say a word
oh
oh thanks
hey did you talk to that
chinese prisoner chin lee
he has not seen the prisoner
the prisoner has not seen him
holter dig up that portable microphone
and plant it in the torpedo room
then get the prisoner and lock him in there
make sure he doesnt see the microphone
right
give him a hand ski
come on let get into some dry clothes
we got work to do
you have a plan
im gonna find out what this is all about
come on chin lee
we got a job for you let go
you guys got everything set
yep
okay
now youre sure chin lee understands
exactly what he supposed to say
whatd he say
he says he would do anything for you
he wants you to strike him in the face
to make it look more real
holter
he wants you to do it
he says it will not hurt if you do it
you all right boy you okay
what he saying
he says
the prisoner is very intelligent
and must be fooled
he wants you to hit him harder
im sorry pal
all right get him out let go
here come on take em
this is incredible
what it all about skipper
this is the screwball plot of all time
theyre gonna drop an atomic bomb
on korea or manchuria and blame it on us
theyre taking off tomorrow at dawn
in that made-over bomber
he found him out
now listen to me
im shoving off for the island alone
ill park myself right here
around the mouth of this cave
youll submerge half a mile
beyond the runway right around here
so youll be able to spot my signal
now a heavy load of fuel
gonna bring that bomber out low
so when i give you the signal
two short two long two short
thatll mean the plane taking off
thatll give you just time
enough to surface and fire
i want every gun in action
that means everybody
that plane has to be
knocked out of the sky
now the minute you hit it
crash dive to the bottom and stay there
because everything gonna break loose
when that bomber hits
there a cove at the north end
right here that where ill hide
tomorrow night at 000 sharp
ill give you three short blinkers
pick me up
if i dont show up
shove off head for home
any questions
i forbid this insanity
forbid all you want to professor
that plane is not gonna make it
it is dreadful enough to bring back
the terrifying report
that our suspicions are confirmed
but we cannot take it upon ourselves
to commit an act of war
no matter how we feel
we are civilians
i am responsible for this expedition
i order you to take this submarine
back to tokyo
i dont care about you
and your expedition
there an enemy bomber out there
made up to look like an american bomber
it gonna drop the biggest egg in history
and were gonna take the rap for it
i dont like that
so from now on professor
this is my expedition
skipper
the boat gone
what
the boat gone montel took it
well why didnt you stop him
we didnt get the chance
he was on deck with her before we knew
what happened he was in the boat and gone
where the girl
on the bridge
please he doesnt want you to stop him
why didnt you stop him
all you had to do was yell
he knows your plan
hell carry it out that his orders
that the trouble with you geniuses
full of big ideas
now youre fouling up the whole works
you know that island crawling with soldiers
he knows that too
then whyd you let a nice old guy like that
take a shortcut to the cemetery
he no ordinary two-bit professor
you know
he montel top man in his field
but he old and helpless doesnt
know his way outside of a test tube
you oughta know that
you work close enough with him
what kind of a woman are you
stop
havent you got any feelings
stop
he my father
what
my father
oh im sorry denise
im sorry forgive me
he said it was his place to go
not yours
im sorry
she sure got a lot of guts
only thing i cant figure out
is why the big mystery
why didnt she let us know
he her old man
well that what you have to pay
for having a famous father
she been on a spot all her life
wanted to make good
on her own and she did
and he was proud because she did
any sign of him at all
no not yet
there he is
and there his signal
battle surface gun action down scope
youd better get below
please
okay
all right ski let go
come on willie joto get up here
hurry it up hurry it up
fire
you all right
oh
the bomb must have gone off under us
bring her back on course
take her up to periscope depth
periscope depth
all compartments
report damage and casualties
the bomber didnt crash in the ocean
it hit the island
head for home
each man
has his own reason for living mr jones
and his own price for dying
-----NewMovie-----

a perfect spot by an old tree
and we lay down
and looked up at the sky
and then he said

yeah
so
where to
all new york is holding its breath
as the hostage crisis
continues to unfold
just 30 minutes ago
police came across
this startling sight
a young woman
held hostage in a taxi
suspended 80 stories
above the ground
in what appears to be
a giant web
every attempt by the police
to rescue the hostage
has been thwarted
by the sandman
compounding the danger
is the appearance
of a strange black-suited figure
early reports had believed him
to be the black-suited spider-man
but he has now been identified
as something entirely different
the hostage has been identified
as mary jane watson
an actress recently seen
in a brief stint on broadway
were now going to take you
live to the scene
with jennifer dugan jennifer
were only about
00 feet away now hal and
wait there seems to be
some kind of activity in the web
they seem to be creating
some kind of gigantic lettering
spider-man being challenged
to some sort of confrontation
and that raises serious questions
about what kind of chance hed
stand against such overwhelming
harry
i need your help
i cant take them both
not by myself
you dont deserve my help
harry
she needs us
get out
if i may sir
ive seen things in this house
ive never spoken of
what are you trying to tell me
the night your father died
i cleaned his wound
the blade that pierced his body
came from his glider
i know youre trying to defend
your father honor
but there no question
that he died by his own hand
i loved your father
as i have loved you harry
as your friends love you
look
spider-man spider-man
spider-man
he seems to have
come out of nowhere
to answer the prayers of the city
just when all hope
seemed to be lost
peter theyre gonna kill us both
im gonna get you out of this
watch out
hey parker
my god eddie
my spider-sense is tingling

hi
so youre a lawyer
honey it super dry
wills and estates mostly yeah
when did you get back into town
just now
the library gone
yeah yeah
it burned to the ground
about eight years ago
it was a huge fire
it was a terrible tragedy
those poor schoolchildren with
nothing to do with their free time
right so
i need to plan the funeral
oh i did that already
i did it all by myself
sorry where were we
everything okay over there
yeah
im im glad youre in town
why
well you know youre next of kin
you got to sign the documents
relevant documents there
all sorts of stuff and
i mean i just always kind of assumed
you would never be coming home
my mom died i mean why wouldnt
i come home cause of the article
right yeah of course
so when do we read the will
after the funeral
right
ive bothered you
after business hours so
ill let you get back to your
wife i assume youre married
oh yeah actually
okay well
thanks for everything
you actually know my wi
sweetie we talk about you warning
me before you release your demons
that face you make
it like staring into the sun
a lot of that is involuntary
you didnt call
what was i supposed to say
you will now have a passage from
maureen first victoria book
read by heather mitchell president of the
victoria of the true north festival committee
victoria had always been aware
ever since her first memories
that she was very near
to a world of deviant morality
but sometimes
just for a moment
her loved ones neared it
and she caught a glimpse
of the bewitching world beyond
and she knew that it would be
her life work
to keep herself and
others from it
i hate everything
remember when you left me here
alone with all of these people
the sooner i get out of here
the better
she just had to show up today
oh my god
it her mother funeral
oh button it
im gonna go give her a piece of my mind
honey dont
is this really the best place
for a confrontation like this
cassie cranston
heather murray
or is it mitchell now
on behalf of beaver ridge
welcoming committee
i would like to formally let you
know that you are not welcome
that is
you are not welcome here
as far as condolences go
that was original
did i do something
you did something to this entire town
right the article is that it
you may have grown up here
but you know nothing about us
i mean we get up to some
pretty wild shenanigans
like what
the true north festival
the apple butter parade
hey i dont mean to butt in here
but i will not stand idly by while
you trash talk the apple butter parade
bruce can we give cassie a break
whose side are you on really adam
wipe that smile off your face
you think youre the only one
who had a little excitement
well let me tell you i have
had my share of excitement
okay do tell
i slept with a black
man in college
my stars
ever been with a woman
i kissed a girl once i didnt care for it
sex tape
we make them and watch them
often big whoop anything else
have you ever been in an orgy
im sorry
hey you know hon
it been kind of a rough day
weve got a little time before
dinner maybe we could you know
im not ovulating
yeah i know i know
i just thought maybe
we could have a little fun
sweetie
no fun time was yesterday just
just like the schedule says remember
you just have to keep your sperm
fresh you dont need me for that
besides it really turns me on to
think of you doing that to yourself
yeah
yeah i could do that
hey you wanna watch
no that okay that okay
yeah
you look beautiful cassie
it okay
it just us
it always been just us
but i ran away
youre not going anywhere now
are you freaking kidding me
well the results say that adam
suffers from necrzoospermia
which means that all of his sperm
are non-viable which means dead
all of them
there really nothing we can do
im sorry doctor i just dont know what
im supposed to do in this situation
after all this time i know
how frustrated you must be
the waiting list for sperm banks and adoption
agencies are at least two to three years
if you want my honest completely
off-the-record opinion if it were me
i would try to get a friend or someone
i knew to give me a personal donation
first you folks tell me
what you paid for it
then well have a good laugh about it
and well start jewing them down
the hell with it
line one for you bruce
yes thank you georgina
the buck stops here
how can i help you
bruce it heather mitchell
youre the only heather in town
you dont need to tell me your full
name every single time you call
you know
not a lot of funerals end
with an orgy throw-down
id go to an orgy
no you wouldnt
i can grow a mustache for it
or a soul patch
whatever
ill have you know
im an extremely sexual person
oh my god
i had a sex dream about you once
i dont want to know that
do you have any idea how many
people ive had sex dreams about
it hardly an exclusive club
okay
so how was i
oh screw you whatever
if i sucked it probably because
you have a shitty imagination
you know what i knew youd be weird
about this i knew you would be
youre my boss dude
and you babysat me once
i think it is actually illegal for
you to be into me or something
first of all i did not say i was into
you and secondly i didnt babysit you
we played videogames while our moms
smoked cigarettes and played bridge
so it doesnt
that what guys do though isnt it
they befriend a girl just to gain her
trust so that they can have sex with them
i mean why else are you friends with me
must be your shining personality
your sarcastic tone
is unnecessary
hey heather what going on
in the matter of the last will and
testament of maureen margaret cranston
she has declared that her residuals
from any book sales which as you know
are still quite considerable as
well as any assets that she has
financial institutions holdings
etcetera be used to build
a new town library
im sorry what
she wants to build a library remember
i told you the library burned down
i could show you the blueprints
if you give me a second here
because they are
something to behold
they spared no expense
is this a joke
no were still on dial-up
yeah
town council actually voted
down high-speed internet
something about
ready access to pornography
no no i mean about the money
there there nothing
no that not true
you can live in the house for
as long as you should want to
well what would that be worth
it not i mean
a lot but again if you
should choose to sell the house
go right back into the library
so she left me nothing then
well heather actually made you
this casserole so
there three kinds of cheese and
there broccolini in there i think
would you mind giving
me a minute please
alone
yeah yeah
oh my god of course
hello
hey i was just calling to
check in see how youre doing
well you know
im pretty terrible actually
okay
i dont have your book
next week is fine
no i mean
i dont have your book
i havent written anything
i came back here hoping i could use my
inheritance to pay back the advance
but my mother didnt
leave me anything
nothing
we had plans
i know
all this time
why didnt you say something
i dont know
i fucked up
look
im gonna make this easy for you because
youre going through a lot right now
it doesnt have to be the book
that you originally pitched me
but it has to be something
it has to be sexy
and honest and raw
dig deep
you have 24 hours to send me
a pitch or return the money
and if neither of those happen
you know any good lawyers
nope just a shitty small-town one
and here we are
hey you werent counting
on these royalties were you
no of course not
yeah right
big city writer right
it nice to see you i mean
with lots of terrible
circumstances but
you never realize
how much you miss somebody
until
until what
i dont know where i was
going with that i just
you know i just didnt like how
things ended with us obviously
you mean like how you ran off like
a coward and you hid in the bathroom
yes that that yeah
you know technically
we never really ended things
yeah
and we never broke up
i came back for you adam
okay i cant tell
if youre messing with me
cant you
i
hey
whatre you doing here
well i could ask you
the same thing sugar pie
just the estate meeting today
of course
is what were doing talking about it
what are you doing here
well i was hoping we could have
a little chat just us girls
so you and adam
absolutely
it funny i just never really
pictured you two together
you know
he will make a wonderful father
well sounds like you have your future
all mapped out that really nice
so funny thing
i was re-reading
that one article of yours
some very witty and wonderful
turns of phrase by the way
no wonder it caught a virus
went viral
and i was thinking you may
be right about a few things
perhaps we are a little bit
sexually repressed
at any rate i was thinking
you know we probably could use a
little shake up here in beaver ridge
and i think your orgy idea
is just the ticket
what
hang on my orgy-what-now
ill organize and you can instruct
no
at least think about it it
really the least you could do
actually
the least i can do is nothing
well now who being
the small-minded one
you know i thought you would jump
at the chance to watch all of us
make fools of ourselves as we delve
into the perversions of your mind
you know probably give you fodder
for a whole new series of articles
how to plan an orgy in a small town
if you can come up with a better title
unless of course
you cant handle it
so all i would have
to do is instruct
i mean like
i wouldnt actually have to
fornicate with us oh god no
heather wants me to
plan a sex party
oh that fucking hilarious
but what wrong
im a virgin
so just to clarify everything
you know about sex is bullshit
no that that not true
ive
interviewed people
and i go to bars and
i belong to a few sex clubs
it just no applied knowledge
wait
did your father molest you
alice jesus christ
okay
well im sorry i just have to
ask cause that happens to people
and then they get all psychologically
mashed up and then they
like their vagina sealed shut
so they cant even have sex
okay well it not that
cause youre terrified of sex
no
im just waiting for
someone i can trust
i need a new drink cause i
just threw up in that one
okay fuck off
will you come with me
to this thing or not
sweetie youre my very best
friend in this whole stupid town
i will totally come to your orgy
and i will totally be there for you
and i will totally bang
all the hot guys that show up
that was fast
what the verdict
im digging deep
you ready
i dont know
i feel like im gonna throw up
i mean i mean
can we do this is this us
are we are we orgy people
what were not is quitters
now if we dont go downstairs
and open that door
then everything that cassie cranston thinks
about us and beaver ridge will be true
shell think that were cowards
is that what you want her
to think about you
so i know all of you
are sexually active
but what you are about to
embark on needs to be treated
and seen with the respect
of a sport okay
there will be surprises
the odd queef
yeah okay yeah
what is a queef
okay it like flatulence
that comes out of your
basically youre hammering
large quantities of air
into a tight moist space
so sounds are gonna be made
next stamina
it gonna go a lot faster than
you think pornography lies
no man can go properly for 40
minutes without having an aneurism
and at that point any woman vagina is
gonna be squealing like a worn-out brake pad
at the end of a
high-speed chase
are these colorful phrases
really necessary
you need to know what to expect
you need to stay hydrated
youre gonna sweat which
brings me to my next topic
sex stank
youre not gonna
notice your own
but you will notice other peoples
and in a room full of people sweating
and mashing their genitals
together it gonna create a
musk
how bad could it possibly be
bad thick
it gonna seep into everything
thank god i got these
lovely plastic couch covers
so shall we just dive right in
well
i think this was supposed
to just be a preliminary chat
did anyone here think we were
just gonna dive right in
okay well
okay guys
i think if youre gonna do this
you just have to rip the band-aid
off and do it you know
yeah
heather do you have an egg timer
yes i do yeah
that way we can set
the timer for 5 minutes
and give everybody a chance to
switch it up if they want to
i
all right
were gonna kick it old-school
gentlemen
put your keys in the bowl
yeah
i walked here can i use fishing license
how do you not have keys
who locks their door
so my choices are adam
or bruce
cant have sex with adam
he your husband
right i mean why would
you want to sleep with me
youre right
i was kidding
okay bruce
let make the best of it
a little less enthusiasm
please
how are we not already having sex
im sorry im sorry i just
you youre really beautiful
im sorry
it okay you know what im
gonna do im gonna close my eyes
and im just gonna imagine that you have
leprosy otherwise this is gonna
and that not
you shouldnt tell people that
no okay just give me a
second give me a second
okay im good now
im good nope nope
that my jawbone yeah
oh so defiant
slow it down slow it way down
slow it way down
okay
oh my god your lips
my lips
theyre so soft
what do you put on them
well wine wine mostly
wait wait wait wait wait no
no no no no no no i cant
no no no no just hold it
hold on
stop staring it rude
where am i supposed to look
is this turning you on
it not not turning me on
three two wait
no i need i need six
no that it
come on i was just getting my groove on
time up chester
yeah im sorry excuse me im gonna
need a few minutes to pardon me
replenish the fluids here cause
did you already
i just grazed the tip i grazed it
please tell me it was on the couch cover
im ready to party
jeez
is that normal
god no
why dont we have some make-up sex
oh no
did not all the energy in here
just get sucked out
no no it didnt
i think we ripped the band-aid
off a little too quickly here
we should have catered
a potluck would have been nice
cassie i feel like were gonna
need some spare dicks
in case you know chappy gets pre-maturely
excited just keep the party going
i can hear you
agreed
you know what would be good is maybe
if we had some other ladies as well
people from around town or
cassie if you wanted get involved
no i mean i that wasnt
that wasnt part of the
no okay
i think this little experiment has just
proven that we need to go a little bit slower
so let get together again
but this time
ease into it focus on the basics
and if all goes well then round two
i dont wanna sound like a jerk but what
am i supposed to do with this erection
i saw a papaya on the counter there
you could probably have your way with
no it too ripe
it not gonna work
why do you know that
what about michael lobucks
he got a terrible back issue
he wouldnt the last 5 minutes
what about the mayor
gus gus been there
they cant be black
oh my god
wait gus is black
mrs reddick
bruce she dead
margo and dave anderson
no no absolutely not have
you seen how he plays charades
im not getting into a sexual
situation with that man
so there a bunch of us and
were doing this thing okay
and i dont know how to ask
weve been encouraged to invite
other people to the thing
what were gonna be doing is
what kind of thing is it
were gonna it like a
pri it like a very
it a private fun thing
yeah
like were all
we are all together
in the private thing where you touch each
other nipples and you fuck each other
how do you know what are you
stop trying to invite me to the orgy
how do you know about the orgy
how do i not know about the orgy
bruce is all over town
and you need to talk to that guy
because everybody in this town is
gonna know what you idiots are up to
okay okay okay so did
bruce invite you to it already
yes he did
he did
yes
so you
no no i knew you
were gonna ask me that
you disappoint me chester
what
you guys havent rsvped
to my party yet
hey seth man how long
have you been standing there
actually funny that youre here because
chester has something that he wants to ask you
no
there this thing that happening
and people are encouraged
no that not
to invite other people
and he wanted to talk to you
about this thing
what coming i gotta grab
this this delivery
really interesting
i gotta get this delivery here
isnt that your bathroom
what
are you going to the bathroom
hey seth
hi pauline
how is your day going buddy
it busy
yeah
so you want to have an orgy in a town
where you can dial the wrong number
and still have a ten-minute conversation
ill owe you
i really need to work the numbers
in my favor and you coming
helps knock some of the other guys out
how
you know
you smoke a pole man you know
the pole
you play the skin flute you put penises
in your mouth cause youre gay
not cause youre happy
cause youre a homosexual
not that you couldnt be a homosexual
and be happy im sure you love it
so
you want me at this
orgy because im gay
and that will force one of the
other non-gay men to sleep with me
which will make more women
available for you
look
i really need this man
allie leaving me it was
it was a huge hit to my ego
if i agree to this you give me
the full commission on your house
that a big commission man
are you coming to my birthday party
jesus christ
my mom wanted an rsvp like yesterday
i dont know man
you should totally come
to our party seth
i
alice
fuck jesus seth
you havent rsvped to my party yet

it just my mom she doesnt know how
many cupcakes to make she freaking out
okay
are you going to that party
what party

bruce told me about some party at adam
that been cancelled
are you sure because he just
told me about it like just now
well seth i dont know
because bruce is an idiot

tomorrow my party anyways
so you can just tell everybody
to rsvp and then they can come
okay i ill try to remember
can i have a glass of water
i dont i dont have any water
im thirsty
do you have a blanket im cold
so i think the first thing
we need to do here is just
acknowledge the awkwardness
of the situation
so chester if maybe we could switch
spots so you could sit over here
you wanna do
yeah
okay
so let start with heather
how does it make you feel
to see adam with someone else
well i
i think we can all be adults here

that very neighborly of you
of both of you
im very neighborly
is this is this hard for you adam
oh it hard for me
i mean it would that would be
hard for me that would be challenging
yeah what about this heather

weird way to open a shirt anyway

positions for us to try here
what really me
get lost
thank you i would be honored
if we could just skip the lego instructions
i mean clearly ive done this before
i really just need someone
to bang the baby out of me
also if you could ejaculate directly inside
my wife vagina that would be great
it actually contains
prosteligence
which can stimulate the cervix
and can cause contractions

you wanna pee on me
that is not even close to what i said
okay bruce why dont you try
putting her leg over your shoulder

anna told me that you got her
pregnant without even trying

this feels so fucking good
why dont you ever
feel this fucking good
she doesnt mean that guys
that the baby talking
can we get this guy off
this is my wife here
just a little bit of help guys
would be really
screamer okay there it is
there we go
i would throw those out
see what did i tell you
about the plastic couch covers
what a great night guys
thank you
can i ask a silly question
how come none of you have realized
what a terrible idea this is
i mean for one night
of awkward pleasure
you are gonna jeopardize
friendships
marriages even
look around these are
your neighbors your friends
i just want to make sure
that youve thought about this
really thought about it
this is a small town
people are gonna find out
one of you will talk
maybe not right away
but eventually
i read cassie article and the reason why
it upset at everybody is cause she right
you are not the type of people
to do this sort of thing
youre not adventurous
who are you trying to fool
half a dozen chimps
are locked in a room
and in the center of the room
there a ladder
on top of which a banana
dangles from the ceiling
so one the chimps decides
to go for the banana
but before he can even touch the ladder
theyre all sprayed with ice cold water
im so confused right now
shut up
so after a while
they figure out the connection
between the ladder and the water and
they dont go for the banana anymore
so then one of the chimps
is replaced by a new chimp
and he decides to
go for the banana
before he can even touch the
ladder they they attack him
he goes for it again and they literally
they beat the message into him
do not touch the fucking ladder
eventually all the chimps are
replaced by an entirely new group
they dont know about the water
they dont even know it exists
but anytime any of them
go for that banana
they attack them
and they have no idea why
all they know is
this is what happens when you go
after the thing you want the most
something someone else
says you cant have
and they never question it
it just what they do
so my question is
are you gonna go
after your banana
or are you gonna let all the
other chimps knock you down
did that make anyone else a little bit hard
bruce there are ladies present
im sorry
did it make anyone hard or wet
look yall want this
you need this
and if youre in
then im in too
all the way
id like to go after my banana
me too
can i put the whole
thing in my mouth
saturday my place

the cruise with me

town you dont need these people
theyve never accepted you

thank you very much cassie and i then
i
i wanna have sex with spencer
are you serious spencer gay
youre the only one in town
who actually thinks that
oh seriously really
what about that fruity real estate job you
have what about your hair the clothes
that awesome cologne
i dont wear cologne that just me
okay
cassie wants to have sex with spencer
who else wants to have sex with spencer
for fucks sake
who are you sleeping with then
adam
no i dont think so
guess what cock-blocking isnt actually
on the list of things to do in an orgy
so why dont you let adam decide
who hed like to stick it in
okay
you know youre all
wonderful people and
polly would be
awkward
and weird
okay
alice my main concern with you is that i
wouldnt be able to meet your level of
experience
go fuck yourself
so i guess i choose cassie
too late i already called dibs on her
okay stop it
im not participating in anything
where dibs take precedence
have sex with me please
i said no
god you are such a hypocrite cassie
you you run off with your vagina
and your sexy article things
and then you have an issue
sleeping with some mildly-annoying person
that youve known your entire life
no you do not get to be a
prude and the town slut
youre having sex with bruce
and that that
jesus fucking christ heather she
not a slut she just a virgin
yeah cassie a virgin
that would be rich
but i everything that i know about
sex is because of your column
yeah me too
this makes a lot of sense
id like you all to leave now
okay okay im sure this is
extremely embarrassing for you
but weve all
been looking forward to this
so i think that we should
get out
were having our carpets
cleaned there nowhere to go
get out
it her house you guys just
shut up alice you get the fuck out first
alice hey alice
alice excuse me hey
dont what the fuck do you want bruce
what the fuck were you doing
you really ruined that for me
in there whatre you doing
i could not give a baker fuck
a baker fuck
3 fucks what are you talking about
that 3 fucks
do you have any idea
how much i needed this
first you embarrass me by leaving me
and then you rub it in my fucking face
by getting it on with every single guy
in town you know youre embarrassing
im embarrassing
yeah
youre pathetic
you need to sign our divorce papers
you want pathetic no
not until you tell me why
really do you really not know why
because if i recall you didnt
touch me for like a year
and youre acting like a victim in
oh what cause youre so innocent
i had some sex
some
i may have over-compensated
oh yeah you think
you broke my heart
my fucking heart
asshole
sign the fucking papers
it the least you could do
so i have been thinking
about the orgy
the orgy cancelled
no im heather mitchell no one
cancels a social event on me
honey please will you just forget
about the orgy and come to bed
adam i am trying to figure out
a way to keep this orgy going
the last thing i have time for
right now is to have sex with you
why is it so important to you
to us it important to us
no it isnt i thought we were trying
to have a baby that the goal
and that is exactly why
the orgy is so important
what are you talking about
okay
look i
what
i dont want you to take this
the wrong way but
i had your sperm tested
it just weve been trying for a really
long time and i got tested first
and everything was fine
so it was the next step
what do you mean i didnt give you
any sperm howd you get my sperm
well when you make deposits
i make withdrawls
you
oh my god
okay
and
they said that you have the worst
sperm that theyve ever seen
we can get a second opinion
i got five
so you were using this
orgy as some sort of sperm bank
that wasnt the original plan
you wanted to get pregnant and then
trick me into raising
the child with you
with complete disregard for the fact
the kid would look nothing like me
i have to be a mother adam okay i
mean i wouldnt have married you if i
please go on
honey im just im being emotional
i would hate for heather
mitchell to ever have an emotion
i had to learn to love you
that came out wrong
did it
okay
you kept the tape
just getting rid of the rest
of my old junk before i leave
so youre youre going
well the whole town found out
my deepest darkest secret
so yeah im gonna go
everybody has bad
days apparently
and mine gonna get even worse until i
leave this shit-hole so if youll excuse me
what if you dont leave
well then ill have to stay
and everybody knows
im a fraud and a virgin
and i cant look anybody
in the eye ever again
youre looking me in
the eye right now
you know im pretty good at it
look
cassie when you left
town the first time
it was the worst thing
that ever happened to me
ive never forgotten about you
i think about you all the time
i mean the only reason that im
the only reason i married heather is
you know i get it okay i get it
you had to do what you had to do
you had to get out of town
you had to leave us all behind
you had to just go do your own thing
and that fine okay i forgive you
you forgive me
yeah yes i forgive you
you forgive me
do you have any idea why i didnt leave
town the second after that funeral
it because i thought you and your idiot
friends would be good material for a book
but youre not
youre just a bunch of sad boring
bumpkins who were born here
and will die here and
accomplish nothing in between
does becoming a bitch
count as an accomplishment
please leave i have packing to do
yeah im going thank you
what that for
it for you
it just weird youve
never done that before so
yeah
i thought it would be nice
okay you know you dont
owe me anything right
that im not some like little
girl whose feelings have been hurt
relax okay it was
it just a muffin okay
it not even a good one i
gave you the one that i dropped
i put my notice in
what what are you talking about
this town sucks it always sucked
so i am out of here i dont want
to become like my cousin heather
you know just settle for somebody
just because theyre there
you should do the same
or not i dont know
it not really fair for me to
say it i guess you do you
all i know is that leaving here
scares the shit out of me
and if youre scared of
something it worth doing
so i am gonna do that
anyway thank you for
the dropped muffin
jay macmaster and his wife

are you gonna tell
them or should i
what going on here
my money on gonorrhea
gentlemen the
the only reason that heather
wants to sleep with you
the only reason that this whole thing

-----NewMovie-----
hi my name caveh
and im about to be married
um this isnt my first time
ive actually been married twice before
um but im pretty sure
it going to be the last time
um
how can i know that for sure
i cant obviously
my last two marriages fell apart because
i used to have this sex addiction problem
and i dont really have that anymore
well at least not in the way i used to
um
you see about ten years ago i started going
to these sex addicts anonymous meetings
hi my name caveh
im a sex addict
all hi caveh
for me it all started in paris
about seven years ago
actually i wasnt able
to raise enough money to go to paris
so im just going to shoot it here
in san francisco
which is where i live now
so if you could just pretend this is paris
and that im 23 years old
so anyway i was walking
down the street one day
when i saw this prostitute
the first thing that struck me
was what she was wearing
but then i noticed her
uncanny resemblance to my wife
i thought it was strange that i should be
so turned on by this woman
and yet no longer the least bit
attracted to my wife
you fucking shut the fuck up
this is caroline my wife
how i ended up marrying her
instead of the person i was
really in love with is a long story
but i should probably start by explaining
that i never would have married caroline
if it hadnt been for the fact
that she was french
and that her visa was about to expire
actually let me back up a second
this is anna
she was my first real girlfriend
and the love of my life
we had met in college
and had been together for two years
now i should probably explain
that ever since i was a kid
i was obsessed
with finding my soul mate
every time i would meet a girl
i would think
is she the one
is she the one
or is she the one
i was constantly falling in love
at the drop of a hat
but the girls i was attracted to
never seemed to be attracted to me
things went on like this for years
and i was starting to despair
of ever finding a soul mate
and then i met anna
she had the most beautiful soul
of anyone i had ever met
and the two years we spent together
were the happiest of my life
it seemed that nothing
could ever come between us
and that we would always be together
the only problem was
that i was a philosophy major
and believed in free love
to me monogamy was a form
of private property
and i was against private property
let me try one more a different way
our role models at the time were
jean paul satre and simone de beauvoir
because they were said to have had
a polygamous relationship
which had lasted their entire lives
birds chirping
anna had had affairs
and so had i
of course we both got jealous at times
but we believed that jealousy
was something to be transcended
and that it was possible to love
more than one person at a time
beach music playing
which is how i ended up
becoming involved with caroline
we had met in paris
a few months earlier
and had spent three
idyllic days together
i know i said that we couldnt afford
to shoot in paris and we really cant
but the actress playing caroline
her visa expired and she actually
had to go back to france
before we could finish the film
actually let me back up a little
you see i had a really hard time
finding a french actress to play my wife
and then one day
i saw this woman on the street
who looked a lot like the real caroline
so i started talking to her
and found out that she was french
so i asked her to audition
caveh so what do you do for money
what your business
i have a make-up company
caveh oh really
are you a make-up artist
well actually
i teach people to do make-up
caveh really so youre
a make-up artist teacher
yes i am
now i should probably explain
that the real caroline
was also a make-up artist
which i took as a sign that i had found
the perfect person to play the role
but then a few months later
when we were about to do re-shoots
something really weird happened
okay something really weird
just happened
i was looking for a french prostitute
to act in the movie
for the prostitute scene
where is it
there it is
i found this face that says rebecca lord
so i open it
and im like
porn star rebecca lord french
and im like wow she looks
so much like caroline
i go down
im like she looks
so much like caroline
and then it says here
working first as a make-up artist
that what caroline was
and then it says that shell be visiting
san francisco august 7th through th
that when were shooting
our re-shoots
and im like wait a minute
caroline is a prostitute
and then there all these movies
here her list of credits
sluts of france
so i had inadvertently cast a porn star
to play my french wife
but anyway getting back to the story
we had met in paris a few months earlier
and had spent three idyllic days together
i had been totally honest with caroline
about my relationship with anna
and had even asked her
do you ever get jealous
to which she had answered
life is too short for that
i was blown away by her answer
and i found myself starting
to fall in love with caroline
but i still believed that anna
was the true love of my life
but then a month later
caroline flew to the states to see me
and it was then that the trouble started
you see
anna became jealous of caroline
and insisted that i choose between them
i didnt want to choose between them
i wanted to be able to see them both
but then anna got
a summer internship in new york
and caroline and i ended up
spending the summer together
which is why when her visa expired
i offered to marry her
so that she could stay in the states
now i should probably explain
that i wasnt exactly the marrying type
in fact i was totally against marriage
you see i had grown up
during the vietnam war
and i saw marriage as pat
of the same capitalist system
that had produced
the genocide in vietnam
explosions
screaming
but i was also influenced
by performance at
screaming
and by the idea of life itself
as a kind of performance piece
and to me the institution of marriage
was so inherently absurd
that i tried to subvert it
by treating it as performance art
i do
except that the joke
as it turned out was on me
because when anna found out
that i had gotten married to caroline
she didnt take it so well
phone slams
and then i did something
incredibly dumb
you see caroline and i were
about to run out of money
and the idea of having to get a job was
in my mind a fate worse than death
the only occupation i was interested in
was that of famous filmmaker
but the few experimental films
that i had made
hadnt exactly been greeted
with enthusiasm by the film world
indistinct
to remedy this situation
i had recently written a script
about the french poet arthur rimbaud
which i was convinced
would revolutionize cinema
and which caroline insisted it would
be easy to raise money for in france
it will be easy to raise money
for this in france
but moving to france
turned out to be a disaster
most of the film producers i approached
wouldnt even talk to me
the few that did
just told me that i was nobody
meanwhile my relationship
with caroline had started to unravel
crying
caroline was insanely jealous of anna
and would cry hysterically
whenever i would write her a letter
or talk to her on the phone
hi how are you doing
i was starting to feel trapped
and it was hard not to blame caroline
for having gotten in the way
of my relationship with anna
and then one day
i got a letter from anna
saying that she was going
to be in amsterdam
and asking
if i would like to meet her there
crying
i was ecstatic
i felt that i was finally being given a chance
to get back together with anna
but caroline knew that if i left
i would never come back
so she decided to jump out a window
the thought of being responsible
for her death
was way more guilt than i could handle
siren wails
caroline caroline
no no
grunting
so i agreed never to see anna again
it was by far the most
painful decision i ever made
but i did it because years
of going to sunday school
had taught me to equate virtue
with sacrifice
can i come down
man one more time
i should probably also explain
that when i was in college
i had once asked my friend arnold
coughs
what your like ultimate goal in life
and he had said
to be a saint
id been blown away by his answer
and i decided that i too
would try to become a saint
which is why
when caroline asked me
to cut all ties with the only person
i had ever truly loved
i agreed
ting
when i found out much later
that anna had gotten married
to someone else
i was devastated
i had still been secretly hoping that caroline
and i would eventually break up
and that anna and i
would one day get back together
but now i realized that it was really over
i tried my best to transcend my feelings
and to resign myself
to a life of quiet desperation
but the truth is i was incredibly angry
i was angry at god
i was angry at caroline
and i was angry at myself
but mostly i was angry at caroline
and then one day
i was walking down the street
when i saw this prostitute
there was something about her
that turned me on in a way
that i had never been turned on before
it was as if i had been hypnotized
and then i suddenly found myself saying
something that i had never said before
i said the words
now i should probably explain that i had
always considered myself a feminist
and had even marched
in an anti-pornography rally once
which is why
when i suddenly found
myself saying the words
i half expected the prostitute
to run screaming
gasps
or to slap me in the face
the fact that she didnt
but smiled instead and said
made my head spin
afterwards i was a nervous wreck
i couldnt get her out of my mind
caroline hi
hi
i thought that if i masturbated
i would get her out of my system
but it didnt work
so after several days
of compulsive masturbation
i decided that i needed a new strategy
you see i knew that she was
just a regular person
but in my mind i had somehow made her
into an image of erotic salvation
harp music plays
and it seemed that the only way to get her
off the erotic pedestal that i had put her on
was to have a real conversation with her
unfortunately she wasnt there
i was mad at myself for having wasted
so many hours of my day
but i didnt want to leave empty-handed
i asked that same question to every
prostitute that was there that day
i might even have asked
some of them twice
afterwards i felt strangely euphoric
and i returned home feeling that i had
finally gotten this thing out of my system
moaning
but i was wrong
instead of fantasizing
about just the one prostitute
i was now fantasizing about all of them
i went back the next day
and the next day
and the next
at first it was enough just to talk to them
and to fantasize
about them afterwards
moaning
but after a while just talking to them
was no longer enough
now i know that a lot of guys
in my situation
would have just gone ahead
and had sex with the prostitute
and not told their wife about it
but i had this thing about honesty
you see when i was a kid
my mother found out that my father
had been cheating on her
and made him drive my sister and me
to this other woman apartment
in order to humiliate him in front of us
i was too young to know what sex was
but i knew that it was a very bad thing
and that it was responsible
for my parents divorce
i was only eight years old at the time
but i began to hate my father
and i vowed to myself
that i would never be like him
crying
you know if you really need
to see a prostitute you can
i dont want to see a prostitute
i want to try to resist
but i think i need your help
what do you want me to do
i just need to be able to talk to you
i think if i can talk to you about it
ill be less tempted
and itll be easier for me to resist
you can talk to me about it
i can
of course
ohh
god i feel so much better
are you tempted to have
intercourse with a prostitute
or just to get a blow job
oh no just get a blow job
i would never want to have intercourse
with one that would gross me out
really
oh yeah
youre the only person id ever want
to have intercourse with
you promise
yeah i promise
is there anything i can do
to make you less tempted
maybe if you could give me
blow jobs more often
i dont mind
i can even give you a blow job
right now if you like
okay
i felt guilty accepting her offer
but i thought it might be a good idea
moans
i was still fantasizing
that she was a prostitute
but the fact that she knew
and accepted this part of me
made it different than before
it made it something we were sharing
something that we were doing together
and i felt that i was seeing caroline
for the first time
moaning
after i came i was still hard
this was something that had
never happened to me before
it was as if my no longer
having to repress my sexuality
had suddenly unleashed a backlog
of repressed sexual energy
so caroline offered to give me
another blow job
moaning loudly
to my astonishment i was still hard
so caroline offered to give me
yet another blow job
moaning loudly
afterwards i was still hard
i had never seen anything like it
and i actually started to get scared
i was afraid that my erection had become
permanent and would never go away
caroline offered to give me
yet another blow job
but i had recently
gotten a job as a film critic
and i didnt want to be late
to my first screening
on the way there
my erection finally subsided
at that moment i was filled
with boundless love for caroline
and i felt closer to her than ever before
as part of our newfound intimacy
i started pointing out to caroline
the women i was attracted to
i like that one
that one
she gross
not to me
i like that one too
youre kidding right
no im serious
she exactly my type
but she so vulgar
i know that what i like
about her it true
did you see that woman
i would love to have sex with her
it was great to be able
to be totally honest with caroline
and i felt that i was finally having
the kind of open and honest relationship
that id always dreamed of
whoa look at those lips
i would love a blow job from her
did you see that
but after a while
caroline couldnt take it anymore
what the matter
what do you think
im sick and tired of you
staring at other women all the time
it humiliating
what do you want me to do
you want me to hide the fact
that im attracted to somebody
how would you like it if you saw me drooling
over every guy i was attracted to huh
well id probably feel a little jealous
but id try to transcend it
i would
didnt you say you wanted me
to be totally honest
caroline
well ive changed my mind
but my not being able
to be totally honest with her
made me feel alienated once again
and i started obsessing about the various
women i would see on the street
i remember this one time
i saw a woman on the subway
that i was particularly attracted to
i dont know what i was thinking
but i suddenly started following her
for some reason i was dying
to reach out and touch her butt
and i was trying to get up
the courage to do this
when her boyfriend suddenly appeared
but i had been so turned on by her
that all i wanted to do was masturbate
the only place i could find
was a confessional
there was something
about masturbating in a confessional
that appealed to my sense
of transgression
and it wasnt long before i had masturbated
in every cathedral in paris
meanwhile caroline and i had
started fighting more and more
and i had started threatening
to have sex with a prostitute
in order to get her
to stop fighting with me
im going to go have sex with a prostitute
fine go get your dick sucked
by a prostitute see if i care
pssh
and then one day i somehow
managed to convince myself
that i was hurting her more by constantly
threatening to have sex with a prostitute
than i would by just doing it
and getting it out of my system
once and for all
i wanted to reach out and touch her butt
but i felt shy
i didnt know if that was allowed
water running
turns water off
moaning
uh
um
opens wrapper
i was certainly tempted
but i had every intention of resisting having
intercourse until she said the words
for some reason those words triggered
a chemical reaction in my brain
and it was suddenly as if i had no choice
im not sure why
but the fact that her delivery
was so unconvincing
just turned me on even more
moaning
there something i have to tell you
i know
you had sex with a prostitute
howd you know
i can tell
youre not mad at me
no im not mad at you
i think it was the right thing to do
because now ive finally
gotten it out of my system
i love you
i know just please
go take a shower
so tell me what happened
i told her the whole story
but when i got to the part about
the intercourse she got pretty upset
you had intercourse
yeah
but i used a condom
you promised you werent going to
i know im sorry
i tried not to but i couldnt help myself
she said the words rape me
and i just got really turned on after that
now i think i should explain that this was
especially difficult for caroline to hear
because she herself had been raped
i had hoped that being completely honest
would bring us closer together
but i had seriously miscalculated
i dont want to have sex tonight
i wasnt suggesting it
it not to punish you you know
i know
it just i need more time to get over it
i understand
take all the time you need
thanks
i was surprised at how little time
it took for her to get over it
moaning
it only took three days
after that everything seemed
pretty much back to normal
except for one thing
caroline started having fainting spells
caroline caroline
what the matter
i dont know
i dont feel well
we went to see several doctors to try
to figure out what was wrong with her
but none of them
could ever find anything
she perfectly fine
you know it been over two months
since weve had sex
if you want me to suck you
ill suck you
that not why im saying it
im saying it because i think
maybe youre mad at me
im not mad at you
i just havent been feeling well
okay
are you sure you dont want me
to give you oral sex
caveh i really dont feel well
okay
this went on for a whole year
during which my desire to have sex
with a prostitute gradually returned
i tried to escape my marital unhappiness
by throwing myself into my work
higher
i said higher
but i was unable to raise money
for any of my film projects
higher
what the matter with you
cant you jump higher than that
out of desperation i had applied
to film school back in the states
soon after we moved to los angeles
caroline confessed to me that she
had fallen in love with my friend gary
and then she fell in love
with my friend keith
and then she fell in love
with my friend teddy
a week later
she and teddy moved in together
and a year later they were married
this is the real caroline
i asked her to play herself in the movie
but she declined
i tried to stay in touch over the years
but after a while caroline
stopped returning my calls
i realize i havent made it seem
like i was in love with caroline
but the truth is i really was
as much as i was capable
of loving anyone
i mean i was only 26 at the time
after the break-up all i could think about
was finding someone to have sex with
hi can i get in
how much
how much do you want to spend
thirty
okay can i get in
okay
hi my name candy
hi im bob
nice to meet you
nice to meet you too
where are we going
pull over right here
can i have the money now
oh sure
um
do you have any change
no but if you give me 40
ill make it extra good
um
okay
look out for cops okay
moaning
bye
afterwards i felt euphoric
but by the time i got home
i felt empty and depressed
and i vowed never to have sex
with a prostitute again
but then a few days later
i found myself unable to stop obsessing
about that same prostitute
wanna date
it was becoming a pattern
every time i would have sex
with a prostitute
i would feel empty
and depressed afterwards
and i would vow never to do it again
and yet i honestly believed
that if i just did it enough times
my desire to have sex with a prostitute
would eventually go away
moaning
and then i met christa
i was walking down the hallway
at film school
when i saw her for the first time
hi
it was unusual for a woman
i had never met to say hi to me
because she did i assumed
she wanted to have sex
and then a few days later
i saw her again
excuse me
do you know
how to open these
i cant figure it out
i can try
here you go
it just twists off huh
you like capra
i love capra
hi my name caveh
hi im christa
nice to meet you
nice to meet you
so anyway she invited me to a party
she was giving that friday night
and i went
hoping to have sex with her
is christa here
yeah come on in
music playing
i failed to get her to have sex with me
but i did get her to lend me
a copy of her screenplay
it was one of the best screenplays
id ever read
and i felt that i had finally found
someone that i could relate to
i called her immediately
and asked her out
it was then that it happened
i looked into her eyes
and i saw her soul
until then she had just been someone
that i wanted something from
but at that moment i suddenly
saw that she was a real human being
with needs and feelings of her own
it scared the shit out of me
and then one night we were watching
vivre sa vie by jean-luc godard
about a woman who becomes a prostitute
you know what i heard
what
i heard that godard has
a prostitute fetish in real life
can you believe that
yeah
i cant
he seems so sensitive to women
well that doesnt mean anything
i mean im sensitive to women
and i have a prostitute fetish
youre kidding right
no im serious
i cant believe that
well it true
caveh how is that possible
i mean how can you justify that to yourself
well i agree it not
super spiritual or anything
but i dont think it so terrible either
caveh it like rape
those women have no choice
everybody has a choice
or else nobody does
i cant believe youre saying this
well it true
what are you doing
im sorry i have to leave
i feel like im going to be sick
why because ive had sex
with prostitutes
caveh you dont understand
i literally feel like
im going to throw up i have to go
christa
door slams
a few days later i saw her again
hi
hi
still feeling nauseous
no
sure you dont mind
being seen with me
stop it
im sorry i just felt like
you thought i was disgusting
i dont think that
it not like im still doing it
i know im sorry
i dont want to have to
hide anything from you
dont you want me to be honest
i do
caveh let make up
a few weeks later
it was my birthday
and i convinced christa to take
ecstasy with me to celebrate
okay
thank you
that night we felt closer
to each other than ever before
but ecstasy isnt just a love drug
it also a truth serum
i love you so much
i love you too
you do
i do
i dont want there to be
any secrets between us
caveh i dont
i dont either
can i ask you something
yeah
youll tell me the truth
yeah
there isnt anything that youve never
told me before is there
i can take it
yeah there one thing
what
ive been wanting to tell you
but ive been scared
caveh you can tell me anything
okay okay
sometimes when were having sex
yeah
i fantasize about other women
christa was devastated by my confession
and became hyper-sensitive
about other women
she would notice them
even before i would
and immediately scrutinize my face
for any sign of interest
it was unnerving after a while
so i tried to be upfront about it
she pretty sexy
she more your type
than i am isnt she
what are you talking about
and then one day i was on my way
to meet christa for lunch
when i decided to stop and get some gas
there was something about the way
the woman was bending over
that turned me on
hi im really sorry im late
caveh ive been waiting
i know im sorry
i had a little masturbatory episode
what
i had to stop for gas and
did you just say
a little masturbatory episode
yeah i had to stop for gas
and there was this woman who was
kind of bending over to put gas in her car
and she was really sexy
and i just got really turned on
at the way she was bending over
and i stopped at my apartment
so i could you know masturbate
but it was really no big deal
i just thought i should tell you
i just
i just dont want to talk about it
what about truth
i dont want you to tell me every single day
dont you want to know the truth
i already know these things
are happening caveh
i know you i know you
i understand you
and believe me
it will be much better with us
dont tell me
i dont want to know
okay fine
dont tell me
and then one night i happened to watch
a news program on massage parlors
vice investigators say
theyve recently found seven brothels
masquerading as massage parlors
police say these busts
are just the tip of the iceberg
and that many massage parlors
are actually fronts for prostitution
this is maya ellington
reporting for channel 3 news
want a massage
um
yeah um
how much
forty dollars for half-hour
um
does that include everything
that includes a half-hour
um
who gives the massages
different girls
are you one of them
no
um
can i see what they look like
no you have to pay first
get out of here
get out of here
im sorry
get out of here
im sorry
you get out of here
get out of here
i visited every massage parlor in la
at first it turned me on
just to grab the receptionists breasts
and get thrown out
but after a while even this
was no longer exciting enough
and then one day i had an idea
i think maybe the reason i havent
been able to get over my prostitute fetish
is because ive never really
gone all the way with one
what do you mean
greg was my best friend at the time
we had met at ucla and had made
a few student films together
i mean ive never really treated one
the way i do in my fantasies
which is how
which is pretty violent
like in my fantasies
ill grab whoever it is by the hair
and ill make her say things like
i wanna suck your dick and stuff
and maybe call her a bitch or a slut
and then start fucking her really hard
in the mouth and make her gag and stuff
interesting
but in real life ive never done that
why not
because i want them to like me
i see
so what im thinking is that maybe
if i went to a prostitute one last time
and just did everything
i always fantasize about doing
then i think maybe i could get it
out of my system once and for all
will they let you do those things
um
i assume
sounds like it worth a try
it is right
yeah give it a try
but i couldnt do it behind christa back
i mean i had to tell her right
are you serious
christa i cant keep repressing my lust
it not healthy
what do you want me to do
say okay
yeah
well it not okay
if you have sex with a prostitute
it over between us
christa please try to understand
it just something that i have to do
i cant believe youd be willing
to sacrifice our relationship
just in order to fulfill some sick fantasy
i have no intention
of sacrificing our relationship
id be doing this
to strengthen our relationship
christa how is this constructive
the last thing i wanted was to lose christa
so i decided to get professional help
caveh my mother had like
a phobia about changing my diapers
so she had like this aversion
to you know diapers
any recent dreams you can remember
um
i had this dream
where i was sitting on the toilet
and then i was getting
smaller and smaller
and then i fell in
i need you mommy
louder
i need you mommy
harder
i need you mommy
that it
i need you mommy
that it
i need you mommy
louder
i need you mommy
but none of it seemed to help
finally after weeks
of struggling to resist
i decided to do what i had been
struggling for weeks not to do
even if it meant losing christa
take off clothes
suck me
you give me money
oh yeah
um twenty now
and twenty later
if you do everything i say
no standing up
yeah
moaning
yeah
oh wait
first say i wanna suck your dick
no wait
first say i wanna suck your dick
no understand very good english
say i want to suck your dick
no understand
say i
no wait say ii
say i
ii
i say i
i say i
the fact that she had no idea what i was
saying took a lot of the thrill out of it
okay fine just suck it
moaning
oh yeah yeah
suck it yeah suck it you bitch
yeah suck it slut
yeah
moaning
oh yeah you love it dont you
you little slut
moaning
hold on hold on
um
stand over here
get over here yeah
moaning
afterwards the most
amazing thing happened
she patted me affectionately
on the butt and said
come again
i had gone there to express that pat
of myself which i was most ashamed of
and yet she had smiled at me afterwards
with acceptance and compassion
i felt that i had just had
a mystical experience
and that something inside me
had finally changed
that night i went over to christa
to tell her that i was ready to be
in a committed relationship
what do you want
i want to get back together
lock bolts
christa was understandably skeptical
about my transformation
but i eventually managed
to convince her that i was finally cured
now at this point in the film
there supposed to be a scene
in which christa is giving me a blow job
not a real blow job a fake blow job
but the actress playing christa
has refused to do the scene
do you feel like it domineering
or something to women
no it just something that im
not comfortable with doing on screen
could you please do it anyway
no
so if you could just imagine
that she giving me a blow job
and if you could also imagine
the following voice-over
and sex suddenly became very different
instead of fantasizing
that christa was a stranger
i tried to just be present
to what was happening
and it was overwhelming
i felt almost too loved
i couldnt believe that another
human being could love me enough
to actually want to take my penis
which i had always
considered ugly and dirty
into her mouth
or would be willing
to swallow my semen
hey sweetie
christa hi
i missed you
how it going
all right
why what the matter
there something i have to tell you
what
remember i told you i was going
to see a movie with robby tonight
yeah
well
afterwards
i couldnt help myself
and we started making out
what do you mean
you couldnt help yourself
i dont know it just happened
i wasnt planning it or anything
what do you mean by making out
we just like kissed and stuff
what do you mean and stuff
we just fooled around a little
and then what happened
im supposed to see him
tomorrow night for dinner
but im going to tell him i made a mistake
and i cant keep seeing him in that way
caveh im sorry
i felt incredibly jealous but i tried
my best to transcend my feelings
i cant do this
i feel like im kissing robby
i feel i can taste
his saliva in your mouth
well how do you think i feel
when you have sex with a prostitute
i could see her point
and i knew that i had no right to be jealous
after everything that i had put her through
but i just couldnt help myself
that night i called robby
at 300 in the morning
and i asked him as a personal favor to me
to please stop making out with christa
and he agreed
thanks robby
i really appreciate it
but he lied
they made out again the next night
you promised you wouldnt
i know im sorry
what were you thinking christa
i dont know
i just couldnt help myself
she was starting to sound like me
christa continued
to spend time with robby
and i just got more and more jealous
more and more needy
and more and more insecure
arguing
so we started going to couples therapy
so caveh
what are you thinking right now
i was thinking that im attracted to you
meanwhile our fighting
started to escalate out of control
yelling
and before i knew it my desire to have sex
with a prostitute had returned
how much
what do you want
how much for a blow job
50 bucks
let me think about it
after that night
i started cruising regularly
sometimes until dawn
and then i met devin
austin texas
fuck
i had been invited
by the austin film society
to show a film that
greg and i had co-directed
devin was one of the organizers
hey
that night we ended up
getting stoned together
and i found myself suddenly
feeling very attracted to her
coughs
and then on my last day in austin
we decided to take mushrooms together
tripping with devin was one of the most
mystical experiences of my life
i felt like we
understood each other in a way
that i had never thought possible
between two people
after we came down i told her the whole
story of my relationship with christa
you know i bet she
probably fucking robby right now
caveh youre crazy
why am i crazy
because you should be happy for her
you should hope she having a good fuck
you know youre right i should
you know i dont even
believe in monogamy
fuck man neither do i
it seemed to me that i had
finally found the soul mate
that i had been searching for all my life
ow what are you doing
you see there this person here
his name is caveh
he real he exists
you mean me
yeah i mean you
look as noble as it is to try to sacrifice
yourself and your needs for her
you have to be true to yourself
because youre real too
but the problem is i cant stand to hurt her
youre hurting her more by prolonging
a relationship that isnt working
than by ending it right now
yeah but im also scared
im afraid of being lonely and horny
and desperate and always on the prowl
i hate that
those dont sound like very good
reasons for staying together
youre right
sighs
i agreed with everything she said
but i wondered whether devin would
be able to accept my prostitute fetish
any better than christa
but christa really been trying
i mean im fucked up too
like for example
i have this prostitute fetish
big fucking deal
everybody got stuff like that
when devin said those words
it suddenly struck me that it wasnt
my prostitute fetish that was the problem
it was christa that was the problem
on the way back to la
i made up my mind
to break up with christa
we had been together for 3 years
this is the real christa
for the first few years after our break-up
we werent on the best of terms
but now things are better between us
she since gotten married
and recently had a baby
after the break-up
i couldnt stop thinking about devin
for the next month
i wrote to her every day
and when i received an invitation
from two european film festivals
i invited devin to come along
moaning
our first few days together were idyllic
but then things got more complicated
i think she likes you
caveh you think
devin definitely
i dont know she not really my type
not slutty enough
yeah right
you know if you want to see prostitutes
while were in europe feel free
you can just go
hey devin catch you later
and go and do your thing
you know i was thinking
about what you said earlier
and i just wanted to say that i really do
want to get over my prostitute fetish
you know i do
but it did occur to me
that maybe if i could get you to watch
while i had sex with one
that might be really healing for me
caveh that would be so intense for me
really
yeah it would
it just that like a lot of it
has to do with shame
and i think that if you were watching
then it would be something
that we were doing together
and then i think that might help me
to not feel so much shame about it
and then hopefully like i wouldnt feel
the need to do it as much
the next day we rented a car
and drove to milan to see
leonardo da vinci the last supper
hey a prostitute
do you want to stop
and check her out
i dont know
well if you dont mind
nah go for it
so what do you think
do you wanna watch
if it really important to you i will
thanks devin
i really appreciate it
she doesnt want you to watch
so what do you want to do
i dont know
let just go
okay
on our last day in italy
i saw the girl from the boardwalk again
her name was paola and it turned out
that she was an aspiring actress
she had seen my movie and liked it
devin hey
hey
howd it go
great she gave me her shoes
no way cool
yeah she saw my movie we kissed
you kissed lucky you
it was an okay kiss
not like yours
ohh
mm did you even notice
how i kept on riding
when you decided to go
and check her out
no i guess i didnt
yeah i just wanted to point it out
cause i dont think most girlfriends
would have done that
just take off and let you do your thing
yeah i guess youre right
id just like a little appreciation
cause most girlfriends wouldnt stand for it
let alone make it easier for you
yeah that true
thanks devin
yeah right
no i really appreciate it
yeah
but just do me one favor okay
what
just one
okay
just dont fuck her in our bed okay
okay
i was surprised that she would care
but i chose to be touched
rather than alarmed
paola had invited me to have a drink
with her and her friends that night
i had asked devin
if she wanted to come along
secretly hoping she would decline
but she didnt decline
i couldnt decide where to sit
i wanted to sit next to paola
but i felt i should sit next to devin
i decided to compromise
by sitting next to neither
thereby remaining equidistant from both
like christ in da vinci
the last supper
im going to head back to the hotel
ill see you later
dont you want to go swimming
no why dont you go
with your italian friend
id rather go with you
nah go with her
see ya
are you sure
you dont want to swim naked
yes im sure
no itll be fun
no
really
are you sure you dont want
to sleep together
yes im sure
but maybe when you come to torino
great ill probably be old by then
ill write to you
sighs
okay
and if ever you need someone
to act in one of your movies
just give me a call
that was the line
that made me hate myself
okay
i felt like a sleazy
hollywood film director
on the way home i had
a nightmarish vision of my future
i saw myself 20 years later
aging and still alone
by the time i got back to the hotel
i was feeling empty and depressed
all i wanted was to get into bed
and snuggle up next to devin
devin
devin
so did you fuck her
no i didnt
why not she wanted you
not enough apparently
well i almost fucked somebody
who
some dude that i met in a bar
here
sorry
i felt jealous and insecure
but i wanted to believe
that devin and i were engaged
in a high-minded experiment
in self-transcendence
the next day we flew to munich
groaning
fuck ive got such a fucking hangover
excuse me miss
can i have a scotch please
stewardess one scotch
yeah
i thought you had a hangover
i do that why i need a drink
is that a good idea
it the only way
it true
i know what im doing
okay
but this is my last drink
i promise
you promised you werent
going to drink anymore
well the guy kept buying me beers
i couldnt really turn him down
why not
free beers man
it was starting to dawn on me
that devin had a drinking problem
now i should probably explain
that the actress playing devin
had a drinking problem in real life
humming
laughs
the cause of and answer to
all of life problems
but getting back to the story
tv playing
devin stop it you said that was
going to be your last one
why dont you go fuck a prostitute
and leave me alone

i was starting to miss christa
that night i spoke
to every prostitute in munich
um
blasen
blasen
blasen ja blasen
after conversing with the street prostitutes
i made the rounds of the brothels
there was one prostitute
i found especially tempting
i was dying to have sex with her
but i managed to resist
and i returned to the hotel
excited to tell devin
that i had successfully resisted
the next day the film festival organizers
insisted that we pay a $300 fine
for damages to the room
and that we leave town
immediately after my screening
i am not having another drink
for a long time i can tell you that
well good im glad
devin had a bad hangover
and slept all afternoon
it was our last day in munich
so i decided to go sightseeing
music playing
cheers

what did she say to you
she was actually concerned
about me unlike you
she said come with me

and ill make you feel better
did she mean sexually
it all you can think about isnt it
well is that what she meant
im getting out
devin no wait
stop it close it
when we got back to the hotel
devin insisted on giving me a blow job
i told her i didnt want one
but she held me down and forced me
i was scared the whole time that
she was going to bite my penis off
moaning
the next morning we flew to new york
how much
let me pull it out for you
get down on your knees
im not getting down on my fucking knees
there broken glass
oh sorry
the next day
we went our separate ways
i wanted to say i love you
but i couldnt
but as i headed towards the gate
i felt able to say it and wanted to
but it was too late
this is the real devin
we remained friends over the years
and she later appeared in a film i made
called i dont hate las vegas anymore
by then she had already
been diagnosed with cancer
and had just undergone chemotherapy
she died three years later
on the way home
i felt an overwhelming sense of loss
ever since i had met devin
i had believed that i had
finally found the one person
who could accept me the way i was
but now i realized that i had been wrong
i had once read somewhere that
everyone who comes into our lives
is a mirror for something inside us
that were not seeing
so i asked myself
how devin might be a mirror for something
inside me that i wasnt seeing
at first i couldnt see it
devin was an alcoholic
i wasnt an alcoholic
but then it suddenly occurred to me
that even though i wasnt an alcoholic
i was kind of like an alcoholic about sex
caveh
yeah hi
hi
back in la i went to see a therapist
who suggested i attend
a sex addicts anonymous meeting
i scanned the faces of the other men
in the room for signs of perversion
but they looked just like anybody else
good evening my name is ken
im a recovering sex addict
all hi ken
welcome to the monday night male-only
meeting of sex addicts anonymous
this is a closed meeting
only those desiring
their own sexual abstinence please
in saa we define abstinence
not as the complete elimination
of all sexuality from the addict life
but only of those
compulsive sexual behaviors
that lead to pitiful
and incomprehensible demoralization
we leave it up to the individual to decide
which compulsive behaviors
he wishes to abstain from
i said that im a sex addict
are there any other sex addicts present
hi everybody my name sasha
and im a sex addict
all hi sasha
last week i finally took all my porn
and i just put it in a garbage bag
and i just hauled it out
cause i was just so sick of it
and i think of all the hundreds
and thousands of hours
im wasting in my car cruising
staying in sex clubs all night
when there absolutely nobody
that i want to have sex with at all
and it really started to affect
my work my marriage
everyone had a different addiction
ken was into gay bath houses
ron was a compulsive masturbator
and tom was a voyeur
but their stories
all had one thing in common
that the more they had
indulged their addictions
the stronger their addictions had become
im in my hallway and im bleeding
and i just realized that that it
im at fucking rock bottom
and i really need some support tonight
cause it been a really hard week
clapping
it 95 this is the time
we usually set aside for newcomers
would any of the newcomers like to share
yes
as you can see im not
very good at crying on camera
but i did actually break down and cry
at that first sex addicts anonymous
meeting that i went to
and i actually happened
to tape record the meeting
and this is actually the tape
that i made at that first meeting
this was in 99
and im just going to play it for you
so you can hear what it sounded like
caveh i feel really moved
by what everybody is saying
man what your name
my name robert
all hi robert
i didnt use my real name
blows nose
im blowing my nose
i used to be married and
it hard to talk
i started seeing prostitutes and
it destroyed my marriage and
then i got
involved with somebody else and
that just ended recently
crying
for the same reason
ooh i hit the record button
anyway that was uh
that was that
i mean there more but
let go back to the movie
i started going to meetings
regularly after that
and was eventually able to stop
having sex with prostitutes long enough
to get married again
unfortunately that marriage
didnt work out so well
two years later as our marriage
was falling apart
i had sex with a prostitute
and told my wife
she filed for divorce soon after
hi my name caveh
im a sex addict
all hi caveh
it wasnt easy
but after several more years of going
to meetings at least once a week
i was eventually able to stop having sex
with prostitutes altogether
it hard to explain
how i was eventually able to stop
it wasnt just one thing
but the way i think about it is in terms
of the story of orpheus and the sirens
the sirens were these mythical creatures
whose singing was so seductive
that anyone hearing them
would go insane with desire
sailors would fling themselves
overboard to try to reach them
only to die upon the rocks below
but when jason and the argonauts
had to sail past the sirens
orpheus the greatest singer
in ancient greece
came up with an ingenious idea
ting
he simply started singing
and because his song was so beautiful
the oarsmen had ears only for his song
and didnt even hear the sirens
and i feel like
that what happened to me
i heard a more beautiful song
and then i met mandy
hi
this is mandy
we just went swimming
we met in a dance class
and fell in love soon afterwards
weve been together for seven years now
which is by far the longest
ive ever been with anyone
caveh i love you sweetie
i love you too
now im not saying we never fight
mandy i was willing to talk about it
you werent
we fight a lot
now he in here and he filming me
but fighting no longer makes me
want to go have sex with a prostitute
or look for a new girlfriend
instead i just hang in there
and really try to work it out
exhales
i could go on and on
about how great she is
but the wedding about to begin
greg let do the boutonniere
are you ready
here we go
pachelbel canon in d major playing
man one two three
jonathan richman my baby

﻿
last night the faa was forced
to ground all aircraft leaving thousands stranded
when electronic failures
and mysterious power outages
crippled the western united states
but the big story today
the much-anticipated wedding
of fantastic couple
reed richards and susan storm
will take place this saturday
unbelievable bizarre anomalies
are occurring all over the world
defying every law of physics
and all the media care about
is what china pattern we picked
what did you pick the blue ones
with them little flowers i like them
excuse me would you mind
it happening again isnt it
yeah sure
no were not postponing
anything not this time
this will be the wedding you dreamed of
i wont let anything get in the way
not even the mysterious transformation
of matter at the subatomic level
that the most romantic thing
youve ever said to me
which is really pathetic
when you think about it
dr richards im very sorry
but were overbooked
we do have seats available in coach
okay here we go
smile
awesome
look mom
let me get one more
that should be fine
that my seat
sorry
excuse me
what if we get an endorsement
from an airline get us a private jet
i think we have enough
endorsement deals
that funny seriously reed it could
help subsidize your little inventions
no thanks
excuse me
consider it talk to you later
where are you going
i dont fly coach
i hope it rains
the snowfall came with no warning
and covered the pyramids
in 2 inches of snow
in japan some suggest
the solidification of the bay
was due to underwater
volcanic activity
though no such activity
has been reported in the area
scientists have ruled out
global warming
as the cause of the climatic events
being reported around the globe
with scientists unable
to explain the events
some are wondering
if the hand of god is at work
in other news reed richards
and susan storm wedding
has manhattan all abuzz
the guest list includes
many of new york power elite
hey honey
the city charging us for three
squad cars they say we destroyed
during that armored-car robbery
i only remember two cars getting thrown
reed
all right im putting it away
you were saying
i have a fitting in half an hour
the musicians after that
i havent picked out the place settings
or the flowers there too much to do
dont worry about it between
the two of us well get it all done
and what were you doing
when i walked in
inputting my to-do list
really
scout honor
hey guys
new uniforms showed up
what do you think
i think there no way
were wearing that
what do you have against capitalism
what this
just a little hobby of mine
yeah
would it make a good toy
or is it something science-y
a little of both
im both impressed
and disgusted at that
yeah sue says im addicted to it
i wonder why shed say that
hey johnny
keep it quiet but ive cross-referenced
and analyzed the global disturbances
theyre caused by cosmic radiation not
unlike the kind which gave us our powers
wow that really boring
listen i have a very important
wedding issue we need to talk about
yeah of course
your bachelor party
no seriously johnny
john focus-testing showed johnny
skewed a little young
seriously johnny no bachelor party
it just not my kind of thing
then do it for ben it means a lot
to the big guy youll break his heart
he does have some
sort of rock like heart
i have too much to do
before the wedding
i think sue might have
a problem with it
you know what sue
would have a problem with
if somebody told her
you were investigating
global disturbances
and cosmic radiation
instead of focusing on the wedding
like you promised
a bachelor party could be fun
yes
but no exotic dancers
this is it
i dont know anybody here
i would have invited your friends
but you dont have any
hey
johnny we had a deal
theyre not exotic dancers
theyre just hot
youre mr fantastic arent you
that so awesome
wow youre really cute
ill need a pitcher with
the biggest handle youve got
no problem
good evening

ms storm will be with your shortly
hello
thanks roberta
may i help you
were here to see dr richards
he not here can i help you
yes you can take me
to see dr richards
okay
sorry
when the universe began it was
no bigger than a marble then bang
it exploded
and in a trillionth of a second
it expanded exponentially into
what became the universe we know
wow youre really smart
thanks candy
that means a lot to me
i love this song wanna dance
no i dont
yes you do
honestly
come on youll be great
i dont want to embarrass you guys
just loosen up have some fun
that it
yeah
that it
guy really knows how to loosen up
youre not kidding
there he is
yes
unfortunately
for him
shall we
i think it might be clobbering time
sue what are you
general hager
let talk somewhere private
unless you need to do jell-o shots
off someone stomach
i was explaining to the girls
about how the big bang led to
this was johnny idea
i just went along
how does reed know the general
a few years back the guy was pushing
a new missile-defense system
reed testified that the
technology wouldnt work
im here on direct orders from
the joint chiefs of staff
personally i dont like sharing
sensitive information with a civilian
especially one who enjoys
the public spotlight so much
always a pleasure
to see you too general
what can i do for you
as you may know thereve
been unusual occurrences
officially weve downplayed their
significance but were concerned
these anomalies might pose a
credible threat to our national security
these were taken by one of our
spy satellites three days ago
what is it
we hoped dr richards could tell us
im afraid ive never
seen anything like it ben
i would say that it was a meteor
but the trail all wrong
it giving off its own energy
take a look at this
these have been appearing in
remote areas throughout the world
field personnel estimate its diameter
to be 200 meters
to find out what this is about we need
a way to locate and intercept that object
a sensor could be tied into
the baxter building satellite grid
we can pinpoint the location
of the object
good youll build the sensor for us
im afraid i cant
what
im getting married this saturday
i just dont have the time
richards your country
needs your help
call professor jeff wagner
he head of the
physics department at brown
i expected more richards
even from you
john storm
fantastic four incorporated
ever done any modeling
not interested
you got an amazing complexion
not interested
wow and you just walked away
i was definitely still talking
i cant believe you just turned down
a science project
they can build a sensor without me
the most important thing right now
is our wedding
no postponements no interruptions
thank you
and look about what you saw
back at the bar
dont worry about it i know you
im glad you had fun
thank you
besides
it was nothing compared to what
i did at my bachelorette party
talk about wild
wild
come on
hey what are you doing up here
nothing just needed some air
youre making that thing
for the general arent you
im guessing susie
doesnt know anything about it
dont worry my lips are sealed
that is they would be if i had any
look dont tell johnny

are you building that thing
no
if sue finds out youll get
an invisible kick in the nuts

surfboard-type thing
i know that sounds crazy
oh no not at all
did you follow the shiny man to
lollipop land or the rainbow junction
i know what i saw
thank you it all right johnny
whatever this thing is it has the ability
to convert matter and energy
so it caused the anomalies
it seems to radiate cosmic energy
when it exerts itself
randomly affecting matter
evidently this entity this
silver surfer
didnt want to be detected
it destroyed the sensor
it knew it was being monitored
and traced it back here
were dealing with something
highly resourceful
are you feeling okay
yeah i just i gotta walk this off
we must destroy it
before it attacks again
richards find me
another way to track it
sue i am so sorry
i didnt tell you because i
didnt want you to worry
im not mad you built the sensor
you did the right thing
oh great
i wasnt finished
okay sorry please continue
this proves what ive been saying
could you drop the force field

even our wedding
turns into world war lll
i know but once we are married
everything will be back to normal

as long as we do what we do
how could we possibly
raise a family like this
im gonna go check on johnny
johnny

switch powers with sue
id like to run more tests and

supposed to do in the meantime
just try to keep
your distance from us
you and me are gonna be spending
a whole lot of time together pal
my inside sources tell me
unlucky bride-to-be sue storm
turned in visible
and is staying that way
after yesterday
embarrassing fiasco
next the invisible woman
greatest fashion blunders
and an impromptu dance routine
from former scientist reed richards
why do you keep watching this
just ignore it
i cant ignore it reed
there no getting away from it
i believe there is
how
see no answer
yes there is
what if after this crisis is over
we leave it all behind
what are you talking about
we move out of the baxter building
ill take a teaching position
somewhere
get back to my research
the two of us will live our lives
and raise a family like normal people
you would do that
nothing is more important to me
than our future together
oh thank you
what about ben and johnny
theyll understand
besides johnny always
been more of a solo act
let not mention it to them yet
johnny got enough to worry about
as it is with his power problems
youve been busy my friend
your talents are impressive
can you understand what im saying
together we could be unstoppable
anything would be ours for the taking
all that you know is at an end
what do you mean by that
wait i said wait
theyre breaking up the team
reed and sue i overheard them
they want a nice normal
boring-ass life
no more fantastic four
well
what do we do
keep going just the two of us
and call ourselves what
the dynamic duo
when were they gonna tell us
theyll tell you when theyre ready
it their decision not yours
you cant be mad at them
for doing what makes them happy
guys
weve got a serious problem
i cross-referenced the surfer radiation
through every astronomical database
altair 7 rigel 3 vega 6
he been to all these planets
and now theyre lifeless
barren some even shattered
everywhere the surfer goes
eight days later the planet dies
how are we gonna stop him
we dont even know where he is
what about the craters
they appear in a numerical sequence
the last crater was formed
in greenland
so the next in the sequence
should be
latitude 5 degrees
30 minutes north
longitude zero degrees
seven minutes west
when he surfaces move the fight
away from the crowd
he too fast to contain
when i see silver im hitting him
you cant do that we stick to the plan
and work as a team
oh were a team now
news to me
what are you talking about
you know what
we were gonna tell you
when when you moved our stuff out
johnny this isnt a good time
kid got a point reed
you should have told us
that enough
well talk about this later
what the hell is wrong
with you people
it a whirlpool
oh my god

get out get out
dont let go

ben lift it higher
ill try

im bringing in help
bringing in soldiers and weaponry
will put innocent people in danger
no more than you already have
victor

you wont mind if i break your neck
let him go
you know who that is
victor von doom
he here under my orders
ben let him go
how is this possible

no thanks to you four
that for certain
von doom made contact with the
alien he got valuable information
information that might just
help save the planet
now let be clear about this
shall we i hate you
all of you
but the world at stake and we
need to work together to survive
general we know firsthand you trust
victor and youre gonna regret it
so far the only one ive regretted
trusting here is you richards
reed dont agree to this
let see what he got
i made a detailed recording
of our little encounter
all that you know is at an end
well
i like the part where
he knocks you on your ass
look at where the energy levels surge
when he attacks me
there see what happened
the energy was channeled through him
but it originated from his board
if we can separate him from the board
we can cutoff his power completely
that what we have to do
how
if i knew that
i wouldnt need you people would i
you two should
get started right away
im glad we have the opportunity
to collaborate again
ill try to talk slowly
so you can keep up
how can we be working
on the same side as victor
you got me things were simpler
when i could just whale on the guy
what he doing a fire
look at that
ill pay for that
ill tell you ben im starting
to feel like a complete screw-up
hey hey youre not
a complete screw-up
thank you
look kid it out of our hands
it up to the eggheads now
you think reed right about
the whole end-of-the-world thing
he never been wrong
about this kind of thing before
you know im not exactly
a deep kind of guy
really
but if reed right and this is it
how do you want
to spend your last few minutes
part of me would like
to go out fighting
but the truth is
id like to spend my last
couple of minutes holding alicia
that sounds pretty good
i mean not the holding alicia thing
she your girlfriend not mine
want nothing to do with her
not to say she not attractive
she very attractive
she so attractive
even with the i cant think of
a guy that wouldnt want to
what i meant
was that it nice
to have somebody
well you got me pal
how it going
i cant find a link
itll be all right
no it wont
the whole world
counting on me and i just
reed youre gonna find the answer
you always do
thanks sue
you just need to relax
yeah right

take a deep breath
slower
there you go
come on again
see i can already
feel your pulse slowing down
do you remember that time
a pulse
a tachyon pulse
i love you
im glad i could help
so exactly how does this thing work
when we activate the field
itll separate him from his board
making him powerless
like a fish in a net
yeah
yeah
in theory anyway
how long until it operational
three hours
three hours
i can only go so fast
since im working by myself
what do you need to make this happen
there are a couple of things
do your field engineers
have a beryllium casing
what are you doing
dont you knock
youre supposed to be helping reed
tell him not to worry
ill be there to hold his hand
and finish his little project for him
anything else
howd you do it
how did you come back
it scares you doesnt it
the things i can do
did you know i could create
a force field inside someone body
and expand it until they explode
give it your best shot
just get back to the lab
mr storm
were heading to intercept the surfer
in 0 minutes with or without you
were you waiting outside the bathroom
to try and catch me in a towel
that was a joke i was joking
why are you so down on me
you dont even know me
i know you very well
i read your personality profile
confident reckless irresponsible
self-obsessed
bordering on narcissism

i stayed in and studied
like a good little nerd

of the 2st century
im engaged to the hottest girl
on the planet
and the jock who played quarterback
in high school
is right in front of me

general
mr sherman
if youll excuse us
we have work to do
i want to be there for the questioning
not gonna happen
make sure our guests remain here
comfortably
yes sir
general what about the board
it in a chamber which
continuously scrambles the signal
there are certain things
im not permitted to do
because theyre considered
human-rights violations
fortunately youre not human
are we prisoners
how did that happen
apparently they dont want us
interfering with their methods
i cant imagine what
theyre doing to him
i say he gets what he deserves
how can you say that
im just saying maybe
the general right about this
the guy was about to destroy
the planet he said so himself
it doesnt make sense he protected me
from the missile why would he do that
maybe he thinks youre cute
there more going on
he said he wasnt the destroyer
maybe he lied
we need to get inside there
and talk to him
but under the radar
is there any way
we could get some dvds
or popcorn or something
ill call it in
great
thank you semper fi
that the marine corps
were the army

galactus
the devourer of worlds
it must feed on energy to survive
both thermal
and organic
how can you serve this thing
because i must
doesnt it bother you all the worlds and
innocent people youve helped destroy
my service spares my world
and the one i love

the alien to you as promised

your end of the bargain
you can do your tests on the board
but under armed guard
and in my presence only

general hager access granted

a jongleur even more
it is our last work for the evening
but we have beaubourg
the crowd

you hate the crowd i hate it
im wary of your contempt lionel
you are anti-cartoonist and in eight days you will praise the depth
you admire painters for their depth dont you
when i told you in paris that i hate comics
you have blamed me severely for using a viper language no
youre charming terry
cant you be serious
all these cartoons  france italy belgium
japan  even japan has caught up with america
shit
american culture is dead
our painting is dead our theater our music
our movies are dead
not your movies harry
no one is funding me anymore im dead a walking corpse
why do you think im in france damn it
ive also died
this cartoon is stupid
when i was a kid in arizona it was my passion
not seen for years
nobody is reading it anymore this t
it dead
snoopy that still has a spark of life
why didnt you invite charles schultz
harry take a decision for a comic book between a dog and a cat
would you like me to make a critical distinction
we invited schultz he refused
and will eisner another refuse
and al capp another refuse
it is dead
were all dead old man
this is what they said
in any case he wasnt free
we contacted crumb speigelman and trudeau
nobody
in america was free
let get the hell out too much smoke
i havent breathed fresh air from kennedy airport

no  you cant leave
you are joey wellman im gauthier
im fed up
you too  me too come
hepp catt is still spinning
you are so real
you are so good less  american
and final so hidden so cynical
i cant bear any longer your cynicism
you neither also of course
isnt it amazing
your work up to today although you are no longer 20yo
radiates the innocence of the american emigrant
the dreamer those who inspire hope
those who made hollywood
hi harry
christian gauthier  old scoundrel
good morning how are you
how i envy you for being a compatriot of the great joey wellman
do you know each other

outside their discipline
american artists ignore each other
woody allen doesnt know updike
mailer didnt know pollock
while they were neighbors neighbors
it not-amazing
it your motto isnt it
hello catt this to fatt catt
it-not-amazing enjoyable
harry is the great director a genius like you
who can forget your remakes have it or not
the public enemy and the train will whistle three times
unforgettable
i scrape the base plates
i machine-gun them and then i machine-gun the plate
hollywood vomits me do you know why
because my remakes are better
i havent seen them
of course not
who is less sticking than you artists
your famous individualism the anarchy each for himself
the establishment despises you
and you despise the establishment
it the secret of your genius come
did you understand not a word
but yes you understood
i invite my friends for a drink
no i have to wait for my daughter elsie
my elsie
joey  go ahead ill wait for her
your wife will be waiting for her bring her  her friends too

he likes what you do im going
bravo  i must say that you did very well
hush

because the only good in this country is that you can pay
paris for me is finished without appeal

in cartoons
sacrilege no no
take popeye the cartoon killed an awesome creation
oh my god
him who came from so far
for his exhibition
for you  to see you
and you treated him
as you dont treat even your worst enemy
i dont have worse enemy
im still too young
in the meantime ill do the trick
he was never a father to me
he was protective for everyone
for this woman he lives with
but for me never
he is more paternal towards strangers
dont throw the invitation you can change your mind
stop harassing me
hell leave without ever knowing
how much you have changed
without ever knowing how far away cleveland is for you
without ever knowing how much
you parisianized yourself  francized
christian gauthier

joey wellman
who has only read illustrated books
ronald reagan despite all his faults
narrow-mindedness filthy ignorance repugnant racism
will go down in history
as the greatest president since truman
and truman from lincoln
the american one hundred percent
for me the greatest president
was franklin roosevelt
no wrong
roosevelt was a great actor like reagan
america decline began with roosevelt
roosevelt was a great man
he did nothing for the jews of europe
in france we understand that
roosevelt was a romantic figure like de gaulle
truman was more in the populist vein
man in the street
you know nothing about american politics
truman has done more than roosevelt
i admire your propensity
to be deaf to everything so agree on nothing
i met truman once
president
he had no idea who i was
i thought you were the author of krazy kat
this come-in-the-bacon from truman
so
truman
arrived at this dinner with others
large vegetables and they introduce me
my young friend he said to me
there are too many cats in your illustrations
put a republican mp in your comics instead
for me a republican
it much funnier than a cat
for me a republican is funnier than a cat
it the stroke of the pencil that so striking
for a cartoonist hepp catt of course
vaguely resembles a cat but
does mickey looks like a mouse
donald  to a duck
however a mouse is a mouse
and a duck a duck
i much prefer daffy to donald
disney was a better strike breaker than a designer
no no disney had a tragic vision
dumbo that ridiculous baby-elephant with wings as ears
even you must have loved it
i hate it
and his mother  poor dumbo mom has gone mad
we had to chain it
chain it what about bambi mother
shot down by hunters by cowboys
not by cowboys
dejected
lena worked for disney
im speechless
draw us a bambi
no
but if but no
i never drew bambi  so
lena what let make an effort
sorry i never did that
joey please
joey draw us a bambi
no i dont know
what has he said
he asked me if you could draw miss piggy for us
toddlers lionel and i
we disguised ourselves as comic characters
you were showing off in grotesque disguises
but me no
come on joey
you are dressed up as a pig
slander
next week im getting organized
the immortal motto
i was sure i was sure
lionel
tonight let organize a comic strip ball
in honor of joey huh
what an excruciating idea
elsie

my daughter  remember
we waited for her in your car
and there she is
excuse me
this is my thesis
we waited for her all night and she was there
joey your life is a real comic
draw me popeye no wimpy
ill pay you with delicacy on tuesday

no wimpy it too simple
ill implore you bugs bunny oh yes
lena does this much better than i do
no no well done joey very well
what did your mother say
that youll have to draw her a drawing
every time you come to see her in france
you cant disappoint us
they understand me in paris unimaginable right
there going to be a costume ball in my honor tonight
awesome
no one has ever spoken to me like you
if only i
i didnt have a mother after dad left
she hated me
youre welcome no secrets
i was an orphan
an orphan when you left us
father and daughter so alike
both so sad
i thought you werent
my son brings me all kinds of americans
directors television fantasists philosophers
boredom
what do you want me to do
i must defend myself
christian loves women but
they dont count for him
he doesnt think about it until one or two in the morning
there christian remembers them
but at 8 oclock in the morning
he forgets them all
he only remembers  his books
lena im recognized here
no one has recognized me with us since 96
i have never been considered as an artist
unbelievable right
why do you suddenly need to be an artist
i feel bad with these people
why are you doing this to me
i thought you liked france
have you seen my wife
you tarzan
you jane
the americans never  understood me
im what i am and that all i am
obviously woody allen is taller than bergman
dont be so stupid lionel
it not-amazing
i invite you to my home for an all-duck dinner
youll bring the duck
joey
as a jew are you with woody allen
for a palestinian state
because  im looking for my daughter
have you seen my wife
why do i have to be titi
courage elsie
i dont want to be titi
you have to learn to be strong
but why
if you dont have the strength you have to be ironic
in life you need one or the other
strength or irony
are you strong
or cynicism
strength irony or cynicism
i want to die
the despair
despair will do just as well
excuse me
im looking for my daughter
harry hates the court you get
he a director right
youve never heard of it
oh he would cringe
can you help me
well  make you the big game
harry was highly  listed in france
how does he give to the actors
all these indications
famous men attract me
you have something on your costume
but i have no repairing marks from you
are you very famous
are you a celebrity
or are we just playing the big game for you
i could have loved you you know
i tried
im not even sure i love your father anymore
spielberg doesnt shoot films but comics
it shouldnt bother you
blablabla comics
why ban comics
there is no longer a bit of energy in the american movies
i counted twelve murders
and an ax-fight in your last movie
energy was still flowing there
it does in violence
because there is no other theme
except for the french
france knows each other in love
america knows nothing about that
rape perhaps but not love
you are crazy harry crazy
you americans
you love your deficiencies
the french love those of others
when i want to see a train station i go to the musée dorsay
when i want to see a museum i go to beaubourg
have you seen elsie
after 2 years with the frenchies i know the picture
a third of the day work
another third sleep
and on the last judge others
basic principle with frenchies
be wary of their hugs
fabulous country if you are an artist
but what a band of cow skins
have you seen my wife
where can we find something to drink here
no
elsie
what are you doing here
and you
i was close and
and  the couch
me too
and  something  below  or above
me too
what did they say
didnt you hear
she asked mr gauthier if he likes americans
and he said
he said
that he didnt understand why an american as bad as you
may have been asked to come to france
did he say that
he said he and his friends are making fun of you
they dont like the americans who play to be european
did he say that
no no he didnt say that
what did he say
he said he likes you
it looked good to me
and he said that i am a monster
he didnt say that
yes exactly
and he right doesnt that remind you of anything
at three years old you locked yourself in the entrance hall
and you invented things to scare you
like there now
it not true that exactly what he said
when i found you i was tenderly trying to get you out
but you were dragging me inside with you
we would sit in the dark
and i would tell you stories to reassure you
it not true
and  i remember  i invented
i invented  this little cat for you  sally catt
i was telling you stories of sally catt
and you asked me again and again
you used to be unhappy
and sometimes you didnt say why
but you were taking me to this cubbyhole
and you were telling everything  to sally catt
i dont believe it  it a lie
you have never been nice to me
this is remarkable
it in french
it is still remarkable you are 9 right no
20 out of 20
mr gauthier hasnt read yet my thesis
he wont read it dad
and
oh you are
im your father

it normal isnt it
if im lucky enough to have a child

you really think
they drove two
and a half hours
just for the day
baby
i know you had
this weekend
all planned
okay and it
really sweet
but your dad here
and ive never met him
and i think
it just weird
to run away
itd be weirder to stay
and hang out with him

how do you know that
did you see
a hint of regret
on his face
when i said
we were leaving
no he wants us to go
so
hope im not
interrupting anything

thinking that
if you really wanted to
maybe you could

if you really wanted to
vicky is probably
gonna start cooking

really embarrassing
when it happens in public
it a no brainer
was that um an opera
yeah it that song
from pagliacci

a problem though
what are
you gonna eat

going to sleep
im sorry he
pulled that shit
what shit
there is no reason
for him to act that way
he not a teenager
sometimes
people get stuck
in patterns
i mean who
behaves like that
youre right babe
why did you have
to put butter in
their food anyway
are you kidding meno im not kidding
we could have avoided
the whole thing with them
how was i supposed
to know they
didnt eat butter
because i told youyou said vegetarian
what the hell
is the difference
and you could have
consulted me
before you invited
them to stay
in the first place
it one night baby
well ive had
a wonderful evening
but this wasnt it
yeah exactly
i dont know
i mean
it kinda crazy here
interesting

i dont want to have
this discussion right now

everybody if you dont
you never even tried

to be great so
i just found
the canoes
the kayaks

he loves it
he talks about it
all the time
that youre the only one
that knows how to do
an alaskan roll
alaska roll is sushi
an eskimo roll
yeah yeah yeah
it been a while
maybe you can stick around
and just give a hand
ive never done it before
and since youre the master

i would like to see
some mastery yeah
we could do
a little class
yeah i dont think
i am qualified
to be an instructor
i didnt bring
a bathing suit
i mean it just
it just the basics
come on
i think we can
change our plans
right
come on
i
i think we

change the tickets
you just want
to keep the rhythm
pretty even
so you dont tip
the boat inadvertently
like this
yeah that it
how do i make
this thing stop
my god okay
it not a car
it doesnt have
water brakes
yeah im sorry no
when seth was a kid
he was pretty good

yeah he had
pretty good control
hed zip in and out of
the rocks and the rapids

see every leaf
on every one
of those trees
moving individually
i mean look at that
how many leaves do you
think are on that tree

your final answer well it just a guess

it very precise
a real man of science
i just cant
believe that you
you own all of this
yeah
right
like all of this
it likeyou ever been
up here before

no way

a really big deal
for him

of the time we
were here hiding
from me in that
tree fort of his
i was just beginning to
feel like i got all the
grime off from the lake

ticks lyme disease
bed bugs

neglectful father
i get it
you know what
come to think of it
im not surprised that
you took his side
really and what
side is that gil
and what side is that gil
enough with the questions
you know what
you are right
im just gonna sit here
and enable you
to transfer responsibility
onto everybody else
but yourself
all right
with the analysis
it ridiculous

he is an adult
we are both adultsno you are the father
gil act like it
i made an appointment
what
when why would
you do that
without talking to me

of all this
there is
no more time gil
time up
honestly i dont know
if i can
take care of
any more people

up in the tree house
sethhe almost got pneumonia
he gave you the
tree fort story
with the flu and the
yeah that a classic
and you fell for it
im sure
i wanna do this with you
and i know you
wanna do it with me
so why are you
so worried
cause i dont wanna
end up like this
like whatlike you and seth
it not one of
those decisions
you can just make and
change your mind later
im not changing my mind
no one changing
his mind
you sureim sure
you know
he used to sit there
on that rock
when he was a kid
for hours practicing
and if he even thought
you might be listening
he would stop immediately
and wait for me to walk away
i dont need another
screwed up family
neither do i
you checked for ticksticks

checked for ticks

you for ticksyeah

silver onethe one we looked at

what this means like
hey if you

this is a lentil dal
indian kind of thing
and then
so
what on the menu
there a lentil
tomato thing there
then there
some greens
your work now is gonna be
this ratatouille inspired
vegetable thing
that what im making
youre just grilling
the vegetables
ill add them later but
it better when you grill
the vegetables first
did you learn all this
at those restaurants
you worked at
yeah
did you like it
i hated it it was awful
i can imagine
well it a good thing
you dont have to
do that anymore
i do
every now and then
i just pick up a shift
when im a little short
seth i must say
im impressed
and gil and gil
i hope you realize
that organic quinoa
sauted tofu corn cilantro
no animals no additives
it one of seth
signature dishes
i know
i helped him make it
we didnt tell you
we put extra butter in yours
just for you
im sorry all right
im sorry
im sorry
ill get that
i have
a question
um what derby
you guys kept saying derby
we were on the
housatonic was it
class four water
class two at most
it was big
wherever it was
seth did a roll
and he came out of it
and then i did a roll
then he did a roll
then i did a roll
and then at some point
seth said it like
a roller derby
and now that
what you say when you
come out of a roll
derby
drove my sister nutsshe was just jealous
of the boys
here we gono you know
it interesting
i was reading
an article
and this evolutionary
biologist had this theory
about why men
are generally
drawn to sports more
the biology articles
that he reads
are in maxim
no but it
interestingwhat did it say
the article was saying that
there a difference
in the evolution of the
male and the female brain
basically dating
back to like hunter
and gatherer times
and men were drawn
more to activities
that allowed them to
exercise their judgment
of spatial dynamics
like throwing a spear at
a buffalo or whatever
throwing a pass
to a wide receiver
they had to judge
all these different
spaces and times
and hit a moving
target just right
and so women
are really good at
finding the tomato
in the refrigerator
because were gatherers
makes perfect sense
there might be some
basis to the fact
that our brains
are different
just because all men
seem to think that way
no seth is this true
seth claims women
dont know how to
step out of the wind
what did you claimi didnt
claim anything
honey
yeah maybe you should put
that in one of your songs
you know i saw you
down there today
you should play them
your new song
it it really good
i havent performed
that one yet
yeah but itll be
the perfect opportunity
yeah well after dinner
if youre up for it
maybe we can get
a private concert
i dont know i mean
i only have a guitar
and it isnt
it not
i read that review
of yours in the voice
you didyeah your dad
showed it to me
it was a well
written review
he was like a little boy
showing off his report card
okay now when
i get back tomorrow
i will take you over
there and you can
pick out a new one
any one you want
all right
all right it getting
past your bedtime now
so here your mom
good night kid
hi sweetie
no no more computer
games tonight baby
i love you sweetie
now go to bed
gil said that um
i should open this
so
gil

the fire is for
turn up the thermostat
here sit here
it closer it warmer

this persnickety
no
i think these
wide open spaces
sort of
make me nervous
the city just tricks
you into feeling like
youre not alone
i dont think
youre alone
what do you want
what do you mean
is this some sort
of exchange
where you let him
fuck you and he helps
provide for your kid
fuck

im just holding it
your breath
smells like wine
i can have a glass
of wine if i want gil

of your life
that it
forgot to bring
the bug spray

you know
ill take my chances
you know what works
really well
standing next
to a womanwhat
i dont
know what it is
but their blood is
different or something
but women are like fly paper
did you ever notice that
i dont know
every time im with andie
she complains
about getting bitten
yeah seei only do when
im by myself
pretty soon thatll
be the only advantage to
a heterosexual relationship
i like andie by the way
a lot
me too
you like vicky
yeah
but
nothing
were thinking
of getting married
really
it a 97 barolo
by the way
how old is the kid
he eight
who is the father
not me some doctor
i dont know who
you wouldnt know him
you like himthe kid
he a nice kid
congratulations
so where is
he this weekend
jake is with his dad
that crazy
i mean it not
crazy but it just
you know i i never
would have guessed
well
i had him when i
was younger than you
would it be okay
is it is it weird if
i asked you what happened
with your marriage or
no
what happened
what didnt happen
you want my professional
or my personal opinion
i want professional
okay um
where do i start
michael and i
we were
madly in love
we thought that that
meant we were strong
and we decided
to have a child
and it the most
amazing thing
starting a family
but you have to create space
like literally
create space
so all of a sudden there
this little person and he
sleeping in bed with you
it like adding
another lover
sounds like seth dream
hey there
it can be
there just so much
that changes that you
could not predict
before you have kids
you know like
you cant give each other
the same amount of love
it weird like your
love gets divided
we werent
prepared for that
and i think we just
couldnt accept that
there was some part
of our relationship
that died
and then resentment
sets in and
you get the picture
wow
that your
professional opinion
that my
professional opinion
what your
personal opinionhe was an asshole
no im serious
it was like one morning
he just rolls over
and says i dont think
i am ready for this
for whatexactly like
we already have a son
you know what there
to be ready for
sorry
i didnt mean tono
youre not the
jerk that left
is that why you went
for like an older guy
because hed already
been through his
mid-life crisis
i guess i am his
mid-life crisis
what comes after
the crisisno i i
i hadnt thought
of it that way
see this is
youre selling the house
so you can take care
of vicky and the kid
not that simple
long vacations
pay for tennis lessons
you never cash
the checks i send you
i dont need
your money
you didnt seem to
mind taking it to
pay for college
so this is how you
try to make up for it
make up for what
how things went with
your first family
why would you say
something like that to me
what do you
want me to say
you sound just like
your mother
god i am so sick
and tired of being
criticized judged
i just want to enjoy
the rest of my life
did it ever occur to you
you might be happy for me
there wasnt room for
everyone in that family
im different with vicky
i can
relax
actually feel good
she listens to me
there isnt a whole
life of mistakes
and guilt between us
why do we have

yee-haw
whoo-haw
whoo-haw
hyah hyah
whoo-haw
yee-haw
but it been six weeks
since the surrender sir
how long must our boys remain
in your prison camps
we cant just
turn them loose mr cole
we have to arrange
transportation food--
then arrange it sir
by heaven had the victory
been ours--
when may i see
general good
ill tell him
youre here
excuse me
captain martin
right this way
the general
expecting you
captain martin sir
captain im a busy man
so ill get right
to the point
i have a job here
i think may interest you
this chest
is all that left
of a million-dollar
gold shipment
lost at phantom hill
one of our patrols found it
right about here
20 miles
from phantom hill
and the gold
from that chest
and 9 others like it
is hidden out there
somewhere
how do you know
the gold
never reached
the confederacy
general
we have
general lee word
and he is an honorable
man captain
here take
a look at that
joseph henry barlow
he was one of the rebs
at phantom hill
a few weeks after the raid
he was captured
he knows where the gold is
he finally admitted it
but what more important
he agreed
to lead us to it
why
because we have something
he wants
it all in there
before the war
he was serving
a life term in prison
for murdering
a federal marshal
in texas
i see
and in exchange
for a pardon
he volunteered to join
the reb army
that right
but now the war is over
we could send him
right back
to prison again
but we made
a deal with him
the united states
government will recognize
that reb pardon
if he leads us to the gold
there just one thing you
forgot to mention general
phantom hill is right
in the middle
of the staked plains
and the staked plains
are part of the territory
the government
just gave to the comanches
and under the treaty
the army is forbidden
to set foot in that country
that why this meeting
is unofficial captain
that why youre to forget
this conversation
the minute you leave
this office
and that why provided
you accept this assignment
youll be completely
on your own
and if anything
goes wrong
the united states army
and the federal government
will deny
they ever heard of you
what would i do for men
and supplies
this will buy you
all the equipment
you need
as for men
youll find them waiting
for you at hays city
well do you
want this job
captain martin
you know i do sir
yes i know you do
im very sorry
about your brother
he was a fine officer
we lost a lot of good men
at phantom hill
well at least i hope youll have the
satisfaction of completing his mission
thank you sir
good luck
oh captain
dont forget
barlow is a killer
look away
look away
look away dixieland
i wish i was in dixie
let get out of here
excuse me excuse me
oh
when are you gonna
let me out of this thing
when im through
with you
ha ha
just relax
youll be a free man
in a couple of weeks
free yeah
but it aint gonna be
like i figured it would
well a man cant have
everything barlow
a man can try
oh hey come on back
the war over
you gotta come back
big boy  laughs
he got away
hey what
going on there
stop the train
youre right handy
with a shooting iron
aint you
dont try that again
barlow
i dont want
to have to kill you
not yet anyway
that right
not yet anyway
well let not worry
about it till
the time comes huh
meanwhile you still
got your hand
and i still aint got
no holes in my hide
so no hard feelings
huh captain
no hard feelings
all right

mr martin
im adam long
i think you two
know each other
well i guess
you could say we met
we didnt take time
to introduce ourselves
that day
at phantom hill did we
im joe barlow
i guess you understand
there was nothing personal
in that roughing up
we gave you
how many men
do you have
with you long
there four of us
only four
that right
where are they
krausman and orourke are
down at the livery stable
dr hanneford
at his hotel
dr hanneford
that right
we havent any use
for a doctor
i was told
to ask for volunteers
i wasnt told
to reject anyone
all right have the men
at the livery stable
at 830 tonight
yes sir
let go
sheriff
hi charlie
sit down
forget it barlow
anybody ever tell you
you got a mean
and suspicious nature
yep
and no sense
of justice either
none at all
it aint like
i stole the gold
it was captured
by the confederacy
legitimate spoils of war
that what it was
only there aint
no more confederacy
so i got just as much right
to that gold as anybody
including the united states
government
it might pay you to
think about that captain
who is it
open up
it sheriff drum
what this
you signed the register
matthew martin
is there a law
against a man
giving his real name
is it
it is
where you from martin
depends on
where i was last
this man
a friend of yours
what difference
does it make
it might make a lot
of difference mister
i might have
to take you in too
for helping
an escaped convict
get your hands up barlow
now wait a minute--
hold it
maybe you dont
remember me reb
i was a guard at the federal
prison in austin texas
when you started serving
a life sentence
for the murder
of a us marshal
so that the burr
under your saddle
well thisll set
your mind at ease sheriff
it a full pardon
from the governor
of the state of texas
given to me in exchange
for volunteering
to serve in the army
of the confederate states
of america
hey
the us government doesnt
recognize any reb pardon
what do you mean--
joe
sheriff there must be some
way of working this out
there nothing to work out
i got a pardon
relax joe
just relax
look sheriff do you have to
make an issue out of this
the war over
why not let bygones be bygones
i still dont like rebs and i dont
want them around my town
well then
you got no problem
joe and i are pulling out first thing
in the morning for santa fe
santa fe
yeah that right
were uh were starting
a freight line there
all right
all right im gonna
do you boys a favor
you be out of hays city
by 700 tomorrow morning
and ill forget
i ever saw you
dont forget
700 in the morning
that was easy
too easy
when you men volunteered
for this mission
you were told your
destination was santa fe
well that not true
were going out
on the staked plains
well i can see youre all
familiar with em
why in the devil are we going
to that land of satan
were going after gold
orourke
$ million in gold
that the united
states government
lost to the rebs
at phantom hill
and mr barlow
gonna lead us to it
captain the staked plains
are 00 miles--
00 miles inside the new indian
treaty lands doctor i know
that why were going
as civilians
if the army was caught
violating the treaty
it could lead to a general
indian uprising
so once we leave here
were on our own
from now on i want you
to forget youre soldiers
if we get picked up
by a military patrol
well be considered
deserters
if were caught
by the indians
it our funeral
is that understood
krausman orourke
i get it
one more thing
youll all wear sidearms
i--
that includes you doctor
like me youll each carry just
two shells in the chamber
since we wont be able to keep
mr barlow under lock and key at all times
he might be tempted
to appropriate somebody gun
if he did he might be able
to kill two of us
but thatd leave him with an
empty gun and three men
six bullets
still against him
i want us on the road
by 700 in the morning
put a little lift
into it now lads
ah you wouldnt have
a wee spot
for the bite of the snake
in there would you doc
all right

a nice trip to santa fe
thanks sheriff
you know martin
a man does a favor
he kind of expects
a favor in return
doesnt that
seem fair to you
depends

$50
look that the only well
in 00 miles of here
git-up git-up git-up
oh
anybodyd pay $50
for a barrel of water
could only be headed
one place that i know of
like maybe
the staked plains
i wonder
what theyre after
i dont know
but whatever it is
must be mighty inviting
sure does arouse
a fella curiosity
wait a minute
you been here three days
eating and drinking
what about your bill
oh
i got more
than this coming
you didnt mark
the graves
no
i just walked the horses back
and forth trampling the ground flat
hard to tell where
your brother buried
he came
a long way to die
tell me about it adam
didnt you read my report
to general good captain
i read it
then you know
the whole story
i dont know
what the convoy
was doing here
almost 00 miles south
of its original route
the comanches were at war captain
so were the rebs lieutenant
your brother wasnt to blame
for what happened here
i hadnt thought he was
we gonna camp here
tonight
no
weve still got an hour or
so of daylight well move on
yes sir
there your staked plains
out there captain
a misplaced piece of hell
if there ever was one
how much further barlow
well that hard
to tell
we sorta lost track
of things after we left here
what with that wagon full of
gold getting heavier and heavier
and the men and horses dropping
and the sandstorms scouring us raw
where krausman
he was here
a minute ago
captain
krausman what--
still warm
comanche
0 2 ponies
headed south
straight for
the plains
im gonna ride up ahead
take a look around
keep moving for another hour
then make camp
id like to ride
with you captain
ill bet you would
if im not back by morning
break camp and keep moving
youre not to waste any time
looking for me or waiting for me
that an order long
shouldnt somebody
go look for the captain
you volunteering doc
leave him
alone barlow
i was just asking
a question memphis honey
after all the doc here
must be quite a guy
considering all the men
he says he killed
tell us about it doc
barlow
i want to hear about it
howd you kill em doc
it was very simple
mr barlow
i worked in a slaughterhouse
the army called a hospital
and when they brought the
wounded in by the thousands
i chopped off their hands
and feet and arms and legs
and i bandaged them up
with dirty rags
and i stood there and watched
them bleed to death
or die of gangrene or shock
when the war started
i was a surgeon
and when it was over
i was nothing but a butcher
you call me a doctor
but im not a doctor
not anymore or ever again
maybe things aint as bad
as you think they are doc
i mean
if you had some money
and could go someplace
like say california
take a nice long rest
forget about the war
then maybe someday youd feel
like starting all over again
when you come
right down to it
we all got something
ailing us
but you take a million dollars
even split five ways
that mighty powerful
medicine
aint nothing in the world
that wouldnt cure
what about the comanches
theyre out there
all right
i dont know how many
but theyre there
so until we know where they are and what
theyre up to were gonna keep moving
pull up orourke
whoa boys
whoa
whoa
heavy cusses
aint they
that cause theyre airtight
to protect the gold
we dumped em
to lighten the load
didnt do much good
couldnt have been more
than 0 or 5 miles
before the horses give out
and we had to hide the stuff
all right
let make camp
you know
i been thinking about what you
said to the sheriff back in hays city
how youd be back someday
and make him
and the whole town
come crawling to you
to apologize
anybody with
half a million dollars
could make hays city sit up
and bark like a dog
youd like that
wouldnt you
id love it
all you gotta do
is get me a rifle
first chance you get
after we pick up the gold
why not
there it is
there it is boys
hyah hyah
hyah hyah
look at the gold
just look at the gold
unbelievable
all right
let get it loaded
well captain i did
my part of the bargain
now you keep yours
when the job done
barlow
it done
your amnesty will be recognized
when we get to fort hays and not before
how do i know you yanks
wont back down on the deal
and send me back
to austin prison
because you were told
when this gold is returned to
the army youll be a free man
now if youre in a hurry
get to work
gold always was
my favorite color
are you coming
what the matter
afraid ill hide one
in each stocking
well hello again
just bring it
right on down here
you know a fella eyes play
tricks on him out in this country
sees things that aint there like
running water green grass trees
i even seen a herd of buffalo
once that werent there but
i never did see no gold
that gold
is as real as real
drop them gun belts
all of you
do as he says
i wouldnt do that mister
one shotll bring every comanche
within five miles riding down on us
maybe there aint no comanche
within five miles
well then all you gotta do
to find out is pull that trigger
no comanche ever heard
a skinning knife at work
orourke
move the wagon up
let get
that gold loaded
gonna leave them
for the buzzards too
that right doctor
captain
it empty
dont look
at me captain
i get just as thirsty
as anybody else
how much
have we got left
well there only
the one barrel left
and it a third gone
let me see
that map
i dont suppose
youll believe this
but there a water hole
about 50 miles north of here
you sure
of that barlow
im alive aint i
of course im sure
that the way
we went
must mean eagle wells
do you know it
it was on
our original route before
before we decided
to turn south
here eagle wells
there another water hole
30 miles north of that
sabine springs here
sabine springs
all right let get that gold
loaded and move out
adam
what is it captain
barlow down at the picket line
he saddling a horse
let go get him
no im gonna follow him
see what he up to
i want you to keep your eyes
on things while im gone
you didnt have
to come after me
i would have
caught up with you
who buried there
we didnt have time
to carve his name
and without shovels
we couldnt dig too deep
but here lies major armiston
dead by reason of snakebite
what about the others
did the same snake
kill them too
i told you i dont know
what happened to em
a couple of them took off on their
own and i got separated from the rest
i kind of liked the major
he and i got along
real good
and i was curious
if the comanches
had found his grave
theyd as soon scalp
a dead man as a live one
and you came
this far out of the way
just to make sure
yeah
start digging
huh
you heard me dig
with my bare hands
you buried him that way
didnt you
now dig him up
you satisfied
im gonna tell you
just one time barlow
from now on
stay with the wagon
captain
im just played out
both of us im afraid
drink some of this
no
drink damn it
that an order
thanks
help him
into the wagon
ooh ooh easy boy
let go doc
forget the saddle
krausman just take the gear
captain
ill take care of him
well travel afoot
for the next hour
that aint too healthy
captain take a look
they see us
leading our horses
they might get the notion
were too far gone
to put up
much of a fight
yeah and the only
sure way i know
of bringing em buzzing down
around our necks is to make a run for it
so well walk
how far to eagle wells
ought to make it
before sundown
i figure the least theyll do
is try to cut us off
that not their style
of fighting
just waiting
for what
well know
when the time comes
now we know why they werent
in any hurry to cut us off
this hole
been blasted
and not just
recently either
i may be
wrong barlow
but somehow i get the impression
youre not entirely surprised by this
nor much
concerned either
are you accusing me
lieutenant
because if you are
let me remind you again
that i can get just
as thirsty as anybody else
i went through that once
three days of no water
it aint something
i wanna do over
put that thing away krausman
put it away
all right break it up
you heard me break it up
is there any chance
of getting the horses
to sabine springs
theyll pull no more
without water captain
we must be facing it
tis the end
of the line
im thinking
not yet orourke
not yet
just coyotes
ha ha
what are you doing
up here
youre supposed to be
on the north ridge
what good would i be
up there without a rifle
you can yell cant you
now get up there
barlow right
those arent coyotes
no theyre not
but remember this weve
got rifles and a clear field of fire
those comanches will have to
think twice before they do more
than just squat there
barking at each other
yeah and what happens
after they think twice
you were in love with that sheriff
in hays city werent you
that farewell speech
you made
the way you looked at him
and he looked at you
what right
do you have--
tell me about it
you go to hell
tell me
all right captain
yes i loved him
then a young lady
came to town
oh she was a very
respectable young lady
with a very
respectable father
who was the president
of a very respectable bank
and that when
carter drum
decided to clean up hays city
starting with me
now is there anything else
youd like to know
about memphis
whatever-her-name-is
memphis
what the matter
anything adam
no
barlow oh
what you trying to do
youll get yourself
killed sneaking
up on a man like this
anyway youre not
supposed to be out here
i thought maybe
you was thirsty
whiskey
oh
oh tis a miracle
that what it is
where did you ever get it
brant
what in the devil
you been saving it
for man
oh
captain i got
one of them spotted
im gonna work down
from here and cut around
behind him
here you keep me covered
forget it
were not here
to collect scalps
i got 7
of em 7
i swore it on anna grave
and the baby
i said 0 scalps for you
anna and 0 for the girl
they still owe me three
that all i want
that all
i come here for
now you
keep me covered
krausman krausman
now you
listen to me
we got just one chance
and that getting
to sabine springs
you help us get there and you can
kill 20 comanches for all i care
you promise
yeah
but all i want is three
just three more scalps
i am not saying i will
and im not saying i wont
what i am saying is
i need another drink
no you dont
barlow heh
im on to you
trying to get me drunk
and make away with my rifle huh no
me trying to get you drunk
look if youve had too much
just hand the bottle back
let forget all about going partners
well i didnt say that
im turning it over
in me mind
oh it that dry
my mouth is
what happens
if they attack captain
they wont
not tonight
not tomorrow
not till we get to sabine springs
and find it been blasted too
blasted
how do you know
why didnt they try
to cut us off today
because they knew
the well was dry
why havent they hit us
tonight
because they know when we get to
sabine springs it wont help us either
well what are you
gonna do
im gonna get the truth
out of barlow
if i have to use krausman
scalping knife on him
then it a deal
it a deal
and i have your word
barlow
there will be plenty
of water for all of us
why did you
why did you
up here doc
stay with her adam
keep under cover
get out of here
go on
go on
get out of here
get out of here
get out of here
adam what the blazes you doing
drop your rifles
drop em
now the guns
you first
left hand
krausman
stand over there
beside him lieutenant
he was on top of me
before i had a chance
it my fault
not yours
you wasnt
much help to me
was you
memphis honey
but maybe
it wasnt your fault
now you think you can
pick up them guns
without getting a pretty little
finger caught in the trigger
try it
how far do you think
youre gonna get barlow
just dont you fret
about me captain
by the time the comanches
get finished with you
ill be on the downhill
side toward home
now the canteens
what good
are they gonna do you
there not a drop of water
among the three of them
i know
but there nothing
like leaving
a tidy camp behind you
that fine
now climb on
you better go with him
come on come on
come on
you can count on
better treatment from me
than a dozen
buck comanches
them comanche
must be mighty curious
about what been
going on up here
this ought to
really stir em up
all right let go
come on
hyah
adam i want you to build a fire
a big one
are you crazy captain
we gotta get out of here
now how far do you think were
gonna get afoot without rifles or water
right now we got only one
chance and that the comanches
barlow invited them in now
let make it easier for em
get that fire started
krausman you come with me
hyah
you all right captain
i can make it
i got the horses
let go
krausman
krausman captain
let get out
of here adam
whoa
yes sir
im gonna really
live it up
reach me one of them
canteens will you
memphis honey
i got a lot
of living owed me
two years of prison
four years of the war
and that stinking
prisoner-of-war camp
ahh
you know honey
i almost forgot
what a woman
voice sounded like
but you sure
fixed that
so i see
hyah git-up
we better get off
and rest that leg captain
were not gonna be able to go
much further without water captain
well make it
weve got to
i gotta tell you
something
i gotta tell you about
your brother captain
why he changed our route
what do you mean
jim was out of his head
he didnt know
what he was doing
hed give one order one minute
and contradict it the next
he shouldnt have
been in command
i should have taken over
then why didnt you
because i was scared
and i didnt have
the guts to admit it
that why i left it on my
report to general good
i was protecting myself
were you
were you protecting
yourself
or were you protecting
a friend
dont waste it
waste it
memphis honey you just dont seem
to understand do you
we got nothing
to worry about
here make
yourself useful
water them nags while
i fill up the canteens
where the other canteen
what canteen
we had three of em this morning
now there only two
where the other one
how should i know
youre lying
all right big man ill tell
you where it is
it about five miles
behind us
now you listen to me
dropping that canteen
was stupid
say martin gets away
from them comanche
say he finds a canteen
say he comes
out of this alive
what then
you looked appetizing
enough to him out here
but back where a gentleman
like him comes from
he wouldnt walk across the street
to spit on you if you was on fire
stop fooling yourself
memphis
youre trash
youre trash
just like me
only difference is
im rich trash
and youre poor trash
but it dont have
to go on being that way
you just say the word
you can have the whole world
right here
memphis honey
all you gotta do is remember
what you are
we lost em captain
the wind must have
covered their tracks
warm some more rocks
the principle
of condensation adam
for the same reason
dew forms at night
cold air striking
a warm surface
warm rocks
against the night air
result moisture
and maybe enough water
to keep us alive
water
tight as a canteen
couldnt take much water from the
first grave but here he really loaded up
farsighted man
mr barlow
first he kills
the officer in charge
then he talks the others
into following him
hide the gold till after the
war then well all be rich
gets the men to fight
amongst themselves
then he fills
the chests at eagle wells
and sabine springs
blasts them dry against
any possible yank pursuit
all the time he was burying
his own private water supply
against the day
hed return
let me see
that map adam
here the first grave
then eagle wells
now this one
and there sabine springs
straight on line
dead north
dead north
and with that wagon barlow gonna
have to take the long way around
i think weve eaten
his dust long enough adam
let beat him
to the next one
hyah hyah
come on you can dig
as good as me
right here
come on
dig they gotta be here
go ahead dig
you can dig clear to china
but you wont find any water
where the others
theyre here
yeah
why dont they
show themselves
krausman
lieutenant
so it come down to you and me
huh captain

from now on ill always
be one jump ahead of you
grave by grave youll
find nothing but sand
you stay here
all right
you know what to do
be careful
all right captain

and ill throw lead
matt

most of his grave anyway
the lady helped
considerably

in which my client suffered
irreparable psychological
damage to her self-esteem
oh and she keeps

look where i come from
guys make mistakes sometimes
didnt change the fact
that i loved you
i just know
i wouldnt do it again
because you got caught

im not the only guy in the
world that ever screwed up
even a goody-goody like jack

the united states
miiitary airfieid here
the hijacker
who was disarmed by us air force personnei
was taken intoamerican custody
aiong with a woman and a chiid in his company
us officiais said eight other passengers
aii east germans

mr
laeuferwiii be taking you to a west beriin refugee center
theyii give you identification papers money
theyii heip you find a job
a piace to iive
what about heimut
weii not yet with heimut
it a bit more compiicated
on behaif of my daughter
marina radke
i hereby reiease and forever discharge the united states government
we are aii signatories to the internationai accord against hijacking
inciuding west germany
for god sake
that agreement requires prosecution or extradition back to the east
to face prosecution there
it poiiticai suicide for the west germans to do either
what the heii do they put in their coffee around here
so bonn wants out
you bet they want out
we are in one heii of a bind
we have to prosecute
state has a mess
and justice must ciean it up
a courtroom
yes
and bonn is paying for every naii
everything
theyre paying us to prosecute the case for them
but uh whatwe need
is a reiiabie judge
as director offoreign iitigation
maybe you couid heip us find one
according to this report
there was a judge
weii he baiied out
ieft us hoiding the bag
mm-hmm
with three defendants in the bag
theyve been in custody
for months
the east is demanding either their heads or their bodies
we have to deiiver something ifwe
want them to protect our civii aviation
from other such excursions
to cuba for instance
yeah yeah yeah
you said reiiabie judge
you knowwhat i mean
bruno
atough no-nonsense judge
possibiy a former prosecutor
look we need this thing
overwith-one two three
does anybody
spring to mind
good morning judge
bruno weicome aboard
did you take your shoes off
i remembered
iii be rightwith you
yankee doodie went to london
just to ride a pony
i am thatyankee doodie guy
oh my
marsha wouid iove this
i didnt reaiize the justice department had a maid service
thank you
itwouid appear esteemed judge
that youre the one who been cieaning up
six mayors and uh--
eight
weii who counting
what is it a coupie of state secretaries
two state treasurers
extortion bribery fraud
you shouid have had a sign over your door-abandon hope
aii who iitigate here
youre not such a bad prosecutor
do you miss it
what do you think
theyve been in the custody ofthe united
states that iong without a triai or a hearing
the man stiii is
the woman and chiid were reieased due to
iack of evidence but are confined to west beriin
pending what
history
since the iron curtain
no one has ever stood triai for escaping from the east
but hijacking is different
nowwere taiking about
internationai treaty agreements
which by the way we have just signed
with aii the internationai attention
so no one wants
that day in court
we certainiy dont
and we occupy west beriin
the west germans dontwant it
so it heads we iose taiis you win
so why dont they do that
just toss a coin
they did we won
we did
the chanceiiery has had a very persuasive influence on the white house
this wiii be the first such united states court for beriin
aii the procedures
wiii beamerican
as wiii the iawyers
and the judge
you caii that
winning the toss
of course esteemed judge
we have you
youii become an articie two judge with fuii dipiomatic passport
this couid mean a better shot at the supreme court
how much time you figure
no time at aii
case is open-and-shut
this man heimut thieie
confessed to everything
he was quite candid in his statement
heid back nothing he was proud of it
he was giad
to be iocked up
are our prisons so much better than their streets
i want to discuss it
with marsha before i agree
thereii be no piea bargaining
you know how i feei about that
do i know how you stand on that
oi gevait
this was aii we heard in iaw schooi
how does it go
accept piea oniy ifthe scope of a punishment
afforded under the piea is adequate to meet the nature ofthe crime
never bind the judge hands
in advance
what did bruno say
he said he sorry
he missed you
that very sweet
what did the man say
it an open-and-shut case
shouidnt take any time at aii
couid be iike a second honeymoon for us iove
he said the weather in beriin is beautifui this time ofyear
i think it very beautifui right here in new jersey
ah what do you know
youve aiready made your mind up havent you
yes i have
mm-hmm why
if it an open-and-shut case
where the chaiienge
this couid mean a iot to me marsha
oh herbert herbert

we can do about it
may i
cigarette
russian
no french
foreign ministry
uri davidovitch andreyev
assistant to the first secretary for security
internationai department
ofthe party centrai committee
im flattered
your east german comrades
must think me very important
to run to the iong apron strings of mother russia
i suppose that they might
these forgeries
are remarkabie
are you in the business
of arranging defections
my name is hans schuster
im an eiectricai engineer empioyed by a construction firm
that does business
on both sides ofthe waii
i met sigrid radke
in february of 977
we feii in iove
the fact thatwe iived in two differentworids was an inconvenience
i sought to overcome
i was to secure for sigrid
and her daughter
counterfeit
west german id passes
rendezvous with them in poiand where
thanks to the faise ids
we wouid aii board a ship bound for bremen and the free worid
obviousiy

iike you waiting to go on triai
that cant be true
no one has ever been tried in the west for escaping from the east
correct theamericans wiii do it for us
theamericans

oh no in aii fairness
to the free worid
we shaii iet theamerican court estabiish your sentence in their triai

very carefuiiy
the waii herr schuster
iffour meters high
and 60 kiiometers iong
you are in
the construction business
you know how--
you know how expensive
that can be
one of my duties is to make sure aii that money doesnt go to waste
in that sense i too
am in the construction business

engineering escapes
then your stay here
wiii be indefinite
herr schuster
piease beiieve
there nothing personai
in what i teii you

prosecution and defense
judah best for the man
thought youd be interested in the woman counseior
bernie heiiring
sixweeks they had
radke and the giri
sixweeks with heiier working on them day in and day out

yet the moment
radke is reieased
she comes bouncing back
eager to turn herseif in
with a carbon copy ofthieie confession on her iips right
right

are you prepared to demonstrate there is probabie
cause to hoid the defendants on these charges
i am your honor
very weii you may caii yourfirstwitness
coionei patrick heiier
can you teii us what
your investigation has shown
regarding what happened on the piane before it ianded
the airpiane was iocated 5 minutes
from schoenefeid airport in east beriin
when according
to his confession
heimut thieie made his way
to the gaiiey
grasped the hair ofthe stewardess
beata levandovska
piaced a pistoi
to her head
and forced her to the floor
ofthe aircraft
he then toid the crew that ifthey did not iand in tempeihofairport
he wouid shoot the stewardess
coionei heiier isnt it true
that from august 30
to september 0 978
sigrid radke was heid
against herwiii
and without benefit of counsei on your orders
objection
that is immateriai to the statement made on november 28
when she came in voiuntariiy
to set the record straight
sustained
mr heiiring you wiii piease confine your
questioning to the statement on november 28
isnt it true coionei
that the oniy shred of evidence
you have against mrs radke
is her own statement
since none ofthe passengers on the airpiane actuaiiy saw her do any--
i object mr heiiring
is ieading the witness
your honor
every singie passenger on that piane was interrogated
i think the question demands an answer
i agree overruied
piease continue mr
heiiring thank you sir
iii repeat the question
isnt it true that the oniy evidence you have against mrs
radke
is her own statement
yes i wouid say that
isnt it aiso true
that mrs radke toid you
that she had begged mr
thieie not to go through with the hijacking
and that actuaiiy she
attempted to prevent it
objection your honor
overruied
the witness wiii piease
answer that question
she did say that
yes she--
what sigrid radke may or may not have
said to thieie on that piane doesnt matter
the point is
she did use her own daughter to smuggie a gun onboard
and she did hand
that gun to thieie
then she did nothing whatsoever to warn the captain
the crew or the passengers
that a hijacking-ahijacking-was about to take piace
im inciined to agree
with you mr sherman
butwhether or not mrs
radke attempted to withdraw from the scheme
is a matter to be decided at a triai
not at this preiiminary hearing
anything further
mr heiiring
no your honor
nothing further
does the government
wish to reexamine
not at this time your honor very weii
the witness may step down
ladies and gentiemen
at this time
the court ruies that
there is probabie cause--
excuse me your honor
mr best
yes your honor
um ive been advised by my coiieague frau becker
that there is here in beriin a perfectiy
vaiid constitution very simiiar to our own
simiiar in its protection
of individuai rights
but it doesnt provide for the specific eiements
of due process as we understand them
in particuiar the right
to a triai byjury
my ciientwouid iike to know at this time
if he wiii have a triai before his peers--
citizens of beriin--
as guaranteed by
theamericanconstitution
uh mr best i can oniy assure you
as a federai judge--
excuse me
your honor excuse me
mr chairman i beiieve mr
paimerwouid iike to respond to that now
mr paimer
may i approach the bench your honor
you may mr best
im sure your honor wiii appreciate the reiuctance
with which we approach this compiex question at this time
but i do not beiieve thatwe are actuaiiy bound by iaw
to extend those rights
mr united states
attorney
it is the farthest thing from my mind to embarrass you or your ciient
but notjust the defense
but aii of us-the counsei the court the peopie--
are entitied to know the iimits
ofthis court authority
your honor--
excuse me mr paimer
is it the government position that the constitution ofthe united states
appiies here fuiiy
or something iess
were not prepared to give a definitive position on that issue sir
we wouid argue in an american court-im sorry
gentiemen
were not having an argument on this today
be seated piease
we wiii next proceed
to arraign the defendants
and reconvene here next monday morning to set a firm date for triai
adjourned
open-and-shut case
piece of cake
shouidnt take any time at aii
right bruno
iii provide the entertainment from here on
hey that
mariene dietrich
greatest iegs-ah second greatest iegs in the worid
i dont hear anything
oh from continent to continent
some things never change
heiio
yeah bruno what up
what the heii you mean
no jury triai
the united states authority
in beriin is derived
from rights of conquest
not the consent ofthe government
so in otherwords
the citizens ofwest beriin have no rights at aii
the united states court for beriin is
an instrument ofthe occupation poiicy
ofthe united states
the decision whether
to grant a jury triai
is a poiiticai
and not a judiciai question
dont iook at me judge
i didntwrite it
so who did write it
adoif hitier
the decision whether
to grant a jury triai
is a poiiticai
and not a judiciai question
this as i understand it
your honor
is theposition
ofthese prosecutors
for the united states
ofamerica
i have been abie to find
oniy one iegai precedent
for theirposition
your honor
it is the case caiied
cat versus mouse
from a foreign
jurisdiction
from the casebook caiied aiiceadventures in wonderiand
a cat named fury said to a mouse that he met in the house
let us both go to iaw
i wiii prosecute you
come
iii take no deniai
we must have the triai for reaiiy
this morning i have nothing to do
said the mouse to the cur
uch a triai dear sir
with no jury orjudge
wouid be
wasting our breath
iii be the judge iii be the jury
said the cunning oid fury
iii try the whoie cause
and condemn you to death
for shame
that i shouid even have to
rise to respond
to such aposition
on behaif of our country
a position written by peopie somewhere in some foggy bottom
with some pretty foggy heads
i ask the court to ruie
notjust for our ciients
but for the honor
of our country
that these fugitives from another sociai system be at ieast entitied
to due process ofthe iaw
in thisamerican court
we do not understand the confusion on
the part of the defense over this matter
weii this court is a iittie confused too
mr paimer
this court sits--
this court sits in conquered territory
it is an occupationai court
therefore it stands to reason that it is
an instrument ofamerican foreign poiicy
it cannot by definition
independentiy decide anything
so in otherwords
this court must foiiow
the directives
ofthe us secretary of state
in otherwords myjob here is to simpiy obey
i have nothing to decide
not on the question
ofthe jury triai no
sir are you teiiing me
that the constitution ofthe united states does not appiy in this court
it is ourposition
thatwere not restricted by the united
states constitution in these proceedings
that is correct
did you ever hear anyone say that to anyjudge
in an american courtroom anywhere
i have not
two us government prosecutors one a biack
the other a jew they sound iike nazis
what the heii
going on here
did you know this
wouid be an issue
i didnt
anticipate that no
do they reaiiy expect me
to do the same thing
that nuremberg prosecuted aii those
german judges for doing here 45 years ago
you heard em bruno they want me to be a good boy
foiiow the fuhrer orders
and ruie the defendants in my court are no
more than a mere extension offoreign poiicy
they want me to become
a goddamn nazi judge
they can go to heii first
knowwhat im gonna do
im gonna do what those german judges shouid have done in 934
im gonna resign
they can get somebody eise to do their dirty work
herb iisten
if a jury of beriiners
is brought in to judge a case in which the united states is a iitigant
then the conquered
are judging the conquerors
and our status as an occupying power is at an end
and beriin
is a free city
then the yogurt hits the fan
because the russians wiii be here the next day
now aii i am saying is that this is not good guys and bad guys
this is the state
and paimer and sherman and in the
unenviabie position of representing the state
in what seems to be
an inhumane poiicy
you work for the state
how do you stand
in this instance
i support the decision
ofthe court
and that decision
is mine aione
some honeymoon
weather in beriin is beautifui this time ofyear
im sorry
im just trying to understand what drives these peopie
what the heii is it
look at this
my god
that actuaiiy happened
seventy peopie have been kiiied
and more than 3000 arrested
trying to cross
that godforsaken waii
now i have to sit in judgment
on two that made it
how the heii can i do that
especiaiiy with the state department breathing down my neck
teiiing me they have no right
to a jury triai
herbert you have
made your point
this case isntjust
a chaiienge anymore
it has gone so far beyond that
and im getting scared now
why dont you iet somebody eise finish it and resign
dont think im not seriousiy considering resigning
but i have to wonder--
whatwouid have happened if eari warren
stopped defending the constitution
before schoois in the south
were integrated
what ifjudges iike frank johnson
ofaiabama and bob merhige ofvirginia
hadnt fought
for equai rights
they firebombed merhige house
and he stiii heid firm
who am i to waik away when the constitution in jeopardy
come off it don quixote
those guys were fighting for civii rights
youre risking our entire future here for a coupie of germans
so that it
you want me to take out the hoiocaust on them
buiishit that is not the point at aii
yes maam
that is not the point at aii
that is the point marsha
you want me to bury these peopie to
make up for aii our graveiess reiatives
let me teii you something
my soie responsibiiity here is to uphoid my oath to the constitution
and not to any government poiicies or personai causes
mr paimer wiii you piease
approach the bench
sir this court
rejects out of hand
any notion that these defendants
have no rights here
and uniess and untii a different united
states judge for beriin presides here
the constitution wiii remain in fuii force and effect
your honor--
im caiiing your biuff
mr paimer
ifthe occupationai authorities do not bring
a jury of beriiners into this courtroom
im going to be forced
to set these peopie free
you know i--
i aiways thought itwouid
be different here in the west
hans was aiways
so optimistic
it is different here
not perfect
but at ieastwe can try
to make our system work
countries dont care
who they hurt
what is the difference between one system and the other
when you have nothing
im sorry
i know you--
youre reaiiy a very good man and youre
trying to do everything for marina and me--
piease sigrid iet me do it
let me show how you were tricked into making your confession
no
dont you see that
these russians are here
theyre in court they see everything
they iisten they watch
there no hope for hans
ifthey know how he heiped us
it bound to come out sooner or iater
okay but not through me
it our oniy defense
sigrid
then i have no defense
i wouid rather go to jaii forfour orfive years than to hurt him
butwe
piease you respect that
dont know that it
four orfive years
we couid be iooking at a sentence of 5 years
doesnt matter
oh for god sake
save me from stupid
seif-sacrifice

wiii it keep her company
for 5 years
wiii hans want you
to do that
i dont know
i just dont know
you wanted to see me
yes thank you
your newspapers here--
how accurate are they
surprisingiy accurate
id say
especiaiiy regarding
this particuiar triai
so i can beiieve that sigrid has not so far brought up my name
her siience may be
an attempt to protect me
that an act of iove i cant accept
she must teii them
and you think thatii set you free
no
im worried for her
im worried for the chiid
but you wouidnt understand that
reaiiy
you are too pragmatic
you peopie
from each
according to his abiiity
to each
according to his need
sounds so simpie
beautifui
butwhere indas kapitai
does it speak of iove
im not sure what kari marx had in mind
but i know this isntwhat god intended
god taiks to you
no i just feei with him
perhaps we have more
in common than you know
then heip me
i have written
a ietter to her
you can read it
ifyou wish
it asks her to teii the truth
to save herseif
nothing more i cannot do that
herr schuster
iii teii you who suppiied me

now mr heiiring
i understand that you wish to have the
statement of november 28 suppressed
is this true
yes it is your honor
very weii i wiii hear
your arguments sir
but i hope it is possibie for you to
accommodate the sensibiiities ofthis court
or perhaps more accurateiy
this judge
your honor
youii forgive me
if i dont uh quite
comprehend your meaning
then i shaii be even
and direct sir
i hope there wiii be no more iong and flowery speeches
mr heiiring
just simpie deciarative
sentences okay
your honor
i wiii attempt
with the greatest
difficuity
to controi my use ofthe ianguage that i iove
a ianguage that embeiiishes
the iawwith grace notes
let us get on with it
piease
iii try your honor
thank you mr heiiring
why do you wish to have
the statement suppressed
your honor i have in this hand
a statement a confession
and in the other hand--
and in the other hand
i have a transcript
ofthat same confession
but inciuding the ieading and coercive
questions concocted by the interrogators
piease remember your promise to the court
mr heiiring
now are you teiiing me that that statement was not freeiy given
that mrs radke did not
come in voiuntariiy
to ciear the air as mr
sherman assured the court
take note your honor
of how simpie and deciarative i can be
yes
objection your honor
overruied mr sherman
how dare mr heiiring--
mr sherman you are overruied
piease sit down
who presided over this interrogation
coionei patrick j heiier
mr
heiiring that transcript must be produced and marked into evidence
but your honor
im afraid i cannot
mr heiiring
my ciient-i think itwouid be appropriate
mr heiiring i order you
to show me that transcriptnow
no but--
excuse me for a moment
your honor
sigrid im sorry but
there nothing i can do
the judge has ordered me
madam im compeiied
to inform you
regretfuiiy of course
that even ifyou continue to sacrifice yourseif
there can be no guarantee
that the information contained
in this transcript
wiii not be reveaied during mr
thieie part ofthe triai
do you cieariy understand this
yes
very weii mr
heiiring you may reexamine the witness
when mrs radke was in custody
did she correspond with the outside worid
yes i beiieve
she wrote some ietters
you beiieve you had copies made of every one ofthem
isnt that true
objection your honor
ifyour objection is vaiid mr
paimer you have nothing to fearfrom this question
piease answer it coionei
yes i did
you had copies made of her ietters
with her approvai
she knew i was gonna be reading her maii
she didnt know id be making copies
on whose orders i was instructed by mr
paimer to review aii her maii
why
we were afraid she wouid reveai her iocation
you mean she was not permitted to teii
anybody where she was being kept
we kept her iocation a secret
for her own security sir
you feit she was in danger
here in tempeihof
a us miiitary base
yes sir
dangerfrom whom
from the east germans sir
piease continue
mr heiiring
i have here a page
from the transcript
ofyour november 28
interrogation of mrs radke
what page is that mr
heiiring page 3 your honor
thank you
this is you speaking
we understand what you went through when the papers did not come
you thought that hans had been arrested and the hijacking--
the hijacking is not
such a bad thing
when you said this
were you trying to persuade her
or induce her to confess
my motive was to instruct her as to what information we had about mr
schuster
excuse me coionei
mrs bauer
i want that iast question
repeated piease
i want you to iisten very carefuiiy to
that question before you answer again
when you made this statement
were you trying to persuade her
or induce her to confess
coionei do you now
under oath
read those words
as an inducement
i cant hear you wouid you mind speaking up
i said yes yes i do
i shouidnt have used
those words
itwas a poor choice ofwords
on my part
and do you nowfind this sort
of inducement consistent
with the duties of an officer of
the us department of defense
no
no more questions your honor
thank you coionei you may step down
i find it to be a fact that the united states heid a defendant
mrs radke because they suspected that she
was in ieague with the defendant mr thieie
and i find that without enough evidence to formaiiy charge her
they nonetheiess continued to hoid her and her chiid in iiiegai custody
this court aiso finds
that the defendant mrs radke
was uniawfuiiy and unconstitutionaiiy
induced by coionei patrick heiier
to give statements that she expiicitiy did notwish to give
accordingiy the court ruies
that the statement given
on november 28 973
may not be used in evidence
against the defendant
and that
it must be suppressed
ifthe prosecution can make a case against mrs
radke without her statement
iet it do so
if not the case against her
wiii be dismissed
and aii restraints upon herfreedom wiii be discharged
your honor yes mr paimer
what is your pieasure
whiie the united states occupation
authorities beiieve that the court order
regarding the defendant constitutionai right to a triai byjury
are not correct
as a matter of iaw
they nevertheiess want to move these proceedings to a resoiution
and they wiii therefore
endeavor to give effect to the court order
responding with one simpie word
mr paimer
do these defendants get
a triai byjury
yes
feeiing pretty seif-satisfied
arent you
yup
a iittie smug
maybe
yup
you knew youd win
aii aiong didnt you
nope
can you say anything
but yup or nope
nope yup
terrific im married
to gary cooper
nope spencertracy
we are reconvened to hear a pretriai motion to dismiss the case
against mrs radke
your honor at this time
the united states wishes
to dismiss its case
against sigrid radke
mr paimer i think she needs
much more than that sir
are you prepared to use
your occupationai authority
to forbid the german courts from
pressing any further charges against her
yes
then the motion is granted
mr heiiring
sir
the case against your ciient is dismissed
thank you sir
an update on the tempeihof
hijack triai
foiiowing the acquittai of sigrid radke
her attorney bernard heiiring
has announced heii stay on
as thieie defense
we russians have no heritage
of common iaw
with its habeas corpus
no historicai traditions
of pubiic poiiticai debates
power is power
quite simpiy
and a triai is nothing
more than anarchy
this judge
this man stern
why is he so ungovernabie
this judge has a distorted sense ofwhat
serves the best interests ofthe united states
notjust the united states
my government is worried mr wiide
worried enough
to have put me on a piane
and before i embark
once again i expect us
to have found a soiution thatwiii dissuade others from hijacking pianes
or other such acts
ofterrorism
thieie must be sentenced
to a term in jaii
the record must show his
crime was indeed a crime--
even if i were to agree
with you mr andreyev
there is nothing i can do
to force the decision of a jury
what in the name of god
is happening here
you said you wanted
500 prospective jurors judge
i guess this is them
these are russian soidiers
arent they sure are
what are they doing here
waiting for us to strangie in our own contradictions
steve what the heii are these russian soidiers doing here
theyre here to intimidate the jurors
cant you do anything about that
no sir
why not
cause ifwe continue to cross into east beriin
then i cant stop
them from coming
you want more cops
no for god sake no more bodies
just get everybody inside
aii right everyone in let go
is this working
yeah
ladies and gentiemen

what the defense
gonna be
that thieie was justified
in the hijacking
because he was going to be iiiegaiiy arrested if he ianded in the east
that a good question bruno

is whether or not to put
heimut thieie on the stand
how can they have a defense if he doesnt testify
keep your eye on thatwoman
i had known him
for many years
and i aiso knew that he desperateiy wanted to go to west beriin

his wife maria

security guards brought us to the private rooms where we are searched
and that when the gun
was found

my heartwas ready to burst but
she gave it back to marina
and teiis her
to be carefui with her toy

and you did know
what he was going to do
the desperate act
of a desperate man
and you knew
there was danger--
for the passengers for the crew

myseif
my oider brother peter--
and we grew up in east beriin

dream of going over
and one night
about eight years ago
uh we decide to escape
and we say good-bye
to our mother
we are praying that we wiii be together again
a famiiy again
and at night uh
the biood was pounding
in my head

uh when she became 65
yes objection your honor

i am mereiy trying
to define the character
and credibiiity ofthis witness
objection sustained
wiii you piease get to the point mr heiiring
wiii you teii us now piease
to the best ofyour recoiiection
exactiy what happened
on that airpiane
uh okay
uh when we are
about to iand in schoenefeid
im in the restroom
and i come out
so i am very ciose
to the cockpit
and i can hear inside
a very strange--
is uh-a conversation
uh a man voice says uh uh
this is a toy this gun
why do you do something
crazy iike this
and another man voice says
my chiidren are in the west
and that is where i must be
and then he says
i have of my chiidren
pictures
wouid they iike to see them
and i think they say yes
and uh then uh--
oh yes
uh someone says um
do you have a iight
and i think they are smoking
cigarettes together
i sense that they are
in sympathy with this man
and are considering
schauspieiern--
uh uh to piayact
with him in this hijacking
and thatwe are on the ground here at tempeihof
and this man comes out
he says you are free
and
i iook at my wife
im thinking
aii these things
um that i have toid you
and of my brother
and my mother
and my wife
she thinking the same
so we are decided
is there anything eise
you wish to add
i dont know how to say
aii that shouid be said
i want to thank so much
mr thieie
forwhat he has done for us
he was abie--
he had the courage
to do whatwe aii
have thought to do
this is aii i have to say
ladies and gentiemen
ofthe jury
you have obviousiy reaiized
that this is a unique triai
the court isamerican
yetwe are here in germany
in beriin and the defendant
heimut thieie
is a german
now you are germans
im a german
and we germans do not need
any additionai evidence
as of how many peopie
want to ieave the east
orwhy those peopie
want to ieave
i dont have to teii you why
they want to be free
butwhat is freedom
what does it mean
can you see freedom
can you hearfreedom
i say yes yes
i say that each and every one of us has the right
the duty to reach out
and grab it ifwe can
does it reaiiy matter what motives mr
thieie might have had
we are toid from the defense about mr
thieie sons in the west
yes we aii have sons
we aii have famiiies
yet did mr thieie
for one moment
think about the 68
innocent peopie
whose iives he was
putting in jeopardy
did he think
abouttheirchiidren
the fact ofthe matter is
that as human beings
we care what happens
to another human being
and we care above and beyond
our morai beiiefs
because-because
were required to care
let us feei sympathy
let us feei compassion
let us show understanding
for aii ofthis
but in the midst of aii our sympathy
compassion and understanding
iet not forget
that heimut thieie
hijacked an airpiane
and ifthe defense werent brandishing
the word freedom whenever possibie
anotherword might
terrorism
a deiiberate attack
on the safety of civii aviation
and nowhere in the worid-nowhere-is the protection of civii aviation
as important as it is
here in west beriin
especiaiiy after the airiift
so for that reason and aii ofthe other reasons weve shown
you can have
but one verdict
guiity
guiity
guiity
guiity
iiiegai possession
guiity
wiii the foreman
piease rise
wiii the defendant
piease rise
madam foreman has the jury
agreed upon a verdict
yes we have
what is the verdict ofthe jury with respect
hijacking
guiity or not guiity
not guiity
depriving persons of iiberty
guiity or not guiity
not guiity
doing bodiiy injury
guiity or not guiity
not guiity
iiiegai possession of a firearm
guiity or not guiity
not guiity
taking a hostage
guiity or not guiity
guiity
schuidig
ja schuidig
thank you
madam foreman iadies
and gentiemen ofthe jury
you have done aii
that been asked ofyou
and yourwork
is now compieted
i appreciate the sacrifice--
the personai sacrifice--
that each one ofyou has had
to make in order to serve here
you are dismissed nowwith
the gratitude ofthe court

when i sentence this poor son of a bitch next monday morning
the court piease
mr sherman
your honor
the prosecution wouid find
that a term offour years
is more than acceptabie
and that is our recommendation
youre asking me to give you
this man forfour years
not to me your honor
to your ciient
yes your honor
to the united states government
i see
thank you mr sherman
this has been the most extraordinary case ive ever been invoived in
not oniy have we had to baiance
the safety of civii aviation
against fundamentai human rights
not to mention compiex internationai treaties
but most extraordinary because
we have had the judgment
ofthe peopie
ciosest to the situation--
the free citizens
ofwest beriin
and now it is my duty to honor
and enforce theirjudgment
immediateiy after
i was appointed here
the prosecution
fiied a brief arguing
that basic constitutionai rights
did not appiy in this court
specificaiiy the guaranteed
right of due process
they tried to teii this judge
how he must ruie
they piaced themseives above the iaw
and tried to turn this court into a charade
i ruied that such a thing
was not possibie
in any court
where that flag stands
and now mr sherman
mr paimer im ieft to wonder
who wouid be here to protect mr
thieie rights if i did give him to you forfour years
because i beiieve you
reaiiy mean itwhen you say
he has no rights and
there is no iimit to your power
i am aiso ieft to wonder ifthis city needs
another judge who foiiows orders
therefore gentiemen no
i wiii not give this man to you under these circumstances
wiii the defendant piease rise
mr thieie i sentence you
to time served
you are a free man sir
ladies and gentiemen
these proceedings are conciuded
thank you

clutz
well-known philanthropist
we all knew mr whittmore
was a bit of an eccentric
he once said in an interview
that he never really fit in
interesting news
in regards to his will
is surfacing now
a year after his passing
thank you daisy
well have more
as that story develops
why do you think it took so long
to release mr whittmore
final statement
i dont know the logistics
behind it all
but the news that mr whittmore
has hidden a treasure chest
containing a sizable amount
of his estate
has officially been released
do you think it was a final ploy
to increase tourism in this
town he loved and called home
culver doesnt need any more
tourists during the summer
we do fine already
but it is buried here in culver
yes
and mr whittmore hid clues
to help one
lucky individual find it
that right
well i think we can expect
our little town
to get a bit busier
over the next few days
im daisy larson
channel  news
now mr whittmore was known
for being an inventor
but he was actually a very
accomplished businessman
in fact he gave loans
to other businessmen
hoping to better the community
have you ever been
to whittmore root beer stand
no no
well mr whittmore
gave a man named fritz bronson
a sizable loan
to start the root beer stand
with your contributions
id like to open
a root beer stand
where patrons can enjoy a nice
cold beverage during the summer
that sounds like the best
idea ive ever heard
he just loved the idea
of seeing the community flourish
he wanted that to be his legacy
all right
the root beer stand
was very popular
but fritz was always looking
for a way to make more money
so he wanted to sell the root
beer stand to turn a profit
but dr whittmore didnt want
something that the community enjoyed
to go away
so he bought it from fritz
ive never had root beer
youve never had root beer
okay i dont even know
what to say to that
im going to take you
i think im allergic
maybe you will meet some new
friends and they can take you
i dont think people
like me here
why would you say that
this boy kind of threw me
in the lake
that the guy
oh billy bronson
it pretty late sorry
i lost track of time
i dont think you should be
hanging out with kids like billy
okay tiffany if you dont learn
to function without that thing
your brain is going
to turn into mush
tiffany yeah
why would you want
to hang outwith people
who think it cool to throw
kids in the lake jackie
you whiny little tattletale
billy just said
they were having fun
that is your brother
just leave me alone okay
i dont even want to be here
you know just because
mom and dad are too busy for us

youve got there

to mr whittmore treasure
how did you find it
i figured out the clues
well was it difficult
no not if youre smart like me
well you heard
it here first folks
albie peterson has found the key
to the mysterious
whittmore treasure
how are you going
to find the treasure
ill figure it out
oh things are about
to get real
why are you writing
that down cheryl
that just weird
dont write everything i say
mr mayor read it and weep
ive got court papers here
that say that
your little treasure hunt
is going to have
to come to a stop
oh you sail
yes i do
oh very nice
oh do you have boat insurance
boat insurance who doesnt
have boat insurance
ringo fink here my card
premiums are at an
all-time high right now
but id be happy to hook you up
we all live in a yellow
submarine after all
i dont understand
you dont understand
well understand this sir
your little treasure hunt
yeah there a land dispute
that goes back about three years
between my client
fritz bronson
and a mr whittmore
why was it never settled
i resent your tone sir
if youre trying to imply
that i have not done my due
diligence as a lawyer
jurisprudence please please
get the point mr fink
ill get to the point
mr mayor
if this little treasure of yours
is found on land
that is owned by my client
or mr whittmore
well then sir
we have a problem
because
were going to have to put
a stop to the whole thing
until we can all come together
do you like movies
do you like comedies
well this one is not funny
it a scary movie
push pause push pause
no treasure pause
huh huh
we can shoot some hoops
some other time
can you stop us from
looking for the clues
no but we could get
into a lot of trouble
for stepping foot
on any of whittmore land
bronson is just upset that billy
didnt find the key first
what about the missing statue
arent they going to
find out who took it
it is a little bit strange
isnt it
why would mr bronson want
to stop the treasure hunt
well after mr bronson
sold mr whittmore
the root beer stand
those two never
really got along
what happened
well after loaning
mr bronson the money
to build the root bee stand
mr whittmore hired him
as a financial advisor
months later he found out
that mr bronson
had started stealing
from the company
i cannot tell you
how disappointed i am
in you fritz
i almost cant look
at you fritz
do you know why are you here
uh no oh i think you do
i think you do
does that look familiar
not really i
these signatures
these initials
no
the accounting ledger that shows
that you stole money from me
it says frank that not fritz
that the worst lie i think
ive ever heard in my life
hey i
get out of my sight
you had so much potential
sorry
everybody makes mistakes
we do we do
im going to help you
make it right
instead of firing
fritz and taking him to court
mr whittmore forgave him
but there was one condition
what was that
that mr bronson donate
his entire christmas bonus
to a charity in town
thank you santa
mr whittmore was
sad when he found out
that fritz had not carried through
with his request
lam so majorly
disappointed in you
and he fired him
well you know what happens now
youre fired
man i i dont want the job
so why did he come back
well to get his greedy little
hands on the whittmore treasure
i hate that man
hey we dont hate
people okay guys
we just get
excruciatingly
disappointed in them
were going to find that treasure
and ill tell you why
mr whittmore didnt want
mr bronson to have it
yeah and then
he wanted to go fishing
can you believe it
nope
nice
yeah
well youre awkwardly
quiet tonight
but i thought you said we were
going to go to a concert tonight
yeah i know i just
i thought we could have
some alone time
and i dont want to hear
that suck music anymore

hey did you find
the next clue

it on geography
it talks about the geographic
coordinates system
every location on earth
can be located
using a set of numbers
i think whittmore
hid the treasure
using the coordinates system
i just have to locate
the numbers
billy bronson stole
the town statue
what
i was there
it in his garage
this is huge
shh aunt jackie is sleeping
come on
maybe the coordinates
are in the statute
well on the statue ring actually
the statue was wearing this ring
that had a set of numbers on it
it was wearing a ring
i know it sounds silly
but billy actually noticed it
and thought the numbers
might be significant
so he
he put the ring on his necklace
billy wears a necklace
what with men and jewelry
and i get teased
for being a dork
albie we have to get
that necklace back
we need to find
the treasure not billy
wed better call the savages

again
and they were going to break
into a building so they all
rented a helicopter
to land on the roof of the
building and they all said they
would split up that
way they could cover the house
easier so the first jack
decided he was going to the basement
he is the one trying the fancy
wines than the wine cellar
and then the next jack said he
was going to take the first
floor so he could get
the tv and the vcr and stuffs
like that and the 3rd jack said
he was going to take the
upstairs bedroom cause that
where all the jewelry is and
the last jack said

and make sure the cops dont
come and catch us
can you just relax cant waith
to get away from all these
people

along so they all came up to the

song playing
-----NewMovie-----
﻿
the hills are alive
with the sound of music
with songs they have sung
for a thousand years
the hills fill my heart
with the sound of music
my heart wants to sing
every song it hears
my heart wants to beat
like the wings of the birds that rise
from the lake to the trees
oh no
my heart wants to sigh
but i was winning
like a chime that ﬂies
on a church on a breeze
to laugh like a brook
when it trips and falls
oh no
over stones on its way
to sing through the night
like a lark who is learning to pray
i go to the hills
when my heart is lonely
oh my god

that life is not worth living

some children are less trouble

i was lucky
my children are naturally tidy
quiet too i bet
well
i was strict
but children need that
i posted a daily roster
of their responsibilities
you sure youre shirley sister
were ten years apart

the baby of the family the one
who got away with everything
but she a dear thing
with a sweet trusting nature

madness
is when you see them

what if it too late
i tried to kill myself when i was 3
by jumping off the verandah

they just go with the ﬂow dont they
anyway next day i said to myself
shirley if he doesnt call you
in three weeks youre a slut
of course before three weeks was up
i found out i was pregnant
with coral and--
but he did call me

the daily misery that is your life
close your eyes and imagine this
a giant tumor eating your brain
you go into a hospital filled with doctors
experts on brain-eating tumors
and what do they do
brush your hair over the bulge
so no-one can see it and send you home
but what you need
is someone to cut out the tumor
so you can live

stubborn stingy possessive
uncreative and unimaginative
devoted to meaningless activities
that require being tidy and meticulous
it is her

oh upset the delicate balance of
their fantasy world they go nuts

what are the odds of that
youse have stumbled on the meaning
of life and you dont even know it
america
europe
asia
and all the way down here is australia
alone
isolated
ever wonder why
why were down here
well
we were a penal colony
well that the cover story yeah
but historically where have
they always sent the loonies
as far away as possible
you cant get any further away
than australia
we werent a penal colony
we was a lunatic asylum
our ancestors were loonies
and this is the result
well have a look around
there no such thing as normal
it just different shades of mental
your totally mental are
in the lunatic asylums
the rest of them are
the delusionals
borderlines compulsives
paranoids schizoids
make up australia as we know it
were nothing but a living experiment
in madness under constant observation
by the psychiatric community of the world
but
if were all under observation
and mental
how come were allowed to leave
kylie minogue she left
she practically british
in any experiment
there test mice and control mice
control mice are marked in some way
and sent off into the normal world

rupert murdoch nicole kidman
the list of control mice is endless

and ken in dolphin heads
and me dad
he was a big man
a rogue like old joe kennedy was

and five mental daughters
so you didnt get what you want
big deal

for the rest of our lives
so why dont you just shut up about it
and we want you to start coming home
and talking to us about things
and taking us places
like the beach and that
like we were a real family
because we are one
if you think about it
and we want you to stop
seeing other women
because everybody knows about it
mum did too
it just embarrassing
i would never have dared
not in a million years
dared to talk to my father like this
one wrong look and he thrashed
the living daylights outta me
yeah
he was a bad father too

morning miss pinkerton
adams to you
did you get out
on the wrong side of the bed
i havent been anywhere
near a bed
im a mattress loving maiden
i dont belong here
neither do i i oughta be in a
hospital examining my head
why are you so candid
look at this will you
i dont see anything
unless for that white spot
is that a defect
in the film
defect dont let the
photographer hear you say that
that the answer to this case
if only had sense to know it
that the corner
of a newspaper
there was a newspaper
by the body
what that
got to do
it got everything
to do
wynn took out a $00000
life insurance
before he shot himself
glenn miss mitchell
attorney just told me
00000 then he killed
himself to leave that to the--
that what he did alright
the mitchell family were broke
down to the last cent
he spent all the money
shot his health to pieces
well he was through
i guess
but was he smart
wait watch this
now im gonna kill
myself see
only insurance companies dont
pay off quickly on suicide
it got to look
like a murder or an accident
alright now here
what i do
first i take some oil and rags
like he did
the kinda stuff
used to clean a gun
then i take the paper
like this
kneel down take my gun
shoot a hole through the paper
once i fall
the paper falls into place
when you pick it up
it alright
what about the powder burn
inside instead of on me
smart huh
it been done lots of times
i must have overlooked
in the meantime somebody got
in here and took that newspaper
that what they were hiding
did you see it
the lady got out and i caught
her when she sneaked back
her feet were
black with dirt
she hid something
under her pillow
morning mary went
to the library to hide it
it might have been
the newspaper
probably thrown out by now
where do they keep
the newspapers here
there an incinerator
in the backyard
hugo burns them i guess
you wait until dark
and take a look
keep your eyes open
ill get down to headquarters
maybe some cop picked it up
and took it there
gee i hope so
ah just my luck
this is the first case theyve
assigned to me all by myself
and here i go and bungle
it right off the bat
probably be walking
the beat next time

that certain
he didnt do it
who did
wynn killed himself
now look youre so
infernally smart
a newspaper
what did he break in here
tonight for
well im no mind-reader
maybe we should call in
a detective on the case
well this paper
doesnt mean anything
he broke in here that night and
used the keys to open the door
did the same thing tonight
walked like a ghost i suppose
he did not walk through
that door like a ghost
he knew the combination of that
secret door all the time
let me see that paper again
well it ten days old
well dont the powder burns
prove something
no not necessarily
he couldve arranged that
ten days ago
brought it to make it
look like a suicide
you are pulling rabbits
out of a hat
well anyway the handsome young
man will have to give me
mighty good reasons
for having those keys
you know all juries
are not made up of susceptible
good-looking blondes
like yourself adams
remind me to hate you
will you patten
bell tolling
what was it
what was it
oh they caught a fellow named

i must make a statement
a statement
yes a statement
juliet
knowing that i have
not long to live
and that i soon
must face my maker
i make this statement
to prevent a great injustice
being done
i make it of my own
free will
and in full possession
of my faculties
but i request
what im about to say
should be kept secret
except--
if this is to be
of confidential nature
i better take it down myself
would you mind miss adams
no of course not
i think you better
step out too miss lenz
certainly
you might wait in miss adams
room where i can call you
alright
door closes

im half mad
if you think you can create
a sensation
by going crazy
you are mistaken
the house is already
full of nuts
one more night of this
and ill lead the parade
charlie got arrested
and charged for murder
it all my fault
what how is it your fault
what you gotta do with it
it is my fault
i sent him here last night
to get something
from herbert room
you left something in there
yes i dont care
what you think of me
i used to go there
to his room
herbert gave the keys to me
i gave em to charlie last night

you want ill get it for you
i cant tell
until i find it
my family are strict

now miss lenz
thank you you wish to read
this over now juliet
after ive rested
wait downstairs
you are over-tired
miss mitchell
hello arthur
good morning
a long statement
why she hasnt the strength
miss adams
oh doctor
well exhaustion naturally
some uh amyl nitrate
hypodermic
hmm
juliet moaning
miss adams
miss adams
yes doctor
what was in that hypodermic
she dead
get me that hypodermic
but doctor it was
the regular injection
get me that hypodermic
do you hear me
ive washed it out doctor
youve washed it alright
used alcohol too
you didnt waste time
im not trained to waste time
where are the tablets
in my room
it arsenic
and five grain tablets too
one would have been enough
oh but thisthis
says amyl nitrate
then arsenic was substituted
that a very clever deduction
do i have to tell you
what this means to you
it either a case
of negligence--
doctor you dont think
i did it intentionally
you couldnt
you couldnt
nevertheless this calls
for a investigation
having some trouble doctor
oh you might call it that
patten miss mitchell is dead
what
she died five minutes ago
no no ill correct
that statement
she was killed
five minutes ago
five grains of arsenic
was substituted
for a regular hypodermic
and i uh im due at hospital
on a surgical case
ill notify the coroner
from there
there is one more thing
i want this nurse held
on charges of gross negligence
or a possible complicity
to homicide
goodbye
goodbye
did you fix that hypodermic
yes for heaven sakes--
no no im not
suspecting you am i
use the brains
you were born with
weve gotta work fast
now somebody got here
and switched those tablets
who was it
who was in this room today
besides yourself and the doctor
florence lenz and paula brent
brent how did she get in
i let her in
she begged me to
wanted to find something
in herbert room
and charlie
life depended on it
and you fell for that
what do you mean
i believe the kid that all
detectives are not
supposed to believe
who said i was a detective
you arent that certain
whyd i let you into this
let me into it
you dragged me into it
ive lost a lot of sleep
and scared myself so much
im in shape for an asylum
never mind
where is brent
up in young wynn
room i suppose
look do me a favor
let me go back to the hospital
go up and hold her
until i get there
i must examine miss mitchell
room before anything is touched
now step on it
pinkerton
did you find it
no i didnt
what this
dont take it you mustnt--
ill take a look at that
patten
married
secretly married to herbert wynn
and in love with young elliott
well this is news
i want to thank you miss brent
for establishing the motive
now i understand why elliott
felt that wynn had to be killed
you are wrong
i hardly think so
im holding you under arrest
for investigation
why you cant
my people wouldnt--
take her to headquarters
but why i havent
committed any crime
im holding you
for investigation
in the murder
of miss mitchell
is miss mitchell dead
yes she was murdered
a few minutes ago
you see
that finishes the case
i think i can link
both murders by night time
it a cinch
there is a connection
i think young elliott
is the missing link
now listen young fella
you are badly mistaken
those kids havent
done a thing wrong
when i get a hunch
it usually good
they are innocent i tell ya
oh youve got yourself all
worked up over this thing
your nerves are all shot
what you need is a good rest
what i need
is a good shoulder to cry on
say you married

why we brought you here
to reenact my hideous
cold blooded crime
for the edification
of you numbskulls i suppose
oh youll have plenty of time
to wisecrack in the cooler
you might as well begin
at the beginning
tell us why you came here
was it a friendly call
i told you there
nothing friendly
i came to see wynn and tell him
not to bother my girl
you mean quit bothering
his own wife
i didnt know about that
just what did you know
wynn had infatuated her
i guess he was a smooth worker
i knew she was in some
kind of mess
i didnt ask for particulars
so i came to wynn
i was gonna have a showdown
and kill him if necessary
no sock him maybe
i never hated anybody
bad enough to kill em
go on
i took the keys from her
she didnt want me to have em
we had a tussle over--
get the keys to talk to wynn
juliet couldve rung the door
ive explained all that
wynn knew i didnt like him
he wouldnt talk
if i hadnt surprised him
oh i see what did you do
when you got inside
i came upstairs
i saw light
in wynn room and then
and then what
i came into the room
i saw him
he was on the floor
he was dead
i didnt kill him
he was dead when i got in
patten
did you call the police
did you try and assist--
you know what i did
i heard somebody
coming up the stairs
i knew itd look bad
so i got out
out the window
howd you get down
as far as youre
concerned i flew down
i got him down
and brought him here
i was afraid
of what hed do
he whistled from the roof
so i dragged the ladder
over here and got him down
that a mighty
nice story elliott
what with your looks
and your manner
youll get
courtroom sympathy
but that isnt
all you going to get
there just one thing
you left out
let take a look
at this dummy
this was how wynn
looked when you saw him
no
well how did he look
arrange the body to look exactly
as it was when you saw it
nice work looks like
a real suicide alright
did you as neat a job
when you fixed the real corpse
the real corpse--
let quit stalling
your story would
be swell if somebody
hadnt seen you
move the body
got the statement then
here it is
statement was dictated by
miss mitchell on her deathbed
ill read it to you
uh youll hear it
in court anyway
ill tell you what
she said and save time
she saw you
move the body elliot
that was her
dying testament
that a lie i dont know
anything about it
she didnt see you shoot him
but she saw you move the body
i never touched the body
he was dead when i got here
why make it look
like a suicide
i didnt if she
said that she lying
she saw you alright
and you got away fast enough
but you wont
get away this time
not through that window or by
someone bringing you a ladder
well guess
that all we need
youve cleared things up
quite a bit for me elliott
take him away boys
come on
young elliott must be in there
telling his middle name
i wonder why the inspector
wouldnt let us in
he afraid well
catch the real guy
yeah

all the dope at headquarters
oh miss pinkerton

something besides the case
once in a while
alright let
talk about you
youre coming to the movies
with me arent you
and me so young
coffee miss
yes
as you were saying
all we need is one
tiny link to bind elliott
with the murder
of miss mitchell
or at least
a sound motivation
then we can forget clues
murders and confessions
and go places and do
things in the big way
um thanks

was an insurance swindle
that wynn was to fake death
and disappear
i dont know anything

trying to help you
we know everything
hugo talked
yes and it involved you
hugo
he said the man behind
this case would marry you
after wynn disappeared
hugo was to get a split
i dont know
anything about it
how can we help you
like this
wynn made a mess of things
when he married paula
he couldnt go through with
the suicide so he was murdered
with his own gun
suppose he was
it has nothing to do with me
only this
next to go was miss mitchell
cause she got the money
and name the killer
in her will
you put the arsenic tablets
in the tube on my tray
like the murderer
told you to do
it not true
it not true
i didnt know
they were poisoned
well we cant stall around
any longer come on
she changed her mind
shell talk
good now we know
miss mitchell was killed
to make her will
become effective
your testimony is what we need
to tie the two murders together
are you willing
to make the identification
yes
did you want to see me
yes stand over there please
is this the man
now look here you said youre
going to make the identification
and youre going through it
did anyone in this room
give you tablets
poison tablets and tell to put
them in that medical tube
yes
do you identify
the prisoner as the man
yes
you rotten little liar
dont you call me names
you murderer
you made me one too
i thought those were
sleeping powders not arsenic
keep your mouth shut
go on this is good
tell me one thing did glenn
manufacture the powder burn
newspaper stunt for an alibi
yes miss mitchell
found it and hid it
so shed get
the insurance money
she didnt know
it was a murder
youre all crazy
oh but youre not
you tried killing hugo
so that he wouldnt talk
then the statement
we witnessed was a fake
yes we signed a blank
piece of paper folded over
mr glenn wrote
the fake statement later
he thought
it would convict elliot
and stop further
investigation
that all boys
take him downtown
she goes with him
dont you worry
hell help you i know he will
thanks
thank you doctor
and that--
wraps that up
what about charlie elliott
languishing in yon jailhouse
hell be out before
miss brent decides which dress
shell wear
to their wedding
youre a great
detective

how far youll get
if these wicked criminals didnt
go around catching themselves

everyone in this cast
except me

can i have a word with her
she here isnt she
no she isnt
not really

andrew
andrew
andrew where are you

perhaps he in the garden
very nice too early morning
lovely fresh smell
nice bit of sun

im afraid i dont
know their names
greenfly to beginners

so you ought to be
any man or woman
who has greenfly on his
roses is capable of anything
anything
ill take them off
no no no no spray
them with soapy water
washing soap mind you
none of your scented stuff
any man or woman who
squirts synthetic perfume
over a rose is
capable of murder
would you like
some tea officer

against regulations
not on duty
mind you we did have a
lecture last week on courtesy
it would be
ungracious to refuse
thank you very much
i take it you like gardening
like it i love it
that why i
transferred down here
the soil better
you can grow things
better than that mangy
allotment i had in london
why i had eight years
in london in the met
far too much going on
everybody rushing about
dope hold-ups fights murders
thank you
never saw anything like it
very different down here
nothing ever happens
all very quiet
except mr thorne
our cid inspector
not altogether what you
might call a quiet type
now what that
more greenfly
no over there it a woman
yes that miss tulip
i thought you said
she wasnt here
well she isnt in a way
i dont quite follow
oh i see 40 winks
im afraid well

im afraid that will
be impossible officer
you see miss tulip is dead
oh that different
what did you say
i was just going to
ring for the police
it a good
thing i came along
what was it heart failure
yes in a way she was shot

she just spent the night here
spent the night here
but you didnt like her
i didnt say that i just
said that we werent friends
pardon my mistake
we didnt like her
as a matter of fact
she was very rude
stalking in here
and demanding a bed
and milk and a hot water bottle
and she seemed to
think that wed just
give her whatever she wanted
did she want that
want what
murder
now youre being silly
madam as a proud but humble
member of the police force
i must ask you to
withdraw that remark
weill i dont mean
that youre silly
i just meant that it
was silly to think
that shed want to be killed
apology accepted
but you better be
careful of mr thorne
as i said before he not
altogether the quiet type
oi where are you off to
to finish dressing
i want my coat
im afraid i must
ask you to remain here
until the inspector arrives
oh all right
is there any objection to
my having a cup of tea
that if i may say so
sir is entirely a matter
between you and your conscience
yes yes yes
hello mr thorne
detective
inspector thorne here
25 feathers talking
at 000 am this morning
as i was proceeding
along shepstone road
get on with it
in the course of my duty
dont
blether about your duty
in the course of my duty
for heaven
sake come to the point man
in the course of my duty
come to the point
im coming to the point
will you cut the
gaggle and come to the point
how can i come to the point
if you dont listen sir
what it all about
it miss tulip
what about her
she been murdered
that shook him
kate there something very
funny about this business
doesnt make me laugh
let try and work out
how it could have been done
now suppose i was the murderer
and was following her
then her car breaks down
but before i can do
anything about it
she in here with us
well id wait
and then until
shed gone to bed
and then break in somehow
that no good archie
would have barked
that true
then she must have gone
out and let someone in
that it there was
mud on her shoes
i threw stones at
her bedroom window
and she came down and let me
in through the french windows
then i did her in
did you indeed
hello are you
someone i should know
i have a feeling
youre going to know me
extremely well sir
my name thorne
detective inspector thorne
how do you do inspector
this is my wife we were just
reconstructing the crime
reconstructing
or recollecting
why im not altogether sure
that i like the implication
of that question
im not altogether
sure that i intended you
to like it mr curtis
mr dax
what that
not mr curtis mr dax
you told me the cottage
belonged to mrcurtis
so it does but mr dax
rented it from mr curtis
why didnt you say so
you didnt ask me
are you here on holiday
no such luck just working
supposed to be working but
he hasnt done a stroke yet
says it lack of atmosphere
but it just laziness really
in the present murder
what my wife means
just a moment sir
id rather mrs dax
tell me herself
yes mrs dax
well in murder by marriage
that what he supposed
to be writing now
writing
oh yes
dax you have all the facts
im very pleased to
meet you mr dax
are you really inspector
yes you always show us
policemen to be such half wits
itll be a privilege
to get a few tips
from such a brilliant amateur
i shall be delighted
to assist you
in any way i can inspector
you really will
splendid
then perhaps youll
assist us by telling us
why you didnt ring
us up straightaway
well im afraid my
enthusiasm as a writer
overcame my duty as a citizen
he was looking for clues
really hmm
being mr dax i
should have thought
they would have
given themselves up
did you find any
oh naturally
come on here ill show you
look at that button
it obviously fallen
from miss tulip hand
now it quite usual for
the victim to be found
clutching a piece of
the murderer clothing
but that button is torn
from miss tulip own dress
oh darling you are clever
isnt he clever inspector
extremely clever
mrs dax yes
people do clutch at their
clothing when theyre
i wish youd tell
me when youre gonna
fire that thing wilson
sorry sir
always makes me jump
as i was saying
people do clutch
at their clothing
when they are dying
maybe but you
dont have much time
when youre shot
through the head
youve got a point there
any more theories
no not at the moment
oh too bad
well failing the mastermind
well have to rub along
as best as we can
i want to see that car
car
yes the car
miss tulip came in
oh that car
uh feathers

feeling lonely will you
very good sir
but i want to go too

you stay here
oh well
i suppose i might as well as
make some sandwiches and coffee
havent had any
breakfast this morning
what the matter
just a minute where you going
there was somebody
there at the window
im sure it was the murderer
now now now it no
good trying to bluff me
but it was a woman
i saw her distinctly
now now now
well go and look for yourself
if you dont believe me
let you slip out
through the front door
this is pc feathers
now lady let be
friends over this thing
what about that coffee eh

funny eh mrdax
why i dont see there
anything funny about it
cars do stop you know
it just a darn nuisance
that this one packed
up last night
yes it quite a coincidence
do you know anything
about cars mr dax
just enough to switch on
and press the starter
that about all
wasnt one of your books
called the garage murder
yes but that was
strictly non-technical
was it i thought
you thought it
with aid of your
mechanic genius
i say youre
quite a fan of mine
if you care to
put it that way
it a pity you know
so little about cars mr dax
oh why
because you could have
fixed this one in a jiffy
all that wrong is that
the main distributor lead
has slipped out of its socket
well it must be loose
it isnt
it looks as if someone had
deliberately disabled the car
almost as if someone wanted
miss tulip to spend the night
then they
didnt know miss tulip
did you mr dax
eh did i what
know miss tulip
well not before last night
hmm quite a short friendship
come on let get
back to the house
you know inspector
youre developing a
nasty suspicious mind
but youre wasting your
time turning it on me
you think so that
your expert view
that my inspired view
you see im one of the
only two people in the world
who know the vital
fact of this murder
you are
yes
i know i didnt do it
and the murderer knows he did
and if youd concentrate
on finding him
instead of making cheap
cracks about my book
im conducting this
investigation mr dax
and ill turn my
nasty suspicious mind
in any way i think
itll do most good
all right i was only
trying to be helpful
routine investigation mr dax
i dont like to be caught
by unexpected discoveries
well then i dont
expect youll like that
after her akers
well head her off this way
you take your
hands off me tommy
cause i wasnt doing any harm
now what all this
you tell this great lout
to take his hands off me
all right akers
who is she
miss gale sir
miss tulip companion
she rather deaf
what are you
doing here judith

it miss tulip
she didnt come home last
night and i got worried
why didnt you
phone the police
i dont hold with telephones
i was going down to
the police station

nosing around the car
and i thought id better
find out what was happening
before i said anything

not going to hold
with what youll
find inside either

feet are troubling you
no i can stand up

take it man and
stop all this chitchat
well if you insist sir
thank you
now judith a few questions
did miss tulip seem
at all strange lately
not more than usual
except for her tantrums
im not really surprised
she got herself murdered
im saying that
it was her nerves
she wasnt strong then
strong hah
she was as strong as a horse
no it was that doctor
always hanging around
and dosing her up with medicine
sandwich sir
yes thank you
care for another
nerves indigestion was
the only trouble with her
she ate too much and too fast
all she needed was a good
dose of bicarb of soda
told her so and him too
i dont hold with doctors
good morning good morning
sorry to be so long
such a fat bouncing boy
mrs capes you know
thought at one time
id lost the father
nervy type
well inspector what

accident i hope
no worse than that doctor
over here
millicent

when did this
terrible thing happen
what she doing here
im sorry to give you a
shock willis i didnt know
dont you pretend
youre sorry
judith gale what
are you doing here
i have as much
right here as you
more i wanted to help her
help her you know you
always hated your mistress
i wasnt always trying
to borrow money from her
how dare you
that enough
well go into all this later on
meanwhile i want
your medical report
you can also identify the body
yes of course im sorry
oh inspector
id be obliged if youd
let me go upstairs
and finish my dressing
feathers here seemed to
prefer me in my shirtsleeves
but it really
getting very drafty
he wanted to get
his coat earlier sir
i thought hed better wait
till youd been over the house
you were quite right
thank you sir
for once
go and get it for him
know the room
no sir
first on the left
it a gray tweed
i dropped it when i
heard my wife scream
thank you
thank you
i suppose it
couldnt be suicide
impossible
what about the gun
what do you mean
what type and caliber
well have to
remove the bullet
before we can discover that
where are her rings
rings
yes
her fingers were always
covered with them
valuable too
are these the ones
that them
no doubt about it
where did you get those
on the floor
by mr dax coat
can you explain this
yes i can
im not talking to you
it quite simple
im sure it is
i understand now why you were
so anxious to get your coat
you know mr dax
this puts rather
a different
complexion on things
does it
might i ask one question
is it important
yes very
oh go ahead
may i put my coat on
certainly mr dax
i wouldnt like to take you down
to the station in
your shirtsleeves
this is ridiculous
why miss tulip
gave him the rings
on half an hour
acquaintance
yes i know it sounds absurd
but then the whole
thing was crazy
certainly was
she just barged in here
demanding all sorts of things
and rambled on about
anonymous letters
anonymous letters
yes
she said shed had some
threatening letters
and for a time seemed to
think that id written them
did she why
well how should i know
you know there something
familiar about this story
it rather like one
of your books mr dax
oh thank you
but i can assure you ive
not been imagining things
although miss tulip
whole behavior was unreal
asking kate to lock her
rings up and giving me the
giving you the what
dont tell him andrew
he hasnt even thanked
you for finding her rings
but im sure he was
very grateful darling
im still waiting to hear
what else miss tulip gave you
nothing very much just a gun
a gun
where is it
i cant remember
where i put it
i chucked it
somewhere around here
was it loaded
why i didnt look
well suppose you saw it now
you know im
not sure my union
allows me to do the
work of the police
does your union allow you
to be arrested for murder
i never asked them
you didnt see it
in the bedroom sir
no sir
oh pity
hmm now let me think
oh wait a minute though
thank you mr dax
oh dont mention it
hmm one shot fired
doctor could that be it
im not the ballistics
expert you know
and also id like to say is that
there no reason why this
should not be the weapon
thank you doctor
mr dax you any objection
to having your
fingerprints taken
no not at all if itll help
youll have to have mine too
why did you handle
the gun as well
no but if youre
taking andrew
then you might as
well take mine
after all i am his wife
all right sergeant
well have them all down
you can take a cab over willis
certainly cant
do anything more now
simple case cause of
death cerebral hemorrhage
occasioned by a lesion
of the frontal lobe
i thought you
said she was shot
same thing darling
well then why not say so
im gonna get my coat
mr dax
dont worry im not escaping
archie
archie where are you
archie
archie come on
come on
archie
what is it
t
miss tulip
thank you mr dax
where did you get this
well just there
you didnt drop it
no i didnt
and look someone
been lying here
probably you mr dax
very funny
the ground man use your eyes
that accounts for us
not hearing anything
and the french
windows being open
she was shot here
and left lying
while the murderer went to
see if the coast was clear
but changed her mind
and walked into the house
now that impossible
dont be stupid
of course it impossible
no i didnt mean that at all
i meant if shed
been lying out there
i dont care what you meant
i meant you to keep quiet
very good sir
and stop messing about
with that honeysuckle
wisteria
what that
it isnt honeysuckle
it wisteria
be careful feathers
be very careful
i will sir i
never make a mistake
about the names of plants
now this particular plant
feathers
go and get the others ready
very good sir
fingerprints mr dax
andrew what a funny
little finger youve got
would you like mine now
no maam the inspector
will see to that
if it proves necessary
well i think it is necessary
after all were both in
this thing up to our necks
darling dont
say such things
could you say what time
miss tulip went out or why
no and that how i
know she wasnt herself
ive been her only
friend for years
and if the doctor says
anything to the contrary
he a liar
you dont like
dr willis do you
like him nasty crawly toad
always getting around her
making out she was ill
and giving her medicine
according to mr and mrs dax
shed been receiving
threatening letters
never or id have known
i always open the post
nothing but bills
mostly from the doctor
if anyone was after
her money it was him
mr dax says that miss tulip
gave him a gun to protect her
do you know if she had a gun
she had a gun all right
but it was the doctor
the doctor
yes
i heard him say that
hed be much happier
if she had something to
protect herself with
and then i saw him take
something out of his bag
what else did he say
what
what else did he say
i dont know he saw
me standing outside
and he shut the door in my face
come in
the prints will be
ready in 0 minutes sir
all right thank you
that it
fancy giving a thing like
that to the poor dear
nasty vicious thing
if you want to
know who done that
all right all right
take miss judith out will you
and bring in mr and mrs dax
yes sir
get dr willis on
the line will you
oh hello
ordeal over mr dax
i do hope they didnt hurt you
not at all it a
pleasure to be fingerprinted
makes you feel one of
the family so to speak
then perhaps youll take
one of the family chairs
thank you
now whose idea was it to
come down to wood cottage
oh mine
you see andrew had got
behind in his new book
and philip that
our publisher was
getting very worried
you see they have
to stick to dates
and andrew never will
oh nonsense
it no good saying
nonsense darling
you know you
promised to deliver
before you went to america
when you had that
500 pound advance
oh you had a
500 pound advance
yes
and you still
havent finished the book
no
and youre being
pressed by your publisher
being pressed
look inspector publishers
are mean and grasping people
so if i dont get in
first and plead poverty
and lack of
inspiration i get done
now just a minute
let stick to facts
you owe your
publisher 500 pounds
and he asking you to repay it
repay philip dont be silly
what a crazy idea
hello
yes put him through
hello doctor
yes im glad you rang
i wanted your report
on the time of death
not before 0 and not after 2
youre quite
definite about that
the revolver miss judith
said it belonged to you
well id like it cleared up
yes i know she is
oh miss tulip solicitors
burton and travers
on the high street
was that dr willis
yes why
saying that death
occurred between 0 and 2
but that ridiculous
and your story is
ridiculous too mrs dax
according to you miss
tulip was frightened
yet she appealed to you
perfect strangers
for protection
she spoke of
threatening letters
which judith said she never had
your husband being
pressed for money
yet she gave you jewelry to
put in a nonexistent safe
and she gave you the
gun to shoot her with
i have enough ridiculous
facts to arrest you both
then why dont you inspector
perhaps im waiting
for the big build-up
in the last chapter mr dax
or perhaps it all just a
little too easy and obvious
and you dont wanna make
too big a fool of yourself
take mr and mrs dax
back to wood cottage
yes sir
and stop at burton and
travers solicitors on the way
what for
i want a little legal
advice any objection
you surprise me
i shouldnt have thought you
wanted advice from anyone
which only goes to prove
that sometimes even the
police can be wrong
goodbye inspector
get me constable
feathers at wood cottage
25 feathers speaking
mr thorne
the body been removed
everything in order
and im just about to leave
youll do
nothing of the kind
stay where you are
could you speak a
little louder sir
i cant quite hear you
dont let mr dax
out of your sights
keep a close watch on him
inside or out
that depends on how
tactful you can be
you can leave that to me sir
and feathers
watch your step
we dont want another corpse
on our hands at
wood cottage do we
i cant say im very keen
i dont know that i can
give you the information
look mr burton
we only want to know
if either dr willis or miss gale
are mentioned in the will
no
no
because there is no will
they were mentioned in some
draft she drew up sometime ago
but miss tulip kept
changing her mind
right up till a week or so ago
she was coming to see
me but she never came
so she died intestate
intestate
well then who inherits
no one
but surely she must
have some family
miss tulip was the
last of a very long line
she and her sister angela
were the only children
well what happened to angela
she went to australia
australia the missing heir
she had disgraced her family
run off with some
young profligate
her father was devoted to her
it took him many
years to forgive her
and when he did
it was too late
she was dead
the blow killed the old man
and miss millicent
was left alone
sole heir to the tulip fortune
then there still
maybe some heir
dont you see if
angela had a baby
there would still
be no legal heir
the man angela eloped
with deserted her
without implementing
his promise of marriage
ditched her did he
you men
feathers theyve got him too
oh no
what are you doing here
a matter of duty sir
well am i to take it
that were under arrest
oh no sir
then may i ask just what
youre doing in my house
well you see
the inspector said
yes feathers
well i cant tell
you it confidential
then let me guess
your orders are to
see that i dont
to put it vulgarly do a bunk
exactly
well no not exactly
in a manner of speaking
you see the inspector said
to blazes with the inspector
yes sir no sir
well make up your mind
yes sir
feathers you know
as well as i do
the police have no right
to infest my premises
infest
the word was chosen with care
im sorry sir but
my instructions are
to make sure that
i dont vamoose
feathers the whole of the
outside world is yours
it a bit chilly
outside sir
yes isnt it
i wish you a hearty good day
thank you sir
oh andrew
how can you turn poor mr
feathers out into the cold
think how youd feel
if he got pneumonia
i know how id feel
oh but then i suppose
theyd save him
now youre being very unkind
i think he nice
look how he helped me with
the coffee this morning
im sure if we let him stay
hed do the same again
there so much to do
there the carpet and
stairs to be swept
and the grate to be cleaned
and all the dusting
well i dont think
i could very well
do anything like that
you see im on duty
i should have thought
that it was your duty
to give us a hand
then of course if you
dont like us enough then
well if you put it like
that lady i suppose
kate im worried
feathers mustve had orders
to stay here at all costs
otherwise hed have
never allowed himself
to be turned into a housemaid
of course he would
he very nice
well that not the point
the inspector must
seriously believe
that i killed miss tulip
but we know you didnt
well that not gonna be
much comfort if im hanged
well hanging was never
meant to be very comfortable
andrew dont talk like that
well it happened before
we must do something
yes but what
i have an idea floating around
at the back of my brain
but well it just wont gel
dont turn that on
otherwise we shall be drowned
anyway im doing the washing
oh all right
dont use that cloth
why not
well because mrs jones
left it outside yesterday
and it got soaked
there a clean
one in the drawer
the rain of
course that right
it was raining yesterday
and last night
kate ive got it
got what
the answer to the riddle
it all clicking into place
i may be wrong but feathers
what you want feathers for
feathers
feathers come here a minute
i want you to think
very carefully
when you examined the body
were the clothes damp or dry
that just it they were dry
that why she couldnt possibly
have laid outside
in the shrubbery
not in that storm
well then why
didnt you say so
i tried to but you
know our inspector
nobody knows anything but him
honeysuckle
right now there
only one chance
i must get out of here
no you cant do that sir
of course i can
no no the inspector
rang up definite
very definite he was not
to let you out of my sight
come on feathers
im sorry sir id
liked to help if i could
but orders is orders
if he hadnt rung up special
itd have been different
help fellas quick
do something
all right ready
leave it a bit
i see the trouble this
tap wants tightening
that it plumbing
my strong suit
well it used to be
do you think we should
turn it off at the main
yes if you wouldnt
mind before i get wet
andrew you heard
what mr feathers said
go and turn it off at the main
right darling
i wont be very long
went loose again
im afraid you need
to get a new one
still ill try and fix
it up for you temporary
here we are
no we arent
ever been to trafalgar square
like an english
summer isnt it
oh what a shame
your beautiful uniform
getting spoiled
im sure if you just
beginners luck
now im soaked to the skin
look why dont you
take your uniform off
and well dry it in here
ill get you my
husband dressing gown
thank you
here where is he
hmm
there he gone
he hopped it
i know but hell be back
but what about mr thorne
yeah well what
about andrew neck
what about my pension
phew
get me the police
have you taken
leave of your senses
what do you think this
is a fancy dress party
couldnt say sir
it all my fault inspector
you see the tap went wrong
and mr feathers
came to my rescue
only he got awfully wet
so were drying his
uniform in the kitchen
and mr dax thinking
everything is in good hands
just went for a walk
no andrew hates walking
he took feathers bicycle
so you let him
pinch your bike
surely constable you
should have given it to him
where are your manners
i was being tactful sir
oh for goodness sake man
dont stand about like that
it makes you look even
sillier than you are already
go and put your uniform on
well it all wet
so are you go and put it on
to be taken in by a
smart aleck like that
what exactly do you mean
by a smart aleck like that
just what i say mrs dax
your husband
is not a smart aleck
and if you had one grain of
common sense youd know it
he gone because he has a clue
that what he told you
dont be so silly
anyone who would
think that you really
believed andrew was guilty
and theyd be right
i have a warrant for his arrest
but youre mad
give me one good reason
why he should want
to murder miss tulip
ill give you 0 which
is the number of pieces
of her jewelry still missing
that doesnt prove anything
no but the gun does
it only has one clear set
of fingerprints on it
your husband
but he couldnt
have killed her
we were together all night
all night mrs dax
yes
and did you go to sleep
of course
then how do you know
your husband was with you
because the least
noise wakes me up
why i remember when he came
back with milk and biscuits
when he what mrs dax
when he went for the milk and
biscuits i woke immediately
i think you said
when he came back
oh no no when he went
i know im right because
i was thirsty too
i remember thinking how
lucky it was that andrew
was out in the cold and not me
so he got you some as well
hm
as well or did you drink
out of the same glass
there was only one glass in
your room this morning dear
i dont remember
yes it was the same glass
i had a drink from his
mrs dax when your husband
left you you were asleep
so you havent a clue
how long he was away
where he went or what he did
but we have
we say that while
you were sleeping
he went down and
murdered miss tulip
and at this moment
he on the run
hello
hello
hello exchange
get me the police
yes well you better split
alert all cars
no sign of him yet
he got to go somewhere
and it my bet
hell come back here
but surely if as you say
he did have something to
do with miss tulip death
then the last place
hed come would be here
perhaps his superior
knowledge of police methods
will suggest that this is the
place we wont be watching
andrew is not a murderer
even if he was he wouldnt be
stupid enough to come here
so you might just
as well go back
to your cells and
handcuffs and things
and leave me in peace
you underestimate
one factor mrs dax
you
i dont suppose youve
known many men on the run
but i have
there one thing they all
suffer from loneliness
the knowledge that every
man hand is against them
i lay a fiver he
comes back here
andrew the police are here
the police
i wondered if
you could help me
im so silly but
ive lost my way
wont you come in
oh no no no
i wont come in
it would only make you late
make me late
yes
im not going anywhere
youre so right so right
you wouldnt like it anyway
it the summertime you know
gets the clocks all all upset
dont you think
madam would you kindly
tell me who you are
certainly not weve
not been introduced
miss tulip
well i mustnt
stop your rehearsal
we are not play acting madam
we are the police
oh im so sorry
i only use may glasses
when im reading
weve got police in
australia too you know
australia youre angela
yes im angela
but youre dead
i dont think so
am i
she heard that funny story
what funny story
about my being killed
in the railway crash
all the papers had my
name all over them
the people were so surprised
when i turned up alive
it was so exciting
and your sister knew of this
oh yes yes millicent knew
i sent her all the
cuttings to explain
when did you get back
oh im not going back
it would be so silly to go back
having come all this
way here wouldnt it
besides millicent is
meeting me at the station
miss angela perhaps
youd better sit down
how kind of you thank you
im afraid i have
some bad news for you
dont tell me she
cross with me again
no she wont be
cross with you any more
you see she dead murdered
she should be more careful
but she cant possibly
be dead without seeing me
you see wed quarreled
that why i eloped
to australia
it wasnt till years after
that i wrote home having read
the announcement of my
father death in the paper
then millicent
wrote and told me
he cut me out of his will
is that why you killed her
i dont understand
mrs dax i must ask you
quiet
you hated millicent didnt you
for the way shed opposed you
and made it necessary
for you to run away
and when you heard
how she cheated you
out of your father money
you decided to kill her
my dear you dont
know what youre saying
mrs dax you mustnt make
wild accusations like that
theyre not wild but i am
accusing andrew of murder
anyway she been here
before and i can prove it
how
because when she came
in archie didnt bark
he knew her look at him now
all animals like me
but that no proof
i wouldnt be
too sure of that
andrew
mr dax
in the
name of the law
why dont you keep quiet
while i talk to the inspector
now im sorry i had to
run out on you inspector
but well ive
been doing a little
research on a
story i thought up
yes mr dax
yes inspector
i have been working very
hard as a matter of fact
ive got quite a headache
and now im on
the last chapter
the one where we have
the grand finale
and the brilliant
amateur solves
the mystery that
baffled the police
that right yeah
but it was really kate
who solved the mystery
andrew did i
yes it was when you told me
not to use that damp tea cloth
and reminded me that
it had been raining
feathers was onto it too
feathers
yes
he saw the snag right away
you see although the body
had been laying outside
her clothes were
still quite dry
that was when the penny dropped
and as for you never
again will i say anything
against a woman intuition
your reconstruction of
the crime was masterly
was it
yes
but not quite right
she hated her sister all
right and she killed her
i mean it was a clever plot
to drive towards the coast
stop on the way commit
the murder and then
imposing on two
complete strangers
dump the body in the shrubbery
to establish an alibi
change clothes with the
corpse during the night
and appear the next day as
her newly arrived sister
the only surviving member
of the tulip family
to claim the estate
and that that is
exactly what you did do
miss millicent tulip
millicent tulip
hit the jackpot in one
splendid off with the disguise
you should have found that out
elementary
go on back on the beat
millicent tulip i arrest you
for the murder of
your sister angela
youre wasting
your time inspector
she as mad as a march hare
it a lie
the march hare is
as sane as i am
cost me a packet
not to be certified
come along with me madam
where are we going
to the station
good i love trains
can we get some tea
oh yes
never drink it
well what are we waiting for
let get cracking
i know
the way i know the way
well how crazy can you get
thank heavens that over
oh yes
now youll be able to finish
your book at last darling
youre supposed to be
writing one remember
oh im not gonna finish that
what
no i got a much better idea
oh no
oh yes
and the title miss
tulip stays the night

and hunted down by the villagers
who fear them

well these are the last two
campaigns for schooner tuna
first you gave away four
glasses with every can of tuna
now as i recall you were
stuck with 60000 of these
right
what is this this is your life
now bear with me
next came 00 free trips to hawaii
now who knew there was gonna
be a hurricane that month
youre stuck with 00000
of these flower lace
i hope to hell youre making a point
well i am making a
point mr humphries
the point is schooner
tuna is one of the three
most expensive tunas on the market
now if we want to beat our competitors
the time for these gimmicks
and giveaways is over with
now i dont mean to be
disrespectful mr humphries
but housewives need your
help not your gimmicks
show them that you really
care about their problems
and youll win their loyalty
now this is what i propose
schooner tuna sympathizes
with those hit so hard
by this trying economy
to help you we are reducing
the price of our tuna by 50 cents a can
when this crisis is over
well go back to our regular prices
until then remember
were all in this together
signed howard humphries president
schooner tuna
the tuna with a heart
well youve got a
plane to catch
im really sorry howard
damn well right youre sorry
yes i am
where in the hell have you

discuss it a little more in
depth
>> thanks curran but i think
ill pass
>> oohim serious
you know marie right
weve got this little study
group going and we both very
much value your input
but i have to say that it
not so much ametaphysical
thing as it were
it really more a hands on
you know
so how about it
would you be interested in a
group learning experience
>> oh come on
it was just a question
>> curran have you ever
stopped to wonder why none of
the little games you play ever
work or do you just figure it

>> hey im only responding to
all your dirty little signals

knows it
>> hmm
let me guessim
a closet nymphomaniac
>> ohah
twice a week you drive a car to
school but then take the subway
home at nightand

you go when you catch the train
>> train rumbling
>> crowd murmuring

continuity and your grades

well it natural
but to just sit at home and
watch the world slip by
>> dad

it good to look for answers
sometimes if you look too
hard you lose the ones you
already have
>> im okay
>> professor the curse of
human consciousness is that it
longs to know only that which
is unknowable
for all our philosophizing can
the meaning of life ever truly
be understood
with exams only two weeks away
let us hope for your sakes
that at least some of it can
>> sighs
>> look curran it not going
to happen okay
not here not on a plane not
in a train
>> laughs
i have my secrets too
laughing
>> you ever hear stories on tv
sometimes that dont make any
sense
maybe a train derails for no
reason or an unexplained fire
breaks out somewhere you know
a mystery
a few years ago police found
out about this invitation
that been sent around
some people got it in their
mail or on their computer even
painted on the side of their
house
the invitation was a riddle
>> what do you mean
>> all i know is the answer led
you to an abandoned building
somewhere in the city
if you could work out where it
was then you became part of a
game and the rules were simple
you begin receiving
riddles--anonymous ones
once you solve them all you
had to do was return to the
building and write the answer
on the wall
if you get a certain number of
them right then one day youd
be shown the design
it this idea riddle freaks
are into you know that all
those unexplainable events out
there that no one can make any
sense out of theyre all just
part of one big riddle we dont
understand
well according to the game if
you played long enough one day
you get a chance to see the
answer to that riddle
this was the calling card of
the game
want to tell me where you got
it from
you really dont want to get
involved
>> uh just a friend
it was a joke
>> funny kind of joke
>> yeah funny kind of guy
believe me
so what happened
you said the cops found out
about it
>> yeah
that woman a few years ago
tried drowning that boy in the
lake--it was all over the news

about it all she would say was
that it was part of the
design

riddle on the wall of the
building
that was it
then one day maybe after one

before it was abandoned
so who was the person who gave

>> well i dont know
he just said some guy
>> just some guy

>> all he said is hed been
given the vip pass for a club
and some kind of password i
never sinned
you know you say the password

>> i never sinned
>> you heard it before
>> woman he was just a little
boy dennis reveni 2 years

>> that one very mixed up
lady
>> something happened to her
vern
straight a through college a
good job a family
she was playing this thing and
she went crazy
>> well let say something
did happen to her
some kind of cult thing maybe
weve got worse things to worry
about here
someone wanted us to find that
body for a reason
>> wellaccording
to her public access file
emily gray was released from an
asylum for the criminally
insane last year
they keep her in a halfway
house just outside toronto now
>> whatever is happening it
aint over
>> police radios
>> on television
in breaking news parts of
toronto university are being
sealed off today as police
investigate a murder
known for the attempted
drowning in 992 of a small
boy emily gray this morning
has confessed to killing a
student from the local
university
>> male reporter why did you
do it emily
>> it all part of the design
>> female reporter police are
refusing all comments until a
psychiatric assessment has been
made
>> still hasnt said anything
>> other than her initial
statementno
and of course her request to
see you
>> we found the body in the
bushes by the library
it had been dragged there from
someplace else
>> officer it been
identified
the victim is who she claims
>> jeff jeremy curran
it was all part of the design
>> in other words her wheel
spinning but the hamster
dead
>> what about her lawyer
>> oh he given clearance for
you to talk to her
he thinks maybe she seen you
on tv before
is making some kind of
connection
>> okay
tom let get a copy of her
character profile
now she phoned it in initially
right
>> mmhm
>> let get a recording of
that too
damned if i know why she
wants to talk to me but i
promise you this she wont ask
twice
>> police radios
>> i know what happening
buddhist monks knew it all
along
what is the sound of one hand
clapping
where does the room go once you
leave it
they believed once you opened
yourself up to enigmas you
began to see the world
differently
you know who the figure on this
card is
well neither did i
so i did some research
>> vern nemesis
>> sara it the closest
translation they found for his
name
he was an indian monk from
around 400 bc
he broke away from his
monastery and studied the way
of enigmas
two years later he was
executed for murder
you want to know how they
caught him
he confessed
>> emily gray
>> nemesis claimed--just
like all the other mysteries of
life--the
murder and his confession could
be understood through the
contemplation of riddles
in the years after his death a
game was developed by his
followers
the players solved riddles and
wrote their answers on the
temple of prayer
when if they were diligent it
was said they would go to write
their answers on the wall only
this time they would find a
riddle waiting there
instead--the final enigma
and if they solved it
>> they would see the design
>> those that saw the design
would then leave more riddles
for others to follow
>> so emily gray tries to drown
the boy after she plays the
game
>> if she had drowned the boy
my guess is she would have
confessed
>> but she failed
so they lock her up
when they finally let her out
she tries again
this time she does kill
someone--your friend
and then confesses
>> just like nemesis
>> sirens wailing
>> vern what are you doing
>> what i should have done from
the start
>> what
you mean the police
first you want to leave them
out of it then when someone
confesses you want to get
involved
>> sara if you hadnt noticed
something not quite right
here
according to your stripper
friend someone tricked curran
into going to that building
it wasnt emily gray
it was a man
someone you know
think about it
the riddle you found in the
subway wasnt random
they had to know who you were
what you were into
they even know about me right
they left the riddle in the
store
whatever going on here it
not just about emily gray
>> we cant go to the cops
>> yeah well watch me
>> vernwhat if it real
what if there something
happening that we cant explain
dont you want to know the
answers
>> you just dont get it do
you
your mother died
im sorry
that messed up
but if youre looking for some
kind of magic potion for your
problems just because you had a
rough ride well guess what
youre not the only one
try watching two of your
friends die in a construction
fire that was you fault
try getting over that in a
hurry
weve withheld evidence of a
murder here
if we dont tell the cops what
happened then our credibility
is gone--and
that all weve got right now
weve got nothing but our word
here
find romeo girl and the word
fear will be here
>> what are you talking about
>> nothing
maybe youre right
maybe we shouldnt go to the
cops
go home
get rid of anything to do with
riddles anything to do with
the game
>> you think we can cover this
up
>> just that part of it
get rid of everything that
connects you to this thing
>> what about you
>> ive got to check something
first
>> hi emily
didnt need to be like this
did it
>> sighs

but you are ever constant
in your changefulness
like that still thread
of falling river
one from source to last embrace
in the still pool
ever-renewed and ever-moving on
from first to last
from first to last
a myriad of water drops
and you i love you for it
are the force that moves
and holds the form
ladies and gentlemen

how many jars of gooseberry jam did

what about a small
informal party 859
my headache kept me from accompanying
randolph to crabb-robinson
for a dinner honoring the poetess
christabel lamotte
he was reluctant to attend without me
i was persistent and persuaded him
ash do you know professor spear
im delighted
mrs jameson
mrs jameson
charmed
miss glover
miss glover
and miss lamotte
miss lamotte
the highest pleasure
randolph reported the party went off
very well indeed
the discussion of poetry
was animated
with miss lamotte speaking more
forcibly than anyone expected
it surprises me that a lady
who lives as quietly as you
would be aware
of my modest success
i am very aware of it
the papers herald you weekly
it is you however who surprise me
why is that
judging from your work im surprised
you acknowledge my existence
or any woman since you show us
such small regard on the page
you cut me madam
then im sorry
i only meant to scratch
hey fergus
hello roland what is it you chaps
always say how it hanging
we usually just say hey
i mean unless youre gay
listen let me ask you
do you know a dr maud bailey
yes i know maud very well
she teaches gender studies at lincoln
would she be helpful im checking out
christabel lamotte a poet from 859
why are you interested
i had some requests about ellen ash
papers and lamotte name came up
the keeper of ellen flame
that bottom of the food chain
but i gotta stay on the food chain
that why i do it
right publish or perish as they say
or in your case perish or perish
so would she this maud bailey
yes but id be careful
why what she like
she thicks men blood with cold
great
if you prefer the american vernacular
she a regular ball-breaker
mr michell
what im sorry
roland michell
yes
youre maud
bailey dr bailey yes
there nothing in my index
no mention of ash at all
ash and lamotte definitely met
when
june 859 at a dinner party given
by crabb-robinson it in his diary
you jump from that to the idea
they corresponded
i found an unfinished letter
to lamotte
no dear madam
but of the three women at that party
lamotte is likeliest
lamotte letters may have something
there arent many from that period
im descended from christabel
im her niece thrice removed
three greats
that what thrice usually means
maybe i shouldnt have come
does seem rather pointless
you could have a look
through blanche diary
who blanche
blanche glover
christabel companion
her lover you look surprised
i didnt know
she was a lesbian
dont get me wrong i like lesbians
unfortunately they didnt have video then
i see why you think it so unlikely
no she could have been bisexual
there no evidence she was but
did you not read before you came
is this an oral exam
i suppose it is
you dont know about her
and yet you make these leaps
you called her a lesbian not me
letters letters letters not for me
letters i am not meant to know or see
thank you jane
you do not have to hide them from me
im not hiding them
you say they are not hidden
but they are
tucked away
as if they were from cupid himself
what does he want
to be my friend
friend
they give what they want a decent name
blanche no
no blanche listen
what we have is ours
no one can change that
it is already changed
find anything
maybe
so what are those bookmarks then
blanche writes about letters letters
that christabel wrote and received
and it nearly drove blanche crazy
where are they
lost destroyed who knows
there lots we havent got
not one of blanche paintings
has ever turned up
so who wrote the letters
weve never verified it but ash
certainly isnt one of the candidates
youve got nothing
i mean it just a thought
ive had many thoughts today
and youve shot them all down
it seems like a bit
of a wild-goose chase to me
id like to do some more reading
i suppose youll wish
to stay overnight
i cant afford to stay
unless i huddle in your doorway
i suppose i could put up with you
for one evening couldnt i
no doubt you know fergus wolfe then
sorry were in the same department
i imagine he told you that were
occasionally on together
no he didnt
what did he
did he say anything about me
no
ill use the bathroom
get out of your way
im just a brush and flush
kind of guy so
forget i said that
maud can i show you something
are these
the originals
how did you get
i stole them
where from
the london library
how could you do that
impulse
impulse ive seen that
take-what-you-want attitude
what in other americans
god what is it with you people
and americans
i know i shouldnt have taken them
i want to find out
if he sent the letter
you dont buy it but blanche
diary suggests that it possible
wouldnt someone have unearthed it
that why it big
potentially so big
well no one has
probably because those
were never sent
are you doing your homework
no i was just writing stuff
stuff for me it nothing
youre a closet poet
more like basement really
just fooling around
so is that what you want to be
no ill be safe and teach
like everybody else
besides there no such thing
as poets anymore
well poet
do you want to see christabel
family home before you go
michell late again
roland asked for another day off
fergus
really where he gone
i didnt ask and he didnt say
he an american
he probably trafficking drugs
did his new discovery
lead to anything
ash vico are you dreaming
vico
no it about christabel lamotte
he went to see dr bailey a woman
lamotte
no
it probably came to nothing
exactly
or he would have told you
wouldnt he
seal court over there
so how long did christabel live there
ages last 20 or so years of her life
excuse me
sorry
to a dusty shelf we aspire
you should drop by seal court
before your train
what do you do in london mr michell
are you a teacher
no not yet im doing a fellowship
which means what
on the dole
my field victorian poetry
we had a poet in this house once
terrible sentimental stuff about god
death the dew and fairies
show this young man
christabel room maud
and why dont you stay tonight
youre under no obligation to stay
just joan way misses our daughter
it quite a drive back
no were fine
hardly ever come up here
with the wheelchair of course
we bunk down on the ground floor
i havent been up here
since i was a child
maud
is this the photograph at your house
yes christabel niece may
my great-great grandmother
christabel wrote dozens of poems
about this place
what are they who haunt our dreams
and weaken our desires
and turn us from a solid face
and in the depth of wintry night
they slumber open-eyed and bright
dolly keeps a secret
safer than a friend
dolly silent sympathy
lasts without end
no rush of action
this is our doom
to live a long life out
in a dark room
maud
it pretty incredible
fergus it me
im out of town tonight on business
id like to ask you about a connection
between christabel and randolph ash
call me on 05-226-3246
roland
roland
no
roland it me it maud
what is it
listen
dolly keeps a secret
safer than a friend
dolly silent sympathy
lasts without end
god
i was so sure
sympathy sympathy sympathy
meaning what
mutual affection or understanding
favor pity or accord that not it
that not it at all
she uses silent sympathy
in a more classical context
like structure or support dolly
conceals it but not within beneath
there a door
i cant believe it
let me see
be careful theyre precious
i will be
we shouldnt be doing this
whyd you drag me up here then
what are you doing
im gonna read
weve got to ask the baileys
ask and youll see these under glass
stop stop all right
can we do it properly
let me get notecards and pencils
all right go go hurry
look at this we got ash
and christabel letters listen
dear miss lamotte
it was a great pleasure to talk to you
at dear crabb-robinson party
may i hope that you too
enjoyed our talk
and may i have the pleasure
of calling on you
she says no
but you may write
would you rather not have a letter
however imperfect
than a plate of cucumber sandwiches
however exquisitely fine cut
you know you would and so would i
i was entranced and moved
by your portrait of your father
i write nonsense
if you write again you shall
have an essay on what you will
yours to command in some things
i was born
christabel lamotte
in a small place too
not like this not bare
a brilliant dusty hutch of mysteries
a cabinet of curiosities
what did my eyes first light on
i am a creature of my pen
my pen is the best part of me
i send you now two more poems
i read your mythic tales of maia and
found them both charming and sad
your verse is rich
but the metaphor is richer
dear mr ash i live circumscribed
and self-communing
it is best so
not like a princess in a thicket
more like a spider in her web
inclined to snap at visitors
or trespassers
not perceiving the distinction until
too late thus it is unwise to call
i know you live very quietly
but i could be very quiet
i only want to discuss dante
shakespeare
wordsworth coleridge goethe
not forgetting of course christabel
lamotte and the ambitious fairy project
sir things flicker and shift
all spangle and sparkle and flashes
i have sat all this long evening by my
fireside turning towards a caving in
the crumbling of the consumed coals
to where i am leading myself
to lifeless dust sir
my dear friend for i may
call myself a friend may i not
i speak to you as i would to any person
who possesses my true thoughts
my thoughts have spent more time in
your company than anyone else lately
where my thoughts are
there am i in truth
my dear friend
it has been borne in upon me
that there are dangers
in our continued conversation
the world would not approve
of letters between a woman living in
shared solitude as i do and a man
even if that man were a great poet
and if one is to live in this way
it imperative to appear respectable
in the eyes of that world and your wife
it is a sealed pact
it is a chosen life in which i
have been wondrously happy
and not alone in being so
i have chosen a way dear friend
i must hold to it
be patient be generous forgive
may i also request that you
return my correspondence
in this way at least our letters
shall remain together
i have known incandescence and must
decline to sample it any further
this goes to the post forgive its faults
and forgive me christabel
my dear christabel your letter came
as a shock to me i will confess
i was at first not only shocked
but angry that you should write so
as you have asked about my wife
however i will tell you
i love ellen
but not as i love you
there are good reasons i cannot discuss
why my love for you may not hurt her
i do not feel i have been
a proper wife to you
without children or any physical
nonsense ellen
nonsense
there are many types of love
all sorts
and ours
that good between us
has been most profound
i must say to you what is in my mind
ive called you my muse and so you are
i could call you
with even greater truth my love
whoa whoa
what
dont do that what
he sends her more letters and she
doesnt answer him she ignores him
typical
no she chose her life with blanche
it not typical it remarkable
i hope this note is the dove
which will return with
the wished-for olive branch
my letters are like noah ravens
they have sped out across the thames
and yet have not returned
i send this note by hand
in the hope you might receive it
where are the letters
theyre gone
i tore them up burned them
and the others from my desk
the same
i beg for us to be as we were
christabel
sweetheart please
this house
so happy once is full of weeping
and wailing and black headaches
i ask myself to whom i may turn
and think of you my friend
the unwitting cause
of all this grief
i shant forget the first glimpse
of your form
illuminated as it was
by flashes of sunlight
i have dreamt nightly of your face
and walked the landscape of my life
with the rhythms of your writing
ringing in my ears
i shall never forget our shining
progress towards one another
never have i felt such a concentration
of my entire being
i cannot let you burn me up
nor can i resist you
no mere human can stand in a fire
and not be consumed
mind reading that last part out
one more time
i cannot let you burn me up
nor can i resist you
no mere human can stand in a fire
and not be consumed
that
yeah
thank you and
and i took your hand
mine rested in yours
with trust and belief
do you have regrets
i should regret venturing out
to crabb-robinson party that evening
i should regret it but i do not
not even in that most sensible
corner of my heart
what are we to do
i do not wish to damage your life
nonetheless i shall be in the church
at noon tomorrow
with what strikes me
as the holiest of prayers
that you should join me
on a journey to yorkshire
a journey out of time
beyond our lives here on earth
this is unbelievable
that was the last one
youre kidding me
no
did she go with him or not
hands up
you two
what this then
there been no harm done george
how do we know
it was very clever of maud
to find your treasure
yes well
must take advice joanie
how long before he takes advice
hell dither around for a while
but not long
blanche diary has nothing
for that period
did ellen keep a journal
yeah in london
but it mostly housewife stuff
gold is in that stuff
we should check it
bailey here
bailey
is that dr heath
no im a friend of maud bailey
is she there
no she isnt
could you get off the line
im expecting the doctor
have you seen roland michell
not since this morning no
but his work went well
the fairy poet
i havent the foggiest idea
do you mean christabel lamotte
get off the line
i looked in ellen diary
and there nothing
but this should cheer you up
it in her correspondence
i wont ask if this is the original
i wouldnt
dear mrs ash i am at present
totally unknown to you
but i have something to impart
to which concerns both of us
and is in my case
a matter of life and death
may i trespass on your time
and come to see you
you would do wrong to keep this
evidence which i send to you now
it is not mine it is also not yours
what i say is true and urgent
as you will see
yours sincerely blanche glover
mrs ash
maybe blanche kept the letters
and showed them to ellen
it all fits beautifully
perhaps both of our departments
should work on this together
is that what you want
do you
no i want to find out what happened
i wanna follow their trail
i need to know
i thought you were mad when you came
to lincoln with your stolen letter
now i feel exactly the same
i havent really thanked you
i mean properly for all of this
i have difficulty with compliments
and such
giving or receiving
both actually
well i wont tell you
youre amazing-looking then
thank you
i wouldnt act on it anyway
with fergus and all
what does and all mean
nothing it just a little problem
that i have socially
do you take anything for it
it not that kind of a problem
it just relationships on the whole
theyre not really for me
anyway
yes
anyway thank you
youre welcome
thank you for agreeing to meet me
you made me rather curious
scotch with just a dash of soda
ill have the same
i wanted to learn of the connection
between ash and christabel lamotte
lamotte and ash
there isnt any
roland michell has made a discovery
with a colleague of mine maud bailey
who is roland michell
blackadder research assistant
american blondish
well he seems to know you
and he thinks it important
does blackadder agree
i dont believe he knows about it
do you wish to be lodged separately
respectably elsewhere from me
i want to be with you
i understood that was
what we had decided
these four weeks only are ours
but ours alone
i hope you will accept this ring
i brought a ring too
you see proof of my resolution
you take my breath away
not yet
no no not yet
shall we go out then to explore
here your bathroom
cupboards
your lovely view
and of course the bed
well look for another hotel
but this is where ash stayed
then well have to share
i can bring up a folding bed
if that your problem
we work together
we were expecting two rooms
im sure it more complicated
than i can imagine
that a lovely brooch
youre wearing miss
it could be one of
isaac greenburg designs
ill get the book
and see if i can tell
where did you get this
ive had it for ages
it was in the family dress-up box
dont you see
ash bought the brooch for ellen
the clasped hands here we know that
and this for christabel
right
so he bought this and said ill have
the eternal embrace for my wife
he wouldnt have said anything
he would have just bought it
it was accepted between them
are you writing fiction now
maybe
but im having fun are you
yes i suppose i am
dont grimace when you say it
it more convincing
i suppose i can be
a touch empirical at times
just a touch
you want to go for a walk
i mean after this
for sure it earlier than the death
of victoria albert probably late 50s
860s maybe
ish
i think were getting
near thomason foss
cropper mentions it
mortimer cropper
ash biographer
all-purpose asshole
he tracked ash entire life
he happy to tell you that
more than happy im sure
you know him
that is beautiful
maud
what
i think christabel did come here
listen
three elements combine
to make the fourth
but above the water and the light
together made
a halo in the darkened cave
that poem is dated 859 july
see if there a cave behind it
that might be all the proof we need
i know it an awfully repressed
english thing to say
but what the hell are you doing
there only one way to find out
of course we could have
just asked someone
i found it
your hands are shaking
are you afraid
no
a little
these are and were there
the garden and the tree
the serpent at its root
the fruit of gold
the woman in the shadow of the boughs
the running water and the grassy space
they are and were there
i dont mind that
see you could grow to like ash
yes he sort of
a soft-core misogynist
why do you always tie
your hair up like that
it to do with fergus wolfe mostly
fergus how to do with fergus
when we met he drove me mad
quoting yeats
who could love you for yourself alone
and not your yellow hair
then i was accused by feminists at a
conference of dyeing it to attract men
really
yes
so i shaved it off all of it
and did he
did who what
fergus love you
without your yellow hair
no
with or without
i dont even like him
but i cant seem to
it freud
on the other side of attraction
lies repulsion
or was that calvin klein
do you believe that
i wouldnt know
i dont allow myself to do that
ash-christabel grand passion thing
allow
no
jealousy obsession all that
not anymore
youre lucky then
it all gets so
just such a tangle
it a tangle most people want
not me though
my antics made
a lot of people unhappy
one horribly so
for me
whenever i feel anything
for anyone
i go cold all over
what makes you do that
fear i suppose
fear of being burned up by love
listen to us
yes
arent we just modern
maud you should let your hair out
you should let it breathe
dont do the icy thing you have
nothing to worry about from me
christabel said fear all men
yeah well christabel didnt know me
i dont want to take anything from you
so then were both
perfectly safe
right
how can we bear it
every day we will have less
would you rather have had nothing
oh no
i thank god that if there
had to be a dragon it was you
wait
wait
i was trying to get out from the covers
no
we shouldnt be doing this
it dangerous
i dont
because i like you i like you a lot
i just dont want to blow it here
it doesnt matter to me honestly
what do you mean
it all right were probably just
these cramped quarters
it was a mistake
i didnt mean that
let not beat the thing dead
it happened it over were adults
speak for yourself
i cant imagine what youre like after
you actually sleep with someone
maud i think that you are very
you know
no i dont know
so were friends now is that it
yeah but that a lot
i agree it fine
yeah
it perfect
anyway were getting off the track
we came to investigate them
not us
so whatever happened to blanche
blanche drowned
where was christabel
we dont know where she was
the year before is a bit blank too
that entire year
there speculation she went to france
but ive nothing to support that
okay so
christabel comes here with ash
then disappears on paper at least
yes
and blanche suicides
jesus
what are you doing
it a poem ive been writing
youre not pleased with it
on the contrary i think it perfectly
expresses the joy i have felt with you
then why that
these feelings
i want them to survive
i know i can never declare
all this
this love
there ive said it i know it cannot
be declared to the world
all i may do is scatter these words from
the train and hope that they take root
they will flourish i swear it
so what next i mean for you
ill check the archives to see where
christabel might have been that year
good
i guess ill just
i dont know
go look up shit on the microfiche
suffer over you
goodbye
see you
lost your way dont do tours here
sir george bailey
who wants to know
professor cropper
curator of the stant collection
robert owen university
in new mexico
and this is dr wolfe
im a busy man my wife ill
i can quite understand that sir
i believe you may be in possession
of some documents
by randolph henry ash
dont shoot
get off my land
do you have any idea
what were talking about
do you have any idea how much
such pieces if they existed
how much they would be worth
worth
mind if we swing past the university
bit of unfinished business
miss bailey i presume
the accomplice
the very same
god youre like bonnie and clyde
i needed a picture of her
ive never seen you like this
just go
take the porsche and go
fergus what
if fergus went out to get indian food
im gonna feel really stupid

india wouldnt be
far enough away actually
come inside ill explain
you sure i mean
about me coming in
yes very
i left fergus a message
from seal court
which put him on our trail
and he came here looking for answers
he and cropper from the sound of it
so that was cropper car outside
i think fergus found something
he been spooking around the museum
sending out a bunch of faxes
i wouldnt be so quick to do that
the british museum fax log sheet
to university of nantes from wolfe
subject christabel lamotte
information on lamotte genealogy
request journal of sabine de kercoz
unfortunately for fergus
we have to log our faxes
youre shameless
so what are we gonna do now
are we gonna try
to beat him to france or
or are we just gonna
stare at each other
that is the question isnt it
i have another one for you
what that
what are you really doing here
i needed to see your face
i just want to let you know
whatever happened in whitby
which unfortunately
was not much
it not because anything
that you did
not at all
i just didnt want
to jump into something
i mean i did and i do
want to
badly
i just didnt want to mess this up
and i just want to see
i want to see if there an us
in you and me
would you like that
ill take that as a yes
when will she be back
could you check for us
she will return on thursday
what about you and your shoplifting
i cant take you anywhere
dear professor wolfe
i have made another discovery
among sabine papers was her journal
she writes about lamotte visit
to brittany in 859
and the subsequent arrival
of a mysterious visitor
i know how things are
i wish to help you
you know tell me cousin sabine
how do you think things are with me
i am a grown woman you are a girl
i do not desire any help from you
christabel condition became worse
after she received word from london
that her close friend had died
she left england
because she was pregnant
and blanche committed suicide
what happened to the baby
mustve been stillborn or died
maybe it was taken in by a local family
and brought up here
id like to think that
but i wonder
you wonder what
i dont know i just
she comes here alone
hears that blanche has killed herself
she pregnant distraught
i mean ive no evidence for it
can you imagine how she felt
yes i can
so when do we see christabel next
autumn 860 in the references
to the vestal lights
it was a group of women who
met with mediums regularly
really you know ash
hated spiritualists pretty openly
is it a connection worth tracking down
i dont know
please make a circle with your hands
close your eyes
white earth valley
waterfall
child laughing
two people
deception
letters
two people
words
death
what have you done
a field
where is the child
what have you done with the child
you have made a murderess of me
i understood that mr ash was inquiring
about the spirit of his departed child
but i am told that this could not be
the case as mr ash is childless
was there any mention
of hella lees in your research
i dont know
nor do i care
look ive got to get back
what going on
nothing im just tired i should
come on what wrong seriously
i dont actually want to discover
anything else about them
do you know
im finding things out
that are
it horrible when you think about it
really men and women together
she gave up her life didnt she
a perfectly decent life ive always
admired and for what for nothing
not nothing
really for what then
a child who died a lover drowned
and to what end
she and ash my own parents
and every relationship ive ever had
it all doomed we cant seem to help
but just tear each other apart
well what about us you didnt
include us what about that
look l
i cant think about anything right now
so okay so this is the icy
pull back part then
what
you get close you pull away you get
it the pattern right
what are you talking about
your fear men mantra from yorkshire
that what im talking about
if that the way you play it
that the way you play it
do you honestly believe that
is that what you think this is to me
a game
is it
all this talk of us
really comes to nothing doesnt it
yes i guess youre right
it nothing
dear professor blackadder
i did try to tell you
about my discovery before
but found that i couldnt
please read these two letters
and you will begin to understand
im sorry for deceiving you
sincerely
roland michell
it well-documented that ellen
set a box on ash coffin
a sealed container wed always
imagined it was just trinkets
but in light of michell discovery
who knows what may be in it
morally that box is mine
once you become lord ash
it absolutely yours
until then we keep it secret then you
discover it among old lord ash things
then i purchase it from you it all
aboveboard no one the wiser
cropper you absolutely sure of that
where is it
i place this letter in his hands
and if ghouls dig it up again
then perhaps justice will be done
when i am not here to see it
dear madam
we are older now
and my fires at last are out
i know that you are
more than aware of my name
but i find you must see it
in print one last time
it has been made known to me
that your husband is near to death
so i have writ down
for his eyes only some things
i find i cannot say what things
and have sealed the letter
if you wish to read it
it is in your hands
though i must hope
that he will see it first and decide
i have done great harm
though i meant none to you
ill see they get back
no questions asked
youre more enterprising
than i gave you credit for
was there a compliment
in there somewhere
yes probably
what i cant believe is fergus wolfe
conniving with cropper
i thought i was a better judge of men
that where you went wrong
you gave him credit for being one
thank you
thanks for coming
sure
i believe that may be her
im sorry i lost it totally
no im sorry honestly it wasnt you
so why dont we all talk
some strategy
let me introduce you to
professor blackadder paola
this is dr bailey
maud
how do you do
so do we really think that cropper
capable of robbing a grave
the idea of opening a grave creepy
let just keep going
jesus
moping owl doth to moon complain
are you ready
hold the light up
fergus fergus
that it
yes it gotta be
i found it fergus i found it
oh my god
i found it fergus
great
hey cropper
cropper
this has nothing to do
with you people
get off of me get off
no you dont
you traitor you bloody conniver
what are you doing
are you sure we should do this
i said wed take a look
before we handed it over
to the museum
can you hold that there
maud look at this
it her handwriting
my dear my dear
they tell me you are very ill
perhaps i am wrong to disturb you at
this time with unseasonable memories
but i find i have
after all a thing
which i must tell you
you will say it shouldve been told
20 years ago but i could or would not
you have a daughter
who is well and married
and the mother of a beautiful boy
i sent you her picture
you will see she resembles
both her parents
neither of whom she knows
to be her parent
when i said at that terrible sance
that you had made a murderess of me
i was speaking of poor blanche
whose end torments me daily
and i thought let him think so then
if he knows me so little
i had a secret fear you see
i was afraid you would take her
you and your wife for your own
but i could not let her go
and so i hid her from you
and you from her
she loves her adoptive parents
most deeply
me she does not love
so i am punished living at seal court
with them and watching her grow
i have been angry
for so long with all of us
and now near the end
i think of you again with clear love
did we not
did you not flame and i catch fire
was not the love that we found
worth the tempest that it brought
i feel it was i know it was
if you are able please send me a sign
that you have read this
i dare not ask if you forgive
christabel lamotte
ash never read this
he never knew he had a child
youre descended from
both christabel and ash
my god
all these clues
theyre for you
for us
youre so beautiful
there are things that happen
not spoken or written of
a poet walked out
one summer day
seeking forgiveness
from a love long lost
he found something else instead
this is how it was
morning
good morning
what your name
may bailey but i have
another name i dont like
do you
what that
maia thomason bailey
well
maia was the
the mother of hermes
and i know a waterfall called thomason
a waterfall really
yes in yorkshire
with a lovely cave hidden behind it
where do you live
i live in the house there
and my mother lives there
and my father and my two brothers
and my aunt christabel too
yes i think i know your mother
you have the true look of her
no one else says that
i think i look like my father
you look like your father too
can you make daisy chains
yes
yes ill make you a crown
but
would you give me
a lock of your hair
like fairy story
just so
now
would you take this note

ive got to think of
a defense for you
theyre practically
love letters
rather racy actually
see ash
supposedly never even looked
at another woman
i mean not even glanced at one
his entire marriage
can you imagine what would happen if i could prove
that mr perfect husband
had this like
shakespearean-type
dark lady thing going
darling the duck done
would you be a sweetheart
and do the sauce
yes yes
duck huh
yeah peking
it from around the corner

ro-land

discovered 20 times already
i dont think so

how many jars
of gooseberry jam

hmm this is not
a job for a grown-up
gooseberry
cooking
gooseberry jam
cooking 42
what about a small
informal party
my headache
last night prevented me
from accompanying randolph
to dear crabb-robinson
for a dinner honoring
the poetess christabel lamotte
he was reluctant
to attend without me
but i was persistent
and finally persuaded him
ash do you know
professor spear
im delighted
mrs jameson
mrs jameson
charmed
miss glover
oh miss glover
and miss lamotte
miss lamotte
the highest pleasure
randolph reported the party
went off very well indeed
the discussion of poetry
was animated
with miss lamotte speaking more forcibly than anyone expected
surprises me madame
that a lady who lives as quietly as you do
wouldnt be aware
of my modest success
oh im very aware that the papers herald you weekly
it is you however
who surprise me
and why is that
judging from your work
im surprised youd even
acknowledge my existence
or any woman
for that matter
since you show us such
small regard on the page
you cut me madame
im sorry
i only meant to scratch
hey fergus
ah hello roland
what is it you chaps always say
how it hanging
well we usually just say hey
unless youre gay
oh
listen
let me ask you
something
do you know
a dr maud bailey
maud oh yes
i know maud very well
she teaches gender studies
at lincoln
oh would she
be helpful
im checking out
christabel lamotte
she a poet writing
around about 859
yes yes why would you
be interested in her
oh nothing
it just i had some requests about ellen ash papers
but lamotte name
came up so--
god the keeper
of ellen flame
i mean that the bottom
of the food chain old sport
yeah but i got to stay on the food chain
old sport that why i do it
right well publish or perish
as they say
or in your case
perish or perish
so would she--
this maud bailey person
oh yes but id be careful
if i were you
why what she like
well she thicks
men blood with cold
oh great
or if you prefer the american vernacular
she a regular
ball-breaker
mr michell
what im sorry
roland michell
yes
youre maud
bailey dr bailey yes
there nothing in my index
no mention of ash at all
well ash and lamotte
definitely met
really when
june 859
at a dinner party
given by crabb-robinson
it in his diary
and you jumped from that to the idea that they corresponded
i found an unfinished draft
of a letter in a book--
addressed to lamotte
no just dear madame
but there were three women at crabb-robinson dinner party
and out of the three
it likeliest to be lamotte
so maybe there something
in lamotte letters
there arent many from
the richmond period--
the time youre
interested in
im descended from
christabel actually
im her niece
thrice removed
three grades
that what thrice usually means
oh maybe
i shouldnt have come
it does seem
rather pointless
well i suppose
since youre here
you could have a look
through blanche diary
who blanche
blanche glover
christabel companion
her lover
oh you look surprised
i didnt know she was-didnt know she was a lesbian
no i mean dont get me wrong
i like lesbians
yes well unfortunately
they didnt have
video cameras in those days
so youre out of luck
now i see why you think
it so unlikely
not from that point of view
i mean god she could
have been bisexual
there no evidence she was
but in theory--
did you not do any reading
before you came
is this like an oral exam
yes i suppose it is
i mean you dont know
the first thing about her
and yet you make
these leaps
hey youre the one who called her a lesbian
not me
letters letters letters
not for me
letters i am not meant
to know or see
thank you jane
you do not have to hide them from me
im not hiding them
you say they are not hidden
but they are
tucked away
as if they were from cupid himself
what does he want
to be my friend
friend
they always try and give
what they want a decent name
blanche no
no blanche listen
what we have
is ours
no one can change that
tis already changed
find anything
maybe
so what are
those bookmarks then
blanche writes about letters
letters letters that christabel
wrote and received
and it nearly
drove blanche crazy
where are they
lost destroyed who knows
there lots we havent got
not one of blanche paintings has ever turned up
for instance
so who do you think
wrote the letters
weve never been able
to verify who he was
but ash certainly isnt
one of the candidates
youve got nothing
i mean
it just a thought
of course ive thrown out
a lot of thoughts today
and youve pretty much
shot them all down so--
yes well
it seems like a bit of a wild-goose chase to me
id like to do
some more reading
i suppose youll wish to
stay here overnight then
well i cant really afford
to stay overnight
unless you want me huddled
downstairs in your doorway
i suppose i could put up with you for one evening
couldnt i
no doubt you know
fergus wolfe then
im sorry uh yeah
were in the same department
i imagine that
he told you that were
occasionally
on together
no he didnt
what did he--
did he say anything
about me
uh--
no
right ill use the bathroom first
get out of your way
please
im just sort of a brush and flush kind of guy so--
forget i said that
maud
can i show you something
are these-how did you get-those are the originals
i took them
i sort of stole them took them
where from
the london library
how could you do that
it was on impulse
impulse
right
ive seen that take-what-you-want attitude in other--
what in other americans
god what is it with
you people and americans
look i know that i shouldnt have taken them
i know that
but maud i want to
find out what happened
did he or didnt he
send the letter
you might not buy into
my theory but to me
blanche diary suggests
that it possible
wouldnt someone have unearthed a thing like this
that what makes it so big
potentially so big
well no one has
probably because those were never sent
are you doing your homework
no im just
writing stuff
stuff for me
it nothing
youre a closet poet
uh
more like basement
really
im just uh
just fooling around
is that what you want to be when you grow up
no im gonna be safe and teach like everybody else
besides there no such thing as poets anymore
well poet
do you want to see christabel family home before you go
michell late again
roland asked for
another day off fergus
oh really
where he gone
i didnt ask
and he didnt say
he an american
for god sake
he probably off
trafficking drugs
did his new discovery
lead to anything
ash vico--
are you dreaming
vico no no
this had something to do
with christabel lamotte
he went to see dr bailey
in lincoln-a woman
lamotte hmm no
well it probably came to nothing then
exactly
or he would
have told you
wouldnt he
seal court
over there
so how long did christabel live at this seal court place
ages the last 20
or so years of her life
excuse me
sorry
to a dusty shelf
we aspire
you should drop by seal court
before the train
and what do you do
in london mr michell
are you a teacher as well
no not yet im doing a fellowship
which means what exactly
on the dole
um my field
victorian poetry
we had a sort of poet
in this house once
terrible sentimental stuff
about god and death
and the dew and fairies
why dont you show this young man christabel room maud
and why dont you
stay tonight
youre under no obligation
to stay of course
it just joan way
misses our daughter
quite a drive back actually
no were fine
oh well
hardly ever come up here
with the wheelchair of course
we bunk down on the ground floor
i havent been up here
since i was a child
maud is this the photograph
at your house
yes that
christabel niece may
that my
great-great-grandmother
christabel wrote dozens
of poems about this place
what are
they who haunt our dreams
and weaken our desires
and turn us
from a solid face
and in the depth
of wintery night
they slumber
in the night and bright
dolly keeps a secret
safer than a friend
dolly silent sympathy
lasts without end
no rush of action
this is our doom
to live a long life out
in a dark room
maud
it pretty
incredible huh
fergus it me
i-im out of town tonight
on business
ive stumbled
onto a connection
between christabel
and randolph ash
and have a few questions
for you
call me on 05-2263-246
roland
roland
roland roland
no
roland it me
it maud
what is it
listen
dolly keeps a secret
safer than a friend
dolly silent sympathy
lasts without end
god
i was so sure
sympathy
sympathy
sympathy meaning what
mutual affection
or understanding
favor pity or even accord
but that not it is it
that not it at all
she uses silent sympathy
in a more classical context
like structural support
dolly conceals it
yes but not within
beneath
there a door
there a door
i cant believe it
let me see
be-be careful theyre very precious
ill be very careful
oh god we shouldnt
be doing this
what do you mean
we shouldnt be doing this
whyd you drag me
up here then
what are you doing
im going to read
stop weve got to
ask the baileys
you ask
and the next time
you see these is
under glass in new mexico
stop it
stop stop stop
all right all right
put-can we please
at least do it properly
let me run downstairs and get some note cards and some pencils
all right
go go hurry
look at this
weve got ash and christabel letters here
look come here
listen what
dear miss lamotte
it was a great pleasure
to talk to you
at dear
crabb-robinson party
may i hope that you too
enjoyed our talk
and may i have the pleasure
of calling on you
she says no
but you may write
would you rather not have a letter
however imperfect
than a plate
of cucumber sandwiches
however exquisitely
fine cut
know you would
and so would i
i was entranced and moved by your brief portrait of your father
i write nonsense
but if you cant write again
you shall have a sober essay
on what you will
yours to command
in some things
where i was born
christabel lamotte
was a small place too
not like this
not bare
a brilliant dusty hutch
of mysteries
a cabinet of curiosities
what did my eyes
first light on
i am a creature of my pen
my pen is
the best part of me
i send you now
two more poems
i eagerly read
your mythic tales of mire
and found them
both charming and sad
your verse is rich
but perhaps the metaphor is richer
dear mr ash
i live circumscribed
and self-communing
it is best so
not like a princess
in the thicket
more like a spider
in her web
inclined to snap at visitors
or trespassers
not perceiving the distinction
until too late
thus it is unwise to call
i know you live very quietly
but i could be
very quiet
i only want to discuss
dante and shakespeare
wordsworth and coleridge
and goethe
not forgetting of course
christabel lamotte
and the ambitious
fairy project
oh sir things flicker
and shift
all spangle and sparkle
and flashes
i have sat all this long evening
by my fireside
turning towards
a caving in
the crumbling
of the consumed coals
to where i am leading myself--
to lifeless dust sir
my dear friend--
for i may call myself
a friend may i not
i speak to you as i would
speak to any person
who possesses
my true thoughts
for my true thoughts have spent more time in your company
than in anyone else
these last few weeks
where my thoughts are
there am i in truth
my dear friend
it has been borne in upon me
that there are dangers
in our continued conversation
the world would not look well
upon letters
between a woman living
in shared solitude as i do
and a man
even if that man
were a great poet
and if one is to live
in this way
it is imperative to appear respectable in the eyes of that world
and your wife
it is a sealed pact
it is a chosen way of life in which i have been wondrously happy
and not alone in being so
i have chosen a way
dear friend
i must hold to it
be patient
be generous forgive
may i also request that you return my correspondence to me
in this way
at least our letters will remain together
i have known incandescence
and must decline
to sample it any further
this now goes to the post
forgive its faults
and forgive me christabel
my dear christabel
your letter came as a shock
to me i will confess
i was at first
not only shocked
but angry that
you should write so
as youve asked
about my wife
however i will tell you
i love ellen
but not as i love you
there are good reasons
which i cannot discuss
why my love for you
may not hurt her
i do not feel
i have been
a proper wife
to you randolph
without children
without ever
any kind of physical--
nonsense ellen
nonsense
there are many
types of love
all sorts
and ours
are good between us
it has been
most profound
i must say to you
what is in my mind
i have called you my muse
and so you are
i could call you
with even greater truth
my love
whoa whoa whoa what
what dont do that what
so he sends his response
he sends her more letters
she doesnt answer them
she ignores them
typical
no she-she chose her life
with blanche
it not typical
it remarkable
i shall hope against hope
that this note is the dove
which will return with
the wished-for olive branch
my letters are like noah ravens-they
have sped out across the thames
they have sped out across the thames and yet have not returned
i send this note by hand in the hope that you might receive it
where are the letters
theyre gone
i tore them up
i burned them
and the others
from my desk
the same
i beg for us to be as we were christabel
sweetheart please
this house so happy once
is full of weeping and wailing
and black headaches
i ask myself
to whom i may turn
and think of you
my friend--
the unwitting cause
of all this grief
i shant forget the first
glimpse of your form
illuminated as it was
by flashes of sunlight
i have dreamt nightly
of your face
and walked the landscape
of my life with the rhythms
of your writing
ringing in my ears
i shall never forget
our shining progress
towards one another
never have i felt such a concentration of my entire being
i cannot let you
burn me up
nor can i resist you
no mere human can stand in a fire and not be consumed
you mind reading that last part out one more time
i cannot let you
burn me up
nor can i resist you
no mere human
can stand in a fire
and not be consumed
that
yeah
thank you and--
and i took your hand
mine rested in yours
with trust and relief
do you have regrets
i should regret venturing out to crabb-robinson party that evening
i should regret it
but i do not
not even in that most sensible corner of my heart
what are we to do
i do not wish to
damage your life
nonetheless i shall be in the church at noon tomorrow
with what strikes me
as the holiest of prayers
that you should join me
on a journey to yorkshire
and journey out of time beyond our lives here on earth
this is unbelievable
that was the last one
youre kidding me
no
well did she go with him or not
hands up
you two
what this then
there been no harm done george
how do we know
if harm been done
i think it was very clever
of maud to find your treasure
yes well must
take advice joanie
how long before sir george
takes advice
hell dither around for
a while but not long
blanche diary has nothing
for that period
what about ellen ash
did she keep a journal
yeah in london
but it mostly just boring housewife stuff
god is in the boring housewife stuff
we should check it
bailey here
bailey
is that dr heath
no um im a friend
of maud bailey
i was wondering
is she there
no she isnt could you get off the line
im expecting the doctor
oh um have you seen
roland michell
not since
this morning no
but his work
went well did it
the fairy poem
i havent the foggiest idea
do you mean
christabel lamotte
get off the line
i looked in ellen diary
there nothing
but uh this should
cheer you up
it in her correspondence
im not going to ask
if this is the original
i wouldnt
dear mrs ash
im at present
totally unknown to you
but i have something
to impart to which
closely concerns both of us and is in my case a matter of life and death
may i trespass on your time
and come to see you
you would do wrong to keep this evidence which i send to you now
it is not mine;
it is also not yours
what i say is true and urgent
as you will come to see
yours sincerely
blanche glover
mrs ash
maybe blanche didnt tear the letters but
kept them and showed them to ellen
it all fits beautifully
well perhaps um
both of our departments should work on this together
is that what you want
i dont know do you
no i wanna go after them
i wanna find out what happened
i wanna go to yorkshire and follow their trail
i need to know
i thought you were mad when you
came to lincoln with your stolen letter
now i feel
exactly the same
i havent really thanked you
i mean properly
for all of this
i have difficulty
with compliments and such
giving or receiving
both actually
well i wont tell you
youre amazing-looking then
youre probably sick of hearing it
thank you it--
im the last guy whod act on it
with fergus and all
what does and all mean
nothing
just a little problem
that i have socially
do you take anything for it
it not that kind
of a problem
it just relationships on the whole
theyre not really for me
anyway--
yes
anyway thank you
youre welcome
thank you for agreeing
to meet me professor
well you made me rather curious
drink sir
scotch with
just a dash of soda
sir thank you
uh ill have the same thank you
um i wanted to learn
of the connection
between ash
and christabel lamotte
lamotte and ash
there isnt any
well roland michell
has made a discovery
with a colleague of mine
maud bailey
im sorry
who the hell is roland michell
oh blackadder research assistant
american
blondish well anyway
he seems to know you
and he thinks
it important
and does blackadder agree
i dont believe
he knows anything about it
do you wish to be
lunched separately
respectably
elsewhere from me
i want to be with you
i understood that was
what we had decided
these four weeks
only are ours
but ours alone
oh i uh--
i hope you will
accept this ring
i have brought a ring too
you see
proof of my resolution
you take my breath away
not yet
no not yet
shall we go out
then to explore
there your bathroom
cupboard
your lovely view
and of course the bed
well look
for another hotel
but this is
where ash stayed
then well have
to share a room
i can bring up
a folding bed
for one of you
if that your problem
we work together actually
it not--
we were expecting two rooms
right
im sure it more complicated
than i can imagine
that a lovely brooch
youre wearing miss
i reckon it could be one of
issac greenberg designs
ill uh get the book
and see if i can tell
where did you get this
ive had it for ages
it was in the family dress-up box
dont you see
ash bought the brooch for ellen
the clasped hands
here in whitby we know that
and this for christabel
oh right
so while he was buying this
he said um
yes ill have the eternal embrace for my wife
no he wouldnt have
said anything
he would have just
bought the brooch
christabel
would have seen
it was accepted
between them
are you writing
fiction now
maybe
im having fun
are you
yes i suppose i am
dont grimace when you say it
it more convincing
i suppose
i can be a touch
empirical at times
just a touch
hey you wanna go for a walk or something
i mean
out in the hills
for sure it earlier than the death of victoria albert
probably late 50s
860s maybe
ish
i think were getting
near thomason falls
cropper mentions it--
mortimer cropper
yeah ash biographer
all-purpose asshole
he literally trekked
every step of ash life
he happy to tell you that too
more than happy im sure
you know him huh
that is beautiful
maud what
i think christabel
did come here
listen
three elements combined
to make the fourth
but above the water and the light
together made
a halo
in the darkened cave
that poem dated
859 july
see if there
a cave behind it
that might be all
the proof we need
ah--
i know this is an awfully repressed sort of english thing to say
but what the hell
are you doing
there only one way
to find out
of course we could
have just asked someone
whoo maud maud
i found it
your hands are shaking
are you afraid
no
a little
these are and were there
the garden and the tree
the serpent at its root
the fruit of gold the woman
in the shadow of the boughs
the running water
and the grassy space
they are and were there
i dont mind that
see you could grow
to like ash
yes
he sort of a soft-core
misogynist
why do you always
tie your hair up like that
it has to do
with fergus wolfe mostly
fergus
how to do with fergus
when we met
he drove me mad quoting yeats
who could love you for yourself alone and not your yellow hair
yes
and then i was accused once by my sister feminists at a conference
of dyeing it
to attract men
really
yes
so i shaved it off
all of it
and did he
did who what
fergus love you without your yellow hair
no
we fought about it
we drive each other mad
i dont even like him
but i cant seem to--
freud
on the other side of attraction
lies repulsion
or was that calvin klein
do you believe that
uh i wouldnt know
i dont really
allow myself to do
that ash/christabel
grand passion kind of thing
allow
yeah
jealousy obsession
all that not anymore
youre lucky then
it all gets so--
just such a tangle
it a tangle
most people want
not me though
my antics made a lot
of people unhappy
one horribly so
for me
whenever i feel
anything for anyone i--
i go cold all over
what makes you do that
fear i suppose
fear of being burned up
by love
listen to us
yes arent we just maudlin
maud you should
let your hair out
you should let it breathe
and dont do the ice thing
cause you have nothing
to worry about from me
christabel said
fear all men
well christabel
didnt know me
i dont want to take
anything from you
so then were both
perfectly safe
right
how can we bear it
every day
we will have less
would you rather
have had nothing
no
i thank god that if there had to be a dragon it was you
wait wait
no i was just trying to get out from under the covers
no no
this is-we shouldnt be doing this
it dangerous
well i really-no because i like you
i like you a lot
i just dont want
to blow it here and--
well it doesnt matter
to me honestly
what do you mean
it doesnt matter
sorry i think
were probably just--
in these cramped quarters
it was a mistake
maud maud
i didnt mean that
let not beat
the thing dead
it happened it over
and were adults
speak for yourself
i cant imagine what youre like after you actually sleep with someone
maud i think
that you are very--
you know
no i dont know
so what were friends
now is that it
yeah that a lot
no i agree
it fine
yeah it perfect
anyway were getting
off the track here
we came to investigate
them not us
so what ever happened to blanche
blanche drowned
oh
where was christabel
we dont know where she was
the year before
a bit blank too
you dont know where she was
that entire year
there some speculation
that she went to france
but i have nothing
to support that
okay so
christabel
comes here with ash
and then disappears
on paper at least
yes
and blanche suicides
jesus
what are you doing
it a poem
ive been writing it as ive watched you
youre not pleased with it
on the contrary
i think it perfectly expresses the joy i have felt with you
then why that
these feelings--
i want them to survive
i know i can never
declare all this--
this love
there ive said it
i know it cannot be declared to the world
what i may do is scatter
these words from the train
and hope that
they somehow take root
they will flourish
i swear it
so what next
i mean for you
i suppose ill check
through the archives
and see if there any clue at all where
christabel might have been that year
good
i guess ill just uh--
hell i dont know--
go look up shit
on the microfiche
suffer over you
good-bye
see ya
lost your way
dont do tours here
sir george bailey
who wants to know
professor mortimer cropper
curator of the stan collection
robert de leon university
harmony city new mexico
and this is dr wolfe
good morning
im a busy man
my wife ill
i can quite understand
that sir
sources have led me to believe
that you may be in possession
of some documentation
by randolph henry ash
whoa
dont shoot please
get off my land
do you have any idea
what were talking about here
do you do you have
any idea how much
such pieces
if they existed
how much
they would be worth
worth
do you mind if we swing
past the university
bit of unfinished
business
miss bailey i presume
the accomplice
the very same
good god youre
like bonnie and clyde
come on
i need a picture of her
ive never seen you
like this just go
take the porsche
and go
fergus what
uh if fergus went out
to get indian food
im gonna--
im gonna feel really stupid
no he didnt
india wouldnt be
far enough away actually
come inside ill explain
you sure i mean
about me coming in
yes very
so i left fergus a message
from seal court
which apparently
put him on our trail
and he came here looking
for answers--
he and cropper
from the sound of it
so that was cropper
car outside
i think fergus
has found something
he been spooking
around the museum
sending out
a bunch of faxes
ah--
i wouldnt be
so quick to do that
yeah
the british museum
fax log sheet
to university of nantes
from fergus wolfe
subject christabel lamotte
information on lamotte genealogy
request loan of journal
of sabine de concasse
unfortunately for fergus
we have to log our faxes
youre shameless
so what are we
gonna do now
we gonna try to beat em
to france or--
or are we just
gonna stare at each other
that is the question
isnt it
mm-hmm
i have another one for you
what that
what are you really
doing here
well i uh--
i needed to see your face
i just want to let you know that whatever happened in whitby
which unfortunately
was not much
it not because
anything that you did
not at all
i just didnt want
to jump into something
i mean i did
and i do want to
badly
i just didnt
want to mess this up
and i just want to see--
i want to see if there
an us in you and me
would-would you like that
ill take that
as a yes
ah oui excusez-moi
nous sommes confrères
when will she be back
could you check for us
she will return on thursday
okay
au revoir
merci
you and your shoplifting huh
i cant take you anywhere
dear professor wolfe since i wrote to you last
ive made another discovery
amongst sabine papers
was her journal
in which she writes about lamotte visit to brittany in 859
and the subsequent arrival
of a mysterious visitor
i know how things are
i wish to help you
you know how things are do you
tell me cousin sabine
how do you think
things are with me
im a grown woman
you are a girl
i do not desire
any help from you
christabel condition
became worse
after she received word
from london
that her close friend
had died
she left england
because she was pregnant
and blanche
committed suicide
what happened to the baby
it must have been stillborn
or died
maybe it was taken in
by nuns or a local family
and brought up here
id like to think that
but i wonder
you wonder what
i dont know i just--
she comes here alone hears
that blanche has killed herself
she pregnant distraught
geez
i mean ive no
evidence for it
can you imagine
how she must have felt
yes i can
so when do we see
christabel next
autumn 860
in her references to the vestal lights
it was a group of women who used to
meet with mediums on a regular basis
really you know
ash hated spiritualists pretty openly
you think that a connection worth tracking down
i dont know
please make a circle
with your hands
close your eyes
white earth valley
a waterfall
a child love
two people deception
letters two people
words death
what have you done
a field
where is the child
what have you done
with the child
you have made
a murderess of me
i understood at the time
that mr ash was inquiring
after the spirit of
a departed child of his own
but i am told that
this could not be the case
as mr ash is childless
was there any mention
of heloise in your research
i dont know
nor do i care
look ive got to get back
what going on nothing
im just tired that all so i should--
come on
what wrong seriously
i dont actually want to discover anything else about them
you know
im finding things out
that are just--
it horrible when you think about it really-men and women together
she gave up her life
didnt she
a perfectly decent life that ive always admired
and for what for nothing
no not nothing
oh really for what then a child who died
a lover drowned and to what end
she and ash
my own parents
and every relationship
ive ever had--
it all doomed
we cant seem to help
but just tear
each other apart
well what about us
you didnt include us what about that
look i--
i cant think about
anything right now
so okay
so this is the
uh-this is the icy pull-back part then huh
what
you know you get close you pull away you get--
i mean this is part
of the pattern right
what are you talking about
your fear of men mantra from yorkshire
that what
im talking about
no i get it
it cool
that the way
you play it
do you honestly
believe that
is that what you think
this is to me a game is it
well finally then
all this talk of us
really comes to nothing
doesnt it
yes i guess youre right
it nothing
dear professor blackadder
i did try to tell you
about my discovery before
but found that i couldnt
please read these two letters
and you will begin
to understand
im sorry for deceiving you
sincerely roland michell
and it well documented that ellen ash set a box on ash coffin--
a kind of sealed container
wed always imagined
it was just trinkets
but in the light
of michell discovery
who knows what treasures
might be buried there
that box is mine isnt it
it my property
once you get it from lord ash
it absolutely yours
until then
we keep it a secret
any discovery amongst
lord ash things
and uh--
and i purchase it from you
it all above board
no one the wiser
cropper are you
absolutely sure of that
listen
uh where is it
yeah i place this
letter in his hands
and if ghouls
dig it up again
then perhaps justice will be done when i am not here to see it
we are older now
and my fires at last are out
i know that you are
more than aware of my name
but i find you must see it
in print one last time
it has been made known to me that your husband is near to death
so i have writ down
for his eyes only some things
i find i cannot say what things
and have sealed the letter
if you wish to read it
it is in your hands
though i must hope that he
will see it first and decide
i have done great harm
though i meant none to you
ill see they get back
no questions asked
youre more enterprising
than i gave you credit for
was there a compliment
in there somewhere
hmm yes probably
what i cant believe is fergus wolfe conniving with cropper
i thought i was
a better judge of men
well see that
where you went wrong
you gave him credit
for being one
thank you
hi
hi
thank you for coming
sure
i believe
that may be her
i uh-im sorry
no im sorry
no listen i lost it totally
it wasnt you
so why dont we all
talk some strategy
let me introduce you to
uh-all right
professor blackadder paola
this is dr bailey
maud
maud
how do you do
so do we really think that cropper capable of something like this
of robbing a grave
it creepy the idea
of opening a grave
let just keep going
jesus
the moping owl does to the moon complain
complain
are you ready
yeah
hold the light up
fergus fergus
is that it
yes it gotta be
i found it fergus
i found it
oh my god
i found it fergus
great
hey cropper
cropper
this has nothing
to do with you people
wait get off of me
get off of me
no you dont
traitor
bloody conniver please
wait
what are you doin
oh shit
are you sure
we should be doing this
i told blackadder
wed just take a look
before we handed it over
to the museum
can you hold that there
maud look at this
it her handwriting
my dear my dear
they tell me
you are very ill
perhaps i am wrong
to disturb you at this time
with unseasonable memories
but i find i have after all
a thing which i must tell you
you will say it should have
been told 20 years ago
but i could or would not
you have a daughter
who is well and married
and the mother
of a beautiful boy
ive sent you a picture
you will see she resembles
both her parents
neither of whom she knows
to be her parent
when i said at that terrible séance
that you had made a murderess of me
i was speaking of poor blanche
who then torments me daily
and i thought
let him think so then
if he knows me so little
i had a secret fear you see
i was afraid that
you would wish to take her--
you and your wife--
for your own
but i could not let her go
over here
and so i hid her from you
and you from her
she loves her adoptive
parents most deeply
me she does not love
so i am punished now
living at seal court with them and watching her grow
i have been angry
for so long
with all of us
and now near the end
i think of you again
with clear love
did we not--
did you not flame
and i catch fire
was not the love
that we found
worth the tempest
that it brewed
i feel it was
i know it was
if you are able or willing
please send me a sign that you have read this
i dare not ask
if you forgive
christabel lamotte
ash had never read this
he never knew
he had a child
youre descended from both
christabel and ash
my god
all these clues
theyre for you
for us
youre so beautiful
there are things that happen
not spoken or written of
a poet walked out
one summer day
seeking forgiveness
from a love long lost
he found
something else instead
this is how it was
morning
good morning

another name i dont like

around this guy
we dont know anything

these poor bastards
i was one of these
poor bastards
this is like the village
i grew up in

she me twenty years ago
whyd you leave luz

i couldve stayed
and become a farmer wife
like my mother
and become an old woman
at thirty
or go to work in one of
the turista cities
i chose the city
is your family still there
theyre all gone
like dust
my two brothers
died of cholera
my father died of hard work
and my mother died
of broken dreams
i was the lucky one i guess
luz worked as a maid at one of
the hotels in puerto vallarta
then as a waitress at chulo
that where i met her
sad beginnings happy endings
that right
and what about you
where are your people from
brooklyn new york
but they left me
my dad ran away when he was 35
my mom fell in love
with the bottle
and sent me packing
to my grandparents in oregon
where i grew up
i’m sorry
eh fuck em
if they can’t take a kid
if we stay on 5
it pretty much straight up
all the way
danny

to rosario
it not too far from here
why do you want to go there for
i want to pay respects
to my parents
visit their graves
i’m sorry honey
that takes us out of our way
to see dead people
maybe we could pay our respects
on the trip back
we wont stop i know
no if we take this little road
out of escanaba
head west towards the sea
we go right by rosario
well that’s just
an inch on the map
but that’s about an hour by car
i’ll give you another 500 bucks
i--i don’t want
any more of your money
i thought you were in a hurry
i’m trying
to save you some time
i’m willing to give it up
i like seeing these back roads
little villages
i hope so
because you might be spending
a week or two in one of them
if my car breaks down
i’ll take that chance

come on
he doesnt need our help
that right
come on
now what the hell
was that all about
decline of the gene pool
you didnt have
to set the guy on fire
no i couldve let him
cut your balls off
rape your girlfriend
it never would’ve gone to that
you spend too much time
with your typewriter danny
in the real world some people
arent just fake dangerous
theyre real dangerous
oh yeah right
this from the guy
who has no tourist card
remember
hey you know what
around here the judiciales
the federal police
are a lot more dangerous
than a couple of biker trash
thank you luz
stop
what
stop
what is it
it an ocelot
what it doing in the cage
oh it to sell to a zoo
or some rich tourist needs
to keep her neck warm
i dont know
ask him how much
he wants for it
we cant put that thing
in my car
yeah i know
what are you asking
the price for
to let it go
he says $3000
he says they are very rare
i dont have that much left
look at it
he should kill the damn thing
or let it go
ask him how hed like to live
trapped in a little cage
he says he does
he used his real name
he either a hostage
or the dumbest accomplice
in the world
he says they paid in cash
for two rooms
if they used
two separate rooms
then it probably not
a hostage situation right sir
right
now stop talking before you ruin
west point reputation
show me
he said the man and the woman
stayed in this room
and the suspect in the other
what are we hoping to find
sir may i ask
nothing
he too smart
to leave anything behind
i just wanted to stand
in his space for a moment
breathe the air he breathed
maybe sniff out a clue
in the ether
you believe in metaphysics
weatherford
no sir
not really
me neither
he says the suspect went for--
stop with the dick tracy
his name is price
price
took a swim in the pool
hmm
sure why not
there a dragnet
over half of mexico
and he having
a fucking pool party
we have the make and the model
of the car señor
it’s just a matter of time
but how much rivera
it not just that im getting
older in this steam bath
or that price might
whack a few dozen people
before we find him--
it also embarrassing
i mean where are
all the bright lights
of the mexican police
and military
while he taking his road trip
aren’t you just
a little embarrassed
we haven’t found him yet
señor it true
but you created him
who should be more embarrassed
she said she wants to be alone
yeah i’ve said that too
i shouldve come back
to see her more
before she died
i lost so many minutes with her
i know
you wish you could go back
listen a little harder
look a little more closely
at their eyes
and speak a few more kind words
many more
if--if you could have
what would you have said to her
i wouldve
thanked her
for fighting
to give me more than she had
she argued with my father
to get me to school
and he beat her for her pride
she let him beat her
but she won
gracias mama
and look at you--
so smart so beautiful
she wouldve been proud
no
i wasn’t worth being beaten for
i’m not a good girl

so proud to be
a killer of men
to steal a human life

how to use that thing
he could hose us all down
in a second if he freaks out
thanks for helping me
appear nonchalant
and don’t try acting out
that little drama
youre playing around
in your head
cause ill be rewriting
the ending you understand

you should be more careful
mexico can be very dangerous
if you are notcareful
¿está bien
muy bien
gracias
that--that was pretty easy
yeah maybe too easy
how do you mean
nothing
what the most direct route
north from here
i think were on it
well pull off
let try to avoid
the main roads
is this heap gonna make it
if we dont drive it into
the ground i think so yeah
let find a little town where
we can rehabilitate ourselves
and hopefully the car
i’m bettin on the car
hey luz
you did good back there
i did it for us not for you
yeah well
thanks anyway
what is this
ricardo montalban birthday
these small towns
are always looking
for an excuse for a fiesta
probably remembering
some local
who saw the virgin
in a cornfield or something
excuse me mexican in the car
i’m sorry luz
never mind it true
better for us
easier to get lost
that looks like a hotel
over there
you want to check it out
yeah
you two go check in
ohand no secret messages
to the clerk
no paper airplanes for help
out the window
nothing you ever read
or wrote about
that shit only works
on paper clear
good
because
whether you know it or not
youre both better off
with me now
than you would be
with the authorities
really
now what happens to us
after we ditch you at
the border assuming we make it
hostages temporary insanity
ill think of something
let take care of this life
before we worry about the next
go on
room 7
meet me in that restaurant
across the plaza
ten minutes
were in room 8
go ahead honey
should we go to the police
in this town
some old man
and his brother-in-law
they probably
dont even have guns
by the time the real police
or the judiciales get here
we could be dead
we could get in the car
try to make a run for it
not in that car
but he right
where would we go
the judiciales
are more scary than he is
if he hadnt killed
those three today
wed both be in jail now
and i wouldve been fucked
by three men at least
what should we do
now you want my advice
you think i wouldve
agreed to drive him
if i had known
this was gonna happen
or let you come with us
i dont know
but you shouldve known danny
i’m sorry honey
dont im too angry
to take care of you
i’m too tired
to make love to you
where the fuck are we anyway
somewhere in between--
never mind
surprise me later
you ever watch any of those
vd training films
sir i think
they stopped showing those
after the korean war
damn shame too given all
the disease roaming around here
you got someone back home
no sir
you
nah
i live with
this middle-aged woman
who claims to be my wife
but
i stopped arguing with her
about it a long time ago
i just stay out of her way
i’m married to uncle sam
i’m his bitch just like you
no i dont
i dont see--
i dont quite see it
that way sir
oh ha ha you will
relationships have a way of
creeping up on you
then all of a sudden bam
youre screwed
but you’re young
what are you  2
25 sir
get out
no
old fart
you guys are all the same
iowa
rifle team
class president
4-h club
no youre close sir
oh
ohio
and uh
i couldn’t join
the 4-h club sir
because my cow died
good weatherford
you mustve spent
your junior year
abroad from the academy
growing a sense of humor
thank you sir
keep it youll need it
it might save you
from a razor blade
to the wrists one day
gracias
let me have the car keys
if you feel like leaving
dont let us stop you
oh i wouldnt leave you
stranded here
that why you followed us
to the church
in puerto vallarta--
the car
i did hear the bartender
mention it during the argument
what if danny
hadnt agreed to drive you
i couldnt risk
having him finger me
hed already proved
he had a big mouth in the bar
so what
you wouldve killed me
keep your voice down
youre completely amoral
dont throw your boy scout
code of honor in my face
i’ve been fighting battles
for you for thirty years
for me
yeah that right
while you were jerking off
in college
i was shooting people
and getting shot at
in vietnam and loas
and cambodia and panama
well thanks for killing
all those strangers for me
dont mention it you pampered
ungrateful bag of shit
how many people have you killed
300 and change
300 men
and women and kids
and they were all soldiers
so you were the good guys
that what we thought
whatd they think they were
were they the bad guys
because they werent paying you
well i guess morality
is pretty subjective
look at you
you sold yourself
your car and your girlfriend
for five grand
and youre the most
self-righteous bastard i know
-i dont kill people for money
danny
don’t tell me
the fiesta outside fellas
oh im sorry
i liked that song too
maybe you could like it
a little more quietly
yes maam
sit down
sit down danny
well finish eating
and then take a walk
we all could use one
i dont want to take a walk
i wasnt giving you a choice
would you have shot me too
no
maybe it was the way you looked
when you tripped
coming down those stairs
out of the church
you were waiting for us
outside the church
i walked over to you remember
but i mean before that
you were lying in wait for us
forget it i dont want you
freaking out again
were you or werent you
-i didnt do it did i
i cant believe this
you make me sick
hey keep walking
no
keep walking
dont let it spook you
we all brush against death
so many times in our lives
without knowing it
this was just one
you found out about
it must feel wonderful thinking
you have all this power
it’s just business to me
yeah if youd taken
better care of business
none of this wouldve happened
i mean come on
two guys in broad daylight
on a crowded street
a little sloppy
don’t you think
id been trailing
the civilian for days
first time he was exposed
who was he
i dont know
some guy who’d been selling
something to the chinese
computer technology
they don’t tell me that stuff
the us government that is
so then why are you running
i wasnt contracted
for the other hit--
the navy officer
you mean that was a mistake
i was standing
right next to him
not a technical mistake
a personal one
what do you mean
i knew the guy
i wanted to kill him
danny
i’m right here honey
where were you
restless
i got some fresh air
what are you doing up
i hear him cry out
guilt and remorse
should we go to him
what no
let him live with his ghosts
he created them
no use she done this before
the fuel pump shot
can you fix it
yeah with a new fuel pump
any chance of finding one here
no way not in this burg
i have to take
the old one out
find a replacement in a bigger
town like mazatlán maybe
how do you get there
there are buses going between
these small towns all the time
i could probably get there
and back in one day
how far are we from the border
24 hours
driving straight through
but even if we could
get this thing started

the question is when
you deserve a lot more
no
you dont know me well enough
yeah i do
you want lunch or something
something
did you ever pray
yeah during the war
when i was being tortured
i prayed id die
when i didnt i gave up on god
it a sin to pray for death
i don’t think god is
even counting my sins anymore
he is
but he forgives you
we are all sinners
i’m tired
do you mind if i rest
no not at all
luz
luz
i couldnt leave you alone
i know
there nothing wrong
with the fuel pump
danny wanted me
to meet him in mazatlán
yeah i know the 300 bus
i saw him buy the ticket
then why didn’t you--
i wanted you to stay
but only if you wanted to
the first time i was with danny
it was for money
i did work at chulo
but i didnt make enough money
to live on
or to send home
so
sometimes i went with men
those bikers
at the restaurant knew
i am a puta
they didnt know anything
except that youre beautiful
scum like that
think all women are whores
but i was
danny never throws it
in my face
never mentions it
still it always there
i think
in the back of his mind
and now yours
you had a hard time
you had to stay alive
i understand that
what will he think
when i dont show up
hell accept it
if not now then later
am i a bad girl
no no no
god forgives you
were all sinners
bad dream
yeah theyre all bad
i heard you last night
same dream over and over
since the war
lo siento tanto
some memories are too
terrible to live with
i thought they’d stop
after i killed him
killed who
that guy in puerto vallarta
the navy officer
he left me to die in cambodia
in the jungle
my spotter and i
were trapped there
he was supposed to lift us out
if things got hot
and he left us
he just flew away
dios mio
my friend my spotter
was killed right away
and then i was shot kicked
stabbed with bayonets
and that guy in the chopper--
reese--
watched it all
and didnt do a goddamn thing
what happened
i was dragged away
and tortured
the only thing
that kept me alive
was hating that fucker reese
i wanted to live
just to get him
dios castiga
i’m sure god punished him
long before you killed him
not enough
i got away escaped
floated down
some river to thailand
and after they patched me up
and i got out of the hospital
i went to work for the cia
and i never ever
forgot about reese
but i never saw him again
till that day
in puerto vallarta
the day i met you
do you believe in fate
more than that
i believe in miracles
were gonna need one
to get out of here alive
you know that don’t you
yes
if we do
will you come north with me
i have a little place
in the hills
in oregon
deep in the woods--
very quiet very beautiful
it a good place
to be alone with someone
i would like to
we will replace
your bad dream
with a good one
where are you going
i have a plan
i dont know if itll work
but it worth a try
why cant we just take
a bus to the border
no theyll be
looking for me there
here put this on
to replace the one i messed up
in puerto vallarta
i saw you looking at it
in a shop window
thank you
back soon
look at what
i’ve been reduced to
following these idiots around
like a perpetual motion machine
pretty hopeless isnt it sir
yeah
you know
it my birthday today
really sir
no not really
in a few months
but it would bolster
my self-pity
and sense of futility
if it were today
yes sir
mcgrane
it price
where the hell are you
you first
i’m following some mexican
intelligence wunderkind
around the highways and byways
of this dysentery factory
trying to find your sorry ass
now why would you want
to do that
so they dont slaughter you
better make sure they do
what would be the point of that
to eliminate a nasty
and potentially
embarrassing problem
best way to do that
is to get you home
what about reese
what about him
what the price for that
nothing it was a mistake
you know and they know
i dont make mistakes
officially it was a mistake
youre getting older
he stepped in your sights
it was a terrible--
and ironic
yeah a terrible
and ironic mistake
it more convenient
for everyone
if you classify it that way
why did my ride pull out
he panicked
not your orders
no
believe me we just want
to get you out of here now
tell me where you are
tell me where you are
i’m in a little town
called zapata
it’s just north of rosario
right got it
where should we meet
there an abandoned church
north of town
it shouldn’t take me more than
a few hours to get there
i’ll be waiting
goody
thinks he going home sir
he is
in a box
hang a u at the next curve
yes sir
i’m ready
ready for what
honey
surprised
i guess you missed the bus
i told you
i couldnt leave him alone
no you told me youd follow me
remember
adiós mivida all that
i waited three hours for you
at the bus station at mazatlán
i’m sorry
no forget im sorry
this is bigger than im sorry
and i spent the whole night
wondering if hed killed you
or taken you hostage
or raped you
guess he didnt have
to work that hard huh
danny--
what
i love him
what the spanish word
for psychiatrist
youre with this guy
this murderer
this serial killer
for one night--
weve been with him
for almost a week now
oh it a week
it a long-term relationship
i guess a girl could fall
for charles manson in a week
and it was your idea remember
my idea
yeah
that you’d fall for him
thatd you leave me stranded
that you’d fuck him
right under my nose
danny--
i guess once a whore
always a whore
i’m sorry
i’m sorry
i didnt mean that
it all right
no it not all right
forget that i said that
i just--i didnt know
what happened to you
i didnt know why you didnt--
i thought you would go back
forget be safe
can you forget luz
just like that
can you
looks like we could use
a bigger room
yankee stadium
wouldnt be big enough
this is what you’ve been after
from the beginning isnt it
it just happened
i think i found a way
out of here
there no way out of here
there are cops and the army
in concordia
and on the road in here
to zapata
we got to take that chance
she doesnt
he right
they’re just looking for me

and danny to come along
theyll believe you
they already think
im out of control
think
luz
luz stay

that what im doing
here
what are you doing
thisll make it more believable
give us ten minutes
go down to the plaza
make a scene about what i did
to you and luz

the rest of the money i owe you
you think i could take that
a deal a deal
yeah but i never got you there

to a place i found where
the jungle meets the town
-is that it

rich people have themselves
buried in the chapel
to be closer to god

of you to kill you
no please
¡colonel
the girl was with him
she was hit
in the line of fire
did you set the blaze
yes sir
the place is a huge crypt sir
it filled with bodies
appropriate for price
i thought the fire
would make it impossible
to sort out remains
to complicate matters
in case the locals
decided to investigate
i think i underestimated you
weatherford
yes sir
i think you did
what happened
well price is dead
gunfire ignited the flames
where luz
she was caught in the crossfire
no
yes
no
no
no let go of me
it too late it too late
you shot her didn’t you
you bastards
look you want to blame someone
blame price or yourself
or her
were not stupid enough
to think
either of you
was completely innocent
now consider yourself
lucky to be alive
oh my god oh god
señor
all right now
calm down calm down
before the local boys
use you as the scapegoat
youd better get out of here

yeah just watch what you say
well hear everything
shit
youre probably not allowed
to swear on your station
no we can cut most of it out
but it helps
if youre not dropping f-bombs
point noted filed right here
so if i was to call this guy
an ass-monkey
that wouid be considered
a swear too right
it gonna be a long night
so this thing
yeah
is this some sort of torture device
when you dont get in your turnouts
that what it is
can you get it
yes this is cailed a hook ladder
we use this in the--
the firemen would use this--
we should bring it down
yes
okay
all right
can you grab the hook
so this was used
in the 20s and the 30s
oh my god
yeah
and as you can see
these are the rungs
and the hook at the end
they would grasp onto one window
and then pull themselves up
and then when they got to that
windowsill they would hook it again
and then puil themseives up
okay
did you get the hook scott
you see this
used in the 20s and 30s
they stopped using it around--
hoid it up higher
replaced it--
that good right
good
replaced it
with a regular ladder that extends
yeah and rope
they must have tiny feet
those are little rungs
yeah firemen
were a iot smaller back then
the fires were bigger
and they were smaller
dont tell captain we took this down
im not gonna teil him l touched it
i wanna introduce you to somebody
this is wilshire mark
good boy
hey wilshire
say hi
dog right out of the cartoons
well there a reason
why the daimatians were in cartoons
the fire department
has a great sense of tradition
yeah we do
dalmatians
got along well with horses
important when the fire trucks
were horse-drawn
now theyre used as mascots
but what theyre trained to do
is run in and stop the traffic
kind of like fletch
yeah
that what l do i run out there
sort of like what a siren does today
okay weli wilshire can show you
what to do in case you catch on fire

dogs and cats mostly
all i can really do is l can dress
their wounds and try to comfort them
how are the injured men doing
they both lost a lot of biood
and the fireman over here
he got a bunch of broken bones
and probable internal bleeding
apparentiy mrs espinoza attacked

oh jesus
her tear ducts and saiivary glands
are constantly flowing
she seems
to be unable to swallow or speak
she has a fever she confused
she has some degree
of paralysis and delirium
these are all rabies symptoms
are you sure
im a vet
never seen it in humans
but i know what rabies look like
are you trying to tell me
these people have rabies
tears saliva fever
tears saliva fever
they have what she has
but here the thing rabies
takes months for symptoms to show
this is taking minutes
i mean rabies never acts this fast
how does rabies spread
through bites
no it passed through anything wet
blood saliva any mucous membrane
so if you get their blood on you
youre okay
but if you get their blood on you
and it gets into a cut
into your mouth eyes
then youre not okay
how it cured
no there no cure
people get shots in their stomach
before symptoms starts showing
once symptoms show
rabies is 00 percent fatal

including chemical warfare
were used to wipe them out
with great success
i guess you dont know about
the current state of affairs
after nine years of fighting
afghanistan is getting stinger missiles

except for one region
80 km behind the border

seems to be really brutal
as the photos show
he prevents
any outside help getting in
and that why wed like to
check out the problem firsthand
and what have i got to do with it
im to go there
but youre not going to
sure with you john
i put in my time
what does that mean
my war is over
but you said he was a great soldier
alright

he just obeying orders
it an important mission
and we can make a difference
that why were going
it didnt work before
those were different times
come with me john
i dont know what you think
but i like it here
i like living and working here
it good to belong somewhere
but you dont belong here
when are you coming full circle
what do you mean
you say your war is over
the war outside maybe
but not the one inside you
i know why youre here
but it doesnt work like that
youre trying to change yourself
but you stay who you are
and what am i
a full-blooded fighter
i dont want to be that any more
but that what you are
listen john
there was once a sculptor
who found a very special stone
he carried it home and worked on it
for months until it was finished
then he showed it to his friends
they said great statue
but the sculptor said
the statue had always been there
all he had done
was to knock away a few pieces
we didnt make you
into a fighting machine
we just knocked the rough edges off you
you have to finally
come to terms with yourself
until you come full circle
i guess im not ready yet
i have to go
come and see me
when youre next in the states
i promise
im sorry
but it has to end for me sometime
i understand
take cover
drop your weapons and stand still
you cant escape
drop your weapons
there no escape
drop your weapons
at once
something went wrong
what happened
the soviets intercepted the team
trautman and the others
were taken to the enemy camp
and now
i cant do anything
im sorry
i just thought you should know
you
can you get me in
youre not serious
of course i am
officially it not possible
then unofficially
you should know one thing
if you get taken prisoner
or something leaks out
well deny any knowledge of you
im used to it
youll hear from me
you want buy many guns
no im looking for mousa chanin
what your name
john rambo
r 7
they sell well here
because of the landmines
everywhere landmines
i am mousa chanin what do you want
griggs sent me
you dont look like the guys
he usually sends soldiers
im not a soldier
then what a mercenary
no
a tourist that lost his way
im not a tourist
sorry
do you know where the american is
in a soviet fort
near khost 30 miles from the border
mr griggs sent
the supplies you wanted
do you want to see
yes
did you order these
yes
ive never seen anything like it before
what are these
detonators
and this
a blue light
what does it do
turns blue
i see
how many men will come with us
im the rescue team
that crazy one isnt enough
we need more people
griggs said youd take me there
so do it
i have to take medicine with me;
if not many people will die
do you understand
i dont know you
but from the way you look
you have no experience of war
or do you
ive fired a gun before
fired a gun before
maybe you should go home again
and think things over
very long
ive done that
oh really
ok if that what you want
but you cant get
that american out alone
if it doesnt work dont blame me
im not taking the responsibility
sounds familiar
i am colonel zaysen
regional commander of this sector
youre the first american
to be captured in afghanistan
congratulations
i believe you plan
to supply the enemy rebels
with stinger missiles
to destroy soviet aircraft
ill only answer to your superiors
out here i have no superiors
i am in full command
youre on your own
abandoned by your government
what do you want
cooperation
this sector has been controlled by us
for five years
there not much left for me to do
there is so to speak
no challenge any more
if you give me information
about the planned stinger deliveries
we could both get out of here
after all that is what we all want
peace
in the kremlin
they really have a sense of humor
explain
to the world you talk about peace
and here you butcher a whole people
were not butchering anyone
youre too intelligent
to believe that propaganda
again where are the missiles
i dont know anything about missiles
of course
but you dont understand
that i can get us out of here
do you want sympathy
after all you started this war
it just a question of time
until we have total victory
there wont be any victory
youre losing ground every day
to badly equipped freedom-fighters
you simply underestimated
the competition
didnt you take history at school
this region was always independent
they prefer to die rather than
become slaves to occupying forces
you cant conquer a people like that
we tried it
we had our vietnam
now youve got yours
oh i see
you want to test me
good
this is afghanistan
alexander the great
tried to conquer it
then ghenghis khan
the english and now the russians
but the afghan people
cant be conquered
an old enemy wrote a prayer about us
do you want to hear it
very well it goes like this
“may god deliver us
from the cobra venom
from the tiger teeth
and the afghan vengeance“
do you understand that
that you dont take any shit
something like this
go on
in the north there are lots of caves
that we can use
itll be safer let go
this cave leads
to the “valley of the five lions
the afghan king was supposed
to send 500 warriors into battle
he only sent five
the five best and they won
he said
better five lions than 500 sheep
what dyou think of that
the king was lucky
how much longer till the village
about two hours
where in my sector
are the missiles being delivered
i dont know
youre lying
ok ill tell you
i knew you were lying
so where are the missiles
real close
how close
in your ass
youve tested
my patience long enough
up till now
ive behaved in a civilized way
the name john rambo
have you heard it before
he says a rescue attempt
is being planned with rebel help
he says he knows
where this man is heading
we will welcome him
it the last village in the valley
00 people live here
lots of kids
yes they are good fighters too
ill tell the leaders
we want to talk to them
theyve never seen
a man like you here before
theyre mujahedin horsemen
at the border there are 0000 more
they are waiting there for weapons
then theyll come and fight here
let go to the hospital
he is the only doctor
for 500 km
the first medication
for two months
more gifts from the soviets mines
they look like toys
some children learn too late
that theyre not
that uri he russian
a deserter
a defector
there are lots of them
he can help us best;
he knows the inside of the fort
wed better leave now
this is where the mines start
one meter here then two meters there
then round here
there are four watchtowers
with four guards
here here here and here
where are the prisoners
here
once were in
is there another way out
underground
where the dirty water is
i dont know the right word
he means the sewer
where is it
here it comes out here
there are guards patrolling
better not to go that way
then well go through the minefield
that impossible
it full of spetnaz commandos
were just a few
weve lost many men already
well lose more that way
i dont need many men
what your plan
two men for the minefield
two for the rescue
the soviets will come back again
and more people will die
i cant wait
you have to wait for help like us
then ill go alone
you will die
then ill die
wait
please dont go
my name is masoud
let me explain
why we cant help you
most afghans are very strong
and we dont want to be
driven out of our country
our children are dying
of disease mines poison gas
our women are being raped and killed
last year in the legman valley
the next valley
6000 afghans were killed
pregnant women were bayoneted
and their babies thrown in the fire
they do that so that there can be
no new generation of afghans
but nobody sees it and
the papers dont report it
the men you see here
are mujahedin
holy warriors
this war is a holy war for us
for a mujahedin there is no death
because we have already
made our peace with god
and consider ourselves dead
for us dying for our country
and for god is an honor
that my friend is why
we must stop the murder of our families
if we succeed in freeing the man
and he tells the free world
that our war here is necessary
then of course we will help
let us now discuss amongst ourselves
how we can best free the man
thank you
we thank you
dont worry
theyll soon make a decision
we have to leave this evening
what your name
this boy is very hard inside
his parents were killed last year
his brother died in the fort
where the american is
he looks like a boy
but he fights like a man
what your name
rambo
where do you come from
arizona
arizona how many days walk from here
two years
two years

me too
what a child he always like that
look our national sport
an old insane game
maybe 3000 years old
they play non-stop
war or not it doesnt matter
do you like it
i prefer football
what is football
do you play it with your feet
not really
let
what are they saying
they want you to try it
it a way of welcoming you
try it if you want
but im not taking the responsibility
ill try it
yes
how does it go
the sheep has to be carried round once
and then thrown in the circle
why
because there is a circle there
and that all
very simple
like football
god must love crazy people
why
he made so many of them
that how it is here
in every war there supposed
to be a kind of honor
where is the honor here where

﻿
when the territories of
the great west were thrown open
men of all kinds rushed in
most came to settle peaceably
lured by free land
gold cattle
a man could begin a herd
with a maverick
an unbranded stray on the public range
by putting his brand on it
he owned it
cattle barons had started
their great herds with mavericks
now they fought each settler
who tried to do the same
they fought to keep the settlers
off the public lands
drive them from their homes
destroy their towns
vast ranges became the
battlegrounds of cattle wars
when the wyoming big ranchers
found guns were not enough
they used the maverick law
a law through which they appointed
themselves commissioners
with power to rule on the ownership
of every maverick branded
a commissioner ruling could
declare the settler a rustler
outlaw his brand
make his mavericks illegal to sell
of course there was no shortage
of sharp-witted men
who were quick
to take advantage of this law
i know what im entitled to
im willing to fight for my rights
and im willing to fight for your rights
but youve got to stand behind me
youve got to put me
in the governor mansion
youve got to have someone to
represent you not just reece duncan
go ahead mr averell
dont let me stop you
what brings you to town
your ears burning
what is this maverick law
the maverick law was designed to
protect us all against cattle rustling
there is nothing in that law
that says new settlers
cant pick up unbranded cattle
and call them their own
when a cattle commission was appointed
to watch over brands and cattle
that was for our protection too
id like to ask mr duncan one question
id like to ask him
who paid bribe money
to the cattle commissioners
to outlaw your brands
to see to it that every time you roped
a maverick it was confiscated
just hold it still everybody
real quiet and still
put the gun away
i only aimed to drill his hat sheriff
just let out some hot air
keep it there
i think mr duncan would like
a crack at the governorship himself
do you reckon wyoming
will ever have a governor
wholl take a shot at a man
who doesnt wear a gun
no or anyone who carries it
under cover either
this is a big deal sheriff you ought to step out of it
everybody oughta
im warning you men this range is taken
there no room for squatters
you started from scratch yourself duncan
that was a long time past
for you but were just beginnin
and we aim to start with mavericks
and we aim to stay
youll stay just so long
as you stay within the law
which means that if i find any one of you
rounding up and branding cattle on my range
i have the right
to fill you full of lead
easy boys easy
a couple of you boys
have asked me if i had any ideas
well gentlemen
here one of my
biggest ideas right now
hello kate how are you
same as always jim
measurements and memory
keep the measurements forget
the memory im gonna make it up to you
folks the newest and latest
scintillating gem to greet our fair town
is there anyone here so young who doesnt
recognize the name of kate maxwell
hello boys
pleased to meet you
boys i never was any good at keeping
secrets from you but i sure kept this one
that place of mine
ive been fixing up
well it belongs to kate
from here on in
therell be music high-kick dancing
and the straightest card game in wyoming
and youll have money for it too
kate a cattle buyer now
she aims to buy up every maverick
you can lay a rope on so bring em on in
kate got her own brand
and not an outlaw brand
shell market your mavericks for you
and there nothing
that duncan and his
cattlemen association can do about it
what are you up to this time jim
i told you i was gonna make you rich
i dont suppose ive got to ask
my lawyer if this is legal
it legal mr duncan
ive looked into it
miss maxwell youve looked into it too
it liable to get you in some hot water
why i soak in hot water
every day mister
it good for the complexion
im glad youre used to it
just in case any of those mavericks
you take in trade come from my range
im just warning you
no animal on my property
branded or not is a stray
whatever you pick up
on the open range is yours
anything you take from me
has lead coming after it
suppose you and me
have a little talk mr averell
waitll you find out
what this is all about
all right boys take the coach
and the wagon over to kate place
boys make room for the lady
oh kate this is stan blaine
sweetwater strong arm of the law
pleased to meet you sheriff
why dont you show me the town
some night before you show me the jail
you talk like you dress
but you dont feel that way
play along with him
play
he just a drifter doesnt make
any trouble doesnt want any
the job was open so he took it
drifter
now i am a man with a purpose
thank you
mind if i give you a hand miss
why id be pleasured
ill carry you
this one a lady
why thanks
take a look kate it all yours
not bad in fact pretty good
so why are you giving it away
well honey ive got a sense of obligation
i owe you something
oh the world must be coming to an end
not only is jim averell
giving things away
but he paying his debts
listen kate a lot of things
have changed since i last saw you
since i last saw you
running out of abilene like a jackrabbit
leaving me holding the sack
did anybody get rough with you
why will you go back there
and gun them down
sorry jim there no money in it
just a poor underpaid judge
i guess somebody oughta give me
a necktie party for what ive done to you
maybe somebody will
but you came when i called you
you didnt waste any time
birds of a feather
but that doesnt mean ill ever feel
the same way about you
you will honey you will
believe me that last sour deal
is way behind me
im going up up and up right into
the governor mansion
to ask a pardon
to be the governor
im going to make the whole territory
of wyoming my own private range
think i cant do it these settlers
would vote me into the white house
im the only one around here
wholl promise them anything
and what in your way
reece duncan
i got a big front but he is big
sounds crazy but it true if duncan goes
i can be governor of wyoming
you will of course
drop in sometime for a drink
and youll be with me
that what im trying to tell you kate
im going to make up to you
for everything
what this other thing about
why am i a cattle buyer
you dont have to know anything
about cattle dont let that scare you
i know plenty
i was riding a cow pony before i could walk
what the deal
duncan again but you dont have to know the details
you just buy mavericks and sell em
look
here your brand registered and legal
kate maxwell
k-bar-m
honey it wont be long before people
are calling you cattle kate
these three for you tex
good let go
whatll it be tex chips or cash
chips watch me double em
that duncan brand wally
let it go
here a maverick for you wally
it a clean one
for value received one maverick
whatll it be
chips
horses comin matt
it duncan ill head him off
what the matter with you that a rustler
matt jessup
im missing branded steers
the jessup boys are taking mavericks
these werent mavericks
they carried the bar-double-check
i dont say you didnt lose em
thereve been reports of strange faces
sheriff there gonna be
a range war here
i suggest you make up
your mind whose side youre on
i have im on the side
of the first man who gets killed
i could knock him off right now
why wait naw
save us weeks of work and put that
loud-talking duncan where averell wants him
i said no
why not
cause averell said
to let him burn a while
i told him to come after midnight
after midnight he better
he does what you say this afternoon
he couldve finished duncan off easy
but he let him go because
that what you wanted
i dont get it boss
abilene taught me something
to wait
we set one side against the other
prod em a little;
first duncan then the settlers
and wait till they kill each other off
that the way to get
things done for you
in fact that the way
into the governor chair
how will that help you
to become governor
look when times are rough a man can
make himself a reputation overnight
thatll spread through
the whole territory like wildfire
that if he on the popular side
and right now ive got these settlers
eating out of my hand
the way you got it figured
there wont be any settlers left
now thatd be too bad
in that case id have to take
the consolation prize
and all the cattle and
all the land in this valley
i might become one of the richest most
important men in the territory of wyoming
there more than one way
to become governor
does kate know how youre running the cattle set-up
no
and nobodyll know if you and the boys
keep your mouths shut and do as i tell ya
understand
yeah boss
if i dont stand on 9
my mind aint on the cards
friend of yours kate
take over ive got to talk to a customer
go ahead
with jim i can at least
keep my eyes on the cards
good evening sheriff drifting
mmm got a nice clean shave there
i bet it was for me
youre keeping the boys busy
roping by day and gambling at night
this is a free country
they work hard for their money
and they got a right to spend it
the way they want to
none of my business
just wonderin where some of em
find time to do any rustling
duncan on the warpath
somebody taking his branded stock
oh he just talkin
he got to say that to stir up trouble
no there rustling going on
got it from the other ranchers
the cows i buy are clean
unbranded mavericks
you ever see a range war
there isnt going to be a range war here
a few rustled cattle--
a few rustled cattle started
the bloodiest killings in texas
i was there
oh so that where you hail from texas
mm-hmm

passin through
oh drifting

a man knows where he going
take a look at jim averell

no
every one of those cows
were taken off the free range
you dont have to spit fire at me
my word good enough for everybody
else it ought to be good enough for you
it is
then dont come with rumours of rustling and range wars
im a businesswoman giving the homesteaders
their first look at cash in two years
i dont want trouble
there trouble in the range youll be in it along with us
not if im playing straight
and minding my own business
my pa minded his own business
we had a small spread
down near houston
when the trouble came
he said hed stay out of it
the range war you were talking about
i was up in the barn
when the shootin started
by the time i got down and ran for my rifle
pa was hanging on the corral fence
ma was dead lying in the front yard
they killed my three brothers
who killed them
folks neighbours
people who just got so mad
they started killin
how old were you then
thirteen
thirteen your whole family
is that when you started drifting
drifting not so bad
a man sees a lot of country

about getting married

for good
leave him alone
ever since that abilene business
every time you get called out of a room
i get an urge to follow you
now what this about
nothing honey
this drifter was interfering
in something private
as a drifter or as the sheriff
and what jail did you boys break out of
do we take him or not
you leave him alone
that what youll do
and i hope youre thinking up a good story
jim because im getting awfully mad
dont
youll only come apologizing later
he nobody to be skittish about
dump him where hell have
a long walk back
how do i know they wont kill him
i wouldnt trust them
as far as i could throw a steer
they do exactly as i tell them
get to it men
you like him
no there no money
in that kind of maverick
all right who are those men
it seems they were running
some cattle into your corral
whose cattle
yours
anyway your brand
there werent that many here
a few minutes ago
that what im trying to tell you kate
look at this
here reece duncan brand
bar-double-check
now watch this is clever
k-bar-m
katie somebody apt
to call you a cattle rustler
why you dirty low-down-
it takes money to run for office
youll never be governor
youll be crow bait on the end of a rope
im no rustler but you are
this is your brand
registered in your name
i dont share the business with you
i gave it to you
youre the one who been buying and selling
cattle how do you get out of that
wait till i tell stan about this
and duncan
what if they dont believe you
pretty big risk isnt it
jim what are you up to
this isnt a big enough
operation for you
ive told you were going to
the governor mansion
it going to take time
and a lot of money
and meanwhile
youll keep your pretty mouth shut
when im playing for high stakes
i get awfully upset if anyone talks
hi sheriff
maybe you can teach
knuckles how to ride i give up
come on you stumblebum
where kate
went riding
come on knuckles youre not going
to throw in the towel are you
ill get a decision over you yet
hold on tight knuckles
come on ya bum
hi everybody
you look like you came off second best
third
bet you brought him in though whoever he was
no he still kinda loose
but you will
i aim to
you had a lot of stock in here last night some
how many head when we looked at them
why
how many head this morning
before you got them out in such a hurry
putting together that question
and that tin badge
it looks like im accused
of being a rustler
two minutes after you left last night
some cattle came headin for the corral
driven by my boys of course
too dark to see that
but you did see them put cattle into my corral
no i got busy
so youve taken such a personal dislike to me
that without seeing anything
without any proof
youre willing to believe that im a rustler
i havent taken a dislike to ya
sheriff i go by actions
not by words
and what i feel when you talk to me-
why i just feel as homely as a mud fence
homely youre the most-
women
what did he say
i gave him a line he wont be any trouble
that why he has that job
that why i gave it to him
i took one look at him when he first
came into town and i said to myself
that the kind of sheriff
i need a drifter
ive got to hand it to you
this time youre playing it smart jim
it nice to hear you say so
except i know youd like
to see me break my neck
that would be nice
oh katie youre just ungrateful
makes me very unhappy
i dont like the way you operate
you dont think of anyone but yourself
what about the homesteaders
in this thing
how long will it be before duncan
starts taking it out on them
what makes you think hed do a thing like that
youre hoping he will
why kate
you want trouble you want a range war
you want so much killing that theyd
have to send troops in to keep the peace
what an imagination
duncan killed arrested
or any way out of the running
and the homesteaders just about wiped
out and ready to listen to anybody
and who steps up to lead them
jim averell the poor man hope
it a good phrase
i dont want any part of this
im getting out of here
you cant kate
how far could you get
it wont take duncan long
to trace his cattle to your corral
and the sheriff to wire ahead
they dont just arrest you
for cattle rustling
jim
this act youre putting on about
not being interested in the sheriff
now youre imagining things
i hope so
im jealous honey
cant get angry with me for that
sure i want to be up there where
i know i belong but i want you with me
im doing all of this for you katie
ill prove that to you yet
but these things need time
yes that what we need time
get some of the boys
and fix that north line fence
we gotta keep the herds closer in
jiminy look what coming
good morning mr duncan
what brings you out in broad daylight
i wouldnt mind sitting
in the shade for a while
id like to be polite but
i have a lot of work to do
my business wont take long
not much here to interest a woman
it a man place
oh that would interest a woman
well it hasnt
no wife no womenfolk
id have thought otherwise
i live alone
maybe that why youre so successful
everything goes into one big ambition
so far
miss maxwell you said you had
something to talk to me about
i have you
i think youre making a big mistake
no it your settler friends who are making
the mistake with your encouragement
oh now mr duncan youre a fair man
why dont you admit you started the
whole trouble by blacklisting their brands
if you came here thinking that by
being sweet to me and nice to look at
i would become a more reasonable man-
you are a reasonable man
youve just never been
approached in the right way
miss maxwell
i came to this territory as a boy
a ragged trail hand
without a penny in my pocket
and my boots open at the toes
in 0 years i owned or controlled most of this
valley if you think im going to sit back now-
dont holler at me mr duncan
if i made the mistake of thinking that
you knew how to play for big stakes
i apologize
i was wrong
what do you mean
i said i was wrong
i thought you wanted to control
more than just this valley
why dont you read the cards
mr duncan
before long the settlers
will outnumber the cattlemen
it has to be that way
there nothing that can stop it
cooperate give them a chance
to earn an honest living
and youll be the most popular man
in the whole territory
theyll put you in
the governor mansion
not jim averell
what happened miss maxwell
you have an argument with him
let just say that i want
to be on the winning side
suppose this turns out
to be the winning side
what in it for you
the winning side will be the one i tell
the settlers to throw their weight to
and i think ill let you
fix the reward
you sound like
a natural-born politician
it all in knowing how to deal
mr duncan
mr duncan
we caught the jessup brothers
running off with some of our stock
we got em holed up the other side
of town in pitchfork canyon
you expect me to throw in
with a bunch of outlaws
ill give you an example
of how a man gets rich
see that section there
if i buy that up ill control six others
around it because of the water on it
it all in knowing how
you hear shooting
yeah it over near duncan place
let go
im out of shells matt
looks like were gonna lose this one
blast em outta there
hold your fire
better get down you dont want
one of your own friends to shoot you
drop it
i said drop it
youd better learn to take orders
once in a while mr duncan
now start moving
stop firin men
i keep underratin you miss maxwell
ive got to stop that
hal matt
come out reaching
looks interesting
keep me covered
what the story
they was rustling our cattle
a lie we found mavericks
theyre not mavericks when theyre on my land
we didnt set foot on your land
he was comin from that way
were those mavericks part of
duncan stock or werent they
where your proof
i dont need proof
them jaspers were comin from our herd
and i know rustling when i see it
all you know is gunfighting but if that
what you want you can have it now
but youll have a dead boss
simmer down wade
what do you want miss maxwell
have you still got your horses
all right get on em and hightail it
dont move anyone
what this all about
why it mr averell
glad to see you mr averell
miss maxwell and i were talking
about you just a while ago
that nice what did you say
miss maxwell did most of the talkin;
but i can see she didnt mean a word
saying she might tell the settlers
to throw in with me against you
you birds stick together all the way
ill send this back to him
you wont want to be seeing him again
evenin boys myra
were short-handed
what am i a marriage bureau
every time i get a dancer trained
i lose her
youre sure going to lose this one
you know what youre doing myra
i want to see a preacher in this hal
or im gonna get after you with a44
were gettin married as soon as
i get more maverick money
see that you hide it from him
when he celebrates
been here long
settin
can i set with you
set
what do you think
nice team
is there going to be trouble hereabouts
mm-hmm
killing
cant tell
there something queer going on
got another report of
strange faces in the hills
got another complaint from
duncan about losing cows
whatd you see him about today
i was trying to make peace
how
i wanted him to look at this whole thing sensibly
he thinks he being sensible right now
i thought maybe a woman approach-
a woman approach
a gun in the back
so you know the whole story
i know you didnt do peace any good today
what did you expect me to do let him
shoot down the jessup boys or hang them
listen jim averell brought you
out here and set you up in business
everything you do is tied in with him duncan hates averell
no youve-
when you held that gun in his back
it was being held by jim averell
who lying to the settlers
cattlemen and
for all i know lying to you
that what i want to talk to you about
those men are building for a fight
and it wont take but one wrong move
to touch it off set the range on fire
will you listen to me
im not jim averell woman
i choose my own man whoever he is
or whatever he is kingpin or drifter
it a little early to tell anything yet
he a bit low
any news
we lost him in the dark
spent the whole night combing the hills
it a waste of time
i know where to go for the bushwhacker
duncan or one of his boys shot my brother
now it my turn
and then it duncan turn
and whose turn after that
it the way feuds get started
and there no telling where it will end
i believe in law and order myself sheriff
but there also a thing called justice
and im dealing some out
the law didnt appoint you to do that
matt dont make me put you in jail
stan youre holding with duncan
the boys aint gonna like it
you just sit down and cool off
dont try to jump a gun it never works
matt can always get another gun and
duncan always gives us another reason
there a war ahead sheriff
you figure to stop it all by yourself
not if some folks want it
i say wipe out duncan and his whole outfit
it the only thing that makes sense
you talk too much
it seems to me that all men
want to do is fight
even when they talk about peace
like you
it with a gun in their hands
it high time women took a hand
in running this world
duncan and his men run
the cattle association
the homesteaders are mad
because he keeps them out in the cold
very well
let form an association of our own
sure
our own outfit to do business for us
that for being the brainiest woman
ive ever met
boys kate just had a great idea
it the answer to everything well form
our own stockmen corporation
well register our brands with it
find buyers wholl deal with us
if the courts try to stop us well have
an organization to fight back with
jim please youre not a cattle raiser
this has nothing to do with you
of course this will all take money
and itll need leadership
im going to advance you the money
i want all you people
in this territory to know
that jim averell is with you
all the way
get the boys together
better pick your side sheriff
smartest girl i ever knew
you make good partners
you and averell
what one thinks of
is good for the other
i didnt want him to be part of this
he took it out of my hands
played right into duncan
this is what we needed for a long time
kramer you and tiny peterson
start bringing em in from the north range
oconners stubbs
handle the west range
andrews elliot lamont-
hey matt you wouldnt want the men
to ride out in the sun
without something to line their throats
would you
where averell
i dont know he left ahead of us
kinda slow for a man
so anxious to help
all right men
we got plenty of work ahead
got it
couldnt you wait
sure
but not the boys
they like to be paid as they go along
it seems to me you go to an awful lot
of trouble just to start a shootin war
we could do the same thing by nightfall
by riding out and throwing a little lead
mm-hmm that why it a good idea
for you to do exactly as i say
no more no less
good coffee
makes the best coffee in the whole dang world
learned it from kate
there someone who can cook
tell him some more
i need all the recommendations i can get
here comes averell with the tally book
where have you been
weve been waiting for the tally book
the horse threw his shoe
we had to stop at the blacksmith
what the matter sheriff
dont you believe me
just looking at the white stuff
what about it
you come by way of salt lick canyon
long way around wasnt it
i said what about it
nothing about it relax
here comes the first bunch
duncan showed up yet
hell be here
sandy you just standin around
i need an extra man to look for strays
i work for jim averell
youll work in this camp
or you dont eat
there no grub to spare for gunslingers
ill help you matt
i said a man to look for strays
oh i was cuttin cattle
long before i cut cards
get me a horse something alive
tom
thank you
i wouldnt get on that critter kate
it aint safe
kate
bet shed be real handy on a homestead
round-up could be finished before duncan shows up
not likely
trouble is i hold with the settlers
instead of him
makes it pretty hard being sheriff
itll get harder all the time
duncan not the kind who gives up
maybe i am
i didnt figure on this kind of thing
when i took this job
i didnt figure on being duncan man
running around arresting homesteaders
seems to me the best thing i can do
is turn in my badge and move on
where would you go
yonder
yonder always yonder
that no life for a man
havent you ever thought about
sending down roots
staying in one place for a while
reckon so
when i find what i want
what do you want
when duncan hears how many
mavericks we rounded up
he gonna get a real bellyache
bar-vranch one calf
duncan comin up loma pass
get your girls into that tent
and get in with em stay under cover
but i want to be out here
get into the tent
off your horses boys and into place
you know what to do
get every horse outta camp
if there any trouble
theyll only be in the way
step lively everybody
he on the other side of the hill
wade hold the men up here
i dont know how far you thought
youd go with this fool idea averell
but it comes to an end right now
where that sheriff
here a complaint
signed by judge crawford
to the effect that these men
are defying the maverick law
serve it
seems all regular and in order
well sheriff i just happen to have
a federal injunction
enjoining these men from interfering
with this round-up
in any manner shape or form
will you serve it please
looks like a stand-off
that jim averell
did anybody ever outsmart him
if duncan doesnt win by brains
hell win another way
here it comes keep back
that a pretty clever trick
mr averell
im surprised at myself
not figurinon that
ive had it in my pocket
for a couple of days
just waiting for you to show up
cancelling out my court order doesnt
cancel out my rights as a rancher
you dont know of any way
to stop me from stayin here
and keeping an eye peeled for my own stock
i wouldnt wanna stop ya
get a little nervous though
lookin at all that artillery
that why we brought it here
you wont need it here
pick em up
duncan tell your boys
to drop their guns off over in kate wagon
ive got an idea they wouldnt do that
im tellin ya they will
never had so many deputies before
look over there
ive got more but you cant see em
gentlemen peace is declared
what about them
all right everybody over at kate wagon
and drop off your hardware
you deputies too
all right men
drop your guns in the wagon
hey duncan
cut out a bunch of your cows a while ago
you want the calves branded
ill take that as a favour
where its mother
got separated somehow
how do you know this one doesnt belong to me
we dont
half for you and half for us
can you think of anything better
that fair enough
acts just like you when you wont listen to reason
oh
if youd settle down
and talk things over
you might find there room enough here for all of us
could be
youre the prettiest little maverick
i ever did see
how bout lettin me
put my brand on ya
thanks im wearing one already
you gotta get used to sudden changes
hey
get outta here
stop it stop it
what the idea
stampede stampede
mount up and head em off
whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa
whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa
duncan
get your men together and clear out
weve had enough trouble here
nobody talks to me like that
that a federal court order
talking to you like that
you better go
call the men in
tell them ive gone back to the ranch
can you finish this round-up in one more day
there a chance
well then get movin
well there the last one
round-up over
how the round-up
it over your men standing by
yeah when do we move
averell will give us the word
hi maverick
how goes it with law and order
not much change
there never is any change with you
dont you ever sing or dance
or feel like kickin up your heels
come on dance with me
i wish i knew what to think about you
if i ride off itll be too late
still talking about going away
about ready to turn in
my badge and saddle up
what holding you back
nothin i reckon
i hope it turns out
to be as green as you think-
the grass on the other side of the fence
hold still everybody
just stay like that and
there wont be any trouble
im takin you to
the marshal at rawlins
what for
for rustling cattle
and murdering my foreman wade burrows
that ridiculous
what are you trying to start here
keep out of this averell
im in this all the way
and you better have plenty of evidence
there enough evidence
to hang her six times over
come out to the corral
found him out on the range
near my north section
stretched out near a brandinfire
with two holes in his back
they never gave him a chance
wade burrows was a troublemaker
it just caught up with him
what the connection with kate
ill show you right now
every time i complained to you
about losin branded cattle
youd talk about strange faces in the hills
and rustlers nobody ever sees
ill show ya some rustlers
that my brand the bar-double-check
when we picked up wade
there was a brandiniron under him
i reckon the killers forgot that
here the iron
and here what it does
kbar-m
im takin you in on suspicion
of rustlin and murder
the sheriff office is still filled duncan
dont try to do my job
this woman is goin to jail
but ill do the takin
i trust you duncan but you got
a vigilante look in your eye
hed put a rope around her neck
as soon as they got out of sight
dont worry honey
ill get you the best
legal representation in
the territory of wyoming
by the time these charges are heard
mr duncanll have to eat a lot of words
am i right boys
you bet
your deputies must be tired
after the round-up
so i know youll be glad
if i post some of my men at the jail
to see she doesnt get away
therell be more in jail when i found out
which of ya have been takin orders from her
you havent said a word
for the last 5 minutes
you used to find it easy to talk
why not now
talking to you never helped me before
what the truth kate
is averell playin you
or are you both playin me
things were bad enough in this town
before you came theyre twice as bad now
you think im a murderer and a rustler
i dont know what to think
what between you and averell
too much
keep your eyes peeled for trouble
want these gents barbecued
or slow-fried
dont get the idea
youre deputies boys
anything happens to her
youll pay for it
you might as well catch 40 winks
tomorrow could be a big day
ill stay here
you cant help her she locked up
ill stay here
kinda wondered why he wasnt around
i wouldnt put it past reece duncan
to kill one of his own men
and pin it on us
what his second move will be
i can only guess
l-im too busy thinking about kate
sitting over in that jail
seems to me we got nothing to go
on but her own word that she innocent
we brought in 300 unbranded mavericks
how did it work
fine she was so surprised
she couldnt say a word
go back and tell em to get set
youll see the signal as soon
as it light enough to see smoke
there isnt much hay over there
youd better drag over another bale
go on
i say kate had nothin to do with it
she innocent as a newborn babe
all right if nobodyll back me up
to bust her outta that jail
ill do it myself
i dont think youll have time
boys i just got some pretty bad news
sandy tells me duncan calling in
every man he got
he getting set for a fight
and hell find a good reason to start one
im going out there
and try and talk him out of it
i never heard of duncan bein talked out of anything
maybe so
at least itll give you men a chance
to get organized for a battle
see that nothin happens to her
as miserable a collection of faces
as ever i seen off a reward poster
what kind of records did you gents have
before you went to work for duncan
smart aleck dont pay him no heed
all right men come and get it
that real cordial but kinda sudden
see who outside
how do you like that
they got suspicions
ive got a good mind
to spill this stuff on the floor
quiet outside but im kinda dry inside
gimme some of that
just a minute
i kinda changed my mind about you fellas
gimme some of that beer sonny
sonny
im gonna like this
nice work knuckles pick him up
you got me covered
hey aint this somethin ajailbreak
were bustin ya outta here
who organized it
we did the sheriff outta town
jim ridin up to duncan ranch
jim found out duncan gettin ready
for a fight he gonna try and stop him
dont you believe it
in ya go
he doesnt want to stop a war
he wants to start one
boys i think it about time
you knew the truth
ive been covering up
for jim averell in one of
the slickest rustling schemes
wyoming ever saw
and the idea back of the whole thing
is to start you
and the big cattle raisers
to killing each other off
i told you she mightnt be innocent
you didnt finish
were still listenin
jim got a bunch of gunslingers
up in the hills
and one of them or sandy killed wade
burrows to pin the whole thing on me
and start this big range war
that he wants
he sure did pin it on ya how many times
that brandin iron been used
i dont know but the important thing is
he wants to start a range war
boys i know jim averell and you dont
he wants to be governor
he doesnt care how many people he
walks over to get to the governor chair
or how many he kills to stay there
i dont believe anything she says
good or bad
shut up
boys youve got to believe me
he got this whole thing worked out
what he doing at duncan
duncan as big a sucker as any of us
jim made him want to fight
and he gone up there to push him into it
i wish somebody would get over
to that case of rifles
and start protecting me
from what coming
what do you want
ill talk to you inside
if you came here to talk for kate maxwell
youre wastin your time
kate doesnt need anybody
to talk for her
she probably out of jail by now
i dont think so
i left five of my men there
hope theyre alive
duncan the settlers are talking fight
theyre gonna end this
by wiping you out
wantin to wont make it easy
id hate to be around
when she sends them out here
theyll smoke you and your men out
and knock you over like rabbits
maybe unless i crack down on them first
with a few ideas of my own
ned
call the men in
right
i suppose your story pretty straight
mr averell
now id like to know how straight you are
use your head
why are we fighting each other
neither of us really have
anything in common with these settlers
we live in a different world
we live a different life
when the chips are down
whose side do you think ill be on
theirs or ours
youre a real high-minded citizen
to be looking for the governorship
im for jim averell
i see that
so after all your big talk youre double-crossin em
that not a nice word
how do i know youre not
double-crossin me
you dont it a big chance isnt it
which reminds me
while were here talking
were giving them more time to get organized
that time about up
they want a fight
ill bring it to them
youre comin along mr averell
if anything goes wrong
ill have you right under my guns
ned get all the hands in from the range
saddle up were ridin
all set
all right come on
get on the horses boys let go
if you try to stop me now sheriff-
im not gonna stop ya
im gonna join ya like averell done
how have you managed to keep
your outlaw friends under cover so long
what outlaws
wanna tell him
i dont know what youre talking about
the outlaws working for him
the ones that killed your foreman and stole your cattle
that a lie
if it isnt averell-
no use arguing now
well find out
if there going to be a fight with duncan men
we know were going into it with clean hands
but let keep it clean all the way
the first shot must come from him
and if it does well
you boys know how to fight back
here they come
now remember
duncan boys must be
the first to start
duncan youve got about a minute
to make up your mind
throw in with the settlers
and i think we can prove our friend here
has been double-crossing
every one of us
start battlin and the outlaws
will wipe out the town
seems to me a man of your position
with all you have at stake
isnt going to let your thinking be done
for you by a $50-a-month sheriff
a saddle bum who rode
in here from nowhere
what your play sheriff
you didnt spend much time in jail
couldnt afford it too many chores
glad everybody in good humour
what it going to be stan
were gonna have a party
a mite different from
the one mr averell planned on
but he gonna be the host
get off
what for
the man spoke to ya
some odd characters in the hills are waiting
for him to tell them were killing each other
all right tell them
i dont know what you mean
the smoke signal mr averell
youre supposed to light that stack of hay as
soon as we start throwin lead at each other
then they come riding in
to take over the town
light it
the windll sweep the fire into every building in town
hal get over in the hotel
and keep a bead on him
if he tries to move anywhere
let him have it
right
now light it
light it jim
let draw em in close boys
let em think were in a free-for-all and make it good
-
what are we waitin for
all right come on
rise and shine governor
listen to that battle
this is where we split up
let ride
i left five men guardin you
nobody hurt them
their pride maybe but that all
you think im crooked and no-account
youd put more trust in a lead dollar
who killed wade burrows
do you think if i had anything to do with that
id have left that branding iron under him
like a signed confession
now youre saying that
averell tried to frame you
why should he youre working together
if i talk from now till christmas
youd still only believe what you want
all right go ahead
believe what you want
but make up your mind quickly there a fight comin on
you aint playin fair jim
you left us no chance for fun
theyre partners all right
i kept trying not to believe it
well
ive been with ya
since we rode into town
you-you boys better put up your guns
why
well i uh-l-
well look here
captured ourselves a sheriff
you boys had a nice little scheme
dont talk dont shoot it a trap
not the kind of scheme thatd give
anybody a chance but im givin you one
a fair trial if you drop your guns
were covered
that it boys
there a bead on every one of ya
let go
get that guy in the hotel window
he got me pinned down
you stay inside
jim grab on
leaving
pointing a gun at me again kate
i ought to kill you
but id rather see you hang
now kate
you lying sneaking murdering-
theyll be piling in here in a minute kate
you gotta let me go
why for what youve done to me
for what i used to mean to you
that was an idea i had
but you were never like the idea
well uh the good times we had
we had good times
think about them kate
what are you gonna gain if i die
youll never see me again
you got stan blaine and-
did i kill him kate
when i had a chance
when you asked me not to
kate did i kill him
there another reason
you gotta let me go
look kate look at this
how can i believe anything youve said
the last time-
let listen to him boys
thank you
i think we can
give credit for this to
cattle kate ive come to realize
that ive got to consider
your interests as well as mine
if you want to make a friend of me
think of my interests as well as yours
the west is gettinmaller friends and i
reckon weve gotta learn to live together
now im not the kind of man thatll throw
away the things that i worked hard for
who gave you that
he did
where is he
saddling up
where to maverick
could be california
maybe oregon territory
do you still think i was jim averell woman
that how it looked
because i cried
sure i cried but not because i love jim
i cried because when i found you
i realized i was all the things
i never wanted to be and because-
oh what do you know about women
or the way they feel
there a piece of bottom land
a few miles down
good for homesteadin
let have a look at it

but was acquitted
by a jury of his peers
my partner and i

how about felony murder
no drugs right
so no predicate felony
no conspiracy no nothing
no felony no felony
i cant believe this
no felony
how do you spell felony
homicide racketeering drugs
i mean what are we talking about
hey youre lucky
that white girl didnt die
iab is gonna interview
both of you
and do a preliminary report
over the next couple of weeks
now off the record
you actually didnt violate procedure
because the victim had a firearm
aimed at you
so if you stick together
you should make it through this
youd better get
your story straight too
cause im not going back to far rockaway
because you two fucked up
and youre gonna spend some couch time
with the rubber-gun squad
and youd better take this shrink seriously
or youll be off active duty
that fucking piece of shit
just walks
knock it off turk
relax partner
he gonna get his
gentlemen your questions
who made the decision to enter
i did
whose decision was it to enter
mine
did you immediately identify yourselves
as police officers
yes we did
did you immediately identify yourselves
the informant position
was becoming untenable
we were afraid she was in danger
turns out you were right
no fucking kidding nine-to-fiver
excuse me detective
are you finished with my client
theyre like lennon and mccartney
not an inch of daylight between them
what do you think
nothing there
they endangered the informant
we cant make them wrong on that
they saw a gun they reacted
they beat the fuck
out of the suspect
but he not filing charges
let see what the shrink says
so what are we gonna
do now doc
are we gonna find out
if im sane enough
to carry a gun chase bad guys
okay why did you become a cop
well it was new year eve
it seemed like a good idea at the time
i didnt have the same opportunities
you had dr prosky
where i come from
it was either a gun and a badge
or a hard hat and a hammer
how do you feel
when you fire your weapon
it like dirty harry said
there nothing wrong
with a little shooting as long as
the right people get shot
and when the wrong people
get shot
it sucks but id rather be in it
that out of it
there nothing worse
than being stuck on a bench
how do you feel when you see
innocent people get killed
you know
i sort of get numb to it
here
i want you to take this
use it to jot down your thoughts
your questions
anything you may have noticed
about yourself
whatever
i wont ask for it
just for you
i want you to try it
sounds like fun
harder
go turk go
you got third
go go
yeah
look at that
you own it you own it
no matter what they say
about you
youre tremendous
go go turk go
safe
you dropped the ball
a fucking cheap shot man
get away from the bag
or what or what or what
watch the bag
the nypd is bubbling
with frustration
hostility and testosterone
ready to erupt at any moment
think of me
as the release valve
one flick of the trigger
and the pressure goes down
you know why you join the force
to get respect
most people respect the badge
everybody respects the gun
hey riley i was talking to jo
you guys caught a stiff named
phillip trager a gun-runner
oh yeah a real piece of shit
how did that go down
i dont know
somebody gave him a taste
of his own medicine i guess
walked right into his apartment
killed him with one of his own guns
did the shooter leave a note
or anything
yeah actually
the shooter left a poem
he did
no shit
yeah hey simon
you remember that poem
from the trager case
what are you doing man
turk asking about it
what the hell are you doing
no le digas mierda a eso loco
calmate he wants to hear
about the poem
merchant of thieving class
i slit his throat
and capped his ass
i took his gun i took his
i took his life i took his gun
but too bad he not the only one
that how it goes
something like that
it not iambic pentameter
but it rhymes
rooster
yo
were looking for the same guy
he knocked off a pimp named rambo
a few weeks ago when was yours
last week were running ours with the atf
because of the guns
were back in business on the rambo case
looks like the same guy knocked off
a gun dealer on the three-three last week
no shit
what do you mean that our case
that our case youre taking our case
seniority guys
tag along youll learn something
oh tell me the guy name
is greg brady
please it is isnt it
oh somebody knocking off
the brady bunch
gotta be the partridge family
trager
a gun-runner bites the dust
number
the bullet matched the45
in trager apartment
that was no surprise
so i ran it through atf
it one of a batch of six
that was stolen from a gun shop
in virginia last month
yeah probably by trager
that what they think
he matches the description they have
it still doesnt help us find the guy
it just helps us tie him to the victims
which he already doing
with his little fucking poems
excuse me hello
hey turk dont forget
we got a court date later
so
i heard he kicked the shit
out of that dealer you guys took down
spider
so
did he
yeah he got him
down on the ground
the guy was handcuffed
and he just started
kicking him in the gut
and then
he gets down on the guy chest
and he really starts smacking him
hard in the face over and over
and screaming at the top
of his lungs
im gonna break
your fucking face
you little bitch
then his eyes really started
to fill up
i mean they get dark
you know how he gets
the sort of rage in him
i thought he was gonna
kill this guy
really
youre a bad little girl
i got work to do
you bet
counselor
my hands are tied here
without a secure
chain of custody
any evidence obtained
after the initial search
must be excluded
you gotta be fucking kidding me
therefore i am forced
to grant defense
motion to dismiss all charges
of rape and assault
against mr van luytens
your honor
you think i want this guy
going anywhere near my daughter
or anyone daughter
for that matter
you messed up
i am unleashing your client
unto the world
im sure well all be
back here again very soon
look at him
look at this motherfucker
hey it gonna come back to you mutt
youre gonna get it
when you walk outside watch your back
easy turk
order in my court
okay mutt you fucking mutt
not here not now
not here not now
will you get him out of here
before somebody passes a sentence
on him you cant appeal
order
you know what i mean go go
order detective
dr prosky suggested
that i free-associate
so here i go
you know what i think about
when i pull a trigger
i think about the infield fly rule
i love that fucking rule
it assumes the worst in everybody
it says sorry batter youre a schmuck
for popping up with runners on
and you stupid-ass infielder
you dont get to cheat
and drop the ball just because
you caught a break
my favorite part
the batter out
but the runners advance
at their own risk
well isnt this
a pleasant surprise
that the way life should be
you can be a motherfucker
at your own risk
or not
van luytens one less rapist
who gonna miss him
nobody
number 2 and counting
hot coffee
good morning detective riley
hey good morning
door on your left
any signs of forced entry
doesnt look like it
detective perez is in there
he in there already
all right
hey how about those mets last night
yeah how about em
hey teddy teddy come here
check this out
wow
fuck
oh my god
that big
and powerful
what a plasma screen
lcd
that plasma
no it got to be lcd
it wouldnt be that big
hey guys guys
he was shot at close range
dropped right here
the pussy doesnt look like he put up
much of a fight does he karen
nothing to indicate that
in terms of struggle
no forced entry cuts bruises
hey nobody wants to hear
about your private life officer corelli
that detective to you
officer needledick
looks like it our guy again
who did you get this time
this is jonathan van luytens
he owns a couple
of car dealerships
oh shit
he was up on rape charges
but they got tossed out
last week
look at this
a man devoid of all respect
of beauty charm or intellect
he took what women
would not give
he didnt have
the right to live
that our boy all right
looks like he had a beef
with our old pal johnny
you know him
yeah
he one slippery
son of a bitch let me tell you
yeah
you guys know how much
fun it is to not catch a serial killer
you got a point here lieutenant
the point is
youd better both
think seriously
about whether or not
you want the lead on this case
you dont think
were up to this
come on you got what
about 0 years on the job
between the two of you
im telling you you screw it up
badly enough
they may try to fuck you
out of your pension
you want to risk that
yeah
fuck yeah
406 lieutenant 406
okay 406
what does that mean
ted williams
ted williams the last day of the season
is batting 400
sox manager wants to bench him
protect his average right
williams plays
both games anyway
goes six for eight
ends up at 406
the last guy that ever hit
over 400
okay fine it all yours
just dont go moaning to me
when some traffic cop
pulls your serial killer over
for speeding
and he grabs your
5 minutes of fame and you realize
the asshole could have been
standing right there in front of you
and it would have taken you
000 light years to nail him
not for nothing lieutenant
light years measures distance
not time
well thank you detective
ill make a note of that
ellis lynde 2003
this guy had a history
of cruising gay bars
picking up twinkies
beating the shit out of them
lynde was found shot dead
in his apartment
whoever doing this
gets up real close to the guys
blows their brains out
without any trouble
leaves no fingerprints
and obviously
takes pride in his work
okay what could be
murder number two back from 04
one matthew mitrella
i was shaking
the first couple of times
i killed in cold blood
i kept thinking if i got caught
theyd kick me off the force
i wasnt worried about prison
but losing the gun and the shield
that scared me
i went into work the next day
expecting to feel different
i thought everybody would look at me
the way cops look at civilians
and know which ones are dirty
but they didnt
that when i knew
i could keep on
doing this forever
so next stop spider
if we shut down his business
maybe hed be a rat
we got a lawyer
we needed her to testify
that she bought coke from him
she was a good lawyer
me and my partner paid a visit
to club 404 of harlem
a word about him
tom cowen been my partner
for almost 30 years
he the best cop
ive ever seen
im always the one
following him through the door
there a bullet
that was meant for me
that lodged in his torso
he was my role model
the day i stopped
trying to be tom cowen
was the greatest day of my life
hey rooster
i was going through the files
on poetry boy
that an interesting way
to pass your time
okay there was a gun
found on charles randall
when he was arrested
yeah
now in all the other shootings
the gun was left at the scene
but there are a lot of similarities
so i mentioned it to perez and riley
i think somebody should go
interview him in prison
i think there may be a connection
that a good idea
but not perez and riley
i mean not those guys
theyll screw it up
this is too important
turk and i will handle randall okay
good work
detectives charles randall
what the fuck
do you two scumbags want
what a greeting
you like poetry chuck
what
do you like poetry
yeah
roses are red violets are blue
i want to poke out your fucking eyes
with my dick you fuck
how that
i thought youd rhyme
you didnt
fuck you
fuck both of you
get me out of here
why the fuck did we even bother
going out there
what would it look like
if we didnt go
are you gonna relax
relax
yeah ill just take it out
on karen later
the more im with her
the more abuse she wants
sounds like fun
hey you want to take her
off my hands
be careful partner because i have
a very special effect on women
go wild
whatever
i cant believe i had to face
that piece of shit and look like an idiot
eh fuck him
he where he belongs
im sorry partner
im really sorry
stop worrying about it
whatever happens
im not taking you down with me
dont worry about me
im all right believe me
i dont know what i was thinking
i just dont know what i was thinking
you know what you was thinking
you were thinking
about a 0-year-old girl
who had her skull crushed
yeah i tried to stop you
but you know what
i admired you that day
what you did
that was righteous
and you dont second-guess yourself
on something like that
okay im the killer
im the killer
i show up at your door
or your car window
and for some reason
you open your door
you roll down
your car window for me
so who am i
someone i know
maybe a nice set of tits
and the poems
what about the poems
you have to compose the poem
before you got there right
otherwise what youre gonna
blow out the guy brains
sit down and write a little sonnet
for yourself
no prints on the poems
so probably
i wore gloves when i wrote it
you obviously know your victims
between that and the easy access
i guess that they know you too
they must
these guys are all scumbags
theyre not gonna trust anyone
open the door for anyone
especially if they dont know them
yeah but i more than know them
i know everything about them
i know their moves
their patterns
i know their schedules
okay so youre following them
youre staking them out
anyone gonna say it
what
fuck me
he right it a cop
no
let slow down fellows
were getting way ahead of ourselves
come on it a cop you know it
i dont know shit neither do you
im telling your right now
it a cop it a cop it a cop
what do you mean
it a cop it a cop it a cop
where do you come off saying it a cop
easy partner he just saying it
what are you talking about
he just saying
i know i know i know
what he saying
and im saying it bullshit
shoot me what the fuck
but dont say it a cop
so what about dinner
you feel like going out
where
i dont care
youre the one going
what is your problem
no problem
if you feel like hanging around
be my guest
i dont feel like going out
fine just dont bug me
this is the best part of my day
and i dont need you fucking it up
so you only fuck cops
once in a while
i do a fireman or an ex-con
you lump us in together
well i have some respect
for firemen
fuck you
you know why they take away
your nightstick
when you hang up your uniform
no
they dont trust you with it
right now i wouldnt trust
myself with it either
shit youd probably love that
too bad you never met
van luytens
you two really would have
hit it off great
at least somebody finally
brought some justice down
on that dickless little fuck
now that is who id like to meet
well maybe youll get
your wish one day
they think it a cop
makes sense
bullshit
it just some fucking psychopath
well there plenty of those
on the job
are you sleeping well
not really
yep
eating well
no
yeah
any recurring nightmares
yeah that im stuck
in a room with you forever
nope
do you think youre fit
to return to duty
abso-fucking-lutely
yeah
you ever think about retiring
you mean death with benefits
what not to like
you ever think about retiring
not really
what have i got to look forward to
sailing my 26-footer
around sheepshead bay
umpiring cops softball
how about corporate security work
it too dangerous
so what are you gonna do
maybe ill buy a boat
all right look
i dont know if i believe this
but im just gonna
throw it out there
you guys say were looking
for one of our own
but what if it was an ex-cop
somebody with an ax to grind
you got one in mind
he thinking about martin baum
our old lieutenant
so what the story with him
he got fired a few years ago
im not saying there any motive
but he knew all the victims
yeah but turk
i knew most of those guys
so did you riley perez
even karen knew em
im just throwing it out there
well maybe you killed em
yeah maybe i did
the poems and the placement
of the weapons
are all weve got
linking the kills
which means what we gotta do now
is get humping on the forensics
that shouldnt be
too much of a problem
we already got the girl
working on that
that right karen been
humping on it all week as we speak
what did you say
here we go again
you should watch your mouth
oh yeah
he didnt mean anything by it
karen and him are ancient history
college boy cant speak for himself
yeah i can speak for myself
let me speak for myself
fuck you turk
mutt im gonna hit you
on the head with this barbell
im not better than you
youre not better than me man
you put your balls
in your pocket
and you fellow officers
a little courtesy
for a fellow professional you know
please are we gonna move on
here now
what are we doing
where were we
talking about martin baum
what his story
some guys under him
got caught taking money
baum stood up for them
tried to cover it up
he do time
well they pressed charges
but he plead out and resigned
so what his beef with you
i could have lied to protect him
but i didnt
okay but if he got a beef with you
why not go after you
why not kill you why go around
acting like a serial killer
killing all these degenerates
it doesnt make any sense
im just telling you
im telling you it doesnt make sense
im throwing it out there
im saying this is what it is
you want to check him out or not
i dont give a shit
it doesnt make any sense
youre the ones that think it a cop
im just saying here a cop
with a chip on his shoulder
check him out if you want
i dont give a shit
calm down and give a better reason
why baum could be a suspect okay
pms gotta be
hey guys
what going on
i came over to bring you
the fbi report
on the paper and handwriting
you dont have a problem
with me looking over the evidence
that i collected and processed
for you do you

i really am it a habit
habits can be broken right
that bullshit

why do you think
turk was so quick to take the lead
on the poetry case huh
to keep us from finding the killer man
that what i would do
if i was covering my tracks
he sticks us on this baum stakeout
cause it more misdirection
makes sense
i hate that turk man
hey he coming out
he coming out
oh at 245 in the morning
is it killing time
or is he just killing time
come on baum
go kill someone already
yeah kill turk man

he thinks he got a raw deal
that what passes
for police work these days
do you think you got a raw deal
damn straight
life sucks
yeah
everything okay simon
teddy where the fuck were you man
anything else you want to tell us
lieutenant baum
i got something for you in my pocket
huh
a passport credit card receipts
boarding passes
the day brady was killed
i was escorting a client
to brazil
judgment is
the dominion of the lord
and if this person
this worthless rapist
or murderer
as you describe him
if he is truly repentant
and seeks absolution
it must be granted to him
your name doesnt ring a bell
but ive had so many
altar boys over the years
so many altar boys
that it hard to remember
their names
my name is david fisk
detective first grade
you may not remember me now
but i guarantee youll remember my name
for the rest of your life
father connell
may he rot in hell
3 down one to go
white underwear below the knee
briefs-style
large tweezers
i am removing a card that has been
inserted in the rectum of the deceased
and placing it
in a plastic evidence bag
ill be right back
all right
hey it another one
handwritten
the old man
who the children trust
unable to control his lust
ashes to ashes dust to dust
the church cant stop him
someone must
ill see what else i can find
what the matter with you
father connell gave me
my first communion
back in bensonhurst
hey guys
sorry we didnt get a chance to call
yeah i bet you are
go over there take a look around
well compare notes later okay
looks like our friend just settled
an old score with the priest
left him with his pants down
come on
no look
come on dont talk like that
hey look for yourself
have a little respect
next thing theyre gonna tell us
lieutenant baum was an altar boy here
tell me about it
these two guys fucking stink
look doctor
you read the poems
it is possible right
that this guy is a cop
ive never seen it
ive never even heard
about a cop serial killer
come on girls
let go let go
yeah go go go go go
go go go go
safe
doc give us a tip
how are we gonna catch this guy
you dont have to worry
about that
he wants to get caught
you dont have any better place
to have lunch
i wanted to thank you
what about spider
yeah
and for looking in on me
at the hospital
and the encouragement
why would he want that
after a while
getting away with it isnt enough
so is your daughter on the team
no she used to play
but now she 25 living in california
five years sober
and working as a nurse
and her mother
her mother died
when she was very young
he wants everybody to know
that he got away with it
to show everybody
just how brilliant he is
most of these killings were criminals
in rooster and his beat right
and then he all but threatens
to kill van luytens
in front of hundreds of witnesses
and then he sends us
on this crazy wild goose chase
after lieutenant baum didnt he
yes he did
why would he do that why
you gotta show me more than that
so far you got shit
give him more man
you want more
how about the church records
the very ones that turk was
so diligently pursuing
how about that
it turns out our most recent victim
the late father connell
was moved all over the place
eight parishes in 20 years
why would they do that
with a catholic priest it obvious
he giving the children
more than communion behind the altar
now turk already admits
to knowing this guy as a child
it very plausible
this priest
this father connell
he gave you your first
holy communion eh
he did
did he every try to do
anything inappropriate i mean
i know what you mean
no never
okay fine
is there any reason
why somebody out there
might think that he did
no
am i a suspect here lieutenant
no
but these bodies
are starting to smell
a lot of it is drifting
in your direction
drifting or being pushed
what can i say
you got connections
to most of these victims
youre not exactly
mother teresa
i never had any problem
with that priest
okay okay fine
that settles it
i had a talk with riley and perez
good cops
dont fuck around okay
just listen
im listening
they think
turk might be our guy
oh man i gotta tell you
from where im sitting
that is so fucking funny
you cant take that seriously
everybody has pretty much
accepted the fact
that were chasing one of our own
but it aint turk
sure as im sitting here
he aint the guy
you know that
yes i do
how do you know that
because i know it
i know it to a moral certainty
okay
this priest
this father connell
he was turk priest
when he was a kid
he told you that
he didnt tell me this priest
was a child molester
i cant believe this bullshit
believe it all right
turk a good guy
you understand
he the best cop you got
dont you tell me what i gotta do
dont you say a goddamn word
to him about this either
or youre finished
can i speak now
feel free
he cares
you know what im saying
turk cares about people
i know he runs around
like a pit bull on crack sometimes
it doesnt matter
he cares about protecting people
and if you dont back him
you will regret it
jesus
sorry
i just never rattled
anyone cage before
got a minute
yeah what up
you know me and turk
are buddies right
of course
id do anything for him
he would do anything for you
would you

worried about togar

others see that he worried

no matter how afraid
he is at this moment
he still knows he has
to see this through
the whole meaning of his

and togar comes in wrecking it
here comes trouble
it a grand committee
but prentiss is with them
listen my friend let me talk
good morning everybody
i would like to
open this meeting
by reminding you all that
hank original idea
was a comparative study
of the great cats of the wild
and while observing
the african cats
in their natural habitat
he will raise several cats
of each species
be they african or otherwise
and to become almost like
a member of the pride
hey it has stripes it must
be another tigon or a liger
the mother a lioness
the father must be a tiger
say hello to henry
the jaguar would ya
not today
what are you trying to prove
that you can have lions
socializing with people
no but we cant keep
exterminating them
we cant keep
eliminating their land
we cant keep
exterminating everything
that we fear or that
inconveniences us
let the zoos keep them alive
prentiss your actions
arent necessary
the government knows
there a better way
theyre moving the people out of
the migration paths
i dont know what kind of person
could look in the
eyes of 200 elephants
and put out those lights
they run frantically in panic
trying to protect
their children--
do you think your lions
would run and panic
you better start with me first
no ill start with
the tigers first
thatll teach you for
bringing them to africa
i gotta go help your uncles;
theyre killing each other
stop it stop it hey hey
calm down
togar
togar togar
you stay out of it you let
robbie take care of him
yeah you guys are smart;

come on come on davie
i think i drove togar as
far away as 200 miles
this is the first
time he come in
i have a hunch that
robbie and togar
could be brothers
you know bugsy and robbie
were both rogue lions
i found them dying
from battle wounds
now if togar were sick or dying
these guysd
probably accept him
but the way he is now --
vicious alright
well he cant help that
as a loner he too slow to
catch his normal dinners
and the hungrier he gets
the more desperate he gets
the more desperate he gets
the more ferocious he gets
because the only way he
can eat most of the time
is by taking his meals
from whole prides of lions
you gotta be pretty
ferocious to do that
sooner or later he
gonna get killed
come on gary
billy

he too slow to catch his normal diner
and the hungrier he gets
the more desperate hell get

better to be apart for a while
you know absence makes
the heart grow fonder
the heart maybe

beauty of restraint and self-denial

-----NewMovie-----
you should let those cats out
once in a while
outside they couldnt survive
they were bred for degeneracy
like a whore
there harder work
when
in a week
here is a film
of colonel saran zim president of eritrea
as he steps from the plane bringing him
to paris from the middle east
on the first leg of his tour
of the nato countries
zim was met by french foreign minister
pierre croyez
and minister of state jacques cassente
russian advisers attached to zim
accompanied him
even on this mission to the west
a strong security force
surrounded the dapper colonel
as he made his way toward the podium
this is the moment
an assassins gun fires
causing panic on the tarmac
as one of the special police falls
ministers and officials run for cover
another shot kills zim bodyguard
emilio rocca
lights used to floodlight the area
were spun round to illuminate
a nearby hangar
from the roof bursts of fire
from an automatic rifle
police returning fire
run to surround the hangar
leaving zim and his entourage
mooing for coven
two more police died in the ensuing battle
while police
were distracted by the rooftop assassin
another shot from the darkness
of the airport
and salan zim fails dead
here is an action replay of the moment
as colonel satan zim of eritrea
meets death from an unknown assassin
meantime french police
shot and mortally wounded
the young arab whose fire from the roof
had killed four men
he carried papers identifying him
as yusef belabar a student from eritrea
a member of the extreme
left-wing soldiers of revolution group
already in eritrea
government forces have raided
the of fices of 7 left-wing
do you ever count the dead cross
youre beautiful jean
but sometimes you have
the bad breath of priests
did you see the opposition
i saw him
what zharkov doing on the plane
how many times
you been out with me
six maybe seven
youre good jean
better than good
youre smart you understand
but that still leaves you
a contract button man
necessary only because the cia
doesnt hold with doing its own killing
washington
does the boy go into your report
he the headliner
why did he want to kill zim
nosy arent you
good evening madame
bonsoir monsieur
monsieur
boy saw zim as a fascist a brutal pig
a tool of american imperialism
he wanted a crack at him
i bought him a ticket
if he had got him
mademoiselle sil vous plait
youd have picked up
your money with no sweat
merci
if zim was america man why kill him
for your education
zim dead at the hands of the left
serves his government and mine
better than zim alive
but it not his death that important
it who appeared to have
killed him that counts
one more thing for your education
the more a man tells you
the more dangerous you become to him
and the more dangerous you become
the shorter the options on your future
your sister still work at air france
uh-huh
is she meeting you
she doesnt know im here
sarah picking me up in a car
can i give you a lift
i thought the rules said
we were strangers from here on in
they bend

upstairs bedroom

people used to tip big in those days

he sees heck as being in the enemy camp
he right
youre gonna tell him
im gonna tell him today
mcleod not gonna have a good morning
hell handle it
hell feed it into his computer
for the proper reaction
maybe we should just go
you know like the arabs and not
and not tell mcleod
you start to run
everyone wants to know why
then they make up the answers
to their own questions
i thought i just saw someone
in helen kitchen

mr mcleod would like to see you

no trouble just let me get my bag
ill get it for you sir which one
there
where the hell are you going
with that bag give me that bag
good morning sir
ail you had to do
was keep your heads dawn
and cross would have walked
right into this office to file his report
and what dyou do
you crawl halfway up his ass
who did you think you were following
some second-hand car dealer
from oshkosh wisconsin
cross is the best
now he running free
and all ive got
is one operative with a cut head
another being held by the local police
as a drug-addict homosexual
and one beat-up car
mr mcleod you said to check him
in and keep an eye on him and
oh get out
how is harris
still in a state of shock
cross forced a harmless hay fever pill
into his mouth told him it was cyanide
from an sd kit
beautiful
shall i bail the dummy out
no let him sweat
i cant let this get upstairs fil
if we throw this one
the chiefll come down hard
we have to get cross
ive got every man on it
but without fbi or locals
were carrying a handicap
the bureau would love
to get their hands on this mmm-mmm
no no one outside the agency
blanket everything
every exit operate every contact
ill put it nationwide well box him in
flight for toronto
is 75 due in 80
then the big one toronto-vienna
it leaves at 825 and it
a fast-track ab the way
youll be there at 530 in the morning
30 in the afternoon their time
put it in your shoe jack
cant you read the sign maintenance
too much
i made the connections
as fast as i could like you said
there are no through bookings
nothing traceable
in pittsburgh your tickets will be
waiting for you at the national desk
under the name father henderson
at chicago go to the united desk
there youre father kitts
at toronto it air canada
under the name father wieland
and your english is not so good
let get moving
tell me how do you like my place
very much
ive 75 students of english literature
i teach nine classes a week
and our new term starts next week
and i love you
how do you like paris
better watch out jean
you make one promise
and ill hold you to it
okay father
goodbye my son bless you
goodbye goodbye goodbye
hello
what are we buying for each other
ill pay my dues
how much did my sister tell you
she said thered be pain
did she talk about algeria
she said that you were
a lieutenant in the paratroopers
when i think of it im afraid arent you
i picked you up remember
i only talked anne into
sharing an apartment with me
so id have an excuse to be around
we cant all miss mister okay
let give it a search
make a move jockey
and ill splash you across the sheets
it heroin
you son of a bitch get out of bed
pull it in
jean
youve two ways to walk scorpio
down that corridor that 30 years long
or with me
this is washington national airport
the picture shows passengers
boarding this afternoons 55 flight
pittsburgh pennsylvania
would you say that was cross
without an element of doubt
some airports have a television eye service
they keep a video tape running
which they erase the next day
i had a hunch
and it paid
it should have been fairly easy
to trace the destination of a priest
normally washington airport
wouldnt have too many priests
departing around 500 or so
but today was the last day
of a conference of teaching brothers
more than 300 priests departed
in all directions
between 300 and 600 pm
cross amongst them
brilliant
oh i agree
he had to have help
no messenger boys
the plan was cross
would you agree to that scorpio
mm-hmm
well our first piece of common ground
you boys can pack it in for the night
you were supposed
to kill cross at the paris job
no contract
you took the money
you left the money
why
cross had his contract in first
i dont play games when the rules are bent
no one bends them faster than cross
never with me
i want cross and i want him burned
you know him best
find him
you make too many mistakes
like
you confuse what you want
with what i want
mister you dont have
too much ground to dance on
i could drop you for the heroin
or tag you for the paris killing
now your government
would like more names
your second mistake mcleod
cross gave me enough information
on each operation we did together
not conclusive but enough
to make a strange reading
you cant let me go into a public court
what do you want
i want inside
where
beirut
you want cross job
if you get cross you get his posting
more
more
$25000
where cross
more
you run it right to the edge dont you
what
i want to know the reason
executive order
you dont question a directive
in the agency scorpio
im not in the agency until i get cross
the reason
he a face a double agent
he sold to the opposition
and he has a lot more to sell
do you know where cross is or dont you
i dont but a man named zharkov will
serge zharkov
he soviet intelligence
in cairo cross opposite
you think hell go to zharkov
zharkov will go to him
but not in the middle east in europe
europe is a big place
i want internal replay on serge zharkov
who else have you got to send
against him but me
where do i send you
where zharkov and cross have met before
a place they both know
a place where zharkov
could have a safe house
ready on zharkov
sergei zharkov
born kiev 94 educated in leningrad
doctor of philosophy
and political history and economics
fought in spain with the thalmann brigade
arrested in moscow 939
and sentenced to six years ham labor
rehabilitated in 943 assignment balkans
little information
until his posting to iraq in 952
speaks fluent german arabic
french english hebrew
associated operatives karim
ludmann
zemetkin
replay operatives
associated operatives karim
ludmann
zemetkin
hold on zemetkin
listen when i came over
you promised me asylum
we also promised you questions
yes
and i answered all your questions
why am i in the airport
youre going back to moscow zemetkin
you gave us no more than we already knew
you were cute and well-conditioned
and all that stuff
about freedom had brass edges
you ran because you were
playing pat-a-cake with state funds
okay we let it ride
but now we want
a little interest on our investment
zharkov
when zharkov isnt in the middle east
and he isnt at home where is he
maybe a former picnic ground
not too east and not too west
somewhere the barriers are down
i dont know such a place
i would tell you if i knew
your plane
aeroflot flight 379 direct to moscow
al the other end
youll be well and truly met
648 to ilyushin 009 over
youre murdering me
federal protective
service officer 7463 over
man t ready to board
passenger andrew zemetkim oven
standing by over
man t dropping lounge
boarding platform in five seconds oven
how about vienna huh
jean girlfriend; vienna
im sorry
what about the police
a mistake
the man who had the room
before me forgot to pack everything
some mistake
how long will you be away can i come
impossible anyway you have to teach
is it going to be dangerous jean
no why should it be
weve already contacted
our people in vienna
youll be given
every facility total cooperation
and you can draw expenses
mcleod depending on you scorpio
spain was a long time ago
the best died there
there a house on the kurrentgasse
on the corner go there
where are we going
get in
you dont talk very much
i have nothing to say
i see you still have
a flair for the theater zharkov
it adds color
these drivers your people
not official old comrades
i hear you are running cross
what else do you hear
mcleod ordered the wet stuff
there a gun out for you
when did you know
a week before you did
who have you got in your pocket
actually i buy from a bulgarian
who works for the chinese
your place
yours if you need it
no one knows about it
not my company not your company
just friends a few and trustworthy
and the rent
take it on trust
thank you
there will come a time cross
when those who sit above me
will want you delivered
theyll give me so much play
in the rope and then theyll pull it in
and then
moscow is nice in the spring
there a long winter i hear
how are you going to get your wife out
ill get her out
come over theyll get her out for you
no sergei no moscow
i want out not just a change of sides
sit down cross
the offer of the hide still goes
and when the rope begins to wind in
ill tell you
and youll know where to find me
in vienna i could find you anywhere
have you noticed cross
that we are being replaced
by young men with bright stupid faces
a sense of fashion
and a dedication to
nothing more than efficiency
keepers of machines pushers of buttons
hardware men with highly complex toys
and except for language
not an iota of difference
between the american model
and the soviet model
to dinosaurs
maybe you can kill cross alone though i
wouldnt put my little yellow basket on it
but youre not gonna find him alone
not out there
am i wasting my breath
no i was listening
and so far youve said
nothing that lit any candles in the dark
you have no proof
that cross and zharkov are in vienna
you have no one on your staff
that knows zharkov
but you did get around
to checking customs
and eight priests arrived by air
in the last three days
two from north america mitchell
it is mitchell isnt it
well mitchell
which of the two was cross
the one on twa from new york
or the one on air canada from toronto
no way of telling
father wieland was cross
air canada from toronto
yes i know horse players that
play hunches and hot flushes
horse players die broke
if cross had flown
from washington to new york
he would have caught the pan am flight
but there was no priest on that flight
he wouldnt have waited
seven hours for a twa flight
never stand still when you run
and never run in a straight line
that the first thing cross taught me
cross is an organizer
he plans down to the finest margin of error
you cant follow his mistakes
so you follow his skill
washington to pittsburgh or cleveland
two possibles
cleveland or pittsburgh to chicago
chicago to toronto
toronto to vienna
not more than 20 minutes in any one place
and less than 2 hours in all
wieland fits
all the majesty of europe
have you ever been to the hermitage
paintings there that seize your breath
stop being a guide sergei
what have you got for me
arrivals
then they know you are here i guessed
you never guess
a defector zemetkin a petty thief
mcleod had his thumbs on him
he knew about vienna
and the hide
only those i trust know that
i could have this one killed
no
i would offer you coffee cross
but the sugar would attract too many flies
everyone cross used to know in vienna
everyone cross used to know
that you know
were monitoring
telephone calls to america
telegrams and radio telegrams
i want the tapes brought here
weve got a watch on all the embassies
but if cross doesnt move
hell be damn near invisible
hell move hell try to get his wife out
hell need funds and help
not if he goes over
he wont
mcleod thinks he might
if he was going over
hed be in moscow not vienna
the trouble with mcleod
is that he thinks like mcleod
you know what a dybbuk is mitchell
some son of jewish sprite or ghost
a spirit that invades another human form
im the dybbuk of cross labyrinth mind
i live inside him
hell move
he in here
ive assigned novins and dor to assist you
theyre both viennese both very good men
of course as far
as the embassy is concerned
you dont exist so dont call for help
cross
you have some time max
until 300 but longer if you want
you hungry
i can hold out if we hurry
come on
it june
strauss and strauss and strauss
a little mozart a little brahms
then strauss and strauss and strauss
vienna is the only city that puts

done it in paris jean
the price wasnt right
and now it is
yes now it is
i could kill you jean
take it then cross
it wont come around again
can we talk
sure
mcleod name my sin
he said you sold and had more to sell
and you believe that
is it true i want to know
for your education no it isnt true
zharkov
what about zharkov
he is the opposition
ive known zharkov for almost 30 years
as an ally as an enemy
and always as a friend
were both premature antifascists
as they used to say in washington
but zharkov hasnt sold out
and neither have i
then why does mcleod want you dead
why dont you ask him that
im asking you
youre looking for god shining face
arent you jean
something to believe in
like a young girl
in a white communion dress
but youve got the soul of a torturer
so your need is greater
you lied to me cross and you used me
for that im going to kill you
i never lied to you jean
i used you but i never lied to you
not my doing cross i swear
dont trust mcleod
he ordered you dropped twice
damascus and marseilles
that why i gave you so much
information on each job
something to bargain with
you owe me jean
where
he up there
you had him last night and you let him go
that how it looks in my report
to washington
unless youve got something to change it
dor says you didnt even try
to get a shot off
where the hell do you think youre going
never put your hands on me
cross im off until tuesday
i want you to call washington for me
the number and the message
is in that envelope
okay -
repeat the message exactly as it written
yes
call from a phone box
you still dont have any questions
what answers could you have
that would make any difference
i love you cross
and i you max that why i must
tell you there could be pain in this
i have been inoculated
you know cross
i used to think
that the only music i would ever hear
no matter what i was really playing
was the music we played each morning
when the others went out to work
or the music for the selection
when the lucky ones went into the showers
now i can hear brahms
and not crying
but one image has never blurred
cross you coming through
that gate and taking me home
oh for
theyre pulling in the net both sides
they want you delivered cross
i cant go back you know that
not after this kind of a move
not even if the soviets took the leash off
but your wife
ill have her out in two days
do you know why mcleod hates you cross
because you are
one of donovan adventurers
the last of the knights templar
you dont stand up straight
you have your hands in your pockets
show no respect
and tonight you are going
to get drunk with a russian
and we are going to get drunk cross
what was it you used to say
falling down drunk
falling down drunk
and then well get maudlin
we will sing i will cry
and then i will tell you
some very funny stories
tell mother
to take the books back to the library
they are overdue
give her my love
and tell her not to carry things
just a man calling his mother mitchell
only two things dont wash mitchell
he called a public phone in washington
and he doesnt have a mother
his whole family died in the camps
you didnt crosscheck each one mitchell
and you cost me a day
you are so damn quick
to write notes to mcleod
put that in mitchell
i traced it back to a max lang
he used a phone booth
in a cafe near the state opera house
you knew that mitchell
but you didnt go there
dead end
it could have been a dead end
but lang needed more change
he asked one of the waiters
the waiter knows him
he is a cellist mitchell
and even more important
he was in the resistance
when cross was liaison
the whole goddamn things redundant
there are no more secrets
at least none worth stealing
it a lower form of life
its reason of existence is
its reason to exist
what the hell are you doing
jesus sergei
you even hide things from yourself
tell me what keeps you from burning out
hmm
you see before you
the last of a race of giants
no no no i mean seriously
seriously
i still believe im still a communist
communist for christ sakes
after what youve seen
youve seen it turn brutal inhuman
no cross ive seen men use it badly
what about the trials the purges
trials purges they are words
you have read somewhere cross
my trial was so grotesque
my hours of interrogation
so terrible that i was numb
it was a kind of
frontal lobotomy without anesthetic
and the labor camps
where men good communists old fighters
men who believed
in the dignity of man above all else
were used as drought animals
to pull logs on frozen feet
that this could be the result
of all i had committed my life to
but baby at that moment
didnt you realize what was happening
at that moment i tried to
understand what had happened to me
most of us there were communists
not stalinists that is why we were there
nothing had happened
to make me renounce myself
i was still a communist
stalin couldnt take it away from me
and now the dull gray stupidity
that sends the tanks into prague
because ii has no imagination
it cant take it from me either
i am still a communist
youre still an idiot
you still serve that dull gray stupidity
and when they pull the wire on me
ill deliver you to them cross
yesterday at 620
sarah cross received a local phone call
the same message as the one monitored
in vienna to someone here in washington
we have no trace on that someone
she left the house at 705
notice the handbag
it big enough to carry a package
say the size of a book without it showing
she went to this storage house
cross kept some middle eastern
furniture and artifacts there
from the time he sent
his wife home from cairo
she signed in got the keys
and went upstairs
she was inside six minutes
she told the inventory clerk
she had to measure a cabinet
she signed nothing out
she left and drove to
the library of congress building
we got no film inside that building
but one of our operatives followed her
the place was crowded with tourists
and it was nearly closing time
now she spoke to no one
deposited nothing
simply wandered through the exhibit halls
however on her way out she had to pass
through a group on a conducted tour
no way to check persons on tour
she exited the building at 749
could be a drop
but did she make her connection
probably someone in that tour group
or she could have picked something up
just as easily
passport ticket escape details
she due to run
i want her place searched
get heck thomas he lives behind her
to invite her for drinks dinner anything
then get a contract thief
to get one of our men in there
brief him on what
he might be expected to find
make it look like a routine housebreaking
the thief s gotta leave prints
well give him shelter
where is cross
nothing he had this in his pocket though
the phone message
cross handwriting ill talk to lang
he dead he wouldnt talk
the car box him in
you stay up here
cross
im tired helen
and ive been very bad company
so thank you and say good night
to heck for me all right
come over for coffee in the morning
okay -
i know about music
hey honey were out of booze again
there a couple more
in the kitchen darling
no that gone too
uh whered sarah get to
she gone home she got the dumps
jesus no
heck
she gone back to her house
should i go after her
no dont get involved call him warn him
im going over there
jesus christ what happened in there
now
more of your litter mr mitchell
always with access to my superiors
i dont like your type in my streets
ive lost another man
and that bastard thinks it funny
youve lost more
than another man mitchell
youve lost zharkov
that means weve lost cross
it might just be that cross
would be more valuable more cooperative
if we helped him without conditions
we dont think so
alex you dont think you take orders
and so do you zharkov
your orders are the same as mine
put cross on tomorrow flight to moscow
your apparent intimacy with this man
could be interpreted
you know alex you remind me
of someone i used to know
who
funny he never told me his name
like you he was building his career
on a passionate belief in obedience
he took his revolution from books
his marxism from easy-to-swallow
predigested pap
he was building socialism in one country
with the bones from a charnel house
there were a lot of them around in 939
i cant give you any more time cross
two days
my head on a tray
malkin
another keen son of a bitch
better get dressed
you know sergei
i might be better than you in a closed room
dont even think about it
for you
do me one favor cross
run as fast and as far as you can
youve nothing but enemies now
both sides
dont catalog
the excuses through the alphabet
you got it cleaned up
morrison in the hospital
with our own medical people in attendance
it a bad wound
the thief
he ran untraceable so far
no one untraceable
damp down the police search
we dont have the means
over their heads we do
if milne found dead
thatll make for more questions
more questions make for deeper probes
all right
all right but get morrison
out of washington fly him to panama
it is a bad wound
i wont cry if the goof dies
change your mind my friend
ive bad news cross
our sister sarah has gone to her rest
in the peace of christ
with faith and hope of eternal life
let us commend sarah
to the loving mercy of our father
the hunter home from the hill
id buy a plot here soon mr mcleod
it a nice cemetery
you think im responsible for this
cross will
and you think hell come back
dont you
we have evidence that he in moscow
then burn incense in front of it mcleod
and pray
from our end the contract is still open
why the bahnhof
all faces are anonymous in railway stations
youre sure there will be no trouble
he there packed and ready
to make the trip
the negatives and prints
are on their way to moscow
there is a limited interpretation possible
but an accompanying report
clarifies the more shadowed areas
and you are seeing cross off
you might try denial but ii is a weak plea
and at best would leave you
open to charges of incompetence
i suggest you defect
cross zharkov getting off
a soviet ilyushin aircraft
this photo reported to have been taken
from the observation roof
of the moscow airport
lab says could be but no hard evidence
cross here shaking hands with three vips
zharkov in the background
that indicates the three are high-ranking
no telling who these two are
but this one in profile could be stolypin
head of the arab section in moscow
notice this maintenance vehicle
the lab blew it up
and it definitely has the markings
and plate numbers of moscow
now that the first hard evidence
all the rest are blow-ups
to examine everything in detail
weve combed it out tight
the results say it probably is moscow
but could be prague or budapest
okay torn
where zharkov now
cairo
flew directly there from moscow
the opposition is chortling
about some coup
cross has gone over
scorpio still expects him
the frenchman a loser
you could have had that beautiful
abyssinian in the pet shop he was lovely
i like street cats
im going to call you sun tzu
who on earth is sun tzu
a great scholar of war wasnt he cat
i bet he has fleas
it a sign of his independence
i wanted to buy you
something lovely and exotic
you wanted
to buy me something i wanted
all right ill take this one
okay but there no charge lady
if you want 0 give something there
a donation box in front of the office
okay -
should we give him anything special to eat
oh no no you can use anything
any scraps from the kitchen
if he hungry hell eat anything
just a word mr laurier
a few minutes please
mcleod has closed the cross file
is that a polite warning
no im here on my own
id like your opinion
you know my opinion
that airport could be moscow
could be
we think it is
but could be prague or budapest
that careless geography
you uh
you still think cross will come back
if that was moscow theyd hardly let him
pose for few photographs and then leave
would they
i dont know where ii is
and i dont know
what the russians might or might not do
but i know what cross will do
what do you think i should do
sit in mcleod chair and see if it fits
it will be vacant soon
weve got a fix on the thief
his name paul milne he running scared
id hit him tonight cross
he might be gone by tomorrow
he a third-term man
so he down for life
without a killing on his sheets
with that bonus the law should
be breathing hard down his back
but there no heat
the story is around that the man downtown
has been told to cool it
and doesnt like it
the grumble goes high up
you think they could put a fix in
they might if they had a good reason
what this milne form like
housebreaker jimmy and soft-shoe stuff
he never been caught
with a gun or a blade
ive asked around
but nobody says he shot your wife
but you know where to find him
what the hell is this
who are you guys
no jesus that gas
who are you
match
holy mother of god
the job where the woman was killed
i didnt kill her i dont carry a gun
who
i was hired this guy
i dont even know his name
did he tell you what to look for
notebook a small package
paper letters anything with writing on it
did he shoot her
yes
the lady comes in sudden
and she got this gun
she opened up on him and he blasted her
cross
give up smoking thief
it bad for your health
so now you know
now i know
how are you gonna get that guy
if he as big as you say he is
he aint gonna be no lady godiva
miff wilson
cross man it gonna cost you
i can afford it
ive saved enough to buy a mountain
i wont need any more
i know youre out there cross
i can feel it
miff
cross
how are you
great
got a minute let step outside
sure
sure
miff remember the job
you did for me in michigan
i want you to take care of someone for me
hell be coming clown the street
in a black cadillac car
hey nut
what are you doing
theyre beautiful
were going to paris
when
tomorrow well get an apartment
youve got an apartment
a new one
youre crazy you know that
crazy out of your skull
no
i love you
if anything happens to me
if im stopped at the airport
or anything like that
take this to the french embassy
to a gil mousseau
gil mousseau
and give it to him
hell know what to do
no dont ask now
ill tell you soon in paris
are you in trouble jean
no that my insurance policy
you know im old-fashioned enough
to buy you a ring
and i know a place
that makes a good breakfast
see you on monday fil
have a good lunch
bloody martini circuit
damn town runs on olives and small talk
this is it
is this the place
thisll be okay
right on
you drive on
stay here mr mcleod ill see to it
dont move me
call an ambulance
dont move me
mr mcleod sir
quick quick get an ambulance
your flight leaves dulles airport at 750
good luck
thanks
i will see you over there
yeah
mr laurier
you were right scorpio
we should have listened to you
are you going to fulfill your contract now
im out
we still want cross
hell make contact now
with the opposition one last big delivery
youve shown me no proof
that cross was a traitor
youve got a handful of maybes
you cant buy 0 minutes
of my time with that
proof you want proof
what do you think mcleod was
a psychopath
some sick mind that
went about ordering killings
to make his days interesting
no he was a professional
like cross but with a difference
he was honest
he had only two gods efficiency and duty
cross is a double agent
in intelligence all evidence is
of necessity circumstantial
but cross had bank accounts
with considerable assets in zurich
under the number 30-98-7
you can see it written down there
in his handwriting
checked out against a signature
on his american express credit card
in that account alone he had $238000
down this year to $24000
by the way scorpio
you can hold the picture on screen
or close in on it
by using that panel in front of you
his next account turned up in panama
this time under the name
robert crosthwaite
credit $9500
he also has a dallas bank account
under the name gerald cross
assets as of january 73 $60000
i grant you field work demands
trading with the opposition
cross knew men like zharkov but
here he is with raymond hussein in paris
a man who he told us he had never met
here with robert simmonds in beirut
another name that never
appears in his field reports
cross again in an arab guerrilla camp
with salem demoum
all these men were responsible
for receiving substantial information leaks
from unidentified sources
leaks that could have come from cross
so when cross wife
returned to washington
we put her under surveillance
now we have reason to believe
that she was being used as a delivery
now this was filmed by
one of our agents when she left the house
shortly after the message
you monitored in vienna
was called through to washington
she went to this storage house
cross kept some belongings there
then she left went directly
to the library of congress building
we believe to pass a message
it was very crowded there with
tourists she may have made a drop
our agent couldnt be sure
because he wasnt allowed
to photograph in the building
she left there at 549
just before closing time
a picked you up remember
i only talked anne into
sharing an apartment with me
so i had an excuse to be around
i picked you up remember
good night bye-bye
jean
jean
youll have to look me in the eye
when you kill me jean
that wont bother me not this time
no youre a one-talent man frenchman
you took this contract cause you wanted
inside you wanted my job
and you needed a mcleod
to carry your sins for you
i was finished with you cross
i was going home tomorrow with her
she was my way out
im sorry about the girl truly sorry
but i had no part of her plans
she was a czech courier and very good
a lot of hard work went
into collecting this
go ahead scorpio it should be easy
youd be doing both of us a favor
and there an outside chance
they might let you live
two for one
there a room just down the hall
from mcleod office
where grown men play a game
it a bit like monopoly
only more people get hurt
there no good and no bad
jesus
the object is not to win
but not to lose
and the only rule is to stay in the game
-----NewMovie-----

all-american red-blooded male

while he was in london
for the past two weeks ow
so i could make
the team and beat cornwall ow
whoa
but my brother
came home early
and that who you saw kissing olivia and that who played the first half
just because you wear a wig

all im asking for
is a chance
duke
it just like what coach says
before every game
be not afraid of greatness
some are born great
some achieve greatness

it a tie score at the bottom of the second half

-----NewMovie-----
shoot lots of closeups
found anything yet
just a collection of compacts
here inspector
thanks
no fingerprints inspector
naturally
and no other leads
no
here the permission
to remove the body
so early
the examining magistrate in a hurry
alright
the hearse is here
inspector
inspector
just carry on
are you finished here
yes couldnt find anything
so sweet so dead
they were slashed with a blade
a very sharp one
in the area of the mouth
and the chin
there are marks of a hand
like a vice
l believe the deed
happened like this
he must have
grabbed her like this
and then the mortal cut
and the other injuries
a series of uncontrolled stabs
but not to the living person
but to
the dead body
to stab someone like that
you must hate him
or be a maniac
photos were found next to the woman
showing her in the arms of a man
a lover presumably
his face was made unrecognizable
it possible
as soon as youre finished doctor
id like to have your report
certainly inspector
in full detail
shall we go
l examined the photos
left beside the body
if we figure out
why the man face was erased
we might have a lead
why not
the face was scratched away
with a razor or something similar
we could blow up the photos to see
if there are any moles or other blemishes
but then what
should we ask every male in town
to strip for us
id take a look around
the environment of the victim
right but unfortunately
that a very closed world
she was the wife
of a general
you think her friends will tell us
with whom she went to bed
and what do you
intend to do now
ill throw out the net
and hope well catch
all the right fishes
you said at the day in question
you had some tests done at the hospital
youre just wasting
your time with me
l dont go to whores
and i pity the guys who do poor fellas
ah yeah maybe you hate them
isnt that right cleopatra
all men should be brothers
l really dont hate anybody
and why do you keep saying murderer
could be a lady
yes sure
and what would you be
one who doesnt get on anybody tits
on the contrary
her husband a general untouchable
be quiet
inspector
inspector sir
those losers
it always us
yeah right
look who coming
hey cleopatra how the pharaoh
good one
i got rid of the journalists
theyre always expecting a miracle
if they were in our place
found out anything
no these folks belong to
a whole different circle
well i think it no use
but keep interrogating them
im going home
alright inspector
call me if you need me
sure thing
aw the asshole taking off
and were supposed to spend the night here
are you paying for the business i lose
calm down calm down
now well type up
a nice report
after that you may all go back
to your honorable jobs
his job
aint too shabby either
what bothering you
try to stay calm
relax
and stop worrying
so much
yes it easy to say that
this is worse than the mob
just unbelievable
no trace of her lover
what did you expect
and who should name him
the betrayed husband the parents
think of the scandal
the problems are always
for those left behind
like me for instance
the papers are attacking us
and the commissioner gave me hell
bring me some proof
and do it quick
try harder capuana
but be very careful
dont step on anybody feet
im begging you
that the motto
do it make him happy
what can it cost you
and how should i do that
every step i take
is wrong
today everything different
l cant question people anymore
that the
magistrate job now
if you catch one
he wont spill the beans
or shows up
with his lawyer in tow
if they dont say anything
there nothing i can do
whoever the murderer is
how it possible
he didnt leave any traces behind
he very smart
and cunning
but these photos of the naked victims
and their lovers
they have some purpose
theyre our lead our only one
do you think
he from around
l think so yes
he acted very skillfully
didnt you say we have
to leave here earlier
unfortunately yes
you know how it is
with my husband
when he organizes a bridge evening
he furious when im late
l better get going then
but you should
hurry too serena
first i have to make myself
presentable gianni
to me
you already are
did you know that you look best
when youre naked
didnt anybody tell you yet
what this
an interrogation
you want me to confess
l wont fall for that
so you have been
told that before
you dont seem to object
do you
just keep playing
with me
ill see you soon
yes
no no
no no
another young woman
found massacred at the beach
all policemen of the town
are looking for leads
that might
convict the killer
your panic
is absolutely unjustified
no one could recognize you
in that photo
i advice you as your lawyer
to stay calm
let them do their work
but somebody knows about serena and me
so what
that inspector
is clever
he cares about his position
and his career
stay calm
he knows he has to move very carefully
with the most guarded discretion
but maybe hell get the wrong ideas
with a butchered woman
the first suspect
will be the lover or the husband
yes yes that right
but not in our circles
the first victim
was the wife of a general
and the second one your poor serena
she had an important name
one of the really important people
and now what should i do
go on living
like nothing happened
and if the inspector
does show up one day
you call me
right away
hello daddy
im sorry
l thought you were alone
were finished i was about to leave
how are you
fine thanks
is there a problem
no problem
we can discuss it later bye
bye
dont take off okay
go play tennis
dont forget the bridge evenings
business as usual
and try to stay calm
alright ill do my best
but it not gonna be easy
this second murder
is a carbon copy of the first one
the murder weapon
was the same too
everything matches
the fioravanti case
even the method used in killing her
and the photos with the lover
how did
the husband react
he in a state
of collapse
he didnt suspect his wife
to be a whore
but are you sure he had nothing to do
with the murder of his wife
maybe he just pretending
maybe he was out for revenge
we checked his alibi
it all in order
were also keeping an eye
on her lover
we know he consulted
his lawyer
but nothing else
no misstep
it sure would be odd if hed taken
photographs of himseif and his mistress
and then put them
next to her corpse
even if his face was erased
sure
that gastone
the one who prepares
the cadavers
he always laughs like that
when he approves of his own work
come have a look
come in come in professor
hello gastone
you cant see the cut
on her throat anymore
and also the other injuries
look you too inspector
look she beautiful
gastone is an artist
a real artist
with wax and make-up
he makes miracles
he loves his work
now dress her put her in the coffin
and set it up in the mortuary
her parents will be here in an hour
okay
how beautiful you are
almost prettier than when you were living
stop
rewind it a little
why what did you see capuana
these are only people
we already know
all of them unsuspicious
go ahead
stop keep it there
it terrible
poor serena she really
didnt deserve to die like that
such a horrible death
that true
and her husband
did you see him
a broken man
considering all the things the
newspapers write im getting scared too
youre scared
and why
should you be scared
because the papers say
the killer is a crazed moral avenger
and it seems only logic to me that
you catch my drift
l dont know
what there to catch
he only kills
unfaithful wives
youre right barbara
you shouldnt be scared franca
at least as far
as im informed
l dont think that funny
first floriana
then serena and now what
who next
nonsense dont let this get into your head
dont meet trouble halfway
it about time
cant we change the subject
good let talk
about men
it not really worth the risk
dont you think
do you
dont you as well
the husband ruled out
and so is the lover
all in all capuana
we have absolutely nothing
oh well
that the way it is
commissioner
l have checked
and re-checked
l could still arrest the husband
if you think it of any use
for heaven sake
anybody just not the husband
you know
he in the public eye
you see this phone
it hasnt stop ringing since yesterday
many recommendations
some real exquisite ones among them
you have any proof against him
no
then leave him alone
no no proofs
he only thought about politics
and she about love
the unfortunate truth is that were sitting
on a barrel of dynamite my dear capuana
one false move
and we all fry
and to be honest
l find it pleasant to live in this town
and you my friend
same here
but i think there as much rotten
in small towns as there is in big cities
wherever they transfer me
l know what to expect
do you have a plan
no the killer knows
the habits of his victims
so he knows his way around
the rich parts of the town
that where i have to look for him
but be careful
l dont want you to venture
into even higher circles
no not here
please
im scared darling
l dont like this place
it dangerous all alone out here
im begging you
but what are you afraid of my love
you dont think im the killer do you
what are you saying
but why out here in the open
it not easy to find an apartment
and i dont want to go to your place
if it about money
dont worry about it
come on
im begging you let go
but renata
im begging you
it you inspector
dont worry
im not here in an
official capacity mr gastone
l was passing by your house and thought
l might have a chat with gastone
the right hand
of casali
how long have you been working
with the professor
two years ever since i got here
ah very nice
please do come in
thank you
very cozy in here
yes please have a seat
smoke
you were saying
i didnt say anything
ah yes
do you like your work
i sure do
otherwise
l wouldnt do it
as you wouldnt do yours
if you didnt like it
well said
and what do you do
when youre not working
l rarely go out
l take care
of my flowers
a nice place
very well kept
you live alone
you want to know
why im not married
oh no that none
of my business
it lovely here
nice and bright
in here
and what over there
the bathroom and the kitchen
l only have two rooms
it not easy for a man of my profession
to find a woman you know
sooner or later
they find out
about the corpses
and then it over
before it even started
and what is this
it a small photo lab
well this is not
a search
l will go now
do you want
to have a look at it
if you dont mind
i dont
please
i have to tell you something inspector
go on
this might sound absurd
but if you didnt know them
would you think theyre dead
look how beautiful
they are
more beautiful than alive
death cleansed them
no more traces of sin
or human misery
and all thanks to me
that why i love my work
you see three minutes
agostini would have made it faster
very funny
besides im driving slower
when im with you
you know what
you like me
yes but i also like
school these days
and public gatherings
talks with teachers protests collectives
l like collectives too
but only the ones with you
you reactionary
youre a spoiled bourgeois
not even shocking current events
shake you
you mean the maniac
who cares about him
he only after the old timers
youre right
but that also affects us
my parents dont want me
to go out anymore
i have only five minutes
for you
youre talking like your father
youre not a good revolutionary
ill stay as long
as you want
but i didnt come here
to talk about politics
yes
what do you want
youre mistaken
this is the residence of the lawyer santangeli
why did you hang up
was that the guy who always dials
the wrong number
who
i dont know what you mean paolo
you do know what i mean
dont try to make me an idiot
you think i dont know your latest mistress
even though she lives next door
im taking the same liberties as you do
very well
that was plain enough
but we shouldnt forget something
what
we have
a reputation to lose
and with that reputation
our wealth this house and a daughter
are you speaking for me
or for you
for both of us
your private life
doesnt interest me
but i dont want a scandal
it strange this killer
he only after
adulteresses
so what
he might rid you of me
you would like that wouldnt you
no not at this price
please do me a favor
pay another visit to your mother
like you do so often these days
but this time you actually go
you thought about everything
didnt you
in my opinion this solution
is acceptable and elegant
when all this is over
you can come back here without fear
please do as i tell you franca
youre in danger
lilly
lilly
hello daddy
everything okay at school
yes
bye
bye
good afternoon
wonderful flowers
madam
to the envy of my wife
your wife doesnt care about them
how your husband
he doesnt care about anything
he not well
ill see you in the evening
at 6 pm
the usual place
scaredy-cat
no inspector
youre following a wrong path
gastone sure is a strange fella
but harmless
he has this morbid passion
for corpses
he beautifies and photographs them
but that all
l once knew someone
who would smash valuable vases
just so he could fix them again
listen capuana
l know youre desperately trying to catch
the murderer who will surely kill again
but gastone is not your man
how can you be so sure
well i know him very well
gastone is not capable
of committing any act of violence
that why he always wants
to erase every trace of it
professor casali i started my career
in sicily and sardinia
where 2 + 2 = 4
there every murder
has a motive
but what motive is there
for these crimes
l dont know
maybe it the work
of a homosexual
a homosexual
yes out of jealousy
my theory
is supported by the fact
that all the lovers faces
have been erased from the photos
that right
or a betrayed husband
just think about it
he kills two three four
unfaithful wives
and then his own wife
who would suspect him
no
or maybe
an impotent man
impotent men often have a mortal hate
for women they cannot possess
in this case
wed have a huge problem
how should i find an impotent man
with a newspaper ad
l have to go
l promised my wife
to come home for supper
at least this one time
why dont you come to my place
for dinner some time
together with your wife
of course
it would be a pleasure
mine too as soon as this is over
it already late
l must go
oh please
it better that way
my love
what that you scared me
youre home so late
youve become unbearable
when you tried to commit suicide
because of me as you claimed
you could at least have done a decent job
and gone to hell
instead of staying here
ruining my life
will i see you in the garden afterwards
why not
mother suffers from insomnia
but shell take her pills
and 5 minutes later
she fast asleep
that it kids your parents dont
want you to come home so late
the same old story
totally exaggerated
im sorry
l made a promise to your parents
all because
of that jerk
why doesnt he screw instead of killing
right on he should have group sex
ill take you home
yes alright
good night
good night
good night
good night kids
bye
im sorry it not my fault
see you
good night
bye
bye see you
my best to your mother
alright then
at half past ten in the garden
okay
yes or no and dont think about it
you know it yes
since day one
isnt that your neighbor
her husband a cripple
and has to go on crutches
she has a lover
they say
and not the first one
at least she has the good taste
not to bring him to her house
will you walk me to the gate
sure
bye
bye
see you tomorrow
lilly
where are you
lilly
make sure you get all the details
get a wide shot from every angle
and lots of closeups
hello casali
good morning inspector
the usual photos were left

an accident id say
me too
search all his papers
yes
always the same
technique
is there any evidence
of a struggle
yes sure
she was taken by surprise
and tried desperately to resist
just like the others
three murders
in a very short time
the similar techniques
point to the same killer
all killings
seem to be unmotivated
the work of the police
in a case like

with more force
spike harder bravo
move to the net

the milan-brenner express
is now arriving at track 2
the express from calabria

the express from calabria
is running 40 minutes late
dead woman
in the sleeping car
the maniac
has killed again
city in fear
panic spreads
everybody sees the killer
police receives numerous calls
a storm of anonymous letters
will the killer strike again
l preferred to come here
on my own free will
my daughter
is still in shock
unfortunately she heard it on the radio
that her mother was killed
just like the others
i understand
thank you
im at your disposal
what do you want to know
youre a lawyer
you know that i have to ask you
some unpleasant questions
naturally inspector
please treat me
like everybody else
therell be fewer misunderstandings
if were frank
your first question
might be
mr santangeli
did you get on that train
indeed that it
l didnt get on
l just saw her
at the very last moment
franca was standing
by the window
l barely managed
to reach for her hand
and to wish her
a good trip
did you see anybody you know
at the station
but who could tell
if someone doesnt intend to find an alibi
he wont pay attention
no
besides
i dont have a motive
there no life insurance
no inheritance
and i dont even
use a razor to shave
but you did forget
an important motive
the revenge
of a betrayed husband
youre an old man
my dear inspector
we live in different times now
franca cheated on me and i knew about it
and my wife knew
that im unfaithful too
we live in a time
where married couples
are looking for other couples
with newspaper ads
to swap wives
do you find that cynical
where were you after your wife departed
after the departure
of the train
please treat me like everybody else
dont beat about the bush
why dont you ask me where were you
when your wife was murdered
alright
then ill ask
what you wanted to be asked
where were you
when your wife was murdered
you should ask that
your commissioner
i was killing him
at the hunt club
in a bridge tournament
of course
i guess were done
with the interview arent we
that right
you can go
you want me to say it again
i didnt call him in
he came
on his own accord
i want to be frank
with you capuana
weve known each other for a long time
that why i dont blame you
but get into your head
that the fuse is burning
this could blow us to pieces
damn it
the lawyer wasnt at the club
i know what im doing
i cant explain my motives
to you
you better go and find out
who his new mistress is
and dont cause me
any more problems
you want me to leave so you can
pass the case on to someone else
dont be ridiculous
you cant give up now
i know it a dirty story
youre the chief of the
criminal investigation division
and you have
my utmost trust
whenever i think
i found the answer
there still
something missing
dont lose heart
and continue your investigation
this damn maniac
must make a mistake some day
maybe
but he hasnt made
the slightest mistake yet
without a doubt he very intelligent
sure
he appointed himself the moral avenger
of the upper class
he knows
all their secrets
all their lovers
and where they meet
he must be one of them
that all we know
that not enough capuana
we have to act faster
we have to catch him quick
if we dont want to get fried
goodbye madam
no
giannina
youre not happy
but you think you are
ah yes
in fact youre scared
scared of a man who threatening you
what man
your husband giannina
for your own good
dont drive him too far
cut it out mom
your husband renata
he trusted you
but now he in doubt
he gone away or pretends he is
in any case youre alone tonight
and without protection
stay here my dear
dont go home
you live too isolated
mom your cards
are getting on my nerves
l see it perfectly clear
renata loves the danger
just like me
after all it the danger
that gives an adventure its flavor
hello
hi
mauro
is he gone
yes he left yesterday
arent you in the mood
for a little night stroll
why dont you
come over
i already told you i cant relax there
someone might see us
but who could possibly
see you
and if your husband
walks in all of a sudden
no he not the type
for surprises
im expecting you dear
come on over
im dying to
make love to you
come on dont keep me in suspense
i want you too
see you soon
renata
renata it me
open the door
renata
youre leaving so early
i just came home
youve been up
all night
yes
i understand
another murder
who is it this time
here read it
oh my god
renata too
it horrible
now there are five
did you read this
theyre attacking the police
i read it
and others will follow
next theyll claim
were on the side of the opposition
why are they making
a political affair out of this
because two of the husbands
are in politics
and the scandal
hurts them
why wont you
just quit all this darling
my father offered you
a good position in his firm
let them go to hell
why dont you accept his offer
you know that not for me
im a cop
what would i do
among refrigerators
yes
when i was transferred here some years ago
i thought i had found some peace
remember
a lovely town
surrounded by green
a low crime rate
only a few
small-time crooks
and then suddenly within two months
the apocalypse
hello capuana speaking
what
and the address sergeant
okay ill come right away
what happened
the maniac called us
maybe we got him
open up
in the name of the law
in the name of the law
open up
dont shoot im unarmed
inside
why did you call us
why
im tired of killing
you see
this is my work
all these whores
wanna know why i did it
in the presence of a magistrate
at the station
but of course
im the man
you were looking for
tell me the truth
l gave you a hard fight
if i hadnt turned myself in
you would have never caught me
l have a diabolic mind
do you know
how i chose my victims
take him away
dont give yourself credit
you never would have
found me on your own
he a publicity seeker
maybe it appears so
but i set the whole thing up
and i hope
it works out
i chose someone who is
the exact opposite of the killer
hoping the real one will fall for it
isnt that right
right if we credit
the murders to a half-wit
the killer feels insulted
and will come out of his hiding
yes this is an
interesting experiment
but the magistrate
it will take him a few days
to discover that he can only
charge the man with misrepresentation
meanwhile i hope that
the culprit gives himself away
alright capuana
i hope so too
i just want you
to be very careful
because of the killer
no because of the press
theyre waiting downstairs
for the usual press conference
good luck in the lion den
yeah yeah
but this time
itll be different
where is the monster now
with the magistrate
what his name
it all on the photos
we gave you
what did he say when he was arrested
that he tired of killing
the he boasted
with his diabolical mind
are you sure
he the culprit
this is what we found in his house
a pair of gloves
a hat a knife
and a black mask
you have
any other proof
of course we also recapitulated
his life during the last few months
but the preliminary arrest
can only be prolonged for two days
i want to make one thing clear
this was not an arrest
and no arrest warrant
has been issued
meaning what
as of now he only a witness
he turned himself in
what your opinion
im not the magistrate
he has to make the decisions
that would be all
gentlemen
thank you
be seeing you soon
there something
shady about this
the maniac was captured
the police storms
a house in the outskirts
finds a knife gloves
and the killer mask
the man confessed
capuana
i am the man you think
you have captured
who
dont be any stupider than you are
excuse me i dont understand
oh really
who are you
you understand very well
im sorry but
i cant give you
my name
im the one
you call the maniac
instead of the
moral avenger
the man you arrested
is just a pathetic moron
if you know that and conceal it
youre a fraud
if you dont know that
youre even stupider than him
in any case
youre totally incapable
why should i believe you
the fact that youre calling me
proves that youre the idiot
youre the one

french industrialist

the italian husband

-----NewMovie-----
﻿
he lying
ill kill him
he wanted me too
id do it again and again and again
men i hate the whole breed
never mind the speeches let me alone
he made me do it
no have nothing to say
dont be so serious judge
it my funeral
keeping me healthy to kill me
im famous bavian
the papers all hate me dont they
no im not sorry
one week more
six days five days
it goes fast doesnt it
did you mail my letter to paul bavian
three more days one for each man
why doesnt he come
why doesnt he come
why doesnt he come
stop it stop it stop it
but doctor if you were trying to tell me
ruth rogen insane youre too late
the courts have held otherwise
i am not
i am telling you she might be the cause
of other people going insane
what do you mean
warden have you ever noticed
that when a criminal is executed
for some unusual crime
there is frequently an epidemic
of similar crimes
sure
a lot of imitators
i wonder
i wonder if they are imitators
perhaps their will has been subdued
now doctor just because you are
supposed to have psychic powers
just a moment please
perhaps theyve been possessed
by another personality
a powerful and malignant personality
without well without a body of its own
like ruth rogen
precisely
like ruth rogen will be tomorrow
well that a very interesting theory
doctor if you can prove it
im not trying to convince you warden
i only want you help
well what do you want of her body
after the execution
ive been experimenting lately
with mitogenic rays
what are they
ultraviolet rays given off by the body
now if my experiments are correct
i might be able to prevent her personality
from escaping after death
and committing other crime
but why rogen
she a proper remarkable subject
so notorious a criminal should
i imagine have quite a number
of what you would call imitators
now here my point warden
if there are no similar crimes committed
well i should at least have negative proof
that my theory is correct
hmm
seems sort of creepy when you think of it
well well see what we can do
have to get her permission of course
naturally
she rather difficult to handle
youd better let me do most of the talking
all right
come on
let me alone let me alone i tell you
cant i have any peace
get out get out of here
im sorry
i thought it might interest you
nothing going to interest me
except a message from the governor
and i wont get that
no
im afraid you wont
you have nothing to
lose by doing what i ask
no and nothing to gain
listen to me my body my own
the law gives me that much
take my body away
and then guarantee i can have it forever
funny isnt it
you do the laughing
im offering you a chance
to do something for humanity
humanity
there only one of them
i want to do anything for
just one
i wrote for him to come here
but he too smart
the doctor may be giving you
a chance for even that
i suppose he can bring me back
after im dead
no no no i didnt say that im
well you cant tell what hell do
dr houston is one of
the world greatest psychologists
he too modest to tell you everything
if i thought i could come back
and walk around and talk
if i could use my hands
if i could use my hands
just for a few minutes
you have nothing to lose ruth
no i have nothing to lose
nothing to lose
ill send you a paper to sign
here
been to see her in jail mr bavian
no
well look
be careful
dont do that
youre a heartless man mr bavian
i wouldnt treat a dog
the way you treated her
not that it any of my business
it certainly isnt
just the same
i know what goes on in my house
and if any man treated me
the way you treated her
id have shotten him
stop it youve been drinking
what if i have
im thinking of that poor girl
she waiting there waiting in jail
to the death chair waiting for them
to come and fetch her
go to bed youll sleep it off
youre no gentleman
oh there are all of my pets out again
oh
why dont you clean the transom
once in a while
then you can see more clearly
well i just looked in because i thought
why you might have been in bed
what do you want
there a letter for you
why it been here the whole afternoon
it from the poor creature
how do you know
the handwriting
this is a lie
her finger marks were found on his throat
she must be crazy
why should i tell the police
she may be crazy but youre not
what do you mean
youre not going to get within reach
of those hands of hers are ya dearie
roma

better alone for a while grant
well that over

it was staged grant
he said john was murdered
by hammond

it was john talking and
hammond was with him
when he died

ill be there
yes
good bye
thank you
now the contact is completed
as you know
spirit communication
may take any one of many forms
levitation
moving lights voices
raps materialization
or automatic writing
in automatic writing
the medium himself
while in a trance
writes the message
consequently this method
may be open to question
independent writing
the messages received
independently of the medium
consequently tonight
we will experiment
by this means
but i warn you again
i promise you nothing
the invisible
that you wish to hear from
may not be able to reach me
but if i succeed
my reward lies in the knowledge
that i have been of service
to a gracious lady
also i feel very flattered
that so eminent a scientist
such as dr houston
would be present
at a seance conducted by
someone with a person
as myself
i would like to have a handkerchief
from you if you please
one of yours will do
hm
thank you
it will eliminate any idea of trickery
if youll excuse me a moment
i want to light the incense

good enough to turn out
the overhead lights

sorry sally
what the rush sam
security breach
everybody in the conference room in 0
nero franks maltese national
over the weekend he tried to board
an oceanic airlines flight
from heathrow to chicago
alarms went off when franks
presented his passport
it didnt have the new digital watermark
franks tried to run
mi5 thought he was a suicide
bomber and took him out take a look
nero franks was a
scientist with no priors
working for a german chemical outfit
his specialty was
combustible gas munitions
the brits and the germans
are still looking
for a possible terrorist connection
but no joy so far
so here the issue for us people
now our enemies know
they cant forge visas
that means theyll be looking
for ways to get real ones
the kind you hand out every day
were working with all the british security
agenciesbut theyre stretched really thin
budget cuts plus they have
homegrown terrorists to worry about
were not saying that u hv
to give the 3rd degree
90% of our applicants
are straightforward
it the remaining 0%
that i lose sleep over
any app that tweaks u the
wrong waytake it straight 2 kate
she excelled at this work in washington
what sam really means is
youll need someone to blame
if the wrong guy gets through
so use me
what im really interested in
is anyone with scientific expertise
specialists in chemicals or gases
any questions
all right gang back to work
that fine madam
your visa will be ready tomorrow
she never seen the ball drop
in times square on new year eve
have a good stay
in the united states sister
thank you sir
so do you promise to watch me
when im on american idol
oh absolutely
what
have a good stay
thank you very much bye-bye
dr balan good afternoon
i was told my paperwork is in order
this wont take long
romanian citizen
you have listed a medical conference
as the reason
for visiting the united states
yes
this conference is for pediatricians
youre a general practitioner
i work in a clinic
for newly arrived immigrants
many of my patients are children
dr balan it also says that you consult
for vicker pharmaceuticals
im curious why we dont have
a letter from them
ive only been there a few months
is there a problem
i certainly hope not
let me see this file
im not done with my review
a word
you dont think it strange that a gp
who also happens to be a researcher
wants to attend a pediatrics conference
there nothing odd about moonlighting
as a consultant to make a few extra bucks
besides naomi already did
the background check
balan fine
ill be the judge of that
look i know you were a high-flyer in dc
i am not here on vacation
even when it slow were not
processing people fast enough
were seriously understaffed
so when paperwork gets held up by security
people start missing flights
and im the one that has to deal
with their complaints
unless you wanna suffer
the ambassador wrath
im doing my job bill
we all are
we have a problem
a new security expert
from washington
her name is kate abbott
she knows about vicker
so no visa
she trouble im telling you
ill take care of her
this way please
sweet of you to stop in
there something you need to see
ill have it done tomorrow
lisa
hey
im so sorry
it okay i saved us
a bottle of bubbles
oh youre the best
so how did it go
would you believe i sold every damn one
no
yes
but i saved those for you
i know you have a thing
for the underworld
thank you
oh wow
so all work and no play huh
it complicated
is everything a state secret with you
it so beautiful
hello
hi naomi it kate
im so sorry it so late
it okay is something wrong
you remember a guy
you processed a while ago
sri lankan researcher
by the name of fazli sameer
uh yeah i was checking him out
when bill pulled the file
why
he said i had too much on my plate
and hed handle it
okay all right thanks so much bye
actually dr balan
did ask me for a reference
request slipped through the cracks
ill get my secretary
to draft one today
oh would it be possible to see
dr balan security clearance
what this really about
i just thought since i was here itd be
about that
if you were even remotely familiar
with the british defense ministry
standards on secrecy
were on the same side here
you need to present a proper written
authorization from the home office
to even inquire
about security clearances
dr perry i
it time for you to leave
get inspector anderson for me please
hey howie
hey sweetie what up
listen i need the list
of this month visa files
yeah
there no authorization
oh parker probably forgot to call
could you remind him
yes oh
bye
bye bye-bye
you wanted to see me
miss abbott i believe you know
inspector paul anderson
from counter terrorism command
good morning
why are you making inquiries
into the security status
of a british resident dr emil balan
he applied for a visa to come
to the united states
so you took it upon yourself to go to
his workplace and interrogate his superior
rather than contacting my office
dr balan needs his visa today
i just thought it would be faster
not to go through proper channels
what this about paul
the director perry
contacted me personally
to complain that ms abbott had been
making unauthorized inquiries
then he called his friend
the home secretary
who asked me
if you have issued the visa
no i havent
is there a problem
ambassador crane
inspector sorry im late
i didnt know you were joining us
i didnt either
the home secretary just called
so what the problem
i cant discuss the details
of an ongoing investigation
were talking about a medical professional
with serious political connections
is this really a matter
of national security
sam
it her call im standing by it
ill inform the home secretary
accordingly
but let me tell you something about balan
that you probably dont know
a few years ago
his wife applied for a visa
for emergency medical treatment
in the united states
she died because some bureaucrat
kept asking for one more piece of paper
under the circumstances
you might consider showing her widower
a little compassion ms abbott
ambassador
congratulations youre already making
enemies in high places
keep it up
sam get control of this situation
you okay
yeah

what are you hearing sally
a restaurant blew
the place looks like a killing zone
gas made the explosion
according to first responders
radio chatter it was a bomb
im working on getting
security video feeds
where was the hit
just a few blocks away
do we have anyone in the area
the visa crew took bill
to lunch at gaston
christ waring lane
oh god
american embassy
all right sir
how long until this is fully out
hours
how many
four of yours two waiters
saleswoman from the glassware shop
and five passersby
and more than a dozen wounded
the blast originated
where your people were seated
has anyone claimed responsibility
no
the bomb took out most of the security
cameras near the restaurant
dont know how much
of the feed well recover
is that all of em
we found this in the shop
abbott must have been in there
when the bomb went off
do you think she dead
we cant find her
joyce robert alvin naomi
theyre all dead
oh my god
bill talbot was supposed to be
at that restaurant
he stayed behind
to take a secure link call
if he was running late
he should be somewhere
between the embassy and the restaurant
get a lock on the trackers
on bill and kate ids right now
okay that was the search team
there still no sign of abbott
so what do we know about her
only child born and raised in montana
parents are deceased
stanford university
then a two-year scholarship for graduate
studies at the university of london
she applied to the state department
scored high enough to get into
the bureau of diplomatic security
she single-handedly unraveled a plot
to bomb the american embassy in 20
okay so she knows the city
and she good at her job
tell me something i dont know
well she better than good
london considered a senior posting
she speaks four languages three of them
being russian arabic and mandarin
wait she cia
we dont know
okay until proven otherwise
we assume abbott is alive
that makes her a material witness
and quite possibly a suspect
get her details out to the police
mi5 the media
if she wandering around injured
surely a security camera will pick her up
no shell know better than that
but put her friends especially
that photographer lisa carr
under surveillance
abbott might reach out to her
i had a lock on kate locator
but the signal keeps breaking up
kate knows were tracking
her embassy id
she following protocol
heading for the safe zone in the park
talbot already there
ill be there in two minutes

where
somewhere where there a lot of people
st pancras station
by the christmas market two hours
what the composition of the gas
a precise mixture of hydrogen
methane and fluorine
the volume in new york
will be four times greater
so will the results
made to the exact specifications
necessary to trigger this device
im curious why not use
a detonator in new york
at major events
the police carry
beeper-size radiation detectors
there bomb-sniffing dogs
hazmat units
if there any sign of an alert
even a false alarm
the first thing the authorities do
is kill all communications
jam radio frequencies
shut down all cell phone towers
then we have the counter snipers
placed in a 500-meter radius
however
i shall be firing
outside their perimeter
soon my friend
so now there only the girl
just make sure my shipment
gets to new york that all i ask
the large gas explosion
ripped through the housing estate
in tower hamlets
thanks
what have you got for me maureen
the president is demanding answers
i just spoke with the british home
secretary they dont have her do we
abbott tracker was damaged in the blast
we lost her signal for the moment
but even if we get it back
the brits have snatch teams ready to go
if i try to make a move on abbott
and happen to get lucky on her location
i lead her right to anderson
sam she a liability
kate had nothing to do
with bill murder
go ahead
um this morning kate took
the monthly visa list
the flash drive contains
all of the background checks
and references on the applicants
if we find there been
a possible terrorist breach
that usually the first place we look
she said youd okayed it
did you
no
what about the backup systems
five files were permanently
deleted earlier today
the entry log shows
that it was abbott id
it gets worse
we checked the security log
abbott has been working a lot of nights
when there no one around
it possible that she created documents
to get somebody into the country
and then erased the records
to cover herself
may i remind you that just five
weeks ago you sent her over here
with glowing recommendations
because we needed the best
if i recall correctly
she was one of your protegees
although im sure youll deny that now
i was skeptical at first
but it turns out you were right
she an extraordinary asset
yeah just not for us
that complete bullshit
and deep in your scared little souls
you all know it
we dont assume the worst
of our best people
and we damn sure dont sell them out
at the first sign of trouble
but most of all
we dont forget motivation
and kate is sterling
she lost some
of her best friends on 9/
then why is she still running
she on the move
where kate
the last time we got a signal
leicester square
and that was 0 minutes ago
it was barely registering
jesus you look how i feel
how are you holding up
were monitoring
anderson communications
his people are looking hard
but in all the wrong places
how did it go upstairs
they want me to try to bring in kate
use anderson if i have to
from anderson forensic lab
dont ask how i got it
the bomb has traces of chromium
we havent seen that since
paris two years ago
the watchmaker
or whatever he calls himself these days
whoever wanted the visa crew dead
paid for the best operator in the business
he had so much reconstructive surgery
no one knows what the hell he looks like
she in st pancras station
ill have to take the chance
and where abbott friend
she just turned off the euston road
into st pancras station
all right stay with her im on my way
please allow
passengers off the train first
please allow passengers
off the train first
for your safety and security
cctv is in operation in every station
code lucifer repeat code lucifer
lisa
suspected suicide bomber
at northeast entrance
okay move move move move move
what the matter
did you bring the money
did you bring it
kate youve got to tell me something
stay here dont move
until someone tells you to
what
kate kate
move move
move move move abbott
you had your chance to help me sam
make sure he doesnt follow us
abbott
there no way out abbott
it a dead end
this way sir
damn it
it this way
abbott
abbott stop
stop
stop
follow her
abbott
no this way
i think she went this way
shit shit
shit
shit
we can seal them off from the street
what you think she gonna take
an officially marked tourist exit
there are hundreds
of other ways out of here
she could be anywhere
what
jesus
fucking technology
bitch
sam
oh come on
you know i didnt do any of this
gotcha
you sure it was the same guy you saw
after the restaurant explosion
yes and he was in the park
after bill tried to kill me
so he could have followed you here
give me your id
we dont need anybody else tracking you
you think he tracked me all this time
sam who is he
his code name is the watchmaker
he one of the most wanted
assassins in the world
you doing okay
how did you know i would come here
i didnt
i just came looking for answers
what are we doing with our lives
i put everything into this
and what am i now a suspect a target
maybe both
were doing this because
we believe in that old-fashioned idea
of country right
or at least protecting
our fellow citizens
our friends
right now im doing it
to protect my own hide
that good thinking
what that
it the flash drive i got from howie
last month we processed
over 600 visa applications
and bill personally intervened in five
of those cases including balan
now for each applicant he used
a different member of the visa team
and when i started asking questions
he ignored me slammed them through
so what the connection
between the applicants
i dont know yet
but we do know balan is an expert
in combustible gases
maybe bill had the answer
bill said something strange in the park
now i have no choice
he must have kept some information
about the people he let in
a little leverage in case he needed it
who puts a padlock on a bedroom door
hello my lovely
god
is this bill son
yeah
johnny died in afghanistan
something about this
just doesnt add up
it like bill was expecting him to walk
through the door at any minute
take it apart
everything
look at this
hi dad im doing okay
hope you are too
itll be christmas soon
wish we could be together
johnny been alive all this time
do you think there a chance
i doubt it look at his eyes
he swimming in dope
someone kept him alive for as long
as possible to get this footage
but how did they know it was
bill son or who bill was
they must have someone
with access to army records
doesnt have to be a major player
a guy inputting data could be enough
once they knew it was bill
they threatened to kill his son
if he didnt give them what they wanted
which makes bill actions understandable
but not excusable
because once bill got his people into
the states it was only a matter of time
before he eliminated everyone
who handled the paperwork
then he got the bastard
who murdered them to come after me
the watchmaker would never deal
with low-level guys like bill
his business is
with whoever had bill son
you said there were four others
besides balan
yeah and every single one
of them is in america
we need to move now
ill get archer to meet us out front
come on come on come on
what wrong
let get the hell out of here
sam
kate
kate
sally
kate
is sam still alive
barely
he pretty badly hurt kate
hold on anderson on the scene
he coming on the line with crane
madam ambassador
im at bill talbot apartment
sam parker been critically injured
jesus
witnesses saw abbott running from
the scene and we found her embassy id
where is she now
we dont know
if you get her in your sights
do not hesitate do you understand
yes i do
the longer she lives
the more people die
kate
im here
im so sorry
they think you tried to kill him
what that insane
i need to get into the embassy
to the vault
the building on total lockdown
there no other way
kate listen to me
the place is crawling with marines
you know im innocent
and i know im right about this plot
you have to get me in sally
im at the north roll-up door
im buzzing you in now
im shutting down the cameras
in the stairwell and the vault
in and out as fast as you can
attention security breach
at basement level
oh god no
there a terrorist
headed for the states
emil balan he traveling
on a romanian passport
oceanic airlines flight 428
out of heathrow to jfk
they have to stop him sally
we missed her she got herself a new
passport and then wasted the hard drive
the name she used the passport number
theyre gone she could be anyone
get abbott picture to security
at all london airports and train stations
yes yes yes what is it
the purpose of your visit doctor
medical conference
there still time to stop balan
madam ambassador if you act now
no dont you see what abbott doing
she is trying to get us to chase
a shadow instead of her
youre supposed to have left
for new york
im not sure im going
what the hell are you talking about
i found your reaction
to that little explosion quite instructive
the way your eyes lit up
the greed i saw in them
fortunes are made
when there blood on the streets
and very soon there gonna be
a great deal of blood
on the streets of new york wont there
just as there was after 9/
however when the new york
exchanges reopened
people who bet against the market
made a fortune
this isnt an act of terror
or a bold political statement
balan may wish to avenge
his wife death
but for you
it just about making money
$00 billion is in play i would say
the word just doesnt quite fit
if i stay home you wont make a penny
what do you want
half
half of your short-selling profits
on the new york exchanges
the day they reopen for trade simple
is the girl dead
very
for security reasons
please do not leave baggage unattended
baggage left unattended will be removed
and may be destroyed
ill grab these too
yeah got it
there you go thanks
thank you
thank you
your flight boards in 5 minutes

to shut that down for landing

abbott has no history there
no friends to help her

it safer to take the eurostar

is a security officer and a serious threat

he just wouldnt go away
one night

a little physical and--
and you turned into a werewolf
out of anger scott

the werewolf out of anger
right in front of
his beady little eyes
was he scared
scared
he lost control
of his bodily functions
ah i wish i couldve seen that
it wasnt a very
nice thing to do

after that he never bothered
your mother and me

the most frightened that night

still an unsung hero
waiting for my ship
to come to shore
i stood empty handed
like a seagull stranded
watching all the other
seagulls soar
i was slowly losing hope
twisting frayed ends
of the rope
in a suicidal fantasy
i was going to extremes
losing sight of all my dreams
again
i never thought id win
i was blinded by the pain
running wild
through the rain
in a parody of ecstasy
i was inches from the edge
fingers clinging
to the ledge again
i never thought id win
win in the end
im gonna win in the end
win in the end
im gonna win in the end

than they think
they can force me
to the brink again

behind the mask

is what youll get from me
i am stronger
than they think
they can force me
to the brink again
but now i know ill win

get back off the court
funny how sometimes life
just changes over night
magically everything you do
turns out so right
just like that
you pull rabbits
out of your hat
youve got the charm that
even wizards cant explain
how to make rainbows
from a single drop of rain
who can say
it a trick
you learn how to play
when youre shooting for the
moon and finally make it
guess a lucky star
is shining on you
the candle on the cake
is yours so take it
make another wish
it sure to come
let blow out of here
drop dead
tell me i can do it too
the candle on the cake
is yours so take it
make another wish
it sure to come true
you say there
really nothing to it
maybe i can do it too

oh good morning
mr wilbanks
good morning
did you happen
to get my note
yes i got your note
every time i put my hand
in my pocket i got your note
now you listen to me steven
im not interested in your
theories on ratings
and im certainly not interested
in doing a show called
abraham lincoln doctor dog
whatever that is
what is it
uh well sir
it very interesting
you see we had a guest speaker
from our school last night
a mr ez potter
youve probably heard of him
ez potter
yes sir
he from up north
up north
where up north
tulare
tulare
yeah
he got a surefire approach
for making a top-rated tv show
he does
yes sir and it
very logical too
you see
it been historically proven
that the american people
have always preferred stories
about number one abe lincoln;
number two doctors;
and number three dogs
so the most popular and
highest rated show of all
would be a show about
abe lincoln doctor dog
and that is the kind of a show
your tv friend from tulare
wants me to make
well actually he not
in tv sir he in radio
radio
yes sir they dont have
a tv station up there
they dont
abraham lincoln
doctor dog
yeah
title kinda long but
it sounds like a good idea
wait in the car
oh
now you listen to me post
you get this straight
your job here
is to deliver the mail
and that is all you are to do
is to deliver the mail
i am not interested
in your quacky theories
that come from your
quacky teachers that teach
in your quacky night school
yes sir but
actually in this case
it wasnt a teacher
i know what he was
he was a radio man from tulare
anything important jen
oh yes sir
mr crampton called
from new york
he did
well why didnt you
tell me that
when the president
of the network calls
you dont let me stand around
talking about abraham lincoln
dog doctor
uh abe lincoln
doctor dog sir
there a difference
i dont care what it is
how long ago did he call
about an hour ago

shouldve called me at home
well i did
but you werent there
your wife said you were
out on some deliveries
oh y-ye-deliveries yeah

necessary to call him back

slipping this to crampton
if you get a chance
uh no i cant do that if the
boss ever caught me passin one
of your notes to the chief--
grating sound
dont worry about wilbanks
i got somethin big goin
it our chance to put the
network on top and i can prove
it to mr crampton with this
our network on top
laughing snorting
forget it
guess i was mistaken youre
just another one of those
wait a minute
another one of those what
one of those who has somethin
against young people
i never said that
hey what wrong
with a young man
getting ahead anyway
i mean didnt william pitt
become prime minister
of england at 24
and what about
alexander hamilton
you know
he signed the declaration
of independence at 9
look at alexander the great
why how old was he when
he conquered macedonia
i forget
and louis xiv
the greatest ruler
france ever had
you know he became king
at the age of four
four
yeah there was even
a british king who took over
when he was nine months old
i can go all through history
and show you people that became
great leaders at early ages
huh yeah but what that
got to do with--
hey here he comes
now i know youll find
the right time to slip it
to mr crampton
morning mr wilbanks
yes morning morning
have a nice trip
what do you mean
have a nice trip
im only going
to the airport
well have a nice trip
to the airport
something must be wrong
wilbanks were always
third in the ratings
which would be all right but
there are only three networks
we come up
with loser after loser
disaster after disaster
but chief ive been through
47 pilot films this year--
well maybe it your staff
have you got
experienced people
well experience is hard
to come by chief
all youve got
available to you today
are a lot of young kids
running around
trying to tell you how
to run your business
speaking of kids telling you
how to run your business
this is for you mr crampton
sighs
is that from steven post
why would you bother the chief
with a thing like that
isnt it bad enough
that im bothered by him
he says he got a foolproof
method of determining
the top-rated programs
hmm he ambitious
he rated all
of last night shows
check with
the overnight ratings
youll see im right
dont pay any attention
to that kid chief
hell drive you nuts
he 2 years old
and he thinks he should
be running the network
well i dont think age has
anything to do with it boss
i didnt ask you
what wrong with a young man
running the network
look at william pitt
he was only 24 and he was
president of england
and look at alexander the great
how old was he when he conquered
macedonia
how would i know
just drive the car
yeah and look at all
them little kids that was kings
of all them different countries
like this little kid
that was only four years old
and he was king of france
and there one kid--
he was the king of england
he was only nine months
nine months  a person
became king of england
at nine months
i dont remember
anything about that
you dont
laughing snorting
tell him
to drive the car
drive the car
you rated every show
exactly like our rating service
howd you do that young man
i guess i just have an instinct
for what people like sir
oh instinct my foot
he got an instinct for
getting people in trouble
just a minute wilbanks
you cant listen
to a lot of young punks
francis
im surprised he not
out demonstrating
francis
im out here to replace
some shows that--
well theyre
not doin too well
how would you like to look
at some new films with me
gee sir id be honored
that carrying it too far
but i think i could do a lot
better if i took them home
you see my powers
of concentration are
much stronger that way
wilbanks
never mind your powers
of concentration
no film leaves this studio
that company policy
no he right just be
in our viewing room at 600
francis well see how good
the boy really is
nervous chuckle
crampton

it encouraging
wilbanks
yeah i think were
on the right track
what was that

seem to be himself
he has no energy

he even stopped
watching tv
oh he probably just got a hold
of some bad bananas
or something
bananas  would they

bad ones they would
hmm

indeed a brain food
doorbell ringing
oh hi jen
hello vasco da gama
what
oh you know
he was the one who
discovered the west indies
he was a discoverer
you know discoverers

locked in the basement
i-i didnt say anything
about a mad scientist
i want my chimp

talking about
i know steve
look they never
listened to me jen

want to marry a mail boy
i kidded myself but that

my boss thinks the chimp

pretty funny huh
snorting laughing
excuse me
jackhammer stops
yeah  wha-what  yeah
this story about a chimp
selecting our tv shows
what about it
well i mean--
do you believe it
of course i believe it
i knew it all the time
jackhammer running
uh madam
well what do you think
of the rumor of a chimp
selecting our tv shows
a chimp picking tv shows
ridiculous
yes well you know
how those rumors
get started
i know i--
wait a minute
those stations have been
switching and cancelling
my favorite shows for years
maybe a chimp
is behind this mess
oh no madam
it a plot
youre all in on it
no madam
we have nothing to do--
i am so sick and tired
of liking a show
and having it
pulled off the air
or put in another time
madam--
please--
it just drives ya crazy
im getting to the point
where i--
id like to take
the television set
and throw it out the window
the last show i liked
they took it right off the air
the minute i got to like it
off the air
madam--
how do i know what happened
to them  i dont even know
what happened to john
has the man
from the justice department
arrived yet
everybody here sir
good
that good
pounding gavel
gentlemen television
has had problems before
we can work this one out
if we keep cool heads
chattering
keep cool heads
your wilbanks says youve
got a monkey picking programs
and you want us
to keep cool heads
i was delirious
dont give us that
for the past ten years youve
been the third-rated network
suddenly you jump to
number one now there
has to be a reason
you dont have
the personnel to do that
now just a minute clifford
ive plenty of personnel
i have people all--
well i--
oh shut up
mr crampton
weve had a tacit understanding
to share technological advances
now it seems to me that youve
betrayed that understanding
together
we have not
just a minute gentlemen
i must speak
for the justice department
we can have no understandings
between networks
tacit or otherwise
oh come on harry how can
the department call a little
chimpanzee a techni-tech--
so there a chimp
i never--
then there is a chimp
chattering
crampton pounds gavel
gentlemen please
admittedly
there is a chimp
and he does like tv
and it seems he does
prefer the top-rated shows
and he does go to
the refrigerator and get
a beer during the commercials
chattering
gentlemen
if the american people ever
found out that a chimpanzee
was selecting programs
it would be the end
of tv
gentlemen
i have a simple solution
to the whole problem
yes
we must destroy the chimp
oh no no
i cant see it at all
chattering
crampton
oh we cant do that
oh no we couldnt--
oh b--
why wed have those
societies for the prevention
of things all over our backs
that would be the end
of our dog food accounts
gentlemen i think
i have an idea
i hope it better
than the bananas
it practical and humane
you see a chimp belongs in a
jungle not in a network office
we know that dr schmidt
that the problem
what we do is buy the chimp
return him to the jungle
hell be happy the networks
will continue on as usual
and we will be rid of
steven post once and for all
brilliant schmidt
brilliant
bravo  beautiful
that the one
we certainly have the money
and every man
has his price
chattering
so that what they think huh
every man got his price
well dont worry
i dont
steve why dont we
take him and blow this place
forget this whole rat race
i dont want them
to put him in a jungle
jen they cant get to me
i cant be bought
$500000
right
$500000 that a--
that a lot of money
well of course
it a lot of money
how can you even hesitate
well i-i dont know--
post your future
is on the line
now you listen to this
you turn us down
youll never work again
come on
be smart boy
i uh--
i have a problem
a problem
yes sir you see
someone else is involved
and i--
son no more bickering
all right
this will be our final offer
take it or leave it
one million dollars
one million dollars
you did it
you took the money
one million dollars jen
you know what theyre
going to do with him
it was take it
or leave it
besides maybe a chimp
does belong in the jungle
not that one
jen
we can get married now
weve got everything
i thought we did
for a while
now we have nothing
i dont even think
i like you very much anymore
men chattering
soft chittering
mertons  hey boss
what i dont understand
is why do you have to go
well it just too important
a mission to trust
to uh underlings
yeah but all
the other networks are here
oh i get it
you dont trust each other
snorting laughing
well of course we trust
each other where would you get
a ridiculous idea like that

youre kidding
weve never been
more serious
well what am i
supposed to do

stall
dont do anything at all
now do you think
you can handle that
yeah
now what
uh mr wilbanks can i
talk to you for a minute

if if maybe youd reconsider
you know i give you
the million dollars back
and you give me the chimp
well certainly not post

a deal is a deal
and that all
there is to it
of all the nerve
horn honking
brakes squealing
airplane engine starting

well ya got it
snorting laughing
yeah
snorting laughing
it was that simple i gave
mertons the million dollars
and he gave me the chimp
well it must have been tough
to give up all that money
mertons needed it to finance
an expeditionary force to find
wilbanks and the rest of them
laughs
well you know
when you really think about it
it wasnt even my money
it was yours
he your chimp
you mean i gave up

you better wise up
the time is gonna come
when all men will judge
themselves before god
itll be the worst hell
the worst hell on earth
itll make nazi germany
look like a picnic
and you gotta be ready
for that right now
right here right now
just like that
and thats where
were at all the time
whatever is
necessary you do it
when somebody needs to be
killed theres no wrong
you do it and move you on
theres a revolution
coming very soon
youve lit the fuse yourself
were gonna cut and
chop all you fuckers up
la will burn to the ground
los angeles will
burn to the ground
once again youve judged
a reflection of yourselves
we are what you made us
and when your so betrayed
unintelligible
i dont know who
fired the shot
i dont know who
killed the congressman
as far as im
concerned i killed him
you understand
what im saying
i killed him
he had no business coming
i told him not to come
die with a degree of dignity
lay down your
life with dignity
dont lay down
with tears and agony
theres nothing to death
its like mac said
its just stepping
over to another plain
dont be this way
stop these hysterics
this is not the way for
people who are socialistic
communist to die
no way for us to die
we must die
with some dignity
we must die
with some dignity
we will have no choice
now we have some choice
you think their gonna
allow this to be done
allow us to get by with this
unintelligible
it has never been
done before you think
its been done by
every tribe in history
every tribe facing annihilation
in the amazon their
doing it right now
they refuse to bring any
babies into the world
they save every child
that comes into this world
because they dont want to
live in this kind of world
so be patient be patient
i tell you i dont care
how many screams you hear
i dont care how
many anguished cries
death is a million
times preferable
to ten more
days of this life
if you knew what
was ahead of you
if you knew what
was ahead of you
youd be glad to be
stepping over tonight
death death death is common

every time they even make
a mention of the murders

charlie charlie
the the prince
of evil right
very seldom have
i ever seen them mention
the kids that

and the bullets

thats what gets me
bobby and gypsy and i

bobby met charlie
if anybody was
influenced it was him
by me
and so i met charlie
making music is
how i met charlie
when i joined a band
called the milky way
charlie was in it
he was a fine musician
very intense
very vivid from being
locked up all that time
and he was a great lyricist
i was like a
lot of kids my age
looking for god
on a quest for god
stumbling around
taking drugs
kind of like a blind
girl in a forest
let me hit that now
linda i want you to come to
the ranch with me this time
just for a few days
charlie acts from his soul
charlie is the man that
weve all been waiting for
i was living in this
apartment with my dog
and my life was
really routine
id just go to work
go home go shopping
go to work go
home go shopping
and it was really a drag
and then charlie blows in
and he just
changed everything
and i dropped it all
and i just took off
he brought out all
these things in me
that i was just
sticking in slots
when charlie got out
he was 33
hed been locked
up since he was 3
and he was lonely
and this was the first time
he had a group of women
that cared about him
that loved him
and charlie loved those girls
he treated them
with plenty of respect
well i was trying to get
close to charlies girls
its astounding that
charlie even knew dennis
and that we were
all living in this
rock stars mansion
in the first place
but then dennis wised up
and kicked us all out
theres a lot of
acid at the ranch
well of course i went
where the girls went
i followed them
out to the ranch
and tried to integrate
myself with charlie
i came to you with all
the love in my heart
and you slaughtered me man
you slaughtered me
and now i gotta hide
i gotta hide my soul
so you wont kill me
and thats why the
kids have to hide
they come out and
their parents say
shut up get back
inside of yourself
you dont need
to be so bright
cause then weve got
to judge ourselves
they hate to
look at themselves
they hate to look at the
truth in themselves man
they persecute themselves
charlie
this is tex
you can have anything i got
charlie wasnt
the leader at all
he followed us around
and took care of us
are you ready to die
yes i am
then live forever
being accepted by
the family and charlie
was like an answer
an answer to an
unspoken prayer
before his
helter skelter trip
everything was beautiful
all we did was smoke grass
and drop acid
and make love
as much as possible
we were forced to
examine our souls
not privately or secretly
but before charlie
and the entire family
i mean really everything
that everything was for
was for fucking
thats what everything
was for man
to unify ourselves with lsd
i mean if we
werent fucking
we were leading up to it
it was heavy
and if we werent leading
up to it we were fucking
i didnt have any
experience with group sex
but i warmed up to it
the girls kept telling me
that it was my
parents hang ups
that i had to
deprogram myself
from their inhibitions
thats what charlie said the
whole universe was about man
it was all one big fuck
everything was in and out
smoking and
eating and drinking
it was all just one big fuck
were not hippies
were slippies
well the ranch
was fairly isolated
you had to take a back road
from the santa susanna pass
to get there
and it was owned by this
eighty year old
blind guy named george
well charlie never
really believed
that george was
completely blind
he would have
one of the girls
strip down in front
of him from time to time
just to see if there
was some sort of reaction
charlie was always
trying to cultivate george
with the girls you know
to help cook and clean
and make love to him
and of course we helped
out around the ranch
whatever shoveling manure
grooming the horses
whatever it took
to keep up a good front
and make us look
good with george
and for the most part
we got along with
the other ranch hands
goddamn it move you
hippie bastards
except for shorty
freaks
excuse me
charlie tried
but shorty was just
that one ranch hand
that he couldnt
work his magic on
charlie wasnt
looking for attention
which is why he
got so much of it
you people sure
have strange concepts
of boyfriend girlfriend
hi tex
hey tex
sadie
i didnt know what to make
of bobby when i met him
he seemed like a spoiled
super hippy you know
arrogant always trying to use
a power that he
didnt really have
to influence the
rest of the group
whats the problem
last night you said
we were going
swimming this morning
i didnt know you were
going to be in the
barn fucking bobby
look i dont belong
to you tex you got that
i dont belong to anybody
i can do anything i want
and so can you
then why in hell did you bring
me here in the first place
i brought you here
to meet everyone
i brought you here
to meet charlie
charlie charlie
charlie charlie
sometimes our
group lovemaking could
be pretty comical
other times it
was devastating
but thats how
we were growing
we were forming
a bond as a family
and charlie was directing
all these energies
but no one could direct them
charlie wasnt our leader
he didnt want
us hanging on him
like our parents wanted
us to hang onto them
we didnt need them
charlie let us be beautiful
im willing to
die for charlie
because hes me
well we believed
that we were cleansing
ourselves spiritually
the goal was to achieve
an inner harmony
as a group
as an example to
the rest of the world
which we saw as
phony and desperate
we talk this way
about charlie
and people say
people like you
say that were brainwashed
but weve seen
charlie do things
that no human being
has done before
we saw him pick up
a bird in the desert
and breath on it
and bring it back to life
and he said
see i told you
you were perfect
you must always think
of yourself as perfection
and i bought it
and him and the
whole brainwash
man ive been trying to
get a buzz off everybody
nobody has nothing
awwhhh
clem
i need to get high
pack me a bowl
please
that was the last one
oh youve got to be kidding
there isnt any more
no
goddamn it
goddamn it
goddamn it
charlie that sucks
hmmmm yeah
i know some knuckleheads
we can burn
for at least a lid
cmon lets go
whoa whoa now
whoa there
whoa there sadie
hey hey hey
charlie charlie
let go of my leg
whoa whoa hey hey
hey whoa sadie
whoa
hold on now
oh my
youve got some
dirty feet here sadie
lets clean them
there was a love there
a very strong a
very true love there
and if i hadnt felt it
i wouldnt have
followed charlie
a joint
youve got youve got pot
oh thank god
charlie has a joint
would you light this
but until i see all of
you knowing who you are
im going to be
very much what i am
god almighty god
who do you think
sent that tape
maybe it was a practical
joke by some kids
you know charlie has been
sort of an underground hero
for a lot of these kids
wait a minute
i want to show you something
i meant to show you
this the other day
i picked it up at the dark
fantasy comic book store
but look at this
row after row of
charlie faces look at that
and then i realized
that its been all been
leading to right now
you know
its like the family
this is the last time
because now ive
got the perfect body
the one ive wanted all along
the strongest one
the one thats gonna make it
through for the last time
charlie told us
that children were the
real leaders of the family
they were the ones
who lead the way
since we waited on
them they set the pace
jesus christ and his
children were just kids
they were living
free without guilt
and without shame
they were able to
take off their clothes
and lie in the sun
and be one together
we took hundreds of
acid trips together
smoked a lot
of pot together
because we wanted
to be like charlie
because to us
he was living perfection
we wanted to mirror him
we had so much sex
we had every kind of
sex you can imagine
we did things youd
never even think of
its a miracle im not
dead from diseases by now
i had no standards
i would sleep with anybody
anybody i wanted to
or anybody
charlie wanted me to
he would always give
me to the meanest biker
or the craziest whoever
because he said i could
out freak anyone with sex
alright go ahead
and print that
you know when the trial
started for the family
it was really
the milestone
in the death of
the hippie movement
everyone really
thinks patty hearst
martin luther king
died with love
kennedy died
talking about something
he couldnt even understand
some kind of generalized love
and he never
even backed it up
he sucked out
bullshit
love is the only weapon
with which ive got to fight
ive got a hell of a
lot of weapons to fight
ive got my clothes
ive got compasses
i got guns
i got dynamite
ive got a hell
of a lot to fight
ill fight ill fight
unintelligible
i call on you
to stop this now
if you have any
respect at all
are we black proud
socialists or what are we
hey now that reminds
me of something
remember the bookstore
where i got the poster
ok they had both of charlies
albums there both of them
on either vinyl or cds
well he finally
made the record bins
i think its ridiculous
yeah but did you buy them
so terry what was it
like to talk to charlie
you could take him
in very small doses
i mean hed throw
ten things at you
youd be on three
hed be on seven and getting
real physical about it
hed hed bend over
hed pick up a
handful of rocks
and hed toss them
into the air and say
see you can throw it all away
and itll come back to you
were flashing with
divine harmony this morning
i just wrote two songs
while the sun was rising
very very groovy
charlie was not
willing to sell out
to the record producers
which is the first and
most important requirement
before the industry is
willing to handle an artist
do you want
professional sound
maybe something you can use
i suggest you get
in the booth and
hey hey hey hey hey hey
hey hey hey hey hey hey
whats the problem here huh
many musicians say they
dont care about the money
yet they commit themselves
to be at given places
at certain times
and to produce what sells
whether they
believe it or not
charlie didnt
want that success
charlie wanted success
on his own terms
he didnt want
to be imprisoned
i know whats best
for us man i know
do you know anything about
the acoustics in this studio
do you know anything about eq
do you know
anything about mixing
i know about the energy
rays of a free love society
and i know your cold
heartless technology
hasnt defined that yet
amen charlie
but its there
its here
its here dig
like a thought
its a thought
its in a thought
its in a thought
from me to you
i dont have to
take this shit
jerry jerry jerry
jerry jerry cmon man
charlie what
are you doing
you dont go slapping people
well fuck you and
your bullshit studio
hey is that
what you think man
charlie does things his way
he dont conform to the pig
rules of the establishment
so terry you worked in
the studio with charlie
now youre his producer
what what did you think
of him as a musician
as an artist
charlie was at the edge
just the whole sixties scene
la
things kind of built
to a critical mass
and at one point
i actually thought
well maybe there is something
we could do with this but
but the music was
really crap wasnt it
yes the music was crap
were so formal
over here on the bbc
charlie singing
just come and
say you love me
give up your world
cmon you can be
i mean things looked
good for charlie
and everybody was just goofing
with their
head in the clouds
well we gave
up our own birthdays
and renounced our families
charlie didnt allow
any clocks calendars
or anything like
that on the ranch
dennis and bobby
were donating food
cars women whatever
it was always submit
give something to charlie
submit everything you had
submit your ego
if you do not give me
the deed to the ranch
i will throw you on
the rail road track
ahaaaahhhhaaaaahhhhhh
help
save me save me
wed just drop acid
and share out of this big
pile of clothes and costumes
and role play the day away
changing situations
and characters
well youre
all going to be clearing
out of here pretty soon
because george is
getting real tired
of you giving his
ranch a bad name
i dont understand
all you little creeps
charlies not jesus christ
hes not the devil
hes just a little con man
hes spent half his
life in jail goddamn it
well once the bikers and
ex-cons moved onto the ranch
it became a chop shop
for stolen cars
and dune buggies
and shorty began taking
down license plate numbers
now shorty was married
to this black go-go dancer
and that just
burned charlie up
because it went
totally against his
racial philosophies
hey you nigger lover
i heard your wife
takes it up the ass
is that true
well loose lips sink ships
he never said
in so many words
that he was christ
but he would imply
like when hed look at me
and smile and hed say
dont you know who i am
i made love to
charlie last night
yeah
how was it
well it was
cmon
like what was it like
it was
it was great
it was kind of scary
he said all these
really nice things to me
then when he
started to come
he got real tense
and then he climaxed
and i came but
i got all
tense
it was like
i couldnt move my arms
for about a minute at all
i was paralyzed
it was real scary
thats because
your ego was dying
until you give of
yourself completely
and your egos dead
you cant be at the now
see what im saying
but it happens you know
stop this nonsense
dont carry this on any more
youre exciting the children
no no sorrow that its over
im glad its over
hurry hurry my
children hurry
hold it down weve got time
its an act of suicide
commit an act of
revolutionary suicide
we are now at
the end of reason
we are motion itself
we are eternal revolution
if you get behind the
wheel youll kill us both
now give me the keys
give me the keys
ill be back in the morning
no
give them to me
no ill take us home
cmon have a drink

okay
ok
ok
terry was supposed to come in
and record us in our
natural environment
charlie thought a record
deal was coming too
when i showed up
the ranch was in full swing
yeah we had
high expectations
charlie had us clean the
place from top to bottom
we had zuzus
hundreds of
joints were rolled
and the girls
well they prepared this
outstanding vegetarian feast
the food that those
stores threw away
was perfectly good
and we only took the very
best of what was there
charlie singing
oh garbage dump
oh garbage dump
why are you called
a garbage dump
the first day
i came to the ranch
charlie sent me
on a garbage run
he said take
some clean clothes
cause youll get all dirty
and so i went
down to the market
and i hopped in the can
and we went through
everything and got all dirty
and we just took the
best of everything
and we took it and cleaned it
and took the skins off
and cut all the spots out
nobody goes hungry here
you could feed the world
with my garbage dump
you could feed the world
with my garbage dump
charlie im sorry man
im sorry i couldnt make it
i was uh
i was tied up in
a meeting okay
hey hey whoa charlie
charlie ease up man
i never promised
you id be there
i said id come
if i could okay
yeah
its like i tried to
explain to you before ok
the record execs
dont think your stuff
is marketable right now
what i suggest that we do
is well sit on
it until spring
and who knows you
by then you could be
the biggest name since
since jim morrison
whoa whoa whoa whoa
what do you mean
make up my mind
this one little
space in time
where charlie was there
but he wasnt there
little freak
ahhh ahhh
nobody cares about my music
nobody cares
charlie felt betrayed
his album was
going to make us rich
and it was going to spread
his message to the world
i mean it didnt
slow us down
we all the makings
for a great party
when simi came
with the family
she was a virgin
and she was scared
she was scared stiff
charlies about the
hippest guy i ever met
hes going to open doors in
this little brain of yours
so will this
whats that
this is lsd
here take two
weve already dropped
the whole familys
tripping tonight
i havent done any
hard drugs before
its not a hard drug
oh we dont do
any hard drugs
its just its just acid
its not like its heroin
or cocaine or anything
its a groove
i dont know how
what do you mean
you dont know how
its just like going
to the doctors office
stick out your
tongue and say ahhh
say ahhh
well i guess
ive always wondered
what its like
you know to trip
its a groove
say ahhh
ahhh
say ahhh
ahhhh
on her first big
experience with the family
we all tripped on acid
and she plum
tripped out on that
she flipped completely out
we were all
tripping right along
and we balled her brains out
it wasnt rape
she loved it
ahhhh
it its like
she would start fighting
and shes fighting and
scared and fighting
and then shed calm
down and go uhhhh
and then shed realize
what was happening to her
and shed get all
scared and frightened
and and charlie was
sitting in the corner
just directing the operation
yes i knew who
simi sherry was
and i know she was raped
but that was
bobby and charlie
i had nothing to do with that
no she just vanished
never heard from her again
i pray for her now
in my nightly prayers
i just thank god she
got out when she did
or else she might have
ended up in prison too
youve got the nerve
to pray for me
im just as
youre just as
disgusting as i am
its your fault
ive always hated you
you ruined me
you ruined my whole life
all my life
we struggle
i mean we struggle
with ourselves you know
charlie i am not going to
give up all my possessions
and come live with you man
suddenly there
was a lot more talk
about fear and its usefulness
be like an animal
be like a coyote
use fear to help you exist
and to live in the now
well i think i tried to make
myself believe i was a witch
i was yanna the good witch
charlie just shifted gears
we ignored the establishment
and we ignored reality
even more than we before
we just continued on with
the magical mystery tour
charlie got that
from the beatles
he called life
or the flow of life
the magical mystery tour
we were all part if it
one mind one soul
one body
within it and with it
its a total
state of paranoia
its
its man when
youre that aware
you
you can feel everything
you can see
everything that moves
you can hear everything
that makes a sound
you could smell every smell
and when youre that aware
youre at the now
this is when we
started going out
on creepy crawl missions
well not breaking
and entering
creepy crawling
you what
we creepy crawled them
a few of us would drive
into some wealthy
neighborhood
and wed pick a house
and wed steal right from
under these peoples noses
while they slept
you had to be super aware
you had to be aware
of every move you made
well sometimes wed drop acid
to heighten our
awareness level
we creepy crawled probably
fifty houses or more
and we never got caught
not once
you stay positive
you confront your fears
you say yes to your fears
submit to them
and overcome them
no sense makes sense
you cant get caught
if you dont got
thought in your head
sometimes we would steal
from the peoples houses
that we broke into
other times wed just
move the furniture around
to freak them out when
they woke up in the morning
i was a master criminal
i cant believe
youve ever been alive
you dont deserve to live
i hate you
you gotta go too
take me elizabeth
my name is cassandra
you killed me first
charlie developed this game
wed take really strong lsd
and sit in a circle
around an empty chair
charlie called
it the fear chair
wed stare at this chair
while charlie spoke
he told us to imagine
a rich establishment pig
sitting in the chair
now its the pigs
trial hed say
and wed stare at
this imaginary person
and project his fear
right back at him
keeping him immobilized
with his own projected fear
keep judging
yourselves in charlie
but dont look in the mirror
i dont remember exactly when
my mind crossed over from
reality to imagination
but there was no escaping it
things seemed so
doom-laden that summer
everything that charlie
preached seemed like
absolute divine driven truth
and charlie wasnt
preaching about death
of the ego anymore
now he meant violent death
physical death
and when he said death is
beautiful he meant it
death is beautiful
because it its what
people feared the most
death is merely
an illusion anyway
because the infinite
soul can never die
if youre not dead
you will be soon
tex was in bad shape
charlie had told us all
we had to cease to exist
but tex never could
free the mind
and your ass is
bound to follow
its like he wanted it
both ways you know
one minute hed be
bad mouthing charlie
and the next minute
hed be saying shit like
i am charlie
and charlie is me
you dig man
well here we are
give me the money
you bring it out
ill pay the dude
no man no fronts
the man doesnt
front for anybody
hed be running it
fifty yards from the house
and taking the
money right back
thats not a fucking front
hey look hes not gonna
change his rules for me
now do you want this or not
because i dont care
we can go right now
cmon lotsapoppa
give me the money

oh the race war was something
we believed in totally
it wasnt the
reason for the murders
but the belief that there was
going the be a great race war
was something that
hung in the atmosphere
and drove us crazy
charlie thought lotsapoppa

charlie was terrified
that the black panthers
would come down on us
for shooting lotsapoppa
thats a really nice shirt
youre wearing there

i remember hearing
about the cop who shot the
sixteen year old black kid
we had the race
riots in watts
the black panthers
in san francisco
martin luther king had
just been assassinated
so charlies rap didnt
seem too far out at all
it didnt seem
like it was going to
happen a month from now
it was happening right now
right now
i love you

i think thats really the
crux of the entire story here
that that was the springboard
for these killings
that was the first
domino to tip over
and it it lead to the rest

charlies the only
complete man ive ever met

talk him into anything
he wont take any
back talk or whining
ahhhh
tex
oh weve missed you
charlies missed you
where the hell have you been
are you staying
yeah
yeah
whats that
youve got a lot
of catching up to do
he never really gave orders
he was so evil
he would just scare us to
death with his preachings
every night hed tell us
that there was going
to be a race war
and that whitey and the blacks
were going to go to war
and it was going
to he the worst war
the world had ever seen
and he said that
we had to be ready
to save the children
and rescue the
homeless babies
and carry them off into
the desert to safety
and he said we had to start
collecting dune buggies
and guns and supplies
and all these other
things to help us survive
and then he would just calmly
pull out this buck knife
and he said i dont know
about the rest of you
but im going to
start carrying a knife
theres no good or no
evil there just is
did you have any idea
you were going to be
one of the apostles
hmm
an apostle
what the hell is that
supposed to mean
cmon tex why else would
you and i be here right now
why would any of us be here
oh
charlie
thats right
cmon patty
tex
well you know
who he is dont you
its all true tex
i know about these things
i know its all true
i used to teach sunday school
i was studying to be a
nun before i met charlie
the gospel
according to charlie
is all you girls know
youre absolutely
fucking right tex
because charlie is christ
and christ is love
and charlie is love
that makes charlie
and christ one
the beatles laid it all
out on the white album
the four angels
with the faces of men
and the hair of women
thats the beatles
and the breastplates of fire
thats their
electric guitars see
you know who the fifth
angel is dont you
dont you
im just so sick of this
mind-fucking bullshit
you better be ready
two weeks everybodys
carrying a knife
and charlies teaching us
the best way to slit
a persons throat
just like theres no
past and no future
just now
thats all
thats important
the time is gonna come
when all men will judge
themselves before god
itll be the worst hell
the worst hell on earth
itll make nazi germany
look like a picnic
and you gotta be ready
for that right now
right here right
now just like that
and thats where
were at all the time
charlie set up
helter skelter patrols
we kept 24 hour a day lookouts
posted with shotguns
around the ranch
it was perfect
timing for charlie
because the family was
starting to drift apart
but now we were being pushed
to the last safe corner
of the earth the desert
now the district
attorney made up the lie
that charlie was trying to
start this black white war
to bring on armageddon
charlie didnt start the war
as far as we
were all concerned
it was already coming down
helter skelter is
the name of a song
performed by
the beatles period
helter skelter
was very real to us
for all we knew
it was happening
all the events
were taking place
and we thought we really
had to get to the desert
that the desert was the only
way that we could be saved
wed still make
music and orgy
but now it had this
dark underbelly to it
everything was biblical
and apocalyptic
we will kill anyone who
gets in our way period
what are we gonna do charlie
creepy crawl
some pigs house
of course i loved charlie
i felt like he was
the messiah come again
you know the second
coming of christ
king of the jews
drink from this
for this is my blood
the blood of the new covenant
which is shed for many
and the flames blew up
like the devils breath
shed for many
im the devil
im the devil
the devil
charlie im the devil
rise
rise
rise
rise
rise
rise
rise
rise
neither repented
they of their murders
nor of their sorceries
nor of their fornications
nor of their thefts
and they had a king over them
which is the angel of
the bottomless pit
whose name in the
hebrew tongue is abaddon
but in the latin tongue
hath his name is exterminans
and i started to
space it real bad
and i fucking looked over
and charlie looked
like the devil man
i said man i
think were in hell
and he said
yeah aint it groovy
i was getting some
real weird pictures
so i get out while
the getting was good
what do you mean
leaving you cant
will you go with me
why
you cant leave
i overheard tex and sadie
and theyre watching you
i gotta get out of here
why
what is going on
im sacred
whats wrong
charlie asked me
if i would kill somebody
whats in the bag sunshine
hi sadie
you cant kill
kill
bunch of people with their
backs up against the wall
willing almost to
kill someone
oh yeah
in a split second
kill crazy and
throw your life away
any traces of my own
will or personality
had totally
dissolved by this time
i was just as
extension of charlie
and i took my role of
enforcer very seriously
where were you going
whats the big deal
i just wanted to be
by myself for a while
she was wearing these
i like to see in focus
you were running away
i wasnt running away
look whats the big
deal all of a sudden
you guys are
acting like the ranch
has become a military camp
take them off
charlie told you
not to wear them
stop it
i want to wear them
dont you ever leave the
ranch without telling anyone
going out to death
valley you know
it made a lot of sense
somewhere that we could
raise our children
and let them teach us
some of the things
that we need to learn
in a place thats
closer to the land
and the stars
and the spirit of life
do it again and
ill kill you
well hang you in a tree
and well cut
your tongue out
you got no idea how desperate
things were out there
im not talking frustration
im talking lunacy
chanting
charlie thought that gary had
inherited a lot of money
so charlie asked
gary to join the family
and come with
us to the desert
gary said no
so charlie told bobby and
i to try to convince him
ive given you given you
all help in times of need
but im not following
charlie into the desert
i have my life and its here
were not asking
you to change gary
you can bring your your
gohanza
your gohanza out there
you can have everything
there that you have here
we love you gary
we need you man
i need you
no alright
youre still my brother
and my sister
but i must be true to myself
last chance
its gonna take a lot of
money for a move of this kind
ill give you
forty dollars okay
how about twenty grand
how about it
we need that money gary
the whole thing with gary
was that he had burned me
on a thousand
tabs of mescaline
i went there simply
to get my money back
i think you should
leave right now
bullshit
we aint kidding gary
bobby what are you doing
look i dont know
what charlie told you
but i dont have
twenty thousand dollars
and im not paying
youre bullshitting me
stop it bobby
get out of my house
watch him
im gonna find it
hes not gonna find anything
shut up
we trashed this place
we turned it upside down
i dont know what else
i dont know if he has it
alright fine
ok
alright fine
well be here
youre making terrible causes
causes youll answer
for in later life
charlies pissed at you man
you cant change the
causes youve made
but you can counter
them with positive ones
what the hell
you too sadie
just go
tell that to charlie
music playing
i cant think
with that shit on
music playing
trippy chick
yeah yeah go ahead
gary had no stomach
for what was going on
he just kept saying
over and over again
that he didnt
have any money and
and he was tired
and he wanted to go to sleep
me and bobby looked everywhere
in that house for money
knock on door
thats charlie
let him in
finally bobby didnt
know what to do
get up
get up
hey charlie
wheres bruce
charlie i dont
think you know what
youre doing by this
i want to talk
about that money jack
right now where is it
take your people and get out
scream
dont man
dont come back
without the money man
during my trial
the prosecution wanted to
involve charlie in my case
which is difficult because he
was never there at any time
i cut gary when
we were fighting
and it wasnt his ear
it was more like this
little slash on his cheek
take this
its a little safer
clean up woman
i think at that point charlie
knew what was going on
but we didnt
i know bobby was not at all
ready for what was happening
shut up
im gonna go get
someone to fix his ear
youre not going anywhere
look we dont
have bandages
and he will keep bleeding
until you tell us where
that fucking money is gary
hes not gonna tell
us a fucking thing
unless we help him
thats right
im gonna rip
this place apart
and youre gonna watch him
i am going to get some
medical supplies right now
you do what i say sadie
fuck you
youre so fucking stupid
here gary drink this
we gotta do something
we cant stay
here much longer
ive turned this
place upside down
what do you want to do
well call the
ranch ask charlie
ask charlie

charlie always has
an answer right
its not always
the right answer
but he always has an answer
what the hell else
have we ever done
thats right what the hell
else have we ever done
you bastards
will fry for this
youre descending into
the lower worlds gary
wheres your faith
chanting

maybe charlie will let us
take him back there
hey charlie

chanting
whats going on
chanting
no bobby bobby no

stab him again bobby
chanting
bobby would you help me
to die is a beautiful thing
its its everything
its every color in
the spectrum of light
every sound
every note in all music
i returned and tried
to cover up my tracks
but i left some prints
why political piggy
to put it off on the blacks
well thats why
bobby made the paw print
you know the black panthers
i had a lot of anxiety
over getting busted
i split the ranch on the
pretence of ditching the car
some cops woke me up
one morning on the
side of the road
called in the car
found the knife in the car
hauled my ass in
effectively negating all of
my creative efforts forever
this is all your
fault charlie
shut up
you shut up
as long as any
of us are in jail
were all in jail you know
im walking around out here
but im in jail with
every single young person
that should be free you know
im in the hall of
justice with charlie
and im on death
row with bobby
wow they got bobby
it was for the
love of brother
this had nothing to do
with the race war no
no blacks against
whites no armageddon
it no white album
no helter skelter
that wasnt what it was about
then he went on about
how we were a family
and we werent going
to let one of our
brothers rot in jail
girls loved bobby
enough to do this
as they took these
peoples lives
they were willing to
give their own lives
and thats what theyre doing
right now on death row
its for the love of brother
we knew that charlie was
willing to give his life
he brought up the
subject of lotsapoppa
and how that
had been my mess
and how he had to
clean that one up
that he had taken a life
and now it was my turn
to repay that debt
well the girls decided
if they found the police
if they found more bodies
with with writing
on the wall in blood
that that theyd assume
the killer was on the loose
and theyd let bobby go
he told me that
the girls had a plan
and that they needed me
to help them carry it out
he said go to
terrys old place
take all the money you find
and kill anyone there
i was getting into
my creepy crawl clothes
and me and tex were
sneaking some speed
and getting ready to go
linda get up
wake up

listen to him
and leave a sign
you girls know what i mean
something witchy
so i led them there
i had been there
three times before

vampire or something
and i would
point at my victim
shut up
and i would dance
in front of him
i wish youd shut up
shut up shut the fuck up

i had the girls
wait in the car
while i climbed
the telephone pole
and cut the wire

coming up the driveway

well whats the big deal
a million babies are

tex told me to dip
a towel in her blood
and write something that
would shock the world
so i did
charlie was waiting for us
when we got
back to the ranch
sitting naked
in the moonlight
he asked us if we had any
remorse for what wed done
and of course the
right answer was no
i remember patty
telling me about it
and then i went through a
change and and i thought
right on i guess we did it
well the next night
charlie gathered up clem
sadie leslie patty and me
and told us to come with him
well um
charlie made sure that he
he sort of made
me feel really guilty
and said that
i should want to do it
because it was
going to help bobby
linda drove of course
because she had the
only valid drivers license
and we went to this house that
charlie had once partied at
and he said were gonna do
the one on the
right of that house
he said that the night
before had been too messy
and that this time we were
gonna do it differently
so he went inside
and he tied up the
couple who lived there
with some leather laces
and he came back out
and he told uh
patty and leslie and me
to go in and kill them
charlie cant cant we
just can we just go now
can we just go now charlie
but dont tell them
what youre gonna do

get out of here
so i can make something
good with my life
oh i had patty
write on the walls
and the refrigerator
with their blood
the girls got something to
eat from the refrigerator
i took a shower
and then we just hitch
hiked back to the ranch
theyre willing to be in jail
they know that theyre
in jail for everybody
and maybe well all
have to go to jail
before we can get them out
maybe well have to go
up to the jail and say
hi take me
but they know theyre
facing the gas chamber
and they dont care
thats what people
dont understand
they dont care
and theyre willing to die
for all young
people to be free
snitches will
be taken care of
charlie said
charlie said
they had to kill shorty
he had to have clem
chop his head off
i heard that
shorty wouldnt die
unless they
chopped his head off
charlie said he knew too much
he actually punched her out
shorty
charlie
so we cut him into ribbons
shorty
right
first we dosed him
then we hogtied him
while he was tripping
we stuck needles
under his fingernails
and in his eyes
through his nipples
and cock
its not nice
to snitch shorty
he pissed himself
piss and blood
then we drug him
through the mud
and he was
screaming for his life
and charlie gave the word
and we stabbed him like caesar
everybody the whole family
he just wouldnt die
we just kept stabbing
and stabbing and stabbing
and stabbing and
stabbing and stabbing
so clem cut his head off
we cut him into nine pieces
and buried him in nine places
his legs are buried
right under you
its not nice to snitch
the girls made up that story
about us chopping him
up into nine pieces
even the prosecutor
put that in his book
but when clem led the
police out to the ranch
they found the skeleton
intact of course
no no
pull over
get out
god help me
its ready
the revolution is ready
and as soon as charlie
gets out its on
the revolution is on
and if you try
to hurt charlie
youll all die
he is god
perfect
as perfection is
because its exactly
the same thing
i had a brother once
who was shot
and killed like that
for nothing in the war
i mean its exactly
the same thing
every single day
love is being killed
were all in this together
you gotta stab
as long as charlie
is locked away
in his asylum
prison grave
you can say anything
you want about him
you can make more bogus books
and movies about his life
you can joke about him
you can pretend to be him
you can say and do
anything you want
but the truth is
you dont have the
soul to face him
youre a lot of vultures
you are
you live off the sacrifice
of the young people
youre bloodsuckers
you are
with your little
phallic symbols you know
were waiting for our
father to be set free
hes a genius
you dont realize
its the second
crucifixion of christ
judgment day
is coming people
leslies lawyer
ronald
the press called him
leslies hippy lawyer
and we all thought
he was pretty cool
but he was just
like the others
he was the first of
the retaliation murders
we are all facing
the gas chamber
hey hey man

think would happen
if one night seventy
five heads were cut off

judged yourselves

do you think the book obscene
why dont you buy the book
and find out for yourself
how much is it
$730 with the tax
wrap it up
you the manager round here
yeah the day manager
who do i bring it back to

ben fremont
emphatic orchestral chord

literary conversations

suspenseful music
against ticking clock
dramatic orchestral chord
police officer
mr fremont
you are ben fremont
manager of the argus book store
youre puttin me on
mr fremont id better
introduce myself officially
im sergeant kellog
assigned to the vice bureau
of the county sheriff office
i knew you seemed weird
my partner here
is officer lverson
mr fremont were
placing you under arrest
under section 32
of the california penal code
what the hell for
the code states that any person
who knowingly offers to distribute
any obscene matter
is guilty of a misdemeanour
the district attorney feels that
the book the seven minutes
by jj jadway would be found
obscene if taken to court
you cant arrest me
im just a guy who sells books
ijust work here
dramatic orchestral chord
telephone ringing
lyrical gershwinesque tune
telephone ringing
slapping sound
mike it phil sanford
phil how the hell are ya
well ill tell you about that
in a minute
oh uh
congratulations are in order
i read that you took over
your dad publishing firm
it been a year and a half now
you sound uptight man
the police raided the
argus book store in oakwood
yeah i know the store
but what that got to do with you
they arrested the clerk
ben fremont
on an obscenity charge
for selling a new book of ours
the seven minutes by jj jadway
now mike
this book is not pornographic
anyway fremonfs been in jail
several hours now
and i want him bailed out at once
how do you want to plead
if he pleads not guilty
that means a trial
i want to get him out of this
fast and quietly
ihave got to put a stop to
the little nuisance arrests like this
right at the outset
well now selling pornography
in california is a misdemeanour
as far as i recall it a
maximum fine of $0000
a year in jail plus $5
for every unit of
obscene material confiscated
mike but the kid was arrested
once before on the same charge
ah excuse me phil
let me see that a felony
now that a $25000 maximum fine
just for openers
and a year in prison
damn it mike i cant let
fremont go to jail
for selling sanford house book
wait a minute
there one other possibility
i might be able to get the whole thing
taken care of quickly and quietly
we enter a nolo plea
now that to say a guilty plea
without conceding to the charge
you pay the fine and you arrange
to have the
jail sentence suspended
we have a da out here
a man named elmo duncan
a very decent guy
mike
mike dont worry
ill see duncan tomorrow
arrange for the bail bondsman
and look in on fremont
sorry i unloaded on you buddy
but im sure you know that this
is pretty important to me
get some sleep huh
good night phil
laughing youre bad
youre really bad baby
faye
faye faye
come on now it after midnight
you know were both tired
and you know how i hate
being interrupted
michael daddy isnt going to
like your dirty book
when i go to work for daddy
that when daddy makes the decisions
until then i call my own shots
raunchy big-band music
cmon
daddy was discussing
us today michael
he anxious to know
when youre going to
make an honest woman
out of his daughter
ive got the message
miss osborn
how is your charming fiancée
she fine sir
you must remember me to both faye
and your prospective father-in-law
you know if it werent for
willard osb0rn dinner parties
i wouldnt have to worry
about my weight
what can i do for you
mr barrett
well sir im looking for a favour
anything
anything within reason
im representing the sanford house
of new york city
the publisher of the seven minutes
the seven minutes
oh yes the fremont case
mike
that rig ht
mr duncan may i ask
have you read the book
to be quite frank about it no
well a number of
very important critics say
that the seven minutes
is not hardcore pornography
the sort of thing that
dumped into a drugstore
by quick-buck printers
appealing to the one-armed reader
the book is being
published by one of
the most reputable firms
in the book trade
well let see what
it all about
the complaint was filed
by a mrs olivia st clair
president of the strength
through decency league in oakwood
a couple of my boys read the book
there is no doubt in their mind
it is pornographic
but the real question is
whether or not the seven minutes
is legally obscene
by contemporary
community standards
my client has advised me
that the jadway book
is no more or less explicit than
works of far less artistic merit
s0 why the sudden arrest
well my office has been under
considerable pressure
from mrs st clair
with some justification
we had to satisfy her
and with fremonfs arrest
you appeased the book-burner
weve done our duty but then
you have a duty to your client
im willing to co-operate
within the limitations
of what already has happened
this would satisfy sanford
ben fremont pleads nolo
pays a stiff fine
and in return we have his
one-yearjail sentence suspended
you understand
entering a nolo plea
is tantamount
to pleading guilty
which means the book
will be banned in oakwood
i dont give a damn
about oakwood
let it be unavailable there
and that way you satisfy
the stdl
and their specific community
but still the seven minutes
could be sold
anywhere else in the county
what youve suggested
well sounds reasonable to me
this is a nuisance matter
we can treat it routinely
ill smooth out any ruffled feathers
in the department
and when that done
you enter your plea of guilty
and ill speak to the judge
it probably wont be any more than
a fine and a suspended jail sentence
fair enough
i should have something for you
about this time tomorrow
oh by the way
when you see willard osborn
tell him im
very appreciative
of the time and attention
his network has given me lately
man our next senator
for the state of california
evening luther
baby doll
baby doll
hi
harvey
elmo
in/vin
if our president had looked that good
on television a few years ago
he would have been elected
governor instead
sorry im late luther
things got busy downtown
loud rocknroll music
shut that thing off
ive said it before
and ill say it again
before we make our move
elmo has got to become
a state-wide hero
if the voters can identify
with him were home free
two weeks ago we found
a meaningful issue
namely that much of this
youthful violence
is provoked by salaciousness
in reading matter and in films
then we agreed
to try to implement
the california criminal
code on censorship
by making an arrest
thereby using a book as an issue
on which to build a state-wide case
on which elmo could fight the
smut merchants
yes and by this act
and by the trial that might follow it
elmo would become known
as a protector of the young
and an enemy of
violence-inciting literature
that is a lot of crap
enough of the pool
it pits the district attorney
against some two-bit book salesman
and some obscure printed words that
nobody will ever read or hear about
it should be plain to all of us now
the fremont rouse was a flop
let forget it
let go on to something else
with a little more promise
loud crunching
baby doll will you stop that
now there another
factor involved here
the publisher of the seven minutes
is being represented
by a mike barrett
you might recall
that barrett is engaged
to willard osborn daughter faye
now considering the support
ive been getting
from osborn television network
the time will be
i think it would be foolish
ten
to rock the boat
mtwenty-nine and
shut that off
beep click
elmo right
forget about this penny ante stuff
ourjob tonight is to find
that big issue
rocknr0ll music
hey baby now remember

radio volume turned right up

jerry

youre on a midnight ride
the love train
tour through the countryside
the love train
song fades out
car engine cuts off
footsteps insects chirping
police officers
dont move
dramatic sinister music
d0 you have any identification
yeah
this what youre
looking for griffith
where did you find it
by the broken body of a young girl
rocknr0ll music
excuse me sir police chief patterson
wishes to speak to mr duncan
let take it on the speakerphone
yes sir
elmo patterson
what is it tim
sorry to bother you mr duncan
about an hour ago
we logged a brutal 907
rape victim a 9-year-old
caucasian miss shen moore
admitted to county hospital
in a coma
there some big game involved
who is it
frank griffith son
frank griffith
the name means nothing to me
frank griffith handles all of
mr yerkes advertising
he also one of the party
biggest contributors
that the one
the boy denied raping the girl
and he also pleads innocent
to injuring her
any evidence to indicate
the boy was lying
lm gonna look at the sheet
wallet $23 in cash
three textbooks in the
trunk of his car
a fourth book under
the spare tyre
and coincidentally
it was the same dirty book
involved in that bookseller arrest
this morning the seven minutes
elmo tell him goodbye
son of a bitch
weve got our case
tim well discuss this
in the morning
thank you mr duncan
what do you mean
weve got our case
baby doll
shut off that damn radio
music clicks off
cant the next senator from the
state of california
figure this one out for himself
it very simple frank griffith son
a poor kid with a normal sex urge
and theyre trying to pin him
with breaking and entering
raucous laughter
maybe the kid is innocent
who gives a goddamn
but you know who responsible
the real criminal
it that dirty slimy book
the seven minutes
that incited a decent kid
from a good family
to commit felonious rape
yeah but luther
elmo weve finally got hold of
the big issue weve been looking for
barman get the car
jawohl
blair call frank griffith
tell him we just heard
about his trouble
and were on our way to help him
in any way we can
now he is still innocent until
proved guilty in a court of law
what im really saying is that
the law still gives us certain options
are you saying he can
still plead not guilty
frank let him finish
if he pleads not guilty
the case will be placed
on the court calendar for trial
if he pleads guilty
the sentence could be anywhere
from 5 years to life
what good all this
i already told the cops what i did
she hurt herself
dont interrupt
i agree that
as things stand
a not guilty plea would
not only be dishonest but futile
trial a waste of time
now consider this behind closed doors
our district attorney could have
a great influence with thejudge
who was to pass sentence
after a plea of guilty for rape
but i didnt rape her
the book the criminal
not the boy
if the seven minutes
hadnt been available
jerry would have never
committed the crime
i see
i see
he was temporarily inflamed by
that book he was victimised
now well need time to let this
concept sink into the public mind
in order to create an atmosphere
much more favourable to jerry
doesnt anything i say
mean a damn
considering jerry condition
i would offer as a defence
that he was not legally sane when
he allegedly committed the crime
to accomplish this well need
the services of a top psychiatrist
i would suggest
dr roger trimble
i wont let any headshrinker
pick my brain apart im not crazy
louis polk knows the law
if he says your seeing a psychiatrist
will help you with thejudge
it makes sense to do just that
jerry
let your niece calm him down
~ jerry
maggie l__
im sure they were only
trying to be helpful in their way
i dont want my brain
picked in public
i understand jerry
ljust wanna be left alone
jerry griffith is living proof that
a dirty book can destroy a clean boy
im convinced were not dealing
with a mere felony
but a crime that could
endanger public safety
like uh an epidemic of rape
i was referring to
your client distribution
of a menacing work
of obscenity mr barrett
if you plead ben fremont
not guilty
we will prosecute the defendant
to the limit of the law
if you prefer to enter
a plea of guilty
the defendant will receive the
maximum punishment for his offence
a fine and twelve months in jail
n0 deal deal mr barrett
loud clunk of weights
ls that your last word
yes mr barrett
what kind of a plea do you intend
to enten guilty or not guilty
ill have to consult with my client
there can be no compromise
if you plead guilty fremont
will go tojail for a year
and the book will be banned
in the county as a starter
if the plea is not guilty
youll have to take
your gamble in court
really pissed me off
with duncan attitude
aside from being
obviously hostile
he gave me that politician
holier-than-thou number
mike a little to the right honey
higher yeah right here
mmm that feels good
michael
mmm
are you considering turning down dad
position to take on sanford case
what wrong darling
ive got a late date
with the seven minutes
i promised sanford
id make my decision
about defending the book
by tomorrow morning
and taken in its entirety
and not out of context
the book is definitely
not obscene
the seven minutes
is a beautiful book
oh there clay rutherford
right there
he one of the most thorough
investigative attorneys ive worked with
mr rutherford
mr sanford
i took the first plane out when mike
told me you two would take the case
clay has a line-up of potential witnesses
why dont we run through them
our line-up is exactly one witness
you mean so far
no mr sanford
i uh i mean one period
with the existing political climate
were not going to find
many volunteers for this cause
tell him who we got clay
christian leroux his firm published
the original edition of the book
now weve been led to believe that
he considered the seven minutes
to be a work of artistic integrity
sanford ireca/i however that
he sold the world publishing rights
to an alleged pornographer
named norman c quandt
clay any idea of his whereabouts novfi
sanford n0
clay should be able
to get a line on him
our really big issue will be
to prove that jadway wrote the book
honestly sincerely
and with artistic integrity
that why lemux is so
important to us
hello mr barrett
hi donna
mr rutherford sir
clay we can also get some mileage
out of the findings
made by the president commission
on obscenity and pornography
they clearly verify that so-called
obscene books and motion pictures
do not contribute in any way
to an increase in antisocial behaviour
by adults or juveniles
looks like it not going to be as
simple as we thought ls it mike
incredibly philip no the case is
a lot more complicated now
i guess so mike this might not
be the right time to bring this up
but do you want me to stay
for the trial
im up to here with
pre-publication deals back home
no as a matter of fact
it might be better
to keep you out of
the picture entirely
until we need you
as a witness
one more thing to remember
gentlemen
elmo duncan will not
be sitting on his ass
our critics would like to believe
that the church only interest
is in morality and religion at
the sacrifice of freedom of speech
we wish to criticise only those
who would abuse this freedom
we are of the same mind
your eminence
we dont want
a weakened freedom
but rather reinforce it by
penalising those who would corrupt it
the church has seen fit
to extend its co-operation
wewing the seven minutes today
just as it did in the thirties
when it was first banned
in the sacred index
as an extraordinary
destructive force
i couldnt be more pleased
your eminence
i own enlighten
and will help you
mike
now the police report states
that they confiscated eighty copies
of the seven minutes
and the sanford house
sales department account shows
they shipped a hundred copies
to this store
those figures correct
uh-huh
that means you sold twenty copies
before you were arrested
any idea who bought them
zero i only work here days
have you seen the picture of
jerry griffith in the newspaper
his picture and mine too
ive got a better shot of him
right here
and i want you to take
a close look at this
he ever been in this store
not that i can recall
with all this publicity i get
phone calls every day
asking ifl have
the book for sale
even rachel hoyt
the head branch librarian
for the oakwood library
called this morning
very uptight about this attempt
to ban the seven minutes
interesting
she wont wait to order
the book through channels
she wants to pick one up herself
put it on the open shelves
and have a showdown
with the old bags who run the
strength through decency league
would you believe frank griffith
telling the press
it was jj jadway and
the seven minutes
not his son who was responsible
for sheri moore brutal attack
when was the last time
you saw jerry
that was it he sent a friend
over to return the dictionary
do you recall his friend
a long-haired boy the only one
i saw with jerry more than once
i think his name was perkins
i hear youre a good friend
of jerry griffith
who told you that
head librarian
at the oakwood branch
said she saw you with him
a couple of times
he got wheels he gave me
a lift now and then that about it
well lwas told that
you were close friends
you were told wrong man
did you ever meet any members
of jerry family
nope
did you ever hear jerry
discuss his father
nope
when was the last time
you saw him
maybe a week before
he beat on that chick
and you havent seen him since
n0 and i wouldnt want to either
how come
with all the available chicks around here
who wants to owe
the guy who gets it that way
that a bummer
i hear he reads a lot
what the hell do these look like
everybody reads a lot here
yeah i guess youre right
but im only interested
in one particular book
have you ever seen him reading
the seven minutes or discussing it
oh youre sounding like a pig
like a stinkin pig fuck off
the services of father sarsatti
one of the two priests directly
in charge of the sacred index
has been offered as a leading
witness for your prosecution
father sarsatti
is prepared to make public
all the classified information
the church has on the infamous book
and its equally infamous author
do you wish him as a witness
for the prosecution
yes your eminence
i must have him
when do you want him in here
within three days four at the most
i will notify the vatican
father sarsatti will be here
and the lord
will bless our cause
uplifting hymn-like music
im olivia st clair
president of the oakwood chapter
of the strength through
decency league
polite applause
most of you already know
that our president has called for
a citizens crusade against obscenity
both in print and in pictures
that just what the stdl
is trying to implement
our work was never more important
than it is today
st clair the fact that there are
faye why the big rush
it not exactly like
youre the guest of honour
hey there someone i know
maggie how are you
good to see you faye
faye oh forgive me
meet my fiance
maggie russell michael barrett
how do you do
i thought i recognised you
you mean those terrible newspaper
pictures do me justice
i happen to have
a special interest in your case
st clair hard-hitting action
and by that i mean
vigorous positive enforcement
of existing obscenity laws
wed better grab a seat
all over the country
and with courageous americans
see you around maggie
like our guest of honour today
to do the enforcing
it is now with the
greatest of pleasure
that i give you our county
distinguished district attorney
mr elmo duncan
applause
thank you
thank you very much
glad you all could make it
mrs st clair has asked me
to say a few words
on the subject of pornography
as related to our permissive society
i cannot think of a subject
which is more relevant
there is virtually no area
that remains untainted
by the quick-buck artists who
pander to our lowest forms of taste
and the public be damned
just the other evening
my first night off in weeks
i decided to take my wife mary
and our three children to the movies
in our neighbourhood
we had such subject material
as rape lust motorcycle gangs
homosexuals
lesbianism
im going to take a walk
ill be right back
drug abuse you name it
whatever happened to the movies we
used to be able to take our children to
applause
mike remember to tell me what i missed
films that offered
real movie stars
like the charming lady seated to my left
miss constance cumberland
enthusiastic applause
never in the history of our great nation
has there been such a proliferation
of obscene material on the screen
the magazine racks and the bookshelves
the pomographers
mike miss russell
while i had a chance lwanted
to have a few words with you
about your relatives the griffiths
faye mentioned your
relationship with jerry
and
well she said you were
very close to him
were not only relatives
were friends
im prepared to defend jerry
against anyone who wants to hurt him
well i have no reason to hurt jerry
my interest in him
is merely professional
you see from what i know
about juvenile delinquency
im not convinced
that reading-matter alone
can be held responsible
for antisocial acts
i was hoping wed have
a chance to talk about this
i wont even dignify the thought
of such a discussion
i suppose itd be foolish of me to ask
if jerry father would see me
you cant be serious mr barrett
youre annoying me
well im sorry i really am
car engine starts
but you could have snubbed me
good manners miss russell
not good manners mr barrett
i just wanted to find out
if you were really
the kind of son of a bitch
everyone said you were
jerry i feel these sessions
can be very beneficial to you
i dont like to talk about myself
well im afraid your father
and mr yerkes have other plans
concerning your
co-operation this afternoon
you tell him his loser company
aint worth that much money
well fly him back
from the goddamn safari
when people find out he
killing defenseless animals
with a machine gun
it eighty-six for him anyway
raucous laughter what an idea
for art buchwald column
howd it go
well jerry is completely ambivalent
about sheri moore
on the one hand he hates to
discuss the circumstance
but on the other when he does discuss it
he reveals a certain pride in the act
what else
jerry also has a wish
for self-destruction
possibly real but more likely fantasy
i feel he should be subjected
to as few pressures as possible
frank the boy needs help
he in bad shape
what the hell wrong now
well never get him to testify
until we get him back on the track
i think the kid and trimble
should get together
every day between now and the trial
well that makes
a great deal of sense
fine now let see what
happening in the other room
lushly romantic piano music
good to see you merle
griffith trimble
come over here
i want you to meet merle reid
a truly great american
mr reid this is a real pleasure
i catch your newscast every night
you flatter me mr griffith
i hope youll tell that to
the rating surveyors when they call
everyone laughs
im really looking
fonlvard to this luther
when my viewers see
what the smut peddlers
have done to that poor young boy
youll have a groundswell of sentiment
big enough to swamp the queen mary
thumps table
good man
i think theyre ready
well jerry you wont feel a thing
you have nothing to worry about
crew member
any time youre ready mr reid
were rolling
speed jerry griffith interview take one
clapperboard snaps shut
and action mr reid
ladies and gentlemen i am sitting in
the home of the frank griffith family
an average american family
if you will until the night before last
when a shattering experience
catapulted them into the headlights
young jerry griffith
whom you see seated beside me
was taken into police custody
and charged with the most heinous crime
a crime which had been
perpetrated by the reading
of an awful ugly and
yes ill use the word
a patently obscene book
until now not one soul
from the television media
has been granted the opportunity
of speaking with young jerry
but he and his father have
graciously allowed me the privilege
of being the first and only news man
to hear the family side of the story
tell me jerry
was the seven minutes
part of your reading assignments
at the university
i really dont wanna talk about it
i couldnt be more in sympathy
with your feelings
but the public does have a right to know
how this book led you astray
tell us now exactly how
the seven minutes prompted you
to run out and violate this girl
emphatic echoing chords
i dont wanna talk about it
frenzied orchestral music
voice trembling
for the first time
in my newscasting career
i am speechless
permit me however
to leave you with this question
how many other killer books are in
the hands of your sons and daughters
yes your sons and daughters
this very moment
now youve seen what a dirty book
can do to a youngster
no ive seen sickness mr yerkes
but it wasnt caused by any book
youd better go shopping
for a new psychiatrist
you cant afford me
nowjust a minute you

is gonna be great
simply first class
emphatic orchestral music
operator this is kme 55

ill be right there
dr quigley a good man
hell make a discreet report and
everything will be kept very quiet
ijust cant imagine
what made jerry do it
id like to ask you something
go ahead
were you following jerry
no i was looking for someone else
one of his friends george perkins
im sorry you must think
i suspect every move you make
music
jerry was bugged by a couple of things
that happened at the house today
now no-one expects you
to be unfaithful to the cause
luther yerkes was there today
he brought over a psychoanalyst
and jerry was forced to go into therapy
with this guy against his will
luther yerkes at the griffiths
until now id only heard rumours that
he was backing duncan for the senate
then mr yerkes
wheeled out merle reid
to interview jerry
on coast-to-coast television
just simply
you know i always think
excuse me go ahead
n0 no you go ahead
you know my whole attitude
toward you has changed 80 degrees
before i came to work
for the griffiths
there was a woman working there
as a nurse to mrs griffith
after she quit or was fired
that when i was offered the job
maybe she could
give you a little help
do you remember her name
isabel vogler
she lived out in laurelvale
that the most i can offer you
by way of appreciation
for what you did tonight
thank you
now ive got to run thank you
ld like to see you again
no prying i promise strictly social
it tempting but im afraid not
if i was seen with you in public
but if i can ever help you
in any way that doesnt
jeopardise my relationship
with the family
well you have my private number
ill remember that
oh by the way
i read the seven minutes
it a beautiful book
music playing
youve got a suspicious look
on your face
faye
how can you drink that in the morning
is that why you stopped by
to check on my drinking habits
you were supposed to call last night
i got into this thing
part of the investigation
you know the woman you passed by
on the way out of here
well uh that was frank griffith
former housekeeper mrs isabel vogler
now she agreed
to testify at the trial
about the conditions
existing in the griffith home
particularly as to how they affected
one mr jerry griffith
can you trust someone like that
mrs vogler is as trustworthy
as any of duncan witnesses
s0 why the sudden concern
im just worried about the nasty
people youre becoming associated with
over an unworthy piece of trash
first of all the book
isnt a piece of trash
there no-one around to
contaminate me so let cool it huh
well ive gotta get to
the office now or ill be late
faye
faye i really am sorry
about last night
see you later and make up for it huh
both good and bad news mike
give me the bad first
lemux sold out for a higher price
and he flying in from paris
to testify for duncan
the good news is that ive
located norman c quandt
gee that great where is he
he operates something called the uh
arts and sciences cinema company
at 348 donovan drive
imposing title
well it probably
one of the leading manufacturers
of pornographic movies
on the west coast
nudies beavers the whole bit
when could i see him
right now man he expecting you
im on my way
okey doke
quandt there nothing dirty
about these pictures
now back to that creep leroux let
go to my office and check the files
back in 47 i flew over to paris
to get a first-hand look
at some of the highly touted
french stuff
my contact was leroux a publisher of
dirty books and part-time pimp
among other things he made me an
offer for three raunchy paperbacks
one of them was the seven minutes
do you recall him saying anything
about the author of
the seven minutes jj jadway
yeah in fact he turned over
a pack of letters
written by jadway to his mistress
some chick named
cassie mcgraw
yeah
you mean you actually have
letters written by jadway
till a week ago i unloaded them
on an autograph dealer in new york
can you give me his name
the autograph hunter
siren blares
panicked shrieking
inaudible shouting
get outta the place
youll tip the da
you gotta be out of your head
im on the other side

to me before
now get outta here
the autograph dealer
olin adams
55th street new york

cod in the morning
no i need them sooner than that
im flying to new york tonight
ill be in your shop between
nine and ten and ill pay in cash
as you wish sir
right
jadway speaking from the grave
those letters can wipe out
leroux contention
that jadway was
a money-hungry pornographer
and weve got isabel vogler
to put down jerry griffith testimony
that the book alone turned him on
we are finally getting it together
phone buzzes

mr griffith places a large amount of
advertising on dad television stations
so naturally you can understand
how daddy felt when he heard
you were going to call a witness
who would malign frank griffith
how did dad feel
concerned enough to pay
a visit to mr griffith
to prepare for any libel
mrs vogler might be offering
beautiful
after his talk with griffith
dad was convinced mrs vogler
is a psychopathic liar
ok so now youve told me
the urgent news what else

of using isabel vogler on the witness
stand is out of the question

remove the evidence
and yours truly stumbled in on them
it not the first time thereve been
half a dozen other incidents
just as incredible mrs isabel vogler
suddenly refusing to testify
the loss of some
original jadway letters
and the real stunner
was the loss of leroux
the frenchman who first
published the seven minutes
now he saying jadway nothing more
than a squalid pornographer
the man with the big chequeb0ok

maggie exclaims joyfully

elmo it an inspired approach
for you for your son
and for our common cause
the state of california has charged
an unknown bookseller
named ben fremont
with selling filth
in the form of an underground
novel the seven minutes
which was written by an
expatriate author jj jadway
over three decades ago
now this trial has generated
enormous interest
and in light of impending
supreme court hearings
on the question of obscenity
in films and reading matter
this case could assume a
stature of national importance
please rise
face the flag of our country
recognising the principles
for which it stands
liberty and justice for all
department 0 of the superior court
of the state of california
is now in session the honourable
nathaniel upshawjudge presiding
please be seated and no smoking
gavel bangs
the case of the people of the state
of california versus ben fremont
is the defence ready to proceed
yes your honour
are the people ready to proceed
yes your honour
you may call your first witness
mr duncan
i call sergeant frank kellog of the
county sheriffs department to the stand
please raise your right hand
do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth and nothing
but the truth so help you god
i do
state your name for the record
sergeant frank kellog county
sheriff office administrative woe
please be seated
sergeant kellog is the man who
sold you a copy of
the seven minutes in this courtroom
yes sir he is
would you point him out
to the court please
that him
let the record show your honour
the witness sergeant kellog
indicated the defendant ben fremont
seated to the left of defence counsel
did mr fremont make any
comment about the book
any reference to
its erotic explicitness
well the defendant mr fremont told me
it was the most
banned book in history
he said and i quote it was banned
in every country in the world
because it was considered obscene
those were mr fremonfs own words
your witness mr barrett
sergeant kellog on your visit
to the argus book store
did you impersonate
an ordinary customer
no sir that not quite true
but since you intended to buy the book
for the purposes of assembling
evidence against the defendant
didnt you feel dishonest about
representing yourself as a customef
objection the witness
feelings are immaterial
objection sustained
forgive me your honour
sergeant kellog why was it necessary
to use a concealed tape recordef
well that standard
operating procedure
if we were going to bust a hooker
widespread laughter
l mean arrest a prostitute wed do
the same thing that perfectly legal
well i wont bother to comment
on the ethics of those vice officers
who circulate among bars
trying to entrap hoo
mprostitutes but i do wonder
how you feel about entrapping
a respectable bookseller with leading
questions and concealed tape recorders
elmo my next witness
in a manner of speaking
will be the book itself
i now submit that the seven minutes be
read aloud to the members of the jury
so that they may become
acquainted with its entire contents
seated in the witness box
is a neutral impartial citizen
a mr charles wynter a substitute
high school teacher locally
who in his spare time tapes
recordings for the blind
and is accustomed to reading aloud
without over-dramatising
or unduly emphasising
specific passages
objection your honour
with all due deference to the blind
the prosecution remarks
are deliberately intended
to appeal to the sympathy of the jury
objection overruled the district
attorney description of mr wynter
leaves no doubt of his
ability to remain impartial
elmo thank you your honour
your honour while i already
have this person available
i would willingly agree to let
anyone of mr barrett choosing
read the book aloud to the jury
your honour what i care about
is the book being read aloud
a novel is not meant to be
presented in such a fashion
that is my only objection
your objection mr barrett
is overruled
mr wynter may begin reading the book
in manner so prescribed by the court
thank you your honour
mr wynter
judge you may begin but please
address the reading to the jury
slowly and pedantically
a touch ls that you
my other lips swell in joyous welcome
god i have missed you
there now move
slowly past my moist lips
darling let me kiss all of you
feel me close around you
in sweet embrace
your honour i would like
to record my concern
about one mannerism possessed
by the reader mr wynter
which may be prejudicial
to the defence
the reader is placing undue emphasis
by raising his eyes on certain passages
which might be termed
sexually realistic
mr barrett i have been
watching mr wynter closely
i am satisfied he is
performing in a manner
as mechanical and objective
as possible for a human being
i must deny your request
please resume mr wynter
you were so strong
and yet when we are together
we both grow weak with the delicious
perfection of our union
this is your home this is the reason
for our existence
as a noted british publisher
of quality books
and a highly recognised authority
on the continental trade
mr van fleet do you feel that jadway
the author of the seven minutes
tried to give the reader some
understanding or vision of love
mr jadway knew nothing of love
let me tell you a favourite
anecdote about jadway
the story comes first-hand from
a simply marvellous study
entitled outside the mainstream
the author is dr hiram eberhart
a highly respected professor
at columbia university
now im going to quote
from him directly
your honour i object
this supposed anecdote from that book
would represent the
rankest form of hearsay
i object to any reading from outside
the mainstream whatsoever
i am conversant with dr eberhart
and believe his book
to be very material counsel
dont antagonise them
the witness will continue
one night after listening
to a prizefight on the radio
a contest in which joe louis
wrested the heavyweight championship
from one james braddock jadway
told friends who had been listening to it
with him that love
between a man and a woman
was most often performed
like a prizefight
when jadway was asked
to give examples of books
that depicted the
more common hostile love
he cited henry miller
tropic of capricorn
which he had just read
as a book that reflected
the brutality of l0ve
one of your witnesses elmo has got
to be a thinking man faggot
those queens are so afraid
of anything straight
theyre bound to be on our side
mthroughout the seven minutes is
an act of hatred against womanhood
jadway has unconsciously
taken on the role of a pugilist
attempting to down and
humiliate the opposite sex
end quote lfind myself in total
agreement with dr eberhart
how much did we offer
to pay him to testify
transportation plus five big ones
please raise your right hand
do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth and nothing
but the truth so help you god
i do
state your name for the record
my name is christian leroux
please be seated
i wonder how much
he got from the da
youd better believe
it wasnt chopped liver
mr leroux what is
your present occupation
im a publisher of books
when did you first become a publisher
in 933 my father died leaving me
a very modest inheritance
s0 i established my own
publishing house the etoile press
is this the same publisher that brought
out a work of fiction in 935 entitled
the seven minutes by jj jadway
the same
mr leroux i have seen
your original version of this book
which was printed in english
since it was published in paris
why was it not in the french language
the french government wouldnt permit
its publication in french
why not
the censorship bureau
declared it was obscene
obscene to your knowledge
has the seven minutes
ever been published in any other
country in any other language
oh no absolutely no
nation in the world
would pass on it or even accept it
literary critics in many countries
regarded it as the most
depraved book ever published
in the history of literature
your honour i object to mr leroux
self-serving answer
and i ask that it be stricken on the
grounds that it is incompetent
judge i think that the witness is
qualified to give that answer
motion to strike is denied
and objection overruled
proceed mr duncan
mr leroux what kind of
commercial success
did the seven minutes
have in france
well not as much as wed hoped
my initial printing was 5000 copies
this sold out in a year
then i ordered a press run
of another 5000 copies
but the sales slowed down
and eventually stopped
that is after the vatican
placed the book on the index
mike father sarsatti you testified that
the curia offices had been revamped
and streamlined since jj jadway
book was first published in 935
yes in 966 in keeping with
the new ecumenical council spirit
which pervaded the church
and all of christendom
pope paul vii abolished the title of the
supreme congregation of the holy office
because it had long been held
offensive by protestants
who associated it with
what they regarded as
persecution in early church history
is it not true father that at the
convening of the ecumenical council
there were numerous roman catholic
clerics who protested against
the old holy office the very
office that condemned jadway
because it did not hold
fair hearings for authors
the catholic church
is a democratic body
its bishops and cardinals
are given total freedom
in the formation of their opinion
there were those who chose to express
some measure of disagreement
with the rulings of the holy office
would it not follow then father
that in view of the new liberality
on the part of the church
that what the church condemned
and prohibited in 935
it might not condemn
and prohibit today
signore sir that is
a hypothetical question
which i have neither the qualifications
nor the authority to answer
let me say this however
that i am here before you
as a representative of the vatican
because the church is just as
concerned today as it was in 935
about the publication and circulation
of an immoral and sacrilegious work
of fiction entitled the seven minutes
you got it now harvey i want you to hit
them with as many numbers as possible
make it sound like this dame
is second cousin to every one
of those clowns in that jury box
our average woman
resides in an urban area
in a city of less than
00000 population
which qualifies oakwood
to supply this woman
she has a five-room home
worth $000
half the house is mortgaged
the house has a bathtub or shower
flush toilet electricity telephone
tv set and washing machine
no air conditioning
no clothes dryer no food freezer
the average woman spends
seven hours a day
in the kitchen
performing her household chores
very impressive mr underwood
youve covered everything
except her frequency of elimination
and the time of day
she prefers to fornicate
bangs gavel let us observe some of
the rules of taste counsellor
and would you please refrain
from turning your back to the court
forgive me your honour but i feel
the court should be a little more
enlightened about the average person
especially in relationship
to statistics
now as i understand it 5% of the
us population is female
while 49% is male
now according to what youve said
that means
the average american is only female
now is that true
of course not
one cant average two absolutes
i was referring to concepts that
can be converted into statistics
such as age or income
i appreciate your wanting to talk
about numbers mr undenlvood
but i want to talk about persons
specifically the average person
mentioned in the criminal code
let me ask the jury this
supposing 50% of the
american population was male
and 50% was female
wouldnt the average
american be a queer
widespread laughter
order order order
now that weve established
your qualifications
as an average housewife to the
court satisfaction mrs white
can you tell us whether
you read a novel
called the seven minutes
written by jj jadway
i have lforced myself to read it
from cover to cover
as an average person in your community
applying contemporary standards
what was your reaction to this book
i found it sickeningly obscene
did you feel it went beyond
the customary limits of candour
in its description of nudity or sef
the seven minutes belongs
in a garbage disposal
if i had one
that where the book would go
elmo did you find anything in the novel
inaudible whispering
that could be considered as having
social redeeming importance
it was sex and more sex
and nothing else
i never laid eyes on
reading matter more obscene
thank you mrs white
your witness counsellor
mrs white since you are the first
average woman ive ever met
im eager to know
a little more about your taste
im anxious to know if your
reading habits are also average
they are
oh how do you know they are
i read a lot all the popular things
that come into the library
and in paperback
have you ever read peyton place
by grace metalious
of course not
have you read god little acre
by erskine caldwell
no i havent
have you read lady chattefley lover
by dh lawrence
i have not
have you read in his steps
by charles sheldon
no i never even heard of it
that very interesting mrs white
then by mr undewvoods standards
your reading habits are far from average
you see the four novels
i have just mentioned
sold over thirty million copies
in this country alone
to which i object your honour
the counsel is badgering the witness
in front of thejury
and is asking questions
in argumentative form
i know twenty books that outsold
the novels barrett mentioned
those are four of the five leading
best-sellers in american history
judge gentlemen let proceed
in an orderly fashion
i expect both of you to abide
by the rules of evidence
now let get on with the trial
mrs white would the average american
read the seven minutes
absolutely not
but youre supposedly average
and you read it didnt you
i was requested to read it
for this trial
oh otherwise you
would not have read it
most certainly not i dont waste
my time with obscene reading
but mrs white how would
you know it was obscene
if you didnt read it
i dont have to drink poison
to know that it poison
do you believe that writers
should say what they mean
when writing about sex
yes but they can do that
without using indecent words
like the words in that book
can you be specific about the words in
the seven minutes that offended you
well im certainly not
going to use them
point them out
let me see what you object to
go ahead the book wont bite
very fine mrs white
i appreciate
your co-operation
now what we have here
is the word fucking
shocked murmuring
ls that correct
excuse me mrs white
that is the word you object to
disgusting
would you have been happier
if the writer had used
such euphemisms as
they slept togethef
they were intimate
or they made love
i would have understood just as well
what the author was trying to say
but you could have been wrong
if kathleen and her man
had slept together were intimate
or they made love
they might have been
doing many other things
other than the only exact word
for this particular act
it cannot be mistaken
mrs white im not advocating
that coarse or vulgar words
should be used by everyone everywhere
i am saying that writers from
chaucer to jadway should be allowed
the freedom to use specific precise
words when writing realistically
now wouldnt you agree mrs white
i am not interested in the past
mr barrett
im interested in protecting
our morality in the present
especially the morality of our young
people so that our civilisation
doesnt decay and decline
the way others have done
emphatic music
thank you
remember when van fleet
mentioned the anecdote
about the night jadway was listening
to joe louis win the heavyweight title
by knocking out braddock
yeah
when did jadway die
february 937
correct jadway killed himself and was
promptly cremated in february 937
but here we have
dr eberhart telling us
how jadway read and discussed
tropic of capricorn
capricorn wasnt
published until 939
well maybe dr eberhart confused
his source of information
we confuse tropic of capricorn
with tropic of cancer
which im sure was published while
jadway was still very much alive
no no listen to this
page 624 joe louis
knocked out jim braddock
in the eighth round
in chicago in june 937
get it june 937
that means that jadway
was listening to the fight
four months after he was
supposed to be dead
now how does that grab you
a lot better
the distinguished dr eberhart may
have been wrong a second time
but twice in one paragraph from a
renowned scholar highly unlikely
this gives us a new and revived jadway
who did not die in february 937
as leroux and the priest testified
it gives us jadway very much alive
four months later
for that matter is he even dead
emphatic music
clay were back in business
you handle the
cross-examination tomorrow
if i hustle i can catch
the late flight to new york
eberhart could save our ass
a mistake could have been made
only by my source
dr eberhart i was unaware that there
was any source involved besides you
you see i assumed that you were
present when jadway made the
no i was not
my confidential source
was one of jadway closest friends
in paris in the 930s
who was he
well considering how i was misled
l see no reason
not to reveal his name
i acquired the information from
a poet named sean oflanagan
my name michael barrett
may i sit down
depends
could i buy you a drink
grab a chair
guinness a flagon of your best brandy
with a water back
what can i do for you young man
well sir im the lawyer
defending the reputation
of your old friend jj jadway
oh yes the seven minutes
dr hiram eberhart led me to believe
that you were one of
jadway closest friends
correct young man that precisely
why i wont discuss this subject
keep the change
thank you
on the contrary mr oflanagan
the censors wont let him rest
if i could only find out when
jadway died and how
suicide jumped into the grand canal
the poor wretched soul and drowned
when was that
allow me
the year of our lord
937 anno domini amen
then there appears to be
a slight contradition
concerning the date
of jadway death
based on the material
that you supplied dr eberhart
eberhart put it down wrong
and didnt hear me right
he taped the interview with you
i guess i screwed up
my dates and times
but i remember jadway death
as if it were yesterday
it was in all the papers
hurled himself from a six-storey
apartment building in san francisco
a minute ago you had him
drowning in the grand canal
did i now
could you have been mistaken
about the date of jadway death
maybe he died in 939 or 40
instead of 937
that is not possible
jadway was alive long after that
he enlisted the day after pearl harbor
made mincemeat of the kaiser
the kaiser was world war i
a pity you cant ask
cassie mcgraw about that
whatever happened to her
only the shadow knows
good day to you mr battle
michael michael over here
maggie
somebody once told me
that happiness is
being met at the airport
i had to see you
you look great
i thought youd be interested
in what happened in court
i spent the day in the gallery
you must be psychic
things were so tight
trying to make the plane
i didnt have a chance
to call the office
duncan brought out
two more literary experts
a professor from colorado
and a syndicated book reviewer
both said the book was obscene and
put it down for its prurient appeal
he also dragged in the two cops
who found sheri moore
and the physician who
examined her after the rape
mike im sure clay didnt let duncan get
away with cheap courtroom theatrics
evidence of sperm
within the vagina
objection
the violation of miss moore
has nothing to do with
this alleged obscenity case
your honour the police witnesses are the
foundation for jerry griffith appearance
this is relevant and material
because i will show
that the obscene pages
from the jadway book
created the wish to commit rape
within jerry griffith
and then drove him
to act out this wish
mike
so w/i-lat else have i missed
maggie well for one thing you
have no idea of the conflict
going on at the house
over jerry testifying
mike
is he still resisting
i i want to ask you not to put
jerry on the witness stand
before you say anything
let me finish
and i wont say do it for me mike
but for jerry sake alone
please waive your cross-examination
im sorry maggie
but i cant betray
the people whove retained me
the da had his own way so far
and now he plans to prove the
dangerous influence of jadway writing
by hitting us with jeny griffith
now this is our first
opportunity to stop him
maggie but jeny is paralysed with fear
over the cross-examination
he might even try to take
his own life again
but if we dont defend ourselves here
then well go under
and the censors strike another
important blow against free speech
if i had leroux mrs vogler even
a star witness like cassie mcgraw
and you can have her mike
you promise not to cross-examine jerry
and i promise to get you
cassie mcgraw herself
please raise your right hand
you swear to tell the truth and
nothing but the truth
i do
state your name for the record
jerry erm jerome griffith
please be seated
jerry griffith may i ask
what is your present occupation
student
jerry would you mind speaking up
you said
im a student
how long have you been
at the university
almost two years
before this year well let say
during your last year of high school
your first two years of college
how frequently did you go on
dates with girls
it it hard to remember
i cant remember how frequently
well can you give an approximation
of how frequently
objection your honour the witness
has stated that he does not remember
im going to object
on the grounds that
the question has been asked and
answered also it speculative
objection sustained
jerry what is your major
english literature
do your courses demand
considerable reading
say at least three books a week
objection the district attorney
is leading the witness
overruled the witness may
answer the question
thank you your honour ls it a fact that
you read at least three books a week
yes sir
do you also read other books
on your own so to speak
that is books not on the required list
for your english courses
yes sir
have you ever read a book called
the seven minutes by jj jadway
yes sir i have
from cover to cover
every word of it
yes sir
what was your reaction to the book
objection the witness reaction
to the book is highly immaterial
no evidence has been
produced by the prosecution
showing this witness to be
a literary expert
mr griffith reaction is
highly irrelevant speculative
and having nothing whatsoever to do
with the merits of this trial
mr barrett i must warn you against
making speeches for the jury benefit
i find the prosecutor
line of questioning
to be highly probative
and material to the issue
of whether or not
the seven minutes is obscene
the jury is admonished to disregard
defence counsel argument before the court
you may proceed mr duncan
hopefully without any
interruptions from mr barrett
thank you your honour
jerry what was your reaction to
the reading of the seven minutes
i was upset
what do you mean upset
i was mixed up inside all mixed up
i couldnt sleep
did you go to school the next day
yes but i cut some of
my late afternoon classes
why
i had my mind on that book
i kept it in my car
and i drove around for a while
and i found a lonely road
up in the hills
and i re-read parts of the book
can you recall what
sections you re-read
i dont remember exactly
some of the first chapter
the first of the seven minutes
in the story
i read that several times
what was in those pages
i dont remember exactly
if i may refresh your memory
of that part jerry
she is lying naked and she
thinks of the statues of priapus
that stood on some of
the streets of ancient greece
statues consisting of
a bust of a bearded man
set on a stone basalt block
and out of the centre of this statue
there projected a giant phallus
i object to the prosecutor
leading and suggestive reading
pointedly out of context
mr duncan should be
conversant with the fact
that a work whether it be
writing or motion pictures
must be considered as a whole
particularly when the question of
obscenity hangs in the balance
mr barrett my patience is
stretched to the breaking point
the counsel for
the prosecution reading
is clearly and obviously foundational
and will be followed
by a proper question
you will continue reading mr duncan
thank you your honour
and out of the centre of this statue
there projected a giant phallus
and then kathleen thinks
how lucky she is
and she stared at the
unnamed hero of the book
and the first of
her seven minutes begins
now jerry do you recognise that
as the part you re-read several times
yes sir
did you feel at the time
it was artistic writing
i didnt think about the writing
face the court jerry
do you feel the author was trying
nothing more than excite the reader
your honour im sorry
but i must object
to the district attorney constant
leading and suggestive questioning
this examination is
highly inflammatory
and i ask to approach the bench
to discuss the relevance
of this one-sided interrogation
mr barrett i find the prosecutor
questioning to be quite pertinent
the bench will not tolerate
any more interference from you
if you persist youll be held
in contempt of court
now let us proceed with the trial
thank you your honour have the court
reporter repeat the last question
you are instructed to do so
question by mr duncan
loud shuffling of papers
did you feel that the author
was trying to do anything more
than excite the reader
n0
did this passage
and other passages excite you
yes sir
in what way did this
excitement manifest itself
suspenseful music
physically
i wanted to have a girl
you mean you wanted to have
sexual intercourse with a girl
yes sir
with some particular girl
°“s any girl
any girl
what did you do next
it was night time
i drove to the club
and i drank a couple of beers
there was this one chick she looked
just like what i imagined kathleen
elmo kathleen the heroine of
the seven minutes
right anyhow i offered her a ride
by her do you mean sheri moore
right s0 i drove her to her
apartment and walked upstairs
and when she opened the door
i pushed her inside
you did this how
i had a knife
i see did she undress
she was scared so she undressed
what happened next
i dont remember
it went kind of crazy like it wasnt
my own mind any more
like it was jadway mind
please continue jerry
i forced myself on her
did she resist
yes
but you violated her anyway
i didnt know what i was doing
did you think of
the seven minutes at all
when she was naked yes
then i dont remember after that
except that i did it
i couldnt help doing it
and during the course of the sex act
miss moore was injured
it was after
when i was trying to dress
she tried to hit me and get my knife
i dont remember which
and lthink
somehow she slipped and fell
it was an accident
did you know miss moore
was unconscious
i dont remember if i knew it or not
i only knew she had a roommate
who might be coming back soon
so ljust left i felt miserable
i lwanted to kill myself
because this wasnt me
what i had done
it wasnt my fault
i didnt know what i was doing
have you ever in your life
behaved this way before
n0 sir
do you definitely feel the obscene
pages in that book inflamed you
until you were impelled
to commit a criminal act
yes sir i cant explain
any other reason for it
jerry i want you to listen to me
and listen to me carefully
from your own experience do you
believe there a cause and effect
now understand me
cause and effect relationship
between pornographic books
and violent acts of crime
i i only know
only know what happened
it happened to me
choking sobs
no further questions your honour
the defence has no questions
your honour
incredulous hubbub
mr barrett you mean you wish
to reserve your
cross-examination for laten
i mean as far as
the defence is concerned
the witness may be
permanently excused
we will take a two-hour recess
for lunch bangs gavel
hey barrett why didnt you
cross-examine the kid
no comment
have you thrown in the towel
mr barrett
no comment
if you cant stand the heat
get out of the kitchen
was the heat too hot for you
fuck off
clay you still havent answered me
what the hell happened back there
mike i traded off the
cross-examination of jerry griffith
for the examination of
the legendary cassie mcgraw
clay you mean she alive
mike she very much alive
and what more
we have an opportunity to use her
whod she make a deal with
mike maggie russell cassie read
about the trial in the paper
wrote to frank griffith
in defence of jadway
maggie intercepted the postcard
and kept it hidden for two weeks
im gonna see it later today
clay you gotta be kidding
you mean you traded away jerry
for something scrawled on a postcard
something you havent even seen
and what if the whole trade
was a con job
engineered by maggie
on behalf of the griffith family
mike hey ive got faith in maggie
ok man you keep the faith
mike look at the other
side of it man
cassie mcgraw for the defence
would be a sensation
clay when is maggie supposed
to turn over this postcard
mike some time later today
s0 youd better call
the sequence from the start
and to the best of your recollection
you have not omitted any pertinent facts
surrounding your arrest
at the argus book store
by sergeant kellog of
the county sheriffs office
n0 sir
your witness
were you previously arrested
under the terms of the
california penal code section 32
the section stating that everyone who
knowingly distributes obscene material
is guilty of a misdemeanour
yes
did you plead not guilty
n0
did you plead guilty of
selling obscene material
yes but only on the advice
of my attorney
he said if i pleaded guilty
i would get a lighter sentence
but you admitted guilt
yes i did
did you pay a fine
yes
did you go tojail
n0 the sentence was suspended
are you aware
that a second offence
is not a misdemeanour but a felony
yes
are you cognisant of the fact
that you can go to jail for a year
and be fined up to $25000
yes i am
are you aware that the publisher
the sanford house
pandered the seven minutes
with this garish poster
prominently displayed in front
of the argus book store
but there were other quotes
on similar advertising
that described it as
a distinguished work of art
no further questions your honour
when sanford house contracted
for the seven minutes
were you worried about it violating
existing obscenity laws
not really because i considered
the book to be beautiful and touching
it too well done to appeal
to s0meone prurient interest alone
do you consider the book to be beyond
the customary limits of candour
by contemporary community standards
certainly not in fact it
relatively mild by today standards
when you consider that motion pictures
and stage plays offer nudity copulation
oral-genital love masturbation
homosexuality lesbianism
community standards
have radically changed
your witness mr duncan
mr sanford i have before me
news clippings
from the new york times
and the wall street journal
which note the
shaky financial position
of sanford house
in the last two years
are these news accounts
substantially true
yes
elmo in short since you took over
quietly excuse me mr barrett
miss maggie russell wants you
to meet her right away
elmo as it has in the past
did she say where
she said youd know
sanford that depends on what
you mean by doing well
uh it is true that the firm
book sales uh have gone dovlm
elmo perhaps you were
desperate enough
to ignore your fathefis
previous good taste
and tried to save your
position in the firm
by publishing an obscene book
tyres screech
what going on
ive made a real mess of everything
uncle frank heard from yerkes
that we were seeing each other
apparently he known of
our relationship for some time
but my rising to your defence over
jerry well-being flipped him out
he told me to pack up and leave
he took my key
and waited until i was outside on the
front drive before slamming the door
s0 i lugged my things over here
from across the street
and the postcard
from cassie mcgraw
is still in his desk
im sorry
now you had to give up
your key right
the key to the front door yes
but not the one to
the rear service porch
then were just going to
have to sweat him out
because i gotta get my hands
on that postcard
mike my bags
brakes squeal
maggie what time is it
maggie
wait the light went out
there uncle frank
coming out the door
car door shuts
engine starts
in we go
music becomes more dramatic
oh damn it
tyres squeal
get it fast
ill go out in the street
brakes squeal
what the hell are you
doing in my driveway
you could have got us both killed
look sir im sorry i came by
to see miss russell and
well miss russell
doesnt live here any more
now you get your
lousy crate out of my driveway
i oughta put guys like you away
you son of a bitch
what the hell are you doing here
spying on me and my son
come on get out of the car
and say something you bastard
youre not in court now
oh id really like to clobber you
but youre not suckering me into that
now you get your ass outta here
if youre still snooping around
after ive parked my car
im gonna kick
the living hell out of you
then ill turn you over
to the cops for prowling
how does that grab ya
both engines start
tyres squeal
maggie gasps
that was a close call
mike let get the hell out of here
before i get my ass kicked
tyres squeal
well
it beautiful
if cassie mcgraw backs up in court
what she says in this postcard
the defence finally
has a star witness
now where can i take you before
i catch the next plane to chicago
i was hoping youd take me home
home
with you
lush romantic music
if jadway were alive today
hed be in his late 50s or early 60s
this woman is at least
5 or 20 years older
like all the old people
in this sanitarium
i never think of katie
in terms of years
that reminds me of something
as long as ive been here
and that going on five years
katie been getting flowers
once a year always on her birthday
who sends cassie the flowers
i dont know
theyre wired from ryan flowers
in oakwood california
phone rings
hello
hi maggie
mike i was praying it would be you
have you heard
i mean about sheri moore
she died in her sleep
yeah ljust finished
reading the story
are things any better in chicago
it couldnt be worse
cassie mcgraw will never speak
on the witness stand
the poor woman senile
what a lousy break
she has moments when she lucid
like when she wrote the postcard
but today wasnt one of them
im awfully sorry mike
all that trouble for nothing
chicago may not be a total loss
how do you mean
she receives roses every year
on her birthday
a standing order from ryan flowers
i called clay he gonna check on it
first thing tomorrow
mike i might be able to help you
when i was working as
frank griffith secretary
we dealt exclusively with that florist
s0
why dont you let me get in touch
with them id love to help
miss cumberland ill bet youre
wondering why im here
yes as a matter of fact i am
well the griffiths have
a lot to do with it
im terribly concerned
about jerry griffith
you know the boy who involved
in the obscenity trial
yes i watched it on
the news last night
it might sound strange to you
but one of my good friends
and i trust him implicitly
is michael barrett
the defence attorney in the case
he a very attractive
young man indeed
he genuinely believes that jadway
the seven minutes is not obscene
anyway he been racing all over
the country trying to find witnesses
who knew jadway or who
had some insight into his motives
he just visited with
cassie mcgraw in chicago
oh really
youre familiar with ryan flowers
well yes
mike asked me to check their records
did he
i was surprised to learn that
for the past ten years
you have been paying for
cassie mcgraw birthday flowers
how enterprising of you
how well did you know cassie mcgraw
cassie mcg raw was my private secretary
when i lived and worked in paris
ooh 35 years ago at that time
she was my only friend
very few people know about cassie
or about any of my life
at the time for that matter
much of it was not terribly pleasant
through the years
ive managed to keep it concealed
but why
you know of my longstanding
friendship with the griffiths
especially frank late wife
it was difficult to hide my contempt
of his behaviour toward his son jerry
now it my turn
to stand up and be counted
raunchy va-va-voom music
thank you baby doll
it in the bag we dont even need
the chippie creaking
elmo cant buy that newspaper
and the tv exposure
it also opens up
a whole new can of peas
we now have a case
of murder one as well
were gonna anticipate
a probability factor
of at least 90% for conviction
whose jerry
i think the griffith name
has been muck-raked enough
oh relax frank
it not your boy that on trial
it that obscene book
together with that ben fremont
that purveyor of filth
the slut death is just
icing on the cake
frankly i am more than
a little bit concerned
at the turn of events
it a brand new ball game
with sheri moore death
well if it any consolation
there the closing argument
mike dictated about four this morning
let pick up on it
it might give us a shot in the arm
mike supreme court justice douglas
once said
the idea of using censors to bar
thoughts of sex is dangerous
a person without sex thoughts
is abnormal
sex thoughts may
induce sex practices that
make for better
marital relations
sex thoughts that
make love more atiractive
certainly should not be outlawed
lf the illicit is included
that should make
no constitutional difference
your honour i call
constance cumberland to the stand
gasps of astonishment
please raise your right hand
do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth and nothing
but the truth so help you god
i do
state your name for the record
constance cumberland
please be seated
miss cumberland
what is your present occupation
im an actress i have been
an actress for some 35 years
in motion pictures
and most recently on television
how do you occupy yourself
away from camera
well if you mean
what organisations do i belong to
im a working member
of the league for women voters
the reiss-davis centre
for emotionally disturbed children
and occasionally
ive given my public support
to the
strength through decency league
because like anyone else
with concern about today society
im against pornography
mainly because of the way
it appeals to the young people
who arent mature enough
to understand its implications
did you ever write
and publish any books
i did
were they works of fiction
some sceptics probably
suggested as much
laughter
but i consider my autobiography
to be a work of complete truth
what i mean is everything
that i published was honest
that doesnt mean
i published everything
laughter
are you acquainted with
the classical and modern fiction
as a reader yes i am
classical and modern
and also as an actress
i wouldnt want to bore the court
with my credits but
have you ever read a novel
entitled the seven minutes
by jj jadway
i have sir
have you read it more than once
ive read it many many times
how recently have you read
the book in its entirety
as recently as last night
are you familiar with section 32
of the california penal code
iam
do you know that the seven minutes
is being charged as obscene matter
under that section of the code
i do know that
do you consider the seven minutes
to be an obscene book
just a moment miss cumberland
your honour i object
to defence counsel question
no foundation has been
laid to establish
miss cumberland qualifications
to render such an opinion
with all due respect
to the acting abilities
and other impressive credentials
possessed by miss cumberland
i cannot imagine what bearing
her opinion on the merits of this book
could possibly have
upon the proceedings
your honour i would like
to approach the bench
both attorneys shall
approach the bench
mr barrett im concerned with your
examination of miss cumberland
it appears you are seeking
to elicit from this witness
an opinion which
she is not entitled to give
mr duncan has properly interposed an
objection which i mean to sustain
your honour if i may interrupt
forjust a moment
i assure you that
miss cumberland testimony
is critical to the defence case
i can
your honour i feel defence counsel
is testing the court patience
let him who is without sin
cast the first stone
dont you come on strong with me
gentlemen will you restrain
yourselves from this bickering
now mr barrett
i have the greatest admiration
for miss cumberland as an actress
but i fail to see what credentials
she possesses which enables her
to render an opinion concerning
the seven minutes unless
she is a qualified literary expert
and apparently she is not because
you have not qualified her as such
therefore she cannot give
an expert opinion
your honour it is very
just a moment mr duncan
i want to hear from the defence
i represent to you
as an officer of the court
that you will find this testimony
to be extremely relevant
and material to the def
let him make an offer of proof as to
the nature of this so-called material
do you have an offer of proof to make
your honour if im forced to make
an offer of proof at this time
the court is requiring me to disclose
my defence to the prosecution
in violation of my client
constitutional rights
this i respectfully refuse to do
if the court will just bear with me
permit me a few more questions
youll readily see the relevance
all right all right
but im warning you mr barrett
if the testimony in fact
is inadmissible
or highly prejudicial
to the prosecution
i will take strong measures
to deal with this
your honour may l
not at this time mr duncan
if the evidence is not
relevant and material
you may move to strike the testimony
at the appropriate time
now let proceed
miss cumberland do you
consider the seven minutes
to be an obscene book
no i do not i consider it
to be a highly moral book
do you believe the author of this work
was pandering to prurient interest
to a shameful or morbid interest
in nudity and sex
in writing this book
as the state charges
to which i object on the grounds
that this witness
is not qualified
to answer the question
mr duncan i believe your objection to
be well taken but the court believes
that the defence is entitled to
some leeway in this area
objection overruled
mr barrett will you please
reframe the question
miss cumberland do you believe
the author was in fact pandering
to a shameful and morbid interest
in nudity and sex
i know for a fact that that author was
not pandering to prurient interest
your honour i move to
strike from the record
miss cumberland conclusion and
conjecture that the author
was not in fact pandering
to prurient interest
obviously this witness could
have no personal knowledge
of the authofis true intentions
mr barrett i indicated that
i would give you leeway
however if you dont immediately
get to your point
the court will sustain its own
objection to your questions
very well your honour i will proceed
directly to the point
miss cumberland you stated that
the book the seven minutes
was not in fact written
to appeal to prurient interest
may i enquire how do you know
because im intimatedly acquainted
with the circumstances surrounding
the creation and the publication
of the seven minutes
excited murmuring
gavel banging repeatedly
judge miss cumberland will you
explain to the jurors and the court
how you came by
this intimate knowledge
gladly
no person alive was closer or better
acquainted with jj jadway than i am
miss cumberland are you implying
that you were present in paris
when jj jadway wrote
the seven minutes
im saying that lwas in paris
when the book was written
do you know the author
motivations for writing it
to which i object the question
calls for conclusion and speculation
miss cumberland could not possibly
have any personal knowledge
of the authofis true motivations
for writing the seven minutes
mr duncan we are getting on with this
matter if it the last thing we do
you will recall the court asked miss
cumberland to explain to thejury
how she has intimate knowledge
of the circumstances
under which the seven minutes
was written
now the court will not tolerate
any more interference
of mr barrett questioning
along these lines
objection overruled
mr barrett will you proceed
and ask another question
thank you your honour
miss cumberland you are familiar
with the prosecution testimony
does this first-hand knowledge
which you possess
confirm or contradict the testimony
given here by the people witnesses
my information about the real jadway
and the real purpose in writing
and publishing this book
completely contradicts the evidence
so far presented in this court
you do understand that the
previous witnesses were sworn
gave their testimony under oath
and risked facing a charge of
perjury if they lied
they did not lie
they simply did not tell the truth
merely because they were ignorant
of the truth let me explain
everything heard in this courtroom
until now about jj jadway
and i am completely fluent
with all of the testimony
has been the purest fiction
and this fiction was deliberately
planned and perpetrated by the author
for reasons involving
the author private life
let me go directly
to the salient point at hand
you indicated in earlier testimony
that you had published
your own autobiography which
was a best-seller as i recall
have you ever written or published
any other books
yes i have
how many other books
one book
was this book published under the name
of constance cumberland
no it was not it was
published under a pseudonym
suspenseful music
can you tell the court
the title of that book
and the pseudonym
under which you wrote it
the book was the seven minutes
gasps of astonishment
by jj jadway
hubbub in court
i am jj jadway
pencil snaps loudly
dramatic music
gavel banging
order in court order order
miss cumberland the court has already
heard the seven minutes read aloud
s0 we might more clearly
determine the significance
of what we have already heard
would you mind telling us
the themes and symbols that you
tried to convey in writing the book
may i have a glass of water please
thank you
clock ticking loudly
the seven minutes is composed
of seven chapters
each chapter representing one minute
in the mind of
this young woman kathleen
who is lying on a bed
having sexual intercourse
with an unnamed unseen man
it begins with a description
of her thoughts and feelings
for her male bed partner
kathleen mind reacts
to the coupling on two levels
on the first she records
her immediate physical sensations
and on the second inspired
by her gradually mounting passion
she recollects fragments of sensual
experiences from her youthful past
with three actual men in her life
who had been her lovers
the thrust of the novel
is drawn out of the fact
that kathleen decides to accept one of
these men as her lifetime mate
the one she had taken
to her bed this night
the very one who shares
her seven minutes
not till the last page while
she is gasping her love for him
in the final throes of her passion
does she call out and reveal the name
of the one she has chosen
you see through her vast
sexual experience she has managed
to liberate a sensitive
but potentially impotent man
the man she honestly loved
in writing the seven minutes
i finally found freedom myself
just as i had hoped
i might liberate others
from fear and guilt and shame
do you know of any other readers for
which it has performed this service
the words in the seven minutes
freed a young man only today
and enabled him to confide to me
the truth about himself
a truth he has told no other person
until now
jerry griffith was not driven to
commit rape by reading this book
he did not try to violate
sheri moore against her will
he tried but at
sheri own invitation
but he failed then
as he had always failed before
and as he would fail today
because you see jerry griffith
was then was before and even today
is still sexually impotent
he is incapable of
attaining an erection
miss cumberland did the verdict
for acquittal surprise you
what surprised me more
was the very fact
that i was able to
reveal myself in court
there was testimony about
your supposed suicide
you look pretty good to me right now
so obviously youre alive and kicking
did you ever really try
to kill yourself
constance well that whole
incredible story
was arranged by
a poet friend of mine
a loyal and dear friend
named sean oflanagan
it was simple enough for him to write
and plant the obituary of jj jadway
cassie mcgraw arranged a private
memorial service for jadway
i found it wiser to be somewhere else
miss cumberland what made you decide
to renounce the jadway identity
well i had an offer
from a hollywood producer
someone i had met in paris
to appear in the go/d-diggers of 938
anyway i went to hollywood
made gold-diggers
and you know the rest
maggie laughing
be nice you won
ill be right back
oh mr barrett
i dont know if you heard me
with all the noise after the verdict
but i did congratulate you
i appreciate that sir
you won the preliminary
you got the seven minutes off the hook
but the main event
is still murder one
and i intend to prosecute perkins
to the full limit of the law
jerry griffith has a debt as well
as an accomplice he shares
the responsibility for the crime
he wont run from that
when he has his day in court
ill be standing right next to him
you proved that one of
my witnesses perjured himself
and that another one unwittingly lied
but you didnt prove
at least not to me
that this filthy book
belongs in a decent household
and jadway or cumberland
i still believe the seven minutes
is obscene and harmful
and should have been found guilty
and as for the author
of that perverted book
constance cumberland stands
as a black stain on our society
well youre entitled
to your opinion
barrett such books are dangerous
and should not be published
because they can hurt
immature and disturbed adults
even worse
they can over-stimulate a child
before he ready to accept
his sex thoughts as natural
and drive him into
damaging sexual fantasies
in other words mr duncan
all literature and all ideas
should be aimed at satisfying
the twelve-year-old reader
youre a pitiful hypocrite
and a political opportunist to boot
you spout your clever rhetoric
about god mother and country
and yet you connive and scheme
without regard to anyone but yourself
it amazes me that an intelligent man
cannot direct his energies
into what is good for the community
he supposed to protect
instead he spends his time
racing off to court
seeking a ban on those things
he arbitrarily feels is bad for us
youve got your goddamn nerve
you win one lousy case
you think youre f lee bailey
let me tell you one thing
as long as there are books
like the seven minutes
or anything else i feel jeopardises
the moral fibre of this community
ill keep fighting them
tyres squeal
fair warning
but as long as you keep
strong-arming yourself ahead
ill be fighting you
mike maggie if you knew all along
about jerry sexual problem
if you knew he was
incapable of rape
why the hell didnt you
say something
because i wasnt all that certain
that he was impotent
on the night of the sa-cal/ed rape
mike where did jerry and
miss cumberland finally get together
maggie in your house yesterday
while you were still in chicago
i took the chance
of pretending to him
that i knew the truth about
his night with sheri moore
at that point jerry broke down
and confessed everything
miss cumberland was really touched
she said if she could persuade jerry
to stand up and confess the truth
then she herself might find the
courage to do the same in court
maggie youre beautiful
just beautiful
listen if youre really so grateful
how about a little
victory celebration
you know i dont drink
anything stronger than coke
and i also know youve given up
cigarettes and cyclamates
because youre only thirty
and want to live to be a hundred
i was thinking of
something a lot healthier
car engine revs up
to michael barrett
i salute you on your deserved victory
and i recommend that you
enjoy this vintage wine
in the spirit that it is given
beware of greeks bearing gifts
l also recommend to you
the wisdom of charles lamb
to wit he is
no lawyer who cannot take two sides
when you have time
i would like to interest you in
my side of the coin
you could find it
extremely profitable
who knows you could be
senatorial material
best luther yerkes
luther yerkes
young lady
i feel it only fair to tell you
that what im thinking about doing
is against the law
and what are you thinking about doing
i cant tell you that
it against the law too
suddenly i got this overpowering urge
to break the damn law myself
well we could both get into
a lot of trouble
i know a very good lawyer
aside from notoriety what else
do you want out of my life
would you believe
the next seven minutes
clock ticking
soft rock ballad
seven minutes
filled with pleasure
moments made of love
will take you
on a sweet excursion
by wayof
your memory
suddenly you find
you cross the boundfies
that were once forbidden
aii at once you have
a better view
of the morning
you in the morning
you in the morning

﻿
once upon a time
there was a king named william
who ruled a large and mighty kingdom
and yet he was sad
for he was growing old and had
no child to inherit the throne
then happily a daughter was born
a princess
and she was given the name odette
kings and queens came from all around
to offer their gifts to the child
among them was the widow uberta
and her young son prince derek
it was then that william and
uberta happened upon the same idea
derek and odette would be brought together each
summer in hopes that they would fall in love
and join their kingdoms forever
but unknown to all was another plan
that of the evil enchanter rothbart
odette birth was of
little concern to him
for he was preparing to
take william kingdom
by means of the forbidden arts
on the eve of his
assault william attacked
and rothbart powers were
plunged into darkness
despite calls for his death
the enchanter was only banished
im not finished with you yet william
someday ill get my power back
and when i do everything you
own everything you love
will be mine
many feared king william too kind
but in time the threat was forgotten
and all hopes turned to
that not-too-distant summer
when derek and odette would meet
here they come oh
dear uberta as lovely as ever
oh a nest heh-heh
and who might this strapping young man be
young prince derek no doubt
welcome to our fair kingdom dear william
and to you young princess
go on derek
dear go on
mother
derek
hello princess odette
im very pleased to meet you
pleased to meet you prince derek
ah ah ah
yuck
i cant believe im stuck with her all summer
ill bet she doesnt wrestle hunt or box
he looks conceited
what a total bummer
if i get lucky ill get chickenpox
so happy you could come
so happy to be here
how id like to run
this is not my idea
this isnt my idea
of fun
the children seem to get along quite nicely
well join our lands if this arrangement clicks
my dear king william
that my point precisely
it such good parenting
and politics
so happy we agree
i think weve got a deal
derek quite a catch
this is my idea
of a match
heh-heh and such fun
good heavens child dont dawdle
we cant keep derek waiting
i havent packed or washed my hair
and father i get seasick
they soon will be arriving
is that respect youre showing
if you make me kiss her hand again
i swear im gonna be sick
one day prince derek will be her intended
heh-heh splendid
weve tried all summer
but we just cant lose her
hey fellas wait up
quick put on some speed
when picking teams
or friends
id never choose her
youd think shed take a hint and learn to read
this really isnt fair
we really couldnt care
boys it all or none
this is not my idea
this isnt my idea
of fun
long before they met
derek and odette
were destined to be wedded
however anyone could see
the only point on which they didnt disagree
was that the very thought of summertime
was dreaded
she tries to talk me into playing dress-up
she always flirting with the castle guards
i think you really sort of like her fess up
id like her better if shed lose at cards
four sevens and a 0
i think ive won again
every time she won
this is my idea of fun
this isnt my idea of fun
we need a royal wedding
id love to be invited
at least wed get a holiday
to rest our plows and axes
someday these two will marry
two lands will be united
and with some luck their marriage
may result in lower taxes
what if odette doesnt go for the merger
urge her
for as long as i remember
weve been told wed someday wed
every june until september
all their pushing and annoying hints
ive got bruises with their fingerprints
i can do much better i am sure
he so immature
i see him smiling and my knees start buckling
i see inside him and my doubts are gone
she started out as such an ugly duckling
and somehow suddenly became a swan
so happy to be here
till now i never knew
it is you ive been dreaming of
this is my idea
this is my idea
what a good idea
such a charming and romantic notion
this is my idea such a good idea
such a powerful and magic potion
this is exactly my idea
of love
this is my idea
this is my idea
this is my idea
of love
arrange the marriage
wait
what youre all i ever wanted
youre beautiful
thank you but what else
what else
is beauty all that matters to you
derek
what else
i uh
what else is there
we tried uberta
no one can say we didnt try
say goodbye odette
goodbye
goodbye
prince derek
mother
derek
goodbye princess
all these years of planning
wasted
what else is there she says
is beauty all that matters
and you say what else is there
it was dumb i know
you should write a book how to offend
women in five syllables or less
heh-heh your turn prince derek
i didnt know what else to say
you lost your queen derek
that twice in one day
think you must see something
other than odette beauty
ha of course i do rogers she like
you know and how about
and then
i mean right
i dont know how to say it
ill prove it to her
ill prove my love checkmate
huh

and when the moonlight touches your wings
now look odette this sort of thing
doesnt give me any pleasure
well maybe a teensy bit
but what i really want
is your father kingdom
take it then you have enough power
nah tried that already
once you steal something
you spend your whole life fighting to keep it
but if i marry the only
heir to the throne
well rule your father kingdom together legally
king and queen you know
never
where are you going
as soon as moonlight leaves the lake
youll turn back into a swan
no matter where you are
the musicians are not happy

give her up without a fight

this masquerade
is more than i can bear

i got it water leaks
into the dungeon right
well if there a leak
there must be a hole
well find the hole make it bigger and
she loose heh-heh
i think youre forgetting two things
his majesty got a point
not to worry now first we need a scout
are you crazy
who going to jump into this moat
he got to be a good swimmer
i should say so
he gotta be small too
teeny-weeny not to be seen
and it wouldnt hurt if he was green
for camouflage purposes
precisely small good swimmer green--
good grief youre talking about me
youre off on a mission
youre tough in good condition
a hero warts and all
no fear
oh thank you
i know some of you just abhor beauty pageants
but having been a puff-puff girl myself
way back in 39 i just couldnt resist
girls and a one a two
a one two three
beauty and glamour and breeding
are matched
princesses on parade
lovely enthralling and all unattached
the hoi polloi and those well-bred agree
each enjoy a royal pedigree
born for success
each possesses a spark
each a remarkable maid
boy oh boy these royal highnesses
all have plusses theyve no minuses
gaze upon
these princesses on parade
this princess comes from colchester
where corn and cotton grows
she plays croquet and harpsichord
and sews her own clothes
antonia isnt known to take
the path of least resistance
she hails from southeast harristan
and came the farthest distance
griselda lives to help the world
she finds no task too menial
and all the other hopeful girls think
she the most congenial
brunhilde is from stuttgart
where our swords and armor made
gaze upon
princesses on parade
this is the likely occasion
when the heir to the throne picks a wife
this may be the day
that prince derek will say
where have you been all my life
brilliant beguiling
a smiling brigade
princesses on parade
each the pride of her community
each a golden opportunity
just the thought that crown prince derek
will face this choice and he hysterical

letter from a friend
three dead in dalarna
hello again edward
does this place
get many visitors
this is the only way
to get here
did you check it for
footprints and tire tracks
three days ago i walked
the river both sides
let check again
rounds
i prepared two kinds
0 jacketed 0 expanding
id like 20 of each
and 0 explosive
not a problem
will mercury do
mercury will do
very nicely
i brought my own target
right there
muzzle velocity
about 360 miles an hour
that including 20 miles an hour
off for the sound suppression
ruger
m4
ive not had one before
youll find it easy
ive re-balanced it for the
weight of the suppressor
the fulcrum two centimeters
forward from the grip
but that shouldnt matter
if youre firing
im assuming you are
from a fixed position
there no major
recoil issues
you should be able to hold
any target even the smallest
go to the flower
fire into these reeds
say two steps
away from me
two bursts
five seconds apart
the sound suppression
is superb
i couldnt place
the direction of fire
i shall require the rounds and the
weapon by the first of next month
in the meantime
could you tighten the
adjusting screws on the sight
theyre too loose
what about the case
it a briefcase samsonite
black combination locks
you have a number
you prefer
what do you want
done with these
how thoughtful
asprinio
i dont know it
it like moscato
only frizzante
it wouldnt look right
if the picnic wasnt touched
you chilled the wine
i thought
had to be chilled
italian cops
dont move

good morning
buongiorno
youre up early
i needed some air
i walk here to meditate
i thank god for certain
favors he has granted me
and i ask him to look after those
of my friends who are sinners
all men are sinners
some are greater sinners
than others
but those who seek peace
have much sinning
in their history
maybe
forgive me this is the
priest in me speaking but
you have done much
sinning signor clarke
and you still do
something happened
here last night
everything ive done
ive had good cause to do
do you wish to tell me
to confess
yes
for what reason
for your own sake
perhaps i can
pray for you
perhaps
i wonder how many bastards
have been made here
you work in metal
you were given some steel
by fabio the car doctor
where was he
conceived father
fabio the car doctor
why do you ask me that
you have each other photos
you have each other eyes
was he conceived here under the trees
at night like all the other bastards
i do not remember signore
it was many years ago
in the end it is i
who confesses to you
do you want me
to do the same
for your own good
you cannot doubt the
existence of hell you live in it
it is a place without love
perhaps i have no right
to wear these robes
but i do have a heart
full of a father love
something close
to his heart
and for that i am
both grateful and happy
what do you have
my friend

what are you offering
a financial opportunity
let me explain
in this envelope there is a key
ill show you
this key opens the glass dome
to the button unit
voilà
now if you push the button
two things will happen
first someone somewhere in the world
whom you dont know
will die
second
you will receive a payment
of  million dollars
tax-free
the payment will be delivered to you
by me
in cash
just as you see here
oh and mrs lewis please permit me
to present to you this crisp
00-dollar bill as a gift
in exchange for your kindness
in allowing me into your home
norma youre gonna give me
this 00-dollar bill
even if i say no
that is correct
are you for real
oh i assure you mrs lewis
this offer is quite real
well who do you work for
guarantee of payment
comes with three restrictions im afraid
one i am not permitted
to disclose any information
about the identity of my employers
two you are not permitted
to discuss the details of this with anyone
except your husband of course
three you have 24 hours
you have until 500 tomorrow
to make your decision
at which point
i shall return
and retrieve the button unit
it will be reprogrammed
and the offer will be made
to someone else
it been a pleasure meeting you
mrs lewis
it a new prosthesis for her foot
you got it
but im using
the new ge silastic polymer
theyre developing for the pilot chairs
for the shuttle
wendell nice pal
thank you
hey what happened to her foot
when she was 7
her brother dropped a barbell on her foot
she thinks one of her toes is broken
so she goes to the hospital
the doctor sets her in a chair
turns the x-ray machine on
then goes to check on another
patient down the hall
and he forgets all about norma
leaves the x-ray machine running
oh jesus that
that not good
no
the tissue in four of her toes
was completely destroyed by the radiation
they had to amputate four of her toes
yep then they had to go in
and get skin from her inner thigh
to cover the front of her foot
this is back in 958 so they didnt
have the skin-graft techniques they do now
and she had to sit like this
the same position
full body cast for a month
waiting for it to heal
jesus i hope she sued this idiot
oh yeah her family sued and they won
what was the settlement
ten thousand dollars
if this sucker works
she can start jogging again
wendell

58 million miles in about five minutes

dana dana
man on tv the first picture you saw
which included the footpads
took about five minutes
to take on mars
and then it is transmitted
by a relay radio up to the orbiter
july 20 969
we received a transmission
from the moon telling us
the eagle has landed
today landing like that one
represents the realization of a dream
that has long excited
mankind imagination
and this mission offers the possibility
of a momentous discovery
in the history of mankind
the existence of life
elsewhere in the universe
if the experiments ofvikings  and 2
do not reveal living organisms
they will learn other secrets
of the universe
they will tell us a good many things
about our own planet
opening up new possibilities
for exploration
and should produce knowledge
that will improve the quality of life
right here on earth
our achievements in space represent
not only the height of technological skill
they also reflect the best
in our country
our character
the capacity for creativity and sacrifice
and a willingness
to reach into the unknown
norma

indistinguishable from magic
lightning strikes the earth
00 times per second
a single bolt of lightning
can reach temperatures
approaching 28000 degrees celsius
in a split second
this is five times hotter
than the surface of the sun
is that what happened to you
you were struck by lightning
yes
and now i am in communication
with those who control the lightning
and what lies behind the other two
eternal damnation
right
what the emotion you felt
when you first laid eyes on me norma
i felt
you felt what
i felt
pity
love
you felt love for me
yes
why
because of my disfigurement
because of all of the pain
that it ever caused me in my life
i thought what it would be like
to have all of that pain
magnified and projected
onto my face
and if i refuse
eternal damnation
you have chosen gateway number 2
i saw that pain on your face and i just
i understood it
i felt an overwhelming
feeling of love for you
because i knew that i would never
feel sorry for myself ever again
take my hand norma
walter you dont remember
coming home do you
you came in your car
you walked in the door like a zombie
you didnt say anything
you just went straight up to bed
where did all this water come from
why isnt dad telling us what happened
walter
go down to the basement
and get me more buckets
but i just want
walter
fine
can you tell me what happened
i need a drink
walter
are we still going to the wedding
norma
yeah
there is only so much information
that i can disclose
i understand
in the hours following
the first viking transmission from mars
your colleague arlington steward
was struck by lightning
while standing here on this platform
yes and we havent
heard from him since then
he something else now
norm
what do you mean
teague arlington steward died shortly
after being admitted to the burn unit
at riverside hospital
several hours after his body
was taken to the morgue
and locked in a freezer storage unit
a nurse heard a voice
coming from behind a metal door
it was a man laughing
mr steward had come back from the dead
and he was laughing hysterically
he was then transferred
to a high-security military hospital
soon after we realized he was
demonstrating
some extraordinary capabilities
what do you mean by capabilities
his body healed at a rate
0 times faster than normal
cellular degeneration essentially halted
thunder crashes
man over speaker ladies and
gentlemen mr and mrs edward powell
jazzy music playing
over speakers
hi
you cant drink too much now all right
all right
sir if you dont mind
my asking
why a box
your home is a box
your car is a box on wheels
you drive to work in it
you drive home in it
you sit in your home staring into a box
it erodes your soul
while the box that is your body
inevitably withers then dies
whereupon it is placed in the
ultimate box to slowly decompose
it quite depressing
when you think of it that way
dont think of it that way
think of it as a temporary state of being
what happens
once youve completed your tests
i submit the data to my employers
and then your fate rests in their hands
one cannot say they are not without
a bizarre sense of humor
look at me
i wouldnt know sir
of whom it is that you speak
your employers
remain a mystery to us all
i like mystery
dont you
how do we pass the test
steward isnt it obvious
simply dont press the button
if enough of you dont
the test will conclude
but there will be more tests to come
man
walk directly into the light
do not turn back
under any circumstances
when you walk into the light youre gonna
feel your body submerged in a liquid
try to hold your breath
if you feel a drowning sensation
it will pass
where are you sending them
to prepare for the next test
in massachusetts
you spoke earlier
about the altruism coefficient
if human beings are unable or unwilling
to sacrifice individual desires
for the greater good of your species
you will have no chance for survival
and my employers will be compelled
to expedite your extinction
clear
yes sir
scott walker when joanna
loved me playing over speakers
i was gone norma
i was gone for nearly an hour
what did you see
well what was there in the light
words cant describe it
it a place
neither here nor there
but somewhere in between
it a warm embrace
a place where the sidewalk ends
and despair is no longer
the governor of the human heart
dad what going on
im gonna be sick walter
you can still save yourself
it too late for me
but you can still save yourself
jeffrey carnes
boy do i got a lot of questions for you
if you want to survive this thing
youll come with me right now
all right why dont you put the gun
down before someone sees you
get in the truck
all right
walter
dad
norma
walter
walter dad

test subjects
cannot be treated like employees
frontal lobe hemorrhage
that his weakness
he hasnt figured out how to get
in their heads without them noticing
the nosebleeds
you see lots of them
yeah
and so there limits
to what it can do it fallible
living inside a 70-year-old man
yeah that why it embedded itself
at langley
it got everything it needs
military cia fbi nasa
so he can be killed
yes
man on radio the existence oflife
elsewhere in the universe
where are we going

just like it took my daughter

what do you mean
you did it for your daughter
i had to make a choice
between my wife and my daughter
whoa

of ourviking mission
and to reflect on ourjourney
into the unknown
woman speaking indistinctly
over police radio
was there anyone in the truck with him
not that we saw
man
let move
all teams execute
bravo charlie forward position
weapons tight
move move move
arthur arthur listen to me whatever
happens to you from this point on
will have greater ramifications
than you can possibly fathom
please have a seat
where our son
he in a safe place
well get to him in a moment
please sit down
i want you to know
that i have the deepest respect
and admiration for you both
you gave me hope
but i am very sorry
that you pushed the button
im afraid i have to tell you
that two of your son
functional senses have been impaired
he can no longer see
and he can no longer hear
where is he
what have you done with him
i have done nothing with him
i am just a vessel
you are now presented with two options
option one
you can live the rest of your lives
and enjoy the money
that has been given to you
and learn to live with your son
permanent impairment
it is irreversible
he will never hear your voices
or see your faces again
option two
there is one bullet
in the chamber of this gun

move column of troops
where is charles stuart
beverley the king is where you
and traitors like you
will never find him
hmm
in the name of cromwell
i arrest you
for conspiracy against the state
bring him inside
close the doors
why did beverley
call judd a traitor
when youve been in the troop
a little longer my friend
youll learn that our beloved colonel
fights with the hand that pays him best
cant say i blame him
youd better search the house wyatt
detail six men to help you
beautiful quite beautiful
your daughter is it not
colonel beverley
hmm
well now are you going to
tell me what i want to know
if you dont youll die
so will she
only more slowly
tell me where i can find the king
and youll both be granted
a free pardon
im waiting
what your answer
my answer is simple
i commend you and the
murdering despot cromwell
who is your master
to the bottomless pit of hell
where you will surely go
long live the king
thank you edward beverley
and you philip
may god be with you always
i want to remind you gentlemen
that this district is the core
of the strongest royalist resistance
in the country
it is my duty to stamp it out
we are to remain here
until the last royalist is hanged
all right that all
captain sylvester our operations
for the following week
will be for troop a
to cover this area here
troop b here troop c here
troop d to remain at
headquarters in reserve
and charles stuart sir
issue a proclamation
cryer hear ye
hear ye
hear ye
to whoever shall bring
information to the state
leading to the apprehension
of the traitor charles stuart
the state offers a reward
of one hundred guineas
and to whoever shall
withhold such information
the penalty is death
you say you recognised
charles stuart
how
well er begging your pardon
your honour
it was the man who was with him
that gave me the er inkling
as you might say
calling him sire
and your majesty
lieutenant hawke
sir
take a troop to the coast road
yes sir
all right you can go
er your honour ah
begging your pardon your honour
well
i performed my duty as a loyal citizen
yes
ah there the small question
of the reward
what about it
well er when will it
please your honour
to permit me to collect it
if your information leads us
to charles stuart
youre entitled to your reward
ah thank you your honour
itll be presented to you
in public
oh your honour please
not in public
why not pray
well the people
theyd kill me
many of them are misguided enough
to retain allegiance to the king
i i mean the
the traitor charles stuart
if they so much as suspect
what ive done
i shall need protection
youll get your protection
thank you your honour
captain sylvester make arrangements
for this man to be
confined in the village jail
indefinitely
but your honour
no-onell get at you there
captain sylvester
sir
please show him out will you
yes sir
your honour i
take him away
if our friend information
should prove false
you may hang him
it will be a pleasure
i like a man to be
paid in his own coin
yes indeed
if i had my way with traitors id
you were saying
it was of no consequence
dont confuse a collaborator
with a so-called traitor
one is a snivelling coward
seeking to enrich himself
or to save his own skin
the other may find himself
ideologically disposed to change sides
do you understand
every man has a reason
for switching his allegiance
only he can adjust
the rights and wrongs of the matter
to his own conscience
my daughterll be arriving
in a minute
shell be staying here at the manor
youd better go and expound
some of your
admirable philosophy to her
and how is my beautiful clare
im well thank you tom
my father
oh he his usual shall we say
im worried about him
oh
his reputation is spreading
over the whole country
everywhere he goes he leaves
a trail of hatred behind him
well he waiting for you now anyway
wait tom
yes
where colonel beverley
youd better ask your father
arent you still in his confidence
oh yes im very much
the blue-eyed boy
in fact it may interest you to know
he now looks upon me
in the role of
son-in-law
at least that the impression he gives
that a pity
oh why
i dont enjoy disappointing people
not even your father
not even my father
judd clare
sylvester please excuse us
corporal
did you make your journey
to see me
or to ask after the health
of an enemy of the state
colonel beverley only crime
was one of loyalty to his king
oh very touching tribute
to his memory
his only crime as you put it was
sufficient to sign his death warrant
you didnt lose much time
did you father
my duty lies in
the service of cromwell
your duty
when you first changed sides
i tried to push your ignoble actions
to the back of my mind
i tried to delude myself
that you had some reason
other than greed for what you did
but now
now i see you very clearly
a traitor a murderer
cringing to master cromwell for a favour
or a crumb from his table
how dare you speak to me like that
now you listen to me
carefully clare
cromwell has appointed me
officer in charge of the district
chief intendant of the forest
and magistrate
i intend to exercise
those powers to the utmost
in the service of the lord protector
who recognises my ability
if i have forgotten
that i was once a royalist
it is because i now believe
in the new order
and whether you
believe in it or not
you will conform
do you understand me
yes father
i understand you
sylvester colonel
we have a very special guest
get him to hampton court
see to it
sylvester and the other two
shoot them
take him away
bring the other two to
the stable yard wait for me

right turn
prepare to load load
take aim
fire
what happened
father dead

colonel judd yes
and the king been taken
as far as the roundheads

the service of colonel judd
so for the time being
he can come and go as he pleases
jacob youll bring us
whatever information you can
disposition of troops
movement of transport and officials
well hit them wherever we can
with bullets fire and steel
these are not haphazard raids
theyre skilfully designed
and executed
but by whom
well
the man youre looking for sir
is known as the scarlet blade
but you wont find anyone
in the district to betray him
you had better look to yourselves
they are taking more people
for questioning
officer
squad halt stand at ease

parsons

john drury
didnt mean to alarm you
quick now what news of the king
i i found a directive
from cromwell to my father
he to be lodged for
two weeks at hampton court
and then moved to the tower
well try a rescue then
meantime there work
to be done here
with getting refugees
away to the coast
but when they reach the forest
they must have help food water
and a place to rest if possible
now if you cant do this on your own
you must find somebody
you can trust to help you
take this and study it
it the place of the next rendezvous
twelve men and women will be arriving
at midnight the day after tomorrow
two of them are
personal friends of the king
they are trying to arrange
for his asylum in france
hide quickly
he coming in here
clare
my horse went lame i
this man assisted me
at the stable
thank you for your help
would you give him
a few pennies for me tom
a few pennies
what did he have to do
carry the horse
get out
which leg was it
leg
i thought you said she was lame
the near hind leg
i see
you know horses are no more
to be trusted than women
this one an old faker
id have her shot if i were you
clare
i would change my coat
for you any day
no wait please trust me
who is it
good evening clare
ive come to escort you
to dinner
allow me
im not ready yet
would you wait outside please
no ill wait in here
if you dont mind
get out immediately
youre looking very beautiful
tonight clare
will you leave
no
who are you ringing for
my maid
if you havent gone
by the time she comes
ill get her to fetch my father
do you know something
i love you even more
when youre angry
it does something for your complexion
all i want to do is help you
and im giving you no choice
let put our cards on the table
youre aiding royalists
to escape the country
and youve been doing it
for some time
i also happen to have
a good memory for faces clare
i remember the face of the man
you were talking to in the stable
major john drury
you see we were in the
same company before the war
what do you propose to do
nothing help you
and if i refuse your help
then call your father
you can tell him about me and
ill acquaint him about you
im sure the news will do
something for his complexion as well
it all right mary
i needed some fresh perfume
i found it
is it a bargain
in return for your help
nothing
im merely content
to be around you
watching you like
a guardian angel
what greater love
hath man than this
you know if you werent so
overwhelmed by your own charms
i might grow to like you a little better
you will
i promise
tom i want you to
understand one thing
if were to work together
it for the whole country
it isnt for us
dont change your coat
just for the adventure
youll be serving
the king and his people
do it with your heart
now shall we go to dinner
it looks as if were in for
a hilarious evening doesnt it
judd
the lord protector oliver cromwell
all oliver cromwell
two of the men they questioned
this morning died under torture
indeed
glad i wasnt detailed
three men were branded
another man was tied
allow me to compliment you wyatt
on your delicate choice
of dinner conversation
im captain blake from the
garrison at westerly sir
this afternoon we were attacked
and the station burned to the ground
by whom
there were about 30 men sir against 2
i asked by whom were you attacked
he in the grounds
call out the guards
get after him every one of you
sound the alarm
the scarlet blade
well
he got away sir
ten officers and a hundred men
on duty in the grounds
and you let him get away
someone going to answer for this
i want a full investigation
how did he get into the grounds
how did he slip past the guards
mmm
i think i can tell you
this man who calls himself
the scarlet blade
knows every inch
of this estate why
because he was once a
member of this household
it quite simple logic
you still wonder who he is
i think i can show you
that your scarlet blade
the late master of beverley himself
was cromwell most bitter enemy
he once told me he would fight our
lord protector even from the grave
that precisely what he is doing
well gentlemen
your logic is indeed
admirable colonel but
but what
beverley two sons were
reported killed at preston
im aware of that
they were reported killed
did you see the bodies
no sir
most of you fought at preston
did any of you identify the bodies
by whom were they reported killed
i can tell you
by a prisoner of war
i received the news myself
and recall a certain feeling of elation
which overruled
any doubt in my mind
subsequently that prisoner
whose name was major john drury
escaped
and has been a thorn
in our sides ever since
well sylvester
oh excellent colonel
may i compliment you
on the brilliance of your deduction
we now know who
the scarlet blade is
this is indeed revelation
however sir if i with your permission
might ask one small question
permission granted
how is it going to help us find him
we will resume dinner gentlemen
may the best man win
id like to know what youre thinking
im thinking about the scarlet blade
he seems like a lad
after my own heart
if we can enlist
edward beverley help
well have created a link between
this house and a forest escape route
go on
there a secret passage leads
from the house to the forest edge
how did you discover that
the other night i saw jacob
enter the passage so i followed him
tom why would an old servant
of the beverley family use it
to meet his master
wait youve given me
the germ of an idea
if youre prepared
to risk jacob neck
i think i know how we can
use him to find edward beverley
how
ill tell you if my plan works
ive got to go and see your father
im trusting you tom
youll have to trust me wont you
sylvester and in the forest
this traditional place of execution
known as the gallows tree
and if as i suspect
jacob is an accomplice
of the scarlet blade
then therell be an attempt at rescue
we shall be waiting for him
it quite ingenious
thank you colonel
i had a letter today
from the lord protector
in the first paragraph
he congratulated me
upon securing the arrest of the king
but in the second
he deplored the fact
that the scarlet blade
was still at large
if your little ruse results
in the capture of this man
i shall bring your name
to cromwell notice
thank you
hmm
like a glass of sherry
please
we will dispense with
the formalities of a trial
the old man should be arrested at once
and notice of his execution posted
so that the news reaches
edward beverley in good time
execution to take place
at noon tomorrow
of course i could be wrong
jacob could be quite blameless
in which case we shall have
hanged an innocent man
that would be most distressing
wouldnt it
still i fear that is a hazard
we shall have to risk
yes indeed colonel
but of course we could always
console ourselves with the idea that
jacob died in a very good cause
couldnt we
ive told you listen
it not only your life
im concerned with
it the life of the man you serve
where can i find him
you know whatll happen dont you
hell try to save you
and get cut to pieces
before he gets within
thirty yards of the tree
then theyll hang you anyway
if i wanted to trap edward beverley
id let him walk into the ambush
theyre preparing for him
if i let this happen both he
and all his friends will be caught
dont you understand this jacob
how can i find him
well
i hope i can trust you
how can i find him
youve heard of the dragon tree
yes i know it
there a footpath close by
follow it
it takes you deep into the forest
you will come to an old oast house
there you will find edward beverley
ill need something
to prove im a friend
this ring
master edward himself
gave it to me
take it
why do you want
to help us captain
let us just say
my heart in the royalist cause
your heart
your sword fights for cromwell
how did the two
become disconnected
my royalist cause
happens to be a lady
she helped me to see
the error of my ways
who is the lady
the daughter of colonel judd
judd
and dont condemn her because of her father
at least she didnt turn traitor
it on account of her
that i came to see you here
and because of her
that you can trust me
as for trusting you
i shall reserve my judgement
what is your plan
this is the gallows tree
and here the path leading to it
they are coming
“what about the soldiers
theyre waiting for us
both sides of the gallows tree
right get to work
officer troop dismount
it taking them
a long time getting back
i hope nothing gone wrong
they had the element
of surprise on their side
dont blame me if they didnt
take full advantage of it
here they are now
edward
pablo
this is captain sylvester
captain sylvester
this is my brother philip
im glad to see you alive jacob
thanks to you sir
philip tell the men
to make themselves scarce
and double the sentries
shall we go in
clare this is edward beverley
im afraid our hospitality
is a little rough
i gather some of my father soldiers
have already experienced it
let us get to
the point of the meeting
you may know i have been helping to organise
escape routes for royalist refugees
but there are limits
to what i can do for them
i can direct them to the forest
i can show them the way
to the coast road but
beyond that they have to
fend for themselves
some of them have been taken because
they lack arms to defend themselves
i can supply them with arms
and occasionally an escort
good
now this is a matter
which concerns us even more
the king is being lodged
at hampton court
in two weeks or even less
he may be moved to the tower
thisll be our last opportunity
to rescue him
hell have an escort
of at least a hundred men
a well-prepared ambush
will take care of them
indeed
a party of royalist refugees will be
arriving tonight at twelve oclock
theyll be waiting
at the beverley crossroads
some of them are old men
women and children
can you find ponies for them
constance
well weve got four broken in
thatll have to do
now i know where to find you
goodbye edward
we must be gone
edward beverley is being
supplied with information
by someone inside these walls
how else could he have
countered the trap i set for him
what have you got to say
lieutenant hawke
we didnt stand a chance sir
we were attacked by an ambush
that must have been prepared
long before we arrived
heard the news captain sylvester
yes sir
ten men killed
fourteen wounded
and the rest put to flight
that miserable scoundrel
jacob proust rescued
and edward beverley as
far away from capture as ever
captain sylvester im charging you
with the responsibility
of seeking this man out
and bringing him to justice
those are your instructions
im placing my trust in you
thank you sir
i shall endeavour to take
full advantage of it
all right dismiss
pablo what is your name huh
theresa
theresa
ah that is a beautiful name
my name is pablo
you may call me uncle pablo
you dont have to be frightened anymore
you are going on a little boat
with big sails
to a land where there will be
no trouble for you anymore
some of them have been
travelling a long time
they must get some rest
philip will take them on
to the coast tomorrow
therell be an escort
to lead them through the forest
you go ahead ill follow
you realise that one day
youll be caught
i suppose so
these people are prepared
to sacrifice their homes
and risk their lives
rather than exist under cromwell
one day theyll return
to a free country
im glad to help them
i suppose you think
these are strange words
coming from colonel judd daughter
having met the daughter
i dont think the words are strange
until a few days ago
i had only two thoughts in my mind
to destroy cromwell and put
the king back on the throne
and now
i want to live
l also
i must go
itll all be all right
dont worry
do come in
what kept you
i had work to do
you know that
with edward beverley
tom youve no right to be here
i dont like my privacy
intruded upon
and i dont like you
to question me
im risking my neck for you
i think i have
every right to intrude
and to question
and to make love
we made a bargain
what bargain
you said you would help me
there were to be no conditions
i once told you what i was
im an adventurer like your father
he changed his coat for money
and i for love
you touch that cord
and ill blow your plans to pieces
i dont like the woman i love skulking
in the forest with some vagabond
tom “what
supposing i were to tell you ive
fallen in love with this vagabond
are you insane
no im not insane
im telling you the truth
ive met the man i love
a man youve known but a few hours
and dont protest to me
that love isnt related to time
oh im the one that insane
for setting a trap for myself
you offered to help
yes i offered to help
and now i can sit back
and see the course of history
shaped by people
like you and beverley
full of noble enterprise
but lacking the common guts to put
their own cause before their feelings
i wonder how the king would feel locked
in his rooms at hampton court palace
if he knew about this
and if your devotion
for the king is so great
then you use edward beverley
as you will
but i dont like to be used
i trusted you
and i you
i still trust you
judd captain sylvester
will you come in here please
major bell this is captain sylvester
major bell has been appointed
my deputy by the lord protector
i am leaving for london
immediately to see him
you will of course render major bell
full support during my absence
good night gentlemen
i have here a list
of the various raids
carried out by beverley
since colonel judd
took command here
ten days ago one of the
lord protector emissaries
was attacked and killed
eight days ago four wagons
carrying arms were ambushed
and the escorting soldiers
were killed
on the same day a farmhouse which
served as a barrack for twenty men
was burned to the ground
four days ago
a man called jacob proust
who was to have been hanged
was rescued
i understand you were
in charge of that operation captain
i was in charge
of the detail yes
oh you werent present yourself
i had other duties
to perform at the time
oh yes i see you were engaged in
the purchase of horses at wymington
where i should have thought
you could have relegated that duty
to a junior officer under
the circumstances hmm
however whilst im here
you will personally take charge
of every operation i conceive to
secure the capture of edward beverley
i already have an idea i wish to
discuss with you in this connection
but it can wait till the morning
is that all
that all
captain sylvester sir
ah ask him to come in
good morning captain
have you breakfasted
yes thank you
well be seated
now well deal with
routine matters in due course
but first the outlaw beverley
you realise that this man capture
during colonel judd absence
would reflect very highly
upon all of us
particularly yourself
i have a plan
which may well prove successful
first of all i should like to point out
that search parties are useless
this man too wily a fox to be
caught in his own territory
search parties will
nevertheless continue
now i understand that
beverley has a sister
in future search parties will be
concentrated in the forest area for her
if we succeed in finding this girl
weve virtually found her brother
a life for a life
exactly
well hold her
till he gives himself up
and you will be in charge
of this operation captain
ill see to it
ive just had a message
from major drury
theyre moving the king
in three days time
drury trying to organise an ambush
can you see edward for me
whatll i tell him
tell him ill meet him tonight
at the oast house
i cant make it before then
i think im being watched
ill see what i can do
tom
hmm
you will get through
to him wont you
ill do my best
halt
divide the men into sections
spread them so they take in
an area of six miles
detail two men with me
and reassemble here in eight hours
thatll be after nightfall sir
not frightened of the dark
are you sergeant
jenkins
clare tell edward to make contact
with every available man
tomorrow major drury will return
to give details of the ambush position
the men must be ready to leave
immediately they get the signal
fifty of his men will be
waiting near hampton court
were badly in need of arms
ssh
who is it
man open in the name of cromwell
quickly hide over there
if youre looking for royalists
there are none here
ill decide about that
im a loyal citizen
ill decide about that too
i am the commanding officer
of this garrison
do you wish to save your life
on what terms
tell me where i can
find your brother
never
im giving you the opportunity
of saving your life
if you refuse to talk
ill find him anyway
and youll both die
youll never find him through me
no
but if you give yourself up how do
you know theyre going to release her
you only have their word for it
and what is it worth
someone has betrayed us
who
the only two people
who know where to find us
are captain sylvester and
clare judd
i am thinking of sylvester
and clare
pablo yes
youve lived all your life
by instinct
and that the way you
judge people am i right
you are right
what is your judgement
i can also use my head
and it tells me that this girl
she has done things for your people
i believe that she loves you
and in this my head tells me
what my heart already knows
but this captain sylvester
when i first see him
i want to kill him
because of his uniform
because of him
edward wait
if you go all our plans all our efforts
to save the king go with you
there will be no-one
to carry on our work
except you
i can go in your place
no-one knows which of us
is edward beverley
sylvester knows
how can he say
without betraying himself
i havent as much
to lose as you
edward please let me go
philip i am not going to
give myself up
clare
i was coming to you
you know theyve got constance
yes
where is she
in the cellar
be careful there are guards about
stay here
psst
come on
the courtyard
keep going
colonel judd returns tomorrow
i intend to cheer his homecoming
by the sight of you
hanging by the neck
on beverley green
take him away
whatever you are
roundhead cavalier
adventurer
whatever you like to call yourself
youre still an officer in uniform
and you cant just stand by
and watch this murder
tom i beseech you
go to major bell and ask him
to wait until my father returns
and when your father returns
what do you suppose hell do
at least it would give us some time
there might be some way
of saving edward
if only we had a little time
i think you want him to die
why should i want him to live
so that he free
to take you away from me
tom “what
did you betray us
did you
you still love him dont you
you did betray us
oh how could you be so vile
i once told you that
i didnt like to be used
remember
clare
this shows the place
of the ambush
beverley men should leave tonight
can you get that to him
edward been taken
no
ill try to get it to philip
there there something else
major drury
do you remember captain sylvester
very well
it was he who betrayed edward
he knows about the ambush
has he talked
i dont think so
but he will where is he now
in his quarters round that corner
the first door you come to
very well ill take care of him
guard those plans with your life
and get them to philip
as quickly as you can
drop the knife
i was just about to knock
indeed
sylvester guard
turn out the guard
bell what happened
someone tried to kill
captain sylvester sir
major drury wont be
troubling us again sir
he dead
as mutton
philip therell be twenty cavalry
concealed in these woods
riflemen over here to the left
and this is the main road
from hampton court
it well planned clare
it going to work
itll never work
what do you mean
sylvester will betray us
philip how many men have you got
more than fifty
pablo how about you
my people do not fight for a cause
they love no country
no country loves them
i give philip my blessing
and my help that is all
but youd fight for a life
for edward
that is a different matter
have many of the men left
not yet theyre waiting for me to tell them
tomorrow morning your brother
is due to be hanged
we can save him philip
well if only that were possible
oh it is it is possible
with the help of our men
and pablo we could save him
the whole district will be
turned out to witness the execution
our people and pablo
could mingle with the crowd
there will be only soldiers
the people have been told
to keep to their houses
then we must make a surprise attack
and the king
there no chance for the king
because sylvester will talk
yes
or because youre
in love with my brother
dont you love him
yes of course i do
but he wouldnt thank me if i risked
the life of one single man to save him
but the king stands for the
lives and freedom of all his subjects
then youre going to
throw away the lives of fifty men
because the cause is lost
the king as good as dead
you dont really believe that
if sylvester betrays us
he will have to betray himself
i love my brother very much
but i know that he would do
exactly as i intend to do
if he were in my place
you know im right
ready
who the man about to be executed
edward beverley sir
stop the execution
colonel
im ordering you to stop this execution
your orders were to
apprehend beverley dead or alive
in my view
this man is safer dead
you will refrain from expressing your views
in the presence of junior officers
you will be good enough
to wait upon me at the manor
take the prisoner to the cells
captain sylvester
i want to know the identity
of everyone concerned
with edward beverley
he is to be subjected to
the most extreme forms of persuasion
necessary to loosen his tongue
see to it
sir
release the rope
aye sir
take him away
guard dismiss
tie him up
major bell do you realise that we are
not dealing with one isolated criminal
that this man is the leader of a
dangerous royalist underground movement
i am aware of that sir
then why sir were you not aware
of the necessity to
extract information from him
it was not necessary
no
it might interest you to know that
there is a plot
to rescue charles stuart
its origin stems from this district
beverley is undoubtedly
concerned with it
and he is not working alone
i stated that it was not necessary
to extract information from beverley
because i already know the name
of the principal accomplice
indeed
before you left for london
you told me that someone
had been supplying beverley with
information from inside these walls
i can now tell you
who this person is
and for that reason i saw
no purpose in delaying the execution
i accuse captain sylvester
you have proof
i have proof
request captain sylvester
to see me immediately
if your accusations are correct
sylvester will know of
the king imminent removal
from hampton court to the tower
an attempt to rescue the king
will be made then
go to london immediately and warn
them of the possibility of an ambush
i also advise that the king
should not be removed at present
carry on
captain sylvester
you are under close arrest
you deny nothing
nothing
but i warn you colonel
you bring me to trial
and ill seek clemency
by pleading state evidence
no doubt that will be considered
provided you plead now
i want names
you may be concerned
with only one for the moment
that of clare judd
your daughter
that the name of the woman
that inveigled me into this plot
clare judd
your daughter
what are you saying
she managed to ensnare me
under the pretext of love
she used all her feminine wiles
to trap me
all this will be
part of my defence
maybe none of it
will be taken into account
but at least you colonel
being a staunch
advocate of justice
will have the satisfaction of seeing
justice handed out to everybody
including your own flesh and blood
captain sylvester
no
judd captain sylvester was
shot while resisting arrest
you will observe that his pistol
is still in his hand
get him away
youve been accused of
assisting in the royalist cause
is that true “yes
youve been working
with edward beverley
yes
did you ever stop to think
what would happen to your own father
when your traitorous acts
were disclosed
did you ever have any
feelings for anyone
other than yourself
when you turned traitor
youre the last person
to preach to me
it only you
im concerned with now
fortunately for both of us
there now no danger
of the king rescue taking place
and in a few minutes there will be
no-one left to denounce you
except myself
the king is doomed
nothing i or anyone else can do
can help him now
i am prepared to die
for what i believe is right
if you refuse to release
edward beverley
ill proclaim to the world
what ive done
you would never dare
you dont know me
you will not only condemn yourself
you will condemn me
whatever your feelings are
towards me
i am still your father
give me your pistol
get out
ive tried to make you talk
but now stand up
get on your feet
get a horse
edward
go on go on
they must be almost there by now
were too late
oh please please
were throwing away our only chance
our lives
for nothing
no
clare
forward

back in 29
this place was spanking new
and me and my wife martha
had a little baby girl
so pretty and good
we couldnt believe
and another kid on the way
but when martha had this one
something went wrong
this thing she give me
something happened
he was so big
he came out sideways
and almost tore poor martha apart
he weighed 20 pounds
and was hairy as a monkey
when he was 0 years old
he was big as i was
accidents were happening all the time
dogs falling in the well
i even found chickens
with their heads bit off
then in august of 39
i was in town getting supplies
and the whole damn house
burned to the ground
my little baby girl was a cinder
when i found her
but this monster kid
wasnt even singed
i knew hed done it
i hit him with a tyre iron
and i split his face wide open
how bad was it
i thought id killed him
i was afraid theyd come
and take me away
so i took him out in the desert
and i left him there
i figured if he wasnt dead
he couldnt live more than two hours
out there in that heat
then it would all be over with
and you think his ghost
is still trying to track you
that was a long time ago
long enough for him to steal
a whore that nobody would miss
long enough to raise a passel
of wild kids
long enough for a devil kid
to grow up to be a devil man
what the hell is this
that just some stuff that i
you want some cheese on this
there plenty left
i dont want anything
what the matter

people always say
there no such thing
as the perfect crime
but i dont agree with that
if you plan things
carefully enough
if you think through
every last detail
if you have nerves of steel
if you can remain calm
no matter what happens
there should be no problem
you cant handle
it really all
a matter of character
of course
if i had any character
i wouldnt have stolen
$2 million from my boss
christmas eve
ho ho fucking ho
well how did it go
good went good

what weve done okay
remember that
what weve done
and here the thing
about what weve done

how it could be done
if somebody had the balls to do it
which is me
dont poke vic okay

mr arglist i wonder

hiya pete
merry christmas

good to see you
what are you doing here man
the real people are in there
let go in here
everybody i want you to meet
listen up a friend of mine
this is charlie arglist
the most talented and handsome
mob lawyer in all of kansas
i really wish you wouldnt do that
come on
come on
that was vic cavanaugh you were hanging out with back there
so what
hey let me ask you a question
is it true that one time
he cut the hand off of somebody who stuck their fingers
up the twazzallah of a dancer over at tease-o-rama
look around at the bar
do you see a lot
of one-armed men in here
because if they chopped off
the hand
of every guy who tried
that with a stripper
half the men in wichita
would be wearing hooks
are you trying to tell me that these are just normal guys you work for
what are you doing here
trying to get my ashes hauled
like everybody else
noël joyeux noëll
it all right
he drunk
sarabeth isnt performing
that function anymore
did she do that
for you oftentimes
throughout your saga
occasionally
not very often mmm-hmm
is she still wearing
flannel to bed
silly me
i thought until i met
and married sarabeth
that it was
only little children
who wore those things with the feet sewn on the bottom
you could have warned me
about that
and im actually
being kind of serious here
i tried to pete
i really did
yeah bullshit i was the end
of your alimony problem
that what i was
like hell you were in love
with my wife
love
someday somebody is going
to tally up the cost
of that particular illusion
hey
yeah
did you ever go and
the strippers
yeah occasionally
yeah
yeah sure
when im really desperate
or completely shit-faced
or generally have my head up my ass
im all those three things
right now baby let go
so how you doing
otherwise buddy
great great really great
drawing a lot of buildings
making a fucking fortune
well listen
i gotta make a phone call
if you just hold down
the fort here and remain calm
remain calm
big mob lawyer
sweet cage
sidney is renata back yet
no she just called
said she on her way
all right listen
when she gets back
you tell her i have that present
that i mentioned for her
earlier and not to leave
okay bye
mr arglist
councilman
i wonder if we might
have a quiet word
actually im kind of
would you be good enough to deliver a message from me to mr
guerrard
wichita is a community
of good people mr arglist
christian people
yeah half of them are in this very bar trying to get laid
that may well be
but my point is some time ago
in a moment of weakness
i did a very foolish thing
and that foolish thing
was photographed
i believe that photo is in the possession of a mr
vic cavanaugh
an associate of yours
who refuses to surrender it
despite several generous
offers for its purchase
the last of which
delivered not 0 minutes ago
people can be stubborn
do you think mr
guerrard would be able to persuade mr cavanaugh
oh
to reconsider if he understood his own interests in the matter
well mr
guerrard is one of the most persuasive men i know
what kind of figures
are we talking about here
are we talking about four
five six
five mr arglist
low five
councilman i think
the photo in question
might be closer than you can possibly imagine
youve given me hope mr
arglist merry christmas
wonderful season isnt it
so full of mutual understanding
yeah
you gotta know the whole culture is in the toilet
if a guy dressed like that can get laid in a place like this
hey youre flipping off the mob here
just so you know
did i mention to you that i really wish you wouldnt do that
yeah
m-o-b mob okay
all right let go
right back at you huh
and there that one too
there see
that my chair in there
you wanna know the truth
i cant fill it
neither could i
if it makes you feel any better
listen charlie
before we go in
there something i have to tell you
it been on my conscience
and you can punch me if you want to
i dont think
im gonna want to
back when you and sarabeth were still married that last year
uh-huh
she and i
were fucking
no kidding
like minks everywhere
kitchen table your bed garage
wow
jesus charlie
we were friends
it doesnt make you angry
actually it makes me curious
makes me wonder
who she fucking now
yo ho ho
merry fucking christmas
guess who i brought with me
ghost of christmas past
ooh
marley
get the fuck in here
hey everybody
merry christmas
merry christmas
hello charlie
come in
and have a piece of pie
hi dottie
no thank you im fine
i just wanted to stop in and wish you all a very merry
screw the pie you old harpy
were here for dinner
turkey cranberry
stuffing the works
thanks yeah
yeah motherfucker
yeah
turkey-alurkey
pathetic
what did you say stan
you two are pathetic
makes me ashamed to be a man
im pathetic
im pathetic
who paid for that
hip replacement
your insurance company
wouldnt cover huh
dad tell me that
and who took care of your mortgage
payments when you were recuperating
and when youre
done with that
maybe you could
explain to me who it was
raised his only daughter
to be a cold gossiping
hypocritical bitch
so spence how you doing
go to hell
dont you talk
to your father that way
he not my father
he didnt even send us presents this year
i hate his guts
is that right charlie
you didnt even send them
any christmas presents
no
christmas is tomorrow
guess what daddy
i was in the christmas play
so what
all you were was tiny tim sister
and you didnt even have any lines
and he didnt even
come to watch
he would have
but mommy didnt send an invitation
im sorry charlie
but maybe you should go now
and perhaps you would give
pete a ride home
sarabeth and the children
will be staying here tonight
okay
yeah
listen sweetie
im gonna go
and im gonna come back and visit you tomorrow
all right
dont believe him melissa
he lying all he ever does is lie
shut up
merry christmas charlie
on the whole
i thought that went well
yeah it good
to see the family
what do you say one more drink
the night is young
all right one more
that it okay one more
melissa really misses you
not spencer he hates me
you just gotta give him time
hell come around
your leaving came
at an awkward age for him
a clean break is best
no a clean break is easiest
on you
oh
are you saying
you have no regrets
dont believe in them
bullshit
everybody has regrets
guys our age
what else is there
i ever tell you
my father was a twin
identical
fraternal
looked a lot alike though
him and my uncle
different temperaments
completely
my father he a cop
by-the-book guy
believed in the law
wanted his only son to be a lawyer
drank in moderation
didnt smoke
kept up his
life insurance premiums
voted in every election
not just for president
let me guess
uncle didnt vote
he said he didnt want
to encourage the bastards
in and out of jail
from the time he was 6
drunk all the time
fucked everything that walked
won a fortune playing poker
lost it all the same way
lost an eye in a fight
half his life
so what youre trying to say is
you take after your uncle
i wasnt finished
my father was 54
when he died of a massive embolism
right here in wichita
my uncle
died the very next day
in a car wreck in california
so the point is
it is futile to regret
you do one thing
you do another
i mean so what
what the difference
same result
how many of these lights
you gonna sit through
see if i tell you
another fucking story
sorry guys were closed
we just want one drink
each
my friend a mobster
you might know that you might not
ill tell you what
ill give you one on the house
if you drink it up and leave
but im not opening
my register back up
thank you gorgeous
do you know where this last drink is going to take me
to that perfect stage
of drunkenness
and then do you know
what im going to do
im going to go straight home
go to bed and dream of you
i dont think id pursue that particular line
you with him
yeah
makes no difference
it okay
it a free country
and any man can dream
anything he wants to dream
and tonight
im gonna dream of you
all right i gotta make a phone call
ill be right back

oh fuck
hello
renata
charlie
listen
you were right
vic and i have been skimming
well duh
i think roy gelles
must have found out
and i think
he might have killed vic
that terrible
so i was thinking it might be best if i left town
i was wondering
if you wanted to come with me
you have the money
what
which
the money were talking about
that you and vic
have been skimming
try to keep up okay
no vic had it
so your idea is that we should run away together and be poor
i thought id give it a shot
here the thing though
roy wouldnt have killed vic unless vic told him where the money was
which means roy has it now
well why dont you sneak up
behind him
and hit him over the head
with something and take it
me you want me
to sneak up on roy gelles
charlie think of this
as your defining moment
this is your chance
to be something more
like a murderer
this is your chance
to start over charlie
our chance
if that what you want
if that what i want
listen i just gotta
ask you one thing
what
i didnt have
a specific question planned
nothing sorry

i thought you were dead
i thought roy killed you
well he was going to
but he got sidetracked
you should have been there
he actually threatened
to shoot gladys
if i didnt tell him
where the money was
but i think he was counting
on a level of commitment and affection between her and me
that just simply wasnt there
where is he now

but thatd be great
dont you see
we go out in a blaze of glory
like men
like men charlie
no goddamn life left
for men anymore
not here
this country
all that left for men is money and pussy
but together
you and me together
dont you think
come on hurry up
bill guerrard
is around here somewhere
oh
yeah oh
where is he
oh
hide behind the door and shoot him when he comes in
you dont happen to have
any bullets for this do you
shotgun behind the bar
as wichita falls
so falls wichita falls
i like that
and im gonna give your pussy-whipped pal arglist
another 5 minutes
to rescue your sweet ass
after which time im going to assume his brain overruled his pecker
well bill
that just not enough time
he lives way across town
yeah well that your bad luck
i should be home in kansas city
watching my kids
open their christmas presents
now i gotta waste
the whole fucking day
iooking for that nitwit
ill never understand lawyers
i mean
here theyve got a license to steal from the general public
all legal and aboveboard
but is that enough
fuck no
they gotta steal from their friends
anybody
but a fucking lawyer
would consider
the consequences right
that i would
for an absolute certainty
castrate that son of a bitch
with a butter knife
and that would give
a normal person pause
but not a lawyer
it defies the imagination
you know
how a woman like you could throw in with a couple of farthammers
like cavanaugh and arglist
cavanaugh he doesnt
have the brains
to pull off
something like this
and arglist
he doesnt have the guts
maybe that where you
came in huh
what did you do
did you encourage them both
suppose you do luck out
and you get clear of wichita
with all that money
at some point
youre gonna have to get rid of at least one of the peckerwoods
and then what do you got
a dick with no brain
or a brain with no dick
you know what bill
you seem awfully tense
and i have this idea
of what might help you relax
you do huh
mmm-hmm
that you arglist
drop the gun
step away from the desk
and put your hands up
charlie
dont be a fucking idiot
youve been watching
too many stupid old movies
why would i drop my gun
i dont know bill
because i got
a big fucking shotgun
and ill blow your head off
well if you could do that
youd be me
and id be a pissant lawyer
with a case of the shakes
jesus charlie
just shoot him
if he was gonna
pull the trigger
hed have done it when he came
through the door girlie
it something they dont
teach you in law school
which is a shame
because
get his gun charlie
get his gun
he dead renata
the fuck he is
sidney loads that with birdshot
why would he i mean
charlie
from a liability standpoint
that doesnt make any sense at all
charlie
well arglist
now youve truly gone
and shit in your nest
all right girlie
you first
mr guerrard
what going on
come here
bitch
charlie
i dont know why
i even bother with kansas
do i hear an amen
my old man tried
to tell me
that id be better off
starting a church
and letting jesus pay
for the mortgage
in this sorry-ass
backwards state
i wouldnt listen
instead
i put my faith
in naked women and hand jobs
which have a proven track
record everywhere but here
and now ive been disfigured
by a whisky-dick lawyer
who imagines he can kill me with a shotgun loaded for snake
serves me right
that all i can say
all right girlie
this is the one
that gonna kill you
bill
yuck
i will say after this
the holidays are never gonna feel quite the same to me
how the foot
shorter
you dont happen to have
any morphine
or demerol or anything
do you
try this
i have to give you credit
charlie
you took your own sweet time
rising to the occasion
but in the end
you did the deed
deed you did
you really came through
charlie
the odds were definitely
against it but somehow
you managed to be
the last man standing
i know what i wanted
to ask you
what
where are you actually from
originally
why do you keep
asking questions charlie
what it got to do
with anything
i was just curious
wanted to know
where you came from
it a long story
charlie
i think weve got plenty of time to get to know each other better
dont you
yeah
i guess we do
it just you and me now
charlie
to the victor go the spoils
you saved my life
charlie
youre a different man
just like i promised
can you feel it
yes i can
charlie
whatd you do
oh damn stupid fuck
you stupid fucking whore
you dumb dumb fuck
your mother again
shit
hi charlie yeah
who else
loans me her camper and fails to mention that it out of gas
if youve got a gas can
you can siphon some from me
charlie
i dont want you
to take this the wrong way
but youre about
the nicest guy i know
im awfully sorry to hear that sidney
but thank you
have a good time
with your kids at six flags
merry christmas

morning pete merry christmas
merry christmas buddy

-----NewMovie-----
i know youre
here with someone else
but does he make you happy
does he know
about your interests
i mean does he
really know about them
does he spend weeks raising
a boat from the ocean floor
just for your viewing pleasure
thought it might
make a good photo
does he pay someone
to release a watch of
nightingales
at just the right moment
what wrong
nothing
rusty
release the birds
does he know neurochemically
how to make you happy
you have modulation of
sensory
activation of limbic
system
increased oxytocin
orgasm is achieved
i know how to make you happy
if we were here together
i would do all these
things and we would be happy
am i crazy to think
we would be happy
the infinite man
what
didnt you call ahead
there was no answer
well this would be why
i dont believe it
at this time last year we were
playing musical
instruments over there
fine dining in there
adult activities upstairs
i didnt know they closed down
i am so sorry i am stupid
look it doesnt matter
let go to the beach instead
the beach i had a dream
about the beach last night
great maybe it a sign
no we cant ive drawn up ths
schedule based on last year
you see this was perfect
it was it was also
a year ago and things change
motels shut down
and people move on
i hold in my hands the
blueprint to a perfect weekend
and if we stayif we
follow this very precisely
then
that why were dressed
in the same clothes as last
year
i love you in that dress
i guess it a controllable
variable
i am taking this stuff to the
i am taking these clothes off
i am driving to the beach
and i am going for a swim
lana please i mean surely
a
a deep tissue massage
is preferable to fighting
were not fighting
are we not massaging
no no because i didnt
come all the way out here
just to do exactly what
we did on our last anniversary
no of course not
it nuts
it is youre absolutely
right
im sorry
it okay
you feel tense
yeah it just
please
ill be in the car
do you know where ill be
upstairs with these babies and
some fractionated coconut oil
massaging not masturbating
lana welcome
glad you came back
i think it scrubs up ok
ive bypassed the
main switch board
i found the mattress next door
those sheets arent washed
dont touch those sheets
andthe beach
so
now i had planned
a musical celebration
of your dutch ancestry
forabout now but
you do not have to do that
dont worry i have copies
it a symbolic gesture
the point is we can do
whatever you like
i dont knowsurprise me
my love dutch klompens
should the bass line seize you
eat eat
the menu might be a year old
but the food certainly isnt
except for the dolmades
but they last forever
lana
yea
sexual congress in five
for our last
anniversary i spent months
studying the blue arts
at least in erotica
tantric techniques
the viennese oyster
depressed elephant
i couldnt wait to try it
on someone other than myself
but when the
moment finally arrived i
well i achieved
cosmic consciousness
faster than i would have liked
your cosmic
consciousness was just fine
it could have been
more tantric that all
yes
what this
thisthis is more
stimulating than tantra
well happy anniversary
indeed
something ive been
developing at the lab
it is an external limbic system
so this moment in
time will be encoded in here
and stored
in here
and this is stimulating
intellectually yes
the hope is
that we can retrieve this moment
with complete accuracy
every detail every sensation
we can return to this moment
in time over and over
and over
this is your anniversary
present
wow
i got you a bunsen burner
terry
terry
no
you really need to tell him
it over youve broken up
what are you doing here
terry
i thought you should know
that you left some
washing on your line
you drove
three hours to tell me that
i submit these
somebody could
have stolen them
hey
did she tell you that i threw
javelin at the olympics
yea i upset the establishment
with my politics
and my drug taking
when they came to
take my medals from me
i threw them like a
javelinoff the balcony
the officials got the medals
this has to stop terry
we broke up four years ago
yeah well now i am back
this is unbelievable
every time every time he ruins
it
it a long drive maybe he jt
needs to stretch his legs
then hell leave
what is he getting from the
car
his javelin
this is too much
and a pack of condoms
and some kind of cattle prod
what kind of stretch is this
hey lana

bifurcated dildo
or should i grab one from the
car
that was for him not for
okay that it
terry terry no

holiday
this is our chance
let justtake these helmets
hop in the car
well leave him here

after you left i stayed out
here
i needed some time alone
twelve months in our
old room thinking about stuff
trying to keep busy
i dont believe i am a jealous
manbut i have been thinking
about you and him
and yourposition
i know i drove you away
but ive been building
something
i had some things
setup from the lab
and ive been working on
something that i think
might take us back
to how things were
i think we should give
it one more go please
things will be different this
time
look no need to say anything
just give me a sign
identifying instability
in a closed loop circuit
short the voltage source
open the loop in the fourth
pass
then apply a test signal
and observe the gain
and phase around the loop
make sure the voltage source
dean
dean
hello
hi

you look different
different
more stable
i am im very stable
i want us to try things again

the perfect day and
you threatened to set me on f
yes but prior to that
then you called me a whore
sounds better in french
and all dutch folk
dancing in the world

you controlling everything

and what is on there exactly
the past a point in time
our anniversary weekend

it
i do not want to re-live it
i want to change it

lana
yea
sexual congress in five
you said it really tough time

like a threesome like that
well maybe if it
not to paradoxical
we could have sex
me and you
that part of theschedule
all my tantra books

the vessel for honorable use
it what he calls it
you once said he was more
athletic in bed

it
just different influences
terry approach to sex is
veryold testament

we would be happier
somewhere else

it only one year and
and summer always flies
by so it likenine months
nine to twelve months
twelve months
then we can leave
and what did we do exactly
for the nexttwelve months
do you remember
our first actual date
i do
i was nervous as hell
you were relaxed talkative
then i found your notes
famous quotes current affairs
topics of conversation
art music science
do you remember
everything about that night
everything
in fact i recorded it on tape
i wanted to review it
after the date
and make sure
that i sounded natural
obviously it relies on the
presumption of male
hetrosexual spectatorship
does that make
it a bad painting no
andof course
of course
dean are you okay
and of course there george
brock
later i edited the tape
i spliced in a few gags
thing i didnt think of at
the time
getting brock the
basics you might say
that not my laugh
no it the closest i could
find
you know what this is
what
justone big revision
it an improvement it
not
is this an improvement
i would say so yes
because sometimes it
feelsa little unorthodox
no
this is the modern world
it a modern relationship
what are you doing
going to the bathroom
to see if i can lure
a dean into a cubical
see i would say
that a little unorthodox
unorthodox
i am a man
responding to his environment
have you got lipstick
i dont want to say
that youre living in the past
well obviously
i am living in the past
but i mean
you say you fell disconnected
shhh
maybe that why
you feel disconnected
maybe if you just stop
listening and watching
what about you
well what about me
i see the way you look at him
it the same way i look at
you
exactly
so i do not want
me to look at you
no him
who
dean
are you jealous
should i be
i do not even know
how to answer that
i used to watch us up here
i used to think we were happy
we are happy
we could be happier
why do you
hate yourself so much
are you kidding look at him
sorry just forget about it
tomorrow everything
returns to normal
everyone travels back
and were alone together
we can
go where ever we want
this is the plan
we do not touch a thing
everyone travels back
just like they always have
and then we are alone okay
okay
good okay
happy anniversary
dont worry i am here to help
okay i was in the
bedroom testing the amp
dean
you called out
i came down
the other lana where is she
she should be here by now
i do not know
well this is
how it began remember
with her down there
well maybe
if lana doesnt show
then dean wont travel back
and if dean doesnt
travel back then
things will get very
complicated
you have to go down there
what
yea until the other lana
arrives you have to go down
there
and say all the things she said
it has to be exactly the same
it nuts it wont work
it will work it has to
it the only way
but what if he
takes me back with him
that impossible
it cant happen
youll switch with the
other lana before then
theyll travel back
and once they do
it just you and me it
simple
how will i even
know what to say
tape this to your chest
put this in your ear
and ill tell you
exactly what to say
you tell me what to say no
no
not tell remind your words
i am just reminding you
testing testing
it is the only way
to ensure they travel back
and how do i know which one
is him and which one is you
just listen to your heart
also listen to the
ear piece and will tell you
okay stop there
now call out his name twice
dean

identify the instability
and if i find you there
ill save you from it
butim right here
you are but that doesnt
mean you are not there too
lord knows i am
wait
identifying instability
in a closed loop circuit
short the voltage source
open the loop in the forth pass
then apply the test signal
and observe the gain
and phase around the loop
short the voltage source
and open the loop
dean

then you called me a whore
sounds a lot better in
french
and all dutch
folk dancing in the world

lana
-----NewMovie-----
voice  i know youre
here with someone else
but does he make you happy
does he know
about your interests
i mean does he
really know about them
does he spend weeks raising
a boat from the ocean floor
just for your viewing pleasure
thought it might
make a good photo
does he pay someone
to release a watch of
nightingales
at just the right moment
what wrong
nothing
rusty
release the birds
does he know neurochemically
how to make you happy
you have modulation of
sensory
activation of limbic
system
increased oxytocin
moaning
orgasm is achieved
moaning
i know how to make you happy
if we were here together
i would do all these
things and we would be happy
am i crazy to think
we would be happy
the infinite man
watch beeping
what
didnt you call ahead
there was no answer
well this would be why
i dont believe it
at this time last year we were
playing musical
instruments over there
fine dining in there
adult activities upstairs
i didnt know they closed down
i am so sorry i am stupid
look it doesnt matter
let go to the beach instead
the beach i had a dream
about the beach last night
great maybe it a sign
no we cant ive drawn up ths
schedule based on last year
you see this was perfect
it was it was also
a year ago and things change
motels shut down
and people move on
i hold in my hands the
blueprint to a perfect weekend
and if we stayif we
follow this very precisely
then
that why were dressed
in the same clothes as last
year
i love you in that dress
i guess it a controllable
variable
i am taking this stuff to the
i am taking these clothes off
i am driving to the beach
and i am going for a swim
lana please i mean surely
a
a deep tissue massage
is preferable to fighting
oh were not fighting
are we not massaging
no no because i didnt
come all the way out here
just to do exactly what
we did on our last anniversary
no of course not
it nuts
it is youre absolutely
right
im sorry
it okay
you feel tense
yeah it just
please
ill be in the car
do you know where ill be
upstairs with these babies and
some fractionated coconut oil
massaging not masturbating
lana welcome
glad you came back
i think it scrubs up ok
ive bypassed the
main switch board
i found the mattress next door
those sheets arent washed
dont touch those sheets
andthe beach
so
now i had planned
a musical celebration
of your dutch ancestry
forabout now but
tears paper
you do not have to do that
dont worry i have copies
it a symbolic gesture
the point is we can do
whatever you like
i dont knowsurprise me
playing accordion
my love dutch klompens
should the bass line seize you
bottle popping
eat eat
the menu might be a year old
but the food certainly isnt
laughter
except for the dolmades
but they last forever
sprays mouth
lana
yea
sexual congress in five
for our last
anniversary i spent months
studying the blue arts
at least in erotica
tantric techniques
the viennese oyster
oh depressed elephant
i couldnt wait to try it
on someone other than myself
but when the
moment finally arrived i
well i achieved
cosmic consciousness
faster than i would have liked
your cosmic
consciousness was just fine
it could have been
more tantric that all
yes
what this
thisthis is more
stimulating than tantra
well happy anniversary
indeed
something ive been
developing at the lab
it is an external limbic system
so this moment in
time will be encoded in here
and stored
in here
and this is stimulating
intellectually yes
the hope is
that we can retrieve this moment
with complete accuracy
every detail every sensation
we can return to this moment
in time over and over
and over
this is your anniversary
present
wow
i got you a bunsen burner
car pulling up
horn honking
terry
terry

washing on your line

it one more go please
things will be different this
time
look no need to say anything
just give me a sign
dial tone
identifying instability
in a closed loop circuit
short the voltage source
open the loop in the fourth
pass

and observe the gain
and phase around the loop

it only one year and
and summer always flies
by so it likenine months
nine to twelve months
twelve months
then we can leave
and what did we do exactly
for the nexttwelve months
do you remember
our first actual date
i do
i was nervous as hell
you were relaxed talkative
then i found your notes
famous quotes current affairs
topics of conversation
art music science
do you remember
everything about that night
everything
in fact i recorded it on tape
i wanted to review it
after the date
and make sure
that i sounded natural
obviously it relies on the
presumption of male
hetrosexual spectatorship
does that make
it a bad painting no
andof course
of course
dean are you okay
fast forwards tape
and of course there george
brock
later i edited the tape
i spliced in a few gags
thing i didnt think of at
the time
getting brock the
basics you might say
laughter
that not my laugh
no it the closest i could
find
you know what this is
what
justone big revision
it an improvement it
not
is this an improvement
i would say so yes
because sometimes it
feelsa little unorthodox
no
this is the modern world
it a modern relationship
what are you doing
going to the bathroom
to see if i can lure
a dean into a cubical
see i would say
that a little unorthodox
unorthodox
i am a man
responding to his environment
have you got lipstick
i dont want to say
that youre living in the past
well obviously
i am living in the past
but i mean
you say you fell disconnected
shhh
maybe that why
you feel disconnected
maybe if you just stop
listening and watching
what about you
well what about me
i see the way you look at him
it the same way i look at
you
exactly
so i do not want
me to look at you
no him
who
dean
are you jealous
should i be
i do not even know
how to answer that
i used to watch us up here
i used to think we were happy
we are happy
we could be happier
why do you
hate yourself so much
are you kidding look at him
sorry just forget about it
tomorrow everything
returns to normal
everyone travels back
and were alone together
we can
go where ever we want
this is the plan
we do not touch a thing
everyone travels back
just like they always have
and then we are alone okay
okay
good okay
happy anniversary
dont worry i am here to help
okay i was in the
bedroom testing the amp
dean
you called out
i came down
the other lana where is she
she should be here by now
i do not know
well this is
how it began remember
with her down there
well maybe
if lana doesnt show
then dean wont travel back
and if dean doesnt
travel back then
things will get very
complicated
you have to go down there
what
yea until the other lana
arrives you have to go down
there
and say all the things she said
it has to be exactly the same
it nuts it wont work
it will work it has to
it the only way
but what if he
takes me back with him
that impossible
it cant happen
youll switch with the
other lana before then
theyll travel back
and once they do

well written
they seem very accurate
i appreciate the call
and i am kind of busy right now
i have a special interest in your stories
why is that
because it was me
i killed her
who is this
you dont expect me to answer that
do you
it depends on why you called
i get 30 calls every day
people claiming responsibility for anything
what makes you so different
i called because i want to help you
how could you help me
her right rear pocket
was there something in it
i hope youre as bright
as i assumed you were
listen
can you be at your phone
at 300
hello
hey ray
so you guys
decided to hold out on me
what do you want mal
weve got a court appearance make it fast
did you look through her clothes
what did you find
none of your fucking business
i thought youd find something
in her right rear pocket
we did lint
take it easy
wait a second
malcolm hold on
how do you know
he called me
who called you
the killer
shit come here
he says the killer called him
bullshit
what did he say what did he sound like
he said he left something in her pocket
he didnt sound like anything
couldve been the red cross
was he white black oriental
white probably over 30
did he say
he was gonna call again
what did you find
no
take it easy
hold on
weve gotta tell him what weve got
no
what do you mean no
hell just stir it up
he got no reason to lie to us
well be okay
this is not for publication
you know me better than that
i just want to know
what were talking about
it was a note
what did it say
raymond
number one
dont go crazy on this
if this is the same guy
youre gonna want to talk to me
now wait a second
what do you got for us
i havent got anything
what do you mean
give me a call when you get outta here
just dont jump to any conclusions mal
come on guys
doesnt anybody have anything better to do
anderson
afraid i wouldnt call
i wasnt certain
certainty i have learned
is something the world
is in very short supply of
did you call and talk to the police
yes
what did they say
there was something in her pocket
suppose you tell me what it was
a true skeptic
notepaper folded once
two words
number one
there going to be a number two
and a three a four and a five
why
it too early for that
youre doing this
on some kind of schedule
something along those lines
and you already know who they are
i know what they are
three women and two men
i just might not print this
then youll miss a wonderful opportunity
ill call someone else
look youre going to be
my conduit to the public
tell me about it
look that all for now
well talk again
after number two
this is the one youve been waiting for mal
fabulous
im not sure this story
will do us or anybody else any good
unfortunately there no way
of seeing where this thing could go
it could take some kind of twist
and we could look negligent
the chance of liability
he didnt call the paper he called me
we have a chance here
let alone the obligation
to do a piece on a sociopath
who still out there he still a threat
that our responsibility
isnt it
this story is gonna sell
a hell of a lot of newspapers for somebody
legally how far
could our asses be hanging out
did you tell him youd protect his identity
no
did you imply that it was off the record
no
make them comfortable
we have three impatient cops outside
lovely
can we go talk to them
i think wed better
thank you
how many times has he called
twice
we want a statement from anderson
and to look at his notes
you know better than that
no notes
weve got a guy who gonna kill someone
wed like your cooperation
but if we have to
well get a subpoena
what happened to freedom of the press
youre abusing the privilege
that your opinion
that a fact
if we dont write about these guys
you never get them
well take care of our end
you know we cant be required
to turn over the notes
no ill tell you what i know
if this son of a bitch kills somebody else
ill tell the post
that you held back information
that couldve prevented it
we didnt say
we werent going to cooperate
we want an arrangement
we can all live with
how about a tap on anderson phone
you wont need it
well give you the tapes
okay
so what the deal here
you give us whatever you get 24 hours
before the other newspapers and tv stations
no weve got relationships to maintain
six hours
sold
i just might not print this
then you will be missing a wonderful
opportunity ill call someone else
look youre going to be
my conduit to the public
there must be some kind of profile here doc
we need something to narrow this guy down
im not a mind-reader
im a shrink
i cant tell anything from one short
taped conversation
but isnt there something anderson could do
to keep him talking longer draw him out
i think youre doing
the right things intuitively
listen to him
when he unclear ask questions
i wouldnt be judgmental and i wouldnt
push him into giving more than he wants to give
be patient
be a friend
what are you guys doing here
give us a break
the man you talked to the killer
did he say when hed call next
he didnt say anything
that would narrow it down guys
how long did you talk to him
0 minutes how long was it
how long was the conversation
neither one was more than a few minutes
come on guys
everything i know is in the paper
are you gonna be able
to live with yourself
did he say
when hed call next
malcolm anderson a journalist
with the miami journal
is the only one to have
been contacted by the killer of sarah hooks
the young girl found murdered
on bill baggs beach
anderson has been contacted twice
and each of the two conversations were brief
lasting only a minute or two
it is known for sure that he has established
a definite contact with anderson
for reasons that no one
has been able to determine
malcolm anderson seemed reticent
to talk to reporters
apparently confused by
all the media attention
according to
mr anderson story
neither he nor the public
has heard the last of this individual
although news center 7 went to
great lengths to get him to elaborate
id like to see what you guys would have said
he refused to say more
im jill beach news center 7
im sorry honey were you awake
we stopped by for a beer
im sorry honey
i saw you on the television
did you
what did you think
i looked like a jerk didnt i
i just looked like such a frump
let talk about obnoxious
did you believe those guys
i mean these are my friends
when youre on 60 minutes
do you mind giving me a call
id like to bring the machine home and tape it
you think i ought to do that show
why not

anderson
how can i love a small-town newspaper man
what christine honey
i cant keep this line tied up
who christine
your wife or your girlfriend
i tested your faith
didnt i
you were beginning to worry
that i wasnt going to call you again
was that the idea
it would be nice
if you wanted to talk to me
but still your words are the important thing
and i do like them
thank you
ever tried to describe a smell
why
youre gonna smell something
that gonna test your writing abilities
it has a sweetness to it
and at the same time it reaches into
your body and twists your insides
but the odd thing is
that once you smell it
you know what it is without having to look
65 nautilus got that
if youre gonna get sick
get sick out here got it
id be careful with this guy
he knows as much about you as you do him
malcolm
one at a time
one at a time
did you talk to the killer
yes
what did he say
ive got a deadline just like you do
everything i know
will be in tomorrow journal

youre out of your mind
without you im nowhere
back to square one
besides we work well together
i dont want to lose that
what did you call about
i have two needs malcolm
the need to talk
and the other one
and
it a lot easier to find a victim
than it is a listener
what about friends
i had one friend
until the plant closed
what plant was that
an auto plant in detroit
a machine took his hand
it took three fingers clean off
that really awful
you and he keep in touch
oh malcolm
youre so transparent
im just doing my job
youre the story
youre trying to make a connection
to someone who can lead the cops to me
were friends
but were not really friends
i want to talk about
the old people now
all right
whyd you pick them
they were a match
a reasonable duplication
was it something youve heard or read about
it was just like before
i caught them on their porch
i just stared
and you know
they couldnt move
then when the gun came out
they couldnt even speak
fascinating isnt it malcolm
i got them into the dining room
i put a pillow
in front of the gun
even so it was much louder
than i expected
i dont know how long i was in there
five minutes an hour
when i left
i was covered with blood
i walked right down the street
i was invisible
nobody seemed to notice me
nobody cared
hello
christ i got a lot
appreciate it ed

were about to talk to malcolm anderson
a reporter for the miami journal
recently the series of brutal murders
in his city has changed his objectivity
because the killer chose to use him
as a liaison
between the community
the police and himself
a situation has developed where a reporter is
materially involved in the story he covering
he with us at wsvn
our nbc affiliate in miami
good morning thanks for being with us
my pleasure john
tell us when and where
you received that first call
it was at the journal
a few days after they found the first body
how did you react
when he told you who he was
of course
i didnt believe him at first
in my years of reporting
ive had my share ofpeculiar calls
but he convinced you
he did have knowledge of the murder
and the victim no one else couldve had
how many times have you and he talked
five times john
can we assume that he hasnt said anything
that been of much help to the police
it wouldnt be helpful for me to comment
on the progress of the investigation
after talking to him
as often as you have
what your sense
of the relationship that developed
relationship suggests that
there something in it for both parties
im certainly doing what i can to help
but this wasnt my idea he called me
has he ever said why he called you
yes he said he liked the way i write
i saw you on tv this morning
i didnt like it
why
youre becoming more important than me
im doing the work
you get put on tv
youre getting
too much attention
i really wish i could come forward
and speak for myself
of course i cant
ive only been arrested once
what year
come on
im already being too generous
on phones that are tapped
my phone isnt tapped
is there any chance
well ever meet in person
so you can bring the cops
and be a real hero
you anger me you know that
cuban coffee phil
i really wish
i could come forward
this is interesting
of course i cant
ive only been arrested once
what year
come on
im already being too generous
on phones that are tapped
my phone isnt tapped
is there any chance well ever meet in person
dumb
so you can bring the cops
and be a real hero
him you arrest dead
youve gotta catch him first
you get a feel for him
you figure out what hell go after next
and then you blow his diseased brains out
im gonna get
some american coffee
we sent a guy to michigan
there no record of the industrial accident
that he described
not at any
of the major assembly plants
ive got a 50
says he making all this up
youre not tapping my phone
right ray
no
good night ray
yeah
perfect wide open
por favor
i deliver for you the paper
what happened
ive been with the cops all night
and the place is wide open
is it too much trouble
to lock the goddamn door
i didnt even know
you were gone
im sorry
i dont want to be around this any more
im sorry i mean it im sorry
dont be
dont be
youre living alone and im living
with somebody i dont even know
it doesnt work
what does that mean
im putting a lot of time in the story
and you feel left alone
that all there is to it
right
you have no idea what it is
you cant
youre not paying enough attention
chris ive busted my ass for eight years
what weve wanted is right here
dont you understand that
ever since they started the body count
youve let everything slide
ive gotten so far away
that leaving just a formality
this is the last thing we need right now
i said i was sorry okay
i heard you
you want a drag
drag your ass
you gotta be closer
than youre saying
id like everyone to think so
you got a voiceprint his mo
and you know he duplicating
you know the part of the country he from
youve gotta be getting somewhere
this guy is killing people he had no
personal contact with nobody he mad at
it tough
what do you do all day
we run down 25 or 30 phone calls from people
who think they live in the same room with him
so do i
when you write enough about somebody
he starts sounding like everybody
i didnt expect it to last this long
as long as he out there
he definitely news
yes so are you
what are you saying to me
i never understand what the fuck youre saying
what the hell the matter with you
im tired of him
youre getting in places you dont belong
damnit
hey walk away
go get him wilson
catch him so we can all go home
youre coming apart on me mal
if you come apart you crash
right now we got nothing
get this guy before he kills somebody else
im tired of being your contact man
son of a bitch
if youd like a nice home-cooked meal
and some quiet conversation
i hope to see you soon
after the last killing i read that
the killer worked on an auto assembly line
i remember a guy from
kenosha wisconsin or somewhere
who was connected
to something like this
you wrote the killer was duplicating
other murders
he sounds like the one
i heard about
there some kind
of a list there
ill talk to you alone
no police either
i live at the paradise trailer park
if anybody or any cops come with you
ill deny i wrote this
here the address
what do you think
give it a shot
why not
excuse me
you mr anderson
yeah
all alone
i think im glad youve come
ive gotta get this thing refitted
down at the va hospital
they treat you pretty good
down there
im just gonna take a couple of notes
you dont mind do you
i guess go ahead
but i dont want my name in the paper
this guy wont think twice
about wasting me
ive been wasted enough already
gotta hang on to what i got left
i can give you anonymity
but the police are gonna want to talk to you
let me think about that
im a little short on time
im working on a deadline
so why dont we start with your name
listen ive been led to believe that
you people pay for this kind of information
i dont
oh come on it wont be much 20 0
do you have any information for me
or not
this guy name was ohaughnessy
i met him downtown
down at the salvation army
kind of a juicer
he was depressed all the time
but then he had good reason to be
about a year ago
he lost his parents
his wife sister-in-law
and teenage daughter
what happened
his brother
went out of his head
got his gun in the middle of the day
and killed them all
put the muzzle right here at the base
of their skulls and blew their heads off
sound familiar to you
you said his last name was ohaughnessy
do you remember his first name
albert i do believe
where was this
kenosha wisconsin
he worked on a pacer line
he used to call them kenosha cadillacs
this guy from detroit
kenosha
i got that right here
in my notes
excuse me a minute
here it is
i gotta take myself a piss
this is really good
it really all i need
i gotta get your name
for legal reasons
mike hilson spec 4
honorably discharged april  97
is that h-i-l-s-o-n
that right
killed me some slopes with this
it no good at a distance
but when you drop them with the m-6
thisll stop them wriggling
click it if you want
firing pin out because
my nephew likes to play with it
you dont need to tell me
it a lousy toy for a kid

anderson
hi it me
what the hell
are you trying to prove
you were getting bigger than me
i had to bring you down a peg or two
you did that
call somebody else your story gotten old
im going to freshen it up
i had planned on
talking to someone else
fine im not writing
one more word about you
i knew this would happen
but youre still going to have a part
no no part
dont be that way malcolm
remember
no one safe no one immune
are you threatening me
i study people too
just like a reporter
watch their habits
their routines
supposing her car
wouldnt start
how would she know the wires
had been switched on the distributor cap
do you think shed turn down help
from a substitute teacher
hey
what the matter with you
would you like me to take a look
oh sure please
i dont know what wrong
it was fine this morning
this isnt my field
but sometimes i get lucky
shit
okay try it again
set up perimeter here
come with me
where christine connelly
i dont know
i saw her in the hall talking to someone
just a few minutes ago
who
hey man what are you trying to do
you want to get somebody killed
what wrong
can anybody walk around
your goddamn school
enough
did you see them leave maam
stay here
come on out
it okay now
were just looking for the bad guys
crayons huh so that it
sorry kid
mal
this guy is all flash
she okay
you think so ray
yes
if he duplicating those five killings
he already accounted for all the women
she okay
have you ever noticed that the older you get
the smaller you become
when i was a little kid
the block we lived on
was the whole world to me
i knew everybody
i was significant even important
are you gonna kill me
let try to keep these things
as abstract as possible okay
apple
i want you to understand something
what
youre killing people
because you want to be noticed
you want to feel significant
hey as a teacher
your range of comprehension
could be improved
im sorry
for the most part
good behavior goes unnoticed
what do you care
i do care
just tell me what you want understood
just tell me what you want
it not important
nothing is
all youre concerned
about is dying
im not responsible
it not my fault none of it is
just give it a couple
of full rings
it nolan
okay
some guy who been following my stories
just walked into the journal
he thinks he knows the killer
he says he knows him well
tell him were on our way
what if the call comes here
he knows where to reach you mal
ten minutes
look maybe this isnt
the right person
it seemed weird to me
when i read my name in that story
you got from the guy at the trailer
those five murders he told you about sound like
a series of murders in chicago a few years ago
i was working at a state-funded
halfway house at the time
for dopers alcoholics
mental hospital discharges
some character stumbles into my office and
says he the guy who killed those five people
he says he went to the cops
and turned himself in
but they chased him out when some
psychiatrist decided that he was somebody
who got off
making confessions
he needed the headlines
is that what you thought
i went down to the precinct with him
and listened to his story
it sounded straight to me
it turned out though that he did have
a history of false confessions
he was pissed though
i mean he was pissed
he figured he finally did something
and somebody else got the credit
after the visit to the police
he kept coming around
he calls one more time
after things quiet down
he wants to thank me
for being so unselfish
he said if i tried to get
any attention from what hed done
hed have me killed
you got a name on this guy
yeah
alan delour
sounds like our man
lieutenant no one up here

maggie
maggie maggie
maggie
hey
-jonathon  -are you still afraid
i am afraid im afraid of all of them
theyre hard and theyre cruel and one day well be found out and-
well well just wait for that day
i love you maggie
i am going to take you away
there must be some place outside this island where we can find happiness
maggie gasps
do you believe me now standing
your son
and my wife
i would never have believed it but for the evidence of my own eyes
-i can explain let me talk to you -you have sinned in the eyes of god
-you will not go unpunished -by god
i am the representative of god here
my punishment is his
amen
arrest them
get after her
come back girl
piranha
maggie no maggie come back
maggie come back
maggie yelping
no
maggie groans
a judgment
thy will be done
thou shalt not commit adultery
that is the lord commandment
this unhappy woman took no heed of it
and she was punished by god
but this man was not punished
so it becomes our duty to judge him here
do you deny the charge laid against you
yes and i claim the right to defend the virtue of a woman
who cannot answer for herself
spectators aye
godfrey mason i deny you the right to sit upon that bench
i am an elect-man of this community
jonathon you are also my accuser
what kind of law permits the plaintiff to sit in judgment at the accused
spectators aye
jehovah an eye for an eye
grunting
-trial over yet -no not yet henry
-theyve been in there long -what about you
it devil work and tom and i dont care to witness it
with that lot on the bench i pity poor jonathon
-god save him -and all of us
he not on trial because he immoral
no it because he stands for everything that theyre against
the elders are afraid of him
theyll see this opportunity of using the father to condemn his own son
then theyll have it all their own way
chattering
were waiting for the verdict henry
im afraid it a foregone conclusion
your father will have no choice
it hard for me to believe that a father could be so harsh
as to convict his own flesh and blood
jason standing is a sick man bess
but he not beyond all human feeling
gavel pounding
were waiting for you jason
jonathon standing
you are charged with having broken one of the most sacred laws of god
through that sin you have caused the death
of the unhappy woman who was your partner in it
you have been found guilty
and as god deputy here in this community
it is my duty to pronounce the sentence of this court upon you
before i do have you anything to say
yes
i am not guilty
the cause of maggie death was fear
fear of her brutal husband
yes fear is your weapon it a dangerous weapon
one day it will recoil on your own heads
spectators aye
weve heard enough
proceed
the ten commandments
are the prime laws by which our settlement is governed
and the penalty for breaking any major one of them can
as you know be death
but because our god is merciful so we will be merciful
spectators aye
therefore we have decided that you shall be taken from here
and tomorrow transported to the penal colony
where you will remain for 5 years
-spectators no -no
no
woman no mercy no
murmuring
take charge of your prisoner
-shame -shame
have courage
spectators exclaiming
do you know what youve done father
youve sent him to die no one can live in that place
youve sent jonathon to die your own son
cant you see that these men are using you
dont bess it no good youre only hurting yourself
your grandfather would be very proud of you jason standing
now bess no crying i dont wanna remember you like that
im sorry this had to happen jonathon
you did warn me
it was different this time i loved maggie
you wouldnt understand that
im in love too jonathon
yes i know
take care of her henry
try to see that my father comes to no harm
whatever he done whatever he become it isnt for himself
ill do what i can when the time comes
there got to be some change in this persecuted tyranny-ridden place
it will come
perhaps not your way jonathon but it will come
man giddap there
whip cracking
get on
mr jonathon standing
we are honored with such illustrious company mr standing
and what a fine figure we have
no wonder the ladies like you
well see to it you dont get too fat
well start you off nice and gently
dont forget to thank your lucky stars before you eat it
thank yours
get out of here
keep back keep back
bird squawking
come on get moving
yells
get up there after them
after them
look out
run run
dogs whimpering
whimpering continues
dogs barking
barking continues
barking continues
-straight for the swamp -yeah
dogs barking
birds squawking chirping
gasps
-here help me -i got you
-well that one less for us to bury -yeah
get up
get up
get up
well hello matey what do we got here
-what vessel are you from huh -im not off a ship
-maybe an eagle dropped you eh -who fired that shot at you
-come on -who put these on you
-who put them on you eh -answer my questions
-come on -the settlement
inland
i was a prisoner i escaped
oh well youd better come and see our captain
aye he an expert on punishment
thank you mr hench
my name is laroche
i understand that you live on this island
that you have been in a penal settlement
where you have been undergoing punishments
where is the main settlement
about 50 miles
inland to the north
we were not aware the island was inhabited
when was this settlement founded
oh a hundred years ago
by whom
my great-grandfather
-a refugee -yes
-a huguenot -yes
the king must be displeased to have that wealth slip through his fingers
i said nothing about wealth
no of course you didnt no
sounds like quite a paradise this island doesnt it
just the sort of place weve always dreamed of captain
must have been a wrench for you leaving the settlement
well im going back
youre going back
-for revenge -no
to help my friends
as they would help you it seems
“do unto others as you would be done by” our motto really
our motto without a doubt
well go with you
with me what for there nothing there for you
on the contrary i think there is a great deal for both of us
im prepared to help you well shall we say
get rid of some of the undesirable elements in your settlement
im talking to a pirate what could be your purpose in wanting to help me
you underestimate us mr standing
pirates sometimes have other interests besides money
i will admit that there is another reason
for my wanting to establish friendly relations with your people
you have apparently existed on this island for many years
undetected
now for me in my profession
there a great advantage in having somewhere that is safe and secure
where we can rest between voyages and replenish our stores
ours is a very hard life mr standing
and you can well understand how very often we long
for a quiet haven of rest like this
for this
you would help me to bring a just rule to the settlement
you have my word
you need me i need you
strike off this gentleman chains
get him some food and some fresh clothes
we leave at daybreak
come on matey well look after you
oh you havent half got something to answer for matey
sputters
-mr hench -yes captain
i intend to reach the settlement by tomorrow nightfall
tell the men they must make better time
captain the men havent rested in six hours
this isnt a sunday afternoon picnic mr hench
get a move on there you lubbers
the captain wants you to make more speed
you can tell the captain to go-
tell the captain what brocaire
spits
all right you men let move huh
alle alle
it all right for the captain he doesnt need sleep
you gotta have sleep
the captain doesnt need food nor water nor sleep nor nothing
when he hears you moaning he wont need you
i dont need you to tell me
shouting
shouting continues
diamonds rubies sapphires
youre dreaming man
this time it may come true
what are you gonna do with your share mr hench
i do not count my chickens before i see them
and then i wait until the eggs are hatched out
if the captain is right about this egg i will have my own ship
-brocaire -for me no more sea
just an island somewhere like this
very peaceful
full of beautiful golden women and no men
man peaceful oh matey
youve got a mighty quaint idea of what peaceful
mr standing have you ever wondered what youd do if you found a fortune
ive never been near one i havent had occasion to think about it
-you sure about that -yes quite sure
that not what the captain thinks
you seem to set a lot of store by what the captain thinks
im very close to the captain mr standing
i understand his mind i can read him like a book
he a great man the captain
as strong as a lion as cunning as a mongoose
and as vicious as a snake
a very great man indeed mr standing
and he knows every trick of the trade
he not like other men he dont even sweat
what he thinking mack
youre so close to him you must know what he thinking
i was daydreaming mr standing
you were talking about a fortune
you shouldnt never take no notice of what a man says in his sleep
happy dreams mr standing
-captain laroche -yes
we struck a bargain before we started out here
that quite correct the bargain still stands
i hope you dont share the same illusion as one of your men
and what is that
apart from the natural advantages the settlement has to offer you
there nothing else
there no fortune no money and no treasure
i believe you have made this point before
the more you stress it the more convinced i am
you see my men are always dreaming about treasure
i encourage this
men who are faced with death almost every day of their lives
must have an incentive
i suggest you get some rest mr standing
good night
good night
-bye dad -bye son
giddyap
women what are we waiting for
screaming
come on come on
come on come on
come on come on here
no
oh no no
laughing
mr hench aint exactly enjoying himself matey
matey
up to your usual tricks again i see mr hench
he attacked me when i wasnt looking captain
a very strategic maneuver if i may say so
it doesnt seem to have done him very much good
-are these people friends of yours -they are friends of mine
this was going to be a peaceful mission
it was unfortunately human nature is apt to determine
where peace ends and strife begins
mr hench you will consider yourself severely reprimanded
laughs
reprimanded eh
just like the blooming royal navy aint we captain
we are ready to leave mr standing
-not with me -very well
i think we can probably find our own way to the settlement from here
-your purpose in going there -we made a bargain
we made a bargain when i didnt know you and now i do
as you observed earlier mr standing we are pirates
and sometimes we are inclined to harshness
however there is one thing i will not tolerate and that is mutiny tie him up
matey
with your permission mr standing we will now leave
dad
daddad
no timothy no
you cant help him
dad they killed him
go and find uncle henry and tell him what happened
go quickly go
uncle henry
-uncle henry -what the matter timothy
some men killed my father
-they killed him some men-wait now what men
i dont know ive never seen them before
-jonathon was with them -jonathon
-are you sure it was jonathon -yes
-where are they now -they went towards the settlement
-are your mother and sister all right -yes
take my horse and go to the settlement
warn them they may be attacked ill go to your mother
get out of here
ringing
god has seen fit to warn us of catastrophe
let us like noah take heed
-our island has been invaded -what happened father
blackthorne has been murdered take the children to the great hall
get to the stockade get your guns arm yourselves
the gates close the gates
come and get the guns
-what    -all right dont push
armed with the gun
all right take it calm
you take up positions muskets arrange up on either side of me
take the powder
right away you 90-
load your muskets
hold your fire until i give the order
if youre trying to assess their chances of fighting us off
youd do well to look at the men around you
how many firearms do you suppose your friends have
mr standing
if you want to save them from annihilation go and talk to them
tell them that if they resist me they can expect no mercy
tell them to let us in
so you can rob them of their possessions and slaughter them all
if i kill it is to achieve a purpose not for the sake of killing
-you have my word on that -your word
well mr standing
as you say if they resist the result will be the same
a wise deduction
i wish you every success
get moving
there must be 30 at least
all armed i imagine
weve got about 5 muskets between us
god is on our side
they come in peace
god has answered our prayers
why it jonathon
father i have a message for you from the leader of these men
-who are they -they are pirates i am their prisoner
ive been forced to give you an ultimatum
proceed
they are looking for plunder
they believe there are riches in the settlement
theyre obsessed with the idea that there treasure
-you have told them this is true -no how could i when there is none
they will be convinced only if you allow them to search
-and if i refuse -they will attack
father i beg of you surrender
it the only chance of saving the lives of our people
this is a trick he in league with them himself
whatever i have done im no traitor my father knows this
allow him to think and speak for himself
-what is your answer -this is our answer
gunshot
jason hold your fire
take aim
open fire
the captain wants you
-mack -right mate
take six men and work around to the back of the stockade
round up the women and children
tom
the horses
jonathon
the gates
come on
those men at the back there come here and fill these positions
mason mason
jason stop firing
cease fire stop
stop cease fire
-cease fire -hold
hold your fire hold your fire
-hold -hold it
-cease fire come on -hold
forby look after the horses brocaire deal with the settlers
the rest of you stay with me
get them inside
-jonathon jonat-get back
get them all back
laughs
fortunately for you i have a reason for keeping you alive
which of these men is your father
i am jason standing leading elect-man of this settlement
if your reason for coming here is to find loot or treasure
you will search in vain
i am of a different opinion
wealthy refugees seldom leave their treasures behind
tell us where it is and we will leave
what is that building
that is our place of justice and of worship
look after our friend and bring the others inside there
our terms for leaving you unmolested are very simple
there is no treasure
we shall remain here until one of you speaks
and we shall use whatever means are necessary
each day that you remain silent two of you will hang
oh no oh no
starting from now
our friends shall draw for the honor of being the first to die
come now me hearties
join in old mack game of chance come sir draw one
and you my friend dont be shy there only two of you to go
you grandpa youve had a good life you dont mind going im sure
hold them up
jason i-
captain
take them outside
no
-and clear this place -no
-no -oh no
no
youre a lucky man mr standing next time it may be your turn
the answer will be the same
we do not yield to the devil
a very noble and praiseworthy sentiment
you may change your mind when you find how persuasive the devil can be
he fair gives you the creeps dont he captain
i dont think he likes us
well maybe he likes you better than he likes me
laughing
hello me old matey
laughs
hello there having a good time have a drink
wait on mateys there wait for uncle mack
away me hearties
my she a hot little beastie this one
hey a nice slow canter what i fancy
good for the liver
come on there hey hey
my she changed her complexion since we first saw her forward
captain
gunshot
i would have done it but then i havent had to eat them
laughs
the first cut for the captain
where are you going my pretty
-leave her alone -i seen her first hench
mr hench and i said let go of her
you are not on board now mr hench so this woman stays with me
all right brocaire
if that the way you want it im a mate to this crew
and when i say do something you do it
so now i am going to slit your nose
and then we will see how you get on with the women
mr hench

no dispute captain
just a friendly argument
that right captain
just friendly
you girl
come here
up here
are you the cause of all this
i asked you a question
is it you these two men are arguing over
i dont care theyre both pigs
men laughing
-answer me please -yes

very well captain
mack

mateys clear the way for them back with the tables
jonathon

-you all right -yes
-where have they got our people -most of them are in the blockhouse
come on
five of them what do these cutthroats want
-treasure a non-existent treasure -treasure
-youre wrong jonathon it does exist -what do you mean
my father told me about it before he died
when our people first came to the island they were very rich
and they brought their possessions with them mainly gold
there one man who knows where it hidden your father
man im going inside to get some water
mr hench
start
you must stop them
it barbaric
they are fighting over you you should be honored
mate kill him
men laughing
-three left -bide your time
-how many horses in the corral -about 2
then well release ten of the boys
with us thatll make one man for each horse
im staying here
-youre what -if were going to save our people
somebody got to persuade my father to give up that treasure
-do you think you can do that -i can only try
if we do release the men dont attack the pirates until theyre in the open
theyre bound to leave sooner or later with or without the treasure
tapping
pounding
taps
oh mama
you done it
there you are
pounding
very good mr hench very good
all right girl
well go on what are you waiting for
go on
laughing
laughing
you would want to play games
bess
go open the main gate as quickly as you can
silence
-silence -shut up
so youre leaving us captain
take the carcass to the ship and put it in my cabin
and if it answers you back give it a hundred lashes
mr brocaire stand up and salute the captain
what this insubordination
captain there mutiny aboard the ship
-what punishment do you prescribe -that enough
but it mutiny sir mutiny must be punished
i said that enough
mr hench
give that man 250 lashes
he not at all well
come here
yes sir captain laroche
it mutiny sir mutiny must be punished
correct
you will learn that no one is indispensable
come on hurry up pick up some arms get the horses
gunshot
stop firing
look to the other prisoners
no doubt you are responsible for this
why didnt you join your friends
i hoped to serve my people better by staying behind
hench
-mr hench -he is here captain
where are the men who are supposed to be on guard
you will find two of them over there with their necks broken
deal with those with necks intact
double the watch around the stockade now get out
aye captain
there is one way in which you can help your people
and save their lives
find the treasure
then let me talk to my father
your father does he know where it is
-let me talk to him -very well
you have the whole night in which to talk
make the most of it
you wish to speak to me
yes father
laroche has told me to give you his final warning
he says that if you dont tell him where the treasure is by tomorrow morning
he will slaughter every man woman and child in the settlement
oh father have you no conscience
conscience
you dare to speak to me of conscience
you who have already bartered your soul to the devil
what value is life on earth at the cost of your soul
people have a right to look into their own conscience
they have a right to live
father i beg of you to show them mercy
talk to your friend the devil
ask him to show mercy
if you beg me now till the end of time the answer will be the same
you also will die father
do i fear death when i can face my maker with clean hands
and purity of thought
what would be his answer
the answer of a god-fearing man
you jonathon standing are a disgrace to our name
disciple of the devil
you would understand none of this
i curse the very day you were born
my grandfather secret will die with me
from above he will rejoice in my decision
his spirit has already entered mine to give me strength
yesterday i ordered the execution of two of your elect-men
you all know why
since then however ive made a discovery for myself
if im right about this we shall leave immediately
harming no one else
if i am wrong
remove the statue
no no
you mustnt you cant
all right get to work
weve reached bottom captain
there is nothing but rock
doesnt seem as if the treasure wants to be found does it captain
mr hench
you will see to it that no one remains alive
get up
guard the doors
no one is to escape
make haste there make haste
for the last time tell them where it is before it too late
-no no dont touch it -laroche
laroche
captain
halt
-there your gold -gold
solid gold
get back
now leave us in peace
peace
your friends who have escaped do they want peace
get this thing onto the strongest wagon and prepare to leave
yes we shall be taking two hostages with us
and who will they be
father and son
very well release these people and start to move out
all right release them
get them outside quickly
get on the rope pull
pull
theyve left the settlement henry
theyve taken jonathon and the old man
-which way are they heading -east
making for the mouth of the river back to their ship
-what about the treasure -well they had something on a cart
looked like the statue of old simeon standing the founder
that could be the treasure
if it is it mighty heavy
theyre gonna bypass the swamp and take the main track through the bush
theyll be in pine valley about an hour after sunup
that where we make our first strike
all right boys go get some sleep
what will happen to jonathon and my father
well get them out bess
im afraid im flying false colors for the moment bess
im no man of action
perhaps i think too much to be brave
that my excuse anyway
but i dont like fighting and killing and i dont like what i have to do
but now the pirates have found the treasure
why dont you let them take it away
it isnt as simple as all that bess
the treasure stands for more than just gold
to us i mean
it a
a kind of symbol of freedom
it what jonathon great-grandfather stood for
when he organized a flight from persecution
and someone thought it fit to commemorate him with a statue
somewhere along the line
greedy ambitious men have betrayed old simeon
but i think he still watching over us
and the pirates arent gonna take him from this island
not if i can help it
now youd better get some sleep yourself
snoring
laroche mr hench
get the men moving
all right get stirring
come on were moving out now
get up
and you
you too
stammering
dont push us too hard today mr hench
if you know what is good for you
the captain knows what good for him all right
yeah
dont do none of the work just gives the orders
“come here do this go there”
then takes 0 times our share when he divvying out the gold
yeah
gunshot
take cover
-here we go -charge
all of them
jonathon on the back come on
-father come on -leave him
jonathon leave him
get away
-get away from me -jonathon
i think youre losing one of your hostages captain
stop mr hench get them back here
get back here
the captain wants you all back
go on on the cart
you too
come on
one two three four five six
there are about seven or eight of them left
they know this island better than we do
-how many have we lost -six
six that leaves 5
fifteen against eight
they know this island better than we do
by my calculations we shall reach the river by tomorrow nightfall
-and then -im not a prophet
all right
get moving
-where father -look after henry
get some water and fix some bandages for the boys
dont take it so hard jonathon
i should have stayed to look after him
theyll kill him henry
perhaps that why he stayed if the statue goes
i dont believe your father would wish to live
why not
in his mind he protecting the statue not because it gold
he sees the religion and ideals of your great-grandfather
in the process of being destroyed
yes but-
well maybe all this has opened his eyes to the truth
back in the settlement he was too weak to fight the men
who have long since forgotten why we came here
jonathon a few months ago you said to me
“try and see that no harm comes to my father
whatever he done he hasnt done it for himself”
well you were right
yes i understand
i only hope it isnt too late
theyre following the same trail henry
-were all ready with the first trap -good
it too late matey
therell be more of this
unleash the statue well carry it the rest of the way
well have to carry it
isnt it time we made use of our hostage
laroche yes he can lead the way
standing
all right ill need six of you the rest of you look to your guns
look out the tree
mr hench
mr hench
what are you waiting for
the men are going to give trouble captain
at least some of them will
trouble to whom
they are scared they dont want to go on
the only other way to go is back
perhaps they would prefer that
what are your plans when you get to the river
you tell them captain
we are only a few miles from the river
when we get there we are going to build a raft
and float the statue downstream until we reach the ship
and who going with the statue captain
whoever wishes to go
itll have to be a big raft to take the statue and all of us

﻿
i grew up slowly
beside the tides and marshes
of a carolina sea island
we lived in a small white house
won by my great-great-grandfather
winston shadrach wingo
in a horseshoe game
last one around the tree is a ninny
joop joop joop come here
boys boys careful now
ill race you tom
wait up luke
there are families
who live out their entire lives
without a single thing of interest
happening to them
dont run so fast tom
ive always envied those families

the child of a beautiful woman
i was also a shrimper son
in love with the shape of boats
luke he pushing me
im not pushing her
quit pushing her
you know that
as a small boy i loved
to navigate my father shrimp boat
between the sandbars
there a rock pile up ahead
i suppose henry wingo
would have made a pretty good father
if he hadnt been such a violent man
from my mother
i inherited a love of language
and an appreciation of nature
she could turn a walk around the island
into a voyage of purest discovery
as a child i thought she was
the most extraordinary woman on earth
i wasnt the first son
to be wrong about his mother
i am sick and tired of you
leave me alone
never showing me
any respect in my own house
wait for me
listen to me lila
i dont know when my parents
began their war against each other
youre running too fast for me
move it tom
but i do know the only prisoners they took
were their children
wait you guys
my shoes are falling off
keep up savannah
when my brother sister and i
needed to escape we developed a ritual
okay jump
we found a silent soothing world
where there was no pain
a world without mothers or fathers
we would make a circle bound by flesh
and blood
and water
and only when we felt our lungs betray us
would we rise toward the light
and the fear of what lay in wait for us
above the surface
i held my breath longer than you
that was fun let do it again
i did better than yall
no you didnt
all this was a long time ago

all i want is a good plain american meal
here you go darling
now this is food lila
eat up children
so your mother fed him dog food huh
yeah he even asked for a second helping
maybe that where you got
your sense of humor from your mother
oh very funny very funny
she called today
very concerned about savannah
dont believe a word she says
she a liar
that interesting
she said you tell lies about her
that figures
you know i saw herbert woodruff
come out of your office the other day
he sure can play the fiddle
youre changing the subject again
what wrong with him
just kidding
still it hard to believe that anybody
that makes that kind of money
has troubles
are you really that provincial
oh hell yes so is savannah
when we were kids the only way
wed get off our island was by boat
we grew up on a tidal plain
a tidal plain what does that mean
tides mean everything lowenstein
they measure everything
moods seasons time to plant
to fish
to mate
it primitive biological clocks
ticking all over the place
hmm
sounds like a nice way to live
what else did she say my mother
she said that she was the one
who encouraged savannah to become a poet
is that true
jesus christ
that woman has no shame
you want to know
how she encouraged savannah to write
by burning the journals
she kept as a child
why would she burn them
because savannah was being disloyal
writing about our hideous family
what hideous about your family
are you asking me to be disloyal
if that what it takes
to help savannah yes
arent we about done
what time is it
mm-mm mm-mm
we still have a few more minutes
what did savannah do
after your mother burned her journals
well she took her finger
and she wrote in the sand
and then she wrote in the air
she began writing poetry
so mother wouldnt understand it
so in a sense your mother was right
she did help to create a poet
oh bullshit lowenstein
she created a schizophrenic
my mother shouldve raised cobras
not children
can you tell me anything good
about your parents
no
try
okay they did two really good things
luke and savannah
incredible people
passionate
defiant
not for sale
what about you
oh i was a courteous southern boy
who did what he was told
i was responsible and normal and dull
i dont know what normal is
and youre anything but dull
compared to them i was
meanwhile your sister in the hospital
and your brother dead
you must be doing something right
you can go now
hmm
time up
good night
night
women and men
both little and small
cared for anyone not at all
they sowed their isnt
they reaped their same
sun moon stars rain
children guessed but only a few
and down they forgot as up they grew
so this began a series
of confessional days
when i spun out the history
of savannah past
in order to keep her alive
by the second week
id developed the first symptom
of the new york willies ‒
the guilt that every out-of-towner feels
if he not improving
his mind every goddamn second
i made a list of things i should do ‒
museums plays
run six miles in under 50 minutes
see three foreign films
all at the same time
anything not to feel guilty
tom how old was savannah
when you first realized
something was wrong with her
about seven or eight
anything specific happen
well
my mother had a baby at home
it was stillborn
she told us it died cause we were bad
anyway we were gonna
bury it the next day
so dad wrapped it in some towels
and put it in the freezer
that night
i got up to get a drink of water
and i saw savannah sitting
in the rocking chair
with the dead baby in her arms
she was saying
youre the lucky one
because you dont have to live with us
did you say anything to her
the next day i did
but she didnt remember anything about it
when i told her what happened
all she said was
why would anyone do
a crazy thing like that
hmm
so
you were her memory even then
i guess so
uh-huh
goddamn locks
im coming im coming
yo
oh what what was that again
im learning to speak the language
of the natives here
hiya sally how it going down there
well it just sort of
blowing up a storm
oh i got the girls drawings
did they get my letters
yep they loved them
oh good did you get my letter
uh tom
i dont think it a good idea
for you to come home this weekend
why not
well im not ‒ im just not sure
that i want to see you right now
i um
i have a lot to figure out
uh-huh
what the point tom
i mean let face it
we dont make each other
feelgood anymore
right
look um
i didnt want to tell you this
on the telephone
i wanted to tell you before you left
but the way you left
there wasnt any time
what did you want to tell me sally
what his name
what his name sally
the man must have a name
jack cleveland
oh no
oh no
jesus sally jesus
jack cleveland
you mean that aging pompous hippie
from the hospital
who still rides a motorcycle
oh for christ sake sally why him
why him
because he knows how he feels about me
oh sally
this is too difficult
to talk about over the phone
uh
just think about it carefully
okay
i hardly think about anything else
good night tom
sally
what
are you really in love
im not sure
i might even be doing this to hurt you
i gotta go
dear sally
i wish the words i love you
werent so difficult for me
ive missed you
i miss touching you
i dont know what keeps me
at such a distance
im sorry i disappoint you sally
but youre right to feel that way
how else could you react to half a man
how could you not be disappointed
hell i seem to disappoint anyone
who tries to find the best in me
tom
maam
come on in here
come on lie beside me come on
youre the only wingo
who gonna amount to something
luke cant do it because he isnt smart
savannah cant do it
because she just a girl
but luke smart mama

or me
nobody knows this yet
but im an amazing woman
do you believe that
yes maam
im not gonna die in a house like this
i promise you that
something else tom
i love you

i cant help it
youre my favorite
now
this is gonna be our little secret
you keep a secret
yes maam
okay
can i go now
not till you tell me you love me
i love you mama
it took me 20 years
to tell luke and savannah about my secret
and when i did
they just fell on the floor howling
you see my mother took
each of them into that room
and told them exactly the same thing
hmm
why did you tell me that story
to prove that lila wingo would ‒
just to show why
savannah could never trust her
you mean why you could never trust her
oh well im sorry
that the wrong story
let just skip it
and ill try to think of a better one
what bothering you
global warming acid rain
the national debt
oh and my wife having a goddamn affair
with a heart surgeon in south carolina
hmm
jesus i feel like such an idiot
god i never even knew it was going on
maybe you werent paying attention
oh bullshit
now let face it lowenstein
women are more devious than men
yeah youre great at hiding things
you keep secrets you smile when you lie
you know you expect a man
to be a tower of strength
and when it turns out he got
a few weaknesses and some insecurities
what do you do you turn around
and goddamn it you betray him
so you feel that your mother betrayed you
i was talking about my wife
oh
oh god i hate this freudian crap
and it not your job to listen
to my problems anyway
and if you dont mind id like to go
youre free to leave anytime you want
good
goddamn shrink
who was i kidding
i was a champion at keeping secrets
better than any woman
until susan lowenstein came along
a man who never talked
now is doing nothing else
her questions making me
as dizzy as her perfume

i brought you up here to meet him
i thought that maybe you could coach him
a couple of days a week
you see
he never gets a chance to play
while his father around

i thought that maybe ‒
is this a job offer
yes
yes and i would insist on paying you
what would you consider a reasonable rate

i charge $50 an hour
fine ill take it
you must be a very good coach

so where do you coach mr wingo
hillbilly country
oh were a little class-conscious

where do you go to school miss porter
phillips exeter smart-ass
you didnt get to play last year did you

why dont you sit down and cool off
youve known about this the whole time
havent you
tom i find it difficult
conducting a session ‒
now this is not a session damn it
im asking you a question
youre doing a shitty job of evading it
tell me who wrote this book
what so disturbing about it
that not the issue
the issue is why you didnt tell me
it wasnt my place to tell you
your sister specifically ‒
youre a piece of work lowenstein
you know i come in here
and i tell you everything
and you withhold
important information from me
maybe it you who withholding
this is not about me
then why are you so upset
because i dont like being lied to
i dont like secrets
i could report you to the authorities
have your goddamn license suspended
tom stop acting like a petulant child
you havent answered
my question lowenstein
tell me who wrote this book
why dont you tell me
oh ill tell you
my sister wrote it
it all about my goddamn family
if my mother ever read it shed rip out
savannah pancreas with her teeth
why why would she do that
what are you all hiding
i dont answer any more questions
till you answer mine
then why dont you sit down and listen
that is if youre not too exhausted
by your temper tantrum
mm-hmm
oh shit
the first few times
savannah came to see me
she told me her name was renata halpern
oh jesus
she even crazier than i thought
shut up or i wont continue
she told me her father was a furrier
and that both parents
were survivors of the holocaust
now she couldnt fool me
about being jewish
but what fascinated me was why
she chose to be the child of survivors
what was she trying to survive
what is she trying to survive
well how the hell would i know
i think you do
come on lowenstein youre supposed
to be answering my questions
why did she do it
something about writing that book
made her want to become someone else
and that was okay with you
it was not okay with me
i told her unless she resolved
her own problems
no one else shed become
would have a chance
is this what people pay you to do
turn them into someone else
youre not listening to me
you havent heard ‒
bullshit
what do you think im doing here
complaining avoiding pointing fingers
oh fuck you lowenstein
fuck you and sigmund freud
and my sister renata halpern

rare footage
from the savannah wingo archives

where did you find this
i was snooping around and i found em

wait wait who that luke
yeah that luke
he was always horsing around
oh here our graduation
what from grade school right
yeah right grade school
did you always jump in
with your clothes on
yes
as a matter of fact we did
and that your mother lila
yeah that miss lila
mm-hmm
she was very pretty
she still is
so who took these pictures
my father
you see bought this camera one year
thought hed give up shrimping
the only thing he was good at
and make a fortune in film
dont ask me how
savannah said that um
your father was always losing money
is that true
oh that an understatement
henry wingo had the opposite
of the midas touch
everything he touched turned to shit
what is that tell me what that is
that is one of my father
all-time cockamamie schemes
what
well you see
he bought this gas station
he thought this tiger
would draw people by the thousands
all it did is scare em the hell away
uh-huh
the only one that wasnt afraid
of that animal was luke
he fed him
took care of him
he had a lot of courage
what about you
i didnt need any i had luke
oh this is our island
the only place dad ever really owned
at the time this was taken
it was worthless
not to luke though
to him it was
the most precious place in the world
when he was older he went to vietnam
he came back a hero
swore hed never leave it again
he didnt
what happened
my mother got the island
in the divorce settlement
she immediately sold it
to the government for a lot of money
they wanted to put up a power plant
luke went crazy he made some threats
the government laughed
he blew up a construction site
they quit laughing
and then
he went on waging his own private war
hurt some people
savannah and i tried to stop him
but the government stopped him first
shot him in the head bingo
would you like a cold drink
maybe a beer huh
how did you deal with his death
i shut down like a broken motor
hmm
and according to the southern way
still no tears
oh i cry sometimes lowenstein
i cry at weddings at the olympics ‒
im real big at the national anthem
but not over luke
what the hell for
it wouldnt bring him back
no but it might bring you back

most restrained thing i could say

we breathed a word about it
was the minute
she stopped being our mother
told us morning would come and everything
would look nicer in the sunlight
and after we buried the bodies
i went in there to check on savannah
to see how she was doing
she was trying to do what mama had said
trying to act as if nothing had happened
putting her hair up in rollers
whatd you all do tonight
only her dress was on wrong side out
im busting my hump
while youre playing with a dimwit dog
when my father came home for dinner
boys pay attention
we sat around and ate
as if nothing was wrong
eat up now
god help me
i think the silence
was worse than the rapes
three days later
savannah tried to kill herself

before i met you i was in a deep sleep
and i didnt even know it
im afraid
of what sweetheart

ive sampled the merchandise

hmm
oh my god

yeah
if we stay together

of course not
herbert not jewish
hey i dont mind
everybody in my family doing it
there luke up there somewhere
you stupid asshole
when i was a kid
he seemed like a god to me
how do you see him now
like a man
with limitations like the rest of us
except you lowenstein youre perfect
i am far from it
no
oh i look back on my life
and i realize
that ive been paralyzed for the last
god knows how many years
i mean how could i have stayed
in a marriage like that
well you had a son
oh yeah
there were reasons but
none of them good enough
i just
i just never thought that
this was possible
and now i
i wake up in the morning
and i spend my whole day thinking
isnt it nice just to feel good
i mean i hear you
walk down the hall towards me
i cant stop smiling
i smile all the time
i love you lowenstein
can we go back to the cabin
and make love all night
you still have a lot to learn
about the outdoors
im glad you brought me here
hey lowenstein says
she gonna let you go home soon
hmm i think im ready
what about you when are you going home
well i dont know
sally and i are having problems
oh no im sorry tom
i thought i might stay up here
for a while
you in new york
i cant imagine that
you could never leave the south
well you did
yeah
but i dont love it the way you do
come get me
you have to go under the water
hello
oh hi sally
uh-huh
she called you
well
we knew this day would come didnt we
but youre never quite
prepared for it
just hold me please
i feel like im dying
one of the things
i love about you is that
youre the kind of guy
wholl always go back to his family
oh
i gotta find me a nice jewish boy
you guys are killing me
you okay about going home
i think so
good
i started a new book of poems
oh good
im calling it
the prince of tides
and i dedicated it
to somebody very special
oh luke would appreciate that savannah
i dedicated it
to my brother tom wingo
my memory
oh thank you sweetheart
oh thank you
lowenstein why are you making it so hard
you just love her more
admit it
no lowenstein
just longer
we spent our last few hours together
at the rainbow room
dancing a slow dance
just like in my dream
i held her in my arms
as i told her that it was her doing
that i could go back
six weeks before
i was ready to leave my wife my kids
i wanted out of everything
but she changed that
she changed me
for the first time
i felt like i had something to give back
to the women in my life
they deserved that
daddy
daddy home
hi daddy
daddy did you bring me anything
so i returned to my southern home
and my southern life
and it is in the presence
of my wife and children
that i acknowledge my life my destiny
i am a teacher
a coach
and a well-loved man
and it is more than enough
in new york i learned that i needed
to love my mother and father
in all their flawed outrageous humanity
and in families
there are no crimes beyond forgiveness
but it is the mystery of life
that sustains me now
and i look to the north
and i wish again that there were
two lives apportioned to every man
and every woman
at the end of every day
i drive through the city of charleston
and as i cross the bridge
thatll take me home
i feel the words building inside me
i cant stop em
or tell you why i say em
but as i reach the top of the bridge
these words come to me in a whisper
i say them as prayer
as regret
as praise
i say
lowenstein
lowenstein

his own daughter to launder money

theyll scrape you off the floor
with a putty knife
his name benny garucci
he an ex-karate champ
id like to bust his fuckin head open
with a crowbar
but youre gonna have to hold him
he a tough son of a bitch
i wonder why shapiro needs
that kind of muscle here

the whole fuckin marine corps
standin by to protect him
if he wanted to
that fuck owns half of manhattan billy
i wouldnt mind teaching garucci
a little lesson in manners someday
ladies and gentlemen
laura shapiro marketing is very pleased
to introduce to new york city
the sensational edmund wong
and his fabulous collection
of shimmering cocktail wear
nice dress
nice tits
everybody on the floor
dont move back off
no
no
new york finest
cant even keep a girl from being snatched
tight out from under your goddamn noses
we had our guns out
you might as well had your dicks out
for all the good it did
ill take my dick out
when im going to use it captain
we couldnt shoot
without hitting the girl
i think you two men
did the right thing
well thank you sir
any word from shapiro
he has no idea why
his daughter was snatched
weve been monitoring his phone
for the past 2 hours
no ransom demands no orders nothing
you might find this interesting
what is it
a record of all the phone calls made
in the last 2 hours
by shapiro hood benny garucci
six calls all to the same number
country code 8-5-2
hong kong
how the hell dya get this
friend of mine at the phone company
the blonde
no the redhead
what the hell does all this
got to do with hong kong
there somebody waiting outside
who might just be able to answer that
send in mr cantrell please
men this is bob cantrell
from the justice department
are these the men
who kidnapped laura shapiro
well how the fuck should we know
they were wearing masks
excuse me lady
what this all about
these men all work for a powerful
hong kong crime boss named harold ko
harold ko
what do you know him
anybody who knows hong kong knows ko
a real snake
yeah and a tough one to catch
now weve suspected shapiro and ko
of running drugs
from hong kong to new york for years
but weve never been able
to pin anything on them
why the hell would ko want
to snatch shapiro daughter
we dont know maybe theyve had
a falling-out of some kind
whatever the reason
there a good possibility
that laura shapiro now being held
in hong kong
it impossible nobody could smuggle
a girl into hong kong that quickly
it impossible
not for ko
he right ko got most of the island
in his back pocket
sir if laura shapiro in hong kong
we should check it out
forget it wong
my chinatown contacts can give me the names
of some good informers over there
it might be worth a try
garoni could come with me
he knows hong kong from his vietnam days
youre way out of line wong
like it
if you men could find laura shapiro
and pin it on ko
you might just be able to shut off
the largest heroin pipeline
to ever come out of the orient
okay we got nothing to lose
why dont you two men go to hong kong
as special advisors to the local police
and see what you can come up with
yes sir
see you captain
thank you captain
thank you
here the keys to that jeep
you asked for
thank you
you sure you dont want a driver
no were okay
thanks for getting this through customs
for us inspector we really appreciate
superintendent whitehead will meet you
tomorrow afternoon at four
you got it billy
yeah thanks see you tomorrow
thanks a lot inspector
{billy good night sleep well
man you love it
we could stay at a better place you know
were on an expense account
nostalgia billy my boy nostalgia
memories of magic nights on r&r
i remember during nam
there was nothing around here
but a bunch of horny grunts you know
and the women billy
the women madam mia
and besides nobody gonna look for us
in a dump like this
what that
an old chinese coin
a friend of mine in chinatown
gave this to me
it sort of a calling card
yeah
yeah
looks like a bunch of shit to me
i still say it ludicrous
the idea that anyone could smuggle
a girl into hong kong
without my office knowing about it
is simply impossible
improbable not impossible
now listen to me you two
i spoke to your captain
and he told me
about your dodge city tactics
we dont appreciate people like you
in hong kong
i want you to assure me
that youll behave
with the utmost discretion
discretion is my middle name sir
show them out inspector
yes sir
thank you sir
gentlemen you must forgive
the superintendent
he been trying to nab ko for years
considers it a personal mission in life
i think he worried you will succeed
where he failed all these years
dont worry about it inspector
im used to pissing off superiors
we ran down the phone number you gave us
shanghai massage parlor
that where benny garucci called
from new york
apparently it a rough place
they dont necessarily specialize
in giving massages
if you know what i mean
you bet your ass i do
let check this place out
maybe we can shake ko tree a little
billy youre a mind reader
you two be careful
one of the reasons ko has managed to stay
out of prison for so long
is he doesnt mind killing anyone
who threatens him
if he thinks youre getting too close
to finding laura shapiro
your names will be on the lips
of every assassin in hong kong
it a friendly little town
you got here inspector
welcome to hong kong
this is my favorite part of town billy
were supposed to be working garoni

to see garucci here

mare important business to take care of
you follow garucci

whatever you say kid

you youre the cause of this
you killed my father
no i didnt kill your father
harold ko killed your father
i hate you
if you hate me then you must hate ko
help me find him
help me destroy the man
who killed your father
father
my father told me to help you
even though he dead i must obey
the fortune-teller was a friend
of my father
if my father found out anything
the fortune-teller will know
you look for a girl
that was taken from new york by mr ko
how do you know
the i ching tells all
nothing is hidden
there has been war
between ko and shapiro
yes but the war is over
a man has come across the water
to make peace
benny garucci
yes
my people tell me
a pact will be made tomorrow night
and the girl will be returned
where the girl
i do not know
but you must not look for her
the i ching is not good
i see only danger
death and betrayal
thanks
wait a minute
i must say a prayer for my father
and consult the i ching
what do your sticks say
is the fortune-teller right
i ask the questions billy
but i never read the answers
close the gate
thanks
i trust you found the girl well
yes sir just as you promised
when mr shapiro refused to pay
for my last shipment
i lost much face
i trust it will never happen again
it was a simple misunderstanding sir
be assured that mr shapiro remains
your faithful friend and partner
he wishes no ll feeling towards you
im glad to hear this
but mr shapiro is worried
those two cops from new york
theyre getting too close
to our operation
calm your fears
the girl shall be returned to you tonight
as for those two police officers
they caused me great dishonor
they will be taken care of
garucci went to this big container shipyard
before he went to see ko
now it my guess
he was checking on the girl
before arranging an exchange
with the big man
the fortune-teller said the exchange
will be made tonight
so we have to break in and get
the girl out before that can happen
tall order man

why did your brother have to get to carloon
in a big hurry
i cant talk about it
well whatever it was he did
you got left here to die
while he was doing it
it didnt happen like that

how did it happen then
i cant talk about it no more
just stop asking about everything
cause i believe in god
and i know henry believes in god
and there no harm
henry would want to see me come to
i believe in that
yet look at the harm youve come to
and where henry
he waiting for me
he not waiting for you
yes he is
no he not
ill tell you what god given you
he put a bullet in you
and he abandoned you out here to me
who feels nothing for you
i couldnt give a fuck if you die tomorrow
god gave you a brother
who not waiting for you
he gave you a brother who
not even thinking about you right now
just because you and him
came out of the same woman hole
the only thing
that means anything right now
is that im here and he not
your brother left you to die
that what people do
you dont learn to fight
your death gonna come real soon
this is 5- passage is called 2-
we should be clear or clearing shortly
4-3-7 echo
4-3-7 echo this is k-k do you copy
stop shooting
i just wanted to fight
i just wanted to fight him
let go
come on
that lady said it would take about
eight hours to get there in the old days
but it might take longer now cause
a lot of them old roads aint there no more
and all the roads are bad now anyways
so you cant drive fast on em
she said about eight or nine hours
she wasnt sure if it was eight or nine
she seemed a bit confused about it
and why would he still be there
he had to wait two weeks for someone
there a man there he got to meet
it gonna take two weeks
you know this or this is what he told you
your brother cant be trusted
is this something that you know
or is this something that he told you
both those things
you work in the mines
no
what do you do then
i was a farmer and now im here
then how come you learned
how to shoot so good
you was in the army
when i was a little kid i grew up on a farm
we had these neighbors
real old man and lady verna and clarry
they brother and sister
and they lived on this land
that all overgrown
like you couldnt even tell
what they farmed so overgrown
and clarry had these eight tractors
and none of them worked properly
so every morning hed roll each one down
the hill till he got one of them started
and then use that one
to tow all the others back up
he did that every day
and when they died
their family who wed never met before
came around cleared out their house
and they found all this
they found all this weird stuff in there
like
like 50 therm
thermionic radio valves
like them real old valves
they used in old radios
and pyramid of pumpkins
and about 5000 of these little sticks
about this long
and each wrapped up in newspaper
and tied up at the ends with baling twine
why are you telling me this
i just remembered it
it interested me
not everything has to be about something
im tryin to stop thinking about that
little girl who died but i cant
you shouldnt
but i cant
you shouldnt stop thinking about her
you should never stop thinking
about a life youve taken
it the price you pay for taking it
that it sweetheart
let start with the eyelids
i want you to roll over onto your front
put your hands behind your back
and do it slow
and do it now
when are you gonna say something cunt
it over
it over for you
i know that
that good that you know that
do you know it too
i know it champ
i told you it
do you know it over for you too
whatever you think over for me
was over a long time ago
im asking about you
are you threatening me
no
a threat means
there still something left to happen
what are you gonna do with me
youre going to sydney
why dont you just shoot me
why dont you do it
that what everyone else is doing
because me sending you to sydney
tells sydney there a reason
to keep paying us what they pay us
if we just shot every idiot
we wanted to shoot
then pretty soon theyd start to wonder
what the fuck were doing out here
see personally i dont care about you
i dont care if you get to sydney and
they let you off or you bribe your way out
or whatever the fuck they do down there
these days
i dont give a fuck
im doing this for me
youre doing what for you
youre doing what for you
i murdered my wife
i followed her to a man house
i watched him put his fingers inside her
and i killed em both
no one ever came after me
ten years ago
i never had to explain myself
i never had to lie to anyone
i never had to run and hide
i just buried em in a hole and i went home
no one ever came after me
and that hurt me
more than getting my heart broken
knowing it didnt matter
knowing you can do something like that
and no one comes after you
you do a thing like what i did
that should really mean something
but it just doesnt matter anymore
well champ
thing you did in abo town is the one thing
that does matter to us
now you can do
all the lying and confessing youd like
what feeling do you have
when you wake up in the morning
when your feet touch the floor
or before that when youre lying there
thinking about your feet hitting the floor
what does that feel like for you
do you know what im talking about
no mate i dont
you dont
no mate i dont know
what the fuck youre talking about
what the fuck
is that it
that was easy
do i shoot him again just to be sure
no
that was easy

they were just hanging there

slipped underneath the fence

michael i already paid for this year

ive roomed with for five years

redding is a killer he the dean of
third year he gonna bust my balls
mike what say we share
notes again this year
you take mine you mean
michael suzanne
beautiful
forget it gant
here you go partner
thanks
im dr david redding dean of
third-year studies and chief of surgery
you know every year i look
out at the group assembled here
and i ask myself
the same question
why would anyone knowingly
do this to themselves
for the next year
your days will not end
the work will never stop
your rank will command
absolutely zero respect
and worst of all
after it over
you will be faced with
the horrible realization
that there is nothing
in your medical career
that will ever be as rewarding
as third year
third year is like
being an 8-year-old rookie
and being called on to pitch the
seventh game of the world series
blindfolded
doesnt get any tougher
just remember though that
none of you would be here
if you werent pretty good
rookies to start with
now for survival purposes
you have been divided into small groups
that you will stay with all year
through each of your rotations
the very best in each specialty
will be selected to enter
residency in that area
there are three internships
in pediatrics
two for ob-gyn
two for internal medicine
and one and only one
for surgery
that my little
neck of the woods
your future will depend on how
many honor grades you accumulate
during the course of the year and
whether or not you honor in your specialty
size
i know that very important to you
for me the only thing
that really matters
is making you into
the best doctors possible
because it is hands-on from this moment on
people for the rest of your professional days
well doesnt everybody
look official
im bobby im dr redding
physician aide
it my job to show you people
how little you really know
and i love my job
every morning you will be at the
hospital an hour before the doctors
to check on your patients
primary care
then the entire team with your
resident will make the rounds
during these sessions you will be pimped
pimped
pimped questioned
probed and humiliated by the residents
for interpretations
diagnoses complications
cases that are really juicy will
be reviewed in grand rounds
which is the same as regular rounds except
that everybody in the house is there
if you intend to make honors youd
better know your shit on grand rounds
ive been in this place
a long time
and ive never seen anyone
screw up grand rounds
and come out
with honors nobody
daily summaries are on green paper
permanent summaries are on red paper
please observe the following
demonstration closely
unlabeled blood specimens received
in the specimen receiving room
will be processed as follows
nurses heads rns
lvns nurse aides
it is easy to confuse them
dont
hi
hi
talking allowed
im glad youre enjoying
the privilege
seeing as how we didnt do
too much of it our first two years
i thought now that were in the same group
we could make up for lost time
michael youve convinced me
youre very charming
thank you
but im afraid youve got it
got what
surgeon ego
what is it a disease what
you look to be a classic case
your personality already fits the prototype
and what that
as a group theyre narcissistic
insensitive chauvinistic
and their only definition of
success is to win at all costs
im dr margaret kennan
chief resident of ob-gyn
you will begin the first of
your rotations in my domain
the patient is a 23-year-old gravida
para 0 ab-0 40 weeks gestation
noted one week ago to have
frank breech presentation
external versions
attempted two times failed
so she been admitted
for elective c-section
buenos días señora
ola
dr hayes why is this patient
having a c-section
well
if she were well dr hayes
she wouldnt be here
dr wyler
because the
external version failed
delivering a breech presentation might
expose the baby to unnecessary injury
and what injuries are those
dr rose
nerve damage prolapsed
cord and delay in delivery of the head
what about the possible problems
with doing a c-section dr chatham
aspiration from anesthesia bleeding
infection pulmonary embolism
good
i knew that
some help here
dr kennan seventh baby
got hung up in admitting
she not gonna make it to delivery
okay
get over here
hold her up for me i want you to
breathe just breathe now push
push big push big push
yeah dont stop
breathe in
breathe in
here it comes
big push
hey yeah yeah
good girl relax
you have a beautiful perfect little baby boy
wow
a baby
youre here people
is it too late for law school
all right kenny patient
mrs thompkins
twenty-three weeks
gestation noted hayes
top left
is admitted for strong labor pains
dont
hayes
be careful not to touch
anything it a lab experiment
that youve been growing
for two years use mine gina
so now what if
the ultrasound shows abruption
then the bleeding
will probably stop
okay but what happens
when she begins contractions
do an amnio on her
determine the baby age
in case she needs a section
there no need to do
a tap on her this soon
why dont you just try to stop labor and
see if you can carry her for a few weeks
no way youre wrong
no im right
if it was an abruption
the odds are that the bleeding will stop
and if you can stop her labor
shell probably go to term
i mean there no need
to risk a tap right away
youre right
what are you drinking
herbal tea it from pakistan
you can probably
smell it in pakistan

sure
may i ask you a personal question
mr chatham
i know your father a doctor
these loans are gonna weigh on you
for a good 0 5 years of your career
why dont i just get my dad
to pay for it
we dont have
that kind of relationship
it doesnt work that way

henrietta walker
interesting case
yes sir
cancer patient
im gonna put her
on grand rounds for monday
hello mrs walker im dr michael
chatham your student doctor
just wanted to come introduce myself
ive had some blood work ordered
a nurse will come up here
shortly and take some samples
it might hurt for a moment
but itll go away
i see youre a an elementary
school teacher what grade
mr chatham
i realize this is
a teaching hospital
but since i do not want you
practicing dramatics at my bedside
please drop this transparent act
of the concerned doctor
you will find this infinitely
easier on both of us
if youll concentrate on being direct
accurate and to the point
i know what i have
and i know why im here
i dont need hand-holding
is that understood
yes yes
drink
hayes
thanks buddy
listen why dont you take a break in
about an hour well grab some dinner
you gotta eat or youre gonna be
worthless for grand rounds tomorrow
i cant man i gotta check
on miss walker in an hour
ill get something later
yeah that what i thought youd say
so from suzanne
tell her i said thanks
yeah
gina contribution
i think youre makin
real headway with that girl
get outta here
are you gonna eat that sandwich
yeah
just checking
right
any time dr chatham
yes sir
the patient miss henrietta walker
is a 49-year-old female
presents with sharp epigastric pain
nausea although no vomiting
this has been increasing in the last three months
physical findings
distended abdomen
with diffused tenderness
shifting dullness
and a fluid wave sign indicating ascites
what workup was done
cat scan shows a mass in the area of the stomach
endoscopy and biopsy test
positive for gastric carcinoma
well what your assessment
dr chatham
a large gastric carcinoma with
possible spread to the greater omentum
all right she your patient
how would you treat her
give her several courses of chemotherapy
what else
wait for significant improvement and attempt surgery
all right
let take a look
at the patient
henrietta
dr redding
i have some friends
with me here
let take a look
tell me if i push too hard
dont worry
i wont hesitate
im sure you wont
how are the cats
splendid
any new additions
none since the siamese
ive decided it time
to put my house in order
in case i dont come home
this time
that an admirable thought
but one i think
you could put off
for the immediate future
all right
well i think dr chatham
assessment on the money
questions
i have a question sir
yes
dr chatham
what if there intestinal
blockage secondary to metastasis
tests havent revealed that
what tests
cat scan liver and bone scan
lfts sma-2
those wouldnt necessarily
reveal intestinal obstruction
or possible pleural effusion
which from your presentation
could be included in this assessment
that a good point
dr rose
all right let order an upper
gi series for mrs walker
thank you henrietta
doctors
are you all right
i was expecting to be attacked
but not by someone in my own group
well kenny a fighter he
probably had to fight all of his life
you know it funny when
kenny a tough-ass competitor
everybody says it all right it
okay look where he come from
he had it tough so what
if he an asshole about it
gina if i had pulled a stunt like he did
today in there id have been crucified for it
why because your father
a surgeon
-michael -look it doesnt matter
okay it not important
all that matters are end results
who the best i dont like to lose
kenny may have fired the first shot
but im gonna win this war
michael
the tests suggested by dr rose
have all been run on the patient
all prove negative
thus supporting my initial assessment
that the patient
miss henrietta walker
begin a prescribed chemotherapy
regime beginning in two weeks
continuing for
six concurrent weeks
thank you dr chatham
good follow-up questions
finish up with your patient
dr chatham
and then meet up with us in rounds
yes sir
well i think
that is what is referred to
as a hollow victory
im sorry i guess sometimes
we get carried away
it the competition
it im sorry
no need to apologize
it entertaining
you know i could have gone
to a private hospital
pension and disability
are pretty generous
when youve been a teacher
for 25 years
i chose to be here
why
because this is a teaching hospital
and being a teacher
i relate to the process going on around me
it it makes me feel less sick
like im back in my classroom
so how am i doing teach
youre doing pretty well
dr chatham
just dont concentrate
so much on the facts
facts are pretty important
around here
so are people doctor

medicine i havent decided yet

you do for a couple of hours
and then go home
and be with the kids

in there tough for a woman to take
i see youd have to

dr chatham
it was great working with you
it a pleasure working with you
thanks good to meet you
so youre doing well here
honoring
well so far in everything but
medicine there some stiff competition
youre in one of the best med schools
in the nation whatd you expect
i remember when you were in the
national 4-and-under tennis finals
you breezed through the first
four rounds without dropping a set
then you came up
against that kid gomez
you remember
yeah
he beat you the first set
and then you let down
you were better you were
much better than he was
but when you let down he took advantage
of you and he beat you three straight sets
afterwards i never saw you drop
your guard again dont do it now
that was 0 years ago howd
you remember that kid name
it was a pivotal moment
you always remember
the pivotal moments
good to see you son
you too dad
draft please
sure
hi
mind if i sit
meeting someone
no
sure
here you go
thanks
sure
why is it that when a guy comes
into a bar to be alone with his drink
no one thinks twice about it
but when a woman comes in alone everyone
assumes she waiting to be picked up
why is that
i have no idea
you know your father
really is a terrific surgeon
i guess youve heard that
a million times
yeah
about a million and one
you know
i was eight years old before i found out
his first name
wasnt doctor
all the time
that he lived at home
i used to go to the hospital
and make rounds with him
i loved the way people
there treated him they
like he was royalty you know
dr chatham we need you for this
dr chatham
we need you for that
it wasnt long before i realized those
people knew him better than i did
and i wanted to be just
like him and as good as him
i mean so that
he would talk to me too
what gets me
worse than anything
even now
like today when i see him
yeah
i feel exactly like i felt
when i was eight years old
im still trying
ill leave you by yourself
what do you recommend
dr hayes
well given the little
girl allergy to penicillin
i recommend we start her
on erythromycin
sounds good
here you go sweetheart
well have you feelin better
in a flash bye-bye
thank you doctor
be well
for your cough
all you need to do is when you go home
grind up about seven or eight
peppercorns and mix it with some honey
itll take care of your throat
really
yeah
ill try it
okay
peppercorns and honey
is that some new combination
they taught you in pharmacology
well
i -what do you suggest after that
eye of newt
three eagle feathers
jump up three times
and bark at the moon
it sort of a secret
family recipe actually
well i suggest that you keep it just that
dr maloney a secret
you see when a patient
receives information from you
they perceive it
as coming from a doctor
and you are not a doctor
what specialty
are you heading for
well i was hoping pediatrics
good luck
let me tell you about
the stars in the sky

all right now people
now the tension
is so thick in here
that i dont know whether
to cut it or the patient
can we just concentrate
on the operation thank you
all right now today
we have a simple cholecystectomy
if we dont traumatize
the surrounding tissue here
we can have this patient
going home in a couple days
you ready dr ballentine
let do it
okay scalpel
dr wyler id like you
to perform the honors
now if you can just make
an incision from here to here
okay from here to here
okay that okay
it all right
ill take it
all right the incision is made
here in the midline from here
at least he had the decency to wind up on the floor
vivian
yes
hi
lauren hi
hi lauren
hi
what are you doing here
i got off early
i thought id bring something we
could have dinner together is that okay
i dont have time
to take a break
not even to eat
i grabbed something earlier
i asked you if it would be okay if i
stopped by and you said it would be
yeah i thought
it was gonna be later
yeah well it cant be later cause im
working a shift tonight you know that
i dont remember what shift youre working on
lucky you remember anything
goddamn it im working
what do you think im doing every day and night
all i want is 0 minutes with
my husband that i never see
i think were gonna take a little walk
no im sorry dont go
no it okay there
things that we need to do
it okay
it fine
dr rose what if we were to come in under
the bed of the ninth rib instead of the th
suction
we would risk traumatizing the pleural space
possibly resulting
in a pneumothorax
what other approach
could we use hayes
well the patient has
a very large tumor
and the added exposure by going in
through the ninth rib would lead me
hang in there hayes
come on buddy hang in there
im fine im fine it would
lead me to use that approach
i think youre right
are we all in agreement
pressure looks good
two-silk
suture
dr chatham
what if the patient were to spike tonight
in post-op and develop a distended abdomen
clamp
worry about intra-abdominal bleeding check for sepsis
what kind of workup
would you do
complete cbc look for
an increase in white count
get a blood culture
urine culture chest x-ray
more suction please
very good
hemostat and sponge
cut
damn vivian
hayes
how are you feeling
i feel like we gotta
get out of this rotation soon

on that table myself
redding thinks im an idiot

if you find that entrance line
humorous or calming
we have a major problem
well youll like
this one better
the chemo worked
we shrunk the tumor
what does dr redding say
he got you ordered
for surgery in a week
he also ordered you a new
diet and some supplemental fluids
to get you up
to fighting strength
he thinks im too weak to
make it through the operation
no it mainly to help you
after the operation
i told you before
id have none of that
of what
bedside lying
miss walker
youre going to be just fine
that better
i almost believed you

dont i know you from somewhere
hey stranger
hi
hi
wait wait
he got his operation tomorrow
wait michael
come on
where
let go
what
where are we going
michael
my god
tie this
vessel right here and
cut this
scissors cut
what do we have to
watch for here rose
superior mesenteric artery
cut right here
scissors okay
it completely
encased the aorta
we cant get it out without
compromising the intestinal blood supply
well what did the pre-op
ivp show
the mass didnt cross
the midline
all right
were out of here
isnt there
something we can do
you know dr rose
sometimes you have to know when to quit
and hope to come back
to fight another day
maybe after some chemo
we can come back in here but
close him
two layers of nylon please
shit
go ahead
man close him up
suture pick-ups
how ya doin
look there no way
you can test for that
it not your fault
come on
what do you care
what are you talking about
i could have tested for it
i shouldve thought of an angiogram
next time
what do you mean next time
youve got it
wrapped up chatham
im gonna stay at nell
i left the number on the table
for how long
i dont know a while
i just gotta get through
this year on top
you knew that
this would be hard
i knew youd have to work i
didnt know youd have to resent me
i dont resent you i
kenny every time you walk in here
and im waiting for you you resent me
every time i call you
you resent me
every time we go out with your
friends and i dont have anything to say
forget it you dont hear
and i can take that
what i cant take is how this
goddamn competition has changed you
you havent made me
a part of things
the patient weight is 20 pounds
hemoglobin is up to 07
however future weight gain will not be
as dramatic falling off by 20 percent
therefore offsetting any advantage that
we may gain by delaying the operation
very good
dr ballentine and i are gonna do our little
work in the or so we can get you out of here
well it about time everyone
stopped talking and did something
i agree dr ballentine is
gonna be performing the surgery
and ive also asked dr chatham
to scrub so he can assist
so well all be seeing you
in the or
okay spirits up
are you nervous
no
that was good
i am scared
dont be there no reason to be scared
everyone here is the best you
dont need to worry about it i promise
okay
okay
i promise
okay
tie that blood vessel there
debakey pick-ups
suction
clamp
chatham what would you do next
go through the omentum to the lesser sac sir
right
dr ballentine why dont you let
dr chatham work in here for a little while
come on chatham
metzenbaums
metzenbaums
hemostat
hemostat

connect the
esophagus to the jejunum
and how do you plan
to drain this
with a long ng tube
and multiple drains
let get all the packs out of
here and take a sponge count
dont wanna leave anything in there
yes sir
can you wrap up here
i got a plane to catch
all right thanks very much
people youve been great
dr chatham
yes sir
you did real good in there
thank you sir
why dont you
close up shop for us
yes sir
dr chatham
report to post-op
dr michael chatham
to post-op
sarah how she doing
i checked her last 20 minutes
ago there definitely a dip
dr ballentine leave any instructions
no
thank you
dr ballentine
sir dr ballentine
what
henrietta walker condition is getting worse
her blood pressure dropping
her pulse is thready
and her urine output
is very low sir
that just third spacing after
abdominal surgery it happens all the time
sir i know about third spacing
i think this may be cardiac
dr ballentine
report to er stat
dr ballentine to er
stat
just increase her fluids
and keep an eye on her
sir i was thinking
what about adding dopamine
if we did it would increase her
chatham you think too much
just increase her fluids
how is she doing
bp way down
and urine output almost at 0
what are you gonna do
dr ballentine excuse me i need
to talk to you about miss walker
i cant right now
sir she not responding
we have to do something
do what
she not dehydrated sir
she in cardiogenic shock
she needs some dopamine
to increase her cardiac output
sir i learned
about this in medicine
look every third-year student
thinks their patient has
what they just learned about
shell respond to the fluids ill
get up there as soon as i can
when that when she codes
get the hell out of here
look the best thing you can do is
just let it go and hope for the best
did you try redding
no i cant reach him
he on a plane somewhere
youre stuck man
it ballentine patient
he the doctor
chances are he right
what if he not
you cant buck protocol
theyll kick you out youll lose
the internship everything go home
youre beat there
nothing more you can do
stat
waiting on a co-signature
do you have any idea of the
seriousness of what youve done
yes sir broke protocol
you cut yourself off
from the hospital
you challenged and overruled
a resident of mine
whose experience outweighs you
by quite a few years
sir it was clear miss walker was not
responding as expected to the medication
her readouts were extremely low
i had to do something
no dr chatham
dr ballentine
had to do something
he was also aware of the
factors affecting her condition
and it was his studied opinion to
continue the medication as planned
sir he was not aware
well then it your
responsibility to make him aware
at the moment i thought the patient life
was more important than the rules sir
what would you have done
that not the point
i cannot run a program
where a student is allowed
to act on his own
no matter how good his intentions are
i would rather accept the
responsibility of breaking the rules
than losing
a patient life sir
and if your choice had
proved to be incorrect
would you have been prepared to
accept the responsibility for her death
saving someone life does not
make you infallible dr chatham
were human
we make mistakes
i think you have the makings
of a fine doctor
but you havent even begun to experience
the complications of a human body
now until youre able to understand
the limits of your knowledge
im not gonna allow you
to practice in this hospital
youre suspended from all duty
until further notice
yes sir
i dont believe it
i counted it up i spent 68 hours
away from this place since we got here
that 28 days
i dont know where to go
hey
we need goblets on 6
you got it
you doing okay
yeah
how school
chatham got suspended
what happened
broke a rule
he went against ballentine
so i guess that makes you
number one
congratulations
the day you left
i operated on this guy
we opened him up
and there was nothing we could do for him
i felt so helpless
i would have done anything
to help that guy
michael felt the same way
the thing is
he saved ballentine ass
but he getting screwed for it
i dont know
what important anymore
except i know
that you are
do you think youre coming home
dad
michael
what are you doing here
your mother called me
i wanna know what happened
i made a decision
that what happened
there a lot of people who
think i did the wrong thing
i know i did the right thing
im prepared to accept
the responsibility
listen when i
was starting out
i wanted to believe that
medicine was an exact science
but there are
too many variables
too many random possibilities
i finally understood
that my instinct
was as important
as my knowledge
that actually my knowledge
informed my instinct
and that i should trust it
it took a lot of courage
to believe that
but i knew that if i turned my back
on something i really believed in
that id never be able
to live with myself
if you did something because
you really believed in it
you did the right thing son
is your hearing tomorrow
yeah
come on
let talk about it
dr chatham the facts of this
incident are pretty much on the table
except for one area
why dr ballentine didnt respond to your
request for examination of mrs walker
i cant speak for dr ballentine
sir
would you say that you had a close
relationship with the patient mrs walker
i knew her fairly well
fairly well
she was my patient
during my medicine rotation
ive followed her progress
for the past several months
and you kept up with her case even after
you had moved on to a different rotation
yes sir i was
interested in her progress
do you think it possible doctor
that your relationship with the patient
might have clouded your reasoning
and caused you to be unduly alarmed
perhaps even overemotional in
your conversations with dr ballentine
no sir that impossible
i responded to the evidence
michael is there any reason
that youre aware of
that dr ballentine didnt
respond to your prompting
dr ballentine is
an excellent physician
he been in this situation
numerous times
now given that information can you think of
any reason why he should ignore your advice
no sir i cant
thank you doctor the
board will review the information
dr redding will make a final
determination in a day or so
you may go
thank you sir
dr redding
hey rose
congratulations
on the internship
it not official yet
but it will be way to go
it was a pleasure
working with you sir
dr redding
dr rose
about michael chatham
i thought you should know the problem
between him and dr ballentine is personal
michael been seeing
gina wyler
dr ballentine
had been dating her
are you implying that dr ballentine
would jeopardize a patient
because of a problem
with michael chatham
im saying it a factor
that hasnt been taken into consideration
in michael chatham suspension
you understand if what youre telling me
has any bearing at all on his suspension
youre the one that has
the most to lose by it
i guess that why im here
im the most credible person
you could hear this from
habit
she doing fine
gonna be released next week
yeah
michael
hi
hi
i came by but you havent been home
ive been out
are you okay
yeah im fine where are you working tonight

listen i heard you talked to redding
yeah dont hold your breath
he wasnt knocked out by it
whyd you do it you got
the internship wrapped up

asterisk up next to my name

suspension has been removed

motivated out of a set of circumstances

have i been sleeping
i was dreaming
it funny
i always thought dryland floated
or drifted with the wind
that why it was so hard to find
why did you believe in it so much
cos we werent made for the sea
weve got our hands and our feet
were supposed to walk
i miss her sound
dont you
gregor helen

the numbers yes i think i do
it seems to be some ancient form
of geographic location
latitude longitude
it doesnt make sense though
the numbers
they seem to be backwards or something
it upside down
the world
the poles have reversed themselves
ive been mapping the cities below
the world wasnt created in a deluge
it was covered by it
man that blasphemy
no it true
ive seen it with my own eyes
there land
right under our keel none of it dry
some is
enola been there i know that now
i saw what she drew

ill bring her back to you
woman forget about the muto helen
if he brings her back theyll kill us
weve got to go help him
i cant ask him to do this alone

hi harry
morning rick
breakfast
just some cofee thank you
any luck
eh yes and no
kanda is dead he died a few years ago
he didnt have any relativesso
well at least you know it
youve been jumping as scorpion
ever since you got here
what now
-i would like to try something else
good  do you want a safari
maybe but i couldnt afford much one
afford nothing
my pleasure
might not want this rick
may take 4 or 5 months
4 or 5 months
yes im going north to the kalaoyana country
do you wanna die young
will you come along
you wanna try for king solomon mines
yes
i thought itd be something like that
-why
-youre alan son
youre all tied up inside
you spent 3 sweating weeks
trying to track down kanda
by finding him buried ahead
they didnt bring back any diamonds
there no prove for the story
my father wouldnt lie
neither would my mother
youll have half of the diamonds
if we make it
your life should be worth more than
a half of some possible diamonds
me sure i got nothing to lose
and many to gain
youre worst than your father
he pushed his luck and  africa got him
even him
yes i know
but i think he was lucky
he died doing what he wanted
seen everything done everything
his time had come is such simple
he is still buried somewhere out there
its as good a place as any
the last place im gonna be buried is in africa
i dont think you have a choice
is in the cards or is not
im going to find the mines
why
diamondsmoney is the only thing that
counts in our days
do you think so
there no much left
of the world i knew
so im gonna try for something different
if i fail
but if i find them
im gonna contruct my own  world
-youre nice and cinical  arent you
-well arent you
you know youve never been
on safari before
true but i know every end of the way
of my father
every foot of it
second hand knowledge
wont keep you alive
youve ever seen one of this
no
umbopa king of the watusi
who guards the mines
gave it to my father
if we make get into their country
were home free
yeah if
ive never been in or near of that country
no one has  except your father
you know well have maybe
one chance in ten of getting there
let alone getting back
probably one in fifty
the whole idea is crazy
jim-jim
yes bwana
i told you a million times
to keep that thing out of here
-well take it outside
-yes bwana
stinking country
ive tried house snakes to keep the others away
all right so i dont like snakes
well sure i got nothing to lose
except my life
no family nothing sure ill come
i was really hoping youd ask me
why
possibly the diamonds
here youd like to use this
no thank you
ill just use my own rifle
an army rifle
youre married to that
sort of
captain h quatermain
kosb
king own scottish borderers
oh a kilt and all that
yes ive got very pretty knees
i didnt know officer carried rifles
they dont actually
but i found it much more useful
especially with the bayonet
hi glad you could come over
i want to introduce you to
a friend of mine harry
he been around  this country
for years
might be useful to have another
gun along
he is lousy shot
harry quatermein
wilhelm von kintner
if mr cobb had told me
i could have saved you a journey
we dont need another gun sorry
that a lee enfield i see
is it yours
yes
good luck rick and safe journey
thanks for coming over
you know harry we could have used
another gun
maybe but well handle it ourselves
what the matter with you
youre still fighting the war
no four years was quite enough
it is just personal
my mother and sister were drowned
in 96
an uboat got their ship
a lot of people died unnecessarily
that right but in this case
i had to identify their bodies
my sister was still in her mother arms
she was 8
just a childshe had no legs
no legs just stumps
my mother had her child
half a child in her arms
i know he had nothing to do with it
but i just dont want
anyone of them around me that all
jim-jim
you lead harry
ill take the wagon
harry
whats the matter rick
my feet
do you want some help
im sure better at desk job
never did like walking
strange
hynas always hunt in packs never alone
kalaoyana atacked the white god
white god
-is there any mission settlement around here somewhere
-yes  there is
wed better bury them
you didnt find a body of a woman
by any chance  did you
no
only eight natives and the missionary
that leaves only one posibility
ill take jim-jim
oh no you dont   jim-jim
yes bwana
if were not back for sundown
come and find us
come on
-she wasnt as lucky as the others
-what do you mean
kalaoyana like to torture women
cover me
all right
come on
well never be able to hold this bridge
or leave trying to make a run forth
there only a vill up ahead
well have to risk it
we can never hold them here
all right but leave the wagon
we dont have too much time
-let just take what we need
all right
im rick cobbare you all right
i think so
but theyll come back
yes  im afraid so
im erica neuler
i do not know how
i dont know how to thank you
well thank him
too bad about the missionary
i know he was my father
im sorry

-think you can go on
-i will try
ich muss ihnen danken
i mean im very grateful
erica neuler
this is harry quatermein
thank you for saving my life
we havent done that yet
youre german
yes
wont be long now
better get some clothes together
be prepare to travel light
where will you take me
never mind no questions just keep going
well have to fire that bridge
fire is a pretty dangerous thing
to play around with in this country
well ill set the rods
well just have to risk it
all right
you think is safe to camp now
yes i think so
what that
the river must have carried
the fire down stream
were lucky the wind is blowing
away from us
were right in their path
quick behind these rocks
come back here
get down  down come back
come back
get down get down
we did keep off the vultures this time just
yes the gods are with us
long way to get through yet
-long  why where are we heading
north
where are you going to leave me off
you cant expect us to turn back now
well leave you off at the end of our safari
it is not usual to find
europeans in this area
youve been here long
many years
even during the war
we saw few europeans
i was lucky you came by
almost a miracle
go easy with the water
this isnt berlin
we may not find drinkable water for days
im sorry i should have known better
yes you should have
what have i done to him by
he should be like this to me
what have i done
maybe he just dislikes germans
it looks like a good place rick
yes
well camp here jim-jim
yes bwana
do you know how far is it to zampari
about half day march  id say
but were lucky i know there
elephants spot about a mile back
youre looking for ivory
no no
but the elephant meat is a delicacy
to the zampari
if we bring them meat they ferry us
across the river
is the only way we can get across
oh i see
does the haupman permit me to bathe
i was a captain
captain  haupman it is all the same
never was to me
nontheless i wouldnt bathe
in the river if i were you
you are afraid i may poison the crocodiles
oh do you consider dirtiness a merit
with us germans
i didnt say that
you did
look erica why dont you
stop picking on him
then tell him to stop
picking on me
i am a human i exist i am here
it is not my fault
and not asked to be rescued
maybe i do not like him as much
as he dislikes germans
i am not ashame of being german
my father told me to be proud
why dont you forget it
youre the only one
that keep bringing it up
i know im sorry
youve been so kind
i will try
it is going to be dificult
because he is such a
dickkopf
how are your feet
few blisters not too bad
good
-rick are you coming
-yeah im coming
you do like him dont you
sure he my friend
-jim-jim
-yes bwana
get some of the boys
and bury the tasks
well pick them up on our way back
were going to get back
do i ever say different
mamba
second hand knowledge eh
say you are a genius
did you have good hunting
yes
you look good
i mean clean  rested
thank you
id use a bath myself
i organized the food i hope is all right
i baked some bread
bread here
all you need is flour and water
it easy to make an oven
out of clay
i smelled something good
do you know why the kalaoyana
atacked your mission
there been much trouble with the change
from a german east africa to a british  protectorade
many of the native tribes
didnt like the war years
it wasnt only the natives
we happened to be germans
whove blamed
sometime innocent people suffer
yes
are you sure there is nowhere
i can be left
you know there isnt
youre quite safe with us
dont worry
but i do
for the first time i have the chance
to live my own life
and do not intend to throw it
way just because you want to go north
you have no alternative  have you
you know my idea of heaven would be
reunite all the mosquitoes in the world
and burn them to death  slowly
real slow
are the flies that make me ill
getting in your hair in your eyes
in your food
hey you better take this
dr quartermain i presume
someone has got to look after you
im fed up with quinine
how about yourself
i already had mine
my idea of heaven would be
a constant hot water
flowing from silver taps
where is always clean
and green
where the rain falls gently
and where you can go out in the sun
without hat on and not be afraid
you know  i left the old country
seeking for a good climate
i figured africa was the place
with the time i found out it was too hot
whatever i was stuck with it
funnywe always wanna be
somewhere we are not
anything would be better than this
you know ive never had a pretty dress
never in my whole life
no silk stockinsive never been to the ballet
or theater
ive never read today paper of today
-im sure youd get bore with it
-no i wouldnt
what your idea of
heaven
this without flies and mosquitoes
youd get bore with that too
what are you looking for north
were going to king solomon mines
you are gone through all of this to find
the will o the wisp
king solomon mines
komisch sehr komisch
it funnyvery funny
do you know how ironic it is
why
a fitting end to everything
a trip off to nothing
maybe it kind of crazy
not if we got there
she a fine girl isnt she
yes
have you been married rick
no and you
no
i cant stand much more of this
neither can i
youre doing fine erica
how much more
another five or six days
well make it all right
if the fever doesnt get us
keep going
harry  harry
harry
fever
get the quinine jim-jim
there none bwana it was lost
in the stampede
all except for one small bottle
that nakuma son bwana took
what
the crazy it has been giving it all to us
we better go to the falls
cannot be more than a
half day ahead
there give me a hand
-hello rick
-no quinine  nothing
if we dont break his fever
i think he will die
how do you know youre a nurse
i ran the mission hospital
my father told me about it
i wonder
perhaps we can find  mimtoyali
any good
no
maybe there arent
in this part of the country
there must be
give me a hand rick please
we got them rick
raise his head
thank you
well  if that doesnt kill him
nothing will
sometimes  this natives
remedies are good
-it should break his fever tonight
i hope so
jim-jim
it a  watusi it must be
just like harry described it
i cannot undestand him
it bengkala he says his name is
amtagka has come to guide us
he want to see harry
harry why
he told me politely
to mind my own business
he is asking if he will live
yes
he said  he will wait
how could he possibly know
about harry
i dont know strange things
happen in africa
there not much a white man can do
without words passing from drum to drum
do you really believe
solomon mines exist
sure his father got there
and lived to get back
if he dies what will you do
id like to go on
would you come
i would have no alternative
i like have you around erica
thank you
how do you feel
much better thank you
-ill tell rick youre awake
-no nodont
id like to sleep a bit more
good night then
good night
no she not my wife
im sorry i didnt know you were taking
i cant hear you
i want to talk to you
down there all right
-is anything the matter
-no erica
im sorry i interrupted you
i thought something was wrong
i didnt even take time to dry myself
what did the watusi say
only that he been sent to guide us
that wed be welcomed
will it take long
no  it wont take long
by the way rick told me
how you broke my fever
i wanna thank you
we have quite a time with you
my mother died of the same swamp fever
we didnt know about mimtoyali then
we had just arrived to áfrica
sorry sorry about
your father
he was living on borrowed time
so many years in the
jungle all alone so far away
he knew it would come one day
but he stayed
it was quick when it came
so i think is all right
i didnt think i was going to be as lucky
for that i thank you
were you born in germany
yes  we lived in freiburg
i can just remember the little church
at the edge of the green forest
all the cattle wore bells
and at sundown
we could hear them over the whole valley
its was beautiful
-was your father sent here
no he asked to come
my mother beg him against it
she wasted so quickly
and since i was eight
i was mother to the mission
my mother also died
in africa when i was born
when my father died
my step mother took me to canada
i always remember my step mother
she is dead also
yes she and my sister were drowned
in 96
their ship was torpedoed
by an uboat
oh i see
im sorry
i wanna thank you for saving my life
i would do the same
for anyone
black white german or english
what did he say rick
it a watusi proberb
two virgin and one man
is only good
but two men and one
will destroy all three
he is very wise
we should have caught up with amtagka
hours ago
i hope nothing has happened to him
no he too clever for that
jim-jim
what the matter with those bearers
tabu land  theyre afraid  bwana
tell them we are well armed
there nothing to fear and keep them quite
better not shoot yet
the sound will carry 20 miles
were lucky theyre half blind
and almost deaf
yes  but we better get out
before he sense us
i waited as long as i could
but he wouldnt go away
as long as youre all right
bwana
the boys bwana theyre gone
what
he said he saw the bearer deserting
why dont you stop them
he says the bearer were afraid of going
to the land of the little people the pygmies
why
pygmies are too small to hunt games
with weapons
so they build  traps
from now on itd be like going thrugh a minefield
i will check our suplies come on  jim-jim
ill give you a hand  rick
harryfor god sake stophelp
no harry
let me go
look
harry
oh im so sorry harry
but i thought that you
that the trouble
youre always got the wrong thought
it was just that i
we got a mad woman in our hands rick
ill have to watch out myself
good night
good night
good night
oh  it smells good
breakfast is nearly ready
im so hungry i could eat
an elephant raw
where did you get the eggs
one thing about the army
they teach you to survive
there you are
rick
yes
wake up
what the matter
im afraid this one is a bit too ripe
an egg is an egg
im sorry about yesterday
about weeping and all
oh you can use my shoulder
anytime you like
or maybe harry
how about some breakfast
thanks
amtagka says well get to the
desert in a few days
after that watusi country
and the diamonds
how about split it in three ways rick
it all right with me
this is very kind of you  but
youve earned this share
you do not owe me anything
only my life
look out bwana
it broke his neck
yeah that wouldve been mine
is there anything we can do
yes bury him
this damn thing never keeps it edge
how do you keep that thing sharp
melissa
i work out it
melissa
after my sister
harry do you mind if i say something
just as a friend
no go ahead
you know youll never be wholenever be content
while you force it all to remember
i dont have to force it that my trouble
mistakes were made on both sides
during the war
that right but that doesnt help me
you know youd like my people
theyre
theyre what
oh nothing
if we get those diamondsim going back
to the old country
it must be 20 years since i left home
i dont have a home
everyone has to belong somewhere
or somebody
otherwise there no point
erica is all right  isnt she
yes she is
id like to marry her
why dont you ask her
i have no courage
you like her too  dont you
yes  i do
that makes it kind of rough  doesnt it
no it doesnt  i couldnt marry her
nothing gonna stop us noweh harry
-only the guards
-they are on our side
well i hope so
if they are  youll be the richest woman
in the world
i dont know if i want to be that rich
if theyre not  we end up as dust in the wings
of the wind
i like the simplicity
i dont
how beautiful
how wonderful beautiful
my father said it was a paradise
but  i didnt expect it
i wonder what well find down there
you you harry and me
i wonder what well find
whatever were looking for
he asked if we came for
the little white stones
sealed
the only safe way to the diamonds
is sealed forever
i cannot undertand him
he said that the only passage
to the mines
is through the kingdom of fire
the mines are tabu for
his people but
he promises to help us
if we still wish to go
yes  i want to go
itd be funny if after all weve been through
the diamonds werent there
theyll be there it got to be
i have the feeling that it wont be
that easy
before we go  there something
i wanna get settled
you mean erica
yes
umbopa daughter
gave me the dress
the women wear them
you look wonderful erica
you dont like it
ive never really seen you in
a dress before
it quite a shock
a nicer look
it nice to be a woman again
i think ill take a walk good night
look erica
do you like some
oh no thanks
perhaps by tomorrow well have
the diamons
is that so important to you
yes and  no
look erica im pretty beat up and im not as young
as i used to be
without the diamonds  ill have to earn my
keep as a hunter
if we get the diamonds
youll be wealthy too i thought that
youre not beat up rick
youre a wonderful man
youve been so kind to me
you both have
what a meant was
will you marry me
even if we get the diamonds
we have a long way back
it so dificult to think clearly
with so much dangers around
not for me it isnt
you and  harry
sometimes i dont know what i see
what do you mean by that erica
all my life ive been told what to do
it was so easy then
now  i dont know how to make
a decision
it beautiful here isnt it
yes and so peaceful
ive never been anywhere
quite like this
so calm eternal
everything out seems so unimportant
i feel the same
this land isnt like africa
rick wants to marry me
rick is all right
are you going to
we have to go back
this heat will fry us
we can make it across
wait im going first
where next
wherever the tunel lead us
you are all right erica
yes for the while that there
the way back will be safer
we can find the cave
look were here
it unbelieveble
fantastic
we made it weve got it
now we can do anything
now we got only get them out
well get them out all right  come on
how much do i have to take
two handful will be enough for all
of your life
and the life of your children
this one is for a house
and this two for some land
how big is it your land
this one  no it too small
this one  have a mansion
i like my little house
-and this for all of constant hot water
and this for all the dresses you want to buy
and silk stockins and hats and everything
and this is for a car you must have a car
i never drove it one
oh and a chauffer eh harry
right
this will pay his wages for the rest of his life
erika
-it only
you have been so kind
both of you so very kind
but im afraid we may not get out of here
nonsense were almost home already
another half hour and will be out
in the sun come on
there should have been a stream there
well have to go back for where
we came in
what do you think harry
you jump first rickthen erica
youll help her land in the other side
each jump gonna make the rock shake loose
you think itll be safe

in real trouble
ill worry about that
come on keep going
youre wasting time

we cant fight about it
no but if i had to
i would do get you across
now come on

it ever your own way
youre as stubborn as your old man
youll be all right are you ready
im afraid
if you make it ill make it
ill try
thanks
lets get out of here
umbopa is giving us another 20 bearers
well make the coast in fine shape
i can hardly wait to start spending
now that i got them they dont seem
so important anymore
they will in a month or so
what the matter
youre all right
do you remember when we got the crest
erica said
i wonder what will find down there
welli found something down here
i dont want to let go off
this place
im not going back rick im staying here

are you crazy
what for
almost everything i want is here
i think this is the one place in the world where
i can find content  peace of mind
do you think you found the paradise
yes
ill tell you one thing for sure youre all mixed up
youll never find any paradise or peace of mind
while youve got that thing around

im going to say something that i needed to say for a long time
im your friend harry  aint i
of course
no wonder
im as german as she is
german
sure
i was brought up in england but i was born in germany
same as my folks from way back
i wish id known
i tried to tell you many times
but i never seemed to find the right moment
would this have changed  if i had
after now i dont think so
no i didnt think so either
why didnt you tell me this before
maybe i had to prove a point
i was a friend of your father
that right  i thought hed told me everything about you
he had
everything that he considered important
it didnt make any difference to him
he judged a man as a man
he was right he was so very right
im sorry
how i must have hurt you
both of you
forget it
erica looks like we are now on our own
harry is not coming
are you serious
yes
bwana
coming  amtagka
maybe you can talk and sense into him
will you be staying a long time
i dont know
maybe a year maybe more
i guess ive taken from my father more than i thought
this place makes me feel so at home
i can undestand why
it so gentle and peaceful
it not just that it
i think rick is right im all mixed up by
there only one way
to live for today
today must be the world
eternity and everything
well  youre coming
i think we are both staying
ive heard it all
youre both crazy
erica youre going to stay
if youll ask me
it because today i suddenly believe
that i love you
today i believe ive loved you for many days
only today is important
well  arent you gonna ask her to stay

good luck to both of you
im proud to have you as a friend  rick

and i couldnt deal with the cops
so i told him i had a fight with my boyfriend
and maybe he could just take me home
then he told me he was a schoolteacher
great with my luck hell molest me
he gave me his handkerchief to wipe away the blood
the only thing he wanted
was to know if i needed anything
i hated asking
but i needed some money
he gave me 20 bucks his name and his address
i guess he thought hed never see it again
but i sent it back with a new handkerchief
and i wrote him this little thank-you note
just a line to let you know that im okay
but he never wrote back
one look at my spelling would scare anybody off

it funny the first time i saw him all stretched out on the bed
with his skinny little chicken legs and his wrinkled little butt
i mean i practically peed my pants
just six swats that was all he needed
easy money
i must have a talent for it
i should open up a torture chamber
i make him beg for mercy
there was this one day right
his grandchildren were there
he told them i was from the welfare department
that he had to show me around the house
we left the kids watching tv and we went upstairs
we couldnt do it in the bedroom cause the lock was broke
so we did it in the bathroom
but i couldnt get a good swing
it was just too narrow
glass shatters   liz laughs
i broke a fucking light fixture
he was so sweet he always gave me something
i mean you know besides the money
usually something from the garden
i know it stupid to get involved with tricks
but he well he a client

moaning continues

sighs
ive lost countof how many ive had

moaning continues
i used to love sex
i used to loveeverything about it
now when i go to bed
all i want to dois go to sleep
and i bet youive had more sexin places like this
than ive ever hadin a bed
i should writea book about it--
the toiletsi have known
i met my best friendin one
well she was
i was working downtown
hanging around looking for tricks
when this girl comes along acting like she stoned
or drunk or something
and then i see the blood and i just look at her
and i say what the fuck
and she just says blake
and i see the bastard had cut her
right across the stomach and then i thought
if i dont do something fast she gonna bleed to death
so i go rushing her into the theater
and i yell to the chick in the box get an ambulance
i guess she must have just got the manager
cause after a while this bitch comes busting in and starts laying into us
calling us dirty filthy sluts
and im trying to stop the blood but it just wont fucking stop
and the poor girl she starting to go into shock
and the manager yelling at us
about aids and trying to kick us out
without getting too close of course
but the blood just kept coming
and then in comes katie
she sorta took control right away you know
i mean even got the manager to help out
she told her to imagine it was her daughter
if it wasnt for katie
i dont think the girl wouldve pulled through
katie wanted to know why she didnt go to the cops
i laughed
i told her blake pays the cops to look the other way
anyway he got her a few weeks later
but this time the knife went straight through
that was a terrible week
i dont know what the hell i wouldve done without katie
she looked after me like a sister would
if i wouldve had one
sometimes i wonder why my parents ever had me
they mustve been drunk
i guess i was why dad left home
katie was the only person
i ever knew that never wanted
i wanted i needed
there were nights i needed so badly just to be held
for my birthday
katie bought me a book
nobody ever gave me a book before
it called animal farm
and im telling you it just like life
it about animals but it not for kids
it the best book i ever read
well it the only book i ever read
and on the inside cover she wrote
to liz
with love and all beautiful things k
sometimes i used to open it just to read that
i just loved being with her
she even turned me on
to serious music for a while
music playing
she was so smart
she could make almost anything sound interesting
katie worked as a bartender
she made good money but what a waste
i mean she went to junior college
i kept telling her she should get a good job
like a teacher or something
shed make a great teacher
god i wish i had her brains
and i told her that
she said there nothing wrong with my brain
only my education
my education
that cant be right
cause i hardly finished school
i mean i havent been in school for so long
that i cant even remember anything
man moaning
that was the end of katie and me
woman smacking lips
sharp as a razor
and id use it too
once id use it on myself
but now id fight back
that katie
man moaning louder

and point-blankhe denied it
practically knockedmy goddamn teethdown my throat
me and my girls
i look after em
im out all hourskeeping an eye out on em
just to make suretheyre safe
i drive aroundjust checking

or as i tell you
they dont come cheap
sniffs
so how muchyou say he takes
00%
mon it likeyoure gettingscrewed twice
hmm
look it just likei was managing a factory

even factories treattheir employees better
at leastthey get benefits
mm
but it still a factory
with employees
and somebody like merunning things
i got what they call
entrepreneurial flair
i can see a need
and i fill a demand
the man is a slave driver

everybody starts off
by thinking theyre gonnamake a lot of money
and get out of itin a couple of years
but it never happens
you just stay doing it
ive seen some pretty kids
with faces like dogsafter only six months
you know
they say you can tell a womanthat been doing this
that it shows in her face

in my eyesthat where it startsthey say
in the eyes and thenin the mouth all hard
theyre wrong
yeahtheyre full of shit
you better believetheyre full of shit
yeah theyre full of shityou know why
because itstarts in here
it like a cancer
and then it just startseating away at you untilthere nothing left
just an empty shell
theyre oversexedand theyre born like that
nature rejectsfrom the moment that theycame into this world
all they have to offeris their bodies
so they might as wellget paid for it
theyre bornwith a price tag
if somebody gave ema million bucks
theyd be back onthe streets in a week
they canthelp themselves
there nothingyou can do about it
it like being bornblack or white
it just the way they are
i must be some useto somebody

that chris
handsome isnt he
he so smart
he six now
yeah he atthat age where--
well you knowhe grown up and
well if hewas living with me
how would i explain it
i meani work at night
so you could sayi got a night job
but then when i go to jailand i dont come homeduring the day
i meanhow do i explain that
everybody says he smart
you should hear him read
he knows all the animals
i taught him that
he loves animals
he sent me this paintingof his cat
this is mandyhe wrote on the back
she sleeps inthe washing machine
he with a nice couple
they dont haveany kids of their own
he was sort of adopted
after my mom died
the courts saidi was an unfit mother
yeah that wheni moved on
chris seemshappy enough though
i wish he was with me
but i can see himwhenever i want to
but i have to call firstbut
uh i dont go back theretoo much
it kinda upsets me
last time i went back there i didnt tell him i was coming
i stood outside his school
and waited for the class to end
he was wearing the jeans id sent him for his birthday
theyre probably still a little too big for him
but hell grow into them
his foster mother rachel
she was there waiting to take him home
i could hardly stand to see him go
but i dont think
ill go back there again you know
no not for a while anyway
i dont want chris growing up hating me
i dont want him to be ashamed of his mother
i know he calls rachel mom
but he knows whohis real mother is
what i wouldnt givefor a nice cool shower
no chris is better offwhere he is
for now i know that
he looks just likehis father
were still married
chances are wed stillbe together if he hadntcheated on me
i never cheated on him
hey what i do isnt exactlymaking love is it
hate would be closerto the truth
i meanit isnt even sex
because sexhas some feelings
i mean if you like somebodythat sex
well i dont likeany of these shits
no there must bea better word for what i do
but i dont knowwhat it is
it mechanical
no feelings
no
i mean maybe if you reallypsyched yourself up for it
you could feel something
who wants togo through all that
i meanwhen i was younger
i used to make believe
somebody out herewas loving me
but then i got to the pointwhere i just hated tricks
i hate em
and they dontlike us neither
i mean really like us
oh they want us all righti didnt say that
but like usno no way
