and i couldnt deal with the cops
so i told him i had a fight with my boyfriend
and maybe he could just take me home
then he told me he was a schoolteacher
great with my luck hell molest me
he gave me his handkerchief to wipe away the blood
the only thing he wanted
was to know if i needed anything
i hated asking
but i needed some money
he gave me 20 bucks his name and his address
i guess he thought hed never see it again
but i sent it back with a new handkerchief
and i wrote him this little thank-you note
just a line to let you know that im okay
but he never wrote back
one look at my spelling would scare anybody off
especially a schoolteacher you know

it funny the first time i saw him all stretched out on the bed
with his skinny little chicken legs and his wrinkled little butt
i mean i practically peed my pants
just six swats that was all he needed
easy money
i must have a talent for it
i should open up a torture chamber
i make him beg for mercy
there was this one day right
his grandchildren were there
he told them i was from the welfare department
that he had to show me around the house
we left the kids watching tv and we went upstairs
we couldnt do it in the bedroom cause the lock was broke
so we did it in the bathroom
but i couldnt get a good swing
it was just too narrow
glass shatters   liz laughs
i broke a fucking light fixture
he was so sweet he always gave me something
i mean you know besides the money
usually something from the garden
i know it stupid to get involved with tricks
but he well he a client

most of the menwho come in heremust be married
and they come here
because well dothe things
their wivesand girlfriendswont do

i meani dont see why
a woman would havea problem
with stickingher man cockin her mouth
i meani guarantee you

i bet you
he got his eyes shut
thinking of his wife right now
moaning continues
me
i dont wanna see another dickas long as i live
ugh
sighs
ive lost countof how many ive had
must be miles
moaning continues
i used to love sex
i used to loveeverything about it
now when i go to bed
all i want to dois go to sleep
and i bet youive had more sexin places like this
than ive ever hadin a bed
i should writea book about it--
the toiletsi have known
i met my best friendin one
well she was
i was working downtown
hanging around looking for tricks
when this girl comes along acting like she stoned
or drunk or something
and then i see the blood and i just look at her
and i say what the fuck
and she just says blake
and i see the bastard had cut her
right across the stomach and then i thought
if i dont do something fast she gonna bleed to death
so i go rushing her into the theater
and i yell to the chick in the box get an ambulance
i guess she must have just got the manager
cause after a while this bitch comes busting in and starts laying into us
calling us dirty filthy sluts
and im trying to stop the blood but it just wont fucking stop
and the poor girl she starting to go into shock
and the manager yelling at us
about aids and trying to kick us out
without getting too close of course
but the blood just kept coming
and then in comes katie
she sorta took control right away you know
i mean even got the manager to help out
she told her to imagine it was her daughter
if it wasnt for katie
i dont think the girl wouldve pulled through
katie wanted to know why she didnt go to the cops
i laughed
i told her blake pays the cops to look the other way
anyway he got her a few weeks later
but this time the knife went straight through
that was a terrible week
i dont know what the hell i wouldve done without katie
she looked after me like a sister would
if i wouldve had one
sometimes i wonder why my parents ever had me
they mustve been drunk
i guess i was why dad left home
katie was the only person
i ever knew that never wanted
i wanted i needed
there were nights i needed so badly just to be held
for my birthday
katie bought me a book
nobody ever gave me a book before
it called animal farm
and im telling you it just like life
it about animals but it not for kids
it the best book i ever read
well it the only book i ever read
and on the inside cover she wrote
to liz
with love and all beautiful things k
sometimes i used to open it just to read that
i just loved being with her
she even turned me on
to serious music for a while
music playing
she was so smart
she could make almost anything sound interesting
katie worked as a bartender
she made good money but what a waste
i mean she went to junior college
i kept telling her she should get a good job
like a teacher or something
shed make a great teacher
god i wish i had her brains
and i told her that
she said there nothing wrong with my brain
only my education
my education
that cant be right
cause i hardly finished school
i mean i havent been in school for so long
that i cant even remember anything
man moaning
that was the end of katie and me
woman smacking lips
sharp as a razor
and id use it too
once id use it on myself
but now id fight back
that katie
man moaning louder

all of a suddenhe starts kissing me
man i never kiss nobody
you never do
i meanill suck their cockthey can lick me
they can fuck mebut no kissing
and no fingers neither
i mean you shouldsee their nails
i mean who knows wheretheir fingers have been
no suckingmy breasts neither
so anyway this guyhe starts trying to kiss me
so i said to himhey man i dont kiss
he didnt seem to mind
all of a suddenhe says to me
lowered is it nice
i said to himis what nice
lowered he says this
and pushes it ineven harder
now i know he wanted me to talk dirty right
i was still pretty new to the game i didnt understand
so i said it all right i guess
lowered  all right all right he says is that all
and then he pulls out so i asked him why he pulled out
and he says  lowered  because youre not enjoying it
i said hey i dont have to enjoy it
you paid for it you enjoy it
and he goes  lowered  but i cant enjoy it
if i know youre only doing it because i paid you
well if you want passion that costs extra
by then his time was up so i asked him if he was finished
lowered  finished he says
i havent even started yet kiss me
so he yanks my head and he starts trying to kiss me
and im trying to push him away and then he starts shouting to me
lowered  you fucking cunts youre all the same
youre dead all of ya no feelings
and then he starts trying to kiss me again
then he asks for his money back
i said sorry no deposit no return
then i tried to get up and get out
suddenly he grabs my bag with one and my hair with the other
and he starts banging my head against the floor
i mean i thought my fucking brain was gonna explode
im telling you he must have slammed my head about six times
before that damn door finally opened
you oughta be more carefulwith who you date
that when i realized
you cant workwithout a pimp
so i becameone of blake girls

and one day i put itto him point-blank
and point-blankhe denied it
practically knockedmy goddamn teethdown my throat
me and my girls
i look after em

because itstarts in here
it like a cancer
and then it just startseating away at you untilthere nothing left
just an empty shell
theyre oversexedand theyre born like that
nature rejectsfrom the moment that theycame into this world
all they have to offeris their bodies
so they might as wellget paid for it
theyre bornwith a price tag
if somebody gave ema million bucks
theyd be back onthe streets in a week
they canthelp themselves
there nothingyou can do about it
it like being bornblack or white
it just the way they are
i must be some useto somebody

yeah he atthat age where--
well you knowhe grown up and
well if hewas living with me
how would i explain it
i meani work at night
so you could sayi got a night job
but then when i go to jailand i dont come homeduring the day
i meanhow do i explain that
everybody says he smart
you should hear him read
he knows all the animals
i taught him that
he loves animals
he sent me this paintingof his cat
this is mandyhe wrote on the back
she sleeps inthe washing machine
he with a nice couple
they dont haveany kids of their own
he was sort of adopted
after my mom died
the courts saidi was an unfit mother
yeah that wheni moved on
chris seemshappy enough though
i wish he was with me
but i can see himwhenever i want to
but i have to call firstbut
uh i dont go back theretoo much
it kinda upsets me
last time i went back there i didnt tell him i was coming
i stood outside his school
and waited for the class to end
he was wearing the jeans id sent him for his birthday
theyre probably still a little too big for him
but hell grow into them
his foster mother rachel
she was there waiting to take him home
i could hardly stand to see him go
but i dont think
ill go back there again you know
no not for a while anyway
i dont want chris growing up hating me
i dont want him to be ashamed of his mother
i know he calls rachel mom
but he knows whohis real mother is
what i wouldnt givefor a nice cool shower
no chris is better offwhere he is
for now i know that
he looks just likehis father
were still married
chances are wed stillbe together if he hadntcheated on me
i never cheated on him
hey what i do isnt exactlymaking love is it
hate would be closerto the truth
i meanit isnt even sex
because sexhas some feelings
i mean if you like somebodythat sex
well i dont likeany of these shits
no there must bea better word for what i do
but i dont knowwhat it is
it mechanical
no feelings
no
i mean maybe if you reallypsyched yourself up for it
you could feel something
who wants togo through all that
i meanwhen i was younger
i used to make believe
somebody out herewas loving me
but then i got to the pointwhere i just hated tricks
i hate em
and they dontlike us neither
i mean really like us
