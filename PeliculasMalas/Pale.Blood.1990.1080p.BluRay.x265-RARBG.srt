Mr. oswald, will you
please hold still?

6
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:29,143
Now, as I was saying, I don't
wanna bother you with details

7
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:32,605
on how I arrived at this, just
let me say that it is a work

8
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:35,532

and years and years of
single-minded dedication.

Mr. oswald, if you
can't stop shaking,

11
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:45,329
I will have to ask
you to leave the room.

This is Michael fury.

41
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,320
Mr. fury, I
have a message from Lori,

42
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,335
who says she's from
the detective agency?

43
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,303
Yes.

44
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:03,993
She's unable to
meet you but asked that

45
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,009
you join her at Metropolis,
a store on Melrose Avenue?

46
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,810
Do you know where that is?

47
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:12,056
I'll find it.

48
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,921
Have you got your passport?

49
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,705
That's the fifth time
you've asked me that.

50
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,758
Remember when you tried to
go to Missouri and you left...

51
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:23,526
Yes, yes, yes.

52
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,248
The Metropolis on Melrose.

53
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:47,596
J close your eyes,
remember me from long ago

54
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:55,604
j never say a word, no
one will ever know

55
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:02,773
j I'll think of life
the way it was before

56
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:10,661
j imagine what the future
has in store for you

57
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:17,918
j I'll take the time
to waste 1,000 years

58
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:26,005
j touch the face,
wipe away the tears

59
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,270
j stab the back, bite
the hand that feeds

60
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:09,905
Come on, there it is
back there, come on!

61
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,511
Come on, guys, let's go.

62
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,097
Vampire city, come
on, let's do it.

63
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,022
Get me some light.

64
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,318
Oh, wow.

65
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,940
All right, come on in tight.

66
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,990
Starting tight on her
and then pull back

67
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,489
and open up to include me.

68
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,571
Get him outta here, will ya?

69
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,201
Police, move aside.

70
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:36,646
This is frazer Kelly, I'm
reporting live from Metropolis

71
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,581
a Melrose Avenue lingerie
boutique and a scene

72
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,709
of yet another grizzly
feast by the vampire killer.

73
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,507
Less than 10 minutes ago,
I received an anonymous tip

74
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,507
at the channel 3 news desk.

75
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,305
The shocking tip told me
that one of the mannequins

76
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:52,633
was not a mannequin
at all, but a corpse,

77
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:56,516
and very likely the vampire
killer's victim number three.

78
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,393
We've arrived here
before the police

79
00:05:58,733 --> 00:05:59,853
to bring you this exclusive.

80
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:02,400
You must be Michael fury.

81
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:03,777
I'm Lori, from the agency.

82
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,233
The one you've been
corresponding with.

83
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,615
I'm really sorry I couldn't
meet you at the airport.

84
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,392
I got a hot tip from
a friend of mine

85
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,951
and I came right down here.

86
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,995
Looks like another one.

87
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,661
You are Michael
fury, aren't you?

88
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,683
The one who's been
paying me to investigate

89
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,830
these so-called vampire murders?

90
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,459
That's right.

91
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,052
You had me scared
there for a minute.

92
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,549
It's just like the others.

93
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,927
Someone is using
sharpened incisors

94
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,179
to bite into the
necks of the victims,

95
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,800
and all the blood
is drained out.

96
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,596
But there's no evidence,
there's never any evidence.

97
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:40,555
And they appear no closer

98
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,357
to solving the hideous crimes.

99
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:43,814
- I see.
- Now, here tonight.

100
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:44,862
Another victim.

101
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,756
This is frazer Kelly
for channel 3 news.

102
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:47,900
Now back to the studio.

103
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,572
Well, my car is right here.

104
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,366
Why don't I take
you to your condo?

105
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:52,283
That really freaked me out.

106
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:53,821
I don't even wanna eat dinner.

107
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,349
I tell you, it
makes me worry about you

108
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,658
walking out here by yourself.

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,960
Don't think I'm
gonna work here anymore.

110
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:26,518
Yes, ma'am?

111
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,319
Fill it up, please?

112
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:34,701
And the victims are apparently
killed someplace else.

113
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,574
Maybe the same place every time.

114
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,155
And then they're brought to
the place where they're found

115
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,416
and the rest you
know from my letters.

116
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,127
You want a coke?

117
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,081
Anyway, I found a great place
for you while you're here.

118
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,632
It's a brand new condo.

119
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,113
It's unfurnished.

120
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,798
That's what you
wanted, isn't it?

121
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,595
Have you seen it?

122
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,767
I spent a whole
day and night there.

123
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,139
Really?

124
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,920
Well, after all
our correspondence,

125
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,143
I kinda felt like I knew you.

126
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:08,443
My letters were very
business-like, as I recall.

127
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,773
I know, but I
like to read between the lines.

128
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:18,403
I made up a whole
personality for you.

129
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:23,166
I sat in your place,

130
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,915
wondering how you'd
decorate the living room,

131
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,167
which bedroom you'd
pick to sleep in,

132
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,124
what your bed would look
like, things like that.

133
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,546
What do you do in the agency?

134
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,131
Research assistant
on the graveyard shift.

135
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,933
All those summaries you sent
me were unusually thorough.

136
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:45,914
Well, I'm very
interested in the occult.

137
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,853
Not just vampires,
a lot of things.

138
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,652
Actually, I'm kind of a
joke around the office,

139
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,652
so when your first letter
came in, they kinda thought...

140
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,574
They thought we
deserved each other.

141
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,055
I've read all the vampire books.

142
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,445
Seen just about every
vampire movie ever made.

143
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,101
Wouldn't it be incredible
if there really was

144
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,615
a vampire behind all this?

145
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,521
You know, a lot of people
think it's possible.

146
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,231
Because of the puncture
wounds in the throats

147
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:08,495
of the three dead girls?

148
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,171
Well, you saw them.

149
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,625
They looked just like fang
bites and everyone knows

150
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,050
vampires must kill to live.

151
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,175
I think people do
see too many movies.

152
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,972
Why must what you
call a vampire kill?

153
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:27,898
Why couldn't they take
just enough blood to exist?

154
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,974
And let their quarry live.

155
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,320
Quarry?

156
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,609
That's an interesting
way of putting it.

157
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,109
I'm tired.

158
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,942
I'd like to get
to the apartment.

159
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,579
Michael?

160
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,366
What are you really looking for?

161
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,790
I'm looking for a killer.

162
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,735
Nice slow pan from
Billy blue shirt,

163
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,152
and hold, beat.

164
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:22,658
Beat.

165
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:27,907
Now nice slow zoom, real
slow, real slow, yeah.

166
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,488
That's good.

167
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:30,832
Good.

168
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:32,668
Yeah.

169
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:53,808
Now, pull back real
slow, yes, real slow.

170
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:58,942
Hell, somethin' moved
down there, I know it did.

171
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,031
Looking for something?

172
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,828
Jesus Christ, man, you
scared the shit outta me.

173
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,173
Are you a cop?

174
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,840
Are you a cop?

175
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,013
Something happening down there?

176
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,217
No, nothing's
happening down there.

177
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:36,646
Why are you filming nothing?

178
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,168
Look, first of
all, this isn't film.

179
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,523
It's videotape, all right?

180
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,964
Second of all, I'm an artist,
I don't have to explain to you

181
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,774
or anybody else in the
world what I'm doing.

182
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,115
Huh, art.

183
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,151
But there's nothing
happening down there.

184
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,579
You'd be surprised what you
can do in the editing process.

185
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:54,916
Bam.

186
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,666
What's your video about?

187
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,791
It's a goddamn
documentary, all right?

188
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:02,747
About the murders?

189
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:05,802
Yeah.

190
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,044
About the murders.

191
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,755
I mean, why else
would I be here,

192
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,931
at this hour, freezing
my ass off, huh?

193
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,872
And listen, don't try and
rip me off, all right?

194
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:15,914
That happened to me once before,

195
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,145
and I didn't take kindly
to it, you understand?

196
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:21,600
First they steal your
ideas, then your creativity,

197
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,434
and then goes your bank book.

198
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,190
And I tell you wha...

199
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:29,117
Jesus.

200
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,497
Now, was that strange
or was that strange?

201
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:41,838
Oh, man.

202
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:47,636
I don't know.

203
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,132
Jesus Christ.

204
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,390
Get a hold of yourself, man.

205
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,638
Just get a hold of yourself.

206
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,231
Hey, watch out!

207
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:49,573
Geez!

208
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,031
Van!

209
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,608
Not tonight.

210
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,824
Van, honey, you're
almost an hour late.

211
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,248
Let's go, inside.

212
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:03,247
Now suddenly he's
in a big hurry.

213
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,108
Maybe we
should think about this?

214
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,132
What're you, crazy?

215
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,040
I told you this was easy money.

216
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,654
Besides, we'll go
to drac's after.

217
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,384
We'll have a really good time.

218
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:15,464
No, forget it, um, I'm leaving!

219
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,344
Just tell Van I lost
my nerves, okay?

220
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:20,051
Oh, come on, don't be
a chickenshit, please!

221
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,276
I am chickenshit
and I'll wait for you

222
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,397
at drac's tonight, okay?

223
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:27,851
Bye, baby!

224
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:53,051
J right from the beginning

225
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,673
j clouds begin to pour

226
00:16:56,015 --> 00:17:00,759
j but we were all too young to
fear the power of the storm

227
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,432
j if we had lost our
hopes we knew our

228
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,560
j dreams would still remain

229
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:09,984
j because nothing is impossible

230
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:15,065
j nothing burns like
fire in the rain

231
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:22,618
j fire in the rain

232
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,664
j thunder rocked the mountains

233
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,496
j lightning cracked the sky

234
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:35,585
j no one that survived this
hurricane would dare deny

235
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,137
j if fate had played it's part

236
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,511
j there would be
nothing to explain

237
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,810
j what was once a
very tiny spark

238
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:49,891
j is now a blazing
fire in the rain

239
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:57,445
j fire in the rain

240
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,656
j rain

241
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,651
J now see the sun coming out

242
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,574
j from behind the darkest clouds

243
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,527
j say goodbye to the storm

244
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,455
j as it moves across the sky

245
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:51,582
j see the fire burning brighter
than it ever has before

246
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,873
j moving close, touch the flame

247
00:18:55,217 --> 00:19:00,007
j burn like fire in the rain

248
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:06,639
j fire in the rain

249
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:12,645
j fire in the rain

250
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,527
j fire in the rain

251
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,909
J I've heard that
voice before somehow

252
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:14,585
j can't imagine

253
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:19,712
j it speaks words without
knowing what they mean

254
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:24,469
j and I've seen that
face before somewhere

255
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:26,422
j can't remember

256
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:31,511
j it seems as if it
happened in a dream

257
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,972
j I laugh and now you know

258
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,774
j that some things never change

259
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:42,196
j I laugh again because
to me you seem

260
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:47,277
j so strange

261
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:55,160
j so strange

262
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,703
j so strange

263
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:01,581
Michael?

264
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,163
I took a chance
you might still be awake.

265
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,508
Come onin.

266
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,049
I do my best work at night.

267
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,222
Do you want a glass of wine?

268
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,050
No, thank you.

269
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:19,683
Your last letter said you were
arranging a list of suspects.

270
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,607
I have friends in high places.

271
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,730
Well, a couple anyway.

272
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:30,356
There's over 2,000
names on that list.

273
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:39,792
Amazing.

274
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:43,911
What a city.

275
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,588
Only the first

276
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,633
they have records of kinkiness.

277
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,460
L.A. you know.

278
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:52,885
Any conclusions?

279
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,885
None that you'd
be interested in.

280
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,636
Try me.

281
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,144
Not one of them is a vampire.

282
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:03,688
You're right.

283
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,357
That doesn't interest me.

284
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,773
But you're the believer.

285
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,154
What makes you so sure?

286
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:14,655
None of them have
been seen in daylight.

287
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:17,872
Oh, yes.

288
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,039
The lore.

289
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,789
Can't be seen in mirrors,
afraid of garlic.

290
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,120
All those sorts of things.

291
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:35,463
Is that a smile?

292
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,848
You're really obsessed
with this vampire business.

293
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,903
Put my personal beliefs
aside for a second,

294
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:42,428
I also happen to be a
damn good investigator.

295
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:45,560
And rule one is, you work from
a theory that fits the facts.

296
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:49,268
Now, the facts are, we've
got a killer running around,

297
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:52,355
who drains his victim of blood.

298
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,691
Now, what are the possibilities?

299
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,115
Who drinks blood?

300
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,993
Nobody said the
killer drinks the blood.

301
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,744
Puncture wounds?

302
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:07,628
- Just kinkiness.
- No.

303
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:10,707
Rule two is you don't alter
the facts to fit the theory.

304
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,587
The facts say vampire.

305
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:19,806
Look, the victims' bodies
are still at the morgue, right?

306
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:21,975
As far as I know.

307
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,677
Well, doesn't legend say

308
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:26,514
that the vampire's
victim becomes a vampire?

309
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:27,939
That depends.

310
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:32,896
Look, the dead are dead, no
matter how they got that way.

311
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:36,607
Dead and that's all.

312
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,850
Do you know that some
people believe that the spirit

313
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:44,206
hangs around for a while?

314
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,645
That if you can get
in touch with them,

315
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,534
they can tell you things?

316
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:49,941
I suppose
you're one of the people

317
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,705
who believes that?

318
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:54,258
Actually, I am trying
to get in touch with them.

319
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:56,715
Maybe one of the murder
victims can tell me something.

320
00:25:57,014 --> 00:26:00,598
I need someone to
investigate the living.

321
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,799
Let's stick to reality.

322
00:26:03,145 --> 00:26:06,262
There are all kinds of reality.

323
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:09,481
Good luck.

324
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,418
Let me know when the
spirits talk to you.

325
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:15,438
You're funny, huh?

326
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:18,845
I didn't mean to
make fun of you,

327
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:21,360
but you must admit
it's a little bizarre.

328
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:26,495
That's okay, it was worth it
just to see you smile again.

329
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,583
I should go.

330
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,252
Really? So soon?

331
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,692
Why don't you stay and watch
some of this movie with me?

332
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,047
More vampires?

333
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,384
No, thank you.

334
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,384
When will I see you again?

335
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,303
I'll call you in a day or two.

336
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:44,769
Jet lag.

337
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:50,644
Tell me something.

338
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:56,111
What're you gonna do with
your vampire, if you find him?

339
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,565
I don't know.

340
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,580
Goodnight.

341
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,375
Lori.

342
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:10,403
Up and at 'em, morning glory.

343
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,118
Look, I brought
you some groceries.

344
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,306
Oh, listen, I'm sorry
that we didn't make it

345
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,752
to drac's last night.

346
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:25,706
You know Van, one thing
led to another and,

347
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,837
well, we never made
it out of the house.

348
00:31:28,178 --> 00:31:30,339
Jenny, it's almost 8:30.

349
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,511
Don't you have to be at work?

350
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:33,849
Jenny?

351
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,309
Jenny.

352
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,315
Jenny?

353
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:46,568
Jenny?

354
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:47,905
Jenny, Jenny!

355
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,657
Oh, god, you scared me.

356
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:58,727
Well, listen, I
brought some groceries.

357
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,120
Breakfast in 15 minutes?

358
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:07,547
The thing about him is his eyes.

359
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,092
The way they look at you.

360
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,886
It's kind of hypnotic, you know?

361
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:15,555
Oh, brother, are you gone.

362
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,007
Michael fury, huh?

363
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,555
That's a nice name.

364
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:24,348
So, when are you gonna
see Mr. fury again?

365
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:25,693
Um...

366
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,606
Tonight at drac's.

367
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,021
No, you're not.

368
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:34,654
You promised me that you'd
do the video with me and Van!

369
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,569
No more, cherry.

370
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:41,657
But he's a famous
artist and I promised him!

371
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,538
He's using us.

372
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:47,667
He just got some kind
of big Grant, he's rich!

373
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:50,423
He's weird.

374
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:01,726
Will you at least come
along and keep me company?

375
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,063
Please?

376
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,566
You've won $1,000!

377
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:11,441
- Oh, my god!
- You've won $1,000!

378
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,271
No way.

379
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,735
The station that
just loves to give you money!

380
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,321
And now for all you people
sitting in that big gridlock

381
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,248
called the 405,
here's Jay Willis!

382
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,482
The number two Lane
closed for a couple minutes on

383
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:32,296
transition, harbor northbound
to the Santa Monica westbound.

384
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:34,053
Oh, that's good.

385
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,086
Very good, yes, I like that.

386
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,388
Huh, open up, open up.

387
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:40,726
Yes.

388
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:45,728
That's nice.

389
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,685
Wet your lips, you
make me, I'll tell ya.

390
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,491
What's this thing here?

391
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,944
That's a vampire hunting
sword, 16th century.

392
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,654
Just put it down, put it down.

393
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,535
Thank you, step away.

394
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:05,876
Very good.

395
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:09,832
Right there, right there, yes.

396
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,131
On, the lick, yes, lick it.

397
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,468
Beautiful.

398
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,584
Just move around, scoot around.

399
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,545
That's good, yes, yes.

400
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,221
"Woman found dead.

401
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,308
"Blood drained."

402
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,936
Oh, here's one about
the third victim.

403
00:34:27,274 --> 00:34:29,060
Metropolis, two nights ago.

404
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,608
Oh, gorgeous.

405
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:32,945
Yes, that's good.

406
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,751
Do you think maybe
it's really a vampire?

407
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,237
Vampires.

408
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,691
Right.

409
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,304
Well, you know,
Van's great-great

410
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:41,613
grandmother was
a vampire hunter.

411
00:34:41,955 --> 00:34:43,946
Get out, there's no such thing.

412
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,657
Jenny, babe, try not
to comment on things

413
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:48,563
you know absolutely
nothing about, all right?

414
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:49,587
Come here.

415
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:51,662
Let me have the chicken.

416
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:52,587
You've had enough
to eat, all right?

417
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,334
You're always eatin', sit down.

418
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,671
Okay, now look at
me, look at me.

419
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:02,725
My god, girls.

420
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,559
Do you see the, listen to me.

421
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,496
Look at me, look at
me, look at me, good.

422
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,689
Jenny, just take your finger.

423
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,517
Look at me.

424
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,444
Thank you, take your finger
and just, very lightly,

425
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,772
with your fingernail,
touch the egg.

426
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:22,075
The egg. - The egg's over here.

427
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:23,412
Come on.

428
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:24,849
Good, now just hold
it right there.

429
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,204
Hold on, hold on.

430
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:30,492
- That's tickles.
- Don't move, don't move.

431
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:31,939
- Your hands are freezing.
- Just touch it.

432
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,149
- My hands are greasy.
- For Christ sakes.

433
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:34,538
Just touch the egg!

434
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:36,794
Take your index finger.

435
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,966
Gently...

436
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,553
Oh, this could get weird.

437
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:45,678
Take your index finger,
not on foot, on the egg.

438
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,469
Very good, right there,
now just hold it.

439
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,879
Oh, that's good, don't wipe
it off, don't wipe it off.

440
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:57,144
Don't wipe it, oh no,
back off, back off!

441
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,249
Hold it right there.

442
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,324
Hold that, hold that, hold
your leg, hold your leg!

443
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,536
God, yes, absolute master.

444
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:09,410
The curves.

445
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:12,618
The texture, shadows,
texture shadows.

446
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,998
Tantalizing ambiguities.

447
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,750
This is fantastic.

448
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:43,615
A little love in
the fast Lane from bill cool.

449
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:45,632
The afternoon commute home, Tom?

450
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,781
Pauline, southbound
55 there's an accident

451
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:49,363
in the number two Lane.

452
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,914
Hot new group, durango 95!

453
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,977
The darkness is his domain.

454
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:20,355
To be seen yet unseen
is no difficult task,

455
00:37:20,697 --> 00:37:22,483
for one such as he.

456
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,898
The shadow you thought
you did not see

457
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:29,657
flitting against the walls
of your darkened bedroom.

458
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:30,998
It was there.

459
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,290
The sound you could almost hear!

460
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,618
His voice in another form!

461
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,545
Yes.

462
00:37:39,883 --> 00:37:41,748
The hiss of distant snakes.

463
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:50,049
Though his power over beasts
is great, it is not limitless.

464
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:51,842
No, sadly, no.

465
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,933
Certain animals do not obey him.

466
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,687
Indeed, would hurt
him, if they could!

467
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:01,234
Small dogs.

468
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:05,530
Especially pekingese,
dachshunds, cocker spaniels!

469
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:09,318
They are more to my liking.

470
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,828
The blood is the life.

471
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:16,742
In truth, his blood
is pale as water.

472
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:19,463
Pale blood.

473
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:55,739
Pale blood.

474
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,332
Hey, Lori.

475
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:39,918
Are you okay?

476
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,086
Yeah.

477
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,173
Let's go sit down.

478
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,718
Though his powers are
greater than his limitations,

479
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,591
the night only is his,

480
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,718
yet how completely he
dominates the darkness.

481
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:03,223
He can become shadow itself
and flow through windows,

482
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,355
like water through cloth!

483
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:10,856
To be heard, yet unheard.

484
00:40:12,285 --> 00:40:14,697
His voice in another form.

485
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,494
Yes, the hiss of... - Hi, Jenny.

486
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,117
- Hi.
- Distant snakes!

487
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:21,040
The blood is the life.

488
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,084
I was afraid you wouldn't come.

489
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,497
I'm here.

490
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:31,505
We spent this
wonderful night together.

491
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,462
There are so many things
I want to know about you.

492
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:35,967
Jenny.

493
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:38,846
Michael, I think I'm
falling in love with...

494
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,187
Jenny.

495
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,152
Listen to me.

496
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,354
You don't know me.

497
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,825
You don't who I
am, or what I am.

498
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:00,530
I can't let myself love.

499
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:03,835
Anyone.

500
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:05,837
So, please.

501
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,251
No more questions.

502
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,100
Jenny.

503
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:23,647
So?

504
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,683
So what?

505
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:28,641
Are you going to give me
your telephone number or not?

506
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:31,298
Barkeep, double scotch, rocks,.

507
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,062
Van, Van, there's Jenny.

508
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:35,569
- Where?
- Sittin' right over there.

509
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:36,990
Jenny, Jenny.

510
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,994
Just the girl I wanna see.

511
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:45,453
Hi, Jenny. - Hi, Jenny.

512
00:41:45,795 --> 00:41:48,332
Hi, have you met Michael fury?

513
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,426
How is the video going?

514
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,094
It's goin'.

515
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:58,992
So listen, do you
mind if we join you?

516
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,389
No, look, we gotta go.

517
00:42:00,727 --> 00:42:02,047
Wait a minute, we just got here.

518
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:03,664
You wanna stay here, you
stay, I got work to do.

519
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:04,723
Van!

520
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,604
Damn it, every
time I turn around.

521
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:09,975
Who was that?

522
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,234
I told you he was weird.

523
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:14,779
Listen, I don't wanna
hear it right now, okay?

524
00:42:15,116 --> 00:42:16,116
I've gotta go.

525
00:42:16,451 --> 00:42:17,651
Hey, but what about tonight?

526
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,792
I mean, we're supposed to...
Maybe later, huh?

527
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:23,196
Would you like a drink?

528
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,032
No, I'll get it myself, thanks.

529
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,255
Tell me about him.

530
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:38,597
Van?

531
00:42:39,766 --> 00:42:41,686
He's an artist, I've been
doing a video with him.

532
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:42,976
Really?

533
00:42:44,187 --> 00:42:46,553
I'd like to see it.

534
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,731
Oh, god, no, you wouldn't
wanna see any of that stuff.

535
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,068
Why not?

536
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,481
It's an erotic video.

537
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:59,319
I wouldn't want you to
think of me that way.

538
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:03,031
I don't.

539
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,578
Where is it?

540
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,578
I know what I saw, I
know it's here somewhere.

541
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:10,501
Come on, Van, it's
the big time now.

542
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:11,838
There.

543
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:13,879
There it is, right there.

Back it up.

567
00:44:28,583 --> 00:44:29,583

Nobody.

571
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:52,679
Oh, Jesus, Van, you
got yourself a vampire.

572
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:03,706
Damn it, this is the kind
of thing that happens

573
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:06,742
when your dreams
come true, this...

574
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:12,206
Sure, fight him with
a piece of wood.

575
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:13,543
Stupid.

576
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:19,873
You know what he's
doing, he's using Jenny.

577
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:21,958
He's using her to watch over me.

578
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,338
Son of a bitch.

579
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:24,486
You just don't understand.

580
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:28,608
You're a beautiful
girl, full of energy.

581
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:30,780
So beautiful.

582
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,787
You're so young.

583
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:40,002
You have so much life
to look forward to.

584
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:46,884
Do you really wanna
see Van's tapes?

585
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,181
I can get some of them for
you, do you want me to?

586
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,223
No.

587
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:52,674
I can handle it myself.

588
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:56,727
I would do anything for you.

589
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,895
You know that, don't you?

590
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:08,651
I know.

591
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,570
How did you get in here?

592
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,239
I, uh, I rented this
condo for you, remember?

593
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:15,692
I got the keys.

594
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:22,080
What's in the suitcase?

595
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,968
I'm not paying your
agency to investigate me.

596
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:48,265
Shouldn't you be
looking for a murderer?

597
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:56,236
I am looking for a murderer.

598
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,366
Meaning what?

599
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:07,795
I'm a suspect?

600
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:11,247
Everyone's a suspect.

601
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:16,343
Spoken like a master detective.

602
00:50:18,057 --> 00:50:20,469
I don't think this is funny.

603
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:25,728
I did a computer search on you.

604
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:27,225
You don't exist.

605
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:37,982
Computers makes mistakes.

606
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:41,694
If I were the killer,
why would I hire you?

607
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,700
Maybe you want someone to

608
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:46,703
uncover evidence
you left behind.

609
00:50:49,505 --> 00:50:51,666
No, my letters came from Europe.

610
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:53,622
That could be arranged.

611
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:09,055
You're actually serious.

612
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,496
You're not a killer.

613
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:28,620
Then what are you searching for?

614
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,671
I was hoping you
were the real thing.

615
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:36,545
"The real thing?"

616
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,750
You know what I mean.

617
00:51:41,974 --> 00:51:43,510
What luck.

618
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:45,136
I come all this way,

619
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:50,145
and all I get are
hallucinations.

620
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:52,734
Crazy people.

621
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:54,228
What hallucinations?

622
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,446
Nevermind.

623
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:00,898
Forget it.

624
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,679
Please, Michael, I need to
know, what are you seeing?

625
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:04,383
What I'm seeing is
none of your business.

626
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:07,613
No, it is, you see I'm
causing what you're seeing!

627
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:10,335
No.

628
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,356
No, you don't have that
kind of power, you can't.

629
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,380
How do you know?

630
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:16,213
Because it's just not possible.

631
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,461
It is possible.

632
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,633
I've been working for
those visions, you see?

633
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:23,758
Only, they've been
coming to you!

634
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:28,763
If that's true, what you're
doing is extremely dangerous.

635
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:30,832
You're playing with things
you know nothing about.

636
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:31,856
Leave the dead alone!

637
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,347
Michael, please.

638
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:38,482
I need to know
what you're seeing.

639
00:52:39,907 --> 00:52:41,613
Blood, I'm seeing blood.

640
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:46,360
Sometimes I think I'm going mad.

641
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:52,377
Satisfied?

642
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:07,764
You're not mad, Michael.

643
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,759
I don't know what you are,

644
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:13,937
but you're not mad.

645
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:15,605
I'm far from home.

646
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,810
Far from home.

647
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:22,814
And I'm tired.

648
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:26,609
I need to rest.

649
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:11,914
No.

650
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:31,976
No!

651
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,375
No!

652
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:02,423
Stop!

653
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,380
Michael?

654
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,800
Michael?

655
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:13,763
Michael.

656
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:41,859
Right now for
you early risers, it's music...

657
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,145
In Los Angeles,
the weather for the southland

658
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:46,535
is more of the same, low
clouds here this morning,

659
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,337
hot and smoggy but
sunny this afternoon.

660
00:57:49,675 --> 00:57:53,088
Highs generally in the mid-80s
in the downtown area...

661
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:55,031
It's going to
be busy on the Santa Monica

662
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:57,512
freeway east and westbound,
a lot of heavy traffic

663
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:00,431
this morning on the
Santa Monica freeway.

664
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:02,129
Had an earlier
accident, eastbound,

665
00:58:02,354 --> 00:58:04,094
before the harbor
area in the fast Lane.

666
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:06,976
That has been cleared,
southbound on the 405.

667
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,228
J love is just a fable

668
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:13,903
oh, Michael.
J and a wrung out fantasy

669
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:17,615
j you made me able

670
00:58:17,953 --> 00:58:21,662
j to look deeper right into me

671
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:26,329
j I know the consequence

672
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:33,590
And potentially
lethal shellfish from

673
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:36,919
Washington state, the
scallops contain vasotoxin.

674
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:39,880
That's a naturally-occurring
poison that can cause...

675
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,945
And Cincinnati, five-nothing.

676
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:44,013
Chicago four, Philadelphia one.

677
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,936
Montreal took Pittsburgh
five-four in 11 innings,

678
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:49,856
and the mets ended their
seven game losing streak.

679
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:32,651
Van?

680
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,151
Is anybody home?

681
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:08,309
Hi, um, um...

682
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:11,646
How you doin"?

683
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:14,223
I was, oh god, you scared
me, I was looking for cherry.

684
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:15,646
Ah.

685
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:17,882
It's amazing, you know, I
was just thinking about you.

686
01:00:17,906 --> 01:00:20,613
It's like you're
reading my mind.

687
01:00:20,951 --> 01:00:23,738
Anyhow, cherry won't be
back for a little while.

688
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,865
- I really gotta go now.
- No, you know what?

689
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:27,662
I have something
I wanna show ya.

690
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:29,159
No, I really gotta go, Van.

691
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:31,708
No, look, it won't take
long at all, it's beautiful.

692
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:33,125
Very special.

693
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:34,953
So, how you doin'? - Fine.

694
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:36,298
- Are you well?
- Uh-huh.

695
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,248
- You look so pretty today.
- Thank you.

696
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:41,335
Will this take long?
Jenny, you could be a star.

697
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:43,090
With such pretty eyes.

698
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:45,547
I want you to trust me.

699
01:00:45,892 --> 01:00:46,892
Come on.

700
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:54,108
Go on.

701
01:00:56,945 --> 01:00:59,652
What's that awful smell?

702
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:01,657
Garlic.

703
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:06,868
I painted 60 gallons of
garlic juice on all the walls.

704
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:09,742
Well, I mean almost all of 'em.

705
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:13,951
Vampires?

706
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:18,087
Are you trying to
keep vampires out?

707
01:01:18,425 --> 01:01:19,425
No.

708
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:26,630
I'm trying to keep a
vampire from getting out.

709
01:01:26,975 --> 01:01:27,975
Oh.

710
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:30,683
So, where is the vampire?

711
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:39,935
Hey, don't look at me. - No?

712
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,692
I came here in bright sunshine.

713
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:44,909
And garlic,

714
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:48,326
and crosses,

715
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:49,778
don't do a thing to me.

716
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:51,158
Nothin', huh?

717
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:55,830
Well, you see, the
vampire's not here yet.

718
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,580
- "Yet?"
- Yet.

719
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:06,636
But don't worry.

720
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:08,557
He's comin'.

721
01:02:10,185 --> 01:02:12,096
Gonna be here real soon.

722
01:02:14,773 --> 01:02:16,453
Look, Van, that's
real interesting, but...

723
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:19,057
Oh, do you what's interesting?

724
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,734
Look right up
there, right there.

725
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:24,814
And over there, and
right behind ya.

726
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,992
I don't see anything.

727
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:31,661
Well look, right there,
it's a hidden video camera.

728
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:34,489
You see, first of all, I'm
gonna capture the vampire,

729
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:36,114
then I'm gonna tape him feeding,

730
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:38,613
and then I'm gonna become the
most famous artist in America.

731
01:02:38,922 --> 01:02:41,504
I mean, it's one,
it's two, it's three.

732
01:02:42,801 --> 01:02:43,903
That's a very clever idea, Van.

733
01:02:43,927 --> 01:02:45,007
I know, very clever, huh?

734
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:47,674
- But I really...
- No, no, Jenny, Jenny.

735
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,172
You're so cold, so cold.

736
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:55,973
What's the matter, you think
I'm gonna steal your purse, hm?

737
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:57,314
Hey.

738
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:01,604
Are you feeling guilty, hm?

739
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:04,186
- Guilty about what?
- "Guilty about what?"

740
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:06,532
About this.

741
01:03:06,825 --> 01:03:10,238
About swiping my tapes
for your boyfriend.

742
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,119
You think I'm stupid?

743
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:15,457
You think I'm dumb?

744
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:17,578
You think I'm retarded?

745
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:18,980
Don't you think I know what you

746
01:03:19,004 --> 01:03:20,744
and that blood sucker are up to?

747
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:22,358
What're you talking about?

748
01:03:22,382 --> 01:03:23,609
Michael fury, that's
what I'm talking about.

749
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,169
That blood sucker.

750
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:26,904
- Are you crazy or what?
- Oh, yeah?

751
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:29,886
I'm crazy, I'm fucking crazy!

752
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:31,633
I'm crazy like a fox.

753
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,517
I had a plan all laid
out, where these murders

754
01:03:35,854 --> 01:03:38,095
were gonna look like
the work of a vampire.

755
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:39,720
- Did you kill those?
- Oh, yeah.

756
01:03:39,983 --> 01:03:43,521
Yeah, I killed them and
believe me, it wasn't easy.

757
01:03:43,862 --> 01:03:46,353
'Cause those things don't
come that good to me.

758
01:03:46,698 --> 01:03:48,689
'Cause you see, vampires,
they're so lonely,

759
01:03:49,034 --> 01:03:50,740
and they keep searching
and searching,

760
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:53,409
and searching for
their own kind.

761
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:54,747
You're crazy!

762
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:55,914
I'm crazy.

763
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:59,537
Your boyfriend fell
right into the trap.

764
01:03:59,878 --> 01:04:00,878
You're cra zy!

765
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:03,130
I'm crazy.

766
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,419
The Mark of the beast.

767
01:04:11,765 --> 01:04:13,005
I'm c razy?

768
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:15,719
Look at me.

769
01:04:16,061 --> 01:04:17,471
Look at Mel

770
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,849
I'm right, I'm fuckin' right!

771
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:23,602
I'm crazy.

772
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:24,943
I'm right!

773
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:53,320
No, no, no, no, don't
fret, don't fret.

774
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:54,616
How you doin'?

775
01:05:57,871 --> 01:05:59,702
Look what I got for ya.

776
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:04,123
You know what this is?

777
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:07,373
This is the upper jaw of a
Mexican vampire bat, huh?

778
01:06:07,714 --> 01:06:09,545
Fitting, isn't it?

779
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:10,963
Please, Van.

780
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:13,007
Now, don't you
worry, don't you worry.

781
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:16,006
This isn't gonna hurt
you one little bit.

782
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:25,553
Oh-ho, Jesus!

783
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:26,899
Oh, we got gusher.

784
01:06:27,192 --> 01:06:28,192
Oh, Christ.

785
01:06:31,613 --> 01:06:32,272
Okay, you're fine.

786
01:06:32,614 --> 01:06:34,696
Hold that, hold that, good.

787
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:37,986
Just like Texas, you see.

788
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:40,694
The jugular's the
one you want to hit.

789
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,683
Of course, your boyfriend
was a little kinky.

790
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:44,789
He wasn't all that efficient.

791
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:47,742
God.

792
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,160
It's ironic, isn't it?

793
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:29,822
I mean, I actually know how to
do this better than he does.

794
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:31,494
Funny.

795
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:32,839
No?

796
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,836
Okay, well we're gonna get
you lookin' real pretty.

797
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:37,462
Fix that little bow of yours,

798
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:39,795
straighten this out for
your boyfriend, okay, huh?

799
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:41,504
Here, hold still, hold still.

800
01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:42,884
Very good, mm-hm.

801
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:46,830
Of course, you're not gonna
be much use to him all empty,

802
01:07:46,854 --> 01:07:49,596
so, uh, I think there's
gonna be just enough left

803
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:53,229
to whet his appetite, for
the meal to come.

804
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:17,336
Just a little bit more,
we're almost done, all right?

805
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:36,088
Oh, Jenny.

806
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:23,590
Sorry about that.

807
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:32,929
What?

808
01:10:33,271 --> 01:10:35,387
Oh, no, no, this is wine.

809
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:38,769
I take the blood out, I
certainly don't drink it.

810
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:40,691
Here's to you, brother.

811
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:46,818
I'm not your brother.

812
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:49,589
Well, we are a little
touchy this evening,

813
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:51,160
aren't we, Mr. fury?

814
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:55,827
Why did you kill her?

815
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:58,830
It wasn't necessary.

816
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:00,932
Look, you might wanna
do things half-assed,

817
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:02,818
but if somebody's gonna
do somethin' right,

818
01:11:02,842 --> 01:11:04,958
they should do it right.

819
01:11:05,303 --> 01:11:06,588
You killed them all.

820
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:07,929
Of course I did.

821
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:09,800
And I've got videotape
of it, it's brilliant.

822
01:11:10,141 --> 01:11:12,257
I drained each one
of them bloodless.

823
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:14,638
Just like you'd have done it.

824
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,682
I haven't killed
in a very long time.

825
01:11:21,903 --> 01:11:23,564
Well, that's a goddamn shame.

826
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:26,317
I mean, it's
therapeutic as hell.

827
01:11:27,325 --> 01:11:28,325
God.

828
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:30,741
You must be so lonely.

829
01:11:31,746 --> 01:11:32,746
So lonely.

830
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:37,206
There are not many of
you left, are there?

831
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:39,784
You're right, there
are few of us left.

832
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:42,708
Now all I find are perverts.

833
01:11:43,049 --> 01:11:44,255
Perverts?

834
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:46,207
And madmen, like you.

835
01:11:47,887 --> 01:11:48,887
"Madmen."

836
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:58,602
You shouldn't have killed her.

837
01:12:28,427 --> 01:12:33,296
J think of things that made
you cry when you were young

838
01:12:36,561 --> 01:12:41,476
j realize at last your
life has just begun

839
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:49,233
j think of lonely
places far away

840
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:56,532
j I'm sorry but I don't
know what to say

841
01:12:56,873 --> 01:12:57,873
yeah, yeah.

842
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,457
He's the real
McCoy and you, Van,

843
01:13:01,794 --> 01:13:04,752
you, my man, are the
one who caught him.

844
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,507
Oh, my god, no.

845
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:14,178
Sweet Jesus!

846
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:15,595
Easy now.

847
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:16,933
God, he is real.

848
01:13:55,014 --> 01:13:59,758
J close your eyes,
remember me from long ago

849
01:14:02,772 --> 01:14:07,687
j never say a word, no
one will ever know

850
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:14,735
j I'll think of life
the way it was before

851
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:22,785
j imagine what the future
has in store for you

852
01:14:24,919 --> 01:14:29,834
j I'll take the time
to waste 1,000 years

853
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:37,879
j touch the face,
wipe away the tears

854
01:14:40,393 --> 01:14:45,308
j speak the truth, break
the heart that bleeds

855
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:52,360
j stab the back, bite
the hand that feeds

856
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:41,252
Oh, shit.

857
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:42,597
Damn it.

858
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:49,515
Oh, come on, Van,
maintain your vigil.

859
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:54,098
You know, who knows, man, don't
know what that beast'll do.

860
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:03,550
No, Lori.

861
01:18:03,888 --> 01:18:05,253
No.

862
01:18:05,598 --> 01:18:06,212
No, Lori.

863
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:07,557
No!

864
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:45,887
Cherry?

865
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:47,889
About time.

866
01:18:49,683 --> 01:18:51,594
Dinner.

867
01:18:52,811 --> 01:18:53,971
Cherry?

868
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:55,849
J cherry

869
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:58,397
j cherry pie

870
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:00,190
j oh

871
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:05,365
cherry?

872
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:09,410
Cherry!

873
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:11,746
Voodoo Van?

874
01:19:12,665 --> 01:19:13,665
Jesus.

875
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:16,119
Who the hell are you,
what're you doing here?

876
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:17,825
I'm here to see Jenny.

877
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:19,626
You're a friend of Jenny's?

878
01:19:19,964 --> 01:19:20,623
Sort of.

879
01:19:20,965 --> 01:19:22,484
Well, that's very
coincidental, isn't it?

880
01:19:22,508 --> 01:19:25,500
I'm just waiting for
another friend of Jenny's.

881
01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:26,844
I know you, don't I?

882
01:19:27,054 --> 01:19:28,254
Yeah, I've seen you someplace.

883
01:19:28,389 --> 01:19:30,596
You're a friend of
cherry's, right?

884
01:19:30,933 --> 01:19:32,298
- No.
- No?

885
01:19:32,643 --> 01:19:34,429
I'm sorry, what's your name?
Lori.

886
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:36,306
Lori, I'm Van.

887
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:39,480
My god, you'd be perfect.

888
01:19:39,817 --> 01:19:40,817
For what?

889
01:19:42,361 --> 01:19:45,569
You're not gonna
believe this, but uh,

890
01:19:45,906 --> 01:19:49,069
I'm doing a film and cherry
was supposed to play the role,

891
01:19:49,410 --> 01:19:50,410
but she didn't show up.

892
01:19:50,661 --> 01:19:52,138
You're absolutely
perfect for the part.

893
01:19:52,162 --> 01:19:53,162
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

894
01:19:53,372 --> 01:19:54,372
What part?

895
01:19:54,665 --> 01:19:55,945
Well, it's the star of the fim.

896
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:58,036
Hasn't Jenny told
you about this?

897
01:19:58,377 --> 01:20:00,146
- Oh, yeah, I think she did.
- You know who I am, right?

898
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:01,410
And you know what I do, right?

899
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:03,416
- Video artist, right?
- Right, right.

900
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:06,669
Well, Lori, let me tell
you, whoever plays that role

901
01:20:07,011 --> 01:20:08,501
is gonna end up very famous.

902
01:20:08,846 --> 01:20:10,131
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

903
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:11,472
Famous?

904
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:12,797
Oh, yeah, famous.

905
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:15,723
Can I see Jenny now?

906
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:17,770
Yeah.

907
01:20:24,862 --> 01:20:27,478
So I bet you're wondering what
this film is about, right?

908
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:28,842
- Oh, yeah.
- But you know what?

909
01:20:28,866 --> 01:20:30,302
I don't know about
you but I'm so sick

910
01:20:30,326 --> 01:20:32,692
of the male-dominated
superiority in this business.

911
01:20:33,037 --> 01:20:34,556
The only thing that's
respected about a woman

912
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:35,660
is the size of her breasts,

913
01:20:35,998 --> 01:20:38,205
or the amount of blood that
you can throw all over her.

914
01:20:41,253 --> 01:20:43,585
Come on, really, where is Jenny?

915
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:46,254
"Where's Jenny."

916
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,877
Step right in, my dear.

917
01:20:48,218 --> 01:20:50,300
Welcome to fame and fortune.

918
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:09,030
No closer.

919
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:11,063
I knew it.

920
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:14,195
I knew it from the
moment I met you.

921
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:42,438
Don't.

922
01:21:44,108 --> 01:21:46,224
Don't look at me that way.

923
01:21:47,694 --> 01:21:51,687
I never really believed
this would happen for me.

924
01:21:55,119 --> 01:21:57,610
I wish we had never met.

925
01:21:57,955 --> 01:21:59,491
You don't mean that.

926
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:17,721
God look at her, she acts
like she has no will of her own.

927
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:29,474
Oh, yes, that's nice.

928
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:31,606
Vampire foreplay.

929
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:33,562
Go on, go on, bite her, bite.

930
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:36,523
No, damn it, you gotta bite her!

931
01:22:36,869 --> 01:22:37,869
Yeah, maybe now.

932
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,485
Maybe, come on, bite her.

933
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:42,993
Yes, yes, once in the
thrall of the beast,

934
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:47,121
you're a blood
slave, nothing more.

935
01:22:56,263 --> 01:22:58,925
But he hasn't even
bitten her yet.

936
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:09,352
Yeah, maybe now.

937
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:11,558
Maybe he'll bite her now.

938
01:23:32,883 --> 01:23:34,248
Oh, my god.

939
01:23:34,593 --> 01:23:36,129
She's one of 'em, too.

940
01:24:11,838 --> 01:24:13,749
I couldn't have hoped.

941
01:24:15,342 --> 01:24:16,673
Never go away.

942
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:41,948
You need blood.

943
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:50,418
Oh, my god.

944
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:52,753
Son of a bitch!

945
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:42,905
Jesus.

946
01:26:44,658 --> 01:26:46,774
What a fuckin' nightmare.

947
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:05,886
No!

948
01:27:06,847 --> 01:27:07,847
No!

949
01:27:14,187 --> 01:27:14,801
Sit down, gentlemen.

950
01:27:15,147 --> 01:27:16,762
Please, please sit down.

951
01:27:17,107 --> 01:27:19,598
What you are about to see
is one of the most dramatic

952
01:27:19,943 --> 01:27:24,061
pieces of video art that
has ever been created.

953
01:27:24,406 --> 01:27:27,318
Mr. oswald, will you
please hold still?

954
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:30,822
It is a work of true
conviction, of true commitment,

955
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:34,951
and years and years of
single-minded dedication.

956
01:27:36,543 --> 01:27:39,501
Now, you might ask,
"what is conviction?"

957
01:27:39,838 --> 01:27:41,954
Conviction is sacrifice.

958
01:27:42,299 --> 01:27:43,584
"What is commitment?"

959
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:46,166
Commitment is sacrifice!

960
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:47,511
"What is dedication?"

961
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:49,635
Dedication is sacrifice.

962
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:51,258
And finally, you might say...

963
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,342
Dr. lang to
orthopedics, west wing.

964
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:57,348
Dr. lang to
orthopedics, west wing.

965
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:00,691
And no one, gentlemen,

966
01:28:00,984 --> 01:28:03,646
no one understands
that better than me.

967
01:28:09,326 --> 01:28:12,739
There, that's your
key scene, Mr. oswald!

968
01:28:15,916 --> 01:28:17,372
Now, pay attention,

969
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:18,895
'cause they can screw with
these tapes magnetically.

970
01:28:18,919 --> 01:28:21,080
Oh, yeah, they can do that.

971
01:28:21,421 --> 01:28:22,501
Yeah, see, see?

972
01:28:22,839 --> 01:28:24,901
Bullet hits, right through the
chest, but it doesn't matter.

973
01:28:24,925 --> 01:28:28,668
You can shoot these son
of a bitches all day long.

974
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:30,673
What's the matter,
am I boring you?

975
01:28:31,014 --> 01:28:32,158
Well, how's this, huh,
look what they did to me.

976
01:28:32,182 --> 01:28:34,173
These are vampire bites!

977
01:28:35,852 --> 01:28:37,079
No, no, no, please
don't take 'em.

978
01:28:37,103 --> 01:28:39,344
I'm just gettin'
to the primo stuff.

979
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:40,875
This is where this guy, Michael,

980
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:43,891
actually turns
into a mutant bat!

981
01:28:44,236 --> 01:28:47,603
I mean, look at it, for
Christ sake, look at that!

982
01:28:47,948 --> 01:28:50,314
I actually had footage
of him changing,

983
01:28:50,659 --> 01:28:52,650
and then rising from the dead.

984
01:28:57,290 --> 01:28:59,781
Got footage of him
making love, Mr. oswald.

985
01:29:01,753 --> 01:29:04,085
X-rated love scenes, Mr. oswald.

986
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:12,302
I'm going to like it here.

987
01:29:36,538 --> 01:29:39,075
Look, I wasn't saying
nothing bad about you.

988
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:40,416
No.

989
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:44,751
I mean, we were just
watching the film, okay?

990
01:29:47,841 --> 01:29:49,360
It's kinda like we're
friends, you know?

991
01:29:49,384 --> 01:29:51,215
I mean, we've been
through things together.

992
01:29:51,553 --> 01:29:53,714
Sort of like friends, right?

993
01:29:55,015 --> 01:29:58,633
I mean, we were just
watching the film, it's...

994
01:29:58,977 --> 01:29:59,977
Okay?

995
01:30:10,697 --> 01:30:11,697
I'm just gonna...

996
01:30:23,376 --> 01:30:28,291
J close your eyes,
remember me from long ago

997
01:30:31,343 --> 01:30:36,212
j never say a word, no
one will ever know

998
01:30:38,558 --> 01:30:43,427
j I'll think of life
the way it was before

999
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:51,310
j imagine what the future
has in store for you

1000
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:58,317
j I'll take the time
to waste 1,000 years

1001
01:31:01,706 --> 01:31:06,621
j touch the face,
wipe away the tears

1002
01:31:09,005 --> 01:31:13,920
j speak the truth, break
the heart that bleeds

1003
01:31:16,221 --> 01:31:20,931
j stab the back, bite
the hand that feeds

1004
01:32:09,232 --> 01:32:12,690
J now see the sun coming out

1005
01:32:13,028 --> 01:32:15,565
j from behind the darkest clouds

1006
01:32:15,905 --> 01:32:18,442
j say goodbye to the storm

1007
01:32:18,783 --> 01:32:21,149
j as it moves across the sky

1008
01:32:21,494 --> 01:32:26,284
j see the fire burning brighter
than it ever has before

1009
01:32:27,584 --> 01:32:29,620
j moving close, touch the flame

1010
01:32:29,961 --> 01:32:34,751
j burn like fire in the rain

1011
01:32:36,634 --> 01:32:41,503
j fire in the rain

1012
01:32:42,432 --> 01:32:47,347
j fire in the rain

1013
01:32:48,354 --> 01:32:51,187
j fire in the rain
