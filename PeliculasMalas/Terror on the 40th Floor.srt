Folks. Folks. Folks. I know this isn't what you call

you remind me of a little girl on a
swing I love it it is so comfortable I

77
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:11,620
suppose that you have a boyfriend
waiting or or a party that you'd better

78
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,840
go to nothing urgent

79
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:27,790
glad you decided to stay I'm also
curious what about the flattery the

80
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:35,760
tender smiles I was it just a required
protocol for executive role or are you

81
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:42,900

interesting man

you know we can talk scrape with each
other ginger can't we come on we're both

83
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:59,220
on the same team sure that's why I know
I can ask a little favor in there you do

84
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:22,290
it for me sure if I could now look this
may sound crazy but you were the only

85
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,970
one in this whole company that I can ask
I am yeah

86
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:28,889
you're in charge of the personnel
records Roger I think that the

87
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:36,899
confidential phone wireless what did you
make sure where he doesn't look at those

88
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:46,949
files just one quick look little files
are locked sure I'm not supposed to let

89
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:55,889
anybody look at them my job ginger I
think you won't sit down the state I

90
00:13:55,889 --> 00:13:58,639
need that motion

91
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:17,360
Charlie Charlie

92
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:30,960
Charlie

93
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,940
we have a major crime progress on the
1200 lift hours building give me a third

94
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:23,150
law assignment three additional truck
companies and all available air bottles

95
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:27,980
I didn't want you have rescue problem
negative we had one fatality one man

96
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,620
injured the injured man has been
identified as a security guard he said

97
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:45,870
there's nobody else in the building

98
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:50,040
tell us the problems his men are having
with this fire chief maca can you tell

99
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,420
us please what's going on kula for one
thing the fire started 126 feet above

100
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,240
ground level and we don't have aerial
equipment I enough to reach that far

101
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,960
so everything we're fighting this fire
with has to be carried up on our backs I

102
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,370
see there's a surprising lack of flames
visible from the outside why is that

103
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:08,820
well that's because a tall building like
this is like a giant incinerator the

104
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:13,470
heat and smoke and flames go straight up
nobody literally becomes a chimney and

105
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:17,459
any inside opening like an elevator
shaft or a stairwell or air-conditioning

106
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:20,850
ducts just sucks the smoke they hate the
flames straight up and pushes of outward

107
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:24,360
we can't get above it so we have to
fight it from below so to chase it from

108
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,959
Florida floor where the fire has already
climbed seventh floor so far now is

109
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,320
there a possibility would go all the way
to the top yeah there's always that

110
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,870
possibility but we're certainly going to
do everything we can to keep that from

111
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:36,180
happening
well what steps here would you be excuse

112
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:47,430
me more vino anyone no no I'm gonna just
stay with it just happened have another

113
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:53,550
bottle all night yeah I would say I had
the last Epistle I read anywhere I said

114
00:17:53,550 --> 00:18:00,140

party anyway don't let her worry I mean

118
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,990

00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:33,450

do have one

128

every successful executive shoot

129
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:54,450
boys we have a lot of trouble hole in
this thing the fires extended at the

130
00:20:54,450 --> 00:21:06,060
utility shaft in the 17th floor to get
those hoses up in a hurry Italian

131
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:17,880
seventh Italian one I'm sending three
additional companies the air

132
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,310
conditioning is shoving heat the smoke
into the upper floors I'm gonna shut off

133
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,080
the power
we need those elevators chief the guys

134
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,810
will drag it from blowing stuff up a
stairwell I don't those flames carry any

135
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:27,720
higher right then let me cut the power
on the fire that'll shut off the air

136
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,480
conditioners and we'll still have part
of the rest of the building all right

137
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:37,530
try but those flames company higher up
the power to everything come on thank

00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:05,930
just thought that it would be easier to
talk relax come here

158
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:19,830
I am I had it all figured out the way I
was going to tell you I had one all

159
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:38,070
figured out your mind pregnant what you
can call me stupid or dumb or whatever

160
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:44,929
it's just a tire stay on the pill when I
should have are you sure you're pregnant

161
00:26:44,929 --> 00:26:59,299
sure that's great that is just great
what do we do now discuss it I mean I

162
00:26:59,299 --> 00:27:10,499
can think of a couple a couple of
possibilities right off like what well

163
00:27:10,499 --> 00:27:22,100
um abortion isn't a lot easier now we
could just

164
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:29,200
get married he didn't have the baby
about Kat damn Paul what about them

165
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:38,560
they're part of you aren't they I mean
well it is kind of a package deal

166
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:44,360
sure I just tell him their daddy made a
slight bedroom mistake and had to get

167
00:27:44,360 --> 00:28:03,160
married that what it is Jim
a mistake I got to think about it

168
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:31,509
so like insanely

169
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:03,640
I qualified find them questionable
choice for this position but like a 12

170
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,300
years with this company is your foster
does he know what I can do

171
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:11,290
it's trying to wipe me out twelve years
like that what the letter back and let's

172
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:17,770
get out of here Rita what you having
ginger I don't want them to see him go

173
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:27,280
back around the other way don't meet in
the office put it back you gonna leave

174
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:33,340
it understand you're just a kid I didn't
need anything mr. Foster I'm sorry

175
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,610
ginger I did just what was a surprise
that heard what he said about me in his

176
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:43,390
letter What did he say about you Halle
you want to wear a bell around your neck

177
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:49,390
Kelly doesn't mean you're her about
anything it's getting late I better go

178
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:55,020
home I promised my girls heads late good
night good night

179
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:02,230
what's your secret man I've been working
on it for two months have you just too

180
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:09,850
subtle it's not my business but took a
big chance I did yeah I think if

181
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:13,990
Overland finds you poking around in the
confidential files he'd probably fire

182
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:20,500
you right on the spot probably yeah but
Dad I wouldn't worry about Kelly he

183
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:27,460
won't find out unless somebody tells him
well she's not telling exactly why

184
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,850
should you

185
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:12,290
we can't hold this thing here it's
extending to the air-conditioning

186
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:35,890
don't let this thing get around back of
us we'll never get up

187
00:31:54,969 --> 00:31:58,969
he's broken through the 19th chief the
air conditions must have tripped on the

188
00:31:58,969 --> 00:32:02,269
convoy that shut it off give me five
more minutes we're bringing up 40

189
00:32:02,269 --> 00:32:04,849
ejectives on the elevator right now I've
got a really crew kimono I gotta shut

190
00:32:04,849 --> 00:32:07,369
the building down and get your light
generators up to the fire floor one all

191
00:32:07,369 --> 00:32:11,960
right okay instead of Italian one Jeff
go ahead Nicky get a crew down to the

192
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,359
basement right away she chopped off a
whole part of the building everything

193
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:24,559
it's probably quick on fire something in
the basement nothing to worry about Gigi

194
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:29,570
mom you could I forget me Darlene would
you get my briefcase that's that brown

195
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:37,969
one on the desk in there you think I
should go fireball that's a good idea

196
00:32:37,969 --> 00:32:41,049
but maybe we ought to find out what it
is for it

197
00:32:41,049 --> 00:32:45,589
wonder if stash is still downstairs ten
after eight on Christmas hating I don't

198
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:48,769
know everything's gonna be all right
ginger

breathe too much of this stuff well my

200
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:05,330

201
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:10,099
way up we should be out in the fresh air
in a couple minutes this is one way to

202
00:33:10,099 --> 00:33:26,799
break up a party those are the emergency
lights yeah there's that

203
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:44,150
well can't you break it down or
something solid steel Hong Kong fix that

204
00:33:56,210 --> 00:34:09,650
dead fly those lines over there

205
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:16,379
we'll try the phones across the hall

206
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:20,230
might be better to wait in my office
least we'll be away from the smoke until

207
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:24,819
we decide what to do but are we going
we're gonna be safe this is a solid

208
00:34:24,819 --> 00:34:33,090
build ginger not barn all right you
stick with me we're gonna

209
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:09,020
we don't pitch this thing out here it's
going to run sweat off the windows and

210
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,680
it's a long way down

211
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,310
give me some more line

212
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:42,349
even though we can hardly see any
visible evidence of a fire from our

213
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:45,829
vantage point here on the street Fire
Department tells us there are now at

214
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:48,950
least seven floors involved and they
still have not been able to bring it

215
00:35:48,950 --> 00:36:03,680
under control I remember now
they sealed off these windows when I put

216
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,309
in the air conditioning well can't you
break one they're reinforced with wire

217
00:36:07,309 --> 00:36:10,970
good what to do anyway I mean but 40
stories high well we could yell with

218
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:14,180
somebody down the street don't be stupid
Betty they couldn't hear us from up here

219
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:26,150
they could even see us at night might be
why is it going easy on that stuff

220
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:36,109
Howard that a management directive or
just a personal opinion nothing like a

221
00:36:36,109 --> 00:36:41,049
little get-together with the Home Office
once a year Dan

222
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,980
we understand this is only about 30
minutes after the last group of people

223
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,100
left the building where they had been
having an office party on the top floor

224
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,670
it can't be thankful that these lucky
people are home now safe with their

225
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:18,300
families what a blessing this fire
didn't start earlier when the building

elevator shaft adds yet another grim
complication to this Christmas Eve

01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:24,480
tragic read the victim has tentatively
been identified as an employee of the

380

hendrik industries which we understand
occupies the top five floors in the

381

faces the possibility that there may be

382
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:36,319

407
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:50,340
please you well how nice I thought for
some obscure reason that hanging Benji

408
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:54,960
started with care might make things a
little happier around here don't you

409
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:58,410

stocking first alright oh I could see

alright let's talk about it again
never mind I said let's go me Dad no

412
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:12,270
what about last month a picture of Benji
at that summer camp and before that a

413
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:15,690
relaxing evening with a stamp collection
now it's got to stop

414
01:11:15,690 --> 01:11:19,650
Benji seems to be the only thing we have
in common these days in fact I think he

415
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:22,380
probably was the only thing we ever had
that kept us together and we made a

416
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:27,270
mistake obviously since we can't even
talk about our own son anymore Benji is

417
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:45,740
dead summer he's been dead for six
months I'm sorry

418
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:51,419
I'm sorry

419
01:11:52,110 --> 01:12:01,619

01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:07,640
Pharr is now completely out of control
an attempt to stop it on the 36th floor

422
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:10,010
has failed
costing the life of one fireman and

423
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:14,810
critically injuring several others if
the rumor is true if there are still

424
01:13:14,810 --> 01:13:18,739
people on the upper floors there is grim
doubt that they could survive the

425
01:13:18,739 --> 01:13:22,760
intense heat and smoke the fire
department is still struggling

426
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:26,120
desperately to stop the upper floors
from being engulfed by flame but there

427
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:29,890
doesn't seem to be much chance that they
can do it

428
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:50,440

01:29:35,809 --> 01:29:47,770
I don't think you'd make a very good
swing of mr. that's

470
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:55,230
you're okay never thought I'd see the
senior vice president looking such a

471
01:29:55,230 --> 01:30:10,359
mess. I never thought I'd be such a
mess.

472
01:30:10,420 --> 01:30:45,120
I think somebody wants to see you

473
01:30:45,889 --> 01:31:38,840
Come on, can't we try? can't we learn to be good to each other again?

474
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:52,770
Hey, we're alive. that's where something isn't it?

475
01:31:52,770 --> 01:32:02,420
I was just scared. look I've got an idea
why don't you and me spend Christmas together?

476
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:27,200
and buy something we like for each other.
