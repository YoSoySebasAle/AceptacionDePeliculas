1
00:02:56,335 --> 00:02:57,293
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:02:57,294 --> 00:02:58,294
the captain has informed me

3
00:02:58,295 --> 00:02:59,837
our estimated time of arrival

4
00:02:59,838 --> 00:03:01,969
in hapalla, Mexico, is 1:15.

5
00:03:04,009 --> 00:03:06,095
Did you say something to me?

6
00:03:06,512 --> 00:03:07,428
No.

7
00:03:07,429 --> 00:03:08,221
That was the stewardess.

8
00:03:08,222 --> 00:03:09,772
We're almost there.

9
00:03:11,183 --> 00:03:12,733
Great.

10
00:03:13,685 --> 00:03:16,646
You know, this is a lost art.

11
00:03:16,647 --> 00:03:18,564
Her techniques haven't
been used for years,

12
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:21,151
and the results, magnificent.

13
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:23,369
Hmm.

14
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,530
This one goes to susie baker.

15
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:27,824
Her address is...

16
00:03:27,825 --> 00:03:28,741
It's okay, honey.

17
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,785
I have all addresses right here.

18
00:03:30,786 --> 00:03:32,336
Okay.

19
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,790
I didn't know she
had so many friends.

20
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:37,797
She's written
most of them twice.

21
00:03:43,132 --> 00:03:45,013
Look at this, sweetheart.

22
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,010
This is the doll

23
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:50,513
your daddy's going
to make in Mexico.

24
00:03:50,514 --> 00:03:51,889
You see?

25
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:53,474
This is the factory where
we're going to make her

26
00:03:53,475 --> 00:03:55,017
and sew her little dresses.

27
00:03:55,018 --> 00:03:56,519
Isn't she beautiful?

28
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,105
And you are gonna be the
only little girl in the world

29
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,982
whose daddy makes
such beautiful dolls.

30
00:04:00,983 --> 00:04:02,900
Won't we have fun?

31
00:04:02,901 --> 00:04:05,316
We are going to
be such a success!

32
00:04:05,821 --> 00:04:08,407
Can we go back to
Los Angeles then?

33
00:04:27,426 --> 00:04:28,384
Sefior Wade.

34
00:04:28,385 --> 00:04:29,927
Sefior Wade.

35
00:04:29,928 --> 00:04:31,593
What a pleasure at last.

36
00:04:31,763 --> 00:04:33,097
Welcome to Mexico

37
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:34,098
hello.

38
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:35,892
Senor Wade, here

and your escrow got
closed at nine A.M.

41
00:04:41,106 --> 00:04:43,691
And this is a letter
from the city of hapalla

42
00:04:43,692 --> 00:04:45,776

43

in the opening

44
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,614
of the Dolly dearest
manufacturing company.

45
00:04:49,615 --> 00:04:51,746
Hurry up with the suitcases!

46
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:52,992
Oh.

47
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,327
Senora Wade, we have
worked very hard

48
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:56,787
in making your home
comfortable for you.

49
00:04:56,788 --> 00:04:58,122
I hope you'll be satisfied.

50
00:04:58,123 --> 00:04:59,913
I'm sure we will be.

51
00:05:12,888 --> 00:05:14,347
Camilla!

52
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:15,139
Camilla.

53
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,265
Prepare the green chilies.

54
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:17,725
Yes.

55
00:05:17,726 --> 00:05:19,185
Please take the suitcases!

56
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:19,936
Yes ma'am.

57
00:05:19,937 --> 00:05:21,020
This is Camilla.

58
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,313
She will take very
good care of you.

59
00:05:22,314 --> 00:05:23,689
Welcome, sefora Wade.

00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,482
Welcome.

61
00:05:24,483 --> 00:05:26,150
Welcome, senor Wade.

62
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:27,068
Thank you.

63
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:29,075
Hello little Wade children

64
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,280
your belongings
have arrived safely

65
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:32,949
and I'm unpacking
them for you now.

66
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,500
Come in.

67
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,046
Hey, it's a cool house.

68
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,090
I wasn't expecting this.

69
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:50,424
You like to read?

70
00:05:50,425 --> 00:05:52,385
There is much history of
our country in these books.

71
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:53,936
No kidding?

72
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,306
Jessie?

73
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:40,891
Sefior Wade, you
want to go to the factory?

74
00:06:40,892 --> 00:06:42,442
Let's go.

75
00:06:44,896 --> 00:06:45,938
Daddy?

76
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,729
Can I please go with you?

77
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:50,235
Of course, honey, come on.

78
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:57,247
Come on, let's take a
look at our new business.

79
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:00,241
It's okay go on.

80
00:07:17,846 --> 00:07:20,307
We're here.

81
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:38,412
Yecchh.

82
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:43,829
Senora deluga make
the finest dolls

83
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,664
in the whole world.

84
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:46,832
She win many awards.

85
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,209
When I was a little
child, I would come here

86
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,920
just to watch them
paint the little faces,

87
00:07:50,921 --> 00:07:54,588
and such a beautiful doll she
create just before she die.

88
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,467
It's a great pleasure

89
00:07:56,468 --> 00:07:58,508
having handled this
for you, Mr. Wade.

90
00:07:59,304 --> 00:08:00,971
It's my first sale.

91
00:08:00,972 --> 00:08:03,557
Mr. Estrella, the
appraisal documents indicated

92
00:08:03,558 --> 00:08:05,184
the factory had been kept up

93
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,520
after sefiora deluga's death.

94
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:08,854
Yes, sir.

95
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:09,897
We have been very careful

96
00:08:09,898 --> 00:08:13,651
to keep everything
just as it was.

97
00:08:13,652 --> 00:08:15,945
Why, no one ever
comes to the factory,

98
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:17,576
not for any reason.

99
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:23,744
Yes.

100
00:08:23,745 --> 00:08:25,295
I see.

101
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,792
Come, let me show you over here

102
00:08:29,793 --> 00:08:32,299
where all the molding
equipment's been stored.

103
00:08:35,966 --> 00:08:37,216
Mr. Estrella,

104
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:39,885
what's this big,
round mixing thing?

105
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,053
Oh, that is where

106
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,514
they combine all the ingredients

107
00:08:43,515 --> 00:08:45,065
to make the deluga dolls.

108
00:09:07,956 --> 00:09:09,707
The future
heartthrob of millions

109
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,258
of little girls.

110
00:09:14,045 --> 00:09:16,381
Once in a lifetime opportunity.

111
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:18,716
Si, of course, seiior,

112
00:09:18,717 --> 00:09:21,302
I understand that.

113
00:09:21,303 --> 00:09:23,429
We need a little
cleaning, perhaps.

114
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,265
The market projections.

115
00:09:26,516 --> 00:09:28,684
The assessments.

116
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:29,852
Who prepared that material?

117
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:31,854
1, 1 did that, sir.

118
00:09:31,855 --> 00:09:34,396
I copy from American
business book.

119
00:09:34,858 --> 00:09:36,408
Nice work.

120
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:15,022
Jessica, are you in here?

121
00:10:15,023 --> 00:10:17,313
I'm up here, daddy.

122
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,535
Look what I found.

123
00:10:24,032 --> 00:10:25,662
May I have one, daddy?

124
00:10:28,787 --> 00:10:31,623
Oh, look at that.

125
00:10:32,123 --> 00:10:33,708
Fabulous.

126
00:10:34,793 --> 00:10:37,002
Every little girl in the world

127
00:10:37,003 --> 00:10:39,259
is going to want one of those.

128
00:10:39,756 --> 00:10:41,306
I want

129
00:10:43,134 --> 00:10:44,684
that one.

130
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:46,095
Well, you've got it.

131
00:10:46,096 --> 00:10:47,646
My first sale.

132
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,068
Thank you, daddy.

133
00:11:01,069 --> 00:11:02,819
I'm going to love her so much.

134
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:06,415
Jimmy!

135
00:11:08,785 --> 00:11:11,954
Uh, Mr. Estrella, what is that?

136
00:11:11,955 --> 00:11:13,289
What's going on over there?

137
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,165
That is Mayan ruins.

138
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:17,835
They uncover much history
of Mayan civilization.

139
00:11:17,836 --> 00:11:19,421
Very important find.

140
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,047
Mayan, huh?

141
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,008
We studied about
them last semester.

142
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:25,676
They were pretty cool dudes.

143
00:11:25,677 --> 00:11:26,969
Cool or not,

144
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,345
I don't want you
going over there.

145
00:11:28,346 --> 00:11:30,055
Yeah, last week they had
an unfortunate accident.

146
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,015
A man was crushed

147
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:33,517
by a stone underneath the earth.

148
00:11:33,518 --> 00:11:34,476
Work's been suspended

149
00:11:34,477 --> 00:11:35,436
until the archeologist

150
00:11:35,437 --> 00:11:37,354
from the university arrives.

151
00:11:37,355 --> 00:11:38,905
I'm going to

152
00:11:39,608 --> 00:11:41,489
brush your hair.

153
00:11:42,694 --> 00:11:45,576
So the end of a long day.

154
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:49,950
Tomorrow we'll all
start unpacking.

155
00:11:49,951 --> 00:11:52,119
Now, won't that be fun?

156
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,830
Probably not.

157
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,586
Good night, sweetheart.

158
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:03,344
Don't forget
to say good night to Dolly.

159
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,176
Sweet dreams, Dolly.

160
00:12:17,062 --> 00:12:18,612
Good night, Dolly.

161
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:21,403
You're going to be
my new playmate.

162
00:12:22,692 --> 00:12:25,358
You're going to be
my only playmate.

163
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:53,348
Mmm, these
vegetables smell good.

164
00:12:54,182 --> 00:12:56,438
These all come from
my brother's garden.

165
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:59,395
I get you good price, of course.

166
00:12:59,396 --> 00:13:01,480
He uses fresh Turkey manure.

167
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,190
Turkey manure is the very best.

168
00:13:03,191 --> 00:13:04,942
It gives you the best crop.

169
00:13:04,943 --> 00:13:05,985
Really?

170
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:06,777
Mm-hmm.

171
00:13:06,778 --> 00:13:07,903
I didn't know that.

172
00:13:07,904 --> 00:13:09,321
Now, my sister,

173
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,615
she makes us all very proud.

174
00:13:11,616 --> 00:13:13,497
She gave her life to the church.

175
00:13:14,577 --> 00:13:18,330
She belongs to the nuns of the
carmelitas, the carmelites.

176
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:19,123
Really?

177
00:13:19,124 --> 00:13:20,457
Uh-huh.

178
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:21,375
Mommy!

179
00:13:21,376 --> 00:13:22,960
Just leave it on the table

180
00:13:22,961 --> 00:13:24,753
with the other letters, honey.

181
00:13:24,754 --> 00:13:28,467
I wanted to tell
you I'll be in the back yard.

182
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:37,806
You and I can go play
in the Dollhouse.

183
00:14:33,156 --> 00:14:35,282
Jessie, is that you?

184
00:14:35,283 --> 00:14:37,243
We're almost ready to go, honey.

185
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:08,813
Is anyone out there?

186
00:15:51,943 --> 00:15:53,068
What is it?

187
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:54,619
Mom, what is it?

188
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,916
Jessica!

189
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:08,709
Jessica!

190
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,501
Jessica!

191
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,628
Tell me what's wrong.

192
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:13,919
What's wrong with her?

193
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:22,556
No!

194
00:16:22,557 --> 00:16:24,391
I want Dolly!

195
00:16:24,392 --> 00:16:25,942
Jimmy.

196
00:16:26,561 --> 00:16:27,853
Camilla.

197
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:28,770
Camilla?

198
00:16:28,771 --> 00:16:30,480
What is the priest doing here?

199
00:16:30,481 --> 00:16:32,149
I called the priest
to bless the house.

200
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,700
It is custom.

201
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,933
Professor resnick.

202
00:17:05,934 --> 00:17:07,184
What?

203
00:17:07,185 --> 00:17:08,727
The photos from
hapalla have arrived.

204
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:10,734
Ah, at last.

205
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,750
What do you think?
Could this be the tomb?

206
00:17:23,701 --> 00:17:25,251
I'm not sure.

207
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:30,333
Have you ever seen
this symbol before?

208
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:32,342
No, sir.

209
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:35,293
I'm certain it's not Mayan.

210
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:37,923
They haven't disturbed

211
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:39,258
the sarcophagus, have they?

212
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:40,509
No, no one has touched a thing

213
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,340
since larabe's body was removed.

214
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:44,979
When are you leaving?

215
00:17:45,348 --> 00:17:46,556
Bob larabe and I

216
00:17:46,557 --> 00:17:48,016
were friends for over 30 years.

217
00:17:48,017 --> 00:17:49,567
Did you know that?

218
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:50,936
No, sir.

219
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,487
I'm leaving right now.

220
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:57,901
How is she?

221
00:17:57,902 --> 00:17:59,452
She seems all right.

222
00:18:00,238 --> 00:18:03,031
We had a long talk about her
old playmates at school mostly.

223
00:18:03,032 --> 00:18:05,534
I wish you would
have seen her, Elliot.

224
00:18:05,535 --> 00:18:06,910
She scared me,

225
00:18:06,911 --> 00:18:08,954
really scared me.

226
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:09,955
There's no reason for it.

227
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:11,506
None.

228
00:18:11,874 --> 00:18:13,709
I'm gonna take Jimmy with
me to the factory tomorrow

229
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:16,003
and give you two
some time together.

230
00:18:16,004 --> 00:18:16,795
Good.

231
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:18,346
That, that would help.

232
00:18:21,592 --> 00:18:24,302
The sewing machines arrive
next week. Did I tell you?

233
00:18:25,555 --> 00:18:26,722
Oh, yes.

234
00:18:26,723 --> 00:18:28,273
You told me.

235
00:18:48,202 --> 00:18:50,492
It's a secret.

236
00:18:53,124 --> 00:18:54,458
That's funny.

237
00:18:54,459 --> 00:18:56,670
Why are you doing that?

238
00:19:05,887 --> 00:19:07,722
Jessica, what are you doing?

239
00:19:08,431 --> 00:19:10,642
Dolly says we're
going to like it here.

240
00:19:12,602 --> 00:19:15,643
Oh, we are going to
like it here, honey.

241
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:17,939
Now, come on.

242
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,696
Let's go to bed.

243
00:21:59,977 --> 00:22:02,688
Well, it looks like
you're enjoying your lunch.

244
00:22:06,943 --> 00:22:08,652
What is that, honey?

245
00:22:08,653 --> 00:22:10,737
I don't know.

246
00:22:10,738 --> 00:22:12,906
Well, did you see it somewhere?

247
00:22:12,907 --> 00:22:14,533
Dolly told me.

248
00:22:14,534 --> 00:22:16,409
She says she's been
waiting for a little girl

249
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,120
just like me.

250
00:22:20,498 --> 00:22:22,083
Sweetheart.

251
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,105
Jessica!

252
00:22:45,106 --> 00:22:46,398
Jessica, I saw that!

253
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:47,983
Camilla, I am so sorry.

254
00:22:47,984 --> 00:22:50,026
She, I, I don't know
what's gotten into her.

255
00:22:50,027 --> 00:22:51,737
Kinta kintero.

256
00:22:52,405 --> 00:22:54,114
What?

257
00:22:54,115 --> 00:22:56,074
Jessica!

258
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:57,785
Jessica, come back here!

259
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:03,164
Camilla, I am terribly sorry.

260
00:23:03,165 --> 00:23:05,500
She's never had outbursts
like this before.

261
00:23:05,501 --> 00:23:07,051
It is the sanzia.

262
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,796
She spoke the ancient
language of the sanzia.

263
00:23:09,797 --> 00:23:11,965
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
what are you talking about?

264
00:23:11,966 --> 00:23:13,972
I know of their language.

265
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:16,678
I know of these people.

266
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:19,311
Their spirits fly
with the evil one.

267
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:20,890
No.

268
00:23:20,891 --> 00:23:22,441
No.

269
00:23:39,577 --> 00:23:42,618
I know that you wouldn't lie.

270
00:23:44,582 --> 00:23:45,957
I won't tell.

271
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,089
I can keep a secret.

272
00:23:56,385 --> 00:23:57,927
What do you want?

273
00:23:57,928 --> 00:24:00,309
Don't talk to me in
that tone, young lady.

274
00:24:02,183 --> 00:24:03,516
Why did you push Camilla?

275
00:24:03,517 --> 00:24:04,476
I saw you do it.

276
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:05,393
Why?

277
00:24:05,394 --> 00:24:07,228
Camilla prays to the spirits,

278
00:24:07,229 --> 00:24:10,106
and her spirits hate Dolly.

279
00:24:10,107 --> 00:24:11,657
Jessie,

280
00:24:13,444 --> 00:24:16,404
whatever it was you
said to Camilla,

281
00:24:16,405 --> 00:24:18,031
did you hear it from her?

282
00:24:18,032 --> 00:24:18,990
Dolly told me.

283
00:24:18,991 --> 00:24:21,117
Stop saying that!

284
00:24:21,118 --> 00:24:22,748
Now, where did you hear it?

285
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:25,455
Okay come on.

286
00:24:25,456 --> 00:24:27,165
I want you to
apologize to Camilla.

287
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,716
Leave Dolly here.

288
00:24:42,807 --> 00:24:46,099
I'm sorry I pushed your plate.

289
00:24:51,482 --> 00:24:53,066
Camilla, I don't
want to interfere

290
00:24:53,067 --> 00:24:55,026
with your religious
practices, but...

291
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:58,113
Sefora, there is evil here.

292
00:24:58,114 --> 00:24:59,406
I can feel it.

293
00:24:59,407 --> 00:25:01,908
I pray to protect us
from the evil spirit.

294
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:03,076
Right, right, right.

295
00:25:03,077 --> 00:25:04,627
That's my point.

296
00:25:05,162 --> 00:25:06,663
In the future, I
would appreciate it

297
00:25:06,664 --> 00:25:08,832
if you could just, uh,

298
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:11,292
make your observances
more private.

299
00:25:11,293 --> 00:25:12,168
If you could just...

300
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:13,719
I understand.

301
00:25:14,422 --> 00:25:17,213
Today I spoke to my
sister in the convent.

302
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:20,510
I think it's best that
you find someone else

303
00:25:20,511 --> 00:25:22,061
for your house.

304
00:25:28,853 --> 00:25:31,020
Where are you going?

305
00:25:31,021 --> 00:25:33,606
We're just going out
for a quick dinner.

306
00:25:33,607 --> 00:25:36,234
Did you have a good
time with mommy today?

307
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:37,785
It was okay.

308
00:25:38,487 --> 00:25:40,493
She's been acting
very funny lately.

309
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:44,075
Maybe you should
have a talk with her.

310
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:45,906
I don't think she likes it here.

311
00:25:46,495 --> 00:25:48,121
Do you know what?

312
00:25:48,122 --> 00:25:49,672
I think you're right,

313
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:52,961
and we're going to have to
be very patient with mommy.

314
00:26:03,888 --> 00:26:04,929
Good night, honey.

315
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,265
Good night, daddy.

316
00:26:07,266 --> 00:26:09,226
Good night, Dolly.

317
00:26:19,987 --> 00:26:21,537
Dolly?

318
00:26:26,827 --> 00:26:28,377
Dolly?

319
00:26:42,384 --> 00:26:44,640
Dolly, where are you?

320
00:26:57,817 --> 00:27:01,859
Dolly, don't hide
from me, please.

321
00:27:17,795 --> 00:27:19,345
Dolly?

322
00:27:29,306 --> 00:27:30,856
Dolly?

323
00:27:41,777 --> 00:27:43,942
Dolly, where are you?

324
00:28:26,155 --> 00:28:29,037
Jessie, follow me.

325
00:28:52,681 --> 00:28:54,391
Jessica.

326
00:29:08,864 --> 00:29:10,414
Jessica!

327
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,367
What are you doing?

328
00:29:12,368 --> 00:29:14,454
Come back in the house.

329
00:29:17,247 --> 00:29:18,915
Jessica!

330
00:29:18,916 --> 00:29:20,876
Why aren't you listening to
me qirl?

331
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:23,334
I'm talking to you.

332
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,842
Jessica, you come
back in the house.

333
00:29:41,522 --> 00:29:42,563
You sit down.

334
00:29:42,564 --> 00:29:44,399
I'll go around the front.

335
00:30:05,587 --> 00:30:07,137
Jimmy!

336
00:30:07,965 --> 00:30:09,515
Open the door!

337
00:30:12,302 --> 00:30:14,638
Ay! This kid.

338
00:31:26,794 --> 00:31:28,959
Jessica, is that you?

339
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:43,973
Jessie, now we can play.

340
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,470
No lights.

341
00:34:16,964 --> 00:34:18,923
Camilla said there was a problem

342
00:34:18,924 --> 00:34:20,508
with the fuse box.

343
00:34:20,509 --> 00:34:22,059
I'll check.

344
00:35:07,055 --> 00:35:07,972
Jimmy?

345
00:35:07,973 --> 00:35:09,640
Huh?

346
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:11,191
You scared me.

347
00:35:11,226 --> 00:35:12,518
What's with the candle?

348
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:13,894
The electricity is out.

349
00:35:13,895 --> 00:35:15,146
Is your sister in here?

350
00:35:15,147 --> 00:35:16,697
No.

351
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:18,357
Maybe she's with Camilla.

352
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:19,908
I'll go.

353
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,580
Camilla's not there.

354
00:36:18,377 --> 00:36:20,669
Well, then they
must be together.

355
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,380
I bet they're in your room.

356
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,436
Oh.

357
00:36:37,437 --> 00:36:38,987
Damn it.

358
00:36:40,857 --> 00:36:42,487
Maybe they're downstairs.

359
00:36:43,151 --> 00:36:45,237
She's so afraid
of the lightning.

360
00:37:28,155 --> 00:37:29,905
Jessie?

361
00:37:29,906 --> 00:37:31,616
She's not in there.

362
00:37:33,243 --> 00:37:34,368
Oh, my god.

363
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:36,250
She's in the Dollhouse.

364
00:38:15,785 --> 00:38:18,120
I'll get you all tucked in

365
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:20,164
and cozy and I'll read
you a bedtime story.

366
00:38:20,165 --> 00:38:22,124
Would you like that?

367
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:23,459
I just spoke with her family.

368
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,716
They're making all
the arrangements.

369
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:32,427
Are you okay?

370
00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:33,153
Jessica,
would you lock the door?

371
00:39:33,154 --> 00:39:35,114
Lock the door now.

372
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:39,910
That's a good girl.

373
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:41,792
Ah, she's listening.

374
00:39:50,839 --> 00:39:53,132
If she comes, don't open it.

375
00:39:53,133 --> 00:39:54,683
No, no.

376
00:39:57,971 --> 00:40:00,307
Jessica, don't open it.

377
00:40:01,975 --> 00:40:03,605
Jessie, open up the door.

378
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:06,319
Jessica?

379
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,875
What did you do to your hair?

380
00:40:27,876 --> 00:40:29,460
We cut it.

381
00:40:29,461 --> 00:40:31,170
Don't I look like Dolly now?

382
00:40:31,171 --> 00:40:33,005
Jessica, you were
holding the door.

383
00:40:33,006 --> 00:40:34,256
Dolly locked the door.

384
00:40:34,257 --> 00:40:36,050
She doesn't like
people coming in here.

385
00:40:36,051 --> 00:40:37,551
This is our house.

386
00:40:37,552 --> 00:40:39,845
Jessie, I want you
to leave Dolly here

387
00:40:39,846 --> 00:40:41,347
and I want you to come with me.

388
00:40:41,348 --> 00:40:42,139
No, thank you.

389
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,975
We'd rather stay here.

390
00:40:49,272 --> 00:40:52,063
I'm sorry, mommy.

391
00:40:53,943 --> 00:40:55,194
It's just that Dolly's

392
00:40:55,195 --> 00:40:57,029
the only friend I have,

393
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:59,116
and I don't want to lose her.

394
00:40:59,866 --> 00:41:02,951
Can I stay for just
a little while?

395
00:41:02,952 --> 00:41:04,953
I'll leave the door open.

396
00:41:04,954 --> 00:41:07,244
I love you, mommy.

397
00:41:07,957 --> 00:41:10,042
I love you, too.

398
00:41:10,043 --> 00:41:12,174
I love you so much.

399
00:41:14,798 --> 00:41:15,756
Are you okay?

400
00:41:15,757 --> 00:41:18,092
I'm okay, mommy.

401
00:41:18,093 --> 00:41:20,719
I am.

402
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,476
Okay.

403
00:42:07,475 --> 00:42:08,267
God!

404
00:42:08,268 --> 00:42:09,601
Sorry.

405
00:42:09,602 --> 00:42:11,854
Come on! Get
the hell out of there!

406
00:42:11,855 --> 00:42:13,230
Hi.

407
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:15,691
Uh, you're the archeologist
from the university?

408
00:42:15,692 --> 00:42:17,025
Hi.

409
00:42:17,026 --> 00:42:18,277
I'm Jimmy Wade. My dad owns
the factory over there.

410
00:42:18,278 --> 00:42:19,987
Son, the sign up
there says "no pase."

411
00:42:19,988 --> 00:42:21,989
That means this entire
area is off limits,

412
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:23,655
so please, take a hike.

413
00:42:24,367 --> 00:42:25,451
Okay, but you're
going to need my help

414
00:42:25,452 --> 00:42:27,208
when you get down in there.

415
00:42:28,371 --> 00:42:30,456
Further down, you'll
see the top is caved in,

416
00:42:30,457 --> 00:42:32,040
the opening's too small.

417
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:33,500
You won't be able
to squeeze through.

418
00:42:33,501 --> 00:42:35,294
I'll take my chances.

419
00:42:35,295 --> 00:42:36,845
I'll wait.

420
00:43:23,843 --> 00:43:25,177
How far back have
you been in there?

421
00:43:25,178 --> 00:43:27,387
Uh, only about halfway,

422
00:43:27,388 --> 00:43:30,145
but I can squeeze
through to the end.

423
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,100
I can do it.

424
00:43:32,101 --> 00:43:34,228
I can be like your
eyes and ears for you.

425
00:43:34,229 --> 00:43:35,479
What do you think?

426
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,630
Does your father
know you're down here?

427
00:43:37,941 --> 00:43:39,650
Sure, he does.

428
00:43:39,651 --> 00:43:41,068
My father's always
looking for ways

429
00:43:41,069 --> 00:43:43,028
to further my education,

430
00:43:43,029 --> 00:43:46,161
so let me crawl on top
and take a look for you.

431
00:43:46,741 --> 00:43:48,116
I've done it before,

432
00:43:48,117 --> 00:43:48,992
but it's getting
kinda dark in there,

433
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:50,410
if you know what I mean.

434
00:43:50,411 --> 00:43:54,414
Look, I appreciate your
fondness for exploration,

435
00:43:54,415 --> 00:43:56,166
but we'll both just have to wait

436
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:57,751
to see what's inside the crypt.

437
00:43:57,752 --> 00:43:59,211
A crypt.

438
00:43:59,212 --> 00:44:00,879
I knew it was a crypt!

439
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,672
Hey!

440
00:44:01,673 --> 00:44:03,507
Come back here.

441
00:44:03,508 --> 00:44:04,633
Hey.

442
00:44:04,634 --> 00:44:05,425
Oh.

443
00:44:05,426 --> 00:44:06,976
Neat hat.

444
00:44:39,085 --> 00:44:40,875
What do you see?

445
00:44:41,796 --> 00:44:43,505
Uh,

446
00:44:43,506 --> 00:44:44,548
I don't know.

447
00:44:44,549 --> 00:44:46,099
It's real small.

448
00:44:46,301 --> 00:44:48,261
It's a coffin, I guess.

449
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,889
But it's made out
of stone maybe?

450
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,056
All right, that's enough.

451
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:54,607
Come out of there now!

452
00:44:58,354 --> 00:44:59,271
Wow.

453
00:44:59,272 --> 00:45:00,147
What a rush.

454
00:45:00,148 --> 00:45:00,939
Now what?

455
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:01,982
Ow!

456
00:45:01,983 --> 00:45:02,900
Ow!

457
00:45:02,901 --> 00:45:03,817
Don't you ever do that again.

458
00:45:03,818 --> 00:45:04,610
I won't.

459
00:45:04,611 --> 00:45:06,161
You hear?

460
00:45:06,905 --> 00:45:09,364
You know, I've been reading
up you know, on the Mayans

461
00:45:09,365 --> 00:45:10,782
because I wanted to be prepared

462
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:12,075
for when you got here.

463
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:13,869
I mean, you being
from the university

464
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:16,035
and me only being
in seventh grade.

465
00:45:16,706 --> 00:45:18,123
I just didn't want you to think

466
00:45:18,124 --> 00:45:19,041
that I couldn't handle the job,

467
00:45:19,042 --> 00:45:20,459
because I can.

468
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,127
I can handle the job.

469
00:45:22,128 --> 00:45:23,670
What job?

470
00:45:23,671 --> 00:45:25,221
Your assistant.

471
00:45:25,506 --> 00:45:27,215
Does your dad's
factory have a phone?

472
00:45:27,216 --> 00:45:28,008
Oh, sure.

473
00:45:28,009 --> 00:45:29,051
Come on.

474
00:45:29,052 --> 00:45:29,968
He'll let you use it.

475
00:45:29,969 --> 00:45:32,095
So, uh, who's buried in there?

476
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:33,347
A Maya king?

477
00:45:33,348 --> 00:45:34,973
He must be a short guy.

478
00:45:34,974 --> 00:45:37,017
This is like king tut, right?

479
00:45:37,018 --> 00:45:38,568
Are you coming?

480
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:45,700
I'll go get my dad.

481
00:45:50,615 --> 00:45:53,497
Put the boxes over here.

482
00:45:59,290 --> 00:46:02,042
This is my father, Elliot Wade.

483
00:46:02,043 --> 00:46:03,043
Karl resnick.

484
00:46:03,044 --> 00:46:04,878
I hope this isn't an imposition.

485
00:46:04,879 --> 00:46:06,838
You can use my phone anytime.

486
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:08,966
These creatures are beautiful.

487
00:46:08,967 --> 00:46:10,092
Very haunting.

488
00:46:10,093 --> 00:46:11,218
Yes, they are.

489
00:46:11,219 --> 00:46:12,511
The more I'm with them,

490
00:46:12,512 --> 00:46:14,846
the more they take on
a life of their own.

491
00:46:14,847 --> 00:46:18,350
I'm sorry about the
accident at your excavation.

492
00:46:18,351 --> 00:46:19,601
Thank you.

493
00:46:19,602 --> 00:46:21,895
Bob larabe was a
very dedicated man.

494
00:46:21,896 --> 00:46:23,438
If his theory is correct,

495
00:46:23,439 --> 00:46:25,899
this excavation will
answer many questions

496
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,901
about a bizarre tribe of people

497
00:46:27,902 --> 00:46:29,987
called the sanzia.

498
00:46:29,988 --> 00:46:32,030
What do you mean, it's not Maya?

499
00:46:32,031 --> 00:46:33,073
Oh, no.

500
00:46:33,074 --> 00:46:34,491
Not Maya.

501
00:46:34,492 --> 00:46:38,537
The sanzias occupied this
area about 900 years ago.

502
00:46:38,538 --> 00:46:41,665
Sanzia means Satan on earth.

503
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:43,041
Sounds fascinating.

504
00:46:43,042 --> 00:46:44,167
When do you start?

505
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:45,377
I'll start tonight.

506
00:46:45,378 --> 00:46:46,920
My men will arrive tomorrow.

507
00:46:46,921 --> 00:46:49,715
The pipe! The pipe!
There's water all over!

508
00:46:49,716 --> 00:46:51,133
Okay water main.

509
00:46:51,134 --> 00:46:52,092
Excuse me.

510
00:46:52,093 --> 00:46:53,010
The phone is in the corner.

511
00:46:53,011 --> 00:46:54,177
Help yourself.

512
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:55,728
Give me a hand.

513
00:46:57,348 --> 00:46:58,898
Tonight, huh?

514
00:46:59,642 --> 00:47:01,226
When the sun disappears,

515
00:47:01,227 --> 00:47:03,020
I expect your face
to go with it.

516
00:47:03,021 --> 00:47:04,571
Understood?

517
00:47:09,652 --> 00:47:10,569
Sanzia.

518
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:12,070
Sanzia.

519
00:47:12,071 --> 00:47:13,701
"Cult of the dead."

520
00:47:30,131 --> 00:47:31,681
Wow.

521
00:48:04,373 --> 00:48:06,413
It's may the third.

522
00:48:06,918 --> 00:48:08,958
1900 hours.

523
00:48:15,051 --> 00:48:16,601
I'm in the tunnel.

524
00:48:19,514 --> 00:48:22,015
I have already observed

525
00:48:22,016 --> 00:48:24,059
these inscriptions
on the photographs

526
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:26,269
sent to me by larabe.

527
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:28,731
They appear to be sanzia.

528
00:48:29,899 --> 00:48:33,031
I'm going to remove
the earth by hand.

529
00:48:48,793 --> 00:48:50,502
No, we already finished.

530
00:48:50,503 --> 00:48:52,003
When will you be home?

531
00:48:52,004 --> 00:48:53,588
In about an hour.

532
00:48:53,589 --> 00:48:54,464
The fridge again?

533
00:48:54,465 --> 00:48:55,423
No, it's not that.

534
00:48:55,424 --> 00:48:56,974
It's, uh,

535
00:48:58,553 --> 00:49:00,138
it's Jessica.

536
00:49:00,972 --> 00:49:02,013
What's wrong with her?

537
00:49:02,014 --> 00:49:02,764
I don't know what's wrong.

538
00:49:02,765 --> 00:49:05,226
I'm worried about her.

539
00:49:05,768 --> 00:49:07,353
I don't know, uh,

540
00:49:08,396 --> 00:49:09,855
I don't know what to do

541
00:49:09,856 --> 00:49:11,966
about this fixation
she has on the doll.

542
00:49:12,483 --> 00:49:14,673
Let me finish
here, and I'll be home soon.

543
00:49:15,528 --> 00:49:16,528
All right.

544
00:49:16,529 --> 00:49:17,821
Okay sure.

545
00:49:17,822 --> 00:49:19,862
We'll talk about it
when you get back.

546
00:49:20,908 --> 00:49:22,458
Okay

547
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:23,827
I love you.

548
00:49:23,828 --> 00:49:25,378
I love you, too.

549
00:49:32,795 --> 00:49:36,339
Mr. Wade, you join
me in a burrito?

550
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,596
Sounds good, Luis,
but no, thanks.

551
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:41,425
I'm going to be getting
out of here soon.

552
00:49:45,016 --> 00:49:47,976
Well, I think I
better go to bed.

553
00:49:47,977 --> 00:49:49,527
So early?

554
00:49:50,938 --> 00:49:52,488
Good night!

555
00:50:25,806 --> 00:50:26,598
That's it.

556
00:50:26,599 --> 00:50:27,390
I've had it.

557
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:28,225
Luis, it's all yours.

558
00:50:28,226 --> 00:50:29,776
Lock up for me.

559
00:50:29,977 --> 00:50:31,019
Good night.

560
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:32,770
Good night, Mr. Wade.

561
00:51:01,259 --> 00:51:04,302
I can now see
additional inscriptions

562
00:51:04,303 --> 00:51:06,638
on the left side of the crypt.

563
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:08,189
Larabe was right.

564
00:51:08,891 --> 00:51:10,441
They're sanzia.

565
00:51:11,143 --> 00:51:13,979
They are warnings,

566
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:18,239
warnings not to cross the
threshold of the tomb.

567
00:51:44,135 --> 00:51:45,685
Senorita.

568
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:49,102
I say you join me
for dinner, eh?

569
00:51:50,850 --> 00:51:53,476
You look very
lovely tonight, huh?

570
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:55,270
Heh heh heh heh!

571
00:51:55,271 --> 00:51:56,821
Of course

572
00:51:57,148 --> 00:51:59,438
you look lovely every night.

573
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,111
You want to lambada, no?

574
00:52:03,112 --> 00:52:04,662
Whoo-hoo!

575
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:11,246
You come up to my
room later, eh?

576
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,590
No?

577
00:52:16,542 --> 00:52:19,128
You women, you're
all alike, you know?

578
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,087
Well, let me tell you something.

579
00:52:21,088 --> 00:52:22,547
You're ugly,

580
00:52:22,548 --> 00:52:24,966
and your nose is shiny, too.

581
00:52:24,967 --> 00:52:26,517
Heh heh heh heh!

582
00:52:29,555 --> 00:52:31,140
You got a big head.

583
00:52:32,308 --> 00:52:34,064
All women have big heads.

584
00:52:49,158 --> 00:52:50,950
You wait here.

585
00:52:50,951 --> 00:52:52,707
I'll be right back.

586
00:53:53,931 --> 00:53:56,597
Hey, hey, give me a hand.

587
00:55:35,824 --> 00:55:37,374
Surprise.

588
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:40,370
We got you.

589
00:55:40,371 --> 00:55:42,252
We got you.

590
00:56:29,211 --> 00:56:30,920
The interior of the crypt

591
00:56:30,921 --> 00:56:32,631
is three meters

592
00:56:33,257 --> 00:56:37,260
by three by 2.5 in height.

593
00:56:37,261 --> 00:56:40,302
It doesn't appear that
it's been entered.

594
00:56:42,850 --> 00:56:44,400
It's beautiful.

595
00:56:48,897 --> 00:56:51,938
It's at least 900 years old.

596
00:56:52,484 --> 00:56:54,820
The detail is amazing.

597
00:56:57,489 --> 00:57:01,406
It is the story of creation.

598
00:57:02,828 --> 00:57:04,120
It is the story

599
00:57:04,121 --> 00:57:09,415
of the birth of evil on earth.

600
00:57:16,342 --> 00:57:18,507
Oh, god, larabe.

601
00:57:19,887 --> 00:57:21,517
It is the crypt.

602
00:57:22,264 --> 00:57:24,223
This is where the sanzia

603
00:57:24,224 --> 00:57:26,856
have entombed the devil child.

604
00:58:08,519 --> 00:58:09,477
Oh, man.

605
00:58:09,478 --> 00:58:11,028
What a screw up.

606
00:58:50,769 --> 00:58:53,401
Now we'll have some fun.

607
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:16,528
Is anybody here?

608
01:01:17,958 --> 01:01:18,916
Who are you?

609
01:01:18,917 --> 01:01:19,959
Are you crazy?

610
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:20,751
What are you doing?

611
01:01:20,752 --> 01:01:22,086
You must stop this.

612
01:01:22,087 --> 01:01:24,088
Everybody will be killed
if you do not stop this.

613
01:01:24,089 --> 01:01:25,965
What are you talking
about? Who are you?

614
01:01:25,966 --> 01:01:28,134
You brought their evil back,

615
01:01:28,135 --> 01:01:30,386
with your picks
and your shovels.

616
01:01:30,387 --> 01:01:32,722
Close the tomb now and leave.

617
01:01:32,723 --> 01:01:33,931
The sanzias are dead.

618
01:01:33,932 --> 01:01:35,016
All of them are dead.

619
01:01:35,017 --> 01:01:36,684
He opened up the gate to hell,

620
01:01:36,685 --> 01:01:38,561
and the killings began.

621
01:01:38,562 --> 01:01:40,354
There will be others.

622
01:01:40,355 --> 01:01:43,941
The soul of the
sanzia child is alive.

623
01:01:43,942 --> 01:01:46,068
It has returned.

624
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:47,984
All of the children
are in danger.

625
01:01:48,447 --> 01:01:51,033
Close the tomb now

626
01:01:51,992 --> 01:01:53,873
and maybe god will spare us.

627
01:01:54,578 --> 01:01:55,912
Wait.

628
01:01:55,913 --> 01:01:57,463
Wait!

629
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,373
Wait!

630
01:01:59,374 --> 01:02:01,334
Wait for me!

631
01:02:07,841 --> 01:02:09,391
What was that about?

632
01:02:10,761 --> 01:02:12,428
Superstition.

633
01:02:12,429 --> 01:02:13,804
There's frequent opposition

634
01:02:13,805 --> 01:02:15,598
to dredging up the past,

635
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,808
a past descendants
of the sanzias

636
01:02:17,809 --> 01:02:19,977
would prefer we left in secrecy.

637
01:02:19,978 --> 01:02:21,062
I'm looking for my son.

638
01:02:21,063 --> 01:02:22,146
He snuck out of the house.

639
01:02:22,147 --> 01:02:23,522
I thought he might
be here with you.

640
01:02:23,523 --> 01:02:25,983
Jimmy, my assistant,
the explorer?

641
01:02:25,984 --> 01:02:28,320
No, I haven't seen him, ha, yet.

642
01:03:03,981 --> 01:03:06,317
What's going on here?

643
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:29,839
That's it.

644
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,390
I'm getting out of here.

645
01:03:40,642 --> 01:03:42,727
Dad, there's a man in there.

646
01:03:42,728 --> 01:03:43,519
He's dead!

647
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,270
I saw him!

648
01:03:44,271 --> 01:03:45,062
Jimmy, stop it.

649
01:03:45,063 --> 01:03:46,230
Calm down.

650
01:03:46,231 --> 01:03:47,023
Calm down.

651
01:03:47,024 --> 01:03:48,574
Stay here.

652
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:50,909
Luis!

653
01:03:51,862 --> 01:03:53,412
Luis?

654
01:03:56,908 --> 01:03:58,034
Luis!

655
01:03:58,035 --> 01:03:59,585
Luis!

656
01:04:06,084 --> 01:04:07,634
Hello?

657
01:04:07,669 --> 01:04:09,379
It's an emergency.

658
01:04:09,755 --> 01:04:12,216
We need an ambulance...

659
01:04:12,507 --> 01:04:14,922
At camino El Rey

660
01:04:34,863 --> 01:04:36,903
Looks like it was
a heart attack.

661
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:42,453
Under the circumstances
with Luis,

662
01:04:42,454 --> 01:04:44,244
I'm not going to punish you,

663
01:04:44,748 --> 01:04:47,208
but what you did was
totally irresponsible.

664
01:04:47,209 --> 01:04:49,919
Just what did you think you
were gonna do out there?

665
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,470
I don't know.

666
01:04:52,089 --> 01:04:54,090
Mr. resnick mentioned
that old tribe,

667
01:04:54,091 --> 01:04:55,758
and I read all about them,

668
01:04:55,759 --> 01:04:58,135
how they were like
really weird dudes.

669
01:04:58,136 --> 01:05:00,429
They tried to make, like,

670
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:02,306
an evil kid or something,

671
01:05:02,307 --> 01:05:04,688
you know, a devil
child, they called it.

672
01:05:05,435 --> 01:05:07,311
Sanzias were into
really scary stuff.

673
01:05:07,312 --> 01:05:10,231
It just got me going, I guess.

674
01:05:10,232 --> 01:05:12,149
What did you say the
name of that tribe was?

675
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:13,609
Sanzia.

676
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:15,361
From now on, you
can forget about

677
01:05:15,362 --> 01:05:17,446
some of the more exotic
goings-on around here,

678
01:05:17,447 --> 01:05:20,282
such as Mr. resnick and
the archeological digs.

679
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:21,075
What?

680
01:05:21,076 --> 01:05:22,952
Dad, come on.

681
01:05:22,953 --> 01:05:24,954
The digs are a cool place.

682
01:05:24,955 --> 01:05:26,497
What does that have
to do with anything?

683
01:05:26,498 --> 01:05:28,124
It has to do with your ability

684
01:05:28,125 --> 01:05:30,791
to separate what's
real and what's not.

685
01:05:50,355 --> 01:05:52,395
What are you doing?

686
01:05:53,483 --> 01:05:55,192
I thought that you'd
be more comfortable

687
01:05:55,193 --> 01:05:57,027
if Dolly slept over
there in the chair.

688
01:05:57,028 --> 01:05:58,279
Don't touch her.

689
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:59,363
Jessica, I'm taking the doll

690
01:05:59,364 --> 01:06:00,781
out of the bed

691
01:06:00,782 --> 01:06:03,052
and I don't want hear
another word about it.

692
01:06:04,494 --> 01:06:05,828
I'll kill you!

693
01:06:05,829 --> 01:06:07,830
I'll kill you if you
try to separate us!

694
01:06:07,831 --> 01:06:08,622
I'll kill you!

695
01:06:08,623 --> 01:06:09,623
She's mine!

696
01:06:09,624 --> 01:06:11,000
She's mine!

697
01:06:11,001 --> 01:06:11,917
Whoa!

698
01:06:11,918 --> 01:06:14,004
Neat trick with your voice.

699
01:06:19,176 --> 01:06:24,641
Daddy, mommy's trying to
take Dolly away from me.

700
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:27,892
Don't take her, daddy!

701
01:06:27,893 --> 01:06:28,767
Calm down.

702
01:06:28,768 --> 01:06:30,478
I want my Dolly.

703
01:06:31,855 --> 01:06:32,897
It's okay.

704
01:06:32,898 --> 01:06:36,066
We keep each other company.

705
01:06:36,067 --> 01:06:36,984
Come on.

706
01:06:36,985 --> 01:06:38,694
Get under the covers now.

707
01:06:38,695 --> 01:06:40,245
Jimmy, go to your room.

708
01:06:41,323 --> 01:06:43,407
She said she'd kill me.

709
01:06:43,408 --> 01:06:45,243
If you'd heard
her voice, Elliot.

710
01:06:48,413 --> 01:06:50,247
Elliot, she's changing.

711
01:06:50,248 --> 01:06:51,373
She's, she's changing.

712
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:52,875
It's,

713
01:06:52,876 --> 01:06:54,426
it's the doll.

714
01:06:54,794 --> 01:06:55,920
It's controlling her somehow.

715
01:06:55,921 --> 01:06:58,589
It's doing something to her.

716
01:06:58,590 --> 01:07:00,140
Don't you see it?

717
01:07:00,842 --> 01:07:03,177
No, I don't see it.

718
01:07:03,178 --> 01:07:05,054
I see that you've changed.

719
01:07:05,055 --> 01:07:06,889
What you're saying is
completely irrational.

720
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:08,057
I want to get her out of here.

721
01:07:08,058 --> 01:07:09,225
I'm afraid for her.

722
01:07:09,226 --> 01:07:11,186
I want to take her back to la.

723
01:07:11,895 --> 01:07:14,521
Marilyn, we've
invested everything

724
01:07:14,522 --> 01:07:15,773
into this factory.

725
01:07:15,774 --> 01:07:17,066
We can't just pack up

726
01:07:17,067 --> 01:07:19,457
because our seven-year-old
is having a tantrum.

727
01:07:20,612 --> 01:07:22,162
Honey,

728
01:07:22,656 --> 01:07:24,365
we'll work with her, okay?

729
01:07:24,366 --> 01:07:25,916
She'll be all right.

730
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:28,911
Just let her go
through some changes.

731
01:07:28,912 --> 01:07:31,373
You're not hearing
a word I'm saying.

732
01:07:31,998 --> 01:07:35,084
That man, that man Karl resnick,

733
01:07:35,085 --> 01:07:36,502
what do you know about the crypt

734
01:07:36,503 --> 01:07:37,419
in the field?

735
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,004
Why is he so interested in it?

736
01:07:39,005 --> 01:07:41,298
He's interested because
he's an archeologist.

737
01:07:41,299 --> 01:07:42,549
What are you suggesting?

738
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:43,342
I don't know.

739
01:07:43,343 --> 01:07:44,260
I don't know.

740
01:07:44,261 --> 01:07:46,347
I'm trying to make sense of it.

741
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:50,015
Camilla was frightened
of the sanzia.

742
01:07:50,016 --> 01:07:51,100
She said that Jessica

743
01:07:51,101 --> 01:07:53,143
spoke to her in their language.

744
01:07:53,144 --> 01:07:54,937
You told me yourself
Camilla spent half the day

745
01:07:54,938 --> 01:07:57,024
mumbling over burning candles.

746
01:07:58,817 --> 01:08:01,360
If Jessica said anything,
she heard it from her.

747
01:08:01,361 --> 01:08:02,903
No, she didn't, Elliot.

748
01:08:02,904 --> 01:08:03,904
She heard it from someone,

749
01:08:03,905 --> 01:08:05,455
but it wasn't her.

750
01:08:07,158 --> 01:08:09,198
Okay I'm sorry.

751
01:08:09,869 --> 01:08:12,788
I'm tired, I'm hungry,

752
01:08:12,789 --> 01:08:14,123
it's the middle of the night,

753
01:08:14,124 --> 01:08:16,414
and I don't want to
hear this right now.

754
01:09:02,839 --> 01:09:04,923
Mr. resnick, I'm Marilyn Wade.

755
01:09:04,924 --> 01:09:07,635
Oh, happy to meet
you, sefora Wade.

756
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:11,597
I see your beauty
in your son's face.

757
01:09:11,598 --> 01:09:12,389
How is he?

758
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:13,940
He had a rough night.

759
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:16,018
It was an unfortunate
experience.

760
01:09:16,019 --> 01:09:17,436
Yes, it was.

761
01:09:17,437 --> 01:09:19,355
I wonder if I could talk to you

762
01:09:19,356 --> 01:09:20,689
about these carvings down here.

763
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:21,607
Oh, please.

764
01:09:21,608 --> 01:09:22,858
These.

765
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:26,111
These were removed
from the tomb?

766
01:09:26,112 --> 01:09:27,404
Yes.

767
01:09:27,405 --> 01:09:31,408
Well, actually, they're
portions of the damaged door.

768
01:09:31,409 --> 01:09:34,203
See, the details are exquisite.

769
01:09:34,204 --> 01:09:35,579
These are very old.

770
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:36,789
Sanzia, right?

771
01:09:36,790 --> 01:09:38,340
Correct.

772
01:09:39,292 --> 01:09:41,627
Our son tells us

773
01:09:41,628 --> 01:09:43,588
these people have
a grisly history.

774
01:09:45,090 --> 01:09:47,299
What is it that
you're looking for?

775
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:48,425
We're looking for the remains

776
01:09:48,426 --> 01:09:50,469
of the sanzia devil child.

777
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:51,428
The legends say

778
01:09:51,429 --> 01:09:53,639
the sanzia prepared a place

779
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:56,058
for the birth of Satan's child.

780
01:09:56,059 --> 01:09:57,017
They suckled a child

781
01:09:57,018 --> 01:09:59,019
that was neither man nor beast.

782
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:00,938
It had the body of an infant

783
01:10:00,939 --> 01:10:02,815
and the head of a goat.

784
01:10:02,816 --> 01:10:04,566
They fed it with the warm blood

785
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:06,276
of slaughtered children.

786
01:10:06,277 --> 01:10:08,987
A child so evil that
its reign of terror

787
01:10:08,988 --> 01:10:11,031
almost caused their extinction

788
01:10:11,032 --> 01:10:12,324
before they put the creature

789
01:10:12,325 --> 01:10:13,909
to its howling death.

790
01:10:13,910 --> 01:10:16,203
And you knew this before
you opened the crypt?

791
01:10:16,204 --> 01:10:19,373
Sefora, whatever
made the sanzia afraid,

792
01:10:19,374 --> 01:10:21,667
this child was not supernatural.

793
01:10:21,668 --> 01:10:24,044
- How do you know it wasn't?
- Because I'm a man of reason.

794
01:10:24,045 --> 01:10:25,595
It's not possible.

795
01:10:26,256 --> 01:10:29,633
Mr. resnick, my daughter
has been drawing these symbols

796
01:10:29,634 --> 01:10:31,301
since we arrived here.

797
01:10:31,302 --> 01:10:32,636
Our housekeeper Camilla

798
01:10:32,637 --> 01:10:35,055
told me that Jessica
spoke sanzia to her.

799
01:10:35,056 --> 01:10:38,063
She tried to warn me,
and now she's dead

800
01:10:38,476 --> 01:10:39,893
and so is the night watchman,

801
01:10:39,894 --> 01:10:43,106
and so is your archeologist,

802
01:10:43,898 --> 01:10:45,858
and my daughter is being
touched by something,

803
01:10:45,859 --> 01:10:47,568
by some outside force.

804
01:10:47,569 --> 01:10:49,695
Sefior resnick!
We need help with the machine!

805
01:10:49,696 --> 01:10:51,071
How much time?

806
01:10:51,072 --> 01:10:53,365
Sefiora, where are you going?

807
01:10:53,366 --> 01:10:54,575
Camilla said she has a sister

808
01:10:54,576 --> 01:10:56,126
in the convent.

809
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:58,420
I want to speak with her.

810
01:11:22,061 --> 01:11:25,603
Uh, mom said you
should take a nap.

811
01:11:30,653 --> 01:11:32,654
Um, but that's okay,

812
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:36,368
you don't have to if
you don't want to.

813
01:11:59,766 --> 01:12:01,934
Do you speak english?

814
01:12:01,935 --> 01:12:03,485
Yes, I do.

815
01:12:03,770 --> 01:12:05,896
I'm looking for sister alva.

816
01:12:05,897 --> 01:12:07,447
Sister alva is ill.

817
01:12:08,066 --> 01:12:09,983
A member of her family
has passed away.

818
01:12:09,984 --> 01:12:11,235
Yes, I know.

819
01:12:11,236 --> 01:12:13,028
Please, it's very
important that I see her.

820
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:13,987
She's in seclusion.

821
01:12:13,988 --> 01:12:14,905
Please.

822
01:12:14,906 --> 01:12:17,162
My daughter's life is in danger.

823
01:12:46,271 --> 01:12:47,821
I'm Marilyn Wade.

824
01:12:48,898 --> 01:12:50,448
I know who you are.

825
01:12:53,903 --> 01:12:56,739
I'm very sorry
about your sister.

826
01:13:05,123 --> 01:13:07,629
Did Camilla tell you
about my daughter?

827
01:13:10,128 --> 01:13:12,214
You of the modern world.

828
01:13:13,381 --> 01:13:15,924
You put your faith
in your machines,

829
01:13:15,925 --> 01:13:17,634
your science.

830
01:13:17,635 --> 01:13:20,221
You ignore the powers
of heaven and hell.

831
01:13:21,222 --> 01:13:23,765
My sister tried to warn you.

832
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:26,307
Yes, I know she did.

833
01:13:26,978 --> 01:13:28,562
But, please, tell me now.

834
01:13:28,563 --> 01:13:31,023
What is happening
to my daughter?

835
01:13:31,024 --> 01:13:32,609
How can I stop it?

836
01:13:33,067 --> 01:13:34,617
It's too late.

837
01:13:35,153 --> 01:13:37,195
The spirit of the
sanzia devil child

838
01:13:37,196 --> 01:13:38,113
has been set free.

839
01:13:38,114 --> 01:13:39,406
It's too late.

840
01:13:39,407 --> 01:13:41,742
Listen to me, I'm
not losing my daughter

841
01:13:41,743 --> 01:13:44,909
to a goddamn
900-year-old goat head!

842
01:13:49,876 --> 01:13:51,506
Tell me what you know.

843
01:13:53,004 --> 01:13:55,589
How does this thing,

844
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:57,505
this spirit work?

845
01:13:58,343 --> 01:14:00,599
Could it, could it
go into something

846
01:14:02,221 --> 01:14:04,348
other than a human?

847
01:14:04,349 --> 01:14:06,224
Could it go into a doll?

848
01:14:06,225 --> 01:14:08,731
The devil takes
any form it desires.

849
01:14:09,562 --> 01:14:10,479
It can be one,

850
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,236
or it can be many.

851
01:14:13,858 --> 01:14:16,649
The sanzia devil
child wants children.

852
01:14:17,362 --> 01:14:18,779
It will do anything

853
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:20,822
to spread its word
to the children.

854
01:14:20,823 --> 01:14:22,453
Through the dolls?

855
01:14:23,201 --> 01:14:25,661
I don't know what
course Satan will travel.

856
01:14:25,662 --> 01:14:28,294
All I can do is pray
for their salvation.

857
01:14:41,094 --> 01:14:42,969
You see?

858
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:44,520
It has begun.

859
01:14:44,847 --> 01:14:47,353
There will be no end
to its reign of fear.

860
01:14:55,441 --> 01:14:56,942
It's fear that
keeps them ignorant.

861
01:14:56,943 --> 01:14:58,902
To believe that
malarkey is insanity.

862
01:14:58,903 --> 01:15:00,946
Maybe it is, maybe it is.

863
01:15:00,947 --> 01:15:02,906
I have a husband who
thinks it's insanity,

864
01:15:02,907 --> 01:15:05,450
and I'm inclined
to agree with him,

865
01:15:05,451 --> 01:15:07,160
but I have a daughter at home

866
01:15:07,161 --> 01:15:09,793
who's being controlled
by a fucking doll.

867
01:15:10,498 --> 01:15:12,834
Now, you tell me what
the hell that is.

868
01:15:48,661 --> 01:15:50,211
Jessica?

869
01:15:51,372 --> 01:15:52,922
Are you in there?

870
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,510
Shh.

871
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:41,296
What are you doing in there?

872
01:16:41,297 --> 01:16:42,047
I'm hiding.

873
01:16:42,048 --> 01:16:43,048
Where's Jessica?

874
01:16:43,049 --> 01:16:44,216
They're in their room.

875
01:16:44,217 --> 01:16:45,050
Ma, ya gotta go look.

876
01:16:45,051 --> 01:16:45,926
The doll talks.

877
01:16:45,927 --> 01:16:46,927
I saw it.

878
01:16:46,928 --> 01:16:48,094
It moves and everything.

879
01:16:48,095 --> 01:16:48,929
The door's locked.

880
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:50,595
I need a...

881
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:04,535
Jessica?

882
01:17:11,202 --> 01:17:12,752
Jessie?

883
01:17:57,248 --> 01:17:58,798
Where is she?

884
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,042
What have you done with her?

885
01:18:01,043 --> 01:18:02,961
She's in here with me.

886
01:18:02,962 --> 01:18:04,754
She belongs to me.

887
01:18:04,755 --> 01:18:06,673
You'll never get her back now.

888
01:18:06,674 --> 01:18:08,174
We're together forever!

889
01:18:08,175 --> 01:18:09,634
Ha ha hal

890
01:18:09,635 --> 01:18:11,761
she'll always be mine!

891
01:18:11,762 --> 01:18:13,680
Mommy, mommy, help me!

892
01:18:13,681 --> 01:18:14,472
Help me!

893
01:18:14,473 --> 01:18:15,265
No!

894
01:18:15,266 --> 01:18:16,816
I want my daughter!

895
01:18:26,652 --> 01:18:28,153
Call your father at the factory.

896
01:18:28,154 --> 01:18:30,024
I'm going to get
her out of there.

897
01:19:03,356 --> 01:19:04,689
Mom, it's busy.

898
01:19:04,690 --> 01:19:05,482
I can't get through.

899
01:19:05,483 --> 01:19:06,775
Keep trying.

900
01:19:06,776 --> 01:19:09,112
Jimmy, I want you
to stay downstairs.

901
01:19:09,654 --> 01:19:10,737
Suppose you need me?

902
01:19:10,738 --> 01:19:12,744
Do as I say for once!

903
01:19:40,851 --> 01:19:42,401
Jessica?

904
01:20:07,753 --> 01:20:09,045
Operator?

905
01:20:09,046 --> 01:20:11,256
Uh, emergencia.

906
01:20:11,257 --> 01:20:12,807
Interruption.

907
01:20:13,676 --> 01:20:14,634
No.

908
01:20:14,635 --> 01:20:16,185
Interruption.

909
01:20:17,138 --> 01:20:17,929
What?

910
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:19,097
No.

911
01:20:19,098 --> 01:20:20,979
Never, nevermind.

912
01:21:17,782 --> 01:21:19,742
Oh, sweetheart.

913
01:21:20,409 --> 01:21:22,119
Oh, sweetheart.

914
01:21:23,788 --> 01:21:25,789
Jimmy, get in the car!

915
01:21:25,790 --> 01:21:27,340
Jimmy, where are you?

916
01:21:31,045 --> 01:21:31,836
Oh, goody.

917
01:21:31,837 --> 01:21:34,218
We're going for a ride.

918
01:21:37,301 --> 01:21:38,927
Get out of my way.

919
01:21:38,928 --> 01:21:41,890
Jessica, let's play with mommy.

920
01:21:44,683 --> 01:21:45,767
Hold her down!

921
01:21:45,768 --> 01:21:46,810
Don't let her go!

922
01:21:46,811 --> 01:21:48,361
We'll fix mommy!

923
01:21:50,272 --> 01:21:51,189
Get her!

924
01:21:51,190 --> 01:21:51,981
Get her!

925
01:21:51,982 --> 01:21:53,900
Let's kill her!

926
01:21:53,901 --> 01:21:55,451
I hate you!

927
01:21:55,778 --> 01:21:57,328
Kill her!

928
01:22:05,788 --> 01:22:07,669
Play with this, bitch.

929
01:22:21,345 --> 01:22:22,895
Uhh, uhh.

930
01:22:24,890 --> 01:22:26,440
Mommy.

931
01:22:27,810 --> 01:22:29,360
Mommy.

932
01:23:01,677 --> 01:23:03,717
It's time to play.

933
01:24:41,986 --> 01:24:43,111
Oh, my god.

934
01:24:43,112 --> 01:24:44,654
It's true.

935
01:24:44,655 --> 01:24:46,205
What have I done?

936
01:24:59,670 --> 01:25:01,220
Pull it!

937
01:25:09,346 --> 01:25:11,306
We've got you now!

938
01:25:20,941 --> 01:25:22,491
This is fun!

939
01:25:42,296 --> 01:25:43,846
You!

940
01:25:52,765 --> 01:25:54,675
Ready to go in the mixer?

941
01:26:01,273 --> 01:26:02,690
Help!

942
01:26:02,691 --> 01:26:04,241
Help!

943
01:26:05,444 --> 01:26:06,361
Oh!

944
01:26:06,362 --> 01:26:07,912
You!

945
01:26:09,114 --> 01:26:09,906
Help!

946
01:26:09,907 --> 01:26:10,990
Ready?

947
01:26:10,991 --> 01:26:12,541
No!

948
01:26:15,621 --> 01:26:17,171
Help!

949
01:26:18,332 --> 01:26:19,882
Help!

950
01:26:21,752 --> 01:26:23,336
No!

951
01:26:23,337 --> 01:26:24,887
Help!

952
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:32,136
You want to be next?

953
01:26:32,137 --> 01:26:33,687
Help!

954
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:38,643
Where do you kill the power?

955
01:26:38,644 --> 01:26:40,900
On the wall!

956
01:26:55,828 --> 01:26:57,868
Are you all right?

957
01:26:58,414 --> 01:26:59,872
I got to get home.

958
01:26:59,873 --> 01:27:02,664
There's another
one at the house.

959
01:27:15,722 --> 01:27:16,848
Thank god you're all right.

960
01:27:16,849 --> 01:27:18,399
Elliot,

961
01:27:18,434 --> 01:27:20,394
it was alive.

962
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:22,895
It was alive.

963
01:27:22,896 --> 01:27:23,646
I know.

964
01:27:23,647 --> 01:27:24,981
They're all alive.

965
01:27:24,982 --> 01:27:26,732
How is this happening?

966
01:27:26,733 --> 01:27:28,363
I don't know.

967
01:27:28,735 --> 01:27:30,069
Wow.

968
01:27:30,070 --> 01:27:32,029
Oh, my god. What
are you going to do?

969
01:27:32,030 --> 01:27:33,656
We're going back inside.

970
01:27:33,657 --> 01:27:34,991
Take the kids down the hill.

971
01:27:34,992 --> 01:27:36,033
Elliot, no.

972
01:27:36,034 --> 01:27:37,285
Let's just get out
of here, please.

973
01:27:37,286 --> 01:27:39,078
I don't know how this happened,

974
01:27:39,079 --> 01:27:41,247
but we're going to destroy them.

975
01:27:41,248 --> 01:27:42,540
All of them.

976
01:27:42,541 --> 01:27:43,833
Elliot, we can get
help from someone.

977
01:27:43,834 --> 01:27:45,704
Don't go in there,
please, Elliot!

978
01:27:47,921 --> 01:27:49,672
We don't have
time to run a wire.

979
01:27:49,673 --> 01:27:51,799
The longest fuse is a minute.

980
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,551
Place it and move
on to the next.

981
01:27:53,552 --> 01:27:55,595
We'll line the inside perimeter.

982
01:27:55,596 --> 01:27:56,345
Take the right.

983
01:27:56,346 --> 01:27:57,680
I'll go to the left,

984
01:27:57,681 --> 01:27:58,556
we'll come down the
center to the door.

985
01:27:58,557 --> 01:27:59,348
Perfect.

986
01:27:59,349 --> 01:28:00,224
Can I go?

987
01:28:00,225 --> 01:28:01,517
Can I set one?

988
01:28:01,518 --> 01:28:02,768
No. Jimmy, I want
you down the hill

989
01:28:02,769 --> 01:28:04,020
with your mother.

990
01:28:04,021 --> 01:28:05,813
I don't want you anywhere
near this factory.

991
01:28:05,814 --> 01:28:07,364
Here.

992
01:28:17,618 --> 01:28:19,168
Get down.

993
01:28:21,121 --> 01:28:22,371
Jimmy.

994
01:28:22,372 --> 01:28:23,706
Jimmy!

995
01:28:23,707 --> 01:28:25,417
I'm going to blow up the pit.

996
01:28:34,885 --> 01:28:36,845
Hey, come here!

997
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:44,610
Bastards!

998
01:28:59,868 --> 01:29:00,993
Mom, get back!

999
01:29:00,994 --> 01:29:02,544
The pit's going to blow!

1000
01:29:28,772 --> 01:29:30,322
Huh?

1001
01:30:07,853 --> 01:30:09,483
Honey, it's over.
