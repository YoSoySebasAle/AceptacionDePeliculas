1
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:25,711
What?

2
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,757
A date with a woman in that 
village a long time ago

3
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,095
I was cute

4
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:39,183
Be careful, I think you ’re an insider

5
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,686
Shoot if you shoot

6
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,149
Are you still in the village?

7
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,109
Probably

8
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:31,693
What?  

9
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,528
can not understand

10
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:09,082
Separate the hands and check the tent and truck

11
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:10,459
I watch the surroundings

12
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,503
You're the dead body

13
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,184
All right

14
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:50,017
Who?

15
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:05,741
Are you serious?

16
00:06:11,163 --> 00:06:11,914
To there

17
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:28,263
Sit down

18
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:33,852
This woman?

19
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:43,695
Why in the tent?

20
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:56,834
What is she?

21
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,301
"Don't go down"

22
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:22,025
What is that woman?

23
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,029
The prisoner in the tent

24
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,156
I got my finger cut off

25
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,158
Why don't you kill me

26
00:07:34,371 --> 00:07:35,706
It's a civilian

27
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,629
3 people look around

28
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:45,465
Right now!

29
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:57,895
Clerk

30
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:00,898
What is your mission?

31
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:02,024
stop

32
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,235
What is our mission?  A simple question

33
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:13,660
Kill all the humans in the enemy camp 

34
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,164
Collect the materials

35
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,458
This woman was also in the enemy camp

36
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:23,962
Yeah but she...

37
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,047
Shoot and kill

38
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,679
Pull out the gun and shoot this woman

39
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,488
I feel responsible for my brother's death

40
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,324
But she's irrelevant

41
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,912
Shoot as I was told

42
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,137
Command is absolute

43
00:09:16,849 --> 00:09:18,600
There is someone over there

44
00:09:44,585 --> 00:09:46,295
How many enemies are there?

45
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,424
Apparently there are at most 3-4 people

46
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:54,595
Ask Walker for rescue

47
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:55,971
Roger that

48
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:15,157
It ’s a fierce shootout that calls for rescue right away.

49
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:16,325
This one too

50
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:19,995
It is a strategy change

51
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,997
Gather in a helicopter

52
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,131
Rescue does not come

53
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,382
You're a lie

54
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:08,103
Come on!

55
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:10,063
hurry up!

56
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:57,361
Fucking bastard

57
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,279
We are the same

58
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,615
<The order is absolute>

59
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,350
let's go

60
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:11,351
I'll run away

61
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:14,563
Over here

62
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:17,751
What?

63
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:20,796
Nothing apart

64
00:15:24,049 --> 00:15:26,927
If you have something to say

65
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:32,224
Nothing

66
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:35,686
Really?

67
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:41,191
What did you say

68
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:42,276
To whom?

69
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:43,944
That prisoner woman

70
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,738
Kia spoke

71
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:49,616
What story?

72
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:54,955
"Don't go down"

73
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:56,582
Is it your mama?

74
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:57,457
Stop

75
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:43,378
<Don't go down>

76
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:01,230
Wait, lie

77
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:03,315
There are stairs

78
00:17:04,525 --> 00:17:07,819
Let's go quickly There is quite a lot to the top floor

79
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:20,707
Fine?

80
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,127
I forgot about the past

81
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,258
I can't forget

82
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,011
Don't worry, it's true

83
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:17,491
Is it just me?  It doesn't arrive even if it goes up

84
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:21,662
Are you okay?

85
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,749
I wait here

86
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:28,168
No good

87
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:32,339
I have a bad feeling

88
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:36,176
me too

89
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:50,858
Are you all okay?

90
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,461
Are you all safe?

91
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:39,781
It's settled

92
00:20:40,908 --> 00:20:42,576
Look at someone

93
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:46,872
I go

94
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:51,710
No

95
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:53,962
Calm down

96
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:56,381
Power problems

97
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:54,481
Buxton?

98
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:00,529
Buxton!

99
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:07,536
Shit what?

100
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:08,954
No good

101
00:22:10,998 --> 00:22:11,790
Don't go down

102
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:32,561
Run

103
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:35,522
Go up!

104
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:48,368
Is that no good either?

105
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:49,745
Wireless communication

106
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:51,455
What's happening

107
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:55,083
God's work

108
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:56,919
God is trying

109
00:22:57,878 --> 00:22:59,838
Don't say silly

110
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:01,924
She is right

111
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:05,135
When did you become pious?

112
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,058
Because of my first mission when I was 19 years old

113
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:16,063
If you were escorting the prisoners ---

114
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:20,400
Surrounded by convoys by the rebels

115
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:25,531
I was caught with the prisoners too

116
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,828
It took 5 months to escape

117
00:23:38,961 --> 00:23:41,421
Behind their hideout ––

118
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:45,926
There was a clock tower with a long staircase

119
00:23:53,851 --> 00:23:55,102
They are every day

120
00:23:58,105 --> 00:24:01,525
Everything was scattered on the stairs

121
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,653
Like broken glass or safety pins

122
00:24:05,988 --> 00:24:07,656
We took off our shoes...

123
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:14,997
Walked on it

124
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:20,627
Repeat over and over again

125
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:21,795
All day long

126
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:30,971
I was told that I was a soul judge

127
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:37,186
So no doubt

128
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:40,022
This is punishment

129
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:46,236
What?

130
00:24:47,905 --> 00:24:49,198
Kill the prisoners

131
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,871
Don't talk silly

132
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,499
Thinking about the current situation 

133
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:02,878
There will be danger every few minutes

134
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:04,671
I have to run away

135
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:07,966
First I'll find the exit

136
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:10,135
Don't talk useless

137
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:12,638
that's an order

138
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:16,725
Let's go up

139
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:29,947
I feel like I'm climbing the same stairs all the time

140
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:33,617
Even if you reach the top

141
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:37,538
It looks like I'm back down

142
00:26:04,106 --> 00:26:05,983
There is an exit

143
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:23,250
Hold the gun

144
00:26:23,375 --> 00:26:24,376
With an enemy?

145
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:26,837
Already one person was killed

146
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:47,352
What is this?

147
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:28,977
No way now...

148
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:35,567
Stop it, no

149
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:37,027
impossible

150
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:39,988
That's right

151
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,785
After all it may be punishment

152
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:47,454
I can not do it

153
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:49,623
Go down

154
00:29:49,748 --> 00:29:51,250
Don't say stupid

155
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:57,047
What should I do?

156
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:01,009
I do not understand

157
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,513
But below is dangerous

158
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:06,849
Why do you know it is dangerous?

159
00:30:08,225 --> 00:30:09,268
I feel

160
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:12,145
I'm sorry ---

161
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:15,774
Believe in God better than you

162
00:30:17,818 --> 00:30:19,111
Stop it Ryan

163
00:30:24,283 --> 00:30:26,326
Certainly I swore loyalty

164
00:30:27,494 --> 00:30:29,913
But it ’s not going to hell

165
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:43,797
This song again

166
00:32:45,924 --> 00:32:48,260
My mother sang when I couldn't sleep

167
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:51,638
I can't sleep

168
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:53,682
It's a creepy song

169
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:56,602
what will you do?

170
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:04,985
Let's go up

171
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:08,447
Until when?

172
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,490
eternally?

173
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:16,455
Thought to me

174
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:20,334
Try talking

175
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:25,297
You should run away before that

176
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:30,677
let's go

177
00:33:54,576 --> 00:33:55,202
So what?

178
00:33:56,036 --> 00:33:58,372
I'm just beginning to see

179
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:01,917
Are you going to hell soon?

180
00:34:03,168 --> 00:34:06,380
Ford is noisy

181
00:34:08,924 --> 00:34:11,426
Mostly about prisoners

182
00:34:12,594 --> 00:34:15,514
The date and place of detention are written

183
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:19,726
That woman is from Calcars

184
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:22,396
It seems like I was restrained for a long time

185
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:25,274
aside from that?

186
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:32,697
The instruction "Do not kill her"

187
00:34:36,994 --> 00:34:38,745
Her synonym is also listed

188
00:34:40,205 --> 00:34:41,081
What?

189
00:34:47,713 --> 00:34:49,339
"The Prophet of Death"

190
00:34:50,632 --> 00:34:52,092
Local superstition

191
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:59,933
I think you can understand it without explaining

192
00:35:00,893 --> 00:35:04,855
This situation is obviously related to her death

193
00:35:06,106 --> 00:35:08,025
What?  Kia

194
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:10,402
Is it my fault?

195
00:35:14,865 --> 00:35:15,616
I apologize

196
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:20,120
If you say too much 

197
00:35:21,288 --> 00:35:22,706
I'll kill you

198
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:25,709
Stop Stanton

199
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:28,629
Shut up Garrett

200
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:34,676
Everyone, set the clock

201
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:37,804
Nolan and Walker watch over the door

202
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:40,098
Everything else is reconnaissance

203
00:35:40,224 --> 00:35:40,891
reconnaissance?

204
00:35:44,144 --> 00:35:44,978
Do you get it

205
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,815
Same as usual training

206
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:52,903
It's a situation that doesn't make sense.

207
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:57,366
There's no need to stay on the stairs

208
00:36:00,494 --> 00:36:01,662
Let's find a solution

209
00:36:38,866 --> 00:36:41,535
Ford comes with me

210
00:36:55,591 --> 00:36:56,216
What?  

211
00:36:56,341 --> 00:36:57,009
can not understand

212
00:37:01,555 --> 00:37:03,348
What if you don't come back?

213
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:11,190
Walker?

214
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:13,400
listening?

215
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:25,412
What's wrong?

216
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:31,251
Don't come

217
00:37:32,669 --> 00:37:33,295
Emma

218
00:37:35,297 --> 00:37:36,340
Lower the gun

219
00:37:43,597 --> 00:37:47,601
Please drop the gun early

220
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:53,023
Listen to the story!  Lower the gun

221
00:38:15,754 --> 00:38:16,713
Walker!

222
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:23,887
Come to help

223
00:38:27,516 --> 00:38:28,600
Please

224
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:36,316
Walker!

225
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:37,526
What about Walker?

226
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:39,528
I have to go!

227
00:39:00,799 --> 00:39:01,675
<Don't go down>

228
00:39:43,675 --> 00:39:44,718
Need a strategy

229
00:39:46,428 --> 00:39:48,931
This is different from training

230
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:52,976
I know

231
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:55,270
Really

232
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:57,898
What is it then?

233
00:40:00,901 --> 00:40:03,654
Obviously supernatural power is working

234
00:40:07,074 --> 00:40:12,329
That power seems to want to stop our actions in the past

235
00:40:15,374 --> 00:40:16,583
I want to save the prisoners

236
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:21,880
what will you do?

237
00:40:28,303 --> 00:40:29,221
do nothing

238
00:40:32,182 --> 00:40:32,933
eh?

239
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:35,936
Wait, I don't understand what you mean

240
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,147
do nothing?

241
00:40:40,858 --> 00:40:45,362
I should have decided to die when I took on the mission

242
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:51,410
Once on the battlefield every danger awaits

243
00:40:53,287 --> 00:40:56,707
Will This is not the battlefield

244
00:41:00,252 --> 00:41:01,962
No, it ’s the battlefield

245
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:13,599
My mission was to kill people in 
the enemy camp and collect information

246
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:16,810
Mission completed

247
00:41:18,979 --> 00:41:21,732
If you are destined to die here

248
00:41:23,525 --> 00:41:24,818
That kind of contract

249
00:41:28,822 --> 00:41:31,158
Dan's death was a disaster

250
00:41:32,492 --> 00:41:34,453
But don't drag too much

251
00:41:36,205 --> 00:41:38,081
Your judgment will slow down

252
00:41:42,461 --> 00:41:44,505
My brother's death is my responsibility

253
00:41:46,048 --> 00:41:48,217
Prioritized emotions over missions

254
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:55,182
Either way my brother may have died

255
00:41:59,645 --> 00:42:02,689
But even now, every time I close my eyes

256
00:42:02,814 --> 00:42:05,776
The moment my brother died crosses my head

257
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:09,905
I just regret

258
00:42:12,616 --> 00:42:14,701
Younger brother wasted

259
00:42:16,537 --> 00:42:18,872
For something big

260
00:42:20,707 --> 00:42:24,920
We are disposable pieces anyway

261
00:42:28,507 --> 00:42:31,510
Just follow the instructions

262
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:35,722
I understand your feelings

263
00:42:36,974 --> 00:42:39,726
Can Nolan go first?

264
00:42:39,893 --> 00:42:43,897
I have a leg injury, so it takes time to walk

265
00:42:45,649 --> 00:42:46,233
go

266
00:43:04,251 --> 00:43:05,919
Harris, stop it

267
00:43:07,421 --> 00:43:08,964
I'll kill you

268
00:43:10,424 --> 00:43:11,925
That's probably right

269
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,958
This fucking guy

270
00:44:27,543 --> 00:44:28,836
Wake up

271
00:45:31,064 --> 00:45:32,608
Stop it already

272
00:46:15,108 --> 00:46:16,235
I'll go

273
00:46:18,403 --> 00:46:19,112
Standing

274
00:46:22,908 --> 00:46:23,992
I can't

275
00:46:26,495 --> 00:46:27,162
go

276
00:46:30,082 --> 00:46:32,626
Don't be stupid, stand up

277
00:46:36,463 --> 00:46:37,714
Save the prisoners

278
00:46:43,053 --> 00:46:44,304
Correct the past--

279
00:46:48,267 --> 00:46:49,810
The future should change

280
00:46:54,106 --> 00:46:56,149
No, I can't leave

281
00:47:08,161 --> 00:47:08,829
let's go

282
00:48:27,074 --> 00:48:29,368
Who else has limited legs?

283
00:48:34,623 --> 00:48:37,501
Don't pick your finger within 24 hours

284
00:48:39,795 --> 00:48:41,421
Really angry

285
00:48:42,923 --> 00:48:46,760
It ’s torture as Walker says.

286
00:48:49,429 --> 00:48:52,015
Let me rest a little

287
00:48:59,648 --> 00:49:01,942
I ’ve been out twice

288
00:49:02,067 --> 00:49:04,945
I returned to the same past both times

289
00:49:05,696 --> 00:49:08,740
Do you remember where you were at that time?

290
00:49:12,786 --> 00:49:15,622
I divided myself and watched around

291
00:49:15,747 --> 00:49:17,124
Attack from the left

292
00:49:17,249 --> 00:49:20,252
So run to the right and in front of the tent

293
00:49:20,586 --> 00:49:24,464
How can Clark avoid killing prisoners?

294
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:28,302
Just tell the past about the circumstances

295
00:49:29,761 --> 00:49:33,473
What if a man just like you suddenly appears?

296
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:37,019
I'll kill you

297
00:49:37,644 --> 00:49:38,478
exactly

298
00:49:38,979 --> 00:49:42,399
You don't have to touch yourself in the past

299
00:49:42,691 --> 00:49:47,571
Our ambush fails if we inform the enemy

300
00:49:48,572 --> 00:49:50,657
What if the enemy killed me?

301
00:49:51,325 --> 00:49:52,159
Come on

302
00:49:52,868 --> 00:49:56,663
It ’s like “Back to the Future”

303
00:49:57,206 --> 00:50:00,042
I like the third work

304
00:50:01,418 --> 00:50:02,794
Ignore the present

305
00:50:03,504 --> 00:50:06,882
I can't think of another good strategy

306
00:50:07,257 --> 00:50:11,929
If you scare your enemies, they may escape from there.

307
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:15,349
What are you waiting for?

308
00:50:15,516 --> 00:50:18,185
If nobody is gone, let's go home

309
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:20,103
I think it's impossible

310
00:50:20,354 --> 00:50:25,108
Unbearable for a long time on 
the battlefield without supplies and rescue

311
00:50:26,777 --> 00:50:28,028
Am I left?

312
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:31,240
There are no exceptions for everyone

313
00:51:22,666 --> 00:51:23,333
No

314
00:51:23,584 --> 00:51:25,586
Just drive them away

315
00:51:52,696 --> 00:51:56,366
Separate the hands and check the tent and truck

316
00:51:56,617 --> 00:51:57,868
I watch the surroundings

317
00:51:58,452 --> 00:51:59,828
You're the dead body

318
00:52:21,642 --> 00:52:22,684
Who?

319
00:52:32,819 --> 00:52:33,654
This woman?

320
00:52:44,289 --> 00:52:45,499
What are you doing?

321
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:47,668
I confirmed my finger

322
00:52:47,793 --> 00:52:49,002
Why does my finger return?

323
00:52:49,711 --> 00:52:51,129
Something might have changed

324
00:52:55,551 --> 00:52:56,718
What is that woman?

325
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,138
Nothing has changed

326
00:53:05,644 --> 00:53:06,311
Clerk

327
00:53:08,605 --> 00:53:09,314
What is your mission?

328
00:53:09,731 --> 00:53:10,440
stop

329
00:53:11,233 --> 00:53:13,652
What is our mission?  A simple question

330
00:53:16,864 --> 00:53:17,865
It's time already

331
00:53:18,407 --> 00:53:19,533
What is your strategy?

332
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,034
Not particularly

333
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:23,912
Shoot Stanton?

334
00:53:26,415 --> 00:53:29,042
No, all will survive

335
00:53:31,879 --> 00:53:33,672
Is that possible?

336
00:53:41,305 --> 00:53:43,348
Command is absolute

337
00:53:44,016 --> 00:53:45,225
I have to go back to the door

338
00:53:45,392 --> 00:53:47,728
If you start running, you will be shot

339
00:53:47,895 --> 00:53:49,396
But I have to go

340
00:53:50,522 --> 00:53:52,274
Shoot the ground only once

341
00:53:53,775 --> 00:53:55,485
Someone is over there

342
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:16,006
go

343
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:53,043
My legs are dangerous

344
00:54:53,418 --> 00:54:55,754
I'm worse

345
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:01,134
I'll try again

346
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:06,974
Now let's go back and help the prisoners

347
00:55:08,225 --> 00:55:13,230
There is time between when an enemy soldier gets up and when he attacks

348
00:55:13,355 --> 00:55:17,985
Let's enter a tent while attracting with a gunshot

349
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:18,944
I

350
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:24,992
Nolan is impossible, and two people 
lack in preparation and training

351
00:55:25,158 --> 00:55:27,119
Shut up and leave it to me

352
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,589
What if I can't make it?

353
00:55:39,006 --> 00:55:39,673
That's right

354
00:55:41,884 --> 00:55:43,510
Wait until you return

355
00:57:10,305 --> 00:57:10,889
now

356
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,526
My back was shot

357
00:58:05,444 --> 00:58:06,653
May breathe

358
00:58:42,272 --> 00:58:43,357
<All right>

359
00:58:53,992 --> 00:58:55,035
What is that woman?

360
00:58:55,369 --> 00:58:57,704
The prisoner in the tent

361
00:58:57,871 --> 00:58:59,540
I got my finger cut off

362
00:58:59,706 --> 00:59:01,083
Why don't you kill me

363
00:59:01,542 --> 00:59:02,334
What is your strategy?

364
00:59:02,459 --> 00:59:03,293
Same as before

365
00:59:03,418 --> 00:59:07,256
Help Ford after driving away with a gun

366
00:59:12,553 --> 00:59:14,596
Command is absolute

367
00:59:17,307 --> 00:59:19,017
There is someone over there

368
00:59:23,188 --> 00:59:24,231
stop it

369
00:59:24,731 --> 00:59:28,318
Nolan and the two of us go back together

370
00:59:34,241 --> 00:59:36,034
How many enemies are there?

371
00:59:36,243 --> 00:59:40,038
Apparently there are at most 3-4 people

372
01:00:01,602 --> 01:00:03,228
Ford standing

373
01:00:03,353 --> 01:00:04,146
Look!

374
01:00:05,647 --> 01:00:06,565
I'll go

375
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:15,866
How about two people?

376
01:00:17,618 --> 01:00:19,119
hurry up!  let's go

377
01:01:02,329 --> 01:01:04,998
Die if you don't pick up bullets

378
01:01:24,852 --> 01:01:26,103
I have to stop bleeding

379
01:01:31,191 --> 01:01:32,609
Bite this

380
01:01:34,862 --> 01:01:35,696
Believe

381
01:02:23,076 --> 01:02:24,077
sorry

382
01:02:29,917 --> 01:02:30,918
Hang in there

383
01:02:46,934 --> 01:02:47,684
finished

384
01:02:56,568 --> 01:03:00,280
I won't hold it for a long time unless I see a doctor

385
01:03:08,455 --> 01:03:09,581
What is your strategy?

386
01:03:12,626 --> 01:03:13,418
There

387
01:03:19,091 --> 01:03:21,718
Ford firmly

388
01:03:21,885 --> 01:03:23,971
Otherwise I'll die

389
01:03:25,222 --> 01:03:28,308
This strategy does not work

390
01:03:28,433 --> 01:03:29,393
shut up

391
01:03:29,601 --> 01:03:32,479
He's right

392
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,190
Then, another good idea?

393
01:03:38,068 --> 01:03:40,320
If you reach the helicopter

394
01:03:40,487 --> 01:03:43,907
Escape from here and help Ford

395
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:49,663
If we die on the battlefield in the past, we will disappear

396
01:04:24,364 --> 01:04:25,199
No abnormalities

397
01:04:29,536 --> 01:04:30,495
Fine?

398
01:04:42,549 --> 01:04:43,717
Pitiful guys

399
01:06:18,645 --> 01:06:20,063
Let's stop him

400
01:06:21,356 --> 01:06:22,774
Still not possible now

401
01:06:23,108 --> 01:06:23,984
<The order is absolute>

402
01:07:02,356 --> 01:07:03,440
Which one?

403
01:07:46,817 --> 01:07:50,028
I'm back again

404
01:08:10,465 --> 01:08:12,217
Thought to fail

405
01:09:00,515 --> 01:09:02,184
Noisy!

406
01:09:04,144 --> 01:09:05,895
stop!  Are you listening?

407
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:07,689
Damn it!

408
01:09:21,078 --> 01:09:21,953
Let's move

409
01:09:49,147 --> 01:09:50,899
I'll regret it if I take it off

410
01:09:51,649 --> 01:09:52,276
Right

411
01:09:54,528 --> 01:09:55,696
But I'll take it off

412
01:10:05,205 --> 01:10:07,457
Now try a different method

413
01:10:39,573 --> 01:10:40,282
<What?  〉

414
01:10:40,407 --> 01:10:41,241
<can not understand>

415
01:11:09,061 --> 01:11:10,354
What is that woman?

416
01:11:11,104 --> 01:11:13,357
The prisoner in the tent

417
01:11:13,565 --> 01:11:15,484
I got my finger cut off

418
01:11:19,530 --> 01:11:20,447
Nolan?

419
01:11:23,325 --> 01:11:25,285
Two people look around

420
01:11:27,371 --> 01:11:28,121
Right now!

421
01:11:33,544 --> 01:11:35,712
Pull out the gun and shoot this woman

422
01:11:45,472 --> 01:11:48,141
Shoot as I was told

423
01:11:54,857 --> 01:11:58,151
I've besieged, release the prisoners

424
01:12:04,157 --> 01:12:05,826
You can negotiate with this

425
01:12:08,161 --> 01:12:09,872
Who are you?

426
01:12:10,455 --> 01:12:14,126
If you don't release the prisoners, you'll kill all

427
01:12:17,671 --> 01:12:20,090
It ’s a lie to be surrounded

428
01:12:24,386 --> 01:12:26,680
If it ’s true, I ’m already dead

429
01:12:32,769 --> 01:12:33,437
Do you get it

430
01:12:35,397 --> 01:12:36,982
So what is your request

431
01:12:37,649 --> 01:12:40,485
Release the prisoners and leave

432
01:12:41,028 --> 01:12:42,446
Then don't kill

433
01:12:46,366 --> 01:12:47,409
Unfortunately...

434
01:12:50,037 --> 01:12:51,205
Command is absolute

435
01:13:11,725 --> 01:13:12,643
Quickly

436
01:13:45,801 --> 01:13:48,262
I don't know how long I will hold

437
01:13:49,930 --> 01:13:51,223
Good luck

438
01:13:57,771 --> 01:13:58,647
For what?

439
01:14:01,608 --> 01:14:02,901
To challenge

440
01:14:08,532 --> 01:14:10,450
The prisoners were destined to die

441
01:14:12,619 --> 01:14:14,746
I'm sure we too

442
01:14:17,124 --> 01:14:18,000
It's the worst

443
01:14:18,834 --> 01:14:21,211
Maybe already dead

444
01:14:24,631 --> 01:14:27,634
You must have thought about it once

445
01:14:31,638 --> 01:14:34,349
I said Walker was torture...

446
01:14:39,688 --> 01:14:41,148
Here is hell

447
01:15:01,335 --> 01:15:01,919
<What?  〉

448
01:15:02,044 --> 01:15:02,753
<can not understand>

449
01:15:24,191 --> 01:15:25,901
Someone is over there

450
01:16:01,728 --> 01:16:03,272
Why don't you kill me

451
01:16:03,438 --> 01:16:04,731
It's a civilian

452
01:16:12,948 --> 01:16:14,408
I'll stop

453
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:21,039
I can't stop it

454
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:24,251
Is that so?

455
01:16:28,964 --> 01:16:30,257
Two people go

456
01:16:38,932 --> 01:16:42,728
You can get out of here if you save the prisoners

457
01:16:46,607 --> 01:16:48,358
This hell never ends

458
01:16:51,111 --> 01:16:52,237
Absolutely

459
01:16:54,781 --> 01:16:56,074
I'll finish

460
01:17:17,930 --> 01:17:18,931
Where did you do it?

461
01:17:25,187 --> 01:17:27,105
I was in the enemy

462
01:17:29,441 --> 01:17:30,484
I brought it

463
01:17:34,321 --> 01:17:36,073
Now i know why

464
01:19:05,746 --> 01:19:07,372
Nolan may be right

465
01:19:10,375 --> 01:19:11,585
I won't die

466
01:19:41,865 --> 01:19:43,450
The worst strategy

467
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:49,581
Right

468
01:19:54,795 --> 01:19:57,130
I'm sure there is another way

469
01:20:03,595 --> 01:20:04,471
forget

470
01:20:27,077 --> 01:20:28,453
To the container

471
01:20:30,289 --> 01:20:31,999
Save them if possible

472
01:20:32,875 --> 01:20:34,877
Join the helicopter

473
01:20:35,669 --> 01:20:39,089
It ’s going to be a battle

474
01:20:40,299 --> 01:20:42,384
I want to help as many people as possible

475
01:21:30,057 --> 01:21:31,266
What is that woman?

476
01:21:37,397 --> 01:21:39,608
Pull out the gun and shoot this woman

477
01:21:54,039 --> 01:21:56,583
Shoot as I was told

478
01:21:59,086 --> 01:22:00,754
Someone is over there

479
01:22:19,481 --> 01:22:20,607
What are the materials?

480
01:22:22,067 --> 01:22:22,943
Is that all?

481
01:22:23,277 --> 01:22:24,319
I don't know

482
01:22:25,696 --> 01:22:27,281
Kill all the enemies

483
01:23:29,426 --> 01:23:30,469
<Fine>

484
01:23:31,011 --> 01:23:32,012
<I will help>

485
01:23:32,471 --> 01:23:33,263
<Standing>

486
01:23:35,516 --> 01:23:36,433
<Firmly>

487
01:24:04,378 --> 01:24:05,379
what are you doing?

488
01:24:12,886 --> 01:24:13,887
Lower the gun

489
01:24:16,598 --> 01:24:19,226
First aid and return to duty

490
01:24:21,311 --> 01:24:25,232
The important thing is to act correctly 
rather than command

491
01:24:26,233 --> 01:24:27,276
Now i know

492
01:24:29,653 --> 01:24:31,071
It will be the worst ending

493
01:24:32,281 --> 01:24:33,782
Doesn't work

494
01:24:47,087 --> 01:24:48,463
Do not remove

495
01:24:52,092 --> 01:24:53,010
I won't remove it

496
01:25:25,667 --> 01:25:26,585
Come with me

497
01:25:27,461 --> 01:25:28,128
Good?

498
01:25:43,393 --> 01:25:44,561
It is a strategy change

499
01:25:44,686 --> 01:25:46,563
Gather in a helicopter

500
01:26:06,333 --> 01:26:08,126
<The order is absolute>

501
01:26:19,847 --> 01:26:20,806
It's all right now

502
01:26:22,933 --> 01:26:23,851
Do not worry

503
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:26,019
Should be fine

504
01:27:02,723 --> 01:27:03,849
Who are you

505
01:27:04,057 --> 01:27:06,059
"Save the civilian" command

506
01:27:06,185 --> 01:27:07,895
It's not a taxi

507
01:27:08,103 --> 01:27:09,605
Begging because it's okay

508
01:27:10,272 --> 01:27:12,482
There are others, wait a moment

509
01:27:12,858 --> 01:27:14,401
Wait only 2 minutes

510
01:27:19,907 --> 01:27:21,074
It was safe

511
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:22,534
Can I rent a car?

512
01:27:22,659 --> 01:27:23,827
Do whatever you want

513
01:27:39,092 --> 01:27:40,135
lost sight of

514
01:27:42,763 --> 01:27:44,223
What about Stanton?

515
01:27:44,765 --> 01:27:47,351
I'm dead

516
01:27:47,768 --> 01:27:49,478
Why is that woman?

517
01:27:50,312 --> 01:27:54,608
New order, take her with you

518
01:27:54,733 --> 01:27:55,943
Watch your fingers

519
01:27:56,109 --> 01:27:57,861
what are you doing?  Let's go early

520
01:28:13,001 --> 01:28:14,711
Kia what are you doing

521
01:28:15,712 --> 01:28:16,505
go

522
01:28:16,797 --> 01:28:18,298
You heard?  go

523
01:28:54,293 --> 01:28:55,460
The traitor!

524
01:29:03,302 --> 01:29:04,011
Kia

525
01:29:05,470 --> 01:29:07,347
You are expelled from the unit

526
01:30:58,458 --> 01:31:00,210
Why such a manet?

527
01:31:04,047 --> 01:31:05,674
The instruction was wrong

528
01:31:12,347 --> 01:31:13,724
Keep silent

529
01:31:21,315 --> 01:31:24,651
Stanton!  This fucking guy

530
01:33:05,252 --> 01:33:06,211
Quickly

531
01:33:06,879 --> 01:33:08,422
Where are you?

532
01:33:15,179 --> 01:33:16,388
Radio returned

533
01:33:25,647 --> 01:33:27,191
Is the civilian safe?

534
01:33:27,316 --> 01:33:29,401
Everyone is on a helicopter

535
01:33:33,238 --> 01:33:34,448
Go already

536
01:33:39,286 --> 01:33:40,370
I can't go

537
01:33:44,041 --> 01:33:45,751
Back to help

538
01:33:47,628 --> 01:33:48,670
No

539
01:33:51,381 --> 01:33:52,257
go

540
01:33:53,842 --> 01:33:54,968
Command

541
01:33:56,178 --> 01:33:58,138
Okay, good luck

542
01:35:14,089 --> 01:35:15,674
Did you correct the mistake?

543
01:35:19,887 --> 01:35:20,721
Yeah

544
01:35:27,561 --> 01:35:29,605
If there is a way to stop the battle...

545
01:35:36,737 --> 01:35:38,363
The battle never ends

546
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:47,372
So be

547
01:35:56,924 --> 01:35:58,091
Very cold

548
01:35:59,885 --> 01:36:00,594
Right

549
01:36:06,266 --> 01:36:09,186
Do you remember the song that mom sang?

550
01:36:14,441 --> 01:36:16,068
I was saved by that song

551
01:38:08,889 --> 01:38:10,933
What is the headquarters?

552
01:38:16,021 --> 01:38:17,105
Speak honestly

553
01:38:18,607 --> 01:38:21,735
Stanton shot Clark

554
01:38:22,069 --> 01:38:24,446
I unavoidably shot him

555
01:38:27,699 --> 01:38:32,120
No materials found, rescued civilian POW

556
01:39:10,284 --> 01:39:12,286
Wait, lie

557
01:39:13,078 --> 01:39:14,872
There are stairs

558
01:39:15,914 --> 01:39:18,792
Let's go quickly There is quite 
a lot to the top floor
