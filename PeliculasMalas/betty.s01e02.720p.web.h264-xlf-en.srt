1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:03,086
You know the new word of mouth
is the internet, right?

2
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:08,008
Camille,
let me get that backpack.

3
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:09,718
‐All my shit's in there.
‐Uh...

4
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:11,136
I think I forgot it at the park.

5
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:13,847
‐Look, look, look.
‐Let's go catch that bitch.

6
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:15,390
And then once we catch them,

7
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:17,476
you can get us into Winter Bowl,
deal?

8
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:20,145
‐Fine. Come on, let's go.
‐Yeah, okay. Let's go around.

9
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:23,023
‐Yo, Farouk, who is that?
‐That's Indigo.

10
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:24,983
‐You know Indigo, right?
‐I'm about to.

11
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:28,237
‐ I'm gonna push you.
‐ Okay. Oh, shit!

12
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:33,992
We're good.

13
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,912
Oh, you have a key. That's cool.
Is it yours?

14
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:38,872
Yeah, she's cool.
She can come in.

15
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:41,625
All right. You're good to go.
Skrrt.

16
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,585
‐Camille?
‐What am I supposed to do?

17
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:47,631
Damn, that bitch is cold.

18
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,418
All right.

19
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,044
If you have anything else
you need washed,

20
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:28,171
speak up;
I'm only doing one more load.

21
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:30,882
‐ I do my own laundry, remember?

22
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:33,385
‐ Well, you ready
to pay your own rent too?

23
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,054
‐ No.
That's why I'm still here.

24
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:39,057
‐ What's up with you two?
‐ What is in this thing?

25
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:40,726
‐ What are you doing?
I told you

26
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,561
I don't want people in my stuff.

27
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,521
‐ Oh, so now I'm "people."

28
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:45,772
When I made you
that grilled cheese

29
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,899
this morning, I was "Dad."

30
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:49,568
‐ Elizabeth, where you off to?

31
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,362
‐ Nowhere.
I'm just going out.

32
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:53,405
‐ Take this with you.

33
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,282
‐ I'm vegetarian, Grandma.

34
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,700
‐ No, you not.

35
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,077
‐ I knew a vegetarian once.

36
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,829
She die.

37
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:04,124
I want a big smile.

38
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:08,211
A bigger one.
A louder one.

39
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,131
Bye.

40
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,136
‐ Bro, you fucking
violated that guy.

41
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,931
‐ I just scared him
a little bit.

42
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,141
‐ It's okay.
What's a grown‐ass man doing

43
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:06,144
eating a ice cream cone,
anyways?

44
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,814
‐ Everyone eats ice cream, Kirt.

45
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,565
‐ True.
Whatever.

46
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:11,817
Can we get away

47
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,860
from these bum‐ass tourists,
though?

48
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,696
‐ Mm, let's just stay here.

49
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,864
I don't feel like having

50
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:19,991
a bunch of thirsty‐ass
skater dudes

51
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,326
looking at me.

52
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,620
‐ Would you rather it be
thirsty‐ass skater dudes

53
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,372
or thirsty‐ass that guy?

54
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,999
‐ The cat is so cute, though!

55
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,668
‐ Nah, that shit is cute, bro.

56
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:33,004
‐ It's mad cute.

57
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,863
‐ In case of emergency,

58
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,656
listen for announcements
and instructions

59
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,949
from the bridge.

60
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,325
Please familiarize yourself

61
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,202
with the location
of life jackets on this‐‐

62
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,217
‐ So, Janay,

63
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:20,552
you had a crazy morning.

64
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,053
‐ Damn right, Donald.
‐ Tell us about it.

65
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,054
Please, tell us about it.
‐ I did.

66
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,724
I'm back with my experience.
‐ Okay.

67
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,392
‐ W‐where do I even start?

68
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:28,769
Like...
‐ At the beginning, girl.

69
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:32,606
‐ I ended up on a tour
in my own neighborhood

70
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,108
with a gang
of Japanese hipsters...

71
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,068
‐ Oh, no.
‐ And white people in shorts.

72
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:39,070
We were on what they call

73
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,572
the "Brooklyn...

74
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,282
Edge Graffiti Experience."

75
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,117
‐ Tell us about your experience.

76
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,078
‐ I'ma tell you.
So for 20 minutes,

77
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,748
right, we stared at a mural

78
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,416
depicting Biggie Smalls'
final day,

79
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,751
which, according...
‐ Okay.

80
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,419
‐ To our tour guide, Josh,

81
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,755
was..."raw."

82
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,131
It's so visceral.

83
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,257
It was shit.
‐ Yeah.

84
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:00,258
‐ Right?
And then also‐‐

85
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,135
hold on, hold on‐‐ our last stop

86
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,805
was this Caribbean spot
that I used to go to...

87
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,807
‐ Yeah, yeah, uh‐huh, uh‐huh.
‐ All the time with my dad.

88
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:07,933
You remember that spot, right?
‐ Yeah, I do.

89
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:11,311
‐ Now it's a new,
authentic bistro.

90
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,271
‐ New and authentic?

91
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,941
‐ How cool is that?
‐ Authentic sounds delicious.

92
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,025
I can't lie.

93
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,443
‐ Not delicious enough

94
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,945
to erase an entire neighborhood.

95
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,947
‐ Well‐‐ ‐ You've gone too far

96
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:25,242
when you put picture frames
around bullet holes,

97
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,785
which this spot had.

98
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:27,786
Ah!

99
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,371
‐ No, it's new and authentic!

100
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,456
It's new and authentic!
‐ No, stop!

101
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:35,168
I need to ask you all
a question at home real quick.

102
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:36,211
Why is it

103
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,630
that you hate graffiti
in your neighborhoods

104
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,298
but will pay good money
to see it

105
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,884
and look at it in mine?

106
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,178
‐ Please answer that question.

107
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,721
‐ Need to know.

108
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,895
Are the comments disabled?

109
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,107
‐ Um...
‐ I'm trying to...

110
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,149
‐ Yes.

111
00:05:58,233 --> 00:05:59,401
‐ Why?

112
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,820
‐ Um... a couple trolls

113
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,321
just crawled out
from under they bridges,

114
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,699
and I just‐‐ I just cut it off.

115
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,242
I just cut 'em off.

116
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,202
‐ Every video has trolls.
That doesn't mean you just...

117
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:11,621
‐ I know that.
‐ Go and turn the comments off

118
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:12,998
because a few fools
are talking shit.

119
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,291
‐ I know.

120
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,835
I‐‐they were‐‐but they
were, like, talking mad shit.

121
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,461
Like, it was unnecessary.
‐ So what?

122
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,505
It doesn't even matter,
because our comments

123
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:23,008
equals engagement
equals our views.

124
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,384
‐ Okay, yes, I know,
but they were talking

125
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,343
mad shit about you.

126
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:26,511
‐ So?

127
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,263
‐ Look, just let me
keep them off

128
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,931
until it, like,
dies down a little bit,

129
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,391
and then that's that.

130
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,728
I can't help but be
a little bit protective of you.

131
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,062
I'm sorry.

132
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,856
‐ I don't need you
to protect me.

133
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,899
‐ I know‐‐ ‐ You're not my dad.

134
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,319
‐ I know I'm not your dad.
Okay?

135
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:46,781
I... but I am more
like your twin brother, so...

136
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,704
‐ You know, sometimes

137
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,373
I wish you were my actual twin.

138
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:56,916
‐ That is precious, Janay.

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,210
That is the sweetest thing
you've ever said to me.

140
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,463
‐ 'Cause then I would've just
eaten you in the womb.

141
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,881
‐ And that is so dark.

142
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,258
‐ And then the comments
would be on...

143
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,594
‐ That is just dire.

144
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,482
‐ Oh, come on!

145
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,071
‐ I'm already over it.

146
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,364
‐ Yo, it's fine!

147
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,866
It's gonna be fine.
Yo, it's gonna be mad fun.

148
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,371
‐ You still mad
about the Winter Bowl thing?

149
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,250
Guess so!

150
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:40,752
‐ Yo, she's mad annoying.

151
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,170
We looked for her bag all day,

152
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,256
and she just went to go chill
with those fuckboys.

153
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,217
Come on, I'ma teach you
how to go down this ramp.

154
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,135
‐ What?

155
00:07:53,056 --> 00:07:54,140
‐ Is that Bambi's new video?

156
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,433
‐ Yo, Milton does
the sickest wallrides

157
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,476
right here.

158
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,144
‐ Yo, homey gives zero fucks.
‐ Yo, is that

159
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,604
Bambi's new video?

160
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,232
‐ Yo, Mike.
I'm right here, bro.

161
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:11,324
‐ Eww, Charlie,
what's on your shirt?

162
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,159
You always fall for it
every single‐‐

163
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:15,120
‐ Hardies.
‐ You gonna hit me?

164
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,413
‐ Can't violate you right now.

165
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,123
‐ 'Cause I'm a girl?

166
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,166
‐ No, 'cause I fucked up
my hand yesterday.

167
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:23,128
‐ Man...

168
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,975
‐ Yo, guys, this bracelet
right here,

169
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,477
this girl in Utah,
she gave it to me.

170
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:40,937
She was mad different, yo.

171
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,272
After she gave it to me,

172
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,523
she jumped into the hot tub
at the gym...

173
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:44,941
‐ "She jumped into
the hot tub at the gym..."

174
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,317
‐ with all her clothes on.
‐ "With all her clothes on."

175
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,652
‐ Even her shoes?

176
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:49,612
‐ Yes.
‐ Yes.

177
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:50,989
‐ Okay.
‐ Okay.

178
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,323
‐ I know what you doing.

179
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,325
‐ I know what you doing.

180
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:55,493
‐ 'Sup, boys?

181
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,162
‐ Yo!
‐ Oh, shit!

182
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,204
‐ Speak of the devil.

183
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,664
‐ Ka‐shh!

184
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:01,041
‐ You know me, bro.

185
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,333
‐ Yeah, baby, tag it.

186
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,174
Everything!

187
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,346
‐ I bet you won't do this.
‐ Bet you won't do this.

188
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,518
Yo!

189
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:23,188
‐ Hi, Camille.

190
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,857
‐ Hey.
What's up?

191
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,526
‐ Yo, you guys want
to play S‐K‐A‐T‐E?

192
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,195
‐ No.
‐ No, come on!

193
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,529
It's H‐O‐R‐S‐E‐‐
it's like H‐O‐R‐S‐E,

194
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:32,864
but it's S‐K‐A‐T‐E.

195
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,533
Okay, here.
You can hold on to me.

196
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,662
‐ Ah‐‐ ‐ Yeah!

197
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,500
Nice!
‐ Fuck, yeah.

198
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,210
‐ Mm‐hmm!

199
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,137
‐ Ah!
Ugh.

200
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:41,724
‐ Hey.

201
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,982
‐ You know those Betties,
don't you?

202
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,903
‐ No, not really.

203
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:59,159
I saw your last video,

204
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:01,661
and I was just wondering,

205
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,621
do you, like, hear a song

206
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,124
and then you just know that
that's a song for the clip,

207
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,458
or do you cut up the clip first,

208
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,420
and then lay a song over it?

209
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,754
‐ Depends.
I mean, sometimes

210
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,131
there's something
that I've been wanting to use

211
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,799
or something that, like, I like,

212
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,134
or something I liked
when I was a kid,

213
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,761
and... you know,
if it fits, it fits.

214
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,263
Editing is important, too.

215
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,598
‐ Yeah!

216
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,808
Yo, I love when, um,

217
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,143
like, someone lands,

218
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,187
and the beat goes with it.

219
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,646
I don't know.
‐ Yeah.

220
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,315
‐ I think that's cool.

221
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,482
But I've been watching
your videos

222
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,484
since I started skating.

223
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,486
‐ So, like, six months ago?

224
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,071
‐ No.

225
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,657
I been skating
for, like, ten years.

226
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,201
I...

227
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,454
What?

228
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,414
‐ I know.

229
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,999
I've been watching.

230
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,168
You're good.

231
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,961
‐ Thank you.

232
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,716
Let me get a cigarette.

233
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,138
Wait, but...

234
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,140
my finger might touch
the other ones.

235
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,516
Is that okay?

236
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,518
Like, you're gonna put
your mouth‐‐I didn't want...

237
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,229
you know, your mouth to touch...

238
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,772
Thank you.

239
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,527
‐ You look perfect.

240
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,655
Can you lean back
a little bit, though?

241
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,660
Stand up straight.

242
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,620
Yeah.

243
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,916
Can you do one with your hair
just all behind you?

244
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,920
Perfect.

245
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,965
Ah, you look great.

246
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,550
Ah, that's perfect.
‐ What the fuck?

247
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:40,760
‐ Oh, yes.

248
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,054
‐ Why are you taking
her picture?

249
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,431
‐ I'm casting
for a national campaign,

250
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:48,351
and I'm looking for skaters,
and she would be perfect.

251
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,896
‐ "Tovah O'Malley Casting."

252
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,231
‐ That's me.

253
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,399
‐ Okay, cool.

254
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,067
Well, my name is Janay,

255
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,110
and this is Kirt.

256
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,237
‐ Yo, I'll do it,
but I can't wear dresses!

257
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,280
I gotta stay firm on that.

258
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:02,740
‐ Okay.

259
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,410
You guys are so cute.
I'm good for today.

260
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,911
Maybe sometime in the future.

261
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,621
But you, call me, okay?

262
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,665
You have my number.
Bye.

263
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,251
‐ Did that really just happen?

264
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,086
Did you really just get scouted

265
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,755
your first day
at the skate park?

266
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,049
‐ I don't know.
It's weird.

267
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,260
‐ This shit seems legit, bro.

268
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,470
‐ Yeah, but I'm not gonna do it.

269
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,181
‐ So then why did you let her
take your picture?

270
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,977
‐ I'm vain.

271
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,231
Okay.

272
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,455
‐ Damn!

273
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,540
Yo, she just wild out.

274
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,251
‐ That's disgusting.

275
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,627
‐ That was some impressive shit.

276
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:57,962
No pun intended.

277
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,590
‐ Literally!
‐ What?

278
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:02,842
‐ I'm referring to the fact

279
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,260
that you just rolled
through poo‐poo.

280
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,598
‐ Oh!
‐ Damn!

281
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,724
‐ Fuck!

282
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,311
‐ Yo, I got you.
Come with me.

283
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,480
‐ Bambi, go help her
clean that shit up.

284
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,900
Yo, chill!
Chill!

285
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,032
‐ Hey, I watched your show.
I liked it.

286
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,867
‐ Oh, thanks, thanks!
‐ Nice job.

287
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,369
‐ Yeah, I love doing it.
It's so fun.

288
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:31,662
I have, like, a bunch of ideas,

289
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,331
like, running through my head
all the time.

290
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:34,290
It's like, you know those people

291
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,333
who get married on Reddit?

292
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,834
Like, I wanna do one about them.

293
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,961
Or, like, you know how sometimes

294
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,838
you feel bad for your socks

295
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,882
when you don't wear them
for a while?

296
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,926
‐ Yes, do that one.

297
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,471
Um, can I ask you a question?

298
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,681
But don't take offense.

299
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,850
‐ Okay.

300
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:57,063
‐ Well, how close are you
with Donald?

301
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,232
‐ Real‐‐we're
really good friends.

302
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,025
First boyfriend.

303
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:03,569
Known him pretty much
my whole life.

304
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:04,904
Why?

305
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:06,405
‐ How do you deal
with all the negative comments

306
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:07,365
and stuff?

307
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,742
‐ Oh, yeah.
Donald had said

308
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,410
that there was some riff‐raff
about that,

309
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:12,662
but he handled it.

310
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,666
‐ Well...

311
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,295
I took a screenshot.

312
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,390
‐ What the fuck?

313
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,641
‐ I'm sorry.

314
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:38,271
‐ That's why he turned off
the fucking comments.

315
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,441
I gotta go.

316
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,235
‐ Wait, can I have my phone?

317
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,444
‐ Yeah, sorry.

318
00:15:45,528 --> 00:15:48,781
Um, can you just keep this
to yourself?

319
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,783
‐ Yeah, of course.
You okay?

320
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,285
‐ Yeah, I'm fine.

321
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,454
‐ Yo, Honeybear!

322
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,248
Yo, this is, um‐‐

323
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,958
What's your name again?
‐ Ash.

324
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,501
‐ This is Ash!

325
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,962
Yo, good news.
She is gay.

326
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,464
She is!

327
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,387
It's okay.
She's just shy.

328
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,479
‐ Dig it!
‐ What up?

329
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,785
‐ Are you fucking serious?

330
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:36,996
‐ Yo, I'm sorry.
‐ The fuck is your problem?

331
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,290
‐ I'm sorry!
‐ Yo, back the fuck off, bro.

332
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,125
She said sorry.
‐ You back the fuck up.

333
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:42,835
The problem's with her, not you.

334
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,128
‐ Calm the fuck down.

335
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,963
Don't tell me that shit,
shrimp dick.

336
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,965
The fuck did you just say?

337
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:51,427
‐ I said you got a shrimp dick!
Shrimp dick!

338
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,596
‐ Okay, if you weren't
a fucking female,

339
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,181
I swear to God...
Oh, my God.

340
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,641
‐ If I wasn't‐‐wah, wah, wah.
What's up?

341
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,100
‐ All right, all right,
all right.

342
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,519
‐ You hear this bitch?
‐ We're gonna have to get

343
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:01,187
some backup, yo.
Like, this chick's

344
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,480
about to fuck up Luis!

345
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:03,981
‐ Yo, fuck you guys.
You're all pussies!

346
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,150
Oh, what?

347
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,319
‐ Get the fuck out of here!
Get the fuck out of here!

348
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,445
‐ Yeah, push me!

349
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,780
‐ Get the fuck off me, bro!

350
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,825
‐ Fuck you guys.
You're all pussies!

351
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,494
You're all pussies.
‐ Get the fuck out of here.

352
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,871
‐ Yo!
‐ Indigo, where are you going?

353
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:21,123
‐ I'm going home, Kirt.

354
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:26,003
‐ Don't let that guy
run you off.

355
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,214
‐ You said Zen.

356
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,966
This was not Zen,

357
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,969
and I don't want no part
of that hostile bullshit.

358
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,512
Keep the board.
I'm done.

359
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,724
‐ Damn, that kind of sucked.

360
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,351
‐ Yeah.

361
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,686
‐ Hey, how come you ran away

362
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,980
from that girl
you liked earlier?

363
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,982
‐ I don't like her.

364
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,858
‐ Really?
'Cause it seems like you do.

365
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,569
‐ I don't like her.

366
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,534
‐ You too?

367
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,412
Man, I hate
when this shit happens.

368
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,878
‐ Hey!
I need to talk to you.

369
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:08,879
‐ What?
Whoa, watch out.

370
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,047
‐ Right now.
‐ Why?

371
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,424
‐ Right now!
‐ Okay, okay.

372
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,051
Yo, I'll be right back.
What's up?

373
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:15,720
‐ Bro, what the fuck?
‐ What?

374
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,054
‐ You said that you
turned off the comments

375
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:18,598
because people
were talking about me,

376
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:19,599
but that's not it.
You lied.

377
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,225
‐ Fuck!

378
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,893
‐ Why would you lie?
‐ Yes, I lie‐‐okay.

379
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:23,894
Fuck.
Jeez.

380
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:25,521
I lied.
I lied.

381
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:29,025
I said that.
I don't...

382
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,943
I don't‐‐fuck.
I just have so much shit

383
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,862
coming at me from all sides
right now, Janay.

384
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,031
I just really don't need it
from you, too, okay?

385
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,074
‐ What the hell is going on?

386
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,704
Fuck.

387
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,332
‐ Can you please just
talk to me?

388
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,929
‐ I can't, man.
I fucking can't.

389
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:00,514
I'm like‐‐I'm just really afraid

390
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:01,932
you're gonna think it's true.

391
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,059
I don't want to tell you.

392
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,269
‐ Look, whatever it is,
if it's something bad,

393
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:07,104
even if it's something
you feel like you did

394
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,939
and you regret...
‐ I didn't do anything.

395
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:09,982
‐ It's fine.
We'll get through it.

396
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,276
‐ I didn't do anything.

397
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,486
Okay?

398
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:19,283
Some girl caught feelings,
and I didn't catch them back,

399
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:20,743
and now she wants to destroy me,

400
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,286
and she's just using
this MeToo shit

401
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:24,246
because she knows it'll work.

402
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,624
That's it.

403
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,292
‐ But did you do anything?

404
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:30,336
‐ Janay.

405
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,171
Jesus, man.
Of course I didn't do anything.

406
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,381
That's why I didn't
want to tell you,

407
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:34,924
because as soon as your name
is linked with this shit,

408
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,593
you're automatically guilty.

409
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,720
Like, you're fucked for life.

410
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,641
‐ Okay, then you fight back.

411
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,101
‐ I ca‐‐ ‐ Make a video,

412
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,311
and we could say
what actually happened.

413
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,188
‐ That's not gonna work.

414
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,607
‐ Why not?

415
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,317
‐ 'Cause people don't want
the truth, Janay.

416
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:54,527
They just want
a witch hunt, man.

417
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,155
Like, I'm terrified.

418
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,826
Being inside this,
this is fucking scary.

419
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,953
I could lose my job.
I could lose our show.

420
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,788
You think people want
to watch a fucking YouTube show

421
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,540
with a predator as a host?

422
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,170
And anything I say
will just make it worse.

423
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:17,216
I'm just‐‐there's literally
nothing I can do.

424
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:20,010
I've tried to think of shit.

425
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,220
‐ Okay, well, then
maybe there's something

426
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,221
that I can do.

427
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,181
Okay?
Maybe I can do something.

428
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:25,224
What's her name?

429
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,394
‐ I don't...

430
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,312
‐ Just tell me her name.

431
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,315
‐ You have a lot of plants.

432
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,443
‐ Plants are super important.

433
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,613
They actually create
a ton of oxygen.

434
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:42,616
They're, like, constantly...
regenerating the air.

435
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:46,162
‐ Well, wouldn't you need,
like, a thousand plants

436
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,705
for that to work?

437
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,707
‐ Well, these are succulents,
so it's different.

438
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,584
Hand me that screwdriver.

439
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,092
Succulents.

440
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:05,556
‐ You can sit down.

441
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,766
Oh.

442
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:09,143
Sorry.
I just... forgot.

443
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,775
‐ This is your new board,
by the way.

444
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,193
‐ What?

445
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,028
Really?

446
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,863
I‐‐don't‐‐

447
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,531
don't play around with me
like that

448
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,617
if it's not my board.

449
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,578
‐ Relax.
It's nothing.

450
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,413
‐ Well, okay.
Thank you.

451
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,457
That's really nice of you.
You didn't have to do that.

452
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,169
It's nice of you.

453
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:43,928
So how did you
get into skateboarding?

454
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,764
‐ I was kind of lost
after my mom died.

455
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:48,474
‐ Oh.
I didn't know.

456
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,231
‐ That's why they call me Bambi,

457
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,191
'cause my mom died in the woods.

458
00:22:00,486 --> 00:22:01,695
‐ Really?

459
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:05,950
‐ No.

460
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:11,121
But I was young,
like in the movie, though.

461
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:14,792
‐ Yeah, I know about the movie.
I never seen it, but...

462
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,418
‐ You've never seen "Bambi"?

463
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,212
‐ No, but I know
what happens in it.

464
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:22,341
Like, the mom deer dies,
and the baby g‐‐

465
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,302
‐ I've actually
never seen it either,

466
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:26,804
but don't tell anybody,
'cause...

467
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,056
‐ You sh‐‐you, of all people,
should see the movie,

468
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,225
'cause your name's‐‐
‐ You're all set.

469
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,812
Thanks.

470
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,064
It's nice.

471
00:22:39,233 --> 00:22:42,111
‐ You read
"The Alchemist," right?

472
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,329
‐ Hi, Indigo.
Thanks for coming.

473
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:54,331
‐ I thought you were done.

474
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:59,044
‐ I was, until Kirt
started textually harassing me.

475
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:00,379
‐ Look, Indigo, it's because

476
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,548
I don't want you
to stop skateboarding.

477
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,550
What happened at the skate park
isn't fair.

478
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,136
When a girl runs into a boy,
it's a big fucking deal,

479
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,555
but when a boy runs into a boy,
it doesn't even matter.

480
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,724
And I want you
to keep skateboarding!

481
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,852
And I also have... these.

482
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:26,071
We have to go through here.

483
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,209
Oh, yeah!

484
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:38,227
‐ Those aren't CDs.

485
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,896
‐ They are.
‐ Those are DVDs.

486
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,606
‐ No, they're CDs.
‐ Those?

487
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,899
No, they're not.

488
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,402
‐ No, but they're C‐‐
it's still, like, on a CD.

489
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,778
It's the same‐‐
‐ Those are movies.

490
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:50,072
‐ The round, circular,
like, shiny thing, right?

491
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,198
That's a CD.
‐ They're discs.

492
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,783
‐ They're CDs, but...

493
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,119
Hey, you have
a pretty good selection.

494
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,120
"Rescue Dawn"...

495
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,454
‐ Thank you.
Thank you so much.

496
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:58,664
‐ "Memento"?

497
00:24:58,747 --> 00:24:59,957
‐ Yeah.
Have you ever seen that?

498
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,959
‐ Yeah, I saw it in school.

499
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,127
‐ In school?
Really?

500
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,421
‐ Yeah.
I was confused.

501
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,464
Wait, you have "Camp Rock"?

502
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:09,466
Why do you have "Camp Rock"?

503
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,801
That's like the‐‐ that's, like,

504
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,678
a Disney Channel movie
from 2007.

505
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,014
‐ It's good.

506
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:17,224
‐ I mean, I thought so, too,
when I was, like, seven.

507
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,563
Interesting.

508
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:25,441
Whoa.
Oh, you have "The Jerk"?

509
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,152
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ You're a jerk.

510
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,320
Oh, my God.

511
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:32,656
‐ Wait, what's this?
What is this?

512
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,034
"Get Off My Dick"?
‐ Oh, man.

513
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:36,535
Yeah, that's the first video
I ever made.

514
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,662
I had no idea what I was doing.

515
00:25:38,746 --> 00:25:40,372
‐ All right, well,
let's watch it.

516
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:41,832
‐ No!
‐ Why not? Come on.

517
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,208
‐ We're not gonna watch
my video.

518
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,210
‐ Come on!
‐ No, no, no, no, no, no!

519
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,379
No.

520
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,716
What can we watch?

521
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,676
Oh, I know!

522
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,178
‐ "Camp Rock"?

523
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:55,679
‐ You ever seen "Downtown '81"?

524
00:25:55,763 --> 00:25:56,680
‐ No.

525
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,519
‐ You know, maybe you and I

526
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:05,856
should shoot some clips
one of these days.

527
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:08,025
‐ Yeah!
No, I'm totally down.

528
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,693
Yo, I was actually thinking
the other day about going

529
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,528
to Columbus Park and‐‐
‐ Oh, shh, shh,

530
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:13,864
you gotta see this part.
‐ Oh.

531
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:16,283
‐ Can come true.

532
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:17,993
Sometime,
it might happen to you.

533
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,828
Basquiat.

534
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:22,372
‐ Especially when you're young
in New York.

535
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:23,749
But once upon a time,

536
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,876
this place was a wild frontier,

537
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:28,504
and every youngster
who was fast on the draw

538
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,882
showed up on these streets
to try his hand.

539
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,551
Anyway, the story
you are about to see

540
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:36,011
isn't true,

541
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,430
but it isn't false, either.

542
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:40,599
Any resemblance
between the characters

543
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,018
and events depicted here
and reality

544
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:46,063
is purely magical.

545
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,398
‐ I awoke.

546
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:50,234
Had I been dreaming?

547
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,903
I think so.

548
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:56,031
I tried to remember,
but it slipped away.

549
00:26:57,825 --> 00:27:00,285
But I remembered this place.

550
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,915
Here I was again.

551
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,125
‐ This is our Winter Bowl.

552
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:09,753
‐ Yeah, except it's summer.

553
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:15,050
It's Summer's Eve Bowl.

554
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:20,138
‐ What?
I don't get it.

555
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:22,099
‐ Summer's Eve Bowl?

556
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,935
‐ So?

557
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,020
‐ Summer's Eve is a douche.

558
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:32,109
‐ Guys, I have something
to confess.

559
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:34,152
‐ What?

560
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,115
You farted?
‐ No, I did.

561
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,117
‐ Oh.
‐ No.

562
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,785
I like the girl.

563
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:45,289
‐ Wow.
I fucking knew it, bro.

564
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:48,709
‐ Tch. But don't embarrass me
like that again.

565
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,961
‐ Okay, I won't,
but I fucking knew it.

566
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,588
I knew it.

567
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,340
I knew.
I knew.

568
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:58,635
‐ I was just reading
this article,

569
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,345
and apparently,
they just figured out

570
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:02,598
the formula for...

571
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,601
how fast the universe
is expanding.

572
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,271
‐ How fast is it?

573
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,774
‐ I don't know.

574
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:20,699
‐ Oh, shit.
Look.

575
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:24,328
Shh.

576
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,713
She asleep.

577
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:43,198
Yo, how long do they need
to take to kick in?

578
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:46,201
I don't know because I don't
understand time right now.

579
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,745
‐ Where'd you find the rat?
‐ He found me.

580
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:53,500
I'm on this date
right now with this girl, Ash.

581
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:56,461
And, uh, I'm trying not
to screw it up.

582
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:02,217
Wow, look at you.
In the video already.

583
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,635
'Cause cute girls
get more views,

584
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:04,970
don't you know that?

585
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:07,139
‐ Where'd I leave my pens?
‐ I'm starting to suspect

586
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,765
you don't think
this situation is serious.

587
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,100
I need more time.

588
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,476
You've got 48 hours.

589
00:30:12,436 --> 00:30:14,730
What's going on with you
and Ash?

590
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,024
You know, things just happened.

591
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,235
This girl Yvette
has been talking shit.

592
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,029
We're about to mob, yo,
we need to go.

593
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:23,947
‐Yo!
‐Are you following me?

594
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,456
It's called fighting
the patriarchy.

595
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,291
How is throwing a skateboard
through a window

596
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,293
fighting the patriarchy?
