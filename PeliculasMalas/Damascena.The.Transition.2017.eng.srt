1
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,840
Bulgaria is known as
"The Land of Roses".

2
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,400
In 1945 the Communist regime
seized political power in the country

3
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,760
and nationalized every
private property and enterprise.

4
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,840
Rose oil distilling was monopolized
by the totalitarian state.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,280
The rose became one of the symbols
of the Communist party.

6
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,800
Based on a true story.

7
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:41,480
DAMASCENA: THE TRANSITION

8
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,640
July, 1969

9
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,760
Stop gazing at that water, Techo!

10
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,480
You'll go crazy!

11
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,600
Let's go to the deep!

12
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,760
Techo, come back!

13
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,000
Get out, Techo!

14
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,480
I'm coming down to rip your ears off!

15
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,840
All six of them!

16
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,520
Does it itch?

17
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,160
Did you enjoy the nettle?

18
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,360
Never jump off the cliffs!
Never ever again!

19
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,520
Run or I'll catch you again!

20
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,720
Feel the fragrance?

21
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,480
- Do you like it?
- Yes!

22
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,000
Don't rush!

23
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,440
We will gather for dinner later.

24
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,160
What do you think
you're doing, son?

25
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,360
You're going to break it!

26
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,080
These things cost lots of money!

27
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,480
Why don't you play it properly
so that we can enjoy the music.

28
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,680
Come here, Techo.

29
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,480
Want to learn how to dance?

30
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,480
Now. One - two.

31
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,000
Grandma, have you been
the Queen of Roses

32
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,320
when you were young?

33
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,400
Every woman is a queen
when she's young.

34
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,280
Later she turns into
a regular grandma.

35
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,280
Grandma, do ghosts
talk to people?

36
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,200
What ghosts?

37
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,000
Who tells you these fantasies?

38
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,480
No one needs to tell him!

39
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,520
His head is full of fantasies anyway!

40
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,480
More than he will ever need!

41
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,320
You're so heavy!

42
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,240
X Y Z...

43
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,920
Bravo, well done!

44
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,800
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

45
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,600
A really nice drawing, Techo.

46
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,680
Is that you?

47
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,840
Yeah.

48
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,280
And who's the woman
in the pretty dress?

49
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,760
The Queen of Roses.

50
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:18,080
When I grow up I'll build her a temple
and I'll marry her.

51
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,720
The river of my childhood
left me two friends

52
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,480
and one secret.

53
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,440
This secret became my dream.

54
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,680
I could not fulfill my dream.

55
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,120
I ran out of time.

56
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,200
May, 1978

57
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,760
What is the name
of the rose richest in oil?

58
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,880
Rose Damascena.

59
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,120
Do you know why?

60
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,680
It was brought from Damascus
in ancient times. Hence the name.

61
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,440
Is there something you don't know,
Techo?

62
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,920
It takes a million roses to make
one kilogram of rose oil.

63
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,240
One million picks,

64
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,200
one million seconds are needed
to pick all those roses.

65
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,200
Human hands are needed here!

66
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,400
The Thracians were a wise people.

67
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,040
They started growing roses here.

68
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,440
Herodotus himself mentions it!

69
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,640
And why exactly here?

70
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,880
Look at the valley!

71
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,800
The Valley of Thracian Kings.

72
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,880
Guarded by mountains
on both sides,

73
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,800
rivers flow into it and
irrigate it.

74
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,160
As if the Gods themselves protect it!

75
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,360
The most aromatic roses...

76
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,440
How many trucks left?

77
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,720
You are wasting my time all day!

78
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,720
This is the last truck for today.

79
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,640
Yeah, really!

80
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,040
Give a hand to the girls!

81
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,040
These are picked by the students!
No need to check them!

82
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,920
No need? Yeah, right!

83
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,760
As if I don't know!
Look at this!

84
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,800
Too young to cheat, right?

85
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,080
I have found stones,
bags of water

86
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,760
and all kinds of stuff inside.

87
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,960
O tempora, o mores.

88
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,080
I won't waste your time,
comrade director.

89
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,440
I just need permission to show
the refinery to the students.

90
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,720
I'm waiting for a delegation
from Sofia.

91
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,440
The biggest rose oil buyer.

92
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,680
So I'm a little busy.

93
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,480
Here they come.

94
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,400
Come on, ladies.

95
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Welcome!

96
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,080
I hope you had a pleasant trip.

97
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,840
Good to be here.

98
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,400
Such a winding road!

99
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,360
And we got really hungry...

100
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,080
A welcome fit for a tzar,
comrade Kolev!

101
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,800
Oh, I forgot.

102
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,720
We have a student brigade.

103
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,920
The teacher asks whether they can
see the refinery.

104
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,480
Excuse me?

105
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,000
Do you think I need some
little moles here?

106
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,160
Why?

107
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,320
What's going on here?

108
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,600
It does not matter whether
they are students or not ...

109
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,920
From now on, no outsiders!

110
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,120
Is that clear?

111
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,960
Yes! Move it, move it!

112
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,760
Mr. Leibnitz...

113
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,120
Please, do come in!

114
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,440
Bulgarian Rose
- the scent of communism.

115
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,320
Here's the new generation.

116
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,120
I'll be back.
I'll throw you out of here!

117
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,280
I'll kick out the likes of you too!

118
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,000
Go on.

119
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,560
Rose oil is "Liquid Gold", they say.

120
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,280
It brought millions and millions
to the state.

121
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,840
For me the rose oil distillery was
a temple, not a cash machine.

122
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,840
May, 1986

123
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,400
I'm sick and tired of
small time crooks.

124
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,360
Everyone cheats in this country.

125
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,480
Everyone tries to profit
at the expense of the state.

126
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,320
But I won't allow it!
I won't!

127
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,160
Hey, give me that skewer!

128
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,360
How are you, guys?

129
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,800
Fine, thank you.

130
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,840
- Do you want to see the refinery?
- Yes!

131
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,200
Follow me.

132
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,280
And you, go to the scales!

133
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,560
You are born in this valley.

134
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,240
Our "Liquid Gold" is world famous.
You must know how it's made.

135
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,880
Kemal!

136
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,760
Kemal...

137
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,440
I want you to buy them
some waffles and sweets.

138
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,520
They have been picking roses since five
in the morning and they deserve a treat.

139
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,200
Come on.

140
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:53,360
This is our new expert,
Stefan Stefanov.

141
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,000
To us he's Techo.
Please, sit down.

142
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:06,040
Do you feel the difference
between '83 and '84?

143
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,080
Yes.

144
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,240
Something's missing here.

145
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,560
That's because 1984 was rainy.

146
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,200
This has the necessary intensity.
It's 1983.

147
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:51,480
Can you compensate technologically
for the missing intensity?

148
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,000
?here are some new tanks in the back...

149
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,240
Anyone can do it with new tanks.

150
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,400
Give me a new solution.

151
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,480
Are you Stefan Stefanov?

152
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,880
I am.

153
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,040
- Hello.
- Hello.

154
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,400
Let's get straight to the point.

155
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,520
Here's the list of all people
working at the rose oil distillery.

156
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,560
Lots of fezzes you've got here!

157
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,160
You know the new directive
about the names, right?

158
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:55,960
A week from now there
should be no Turkish names.

159
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,600
I grew up together with these people.
We are friends.

160
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,720
Hasan and Yusuf yesterday -
Ivan and Kiril tomorrow? How?

161
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,640
You just gave them names -
and very good ones at that.

162
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,200
You are their friend and
will easily convince them.

163
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,080
We've investigated you - that's why
we turn to you, not to the director.

164
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,880
Techo, who's gonna get
this job done?  Who?

165
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,600
How do I turn Hassan into Dragan?

166
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,000
You know how it works.

167
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:25,600
Calmly, gently...
Some beating, if needed.

168
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,680
Are you Bulgarians?

169
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,480
Are YOU Bulgarian?

170
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,480
Who can we trust?

171
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,560
Don't you see what's going on?

172
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,520
They breed like rabbits.

173
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,440
And now what?
Kill them like rabbits?

174
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,680
They will kick us out!

175
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,280
They will establish a state
of their own in our land.

176
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,920
They will demand autonomy?
They'll take everything.

177
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,160
They'll change your name to Hasan.

178
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,240
They will kick you out but before that
they might even intimately ?

179
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,600
You will sit and watch?

180
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,800
Behave like a Bulgarian.
And act like a Bulgarian.

181
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,680
Well but?
Above all I'm a human.

182
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,240
Right, now we will see how
humane you are.

183
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,880
Keep your temper and it will be ok.

184
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,320
Come on!

185
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,080
Comrades, colleagues!

186
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,560
The Party council wants to help you
accomplish the Party's decree

187
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:44,600
for changing the names
of our Bulgarian Turks.

188
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,320
What's up, buddy?

189
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,440
They made you come here as well?

190
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,200
Get inside, it will be fine.

191
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,880
Comrades...

192
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:24,160
Let's live and work in harmony.
There should be no differences between us.

193
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,320
We do live and work together!
What's wrong all of a sudden?

194
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,880
Listen, listen...

195
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,240
I know it's hard.
But it's hard for all of us.

196
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,880
The Party council made this
decision to unite the people.

197
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,240
Let's look forward.

198
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,800
Our children will live together without
the embarrassment of their names.

199
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,600
We will all be one big
Bulgarian family.

200
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,560
Comrade ... Pretty,
enough bullshit!

201
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,000
Get lost, you sleazy bitch,
get lost!

202
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,240
Wait, wait!

203
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,280
Why change names? Ah? Why?

204
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,080
We don't want to!

205
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,880
I'm sorry, cousin!

206
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,840
Does it hurt?

207
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,400
- Techo?
- I'm fine.

208
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,600
You're not welcome
in my home anymore.

209
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,320
And what about Kemal?

210
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,400
They released him earlier.

211
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,320
Kemal! What have they
done to you?

212
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,520
I'm no longer Kemal.

213
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,480
My name is Kalin.

214
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,960
The voluntary departure must be
done in a calm and orderly manner.

215
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,680
What are you doing?

216
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,320
You will be escorted to the border.

217
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,720
What are you doing?

218
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,960
Hey! Hey!

219
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,800
Stop! Stop!

220
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,400
Stop, stop!

221
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,560
What are you doing, are you mad?

222
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,320
These people live here,
these are their homes.

223
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,800
How many times do I need
to tell you?

224
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,880
How many times?

225
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,960
Do not show off these trousers!

226
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,440
How many times do I need to tell you
not to show off these trousers!

227
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,200
What are you doing? Hey!

228
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,360
Pack your things tonight!

229
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,240
Are you mad?

230
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,120
Wait, buddy!

231
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,360
?must be done in a calm and
orderly manner.

232
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,960
Easy, Techo. Easy!

233
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,920
Go home before we
lock you up.

234
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,960
- Are you mad?
- Don't get involved!

235
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,920
Don't touch him!

236
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,720
Techo! Easy, buddy!

237
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,800
Just go home so we don't have to
lock you up again.

238
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,960
Don't get involved!

239
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,240
You can't do anything!

240
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,880
You can't do anything!

241
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,560
Pack your things!

242
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,840
... must be done
in a calm and orderly manner.

243
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,000
You will be escorted to the border.

244
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,160
The deadline is 4 pm tomorrow.

245
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,760
Take the scarf off.

246
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,640
Here are the papers
for the car.

247
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,000
Hundreds of thousands of Bulgarian
Turks were banished from their homes,

248
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,360
from their native lands.

249
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,120
The Rose Valley became deserted.

250
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,640
I hate you all!

251
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,400
How will I live without you?

252
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:15,320
Don't build houses
on high hills.

253
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:25,680
Don't give away brides
in far away lands.

254
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:45,080
Let the birds know
I miss my mother.

255
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,800
Dear motherland,

256
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:58,080
you are heaven on earth,

257
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:07,680
your vigor, your beauty...

258
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,680
Yeah...

259
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:22,160
This year we will buy no roses
and produce no oil at all.

260
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,920
Things are different now.

261
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,800
After the changes... the
Western buyers are cautious.

262
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:36,680
So ... we're closing.

263
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,360
Temporarily.

264
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,960
Not just this distillery.

265
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,280
All distilleries.

266
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,400
And we'll see who
will survive.

267
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,360
So why did you call for me?

268
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,720
To find out what you
gonna do next.

269
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,880
You haven't changed much since
high school.

270
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,120
You thought I didn't
recognize you?

271
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,480
Well done, you kept your promise.
You're back.

272
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,360
Only you haven't
kicked us out yet.

273
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,680
Will you sell me the tanks
rusting in the back yard?

274
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,320
- What? They're brand new!
- They used to be brand new!

275
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,960
Even if you get the tanks,
you have no roses.

276
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,720
I hold all the contracts
with the buyers ...

277
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,240
The lab is mine ...

278
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,480
I thought it was owned by the state...

279
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:49,840
But you still need me
to sell even a drop of rose oil.

280
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:53,880
Sell him the tanks.

281
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,360
What about me?

282
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,920
Boss, we are off.

283
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,280
Wait a sec!

284
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,960
Treat yourself to a drink
for the good work.

285
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,400
Thanks, see you tomorrow.

286
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,400
I thought you'd never come.

287
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:04,240
You can use an extra hand.

288
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,320
- How are things at home?
- Well...

289
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,000
Your brother's drinking
will get him fired.

290
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:29,080
I don't know what to do
with him.

291
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,360
Do you think I should hire him?

292
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,080
DAMASCENA
First Private Rose Oil Distillery

293
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,760
Your brother won't say no but...

294
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,240
I will give it a try.

295
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,280
Tell Kiril he's welcome.

296
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,520
I will.

297
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,080
Come here!

298
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,360
No way you'll be hiding
the money from me!

299
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,160
Where's the money?

300
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,080
Hey...

301
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,960
Hey, come here!

302
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,240
I'll kick your asses!

303
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,160
- Who are you?
- Gyula. (Rose)

304
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,920
Now my name is Detelina.

305
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,040
- And who are these two?
- My brothers.

306
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:36,000
If they try to beat you again,
call me.

307
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,240
You call this a beating?

308
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,920
And learn how to read.

309
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,320
First Private Rose Oil
Distillery Damascena.

310
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,320
What's damascena?

311
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,800
A rose, like you.

312
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,200
Did you name it after me?

313
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,960
A Bulgarian rose from me,

314
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,720
to remind you...

315
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,480
Was about time!

316
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:38,000
- Am I that late?
- More than I expected.

317
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,240
Sit down!

318
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,680
Put it down!

319
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:46,400
To Mr. Leibnitz,
CEO for Eastern Europe etc.

320
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,160
Dear and so on?

321
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,800
within 3 months we will present
a detailed business plan

322
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,720
for the capacity of the first
private rose oil distillery in Bulgaria,

323
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,480
which is my property
and will be run by me.

324
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,320
The investigations by Bulgarian
authorities have proven

325
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,840
that the documents and pictures
you have received

326
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:12,200
from Stefan Stefanov regarding
an existing private rose oil distillery

327
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,680
are fraudulent.

328
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,600
Fraudulent!

329
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,840
- Got it?
- Yes.

330
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,520
All necessary measures
will be taken

331
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,400
in order to cut out
any speculations whatsoever.

332
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,000
In expectation of our future
work together,

333
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,880
in your capacity of our biggest client,

334
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,040
we, as the first private oil
distillers in Bulgaria,

335
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,400
truly yours, bla bla bla...

336
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,560
Send it to the translator and
make sure he does it quickly.

337
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,000
10,000 dollars.

338
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,680
Now, how can I help you?

339
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,640
Techo?

340
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,200
I came to ask you to be
my kid's godfather.

341
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,800
Techo!

342
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,240
There's a famous
German philosopher...

343
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:53,840
You don't know him,
his name is Friedrich Nietzsche.

344
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,960
He says...

345
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,800
It means:

346
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,400
"What is will never be,

347
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,360
what will be has never been."

348
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,200
Are you done?

349
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,760
I accept!

350
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,680
This is for you, then.

351
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,560
Godfather.

352
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,240
It's not 10,000 dollars, but...

353
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,000
I'll call you with the details.

354
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,320
We made it.

355
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,320
Prepare the purchase contract
for the rose oil distillery.

356
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,480
Let us pray to God!

357
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,760
Do you renounce Satan?

358
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,880
I do.

359
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,280
Do you renounce Satan?

360
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,240
I do.

361
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,920
Do you renounce Satan?

362
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,680
I do.

363
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,560
Hey boss,

364
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,320
when did you become
a Christian?

365
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,360
Faith is the only savior of the soul.

366
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,120
Sinful are the children of God.

367
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,320
But God is merciful and patient.

368
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,960
I don't understand God's way.

369
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:23,520
-Call me to bless the rose oil distillery!
- No need for that!

370
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,680
You shouldn't bypass me
by writing to the Germans.

371
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,440
You can't skip me
in the rose oil business.

372
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,040
I had to try.

373
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,320
You're crazy!

374
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,080
I know that.

375
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,600
Do I tell you you're crazy?

376
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,120
Yesterday you were
a zealous communist.

377
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,240
Today you're an avid democrat
and pious Christian.

378
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,960
My ex boss has become a priest.

379
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,080
Don't tell me miracles don't exist!

380
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,080
What are you building
by the river?

381
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:15,440
A Temple of the Rose - a part
of the complex I'm planning.

382
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,960
Little by little it will be ready.

383
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,760
There's no end to your
wacky ideas!

384
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,640
It's not a wacky idea,
it's a dream.

385
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:28,040
Alright. I'll leave you the temple.

386
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,440
You are convinced that I'm crazy,
so I really need tell you.

387
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:40,040
I'll burn down the distillery
rather than give it to you.

388
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,480
Are you nuts?

389
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,360
Crazy, naive?

390
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,200
I don't get you at all!

391
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,240
If it wasn't for me, no one
would've given you a penny.

392
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,160
No one!

393
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,480
The distillery is mine!
Is that clear?

394
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,480
Who do you think you are?

395
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,000
Oh, Lord, hear my prayer.
Amen.

396
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,320
This rose oil distillery,
Farmarose is blessed

397
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:58,760
in the name of the Father, and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

398
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,560
Mr. Kolev, just a moment!

399
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:07,080
How long did it take you to build the
first private distillery in Bulgaria?

400
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:14,760
Long enough so I can now turn back
and proudly say that it was worth it.

401
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,440
- Mr. Kolev?
- Later.

402
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,880
Is everything OK with the money?

403
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,360
I haven't count it.

404
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:32,040
Techo, there is place
for everyone under the sun.

405
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,560
Please tell me how I can help you.

406
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,880
I need twice as much as you paid me.

407
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,520
As a loan.

408
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,040
When do you need it?

409
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,600
Yesterday.

410
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,720
You'll have it tonight.

411
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:08,320
We, the first private rose oil producers,
did it.

412
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,240
We did it.
Congratulations.

413
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,040
What's up, bro?

414
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,360
I'm going back to the city,
there's nothing for me here.

415
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,360
Brother!

416
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,760
I know you've got 7 kilos
of my rose oil in the trunk.

417
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,440
You have a choice.

418
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:26,880
You can either give me back my oil
and we go on together.

419
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,360
Or you can go to the city

420
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,000
and we forget we're brothers.

421
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,480
You know what...

422
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,640
Is she worth it?

423
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,720
She will bring you money.

424
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,000
What's going on?

425
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,160
We fixed Gyula.
We'll get some cash.

426
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,320
Is this the life you want?

427
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,760
You call this a life?

428
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,000
Cousin ...

429
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:00,480
This girl is coming with me.

430
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,880
Get up!

431
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:52,320
Don't worry,
the baby's asleep in the back.

432
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,880
The baby peed on the dollars.

433
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,880
I hope it's a lucky charm.

434
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,880
Where are we going?

435
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,760
I don't know.

436
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:28,000
Today the national currency continued
its severe devaluation.

437
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:32,640
One US dollar traded for 2100 levs
on the interbank market.

438
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:36,240
The cash markets followed
a different logic.

439
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:41,360
The USD interbank trade started at
BGL 1500 -1650,

440
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,120
but by noon the exchange rate
was up by BGL 500,

441
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,240
and the ask spread hit
BGL 2150 at noon.

442
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,520
Then the rate decreased and
a balance was reached

443
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,960
at a bid spread of BGL 1800
and an ask spread of BGL 2100.

444
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:57,160
It is paradox that an ask spread
is significantly below the bit spread.

445
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,560
Trading was strained.

446
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:01,920
USD 6.6 million were bought
and almost USD 5 million were sold.

447
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,520
The volumes are below the ones
common for the past days.

448
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,160
I do not expect that from you.

449
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:11,160
The national currency again lost
more than 20% of its value in just a day.

450
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,440
Since the start of the year,
the dollar

451
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,480
has tripled its value against
Bulgarian lev.

452
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:18,080
The USD appreciated
with nearly 200 BGL today.

453
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:53,080
Are you ok?

454
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:04,640
The posters read: "Pensions - 5 dollars,
sausage - 2 dollars"

455
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,560
The protesters shouted against

456
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:12,880
a new socialist government
and in favor of early elections.

457
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,920
Elections! Elections!

458
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:23,520
Take some money from the sack and
go buy something for yourself.

459
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:25,360
What something?

460
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:28,160
Clothes, shoes,
whatever you need.

461
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,880
And get disposable diapers
for the baby.

462
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,000
Tell them the baby's age.

463
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,360
Seven months.

464
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,960
Do you want anything?

465
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,200
No.

466
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,640
You're staying here.

467
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,760
First Private Bank

468
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,640
Give our money back

469
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,480
Hey, where are you going?

470
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,480
The line's back there!

471
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,600
Hey, wise ass,
take you place at the back!

472
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,800
Where you going with the sacks,
get back!

473
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:24,960
Go inside and tell your boss that
Techo is waiting for him outside.

474
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,000
Can you please go to the
end of the line?

475
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,960
I've been freezing here all day for
20 dollars and now that guy ...

476
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,840
Easy, there are dollars
for everyone.

477
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:45,800
What are you doing here, Techo?

478
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,680
The privileged ones will never end...

479
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,200
Keep calm.

480
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:57,680
It's a madhouse,
the dollar has gone through the roof!

481
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,400
Yes, indeed.

482
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,320
This isn't inflation,
it's an outright catastrophe.

483
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:09,120
The dollar reached
BGL 3000 in a day.

484
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:10,560
And what?

485
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:14,480
Everybody's gone nuts,
trading their last penny.

486
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,160
I know it.

487
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,600
I can see it from the hotel
over there.

488
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:21,600
But I tell you, the dollar
will fall in 3 days.

489
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:24,720
It can't happen.
It'll take at least a month.

490
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,080
I bet my beard on it.

491
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,640
And I bet my hair.

492
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,480
You want these dollars?

493
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,080
You're killing yourself, bro.

494
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:42,680
Do you want them,
or should I go to your neighbors!

495
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:47,920
Did you piss on it?

496
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,240
Just take them.

497
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,440
Money doesn't smell,
that's what people say.

498
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,320
Plank, come here!

499
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,080
Handsome, though.

500
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:16,320
Here are the levs.
Where are my dollars?

501
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,080
Give him the dollars.

502
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,560
Hey, Plank.

503
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:33,560
You gonna stick around here?

504
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,200
Come with me.

505
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,040
Get off, please.

506
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,800
You'll live here.

507
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:45,320
My friends will help you -
with the kid, with the school.

508
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,360
If things turn out well,
you might come to work for me.

509
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:54,560
But for now,
this is the right way.

510
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:57,720
Get off, please.

511
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:53,320
I'll never fancy another man, Techo.

512
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,520
I only have eyes for you.

513
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:31,120
May you have women,
but be deprived of love.

514
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:48,520
I kept building the temple
of the rose by the river

515
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,040
near the place where
it all started.

516
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:55,880
Dreams are always
greater than prayers.

517
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:59,080
It's very hard to deceive
a dreamer.

518
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:04,640
A lie may slow him down
but will never stop him.

519
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,640
How do you manage to spend
so much money in no time?

520
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:24,200
Last month I gave you 100 000 dollars.

521
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:26,320
You not only spent all the money
from the rose oil distillery,

522
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:28,880
but you are trying to kill yourself
with new loans every month.

523
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:33,040
I pay you back, don't I?
Along with the monstrous interest.

524
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,400
You see...

525
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:40,040
The temple of the rose requires
a lot of money.

526
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,920
Be careful, Techo!

527
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:10,960
My head flies off if you ...

528
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:20,400
I'll need some extra help.

529
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:02,080
Shave my beard!

530
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:43,320
Son, I've been watching you
for years.

531
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:51,200
The freedom you search for
does not exist.

532
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:56,880
It's an illusion...

533
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:00,040
It's a prison...

534
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,200
A prison!

535
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:09,800
To be free means to
choose your own prison.

536
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,400
You're greedy.

537
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:19,760
A man shouldn't be greedy.

538
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,520
Money,

539
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:30,600
women,

540
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,120
freedom.

541
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:39,200
Everyone has his own limits.

542
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:44,680
Limits for all three of these.

543
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:48,680
If a man goes over his limits,

544
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,280
they crush him

545
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:55,360
and that's all.

546
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:00,600
He's finished.

547
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:22,840
You were such a wild kid!

548
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:27,680
Look at you now.

549
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:34,400
So many people
depend on you.

550
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:25,360
Techo, you promised me!

551
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:28,480
You promised me!

552
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,040
Dad?

553
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:33,840
You promised me!

554
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:35,600
Roses will blossom -
with or without us.

555
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:47,080
Well...
with us is preferable.

556
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:55,280
I'm leaving you too soon,
my son.

557
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:58,080
Too soon...

558
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:09,400
Yes, you left me too soon.

559
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:12,080
We had so much to do together.

560
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:15,480
Too soon!

561
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:18,200
All left me!

562
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,320
Fate left me too!

563
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:00,680
Where are your workers,
Stavri?

564
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:06,680
They're packing and leaving.

565
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:12,000
Oranges, olives, dishes -
whatever pays.

566
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,480
Germany, Spain...

567
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,840
Who knows where.

568
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:28,000
Where is that Terminal 2 that swallows
our children like a dragon.

569
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:30,920
Tell them not to leave.

570
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,920
What for?

571
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:39,720
Let them know that from now on
I will double their pay!

572
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:45,520
Don't do that!
We'll lose everything.

573
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:48,920
You'll fuck up the others, too.
They'll kill us!

574
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:52,600
What if the buyers
disagree?

575
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:55,960
That's a fucking suicide!

576
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:00,200
First time ever, right?

577
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:19,720
Emigration -
the modern slavery.

578
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:25,080
A subtle slavery that allows for
the illusion of freedom.

579
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:28,960
2.5 million Bulgarians
have left the country.

580
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:33,680
Not a single war
has caused so much damage.

581
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:19,480
I thought you'd never come.

582
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:24,800
You can use an extra hand.

583
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:10,480
I can't buy your oil, Techo.
These are hard times.

584
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:16,000
Everyone produces,
but there are no buyers, no markets.

585
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:18,720
Turkey is crushing us.

586
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:20,080
Turkey.

587
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,520
Bulgaria.

588
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,800
Bulgaria.

589
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,120
Turkey.

590
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:38,720
That's it, we're done.

591
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:42,920
Now Bulgaria is missing
from the rose oil map.

592
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
So what do we do?

593
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:48,200
Nothing but pray.

594
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,840
- You're praying?
- Yes.

595
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:57,400
Leave that to the priests.

596
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:07,400
Turkey you say.

597
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:09,800
Turkey.

598
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:29,120
Here's some water.

599
01:18:53,640 --> 01:18:55,280
That's for you.

600
01:19:25,680 --> 01:19:28,120
Hey girl.

601
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:31,160
Girl...

602
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,840
Just tell me who did it.

603
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:38,240
Tell me who did it.

604
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:03,120
Are you the big boss here,
Techo?

605
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,680
Fuck you!

606
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:07,800
Are you...

607
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:11,240
I'll kill you!

608
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:22,880
An old acquaintance.

609
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:26,840
That was a good beating.

610
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:31,240
He's alive.

611
01:21:34,520 --> 01:21:38,200
Hey Scarface,
do you hear me, scum?

612
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:42,040
Do you get what I'm saying?
Did they beat you up?

613
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,960
I fell from my horse!

614
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:47,080
Did Techo beat you up?
Tell me!

615
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:49,120
Tell me!

616
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:52,800
I haven't seen him.
I fell from my horse.

617
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,000
A wild horse, maybe?

618
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,440
You should have killed
the scum, cousin.

619
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:00,600
You should.

620
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,800
He's one of yours.

621
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:05,520
He pays you, not me.

622
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:12,280
Don't be like that.

623
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:16,000
He pays you to protect
him when he steals,

624
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:20,160
beats people,
rapes his daughter.

625
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:28,880
What about his daughter?

626
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,280
The scum raped his daughter.

627
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:43,520
Fucking life.

628
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:49,280
Fucking country.

629
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:52,000
Fucking scum.

630
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,000
How long?

631
01:22:56,440 --> 01:23:00,760
I've served scums
my whole life.

632
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:06,200
Why?

633
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:09,640
I served scums before,
I serve them now.

634
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:11,760
Stay away!

635
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:15,040
- Wait, cousin!
- Stay away!

636
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,200
Get lost!

637
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,880
For how long?!

638
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,200
Cousin...

639
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:29,120
I can't take it anymore.

640
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:33,000
For how long?!

641
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:34,120
Tell me!

642
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:36,160
Why the fuck?!

643
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,400
Why?

644
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:29,160
Hasan Bey,

645
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:33,840
Bulgaria and Turkey are the largest
rose oil producers in the world.

646
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,920
We were a leader until recently.

647
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:38,640
The markets were yours,
but now they're ours.

648
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:41,800
It isn't our fault that your country
has problems.

649
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:45,200
We're making large investments in
rose plantations.

650
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:47,440
We have a good product.

651
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,680
Western companies came with
their investments.

652
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:56,240
Leave us this much. 20%.

653
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:03,400
Give us some room to breathe.

654
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:07,840
There's terrible corruption
in Bulgaria.

655
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:11,320
The Communist elite
switched sides.

656
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:15,400
Now they are the rich ones
who rip off the society.

657
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:21,280
Other nouveau riche come from
the criminal underground.

658
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:25,960
We look after our business,
you better fix your country.

659
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:29,120
I can see you know very well
the problems in Bulgaria.

660
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:34,760
With all due respect, Hasan Bey,
my forecast is that in 7-8 years

661
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:39,960
you will have problems similar to ours.

662
01:25:40,280 --> 01:25:44,600
The wheel spins.
Things may turn around.

663
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:48,840
I don't see how.

664
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:52,360
I will turn them around.

665
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:03,280
Only time will show.

666
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,680
May Allah be with you.

667
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:16,080
Cousin, stop the car.
Stop the car.

668
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,080
Take me back to the clinic.

669
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:27,120
Take me back.

670
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:05,960
Hey cousin,

671
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:09,120
I'll come to see you often.

672
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:13,520
Don't worry about me.

673
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:18,000
You're not a free man, cousin.

674
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:22,080
I'm the free one among us.

675
01:30:10,120 --> 01:30:12,320
I started drinking.

676
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:16,200
I really hit the bottom.

677
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:19,120
I gave up.

678
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:53,000
Did you forget me?

679
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:59,000
I didn't forget you.

680
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:02,200
I renounced you.

681
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:09,280
Why did you stop dreaming?

682
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:17,200
Because I became a slave.

683
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:19,960
A slave of the state,

684
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:22,200
to the banks,

685
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:26,680
to the mafia, to their money,

686
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:29,520
to my women, to my children.

687
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:32,920
A slave to everything
and everyone!

688
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:38,120
It's a voluntary prison.

689
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:44,600
And you leave it
voluntarily too!

690
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:00,600
Good morning!

691
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:08,760
Techo, I've known you for ages.
Why didn't you call me earlier?

692
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:14,400
You sound like an
abandoned lover.

693
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:18,720
You don't understand, do you?
You were dead.

694
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:22,200
I've been drinking
for three weeks.

695
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:25,640
You would be dead
on the third day.

696
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:31,560
You really don't get it.

697
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:35,320
Your condition is really serious.
Some tests must be made.

698
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:39,400
You've had symptoms
long before, haven't you?

699
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:42,240
Symptoms.

700
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:46,520
I have symptoms
as many as you like.

701
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,760
I'll be going.

702
01:33:50,880 --> 01:33:56,840
Well, how do you want me to say it -
delicately or outright?

703
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:07,240
Delicately speaking, there is
a tumor somewhere inside you.

704
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:57,160
In the head?

705
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:03,400
In the head.

706
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:08,080
And?

707
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:11,640
How much time do I have?

708
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:16,280
Plenty of time if I cut it out.
Prepare yourself for surgery.

709
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:19,680
Well...

710
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:22,560
And what if you don't
cut it out?

711
01:35:23,160 --> 01:35:27,160
It will continue to grow and
depending on how aggressive it is

712
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:30,000
it could be months, weeks,

713
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:31,960
tomorrow.

714
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:40,320
Tomorrow?

715
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:34,080
I see, you're afraid.

716
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:36,480
You don't get it at all.

717
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:40,520
No, it's normal.
We're all afraid.

718
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:48,440
But you're lucky because
I am a really good surgeon.

719
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:51,280
I am calling the team.

720
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:54,080
You really don't get it.

721
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:57,960
No, I don't.

722
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:04,560
If you have to do
something important

723
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:11,240
and you can postpone it for
tomorrow, will you do it today?

724
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:16,040
What if you have no tomorrow?

725
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:22,040
That thing in my head will remind
me that I have no tomorrow.

726
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:26,400
I don't get it.

727
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:29,800
Where is the nurse?

728
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,600
What nurse?

729
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:00,320
I've run out of time.

730
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:03,240
The dream stayed with me.

731
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:08,000
The tumor in my head is
not a verdict but a gift.

732
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:11,520
A gift to make me realize that
I have no tomorrow

733
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:14,760
and that my past is gone, too.

734
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:21,160
They exist only in my thoughts.
Now I know how to deceive time.

735
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:25,760
I've learned to live now,
in the very moment.

736
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:31,880
To be today is my tomorrow.

737
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:02,800
Boss...

738
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:25,600
- Hello, Stefan Bey.
- Hasan Bey.

739
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:28,280
That's my son.

740
01:43:30,840 --> 01:43:34,200
I underestimated your words,
Stefan Bey.

741
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:38,000
That's in the past.

742
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:45,240
Now we need to work together to
retain and expand our global markets.

743
01:43:46,120 --> 01:43:49,960
And by saying "our markets"
I mean ours and yours.

744
01:43:50,120 --> 01:43:53,920
That's the responsibility
that we have to deal with.

745
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:58,640
So the war between us is over,
do I get it right?

746
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:01,040
There has been no war.

747
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:06,400
It was just a misunderstanding that
we don't have similar problems.

748
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:11,960
The people are most important,
Hasan Bey, the people.

749
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:17,240
This is Gyula.

750
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:21,040
She'll be in charge of our
joint operations.

751
01:44:23,440 --> 01:44:25,800
Thank you, Stefan Bey.

752
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:33,160
Let me show you
the rose oil distillery.

753
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:19,160
Techo, aren't you aiming too high,
my boy?

754
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:27,960
You bought the house of the biggest
rose oil producer of the 20th century.

755
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:30,560
You must be dreaming.

756
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:33,760
I've been a dreamer all my life.

757
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:35,920
Back to business.

758
01:45:36,840 --> 01:45:40,440
I have a very big request from
an Asian buyer.

759
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:44,000
I could manage the first year
of the contract alone.

760
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:48,200
Now I will need your help?
and your rose oil.

761
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:49,800
Just a moment!

762
01:45:49,960 --> 01:45:52,680
You are skipping me,
Techo, and that's no good.

763
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,040
You forget something important.

764
01:45:55,320 --> 01:46:00,800
I mix the oils and
I do the trading.

765
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:07,040
We have been making rose oil
for 25 years.

766
01:46:08,240 --> 01:46:11,960
We have been giving it to you and
have been waiting for your schemes,

767
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:16,280
your filthy games with quantities,
commissions and buyers.

768
01:46:20,200 --> 01:46:25,800
I got a letter from
all the major buyers.

769
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:30,040
They officially declare their will
to work with me directly.

770
01:46:30,120 --> 01:46:32,880
Who will guarantee the quality?

771
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:36,360
Who will sign the certificates?

772
01:46:36,760 --> 01:46:42,440
The first independent lab is ready.
It is fully licensed.

773
01:46:42,760 --> 01:46:46,960
You can find all the details
in this document.

774
01:46:47,240 --> 01:46:53,560
We're ready to certify and guarantee
the quality of every producer's rose oil.

775
01:46:54,360 --> 01:46:56,600
We are ready to start right away.

776
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:58,840
Thank you, Gyula.

777
01:46:59,320 --> 01:47:02,480
Now you have a choice.

778
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:06,280
We can do this properly.

779
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:11,800
We can produce and sell rose oil together.
I emphasize together.

780
01:47:12,720 --> 01:47:19,840
We can just as well
continue working with Mr. Kolev.

781
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:24,520
My promise is to sell
your oil first?

782
01:47:24,640 --> 01:47:25,680
One moment!

783
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:27,200
? commission free.

784
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:29,200
I will sell mine last.

785
01:47:29,320 --> 01:47:33,800
The prices I will fight for will
ensure the development of our business.

786
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:37,120
The rest is up to you.

787
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:40,120
I'm with you, my friend.

788
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:41,120
I say yes!

789
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:42,880
- Me too!
- Me too.

790
01:47:43,240 --> 01:47:44,400
Me too.

791
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,560
Techo, you have a yes from me.

792
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:51,240
Yes.

793
01:47:57,040 --> 01:47:58,600
Me too.

794
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:40,800
They call Bulgaria "The Land of Roses".

795
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:44,760
In 2008 Bulgaria regained its leading
position in the rose oil market

796
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:48,280
due to the efforts
of all private producers.
