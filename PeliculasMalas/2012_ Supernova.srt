1
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,558
Yeah!

2
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:10,936
What?

3
00:02:13,142 --> 00:02:14,210
Already?

4
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,471
That's too far ahead of schedule.

5
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:22,286
Jesus!

6
00:02:22,756 --> 00:02:24,188
Yeah, I'll be right there.

7
00:02:24,998 --> 00:02:26,289
Yeah, I'm coming right now.

8
00:02:31,823 --> 00:02:34,300
Laura!

9
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:36,260
Laura!

10
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,325
What?

11
00:02:37,426 --> 00:02:38,725
We got to get to the base.
Something happened.

12
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,716
Everything okay?
Something serious?

13
00:02:40,817 --> 00:02:42,516
Just meet me in the car in
5 minutes. I'll get Tina.

14
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,511
Okay.

15
00:03:27,626 --> 00:03:28,870
Dad what's going on?

16
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,924
Hi, baby.
5 minutes, meet me in the car?

17
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,696
Did you see what's happening outside?
What should we do?

18
00:03:32,816 --> 00:03:35,783
Just stay calm, I need you to pack an
overnight bag. We're going to the base.

19
00:03:35,903 --> 00:03:37,802
- How long are we to be gone?
- Not long.

20
00:03:37,922 --> 00:03:39,834
- So I don't pack that much
- I don't know, baby.

21
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:42,193
Just get what you can and maybe
we come back for the rest.

22
00:03:42,313 --> 00:03:43,454
But I got to get to the
base as soon as possible.

23
00:03:43,464 --> 00:03:44,764
I want you there
with me, okay?

24
00:03:45,421 --> 00:03:46,412
Okay.

25
00:03:53,522 --> 00:03:55,130
Come on, Laura.
Let's go!

26
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:37,416
What's Kelvin’s ETA?

27
00:04:38,965 --> 00:04:40,420
Somebody give me an answer ASAP!

28
00:04:41,691 --> 00:04:44,637
I've got a force launch going in the space
loaded with nukes, way ahead of schedule

29
00:04:44,757 --> 00:04:45,952
why is he not in here?

30
00:04:46,072 --> 00:04:48,147
His locator shows him
nearly 60 miles of-site

31
00:04:48,393 --> 00:04:50,999
- Get an escort and get it to him now
- Yes, sir.

32
00:04:51,586 --> 00:04:53,276
Sir, that blast came out of nowhere.

33
00:04:53,396 --> 00:04:55,827
Another one like that might take
our launch systems off-line.

34
00:04:57,658 --> 00:04:58,926
Recommendations?

35
00:05:01,945 --> 00:05:06,488
Well, the faster it gets up there,
the sooner it comes down and gets reloaded.

36
00:05:08,671 --> 00:05:11,511
- Commence countdown.
- Copy that. Countdown commenced.

37
00:05:12,441 --> 00:05:16,760
5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

38
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:18,319
Go!

39
00:05:18,929 --> 00:05:20,103
Rockets firing...

40
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:23,709
And we now lift off...

41
00:05:40,056 --> 00:05:41,117
The rocket is up, sir

42
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:42,779
Now, get him in here.

43
00:05:47,943 --> 00:05:49,605
Ryan, can you slow down?

44
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:57,467
I guess I shouldn't even bother asking
why we're going to the base.

45
00:05:58,302 --> 00:05:59,683
I just can't, Laura.

46
00:06:11,113 --> 00:06:13,179
If you found out why, then...

47
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,988
I wouldn't be doing my job.

48
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:20,852
Thanks, baby
That's very reassuring.

49
00:06:25,306 --> 00:06:27,175
You are unbelievable!
Unbelievable!

50
00:06:44,192 --> 00:06:45,450
Is that one of yours?

51
00:06:52,585 --> 00:06:53,965
Go! Go!

52
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:23,749
Oh my God!

53
00:07:24,594 --> 00:07:27,429
Are you kidding me right now?
Who was that? Why would people be after us?

54
00:07:27,786 --> 00:07:28,753
I'm not sure.

55
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,557
Not sure 'cause you don't know
or you're not sure,

56
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,857
because it's another
stupid government cover-up.

57
00:07:33,156 --> 00:07:34,163
I'm not sure because
I really don't know

58
00:07:34,356 --> 00:07:36,163
and I really don't want to find out
with the two of you in the car.

59
00:07:37,203 --> 00:07:38,658
Everybody hold on.

60
00:08:02,693 --> 00:08:04,543
I think they shot the tires.

61
00:08:06,064 --> 00:08:06,912
What?

62
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,426
- Oh my God!
- We gonna have to make a run for it.

63
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,152
Run.

64
00:08:16,818 --> 00:08:17,729
Come on!

65
00:08:30,785 --> 00:08:32,109
Go!
Go!

66
00:08:44,188 --> 00:08:45,916
Go back.

67
00:09:36,586 --> 00:09:38,163
It's a dead end,
it's a dead end.

68
00:09:39,487 --> 00:09:40,952
Now everybody get out.

69
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,074
Go, go!

70
00:09:45,027 --> 00:09:45,872
come on!

71
00:09:59,083 --> 00:09:59,890
Go! Go!

72
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:03,111
Hurry.

73
00:10:14,762 --> 00:10:16,133
Dr Kelvin!

74
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:21,290
What are you doing with nuclear weapons?

75
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,402
Dr Kelvin?

76
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,656
What is he talking about?

77
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:26,917
What?

78
00:10:29,522 --> 00:10:30,977
In the last year...

79
00:10:31,738 --> 00:10:33,541
you have made 7 trips...

80
00:10:34,076 --> 00:10:36,273
to the International Space Station,

81
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,733
armed with bombs.

82
00:10:40,346 --> 00:10:41,360
Why?

83
00:10:51,096 --> 00:10:53,397
Okay.
You gotta run, okay?

84
00:10:54,026 --> 00:10:56,777
- We're all in danger, the whole world!
- Yes, by your actions.

85
00:11:01,671 --> 00:11:03,286
Mr Kelvin?

86
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:05,239
Professor Kelvin?

87
00:11:05,614 --> 00:11:08,375
- There is one more!
- Henreaux?

88
00:11:11,585 --> 00:11:12,731
Henreaux?

89
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,003
What took you so long?

90
00:11:20,017 --> 00:11:21,810
We got here as quick as we could, sir.

91
00:11:44,384 --> 00:11:45,802
Don't worry, Mrs. Kelvin.

92
00:11:46,102 --> 00:11:49,220
I have agents taking care of you and your
daughter before this project is finished.

93
00:11:50,253 --> 00:11:51,961
I'll make all the arrangements myself.

94
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,100
Get them to the base.
They'll be safe there

95
00:11:54,201 --> 00:11:55,100
Yes, sir.

96
00:11:58,659 --> 00:12:01,044
I can't believe we were in danger
and you didn't tell us.

97
00:12:01,926 --> 00:12:02,762
I didn't know.

98
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,791
Honestly.

99
00:12:07,444 --> 00:12:09,707
Nobody outside the project
was supposed to know anything.

100
00:12:09,827 --> 00:12:11,772
Well baby, obviously somebody found out.

101
00:12:14,226 --> 00:12:15,090
I just...

102
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,221
I just...

103
00:12:18,545 --> 00:12:19,846
How long..?
Tell me when it's gonna be over

104
00:12:19,945 --> 00:12:20,846
and when we're gonna be safe?

105
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:24,412
A month.

106
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,806
One month.

107
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:29,576
One way or another
it'll all be over, I promise.

108
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:31,932
Okay.

109
00:12:36,681 --> 00:12:37,538
Mam'!

110
00:12:38,596 --> 00:12:41,075
I am Agent Green
This is my partner agent Dunne.

111
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,676
- We have a car waiting.
- Okay.

112
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:57,247
Mam’!
Sir!

113
00:12:57,914 --> 00:12:58,881
Catch ya!

114
00:13:09,886 --> 00:13:11,745
My wife, my daughter, myself...

115
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:14,205
whatever these guys found out from my side,
would have killed us afterwards.

116
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,198
You know, it's one thing for
me to put my life on the line.

117
00:13:16,318 --> 00:13:19,090
Whoever inside the project leaked the
information out, we'll plug the leak.

118
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,803
Well please do it before it gets more out
of hand, before it gets out to the public.

119
00:13:21,923 --> 00:13:23,559
before it causes worldwide panic.

120
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:24,531
Professor Kelvin!

121
00:13:24,551 --> 00:13:27,001
Capt. James Moto, Air Force office of
Special Investigations.

122
00:13:27,021 --> 00:13:27,883
Hi.

123
00:13:27,903 --> 00:13:29,536
I've been assigned to go through your
computer systems,

124
00:13:29,656 --> 00:13:32,550
emails, IM's, blog posts, you know
anything containing information ways.

125
00:13:32,898 --> 00:13:34,982
You know enough about the project,
to know what you're looking for?

126
00:13:36,045 --> 00:13:38,458
Well, yeah, I know that the
small burst of radiation

127
00:13:38,578 --> 00:13:39,974
that have been hitting planet Earth,
the past couple of years,

128
00:13:39,994 --> 00:13:43,416
is supposed to be prelude to a full
blast supernova that's coming in over us.

129
00:13:43,707 --> 00:13:45,115
<i>Not supposed to be about it.</i>

130
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:48,261
Based on analysis we've been
getting the Spitzer Space Telescope,

131
00:13:48,381 --> 00:13:51,416
there's gonna be enough gamma radiation
for a planet-killing catastrophe.

132
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,970
I need to go check on the space platform.

133
00:13:55,854 --> 00:13:57,159
The climate will go haywire.

134
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,074
Everything controlled by
electricity will be fried.

135
00:13:59,194 --> 00:14:01,272
Communications, water and you name it...

136
00:14:01,392 --> 00:14:03,328
The earth will turn into
a radioactive wasteland.

137
00:14:03,448 --> 00:14:05,929
That's how long we have
until the blast hits us.

138
00:14:08,811 --> 00:14:10,303
And there is nothing that can
be done to stop it.

139
00:14:10,423 --> 00:14:12,642
That's what this project is all about.

140
00:14:14,163 --> 00:14:16,491
Another hand to help us
with our calculations?

141
00:14:16,611 --> 00:14:18,913
Capt. Moto, Professor Huan Ye of China.

142
00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:20,707
The People's Republic of China.

143
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,951
Professor Dzerzhinsky of Russia.

144
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,063
The People's Republic of Vodka.

145
00:14:28,252 --> 00:14:33,275
Ye and I have been going over the
calculations, for nuclear missile launches.

146
00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:37,858
and I think that we will have to alter
each launch by a few milliseconds,

147
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:40,968
in order for pattern to sustain cloud.

148
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:44,460
We have to re-program the US missile
launch codes in order to

149
00:14:44,561 --> 00:14:45,860
match the timing of ours.

150
00:14:46,508 --> 00:14:48,621
Or you could just let us do it.

151
00:14:50,036 --> 00:14:52,506
I'm sure my government would be about
as happy about that as yours would.

152
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:54,703
Message me the new codes.

153
00:14:55,081 --> 00:14:56,386
What a shame.

154
00:14:56,506 --> 00:14:59,691
With so much at stake, you'd think we could
make decisions that

155
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:02,123
would benefit our own mutual interest.

156
00:15:02,243 --> 00:15:05,597
Perhaps it's in all our mutual
interest that we study all the data,

157
00:15:06,283 --> 00:15:08,170
and make our decision based on that.

158
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:10,931
- Touché!
- I don't care.

159
00:15:11,174 --> 00:15:12,928
I just hope that when
we launch those nukes

160
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:15,728
that the cloud shield will protect the Earth
as much as possible.

161
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:34,580
Magnetosphere is earth's natural barrier
against radiation.

162
00:15:34,927 --> 00:15:37,378
But our data show that the
incoming radiation would be too strong

163
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,378
for the magnetosphere to handle, so...

164
00:15:40,054 --> 00:15:42,101
we're gonna help mother nature out.

165
00:15:42,221 --> 00:15:44,593
There are two schools of thought
on where to explode the nukes.

166
00:15:44,713 --> 00:15:47,316
Inside the magnetosphere
and outside the magnetosphere.

167
00:15:47,616 --> 00:15:49,531
Honestly, unless we can't
get more nukes up there,

168
00:15:49,757 --> 00:15:51,691
neither of these plans are gonna cut it.

169
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:56,142
Let me ask you a question.

170
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,832
You trust these guys?

171
00:15:59,968 --> 00:16:01,292
I have to.

172
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:09,182
we're all gonna be up on that space platform
together controlling the missile launches.

173
00:16:11,631 --> 00:16:13,396
I wish we could launch them from down here,

174
00:16:14,401 --> 00:16:15,271
But...

175
00:16:15,528 --> 00:16:18,063
without the earth's
gravitational pull we can...

176
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,983
pinpoint the launches right
where we want them and...

177
00:16:21,885 --> 00:16:23,143
and detonate them more quickly.

178
00:16:23,592 --> 00:16:26,644
What happens if one the bursts
fries the platform's electronics?

179
00:16:28,033 --> 00:16:29,564
Well...

180
00:16:31,754 --> 00:16:34,562
We've had them retro-fitted
with radiation shield,

181
00:16:35,426 --> 00:16:37,491
like we did on the space shuttle, so...

182
00:16:39,388 --> 00:16:40,956
let’s hope that doesn't happen.

183
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,196
Where is it?

184
00:16:47,216 --> 00:16:48,078
Mrs. Kelvin?

185
00:16:48,098 --> 00:16:49,991
Tina, are you sure you haven't seen it,
I thought you had it last.

186
00:16:50,111 --> 00:16:51,137
I can't remember.

187
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:52,588
Mrs. Kelvin?

188
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,185
It gotta be here somewhere.

189
00:16:54,786 --> 00:16:56,682
- Ms. Kelvin?
- What?

190
00:16:57,302 --> 00:16:59,424
I'm not leaving here without
her mom's necklace, okay?

191
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,181
Mrs. Kelvin?
What?

192
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:04,135
We did you the courtesy
of coming back here.

193
00:17:04,464 --> 00:17:07,450
We are on a tight timetable and
we need to escort you to base.

194
00:17:08,239 --> 00:17:09,115
Now.

195
00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:10,276
10 more minutes.

196
00:17:10,736 --> 00:17:11,563
and we're leaving.

197
00:17:17,047 --> 00:17:20,406
Your father told me he hid it in some
stupid hiding place that only he knows.

198
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,509
You know, you really need
to cut him some slack.

199
00:17:29,894 --> 00:17:32,232
He has some pretty big
things on his mind.

200
00:17:36,149 --> 00:17:37,041
You're right.

201
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,782
Will you help me look?

202
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,660
And there you go my man, Gin.

203
00:17:53,356 --> 00:17:55,009
Oh, come on.

204
00:17:55,129 --> 00:17:57,600
You know you'll need male
equipments to be an astronaut.

205
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,445
Funny, funny, funny.

206
00:18:03,055 --> 00:18:05,505
Okay, they're loading the nuclear
warhead on the shuttle now.

207
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,261
This is it.
The last one.

208
00:18:09,111 --> 00:18:11,261
Let us do our part
to save the world again.

209
00:18:24,906 --> 00:18:26,004
Let me see.

210
00:18:26,718 --> 00:18:28,192
For the nuclear cloud shield

211
00:18:28,577 --> 00:18:31,863
to be strong enough to last this,
the entire supernova burst,

212
00:18:32,622 --> 00:18:34,782
we should have more
warheads that we thought.

213
00:18:34,902 --> 00:18:35,956
You're right.

214
00:18:36,444 --> 00:18:38,331
I wish that we had more.

215
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,726
But, given the time constraint
that we have and

216
00:18:40,923 --> 00:18:44,426
the fact that we only have 3 shuttles
to carry everything to the platform, I...

217
00:18:45,196 --> 00:18:46,144
Yes.

218
00:18:48,022 --> 00:18:48,895
Yes.

219
00:18:50,006 --> 00:18:53,815
I just wish we had
one more load of

220
00:18:54,372 --> 00:18:55,987
of nuclear warheads.

221
00:18:57,555 --> 00:18:58,485
Up there.

222
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:01,669
Because, at this point,

223
00:19:02,936 --> 00:19:06,251
every shuttle, especially this last one,

224
00:19:06,918 --> 00:19:12,592
will make a difference, as to whether
our little nuclear shield will...

225
00:19:13,662 --> 00:19:16,817
protect the whole earth, or not.

226
00:19:17,378 --> 00:19:18,270
Look, I know,

227
00:19:18,514 --> 00:19:21,585
but we're just gonna do the best with
what we've got and hope that it works.

228
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:28,892
<i>A massive earthquake has triggered
an infamous volcano</i>

229
00:19:29,012 --> 00:19:30,798
<i>in Italy, back into activity.</i>

230
00:19:31,418 --> 00:19:35,662
<i>Now, two thousand years later, Mount
Vesuvius has reared its head once again,</i>

231
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:39,719
<i>burying hundreds of square
kilometers in ash and pumice.</i>

232
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:53,697
Guess what I found?

233
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:55,265
Thanks.

234
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:01,959
What's wrong, sweetie?

235
00:20:03,687 --> 00:20:04,926
Are you kidding me?

236
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:08,588
We almost got murdered this morning
and now we are supposed to

237
00:20:08,598 --> 00:20:10,698
get in the car and go right back into it?

238
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,053
I know, I just...

239
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:17,048
I don't know what else to do...

240
00:20:19,457 --> 00:20:21,494
Why can't he just stay here with us?

241
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,724
Why can't he just be here?

242
00:20:26,953 --> 00:20:28,840
Sweetheart, it's just
like you said, it's just...

243
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:32,784
He's got a lot on his plate right now.

244
00:20:36,326 --> 00:20:37,894
She'd know what to do.

245
00:20:39,995 --> 00:20:40,795
Yeah.

246
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:43,330
I know she would.

247
00:21:04,026 --> 00:21:06,213
- When is it gonna stop?
- Let's just hold on.

248
00:21:08,331 --> 00:21:09,720
Let's go!
Let's go!

249
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,485
Come on, get the two. Let's get out of here.

250
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:12,462
Come on.

251
00:21:33,802 --> 00:21:35,201
From here on out,

252
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:37,577
stronger energy bursts are
going to hit earth and

253
00:21:37,868 --> 00:21:40,019
and worse it will beget.

254
00:21:45,774 --> 00:21:46,948
The shuttle.

255
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,443
<i>Please tell me the platform
is intact.</i>

256
00:21:57,304 --> 00:22:00,149
<i>I'm sorry, Dr. Kelvin, but I'm not
sure we're gonna be able to launch it.</i>

257
00:22:01,149 --> 00:22:03,252
There could be problems
launch structure now.

258
00:22:04,837 --> 00:22:06,321
We don't have any other choice,

259
00:22:06,441 --> 00:22:07,735
Those warheads have to
get up on the platform

260
00:22:07,745 --> 00:22:08,745
or parts of the earth are gonna go

261
00:22:08,864 --> 00:22:11,298
unprotected and destroyed by radiation.

262
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:13,805
Okay, I'll have the structure
gone over again, but...

263
00:22:13,925 --> 00:22:16,541
I know, I know,
everyone is aware of the risk.

264
00:22:17,114 --> 00:22:18,297
<i>Please do it.</i>

265
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:20,767
I'll find out when the
after-shocks are gonna hit, so

266
00:22:20,887 --> 00:22:22,344
we can schedule the
next launch.

267
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,668
Alright, good, thanks. I...

268
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:25,769
I gotta take
care of something else now.

269
00:22:47,015 --> 00:22:47,829
Ryan?

270
00:22:48,752 --> 00:22:50,207
Thank God.

271
00:22:52,452 --> 00:22:53,813
Yeah, we are okay.

272
00:22:56,435 --> 00:22:58,867
The house was destroyed in the
earthquake.

273
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,224
No, no, we're okay.

274
00:23:05,225 --> 00:23:07,178
Yeah, we are on our way there now.

275
00:23:09,581 --> 00:23:12,154
Agents are right in front of us.
They are keeping an eye on us.

276
00:23:14,354 --> 00:23:16,438
Good, good, just...

277
00:23:16,889 --> 00:23:18,758
do what they tell you and
everything will be alright.

278
00:23:19,706 --> 00:23:21,434
Okay, I will.

279
00:23:23,255 --> 00:23:24,354
I love you too.

280
00:23:46,302 --> 00:23:47,363
Brace yourself.

281
00:23:47,795 --> 00:23:48,950
Look out!

282
00:24:24,772 --> 00:24:26,875
The tremors feel like they...

283
00:24:29,626 --> 00:24:30,743
Is it over?

284
00:24:33,401 --> 00:24:34,359
I think so.

285
00:24:41,364 --> 00:24:42,463
<i>Laura.</i>

286
00:24:43,778 --> 00:24:44,607
Ryan!

287
00:24:44,894 --> 00:24:47,138
What happened...? Laura?

288
00:24:49,514 --> 00:24:50,365
Ryan!

289
00:24:52,415 --> 00:24:54,481
Ryan!
Ryan!

290
00:24:55,998 --> 00:24:57,462
I can hardly hear you.

291
00:24:59,284 --> 00:25:00,298
Oh my God!

292
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,185
- Professor Kelvin?
- I'm sorry, what?

293
00:25:16,543 --> 00:25:18,515
The next after-shock won't hit for hours.

294
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,350
I spoke with NASA,
and they Okayed the launch structure so

295
00:25:21,594 --> 00:25:23,031
they're gonna go ahead as scheduled.

296
00:25:24,092 --> 00:25:24,965
Good.

297
00:25:25,998 --> 00:25:28,173
Let’s pray nothing else happens
between now and then.

298
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,813
Sir!

299
00:25:40,668 --> 00:25:41,541
What is it?

300
00:25:42,198 --> 00:25:44,912
We're picking up a major
surge in energy particles

301
00:25:45,316 --> 00:25:47,259
about to reach the earth's atmosphere.

302
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,097
That's almost four hours
ahead of our calculations.

303
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,266
We have to get a hold of
launch control and see if

304
00:25:52,276 --> 00:25:53,276
there's any way we could
stop them from launching.

305
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:56,745
If the shipments of warheads
doesn't make it up there...

306
00:25:56,865 --> 00:25:59,770
we won't have enough to protect
us against the full supernova burst.

307
00:26:00,352 --> 00:26:02,117
It's not much we can do about it now.

308
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,836
The launch is a GO in... 3,

309
00:26:04,561 --> 00:26:05,744
2, 1...

310
00:26:37,686 --> 00:26:39,094
Mission Control?

311
00:26:39,921 --> 00:26:41,639
Mission Control, can you read me?

312
00:26:43,404 --> 00:26:45,291
Mission Control, please respond!

313
00:27:18,247 --> 00:27:20,040
That flight had to happen.

314
00:27:21,064 --> 00:27:22,932
We needed those warheads.

315
00:27:27,484 --> 00:27:29,709
We have to re-compute
the missile launch pattern.

316
00:27:30,076 --> 00:27:33,090
Now that we don't have as many
as we need.

317
00:27:37,402 --> 00:27:38,764
Let's get an uplink.

318
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:42,238
I'll run a full diagnostic to see if
there's any damage on the platform.

319
00:27:45,921 --> 00:27:48,052
That is if the energy
burst will let us through.

320
00:27:49,132 --> 00:27:52,296
I will re-check energy burst,

321
00:27:53,554 --> 00:27:55,329
to try to figure out...

322
00:27:55,878 --> 00:27:58,555
why we were so far off in calculating speed.

323
00:28:13,611 --> 00:28:14,644
Dr. Kelvin.

324
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:16,312
What?

325
00:28:18,942 --> 00:28:21,647
Based on our newest data...

326
00:28:23,111 --> 00:28:24,933
that we are getting now, our...

327
00:28:25,053 --> 00:28:27,806
our calculations on
when the supernova will arrive

328
00:28:27,926 --> 00:28:31,591
are off by more than 24 hours.

329
00:28:43,427 --> 00:28:44,357
Jesus!

330
00:28:44,836 --> 00:28:47,193
But that could change,

331
00:28:48,257 --> 00:28:50,764
it could get shorter, if the...

332
00:28:50,884 --> 00:28:54,830
stronger blast that comes right before the
supernova is moving faster than we think.

333
00:28:57,161 --> 00:29:00,532
And I think we should take another look
at where we are going to do the explosions,

334
00:29:00,785 --> 00:29:02,503
inside or outside magnetosphere.

335
00:29:03,405 --> 00:29:05,264
You know my feelings on this and
the reason I believe we need

336
00:29:05,365 --> 00:29:06,964
to create the shield outside it.

337
00:29:07,469 --> 00:29:10,045
Yes, but I just did a
new computer simulation of

338
00:29:10,055 --> 00:29:11,855
the nuclear explosions with fewer warheads,

339
00:29:12,614 --> 00:29:14,897
and molecules will stay more
tightly bound together

340
00:29:14,998 --> 00:29:17,497
if the explosions occur
inside the magnetosphere.

341
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,764
Not outside, it won't
be as effective.

342
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:22,553
And if we explode the warheads
inside the magnetosphere,

343
00:29:22,673 --> 00:29:24,479
we run the chance of destroying
the earth's atmosphere.

344
00:29:24,999 --> 00:29:27,595
changing the climate and destroying
this planet as we know it.

345
00:29:28,191 --> 00:29:29,393
Oh please.

346
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:32,379
I think we need to concentrate
on the immediate threat.

347
00:29:33,957 --> 00:29:34,961
The supernova.

348
00:29:35,365 --> 00:29:38,548
We can't just trade off one form of
the earth being destroyed for another.

349
00:29:38,668 --> 00:29:40,441
That's only if we accept your theory.

350
00:29:40,561 --> 00:29:42,948
You do not know what will
happen anymore than I do.

351
00:29:50,764 --> 00:29:51,966
Got a second?

352
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,438
I've been running through all
the internet traffic

353
00:30:14,448 --> 00:30:16,048
in and out here for the
past couple of days,

354
00:30:17,002 --> 00:30:19,030
I found that someone sent out a message

355
00:30:19,546 --> 00:30:20,983
to a blind email account.

356
00:30:26,321 --> 00:30:27,796
Professor Ryan Kelvin is
the one in charge of

357
00:30:27,897 --> 00:30:30,097
putting nuclear weapons into
space for the U.S. government.

358
00:30:33,001 --> 00:30:36,513
It's no wonder that the Iranians came after
me. Any idea who signed in to this computer?

359
00:30:37,104 --> 00:30:38,015
You did.

360
00:30:40,156 --> 00:30:42,193
Or someone using
your name and password.

361
00:30:43,694 --> 00:30:44,952
Look, somebody’s being smart.

362
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,858
Is there any way that I, when I...

363
00:30:47,243 --> 00:30:50,971
my username signs in to use a program
that we attach a voice ID and a password?

364
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,104
Sure, no problem.

365
00:30:53,367 --> 00:30:55,114
- Take care of yourself.
- Oh,

366
00:30:56,663 --> 00:30:58,334
One oth... I mean if you can...

367
00:31:00,334 --> 00:31:03,614
I've been trying to get a hold of my wife
all day and it's just nothing but static.

368
00:31:03,734 --> 00:31:06,937
I can use a signal booster and
see if that will do the trick.

369
00:31:07,388 --> 00:31:09,491
Thanks... 'cause I'm just...
with the earthquake I...

370
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,833
Don't worry about it,
I'm on it right now

371
00:31:12,491 --> 00:31:13,545
Okay?

372
00:31:46,073 --> 00:31:47,050
It's stuck.

373
00:31:49,754 --> 00:31:51,153
The links are probably down.

374
00:31:53,294 --> 00:31:54,383
Just an after-shock.

375
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:00,720
Hello!

376
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,687
Got it.

377
00:32:05,242 --> 00:32:06,077
Laura?

378
00:32:08,622 --> 00:32:10,950
Thank God, I've been trying
get through to you.

379
00:32:11,927 --> 00:32:15,016
The agents were killed
in the earthquake.

380
00:32:15,371 --> 00:32:17,662
<i>Where are you?
You're still on your way, right?</i>

381
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:20,838
We're trying to get
to the air base but

382
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,204
the bridge is blocked so
we can't get through.

383
00:32:23,777 --> 00:32:25,054
You okay?

384
00:32:26,476 --> 00:32:27,321
Are you sure?

385
00:32:28,706 --> 00:32:31,222
Yeah, I'm worried, I've been
trying to get a hold of you.

386
00:32:33,241 --> 00:32:36,199
Maybe you shouldn't try to meet me here.

387
00:32:38,851 --> 00:32:41,415
I don't know what to do.
We can't keep driving.

388
00:32:41,734 --> 00:32:45,302
No, what I was thinking is,
maybe you'd meet me at Patterson.

389
00:32:46,206 --> 00:32:48,613
There is an underground secure
facility there, it's where all the...

390
00:32:49,313 --> 00:32:51,536
shuttle launch computers are,
where all the NASA higher-ups are going

391
00:32:51,546 --> 00:32:53,446
because we had it special radiation treated.

392
00:32:55,262 --> 00:32:56,848
Meet me at the fall out okay?

393
00:32:57,693 --> 00:32:58,523
So,

394
00:32:59,365 --> 00:33:00,848
We heard on the news about,

395
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,797
the supernova, that's true?

396
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,236
Yes.

397
00:33:10,001 --> 00:33:12,480
Me not talking to you the last few years...

398
00:33:15,015 --> 00:33:16,189
<i>I couldn't.</i>

399
00:33:18,556 --> 00:33:21,429
There's something else I want to talk to
you about, but not on the phone, okay?

400
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:26,424
Meet me at the fallout shelter.

401
00:33:27,042 --> 00:33:27,952
Okay, hum.

402
00:33:29,286 --> 00:33:31,398
Tell them to expect us, okay?

403
00:33:32,629 --> 00:33:34,028
Baby, I love you.

404
00:33:34,553 --> 00:33:35,802
I love you too.

405
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:50,098
When they get to the gates
they're gonna use his name.

406
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:54,445
What I want you to do is assign them a
secure living quarter until he gets there.

407
00:33:58,154 --> 00:33:59,112
You're a good man.

408
00:33:59,563 --> 00:34:03,009
I got it setup now, so any time your
password logs onto a computer,

409
00:34:03,129 --> 00:34:05,309
somebody's gonna need to
register a voice command

410
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:06,419
before the computer does anything.

411
00:34:08,711 --> 00:34:10,439
One less thing to worry about.

412
00:34:29,057 --> 00:34:30,465
Laura, look out!

413
00:35:08,342 --> 00:35:10,051
Who taught you how to drive?

414
00:35:27,164 --> 00:35:28,855
The heat is really climbing.

415
00:35:42,156 --> 00:35:44,118
I can't believe that
storm caught up to us.

416
00:35:45,423 --> 00:35:46,991
Get in, let's get outta here.

417
00:36:08,101 --> 00:36:09,453
It keeps getting closer.

418
00:36:09,904 --> 00:36:10,927
I know.

419
00:36:12,267 --> 00:36:14,164
I've never seen clouds
move so fast.

420
00:36:30,527 --> 00:36:31,400
Look out!

421
00:36:40,358 --> 00:36:41,269
Laura!

422
00:36:43,658 --> 00:36:46,250
Okay, don't touch anything. Any Metal
will be electrified.

423
00:36:48,682 --> 00:36:51,245
It's okay.
I think we'll be alright.

424
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,933
The cab's like a Faraday cage,

425
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,543
Thank God the windows are rolled up.

426
00:36:57,463 --> 00:36:59,604
The electricity will find a
way to the ground in a second.

427
00:37:00,898 --> 00:37:02,663
You are your father’s daughter aren't you?

428
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,766
The Faraday's cage isn't enclosed anymore.

429
00:37:23,484 --> 00:37:24,498
It means...

430
00:37:24,968 --> 00:37:26,949
That electricity can get us now.

431
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,897
Alright, uh...

432
00:37:31,111 --> 00:37:33,289
Maybe we can get a ride.
Get out.

433
00:37:35,514 --> 00:37:36,406
Now.

434
00:37:48,855 --> 00:37:51,437
We have to get away from the car,
it will attract the lightning.

435
00:37:51,557 --> 00:37:53,427
Alright, go there!
Go!

436
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:58,704
Stay away from trees!
They attract lightning the most!

437
00:37:59,672 --> 00:38:01,127
Remind me to thank your father...

438
00:38:02,846 --> 00:38:03,822
Oh God!

439
00:38:04,066 --> 00:38:07,662
Even if the lightning doesn't get us,
one of those feelers still could.

440
00:38:07,888 --> 00:38:09,578
We're gonna be okay.
We're gonna be okay.

441
00:38:36,713 --> 00:38:38,018
Oh God, Laura!

442
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:39,135
Come on!

443
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:21,134
Great, the launch computers on
the platforms are not responding.

444
00:39:21,914 --> 00:39:23,191
We can't get through to them?

445
00:39:23,311 --> 00:39:26,055
I can communicate with other systems,
onboard, just not those.

446
00:39:27,163 --> 00:39:30,750
It's a good thing we have
back-ups that is functioning, right?

447
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,122
Don't we?

448
00:39:34,951 --> 00:39:36,726
I'll go over it to make
sure that it is,

449
00:39:36,846 --> 00:39:38,613
but it has to gonna come onboard
with us on the shuttle.

450
00:39:38,733 --> 00:39:40,642
Wait, it needs to be
programmed with the latest data.

451
00:39:40,762 --> 00:39:42,283
And you have to run
that test-fire simulation

452
00:39:42,293 --> 00:39:43,993
to make sure of its launch capabilities.

453
00:39:45,121 --> 00:39:49,816
The speed of the energy burst,
is increasingly hitting us,

454
00:39:50,567 --> 00:39:53,337
means that the launch computer
will have to reconfigure

455
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:57,572
time, space and location
of missile launches,

456
00:39:58,717 --> 00:40:01,206
and destination, second by second.

457
00:40:05,401 --> 00:40:08,715
We are almost just guessing how
fast the supernova is really moving,

458
00:40:08,835 --> 00:40:10,753
until it is right about to hit us.

459
00:40:25,152 --> 00:40:25,969
Moto?

460
00:40:27,434 --> 00:40:30,204
I'm gonna be down at A-13,
Do me a favor, will you?

461
00:40:31,265 --> 00:40:32,918
Keep trying to get a hold of my wife.

462
00:40:38,273 --> 00:40:40,809
Kelvin Ryan, project head.

463
00:40:51,044 --> 00:40:52,786
Are all the electric power turned
on to the platform mark-up?

464
00:40:52,796 --> 00:40:53,796
Yes, sir.

465
00:40:54,002 --> 00:40:55,307
I heard that you had
a problem.

466
00:40:56,165 --> 00:40:59,282
It kind of makes me wonder if God
wants us interfering with his plans!

467
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:03,442
Right now I wonder how the grapevine
around here knows about mine.

468
00:41:23,369 --> 00:41:24,599
Okay.

469
00:41:43,629 --> 00:41:45,939
Come on, baby, I don't
need any more problems now.

470
00:42:07,181 --> 00:42:09,049
Let's check the control panel.

471
00:42:22,254 --> 00:42:24,113
Great. At least the
emergency system works.

472
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:43,839
Kelvin!

473
00:44:01,049 --> 00:44:01,904
Kelvin.

474
00:44:04,035 --> 00:44:04,917
Kelvin!

475
00:44:07,197 --> 00:44:08,020
Fuck.

476
00:45:11,492 --> 00:45:12,985
Kelvin, it's me, Henreaux!

477
00:45:14,168 --> 00:45:15,671
Come on, sit down!

478
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:19,936
You okay?

479
00:45:24,696 --> 00:45:26,330
You got any idea
who attacked you?

480
00:45:28,531 --> 00:45:29,695
No, just...

481
00:45:30,502 --> 00:45:31,723
what they were after, just...

482
00:45:32,709 --> 00:45:35,695
someone dressed in black, and kicked
my ass in a real professional way.

483
00:45:43,245 --> 00:45:44,710
How long was I out?

484
00:45:46,306 --> 00:45:47,527
20 minutes, maybe.

485
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:49,252
If someone wanted to sabotage this project

486
00:45:49,262 --> 00:45:51,162
they could have destroyed
this with the replacing panel.

487
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:53,011
Or they just wanted
to get rid of you.

488
00:45:54,898 --> 00:45:56,692
It's gotta be someone
inside this project.

489
00:45:57,112 --> 00:45:58,361
But after what?

490
00:45:59,093 --> 00:46:00,293
There's been no unauthorized access,

491
00:46:00,303 --> 00:46:02,303
but I'm cross-checking the
password and log-in now.

492
00:46:03,882 --> 00:46:05,065
Where's Motto?

493
00:46:06,962 --> 00:46:07,863
He's dead.

494
00:46:09,213 --> 00:46:12,453
He came looking for you with a message but
he ran into your man in black instead.

495
00:46:13,551 --> 00:46:14,365
Jesus!

496
00:46:15,936 --> 00:46:16,822
Dead?

497
00:46:36,586 --> 00:46:38,125
It is desperate.

498
00:46:39,019 --> 00:46:40,841
Do whatever you can.

499
00:46:41,376 --> 00:46:42,625
Yes.
Goodbye.

500
00:46:47,977 --> 00:46:49,076
Where is Ye?

501
00:46:53,137 --> 00:46:54,658
Did the simulation work?

502
00:46:56,499 --> 00:46:58,377
You both been here the
whole time since I left?

503
00:47:03,345 --> 00:47:05,880
I was gone a few minutes to
pick up some sandwiches, but...

504
00:47:06,293 --> 00:47:07,899
Why? Didn't Moto find you?

505
00:47:10,841 --> 00:47:12,052
You saw Moto?

506
00:47:12,418 --> 00:47:13,667
He was here.

507
00:47:14,033 --> 00:47:15,911
He was looking for you. He said...

508
00:47:16,972 --> 00:47:21,019
your wife called and that
she needed your help.

509
00:47:21,847 --> 00:47:22,852
Desperately.

510
00:47:25,434 --> 00:47:28,852
Time is growing... shorter.

511
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:01,370
It looks like the lightning stopped.

512
00:48:03,268 --> 00:48:04,461
For right now.

513
00:48:05,803 --> 00:48:07,249
How are we gonna get to the base?

514
00:48:11,512 --> 00:48:12,320
Howdy.

515
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:14,085
You all get lost?

516
00:48:14,972 --> 00:48:17,441
All 'em fire is burning
because of the heat and lightning.

517
00:48:20,145 --> 00:48:22,868
Hey, do you happen to have a phone
we can use?

518
00:48:23,394 --> 00:48:24,371
Sure do.

519
00:48:24,491 --> 00:48:25,804
If it's still working.

520
00:48:32,997 --> 00:48:34,020
This heat.

521
00:48:35,261 --> 00:48:38,707
The two of you must be pretty desperate
to get somewhere to be out in this on foot.

522
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:40,885
We had a car.

523
00:48:41,486 --> 00:48:42,669
But the storm...

524
00:48:43,855 --> 00:48:46,831
We're trying to get to my dad
before he takes off on the space shuttle.

525
00:48:47,939 --> 00:48:49,686
He's working on that big project?

526
00:48:51,857 --> 00:48:52,680
Ryan?

527
00:48:54,655 --> 00:48:55,462
<i>Laura?</i>

528
00:48:56,204 --> 00:48:58,251
Where are you?
Why haven't you gotten to Patterson yet?

529
00:48:59,434 --> 00:49:00,235
What?

530
00:49:01,008 --> 00:49:02,313
Listen, we're...

531
00:49:03,693 --> 00:49:05,600
we're okay, for right now, but

532
00:49:06,557 --> 00:49:08,257
I don't know if we're gonna
make it to Patterson.

533
00:49:09,393 --> 00:49:10,830
I'm coming to get you guys.

534
00:49:11,027 --> 00:49:11,891
No.

535
00:49:11,938 --> 00:49:14,896
Baby, You can't leave
project now.

536
00:49:15,966 --> 00:49:17,234
Look, I have to see you.

537
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,746
Baby, I want to see you too.

538
00:49:23,973 --> 00:49:26,451
More than anything, but...

539
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:31,306
Listen, I know that you have
to do what you're doing.

540
00:49:33,109 --> 00:49:34,903
<i>Okay? You have a job to do, and...</i>

541
00:49:36,846 --> 00:49:39,382
there's too much at stake for
you should leave now.

542
00:49:39,813 --> 00:49:42,236
I can't leave you out
there unprotected, Laura.

543
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:45,590
Somehow we'll...
we'll be fine.

544
00:49:45,956 --> 00:49:47,083
Really.

545
00:49:48,182 --> 00:49:51,581
You know that cave that we
went exploring out during our vacation?

546
00:49:52,047 --> 00:49:54,197
We'll go in there,
there'll be protection.

547
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,535
We'll be fine.

548
00:49:56,901 --> 00:49:57,897
Honey...

549
00:50:00,244 --> 00:50:01,962
I haven't told you my part.

550
00:50:05,927 --> 00:50:08,706
It's up on the space platform
launching the missiles.

551
00:50:11,648 --> 00:50:15,394
<i>If any part of the supernova burst
makes it trough the platform, it won't...</i>

552
00:50:20,636 --> 00:50:23,237
Look honey, if I haven't
told you enough lately or...

553
00:50:25,936 --> 00:50:27,288
if you ever doubted...

554
00:50:30,993 --> 00:50:31,922
I know, baby.

555
00:50:33,734 --> 00:50:34,557
I know.

556
00:50:36,514 --> 00:50:38,148
I just want you to know,

557
00:50:38,688 --> 00:50:40,368
that I love you so much.

558
00:50:49,309 --> 00:50:50,342
Hi, Dad?

559
00:50:52,615 --> 00:50:53,554
Hey kiddo!

560
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:58,305
<i>Hey, uh...</i>

561
00:50:58,983 --> 00:51:00,711
if you guys can't make it to...

562
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:03,744
the base in the next couple of hours,
I need you to find...

563
00:51:03,864 --> 00:51:07,265
some deep cover, okay?
A mine shaft or a cave or something.

564
00:51:08,861 --> 00:51:09,661
<i>Understand?</i>

565
00:51:09,979 --> 00:51:12,158
Yeah, I will.
I will.

566
00:51:13,181 --> 00:51:14,590
I will do what can,

567
00:51:16,618 --> 00:51:18,843
but I need you and Laura
to find a safe spot, okay?

568
00:51:19,928 --> 00:51:20,754
Dad?

569
00:51:37,743 --> 00:51:39,743
You know, If you want to get to that cave,

570
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:42,739
it's not gonna be a good idea for
you to try it out on foot.

571
00:51:47,564 --> 00:51:49,658
That old truck of mine ain't much but,

572
00:51:49,778 --> 00:51:51,395
but it ought to get you there okay.

573
00:51:56,391 --> 00:51:57,348
What about you?

574
00:51:57,905 --> 00:51:59,717
Come with us, you're not
gonna be safe here.

575
00:52:00,722 --> 00:52:02,591
Where am I gonna go?

576
00:52:03,483 --> 00:52:05,135
I've lived here my whole life.

577
00:52:06,168 --> 00:52:07,154
I'll die here.

578
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:19,524
So this is the truck I was
telling you guys about.

579
00:52:19,644 --> 00:52:21,340
Thank you so much.

580
00:52:22,092 --> 00:52:22,971
No need.

581
00:52:23,221 --> 00:52:24,470
Glad to help.

582
00:52:24,874 --> 00:52:28,320
I was having a second idea here...

583
00:52:29,569 --> 00:52:31,860
I'm thinking maybe only one
of you should go.

584
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,110
I think maybe she should stay.

585
00:52:40,378 --> 00:52:41,232
Excuse me?

586
00:52:43,611 --> 00:52:46,203
There's no reason for
both of you to go, really,

587
00:52:46,944 --> 00:52:48,907
and I'd like for her to stay.

588
00:52:49,771 --> 00:52:51,620
Besides, for the weather, the way it is,

589
00:52:52,193 --> 00:52:53,958
Who knows if we even have tomorrow?

590
00:52:55,268 --> 00:52:56,404
So what do you say?

591
00:52:59,531 --> 00:53:02,179
I think maybe you and I could
really get to know each other.

592
00:53:43,522 --> 00:53:44,884
I'll call you back.

593
00:53:45,004 --> 00:53:46,893
Things bad or worse than expected?

594
00:53:47,013 --> 00:53:49,842
I just faced my own mortality a
little quicker that I wanted to.

595
00:53:49,852 --> 00:53:50,852
I'm not too
happy about that.

596
00:53:52,122 --> 00:53:53,624
How are you feeling physically?

597
00:53:53,889 --> 00:53:56,480
Look, I feel, like Atlas,
with the world on my shoulders,

598
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,283
only that the world is crushing me.

599
00:53:58,403 --> 00:54:01,063
I want the leak,
I want whoever killed Moto found

600
00:54:01,183 --> 00:54:04,236
Alright? Sweep the place.
Bugs, taps on my computer. Everything.

601
00:54:05,065 --> 00:54:06,220
Yes, sir.
Right away.

602
00:54:10,295 --> 00:54:11,807
We lost more time, huh?

603
00:54:12,088 --> 00:54:14,145
Based on the speed of this latest bursts...

604
00:54:14,473 --> 00:54:15,534
that's our new time.

605
00:54:15,778 --> 00:54:19,825
At this rate we will have to
make launch to space platform

606
00:54:19,945 --> 00:54:21,815
more quicker than I thought.

607
00:54:24,585 --> 00:54:26,031
A lot more quicker.

608
00:54:27,571 --> 00:54:30,303
Then I better finish the simulation
on that replacement panel.

609
00:54:35,324 --> 00:54:36,714
You trying to test 'em?

610
00:54:36,834 --> 00:54:39,380
When I'm in the platform mock-up
I want remote surveillance.

611
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,249
No security actually inside the hangar.

612
00:54:41,369 --> 00:54:44,000
So if someone wants to come after me,
and find something out, that's fine.

613
00:54:44,819 --> 00:54:48,378
We need to find out who they are,
and what they want as soon as possible.

614
00:54:48,498 --> 00:54:49,842
We're running out of time.

615
00:54:56,377 --> 00:54:58,649
Kelvin, Ryan, project head.

616
00:55:16,131 --> 00:55:17,793
It's like the apocalypse is coming.

617
00:55:19,474 --> 00:55:21,183
Wow, what's happening?

618
00:55:22,312 --> 00:55:25,815
The gust keep picking up,
it's like flying into a head wind.

619
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:30,021
How much longer 'til we get
to this cave we're going to?

620
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:32,793
We should be there by morning.

621
00:55:37,347 --> 00:55:38,840
I hope it's not that way.

622
00:55:43,185 --> 00:55:44,284
Oh my God!

623
00:55:56,554 --> 00:55:59,014
If we can't get off here,
we'll have to turn around.

624
00:56:02,622 --> 00:56:04,659
- Look out.
- I see it!

625
00:56:07,439 --> 00:56:09,458
Maybe we should do
what they're doing and...

626
00:56:09,578 --> 00:56:12,152
go back.
We can't go back that way. We'll be trapped.

627
00:56:12,834 --> 00:56:14,843
Okay, but do you see a cutoff or anything?
Look around.

628
00:56:14,963 --> 00:56:16,101
I'm looking, I'm looking.

629
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:18,768
- There, I can see...
- God!

630
00:56:24,458 --> 00:56:26,702
We're not gonna make it,
We're gonna make it.

631
00:56:29,651 --> 00:56:31,097
Put your head down.

632
00:56:58,991 --> 00:57:00,108
Let's get outta here.

633
00:57:00,521 --> 00:57:01,573
Let's go!

634
00:57:21,326 --> 00:57:22,255
Come on!

635
00:58:14,622 --> 00:58:15,758
No attacker.

636
00:58:16,143 --> 00:58:18,209
Well, we're not gonna
get another chance.

637
00:58:18,493 --> 00:58:21,028
We got the word to move you to
the shuttle launch site in one hour.

638
00:58:21,948 --> 00:58:24,389
It's the atmosphere.
It's getting more unstable by the hour.

639
00:58:25,272 --> 00:58:27,807
So if we don't go up now,
we might not make it to the platform?

640
00:58:28,561 --> 00:58:30,242
Any luck on getting a hold
on my wife and daughter?

641
00:58:30,362 --> 00:58:31,838
Sorry, too much
interference.

642
00:58:32,064 --> 00:58:34,815
Alright, you'd better pack up the
computer replacement panel.

643
00:58:35,087 --> 00:58:37,162
I'm gonna have a word
with Dzerzhinsky and Ye.

644
00:58:59,442 --> 00:59:00,972
Hey buddy, you okay?

645
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,822
- Yeah.
- You're gonna be fine.

646
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:06,848
That was a hell of an earthquake.
Bring a medical team down here, right away.

647
00:59:06,858 --> 00:59:08,058
Roger that.

648
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:09,038
Somebody's gonna be here.

649
00:59:09,585 --> 00:59:10,890
Just be calm.

650
00:59:13,998 --> 00:59:15,028
Doc, you can you
give me a hand?

651
00:59:15,038 --> 00:59:16,738
Yeah, let me put this case down,
I'll be right back.

652
00:59:21,783 --> 00:59:24,384
Kelvin Ryan, project head.

653
01:00:01,671 --> 01:00:03,717
- Are you alright?
- Where is Dzerzhinsky

654
01:00:04,046 --> 01:00:06,394
In the control room, we've been
getting ready to leave.

655
01:00:15,292 --> 01:00:16,334
Great!

656
01:00:17,245 --> 01:00:20,973
All those satellites giving
us data are gone,

657
01:00:21,093 --> 01:00:23,349
The only place to measure,

658
01:00:23,649 --> 01:00:26,382
speed of supernova, is platform.

659
01:00:26,502 --> 01:00:28,401
Hurry up; we gotta get ready to go.

660
01:00:29,819 --> 01:00:32,993
There is no telling how
short time we have...

661
01:00:33,387 --> 01:00:35,519
until the boom.

662
01:00:44,601 --> 01:00:45,953
Have you been here the whole time?

663
01:00:46,073 --> 01:00:49,005
Yes, I tried to get signal trough
to the platform but could not.

664
01:00:49,125 --> 01:00:52,340
- For all I know it might not be working.
- Wonderful.

665
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:13,188
- We've got problems!
- More?

666
01:01:13,516 --> 01:01:15,634
That earthquake was centered
30 km off the coast,

667
01:01:15,735 --> 01:01:16,934
it may have destroyed
the shuttle platform.

668
01:01:17,704 --> 01:01:19,159
Let us finish get packed up, just...

669
01:01:19,169 --> 01:01:21,869
get us some transportation.
- Right away.

670
01:01:44,006 --> 01:01:44,927
You okay?

671
01:01:47,124 --> 01:01:48,110
We did it.

672
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:53,134
Let's go, kiddo!

673
01:02:10,855 --> 01:02:12,451
Not beaten yet.

674
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:15,718
You think you can fix this?

675
01:02:15,838 --> 01:02:18,378
We'll see, there's only so
much that can go wrong with

676
01:02:18,479 --> 01:02:19,878
an internal combustion engine.

677
01:02:23,108 --> 01:02:25,361
Will you go in the back
and see if there's a

678
01:02:25,591 --> 01:02:27,215
a screwdriver or something?

679
01:02:31,685 --> 01:02:33,431
Careful, careful!

680
01:02:59,214 --> 01:03:00,538
Try it again.

681
01:03:06,265 --> 01:03:07,411
Try again.

682
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,596
Go ahead and try
one more time.

683
01:03:19,790 --> 01:03:20,631
Nice.

684
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:53,442
I've already told you.
There's no way we can do it.

685
01:03:53,452 --> 01:03:54,652
The launch is scrapped.

686
01:03:54,671 --> 01:03:55,768
But the shuttle is on the launch pad.

687
01:03:55,778 --> 01:03:59,278
It could be launched and we've got
no other choice except to try.

688
01:03:59,472 --> 01:04:01,237
That's just the problem,
it can't be launched.

689
01:04:02,006 --> 01:04:04,748
The electromagnetic storm have wrecked
irrevocable havoc on all our systems.

690
01:04:05,002 --> 01:04:08,063
- So it's the control panel?
- Gone. Nothing's working.

691
01:04:08,692 --> 01:04:10,448
You still got power, don't you?

692
01:04:10,568 --> 01:04:12,345
Well, the emergency generator system.

693
01:04:12,465 --> 01:04:14,233
Alright, then hook it
directly to the shuttle,

694
01:04:14,243 --> 01:04:16,143
create a makeshift control panel

695
01:04:16,362 --> 01:04:18,185
and get ready to do it manually.

696
01:04:20,112 --> 01:04:21,210
You gotta be kidding.

697
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:23,792
You know how many variables are
involved with the rocket firing sequence?

698
01:04:23,912 --> 01:04:25,802
Just keeping them stabilized
is difficult enough.

699
01:04:25,922 --> 01:04:29,191
You people have fired off enough shuttles
by now to be able to do it in your sleep.

700
01:04:29,936 --> 01:04:32,687
Take the training wheels
off and do it manually.

701
01:04:33,635 --> 01:04:34,978
Is it possible?

702
01:04:36,452 --> 01:04:38,828
The earthquake could have damaged
the launch structure too.

703
01:04:39,363 --> 01:04:40,199
I mean... I don't know.

704
01:04:40,969 --> 01:04:42,149
It scares the shit outta me too,

705
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:45,650
but either way,
if we don't go up there we're gonna die.

706
01:04:46,227 --> 01:04:48,123
Anyone else have a better idea?

707
01:05:09,485 --> 01:05:11,747
Still believe in the
hand of God, Dzerzhinsky?

708
01:05:15,075 --> 01:05:16,699
God’s great hand?

709
01:05:17,272 --> 01:05:20,605
sweeping across the
universe to destroy all of mankind?

710
01:05:22,382 --> 01:05:24,693
Why don't you just
let me enjoy cigarette

711
01:05:24,703 --> 01:05:27,302
before I go blow myself
up in that machine?

712
01:05:49,798 --> 01:05:51,413
<i>All lines are busy.</i>

713
01:06:01,779 --> 01:06:03,366
If they can't complete this soon,

714
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:05,507
then it doesn't matter anyway.

715
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:11,864
She is very correct.

716
01:06:12,888 --> 01:06:14,061
Just using,

717
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:17,920
acceleration factor of burst
so far is baseline.

718
01:06:18,702 --> 01:06:21,557
I would have to say
that we have only about

719
01:06:21,677 --> 01:06:24,533
eight hours 'till
supernova burst.

720
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:31,503
It's too bad our people's republic
space program wasn't further along.

721
01:06:31,945 --> 01:06:33,297
Because we would have
planned this much better,

722
01:06:33,307 --> 01:06:35,807
for us to not have
problems like this.

723
01:06:35,938 --> 01:06:38,191
You may have had
better planning but...

724
01:06:38,426 --> 01:06:42,585
you would still need Russian
engineering in order to do better.

725
01:06:45,118 --> 01:06:47,825
As long as we're talking about planning,
I'd like to reexamine

726
01:06:47,926 --> 01:06:49,625
where we're going to
explode the warheads.

727
01:06:49,992 --> 01:06:54,283
That has already been decided.
It's already been decided based on numbers.

728
01:06:56,288 --> 01:06:58,752
The electromagnetic and
molecular interaction

729
01:06:58,762 --> 01:07:01,461
but not in how the
magnetosphere works.

730
01:07:02,137 --> 01:07:04,663
We already know what you think about
how it will affect the earth.

731
01:07:04,888 --> 01:07:06,832
I'm not talking about climate effects.

732
01:07:07,052 --> 01:07:09,982
I'm talking about the best
way to use it as a shield.

733
01:07:10,508 --> 01:07:11,531
Look,

734
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:13,939
we have two shields,

735
01:07:14,059 --> 01:07:15,704
against the supernova burst,

736
01:07:15,824 --> 01:07:16,712
the magnetosphere,

737
01:07:17,019 --> 01:07:18,202
and the nuclear cloud shield.

738
01:07:18,322 --> 01:07:20,211
Based on molecular interaction

739
01:07:20,331 --> 01:07:23,310
with constant warheads explosions,
the nuclear cloud

740
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:25,817
will defiantly be the
stronger of the two.

741
01:07:25,937 --> 01:07:27,836
against the supernova's
gamma radiation

742
01:07:27,956 --> 01:07:29,169
And I agree.

743
01:07:29,414 --> 01:07:32,794
Based on the numbers it will hold
together a little more strongly

744
01:07:32,914 --> 01:07:35,629
if we position it inside
the magnetosphere.

745
01:07:36,056 --> 01:07:38,657
Okay, but how the
magnetosphere works

746
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:42,094
its self-sustaining.

747
01:07:42,779 --> 01:07:44,939
It can take smaller energy bursts

748
01:07:45,059 --> 01:07:46,347
and to recover quickly.

749
01:07:46,547 --> 01:07:49,213
Which means,
with the cloud shield outside of it,

750
01:07:49,561 --> 01:07:52,631
then the magnetosphere will act as
a constant second shield.

751
01:07:52,751 --> 01:07:54,725
to catch the radiation the
cloud shield misses.

752
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:58,258
But if the magnetosphere takes,

753
01:07:58,727 --> 01:08:02,624
the full burst of the supernova first,
disrupting its flow

754
01:08:03,265 --> 01:08:05,978
it won't be able to regenerate
and all that will be left

755
01:08:06,098 --> 01:08:07,875
is the one shield, the cloud shield

756
01:08:08,316 --> 01:08:11,371
- ... to protect the earth.
- This is what's important.

757
01:08:11,438 --> 01:08:14,037
The strength of the... cloud shield.

758
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:17,135
The numbers supports it.

759
01:08:17,652 --> 01:08:19,380
The scientific community agrees.

760
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,173
I don't think we should
change things now.

761
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,752
Even if we wanted to,
there's no time to program the

762
01:08:23,762 --> 01:08:25,661
new sequences into
the launch computer.

763
01:08:26,713 --> 01:08:28,459
- I still have...
- No!

764
01:08:28,885 --> 01:08:30,406
We are sticking with the plan.

765
01:08:35,298 --> 01:08:36,359
Are you ready?

766
01:08:39,218 --> 01:08:40,336
No.

767
01:08:41,303 --> 01:08:42,758
But that's not gonna stop us.

768
01:08:43,322 --> 01:08:44,157
Alright.

769
01:08:44,467 --> 01:08:47,059
If you really wanna do this,
Get your gear.

770
01:09:15,125 --> 01:09:16,083
All systems?

771
01:09:16,203 --> 01:09:17,689
<i>- It's powered up.
- Check.</i>

772
01:09:18,403 --> 01:09:19,482
<i>cabin pressure?</i>

773
01:09:20,947 --> 01:09:23,060
<i>10.2.0 PSI.</i>

774
01:09:23,407 --> 01:09:25,708
Exterior air temperature, 134 degrees.

775
01:09:26,607 --> 01:09:28,663
We're not supposed to launch
if it's over 99.

776
01:09:29,978 --> 01:09:31,785
Seeing how we don't even know if the
platform's up there,

777
01:09:31,795 --> 01:09:32,795
so that's the least of our worries.

778
01:09:33,818 --> 01:09:34,832
We're all set.

779
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:36,739
<i>Okay, commence countdown.</i>

780
01:09:45,683 --> 01:09:48,857
<i>I'm proud to stand along with you
on this new battlefield</i>

781
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:51,261
<i>an arena we have
never encountered.</i>

782
01:09:51,666 --> 01:09:53,488
<i>We sit on the brink
of annihilating</i>

783
01:09:53,929 --> 01:09:56,051
<i>and I speak to you now,
not just as your president.</i>

784
01:09:56,502 --> 01:09:59,610
<i>but as a fellow citizen of
United States and the entire world.</i>

785
01:10:00,457 --> 01:10:04,439
<i>By now you all know the ensuing
supernova and the consequences it may bring.</i>

786
01:10:05,490 --> 01:10:07,885
<i>It is an event this world
will not soon forget.</i>

787
01:10:08,664 --> 01:10:10,429
<i>Let our hearts and
our minds guide us,</i>

788
01:10:10,778 --> 01:10:13,876
<i>but not let them limit or consume
us with greed and selfpreservation.</i>

789
01:10:13,996 --> 01:10:17,380
<i>but let us instead become infected with
goodwill and love toward our fellowman.</i>

790
01:10:18,205 --> 01:10:21,454
<i>Let this be our finest hour.
if it is to be our last.</i>

791
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:23,989
<i>Remember hope.</i>

792
01:10:24,336 --> 01:10:26,778
<i>Remember your loved ones
and those who came before us.</i>

793
01:10:27,607 --> 01:10:29,785
<i>Remember the legacy and what
they have given us.</i>

794
01:10:30,442 --> 01:10:33,888
<i>And if it be God's will,
may He preserve us all.</i>

795
01:10:59,417 --> 01:11:01,483
<i>Rocket booster de-tatch.</i>

796
01:11:01,603 --> 01:11:03,689
Our trajectory is off by 2 degrees.

797
01:11:03,809 --> 01:11:07,755
Without NASA control guiding us,
I'm pretty amazed we're doing this good.

798
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:18,102
- We are at the edge of the shield.
- The ship can make it...

799
01:11:24,041 --> 01:11:25,599
It's coming apart.

800
01:11:30,519 --> 01:11:32,059
What... what are you doing?

801
01:11:32,179 --> 01:11:34,585
Increasing the thrust as it
get us through the ionosphere.

802
01:11:38,991 --> 01:11:41,311
Electric storm is not good.

803
01:11:42,109 --> 01:11:43,386
It's getting worse,
another charge,

804
01:11:47,990 --> 01:11:49,239
<i>I found the receiver.</i>

805
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,197
<i>The space platform.</i>

806
01:11:52,413 --> 01:11:53,483
<i>It's...</i>

807
01:12:09,697 --> 01:12:10,730
What is it?

808
01:12:14,364 --> 01:12:15,923
We ran out of gas.

809
01:12:20,451 --> 01:12:21,293
Alright.

810
01:12:21,822 --> 01:12:23,484
Let's see if we
can get some.

811
01:12:31,058 --> 01:12:33,443
Hey, we ran out of gas.
Can you help us out?

812
01:12:49,396 --> 01:12:51,415
There is no escaping this, is there?

813
01:12:51,744 --> 01:12:53,227
We're all gonna die.

814
01:12:53,499 --> 01:12:55,415
Stop it!
Stop it!

815
01:12:57,359 --> 01:12:58,504
Listen to me!

816
01:12:59,287 --> 01:13:00,367
We can make it.

817
01:13:01,259 --> 01:13:03,306
We can. We have a really good chance
of surviving.

818
01:13:03,587 --> 01:13:06,048
But if we gonna do that
we need to do it together, okay?

819
01:13:07,794 --> 01:13:10,716
I need you to be strong and I need
your help. You can do that?

820
01:13:11,665 --> 01:13:12,782
You can do that, right?

821
01:13:13,204 --> 01:13:14,078
- Yes.
- Okay.

822
01:13:34,289 --> 01:13:37,097
You have to make the adjustments
on the replacement panel!

823
01:13:38,273 --> 01:13:40,846
Time before energy
burst hitting us,

824
01:13:40,966 --> 01:13:44,780
tells me we only have 28 minutes before...

825
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:46,677
You know...

826
01:13:47,267 --> 01:13:48,488
How long?

827
01:13:48,826 --> 01:13:51,014
28 minutes.

828
01:13:52,131 --> 01:13:54,816
Let’s hope this place
has 28 minutes left.

829
01:14:02,847 --> 01:14:05,326
The panel is fried,
but there's still juice.

830
01:14:07,422 --> 01:14:09,366
We got 27 minutes.

831
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,479
Okay, I think I got it.

832
01:14:13,882 --> 01:14:17,366
Go ahead program the launch codes
while I get my laptop up and running.

833
01:14:28,287 --> 01:14:29,797
Section B is not just breeched,
it's gone.

834
01:14:29,898 --> 01:14:32,298
I got it closed down,
but no telling which one is next.

835
01:14:32,417 --> 01:14:34,100
Hurry!

836
01:14:35,809 --> 01:14:36,766
Okay!

837
01:14:38,364 --> 01:14:40,177
The sequence couplings are frozen.

838
01:14:40,402 --> 01:14:42,749
The missiles aren't gonna deploy
unless I do manually.

839
01:14:46,019 --> 01:14:49,146
I think I got it.
Initiate the firing sequence.

840
01:14:50,892 --> 01:14:51,963
Dzerzhinsky?

841
01:14:54,951 --> 01:14:56,153
Dzerzhinsky!

842
01:14:57,589 --> 01:14:58,707
Come on!

843
01:14:59,721 --> 01:15:00,894
Dzerzhinsky?

844
01:15:55,808 --> 01:15:57,752
You'll never change
launch sequence.

845
01:15:59,292 --> 01:16:00,860
All I need is your eyeball.

846
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:03,470
<i>Kelvin, Ryan,
project head.</i>

847
01:16:38,282 --> 01:16:41,484
Kelvin, Ryan
project head.

848
01:16:45,137 --> 01:16:46,818
Switch to launch scenario B.

849
01:16:46,938 --> 01:16:50,574
Set time and distance,
outside the magnetosphere.

850
01:17:05,327 --> 01:17:06,801
I'm burning up.

851
01:17:07,181 --> 01:17:08,618
I can't take this.

852
01:17:14,083 --> 01:17:14,919
Ryan!

853
01:17:34,147 --> 01:17:35,527
<i>Recalculating.</i>

854
01:17:38,613 --> 01:17:40,650
<i>Ordinance file malfunction.</i>

855
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:42,160
<i>Recalculating.</i>

856
01:17:42,331 --> 01:17:46,098
<i>8, 7, 6, 5,</i>

857
01:17:46,199 --> 01:17:49,298
<i>4, 3, 2, 1.</i>

858
01:18:12,990 --> 01:18:14,615
<i>Warning!</i>

859
01:18:15,648 --> 01:18:19,826
Computer, open the channel
to ground control.

860
01:18:22,086 --> 01:18:23,861
Kelvin to Henreaux.

861
01:18:25,391 --> 01:18:26,612
Henreaux can you read me?

862
01:18:26,847 --> 01:18:28,471
<i>It's Henreaux, go ahead.</i>

863
01:18:29,232 --> 01:18:30,086
Henreaux...

864
01:18:31,988 --> 01:18:33,631
My systems are haywire up here.

865
01:18:34,645 --> 01:18:37,509
- Do you have ordinance read-outs?
- Yes, it's affirmative.

866
01:18:39,189 --> 01:18:40,880
<i>How many did NOT deploy?</i>

867
01:18:43,428 --> 01:18:44,977
How many did not deploy?

868
01:18:45,287 --> 01:18:46,461
<i>Eight, Kelvin.</i>

869
01:18:48,912 --> 01:18:51,146
- Shit.
- Kelvin, listen to me!

870
01:18:51,681 --> 01:18:53,024
The shield still may hold.

871
01:18:53,144 --> 01:18:54,968
You need to confirm that
with Ye and Dzerzhinsky.

872
01:18:55,088 --> 01:18:56,724
That's not happening, Henreaux.

873
01:18:58,536 --> 01:19:00,874
We both know the
shield is weak as it is.

874
01:19:06,070 --> 01:19:07,413
<i>We know what
we have to do.</i>

875
01:19:11,392 --> 01:19:12,885
Tell my wife and daughter...

876
01:19:14,453 --> 01:19:15,655
I love them, alright?

877
01:19:17,045 --> 01:19:18,453
Kelvin, what are you doing?

878
01:19:19,007 --> 01:19:20,012
Computer...

879
01:19:21,980 --> 01:19:23,539
close comlink.

880
01:19:40,343 --> 01:19:41,845
<i>time to impact.</i>

881
01:19:41,965 --> 01:19:46,154
15, 14, 13,

882
01:19:46,255 --> 01:19:49,754
12, 11, 10

883
01:19:49,874 --> 01:19:53,576
9, 8, 7, 6...

884
01:19:53,696 --> 01:19:55,595
Computer, detach the central spindle...

885
01:19:57,106 --> 01:19:58,177
Come on!

886
01:19:58,297 --> 01:20:01,342
3, 2, 1.

887
01:21:20,373 --> 01:21:21,396
Mrs. Kelvin.

888
01:21:22,523 --> 01:21:23,978
I had to come myself.

889
01:21:24,993 --> 01:21:26,373
There is someone
you have to talk to.

890
01:21:34,439 --> 01:21:35,243
Hello!

891
01:21:39,687 --> 01:21:40,575
Ryan?

892
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:43,082
Ryan?

893
01:21:45,236 --> 01:21:46,438
Yeah, I can hear you.

894
01:21:54,034 --> 01:21:55,236
<i>Supernova,</i>

895
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:57,275
<i>an exploded star.</i>

896
01:21:58,505 --> 01:22:02,233
<i>The genesis of life itself on
a collision course with our planet.</i>

897
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:06,983
<i>Dzerzhinsky once told me it
was like God's great hands</i>

898
01:22:06,993 --> 01:22:08,593
sweeping across the universe.

899
01:22:08,712 --> 01:22:10,883
<i>intenting to destroying all mankind.</i>

900
01:22:11,815 --> 01:22:14,998
<i>a cosmic broom meant to clear
the way for something new.</i>

901
01:22:16,407 --> 01:22:17,890
<i>God's will or not,</i>

902
01:22:18,144 --> 01:22:20,266
<i>it came from deep in space.</i>

903
01:22:21,027 --> 01:22:23,778
<i>and felt terror
and isolation of being alone.</i>

904
01:22:25,562 --> 01:22:28,078
<i>What does man do when its
back is against the wall?</i>

905
01:22:28,783 --> 01:22:32,210
<i>Ye, tried to change the codes to
protect the eastern hemisphere more heavily,</i>

906
01:22:32,654 --> 01:22:34,823
<i>helping to ensure the
perseveration of her people.</i>

907
01:22:36,166 --> 01:22:38,607
<i>Thinking back, it's hard
to blame anyone for that.</i>

908
01:22:39,659 --> 01:22:41,687
<i>When I returned to a hero's welcome</i>

909
01:22:42,995 --> 01:22:47,878
<i>I said that Ye and Dzerzhinsky died
saving not only my life,</i>

910
01:22:48,591 --> 01:22:50,141
<i>but the lives of billions.</i>

911
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:52,479
<i>We weren’t prepared.</i>

912
01:22:53,379 --> 01:22:56,666
<i>We didn't see it coming,
but we found a way</i>

913
01:22:58,403 --> 01:23:01,567
<i>The nuclear shield held,
but not without its own consequences.</i>

914
01:23:03,027 --> 01:23:06,154
<i>The world has changed,
but we're still here.</i>

915
01:23:06,755 --> 01:23:08,135
<i>And stronger for it.</i>

916
01:23:08,886 --> 01:23:10,821
<i>When all the pretents melts away...</i>

917
01:23:11,234 --> 01:23:12,868
<i>you're finally able to hold on,</i>

918
01:23:13,517 --> 01:23:15,208
<i>to what's important.</i>

919
01:23:16,308 --> 01:23:21,008
