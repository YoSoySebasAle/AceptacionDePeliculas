1
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:51,207
You know, a lot has changed
in my life in the past year.

2
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,959
Suzanne and I got married...

3
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,003
...and her and the kids moved
into my apartment.

4
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,048
My very small apartment.

5
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,514
But that ain't all.

6
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:08,683
I decided to pursue my dream.

7
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,436
So I sold my sports shop
and started up a magazine.

8
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:15,606
You know what it is.
A sports magazine.

9
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,234
And these are the moments
that I cherish.

10
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:22,530
When everybody's asleep,
I got the whole place to myself...

11
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:25,449
...and now it's time to get to work.

12
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,181
So, Magic, how was it when you...?

13
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,684
How's your magazine coming?

14
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,936
Come here.

15
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,938
Kevin, what you doing up?
Trying to write.

16
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,524
I'm hungry.
Do you got Pop-Tarts?

17
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,609
You're always hungry.

18
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,904
And it's, "Do we got Pop-Tarts?"
We family now.

19
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,782
So, what's mine is yours,
and what's yours is mine.

20
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,036
-Understand?
-I understand I want Pop-Tarts.

21
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,125
Thanks, Nick.

22
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:20,880
Did you take my cell phone?

23
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,469
Mom, Kevin's stealing
my stuff again.

24
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:27,720
Nick, Coco's hungry.

25
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,723
Hey, you guys wanted the dog,
you gonna have to feed him.

26
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:31,932
Coco, breakfast!

27
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,812
-Good morning.
-Hey.

28
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,773
How's your writing
going this morning?

29
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,317
-Not too good.
-Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

30
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:44,820
Nick, there's something
we really need to talk about.

31
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,031
Hold that thought.
Hey! No! Wait a minute.

32
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,283
No! No! No!

33
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,743
Open this door.

34
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,453
I have to put on my makeup, Nick.

35
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:54,705
You're too young to wear makeup.

36
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,582
Now, I'm gonna count to three.

37
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,958
One.

38
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,418
Two.

39
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:07,093
I'm aImost 14, Nick.
You can't keep treating me like a child.

40
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,594
No, no. You're only 1 3.

41
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,222
And as your stepfather,
I have the God-given right...

42
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:12,848
...to treat you like a child.

43
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,768
Suzanne, do you see
what this girl got on?

44
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,311
I'm not in it.

45
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,190
Okay, okay, I am not dressing
like somebody's grandma.

46
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:24,902
After school, AshIey and I are going to
the malI for the Nordstrom sale.

47
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:28,489
No. No. Veto.
That ain't gonna happen.

48
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:29,824
I don't like that one bit.

49
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:32,034
You're too young
to be hanging out at the malI.

50
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:33,994
So go get dressed, granny.

51
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,038
Too young for the mall?

52
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,707
You're like a prison guard.

53
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:42,628
Yeah, well, welcome to Alcatraz.

54
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:51,137
So, Nick, you know,
the Lutskys are moving.

55
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,181
-So?
-Well, it's a three-bedroom.

56
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,976
Yeah, it's probabIy three times
as expensive too.

57
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,352
Hey!

58
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:05,401
Oh, you wanna be treated like a adult?
You can't even wrap a piece of pizza.

59
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:06,944
You said I was a child.

60
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:11,031
Nick, there's something that we really
need to taIk about this morning.

61
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:14,743
I can't taIk right now.
Look at me. I'm a mess.

62
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,163
Kevin.

63
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,499
Okay. Out. Both you guys. Out.

64
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,793
I got a presentation today
with my publisher.

65
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:26,964
-Let's go. I need to talk to your mother.
-You too, Coco. Get out. Go.

66
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,382
This place.

67
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,343
Coco, get down before
you knock something over.

68
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,352
And what were you trying to say?

69
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,274
Honey, I'm pregnant.

70
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,818
By who?

71
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:54,533
So you sold your half
of the shop to Marty?

72
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,452
He's gotta be happy
about that, huh?

73
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,621
Yeah, he is. But I am too, you know?

74
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,874
I'm starting a new chapter
in my Iife, my man.

75
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,417
I'm launching a magazine.

76
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:06,212
That's great. You took a risk,
and you made it happen.

77
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,963
You got Magic. I'm proud of you.

78
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,132
Whoa, hey!

79
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,093
Who said anything about Magic?

80
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,553
You don't have him?

81
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,055
Officially, no.

82
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,641
But it's looking good.
It's looking real good.

83
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,601
Matter of fact, it's Iooking so good...

84
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:25,814
...pour me a shot, pour yourseIf a shot
and then pour one for my man Magic.

85
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,358
Let me ask you something, Nick.

86
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,610
If you don't have him,
why'd you sell the shop?

87
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,320
I need the money, Jimmy.

88
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:34,823
It's been cooI, but it's kind of hard
having Suzanne and the kids...

89
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,243
...just crammed up
into my smalI pIace.

90
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,495
It's just time to move on up, man.

91
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,081
PIus, I didn't tell you,
I'm having a baby.

92
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,124
AIl right. My man's having a baby.

93
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,835
-Yeah. Yeah. That's right.
-Hey, baby.

94
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,463
-Hey, hey, hey.
-I thought l'd find you here. Hi, Jimmy.

95
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,800
-How'd it go?
-It went great.

96
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,593
Check it out.

97
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:57,846
Hey.

98
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:02,017
This baby got two heads.

99
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:06,438
And four arms and four legs.
Nick, we're having twins.

100
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,651
Twins?

101
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,323
-Honey.
-Cut off, Nick.

102
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,325
Thanks, Jimmy.

103
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,960
I can't believe you're making us
move to the country.

104
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:30,713
This is like child abuse
of the worst kind.

105
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:34,049
Where's the mall?

106
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,427
What you need a malI for?
That's your probIem now.

107
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,430
You need to get a littIe fresh air
and open spaces. Try that.

108
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,225
Lindsey, please. Okay?
Everybody, just relax.

109
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,394
Yeah, just relax.

110
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,563
Here, sweetie. Have a juice.

111
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,651
-Oh, God--
-Kevin!

112
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,905
What's that smell?

113
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,908
Smells like oxygen.

114
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,369
Mom, please teIl me you're joking.

115
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,705
-Enough.
-I hope it's the right place.

116
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:08,250
Of course it's not.
Our oId house is the right house.

117
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,461
This is the pIace, guys. Come on.

118
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,089
Let's have a positive
mental attitude, okay?

119
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,099
Nice floors.

120
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,934
I smelI cookies.

121
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:31,023
Kevin, Kevin, you cannot just walk
around these peopIe's house like that.

122
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,112
Oh, this the cuIprit right here.

123
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:39,656
God!

124
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:44,870
Oh, baby. Oh, honey.
Okay, cold water. Go. Cold water.

125
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,958
Oh, goodness gracious!
What happened in here?

126
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,711
Did you touch the stove?
Was it the stove?

127
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,464
I'll tell you what, gonna put
Tunisian hemp root on there.

128
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:56,715
Make it as good as new.

129
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,469
It's true, actually.
I'm so sorry about that.

130
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,972
It's fine. He's just being a big baby.

131
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,308
Name's Chuck MitchelI Jr.

132
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:10,187
I'm the local real-estate guy
here in Newburg County and....

133
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,398
You....

134
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,150
I know just exactIy who you are.

135
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,819
You're Nick.

136
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,780
There we go.

137
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,324
Note to self, the hand stilI hurts.

138
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:27,162
-And the radiant....
-Suzanne.

139
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,915
Oh, my G-O-D.

140
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,835
Suzanne's with child.

141
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,882
You old dog, you!

142
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,510
-Oh, well--
-HoId up.

143
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,304
It's okay. I'm a part-time midwife.

144
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,806
I actualIy studied...

145
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:49,017
...at the Natural Childbirth Centre
in Lucerne, SwitzerIand.

146
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:53,188
They're twins, aren't they?

147
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:57,192
Yes, they are.
How did you know that?

148
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,738
Would you Iike to know the sexes?

149
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:04,950
No.

150
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,662
Matter of fact, we wanna
keep it a surprise, Chuck.

151
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,415
Oh, fair enough. lsn't that
every parent's prerogative?

152
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:18,213
But if I were you, l wouIdn't be in any
big hurry to paint the nursery pink.

153
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:22,885
Oh, gosh. It's just a special time,
being in that delivery room.

154
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,054
Right. The man almost fainted
when our guppy had babies.

155
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:29,349
Now, you know that
that was a hard delivery for me.

156
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:33,979
AIl that cIoudy water and then those
little things popping out one by one.

157
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,566
Honey?

158
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,234
Babe.

159
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,111
Honey.

160
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:48,452
Now, the place was built in 1 889
by H. Van Hackett himseIf...

161
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,662
...legendary architect
and perfectionist.

162
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,831
I'd like to telI you something
right up front:

163
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:57,544
In all my years in "the business"--
And there have been more than a few.

164
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:01,089
--I have never seen
a more sound home.

165
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,175
Structurally speaking.

166
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,261
Wait till you get a load
of the second floor.

167
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,804
Baby, do you see this?

168
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,932
-It's okay, we'll fix it.
-Did you see this?

169
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:14,436
Now, she's got five bedrooms
and four bathrooms...

170
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:18,440
...so needless to say, there's plenty
of room for the whoIe fam.

171
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:23,820
I think we're gonna go ahead and put
Mom and Dad in the master bedroom.

172
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,281
-Five bedrooms, right?
-Five, baby. You feeling me?

173
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,449
I'm feeling you.

174
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,410
-This big enough for you, baby?
-It's beautiful.

175
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,872
And, of course, the master bathroom.

176
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,626
Oh, my God, baby, a claw-foot tub.

177
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:40,462
-I've always wanted one of these.
-Me too.

178
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,089
Pretty awesome, right?

179
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:46,843
-I like it.
-It's beautiful. And the double sinks!

180
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,557
Oh, my God.
Baby, look at the shower.

181
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:55,727
Oh, my God, honey, this is bigger
than our entire apartment.

182
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,771
I know.

183
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,148
What's in there, Chuck?

184
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:03,652
That is a private toilet.

185
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,908
Baby.

186
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,494
-Did you say private?
-Yes, sir.

187
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,122
Oh, my God.

188
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,416
How I Iook?

189
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,084
How do you feel?

190
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,335
I feel good.

191
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,504
Feeling good's good enough.

192
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,303
You be okay in there, Nick?

193
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,556
Just give me one minute.

194
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:42,983
So, now, Suzanne here telIs me
that you're in the publishing game?

195
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:46,153
Oh, yeah, I did seIl a magazine
to OmniHouse.

196
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:47,321
An entrepreneur.

197
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,699
A budding William Randolph Hearst
right here in our midst.

198
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:54,119
I don't really know who that is,
Chuck, but, hey, I guess so.

199
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,204
Modest too? They broke the mouId.

200
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,707
I'll tell you what, Suze,
I'd hang on to this one.

201
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,543
Oh, yeah, he's a keeper, Chuck.

202
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,547
Oh, way to stick the landing, Kev-o.

203
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:15,724
The Hacketts, of course,
used this as a guest cottage.

204
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:19,102
But with just a "scootcharino" of work,
it could be easily converted...

205
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:22,314
...into the perfect creative nook for,
you know, a....

206
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,317
A publisher.

207
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:29,071
You know, I was thinking about
writing in that bathroom up there.

208
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,739
Oh, yeah?

209
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,534
-Oh, honey, this is so charming.
-This'll work too.

210
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,871
Just for a second, Nick,
just for a second, imagine....

211
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,374
Imagine watching
a blue-throated hummingbird...

212
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,710
...suckle the nectar from a fresh
hydrangea blossom...

213
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:46,338
...whiIe you free your mind...

214
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:50,133
...to the creative impulses that have
made every publishing empire great.

215
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,595
This is not a dress rehearsal, Nick.

216
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:58,058
Live the dream, baby,
live the dream.

217
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:02,437
Would you guys like
to see a tremendous view?

218
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,439
Would you? Come on. Come on.

219
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:07,901
-It's the coup de grâce. You'll love it.
-Come on, baby.

220
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:11,196
You're gonna wanna get low
coming through this door.

221
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,366
The roof-- Think you'll find the roof
needs a little bit of work...

222
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:17,244
...so please be careful.

223
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,418
The property includes
an apple orchard.

224
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:28,422
There's some wiId blackberries
over here, some cedars.

225
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:32,259
And I don't even wanna tell you
about the view of the Iake from here.

226
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:33,427
Breathe.

227
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:38,807
Breathe, breathe in that rich,
fresh air, Mr. Publisher.

228
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:40,809
How about it?

229
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:45,105
Oh, not so incidentally, they just built
a brand-new school down the road.

230
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:46,314
RealIy?

231
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,651
Newburg is a really amazing place
to raise a family.

232
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,945
Oh, it's just so beautiful, Chuck.

233
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:55,323
Well, you should see it
in the middle of the winter...

234
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,493
...with a bIanket of snow covering it.
It's pretty as a postcard.

235
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,663
Personally, I like to power-walk
through these woods.

236
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:06,501
Never mind the fact that, of course,
I used to do the waIk competitively.

237
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:07,836
RealIy?

238
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:12,466
Yeah, l was an alternate
to the '94 Goodwill Games in Russia.

239
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:19,681
Like l say, she is a fixer-upper...

240
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:23,018
...but l happen to know the finest
contractor in these parts.

241
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:25,687
You give that gentleman
a caIl and....

242
00:18:25,855 --> 00:18:28,064
One way to make your life
a whoIe Iot easier.

243
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,275
So, now, where do
we stand there, Nickster?

244
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:32,903
I don't know, Chuck.

245
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,698
I'm not really sure if this is
the right pIace for us, you know.

246
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,534
It's a little high-priced
and you're a little weird.

247
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,956
Oh, gosh, I actualIy scheduled
a couple back-to-back with you guys.

248
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:49,711
Larry, Bernice. Hello! Come in.
PIease, make yourself at home.

249
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,297
-Okay, Chuck. Thanks.
-Thank you.

250
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,673
I gotta go.

251
00:18:58,638 --> 00:18:59,638
So, what you think?

252
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:03,308
I don't know. l don't know.
Can we really afford this house?

253
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:04,518
Of course.

254
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,562
Baby, with the advance,
plus the money we saved on rent...

255
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,148
...we can buy this place
two times over.

256
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:12,150
And have money to fix it up.

257
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,819
And guess what.

258
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,403
I can do the fixing.

259
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:18,657
I can barely get you to change
a light bulb at the apartment.

260
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:21,743
So what? Look, look.
Take a look at this.

261
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,495
-A house is like a painting.
-Yeah.

262
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:27,123
You can't really buy with your head,
you gotta buy with your heart.

263
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,335
Yeah, honey, but we have to think
with our heads right now.

264
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:31,878
We gotta think about the kids.

265
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:34,923
We gotta think about
it's the middle of the school year...

266
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:40,428
...Lindsey has her friends and she just
met that nice boy in her math cIass.

267
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:43,223
There's pIenty of stuff
around here for Lindsey to do...

268
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:45,100
...that have nothing to do with boys.

269
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:46,726
And Kevin, this is perfect!

270
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,104
Look at the nature.
Look at the wiIderness.

271
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:51,189
We got a blueberry tree, baby.

272
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:54,860
Are we talking about the same kid?
Kevin doesn't go outside for recess.

273
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:58,780
That's why he needs a place like this,
to toughen him up.

274
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,824
PIus, I can take him fishing.

275
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,409
Who's going fishing?

276
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:04,494
-Me.
-You fish?

277
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:05,954
Oh, I can fish, baby.

278
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,123
Oh, when's the last time
you went fishing?

279
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,793
Last time-- Matter of fact,
it was before I met you...

280
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,253
...last time I went fishing.

281
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:14,588
And....

282
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:17,090
I don't know how to fish,
but I can learn.

283
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,718
And then I could teach him,
and we can bond.

284
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:21,845
-"We can bond."
-We'Il become a true family.

285
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:24,472
-"A true famiIy."
-Picture it.

286
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,641
What you think?

287
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:32,606
I think there are a lot
of rooms in this house...

288
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,984
...that are gonna need breaking in.

289
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:39,321
Oh, yeah?
Well, what about the roof?

290
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,324
The roof isn't a bad place to start.

291
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,327
Well, come over here,
drop it Iike it's hot, girI.

292
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,329
Baby!

293
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:53,919
We'll take it.

294
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:14,856
Good boy.

295
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:20,695
-Where'd she go?
-She was just.... I don't know.

296
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,573
There.

297
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,410
What you doing?

298
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,157
Stop! Coco, stop!

299
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,369
Help!

300
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,969
Hey, honey, do you know
how this garbage disposal works?

301
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:11,806
Because I've tried every single one
of these switches.

302
00:23:11,974 --> 00:23:13,224
What about this one?

303
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:18,980
See? Everything is working out
just like l promised, huh?

304
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,277
I can fix that.

305
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,654
Oh, you can fix that?

306
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:31,993
Hey, I hope we're not disturbing you.
I'm Mr. Rooney, this is Mrs. Rooney.

307
00:23:32,161 --> 00:23:35,371
Oh, so formal.
PIease, caIl me Mrs. Rooney.

308
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,749
We wanted to be the first
to welcome you.

309
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,584
Oh, we sure did.

310
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,586
We are the first, aren't we?

311
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:43,046
You're the first.

312
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:44,506
Yes.

313
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,966
-That looks gross.
-Kevin.

314
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,427
That fish put this town on the map.

315
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:53,389
Oh, yeah. Sturgeon tastes
a lot like chicken, only fishy.

316
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,350
-Nice.
-I think you're gonna enjoy it.

317
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:57,435
And even if you don't, it's dead.

318
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,271
Did you wanna come inside
for something to drink?

319
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,524
Oh, that's so sweet.

320
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,860
But we don't reaIly drink so early
in the day around these parts, but--

321
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:11,533
-Right. No.
-No, no, I meant, like, just a lemonade.

322
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:20,959
Boy, get them fish.

323
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:24,045
Thank you. Close the door.

324
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:26,714
-Welcome.
-For you.

325
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,008
Tastes Iike chicken.

326
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:35,765
Sturgeon, right?
Give me the fish, man.

327
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:38,560
Y'all get out of here
before I call the cops.

328
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:45,024
Hey, Nick.
I can't find Coco anywhere.

329
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,442
Give me that.

330
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:49,070
Don't worry about Coco,
he'll show up sooner or later.

331
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,823
There's a Iot of trees
to pee on out there.

332
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:56,703
What you want me to do?

333
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:00,748
Coco!

334
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:03,960
Where's that dog?

335
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:07,755
Maybe we should go back.
It's kind of scary out here.

336
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,966
Scary? Boy, it's beautifuI out here.

337
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:13,511
Look, you with the man. l was the man
in the city, and I'm the man out here.

338
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,723
Trust me, when you're with me,
there's nothing to be scared of.

339
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:20,685
But that.

340
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:26,107
Run! Go! Go!

341
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,526
Can you hear me now?

342
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:31,362
Hello? Can you hear me now?

343
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,490
Off the phone, please. Here we are.

344
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,076
Oh, Iook at this.

345
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,787
-That's nice.
-Yeah.

346
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,457
And Iook at us.
One big, happy famiIy.

347
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:45,084
Yes, one big, happy family.

348
00:25:45,628 --> 00:25:47,795
Lindsey, would you like
to give thanks?

349
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:49,797
Why, are we going home?

350
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,716
This is our home.

351
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:52,926
Our real home, Mom.

352
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:56,304
Where my friends are.
Where l can get cell phone reception.

353
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,806
Lindsey,
put away the phone, pIease.

354
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,808
Kevin?

355
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,353
-I don't Iike this fish.
-Me neither.

356
00:26:03,646 --> 00:26:06,856
But we're gonna be eating this
every day for the next six months...

357
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,483
...so get used to it.

358
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,903
Now, Lindsey. Grace.

359
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:15,823
Dear Lord, thank you for all the
blessings that you gave us.

360
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:18,159
Before they were taken away.

361
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,829
Like my friends,
celI phone reception--

362
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,248
Time-out, I got this.

363
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:24,916
PIease, honey.

364
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:28,002
Oh, patient and heavenly Father...

365
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:31,839
...who's probably 1 0 times
more patient and heavenly...

366
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,217
...than any stepfather
should have to be--

367
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,426
Baby.

368
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,886
--we give thanks.

369
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:39,055
I know at times it seems Iike...

370
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:41,975
...we're nothing but a bunch of
back-taIking sass mouths...

371
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:45,853
...who don't know when we got it good
in a nice, beautiful home.

372
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,277
At least the table's strong.

373
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,616
I can fix that.

374
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,786
Honey, I think you should
just call the contractor.

375
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:06,040
Suzanne, the electrical parts
alone is a 30 percent markup.

376
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:08,167
And a contractor?

377
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,795
You're taIking about
1 25 bucks a hour.

378
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:22,307
Now do you want the number?

379
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:30,898
Contractor's here!

380
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,906
Coco! Oh, Coco.

381
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:40,825
Coco, sit.

382
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:53,004
How did you do that?

383
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:55,590
That's German.
It's the language of discipIine.

384
00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:58,426
I was fortunate a coupIe of years back
to spend some time...

385
00:27:58,594 --> 00:28:01,095
...and study with the friars
of New Skete.

386
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:02,930
Nick!

387
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,391
I found Coco by the highway,
but it's no probIem...

388
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:09,062
-...because he had his tags on.
-Chuck, what you doing here?

389
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:12,899
I got a message down at the office
that you were looking for a contractor?

390
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:15,860
But you're the locaI real-estate guy.

391
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,945
Yes, l am.

392
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:20,490
And I'm also the local contractor.

393
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:21,949
Do you Iove it?

394
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:30,208
-What's that smelI?
-Fifty pounds of fish.

395
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:32,335
Do you know the power
went out last night?

396
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:33,878
On it.

397
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:37,840
What you mean, "ruh-roh"?

398
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:42,011
Nick, when exactly
did you buy this home?

399
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:43,638
Are you serious?

400
00:28:43,806 --> 00:28:45,681
You know exactly
when I bought this dump...

401
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,558
...because you the one sold it to us.

402
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,061
And that's what makes it
so very unpleasant for me...

403
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:53,272
...to have to tell you that your home's
electricaI system is shot.

404
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,401
AIl right, aIl right, all right.
Flag on the pIay.

405
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,320
Why didn't you tell us this
when you showed us the house?

406
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:03,699
Nick, in alI fairness,
I did have my ReaItor's cap on.

407
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:07,120
You know, might remember
that great bIue blazer and the khakis.

408
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,664
My contractor's hat was safely
at home in the closet.

409
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:11,958
They're two distinctly
different chapeaus...

410
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,336
...but they should have toId you
when you had the place inspected.

411
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,046
How's it going, guys?

412
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,173
Nick didn't have
this dump inspected.

413
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:22,343
I had it inspected. It was inspected.

414
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,183
It was just inspected by me.

415
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:31,436
Honey, how couId you not
hire an inspector?

416
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:34,147
We talked about this.
How could you be so irresponsible?

417
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,940
I trusted you on this.

418
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:39,360
-Don't blame me, it's his fault.
-Well, how is it Chuck's fault?

419
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:40,528
He lied!

420
00:29:40,696 --> 00:29:43,781
No, he didn't. You was just too cheap
to hire an inspector.

421
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,283
That's besides the point.

422
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,661
They're kicking, aren't they?

423
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:50,580
Feels like they're playing soccer.

424
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,248
You okay?

425
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:58,546
They say that the move
was very traumatic for them...

426
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:01,382
...and that you shouldn't sleep
on your right side.

427
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,967
How do you know, Chuck?

428
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:05,052
I'm a baby whisperer.

429
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,554
A baby what?

430
00:30:08,432 --> 00:30:12,852
AIso, they'd love it if you could lay off
the Indian food. Curry is a no-no.

431
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,729
Oh, brother.

432
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:18,149
Unfortunately, you gotta upgrade
the main paneI and pull all the wires.

433
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:19,859
That just sound like a bigger job.

434
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:21,736
Oh, crap.

435
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,700
You got racoons.

436
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,829
Oh, yeah. Racoons
that like Corn Nuts.

437
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:36,584
Word to the wise, carefuI with those
racoons. They're vicious.

438
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,002
Hey, hey, Chuck.

439
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,505
When it comes
to this electrical stuff....

440
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,716
How much this gonna cost me?

441
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,760
Oh, gosh, I don't know.
A home this size...

442
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:47,887
...you're looking at 8, 9.

443
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:49,889
-Hundred?
-Thousand.

444
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:51,891
Get off my property.

445
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,229
I might fixed.

446
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,272
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

447
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,776
Perfect.
That's what I'm talking about.

448
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:03,236
I'm professionaI.

449
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,488
Thanks. Appreciate it, Serge.

450
00:31:05,656 --> 00:31:07,406
Come again.

451
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:15,414
Did you see that? Look and Iearn,
little girl. 1 50 bucks. Painless.

452
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,291
Are you sure it's safe?

453
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,293
Of course it's safe.

454
00:31:19,461 --> 00:31:20,711
He said all we gotta do...

455
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:24,257
...is not use the microwave
and the toaster at the same time.

456
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:28,052
That's just common sense.

457
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:33,432
Eight thousand dollars.

458
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,143
I knew that dude Chuck
was a crook the minute l met him.

459
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,729
Oh, honey, l think
you're a Iittle bit stressed out...

460
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:42,149
...with the move and everything and,
you know...

461
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:45,194
...there's one thing
that we haven't been able to do...

462
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:46,988
...in this big old draughty mansion.

463
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:49,657
InsuIation. That'll be perfect.

464
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:53,035
If we do that, we'll save
a lot of money on heating bills.

465
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:56,539
Baby, I was actuaIly thinking of
something eIse we could do...

466
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:59,041
...to stay nice and warm.

467
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,544
Oh, I know what you're thinking.

468
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,506
Honey, what was that?

469
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:07,133
The racoon.

470
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:08,968
-He's on the roof?
-Yeah.

471
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:10,845
You gotta show him who's boss.

472
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:13,806
If you don't do that,
you'll never get rid of him.

473
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:16,851
Baby, but Chuck says they're vicious.

474
00:32:17,019 --> 00:32:18,603
Yeah, if you're a baby whisperer.

475
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:22,815
But me, I'm the man.

476
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,443
You are the man.

477
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,862
-You got my back?
-I got your back.

478
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,488
Watch this.

479
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,171
Is that my Corn Nuts?

480
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,591
You shouId know
not to mess with a man's nuts.

481
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:50,885
Be prepared
to pay the uItimate price.

482
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:53,387
Honey. Honey, what are you
doing out there?

483
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:54,805
Step back, baby.

484
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:56,766
What you wanna do?

485
00:32:57,768 --> 00:32:59,185
Look, he ain't even running.

486
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:01,729
He think he bad. You think you bad?

487
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:06,359
I've dealt with rats in the city
bigger than you, boy.

488
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,905
Kids, go to bed. I got this.

489
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:15,076
-Baby!
-I got him!

490
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,084
Did I get him?

491
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:26,754
-No.
-No.

492
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:30,841
Sucker.

493
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,909
Nicholas J. Persons?

494
00:33:57,327 --> 00:34:01,080
-Chuck?
-Charles MitcheIl. City inspector.

495
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:04,625
We got a problem. Let's go.

496
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,253
What's with the badge, Chuck?

497
00:34:07,421 --> 00:34:11,048
Look, l don't have time for
none of this, okay? So make it quick.

498
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:15,302
Sir, you can't just go around tapping
into other people's power supplies.

499
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,471
It's dangerous, it's against the law...

500
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,474
...and quite frankly, Mr. Persons,
it's rude.

501
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:22,601
What are you talking about?

502
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,145
I'm gonna go ahead and guess...

503
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,273
...that that work wasn't done
by a Iicensed contractor.

504
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:30,234
You know, I didn't even know
they was gonna Ieave it like that.

505
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:33,654
You went ahead and avaiIed yourseIf
to the cheap, unskilled labour pool...

506
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:35,948
...that congregates outside
the hardware store?

507
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:40,244
I know. Tell you what l'm gonna do.

508
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,663
For reference, I'm gonna
provide you with a list...

509
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:44,999
...of alI the licensed,
bonded contractors...

510
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:47,835
...we have here in the local vicinity.

511
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:54,175
I am also going to fine you $1 000
for breaking the law.

512
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,469
What? A thousand bucks?

513
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,179
If you knew what you were doing...

514
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:01,515
...you'd be facing jaiI time,
so consider yourself lucky.

515
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,811
We're shutting your power down
till further notice.

516
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:09,482
What am I supposed to do?
BuiId a windmilI?

517
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:13,319
Well, that's not a bad idea, so long as
you contact the city zoning officer first.

518
00:35:13,487 --> 00:35:15,488
Quality guy.
Would you Iike his card?

519
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:16,822
-No.
-I'm out of here.

520
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:20,451
Hey, wait a minute, Chuck.
Chuck, come on, man. lt's me. Nick.

521
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:23,829
Help me get my power back on.

522
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:25,956
I'm the city inspector, Mr. Persons.

523
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,209
Restoring power's
a littIe beyond my purview.

524
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:33,881
Okay, l know what this is. And l seen
this one before. What's it gonna take?

525
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:37,802
You realise if l accepted that,
I'd have to arrest myseIf on the spot...

526
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,345
...and I'm not that guy.

527
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,388
But you're a contractor.

528
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,225
But l'm not wearing
that hat right now.

529
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,479
Well, you can put it on.

530
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:54,485
It's your lucky day.
It happens to be in the car.

531
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:02,493
Oh, God. Oh, what,
they shut you down?

532
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:06,247
The heartless bureaucrats.
They're the worst.

533
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:08,749
Can you help me?

534
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:11,836
Well, restoring power's
not as easy as it sounds.

535
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,754
It just might take a coupIe days.

536
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:17,383
A couple of days?
Man, I'm trying to Iaunch a magazine.

537
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:20,177
AIl right? What am I supposed to do
without a computer?

538
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:22,179
We're gonna get your power
back on.

539
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:24,473
It's not even gonna be an issue.

540
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:26,183
Trust me.

541
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:34,400
Here you go, honey.

542
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,069
Your sandwich.

543
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,614
-What?
-Okay.

544
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,076
-Hey, Suzanne.
-Hey, Chuck. Come on in.

545
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:45,953
What smelIs good?
Are those sandwiches?

546
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:48,247
Oh, yeah, sturgeon salad.
Would you Iike one?

547
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:51,458
-I hate to impose.
-Oh, no, Chuck, anything for you.

548
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:54,587
Hey, hey, hey, man. What's with
all the racket? l'm trying to work.

549
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:57,798
We had to saw off the breaker box.
I'd like some mustard on there.

550
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:59,133
I'm a big mustard guy.

551
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:02,636
But you should be good now.
We'll have you up and running in a jiff.

552
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:08,434
That's Magic Johnson. That's my guy.
That's my main man.

553
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:10,895
Did I telI you
I was on the '86 Lakers?

554
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,314
-No.
-Yes, indeedy, sweetie.

555
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,275
I had 38 seconds of playing time.

556
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,777
It was game two of the final
and "Big Game" James...

557
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:22,823
...went down with a bad wheeI,
so we're up by 20 and they put me in.

558
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,450
Check it out, Nicker.

559
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:26,702
Get ahold of the purple and gold.

560
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,248
That's commitment, right?

561
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:34,835
When you do talk to the Magic Man,
tell him Chuck-dog said:

562
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:37,087
"Holler. That's what's up."

563
00:37:38,006 --> 00:37:39,924
-"HolIer."
-Thank you so much.

564
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:43,928
Anyway, the good news is we're
getting the power up and running.

565
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:50,184
The bad news is you got dry rot.

566
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:52,144
Dry what?

567
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:55,147
Can l tell you something?
This is the most incredibIe sandwich.

568
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:57,358
You know your way
around a sturgeon.

569
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,277
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
Back to the dry rot.

570
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,445
How big is this?

571
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:05,157
Well, it could be considerable,
but y'all don't worry about a thing.

572
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:07,701
I know the best dry-rot guys
in Newburg County.

573
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,121
How's the guy situation out there?

574
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,874
Nothing at aIl.
No cuties, no nothing.

575
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:17,044
Girl, l feel sorry for you.

576
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:24,468
-I didn't wanna move here.
-I don't blame you.

577
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,472
Push. Push.

578
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,691
You should try
and get back here somehow.

579
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,693
At least there are boys here.

580
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,696
Are you still there? Linds? Hello?

581
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,573
Hello? Are you there?

582
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,118
Yeah. l gotta go.

583
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:56,917
Yup. You got the rot, brah.

584
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:02,673
-How you know?
-Nick.

585
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,049
-What?
-He's not aware.

586
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:09,096
Nick, the Pulu famiIy has been in the
dry-rot business for three generations.

587
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:11,807
Hawaiians know the dry rot
better than the rest of us...

588
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:13,851
...because the island is so darn wet.

589
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,520
Well, then why do they call it dry rot?

590
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,106
That's a misnomer. Listen carefully.

591
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:22,860
BilIy and George here,
they're highly skilled craftsmen...

592
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:27,614
...very much in demand,
but Danny, gosh, he's got a gift.

593
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:33,579
He's an artist, and if he says you've
got the rot, you've got the rot, brah.

594
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:39,960
Okay, say l got "the rot," brah.
I mean, can't we live with it?

595
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:43,297
Can you live with a wood-rotting
fungi that colonizes and spreads...

596
00:39:43,465 --> 00:39:46,091
...to every timber in your home,
leading to a mouId...

597
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:48,385
...which can produce
airborne pathogens...

598
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,804
...that might infect every member
of your family...

599
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:53,807
...causing conjunctivitis,
hypersensitivity pneumonitis...

600
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:55,809
...and I'm not gonna lie to you here...

601
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:58,854
...aIlergic bronchopulmonary
aspergiIlosis.

602
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,898
Oh, yeah. No problem.

603
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:02,816
No.

604
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:04,985
I think they should fix it now.

605
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,490
You know, that is, because we don't
want it to spread and kiIl us all, right?

606
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,825
Don't you got clothes
to go put on or something?

607
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:13,577
-Ma.
-Go.

608
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:19,333
Right here, right here.

609
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,710
AIl right, how much
is it gonna cost me?

610
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,088
-Tough to predict.
-It's like that.

611
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,592
Do what you gotta do, all right?
Do what you gotta do.

612
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,177
But you gotta put on these...

613
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:33,806
...because you're kind of fat and
I don't want you scuffing up my floors.

614
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,349
Don't be a hick, Nick.

615
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,851
These guys are professionaIs.

616
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:40,687
Nice bootie.

617
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:44,441
-Talking about this.
-Give it up.

618
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:49,446
Yes, ma'am. I understand you guys
need all the questions.

619
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,657
I have them right here
in front of me...

620
00:40:51,825 --> 00:40:55,202
...but l'm in the process of
relocating offices....

621
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,329
Maybe I can fax them
to you later on today?

622
00:40:57,497 --> 00:40:59,706
Or tomorrow, the next day,
or the day after that.

623
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:03,544
-As long as we make our deadline.
-Okay, thanks. TeIl Magic I said hey.

624
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:04,711
-Will do.
-All right.

625
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,630
-Goodbye.
-Bye-bye.

626
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,510
Peek-a-brah.

627
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,137
What up, man?

628
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,722
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. P.
We just need you to look...

629
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,058
...sign off on phase one
of the dry-rot repair.

630
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:20,310
Oh, okay. No problem.

631
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,229
Nice. Georgie, go long!

632
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:26,275
No, no, no. Georgie,
you don't have to go long.

633
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,902
I'll just meet y'aIl out front.

634
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,196
So how many phases is it?

635
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:33,031
Just two.

636
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:35,742
So you guys are halfway through.

637
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,537
Oh, man, that's painless.

638
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:57,598
What is this?

639
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,433
Phase one.

640
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:00,809
Phase one?

641
00:42:00,977 --> 00:42:02,102
Hey, Nickeroo.

642
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,897
You.

643
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,106
Where you been, man?

644
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:08,609
Suzanne was feeling tired,
so l picked up Kev-o...

645
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:09,818
...and shot some hoop.

646
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:11,403
What is wrong with you?

647
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:14,448
Man, you know this boy got asthma.
He can't shoot no hoops.

648
00:42:14,616 --> 00:42:18,785
He cured it, just like that.
With something caIled the go...?

649
00:42:19,287 --> 00:42:20,454
Goji berries.

650
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:22,831
-Listen.
-Check it out.

651
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:26,418
Inhale love.

652
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:29,796
Exhale inclusion.

653
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:33,759
It's a little trick l picked up during a
fast with His Holiness in Dharamsala.

654
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:35,469
And finish.

655
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:38,472
Yeah, well, His Holiness
doesn't have to deaI with his mother.

656
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:40,390
You keep your inhaler.

657
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,808
It was no bother.

658
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,852
We had to stop
at Fred's hardware store...

659
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,897
...to pick up a new tankless
water heater. Your old one's shot.

660
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:51,151
Oh, so now you going out and buying
things without even asking me first.

661
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:55,989
I don't know what to teIl you.
It's a tankless job.

662
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:59,451
-I did not--
-Yes, he did.

663
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:03,956
-Good one, Chuck.
-Good one, Chuck.

664
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:10,003
Oh, what a great kid. HoIy moly,
does he have a terrific jump shot.

665
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:12,464
Honest to goodness,
if he grows another six feet...

666
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,007
...he's gonna be unstoppable.

667
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:16,093
Hey, Nick. Look what Chuck got me.

668
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:17,844
-Isn't it awesome?
-Oh, yeah.

669
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:23,892
-Wait. Give me that.
-Fire! Fire! Fire!

670
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,102
Give me this.

671
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:27,271
What'd be awesome
is if you was here...

672
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,856
...to keep these linebackers
from tearing up my house.

673
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,692
Dry rot is a tricky thing.

674
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,861
You never realIy know
how much damage there is....

675
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,863
Till you get into it.

676
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:41,034
It's like I always say, it's gonna get
ugIy before it gets pretty.

677
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:44,121
Let me teIl you something.
We're gonna get your waIls back up...

678
00:43:44,289 --> 00:43:46,623
...and your home
is gonna be stronger for it.

679
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:50,544
It better be. If not, I'm holding you
personally responsible.

680
00:43:50,712 --> 00:43:53,839
So l want you to be the one
to keep your eye on this whole project.

681
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:56,550
A very close eye.
Do you understand me?

682
00:43:56,718 --> 00:43:58,510
Close eyes.

683
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:01,930
I hear you loud and clear...

684
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:04,808
...Nickeroo.

685
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:07,185
With the gun. What are you doing?

686
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,646
And put on some booties.

687
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:17,070
It's Sunday morning, Nick. lsn't it so
nice to have the house to ourseIves?

688
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:18,739
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

689
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:27,205
What? What is this?

690
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:33,795
Hey, hey, hey.

691
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:35,922
-What's up, Nick?
-What you doing?

692
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,008
You said keep a close eye
on the project.

693
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:40,427
So you going camping?

694
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:43,930
That's crazy talk. I'm moving in.

695
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:47,768
Chuck, what about your wife?
Doesn't she want you home?

696
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,978
I don't even want him home.
I know she don't.

697
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:54,274
Don't worry about the missus. Ellie's
on tour over in China for three months.

698
00:44:56,277 --> 00:44:57,402
Three months?

699
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,780
Yeah. She's a country singer.

700
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:03,241
You wouldn't believe the way
the Chinese love their country music.

701
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:05,410
But this ain't gonna take
three months.

702
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:08,121
You're right. Could take Ionger.

703
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:11,958
But don't worry about me.
You won't even know I'm here.

704
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:17,172
What do you say? Let's get
out there before the sun gets too hot.

705
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:20,425
-Get out where?
-Chuck's taking us fishing.

706
00:45:20,593 --> 00:45:22,803
The sturgeon are running.
It's gonna be fantastic.

707
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,639
-You wanna come?
-Oh, Chuck, that is a great idea.

708
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:27,974
No, no, I can't go fishing.
That's a bad idea.

709
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,602
-Why?
-I got too much work to do.

710
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:34,022
I gotta set traps in case
that racoon comes back.

711
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,483
You know those are
vicious animaIs, baby.

712
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:38,944
Oh, come on, Nick.
The water's not that deep.

713
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:40,487
I don't care about that.

714
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:43,073
Wait a minute, Nick,
are you afraid of the water?

715
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:45,742
-Honey.
-No. That's ridiculous.

716
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:49,413
By "no" he means yes, and by
"ridiculous" he means terrified.

717
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:53,417
And he did promise
that he'd teach Kevin how to fish.

718
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:57,212
Okay. All right. Fine.
I'll go fishing.

719
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,005
Fine.

720
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,549
-Yes!
-Thanks, Chuck.

721
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:01,842
-Yes!
-Don't mention it.

722
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:12,602
I hate this. I'm gonna let y'all
know right now, I hate this.

723
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,647
-Come on.
-You know what? I--

724
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:19,526
I think I just swalIowed a bug.

725
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:30,495
Y'all see that?

726
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,664
Stop messing around, Nick.
Come on.

727
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:36,877
For real, I think we need a bigger boat.
I'm not pIaying.

728
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,337
No, come on. Just take your rod...

729
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:41,548
...and cast away.

730
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,301
Don't telI me nothing
about fishing, okay?

731
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:47,596
I was the king of Go Fish
in my neighbourhood.

732
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:49,723
This shouldn't be hard, just--

733
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:10,076
I saw a shark down there.

734
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:13,538
Oh, Nick, nice barrel rolI.
Just reaI nice.

735
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:16,458
That's it. I'm gone. I'm gone.

736
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:27,594
-Hey, Nick?
-What?

737
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:28,887
I'd be carefuI.

738
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:32,974
Don't worry about me,
I'm on land now. I got this.

739
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:38,605
Help!

740
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,734
Help. Somebody.

741
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:49,449
I gotta fire Chuck.

742
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:51,451
Why, because he made you
go fishing?

743
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:54,162
No, because he's tearing up
our house.

744
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:57,749
Well, it's gonna get ugly
before it gets pretty, Nick.

745
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,836
Don't you start quoting him
like he's some kind of oracle...

746
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:04,005
...because he's not. He's an idiot.

747
00:48:04,173 --> 00:48:06,258
He's sweet.

748
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:10,220
What?

749
00:48:10,805 --> 00:48:11,972
Nothing.

750
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:17,644
Oh, Nick, I know, I know.
This has been so hard for everybody...

751
00:48:17,812 --> 00:48:20,730
...with this house,
and you're used to being a bachelor...

752
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:25,068
...and now you've got me and the kids
and the responsibiIities of this house.

753
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,696
I know you're under
a lot of pressure, honey.

754
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:31,324
Oh, my goodness.
Come here. Feel this.

755
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:33,618
Touch it, right here.

756
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:34,953
Do you feel him?

757
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:38,790
What is that, his butt?

758
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:40,250
I think so.

759
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:43,003
Isn't that the coolest thing?

760
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,172
Did you hear that?

761
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,507
-Boy.
-Did you hear that?

762
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:50,176
-Honey, is that the racoon?
-No.

763
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:54,848
Racoon made a scuffling sound.
That was more like a rustle.

764
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,147
I think it's in the chimney.

765
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:19,331
I guess I showed him.

766
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:20,707
Yeah.

767
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:23,543
-Yeah.
-Yeah, baby.

768
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:27,380
That's right. You might
wanna close that flue, though.

769
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:39,893
Leave me alone, man. Get back.

770
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:05,168
Looks like we better put a cap
on that chimney.

771
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:07,962
These guys wiIl drive you batty.

772
00:50:09,215 --> 00:50:10,674
Night, neighbour.

773
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,467
I'm sick of you.

774
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,019
Chuck!

775
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:31,986
What?

776
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,199
-Hey, Chuck.
-Yeah?

777
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:37,909
What's going on
with my gIass door?

778
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:40,120
Frame rotted. Ripped it out,
ordered a new one.

779
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:43,123
TripIe-pane xenon-filled.
Pricey, yes...

780
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:46,710
...but it'lI probably pay for itself
in 1 5, 20 years max.

781
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,045
What's going on?
I need the water back.

782
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:52,674
I'm guessing you didn't get
the memo.

783
00:50:52,842 --> 00:50:57,554
I posted it on the fridge late
last night. "Water off, 8 a.m. sharp."

784
00:50:57,722 --> 00:51:02,058
And I don't want you to spiral into
a worry tizzy about the H2O.

785
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:04,477
It turns out your water
is pure as driven snow.

786
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:07,647
It's the pipes that are the probIem.
They're compIetely corroded.

787
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:08,815
You wanna show him?

788
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:13,236
I pulled this disgusting piece of pipe
from under your house.

789
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:15,155
Can you see through that?

790
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:17,824
Yeah, l didn't think so.

791
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:20,201
If that was your artery,
you'd be dead by now.

792
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:23,329
Or one side of your body would be,
like, totally paralyzed.

793
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:28,001
Show him just exactly what
you plan to repIace it with.

794
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:31,755
This is 1-inch copper piping.

795
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:35,008
I'm gonna use this for the verticals,
haIf-inch for the horizontals.

796
00:51:35,176 --> 00:51:38,344
Your water pressure's gonna be
hovering at around 1 50 psi...

797
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:39,679
...give or take a psi.

798
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:41,347
Is that good?

799
00:51:43,976 --> 00:51:45,852
That is insane.

800
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:49,147
Insane, huh?
Insane sounds expensive.

801
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:56,654
Hey, Chuck, I like this guy.

802
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:59,199
-He's the best. The best.
-He's funny.

803
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:03,244
AIl right, feIlas,
let's go lay some pipe.

804
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:12,420
Come on, feIlas, this way.
Through the bedroom.

805
00:52:14,215 --> 00:52:16,591
So Chuck thinks we should try
the Bradley Method.

806
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:19,427
What's the BradIey Method?

807
00:52:19,595 --> 00:52:21,721
It's natural childbirth.

808
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:23,515
You know what eIse
he was telIing me?

809
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,850
We shouId actuaIly consider
a home birth.

810
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:30,230
Home birth? With doctors coming
all in the house and stuff?

811
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,065
-Yeah.
-I'm not sure.

812
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:35,401
Okay. Well, you know,
we could always have a midwife.

813
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:37,487
You mean Chuck?

814
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:39,072
He studied in Switzerland.

815
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,241
-So?
-What do you mean, "so"?

816
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,910
I don't want him
coming nowhere near you.

817
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:48,331
The thought of Chuck
just makes my stomach hurt.

818
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:53,837
AIl right. Well, I guess
we'lI just have to talk about it later.

819
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,422
Good night.

820
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:59,717
-Chuck.
-Nick.

821
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:07,851
Chuck.

822
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,900
Hey there, little buddy.

823
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,237
Chuck making
your stomach hurt too?

824
00:53:20,114 --> 00:53:22,740
Yeah, go ahead,
heIp yourself. lt's okay.

825
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:25,743
You seem like a nice guy.

826
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:28,705
Come to me.

827
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:34,961
Hey there, little buddy.

828
00:53:36,297 --> 00:53:38,673
You wanna be my friend, don't you?

829
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:40,884
Well, truth be told, l need a--

830
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:07,118
Where is she?

831
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:09,120
She went to a party
at Danny's house.

832
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:10,788
Dry-rot Danny?

833
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:27,031
Thanks for picking me up, man.

834
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:29,784
I remember sneaking out of
my bedroom when l was that age.

835
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:34,080
Sweet, stoIen kisses in the night.

836
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:37,000
-Sometimes more than kisses, right?
-Wrong.

837
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,336
-Right? Right?
-Wrong. Wrong.

838
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:45,133
Whatever they're doing,
I'm sure it's perfectly innocent.

839
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,844
For goodness' sake,
she's almost grown up. She's 1 5.

840
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:50,763
She's only 1 3.
Practically a baby, man.

841
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:53,933
I reaIly don't wanna have this
conversation with you.

842
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,310
Enough of this.

843
00:55:57,271 --> 00:56:00,481
Easy there, partner. That's my wife.

844
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:03,026
-That's your wife?
-Yeah.

845
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,486
-This is your wife?
-Right there.

846
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:18,124
I love the way your family
treats you like an aduIt.

847
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:22,128
Ever since Mom married Nick,
I've been treated like a kid.

848
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:27,800
Well, you're way too
grown-up and pretty for that.

849
00:56:31,263 --> 00:56:33,181
-Lindsey.
-Nick?

850
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:38,311
You're busted. Now, get up,
because you're grounded.

851
00:56:38,479 --> 00:56:39,645
And you, you fired.

852
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:43,441
Whoa, whoa, whoa, brah.
Hang Ioose.

853
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:50,740
Brah. You fired too. And your little
brother. So hang loose with that, brah.

854
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:52,325
I hate you.

855
00:56:52,493 --> 00:56:56,537
Well, I'm not exactly your biggest fan
right now either. Go wait in the car.

856
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:58,164
Chuck, let's go.

857
00:57:04,004 --> 00:57:08,508
Chuck!

858
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:10,635
Oh, Nick.

859
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:21,437
That was quite a night last night,
huh, Nick?

860
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:23,272
Hey, Linds-o.

861
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,358
Good morning, Lindsey.

862
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:28,027
Lindsey. Good morning.

863
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:30,029
Good morning.

864
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:32,907
Looks like she's still mad at you.

865
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:36,744
Yeah, well, this ain't
a popularity contest.

866
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:39,539
Nick?

867
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:45,461
Chuck! Come here, man.

868
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:50,591
Need a hug?

869
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:53,219
No, I don't need a hug.
I need my floors back.

870
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,723
It's termites, Nick.
Straight up had to go.

871
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:06,691
Want that hug now?

872
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,485
I'm getting tired of this.

873
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,576
You have one message.

874
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:19,745
Mr. Persons,
love the magazine idea.

875
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:22,957
But you are one month late
with the cover.

876
00:58:23,125 --> 00:58:25,209
I've stalled the board
as long as l can.

877
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:26,961
Now it's my job on the line.

878
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:31,257
So, Nick, if you can't get Magic,
we'll have to move on.

879
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:34,594
Of course, that means refunding
your substantial cash advance.

880
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,679
I know you understand.

881
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:39,599
Thanks, doll. Call me.

882
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:51,277
And, wives, let's inhale,
taking in another deep breath.

883
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:53,821
And give it away on sound.

884
00:58:56,783 --> 00:59:01,412
There we are.
And wives are now completeIy relaxed.

885
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:02,705
What's going on here?

886
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:04,457
Nick.

887
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:06,792
We're doing a sympathetic
breathing and birth--

888
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,044
Shut up.

889
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,796
I can't believe you're doing this
with him.

890
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:12,798
I can't believe you forgot
about our class.

891
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:14,967
Inhaling and staying in the exercise.

892
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:18,721
I'm trying to fix our house, which is
supposed to be Chuck's job.

893
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:21,098
Don't blame Chuck.
He's helping me right now.

894
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:24,310
Big breath. Big breath.

895
00:59:26,647 --> 00:59:28,147
By rubbing all on you?

896
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,524
No, Nick, by supporting me.

897
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:32,401
I support you.

898
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:33,986
I support her.

899
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:37,949
I'm just trying to build our dream
house for us and the kids, that's aIl.

900
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:42,453
Y'all just get back to reIaxing.
Rub on the belly or something.

901
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:47,416
You know, one of our mantras,
Nick, is that coupling is participation.

902
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:48,668
I know.

903
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,836
What we're gonna do now
is take our hand...

904
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:55,841
...and go in a circular motion
around and around....

905
00:59:56,009 --> 01:00:01,013
That's the baby's house,
be very gentle. Around.

906
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:03,099
This may not be
the best time to teIl you...

907
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:04,892
...your house needs
a new foundation.

908
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:07,979
Don't Iet that interrupt the flow.

909
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:12,024
-That's it! That's it!
-Nick!

910
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:16,028
Come on, Nick.

911
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:19,532
Somebody's having a bad day.
Now, be careful with that.

912
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:23,035
That is New England mahogany trim!
I bent over backwards to get it for you.

913
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:25,246
-What is up, Nick?
-This is what's up.

914
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,666
-You played me!
-No.

915
01:00:28,834 --> 01:00:31,836
You knew this was a piece ofjunk
the minute you sold it to me.

916
01:00:32,004 --> 01:00:33,629
I knew the minute I met you...

917
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:36,841
...that this home was meant for you!
You just needed a littIe push.

918
01:00:37,009 --> 01:00:38,426
Well, here's my push.

919
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:41,971
I should warn you, Nick.

920
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:45,808
I am trained in capoeira,
the Brazilian dance of war.

921
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:49,312
Yeah, l don't know karate,
but I know crazy.

922
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,902
Oh, Nick!

923
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:01,198
No!

924
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:06,412
That was a close one. Once it gets
going, man, is it hard to stop.

925
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:09,915
Get off me. You are fired!

926
01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:14,337
What? Nick. Nickelback. Come on,
you can't blame me for all this.

927
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:18,090
No. I can. And I will. And I do!

928
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:21,761
I blame you for everything, Chuck.
It's aIl your fault.

929
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:25,931
I'm bIaming you for the ozone layer,
global warming, the price on gas.

930
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,475
It's aIl your fault.

931
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:32,438
So get off my property,
get out my face and get out my life.

932
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:37,485
No, no, no, Nick. The good news here
is that all we need is some therapy.

933
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:41,113
Nick, we can work our way
through this, and guess what.

934
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:44,575
I'm a Iicensed couples therapist.
I am.

935
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:47,828
I see this tension happening
between contractors and cIients...

936
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:48,996
...aIl the time.

937
01:01:49,164 --> 01:01:50,998
It's the bread and butter
of my practise.

938
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:53,250
But just admit this one thing to me.
One thing.

939
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:54,752
What?

940
01:01:55,379 --> 01:01:58,923
You never would've bought
this place if it hadn't been for me.

941
01:01:59,299 --> 01:02:00,508
Exactly.

942
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:03,636
Why is that? l'Il tell you why.
I'll tell you why that is.

943
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:06,972
Because I knew what you didn't.

944
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:10,893
Yes, l knew there was
more work to be done here.

945
01:02:11,186 --> 01:02:13,604
But l also knew the value
of this place.

946
01:02:13,772 --> 01:02:15,398
I knew that when you were done...

947
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,817
...that this was gonna
be a home for your family...

948
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:21,946
...not some stinking house. l got them
up to here, they're a dime a dozen.

949
01:02:22,114 --> 01:02:24,782
But a home, a home, Nick.

950
01:02:25,617 --> 01:02:27,284
This is it.

951
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:28,994
Your home.

952
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:32,665
Does this look like a home to you?

953
01:02:35,544 --> 01:02:37,878
This is a mess!

954
01:02:38,046 --> 01:02:40,923
I need you out of here, right now.

955
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,217
Well, if you--

956
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:47,972
If you can't see the value of a home
as opposed to a house...

957
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:51,350
...maybe l'm not your guy.

958
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:01,777
Where y'aIl going?

959
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:04,238
It's called loyalty, Mr. Persons.

960
01:03:04,406 --> 01:03:08,451
We work for Chuck.
And if he goes, we go.

961
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:10,244
Well, then go.

962
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:13,998
I don't need none of you.
I can do it myself.

963
01:03:31,683 --> 01:03:33,893
I don't know what you
were thinking, Nick.

964
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:37,646
You're gonna have to realise that
we're gonna have to hire Chuck back.

965
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,941
What? Oh, no, no.
That's never gonna happen, alI right?

966
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:42,485
Nobody takes me for a ride...

967
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:45,237
...so he's never stepping foot
in this house again.

968
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:48,824
Chuck is caring, and he cares
about this family.

969
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:52,244
What he needs to do is move back
with his own family.

970
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:55,915
It's not normal for a contractor
to live with his clients, Suzanne.

971
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:59,126
I understand that, but it's been
fun having him around, Nick...

972
01:03:59,294 --> 01:04:00,920
...and he's great with the kids.

973
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:05,508
No, he's not. He's the one tearing this
famiIy apart, that's what he's doing.

974
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,594
He's the one tearing
this famiIy apart?

975
01:04:09,221 --> 01:04:11,388
You're the one tearing
this famiIy apart, Nick.

976
01:04:12,641 --> 01:04:14,308
-Me?
-Yes, you.

977
01:04:14,476 --> 01:04:17,561
With your insane obsession
with this house.

978
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:20,105
You don't have to worry
about that anymore.

979
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:21,732
Got the perfect idea.

980
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,943
This house is driving
everybody crazy...

981
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,820
...so I say we just move on
and cut our losses.

982
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:29,532
Oh, and where are we gonna go,
Nick, to your condo?

983
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:31,033
Anywhere but here.

984
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:38,123
Nick. Nick. We cannot keep
uprooting our family Iike this.

985
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:40,960
Who was the one crying
that we needed a bigger place?

986
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:43,462
AIl right? Now, l wouIdn't
be stuck with this dump...

987
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:46,715
...if it wasn't for you
and these ungrateful kids.

988
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:49,385
Nick.

989
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:52,805
Suzanne, I didn't mean that. Come--

990
01:04:52,973 --> 01:04:56,016
-HoId on. I didn't mean that.
-No. No. Don't touch me right now.

991
01:04:56,726 --> 01:04:58,811
I'm just under so much pressure.

992
01:04:58,979 --> 01:05:00,396
And I'm not under pressure?

993
01:05:00,564 --> 01:05:04,316
I'm the one who's having babies
that I'm not even sure you want.

994
01:05:18,498 --> 01:05:20,666
I reaIly think you're overreacting.

995
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:24,962
I think we need to spend
some time apart, Nick.

996
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:28,132
Come on, now.

997
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:32,344
When we first got here, these kids
were not happy about being here...

998
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:34,179
...but now they're vested in this.

999
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:37,933
So, what are we gonna do? Just take
that all away because it's difficult?

1000
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:39,852
Is that the thing you
wanna teach Kevin?

1001
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:42,605
That when the going gets tough,
you just quit?

1002
01:05:43,732 --> 01:05:47,151
You shouId try putting that
on the cover of your magazine.

1003
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:50,613
Look at you. I mean,
you quitting on me right now.

1004
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:54,533
I am not quitting,
I just need time to think.

1005
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:57,953
Suzanne.

1006
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:01,248
Where you gonna go?

1007
01:06:08,423 --> 01:06:10,049
Oh, not you guys too?

1008
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:11,967
Just cutting our Iosses.

1009
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:13,636
Kevin, I know you understand.

1010
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:15,220
Not now, Nick, l'm busy.

1011
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:17,848
Well, you're gonna thank me
when we out of here.

1012
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:21,060
You city kids and you know it.

1013
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:25,314
Coco, get in the house.

1014
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,610
I said, get in the house,
you ignorant mutt.

1015
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:31,654
Coco!

1016
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:38,744
Coco.

1017
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:44,041
I'm sorry.

1018
01:09:00,512 --> 01:09:02,095
What you doing?

1019
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:06,058
Jason Winchell caught an 8-pound
bass and brought it to school.

1020
01:09:06,226 --> 01:09:08,018
Well, actually, just the head.

1021
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:11,897
But it was so big, you could fit
your whoIe hand in its mouth.

1022
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:14,691
Chuck was supposed
to take me fishing.

1023
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:17,569
That is, until you fired him.

1024
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:20,614
You know what?
Why don't we just go now?

1025
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:22,991
RealIy?

1026
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,993
Come on. Let's try it.

1027
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:37,840
Hey. I know it's been kind of hard,
making the move and all.

1028
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:40,300
And I haven't actually been around.

1029
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:43,512
Well, I've been around,
but I haven't been around, around.

1030
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,097
Know what I mean?

1031
01:09:45,265 --> 01:09:48,642
-Yeah.
-Well...

1032
01:09:48,810 --> 01:09:51,687
...l'm here to let you know
that all that's gonna change.

1033
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:54,523
Because FYI...

1034
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:56,900
...l think you're a cool son.

1035
01:09:57,902 --> 01:09:59,611
Thanks.

1036
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:02,072
And you're a cool dad.

1037
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:06,326
Kevin!

1038
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:19,673
What was that?

1039
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:22,509
I don't know.
But he messed with the wrong kid.

1040
01:10:24,304 --> 01:10:25,888
Get him, Nick!

1041
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:43,947
I got him! Stay back!

1042
01:10:44,115 --> 01:10:46,783
Yeah! You tell Jason Winchell
that the fish he caught...

1043
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:50,579
...wasn't nothing but bait, baby!
Yeah!

1044
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:56,501
Hey, hey. Hold up.

1045
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:58,337
Forgetting something.

1046
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:00,505
Lunch money.

1047
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:03,008
Thanks. Bye.

1048
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:08,305
-How's your mother?
-She's fine.

1049
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:12,059
You're not gonna have
a heart attack out here, are you?

1050
01:11:12,602 --> 01:11:15,479
If l do, just pulI my body
behind the shed.

1051
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:17,773
My pleasure.

1052
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:20,692
Lindsey.

1053
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:24,029
I know you're still mad at me,
but I'm trying to get it right.

1054
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:28,158
It's a new family, a new house.
It's aIl new to me.

1055
01:11:28,326 --> 01:11:31,119
But l'Il try to be
more understanding.

1056
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:35,248
Okay, okay, okay. I probably should've
handled the party a little differently.

1057
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:39,878
I'm sorry, Nick.
I should've asked you.

1058
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:42,839
Does this mean
I can see Danny again?

1059
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,592
Don't push it.

1060
01:11:46,386 --> 01:11:48,679
Go ahead and make your bus.

1061
01:11:49,430 --> 01:11:52,516
-Good morning, Mr. Rooney.
-Hey, hi, sweetie.

1062
01:11:54,394 --> 01:11:58,689
Hey. This is for you.
Thought maybe you could use this.

1063
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:00,565
How's the house coming?

1064
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,234
It's coming.

1065
01:12:02,402 --> 01:12:03,902
Hey, how is Chuck doing?

1066
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:05,362
Don't know and don't care.

1067
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:10,242
Boy, l hope he's okay.
This is a tough time of year for him.

1068
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:11,910
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

1069
01:12:12,078 --> 01:12:15,455
His wife. He lost his wife a few years
back around this time of year.

1070
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:18,333
You didn't know, did you?

1071
01:12:19,127 --> 01:12:21,712
Oh, yeah, she was
really something special.

1072
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:24,006
He's never been the same since.

1073
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:26,925
She was his entire worId.

1074
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:48,321
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

1075
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:50,365
I heard about ElIie.

1076
01:12:52,243 --> 01:12:53,785
Come in.

1077
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:15,599
Hey, I got a littIe organic
herbal maté going here.

1078
01:13:15,767 --> 01:13:17,350
Thanks.

1079
01:13:18,478 --> 01:13:21,980
-Can l tell you something?
-Yeah, shoot.

1080
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:25,442
When I was working on
your home with you...

1081
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:27,194
...to me...

1082
01:13:27,987 --> 01:13:29,905
...it felt like family.

1083
01:13:30,073 --> 01:13:35,535
It feIt like the special stuff,
you know? The stuff you hang on to.

1084
01:13:35,703 --> 01:13:38,789
Stuff that's gone missing
around here for quite some time.

1085
01:13:39,457 --> 01:13:40,832
It's funny, I....

1086
01:13:42,085 --> 01:13:44,628
I can't even go inside anymore.

1087
01:13:46,547 --> 01:13:48,423
Look, Nick...

1088
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:51,426
...l know I screwed your life up.

1089
01:13:51,594 --> 01:13:56,181
And I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry,
you got no idea.

1090
01:13:56,349 --> 01:13:58,725
You didn't screw my life up.

1091
01:13:58,893 --> 01:14:00,644
I did.

1092
01:14:01,604 --> 01:14:04,147
And you'll always
be a part of my family.

1093
01:14:09,028 --> 01:14:11,738
I actualIy came over here
to make sure you was okay.

1094
01:14:12,115 --> 01:14:16,451
I was so upset about how things
were going over at your place, I just....

1095
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:21,998
I went ahead and let Magic know that
you realIy, really need to speak to him.

1096
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:26,086
Man, that's great. That's great, man.
I reaIly need it.

1097
01:14:26,254 --> 01:14:29,381
While I was at it, I also happened
to have put my ReaItor's cap on...

1098
01:14:29,549 --> 01:14:31,466
...and I made a couple
of phone calls.

1099
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:33,927
I got a Russian banker
coming out here next Friday.

1100
01:14:34,095 --> 01:14:35,720
Just might be very motivated.

1101
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:39,266
If you get the roof up on that place,
you might be abIe to flip it.

1102
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:43,228
Get out from underneath
the whole thing.

1103
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:46,064
Well, Iet me get the roof on.

1104
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:50,902
Do you have a nail gun with the
air compressor? The whole unit?

1105
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:53,196
No. I'm oId-school with it.

1106
01:14:53,364 --> 01:14:57,534
Oh, you're doing it old-schooI
between now and next Friday?

1107
01:14:58,077 --> 01:15:01,246
Maybe just borrow mine.
That'd be good.

1108
01:15:01,956 --> 01:15:05,375
Thanks, Chuck.
Thanks for everything.

1109
01:15:05,751 --> 01:15:07,252
You got it.

1110
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:41,286
You can ground me later,
but right now, you need help.

1111
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:51,588
Mr. P, the Iittle Pulu
has something to tell you.

1112
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:57,135
I'm sorry about the party.

1113
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:00,055
I should have never taken
Lindsey without asking you.

1114
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:02,098
You got that right.

1115
01:16:02,475 --> 01:16:04,726
And if it's all right with you...

1116
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:07,562
...me and my brothers would
really like to finish this job.

1117
01:16:10,358 --> 01:16:14,694
Hey, fellas! I got some great news.
Tremendous news.

1118
01:16:14,862 --> 01:16:17,864
We are not just working
on a house anymore.

1119
01:16:18,032 --> 01:16:21,326
From now on, we're committing
to finishing a home.

1120
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:25,121
You heard it, baby.
We're gonna finish Nick's home.

1121
01:16:25,289 --> 01:16:27,040
Check that for dry rot.

1122
01:16:27,667 --> 01:16:30,752
You. I'm so darn proud
of you right now.

1123
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:34,047
You're making me feeI a little
"Nickeladocious," I'm not gonna lie.

1124
01:16:34,215 --> 01:16:37,842
I just wanna give you a hug on your
Nickelback, my old "Nickabocker."

1125
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,844
My Nick at Nite.

1126
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:41,846
Enough!

1127
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:45,642
Well, you caught me just
in the "Nick o' time."

1128
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,561
Is it a blessing or a curse?

1129
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:41,406
Go ahead, try it.

1130
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:47,954
Let's go. Hey, hey, hey.

1131
01:17:56,797 --> 01:17:58,423
-Suzanne.
-Nick.

1132
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:01,384
Now, before you say anything,
I need to get this out, okay?

1133
01:18:01,552 --> 01:18:04,846
-Okay.
-Now, you was right, and I was a fool.

1134
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:06,931
The house is just a house...

1135
01:18:07,892 --> 01:18:10,435
...and it'd never be a home
without you and the kids and--

1136
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:14,105
-Yes, baby, l get it.
-I'm almost finished.

1137
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:17,901
Would you please consider forgiving
me and coming back home?

1138
01:18:18,277 --> 01:18:19,402
Babies.

1139
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:22,322
Babies? You know, we can work
on that once you drop those two.

1140
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:24,074
I don't think it's
a good idea to--

1141
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:26,910
-Babies.
-Babies?

1142
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:29,871
-Babies, Nick!
-Oh, babies!

1143
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:32,916
Okay. Let me get you to the car.
Come on. Come on.

1144
01:18:33,084 --> 01:18:35,377
-Honey, how far is the hospitaI?
-About a half-hour.

1145
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:37,045
Nick, we can't wait that long!

1146
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:40,757
We gotta. That's where the doctors
and nurses and aIl the equipment--

1147
01:18:40,925 --> 01:18:44,135
-You're hurting my hand now.
-Honey, it is happening now!

1148
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:45,637
-Now?
-Now!

1149
01:18:45,805 --> 01:18:48,306
Okay, kids, get them bags
in the house.

1150
01:18:48,474 --> 01:18:52,185
Look, your mom about to have what
she always wanted, a home birth.

1151
01:18:53,354 --> 01:18:56,523
Oh, Nick. I Iove the floors. Teak?

1152
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:58,983
Oh, no. That's bubinga.

1153
01:19:01,779 --> 01:19:06,241
Nick, slow it down. I'm hot, honey.
I'm hot. Get it off.

1154
01:19:06,409 --> 01:19:07,992
Well, what now?

1155
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,245
I don't know. l thought you knew.

1156
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:15,667
What you trying to say, baby?

1157
01:19:15,835 --> 01:19:17,127
Chuck!

1158
01:19:17,294 --> 01:19:20,839
Chuck? l'Il go this way!
I'll go this way!

1159
01:19:21,006 --> 01:19:23,174
Oh, Nick, I'm gonna kilI you.

1160
01:19:23,342 --> 01:19:26,052
- For what?
-You did this to me.

1161
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:30,348
Hello? Nickster, how we--?

1162
01:19:30,516 --> 01:19:32,142
You what?

1163
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:40,775
Okay. Keep this line open.
Chuck is in the truck.

1164
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:54,581
Oh, come on!

1165
01:20:01,172 --> 01:20:03,047
Okay.

1166
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:05,425
Baby, is he on his way?

1167
01:20:05,593 --> 01:20:07,510
That was him.
He's on his way. Don't worry.

1168
01:20:07,678 --> 01:20:09,554
-Everything gonna be fine.
-Are you sure?

1169
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:11,639
Go wait for Chuck downstairs.

1170
01:20:19,315 --> 01:20:22,901
Hello? Nick? Chuck had
a littIe troubIe with the truck.

1171
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:24,569
But don't worry, I'm on my way.

1172
01:20:24,737 --> 01:20:26,196
Man, just telI me what to do.

1173
01:20:26,363 --> 01:20:30,492
Okay, now, telI Suzanne to
stay calm, and to breathe.

1174
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:32,744
Okay, you got to stay
calm and breathe.

1175
01:20:32,912 --> 01:20:34,412
-I'm breathing.
-She's breathing.

1176
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:35,788
Now tell her to relax.

1177
01:20:35,956 --> 01:20:39,167
Maybe do the colour imaging
we worked so very hard on.

1178
01:20:39,335 --> 01:20:40,919
Baby, reIax!

1179
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:42,170
Honey, I'm relaxing.

1180
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:44,797
-Don't yeIl at me!
-Honey, I'm not yelling!

1181
01:20:44,965 --> 01:20:47,550
Keep her breathing, Nick.
Put Lindsey on the phone, pIease.

1182
01:20:47,885 --> 01:20:49,761
-He wants to talk to you.
-Why?

1183
01:20:51,138 --> 01:20:54,057
-Who knows? Here.
-Hey, Chuck.

1184
01:20:54,225 --> 01:20:56,184
I want you to listen very carefully.

1185
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:57,977
I need you to grab me some things.

1186
01:20:58,145 --> 01:21:00,605
l need a bucket of hot water,
an oral thermometer...

1187
01:21:00,773 --> 01:21:04,776
...latex gloves, towels, a shoestring
and some jaIapeño hot sauce.

1188
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:07,278
Hot sauce?

1189
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:09,364
Get that for me.
Put Nick on the phone.

1190
01:21:09,532 --> 01:21:11,407
-Okay, Chuck.
-I am aImost there.

1191
01:21:11,575 --> 01:21:14,536
I want you to go into the bathroom
and get some hand sanitizer.

1192
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:15,870
Don't telI me what to do.

1193
01:21:16,038 --> 01:21:19,082
I'm gonna go in the bathroom
and find the hand sanitizer.

1194
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:21,584
Okay, got it. What now?

1195
01:21:21,752 --> 01:21:23,920
We're gonna use that
to sterilize your hands.

1196
01:21:24,088 --> 01:21:25,463
Why? I'm not touching nothing.

1197
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:26,965
Nick, you are.

1198
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:30,134
Oh, God, they're coming! Honey?

1199
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:34,138
How far apart would you say
the contractions are?

1200
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:36,766
Fast and furious, Chuck.
Fast and furious.

1201
01:21:36,934 --> 01:21:38,977
PilIow! l need a piIlow.

1202
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:40,478
Okay, game time, baby.

1203
01:21:40,646 --> 01:21:44,566
Go down there and see if
the first baby is crowning.

1204
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:46,109
Come on, man, what that mean?

1205
01:21:46,277 --> 01:21:48,486
Can you see the baby?

1206
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:56,744
Oh, God.

1207
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:58,705
It's like the guppies all over again.

1208
01:21:58,872 --> 01:22:00,623
-Honey?
-Chuck, he's down.

1209
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:03,001
That's what the
jalapeño hot sauce is for.

1210
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:05,336
Give him a little dash of that.

1211
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:08,131
Hold on.

1212
01:22:16,890 --> 01:22:17,890
He's back.

1213
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:21,352
-Put your father back on the phone.
-Yeah.

1214
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:25,231
I need you to go in there,
grab that baby's head, gently.

1215
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:27,108
For God's sake, gently.

1216
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:31,654
Give it a pull. Then take the
shoestring and tie off the cord.

1217
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:37,410
-HeIlo? Hello?
-HeIlo? Hello?

1218
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:42,206
I lost him. Are you sure
you don't wanna try a hospital?

1219
01:22:43,876 --> 01:22:45,752
Guess that means no.

1220
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:49,505
Oh, so cIose. I just missed
the state record. Let's--

1221
01:22:49,673 --> 01:22:51,841
-How's the patient doing here?
-Oh, Chuck.

1222
01:22:52,009 --> 01:22:53,426
Let's go into our fun breathing.

1223
01:22:53,594 --> 01:22:56,179
Let's go into a deep, warm pIace,
and a quiet place.

1224
01:22:56,347 --> 01:22:58,640
Okay, quiet and deep.

1225
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:05,271
FamiIy, let's breathe together.

1226
01:23:06,857 --> 01:23:08,232
Now we're releasing on sound.

1227
01:23:11,403 --> 01:23:14,405
Nick, I can't take that noise.
I can't take that noise.

1228
01:23:14,573 --> 01:23:17,241
Hey, look, l'm having a baby.
I can't taIk right now.

1229
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:21,204
-Yo, Nick, it's Earvin Johnson.
-Magic?

1230
01:23:21,372 --> 01:23:23,247
Chuck Mitchell said you need
to talk to me.

1231
01:23:23,415 --> 01:23:26,042
Look, my wife having a baby
right now. We can't talk.

1232
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:29,045
I remember when I had mine.

1233
01:23:30,422 --> 01:23:32,382
Yup. That's how l remembered it.

1234
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:37,428
Tell Magic Chuck-dog said,
"Holler. Much respect. You the man."

1235
01:23:37,596 --> 01:23:41,057
Chuck-dog said,
"Much respect. You the man."

1236
01:23:41,225 --> 01:23:43,559
Tell Chuck-dog he's the man.

1237
01:23:44,603 --> 01:23:46,187
Yo, Chuck, he said you the man.

1238
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:47,814
Oh, natch. That's so Magic.

1239
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:51,192
Hey, man, what's up with the
Lakers, man? Y'all need a centre.

1240
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:52,902
He wants to talk to you, Chuck.

1241
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:54,779
Roundy-round. Roundy-round.

1242
01:23:54,947 --> 01:23:56,280
Hello?

1243
01:23:56,448 --> 01:23:58,366
You got your hands fulI over there.

1244
01:23:58,534 --> 01:24:00,952
Ask Nick if he has
any more questions for me.

1245
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,579
You have any questions
for the greatest point guard...

1246
01:24:03,747 --> 01:24:05,081
...in the history of the NBA?

1247
01:24:05,374 --> 01:24:08,459
Oh, yeah. In that '85 series
against the Celtics...

1248
01:24:08,627 --> 01:24:10,795
...was that a true crossover?
Because it Iooked--

1249
01:24:10,963 --> 01:24:12,422
Knock it off!

1250
01:24:12,589 --> 01:24:14,716
So gotta go. Bye, Buck.

1251
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:17,385
-I need you, baby.
-Look, it's showtime now, okay?

1252
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:21,973
-We got this. We got this. All right?
-Okay. We got this. Okay.

1253
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:27,520
Oh, God.

1254
01:24:31,150 --> 01:24:32,358
Told you it'd be beautiful.

1255
01:24:33,777 --> 01:24:38,698
Oh, before l forget, I got you
kind of a homewarming gift.

1256
01:24:40,534 --> 01:24:41,576
AIl the best.

1257
01:24:43,454 --> 01:24:44,537
Yo, Chuck.

1258
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:48,916
Thanks for coming back, man.

1259
01:24:49,376 --> 01:24:51,753
You kidding me?
I'm stuck on you, Nick.

1260
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:12,732
And so it goes.

1261
01:25:12,900 --> 01:25:15,526
You know, sometimes life
throws you a changeup...

1262
01:25:15,694 --> 01:25:18,488
...and you've just got to adjust.

1263
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:24,452
I never did finish
the sports magazine.

1264
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:27,705
Instead, l started something
completely different.

1265
01:25:27,873 --> 01:25:31,042
A different magazine,
a lot closer to my heart...

1266
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:33,586
...inspired by rebuilding this house.

1267
01:25:33,754 --> 01:25:36,839
It's called Are We Done Yet?

1268
01:25:37,007 --> 01:25:40,718
And that's the story on how
we built our dream house.

1269
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:44,764
Thank you.

1270
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:51,854
So l want to thank you all for coming.
Enjoy the party.
