00:00:35,753 --> 00:00:37,485
I's a beautiful
sunny afternoon

3
00:00:37,487 --> 00:00:39,088
here in the Cowboy state.

4
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,490
We've got partly cloudy skies
clearing by sundown

5
00:00:42,492 --> 00:00:44,726
and for you stargazers tonight,

6
00:00:44,728 --> 00:00:47,328
the Geminid meteor shower
is set to put on

7
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:51,167
a once-in-a-lifetime show
between 6:00 pm and 2:00 am.

8
00:00:51,169 --> 00:00:54,937
So set your sights to the
North-Northeast high in the sky.

9
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:56,671
The National Weather
Service says temps

10
00:00:56,673 --> 00:00:58,406
could dip into the mid-60s,

11
00:00:58,408 --> 00:01:01,476
so you have a beautiful night
to sit out with a sweetheart,

12
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,113
kick back, and put
something on the grill.

13
00:01:04,115 --> 00:01:07,482
And her's a fun fact from
Wyoming's Meteor Research Center

14
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,384
at Hopkin's Air Force base:

15
00:01:09,386 --> 00:01:11,821
only twice in
the showe's history

16
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:15,157
have we seen a shower lasting
longer than two hours,

17
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:18,359
and this one goes late,
late into the night,

18
00:01:18,361 --> 00:01:20,662
so it sounds like i's
going to be quite a show.

19
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:22,397
Don't go to bed early!

20
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:24,767
And I did't know this, but our
weather guy is saying to me

21
00:01:24,769 --> 00:01:27,069
that these falling stars
are actually debris from

22
00:01:27,071 --> 00:01:29,437
an asteroid that orbits the sun
every year-and-a half...

23
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,607
I's named... how do you
pronounce this?

24
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:35,277
"Fay-eh-thoon?"
Phaethon, is that it?

25
00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:36,779
Sounds close enough.

26
00:01:36,781 --> 00:01:38,848
So, we wo't be able
to see that tonight but

27
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,917
plenty of shooting stars will
be dancing across the sky.

28
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:45,620
Keep it cool, keep it fun,
keep it safe.

29
00:01:45,622 --> 00:01:47,890
Definitely be ready
for a fireworks display

30
00:01:47,892 --> 00:01:51,693
from Mother Nature to go
with your rock n roll.

31
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:57,266
Currently 68 degrees and a
jam-packed line-up at KYOS...

32
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:38,740
What began as excitement
has turned to concern

33
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,809
in rural Wyoming this morning.

34
00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:42,677
Reports have been flooding
in from NORAD

35
00:02:42,679 --> 00:02:44,213
and the International
Space Station

36
00:02:44,215 --> 00:02:47,682
of some unusual activity
related to a meteor shower

37
00:02:47,684 --> 00:02:50,786
mostly-viewable
in the Northern U .S.

38
00:02:50,788 --> 00:02:53,923
Observatories around the
world are coordinating efforts

39
00:02:53,925 --> 00:02:57,293
to assure the meteor that
made ground late yesterday

40
00:02:57,295 --> 00:02:59,594
was one isolated incident.

41
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,997
Mount Wilson Observatory
in Southern California

42
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:05,167
is closely monitoring
a group of 58 meteors.

43
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:08,304
They want to reassure the public
that there is at this point

44
00:03:08,306 --> 00:03:11,572
no cause for alarm and that
they are keeping a close eye

45
00:03:11,574 --> 00:03:14,542
- on the shower as it intensifies.
- Notches road, Notches road.

46
00:03:14,544 --> 00:03:16,111
Let me know when you see it.

47
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,246
Stand by for more
breaking news and reports

48
00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:18,479
here on KYOS Wyoming.

49
00:03:18,481 --> 00:03:21,183
Next dirt road on the right.

50
00:03:21,185 --> 00:03:23,953
Why do meteors always land
in the middle of nowhere?

51
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:26,057
I hate those country roads.

52
00:03:27,325 --> 00:03:28,960
I think we are here.

53
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:36,832
100 years, 'm like,

54
00:03:36,834 --> 00:03:38,867
my great-grandfather
built that barn, you know?

55
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:40,972
I's all I have.
I's all the money I have.

56
00:03:54,185 --> 00:03:56,686
Let's see what
we got here, huh?

57
00:04:04,195 --> 00:04:05,997
Well, let's go say hi.

58
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:13,235
How you doing, guys?

59
00:04:13,237 --> 00:04:15,337
Hello. Hi, hi.

60
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:16,472
Officer Pritchard.

61
00:04:16,474 --> 00:04:18,706
- Nice to meet you.
- Kurt.

62
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,109
Yeah, at first I thought
it was a jet

63
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:22,044
from the Air Force Base
that caught on fire

64
00:04:22,046 --> 00:04:23,912
or maybe it was a missile
that flew out of control.

65
00:04:23,914 --> 00:04:26,215
But until we got your call
to shelter in place,

66
00:04:26,217 --> 00:04:27,615
this town was in a panic.

67
00:04:27,617 --> 00:04:29,118
Yeah, well,
tha's understandable.

68
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,153
A meteor traveling
10 times the speed of sound

69
00:04:31,155 --> 00:04:32,990
will frighten anybody.

70
00:04:35,592 --> 00:04:38,559
So are you the poor woman that
just got her house destroyed?

71
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:40,029
- Yeah.
- Uh, yeah.

72
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:41,596
She was pretty shook up,
but she keeps mentioning

73
00:04:41,598 --> 00:04:43,531
how happy she is
that you guys are located

74
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,234
just a couple miles up the road.

75
00:04:45,236 --> 00:04:48,037
Yeah, are you the folks
that study the, uh, UFOs?

76
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:51,073
Uh, no.
We actually study meteors.

77
00:04:51,075 --> 00:04:53,008
Meredith, this
is Dr. Kurt Siegel.

78
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,710
H's from the base.
H's their lead meteorologist.

79
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,047
Tha's for weather, Brian.

80
00:04:58,049 --> 00:05:00,015
Actually, w're
called meteorists.

81
00:05:00,017 --> 00:05:01,850
Those weather people
claimed that cool name,

82
00:05:01,852 --> 00:05:04,286
unfortunately,
so here we are.

83
00:05:04,288 --> 00:05:06,789
Oh, yeah.
I mean, this was my house.

84
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:08,157
I just put
in fresh juniper bushes.

85
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:11,060
That explosion
even fried my radio.

86
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:13,829
So do you mind
if we go ahead

87
00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:15,431
and take a closer
look at things?

88
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:17,301
Yeah, feel free.
I's a sad sight. Come on.

89
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:24,907
All right, this way.
Watch your step.

90
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:26,341
Just got to go around here.

91
00:05:26,343 --> 00:05:29,346
There's too much damage
on the other side.

92
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,315
All right now.
Watch your step here.

93
00:05:33,317 --> 00:05:34,316
I's kinda tricky.

94
00:05:34,318 --> 00:05:35,519
- Here.
- Okay.

95
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:41,223
All right.
So it came from right over here

96
00:05:41,225 --> 00:05:44,428
and crashed the top of my house
and landed right over there.

97
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:50,134
Go ahead.

98
00:05:53,537 --> 00:05:55,039
Here, watch yourself.
Watch it.

99
00:05:56,841 --> 00:05:58,442
All right.
Watch your step.

100
00:06:01,644 --> 00:06:03,314
Watch yourself.

101
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:10,287
Look at that.

102
00:06:11,856 --> 00:06:14,423
Well, this does't make sense.

103
00:06:14,425 --> 00:06:16,391
What?

104
00:06:16,393 --> 00:06:19,194
The size of it.
I's way too big.

105
00:06:19,196 --> 00:06:21,465
Why?
What did you expect?

106
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,068
About a fraction of this.

107
00:06:25,668 --> 00:06:27,304
Tha's about six foot.

108
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:32,841
What do you think, Mara?

109
00:06:32,843 --> 00:06:35,743
If this was the size
of an actual missile,

110
00:06:35,745 --> 00:06:38,413
what would it do?

111
00:06:38,415 --> 00:06:39,982
Well, Geminids travel what?

112
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:41,583
20,000 or 30,000 miles an hour?

113
00:06:41,585 --> 00:06:43,187
Tha's right.

114
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,890
Okay.

115
00:06:47,892 --> 00:06:50,559
Well, even without a payload,
a small ICBM

116
00:06:50,561 --> 00:06:54,997
would generate the force
equivalent to a ton of TNT.

117
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:57,001
I mean, this size...

118
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:01,038
Speed?

119
00:07:04,542 --> 00:07:06,177
This whole town should be gone.

120
00:07:10,114 --> 00:07:11,480
Shit.

121
00:07:11,482 --> 00:07:13,415
How do you explain that, doc?

122
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:16,285
I'm not sure.
The only plausible explanation

123
00:07:16,287 --> 00:07:17,886
is that this meteor
was traveling

124
00:07:17,888 --> 00:07:20,189
at a much slower speed than
it should have.

125
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:21,957
W'll need a second opinion
on this.

126
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:24,028
I gotta make a call.

127
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:31,967
Hey, Gwen, it's Siegel.

128
00:07:31,969 --> 00:07:33,569
Yes, 'm at that crash site.

129
00:07:33,571 --> 00:07:36,138
There are a few things
that just don't add up here.

130
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,375
I think we could really
use your expertise.

131
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,145
Oh, you're on your way?
Good.

132
00:07:42,813 --> 00:07:44,913
Because I need you and Beth
down here STAT

133
00:07:44,915 --> 00:07:47,117
to run some element profiles.

134
00:07:49,153 --> 00:07:50,519
I can't figure out
for the life of me

135
00:07:50,521 --> 00:07:52,556
how this thing survived
the atmosphere...

136
00:07:56,961 --> 00:07:58,295
or if there will be more.

137
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,597
W're gonna need to dig
into this thing.

138
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,966
I hope you have
your field kit.

139
00:08:03,968 --> 00:08:06,702
Okay, see you in a minute.

140
00:08:06,704 --> 00:08:08,937
She asked if we could take
the helicopter to save time.

141
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:10,172
And I told her
w're not breaking

142
00:08:10,174 --> 00:08:12,074
transport protocol ever again.

143
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:13,675
Please do't tell me
you taught her

144
00:08:13,677 --> 00:08:15,312
how to fly a helicopter.

145
00:08:17,681 --> 00:08:19,348
I had a heart attack
when I found out

146
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,416
you taught her
how to fly a jet.

147
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,952
Boy, I wish I had
a chauffer to fly me around

148
00:08:23,954 --> 00:08:25,187
in a helicopter.

149
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:27,923
Title's Heavy Weapons Analyst.

150
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:29,858
But, yeah, I can
get people where they need to go

151
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,262
from time to time.

152
00:08:33,163 --> 00:08:35,297
Especially if they wanna
blow stuff up.

153
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:37,234
My apologies.

154
00:08:38,569 --> 00:08:42,170
To be fair, I did teach Gwen
the basics of flying an F-35.

155
00:08:42,172 --> 00:08:44,106
And I told her
the next time w're up,

156
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:46,110
she can take the controls.

157
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,111
So is Michael coming with her?

158
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:50,812
Michael? No.

159
00:08:50,814 --> 00:08:52,314
I's just her and Beth.

160
00:08:52,316 --> 00:08:54,118
- The're here.
- Yeah.

161
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:06,028
Gwen, I understand
your husban's

162
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,829
a hot shot colonel
now at the base.

163
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:10,666
But we do still need you in
the field from time to time.

164
00:09:10,668 --> 00:09:12,834
Sorry I'm late.
Beth is with us today.

165
00:09:12,836 --> 00:09:14,336
Beth, good to see you.

166
00:09:14,338 --> 00:09:15,971
Yeah. So, no, I'm late
because I had to start

167
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:17,372
the spectral imaging process.

168
00:09:17,374 --> 00:09:19,141
I told you that
was unnecessary, Gwen.

169
00:09:19,143 --> 00:09:21,810
My predictive models call
this a meteor shower.

170
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,912
Yeah, well, we should
talk about that.

171
00:09:23,914 --> 00:09:25,213
Yeah, we should.

172
00:09:25,215 --> 00:09:27,418
- You gotta take a look at this.
- Okay.

173
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,823
Kurt, did you happen
to see all those dead birds

174
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:36,458
in the drive in this morning?

175
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,094
Yeah. Tha's not uncommon
in a meteor shower.

176
00:09:39,096 --> 00:09:42,998
Yeah, no,
but it seemed different.

177
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,436
Gwen, what is it?

178
00:09:47,237 --> 00:09:49,304
Beth, would you mind
giving us a moment?

179
00:09:49,306 --> 00:09:51,108
Thanks.

180
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:53,942
Kurt, I'm telling you,
I'm concerned

181
00:09:53,944 --> 00:09:55,477
about this meteor
cloud's density.

182
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:57,946
If four objects aggregated
from the center,

183
00:09:57,948 --> 00:10:00,015
it could indicate
something much larger,

184
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:01,683
more dangerous that's
affecting them.

185
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,685
Gwen, I understand
you're being cautious

186
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,021
because of Russia but I ran
a complete threat matrix

187
00:10:06,023 --> 00:10:07,759
and everything looked fine.

188
00:10:10,094 --> 00:10:12,060
Yeah, but what
if we were wrong about

189
00:10:12,062 --> 00:10:14,229
Phaeton's disappearance
in that solar storm?

190
00:10:14,231 --> 00:10:16,231
After that asteroid's
last perihelion,

191
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:18,367
it never came back out
from behind the sun.

192
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:20,704
That was the biggest solar
shower in decades.

193
00:10:22,774 --> 00:10:24,106
Unless we just ca't see it.

194
00:10:24,108 --> 00:10:28,078
Can't see it.
Gwen, no.

195
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:41,592
Gwen, come on.
The crate's this way.

196
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:46,563
Beth?

197
00:10:58,308 --> 00:11:00,475
So, Gwen, Beth,
this is Brian

198
00:11:00,477 --> 00:11:03,447
and next to him is Meredith,
the unfortunate home owner.

199
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:08,851
Hey, Brian, Meredith, this
is our lead astrophysicist.

200
00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:10,352
Oh, my God!
Gwen Armstrong!

201
00:11:10,354 --> 00:11:12,721
I read all about you
in Wired Magazine.

202
00:11:12,723 --> 00:11:14,656
Looks like you have a fan.

203
00:11:14,658 --> 00:11:16,458
Oh, God, 'm so sorry
about what happened to those

204
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,627
poor people who got injured
in Chelyabinsk, Russia.

205
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:20,328
Thank you.

206
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:23,198
I've read every single
one of your books. Seriously.

207
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,633
When I saw it happen on
TV after your prediction,

208
00:11:24,635 --> 00:11:26,301
I felt so sad, you know?

209
00:11:26,303 --> 00:11:27,936
And it said that the U.S.
got the coordinates

210
00:11:27,938 --> 00:11:29,538
completely wrong.

211
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,773
And by the time they warned the
Russians, it was just too late.

212
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:32,474
Was that you?

213
00:11:32,476 --> 00:11:34,943
Were you the one who got the
coordinates completely wrong?

214
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:37,481
That was me.

215
00:11:41,351 --> 00:11:44,221
I'm sorry.
Sorry that it happened.

216
00:11:45,522 --> 00:11:46,823
Thank you.

217
00:11:46,825 --> 00:11:48,358
Thank you for your kind words.

218
00:11:50,227 --> 00:11:52,194
Hey, Brian, Meredith?

219
00:11:52,196 --> 00:11:54,129
Can I borrow you guys
for a second?

220
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,464
I want you to tell me all
about what you saw

221
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,532
when that meteor struck, yeah?

222
00:11:57,534 --> 00:11:59,334
Hey, Mara, why do't
you go radio base

223
00:11:59,336 --> 00:12:00,803
and tell them w'll be here
about another hour?

224
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:02,673
Copy that.

225
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:10,547
You okay?

226
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:13,381
Yeah.

227
00:12:13,383 --> 00:12:15,319
I just want to get this sample.

228
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:22,324
But if 'm being
completely honest...

229
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:24,896
this whole Russia thing
is still haunting me.

230
00:12:26,965 --> 00:12:28,430
Sorry.

231
00:12:28,432 --> 00:12:30,198
I don't mean to dump
all of this on you.

232
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,970
I know yo're here
just to learn.

233
00:12:34,738 --> 00:12:37,506
Uh... Dr. Armstrong?

234
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:38,707
Mm-hm?

235
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:40,342
I don't mean
to overstep my bounds.

236
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:41,777
But for what it's worth,

237
00:12:41,779 --> 00:12:45,080
your theories are taught
all over the world.

238
00:12:45,082 --> 00:12:47,182
Your husband, Michael,
just got promoted

239
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:50,185
for helping redesign
a nuclear launch system

240
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:52,087
and you get to work
with him every day.

241
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:55,590
If I even had a fraction
of those things,

242
00:12:55,592 --> 00:12:58,059
I'd think my life
was pretty incredible.

243
00:12:58,061 --> 00:13:02,597
Thank you, for all of that.

244
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:05,736
Okay, i's time to focus
on the task at hand, huh?

245
00:13:06,938 --> 00:13:09,538
All right.

246
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:14,543
So I need you to put these on.

247
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:18,480
I want you to monitor the meteor
cloud as I take the sample.

248
00:13:18,482 --> 00:13:21,383
I've never done this before.

249
00:13:21,385 --> 00:13:23,285
You said you want to work
in this industry, right?

250
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:24,820
Absolutely.

251
00:13:24,822 --> 00:13:26,321
Well, right now we need
to make sure that

252
00:13:26,323 --> 00:13:29,090
this meteor shower
isn't a meteor storm

253
00:13:29,092 --> 00:13:31,395
or something more dangerous.

254
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:35,265
Okay, put these on.

255
00:13:36,935 --> 00:13:38,002
I'll walk you through it.

256
00:13:39,503 --> 00:13:42,504
Okay, so the first setting
is just your basic telescope

257
00:13:42,506 --> 00:13:44,474
that you look
through the lens.

258
00:13:47,711 --> 00:13:50,412
The second rendering
closes the aperture

259
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:52,247
and gives you a
real VR rendering

260
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:55,283
from the Pentagon's database
in real time.

261
00:13:55,285 --> 00:13:57,487
Here you go.
Try that on.

262
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:02,591
Oh, wow!
This is incredible!

263
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:04,961
I's like 'm standing
above earth's orbit.

264
00:14:04,963 --> 00:14:06,996
Yeah. Pretty cool.

265
00:14:06,998 --> 00:14:08,764
And the third setting
just freezes the frame

266
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:10,599
and gives you
an interactive model.

267
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:12,902
But you don't need to worry
about that right now.

268
00:14:12,904 --> 00:14:14,904
What I need from you is
to tell me if you see

269
00:14:14,906 --> 00:14:17,372
meteor dust in the center
of that meteor cloud or

270
00:14:17,374 --> 00:14:20,508
if it's something solid
like an object.

271
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:24,346
Oh, it kind of just
looks like a blob,

272
00:14:24,348 --> 00:14:27,215
like it keeps shifting
and changing around.

273
00:14:27,217 --> 00:14:28,884
But I can't really focus on it.

274
00:14:28,886 --> 00:14:30,518
Okay.

275
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,387
Well, reach out your hand

276
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:35,457
and pull up the menu bar
on the right hand side.

277
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:38,126
Squeeze your wrist
and open it up, okay?

278
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:41,797
And what is the density in the
center of that meteor cloud?

279
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:45,003
Um, six objects
per square mile.

280
00:14:55,545 --> 00:14:56,444
Six?

281
00:14:56,446 --> 00:14:58,049
Yes, it says six.

282
00:15:01,786 --> 00:15:03,385
Do you remember
how to do a process?

283
00:15:03,387 --> 00:15:04,787
Yeah, I can do that.

284
00:15:04,789 --> 00:15:06,490
Okay, okay.

285
00:15:09,593 --> 00:15:12,130
Okay.
There you go.

286
00:15:17,701 --> 00:15:20,168
Hey, Gwen?
Wha's the ETA on that sample?

287
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,571
Uh, 30 seconds.

288
00:15:23,573 --> 00:15:25,440
Okay.

289
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:28,209
I don't understand why
he keeps rushing you.

290
00:15:28,211 --> 00:15:30,245
Maybe if he'd given
you more time on

291
00:15:30,247 --> 00:15:31,847
your spectral imaging
theory in Russia,

292
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:33,851
all of those people would't
have gotten hurt.

293
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:39,721
No. I had enough time.

294
00:15:39,723 --> 00:15:41,824
But your spectral
imaging theory revolutionized

295
00:15:41,826 --> 00:15:44,695
the way we do things
in the industry. I mean...

296
00:15:46,831 --> 00:15:48,530
Do you remember
that asteroid

297
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:51,366
that we found off
the observatory in Hawaii?

298
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:53,069
Yeah, it was 40,000 miles
off of earth.

299
00:15:53,071 --> 00:15:54,669
Mm-hm.

300
00:15:54,671 --> 00:15:57,807
Well, we found it
because of Kurt's algorithms.

301
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:00,178
H's the best
at projecting algorithms.

302
00:16:01,311 --> 00:16:03,012
Wha's that process say?

303
00:16:03,014 --> 00:16:04,980
59% iron and 31% silicates.

304
00:16:04,982 --> 00:16:07,716
Both iron and silicates
are fully crystallized.

305
00:16:07,718 --> 00:16:11,586
But if Dr. Siegel
ran his algorithm tests

306
00:16:11,588 --> 00:16:14,489
on something better,
something worthwhile

307
00:16:14,491 --> 00:16:16,826
like the Braeburg Effect?

308
00:16:16,828 --> 00:16:18,861
I don't think that
Anton Braeburg is someone

309
00:16:18,863 --> 00:16:21,362
that you should want to
model your career after.

310
00:16:21,364 --> 00:16:24,769
H's kind of a laughing stock of
the science community right now.

311
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:28,470
Okay.

312
00:16:28,472 --> 00:16:31,075
Hey, what's the core
temperature?

313
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,113
400 degrees.

314
00:16:37,115 --> 00:16:38,480
Are you sure?

315
00:16:38,482 --> 00:16:40,852
Yeah, it says 400.

316
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:50,258
Um, okay.

317
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,527
W've got to take
another sample.

318
00:16:52,529 --> 00:16:53,998
That ca't be right.

319
00:17:21,491 --> 00:17:23,591
Hey, Gwen, how we coming
on that sample?

320
00:17:23,593 --> 00:17:25,797
Uh, 30 seconds.

321
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,472
What is that, Gwen?

322
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:39,175
I's a composite drill,.

323
00:17:39,177 --> 00:17:40,542
I's a a combination of a
diamond and a laser.

324
00:17:40,544 --> 00:17:42,579
It can cut through anything.

325
00:17:58,296 --> 00:18:00,664
W've got to get this back
to base immediately.

326
00:18:07,205 --> 00:18:08,436
- You okay?
- Yeah.

327
00:18:08,438 --> 00:18:09,907
Hey, guys!

328
00:18:11,075 --> 00:18:13,142
A.M.S. site just
reported meteor made ground fall

329
00:18:13,144 --> 00:18:15,710
12 miles due south.
We gotta go. Come on.

330
00:18:15,712 --> 00:18:17,679
We have to get to base now!

331
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:19,181
This is much worse
than we thought.

332
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:20,952
I'll check in with NWS.

333
00:19:23,214 --> 00:19:24,914
No!

334
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:26,851
Oh, no!

335
00:19:28,786 --> 00:19:30,319
- You okay?
- I'm fine! I'm fine!

336
00:19:30,321 --> 00:19:33,421
Just get us out of here! Go!
Get us out of here.

337
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,259
Where's Gwen?
Where's Gwen?

338
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,630
Gwen!

339
00:19:44,835 --> 00:19:46,270
Gwen!

340
00:19:47,805 --> 00:19:49,106
Come on!

341
00:20:26,944 --> 00:20:28,712
Kurt!

342
00:20:37,788 --> 00:20:39,021
Where did you get this car?

343
00:20:39,023 --> 00:20:40,422
Owner got killed
by a meteorite.

344
00:20:40,424 --> 00:20:42,159
Go, go, go!

345
00:20:45,528 --> 00:20:48,032
No!
Oh, no.

346
00:20:48,698 --> 00:20:50,935
Beth is back there.

347
00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:08,083
No, Beth!
Beth is back there!

348
00:21:08,085 --> 00:21:09,485
- We gotta go back!
- Beth is gone, Gwen!

349
00:21:09,487 --> 00:21:11,086
Gwen, Beth is gone.
Leave her!

350
00:21:11,088 --> 00:21:12,490
Damn it.

351
00:21:17,228 --> 00:21:19,795
There's no signal.
There's no signal anywhere!

352
00:21:19,797 --> 00:21:21,163
Mara, what do you got?
What do you know?

353
00:21:21,165 --> 00:21:23,298
Last update I got
was one minute ago.

354
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,234
Meteor strike outside of Dublin.

355
00:21:25,236 --> 00:21:26,402
This thin's global.

356
00:21:26,404 --> 00:21:28,239
Oh, my God.

357
00:21:32,943 --> 00:21:34,709
Do you have anything?

358
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:36,313
No, the network's jammed.

359
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:41,152
You know what?
Let me try the satellite radio.

360
00:21:47,258 --> 00:21:48,791
Oh, my God!
Reverse! Reverse!

361
00:21:48,793 --> 00:21:50,394
- Go back!
- Go, go, go!

362
00:21:54,697 --> 00:21:56,934
Go!
Good, good, good.

363
00:21:58,668 --> 00:22:00,171
Mara!

364
00:22:10,548 --> 00:22:12,613
Okay, that was close.

365
00:22:12,615 --> 00:22:14,682
Everybody take a breath.
W're okay.

366
00:22:14,684 --> 00:22:16,087
We made it.

367
00:22:16,954 --> 00:22:19,290
- Okay. You okay?
- Yeah.

368
00:22:51,589 --> 00:22:53,755
Guys, if the ground fall
spans the entire hemisphere,

369
00:22:53,757 --> 00:22:58,293
there's no way the Pentagon got
off a full response, no way.

370
00:22:58,295 --> 00:22:59,862
You know, the're
definitely gonna add

371
00:22:59,864 --> 00:23:01,430
a Level Five nuke strike
for good measure.

372
00:23:01,432 --> 00:23:02,998
Probably.

373
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,299
Well, if they've
already launched Level Five,

374
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:05,868
then we're too late.

375
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,336
Because those meteors
will detonate those nukes

376
00:23:07,338 --> 00:23:09,037
long before i'll reach
the asteroid.

377
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,806
Then we'll have nothing
left to destroy it.

378
00:23:10,808 --> 00:23:12,908
What about NASA, JPL, GSS?

379
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:13,976
The've had to have
seen something!

380
00:23:13,978 --> 00:23:15,577
No one can see it.

381
00:23:15,579 --> 00:23:17,579
I's hidden inside
the meteor cloud. Remember?

382
00:23:17,581 --> 00:23:18,981
I's the needle in a haystack.

383
00:23:18,983 --> 00:23:20,382
- I know.
- Hey, we just need to get there

384
00:23:20,384 --> 00:23:22,484
and we need to tell them
to stop a Level Five.

385
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:24,853
Stop a Level Five?
The're not gonna react to us.

386
00:23:24,855 --> 00:23:27,156
The're gonna think we're giving
flawed data because of Russia!

387
00:23:27,158 --> 00:23:29,326
And if we need proof,
we do't have it.

388
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,600
So what are we gonna do?

389
00:23:38,602 --> 00:23:39,902
I don't know, Mara.

390
00:23:39,904 --> 00:23:41,470
This contradicts
my entire threat matrix.

391
00:23:41,472 --> 00:23:42,504
I'm at a loss.

392
00:23:42,506 --> 00:23:43,805
Gwen, help me out!

393
00:23:43,807 --> 00:23:45,440
Okay. First things
first, okay?

394
00:23:45,442 --> 00:23:47,509
We have to make sure that
they launch the EMOD, okay.

395
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:49,044
The evacuations, meteor shield,

396
00:23:49,046 --> 00:23:51,013
the ordinance and
the orbital drones, okay?

397
00:23:51,015 --> 00:23:52,114
And then, Kurt, you know what?

398
00:23:52,116 --> 00:23:53,649
I want you to take that this.

399
00:23:53,651 --> 00:23:55,450
Flag the center of the mass
in the meteor cloud.

400
00:23:55,452 --> 00:23:58,220
Mark it as an APB and
let all the departments know.

401
00:23:58,222 --> 00:23:59,687
At least that'll give
them a fighting chance

402
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:00,688
at least of IDing it.

403
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:01,790
I got it. Got it.

404
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,025
Okay? Good.

405
00:24:03,027 --> 00:24:04,461
Okay, keep driving.

406
00:24:25,015 --> 00:24:26,348
And Level Five?

407
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:28,317
As far as Level Five,
Kur's right.

408
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:30,252
The're not gonna delay
a threat response.

409
00:24:30,254 --> 00:24:32,221
And if we want them
to stop the launch then,

410
00:24:32,223 --> 00:24:34,489
the data needs
to come from somebody else,

411
00:24:34,491 --> 00:24:36,060
someone like Michael.

412
00:24:37,795 --> 00:24:39,328
H's now Lieutenant Colonel

413
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,530
and h's got
nuclear defense clearances.

414
00:24:41,532 --> 00:24:43,632
Yeah, but even if the order
comes down from him,

415
00:24:43,634 --> 00:24:46,868
he still has to get vetted
by Singh wh's at base.

416
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:48,604
Yeah, and Singh's not stupid.

417
00:24:48,606 --> 00:24:50,539
H's gonna know that order
is coming from you, Gwen.

418
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:52,307
Not if he breaks
the chain of command

419
00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:54,443
and goes straight
to the Pentagon, okay?

420
00:24:54,445 --> 00:24:57,479
There's no vetting, there's no
agencies, there's no red tape.

421
00:24:57,481 --> 00:25:00,148
Michael still blames
me for Russia, Gwen.

422
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,583
H's gonna think your
breaking protocol

423
00:25:01,585 --> 00:25:04,286
to save time for some
back intel I gave you.

424
00:25:04,288 --> 00:25:06,521
Look, we all know
whose fault Russia was.

425
00:25:06,523 --> 00:25:08,290
It wasn't yours.

426
00:25:08,292 --> 00:25:11,126
I love him, but today h's
just gonna have to get over it.

427
00:25:11,128 --> 00:25:15,030
Yeah, well, what if
Michael's unable to do it?

428
00:25:15,032 --> 00:25:16,832
Well, if he's unable to do
it, then you know what?

429
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:18,133
I'm going to take
the spec rendering

430
00:25:18,135 --> 00:25:19,968
straight to the Colonel,

431
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,236
straight to the
Command room right at base.

432
00:25:21,238 --> 00:25:22,371
Right.

433
00:25:22,373 --> 00:25:24,139
We have to stop
this launch, okay?

434
00:25:24,141 --> 00:25:25,874
So just get us to the base
and I'll get the proof.

435
00:25:25,876 --> 00:25:27,109
Yes, ma'am.

436
00:25:27,111 --> 00:25:29,113
W'll get you there.

437
00:25:47,131 --> 00:25:48,797
- Michael?
- Gwen?

438
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,666
There's a two-mile
wide asteroid hidden inside

439
00:25:50,668 --> 00:25:52,134
this meteor storm.

440
00:25:52,136 --> 00:25:53,669
W've got approximately
two hours and 29 minutes

441
00:25:53,671 --> 00:25:55,370
until it hits.

442
00:25:55,372 --> 00:25:57,439
Any nuclear response needs to
be saved to strike the asteroid.

443
00:25:57,441 --> 00:25:59,441
Gwen, you know
I can't do that.

444
00:25:59,443 --> 00:26:02,077
Colonel Singh has to approve
any protocol changes.

445
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:03,578
I mean, I can
flag incoming threats

446
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,080
on the defense database system.

447
00:26:05,082 --> 00:26:07,182
But I need a commanding
officer to clear it.

448
00:26:07,184 --> 00:26:11,386
But none of the other agencies
can see the asteroid!

449
00:26:11,388 --> 00:26:13,555
Michael, this is the worst
case scenario.

450
00:26:13,557 --> 00:26:15,590
The only reason I know
i's there is because

451
00:26:15,592 --> 00:26:18,262
I was able to examine
this mornin's meteorite.

452
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,066
What is that?

453
00:26:24,068 --> 00:26:26,001
Meteor debris.

454
00:26:26,003 --> 00:26:27,536
Shouldn't be that big.

455
00:26:27,538 --> 00:26:29,471
It is.

456
00:26:29,473 --> 00:26:32,007
Oh, my gosh!
I's creating a dust cloud.

457
00:26:32,009 --> 00:26:34,209
Keep going!
Keep driving!

458
00:26:34,211 --> 00:26:37,479
No, no, no, no, no!

459
00:26:37,481 --> 00:26:39,717
- Damn it!
- Oh, no.

460
00:26:42,653 --> 00:26:44,419
Oh, no.

461
00:26:44,421 --> 00:26:46,188
Are you okay?
Wha's going on?

462
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,589
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

463
00:26:47,591 --> 00:26:49,124
I's just that our
vehicle stalled.

464
00:26:49,126 --> 00:26:51,326
Meteor debris
choked out the engine.

465
00:26:51,328 --> 00:26:53,295
Oh, no.

466
00:26:53,297 --> 00:26:54,229
Damn it!

467
00:26:54,231 --> 00:26:56,801
Well, let's go fix it.

468
00:27:11,648 --> 00:27:13,415
Okay...

469
00:27:13,417 --> 00:27:14,282
Okay, okay.

470
00:27:14,284 --> 00:27:16,220
What do you think it is?

471
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,456
I's the belt chain.

472
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:22,726
Belt chain.

473
00:27:24,995 --> 00:27:26,495
Okay.

474
00:27:26,497 --> 00:27:28,663
Gwen, you gotta get
out of there right now.

475
00:27:28,665 --> 00:27:30,232
This meteor storm is escalating!

476
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:32,033
The DOD has already approved
a Level Five launch

477
00:27:32,035 --> 00:27:34,603
and there's gonna be a meteor
shower right in your area.

478
00:27:34,605 --> 00:27:35,704
Get out!

479
00:27:35,706 --> 00:27:37,406
Michael, listen to me.

480
00:27:37,408 --> 00:27:40,075
I can't stop this nuke strike,
but you can.

481
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:41,410
Defense protocols
are cleared

482
00:27:41,412 --> 00:27:43,011
for rank Lieutenant Colonel
and above.

483
00:27:43,013 --> 00:27:45,247
Okay, call General Ambrose
at the Pentagon

484
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:46,783
and tell him it was
you who personally

485
00:27:46,785 --> 00:27:48,550
identified this
as an asteroid.

486
00:27:48,552 --> 00:27:51,153
We have to save the nukes
for the asteroid!

487
00:27:51,155 --> 00:27:53,155
I'm not gonna lie
to a commanding officer!

488
00:27:53,157 --> 00:27:55,190
It is't a lie.

489
00:27:55,192 --> 00:27:56,558
I's a mass inside a cloud

490
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,795
that you or anyone
can see easily on radar.

491
00:27:58,797 --> 00:28:01,430
It just has't been
IDed as an asteroid yet.

492
00:28:01,432 --> 00:28:02,931
The observatories
can't tell what it is

493
00:28:02,933 --> 00:28:05,202
and the DOD isn't
listening to me.

494
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:08,336
Is this from some intel
that Mara gave you?

495
00:28:08,338 --> 00:28:12,209
No, Michael.
You can confirm it personally.

496
00:28:13,577 --> 00:28:15,177
I's as if you've captured
the dimensions

497
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:17,078
through
spectral imaging, okay?

498
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,449
You're asking me to stop a
nuclear strike in mid-launch?

499
00:28:20,451 --> 00:28:21,918
W're gonna leave
the whole planet

500
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,385
vulnerable to
a meteor storm.

501
00:28:23,387 --> 00:28:25,053
If you launch that strike,

502
00:28:25,055 --> 00:28:26,388
this storm will detonate
every one of those nukes

503
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,056
before it reaches the asteroid.

504
00:28:28,058 --> 00:28:30,525
Only use conventional weapons
on the meteors.

505
00:28:30,527 --> 00:28:32,929
The drones have plasma
cannons that can melt tanks.

506
00:28:32,931 --> 00:28:35,865
And the satellite missiles?
Well, the're bunker busters.

507
00:28:35,867 --> 00:28:39,534
And the meteor shield
is woven crystallized carbon.

508
00:28:39,536 --> 00:28:41,369
And if the nukes strike
in the upper atmosphere,

509
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:43,505
w're talking fallout
on a global scale.

510
00:28:43,507 --> 00:28:45,140
At its current heading,
the nukes will strike it

511
00:28:45,142 --> 00:28:46,876
right outside the mesosphere.

512
00:28:46,878 --> 00:28:49,744
Fallout will be high enough just
like any other nuclear test.

513
00:28:49,746 --> 00:28:52,347
Gwen...

514
00:28:52,349 --> 00:28:55,319
I could go to prison
for the rest of my life.

515
00:28:56,821 --> 00:28:58,386
We both could.

516
00:28:58,388 --> 00:29:00,355
There's no time!
Break the chain of command!

517
00:29:00,357 --> 00:29:02,724
Okay?
You have to stop this launch!

518
00:29:02,726 --> 00:29:04,762
Michael, you have to believe me!

519
00:29:07,698 --> 00:29:09,164
Wha's our mark?

520
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:12,033
Two hours, 16 minutes,
south-southwest.

521
00:29:12,035 --> 00:29:13,670
I love you.

522
00:29:14,705 --> 00:29:15,840
I love you.

523
00:29:22,145 --> 00:29:24,782
So yo're a mechanic.
Tha's nice.

524
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:43,732
I got it.

525
00:29:43,734 --> 00:29:45,235
You got it.

526
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:49,839
Right.

527
00:29:49,841 --> 00:29:51,375
Yeah, come on.

528
00:30:09,293 --> 00:30:12,427
This just in: the
Geological Society of America

529
00:30:12,429 --> 00:30:15,230
is now weighing in on
the growing threat of what

530
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:19,167
is now being called a
"Meteor Storm".

531
00:30:19,169 --> 00:30:21,603
Reported gravitational anomalies
and impact zones

532
00:30:21,605 --> 00:30:24,040
are stirring up
geologic activity,

533
00:30:24,042 --> 00:30:28,577
including hot zones of volcanic
activity in our national parks.

534
00:30:28,579 --> 00:30:32,714
Carbon dioxide, monoxide and
methane levels in the atmosphere

535
00:30:32,716 --> 00:30:35,550
are spiking nationwide.

536
00:30:35,552 --> 00:30:38,353
This is beginning to impact
the wildlife in the area,

537
00:30:38,355 --> 00:30:40,355
with reported injuries
and deaths being seen

538
00:30:40,357 --> 00:30:42,624
as far north as Canada.

539
00:30:42,626 --> 00:30:45,861
The Department of Defense
is involved as well as the U.N.

540
00:30:45,863 --> 00:30:48,998
and NATO in preparation for
a potential nuclear strike

541
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,498
on the meteor storm.

542
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,367
Standby by for
further instructions

543
00:30:52,369 --> 00:30:54,636
from the Emergency
Broadcast System

544
00:30:54,638 --> 00:30:57,875
and in the meantime,
please remain indoors.

545
00:30:58,977 --> 00:31:00,442
Wyoming!

546
00:31:00,444 --> 00:31:03,278
I just received a terminate
signal from you!

547
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,682
Hang on!
I'm putting you on com!

548
00:31:07,618 --> 00:31:10,452
There had better be a
good reason for this!

549
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:13,321
Sir, this is Lieutenant
Colonel Michael Armstrong, sir.

550
00:31:13,323 --> 00:31:14,857
Under Colonel Singh in Wyoming.

551
00:31:14,859 --> 00:31:17,492
I have full confirmation
of an incoming NEO

552
00:31:17,494 --> 00:31:19,628
backed by radar GSS.

553
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:22,364
Incoming coordinates outlined
by radar are as follows:

554
00:31:22,366 --> 00:31:25,667
tha's ID number 3200 Phaeton,

555
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:27,669
vector southwest, sir.

556
00:31:27,671 --> 00:31:29,772
Sir, we need to stop Level Five
countdown immediately

557
00:31:29,774 --> 00:31:32,207
and retain as a defense
against the asteroid.

558
00:31:34,979 --> 00:31:36,711
We did not copy, Lieutenant!

559
00:31:36,713 --> 00:31:38,647
Repeat, we did not copy!

560
00:31:38,649 --> 00:31:41,383
I repeat!
We have an incoming NEO!

561
00:31:41,385 --> 00:31:43,485
It will strike in T-minus

562
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:45,021
two hours, 16 minutes, sir!

563
00:31:45,023 --> 00:31:47,322
We are aware of the
meteor storm, Lieutenant.

564
00:31:47,324 --> 00:31:50,325
However, your alarm regards
a global response.

565
00:31:50,327 --> 00:31:53,628
Is this signed off
by Colonel Singh?

566
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,131
Colonel Singh is
responding directly

567
00:31:55,133 --> 00:31:56,665
to a situation
in the field, sir.

568
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:58,667
But I have direct orders
from the colonel

569
00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:00,468
to terminate Level Five, sir.

570
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:04,272
Lieutenant, we have
all EMODs active!

571
00:32:04,274 --> 00:32:05,941
Terminate Level Five, sir.

572
00:32:05,943 --> 00:32:08,878
We are confirmed on
the meteor threat, Lieutenant!

573
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,579
I re...
abort le... Five, sir!

574
00:32:11,581 --> 00:32:13,983
Level Five, abort!
Do you copy, General?

575
00:32:13,985 --> 00:32:15,519
We are initiat...

576
00:32:33,805 --> 00:32:36,839
Nice of you to join us,
Lieutenant Armstrong.

577
00:32:36,841 --> 00:32:38,573
Apologies, sir.
It wo't happen again.

578
00:32:38,575 --> 00:32:40,742
Daniels, what's the status
on the meteor shower?

579
00:32:40,744 --> 00:32:46,849
Incoming,
Vector 20, Delta 909, Kentucky.

580
00:32:46,851 --> 00:32:47,950
Incoming.

581
00:32:47,952 --> 00:32:52,387
Vector 919, Epsilon 30,
South Dakota.

582
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:54,556
Washington confirms
drones are in place,

583
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:57,392
meteor shield deployed,
orbital missiles engaged.

584
00:32:57,394 --> 00:33:01,931
Level Five Strike at
T minus three minutes.

585
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:04,967
We have a terminate
switch active

586
00:33:04,969 --> 00:33:08,638
on our global response, sir.
Is this accurate?

587
00:33:13,077 --> 00:33:16,011
This phon's dead.
Get me Ambrose on the line.

588
00:33:16,013 --> 00:33:17,614
Yes, sir.

589
00:33:21,953 --> 00:33:24,654
This is gonna be a long
day, Daniels.

590
00:33:30,828 --> 00:33:33,361
Armstrong, what's the status
on that phone?

591
00:33:33,363 --> 00:33:34,729
IT is working on it, sir.

592
00:33:34,731 --> 00:33:36,801
We should be back up
in a few minutes.

593
00:33:38,702 --> 00:33:40,568
We are still on track
for launch.

594
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:44,106
Nuclear response in T minus
2 minutes 30 seconds.

595
00:33:44,108 --> 00:33:46,374
Even if we ca't get in touch
with the Pentagon,

596
00:33:46,376 --> 00:33:47,943
we are following our last
known orders.

597
00:33:47,945 --> 00:33:50,982
Daniels, check the targeting
array is still aligned.

598
00:34:12,236 --> 00:34:13,535
Sir, we have a
full system crash

599
00:34:13,537 --> 00:34:15,670
in the western half of the U.S.!

600
00:34:15,672 --> 00:34:18,174
Colonel, we just severed
our apparatus to the Pentagon.

601
00:34:18,176 --> 00:34:21,576
Our missile systems for the
whole region are failing.

602
00:34:21,578 --> 00:34:23,578
Sir, what did you do?

603
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,446
Lieutenant Armstrong,

604
00:34:25,448 --> 00:34:27,649
step away from the com
and disarm now!

605
00:34:27,651 --> 00:34:29,417
Private Daniels, get DOD
back online

606
00:34:29,419 --> 00:34:31,319
to initiate that
launch right now.

607
00:34:31,321 --> 00:34:32,687
Sir, all of our coms are down.

608
00:34:32,689 --> 00:34:34,890
Our landline and
backup feed are down.

609
00:34:34,892 --> 00:34:37,760
Lieutenant Colonel Armstrong
crashed the system, sir.

610
00:34:37,762 --> 00:34:40,229
Subdue him now!
Get the system back online!

611
00:34:40,231 --> 00:34:42,697
Daniels, get me communication
with the Pentagon now.

612
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:44,099
I's our new
guidance system, sir!

613
00:34:44,101 --> 00:34:45,901
Armstrong cut off
half the country,

614
00:34:45,903 --> 00:34:47,937
and a meteor just struck our
bas's satellite dish, sir.

615
00:34:47,939 --> 00:34:50,371
Okay. Repair the dish and
run an auxiliary patch

616
00:34:50,373 --> 00:34:51,941
straight to our ground lines.

617
00:34:51,943 --> 00:34:53,876
You may have just killed
millions of people.

618
00:34:53,878 --> 00:34:56,245
Stick him in Holding
or 'll kill him myself.

619
00:34:56,247 --> 00:34:59,681
Colonel! I had no choice but
to cancel the Level Five!

620
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:01,784
You just severed our
defenses to a global threat!

621
00:35:01,786 --> 00:35:05,287
I confirm when to call off a
nuclear strike!

622
00:35:05,289 --> 00:35:07,058
I will skin him alive for this!

623
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:21,070
Sir, EMOD live
and engaging targets.

624
00:35:21,072 --> 00:35:23,471
All nuclear
capable countries have confirmed

625
00:35:23,473 --> 00:35:25,241
participation Level Five.

626
00:35:25,243 --> 00:35:26,978
Give me a Level Five mark.

627
00:35:38,823 --> 00:35:40,823
We are live.
Targe's engaged.

628
00:35:40,825 --> 00:35:43,424
Okay.
Give me a real time kill ratio.

629
00:35:43,426 --> 00:35:45,094
Keep me appraised Level Five.

630
00:35:45,096 --> 00:35:49,798
Standing by for kill ratio
and Level Five standing by.

631
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,400
Have we restored communication
with the Pentagon?

632
00:35:52,402 --> 00:35:55,804
ETA, 30 seconds, sir.

633
00:35:55,806 --> 00:36:00,744
EMOD kill ration at 6%
and climbing. 7%. 8%.

634
00:36:06,918 --> 00:36:09,287
Gwen, check with VR,
see wha's happening.

635
00:36:19,931 --> 00:36:22,097
Did the meteor shield deploy?

636
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:23,332
Mm-hmm.

637
00:36:23,334 --> 00:36:25,803
Looks like we still have
incoming meteors!

638
00:36:28,205 --> 00:36:32,174
Level Five launch
in T minus 30, 29,

639
00:36:32,176 --> 00:36:35,311
28, 27,

640
00:36:35,313 --> 00:36:37,281
26, 25...

641
00:36:43,821 --> 00:36:46,021
Gwen?

642
00:36:46,023 --> 00:36:47,790
The meteors are still
coming through.

643
00:36:47,792 --> 00:36:49,659
Wha's going on
out there?

644
00:36:51,796 --> 00:36:53,429
All batteries are deployed.

645
00:36:53,431 --> 00:36:55,866
Defense systems are firing
but tha's not enough.

646
00:37:11,681 --> 00:37:13,683
Oh, shoot.

647
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:19,121
18, 17, 16...

648
00:37:19,123 --> 00:37:22,858
15, 14, 13, 12...

649
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:23,993
Phalanx one through four down!

650
00:37:23,995 --> 00:37:25,828
Phalanx eight through 12 down!

651
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:27,595
Launch orthogonal 90 degrees!

652
00:37:27,597 --> 00:37:29,298
Sir, nuclear assets
in the entire

653
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,066
western hemisphere are offline.

654
00:37:31,068 --> 00:37:32,868
It seems like
the've been crashed

655
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,336
from a program out of Wyoming.

656
00:37:34,338 --> 00:37:35,804
Do we have backup?

657
00:37:35,806 --> 00:37:37,842
Launch backup as soon
as it's live!

658
00:37:44,714 --> 00:37:46,982
Gwen, wha's
the status on that response?

659
00:37:46,984 --> 00:37:49,184
Only 12% of the meteors
have been destroyed.

660
00:37:49,186 --> 00:37:50,119
Twelve percent.

661
00:37:50,121 --> 00:37:52,054
Still no sign of
the nukes.

662
00:37:59,696 --> 00:38:02,331
East Coast backup system
is restored!

663
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:04,800
T minus 0 and launch.

664
00:38:04,802 --> 00:38:06,470
East Coast is go.

665
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:13,244
Russia is go!

666
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:22,319
India is go!

667
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:31,796
U.S. arsenal, 50%.

668
00:38:49,413 --> 00:38:50,345
No!

669
00:38:50,347 --> 00:38:51,679
No, no, no, no!

670
00:38:51,681 --> 00:38:53,282
What? What? What?
What is it?

671
00:38:53,284 --> 00:38:54,783
The nukes.

672
00:38:54,785 --> 00:38:56,919
The've detonated the nukes!

673
00:38:56,921 --> 00:38:58,653
I have VR confirmation
that they've launched

674
00:38:58,655 --> 00:39:02,359
from the East Coast along with
all the other nuclear countries!

675
00:39:03,127 --> 00:39:05,262
This is Dr. Armstrong.
Come in.

676
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,666
Wha's our percentage of
airborne nuclear missiles?

677
00:39:11,668 --> 00:39:13,235
50%.

678
00:39:13,237 --> 00:39:14,870
All other countries have
launched their full arsenal.

679
00:39:14,872 --> 00:39:16,505
Orbital weapons?

680
00:39:16,507 --> 00:39:18,507
All ordinance and drones
are completely destroyed.

681
00:39:18,509 --> 00:39:21,577
W've also lost four out of 20
of our communication satellites.

682
00:39:21,579 --> 00:39:24,113
The only thing we have left
is the shield, sir.

683
00:39:27,051 --> 00:39:28,450
Yeah?

684
00:39:28,452 --> 00:39:30,185
Michael, why did you let
them launch the nukes?

685
00:39:30,187 --> 00:39:32,720
Dr. Armstrong, your husband
has been arrested

686
00:39:32,722 --> 00:39:34,423
for a breach of
national security.

687
00:39:34,425 --> 00:39:36,492
His attempt to take down
the nuclear guidance system

688
00:39:36,494 --> 00:39:39,361
was stopped but we were only
able to fire half our payload.

689
00:39:39,363 --> 00:39:41,163
Colonel, sir?

690
00:39:41,165 --> 00:39:42,865
I assure you that Michael was
just forwarding the message...

691
00:39:42,867 --> 00:39:45,033
If yo're involved in
any way in any of this,

692
00:39:45,035 --> 00:39:47,002
you will never see
light of day again.

693
00:39:47,004 --> 00:39:49,505
Now return to base immediately
and report to me in Command.

694
00:39:56,347 --> 00:39:58,847
Michael's been arrested
and Singh wants me to report

695
00:39:58,849 --> 00:40:00,082
to the Command Center
as soon as we arrive.

696
00:40:00,084 --> 00:40:01,649
But you can't report to Singh!

697
00:40:01,651 --> 00:40:03,252
If he has you arrested,
you're done!

698
00:40:03,254 --> 00:40:04,453
W're all done!

699
00:40:04,455 --> 00:40:05,854
Mar's absolutely right.

700
00:40:05,856 --> 00:40:07,623
I can run predictive
algorithms all day long.

701
00:40:07,625 --> 00:40:10,325
But spectral imaging, that is
your area of expertise, Gwen.

702
00:40:10,327 --> 00:40:13,862
By the time I compile the data,
it would be too late.

703
00:40:13,864 --> 00:40:15,397
Her's what we're gonna do.

704
00:40:15,399 --> 00:40:16,899
As soon as we arrive
at the security checkpoint,

705
00:40:16,901 --> 00:40:18,600
I want you to report
your injuries.

706
00:40:18,602 --> 00:40:20,068
Under Code Blue, they cannot
arrest any injured personnel.

707
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,436
Right.

708
00:40:21,438 --> 00:40:22,703
The'll definitely have
MPs looking for you

709
00:40:22,705 --> 00:40:24,373
all over the medical bay.

710
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:26,475
I imagine they will, but 'll
find my way to the lab, okay?

711
00:40:26,477 --> 00:40:28,277
I'll get the proof and 'll
meet Singh in Command Center.

712
00:40:28,279 --> 00:40:29,580
Got it.

713
00:40:32,249 --> 00:40:33,517
Defense alarm.

714
00:40:35,419 --> 00:40:36,852
Hey, what have we got?

715
00:40:36,854 --> 00:40:39,890
No!
No, no, no.

716
00:40:48,766 --> 00:40:50,265
The strike is complete, sir.

717
00:40:50,267 --> 00:40:51,934
All nuclear weapons
from all countries

718
00:40:51,936 --> 00:40:53,769
have detonated in orbit, sir.

719
00:40:53,771 --> 00:40:56,872
Wha's our kill percentage?

720
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:58,106
25%, sir.

721
00:40:58,108 --> 00:40:59,740
What?
Tha's not possible!

722
00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:08,150
Meteor shield taking
heavy fire, sir!

723
00:41:08,152 --> 00:41:10,221
Sir, the entire shiel's
coming apart!

724
00:41:10,955 --> 00:41:12,423
Son of a bitch.

725
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:24,032
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

726
00:41:24,034 --> 00:41:27,536
Let's go. Where is everybody?
Why are there no guards?

727
00:41:27,538 --> 00:41:29,171
I's protocol to secure
all personnel

728
00:41:29,173 --> 00:41:30,672
inside the facility
during a launch.

729
00:41:30,674 --> 00:41:33,310
Looks like the cameras
are down. Thanks, Michael.

730
00:41:34,945 --> 00:41:36,678
Code Blue!
Where's the OR?

731
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,146
OR? Why?
What happened?

732
00:41:38,148 --> 00:41:39,448
Please!
I've lost a lot of blood!

733
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:40,949
- How? What happened?
- I was hit by a meteor!

734
00:41:40,951 --> 00:41:42,317
Come on!
We do't have time!

735
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,353
- Where do you need to go?
- OR!

736
00:41:44,355 --> 00:41:45,990
Come on.

737
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:48,257
Code orange is now in effect.

738
00:41:48,259 --> 00:41:49,992
All medical personnel report

739
00:41:49,994 --> 00:41:52,696
to your designated
emergency response locations.

740
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,964
I'm all right,
I'm all right.

741
00:41:55,966 --> 00:41:59,034
Oh, God, I should wrap this up.

742
00:41:59,036 --> 00:42:01,272
Yeah, I'm okay.

743
00:42:03,007 --> 00:42:04,339
Don't worry about me.

744
00:42:04,341 --> 00:42:07,044
- Give us a minute, please!
- Thank you.

745
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:10,879
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Just get the gauze.

746
00:42:10,881 --> 00:42:13,217
Wrap me up.
We gotta go.

747
00:42:17,554 --> 00:42:19,523
Just grab anything.

748
00:42:23,027 --> 00:42:24,393
Wha's wrong with you?

749
00:42:24,395 --> 00:42:26,328
- I'm fine.
- Mara, what happened?

750
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:28,130
I'm fine.

751
00:42:28,132 --> 00:42:30,132
All right, come here.
You have to help me.

752
00:42:30,134 --> 00:42:32,202
- Hold on.
- All right.

753
00:42:38,842 --> 00:42:40,678
Are you sure yo're all right?

754
00:42:47,786 --> 00:42:49,486
Okay. Sit down.

755
00:42:51,522 --> 00:42:52,921
I'm sorry.

756
00:42:52,923 --> 00:42:54,890
I's all right.
Just a quick wrap.

757
00:42:54,892 --> 00:42:57,394
- We gotta go.
- I know.

758
00:43:02,266 --> 00:43:03,667
Mara, you sure
you're all right?

759
00:43:05,602 --> 00:43:07,436
I'm fine.

760
00:43:07,438 --> 00:43:10,207
Hey, thank you.

761
00:43:10,809 --> 00:43:12,274
Yeah.

762
00:43:12,276 --> 00:43:14,578
We have to go talk
to Colonel Singh.

763
00:43:18,649 --> 00:43:21,049
Are you okay?

764
00:43:21,051 --> 00:43:23,620
Yeah.
Let's go see Singh.

765
00:43:42,306 --> 00:43:45,642
Okay, all right.
Let's get you going.

766
00:43:47,544 --> 00:43:50,145
Pop up.

767
00:43:50,147 --> 00:43:52,116
Where's the screen here?

768
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:54,516
There.

769
00:43:54,518 --> 00:43:56,218
All right, so...

770
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:59,323
Tha's good.
And these coordinates.

771
00:44:00,491 --> 00:44:02,393
47...

772
00:44:05,429 --> 00:44:06,765
Nine...

773
00:44:10,601 --> 00:44:12,667
Okay.

774
00:44:12,669 --> 00:44:15,270
This database.

775
00:44:15,272 --> 00:44:18,275
Around the meteor cloud,
the density.

776
00:44:19,276 --> 00:44:20,744
600...

777
00:44:24,715 --> 00:44:26,250
Let's find you.

778
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,627
Officer Pritchard.
Dr. Siegel.

779
00:44:38,629 --> 00:44:39,995
Colonel Singh, sir.

780
00:44:39,997 --> 00:44:42,364
As soon as the storm passes,

781
00:44:42,366 --> 00:44:45,802
we will be disbanding
your department.

782
00:44:45,804 --> 00:44:47,169
The incoming is so heavy,

783
00:44:47,171 --> 00:44:48,537
we can barely get damage
report from the field.

784
00:44:48,539 --> 00:44:50,238
Colonel, sir!

785
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,706
Dr. Armstrong thought
the threat was big enough.

786
00:44:51,708 --> 00:44:53,275
She doesn't give orders!
I give orders!

787
00:44:53,277 --> 00:44:54,676
Where is Gwen Armstrong?

788
00:44:54,678 --> 00:44:57,012
Sir, she left us as soon
as we arrived.

789
00:44:57,014 --> 00:44:58,547
Well, she needs to be here
at this com

790
00:44:58,549 --> 00:45:00,449
to be questioned
by me personally!

791
00:45:00,451 --> 00:45:02,384
People are dead
and dying, Dr. Siegel!

792
00:45:02,386 --> 00:45:04,986
- Sir.
- Officer Pritchard?

793
00:45:04,988 --> 00:45:07,222
Sir, 've been working
the field with Dr. Armstrong

794
00:45:07,224 --> 00:45:08,891
for over seven years now

795
00:45:08,893 --> 00:45:10,860
and her input concerning
this storm

796
00:45:10,862 --> 00:45:13,361
is critical to our survival.

797
00:45:13,363 --> 00:45:14,696
Mm-hm.

798
00:45:14,698 --> 00:45:16,398
I'm aware of your work
with Dr. Armstrong.

799
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,300
Her husband has't
been shy about reporting

800
00:45:18,302 --> 00:45:20,471
your failures in Russia.

801
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,511
Here...

802
00:45:28,847 --> 00:45:30,547
There.

803
00:45:37,554 --> 00:45:38,957
There you are.

804
00:45:40,057 --> 00:45:41,592
There you are.

805
00:45:42,493 --> 00:45:46,461
Yep. I knew it!

806
00:45:46,463 --> 00:45:48,665
Okay, okay.

807
00:45:49,868 --> 00:45:51,201
Yep.

808
00:46:04,114 --> 00:46:05,781
You know what?

809
00:46:05,783 --> 00:46:08,383
Gwen Armstrong has been flagged
as a national security risk.

810
00:46:08,385 --> 00:46:10,418
And I cannot have her
wandering this base.

811
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:11,921
Colonel, sir, you must
let her complete her testing

812
00:46:11,923 --> 00:46:14,523
- before you speak...
- Dr. Siegel, I respect you

813
00:46:14,525 --> 00:46:15,892
and I'm trying
to respect your team.

814
00:46:15,894 --> 00:46:17,359
But after the Russia incident

815
00:46:17,361 --> 00:46:18,928
and today's failed
orbit defense,

816
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:21,596
you are no longer cleared
to advise this base.

817
00:46:21,598 --> 00:46:23,265
Are you with me?

818
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,371
Where's the power reserve?

819
00:46:29,373 --> 00:46:31,540
The last impact carried
an electromagnet pulse!

820
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:33,708
The reserve power's
offline, sir.

821
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:35,510
Engineering's en route
right now to repair it.

822
00:46:35,512 --> 00:46:37,045
And the communications?

823
00:46:37,047 --> 00:46:38,446
Engineering's running
a dedicated line

824
00:46:38,448 --> 00:46:40,415
to both the dish
and the Command Center

825
00:46:40,417 --> 00:46:42,250
that goes all the way to D.C.

826
00:46:42,252 --> 00:46:44,052
Engineering's doing
their best right now.

827
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:45,420
Sir, please.

828
00:46:45,422 --> 00:46:47,023
Detaining Gwen
is a grave mistake.

829
00:46:47,025 --> 00:46:48,824
No one is more steeped in
this research than she is.

830
00:46:48,826 --> 00:46:50,960
We are dealing with
global threats right now,

831
00:46:50,962 --> 00:46:52,727
not on Gwen Armstrong's latest
free-association.

832
00:46:52,729 --> 00:46:57,632
- You're team is relieved.
- I's an asteroid!

833
00:46:57,634 --> 00:47:00,569
I have proof,
undeniable proof.

834
00:47:00,571 --> 00:47:02,304
I just needed to wait
for the information

835
00:47:02,306 --> 00:47:03,806
to come in to create
a spectral image.

836
00:47:03,808 --> 00:47:05,574
There over 100 observatories.

837
00:47:05,576 --> 00:47:06,976
The observatories
can't see it.

838
00:47:06,978 --> 00:47:08,610
And it wo't show up on radar

839
00:47:08,612 --> 00:47:10,078
until it emerges out of
meteor cloud that's covering.

840
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,513
And then it's gonna hit earth.

841
00:47:11,515 --> 00:47:13,448
I don't see how
a rainbow reflected back

842
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:16,353
from a meteor cloud can create
an image like this, doctor.

843
00:47:19,323 --> 00:47:21,690
We kept picking up
a dense section on our radar.

844
00:47:21,692 --> 00:47:23,993
It failed to yield
anything definitive,

845
00:47:23,995 --> 00:47:27,195
but I knew that something
was acting on these meteors,

846
00:47:27,197 --> 00:47:28,764
slowing them down.

847
00:47:28,766 --> 00:47:32,302
So I took a sustained
spectrometer reading and...

848
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:37,608
There it is.

849
00:47:46,283 --> 00:47:47,616
So yo're telling us
this asteroid

850
00:47:47,618 --> 00:47:50,352
is cloaked
by its own meteor shower?

851
00:47:50,354 --> 00:47:52,120
This is the sun, okay?

852
00:47:52,122 --> 00:47:56,291
During it's last perihelion,
Phaeton was knocked off course,

853
00:47:56,293 --> 00:47:59,396
causing it to go back
into the meteor trail.

854
00:48:00,631 --> 00:48:02,197
When it finally caught
up with the meteors,

855
00:48:02,199 --> 00:48:04,100
it exerted its own
gravitational force,

856
00:48:04,102 --> 00:48:06,869
causing the meteors to slow down
and making them safe

857
00:48:06,871 --> 00:48:09,537
to actually enter into
our own atmosphere,

858
00:48:09,539 --> 00:48:11,876
which is what's causing
the meteor storm outside.

859
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:16,411
So even if we were to
destroy all of the meteors,

860
00:48:16,413 --> 00:48:19,180
we still have a 2.6-mile
asteroid to destroy.

861
00:48:19,182 --> 00:48:20,983
Where will it strike?

862
00:48:20,985 --> 00:48:24,319
Difficult to say,
which is why Dr. Siegel

863
00:48:24,321 --> 00:48:26,655
has run a sequencing
algorithm. Kurt?

864
00:48:26,657 --> 00:48:29,257
Its trajectory places
it on the northernmost tip

865
00:48:29,259 --> 00:48:32,895
of Manitoba, 1,538 miles
west of the bay.

866
00:48:32,897 --> 00:48:34,964
Fortunately, I was able
to upload its vector

867
00:48:34,966 --> 00:48:37,265
to a priority list before
the last power outage.

868
00:48:37,267 --> 00:48:39,200
I's far from
a populated area.

869
00:48:39,202 --> 00:48:40,836
That does't matter, sir.

870
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:44,339
The force will be equivalent
to one million Hiroshimas.

871
00:48:44,341 --> 00:48:47,642
So that's why you fought
so hard to stop Level Five?

872
00:48:47,644 --> 00:48:49,011
Exactly.

873
00:48:49,013 --> 00:48:51,013
Now with what we have,
we need a surgical response.

874
00:48:51,015 --> 00:48:53,149
- Surgical?
- Mara?

875
00:48:53,151 --> 00:48:55,084
We have about
2,000 warheads left.

876
00:48:55,086 --> 00:48:57,686
At 50 megatons each,
tha's 100,000 megatons,

877
00:48:57,688 --> 00:49:00,956
- 50,000 per stage of attack.
- Good.

878
00:49:00,958 --> 00:49:02,758
So it has't reached
a million megatons yet.

879
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,225
We need to use half
of our remaining nukes

880
00:49:04,227 --> 00:49:06,461
to dissipate the meteor cloud,

881
00:49:06,463 --> 00:49:08,396
then shoot the other
half straight

882
00:49:08,398 --> 00:49:09,967
at the asteroid to destroy it.

883
00:49:16,074 --> 00:49:19,443
Sir, we're back online.
All systems are active.

884
00:49:21,946 --> 00:49:24,713
Daniels, you need to get
Joe Ambrose on the phone.

885
00:49:24,715 --> 00:49:27,449
And, you, go get your husband.

886
00:49:27,451 --> 00:49:28,886
Copy that.

887
00:50:24,909 --> 00:50:25,908
Michael?

888
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:27,342
Oh my God.

889
00:50:27,344 --> 00:50:29,277
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, God.

890
00:50:29,279 --> 00:50:30,712
I was so scared.

891
00:50:30,714 --> 00:50:32,649
I was so afraid
you got hurt out there.

892
00:50:34,651 --> 00:50:36,451
Is there any update?

893
00:50:36,453 --> 00:50:38,020
They need you in Command.

894
00:50:38,022 --> 00:50:40,089
W've proven that
there's an asteroid.

895
00:50:40,091 --> 00:50:41,891
Is Colonel Singh working
with the Pentagon?

896
00:50:41,893 --> 00:50:46,730
He is and he needs
you and me, the entire team.

897
00:50:47,731 --> 00:50:49,064
- Come on.
- Let's go.

898
00:50:49,066 --> 00:50:50,567
Let's go.

899
00:51:02,712 --> 00:51:04,412
Sir, we just
received a priority alert

900
00:51:04,414 --> 00:51:05,781
on the data cloud.

901
00:51:05,783 --> 00:51:07,649
So has every other
major observatory

902
00:51:07,651 --> 00:51:09,651
across three continents.

903
00:51:09,653 --> 00:51:11,452
Who's sending this out?

904
00:51:11,454 --> 00:51:14,089
NASA, JPL, AMS and FEMA
just forwarded it

905
00:51:14,091 --> 00:51:15,590
from our base in Wyoming.

906
00:51:15,592 --> 00:51:17,193
I's a live vectoring model.

907
00:51:17,195 --> 00:51:19,360
What do the vectors target?

908
00:51:19,362 --> 00:51:20,930
We do't know, sir.

909
00:51:20,932 --> 00:51:23,866
I's a field, sir,
with precise measurements,

910
00:51:23,868 --> 00:51:25,968
2.18 miles,

911
00:51:25,970 --> 00:51:29,504
1.31 miles, 2.62.

912
00:51:34,611 --> 00:51:36,278
I have Ambrose
on the line, sir.

913
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,114
Ah...

914
00:51:39,116 --> 00:51:40,850
General Ambrose?

915
00:51:40,852 --> 00:51:43,185
I's Colonel Singh. Wyoming.

916
00:51:43,187 --> 00:51:46,354
Our research team just confirmed
a million megaton, sir.

917
00:51:46,356 --> 00:51:47,923
Mm-hm.

918
00:51:47,925 --> 00:51:50,025
We have a Near Earth Object
with all intel

919
00:51:50,027 --> 00:51:51,559
uploaded to DOD's data.

920
00:51:56,868 --> 00:51:59,301
General!
W're calling for a two-stage...

921
00:52:02,739 --> 00:52:04,706
Phew!

922
00:52:04,708 --> 00:52:06,474
General, we have to
launch these missiles now!

923
00:52:06,476 --> 00:52:09,377
Phaeton's gravitation field is
accelerating the meteor shower.

924
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:11,646
I's only gonna get worse!

925
00:52:11,648 --> 00:52:13,717
This whole place
is gonna blow!

926
00:52:21,859 --> 00:52:23,691
Sir! Wyoming has been hit!

927
00:52:23,693 --> 00:52:25,227
Without the orbital shield,

928
00:52:25,229 --> 00:52:27,629
Phaetho's projecting
meteors straight at us.

929
00:52:27,631 --> 00:52:29,365
Do we have any communication?

930
00:52:29,367 --> 00:52:31,499
Sir, we have a signal, but
it keeps cutting in and out.

931
00:52:31,501 --> 00:52:33,035
Colonel Singh would't
have called

932
00:52:33,037 --> 00:52:35,237
unless he was requesting
a severe response.

933
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:39,074
Keep working to get the
remaining of our nukes operable.

934
00:52:39,076 --> 00:52:40,378
Copy that, sir.

935
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,446
All right, the main
evacuation rout is this way.

936
00:52:45,448 --> 00:52:47,216
Come on.

937
00:52:47,218 --> 00:52:48,516
Oh, we ca't leave until
we make sure that Ambrose

938
00:52:48,518 --> 00:52:50,252
has the proper information.

939
00:52:50,254 --> 00:52:51,653
We ca't stay, Gwen.
The base has been compromised.

940
00:52:51,655 --> 00:52:52,922
I's too dangerous.
Come on!

941
00:52:52,924 --> 00:52:54,722
I need to see this through.

942
00:52:54,724 --> 00:52:56,358
Okay, I'm not leaving until
I'm sure that

943
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,625
the're gonna launch everything
according to plan.

944
00:52:57,627 --> 00:52:59,061
Sir! Come on!

945
00:52:59,063 --> 00:53:01,063
We have to evacuate
to Washington now!

946
00:53:01,065 --> 00:53:04,168
Gwen, we need to leave now.
Please?

947
00:53:05,369 --> 00:53:08,172
Michael, no!

948
00:53:11,441 --> 00:53:13,208
You okay?

949
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:14,410
Yeah, yeah.

950
00:53:14,412 --> 00:53:16,111
- Okay, where do we go?
- Okay.

951
00:53:16,113 --> 00:53:19,415
All right, we need to exit back
through the Command Room.

952
00:53:19,417 --> 00:53:21,150
- Come on.
- Okay. Let's go.

953
00:53:31,494 --> 00:53:33,062
You okay?

954
00:53:33,064 --> 00:53:35,900
Yeah. You?

955
00:53:38,936 --> 00:53:42,139
Michael, wher's
the Control Room?

956
00:53:45,675 --> 00:53:47,411
Straight this way.

957
00:53:49,013 --> 00:53:50,511
All right.

958
00:53:50,513 --> 00:53:51,512
W'll go through the wall.

959
00:53:52,917 --> 00:53:54,986
W're not going
through that wall.

960
00:53:57,254 --> 00:53:59,154
Tha's solid concrete
six inches thick.

961
00:53:59,156 --> 00:54:03,461
W'll cut straight
through with this, hm?

962
00:54:10,267 --> 00:54:12,103
Almost there.

963
00:54:14,738 --> 00:54:16,405
- You through?
- Yep.

964
00:54:16,407 --> 00:54:17,439
- Go for it.
- Here goes nothing!

965
00:54:17,441 --> 00:54:18,943
Yep.

966
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:23,511
- Good.
- Nice job.

967
00:54:38,929 --> 00:54:41,098
The roo's collapsed here, too.

968
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:47,870
We can get there through
the annex bridge.

969
00:54:47,872 --> 00:54:49,371
- Okay?
- Yeah.

970
00:54:49,373 --> 00:54:51,739
Thanks.

971
00:54:51,741 --> 00:54:53,511
This way!

972
00:55:05,823 --> 00:55:07,990
Wyoming!
Go for Ambrose!

973
00:55:07,992 --> 00:55:09,792
General, this is
Gwen Armstrong.

974
00:55:09,794 --> 00:55:12,027
Do you have a
confirmed target?

975
00:55:12,029 --> 00:55:14,196
I's an asteroid, sir.
Two-square miles.

976
00:55:14,198 --> 00:55:15,431
I've sent you all
the data.

977
00:55:15,433 --> 00:55:17,732
What is the ETA to impact?

978
00:55:17,734 --> 00:55:19,201
One hour and 15 minutes.

979
00:55:19,203 --> 00:55:20,735
The strike requires
a two-step response,

980
00:55:20,737 --> 00:55:22,570
50% into the meteor cloud

981
00:55:22,572 --> 00:55:24,739
and 50% directly into
the asteroid.

982
00:55:24,741 --> 00:55:25,740
No! Gwen!

983
00:55:34,218 --> 00:55:35,953
Whoa!

984
00:55:37,587 --> 00:55:38,653
Babe, you okay?

985
00:55:38,655 --> 00:55:40,055
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You?

986
00:55:40,057 --> 00:55:40,989
Yeah.

987
00:55:40,991 --> 00:55:42,657
Go! Get to the entrance!

988
00:55:42,659 --> 00:55:45,029
Mara, go, go, go, go!

989
00:55:51,368 --> 00:55:52,801
Just get to the entrance!

990
00:55:52,803 --> 00:55:54,438
I'll come.

991
00:55:55,773 --> 00:55:57,973
- Colonel, go!
- Go, just go! Go!

992
00:55:57,975 --> 00:56:00,444
Help the others,
I'm right behind you.

993
00:56:01,479 --> 00:56:02,677
Gwen, come on, baby!

994
00:56:02,679 --> 00:56:05,349
Okay, okay, w're coming.

995
00:56:06,317 --> 00:56:08,784
Oh, man.

996
00:56:08,786 --> 00:56:09,785
Come on!

997
00:56:14,792 --> 00:56:16,327
Gwen, come on!

998
00:56:27,404 --> 00:56:29,406
Here! Take my hand.

999
00:56:31,008 --> 00:56:32,476
Come on! Let go of the bag!

1000
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:37,982
No!

1001
00:56:39,517 --> 00:56:41,617
I can lift you!

1002
00:56:41,619 --> 00:56:44,021
I shoul've listened
to you from the start.

1003
00:56:47,525 --> 00:56:49,326
Oh...

1004
00:57:12,917 --> 00:57:15,851
All right,
ladies and gentlemen.

1005
00:57:15,853 --> 00:57:18,887
Our two-mile wide field
is an incoming asteroid.

1006
00:57:18,889 --> 00:57:20,688
Sir, are we talking
about the one

1007
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:21,857
that disappeared behind the sun?
Phaeton?

1008
00:57:21,859 --> 00:57:23,325
Tha's affirmative.

1009
00:57:23,327 --> 00:57:25,693
We need to use the rest
of our nukes

1010
00:57:25,695 --> 00:57:28,297
on a stage-two
Level Five response.

1011
00:57:28,299 --> 00:57:30,966
We need to set our
targeting system

1012
00:57:30,968 --> 00:57:33,435
so that the first wave
of nukes all hit

1013
00:57:33,437 --> 00:57:37,539
the exact same spot
of the meteor cloud.

1014
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:40,375
That will create a compound
wave to dissipate the cloud

1015
00:57:40,377 --> 00:57:43,078
and reveal the bigger asteroid
so we can target it.

1016
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:46,381
Tha's brilliant, sir!

1017
00:57:46,383 --> 00:57:50,052
This is Gwen Armstron's plan,
and yes it is.

1018
00:57:50,054 --> 00:57:53,555
Sir? We just lost two more
communication satellites.

1019
00:57:53,557 --> 00:57:57,659
But we do have communication
with other surviving bases.

1020
00:57:57,661 --> 00:57:59,795
Prepare for the first wave!

1021
00:57:59,797 --> 00:58:01,630
Yes, sir.

1022
00:58:01,632 --> 00:58:02,965
Stand by!

1023
00:58:02,967 --> 00:58:04,501
Level Five!

1024
00:58:07,905 --> 00:58:09,440
Level Five is go.

1025
00:58:13,611 --> 00:58:15,412
Level Five is go.

1026
00:58:22,453 --> 00:58:24,453
Level Five is go.

1027
00:58:24,455 --> 00:58:27,258
50% response! Go!

1028
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,763
Heat signature at 4%, 2%.

1029
00:59:06,765 --> 00:59:08,130
Sir, it's working!

1030
00:59:08,132 --> 00:59:10,599
The cloud is beginning
to dissipate.

1031
00:59:10,601 --> 00:59:12,636
Heat signature one percent.

1032
00:59:18,609 --> 00:59:20,509
Level Five, stage two!

1033
00:59:20,511 --> 00:59:22,644
Target that asteroid.

1034
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:25,015
50% Go!

1035
00:59:38,729 --> 00:59:40,195
The asteroid is still intact.

1036
00:59:40,197 --> 00:59:41,897
The nukes were ineffective, sir.

1037
00:59:41,899 --> 00:59:43,832
They were unable to make
contact with target.

1038
00:59:43,834 --> 00:59:46,435
Damn it!

1039
00:59:46,437 --> 00:59:49,004
Impact estimated
at 38 minutes.

1040
00:59:49,006 --> 00:59:51,139
Make sure the President,
Congress

1041
00:59:51,141 --> 00:59:53,342
and Joint Chiefs of
Staff are evacuated

1042
00:59:53,344 --> 00:59:56,180
- to the Doomsday Bunker.
- Yes, sir!

1043
01:00:00,017 --> 01:00:01,583
We are now being informed
that the mission

1044
01:00:01,585 --> 01:00:05,153
to destroy the incoming
asteroid was unsuccessful.

1045
01:00:05,155 --> 01:00:07,456
A general evacuation order
has been issued

1046
01:00:07,458 --> 01:00:10,525
for the entire East Coast
of the United States.

1047
01:00:10,527 --> 01:00:12,694
W've also received word
that the presiden's motorcade

1048
01:00:12,696 --> 01:00:17,099
is being redirected to the Raven
rock bunker in Pennsylvania.

1049
01:00:17,101 --> 01:00:18,433
God help us all.

1050
01:00:18,435 --> 01:00:19,701
Gwen?

1051
01:00:19,703 --> 01:00:21,370
- Gwen!
- No! We have to go!

1052
01:00:21,372 --> 01:00:23,505
No! W're not having another
Russia incident!

1053
01:00:23,507 --> 01:00:25,240
Michael, with all due respect,
you were not there!

1054
01:00:25,242 --> 01:00:26,875
She did what she was
supposed to be doing.

1055
01:00:26,877 --> 01:00:29,578
Did she? She had 15 minutes
before that order came in

1056
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:31,213
to ground those planes!

1057
01:00:31,215 --> 01:00:34,116
Gwen! Are you okay?

1058
01:00:34,118 --> 01:00:36,918
I gave her
the orders, Michael.

1059
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:39,020
It was my fault, okay?

1060
01:00:39,022 --> 01:00:40,722
We were supposed
to meet Kurt in Russia!

1061
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:42,792
I'm the one that told her
to stay behind.

1062
01:00:42,794 --> 01:00:45,026
It was my fault, Michael.

1063
01:00:45,028 --> 01:00:47,729
She stayed because of me.

1064
01:00:47,731 --> 01:00:49,998
Well, they didn't have to
pin the whole thing on you.

1065
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,334
Michael...

1066
01:00:52,336 --> 01:00:56,671
Okay! How much time
do we have left, Gwen?

1067
01:00:56,673 --> 01:00:58,306
We have 34 minutes.

1068
01:00:58,308 --> 01:01:00,976
And we already launched
Phase One and Phase Two

1069
01:01:00,978 --> 01:01:02,577
of the nukes, right?

1070
01:01:02,579 --> 01:01:04,413
So what's Plan B, guys?

1071
01:01:04,415 --> 01:01:06,148
Plan B is we make
our way to the airfield

1072
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:07,616
about a mile from here.

1073
01:01:07,618 --> 01:01:08,950
Now there's two birds
on the ground.

1074
01:01:08,952 --> 01:01:10,652
We evac to safety, all of us!

1075
01:01:10,654 --> 01:01:12,988
No, no, no.
W're not gonna evacuate yet.

1076
01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:14,456
Look, there could be
a solution here.

1077
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:18,026
I's a long shot,
but it could work.

1078
01:01:18,028 --> 01:01:19,728
The Braeburg Effect.

1079
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:20,929
Braeburg?

1080
01:01:20,931 --> 01:01:22,397
Come on, Gwen, enough of that!

1081
01:01:22,399 --> 01:01:23,965
You know he's a laughing
stock of our community!

1082
01:01:23,967 --> 01:01:25,700
Okay, but, Kurt,
listen to me, okay?

1083
01:01:25,702 --> 01:01:27,837
The last few hours,
I've been noticing

1084
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:29,971
that all this meteor impact
has displaced methane

1085
01:01:29,973 --> 01:01:31,406
into the atmosphere.

1086
01:01:31,408 --> 01:01:32,875
When you add
an electrical force to methane

1087
01:01:32,877 --> 01:01:34,811
it turns into plasma vapor.

1088
01:01:34,813 --> 01:01:38,013
Now the tests I took this
morning of that meteor,

1089
01:01:38,015 --> 01:01:39,681
it proves that it
has magnetic force.

1090
01:01:39,683 --> 01:01:43,685
So if we somehow find
6,000 megawatts of electricity

1091
01:01:43,687 --> 01:01:47,122
and create an electrical arc
up into the atmosphere,

1092
01:01:47,124 --> 01:01:48,490
it could actually displace

1093
01:01:48,492 --> 01:01:49,926
that electromagnetic force
and then....

1094
01:01:49,928 --> 01:01:51,761
And the nukes
and the meteors

1095
01:01:51,763 --> 01:01:52,994
and the asteroid all
crashing together.

1096
01:01:52,996 --> 01:01:54,864
Yes, and destroy them.

1097
01:01:54,866 --> 01:01:56,398
Okay, I understand that,

1098
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,133
but where are we gonna get that
power, that wattage?

1099
01:01:58,135 --> 01:02:00,702
We do't have that.

1100
01:02:00,704 --> 01:02:02,671
There's a power plant
not far from the airfield.

1101
01:02:02,673 --> 01:02:04,139
Can we use that?

1102
01:02:04,141 --> 01:02:06,241
Yes, but we would
need some sort of...

1103
01:02:06,243 --> 01:02:07,642
A massive controlled
explosion!

1104
01:02:07,644 --> 01:02:09,177
Exactly.

1105
01:02:09,179 --> 01:02:11,146
One of those F-35s has
to be stocked with missiles.

1106
01:02:11,148 --> 01:02:12,849
Okay, okay.
Let's go to the hangar!

1107
01:02:12,851 --> 01:02:14,149
Let's go! Let's go!

1108
01:02:14,151 --> 01:02:15,586
Okay, let's get
to the airfield!

1109
01:02:22,526 --> 01:02:23,960
Let's go!
Come on, come on!

1110
01:02:23,962 --> 01:02:26,196
Okay, the base
is through the field!

1111
01:02:29,333 --> 01:02:31,032
For those of you at home
or hopefully

1112
01:02:31,034 --> 01:02:32,400
having found shelter,

1113
01:02:32,402 --> 01:02:34,871
we have an update
from Pentagon officials.

1114
01:02:34,873 --> 01:02:38,340
Raging fires are widespread
throughout North America

1115
01:02:38,342 --> 01:02:41,009
as a result of
the massive meteor shore.

1116
01:02:41,011 --> 01:02:45,547
Hundreds of thousands of home
have been damaged or destroyed.

1117
01:02:45,549 --> 01:02:49,651
Injuries and deaths are
estimated to be in the hundreds.

1118
01:02:49,653 --> 01:02:52,420
The national weather service is
now reporting that this storm

1119
01:02:52,422 --> 01:02:55,123
is due to a
gravitational slowdown

1120
01:02:55,125 --> 01:02:57,259
from inside of the meteor cloud,

1121
01:02:57,261 --> 01:02:59,929
caused by
two-mile-wide Phaethon asteroid

1122
01:02:59,931 --> 01:03:04,266
which is due to impact
Earth within the hour.

1123
01:03:04,268 --> 01:03:06,635
Come on, guys!
Come on! Come on!

1124
01:03:06,637 --> 01:03:08,303
Come on!

1125
01:03:08,305 --> 01:03:10,907
Let's go! Come on!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1126
01:03:10,909 --> 01:03:14,879
Come on! Move it! Move it!
Let's go, Kurt. Come on!

1127
01:03:20,083 --> 01:03:22,752
Whoa!

1128
01:04:21,045 --> 01:04:22,646
Come on! Come on!

1129
01:04:24,381 --> 01:04:26,483
Let's go!
This way, this way!

1130
01:04:28,853 --> 01:04:29,988
Whoa!

1131
01:04:32,023 --> 01:04:33,555
Okay! I can see it!

1132
01:04:33,557 --> 01:04:34,957
Another 300 yards
and w're there!

1133
01:04:34,959 --> 01:04:36,959
Let's go! Come on!
Move, move, move!

1134
01:04:36,961 --> 01:04:38,695
Keep moving!
Keep moving!

1135
01:04:49,373 --> 01:04:51,809
Down, down, down!
Get down! Down!

1136
01:04:56,613 --> 01:04:58,080
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1137
01:04:58,082 --> 01:04:59,147
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1138
01:04:59,149 --> 01:05:00,950
Okay, okay.

1139
01:05:00,952 --> 01:05:03,919
Mara, you scour this field.

1140
01:05:03,921 --> 01:05:05,253
Find that jet.

1141
01:05:05,255 --> 01:05:06,922
Let's just pray
that puppy is armed

1142
01:05:06,924 --> 01:05:07,923
with striking capabilities.

1143
01:05:07,925 --> 01:05:09,424
I got it.

1144
01:05:09,426 --> 01:05:10,826
Now this incoming
w're experiencing,

1145
01:05:10,828 --> 01:05:12,094
I can only imagine
is gonna get worse.

1146
01:05:12,096 --> 01:05:13,428
So, Kurt, you go with her.

1147
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:15,097
You ensure her success, okay?

1148
01:05:15,099 --> 01:05:16,431
- Yeah.
- Okay?

1149
01:05:16,433 --> 01:05:17,867
- Copy that.
- All right.

1150
01:05:17,869 --> 01:05:19,401
Gwen and I are gonna
locate a power source.

1151
01:05:19,403 --> 01:05:20,903
The transformer is on

1152
01:05:20,905 --> 01:05:22,972
the other side of the
airfield, due west.

1153
01:05:22,974 --> 01:05:25,875
Okay, perfect.
Meet back here.

1154
01:05:29,279 --> 01:05:32,716
Okay, go! Go! Go!

1155
01:05:44,728 --> 01:05:46,697
Gwen, come on!

1156
01:05:50,134 --> 01:05:52,602
Okay, go! Go!
Go! Go!

1157
01:05:58,009 --> 01:05:59,743
Okay, okay.

1158
01:06:02,679 --> 01:06:04,882
Gwen? Come on.

1159
01:06:07,952 --> 01:06:09,919
There!
There it is.

1160
01:06:09,921 --> 01:06:12,788
I see it! Let's go!

1161
01:06:14,591 --> 01:06:15,991
Okay.

1162
01:06:15,993 --> 01:06:17,461
Okay, go.

1163
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:27,136
Okay. Hand me the iPad, Gwen!

1164
01:06:27,138 --> 01:06:28,806
All right.

1165
01:06:30,174 --> 01:06:32,174
Oh, God!

1166
01:06:32,176 --> 01:06:34,810
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1167
01:06:34,812 --> 01:06:36,178
- Okay.
- Here you go, Michael.

1168
01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:37,278
Hold it.

1169
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:38,513
Okay.

1170
01:06:38,515 --> 01:06:40,248
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1171
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:41,753
Okay.

1172
01:06:45,957 --> 01:06:47,091
Oh!

1173
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:52,061
Please make this fast, okay?

1174
01:06:52,063 --> 01:06:53,461
I'm trying, I'm trying,
I'm trying.

1175
01:06:53,463 --> 01:06:54,797
- W're in!
- Okay.

1176
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:56,331
Okay.

1177
01:06:56,333 --> 01:06:58,801
My security clearance should
give me access to the main grid.

1178
01:06:58,803 --> 01:07:00,870
Okay, I'm redirecting
all kilowatts

1179
01:07:00,872 --> 01:07:05,875
within a 100-mile radius
to transformer 47.

1180
01:07:05,877 --> 01:07:06,976
Okay. 47.

1181
01:07:06,978 --> 01:07:08,343
What are those coordinates,
Michael?

1182
01:07:08,345 --> 01:07:09,444
Give me a minute.

1183
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:21,893
Ah!

1184
01:07:24,028 --> 01:07:25,227
Are you okay?

1185
01:07:25,229 --> 01:07:26,228
Are you having fun yet, doc?

1186
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:27,595
Am I having fun?

1187
01:07:27,597 --> 01:07:30,065
You're crazy.
Come on. Come on, Mara.

1188
01:07:30,067 --> 01:07:31,466
Come on.
Come on, Mara.

1189
01:07:31,468 --> 01:07:33,838
Almost there, come on.

1190
01:07:40,244 --> 01:07:42,546
Okay. You're okay.

1191
01:07:43,881 --> 01:07:46,248
There's the entrance
to the hangar.

1192
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:47,919
Let's go, go, go, go!

1193
01:07:58,963 --> 01:08:00,495
Got'em!
Sending to you now!

1194
01:08:00,497 --> 01:08:01,663
- Okay, great.
- You got'em.

1195
01:08:01,665 --> 01:08:05,034
Plugging those in, the equation.

1196
01:08:05,036 --> 01:08:06,304
Let's see if this works.

1197
01:08:08,873 --> 01:08:10,775
Put that here.

1198
01:08:12,810 --> 01:08:13,976
Put this...

1199
01:08:13,978 --> 01:08:18,713
So with that frequency,
those coordinates,

1200
01:08:18,715 --> 01:08:22,350
that dimension,
at that speed...

1201
01:08:22,352 --> 01:08:23,685
What do you got, baby?

1202
01:08:23,687 --> 01:08:25,321
This is gonna work...

1203
01:08:25,323 --> 01:08:27,156
Michael, it's gonna work.

1204
01:08:27,158 --> 01:08:29,992
Okay.

1205
01:08:31,461 --> 01:08:33,863
- Come on, Gwen! Come on!
- We gotta go!

1206
01:08:33,865 --> 01:08:35,132
Let's go!

1207
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:48,844
W're gonna have
to taxi this jet.

1208
01:08:48,846 --> 01:08:50,312
Yeah.

1209
01:08:50,314 --> 01:08:52,049
Who's the chauffer now?

1210
01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:00,724
Mara?

1211
01:09:02,592 --> 01:09:04,161
There's no missiles.

1212
01:09:04,829 --> 01:09:06,230
There's no missiles.

1213
01:09:11,168 --> 01:09:12,902
We gotta go tell 'em.

1214
01:09:12,904 --> 01:09:15,306
Let's go tell'em.
Come on.

1215
01:09:16,506 --> 01:09:18,242
Come on

1216
01:09:19,476 --> 01:09:21,379
Damn it.
Come on.

1217
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:27,515
Mara! Kurt!

1218
01:09:27,517 --> 01:09:29,651
F-35, end of the tarmac.

1219
01:09:29,653 --> 01:09:31,686
- 10% fuel.
- I's okay.

1220
01:09:31,688 --> 01:09:34,924
Gwen, there's no missiles.

1221
01:09:34,926 --> 01:09:35,891
Shit!

1222
01:09:35,893 --> 01:09:38,227
- Um...
- Tha's it.

1223
01:09:38,229 --> 01:09:39,828
What?

1224
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:43,267
I's over.
There's nothing we can do.

1225
01:09:44,101 --> 01:09:47,669
There's got to be.
Okay.

1226
01:09:47,671 --> 01:09:48,837
There's nothing
left we can do!

1227
01:09:48,839 --> 01:09:52,174
The jet becomes the missile.

1228
01:09:52,176 --> 01:09:55,244
By taking off,
the jet becomes the missile.

1229
01:09:55,246 --> 01:09:57,679
I just take off and fly it
straight up into the air

1230
01:09:57,681 --> 01:09:59,815
and come down at Mach speed
to that electrical plant

1231
01:09:59,817 --> 01:10:01,383
and hit it right in the
center...

1232
01:10:01,385 --> 01:10:02,617
Gwen, what are
you talking about?

1233
01:10:02,619 --> 01:10:03,852
No on's getting
inside that jet!

1234
01:10:03,854 --> 01:10:05,356
Tha's a suicide mission!

1235
01:10:06,958 --> 01:10:08,759
And you know what?
There's gotta be another way!

1236
01:10:10,527 --> 01:10:12,094
You're not thinking straight.

1237
01:10:12,096 --> 01:10:14,163
No.
No on's getting into that jet!

1238
01:10:14,165 --> 01:10:16,432
I's over.

1239
01:10:16,434 --> 01:10:18,067
Just get me into the sat com.
I'll figure it out.

1240
01:10:18,069 --> 01:10:19,835
Just link to help me back up
with the nukes.

1241
01:10:19,837 --> 01:10:21,305
Okay, you can do that
through the computer.

1242
01:10:28,478 --> 01:10:30,478
Here we go.

1243
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,217
The fuel is at 10%.

1244
01:10:34,385 --> 01:10:37,585
- Gwen? Gwen!
- Gwen! Gwen!

1245
01:10:37,587 --> 01:10:39,154
Michael stop, she's gone.

1246
01:10:39,156 --> 01:10:43,558
Her best bet will be
to parachute into an open field

1247
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,928
We gotta get to an open field.
We gotta get to an open field!

1248
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:47,528
Come on, le's go!
Move it!

1249
01:10:47,530 --> 01:10:50,334
- Let's go find an open field!
- Come on, come on!

1250
01:10:56,874 --> 01:10:59,308
Initiate flight sequencing.

1251
01:10:59,310 --> 01:11:04,746
On, engaged.
Engine one, on.

1252
01:11:04,748 --> 01:11:07,118
Flight time: three minutes.

1253
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:15,059
Let's do this.

1254
01:11:17,228 --> 01:11:18,927
Okay, come here!

1255
01:11:18,929 --> 01:11:20,695
She's gotta land here, okay?

1256
01:11:20,697 --> 01:11:22,064
This is the only spot
that she can land.

1257
01:11:22,066 --> 01:11:24,068
All right.

1258
01:11:28,705 --> 01:11:30,671
Gwen, do you copy?

1259
01:11:30,673 --> 01:11:32,810
I read you five
by five, Michael.

1260
01:11:34,677 --> 01:11:36,247
Engine engaged.

1261
01:12:35,039 --> 01:12:37,573
Sir, our radar is
detecting an object

1262
01:12:37,575 --> 01:12:40,776
moving the speed of sound
flying up out of Wyoming.

1263
01:12:40,778 --> 01:12:42,945
- Do we have an ID on it?
- No.

1264
01:12:42,947 --> 01:12:45,116
We do't know
what it is yet, sir.

1265
01:13:01,966 --> 01:13:03,601
Starting ascent.

1266
01:13:15,146 --> 01:13:16,711
Gwen!

1267
01:13:16,713 --> 01:13:18,315
Come in, Gwen!
Gwen, come in!

1268
01:13:46,977 --> 01:13:50,080
Looks like it's one of ours,
sir, an F-35.

1269
01:13:59,490 --> 01:14:01,559
One minute, three seconds.

1270
01:14:05,396 --> 01:14:06,828
T-minus 1 minute.

1271
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:08,230
Engaging F35 dive

1272
01:14:08,232 --> 01:14:10,698
in 5, 4,

1273
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:14,138
3, 2, 1, now!

1274
01:14:17,208 --> 01:14:18,941
Gwen, you get outta there!

1275
01:14:18,943 --> 01:14:21,145
You make sure you get
outta there, Gwen!

1276
01:14:24,114 --> 01:14:25,914
Gwen, do you copy?
Make sure you get outta there!

1277
01:14:25,916 --> 01:14:27,549
Come on, Gwen.

1278
01:14:27,551 --> 01:14:29,553
45 seconds!

1279
01:14:37,461 --> 01:14:41,530
I'm getting high level
radiation warnings.

1280
01:14:41,532 --> 01:14:43,434
Damn it, come on.

1281
01:14:57,815 --> 01:15:01,483
Really starting to feel
the Gs, here.

1282
01:15:01,485 --> 01:15:04,453
Ejecting in 10, 9...

1283
01:15:04,455 --> 01:15:07,258
Eight, seven, six...

1284
01:15:12,830 --> 01:15:14,131
Five...

1285
01:15:15,599 --> 01:15:17,034
four...

1286
01:15:18,335 --> 01:15:20,437
Three...

1287
01:15:30,547 --> 01:15:32,149
Gwen, do you copy?

1288
01:16:08,919 --> 01:16:11,488
One.

1289
01:16:26,837 --> 01:16:28,505
They did it!

1290
01:16:32,009 --> 01:16:33,709
The target!

1291
01:16:33,711 --> 01:16:35,344
The target has been neutralized!

1292
01:16:35,346 --> 01:16:37,379
You heard correctly,
ladies and gentlemen!

1293
01:16:37,381 --> 01:16:39,881
The asteroi's been destroyed!

1294
01:16:41,919 --> 01:16:43,852
W're clear!
W're all clear!

1295
01:16:43,854 --> 01:16:45,189
Oh, my God.

1296
01:16:47,991 --> 01:16:50,625
Lieutenant Armstrong,
we can confirm

1297
01:16:50,627 --> 01:16:53,061
Phaeton has been eliminated.
Is your wife all right?

1298
01:16:53,063 --> 01:16:55,530
Where is she?
Where is she?

1299
01:16:55,532 --> 01:16:56,965
Gwen!

1300
01:16:56,967 --> 01:16:59,034
Lieutenant Armstrong!
Do you copy?

1301
01:16:59,036 --> 01:17:00,805
Where is she?

1302
01:17:02,841 --> 01:17:06,778
General, this is Dr. Siegel,
no sign of her yet.

1303
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:09,580
Where is she?

1304
01:17:17,822 --> 01:17:19,323
There!

1305
01:17:23,394 --> 01:17:27,231
We have a visual on
Dr. Armstrong, sh's alive!

1306
01:17:28,065 --> 01:17:29,566
She made it!

1307
01:17:34,037 --> 01:17:38,175
Woo! Woo!

1308
01:17:54,925 --> 01:17:57,161
She's coming in for a landing.

1309
01:18:06,703 --> 01:18:08,970
Oh...

1310
01:18:17,714 --> 01:18:20,184
Hey, doc.

1311
01:18:29,059 --> 01:18:30,862
You're crazy.

1312
01:18:32,563 --> 01:18:34,164
I had to.

1313
01:18:36,233 --> 01:18:39,201
What was the probability
of that happening, huh?

1314
01:18:39,203 --> 01:18:41,303
We did it.

1315
01:18:41,305 --> 01:18:43,808
You're crazy... you're crazy.

1316
01:18:48,645 --> 01:18:49,948
You did it...

1317
01:18:51,982 --> 01:18:53,381
Dr. Braeburg.

1318
01:18:53,383 --> 01:18:55,517
Shh. The world does't
need to know.

1319
01:18:55,519 --> 01:18:57,954
- The world needs to know.
- No, no, no.

1320
01:18:57,956 --> 01:19:00,925
No. The world is safe now.

1321
01:19:13,170 --> 01:19:15,840
Kurt! Mara!

1322
01:19:17,641 --> 01:19:20,711
Woo! Woo!

1323
01:19:21,578 --> 01:19:23,779
What a team!

1324
01:19:23,781 --> 01:19:27,718
Well done, Colonel... sir.

1325
01:19:32,456 --> 01:19:34,291
Phew!

1326
01:20:01,697 --> 01:20:06,697
