00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:03,480
Episode 5: We're Almost Home

2
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,139
The guys are halfway through the
European run.

3
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:22,279
In addition to a lingering
sense of fatigue,

4
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:26,219
each day seems to bring
its own set of logistical challenges.

5
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,540
Yea, where are we pushing it?

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,699
Streets are small, parking is
non-existent.

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:40,320
so we detached the trailer in the middle
of the road and pushed it over here

8
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:52,119
Now we're waiting for a van to put all the
gear in so we can take it across the street

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,080
so we can set up which is supposed
to start an hour and a half ago.

10
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,079
Everything's pretty straightforward
on the US headline run

11
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:08,339
Here it's just, who knows. There's a
lot more variables a lot more unknowns.

12
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,159
Every day it's like kinda figuring out

13
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:14,240
figuring out a lot more things on the fly

14
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,200
We are in some dirty-ass loading dock in
Manchester, UK.

15
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,460
We entered some kind of time-warp
that made us fucking six hours late.

16
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,059
We should have been here a long
time ago but Holger stopped

17
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,660
and everybody was asleep and
everybody slept through it.

18
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,699
He seriously stopped at a truck stop
for five hours

19
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,939
and didn't empty the piss tank

20
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:14,600
and then get's to the venue and
empties it all over the fucking street

21
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,200
I'll run down, maybe have to
pull it down from downstairs

22
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:33,540
I'm washing my underwear in the venue
because we haven't seen the laundry

23
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,460
for days and I'm out of clean clothes

24
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,860
and this is rock 'n roll

25
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,720
What is it? Is it Tuesday night?
Is that what it is?

26
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,860
Who gives a fuck.

27
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,100
We're in Islington and we've been
discussing the election of

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,940
Kaiser Orange the 2nd.

29
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,320
The guy won the presidency.
That really fuckin' happened.

30
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,860
We should literally tweet Egomaniac all day

31
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,280
Like once...
on the hour just do hashtag Egomaniac

32
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,940
Yeah it's been an exciting fucking 24 hours
just watching the world

33
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,140
possibly come to an end
or not or who knows?

34
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,380
It's a great, great time to be a nihilist.

35
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:39,689
This European run consists of 14 shows
in 18 days but that doesn't mean they

36
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,009
have four days off. Any day without a
performance is scheduled because the

37
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,300
next gig is just too far away to make it
there in time to perform.

38
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,260
The guys take in the sights as they can
but most off days are typically spent

39
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,320
nearly entirely on a bus,
van, train or airplane.

40
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,880
So we're in Glasgow, Scotland. Michael's
hometown, Mic's hometown which is cool.

41
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,200
In this land where I can say what the fuck
I want and people understand me.

42
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,320
*SPEAKING SCOTTISH*

43
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:23,100
I flew in a day before, yeah, to catch up
with family and my best friend

44
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,100
so I caught with her and my other cousin and
my mum and my aunt... so that was really nice

45
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,320
This is my mum

46
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,620
You alright?

47
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,540
This town was the fuckin'
spearhead of the Industrial Revolution

48
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,760
The 70's... was fuckin terrible...
rife gangland violence in Glasgow man

49
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,300
You ever heard of the ice --cream wars?
Yeah that was pretty fucking bad too

50
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,480
CAMERAMAN: Doesn't sound bad

51
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,079
They weren't fighting with ice-cream

52
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,340
Jason, does this look like
something that's important?

53
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,800
Yeah it used to be an old cinema here
and it used to be a circus before that

54
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,300
When they were excavating
Prospecthill up the road

55
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,320
They found elephant bones and
they got a fuckin' archeological team in

56
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,239
to fuckin'...
"there was elephants in Scotland?"

57
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,860
No there was a circus at the ABC

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,780
and when the elephant died they just buried
it up the road and didn't tell anybody

59
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,680
GERON: How long is Mic going to
talk about the history of Scotland?

60
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,600
until I finish wiring this fuckin' plug,
dick.

61
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:29,649
Thank you for calling Advantage customer
service we're closed at this time.

62
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,079
Our normal hours are 8am to 7pm

63
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,100
That's the second time that's happened
to me I can't figure out the time zones

64
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,040
What time is it?

65
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,380
Okay Scotland

66
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,740
I fell asleep,
to be awoken by a large bang.

67
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,000
Bam bam, and I fucking see out of the
corner of my I, like, stuff flying

68
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:12,999
As the bus driver was fleeing the
scene of the crime so to speak

69
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Actually, not so to speak,
that's exactly what he did

70
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,780
And we didn't stop, we just kept going

71
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,620
Yeah, I don't know why but I'm
in a shit mood today though

72
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,619
Just in a fucking shitty mood.

73
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,719
Yea everyone's fucking sick of it.
I'm kinda nervous 'cause..

74
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,760
We have like 2 weeks left and..

75
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,899
like everyday is just
exponentially getting greater

76
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,899
my disdain for this trip.

77
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,259
And I want to just get
home as quick as possible.

78
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,319
And everyone feels like that

79
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,879
Like band and crew, the shows are great.
Everything's great, we're just fucking sick of it

80
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,800
Let's have a great.. a great
show.

81
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,959
Deep in the heart of a long tour
run, patience frays

82
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,620
and otherwise charming quirks
of travel begin to wear you out.

83
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,820
Ahh, another gig.

84
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,079
A good touring family expects this and
works together to keep spiri ts high

85
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,000
and maintain a sense of humor even
through the exhaustion and monotony

86
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
Yup, I remember when that happened

87
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,299
The guy's say goodbye to the bus and
head out for three "fly gigs" in Russia

88
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,319
and Ukraine. Two markets they've been
looking forward to playing for a long

89
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:27,460
time. However the band's draw in those
countries is completely unknown.

90
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,860
We are in Cologne, Germany

91
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,119
No we're not. We're in Dusseldorf.

92
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,339
Oh yes, we are in Dusseldorf, Germany. We were in
Cologne. We went to sleep and we woke up in Dusseldorf

93
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:43,319
We're flying to St. Petersburg,
Moscow and then Ukraine - playing Kiev.

94
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:49,319
Yeah it's pretty exciting. There's a few places
where you actually legitimately did not expect to

95
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,780
end up playing shows in when you first
join a band

96
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,360
You interpret what I say into Russian.

97
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,220
Actually I'm very excited to go to Russia - a little
nervous because of the election that's been going on

98
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,720
But seems like... (translating in Russian)

99
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,560
I'm always going to talk over you
so you just have to keep going

100
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:19,559
I'm pretty fucking excited to be here. I
wasn't expecting all this snow. I mean I know

101
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,100
it's Russia but it's only November

102
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,540
How cold is it?

103
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,540
"Fuck you" cold

104
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:47,900
Okay so I'd like to make a toast but in
the Russian tradition "zakuski",

105
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,820
You should take a shot and then follow it
up instead of a lime like tequila you put a

106
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,159
little piece of garlic or pickle
or this garlic bread

107
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,539
it's very exciting we're in like a
traditional Russian restaurant

108
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,179
on our first night here, it's pretty cool.
Thanks so much for bringing me on this week

109
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,060
And I'll do my best to stay out of trouble.

110
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,180
We're in St. Petersburg walking to the
hotel. Just had a great russian meal.

111
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:20,479
We're about to pass a little grocery
store, a sex club, a sex shop

112
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,480
And then our hotel.

113
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,300
Let's see if we make any detours... cut.

114
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,659
Where are we Jesse?

115
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,520
Am I covered in snow?

116
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,280
You are, yeah

117
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:41,300
We're on a bridge in St. Petersburg.
I wore the wrong jacket.

118
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,599
I didn't realize it was snowing out.

119
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,680
but yeah it's quite a sight.

120
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,720
We're having fun with electricity today

121
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,540
See that, that side's fucked

122
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:10,020
*Teaching Russian pronunciation of St.
Petersburg.*

123
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,400
Go click on her profile picture

124
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,500
Jesus, Geron, look at that girl, dude.
Go to Alexandra again.

125
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,779
She has a "marry now"
button on her profile.

126
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,159
Holy shit, Geron.

127
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,199
I love Russia. Russia's great.

128
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,280
*Teach Russian*

129
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,280
You literally just say "Kak"

130
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,399
Just like "Cock"

131
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
Ok, Cock.

132
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:42,040
*Speaking Russian*

133
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,100
Did you get all that?

134
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:53,159
Ticket price, venue location, night of the
week, or a conflicting sporting event can

135
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,029
mean the difference between selling out
a venue and playing to a half full room

136
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:01,379
As they play their first shows ever in
Russia and the Ukraine they are

137
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:06,740
optimistic but do not know quite what to
expect.

138
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,460
JASON: There's more
people here than Germany.

139
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,140
GERON: Are there?

140
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,780
GERON: yeah probably.

141
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,160
GERON: Germany?

142
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,380
JASON: Cologne

143
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,080
JASON: last show, two days ago

144
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,520
GERON: I don't remember that... oh yeah.

145
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,540
Yo, Mo.

146
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,179
That was a top 10 crowd.

147
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,180
Nostrovia!

148
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,620
You totally killed it.

149
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,880
Sorry I'm like sweating like monkey.
So hot in there - oh my god

150
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,279
It's about 6:00 in the
morning I think.

151
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,400
We're leaving, going to the
Ukraine to play a show in Kiev.

152
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,019
How much sleep did you get?

153
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,560
uh, 3 hours.

154
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,720
About the third show in a row
today, been a long day.

155
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,200
Watching these guys load
the gear is very tiring.

156
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:25,319
The show in Kiev was also a hit but the
guys only have a few moments to reflect

157
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:30,999
on success in Russia and Ukraine before
having to pack up and move along once again.

158
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,560
It's midnight, we are loading
the luggage room with gear.

159
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:43,220
We have to unload it at 5:30am tomorrow
and fly to Barcelona.

160
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:50,280
The last 3 shows in Europe are in Spain - another
new market for them with an unknown fanbase

161
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,159
They also remain in limbo with their
record label back home.

162
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,579
So what's our actual plan?
We've not heard back from the guy.

163
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,580
They're saying go hard at radio.

164
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:19,379
We've not communicated with our radio
team, they apparently have gone to radio..

165
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,400
whatever that means...

166
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,499
If we don't hear from them today or tomorrow..a
full week after writing a letter like that...

167
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:30,959
then that's not only a week...
That's a month, 5, 6 weeks after um..

168
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,120
saying we want off the label and we
still haven't heard anything from them

169
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,859
How do we give this song a
shot because I actually believe in it.

170
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:45,399
Well we don't have an another option. You
can't force people to do shit when you're

171
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,019
halfway across the world.

172
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:52,779
We've got the single going to radio, we're hoping
for some good data in the next holiday period

173
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,099
If that doesn't happen, it's dead

174
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,560
It's one thing to say "no let's go big let's
go to radio hard", but what the fuck does that

175
00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:00,578
mean after they've killed a campaign and

176
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:04,778
we're going back six weeks later to the
same PD's asking them to play the same

177
00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:10,239
song that we just pulled away
from. So it's one thing to say that but

178
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,420
it can potentially harm us going big if
there's not an actual strategy and plan.

179
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,640
I'm tired

180
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:22,739
Talk about divide and conquer - they're
actually doing that to us by turning

181
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,619
this entire thing negative.

182
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,160
They have killed music for us.

183
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,320
Is this a 100 watt one?

184
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:46,880
Yea I mean let's do a Bassman for the wet, I
mean yeah, Bassman for wet and this guy for dry.

185
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:57,140
They have a shitload of amps
that are....almost right.

186
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:02,539
Despite a number of presale
tickets sold, 15 minutes to Showtime

187
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,659
the crowd is surprisingly sparse

188
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,959
The thing here, the people wait until

189
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,120
More or less the end to grab some
beers outside because it's cheaper

190
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,039
To get some food outside
because it's cheaper too

191
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,340
JASON: Then they show up.

192
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:28,789
We have to do it dude, there's whatever 30
people..turn that into 50 or 60 the next time

193
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:32,960
By the time I'm 45 I'm gonna have this
career off the ground dude.

194
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,579
Dude, your funny bone...

195
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,580
I'd hit that.

196
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,260
Right on cue, the crowd showed
up as the band took the stage

197
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,879
That was definitely, that was most
improved from expectations to actuality

198
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,539
I was expecting the worst show of the tour.

199
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,260
MVP's

200
00:18:17,261 --> 00:18:21,160
It may still be the worst show of the
tour but it was still pretty good.

201
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:26,359
The band has one more show in the
coastal town of Santander before the

202
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,880
final show of the tour in Madrid

203
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,840
CAMERA: Hey mo!

204
00:18:30,841 --> 00:18:32,039
MO: Fuck off.

205
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,040
CAMERA: How's your day going?

206
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,660
Hey Danny

207
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,280
CAMERA: Fucking creepy, his eyes are open

208
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,339
Danny.

209
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,280
Is he ok? Hi

210
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,999
Danny we're doing soundcheck

211
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
DANNY: Oh my I'm fucking tired.

212
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,999
Although Santander was one of the
smallest cities they played,

213
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,480
the show provided one of the most memorable
moments of the tour

214
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:10,959
I think everybody's faces last night was
a fucking gem to be honest with you.

215
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,100
The band played the show, it was great. They
decided they weren't going to play the encore.

216
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,419
So they said play the house music,
we turned the house music on,

217
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,680
we brought the lights up in the room

218
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,860
and the crowd just wouldn't shut up.
They wouldn't leave.

219
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,540
There's only 60 70 people here but they
were going bananas for them

220
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,680
JESSE: Guys come back.

221
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,300
They had to come back out again.

222
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,440
Honestly the sooner I get off
that fucking bus, the better.

223
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,320
CAMERA: Are you excited to go home?

224
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,739
Yes very. Very excited to go home.

225
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,079
When was the last time you were home?

226
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,000
I can't remember

227
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,960
I think this tour was absolutely worth
it you know we lost a lot of money on it

228
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,579
a lot of fucking money

229
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,979
Overall it was probably worth the
money that we spent to come here

230
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,819
You know, very small shows but I think we

231
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:25,439
actually started something here.
A base for us to come back to,

232
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,959
particularly in Eastern
Europe, Russia, Poland

233
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,539
Hey Danny, uh is he in here?

234
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:39,419
Oh hi, hey go through Dylan's space and

235
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:42,600
go downstage to your position or
else you're going to be really fucked

236
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,980
JASON: We get to go home

237
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,279
JASON: Last one.

238
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,360
DANNY: Forever?

239
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,160
JASON: No, no just for a week or two.

240
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:41,160
Good morning..it's not morning if you
don't go to sleep yet

241
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,140
CAMERA: What time is it?

242
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,640
5am

243
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:51,380
It's Sunday the 20th of November, we are
going home.

244
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:58,899
After four months on the road, playing
60 shows in 30 states and 10 countries

245
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,779
The guy's head back to the
US to close out the year

246
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:04,599
with two more weeks of
playing radio festivals.

247
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:11,000
But with no single on the radio, the future
of the album remains unclear

248
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,319
Next time on Bus Call.

249
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,859
We are at our South African
childhood home in Johannesburg

250
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:36,100
We'll be working but at the same time we're
gonna try to show the crew a really good time

251
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,639
Its Oppikoppi Day.

252
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,740
Three days of just
people losing their minds

253
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,020
Now, now what do we do?
