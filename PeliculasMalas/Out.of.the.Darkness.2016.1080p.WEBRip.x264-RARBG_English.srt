1
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:34,568
Henson, bring it in.

2
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:45,045
Incoming!

3
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:53,154
Uh, Red Six, Red Six,
this is Red One, over.

4
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:54,722
Red Six,
this is Red One.

5
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:57,291
Be advised, we are
in the Northwest corner

6
00:00:57,325 --> 00:00:58,526
of the initial objective,

7
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,261
and we are taking
small-arms fire

8
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:02,796
from the Western side
of the initial objective.

9
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,432
Uh, small arms
and mortar fire.

10
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:05,533
How copy, over?

11
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,570
Well...

12
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:12,240
I think we found 'em.

13
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:13,641
What gives you
that idea?

14
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:15,876
They don't seem to be
a very big group.

15
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,845
If it's the same one.

16
00:01:17,878 --> 00:01:21,349
Well, let's keep going.

17
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:29,790
I got to say, man --

18
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:32,126
It's pretty gutsy
what you did back there.

19
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,794
You would have done
the same thing, right?

20
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,129
No, man.

21
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:36,764
That was
above and beyond.

22
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:39,167
Jenkins thinks you have
a death wish.

23
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,737
Well... it was
the right thing to do.

24
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,539
You some kind
of Captain America, now?

25
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,543
And, Tango,
where are you guys at?

26
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:51,445
You hear that?

27
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:56,150
No, they went behind.
Don't -- do not --

28
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,253
Tango, you guys there?

29
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:01,455
Uh, Red Six,
this is Red One.

30
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:03,391
Roger, last transmission,
over.

31
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:23,477
Hey, Eli.
- Yeah?

32
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:26,347
Boss wants
to see you.

33
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:36,290
Wish me luck.

34
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:42,196
Okay.

35
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,465
I'll look into it
and get back to you.

36
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,799
Hey, Jerry.

37
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:48,269
Eli, hello.

38
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:49,837
Hi.

39
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,574
Look, I want to make this
as painless as possible.

40
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:55,309
Every month I sit down

41
00:02:55,343 --> 00:02:56,744
and evaluate everybody
on the ranch.

42
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:58,812
It's something I do,
so don't take it personal.

43
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:03,684
Are we done?

44
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:06,587
First of all, I'm not gonna go
over every single reason

45
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,622
why I've come
to this decision.

46
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:09,890
I've given you
plenty of time

47
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:11,492
to make the changes
I've suggested,

48
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,395
and frankly, Eli, you're just
not suited for this job.

49
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:15,396
Figures.

50
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:17,365
There comes a time
when a father has to stop

51
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:19,867
bailing his son out,
and I believe that time is now.

52
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:24,472
I mean, I can't mold you
into something you're not.

53
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:26,874
And these men here, well,
it wouldn't be fair to them, would it

54
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:28,476
if it looks like
I'm just giving the job

55
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:30,344
to anybody walkin'
in off the prairie?

56
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:31,379
Really?

57
00:03:31,412 --> 00:03:34,248
Hey, my responsibility is
this business, Eli.

58
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:35,949
I'm just looking out
for what's best for the ranch.

59
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:38,018
You're a grown man.

60
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:38,852
No.

61
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,854
You're doing
what's best for yourself.

62
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,256
Last I checked,

63
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,258
that's your name
on the gate out there.

64
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:46,594
Look, Dad, if you don't want
to help me, then don't.

65
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:48,962
I didn't come here expecting
some handout from you.

66
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:50,798
You have got
to be kidding me.

67
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,700
That's exactly
why you came to me

68
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,935
'cause you had
nowhere else to go!

69
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,870
I obviously came
to the wrong place,

70
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,872
so I'm sorry.

71
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,408
It won't happen again.

72
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:02,343
You know what, Eli?
I got news for you, buddy.

73
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:04,011
I'm not the enemy here.

74
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:08,449
You do a right fine job driving your own life into the ground.

75
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,951
That's -- That's not
how I raised you, son.

76
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,887
I mean,
I would've thought the service would've taught you somethin' --

77
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,889
discipline, honor,
responsibility.

78
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,725
Where's all that at?

79
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:21,429
Dad, why don't you just fire me
and get this over with?

80
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:22,896
I'm trying to get you
to listen to me, Eli!

81
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,998
I am listening.

82
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:26,567
Dad, I hear you loud
and clear.

83
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,835
I don't think you do.

84
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,303
If you were smart,
you would look at this

85
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:30,838
as an opportunity
for you to stand up

86
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:33,374
and be a man for once.

87
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,809
I pray you see it
as I do for once.

88
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:37,745
Yeah, when's
the last time you prayed

89
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,847
for anybody
but yourself?

90
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:47,555
All right,
go home, Eli.

91
00:04:47,588 --> 00:04:50,991
You know, I worked really hard
to get where I'm at today.

92
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,826
I grabbed
that bull by the horns,

93
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,328
and I made something
of myself,

94
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:55,829
and I think it's high time
you did the same.

95
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,841
Mom...

96
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,510
please, you got
to help me.

97
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:19,547
No, I-I don't want you
to go against what he says,

98
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,949
it's just that I...

99
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:25,953
It's just
until I found another j--

100
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,856
W-Well, I-I don't know.

101
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,824
M-Mom, come on,
I need this.

102
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:33,594
Y-you got to help me,
please.

103
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:35,162
How can this be
for my own good?

104
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:39,032
So, you want to, uh, see
your grandchild begging

105
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,901
for change on the corner
of Main Street and --

106
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,438
No.

107
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:47,040
No, no, Mom.
Mom, I'm sorry.

108
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:50,611
D-Don't -- don't --
don't hang up.

109
00:06:50,644 --> 00:06:52,546
Don't hang u--

110
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,225
Oh, boy.

111
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,830
No!

112
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:46,700
It's gonna be
all right.

113
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:03,584
Come on, son, there's someone
who wants to meet you.

114
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:04,718
Who?

115
00:08:04,752 --> 00:08:05,786
Uh, you'll see.

116
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,788
I don't want
to meet anybody, Dad.

117
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,758
- I just want to go home.
- Trust me, Eli.

118
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:16,630
I thought
they killed you.

119
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:17,598
Oh, Kleiver?

120
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:19,933
Nah, he couldn't keep me down
for too long,

121
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,935
not even if he tried.

122
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:23,103
You know
what they say --

123
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,605
Cheaters never win
in the long run.

124
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:26,139
And next time
I get him in the ring,

125
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,808
I'm gonna get him good.

126
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,242
You're the best, Jeremy.

127
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:32,179
Is your dad gonna bring you
to the show next Saturday?

128
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,114
Can we, Dad?
Please?

129
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,816
How about we come
every week, Eli?

130
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,585
Yes!

131
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:42,189
Sounds like a pretty great dad
you got there, Eli.

132
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:43,824
Got to head back home
for the week.

133
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,158
Okay, we got to get
out of here, too, "Bubba."

134
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,861
You ready?
- Bye, Jeremy.

135
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:48,962
Bye, Eli.

136
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:50,831
Mr. Isaacson.
- Thank you, sir.

137
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,165
Thank you.

138
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:56,570
I told you he'd be okay,
didn't I, son?

139
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:57,905
Yeah.

140
00:08:57,938 --> 00:09:00,107
You were right, Dad.

141
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,675
How'd you know?

142
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:04,778
Eli, when you do
what's right --

143
00:09:04,812 --> 00:09:07,247
all the rules
and don't cheat in life --

144
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,916
you always
end up ahead.

145
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:12,219
- You're pretty smart, Dad.
- I try to be.

146
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:59,900
It's been quite a day.

147
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:09,342
Grandma, you told me
to be strong.

148
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:28,161
Paging Dr. Bender.
Paging Dr. Bender, please.

149
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:33,233
Where have you been?

150
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:34,835
I got here
as soon as I could.

151
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:37,137
Well, not soon enough.
She doesn't have much time, Eli.

152
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,305
Well, what
do you want me to say?

153
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:39,907
I'm sorry.

154
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,842
It's not us you need
to be saying you're sorry to.

155
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,878
Come on, Mom.
Don't use that tone with your mother.

156
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:48,315
I'm sorry.

157
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:53,153
She's been asking for you
for hours, Eli.

158
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:56,857
I think she's holding on
just to see you.

159
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,893
Didn't you get
any of our messages?

160
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:02,095
- Yeah, I saw them, but --
- Oh, so you got our messages,

161
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,363
so your phone's
working.

162
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,765
Yes.

163
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:06,800
- Have you been drinking?
- What?

164
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,135
You heard me.

165
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,437
Your grandmother's on her deathbed and all you can do is think

166
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,005
about being out there
indulging yourself?

167
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,908
- I was not indulging myself.
- You were drinking.

168
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:18,178
- I had one drink.
- Exactly, I knew it.

169
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:19,913
How does that make
you feel, Eli?

170
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:23,116
Your grandmother's last memory
of her grandson is him drunk.

171
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,718
What's your recruiter gonna
think about that?

172
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:26,987
I'm not drunk.

173
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,889
I was spending time
with my friends

174
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:31,925
at my sendoff party,
and some spilled her drink

175
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:33,426
on my jacket.

176
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,429
Y-You know, you always draw
these -- these ridiculous

177
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:38,298
and stupid conclusions
about me

178
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:40,267
like you -- like you think
you know me,

179
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,269
and you don't, Dad.

180
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:43,503
Okay, so I'm gonna go
spend time

181
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,139
with my dying grandmother
in the other room --

182
00:11:46,173 --> 00:11:47,307
and is the only person

183
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,977
who shows any interest
in the real me.

184
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,386
I'm gonna be
in heaven soon.

185
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,521
- No.
- I can see it.

186
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:04,357
Please, Grandma,
I need you here.

187
00:12:05,793 --> 00:12:08,929
We're never ready
to let anyone go.

188
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:12,933
No, please don't go,
not now.

189
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:15,068
Not now, please.

190
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:24,444
Someday, you're going to do
something great with your life.

191
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:27,147
You're going
to use your talents

192
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:32,085
to create something
so beautiful

193
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:36,456
and see how God was leading you
to your destination

194
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,358
the whole time.

195
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:43,463
Everything happens
for a reason, Eli.

196
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,803
You must be brave

197
00:12:49,837 --> 00:12:52,072
and take courage.

198
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:57,410
I don't know how.

199
00:12:57,444 --> 00:13:02,349
He will lead you
through the highway, Eli.

200
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:07,087
Everything is gonna be
all right...

201
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,023
even if I'm not here.

202
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:16,229
I'll always be proud
of you --

203
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:20,200
forever.

204
00:13:20,233 --> 00:13:24,838
I love you,
my darling grandson.

205
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:29,009
You must persevere.

206
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,882
Eli.

207
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:37,117
Yeah.

208
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,486
You must have faith.

209
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:53,266
I-I'm trying.

210
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,168
I'm trying, Grandma.

211
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,039
Piece of junk!

212
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,518
Daddy's here.

213
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:48,221
No, no, no.
Go sit down. Please?

214
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:51,224
- You're home early.
- Yeah.

215
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:52,592
What happened?

216
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,594
Look, Ganeen, I don't want
to talk about it, all right?

217
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,196
I'm in a bad mood.

218
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,098
Our mortgage is due
in two weeks.

219
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:00,167
You pay half of it.
We count on you.

220
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,135
And do you know that we wouldn't
be in this mess

221
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:04,204
if you hadn't quit
your dancing job?

222
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,339
You know I couldn't keep
doing that job, Eli.

223
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:07,574
Ohh.

224
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:10,143
That's right. I'm sorry.
I forgot.

225
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:12,045
You've changed.

226
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:20,653
Eli.

227
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,658
Eli, we need
to talk about this.

228
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:33,366
What?

229
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,968
You know what, Ganeen,
at some point,

230
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:39,306
I just have to stop believing
that everything is my fault.

231
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:41,708
I mean, think about it --
Either everyone I know is

232
00:15:41,741 --> 00:15:44,577
out to get me
for some reason,

233
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,647
or I have the worst luck
in the universe.

234
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,750
The universe isn't
out to get you.

235
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,452
My life isn't easy,
either.

236
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:55,655
And that's my fault,
too, right?

237
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:58,158
I shouldn't have
to have two jobs

238
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:01,561
because
you can't hold one.

239
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:04,131
If you're so unhappy,
why don't you just go?

240
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:07,134
Are we really back
at that, again?

241
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,002
Well...

242
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:12,205
guess I don't need
this, anymore.

243
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:13,540
The clothes don't make
the man, Eli.

244
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:16,009
It's not
about the stupid vest, Ganeen.

245
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:18,678
What, so, it's my fault
you lost your job?

246
00:16:18,711 --> 00:16:20,313
You sound ridiculous.

247
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:22,215
Yeah, well...

248
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:28,188
That's me --
ridiculous.

249
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:31,424
Why are you still with me
if I'm such a loser?

250
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,126
How about this --

251
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,628
I'll go.
Is that better?

252
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,698
I'll get out of the way
of your happiness.

253
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,300
Is that useful enough
for you?

254
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,770
- If you walk out again --
- What? What are you going to do?

255
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:46,173
You going to find some little --
good little Christian

256
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:48,708
and play house?

257
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,143
I'm sure he'll be pleased
to find out

258
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:53,180
about your past life
as a stripper.

259
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:58,518
Aw, I'm sorry --
"exotic dancer," right?

260
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:00,587
Yeah, that's better.

261
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:06,459
You know why
we aren't happy, Ganeen?

262
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:10,763
It is impossible to be happy
with someone like you.

263
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:17,237
I'm sorry.

264
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:33,353
Eli, don't leave.

265
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,655
Where you going, Daddy?

266
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:09,756
* I could make
a million bucks *

267
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,624
Hey, Eli.

268
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:14,661
Howdy, John.

269
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:17,130
Kind of empty here
tonight, huh?

270
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:18,531
Eh, it's all right
with me.

271
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:22,302
Hey, look, I'm, uh --
I'm sorry about what happened.

272
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,571
What happened?

273
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,407
You gettin' fired
and all.

274
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:37,150
* ...but it's on my mind *

275
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:41,821
* Oh, on my mind *

276
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:52,265
* This feeling
I'm feeling right now *

277
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:56,303
* I like it so much *

278
00:18:56,336 --> 00:19:00,440
Hey, can I get a -- get a shot
of whiskey, too, please?

279
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,446
Rough night?

280
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,148
Rough life.

281
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:15,388
How long you been coming
in here, Eli?

282
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:18,191
Um...

283
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:22,529
Well, about since you -- you
bought the place, I think.

284
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:23,930
Yeah.

285
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:25,765
It used to be a dump.

286
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:27,467
I didn't change a thing.

287
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,735
Really?

288
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,337
Yeah.

289
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:31,504
Oh...

290
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:36,476
So, I know it's none
of my business,

291
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,745
but what's going on
with you and Ganeen?

292
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:41,781
Things change, Tim.

293
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:47,287
I still remember the night
you two laid eyes on each other.

294
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,222
It was different.

295
00:19:49,256 --> 00:19:50,957
"Different"?

296
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,459
She didn't come in here
too often,

297
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:55,362
but when she did,
every guy in here would trip

298
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,497
over themselves
to catch her eye.

299
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,332
Yeah.

300
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:03,803
I remember you sittin'
about right there.

301
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:08,007
And she --
she comes up to you.

302
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,810
Yeah.

303
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,612
Like a...

304
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:15,748
like a lost puppy.

305
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:17,016
Could've been.

306
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,853
I just know that, uh,
when you two were talkin',

307
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,790
there was
a connection there,

308
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:27,560
like you were
the only two people in the room.

309
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:30,263
I don't see that
too often --

310
00:20:30,297 --> 00:20:32,599
as if it were, uh, meant
to happen.

311
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:38,938
Oh, Tim, you sound like you're
talking about God in a bar.

312
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:41,274
If you want
to call it that, sure.

313
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:47,547
Can't get away
from Him.

314
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,417
What?

315
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,285
Nothing.

316
00:20:56,423 --> 00:21:01,761
* Yeah, and I might do it
again tomorrow *

317
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:05,698
* You got a Mercedes-Benz
and a uptown smile *

318
00:21:05,732 --> 00:21:08,668
* Riding the real problem
ain't your style *

319
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:11,304
* Well, let me take you
on a knee *

320
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:15,342
* Yeah, I smell
that sweet perfume *

321
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:28,020
* And it always reminds me
of you *

322
00:21:28,054 --> 00:21:30,523
* And a few summers ago *

323
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:39,966
* I can't see it in your walk *

324
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:45,472
Night, Eli.

325
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:49,476
* And in your voice
when you talk *

326
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:29,382
* He's gonna take *

327
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:32,685
* Take it too far *

328
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:35,388
* He's running out *

329
00:22:40,527 --> 00:22:42,862
* You looking at me? *

330
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:47,133
* Hiding words *

331
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:50,770
* Not a frown... *

332
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:52,672
* And I know

333
00:23:02,682 --> 00:23:05,752
And when Jesus said that
he's the light of the world,

334
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:09,856
...that means we are
the light of the world, too.

335
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,724
We shine in the darkness.

336
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:14,427
And when light shines
in the darkness,

337
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:17,163
nothing can hide from it.

338
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,470
Of course.

339
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:27,440
* You ain't gettin'
nowhere fast *

340
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,182
Loser.

341
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:40,186
What a bunch of... idiots.

342
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:49,896
I work harder than any of them.

343
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:52,632
Take some responsibility.

344
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,604
And for what, Dad?
Why, so you can fire me?

345
00:23:57,637 --> 00:24:01,040
Thanks, "Pop."

346
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:04,877
Yeah, no matter
what you say, Dad...

347
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:06,613
I got a family.

348
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:09,482
You've been nothing
but a problem from day one.

349
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:10,950
See, Dad?

350
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:13,219
You see?

351
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:17,624
Maybe you shouldn't have been
born in our family.

352
00:24:21,561 --> 00:24:22,394
Oh, no.

353
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:24,063
Come back, Daddy.

354
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,779
Oh, boy.

355
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,129
Hello?

356
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:36,636
Hello?

357
00:25:39,071 --> 00:25:41,040
Hello?

358
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:44,110
Anyone?

359
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:47,747
Hello?

360
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,915
Hello?

361
00:25:48,948 --> 00:25:50,783
Help.

362
00:26:14,774 --> 00:26:16,643
Anyone?

363
00:26:19,646 --> 00:26:21,313
Help!

364
00:27:14,901 --> 00:27:17,036
Yeah, okay.

365
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:18,905
Now, wait, just --

366
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:20,406
I just went this way.

367
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:23,075
I just -- every --

368
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:24,944
What?

369
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,813
Hello!

370
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:31,751
Anyone!

371
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:46,432
Aah!

372
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:10,222
Don't be stupid, Eli.
It's just the wind.

373
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:34,280
Oh!

374
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:40,753
I told you
to take care of it, son.

375
00:28:40,787 --> 00:28:43,089
Take some responsibility.

376
00:28:43,122 --> 00:28:46,759
But, no, you've just been
one failure on top of another.

377
00:28:46,793 --> 00:28:50,797
You've been nothing
but a problem from day one.

378
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:54,466
Maybe you shouldn't have been
born in our family.

379
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:59,205
Or maybe you shouldn't have
been born at all.

380
00:29:07,513 --> 00:29:10,016
Yeah!
Whoo-hoo!

381
00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:15,121
Drink up, man.

382
00:29:15,154 --> 00:29:16,322
Live for today.

383
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,057
Live for tonight.

384
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,392
We shouldn't have to care
about anything else.

385
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:23,796
Just look around --
Life is one big party.

386
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,298
Who cares about Ganeen?

387
00:29:26,332 --> 00:29:27,967
Who cares
about anything!

388
00:29:32,972 --> 00:29:35,407
Yeah-ha!

389
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,999
Hey, Eli.

390
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:02,134
I'm so happy.

391
00:30:02,168 --> 00:30:05,071
The weight...

392
00:30:05,104 --> 00:30:06,805
it's been lifted.

393
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:14,180
You still don't see it,
do you?

394
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:16,248
No more striving.

395
00:30:16,282 --> 00:30:18,885
No more doubt.

396
00:30:18,918 --> 00:30:21,820
If only you opened
your eyes.

397
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,391
No.

398
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:27,126
No.

399
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:36,135
Open your eyes.

400
00:31:25,051 --> 00:31:27,486
Come on.

401
00:32:02,288 --> 00:32:04,957
We are but a vapor.

402
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:38,717
Whoo! Ooh!

403
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:41,553
Aah!

404
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:08,680
Whew!

405
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:46,618
That's it?!

406
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:50,256
That's how it's supposed to end?

407
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:54,293
I'm going to die here alone,
and no one will ever know it!

408
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:20,212
Grandson, always remember

409
00:36:20,246 --> 00:36:22,914
to put your trust in the Lord.

410
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:24,583
He'll never let you down.

411
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:27,253
I love you.

412
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:14,460
This isn't...

413
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:19,731
This doesn't make sense.
The fire should be...

414
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:22,434
Is somebody out there?

415
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:26,938
Hello!

416
00:39:46,585 --> 00:39:48,720
We may get together
to study God's word,

417
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:51,590
but you know that
it's so much more than that.

418
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:53,959
I mean, we're here
to support you.

419
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:57,095
So tell us what's going on.

420
00:39:57,128 --> 00:40:00,398
You know how Eli is.

421
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:06,572
Our last argument...

422
00:40:06,605 --> 00:40:08,574
was really bad, and...

423
00:40:13,479 --> 00:40:15,180
he left.

424
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,519
I think
that this is it.

425
00:40:20,552 --> 00:40:23,054
Do you think
he's gonna leave you?

426
00:40:25,557 --> 00:40:27,593
I don't...

427
00:40:27,626 --> 00:40:29,661
I don't know.

428
00:40:29,695 --> 00:40:30,762
I don't --

429
00:40:30,796 --> 00:40:33,198
A part of me...

430
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:35,867
just wants
to show him the door

431
00:40:35,901 --> 00:40:37,435
with his bags packed.

432
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:44,075
I'm hurting.

433
00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:45,243
And yet...

434
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,079
"And yet" what, honey?

435
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:52,150
Maybe God's trying
to show me something.

436
00:40:55,554 --> 00:40:59,591
I had a dream
last night.

437
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:03,962
And I don't remember much,
you know?

438
00:41:03,995 --> 00:41:09,100
But when I woke up
suddenly...

439
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:11,102
I heard the words,

440
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:14,205
"Eli's time has come."

441
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:19,911
And I got
this terrible feeling.

442
00:41:19,945 --> 00:41:23,649
And...

443
00:41:23,682 --> 00:41:25,216
all I could do was pray.

444
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:33,024
So, that's
what I've been doing, but...

445
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:36,895
I think
that's why we're here.

446
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:39,665
We're reinforcements.

447
00:41:39,698 --> 00:41:40,999
Come on, ladies.

448
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:47,673
Father...

449
00:41:47,706 --> 00:41:51,109
we come to you
with heavy hearts

450
00:41:51,142 --> 00:41:53,078
but hopeful hearts

451
00:41:53,111 --> 00:41:56,848
because we know
that you love us.

452
00:41:56,882 --> 00:41:59,785
And, Lord,
we want to lift up Ganeen,

453
00:41:59,818 --> 00:42:01,720
and we lift up Eli.

454
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:05,056
You know him, and you know
what he's going through.

455
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,225
And we know
that the enemy would seek

456
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:10,161
to steal, kill,
and destroy him completely.

457
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:12,631
Father,
we ask you protect him,

458
00:42:12,664 --> 00:42:14,700
that you'd reveal
yourself to him in a way

459
00:42:14,733 --> 00:42:18,103
that speaks
to his deepest heart.

460
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:21,673
We ask this
in your mighty name.

461
00:42:21,707 --> 00:42:23,141
Amen.

462
00:42:28,914 --> 00:42:30,682
I know you're out there!

463
00:42:36,722 --> 00:42:38,556
I'm armed!

464
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:48,667
Just don't come near me,
spirits of...

465
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:25,036
This is crazy.

466
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,656
Please, stop!

467
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:47,225
Why don't you help me
out of here?

468
00:43:51,162 --> 00:43:53,832
Of course you won't.

469
00:44:18,123 --> 00:44:19,958
Hello?

470
00:44:38,944 --> 00:44:41,079
Show yourself!

471
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:53,011
I miss you too, Daddy.

472
00:46:57,082 --> 00:46:58,216
Hannah?

473
00:46:58,249 --> 00:47:00,018
Come on, Daddy!

474
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:05,056
Hannah?

475
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:10,896
Where are you, darling?

476
00:47:10,929 --> 00:47:13,564
I have something
for you.

477
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:17,435
Over here, Daddy.

478
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:26,577
Hurry, Daddy.
It's just for you.

479
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,016
You're not Hannah.

480
00:47:31,049 --> 00:47:32,150
Yes I am.

481
00:47:37,055 --> 00:47:41,059
Come back, Daddy.

482
00:51:03,594 --> 00:51:06,431
- Happy with yourself?
- What?

483
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:10,735
How do I know
if this is real?

484
00:51:13,304 --> 00:51:14,872
It was you, wasn't it?

485
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,375
You're the one
who's doing all this.

486
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:18,776
No, Eli.

487
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:22,680
Then, who,
t-the Indian spirits?

488
00:51:22,713 --> 00:51:24,715
I've appeased them.

489
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:28,119
How far off the path
you have gone.

490
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:33,791
You remember,
don't you?

491
00:51:33,824 --> 00:51:36,694
It was
a long time ago.

492
00:51:36,727 --> 00:51:38,363
Eli...

493
00:51:38,396 --> 00:51:41,566
I knew that you were special
from the beginning --

494
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,401
set apart.

495
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:46,171
I don't believe in that stuff
anymore, okay?

496
00:51:46,204 --> 00:51:48,206
It's for losers.
It's for people who --

497
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:52,143
who can't make it
on their own.

498
00:51:52,177 --> 00:51:55,313
And your life is so much better without it?
You died.

499
00:51:56,714 --> 00:52:00,318
When you left,
it left.

500
00:52:04,589 --> 00:52:06,857
Eli,
are you listening?

501
00:52:36,721 --> 00:52:38,723
Eli!

502
00:52:38,756 --> 00:52:40,258
Eli Isaacson?

503
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:41,726
Yeah, I'm Eli.

504
00:52:41,759 --> 00:52:43,594
Oh, well...

505
00:52:43,628 --> 00:52:44,895
we have been looking
for you.

506
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:48,299
I-I crashed my truck,
and I'm -- I got lost.

507
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:50,301
Yeah, we know.

508
00:52:50,335 --> 00:52:53,338
- P-People are looking for me?
- Oh, definitely.

509
00:52:53,371 --> 00:52:55,373
Yeah, but I'm glad
we found you.

510
00:52:55,406 --> 00:52:57,608
Your family's been getting
a little worried about you, son.

511
00:52:57,642 --> 00:53:00,645
M-my family?

512
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,480
I-I-I --

513
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:04,415
Hey, listen, uh,
let me take a look at you.

514
00:53:04,449 --> 00:53:07,852
Let me, uh, make sure
you're doing okay.

515
00:53:07,885 --> 00:53:09,620
Hey, I-I just want
to get out of here, okay?

516
00:53:09,654 --> 00:53:11,389
I understand.
Just hold tight.

517
00:53:11,422 --> 00:53:13,358
It's all procedure.

518
00:53:13,391 --> 00:53:15,793
- Fine, can, um --
- Well, look at me, son.

519
00:53:19,764 --> 00:53:21,799
Let me see.

520
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:25,570
Well, you look fine.

521
00:53:25,603 --> 00:53:27,438
Yeah, right, "fine."

522
00:53:30,475 --> 00:53:31,776
So...

523
00:53:33,411 --> 00:53:36,714
What you doing up here
by yourself anyway?

524
00:53:36,747 --> 00:53:40,285
I just driving.

525
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:41,919
Just driving?

526
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:45,956
Listen, son, no one just drives
up here in these parts.

527
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:50,395
Yeah, well, this thing
with my girlfriend and...

528
00:53:50,428 --> 00:53:51,829
Women --

529
00:53:51,862 --> 00:53:54,932
Enough to drive you crazy.
Say no more.

530
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:56,934
I'll tell you though --
If your relationship is

531
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:58,936
causing you to drive up
so far away from home,

532
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:01,739
maybe it's ain't worth
the trouble, you know?

533
00:54:01,772 --> 00:54:02,973
Really?

534
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,842
You got to look out
for yourself, son.

535
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:06,711
You know, don't get tricked,
you know,

536
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:08,546
into thinking
that you have, you know,

537
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:11,949
all these responsibilities
to other people.

538
00:54:11,982 --> 00:54:14,018
You lose yourself
that way --

539
00:54:14,051 --> 00:54:15,920
you know, your dreams.

540
00:54:15,953 --> 00:54:18,022
It's like they say
on the airplanes

541
00:54:18,055 --> 00:54:19,390
with the oxygen masks,
you know?

542
00:54:19,424 --> 00:54:21,392
You got to put yours
on first.

543
00:54:21,426 --> 00:54:23,861
I mean, if you don't take care
of yourself first...

544
00:54:23,894 --> 00:54:25,863
there may be no "you"
to take care of.

545
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:34,839
My advice to you --
Look out for número uno.

546
00:54:34,872 --> 00:54:37,442
Yeah.

547
00:54:37,475 --> 00:54:39,410
Yeah, I guess
that makes sense.

548
00:54:39,444 --> 00:54:40,978
You are darn right
it does.

549
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:43,514
Try telling that
to my girlfriend.

550
00:54:43,548 --> 00:54:45,750
You know, you been up here
for days on end

551
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:47,452
because of her.

552
00:54:47,485 --> 00:54:49,420
You know,
she drove you to this.

553
00:54:49,454 --> 00:54:50,955
If she is
that much of a hassle,

554
00:54:50,988 --> 00:54:52,490
you need
to cut her loose, man.

555
00:54:52,523 --> 00:54:56,727
I'm sorry.
Where did you say your team was?

556
00:54:56,761 --> 00:54:57,995
Hey, man, where are we?

557
00:54:58,028 --> 00:54:59,364
Do you even know
how to get out of here?

558
00:54:59,397 --> 00:55:01,832
Hold your horses, son.
I've got a map here.

559
00:55:01,866 --> 00:55:04,502
I'll show you
where we are.

560
00:55:04,535 --> 00:55:07,372
Okay.

561
00:55:07,405 --> 00:55:10,441
Okay, so this is
where we find your truck, right?

562
00:55:10,475 --> 00:55:12,009
And this is
where we are now.

563
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:13,944
Now, if you would have kept
walking around this direction,

564
00:55:13,978 --> 00:55:15,980
you'd hit the highway.

565
00:55:16,013 --> 00:55:18,015
See, now, really,
you ain't all that far from where you started.

566
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:19,484
You're just
a little turned around is all.

567
00:55:19,517 --> 00:55:21,986
No, no, it's --
it was like a maze.

568
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:24,522
Yeah, it'll happen out here.
You got to be careful.

569
00:55:24,555 --> 00:55:26,424
These woods can play tricks
on you.

570
00:55:26,457 --> 00:55:27,958
W-what about the --
There's the --

571
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:30,027
I found
some old graveyard thing,

572
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,730
and it's not
on the map.

573
00:55:32,763 --> 00:55:34,599
Yeah, well, you know...

574
00:55:34,632 --> 00:55:36,801
I wouldn't worry too much
about that.

575
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:38,569
You know, a few days up here
by yourself, and you're bound

576
00:55:38,603 --> 00:55:40,371
to go a little bit
nutty.

577
00:55:40,405 --> 00:55:41,305
No.

578
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:44,409
I-It -- I was hearing
weird things, man.

579
00:55:44,442 --> 00:55:46,644
There was like --
There were figures

580
00:55:46,677 --> 00:55:48,379
and shadows.

581
00:55:48,413 --> 00:55:51,382
I-I heard
two men fighting or something?

582
00:55:51,416 --> 00:55:54,084
It's --

583
00:55:54,118 --> 00:55:58,088
Look, I-I know
it sounds crazy, okay?

584
00:55:58,122 --> 00:56:01,459
I just --

585
00:56:01,492 --> 00:56:04,495
I'm not
a mountain man.

586
00:56:07,598 --> 00:56:10,100
Thank God you found me.

587
00:56:10,134 --> 00:56:12,069
That's what
we're here for --

588
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:14,004
You know, to help confused
people find their way.

589
00:56:15,506 --> 00:56:18,108
So, uh...

590
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:22,513
Do you think
your team will be long, or...

591
00:56:22,547 --> 00:56:23,881
Yeah,
they know I'm here.

592
00:56:23,914 --> 00:56:26,150
You know, we keep track
of each other, yeah.

593
00:56:26,183 --> 00:56:29,019
They won't be long.
Don't worry. You'll see.

594
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:31,088
Hey, man, again,
thank you.

595
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:35,560
I just -- I feel much better
having you here.

596
00:56:35,593 --> 00:56:36,927
Really?

597
00:56:36,961 --> 00:56:38,529
Good.

598
00:56:38,563 --> 00:56:40,565
That's the way
it should be.

599
00:56:42,467 --> 00:56:45,703
Here, hold this
for a minute.

600
00:56:45,736 --> 00:56:47,872
I ain't got good reception out here,
so I'm gonna walk

601
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:49,874
over here and use this, but, uh,
I need you to stay put.

602
00:56:49,907 --> 00:56:52,910
Where am I gonna go?

603
00:56:52,943 --> 00:56:56,013
Ah, I hear you there.
Stay put.

604
00:56:56,046 --> 00:56:58,115
Yeah.

605
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:19,970
Hey, come on!

606
00:57:20,004 --> 00:57:21,772
Where'd you go?!

607
00:57:28,613 --> 00:57:30,481
Oh, no. No.

608
00:57:59,076 --> 00:58:01,679
I can't do this in the dark!

609
00:58:18,663 --> 00:58:19,797
Hello?

610
00:58:21,866 --> 00:58:23,768
Hello?

611
00:58:36,113 --> 00:58:38,749
Stop.

612
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:45,856
Please, just stop.

613
00:59:36,173 --> 00:59:38,375
Get back here.
Don't make me hunt you down.

614
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,310
You gonna shoot me?

615
00:59:40,344 --> 00:59:41,746
I just want to find out

616
00:59:41,779 --> 00:59:44,181
who was peekin'
in the flap of my tent.

617
00:59:47,184 --> 00:59:48,786
Who are you?

618
00:59:48,819 --> 00:59:50,755
Who am I?

619
00:59:50,788 --> 00:59:54,792
What's more important is,
"Who are you?"

620
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:57,261
It doesn't matter
who I am.

621
00:59:57,294 --> 00:59:59,229
Oh, I beg to differ
with you, young man.

622
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:00,397
If you don't tell me,

623
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,132
I'm gonna get Mordecai
to run you off

624
01:00:02,166 --> 01:00:04,635
'and make sure you never
come back here again,

625
01:00:04,669 --> 01:00:06,904
and I can go back inside
to my nice, warm abode

626
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:10,307
and continue having
a quiet evening.

627
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,209
Mordecai your gun?

628
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:19,850
Now what kind
of moron names his gun?

629
01:00:19,884 --> 01:00:22,019
Mordecai.

630
01:00:22,052 --> 01:00:24,922
M-Mordecai's that dog?

631
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:27,725
Well, he ain't my kin.

632
01:00:27,758 --> 01:00:29,827
Look, son, I'm freezing
my tail off out here.

633
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:32,830
Either we can go inside
and continue this discussion,

634
01:00:32,863 --> 01:00:35,700
or you can go back
to where you come from

635
01:00:35,733 --> 01:00:38,903
and, uh, we'll call it
a night.

636
01:00:38,936 --> 01:00:40,771
Come on in.

637
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:46,877
My name's Gabe.

638
01:00:46,911 --> 01:00:49,179
You look like you've seen
better days.

639
01:00:49,213 --> 01:00:51,081
Yeah, so do you.

640
01:00:51,115 --> 01:00:53,884
You want something
to drink?

641
01:00:53,918 --> 01:00:55,686
Uh, whiskey.

642
01:00:55,720 --> 01:01:00,224
I have, uh, coffee.

643
01:01:00,257 --> 01:01:01,358
Bet you're hungry,
too, huh?

644
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:03,460
Yeah, I'm starving.

645
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:06,063
Well, I do have
some, uh, chicken.

646
01:01:06,096 --> 01:01:07,698
You have chicken?

647
01:01:09,867 --> 01:01:12,669
It's over there
in a cooler.

648
01:01:19,076 --> 01:01:20,377
Sorry it's not warm.

649
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:22,880
I am not one
to complain.

650
01:01:22,913 --> 01:01:24,882
So you say.

651
01:01:30,788 --> 01:01:34,859
I see
it's to your liking.

652
01:01:34,892 --> 01:01:36,794
Mm-hmm.

653
01:01:36,827 --> 01:01:39,797
So, what brings you
to my neck of the woods?

654
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,770
I crashed my truck.

655
01:01:45,803 --> 01:01:47,872
Mm-hmm.

656
01:01:47,905 --> 01:01:49,039
What?

657
01:01:49,073 --> 01:01:52,509
Well, why didn't you stay put
until somebody rescued you?

658
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:55,145
My head was spinning.
Everything was fuzzy.

659
01:01:55,179 --> 01:01:58,282
I just --
I-I got confused.

660
01:01:58,315 --> 01:02:00,951
Oh, yeah.

661
01:02:00,985 --> 01:02:01,786
Yeah, that happens.

662
01:02:01,819 --> 01:02:03,420
Look, do other people
live up here,

663
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:07,291
other, uh,
forest people?

664
01:02:07,324 --> 01:02:09,459
"Forest people"?

665
01:02:09,493 --> 01:02:11,495
You mean like...

666
01:02:11,528 --> 01:02:15,032
little people
with colored overalls

667
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:17,835
and tall, pointy hats?

668
01:02:17,868 --> 01:02:20,905
No, I mean are there
other people up here

669
01:02:20,938 --> 01:02:21,872
besides you?

670
01:02:21,906 --> 01:02:27,845
Nope, just me and Mordecai.
That's about it.

671
01:02:27,878 --> 01:02:29,213
Why?

672
01:02:29,246 --> 01:02:31,348
Have you seen
any of these little, uh,

673
01:02:31,381 --> 01:02:33,217
forest people?

674
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:36,353
No, no, but --

675
01:02:37,988 --> 01:02:39,957
Never mind.

676
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:42,026
Actually, I have seen
a few strange things

677
01:02:42,059 --> 01:02:43,393
in these woods.

678
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:45,095
Like what?

679
01:02:45,129 --> 01:02:49,533
A grown men wandering aimlessly
for days on end,

680
01:02:49,566 --> 01:02:53,470
calling from the rapid beat
of his own heart,

681
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:56,974
brash
from the raven's cry,

682
01:02:57,007 --> 01:03:01,411
furious, self-destructive
as a grizzly,

683
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:05,515
all the while acting like
he's been raised by wolves.

684
01:03:05,549 --> 01:03:08,252
Strange things --

685
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:10,921
strange things, Eli.

686
01:03:10,955 --> 01:03:16,827
Yeah, well, now I see why
you don't have any guests.

687
01:03:19,496 --> 01:03:22,366
You have to admit...

688
01:03:22,399 --> 01:03:24,034
I had you going there
for a spell.

689
01:03:24,068 --> 01:03:25,402
You know what? No.

690
01:03:25,435 --> 01:03:26,971
I don't have
to admit anything.

691
01:03:27,004 --> 01:03:28,438
Aha!

692
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:32,342
That's your trouble --
not admitting.

693
01:03:32,376 --> 01:03:33,978
You don't know me.

694
01:03:34,011 --> 01:03:37,514
You don't know anything
about me or my life story.

695
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:40,184
So enlighten me.

696
01:03:40,217 --> 01:03:41,518
No.

697
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:45,122
I-I don't owe you anything,
old man.

698
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:46,891
Come with me.

699
01:03:46,924 --> 01:03:48,926
W-what? No.
Why would I do that?

700
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:51,896
Are you always
so obstinate?

701
01:03:51,929 --> 01:03:55,933
You're a guest in my tent.
You've eaten my food.

702
01:03:55,966 --> 01:03:58,969
And if you want to enjoy
the warmth of my fire,

703
01:03:59,003 --> 01:04:01,838
you'll help an old man get
some more wood.

704
01:04:05,142 --> 01:04:07,011
Well?

705
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:15,619
So, you have
a family?

706
01:04:15,652 --> 01:04:17,121
Yeah.

707
01:04:17,154 --> 01:04:19,023
Kind of.

708
01:04:19,056 --> 01:04:24,261
You, uh, "kind of" have
a family?

709
01:04:24,294 --> 01:04:27,531
Yeah.

710
01:04:27,564 --> 01:04:30,000
I've got a girlfriend

711
01:04:30,034 --> 01:04:31,535
and a daughter.

712
01:04:31,568 --> 01:04:33,670
So you have people
who care about you?

713
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:35,439
They'll be looking
for you.

714
01:04:35,472 --> 01:04:39,409
Nobody knows I'm lost.

715
01:04:39,443 --> 01:04:43,313
I've been, uh --

716
01:04:43,347 --> 01:04:46,917
I've disappeared
before.

717
01:04:46,951 --> 01:04:49,286
So, no.

718
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:51,455
Nobody's looking
for me.

719
01:04:51,488 --> 01:04:55,359
Oh, I disagree.

720
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:59,629
It sounds like you've been lost
even longer than you think.

721
01:04:59,663 --> 01:05:02,166
Hand me
that piece of wood there.

722
01:05:08,172 --> 01:05:10,474
Nice.

723
01:05:10,507 --> 01:05:12,576
Bring the rest.

724
01:05:15,345 --> 01:05:17,214
Well?

725
01:05:31,495 --> 01:05:33,497
Could I ask you
a question?

726
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:34,664
Fire away.

727
01:05:34,698 --> 01:05:37,701
"Fire away."

728
01:05:37,734 --> 01:05:41,105
That's a good one.

729
01:05:41,138 --> 01:05:43,974
Why haven't you asked me
the way out yet?

730
01:05:44,008 --> 01:05:45,109
What?

731
01:05:45,142 --> 01:05:46,676
You're lost,

732
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:50,414
and you haven't asked me
the way out of these woods.

733
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:53,383
I have, uh--
I have this map.

734
01:05:53,417 --> 01:05:55,552
You have a map
of these woods?

735
01:05:55,585 --> 01:05:57,521
Yeah, it's this right here.

736
01:05:57,554 --> 01:05:58,655
If I leave in the morning,

737
01:05:58,688 --> 01:06:00,724
I can find my own way
out of here.

738
01:06:07,031 --> 01:06:10,400
Not with this, you won't.
Who gave you this map?

739
01:06:10,434 --> 01:06:12,536
The, uh --
the park ranger.

740
01:06:12,569 --> 01:06:14,538
"The park ranger" --
Here?

741
01:06:14,571 --> 01:06:16,673
Yeah, he was --
He was looking for me.

742
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:19,643
I'm sure he was.

743
01:06:19,676 --> 01:06:22,546
Well, he disappeared.

744
01:06:22,579 --> 01:06:25,015
Look, man, it doesn't
matter what I say.

745
01:06:25,049 --> 01:06:27,417
Anything I tell you, it's just
gonna make me sound crazy.

746
01:06:27,451 --> 01:06:31,321
So can we just drop it?

747
01:06:31,355 --> 01:06:34,224
If you'd like.

748
01:06:34,258 --> 01:06:37,227
Why don't you tell me
about your daughter?

749
01:06:37,261 --> 01:06:38,462
My daughter?

750
01:06:38,495 --> 01:06:40,064
Yeah.

751
01:06:40,097 --> 01:06:43,167
It's been a long time since
I've been around little ones.

752
01:06:45,302 --> 01:06:47,337
What's she like?

753
01:06:48,705 --> 01:06:51,108
She's amazing.

754
01:06:51,141 --> 01:06:54,144
She just turned 4
a few months ago,

755
01:06:54,178 --> 01:06:57,181
and we might be putting her
in preschool soon.

756
01:06:57,214 --> 01:06:59,483
I think.
I-I don't really --

757
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:03,453
I don't know, 'cause I don't
really make those decisions.

758
01:07:03,487 --> 01:07:05,055
What's her name?

759
01:07:05,089 --> 01:07:06,323
Hannah.

760
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,658
"Hannah-Banana,"
That's what I call her...

761
01:07:08,692 --> 01:07:10,494
yeah, if, um --

762
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:13,063
if I tuck her in
at night.

763
01:07:13,097 --> 01:07:16,166
"If?" Why?
You work late, or...

764
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,468
Nope.

765
01:07:18,502 --> 01:07:21,138
I'm jobless.

766
01:07:21,171 --> 01:07:22,772
Well, I'd say raising
a little one's

767
01:07:22,806 --> 01:07:26,076
a pretty important job.

768
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:27,077
Yeah.

769
01:07:27,111 --> 01:07:32,182
Yeah, yeah, I guess --
I guess you're right.

770
01:07:32,216 --> 01:07:34,684
You know, I...

771
01:07:34,718 --> 01:07:36,620
I don't know why I'm telling you
all this stuff.

772
01:07:36,653 --> 01:07:39,389
I don't even know
what I'm doing here.

773
01:07:39,423 --> 01:07:41,358
You're right.
You don't.

774
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:45,229
That's what got you here
in the first place.

775
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:49,766
Yeah, I guess
you're right.

776
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:54,238
So, tell me more
about, uh... Hannah.

777
01:07:54,271 --> 01:07:55,839
What else
do you want me to say?

778
01:07:55,872 --> 01:07:59,243
That I'm not around
to tuck her in at night or...

779
01:07:59,276 --> 01:08:00,810
watch her paint
her paintings

780
01:08:00,844 --> 01:08:02,646
or when she wants
to dress up,

781
01:08:02,679 --> 01:08:05,182
or that I'm just
this deadbeat,

782
01:08:05,215 --> 01:08:08,785
jobless dad
w-who cares more about

783
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:10,687
spending time at the bar
and watching football

784
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:11,821
than taking care
of his family?

785
01:08:11,855 --> 01:08:14,124
Is that
what you want to hear?

786
01:08:14,158 --> 01:08:17,561
Hey, just consider me
your sounding board.

787
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:20,264
Right.

788
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:25,135
So, are you churchgoers?

789
01:08:27,471 --> 01:08:28,572
Yeah.

790
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:31,541
They go.

791
01:08:31,575 --> 01:08:33,510
But not you?

792
01:08:33,543 --> 01:08:36,680
You know what, man?
I don't think this is any of your business.

793
01:08:36,713 --> 01:08:39,683
You know, frankly,
you're right.

794
01:08:39,716 --> 01:08:42,919
Everything you told me is
none of my business,

795
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:44,821
but it just seems
like you, uh,

796
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:47,191
need to get a few things
off your chest.

797
01:08:57,534 --> 01:09:00,304
Come on, Mordecai.

798
01:09:04,908 --> 01:09:06,876
Hey,
you're still here.

799
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:12,349
God hasn't been a part
of my life for a long time.

800
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:16,853
So I figure...

801
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:18,822
why involve Him now?

802
01:09:21,725 --> 01:09:23,960
You think that's funny?

803
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,862
I don't need
a man-made map

804
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:28,798
for this
ever-changing wilderness,

805
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:31,301
and neither do you, Eli.

806
01:09:31,335 --> 01:09:34,304
It was you, wasn't it?
You did this.

807
01:09:34,338 --> 01:09:37,241
Y-You're the one who's been
keeping my fire going

808
01:09:37,274 --> 01:09:39,743
and got me all turned around
in the woods.

809
01:09:39,776 --> 01:09:41,745
No.
Open your eyes, son.

810
01:09:41,778 --> 01:09:43,513
There's a lot more
going on here than --

811
01:09:43,547 --> 01:09:45,882
No, you open your eyes,
old man!

812
01:09:45,915 --> 01:09:47,951
It's my life, okay?

813
01:09:47,984 --> 01:09:49,419
I'm in charge of my life.

814
01:09:49,453 --> 01:09:51,955
I control my destiny,
no one else -- me.

815
01:09:51,988 --> 01:09:54,424
You got it?
- Oh, I got it.

816
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:57,494
I get
that you're not getting it.

817
01:09:57,527 --> 01:09:58,695
But it'll happen.

818
01:09:58,728 --> 01:10:01,331
It'll happen
when you're ready.

819
01:10:01,365 --> 01:10:02,699
What'll happen?

820
01:10:02,732 --> 01:10:04,968
You gonna do something?

821
01:10:05,001 --> 01:10:09,005
It's hard to understand
but, trust me, it will happen.

822
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:12,476
No, I-I don't have
to trust you.

823
01:10:12,509 --> 01:10:14,744
If you don't trust me,

824
01:10:14,778 --> 01:10:17,581
trust God.

825
01:10:17,614 --> 01:10:19,983
He's looking
after you.

826
01:10:20,016 --> 01:10:23,253
There's a battle going on
for you

827
01:10:23,287 --> 01:10:26,456
that's even bigger
than you can believe.

828
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:27,691
Stop it.

829
01:10:30,827 --> 01:10:33,763
Ohh.

830
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,935
I feel like
I'm going crazy.

831
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:42,806
That's what happens.
It's all part of the process.

832
01:10:45,742 --> 01:10:46,943
I'm sorry.

833
01:10:46,976 --> 01:10:48,945
No apology needed.

834
01:10:50,847 --> 01:10:52,882
May I pray for you?

835
01:10:54,718 --> 01:10:58,422
Y-You want to pray
for me?

836
01:10:58,455 --> 01:10:59,756
Are you serious?

837
01:10:59,789 --> 01:11:01,825
If you'll allow it.

838
01:11:05,895 --> 01:11:10,967
All right, um, just --
just don't expect me

839
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,736
to do any of that...

840
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,538
praying-after-you...

841
01:11:14,571 --> 01:11:16,806
whatever stuff, okay?

842
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,875
Of course.

843
01:11:24,881 --> 01:11:28,452
Heavenly Father,

844
01:11:28,485 --> 01:11:30,454
I'm with Eli.

845
01:11:30,487 --> 01:11:32,889
He's suffered
in these woods.

846
01:11:34,524 --> 01:11:37,827
I pray to you, God,
that you will heal him.

847
01:11:37,861 --> 01:11:41,365
Lead him out of this wilderness
and back home to his family,

848
01:11:41,398 --> 01:11:44,734
who need him
and love him.

849
01:11:48,104 --> 01:11:54,778
I ask this, that you warm him
in Your love.

850
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:58,748
I pray this
in Jesus' name.

851
01:11:58,782 --> 01:12:00,650
Amen.

852
01:12:02,919 --> 01:12:04,588
Amen.

853
01:12:04,621 --> 01:12:07,591
Come on inside.
I'll get you some blankets.

854
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:37,954
No.

855
01:12:37,987 --> 01:12:41,425
No, this isn't happening.

856
01:12:41,458 --> 01:12:44,928
No, this isn't happening.

857
01:12:44,961 --> 01:12:46,530
I didn't dream this.

858
01:12:46,563 --> 01:12:48,965
I didn't dream it!

859
01:12:48,998 --> 01:12:51,568
Come on!
Hello?!

860
01:12:52,836 --> 01:12:56,806
Gabe!

861
01:12:56,840 --> 01:13:00,644
Mordecai!

862
01:14:01,104 --> 01:14:03,607
I can't --
I can't believe it.

863
01:14:06,576 --> 01:14:08,177
What's going on?

864
01:14:16,586 --> 01:14:18,955
Okay!

865
01:14:18,988 --> 01:14:21,024
Okay, God,
if this is really you,

866
01:14:21,057 --> 01:14:22,158
let me see you.

867
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:26,029
Come on!
Show yourself!

868
01:14:26,062 --> 01:14:29,733
Big, mighty, powerful Jesus!
Come on!

869
01:14:30,634 --> 01:14:33,069
You want me
to believe you're real,

870
01:14:33,102 --> 01:14:35,038
show me something!

871
01:14:35,071 --> 01:14:37,807
Come on, give me fire
right now!

872
01:14:37,841 --> 01:14:39,042
Come on!

873
01:14:39,075 --> 01:14:41,177
Do it again!

874
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:43,980
Give me food, give me shelter,
give me something!

875
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:48,952
Yeah, I knew it!

876
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:50,687
I knew it wasn't you!

877
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:55,625
I mean, why would you want
to help me, huh?

878
01:14:55,659 --> 01:14:56,860
I mean, me!

879
01:14:56,893 --> 01:14:58,862
Is this punishment, torture?

880
01:14:58,895 --> 01:15:01,064
What, you want me
to die out here,

881
01:15:01,097 --> 01:15:03,099
freeze to death?

882
01:15:07,971 --> 01:15:12,208
My little girl back at home
not knowing that I was sorry --

883
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:17,714
I'm not supposed
to die out here.

884
01:15:20,884 --> 01:15:23,820
What
about the calling of my life?

885
01:15:27,123 --> 01:15:28,825
What about your calling?

886
01:15:34,731 --> 01:15:36,800
God, please...

887
01:15:36,833 --> 01:15:40,236
don't let me die, not now.

888
01:15:40,269 --> 01:15:42,639
I put my trust in you.

889
01:15:44,741 --> 01:15:46,610
Please help me.

890
01:15:50,747 --> 01:15:52,649
I need you.

891
01:16:25,749 --> 01:16:30,053
Hey, buddy,
are you okay?

892
01:17:00,383 --> 01:17:02,351
- Daddy!
- Hey, Banana.

893
01:17:02,385 --> 01:17:05,689
Come here, baby.
Ohh.

894
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:09,893
Hannah,
go to your room.

895
01:17:09,926 --> 01:17:12,896
But I want to see Daddy.
Hannah. No, that's okay.

896
01:17:12,929 --> 01:17:15,699
Do what your mom says.
Go on. Go.

897
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:23,673
What are you doing?

898
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:27,744
Listen, um, I know --
I know that --

899
01:17:27,777 --> 01:17:32,081
"Know" -- Eli,
you don't know anything.

900
01:17:32,115 --> 01:17:33,817
You don't know
how hard it is

901
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:37,353
to tell my 4-year-old daughter
why her daddy disappears

902
01:17:37,386 --> 01:17:39,055
and doesn't show up
for a week.

903
01:17:39,088 --> 01:17:41,390
You don't know.

904
01:17:44,427 --> 01:17:47,030
No, um...

905
01:17:47,063 --> 01:17:49,398
you're right.

906
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:56,740
Where were you?

907
01:17:57,073 --> 01:18:00,209
Um...

908
01:18:00,243 --> 01:18:03,312
That's all you have
for me -- nothing?

909
01:18:03,346 --> 01:18:05,281
I don't have
any excuses.

910
01:18:05,314 --> 01:18:08,051
No more, um --

911
01:18:08,084 --> 01:18:09,485
I don't have
any justification,

912
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:12,355
no more --
no more lies.

913
01:18:12,388 --> 01:18:14,423
This time was different.

914
01:18:14,457 --> 01:18:17,994
I wish I could undo
all the -- all the lies

915
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:20,096
and convince you
that -- that I've changed,

916
01:18:20,129 --> 01:18:22,766
but, um...

917
01:18:25,234 --> 01:18:28,137
I just wish
you could believe me.

918
01:18:28,171 --> 01:18:31,340
I do, but I understand
if you can't.

919
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:36,012
The other night, um...

920
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:38,514
I left the bar, and I-I drove
into the mountains.

921
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:43,787
And, um, I crashed my truck
into the woods, and I got lost.

922
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:47,056
And that's where
I've been ever since.

923
01:18:50,326 --> 01:18:54,363
I don't want
to fight anymore, okay?

924
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:59,402
You're right.
I-I'm a horrible father.

925
01:18:59,435 --> 01:19:03,472
I'm a horrible boyfriend.

926
01:19:03,506 --> 01:19:07,243
I don't expect you
to believe me.

927
01:19:07,276 --> 01:19:10,179
But, Ganeen,
I'm different.

928
01:19:12,348 --> 01:19:15,018
I can't even explain it
to myself.

929
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:46,115
Try me.

930
01:19:46,382 --> 01:19:48,317
Really?

931
01:19:48,351 --> 01:19:49,485
Really.

932
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:52,121
This is all very...

933
01:19:52,155 --> 01:19:53,857
un-Eli-ish of you.

934
01:19:55,024 --> 01:19:57,493
It is un-Eli-ish,
isn't it?

935
01:20:05,068 --> 01:20:06,369
I think it's God.

936
01:20:10,273 --> 01:20:12,141
God?

937
01:20:14,978 --> 01:20:17,480
Eli...

938
01:20:17,513 --> 01:20:20,383
what happened to you?

939
01:20:20,416 --> 01:20:22,585
I-I don't know.

940
01:20:22,618 --> 01:20:27,390
It was some kind
of, um...

941
01:20:27,423 --> 01:20:29,425
like a battle.

942
01:20:32,061 --> 01:20:35,398
I never --
I never told you --

943
01:20:35,431 --> 01:20:38,267
Well, I never told
anybody this.

944
01:20:38,301 --> 01:20:40,303
Um...

945
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:42,138
There was this one week
when I was 10.

946
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:46,609
My parents dropped me off
at my Grandma Meredith's place.

947
01:20:46,642 --> 01:20:50,346
She always believed in me
when no one else would,

948
01:20:50,379 --> 01:20:52,015
you know?

949
01:20:52,048 --> 01:20:54,350
She told me
that she had been fasting

950
01:20:54,383 --> 01:20:57,586
a-and praying for me.

951
01:20:57,620 --> 01:20:59,622
She believed
I had a calling,

952
01:20:59,655 --> 01:21:02,058
a great purpose
in life.

953
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:08,197
A few years later,
she died.

954
01:21:08,231 --> 01:21:11,400
I was, uh...

955
01:21:11,434 --> 01:21:13,036
I was, uh --

956
01:21:13,069 --> 01:21:16,305
W-what kind of God
would take someone like that

957
01:21:16,339 --> 01:21:17,606
away from you?

958
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:26,649
I guess...

959
01:21:26,682 --> 01:21:31,620
I guess
I've just been, uh...

960
01:21:31,654 --> 01:21:35,091
running ever since,
hiding,

961
01:21:35,124 --> 01:21:39,963
just fighting,
you know, until now.

962
01:21:46,702 --> 01:21:49,505
I was h-- I was hoping
you would pray with me.

963
01:21:52,175 --> 01:21:53,476
You want to pray?

964
01:21:53,509 --> 01:21:57,113
- Mm-hmm.
- With me?

965
01:21:57,146 --> 01:21:59,015
Please.

966
01:22:14,530 --> 01:22:16,499
Um...

967
01:22:16,532 --> 01:22:18,667
Hey, God.

968
01:22:18,701 --> 01:22:21,604
It's, uh --
It's been a while.

969
01:22:24,107 --> 01:22:26,009
And, uh...

970
01:22:26,042 --> 01:22:30,213
Well
a lot's happened.

971
01:22:30,246 --> 01:22:32,115
And, uh...

972
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:37,253
I can see
that it was you, Lord.

973
01:22:37,286 --> 01:22:41,157
I can see that it was you
in everything.

974
01:22:43,492 --> 01:22:45,728
And, um...

975
01:22:45,761 --> 01:22:48,397
I know you have
a lot more to teach me,

976
01:22:48,431 --> 01:22:53,069
and, Lord,
please help me.

977
01:22:53,102 --> 01:22:55,704
Help me to do right
by Ganeen.

978
01:22:58,174 --> 01:23:00,543
And, uh, help us
to be better,

979
01:23:00,576 --> 01:23:01,710
to live with honor

980
01:23:01,744 --> 01:23:05,648
and, um, to not hurt
each other or you.

981
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:13,556
Please, Lord.

982
01:23:13,589 --> 01:23:16,559
In the name of Jesus...

983
01:23:16,592 --> 01:23:18,627
amen.

984
01:23:47,623 --> 01:23:49,525
Wow.

985
01:23:49,558 --> 01:23:53,462
It's been a long time
since I was in Sunday school.

986
01:23:53,496 --> 01:23:55,464
You guys seem really smart.

987
01:23:55,498 --> 01:23:57,600
I'm a little nervous.

988
01:23:57,633 --> 01:23:59,168
Yeah.

989
01:23:59,202 --> 01:24:01,437
But it's good.
It's good.

990
01:24:01,470 --> 01:24:02,705
It's good that you're here.

991
01:24:02,738 --> 01:24:05,108
Who knows my daughter, Hannah?

992
01:24:05,141 --> 01:24:07,576
All of you?
Good.

993
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:09,212
Did you know
that she prays for me.

994
01:24:09,245 --> 01:24:11,480
Did she tell you that?
Did she talk about it at all?

995
01:24:11,514 --> 01:24:13,849
You know, she prays a lot.

996
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:15,351
How many of you, uh --

997
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:20,089
How many of you kids
pray for your parents?

998
01:24:20,123 --> 01:24:22,258
That's good.
That's important.

999
01:24:22,291 --> 01:24:24,160
Um...

1000
01:24:24,193 --> 01:24:26,229
We need it.

1001
01:24:26,262 --> 01:24:28,697
It makes -- It makes
a lot of difference.

1002
01:24:28,731 --> 01:24:31,800
Yeah, um, did Hannah
ever tell you guys

1003
01:24:31,834 --> 01:24:35,771
about the time
I was lost in the forest?

1004
01:24:36,439 --> 01:24:37,606
What?

1005
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:39,508
How lost were you?

1006
01:24:39,542 --> 01:24:43,646
I was so lost --

1007
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:45,481
for days --

1008
01:24:45,514 --> 01:24:48,151
that everywhere I turned

1009
01:24:48,184 --> 01:24:50,486
just lead me right back
into the forest.

1010
01:24:50,519 --> 01:24:52,221
I couldn't find my way out.

1011
01:24:52,255 --> 01:24:53,856
I was so lost.

1012
01:24:53,889 --> 01:24:57,126
I was certain I was never gonna
get out of that wood.

1013
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:58,494
You guys ever have
to go to your room

1014
01:24:58,527 --> 01:25:01,797
because you didn't listen
or, like, you didn't do

1015
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:03,466
something you were told, yeah?

1016
01:25:03,499 --> 01:25:07,303
That was -- That was kind of
what happened in the forest.

1017
01:25:07,336 --> 01:25:08,871
Um...

1018
01:25:08,904 --> 01:25:12,541
God, when he wants us
to listen,

1019
01:25:12,575 --> 01:25:13,876
sometimes he has
to do something

1020
01:25:13,909 --> 01:25:18,614
to pull us aside and say,
"Hey, pay attention."

1021
01:25:18,647 --> 01:25:20,916
But, you know,

1022
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:23,486
God doesn't stop there.

1023
01:25:23,519 --> 01:25:29,825
The Bible says that Jesus
then equips us to --

1024
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:31,794
to do good works,

1025
01:25:31,827 --> 01:25:35,264
to do what we were
always meant to do.

1026
01:25:35,298 --> 01:25:36,365
Yeah.

1027
01:25:36,399 --> 01:25:38,301
My grandma told me that.

1028
01:25:38,334 --> 01:25:41,870
She always used
to tell me that and a lot more.

1029
01:25:41,904 --> 01:25:44,707
When your heart is
in the right place,

1030
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:47,210
get ready.

1031
01:25:47,243 --> 01:25:50,313
Some amazing things will happen.

1032
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:55,718
Are you ready?
