1
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:05,770
I'm Michele
from Davis, California,

2
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:07,372
and I am a professional baker.

3
00:00:07,373 --> 00:00:09,283
I'm Percy from Oak Ridge,
New Jersey,

4
00:00:09,284 --> 00:00:11,705
and I am a professional baker.

5
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:14,312
I'm Jennifer
from Los Angeles, California,

6
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:17,082
and I am a professional baker.

7
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,123
I'm Henry from Alameda,
California,

8
00:00:19,124 --> 00:00:22,688
and I am a professional baker.

9
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:25,324
Hang on! The fun
is about to begin.

10
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:27,325
Four bakers are here
to do battle.

11
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:29,795
Golden-brown delicious.

12
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:31,796
Two are amazing amateurs.

13
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:33,165
Do I look like I need help?

14
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,096
Hey, have you got an
Easy-Bake Oven down there?

15
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:36,371
And two are professionals.

16
00:00:36,372 --> 00:00:38,299
Lovely.
Out of this world.

17
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:40,973
But only they know
their true identities.

18
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:42,975
Their mission?

19
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:43,906
Just winnin' a bunch of money.

20
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,410
Outbake the competition.

21
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:47,311
If a professional baker wins,

22
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:49,214
they take home $10,000.

23
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,615
That sounds fancy.

24
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:52,685
But if an amateur is able
to fake out the judges...

25
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:53,916
I didn't wanna stop eating it.

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,254
You're a baker.

27
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,655
...and take down the pros...
- Pssh! Pssh!

28
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:59,187
...they walk away
with 15 grand!

29
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:00,766
Wow!

30
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:02,097
Bada-bing, bada-boom.

31
00:01:02,102 --> 00:01:03,902
Are you a baker

32
00:01:03,904 --> 00:01:05,938
or a faker?

33
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:07,507
- I...
- Am...

34
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:08,807
A...

35
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,910
What?!

36
00:01:12,913 --> 00:01:14,780
- What?!
- No way!

37
00:01:14,781 --> 00:01:16,649
I don't believe it!

38
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,850
Welcome to
"Bakers Vs. Fakers."

39
00:01:20,854 --> 00:01:22,360
- Whoo!
- Let's do this.

40
00:01:22,361 --> 00:01:24,485
There are two rounds
of competition here.

41
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:28,560
In Round 1, it's my choice.

42
00:01:28,562 --> 00:01:29,629
Uh-oh.

43
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,770
Today, you're going to be
baking...

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,935
...cheesecake.

45
00:01:35,936 --> 00:01:39,204
Nice.

46
00:01:39,205 --> 00:01:40,465
I love cheesecake.

47
00:01:40,473 --> 00:01:42,842
Hmm.

48
00:01:42,843 --> 00:01:44,383
Cheesecake definitely takes
a lot longer

49
00:01:44,384 --> 00:01:45,907
to cook than your regular cake

50
00:01:45,912 --> 00:01:49,649
and kind of have to be careful
in the timing of it.

51
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:52,450
Even a home baker
can make a decent cheesecake.

52
00:01:52,452 --> 00:01:55,387
But it takes a real pro

53
00:01:55,388 --> 00:01:59,228
to make a cheesecake using...

54
00:02:01,234 --> 00:02:03,268
...popcorn.

55
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:05,938
- Popcorn?
- Yeah.

56
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:07,308
Are we going to a movie or what?

57
00:02:07,309 --> 00:02:09,207
Popcorn?
Popcorn in cheesecake?

58
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:10,639
I got to make this work.

59
00:02:10,644 --> 00:02:12,612
We have buttered popcorn,

60
00:02:12,613 --> 00:02:16,815
cheddar popcorn, chili popcorn.

61
00:02:16,816 --> 00:02:18,116
<i>Caliente.</i>

62
00:02:18,117 --> 00:02:19,585
Whoo!

63
00:02:19,586 --> 00:02:21,554
Bacon popcorn...

64
00:02:21,555 --> 00:02:22,985
That's the one right there.

65
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:25,625
...and unpopped popcorn.

66
00:02:25,626 --> 00:02:27,886
You've got 45 minutes
on the clock.

67
00:02:27,894 --> 00:02:29,204
You ready?
- Ready!

68
00:02:29,205 --> 00:02:31,025
- You sure?
- Absolutely!

69
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:33,431
Okay.
Get baking!

70
00:02:35,736 --> 00:02:37,096
Behind you.

71
00:02:37,103 --> 00:02:40,172
All right, guys.
Popcorn in cheesecake.

72
00:02:40,173 --> 00:02:41,783
If you did
a New York-style cheesecake

73
00:02:41,784 --> 00:02:43,035
with a lot of cream cheese

74
00:02:43,043 --> 00:02:44,781
as a good support system
with eggs,

75
00:02:44,782 --> 00:02:47,508
let it hang out while
you figure out the popcorn,

76
00:02:47,514 --> 00:02:49,684
you could get somewhere
with that, I think.

77
00:02:49,685 --> 00:02:51,283
There's definitely
technique to it,

78
00:02:51,284 --> 00:02:53,390
but it's also kind
of an easy dessert.

79
00:02:53,391 --> 00:02:55,555
I feel like a baker
would maybe hug the shoreline

80
00:02:55,556 --> 00:02:58,726
a little bit more and let
the cheesecake really shine.

81
00:02:58,727 --> 00:03:00,155
Are you saying bakers are safe?

82
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,500
- Yeah.
- Come on.

83
00:03:01,502 --> 00:03:04,537
I live on the wild side.
Oh, my God.

84
00:03:04,538 --> 00:03:07,538
I mean, to me, you're baking
cheesecake in 45 minutes,

85
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:10,379
they have to bake it
at a higher-temperature oven.

86
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,645
I mean, you could make
a no-bake cheesecake.

87
00:03:12,646 --> 00:03:13,746
All right.

88
00:03:13,747 --> 00:03:16,616
What would a baker
do with popcorn?

89
00:03:16,617 --> 00:03:19,347
With popcorn, it's all about
the aromatherapy.

90
00:03:19,352 --> 00:03:21,222
I want to feel like
I'm in a movie theater.

91
00:03:21,223 --> 00:03:23,856
Maybe a pro will
pop fresh popcorn

92
00:03:23,857 --> 00:03:25,557
and make caramel corn.

93
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:28,129
It's going to take
a real baker to figure out

94
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,228
how to get that real
popcorn essence and flavor

95
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:33,370
and not give us a mushy,
disgusting mess.

96
00:03:37,604 --> 00:03:40,405
Stay.

97
00:03:40,406 --> 00:03:43,506
I kind of describe myself
as a little bit a-dork-able.

98
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,380
I'm generally just kind of silly

99
00:03:45,381 --> 00:03:47,878
and try to have fun with things.

100
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:48,981
Let's see.

101
00:03:48,982 --> 00:03:51,150
My personality gets reflected

102
00:03:51,151 --> 00:03:52,985
in my baking style.

103
00:03:52,986 --> 00:03:55,886
I like to try to do something
a little different

104
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:57,957
in how something's presented.

105
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:01,198
I like to have fun
with the things that I do.

106
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:03,068
There we go, baby.

107
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:06,038
I am making a cheesecake parfait

108
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:09,775
with a bacon popcorn shortbread

109
00:04:09,776 --> 00:04:11,476
and caramel bacon sauce.

110
00:04:11,477 --> 00:04:13,477
So the first thing
I'm going to do

111
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:16,215
is start the no-bake cheesecake,

112
00:04:16,216 --> 00:04:18,476
got cream cheese.

113
00:04:18,484 --> 00:04:20,886
I'm doing a no-bake cheesecake

114
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:22,787
because I don't have to worry

115
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:25,359
about the possibility of it
not setting up.

116
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,388
I know it's a safe bet.

117
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:30,332
I add cream cheese
and a little lemon juice.

118
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,599
Look at Jennifer's kitchen.

119
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,467
She's doing
a non-bake cheesecake,

120
00:04:33,468 --> 00:04:34,696
and I think that's smart.

121
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:36,701
It's such a fast way
to reduce the time

122
00:04:36,703 --> 00:04:38,573
that you need to spend
actually making the custard.

123
00:04:38,574 --> 00:04:42,341
Now, if she's not a baker,
I don't know who is.

124
00:04:42,342 --> 00:04:45,811
Let's get some of that
cheesecake filling in here.

125
00:04:45,812 --> 00:04:49,752
I've been baking since I could
pretty much reach the counter.

126
00:04:49,753 --> 00:04:51,050
I was a fat kid.

127
00:04:51,051 --> 00:04:54,086
I wanted to learn
how to make sweets.

128
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:58,087
I picked up the bag of chocolate
chips and read the recipe,

129
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:00,191
and, you know, I figured it out.

130
00:05:00,193 --> 00:05:03,235
And I've just grown from there.

131
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:05,266
Put you aside.

132
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,040
Oh. Oh, my goodness.

133
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,841
- You all right over there?
- Yeah.

134
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:12,481
Just dropping popcorn,
trying to throw you off.

135
00:05:12,482 --> 00:05:14,378
Even though
I'm a small-town girl,

136
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,716
I go big and bold
with my baking.

137
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:18,317
Let's go here.

138
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,087
I'm using my favorite butter.

139
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:21,586
I started baking just being

140
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,988
in the kitchen
with my grandmother.

141
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,990
She would spend hours with me,

142
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,592
coming up with different recipes

143
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:29,204
that we could enter
in the State Fair.

144
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:31,155
And after that, I was hooked.

145
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,334
It's going.
Churros and caramel corn

146
00:05:33,335 --> 00:05:35,543
always take me
back to my childhood.

147
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:39,705
So today I'm making a cheesecake
with caramel popcorn.

148
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,406
I'm going to use
the buttered popcorn

149
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:43,537
in my graham cracker crust,

150
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:45,954
and then I'm going to use
the unpopped popcorn

151
00:05:45,955 --> 00:05:48,346
to make my caramel popcorn

152
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,378
and then garnish it
with a cinnamon churro.

153
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:52,990
All right.
And the first thing

154
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:55,016
I need to do
is start my churro base.

155
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,856
Churro time.

156
00:05:56,857 --> 00:06:00,287
A churro is a fried pastry dough

157
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,773
rolled in cinnamon and sugar.

158
00:06:01,774 --> 00:06:04,468
As a child,
I would go to the fair,

159
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,570
and you got to have that churro
to walk around with.

160
00:06:07,574 --> 00:06:08,574
All right.

161
00:06:08,575 --> 00:06:10,605
I put the dough into
a piping bag

162
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:13,611
and get over to the hot oil.
Almost there.

163
00:06:13,614 --> 00:06:16,148
Michele's churros
look delicious.

164
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:17,449
Come on, baby.
Come on.

165
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,520
But her churros seemed
very soft to me.

166
00:06:20,521 --> 00:06:23,259
She might have put too
many eggs in the batter.

167
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,686
And when you do a churro,

168
00:06:24,691 --> 00:06:26,961
it's got to be so tough
you can barely

169
00:06:26,962 --> 00:06:28,830
even squeeze it out of the bag.

170
00:06:28,831 --> 00:06:31,396
Michele is a faker.

171
00:06:31,397 --> 00:06:32,797
They're going to be good.

172
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:34,534
Bacon popcorn.

173
00:06:34,535 --> 00:06:36,395
My motto is,
"Never trust a skinny chef."

174
00:06:36,402 --> 00:06:39,042
So I try to follow that,
as you can tell.

175
00:06:39,043 --> 00:06:41,169
Yep, definitely bacon.

176
00:06:41,174 --> 00:06:42,884
I'm going to be making
a maple cheesecake

177
00:06:42,885 --> 00:06:44,806
with a bacon popcorn crust

178
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:47,381
and then garnish it
with a candied bacon.

179
00:06:47,382 --> 00:06:48,650
Who doesn't love bacon, right?

180
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:51,179
My personal baking style
is the balance

181
00:06:51,184 --> 00:06:53,290
that I can create
between two ingredients.

182
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:54,554
So I think I got this.

183
00:06:54,555 --> 00:06:55,685
I'm going to win this
competition.

184
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:56,889
Bring it, buddy.

185
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,090
You don't want my children
to starve, do you?

186
00:06:58,091 --> 00:07:01,231
Family's everything to me.

187
00:07:01,234 --> 00:07:03,340
I wouldn't be where
I'm at today without them.

188
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:05,366
All right.
Baking's definitely my passion,

189
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:07,009
and I feel like
it shows through.

190
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,607
I baked my first cake
when I was 10.

191
00:07:08,609 --> 00:07:10,239
My mom was in
a boating accident,

192
00:07:10,243 --> 00:07:11,944
and when I found
out what happened,

193
00:07:11,945 --> 00:07:13,945
I went into the kitchen and
started looking at her recipes.

194
00:07:13,947 --> 00:07:15,517
I said, "You know what? I'm
going to make a cake for her."

195
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,246
And I've been doing
it ever since.

196
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,650
First thing I need to get
done - make the crust,

197
00:07:19,653 --> 00:07:21,963
grind up the graham cracker
and the bacon popcorn

198
00:07:21,964 --> 00:07:24,115
to add texture to the base.

199
00:07:24,124 --> 00:07:25,394
Figure we'd put it
in the crust to give it

200
00:07:25,395 --> 00:07:27,860
that popcorn flavor.

201
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:29,194
Look at Henry.

202
00:07:29,195 --> 00:07:30,755
He's grinding up
the popcorn, the butter.

203
00:07:30,764 --> 00:07:32,534
He's pressing that down
to make a crust.

204
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,270
It is going to be
crisp and buttery

205
00:07:34,271 --> 00:07:36,867
and perfect, baker move.
- Good, good, good.

206
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,010
Second thing I'm going to do
is the cheesecake batter.

207
00:07:39,011 --> 00:07:41,874
I need to cream the cheese,
then add the maple...

208
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,105
Add the maple syrup.

209
00:07:43,109 --> 00:07:45,678
It's going to add
some sweetness.

210
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:47,179
...and then add the eggs.

211
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,649
I picked two simple ingredients,
maple and bacon,

212
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:50,919
but when they come together,

213
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,117
it becomes this
salty-sweet-tasting cheesecake.

214
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,455
In they go.

215
00:07:56,456 --> 00:07:58,086
The next step - I need to work
on the candied bacon.

216
00:07:58,091 --> 00:07:59,661
I want to make sure
that the maple

217
00:07:59,662 --> 00:08:01,670
and bacon flavors
will definitely shine through.

218
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:03,568
I'm baking with bacon.

219
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,508
The next step -
I brush maple on to the bacon

220
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:08,976
and add some of the crushed
bacon popcorn to add texture.

221
00:08:08,977 --> 00:08:10,675
In the oven it goes.

222
00:08:10,677 --> 00:08:13,677
Henry's got the bacon baking
in the oven at the same time

223
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,948
as the cheesecake...
- Mm-hmm.

224
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:15,948
...could actually infuse
the flavor of the bacon.

225
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:17,349
I was thinking about that,

226
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,520
and a little bit of smoke
in there as well.

227
00:08:18,521 --> 00:08:20,919
It's a definite baker move.

228
00:08:20,921 --> 00:08:22,221
Okay.
Come on, P-Dubs.

229
00:08:22,222 --> 00:08:23,789
Come on, P-Dubs.

230
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,625
I would consider myself
very competitive.

231
00:08:25,626 --> 00:08:27,186
I'm not trying
to be braggadocious here,

232
00:08:27,193 --> 00:08:29,131
but I've been around
the block a few times.

233
00:08:29,132 --> 00:08:30,498
And, you know, these new kids,

234
00:08:30,499 --> 00:08:32,026
I'm not really concerned
about them.

235
00:08:32,032 --> 00:08:34,332
We can do this.
We can do this.

236
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:37,404
My style of baking
is spicy and sweet together.

237
00:08:37,405 --> 00:08:40,940
So today I'm making
a chocolate cheesecake

238
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:43,308
with a chili popcorn crust.

239
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:44,909
Come on, Percy.
Come on.

240
00:08:44,911 --> 00:08:46,381
The first thing I know
I got to do is the crust.

241
00:08:46,382 --> 00:08:47,909
That's going to be the base.

242
00:08:47,914 --> 00:08:49,884
So I've got to grind
the popcorn, melt the butter,

243
00:08:49,885 --> 00:08:51,383
put that into the springform pan

244
00:08:51,384 --> 00:08:53,924
because I have to make
individual servings here.

245
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:56,288
Okay.
I'm parbaking this crust

246
00:08:56,289 --> 00:08:59,029
because I want my crust
to be stiff at the bottom.

247
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,495
Percy is using
a springform or mold

248
00:09:01,502 --> 00:09:03,669
so he can serve the cheesecake

249
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,870
without any walls.

250
00:09:04,871 --> 00:09:06,371
That's a baker.

251
00:09:06,372 --> 00:09:09,111
And he's parbaking his crust
so that it's crispy,

252
00:09:09,112 --> 00:09:10,939
and his popcorn
doesn't get soggy.

253
00:09:10,944 --> 00:09:12,778
Trust me, baker.

254
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:14,309
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

255
00:09:14,314 --> 00:09:17,052
Growing up as a kid,
we enjoyed popcorn in my house.

256
00:09:17,053 --> 00:09:19,785
I was the oldest of 14 children,
so I knew

257
00:09:19,786 --> 00:09:21,346
that if I wanted something
really good,

258
00:09:21,354 --> 00:09:22,664
I had to go make it myself.

259
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:24,156
So I started baking.

260
00:09:24,157 --> 00:09:26,857
At this point, my wife and I,
we have two wonderful children

261
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,290
and three lovely granddaughters.

262
00:09:28,294 --> 00:09:29,364
I just want to win
this for them.

263
00:09:29,365 --> 00:09:32,232
In here for 5 to 8.

264
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,300
I don't know who's the baker
and who's the faker.

265
00:09:36,302 --> 00:09:38,542
I'm pretty confused.
They're all so good.

266
00:09:38,543 --> 00:09:41,639
For me, the bakers
are Henry and Michele.

267
00:09:41,642 --> 00:09:43,842
I think Michele
is being creative.

268
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:45,377
Her cinnamon churro,

269
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:47,048
it's going to go so great
with the popcorn.

270
00:09:47,049 --> 00:09:48,877
It's going to be very flavorful.

271
00:09:48,882 --> 00:09:50,215
And Henry, for me,

272
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:52,146
has been the most ambitious
in this competition.

273
00:09:52,152 --> 00:09:55,220
He is trying the most
creative use of popcorn.

274
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:56,391
How's your cheesecake
cooking in there?

275
00:09:56,392 --> 00:09:58,958
- It's going.
- Oh, Henry.

276
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,339
I thought Henry was a baker,
but I just changed my mind.

277
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,895
Why?

278
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:06,611
How many times is Henry
going to open the oven

279
00:10:06,612 --> 00:10:07,837
and let all the heat out?

280
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:10,441
How is his cheesecake
going to be cooked?

281
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,481
I think Henry looks
like a faker.

282
00:10:12,482 --> 00:10:14,308
Oh, you're just totally
switching sides.

283
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,381
So you're flipping.
Say it.

284
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:19,284
Just say it.
- I am. Am I wrong?

285
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,385
You're wrong.
You're wrong.

286
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,824
We can do this.
We can do this.

287
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:26,725
Oh.
- Splash zone.

288
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:30,057
Are you a baker
or are you a faker?

289
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:31,631
- I...
- Am...

290
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:32,998
A...

291
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,229
What?!

292
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:35,644
- What?!
- No way!

293
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:45,077
Popcorn, come to mama here.

294
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:47,908
I have my no-bake cheesecake
filling.

295
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:52,718
So the next thing I'm getting
going is the shortbread.

296
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:55,758
I want to use bacon popcorn
because it's going to be,

297
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:59,686
like, a nice savory note to go
with the cheesecake filling,

298
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:01,543
which is actually going
to be a little tart.

299
00:11:01,544 --> 00:11:03,995
There we go.
There we go.

300
00:11:04,004 --> 00:11:07,114
Jennifer looks like she's got
some kind of shortbread.

301
00:11:07,115 --> 00:11:10,207
Very smart,
that shortbread can add sweet

302
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,044
and dense texture

303
00:11:12,045 --> 00:11:14,675
that I really welcome
in a cheesecake.

304
00:11:14,681 --> 00:11:16,450
- Yes. Yeah.
- Baker all the way.

305
00:11:16,451 --> 00:11:18,179
Okay, but when you have
a wet filling

306
00:11:18,184 --> 00:11:19,654
like you have in a cheesecake,

307
00:11:19,655 --> 00:11:23,091
you need the crust to be dried
out and crisp on its own

308
00:11:23,092 --> 00:11:25,389
or you're just going
to get straight sloppy mess.

309
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:27,429
A shortbread crumble
is very fatty,

310
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,697
so it's going to stay soggy.

311
00:11:28,698 --> 00:11:31,025
I think that's
a huge faker move.

312
00:11:31,031 --> 00:11:32,531
We're in a good place here.

313
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:35,300
We got bacon on high.
Oops.

314
00:11:35,301 --> 00:11:39,271
The last thing I need
to make is the caramel sauce.

315
00:11:39,272 --> 00:11:41,712
Got to get a little
caramel going here.

316
00:11:41,713 --> 00:11:44,677
I want to give this
my special twist,

317
00:11:44,678 --> 00:11:48,714
so I'm going to add
little bits of bacon.

318
00:11:48,715 --> 00:11:50,215
No bacon left behind.

319
00:11:50,216 --> 00:11:54,654
It's going to add some texture,
and who doesn't love bacon?

320
00:11:54,655 --> 00:11:56,115
I love bacon.

321
00:11:56,122 --> 00:11:57,792
Smells good.
I smell bacon.

322
00:11:57,793 --> 00:12:00,091
Yes, ma'am.

323
00:12:00,093 --> 00:12:01,767
Jennifer is cooking bacon

324
00:12:01,768 --> 00:12:05,168
and then using the bacon
to put into her caramel sauce

325
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:09,074
to accentuate the smokiness
in her sauce.

326
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:10,975
I love that.
That's a baker.

327
00:12:10,977 --> 00:12:14,177
We got this, right?

328
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,320
Got a couple tricks
up my sleeve.

329
00:12:16,321 --> 00:12:18,416
Now that the churros are done,

330
00:12:18,418 --> 00:12:20,788
I'm working on
my graham cracker crust.

331
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:22,417
All right, popcorn.

332
00:12:22,422 --> 00:12:25,260
I think the buttered popcorn
will add a little bit of salt

333
00:12:25,261 --> 00:12:27,758
and a little bit of the butter
flavor to the crust.

334
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:29,695
So I pulse those together.

335
00:12:29,696 --> 00:12:31,126
Smells good in here.

336
00:12:31,131 --> 00:12:33,431
Now I need to get
going on my cheesecake.

337
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:35,503
I pour the cream cheese
into my mixing bowl,

338
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,870
so I can get it nice and fluffy,

339
00:12:37,871 --> 00:12:39,811
and then I'm going
to add condensed milk

340
00:12:39,812 --> 00:12:41,466
to add some sweetness.

341
00:12:41,474 --> 00:12:43,480
Time to get these in the oven.

342
00:12:43,481 --> 00:12:45,645
And then I'm going to scoop
the cheesecake mixture

343
00:12:45,646 --> 00:12:46,776
into Mason jars

344
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:50,850
so that the cheesecakes
cook faster.

345
00:12:50,851 --> 00:12:52,384
All right.

346
00:12:52,385 --> 00:12:57,085
Next, I want to concentrate
on my caramel popcorn.

347
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,320
Change it up a little bit.

348
00:12:58,324 --> 00:13:00,394
By just popping my own popcorn,

349
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:03,140
I get to create whatever
flavor I want with it,

350
00:13:03,141 --> 00:13:04,936
and the caramel will be
a perfect balance

351
00:13:04,938 --> 00:13:06,738
to my cheesecake.

352
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,207
Yummy.

353
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:11,208
Next, I get the caramel
coated onto the popcorn.

354
00:13:11,211 --> 00:13:12,351
They didn't have
my favorite caramel.

355
00:13:12,352 --> 00:13:13,875
I had to make it myself.

356
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,880
Every component Michele's making
has so much sugar in it.

357
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:18,984
She is not salting her popcorn,

358
00:13:18,985 --> 00:13:20,645
and I think, as a baker,

359
00:13:20,654 --> 00:13:24,189
you understand that balance
between salty and sweet.

360
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,758
She's a faker.

361
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:27,289
Doing good.

362
00:13:27,293 --> 00:13:29,061
- Yours baking yet?
- Oh, it's almost done.

363
00:13:29,062 --> 00:13:31,202
What are you doing over here?
You're supposed to be baking.

364
00:13:31,203 --> 00:13:33,367
Don't be coming over
here for some tips.

365
00:13:33,368 --> 00:13:35,296
I pull my cheesecakes
out of the oven,

366
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:36,541
and I put the cheesecakes
in the freezer,

367
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:37,867
so I can let them cool down.

368
00:13:37,871 --> 00:13:39,338
Hopefully they set in time.

369
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:40,669
If I serve them
a warm cheesecake,

370
00:13:40,674 --> 00:13:42,612
it's going to taste
more like a custard,

371
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,544
and the whipped cream
will just melt off.

372
00:13:44,545 --> 00:13:46,045
This is going to work.
I'm going to make it work,

373
00:13:46,046 --> 00:13:47,376
and I have no backup plan.

374
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,650
You got to keep it
chilled, you know?

375
00:13:48,651 --> 00:13:51,116
Here's my baker move for Henry.

376
00:13:51,117 --> 00:13:52,647
His cheesecakes are already
out of the oven,

377
00:13:52,653 --> 00:13:54,219
and he's giving them
time to settle

378
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,760
because if he adds
whipped cream on top,

379
00:13:55,761 --> 00:13:58,686
it's not going to just melt
into a pool of cream.

380
00:13:58,692 --> 00:14:00,262
I need that prize money.

381
00:14:00,263 --> 00:14:01,400
Come on, now.

382
00:14:01,401 --> 00:14:03,268
I feel pretty good.

383
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:04,907
We can do this.
We can do this.

384
00:14:04,908 --> 00:14:07,935
So now I need to make my
cheesecake batter, cream cheese,

385
00:14:07,941 --> 00:14:09,881
flour and eggs into all this.

386
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,306
Percy, he just looks confident.

387
00:14:12,312 --> 00:14:14,182
He's so Zen, right?

388
00:14:16,082 --> 00:14:17,817
- Oh.
- Uh-oh.

389
00:14:17,818 --> 00:14:19,418
Splash zone.

390
00:14:19,419 --> 00:14:22,054
All righty, then.
All right.

391
00:14:22,055 --> 00:14:23,585
That was such good timing.

392
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,958
I still think Percy is a baker.

393
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:28,628
I've done that so many times.

394
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:29,959
Focus here, Percy.

395
00:14:29,963 --> 00:14:31,403
You know what you need to do.

396
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:34,027
Chocolate.
I'm putting in cocoa powder

397
00:14:34,034 --> 00:14:36,736
because chocolate and the heat

398
00:14:36,737 --> 00:14:39,167
from the chili popcorn
work well together.

399
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:42,341
They just bounce off each other.
Come on, P-Dubs.

400
00:14:42,342 --> 00:14:44,552
Percy is pouring
a chocolate batter.

401
00:14:44,553 --> 00:14:46,745
He's not pouring them very high,

402
00:14:46,747 --> 00:14:48,377
which I think
is a real baker move.

403
00:14:48,381 --> 00:14:51,350
It will be cooked in time.

404
00:14:51,351 --> 00:14:53,220
We're almost a finished product.

405
00:14:53,221 --> 00:14:55,658
Now I'm making the topping
for my cheesecake.

406
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:58,156
I'm going to use
that same chili popcorn

407
00:14:58,158 --> 00:14:59,388
just to get that crunch factor.

408
00:14:59,392 --> 00:15:02,868
A few more minutes,
few more minutes.

409
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:04,399
Two minutes left.

410
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,314
Alex, who are your two bakers?

411
00:15:06,315 --> 00:15:10,506
I think my bakers
are Jennifer and Percy.

412
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:13,781
Percy, with the prebaked
crust - sign of a baker.

413
00:15:13,782 --> 00:15:17,517
And Jennifer's really
infusing flavor very smartly,

414
00:15:17,518 --> 00:15:20,018
and I think a no-bake
cheesecake's brilliant.

415
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,560
I think she chose
something foolproof,

416
00:15:21,561 --> 00:15:23,755
like a baker would.
- Daphne?

417
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:26,327
My bakers are still
Henry and Michele.

418
00:15:26,328 --> 00:15:27,756
Michele is our only person

419
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:29,461
in this kitchen
making her own popcorn.

420
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:32,369
And the Mason jars -
such a fast and easy way

421
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:34,425
to make this cheesecake
bake evenly.

422
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,303
And I think that Henry,
he is trying

423
00:15:36,304 --> 00:15:38,340
the most
creative use of popcorn.

424
00:15:38,341 --> 00:15:40,038
Henry put the popcorn
in his crust,

425
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,409
and he's adding more popcorn

426
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,207
on top of the bacon
to really crisp it up.

427
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:45,144
Henry is such a baker.

428
00:15:45,145 --> 00:15:47,975
Let's go.

429
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:52,618
10, 9, 8, 7, 6,

430
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:56,956
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

431
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:58,187
Stop your work.

432
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:00,225
Nice job.

433
00:16:00,226 --> 00:16:02,735
So everything's in place.

434
00:16:02,736 --> 00:16:04,504
I think the candied bacon

435
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,565
will kind of give you
that sweet-savory taste.

436
00:16:06,573 --> 00:16:10,275
That will give me the edge
that I need to win.

437
00:16:10,276 --> 00:16:13,646
Bakers and fakers,
I gave you 45 minutes

438
00:16:13,647 --> 00:16:15,915
to make cheesecake
using popcorn.

439
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,346
It's time to face the judges.

440
00:16:18,351 --> 00:16:20,121
Percy, what did you make for us?

441
00:16:20,122 --> 00:16:24,190
I made a chocolate cheesecake
with a chili-popcorn crust.

442
00:16:26,693 --> 00:16:29,461
Honestly, I was worried
that the chili

443
00:16:29,462 --> 00:16:32,300
and the chocolate would kind
of kill the idea of popcorn,

444
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:34,128
but it has that popcorn flavor

445
00:16:34,134 --> 00:16:35,872
and that nice heat
from the chilis.

446
00:16:35,873 --> 00:16:38,399
I do have a lot of
unpopped kernels of popcorn...

447
00:16:38,404 --> 00:16:39,471
Hmm.

448
00:16:39,472 --> 00:16:41,272
...and I'd almost
call this cheesecake

449
00:16:41,274 --> 00:16:43,776
underbaked in the center.

450
00:16:43,777 --> 00:16:45,747
Percy, the best thing
on this plate

451
00:16:45,748 --> 00:16:47,176
for me was actually this,

452
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,448
like, toffee crisp
on the bottom.

453
00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:51,318
It still is crispy.
It's still crunchy

454
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:54,386
and really holds up
to all the wetness on top of it,

455
00:16:54,387 --> 00:16:58,087
but the cheesecake didn't
hit the mark for me.

456
00:16:58,091 --> 00:17:01,031
It is undercooked in some spots.

457
00:17:01,034 --> 00:17:02,935
Jennifer?

458
00:17:02,936 --> 00:17:06,706
I did a cheesecake parfait
with a bacon-caramel sauce

459
00:17:06,707 --> 00:17:10,237
and the bacon-popcorn
shortbread.

460
00:17:11,878 --> 00:17:13,908
So, Jennifer, look.
I love your cheesecake filling.

461
00:17:13,914 --> 00:17:17,349
It's tart and not too sweet,
also a brilliant move

462
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,050
because everything else
layered on here

463
00:17:19,052 --> 00:17:20,289
does have its own sweetness,

464
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,116
and I think that was
a smart balance.

465
00:17:22,122 --> 00:17:24,790
But the shortbread crumb
at the bottom,

466
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:27,930
for me, wasn't as successful
because it's a very wet crumb,

467
00:17:27,931 --> 00:17:30,528
and I think when you have
so many layers of wet,

468
00:17:30,531 --> 00:17:33,301
you actually are craving
something drying at the bottom.

469
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,329
Yeah.

470
00:17:34,334 --> 00:17:36,874
The caramel and the bacon
is just so good.

471
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,104
That combination is dynamite.

472
00:17:39,105 --> 00:17:40,635
If I were in a conversation

473
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:42,641
with somebody eating this,
I would stop.

474
00:17:42,643 --> 00:17:44,677
You lose me a little

475
00:17:44,678 --> 00:17:46,447
with your crumble
topping in the bottom.

476
00:17:46,448 --> 00:17:47,876
You chose a glass like this.

477
00:17:47,881 --> 00:17:49,719
I got to get all the way down.

478
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,846
I mean, I got to go to
the sub-subbasement...

479
00:17:51,852 --> 00:17:53,152
Yeah.

480
00:17:53,153 --> 00:17:55,287
...to get the crust
of my cheesecake.

481
00:17:55,288 --> 00:17:56,288
- Michele?
- Yes?

482
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:57,259
What did you make?

483
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,824
I made a cheesecake

484
00:17:58,825 --> 00:18:02,365
with caramel popcorn
and a cinnamon churro.

485
00:18:03,403 --> 00:18:05,473
Your cheesecake
is beautifully cooked,

486
00:18:05,474 --> 00:18:09,441
really soft, creamy, luscious,

487
00:18:09,442 --> 00:18:12,380
and your crumb is the most
satisfying in its texture

488
00:18:12,381 --> 00:18:13,948
with the dryness of it playing

489
00:18:13,949 --> 00:18:16,716
so nicely with that
luscious cheesecake topping.

490
00:18:16,717 --> 00:18:18,817
But your churro, to me,

491
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:21,019
tastes like a cream puff
that was deep-fried

492
00:18:21,021 --> 00:18:22,521
and then rolled
in cinnamon sugar.

493
00:18:22,523 --> 00:18:25,925
It doesn't have that
sort of yeasty-dough taste

494
00:18:25,926 --> 00:18:27,826
that I associate with churros.

495
00:18:27,828 --> 00:18:30,297
- I like your cheesecake...
- Thank you.

496
00:18:30,298 --> 00:18:32,696
...in terms of texture
and baking and execution,

497
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:35,099
and you popped your own popcorn.
You're the only one.

498
00:18:35,101 --> 00:18:36,836
The unique chewiness

499
00:18:36,837 --> 00:18:39,406
of freshly popped popcorn,
it's really good.

500
00:18:39,407 --> 00:18:42,405
But I think, overall,
the popcorn, a little sweet.

501
00:18:42,408 --> 00:18:45,244
This popcorn really needed salt.
- Okay.

502
00:18:45,245 --> 00:18:46,045
- Henry!
- Yes?

503
00:18:46,046 --> 00:18:47,376
What did you make for us?

504
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:51,320
I made a maple-bacon
popcorn cheesecake.

505
00:18:53,587 --> 00:18:55,917
I'm getting a lot of the flavor
of the popcorn,

506
00:18:55,922 --> 00:18:57,857
particularly the crust.

507
00:18:57,858 --> 00:18:59,788
It's packed.

508
00:18:59,793 --> 00:19:01,903
It's got that
compressed feeling.

509
00:19:01,904 --> 00:19:04,069
It's almost like a cookie.

510
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:07,006
But your cheesecake
is undercooked,

511
00:19:07,007 --> 00:19:09,374
and when I eat
the bacon, weirdly,

512
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,675
the taste of the uncooked egg

513
00:19:11,678 --> 00:19:14,446
comes out in the smoke
of the bacon.

514
00:19:14,447 --> 00:19:17,817
The flavoring of this
custard is fantastic.

515
00:19:17,818 --> 00:19:20,786
I love this combination
of maple and bacon.

516
00:19:20,787 --> 00:19:24,087
Your custard is so sweet
and so powerfully flavorful

517
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:26,190
that I like it even better

518
00:19:26,192 --> 00:19:29,231
when it's blended
with this very neutral cream.

519
00:19:29,232 --> 00:19:31,399
Did you want your
bacon to be crispy?

520
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,427
- Yes.
- You did?

521
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:35,971
I think the idea to put the
popcorn on top was a clever one,

522
00:19:35,972 --> 00:19:37,438
but I do think
it would have been

523
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:38,637
a more satisfying pairing

524
00:19:38,639 --> 00:19:42,639
if this had been
a crispier bacon.

525
00:19:42,643 --> 00:19:44,343
- Thanks, Henry.
- Thank you.

526
00:19:44,344 --> 00:19:46,354
And I want to thank
all of you guys.

527
00:19:46,355 --> 00:19:47,976
Now comes the hard part.

528
00:19:47,981 --> 00:19:50,781
The judges need to deliberate.

529
00:19:50,784 --> 00:19:53,322
My dish - It definitely isn't
as cooked as I wanted it to be.

530
00:19:53,323 --> 00:19:54,619
If I go home right now,

531
00:19:54,621 --> 00:19:56,021
I don't know how I'm going
to face my family.

532
00:19:56,022 --> 00:19:57,692
They're going to be
so disappointed in me,

533
00:19:57,693 --> 00:20:00,201
and most of all, I'm going
to be disappointed in myself.

534
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:10,205
Bakers and fakers,

535
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,410
now it's time to find out
who won the round,

536
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:17,983
who's going home and who
that person really is.

537
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:19,084
Alex?

538
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:21,385
The winner of this round is...

539
00:20:26,126 --> 00:20:27,686
...Michele.

540
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:31,363
Yay.
Thank you.

541
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:33,733
The texture of your custard,

542
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:35,803
the crust underneath,
it really came together,

543
00:20:35,804 --> 00:20:39,209
and we really liked that you
used both the ready-made popcorn

544
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,835
and you popped your own, fresh.

545
00:20:40,841 --> 00:20:42,608
Good job.
- Thank you.

546
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:46,309
I just won Round 1.
Are you kidding me right now?

547
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:50,048
Daphne, please, tell us.

548
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:53,490
Who made
the second-best cheesecake?

549
00:20:57,858 --> 00:20:59,188
Jennifer.
Well done.

550
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:01,002
Well done, Jennifer.

551
00:21:01,003 --> 00:21:03,541
Good job, Jennifer.
You're safe.

552
00:21:05,939 --> 00:21:07,507
Okay, judges.

553
00:21:07,508 --> 00:21:09,708
We are down to
your bottom two bakers.

554
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:13,480
Alex, please tell us
who's moving on to Round 2.

555
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,250
Henry.
- Yes.

556
00:21:19,252 --> 00:21:22,662
- Good job, man.
- Thank you.

557
00:21:24,725 --> 00:21:27,825
Unfortunately, Percy, that means
you've been eliminated.

558
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:33,028
But before you go,
tell us, are you a baker

559
00:21:33,033 --> 00:21:35,200
or are you a faker?

560
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:39,371
I... am...

561
00:21:39,372 --> 00:21:41,541
a...

562
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:42,742
faker.

563
00:21:42,743 --> 00:21:44,744
- Oh!
- Oh!

564
00:21:44,745 --> 00:21:46,275
Get out of here.

565
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:48,009
That's some cheesecake
for a faker.

566
00:21:48,014 --> 00:21:49,452
What do you do for a living?

567
00:21:49,453 --> 00:21:51,519
Many folks in New York
know me from being

568
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,988
on gospel music radio
in New York City for many years.

569
00:21:53,989 --> 00:21:55,354
No way.

570
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,755
What I love about radio

571
00:21:56,757 --> 00:22:00,057
is that it takes me
into people's worlds.

572
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,466
I'm Percy Williams
on your radio.

573
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:03,137
Thank you very much
for listening, New York,

574
00:22:03,138 --> 00:22:04,906
New Jersey and Connecticut.

575
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:06,435
I get a chance to inspire them,

576
00:22:06,439 --> 00:22:09,077
and I get that same feeling
while baking.

577
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,335
Keep it locked where it's at.

578
00:22:10,343 --> 00:22:13,946
You're enjoying music
for your spirit.

579
00:22:13,947 --> 00:22:15,477
And nowadays, I bake for family.

580
00:22:15,481 --> 00:22:16,719
I bake for friends.

581
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,617
I like the happiness that
I see on people's faces

582
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,960
when they enjoy something
that I baked in my kitchen.

583
00:22:21,961 --> 00:22:26,085
So how would you describe your
dessert in your radio voice?

584
00:22:26,092 --> 00:22:29,031
That was Brotha Percy's
chocolate cheesecake

585
00:22:29,032 --> 00:22:31,159
with a beautiful
chili popcorn crust.

586
00:22:31,164 --> 00:22:32,865
Enjoy.

587
00:22:32,866 --> 00:22:34,066
I love it. I love it.

588
00:22:34,067 --> 00:22:35,367
Thank you, Percy.

589
00:22:37,871 --> 00:22:42,675
Hello, bakers and faker.

590
00:22:42,676 --> 00:22:47,476
I'm giving you the freedom
to bake whatever you want...

591
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,014
Yay.

592
00:22:49,015 --> 00:22:51,715
...as long as you
incorporate...

593
00:22:53,654 --> 00:22:55,655
...marshmallows.

594
00:22:55,656 --> 00:22:57,386
- Oh.
- Oh.

595
00:23:00,661 --> 00:23:03,168
Mm. Marshmallow
is so sweet,

596
00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:05,139
and it really can
overpower your dish.

597
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,968
So I am not happy
about this ingredient.

598
00:23:07,974 --> 00:23:09,241
Ugh, okay.

599
00:23:09,242 --> 00:23:12,678
We got freeze-dried
marshmallows,

600
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:14,346
vanilla marshmallows,

601
00:23:14,347 --> 00:23:17,247
coconut marshmallows,

602
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:21,760
peppermint marshmallows
and marshmallow cream.

603
00:23:23,924 --> 00:23:26,094
45 minutes
on the clock, you ready?

604
00:23:26,095 --> 00:23:28,392
- Ready.
- Yes.

605
00:23:28,394 --> 00:23:29,804
- Get baking!
- Whoo!

606
00:23:31,832 --> 00:23:32,869
All right, guys.

607
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,496
What do you think
of marshmallows?

608
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,669
I like this ingredient
because you can play with it.

609
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:39,340
Yeah. I immediately
thought of toasting them,

610
00:23:39,341 --> 00:23:42,775
kind of hoping that someone
who's a baker explores

611
00:23:42,776 --> 00:23:44,206
that idea of the toasted,

612
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:47,210
almost-burned marshmallow
and the goo.

613
00:23:47,213 --> 00:23:49,523
I love marshmallows melted
into hot cocoa.

614
00:23:49,524 --> 00:23:51,816
If you make hot chocolate

615
00:23:51,818 --> 00:23:53,818
and throw the marshmallows in,
that's a cop-out.

616
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,260
For anybody who's had
a hot chocolate

617
00:23:55,261 --> 00:23:56,715
at the bus station,

618
00:23:56,723 --> 00:23:58,663
there's something endearing
about that to me.

619
00:23:58,664 --> 00:24:00,859
Totally.
The baker will know

620
00:24:00,861 --> 00:24:03,139
that marshmallow itself
is just pure sugar,

621
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,304
and we want to see
a little bit of bitterness

622
00:24:05,305 --> 00:24:07,535
that I think will carry the
marshmallow flavor a long way.

623
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:11,076
For me, I would
definitely go for salt.

624
00:24:11,077 --> 00:24:12,507
I would go peanut butter.

625
00:24:12,513 --> 00:24:14,823
I think marshmallow and peanut
butter pair beautifully.

626
00:24:14,824 --> 00:24:16,545
Maybe a carrot cake

627
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:20,350
and then make the filling
with the marshmallow cream.

628
00:24:21,688 --> 00:24:24,588
So I guess loser's
buying drinks tonight?

629
00:24:24,591 --> 00:24:25,691
All right.

630
00:24:25,692 --> 00:24:26,926
I'm very embarrassed

631
00:24:26,927 --> 00:24:28,257
that my cheesecake
was undercooked,

632
00:24:28,261 --> 00:24:29,601
but making it
through motivates me

633
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:31,496
more to kill it
in the second round.

634
00:24:31,497 --> 00:24:33,797
- Is that carrots?
- It's carrots.

635
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,600
What?

636
00:24:34,601 --> 00:24:35,670
So for Round 2,

637
00:24:35,671 --> 00:24:37,238
I'm going to be
making a carrot cake

638
00:24:37,239 --> 00:24:39,807
with a cream cheese
marshmallow frosting.

639
00:24:39,808 --> 00:24:41,974
I'm baking carrot cake.

640
00:24:41,975 --> 00:24:43,575
My wife's my number-one fan.

641
00:24:43,577 --> 00:24:46,247
So I'm going to make this
carrot cake to honor my wife.

642
00:24:46,248 --> 00:24:47,976
Henry's making a carrot cake.

643
00:24:47,981 --> 00:24:49,081
That's a great idea.

644
00:24:49,082 --> 00:24:50,752
I'm a sucker for carrot cakes.

645
00:24:50,753 --> 00:24:53,091
So I really love the texture
of the grated carrots

646
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:54,286
in the cake.

647
00:24:54,287 --> 00:24:55,557
It's a risky move.

648
00:24:55,558 --> 00:24:57,186
Not everyone does
like carrot cake,

649
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,859
and I'm obsessed.

650
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,400
Plenty of time.

651
00:25:01,401 --> 00:25:03,471
My strategy for this round
is to get the cake in the oven

652
00:25:03,472 --> 00:25:05,708
as soon as I can
and to stack the cakes,

653
00:25:05,709 --> 00:25:08,206
so the cakes will hold up
to the cream cheese frosting.

654
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:09,938
All right.

655
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:11,913
I start mixing the oil,
the sugar and the eggs,

656
00:25:11,914 --> 00:25:13,952
and then I get the dry
ingredients together...

657
00:25:13,953 --> 00:25:16,247
Make sure it's exact.

658
00:25:16,249 --> 00:25:19,719
...and then fold
in the shredded carrots,

659
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,860
get that all set
and stick it in the oven.

660
00:25:21,861 --> 00:25:23,115
I got it.

661
00:25:23,123 --> 00:25:24,557
Now that that's in,

662
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:26,158
I start making
the cream cheese frosting.

663
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,827
Cheese.
I'm going to use

664
00:25:27,828 --> 00:25:29,858
the marshmallow cream
in the cream cheese frosting

665
00:25:29,863 --> 00:25:31,103
to give it the sweetness,

666
00:25:31,104 --> 00:25:33,827
and hopefully,
that'll shine through.

667
00:25:33,834 --> 00:25:35,474
Marshmallows and carrots -
two things that I don't think

668
00:25:35,475 --> 00:25:38,838
would ever go well,
but I can make this happen.

669
00:25:38,839 --> 00:25:40,069
Henry's doing

670
00:25:40,073 --> 00:25:42,143
a marshmallow
cream cheese topping.

671
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,111
I think it's going to be sweet.
- Why?

672
00:25:44,112 --> 00:25:46,010
The yin and the yang
with carrot cake

673
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:49,649
is that snap you get when
you eat the cream cheese,

674
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:53,320
and if it's too marshmallowy,
it's going to miss that tang.

675
00:25:53,321 --> 00:25:55,187
- I agree with that.
- That's a faker.

676
00:25:55,188 --> 00:25:56,758
I have to tell you,
I am kind of excited

677
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:58,687
about a marshmallow-flavored
frosting.

678
00:25:58,692 --> 00:25:59,925
I hope he torches it.

679
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:01,536
I hope he gives it some nice,
like, deep, dark,

680
00:26:01,537 --> 00:26:02,735
golden-brown bitterness,

681
00:26:02,736 --> 00:26:05,236
which is going to play
this cake even more savory

682
00:26:05,238 --> 00:26:07,668
than a traditional
carrot cake would be.

683
00:26:07,674 --> 00:26:09,041
Baker move.

684
00:26:09,042 --> 00:26:10,175
In we go.

685
00:26:10,176 --> 00:26:11,544
There we go.

686
00:26:11,545 --> 00:26:14,345
You're talking
to yourself over there.

687
00:26:14,347 --> 00:26:16,347
I can make anything I want.

688
00:26:16,349 --> 00:26:18,179
So I want to make something

689
00:26:18,184 --> 00:26:21,120
that reminds a lot
of people of childhood.

690
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,288
I am making peanut butter

691
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:27,889
and marshmallow cream pies
and peanut brittle.

692
00:26:27,894 --> 00:26:29,328
Okay.

693
00:26:29,329 --> 00:26:31,329
I'm using almond flour

694
00:26:31,331 --> 00:26:33,531
to make these
little pie crusts...

695
00:26:33,534 --> 00:26:34,700
Sugar.

696
00:26:34,701 --> 00:26:37,401
...but because of
the high fat content,

697
00:26:37,403 --> 00:26:40,172
it takes a little bit
longer to bake.

698
00:26:40,173 --> 00:26:44,013
I just want to get those in the
oven as quickly as possible.

699
00:26:44,014 --> 00:26:45,778
Want to grease that first.

700
00:26:45,779 --> 00:26:49,148
I put a little bit of butter
on the bottom of the jars

701
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:51,118
to make sure they don't stick.

702
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:53,247
Get a little bit
of that dough in there.

703
00:26:53,253 --> 00:26:55,222
Jennifer is making
an almond crust,

704
00:26:55,223 --> 00:26:58,190
and she's packing it
in those small jelly jars.

705
00:26:58,191 --> 00:27:00,091
I feel like we've
seen ground-up,

706
00:27:00,093 --> 00:27:02,073
baked crust already
this competition.

707
00:27:02,074 --> 00:27:05,668
That's a faker move.
- Mm.

708
00:27:05,672 --> 00:27:07,272
Off you go.

709
00:27:07,273 --> 00:27:08,743
Time to make some candy.

710
00:27:08,744 --> 00:27:11,080
Peanut brittle was
the first candy

711
00:27:11,081 --> 00:27:13,307
I learned how to make
with my dad.

712
00:27:13,313 --> 00:27:16,053
So I need to get that
started with some sugar

713
00:27:16,054 --> 00:27:18,217
and some corn syrup,

714
00:27:18,218 --> 00:27:21,518
and I'm using salted,
roasted peanuts.

715
00:27:21,522 --> 00:27:23,092
Come on, baby, cook for me.

716
00:27:23,093 --> 00:27:26,125
Ah!

717
00:27:26,126 --> 00:27:27,186
So Jennifer has a candy
thermometer out,

718
00:27:27,193 --> 00:27:28,661
baker all the way.

719
00:27:28,662 --> 00:27:30,162
It's definitely a baker.

720
00:27:30,163 --> 00:27:32,133
Baking's a science.
You can't eyeball it.

721
00:27:32,134 --> 00:27:33,532
There we go.

722
00:27:33,534 --> 00:27:36,368
It would be really nice
to win the money.

723
00:27:36,369 --> 00:27:38,469
I haven't been able
to see my dad for years

724
00:27:38,471 --> 00:27:41,340
because it's expensive
to take time off

725
00:27:41,341 --> 00:27:43,709
and go and visit him.

726
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,178
That looks beautiful.

727
00:27:46,179 --> 00:27:47,809
How many can I fit in my hand?

728
00:27:47,814 --> 00:27:48,948
Whoo!

729
00:27:48,949 --> 00:27:51,019
I'm not a big fan
of marshmallows.

730
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,747
They are so sweet.

731
00:27:52,753 --> 00:27:56,288
But that's what always
goes in hot cocoa,

732
00:27:56,289 --> 00:28:00,225
and hot cocoa reminds me
of sitting around the fire

733
00:28:00,226 --> 00:28:01,966
with my grandma.

734
00:28:01,968 --> 00:28:03,298
All right.
Here we go.

735
00:28:03,303 --> 00:28:06,438
So I am baking
a hot cocoa cupcake

736
00:28:06,439 --> 00:28:10,075
with marshmallow buttercream
filling.

737
00:28:10,076 --> 00:28:11,706
I'm, like, making
a mess over here.

738
00:28:11,712 --> 00:28:14,312
The first thing I need to do
is get my batter made.

739
00:28:14,314 --> 00:28:16,554
All right.
I'm shaving the chocolate down

740
00:28:16,555 --> 00:28:19,318
so it will melt a lot faster.

741
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:22,089
I decided to add a little hint
of espresso in there

742
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:24,156
to bring the chocolate out more.

743
00:28:24,157 --> 00:28:25,527
I love that Michele
is using espresso

744
00:28:25,528 --> 00:28:27,026
to enhance her chocolate flavor.

745
00:28:27,027 --> 00:28:28,957
I think that's
a real baker move.

746
00:28:28,962 --> 00:28:31,062
Going to taste
like Grandma's house.

747
00:28:31,064 --> 00:28:33,270
This recipe comes directly
from my grandma.

748
00:28:33,271 --> 00:28:35,436
It's got such
a deep chocolate taste.

749
00:28:35,437 --> 00:28:37,895
I know it's going to take it
to the next level.

750
00:28:37,904 --> 00:28:41,443
I want to win this competition
in memory of my grandmother.

751
00:28:41,444 --> 00:28:43,241
She taught me everything I know,

752
00:28:43,243 --> 00:28:45,781
and I really want to show
how far I've come

753
00:28:45,782 --> 00:28:48,879
and how proud my grandma
would be of me today.

754
00:28:48,882 --> 00:28:50,622
I am going in the oven.

755
00:28:51,151 --> 00:28:53,451
Here we go.

756
00:28:53,453 --> 00:28:55,588
I check on my crust.

757
00:28:55,589 --> 00:28:58,927
I had put a little bit of butter
on the bottom of the jars

758
00:28:58,928 --> 00:29:00,925
to make sure they didn't stick.

759
00:29:00,934 --> 00:29:02,672
They turned out
a little buttery.

760
00:29:02,673 --> 00:29:04,909
When the crusts
come out of the oven,

761
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,405
that butter has seeped up.

762
00:29:07,407 --> 00:29:10,707
So I had little pools of hot
butter on top of the crust.

763
00:29:10,711 --> 00:29:12,111
Oh, man.

764
00:29:12,112 --> 00:29:15,548
Check out Jennifer,
soggy and greasy crust.

765
00:29:15,549 --> 00:29:16,916
It is a disaster.

766
00:29:16,917 --> 00:29:20,947
I don't want the judges
biting into a chunk of butter.

767
00:29:20,954 --> 00:29:23,064
I might have to make this again.

768
00:29:31,765 --> 00:29:33,665
They turned out
a little buttery.

769
00:29:33,667 --> 00:29:36,297
When the crusts
come out of the oven,

770
00:29:36,302 --> 00:29:39,841
I had little pools of hot butter
on top of the crust.

771
00:29:39,842 --> 00:29:41,440
I might have to make this again,

772
00:29:41,441 --> 00:29:45,311
but I don't have enough time
to start over.

773
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,182
We'll clean you up.

774
00:29:47,183 --> 00:29:49,448
So given the time frame,

775
00:29:49,449 --> 00:29:53,089
I'm going to stick to my guns
and stay with what I've made.

776
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,386
There we go.

777
00:29:54,387 --> 00:29:56,756
So I have to try
to soak up that butter.

778
00:29:56,757 --> 00:29:59,057
Let's go cool you off.

779
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:00,225
That's my timer.

780
00:30:00,226 --> 00:30:01,326
So I take the cake
out of the oven

781
00:30:01,334 --> 00:30:02,640
and set them in the freezer.

782
00:30:02,641 --> 00:30:03,866
Got a hot pan coming through.

783
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,870
This definitely is a huge risk
that I'm taking

784
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:08,172
because it could ruin
the texture of the cake,

785
00:30:08,174 --> 00:30:09,544
but at this point, I'm panicking

786
00:30:09,545 --> 00:30:11,243
because I need to get
these cakes cooled

787
00:30:11,244 --> 00:30:12,954
so that they can set up in time.

788
00:30:12,955 --> 00:30:16,476
Henry immediately put the cake
in the refrigerator

789
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:18,718
after it came out of the oven.

790
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:21,857
I think that really compromised
the last few minutes of baking.

791
00:30:21,858 --> 00:30:23,155
I feel like it's not done.

792
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:24,356
That's a faker move.

793
00:30:24,357 --> 00:30:25,825
And this.

794
00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:28,426
Next, I'm going to toast some
almonds to give it some texture.

795
00:30:28,428 --> 00:30:30,158
I think I'm the one that's going
to be winning today.

796
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:33,633
So I stick them in the oven.

797
00:30:33,634 --> 00:30:36,602
Almost done.

798
00:30:36,603 --> 00:30:38,743
Every year, I make my wife
a birthday cake,

799
00:30:38,744 --> 00:30:40,305
and it's carrot cake.

800
00:30:40,306 --> 00:30:42,506
So the last thing I want to do
is melt some chocolate

801
00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:44,649
and write
"Happy Birthday" on the plate.

802
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:45,705
Look at Henry.

803
00:30:45,712 --> 00:30:47,550
Watch him cut this
parchment paper.

804
00:30:47,551 --> 00:30:48,717
Watch him fold it.

805
00:30:48,718 --> 00:30:50,275
He's making his own
points right now.

806
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:52,151
I mean, who is this person?

807
00:30:52,152 --> 00:30:54,292
He's a mathematician or a baker.

808
00:30:54,293 --> 00:30:58,417
He's a calligraphy teacher
who does greeting cards.

809
00:30:58,424 --> 00:31:00,425
I hope these come out.

810
00:31:00,426 --> 00:31:02,596
Let's go stick you
in the chiller.

811
00:31:02,603 --> 00:31:05,741
I've got the crust
and the brittle in the cooler.

812
00:31:05,742 --> 00:31:09,079
Now I'm going to work
on the peanut butter mousse.

813
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,675
And just salt here,
little vanilla.

814
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:16,749
Then I'm going to whip
some cream to a soft peak.

815
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:19,550
Okay.
There we go.

816
00:31:19,553 --> 00:31:25,324
And then I fold that whipped
cream into the peanut butter.

817
00:31:25,325 --> 00:31:26,985
I like that Jennifer
is folding cream

818
00:31:26,993 --> 00:31:29,762
into her peanut butter mixture
to keep it light and fluffy.

819
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,463
Okay.

820
00:31:31,464 --> 00:31:33,766
Jennifer is definitely a baker.

821
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:35,767
This last one.

822
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:40,569
The next thing I need to start
is the marshmallow cream.

823
00:31:40,574 --> 00:31:43,643
I pipe it on top
of the peanut butter mousse.

824
00:31:43,644 --> 00:31:45,611
Okay.

825
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,352
Ooh, she's getting a torch out.
Watch out, everyone.

826
00:31:47,353 --> 00:31:49,147
Playing with fire.

827
00:31:49,149 --> 00:31:51,849
I want to brûlée
the tops a little.

828
00:31:51,852 --> 00:31:53,392
All right.
Look at what Jennifer's doing.

829
00:31:53,393 --> 00:31:55,386
Like, that, to me,
is a faker move.

830
00:31:55,388 --> 00:31:57,557
The cream, it wasn't
transformed at all.

831
00:31:57,558 --> 00:31:59,488
Jennifer really just, you know,
took it out of the jar

832
00:31:59,492 --> 00:32:01,634
and put it onto the plate.

833
00:32:01,635 --> 00:32:02,965
Perfect.

834
00:32:02,969 --> 00:32:05,838
Toasting really changes
the flavor of a marshmallow.

835
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:10,839
I think this dish is going
to impress the judges.

836
00:32:10,844 --> 00:32:12,111
There we go.

837
00:32:12,112 --> 00:32:14,647
Check my cupcake.
Almost.

838
00:32:14,648 --> 00:32:16,618
Now that the cupcakes
are in the oven,

839
00:32:16,619 --> 00:32:19,087
I want to start
on my marshmallow buttercream.

840
00:32:19,088 --> 00:32:21,145
Ooh, this stuff's sweet.

841
00:32:21,154 --> 00:32:22,692
I want to use
that marshmallow cream

842
00:32:22,693 --> 00:32:25,489
because it's already melted
down and ready to go.

843
00:32:25,491 --> 00:32:28,360
All right.
What a mess.

844
00:32:28,361 --> 00:32:30,361
If I don't balance
that marshmallow cream

845
00:32:30,363 --> 00:32:31,864
with enough butter,

846
00:32:31,865 --> 00:32:33,465
it might make it way too sweet

847
00:32:33,466 --> 00:32:37,136
and overpower the chocolate.

848
00:32:37,137 --> 00:32:38,767
Come on, baby.

849
00:32:38,772 --> 00:32:40,372
I want to get my ganache going,

850
00:32:40,373 --> 00:32:43,442
so when the cupcakes are ready,
I can just dip them.

851
00:32:43,443 --> 00:32:45,383
All right.
I'm adding a little bit

852
00:32:45,384 --> 00:32:48,178
of corn syrup
to give it a nice shine.

853
00:32:48,181 --> 00:32:50,719
I think she's probably
making a ganache frosting.

854
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,517
Michele's adding corn syrup
to her chocolate chips

855
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,655
to make sure
it's glossy and smooth.

856
00:32:55,656 --> 00:32:57,016
You do want a bitter
chocolate topping

857
00:32:57,023 --> 00:32:58,363
on what is going to be

858
00:32:58,364 --> 00:33:01,398
an extremely sweet
sugar bomb of a cupcake.

859
00:33:01,401 --> 00:33:03,001
I think that's
a really baker move.

860
00:33:03,003 --> 00:33:04,203
I agree.

861
00:33:04,204 --> 00:33:07,172
Ganache is done.
All right.

862
00:33:07,173 --> 00:33:08,813
I get my cupcakes
out of the oven.

863
00:33:08,814 --> 00:33:10,375
Come on, baby.

864
00:33:10,376 --> 00:33:12,945
I want to use the fondant
to make a little handle off

865
00:33:12,946 --> 00:33:14,076
the side of the cupcake.

866
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,680
Everything's got to be edible.

867
00:33:15,682 --> 00:33:18,382
- She's making some decorations.
- I don't like that.

868
00:33:18,384 --> 00:33:21,123
What does fondant have
to do with marshmallow?

869
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,559
There's a lot of frills
on Michele's cooking.

870
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,227
I'm in it to win it.

871
00:33:25,228 --> 00:33:27,885
Two minutes left.

872
00:33:27,894 --> 00:33:29,500
Alex, who are your two bakers?

873
00:33:29,501 --> 00:33:32,495
I'm going to go with Jennifer
because of her concept.

874
00:33:32,498 --> 00:33:33,866
You're so pretty.

875
00:33:33,867 --> 00:33:36,936
Love the toasted and burned
edges of marshmallows.

876
00:33:36,937 --> 00:33:39,237
So all she had to do was
toast that marshmallow,

877
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:41,269
and you went hook,
line and sinker?

878
00:33:41,274 --> 00:33:43,184
It doesn't take much for me
to get on your team.

879
00:33:43,185 --> 00:33:45,476
It doesn't take much
for me to jump ship.

880
00:33:46,647 --> 00:33:49,377
And Michele did
the pro pastry bag,

881
00:33:49,382 --> 00:33:52,885
twisting the top to get
all the air out of it,

882
00:33:52,886 --> 00:33:54,786
and adding the corn syrup

883
00:33:54,788 --> 00:33:57,456
to the glaze
was a really nice touch

884
00:33:57,457 --> 00:33:59,887
that makes the chocolate
shiny and slick.

885
00:33:59,893 --> 00:34:01,103
That's a total baker move.

886
00:34:01,104 --> 00:34:02,535
All right.
Daphne?

887
00:34:02,536 --> 00:34:05,236
I stay loyal to
the bitter, bitter end.

888
00:34:05,238 --> 00:34:08,168
My bakers are Henry and Michele.

889
00:34:08,174 --> 00:34:09,484
Michele has thought
of everything.

890
00:34:09,485 --> 00:34:11,805
Her cupcakes are perfectly iced,

891
00:34:11,812 --> 00:34:14,050
and marshmallow is going
to feature prominently

892
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:15,917
in Michele's dish
no matter what.

893
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,246
Meanwhile, my man, Henry,

894
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,220
who I've been rooting for
from the beginning,

895
00:34:19,221 --> 00:34:22,357
I like to see Henry cut rounds
out of his carrot cake

896
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:24,624
and doing a layering
of marshmallow frosting.

897
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:26,585
It's going to be
a very textural play,

898
00:34:26,593 --> 00:34:28,761
and that's a baker move to me.

899
00:34:28,762 --> 00:34:29,762
Okay, guys.

900
00:34:29,763 --> 00:34:34,634
10, 9, 8, 7, 6,

901
00:34:34,635 --> 00:34:39,065
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

902
00:34:39,072 --> 00:34:40,439
Stop your work.

903
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,110
- Yeah.
- Drop the marshmallows.

904
00:34:45,779 --> 00:34:47,248
Looking down at my dish,

905
00:34:47,249 --> 00:34:50,047
the presentation came out
exactly how I wanted.

906
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,850
What it comes down to is flavor.

907
00:34:51,852 --> 00:34:53,252
I'm still a little concerned

908
00:34:53,253 --> 00:34:57,122
if the marshmallow's
going to come through.

909
00:34:57,123 --> 00:35:00,666
Are you a baker or a faker?

910
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:02,635
- I...
- Am...

911
00:35:02,636 --> 00:35:04,296
A...

912
00:35:04,304 --> 00:35:05,304
- Yes!
- No!

913
00:35:05,305 --> 00:35:08,465
- Yes!
- Oh. Really?

914
00:35:13,914 --> 00:35:15,681
Bakers and faker,

915
00:35:15,682 --> 00:35:18,751
you had 45 minutes
to bake anything you want,

916
00:35:18,752 --> 00:35:21,022
as long as it had
some marshmallows in it.

917
00:35:21,023 --> 00:35:24,121
But now you must
face the judges.

918
00:35:24,124 --> 00:35:25,925
Henry, what'd you do, man?

919
00:35:25,926 --> 00:35:27,356
Well, I made a carrot cake

920
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,030
with a cream cheese
marshmallow frosting.

921
00:35:31,031 --> 00:35:32,769
That cake is kind of
inspired by my wife.

922
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:35,796
It's her favorite flavor.
I figured I'd pay homage to her.

923
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:38,337
Henry, you made
a really good cake.

924
00:35:38,338 --> 00:35:40,508
I really loved
the grated carrot texture,

925
00:35:40,509 --> 00:35:42,477
and I love
the "Happy Birthday" piping.

926
00:35:42,478 --> 00:35:45,475
The calligraphy was expert.

927
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:48,778
But I think your cake
is borderline undercooked,

928
00:35:48,782 --> 00:35:52,084
and I think the cream cheese
in this frosting

929
00:35:52,085 --> 00:35:53,845
overpower the marshmallow.

930
00:35:53,854 --> 00:35:56,124
I agree with you.
I don't taste the marshmallow

931
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:59,291
in the frosting,
but it is delicious.

932
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:02,301
- Thank you.
- And I love the toasted almonds.

933
00:36:02,302 --> 00:36:03,971
They really give a great crunch,

934
00:36:03,972 --> 00:36:06,438
but they could have had
a little bit of salt on them.

935
00:36:06,439 --> 00:36:08,039
I just wish there'd
been more marshmallow.

936
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,041
Thank you.

937
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,876
Michele, what did you make?

938
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:14,077
I made a hot-cocoa cupcake
with marshmallow filling

939
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,719
and then some mini
marshmallows on top.

940
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,447
I think you've made
an amazing cupcake.

941
00:36:18,451 --> 00:36:19,484
Thank you.

942
00:36:19,485 --> 00:36:21,485
The bitterness of the chocolate,

943
00:36:21,487 --> 00:36:23,556
and then we get
this gooey filling.

944
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:25,424
It's just perfect.
- Great.

945
00:36:25,425 --> 00:36:27,355
But you made a number
of components,

946
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,200
the fondant, I think
this stuff is beautiful,

947
00:36:30,201 --> 00:36:33,196
but it just didn't
taste like marshmallow.

948
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:36,936
Michele, the execution
on this dish is perfect.

949
00:36:36,937 --> 00:36:38,367
The crumb is so moist.

950
00:36:38,371 --> 00:36:40,540
It is so decadent
and rich and chocolaty,

951
00:36:40,541 --> 00:36:43,408
the glossy ganache on top,
perfect.

952
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,409
I will say this.
Those little mini marshmallows,

953
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,049
torching them a little bit,
I think,

954
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:48,777
would have worked
really nicely as well.

955
00:36:48,782 --> 00:36:51,651
It changes the texture
and the flavor of a marshmallow.

956
00:36:51,652 --> 00:36:53,018
Right.

957
00:36:53,019 --> 00:36:54,757
Jennifer,
what'd you make for us?

958
00:36:54,758 --> 00:36:57,655
I made a peanut butter
and marshmallow cream pie

959
00:36:57,658 --> 00:37:00,998
with an almond crust
and a peanut brittle.

960
00:37:02,636 --> 00:37:05,236
The brittle is delicious.

961
00:37:05,238 --> 00:37:07,938
It's, like, an avalanche
of all the nuts.

962
00:37:07,941 --> 00:37:09,641
I mean, I love it.

963
00:37:09,643 --> 00:37:13,013
But when I get the peanut butter
and the almond crust,

964
00:37:13,014 --> 00:37:16,148
it's tough for the marshmallow
to survive the street fight.

965
00:37:16,149 --> 00:37:17,419
It just doesn't taste
like marshmallows.

966
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,646
Okay.

967
00:37:18,652 --> 00:37:20,492
I do think
this peanut butter filling

968
00:37:20,493 --> 00:37:21,886
is really nicely balanced.

969
00:37:21,888 --> 00:37:23,088
It's smooth.
It's creamy.

970
00:37:23,089 --> 00:37:25,625
It's the right sweetness,
so good.

971
00:37:25,626 --> 00:37:27,826
- Thank you.
- What undid the dessert

972
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,858
for me was actually
the almond crust on the bottom.

973
00:37:30,864 --> 00:37:32,233
- Okay.
- The crust ended up

974
00:37:32,234 --> 00:37:34,767
being a little bit wetter
than I had hoped.

975
00:37:34,768 --> 00:37:36,838
What ends up happening is,
when you have a really fatty,

976
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:39,807
wet dessert on top
of a really fatty, wet crust,

977
00:37:39,808 --> 00:37:41,336
there isn't the differentiation

978
00:37:41,341 --> 00:37:43,641
that you need to really have
the perfect mouth effect.

979
00:37:43,644 --> 00:37:44,844
Okay.

980
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,005
Now comes the hard part.

981
00:37:46,012 --> 00:37:48,548
The judges got to deliberate.

982
00:37:48,549 --> 00:37:50,549
Man, I'm nervous about the cake

983
00:37:50,551 --> 00:37:51,988
not being cooked long enough.

984
00:37:51,989 --> 00:37:54,145
You know, there's
so much at stake.

985
00:37:54,154 --> 00:37:57,194
Winning with this recipe
that has been with me

986
00:37:57,195 --> 00:37:58,758
since I was a child

987
00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:01,637
would be the most special thing
I could even imagine.

988
00:38:01,638 --> 00:38:03,465
I think the flavors are great,

989
00:38:03,469 --> 00:38:06,109
and there's a really
good balance going on.

990
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:10,106
I feel like that
I could possibly win this.

991
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:13,510
Inside this envelope
is the name of the winner,

992
00:38:13,514 --> 00:38:16,949
but before I tell you
who that person is,

993
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:19,018
tell me who you are.

994
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:23,719
Henry, are you
a baker or a faker?

995
00:38:23,724 --> 00:38:29,134
I... am... a...

996
00:38:37,137 --> 00:38:41,467
Henry, are you a baker
or a faker?

997
00:38:41,474 --> 00:38:43,442
I...

998
00:38:43,443 --> 00:38:46,011
am...

999
00:38:46,012 --> 00:38:48,012
a...

1000
00:38:48,014 --> 00:38:49,081
baker.
- Yes!

1001
00:38:49,082 --> 00:38:50,716
- Oh.
- Yes! Oh.

1002
00:38:50,717 --> 00:38:54,186
I am the owner
of Whisk Cake Creations

1003
00:38:54,187 --> 00:38:56,155
in Alameda, California.

1004
00:38:56,156 --> 00:38:57,586
At Whisk Cake Creations,

1005
00:38:57,591 --> 00:39:00,261
we specialize in custom
cakes for all occasions.

1006
00:39:00,262 --> 00:39:02,600
That looks great.

1007
00:39:02,603 --> 00:39:04,713
Through high school,
I worked at different bakeries,

1008
00:39:04,714 --> 00:39:06,365
and I went into culinary school.

1009
00:39:06,372 --> 00:39:09,611
And I've always had this dream
of starting my own business.

1010
00:39:09,612 --> 00:39:12,344
You let us know what you want,
and we can definitely create it.

1011
00:39:12,345 --> 00:39:14,475
The best part of my job
is that I get to do what I love,

1012
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,320
which is making people happy.

1013
00:39:15,321 --> 00:39:16,615
Here you go.

1014
00:39:16,617 --> 00:39:18,477
So it doesn't feel
like a job at all.

1015
00:39:18,484 --> 00:39:19,652
Thank you.

1016
00:39:19,653 --> 00:39:22,163
We know we got
one baker in Henry.

1017
00:39:22,164 --> 00:39:23,555
Michele?
- Yes?

1018
00:39:23,557 --> 00:39:28,487
Tell us, are you a baker
or are you a faker?

1019
00:39:28,494 --> 00:39:32,431
I... am...

1020
00:39:32,432 --> 00:39:33,866
a...

1021
00:39:33,867 --> 00:39:34,937
Baker, baker, baker.

1022
00:39:34,938 --> 00:39:37,995
- ...faker.
- No!

1023
00:39:38,004 --> 00:39:39,605
- What?!
- No way!

1024
00:39:39,606 --> 00:39:41,736
- Yep.
- I don't believe it.

1025
00:39:41,742 --> 00:39:43,475
No.

1026
00:39:43,476 --> 00:39:45,146
Are you faking right now?
Are you really a faker?

1027
00:39:45,147 --> 00:39:47,575
- No, I am truly a faker.
- What's your deal?

1028
00:39:47,581 --> 00:39:49,021
I work for a police department.

1029
00:39:49,022 --> 00:39:51,075
- What?!
- You're a cop?

1030
00:39:51,084 --> 00:39:53,290
I'm not a cop.
I'm a civilian worker,

1031
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:54,586
but I work with the police.

1032
00:39:54,588 --> 00:39:57,788
Yes.
I oversee the civilian side

1033
00:39:57,791 --> 00:40:00,931
of the police department
in Davis, California.

1034
00:40:00,934 --> 00:40:02,668
Davis, 152.

1035
00:40:02,669 --> 00:40:05,139
I've worked at the police
department for 12 years.

1036
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:08,107
We are a family, and a lot of us
grew up together.

1037
00:40:08,108 --> 00:40:10,277
So I'm super proud of being able

1038
00:40:10,278 --> 00:40:12,176
to give back
to the community now.

1039
00:40:12,178 --> 00:40:14,516
I brought you down, so we can
look at a couple camps today.

1040
00:40:14,517 --> 00:40:16,615
I was hoping you guys
can do some medical assessments

1041
00:40:16,617 --> 00:40:18,987
and any other services
that we can provide them.

1042
00:40:18,988 --> 00:40:21,885
I bake cakes for family,
for friends.

1043
00:40:21,888 --> 00:40:24,388
Baking is how I show my love.

1044
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:26,529
I definitely utilize
my baking skills

1045
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:28,596
to get some stuff
done around my work.

1046
00:40:28,597 --> 00:40:30,555
I love going out
into the community

1047
00:40:30,564 --> 00:40:33,274
and really showing
my pride for my city,

1048
00:40:33,275 --> 00:40:35,266
plus the department.

1049
00:40:35,268 --> 00:40:38,507
Well, Jennifer, I guess
we know what that makes you.

1050
00:40:38,508 --> 00:40:40,235
But for the record,
please, tell us.

1051
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,610
Are you a baker or a faker?

1052
00:40:41,611 --> 00:40:45,344
- I am a baker.
- Ah! Ha-ha.

1053
00:40:45,345 --> 00:40:47,075
Where are you a baker, Jennifer?

1054
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:51,216
I'm actually not just a baker,
but I'm an ice-cream maker.

1055
00:40:51,217 --> 00:40:54,017
I am the executive chef
of Local Ice,

1056
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,055
an artisan ice-cream parlor

1057
00:40:56,056 --> 00:40:58,656
in Studio City, California.

1058
00:40:58,659 --> 00:41:01,399
I'm liking how this one looks.
I get to see customers

1059
00:41:01,401 --> 00:41:04,201
come in and taste
the things that I make.

1060
00:41:04,204 --> 00:41:06,672
Mm.
That is delicious.

1061
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:10,309
I get to make something
that makes people happy

1062
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:13,550
because who's in a bad mood
when they eat ice cream?

1063
00:41:15,816 --> 00:41:17,246
I like it.
It looks so good.

1064
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:20,050
So now that we know who you are,

1065
00:41:20,053 --> 00:41:22,588
it's my turn to
reveal the winner.

1066
00:41:22,589 --> 00:41:27,426
Henry, Jennifer, if you win,
you win $10,000.

1067
00:41:27,427 --> 00:41:33,097
And, Michele, if you win,
you win 15 grand.

1068
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,500
The winner is...

1069
00:41:40,674 --> 00:41:41,807
...Michele.

1070
00:41:41,808 --> 00:41:45,044
Whoo!
Yay!

1071
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:46,275
That's awesome.

1072
00:41:46,279 --> 00:41:47,709
Thank you so much.

1073
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:49,920
Honestly, the cupcake
was beautifully baked,

1074
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:51,916
the chocolate, the sweetness
perfectly balanced.

1075
00:41:51,918 --> 00:41:53,248
It felt cohesive.

1076
00:41:53,253 --> 00:41:54,723
It felt like something
I would buy in a bakery.

1077
00:41:54,724 --> 00:41:55,921
Thank you.

1078
00:41:55,922 --> 00:41:57,522
I'm so excited.

1079
00:41:57,524 --> 00:42:00,966
I can't believe I won $15,000.

1080
00:42:00,967 --> 00:42:02,397
This is a dream come true.

1081
00:42:02,402 --> 00:42:05,671
Beating two professionals
at their own game,

1082
00:42:05,672 --> 00:42:07,010
it makes me super proud.

1083
00:42:07,011 --> 00:42:09,837
I can't wait to go back
and share this with my town.

1084
00:42:09,843 --> 00:42:11,412
Thank you.
- Congratulations.

1085
00:42:11,413 --> 00:42:13,180
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1086
00:42:13,181 --> 00:42:14,749
Great work.
Thank you very much.

1087
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:16,318
Thank you.
Great job.
