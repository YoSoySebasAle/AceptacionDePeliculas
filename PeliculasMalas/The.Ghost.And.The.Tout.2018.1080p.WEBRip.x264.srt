1
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:19,583
Girl, you are so lucky.

2
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:20,750
I know, right?

3
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:24,333
- I feel so, so lucky, like...
- Aw.

4
00:00:26,125 --> 00:00:27,458
Oh, my goodness.

5
00:00:27,542 --> 00:00:30,458
It's shiny and all bling-bling and--

6
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:32,250
Oh, talk of the devil.

7
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:34,208
No, talk of the angel.

8
00:00:34,292 --> 00:00:37,000
Oh, okay. Angel.

9
00:00:38,042 --> 00:00:40,000
Sorry, baby, it's Nana.

10
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:42,375
- Hey!
- Hi.

11
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:43,500
Hi!

12
00:00:45,083 --> 00:00:47,542
I know, right?
Is that the way my voice sounds?

13
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:51,917
Okay, okay.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,042
Okay.

15
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,625
Please leave.

16
00:01:17,458 --> 00:01:19,458
Hello? Um, yeah.

17
00:01:19,542 --> 00:01:21,875
- When are we getting married?
- <i>Hello to you.</i>

18
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,458
Look, I don't even have time
for all of this, Kwame.

19
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,833
I asked you a simple question,
so please answer me.

20
00:01:26,917 --> 00:01:29,292
- When are we getting married?
- <i>What do you mean?</i>

21
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:32,458
<i>I remember correctly</i>
<i>that I proposed to you.</i>

22
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,875
Oh, fantastic. Fantastic!

23
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:40,250
Now let me ask you a question.
When did you propose?

24
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:43,292
No, don't answer that question.
2008, right?

25
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:46,208
What year are we in? 2018. Come on!

26
00:01:46,292 --> 00:01:49,583
Kwame, you don't have the fear of God.

27
00:01:49,667 --> 00:01:53,083
So please, I ask you again,
when are we getting married?

28
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:55,167
<i>Is this about your friend getting married?</i>

29
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:59,042
<i>Look, when you get back to Ghana,</i>
<i>we will discuss it.</i>

30
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:01,333
<i>Give me 12 months and we will get married.</i>

31
00:02:01,417 --> 00:02:05,125
Same old story. The same old story!

32
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,542
You've turned me
into the Lord of the Rings.

33
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:10,958
And you keep giving me the same old story.
Let me tell you something, mister.

34
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:13,917
If you do not do the needful,
I will walk away.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,167
You'll be shocked
at my decision. I will walk away. Try me!

36
00:02:37,042 --> 00:02:39,792
Bring back my towel!

37
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:42,125
I will kill somebody when I get there!

38
00:02:46,125 --> 00:02:49,250
Look at me.
You three shouldn't have been born.

39
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,292
Are you laughing at me?

40
00:02:52,375 --> 00:02:55,083
Hey, be careful. Be careful!

41
00:02:58,167 --> 00:03:00,583
Guy, take your towel.

42
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:03,042
Thank you!

43
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,417
God bless you!

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,417
God bless you!

45
00:03:09,417 --> 00:03:11,458
But I told you before.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,750
If you want to bathe,
put your towel on the inside.

47
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:19,375
If I get hold of any of you,
I will deal with you mercilessly.

48
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:20,583
Indomie!

49
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,708
- Me, Indomie?
- Big head!

50
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:25,500
You people are nothing
but circumstances and consequences.

51
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:29,083
I'm sure you don't know anything
about the grammar you're speaking.

52
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:32,792
Hey, leave it. I will kill you today.

53
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,583
Stop running! Hold on!

54
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:47,750
Where are you running?
Hold on. Come here.

55
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,917
This guy. Are you normal? What's wrong?

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,208
Why are you running?
What's wrong with you?

57
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:55,167
You, too. Why are you running?

58
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,500
Are you mad? Please go away!

59
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,583
Why he's running
is what I don't understand.

60
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:02,250
I'm chasing small children.
I'm running after them.

61
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:05,042
You started running with me.
Everybody followed me, too.

62
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,000
- How does my running concern you?
- Allow me to run.

63
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:10,542
This idiot is chasing after kids
on the street.

64
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,917
- Hey, <i>bobo</i>, don't talk too much.
- Are you okay?

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,792
- Hey! Don't talk too much.
- Okay.

66
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,542
Those kids must not escape. Move!

67
00:04:19,625 --> 00:04:22,708
- Today has to be good.
- It has to be.

68
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:24,500
Fortune will smile on us.

69
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:28,000
A miracle will happen soon.

70
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,083
Come here.

71
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,958
Come back here.

72
00:04:32,042 --> 00:04:34,583
- Where are you going?
- I'm off to see a friend.

73
00:04:34,667 --> 00:04:36,917
Honestly, you look like a lunatic.
Kneel down there.

74
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:39,500
He's talking and you are standing.
Kneel down!

75
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,375
Do you realize you're being weird?
See how you're dressed like a girl?

76
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:46,708
Tell me, do you want to mislead young boys
out there with your behavior?

77
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:48,292
You want them to behave like you?

78
00:04:48,792 --> 00:04:50,792
Believe me, you're cursed.

79
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:53,167
Sir, are you cursing her?
Your life isn't ruined.

80
00:04:54,042 --> 00:04:56,458
- Rather, big things will befall you.
- Are you praying for her?

81
00:04:56,542 --> 00:04:58,000
- Yes, of course.
- Okay, go on.

82
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,000
A big vehicle will crush you to death

83
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:04,458
for misleading boys
with your weird lifestyle.

84
00:05:04,542 --> 00:05:06,917
You don't know.
I beg you, in God's name, tell me

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,750
what made you adopt this lifestyle?

86
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:16,458
We both grew up in this neighborhood,
until you suddenly changed.

87
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:20,167
Why did you change suddenly?
What happened to you?

88
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,000
What happened exactly?

89
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,708
Guys,
there's something I don't understand.

90
00:05:23,792 --> 00:05:28,292
I don't know where to start.
Do I address you as a he or a she?

91
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:31,500
Bobo, what do you call yourself?
What's the meaning of all this?

92
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:34,542
We need to stop this weird behavior today.

93
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,500
We need to let him know
she's doing the wrong thing.

94
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:39,750
We have to stop you today.
Today we'll tie you here.

95
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,958
- Ah, no! Forget it.
- We will tie you here!

96
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,708
- Who's this? What happened? Who are you?
- It's me, Isla.

97
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:46,667
- Stop this.
- Is your face on the 1,000-naira bill?

98
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,750
What do you mean "It's Isla"?
We need to deal with him!

99
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,875
- Sit down, sir.
- Don't come here and misbehave.

100
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,625
Don't say that, please. Forget about it.

101
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:56,042
- Once he grows up, he becomes your child.
- Isla.

102
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,625
Isla, I don't like this at all.

103
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,125
Isla, this isn't how things are done.

104
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:01,875
Isla, don't overstep.

105
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,917
- Please be lenient.
- You're getting out of hand.

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,625
Please don't be angry. He's one of us.

107
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:10,708
You're stupid. I will deal with you later.

108
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:13,000
- Isla, this is unacceptable.
- Please.

109
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,375
- Stand up.
- You just came to ruin things for us.

110
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,667
- So you want him to leave?
- No, you know what?

111
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,333
I promise you guys that, after today,
Bobo will not dress like a girl again.

112
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:24,958
Am I lying?
Now tell me, how will you dress?

113
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:29,625
- Like a man.
- The idiot says "like a man."

114
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:30,875
Like a man.

115
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:33,208
Isla, this is unacceptable.

116
00:06:33,292 --> 00:06:34,917
- Let's go.
- Go where?

117
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,667
- What's wrong?
- Things aren't done that way.

118
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,750
- We came here to make money.
- He'll give you money.

119
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,792
- Let him give us money.
- Don't come with that.

120
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,792
We can't take money from this freak.
He shouldn't give us any money.

121
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:46,458
Let her go, please. I said let him go.

122
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:48,292
- Hey, Isla.
- We don't want it!

123
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,917
Isla, we don't need his money.
Go away with your problems.

124
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,167
Go away. We don't want your money!
We're not taking his money.

125
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:58,208
Both of you
should leave this place right now!

126
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:01,792
Isla, you're misbehaving.

127
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:04,917
We need to teach Isla a lesson or two.

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,958
Watch how well I can mimic that guy.
Ask me where I'm going.

129
00:07:09,042 --> 00:07:10,875
- Where are you going?
- To see my friend.

130
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:12,583
Take a look at that!

131
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,667
I can do it, too.

132
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,417
- Now ask me.
- Where are you going?

133
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,292
I'm going to see my friend.

134
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,833
I'm adverse to losing.
My enemy will lose instead.

135
00:07:28,292 --> 00:07:31,458
So this is where you are?
So this is where you are?

136
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:33,667
Eh! You're here!

137
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,667
- This is where you are!
- What's that?

138
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,125
- I've been looking for you!
- Madam, stop!

139
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,000
- I said stop! What's the problem?
- Isla!

140
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,917
It's none of your business.

141
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,500
What's wrong with this one?

142
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,125
- I pity you!
- You and who?

143
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:49,417
- I'm touching you again.
- Ah!

144
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,708
- Did you tell her who I am?
- I did.

145
00:07:51,792 --> 00:07:53,417
- Madam, see.
- Don't interfere!

146
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,917
- Ah!
- Me and you.

147
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,583
- See her now!
- That's what I'm saying.

148
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:59,583
- Tell her again.
- It's none of your business.

149
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:02,292
What do you mean?
I touched you. What are you gonna do?

150
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:07,083
Please, I beg you in the name of God.

151
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:10,708
Anybody that tries to separate us
when we're fighting will be unfortunate.

152
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:13,208
- Where are your people? I pity you!
- I want to kill somebody.

153
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,250
I want to fight you. Yes, I touched you.

154
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,667
- Did you just touch me?
- I touched you. I want to fight you!

155
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,417
- You're touching me?
- Yes! I touched you!

156
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,583
That's it! I told you.

157
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:25,667
- Talk now!
- She's never lost a fight.

158
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,792
Talk now! I'm not hearing you!

159
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,750
- Talk!
- Please.

Auntie, I did not--

It's not like I'm fighting you.
We're friends. We're one family.

- Don't interfere. This is our business.

168
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,167
- I know.
- Do you hear me? Don't ever do it again.

169
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,375
Next time...

170
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,917
- I'll finish you.
- I'm not--

171
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,542
- I just started today.
- I'm sorry, ma.

172
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,708
- She gets it.
- Go home. Now go home quickly.

173
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:11,083
I said to the house.
Go!

174
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,875
I'm already going home.

175
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,833
Monkey. Go away! Nonsense.

176
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:20,250
Dayo, it's okay.
I've told you to stop thanking me.

177
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,208
Ah, let me thank you.

178
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,292
You people should stop!

179
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,708
Isn't that Chioma?

180
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,375
She's the one. It's Chioma.

181
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:40,333
You people should stop! Stop!

182
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:43,542
Stop! Let's go!

183
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:47,833
Stop that car! I said stop that car!
Don't move an inch! Stop!

184
00:09:47,917 --> 00:09:49,833
- Let me go down and beat her!
- Dayo.

185
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:52,292
- Chioma is tough.
- Dayo, listen to me.

186
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,667
- Get out of the car!
- Get out!

187
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,875
- Let me talk to her.
- Okay. All right.

188
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,083
Get out! Get out!

189
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,708
We don't understand English!

190
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:16,625
- I don't listen to trash.
- Calm down.

191
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,750
- Chioma--
- Mike, I beg you.

192
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:26,167
Please stop!

193
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:30,000
Don't talk to me!

194
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:33,208
Tell that man to get out. That's all!
What is it?

195
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,708
- Who died?
- Sir, I don't have time for too much talk.

196
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:41,208
I need to see the idiot
that is inside that car with my man.

197
00:10:41,292 --> 00:10:46,125
I need to see her, disfigure her, disgrace
her and show her I'm a real Igbo girl.

198
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:49,583
Is she crazy? Why would my man
carry another girl inside this car?

199
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:52,042
I'm telling him to open the door.
He has refused.

200
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,917
Don't come near me. I'm mad!

201
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,750
Open this door!

202
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,167
Okay.

203
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,792
Open this door!
I'm going to strip naked right here!

204
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,833
- Okay!
- Let him open the door!

205
00:11:02,917 --> 00:11:04,125
- Okay.
- Let us see the girl!

206
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,792
- You want me to take my clothes off?
- No.

207
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,417
Okay, he will open the door.
He will open the door.

208
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,667
Quickly!

209
00:11:10,292 --> 00:11:13,417
- Open it! Open the door!
- I want to see the girl inside.

210
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,625
I want to see who my man
has been sleeping with.

211
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,417
I want to see her!

212
00:11:20,417 --> 00:11:23,167
The girl will die today! Open the door!

213
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,333
Chioma, wait.

214
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:26,875
It's okay.

215
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,875
- Did you see anybody there?
- Dayo!

216
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,042
- No! It's my turn!
- Dayo.

217
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:38,542
- Did you see anybody there? Chioma.
- It's okay.

218
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:41,708
- Stop playing the victim!
- All of you are mad!

219
00:11:41,792 --> 00:11:43,458
What if you dropped her off somewhere?

220
00:11:43,542 --> 00:11:45,875
Dayo!

221
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:47,500
Dayo, you can't do anything!

222
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:51,208
Brother Dayo,
we speak the same language. Let's talk.

223
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:55,083
Dayo, if you kill people--

224
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:56,542
- Get in!
- Don't test me!

225
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:59,667
- Beg him!
- Beg him for what? Forget about it!

226
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,792
You don't know
if he dropped the girl off already.

227
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,833
- Do you think you can outsmart me?
- Who's talking about being smart?

228
00:12:09,917 --> 00:12:12,708
- You're trying to--
- We're talking about fairness!

229
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:17,125
I bought a business.
I want to take 60 %, you 40 %.

230
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,542
What is not fair about it?

231
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,667
- Emeka?
- Obanikoro!

232
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,083
Do you know your problem?

233
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:23,417
Let me hear you!

234
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,333
Self-centeredness.

235
00:12:25,417 --> 00:12:27,708
And your own is greed!

236
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:31,333
- Obanikoro, you're too greedy!
- I see.

237
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,375
Be contented with 40!

238
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,333
How do you mean I should be contented?

239
00:12:35,417 --> 00:12:38,208
- After all the things I've done for you!
- What did you do for me?

240
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:39,458
I brought you to Lagos.

241
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:40,917
- You brought who?
- You!

242
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,042
Stop lying! I knew the way to Lagos.
I came on my own.

243
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:48,000
You, a bush boy?
You came to Lagos by yourself?

244
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,083
- You're calling me a bush boy?
- You are a bush boy!

245
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:52,542
- How do I look? How do you look?
- I'll show you what I'm made of!

246
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,708
- I'm a smart fellow!
- Oh, that's good.

247
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:56,458
- Trim!
- I will never take that!

248
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,125
- Edible! Eh?
- Okay.

249
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:02,000
He who lives by the sword
will die by the sword.

250
00:13:02,083 --> 00:13:04,292
- Back to sender.
- See, eh?

251
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,708
- Stop your greed and grow.
- Look, look.

252
00:13:06,792 --> 00:13:08,208
- I'm growing.
- Okay.

253
00:13:08,292 --> 00:13:10,292
Look at the beautiful office
I have here.

254
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:12,958
I'm growing. Everyone is.
I am growing.

255
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,083
You are not growing because of your greed!

256
00:13:15,167 --> 00:13:19,125
- Have you been to my office recently?
- Which office?

257
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,542
- Where goats are slaughtered?
- You're a fool! A big one!

258
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:22,833
What is going on here?

259
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:25,833
Good. Thank goodness your son is here.

260
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:29,625
Now tell me, do you still want
to display your stupidity?

261
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:33,583
I'm going to call your own son
and tell him how stupid you are.

262
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:36,375
You've been idiotic
since your secondary school days.

263
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:37,458
Let me call your son.

264
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:39,208
- Please, sir.
- You are done for!

265
00:13:39,292 --> 00:13:40,792
Both of you need to take it easy.

266
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,000
Take what easy?

267
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,917
Take what easy? This man is greedy.

268
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,875
How could I have bought a business
wanting to take 60 %, him 40?

269
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:54,000
He's insisting on 50-50! Is it done?

270
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,500
I won't stay here
and listen to this rubbish of yours.

271
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:01,750
He who lives by the sword
will die by the sword.

272
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:04,958
I'll cut you from the left and right side.

273
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:10,375
I'll cut your private parts
into several pieces.

274
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,875
- Yellow monkey! Leave me alone!
- So you are running.

275
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,375
- Please...
- Please what?

276
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:17,708
Oh, you're going?
You see? It's like they say--

277
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:22,125
"When the fowl messes up,
the land pursues the fowl."

278
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:26,125
- Do you know, this matches the box...
- You know the fowl?

279
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,500
...you'll use to take your stuff
back to your village.

280
00:14:28,583 --> 00:14:33,792
- Each time the fowl farts.
- I'll force you to walk on your head.

281
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:38,167
Eat shit
and fill your mouth with it, then vomit.

282
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,833
- Leave me.
- Let him go. Greedy man!

283
00:14:40,917 --> 00:14:43,000
- Hallelujah!
- Vamoose!

284
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,042
Disappear! Look at him walking--

285
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,708
Hey! Come back here!

286
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:50,583
- Where are you going?
- I'm going after him, of course.

287
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:52,708
Obinna, you're stupid.

288
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:54,583
You want to sabotage me.

289
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:57,167
- You want to stab me from the back.
- Daddy, please stop this talk.

290
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,042
<i>Et tu, Brute? Et tu, Brute?</i>

291
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,625
- I'll be back.
- If you leave--

292
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,875
Who is it?

293
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,750
Oh, Janet.

294
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,750
- Hello.
- Abisola.

295
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:14,250
- Good to see you.
- How are you?

296
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm fine. I'm good.

297
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,167
- How you doing?
- I'm fine.

298
00:15:19,792 --> 00:15:22,000
- What's wrong with your AC?
- Don't mind it.

299
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:23,375
It stopped working,

300
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:26,042
- but we'll be fixing it later today.
- Okay.

301
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,708
Is Dora home?

302
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:30,125
Yes, but I think she's sleeping.

303
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:33,833
- No, you don't have to wake her.
- Okay.

304
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:37,375
Please, can you give this to her?

305
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,333
- Thank you.
- So, what is this?

306
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:41,958
It's a wedding invite.

307
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:43,167
Okay.

308
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,417
Mike is getting married.

309
00:15:46,917 --> 00:15:49,083
- Mike is getting married?
- Mm-hmm.

310
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:52,625
- And this is for Dora?
- Yes.

311
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:56,667
I think you should hold on.
She should be awake.

312
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,167
Are you sure you want to wake her up?
I'm coming, please.

313
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,292
Okay.

314
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:07,917
Oh, there you are, Dora!
How are you doing? What's up?

315
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,208
What are you doing here?

316
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,375
What right do you think you have
to be here?

317
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:13,792
Uh... what did I do?

318
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:14,875
What did you not do?

319
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,167
If you weren't such a bad,
self-centered friend,

320
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,833
wouldn't you ask me what happened
between your brother and me?

321
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:23,042
Is it a crime to be here?

322
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,208
I just don't want you to hear it
from anyone else.

323
00:16:25,292 --> 00:16:26,625
I wanted to tell you myself.

324
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:29,083
Please, let's calm down, please.

325
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:31,000
If Janet is not crazy,

326
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,708
she won't sit there talking to me
about Mike's wedding.

327
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,750
What kind of callous behavior is that?

328
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,458
Wait, what do you mean by crazy?

329
00:16:37,542 --> 00:16:39,250
Huh?

330
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:42,000
Didn't you tell me
you had gotten over my brother?

331
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:43,333
Didn't you tell me that?

332
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:47,833
Really? If you are not crazy,
you and your family used me.

333
00:16:47,917 --> 00:16:49,167
You deceived me!

334
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,750
Used... you?

335
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:54,583
Wait, can you just take a split second

336
00:16:54,667 --> 00:16:58,333
to listen to what exactly
you just said now? You--

337
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,125
You know what?

338
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:02,750
It's pointless.

339
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:04,875
I really shouldn't be here.

340
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:07,042
I'm sorry I came.
I should take my leave now.

341
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:09,083
Better. Hey and you know what?

342
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:11,708
Don't you ever come to my house again.

343
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,792
Ungrateful bunch.

344
00:17:16,917 --> 00:17:18,333
- Can you imagine?
- It's unbelievable.

345
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,917
It's okay.

346
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:28,208
- See my baby!
- Oshey Baddest!

347
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:29,708
See my baby!

348
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:32,667
- You can keep the change.
- Stop giving these bikers money.

349
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,125
- Alausa!
- You want to collect money?

350
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,500
It's okay. Let him be. I gave it to him.

351
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:39,917
- Stop giving bike riders money.
- I gave it to him.

352
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,958
- Today is a good day.
- Baby, what's going on?

353
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:44,083
- Don't do that again.
- It's okay.

354
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:45,667
- Are you guys doing okay?
- Yes, we are.

355
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,792
- You guys are doing good.
- Baby, what's going on?

356
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,542
- You know me now.
- I can see you're happy.

357
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:53,208
Nkemjika is always latest.

358
00:17:53,292 --> 00:17:54,500
- Always latest.
- That's right!

359
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:57,417
- Tell me something.
- I bought an iPhone 7.

360
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,708
I said it.

361
00:17:58,792 --> 00:18:01,042
- IPhone 7s.
- IPhone 7s?

362
00:18:01,125 --> 00:18:03,125
- Yes. Latest.
- Can I see it?

363
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,833
- Latest!
- IPhone 7s!

364
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:07,583
Just flash me.

365
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:08,833
- Yes!
- Wait.

366
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:12,375
So, me, I'm gonna shine.
Come over.

367
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,750
You know what?
You're buying me drinks to celebrate.

368
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:18,042
- No problem. Come. I'm going to the club.
- Okay, let's go there.

369
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,875
Nkemjika bought a new phone!

370
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:24,833
Nkemjika bought a new phone!
Let me even take off my slippers.

371
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:28,792
Nkemjika bought a new phone!

372
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,125
Nkemjika bought an iPhone 10!

373
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,750
Everybody, Nkemjika bought a new phone!

374
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,167
- Auntie!
- Yes?

375
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,583
Auntie, Ejika has bought iPhone 10.

376
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:44,458
- Ejika bought what?
- IPhone 10.

377
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:47,208
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

378
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,583
- Did you see it?
- Yes!

379
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:49,833
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

380
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:51,083
- Say "Allah."
- Allah.

381
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:53,292
Ah! I'm coming!

382
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:55,375
- Where are you going?
- I want to go and meet Ejika.

383
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:58,833
- But I said I miss you.
- Forget about love. This is important.

384
00:18:58,917 --> 00:19:01,500
- Ejika has bought iPhone 10!
- Come now.

385
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,125
Ejika has bought iPhone 10!

386
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:06,625
Alausa, how many will you drink?
Two bottles?

387
00:19:06,708 --> 00:19:09,125
- Yes, I'll drink two.
- Bring two bottles.

388
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:10,708
How many will you drink?

389
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,500
Eh? Ramotu.

390
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,125
Wait, my friend.
I heard you bought an iPhone 10.

391
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,958
Phone. I'm buying drinks for everyone.

392
00:19:18,917 --> 00:19:21,375
Drink up!

393
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:24,833
Nkemjika has bought a phone!

394
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:30,042
Aren't you gonna drink gin
to feel all right?

395
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,083
I'll drink it later. I'm okay for now.

396
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:36,167
What is it?

397
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,208
- Hey, bartender!
- What?

398
00:19:39,292 --> 00:19:41,750
- Get us some drinks over here!
- I'll get them.

399
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,083
I'll get them,
but we want to see the phone first.

400
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:46,833
- You want to see the phone?
- I want to see this particular phone.

401
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:49,083
- 5,005-naira phone!
- Open the phone!

402
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,375
IPhone 10.

403
00:19:54,542 --> 00:19:56,958
- Nkemjika. Let's see.
- Calm down, everybody.

404
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:08,625
- Drink up! The phone is here!
- Switch the phone on.

405
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:12,875
Once I switch on this phone,
I'll call Ibrahim.

406
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,667
No, Buhari.

407
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,958
One straight call.
This phone does not need to be charged.

408
00:20:19,042 --> 00:20:21,167
For real!

409
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,125
It doesn't need charging at all. Yes!

410
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,917
- IPhone.
- It cannot die!

411
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,792
Are they seeing you in America?

412
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,542
- I don't understand.
- It isn't switching on?

413
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,917
- Wait!
- No, press it well.

414
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,417
The phone that can call Buhari,
is it going to come on easily?

415
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,292
- No.
- Too much load.

416
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,083
- Let me help you.
- The battery's dead.

417
00:20:41,167 --> 00:20:43,042
- Press it well.
- IPhone 10!

418
00:20:43,917 --> 00:20:46,167
Wait, it's this side.

419
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,333
Okay, that's it.

420
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,625
- Leave it alone!
- Wait!

421
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,583
Wait, you did not put the SIM card in.

422
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:00,500
- Let me put the SIM in.
- No wonder!

423
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,958
Yeah, that's it.

424
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:05,042
- Now put the SIM in.
- Gently.

425
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:11,000
IPhone. Good iPhone.

426
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:17,667
This is real gold.

427
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:24,625
- Cassava meal!
- And the thing go skrra!

428
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:39,417
I'm too stunned to speak.

429
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:45,917
Don't open the drinks!

430
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,500
- This one?
- Please, let's go!

431
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:49,833
- Don't open it!
- Don't open what?

432
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:52,708
- Look what she bought for 5,500 naira.
- She bought it. So what?

433
00:21:52,792 --> 00:21:54,458
- Look what she got for 5,500.
- IPhone 10!

434
00:21:54,542 --> 00:21:56,000
Don't open the drinks!

435
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,250
Don't open what?

436
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,583
- Please leave!
- IPhone!

437
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:07,958
Hi, Mum.

438
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,042
Mummy, I'm greeting you.

439
00:22:11,667 --> 00:22:14,208
Is that how I taught you to greet?

440
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:15,833
Is that how I raised you?

441
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:21,125
Good day, ma.

442
00:22:22,083 --> 00:22:23,500
Welcome.

443
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:28,042
- Why are you frowning?
- Dora again.

444
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:29,625
What happened to Dora?

445
00:22:29,708 --> 00:22:32,083
So I went to Dora's house
to invite her to Mike's wedding.

446
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:34,208
Dora almost beat me up.

447
00:22:34,292 --> 00:22:38,250
I mean, you needed to see the way--
the bad things she said about us!

448
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,000
It just took me the grace, like--

449
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:44,833
the last strength in me
to just walk away without hitting her.

450
00:22:44,917 --> 00:22:45,958
You know what I think?

451
00:22:46,042 --> 00:22:47,833
I think it was a bad idea.

452
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,375
You shouldn't have gone to invite her.

453
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:54,875
Clearly, that young woman
is not over your brother.

454
00:22:55,417 --> 00:23:01,042
But I must commend you for not slapping
or abusing or fighting her.

455
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:02,250
I didn't.

456
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:03,667
Shows I taught you well.

457
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:08,125
Sorry. You should go
and talk to your brother about it, okay?

458
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:09,583
I will.

459
00:23:09,667 --> 00:23:13,458
Mummy, why are you the one cooking?
Where's the housemaid?

460
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:16,583
House girl. Who's the house girl?

461
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:17,917
The house girl.

462
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
The house girl, she doesn't have a name?

463
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:23,042
She doesn't have a name? "The housemaid."

464
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,250
Okay, where is Binta?

465
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:29,625
Better. You should respect people. Hmm?

466
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,583
I sent her down the road
to go and buy me something.

467
00:23:32,667 --> 00:23:36,042
- Sorry, dear, are you going to eat?
- Mummy, I'm so hungry.

468
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:38,250
Don't worry. It'll be ready soon.

469
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:44,375
So, tomorrow morning, Jide and Bimpe,
you will go to Abuja for that meeting.

470
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:46,875
Take everything you need to take.

471
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,083
Don't tell me there's a mistake.

472
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,125
Is that okay?

473
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:53,417
Chioma, you'll take over
their responsibilities.

474
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,458
You'll do all their work tomorrow.

475
00:23:56,917 --> 00:23:57,917
Any questions?

476
00:23:59,042 --> 00:24:00,042
Are you sure?

477
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,125
Ask your questions now.

478
00:24:04,583 --> 00:24:05,583
Dayo.

479
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:07,542
Dayo.

480
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,625
Dayo.

481
00:24:10,417 --> 00:24:13,750
- Ah, sorry.
- Are you okay?

482
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:16,000
I'm sorry. I think away a little.

483
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:18,875
- Okay, you zoned out?
- Uh, yes.

484
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:23,792
Before I get zoned out from
a husband-to-be position to a friend zone,

485
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:26,417
we need to go pick up the girls
for a fitting.

486
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,167
Can we? Have you finished here?

487
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:31,000
Yes. But I need to tidy up some things.

488
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:32,917
Let me go and warm up the car.

489
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,917
Hello, babes.

490
00:25:04,542 --> 00:25:06,458
I couldn't even see him.

491
00:25:08,292 --> 00:25:12,500
I am not going to go explain myself
to someone who has refused to see me.

492
00:25:13,417 --> 00:25:16,833
Hold on! You know what?
Allow me to do this in my own way.

493
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:18,625
I am serious.

494
00:25:19,958 --> 00:25:23,792
You know what? I'm so done.
Like, I'm done.

495
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:27,167
I've fixed this tire
more than 500 times.

496
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:32,000
Sir, please attend to us.
Pump up our tire. We need to leave.

497
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:35,750
I'm sorry for the delay, sir.

498
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:38,875
Please fix it quickly. You're delaying me.

499
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:42,292
Are you going to fix my tire?

500
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,792
Leave the road, sir.

501
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:47,958
What's your problem?
You need to leave the road.

502
00:25:48,042 --> 00:25:49,667
What's going on?

503
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,292
- What do you mean "leave the road?"
- If you're not ready, get out of the way.

504
00:25:52,375 --> 00:25:55,750
I came here before you to get my tire
pumped and you're telling me to leave?

505
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:57,708
- Who do you think I am?
- Who do you think we are?

506
00:25:57,792 --> 00:25:59,458
- Who are you?
- Do you know who we are?

507
00:25:59,542 --> 00:26:01,458
Who are you?

508
00:26:01,542 --> 00:26:04,583
- What is wrong with this man?
- I'm here. I want to pump my tire.

509
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:06,375
- You are where?
- You're telling me--

510
00:26:06,458 --> 00:26:08,708
- Look at this man!
- Let's take it easy!

511
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:18,000
Are you all crazy?
Get in the car. Let's leave!

512
00:26:18,667 --> 00:26:20,792
- You've killed him!
- Dayo!

513
00:26:20,875 --> 00:26:22,375
Hold it!

514
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:24,750
- You've killed him!
- Come on, Dayo.

515
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,917
- He's dead!
- Dayo! Come on!

516
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,417
Yeah, I love you. It's not that serious.

517
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,000
You don't have to come.

518
00:26:38,917 --> 00:26:43,583
No, I don't know them.
And certainly we didn't hit them.

519
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:47,958
I mean, I think they just decided
to act like a nuisance.

520
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:53,708
- Let me call you back.
- Michael, come on! Where is my boyfriend?

521
00:26:53,792 --> 00:26:55,667
And that girl you said
he had an accident with.

522
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:58,750
- Where are they? I want to see my man now!
- Yes!

523
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:01,875
I want to see my man right now!

524
00:27:01,958 --> 00:27:07,042
Where's my man and the stupid girl
he's been cruising around town with?

525
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,375
Chioma, which girl?

526
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:12,917
You're asking me? Don't ask me that!

527
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,583
Didn't you tell me on the phone

528
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:20,375
that my man was involved in an accident
with another woman?

529
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:23,125
Chioma, is that what you deducted
from our conversation?

530
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:26,500
I didn't come here to do mathematics.
I don't know what you're talking about.

531
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:29,042
I want to see my man!

532
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:39,708
Chioma, I said someone tried
to hit my head with a plank.

533
00:27:39,792 --> 00:27:41,208
Dayo saved me.

534
00:27:41,792 --> 00:27:45,083
Girls, calm down.

535
00:27:45,625 --> 00:27:47,167
Mr. Mike, explain.

536
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,792
Let me understand, because
I don't understand what you're saying.

537
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:56,083
I said someone tried
to hit my head with a plank.

538
00:27:56,167 --> 00:27:59,042
Dayo took the hit for me.

539
00:27:59,125 --> 00:28:03,500
Really? Hold on, let me get this clearly.

540
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:06,958
- So no girl?
- There is no girl anywhere.

541
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:13,833
Hold on. So someone wanted to hit you,
you got out of the way,

542
00:28:13,917 --> 00:28:17,917
my man became your personal Lord
and Savior and took the hit for you?

543
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:24,500
Hey! My man is a superhero!
He's a superhero!

544
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,750
You're not cheering me enough.

545
00:28:37,292 --> 00:28:39,125
Yes? Come in.

546
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,708
Hey, brother.

547
00:28:43,792 --> 00:28:47,000
- Janet.
- Husband-to-be in the building.

548
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:48,792
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't shut your door.

549
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:51,083
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

550
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:52,458
Good, good.

551
00:28:52,542 --> 00:28:56,917
- How are you doing? Can I sit?
- Yeah, sit. It's okay.

552
00:28:57,542 --> 00:28:59,792
- So, how you doing?
- I'm good.

553
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:01,125
How is Adunni?

554
00:29:03,292 --> 00:29:05,458
Look at you, you're blushing.

555
00:29:07,625 --> 00:29:08,750
She's fine.

556
00:29:09,917 --> 00:29:15,417
Um...
so I came to discuss something with you.

557
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,500
Okay.

558
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,667
I'm not happy.

559
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:23,500
I'm not happy at all.

560
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:25,250
What happened?

561
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:29,542
I went to Dora's house
to invite her to your wedding.

562
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:35,167
I didn't quite envisage the kind of insult
she rained on me.

563
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:38,250
It was terrible!

564
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:43,750
Okay, so, bro, this is me asking you...

565
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:49,417
...what exactly happened
between the two of you?

566
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,542
Are you kidding me?

567
00:30:25,708 --> 00:30:26,708
No.

568
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,083
That's what happened.

569
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:31,708
And apparently...

570
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:39,083
that was not her first time.

571
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:44,375
Wait.

572
00:30:44,458 --> 00:30:47,000
So, why did she make it look
as if you just dumped her

573
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:48,708
for practically no reason?

574
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,542
It's okay.

575
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,667
No, it's fine.
At least now I know the truth.

576
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:03,542
If you're comfortable lying

577
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:06,292
to the one person
you claim to love so much...

578
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:09,750
then you're capable of doing so much more.

579
00:31:12,125 --> 00:31:13,667
I said leave me alone.

580
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,625
- Don't leave me like this.
- Leave me alone.

581
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:19,208
We've started already. Let's finish.

582
00:31:19,292 --> 00:31:21,875
Finish what? I'm not interested.
And I have my reason.

583
00:31:21,958 --> 00:31:25,583
- Oh, God! I'm full. I need to unload.
- Reloaded, my foot.

584
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:27,625
- I'm going to leave now.
- Please don't go!

585
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:29,708
Don't you know that Oro is tonight?

586
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:33,125
- And so?
- There are masquerades outside! Isla!

587
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:35,417
I've warned you,
women must stay inside tonight.

588
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,458
I've told you! I've told you not to leave!

589
00:31:38,542 --> 00:31:41,042
If you run into any masquerades,
you're on your own!

590
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:45,458
...the strongest of them
all. There's no bird like the vulture.

591
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:53,458
Let her be. Don't pursue her.
Let's continue our rites.

592
00:31:53,542 --> 00:31:58,167
Kafila, open the door! What's wrong?

593
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,250
- Open up! The masquerades!
- Where?

594
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:02,542
Calm down!

595
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:05,750
- Where did you see the masquerades?
- I ran into them.

596
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:11,875
This prophet we came to see
is spirit-filled.

597
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:17,167
All his predictions are accurate.
Believe me.

598
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,875
I'm afraid. But wait. Doesn't the ground
look like it's moving backwards?

599
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:23,667
- What is going backwards?
- This ground.

600
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,833
It's not going anywhere. It's there.

601
00:32:25,917 --> 00:32:27,375
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

602
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:29,417
May the Lord be with you both.

603
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,875
Amen.

604
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:32,875
- God be with you.
- Amen.

605
00:32:32,958 --> 00:32:34,125
You see...

606
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:40,000
Father, leave me alone. Leave me alone.

607
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:43,167
Yes, I'm speaking.

608
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:48,250
Young lady, the forces confronting you
are very powerful.

609
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:49,792
Yes.

610
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:52,042
Sir, I ran into some masquerades

611
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:53,917
and I've had nightmares since.

612
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,417
Excuse me, sir.
She didn't just run into the masquerades.

613
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,083
She saw them face-to-face.

614
00:32:58,167 --> 00:33:00,167
The masquerade was looking at her,

615
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,250
- and she was looking at the masquerade.
- Oh, my God!

616
00:33:02,333 --> 00:33:03,375
It was looking at her,

617
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:05,708
- and she was looking at the masquerade.
- Yes?

618
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:08,583
Excuse me, sir. It's not a small issue.

619
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:12,708
Look, I got the revelation
just as you narrated.

620
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:18,125
It's a bad omen

621
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:21,750
to see a masquerade face-to-face.

622
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:26,292
One has to be prayerful
to avoid negative consequences.

623
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,625
Oh!

624
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:35,125
This is a list of things you need
to get done as soon as possible.

625
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,333
That's what I said.

626
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:39,833
- Cows? Four cows?
- That's right.

627
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:43,625
- Ten lizard eyes.
- That's right.

628
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:47,083
- Red oil, eight gallons.
- Yes. Thus says the Lord.

629
00:33:47,167 --> 00:33:50,042
- Sparrow eggs, 24.
- Thus says the Lord.

630
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:53,792
White fabric, 45 yards.
Are you planning a birthday?

631
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:56,500
Not at all.
It's to fight the forces fighting you.

632
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:58,042
You are insane.

633
00:33:58,125 --> 00:34:00,625
You call this holy ground?
Holy ground, my foot.

634
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:04,750
- You're not allowed to wear shoes here.
- I don't give a damn. I'm out of here.

635
00:34:04,833 --> 00:34:06,542
Look here! Look here!

636
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:08,583
Leave me alone, please!

637
00:34:08,667 --> 00:34:09,917
Look here! Look here!

638
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,417
It's dangerous to change your mind
on this holy ground.

639
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,667
Yes, sir.

640
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,375
Tell her the consequences of disobedience.

641
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:19,583
It's an abomination! That's what I said.

642
00:34:20,375 --> 00:34:23,375
She has to get everything on this list
for her own good.

643
00:34:23,458 --> 00:34:26,042
- Take it.
- Yes, sir.

644
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:27,833
- Oh, Father!
- Thank you, sir.

645
00:34:27,917 --> 00:34:29,667
Leave me. Leave me, Father.

646
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,083
Excuse me, sir.

647
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,750
- I saw an iPhone 6s on this list.
- Yes.

648
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:39,333
It's a bad thing if I can't call you
because I don't have a phone.

649
00:34:39,417 --> 00:34:42,833
So sad. There's nothing sadder than that.

650
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:46,542
The iPhone 6s also has a big screen

651
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:51,125
that will allow me to see clearly
when I call you.

652
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,833
My glasses are broken.

653
00:34:54,917 --> 00:35:01,917
My associates may not be here
when I need to call you,

654
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,208
and that's not good.

655
00:35:03,292 --> 00:35:06,750
The Lord is waiting for you.
Don't disobey divine instruction.

656
00:35:06,833 --> 00:35:08,375
Please, this is important.

657
00:35:09,083 --> 00:35:14,208
The Lord be with you.
In Jesus' name, amen.

658
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:19,875
An opportunity to make money has come.
I need to be prayerful.

659
00:35:19,958 --> 00:35:26,042
You are a child of God and fight
like Anthony Joshua. Superhero!

660
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:28,792
You know what? I love you so much, Dayo.

661
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:30,625
You're my man. Kiss me.

662
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:32,250
- I'm not going to kiss you.
- Why?

663
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:34,583
- You're troublesome. Chioma, what is it?
- What do you mean?

664
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:37,625
My friend, will you shut up and kiss me?
Please peck me!

665
00:35:37,708 --> 00:35:40,625
Uh-uh. This is not a fight.
We're not fighting.

666
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:44,500
Do it romantically. It's my right.

667
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:48,375
Tell me you love me.

668
00:35:48,458 --> 00:35:49,958
- I love--
- I love you, too.

669
00:35:50,042 --> 00:35:51,042
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

670
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:56,833
All right, guys, as much as I would like
Dayo to come home,

671
00:35:56,917 --> 00:35:59,958
we have a wedding to organize.

672
00:36:00,042 --> 00:36:02,125
- Yes.
- May we all fall in love.

673
00:36:02,208 --> 00:36:03,792
You two just want to get married.

674
00:36:04,583 --> 00:36:08,292
I'm sorry, but I'm not sorry.
I can't wait.

675
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:11,292
I called them.
We have to be at 2207 for our fittings.

676
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:13,417
- Yeah, yeah.
- So we have to go.

677
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,750
What about me?

678
00:36:14,833 --> 00:36:18,625
Don't worry, I already told him.
He's coming here specially to suit you up.

679
00:36:18,708 --> 00:36:20,833
What do you mean by "What about me?"

680
00:36:20,917 --> 00:36:23,625
So if she didn't tell you,
you wouldn't know you need bed rest?

681
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:26,417
You need to stay here and rest
so you can recover fully.

682
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,042
And you're saying "What about me?"
Respect yourself. Don't say that again.

683
00:36:30,125 --> 00:36:32,833
- Please.
- What do you mean by that?

684
00:36:32,917 --> 00:36:35,958
Chioma, I know what's good for me
and I know my rights.

685
00:36:36,042 --> 00:36:37,750
I'm sorry.
You don't know what's good for you.

686
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:40,458
I'm here to teach you what's good for you
because you're my man.

687
00:36:40,542 --> 00:36:43,667
- Mike, please can you just do me a favor?
- What's that?

688
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:46,667
Help me tell the doctor that I want to be
the only one in this room.

689
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:49,875
- Yes, with your baby.
- No, no, no. Not with her.

690
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,250
- So you want me to leave?
- Please.

691
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:56,208
You're dreaming. Your name is Joseph.
You can relax.

692
00:36:56,292 --> 00:36:58,208
- I think that will be our cue to go.
- Yeah.

693
00:36:58,292 --> 00:37:01,667
Congratulations, my dear.
I'm going to join your bridal train.

694
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,208
- Yeah. Okay, fine.
- I will come.

695
00:37:03,292 --> 00:37:04,833
- Thank you very much.
- Get well soon.

696
00:37:04,917 --> 00:37:06,208
- Chioma.
- Thank you very much.

697
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:08,083
- Take it easy.
- Take care. Later, okay?

698
00:37:08,167 --> 00:37:11,333
My dear, hold onto your man.
Don't let these street girls steal him.

699
00:37:11,417 --> 00:37:13,500
- Stop shouting.
- Let me talk to my fellow woman.

700
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:18,958
Oh, my God.

701
00:37:21,917 --> 00:37:23,792
Hello? What do you want?

702
00:37:26,417 --> 00:37:27,792
Kill the three.

703
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:32,833
Kill all three!

704
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,208
Kill the three!

705
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:42,875
Okay.

706
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,958
Careful. Drive careful.

707
00:38:11,042 --> 00:38:12,833
- Honey, don't go out!
- Oh, my God!

708
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,333
Oh, my God!

709
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:25,625
- Somebody help!
- Help me!

710
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,833
Call the boss.
Tell him the job's done

711
00:38:40,917 --> 00:38:42,542
and ask him what we should do next.

712
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:52,792
Call this guy, please.

713
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:55,458
Call and tell them
we've killed two people.

714
00:38:57,958 --> 00:38:59,792
This guy isn't answering.

715
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:01,375
Hello, boss.

716
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:03,042
Something just happened right now.

717
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:04,750
Yes, we're good to go.

718
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:08,250
The job is still in motion.
We could only take out just one of them.

719
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:10,458
Boss, calm down. The place was rowdy.

720
00:39:10,542 --> 00:39:12,167
We're still hunting.

721
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,708
Are you with--

722
00:39:15,875 --> 00:39:18,958
- What happened?
- Guess what. He just ended the call.

723
00:39:19,042 --> 00:39:20,417
What did he say?

724
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:25,083
- He's angry.
- From day one, I told you how he'd react.

725
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:27,083
Next one, we'll make it up.

726
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:29,042
Let's finish it up. Come on!

727
00:40:21,875 --> 00:40:23,708
What is it?

728
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:28,417
I told you it's all right.

729
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:42,375
No, you don't understand.

730
00:40:42,458 --> 00:40:45,167
- I need to see my friend.
- No, no, no.

731
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,250
I need to see my friend!

732
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,542
- Mr. Dayo, calm down.
- Ah!

733
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:52,542
I'm in trouble!

734
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:56,042
He's my helper, my assistance. He's Mike!

735
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:57,292
Mike cannot die!

736
00:40:57,375 --> 00:41:00,042
Adunni, what are you going to eat?

737
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:08,625
I don't want to eat.

738
00:41:08,708 --> 00:41:13,417
Adunni, no, don't be like this.
Please, you have to eat some--

739
00:41:21,417 --> 00:41:24,792
Okay, Adunni, do you want me to leave?

740
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:27,583
I'm going to prepare
anything that you want.

741
00:41:27,667 --> 00:41:29,583
- Anything at all.
- I don't want to eat.

742
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:32,042
Please, do you want me to leave?

743
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,250
Don't cry.

744
00:41:36,583 --> 00:41:38,250
Just let me know--

745
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,875
Okay, let me just get you a drink.

746
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:48,917
I'll be right back.

747
00:42:07,042 --> 00:42:08,250
Yeah, hello?

748
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:13,833
You have been trying to reach me
since yesterday,

749
00:42:13,917 --> 00:42:15,417
and it hasn't been going through.

750
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:19,042
Does that make any sense to you?
I didn't ask you to take it this far!

751
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,750
No, I didn't ask you to take it this far!

752
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,375
Look, you know what?

753
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:27,500
I'll call you much later when I'm done

754
00:42:27,583 --> 00:42:29,458
so I can know how to get you
out of this mess.

755
00:42:29,542 --> 00:42:31,250
'Cause I don't know
what you want me to do.

756
00:42:32,708 --> 00:42:34,042
Okay, fine.

757
00:42:42,542 --> 00:42:45,375
Okay, Jane, thank you very much
for the condolences.

758
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:47,083
Thank you so much.

759
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,292
- It's lovely to see you. Thank you.
- All right.

760
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:52,167
- Greet your people.
- Have a lovely evening.

761
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:55,667
Um, sir, sorry.
Can I just have you for one moment?

762
00:42:56,583 --> 00:42:58,458
There's something
that's been playing on my mind

763
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:02,125
and I just wanted to talk to you
now I have the chance and it's very quiet.

764
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:05,208
Basically,
you know my boss isn't aware

765
00:43:05,292 --> 00:43:08,208
- that I understand Yoruba?
- Mm-hmm.

766
00:43:08,292 --> 00:43:11,125
The other day,
I overheard a phone conversation,

767
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:14,167
and I kept hearing
"<i>pa meta, pa meta, pa meta</i>."

768
00:43:14,667 --> 00:43:16,375
And I know it means three.

769
00:43:16,958 --> 00:43:20,333
I believe I heard there were three people
in that car, sir.

770
00:43:20,417 --> 00:43:23,583
Stop crying, stop.

771
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,958
I know you're only doing your job, DPO.

772
00:43:36,625 --> 00:43:37,917
I'm still in shock

773
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,833
that he accused me of killing his son
that I practically raised.

774
00:43:42,667 --> 00:43:46,042
Ask this foolish man
who brought him to Lagos?

775
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:48,625
Does it matter? Does it matter?

776
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:51,000
- Imagine.
- Hmm?

777
00:43:51,083 --> 00:43:53,792
- Do you call that an achievement? Huh?
- Imagine.

778
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:57,167
Somebody brought you.
Somebody brought you.

779
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:59,625
People will continue
to bring other people.

780
00:43:59,708 --> 00:44:02,750
So don't make a mountain
out of a molehill.

781
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:05,875
He who lives by the sword
will die by the sword.

782
00:44:07,583 --> 00:44:10,083
- I will embarrass you.
- You will see.

783
00:44:10,167 --> 00:44:12,792
- I'll discredit you beyond imagination.
- This won't end here.

784
00:44:12,875 --> 00:44:14,792
Chief, please stay out of this for now.

785
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:18,083
- You will see.
- Continue.

786
00:44:18,167 --> 00:44:19,792
What do I stand to gain from killing Mike?

787
00:44:19,875 --> 00:44:20,875
Mm-hmm.

788
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:23,250
Were you aware there were
three of them in the car that day?

789
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:24,500
Yes, I did.

790
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:26,250
How frequently did you speak to Mike?

791
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:27,917
What has that got to do with this?

792
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,167
What I'm asking is,
when last did you speak to Mike?

793
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,875
The day of the incident.

794
00:44:32,958 --> 00:44:36,500
- And what did you speak about?
- He was asking about my welfare.

795
00:44:36,583 --> 00:44:38,833
He was asking me how I was faring.

796
00:44:38,917 --> 00:44:39,958
Were you sick?

797
00:44:40,042 --> 00:44:44,167
Do you need to be sick
before you're asked about your welfare?

798
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:45,417
How you are faring?

799
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:48,458
- Did he say he was going to the tailor's?
- Yes, he did.

800
00:44:48,542 --> 00:44:51,292
And you knew he was in the car
with his fiancée and her friend?

801
00:44:51,375 --> 00:44:55,917
You obviously have
prior information about this situation.

802
00:44:57,250 --> 00:45:00,083
Could that be what you heard
from my secretary?

803
00:45:00,167 --> 00:45:01,708
Shouldn't we take it seriously?

804
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,583
You called for them
to kill the three of them.

805
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:06,208
- Nonsense.
- Mm!

806
00:45:06,292 --> 00:45:08,333
Arrant nonsense.

807
00:45:08,417 --> 00:45:10,458
How could someone who is reasonable,

808
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:13,750
somebody who is sensible,
could have believed that?

809
00:45:13,833 --> 00:45:15,375
Well, I was hoping you'd tell us.

810
00:45:15,458 --> 00:45:20,167
What happened was there was this sacrifice
I needed to do.

811
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:24,708
I instructed my son
to kill all the three rams.

812
00:45:24,792 --> 00:45:26,125
That was what happened.

813
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:29,333
He who lives by the sword
will die by the sword.

814
00:45:30,208 --> 00:45:32,292
No longer human beings, but rams now.

815
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:35,333
He who lives by the sword
will die by the sword.

816
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:37,208
Yes!

817
00:45:37,958 --> 00:45:40,083
I get it. You want the devil?
I'll show you the devil.

818
00:45:40,167 --> 00:45:43,792
- You'll see. This case is going further.
- You'll see my wrath.

819
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:47,042
Sir, this ram isn't big.
It's not as big as the other one.

820
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:49,042
- This one's bigger.
- This one is bigger?

821
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:51,875
Also, this one is older.

822
00:45:51,958 --> 00:45:54,417
- Can't you see this one?
- What did the boss say?

823
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,167
He instructed us to kill the three rams.

824
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,292
- How can we kill all three?
- Confirm it.

825
00:46:02,167 --> 00:46:03,500
Hello, sir.

826
00:46:04,125 --> 00:46:05,875
Sir, did you say we should kill all three?

827
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:10,250
All right. Okay. Sorry, sir.

828
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:12,292
All right, sir. All right, sir.

829
00:46:12,375 --> 00:46:14,833
Mallam, come quick!

830
00:46:14,917 --> 00:46:17,500
And that was exactly what happened.

831
00:46:17,583 --> 00:46:19,958
Okay. I suggest you don't leave town,

832
00:46:20,042 --> 00:46:21,833
because we'll need you
for further questioning.

833
00:46:21,917 --> 00:46:25,708
- Mmm.
- No problem. I am not going anywhere.

834
00:46:25,792 --> 00:46:28,042
- He should not go.
- Constable.

835
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:31,833
I don't have a hand in Mike's death.
I know nothing about it.

836
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:37,417
Really? Adunni, really?

837
00:46:38,417 --> 00:46:40,083
After everything?

838
00:46:41,583 --> 00:46:43,833
I left my family, I left my fiancé,

839
00:46:43,917 --> 00:46:46,917
everything back in Ghana,
just to come here to be with you.

840
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
And you would think that I would do
something as cruel as killing?

841
00:46:53,167 --> 00:46:54,917
Okay, Miss Nana.

842
00:46:56,542 --> 00:47:00,667
Can you please explain
the conversation you had over the phone?

843
00:47:01,542 --> 00:47:02,542
I was--

844
00:47:05,875 --> 00:47:10,625
I was only rebuking my sister, Efia.
I was on the phone talking to Efia.

845
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:14,917
I suspected my fiancé of cheating on me,

846
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,625
so I told my sister to find out if my--

847
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,375
I told her to find out
if my thoughts were actually real.

848
00:47:23,958 --> 00:47:27,542
I told her to take a picture of the girl
should she ever see anybody,

849
00:47:27,625 --> 00:47:30,375
but Efia ended up beating the girl
alongside her friends.

850
00:47:30,875 --> 00:47:33,375
- And the girl is in coma today. All the--
- Coma?

851
00:47:34,667 --> 00:47:36,333
All the blogs have carried it.

852
00:47:36,417 --> 00:47:38,792
That's what I was talking to her about
over the phone.

853
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:43,042
Can you give us your sister's number

854
00:47:43,125 --> 00:47:45,833
- to verify this information?
- Yes I can!

855
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:53,000
Okay. We will keep investigating.

856
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:55,708
But, in the meantime, Miss Nana,
you can't leave the country.

857
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:58,833
And... we will be in touch.

858
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:01,083
I know you know about this.

859
00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:06,083
You've been watching us all about.
You've been monitoring all our movement.

860
00:48:06,167 --> 00:48:09,833
You know if I'm with Mike
you can never kill him. Never!

861
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:16,000
That was why you sent those foolish people
to break a plank on my head,

862
00:48:16,083 --> 00:48:20,250
so that I'd be in the hospital
so you could do the nonsense you did.

863
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:22,667
- You killed Mike!
- I don't know what you're talking about.

864
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:24,458
- You don't know?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

865
00:48:24,542 --> 00:48:28,125
You'll see my wrath!
You killed my helper.

866
00:48:28,208 --> 00:48:31,625
You killed my benefactor.
And you want to live in this world.

867
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:33,542
Never! It's not possible.

868
00:48:33,625 --> 00:48:37,125
Let me tell you something!
I will not report you to the police.

869
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:40,708
I will not tell them to take you to court
because that will be a waste of time.

870
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:44,917
Ah! In Yoruba land, I'll let you know
that we have spiritual power.

871
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
- I don't know--
- I'll invoke Mike's spirit.

872
00:48:47,083 --> 00:48:48,708
- What is that?
- Ask me again.

873
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:51,000
I will invoke the spirit of the dead.

874
00:48:51,083 --> 00:48:54,917
I will invoke the spirit of Mike
to come after you.

875
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,708
He will not only kill you
but all your family.

876
00:48:57,792 --> 00:49:00,583
- Trust me, I'll let you know who I am.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

877
00:49:00,667 --> 00:49:02,375
You want to turn me into a useless person.

878
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:05,375
If you don't die in the next two days,
call me a bastard.

879
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:07,458
I seriously don't know
what you're talking about.

880
00:49:07,542 --> 00:49:08,667
Oh, my--

881
00:49:10,208 --> 00:49:11,625
Oh, jeez!

882
00:49:14,167 --> 00:49:16,583
I've always warned you
to stop threatening people.

883
00:49:16,667 --> 00:49:21,125
- Now you're a suspect.
- I didn't do it. Come on! I did not!

884
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:29,875
Hey, Uncle, please. Good afternoon.

885
00:49:29,958 --> 00:49:32,167
Please, I'm going to Sabitex Hotel.

886
00:49:34,042 --> 00:49:36,292
- I don't know where--
- They said it's a green building,

887
00:49:36,375 --> 00:49:38,292
- and the landmark is--
- Can you see me?

888
00:49:38,917 --> 00:49:41,125
Can I see you? Uh-uh.

889
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:44,292
I cannot see you. You know that I'm blind.
Or let's just say you're a ghost.

890
00:49:48,917 --> 00:49:50,750
- You can see me!
- Yeah.

891
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:59,417
You can see me! You can see me! Hi.

892
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:02,500
My name is Mike. I'm a ghost.

893
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:09,458
My name is Isla. I'm a tout.

894
00:50:10,042 --> 00:50:12,458
Hold on, okay. What am I doing now?

895
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,375
You're raising your leg up.

896
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:18,875
Wait. Isla. Isla.

897
00:50:18,958 --> 00:50:22,667
I just told you my name once
and you've turned it into Isla.

898
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:26,125
I need your help. I need your help.

899
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:29,292
Some-- Some people just killed me.

900
00:50:29,375 --> 00:50:30,375
Some people just killed me.

901
00:50:30,458 --> 00:50:33,167
- Isla, I need your help.
- Sir, go and sit down, please.

902
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:35,958
Sir, we have seen it all in Nigeria.

903
00:50:38,625 --> 00:50:42,292
Let me tell you something.
I'm a Naija girl to the core!

904
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:44,292
I grew up in the ghetto.
That's where I live.

905
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,125
- We've seen it all!
- No, no, no.

906
00:50:47,208 --> 00:50:48,417
Don't touch me!

907
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,917
You want to touch me
and make me lose my body parts.

908
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,958
I have seen where someone gets into water,
the person is drowning.

909
00:50:57,583 --> 00:51:00,667
The person that was there said,
"Why can't you help?"

910
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:02,833
The person said,
"He doesn't want to come down.

911
00:51:02,917 --> 00:51:04,583
He doesn't want to get in the water

912
00:51:04,667 --> 00:51:07,208
because he doesn't want
to spoil his phone."

913
00:51:07,292 --> 00:51:10,792
So don't think I can be fooled.
I'm a Nigerian.

914
00:51:11,375 --> 00:51:13,958
- Isla, please.
- Please stay away from me!

915
00:51:14,042 --> 00:51:17,333
- I am not as naive as you think.
- Isla.

916
00:51:17,417 --> 00:51:19,667
You're a ghost.
You're a ghost and you're fully dressed.

917
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,417
Isla, some people just killed me.

918
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,958
- Am I the one that killed you?
- I need your help.

919
00:51:24,042 --> 00:51:27,333
- Am I the one that killed you?
- Isla, don't leave me. Please.

920
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,583
I swear to almighty Allah,

921
00:51:30,667 --> 00:51:33,917
if you stress me again, I'll push you

922
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,375
and you'll be crushed by a car
and you'll die.

923
00:51:38,458 --> 00:51:41,917
Please, I need your help.

924
00:51:43,542 --> 00:51:46,917
You can only swindle the rich girls,
not me.

925
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,250
I know it's hard to believe,
but I need your help.

926
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:51,000
I'll scream if you don't leave me alone.

927
00:51:51,083 --> 00:51:53,208
You're the only one that can see me.
The only one.

928
00:51:53,292 --> 00:51:55,125
You know what?
I accept that you're a ghost.

929
00:51:55,208 --> 00:51:56,750
- Okay.
- I'm a ghost, too.

930
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:58,375
- You're a ghost?
- Yes.

931
00:51:58,458 --> 00:52:00,625
- You see that ghost and ghost don't work.
- No!

932
00:52:00,708 --> 00:52:02,833
Go away with your ghost stories!

933
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:05,792
Is something wrong with you?
Go away with your ghost stories!

934
00:52:05,875 --> 00:52:07,542
I've heard you. You're a ghost.
I'm a ghost.

935
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,375
We're both ghosts.

936
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:11,667
Ghosts don't play. Go!

937
00:52:13,167 --> 00:52:15,625
- Should I explain to you?
- Go ahead.

938
00:52:15,708 --> 00:52:17,917
There are some things going on
in our cabal.

939
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,917
As we're sitting here,
there are spirit beings in people.

940
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,208
Everyone you see has a spirit being
living inside them.

941
00:52:23,292 --> 00:52:25,250
This guy you're looking at is a spirit.

942
00:52:25,792 --> 00:52:27,083
Man.

943
00:52:27,167 --> 00:52:30,417
If I talk more about this,
I'll get emotional.

944
00:52:31,042 --> 00:52:32,833
This guy you're looking at right now.

945
00:52:33,542 --> 00:52:36,167
You know C. Ronaldo?

946
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:38,042
- Hold on.
- Say no more, sir.

947
00:52:38,125 --> 00:52:40,542
Wait, you mean the Ronaldo
that plays for Madrid?

948
00:52:40,625 --> 00:52:43,958
- The one that plays for Madrid.
- He and this guy are kindred spirits.

949
00:52:44,042 --> 00:52:46,042
- Unbelievable.
- They are kindred spirits.

950
00:52:46,708 --> 00:52:48,417
They're kindred spirits.

951
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,208
You know this guy. You know Messi?

952
00:52:51,292 --> 00:52:52,667
Messi that plays for Barça?

953
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:56,042
- Bro.
- He and this guy are kindred spirits.

954
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:58,583
They are kindred spirits. I know.

955
00:52:58,667 --> 00:53:00,750
- They're kindred spirits.
- Bro!

956
00:53:01,708 --> 00:53:03,500
- Forget about that.
- We need to say it.

957
00:53:03,583 --> 00:53:06,208
- He deserves respect. He's my friend.
- Okay, I hear you.

958
00:53:06,292 --> 00:53:08,000
- Now today is today.
- Okay.

959
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:10,083
- What's happening today?
- I want to tell you something.

960
00:53:10,792 --> 00:53:15,083
I want to do the party today
because the money has been paid.

961
00:53:15,167 --> 00:53:17,875
- Baby, tell them.
- What kind of party is that?

962
00:53:19,833 --> 00:53:21,542
- Tell them!
- You want me to say it?

963
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:23,875
- What is it?
- I hope they won't start extorting you.

964
00:53:24,417 --> 00:53:28,875
Okay, this guy you're all looking at
says he wants to throw a party.

965
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:30,750
- Do you know where he built his house?
- Where?

966
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:32,667
Banana Island.

967
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:33,792
I'm shocked.

968
00:53:33,875 --> 00:53:35,583
Unbelievable!

969
00:53:35,667 --> 00:53:37,958
Let me tell you all something else.

970
00:53:38,542 --> 00:53:39,792
As this guy is here now...

971
00:53:39,875 --> 00:53:43,833
You know the popular gossip blogger,
Linda Ikeji?

972
00:53:43,917 --> 00:53:44,917
They're neighbors.

973
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:51,917
Impossible.

974
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,542
I can't be telling lies at my age.

975
00:53:54,625 --> 00:53:56,708
- Let me now tell you the last thing.
- Tell us.

976
00:53:56,792 --> 00:53:59,750
- You heard he wants to throw a party?
- Yes?

977
00:53:59,833 --> 00:54:03,042
It's not because he's a party freak.
He likes music.

978
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:08,583
He has a mini studio set up in his house

979
00:54:08,667 --> 00:54:11,292
with all the gadgets in it.

980
00:54:11,375 --> 00:54:13,750
He likes music. So the--

981
00:54:14,667 --> 00:54:18,042
Please, leave me.
Let me blow your trumpet.

982
00:54:18,833 --> 00:54:24,208
Linda went to report
to the Banana Island residents association

983
00:54:24,292 --> 00:54:27,042
that his music disturbs her
and he should be evicted.

984
00:54:27,125 --> 00:54:30,458
People are envious.

985
00:54:30,542 --> 00:54:31,917
I'll tell you another thing.

986
00:54:32,542 --> 00:54:34,708
Do you know who this man is?

987
00:54:34,792 --> 00:54:36,958
This man knows Mike Adenuga,
the billionaire.

988
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:43,625
Let me say the last one.
If I speak again after this...

989
00:54:43,708 --> 00:54:46,708
Damn. This lady has killed me.

990
00:54:46,792 --> 00:54:50,708
- If I talk again, let me die.
- Isla.

991
00:54:50,792 --> 00:54:53,417
Let me just say this last one.
They need to know.

992
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:57,292
You know the name of Mike's company
is Glo, right?

993
00:54:57,375 --> 00:55:00,333
He named the company after his mother.
Her name was Gloria.

994
00:55:00,417 --> 00:55:03,083
He just removed the "ria"
and named the company Glo.

995
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:05,083
<i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

996
00:55:05,167 --> 00:55:07,000
Kill me instead.

997
00:55:07,083 --> 00:55:09,125
Don't kill me. I don't have money today.

998
00:55:10,333 --> 00:55:13,167
- Why would I lie?
- I need your help, please.

999
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:15,000
- What are you doing?
- I need your help.

1000
00:55:15,083 --> 00:55:16,667
- Come on.
- What was that?

1001
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,208
Who is Isla talking to?

1002
00:55:18,292 --> 00:55:20,750
- Hold on.
- Baby.

1003
00:55:20,833 --> 00:55:22,875
- Can't you guys see him?
- Who?

1004
00:55:22,958 --> 00:55:26,792
He has black shoes
and brown trousers with a--

1005
00:55:27,375 --> 00:55:32,833
It looks like she's drunk already.

1006
00:55:32,917 --> 00:55:34,208
- Give me one minute.
- Okay.

1007
00:55:34,292 --> 00:55:35,917
Don't you see him?

1008
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:38,917
So you're actually a ghost?

1009
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:40,917
- Nobody is here.
- Okay.

1010
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,667
You know what? It looks like
Isla drank contaminated water.

1011
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:47,292
- Isla has lost her mind!
- Hey, Isla!

1012
00:55:47,375 --> 00:55:49,625
I know what the problem is.

1013
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:01,750
Dayo!

1014
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:06,125
Stop knocking. Let's wait for him.

1015
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:13,792
What nonsense is this?

1016
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:14,875
Wait, wait.

1017
00:56:18,167 --> 00:56:19,167
What's up?

1018
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:21,292
I'm here to see Dayo. Is he home?

1019
00:56:22,833 --> 00:56:24,208
- What did you say?
- Who?

1020
00:56:24,292 --> 00:56:27,125
- Dayo.
- Wait, what did you say Dayo did?

1021
00:56:27,208 --> 00:56:29,000
So it is Dayo you came looking for?

1022
00:56:29,083 --> 00:56:31,292
You're one of those girls
that follow him around!

1023
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,792
Isla, Isla.

1024
00:57:02,292 --> 00:57:03,500
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

1025
00:57:03,583 --> 00:57:05,208
I'm coming from the bank. I'm okay.

1026
00:57:05,292 --> 00:57:07,500
- I'm sorry.
- Leave me alone! What is it?

1027
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:09,625
- I'm sorry.
- Please, am I the one that killed you?

1028
00:57:09,708 --> 00:57:12,375
"Say no to drugs." You don't listen.

1029
00:57:12,458 --> 00:57:15,708
I'll stab you or push you
in front of a moving car and you will die.

1030
00:57:15,792 --> 00:57:17,375
- Isla, I'm sorry.
- Oh, he's already dead.

1031
00:57:17,458 --> 00:57:19,917
- Help me, please.
- Help you for what? For what?

1032
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,333
- Isla, I'm sorry.
- Do you know what I went through there?

1033
00:57:22,417 --> 00:57:24,500
Okay, let's go to my fiancée's place.

1034
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:29,750
- Please. Isla, please.
- If these people come--

1035
00:57:30,417 --> 00:57:32,208
I said I'm not doing it. Can I go?

1036
00:57:33,125 --> 00:57:34,583
- What's this now?
- Isla, help me.

1037
00:57:34,667 --> 00:57:36,583
- Help you for what?
- Help me, please.

1038
00:57:36,667 --> 00:57:38,875
- I've not heard this before.
- Help me, please.

1039
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:42,250
- It's like you want to see madness today.
- Isla, please.

1040
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:44,792
I swear, if you follow me,
I'm going to strip naked.

1041
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:46,500
Isla, please.

1042
00:57:46,583 --> 00:57:49,250
Ah! Stop following me.
Do I know this person?

1043
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:51,542
Leave me alone.
I said I'm not going again.

1044
00:57:51,625 --> 00:57:55,458
You sent me somewhere. I got a beating.
For what? No!

1045
00:57:55,542 --> 00:57:57,833
Am I the one that killed you?
No, let's talk!

1046
00:57:57,917 --> 00:58:00,333
Am I the one that killed you?
Am I responsible for your death?

1047
00:58:01,208 --> 00:58:04,042
What are you begging me for?
Somebody help me, please.

1048
00:58:05,042 --> 00:58:11,292
What is it? Did I know you before?
What is it?

1049
00:58:11,375 --> 00:58:13,875
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

1050
00:58:13,958 --> 00:58:17,208
I'm not doing it again.
I'm not doing it again.

1051
00:58:17,292 --> 00:58:20,833
I'm coming. Please, please. What is it?
Please, I--

1052
00:58:20,917 --> 00:58:24,833
Don't beg me. Don't beg me.
I am not interested.

1053
00:58:24,917 --> 00:58:27,750
I'm not going. I went somewhere.
Look at the way they beat me.

1054
00:58:27,833 --> 00:58:29,875
Am I an armed robber? Did I steal?

1055
00:58:29,958 --> 00:58:31,500
Did I sleep with someone's husband?

1056
00:58:31,583 --> 00:58:33,542
What is it? Nothing!

1057
00:58:33,625 --> 00:58:35,208
- Sorry.
- I'm done helping you.

1058
00:58:35,875 --> 00:58:38,958
- Listen to me now. How's it going?
- Fine. Good afternoon.

1059
00:58:39,042 --> 00:58:40,542
- I hope you're okay?
- I'm okay.

1060
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:41,875
I believe there's no problem.

1061
00:58:41,958 --> 00:58:44,375
There's no problem.
This man is just disturbing me.

1062
00:58:44,458 --> 00:58:46,875
- Who?
- He sent me somewhere.

1063
00:58:46,958 --> 00:58:48,833
I went there. Look at what they did to me.

1064
00:58:48,917 --> 00:58:50,250
I'm just fed up.

1065
00:58:50,333 --> 00:58:52,333
- Leave me alone!
- Sorry.

1066
00:58:52,417 --> 00:58:55,708
Stop begging me! Stop begging me!

1067
00:58:55,792 --> 00:58:57,750
She said you should not beg her anymore.

1068
00:58:57,833 --> 00:59:00,375
- Do you know what you're going to do now?
- Don't follow me.

1069
00:59:01,125 --> 00:59:03,792
You know what's going to happen?
Do you know Yaba Hospital?

1070
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:06,500
- Yaba.
- Yaba?

1071
00:59:06,583 --> 00:59:08,500
- To Yaba.
- Yes?

1072
00:59:08,583 --> 00:59:10,083
Let's go there together.

1073
00:59:10,167 --> 00:59:12,667
Oh! At the left side of Yaba bus stop?

1074
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:14,917
- Yes. It's not far.
- Have you seen what you've done?

1075
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,208
Now they think I'm mad.
They want to take me to Yaba.

1076
00:59:17,292 --> 00:59:20,375
- Don't worry.
- Listen, I am not mad.

1077
00:59:20,458 --> 00:59:23,792
- I am just trying to help somebody.
- Okay.

1078
00:59:23,875 --> 00:59:25,583
If you beg me, thunder will kill you.

1079
00:59:26,458 --> 00:59:28,583
I'm trying to help somebody.
Please, let me just go.

1080
00:59:28,667 --> 00:59:29,875
I understand you.

1081
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:32,167
I understand you. Yeah.

1082
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:34,792
- We won't be long.
- Let us go to Yaba.

1083
00:59:34,875 --> 00:59:37,625
- I'm not mad.
- I know.

1084
00:59:37,708 --> 00:59:39,292
I know, you're not mad at all.

1085
00:59:40,375 --> 00:59:43,292
Let me explain something to you. You--

1086
00:59:45,292 --> 00:59:47,917
- Wait. You see, let me explain.
- Let her be.

1087
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,667
Wait.

1088
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:51,125
You see what-- Look at something.

1089
00:59:53,792 --> 00:59:55,333
I'm not mad!

1090
01:00:02,375 --> 01:00:04,500
- Okay, 1,000.
- 1,000.

1091
01:00:04,583 --> 01:00:06,042
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

1092
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:08,708
- Greetings.
- Greetings to you, too.

1093
01:00:09,458 --> 01:00:11,542
- Fine girl.
- I've come to pay my carnival fee.

1094
01:00:11,625 --> 01:00:13,417
- Have you paid the sector fee?
- Yes, I have.

1095
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,417
- Are you sure?
- I've paid, Auntie.

1096
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,542
- I will ask!
- What sector do you belong to?

1097
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:19,750
- Number 33.
- Oh.

1098
01:00:19,833 --> 01:00:21,208
- Sector 33?
- Garage side.

1099
01:00:21,292 --> 01:00:22,333
Yetunde.

1100
01:00:26,125 --> 01:00:28,375
- Please take care of me now, ladies.
- Shut up!

1101
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:31,417
Don't make me break your head.
Who do you think you're talking to?

1102
01:00:32,042 --> 01:00:34,417
- Lady, respect yourself, please.
- Where is your sector?

1103
01:00:34,958 --> 01:00:38,292
My sector is on that side.

1104
01:00:39,042 --> 01:00:40,625
- What's your name?
- Uh...

1105
01:00:40,708 --> 01:00:42,917
- What's your name?
- Eliazu Texas.

1106
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,958
- What did he say?
- Eliazu Texas. Just write "Monkey."

1107
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:47,958
Have you seen what you've done?

1108
01:00:48,042 --> 01:00:49,875
- No...
- You've gotten yourself in a mess. Monkey!

1109
01:00:49,958 --> 01:00:52,625
- Monkey, M-O-K--
- Stupid monkey!

1110
01:00:52,708 --> 01:00:55,625
- No, make it "Stupid."
- Get away from here!

1111
01:00:55,708 --> 01:00:57,208
Only you two know what you're doing.

1112
01:00:57,292 --> 01:00:59,208
- Respect yourselves.
- I hope you get chicken pox.

1113
01:00:59,292 --> 01:01:02,125
Hey! Sit down.

1114
01:01:03,917 --> 01:01:06,000
- Carnival money.
- Carnival money.

1115
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:10,875
How much did we agree on?

1116
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:11,958
2,000.

1117
01:01:12,042 --> 01:01:13,375
- 2,000?
- Yes.

1118
01:01:13,458 --> 01:01:15,125
- 2,000?
- Yes.

1119
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:17,250
- 2,000.
- Yes.

1120
01:01:17,333 --> 01:01:19,500
Please can I pay 12 times?

1121
01:01:21,083 --> 01:01:22,625
As in 80 naira each time?

1122
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:25,417
But wait, the two--

1123
01:01:26,167 --> 01:01:28,875
The 200 naira you collect from us,
what do you use it for?

1124
01:01:28,958 --> 01:01:30,208
- It's sector money.
- What?

1125
01:01:30,292 --> 01:01:31,333
Do you collect shit?

1126
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:40,292
I said... the 200 naira
that you people collect from us--

1127
01:01:40,375 --> 01:01:42,500
- Why are you running?
- Come closer and say it.

1128
01:01:42,583 --> 01:01:46,500
You're stupid. Fools.
You're trying to extort me.

1129
01:01:46,583 --> 01:01:47,958
Come and sit down.

1130
01:01:48,042 --> 01:01:50,375
It's because I don't want
to stain the chair with blood.

1131
01:01:50,458 --> 01:01:51,625
God punish you.

1132
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,333
- Hey. Isla?
- Did she just ask me that?

1133
01:01:54,417 --> 01:01:56,042
- You asked a question?
- You're talking to us?

1134
01:01:56,125 --> 01:01:58,292
If you come-- Me, I'm not your husband.

1135
01:01:58,375 --> 01:02:01,583
I'll teach you a lesson if you get close.
I dare you to come.

1136
01:02:01,667 --> 01:02:03,167
Osondu, have a seat. Forget about it!

1137
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:05,125
There's something wrong with her.
I'll find out.

1138
01:02:05,208 --> 01:02:07,792
Something's wrong with you, too!
Something's wrong with you!

1139
01:02:07,875 --> 01:02:10,625
There's something wrong with you!
There's something wrong with you!

1140
01:02:10,708 --> 01:02:13,500
There is-- Both of you are mad.
You think I'm stupid, right?

1141
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:17,458
You want to use me to do training.
God will punish you!

1142
01:02:17,542 --> 01:02:20,917
- Look at you.
- Osondu, sit down. This is temptation.

1143
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:24,875
I'm sorry, Isla, please.
We need to go now, please.

1144
01:02:24,958 --> 01:02:27,000
I cannot go to any man's house again.

1145
01:02:27,083 --> 01:02:29,458
You need to go and see my fiancée, Isla.

1146
01:02:29,542 --> 01:02:30,583
- Your fiancée?
- Yes.

1147
01:02:30,667 --> 01:02:34,833
You want to spoil everything.
I can't go see any man, over my dead body.

1148
01:02:36,333 --> 01:02:38,042
What's making you laugh?

1149
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:41,208
My fiancée is a woman. Fiancée is a woman.

1150
01:02:41,292 --> 01:02:42,417
- So, it's a woman?
- Yes.

1151
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:43,792
No problem.

1152
01:02:44,375 --> 01:02:46,458
Your constant begging
is making me sympathetic.

1153
01:02:46,542 --> 01:02:48,042
Put yourself in my shoes.

1154
01:02:48,125 --> 01:02:50,292
- Isla!
- Stop it!

1155
01:02:50,375 --> 01:02:53,125
If you don't know how to hail me, stop it.
What's wrong with this rich boy?

1156
01:02:53,208 --> 01:02:55,958
But the thing is,
you'll pay me for these jobs.

1157
01:02:56,042 --> 01:02:58,708
I'll pay you, Isla.
I'll tell my fiancée to pay you.

1158
01:02:58,792 --> 01:02:59,792
That's better.

1159
01:02:59,875 --> 01:03:06,125
I have a reputation for being a tough girl
in this neighborhood,

1160
01:03:06,208 --> 01:03:07,875
and I was beaten up like a thief.

1161
01:03:07,958 --> 01:03:09,625
Thank you. Thank you.

1162
01:03:10,542 --> 01:03:11,542
Isla!

1163
01:03:11,625 --> 01:03:13,458
Don't do that
in the presence of everybody.

1164
01:03:13,542 --> 01:03:15,583
- You make me look like a crazy person.
- I'm sorry.

1165
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:17,750
You talk to me,
knowing fully well nobody sees you.

1166
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:20,208
- I'm sorry.
- Everybody will think I'm crazy.

1167
01:03:20,292 --> 01:03:21,833
Thank you. Isla!

1168
01:03:21,917 --> 01:03:23,500
Stop it. It doesn't fit you.

1169
01:03:23,583 --> 01:03:24,792
"Isla."

1170
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:26,667
- You look like a cartoon.
- Thank you.

1171
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:29,833
Don't follow me.
I want to go and take transport fare. Ah!

1172
01:03:29,917 --> 01:03:33,083
But wait, I'm sure you must have been
very stubborn when you were alive.

1173
01:03:33,167 --> 01:03:36,667
What's the matter?
No wonder heaven rejected you.

1174
01:03:37,625 --> 01:03:40,083
- My name is Adunni. What's yours?
- Isla.

1175
01:03:40,667 --> 01:03:44,000
Oh, Isla. Um... would you like to sit?

1176
01:03:44,083 --> 01:03:45,958
No, I'm fine. I'm very fine.

1177
01:03:46,042 --> 01:03:50,375
But I swear, your house is fine.

1178
01:03:50,458 --> 01:03:53,875
- So fine!
- Thank you. Thank you.

1179
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:58,708
- Everything looks really good.
- Thank you very much.

1180
01:03:58,792 --> 01:04:02,667
- So you wanted to see me about my fiancé?
- Yes, yes.

1181
01:04:02,750 --> 01:04:06,792
- Sorry, I haven't seen your face before.
- No, I've not seen your face.

1182
01:04:06,875 --> 01:04:10,375
You have seen so many faces.
But your own face, zero.

1183
01:04:10,458 --> 01:04:12,583
- Nice one.
- You're welcome.

1184
01:04:12,667 --> 01:04:16,667
So, my late fiancé, what's this about?

1185
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:17,792
Please, excuse me.

1186
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:21,542
- Is she the one? Get out.
- I'm sorry.

1187
01:04:21,625 --> 01:04:23,792
Sorry, is she the person?

1188
01:04:23,875 --> 01:04:26,375
- You have taste.
- I'm sorry.

1189
01:04:26,458 --> 01:04:28,792
Um... hello?

1190
01:04:28,875 --> 01:04:29,958
Hi.

1191
01:04:30,042 --> 01:04:31,375
Who are you talking to?

1192
01:04:32,917 --> 01:04:34,208
I'm soliloquizing.

1193
01:04:35,375 --> 01:04:36,875
Uh, okay, um...

1194
01:04:36,958 --> 01:04:41,167
So, I haven't seen you before.
What would you like to talk to me about?

1195
01:04:42,167 --> 01:04:43,833
Should I tell her everything?

1196
01:04:43,917 --> 01:04:46,875
Um... your fiancé sent me to you.

1197
01:04:46,958 --> 01:04:50,292
Sorry to interrupt.
You do know that my fiancé is dead?

1198
01:04:51,833 --> 01:04:53,167
Of course I know.

1199
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:55,958
But please hold on. Let me ask him
if I should tell you everything.

1200
01:04:56,667 --> 01:05:01,250
Your fiancé said I should tell you
what actually happened.

1201
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:05,583
I'm sorry, I have to interrupt.
I don't understand what's going on.

1202
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:08,708
Who are you talking to?

1203
01:05:08,792 --> 01:05:12,125
What I'm trying to say
is that he's the one that sent me to you.

1204
01:05:12,833 --> 01:05:16,042
Yeah, I heard that.
Who are you talking to right now?

1205
01:05:16,125 --> 01:05:17,667
As I said before...

1206
01:05:19,125 --> 01:05:20,667
I'm soliloquizing.

1207
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,417
Okay, um...

1208
01:05:23,708 --> 01:05:25,000
- That's okay.
- Okay.

1209
01:05:25,083 --> 01:05:29,250
- He said I should tell you there is...
- Okay.

1210
01:05:30,417 --> 01:05:32,792
- Someone--
- Yeah, just a second, please.

1211
01:05:35,125 --> 01:05:36,458
Security, please.

1212
01:05:36,542 --> 01:05:38,458
Security.

1213
01:05:38,542 --> 01:05:40,708
Would you please
make it up to my apartment right now?

1214
01:05:40,792 --> 01:05:43,208
Thank you. You are cute.

1215
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:51,833
Sorry to cut your-your...
your little chat there.

1216
01:05:56,042 --> 01:05:58,750
- Dehinde?
- Your name is Dehinde?

1217
01:05:58,833 --> 01:06:00,875
You're Yoruba? I'm Isla.

1218
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:04,375
Why did you let an insane woman
into my house?

1219
01:06:04,458 --> 01:06:05,792
Tell me why. It's wrong.

1220
01:06:05,875 --> 01:06:08,750
I asked you a question. Why would you
let a madwoman into my house?

1221
01:06:08,833 --> 01:06:10,625
Tell me, are you a mad person?

1222
01:06:10,708 --> 01:06:13,583
Ah! I'm a mad person? Come on.

1223
01:06:13,667 --> 01:06:15,125
You called me a madwoman?

1224
01:06:15,208 --> 01:06:19,333
- You see what you have caused?
- You see what I'm saying?

1225
01:06:19,417 --> 01:06:20,708
Let me pass.

1226
01:06:22,625 --> 01:06:25,250
You see what you have caused?
No problem.

1227
01:06:26,375 --> 01:06:28,458
Just imagine!

1228
01:06:28,542 --> 01:06:30,500
Today is my off day. I swear.

1229
01:06:30,583 --> 01:06:32,833
If today wasn't my off day,
I'd stab you in many places.

1230
01:06:32,917 --> 01:06:35,417
I would do liposuction for you.
There's no point.

1231
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:39,500
- Sorry, ma.
- Touch me and you will regret it.

1232
01:06:39,583 --> 01:06:43,167
See, man. I cannot go anywhere again.

1233
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:44,958
What is it?

1234
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:47,958
The first time you sent me, they beat me.
For what?

1235
01:06:48,042 --> 01:06:51,042
The second time,
your girl is calling me crazy.

1236
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:53,792
And the gateman called me crazy.

1237
01:06:53,875 --> 01:06:54,917
God forbid.

1238
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,875
And she's lucky today is my off day.
I'd have beaten her to a pulp.

1239
01:06:58,958 --> 01:07:01,000
Please, I don't know about your death.

1240
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:03,292
I've never met you.
I don't have any problem with you.

1241
01:07:03,375 --> 01:07:06,250
I'm on my own. Please just go.

1242
01:07:06,333 --> 01:07:08,833
Where else do you want me to go?

1243
01:07:08,917 --> 01:07:11,458
Go to the graveyard!

1244
01:07:11,542 --> 01:07:14,667
You have a resting place. Go there.
You can't be stressing me.

1245
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:16,208
Please, you have to help me.

1246
01:07:17,167 --> 01:07:20,208
You have to help me. I'm helpless.

1247
01:07:20,292 --> 01:07:23,583
You're the only one that can see me.
I can't go anywhere.

1248
01:07:24,625 --> 01:07:26,250
Isla, please.

1249
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:28,375
I can't help you, sir.

1250
01:07:28,458 --> 01:07:32,000
Hey! Lord, what an unfortunate day it was
that I ran into masquerades.

1251
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:34,042
I've been seeing spirits since that day.

1252
01:07:34,125 --> 01:07:36,417
I know you have a good heart.

1253
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:41,000
I have seen the way you behave
among everyone.

1254
01:07:41,083 --> 01:07:42,583
You have to help people.

1255
01:07:42,667 --> 01:07:45,292
I know you have good intentions for me.

1256
01:07:47,125 --> 01:07:50,042
Isla, if there's anything you can do--

1257
01:07:50,125 --> 01:07:52,833
I'm begging you.

1258
01:07:52,917 --> 01:07:54,792
I'm begging you. Please.

1259
01:07:54,875 --> 01:07:58,208
It's okay. You know how to get me.

1260
01:07:58,292 --> 01:08:01,750
When people say I have a good heart,
it makes me melt.

1261
01:08:01,833 --> 01:08:04,000
You know just how to make me melt.

1262
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:07,292
You just keep saying
all the right loving words.

1263
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:09,417
You're making somebody feel important.

1264
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:12,167
I don't understand you.

1265
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:14,958
I cannot be going through
all this trouble. Uh-uh.

1266
01:08:15,042 --> 01:08:19,208
Why don't you tell me the things
that is just between you and her?

1267
01:08:19,292 --> 01:08:22,958
When I get there and tell her,
she'll know that I'm saying the truth.

1268
01:08:23,042 --> 01:08:27,958
I will tell you things
that only I and her know. Please.

1269
01:08:28,667 --> 01:08:30,125
She will believe you this time.

1270
01:08:30,208 --> 01:08:33,042
Wait, wait, wait.
All this job that I'm doing for you,

1271
01:08:33,125 --> 01:08:35,792
how much are you going to pay me?
Because I want to be paid.

1272
01:08:35,875 --> 01:08:37,500
How much do you want?

1273
01:08:37,583 --> 01:08:39,708
I will collect 30,000.

1274
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:43,292
Okay, wait. Give me 25.

1275
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:48,583
You're still frowning.
See, the least I can go is 20.

1276
01:08:48,667 --> 01:08:53,125
If you cannot pay me 20-- pshh.
Go. I'm not interested.

1277
01:08:53,208 --> 01:08:55,417
I can't go less than 20.
It's not possible.

1278
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:59,458
I can't. I can never.
God forbid. Over my dead body. I can't.

1279
01:08:59,542 --> 01:09:01,708
I can't do less than that.
I've lost a lot of jobs--

1280
01:09:01,792 --> 01:09:03,750
What's making you laugh?

1281
01:09:03,833 --> 01:09:06,125
Isla, I was thinking around...

1282
01:09:07,583 --> 01:09:08,708
five million.

1283
01:09:08,792 --> 01:09:11,042
- Five million?
- Five million naira.

1284
01:09:11,125 --> 01:09:14,792
You want me to charge you five million
so you can run away.

1285
01:09:14,875 --> 01:09:17,250
You'll now say
it's because the bill is too much.

1286
01:09:17,333 --> 01:09:21,083
No, I'll tell my fiancée
to give you five million naira.

1287
01:09:21,167 --> 01:09:23,917
- Swear in God's name.
- I swear to God.

1288
01:09:24,375 --> 01:09:26,250
Ah! You said God.

1289
01:09:26,333 --> 01:09:28,583
You know that you must not
call the name of God in vain.

1290
01:09:28,667 --> 01:09:30,917
And you know that liars go to hellfire.

1291
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,917
Maybe you missed heaven
because you are a liar.

1292
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,875
You won't rest in peace
if you keep lying as a ghost.

1293
01:09:37,958 --> 01:09:39,917
Trust me, I'm not lying.

1294
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,792
I'll go anywhere. I will go.

1295
01:09:41,875 --> 01:09:44,167
- Isla, you'll go?
- Anywhere you send me.

1296
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:48,750
I am even willing to go
back to where I was beaten up.

1297
01:09:48,833 --> 01:09:52,708
Five million is worth getting beaten up.

1298
01:09:52,792 --> 01:09:54,875
Let's go.

1299
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:58,542
So, let's see tomorrow. I'll go tomorrow.

1300
01:09:58,625 --> 01:10:00,208
- Okay. Yeah.
- You understand.

1301
01:10:00,292 --> 01:10:03,625
- Thank you so much. You can go now.
- Thank you.

1302
01:10:03,708 --> 01:10:05,375
You can go. I want to undress.

1303
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:08,542
You can go ahead. I'm a ghost.

1304
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:11,958
You're a ghost? So because you're a ghost,
I should let you see me naked?

1305
01:10:12,042 --> 01:10:13,708
Or should I help you?

1306
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:17,667
Should you help me? Oh, now I remember
why you're not allowed in heaven.

1307
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:20,583
No womanizer can ever rest in peace.

1308
01:10:20,667 --> 01:10:23,542
I've heard you. You've been saying
all along you're a ghost.

1309
01:10:23,625 --> 01:10:25,917
Don't worry, sir, just go.

1310
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:29,917
- Isla.
- I'm not joking. Just leave.

1311
01:10:36,625 --> 01:10:39,167
Isla, who are you talking to?

1312
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:42,625
I'm not talking to anybody.

1313
01:10:42,708 --> 01:10:45,750
Isla, I heard a voice just now.

1314
01:10:45,833 --> 01:10:48,625
That's impossible.
I was talking to myself.

1315
01:10:48,708 --> 01:10:53,125
Isla, if I didn't come here now, is this
what you'd be doing behind my back?

1316
01:10:53,208 --> 01:10:57,958
Not at all. I wasn't talking to anybody.
I was talking alone.

1317
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,250
I love you.

1318
01:12:24,417 --> 01:12:27,042
<i>So, it's-- it's real.</i>

1319
01:12:27,125 --> 01:12:29,958
It's real. Why will I be lying?

1320
01:12:30,042 --> 01:12:34,208
Let me tell you my motto.
My motto is "You do not lie.

1321
01:12:34,292 --> 01:12:36,375
If you know you want to lie, don't talk."

1322
01:12:36,458 --> 01:12:38,792
I can feel his presence.

1323
01:12:38,875 --> 01:12:42,875
He's even here.
He's here. He's looking at you.

1324
01:12:45,333 --> 01:12:46,458
What's he doing?

1325
01:12:47,167 --> 01:12:49,625
- What are you--
- What's he doing?

1326
01:12:49,708 --> 01:12:52,625
Tell me, tell me.
What is he-- What is he doing?

1327
01:12:52,708 --> 01:12:53,875
I love you so much.

1328
01:12:53,958 --> 01:12:57,042
He said that he loves you so much.

1329
01:12:57,125 --> 01:12:58,458
You're crying.

1330
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,542
Tell him I love him too and I miss him.

1331
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:04,625
He said he loves you too,
that he misses you.

1332
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:06,708
Did he hear you?

1333
01:13:06,792 --> 01:13:08,250
He can hear you. He's not deaf.

1334
01:13:08,333 --> 01:13:10,875
I wish that I could hold you.

1335
01:13:10,958 --> 01:13:12,833
Aw.

1336
01:13:12,917 --> 01:13:14,583
He said he misses you, too.

1337
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:18,083
He said you're his world.

1338
01:13:18,167 --> 01:13:21,542
Dear Lord, this is genuine love.

1339
01:13:21,625 --> 01:13:24,667
If only Hakeem can show me
this kind of love, but that one,

1340
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:27,625
he's a stupid person.

1341
01:13:27,708 --> 01:13:31,750
- Anyway, I want to be going.
- Oh, no, don't go. Please stay.

1342
01:13:31,833 --> 01:13:33,250
I should stay? Why?

1343
01:13:33,333 --> 01:13:35,125
This is not my house. I have my house.

1344
01:13:35,208 --> 01:13:36,458
You've become family.

1345
01:13:36,542 --> 01:13:41,542
Ah! No, we're not family. I'm so sorry.
We're never family. I'm sorry.

1346
01:13:41,625 --> 01:13:43,000
Please, I have to go.

1347
01:13:43,083 --> 01:13:44,500
Okay, can I have your number?

1348
01:13:44,583 --> 01:13:46,583
You say what?

1349
01:13:46,667 --> 01:13:48,083
Can I have your number, please?

1350
01:13:48,167 --> 01:13:49,875
You say what?

1351
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:53,083
- I don't give my number to strangers.
- Please.

1352
01:13:53,167 --> 01:13:54,750
- You--
- Isla.

1353
01:13:55,667 --> 01:14:01,083
It is because of him.

1354
01:14:01,167 --> 01:14:06,000
I'm doing it because I don't want
to do anything to offend a spirit.

1355
01:14:06,083 --> 01:14:08,958
Now you're asking for my number.

1356
01:14:09,042 --> 01:14:13,167
The other day, you called me a madwoman.

1357
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:15,375
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1358
01:14:15,458 --> 01:14:17,333
This is a family house. It's okay.

1359
01:14:17,417 --> 01:14:18,625
So can I have it now?

1360
01:14:18,708 --> 01:14:21,458
- 0-8-0-5.
- Okay, hold on.

1361
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:23,917
My number. I'm sorry, just let me--

1362
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,500
- I don't steal phones.
- I'm sorry.

1363
01:14:25,583 --> 01:14:27,542
I'm so excited.

1364
01:14:27,625 --> 01:14:29,375
Please don't go.

1365
01:14:29,458 --> 01:14:35,833
Tell him to wait,
and I'll be right back with my phone.

1366
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:38,250
What's wrong with this one?

1367
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:44,833
Listen, she's only excited
because you were rich when you were alive.

1368
01:14:44,917 --> 01:14:49,125
If you were from a poor home,
she would be different.

1369
01:14:49,208 --> 01:14:50,917
I think she loves you.

I don't know
why this guy keeps following me around.

1385
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,917
Saheed Osupa is singing,
and everybody is dancing.

1386
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,917
This is what we've been
contributing money for since January.

1387
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:05,667
I'm coming. Hold on.

1388
01:16:09,083 --> 01:16:11,708
Madam, I'm tired.

1389
01:16:11,792 --> 01:16:14,000
I cannot be stressing myself
because of you people!

1390
01:16:14,083 --> 01:16:18,625
Do you know what it means
to see Saheed Osupa and DJ Kano?

1391
01:16:18,708 --> 01:16:20,417
And your man came to tell me

1392
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:23,625
he saw his killer on stage
and asked me to come and tell you.

1393
01:16:23,708 --> 01:16:26,125
- Calm down, breathe.
- I'm calm.

1394
01:16:26,208 --> 01:16:27,708
I've been paying 200 naira every month

1395
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:31,375
just to pay for my carnival money.

1396
01:16:31,458 --> 01:16:32,958
Okay, I'm trying to figure this out.

1397
01:16:33,042 --> 01:16:35,750
You contribute 200 naira every--
for a carnival?

1398
01:16:35,833 --> 01:16:37,750
Yes! It's not like
I'm going to miss the carnival.

1399
01:16:37,833 --> 01:16:39,750
We're doing the carnival already,
we're dancing,

1400
01:16:39,833 --> 01:16:42,042
and like I just told you,
he wants me to come here.

1401
01:16:42,125 --> 01:16:45,375
I can't figure this out.
It's still mind boggling!

1402
01:16:45,458 --> 01:16:48,083
- Same here.
- Yes, it's confusing!

1403
01:16:48,167 --> 01:16:50,000
He said to tell you to call his friend,

1404
01:16:50,083 --> 01:16:52,250
- Da-- I can't--
- Dayo!

1405
01:16:52,333 --> 01:16:55,083
Yes, that you should call him.
You should call the police.

1406
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:57,708
You should come to our carnival.

1407
01:16:57,792 --> 01:16:59,792
- That the person that killed him is there.
- Okay.

1408
01:16:59,875 --> 01:17:02,583
That's not the point! The point is
you're intruding into my privacy

1409
01:17:02,667 --> 01:17:04,583
- and it's paining me. I can't--
- I'm sorry.

1410
01:17:04,667 --> 01:17:09,208
Leave me alone. Don't touch me.
Stop acting like you're powerful.

1411
01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:11,125
Dayo. Yes.

1412
01:17:11,208 --> 01:17:14,250
Look, there's a problem.
You have to come over right away.

1413
01:17:14,333 --> 01:17:15,333
Now!

1414
01:17:16,458 --> 01:17:18,625
Well, she's raving. She's here.

1415
01:17:18,708 --> 01:17:23,083
My name is Isla.
I'm not raving.

1416
01:17:23,167 --> 01:17:25,458
- Don't go.
- Get out of my way, please!

1417
01:17:25,542 --> 01:17:27,375
I said carnival is on.
You're saying don't go.

1418
01:17:27,458 --> 01:17:29,708
It seems you haven't been punched before.

1419
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,042
- Are you serious?
- Yes!

1420
01:17:33,125 --> 01:17:35,208
We need to do something now.
We need to do it quickly!

1421
01:17:36,042 --> 01:17:37,333
Do you believe this girl?

1422
01:17:37,417 --> 01:17:39,667
'Cause I've never seen anybody
that sees ghosts before.

1423
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:42,708
Dayo, I believe her. I believe her.

1424
01:17:42,792 --> 01:17:43,958
If you had seen her,

1425
01:17:44,042 --> 01:17:45,875
- you'd have felt what I felt.
- Okay.

1426
01:17:45,958 --> 01:17:47,833
She said that after carnival,
we may lose him,

1427
01:17:47,917 --> 01:17:50,458
- so we need to do something now, now, now!
- Okay.

1428
01:17:50,542 --> 01:17:52,708
Okay, the first thing I will do
is call the police.

1429
01:17:52,792 --> 01:17:55,625
Me and the police will go.
Oh, fantastic. Fantastic.

1430
01:17:57,542 --> 01:17:58,542
Oh, God.

1431
01:18:00,292 --> 01:18:04,125
Hello, sir.
Yes, it's me, Mike's friend, that died.

1432
01:18:04,208 --> 01:18:07,375
Yes, sir,
I have very important information for you.

1433
01:18:07,458 --> 01:18:09,042
Are you in the office?

1434
01:18:09,875 --> 01:18:13,083
Yes, thank you. I'll see you now.
Thank you.

1435
01:18:13,167 --> 01:18:14,333
Okay, good.

1436
01:18:14,417 --> 01:18:16,083
What's the number of the lady
who sees ghosts?

1437
01:18:16,167 --> 01:18:18,375
- Hold on.
- So if we get there, we'll call.

1438
01:18:18,958 --> 01:18:22,333
Okay, that's it. 0-7-0, yeah.

1439
01:18:24,583 --> 01:18:26,625
All right,
so I'm definitely going with you.

1440
01:18:26,708 --> 01:18:29,292
- Right?
- Yes, sure. Wait, wait.

1441
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:32,542
You're a lady. Why don't I go
with the police so you can be safe?

1442
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:34,083
- No, I'm going with you.
- Don't worry.

1443
01:18:34,167 --> 01:18:36,583
The person who killed Mike
will not go free.

1444
01:18:36,667 --> 01:18:37,750
- No, he can't.
- Not here.

1445
01:18:37,833 --> 01:18:40,375
Someone killed my helper, my assistance.
They can't go scot-free!

1446
01:18:40,458 --> 01:18:42,250
Don't worry! I will see you.

1447
01:18:42,333 --> 01:18:43,667
God bless you!

1448
01:18:44,375 --> 01:18:46,375
Yes, yes, yes.

1449
01:18:53,083 --> 01:18:56,667
Finally.

1450
01:19:15,583 --> 01:19:17,875
What's up?

1451
01:19:47,417 --> 01:19:50,167
Ajebo, calm down. Listen.

1452
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:51,333
- Calm down!
- Listen.

1453
01:19:51,417 --> 01:19:55,292
First and foremost, that's not my concern.
You've been over-dressing lately.

1454
01:19:55,375 --> 01:19:59,500
Lately-- Why are you showing off?
Do you want to expose us in this area?

1455
01:20:00,083 --> 01:20:01,292
Why do you act like this?

1456
01:20:01,375 --> 01:20:02,917
- Because I'm spending my money?
- Yes.

1457
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,000
My share, my percent?
The one we all shared.

1458
01:20:06,083 --> 01:20:08,458
Can you believe this?

1459
01:20:08,542 --> 01:20:13,417
- I'm a Yoruba man and we like to show off.
- Shut up!

1460
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,208
- So I'm jealous of you?
- You're very jealous.

1461
01:20:33,333 --> 01:20:34,958
Hey, hey, hey!

1462
01:20:35,042 --> 01:20:37,083
Hey! Police! Police!

1463
01:20:41,875 --> 01:20:47,208
Hey! Go back.
Stop the music. Stop the music.

1464
01:20:47,917 --> 01:20:50,292
Police! Hey, hey, hey!

1465
01:20:51,208 --> 01:20:53,583
Hey, police! Stop this!

1466
01:20:55,333 --> 01:20:59,792
I'm going home. The show is over!
I'm going home. The show is over!

1467
01:20:59,875 --> 01:21:01,958
I'm not performing again. I'm leaving.

1468
01:21:02,042 --> 01:21:04,542
I'm leaving. I'm leaving.
No more show!

1469
01:21:04,625 --> 01:21:08,125
No more show! I'm going!
I'm going! No more show!

1470
01:21:13,958 --> 01:21:17,167
No, no! Okay.

1471
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:18,375
Hey!

1472
01:21:18,458 --> 01:21:19,833
Let's go there.

1473
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:21,458
Hey, guys, guys!

1474
01:21:21,542 --> 01:21:23,292
No! I'm not here for that.

1475
01:21:23,375 --> 01:21:25,125
- Calm down.
- I'm not here for that!

1476
01:21:25,208 --> 01:21:27,208
You know you've messed up, right?

1477
01:21:27,292 --> 01:21:29,167
One of you has been talking.

1478
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:32,167
- How do you mean?
- Don't ask me questions.

1479
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:33,708
Do we look like Lasisi Elenu?

1480
01:21:33,792 --> 01:21:37,708
I said, which one of you has been
running their mouth about the Mike issue?

1481
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:39,958
Mike? Mike is dead.

1482
01:21:40,042 --> 01:21:43,625
I've had doubts about you guys
right from the time I gave you this job.

1483
01:21:43,708 --> 01:21:48,125
Even now, you're talking
and exposing our dealings.

1484
01:21:48,208 --> 01:21:51,500
- Nobody is saying anything.
- Okay. None of you said anything?

1485
01:21:51,583 --> 01:21:53,083
Okay, let me ask you a question.

1486
01:21:53,167 --> 01:21:54,667
Who is seeing ghosts here?

1487
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:56,750
Ghost?

1488
01:21:56,833 --> 01:21:58,833
- Do you see ghosts?
- I don't see ghosts.

1489
01:21:58,917 --> 01:22:00,167
- You see ghosts?
- Nobody does.

1490
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:01,750
- Does anyone in your family?
- No.

1491
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:05,167
- Whoever sees ghosts must die today.
- It shall be done.

1492
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:07,042
I'll kill Adunni myself.

1493
01:22:07,125 --> 01:22:10,208
You guys will kill the one
who sees ghosts. Take her number.

1494
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:11,667
Is this person crazy?

1495
01:22:11,750 --> 01:22:14,708
Relax, boss, we'll do the work for you.

1496
01:22:14,792 --> 01:22:16,125
Type the number.

1497
01:22:17,083 --> 01:22:18,583
Ajebo, type it quickly.

1498
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:19,917
This is unbelievable.

1499
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:23,083
Wow, Isla?

1500
01:22:23,875 --> 01:22:26,500
- Guys, the person is Isla.
- Isla?

1501
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:31,458
Oh! I said it!
I knew you were the informant!

1502
01:22:31,542 --> 01:22:33,708
- Relax, boss!
- What's the problem?

1503
01:22:33,792 --> 01:22:35,958
- Don't you know Isla?
- Calm down.

1504
01:22:36,042 --> 01:22:38,833
- Kafila's friend. She's at the carnival.
- Calm down.

1505
01:22:38,917 --> 01:22:41,583
Oh! Isla lives in this ghetto?

1506
01:22:41,667 --> 01:22:45,792
Okay, whether Isla or no Isla,
Kafila or no Kafila,

1507
01:22:45,875 --> 01:22:48,000
- you must kill Isla today.
- We're ready to get it done.

1508
01:22:48,083 --> 01:22:50,542
- I'm under a lot of pressure.
- What's wrong with you?

1509
01:22:50,625 --> 01:22:53,625
- What's wrong with me?
- Isla is also going to die.

1510
01:22:53,708 --> 01:22:54,750
Calm down.

1511
01:22:54,833 --> 01:22:59,167
All right. Now, kill Isla today
and I will kill Adunni today.

1512
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:00,458
It shall be done.

1513
01:23:21,417 --> 01:23:24,542
Please, I can drive any car. I beg you.

1514
01:23:24,625 --> 01:23:27,292
There's no vacancy here.

1515
01:23:27,375 --> 01:23:30,208
Please, let me drop off
this application letter for the manager.

1516
01:23:30,292 --> 01:23:32,125
Let me tell you something.

1517
01:23:32,208 --> 01:23:34,333
That's the boss. Get him before he leaves.

1518
01:23:34,417 --> 01:23:35,667
- Is that him?
- That's him!

1519
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:37,417
- Thank you.
- Go and meet him.

1520
01:23:41,125 --> 01:23:43,375
Greetings, sir.

1521
01:23:44,333 --> 01:23:47,792
- No, get up. Get up.
- No, let me talk like this, please.

1522
01:23:47,875 --> 01:23:50,125
- No, get up.
- Let me talk like this, please.

1523
01:23:50,208 --> 01:23:51,833
What's the problem? Get up.

1524
01:23:51,917 --> 01:23:56,833
Thank you. I'm looking for a job.
Please, any vacancy?

1525
01:23:56,917 --> 01:23:58,417
What's your qualification?

1526
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,167
Higher National Diploma. I have a HND.

1527
01:24:00,250 --> 01:24:01,583
- HND?
- Yes?

1528
01:24:01,667 --> 01:24:05,458
- And you want to be a driver?
- What can I do?

1529
01:24:06,167 --> 01:24:07,500
There's no white-collar job.

1530
01:24:07,583 --> 01:24:10,875
- So if it's blue- or black-collar job--
- It's okay. It's okay.

1531
01:24:10,958 --> 01:24:12,250
This is my application letter.

1532
01:24:12,333 --> 01:24:14,417
- What did you study?
- Public Admin.

1533
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:15,917
Public Administration!

1534
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,083
Yes, I studied Public Administration.

1535
01:24:18,167 --> 01:24:19,583
And you want to be a driver!

1536
01:24:19,667 --> 01:24:23,458
My brother, sir,
if there is no white-collar job,

1537
01:24:23,542 --> 01:24:25,917
- any color job that's available, I'll do.
- Okay.

1538
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,708
- Um...
- What is it?

1539
01:24:30,042 --> 01:24:33,417
- Okay, I have something for you.
- Thank you very much.

1540
01:24:34,333 --> 01:24:36,625
- Huh?
- I have something for you.

1541
01:24:36,708 --> 01:24:39,208
- For me?
- For you. Come on.

1542
01:24:39,292 --> 01:24:41,042
- I have something for you.
- Thank you.

1543
01:24:41,125 --> 01:24:44,542
- No! Don't do that.
- Thank you.

1544
01:24:44,625 --> 01:24:47,958
- You don't know what you've done for me.
- No, it's fine.

1545
01:24:48,833 --> 01:24:50,792
- Take it easy.
- Thank you very much.

1546
01:24:50,875 --> 01:24:52,917
- Stop. Can you just stop doing that?
- Okay.

1547
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:54,833
- Can you stop doing that?
- Okay, sir.

1548
01:24:54,917 --> 01:24:57,250
- Walk normal.
- Me?

1549
01:24:57,333 --> 01:24:59,667
- Yes. Walk normal. Now walk.
- Thank you, sir.

1550
01:24:59,750 --> 01:25:02,125
Hello, Dayo? How are you?

1551
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:05,292
Okay, good.

1552
01:25:05,375 --> 01:25:09,125
Because of the sensitive nature
of this business,

1553
01:25:09,208 --> 01:25:11,458
as discussed and agreed earlier,

1554
01:25:12,375 --> 01:25:17,417
I'm writing you a check of 35 million
naira to be paid into your account.

1555
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:20,375
Make sure you see to the transaction
with my client.

1556
01:25:20,458 --> 01:25:24,750
And remember,
this is strictly between you and I.

1557
01:25:24,833 --> 01:25:27,333
- Did you eat onions before coming here?
- Osas, talk to him.

1558
01:25:27,417 --> 01:25:30,167
- Guys.
- Calm down. How are you?

1559
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:31,750
- Welcome, boss.
- How are you doing?

1560
01:25:31,833 --> 01:25:33,583
- What's up?
- I'm all right.

1561
01:25:33,667 --> 01:25:36,750
- Guys, I don't want any fuck-ups.
- No worries.

1562
01:25:37,458 --> 01:25:39,417
- Collect it.
- This is your payment.

1563
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:41,583
- No fuck-ups, please.
- Ajebo, check it.

1564
01:25:41,667 --> 01:25:44,292
- No fuck-ups.
- This is the picture of the guy.

1565
01:25:46,125 --> 01:25:48,167
- I'll send it to your phone.
- Correct.

1566
01:25:48,250 --> 01:25:50,167
You understand. No fuck-ups, please!

1567
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:52,667
- Don't worry. We got you.
- Finish him off quickly.

1568
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:53,875
...you're telling me to leave?

1569
01:25:55,833 --> 01:25:58,125
Are you all crazy? Get in the car.

1570
01:25:58,208 --> 01:26:00,792
- Aren't you going to see them off?
- Why would I see them off?

1571
01:26:00,875 --> 01:26:02,833
Do I look like a guardian angel?
They've left already!

1572
01:26:02,917 --> 01:26:04,875
- Shut up!
- They've left! Leave me alone!

1573
01:26:04,958 --> 01:26:06,458
- Go! That's what I want.
- I'm not going.

1574
01:26:06,542 --> 01:26:07,750
You must do what I want. Go!

1575
01:26:07,833 --> 01:26:10,125
I won't cuddle you
because you don't deserve it.

1576
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:14,500
No problem, I'm leaving.
There's no problem.

1577
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:22,875
Hello?

1578
01:26:22,958 --> 01:26:25,417
Yes, the three of them are on their way.

1579
01:26:26,125 --> 01:26:28,792
Make sure you kill the three of them.

1580
01:26:30,708 --> 01:26:32,417
This guy isn't answering.

1581
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:33,792
Hello. What happened?

1582
01:26:33,875 --> 01:26:36,833
- Hello, boss.
- Are you stupid?

1583
01:26:36,917 --> 01:26:39,083
I said kill the three of them.

1584
01:26:39,167 --> 01:26:40,708
Get away from my phone!

1585
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,708
- New goods have arrived.
- Shh!

1586
01:27:11,792 --> 01:27:15,542
- I have a new phone for you.
- Exactly--

1587
01:27:15,625 --> 01:27:19,208
This one is iPhone S2ABC.

1588
01:27:19,292 --> 01:27:21,667
The phone was released just this morning.

1589
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:24,083
Nobody's bought the phone yet.

1590
01:27:24,167 --> 01:27:26,208
What are the phone's features?
You talk too much.

1591
01:27:26,292 --> 01:27:29,833
This is not an ordinary phone.
It dials you by itself.

1592
01:27:29,917 --> 01:27:32,792
The phone would dial me itself?
You mean the phone has my number?

1593
01:27:32,875 --> 01:27:34,917
If the phone is in one room
and you're in another,

1594
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,375
it will call you
to tell you someone called you.

1595
01:27:37,458 --> 01:27:41,292
- It's not like other phones.
- Stop shouting. Where is the phone?

1596
01:27:41,375 --> 01:27:46,042
Let me tell you its last feature.
If I tell you, you'll buy it on the spot.

1597
01:27:46,125 --> 01:27:49,833
The phone won't ask you for your name.
It already knows it.

1598
01:27:49,917 --> 01:27:52,000
- It knows my name?
- Yes. It will even sing for you.

1599
01:27:54,583 --> 01:27:55,875
Nkemjika?

1600
01:27:58,250 --> 01:28:00,375
I've been here since morning.
What's going on?

1601
01:28:04,083 --> 01:28:07,750
Can you see how valuable this phone is?

1602
01:28:07,833 --> 01:28:11,250
Are you sure you can afford it?

1603
01:28:11,333 --> 01:28:16,125
- How much is it?
- Let me see.

1604
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:21,000
Wait. Let me bring it out.
It's a very expensive phone.

1605
01:28:21,833 --> 01:28:24,625
What is it again?

1606
01:28:25,958 --> 01:28:27,250
- Kill me?
- Yes!

1607
01:28:28,333 --> 01:28:30,875
Who are you talking to?

1608
01:28:30,958 --> 01:28:32,208
She's crazy.

1609
01:28:33,417 --> 01:28:36,500
Are you okay?
Did you drink alcohol?

1610
01:28:36,583 --> 01:28:40,000
See you guys later.

1611
01:28:44,625 --> 01:28:48,583
Just give me 37,000. Let's do it quickly.

1612
01:28:49,875 --> 01:28:52,375
Hello. Something just happened right now.

1613
01:28:52,458 --> 01:28:53,958
Where's Isla?

1614
01:28:54,042 --> 01:28:56,042
- Where is Isla?
- Who is Isla?

1615
01:28:56,125 --> 01:28:58,292
- Where is Isla?
- What is Isla?

1616
01:28:58,375 --> 01:29:00,375
- Where is Isla?
- Who is Isla?

1617
01:29:00,458 --> 01:29:01,708
- Who?
- Where is Isla?

1618
01:29:01,792 --> 01:29:05,000
- Hey, stop shouting. Are you okay?
- Are you mad?

1619
01:29:05,083 --> 01:29:07,125
- Where is Isla?
- Are you selling goods?

1620
01:29:07,208 --> 01:29:09,667
Do you want to buy a phone?
I have phones for sale.

1621
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:15,208
He drank a lot of gin.
He's drunk and high.

1622
01:29:15,292 --> 01:29:16,667
Come on. Let's go.

1623
01:29:16,750 --> 01:29:18,750
DJ Kano, let's do it!

1624
01:30:27,417 --> 01:30:30,542
There's no point coming here
to fight or shout.

1625
01:30:30,625 --> 01:30:34,417
Because right now,
your man just came to meet me,

1626
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:36,042
that they want to kill me.

1627
01:30:36,125 --> 01:30:38,542
He said it was his best friend
that killed him.

1628
01:30:38,625 --> 01:30:39,625
What?

1629
01:30:40,375 --> 01:30:41,958
What is this? Leave me alone!

1630
01:30:42,042 --> 01:30:44,125
We're talking about death.
You're talking about hug.

1631
01:30:44,208 --> 01:30:46,625
- I guess you're not the cuddly type.
- What's "cuddly type"?

1632
01:30:46,708 --> 01:30:50,333
I've been drinking since morning.
There's nothing in my tummy.

1633
01:30:50,417 --> 01:30:53,500
I just came to let you know
that I'm stuck with you.

1634
01:30:53,583 --> 01:30:56,417
Nobody is going anywhere.
I don't know what I did.

1635
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:59,542
Anyway, he said I should tell you
that it's his best friend that killed him.

1636
01:30:59,625 --> 01:31:00,875
And they want to kill me, too.

1637
01:31:00,958 --> 01:31:04,542
Wait, wait, wait. Wait, hold on.
What did you just say now?

1638
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:06,708
He said his best friend
is the one that killed him.

1639
01:31:06,792 --> 01:31:08,417
No, no. No, he--

1640
01:31:15,458 --> 01:31:17,583
- Did somebody follow you?
- Nobody.

1641
01:31:17,667 --> 01:31:19,375
- Are you sure?
- I'm dead!

1642
01:31:19,458 --> 01:31:21,042
- Calm down.
- I'm calm.

1643
01:31:24,083 --> 01:31:25,417
Okay.

1644
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:28,417
Call this number.

1645
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:32,750
It's the police. Just go in there,
call the number. I'll handle it.

1646
01:31:32,833 --> 01:31:34,917
Shh. Be strong. Be strong.

1647
01:31:39,208 --> 01:31:42,958
He said I should tell you
that there's 35 million naira with him.

1648
01:31:45,417 --> 01:31:46,875
Yes, yes. Who's that?

1649
01:31:51,042 --> 01:31:53,417
Take a look at this perfume collection.

1650
01:31:58,250 --> 01:31:59,625
It smells great.

1651
01:32:00,542 --> 01:32:02,083
I'm in trouble!

1652
01:32:12,792 --> 01:32:14,292
Just about to get it.

1653
01:32:14,375 --> 01:32:16,042
- Dayo!
- I told you.

1654
01:32:16,125 --> 01:32:18,125
I told you it's a lie!

1655
01:32:18,958 --> 01:32:20,750
That girl seeing ghosts is shady.

1656
01:32:21,458 --> 01:32:25,875
She's scheming with some guys
to swindle you.

1657
01:32:26,375 --> 01:32:28,500
- I told you, you have to relax.
- What?

1658
01:32:28,583 --> 01:32:32,958
They're planning to get to know you,
see what you have and come and--

1659
01:32:33,042 --> 01:32:34,250
- What?
- Yes!

1660
01:32:34,333 --> 01:32:36,417
Is this a boutique?

1661
01:32:36,500 --> 01:32:40,792
This lady has enough clothes and perfume
to kill anyone.

1662
01:32:40,875 --> 01:32:42,250
This one is like water.

1663
01:32:42,333 --> 01:32:43,958
I'm in trouble!

1664
01:32:44,042 --> 01:32:50,583
If I owned this place,
I would die and rise every day.

1665
01:32:51,292 --> 01:32:52,792
She said I should...

1666
01:32:53,750 --> 01:32:56,750
I'm in trouble! The phone is locked!
I'm in trouble!

1667
01:33:00,125 --> 01:33:03,708
The phone is locked. The phone is locked.

1668
01:33:06,375 --> 01:33:08,125
Her phone is locked.

1669
01:33:09,583 --> 01:33:11,708
Let me go and-- Huh?

1670
01:33:12,958 --> 01:33:15,458
Wait. Aha.

1671
01:33:16,375 --> 01:33:18,083
Call the police.

1672
01:33:22,458 --> 01:33:23,792
That girl is a scammer.

1673
01:33:23,875 --> 01:33:28,000
See, Adunni, you need to be very careful.
You need to be very careful.

1674
01:33:28,083 --> 01:33:31,208
If you hear anything about Mike's death,
just call me.

1675
01:33:31,292 --> 01:33:33,583
Okay? That girl is a scammer.

1676
01:33:33,667 --> 01:33:36,500
I need to go because there's
so many things I should do.

1677
01:33:36,583 --> 01:33:38,750
I need to go, but just be careful.
She's a scammer.

1678
01:33:38,833 --> 01:33:40,958
- Okay.
- Dayo, hold on.

1679
01:33:41,042 --> 01:33:43,958
What do you know about 35 million naira?

1680
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,042
Did Mike give you any 35 million naira?

1681
01:33:47,125 --> 01:33:51,083
No, he didn't give me 35 million naira.
I lent him 35 million naira as a friend.

1682
01:33:51,167 --> 01:33:53,500
Because he's dead now,
there's nothing I can do about it.

1683
01:33:53,583 --> 01:33:55,333
I let go of the 35 million naira.

1684
01:33:55,417 --> 01:33:57,292
- I lent him 35 million naira.
- Dayo.

1685
01:33:57,375 --> 01:33:58,792
- Did he tell--
- Dayo?

1686
01:33:58,875 --> 01:34:01,333
- Yes?
- What do you know about Mike's death?

1687
01:34:02,375 --> 01:34:04,000
Mr. Policeman, pick up your phone.

1688
01:34:04,083 --> 01:34:06,875
You're not the only one
that likes Saheed Osupa. What's going on?

1689
01:34:06,958 --> 01:34:09,292
I'm dead today. That's for sure.

1690
01:34:10,208 --> 01:34:11,417
I'm dead!

1691
01:34:13,417 --> 01:34:14,792
Mr. Policeman.

1692
01:34:14,875 --> 01:34:16,917
This is Isla. Go to a quiet place.

1693
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:20,458
Get away from the noise. I can't hear you.

1694
01:34:23,542 --> 01:34:27,000
Mr. Policeman.
I'm not at the carnival. I left.

1695
01:34:27,083 --> 01:34:28,208
I'll tell you everything.

1696
01:34:28,292 --> 01:34:32,167
I went somewhere to help someone,
but now my life is in danger.

1697
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:37,292
The lady said that the person outside
has bad intentions towards us.

1698
01:34:37,375 --> 01:34:43,750
She asked me to call the police,
but her phone is locked.

1699
01:34:45,292 --> 01:34:47,125
We're in Lekki Phase 1.

1700
01:34:47,833 --> 01:34:52,083
Bashy Street. Number 5.

1701
01:34:54,375 --> 01:34:56,708
Mr. Policeman, I don't understand.

1702
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:59,250
Ijora, Lekki Phase 1.

1703
01:35:00,208 --> 01:35:02,125
Mr. Policeman, don't be like this.

1704
01:35:02,208 --> 01:35:06,125
You keep saying police is our friend,
but you don't know where we live.

1705
01:35:07,042 --> 01:35:09,167
Leave me alone.

1706
01:35:11,333 --> 01:35:15,458
I don't want to die. I don't want to die.

1707
01:35:26,333 --> 01:35:30,958
I still don't want to die.
I don't want to die.

1708
01:35:31,042 --> 01:35:32,750
Adunni, we're all looking for the killer.

1709
01:35:33,417 --> 01:35:36,125
Mike, my assistance, my helper,
we're looking for his killer.

1710
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,292
Sorry for the interruption.

1711
01:35:38,375 --> 01:35:43,250
Your perfume smells nice.

1712
01:35:43,333 --> 01:35:46,750
You said I should call the police,
but your phone is locked. So I called--

1713
01:35:46,833 --> 01:35:50,000
- Hey! You called the police?
- Oh, my God!

1714
01:35:50,083 --> 01:35:51,417
What are you doing with a gun?

1715
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:53,417
Come out here!
So you're the one seeing ghosts?

1716
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:55,667
- I'm not seeing anything.
- You're the one seeing ghosts?

1717
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:58,042
Dayo, calm down! You have a gun?

1718
01:35:58,125 --> 01:35:59,708
Okay, yes! Yes!

1719
01:35:59,792 --> 01:36:01,583
- Let me tell you.
- Just--

1720
01:36:01,667 --> 01:36:04,042
- Ohh!
- Calm down, everybody!

1721
01:36:04,125 --> 01:36:06,625
I'm the one holding the gun,
and you're telling me to calm down!

1722
01:36:06,708 --> 01:36:07,708
You're very foolish!

1723
01:36:08,333 --> 01:36:10,208
You're very foolish!
Let me tell you something.

1724
01:36:10,292 --> 01:36:12,917
You're the one seeing ghosts, right?
Ghost seer!

1725
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,750
I've never in my life
seen a ghost.

1726
01:36:15,833 --> 01:36:17,667
- Shut up!
- It's the ghost that's seeing me.

1727
01:36:17,750 --> 01:36:19,208
Let me tell you something
if you want to hear.

1728
01:36:19,292 --> 01:36:21,292
I killed Mike. Yes!

1729
01:36:22,042 --> 01:36:26,000
I killed him. Yes, because I envy him.
I'm jealous of Mike!

1730
01:36:26,083 --> 01:36:28,500
What is it?
Is Mike the only man in the world?

1731
01:36:29,208 --> 01:36:31,500
Mike's father, very rich.
Mike himself, very rich!

1732
01:36:31,583 --> 01:36:33,750
- He was your best friend!
- Will you shut up?

1733
01:36:33,833 --> 01:36:35,792
- If you say that again, I'll shoot you.
- I'm sorry.

1734
01:36:35,875 --> 01:36:38,125
Please let me go. I'm not part of this.

1735
01:36:38,208 --> 01:36:42,083
Mike gives me money to pay
whenever he buys something.

1736
01:36:42,167 --> 01:36:43,417
He thinks I'm a fool.

1737
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:47,917
He has already told everyone
that I'm spending his money.

1738
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,375
Mike! He must die in heaven again.

1739
01:36:50,458 --> 01:36:53,333
I'll sit on the 35 million naira!

1740
01:36:53,417 --> 01:36:55,500
How could you kill your best friend?

1741
01:36:55,583 --> 01:36:57,250
If you say that again, I'll blow your--

1742
01:36:57,333 --> 01:37:00,250
See, I will not kill you with gun.
Do you have shaving powder?

1743
01:37:00,333 --> 01:37:02,083
I'll put shaving powder
for the two of you.

1744
01:37:02,167 --> 01:37:04,875
- Do you have shaving powder?
- She has-- I have.

1745
01:37:04,958 --> 01:37:07,958
Let me go get it from my house. I have--

1746
01:37:08,042 --> 01:37:10,083
- Come back here!
- I'm dead!

1747
01:37:10,167 --> 01:37:13,875
You think I'm a fool?

1748
01:37:13,958 --> 01:37:16,375
- We don't think you're a fool.
- No. Don't worry.

1749
01:37:16,458 --> 01:37:17,875
You know that I killed Mike.

1750
01:37:17,958 --> 01:37:19,542
So you have to die.

1751
01:37:19,625 --> 01:37:21,208
The two of you have to die!

1752
01:37:21,292 --> 01:37:22,417
Wait!

1753
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:23,500
Yes!

1754
01:37:24,083 --> 01:37:25,833
Who called the police?

1755
01:37:25,917 --> 01:37:28,167
- She called the police.
- I-- You--

1756
01:37:28,250 --> 01:37:30,333
Stop this! Why did you call the police?

1757
01:37:30,417 --> 01:37:33,292
It is a toy gun!

1758
01:37:33,375 --> 01:37:34,875
I was only kidding with you!

1759
01:37:35,417 --> 01:37:36,958
Is this how you behave?

1760
01:37:37,042 --> 01:37:39,292
These people are stupid.

1761
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,083
I can use the rifle
better than you.

1762
01:37:46,167 --> 01:37:47,875
Hey! Hold it there!

1763
01:37:49,708 --> 01:37:51,167
I'll punch your eye!

1764
01:37:51,250 --> 01:37:52,667
Hey! Shut up!

1765
01:37:52,750 --> 01:37:54,500
Back up. Come on, come on.

1766
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:56,542
Come on.

1767
01:37:57,500 --> 01:38:00,625
Calm down.

1768
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:03,250
Who's talking?
