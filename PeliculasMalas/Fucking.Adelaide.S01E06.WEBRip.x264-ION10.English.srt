Shh!

The first guests will be here
in 10 minutes. What are you doing?

12
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:17,664
I'm hungry.

13
00:02:17,665 --> 00:02:21,744
Well, there is a helluva lot of party
pies and sausage rolls out there.

14
00:02:21,745 --> 00:02:23,615
You go and dig in.

15
00:02:26,224 --> 00:02:28,342
Cleo!
What'd she say?

16
00:02:28,343 --> 00:02:29,823
Is it time?

17
00:02:31,703 --> 00:02:35,863
Where's the... funeral... dead body...
bereavement assistant lady gone?

18
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,980
Yeah, Bianca,
she said she'd be back soon.

19
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:40,340
I don't think we could've done
these last few days without her.

20
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:42,341
I don't think
we could have done anything

21
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:43,939
without that death doula.

22
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,179
Do you think Mum knew

23
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,540
a natural home funeral
would be so much fucking work?

24
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:50,859
How's the eulogy going?

25
00:02:52,098 --> 00:02:54,977
Yeah, you want run anything
past us first?

26
00:02:54,978 --> 00:02:56,576
Me?

27
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:59,336
You don't want to say something?
Doesn't the oldest do it?

28
00:02:59,337 --> 00:03:00,777
Oh, you're the performer.

29
00:03:01,936 --> 00:03:03,935
Hey, I can't prepare a speech
in eight minutes.

30
00:03:03,936 --> 00:03:05,455
Are you seriously
not saying anything?

31
00:03:05,456 --> 00:03:06,776
Does it have to be me?

32
00:03:06,777 --> 00:03:08,654
I'll do it.
Great.

33
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:11,335
Yeah, that's... good.
That makes sense.

34
00:03:12,654 --> 00:03:14,214
What do I say?

35
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:20,012
All you have to do is just...

36
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:22,733
..think of some nice things
about Mum.

37
00:03:25,772 --> 00:03:27,370
OK.

38
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:29,131
Nice things.

39
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:34,691
Ah, like how she'd always let me
have that special cereal on Sundays.

40
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,210
Or, like, whenever she was
on the phone to you, Emma,

41
00:03:38,211 --> 00:03:40,448
and you'd be talking about work,
and she'd say,

42
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:44,209
"Stop it. You're making me so proud
I'm gonna start lactating again."

43
00:03:45,688 --> 00:03:47,408
You remember that?

44
00:03:51,726 --> 00:03:53,886
But we can't make this speech
about us.

45
00:03:55,246 --> 00:03:57,206
This speech has to be about her.

46
00:04:05,644 --> 00:04:08,162
It doesn't even look like our mother.

47
00:04:08,163 --> 00:04:12,683
We've spent three days with this body
and I hardly see her there anymore.

48
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:21,121
Her hair.

49
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,520
Ah...

50
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:29,158
..some of her hair came off.

51
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:31,237
OK.
Oh.

52
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:32,997
Emma, it's in my hand.
I'm gonna vomit.

53
00:04:32,998 --> 00:04:34,877
It's OK, give that to me.
Just sit down.

54
00:04:34,878 --> 00:04:37,278
You, um, you keep thinking
about those nice things.

55
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,076
Just keep thinking about that eulogy.
I'll fix this.

56
00:04:40,077 --> 00:04:41,715
Ah...

57
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:44,076
Yeah, the nice things. Um...

58
00:04:46,395 --> 00:04:49,274
There was that time
that she broke my teacup set

59
00:04:49,275 --> 00:04:52,465
and then every day after that
she would leave this peace offering

60
00:04:52,474 --> 00:04:54,034
of a new cup out the front of the...

61
00:04:56,393 --> 00:04:58,113
I can't say that.

62
00:05:00,912 --> 00:05:02,752
She liked...

63
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:08,391
What did Mum even like?

64
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:12,950
I still can't get used to it.

65
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:15,788
The smell.

66
00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:19,308
The smell of decomposing body isn't
that bad when it's someone you love.

67
00:05:19,309 --> 00:05:21,947
It's been three days already.

68
00:05:21,948 --> 00:05:24,347
Surely she should have been embalmed
or something?

69
00:05:24,348 --> 00:05:27,186
No, embalming
is environmentally unsound.

70
00:05:27,187 --> 00:05:29,906
Mum was very specific in her will.

71
00:05:29,907 --> 00:05:32,787
"And after five days,
the maximum you can keep me at home

72
00:05:32,788 --> 00:05:35,185
"without embalming or proper
refrigeration,

73
00:05:35,186 --> 00:05:37,746
"you will cover me
with a shroud of your choosing...

74
00:05:37,747 --> 00:05:39,784
"Kitty will know
the one that I like.

75
00:05:39,785 --> 00:05:42,615
"..and bury my body under the gum
in the backyard."

76
00:05:42,624 --> 00:05:44,584
Sorry.

77
00:05:45,703 --> 00:05:47,943
I still have no idea
which shroud she means.

78
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,581
Why are we even doing this?

79
00:05:52,582 --> 00:05:55,142
Why are we trying this hard
to follow her instructions?

80
00:05:55,143 --> 00:05:56,500
I mean...

81
00:05:56,501 --> 00:06:00,621
..do you think she knew it was
illegal to be buried in the backyard?

82
00:06:00,622 --> 00:06:02,580
Why did she even request that?!

83
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,140
If she gets buried
in the backyard...

84
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:08,738
She's not getting buried
under the fucking gumtree, Eli.

85
00:06:08,739 --> 00:06:10,859
IF she gets buried in the backyard,

86
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,658
doesn't that mean Geoff technically
owns the burial plot too?

87
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:19,297
The man relinquished all his rights
when he murdered our mother.

88
00:06:21,136 --> 00:06:23,455
But if he gets off...
He's in prison, he gets nothing!

89
00:06:23,456 --> 00:06:25,416
But if he got charged
with accidental death...

90
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:27,094
The coroner was very clear, Kitty.

91
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,455
But if he did get out...
He's not getting out!

92
00:06:31,214 --> 00:06:34,774
Everything that was Maude's
is solely ours now.

93
00:06:39,573 --> 00:06:41,853
And we're not burying her
in the backyard,

94
00:06:41,854 --> 00:06:43,532
we can't do everything she wants.

95
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:47,091
Wanted.

96
00:06:48,931 --> 00:06:51,451
But if she wanted to get buried
in the backyard,

97
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:54,730
doesn't that mean
she DIDN'T want to sell the house?

98
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:56,808
So if WE sell the house...

99
00:06:56,809 --> 00:06:58,409
..is that...

100
00:06:59,568 --> 00:07:01,208
..bad?

101
00:07:03,008 --> 00:07:07,006
Maybe she just didn't get
around to updating her will.

102
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:10,445
Maybe she... didn't want
any of this anymore.

103
00:07:10,446 --> 00:07:13,085
Well, it does say, um...

104
00:07:13,086 --> 00:07:14,684
"During this time

105
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:17,884
"family and friends should come
round to our beautiful house

106
00:07:17,885 --> 00:07:20,315
"for an afternoon,
to be able to view my body

107
00:07:20,324 --> 00:07:23,403
"and for a wonderful celebration
to say a final farewell."

108
00:07:23,404 --> 00:07:25,244
There's liquid dripping
from the bed.

109
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:27,562
"Our beautiful house."

110
00:07:27,563 --> 00:07:29,563
That sounds like
she wanted to keep it.

111
00:07:29,564 --> 00:07:30,961
Eulogy.
Liquid!

112
00:07:30,962 --> 00:07:32,362
What?

113
00:07:37,121 --> 00:07:38,760
There's a great big puddle.

114
00:07:38,761 --> 00:07:41,161
Is it the icepacks?
Tell me it's just melted icepacks.

115
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:43,039
Oh, she's leaking.
Oh, fuck!

116
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,360
Oh, my God, that smell.
How is that even possible?!

117
00:07:45,361 --> 00:07:47,598
Surely the coroner had to deal
with that stuff?

118
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,517
The coroner doesn't prepare anything,
Eli,

119
00:07:49,518 --> 00:07:51,717
the coroner just released Maude
to us, and me and Kitty,

120
00:07:51,718 --> 00:07:54,638
and Bianca, the death doula,
did all the body preparation.

121
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,156
As per Mum's wishes.
No thank you to you, Eli!

122
00:07:57,157 --> 00:07:59,837
Well, she's not going to care now,
is she? Can we just wait?!

123
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,315
Bianca will be back in a minute.

124
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:07,674
Well, clearly not, because
she should've been here already.

125
00:08:07,675 --> 00:08:09,185
Now, people are arriving

126
00:08:09,194 --> 00:08:11,674
so maybe we can we just
figure this out ourselves.

127
00:08:15,033 --> 00:08:17,112
Tampons.
Are you serious?

128
00:08:17,113 --> 00:08:19,631
No, no, Bianca said you could
use tampons for something like this.

129
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,711
One of you, get out your tampons.
Well, I don't have any.

130
00:08:21,712 --> 00:08:23,351
What do you mean
you don't have any tampons?

131
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:25,592
I thought I was only gonna be
in Adelaide for a couple of days.

132
00:08:25,593 --> 00:08:27,190
Kitty, do you have any?

133
00:08:27,191 --> 00:08:28,949
I don't know.

134
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,629
I moved out, remember?

135
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,869
Kitty, think.
Would Mum have any in here?

136
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,750
I have no idea.

137
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:39,349
Um...

138
00:08:41,628 --> 00:08:44,388
Surely our mother would've gone
through menopause by now.

139
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:45,706
Surely.

140
00:08:45,707 --> 00:08:48,667
God, I don't even know if our mother
went through menopause or not.

141
00:08:49,826 --> 00:08:51,505
This is gonna be the worst speech.

142
00:08:51,506 --> 00:08:53,345
Whatever you say, Kitty,
will be perfect,

143
00:08:53,346 --> 00:08:55,066
just get something down on paper
maybe.

144
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,384
Found some.

145
00:08:56,385 --> 00:08:58,655
Super tampons. Perfect.

146
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:00,583
How old do you think they are?
Does it matter?

147
00:09:00,584 --> 00:09:02,504
It doesn't matter. Kitty, eulogy.

148
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:05,902
I don't know what to say about her.

149
00:09:05,903 --> 00:09:08,303
There's a present here. For me.

150
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:15,662
Despite Eli and I having birthdays
two days apart

151
00:09:15,663 --> 00:09:18,581
she never made us
share the same birthday party.

152
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,818
Fuck!
No, that's great, just keep going.

153
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:26,059
No, we can't make this about us!

154
00:09:29,258 --> 00:09:31,498
This one's got an auto-tuner on it.

155
00:09:33,178 --> 00:09:36,858
Maybe... Why don't you just think
of a funny story?

156
00:09:39,016 --> 00:09:41,296
What, like when Mum started leaking?

157
00:09:51,054 --> 00:09:53,054
Eli, pass me another tampon.

158
00:09:54,213 --> 00:09:56,093
Kitty, a tampon!

159
00:10:01,252 --> 00:10:03,452
I remember when Mum tried to teach
me how to put in a tampon

160
00:10:03,453 --> 00:10:06,330
for the first time and...
I was really nervous...

161
00:10:06,331 --> 00:10:07,891
Mum?
No!

162
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,170
Just letting you know,
folks have started rocking up.

163
00:10:14,171 --> 00:10:16,008
Yeah, just some last-minute touches.

164
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:18,369
Cleo just wants to have a moment
before everyone else comes in.

165
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:20,047
Mm-hm.
You're messing up her hair.

166
00:10:20,048 --> 00:10:21,527
I know, Toby.

167
00:10:21,528 --> 00:10:24,608
Emma, let me help.
No, stop, no. No, no fixing from you.

168
00:10:24,609 --> 00:10:27,046
As you can see, we're just...
We're not quite ready

169
00:10:27,047 --> 00:10:28,967
so maybe if you two could come back
in a second.

170
00:10:28,968 --> 00:10:30,805
I just want a moment!
Yeah...

171
00:10:30,806 --> 00:10:34,206
..I get it, but we just need some
time with our mum first, darling.

172
00:10:34,207 --> 00:10:37,524
I just wanted to give this to her.
Don't take another step!

173
00:10:37,525 --> 00:10:38,995
No more yelling!

174
00:10:39,004 --> 00:10:41,003
I'm sorry for the yelling
but stay over there!

175
00:10:41,004 --> 00:10:42,403
What the hell?!

176
00:10:42,404 --> 00:10:44,802
Please just go!
What's wrong?

177
00:10:44,803 --> 00:10:48,161
I haven't had a moment!
I understand.

178
00:10:48,162 --> 00:10:50,361
Can somebody please take her
out of here?

193

Oh, it was a slave song.

194
00:12:03,547 --> 00:12:06,466
It's a mother singing about
her own child not being cared for

195
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:08,947
while she sings for the owner's baby.

196
00:12:11,626 --> 00:12:14,024
That doesn't make sense.

197
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:15,705
Why would Mum sing that?

198
00:12:25,303 --> 00:12:27,741
You guys ready?

199
00:12:27,742 --> 00:12:29,622
Got lots of people out here.

200
00:12:31,342 --> 00:12:32,982
You OK?

201
00:13:47,846 --> 00:13:50,926
Whoa.
I don't know how that got there.

202
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,000
Kitty! Kitty! Kitty!

203
00:14:23,119 --> 00:14:25,078
Ah, hi, everyone.

204
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:29,237
Um... thank you so much
for coming today to celebrate Maude.

205
00:14:29,238 --> 00:14:30,718
Um...

206
00:14:33,557 --> 00:14:36,837
..I don't quite know
how to start this but, um...

207
00:14:38,516 --> 00:14:40,155
..ah...

208
00:14:40,156 --> 00:14:43,956
..um... we didn't want to make
this speech just about us.

209
00:14:45,395 --> 00:14:48,945
And I didn't want to make it
about him and what he did...

210
00:14:51,793 --> 00:14:53,313
And, um...

211
00:14:54,953 --> 00:14:58,273
..but all I can think of
is that Maude loves us.

212
00:15:00,392 --> 00:15:03,392
Loved us.

213
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:11,188
I'm sorry. I never cry.

214
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:14,149
Kitty! Kitty! Kitty!

215
00:15:28,266 --> 00:15:29,586
Sorry.

216
00:15:31,705 --> 00:15:33,385
Um...

217
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:40,544
..one time I came back... early...

218
00:15:41,623 --> 00:15:43,983
..and I didn't tell Mum.

219
00:15:45,022 --> 00:15:47,221
I wanted to surprise her.

220
00:15:47,222 --> 00:15:51,302
I had prepared a big speech
about how well I was doing in Sydney,

221
00:15:51,303 --> 00:15:54,900
how great my life was
since I last saw her,

222
00:15:54,901 --> 00:15:56,941
how proud she'd be of me.

223
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,900
Ah, so I came around the back
to just where you are standing now

224
00:16:02,901 --> 00:16:04,779
and I spotted her.

225
00:16:06,618 --> 00:16:08,898
She was right...
just right there...

226
00:16:12,017 --> 00:16:14,777
..and she was smoking a joint.

227
00:16:17,656 --> 00:16:21,454
And she seemed so... happy

228
00:16:21,455 --> 00:16:23,615
and content, just...

229
00:16:25,014 --> 00:16:27,014
..smoking by herself.

230
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:30,374
I didn't know she smoked.

231
00:16:31,813 --> 00:16:33,292
Did you know?

232
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:35,333
Did you know?

233
00:16:37,012 --> 00:16:38,811
Did any of you know?

234
00:16:38,812 --> 00:16:40,492
Yeah.

235
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,769
None of us knew.

236
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,969
Why didn't she want us to know?

237
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,888
So I walked back around
to the front of the house

238
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:51,889
and knocked on the door.

239
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,328
"Surprise."

240
00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:55,487
And she WAS surprised.

241
00:16:55,488 --> 00:16:57,607
And she was really proud of me

242
00:16:57,608 --> 00:16:59,728
and everything I'd been doing.

243
00:17:08,446 --> 00:17:10,206
This isn't fair.

244
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:16,683
Because I always told Maude

245
00:17:16,684 --> 00:17:19,764
that I would only come back to
Adelaide for Christmases and funerals

246
00:17:19,765 --> 00:17:21,923
and now I haven't broken that pledge.

247
00:17:25,122 --> 00:17:27,162
Maybe I should've a long time ago.

248
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:33,721
Maybe we all could have had
a joint together.

249
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,640
Maybe we still can.

250
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:43,239
Maybe I'll stick around.

251
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,958
So can I make one final suggestion?

252
00:17:49,437 --> 00:17:51,277
Can we go look for Maude's stash?
