1
00:00:00,103 --> 00:00:01,825
"Prehistoric Worlds"

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,809
Earth, a planet seemingly born

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,049
to create life, to nurture it,

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,093
to be shaped and colored
by it and to shelter it.

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:19,579
And yet, of all the organisms
that have ever lived

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:24,499
on Earth, 98.5% have gone extinct,

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,009
because our splendid
sanctuary has been visited

8
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:32,010
by the apocalypse, five times in all.

9
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:41,729
Everything we see on Earth
today is the end survivor

10
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,539
of at least one or maybe
more mass extinction events.

11
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,520
We are the descendants

12
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:48,170
of those who survived extinction.

13
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,139
Five times,
nearly every living thing was wiped

14
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,823
off the face of the planet,

15
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,400
five hells of ice and fire,
devastation in the seas,

16
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,913
on land and in the air above.

17
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,269
After each mass extinction,

18
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,009
there's always winners, survivors

19
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,126
that proliferate to become
the rulers of the Earth.

20
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,929
After each annihilation, the handful

21
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,893
of survivors gave rise to
an explosion of life forms.

22
00:01:34,973 --> 00:01:36,159
You have to imagine organisms

23
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,499
that are radically
different to those of today,

24
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,053
with some extraordinary forms.

25
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,630
From the beautiful

26
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:50,119
to the bizarre, and with an arms race

27
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:55,120
of predator and prey leading
inevitably to giants,

28
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,309
these are the stories
for Earth's lost worlds

29
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:04,539
and the fantastic lives and fearsome deaths

30
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,540
of its wondrous creatures.

31
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,779
At least 3 1/2 billion years ago,

32
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,683
life got a toehold on
a still hostile Earth.

33
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:43,309
Perhaps in a boiling volcanic
pool somewhere on the planet,

34
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:48,310
microbes were born, for all we
know, alone in the universe.

35
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,239
Marvelous forms of life would evolve

36
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,269
and colonize every corner of the planet

37
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,049
in a precarious balancing act,

38
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:04,519
an equilibrium so fragile
that a few degrees of change

39
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,504
in the world's temperature
could mean disaster.

40
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,263
And so it happened,

41
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:17,052
some 450 million years ago,

42
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:20,433
that the first great dying took place.

43
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,209
{\an8}At the time, during a period known

44
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:29,349
{\an8}as the Ordovician, the continents clustered

45
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,093
{\an8}in the Southern Hemisphere.

46
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:36,469
{\an8}Thanks to temperatures just two
degrees warmer than today's,

47
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,859
{\an8}the icecaps were almost
non-existent, and the oceans,

48
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,393
{\an8}some 600 meters higher
than their current level.

49
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,116
{\an8}It was a very different world to ours.

50
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,989
The continents were
barren, but in the seas,

51
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,959
after billions of years of
simple microscopic life,

52
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,799
extraordinary creatures appeared.

53
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,713
The oceans played host to
the first earthly paradise.

54
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,789
Life is boomin'.

55
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,099
It's blowin' and goin' in the
oceans, for sure.

56
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,269
So in the Ordovician sea,
you had animals like trilobites,

57
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,149
like little pillbugs.

58
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:18,983
Trilobites are moving around.

59
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:19,816
They have eyes.

60
00:04:19,816 --> 00:04:20,649
They have legs.

61
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:22,239
They have segmented body parts.

62
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,949
And they're cruisin'
around on the seafloor,

63
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,609
eating organic matter or
other smaller animals.

64
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,419
You also have corals,
not the same ones we have today

65
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,909
but different kinds of corals.

66
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,099
And there's a group of
animals called the crinoids,

67
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,559
which we call sea lilies,
because they look like plants,

68
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,339
but they are in fact animals.

69
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,589
They have a place where
they attach to the seafloor.

70
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:45,279
They have a long stem.

71
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,269
And it looks like a flower, but in fact,

72
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,720
it is the body of the animal.

73
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,409
In this first Eden,

74
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,729
at once familiar and
strange, the shallows teem

75
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:00,323
with creatures going about their business,

76
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:07,351
like these fish,
some of the first creatures with bones.

77
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:15,053
And these conodonts,
which looked like tiny eels.

78
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,779
But the conodonts' paradise was not

79
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,679
without truly terrifying hunters,

80
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,675
like the cephalopods,
ancestors to the octopus.

81
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,039
These are nasty marine predators.

82
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,979
If you are out swimming
with one of those things,

83
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,389
it's not a pleasant concept,

84
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,999
to be eaten by a squid.

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,119
I mean, it's reverse calamari, right?

86
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,339
The calamari eats you.

87
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,149
For millions of years, life proliferated

88
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,223
in the waters around the continents.

89
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,629
But for reasons we still don't understand,

90
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:05,309
the ocean temperatures
dropped by four degrees,

91
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,083
causing an abrupt and brutal ice age.

92
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,559
{\an8}Evaporated seawater that reined down

93
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,319
{\an8}on the land no longer
flowed back to the sea.

94
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,175
{\an8}It accumulated as ice.

95
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,919
{\an8}As the ice grows, the sea level goes down.

96
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,076
And so if you live in the
shallow marine ecosystems,

97
00:06:29,077 --> 00:06:31,839
and you have a freezing
period, which starts

98
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,169
to move the water from
the oceans on to land ice,

99
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,399
you decrease the area
where animals can live,

100
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,642
and you can get extinctions.

101
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,249
After this first cold wave,

102
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,343
temperatures started to climb again.

103
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,529
The ice melted and sea levels rose.

104
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,179
These climate convulsions
pounded the already

105
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,279
weakened creatures that
still clung to life.

106
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,529
And the one-two punch of cold and hot put

107
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:15,664
in motion the first mass
extinction in Earth's history.

108
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,209
By the end of the Ordovician,

109
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,229
85% of species had been wiped out.

110
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:36,719
But a handful of hardy
survivors made it through,

111
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,819
including some of the primitive bony fish,

112
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,159
which would navigate a singular pathway

113
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,703
through the tree of life,

114
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,893
one for which we should
be eternally grateful.

115
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,729
It's descendants branched out to give rise

116
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,723
to all the vertebrates
that have ever existed.

117
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,763
Without it, no dinosaur would
ever have walked the Earth.

118
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,503
No bird would have taken wing.

119
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,933
And no mammals or reptiles
would ever have emerged.

120
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:31,219
And there would be no humans
telling the story of life.

121
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,879
After this first mass
extinction and the ones to come,

122
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,529
life branched out into
billions of different forms,

123
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,729
each family, each group,
each species being part

124
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,659
of a vast spreading tree.

125
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,539
There's always winners in
the lottery of extinction.

126
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:51,139
And whatever those survivors are,

127
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,639
that's where the next radiation happens.

128
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,129
That's where the next
evolutionary burst happens.

129
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,309
So if you want a simple way to think

130
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,749
about extinctions on planet Earth is,

131
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,639
the survivors are the winners,

132
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,549
and their descendants are the ones

133
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,685
that populate the next time period.

134
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,010
The desolation

135
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:13,779
of a mass extinction sets the stage

136
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,243
for an evolutionary renaissance.

137
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,649
Within tens of millions of years

138
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,959
of the Ordovician catastrophe,

139
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,293
the survivors had given rise to a new
era, the Devonian.

140
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,189
It was a completely new world,

141
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,113
full of new prey and new predators,

142
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,663
some quite astounding.

143
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,979
In the sea, we call it the Age of Fishes,

144
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,959
because now the fishes have evolved,

145
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,198
and they're diversifying,
and you get some whoppers.

146
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:56,419
And one of the greatest fishes

147
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,733
of all time is this animal
called Dunkleosteus.

148
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,969
Dunkleosteus is the super predator

149
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:13,970
of the Age of Fish,
right at the top of the food chain.

150
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,119
It probably swam in a constant search

151
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,763
for large enough meals,

152
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,080
even specimens of its own kind.

153
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,009
In the natural history museum in Paris,

154
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:41,010
a plaster cast of Dunkleosteus'
impressive jaw testifies

155
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,529
to the killing power of
this giant of the Devonian.

156
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:49,763
This is the well-honed
weapon of a fearsome hunter.

157
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:57,059
Paleontologist Gael
Clement studies placoderms,

158
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,653
the large family to which
Dunkleosteus belongs.

159
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,490
{\an8}This animal's part

160
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:07,769
{\an8}of the group called placoderms, which means

161
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,509
{\an8}that they have thick,
bony plates under their skin.

162
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,779
Here, we see the jaw,
with these sharp points,

163
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,839
which are not teeth,
because teeth didn't exist yet.

164
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,169
It's actually the jawbone,
which presents this pincer form,

165
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,673
so it can crush and chop up
the prey in which it fed.

166
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:29,659
And while Dunkleosteus terrorized the seas,

167
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,335
the continents were being transformed.

168
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,699
The beginning of it, on land,
they're little, tiny things,

169
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,459
and by the end there were forests.

170
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:46,069
The Devonian is when you
get a land environment

171
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,529
that starts to look like
something you might recognize.

172
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,322
You go from nothing to forests.

173
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,880
But trees release water vapor into the air

174
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,783
and may have triggered epic
storms over the continents.

175
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:14,489
Torrents swept dead and
decomposing plant matter

176
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,073
into the oceans, choking them.

177
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,793
Oxygen levels plummeted.

178
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,029
Global cooling and volcanic
turbulence may have

179
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:29,873
worsened the crisis in the seas, as well.

180
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,343
For marine life, sustenance grew scarce.

181
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,217
Eventually, the food chain collapsed.

182
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:55,170
The Devonian extinction strangled 3/4

183
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:58,750
of the worlds marine life to death.

184
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,073
But on land, the forests kept thriving.

185
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,459
Any creature looking
to survive the disaster

186
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:12,869
at sea would have to seek
greener pastures, literally,

187
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:17,399
and that would require
some anatomical innovation.

188
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,209
So you have a variety of fish

189
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:22,469
that actually are
maneuvering their way around,

190
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:26,969
in shallow water,
and they have these lobe-like fins,

191
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,386
that actually, if you look at the fossils,

192
00:13:28,387 --> 00:13:30,839
and actually you can start to see the rays

193
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,359
of the fins actually have distinct bones,

194
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,979
and it's this lineage of fish

195
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,963
that eventually evolves into amphibians.

196
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,399
With the seas suffocating

197
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,393
and the lush land beckoning,
the menu required updating.

198
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,489
Pioneering fish like Tiktaalik,

199
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,899
a descendant of the bony fish that slipped

200
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,669
through the first mass extinction,

201
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:07,199
had already been experimenting with life

202
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,322
where the shallows meet the land.

203
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,649
It had gills to breathe in water

204
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:19,409
but also a primitive lung for breathing air

205
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:23,973
and four robust fins that
would later become legs.

206
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:36,699
Fleeing the choking oceans,
Tiktaalik and its family,

207
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,199
the sarcopterygians crept out of the water

208
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,543
and slithered through the
second great extinction.

209
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,723
And the world would never be the same.

210
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:54,333
A new chapter in the history of life began.

211
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:01,159
And again, in the race of
life, the winners give rise

212
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,513
to new branches of the evolutionary tree.

213
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,619
In the new age of the Permian,

214
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,093
the first modern trees developed.

215
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,593
Photosynthesis enriched
the air with oxygen.

216
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,869
{\an8}At the same time,
the continents drifted together

217
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:44,870
{\an8}to form a supercontinent,
Pangaea, a vast new territory

218
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:49,683
{\an8}for land-going animals
to explore and exploit.

219
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,489
Animals unlike anything
the world have ever seen

220
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:59,259
before evolved to handle
life on terra firma,

221
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:03,529
where conditions like temperature
varied much more wildly

222
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,583
and harshly than in the seas.

223
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:08,679
To protect their offspring,

224
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,409
big predators like the Gorgonopsians began

225
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:14,543
to lay the first eggs with hard shells.

226
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,979
All the early land animals
walked on four legs,

227
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,963
hence the name tetrapods,

228
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:27,159
a body plan that's as revolutionary

229
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,483
as any in the story of life.

230
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,393
And some were quite flamboyant.

231
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:39,169
What you got are animals
that looked like a big iguana

232
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,319
with a great big sail on its back.

233
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,129
It's likely that these sails were

234
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:48,130
for either impressing the other sex

235
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,909
or for moderating heat.

236
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,899
You could rotate towards the sun,

237
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,619
and your blood is warmed up
by this big warming surface,

238
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,769
or you could rotate away from the sun.

239
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:57,973
You can cool it down.

240
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,649
These pelycosaurs, with their iconic sails,

241
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,053
lived alongside dicynodonts,

242
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:23,039
herbivores with a new innovation, a beak,

243
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,703
designed to excavate the
tough roots on which they fed.

244
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,859
These huge animals were probably hunted

245
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,312
by the biggest predators in Pangaea.

246
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,223
Like the Titanophoneus, or titanic killer,

247
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,183
a reptile that could grow
to a length of five meters.

248
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,299
In the seas,
100 million years after the collapse

249
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,263
of the oceans, vibrant,
new lifescapes flourished.

250
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,879
You would've just loved
scuba diving in the Permian,

251
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,609
and you got all these incredible creatures

252
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:20,679
that are out swimmin' around.

253
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,729
There's corals.

254
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,169
There's cephalopods.

255
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,529
The fishes have gotten big now,

256
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:26,180
and you've got your first sharks.

257
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,629
Certainly one of the most amazing

258
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:32,603
is this animal called Helicoprion.

259
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,189
It basically had this
whirl of teeth mounted

260
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:41,299
in its lower jaw,
and it would slam into its upper jaw,

261
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,979
and it was a slicing mechanism.

262
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,086
It swam around in the sea,

263
00:18:45,087 --> 00:18:46,649
and it just chopped stuff in half

264
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,189
and then came back and ate it.

265
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,809
The massive fossilized teeth

266
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:57,519
from this buzzsaw shark
suggest it could've grown

267
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,703
to a length of 12 meters.

268
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,689
On land and in the water,

269
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:11,129
the biodiversity of the
Permian was simply spectacular.

270
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,103
But it was doomed.

271
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,889
The most devastating natural catastrophe

272
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:28,729
the Earth has ever seen
so far awaited them,

273
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,489
a cataclysm that would
transform this paradise

274
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,782
into hell on earth for millions of years.

275
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:51,559
Some 250 million years ago,
in what is now Siberia,

276
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,963
the Earth tried to turn itself inside out.

277
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,289
These vast cliffs, called traps, formed

278
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:02,793
when the planet belched
lava, over and over again,

279
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,183
for tens of thousands of years.

280
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:18,469
Iceland, one of the most
volcanically active countries

281
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:22,694
in the world,
is entire built by lava flows.

282
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:29,069
It is an open-air laboratory for geologists

283
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:32,549
like Patrick De Wever,
and embedded in the rock,

284
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:36,413
he finds the barrels of a
lava flow's smoking guns.

285
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,939
When there's an emission of lava,

286
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,526
{\an8}there are holes in the mass of rock,

287
00:20:43,527 --> 00:20:45,389
{\an8}and these holes are filled with gases,

288
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,329
{\an8}which come out at the
same time as the magma.

289
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,799
{\an8}There are different types of gas.

290
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,859
There's water vapor.

291
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,210
There are sulfur oxides and carbon dioxide.

292
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:59,059
We know water vapor is a greenhouse gas,

293
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,699
which tends to raise the temperature,

294
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,223
as does carbon dioxide.

295
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,273
But sulfur oxides have a double effect.

296
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,749
On the one hand, they cause acid rain,

297
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,900
and they also partially block out sunlight,

298
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,919
leading to a drop in temperature
and lower light levels,

299
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,519
which means a reduction in photosynthesis

300
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,523
and so perhaps fewer plants.

301
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,689
And since animals feed on plants,

302
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,019
fewer plants mean herbivores start to die,

303
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,302
and then in turn,
the carnivorous animals die, too.

304
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:41,949
The Permian-Jurassic
extinction was the mother

305
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,369
of all extinctions.

306
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,329
Basically, a lot of our
friends that had been with us

307
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:49,282
for the entire Paleozoic,
things like trilobites,

308
00:21:49,283 --> 00:21:51,149
the last trilobite goes.

309
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:54,109
Lots of these earlier marine organisms,

310
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:57,669
they've survived through much
of the earlier extinctions,

311
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,845
sorry, can't make it through.

312
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,719
On the other side of the world,

313
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,049
in China's Zhejiang Province,

314
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:10,139
researchers Sylvie Crasquin

315
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,749
and Marie-Beatrice Forel are
in search of one creature

316
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,853
that survived the Permian
disaster in the seas,

317
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:22,233
hoping to find the secrets
of how to cheat extinction.

318
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,839
Here, at the dividing line
between the abundant Permian

319
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,919
and the disaster-ravaged time just after,

320
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,593
the researchers locate
what they're looking for,

321
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,682
tiny crustaceans called ostrocods.

322
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,189
Ostrocods had an ability to adapt to some

323
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:53,159
of the most stressed environments

324
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,793
in the history of the planet.

325
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,419
In her Paris laboratory,

326
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:05,203
Sylvie puts her prizes
under the microscope.

327
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:10,319
Ostrocods from before the
disaster are pretty large

328
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,299
for miniature marine life.

329
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,273
The ones from immediately after are not.

330
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:21,769
{\an8}Just after the crisis,

331
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,039
{\an8}conditions were extremely harsh.

332
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,619
{\an8}You can imagine that ostrocods went

333
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:29,129
{\an8}into energy-saving mode,
meaning they reduced the metabolism

334
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,889
as far as possible to consume less energy,

335
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:34,029
which is why you find smaller ones,

336
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,069
which also had smaller eggs,

337
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:38,139
and with reproductions
cycles that are much shorter

338
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,323
than those usually
observed in the Paleozoic.

339
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,969
After the devastation of the Permian,

340
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:57,993
life hit the reset button once again.

341
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:02,859
On land, the few tetrapods that survived,

342
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,879
descendants of the first
land-going vertebrates,

343
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:10,223
would evolve into reptiles,
dinosaurs and mammals.

344
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:21,969
Millions of years later,
by the start of the Triassic,

345
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:26,594
the branches of the tree of
life are once again blossoming.

346
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:46,209
The Triassic is a time
of tremendous innovation,

347
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:49,309
because the decks have
been cleared so severely

348
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,220
in the Permian-Jurassic.

349
00:24:50,221 --> 00:24:53,340
So you basically wipe the slate not clean

350
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,566
but pretty clean.

351
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:07,749
The Triassic is this really crazy place

352
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,852
where these things now radiate again

353
00:25:09,853 --> 00:25:12,549
into all these different
kinds of shapes and forms,

354
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,953
lots of really cool,
weird animals in the Triassic.

355
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:22,059
In the ocean, marine reptiles had emerged,

356
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,705
like the ichthyosaurs,

357
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,883
which roamed the seas,
hunting fish and squid.

358
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:42,413
Corals bloomed and built reefs once again.

359
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:49,530
Ammonites proliferated,
along with sea urchins and starfish.

360
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:18,819
In the skies above,
the first flying reptiles

361
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,883
called pterosaurs beat their huge wings.

362
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:34,569
On land, great herbivores with
tough leathery armor grazed

363
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:35,570
in conifer forests.

364
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:47,379
Their defensive carapace
hints at the presence

365
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:51,319
of fearsome predators,
like the agile Coelophysis,

366
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,493
which probably hunted in packs,

367
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:57,349
the two-legged,
40-pound Coelophysis was one

368
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:00,752
of the first dinosaurs to grace the earth.

369
00:27:02,065 --> 00:27:04,729
It would take tens of millions of years

370
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:07,209
and another global catastrophe

371
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:11,450
before giant dinosaurs
completely dominated the world.

372
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:31,379
{\an8}Some 200 million years ago,
Europe and Africa tore away

373
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,623
{\an8}from the American continent,
forming the Atlantic Ocean.

374
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:41,303
The Earth entered a new
period of volcanic upheaval.

375
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:47,299
It set in motion the fourth mass extinction

376
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,673
in the planet's history,

377
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,920
wiping out 3/4 of land-dwelling species

378
00:27:58,349 --> 00:28:00,849
and 96% of ocean species.

379
00:28:03,563 --> 00:28:06,963
And the great Permian
experiment lay in ruins.

380
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:13,119
But once again,
life would rise like a phoenix

381
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,120
from the ashes.

382
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,019
The dinosaurs survived.

383
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,224
The mammals survived.

384
00:28:18,225 --> 00:28:19,909
The pterosaurs survived.

385
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:23,639
So on land, you have these lineages now

386
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,335
that are off and racing.

387
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:49,129
In the highlands of Central South Africa,

388
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:52,229
the rocks preserve a
record of this renaissance

389
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,679
and a world dominated by some

390
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,583
of the most massive
animals that ever existed,

391
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,154
the mega-dinosaurs.

392
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:13,229
Paleontologist Jonah Choiniere

393
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,909
and his students from
Witwatersrand University

394
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:18,919
in Johannesburg are excavating fossils

395
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,859
from the Triassic and Jurassic periods

396
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,633
that may shed light on this
revolutionary transition.

397
00:29:32,327 --> 00:29:34,410
It'll come out.

398
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,589
While his students extract a fossil

399
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:41,839
from the Triassic, Jonah goes in search

400
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,233
of sediments from the Jurassic.

401
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,049
These rocks in this
cliff, these are Jurassic.

402
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:50,309
So they're about 200 million years old.

403
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,849
{\an8}Down below us, on the Triassic,

404
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:54,189
{\an8}all types of animals
are found in the rocks,

405
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:56,349
{\an8}but as we come up into the Jurassic,

406
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,089
dinosaurs become much more common.

407
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:01,019
In fact, almost everything
we find here is a dinosaur.

408
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,169
Immediately after the extinction event,

409
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:05,729
dinosaurs are small,
but just for a short time.

410
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:08,389
Suddenly, they explode
into enormous body sizes.

411
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,609
And in fact, within a few million
years, you have things

412
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,464
that are twice the size
of today's elephants.

413
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,899
In the Triassic, it's anyone's game.

414
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,729
But as soon as we get into the Jurassic,

415
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:24,300
it's clear that dinosaurs
are the winners of the day.

416
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,769
Okay, slowly, gently.

417
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,988
One, two, three.

418
00:30:34,989 --> 00:30:36,322
You guys okay?

419
00:30:38,101 --> 00:30:38,934
Hey, guys.

420
00:30:38,934 --> 00:30:39,887
Hey, just in time.
<v ->Hi!

421
00:30:39,888 --> 00:30:41,663
You flipped it, fantastic.

422
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:45,579
Okay, we've taken bigger ones down before.

423
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,725
Okay, you ready, on three, two, three.

424
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,369
Most of the fossils collected

425
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:00,379
in South Africa,
in the past century, are housed

426
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:03,733
at Witwatersrand
University in Johannesburg.

427
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:09,029
The wealth of this collection
underlines the sheer variety

428
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:11,501
of species during the Jurassic.

429
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,619
The fossils on these shells are the bones

430
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,799
of Ladumarahi Mafube,
a giant dinosaur from South Africa,

431
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,519
which lived in the Jurassic Period,

432
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,439
about 200 million years ago.

433
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,429
And this is the foot bone
of Ladumarahi Mafube.

434
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:38,089
This is the only known
specimen of Ladumarahi,

435
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,569
and we'd been looking in South Africa

436
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:42,483
for well over 150 years, for dinosaurs.

437
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:48,119
The name Ledumahadi means
a giant thunderclap,

438
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,379
and Mafube, which is the species
name, means dawn,

439
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,979
so together, it's a Sesotho term,

440
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,523
meaning a giant thunderclap at dawn.

441
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,119
We can tell from these bones
that this animal weighed

442
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,009
about 12 tons, and that's amazing,

443
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,969
because it shows that dinosaurs soon

444
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:08,219
after the end Triassic extinction were able

445
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,063
to rebound and attain enormous sizes.

446
00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:18,249
We can tell from the bones of Ledumahadi

447
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,259
that it must've walked on all four legs,

448
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,479
in fact, much like a modern elephant,

449
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,409
but with a slightly more
crouched limb posture.

450
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:27,869
This type of dinosaur is a sauropodomorph,

451
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,399
and we know that they had long necks

452
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,789
and tiny heads and giant bodies

453
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:34,486
where they would've fermented
the food they swallowed whole.

454
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,969
Dinosaurs like Ledumahadi
would've made tremendous advantage

455
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,819
of the openings in the environment

456
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,569
and the ecosystems left vacant

457
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,502
by the end Triassic extinction.

458
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:06,809
After life was almost
wiped out in the Permian,

459
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:10,252
fascinating new creatures emerged on stage.

460
00:33:19,758 --> 00:33:21,909
With the arrival of flowering plants

461
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:26,273
and pollinating insects,
evolution went into overdrive.

462
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,159
The development of new species

463
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,193
sparked the genesis of others.

464
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:37,573
Herbivores grew larger
and more diversified,

465
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,678
along with the carnivores that fed on them.

466
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:06,319
These gigantic suarapods
were the biggest land animals

467
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,370
that have ever lived.

468
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:15,489
Some of them as much as 100 feet long,

469
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:18,769
20 feet tall, up to 88 tons,

470
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:21,143
these massive, incredible animals.

471
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,959
During the Cretaceous,

472
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,323
evolution went to extremes.

473
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,003
The jaw of the T-Rex exerted so much force,

474
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:38,783
it could crush the bones of its
prey and swallow them whole.

475
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,289
The largest flying creatures

476
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:51,403
the Earth has ever seen ruled the skies,

477
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:57,300
pterosaurs, whose wing
span could reach 12 meters.

478
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,799
And in the oceans,
creatures also grew immense,

479
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:14,783
like plesiosaurus, a ferocious predator.

480
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,159
And then there was the mosasaur,

481
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,747
a reptile that grew up to 18 meters.

482
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:45,929
The dinosaurs dominated
the face of the Earth

483
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:49,593
for more than 175 million years,

484
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,543
covering two geological periods,

485
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,903
the Jurassic then the Cretaceous.

486
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:07,669
Today, their only descendants are birds.

487
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:11,089
Once again, a cataclysm shook the planet

488
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:13,272
and brought the giants low.

489
00:36:23,233 --> 00:36:26,059
{\an8}As the Cretaceous drew to its close,

490
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,963
{\an8}the world began to
resemble the one we know.

491
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:35,469
{\an8}But India, which was not yet
joined to the Asian continent,

492
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:38,949
{\an8}underwent a massive volcanic
episode like the one

493
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:41,653
{\an8}in Siberia that ended the Permian.

494
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:50,869
The Deccan Traps bear witness to eruptions

495
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,993
that occurred over several millennia.

496
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,869
They date from some 65 million years ago,

497
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:02,753
around the time that the
dinosaurs disappeared.

498
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,129
Until the 1980s,

499
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:09,609
many scientists attributed
the dinosaurs' extinction

500
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,693
to this volcanic outburst.

501
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:17,580
Then came a theory that was
out of this world, literally,

502
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,529
that the dinosaur killer
was an extraterrestrial.

503
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,929
In 1980, this crazy idea was proposed

504
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:36,159
that an asteroid hit the planet

505
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,819
and caused the extinction
that wiped out the dinosaurs.

506
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:42,559
And we all thought, that's nuts.

507
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,159
That's like National Enquirer science.

508
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,379
Little green men come take our dinosaurs,

509
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,819
asteroid strikes, give me a break.

510
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,623
So everybody laughed,
thought this is a joke.

511
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,319
A joke that scientists would be forced

512
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,006
to take seriously.

513
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,879
In the badlands of Western Canada,

514
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,369
paleontologist Francois Therrien

515
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:11,579
from the Royal Tyrrell
Museum makes his way down

516
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:15,083
through millions of years
of fossil-rich sediments.

517
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,349
This valley,
carved out by the Red Deer River,

518
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:27,703
has yielded thousands
of dinosaur skeletons.

519
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:34,559
And one layer of sediment
bears the reddish signature

520
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,073
of a dinosaur killer.

521
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:43,189
So we can see here this
salmon-colored rock here.

522
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:46,149
This line marks the end of
the age of the dinosaurs

523
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:48,303
and the beginning of the age of mammals.

524
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,699
For geologists and paleontologists,

525
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,899
this line here represents a
record of a catastrophic event,

526
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,949
a meteorite impact,
that occurred 66 million years ago.

527
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:04,179
At the base of the layer,
we have the last pollens

528
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,369
of the last plants that grew
at the end of the Cretaceous,

529
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:11,029
followed by iridium,
which is an element extremely rare

530
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,129
at the surface of the Earth

531
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:14,679
but extremely abundant in meteorites.

532
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:18,361
This line here marks the
extinction of the dinosaurs.

533
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:24,719
And still, at the end of the 20th century,

534
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,409
not all researchers accepted the theory

535
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,523
of an extraterrestrial impact.

536
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:34,123
It would've left a massive
scar somewhere on earth.

537
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,993
So where was the crater?

538
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:42,109
Scientists began looking for it,

539
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:45,919
analyzing and dating each
major crater they could find,

540
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,789
but none coincided with the
extinction of the dinosaurs.

541
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:55,219
In the end, it was two
geologists from an oil company

542
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:58,289
who discovered it by chance.

543
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:01,449
Nestled in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula,

544
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:04,109
half hidden by the waters off the coast,

545
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,823
lay a crater more than 100 miles across.

546
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:11,353
It was 66 million years old.

547
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,719
And the horrors of the
most famous extinction

548
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,303
of all could no longer be denied.

549
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:24,580
So if you were on planet
Earth 66.02 million years ago,

550
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:28,069
walking around in a beautiful forest,

551
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:30,333
triceratops is grazing next to you,

552
00:40:32,584 --> 00:40:34,769
you were worried you might
run into a Tyrannosaurus rex,

553
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:35,889
but you don't see one right now,

554
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:38,773
life is good, trees are flowering,

555
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,683
suddenly, in an instant, a blinding light,

556
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,697
and you're dead.

557
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,409
The asteroid impact was an amazing thing,

558
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:02,719
because unlike all the other extinctions

559
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:07,720
that preceded it,
this one was global and instant.

560
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:11,759
It took a second or two for the asteroid

561
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,786
to pass through the
atmosphere, on the way in.

562
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,109
The asteroid, of course, is gone.

563
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,599
It's vaporized.

564
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,449
It's now molten rock,
shattered, target rock.

565
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:29,379
All that stuff blows back out,

566
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:33,269
through the hole in the
atmosphere, into low-Earth orbit.

567
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:35,089
The Earth rotates underneath it.

568
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:37,629
And then all that debris
starts to rain back

569
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,819
into the atmosphere.

570
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:43,119
As it rains back in, it heats
up, and the sky gets hot.

571
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,329
The heat from the sky makes it

572
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:46,012
to the ground and starts fires.

573
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,589
So no matter where you are on earth,

574
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:59,590
within hours,
you are feeling some serious hurt.

575
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,729
If you're anywhere in North
America, forget about it.

576
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:04,779
The initial explosion takes care of you.

577
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:05,760
There's smoke.

578
00:42:05,761 --> 00:42:07,259
There's dust.

579
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,049
Blocks out the sunlight.

580
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:11,379
If you're a plant,
there's no photosynthesis.

581
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,059
If you were a big animal,

582
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,879
if you survive the initial
blast somewhere on earth,

583
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,049
there's probably nothing to eat.

584
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:19,890
You probably don't make it
through the first winter.

585
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,289
A magnitude 13 earthquake,
a gigantic tsunami,

586
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:38,779
the raining blocks of rock

587
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,919
that are flown for hundreds of miles,

588
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,849
and the oceans have taken
a great insult as well.

589
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:46,709
The chemistry of the oceans have changed.

590
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:50,229
The phytoplankton were
turned off for months.

591
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:52,734
The zooplankton have then crashed.

592
00:42:52,735 --> 00:42:55,375
The marine food system is down.

593
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:04,863
In total, 3/4 of species vanished forever.

594
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:10,469
All the big dinosaurs
were wiped off the map.

595
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:20,629
But while the titans
died, the stage was set

596
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:24,887
for some tiny survivors
to take over the world.

597
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:33,879
The Royal Tyrrell Museum is home to one

598
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:36,799
of the world's largest
dinosaur collections,

599
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,673
including a specimen of
the most terrifying of all,

600
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:43,603
Tyrannosaurus rex.

601
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:54,619
But here, scientists are also resurrecting

602
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,393
the little animals that
would inherit the Earth.

603
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:04,359
Craig Scott,
head of conservation and research,

604
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,899
studies the mammals of the Paleocene,

605
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,453
the time just after the fifth extinction.

606
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,759
I'm essentially a paleo-dentist,
because the vast majority

607
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,951
of specimens that I examine are teeth.

608
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,609
The fossil record of mammals
is largely a dental record.

609
00:44:24,610 --> 00:44:27,069
You do get the occasional jaws,

610
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:29,329
and sometimes you get some
postcranial remains as well,

611
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:32,419
but for mammals of this age and older,

612
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,372
the record is primarily dental.

613
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,549
Well, from looking at these teeth,

614
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:43,579
I can tell from the shapes of the cusps

615
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:47,919
that this animal was probably
eating some resistant foods,

616
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,489
maybe really hard insects,

617
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:52,079
or it might have even
been crushing mollusks,

618
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,543
so the shells of snails and clams.

619
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:58,329
And I can also tell by looking at the teeth

620
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:00,989
that they have a very good resemblance

621
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:04,663
to living relatives of
hedgehogs and shrews.

622
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:11,030
Those mammals

623
00:45:11,031 --> 00:45:14,139
that survived the fifth mass
extinction were no larger

624
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,759
than a rat, but the fossils

625
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:20,319
that Craig Scott is analyzing
illustrates the speed

626
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:22,749
with which they evolved, diversified

627
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:27,750
and became giants,
exploiting the ecological niches

628
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:31,693
once monopolized by the dinosaurs.

629
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:37,209
So this is the skull of an
animal called a pantodont,

630
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:40,059
and pantodonts were large,

631
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:42,479
almost hippopotamus-like herbivores

632
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,903
that lived during the
Paleocene and the Eocene.

633
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,899
They represent the group of mammals

634
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:51,629
that achieved the largest body
size during the Paleocene.

635
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:53,069
And some of these animals made it up

636
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:54,913
to the size of a very large cow.

637
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:05,099
So within 15 million
years or 20 million years

638
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,829
after the extinction event,
mammals went from animals

639
00:46:08,830 --> 00:46:13,329
that had an average body size
of maybe a small rabbit up

640
00:46:13,330 --> 00:46:16,619
to something that's similar
to living hippopotamuses.

641
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,399
So that's quite a leap.

642
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,199
And a mere 10 million
or so years after that,

643
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,599
mammals got even larger,

644
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,419
and they achieved body sizes equivalent

645
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,036
to living elephants and rhinoceroses.

646
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:51,269
The great extinction
events were revolutions

647
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:54,929
in the story of life, because the thread

648
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:59,930
of life never completely
snapped, and five times,

649
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,313
cataclysms opened up new
worlds to the survivors.

650
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:09,929
After each, new branches on
the tree of life would bloom

651
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:12,784
and fill the void left by the dead.

652
00:47:28,660 --> 00:47:30,389
And across the Earth,

653
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:34,819
that little shrew-like animal
multiplied, transformed

654
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:38,473
and became all the fantastic
mammals we know today.

655
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,623
Some even returned to the seas.

656
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:02,339
They evolved into unique forms and adapted

657
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,643
to every climate, every environment.

658
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,469
Side-by-side, with other survivors,

659
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:14,849
they created a world
as colorful and diverse

660
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,185
as any that had gone before.

661
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:26,433
This is the sixth earthly
paradise, and it is uniquely ours,

662
00:48:27,790 --> 00:48:31,219
because one among this mammalian multitude,

663
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:36,220
a species of primate rose up
on its hind legs to dominate

664
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:41,009
and remake the earth like
no other species before it.

665
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:44,269
Some lineages were important in times past

666
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:46,899
and disappeared,
because they didn't survive extinctions,

667
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,749
but what we have today
is this composite world.

668
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:52,069
Humans and trees and whales

669
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:54,589
and fish and birds and primates,

670
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:57,109
you can go back,
in their individual lineages

671
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:59,889
and find out when their lucky moment was.

672
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:03,079
When did their ancestors
survive key extinctions?

673
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:03,913
When was their point

674
00:49:03,914 --> 00:49:06,889
when their ancestors
radiated and diversified?

675
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:08,903
And we're all survivors,
at this point in time.

676
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:17,529
Human beings now study the forces

677
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:20,503
of nature that propelled them to dominance,

678
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:25,829
a restless Earth with a
volatile and vulnerable climate,

679
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:29,769
an equilibrium we know
to be alarmingly fragile,

680
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:33,259
supporting a complex web of life,

681
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:36,119
all on a home where death could come

682
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,243
from the skies, in an instant.

683
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:44,669
But the next mass extinction
may already be upon us,

684
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:49,670
and for the first time,
it may be more akin to mass suicide.

685
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:08,529
Previous crises have
all had a natural cause.

686
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:11,129
They were either caused
by volcanic eruptions,

687
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:13,569
meteorite impacts or a climate change.

688
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:15,069
The difference with this crisis is

689
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:17,629
it's 100% caused by humans.

690
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:20,539
As such, it's happening
at a much faster rate,

691
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:22,499
and it's far less predictable.

692
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,429
Right around every extinction we've seen,

693
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:27,759
one or a couple of species
surges in dominance.

694
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,209
And that's what we're seeing today,

695
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:31,689
with humanity taking off at the expense

696
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:33,097
of other animals on the planet.

697
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:46,299
The timescale that we're talking about now

698
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:49,909
for the current crisis is
incredibly, incredibly fast,

699
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:51,409
much, much faster than anything

700
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:53,579
that we've experienced before.

701
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,319
Mankind is destroying its own planet

702
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,809
at a phenomenal rate.

703
00:50:56,810 --> 00:50:58,419
Even at our human scale,

704
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:00,785
we can see species becoming extinct.

705
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,949
Whatever happens,
life will regenerate on Earth.

706
00:51:10,950 --> 00:51:12,989
And it'll only take a few million years.

707
00:51:12,990 --> 00:51:15,349
But what the actors
will be in that new play

708
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:18,819
that plays out over the
future of life on this planet,

709
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:20,277
it's anyone's guess.

710
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,879
On the unimaginable timescale

711
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,039
of our planet's evolution,

712
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,893
we now know that history repeats itself.

713
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:34,369
And the lesson of that history is clear.

714
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:36,709
When catastrophe strikes,

715
00:51:36,710 --> 00:51:40,083
molten, frozen or hell from the heavens,

716
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:45,999
the creatures that dominate
will likely vanish,

717
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,429
but the Earth itself will not,

718
00:51:48,461 --> 00:51:51,463
and life will always find a way.

719
