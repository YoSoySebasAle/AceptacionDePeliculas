00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:25,018
There are all sorts of ways
to hit a cue ball.

3
00:00:28,121 --> 00:00:29,655
The thing you're trying to do

4
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:31,590
is send it
in a particular direction,

5
00:00:31,624 --> 00:00:35,494
to hit another ball and drop
that ball into a pocket,

6
00:00:35,528 --> 00:00:38,999
but it's where you send
the cue ball next

7
00:00:39,032 --> 00:00:42,768
that separates you
from the others.

8
00:00:42,802 --> 00:00:44,371
When you first start playing,

9
00:00:44,404 --> 00:00:46,806
you think it's only
about that one ball.

10
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:51,311
You can put backspins,
sidespin or topspin on a ball,

11
00:00:51,345 --> 00:00:54,780
or you can make it stop
on a dime, bounce off a rail.

12
00:00:54,814 --> 00:00:59,485
You can hit a ball soft, hard,
or just give it a little kiss.

13
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:01,221
You can send a ball
behind another ball

14
00:01:01,254 --> 00:01:04,358
to make it hard for
your opponent to make a shot.

15
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:08,428
Once you have the skills,
you can do any of these things.

16
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:25,644
Some dads take their kids
to church or to the ball game.

17
00:01:25,678 --> 00:01:27,580
That's what some dads do.

18
00:01:35,389 --> 00:01:37,991
My dad?
He took me to pool halls,

19
00:01:38,025 --> 00:01:42,895
and he taught me how to play
a game called 9-ball.

20
00:01:42,929 --> 00:01:44,364
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

21
00:01:44,398 --> 00:01:46,199
Mm!
Alright, fellas.

22
00:01:46,233 --> 00:01:47,401
I tell you what.

23
00:01:47,434 --> 00:01:48,834
We'll put my watch
against your $50.

24
00:01:48,868 --> 00:01:51,238
It's worth three...
five times more than that.

25
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:53,572
Wait, hold on.
What are you doing?

26
00:01:53,606 --> 00:01:54,673
What do you say?

27
00:01:54,707 --> 00:01:56,909
Me and my sentimental,
watch-loving son

28
00:01:56,943 --> 00:01:58,345
against you two fellows,

29
00:01:58,378 --> 00:01:59,845
and I tell you what
because we... we are...

30
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,914
No, Dad. Dad, come on.
That's your grandpa's watch.

31
00:02:01,948 --> 00:02:03,649
- Zip it. Zip it.
- It costs...

32
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:08,455
Sorry.

33
00:02:08,488 --> 00:02:12,558
Why don't you run and get me
a pack of cigarettes?

34
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:14,227
That shirt really brings
out your eyes.

35
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:16,063
Here is to your grandpa.

36
00:02:19,565 --> 00:02:22,202
Nice watch.

37
00:02:22,235 --> 00:02:25,372
Nine-ball, succession pool...

38
00:02:25,405 --> 00:02:28,375
where you got to
knock them down in order.

39
00:02:28,408 --> 00:02:30,743
This is truly a sport.

40
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:35,115
It takes skill,
and, more importantly...

41
00:02:35,148 --> 00:02:38,952
it takes foresight.

42
00:02:38,985 --> 00:02:40,954
Ah, come on!

43
00:02:40,987 --> 00:02:44,224
I love $50.

44
00:02:44,257 --> 00:02:47,294
Nine-ball... sport of kings.

45
00:02:47,327 --> 00:02:48,828
What do you say, fellas?
Double or nothing?

46
00:02:48,861 --> 00:02:50,596
- Yeah, not this time.
- I don't think so.

47
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:52,832
Well, thank you so much
for your patronage.

48
00:02:55,701 --> 00:02:57,770
Could have at least
saved me a shot.

49
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,805
Well, I tell you what,

50
00:02:59,839 --> 00:03:02,775
next game, you shoot first.

51
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,411
Now, how about you get us
a couple drinks?

52
00:03:04,444 --> 00:03:06,146
My treat.

53
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:29,336
Hey, kiddo, I didn't realize
how late it was.

54
00:03:29,369 --> 00:03:31,538
Your mom is gonna have my hide.
Let's skedaddle.

55
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:32,973
Come on, let's just stay
a little bit longer?

56
00:03:33,006 --> 00:03:34,640
I'll let you drive.

57
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,143
Awesome.

58
00:03:41,982 --> 00:03:44,884
Chip?

59
00:03:44,917 --> 00:03:46,019
Yeah.

60
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:53,126
Ah, damn it, go!
Go, Dallas!

61
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,894
Aah!

62
00:03:54,928 --> 00:03:56,829
Jesus, easy, boy!

63
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,202
Dallas, I ain't
telling you again.

64
00:04:02,235 --> 00:04:04,237
Get up.

65
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:05,671
You're not staying home
from school,

66
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,840
so you get that out
of your head right now.

67
00:04:34,568 --> 00:04:38,004
Hey, I need your help cleaning
out the shed after dinner.

68
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:40,839
- Can't.
- Is that so?

69
00:04:40,873 --> 00:04:44,777
Dad has got a game
with some guys from Kentwood.

70
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,414
- Forget it.
- He wants me there.

71
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,251
Dad, tell her what
the deal is tonight.

72
00:04:51,284 --> 00:04:54,753
You're not going,
and that's the end of it.

73
00:04:54,787 --> 00:04:56,523
We'll see.

74
00:04:56,556 --> 00:04:59,626
Yeah, we will see,
won't we?

75
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,904
Did you even hear that?

76
00:05:14,007 --> 00:05:15,508
Hey!

77
00:05:29,422 --> 00:05:31,224
That's trouble, you know.

78
00:05:31,258 --> 00:05:34,661
You never help me
discipline him.

79
00:05:34,694 --> 00:05:36,730
He is barely squeaking
by in school!

80
00:05:36,762 --> 00:05:38,465
He's fine.

81
00:05:38,498 --> 00:05:39,566
By your standards, maybe.

82
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:42,269
Did it ever occur to you

83
00:05:42,302 --> 00:05:43,902
to be his parent
instead of his playmate?

84
00:05:48,108 --> 00:05:50,010
Just one cup of coffee.

85
00:05:50,043 --> 00:05:52,145
He's doing fine.

86
00:05:52,178 --> 00:05:54,381
What do you mean by that?

87
00:05:56,116 --> 00:05:58,151
Well, what I mean is

88
00:05:58,184 --> 00:06:01,787
he's doing fine, Gina.

89
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,126
I thought you'd had enough
of this shit when you was a kid.

90
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:07,594
Damn it, Gina, don't.

91
00:06:07,627 --> 00:06:10,796
I know the road you're going
down. Don't do it.

92
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:14,634
Shit!
I'm gonna be late again.

93
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:16,469
We need to talk.
I mean it.

94
00:06:16,503 --> 00:06:19,306
I'm not worried, Gina.

95
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:44,863
I can't just leave work
like that

96
00:06:44,897 --> 00:06:46,566
every time you cause
a problem at school.

97
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:49,369
I'm gonna lose my job
over your little stunts!

98
00:06:59,679 --> 00:07:01,481
Oh, God.

99
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:08,421
Mom?
Mom, let me see.

100
00:07:08,455 --> 00:07:09,922
- Dallas.
- Mom, let me see!

101
00:07:09,956 --> 00:07:11,558
Dallas!

102
00:07:16,763 --> 00:07:18,365
Honey...

103
00:07:24,204 --> 00:07:26,539
You know how your daddy can get!

104
00:07:40,954 --> 00:07:42,389
Your daddy around?

105
00:07:43,957 --> 00:07:46,292
No.

106
00:07:46,326 --> 00:07:48,894
- He say when he'll be back?
- No.

107
00:07:48,928 --> 00:07:53,400
Well, why don't
that surprise me?

108
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:57,036
Well, tell him Earl stopped by.

109
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,772
He'll know why.

110
00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:13,720
I always thought I was gonna
have a big life...

111
00:08:13,753 --> 00:08:18,057
nice house,
two cars, three kids.

112
00:08:18,091 --> 00:08:19,759
Just like on the TV.

113
00:08:21,928 --> 00:08:23,930
- This is it.
- Let's face it.

114
00:08:23,963 --> 00:08:26,232
He hasn't been good
to you in forever.

115
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:29,169
Only part of my dream
that come true is Dallas.

116
00:08:29,202 --> 00:08:31,237
You know how you know
when it's over, Sandy?

117
00:08:31,271 --> 00:08:32,572
They stop kissing you.

118
00:08:32,605 --> 00:08:35,575
Better no man
than a worthless one.

119
00:08:35,608 --> 00:08:37,477
Who you calling worthless,
Sandy?

120
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,745
Dallas.

121
00:08:38,778 --> 00:08:40,113
I see the way
you flirt with him.

122
00:08:40,146 --> 00:08:41,581
Oh, please.

123
00:08:41,614 --> 00:08:42,849
And you... you...
you wonder why he takes off!

124
00:08:42,882 --> 00:08:44,150
You're bad-mouthing him
all the time.

125
00:08:44,184 --> 00:08:45,351
That is not fair!

126
00:08:45,385 --> 00:08:46,486
It's true.
You drove him away!

127
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,954
Go to your room.
Go!

128
00:08:47,987 --> 00:08:51,257
I don't want to hear
another word out of you, go!

129
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:52,625
Get!

130
00:11:13,099 --> 00:11:15,735
Well, look at what
the cat drug in.

131
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,571
She's a beaut.

132
00:11:18,605 --> 00:11:20,607
Yeah.
You seen Cal around, Jackie?

133
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,243
Earlier.
You two aren't together?

134
00:11:24,277 --> 00:11:25,946
Can I get a drink?

135
00:11:32,987 --> 00:11:34,320
So if you're not
with your dad,

136
00:11:34,354 --> 00:11:35,622
how'd you get here anyway?

137
00:11:35,655 --> 00:11:38,959
Yo, Dallas!
You're up.

138
00:11:38,993 --> 00:11:42,096
Coming.
Be right back.

139
00:11:42,128 --> 00:11:44,098
Good because I'm not done
with you yet.

140
00:11:49,869 --> 00:11:51,871
Wait, you're Dallas?

141
00:11:51,904 --> 00:11:55,943
Last time I checked, and, uh,
you must be Wayne.

142
00:11:55,976 --> 00:11:59,545
No, kid.
No, this isn't Toys "R" Us.

143
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:01,314
We're playing for money here.

144
00:12:03,182 --> 00:12:04,651
Nine-ball, it's the bottom
of the break.

145
00:12:04,684 --> 00:12:06,619
Call your last shot.

146
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:08,521
Let's rack them.

147
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:27,674
Oh.

148
00:12:27,707 --> 00:12:30,643
Believe you just lost all that
paper-route money, kid.

149
00:12:43,523 --> 00:12:45,092
Oh!

150
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:47,995
I... I do believe this is
what they call "ball in hand."

151
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:49,862
so, uh, let's see.

152
00:12:49,896 --> 00:12:55,035
If I were a cue ball,
where would I want to be?

153
00:12:55,069 --> 00:12:56,669
I don't know, Wayne.
What do you think?

154
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,671
Because, you know, I got a lot
of different options here.

155
00:12:58,705 --> 00:13:01,374
You know, I could take a shot
on that side pocket right there.

156
00:13:01,407 --> 00:13:05,179
Maybe I could spice some things
up and try and do a bank.

157
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:06,546
Ooh!

158
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:08,681
I'm not gonna feel so bad
about whooping your narrow hide.

159
00:13:08,715 --> 00:13:10,683
Well, uh, you want
to make it $40,

160
00:13:10,717 --> 00:13:13,586
so you can take me
a real good lesson?

161
00:13:13,619 --> 00:13:14,754
Done.

162
00:13:14,787 --> 00:13:17,124
Oh, my, the heat is on.

163
00:13:17,157 --> 00:13:18,591
Ahh.

164
00:13:25,298 --> 00:13:26,733
Excuse me.

165
00:13:34,074 --> 00:13:36,210
Nine-ball,
one rail, corner back here.

166
00:13:36,242 --> 00:13:37,777
Never happen.

167
00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:44,884
- Oh!
- Oh!

168
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:46,819
Never is a long time.

169
00:13:46,853 --> 00:13:49,957
Afraid not.
You didn't call a pocket.

170
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,791
Yes, I did.
I... I pointed to the...

171
00:13:51,824 --> 00:13:55,095
He didn't call it,
did he, Seth?

172
00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:58,297
Anybody else hear him call it?

173
00:13:58,331 --> 00:14:00,067
Seems like we all
on the same page.

174
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,136
You're a dick.
You know what I said.

175
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:03,770
Bar ain't no place
for a kid, nohow.

176
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:07,607
The boy called it right.

177
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,176
This old man talking to me?

178
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:11,911
Uh, no disrespect,
but I did hear him.

179
00:14:11,945 --> 00:14:13,446
I don't see how this is
any of your concern.

180
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:16,783
Well, you asked everyone,
and I believe I qualify.

181
00:14:16,816 --> 00:14:19,452
Consider yourself
disqualified.

182
00:14:19,485 --> 00:14:21,021
Is that right?

183
00:14:21,054 --> 00:14:23,756
This boy beat you
fair and square.

184
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:27,326
Hey, boy, that's enough.

185
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,762
Jackie's right.

186
00:14:29,796 --> 00:14:32,099
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

187
00:14:32,132 --> 00:14:34,134
Come on, get back.
Mnh-mnh.

188
00:14:38,571 --> 00:14:40,339
Take your money, son.

189
00:14:45,478 --> 00:14:48,347
Oh, damn it.

190
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,297
What was that?

191
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:06,332
Why don't you just mind
your own business?

192
00:15:06,365 --> 00:15:08,302
Yeah, okay.

193
00:15:08,334 --> 00:15:11,737
Uh, listen, why don't you just
tell me you live

194
00:15:11,771 --> 00:15:13,040
within a reasonable distance,

195
00:15:13,073 --> 00:15:14,841
and I'll take you home
to your mama?

196
00:15:14,874 --> 00:15:16,342
I don't have a mama.

197
00:15:17,743 --> 00:15:21,014
I... I mean...
I mean, she died.

198
00:15:21,048 --> 00:15:23,649
So who... who do you stay
with then, boy?

199
00:15:23,683 --> 00:15:27,054
My dad, but, uh, you know,
he... he had to go somewhere.

200
00:15:27,087 --> 00:15:28,554
You know, he left me
with a buddy of his.

201
00:15:28,588 --> 00:15:30,257
You know, he didn't realize
what a drunk the guy was.

202
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,993
You know, he... he beat the crap
out of me earlier.

203
00:15:33,026 --> 00:15:34,427
Can't go back there,
or he'll kill me.

204
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:37,231
Uh, is there anywhere
I can take you,

205
00:15:37,264 --> 00:15:39,166
or anyone
I can drop you off with?

206
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,268
Or wh-what about a neighbor
or a...

207
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:44,437
My dad is at a pool hall
called Fatty's in Baton Rouge.

208
00:15:47,373 --> 00:15:49,876
You know, if you could just,
you know, drop me off there,

209
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:52,045
everything would be cool.

210
00:16:07,627 --> 00:16:11,365
You know, my dad is actually
a professional pool player.

211
00:16:11,397 --> 00:16:13,967
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, big time.

212
00:16:16,169 --> 00:16:17,637
So wh-what's happening?

213
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,572
Is he on a circuit or something?

214
00:16:22,075 --> 00:16:24,510
- Yeah, sort of.
- Hmm.

215
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:29,216
Well, what you do mean
"sort of" or something?

216
00:16:29,249 --> 00:16:31,751
I don't know.
He just, you know, plays around.

217
00:16:31,784 --> 00:16:33,253
Yeah.

218
00:16:33,287 --> 00:16:37,890
Yeah, so basically he just plays
in bars for money, right?

219
00:16:37,924 --> 00:16:40,726
Well, n-not just bars,
you know, tournaments, too.

220
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,397
He's actually making a real
big name for himself.

221
00:16:43,429 --> 00:16:44,998
Yeah, I mean, you know,
people actually compare him

222
00:16:45,032 --> 00:16:47,067
to Willie Mosconi.

223
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,271
Ah, is that right now?
Heh, Willie Mosconi?

224
00:16:51,305 --> 00:16:53,340
You'll see when you meet him.

225
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:13,459
This is your last warning.
Get up.

226
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:18,497
Dallas?

227
00:17:18,531 --> 00:17:20,300
Dallas?

228
00:17:36,149 --> 00:17:37,451
What time is it?

229
00:17:37,483 --> 00:17:39,219
About 7:30.

230
00:17:39,252 --> 00:17:41,687
Come here.
Lie down here.

231
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:43,190
Go lie down.

232
00:17:48,428 --> 00:17:51,064
You know, uh, you should
show me some moves.

233
00:17:51,098 --> 00:17:54,500
- I-I don't think so.
- Why not?

234
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:56,902
I'm-a let you answer
that question.

235
00:17:56,937 --> 00:17:58,138
How far away from Baton Rouge?

236
00:17:58,171 --> 00:18:01,674
It's down the road that way.

237
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:03,977
Okay. Later.

238
00:18:04,011 --> 00:18:07,314
- Hey, wait, hold on!
- That's okay.

239
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:09,249
Wouldn't want to end up
on Amber Alert.

240
00:18:09,282 --> 00:18:12,352
You still might, smart-ass.

241
00:18:13,353 --> 00:18:16,189
Okay, fine.
Suit yourself.

242
00:18:16,223 --> 00:18:18,458
- I will!
- Have a nice walk.

243
00:18:43,383 --> 00:18:45,918
I can't tell you how sorry
I am about your father.

244
00:18:45,952 --> 00:18:48,687
Well, thank you for taking
care of everything, Merle.

245
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:50,290
You bet, Joe.

246
00:18:50,323 --> 00:18:52,025
He'd have done
the same thing for me.

247
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:54,094
Mm.

248
00:18:54,127 --> 00:18:57,696
Now, what are my chances
on talking you

249
00:18:57,730 --> 00:19:00,866
into joining the 21st century
and buying a cellphone?

250
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,069
No, I'm...

251
00:19:02,102 --> 00:19:03,769
I could have called you
a week ago.

252
00:19:03,803 --> 00:19:06,705
Well, I'm just not gonna put a
microwave up against my ears.

253
00:19:06,739 --> 00:19:08,141
It's not gonna happen.

254
00:19:08,175 --> 00:19:10,944
I'd settle for
a mailing address.

255
00:19:10,977 --> 00:19:12,212
Mm.

256
00:19:12,245 --> 00:19:14,381
Well, as executor
of your father's estate,

257
00:19:14,414 --> 00:19:17,217
and I use that term loosely,
I need your signature

258
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,319
on a couple of things
to finalize his will.

259
00:19:19,352 --> 00:19:21,821
His years in assisted living
pretty much took care

260
00:19:21,854 --> 00:19:23,423
of any assets he had left,

261
00:19:23,457 --> 00:19:27,827
but there were a few items
he wanted you to have.

262
00:19:32,499 --> 00:19:35,768
That's 9 grand the IRS
didn't know about.

263
00:19:38,138 --> 00:19:39,738
Well, he never did cease
to amaze me

264
00:19:39,772 --> 00:19:44,077
how he could
turn a nickel into $5.

265
00:19:44,111 --> 00:19:45,946
Gave me his Winchester rifle.

266
00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:49,149
Said it wouldn't fit in the box.

267
00:19:49,182 --> 00:19:51,118
I'll give you a minute.

268
00:20:30,656 --> 00:20:32,159
There is something else, Joe.

269
00:20:32,192 --> 00:20:35,629
The nursing home
forwarded his mail to me.

270
00:20:35,661 --> 00:20:37,230
Didn't know what you wanted me
to do with this.

271
00:20:37,264 --> 00:20:40,666
It's from Christopher.

272
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:43,537
It's addressed to your father,
but I think it's meant for you.

273
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:13,493
So, uh, you're not, like,
on vacation or anything?

274
00:22:14,594 --> 00:22:15,962
You actually live in here?

275
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:20,066
That's right.

276
00:22:26,273 --> 00:22:28,575
Who are they?

277
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,143
Uh, sit back and mind
your own business

278
00:22:30,176 --> 00:22:32,145
before you make me
have an accident.

279
00:22:32,178 --> 00:22:33,280
Oh, I'm just messing.

280
00:22:34,847 --> 00:22:37,617
I got you.
Well, where are they?

281
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:46,960
Well, what have we here?

282
00:22:55,801 --> 00:22:57,170
We stopping?

283
00:22:57,203 --> 00:22:59,606
Yeah, I got to make a living.

284
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:01,041
Hurry up.
It's hot in here.

285
00:23:01,074 --> 00:23:03,876
Well, it was a lot hotter
on that road, wasn't it?

286
00:23:07,747 --> 00:23:09,149
Could have
walked there faster.

287
00:23:14,587 --> 00:23:17,357
- What seems to be the problem?
- How you doing?

288
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,857
Are you with, uh,
roadside assistance?

289
00:23:18,891 --> 00:23:21,127
Uh, no. No, I'm not.
I just kind of do freelance.

290
00:23:21,161 --> 00:23:24,164
I might be able to get you
on the road a lot sooner.

291
00:23:24,197 --> 00:23:25,465
Okay, good, good.

292
00:23:25,498 --> 00:23:27,033
Well, how much do you,
uh, you cost?

293
00:23:27,067 --> 00:23:30,970
Well, I can guarantee you
I charge a lot less than...

294
00:23:31,004 --> 00:23:33,573
Um, we were, like,
a couple miles down,

295
00:23:33,606 --> 00:23:35,408
and it started, uh...

296
00:24:45,979 --> 00:24:47,414
Alright.
Cut the act, slick.

297
00:24:47,447 --> 00:24:49,315
I know you're not sleeping.

298
00:24:49,349 --> 00:24:51,751
I was trying to.

299
00:24:55,422 --> 00:24:58,892
Is everything in there?

300
00:24:58,924 --> 00:25:00,627
Yeah, you know, of...
of course.

301
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:03,329
I didn't take nothing, you know.
Just dropped my pencil.

302
00:25:03,363 --> 00:25:05,465
Oh, yeah, where's your pencil?

303
00:25:08,935 --> 00:25:10,303
You know what would
make more money?

304
00:25:10,336 --> 00:25:11,838
Yeah, I saw you work
your marks

305
00:25:11,871 --> 00:25:13,139
in the pool hall, remember?

306
00:25:13,173 --> 00:25:15,442
He was trying to get over
on me first.

307
00:25:15,475 --> 00:25:18,077
Oh, and that's all
that matters, right?

308
00:25:18,111 --> 00:25:21,614
- Cal teaches me plenty.
- Yeah, it shows.

309
00:25:36,796 --> 00:25:39,499
Come on.
You're not staying in here.

310
00:26:07,093 --> 00:26:08,828
Hey.

311
00:26:08,862 --> 00:26:10,129
Here.

312
00:26:29,015 --> 00:26:31,184
Stop scribbling
on all my crap.

313
00:27:16,329 --> 00:27:17,965
Why we stopping?

314
00:27:42,255 --> 00:27:43,489
Now, you just stay put.

315
00:27:43,523 --> 00:27:46,159
I don't want you going anywhere.

316
00:27:46,192 --> 00:27:49,128
If the air works.

317
00:27:49,162 --> 00:27:50,830
Why wouldn't it?

318
00:27:54,667 --> 00:27:56,235
Now, don't touch anything.

319
00:27:56,269 --> 00:27:58,571
If you do, I'm gonna break
one of your skinny fingers.

320
00:28:30,236 --> 00:28:32,438
Joe.

321
00:28:32,472 --> 00:28:34,975
What in the name of God
are you doing here?

322
00:28:41,214 --> 00:28:44,651
You've, uh, you've kept the
place looking real nice, Maggie.

323
00:28:44,684 --> 00:28:47,153
- Law says you can't be here.
- I know.

324
00:28:48,755 --> 00:28:50,723
I know, I...

325
00:28:50,757 --> 00:28:54,694
I, uh, you know,
I don't want any trouble.

326
00:28:56,329 --> 00:29:01,534
I just, um, I just wanted
to tell Christopher

327
00:29:01,567 --> 00:29:03,770
that his granddaddy passed away.

328
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,308
I'm sorry about that.
I'll let him know.

329
00:29:09,342 --> 00:29:11,744
And would you give this
to him, please?

330
00:29:13,546 --> 00:29:15,348
Chris isn't here.

331
00:29:15,381 --> 00:29:18,251
- Yes, I know he's moved on!
- Yes.

332
00:29:20,286 --> 00:29:23,123
Who's there, Maggie?

333
00:29:24,557 --> 00:29:27,027
Nobody.
I'll be right in.

334
00:29:29,195 --> 00:29:30,229
Mm.

335
00:29:32,132 --> 00:29:34,600
You just stay away from him.
It's the least you could do.

336
00:29:47,081 --> 00:29:50,216
Why'd the woman snub you
like that?

337
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:53,187
I mean, personally, I...
I think it's kind of whacked.

338
00:29:53,219 --> 00:29:56,957
Why can't you give
your kid a gift?

339
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:00,094
You know the nice thing
about a personal life?

340
00:30:02,395 --> 00:30:07,433
- It's personal.
- Hey, man, I'm on your side.

341
00:30:09,502 --> 00:30:11,237
There are no sides.

342
00:30:13,306 --> 00:30:15,875
Hmm, didn't like your
breakfast, honey?

343
00:30:15,908 --> 00:30:19,746
Well, uh, he's having
some lady problems.

344
00:30:19,779 --> 00:30:22,983
Lost his appetite.

345
00:30:23,016 --> 00:30:24,751
Everything was fine.

346
00:30:24,784 --> 00:30:26,486
Just the check, please.

347
00:30:31,791 --> 00:30:33,227
Hey, uh, you know,

348
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:35,294
I think I figured out
the problem with your kid.

349
00:30:35,328 --> 00:30:37,897
Yeah, well,
I don't remember asking.

350
00:30:37,931 --> 00:30:39,066
Just show up to the wedding
and give him

351
00:30:39,099 --> 00:30:40,733
the money in person.

352
00:30:40,767 --> 00:30:43,736
I mean, she can't stop
you then, right?

353
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:45,505
It's more complicated
than that.

354
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:47,907
Then, stop complicating it.

355
00:30:47,941 --> 00:30:49,342
What day is it?

356
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:51,911
Sunday?

357
00:30:51,945 --> 00:30:54,948
Well, you know
I saw the invitation.

358
00:31:02,355 --> 00:31:05,658
We're still going to Fatty's,
right?

359
00:31:26,312 --> 00:31:28,015
Hell, if he ain't
pissing people off,

360
00:31:28,048 --> 00:31:29,482
he's ripping them off.

361
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:31,784
You know them chains and watches
he sells ain't real?

362
00:31:31,818 --> 00:31:33,287
You know, I'm glad you won't
let him play in here.

363
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:34,955
He's more trouble
than he's worth.

364
00:31:34,988 --> 00:31:36,957
- This place is skanky anyway.
- Okay, enough.

365
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:41,061
Well, the apple don't fall too
far from the tree, does it?

366
00:31:41,094 --> 00:31:42,795
I can't imagine why
your daddy ain't home.

367
00:31:42,829 --> 00:31:43,964
- Fuck you, fat man.
- Okay.

368
00:31:48,668 --> 00:31:50,336
You know, it might be
in your best interest

369
00:31:50,369 --> 00:31:52,139
to keep your mouth shut
once in a while.

370
00:31:52,172 --> 00:31:55,008
You know, Cal's talented,
and that makes people jealous.

371
00:31:55,042 --> 00:31:56,509
Yeah, he may be talented,

372
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:58,245
but the truth of the matter
is that your dad...

373
00:31:58,278 --> 00:31:59,846
What would you know
about my dad?

374
00:31:59,879 --> 00:32:02,149
You live in a camper with a dog.

375
00:32:02,182 --> 00:32:04,251
And what does that make me?

376
00:32:04,284 --> 00:32:07,020
Someone whose own family
don't want him around.

377
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,509
You're Cal McCarthy's kid,
right?

378
00:32:30,543 --> 00:32:31,878
Yeah, yeah.

379
00:32:31,911 --> 00:32:33,446
You were at the house, right?

380
00:32:33,479 --> 00:32:35,115
Uh-huh.

381
00:32:35,148 --> 00:32:38,018
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

382
00:32:38,051 --> 00:32:39,253
Come look for him with us?

383
00:32:39,286 --> 00:32:42,755
Dallas, we should probably
be going.

384
00:32:42,788 --> 00:32:44,690
Hold on, cowboy.

385
00:32:44,724 --> 00:32:46,893
The three of us are talking.

386
00:32:46,927 --> 00:32:48,861
I don't want to go anywhere
with you.

387
00:32:48,895 --> 00:32:53,532
Hey, hear that?
The boy don't want to go.

388
00:32:53,566 --> 00:32:56,435
Maybe you would like to stay and
hang out with us for a spell.

389
00:32:56,469 --> 00:32:59,139
Do you know, your daddy and me,
we go way back.

390
00:32:59,172 --> 00:33:02,042
Yeah, well, that's all well
and good, but, uh,

391
00:33:02,075 --> 00:33:03,977
the boy is in my charge,
so if you don't mind.

392
00:33:04,011 --> 00:33:05,745
Oh, we mind.

393
00:33:05,778 --> 00:33:08,781
Might be best if you hop back
in your time machine

394
00:33:08,814 --> 00:33:11,218
and made yourself scarce.

395
00:33:11,251 --> 00:33:12,551
That's just not
gonna happen.

396
00:33:12,585 --> 00:33:14,054
That's not a request.

397
00:33:14,087 --> 00:33:15,322
You know what?
I... I changed my mind.

398
00:33:15,355 --> 00:33:16,990
- I'm... I'm gonna go.
- No, kid.

399
00:33:17,024 --> 00:33:18,225
You want my advice?

400
00:33:18,258 --> 00:33:19,592
Save yourself
a little bit of pain

401
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:21,460
and suffering and walk away.

402
00:33:23,796 --> 00:33:25,498
Alright, old man.

403
00:33:28,969 --> 00:33:31,939
Dallas, you get
in the RV right now.

404
00:33:31,972 --> 00:33:33,941
Come on.

405
00:33:35,775 --> 00:33:38,477
Aah! God.

406
00:33:53,026 --> 00:33:55,963
It's a good thing
you aren't gonna live

407
00:33:55,996 --> 00:33:58,198
long enough to reproduce.

408
00:34:00,466 --> 00:34:02,035
Oh, what?
A cat's got your tongue now?

409
00:34:02,069 --> 00:34:03,602
Okay, that was stupid.

410
00:34:03,636 --> 00:34:05,538
No, that was 85 miles
past stupid.

411
00:34:05,571 --> 00:34:08,241
Yeah, I'm sorry. Okay?
Can you just get off my back?

412
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,945
I got a better idea.

413
00:34:11,979 --> 00:34:13,447
I'm gonna get you
off my back.

414
00:34:14,747 --> 00:34:16,149
Stay, girl!

415
00:34:16,183 --> 00:34:18,718
- Where we going?
- We're not going anywhere.

416
00:34:18,751 --> 00:34:20,120
You're going home.

417
00:34:20,153 --> 00:34:21,955
You're gonna call someone
to come get you.

418
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:25,292
- I already told you.
- I don't care.

419
00:34:25,325 --> 00:34:27,693
- Call anyone.
- What?

420
00:34:27,727 --> 00:34:29,628
I'm not your fricking problem,
okay?

421
00:34:29,662 --> 00:34:33,166
Just leave me alone.
You don't understand.

422
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,700
I know where he's headed.

423
00:34:34,734 --> 00:34:36,736
Look, listen, there's a poster
back at Fatty's, okay?

424
00:34:36,769 --> 00:34:38,838
There's a big pool tournament
this weekend in New Orleans,

425
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:40,073
and he's gonna be there.

426
00:34:40,107 --> 00:34:42,409
That couldn't matter
less to me.

427
00:34:42,442 --> 00:34:44,311
Either you start dialing
or I'm gonna call a cop.

428
00:34:44,344 --> 00:34:46,146
This is your choice.

429
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:48,914
You know what? Fine.
Go ahead.

430
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:52,085
Then I'll never see him again.

431
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:53,719
I fricking lied, okay?

432
00:34:53,753 --> 00:34:55,489
He's not coming back for me.

433
00:35:10,937 --> 00:35:12,605
You coming?!

434
00:35:38,564 --> 00:35:41,034
I screwed up
on the hands a bit.

435
00:35:41,068 --> 00:35:42,635
Well, that's not half bad.

436
00:35:42,668 --> 00:35:46,039
I think you ought to do
something with that.

437
00:35:46,073 --> 00:35:48,574
- With what?
- That.

438
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:51,044
You mean like a job
or something?

439
00:35:51,078 --> 00:35:52,979
Yeah, like a job or something.

440
00:35:53,013 --> 00:35:54,214
Who's gonna pay me
to do this?

441
00:35:54,247 --> 00:35:57,883
A lot of people.

442
00:35:57,917 --> 00:36:02,222
Kind of just figured
I would play pool.

443
00:36:02,255 --> 00:36:04,723
Yeah, well, I'm sure Cal
will be proud of you

444
00:36:04,757 --> 00:36:06,193
no matter what you do.

445
00:36:10,497 --> 00:36:13,100
Alright.
Come on, Story, go get it.

446
00:36:13,133 --> 00:36:14,767
Bring it here.

447
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:38,125
You're the first person she's
let throw a ball besides me.

448
00:36:38,158 --> 00:36:40,759
Really?

449
00:36:40,793 --> 00:36:43,796
Yeah, she must have guessed
you had a good arm.

450
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:45,599
My dad taught me.

451
00:36:45,631 --> 00:36:47,100
He was a pitcher in high school.

452
00:36:47,134 --> 00:36:49,668
Is that right?

453
00:36:49,702 --> 00:36:53,373
You know, um,
I actually played for a bit.

454
00:36:53,406 --> 00:36:55,942
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

455
00:36:55,976 --> 00:36:58,677
You know, my mom worked a lot
and my dad couldn't always

456
00:36:58,711 --> 00:37:01,281
get me to practice,
so had to quit.

457
00:37:01,314 --> 00:37:02,815
Had to quit.

458
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:05,318
Well, we couldn't get enough
of baseball in our house.

459
00:37:05,352 --> 00:37:08,721
Yeah, we... we ate it.
We drank it.

460
00:37:08,754 --> 00:37:11,790
We slept with it.

461
00:37:11,824 --> 00:37:14,294
Whenever there was a game on,
we'd go out on the porch

462
00:37:14,327 --> 00:37:16,896
and listen to the play-by-play
on the radio,

463
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:22,302
ask each other about players'
stats, you know, and all.

464
00:37:22,335 --> 00:37:24,638
We could not stump my youngest.

465
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,273
What's his name?

466
00:37:34,014 --> 00:37:36,483
You got any favorite memories?

467
00:37:36,516 --> 00:37:40,686
I mean, I don't know.
I got lots of them.

468
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:43,256
Any one of them
stick out in your mind?

469
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:53,500
Well, this one time when I was
about 7 or something,

470
00:37:53,533 --> 00:37:55,235
I remember my dad bought

471
00:37:55,268 --> 00:37:57,170
this really bitching
Triumph motorcycle,

472
00:37:57,204 --> 00:37:59,606
and we took a ride
out to the country,

473
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:01,942
to one of his buddies' houses.

474
00:38:01,975 --> 00:38:04,843
You know, a whole bunch of guys
hanging out.

475
00:38:04,877 --> 00:38:06,745
They didn't mind me.

476
00:38:06,779 --> 00:38:09,616
They even let me play
a few hands of cards with them.

477
00:38:09,649 --> 00:38:13,186
I remember when it came time
to leave,

478
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,554
my dad sat me in front of him

479
00:38:14,588 --> 00:38:18,225
and wrapped me up
in his big old leather jacket.

480
00:38:19,926 --> 00:38:22,262
I still remember
what it smelled like.

481
00:38:26,266 --> 00:38:28,368
Pretty stupid, huh?

482
00:38:28,401 --> 00:38:32,973
No, no. That's...
that's not stupid at all.

483
00:38:33,006 --> 00:38:36,142
You know, my dad's not
a bad person.

484
00:38:36,176 --> 00:38:38,211
Yeah, well,
I'm not here to judge.

485
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:23,189
Ugh.

486
00:39:37,003 --> 00:39:38,837
Do you know you have
a taillight out?

487
00:39:38,871 --> 00:39:40,940
Uh, yes, I do.
I do apologize.

488
00:39:40,974 --> 00:39:43,543
License, registration,
proof of insurance.

489
00:39:51,651 --> 00:39:54,887
Okay, Houdini,
you can come out now.

490
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,991
This might be the time
for you to come clean.

491
00:40:00,026 --> 00:40:01,194
Not really.

492
00:40:01,227 --> 00:40:02,629
Well, let me rephrase
that then.

493
00:40:02,662 --> 00:40:05,365
This is the time that you are
gonna come clean.

494
00:40:05,398 --> 00:40:06,832
Okay, fine, I'll tell you
when she leaves.

495
00:40:06,865 --> 00:40:08,234
No, you're gonna
tell me now

496
00:40:08,268 --> 00:40:09,369
or you're gonna be
leaving with her.

497
00:40:09,402 --> 00:40:11,004
Okay, okay.
Fine, fine.

498
00:40:14,274 --> 00:40:16,810
This cop might be
looking for me.

499
00:40:16,842 --> 00:40:19,079
For any particular reason?

500
00:40:19,112 --> 00:40:21,147
Because my mom has probably
got half of Louisiana

501
00:40:21,181 --> 00:40:22,582
out hunting for me by now.

502
00:40:22,615 --> 00:40:26,386
Hmm, and that would be
your dead mom?

503
00:40:28,021 --> 00:40:29,356
You wouldn't have helped me
find him

504
00:40:29,389 --> 00:40:30,824
if I told you the truth.

505
00:40:30,856 --> 00:40:33,760
She know where you are
and what you are doing?

506
00:40:36,763 --> 00:40:39,566
No.

507
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,501
So you gonna turn me in?

508
00:40:41,534 --> 00:40:43,236
I don't know yet.

509
00:40:43,269 --> 00:40:45,038
The day's not over.

510
00:40:46,973 --> 00:40:49,875
I know there's one thing
you're gonna do for me.

511
00:40:57,384 --> 00:40:59,386
- Hello?
- Mom?

512
00:40:59,419 --> 00:41:01,588
Dallas.
What are you doing, baby?

513
00:41:01,621 --> 00:41:02,921
Are you okay?

514
00:41:02,956 --> 00:41:04,858
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.
I'm with a friend.

515
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:06,359
What friend?

516
00:41:06,393 --> 00:41:09,396
Doesn't matter.
He's taking me to Dad.

517
00:41:09,429 --> 00:41:11,698
No, no.
Tell me where you are.

518
00:41:11,731 --> 00:41:13,800
- I'll come get you.
- Not yet.

519
00:41:13,833 --> 00:41:15,702
- Mom, I'm gonna bring him back.
- What?

520
00:41:15,735 --> 00:41:18,505
- I'm gonna bring Dad home.
- What?

521
00:41:21,141 --> 00:41:23,209
Dally, honey,

522
00:41:23,243 --> 00:41:26,079
this ain't got nothing
to do with you, okay?

523
00:41:28,581 --> 00:41:29,949
I'll be home in a day or two.

524
00:41:29,983 --> 00:41:31,418
A day...

525
00:41:31,451 --> 00:41:34,053
Don't do this to me.

526
00:41:34,087 --> 00:41:37,290
Dallas, please, don't.

527
00:41:37,323 --> 00:41:40,293
- Dallas.
- I... I got to go.

528
00:41:40,326 --> 00:41:42,095
Dallas.

529
00:41:48,435 --> 00:41:51,438
You feel better now?

530
00:41:51,471 --> 00:41:52,939
It's overrated.

531
00:42:06,786 --> 00:42:09,289
What are these for?

532
00:42:09,322 --> 00:42:11,357
You earned those.

533
00:42:11,391 --> 00:42:12,792
You did right by your mama.

534
00:42:12,826 --> 00:42:14,661
Besides, you don't want to smell
like old cheese

535
00:42:14,694 --> 00:42:16,329
when you meet with your father.

536
00:42:31,344 --> 00:42:33,046
Oh, Ricky.
Did you hear that?

537
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:37,116
I think that is the sound of you
going to the poor house.

538
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:39,519
I bet you're gonna go there
before I do.

539
00:42:40,987 --> 00:42:43,156
Oh, shit.
That's alright.

540
00:42:43,189 --> 00:42:44,724
I'm gonna be over here
with my little private

541
00:42:44,757 --> 00:42:48,161
cheering section while you clear
the table for me.

542
00:42:49,329 --> 00:42:50,830
Hey, Dad.

543
00:42:52,398 --> 00:42:54,734
Miss me?

544
00:42:54,767 --> 00:42:57,737
Dallas, what are you
doing here?

545
00:42:57,770 --> 00:42:59,873
Came to find you.

546
00:42:59,906 --> 00:43:02,642
Uh, is your mama here?

547
00:43:02,675 --> 00:43:06,546
No, and good thing she ain't.

548
00:43:06,579 --> 00:43:08,983
She the reason you left?

549
00:43:09,015 --> 00:43:10,383
No, hell, no.

550
00:43:10,416 --> 00:43:12,719
I'm not an idiot.

551
00:43:12,752 --> 00:43:15,054
No, no, some fellow is
bothering her, so, you know,

552
00:43:15,088 --> 00:43:17,257
I was just pretending
to be her boyfriend is all.

553
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:19,759
Don't bust my balls.

554
00:43:19,792 --> 00:43:22,362
That's all it was?

555
00:43:22,395 --> 00:43:24,130
'Course that's all it was.

556
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:28,535
Then why did you leave?

557
00:43:28,568 --> 00:43:30,570
Well, Dallas, you know, it...

558
00:43:33,706 --> 00:43:36,576
Hey, how did you
get here anyway?

559
00:43:39,879 --> 00:43:42,950
My friend Joe Haley
gave me a ride.

560
00:43:48,621 --> 00:43:50,557
That so?

561
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,596
Joe Haley.

562
00:43:56,629 --> 00:43:58,097
Hey, Dallas, why don't you,

563
00:43:58,131 --> 00:44:00,533
uh, why don't you go get us
a couple of drinks?

564
00:44:00,567 --> 00:44:02,802
Okay.
Want anything?

565
00:44:02,835 --> 00:44:04,737
Nope, no, thanks.

566
00:44:06,573 --> 00:44:09,242
I suppose you know what's
going through my head right now,

567
00:44:09,275 --> 00:44:12,412
so why don't you tell me
how a grown man knows

568
00:44:12,445 --> 00:44:15,715
my 14-year-old boy?

569
00:44:15,748 --> 00:44:17,216
He was on the side
of the road.

570
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:21,554
His bike had broke down,
and I just offered him a ride.

571
00:44:21,588 --> 00:44:23,556
He said he was looking
for his dad.

572
00:44:26,759 --> 00:44:30,030
Well, you found me.

573
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,568
Where you from?

574
00:44:35,602 --> 00:44:38,571
Uh, mostly here.
Yourself?

575
00:44:38,605 --> 00:44:40,506
Here and there, I guess.

576
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:42,475
Mm. You guess, yeah.

577
00:44:42,508 --> 00:44:45,079
What do you mean by that?

578
00:44:45,111 --> 00:44:47,146
Uh, nothing.

579
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:49,215
No, really, not...
nothing at all.

580
00:44:52,785 --> 00:44:55,521
You know, Joe, uh,

581
00:44:55,555 --> 00:44:59,994
there ain't no road map
to being a daddy, you know?

582
00:45:00,027 --> 00:45:03,296
We just do the best we can.

583
00:45:03,329 --> 00:45:06,100
Yeah, you got that right.

584
00:45:06,132 --> 00:45:07,667
Thank you, boy.

585
00:45:11,972 --> 00:45:14,607
Well, it was nice
talking to you.

586
00:45:14,641 --> 00:45:16,944
- Yeah.
- Um, I-I'm gonna go.

587
00:45:16,977 --> 00:45:18,177
Come on, Joe. Come on.

588
00:45:18,211 --> 00:45:19,545
You don't want to hang
for a little?

589
00:45:19,579 --> 00:45:22,181
No.

590
00:45:22,215 --> 00:45:24,217
Hey, Joe.

591
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:25,986
I just...

592
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:27,654
I wanted to say thank you.

593
00:45:27,687 --> 00:45:30,189
Uh, you bet.

594
00:45:30,223 --> 00:45:35,062
I'll put your backpack and
your bike in your daddy's truck.

595
00:45:38,665 --> 00:45:40,867
Okay.

596
00:45:42,368 --> 00:45:45,672
Oh, hey, and Joe,
don't worry about the wedding.

597
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:55,648
Your buddy is leaving, huh?

598
00:45:55,682 --> 00:45:57,483
Yeah.

599
00:45:57,517 --> 00:45:59,218
I'm sorry about that.

600
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:04,490
How about we do what we do

601
00:46:04,524 --> 00:46:06,826
and get down
to some serious matters, okay?

602
00:46:06,859 --> 00:46:09,729
We've got some fish to fry.

603
00:46:09,762 --> 00:46:11,497
Alright, folks.

604
00:46:11,531 --> 00:46:16,502
I've got 50 bucks says this boy
can beat anybody in this room.

605
00:46:40,393 --> 00:46:43,362
$20, $40, $60, $80, $81.

606
00:46:43,396 --> 00:46:45,264
Easy money, huh?

607
00:46:45,298 --> 00:46:49,136
That sure as hell beats 9-5,
barely alive.

608
00:46:52,605 --> 00:46:54,074
Why do you do it?

609
00:46:57,677 --> 00:46:59,412
Why do I do it?

610
00:47:01,414 --> 00:47:04,917
It's in my blood, just like
it was in your grandpa Gus'

611
00:47:04,952 --> 00:47:07,920
and just like it's in yours.

612
00:47:17,864 --> 00:47:19,866
You're making me
lose count here.

613
00:47:25,671 --> 00:47:27,673
Alright.

614
00:47:27,707 --> 00:47:29,442
Why you so moody?

615
00:47:31,677 --> 00:47:34,081
Look, you just made
some money.

616
00:47:34,114 --> 00:47:35,648
Can we just go home now?

617
00:47:35,681 --> 00:47:37,850
Dallas, tournament
is tomorrow.

618
00:47:37,884 --> 00:47:40,988
I didn't come all this way
not to play.

619
00:47:41,021 --> 00:47:43,823
Fine, after the tournament.

620
00:47:43,856 --> 00:47:45,092
We'll talk about it later.

621
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:46,826
No, why can't we
talk about it now?

622
00:47:46,859 --> 00:47:48,795
Stop riding me, boy.

623
00:47:55,301 --> 00:47:56,970
Okay.

624
00:47:58,471 --> 00:48:01,108
Why don't you take this,
go get us a couple of sodas?

625
00:48:01,141 --> 00:48:02,341
I'm gonna take a shower.

626
00:48:02,375 --> 00:48:04,644
Afterwards, we'll go
grab a burger.

627
00:48:04,677 --> 00:48:06,379
Does that sound alright?

628
00:48:16,223 --> 00:48:17,690
Dallas.

629
00:48:17,723 --> 00:48:19,826
You okay?

630
00:48:19,859 --> 00:48:21,061
It's okay.
It's alright.

631
00:48:21,094 --> 00:48:23,030
I know these guys.

632
00:48:23,063 --> 00:48:26,566
Cal, why did you make us
chase you

633
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:29,502
halfway across the state?

634
00:48:29,535 --> 00:48:32,805
It's $1,000.

635
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:35,508
$1,000. Take it.

636
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:36,843
You're five short,
son of a bitch.

637
00:48:36,876 --> 00:48:39,645
No!
Please don't hurt him.

638
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,380
Don't do it.
Dad.

639
00:48:41,414 --> 00:48:44,650
What are you doing?
No, wait, please.

640
00:48:44,684 --> 00:48:47,753
How am I supposed to pay
you back if I can't play?

641
00:48:47,787 --> 00:48:49,189
No, wait, please.

642
00:48:49,223 --> 00:48:50,958
I... I... I know where
we can get the money.

643
00:48:53,559 --> 00:48:57,197
Dad, just promise me
you'll come home?

644
00:49:01,901 --> 00:49:03,836
Okay.

645
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:19,852
There's a dog.

646
00:49:19,886 --> 00:49:21,621
Just get the box.
I'll distract it.

647
00:49:21,654 --> 00:49:24,124
Just get the box.
Go.

648
00:49:24,157 --> 00:49:26,692
Hey.

649
00:49:26,726 --> 00:49:27,860
Hey.

650
00:49:33,833 --> 00:49:36,069
Shh.

651
00:49:39,739 --> 00:49:42,309
- Get out of here!
- Oh!

652
00:49:51,318 --> 00:49:53,452
Ah!

653
00:50:05,831 --> 00:50:07,600
Get the money.

654
00:50:43,803 --> 00:50:47,441
Hey, kiddo.

655
00:50:47,473 --> 00:50:49,176
Are you okay?

656
00:50:51,311 --> 00:50:53,947
I just want to go home.

657
00:50:53,981 --> 00:50:55,681
Yeah.

658
00:51:01,221 --> 00:51:03,223
I'm sorry about your friend.

659
00:51:03,256 --> 00:51:06,226
You know, to be honest with you,

660
00:51:06,259 --> 00:51:09,262
I sometimes forget
you're just 14.

661
00:51:12,698 --> 00:51:15,969
I know you want to go home,
and I don't want you to worry,

662
00:51:16,003 --> 00:51:19,705
so first thing in the morning,
we're gonna put you on a bus.

663
00:51:19,739 --> 00:51:22,009
Okay?

664
00:51:22,042 --> 00:51:24,177
But you said you were
coming with me.

665
00:51:28,048 --> 00:51:30,716
I'm not, Dallas.

666
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:32,452
You promised.

667
00:51:35,455 --> 00:51:36,689
I know.

668
00:51:38,291 --> 00:51:41,395
I know I did.

669
00:51:44,131 --> 00:51:46,832
Listen...

670
00:51:46,866 --> 00:51:48,335
I am not good...

671
00:51:48,368 --> 00:51:51,904
As a matter of fact, I am
horrible at playing pretend,

672
00:51:51,938 --> 00:51:54,941
and I've been doing it too long,

673
00:51:54,975 --> 00:51:56,209
and it's not fair to your mama,

674
00:51:56,243 --> 00:51:58,711
and it's certainly
not fair to you.

675
00:52:01,948 --> 00:52:05,885
The fact of the matter is I...
I can't do it anymore.

676
00:52:05,918 --> 00:52:07,454
But...

677
00:52:07,487 --> 00:52:11,391
Just hear me out, please.

678
00:52:13,393 --> 00:52:16,629
See, me, I am who I am.

679
00:52:18,398 --> 00:52:20,033
And I'm gonna have to live
with that forever,

680
00:52:20,067 --> 00:52:23,602
but that does not mean that I
have to put you through it, too.

681
00:52:26,306 --> 00:52:28,475
I mean, look at us, Dallas.

682
00:52:28,508 --> 00:52:29,809
I'm supposed to be your daddy,

683
00:52:29,842 --> 00:52:34,613
and you're the one
that's taking care of me.

684
00:52:37,683 --> 00:52:42,222
Look, the best thing I can do
for everyone

685
00:52:42,255 --> 00:52:45,358
is to not go back.

686
00:52:47,827 --> 00:52:49,062
But mom needs you.

687
00:52:49,096 --> 00:52:51,498
No.

688
00:52:51,531 --> 00:52:54,234
No, your mama doesn't need me.

689
00:52:54,267 --> 00:52:56,436
The only one mama needs is you.

690
00:52:59,473 --> 00:53:01,441
You lie.

691
00:53:01,475 --> 00:53:04,945
- You lie about everything.
- Yeah.

692
00:53:04,978 --> 00:53:07,447
Yeah, I know.

693
00:53:07,481 --> 00:53:11,251
The thing is, though, I'm not
lying about this,

694
00:53:11,284 --> 00:53:14,020
and some day you're going
to realize very soon

695
00:53:14,054 --> 00:53:17,991
that I was really never there.

696
00:54:48,448 --> 00:54:50,584
- Get out of here, kid.
- Joe, I...

697
00:54:50,617 --> 00:54:52,552
- You're a little prick.
- I...

698
00:54:55,555 --> 00:54:58,491
What, what, what?
You're sorry, right?

699
00:55:00,893 --> 00:55:03,296
I didn't have a choice.

700
00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:05,798
You always have a choice.

701
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,735
They were gonna cut off
my dad's finger.

702
00:55:11,504 --> 00:55:15,874
Well, none of that matters
anymore.

703
00:55:15,908 --> 00:55:20,113
Joe, wh-what can I do?
I'll do anything.

704
00:55:20,146 --> 00:55:22,148
You can leave.

705
00:55:35,695 --> 00:55:37,097
Come on, girl.
You got to eat.

706
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:39,266
Come on, Story.

707
00:56:45,932 --> 00:56:47,067
Can I help you?

708
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:48,535
I want to sign up.

709
00:56:51,904 --> 00:56:53,406
Dallas?

710
00:57:00,113 --> 00:57:03,416
I'm not here for you.

711
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:06,686
I'm here to beat you.

712
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,254
Ladies and gentlemen,

713
00:57:08,288 --> 00:57:12,525
welcome to the one and only
Lacy's Cue 9-Ball Open.

714
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,162
Alright.
Let's hear it.

715
00:57:16,196 --> 00:57:17,997
Let's get this party started.

716
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,770
Somebody should have
warned me.

717
00:58:39,312 --> 00:58:42,515
Tell you what,
you're impressing me today.

718
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:46,085
I did notice you were
a little tight on the breaks,

719
00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:49,456
maybe just loosen up
that backstroke a little bit.

720
00:58:55,495 --> 00:58:57,363
Or just do it your own way.

721
00:59:15,715 --> 00:59:18,852
Dallas McCarthy.

722
00:59:18,885 --> 00:59:22,322
I tell you, folks, this boy
is only 14 years old.

723
00:59:22,355 --> 00:59:23,958
I don't know for sure,

724
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:26,626
but I think we could be making
some history here tonight.

725
00:59:26,659 --> 00:59:28,795
Let's hear it for all
the players we've had

726
00:59:28,828 --> 00:59:30,063
in this tournament.

727
01:00:43,436 --> 01:00:45,238
You've got to be kidding me.

728
01:00:45,271 --> 01:00:47,740
Is this kid not something,
people?

729
01:00:47,774 --> 01:00:49,275
This is one of
the best tournaments

730
01:00:49,309 --> 01:00:50,577
I think we've ever had.

731
01:00:50,610 --> 01:00:52,545
You all give me
a little space here.

732
01:00:52,579 --> 01:00:53,713
Come over here, boy.

733
01:00:53,746 --> 01:00:57,216
How you feeling?

734
01:00:57,250 --> 01:00:58,986
- Okay.
- Okay?

735
01:00:59,019 --> 01:01:02,288
Son, you're about to be playing
your daddy in the finals

736
01:01:02,322 --> 01:01:05,059
of a winner-take-all
pro-am qualifying tournament

737
01:01:05,091 --> 01:01:09,162
and the best you can tell me
is you feel okay?

738
01:01:09,195 --> 01:01:11,564
Oh, hell, he's just a little
bit nervous is all.

739
01:01:11,598 --> 01:01:15,970
He's never beaten me more than
a game in a row in his whole life.

740
01:01:16,003 --> 01:01:18,905
Oh, let's hear it
for our two finalists.

741
01:01:18,939 --> 01:01:20,673
Now let's shoot some 9-ball.

742
01:01:38,959 --> 01:01:42,295
Make it good, Dally, might be
the only shot you get.

743
01:02:45,425 --> 01:02:47,061
There's your one.

744
01:03:11,651 --> 01:03:13,187
Ball in hand.

745
01:03:13,219 --> 01:03:16,123
That was your first mistake.

746
01:03:56,262 --> 01:03:59,665
May as well start unscrewing
that thing now.

747
01:03:59,699 --> 01:04:00,900
Let's rack them.

748
01:04:09,143 --> 01:04:11,410
I think that makes us even.

749
01:04:11,444 --> 01:04:12,779
You know, I'm gonna be
flat-out honest

750
01:04:12,812 --> 01:04:14,480
with you here, Dallas.

751
01:04:14,514 --> 01:04:18,351
I do believe that your chances
are dwindling.

752
01:04:18,384 --> 01:04:21,354
Oh, talk about keeping it
in the family.

753
01:04:21,387 --> 01:04:23,123
Let's hear it
for these McCarthy boys.

754
01:05:24,117 --> 01:05:26,819
Looks like I may shoot again.

755
01:06:32,418 --> 01:06:34,221
That was beyond impressive,
Dallas.

756
01:06:34,254 --> 01:06:36,589
Hey, Cal, can you
come over here a minute?

757
01:06:39,759 --> 01:06:41,395
Cal, you proud of your boy?

758
01:06:41,427 --> 01:06:43,562
I am always proud of my boy.

759
01:06:43,596 --> 01:06:45,065
Spoken like a real papa.

760
01:06:48,268 --> 01:06:49,902
No, it's... it's all right.

761
01:06:49,937 --> 01:06:52,339
Hell, I deserve it.

762
01:06:54,507 --> 01:06:59,745
Dallas, no matter how much
you hate me,

763
01:06:59,779 --> 01:07:02,682
I am so proud of you.

764
01:07:02,715 --> 01:07:05,851
I will always love you.

765
01:07:05,885 --> 01:07:07,753
You need to know that.

766
01:07:28,342 --> 01:07:30,978
In three seconds,
I'm calling security.

767
01:07:38,684 --> 01:07:40,786
Where did you get that?

768
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:44,490
From the 9-ball tournament.

769
01:07:46,326 --> 01:07:48,462
Just wanted to give it to you.
That's all.

770
01:07:48,494 --> 01:07:49,729
Hold on.

771
01:07:57,404 --> 01:07:59,705
I believe you still owe me
one favor.

772
01:08:43,083 --> 01:08:45,052
Joe?

773
01:08:47,787 --> 01:08:49,089
Joe?

774
01:08:49,122 --> 01:08:50,723
Joe.

775
01:08:52,059 --> 01:08:54,794
Hi.

776
01:08:54,827 --> 01:08:57,064
Just let... let me rest.

777
01:08:58,831 --> 01:09:00,367
Sorry. Just rest.

778
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:02,202
I'll talk to you later.

779
01:09:02,235 --> 01:09:05,172
It's okay.
Just... Just rest.

780
01:10:30,656 --> 01:10:32,325
Damn it!

781
01:10:36,997 --> 01:10:39,865
Give me those damn keys.

782
01:10:39,899 --> 01:10:41,700
Now!

783
01:10:41,734 --> 01:10:43,570
You could have killed
the both of us.

784
01:10:43,603 --> 01:10:46,306
Relax. I drive my dad's truck
all the time.

785
01:10:46,339 --> 01:10:47,641
You had no right.

786
01:10:47,673 --> 01:10:49,309
Figured I was
doing you a favor.

787
01:10:49,342 --> 01:10:52,845
Yeah, well, you figured wrong.
Now give me those damn keys.

788
01:11:15,302 --> 01:11:17,836
Get dressed.

789
01:11:17,870 --> 01:11:19,606
You're gonna be late.

790
01:11:31,151 --> 01:11:32,885
You look good.

791
01:11:36,389 --> 01:11:39,693
Know what you're gonna say?

792
01:11:39,725 --> 01:11:41,760
Don't worry.
It's gonna be great.

793
01:11:49,802 --> 01:11:51,870
Oh, no, no, no.
You're coming, too.

794
01:11:51,904 --> 01:11:53,573
You got me into this.

795
01:11:53,607 --> 01:11:54,541
Come on.

796
01:12:06,419 --> 01:12:08,221
You want to get closer?

797
01:12:08,255 --> 01:12:10,856
No, I'm fine.

798
01:12:13,026 --> 01:12:14,995
Okay. Here you go.

799
01:12:38,618 --> 01:12:40,086
No, I... I got this.

800
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:42,155
Just take care of the guests.

801
01:12:42,188 --> 01:12:44,324
Okay.

802
01:12:53,166 --> 01:12:55,335
- Hey.
- Hey.

803
01:12:55,368 --> 01:12:57,337
What are you doing here, Joe?

804
01:12:57,370 --> 01:13:00,674
I already know about grandpa.

805
01:13:00,707 --> 01:13:04,110
I just wanted to
congratulate you...

806
01:13:04,144 --> 01:13:06,613
in person.

807
01:13:06,646 --> 01:13:08,048
This is a big day.

808
01:13:08,081 --> 01:13:11,551
Yeah, just surprising.

809
01:13:13,053 --> 01:13:15,655
It's been a while, you know?

810
01:13:19,892 --> 01:13:23,862
Chris, you have every right to
be angry about a lot of things.

811
01:13:23,896 --> 01:13:27,334
I just wanted you to know
that I'm a different person now.

812
01:13:27,367 --> 01:13:29,135
Yeah?

813
01:13:29,169 --> 01:13:31,338
You don't look that different.

814
01:13:31,371 --> 01:13:34,207
Still fighting those demons?

815
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:36,009
Some of them.

816
01:13:39,346 --> 01:13:42,148
Um, I want you
to have this money,

817
01:13:42,182 --> 01:13:44,818
just to help you get started.

818
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:46,553
We're fine.

819
01:13:48,521 --> 01:13:50,889
I know it hurts, Chris.

820
01:13:53,193 --> 01:13:54,994
Yes.

821
01:13:55,028 --> 01:13:58,098
Yes, it does.

822
01:13:58,131 --> 01:14:00,934
17 years' worth.

823
01:14:00,967 --> 01:14:03,403
It hurts me, too.

824
01:14:03,436 --> 01:14:05,505
What do you want from me, Joe?

825
01:14:11,444 --> 01:14:14,848
I... I... I just...

826
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,549
Nothing more than to tell you

827
01:14:16,583 --> 01:14:19,918
how sorry I am, okay,
and that I...

828
01:14:19,953 --> 01:14:24,557
hope some day
you could come to forgive me.

829
01:14:24,591 --> 01:14:27,727
I don't know.

830
01:14:30,430 --> 01:14:33,366
You had two sons.

831
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,635
You cared more about
losing Danny

832
01:14:35,668 --> 01:14:37,604
than you did about saving me.

833
01:14:42,075 --> 01:14:44,677
Excuse me, but I'm going
to go do this right.

834
01:14:46,980 --> 01:14:48,148
Mom.

835
01:15:17,544 --> 01:15:19,679
I shouldn't have
brought you here.

836
01:15:19,712 --> 01:15:21,748
It's alright.
Don't worry about it.

837
01:15:21,781 --> 01:15:23,183
What was that about?

838
01:15:28,021 --> 01:15:30,590
I blinked.

839
01:15:30,623 --> 01:15:35,695
I, uh, I took my eyes
off the prize.

840
01:15:38,064 --> 01:15:40,099
After one of Danny's
Little League games,

841
01:15:40,133 --> 01:15:42,535
he and I went out
with some of his teammates

842
01:15:42,569 --> 01:15:46,873
and their parents
for drinks and whatnot.

843
01:15:48,808 --> 01:15:51,144
I think Christopher was...

844
01:15:51,177 --> 01:15:52,812
Well, he had a cold,

845
01:15:52,846 --> 01:15:55,648
and he had stayed home
with his mother that day.

846
01:15:59,252 --> 01:16:02,522
And we were already late.
I don't know why I...

847
01:16:07,894 --> 01:16:11,631
I thought I could
beat the light.

848
01:16:11,664 --> 01:16:15,502
My judgment was impaired.

849
01:16:18,204 --> 01:16:20,840
I didn't realize that
Danny wasn't...

850
01:16:24,511 --> 01:16:26,513
...that Danny wasn't buckled in.

851
01:16:35,188 --> 01:16:37,557
Dallas, there's some things
in your life

852
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:40,226
you just can't run away from.

853
01:16:45,298 --> 01:16:48,401
So, uh, let's get you home.

854
01:17:08,788 --> 01:17:10,423
It's over there.

855
01:17:24,237 --> 01:17:26,573
It's gonna be weird
without my dad around.

856
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:38,718
Dallas, you know,
whether he comes back

857
01:17:38,751 --> 01:17:41,454
or even if he doesn't,

858
01:17:41,487 --> 01:17:44,223
that's something
you can't control,

859
01:17:44,257 --> 01:17:48,595
and you can't let it derail
your own life, you know?

860
01:17:48,628 --> 01:17:51,631
It's... it's time for you
to get on

861
01:17:51,664 --> 01:17:54,500
with your own life
however best you can.

862
01:18:02,342 --> 01:18:05,980
Uh, could I see that drawing
you did of me earlier?

863
01:18:18,291 --> 01:18:20,760
- Sign it.
- Why?

864
01:18:20,793 --> 01:18:22,428
Because I want it.

865
01:18:36,242 --> 01:18:37,978
Okay.

866
01:18:41,081 --> 01:18:42,515
Off you go.

867
01:19:18,052 --> 01:19:19,252
Think God ever makes mistakes

868
01:19:19,285 --> 01:19:22,722
when he assigns children
to their parents?

869
01:19:22,755 --> 01:19:24,691
I don't know.

870
01:19:26,859 --> 01:19:30,329
He should have put us together.

871
01:19:30,363 --> 01:19:32,665
He did, son.

872
01:19:32,699 --> 01:19:34,233
He did.

873
01:28:58,346 --> 01:29:03,346
