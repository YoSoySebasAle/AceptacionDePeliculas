1
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:09,069
You got off easy.

2
00:00:09,649 --> 00:00:10,975
Of course.

3
00:00:12,852 --> 00:00:15,352
Did you ever imagine
how it would be...

4
00:00:15,402 --> 00:00:16,752
What do you want?

5
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:18,878
Just a simple favour.

6
00:00:18,928 --> 00:00:19,928
Money?

7
00:00:21,638 --> 00:00:23,838
Cold.
- Dope doesn't fly anymore.

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,050
I took big risks for you.

9
00:00:30,871 --> 00:00:33,071
What am I to do with this picture?

10
00:00:36,144 --> 00:00:37,544
I like this chick.

11
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:39,629
Is this your stake?

12
00:00:41,836 --> 00:00:43,936
That's probably not my decision.

13
00:00:45,435 --> 00:00:47,385
Think long and hard about it.

14
00:00:47,741 --> 00:00:50,191
I want you to act
as a killer for her.

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,582
All you need is
a gun and imagination.

16
00:00:53,632 --> 00:00:54,880
A bad movie.

17
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:58,009
That's the plan.

18
00:00:58,945 --> 00:01:00,495
And what's the point?

19
00:01:02,322 --> 00:01:03,872
Is it so hard to get?

20
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,679
You look like a killer
but you are no killer.

21
00:01:08,467 --> 00:01:10,867
The gun's empty but
she doesn't know.

22
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:13,509
As soon as she'll realize it...

23
00:01:13,559 --> 00:01:15,960
it will put an end to her fantasizing.

24
00:01:16,212 --> 00:01:18,212
Why don't you leave her alone?

25
00:01:18,548 --> 00:01:20,348
I don't want to lose her.

26
00:02:04,273 --> 00:02:05,897
A FILM BY

27
00:02:15,584 --> 00:02:18,034
Cinema Goetheplatz,
one moment please.

28
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,263
Number 14, Row D for two.

29
00:02:30,527 --> 00:02:32,019
How may I help you?

30
00:02:33,284 --> 00:02:35,184
<i>I'd like to get to know you.</i>

31
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,770
Not necessary. I already know you.

32
00:02:39,207 --> 00:02:40,607
<i>That's impossible.</i>

33
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:43,311
In the theatre everything's possible.

34
00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:48,798
I heard your voice a hundred times.
I know what you look like.

35
00:02:48,848 --> 00:02:51,748
<i>So you'll recognise me later
in the Ramona Bar.</i>

36
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:53,499
We'll see.

37
00:02:56,569 --> 00:02:58,319
Yes?
- Two for Cinema C.

38
00:03:09,882 --> 00:03:11,782
Sold not a single ice cream.

39
00:03:15,893 --> 00:03:18,393
One guy wanted
a 500 Marks bill changed.

40
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,730
No chance!

41
00:03:20,565 --> 00:03:22,265
Why do you get riled up?

42
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:24,215
It's all just a show anyhow.

43
00:03:46,997 --> 00:03:48,297
How many are in?

44
00:03:49,122 --> 00:03:50,272
About eighty.

45
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:53,849
Please come into my office later.

46
00:04:00,706 --> 00:04:02,320
Cinema Goetheplatz.

47
00:04:03,232 --> 00:04:06,432
<i>What kind of movie, is it the one
tomorrow at 10:30 P.M.?</i>

48
00:04:07,262 --> 00:04:08,762
10:30 P.M. tomorrow?

49
00:04:09,152 --> 00:04:11,458
Horror.
- A horror movie.

50
00:04:13,262 --> 00:04:15,418
<i>That's not my cup of tea.</i>

51
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,720
<i>Is there sex in it?</i>

52
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:20,169
Depends on you.

53
00:04:21,355 --> 00:04:23,055
A man gets buried alive.

54
00:04:23,581 --> 00:04:25,049
Ah, that one...

55
00:04:27,545 --> 00:04:29,195
That jerk hung up.

56
00:05:25,295 --> 00:05:26,295
Fuck.

57
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:30,078
I'm happy you're here.

58
00:07:31,074 --> 00:07:32,074
Me too.

59
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:36,619
Would be nice if
you'd be here more often.

60
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:40,978
A rare occasion.

61
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,240
Know what we'll do?

62
00:07:50,685 --> 00:07:53,869
We go to Acapulco
to break the bank.

63
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,609
And with the money we open up a bar.

64
00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:00,359
And then you can invite all
the celebrities

65
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:02,919
you're searching for
on your nightly trips.

66
00:08:02,969 --> 00:08:05,269
And in the bathroom you will meet...

67
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,872
Marilyn Monroe.

68
00:08:06,922 --> 00:08:08,460
Ha ha, very funny.

69
00:08:10,846 --> 00:08:13,899
Not Marilyn Monroe
but rather Porky Pig.

70
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,920
Better.

71
00:08:23,392 --> 00:08:25,842
By the way,
it's nice and warm in bed.

72
00:08:40,663 --> 00:08:43,801
Troubles?
- Not more than usual.

73
00:08:50,286 --> 00:08:52,036
Wanna go out for a drink?

74
00:08:55,455 --> 00:08:56,755
I've got to run.

75
00:09:21,462 --> 00:09:24,262
Too bad there's no part
for me in your movie.

76
00:10:16,424 --> 00:10:19,151
No can do.
I have something planned for later.

77
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,682
Life or business?

78
00:10:21,942 --> 00:10:23,342
What do you think?

79
00:10:48,081 --> 00:10:49,781
I've seen a wedding once

80
00:10:49,831 --> 00:10:52,631
where the bride was in love
with another man.

81
00:10:53,012 --> 00:10:54,562
At the last second...

82
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,320
Shortly before she said 'Yes'...

83
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:00,020
he ran into the church
and yelled her name

84
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,720
till they both ran off.

85
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,350
Before that, he locked the
wedding guests into the church.

86
00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:39,221
I've seen enough.

87
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:02,485
And the whole class
is yelling 'Yes Miss!'.

88
00:12:03,212 --> 00:12:06,812
<i>Sit down, we need to talk.
- I thought we'd go to the movies.</i>

89
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,840
<i>Please, no back-talking.</i>

90
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:12,700
<i>Very well.</i>

91
00:12:39,986 --> 00:12:42,936
I once knew someone
who only could live by night

92
00:12:42,986 --> 00:12:45,086
although he wasn't really alive.

93
00:12:45,136 --> 00:12:48,186
He prowled the night
and drank the blood of humans

94
00:12:48,236 --> 00:12:50,373
until they became like him.

95
00:12:50,543 --> 00:12:56,706
At cockcrow he had to be at his home
because sunlight made him wither.

96
00:13:02,873 --> 00:13:04,173
Or did he melt?

97
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:08,301
He turned to ash.

98
00:13:10,587 --> 00:13:11,887
And I'm leaving.

99
00:13:14,182 --> 00:13:15,982
What if we leave together?

100
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:18,955
Why now all of a sudden?

101
00:13:20,237 --> 00:13:22,037
I'm taking a shower first.

102
00:13:24,308 --> 00:13:26,408
What movie did you watch?

103
00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:28,049
What do you mean?

104
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,222
Did you meet someone?
- No, or else I wouldn't have come.

105
00:13:39,448 --> 00:13:41,830
Really? No one at all?

106
00:13:46,406 --> 00:13:48,756
Don't ask these kind of questions.

107
00:14:25,313 --> 00:14:26,813
You're still in bed?

108
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:54,591
What are you waiting for?

109
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,349
I don't know.

110
00:15:36,592 --> 00:15:37,742
Let me drive.

111
00:17:13,422 --> 00:17:15,072
We need to fill up gas.

112
00:18:08,764 --> 00:18:11,837
Hello.
- Evenin'. Fill her up, please.

113
00:20:51,555 --> 00:20:52,755
This is Annie.

114
00:20:52,805 --> 00:20:55,005
Hi Annie. I'm Johnny. Have a seat.

115
00:20:56,981 --> 00:21:01,015
I have to make a call.
The drinks are on me.

116
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:14,511
Do I have a reason?

117
00:21:27,603 --> 00:21:29,303
Cheers Annie.
- Cheers.

118
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:14,172
I'm going home.

119
00:23:29,546 --> 00:23:32,696
Cinema Goetheplatz.
<i>- Has the movie already started?</i>

120
00:23:32,882 --> 00:23:34,682
It started 20 minutes ago.

121
00:23:35,762 --> 00:23:38,722
<i>Too bad. Thanks.</i>
- You're welcome.

122
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,540
What's up?
<i>- It's the seducing projectionist.</i>

123
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:06,419
Get B.B. on the phone, please.

124
00:24:11,144 --> 00:24:13,058
You're wanted on the phone.

125
00:24:13,108 --> 00:24:15,008
Who is it?
- Three guesses.

126
00:24:15,748 --> 00:24:18,249
Him? What does he want?

127
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:31,055
Bockmann speaking.
<i>- Darling, how are you doing?</i>

128
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,510
Unchanged since your last 97 calls.

129
00:24:36,371 --> 00:24:37,940
<i>Kiss my ass.</i>

130
00:24:40,947 --> 00:24:43,447
I won't be forming habits
because of you.

131
00:24:45,921 --> 00:24:48,732
<i>Jesus, who are you waiting for?</i>

132
00:24:50,211 --> 00:24:51,338
<i>For Otto?</i>

133
00:24:54,643 --> 00:24:57,370
Definitely not for
a Frankenstein like you.

134
00:24:57,818 --> 00:25:00,227
Have fun in your darkroom.

135
00:25:04,056 --> 00:25:06,260
<i>Do you have to break my heart?</i>

136
00:25:07,663 --> 00:25:09,624
Rather yours than mine.

137
00:25:13,462 --> 00:25:15,386
Any more questions?

138
00:25:16,457 --> 00:25:18,857
Hello? Who is this?

139
00:25:19,692 --> 00:25:21,592
Cinema Goetheplatz.

140
00:25:21,775 --> 00:25:24,605
Hello? Who is this?

141
00:25:28,632 --> 00:25:31,453
Maybe it was the guy
I met yesterday.

142
00:25:33,488 --> 00:25:36,238
But how would he know
I'm working here?

143
00:25:36,288 --> 00:25:39,134
He was a freak, let me tell you.

144
00:25:39,709 --> 00:25:41,876
First we went to a bar.

145
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:45,639
Champagne... He paid for it all.

146
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:50,426
Then he wanted to go to a hotel.
A hotel room!

147
00:25:51,061 --> 00:25:54,105
Can you imagine?
I'm no hooker!

148
00:25:54,939 --> 00:25:57,789
I asked him why he
won't take me to his place.

149
00:25:58,955 --> 00:26:03,026
He said he can't go home.
His wife has a lover.

150
00:26:03,472 --> 00:26:05,897
And in the meantime he
has to take a hike.

151
00:26:05,947 --> 00:26:08,865
That's what I'm good for.
Forget it!

152
00:26:09,556 --> 00:26:12,264
I asked why he isn't
getting a divorce.

153
00:26:13,274 --> 00:26:14,974
Wanna know what he said?

154
00:26:15,712 --> 00:26:17,712
He still has the hots for her.

155
00:26:18,835 --> 00:26:20,815
You can count me out.

156
00:26:21,394 --> 00:26:23,813
Then he tried to kiss me.

157
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,780
He started to grope me.

158
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,811
Nutcase! He only bit my neck,
he couldn't get any further.

159
00:26:32,371 --> 00:26:35,621
There's something wrong
with a guy like that.

160
00:26:37,918 --> 00:26:41,668
Did you ever have an experience
that feels just not quite right.

161
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:46,980
You meet someone and some detail
just does not fit.

162
00:26:48,757 --> 00:26:50,107
What do you mean?

163
00:26:51,764 --> 00:26:53,258
I'm not here!

164
00:26:54,528 --> 00:26:57,292
<i>Tell Miss Bockmann
to come to my office.</i>

165
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:00,478
Not him again!

166
00:28:55,479 --> 00:28:57,179
<i>...talk to the American.</i>

167
00:28:58,691 --> 00:29:00,223
<i>Maybe I'm coming.</i>

168
00:29:04,585 --> 00:29:08,087
<i>See my feet in the mirror?
- Yes</i>

169
00:29:10,848 --> 00:29:14,061
<i>Think they're pretty?
- Yes. Very.</i>

170
00:29:16,364 --> 00:29:20,706
<i>And my ankles? Do you like them?
- Yes.</i>

171
00:29:23,834 --> 00:29:25,179
<i>My knees?</i>

172
00:29:29,022 --> 00:29:30,619
<i>I love your knees.</i>

173
00:29:33,756 --> 00:29:34,956
<i>And my thighs?</i>

174
00:29:37,632 --> 00:29:38,818
<i>Them, too.</i>

175
00:31:00,007 --> 00:31:03,598
<i>...the guy is screwing you.
Every mornin', every evenin'!</i>

176
00:31:03,648 --> 00:31:06,105
<i>As soon as I leave the door!</i>

177
00:32:08,216 --> 00:32:10,607
Have you rented the whole floor?

178
00:32:13,727 --> 00:32:15,227
You gave me a scare.

179
00:32:16,005 --> 00:32:17,955
I thought you'd come earlier.

180
00:32:23,722 --> 00:32:26,472
Go right in.
I have to straighten out something.

181
00:32:26,522 --> 00:32:27,522
Later!

182
00:32:57,225 --> 00:33:00,625
Where are those beautiful legs
walking at this late hour?

183
00:33:00,675 --> 00:33:02,875
Alone to bed if all goes smoothly.

184
00:33:23,647 --> 00:33:25,197
Do you want anything?

185
00:33:25,786 --> 00:33:27,836
Was Richard here?
- Richard...

186
00:33:28,709 --> 00:33:29,923
He wasn't.

187
00:33:31,528 --> 00:33:34,228
What about Maserati?
- He left a while ago.

188
00:33:41,914 --> 00:33:43,964
The next one's paying.

189
00:34:33,643 --> 00:34:34,943
What's going on?

190
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,253
Where do I know Richard from?

191
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:17,970
Have we met him before?

192
00:35:21,266 --> 00:35:23,021
Ero-topa-thy.

193
00:35:49,938 --> 00:35:51,488
Alright, I'm leaving.

194
00:35:52,823 --> 00:35:54,023
Not necessary.

195
00:39:07,975 --> 00:39:09,114
Hello, Annie.

196
00:39:17,126 --> 00:39:19,276
Maybe someone else is coming too.

197
00:39:21,664 --> 00:39:23,065
Did Johnny leave?

198
00:39:23,878 --> 00:39:24,928
Don't know.

199
00:39:26,092 --> 00:39:28,142
I don't understand men anymore.

200
00:39:28,837 --> 00:39:32,287
I know a woman who waited
ten years for the man she loved.

201
00:39:33,492 --> 00:39:34,792
She used to say:

202
00:39:34,842 --> 00:39:38,442
"If he wants to see me one more
time he's got to come today".

203
00:39:43,332 --> 00:39:46,232
Sure enough he came and
they wanted to leave...

204
00:39:46,282 --> 00:39:49,232
But at the last moment
her boyfriend killed her.

205
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:51,610
Because he couldn't accept it.

206
00:39:57,766 --> 00:40:01,193
What are you doing here?
- I could ask you the same.

207
00:40:07,385 --> 00:40:10,085
You look like you've
expected someone else.

208
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:14,529
I expected no one else.
I just wanted a drink with Moni.

209
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:22,251
He shot her?
- No, he stabbed her with a knife.

210
00:40:25,648 --> 00:40:28,648
What will you give me
if I give this back to you?

211
00:40:37,046 --> 00:40:38,496
A night without me.

212
00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:47,329
What do you think is up with her?

213
00:40:48,774 --> 00:40:50,950
She's about to detach from you.

214
00:42:02,432 --> 00:42:04,732
How many are in?
- Almost sold out.

215
00:42:08,563 --> 00:42:10,163
Where's Miss Bockmann?

216
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,140
She felt sick and went out
to get some air.

217
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,620
<i>Yeah?</i>
- It's me. He just came in.

218
00:42:24,937 --> 00:42:27,587
<i>Fuck!</i>
- I told him you went out for a sec.

219
00:43:08,327 --> 00:43:11,627
Don't forget to switch off
the lights before you leave.

220
00:43:23,036 --> 00:43:24,786
He's eavesdropping again.

221
00:43:28,455 --> 00:43:30,892
"Don't forget to
switch off the lights"

222
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,190
Blah-blah.

223
00:43:32,825 --> 00:43:34,675
It's going on all the time.

224
00:43:34,725 --> 00:43:36,604
He wouldn't say one peep.

225
00:43:37,856 --> 00:43:40,816
Even if we kept
all the lights on. Jackass

226
00:43:41,143 --> 00:43:44,514
If I told a single word
about him grabbing my butt

227
00:43:44,564 --> 00:43:48,380
he'd have a heart attack and
drop dead.

228
00:43:52,071 --> 00:43:55,621
Idiot! I'm going to break my neck
because of his stinginess!

229
00:44:49,821 --> 00:44:51,671
Can you explain this to me?

230
00:44:53,108 --> 00:44:54,771
I'm assigned to kill you.

231
00:45:03,747 --> 00:45:06,347
What am I supposed to do
with this thing?

232
00:45:07,436 --> 00:45:09,286
I want you to do it for me.

233
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:12,950
Right now?

234
00:45:14,755 --> 00:45:16,705
You've got twenty-four hours.

235
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:21,840
Is this why you were looking for me?
- Private issues don't matter.

236
00:45:38,238 --> 00:45:39,489
Let me out.

237
00:45:50,432 --> 00:45:52,082
You have a screw loose.

238
00:47:16,003 --> 00:47:17,553
So that's your movie?

239
00:47:20,256 --> 00:47:22,572
Good casting. Congratulations.

240
00:47:22,964 --> 00:47:23,964
Out!

241
00:51:49,173 --> 00:51:51,923
You're Miss Messerschmidt, right?
- No.

242
00:51:51,973 --> 00:51:53,773
Of course, I know you!

243
00:52:15,416 --> 00:52:18,647
"Keep me in mind!
Twelve hours left."

244
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:20,756
You only have one chance."

245
00:53:49,396 --> 00:53:52,296
Someone asked for you.
- What did he look like?

246
00:53:52,846 --> 00:53:54,741
A cute guy.
- Was he here?

247
00:53:55,029 --> 00:53:56,386
Five minutes ago.

248
00:53:57,723 --> 00:53:59,173
Who was it anyways?

249
00:54:00,762 --> 00:54:02,212
Cinema Goetheplatz.

250
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:05,870
Got a cigarette?

251
00:54:47,251 --> 00:54:49,409
<i>The rear entrance is open.</i>
- Fuck.

252
00:54:49,643 --> 00:54:51,669
<i>Is Marion there?</i>
- She exploded.

253
00:55:33,405 --> 00:55:37,807
<i>This is the answering machine.
Currently I'm not home.</i>

254
00:55:39,593 --> 00:55:42,606
<i>You have 30 seconds
to leave a message.</i>

255
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:45,700
<i>Please don't forget
to leave your name.</i>

256
00:55:46,429 --> 00:55:47,429
<i>Speak now.</i>

257
00:55:49,058 --> 00:55:50,080
Asshole.

258
00:57:11,179 --> 00:57:12,329
Take it easy!

259
00:57:17,973 --> 00:57:20,043
There it is in black and white.

260
00:57:20,602 --> 00:57:22,952
"Assassination at film opening:

261
00:57:23,205 --> 00:57:24,955
'Love me or I kill Reagan.'

262
00:57:25,283 --> 00:57:29,190
Was John W. Hinckley trying
to force the love

263
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:33,879
of movie star Jodie Foster
with his bloody deed?"

264
00:57:34,291 --> 00:57:35,791
"A man takes revenge!

265
00:57:35,841 --> 00:57:39,136
Repulsed by filth,
violence and godlessness

266
00:57:39,186 --> 00:57:45,125
of the American city life
he strikes out on everything wicked.

267
00:57:45,466 --> 00:57:49,291
He shoots down a robber and a pimp.

268
00:57:49,623 --> 00:57:54,723
He tells a juvenile hooker, 'If you
don't love me I'll kill the president'

269
00:57:55,413 --> 00:57:57,247
But this does not happen...

270
00:57:57,297 --> 00:58:00,575
But this does not happen.
In a brutal slaughter

271
00:58:00,625 --> 00:58:03,544
the avenger is gunned
down by the Police.

272
00:58:03,682 --> 00:58:06,551
Showdown of the US movie
Taxi Driver".

273
00:58:09,378 --> 00:58:11,528
The movie ends totally different.

274
00:59:13,108 --> 00:59:14,308
Glad you came.

275
00:59:15,562 --> 00:59:17,512
Can you show me how it works?

276
01:02:18,053 --> 01:02:19,503
Can I have a coffee?

277
01:02:41,232 --> 01:02:44,182
Your boyfriend is losing
to Richard in the back.

278
01:02:44,357 --> 01:02:46,307
What do you mean 'boyfriend'?

279
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Let's go.

280
01:04:12,454 --> 01:04:14,104
You're out of the game.

281
01:04:50,050 --> 01:04:51,550
We go to your place.

282
01:04:57,568 --> 01:04:58,968
We go to my place.

283
01:04:59,526 --> 01:05:01,826
I haven't been there for two months.

284
01:08:16,210 --> 01:08:17,310
Is that all?

285
01:16:06,111 --> 01:16:08,061
To the Mathaeser Movie Palace.

286
01:17:24,032 --> 01:17:27,133
One ticket please.
- The movie started 30 minutes ago.

287
01:17:27,183 --> 01:17:28,528
Doesn't matter.
