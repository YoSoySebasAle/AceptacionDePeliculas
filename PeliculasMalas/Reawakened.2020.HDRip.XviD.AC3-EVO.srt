00:02:32,645 --> 00:02:34,914
Michele, Michele.

3
00:02:35,782 --> 00:02:37,917
Miss me, miss me, miss me?

4
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,219
What do you want from me?

5
00:02:42,255 --> 00:02:45,892
Michele,
Michele, Michele.

6
00:02:45,925 --> 00:02:47,627
Join me.

7
00:02:54,499 --> 00:02:55,400
Michele, Michele!

8
00:02:56,535 --> 00:02:58,204
I'm right here.

9
00:02:58,237 --> 00:02:59,739
Calm down.

10
00:02:59,772 --> 00:03:01,707
Oh, no, no, no, I don't
wanna go back to sleep.

11
00:03:01,741 --> 00:03:03,109
No, please, no.

12
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:04,342
Everything's
gonna be all right.

13
00:03:04,376 --> 00:03:05,377
No, please.

14
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:07,914
Calm down, take deep breaths.

15
00:04:08,641 --> 00:04:09,642
Dr. Flanagan.

16
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:13,378
Good morning, Detective.

17
00:04:13,411 --> 00:04:14,814
How's she doing?

18
00:04:14,847 --> 00:04:17,350
Well, physically
there's nothing wrong.

19
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,619
However, she is still
suffering from PTSD.

20
00:04:20,653 --> 00:04:23,923
Oh, I know all about post
traumatic stress disorder,

21
00:04:23,956 --> 00:04:26,524
but it has been a week
and she's the only one

22
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:27,960
that can provide us answers.

23
00:04:29,362 --> 00:04:31,831
Keep it short and avoid
going out of her comfort zone.

24
00:04:31,864 --> 00:04:32,965
- Got it.
- All right.

25
00:04:32,999 --> 00:04:34,399
- Thanks so much.
- Mm-hmm.

26
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:37,502
So I'll bring in some pizza?

27
00:04:42,607 --> 00:04:46,245
Detective, does the
doctor know you're here?

28
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:48,814
Yes, Mrs. Chadwick,
I have his approval.

29
00:04:49,749 --> 00:04:50,582
Hi, Michele.

30
00:04:52,051 --> 00:04:55,788
I'm sorry to bother you but I
do need to get your statement.

31
00:04:55,821 --> 00:04:57,924
Oh, Dr. Flanagan.

32
00:04:57,957 --> 00:04:59,659
Don't you think it's
too early for Michele

33
00:04:59,692 --> 00:05:01,727
to be talking about this?

34
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:03,296
Well, as I mentioned
to the detective,

35
00:05:03,329 --> 00:05:04,897
she needs to keep it short

36
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:06,866
and not exceed what
Michele can handle.

37
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:11,404
I'm gonna record
your statement now.

38
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,239
Please state your
full name and age.

39
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:22,148
Michele Chadwick, 22.

40
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:27,186
It's okay, just
take your time.

41
00:05:27,219 --> 00:05:28,821
Tell me everything you remember.

42
00:05:31,357 --> 00:05:32,959
Where do you want me to start?

43
00:05:36,662 --> 00:05:39,131
Why don't you start at
the beginning of the trip?

44
00:05:43,336 --> 00:05:44,904
Okay, well we had
been talking about

45
00:05:44,937 --> 00:05:47,340
this camping trip
for like a few weeks.

46
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,411
And the night before,
Sophia and I...

47
00:05:52,445 --> 00:05:56,215
Yo, this list reminds me
of when we were at camp

48
00:05:56,248 --> 00:05:57,650
and they would tell
us to bring stuff.

49
00:05:57,683 --> 00:05:59,652
That was my idea.

50
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:01,187
That's where I got
the inspiration from.

51
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,089
Besides, I've trying to make
it simple for all the guys.

52
00:06:03,122 --> 00:06:05,791
Oh, what do you
expect, they're jocks.

53
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:07,893
One of us happens to be
dating one of those jocks.

54
00:06:07,927 --> 00:06:10,696
You know what, Travis
is the exception.

55
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,564
He's got brains,

56
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,835
- amongst other things.
- Ugh.

57
00:06:15,868 --> 00:06:17,703
And you're right, I really
shouldn't be judging them.

58
00:06:17,737 --> 00:06:20,373
Yeah, especially somebody
who's a psychology major.

59
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:25,978
Text from Rachel.

60
00:06:26,012 --> 00:06:28,814
"I can't make it tonight,
see you in the morning."

61
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:30,850
Thanks for the
short notice, Rachel.

62
00:06:32,284 --> 00:06:34,619
I knew she was gonna do
that so I packed extra.

63
00:06:36,122 --> 00:06:38,824
"Okay, see you tomorrow."

64
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:41,994
You know, this is you and
all your animal lover stuff.

65
00:06:42,028 --> 00:06:44,964
Hey, animal lovers
can't be animal eaters.

66
00:06:44,997 --> 00:06:47,233
Oh, so you're calling
me animal hater?

67
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,001
Maybe.

68
00:06:52,772 --> 00:06:54,707
Dude, I'm so excited
for this trip.

69
00:06:55,808 --> 00:06:58,610
You know, hot
springs, the pines,

70
00:06:58,644 --> 00:07:00,679
getting all of us together.

71
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:04,650
Yeah, I know, and
you got marshmallows.

72
00:07:05,651 --> 00:07:07,953
Lots and lots of marshmallows.

73
00:07:09,355 --> 00:07:10,723
Of course.

74
00:07:10,756 --> 00:07:12,091
More marshmallows.

75
00:07:13,426 --> 00:07:15,294
More animal-free stuff.

76
00:07:15,327 --> 00:07:18,864
You're stupid.

77
00:07:43,055 --> 00:07:43,956
Hey.

78
00:07:43,989 --> 00:07:45,623
Hope I got these right.

79
00:07:45,658 --> 00:07:47,326
Morning, sunshine.

80
00:07:47,359 --> 00:07:48,828
Thank you, Travis.

81
00:07:48,861 --> 00:07:49,962
Sorry about last night, guys.

82
00:07:49,995 --> 00:07:51,931
I had to close up shop.

83
00:07:51,964 --> 00:07:54,400
We're just glad
you could make it.

84
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:55,868
Did you forget something?

85
00:07:55,901 --> 00:07:57,837
There's more in the back.

86
00:08:04,343 --> 00:08:06,812
Well, I think I got everything.

87
00:08:06,846 --> 00:08:09,215
So, Travis, how many
footballers are coming?

88
00:08:10,382 --> 00:08:13,085
Girl, you did not just
call them footballers.

89
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:17,289
You wanna mingle, you
need to know the lingo.

90
00:08:17,323 --> 00:08:19,692
They're called soccer players.

91
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:41,080
What's up, chaps?

92
00:08:41,113 --> 00:08:42,348
Hey, guys.

93
00:08:42,381 --> 00:08:44,550
Okay, guys, quick
intro for Rachel.

94
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,785
This is Nate, he's
in two of my classes.

95
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:48,020
Yep, that's me.

96
00:08:48,053 --> 00:08:48,888
Enchanté.

97
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,760
Okay and this is
Brandon and Jessica.

98
00:08:54,793 --> 00:08:56,328
Brandon's also on the
team and Jessica--

99
00:08:56,362 --> 00:08:57,631
Is his girlfriend.

100
00:08:57,663 --> 00:08:58,964
Ah.

101
00:08:58,998 --> 00:09:01,600
Definitely see you
guys are a couple.

102
00:09:01,635 --> 00:09:05,004
Good, so then there shouldn't
be any misunderstandings.

103
00:09:05,037 --> 00:09:07,239
No, no misunderstanding
here, sweetie.

104
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:12,878
So, what is this
place we're going to?

105
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,581
Beckon Falls.

106
00:10:16,275 --> 00:10:18,444
I actually was on
SNL for like a minute.

107
00:10:18,477 --> 00:10:19,311
Who?

108
00:10:21,046 --> 00:10:22,081
Who was?

109
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:36,195
14 miles?

110
00:10:36,228 --> 00:10:37,930
Hey, you can do it.

111
00:10:37,963 --> 00:10:39,265
Of course, I'll be fine.

112
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,035
I don't like the way that
blonde bitch looks at you.

113
00:10:43,068 --> 00:10:44,970
Yeah, well, be
nice Jess, all right?

114
00:10:51,277 --> 00:10:52,278
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

115
00:10:52,311 --> 00:10:53,812
How you holding up?

116
00:10:53,846 --> 00:10:57,249
Between Pilates and Cardio
Barre, I can walk all day.

117
00:10:57,283 --> 00:10:58,718
You all right?

118
00:10:58,752 --> 00:11:01,186
Why does everyone think
I can't walk this far?

119
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,988
Okay, sensitive.

120
00:11:03,022 --> 00:11:04,990
You don't do that
much hiking, do you?

121
00:11:05,024 --> 00:11:06,225
It shows?

122
00:11:06,258 --> 00:11:08,260
Well, for one, the
pack is too heavy.

123
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:10,462
I thought it seemed
a little bit big

124
00:11:10,496 --> 00:11:13,565
but I just brought whatever
Sophia told me to bring.

125
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:14,933
Uh huh.

126
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:16,568
Here, let's trade.

127
00:11:16,602 --> 00:11:19,238
I think I can handle
yours better than you can.

128
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:21,173
- You sure?
- It's okay.

129
00:11:24,376 --> 00:11:27,446
Yours is so much
lighter than mine.

130
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:30,215
Last time I went fishing
and hiking and camping,

131
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:32,051
I was in the Boy Scouts.

132
00:11:32,084 --> 00:11:33,052
So you were?

133
00:11:33,085 --> 00:11:34,386
Yeah, since I was 10.

134
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,321
Cute.

135
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:03,683
All right, the directions
point to the right.

136
00:12:03,717 --> 00:12:05,384
But that doesn't make any sense.

137
00:12:05,417 --> 00:12:07,219
Like, that road looks
like its going back down

138
00:12:07,252 --> 00:12:08,887
- the way we came.
- Just give me the directions.

139
00:12:18,765 --> 00:12:20,800
That's weird, I
can't get a signal.

140
00:12:20,834 --> 00:12:23,402
Oh, I forgot to mention,
there's no cell service out here.

141
00:12:23,435 --> 00:12:25,003
Even I knew that.

142
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,442
The lake is supposed to
be at a higher elevation.

143
00:12:30,476 --> 00:12:32,277
That road leads down.

144
00:12:32,311 --> 00:12:34,146
Look, on the soccer field,
you might be team captain

145
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:35,648
but this is my turf

146
00:12:35,682 --> 00:12:37,249
and I don't need some
stupid map, it's obvious.

147
00:12:37,282 --> 00:12:38,752
Hey, chill out, dude!

148
00:12:38,785 --> 00:12:39,786
This isn't a competition.

149
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:41,286
I know what I'm doing!

150
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,355
If Sophia's cousin says to
go right, we're going right!

151
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:45,591
Okay, easy boys.

152
00:12:45,624 --> 00:12:48,594
Come on, what Brandon
says makes sense.

153
00:12:48,628 --> 00:12:50,028
Okay, let's just
follow the directions

154
00:12:50,062 --> 00:12:51,397
and if we don't start
heading upwards,

155
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,298
we'll turn back around.

156
00:12:53,332 --> 00:12:54,667
Okay?

157
00:12:54,701 --> 00:12:55,501
All right.

158
00:12:56,502 --> 00:12:57,369
You heard the boss.

159
00:12:58,504 --> 00:12:59,672
Let's go.

160
00:13:14,186 --> 00:13:16,522
Nate, are you sure you
don't mind carrying my stuff?

161
00:13:16,555 --> 00:13:17,589
Yo, I got it.

162
00:13:17,623 --> 00:13:19,224
All right, you're a lifesaver.

163
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:20,392
Hey, no problem.

164
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:21,927
Hey, I see you
brought a mini rod.

165
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,162
Yeah, of course.

166
00:13:23,195 --> 00:13:25,330
She told me there's
a great fishing spot.

167
00:13:25,364 --> 00:13:26,331
What?

168
00:13:26,365 --> 00:13:28,200
Oh, that's cool.

169
00:13:28,233 --> 00:13:30,569
I always thought there was
something different about you.

170
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:32,171
Maybe you could show
me how to catch a few?

171
00:13:32,204 --> 00:13:33,405
Yeah, for sure.

172
00:13:56,528 --> 00:13:59,833
All right, guys,
let's take a break.

173
00:13:59,866 --> 00:14:00,700
Finally.

174
00:14:02,134 --> 00:14:04,771
I'm sure it'll start
going up hill again soon.

175
00:14:04,804 --> 00:14:06,104
How far do you
think we've come?

176
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:07,606
Should be about halfway.

177
00:14:09,508 --> 00:14:10,342
Hey.

178
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:14,480
I'm sorry.

179
00:14:14,513 --> 00:14:15,748
For what?

180
00:14:15,782 --> 00:14:18,116
For being short
with you earlier.

181
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,719
You're a tough little cookie.

182
00:14:19,752 --> 00:14:21,253
I know you can handle it.

183
00:14:22,221 --> 00:14:24,691
Guys?

184
00:14:24,724 --> 00:14:26,659
I see some anger in the clouds.

185
00:14:26,693 --> 00:14:28,260
It's not looking good.

186
00:14:28,293 --> 00:14:30,663
Yeah, we should probably
start pulling out our rain gear.

187
00:14:36,235 --> 00:14:37,236
Hey, look over there.

188
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:38,838
Is that a building?

189
00:14:45,912 --> 00:14:47,981
Yeah, that's a
house all right.

190
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:49,949
Looks abandoned though.

191
00:14:51,116 --> 00:14:52,150
Let's check it out.

192
00:14:54,821 --> 00:14:55,655
Come on.

193
00:15:19,812 --> 00:15:22,247
What's this place doing here?

194
00:15:46,438 --> 00:15:47,774
All right, move.

195
00:15:53,512 --> 00:15:54,313
I'm going in.

196
00:15:54,346 --> 00:15:56,248
Are you nuts?

197
00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:04,389
Well, all right.

198
00:16:04,423 --> 00:16:05,658
Yep.

199
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:18,805
Well, there's no electricity.

200
00:16:18,838 --> 00:16:20,539
It's all right, we'll survive.

201
00:16:20,572 --> 00:16:21,841
Yeah we will.

202
00:16:23,241 --> 00:16:25,243
Why do you guys
think it's abandoned?

203
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:27,546
Who cares, it's ours now.

204
00:16:35,088 --> 00:16:36,089
You say something?

205
00:16:38,423 --> 00:16:40,425
I didn't say anything.

206
00:16:43,462 --> 00:16:44,563
How convenient.

207
00:16:47,634 --> 00:16:48,768
Woo!

208
00:16:50,737 --> 00:16:53,640
Guys, guys, guys.

209
00:16:53,673 --> 00:16:55,842
A little elbow grease and
this place will be good as new.

210
00:18:46,351 --> 00:18:47,687
There you are.

211
00:18:49,989 --> 00:18:51,858
What the hell is that?

212
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:55,360
What?

213
00:18:55,393 --> 00:18:57,163
That voodoo stuff.

214
00:18:59,866 --> 00:19:00,700
Weird.

215
00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:05,171
You okay?

216
00:19:06,404 --> 00:19:08,040
Yeah.

217
00:19:08,074 --> 00:19:09,642
What you got there?

218
00:19:09,675 --> 00:19:10,676
What you got?

219
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,711
I found it.

220
00:19:13,045 --> 00:19:14,412
- Well does it open?
- No.

221
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:18,283
Okay, cool.

222
00:19:18,316 --> 00:19:19,952
Finders keepers.

223
00:19:23,156 --> 00:19:24,123
Do you hear that?

224
00:19:25,892 --> 00:19:26,726
Hear what?

225
00:19:31,197 --> 00:19:32,031
Never mind.

226
00:19:33,598 --> 00:19:35,768
Okay, well we're
going to start dinner.

227
00:19:35,802 --> 00:19:37,203
Okay, I'll be right there.

228
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,905
Okay.

229
00:19:51,684 --> 00:19:52,952
Hey, did you find her?

230
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:54,486
Oh yeah, she's coming.

231
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:56,189
Let's just go get
dinner started.

232
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:00,860
I will choke
that blonde bitch.

233
00:20:00,893 --> 00:20:03,262
Oh, I love it
when you get angry.

234
00:20:03,296 --> 00:20:04,429
I know you do.

235
00:20:04,462 --> 00:20:06,999
Hey!

236
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:08,668
We gotta go get dinner started.

237
00:20:08,701 --> 00:20:10,102
Sorry, there's just something

238
00:20:10,136 --> 00:20:12,071
about a mountain man, you know?

239
00:20:12,104 --> 00:20:13,039
Okay.

240
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:15,241
Come on.

241
00:20:15,274 --> 00:20:16,408
We will finish this later.

242
00:20:16,441 --> 00:20:17,243
Oh, we better.

243
00:20:17,276 --> 00:20:18,476
No, we won't.

244
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,080
I'm just gonna go help
Travis out, all right?

245
00:20:31,556 --> 00:20:33,659
Nothing like a
bunch of busy beavers.

246
00:20:33,693 --> 00:20:36,095
You did not just
call us beavers.

247
00:20:36,128 --> 00:20:38,331
I don't think she
meant anything by that.

248
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:40,266
Figure of speech.

249
00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:43,903
Oh, I guess I just expected
more from a college girl.

250
00:20:43,936 --> 00:20:46,239
Okay, you know, the beaver's
one of the most diligent

251
00:20:46,272 --> 00:20:48,941
and hardworking
animals on the planet.

252
00:20:48,975 --> 00:20:50,442
Right, Jess?

253
00:20:50,475 --> 00:20:51,844
Yeah, that's what I meant.

254
00:20:57,884 --> 00:20:59,919
Now give me something to do.

255
00:20:59,952 --> 00:21:00,753
Here.

256
00:21:00,786 --> 00:21:01,988
Do something with those.

257
00:21:21,307 --> 00:21:22,141
Hey.

258
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,811
You were right about the road.

259
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,614
We should've taken
the other one.

260
00:21:31,684 --> 00:21:32,484
We cool?

261
00:21:33,986 --> 00:21:35,354
Yeah, cool.

262
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:38,456
We should head back
the other way tomorrow.

263
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:43,195
You got it.

264
00:21:52,504 --> 00:21:53,673
Who's thirsty?

265
00:21:53,706 --> 00:21:54,907
Yeah!

266
00:21:56,676 --> 00:21:57,442
My dude.

267
00:21:59,211 --> 00:22:01,147
Hey, Brandon, where'd
you score that bottle?

268
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,082
Courtesy of my pops.

269
00:22:08,321 --> 00:22:09,155
My dog.

270
00:22:10,189 --> 00:22:10,990
All right.

271
00:22:11,023 --> 00:22:11,857
Yeah, yeah.

272
00:22:13,993 --> 00:22:14,794
Oh,

273
00:22:16,028 --> 00:22:17,296
can you handle this?

274
00:22:18,931 --> 00:22:19,765
Try me.

275
00:22:21,233 --> 00:22:22,068
Say when.

276
00:22:23,135 --> 00:22:23,970
When! When!

277
00:22:27,505 --> 00:22:29,208
Are you trying to get me drunk?

278
00:22:29,241 --> 00:22:30,076
Uh.

279
00:22:35,815 --> 00:22:36,649
Mmmm.

280
00:22:43,089 --> 00:22:46,092
Have a good time over
there with Goldilocks?

281
00:22:46,125 --> 00:22:46,926
What?

282
00:22:48,995 --> 00:22:52,398
I saw you completely
undressing her with your eyes.

283
00:22:52,431 --> 00:22:54,166
I was just pouring some rum.

284
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,668
Mm-hmm.

285
00:22:55,701 --> 00:22:57,535
Besides, the only one
I'm undressing with my eyes

286
00:22:58,437 --> 00:23:00,873
- is you.
- Uh huh.

287
00:23:00,906 --> 00:23:02,008
Hmmm? Hmmm?

288
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,613
Shut up.

289
00:23:12,084 --> 00:23:13,152
- Hey.
- Hi.

290
00:23:14,353 --> 00:23:17,857
Hey, so, you have
a thing for Brandon?

291
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:18,657
What?

292
00:23:18,691 --> 00:23:20,092
No way.

293
00:23:20,126 --> 00:23:22,028
I just like pushing
Jessica's buttons.

294
00:23:22,928 --> 00:23:25,197
Oh.

295
00:23:25,231 --> 00:23:26,065
Okay.

296
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,968
To pushing buttons.

297
00:23:29,935 --> 00:23:31,771
To new friends.

298
00:23:33,605 --> 00:23:34,407
Yeah.

299
00:23:35,808 --> 00:23:36,608
Yeah.

300
00:23:37,476 --> 00:23:38,610
New friends.

301
00:23:46,318 --> 00:23:48,521
So do you still have
any energy leftover?

302
00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:51,457
Oh, I think I am wide awake.

303
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,759
Oh, let me see what you got.

304
00:23:53,793 --> 00:23:54,592
Oh.

305
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:23,689
Yo, that food was
on point tonight.

306
00:24:23,722 --> 00:24:24,557
Thank you.

307
00:24:25,391 --> 00:24:26,624
Teamwork.

308
00:24:32,898 --> 00:24:35,501
Is she doing that
for our benefit?

309
00:24:35,534 --> 00:24:36,368
Probably.

310
00:24:37,703 --> 00:24:39,205
That's so Jess.

311
00:24:42,508 --> 00:24:45,244
Hey, how about some
ghost stories or something?

312
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:47,012
Oh, I love scary stories.

313
00:24:47,947 --> 00:24:49,215
Do you know any?

314
00:24:49,248 --> 00:24:53,319
No, no, no, no, I
get scared too easily.

315
00:24:53,352 --> 00:24:55,087
Listen to my music,
thank you very much.

316
00:24:55,955 --> 00:24:56,789
Fucking wuss.

317
00:24:57,923 --> 00:24:59,158
Well I know one.

318
00:24:59,191 --> 00:25:01,026
All right, well let
me know when you done.

319
00:25:02,361 --> 00:25:03,562
Okay, go on, go on.

320
00:25:03,596 --> 00:25:05,831
Just stop keeping
us in suspense.

321
00:25:05,865 --> 00:25:06,699
All right.

322
00:25:08,367 --> 00:25:12,004
There once was this
very sexy girl.

323
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:15,508
Okay, why does
she have to be sexy?

324
00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:19,278
I mean, can't she be
intelligent or plain?

325
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:21,914
Who's telling the
story, you or me?

326
00:25:21,947 --> 00:25:23,549
Okay, go on, tell your story.

327
00:25:24,717 --> 00:25:26,318
Okay.

328
00:25:26,352 --> 00:25:29,455
So, this intelligent and kind
of plain-looking girl, Nina,

329
00:25:29,488 --> 00:25:31,624
starting partying way too much.

330
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:34,093
All right, you
made your point.

331
00:25:34,126 --> 00:25:36,595
Just tell you story
how you want it.

332
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,330
All right.

333
00:25:38,364 --> 00:25:43,369
This hot chick named Nina
started partying way too much.

334
00:25:44,837 --> 00:25:47,506
Her grades were slipping,
so her parents grounded her.

335
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,576
Now, if her grades improved,
they have her a second chance

336
00:25:50,609 --> 00:25:52,646
but with an early curfew.

337
00:25:53,812 --> 00:25:57,316
Now, as you can guess,
on her first night out,

338
00:25:57,349 --> 00:25:59,051
Nina was having such a good time

339
00:25:59,084 --> 00:26:01,655
that she didn't make
it back on time.

340
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:03,889
And when she finally
did get home,

341
00:26:03,923 --> 00:26:06,592
she found all the lights out.

342
00:26:07,661 --> 00:26:08,928
She tried the front door,

343
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:10,796
wasn't locked.

344
00:26:11,964 --> 00:26:14,433
So instead of just
going on inside,

345
00:26:14,466 --> 00:26:17,169
she went around back and
climbed the old oak tree

346
00:26:17,203 --> 00:26:18,437
beneath her bedroom window,

347
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:20,206
as she had done so
many times before.

348
00:26:21,607 --> 00:26:24,376
Next morning, Nina
wakes up early.

349
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:27,647
It was quiet,

350
00:26:28,781 --> 00:26:32,551
so she thought maybe
her folks went into town

351
00:26:32,585 --> 00:26:33,552
without waking her.

352
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:36,889
When she reaches the
bottom of the stairs,

353
00:26:36,922 --> 00:26:39,592
she sees blood everywhere.

354
00:26:39,626 --> 00:26:40,793
She runs in the living room

355
00:26:40,826 --> 00:26:42,795
to find her parents'
mangled bodies.

356
00:26:42,828 --> 00:26:46,298
She screams when she
sees written on the walls

357
00:26:46,332 --> 00:26:48,334
in their blood the words,

358
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:50,736
"Lucky you didn't
open the door."

359
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:56,141
Asshole, you trying to
give me a heart attack?

360
00:26:56,175 --> 00:26:58,777
Look, I'm sorry, I
heard this story before

361
00:26:58,811 --> 00:27:00,212
and I thought it would be funny.

362
00:27:00,246 --> 00:27:02,881
Yeah, that's your
problem, you don't think.

363
00:27:02,915 --> 00:27:03,816
At least, not with your head.

364
00:27:03,849 --> 00:27:05,317
Whoa.

365
00:27:05,351 --> 00:27:06,819
Coming back to bed?

366
00:27:06,852 --> 00:27:08,120
Mmmm, in a minute.

367
00:27:10,022 --> 00:27:11,924
Goodnight, everyone.

368
00:27:11,957 --> 00:27:13,158
- Night.
- Goodnight, guys.

369
00:27:13,192 --> 00:27:13,993
See y'all.

370
00:27:14,026 --> 00:27:15,527
Well, goodnight.

371
00:27:17,162 --> 00:27:17,963
Night.

372
00:27:17,997 --> 00:27:19,398
Night, guys.

373
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:20,266
Night, y'all.

374
00:27:21,668 --> 00:27:23,670
Hey, it's okay if you
guys want the other bedroom.

375
00:27:23,703 --> 00:27:26,505
Oh, it's all right, we
can just stay with you.

376
00:27:26,538 --> 00:27:28,407
One big slumber party.

377
00:27:41,353 --> 00:27:45,124
There's my personal heater.

378
00:29:15,481 --> 00:29:16,515
This is her weapon.

379
00:29:35,835 --> 00:29:39,338
Why do you hurt these
poor children of Christ?

380
00:29:39,371 --> 00:29:41,841
What harm have
they done unto you?

381
00:29:41,875 --> 00:29:43,142
I do no hurt them.

382
00:29:45,244 --> 00:29:47,179
Abigail Barker,

383
00:29:47,212 --> 00:29:50,182
you are charged with
sundry acts of witchcraft,

384
00:29:50,215 --> 00:29:51,617
committed unto the bodies

385
00:29:51,651 --> 00:29:54,687
of Mercy Lewis, Ann
Putnam and others.

386
00:29:54,721 --> 00:29:56,856
I'm innocent, I
know nothing of it.

387
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:59,258
I have done no witchcraft.

388
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:01,193
You are charged
with tempting them

389
00:30:01,226 --> 00:30:03,663
to sign the Devil's book.

390
00:30:03,696 --> 00:30:06,565
It's that said book.

391
00:30:06,598 --> 00:30:07,966
Tis false, I tell thee!

392
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,068
I've done no wrong!

393
00:30:10,102 --> 00:30:12,839
She bears the mark
of Satan himself!

394
00:30:12,872 --> 00:30:13,873
It's over her heart!

395
00:30:33,992 --> 00:30:35,795
There is no denying.

396
00:30:36,995 --> 00:30:38,330
Who do you serve?

397
00:30:38,363 --> 00:30:39,398
I serve no one.

398
00:30:39,431 --> 00:30:41,333
Then you serve not our Lord.

399
00:30:41,366 --> 00:30:44,203
What contract have
you signed with Satan?

400
00:30:44,236 --> 00:30:45,939
You put words in my mouth.

401
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:48,808
I have made no contract, I
never saw him in my life.

402
00:30:48,842 --> 00:30:52,244
Anne Putnam saith that the
devil is her god, not I.

403
00:30:53,479 --> 00:30:56,381
Have you not in your
heart to tell the truth?

404
00:30:56,415 --> 00:30:57,817
I do tell the truth.

405
00:30:57,851 --> 00:30:59,485
I never hurt these persons.

406
00:30:59,518 --> 00:31:01,688
I am no witch!

407
00:31:15,534 --> 00:31:18,705
Have you not given consent
that some evil spirit

408
00:31:18,738 --> 00:31:21,139
should do this in your likeness?

409
00:31:21,173 --> 00:31:22,541
No.

410
00:31:22,574 --> 00:31:24,309
I am innocent!

411
00:31:24,343 --> 00:31:27,079
All accusations
against me are false!

412
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,082
Abigail Barker,

413
00:31:30,115 --> 00:31:33,185
I find you guilty
of being a witch!

414
00:31:33,218 --> 00:31:36,890
And I here order to proceed
with your execution!

415
00:31:36,923 --> 00:31:38,390
You are a liar!

416
00:31:38,423 --> 00:31:41,093
I am no more a witch
than you are a wizard.

417
00:31:41,126 --> 00:31:42,294
Take her away!

418
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,130
You will pay for this!

419
00:31:59,511 --> 00:32:00,345
What's wrong?

420
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:03,582
Whoa.

421
00:32:04,684 --> 00:32:06,618
Hey, it was just a little quake.

422
00:32:06,653 --> 00:32:08,021
Is she okay?

423
00:32:08,053 --> 00:32:09,923
- Come here, sweetheart.
- A little shaken up.

424
00:32:09,956 --> 00:32:13,158
Sweetheart, it was
just a little earthquake.

425
00:32:14,126 --> 00:32:14,961
Let's go.

426
00:32:26,806 --> 00:32:28,507
Hey, is she okay?

427
00:32:30,043 --> 00:32:31,044
Oh my God.

428
00:32:34,814 --> 00:32:37,416
And that's when I noticed
that her eyes had changed.

429
00:32:39,151 --> 00:32:40,653
Did
anyone else notice

430
00:32:40,687 --> 00:32:42,187
the change taking place?

431
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,524
I don't know.

432
00:32:45,557 --> 00:32:47,192
It's okay, just
take your time.

433
00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:51,263
I don't know.

434
00:32:52,464 --> 00:32:53,498
I can't remember.

435
00:33:01,741 --> 00:33:03,943
- Honey, what is it?
- What? What?

436
00:33:03,977 --> 00:33:05,377
She's right there!

437
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,545
- She's right there, Grandma!
- There's no one here!

438
00:33:06,578 --> 00:33:07,579
No, no, she's right there!

439
00:33:07,613 --> 00:33:09,114
No, she's right there!

440
00:33:09,147 --> 00:33:11,249
- Who did you see?
- Sophia's right there!

441
00:33:11,283 --> 00:33:12,284
She's right there!
She's right there!

442
00:33:12,317 --> 00:33:13,485
She's right there!

443
00:33:13,518 --> 00:33:14,754
We
don't see anything.

444
00:33:14,787 --> 00:33:15,855
Yes, there's, Grandma,
please save me, Grandma!

445
00:33:15,888 --> 00:33:16,990
You've had enough excitement.

446
00:33:17,023 --> 00:33:18,223
Grandma, Grandma--

447
00:33:18,256 --> 00:33:20,660
This has got to
stop right now.

448
00:33:20,693 --> 00:33:21,928
Please, Grandma, no!

449
00:33:21,961 --> 00:33:23,595
I'm gonna give you
something to relax.

450
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:26,065
No, no, I don't wanna
go back to sleep, please!

451
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:27,466
Doctor, please,
it is very pressing

452
00:33:27,499 --> 00:33:29,836
that we finish her statement!

453
00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:31,104
I understand

454
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,138
but right now I can not
allow you to continue!

455
00:33:34,473 --> 00:33:36,408
All right, I'll
pick this up later.

456
00:33:37,476 --> 00:33:38,845
Mrs. Chadwick--

457
00:33:38,878 --> 00:33:41,213
Do you realize how difficult
this is for all of us?

458
00:33:41,246 --> 00:33:43,716
I understand that
and I respect it

459
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,384
but its very difficult
for the other parents

460
00:33:45,417 --> 00:33:46,451
involved as well.

461
00:33:48,453 --> 00:33:49,656
I'll check back later.

462
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,314
Damn it.

463
00:35:01,526 --> 00:35:02,360
Michele?

464
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:07,200
Detective.

465
00:35:07,232 --> 00:35:08,101
Yeah.

466
00:35:09,936 --> 00:35:11,738
Where's my grandma?

467
00:35:11,771 --> 00:35:12,739
She left.

468
00:35:14,006 --> 00:35:15,273
So, how you feeling?

469
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:17,242
Better.

470
00:35:18,577 --> 00:35:20,278
I don't wanna sleep anymore.

471
00:35:23,149 --> 00:35:24,349
You know, there's
a lot of people

472
00:35:24,382 --> 00:35:26,284
that wanna hear your
side of the story.

473
00:35:28,721 --> 00:35:30,990
I know, it's just hard.

474
00:35:32,491 --> 00:35:34,559
I'm not trying to keep
anything from you.

475
00:35:36,696 --> 00:35:37,529
That's good.

476
00:35:38,965 --> 00:35:41,667
I just want to find out what
happened to your friends.

477
00:35:41,701 --> 00:35:43,236
You ready to continue our talk?

478
00:35:45,138 --> 00:35:46,739
- Okay.
- All right.

479
00:35:47,907 --> 00:35:48,908
So,

480
00:35:48,941 --> 00:35:49,942
what happened next?

481
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:53,780
Well, we were sleeping

482
00:35:55,347 --> 00:35:56,783
and then, in the morning...

483
00:35:58,316 --> 00:36:00,887
You guys, there's no
sign of her out there.

484
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:03,122
Guys, I found her hair

485
00:36:03,156 --> 00:36:04,724
with blood all over it.

486
00:36:05,925 --> 00:36:08,060
You think somebody
kidnapped her?

487
00:36:08,094 --> 00:36:09,829
Why would they only take her?

488
00:36:09,862 --> 00:36:11,097
I don't know

489
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,231
but we've searched
this whole house.

490
00:36:13,331 --> 00:36:14,801
Guys, I'm really scared.

491
00:36:14,834 --> 00:36:16,803
Come on, guys, this is
Sophia we're talking about.

492
00:36:16,836 --> 00:36:19,238
She had to leave
on her own accord.

493
00:36:19,272 --> 00:36:21,741
But why didn't she tell anyone?

494
00:36:21,774 --> 00:36:24,476
And where did all
that blood come from?

495
00:36:24,509 --> 00:36:25,544
That time of the month?

496
00:36:25,577 --> 00:36:26,779
Don't mess around.

497
00:36:26,813 --> 00:36:28,613
Okay, guys, listen up.

498
00:36:28,648 --> 00:36:29,882
We're all gonna
split into groups

499
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:31,150
and we'll search for her
in different directions.

500
00:36:31,184 --> 00:36:32,852
It's the fastest
way to find her.

501
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:36,122
I'll head back down the trail.

502
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,658
I'll go with Brandon.

503
00:36:38,691 --> 00:36:40,893
Good, then Michele and I can
search the trail to the east

504
00:36:40,927 --> 00:36:43,162
and maybe Nate and Rachel
can search to the west.

505
00:36:43,196 --> 00:36:44,697
If we can't get any signal,

506
00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:46,098
how are we supposed to get
in touch with each other?

507
00:36:46,132 --> 00:36:47,599
When you guys do find her,

508
00:36:47,633 --> 00:36:49,035
just have one
person stay with her

509
00:36:49,068 --> 00:36:50,736
and the other person head back.

510
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:52,238
And no matter what,

511
00:36:52,271 --> 00:36:55,274
we're all gonna meet right back
here in one hour, all right?

512
00:36:56,809 --> 00:36:57,710
One hour.

513
00:36:59,245 --> 00:37:00,146
Let's go.

514
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:01,113
Let's go.

515
00:37:03,716 --> 00:37:04,817
Sophia!

516
00:37:04,851 --> 00:37:05,685
Sophia!

517
00:37:06,686 --> 00:37:08,020
Sophia!

518
00:37:08,054 --> 00:37:08,888
Sophia!

519
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:11,991
Sophia!

520
00:37:17,763 --> 00:37:18,931
Sophia!

521
00:37:18,965 --> 00:37:19,799
Sophia!

522
00:37:22,668 --> 00:37:23,501
Sophia?

523
00:37:24,502 --> 00:37:25,805
Where you at?

524
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:26,672
Sophia!

525
00:37:32,144 --> 00:37:33,545
There's no sight of her.

526
00:37:33,578 --> 00:37:36,282
I don't get it, she's
disappeared without a trace.

527
00:37:36,315 --> 00:37:38,516
I don't understand
where she could have gone.

528
00:37:40,518 --> 00:37:41,854
Let's keep looking for her.

529
00:37:49,795 --> 00:37:52,064
Hey, aren't
we at the crossroads?

530
00:37:52,098 --> 00:37:52,932
Yeah.

531
00:37:54,233 --> 00:37:55,067
Sophia!

532
00:38:00,773 --> 00:38:02,275
Do you feel that?

533
00:38:02,308 --> 00:38:03,441
Feel what?

534
00:38:03,475 --> 00:38:06,078
It feels like
someone's watching us.

535
00:38:10,482 --> 00:38:11,984
No, you're imagining things.

536
00:38:17,555 --> 00:38:18,691
Did you hear that?

537
00:38:18,724 --> 00:38:19,557
Yeah.

538
00:38:21,027 --> 00:38:22,728
I think it came from over here.

539
00:38:22,762 --> 00:38:23,561
Come on.

540
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,601
Shit!

541
00:38:29,635 --> 00:38:30,870
Brandon!

542
00:38:35,308 --> 00:38:36,142
Ugh.

543
00:38:37,777 --> 00:38:39,679
Well I didn't expect that.

544
00:38:39,712 --> 00:38:41,681
Are you okay?

545
00:38:41,714 --> 00:38:42,614
I'm okay.

546
00:38:45,483 --> 00:38:46,319
Christ.

547
00:38:49,689 --> 00:38:51,257
I got you.

548
00:39:32,698 --> 00:39:34,100
Is that Sophia?

549
00:39:35,234 --> 00:39:37,136
Yeah, I think so.

550
00:39:37,169 --> 00:39:38,671
- Sophia!
- Sophia!

551
00:39:43,909 --> 00:39:44,910
Oh my God.

552
00:39:50,116 --> 00:39:52,752
Did she dig this with her hands?

553
00:39:52,785 --> 00:39:53,618
Sophia?

554
00:39:54,754 --> 00:39:56,288
Sophia, what's come over you?

555
00:39:57,522 --> 00:39:58,791
Sophia.

556
00:39:58,824 --> 00:39:59,825
Yo, it's me.

557
00:40:01,293 --> 00:40:02,128
Nate.

558
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:10,102
Yo, her hands are like ice.

559
00:40:35,461 --> 00:40:36,695
Stop that!

560
00:40:36,729 --> 00:40:39,965
Stop that, what
is wrong with you?

561
00:40:39,999 --> 00:40:41,867
Sweetie, please just relax.

562
00:40:41,901 --> 00:40:43,436
It's okay, just get some sleep.

563
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:48,507
Is she breathing?

564
00:40:54,647 --> 00:40:56,248
Is she breathing?

565
00:40:59,218 --> 00:41:02,421
- What's wrong with her?
- I don't know, I don't know.

566
00:41:02,455 --> 00:41:04,223
We need to get the
hell out of her.

567
00:41:19,004 --> 00:41:20,406
How is she?

568
00:41:20,439 --> 00:41:21,640
I don't know.

569
00:41:21,674 --> 00:41:23,342
There's something
wrong with her, okay?

570
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:25,244
She's acting very strange.

571
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:27,113
Yeah, she's lost her mind.

572
00:41:27,146 --> 00:41:29,148
We caught her digging a
whole with her bare hands.

573
00:41:29,181 --> 00:41:30,850
Brandon, don't say that.

574
00:41:30,883 --> 00:41:34,887
I mean, she's probably delusional
from the flu or something.

575
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,925
First she finds a necklace,
then her eyes turn all weird.

576
00:41:41,127 --> 00:41:42,828
Now she digs this
book out of a hole.

577
00:41:42,862 --> 00:41:44,897
I mean, she's gotta
be a little crazy.

578
00:41:46,298 --> 00:41:48,567
I can't even read a
word in this book.

579
00:41:48,601 --> 00:41:50,136
It's English.

580
00:41:50,169 --> 00:41:51,504
I know that, you bimbo.

581
00:41:51,537 --> 00:41:53,339
Fuck you, bitch.

582
00:41:53,372 --> 00:41:54,473
Hey, guys chill out.

583
00:41:55,441 --> 00:41:57,510
I meant, it's old English.

584
00:41:57,543 --> 00:41:58,844
And I still can't read it.

585
00:41:59,912 --> 00:42:01,580
Just give it here.

586
00:42:04,817 --> 00:42:06,485
This looks like some kinda

587
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:09,688
Shakespearean writing
stuff or something.

588
00:42:09,722 --> 00:42:11,157
Looks like spells.

589
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:13,292
You guys, it does not matter
what it says in that book.

590
00:42:13,325 --> 00:42:14,793
Right now,

591
00:42:14,827 --> 00:42:16,795
it's Sophia's condition we
should be worried about.

592
00:42:16,829 --> 00:42:18,430
We need to take her
to the hospital.

593
00:42:18,464 --> 00:42:19,899
No.

594
00:42:19,932 --> 00:42:22,301
It wouldn't be safe to
try and make it down now.

595
00:42:22,334 --> 00:42:23,802
Just give her the night to rest

596
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:25,404
and we can head out first
thing tomorrow morning.

597
00:42:25,437 --> 00:42:26,739
I'm with you, bro,

598
00:42:26,772 --> 00:42:29,341
especially with all
this drama going on.

599
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:30,609
You know, Brandon,

600
00:42:30,644 --> 00:42:32,311
you've always had a
way with your words.

601
00:42:32,344 --> 00:42:33,579
You're an asshole!

602
00:42:52,431 --> 00:42:53,199
There you are.

603
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,334
I've been worried.

604
00:42:56,869 --> 00:42:58,837
Just couldn't sleep
thinking about her.

605
00:43:08,414 --> 00:43:09,248
Hey.

606
00:43:10,849 --> 00:43:11,984
Come back to bed, okay?

607
00:43:13,452 --> 00:43:14,286
Huh?

608
00:43:15,588 --> 00:43:19,792
Come on.

609
00:43:24,563 --> 00:43:25,898
Let me finish this.

610
00:43:33,707 --> 00:43:34,540
Okay.

611
00:43:40,112 --> 00:43:43,015
You think Sophia's
losing her mind?

612
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:46,385
Something is wrong with her.

613
00:43:49,255 --> 00:43:50,823
Hey.

614
00:43:50,856 --> 00:43:52,992
Don't keep me waiting
too long, all right?

615
00:43:53,025 --> 00:43:53,859
I won't.

616
00:44:16,081 --> 00:44:16,915
Brandon?

617
00:44:20,219 --> 00:44:21,053
Who's there?

618
00:44:24,556 --> 00:44:25,958
Is that you, Blondie?

619
00:44:29,295 --> 00:44:31,463
If you're trying to scare
me, it's not working!

620
00:44:42,141 --> 00:44:43,542
Where you going?

621
00:44:43,575 --> 00:44:44,910
Come back here, you bitch!

622
00:46:20,939 --> 00:46:23,375
Michele,
what're you doing in here?

623
00:46:24,376 --> 00:46:26,011
I heard footsteps.

624
00:46:27,647 --> 00:46:28,914
I didn't mean to startle you.

625
00:46:28,947 --> 00:46:30,516
I just came back
from my recorder.

626
00:46:30,549 --> 00:46:31,785
No, I'm glad that you did

627
00:46:31,818 --> 00:46:33,085
because I don't wanna
keep this in anymore.

628
00:46:33,118 --> 00:46:34,219
I wanna tell you everything.

629
00:46:34,253 --> 00:46:36,856
All right, come on, let's go.

630
00:46:39,057 --> 00:46:40,627
Just start from the
beginning and tell me

631
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:43,195
everything you wanna
tell me, all right?

632
00:46:44,463 --> 00:46:46,465
Michele, Michele, calm
down, what's wrong?

633
00:46:46,498 --> 00:46:47,299
- What happened?
- She came back!

634
00:46:47,332 --> 00:46:48,701
She came back!

635
00:46:48,735 --> 00:46:50,402
- No, it's okay, calm down.
- Sophia came back!

636
00:46:50,436 --> 00:46:51,704
Detective,
what have you done now?

637
00:46:51,738 --> 00:46:53,539
Nothing, I came in
and she as in the closet

638
00:46:53,572 --> 00:46:55,207
and started screaming.

639
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,309
- Let's get you back in bed.
- Michele.

640
00:46:59,311 --> 00:47:02,047
I need assistance
and page Dr. Flanagan!

641
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,449
Detective, you need to go!

642
00:47:05,017 --> 00:47:05,885
Calm down.

643
00:47:05,919 --> 00:47:07,319
I'll be back, Michele.

644
00:47:07,352 --> 00:47:09,455
I'll be back.

645
00:47:23,569 --> 00:47:24,403
Jessica?

646
00:47:25,304 --> 00:47:26,205
Jessica?

647
00:47:26,238 --> 00:47:27,707
Brandon, what's going on?

648
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:30,509
It's Jessica, she never
came back to bed last night.

649
00:47:30,542 --> 00:47:31,610
She's gotta be
around here somewhere.

650
00:47:31,644 --> 00:47:33,111
No, look, I checked!

651
00:47:33,145 --> 00:47:34,613
Yo, guys,
what's up, man?

652
00:47:34,647 --> 00:47:35,915
Jessica's missing.

653
00:47:35,949 --> 00:47:37,349
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- What?

654
00:47:37,382 --> 00:47:38,718
Sophia's gone too.

655
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:39,819
Ah!

656
00:47:39,853 --> 00:47:40,653
What the hell's going on?

657
00:47:40,687 --> 00:47:41,888
We're fucking cursed!

658
00:47:41,921 --> 00:47:42,822
All right, everybody,
guys, just calm down.

659
00:47:42,856 --> 00:47:44,089
Let's just think this through.

660
00:47:44,122 --> 00:47:45,758
All right, look, you
can stay if you want,

661
00:47:45,792 --> 00:47:47,259
I'm not coming back
here without Jessica!

662
00:47:47,292 --> 00:47:48,560
- Brandon!
- Dude!

663
00:47:48,594 --> 00:47:51,764
Guy, guys, let's just split up

664
00:47:51,798 --> 00:47:52,832
and look for her again, okay?

665
00:47:52,866 --> 00:47:53,999
Split up?

666
00:47:54,032 --> 00:47:54,868
Dude!

667
00:47:56,669 --> 00:47:57,503
Jessica!

668
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:00,940
Jessica!

669
00:48:08,213 --> 00:48:09,047
Jessica!

670
00:48:11,283 --> 00:48:12,117
Sophia!

671
00:48:17,256 --> 00:48:18,090
Jessica!

672
00:48:26,966 --> 00:48:27,800
Jessica!

673
00:48:31,403 --> 00:48:32,237
Jessica!

674
00:48:33,105 --> 00:48:33,907
Where are you?

675
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,407
Come out!

676
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,275
Sophia!

677
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:39,044
Jessica!

678
00:48:43,716 --> 00:48:44,550
Nowhere.

679
00:48:55,561 --> 00:49:00,499
Jess.

680
00:49:02,234 --> 00:49:03,368
Jessica!

681
00:49:03,402 --> 00:49:04,938
Sophia!

682
00:49:04,971 --> 00:49:06,806
Whoa, do you feel that?

683
00:49:06,839 --> 00:49:07,907
No.

684
00:49:07,941 --> 00:49:10,009
There's something here.

685
00:49:11,176 --> 00:49:12,879
Oh, hell no.

686
00:49:12,912 --> 00:49:14,379
Don't even go there.

687
00:49:14,413 --> 00:49:17,884
Right now we just need to
find Jessica and Sophia.

688
00:49:17,917 --> 00:49:18,751
Come on.

689
00:49:27,192 --> 00:49:28,828
Jessica?

690
00:49:44,944 --> 00:49:45,778
Sophia?

691
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:00,793
You're not Sophia.

692
00:50:01,694 --> 00:50:02,662
Who are you?

693
00:50:04,196 --> 00:50:05,297
Abigail Barker.

694
00:50:07,066 --> 00:50:09,802
Don't come any
closer, all right?

695
00:50:11,603 --> 00:50:12,437
I mean it!

696
00:50:14,339 --> 00:50:16,308
What'd you do to Jessica?

697
00:50:16,341 --> 00:50:19,277
She made a good sacrifice.

698
00:50:42,234 --> 00:50:43,703
Did you hear that?

699
00:50:43,736 --> 00:50:44,737
Shit, Brandon!

700
00:50:45,938 --> 00:50:47,807
Sounds like it
came from over there.

701
00:50:51,576 --> 00:50:53,445
- Nate, cut him down.
- Brandon.

702
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:11,931
Oh my God!

703
00:51:11,964 --> 00:51:13,866
We found him hanging.

704
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,400
Who could have done this?

705
00:51:15,434 --> 00:51:17,335
Brandon was the
toughest guy we knew.

706
00:51:18,403 --> 00:51:19,706
I don't know, man!

707
00:51:19,739 --> 00:51:22,240
There's gotta be
more than one killer.

708
00:51:22,274 --> 00:51:24,543
You guys, what're we gonna do?

709
00:51:26,846 --> 00:51:28,147
We can't leave him here.

710
00:51:29,749 --> 00:51:31,651
Let's just take him
back to the house.

711
00:51:47,133 --> 00:51:48,600
This is so unreal.

712
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:51,971
Any ideas?

713
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:54,741
No.

714
00:51:55,975 --> 00:51:57,710
Let's just get the
hell out of here.

715
00:52:04,382 --> 00:52:08,154
I don't know about you but I
really wanna get out of here.

716
00:52:08,187 --> 00:52:10,957
I just can't believe
this is happening.

717
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:13,492
Nobody goes anywhere
without somebody with them.

718
00:52:15,762 --> 00:52:17,163
I wanna get out of here now.

719
00:52:17,196 --> 00:52:18,563
I'm with Rachel on getting
the hell out of here!

720
00:52:18,597 --> 00:52:20,066
We will as soon as it's safe.

721
00:52:20,099 --> 00:52:22,501
We'd never make it
back before nightfall.

722
00:52:22,534 --> 00:52:24,103
Yeah, Travis is right.

723
00:52:24,137 --> 00:52:26,404
We really should
all stay together.

724
00:52:26,438 --> 00:52:28,107
There's strength in numbers.

725
00:52:42,922 --> 00:52:43,756
Guys?

726
00:52:45,323 --> 00:52:46,159
Guys?

727
00:52:47,292 --> 00:52:49,294
Hey, did one of you
leave the backdoor open?

728
00:52:50,196 --> 00:52:51,898
No, not me.

729
00:52:51,931 --> 00:52:53,298
I didn't do it.

730
00:52:53,331 --> 00:52:54,767
Yeah, I wasn't in the kitchen.

731
00:52:54,801 --> 00:52:55,600
Well who did?

732
00:53:03,743 --> 00:53:04,576
There.

733
00:53:06,545 --> 00:53:08,547
Let's go make sure the rest
of this house is secured.

734
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:09,949
Yeah, that's a good idea.

735
00:53:43,415 --> 00:53:44,250
Windows closed.

736
00:53:46,219 --> 00:53:47,887
Travis, I'm so scared.

737
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:48,754
Hey,

738
00:53:49,922 --> 00:53:51,924
I'm here for you, babe.

739
00:53:51,958 --> 00:53:53,626
I won't let anything
happen to you.

740
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:00,733
Oh, hey!

741
00:54:00,766 --> 00:54:01,600
How y'all doin'?

742
00:54:02,601 --> 00:54:03,501
Bedroom is secure.

743
00:54:05,104 --> 00:54:06,672
What does that mean,
that the house is safe now?

744
00:54:06,706 --> 00:54:08,506
As much as we can make it.

745
00:54:36,102 --> 00:54:37,270
I wish there was
something we could do

746
00:54:37,303 --> 00:54:38,871
about Sophia and Jessica.

747
00:54:38,905 --> 00:54:40,472
We need to get help.

748
00:54:40,505 --> 00:54:43,441
Have a real search party
out here looking for them.

749
00:54:43,475 --> 00:54:44,744
I hope they're okay.

750
00:54:45,945 --> 00:54:47,980
We just need to
stay safe tonight.

751
00:54:50,049 --> 00:54:52,351
I wonder what's in this book.

752
00:54:52,385 --> 00:54:53,352
I just wanna know why the hell

753
00:54:53,386 --> 00:54:56,022
she dug it up in
the first place.

754
00:54:56,055 --> 00:54:58,891
There's like
spells and chants.

755
00:54:59,825 --> 00:55:01,559
I found one for protection.

756
00:55:01,593 --> 00:55:03,396
Yo, close that book,
it's creeping me out.

757
00:55:03,428 --> 00:55:04,830
Wait till I get back
so that we can actually--

758
00:55:04,864 --> 00:55:06,799
Where you going?

759
00:55:06,832 --> 00:55:08,167
To get warmer sweats.

760
00:55:09,669 --> 00:55:11,170
I'll keep you warm.

761
00:55:11,203 --> 00:55:12,604
Yeah.

762
00:55:12,638 --> 00:55:14,740
That's exactly what
I was afraid of.

763
00:55:14,774 --> 00:55:16,409
What, no, I'm being serious.

764
00:55:17,542 --> 00:55:19,211
The group said we have
to stick together.

765
00:55:19,245 --> 00:55:20,413
Yeah.

766
00:55:20,445 --> 00:55:22,348
I'm gonna go get those,
I'll be right back.

767
00:55:23,515 --> 00:55:25,251
Wait, you guys,
listen to this.

768
00:55:26,852 --> 00:55:29,055
"Thrice around the circle bound,

769
00:55:29,088 --> 00:55:31,523
"all evil sinks into the ground.

770
00:55:31,556 --> 00:55:34,093
"By light of day
and darkness night,

771
00:55:34,126 --> 00:55:36,494
"I am protected by thee might.

772
00:55:36,528 --> 00:55:38,931
"Goddess of the moon and stars,

773
00:55:38,965 --> 00:55:41,334
"I call to thee
which tis me right,

774
00:55:41,367 --> 00:55:43,601
"protect me from
all evil's might.

775
00:55:58,784 --> 00:56:01,220
"Protected me from
all evil's harm.

776
00:56:01,253 --> 00:56:03,422
"Protect me from
all evil's might.

777
00:56:03,456 --> 00:56:05,157
"Protect me from
all evil's harm."

778
00:56:07,426 --> 00:56:08,627
Hey!

779
00:56:08,661 --> 00:56:09,494
You all right?

780
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,330
Yeah.

781
00:56:12,465 --> 00:56:14,532
Sounds like a
weird nursery rhyme.

782
00:56:14,566 --> 00:56:16,969
Why don't you put that
away and come here?

783
00:56:17,003 --> 00:56:19,739
I wouldn't be reading
those if I were you.

784
00:56:19,772 --> 00:56:21,240
You don't know what they are.

785
00:56:23,109 --> 00:56:23,943
Rachel?

786
00:56:29,648 --> 00:56:30,483
Rachel?

787
00:56:31,549 --> 00:56:34,020
Hey guys, come here.

788
00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:45,664
Michele, Michele.

789
00:56:45,698 --> 00:56:48,200
You're all right,
you're all right.

790
00:56:51,771 --> 00:56:53,806
Nate, watch my back.

791
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:54,673
Gotcha.

792
00:56:59,879 --> 00:57:01,714
Shit!

793
00:57:01,747 --> 00:57:03,916
Where the hell did she go?

794
00:57:06,385 --> 00:57:07,552
I don't know.

795
00:57:07,585 --> 00:57:08,954
We have to leave now.

796
00:57:10,856 --> 00:57:11,690
Shit!

797
00:57:13,591 --> 00:57:15,428
I so fucking hate her.

798
00:57:21,734 --> 00:57:23,135
Get her out of here!

799
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:06,979
- Ow!
- Are you okay? Are you okay?

800
00:58:07,012 --> 00:58:08,848
Yeah, I'm okay, I'm okay.

801
00:58:08,881 --> 00:58:11,250
Just put a little pressure
on it so you know you can walk.

802
00:58:11,283 --> 00:58:12,952
- All right, I got it.
- Ready?

803
00:58:12,985 --> 00:58:14,019
Yeah, let's go.

804
00:58:14,053 --> 00:58:15,121
Come on.

805
00:59:09,074 --> 00:59:10,309
- Nate! Nate!
- What? What?

806
00:59:10,342 --> 00:59:11,510
I can't run anymore.

807
00:59:11,544 --> 00:59:12,845
- I can't run anymore.
- What happened?

808
00:59:12,878 --> 00:59:14,346
My knee.

809
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:16,982
Okay, let's just get off the
trail and find cover, okay?

810
00:59:17,016 --> 00:59:17,850
Okay.

811
00:59:26,458 --> 00:59:28,761
Nate, Nate, seriously,
I can't go on.

812
00:59:28,794 --> 00:59:30,596
Okay, then let's
just relax, okay?

813
00:59:31,764 --> 00:59:32,831
I don't know what
the hell that was

814
00:59:32,865 --> 00:59:34,800
but that was not Sophia.

815
00:59:34,833 --> 00:59:36,535
Look, she looks
like she's possessed.

816
00:59:36,569 --> 00:59:39,071
I don't know what's
wrong with her!

817
00:59:39,104 --> 00:59:40,674
Crap, look, we just
need to get out of here

818
00:59:40,706 --> 00:59:42,308
as quick as possible, period.

819
00:59:47,513 --> 00:59:48,948
Go! Go! Go! Go!

820
01:00:20,246 --> 01:00:22,615
Protected me from
all evil's might.

821
01:00:22,649 --> 01:00:24,250
Protect me from all evil's harm.

822
01:00:25,417 --> 01:00:27,553
Protect me from
all evil's might.

823
01:00:27,586 --> 01:00:30,256
Protect me from all evil's harm.

824
01:00:57,016 --> 01:00:58,517
She's gone.

825
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:01,688
Yeah, I don't see her.

826
01:01:01,721 --> 01:01:02,554
Nate,

827
01:01:03,789 --> 01:01:05,157
my knee hurts so bad.

828
01:01:06,225 --> 01:01:07,426
You should just go.

829
01:01:07,459 --> 01:01:09,128
No, I'm not leaving you here.

830
01:01:10,529 --> 01:01:12,632
We stay here for the night
and leave at daylight.

831
01:01:14,033 --> 01:01:15,968
You're strong, I know you.

832
01:01:55,709 --> 01:01:56,842
Michele, we gotta move.

833
01:01:57,910 --> 01:01:59,478
I know.

834
01:01:59,511 --> 01:02:00,780
My knee's feeling just
a little bit better.

835
01:02:00,814 --> 01:02:02,281
It still hurts?

836
01:02:02,314 --> 01:02:03,148
Yeah.

837
01:02:08,854 --> 01:02:09,823
Try this.

838
01:02:09,855 --> 01:02:10,622
Okay.

839
01:02:10,657 --> 01:02:11,523
I think this will work.

840
01:02:11,557 --> 01:02:12,624
- It'll work?
- Yeah.

841
01:02:45,023 --> 01:02:45,859
Nate.

842
01:02:47,025 --> 01:02:48,661
What are we gonna
tell their moms?

843
01:02:50,229 --> 01:02:51,731
Travis' mom.

844
01:02:51,765 --> 01:02:54,667
All right, look, let's not
concentrate on that right now.

845
01:02:54,701 --> 01:02:56,969
Let's just concentrate
on getting out of here.

846
01:02:59,405 --> 01:03:00,172
Sorry.

847
01:03:00,205 --> 01:03:02,174
Hey, it's all right.

848
01:03:02,207 --> 01:03:03,041
Be strong.

849
01:03:04,677 --> 01:03:07,980
Take it one step
at a time, okay?

850
01:03:08,013 --> 01:03:09,114
There you go.

851
01:03:10,082 --> 01:03:12,050
We're almost there.

852
01:03:25,063 --> 01:03:27,132
- All right?
- Yeah.

853
01:03:28,934 --> 01:03:30,235
We made it.

854
01:03:30,269 --> 01:03:31,570
Please tell me
you have the keys.

855
01:03:31,603 --> 01:03:32,672
Yeah, I do.

856
01:03:37,176 --> 01:03:38,444
You stay here, okay?

857
01:04:10,743 --> 01:04:13,011
No, no, no.

858
01:04:17,851 --> 01:04:18,952
No, Nate, no.

859
01:04:20,085 --> 01:04:21,019
No, no, no.

860
01:04:22,922 --> 01:04:24,490
Sophia!

861
01:04:27,025 --> 01:04:28,761
Sophia, why?

862
01:04:28,795 --> 01:04:29,995
I'm Abigail.

863
01:04:30,028 --> 01:04:31,831
Sophia, it's me, Michele!

864
01:04:31,865 --> 01:04:33,432
Blood must be shed.

865
01:04:35,067 --> 01:04:36,401
But they're our
friends, Sophia.

866
01:04:36,435 --> 01:04:39,538
They were useless to me.

867
01:04:41,273 --> 01:04:43,308
You stay away from me.

868
01:04:43,342 --> 01:04:45,611
You stay away!

869
01:04:45,645 --> 01:04:46,646
That doesn't work.

870
01:04:49,649 --> 01:04:50,482
Ow!

871
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:53,151
Sophia, listen to me!

872
01:04:53,185 --> 01:04:54,219
Let me help you!

873
01:04:57,422 --> 01:04:59,157
Michele, oh my God, help me.

874
01:04:59,191 --> 01:05:00,793
Please help me.

875
01:05:00,827 --> 01:05:02,060
Sophia, what can I do?

876
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:06,131
Give me my book!

877
01:05:06,164 --> 01:05:08,534
And if I don't?

878
01:05:08,567 --> 01:05:11,905
You don't know
what you're doing.

879
01:05:11,938 --> 01:05:13,940
You think you can negotiate?

880
01:05:13,973 --> 01:05:17,242
One sure thing,
the book is mine!

881
01:05:17,276 --> 01:05:18,711
Abigail,

882
01:05:18,745 --> 01:05:21,146
let Sophia go!

883
01:05:21,179 --> 01:05:22,782
Too late now!

884
01:05:22,815 --> 01:05:23,850
She is gone!

885
01:05:25,117 --> 01:05:26,585
You crazy bitch!

886
01:05:30,890 --> 01:05:31,891
No!

887
01:05:37,931 --> 01:05:38,932
Hey!

888
01:05:38,965 --> 01:05:39,966
Leave her alone!

889
01:05:43,569 --> 01:05:44,403
Hey!

890
01:05:50,710 --> 01:05:51,543
Hey, you!

891
01:05:57,249 --> 01:06:00,787
And I don't remember
anything after that.

892
01:06:02,855 --> 01:06:03,690
Well,

893
01:06:05,457 --> 01:06:07,159
Michele, I think
that clears it up.

894
01:06:07,192 --> 01:06:10,162
The hunter corroborated
your story, however,

895
01:06:10,195 --> 01:06:13,198
we have yet to confirm the
perpetrator's identity.

896
01:06:13,231 --> 01:06:15,567
Detective, it's Sophia!

897
01:06:15,601 --> 01:06:17,804
Abigail possessed her,
why can't you believe me?

898
01:06:17,837 --> 01:06:19,072
Calm down, calm down.

899
01:06:19,104 --> 01:06:20,372
You need to get some
rest, all right?

900
01:06:20,405 --> 01:06:22,307
I'll have a transcript
made of this recording

901
01:06:22,341 --> 01:06:24,010
and we'll go from
there, all right?

902
01:06:24,043 --> 01:06:24,944
I promise.

903
01:06:26,411 --> 01:06:28,047
Did you guys find Jessica?

904
01:06:31,985 --> 01:06:32,819
We did.

905
01:06:36,990 --> 01:06:37,824
Is she?

906
01:06:39,291 --> 01:06:40,425
I'm afraid so.

907
01:06:40,459 --> 01:06:41,293
Michele?

908
01:06:42,527 --> 01:06:43,663
Time for your meds.

909
01:06:46,131 --> 01:06:48,367
Good afternoon,
Detective Henderson.

910
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,234
Judy.

911
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:52,371
Are you done?

912
01:06:54,941 --> 01:06:56,408
Actually, we're done.

913
01:06:56,441 --> 01:06:58,176
Take care, Michele, I'll be
in touch soon, all right?

914
01:06:58,210 --> 01:06:59,045
We'll talk.

915
01:07:02,982 --> 01:07:05,084
Detective, you're
not gonna find Sophia.

916
01:07:06,886 --> 01:07:08,353
Not unless she wants you to.

917
01:07:12,058 --> 01:07:12,992
I'll be in touch.

918
01:07:37,817 --> 01:07:39,819
Detective Henderson.

919
01:07:39,852 --> 01:07:42,487
Howard, how are you?

920
01:07:42,521 --> 01:07:44,757
Fascinating person,
this Abigail Barker.

921
01:07:46,291 --> 01:07:47,994
She was a real person then?

922
01:07:48,027 --> 01:07:49,028
Oh yeah, absolutely.

923
01:07:49,062 --> 01:07:52,031
She was born in 1670.

924
01:07:52,999 --> 01:07:54,399
What else can you tell me?

925
01:07:57,804 --> 01:07:58,871
Well,

926
01:07:58,905 --> 01:08:01,440
this Abigail Barker was

927
01:08:01,473 --> 01:08:04,911
put on trial in 1692

928
01:08:04,944 --> 01:08:08,114
and she was found
guilty of practicing

929
01:08:08,147 --> 01:08:10,883
acts of witchcraft by
the local magistrate.

930
01:08:10,917 --> 01:08:13,019
She was then tortured,

931
01:08:13,052 --> 01:08:16,089
which was standard
practice at the time,

932
01:08:16,122 --> 01:08:18,691
and then eventually executed.

933
01:08:18,725 --> 01:08:19,524
Really?

934
01:08:21,728 --> 01:08:23,629
Okay, wait a minute.

935
01:08:23,663 --> 01:08:25,732
How easy would it
be for my witness

936
01:08:25,765 --> 01:08:27,532
to have access to
that information?

937
01:08:29,836 --> 01:08:31,369
Well, anyone can research it,

938
01:08:31,403 --> 01:08:35,373
but I suppose "why"
would be my question

939
01:08:35,407 --> 01:08:36,241
and then,

940
01:08:37,609 --> 01:08:39,846
how would they even find
this book in the first place?

941
01:08:39,879 --> 01:08:41,613
Which, by the way,

942
01:08:41,647 --> 01:08:46,451
happens to be a compellation
of spells and incantations.

943
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:49,387
To tell you the truth, I as
hoping you were gonna tell me

944
01:08:49,421 --> 01:08:51,791
that Abigail Barker was
just a bunch of folklore

945
01:08:51,824 --> 01:08:53,592
and that book a
bunch of nonsense.

946
01:08:54,994 --> 01:08:58,631
Now I can get back to work
and get that book carbonated.

947
01:08:58,664 --> 01:09:00,032
What else do you got for me?

948
01:09:01,234 --> 01:09:02,702
Well, I don't know
if it's relevant at all

949
01:09:02,735 --> 01:09:04,904
but I also found
some documentation

950
01:09:04,937 --> 01:09:08,306
of accusations against
witches using amulets

951
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:11,343
to transform
themselves into animals

952
01:09:11,376 --> 01:09:14,080
and even powerful
creatures, supposedly.

953
01:09:14,113 --> 01:09:15,547
You've gotta be kidding me.

954
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:17,616
No, it was actually
documented multiple times

955
01:09:17,650 --> 01:09:18,818
during the witch trials.

956
01:09:20,086 --> 01:09:21,586
Well, that's about
all I have for now

957
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:25,158
but keep me posted on
what happens, okay?

958
01:09:25,191 --> 01:09:26,893
Most
definitely, thank you.

959
01:09:26,926 --> 01:09:27,927
All right.

960
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:28,795
Goodbye.

961
01:10:10,837 --> 01:10:12,872
Howard.

962
01:10:12,905 --> 01:10:13,973
Who is that?

963
01:10:15,473 --> 01:10:17,910
You know who this is.

964
01:10:17,944 --> 01:10:19,846
No, I don't know you.

965
01:10:20,780 --> 01:10:22,982
Oh, but you do.

966
01:10:23,015 --> 01:10:24,083
It's Abigail.

967
01:10:26,252 --> 01:10:27,086
No.

968
01:10:28,221 --> 01:10:29,889
That's not possible.

969
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:32,892
Aren't you a believer?

970
01:10:35,328 --> 01:10:36,595
Take a seat, Professor.

971
01:10:46,571 --> 01:10:47,572
I said, sit down!

972
01:10:50,877 --> 01:10:52,645
I don't understand.

973
01:10:52,678 --> 01:10:55,380
You're no different
than they were.

974
01:10:56,849 --> 01:10:59,185
It seems the professor has
been telling tall tales

975
01:10:59,218 --> 01:11:00,585
to Detective Henderson.

976
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:05,457
People love tall tales,
wouldn't you say?

977
01:11:06,359 --> 01:11:07,360
I suppose.

978
01:11:08,526 --> 01:11:11,898
When I was younger
I used art and spells

979
01:11:11,931 --> 01:11:13,299
to connect with nature.

980
01:11:14,734 --> 01:11:16,269
I only meant good back then.

981
01:11:17,937 --> 01:11:22,842
The folks people lied
and labeled me a witch!

982
01:11:22,875 --> 01:11:25,144
They did unspeakable
things to me!

983
01:11:26,544 --> 01:11:28,214
And I now you know the rest!

984
01:11:29,581 --> 01:11:32,018
But they couldn't destroy me.

985
01:11:33,953 --> 01:11:36,055
Because I choose darkness.

986
01:11:38,157 --> 01:11:38,991
My ally.

987
01:11:40,226 --> 01:11:42,228
We have just been
waiting to find someone

988
01:11:42,261 --> 01:11:44,130
to give me my vessel.

989
01:11:44,163 --> 01:11:45,364
The book of spells.

990
01:11:45,398 --> 01:11:48,334
Ah, you're a smart
man, Professor.

991
01:11:49,702 --> 01:11:51,503
So I'm sure you understand

992
01:11:54,073 --> 01:11:55,573
that until I find my book,

993
01:11:57,609 --> 01:12:00,246
I only need a little blood
sacrifice here and there.

994
01:12:11,757 --> 01:12:14,627
Professor, let's see what
dead flesh feels like.

995
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:35,613
Sleepy time.

996
01:12:53,598 --> 01:12:58,570
So Dr. Flanagan said that I
could go home in a day or two.

997
01:12:59,805 --> 01:13:01,640
Don't you think
it's a bit too soon?

998
01:13:02,808 --> 01:13:04,377
Why do you say that, Grandma?

999
01:13:05,277 --> 01:13:08,280
You're still having episodes.

1000
01:13:09,614 --> 01:13:11,250
The neighbors
are talking, huh?

1001
01:13:11,283 --> 01:13:13,618
You know I don't
care about that.

1002
01:13:13,652 --> 01:13:16,122
So then why do you have a
problem with me coming home?

1003
01:13:16,155 --> 01:13:17,056
I don't.

1004
01:13:19,458 --> 01:13:21,260
How's Travis' mom doing?

1005
01:13:23,262 --> 01:13:24,964
Well,

1006
01:13:24,997 --> 01:13:26,966
as well as can be
expected, you know.

1007
01:13:29,668 --> 01:13:30,936
They all blame me, huh?

1008
01:13:32,438 --> 01:13:35,341
Honey, until this thing
gets all sorted out,

1009
01:13:35,374 --> 01:13:36,608
people are gonna talk,

1010
01:13:36,642 --> 01:13:38,310
they're gonna come to
their own conclusions.

1011
01:13:38,344 --> 01:13:40,813
Yeah, well I'm a victim
in this too, Grandma!

1012
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:43,548
I know you are, sweetheart.

1013
01:13:46,218 --> 01:13:47,053
You know,

1014
01:13:48,487 --> 01:13:53,192
Sophia's parents have put up
a reward for her safe return.

1015
01:13:53,225 --> 01:13:55,261
She's not coming home!

1016
01:13:56,395 --> 01:13:57,595
She's dead!

1017
01:13:57,630 --> 01:13:58,864
I mean, how many times

1018
01:13:58,898 --> 01:14:00,766
do I have to keep
telling people this?

1019
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,302
Sophia is not Sophia anymore!

1020
01:14:04,804 --> 01:14:09,574
Sophia killed Travis, she killed
all of my friends, Grandma!

1021
01:14:09,607 --> 01:14:10,709
Oh, honey.

1022
01:14:11,844 --> 01:14:12,745
That's why I don't
want you to be

1023
01:14:12,778 --> 01:14:14,046
in such a hurry to come home.

1024
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,281
Grandma, I don't wanna stay

1025
01:14:15,314 --> 01:14:18,017
in this fucking
hospital anymore!

1026
01:14:18,050 --> 01:14:20,019
It's like a fucking
prison in here!

1027
01:14:20,052 --> 01:14:22,354
I miss all of my
friends' funerals.

1028
01:15:08,434 --> 01:15:10,236
Lieutenant.

1029
01:15:10,269 --> 01:15:11,303
What's up?

1030
01:15:39,398 --> 01:15:40,432
Hey, Nikki.

1031
01:15:40,466 --> 01:15:41,901
Detective.

1032
01:15:41,934 --> 01:15:44,537
Looks like Miles had a chance
to call 911 before he died,

1033
01:15:44,570 --> 01:15:48,040
so approximate time
of death, 9:10 PM.

1034
01:15:48,073 --> 01:15:49,775
He's got a single knife
wound to the chest,

1035
01:15:49,808 --> 01:15:51,744
was also stabbed in the hands.

1036
01:15:51,777 --> 01:15:54,313
There's some claw marks
in the back of his neck.

1037
01:15:54,346 --> 01:15:55,514
God.

1038
01:15:55,548 --> 01:15:57,016
How did they get in?

1039
01:15:57,049 --> 01:15:58,217
No sign of a break-in.

1040
01:15:58,250 --> 01:16:00,186
We had to pick the front
lock to gain access.

1041
01:16:00,219 --> 01:16:01,287
Locked from the inside.

1042
01:16:05,558 --> 01:16:06,759
What's this?

1043
01:16:06,792 --> 01:16:08,294
He wrote a name
with his blood.

1044
01:16:08,327 --> 01:16:09,929
Don't touch anything.

1045
01:16:09,962 --> 01:16:11,363
Forensics is on the way.

1046
01:16:13,265 --> 01:16:15,568
Okay, that's odd because Miles

1047
01:16:15,601 --> 01:16:18,470
was doing some research for
me on an Abigail Barker.

1048
01:16:18,504 --> 01:16:20,239
So we have a suspect?

1049
01:16:20,272 --> 01:16:22,541
Not exactly, the Abigail
Barker we're talking about

1050
01:16:22,575 --> 01:16:24,310
died in 1692.

1051
01:16:26,745 --> 01:16:28,814
I guess that was too easy.

1052
01:16:28,847 --> 01:16:30,749
Hey, what about that 911 call?

1053
01:16:30,783 --> 01:16:31,817
He only asked
for an ambulance.

1054
01:16:31,850 --> 01:16:33,786
The line went solid after that.

1055
01:16:33,819 --> 01:16:35,721
Okay, I'm gonna wanna
get a copy of that call.

1056
01:16:35,754 --> 01:16:38,591
I'll get you a copy
and put it in the folder.

1057
01:16:38,624 --> 01:16:40,526
Hey, how's that
Chadwick case coming?

1058
01:16:42,394 --> 01:16:45,064
Slowly, we're dealing
with a very fragile victim.

1059
01:16:45,097 --> 01:16:45,998
Victim?

1060
01:16:46,031 --> 01:16:47,667
Thought she was a suspect.

1061
01:16:47,701 --> 01:16:49,068
Another girl went missing

1062
01:16:50,236 --> 01:16:51,971
and right now she's
the only survivor.

1063
01:17:10,522 --> 01:17:11,725
Well,

1064
01:17:11,757 --> 01:17:13,959
physically, you're
in excellent shape.

1065
01:17:15,327 --> 01:17:16,795
Any pain?

1066
01:17:16,829 --> 01:17:17,631
Nope.

1067
01:17:18,698 --> 01:17:20,032
How about the nightmares?

1068
01:17:21,233 --> 01:17:24,203
Oh yeah, those haven't
come around in awhile.

1069
01:17:25,639 --> 01:17:26,572
Ready to go home?

1070
01:17:27,707 --> 01:17:29,174
Sure.

1071
01:17:29,208 --> 01:17:31,243
Well I'm gonna change
your medication a little bit

1072
01:17:31,277 --> 01:17:34,446
and if you have another
day without any incidents,

1073
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:35,848
you can go home.

1074
01:17:35,881 --> 01:17:36,982
Sounds good to me.

1075
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:41,253
Lower her dosage
to 25 milligrams

1076
01:17:41,287 --> 01:17:42,621
and let's keep an eye on her.

1077
01:17:42,656 --> 01:17:45,090
What about her
nighttime pills?

1078
01:17:45,124 --> 01:17:46,358
Just give me a
call in the afternoon

1079
01:17:46,392 --> 01:17:48,127
and we'll make a decision then.

1080
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:50,730
Dr. Flanagan, am I gonna
have to take these pills

1081
01:17:50,764 --> 01:17:52,298
once I go home?

1082
01:17:52,331 --> 01:17:55,267
Well, with this medication,
you can't quit cold turkey.

1083
01:17:55,301 --> 01:17:58,470
We have to decreased
your dosage gradually.

1084
01:17:58,504 --> 01:18:01,106
I want you to contact
your family physician

1085
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:02,474
in the next two days.

1086
01:18:03,743 --> 01:18:05,544
We'll send you home
with some instructions

1087
01:18:05,577 --> 01:18:07,846
and my notes to your doctor.

1088
01:18:09,315 --> 01:18:10,449
Okay, because I'm ready to go.

1089
01:18:10,482 --> 01:18:11,685
Yeah, I bet you are.

1090
01:18:26,932 --> 01:18:29,669
What do you got for me?

1091
01:18:29,703 --> 01:18:30,536
I got nothing.

1092
01:18:32,004 --> 01:18:33,539
I've dusted head to
toe several times.

1093
01:18:33,572 --> 01:18:35,742
I can't even find
a partial print.

1094
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:37,076
What about these
claw marks, here?

1095
01:18:37,109 --> 01:18:40,546
Any idea where they
would have come from?

1096
01:18:40,579 --> 01:18:42,147
They appear to

1097
01:18:43,349 --> 01:18:45,317
have been made by talons.

1098
01:18:45,351 --> 01:18:47,152
However, that's not
what killed him.

1099
01:18:47,186 --> 01:18:49,555
He died from a single
knife wound to the chest.

1100
01:18:50,757 --> 01:18:52,124
What about under
the fingernails?

1101
01:18:52,157 --> 01:18:53,660
Clean.

1102
01:18:53,693 --> 01:18:56,730
Whatever it was, the poor
guy didn't have a chance.

1103
01:19:00,767 --> 01:19:01,900
Hey there.

1104
01:19:01,934 --> 01:19:04,804
Hi, Beth, I'm
ready to go home now.

1105
01:19:04,838 --> 01:19:06,305
I bet.

1106
01:19:06,338 --> 01:19:09,041
I should hopefully have your
paperwork done within an hour.

1107
01:19:09,975 --> 01:19:10,777
You done with this?

1108
01:19:10,810 --> 01:19:12,411
Oh yeah, thank you.

1109
01:19:12,444 --> 01:19:14,346
Let me know if
there's anything else

1110
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:15,648
you need in the meantime.

1111
01:19:15,682 --> 01:19:20,687
I will.

1112
01:19:45,244 --> 01:19:46,912
What are you doing?

1113
01:19:46,945 --> 01:19:47,781
Stop!

1114
01:19:48,882 --> 01:19:50,416
Stop!

1115
01:19:50,449 --> 01:19:51,751
It'll feel good.

1116
01:19:51,785 --> 01:19:53,753
Somebody help me!

1117
01:19:53,787 --> 01:19:54,620
Help!

1118
01:19:56,455 --> 01:19:57,289
Help me!

1119
01:19:59,158 --> 01:20:01,193
Don't bother screaming,
no one can hear you talking.

1120
01:20:09,001 --> 01:20:11,003
It's so good to be home.

1121
01:20:12,304 --> 01:20:13,305
Come here.

1122
01:20:15,507 --> 01:20:18,343
Everything's gonna be
fine now that you're back.

1123
01:20:18,377 --> 01:20:19,545
Thank you, Grandma.

1124
01:20:19,578 --> 01:20:20,979
You're always so optimistic.

1125
01:20:25,451 --> 01:20:27,787
Why don't we order some pizza?

1126
01:20:27,821 --> 01:20:28,620
Sounds great.

1127
01:20:29,488 --> 01:20:30,322
Okay.

1128
01:21:17,704 --> 01:21:19,706
Excuse me, can I help you?

1129
01:21:19,739 --> 01:21:20,707
Where is she?

1130
01:21:20,740 --> 01:21:21,641
Excuse me?

1131
01:21:22,608 --> 01:21:23,710
That whore!

1132
01:21:24,878 --> 01:21:26,946
You need to leave right now.

1133
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:28,347
I don't think you heard me.

1134
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:31,550
I said, where is that
bitch of a whore?

1135
01:21:31,583 --> 01:21:32,551
You need to leave!

1136
01:21:36,388 --> 01:21:37,991
Where?

1137
01:21:40,092 --> 01:21:41,761
Where is she?

1138
01:21:41,794 --> 01:21:44,029
She's gone home.

1139
01:21:44,062 --> 01:21:44,998
Goodbye.

1140
01:21:48,968 --> 01:21:50,135
What's going on here?

1141
01:21:51,671 --> 01:21:52,939
Too late, Doctor.

1142
01:21:56,275 --> 01:21:57,476
What the hell are you?

1143
01:22:07,286 --> 01:22:08,688
Shoulda heeded my warning.

1144
01:22:13,927 --> 01:22:15,561
Hey, there's one more slice.

1145
01:22:15,594 --> 01:22:17,062
Oh no, I'm too full.

1146
01:22:17,095 --> 01:22:18,898
Oh, okay, you want more?

1147
01:22:18,932 --> 01:22:19,732
Sure.

1148
01:22:19,766 --> 01:22:21,366
Okay.

1149
01:22:22,234 --> 01:22:23,068
I'll get it.

1150
01:22:33,012 --> 01:22:33,913
Detective.

1151
01:22:33,947 --> 01:22:35,247
Mrs. Chadwick.

1152
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:36,683
What can I do for you?

1153
01:22:36,716 --> 01:22:38,150
Is Michele home?

1154
01:22:38,183 --> 01:22:39,018
Yes.

1155
01:22:40,185 --> 01:22:41,620
What's going on?

1156
01:22:41,654 --> 01:22:43,622
May I come in, I need
to speak with you both.

1157
01:22:43,656 --> 01:22:45,090
Sure.

1158
01:22:45,123 --> 01:22:45,959
Wait here.

1159
01:22:51,396 --> 01:22:53,231
Honey, it's the detective.

1160
01:22:55,367 --> 01:22:57,135
Michele, I'm gonna
get right to the point.

1161
01:22:57,169 --> 01:22:59,038
There's been a tragedy
at he hospital.

1162
01:23:00,006 --> 01:23:01,206
What happened?

1163
01:23:01,239 --> 01:23:03,776
This afternoon, Dr.
Flanagan, his main nurse

1164
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:06,045
and a security
guard were killed.

1165
01:23:06,079 --> 01:23:06,879
Oh my God.

1166
01:23:06,913 --> 01:23:08,347
It's Abigail!

1167
01:23:08,380 --> 01:23:10,850
Strangely enough, several
witnesses have confirmed

1168
01:23:10,883 --> 01:23:12,150
that the perpetrator's identity

1169
01:23:12,184 --> 01:23:13,753
does fit the
description of Sophia,

1170
01:23:13,786 --> 01:23:15,220
with the exception of her eyes.

1171
01:23:15,253 --> 01:23:18,290
No, it's Abigail, I
told you, she's coming!

1172
01:23:18,323 --> 01:23:21,193
I've got two officers
guarding your house

1173
01:23:21,226 --> 01:23:23,096
and in the morning they will
take you down to the station

1174
01:23:23,128 --> 01:23:24,329
to sign your statement.

1175
01:23:24,363 --> 01:23:26,431
It was Abigail, I
told you she's coming.

1176
01:23:26,465 --> 01:23:28,333
So you do think
we're in danger.

1177
01:23:28,367 --> 01:23:29,802
I'm not taking any chances.

1178
01:23:29,836 --> 01:23:32,504
I've got two officers guarding
the perimeter of your home

1179
01:23:32,537 --> 01:23:34,373
and I'm not leaving until
I know it's secured.

1180
01:23:55,594 --> 01:23:57,162
Mmmm.

1181
01:23:57,195 --> 01:23:58,698
Want me to fix you
something before you leave?

1182
01:23:58,731 --> 01:24:00,465
Oh no, I'm just
gonna get some coffee.

1183
01:24:00,499 --> 01:24:01,266
Okay.

1184
01:24:11,410 --> 01:24:12,812
Oh, Grandma, they're here.

1185
01:24:14,681 --> 01:24:15,948
So I'll see you later.

1186
01:24:15,982 --> 01:24:16,883
Good luck, baby.

1187
01:24:18,818 --> 01:24:20,419
Call me if you're gonna be late.

1188
01:24:21,586 --> 01:24:22,789
Okay.

1189
01:24:25,223 --> 01:24:26,258
Your ride is here.

1190
01:24:32,197 --> 01:24:33,866
Are you all right, miss?

1191
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:38,705
Yeah.

1192
01:24:40,238 --> 01:24:42,340
Just a little chest pain.

1193
01:24:42,374 --> 01:24:43,843
Okay, ready to go?

1194
01:24:43,876 --> 01:24:45,510
Yeah, let's do this.

1195
01:24:57,355 --> 01:25:02,260
We've got another room
down here we can check out.

1196
01:25:02,294 --> 01:25:03,696
Yeah, let's use this room.

1197
01:25:05,164 --> 01:25:06,632
There you are, I've been
looking all over for you.

1198
01:25:06,666 --> 01:25:07,599
What's up?

1199
01:25:07,633 --> 01:25:09,135
Stevenson found something.

1200
01:25:10,103 --> 01:25:11,503
What does he have?

1201
01:25:11,536 --> 01:25:14,439
Not sure but it sounded
extremely important.

1202
01:25:14,473 --> 01:25:16,408
I was just about to have
Michele repeat her statement.

1203
01:25:16,441 --> 01:25:18,610
I'll get it started for you.

1204
01:25:18,644 --> 01:25:19,578
You sure?

1205
01:25:19,611 --> 01:25:20,980
Yeah, I've got some time.

1206
01:25:21,013 --> 01:25:22,949
Michele, this is
Lieutenant Paxton,

1207
01:25:22,982 --> 01:25:24,449
he's going to review
your statement with you.

1208
01:25:24,483 --> 01:25:27,619
When you read it, make sure
you look over everything, okay?

1209
01:25:27,653 --> 01:25:28,553
Okay.

1210
01:25:28,587 --> 01:25:29,856
All right, I'll be right back.

1211
01:25:29,889 --> 01:25:31,389
Hey, young lady, shall we?

1212
01:25:35,494 --> 01:25:36,328
Have a seat.

1213
01:25:42,034 --> 01:25:42,869
Here you go.

1214
01:25:45,437 --> 01:25:47,039
Whoa.

1215
01:25:47,073 --> 01:25:49,208
Yeah, Henderson can
be pretty thorough.

1216
01:25:50,408 --> 01:25:52,511
Looks like you got a
lot of reading to do.

1217
01:25:53,980 --> 01:25:55,280
You need something to drink?

1218
01:25:55,313 --> 01:25:56,783
No, thank you.

1219
01:25:56,816 --> 01:25:58,751
Okay, go ahead and make
any corrections you need

1220
01:25:58,785 --> 01:26:01,220
and I will be right back.

1221
01:26:11,197 --> 01:26:12,999
I have something
you'll wanna see.

1222
01:26:14,734 --> 01:26:15,534
Take a look.

1223
01:26:15,567 --> 01:26:16,669
What is it?

1224
01:26:16,702 --> 01:26:18,104
It's the tip of the blade.

1225
01:26:19,105 --> 01:26:20,239
Is it gold?

1226
01:26:21,373 --> 01:26:22,574
No.

1227
01:26:22,607 --> 01:26:25,477
It's either a bronze
or a copper blend.

1228
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:26,378
Really?

1229
01:26:27,546 --> 01:26:29,548
I'll send it to a
metallist to confirm.

1230
01:26:29,581 --> 01:26:30,817
Any idea?

1231
01:26:30,850 --> 01:26:32,251
It's very old.

1232
01:26:32,285 --> 01:26:34,419
I don't have the equipment
to date it properly.

1233
01:26:53,072 --> 01:26:54,640
How are you doing?

1234
01:26:54,674 --> 01:26:56,876
I just finished.

1235
01:26:56,909 --> 01:26:58,510
Anything you'd like to change?

1236
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:01,113
No, everything
seems about right.

1237
01:27:02,281 --> 01:27:04,583
So this is not
an interrogation.

1238
01:27:04,616 --> 01:27:06,686
Just a couple things
I'd like to confirm.

1239
01:27:11,423 --> 01:27:14,260
Is this the knife you said
Brandon had in his possession?

1240
01:27:15,393 --> 01:27:16,229
Yes.

1241
01:27:20,432 --> 01:27:22,134
What about this book?

1242
01:27:25,872 --> 01:27:27,306
Yeah, that's the book.

1243
01:27:31,010 --> 01:27:32,178
Okay.

1244
01:27:32,211 --> 01:27:34,714
I just wanted to make
sure everything--

1245
01:27:34,747 --> 01:27:36,349
If you ask me...

1246
01:27:41,854 --> 01:27:43,656
I have no respect for authority.

1247
01:27:43,689 --> 01:27:45,358
Sophia, come on, it's me!

1248
01:27:45,390 --> 01:27:47,960
I'm Michele, I'm your friend!

1249
01:27:49,561 --> 01:27:51,130
Oh please, come on.

1250
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:52,899
Come on.

1251
01:28:20,525 --> 01:28:22,228
Sophia is dead.

1252
01:28:30,002 --> 01:28:31,938
I couldn't have killed you.

1253
01:28:31,971 --> 01:28:33,538
You were protected.

1254
01:28:34,506 --> 01:28:36,642
The book is mine.

1255
01:28:51,824 --> 01:28:52,658
Hey!

1256
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:55,227
Stop!

1257
01:29:12,845 --> 01:29:13,679
Oh my God!

1258
01:29:16,148 --> 01:29:18,550
I need am ambulance now!

1259
01:29:18,583 --> 01:29:19,418
Michele.

1260
01:29:20,853 --> 01:29:22,021
Oh my God.

1261
01:29:22,054 --> 01:29:22,888
Michele.

1262
01:29:27,293 --> 01:29:28,928
Michele, you're all right.

1263
01:29:28,961 --> 01:29:30,162
Sophia.

1264
01:29:30,196 --> 01:29:30,997
What?

1265
01:29:31,030 --> 01:29:32,231
Sophia.

1266
01:29:32,264 --> 01:29:33,632
You should just
save your strength.

1267
01:29:33,666 --> 01:29:36,135
I need help in here, now!

1268
01:29:57,957 --> 01:30:00,359
Can I get a ride?

1269
01:30:00,393 --> 01:30:01,394
Sure.

1270
01:30:01,427 --> 01:30:02,762
What's your name?

1271
01:30:02,795 --> 01:30:04,363
Abigail.

1272
01:31:06,826 --> 01:31:09,161
Reawaken.

1273
01:31:15,034 --> 01:31:20,039
♪ Reawaken
