The reign of terror continues.

192
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:16,034
The body of Elizabeth
 Richards, the 13th victim

193
00:18:16,034 --> 00:18:18,379
of the Video Stalker
 was found outside

194
00:18:18,379 --> 00:18:20,896
our Channel Six news
 building this morning.

195
00:18:20,896 --> 00:18:23,379
Inside sources reveal that
 she may have been shot

196
00:18:23,379 --> 00:18:24,655
by a stray bullet
 [tapping]

197
00:18:24,655 --> 00:18:27,724
from the gun of police
 officer Dakota Smith.

198
00:18:27,724 --> 00:18:30,068
A video cassette was
found on Richards' body

199
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,724
containing footage
 of intimate moments

200
00:18:31,724 --> 00:18:35,758
of lovemaking, phone
conversations and diary entries.

201
00:18:35,758 --> 00:18:38,000
The question on everybody's
 mind at this time is

202
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,551
how does he do it?

203
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:42,241
How does he invade the lives
 of his victims so completely

204
00:18:43,379 --> 00:18:45,344
and what can we do
 to protect ourselves?

205
00:18:46,551 --> 00:18:47,758
- [News Anchorman]
 Thank you, Julie.

206
00:18:47,758 --> 00:18:49,172
And we'll be back
 after these messages.

207
00:18:49,172 --> 00:18:51,827
- We're here to pick up Officer
Smith's personal effects.

208
00:18:51,827 --> 00:18:52,931
- For what?

209
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,931
- 'Cause he's a dead asshole.

210
00:18:54,931 --> 00:18:56,206
[faint uptempo music]

211
00:18:56,206 --> 00:18:57,034
Come on.

212
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,310
[knocking]

213
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,517
- [Dak] Yeah, it's open.

214
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,482
- Stinks in here.

215
00:19:18,965 --> 00:19:21,482
- They're lookin' all over
 the highway for your ass.

216
00:19:25,482 --> 00:19:26,931
Mahoney bet his watch commander

217
00:19:26,931 --> 00:19:28,827
he was shacked up
 with a case of beer.

218
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:34,827
Root beer.

219
00:19:35,724 --> 00:19:37,413
- Smells like you died in here.

220
00:19:38,551 --> 00:19:40,793
- He and Mahoney
 used to be partners.

221
00:19:40,793 --> 00:19:44,724
- And Mahoney is now chief
 detective and look at you.

222
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,000
- Fix you some coffee?

223
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:52,758
[chattering]

224
00:19:57,965 --> 00:20:00,586
- Do you wash your
 rubbers out, too?

225
00:20:00,586 --> 00:20:02,517
- Naw, your mama told
 me she was fixed.

226
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,931
- The van last night,
 the Video Stalker.

227
00:20:05,931 --> 00:20:07,758
- With number 13 inside.

228
00:20:07,758 --> 00:20:10,551
- First solid contact we
get with this guy ever

229
00:20:10,551 --> 00:20:12,896
and you don't call for back up,

230
00:20:12,896 --> 00:20:15,655
you do get off a shot
 and who do you hit?

231
00:20:15,655 --> 00:20:16,482
- The girl.

232
00:20:18,724 --> 00:20:20,068
Right in the forehead.

233
00:20:20,068 --> 00:20:21,310
Damn, you're good.

234
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,206
- What are you sayin'?

235
00:20:25,206 --> 00:20:26,448
What are you sayin'?

236
00:20:26,448 --> 00:20:28,620
- Ballistics matched
the bullet to your gun.

237
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,793
[tense uptempo music]

238
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:38,758
What is this?

239
00:20:40,862 --> 00:20:41,655
- Put that down.

240
00:20:42,931 --> 00:20:44,000
- I'm turnin' this in.

241
00:20:45,172 --> 00:20:47,620
Internal Affairs shoulda
had this weeks ago.

242
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,758
[groaning]

243
00:20:48,758 --> 00:20:49,517
- Let him go.

244
00:20:51,275 --> 00:20:52,827
[gun clicking]

245
00:20:52,827 --> 00:20:55,965
[uptempo tense music]

246
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:57,758
- Take the shot.

247
00:20:59,413 --> 00:21:03,689
[thudding]
 [grunting]

248
00:21:03,689 --> 00:21:05,862
Do you wanna play chicken?

249
00:21:06,827 --> 00:21:08,758
Next time you draw down on me,

250
00:21:08,758 --> 00:21:10,586
you better use that thing.

251
00:21:10,586 --> 00:21:12,689
[clicking]

252
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:15,862
[uptempo tense music]

253
00:21:20,137 --> 00:21:22,827
[door thudding]

254
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,000
[horn honking]

255
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,862
[traffic zooming]

256
00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:39,931
Excuse me.

257
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:42,310
Aren't you the new transfer
 they call Quick Draw McGraw?

258
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,862
- And you're Dirty Harry, right?

259
00:21:43,862 --> 00:21:44,827
[chuckling]

260
00:21:44,827 --> 00:21:46,827
- That's good, that's real good.

261
00:21:46,827 --> 00:21:48,862
You know, just for the record,

262
00:21:48,862 --> 00:21:51,241
if it was me, I'da
 done the same thing.

263
00:21:51,241 --> 00:21:53,620
- [Kristin] Yeah,
 but it wasn't you.

264
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,413
- Oh, come on.

265
00:21:55,344 --> 00:21:56,931
What's the big deal?

266
00:21:56,931 --> 00:21:58,827
So you shot the scum.

267
00:21:58,827 --> 00:22:00,896
People like that deserve
to be off the street.

268
00:22:11,172 --> 00:22:13,206
[phone ringing]

269
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,655
- Low profile?

270
00:22:16,517 --> 00:22:18,310
Lost a hundred bucks on you.

271
00:22:19,241 --> 00:22:20,068
- Amnesia.

272
00:22:22,034 --> 00:22:24,379
- Try this for your
 amnesia breath.

273
00:22:24,379 --> 00:22:27,000
- Nah, nah, nah, you got
 it wrong this time, coach.

274
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,103
I'm on a root beer diet.

275
00:22:28,103 --> 00:22:29,241
- Yeah?

276
00:22:29,241 --> 00:22:30,448
Your ex-wife called.

277
00:22:30,448 --> 00:22:31,620
She was lookin' for
 insurance money.

278
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,862
I told her we haven't
 got a body yet.

279
00:22:32,862 --> 00:22:34,482
She said see that,
 son of a bitch.

280
00:22:34,482 --> 00:22:36,241
Never there when you need him.

281
00:22:36,241 --> 00:22:37,137
- Why should I be?

282
00:22:43,413 --> 00:22:45,068
- You know I wanted
 you to know that I'm

283
00:22:45,068 --> 00:22:46,310
behind you on this.

284
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:48,793
It wasn't my idea to
 put ya out on patrol.

285
00:22:48,793 --> 00:22:50,586
[phone ringing]

286
00:22:50,586 --> 00:22:53,000
Internal Affairs decided
rather than suspend you

287
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,344
they'd put you on
 probation on my turf

288
00:22:56,344 --> 00:22:58,862
'til the incident's
 been investigated.

289
00:23:01,068 --> 00:23:03,137
- I understand.

290
00:23:03,137 --> 00:23:05,310
- Yeah, well you know how it is.

291
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,206
They have to investigate
why the victim

292
00:23:07,206 --> 00:23:09,482
had no gun on him
 when you shot him.

293
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,103
- I didn't know.

294
00:23:12,103 --> 00:23:14,896
He made a movement as though
 he was reaching for one.

295
00:23:14,896 --> 00:23:17,344
- Yeah, yeah, you're
 dismissed, Officer.

296
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,758
- I was sure

297
00:23:26,965 --> 00:23:27,827
he was dead.

298
00:23:28,827 --> 00:23:30,655
- He was my partner, I know him.

299
00:23:34,241 --> 00:23:35,689
- You don't know crap

300
00:23:35,689 --> 00:23:38,000
except how to save
 your own tail.

301
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,827
- You never let go, do ya?

302
00:23:39,827 --> 00:23:42,275
You came in late, you blew
 out your own kneecaps,

303
00:23:42,275 --> 00:23:44,379
you blame everybody else.

304
00:23:44,379 --> 00:23:45,689
- You let him take your piece.

305
00:23:45,689 --> 00:23:47,103
- And if you'd
 have taken a shot--

306
00:23:47,103 --> 00:23:48,620
- [Teak] All right, all right.

307
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,551
- [Dak] Screw you.

308
00:23:51,551 --> 00:23:53,517
- A drunk's response
 to everything.

309
00:23:55,137 --> 00:23:56,758
I want a report
 on that van stop.

310
00:23:59,241 --> 00:24:00,758
- You need my help on this one.

311
00:24:00,758 --> 00:24:02,034
- Call 9-1-1.

312
00:24:04,344 --> 00:24:06,620
[mumbling]

313
00:24:10,275 --> 00:24:11,655
- What is it with you two?

314
00:24:11,655 --> 00:24:13,310
- He's like a pit
 bull with a hard on.

315
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,551
- Never mess with
 a hard on, Mike.

316
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,965
- [Mike] We'll see.

317
00:24:18,931 --> 00:24:20,034
Get me that report.

318
00:24:21,758 --> 00:24:22,689
- Excuse me.

319
00:24:22,689 --> 00:24:24,310
Could you help me make a copy?

320
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,137
- Of what?

321
00:24:25,137 --> 00:24:26,000
- Your gun.

322
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,344
[laughing]

323
00:24:27,344 --> 00:24:30,000
- So, I hear they call
 ya Quick Draw McGraw.

324
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,931
So, what do you
 say, Quick's Draw?

325
00:24:31,931 --> 00:24:34,000
Let's you and me play
 a game of whip out.

326
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,206
Bet I can whip mine out
faster than you can.

327
00:24:36,206 --> 00:24:37,034
[thudding]
 [grunting]

328
00:24:37,034 --> 00:24:38,482
- Hey, wait a minute.

329
00:24:38,482 --> 00:24:39,413
- Ho, ho, chill out, chill out.

330
00:24:39,413 --> 00:24:40,931
Chill out.

331
00:24:40,931 --> 00:24:41,896
- [Mike] Hold it, hold it,
 hold it, that's enough.

332
00:24:41,896 --> 00:24:43,034
- But he didn't do anything.

333
00:24:43,034 --> 00:24:44,689
- All right, take it easy.

334
00:24:44,689 --> 00:24:46,310
- Johnson grabbed her
 ass, Bigelow offered
 to whip out cock.

335
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,758
- No, he didn't.
- All right.

336
00:24:47,758 --> 00:24:49,034
- [Detective] He
 didn't do anything.

337
00:24:49,034 --> 00:24:50,206
He didn't do a thing.

338
00:24:50,206 --> 00:24:51,413
He didn't do anything.

339
00:24:51,413 --> 00:24:53,482
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

340
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,241
Smith, Taylor, I
 wanna talk to you guys

341
00:24:58,241 --> 00:24:59,931
in my office right now.

342
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,413
- I guess a blow job's
 out of the question.

343
00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:16,724
[muffled yelling]

344
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,137
- [Detective] Bullshit!

345
00:25:18,137 --> 00:25:20,034
Fuckin' bullshit.

346
00:25:20,034 --> 00:25:22,551
[tense music]

347
00:25:27,586 --> 00:25:29,827
- [Video Stalker] Is
 Officer Dakota Smith around?

348
00:25:32,068 --> 00:25:32,931
Thank you.

349
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,517
- [Dak] Dr. Harley?

350
00:25:36,517 --> 00:25:39,000
[tense music]

351
00:25:41,413 --> 00:25:43,827
- I been expectin' your body.

352
00:25:46,241 --> 00:25:48,448
- Well, I'm sorry
 to disappoint you.

353
00:25:48,448 --> 00:25:50,000
- You all right?

354
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,275
- Maybe.

355
00:25:51,275 --> 00:25:53,344
Sometimes I'm not
 quite sure myself.

356
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:54,206
- Try meditation.

357
00:25:55,965 --> 00:25:58,413
Extensive cirrhosis
 of the liver.

358
00:25:58,413 --> 00:26:00,931
[tense music]

359
00:26:16,482 --> 00:26:17,310
- Damn.

360
00:26:19,206 --> 00:26:21,103
- You saved her from
 a horrible death.

361
00:26:23,586 --> 00:26:25,275
He likes plastic
 wrap on the face.

362
00:26:25,275 --> 00:26:27,034
They suck it in their
mouths, their nostrils,

363
00:26:27,034 --> 00:26:28,206
even their eye sockets,

364
00:26:29,931 --> 00:26:32,034
and rigor mortis sets in.

365
00:26:32,034 --> 00:26:34,551
[tense music]

366
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,758
- This liver, it's
 from drinkin'?

367
00:26:43,724 --> 00:26:44,551
- Mmm hmm.

368
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,482
[phone ringing]

369
00:26:50,482 --> 00:26:52,655
Would you get that for me?

370
00:26:58,206 --> 00:26:59,862
- Yeah, morgue.

371
00:26:59,862 --> 00:27:02,103
- [Video Stalker]
 Officer Smith, please.

372
00:27:02,103 --> 00:27:03,793
- Okay, you got him.

373
00:27:03,793 --> 00:27:05,862
- [Video Stalker] You
 really piss me off.

374
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,413
- Come on, come on,
 chill out, okay?

375
00:27:09,413 --> 00:27:10,344
I sent the check.

376
00:27:10,344 --> 00:27:12,620
It's in the mail, trust me.

377
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,103
- [Video Stalker] You don't
 know who this is, do you?

378
00:27:14,103 --> 00:27:15,241
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

379
00:27:15,241 --> 00:27:16,379
I know who it is.

380
00:27:16,379 --> 00:27:19,413
It's uh, my ex-wife's
 lawyer, right?

381
00:27:19,413 --> 00:27:21,034
- [Video Stalker]
 We met last night.

382
00:27:22,103 --> 00:27:24,068
You killed a
 passenger in my van.

383
00:27:24,068 --> 00:27:26,586
[tense music]

384
00:27:28,172 --> 00:27:29,517
- What do you want from me?

385
00:27:30,931 --> 00:27:32,965
- [Video Stalker] I'm
 gonna teach you humility.

386
00:27:34,448 --> 00:27:35,586
- Yeah, right.

387
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,827
How you gonna do that?

388
00:27:38,827 --> 00:27:40,068
- Trust me.

389
00:27:40,068 --> 00:27:42,586
[tense music]

390
00:27:44,862 --> 00:27:45,689
- Sure.

391
00:27:55,137 --> 00:27:56,000
- Dakota.

392
00:27:58,482 --> 00:27:59,310
Dakota Smith.

393
00:28:06,586 --> 00:28:07,517
- [Dak] Yo, what's up?

394
00:28:07,517 --> 00:28:09,586
- They found your 12-pack.

395
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,137
- Oh.

396
00:28:14,655 --> 00:28:15,482
Thanks, man.

397
00:28:15,482 --> 00:28:17,068
- [Newt] All right.

398
00:28:21,379 --> 00:28:23,827
- Hey look, [mumbling].

399
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,517
Come on man, I'm
 sorry, all right?

400
00:28:29,827 --> 00:28:31,310
- Sorry, sit down, Dak.

401
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:37,103
You know somethin', man?

402
00:28:37,103 --> 00:28:38,655
I really loved your father.

403
00:28:41,068 --> 00:28:43,172
And when you needed help,

404
00:28:43,172 --> 00:28:44,137
you came to me.

405
00:28:46,551 --> 00:28:49,000
But I'm tellin'
 you right now, man,

406
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,379
you break one more of my rules

407
00:28:51,379 --> 00:28:53,448
and you and your stuff
 are on the street.

408
00:28:54,517 --> 00:28:55,344
Deal?

409
00:28:58,241 --> 00:28:59,310
- Okay, all right.

410
00:29:01,137 --> 00:29:02,689
[tires screeching]

411
00:29:02,689 --> 00:29:03,586
- What is that?

412
00:29:05,586 --> 00:29:08,275
- These are tapes
 from the video store.

413
00:29:11,137 --> 00:29:13,413
- Hey, Newt, is that
you out there listenin'?

414
00:29:13,413 --> 00:29:14,344
- No, sir.

415
00:29:17,793 --> 00:29:21,103
- So tell me, have
 you got a sponsor?

416
00:29:24,103 --> 00:29:24,965
- No.

417
00:29:26,482 --> 00:29:27,310
- Well, then.

418
00:29:28,896 --> 00:29:31,310
How many sober days have
you strung together?

419
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:36,310
- 29.

420
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,344
- [Muscles] How many?

421
00:29:38,793 --> 00:29:40,103
- 16.

422
00:29:40,103 --> 00:29:41,758
- Come on, man.

423
00:29:41,758 --> 00:29:42,586
How many?

424
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,448
- Nine.

425
00:29:45,896 --> 00:29:46,724
- Right.

426
00:29:49,827 --> 00:29:50,655
So uh,

427
00:29:51,586 --> 00:29:52,448
how is your life?

428
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,448
- It's okay.

429
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,931
- Really?

430
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,551
And what have you got left?

431
00:30:01,551 --> 00:30:02,379
Your Harley?

432
00:30:05,241 --> 00:30:06,724
- Maybe.

433
00:30:06,724 --> 00:30:07,551
- Tell you what.

434
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:12,310
How 'bout one meeting
 a day for 90 days?

435
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,310
- A toothbrush?

436
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,275
I already brushed.

437
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:28,137
- Yeah, a few of them
 video tapes I heard

438
00:30:28,137 --> 00:30:30,413
been sold commercially
 in Europe,

439
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:32,275
and a few of them are
 right here on the streets.

440
00:30:32,275 --> 00:30:33,827
- Professional?

441
00:30:33,827 --> 00:30:35,379
- Naw.

442
00:30:35,379 --> 00:30:36,206
Poor quality.

443
00:30:36,206 --> 00:30:37,448
Copies of copies.

444
00:30:37,448 --> 00:30:38,655
But I know some
 guys that used to be

445
00:30:38,655 --> 00:30:39,620
in the porno business.

446
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,655
I could holler at them about it.

447
00:30:40,655 --> 00:30:42,275
- Well, that's good work, man.

448
00:30:42,275 --> 00:30:43,241
Get on it, all right.

449
00:30:43,241 --> 00:30:45,655
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Newt, Newt.

450
00:30:45,655 --> 00:30:47,172
My man, I need some help here.

451
00:30:47,172 --> 00:30:48,241
[laughing]

452
00:30:48,241 --> 00:30:49,103
- Call 9-1-1.

453
00:30:49,103 --> 00:30:50,000
I'm busy all right?

454
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,931
I'll holler at you.

455
00:30:50,931 --> 00:30:51,724
Cool.

456
00:30:59,931 --> 00:31:01,655
- [Julie] Is Officer
 Smith up here?

457
00:31:02,586 --> 00:31:04,034
- Yo.

458
00:31:04,034 --> 00:31:06,862
- [Julie] Officer Dakota
 Smith is a former detective.

459
00:31:06,862 --> 00:31:07,827
What are you doing?

460
00:31:09,137 --> 00:31:10,310
- Community service.

461
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,827
- It's a shitty job, but--

462
00:31:11,827 --> 00:31:13,551
- You stopped the
 stalker last night.

463
00:31:13,551 --> 00:31:14,827
He's probably watching.

464
00:31:14,827 --> 00:31:16,758
Is there anything
 you'd like to say?

465
00:31:16,758 --> 00:31:18,344
- Yeah, thanks for the call.

466
00:31:18,344 --> 00:31:19,896
- The Video Stalker called you?

467
00:31:21,034 --> 00:31:22,689
- Yeah, we have a
 common interest.

468
00:31:22,689 --> 00:31:23,689
- [Julie] Like what?

469
00:31:24,965 --> 00:31:25,793
- He's sick.

470
00:31:25,793 --> 00:31:27,275
He wants to die,

471
00:31:27,275 --> 00:31:29,551
and I'm gonna help him.

472
00:31:29,551 --> 00:31:31,620
[laughing]

473
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,896
- He's sick.

474
00:31:32,896 --> 00:31:35,379
[tense music]

475
00:31:41,413 --> 00:31:43,310
[knocking]

476
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,793
[tense music]

477
00:32:08,413 --> 00:32:10,827
There's a little
 surcharge on this job.

478
00:32:13,275 --> 00:32:14,517
- What are you talkin' about?

479
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:16,620
Garibaldi paid for this.

480
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,172
It's goin' with us.

481
00:32:18,172 --> 00:32:21,241
- Garibaldi doesn't have
 anything to do with this.

482
00:32:21,241 --> 00:32:23,517
This is a little
 something between us.

483
00:32:26,241 --> 00:32:27,551
- So, what are we talkin'?

484
00:32:29,517 --> 00:32:33,758
- This skid row cop, Dak,
 is on me like a pit bull.

485
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,793
He's almost as crazy as I am.

486
00:32:37,931 --> 00:32:40,241
I don't mind playin'
cat and mouse with him,

487
00:32:40,241 --> 00:32:44,000
but I think it's time
 to change the rules.

488
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,413
- So, you want us to off him?

489
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,758
- That would be too easy.

490
00:32:49,206 --> 00:32:52,137
I said I wanna change the
 rules, not end the game.

491
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:53,896
- Well, I'm not too
 much on games, so,

492
00:32:53,896 --> 00:32:55,310
just tell us what you want.

493
00:32:57,724 --> 00:33:00,344
- I want to make him suffer.

494
00:33:00,344 --> 00:33:03,965
[uptempo tense music]

495
00:33:03,965 --> 00:33:05,482
He has an overactive conscience,

496
00:33:05,482 --> 00:33:07,344
so work over one of his
buddies and tell him

497
00:33:07,344 --> 00:33:10,724
to tell his friend,
 his good friend, Dak,

498
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:15,862
that he better get outta
this while he still can.

499
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,310
Start with this guy.

500
00:33:24,413 --> 00:33:25,551
He owns a liquor store.

501
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,310
- You better know what
 you're talkin' about.

502
00:33:32,241 --> 00:33:35,413
[uptempo tense music]

503
00:33:48,965 --> 00:33:50,724
- This could be fun.

504
00:33:50,724 --> 00:33:54,931
- Be on the lookout for a
 dark van, military weapons.

505
00:33:54,931 --> 00:33:57,000
I know you already know
 this, but we need to find out

506
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,137
where he gets his info.

507
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,172
He somehow knows
 those little secrets

508
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:03,620
that people like to
 keep private, so,

509
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:07,241
if you happen to spot it, don't
be a hero like Smith, here.

510
00:34:07,241 --> 00:34:08,379
Call for backup.

511
00:34:09,413 --> 00:34:10,827
Good news, bad news.

512
00:34:10,827 --> 00:34:14,241
Good news, our new
 officer, Kristin O'Connor.

513
00:34:14,241 --> 00:34:17,620
Bad news, her partner
 will be Dakota Smith.

514
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,206
- What?

515
00:34:19,206 --> 00:34:20,482
- That's right.

516
00:34:20,482 --> 00:34:22,965
You're gonna be riding
 shotgun for O'Connor.

517
00:34:22,965 --> 00:34:25,344
- It's O'Connor who's
 gonna need a shotgun.

518
00:34:25,344 --> 00:34:26,620
[officers laughing]

519
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,931
- All right, that's it.

520
00:34:27,931 --> 00:34:30,275
Go out and do your jobs
and keep your radar

521
00:34:30,275 --> 00:34:32,344
turned on for that van.

522
00:34:32,344 --> 00:34:33,275
Dismissed.

523
00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:40,241
- Come on, man.

524
00:34:40,241 --> 00:34:41,931
What is this?

525
00:34:41,931 --> 00:34:43,206
What are you talking about?

526
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,965
I'm a cycle cop, I work alone.

527
00:34:45,965 --> 00:34:47,137
- Not anymore.

528
00:34:47,137 --> 00:34:48,517
I'm puttin' you in a patrol car.

529
00:34:48,517 --> 00:34:50,000
- [Dak] But I don't want
her, I don't need her.

530
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,827
- Dak, would you
 cut it out with that

531
00:34:51,827 --> 00:34:54,620
hurray for me and everybody
 else is an idiot attitude?

532
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,448
You do need her.

533
00:34:55,448 --> 00:34:56,689
I'm tellin' ya.

534
00:34:56,689 --> 00:34:58,413
Take it from a friend.

535
00:34:58,413 --> 00:34:59,620
She'll do you some good.

536
00:35:01,068 --> 00:35:02,241
- Yeah, right.

537
00:35:05,482 --> 00:35:08,310
[traffic zooming]

538
00:35:11,896 --> 00:35:14,000
- Happy birthday, yesterday.

539
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,448
[Dak chuckling]

540
00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:16,586
- Yeah, I've had a few.

541
00:35:18,103 --> 00:35:19,655
- You're younger than you look.

542
00:35:20,689 --> 00:35:21,862
It's probably the drinking.

543
00:35:21,862 --> 00:35:22,689
[Dak chuckling]

544
00:35:22,689 --> 00:35:24,103
- [Dak] What is this?

545
00:35:24,103 --> 00:35:26,827
You're my partner, now
 you're my psychiatrist, too?

546
00:35:26,827 --> 00:35:28,482
I mean, how do
 you know all this?

547
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,689
- I read your file.

548
00:35:31,827 --> 00:35:33,034
I got it out of the computer.

549
00:35:33,034 --> 00:35:35,620
It took half a box of
 paper to print out.

550
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:38,310
- Oh yeah, you mean you know

You work computers

kinda particular, right?

568
00:36:09,275 --> 00:36:10,103

00:37:39,344 --> 00:37:40,172
Ah, look.

597
00:37:41,517 --> 00:37:43,103
Look how scared she looks.

598
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:45,620
It's an act.

599
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,827
She wasn't scared when she was

600
00:37:46,827 --> 00:37:48,931
screwing around on her husband.

601
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:50,931
She really enjoyed it.

This must be her new husband.

Oh, no, wait a minute.

611
00:38:17,551 --> 00:38:19,620
I've seen her husband
 and that's not him.

 that guy from work.

of this stud before.

 he know this stuff?

615

 No wonder she said

616
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:30,482
her husband couldn't
 fulfill her needs.

617
00:38:31,931 --> 00:38:34,413
She said he really
 just needed a friend.

618

Oh, don't worry, Mr. Richards.

What about the cash?

646

 wanted more than that.

00:54:56,827 --> 00:54:58,413
Goddamn love sandwich.

915
00:54:59,965 --> 00:55:01,241
What's the note say?

916
00:55:01,241 --> 00:55:02,689
Sorry, Detective Dak.

917
00:55:04,413 --> 00:55:06,068
I lied.

918
00:55:06,068 --> 00:55:07,000
- This guy's sick.

919
00:55:08,655 --> 00:55:09,758
- So, what time is it?

920
00:55:10,827 --> 00:55:11,827
- It's 9:35.

921
00:55:13,379 --> 00:55:14,620
- Jesus Christ.

922
00:55:19,827 --> 00:55:22,413
- This is FBI Special
 Agent Coleman.

923
00:55:23,827 --> 00:55:25,137
He's been workin'
 with Mahoney here

924
00:55:25,137 --> 00:55:26,793
on the Video Stalker murders.

925
00:55:28,206 --> 00:55:29,724
- There's been no
 contact with this guy

926
00:55:29,724 --> 00:55:32,862
in over a year and a half,
 and now he's comin' out.

927
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:35,793
You really pissed him off when
 you shot that Richards lady.

928
00:55:35,793 --> 00:55:37,275
You destroyed his art.

929
00:55:37,275 --> 00:55:39,586
His fun and games are
 where he gets off.

930
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,275
- He wants to hurt you.

931
00:55:41,275 --> 00:55:43,000
There'll probably
 be more contact.

932
00:55:44,068 --> 00:55:45,862
- Which is why
 you're not suspended.

933
00:55:47,551 --> 00:55:49,620
- Yeah, but if I was
 still a detective...

934
00:55:52,172 --> 00:55:55,517
- No, you're most
 helpful where you are.

935
00:55:56,758 --> 00:55:58,103
He's probably watching you.

936
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:01,241
He has money.

937
00:56:01,241 --> 00:56:04,586
The latest in high-tech
 equipment, military weapons.

938
00:56:04,586 --> 00:56:06,344
He'll probably be
 coming after you.

939
00:56:08,413 --> 00:56:09,965
- Where does he get this money?

940
00:56:11,241 --> 00:56:13,344
- His videos are being
 distributed worldwide

941
00:56:13,344 --> 00:56:15,517
by a crime syndicate
 porn channel.

942
00:56:15,517 --> 00:56:17,000
- Why haven't you
 caught this guy?

943
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,517
- He's intelligent.

944
00:56:18,517 --> 00:56:20,931
Plus, he has mob
 resources behind him,

945
00:56:22,551 --> 00:56:24,275
and he's been real lucky.

946
00:56:24,275 --> 00:56:26,068
- Yeah, now that he's
 operating out of emotion--

947
00:56:26,068 --> 00:56:26,931
- He'll screw up

948
00:56:27,827 --> 00:56:29,310
and we'll be there to get him.

949
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:34,482
[phone ringing]

950
00:56:34,482 --> 00:56:35,310
- Well.

951
00:56:36,517 --> 00:56:39,758
You pissed off
everybody but the pope.

952
00:56:39,758 --> 00:56:41,586
We really don't know
how he feels about you,

953
00:56:41,586 --> 00:56:43,896
but watch your backs.

954
00:56:43,896 --> 00:56:45,620
- Well, I figure in a week,

955
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:47,965
I probably can find a way
 to piss the pope off, too.

956
00:56:47,965 --> 00:56:50,724
- Well, at this rate,
it won't take that long.

957
00:56:50,724 --> 00:56:52,275
Catch up with you later,
gotta make a phone call.

958
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:53,206
- See ya in the car.

959
00:56:58,275 --> 00:56:59,620
- Dakota.

960
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:00,896
- Dole.

961
00:57:00,896 --> 00:57:02,586
- May I have a word with
you outside, please?

962
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:03,413
- No problem.

963
00:57:05,275 --> 00:57:07,793
[tense music]

964
00:57:11,896 --> 00:57:13,103
So, what's up?

965
00:57:13,103 --> 00:57:14,482
- I'm keepin' a low
 profile on this case.

966
00:57:14,482 --> 00:57:15,482
You oughta try it sometimes.

967
00:57:15,482 --> 00:57:17,310
- Not my style, brother.

968
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:18,724
[siren blipping]

969
00:57:18,724 --> 00:57:20,103
Okay, so what's up?

970
00:57:21,034 --> 00:57:22,655
- All right, then.

971
00:57:22,655 --> 00:57:24,413
I'll come straight to the point.

972
00:57:24,413 --> 00:57:27,000
We've got a bad cop somewhere
 inside the department.

973
00:57:28,275 --> 00:57:29,275
- So who is it?

974
00:57:29,275 --> 00:57:31,000
- We don't know who.

975
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,724
Do you know a man named
Antonio Garibaldi?

976
00:57:34,758 --> 00:57:37,275
- Yeah, he's a crime boss,

977
00:57:37,275 --> 00:57:38,931
porno business, stuff like that.

978
00:57:38,931 --> 00:57:40,793
- Yeah well, we have
word that the stalker's

979
00:57:40,793 --> 00:57:43,344
snuff films are being
 distributed by Garibaldi.

980
00:57:44,931 --> 00:57:45,896
- Well, that's fine.

981
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:47,206
You FBI.

982
00:57:47,206 --> 00:57:48,620
Why don't you pick him up?

983
00:57:49,931 --> 00:57:50,724
- Well.

984
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:53,103
It's not just him we're after.

985
00:57:54,517 --> 00:57:57,034
He has a silent partner
 somewhere in your department.

986
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,034
- So what are you telling me?

987
00:58:01,034 --> 00:58:03,103
There's somebody in
 my department that's
 protecting him?

988
00:58:03,103 --> 00:58:07,758
- Protecting him, supplying
 him, informing him.

989
00:58:07,758 --> 00:58:09,172
He knows a hell of
 a lot more about us

990
00:58:09,172 --> 00:58:11,000
than we know about him.

991
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:11,862
- Jesus.

992
00:58:12,965 --> 00:58:14,517
So what are you
 laying this on me for?

993
00:58:16,448 --> 00:58:18,000
- Well, unless that
 flaming somersault

994
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,965
off the viaduct
 was an amazing act,

995
00:58:21,413 --> 00:58:23,448
I think you're a man
 that can be trusted.

996
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:26,793
- Yeah well, they say
that about me sometimes.

997
00:58:27,931 --> 00:58:29,793
- You find the bad seed

998
00:58:29,793 --> 00:58:31,655
and we'll bury him for ya,

999
00:58:31,655 --> 00:58:34,413
but in the meantime,
watch your back, Dakota.

1000
00:58:34,413 --> 00:58:35,965
There's someone
 inside your department

1001
00:58:35,965 --> 00:58:37,931
that doesn't want the
 stalker to get caught.

1002
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,586
- Yeah, not for long.

1003
00:58:41,586 --> 00:58:42,758
Thanks.

1004
00:58:42,758 --> 00:58:45,241
[tense music]

1005
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000

[phone ringing]

1007
00:59:01,517 --> 00:59:02,758
- Yes.

1008
00:59:02,758 --> 00:59:05,000
- You're getting off
 the track, my friend.

1009
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,172
- [Video Stalker
 On Phone] How so?

1010
00:59:06,172 --> 00:59:07,517
- Forget about
 this skid row cop.

1011
00:59:07,517 --> 00:59:08,758
We'll take care of him.

1012
00:59:08,758 --> 00:59:10,586
You just get to work
 on your next project.

1013
00:59:11,448 --> 00:59:12,413
- I am.

1014
00:59:12,413 --> 00:59:14,931
[tense music]

1015
00:59:27,655 --> 00:59:29,310
- [Man] So, you gonna ask me in?

1016
00:59:31,275 --> 00:59:33,172
- [Julie] I don't know.

1017
00:59:38,172 --> 00:59:40,413
[laughing]

1018
00:59:46,758 --> 00:59:49,275
- And he whisks her away.

1019
00:59:49,275 --> 00:59:51,517
[tense music]

1020
00:59:51,517 --> 00:59:54,275
- [Kristin] I don't
 think is a good idea.

1021
00:59:54,275 --> 00:59:56,172
- [Dak] Well, if we see
 anybody, we'll deal with it.

1022
00:59:56,172 --> 00:59:57,137
This stuff's too important.

1023
00:59:57,137 --> 00:59:58,827
We have to have it.

1024
00:59:58,827 --> 01:00:01,310
[tense music]

1025
01:00:22,965 --> 01:00:24,206
- Got it.

1026
01:00:24,206 --> 01:00:25,068
Gotta copy this.

1027
01:00:29,034 --> 01:00:31,724
[keys clacking]

1028
01:00:47,482 --> 01:00:48,793
[mumbling]

1029
01:00:48,793 --> 01:00:49,758
- No, there's one
 more thing I want

1030
01:00:49,758 --> 01:00:50,862
from the computer in here.

1031
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:02,551
Copy this, huh, and download
 all the stalker files.

1032
01:01:02,551 --> 01:01:05,034
[tense music]

1033
01:01:26,517 --> 01:01:27,689
- Get the disc from
 the other machine.

1034
01:01:27,689 --> 01:01:29,068
I'll finish here.

1035
01:01:29,068 --> 01:01:31,586
[tense music]

1036
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,137
Fuck, come on.

[whistling]

1038
01:02:11,172 --> 01:02:12,793
I was hoping that you'd show up.

1039
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
- Show up for what?

1040
01:02:16,172 --> 01:02:18,241
- Well, I just wanted
to personally apologize

1041
01:02:18,241 --> 01:02:20,344
for being on the wrong team.

1042
01:02:20,344 --> 01:02:22,310
They told me that you work late.

1043
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:23,931
- Do you wanna kiss and make up?

1044
01:02:25,586 --> 01:02:26,517
You know what?

1045
01:02:26,517 --> 01:02:28,000
You have been a bad girl.

1046
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,586
You know what else?

1047
01:02:29,586 --> 01:02:30,620
Talk is cheap.

1048
01:02:31,931 --> 01:02:33,793
- [Kristin] I walk
 the way I talk it.

1049
01:02:37,517 --> 01:02:39,206
- Do you like music?

1050
01:02:39,206 --> 01:02:40,620
- [Kristin] Very much.

1051
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:41,689
- Do you like to hum?

1052
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,551
- I'm an excellent hummer.

1053
01:02:45,965 --> 01:02:47,137
- Ooh, baby.

1054
01:02:49,896 --> 01:02:51,896
I'll bet you are an
 excellent hummer.

1055
01:02:55,862 --> 01:02:57,103
- Shit.

1056
01:02:57,103 --> 01:02:58,689
- Have you ever
 played the flute?

1057
01:02:58,689 --> 01:02:59,551
- Once or twice.

1058
01:03:00,482 --> 01:03:01,724
- What about the trombone?

1059
01:03:03,034 --> 01:03:05,034
- I've always
 admired the trombone.

1060
01:03:08,448 --> 01:03:10,103
- What about the slide trombone?

1061
01:03:11,206 --> 01:03:13,724
[tense music]

1062
01:03:39,655 --> 01:03:41,965
[smoke alarm blaring]

1063
01:03:41,965 --> 01:03:44,000
- Did you see his face
when the alarm went on?

1064
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,551
- You were gonna do it.

1065
01:03:45,551 --> 01:03:46,482
I don't believe it.

1066
01:03:46,482 --> 01:03:47,724
You actually were gonna do it.

1067
01:03:47,724 --> 01:03:49,275
- Well, you said
 whatever it takes.

1068
01:03:49,275 --> 01:03:50,241
- Wait, wait, wait.

1069
01:03:51,586 --> 01:03:52,517
The trombone.

1070
01:03:52,517 --> 01:03:54,137
Did you see the trombone?

1071
01:03:55,517 --> 01:03:56,344
- Whoo.

1072
01:04:00,482 --> 01:04:04,586
- A 12-digit number and
 the words First Bahamian.

1073
01:04:04,586 --> 01:04:05,827
- It's a bank.

1074
01:04:05,827 --> 01:04:07,275
It's gotta be an
 offshore account.

1075
01:04:08,724 --> 01:04:11,724
- What the hell would this
 guy need a foreign bank for?

1076
01:04:11,724 --> 01:04:12,655
- I'll call a computer
 buddy of mine.

1077
01:04:12,655 --> 01:04:15,310
Maybe we can access the account.

1078
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:16,137
- [Dak] Yeah.

1079
01:04:16,137 --> 01:04:17,758
- Here you go, Mommy.

1080
01:04:17,758 --> 01:04:19,413
- Thank you, sweetheart.

1081
01:04:19,413 --> 01:04:20,896
- Well, thank you.

1082
01:04:23,103 --> 01:04:24,896
Wow, fresh lemonade.

1083
01:04:24,896 --> 01:04:25,724
It's really great.

1084
01:04:25,724 --> 01:04:26,551
You make it?

1085
01:04:26,551 --> 01:04:27,379
- Yes.

[smooching]

1087
01:04:33,689 --> 01:04:34,827
- You know, she's
 the greatest thing

1088
01:04:34,827 --> 01:04:36,068
that ever happened to me.

1089
01:04:37,413 --> 01:04:40,068
Raising a child by
 yourself is so expensive.

1090
01:04:40,068 --> 01:04:41,931
Sure glad my mom's
 here to help out.

So, what do we got so far?

1098
01:05:00,827 --> 01:05:03,620
- Somebody, the serial killer,

1099
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:05,689
he chooses beautiful girls,

1100
01:05:05,689 --> 01:05:09,000

 and they're all

1101
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,620
having affairs with married men.

1102
01:05:11,931 --> 01:05:14,344
- And they all go to the
same Catholic church?

1103
01:05:14,344 --> 01:05:16,551
- The task force has
 people at every mass

1104
01:05:16,551 --> 01:05:19,689
and the FBI checked out all
 the priests, nuns, janitors.

1105
01:05:21,206 --> 01:05:22,137
- Are you Catholic?

1106
01:05:23,448 --> 01:05:24,517
- When I was a kid.

1107
01:05:26,482 --> 01:05:30,000
- So tell me this, if you
 wanted to choose a victim

1108
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
at a church, how
would you do it?

1109
01:05:34,793 --> 01:05:36,482

 wanted to know what

1110
01:05:36,482 --> 01:05:38,689

 in confessions.

1113

1114

1119
01:06:51,862 --> 01:06:52,689

1120
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:56,206

 for I have sinned.

1121
01:06:59,000 --> 01:06:59,827
- Yeah, right.

1122
01:07:02,413 --> 01:07:04,931

 since your last confession?

1123
01:07:07,965 --> 01:07:08,827
- Confession?

1124
01:07:10,448 --> 01:07:12,206
- [Priest] Just
 tell God your sins.

1125
01:07:15,379 --> 01:07:16,241

1126
01:07:17,206 --> 01:07:20,034

1128
01:07:26,827 --> 01:07:28,137
Is that a sin?

1129
01:07:28,137 --> 01:07:30,000

1130

1139
01:08:02,275 --> 01:08:04,413

1140
01:08:06,241 --> 01:08:07,586
- What in God's name?

1141
01:08:09,482 --> 01:08:11,724
- Well, I'm sorry
 Father, but I'm a cop

1142
01:08:11,724 --> 01:08:14,620
and the Video Stalker has been
 recording your confessions.

1143
01:08:21,448 --> 01:08:23,000

1147
01:08:27,137 --> 01:08:28,689
- [Julie] Officer Smith,
why don't you tell us

1148
01:08:28,689 --> 01:08:30,379
about your discovery?

1149
01:08:30,379 --> 01:08:32,620
- Well, as we were
 discussing earlier,

1150
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:36,793
we found this tiny camera
 and a transmitting device--

1151
01:08:36,793 --> 01:08:39,448
- [Video Stalker] Kris, they're
talking about the master.

1152
01:08:39,448 --> 01:08:42,206
- [Dak] Very popular
 Catholic church.

1153
01:08:42,206 --> 01:08:44,827
- Can you imagine
having your confession,

1154
01:08:44,827 --> 01:08:47,068
your face, on video tape?

1155
01:08:48,241 --> 01:08:50,379
- Yeah well, if
 he liked her looks

1156
01:08:50,379 --> 01:08:52,206
and if she confessed
 to adultery,

1157
01:08:52,206 --> 01:08:54,034
then he'd begin to stalk her.

1158
01:08:54,034 --> 01:08:56,931
- And when he was ready,
having edited his movie,

1159
01:08:56,931 --> 01:08:58,517
he would abduct her and--

1160
01:08:58,517 --> 01:09:02,793
- [Dak] Well, as far as we
 know, these tapes were being

1161
01:09:02,793 --> 01:09:03,896
bought and sold in Europe.

1162
01:09:03,896 --> 01:09:04,827
- [Video Stalker] Oh, Dak.

1163
01:09:04,827 --> 01:09:05,965
Can't you see she wants you?

1164
01:09:07,241 --> 01:09:08,172
Come on, man.

1165
01:09:08,172 --> 01:09:09,827
- Isn't that a bit unusual?

1166
01:09:09,827 --> 01:09:12,068
It doesn't fit the profile
 for a serial killer

1167
01:09:12,068 --> 01:09:14,137
to be profiting from his crimes.

1168
01:09:15,517 --> 01:09:18,827
- [Dak] Well, certainly that's
 more information than I,

1169
01:09:18,827 --> 01:09:20,689
I'd like to get
 into at this time.

1170

- Take this out to her.
