2
00:01:16,853 --> 00:01:18,118
Good morning.

3
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,253
It was.

4
00:01:19,255 --> 00:01:23,523
How people can take that corner
that fast is beyond me.

5
00:01:23,525 --> 00:01:24,994
It's maddening

6
00:01:27,562 --> 00:01:30,532
What you've done with your
grandmother's flowers...

7
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:32,434
She'd be so pleased.

8
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,004
Actually, these are for you.

9
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:40,375
Well, now that I'm here...

10
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,577
How was your date last night?

11
00:01:43,179 --> 00:01:44,746
It was good. I guess.

12
00:01:45,915 --> 00:01:50,619
When you meet the one, there'll
be no 'I guess' about it.

13
00:01:53,688 --> 00:01:55,124
Did you hear about the Meyers?

14
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:56,924
No. What happened?

15
00:01:56,926 --> 00:01:59,692
They're moving to a senior
residence.

16
00:01:59,694 --> 00:02:01,161
Oh, I don't know. Maybe it's for
the best.

17
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:03,696
I mean, that house is really big
for the two of them.

18
00:02:03,698 --> 00:02:06,035
I'm helping her back this
afternoon.

19
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:08,770
Well...

20
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:11,571
I'd better be on my way, let you
get back to your gardening.

21
00:02:11,573 --> 00:02:12,741
Almost done. Then off to work.

22
00:02:14,243 --> 00:02:17,577
Oh. Are we still on for our
power walk this afternoon?

23
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:19,213
Wouldn't miss our time together.

24
00:03:15,838 --> 00:03:18,040
Here you go. Extra hot and extra
sweet.

25
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:22,675
So finish telling me about your
date with Ken.

26
00:03:22,677 --> 00:03:24,144
Ron. Kenny was last week.

27
00:03:24,146 --> 00:03:25,147
Where'd you guys go?

28
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:26,280
The Waterfront Supper Club.

29
00:03:26,282 --> 00:03:27,482
Fancy.

30
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,851
It was.

31
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,820
I don't know. I feel like I'm
sort of stuck or something.

32
00:03:32,822 --> 00:03:34,021
Last night,

33
00:03:34,023 --> 00:03:35,990
Chris and I ate leftover mac and
cheese in front of the TV.

34
00:03:35,992 --> 00:03:37,259
I'd love to be your kind of
stuck.

35
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,294
I mean it's not like I don't
appreciate it. But...

36
00:03:40,296 --> 00:03:42,131
nice dinners aren't really
cutting it anymore.

37
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:44,198
Or maybe it's the company. I
don't know.

38
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,767
Do you think I should be more
social?

39
00:03:47,036 --> 00:03:48,302
You go out every night. How much
more social can you get?

40
00:03:48,304 --> 00:03:50,938
I don't know how to explain it
when I don't even get it myself.

41
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,975
Well, our church is having a
concert in a few weeks.

42
00:03:54,043 --> 00:03:55,744
You could come with. Meet some
new people.

43
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:58,644
Yeah, I'm not really a church
person.

44
00:03:58,646 --> 00:03:59,679
Think about it.

45
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:04,818
It's just a concert,
not a lifelong commitment.

46
00:04:09,358 --> 00:04:10,725
Let me guess.

47
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:12,862
Ron?

48
00:04:16,032 --> 00:04:16,964
Hey.

49
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:17,998
Hey.

50
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,601
They're beautiful.

51
00:04:20,836 --> 00:04:22,769
Can you get away for a sec?

52
00:04:22,771 --> 00:04:23,906
Yeah, sure.

53
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:25,839
Grab us a table?

54
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:26,842
All right.

55
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,580
Jason, I presume?!

56
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:35,382
You must be the pastor. Nice to
meet you in person.

57
00:04:35,384 --> 00:04:37,818
Saw you coming in, so I made you
a little welcome gift.

58
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,853
This is my signature latte.

59
00:04:39,855 --> 00:04:41,155
I appreciate Sun City Church

60
00:04:41,157 --> 00:04:43,157
taking Home Base Ministries
under their wing.

61
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,626
We're very happy to have you
here.

62
00:04:45,194 --> 00:04:46,994
I see you've met Pastor Matthew.

63
00:04:46,996 --> 00:04:48,929
Thank you so much for helping us
with the build.

64
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:51,764
Lord knows the need is great.

65
00:04:51,766 --> 00:04:53,102
You want to join me on a coffee
run?

66
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:55,903
Coffee? I just gave him coffee.

67
00:04:55,905 --> 00:04:57,938
No. You gave him bargain brand
mud.

68
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,873
Whatever. For the record...

69
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,842
The reason Chris wants to get
coffee

70
00:05:01,844 --> 00:05:03,743
is cuz he has a thing for
one of the baristas.

71
00:05:03,745 --> 00:05:06,949
We call that thing a marriage
license.

72
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,952
I wouldn't drink that.

73
00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:14,990
So, what's going on with you and
Rachel?

74
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:18,892
She's a major reason for my
moving up here.

75
00:05:18,894 --> 00:05:20,162
I figured as much.

76
00:05:21,931 --> 00:05:23,763
I don't have a lot of time,
so...

77
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:26,768
Well, hey, my CEO is hosting
this fundraiser.

78
00:05:27,436 --> 00:05:29,138
Would you please be my plus one?

79
00:05:29,972 --> 00:05:30,973
Definitely.

80
00:05:32,341 --> 00:05:34,740
Wait. When is it? Cuz I'll need
to get my hair done.

81
00:05:34,742 --> 00:05:35,976
Three weeks from Saturday at the
Freemont Hotel.

82
00:05:35,978 --> 00:05:38,744
Yes. I've actually always wanted
to...

83
00:05:39,448 --> 00:05:40,781
I got to get going.

84
00:05:40,783 --> 00:05:42,049
I'll call you.

85
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:43,383
Okay. Bye.

86
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,386
Bye.

87
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,796
Excuse me.

88
00:05:55,965 --> 00:05:57,099
Who's that guy with your man?

89
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,400
His old college buddy, and the
new director at Home Base.

90
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,301
How you doing?

91
00:06:01,303 --> 00:06:02,402
Good.

92
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,438
Here she is. My beautiful wife.

93
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,306
Shelby. Nice to meet you.

94
00:06:06,308 --> 00:06:07,309
You too.

95
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,309
Look, sorry I missed your
wedding.

96
00:06:09,311 --> 00:06:10,777
Hi! I'm Victoria, her favorite
co-worker.

97
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:11,780
Hey.

98
00:06:12,982 --> 00:06:14,014
How are you enjoying your first
day so far?

99
00:06:14,016 --> 00:06:14,948
So far, so good.

100
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,019
So, you see anything you like?

101
00:06:19,788 --> 00:06:20,589
Hmm.

102
00:06:21,957 --> 00:06:23,893
Oh, peanut butter mocha looks
great.

103
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:28,264
Ready for your first project?

104
00:06:28,998 --> 00:06:29,796
Babe. Let Jason get settled in
first.

105
00:06:29,798 --> 00:06:30,831
I'm just asking.

106
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:31,834
It's fine.

107
00:06:33,035 --> 00:06:34,301
Yeah, Chris has done a great
job at getting the word out.

108
00:06:34,303 --> 00:06:36,870
So we'll see how many show up
for the volunteer orientation.

109
00:06:36,872 --> 00:06:38,939
People have been picking up the
info cards.

110
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:39,942
Oh yeah?

111
00:06:41,043 --> 00:06:43,143
Even though social media
would've been the way to go.

112
00:06:43,145 --> 00:06:44,478
Everything helps.

113
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,048
Hot and sweet.

114
00:06:51,053 --> 00:06:52,054
We should go.

115
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:54,221
Bye.

116
00:06:54,223 --> 00:06:55,889
Glad to finally meet you.

117
00:06:55,891 --> 00:06:56,892
Nice meeting you.

118
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,902
Remember Ron? He literally just
brought you flowers.

119
00:07:07,836 --> 00:07:09,171
What's up with this Jason guy?

120
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:11,907
I'm guessing you're not his
type.

121
00:07:13,042 --> 00:07:17,311
Is he alive? Single? Then I can
be his type.

122
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:46,106
Hey. Can you watch the kids?
3:30 on Monday.

123
00:07:46,108 --> 00:07:48,041
Oh, sorry. I'm getting my hair
done.

124
00:07:48,043 --> 00:07:49,211
You can do that anytime.

125
00:07:50,312 --> 00:07:51,578
Well if I wait too long, people
will know it's fake.

126
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,381
Oh, people know.

127
00:07:53,983 --> 00:07:55,415
Okay, you're not helping your
case.

128
00:07:55,417 --> 00:07:56,952
Come on, sis. Please?

129
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,955
I guess my hair can wait.

130
00:08:00,456 --> 00:08:01,888
You can't be late.

131
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,092
Fine. I won't be late.

132
00:08:08,897 --> 00:08:10,931
So where are you going anyway?

133
00:08:10,933 --> 00:08:13,369
Oh, just an appointment.

134
00:08:17,973 --> 00:08:19,241
Are we keeping you from
something?

135
00:08:20,142 --> 00:08:20,841
Kind of.

136
00:08:20,843 --> 00:08:22,909
Another date to get ready for?

137
00:08:22,911 --> 00:08:24,444
Actually, it's a volunteer
thing.

138
00:08:24,446 --> 00:08:26,148
Volunteer? You?

139
00:08:27,082 --> 00:08:30,386
I can be a... volunteer person.

140
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,456
Oh, I get it. There's a guy. Is
your target a volunteer too?

141
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,925
You make me sound like I'm a
sniper.

142
00:08:38,927 --> 00:08:41,428
No, Jason, he organizes
the volunteers.

143
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:44,133
Oh, a guy with a purpose. I'm
impressed.

144
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:47,403
So what's the name of this
volunteer thing?

145
00:08:57,513 --> 00:08:59,381
Do you even own any tools?

146
00:09:00,182 --> 00:09:01,183
Why would I need tools?

147
00:09:02,284 --> 00:09:04,151
Jason's organization builds
houses.

148
00:09:04,153 --> 00:09:06,253
That's what you're volunteering
to do.

149
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:08,488
What? No, no, I can't build a
house.

150
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,590
You do this, and you're gonna
have to swing a hammer.

151
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:14,428
And you might chip a nail.

152
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,266
I think this is a Christian
organization.

153
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:21,968
Most likely he's a Christian if
he works for them,

154
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,005
which means he's probably not
gonna date someone who isn't.

155
00:09:25,007 --> 00:09:25,972
No. It won't be a problem.

156
00:09:25,974 --> 00:09:28,675
I'll just pretend. Fake it till
you make it.

157
00:09:28,677 --> 00:09:31,178
Vic, you can't fake faith.

158
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,512
Sure I can.

159
00:09:32,514 --> 00:09:34,448
I mean, do you remember when I
cheered for Seattle

160
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,383
at Nate's football party?

161
00:09:36,385 --> 00:09:38,685
I didn't know a thing about
football, but no one knew that.

162
00:09:38,687 --> 00:09:42,155
You brag about the weirdest
things.

163
00:09:42,157 --> 00:09:44,091
He's gonna figure it out
eventually.

164
00:09:44,093 --> 00:09:46,660
Yeah, but by then he'll be
totally into me.

165
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,933
Hey, Wyatt.

166
00:09:52,935 --> 00:09:54,069
Hey.

167
00:09:55,204 --> 00:09:56,303
Everything's ready to go.

168
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:57,306
Thanks, man.

169
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,941
You wanna wait a few?

170
00:10:00,509 --> 00:10:03,379
This is probably about all we
can expect. Let's get started.

171
00:10:04,346 --> 00:10:06,415
If I could have everyone have a
seat please.

172
00:10:13,222 --> 00:10:15,489
Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming
out.

173
00:10:15,491 --> 00:10:18,191
I appreciate your interest
in volunteering.

174
00:10:18,193 --> 00:10:22,398
My name is Jason Holman, and I'm
a... Uh...

175
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:26,268
The director of the new branch.

176
00:10:28,237 --> 00:10:31,538
Uh, how many of you are familiar
with what Home Blonde does...

177
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,242
Base? Home Base.

178
00:10:35,244 --> 00:10:40,213
Uh, we're a nonprofit
organization

179
00:10:40,215 --> 00:10:43,216
dedicated to helping families in
our local community.

180
00:10:43,218 --> 00:10:49,591
None of what we do is possible
without legs. Haha, and arms.

181
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,661
Gotta swing those hammers.

182
00:10:54,096 --> 00:10:56,363
Anyway, what I meant was...

183
00:10:56,365 --> 00:11:01,170
We can't do it without you all.
Our volunteers.

184
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:05,474
Thanks.

185
00:11:16,018 --> 00:11:17,319
Thanks.

186
00:11:22,257 --> 00:11:24,090
Your talk was great.

187
00:11:24,092 --> 00:11:26,628
Uh, okay. Thanks.

188
00:11:29,765 --> 00:11:31,567
Glad you were able to join us.

189
00:11:35,537 --> 00:11:37,339
So, how do you like your new
job?

190
00:11:38,106 --> 00:11:39,139
Yeah, so far, so good.

191
00:11:39,141 --> 00:11:40,407
I've lived here my whole life.

192
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:42,242
So if you ever need anyone to
show you around,

193
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:46,112
I'd be more than happy to. I'll
make myself available anytime.

194
00:11:46,114 --> 00:11:48,181
Are you free this Saturday?

195
00:11:48,183 --> 00:11:49,184
I am.

196
00:11:50,118 --> 00:11:50,417
If you want to write down your
number...

197
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:51,320
Yeah.

198
00:11:55,157 --> 00:11:56,189
You know, I...

199
00:11:56,191 --> 00:11:57,426
Are we about done here?

200
00:12:00,596 --> 00:12:02,062
We all good?

201
00:12:02,064 --> 00:12:05,701
Oh, umm yeah. All, all good.

202
00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:08,237
See you Saturday.

203
00:12:08,838 --> 00:12:10,339
Right.

204
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,343
I thought I'd come to the
rescue.

205
00:12:16,345 --> 00:12:18,211
She might be a handful.

206
00:12:18,213 --> 00:12:19,715
You think?

207
00:12:21,784 --> 00:12:23,352
Decent turnout.

208
00:12:24,186 --> 00:12:26,319
Half the people who sign up
actually show.

209
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:29,558
Well, we know at least one
person who'll be there.

210
00:12:30,827 --> 00:12:33,095
Yeah. We'll see.

211
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:50,270
Hey, morning.

212
00:13:50,272 --> 00:13:52,439
Hey. Megan, right?

213
00:13:52,441 --> 00:13:53,640
Yeah. Hey, I'm impressed with
the turnout.

214
00:13:53,642 --> 00:13:55,408
We ought to have the frame up in
no time.

215
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,710
I like your optimism.

216
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:58,712
I've done a lot of volunteer
building projects.

217
00:13:58,714 --> 00:14:01,281
Hey, if you need any help with
the newbies, just let me know.

218
00:14:01,283 --> 00:14:02,484
Thanks.

219
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:06,787
Hey, I know you left Cali to
start over,

220
00:14:06,789 --> 00:14:09,589
but don't be so focused on the
work.

221
00:14:09,591 --> 00:14:11,725
Be more open from moving on from
Rachel.

222
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:14,728
I don't get involved with people
who volunteer for me.

223
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,397
You know this.

224
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,900
Unless there's a wow factor.

225
00:14:19,902 --> 00:14:22,435
A what? No, that's...

226
00:14:22,437 --> 00:14:24,337
Like when you see someone from
across the room and

227
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:26,473
suddenly nothing else even
matters.

228
00:14:26,475 --> 00:14:27,741
That's ridicul...

229
00:14:40,522 --> 00:14:42,224
You were saying?

230
00:14:44,326 --> 00:14:45,795
Come on. We need to get started.

231
00:14:46,829 --> 00:14:48,829
You know, I don't know her that
well.

232
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,031
But by the way Shelby talks,

233
00:14:50,033 --> 00:14:55,502
I'd say she's more into hunting
guys than building homes.

234
00:14:55,504 --> 00:14:57,205
Doesn't mean she can't
volunteer.

235
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,775
Dude, I'm just saying be
careful.

236
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:03,443
Because she's clearly
into you.

237
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:07,683
Look, there's nothing I'd like
more than to meet someone.

238
00:15:08,818 --> 00:15:12,452
But volunteer or not, this girl
is way out of my league.

239
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:13,988
If what you say is true,

240
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,392
I don't need that kind of
complication in my life.

241
00:15:21,496 --> 00:15:23,732
Complication, nine o'clock.

242
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,701
Peanut butter mocha.

243
00:15:26,903 --> 00:15:29,436
Thanks. Were you planning on
working today

244
00:15:29,438 --> 00:15:30,637
or just bringing the coffee?

245
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,372
Oh, yes. Working, absolutely.

246
00:15:32,374 --> 00:15:33,808
I brought my own tools and
everything.

247
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:39,849
Yeah, no. Umm, hang on, please.
Use this one.

248
00:15:41,349 --> 00:15:42,850
You sure you're gonna be up for
this?

249
00:15:42,852 --> 00:15:43,853
Of course.

250
00:15:44,921 --> 00:15:45,585
Okay, great. Well, grab a hat.
Get your boots on.

251
00:15:45,587 --> 00:15:46,720
We're about to get started.

252
00:15:46,722 --> 00:15:51,593
Hey, Megan! Can you please help
out our new volunteer?

253
00:15:54,396 --> 00:15:56,398
Hey, you need some help?

254
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,802
Uh, hi. I'm Megan.

255
00:16:00,937 --> 00:16:03,638
Victoria. And yes, I would love
some help.

256
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,011
Where did you get yours? These
are so... so dirty.

257
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:12,647
Exactly why I bought my own.

258
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:15,751
Umm, here. This one's not too
bad.

259
00:16:26,394 --> 00:16:27,529
Hey, did you bring your vest?

260
00:16:28,563 --> 00:16:31,698
No. I've never built a house
before.

261
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,602
Oh, first time for everything.

262
00:16:34,336 --> 00:16:35,337
Do you want some grapes?

263
00:16:36,605 --> 00:16:38,505
Yeah, maybe later. After I wash
my hands.

264
00:16:38,507 --> 00:16:40,908
By the way, where does
one do that?

265
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,611
Bathroom's over there.

266
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:47,480
Okay. I'll be right back.

267
00:16:47,482 --> 00:16:48,715
I'm just gonna throw some things
in my car.

268
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:50,450
Oh, no, no, no. Toss it in here.

269
00:16:50,452 --> 00:16:52,787
Especially the jacket. You don't
want to get it dirty.

270
00:16:52,789 --> 00:16:55,722
It's too cute.

271
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:56,891
Is this yours?

272
00:16:56,893 --> 00:16:57,894
It is.

273
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,659
Hey, Wyatt.

274
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:00,995
Hi.

275
00:17:00,997 --> 00:17:02,430
Hey.

276
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:08,903
Right. Do you think you could
find an extra vest for Victoria?

277
00:17:08,905 --> 00:17:10,807
Yeah, sure.

278
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,976
Thank you for not making me look
like a complete idiot.

279
00:17:14,911 --> 00:17:17,144
No worries. I totally get it.

280
00:17:17,146 --> 00:17:19,479
So, if Jason doesn't have you
stationed anywhere,

281
00:17:19,481 --> 00:17:20,915
you can just stick with me.

282
00:17:20,917 --> 00:17:22,615
Trust me. I think he'd like
that.

283
00:17:22,617 --> 00:17:24,519
So, where do you go to church?

284
00:17:24,854 --> 00:17:26,521
Umm...

285
00:17:26,856 --> 00:17:27,654
Thank you.

286
00:17:27,656 --> 00:17:28,858
Thanks, Wyatt.

287
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,495
So, how do you know Wyatt?

288
00:17:34,462 --> 00:17:36,396
Oh, I've known him for like
forever.

289
00:17:36,398 --> 00:17:38,833
We go to the same church.

290
00:17:38,835 --> 00:17:39,836
He's cute.

291
00:17:41,003 --> 00:17:42,870
Oh my gosh, your earrings are
adorable.

292
00:17:42,872 --> 00:17:45,538
Uh, but they might get caught on
something,

293
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,609
so they'll have to go.

294
00:17:49,544 --> 00:17:53,415
Umm, please tell me you brought
boots.

295
00:17:54,784 --> 00:17:55,952
No.

296
00:18:00,089 --> 00:18:02,555
Lucky for you, my brother left
those in the car.

297
00:18:02,557 --> 00:18:04,593
Hey, everybody. Gather around.

298
00:18:09,764 --> 00:18:12,734
I always like to start a build
with a quick prayer.

299
00:18:17,772 --> 00:18:21,911
Father, we are grateful for
everyone here today.

300
00:18:23,012 --> 00:18:25,678
We ask your blessing upon this
build

301
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:32,820
and upon this home and
Yelena's family. Amen.

302
00:18:32,822 --> 00:18:33,990
Amen.

303
00:18:39,761 --> 00:18:41,763
So, have you swung a hammer
before?

304
00:18:42,064 --> 00:18:43,099
Nope.

305
00:18:43,765 --> 00:18:44,999
Hung a picture?

306
00:18:45,001 --> 00:18:46,466
No.

307
00:18:46,468 --> 00:18:47,904
Took wood shop class?

308
00:18:49,005 --> 00:18:50,006
No.

309
00:18:51,107 --> 00:18:53,606
Well, let's start with something
a little more simple

310
00:18:53,608 --> 00:18:57,677
like a window frame.

311
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,784
So we're just gonna take one of
these.

312
00:19:05,221 --> 00:19:07,622
Take this. Line it up.

313
00:19:10,993 --> 00:19:15,597
Okay. So now you're gonna take a
nail and hammer it right here.

314
00:19:19,668 --> 00:19:21,936
Yeah, that's good.

315
00:19:21,938 --> 00:19:22,939
Okay.

316
00:19:23,672 --> 00:19:25,571
You're gonna hammer it down.

317
00:19:25,573 --> 00:19:26,976
Oh. My hammer. Okay.

318
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,157
Oops. Sorry.

319
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:47,061
I see why there's a need for a
hard hat and boots now.

320
00:19:47,063 --> 00:19:51,999
Here. Maybe try holder the
hammer a little tighter.

321
00:19:52,001 --> 00:19:53,002
Okay.

322
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:56,738
We're not trying to send anyone
to the ER on the first day.

323
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,978
All it takes is a little
practice.

324
00:20:03,145 --> 00:20:04,612
Okay.

325
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:18,691
You gonna take that?

326
00:20:18,693 --> 00:20:20,863
No. Just a guy. He can wait.

327
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:25,567
So, do you have a boyfriend?

328
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:27,069
Nope.

329
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:29,939
Is there anyone you have your
eye on?

330
00:20:34,977 --> 00:20:36,143
How'd you know?

331
00:20:36,145 --> 00:20:37,945
Girl, it's so obvious.

332
00:20:37,947 --> 00:20:41,884
It doesn't even matter. We're
just friends.

333
00:20:43,786 --> 00:20:45,819
There's one thing I do know.

334
00:20:45,821 --> 00:20:48,956
It's that guys are not that
complicated.

335
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:51,093
He's had his eye on you all
morning.

336
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:54,028
If you teach me how to build a
house,

337
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:56,363
I'll teach you how to win
the guy.

338
00:20:56,365 --> 00:20:59,665
Okay, look.

339
00:20:59,667 --> 00:21:00,769
Start with this.

340
00:21:05,374 --> 00:21:06,942
What are you...

341
00:21:07,675 --> 00:21:08,676
Go ahead.

342
00:21:08,911 --> 00:21:09,777
Me?

343
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:12,714
Yes. Go ahead. Go.

344
00:21:32,634 --> 00:21:33,936
Go on.

345
00:21:40,776 --> 00:21:42,278
Okay.

346
00:21:44,046 --> 00:21:46,847
Try it like a little bit more
side to side.

347
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:51,852
Get the wind blowing in there.
You know what I mean?

348
00:21:51,854 --> 00:21:56,190
Okay. Then, you look at him like

349
00:21:56,192 --> 00:21:58,724
you're hanging onto every last
word.

350
00:21:58,726 --> 00:22:01,829
Then, you finish with the
fluttering of the lashes.

351
00:22:03,765 --> 00:22:06,033
I'm serious.

352
00:22:06,035 --> 00:22:08,904
Oh, also. This will grab his
attention.

353
00:22:09,939 --> 00:22:12,239
You carry this around with you
everywhere?

354
00:22:12,241 --> 00:22:14,110
Always got to be prepared. Here.

355
00:22:18,814 --> 00:22:19,849
Arms.

356
00:22:20,682 --> 00:22:22,118
Rub them together. Good.

357
00:22:24,253 --> 00:22:26,453
Oh. It's actually nice.

358
00:22:26,455 --> 00:22:29,225
Mm-hmm. Okay, so go on. Chat him
up.

359
00:22:31,227 --> 00:22:32,228
About what?

360
00:22:33,796 --> 00:22:35,264
I dunno. Ask him for a nail or
something.

361
00:22:39,268 --> 00:22:41,904
All it takes is a little
practice. Go.

362
00:22:52,781 --> 00:22:53,949
Hey.

363
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,351
Hey, Megan.

364
00:22:59,288 --> 00:23:01,989
Uh, hey, I was wondering... Are
you okay?

365
00:23:01,991 --> 00:23:03,957
Yeah, I'm fine.

366
00:23:17,907 --> 00:23:21,143
Perfume... Perfume.

367
00:23:23,745 --> 00:23:24,980
What happened?

368
00:23:25,881 --> 00:23:29,318
Apparently, he's allergic to the
perfume.

369
00:23:30,953 --> 00:23:33,155
Oops.

370
00:23:33,989 --> 00:23:36,025
I'm gonna check if he's okay.

371
00:24:03,052 --> 00:24:05,354
That was totally my fault. Sorry
about that.

372
00:24:07,323 --> 00:24:08,324
You doing okay?

373
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:11,894
Yeah. I'm pretty much one of
your top builders.

374
00:24:13,362 --> 00:24:16,398
Well, great job over there.

375
00:24:17,166 --> 00:24:19,368
That would be Megan's work.

376
00:24:20,369 --> 00:24:23,205
Actually, I could use a little
assistance.

377
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,211
Maybe don't choke up on the
handle.

378
00:24:45,394 --> 00:24:46,829
Give it a try.

379
00:24:52,368 --> 00:24:53,369
Ah.

380
00:24:57,406 --> 00:25:04,413
Uh, your hair... it's a hazard.
You should put it up.

381
00:25:54,463 --> 00:25:57,166
Three, two, one.

382
00:26:00,035 --> 00:26:00,667
Mom!

383
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:03,238
Hey! Hey.

384
00:26:04,106 --> 00:26:06,039
Look what we made for you.

385
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:10,145
Oh, honey. I love it.

386
00:26:14,683 --> 00:26:18,051
I smell dinner. Thanks for
getting it in the oven.

387
00:26:18,053 --> 00:26:19,054
Of course.

388
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:23,156
Are you staying?

389
00:26:23,158 --> 00:26:26,493
Unless of course you have a date
with the volunteer hottie.

390
00:26:26,495 --> 00:26:29,198
No. No date yet.

391
00:26:32,267 --> 00:26:33,533
Building a house is hard.

392
00:26:33,535 --> 00:26:36,238
Ya think? Have you met the
family yet?

393
00:26:37,172 --> 00:26:38,173
What family?

394
00:26:39,108 --> 00:26:40,376
Who you're building the house
for.

395
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:41,776
Oh. No, they weren't there.

396
00:26:41,778 --> 00:26:44,311
Weird, right? I mean you'd think
they'd be helping?

397
00:26:44,313 --> 00:26:48,048
Careful not to judge, sis. Oh,
we're only four tonight.

398
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:50,352
Oh, Mike's not gonna be home for
dinner?

399
00:26:51,019 --> 00:26:52,121
No.

400
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:59,493
So, did he buy your whole faith
act?

401
00:26:59,495 --> 00:27:01,094
I haven't even gotten that far
yet.

402
00:27:01,096 --> 00:27:02,429
It's like this guy's immune
or something.

403
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:04,498
I love you. But you can be so
vain.

404
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,699
Whatever.

405
00:27:05,701 --> 00:27:07,968
I mean it's not my fault this
guy's not like the others.

406
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:08,668
That's what I've been trying to
tell you.

407
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,203
Well, your'e right.

408
00:27:10,205 --> 00:27:11,972
I mean I don't even understand
what these Christian

409
00:27:11,974 --> 00:27:13,073
people are saying half the time.

410
00:27:13,075 --> 00:27:17,511
It's like they speak a
different....

411
00:27:17,513 --> 00:27:18,345
Wait.

412
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:18,514
What?

413
00:27:20,215 --> 00:27:22,616
Duh. If I want to play on his
field,

414
00:27:22,618 --> 00:27:24,184
I have to play by his rules.

415
00:27:24,186 --> 00:27:26,186
You've completely lost me.

416
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:29,558
I've gotta go. Bye. Love you.

417
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:43,999
Hey, Wyatt.

418
00:28:45,501 --> 00:28:49,571
Umm, I was just wondering. I was
just wondering... Umm.

419
00:28:50,472 --> 00:28:51,806
Can I help you with something?

420
00:28:51,808 --> 00:28:55,475
No. Yes. Yeah. Umm.

421
00:28:55,477 --> 00:29:00,282
Do you have a nail gun and some
nails?

422
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:09,191
Umm, I mean, well I just, umm.

423
00:29:12,427 --> 00:29:13,695
Do you have something in your
eye?

424
00:29:19,501 --> 00:29:21,167
What was that about?

425
00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:23,338
Yeah, don't ask me.

426
00:29:37,219 --> 00:29:40,720
Hi, I'm John Marcus. And welcome
back to our show.

427
00:29:40,722 --> 00:29:45,225
Framing your house is an
ambitious yet exciting project.

428
00:29:45,227 --> 00:29:46,894
And since the frame is the
skeleton

429
00:29:46,896 --> 00:29:48,595
or the backbone of your
house,

430
00:29:48,597 --> 00:29:52,299
supporting the entire
structure, you will need to use

431
00:29:52,301 --> 00:29:53,901
the proper tools and materials.

432
00:29:53,903 --> 00:29:57,838
The tools you will have to have
on hand are saw horses,

433
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:05,679
hand saws, power saws, chalk
lines, hammers, and nail guns.

434
00:30:32,407 --> 00:30:34,942
Hey, ladies. Natty here, from
Fantastic Wear.

435
00:30:34,944 --> 00:30:37,444
Tired of those frumpy drab work
clothes,

436
00:30:37,446 --> 00:30:39,179
tired of looking like just
another...

437
00:31:04,206 --> 00:31:05,641
I went shopping.

438
00:31:06,308 --> 00:31:07,674
I can see that.

439
00:31:07,676 --> 00:31:10,911
We got a lot done this morning.
Come on. I'll show you.

440
00:31:10,913 --> 00:31:12,815
Praise God!

441
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:19,354
So, how's it going with you know
who?

442
00:31:21,356 --> 00:31:22,391
Total fail.

443
00:31:23,325 --> 00:31:28,697
I'm sorry, Megan. Jesus loves
you.

444
00:31:29,531 --> 00:31:32,701
Well, yeah.

445
00:31:37,807 --> 00:31:39,840
Wyatt will have more for you
shortly.

446
00:31:39,842 --> 00:31:40,841
I'll go get it.

447
00:31:40,843 --> 00:31:41,844
Okay.

448
00:31:44,413 --> 00:31:45,714
So, I see you got the roof
sheeted.

449
00:31:46,949 --> 00:31:49,584
Uh-huh. I feel like we should
knock on wood or something.

450
00:31:50,953 --> 00:31:53,488
Oh. Be my guest.

451
00:31:56,826 --> 00:31:59,661
So, are we almost ready for
insulation and drywall then?

452
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,431
Almost.

453
00:32:03,365 --> 00:32:05,534
Well, what can I do while I wait
for Megan?

454
00:32:06,468 --> 00:32:10,336
Uh, you could flatten those
boxes if you want.

455
00:32:10,338 --> 00:32:12,807
I like to keep the work site
tidy.

456
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:13,810
Amen to that.

457
00:32:15,044 --> 00:32:17,343
I was wondering, do you guys do
your own heating, plumbing,

458
00:32:17,345 --> 00:32:21,281
and electrical yourselves? Or do
you hire an outside contractor?

459
00:32:21,283 --> 00:32:22,983
We'll bring in professionals for
that.

460
00:32:22,985 --> 00:32:24,718
A lot of them donate their time.

461
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,021
It's amazing that you guys can
actually build a house

462
00:32:27,023 --> 00:32:31,025
in such a short amount of time.
I don't know how you guys do it.

463
00:32:31,027 --> 00:32:34,527
My go to scripture is Matthew
nineteen twenty-six.

464
00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:35,395
Especially during a build.

465
00:32:35,397 --> 00:32:36,833
Mine too. My fave.

466
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:39,768
Are you hurt?

467
00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:41,871
I'm okay.

468
00:32:44,473 --> 00:32:45,741
Oh, I can get those.

469
00:32:57,753 --> 00:32:59,421
They're
coming.

470
00:33:01,456 --> 00:33:02,689
You sure you're okay?

471
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:03,757
Mm-hmm.

472
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:05,327
Okay. I'm gonna go greet them.

473
00:33:09,564 --> 00:33:11,733
Victoria, what happened?

474
00:33:12,701 --> 00:33:15,335
Sheesh. I left you for one
minute.

475
00:33:15,337 --> 00:33:16,404
I know.

476
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,778
Hey, guys. Come on. Do you want
to check out your new home?

477
00:33:22,044 --> 00:33:23,045
Hi.

478
00:33:24,113 --> 00:33:26,015
Everybody! Can I get your
attention for a minute?

479
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,021
Check it out.

480
00:33:32,721 --> 00:33:34,589
So they're gonna be here now?

481
00:33:35,357 --> 00:33:36,589
I heard she's required

482
00:33:36,591 --> 00:33:38,893
two hundred and fifty hours of
sweat equity.

483
00:33:38,895 --> 00:33:40,795
Umm, well, Elena's going to be
doing office work

484
00:33:40,797 --> 00:33:44,098
instead of building. She can't
exactly afford childcare.

485
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,366
Everyone, I'd like you to meet
the homeowners.

486
00:33:46,368 --> 00:33:50,137
This is Elena, Jordan, and
Kelsey.

487
00:33:50,139 --> 00:33:55,843
I am so grateful. As a single
mom working two jobs, it's...

488
00:33:55,845 --> 00:34:00,147
It's been a rough couple of
years.

489
00:34:01,918 --> 00:34:07,824
All of this... You wonderful
people building our home...

490
00:34:09,025 --> 00:34:12,829
There are no words to express
our thanks.

491
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:20,633
It's been a process. But I have
learned to give everything,

492
00:34:20,635 --> 00:34:23,672
all of my circumstances, over to
God.

493
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,875
So thank you all for being here
on our behalf.

494
00:34:27,877 --> 00:34:30,177
Thank you. Thanks.

495
00:35:30,006 --> 00:35:31,071
Hey.

496
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,809
I'm Victoria.

497
00:35:34,176 --> 00:35:35,744
Elena.

498
00:35:38,781 --> 00:35:41,648
I'm just imagining what it's
going to look like

499
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:42,985
when it's all done.

500
00:35:49,025 --> 00:35:50,725
Your girls are adorable.

501
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,997
They're my everything.

502
00:35:56,598 --> 00:35:58,498
I'm just happy

503
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,804
I'm going to be able to give
them a home after...

504
00:36:07,509 --> 00:36:11,981
Their father... He... He left.

505
00:36:13,049 --> 00:36:16,817
Been there. My parents divorced
when I was five.

506
00:36:16,819 --> 00:36:19,121
My mom raised me and my sister.

507
00:36:31,901 --> 00:36:37,039
You know, I always remind
myself...

508
00:36:38,606 --> 00:36:44,213
That God, he will never give me
more than I can handle.

509
00:36:46,548 --> 00:36:49,151
I mean, He provided you. Right?

510
00:36:49,986 --> 00:36:51,486
What do you mean?

511
00:36:52,687 --> 00:36:55,623
I asked God to provide a home
for us.

512
00:36:57,827 --> 00:37:00,327
And here you are. A total
stranger.

513
00:37:00,329 --> 00:37:06,802
Sacrificing your time to help
someone you don't even know.

514
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,274
I met the family today. Elena.

515
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:17,177
She has two little girls.
Reminds me so much of us.

516
00:37:17,179 --> 00:37:20,180
Yeah, mom being alone? Taking
two jobs?

517
00:37:20,182 --> 00:37:23,716
Totally. And like Elena, I mean
mom did her best.

518
00:37:23,718 --> 00:37:25,819
And I loved being with Grandma.

519
00:37:25,821 --> 00:37:26,989
Yeah, we had each other.

520
00:37:27,722 --> 00:37:28,723
Always.

521
00:37:29,825 --> 00:37:31,792
Hey, so there's something that
I...

522
00:37:31,794 --> 00:37:33,661
I can't believe I didn't see
this till now.

523
00:37:33,963 --> 00:37:34,964
See what?

524
00:37:36,232 --> 00:37:38,868
That's what Home Base Ministries
is about. People like Elena.

525
00:37:39,734 --> 00:37:41,904
I've just been getting in the
way.

526
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,370
Vic...

527
00:37:43,372 --> 00:37:44,972
I've been awful.

528
00:37:44,974 --> 00:37:46,774
Don't be so hard on yourself.

529
00:37:46,776 --> 00:37:48,142
So you don't think I've been
awful?

530
00:37:48,144 --> 00:37:50,676
Oh, no. You've been fairly
awful.

531
00:37:50,678 --> 00:37:54,181
But you realize it now.
That's the important thing.

532
00:37:54,183 --> 00:37:57,153
Now, use this new perspective
and go build a house.

533
00:37:57,887 --> 00:37:58,819
I will.

534
00:37:58,821 --> 00:38:01,687
I hear those kids who should be
sleeping.

535
00:38:01,689 --> 00:38:03,791
I gotta run, okay? Love you.

536
00:38:03,793 --> 00:38:04,860
Love you, too.

537
00:38:10,765 --> 00:38:13,002
Matthew something.

538
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:18,740
Hey, Zingle.

539
00:38:21,243 --> 00:38:23,145
What can I help you with?

540
00:38:25,713 --> 00:38:27,316
Matthew nineteen twenty-six.

541
00:38:28,217 --> 00:38:30,019
Matthew nineteen twenty-six.

542
00:38:31,287 --> 00:38:36,090
Jesus looked at them, and said,
"with man, this is impossible.

543
00:38:36,092 --> 00:38:39,093
But with God, all things are
possible."

544
00:38:53,275 --> 00:38:55,077
Oh, man.

545
00:39:06,422 --> 00:39:08,690
I was literally in the room like
five seconds before.

546
00:39:09,058 --> 00:39:10,690
All that matters is you're okay.

547
00:39:10,692 --> 00:39:12,059
I could've died.

548
00:39:12,061 --> 00:39:13,062
Well, you didn't.

549
00:39:13,761 --> 00:39:14,762
Yeah.

550
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,097
Well, thank you for letting me
stay here.

551
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:19,399
Sorry to move in on you and
Mike.

552
00:39:19,401 --> 00:39:21,203
That's what family is for.

553
00:39:22,004 --> 00:39:23,806
I'm gonna go brush my teeth.

554
00:39:36,252 --> 00:39:40,256
It's okay. Daddy's gonna come
home again.

555
00:39:49,365 --> 00:39:50,864
He met someone.

556
00:39:50,866 --> 00:39:52,868
Why didn't you tell me?

557
00:39:53,502 --> 00:39:55,202
I feel ashamed,

558
00:39:55,204 --> 00:39:58,972
like I didn't fight hard enough
for my marriage.

559
00:39:58,974 --> 00:40:01,143
It is not your fault.

560
00:40:02,811 --> 00:40:04,478
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

561
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,018
I have to find a way to support
us.

562
00:40:13,489 --> 00:40:14,588
You know,

563
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:16,756
God is never gonna give you more
than you can handle.

564
00:40:16,758 --> 00:40:17,991
Okay?

565
00:40:17,993 --> 00:40:19,328
Who are you?

566
00:40:22,764 --> 00:40:24,364
Look, I'm gonna be here for you.

567
00:40:24,366 --> 00:40:28,235
Just like you've always been
here for me.

568
00:42:09,972 --> 00:42:12,472
Your adornment must not be
merely external

569
00:42:12,474 --> 00:42:15,042
braiding the hair, and wearing
gold jewelry,

570
00:42:15,044 --> 00:42:16,977
or putting on dresses.

571
00:42:16,979 --> 00:42:19,246
But let it be the hidden person
of the heart,

572
00:42:19,248 --> 00:42:23,116
with the imperishable quality of
a gentle and quiet spirit,

573
00:42:23,118 --> 00:42:27,421
which is precious in the sight
of God.

574
00:42:59,188 --> 00:43:00,189
Hey.

575
00:43:00,556 --> 00:43:01,557
Hey.

576
00:43:02,191 --> 00:43:03,390
Haven't seen you in about a
week.

577
00:43:03,392 --> 00:43:04,991
You sure you're all right
from that fall?

578
00:43:04,993 --> 00:43:06,059
I mean, if you're injured...

579
00:43:06,061 --> 00:43:08,462
I'm okay. Promise. Not even
sore.

580
00:43:08,464 --> 00:43:09,965
Was it because of the flying
nails?

581
00:43:11,266 --> 00:43:13,133
Actually, my sister is going
through a rough time.

582
00:43:13,135 --> 00:43:16,069
And some crazy driver hit my
house instead of his breaks.

583
00:43:16,071 --> 00:43:18,171
So kind of a mess.

584
00:43:18,173 --> 00:43:20,542
Oh. I'm so sorry.

585
00:43:21,643 --> 00:43:23,078
How's Elena's house coming
along?

586
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:25,045
Yeah, it was going great, you
know

587
00:43:25,047 --> 00:43:26,713
until we got news that they're
getting kicked out

588
00:43:26,715 --> 00:43:29,416
of the place they're staying at
like a week early, so...

589
00:43:29,418 --> 00:43:32,352
Oh wow. Are you guys gonna
finish the house or...

590
00:43:32,354 --> 00:43:34,189
Not with our current number of
volunteers, no.

591
00:43:35,324 --> 00:43:37,157
Hey, I didn't mean to make you
feel bad.

592
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:38,325
I knew what you meant.

593
00:43:38,327 --> 00:43:39,328
Yeah.

594
00:43:41,964 --> 00:43:44,233
It's a good time for Matthew
nineteen twenty-six.

595
00:43:45,234 --> 00:43:49,403
For sure. Well, yeah I really

596
00:43:49,405 --> 00:43:52,539
just wanted to come by and make
sure you're okay.

597
00:43:52,541 --> 00:43:53,542
Thanks.

598
00:44:02,184 --> 00:44:03,252
Thank you.

599
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,995
I don't think we're gonna
finish.

600
00:44:14,263 --> 00:44:16,565
I'll go check, see how they're
doing at the back of the house.

601
00:44:25,407 --> 00:44:26,706
Well this is a surprise.

602
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:27,709
A nice one, I hope.

603
00:44:29,445 --> 00:44:30,377
Of course. I just thought you
weren't coming back.

604
00:44:30,379 --> 00:44:32,181
You need to finish this house.

605
00:44:33,148 --> 00:44:34,483
And you're here to help with
that?

606
00:44:36,118 --> 00:44:38,253
Hey. If you're not nice, I'll
send your new crew home.

607
00:44:38,554 --> 00:44:40,120
New crew?

608
00:45:07,249 --> 00:45:09,349
Wait. What's happening?

609
00:45:09,351 --> 00:45:11,186
You needed more volunteers.

610
00:45:14,523 --> 00:45:18,124
He is cute. Brownie?

611
00:45:18,126 --> 00:45:19,759
No, thanks.

612
00:47:05,334 --> 00:47:06,635
It's looking pretty good.

613
00:47:07,536 --> 00:47:09,738
One more thing. We're gonna need
a truck.

614
00:47:22,651 --> 00:47:24,184
You were amazing today.

615
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:27,554
Elena gets her house now because
of you.

616
00:47:27,556 --> 00:47:28,557
Hardly.

617
00:47:29,691 --> 00:47:33,259
I get that people are generous.
But you made it happen.

618
00:47:33,261 --> 00:47:36,698
The Meyers needed to downsize,
and Elena needed new furniture.

619
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,769
It felt good, though, to help
today.

620
00:47:41,904 --> 00:47:44,373
So, you want to see my totaled
house?

621
00:47:44,941 --> 00:47:48,408
Yeah.

622
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:51,647
Here we are. Home sweet home.

623
00:47:56,218 --> 00:47:57,419
Nice, huh?

624
00:48:00,656 --> 00:48:01,791
Wow.

625
00:48:02,758 --> 00:48:04,391
Yeah.

626
00:48:04,393 --> 00:48:05,759
I was actually on the couch
behind the wall,

627
00:48:05,761 --> 00:48:08,764
and I got up to get my notebook
in the other room.

628
00:48:10,867 --> 00:48:12,401
You were protected.

629
00:48:12,935 --> 00:48:14,670
What do you mean?

630
00:48:15,671 --> 00:48:17,739
God knew that guy was going to
drive into your house.

631
00:48:18,607 --> 00:48:20,308
Okay, could have been a
coincidence.

632
00:48:21,243 --> 00:48:23,443
I don't believe in coincidence.

633
00:48:23,445 --> 00:48:27,249
What I do believe is that he was
watching over you.

634
00:48:34,556 --> 00:48:37,390
I have ingredients for a mocha.

635
00:48:37,392 --> 00:48:40,460
Do you want to come inside or a
coffee?

636
00:48:40,462 --> 00:48:41,561
Yeah.

637
00:48:41,563 --> 00:48:42,764
Okay.

638
00:48:48,971 --> 00:48:50,840
I like old houses.

639
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:54,376
Good opportunity to make
improvements.

640
00:48:55,544 --> 00:48:57,510
Have you always lived here?

641
00:48:57,512 --> 00:49:00,348
No. It belonged to my grandma.
She kind-of raised us.

642
00:49:03,853 --> 00:49:06,486
My mom was single, worked a lot,
so...

643
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:08,555
What's your family situation
like?

644
00:49:08,557 --> 00:49:11,892
Parents are still married. I
have a brother.

645
00:49:11,894 --> 00:49:14,360
They all live in California.

646
00:49:14,362 --> 00:49:15,430
Oh, so why'd you move here?

647
00:49:17,033 --> 00:49:22,669
Mostly this job. They needed a
director. I was available.

648
00:49:22,671 --> 00:49:25,407
Mostly? Hmm.

649
00:49:27,509 --> 00:49:29,779
Why were you available?

650
00:49:32,547 --> 00:49:33,783
Come on.

651
00:49:34,549 --> 00:49:35,785
Really?

652
00:49:38,386 --> 00:49:43,891
Okay. I was in a relationship.

653
00:49:43,893 --> 00:49:44,894
The plot thickens.

654
00:49:46,428 --> 00:49:49,698
But my leaving was a good thing.
For both of us.

655
00:49:55,604 --> 00:49:57,706
Oh, so that's all you're gonna
tell me?

656
00:49:58,875 --> 00:49:59,909
Yep.

657
00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:03,345
You're kind of mysterious
sometimes.

658
00:50:04,446 --> 00:50:05,913
You're kind of a flirt
sometimes.

659
00:50:05,915 --> 00:50:06,713
Moi?

660
00:50:06,715 --> 00:50:07,716
Yeah.

661
00:50:12,687 --> 00:50:14,456
Her name's Rachel.

662
00:50:16,993 --> 00:50:18,861
We were engaged.

663
00:50:20,997 --> 00:50:22,495
It wasn't long before we
realized

664
00:50:22,497 --> 00:50:24,364
we wanted different things.

665
00:50:24,366 --> 00:50:25,767
Like what?

666
00:50:29,771 --> 00:50:34,609
I found faith. And she found a
reason to dump me.

667
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:39,782
So that was a deal breaker?

668
00:50:42,651 --> 00:50:44,751
I probably should get going.

669
00:50:44,753 --> 00:50:46,621
Oh. Okay.

670
00:50:52,895 --> 00:50:55,730
You know, I'm sort of new to
this whole faith thing.

671
00:50:56,165 --> 00:50:57,697
Yeah, I know.

672
00:50:57,699 --> 00:50:58,364
Oh.

673
00:50:58,366 --> 00:51:00,533
When I was offered the job,

674
00:51:00,535 --> 00:51:02,769
I'd only been going to church
for a couple of months.

675
00:51:02,771 --> 00:51:03,973
Oh, wow.

676
00:51:04,606 --> 00:51:05,607
What's that for?

677
00:51:06,608 --> 00:51:09,711
I don't know. I'm just trying to
figure you out.

678
00:51:10,612 --> 00:51:12,581
Yeah, I'm still trying to figure
me out.

679
00:51:13,515 --> 00:51:15,983
Believe me, I was trying to
belong,

680
00:51:15,985 --> 00:51:17,785
act like everyone around me.

681
00:51:17,787 --> 00:51:20,054
Total fake. I mean, who does
that?

682
00:51:20,056 --> 00:51:21,756
Yeah. Who does that?

683
00:51:22,959 --> 00:51:25,760
I finally settled into my own
relationship with God.

684
00:51:26,628 --> 00:51:29,799
And it turns out I don't have to
pretend with Him.

685
00:51:31,733 --> 00:51:35,604
Well, I gotta go watch Joy's
kids. So I'll see you around.

686
00:51:46,082 --> 00:51:47,083
Hey.

687
00:51:48,284 --> 00:51:51,921
Shelby keeps talking about some
concert. It's on Saturday.

688
00:51:53,089 --> 00:51:56,023
Would you possibly want to go
with me?

689
00:51:56,025 --> 00:51:58,460
Are you possibly asking me out
on a date?

690
00:51:59,095 --> 00:52:00,762
Depends on your answer.

691
00:52:01,563 --> 00:52:02,999
Yeah. I'd love to.

692
00:52:07,003 --> 00:52:08,703
So I'm cute, huh?

693
00:52:09,638 --> 00:52:12,172
Okay.

694
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,585
I can't believe I forgot about
my thing with him on Saturday.

695
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,487
Just go to the concert with
Jason.

696
00:52:26,621 --> 00:52:27,823
No, I can't blow off my date
with Ron.

697
00:52:29,091 --> 00:52:31,658
It's never bothered you before
to cancel for a better offer.

698
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:34,094
What's going on?

699
00:52:34,096 --> 00:52:35,595
I don't know.

700
00:52:35,597 --> 00:52:38,032
I feel like I don't even know
who I am anymore.

701
00:52:38,034 --> 00:52:40,702
Or maybe you're finally starting
to find out.

702
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:44,739
If there's a chance with Jason,
don't mess it up.

703
00:52:48,677 --> 00:52:51,814
Don't be afraid of a real
relationship.

704
00:54:11,127 --> 00:54:13,695
You're not yourself today. Is
everything okay?

705
00:54:22,071 --> 00:54:22,735
Hi, Shelby.

706
00:54:22,737 --> 00:54:24,238
Hi. Your usual?

707
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,075
Nah, just coffee today.

708
00:54:29,677 --> 00:54:31,914
Hey. Victoria?

709
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,613
Hey.

710
00:54:36,085 --> 00:54:37,319
Umm, do you want to grab a
table?

711
00:54:38,753 --> 00:54:39,987
Actually, I can't stay. I just
came to say hi.

712
00:54:39,989 --> 00:54:41,190
Hey, Victoria.

713
00:54:46,028 --> 00:54:48,563
Hi, Ron. You can grab coffee at
the other end with Shelby.

714
00:54:49,098 --> 00:54:50,933
I'm not here for coffee.

715
00:54:51,934 --> 00:54:53,903
Is he the reason you're avoiding
my phone calls?

716
00:54:55,171 --> 00:54:57,204
Look, I'm just hear to touch
base about...

717
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:04,744
Saturday's very important
to me.

718
00:55:04,746 --> 00:55:05,781
I know.

719
00:55:06,382 --> 00:55:07,883
I assume you'll be ready?

720
00:55:12,288 --> 00:55:15,057
These are for you. Replace the
others.

721
00:55:16,092 --> 00:55:17,126
Thank you.

722
00:55:18,194 --> 00:55:19,862
I'll see you Saturday?

723
00:55:49,859 --> 00:55:51,260
Jason! Hey!

724
00:55:52,461 --> 00:55:53,961
I forgot, okay? It was an honest
mistake.

725
00:55:53,963 --> 00:55:55,761
I was just so excited that you
asked me...

726
00:55:55,763 --> 00:55:56,866
I should've listed to Chris.

727
00:55:57,466 --> 00:55:58,968
Chris? What did Chris say?

728
00:55:59,935 --> 00:56:01,871
You really want to know? He
warned me off of you.

729
00:56:02,238 --> 00:56:04,238
That's not fair. Look, I wanted
to go out with you.

730
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:06,940
I've been trying to get you to
ask me out.

731
00:56:06,942 --> 00:56:09,011
Oh, so that's it? You got what
you wanted.

732
00:56:10,712 --> 00:56:11,780
I guess you won, huh?

733
00:56:12,281 --> 00:56:13,947
It's not like that.

734
00:56:13,949 --> 00:56:15,849
I double booked myself, and I
never do that.

735
00:56:15,851 --> 00:56:17,052
Do you hear yourself right now?

736
00:56:18,921 --> 00:56:21,123
I'm not into being strung along.

737
00:56:27,163 --> 00:56:29,098
Can you just wait a second?

738
00:56:32,468 --> 00:56:34,870
Fine. Tell me why you
volunteered.

739
00:56:42,478 --> 00:56:45,879
I volunteered because I wanted
to get to know you.

740
00:56:45,881 --> 00:56:49,216
And I wanted you to like me.

741
00:56:49,218 --> 00:56:53,755
So... I pretended to be a
Christian.

742
00:57:02,498 --> 00:57:05,365
Were you pretending to care when
I opened up about Rachel?

743
00:57:05,367 --> 00:57:07,069
Of course not.

744
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,042
Do me a favor. Just stay away.

745
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:33,796
What's up, bro?

746
00:57:34,496 --> 00:57:36,799
You were right about Victoria.

747
00:57:37,499 --> 00:57:40,002
Oh, man. I'm sorry.

748
00:57:55,918 --> 00:57:58,254
Hey. You gonna tell me what's
going on?

749
00:57:59,054 --> 00:58:00,055
About what?

750
00:58:01,056 --> 00:58:03,459
You've been avoiding Jason like
he's the plague.

751
00:58:04,893 --> 00:58:06,526
Look, we need to talk.

752
00:58:06,528 --> 00:58:08,297
Obviously.

753
00:58:10,099 --> 00:58:13,902
I haven't been completely honest
with you about who I am.

754
00:58:14,837 --> 00:58:16,171
I'm not really a Christian.

755
00:58:17,273 --> 00:58:19,406
Wait, then why would you tell me
you were?

756
00:58:19,408 --> 00:58:21,241
I dunno. It's complicated. But
mostly,

757
00:58:21,243 --> 00:58:23,977
when I got to know you guys, I
wanted you to like me.

758
00:58:23,979 --> 00:58:27,414
Victoria, if you want people to
like you,

759
00:58:27,416 --> 00:58:29,416
you let them get to know the
real you.

760
00:58:29,418 --> 00:58:31,820
I'm not trying to start
anything. I just...

761
00:58:32,921 --> 00:58:34,356
I can't believe I listened to
you.

762
00:58:35,557 --> 00:58:37,391
You had me trick Wyatt into
liking me,

763
00:58:37,393 --> 00:58:39,993
but that's not who I am.

764
00:58:39,995 --> 00:58:42,798
And now he thinks I'm just some
kind of weirdo.

765
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:46,266
And you know what, Christian or
not,

766
00:58:46,268 --> 00:58:48,103
I still would have been your
friend.

767
00:59:39,154 --> 00:59:41,922
Hey, there.

768
00:59:41,924 --> 00:59:43,192
Rachel.

769
00:59:43,992 --> 00:59:45,559
How did you know where...

770
00:59:45,561 --> 00:59:46,562
I called your mom.

771
00:59:47,696 --> 00:59:51,900
And I texted Chris a few times,
but he's, well, Chris.

772
00:59:53,068 --> 00:59:55,204
I don't think he likes me very
much.

773
01:00:04,313 --> 01:00:04,745
So this is what you've been
working on, huh?

774
01:00:11,687 --> 01:00:14,623
The whole flight up, I was
rehearsing what I was gonna say.

775
01:00:15,958 --> 01:00:18,460
Now that I look at you, I
just...

776
01:00:20,662 --> 01:00:22,431
I've missed you.

777
01:00:27,102 --> 01:00:28,103
Look, Rach...

778
01:00:29,004 --> 01:00:29,970
Jason, tell me you don't miss me
too.

779
01:00:29,972 --> 01:00:31,407
Of course I do.

780
01:00:33,675 --> 01:00:37,244
But we've been down this road.
We're different people.

781
01:00:37,246 --> 01:00:39,615
So we don't believe exactly the
same things. So what?

782
01:00:41,216 --> 01:00:44,219
My faith is the most important
part of who I am.

783
01:00:45,621 --> 01:00:46,753
It is who I am.

784
01:00:46,755 --> 01:00:48,455
I can go along with it.

785
01:00:48,457 --> 01:00:49,925
I don't want you to just go
along.

786
01:00:51,427 --> 01:00:53,929
I'm willing to do whatever it
takes. I just want you back.

787
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:55,697
That's not how faith works.

788
01:00:56,532 --> 01:00:58,400
You're not being fair.

789
01:00:59,535 --> 01:01:01,134
Sorry, Rach.

790
01:01:01,136 --> 01:01:06,275
Look. This is my room number.

791
01:01:08,076 --> 01:01:09,545
I'll be there until tomorrow.

792
01:01:20,589 --> 01:01:21,590
Please come.

793
01:01:46,181 --> 01:01:48,350
Jason. What are you still doing
here?

794
01:01:59,061 --> 01:02:00,562
You and Shelby...

795
01:02:03,298 --> 01:02:05,634
How do you guys make it work?

796
01:02:08,136 --> 01:02:12,007
It's just like you said. Work.

797
01:02:13,442 --> 01:02:15,477
We're both a couple of screw
ups.

798
01:02:16,478 --> 01:02:19,548
But each morning, we wake up and
we make a choice.

799
01:02:20,783 --> 01:02:23,685
To love each other. Prefer one
another.

800
01:02:25,187 --> 01:02:29,191
It's not always easy. But it's
real.

801
01:02:36,698 --> 01:02:38,200
Rachel came back.

802
01:02:42,504 --> 01:02:44,573
She's waiting for me to make a
choice.

803
01:02:48,210 --> 01:02:50,178
She's ready to make it work.

804
01:02:54,716 --> 01:02:56,285
What do you think?

805
01:03:04,359 --> 01:03:08,497
I dunno what to think. Not
anymore.

806
01:03:22,845 --> 01:03:24,212
I'll see ya.

807
01:03:28,851 --> 01:03:30,717
You look so pretty.

808
01:03:30,719 --> 01:03:31,852
Thank you.

809
01:03:31,854 --> 01:03:32,855
You sure about this?

810
01:03:34,489 --> 01:03:36,323
It's just easier to stick with
what I know.

811
01:03:36,325 --> 01:03:37,693
Then try to have fun. You
deserve it.

812
01:03:38,427 --> 01:03:39,227
Yeah. I don't.

813
01:03:40,395 --> 01:03:41,728
And tomorrow you have the house
reveal,

814
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:43,396
so that should cheer you up.

815
01:03:43,398 --> 01:03:45,400
You've worked hard. I'm proud of
you.

816
01:03:46,234 --> 01:03:48,168
I can't show my face there. I...

817
01:03:51,173 --> 01:03:52,441
I'll see you later tonight.

818
01:03:53,275 --> 01:03:54,343
Bye.

819
01:04:03,953 --> 01:04:06,254
I thought you were getting your
hair done for tonight.

820
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:08,889
Oh, umm, well I've just been
kind of busy with the whole...

821
01:04:08,891 --> 01:04:10,459
Whatever. Let's just go.

822
01:04:20,669 --> 01:04:24,172
Hey, Jonah! Don't forget golf
this time. It's next Thursday.

823
01:04:24,841 --> 01:04:26,306
I didn't know you liked golf.

824
01:04:26,308 --> 01:04:28,575
I hate it. But I need to stay on
his radar.

825
01:04:28,577 --> 01:04:30,746
You shouldn't have to pretend to
like golf.

826
01:04:52,768 --> 01:04:55,637
That's my boss. I can't wait for
him to meet you.

827
01:04:56,939 --> 01:04:57,940
Ron, my man.

828
01:04:59,441 --> 01:05:01,408
I hear you landed the Ginsburg
account for us.

829
01:05:01,410 --> 01:05:02,409
That is nice work.

830
01:05:02,411 --> 01:05:05,345
Well Ginsburg is a Harvard man.
Just like me.

831
01:05:05,347 --> 01:05:06,479
That is well played.

832
01:05:06,481 --> 01:05:08,684
This is my girlfriend, Victoria.

833
01:05:10,652 --> 01:05:11,653
Hello,

834
01:05:11,854 --> 01:05:12,855
Hi.

835
01:05:13,790 --> 01:05:15,488
You two enjoy yourselves.

836
01:05:15,490 --> 01:05:21,361
There is great shrimp at the
buffet. Save me two.

837
01:05:21,363 --> 01:05:22,564
Girlfriend?

838
01:05:23,465 --> 01:05:26,268
Just roll with it for tonight,
okay? Please?

839
01:05:26,635 --> 01:05:27,636
Fine.

840
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:37,546
Harvard? I didn't know you went
there.

841
01:05:37,847 --> 01:05:38,979
I didn't.

842
01:05:38,981 --> 01:05:39,982
Hmm.

843
01:05:41,717 --> 01:05:43,820
It's business. You tell people
what they want to hear.

844
01:06:59,728 --> 01:07:01,561
There you are. Come on. I want
to show you off to David...

845
01:07:01,563 --> 01:07:04,631
Ron... This is not what I want
anymore.

846
01:07:04,633 --> 01:07:05,598
Excuse me?

847
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,870
I'm not your arm candy.

848
01:07:08,637 --> 01:07:10,537
Why are you being so difficult?

849
01:07:10,539 --> 01:07:13,073
I need to people in my life who
are honest

850
01:07:13,075 --> 01:07:15,575
and expect the same from me.

851
01:07:15,577 --> 01:07:16,879
I don't understand.

852
01:07:17,579 --> 01:07:21,583
I'm just realizing this all now.

853
01:07:31,928 --> 01:07:32,759
Come on!

854
01:08:03,425 --> 01:08:04,927
Continue on for five miles.

855
01:08:06,195 --> 01:08:07,694
I know we're just getting to
know each other,

856
01:08:07,696 --> 01:08:10,697
but please let this be the right
thing to do.

857
01:08:21,911 --> 01:08:23,712
You guys are awesome!

858
01:08:39,561 --> 01:08:41,763
Your destination is on the left.

859
01:08:58,014 --> 01:08:59,048
Oh, thank you.

860
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:13,829
No umbrella. Just great.

861
01:09:16,032 --> 01:09:18,733
If only I had those ugly boots
now.

862
01:09:24,807 --> 01:09:26,675
Ugh, you're not gonna make this
easy, are you?

863
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,615
Thank you! Good night!

864
01:09:41,190 --> 01:09:43,891
Hey, hey, everybody! Weren't
they amazing?

865
01:09:45,127 --> 01:09:46,961
We come to my favorite time of
this evening,

866
01:09:46,963 --> 01:09:49,729
especially after that
performance.

867
01:09:49,731 --> 01:09:51,764
And I don't want to miss an
opportunity

868
01:09:51,766 --> 01:09:56,804
to celebrate with anyone who's
accepted Jesus tonight.

869
01:10:05,915 --> 01:10:08,715
So, who's brave enough to come
on up here

870
01:10:08,717 --> 01:10:12,618
and share about it? Share their
testimony.

871
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:14,656
Yeah, come on up, young lady.

872
01:10:15,623 --> 01:10:17,257
What are you doing?

873
01:10:17,259 --> 01:10:18,693
What's a testimony?

874
01:10:19,195 --> 01:10:20,794
Your story. But...

875
01:10:20,796 --> 01:10:22,999
Yeah, I see you. Come on up.

876
01:10:25,567 --> 01:10:26,800
Come on.

877
01:10:26,802 --> 01:10:27,870
No.

878
01:10:29,604 --> 01:10:32,574
You've made it this far. We'd
love to hear your testimony.

879
01:10:34,143 --> 01:10:35,778
Come on. Don't be shy now.

880
01:10:47,223 --> 01:10:48,654
Umm, hi, everyone.

881
01:10:51,227 --> 01:10:53,659
Oh, whoa.

882
01:10:53,661 --> 01:10:55,563
Sorry. Umm, I'm a bit of a mess.

883
01:10:56,799 --> 01:10:58,332
I was not planning on coming
here tonight,

884
01:10:58,334 --> 01:11:00,769
hence the awkward gown.

885
01:11:04,606 --> 01:11:06,541
But I want to be here with my
friends.

886
01:11:07,843 --> 01:11:12,580
The ones who think I'm shallow.
And I agree with them.

887
01:11:13,983 --> 01:11:17,286
I've only known superficial
relationships.

888
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:22,890
I mean they're safer. They don't
cost me anything.

889
01:11:22,892 --> 01:11:26,062
And I can protect myself from
being hurt.

890
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:35,805
A few weeks ago, I met a guy. A
really great guy.

891
01:11:36,272 --> 01:11:38,038
And, me being me,

892
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:42,945
I went after him pretending to
be someone I'm not.

893
01:11:43,913 --> 01:11:46,914
In order to get him to notice
me, I volunteered

894
01:11:46,916 --> 01:11:50,953
with this Christian organization
that he works with.

895
01:11:56,658 --> 01:12:01,261
And it was wrong. I mean this is
his ministry, his passion.

896
01:12:01,263 --> 01:12:04,166
And I treated it like it was a
game.

897
01:12:06,869 --> 01:12:09,803
Nothing is worth hurting the
ones that you love...

898
01:12:09,805 --> 01:12:12,341
that you care about.

899
01:12:13,876 --> 01:12:17,044
But while I was pretending to
know what I was doing,

900
01:12:17,046 --> 01:12:21,048
I actually started serving.

901
01:12:21,050 --> 01:12:23,352
Putting other people ahead of
myself.

902
01:12:24,286 --> 01:12:26,188
And that was a first. Trust me.

903
01:12:27,423 --> 01:12:28,623
But it felt good.

904
01:12:30,259 --> 01:12:35,064
And, I don't know, the best part
about all of this is that...

905
01:12:36,298 --> 01:12:39,935
While I was pretending to be
like him, a Christian...

906
01:12:42,838 --> 01:12:45,374
I was actually learning how to
be one.

907
01:12:46,842 --> 01:12:48,775
When I took the focus off myself

908
01:12:48,777 --> 01:12:51,879
and I stopped being so
selfish...

909
01:12:51,881 --> 01:12:56,884
I opened up to wanting to know
God and who He thinks I am.

910
01:12:56,886 --> 01:12:58,952
And then suddenly this whole
Christian thing,

911
01:12:58,954 --> 01:13:05,993
it just it made sense. And it
got real.

912
01:13:05,995 --> 01:13:09,999
So, I'm here tonight to share my
story.

913
01:13:13,302 --> 01:13:15,004
I don't want to be the old me.

914
01:13:16,172 --> 01:13:18,038
I want to be someone that
pleases God

915
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:24,945
and considers others, while
finding out who I truly am.

916
01:13:24,947 --> 01:13:26,681
So to all my friends...

917
01:13:27,983 --> 01:13:32,019
I'm so sorry. And I hope you'll
forgive me.

918
01:13:48,204 --> 01:13:50,137
Wow. What a great start.

919
01:14:08,557 --> 01:14:14,096
Wow. This is, this is amazing.
Let's, let's form a line.

920
01:14:15,497 --> 01:14:17,264
Who would like to go next?

921
01:14:17,266 --> 01:14:19,168
All right, come on up.

922
01:14:20,936 --> 01:14:23,503
Well hello, everyone. I was
really moved...

923
01:15:07,116 --> 01:15:09,318
I forgive you!

924
01:15:10,486 --> 01:15:14,054
Hey, Jason's here. He must've
heard you.

925
01:15:14,056 --> 01:15:16,089
He's not interested. Trust me.

926
01:15:16,091 --> 01:15:18,625
He'll come around. I mean look
at you.

927
01:15:18,627 --> 01:15:21,094
You're... You're stunning.

928
01:15:22,865 --> 01:15:24,965
But seriously, I need to thank
you.

929
01:15:24,967 --> 01:15:25,968
For what?

930
01:15:26,502 --> 01:15:27,503
You gave me confidence.

931
01:15:28,637 --> 01:15:32,072
Earlier, when I was upset, Wyatt
was really concerned.

932
01:15:32,074 --> 01:15:35,108
And he and I talked a long time.

933
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:36,877
And I told him how I felt.

934
01:15:36,879 --> 01:15:37,880
And?

935
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:39,046
And he said he felt the same.

936
01:15:39,048 --> 01:15:39,481
I knew it!

937
01:15:51,393 --> 01:15:53,527
Hey, I totally owe you one.

938
01:15:53,529 --> 01:15:56,530
Oh yeah? Well you can
start by teaching me the Bible.

939
01:15:56,532 --> 01:15:58,465
That book is ginormous.

940
01:15:58,467 --> 01:16:00,000
You can join my Bible study.

941
01:16:00,002 --> 01:16:03,136
That's a thing? I'd love to.

942
01:16:03,138 --> 01:16:05,074
Hey, you gonna come back in? You
can sit with us.

943
01:16:06,108 --> 01:16:10,145
Oh, umm, I don't think I can
face anyone else today.

944
01:16:10,979 --> 01:16:12,145
That's okay. Call me.

945
01:16:12,147 --> 01:16:13,282
Okay. Bye.

946
01:16:20,422 --> 01:16:22,155
Hey. Have you seen Victoria?

947
01:16:22,157 --> 01:16:23,357
Yeah, she literally left a
second ago.

948
01:16:23,359 --> 01:16:24,157
Okay.

949
01:17:22,451 --> 01:17:23,452
Jason!

950
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:26,088
Are you okay?

951
01:17:28,123 --> 01:17:29,124
I'm sorry.

952
01:17:30,058 --> 01:17:31,960
I should've listened to you the
other day.

953
01:17:32,561 --> 01:17:36,131
No, trust me. I would't have
wanted to date me either.

954
01:17:38,367 --> 01:17:40,602
I heard what you said in there.

955
01:17:44,573 --> 01:17:45,574
So...

956
01:17:48,710 --> 01:17:49,711
So...

957
01:18:19,141 --> 01:18:23,579
Oh, thank you. Oh that's
beautiful.

958
01:18:30,385 --> 01:18:32,319
So, do you guys like it?

959
01:18:32,321 --> 01:18:33,353
I love it.

960
01:18:33,355 --> 01:18:35,288
Did you really build this house?

961
01:18:35,290 --> 01:18:36,423
I wouldn't exactly say I built
it.

962
01:18:36,425 --> 01:18:37,691
But there's definitely a
crooked nail

963
01:18:37,693 --> 01:18:38,926
or two I can take credit for.

964
01:18:38,928 --> 01:18:43,365
But your aunt did do all the
decorating. I'm so proud of you.

965
01:18:47,236 --> 01:18:48,370
They're coming!

966
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:01,916
Let's go.

967
01:19:01,918 --> 01:19:02,551
This way.

968
01:19:03,953 --> 01:19:05,687
Hey, everyone! Gather around.
Come on.

969
01:19:07,189 --> 01:19:09,289
Jason is great in so many ways.

970
01:19:09,291 --> 01:19:12,294
I know. But we're taking it
slow.

971
01:19:13,161 --> 01:19:15,228
Oh, guess what? I joined a Bible
study.

972
01:19:15,230 --> 01:19:17,432
What have you done with my
sister?

973
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:20,333
I'm happy things are working out
for you.

974
01:19:20,335 --> 01:19:21,836
They will for you too.

975
01:19:21,838 --> 01:19:24,638
Actually, I got the job.

976
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:25,806
What? That's amazing!

977
01:19:25,808 --> 01:19:26,640
Yeah.

978
01:19:26,642 --> 01:19:27,643
Hey, everybody!

979
01:19:35,450 --> 01:19:38,220
I'd like to say a blessing over
the new house.

980
01:19:41,523 --> 01:19:45,394
God, thank You for everyone
here.

981
01:19:46,194 --> 01:19:48,495
We give this home to You

982
01:19:48,497 --> 01:19:54,267
and pray blessing over it and
Elena's family.

983
01:19:54,269 --> 01:19:57,137
In your name, amen.

984
01:19:57,139 --> 01:19:58,473
Amen.

985
01:19:59,675 --> 01:20:01,374
Welcome to your new home.

986
01:20:05,714 --> 01:20:07,380
Now let's go eat some cake!

987
01:20:39,314 --> 01:20:40,146
Nice work.

988
01:20:40,148 --> 01:20:41,784
I couldn't have done it without
you.

989
01:21:04,367 --> 01:21:09,367
