4
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:24,817
At the turn of the 20th century,

5
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,067
the world got hooked on occultism.

6
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:28,821
And Russia was no exception.

7
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,824
Spiritualist salons were
especially in demand.

8
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,830
Dear Baron, I don't know what to say.

9
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:41,792
My husband looked so alive. I touched him.

10
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,045
You and your colleague are
doing incredible things.

11
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:46,589
That's science.

12
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,799
It will erase the border between worlds,

13
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:50,799
just as it's erasing the distances.

14
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,803
I promise you that.

15
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,806
So death no longer means parting?

16
00:00:58,809 --> 00:00:59,810
Go.

17
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:02,104
Thank you, Baron.

18
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:12,280
Here's your fee for today's seance.

19
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:14,825
I can't do it.

20
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,828
Today was my last time.

21
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,498
All right, I can give you more.

22
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:21,832
How much?

23
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:27,755
No, I don't want money.

24
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:31,842
Listen to me,

25
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:35,051
I don't think you fully understand

26
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,889
the importance of our work.

27
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,848
We haven't started all this

28
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,851
just so some rich desperate widows

29
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:46,857
could talk to their deceased husbands.

30
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:49,860
We have opened

31
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,863
a gateway to the world of the dead.

32
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,866
And it's more important than

33
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,869
discovery of America.

34
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:02,873
It wasn't a ghost.

35
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,291
What?

36
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,877
They were never ghosts.

37
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,838
They were demons, fiends.

38
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,882
Dear God, what have we done?

39
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,883
We have opened a door for them.

40
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:15,884
Dear Lord, save and protect us!

41
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:16,887
Stop it!

42
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,888
Stop this nonsense right now!

43
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,892
Have mercy on us, sinners.

44
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:26,897
You don't understand.

45
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:30,901
You don't understand.

46
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:32,901
He's still here.

47
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:33,904
Here?

48
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:41,745
He's here.

49
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,171
I want to talk

50
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:53,924
to him.

51
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,293
GUESTS

52
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,027
Oh.

53
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,030
I overslept.

54
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,074
The place is empty anyway.

55
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,035
Why didn't you come yesterday?

56
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,037
It was really fun.

57
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,037
Nah.

58
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,040
I couldn't make it.

59
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,040
For sure.

60
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,043
As always.

61
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:56,046
I mean it. I couldn't make it.

62
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,054
Have you made a choice?

63
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,057
No, not this.

64
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:10,894
Miss, are you in a hurry?

65
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,061
That's a pretty nice place, you like it?

66
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,062
I guess it is.

67
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,063
Stop, they have bouncers.

68
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,064
What are you talking about?

69
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,068
Here. Sit down, baby.

70
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,071
These are mine.

71
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,072
Hello guys!

72
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,073
Oh, hello.

73
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,076
Miss?

74
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,035
Yes?

75
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,076
So, I'll have...

76
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,079
We have a delicious dessert.

77
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,082
Tell me, please, do you
have any strong drinks?

78
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:38,421
They are from Moscow.

79
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,089
And they are having a
mega cool party tonight.

80
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,093
They are organizers or something.

81
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,803
See the guy with a tattoo?

82
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,055
That's Nikita. He's so freaking awesome!

83
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:49,099
Katya, I'm dying! We have to go there!

84
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:52,227
That guy!

85
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,395
He's staring at you.

86
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:57,357
I noticed.

87
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:58,817
Katya!

88
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,110
Give him a smile, will you?

89
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,530
Come on, it's invitation-only.

90
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,698
Seriously, how long are you gonna

91
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,659
keep mourning that prince of yours?

92
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,536
It's been half a year.

93
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:10,245
He's not worth it.

94
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,246
We were planning to set the prices higher.

95
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:15,248
Set up a monitor for me and forget it.

96
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,418
We need to get more sound.

97
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,837
We don't have enough volume.

98
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,717
Our Vadik seems to have
a crush on the waitress.

99
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:27,054
The brunette?

100
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:29,137
She's a cute one.

101
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,140
What's your bet?

102
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,141
He'll get too shy.

103
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,142
I'm right here guys.

104
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,145
Whoops.

105
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,148
How would he handle her?
No buttons, no equalizer.

106
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:39,399
Go to hell!

107
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:40,734
All right, all right.

108
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:42,611
We should help our baby.

109
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:44,154
We surely will.

110
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,157
Dearest Sasha,

111
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:51,161
Tell me, what are you
doing tonight after work?

112
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:52,705
Nothing.

113
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,164
Wonderful.

114
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,042
Guess what!

115
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,170
They want us to show them the seaside.

116
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,172
Wanna have a ride, you're in?

117
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,174
Come on, let's go have some fun!

118
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,187
Wow-wow-wow.

119
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:21,650
Watch your step, carefully, watch you step.

120
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,202
Woo, awesome!

121
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,205
This is magical!

122
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,209
Just look around, it's so beautiful!

123
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:45,213
Don't fall behind!

124
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:46,214
Don't make us wait!

125
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,217
So are you coming tonight?

126
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,176
Where?

127
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:50,345
To, to the party.

128
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:53,223
Or are you busy?

129
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:55,643
I'm not.

130
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:56,894
I'm free.

131
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:00,230
Are you cold?

132
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,230
Katya!

133
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,275
They are calling for us.

134
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,862
Fre-e-e-edo-o-o-om!

135
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,238
Come on, faster!

136
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:12,660
Hey, I don't wanna swim!

137
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:15,078
Come on, back!

138
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,248
It's so cold!

139
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,252
Stop, not there!

140
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,257
Did you see that house? Looks ancient.

141
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,261
I bet it's empty.

142
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:32,513
You wish!

143
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:34,431
We got a party to throw.

144
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,282
Katya!

145
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,285
Come join us!

146
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,834
Katya, here!

147
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:02,460
Oh, thanks.

148
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:04,294
So, do you like it?

149
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:09,299
I didn't know this place
hosted events like this.

150
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,303
I thought this was just
an abandoned factory.

151
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:15,305
It doesn't host anything.

152
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:17,641
You mean...

153
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,101
This is illegal?

154
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,310
That's the whole point.

155
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,981
We firmly believe that drinking and dancing

156
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:27,317
require no permission by
any kinds or authorities!

157
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,320
It's so unbelievably cool!

158
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:33,323
I know, right?

159
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:34,658
I want selfie!

160
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,453
Over here!

161
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,364
Well, aren't we awesome!

162
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,576
This is the best party I've ever been to!

163
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,662
Actually, this is mass market.

164
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,622
We keep the best for ourselves.

165
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:22,873
What do we keep?

166
00:10:22,915 --> 00:10:24,124
The best of the best of the best!

167
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,375
We don't have anything.

168
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:27,335
Well, the girls are local.

169
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,378
They can help.

170
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,378
What do you need?

171
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,925
Well, the thing is, we like to pay

172
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:33,884
Visits.

173
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:37,220
Visits to very special
places, with no hosts.

174
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,388
You want to break into someone's house?

175
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,392
Nothing bad. Just a house party.

176
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:44,394
We don't steal. And we clean up afterwards.

177
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:46,396
But we need a special house.

178
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:48,774
Like the one on the beach.

179
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,400
Where you worked in over the summer.

180
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,404
Sasha told us everything already.

181
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:06,500
This is not up for discussion.

182
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,418
You couldn't keep your mouth shut?

183
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:10,418
But it's a perfect option!

184
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,921
Your mysterious prince
left long ago anyway.

185
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:13,922
And you know the place.

186
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:15,008
I said no.

187
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,427
Katya, you brought us
to his house yourself.

188
00:11:18,428 --> 00:11:21,429
You have a problem. And
it needs to be fixed.

189
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,976
How exactly? By going to that house?

190
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,060
Great idea!

191
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,938
Not just going, Katya. Going with Vadik.

192
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,107
Scientists have proven that

193
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:31,484
repressing bad memories is good.

194
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:34,444
Katya, when are you gonna
stop torturing yourself?

195
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,404
You like that Vadik, do you?

196
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:37,445
You do.

197
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,449
First time you even look at someone else.

198
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:42,453
You're smiling again. So give it a chance.

199
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,561
Crimean Gothic in all its beauty.

200
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:35,899
Wow!

201
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:36,984
Cool!

202
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,570
I'd like to remind you
not to post anything.

203
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:42,573
Why?

204
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:45,576
Do you want us to get busted?

205
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:17,691
So who is the owner?

206
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:19,610
He's an architect.

207
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,612
He's pretty well off, that architect.

208
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:22,613
Yeah.

209
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,641
It's the bottom lock.

210
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:52,641
They never used the top one.

211
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:55,479
Wait! You said he lives there alone.

212
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:56,647
They died.

213
00:14:57,648 --> 00:14:58,649
His wife and kid.

214
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,358
Here?

215
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:04,112
No. In a car crash.

216
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,596
Well, to quote a classic,

217
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:31,680
the beauty of country
life is in its informality.

218
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:32,683
Brilliant!

219
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,137
That's a neat place!

220
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:12,556
Look at the fireplace!

221
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:15,601
Shall we start it?

222
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:16,560
Sure.

223
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:40,083
Sorry!

224
00:16:40,751 --> 00:16:42,709
One hell of a place but if you ask me,

225
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:44,421
there's a little much of this...

226
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,132
...atmospheric decrepitude.

227
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,757
And one of the doors doesn't open.

228
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:50,469
Probably stuck.

229
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:52,763
It's damp.

230
00:17:08,571 --> 00:17:09,780
Maybe let's blow?

231
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:14,785
There's no draft.

232
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:18,789
Maybe there's a heater?

233
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:04,835
Sorry.

234
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:06,837
I'm just looking for a heater.

235
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:10,132
They should be under the stairs.

236
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:11,133
Thanks

237
00:18:36,534 --> 00:18:37,868
I say!

238
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:09,900
Put it back now.

239
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:11,902
You know the rules.

240
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:49,147
What's that book?

241
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:51,942
A Study of Demonic Entities.

242
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:55,944
Nikolai Karlovich von Grubbe.

243
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:56,947
That's our house.

244
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:05,956
That's quite a freak show.

245
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,001
This part is awesome.

246
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:13,964
All the sketches presented in the book

247
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:17,801
were made by the author during his

248
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:20,804
visionary revelations.

249
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:22,973
Like, they were posing?

250
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:32,315
What were they smoking back then?

251
00:20:33,984 --> 00:20:34,985
Great question.

252
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:49,057
You think Her Majesty will
deign to enter the kitchen?

253
00:21:49,059 --> 00:21:51,061
Or does she think she
hired free waitresses?

254
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:54,397
You just want her boyfriend.

255
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:09,077
You know, your fairy-tale
castle is in decay.

256
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,247
There's mold everywhere.

257
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:30,100
That's our dining room.

258
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:32,100
Yeah.

259
00:22:32,102 --> 00:22:33,479
The Baron's in the middle.

260
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:35,105
Let me.

261
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:45,113
Baron von Grubbe. A famous
philologist and mystic.

262
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:48,116
In the early 20th century,
his country house was known

263
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:49,495
as the biggest spiritualist salon

264
00:22:49,537 --> 00:22:50,536
of the Crimean Riviera.

265
00:22:50,538 --> 00:22:52,205
He claimed that the Devil himself

266
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:53,916
showed him the dwellers of Hell.

267
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:55,375
Let me have a look.

268
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:01,131
Died at a psychiatric hospital in Berlin.

269
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:04,802
Damn.

270
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:07,137
I almost believed it. Here.

271
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:22,152
Who is this dude?

272
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:24,154
I know him.

273
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:26,239
It's Alexander Blok, idiot.

274
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:29,409
Nikita, Nikita...

275
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:30,578
Listen.

276
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:33,914
The best people of that
time summoned spirits here.

277
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:35,163
Why shouldn't we?

278
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:37,167
We are also the best people.

279
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,171
Seriously?

280
00:23:42,172 --> 00:23:44,174
A spiritualist seance?

281
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,678
It's all pretty clear.

282
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:49,177
So who are we calling?

283
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:50,180
Pushkin.

284
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:52,180
At least not Tsoi.

285
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:55,183
Let's call the Baron. Pay
our respects to the host.

286
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:58,355
Right! An insane ghost is
exactly what we are missing.

287
00:23:58,522 --> 00:23:59,187
Let's do it.

288
00:23:59,189 --> 00:24:00,190
Did you call me?

289
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:05,193
Okay.

290
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:07,155
Okay. Now we need a medium.

291
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:08,281
Oh...

292
00:24:08,491 --> 00:24:09,950
Can I do it?

293
00:24:10,784 --> 00:24:11,619
Yeah?

294
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:23,171
I am calling the spirit

295
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:25,257
of Baron von Grubbe.

296
00:24:28,552 --> 00:24:29,887
All right, all right, it's me.

297
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:42,232
I am calling the spirit
of Baron von Grubbe.

298
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:48,781
I am calling the spirit
of Baron von Grubbe.

299
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:55,245
Baron von Grubbe, if you are here,

300
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:57,330
give us a sign.

301
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:10,969
Must be the shutters.

302
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:15,263
Listen, this is not funny anymore.

303
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:16,266
Quiet.

304
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:22,272
There's someone in the house.

305
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:53,303
Let's assume you got the wrong address.

306
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:58,433
All right, all right.

307
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:03,313
We're coming out. We're all coming out.

308
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:05,440
Move it guys.

309
00:26:05,774 --> 00:26:08,235
See, we are moving along, nice and fast.

310
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:10,318
This is embarrassing.

311
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,319
Get out of here!

312
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:14,322
Look, we thought the house was empty.

313
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:15,826
We are not some thieves or hobos.

314
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:19,329
I don't care about you. Out!

315
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,124
I won't call the police.

316
00:26:24,585 --> 00:26:25,335
Why?

317
00:26:25,544 --> 00:26:26,294
Nikita!

318
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:27,335
No, no, no.

319
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:28,088
I'm serious.

320
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,382
Why haven't you called the
police several hours ago?

321
00:26:31,341 --> 00:26:32,801
You don't understand.

322
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:35,343
Did he not hear us?

323
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:37,347
How long have we been here?

324
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:40,348
Look at him! He's high as shit!

325
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,349
Calm down!

326
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:42,352
He's barely standing.

327
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:46,356
What makes you think he's the owner?

328
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:49,357
The house is boarded up.

329
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:50,360
Where's Katya?

330
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:07,375
Get out of here!

331
00:27:07,377 --> 00:27:08,376
All right, all right.

332
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:09,377
Get out!

333
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:10,378
Can I grab my things?

334
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,379
Easy, easy.

335
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:12,382
Get out of here!

336
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:13,425
Easy, easy.

337
00:27:14,593 --> 00:27:16,384
Take it easy. We're going.

338
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:17,262
Out.

339
00:27:22,768 --> 00:27:23,602
Nikita!

340
00:27:32,402 --> 00:27:33,236
Alive?

341
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:35,405
I keep it at minimum.

342
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,419
Where did he even come from?

343
00:27:57,427 --> 00:27:58,428
So is he the owner?

344
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:04,434
No.

345
00:28:05,435 --> 00:28:06,687
That's what I told you.

346
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:09,064
He's some hobo.

347
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:11,441
It's low season, so he broke in.

348
00:28:13,443 --> 00:28:14,442
What if he talks?

349
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:15,443
He won't remember any of this.

350
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:17,447
We'll just lock him up somewhere.

351
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:19,449
In the cellar.

352
00:28:21,452 --> 00:28:22,536
That's a bit too harsh.

353
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:23,912
What else can we do?

354
00:28:24,455 --> 00:28:26,457
He wakes up, he'll
start attacking us again.

355
00:28:46,977 --> 00:28:48,646
Hey, let's just get the hell out of here?

356
00:28:49,146 --> 00:28:49,980
What?

357
00:28:50,481 --> 00:28:51,482
This is all...

358
00:28:52,483 --> 00:28:54,483
Unbelievable. Seriously?

359
00:28:54,485 --> 00:28:57,486
We've arranged such a
romantic setup for you,

360
00:28:57,488 --> 00:28:59,488
and you wanna bail?

361
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:04,495
No, no, no. Come on. Come
on, come on. Katya's waiting.

362
00:29:16,507 --> 00:29:17,508
Careful.

363
00:29:22,513 --> 00:29:24,515
Damn it. Put him down.

364
00:29:27,518 --> 00:29:28,519
That's not human.

365
00:29:34,316 --> 00:29:36,527
Hey, don't forget to tuck him in.

366
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,529
You want him to freeze to death?

367
00:29:41,532 --> 00:29:43,534
Fine, I'll go find something.

368
00:30:12,563 --> 00:30:13,564
Mold everywhere.

369
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:15,566
Didn't notice it before.

370
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:17,566
Can you handle it?

371
00:30:17,568 --> 00:30:18,902
Yes, I have experience.

372
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:21,154
And I need the money to pay for college.

373
00:30:31,582 --> 00:30:34,585
Here's the key to the bottom lock.

374
00:30:35,586 --> 00:30:37,505
The top one gets stuck all the time,

375
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:38,631
so we don't use it.

376
00:30:42,259 --> 00:30:43,594
I don't use it.

377
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:49,224
Let's go upstairs.

378
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:18,253
Seriously, it's been half a year.

379
00:31:20,631 --> 00:31:21,590
You just need to accept it

380
00:31:21,632 --> 00:31:22,675
and move on with your life.

381
00:31:23,634 --> 00:31:24,635
Your life!

382
00:31:25,636 --> 00:31:27,054
Sometimes I think that the house

383
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:28,681
started falling apart without her.

384
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,642
I see them every day.

385
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:33,727
I wake up, and everything is decaying

386
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:34,770
and crumbling down.

387
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:39,399
I say you should come back to Moscow.

388
00:31:41,485 --> 00:31:43,654
Or next time, I'll take you there by force.

389
00:33:05,736 --> 00:33:07,362
It looks like he was staying here.

390
00:33:10,658 --> 00:33:12,741
How could anyone stay
here? It's cold as hell.

391
00:33:12,743 --> 00:33:14,745
Just coming here to sleep?

392
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,001
I think it's kinda cool.

393
00:33:22,753 --> 00:33:23,754
Summoners...

394
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:25,756
of crazy ghosts.

395
00:33:30,343 --> 00:33:31,720
You know, we've never done it...

396
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:33,972
in a haunted house.

397
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:44,251
Boo!

398
00:34:45,836 --> 00:34:46,837
God damn it, Artur!

399
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,839
Catch.

400
00:34:50,841 --> 00:34:51,842
I'm gonna go.

401
00:34:53,844 --> 00:34:54,845
Cold?

402
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,840
This species of low-order demons

403
00:35:31,882 --> 00:35:33,882
dwell in the damp gloom of Hell.

404
00:35:33,884 --> 00:35:36,887
They're capable of inducing
sleep and colorful visions,

405
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:38,931
while luring human souls

406
00:35:38,972 --> 00:35:40,933
and feeding on their suffering.

407
00:35:43,143 --> 00:35:43,977
Wait, wait.

408
00:35:44,895 --> 00:35:46,895
Despite their innate cowardice,

409
00:35:46,897 --> 00:35:48,649
these jackals of hell attack anyone

410
00:35:48,691 --> 00:35:50,358
who dares to stand in their way.

411
00:35:50,568 --> 00:35:51,902
Stop it.

412
00:35:52,903 --> 00:35:55,906
It used to be someone's favorite piece.

413
00:35:57,658 --> 00:35:58,492
Oops.

414
00:35:58,534 --> 00:35:59,535
I found this in the cellar.

415
00:36:00,911 --> 00:36:02,913
Nearly locked him up with it.

416
00:36:03,914 --> 00:36:04,915
Oh!

417
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:06,917
Pretty nice!

418
00:36:12,923 --> 00:36:13,924
Alright.

419
00:36:14,925 --> 00:36:16,969
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

420
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:19,346
Nick!

421
00:36:24,935 --> 00:36:25,936
Well.

422
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:27,938
to force majeure.

423
00:36:29,482 --> 00:36:30,357
Clink!

424
00:36:33,944 --> 00:36:35,944
Well, let's continue the seance?

425
00:36:35,946 --> 00:36:38,947
To Hell with spiritualism, let's roll!

426
00:36:38,949 --> 00:36:39,783
Finally!

427
00:37:21,992 --> 00:37:23,994
I'm sorry. I thought
you've already finished.

428
00:37:24,995 --> 00:37:25,996
Almost.

429
00:37:33,003 --> 00:37:34,004
Do you see them?

430
00:37:38,008 --> 00:37:38,801
Where?

431
00:37:41,011 --> 00:37:43,013
Over there. Standing and watching.

432
00:37:52,022 --> 00:37:53,023
There's no one there.

433
00:38:01,031 --> 00:38:02,032
Andrey?

434
00:38:28,601 --> 00:38:29,977
Did you need something, Katya?

435
00:38:31,061 --> 00:38:35,065
Yes, I found this in the
nursery, behind stuffed toys.

436
00:38:36,066 --> 00:38:38,068
I'm not sure if I should throw this out.

437
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,072
It's just my wife's mug.

438
00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:47,077
I guess he broke it and hid it.

439
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:52,082
I was thinking...

440
00:38:54,084 --> 00:38:55,210
We could fix it.

441
00:38:57,087 --> 00:38:58,088
Why?

442
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,091
As a memory.

443
00:39:03,677 --> 00:39:04,845
To keep from forgetting?

444
00:39:15,397 --> 00:39:17,107
Okay, give it to me.

445
00:39:18,108 --> 00:39:19,109
Shit.

446
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,111
Damn it. I'm sorry.

447
00:39:22,655 --> 00:39:24,114
Hold this, hold this.

448
00:39:25,491 --> 00:39:26,492
Is it bad?

449
00:39:27,493 --> 00:39:28,326
No.

450
00:39:37,002 --> 00:39:38,879
Go, Katya. There's a...

451
00:39:40,005 --> 00:39:41,131
first-aid kit in the kitchen.

452
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:20,436
Have you seen Katya?

453
00:41:20,438 --> 00:41:21,189
What?

454
00:41:21,231 --> 00:41:22,065
Have you seen Katya?

455
00:41:22,232 --> 00:41:23,025
No!

456
00:41:43,712 --> 00:41:44,547
Katya?

457
00:41:48,258 --> 00:41:49,259
I've been looking for you.

458
00:41:53,263 --> 00:41:54,347
So what happened?

459
00:41:56,183 --> 00:41:57,100
Nothing.

460
00:42:02,272 --> 00:42:04,191
I don't like this either.

461
00:42:04,274 --> 00:42:05,275
Let's leave.

462
00:42:07,069 --> 00:42:07,986
Katya!

463
00:44:15,405 --> 00:44:17,407
LEONIDOV, ANDREY NIKOLAEVICH

464
00:45:05,456 --> 00:45:07,374
I texted you that it's over.

465
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:09,460
I don't need your services anymore.

466
00:45:10,461 --> 00:45:12,463
I'm sorry. I guess I
didn't get the message.

467
00:45:13,756 --> 00:45:15,464
Are you leaving already?

468
00:45:15,466 --> 00:45:17,468
It's still early August.

469
00:45:18,051 --> 00:45:19,094
I'm leaving.

470
00:45:20,471 --> 00:45:23,472
Can I come in, just to charge my phone?

471
00:45:23,474 --> 00:45:24,475
The battery's dead.

472
00:45:44,495 --> 00:45:47,498
Actually, I should admit, my phone is fine.

473
00:45:49,166 --> 00:45:50,876
Just don't interrupt me, please,

474
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:52,545
or I won't be able to finish.

475
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,258
I think that now...

476
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:00,969
You shouldn't be alone.

477
00:46:03,514 --> 00:46:06,517
It's like you've buried
yourself together with them.

478
00:46:07,518 --> 00:46:08,517
I can see that.

479
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:11,313
And if you allow me to stay

480
00:46:11,522 --> 00:46:12,521
by your side...

481
00:46:12,523 --> 00:46:13,524
Katya!

482
00:46:14,525 --> 00:46:15,526
No one,

483
00:46:16,527 --> 00:46:17,528
especially you,

484
00:46:18,529 --> 00:46:20,529
can be near me right now.

485
00:46:20,531 --> 00:46:23,532
No-no-no, you are
saying the wrong thing.

486
00:46:23,534 --> 00:46:24,535
I...

487
00:46:25,536 --> 00:46:26,537
I know that...

488
00:46:26,745 --> 00:46:27,996
I know you need me.

489
00:46:30,373 --> 00:46:31,374
I need you...

490
00:46:32,543 --> 00:46:33,418
as well.

491
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:49,560
Go away.

492
00:46:54,397 --> 00:46:56,567
And never come back to this house.

493
00:47:06,577 --> 00:47:07,578
Andrey.

494
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:09,580
This is Katya.

495
00:47:12,165 --> 00:47:13,584
Say something. I...

496
00:47:15,586 --> 00:47:17,588
I know you've recognized me.

497
00:47:20,591 --> 00:47:22,593
Are you okay down there?

498
00:47:23,343 --> 00:47:25,594
I'm sorry. I know it's a stupid question,

499
00:47:25,596 --> 00:47:27,598
and all of this is just horrible.

500
00:47:29,767 --> 00:47:30,768
Andrey!

501
00:47:34,605 --> 00:47:35,606
Andrey!

502
00:47:36,607 --> 00:47:38,526
Please say something.

503
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:41,612
I'll find something to pry it open.

504
00:47:51,622 --> 00:47:52,873
Go away.

505
00:47:53,624 --> 00:47:54,625
Andrey.

506
00:48:07,638 --> 00:48:08,639
Go away.

507
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:10,639
You can't...

508
00:48:10,641 --> 00:48:11,642
be here.

509
00:48:13,644 --> 00:48:14,645
Here's...

510
00:48:16,647 --> 00:48:17,606
death.

511
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:50,679
No again?

512
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:51,682
Enough already.

513
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:00,691
Don't do this...

514
00:49:02,693 --> 00:49:03,694
Don't do that...

515
00:49:07,698 --> 00:49:08,699
That's fine by me!

516
00:49:11,702 --> 00:49:12,703
It's not like I care.

517
00:49:33,516 --> 00:49:34,725
Please, come with me.

518
00:49:35,726 --> 00:49:37,728
We need to open the cellar.

519
00:49:38,061 --> 00:49:39,605
How about you explain this first?

520
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:43,734
Vadik, please, I...

521
00:49:44,442 --> 00:49:45,736
I don't know. I...

522
00:49:46,737 --> 00:49:48,446
I messed up.

523
00:49:51,742 --> 00:49:52,743
So he is the owner?

524
00:49:53,744 --> 00:49:56,745
This house has been boarded
up for several months.

525
00:49:56,747 --> 00:49:58,580
I didn't expect to see him here.

526
00:49:58,582 --> 00:49:59,500
But you recognized him?

527
00:49:59,667 --> 00:50:01,041
Something happened to him.

528
00:50:01,043 --> 00:50:02,795
We have to get him out of there.

529
00:50:03,754 --> 00:50:04,755
Do you two...

530
00:50:05,756 --> 00:50:06,757
have a story?

531
00:50:07,758 --> 00:50:08,759
I...

532
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,759
What does it matter?

533
00:50:10,761 --> 00:50:13,762
Seriously? What a tiny unimportant detail.

534
00:50:13,764 --> 00:50:15,764
We broke into his house!

535
00:50:15,766 --> 00:50:16,767
Problems?

536
00:50:17,685 --> 00:50:18,767
We are leaving.

537
00:50:18,769 --> 00:50:20,771
This is the owner. And they had an affair.

538
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:24,567
It's not like that, and...

539
00:50:24,775 --> 00:50:26,569
And none of this even matters.

540
00:50:26,735 --> 00:50:27,778
Holy crap!

541
00:50:33,534 --> 00:50:35,784
Wait! Something's going on in this house.

542
00:50:35,786 --> 00:50:38,119
It's not normal, the way
everything's falling apart.

543
00:50:38,121 --> 00:50:39,705
And the cellar with Andrey...

544
00:50:39,707 --> 00:50:41,790
I don't know how to explain it.

545
00:50:41,792 --> 00:50:43,792
It's called a neglected house.

546
00:50:43,794 --> 00:50:45,713
And your Andrey is a psycho.

547
00:50:45,796 --> 00:50:47,796
Katya, are you saying that's the guy?

548
00:50:47,798 --> 00:50:48,797
Where are you going?

549
00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:49,798
Didn't you get it?

550
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,800
This is the owner. She lied.

551
00:50:51,802 --> 00:50:53,176
So what if he's the owner?

552
00:50:53,178 --> 00:50:54,680
He's locked up and napping.

553
00:50:54,805 --> 00:50:56,763
We'll go in the morning, as planned.

554
00:50:56,765 --> 00:50:57,766
You gonna lock her up too?

555
00:50:57,808 --> 00:50:58,892
You've got to listen to me!

556
00:50:58,934 --> 00:51:00,934
Maybe I should lock
you up with that Andrey.

557
00:51:00,936 --> 00:51:02,811
Hey, knock it off!

558
00:51:02,813 --> 00:51:04,815
Listen, sort it out with your girlfriend!

559
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:05,816
Or is she?

560
00:51:06,358 --> 00:51:07,818
Maybe she's not yours anymore.

561
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:09,820
This conversation's over.

562
00:51:11,572 --> 00:51:13,824
I came here to have fun,
and I intend to do so! Okay?

563
00:51:17,828 --> 00:51:18,829
Why so quiet?

564
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:24,084
Vadik, I'm begging you!

565
00:51:25,836 --> 00:51:26,712
Katya.

566
00:51:27,796 --> 00:51:28,672
I got it all.

567
00:51:28,839 --> 00:51:30,841
Just stop making up nonsense!

568
00:52:26,897 --> 00:52:27,898
Hi there!

569
00:53:08,939 --> 00:53:09,940
What the hell?

570
00:53:10,941 --> 00:53:12,943
Hey, where did this ball come from?

571
00:53:43,098 --> 00:53:44,975
What kind of psycho would do this?

572
00:53:45,976 --> 00:53:46,975
That's enough.

573
00:53:46,977 --> 00:53:48,521
We're packing up and leaving.

574
00:53:51,064 --> 00:53:52,941
Where? Why are you freaking out?

575
00:53:52,983 --> 00:53:54,317
This is not funny anymore.

576
00:53:56,987 --> 00:53:58,989
Did she blind you or something?

577
00:53:59,907 --> 00:54:01,992
Look around! There's no party. It's over.

578
00:54:02,576 --> 00:54:03,867
That's for me to decide.

579
00:54:03,869 --> 00:54:05,621
You don't like it, call a taxi.

580
00:54:06,997 --> 00:54:07,998
Sasha!

581
00:54:09,542 --> 00:54:10,584
Do you want to go?

582
00:54:11,126 --> 00:54:12,002
Not really.

583
00:54:14,004 --> 00:54:15,005
Here we go then!

584
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:20,445
Damn it.

585
00:55:21,071 --> 00:55:22,072
Where did he go?

586
00:56:11,121 --> 00:56:13,121
The subscriber is not available now.

587
00:56:13,123 --> 00:56:14,458
Please, try calling back later.

588
00:56:48,158 --> 00:56:49,159
Oh, crap!

589
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,203
You really scared me.

590
00:56:53,163 --> 00:56:54,289
Are you lost or something?

591
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:39,209
Occupied.

592
00:58:17,247 --> 00:58:18,248
Katya?

593
00:58:37,267 --> 00:58:39,267
The subscriber is not available now.

594
00:58:39,269 --> 00:58:41,271
Please, try calling back later.

595
01:00:08,358 --> 01:00:09,527
God damn it! You scared me!

596
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,361
Have you seen Artur?

597
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:14,031
No.

598
01:00:15,365 --> 01:00:17,242
Maybe he left with Polina?

599
01:00:17,785 --> 01:00:18,786
The cellar's open.

600
01:00:18,827 --> 01:00:19,868
What the heck?

601
01:00:19,870 --> 01:00:20,871
Did you let him out?

602
01:00:21,914 --> 01:00:22,665
No.

603
01:01:12,506 --> 01:01:13,423
Sasha!

604
01:01:25,936 --> 01:01:27,395
What the hell is that?

605
01:01:27,437 --> 01:01:28,856
Quietly, leave now

606
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:42,745
Katya!

607
01:01:57,468 --> 01:01:58,469
What on earth was that?

608
01:01:59,470 --> 01:02:00,471
Sasha?

609
01:02:05,017 --> 01:02:05,851
Let's go.

610
01:02:05,976 --> 01:02:07,060
Come on, come on, come on.

611
01:02:11,482 --> 01:02:13,484
Can someone explain to me what's going on?

612
01:02:23,494 --> 01:02:24,495
God damn.

613
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:38,008
You don't understand.

614
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:40,218
They're gonna kill Andrey!
They're gonna kill him!

615
01:02:40,385 --> 01:02:41,510
Calm down. Easy.

616
01:02:41,512 --> 01:02:42,513
It's okay. Easy. Easy.

617
01:02:58,487 --> 01:02:59,863
I couldn't reach Polina.

618
01:03:01,323 --> 01:03:02,324
Not now.

619
01:03:02,533 --> 01:03:03,534
There's another car!

620
01:04:38,629 --> 01:04:39,672
Don't look!

621
01:05:10,661 --> 01:05:11,662
Get out of the car!

622
01:05:16,667 --> 01:05:17,668
Into the house!

623
01:05:52,703 --> 01:05:53,704
This isn't gonna help.

624
01:05:54,412 --> 01:05:55,704
We need more fire.

625
01:05:55,706 --> 01:05:56,705
They don't like fire.

626
01:05:56,707 --> 01:05:58,709
First thing they did was clog the chimney.

627
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:00,709
You know them well?

628
01:06:00,711 --> 01:06:01,754
Well enough.

629
01:06:04,715 --> 01:06:05,714
What are those creeps?

630
01:06:05,716 --> 01:06:07,300
Vadik, stop it.

631
01:06:07,801 --> 01:06:09,720
He knew about them from the start.

632
01:06:10,721 --> 01:06:11,720
And now everyone's dead.

633
01:06:11,722 --> 01:06:12,723
They're dead!

634
01:06:14,475 --> 01:06:15,726
No one invited you here.

635
01:06:20,272 --> 01:06:21,732
Why are you still alive?

636
01:06:24,527 --> 01:06:25,736
Because I brought them here.

637
01:06:32,743 --> 01:06:33,744
Now, listen to me!

638
01:06:34,202 --> 01:06:35,746
Your only chance is to stay here.

639
01:06:36,747 --> 01:06:37,746
Where it's warm.

640
01:06:37,748 --> 01:06:39,750
And burn anything you can find.

641
01:06:41,752 --> 01:06:42,751
You leave in the morning...

642
01:06:42,753 --> 01:06:44,753
when they are not so dangerous.

643
01:06:44,755 --> 01:06:45,756
Wanna help?

644
01:06:46,089 --> 01:06:47,550
Get enough firewood.

645
01:06:53,764 --> 01:06:54,765
So they are

646
01:06:55,766 --> 01:06:56,767
Phantoms?

647
01:06:57,768 --> 01:06:58,769
Demons

648
01:07:00,771 --> 01:07:02,355
Who assumed the shape of my wife and son.

649
01:07:04,775 --> 01:07:05,984
Monsters from another world.

650
01:07:08,779 --> 01:07:09,780
So all of that is real?

651
01:07:11,782 --> 01:07:13,617
You still have doubts?

652
01:07:16,787 --> 01:07:17,788
He studied Hell.

653
01:07:18,789 --> 01:07:20,791
He found the door and left it open.

654
01:07:21,792 --> 01:07:23,794
When I bought the house,
I didn't believe it either.

655
01:07:24,795 --> 01:07:25,796
What do they want?

656
01:07:27,172 --> 01:07:28,006
Only me.

657
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,301
You presented a danger to me,

658
01:07:31,343 --> 01:07:32,845
so they started killing you.

659
01:07:35,806 --> 01:07:37,808
Keep it. We need to make a torch.

660
01:07:41,812 --> 01:07:43,313
Did they kill before us?

661
01:07:45,774 --> 01:07:47,067
My friend tried to take me away.

662
01:07:50,529 --> 01:07:52,740
I didn't know their ways back then.

663
01:07:53,907 --> 01:07:55,699
After that, I locked the house,

664
01:07:55,701 --> 01:07:57,495
isolated myself from the world

665
01:07:58,829 --> 01:07:59,830
and learned how to live with them.

666
01:08:03,834 --> 01:08:05,836
Only I hadn't anticipated you.

667
01:08:26,313 --> 01:08:27,608
Keep the fire burning.

668
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:29,401
You can leave in the morning.

669
01:08:31,904 --> 01:08:32,820
Andrey, wait!

670
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,652
I'm gonna make some tea.

671
01:11:25,536 --> 01:11:26,326
Mommy!

672
01:11:26,328 --> 01:11:27,329
You wanna spin?

673
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:31,041
Come!

674
01:11:32,042 --> 01:11:33,043
Let me spin you!

675
01:11:34,044 --> 01:11:35,045
Hurray!

676
01:11:40,050 --> 01:11:43,053
How many times more? I am dizzy!

677
01:11:47,057 --> 01:11:47,933
Andrey!

678
01:11:51,061 --> 01:11:52,062
Pass the ball!

679
01:11:55,065 --> 01:11:56,066
Hit, hit, hit!

680
01:11:56,484 --> 01:11:58,066
Great job, come on, come on, come on.

681
01:11:58,068 --> 01:11:59,069
come on, come on, come on!

682
01:12:53,123 --> 01:12:54,291
You shouldn't have followed me.

683
01:12:56,126 --> 01:12:57,545
I could've held them off till morning.

684
01:13:14,144 --> 01:13:15,145
What was that?

685
01:13:17,565 --> 01:13:18,649
These monsters

686
01:13:22,277 --> 01:13:25,155
exist at the cost of those who let them in.

687
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:31,161
Feeding on their pain.

688
01:13:34,039 --> 01:13:35,165
But giving something in return.

689
01:13:37,167 --> 01:13:38,961
To me, they give an illusion

690
01:13:40,671 --> 01:13:42,172
that my family is still alive.

691
01:13:46,176 --> 01:13:47,177
Only I lose them

692
01:13:49,179 --> 01:13:50,180
every time.

693
01:13:51,181 --> 01:13:52,182
Again and again.

694
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:10,200
Back then, in the summer,

695
01:14:13,579 --> 01:14:14,788
they were here?

696
01:14:28,218 --> 01:14:29,219
I was going insane.

697
01:14:32,222 --> 01:14:34,224
Praying for things to go back to normal.

698
01:14:36,226 --> 01:14:37,227
And I was heard.

699
01:14:40,230 --> 01:14:41,314
I started having dreams.

700
01:14:43,233 --> 01:14:44,234
Very real dreams.

701
01:14:46,236 --> 01:14:48,238
That's how they kept me from forgetting.

702
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:52,242
Then came the dampness.

703
01:14:54,244 --> 01:14:55,245
And then they came.

704
01:14:56,830 --> 01:14:58,248
Standing there, watching,

705
01:14:59,249 --> 01:15:01,043
as if saying,

706
01:15:02,252 --> 01:15:03,253
"Let us in.

707
01:15:05,047 --> 01:15:06,256
And we'll always stay with you."

708
01:15:08,091 --> 01:15:09,635
At some point, I couldn't resist anymore

709
01:15:13,263 --> 01:15:14,264
and allowed them in.

710
01:15:16,809 --> 01:15:19,186
The dreams started lasting for days.

711
01:15:20,270 --> 01:15:22,272
And then I woke up

712
01:15:23,273 --> 01:15:24,274
and saw their...

713
01:15:25,275 --> 01:15:26,276
real faces.

714
01:15:28,278 --> 01:15:30,280
And realized that I invited monsters.

715
01:15:38,121 --> 01:15:39,748
You never tried to run?

716
01:15:52,302 --> 01:15:53,303
I didn't want to.

717
01:16:48,358 --> 01:16:49,359
Damn.

718
01:16:55,115 --> 01:16:55,949
Katya?

719
01:17:08,378 --> 01:17:09,377
No,

720
01:17:09,379 --> 01:17:10,380
No!

721
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:11,441
Andrey!

722
01:19:14,713 --> 01:19:15,754
Katya, no!

723
01:19:15,756 --> 01:19:16,507
Sasha!

724
01:19:26,517 --> 01:19:27,350
Where's Sasha?

725
01:20:02,553 --> 01:20:04,555
We need to try to start the fire again!

726
01:20:06,557 --> 01:20:08,183
They're gonna kill us anyway!

727
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,353
They won't touch him. It's about us.

728
01:20:12,229 --> 01:20:13,564
They're gonna just keep killing.

729
01:20:15,566 --> 01:20:16,567
Am I wrong?

730
01:20:21,572 --> 01:20:22,656
Vadik, what are you doing?

731
01:20:26,201 --> 01:20:28,579
He said it, they depend only on him.

732
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:31,582
He goes, they go with him.

733
01:20:32,666 --> 01:20:34,585
Give me another idea!

734
01:20:38,589 --> 01:20:39,590
There is none.

735
01:20:41,592 --> 01:20:42,591
Lower the gun!

736
01:20:42,593 --> 01:20:43,594
Katya, he's right.

737
01:20:45,513 --> 01:20:46,597
I brought them here.

738
01:20:49,892 --> 01:20:51,143
They will leave with me.

739
01:20:56,607 --> 01:20:57,608
Katya, no!

740
01:20:59,610 --> 01:21:00,611
No, Katya!

741
01:21:14,625 --> 01:21:15,626
Run away!

742
01:21:17,628 --> 01:21:18,295
No!

743
01:21:19,630 --> 01:21:21,089
Don't repeat my mistakes.

744
01:21:23,634 --> 01:21:24,635
Let go.

745
01:21:32,643 --> 01:21:33,644
Take her out.

746
01:23:33,346 --> 01:23:34,347
What?

747
01:23:47,778 --> 01:23:48,779
Embrace me.

748
01:24:19,548 --> 01:24:24,548
