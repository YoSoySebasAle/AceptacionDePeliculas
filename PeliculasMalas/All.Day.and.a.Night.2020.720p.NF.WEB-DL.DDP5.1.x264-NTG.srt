- Come on.

15
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,333
Malcolm, stop.

16
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:47,416
Hey, now, you know you dealing with
a straight-laced young playa here, girl.

17
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:50,583
Mmm.

18
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:56,833
Mm-hmm. Yes, and I'm lovin' how you got
that ass shakin' from side to side

19
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,625
going up these stairs too, girl.

20
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:01,416
See, now you puttin' too much
on it, nigga. Chill.

21
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm about to put in some work
on that ass tonight.

22
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,250
- Shh.
- Come on now,

23
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,666
let's put her ass to sleep
before my dick stop workin'.

24
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,291
- Malcolm.
- You know I been drinking.

25
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,958
What you mean?
Don't tell me what to say, girl.

26
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:16,333
- Don't you tell me what to say.
- I want another one of those, okay?

27
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,767
- That's what you want, we can do that.
- Another one tonight.

28
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,375
- I'm with it.
- Mm-hmm.

29
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,208
So this...

30
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,291
You gonna rub my little girl out, dawg?

31
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:32,750
You here to rob me?

32
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:34,833
Take whatever you want.

33
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,541
Just let my lady and my little boo go.

34
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,333
You remember me, nigga?

35
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,375
Hell yeah. We folks, right?

36
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:50,916
Nah.

37
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,333
Your Honor, there are a number
of people who would like to speak

38
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:12,016
before you deliver the court's sentence.

39
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,708
The first is the mother
of one of the victims.

40
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:24,791
Thank you.

41
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,380
State your name, please,

I hope you rot in hell!

47
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,625
Two lives gone.

48
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,000
<i>And not one bit of remorse.</i>

49
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,250
My granddaughter is only ten years old.

50
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,500
For you to murder her peoples like that...

51
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,166
and for what?

52
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,708
You took away her whole family,

53
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:24,208
ain't never even given a reason why.

54
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,000
<i>That's all I want to know.</i>

55
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,041
Why?

56
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:32,166
Can you answer that?

57
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,083
<i>You say you knew my son-in-law,</i>

58
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,916
<i>but you won't say how.</i>

59
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,916
Malcolm ain't never mentioned you to me.

60
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,750
My daughter was all I had left.

61
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:58,416
The joys of motherhood have been
stolen away from me forever.

62
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,750
So if you have

63
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:05,916
any kind of justice...
...in your heart,

64
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,541
I beg that you don't never
let this monster out of jail again!

65
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,166
<i>People say they wanna know why.</i>

66
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:23,083
<i>But they really don't.</i>

67
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,166
<i>They want an easy answer.</i>

68
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,375
<i>If you had all day and a night</i>

69
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,208
<i>to understand your life...</i>

70
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,458
<i>where would you begin?</i>

71
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,666
<i>I see faces
of fathers from back home.</i>

72
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,625
<i>They just disappear.</i>

73
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,916
<i>And now I know where the fuck they went.</i>

74
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,666
That was the shit.

75
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:20,708
<i>Teenagers who were arrested

...drop of water and voila, bitch,

79
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:30,208
I had my rouge.

88
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,875
<i>I just couldn't see the walls.</i>

89
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:14,083
This yours?

90
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,458
Yeah. You can look at it if you want to.

91
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:18,416
Man, shut up.

92
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,916
Hey, yo, give me back my stuff.

93
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,416
Give it back, punk!

94
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Who hit you?

95
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,125
Nobody.

96
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:54,291
I fell.

97
00:09:56,916 --> 00:09:59,333
That's why I'm moving out the hood
when I get older.

98
00:10:00,375 --> 00:10:01,666

00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:15,833
Fuck you, nigga!

179
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,125
Who the fuck you think you're talking to?

180
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:24,375
Huh?

181
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,541
You ain't think your face
was gon' get busted, huh? Hmm?

182
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,500
Opening up your motherfuckin' mouth?

183
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:39,208
Threatenin' me?
I better already be dead, blood.

184
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:40,750
Got stomped out, nigga.

185
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,083
East Oakland, motherfucker.

186
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:55,916
Hey, Lamark.

187
00:14:58,291 --> 00:14:59,833
- Lamark?
- What?

188
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,666
How long you been back, man?

189
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,125
A week.

190
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,791
Yo, we ain't got no engineer,
producer in here?

191
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:08,750
It's cheaper this way.

192
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:13,500
This shit hard, right?

193
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:14,583
Hell yeah.

194
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,208
- Yo, ain't you supposed to be going back?
- Nah.

195
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,083
Just got discharged 'cause of my injury.

196
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:21,666
Still moving though.

197
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,351
Just waiting until I get better
and out of this chair again.

198
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,125
You're always trying to leave, man.

199
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:29,500
Everybody that go always comes back.
That's just wasted time.

200
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,708
That's not true.

201
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:32,208
It's a hundred percent true.

202
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,333
But check this out, man.

203
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:34,875
Shit.

204
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,333
Watch this.

205
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,583
All that shit.

Like this, what's here? Huh?

207
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:46,958
You don't want this?

208
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:48,625
You don't want it?

209
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:52,250
You know, on Grandmama's,
I'm about to be running shit anyway.

210
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,000
You already know.

211
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:58,041
Gotta dip downstairs right quick.

212
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,583
- All right.
- Hold it down.

213
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,500
T-Rex in the building, nigga.

214
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,875

He said you took care of something for us.

262
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,430
Shit, there go Malcolm people right there.

263
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,500
I'm hearing they got hella paper
on your head.

264
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,875
That's where we at.

265
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,125
You need shelter, come to Grandma house.

266
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,875
Stunna told me to tell you

267
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:33,041
your broad and your baby is doing cool.

268
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:37,041
You stay in the right lane,
and they'll always be taken care of.

269
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:40,791
Quiet-ass nigga.

270

<i>This nigga I rode the bus

00:19:58,166 --> 00:20:00,708
<i>how to take your fucked-up life
out on everybody else.</i>

276
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,291
Welcome to the yard, fish.

277
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:06,541
Don't.

278
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,416
They're just trying to bait you.

279
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:13,583
<i>And here I am.</i>

280
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,250
Come on, walk.

281
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,375
Make your next move your best move.

282
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,583
<i>Like walking in this nigga's
footsteps was for my own good.</i>

283

Hey, wait up. On the line.

286

All right, next.

287
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,125
Arms out.

288
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:43,666
That cat you was rapping with,
somebody you know from back home?

289
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,041
Come on, move up!

290
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,500
You can't survive on an island in here.

291
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,958
Gotta hop in the car with somebody.

292
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,458
Need to be smart though.

293
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,041
Nothing for free.

294
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,750
Spread 'em. Arms out.

295
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:09,583

Is that T-Rex in there?

357
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:37,958
In the flesh, baby doll.

358
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:39,500
How you feelin'?

359
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:42,208

366
00:26:28,458 --> 00:26:30,458
I'm a true-to-life capo, playboy.

367
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,416
Full-time hustler,

368
00:26:33,958 --> 00:26:35,208
part-time rapper.

369
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:39,708
Greatest trick the devil ever pulled,
believe that.

370
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:44,208
That little piece of work up there,

371
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:46,083
Nah.

00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:48,166
I'm fucking with a girl named Shantaye.

373
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,666

00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,666
She live in her cousin old house?

Had a Backpage ad for a minute
but never did no dates.

377
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:02,583
Yeah.

378
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:05,083
What, you know her or something?

379
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,166
Shit.

380
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,458
A lightweight.

381
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,916
Had a little episode in the past
back in the day.

382
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:17,541
She was a freak back then, bro.

383
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:19,833
Used to pop them pills and shit.

384
00:27:20,875 --> 00:27:21,916
Nigga...

00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,250
Letting niggas do all the camera work.

386
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:26,750
Shit was crazy.

387
00:27:28,375 --> 00:27:30,291
Nigga, you fucking up my high, bruh.

00:27:58,208 --> 00:27:59,833
<i>I met Shantaye at a sideshow.</i>

398
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:03,125
<i>She came up and sat next to me
on the hood of my Sentra...</i>

399
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:05,586
Why didn't you tell me

400
00:28:05,666 --> 00:28:08,986
<i>...then wouldn't hit me back for two weeks
'cause I pronounced her name "Chantelle."</i>

401
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:11,500
<i>She said if it was important enough,</i>

402
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:13,208
<i>I would have remembered.</i>

403
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:50,750
I've got something to tell you.

404
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:00,791

00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:45,958
<i>It's crazy...</i>

00:30:46,541 --> 00:30:47,875
<i>to have nothing to give...</i>

431
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:51,208
<i>and wanna give everything.</i>

432
00:30:57,375 --> 00:31:00,791
<i>Thanks for calling, but we
aren't looking to fill any positions.</i>

433
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:03,675
<i>Wish I could help you out.
We don't have anything available, bro.</i>

439
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,416
<i>You hit the jackpot, bro.</i>

440
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,041
<i>Somebody just quit.
You wanna talk to the manager?</i>

<i>But that ain't the case.</i>

Hmm.

00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:15,916
I'm talkin' even the craziest shit

464
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,750
don't got shit on what happens overseas.

465
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:19,708
It's desperate out there.

466
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:22,416
Yeah, nigga,
like it's not desperate over here?

467
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,625
That's facts.

468
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:28,958
Hey, how your mom though?

469
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
She cool.

00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:33,791
What's up with JD?

471
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:36,833
He ain't ever getting out. And...

472
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:40,541
I ain't heard from him.

473
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,333
Hey, nigga...

474
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:49,833

477
00:32:57,625 --> 00:32:59,458
- What?
- Yeah, nigga.

478
00:32:59,541 --> 00:33:00,750
Say you swear.

479
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:02,875
Bruh, I swear, bruh.

480
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:04,250

481
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:05,791
Wait, when? What?

482
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,083
I don't know,

483
00:33:09,916 --> 00:33:11,583
Like, it won't be here in a minute.

484
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:12,750
Oh, man.

485
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:15,875
No, but your ass should be back
hitting corners in no time, nigga.

486
00:33:16,666 --> 00:33:17,916
Back up and kickin'.

487
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,133
I gotta have a couple operations

488
00:33:23,625 --> 00:33:24,625
Just found out.

489
00:33:25,375 --> 00:33:26,375
Operations?

490
00:33:26,791 --> 00:33:29,250
Hey, man, don't even
be worrying about me. Feel me?

491
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:32,708
Just a couple burns
on the back of my legs,

492
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:33,791
you know.

493
00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:37,291
IED got us. Whatever.

494
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,250
It's nothing.

495
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:42,708
Hey.

496
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:45,458
Hey, stop looking all mad, fool.

497
00:33:47,041 --> 00:33:49,166
Hey, I'm proud of myself.

498
00:33:51,166 --> 00:33:53,000
I was protecting what we got here at home.

499
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,041
So smile, nigga.

00:33:58,791 --> 00:34:01,625
'Bout to be a dad.
Congratulations.

501
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:02,750
Respect, bro.

502
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:06,875
I'm about to be an uncle, nigga?

503
00:34:07,833 --> 00:34:09,750
- Aw, yeah, bruh.

504
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:12,333
Basically. Basically.

Shit.

506
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:16,958
Yeah, life up in here is... shit.

507
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,666
It is what it is, you know?

508
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:23,375
I've been, uh...

509
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:29,000
I've been thinking a lot.

510
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:37,000
It ain't shit really else to do in here.

511
00:34:37,083 --> 00:34:38,083
But, uh...

512
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:42,166
Hey, listen up.

513
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:44,916
I know you was planning on coming up here.

514
00:34:49,416 --> 00:34:51,125
Taye, I don't want you to bring the baby.

515
00:34:53,166 --> 00:34:54,875
I'm not who he should be looking up to.

516
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:02,750
Baby, Taye...

517
00:35:04,458 --> 00:35:05,958
Yo, just listen to me, all right?

518
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,250
Don't bring him up here.

519
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:12,625
Hello?

520
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,208
- Grab that card, boy.
- He wants you to work, man.

521
00:35:34,291 --> 00:35:35,458
He did that shit on purpose.

522
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:02,058
This dumbass got suspended
for beating up that boy.

523
00:36:02,083 --> 00:36:03,416
And listening to you.

524
00:36:13,916 --> 00:36:16,316
I have to do shit
'cause you ain't gon' do it!

I got to be the mama
and the motherfuckin' daddy around here!

526
00:36:19,416 --> 00:36:21,166

00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:28,750
- Fuck a light!
- Yeah, fuck a light!

530
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:31,333
'Cause you ain't got
to be here with him! I do!

531
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:34,208
What happens when he gets sick, JD?

532
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:37,000
We can't even fuckin'
give him lunch money.

533
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:38,166
Fuckin' lunch money!

534
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,184
- I said I'm tryin', all right?
- Yeah, you tryin'.

535
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:44,166
A real fuckin' man would take care
of his goddamn family.

536
00:36:44,958 --> 00:36:47,666
Not fucking snortin' that shit.
Don't you...

537
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,041
Watch the way you fuckin' talk to me,
you hear me?

538
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,458
- Get the fuck off me.
- I ain't getting the fuck nowhere!

539
00:36:53,666 --> 00:36:54,666
You hear me?

540
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,500
You ain't hear?

541
00:36:58,625 --> 00:37:01,250
You act like some little lunch money
gonna change something

542
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:02,916
at that bullshit-ass school.

543
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:05,708
Make them garbage-ass teachers
give a damn.

544
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:07,111
Like he hella smart or some shit.

545
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:09,833
He ain't no smarter than nobody else
around this motherfucker.

546
00:37:11,958 --> 00:37:13,838
And just like all them other niggas
around here,

547
00:37:14,291 --> 00:37:16,458
he ain't gonna do nothing
but end up just like me.

548
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,875
Trying to make it the best he can.

549
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:22,416
My son won't be nothing like you.

550
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:25,875
Jah!

551
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:28,125
Come on, man.

552
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:29,458
Let's ride.

553
00:37:29,916 --> 00:37:31,666
Get the fuck up outta here!

554
00:37:46,541 --> 00:37:48,291
You stayin' out of trouble?

555
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:05,791
Hey.

556
00:38:07,375 --> 00:38:09,708
Well, you done did it this time
with your dumb ass.

557
00:38:11,291 --> 00:38:12,666
Fucked your whole life up.

558
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,625
You ain't gon' say nothin'?

559
00:38:18,708 --> 00:38:20,166
Like why you did this shit?

560
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:26,583
I can't believe you always
gotta act like this, Jah.

561
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:29,208
You gonna have to say something.

562
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:30,333
I'm here.

563
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:32,458
I ain't got nothin' to say to you.

564
00:38:32,958 --> 00:38:34,750
I don't even know
why you in here to see me.

565
00:38:34,833 --> 00:38:36,500
I'm here 'cause you're my son.

566
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:40,833
You are my son, Jahkor,
whether you like it or not.

567
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:43,416
Me and JD are the ones God gave you.

568
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,375
You can't blame all this on me.

569
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:53,875
We didn't do everything right.

570
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,750
And I take responsibility for that.

571
00:38:58,583 --> 00:39:00,291
But all this can't be my fault.

572
00:39:01,708 --> 00:39:02,708
All this?

573
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:12,000
There's a lot of shit we did wrong.

574
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:17,875
For bringing you into this world.

575
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:28,625
I'm not...

576
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,541
in here...

577
00:39:31,541 --> 00:39:32,791
because of you, Mama.

578
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:36,458
The reason I'm here...

579
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,500
is inside these walls...

580
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:40,166
with me.

581
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:41,625
So go.

582
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:44,916
Wait.

583
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:46,375
Jah.

584
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,416
You're wrong about your father.

585
00:40:03,833 --> 00:40:05,750
I'm sorry we couldn't do better.

586
00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:08,291
But he did want a good life for you.

587
00:40:10,916 --> 00:40:13,416
JD wanted everything for you.

588
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:24,375
He ain't even know
why he was livin' most of the time.

589
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:31,000
He gave up on hisself
'cause he felt like he failed you.

590
00:40:31,416 --> 00:40:35,291
And now, you have a son,
and you ain't even gon' try?

591
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,875
What you gon' be to that boy?

592
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:42,000

Let me get that one more time.

617
00:42:17,166 --> 00:42:18,166
All right, babe.

618
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:42,291
What are you doing?

619
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:49,458
Where's the salesperson?

620
00:42:56,166 --> 00:42:57,166

I went out the other night
with this chick, bro.

629
00:43:20,208 --> 00:43:23,875
You need some hoes,
I got those too, straight from Mexico.

<i>You ain't goin' to his birthday shit?</i>

638
00:43:43,125 --> 00:43:45,791
You need to try to pop that nigga

639
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,500
No.

640
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:49,250
As many times as possible.

641
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:52,125
You shouldn't go neither.
It ain't gonna be all that, trust me.

Damn.

648

715
00:50:48,916 --> 00:50:51,666
<i>And Delanda got hella hot about it.</i>

00:50:52,166 --> 00:50:53,916
<i>She made me send that picture.</i>

00:50:55,666 --> 00:50:57,541
<i>I'll bring you some of Zion when I come.</i>

00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:45,708

728
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,416
Not knowing what it look like,
stuff like that?

729
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,458

00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:02,416
They'll let him come up.

731
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,083
But I wouldn't do it.

732
00:53:06,125 --> 00:53:07,583
Let his mother take care of it.

733
00:53:08,208 --> 00:53:09,958

in a class that should
only have 20 students.

01:00:31,458 --> 01:00:33,583
Just another day in Cokeland, nigga.
Waitin' on you.

879
01:00:34,083 --> 01:00:35,916
Man, I'm going to the studio
later today, man.

880
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,500
Tryin' to go to the stratosphere
with his next album.

881
01:00:38,583 --> 01:00:40,916
You feel me?
I'm doing it all independent, shining.

882
01:00:41,416 --> 01:00:42,750
Feel me? Keepin' it a hundred.

883
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:45,458
But the real thing though?
That shit looking good, man.

884
01:00:45,916 --> 01:00:48,083
Ready for you to step in
as soon as the way clear.

885
01:00:48,166 --> 01:00:49,166
That's what's up.

886
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,125
What's wrong, man? We good?

887
01:00:56,791 --> 01:00:57,791
Yeah.

888
01:01:08,416 --> 01:01:09,666
Man, fuck, bruh.

889
01:01:11,083 --> 01:01:13,041
I can't fucking stand that fuckin' nigga.

890
01:01:15,166 --> 01:01:17,416
- Hey, let me use your bike right quick.
- For what?

891
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:34,041
What the fuck, Jah?

892
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:35,833
What is you doin'?

893
01:02:35,916 --> 01:02:38,125
I came here to grab
all my motherfuckin' shit.

894
01:02:38,208 --> 01:02:39,833
Why, nigga? What happened?

895
01:02:39,916 --> 01:02:40,750
What happened?

896
01:02:40,833 --> 01:02:43,833
- T-Rex happened, Taye.
- T-Rex? I don't know what the fuck

897
01:02:43,916 --> 01:02:46,416
- you talkin' about.
- I'm talking about that nigga

898
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:50,208
showing motherfuckers a video
of you fucking other niggas, Taye.

899
01:02:50,291 --> 01:02:52,250
Plural. Niggas.

900
01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:53,933
That was after my brother got shot, Jah.

901
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,125
Oh, fuckin' miss me.

902
01:02:55,208 --> 01:02:57,291
I told you I acted wild then.
I didn't know you then.

903
01:02:57,375 --> 01:02:59,175
- Miss me with that shit!
- I didn't know you.

904
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:02,208
I don't give a fuck about none
of that fuckin' shit, a'ight?

905
01:03:03,458 --> 01:03:05,875
I don't want my baby mama
being a goddamn ho!

906
01:03:05,958 --> 01:03:07,291
Fuck you, Jahkor!

907
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:09,623
'Cause me and this baby
gon' be straight regardless.

908
01:03:09,666 --> 01:03:11,500
All 'cause your motherfuckin'
pride is hurt.

909
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:12,625
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

910
01:03:12,708 --> 01:03:13,708
- Yeah, all right.
- Yeah.

911
01:03:13,791 --> 01:03:16,416
And you can take your motherfuckin' ass
in the fuckin' house,

912
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,375
go your ass inside
of the fucking house,

913
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:21,791
grab my motherfuckin' shit,
and bring my motherfuckin' car keys.

914
01:03:22,625 --> 01:03:24,916
- Go get my fuckin' car keys!
- I'm getting them!

915
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,708
I'm getting your fuckin' keys, nigga!

916
01:03:29,541 --> 01:03:30,541
Yeah, a'ight.

917
01:03:34,166 --> 01:03:35,916
Take your keys, nigga!

918
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,333
'Cause I've been takin'
the motherfuckin' bus.

919
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:42,416
And you know what?
You ain't nothin' but a hypocrite.

920
01:03:42,541 --> 01:03:44,875
- 'Cause I know you been cheating on me.
- Come on, babies.

921
01:03:44,958 --> 01:03:47,517
I know you been cheatin' on me,
and I ain't done shit with nobody!

922
01:03:47,541 --> 01:03:48,666
Know what, Taye?

923
01:03:49,833 --> 01:03:50,833
If I did...

924
01:03:51,708 --> 01:03:54,791
it's because I never trusted
your motherfuckin' ass in the first place.

925
01:03:55,416 --> 01:03:56,416
I mean,

926
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,208
how you expect me
to be faithful to a goddamn ho?

927
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:02,333
Fuck you, Jahkor.

928
01:04:03,916 --> 01:04:06,833
- Yeah, a'ight.
- Yeah, because I loved you, that's how.

929
01:04:07,875 --> 01:04:10,250
And that's all that should
motherfuckin' matter!

930
01:05:23,125 --> 01:05:24,208
<i>It's like...</i>

931
01:05:24,958 --> 01:05:26,125
<i>a million tiny cuts...</i>

932
01:05:27,416 --> 01:05:29,583
<i>that don't seem to matter
until you realize...</i>

933
01:05:29,666 --> 01:05:32,184
- I ain't being racist either.
<i>- ...your ass is bleeding to death.</i>

934
01:05:32,208 --> 01:05:35,041
I'm just tired of people like Jah

935
01:05:35,375 --> 01:05:37,291
acting like bein' gangsta
about your shit

936
01:05:37,375 --> 01:05:38,583
is just a black thing.

937
01:05:39,541 --> 01:05:40,583
'Cause all I do...

938
01:05:41,416 --> 01:05:43,833
all I do is ride

939
01:05:43,916 --> 01:05:45,041
and keep it lit.

940
01:05:45,625 --> 01:05:48,916
A'ight, a bitch like me don't even fuck
with nobody that ain't gangsta.

941
01:05:49,958 --> 01:05:51,666
See, my nigga a fucking D-boy.

942
01:05:52,416 --> 01:05:53,541
Moving zips...

943
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,166
sippin' codeine.

944
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:56,250
All that.

945
01:05:56,875 --> 01:05:58,125
So I don't give a fuck.

946
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,375
I'm a down-ass ratchet bitch.
A'ight, I...

947
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:03,500
I bleed this shit
with ten toes down in it.

948
01:06:15,791 --> 01:06:17,583
Follow that motherfucker right there.

949
01:06:18,125 --> 01:06:19,125
It lit?

950
01:06:21,291 --> 01:06:22,875
About to get some rims, nigga.

951
01:06:24,833 --> 01:06:26,083
- Say "lit."
- Easy mark.

952
01:06:54,541 --> 01:06:56,083
Police everywhere, nigga.

953
01:06:56,583 --> 01:06:58,041
Today ain't gon' be my day, Jah.

954
01:06:58,125 --> 01:07:00,250
I ain't going to jail off no bullshit.

955
01:07:00,958 --> 01:07:03,250
Bruh, we on one way the fuck out here.

956
01:07:03,833 --> 01:07:05,916
I'm about to bounce
back to the crib, nigga.

957
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:10,333
This is fuckin' ridiculous.

958
01:07:12,166 --> 01:07:13,541
Talkin' all that shit.

959
01:07:15,333 --> 01:07:16,958
And livin' all the way out here.

960
01:07:19,791 --> 01:07:23,166
White people get on my fuckin' nerves.

961
01:07:23,791 --> 01:07:24,875
Why?

962
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:27,916
Why does what some white bitch
do even matter?

963
01:07:29,541 --> 01:07:30,625
Hmm?

964
01:07:30,708 --> 01:07:32,416
Why do anybody matter?

965
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:34,583
If all you gonna do
is react to other people,

966
01:07:35,041 --> 01:07:37,708
what they say, what they think of you,
and what they do,

967
01:07:37,791 --> 01:07:39,541
then you ain't shit but they puppet.

968
01:07:41,375 --> 01:07:43,175
'Cause I could give a fuck
about white people.

969
01:07:44,708 --> 01:07:46,166
I'm a predator, nigga.

970
01:07:47,625 --> 01:07:48,875
All that matters is me.

971
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:51,708
You need to open up your eyes, cuddie.

972
01:07:52,833 --> 01:07:54,375
'Cause that's the American way.

973
01:07:58,916 --> 01:08:00,625
Damn.

974
01:08:08,458 --> 01:08:11,583
<i>Do you ever notice how police act
just like they do on TV?</i>

975
01:08:16,416 --> 01:08:18,736
<i>It's like they watch that shit
just to see what to be like.</i>

976
01:08:26,708 --> 01:08:29,125
So what were you doing
in a neighborhood like Blackhawk?

977
01:08:33,916 --> 01:08:35,333
You sure you want to play dumb?

978
01:08:36,708 --> 01:08:38,291
Now, come on, Jah,

979
01:08:38,375 --> 01:08:41,791
you and your ace motherfucka,
Anthony McFadden,

980
01:08:41,875 --> 01:08:43,916
a.k.a. TQ the dope dealer.

981
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:45,960
Oh, you didn't realize
we knew about him, did you?

982
01:08:47,333 --> 01:08:50,208
Damn, if we didn't find a brick
of that white girl in his truck.

983
01:08:51,166 --> 01:08:52,875
Cocaine. Yeah.

984
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:55,458
That's ten years, Jah.

985
01:08:55,541 --> 01:08:56,875
He don't want to do that bid.

986
01:08:57,625 --> 01:08:59,666
So, Q...

987
01:09:02,291 --> 01:09:03,708
That's what I like to call him.

988
01:09:03,791 --> 01:09:07,375
Y'all usually got people on the other side
of this watching me and shit, right?

989
01:09:07,458 --> 01:09:08,625
Says you work for Stunna.

990
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:11,291
See what we got here.

991
01:09:14,958 --> 01:09:17,375
You've already pled down
an armed robbery.

992
01:09:18,416 --> 01:09:21,083
Robbing a liquor store, resisting arrest,

993
01:09:21,166 --> 01:09:22,291
home invasion.

994
01:09:25,833 --> 01:09:27,291
Juvenile report.

995
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,375
Your father's serving life?

996
01:09:34,666 --> 01:09:35,708
Says he, uh...

997
01:09:36,916 --> 01:09:38,916
spent a couple months in the psych ward.

998
01:09:42,208 --> 01:09:43,500
He's a dope head.

999
01:09:46,708 --> 01:09:47,708
Is it genetic?

1000
01:09:49,583 --> 01:09:50,583
Genetic?

1001
01:09:52,583 --> 01:09:53,583
Dope?

1002
01:09:54,833 --> 01:09:55,833
Nah.

1003
01:09:56,791 --> 01:09:57,875
It ain't.

1004
01:09:57,958 --> 01:09:58,958
Doesn't matter.

1005
01:10:00,208 --> 01:10:01,648
Want me to call your parole officer?

1006
01:10:01,708 --> 01:10:04,267
Don't let me find out that you missed
an appointment, lost a job...

1007
01:10:04,291 --> 01:10:06,331
This is some fuckin' bullshit,
and you know it, man!

1008
01:10:06,833 --> 01:10:08,673
I don't know why the fuck
I'm up in here, bruh!

1009
01:10:08,708 --> 01:10:11,541
I want to believe you, Jah, I do. I do.

1010
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:13,105
But you gotta give me something here.

1011
01:10:15,625 --> 01:10:16,625
You know, just...

1012
01:10:17,708 --> 01:10:19,666
something I can use, just some...

1013
01:10:20,166 --> 01:10:21,875
fuckin' information, man, just...

1014
01:10:26,541 --> 01:10:29,958
What about that turf war that's brewing
between Malcolm and Stunna?

1015
01:10:30,458 --> 01:10:32,739
- Can you talk about that?
- I don't know shit about that.

1016
01:10:32,791 --> 01:10:36,541
Come on, you must know something.
You roll with TQ, right?

1017
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:38,690
Is it true he's working with Malcolm

1018
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:41,166
to unify the organizations
behind Stunna's back?

1019
01:10:41,916 --> 01:10:43,125
Hmm?

1020
01:10:43,208 --> 01:10:45,125
You know, Malcolm's been around
a long time.

1021
01:10:45,208 --> 01:10:46,208
He's a big fish.

1022
01:10:50,916 --> 01:10:51,916
Like I said...

1023
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:55,625
I don't know no niggas...

1024
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,000
named Malcolm.

1025
01:10:59,416 --> 01:11:00,458
Or Stunna.

1026
01:11:06,166 --> 01:11:08,447
<i>They pick you up for anything
when you on parole.</i>

1027
01:11:09,041 --> 01:11:10,958
<i>TQ never carried dope in his whip.</i>

1028
01:11:20,208 --> 01:11:21,791
You need to get rid of that old thing.

1029
01:11:24,458 --> 01:11:26,538
D'you bring that money
like I asked for them tickets?

1030
01:11:27,125 --> 01:11:28,125
Ray Ray got it.

1031
01:11:28,583 --> 01:11:29,833
Who the fuck is Ray Ray?

1032
01:11:29,916 --> 01:11:31,083
My new man.

1033
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:39,375
- Ey, what's up, young playa?
- What up, bruh?

1034
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:43,916
- Yo, how much was that shit?
- Nah, don't worry about it.

1035
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,208
- Do anything for your mama.
- Say thank you.

1036
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:47,500
Yeah, a'ight.

1037
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:53,458
Where we taking you?

1038
01:11:54,375 --> 01:11:55,583
Got my car over there...

1039
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:57,250
in the east.

1040
01:11:58,583 --> 01:12:01,750
Boy, I'm not even gon' ask you
why you was all way out in Blackhawk

1041
01:12:01,833 --> 01:12:03,250
around all them white people.

1042
01:12:04,125 --> 01:12:06,041
Just hope you breaking her for some money.

1043
01:12:06,125 --> 01:12:07,583
- It ain't even like that.
- Okay.

1044
01:12:07,666 --> 01:12:09,333
So you like them white girls, huh?

1045
01:12:11,333 --> 01:12:13,208
- Wassup?
- You ain't gotta front, young blood.

1046
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:16,666
I see a bunch of you youngsters
out there running with them pale faces.

1047
01:12:17,916 --> 01:12:20,291
- Hey, nigga, you don't fuckin' know me.

You wanna come around, walkin' around

1170
01:21:35,708 --> 01:21:37,500
You know a cat named Q?

1171

People chirpin' about a TQ

1172
01:21:47,333 --> 01:21:48,791

And them screws don't wanna

Everybody know somebody
coming for you, but I got your back.

1176
01:22:01,666 --> 01:22:04,125
Don't trust nobody TQ send your way.

1177
01:22:06,916 --> 01:22:08,333
They give you a celly yet?

1178
01:22:11,541 --> 01:22:12,541
Nah.

1179
01:22:12,916 --> 01:22:14,916
That's 'cause they want you alone.

1180
01:22:16,833 --> 01:22:17,875
Vulnerable.

1181
01:22:17,958 --> 01:22:20,083
You ain't gotta be worrying
about all that.

1182
01:22:23,291 --> 01:22:24,291
I got me.

1183
01:22:25,791 --> 01:22:26,791
A'ight?

1184
01:22:26,958 --> 01:22:28,958
You need to stick with me, young'un.

1185
01:22:29,875 --> 01:22:30,875
In here...

1186
01:22:31,833 --> 01:22:34,125
ain't nothin' what it seems.

1187
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:39,291
These niggas don't need a reason in here.

1188
01:22:41,458 --> 01:22:43,291
And just like on the outside...

1189
01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:45,875
they'll kill you without a second thought

1190
01:22:45,958 --> 01:22:47,583
if they can get something out of it.

1191
01:22:50,416 --> 01:22:52,500
They're holding something over that nigga.

1192
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Either he help them get to you,
or they gonna out him to his own people.

1193
01:22:59,583 --> 01:23:00,583
You hear me?

1194
01:23:03,125 --> 01:23:04,125
Yeah.

1195
01:24:52,208 --> 01:24:53,666
So, how is he, uh...

1196
01:24:56,750 --> 01:24:57,750
How's he doin'?

1197
01:24:58,625 --> 01:25:00,291
I...

1198
01:25:00,666 --> 01:25:01,666
What?

1199
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:07,750
The military ruined him, Jahkor.

1200
01:25:08,416 --> 01:25:09,416
They did.

1201
01:25:11,125 --> 01:25:13,750
The doctors say
that he'll never walk again.

1202
01:25:16,916 --> 01:25:18,041
I hate the Army.

1203
01:25:19,125 --> 01:25:21,208
I don't get why they even sent him there.

1204
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:29,750
No.

1205
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:34,000
It ain't fair.

1206
01:25:35,333 --> 01:25:36,333
He did...

1207
01:25:37,708 --> 01:25:38,916
He did everything right.

1208
01:25:40,208 --> 01:25:41,208
Jah.

1209
01:25:41,625 --> 01:25:43,708
Everything. Everything right.

1210
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:48,875
It ain't fair.

1211
01:25:50,333 --> 01:25:52,708
Nigga, who the fuck you is?
Motherfucker talkin' crazy.

1212
01:25:52,791 --> 01:25:54,833
I want my motherfuckin' money now,
nigga, period!

1213
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:58,041
Ey, I only look this way, boy.

1214
01:25:58,125 --> 01:26:00,291
Trust it, I will fuck you up.

1215
01:26:00,375 --> 01:26:03,250
Believe me when I tell you
I'm strictly 'bout this business.

1216
01:26:03,333 --> 01:26:04,333
Huh?

1217
01:26:04,666 --> 01:26:07,458
Nigga, I don't wanna hear that shit!

They don't wait on no money.
You gotta pay them on time, feel me?

1248
01:30:17,333 --> 01:30:19,726
They don't want

1249
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:21,833
