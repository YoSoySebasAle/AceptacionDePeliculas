My short time on the
other side,

1098
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:29,921
taught me that we need to learn
to live in harmony.

1099
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:35,218
No just with ourselves, but
with the entire universe.

1100
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:37,637
They returned to their planet,

1101

search the stars wondering where
she might be in one of them.

1105
01:23:53,945 --> 01:23:56,031
We learned the value of peace.

her face would fade,

1107
01:24:00,076 --> 01:24:03,621

she had brought with her.
