1
00:01:14,264 --> 00:01:15,431
Mom?

2
00:01:17,475 --> 00:01:18,726
Mommy?

3
00:01:21,104 --> 00:01:23,065
Mommy!

4
00:01:25,707 --> 00:01:26,708
Are you okay?

5
00:01:27,861 --> 00:01:30,156
No. I'm scared.

6
00:01:36,537 --> 00:01:38,079
It's just thunder, sweetie.

7
00:01:38,204 --> 00:01:40,416
I know. I'm scared of thunder.

8
00:01:44,053 --> 00:01:45,880
Can I sleep with you tonight?

9
00:01:46,404 --> 00:01:47,548
You're almost six, Billy.

10
00:01:48,256 --> 00:01:51,017
I think it's really important that you
learn to sleep in your own bed.

11
00:01:51,982 --> 00:01:54,180
Even when it's thunder and lightning?

12
00:01:55,556 --> 00:01:57,266
Even when it's thunder and lightning.

13
00:01:57,766 --> 00:01:58,767
But mom...

14
00:01:58,996 --> 00:02:00,081
But what?

15
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:03,522
They come for me when it's dark.

16
00:02:04,982 --> 00:02:07,959
Honey, nobody's coming for you.

17
00:02:09,361 --> 00:02:11,739
Except maybe me
if you don't go to sleep.

18
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:13,199
Okay?

19
00:02:13,553 --> 00:02:15,326
Okay. Check first?

20
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:17,562
Yes sir.

21
00:02:27,102 --> 00:02:28,103
Do you want to look?

22
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:31,676
Daddy and I are right downstairs.

23
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,154
If you pull the covers over your head,

24
00:02:34,178 --> 00:02:35,347
you're safe, right?

25
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:36,765
Right.

26
00:02:37,307 --> 00:02:38,642
Okay.

27
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,959
I'll leave the door open a crack, okay?

28
00:02:49,724 --> 00:02:50,724
Okay.

29
00:04:00,093 --> 00:04:01,094
Mom?

30
00:04:02,498 --> 00:04:03,499
Mommy?

31
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:49,606
Mommy!

32
00:06:54,943 --> 00:06:57,448
<i>It's mom. I'm not going to
make my Friday visit, but honey...</i>

33
00:06:57,907 --> 00:06:58,908
What else is new?

34
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:00,855
<i>You got to keep up
with those pills.</i>

35
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,185
Yes mother.

36
00:07:02,443 --> 00:07:04,055
<i>Julia, hi, Doctor Crowley.</i>

37
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,475
<i>The thirteenth's fine
for your thesis defense.</i>

38
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:07,967
<i>Say nine a. M.</i>

39
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,936
<i>I'll let Professor Essex know.</i>

40
00:07:10,384 --> 00:07:12,568
<i>Please confirm as soon as you can.
Thanks.</i>

41
00:07:12,942 --> 00:07:15,146
<i>Jules, take off the bike shorts and
listen to me...</i>

42
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,902
<i>The ambulance threw a rod
so I'm switching shifts</i>

43
00:07:16,926 --> 00:07:18,631
<i>and I got the night off,
are you free?</i>

44
00:07:20,138 --> 00:07:21,139
<i>Julia, it's Kim.</i>

45
00:07:21,221 --> 00:07:25,217
<i>Join us here in
the 21st century, huh, get e-mail.</i>

46
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,771
I hate e-mail.

47
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,912
<i>Think of it as an actual "date".</i>

48
00:07:32,037 --> 00:07:33,137
<i>Foreign concept, I know,</i>

49
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:35,404
<i>but a break just
might free your fevered mind.</i>

50
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:37,998
I can't go out tonight,
I have to study.

51
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,553
<i>And don't say "I can't go
out tonight, I have to study."</i>

52
00:07:40,984 --> 00:07:42,144
<i>I'm picking you up at eight.</i>

53
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,424
<i>You've done a year of research.</i>

54
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:45,670
Presented your thesis...

55
00:07:46,084 --> 00:07:47,701
So all that's left's the defense, right?

56
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,810
Hmm hmm. Then I've got my Masters.

57
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,529
Great.
Then you can psychoanalyze me.

58
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,771
Well, I can do that now.

59
00:07:55,248 --> 00:07:57,646
C'mon, give me credit
for being a little mysterious.

60
00:07:59,123 --> 00:08:01,662
Raised by puritanical
Midwestern parents,

61
00:08:02,295 --> 00:08:03,998
you are hardworking,

62
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:06,943
honest to a fault,

63
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:10,472
and very, very empathetic.

64
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:19,051
Okay, my turn.

65
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:23,185
Raised by an overbearing mother,

66
00:08:23,857 --> 00:08:26,826
you're passionate,
driven, maybe to a fault,

67
00:08:27,271 --> 00:08:28,709
and just a little bit moody.

68
00:08:29,807 --> 00:08:30,892
Moody?

69
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:32,867
The highs are high, the lows are low.

70
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:34,516
It means you feel.

71
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,209
That's a good thing. Trust me.
That's why we're good together.

72
00:08:39,325 --> 00:08:40,409
Body and soul.

73
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,271
Playing a good game of pool is a sign
of being well-rounded, you know.

74
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:47,709
- Says who?
- Some dead English guy.

75
00:08:52,295 --> 00:08:54,967
What do you want me to say?
I'm feeling it.

76
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,795
Let's see if you "feel it"
when something's riding on it.

77
00:09:00,045 --> 00:09:03,443
- Twenty's yours if you sink it.
- Alright.

78
00:09:07,474 --> 00:09:08,558
No pressure.

79
00:09:10,688 --> 00:09:11,689
Oh.

80
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:14,519
One more time.
Double or nothing.

81
00:09:15,489 --> 00:09:19,785
- Driven to a fault, remember?
- It's your money.

82
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:22,538
Alright. Here we go.

83
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:48,732
<i>Steadfast
in their stance on the issue.</i>

84
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,615
<i>Earlier this week
civic government announced...</i>

85
00:09:51,693 --> 00:09:53,646
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

86
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:56,310
Uh... Sorry we're home.

87
00:09:57,783 --> 00:10:00,160
We were just - actually - uh...

88
00:10:00,951 --> 00:10:03,160
Reese kind of flaked on us
so we decided to be domestic.

89
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,881
<i>Power crises intensify,</i>

90
00:10:04,931 --> 00:10:09,342
<i>the specter of rolling blackouts
goes from threat to reality.</i>

91
00:10:10,053 --> 00:10:11,997
Speaking of,
you guys pay the electric bill?

92
00:10:12,022 --> 00:10:13,782
<i>Tragedy struck
a downtown warehouse today...</i>

93
00:10:13,816 --> 00:10:17,951
- Well, Paul, you see there isn't...
- Come on.

94
00:10:18,037 --> 00:10:20,762
You know what?
We were thinking, like,

95
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,492
why should we pay for something
we're not even going to get, right?

96
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:25,842
You got fired again.

97
00:10:27,488 --> 00:10:28,489
Yeah.

98
00:10:28,514 --> 00:10:30,803
So you don't mind
fronting us again, right?

99
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:33,954
Just, like, until I get back on my
feet, man, I swear to God...

100
00:10:33,979 --> 00:10:35,592
It won't be long.

101
00:10:38,021 --> 00:10:40,600
Anyone comes
in my room, they're dead.

102
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,322
You got it, man, you got it.

103
00:10:44,347 --> 00:10:47,183
- That's what I'm talking about...
- It's not my fault.

104
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,100
Alone at last.

105
00:11:32,045 --> 00:11:35,068
- You gonna get that?
- I have to... It could be Crowley.

106
00:11:35,498 --> 00:11:38,235
- On a Friday night?
- I paged him.

107
00:11:42,282 --> 00:11:43,443
Hello?

108
00:11:45,319 --> 00:11:47,100
Billy. Hey.

109
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:50,990
What's wrong?

110
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,600
I can't leave right now.

111
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:05,482
I'm kind of in the middle of something.
I could see you tomorrow.

112
00:12:10,971 --> 00:12:14,100
Um... Okay.
I'll come and meet you.

113
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:17,150
Hmm hmm.

114
00:12:17,942 --> 00:12:19,701
I'll be there in a half hour.

115
00:12:20,695 --> 00:12:22,350
Okay. Bye.

116
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,639
- What now?
- He didn't say.

117
00:12:27,032 --> 00:12:29,868
- But he sounded terrible.
- He always sounds terrible.

118
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:33,717
- The guy's permanently freaked out.
- You know the shit he's been through.

119
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,628
Yeah, well, who hasn't?

120
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,173
Look, I know you guys are close,
and I'm cool with that,

121
00:12:40,698 --> 00:12:43,131
even if you have known him
since you were, like, five.

122
00:12:44,302 --> 00:12:46,742
But you can only expect so
much understanding from one mortal.

123
00:12:48,598 --> 00:12:50,309
But you're not just any mortal.

124
00:12:57,149 --> 00:12:58,400
I won't be long.

125
00:13:56,709 --> 00:13:57,740
Julia?

126
00:14:05,748 --> 00:14:06,749
Billy?

127
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,974
My god, I almost didn't recognize you.

128
00:14:21,623 --> 00:14:25,031
- What's wrong?
- I look bad, huh?

129
00:14:26,646 --> 00:14:30,217
Terrible.
What happened to your hand?

130
00:14:30,842 --> 00:14:35,560
- It's... It's hard to explain.
- Try.

131
00:14:37,975 --> 00:14:40,881
- They're here!
- Who?

132
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:43,857
Billy, it's just
a power surge from the storm.

133
00:14:44,813 --> 00:14:45,898
No, it's not.

134
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,221
Listen to me...

135
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,537
You remember those night terrors
that we used to have?

136
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:52,373
What, when we were kids?

137
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:55,490
That's when they marked us.
And now they're back.

138
00:14:55,954 --> 00:14:56,955
Who?

139
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,092
- You see that?
- What?

140
00:15:03,271 --> 00:15:06,590
Listen to me: When you hear a baby
crying, or you hear a kid crying

141
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:10,201
you keep moving, okay? Children
can sense them. It's your warning.

142
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:13,350
- Warning against what?
- Also, they affect the electrical things.

143
00:15:13,482 --> 00:15:17,310
They affect the lights and the
phones. They... They affect things.

144
00:15:17,428 --> 00:15:20,107
Billy, stop!!
You're not making sense.

145
00:15:20,404 --> 00:15:22,965
- Just tell me what happened.
- What I am telling you.

146
00:15:23,764 --> 00:15:24,975
They can't be in the light.

147
00:15:25,008 --> 00:15:26,959
They hide in the
dark so you can't see them.

148
00:15:27,271 --> 00:15:29,357
I mean I've been
doing research, and reading

149
00:15:29,818 --> 00:15:35,412
and... I don't think I'm alone.
Poe... I think he saw them too.

150
00:15:36,451 --> 00:15:41,217
His writing's dark, and hopeless.
And he went crazy too.

151
00:15:42,461 --> 00:15:44,338
I don't know
what you're talking about.

152
00:15:44,654 --> 00:15:48,764
Well of course you don't. I have
to work nights so I can sleep days!

153
00:15:48,967 --> 00:15:54,537
My own fucking mother has to look
at me like I should be locked up.

154
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:57,350
I even tried to find out if there's other
people like us.

155
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,352
I made friends,
to see if it wasn't just me.

156
00:15:59,377 --> 00:16:00,685
And you know what I found out?

157
00:16:01,717 --> 00:16:04,646
- What?
- Nobody can help me.

158
00:16:07,545 --> 00:16:09,975
- I'm going to help you.
- No! You can't.

159
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:14,441
I shouldn't have called you.

160
00:16:15,334 --> 00:16:20,771
No, you did the right thing.
Just try to explain it to me.

161
00:16:25,898 --> 00:16:26,943
I'm scared.

162
00:16:29,404 --> 00:16:30,926
I'm scared.

163
00:16:31,287 --> 00:16:34,288
- There's nothing to be scared of.
- You're wrong.

164
00:16:36,874 --> 00:16:37,875
Billy.

165
00:16:38,918 --> 00:16:41,350
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?

166
00:16:43,813 --> 00:16:44,814
No...

167
00:19:13,408 --> 00:19:14,409
Hello?

168
00:19:15,639 --> 00:19:16,842
Hello?

169
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,959
Hello?

170
00:19:26,044 --> 00:19:27,045
Paul?

171
00:19:31,511 --> 00:19:32,512
Paul?!

172
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,482
Paul?

173
00:20:07,714 --> 00:20:08,715
Paul?

174
00:21:34,338 --> 00:21:35,990
Julia?! Julia!

175
00:21:43,974 --> 00:21:44,975
Julia... Stop!

176
00:21:48,442 --> 00:21:49,610
JULIA!!!

177
00:21:50,153 --> 00:21:51,154
Julia! Stop!

178
00:21:51,362 --> 00:21:54,162
Hey, listen, I'm not going to hurt you!
I'm going to stay right here.

179
00:21:54,187 --> 00:22:00,705
Honey, listen. Hey...
hey... There's nothing to be afraid of.

180
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:09,045
- How did I get here?
- You must have been sleepwalking.

181
00:23:05,406 --> 00:23:08,756
It's nice to see
someone else born after 1950.

182
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:10,975
Hey.

183
00:23:11,762 --> 00:23:16,146
- So, how did you know Billy?
- We were friends since we were kids.

184
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:19,120
I'm Julia.

185
00:23:22,498 --> 00:23:26,251
Right... Yeah... Um...
Billy talked a lot about you.

186
00:23:27,482 --> 00:23:29,896
Um... I'm Sam,
this... This is my roommate...

187
00:23:29,921 --> 00:23:31,297
- Terry. Hi.
- Hi.

188
00:23:31,896 --> 00:23:33,983
Billy, Sam and I
were really close in college.

189
00:23:34,008 --> 00:23:35,010
Yeah.

190
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,201
You were with him, weren't you?

191
00:23:38,904 --> 00:23:40,826
- The night that he...
- Yeah.

192
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,560
I'm sorry.

193
00:23:45,312 --> 00:23:47,693
Did he say anything to you?

194
00:23:48,334 --> 00:23:52,111
Nothing I could understand.
It was all pretty incoherent.

195
00:23:52,951 --> 00:23:55,451
Sort of like
maybe he was on something again.

196
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:58,240
You know he was taking Prozac.

197
00:24:00,184 --> 00:24:01,756
I guess it didn't work.

198
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,136
Excuse me.

199
00:24:13,463 --> 00:24:14,756
What?

200
00:25:31,675 --> 00:25:32,676
Hey...

201
00:25:35,178 --> 00:25:38,162
I just wanted to apologize for
Sam's comment back there.

202
00:25:38,475 --> 00:25:41,373
The guy engages his mouth
before his brain sometimes.

203
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:45,740
It's okay. I'm just a little
over-sensitive right now.

204
00:25:46,781 --> 00:25:48,076
We all are.

205
00:25:49,904 --> 00:25:51,881
So, had you
seen much of Billy recently?

206
00:25:53,779 --> 00:25:57,531
Yeah, until he moved
back here about 3 months ago.

207
00:25:58,107 --> 00:26:00,534
Do you know what he
was trying to tell us with all this?

208
00:26:01,779 --> 00:26:04,662
Maybe he was planning
for a really long camping trip.

209
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:10,794
- Or that he was afraid of the dark.
- I know that feeling.

210
00:26:11,817 --> 00:26:14,709
You had night terrors as a kid, right?

211
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,843
Did Billy tell you that?

212
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,537
Yeah. For a while
that was all he could talk about.

213
00:26:21,834 --> 00:26:23,975
In fact, it is the reason
that him and Sam and I met.

214
00:26:25,443 --> 00:26:28,021
- We all had'em.
- What?

215
00:26:29,594 --> 00:26:30,757
It's crazy, huh?

216
00:26:31,546 --> 00:26:33,374
See, we all got
really close freshman year,

217
00:26:33,407 --> 00:26:37,053
but it was only later that Billy
told us he had sought us out.

218
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,740
- He was obsessed back then.
- And what about lately?

219
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,678
He'd come to me,
recently, a few times,

220
00:26:44,873 --> 00:26:47,038
babbling about how
we shared the same problem,

221
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,178
how we need to stay in the light.

222
00:26:49,569 --> 00:26:52,124
I guess I should've
taken him more seriously,

223
00:26:52,373 --> 00:26:55,178
but I was so used
to Billy acting crazy, you know?

224
00:26:55,530 --> 00:27:00,871
It never occurred to me that
the same thing could happen to us.

225
00:27:08,592 --> 00:27:12,398
<i>You are the string days collected
like tiny silk beads</i>

226
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:14,271
<i>and counted before sleeping.</i>

227
00:29:52,885 --> 00:29:53,920
Julia!

228
00:30:49,107 --> 00:30:52,990
Hey, baby... Welcome home...

229
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:58,904
- Are you drunk?
- I prefer intoxicated.

230
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:09,975
Come on,
I'm just having a couple of drinks.

231
00:31:11,976 --> 00:31:13,163
What's with all the hostility?

232
00:31:13,187 --> 00:31:14,685
- I had an accident.
- What?

233
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:18,692
- On the way home. I had an accident.
- Are you hurt?

234
00:31:19,026 --> 00:31:20,027
No.

235
00:31:20,653 --> 00:31:22,865
Okay. Tell me what happened.

236
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,865
I was driving out
in the middle of nowhere and...

237
00:31:26,242 --> 00:31:28,092
I thought something
ran out in front of me,

238
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:31,568
so I had to slam on the brakes and
I nearly went off the road.

239
00:31:32,122 --> 00:31:33,242
Did you hit the 'something'?

240
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:35,209
I don't know.

241
00:31:37,053 --> 00:31:38,713
I don't think so.

242
00:31:40,222 --> 00:31:41,373
I thought I saw what...

243
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,847
I'm just not...
exactly sure what happened.

244
00:31:48,181 --> 00:31:52,560
Okay, well, was it an animal?

245
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:57,725
- I don't think so.
- Okay, so what'd you hit, an alien?

246
00:32:01,045 --> 00:32:03,259
I should have known...
I should have known!

247
00:32:03,363 --> 00:32:05,236
- Oh, hey!
- No, I should have known.

248
00:32:05,268 --> 00:32:07,195
- What do you want me to say!
- that you would make fun of me.

249
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,744
I don't know...

250
00:32:09,823 --> 00:32:11,829
I just know
that something scared me.

251
00:32:12,122 --> 00:32:13,970
I've got my defense
the day after tomorrow.

252
00:32:14,124 --> 00:32:16,751
I just don't need to come home and
find you getting wasted

253
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:18,212
with your idiot roommates!!

254
00:32:20,084 --> 00:32:23,396
Look, let me
tell you what I've been up to.

255
00:32:23,982 --> 00:32:26,429
There was a thirteen car pile-up
on the 80 last night.

256
00:32:26,888 --> 00:32:31,365
So for the past 24 hours I've been
cutting dead people out of their cars.

257
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:35,122
There's a difference between what
you've been through

258
00:32:35,146 --> 00:32:36,354
and what I've been through.

259
00:32:36,647 --> 00:32:37,648
Yours is in there...

260
00:32:38,607 --> 00:32:39,608
Mine's out here.

261
00:32:40,693 --> 00:32:42,904
Don't get confused
about which is which.

262
00:32:49,994 --> 00:32:53,222
Billy must have been writing
in this diary since childhood,

263
00:32:53,247 --> 00:32:56,342
so we thought you might
want to take a look at it.

264
00:32:57,127 --> 00:33:00,014
Maybe you can make more
sense out of it than we could.

265
00:33:01,131 --> 00:33:02,904
It's pretty deranged stuff.

266
00:33:08,763 --> 00:33:09,764
Like this:

267
00:33:12,896 --> 00:33:15,631
"Saw them again,
beneath my window, in the alley."

268
00:33:16,334 --> 00:33:18,231
"Always in darkness and shadow."

269
00:33:18,941 --> 00:33:20,108
"Where do they come from?"

270
00:33:20,358 --> 00:33:23,646
"Could it be that darkness
is their way in and out?"

271
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,584
"Origins. Incubus,
bringers of nightmares."

272
00:33:28,662 --> 00:33:30,646
"Grendels lurking in the darkness,"

273
00:33:31,076 --> 00:33:33,607
"can only assume
that light is my savior..."

274
00:33:34,693 --> 00:33:36,029
"Maybe it's all in my head."

275
00:33:36,384 --> 00:33:38,490
"The insane nightmare of a schizo."

276
00:33:40,459 --> 00:33:42,717
You don't seem
surprised by any of this.

277
00:33:43,506 --> 00:33:46,631
It's a lot like the stuff he talked
about the night he died.

278
00:33:47,654 --> 00:33:50,435
It's not too surprising that
he would write about it too.

279
00:33:50,943 --> 00:33:53,271
No, I guess not. It's just that...

280
00:33:54,603 --> 00:33:56,967
We were wondering if...

281
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,801
What?

282
00:34:00,826 --> 00:34:03,225
If you've had any
recent 'night terrors'?

283
00:34:05,236 --> 00:34:08,076
Yeah, actually, I have.

284
00:34:10,424 --> 00:34:11,560
Us, too.

285
00:34:13,842 --> 00:34:17,201
Ever since Billy killed himself,
I've had this uneasy feeling.

286
00:34:17,482 --> 00:34:19,701
You know, like I'm being
watched or something.

287
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:23,545
I mean, I'm 24 years
old, and I walk in a dark room

288
00:34:24,006 --> 00:34:25,850
and it's like I'm 5 again...

289
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:29,459
C'mon, you guys.

290
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:32,998
We've all been through an
extremely traumatic experience.

291
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,267
It's only natural that
certain uncomfortable feelings

292
00:34:36,352 --> 00:34:37,353
would be stirred up...

293
00:34:38,533 --> 00:34:39,865
You don't remember.

294
00:34:40,924 --> 00:34:42,093
Remember what?

295
00:34:42,611 --> 00:34:46,756
- How powerful those feelings were.
- What do you mean?

296
00:34:49,681 --> 00:34:51,014
When I was five,

297
00:34:51,509 --> 00:34:55,845
I watched my sister drown in a lake
where we used to spend our summers.

298
00:34:57,029 --> 00:35:00,764
Right after, I started to suffer
from terrible night terrors.

299
00:35:02,014 --> 00:35:05,040
There was one particularly bad night.

300
00:35:05,697 --> 00:35:08,389
I woke up screaming my head off.

301
00:35:08,892 --> 00:35:11,720
My parents finally
managed to get me to sleep,

302
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:15,181
and a couple of hours later, my
mother came back to check on me

303
00:35:15,206 --> 00:35:17,798
and I was gone.

304
00:35:18,579 --> 00:35:19,940
They looked everywhere:

305
00:35:20,204 --> 00:35:23,165
In the attic. In the basement.
All over the house.

306
00:35:24,194 --> 00:35:25,533
My mother was hysterical,

307
00:35:25,595 --> 00:35:29,006
she thought I'd been kidnapped,
or I'd run off, or who knows what.

308
00:35:30,178 --> 00:35:32,248
Then my father
went into the backyard

309
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,107
and he heard a noise in
the doghouse, of all places.

310
00:35:36,748 --> 00:35:41,701
He stooped down, looked in,
and there I was, huddled in the back.

311
00:35:42,852 --> 00:35:45,318
Naturally, he reached in. And...

312
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:49,084
that's when I stabbed him in the eye
with a kitchen knife.

313
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:53,006
I was convinced
he wasn't my father.

314
00:35:53,681 --> 00:35:56,389
That he was some
kind of demon coming for me.

315
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:59,576
I was absolutely sure of it.

316
00:36:01,732 --> 00:36:04,170
I haven't had that
feeling since I was a kid,

317
00:36:04,985 --> 00:36:08,881
but I have it now...
and so does Sam, and...

318
00:36:10,914 --> 00:36:13,115
we thought you might, too.

319
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:55,011
Julia?

320
00:36:55,036 --> 00:36:58,865
- Yes, Dr. Booth.
- I hardly recognize you!

321
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:02,584
In fact, I don't recognize you at all,
but come on in.

322
00:37:02,923 --> 00:37:05,203
It's hard to think of you
as that frightened little girl

323
00:37:05,228 --> 00:37:06,840
who used to come in here.

324
00:37:10,135 --> 00:37:12,095
My god, it's been what...

325
00:37:12,634 --> 00:37:13,635
Twenty years.

326
00:37:13,678 --> 00:37:16,764
Twenty years.
It's a wonder I'm still around.

327
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:20,998
So, what have
you been doing with yourself?

328
00:37:22,606 --> 00:37:25,776
Well actually, I'm going
for my masters in psychology.

329
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:28,467
Psychology?! That's wonderful!

330
00:37:29,097 --> 00:37:32,381
Now, tell me, outside of studying,
how are you doing?

331
00:37:34,769 --> 00:37:38,834
I'm not doing that well, Dr. Booth.
That's why I came to see you.

332
00:37:41,237 --> 00:37:44,428
I haven't been sleeping that well.
I think I had a recurrence.

333
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:47,935
- A recurrence? Of what?
- Night terrors.

334
00:37:48,383 --> 00:37:49,693
What makes you say that?

335
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:57,236
A few nights ago, I woke up
in my bathroom. Totally disoriented.

336
00:37:58,393 --> 00:38:02,951
My boyfriend came to
help me and I attacked him.

337
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:07,820
Well, it certainly
sounds like a night terror.

338
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,951
It's not unheard of in adults.

339
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,257
But really quite abnormal.

340
00:38:12,282 --> 00:38:13,283
Yes, that's right.

341
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:17,295
Night terrors can be part
of normal childhood development.

342
00:38:17,471 --> 00:38:21,100
But I've found that the most violent
and persistent cases

343
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:24,600
occur in children who've suffered
profound emotional trauma.

344
00:38:25,962 --> 00:38:29,665
If I recall, you
came to see me shortly after

345
00:38:29,779 --> 00:38:32,842
your father took his
own life, isn't that right?

346
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,341
Yes.

347
00:38:34,638 --> 00:38:38,450
So, your recent night terror
could possibly have been triggered

348
00:38:38,475 --> 00:38:41,084
by an increase in stress or fatigue.

349
00:38:41,566 --> 00:38:42,678
Am I far off?

350
00:38:43,178 --> 00:38:45,149
No. No.

351
00:38:49,153 --> 00:38:53,529
Julia, why don't we schedule
a formal session.

352
00:38:53,617 --> 00:38:56,701
I don't usually treat adults,
but since we have a history,

353
00:38:57,056 --> 00:38:59,243
you could come in here, describe
the things you're going through,

354
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:03,290
and we'll try to figure out
if it really is a recurrence

355
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:07,389
of night terrors
or if it's... Something else.

356
00:40:33,657 --> 00:40:35,693
You scared the hell out of me.

357
00:40:36,607 --> 00:40:37,951
Sorry...

358
00:41:02,392 --> 00:41:05,126
What do you think went through
Billy's mind when he did it?

359
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,454
The bullet.

360
00:41:08,689 --> 00:41:12,275
I don't know, Terry, the same thing
that goes through everybody's mind

361
00:41:12,376 --> 00:41:14,051
before they kill themselves:

362
00:41:14,634 --> 00:41:15,712
That they hate their life;

363
00:41:16,611 --> 00:41:19,682
They're better off dead than alive.
Blam! Blam! Blam!

364
00:41:20,908 --> 00:41:23,686
I wonder what it's
like to get to that place.

365
00:41:23,985 --> 00:41:27,064
Terry, stop picking it
or it's never going to heal, okay?

366
00:41:27,345 --> 00:41:30,985
It's not healing anyway. I might
as well get some satisfaction.

367
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:41,871
- I think it's getting worse.
- Maybe it's cancer.

368
00:41:43,345 --> 00:41:47,303
There is something seriously demented
about you, do you know that?

369
00:41:48,514 --> 00:41:51,381
You know, maybe
I should've gone to law school.

370
00:41:52,037 --> 00:41:54,850
Like I said... Demented.

371
00:41:56,771 --> 00:41:59,639
Look, I'm going to go out,
try to detox for a little bit.

372
00:42:00,634 --> 00:42:02,236
Are you going
to be alright by yourself?

373
00:42:02,445 --> 00:42:03,446
Yeah.

374
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:05,396
Sure?

375
00:42:05,657 --> 00:42:06,717
Yeah.

376
00:42:08,315 --> 00:42:10,287
Okay. Bye.

377
00:43:24,152 --> 00:43:25,153
Got you!

378
00:43:38,189 --> 00:43:39,408
Damn rats.

379
00:44:43,308 --> 00:44:45,017
Understanding your Child's Dreams

380
00:46:03,126 --> 00:46:05,600
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, Julia. How goes it?</i>

381
00:46:06,962 --> 00:46:09,813
Lousy.
I'm still on chapter four in Crowley,

382
00:46:11,103 --> 00:46:13,970
and I can't remember half the other
sources in my bibliography.

383
00:46:14,345 --> 00:46:15,712
<i>Well, look at the bright side.</i>

384
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:18,798
If you flunk, it's only another 12
months of hell and another 20 grand.

385
00:46:19,064 --> 00:46:21,158
<i>- But it could be worse.
- How?</i>

386
00:46:21,706 --> 00:46:23,173
<i>I'm not sure exactly.</i>

387
00:46:25,298 --> 00:46:29,447
Hey, listen Kim, will you call me later?
Make sure I'm still awake.

388
00:46:29,986 --> 00:46:32,376
<i>- Okay, bye.
- Thanks. Bye.</i>

STATE MENTAL HEALTH ASSOCIATION

390
00:47:50,289 --> 00:47:55,253
experiencing emotional difficulty...

391
00:47:55,378 --> 00:47:58,131
paranoid delusion...
subject claims demon...

392
00:50:20,959 --> 00:50:23,503
Could somebody turn
the lights back on, please?

393
00:50:26,971 --> 00:50:28,347
Hello?

394
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,373
Open the door!

395
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,325
Please, somebody help me!!

396
00:52:12,857 --> 00:52:14,234
Damn it!

Moore's Theory of Discordance
postulates that subjects,

398
00:52:30,886 --> 00:52:34,306
when presented with evidence
hostile to their world view,

399
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:36,486
experience
dissociative discordance

400
00:52:37,082 --> 00:52:38,876
or fight or flight reflexivity.

401
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,309
And discordance here is defined...

402
00:52:43,146 --> 00:52:47,943
as... Delusions of reality stemming
from childhood trauma

403
00:52:48,074 --> 00:52:51,827
and... A heightened
state of anxiety...

404
00:52:52,397 --> 00:52:53,774
Yes. Sorry.

405
00:52:54,595 --> 00:52:57,932
By increasing the number of
familiar external stimuli

406
00:52:58,306 --> 00:52:59,390
individuals will...

407
00:53:01,047 --> 00:53:03,592
well, individuals will try...

408
00:53:06,021 --> 00:53:10,947
individuals experiencing
discordance will...

409
00:53:17,996 --> 00:53:22,709
- Would you please excuse me?
- Yeah. Certainly.

410
00:53:55,917 --> 00:53:58,836
<i>Hey, it's Julia.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

411
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:02,298
<i>Julia, come on,
pick up. I know you're there.</i>

412
00:54:03,181 --> 00:54:05,309
<i>I'm sorry about the other night.</i>

413
00:54:05,691 --> 00:54:07,568
<i>So consider this the official apology.</i>

414
00:54:08,343 --> 00:54:10,071
<i>Besides, I want to
hear how your defense went.</i>

415
00:54:10,095 --> 00:54:12,305
<i>I bet you knocked
'em dead, but I need specifics,</i>

416
00:54:13,227 --> 00:54:14,520
<i>so pick up the phone.</i>

417
00:54:17,561 --> 00:54:18,855
<i>Alright, I can take a hint.</i>

418
00:54:19,396 --> 00:54:22,066
<i>But I'm gonna harass you
until you call me back.</i>

419
00:54:34,077 --> 00:54:36,121
<i>Hey, it's Julia.
Leave a message after the beep.</i>

420
00:54:39,463 --> 00:54:40,547
Paul...

421
00:54:43,754 --> 00:54:44,755
Hello?

422
00:54:48,134 --> 00:54:50,511
<i>Julia. This is Sam.</i>

423
00:54:51,929 --> 00:54:54,557
Oh, hi.

424
00:54:56,017 --> 00:54:58,060
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

425
00:55:24,795 --> 00:55:27,549
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, it's Julia.</i>

426
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:29,885
<i>Yeah, come on in.</i>

427
00:55:30,009 --> 00:55:31,011
Okay.

428
00:56:02,482 --> 00:56:03,733
Hello?

429
00:56:06,714 --> 00:56:07,714
Sam?

430
00:56:21,288 --> 00:56:22,748
Depressing, isn't it?

431
00:56:28,486 --> 00:56:30,989
Look, I'm sorry that I called you.

432
00:56:31,573 --> 00:56:34,410
I just figured that you'd be the
only one that would understand.

433
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:38,330
- Understand what?
- I mean, you see it, right?

434
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:42,083
- I don't know what I see.
- But you can feel it.

435
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:45,504
You definitely feel that
something bad is happening, right?

436
00:56:47,255 --> 00:56:48,256
Yes.

437
00:56:49,091 --> 00:56:50,718
You see, you do understand.

438
00:56:54,554 --> 00:56:55,639
Terry's missing.

439
00:56:56,307 --> 00:56:57,427
What do you mean, 'missing'?

440
00:56:57,766 --> 00:56:59,393
She didn't come home last night.

441
00:57:00,311 --> 00:57:02,111
The rec center
called me this morning.

442
00:57:02,136 --> 00:57:04,845
And they said that they found her
bag with all of her stuff in it.

443
00:57:05,024 --> 00:57:06,734
Sam, slow down. Maybe...

444
00:57:06,902 --> 00:57:09,111
Maybe she just
forgot her stuff in her locker.

445
00:57:09,403 --> 00:57:11,283
And what, left the
building in her bathing suit?

446
00:57:12,323 --> 00:57:13,490
Did you call the police?

447
00:57:13,657 --> 00:57:14,658
Yes, I did.

448
00:57:15,826 --> 00:57:17,226
They're not going to find anything.

449
00:57:18,118 --> 00:57:20,998
I've been studying Billy's diary
ever since we found it.

450
00:57:21,208 --> 00:57:23,751
You know, I can't seem to do much
of anything else. It's like...

451
00:57:23,918 --> 00:57:24,845
Sam...

452
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:26,205
No, wait, wait. Just listen.

453
00:57:26,254 --> 00:57:28,837
Okay, now I can't make
sense of all of it, but...

454
00:57:30,181 --> 00:57:33,678
"I was taken to their world when I was
five and marked, but it faded."

455
00:57:34,261 --> 00:57:36,640
"They only mark kids
who have night terrors."

456
00:57:39,684 --> 00:57:40,852
Listen to this...

457
00:57:42,579 --> 00:57:44,272
"Last week the mark reappeared."

458
00:57:45,126 --> 00:57:46,691
"It means they're coming for me."

459
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:50,612
Just listen to his last entry, okay?

460
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:56,117
"I can't write much longer,"

461
00:57:56,994 --> 00:57:59,038
"the mark on my hand
keeps getting worse."

462
00:57:59,788 --> 00:58:01,082
"I can't stand it."

463
00:58:01,706 --> 00:58:03,466
"I pulled out
this thing they planted in me."

464
00:58:03,583 --> 00:58:06,837
Sam, Billy was unstable,
we know that.

465
00:58:06,978 --> 00:58:07,986
No...

466
00:58:08,047 --> 00:58:11,298
This is ridiculous...
he'd had problems since he was a kid.

467
00:58:11,776 --> 00:58:12,860
We all did.

468
00:58:14,387 --> 00:58:19,126
Now, don't you think it's possible...
that something that scared us as kids

469
00:58:20,283 --> 00:58:22,626
has come back... To collect us?

470
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:25,084
What are you saying?

471
00:58:25,398 --> 00:58:30,111
I never saw Billy's mark,
but I did see Terry's...

472
00:58:31,814 --> 00:58:33,739
and hers looked a lot like this...

473
00:58:49,512 --> 00:58:50,596
Hi.

474
00:58:51,223 --> 00:58:52,224
Hi.

475
00:58:53,572 --> 00:58:54,573
What's your name?

476
00:58:55,788 --> 00:58:57,038
Sarah.

477
00:58:57,795 --> 00:58:59,338
My name is Julia.

478
00:59:01,439 --> 00:59:02,523
Are you all by yourself?

479
00:59:04,728 --> 00:59:05,813
Where's your mom?

480
00:59:06,905 --> 00:59:07,990
Heaven.

481
00:59:09,922 --> 00:59:11,314
Do you work here?

482
00:59:11,652 --> 00:59:12,540
No.

483
00:59:13,024 --> 00:59:14,192
I don't either.

484
00:59:17,443 --> 00:59:18,528
I'm a patient.

485
00:59:26,548 --> 00:59:29,439
Sarah... Do you have bad dreams?

486
00:59:30,702 --> 00:59:32,246
Sometimes.

487
00:59:33,718 --> 00:59:35,260
What happens in your dreams?

488
00:59:37,297 --> 00:59:38,756
They come for me.

489
00:59:39,658 --> 00:59:40,742
Who comes?

490
00:59:41,188 --> 00:59:42,572
They.

491
00:59:44,188 --> 00:59:45,648
Why do they come for you?

492
00:59:46,964 --> 00:59:48,341
To eat me.

493
00:59:52,668 --> 00:59:54,962
Does anything keep them away?

494
00:59:56,511 --> 00:59:57,971
Lights.

495
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:03,284
You think I'm crazy?

496
01:00:03,846 --> 01:00:04,847
No.

497
01:00:05,941 --> 01:00:08,189
Why don't you tell me what
you think it all might mean.

498
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,962
Our night terrors may not have been
induced by emotional trauma at all.

499
01:00:13,556 --> 01:00:15,851
Maybe something really did
come for us when we were kids,

500
01:00:15,876 --> 01:00:17,650
and planted something in us.

501
01:00:18,298 --> 01:00:20,509
And whatever it was, it left a mark.

502
01:00:20,814 --> 01:00:24,251
- Just like that little girl's.
- And now they're coming back?

503
01:00:24,478 --> 01:00:28,158
Yes! And that's why the marks
reappear. So that they can find us

504
01:00:28,665 --> 01:00:32,569
and take us back to the place in
our night terrors... Out of the light.

505
01:00:33,692 --> 01:00:35,318
I know how it sounds.

506
01:00:36,618 --> 01:00:40,783
Julia, you say you failed your thesis
defense with Dr. Crowley?

507
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:43,697
Perhaps you'd like to tackle this case?

508
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:53,066
Subject is suffering
post-traumatic stress

509
01:00:54,008 --> 01:00:57,011
from witnessing the
suicide of a close friend.

510
01:01:01,392 --> 01:01:06,025
Influenced by the erratic behavior
of two strangers,

511
01:01:06,423 --> 01:01:09,572
she allows herself to entertain...

512
01:01:10,954 --> 01:01:14,595
the paranoid schizophrenic delusions
of her dead friend.

513
01:01:15,243 --> 01:01:16,990
And why does she do that?

514
01:01:18,361 --> 01:01:22,517
Because she feels
a sense of personal failure...

515
01:01:23,738 --> 01:01:26,199
and guilt that Billy...

516
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:31,228
that her friend died.

517
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:37,767
And you are going to be
an excellent psychologist.

518
01:01:41,029 --> 01:01:42,406
I'll see you on Thursday.

519
01:01:43,917 --> 01:01:45,294
Thank you, Dr. Booth.

520
01:01:53,545 --> 01:01:55,254
Oh, Julia...

521
01:01:56,658 --> 01:02:00,743
If these demons were coming back,
wouldn't you have the mark too?

522
01:02:02,487 --> 01:02:03,865
Remind me what I'm looking for?

523
01:02:04,868 --> 01:02:06,767
Like an infected mark-thing.

524
01:02:07,111 --> 01:02:09,204
Little, pinkish. Like the size of a dime.

525
01:02:10,598 --> 01:02:14,290
Well... Nothing yet.

526
01:02:15,618 --> 01:02:17,783
- But it's early.
- Paul, this is serious...

527
01:02:17,931 --> 01:02:20,525
Okay. I'm sorry. You're all done.

528
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:22,337
No marks.

529
01:02:23,477 --> 01:02:24,340
You sure?

530
01:02:24,545 --> 01:02:25,713
Double-checked, trust me.

531
01:02:26,822 --> 01:02:31,329
Not that I'm complaining, you know,
but why'd you need me to do that?

532
01:02:38,193 --> 01:02:40,970
I met these two friends
of Billy's at the funeral.

533
01:02:42,243 --> 01:02:43,345
And?

534
01:02:43,728 --> 01:02:45,831
Well, they both had marks like Billy's.

535
01:02:46,361 --> 01:02:48,239
And so I went to tell Dr. Booth, and...

536
01:02:50,579 --> 01:02:52,775
Oh, you're just
gonna think this is crazy.

537
01:02:53,017 --> 01:02:57,676
Julia. Didn't we just search
your entire body and find nothing?

538
01:03:01,163 --> 01:03:02,720
So, what have
you got to worry about?

539
01:03:04,796 --> 01:03:05,892
You're right.

540
01:03:08,758 --> 01:03:09,759
You're right.

541
01:04:05,789 --> 01:04:07,249
Jesus!

542
01:04:32,032 --> 01:04:34,243
Somebody!

543
01:04:43,665 --> 01:04:46,345
Hey! Over here! Help!

544
01:04:47,337 --> 01:04:48,963
Hey! Over here!

545
01:05:06,648 --> 01:05:07,650
Come on!

546
01:06:16,853 --> 01:06:19,508
Hey, Paulie! We're
going down to the...

547
01:06:19,533 --> 01:06:23,001
- Woah. Hello, nurse.
- Get out! Get out!

548
01:06:29,478 --> 01:06:33,048
- You mad?
- Not mad. I'm embarrassed.

549
01:06:34,102 --> 01:06:35,392
But I'll get over it.

550
01:06:36,024 --> 01:06:37,402
Troy may not, however.

551
01:06:42,739 --> 01:06:44,950
I'm sorry about
the last couple of days.

552
01:06:45,411 --> 01:06:48,749
Hey, you feel. Don't apologize for it.

553
01:06:50,790 --> 01:06:53,084
Good night.

554
01:06:54,317 --> 01:06:55,402
I'll see you tomorrow.

555
01:07:35,335 --> 01:07:37,009
<i>And all for less than a dollar.</i>

556
01:07:37,128 --> 01:07:38,338
<i>What do you think of that?</i>

557
01:07:40,533 --> 01:07:42,603
<i>You can't beat that kind of value.</i>

558
01:07:42,718 --> 01:07:44,762
<i>As the power shortage
reaches critical levels,</i>

559
01:07:44,970 --> 01:07:47,597
<i>residents are asked to save
energy and turn off the lights</i>

560
01:07:47,806 --> 01:07:50,900
<i>in an effort to avoid more rolling
blackouts this weekend.</i>

561
01:07:51,227 --> 01:07:54,063
<i>And in a related story, officials
say the rolling blackouts</i>

562
01:07:54,247 --> 01:07:57,167
<i>will have an effect
on emergency services provided</i>

563
01:07:57,441 --> 01:07:59,068
<i>in the largest metropolitan hospital.</i>

564
01:07:59,485 --> 01:08:02,238
<i>This comes as another blow to the
already beleaguered medical center</i>

565
01:08:02,446 --> 01:08:05,366
<i>as eleventh-hour talks broke
down today between doctors</i>

566
01:08:05,533 --> 01:08:07,077
<i>and hospital administration.</i>

567
01:08:07,618 --> 01:08:10,371
<i>Hospital spokesperson
Jason Hildin</i>

568
01:08:10,993 --> 01:08:13,624
<i>stated that the doctor's strike
is a foregone conclusion.</i>

569
01:08:15,642 --> 01:08:17,431
This is getting ridiculous.

570
01:08:26,095 --> 01:08:28,305
<i>On the lighter side
of civic news...</i>

571
01:10:30,129 --> 01:10:31,130
Paul!

572
01:10:32,092 --> 01:10:33,467
Paul!

573
01:10:34,737 --> 01:10:36,198
Paul!

574
01:10:37,456 --> 01:10:38,706
Let me in!

575
01:10:43,069 --> 01:10:44,070
I'm coming!

576
01:10:45,123 --> 01:10:46,283
My God, what happened to you?

577
01:10:48,199 --> 01:10:49,367
Julia, what happened?

578
01:10:49,851 --> 01:10:50,728
Look at me.

579
01:10:50,753 --> 01:10:51,754
Let me see you.

580
01:10:52,041 --> 01:10:54,001
Look at me. Look!

581
01:10:54,566 --> 01:10:55,567
Look!!

582
01:10:55,904 --> 01:10:56,905
I've got it!

583
01:10:57,127 --> 01:10:59,267
Just like Billy and Sam...

584
01:10:59,471 --> 01:11:00,845
I've got this thing on me...

585
01:11:00,994 --> 01:11:02,204
Jesus, how the
hell did you manage that?

586
01:11:02,229 --> 01:11:04,272
Ouch!! Be careful! It hurts...

587
01:11:04,491 --> 01:11:05,659
Don't move. Don't move.

588
01:11:06,034 --> 01:11:07,495
There was... There was this thing...

589
01:11:08,209 --> 01:11:10,504
like a... Like a big splinter,

590
01:11:11,097 --> 01:11:12,306
and I pulled it out of me...

591
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:13,687
I pulled it out of me...

592
01:11:13,741 --> 01:11:14,798
You pulled what out of you?

593
01:11:14,823 --> 01:11:18,595
It was in my head.
This thing was in my head!

594
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:20,340
Slow down. Slow down.
What was in your head?

595
01:11:20,552 --> 01:11:24,017
I don't know... Like a kind of a bone...
or something...

596
01:11:24,573 --> 01:11:26,861
I don't know...
they grabbed me in my apartment.

597
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:29,603
In my apartment, they tried to get me...

598
01:11:30,717 --> 01:11:32,665
I ran down the street and I...

599
01:11:32,984 --> 01:11:34,611
I was in this bathroom and...

600
01:11:34,761 --> 01:11:36,798
Because of the light.

601
01:11:37,041 --> 01:11:38,837
It has something to do with the light.

602
01:11:38,915 --> 01:11:40,806
I think that they can't be in the light.

603
01:11:41,253 --> 01:11:42,796
Billy wrote it all down...

604
01:11:42,908 --> 01:11:43,909
Drink this.

605
01:11:48,291 --> 01:11:49,292
And electricity!!

606
01:11:49,448 --> 01:11:52,118
Which is why the
whole blackout thing...

607
01:11:52,468 --> 01:11:54,525
- They could be everywhere...
- Sit.

608
01:11:54,568 --> 01:11:56,079
- No... Everywhere.
- Sit down.

609
01:11:56,104 --> 01:11:57,775
Okay, take a few deep breaths, okay.

610
01:11:57,923 --> 01:11:59,468
- You'll be asleep soon.
- Asleep?!!

611
01:11:59,731 --> 01:12:00,891
I'm not going to go to sleep!

612
01:12:00,981 --> 01:12:02,221
Honey, you need to go to sleep.

613
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:03,485
Okay?

614
01:12:04,345 --> 01:12:05,796
I can't go to sleep!

615
01:12:06,038 --> 01:12:07,040
What did you give me??!!

616
01:12:07,535 --> 01:12:08,867
Don't touch me! Get away from me!

617
01:12:08,935 --> 01:12:10,867
Listen to me! Nothing's
going to happen to you.

618
01:12:10,992 --> 01:12:12,619
I will not let anything happen to you.

619
01:12:16,206 --> 01:12:17,665
I won't let anything happen to you.

620
01:12:22,082 --> 01:12:23,958
Now, sit down. Sit down.

621
01:12:30,095 --> 01:12:31,655
I'm going to get you
some clean clothes,

622
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:33,999
and then I'm going to take
care of everything... Okay?

623
01:12:35,195 --> 01:12:36,362
Alright?

624
01:12:37,602 --> 01:12:39,062
Alright.

625
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:48,880
Everything you're feeling is
perfectly understandable

626
01:12:48,905 --> 01:12:50,700
considering the week you've had!

627
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:56,393
The best thing you can do is
just stay here and get some rest.

628
01:13:49,624 --> 01:13:51,094
No!

629
01:13:56,391 --> 01:13:57,851
No! Let me out!

630
01:14:02,868 --> 01:14:03,976
Somebody!

631
01:15:59,562 --> 01:16:02,906
Wait! No!

632
01:16:04,203 --> 01:16:06,117
No!

633
01:17:22,226 --> 01:17:24,104
Stop!

634
01:17:27,378 --> 01:17:28,754
Stop!

635
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,167
No!

636
01:18:34,175 --> 01:18:36,053
Help!

637
01:19:24,522 --> 01:19:25,523
Hey!

638
01:19:41,296 --> 01:19:44,140
This really isn't like her.
She's just confused.

639
01:19:44,453 --> 01:19:47,937
All we can do is to wait,
see what happens. Make sure that...

640
01:19:51,088 --> 01:19:52,046
Julia!

641
01:19:54,296 --> 01:19:55,634
It's okay. It's okay, Julia.

642
01:19:55,926 --> 01:19:57,552
It's okay. You're safe now.

643
01:19:58,190 --> 01:19:59,442
You're safe.

644
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:03,141
Did you think
something was attacking you?

645
01:20:03,643 --> 01:20:06,102
- They found you in the subway...
- With a concussion.

646
01:20:07,103 --> 01:20:09,382
You're pretty banged up.
Let's get you back into bed.

647
01:20:14,421 --> 01:20:16,163
I was trying to get to the red light...

648
01:20:16,321 --> 01:20:21,226
Okay, we'll work all that out.
But right now you need to rest.

649
01:20:31,963 --> 01:20:33,828
Everything's going to be fine.

650
01:21:57,765 --> 01:21:59,968
How could she
get out of a locked room?

651
01:22:00,429 --> 01:22:02,085
That door was bolted.

652
01:22:19,823 --> 01:22:21,283
Julia?

653
01:22:39,331 --> 01:22:40,343
What is it?

654
01:22:40,948 --> 01:22:42,054
Nothing.

655
01:22:43,818 --> 01:22:45,148
Nothing.

656
01:22:45,984 --> 01:22:46,985
Help!

657
01:22:47,868 --> 01:22:50,329
Help me! I'm here!

658
01:22:50,565 --> 01:22:51,650
Help me!

659
01:22:52,499 --> 01:22:54,149
I'd better go call security.

660
01:22:55,038 --> 01:22:59,937
Help me! Hey! I'm here!

661
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:02,656
Help!

662
01:23:03,313 --> 01:23:04,499
Are you coming?

663
01:23:06,765 --> 01:23:10,031
Wait! I'm here!

664
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:17,023
Nooo! I'm here!

665
01:23:20,309 --> 01:23:21,309
I'm here!

666
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:25,420
No!
