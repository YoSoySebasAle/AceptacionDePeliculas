2
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,731
You're the third
emperor of Rome

3
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:05,133
whom I've served.

4
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:07,334
First there was Caligula,

5
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:09,369
then Claudius,

6
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:11,338
and now you, Nero.

7
00:01:18,613 --> 00:01:21,649
You send General Lucius
Caesennius Paetus

8
00:01:21,783 --> 00:01:25,019
to defend Armenia against
the might of Parthia?

9
00:01:25,153 --> 00:01:27,922
I'm the one who invaded
Armenia in the first place.

10
00:01:41,102 --> 00:01:43,470
I don't goddamn believe it.

11
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:46,741
I don't fucking believe it!

12
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,714
What's goin' on?

13
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:01,189
I should be the one
to repel the Parthians,

14
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,356
not that cocksure Paetus.

15
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,694
And you order me
to safeguard what, Syria?

16
00:02:06,828 --> 00:02:07,962
From who?

17
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:16,236
Parthians are besieging
our legions in Armenia.

18
00:02:17,705 --> 00:02:20,540
And there's a heavy
winter coming.

19
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:23,177
You better hope, Emperor,
that the power of Rome

20
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,215
rests solely, not in the hands
of your appointed generals,

21
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:29,984
but in the hearts of those
anonymous soldiers

22
00:02:30,118 --> 00:02:32,754
who make up your legions.

23
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,638
Oh.

24
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,291
Proceed, Marcus.

25
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,459
What is the latest?

26
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,494
A new message
from the Parthians.

27
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,563
They demand we surrender.

28
00:04:23,698 --> 00:04:24,966
They give us three days.

29
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,667
They guarantee we will not
be killed if...

30
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:27,969
Burn it.

31
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:29,904
Surrender is not an option.

32
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:32,039
- General...
- I said no!

33
00:04:32,173 --> 00:04:33,573
Damn it.

34
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:48,189
The Parthians control
the pass.

35
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:51,125
The Scythians have cut off
our supply route here.

36
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:54,328
If we don't get help,
we'll die of starvation.

37
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:57,231
Do you also think
that this is all my fault,

38
00:04:57,365 --> 00:04:59,466
for making camp

39
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,603
in a place
that can easily be besieged?

40
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:05,373
That this is all the result
of my incompetence?

41
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,574
This is no time
to look back.

42
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:10,778
We're in no position
to sustain a prolonged siege.

43
00:05:10,912 --> 00:05:13,480
Our own men remain loyal,
but the mercenaries

44
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:16,150
- have deserted.
- God damn mercenaries.

45
00:05:16,284 --> 00:05:18,019
Any word from Corbulo?

46
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:21,255
I sent three of my best men
as emissaries.

47
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:23,590
They all chose
separate routes.

48
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:25,425
But the mountains are thick

49
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:27,361
with enemies familiar
with our plans.

50
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,297
They all failed.

51
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:32,266
There is one final option.

52
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,304
Take the only route the enemy
will not expect us to take.

53
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,438
A handful
of well-prepared men

54
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:40,507
could scale the ravine.

55
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,680
Once in the forest,
it's a seven-day

56
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:49,449
forest march to Syria
and Corbulo's scouts.

57
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,385
Are you telling me, Marcus,

58
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,220
that a few of our men,

59
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:55,222
exhausted and starving to death,

60
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:57,825
will be able
to scale a cliff,

61
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,194
walk and run
through the forest,

62
00:06:00,328 --> 00:06:01,662
battle the enemy,

63
00:06:01,796 --> 00:06:04,732
and reach Syria
in just a few days?

64
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:07,435
Precisely.

65
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:10,470
I can see that I'm not the
only one who has lost his head.

66
00:06:10,604 --> 00:06:11,872
It's the only route

67
00:06:12,006 --> 00:06:14,008
that will not be crawling
with the enemy.

68
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:16,476
Meanwhile,
we can make them believe

69
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,779
we're contemplating
the terms of the surrender.

70
00:06:18,913 --> 00:06:21,215
Corbulo, that bastard.

71
00:06:23,351 --> 00:06:26,887
I never imagined that
my greatest political foe

72
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:30,257
would one day be
my only hope for survival.

73
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:32,827
And what if,
after all this...

74
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:37,365
he refuses to come
to our aid?

75
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,100
It's a risk we have to take.

76
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:43,270
The route is impossible.

77
00:06:45,373 --> 00:06:47,274
Have you already considered

78
00:06:47,408 --> 00:06:50,911
whom to entrust
with this lunacy?

79
00:06:51,045 --> 00:06:53,214
He is a soldier,

80
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:55,515
raised in the mountains
of North Hispania.

81
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,952
Excellent climber and fighter.

82
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:02,456
Highly revered
by the auxiliary cohorts.

83
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,492
Auxiliary cohorts?

84
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:05,926
He might desert.

85
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,461
He is a soldier.

86
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,363
Loyal to Rome.

87
00:07:09,497 --> 00:07:11,598
There are others,
younger, stronger.

88
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:13,566
But none with his capacity
to endure.

89
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:16,137
What's his name?

90
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,738
They call him Noreno.

91
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:22,076
Do you think he will do it?

92
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:28,449
If it's an order,
he'll obey it to the end.

93
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,651
Yes, an order.

94
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:32,920
Duty.

95
00:07:33,054 --> 00:07:35,823
A soldier's lot is nothing
but to obey orders,

96
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:39,260
to fight and sacrifice
one's life

97
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:40,593
without thinking.

98
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:42,797
What is hard
is to make decisions.

99
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,498
They must leave tonight.

100
00:07:44,632 --> 00:07:47,134
We are all already dead, Marcus.

101
00:07:47,268 --> 00:07:49,036
Your plan is impossible.

102
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:53,607
I can already see Corbulo

103
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:55,509
as he hears the news
of my defeat,

104
00:07:55,643 --> 00:07:57,711
the outcome
of my strategic blunder.

105
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:59,847
His smile.

106
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,217
We are going to need
great assistance from the gods,

107
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:07,455
if we are basing our hopes

108
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,190
on a mountain man.

109
00:08:10,124 --> 00:08:12,660
But if the gods
are willing...

110
00:08:14,195 --> 00:08:15,329
so be it.

111
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:54,001
Sir,
Noreno the soldier is here.

112
00:09:01,442 --> 00:09:02,743
Noreno.

113
00:09:06,615 --> 00:09:07,748
You called for me, sir.

114
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:09,283
You've been selected

115
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,852
to deliver a message
to General Corbulo.

116
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,092
The others failed

117
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,227
because they chose
a wrong route.

118
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:22,863
You'll go by one
the enemy does not expect.

119
00:09:22,997 --> 00:09:24,365
Through the ravine.

120
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:27,668
Sir,

121
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:29,703
what you ask of me
is impossible.

122
00:09:29,837 --> 00:09:32,072
Impossible or not,
that's our only chance

123
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:33,374
to survive.

124
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:39,747
I am aware
of your qualities.

125
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,916
I didn't select you
for your obvious skills.

126
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:45,753
You were chosen because of
your rare capacity to endure.

127
00:09:45,886 --> 00:09:47,788
If anyone can succeed...

128
00:09:50,224 --> 00:09:51,458
it's you.

129
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:55,229
We have provisions
for only two more days.

130
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:57,998
If the enemy doesn't
kill us, then...

131
00:09:58,132 --> 00:10:01,001
the lack of food
or the cold will.

132
00:10:01,135 --> 00:10:03,437
The entire Roman legion

133
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:05,272
destroyed, disgraced.

134
00:10:05,406 --> 00:10:07,141
You must succeed.

135
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,443
- When do I leave?
- Now.

136
00:10:09,577 --> 00:10:11,579
When you leave the camp,

137
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:14,081
run straight for the ravine.

138
00:10:14,215 --> 00:10:17,151
Scale its walls.
Once in the forest, head southwest

139
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,987
till you hit Syria
and Corbulo's scouts.

140
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,991
Help me return to Rome.

141
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:29,897
Help me see my son.

142
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:32,466
I will do my best.

143
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:40,174
When you reach Corbulo,
give him this.

144
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:44,011
That parchment
bears Paetus' seal.

145
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:59,260
Oh, may the gods
protect you.

146
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:01,663
Go out from here and run

147
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:04,531
as if Hades himself
were pursuing you.

148
00:12:41,696 --> 00:12:43,197
For Rome!

149
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:01,081
I'm sorry, my friend!

150
00:13:08,857 --> 00:13:10,124
Go!

151
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,494
Run!

152
00:13:22,704 --> 00:13:23,904
Come on.

153
00:13:39,888 --> 00:13:41,188
No!

154
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:22,196
<i>Si?</i>

155
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:41,616
Another idiotic Roman

156
00:14:41,749 --> 00:14:44,585
who believes he can cross
these terraces to seek help.

157
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,357
What do I do with him, Saka?

158
00:15:00,869 --> 00:15:03,203
Damn proud Romans.

159
00:15:03,337 --> 00:15:04,973
When are they ever
going to stop?

160
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:07,842
Their pride
is what makes them great.

161
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,094
They can't go far.

162
00:15:29,864 --> 00:15:31,365
Look over there.

163
00:15:44,946 --> 00:15:46,179
Here.

164
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:47,782
Here's the famous ravine.

165
00:16:05,867 --> 00:16:07,067
Go!

166
00:21:22,917 --> 00:21:24,886
Two of the Romans
are dead.

167
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,955
The other scaled
the cliff face.

168
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:29,522
That route is impossible.

169
00:21:29,657 --> 00:21:30,791
Nothing is impossible

170
00:21:30,925 --> 00:21:32,592
if you have the will
to survive.

171
00:21:33,728 --> 00:21:35,462
They're just deserters.

172
00:21:38,132 --> 00:21:41,202
They sacrificed themselves
so that he could succeed.

173
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:43,337
He's making his way
to Corbulo.

174
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:47,141
The Persians pay us to kill
Romans, not to let them escape.

175
00:21:47,275 --> 00:21:50,177
Madyes, you and Saulio
make your way to the river.

176
00:21:50,311 --> 00:21:52,613
He'll have to cross it
eventually.

177
00:21:54,015 --> 00:21:56,516
I'll send word
to the Persians.

178
00:22:07,594 --> 00:22:09,030
Yeah, for now.

179
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:14,702
So Claudius, tell me,

180
00:22:14,835 --> 00:22:17,905
how far have you traveled
to arrive at the frontier?

181
00:22:18,039 --> 00:22:19,874
Hibernia.

182
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:21,309
Hibernia?

183
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:23,644
That's the edge
of the world.

184
00:22:23,778 --> 00:22:26,147
What's a Celt doing
at the Roman auxiliary?

185
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,049
I heard the pay was good.

186
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:29,216
Pay.

187
00:22:33,287 --> 00:22:34,889
Like most children...

188
00:22:35,022 --> 00:22:37,625
on the coast of Hibernia,
I was captured

189
00:22:37,758 --> 00:22:39,727
and taken to Britannia
as a slave.

190
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,762
I was a game keeper's
ward but...

191
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,166
they couldn't hold me.

192
00:22:49,003 --> 00:22:51,872
He says do you...
did you ever want to return home?

193
00:22:53,407 --> 00:22:55,776
I was away from home
too long.

194
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,779
I wanted to see the world.

195
00:22:58,913 --> 00:23:01,248
So, I made my way to Gaul

196
00:23:01,382 --> 00:23:04,785
and joined the auxiliary.

197
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:07,487
They've been the only family
I've ever known.

198
00:23:07,621 --> 00:23:09,256
And for that I'm thankful.

199
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:17,665
He says you should've gone
to Hispania.

200
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:19,367
It's his land.
Very beautiful there.

201
00:23:22,403 --> 00:23:25,106
Um, I was raised by
my grandfather in Hispania.

202
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:27,375
And, uh, when he joined
the auxiliary,

203
00:23:27,507 --> 00:23:29,143
he was stationed
in Britannia.

204
00:23:29,276 --> 00:23:32,545
So I followed him
and fought alongside him.

205
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,448
However, when he died,

206
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:37,451
I decided I would return
to Hispania.

207
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,620
I carried his body
to the top of the mountain

208
00:23:39,754 --> 00:23:41,789
and there I laid him down

209
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:44,625
so the vultures could carry
his soul to the afterlife.

210
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:46,593
However, when I returned
to the auxiliary,

211
00:23:46,727 --> 00:23:48,329
I met Marcus.

212
00:23:48,462 --> 00:23:51,165
He recognized
my ability and...

213
00:23:51,298 --> 00:23:53,768
well he gave me
a purpose.

214
00:23:58,305 --> 00:24:01,609
Oh, oh, I think he means,
uh, for Rome.

215
00:24:01,742 --> 00:24:03,543
- <i>Si? Si?</i>
- Uh, for Rome.

216
00:24:03,677 --> 00:24:04,879
- Yes.
- For Rome?

217
00:24:05,012 --> 00:24:05,846
- For Rome.
- Rome!

218
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,015
For Rome!

219
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:00,294
Let her go!

220
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:03,698
Get out.

221
00:32:58,478 --> 00:33:00,247
Do you live here alone?

222
00:33:02,316 --> 00:33:03,818
Where is your family?

223
00:33:17,531 --> 00:33:18,866
Noreno.

224
00:33:22,737 --> 00:33:24,304
Duria.

225
00:35:45,813 --> 00:35:47,547
I wouldn't do it!

226
00:35:51,451 --> 00:35:53,320
Look! Let me go.

227
00:35:54,689 --> 00:35:57,158
I don't have anything
to give you.

228
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,060
I know that you're
a deserter but...

229
00:35:59,193 --> 00:36:01,595
believe me when I say...

230
00:36:01,729 --> 00:36:03,731
I will not tell anyone
where you are.

231
00:36:04,431 --> 00:36:05,733
I will not betray you.

232
00:36:07,534 --> 00:36:08,703
Do you think
I'm actually afraid

233
00:36:08,836 --> 00:36:10,537
you'll tell someone
where I am?

234
00:36:12,305 --> 00:36:14,208
I'm not that important
that in...

235
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:16,409
they'll need
to send soldiers after me.

236
00:36:16,543 --> 00:36:18,880
I have no interest
in what made you desert.

237
00:36:20,214 --> 00:36:21,749
But let me go.

238
00:36:21,883 --> 00:36:23,684
You will have helped save
an isolated legion

239
00:36:23,818 --> 00:36:25,186
that has no chance
of survival.

240
00:36:25,318 --> 00:36:27,420
I don't care about you

241
00:36:27,554 --> 00:36:29,422
or your damn legion.

242
00:36:29,556 --> 00:36:32,627
Now let's see what
you've got in the bag.

243
00:36:37,564 --> 00:36:40,001
A message with a Roman
general's seal on it.

244
00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:43,436
I should be able to get
something nice for this.

245
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:45,206
You take what you like,

246
00:36:45,338 --> 00:36:47,440
but you leave me that.

247
00:36:47,574 --> 00:36:48,643
Try to remember
that you were

248
00:36:48,776 --> 00:36:50,178
a legionnaire, too.

249
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:53,014
Rome and all her glory

250
00:36:53,147 --> 00:36:54,514
can burn in hell,

251
00:36:54,649 --> 00:36:56,316
for all I care.

252
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:00,134
Thank you.

253
00:40:10,311 --> 00:40:11,245
Thank you.

254
00:44:11,885 --> 00:44:14,188
<i>A soldier's life
is lived outdoors,</i>

255
00:44:14,321 --> 00:44:16,857
<i>in every damn
imaginable weather.</i>

256
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,196
<i>I'm sure that's something
you can't imagine, Nero.</i>

257
00:44:27,001 --> 00:44:29,036
<i>But when you're
a Roman soldier...</i>

258
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,541
you get used
to your hardships...

259
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:39,480
<i>and what doesn't kill you</i>

260
00:44:39,614 --> 00:44:41,315
only makes you stronger.

261
00:45:36,437 --> 00:45:37,838
Look over there.

262
00:49:46,888 --> 00:49:47,689
Who the hell are you?

263
00:49:50,658 --> 00:49:51,726
Let me go.

264
00:50:32,566 --> 00:50:34,234
Please. I beg of you.

265
00:50:34,368 --> 00:50:36,203
I'm a Roman soldier.

266
00:50:36,336 --> 00:50:37,672
I'm on a mission of mercy.

267
00:50:37,805 --> 00:50:40,140
My men have no food
and no water.

268
00:50:40,273 --> 00:50:42,142
Nobody cares.

269
00:50:42,275 --> 00:50:43,745
Least of all me.

270
00:50:43,878 --> 00:50:45,145
I just wanna sell you.

271
00:50:45,278 --> 00:50:46,914
Scyles.

272
00:50:49,917 --> 00:50:52,754
How the hell did you get all
the way out here with just this?

273
00:50:53,353 --> 00:50:54,822
Scyles!

274
00:50:54,956 --> 00:50:56,223
Shit.

275
00:50:56,356 --> 00:50:58,626
That man belongs to me!

276
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,896
Yeah? Well these
bonds say otherwise!

277
00:51:03,131 --> 00:51:05,432
You're getting old
and slow, Medea.

278
00:51:06,968 --> 00:51:08,603
Turn around.

279
00:51:08,736 --> 00:51:10,772
Go back to your woman,
Solias.

280
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:14,274
Oh, wait...

281
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:17,511
You can't.

282
00:51:18,278 --> 00:51:19,546
I killed her.

283
00:51:22,249 --> 00:51:24,184
This world is mine.

284
00:51:24,317 --> 00:51:25,987
Anyone who comes
across this patch

285
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:27,822
belongs to me.

286
00:51:28,522 --> 00:51:31,258
She wandered too far!

287
00:51:31,391 --> 00:51:34,294
And now,
she paid the price.

288
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:38,166
This bounty is mine.

289
00:51:38,298 --> 00:51:40,835
And I am claiming my reward!

290
00:54:12,385 --> 00:54:14,088
Take my hand.

291
00:54:16,324 --> 00:54:17,892
Take it!

292
00:55:53,654 --> 00:55:55,990
Steady, soldier.

293
00:55:56,123 --> 00:55:57,358
Stay calm.

294
00:55:57,524 --> 00:55:59,459
You're safe.

295
00:56:00,493 --> 00:56:02,363
Rest.

296
00:56:02,495 --> 00:56:04,932
No, I cannot rest.

297
00:56:05,598 --> 00:56:07,534
Where am I?

298
00:56:08,369 --> 00:56:09,536
How long have I been here?

299
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:11,839
No one is following you.

300
00:56:13,341 --> 00:56:14,742
Stay still.

301
00:56:15,309 --> 00:56:17,845
You are safe here.

302
00:56:17,979 --> 00:56:18,913
Shh.

303
00:56:19,046 --> 00:56:20,181
You are safe.

304
00:56:21,581 --> 00:56:23,384
<i>"There was
nothing to animate</i>

305
00:56:23,516 --> 00:56:25,386
<i>the drooping spirits
of the army</i>

306
00:56:25,518 --> 00:56:27,221
but the example
of their general,

307
00:56:27,355 --> 00:56:28,488
who endured even more

308
00:56:28,622 --> 00:56:30,191
than the common
soldiers did."

309
00:56:31,659 --> 00:56:33,361
That was written about me,

310
00:56:33,493 --> 00:56:35,930
about my conquests
of Armenia,

311
00:56:36,063 --> 00:56:39,066
whose future Paetus
now holds in the...

312
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,003
in the palm
of his grubby little hand.

313
00:56:47,341 --> 00:56:49,877
When our long
arduous march

314
00:56:50,011 --> 00:56:51,412
took us through
hot, desolate

315
00:56:51,544 --> 00:56:53,280
and rugged countryside,

316
00:56:54,648 --> 00:56:58,419
with food
and water scarce,

317
00:56:58,551 --> 00:57:01,322
and the Armenians
likely to launch

318
00:57:01,455 --> 00:57:03,991
an obstinate defense...

319
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,261
do you know what I did?

320
00:57:11,265 --> 00:57:14,301
I executed Vadandus,

321
00:57:14,435 --> 00:57:16,003
one of the nobles
I had captured,

322
00:57:16,137 --> 00:57:18,739
and I cut off
his fucking head.

323
00:57:20,474 --> 00:57:23,277
And then I took his head

324
00:57:24,478 --> 00:57:26,714
and I put it in
the ballista,

325
00:57:26,847 --> 00:57:28,548
and I sent it catapulting

326
00:57:28,682 --> 00:57:31,152
into the enemy's
fortifications.

327
00:57:32,653 --> 00:57:34,455
And they took it as a...

328
00:57:34,587 --> 00:57:35,689
a portent.

329
00:57:35,823 --> 00:57:37,625
They hastened to surrender.

330
00:57:43,464 --> 00:57:45,166
That's a true story.

331
00:57:46,801 --> 00:57:49,003
Would you have had
the wiles to act as I have?

332
00:57:53,007 --> 00:57:54,141
No.

333
00:57:54,275 --> 00:57:57,945
<i>Only a true soldier
has such an imagination.</i>

334
00:58:00,281 --> 00:58:01,581
Ah.

335
00:58:02,149 --> 00:58:03,284
You are awake.

336
00:58:07,855 --> 00:58:09,356
How long was I out?

337
00:58:10,124 --> 00:58:11,158
Almost a day.

338
00:58:11,292 --> 00:58:12,993
A day?

339
00:58:13,127 --> 00:58:14,695
I really must...

340
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:18,365
Go. Yes.

341
00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:24,205
I heard a few mumblings.

342
00:58:24,338 --> 00:58:27,041
A name. Duria?

343
00:58:27,975 --> 00:58:30,444
Tell me,
from what do you run?

344
00:58:30,578 --> 00:58:31,579
Bandits?

345
00:58:31,712 --> 00:58:33,247
Other Romans, perhaps?

346
00:58:34,782 --> 00:58:36,817
Did you desert
your legion?

347
00:58:37,418 --> 00:58:38,586
I'm no deserter.

348
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:40,855
I, too,
was a soldier of Rome.

349
00:58:42,723 --> 00:58:44,258
But that was
a long time ago.

350
00:58:46,093 --> 00:58:47,561
I have a mission
to complete.

351
00:58:47,695 --> 00:58:50,164
We each have
a mission to complete.

352
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:53,400
Where are you headed,
soldier?

353
00:58:54,168 --> 00:58:55,970
To the Euphrates frontier.

354
00:58:57,071 --> 00:58:59,707
I carry a message
for General Corbulo.

355
00:59:01,275 --> 00:59:03,744
The lives of an entire
legion depend on my success.

356
00:59:03,878 --> 00:59:06,847
I see I am in the presence
of an uncommon man.

357
00:59:08,082 --> 00:59:09,583
Did you come across
the mountains

358
00:59:09,717 --> 00:59:11,152
from Paetus' encampment?

359
00:59:13,154 --> 00:59:14,255
Yes.

360
00:59:19,493 --> 00:59:21,262
And where did you serve Rome?

361
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:25,232
In another life.

362
00:59:25,366 --> 00:59:26,767
A distant life.

363
00:59:28,836 --> 00:59:31,606
I served under
General Vespasian in Judea.

364
00:59:31,739 --> 00:59:33,941
- Vespasian?
- Mm-hmm.

365
00:59:34,808 --> 00:59:36,010
But, he was the only leader

366
00:59:36,143 --> 00:59:38,345
capable of putting down
the Jewish revolt

367
00:59:38,479 --> 00:59:39,780
against Nero.

368
00:59:40,649 --> 00:59:42,683
And his practice
of rewarding

369
00:59:42,816 --> 00:59:44,685
and releasing his oldest

370
00:59:44,818 --> 00:59:48,522
and most loyal
of soldiers is...

371
00:59:48,657 --> 00:59:50,057
well it's known by all.

372
00:59:50,758 --> 00:59:51,892
He's legendary, sir.

373
00:59:54,228 --> 00:59:55,829
I would have very much
liked to have served under

374
00:59:55,963 --> 00:59:56,997
such a great general.

375
00:59:57,131 --> 01:00:00,401
Now, I serve a great king.

376
01:00:01,569 --> 01:00:03,337
I do not understand.

377
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:04,673
Come.

378
01:00:04,805 --> 01:00:06,440
Drink and eat.

379
01:00:07,308 --> 01:00:09,176
You need to regain
your strength.

380
01:00:36,837 --> 01:00:38,906
I know this country well.

381
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,042
Your destination
is not far.

382
01:00:42,176 --> 01:00:44,979
The most direct route
is across a span of desert

383
01:00:45,112 --> 01:00:47,548
that lies between here
and the Euphrates River.

384
01:00:47,682 --> 01:00:49,850
I recommend staying out
of the sun,

385
01:00:49,984 --> 01:00:51,752
if you can,

386
01:00:51,885 --> 01:00:54,455
and stick to
the dry river gullies.

387
01:00:54,588 --> 01:00:57,726
Perhaps not the most direct
route across the desert, but...

388
01:00:57,891 --> 01:00:59,460
they will protect you.

389
01:00:59,593 --> 01:01:01,195
Sir, without knowing it,

390
01:01:01,328 --> 01:01:03,597
you've not only
saved my life,

391
01:01:03,732 --> 01:01:05,866
but the lives
of an entire legion.

392
01:01:06,635 --> 01:01:07,702
I am forever in your debt.

393
01:01:07,835 --> 01:01:09,036
Do not thank me.

394
01:01:09,169 --> 01:01:10,804
I would do this
for any man,

395
01:01:10,938 --> 01:01:13,340
Roman, Persian, Scythian.

396
01:01:13,474 --> 01:01:15,776
I'm glad I'm the only one
to hear you say this.

397
01:01:17,144 --> 01:01:20,147
It could be your death sentence
for betrayal against Rome.

398
01:01:21,048 --> 01:01:23,150
In the name of Rome,

399
01:01:23,917 --> 01:01:25,419
I killed many men.

400
01:01:27,187 --> 01:01:29,624
Now in my wildest
nightmares I recall

401
01:01:29,758 --> 01:01:33,762
how sometimes
I even enjoyed it.

402
01:01:33,894 --> 01:01:35,562
But I was the one
who died.

403
01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:37,766
Enemies?

404
01:01:37,898 --> 01:01:39,233
No.

405
01:01:39,366 --> 01:01:40,801
Men.

406
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:43,470
In truth,
all of them equal.

407
01:01:43,605 --> 01:01:45,740
All of them
children of God.

408
01:01:45,873 --> 01:01:47,141
Equal?

409
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:51,445
And how, may I ask,

410
01:01:51,578 --> 01:01:54,915
did you return to life
after being dead?

411
01:01:55,049 --> 01:01:58,352
By listening to the words
of a crucified man.

412
01:01:58,485 --> 01:02:00,854
You should not speak
this way to anyone,

413
01:02:00,988 --> 01:02:02,823
least of all
a Roman soldier.

414
01:02:03,924 --> 01:02:05,526
Are you not aware
that Nero has sentenced

415
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:07,662
all Christians to death?

416
01:02:07,796 --> 01:02:09,830
I no longer fear anything.

417
01:02:09,963 --> 01:02:12,667
Not death.

418
01:02:12,801 --> 01:02:15,469
And, least of all, Nero.

419
01:02:15,603 --> 01:02:17,571
Without fear,

420
01:02:17,706 --> 01:02:19,173
we are free.

421
01:02:21,208 --> 01:02:23,944
Would you still be free
in a prison cell,

422
01:02:24,078 --> 01:02:26,046
condemned to the gallows,

423
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:28,449
or in the Coliseum
facing wild beasts?

424
01:02:28,582 --> 01:02:30,117
More free than ever.

425
01:02:31,318 --> 01:02:34,488
And you, do you not
want to be free?

426
01:02:34,622 --> 01:02:35,923
Well...

427
01:02:36,990 --> 01:02:39,193
Well, as strange
as it may sound, sir...

428
01:02:41,095 --> 01:02:43,063
these last few days,

429
01:02:43,197 --> 01:02:45,933
I think I felt freedom
for the first time.

430
01:02:48,035 --> 01:02:50,404
Although I was pursued
by my enemies and...

431
01:02:51,773 --> 01:02:54,375
quickly chased down,
and they were ready to kill me,

432
01:02:56,243 --> 01:02:58,345
I've never felt so alive.

433
01:02:58,479 --> 01:03:01,515
I've really reveled in these last few
days, away from the army.

434
01:03:01,649 --> 01:03:04,619
Then it may be that one day
you will know real freedom,

435
01:03:04,753 --> 01:03:07,588
like me,
without killing.

436
01:03:08,623 --> 01:03:10,057
And perhaps someday,

437
01:03:11,091 --> 01:03:13,894
you will explain to me
this truth of yours,

438
01:03:14,027 --> 01:03:16,397
that makes all men equal,
and free.

439
01:03:18,633 --> 01:03:20,167
But for now I must go.

440
01:03:22,136 --> 01:03:24,238
I am very grateful
for your help.

441
01:03:25,472 --> 01:03:26,641
Saul.

442
01:03:27,541 --> 01:03:28,976
My name is Saul.

443
01:03:30,511 --> 01:03:31,646
I am Noreno.

444
01:03:41,955 --> 01:03:44,091
I packed
some provisions for you.

445
01:03:50,564 --> 01:03:52,299
You said that in life,

446
01:03:52,433 --> 01:03:54,368
we all have a mission
to complete.

447
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:57,705
Have you completed yours?

448
01:04:00,474 --> 01:04:02,142
No.

449
01:04:04,879 --> 01:04:06,280
Wait.

450
01:04:07,548 --> 01:04:09,249
Here.

451
01:04:09,383 --> 01:04:10,652
Take this.

452
01:04:17,124 --> 01:04:19,026
God go with you, soldier.

453
01:04:21,796 --> 01:04:23,997
You are a good man, Saul.

454
01:04:24,131 --> 01:04:26,066
I will not forget you.

455
01:10:43,978 --> 01:10:45,545
I dream that your...

456
01:10:46,781 --> 01:10:49,416
your precious fool
of a general,

457
01:10:49,549 --> 01:10:52,787
Paetus, is close
to surrender.

458
01:10:55,455 --> 01:10:56,958
His men are starving.

459
01:10:59,727 --> 01:11:02,462
His mercenaries
are deserting.

460
01:11:02,596 --> 01:11:04,364
The enemies of Rome

461
01:11:04,497 --> 01:11:06,566
have surrounded him

462
01:11:06,701 --> 01:11:10,137
and have cut off
his supply of lines.

463
01:11:10,905 --> 01:11:12,240
Emperor,

464
01:11:12,372 --> 01:11:14,909
had I led the legion
to reclaim Armenia,

465
01:11:15,042 --> 01:11:16,277
for Rome,

466
01:11:16,409 --> 01:11:18,613
we would've been
victorious by now.

467
01:11:22,549 --> 01:11:25,485
Why hasn't he sent
for me for help?

468
01:11:27,221 --> 01:11:28,455
Too proud?

469
01:11:30,825 --> 01:11:32,159
Too vain?

470
01:11:33,261 --> 01:11:35,062
Too stupid?

471
01:11:41,802 --> 01:11:43,570
Yet I hear nothing.

472
01:11:45,072 --> 01:11:46,807
I hear nothing.

473
01:11:46,941 --> 01:11:48,142
Do you, Emperor?

474
01:11:51,345 --> 01:11:52,847
Nothing.

475
01:11:54,115 --> 01:11:55,683
No galloping hooves.

476
01:11:56,684 --> 01:11:59,486
No... there's no insistent
footsteps.

477
01:12:00,721 --> 01:12:03,523
No one... no one has come.

478
01:12:05,259 --> 01:12:07,028
No one, no one to help,

479
01:12:07,161 --> 01:12:09,496
not a single damn messenger.

480
01:12:12,465 --> 01:12:14,669
You ordered me here to...

481
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:19,140
not to marshal my forces
unless Paetus himself

482
01:12:20,107 --> 01:12:22,944
sends word that I must
come to his aid.

483
01:12:26,747 --> 01:12:29,884
Three legions are at risk
of annihilation

484
01:12:31,886 --> 01:12:33,921
because of your poor judgment.

485
01:12:37,925 --> 01:12:42,196
And you've condemned your
most able general to wait.

486
01:12:43,331 --> 01:12:45,666
Well, I'm waiting.

487
01:13:11,325 --> 01:13:12,727
Not good enough.

488
01:13:42,923 --> 01:13:44,325
Get up!

489
01:14:05,545 --> 01:14:06,981
That's the spirit.

490
01:14:09,350 --> 01:14:11,218
Show me, Roman!

491
01:14:35,543 --> 01:14:36,677
You've done well,
better than anyone

492
01:14:36,811 --> 01:14:38,212
could've imagined.
But there comes a time

493
01:14:38,345 --> 01:14:41,515
between hunter and prey when
they both know it must end.

494
01:14:48,989 --> 01:14:50,791
You're better than this.

495
01:14:51,659 --> 01:14:53,327
Sand?

496
01:14:57,665 --> 01:14:59,100
I'm not done with you!

497
01:14:59,233 --> 01:15:01,001
Have my fun. Get up!

498
01:15:01,135 --> 01:15:03,070
You're gonna tell me
who taught you how to run.

499
01:15:20,821 --> 01:15:22,756
That's it!

500
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:24,358
That's the fight
I'm looking for!

501
01:15:28,829 --> 01:15:31,732
We each have
a mission to complete.

502
01:15:51,018 --> 01:15:52,987
<i>Do you not want to be free?</i>

503
01:16:06,934 --> 01:16:08,135
Your mission is over.

504
01:16:08,269 --> 01:16:10,771
I will give you
the sweet release of death.

505
01:16:10,905 --> 01:16:13,340
Now tell me,
what is your name?

506
01:16:13,474 --> 01:16:16,243
I like to know the names of
things I'm going to kill.

507
01:16:32,661 --> 01:16:33,961
Do it!

508
01:16:34,728 --> 01:16:36,163
No.

509
01:16:36,297 --> 01:16:38,899
Your life
is meaningless to me.

510
01:16:40,301 --> 01:16:42,536
Now, you end
this macabre chase...

511
01:16:42,671 --> 01:16:45,039
or I swear,
it'll be your last!

512
01:17:38,792 --> 01:17:40,361
Permission to speak,
General.

513
01:17:47,401 --> 01:17:51,171
Well, what do we have today?
Is it urgent?

514
01:17:51,305 --> 01:17:54,341
Some of the patrolmen found a
legionnaire in the Euphrates.

515
01:17:54,475 --> 01:17:57,478
He claims to be
one of Paetus' men.

516
01:17:57,612 --> 01:17:59,146
Wow.

517
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:01,482
Paetus.

518
01:18:01,616 --> 01:18:03,618
Well, he must be a deserter.

519
01:18:03,752 --> 01:18:05,853
It doesn't seem
to be the case.

520
01:18:05,986 --> 01:18:07,388
He says he's a messenger.

521
01:18:10,357 --> 01:18:12,960
Paetus dares
to send me a messenger?

522
01:18:14,561 --> 01:18:16,230
Where the fuck is he?

523
01:18:16,363 --> 01:18:17,965
Outside, waiting.

524
01:18:18,098 --> 01:18:19,967
He was armed only
with this.

525
01:18:21,435 --> 01:18:24,405
He insists that he alone
will hand you the message.

526
01:18:32,046 --> 01:18:33,547
Make him come in.

527
01:18:56,036 --> 01:18:57,639
What's your name, soldier?

528
01:18:58,572 --> 01:19:02,843
Legionnaire Quintus
Laberius Surus.

529
01:19:02,976 --> 01:19:04,713
Second cohort,

530
01:19:04,845 --> 01:19:06,547
fourth Scythia Legion, sir.

531
01:19:08,315 --> 01:19:10,719
I carry a message, sir...

532
01:19:10,851 --> 01:19:13,454
from General Paetus
to General Corbulo.

533
01:19:13,587 --> 01:19:16,256
So you're bringing me
a message from Paetus?

534
01:19:16,390 --> 01:19:17,324
Yes, sir.

535
01:19:34,676 --> 01:19:35,876
Oh, I'm sorry,

536
01:19:36,009 --> 01:19:38,011
but you've come here
for nothing.

537
01:19:38,145 --> 01:19:40,881
Valerius, see to it
that this man eats well,

538
01:19:41,014 --> 01:19:43,183
and reward his efforts.

539
01:19:43,317 --> 01:19:44,719
No, no, don't,
please, sir.

540
01:19:44,853 --> 01:19:46,086
You must help us.

541
01:19:48,055 --> 01:19:50,090
I'll not allow that tone,
soldier.

542
01:19:51,358 --> 01:19:53,862
That useless
fucking Paetus...

543
01:19:56,029 --> 01:19:58,165
the situation
is all his fault.

544
01:20:00,567 --> 01:20:03,137
Settling on such
a mountainous area

545
01:20:03,270 --> 01:20:05,439
so goddamned
easy to attack.

546
01:20:05,572 --> 01:20:07,241
But sir,

547
01:20:07,374 --> 01:20:09,878
won't you do it
for the soldiers' sake?

548
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:11,512
They have no fault
in the poor decisions

549
01:20:11,646 --> 01:20:14,014
- of their general.
- Who do you think you are,

550
01:20:14,749 --> 01:20:16,250
talking to me like that?

551
01:20:19,987 --> 01:20:21,388
You speak insolently.

552
01:20:25,693 --> 01:20:26,694
Yes...

553
01:20:28,663 --> 01:20:29,997
you're right.

554
01:20:30,130 --> 01:20:33,267
The general's bad decisions
are not the men's fault.

555
01:20:34,034 --> 01:20:36,103
That's what war is like.

556
01:20:36,236 --> 01:20:39,173
I'm not gonna help Paetus.

557
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:41,709
Valerius.

558
01:20:42,543 --> 01:20:44,044
- Come on.
- No.

559
01:20:46,213 --> 01:20:48,282
I'm sorry, soldier.

560
01:20:54,021 --> 01:20:55,289
Why won't he help us?

561
01:20:55,422 --> 01:20:57,424
Thousands of my men
will die.

562
01:21:15,309 --> 01:21:17,478
Oh, what is it, Amariah?

563
01:21:17,612 --> 01:21:18,880
What have I done now?

564
01:21:19,012 --> 01:21:21,048
I gather you've heard
my reply

565
01:21:21,181 --> 01:21:23,083
to the messenger,
didn't you?

566
01:21:23,217 --> 01:21:25,085
I have told you
that business of Rome...

567
01:21:25,219 --> 01:21:26,688
Is not my concern.

568
01:21:28,790 --> 01:21:30,157
Yes, you have.

569
01:21:30,290 --> 01:21:32,025
Especially as I am
your mistress,

570
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:33,527
not your wife.

571
01:21:33,661 --> 01:21:36,196
Especially as
I'm not Roman-born.

572
01:21:37,431 --> 01:21:38,532
Amariah.

573
01:21:40,467 --> 01:21:43,170
Although
I was not born here,

574
01:21:43,303 --> 01:21:44,772
but this is my country.

575
01:21:44,906 --> 01:21:46,039
Your country,

576
01:21:46,173 --> 01:21:48,776
which is a claim
of the State of Rome.

577
01:21:50,077 --> 01:21:52,479
That should unite us,
not divide us.

578
01:21:55,182 --> 01:21:56,818
Well, all right,
it's true.

579
01:21:56,951 --> 01:21:58,987
I've refused
General Paetus'

580
01:21:59,119 --> 01:22:00,755
plea for help.

581
01:22:00,889 --> 01:22:02,657
And I've sent
his messenger back

582
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:04,191
on his way, empty-handed.

583
01:22:04,324 --> 01:22:07,194
My orders from Emperor Nero
are clear.

584
01:22:07,327 --> 01:22:10,330
I'm to remain here on
the banks of the Euphrates

585
01:22:10,464 --> 01:22:14,468
to safeground the...
Syria on behalf of Rome.

586
01:22:14,602 --> 01:22:16,838
I do
not understand you, Gnaeus.

587
01:22:16,971 --> 01:22:20,340
For weeks you prowled the halls
of this palace at night...

588
01:22:20,474 --> 01:22:23,110
sleepless, agitated...

589
01:22:23,243 --> 01:22:26,547
awaiting General Paetus
to swallow his pride

590
01:22:26,681 --> 01:22:28,382
and ask for your help.

591
01:22:29,082 --> 01:22:30,885
No.

592
01:22:31,019 --> 01:22:32,519
Beg for your help.

593
01:22:33,353 --> 01:22:35,255
Then, when he finally does so?

594
01:22:37,424 --> 01:22:41,228
There's no glory in arriving
too late, Amariah.

595
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:49,336
Oh.

596
01:22:56,778 --> 01:23:00,480
The young soldier boy,
he should be admired.

597
01:23:00,615 --> 01:23:03,183
I mean, look at the distance
that he traveled all alone,

598
01:23:03,317 --> 01:23:05,653
through no-man's-land,
wilderness,

599
01:23:05,787 --> 01:23:07,421
amuck with cutthroats

600
01:23:07,554 --> 01:23:10,090
and Parthian assassins...

601
01:23:10,223 --> 01:23:11,926
poor guy
went over mountains,

602
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:14,696
through forests,
across desert land.

603
01:23:16,463 --> 01:23:18,599
It's astonishing
that he managed

604
01:23:18,733 --> 01:23:20,001
to make it at all.

605
01:23:20,133 --> 01:23:22,003
- He was desperate.
- No.

606
01:23:22,135 --> 01:23:23,871
He's a soldier
in service to Rome.

607
01:23:24,005 --> 01:23:26,273
He fulfilled his duty.

608
01:23:26,406 --> 01:23:28,208
I have been
always impressed

609
01:23:28,342 --> 01:23:30,612
by the willpower
certain men exhibit

610
01:23:30,745 --> 01:23:33,213
when faced
with an impossible mission.

611
01:23:33,347 --> 01:23:36,450
Well, which is why history
will be remembered

612
01:23:36,583 --> 01:23:38,953
such as generals
as great men.

613
01:23:39,087 --> 01:23:40,287
Generals?

614
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:41,689
I'm talking about
simple soldiers

615
01:23:41,823 --> 01:23:43,992
like that messenger
who you dismissed

616
01:23:44,124 --> 01:23:45,660
without a second thought.

617
01:23:48,395 --> 01:23:49,831
He did his duty.

618
01:23:50,865 --> 01:23:52,232
You have told me many times

619
01:23:52,366 --> 01:23:55,103
of how you, above all
the other generals,

620
01:23:55,235 --> 01:23:56,638
particularly Paetus,

621
01:23:56,771 --> 01:23:59,339
appreciated the value
of good soldiers.

622
01:23:59,473 --> 01:24:02,342
And without them
and their stalwart strength,

623
01:24:02,476 --> 01:24:06,279
even the most...
best military commanders

624
01:24:06,413 --> 01:24:08,683
would have no chance
of victory.

625
01:24:12,219 --> 01:24:13,788
Are you saying

626
01:24:13,921 --> 01:24:15,857
I risk being forgotten
because I didn't come

627
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:19,927
to the aid of a general
who's no better than a cur?

628
01:24:20,061 --> 01:24:21,561
No, my darling.

629
01:24:21,696 --> 01:24:24,699
Your place in history
is more than guaranteed

630
01:24:24,832 --> 01:24:28,636
in your celebrated single-handed
military victories.

631
01:24:28,770 --> 01:24:31,005
General Paetus
cannot fall further

632
01:24:31,139 --> 01:24:33,141
in esteem
than he already has.

633
01:24:33,273 --> 01:24:36,077
He's humiliated himself
in front of his men

634
01:24:36,209 --> 01:24:37,477
and, most importantly,

635
01:24:37,612 --> 01:24:39,914
in the eyes
of the Roman emperor.

636
01:24:40,982 --> 01:24:43,483
But, if he dies

637
01:24:43,618 --> 01:24:45,385
all alone in mountains
of Armenia...

638
01:24:45,519 --> 01:24:47,521
Then, good riddance.

639
01:24:47,655 --> 01:24:51,358
If he dies holed up
in the barren cold,

640
01:24:51,491 --> 01:24:53,161
under vicious attack,

641
01:24:53,293 --> 01:24:54,528
besieged,

642
01:24:54,662 --> 01:24:56,329
possibly fighting
for his life

643
01:24:56,463 --> 01:24:57,799
with his last breath...

644
01:24:57,932 --> 01:24:59,599
No. That's unlikely.

645
01:24:59,734 --> 01:25:01,736
There's always
the possibility

646
01:25:01,869 --> 01:25:03,938
he will become a martyr,

647
01:25:04,072 --> 01:25:06,040
even a posthumous hero.

648
01:25:06,174 --> 01:25:08,042
Paetus?

649
01:25:08,176 --> 01:25:10,210
- A hero?
- Yes.

650
01:25:10,343 --> 01:25:12,245
A martyr's hero,

651
01:25:12,379 --> 01:25:14,581
who gave his life for Rome.

652
01:25:16,349 --> 01:25:17,885
Legends, my love,

653
01:25:18,019 --> 01:25:19,252
do not necessarily rise

654
01:25:19,386 --> 01:25:21,488
from the facts of an event

655
01:25:21,622 --> 01:25:25,358
but from the most romanticized
version of a story...

656
01:25:25,492 --> 01:25:27,695
the story that people
most wanted to hear...

657
01:25:28,696 --> 01:25:31,431
the hero they wanted
to believe in.

658
01:25:33,034 --> 01:25:35,203
Oh, well,

659
01:25:35,335 --> 01:25:36,971
what would you have me do?

660
01:25:57,390 --> 01:25:59,861
Deny Paetus
his immortality.

661
01:26:01,896 --> 01:26:03,197
March to his aid.

662
01:26:03,330 --> 01:26:05,733
Do not grant him
a martyr's death.

663
01:26:08,169 --> 01:26:11,172
If Paetus returns
to Rome,

664
01:26:11,304 --> 01:26:14,307
he'll continue
his campaign to slander me.

665
01:26:14,441 --> 01:26:16,611
And the fucker
has the emperor's ear.

666
01:26:17,812 --> 01:26:20,181
Slander the man
who rescued him?

667
01:26:20,313 --> 01:26:22,216
- Uh-huh.
- His savior?

668
01:26:22,349 --> 01:26:23,450
The general
who liberated him

669
01:26:23,583 --> 01:26:25,987
from the jaws
of a certain death?

670
01:26:26,687 --> 01:26:28,321
No.

671
01:26:28,455 --> 01:26:31,291
Not even Paetus
is that stupid.

672
01:26:32,059 --> 01:26:33,393
And of me?

673
01:26:34,862 --> 01:26:37,799
What will be whispered
about me behind my back?

674
01:26:39,066 --> 01:26:40,968
They will say...

675
01:26:41,102 --> 01:26:42,804
"There goes...

676
01:26:42,937 --> 01:26:45,773
The great and honorable
General Corbulo,

677
01:26:45,907 --> 01:26:47,474
who was so moved

678
01:26:47,608 --> 01:26:50,077
by the courage
of a single soldier

679
01:26:50,211 --> 01:26:51,578
a messenger
who weathered

680
01:26:51,712 --> 01:26:53,281
an impossible journey

681
01:26:53,413 --> 01:26:55,482
to plead for help."

682
01:26:56,416 --> 01:26:58,619
My advice to you, General,

683
01:26:58,753 --> 01:27:01,956
is to praise this faithful
servant of Rome.

684
01:27:02,089 --> 01:27:03,891
Say nothing of Paetus.

685
01:27:04,025 --> 01:27:05,059
Instead...

686
01:27:07,128 --> 01:27:10,698
speak in complimentary terms
of unsung heroes.

687
01:27:10,832 --> 01:27:11,699
Do this.

688
01:27:11,833 --> 01:27:13,935
The legions will love you.

689
01:27:14,068 --> 01:27:16,536
No one will speak
a bad word against you.

690
01:27:17,672 --> 01:27:19,874
You have condemned
your political rival

691
01:27:20,007 --> 01:27:23,144
in a life sentence
of public gratitude

692
01:27:23,277 --> 01:27:25,545
of singing your praises

693
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:27,682
through clenched teeth.

694
01:27:31,484 --> 01:27:32,854
Are you sure

695
01:27:32,987 --> 01:27:35,555
you're not secretly
Roman-born, Amariah?

696
01:27:37,258 --> 01:27:39,660
You speak with the wisdom

697
01:27:39,794 --> 01:27:41,494
of one with intimate knowledge

698
01:27:41,629 --> 01:27:45,365
of this political
machinations of the capital.

699
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:50,537
Politics are the same
everywhere

700
01:27:50,671 --> 01:27:53,373
as is the quest for power,

701
01:27:53,506 --> 01:27:56,143
internal and universal.

702
01:27:56,277 --> 01:27:59,847
The only thing
that ever changes

703
01:27:59,981 --> 01:28:03,483
is the names of those
who wield the scepter

704
01:28:03,618 --> 01:28:05,119
or the sword.

705
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,454
Go.

706
01:28:09,056 --> 01:28:09,991
Go.

707
01:28:14,561 --> 01:28:15,763
Valerius!

708
01:28:17,999 --> 01:28:19,800
Summon the tribunes!

709
01:28:19,934 --> 01:28:21,769
I want to see them immediately.

710
01:28:21,903 --> 01:28:25,139
The troops must be ready
to march at dawn.

711
01:28:42,422 --> 01:28:44,191
Congratulations, soldier.

712
01:28:45,458 --> 01:28:47,962
Do you know
what you're going to do now?

713
01:28:48,095 --> 01:28:51,265
Well, I'm going to return
to Armenia.

714
01:28:51,399 --> 01:28:53,533
You're gonna go back?

715
01:28:54,434 --> 01:28:56,503
But your mission
was a success.

716
01:28:57,004 --> 01:28:58,205
Yes.

717
01:28:58,339 --> 01:29:00,274
But when I was
on my way here,

718
01:29:00,408 --> 01:29:02,376
I met a man,

719
01:29:02,509 --> 01:29:05,512
and he said to me
that in life

720
01:29:05,646 --> 01:29:07,982
we all have a mission
that needs to be fulfilled.

721
01:29:09,183 --> 01:29:11,518
And I feel like I still
haven't fulfilled mine.

722
01:29:12,787 --> 01:29:16,190
And I'd like to think
that maybe...

723
01:29:16,324 --> 01:29:17,625
somewhere out there,

724
01:29:17,758 --> 01:29:19,694
there's a woman
waiting for me.

725
01:29:21,996 --> 01:29:23,998
And I can live a life
in peace.

726
01:29:25,166 --> 01:29:26,701
Well...

727
01:29:26,834 --> 01:29:29,737
may the gods help you
in your new life, soldier.

728
