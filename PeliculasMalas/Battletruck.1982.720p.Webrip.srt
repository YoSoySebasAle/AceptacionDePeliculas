1
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:28,663
Satellite
measurements of the Mesopotamian.

2
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:32,299
Basin show that radioactivity
levels remain high,

3
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,801
and with the oil spills in
Arabia still burning, the world's

4
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:38,038
total reserves of petroleum
have dropped even lower

5
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,507
making gasoline all
but unobtainable,

6
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:42,607
except for governmental agencies.

7
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,379
Food riots have continued
into the third day,

8
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,382
and marshal law was declared
for all of greater Detroit.

9
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:52,018
Army units and the National
Guard have been called in

10
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:55,321
to restore order and the
military commander from Michigan.

11
00:00:58,491 --> 00:01:00,491
That all looters will
be shot on sight.

12
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:05,098
The migration into the
countryside continues,

13
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,902
and once-peaceful rural areas
have become a battlefield

14
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:12,072
as roaming bands of what
can only be called bandits

15
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:15,275
raid farming communities for
well-hidden supplies of fuel,

16
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,144
as well as food and ammunition.

17
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,314
The most notorious of these
groups is lead by the renegade

18
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:25,051
army colonel Straker who
travels in a heavily-armored

19
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:28,588
vehicle and has so far eluded
all attempts for capture.

20
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,058
With most of the law enforcement
agencies fully committed

21
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:35,128
to the cities, it looks like
his mobile reign of terror

22
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,228
will continue for some time.

23
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,091
Hey, you hear that?

24
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:14,191
What's that noise?

25
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,064
It's just the wind.
- No, I can hear something.

26
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:20,164
Imagination.

27
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:23,630
Holy shit.

28
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:26,697
Come on, move!

29
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:27,734
God damn!

30
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,768
Come on, damnit!

31
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,543
Move, move!

32
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:38,544
My god, they're moving,
for god's sake hurry up!

33
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,549
Come on, move!

34
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:43,950
Move it!

35
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:49,455
Discard your
weapons and stop immediately.

36
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:17,050
Hey, Boss, they got diesel!

37
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,429
Morning.
- Morning.

38
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:31,231
Where'd you boys
get all that stuff?

39
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,000
We're just driving
along, we saw these drums

40
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,903
on the side of the road,
someone must've left them them.

41
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,510
I'll take you there no problem.

42
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,610
I know where it is, sir.

43
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:48,114
Take you there.

44
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:50,214
Thank you very much.

45
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,550
Yeah, yeah.

46
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:22,175
Hey, where's he takin' us,
this place is radioactive!

47
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,745
It's okay, the signs are
only there to keep people away.

48
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,845
Keep on goin'.

49
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,080
Open the gate, Bone.

50
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,719
I'm not going in
there, it's dangerous!

51
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,819
Open the gate.

52
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,537
Open the gate.

53
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,549
You'll be sorry when
your skin turns green

54
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,085
and your teeth fall out.
- Just drive the truck.

55
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,330
There's nothing here, sir.

56
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,965
Listen, I'm sick of burning
garbage in my truck.

57
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,902
It gums up my turbines, I
want that diesel, understand?

58
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,104
It's in the other
quarry round the back.

59
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,939
I'm telling you truth, honest!

60
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,039
That's good.

61
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:05,178
If you were lying, then I'd
have to give you to Willie.

62
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,513
He has a few games
he likes to play.

63
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,549
They work real good on dogs.

64
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,551
But dogs don't have
nothin' they can fears.

65
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,853
I'll show you, it's the
truth, I promise, I promise!

66
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,664
There's nothing here,
I'm gonna kill him!

67
00:09:24,764 --> 00:09:26,233
You heard the boss, he's mine!

68
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,601
If there's anything left
of him, you can have him.

69
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,701
Knock it off.

70
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,407
Where is it?
- Out there!

71
00:09:33,507 --> 00:09:35,675
It's underground, I'll show you.

72
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:37,076
It's not booby-trapped, is it?

73
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:38,612
No.

74
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,780
No way.
- Good, then you show me!

75
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,290
They got 50,000 liters, sir.

76
00:11:07,133 --> 00:11:11,203
I like this place, we could
stay here for a long time.

77
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:14,071
Set up camp.

78
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,411
Bone?
- Sir.

79
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,880
Distribute some home brew
to the men, they earned it.

80
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,382
Sir.

81
00:11:23,482 --> 00:11:25,482
Hey, set up camp!

82
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:30,087
Yes, Willie?
- Him, Boss?

83
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:33,891
Bring the girl.

84
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,335
How long you boys
known about this place?

85
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,337
My old man was a quartermaster.

86
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:47,306
When the government collapsed,
we sort of inherited it.

87
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,443
You were very lucky, weren't you?

88
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,844
Yeah.
- For a while.

89
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:53,379
What do you mean?
- Tie him up.

90
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:54,780
What?

91
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,880
Hey, wait a minute!
- Gag him.

92
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:10,828
Hey, Boss.

93
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,732
Corlie.

94
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:18,204
You're getting old enough to
take a little responsibility.

95
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:22,041
Now, this man is a liability
to us for various reasons.

96
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,141
Do you understand?

97
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,512
Good.

98
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:33,753
So I want you to do something.

99
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,853
Kill him for me.

100
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:19,298
It's a new world, Corlie.

101
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:21,398
With new rules.

102
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:24,334
Learn them.

103
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:33,746
Bloody drunk,
you're weak, come on!

104
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,481
Get your hands off me.

105
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,821
This place would
make a great base camp.

106
00:13:41,921 --> 00:13:43,023
Yes, but we're in a valley,

107
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:45,257
so I want complete
perimeter protection.

108
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,493
Set up a field of
fire along this ridge.

109
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,595
Automatic weapons
here, here, here.

110
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,331
Sentries outside the
gate, inside the gate.

111
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,968
500 yards up the road,
you have lookouts.

112
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,504
Patrols leave
through this galley,

113
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:03,642
through the high country,
returning here every four hours.

114
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:08,147
And most important, I want two
men guarding that fuel module

115
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:09,081
around the clock.

116
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,119
Yeah, well it all
belongs to us now.

117
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:15,020
Of course, Bone,
it was inevitable.

118
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,457
The generals were just too
chickenshit to make a decision.

119
00:14:18,557 --> 00:14:22,228
Wars are not won by men of
political ambition, my friend.

120
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:25,030
There's too much lipstick
and not enough napalm.

121
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:34,773
What was that?
- Your imagination.

122
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,630
Corlie!

123
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,568
Corlie!

124
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:18,408
Jackpot!

125
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,278
Hey, Corlie!

126
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,091
Corlie!

127
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,191
Corlie!

128
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:12,062
Have a cocktail.

129
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,731
I hate you, Willie!

130
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,012
Why are you running away, Corlie?

131
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:28,280
Don't you like us anymore?

132
00:17:32,584 --> 00:17:35,287
Poor little didum,
you hurt yourself.

133
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:40,192
Leave me alone, Willie!

134
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:41,660
We've gotta get him, come on!

135
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,760
Come on, you guys!

136
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:49,768
Ho, what a prize he'll be!

137
00:17:51,603 --> 00:17:53,603
Yee-ha!

138
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,141
Hey!

139
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,377
Wait!

140
00:17:57,477 --> 00:18:00,145
Be back for you, Corlie!

141
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:05,951
Quick, shoot the bastard!

142
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,051
Save the bike!

143
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,046
Get off.

144
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,527
Who were those guys?

145
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,233
I don't know, I
was lookin' for food

146
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,300
and they came up over the ridge.

147
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,236
You got people around here?

148
00:18:57,336 --> 00:18:58,570
Family?

149
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,206
Friends?

150
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,941
Anybody?
- No, my daddy died.

151
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:07,279
And then my horse ran
off with all my stuff.

152
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:11,414
Have you got any food?

153
00:19:12,551 --> 00:19:14,551
Get on.

154
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,557
Suit yourself.

155
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,973
Give me that hose, will ya?

156
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,608
What is it?

157
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,708
Methane, make it
out of chicken shit.

158
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:50,048
Don't you ever
get lonely up here?

159
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:52,184
Don't care much for people.

160
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:53,852
Did you fight in the wars?

161
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,321
Yep.

162
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:58,156
Bet you nobody ever
bothers you up here.

163
00:20:58,256 --> 00:21:00,256
Nope.

164
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,461
I better have a look at that leg.

165
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,296
No, I'll be alright.

166
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:06,396
Maybe.

167
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:18,208
Sit on the bed.

168
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:30,553
Gotta watch every
scratch out here.

169
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,226
You never know what
it might turn into.

170
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:37,663
Most things get better,
if you give 'em the time.

171
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,763
Not gangrene.

172
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:54,678
That bad?

173
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:57,547
I'll be more careful.

174
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,361
What was your father like?

175
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:10,295
He was a saint.

176
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,496
Everybody loved him.

177
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:18,637
We'd travel around and
help people, fix things.

178
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:22,072
This is gonna hurt some.

179
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:35,721
And then one morning
he just didn't wake up.

180
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,689
So I kept on goin'.

181
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:44,496
That's what he would've
wanted, I guess.

182
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:56,106
We gotta go.
- Why?

183
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,311
'Cause that needs sewin' up.

184
00:22:58,411 --> 00:23:00,712
Take you down to Clearwater
Farm, they got a healer there.

185
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,048
Medicine.

186
00:23:02,148 --> 00:23:04,282
But I feel much better.
- Come on.

187
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:11,823
Wait, let me stay here a while.

188
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:13,923
I can take care of the chickens.

189
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:17,026
I'm a hard worker.

190
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:20,600
Not lately.

191
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,135
Yeah, but I can if
you give me the chance.

192
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:26,035
You need people, I don't.

193
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:33,812
Okay.

194
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:15,855
Okay, this is it.

195
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:18,023
Just knock on the gate
and ask for Rusty.

196
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,226
You're not coming in with me?

197
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:22,360
It's not my kind of place.

198
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:25,330
No.

199
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,430
Goodbye.

200
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,699
Thank you for saving my life.

201
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,816
Hunter!

202
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,021
Damn.

203
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:51,757
I wanted to show him
that new shortwave

204
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:53,857
I've been workin' on.

205
00:24:54,292 --> 00:24:58,096
Picked up a signal from
Radio Mecca, prayers mostly.

206
00:24:58,196 --> 00:24:58,998
Damn!

207
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:01,133
My name's Rusty.

208
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:04,536
I'm Corlie, Hunter
told me to ask for you.

209
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,505
You're lookin' to join, are ya?

210
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,605
Yes.
- Good.

211
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,810
Good, well, come on in,
I'll show you around.

212
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,752
Hunter's brought us
some of our best people.

213
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:23,753
He sure gets around a lot.

214
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,392
Yeah, we're always shorthanded
here, even in the winter.

215
00:25:27,492 --> 00:25:30,629
But there's plenty to
eat if you like turnips.

216
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:34,232
Yeah.
- It's a strict democracy.

217
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,568
A little old-fashioned,
but it seems to work.

218
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,539
That's my workshop
right over there.

219
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:43,074
Over there, that's the main
dome wall, that's where you'll

220
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:46,278
be sleepin' till we can fix
you up a place of your own.

221
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,880
Well, that is if they
vote to let you in.

222
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,449
But that shouldn't be too much
of a problem, because women

223
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:55,387
are, we have a lot of
bachelors, are you single?

224
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:57,487
Yeah, very.

225
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,426
Good, good, well don't, just
be really nice to everybody,

226
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:04,763
but not too nice to any one
person until after the vote,

227
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:06,566
if you get my drift.
- Okay.

228
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:09,234
Rusty, where are you taking her?

229
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:11,403
This is Corlie,
I'm just showing her...

230
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,805
You could be carrying
her with a wound like that.

231
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,341
Wound?
- Come on, honey.

232
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:19,244
Don't you worry, I'll have
you fixed up right as rain.

233
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:24,482
There was no doubt that it
was a perfect fit, and then,

234
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:27,519
before the two ugly sisters
could show their surprise,

235
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:30,455
Cinderella's fairy godmother
appeared before them,

236
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:33,058
and with a wave
of her magic wand,

237
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,794
she changed Cinderella's
ragged dress

238
00:26:35,894 --> 00:26:40,065
into a gown of golden silk
which made the ugly sisters

239
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:42,367
gasp in jealous anger.

240
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:45,070
"Go now," the fairy
said to Cinderella.

241
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,173
"The coach outside will
carry you to your prince."

242
00:26:49,841 --> 00:26:54,112
So, Cinderella found true
happiness at last with her prince,

243
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:56,748
and the very next day
they were married,

244
00:26:56,848 --> 00:26:59,351
and lived happily
ever afterwards.

245
00:27:01,086 --> 00:27:03,086
The end.
- Thank you.

246
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,555
You're welcome.

247
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:15,600
That's lovely,
where did you get it?

248
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,700
It was a present.

249
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:20,069
Here.

250
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:23,241
No, I couldn't.
- I want you to have it.

251
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:25,341
Okay?

252
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,680
Okay, everybody, can
we start this meeting?

253
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:31,316
As you all know, Hunter
has brought us someone new,

254
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:34,653
and I think you've all had
a chance to meet Corlie.

255
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:37,822
Are there any questions?
- I've got a question.

256
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,291
About Hunter.

257
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,391
You said you went to his place.

258
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:44,629
Where is it?
- I don't know the area.

259
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,499
I was only there
for a few minutes.

260
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:49,267
I think we should
respect Hunter's privacy.

261
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,169
I've been there,
Corlie's been there.

262
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,269
I just don't see the point.

263
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:57,108
If it came down to him or
us, whose side would you be on?

264
00:27:57,208 --> 00:28:00,011
That's out of order, Judd,
it will never come to that.

265
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:04,682
Now, all those in favor
of taking Corlie in.

266
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:16,227
Fine.

267
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:17,663
It's unanimous.

268
00:28:17,763 --> 00:28:20,598
Welcome to Clearwater, Corlie.
- Thank you.

269
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,698
I promise, I'll work very hard.

270
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:24,770
Nice to meet you.

271
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,172
Good to have
you with us, well done.

272
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:30,775
Thank you very much, thank you.

273
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:36,648
Hi, Corlie.
- Hello.

274
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:37,782
How're you feeling?

275
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,750
Very well.

276
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:43,989
Say, would you like
to take a walk tonight?

277
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:46,089
Maybe.

278
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,660
It's just that
there's a full moon.

279
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,329
We could take a
walk up the canyon,

280
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:52,697
and watch it rise
through the Devil Peaks.

281
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:55,200
Well, if I'm not too tired.

282
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,770
Maybe.

283
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,338
Okay, great, I'll see you later.

284
00:29:03,641 --> 00:29:05,044
You shouldn't discourage him.

285
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:08,146
It doesn't look like the
discourages too easily.

286
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,246
How are your hands now?

287
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,518
They're still a little sore.

288
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:14,919
Where you came from,
didn't you do any work?

289
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,056
Not this kind of work.

290
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:20,156
So how did you live?

291
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,593
Differently.

292
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,566
Charlene, I...

293
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:37,108
Corlie?

294
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,208
Corlie, what's wrong?

295
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,946
There you go.

296
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:50,755
Everyone back to the village!

297
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:51,923
It's just a stranger,
it's probably nothing.

298
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:53,391
But it doesn't
hurt to be careful.

299
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:54,626
Do you know what this is?
- Leave her alone, Judd.

300
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,726
I said, do you know who this is?

301
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:59,230
Look at her, she
recognized it right off!

302
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,932
Judd, forget it!

303
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:03,032
Come on, Corlie.

304
00:30:31,462 --> 00:30:33,462
Come on!

305
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:49,078
Everyone back!

306
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,890
Run, Corlie!

307
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:05,597
Come on, we're nearly there.

308
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:06,531
Alvin!

309
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:08,501
Let me go!

310
00:31:08,601 --> 00:31:10,635
You don't understand
what's coming.

311
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:13,871
Let go of me!
- You'll be safe in here.

312
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:40,129
It's not gonna stop!

313
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,805
Stop firing.

314
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:23,408
Or I will completely
destroy this village.

315
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,790
Corlie, stop,
they'll just shoot you!

316
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:40,792
Come out.

317
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:43,926
Come outside where I can see you.

318
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,799
Everyone throw down your weapons,

319
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:49,899
and put your hands on your head.

320
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,803
Move.

321
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:56,939
Move.

322
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:36,047
Good morning, my name
is Colonel Straker,

323
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:40,017
and I have come to free you
from this anarchy and chaos.

324
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:46,959
Under my leadership,

325
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:50,561
you will relearn the arts of
discipline and excellence.

326
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:52,997
Nothing less will be acceptable.

327
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:56,467
So, you can plant your taters and

328
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:58,567
you can grow your sweetcorn,

329
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,203
but you will do this
at the direction of,

330
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:04,273
and for the purposes
of your leader.

331
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:08,744
This ain't no democracy, kiddies.

332
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,349
Who's in charge here?

333
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,449
Hey, wait a minute,
you can't come in...

334
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:18,854
Who's in charge here?

335
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:21,223
We all were.

336
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:25,628
Kind of a democracy.

337
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:27,765
Bone.

338
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,200
Sir.

339
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,668
Detail the men to
inventory and requisition.

340
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:32,203
Yes, sir.

341
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:33,304
Hey, Willie.

342
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:35,973
Inventory and requisition.

343
00:34:36,073 --> 00:34:38,073
Loot, loot!

344
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:05,036
I'm taking your weapons,
ammunition, medicine.

345
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:07,271
Any furs, precious metals.

346
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,508
A sewing machine if you
have one and half your food.

347
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,478
We're gonna
need that for the winter!

348
00:35:12,578 --> 00:35:15,113
Don't mumble when
the man's talking.

349
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:17,213
I will not abide disrespect.

350
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:22,253
By the way.

351
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:24,155
Where do you keep the women?

352
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:26,255
In the dome behind you.

353
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:42,773
Charlene, it's me, Judd!

354
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:46,077
You better open up, we
haven't got much choice!

355
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,815
Get in!

356
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:04,593
Please let the children go.

357
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,936
Stand up!

358
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,718
You.
- Sir?

359
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:29,387
Take the children to
a different building.

360
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,487
Yes, sir.

361
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:37,295
Wait.

362
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:39,395
Just a minute.

363
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:45,236
Where did you get this?
- Corlie.

364
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:47,336
I'll keep it safe for now.

365
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:57,913
Willie!
- Coming, Boss!

366
00:37:01,752 --> 00:37:04,188
Yessum, Boss?
- Take the women now.

367
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:06,288
All of 'em?

368
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,395
Well now, ladies.

369
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:12,897
Shall we join the, gentlemen?

370
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:17,602
The gentlemen!

371
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:32,316
Have you been
harboring a girl named...

372
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:35,353
Corlie, yeah, we tried to
kick her out, but

373
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,994
everybody here's afraid of
the guy that brought her here.

374
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,757
Where is she?

375
00:37:42,026 --> 00:37:44,061
Well, if she isn't here,
she must've run back to him.

376
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:46,161
That guy, Hunter.

377
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:48,066
How do I find this Hunter?

378
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:50,167
He's up in the
mountains somewhere.

379
00:37:50,267 --> 00:37:54,105
No, Bone, easy.

380
00:37:54,205 --> 00:37:56,205
Thanks.

381
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:58,109
I'll tell you who knows.

382
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,209
Rusty.

383
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:03,347
He and Hunter are as thick
as, they're good buddies.

384
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,650
I must have a talk
with this Rusty.

385
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:10,419
Bone?

386
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:41,116
Are you alright?

387
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,154
What happened?

388
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:58,971
Are you hurt?

389
00:38:59,071 --> 00:39:01,072
No, yeah, I mean...

390
00:39:02,139 --> 00:39:03,908
They'll kill them, they will!

391
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,410
Who?

392
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,212
The people you saved me
from, they're at Clearwater!

393
00:39:08,312 --> 00:39:09,881
Hey, get control of yourself.

394
00:39:09,981 --> 00:39:12,583
No, you don't understand!
- I think I'm beginning to.

395
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,683
No, I'm one of them!

396
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,522
Did you warn the
people at Clearwater?

397
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:19,590
What good would that've done?

398
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,626
Nobody can stand up against 'em.

399
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:24,195
There's always a
way to fight back.

400
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:30,432
Anybody follow you here?
- No.

401
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:36,507
Okay, come on, you
stay here tonight.

402
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:38,643
In the mornin', I'll go
out and scout around.

403
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:40,711
See what they're up to.

404
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:43,414
Get some rest, you're exhausted.

405
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:45,514
It's alright.

406
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:19,548
Why do men have to fight?

407
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,755
It's always been
about who gets more.

408
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:29,658
It has to change.

409
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:34,131
It's been that way
for thousands of years.

410
00:40:35,065 --> 00:40:37,065
But it must change.

411
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:23,131
Good morning.
- Shh!

412
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:27,571
Get dressed.
- What's the matter?

413
00:43:27,671 --> 00:43:29,273
We've got half a
minute to save our ass.

414
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:30,642
You know how to use this?
- Yeah.

415
00:43:30,742 --> 00:43:32,910
Use it when the time
comes, I'll be back.

416
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,079
Hunter, this is Straker.

417
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:40,117
Send the girl out and
you will not be harmed.

418
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:07,478
Go!

419
00:44:08,712 --> 00:44:10,712
Hi, boys.

420
00:44:34,405 --> 00:44:36,405
Come on, get dressed!
- I'm ready!

421
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:42,044
Get on the bike.
- Okay!

422
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:52,988
Come on!

423
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,833
Hang on!

424
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:08,837
Don't shoot, you'll hit the girl.

425
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:21,885
Bone!

426
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:23,987
Yes, sir!

427
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:27,758
That sucker isn't
gonna live here anymore.

428
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:29,858
Get in.

429
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:07,062
Clear the area.

430
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:27,849
Faster!

431
00:46:58,782 --> 00:47:00,782
Throw this.

432
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:06,657
Try again.

433
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,409
I got him!

434
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:38,088
Throw it by that tree!

435
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:21,565
He always leaves
a garrison behind.

436
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,233
Yeah, he's a real pro.

437
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:33,378
What'd you do to this?

438
00:48:33,478 --> 00:48:35,679
I looked through them.

439
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:39,883
That'll teach me not to
loan out my binoculars.

440
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:53,430
Get off your ass and
help these people, come on.

441
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:55,530
Move, move!

442
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:58,335
Where's he sleep?

443
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,138
Locked up inside the truck.

444
00:49:00,238 --> 00:49:02,572
If he didn't, he'd get a
knife through his ribs.

445
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:09,579
Okay, I've seen enough, let's go.

446
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:00,795
Why didn't you tell us the truth?

447
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:03,531
I couldn't.

448
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:10,808
Five good men
died because of you.

449
00:50:10,908 --> 00:50:13,143
Maybe Straker'll go
easy on us if we send her back!

450
00:50:13,243 --> 00:50:14,879
That's it, we'll send her back.

451
00:50:14,979 --> 00:50:17,214
You're not sending
anybody anywhere.

452
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:27,190
We can't sacrifice the whole
community for one person.

453
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:31,629
He would have come here anyway,

454
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:34,831
but if you don't want
me here, I'll go.

455
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:45,342
Wait a minute, you're
not goin' anywhere.

456
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:50,614
You people better make up your
minds what you're gonna do.

457
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,714
I know what I'm gonna do.

458
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:30,121
I thought they'd killed you.

459
00:51:30,221 --> 00:51:32,222
Well, we got a
couple of them instead.

460
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:39,529
I told 'em where to find you.

461
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:43,166
I know, you were
the only one who knew.

462
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:48,271
They, they took
my hand and put...

463
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:52,307
I just wanted the pain to stop.

464
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:10,460
Forget it, Rusty, I know torture.

465
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:12,560
Nobody holds out.

466
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:17,134
You could've.
- No.

467
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:19,234
I'd have done the
same thing you did.

468
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:22,237
Maybe, maybe not.

469
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:27,644
No blame, understand?

470
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,151
No blame.

471
00:52:33,251 --> 00:52:35,619
I'm gonna need your help,
you're gonna have to make me

472
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:38,188
some kind of
light-armored vehicle.

473
00:52:38,288 --> 00:52:40,288
Can you still make explosives?

474
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:44,259
Yeah, sure.

475
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:46,631
Yeah, I got some sulfuric left,

476
00:52:46,731 --> 00:52:49,032
and I can make a
still for the nitric.

477
00:52:51,034 --> 00:52:51,768
My hand.

478
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:53,868
Use mine.

479
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:58,742
I've been watchin' real close,
I can do all your stuff.

480
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:01,945
You always said I
have good hands.

481
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:02,879
Alright.

482
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,248
Alright!

483
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,348
Follow me.

484
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:12,155
We'll take this
manifold into the shop.

485
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:16,092
Corlie, grab a hold of this.

486
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:18,192
Here, take this spring too.

487
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:24,234
Come on, Hunter, grab
that spring, let's go!

488
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:25,735
I think I've got
some bulletproof glass

489
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:27,835
around here somewhere.

490
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:09,279
Hunter.

491
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,582
I've been thinkin'.
- Yeah?

492
00:54:11,682 --> 00:54:13,984
You're right, we've gotta fight.

493
00:54:15,785 --> 00:54:18,054
I'd like to help you,
if you'll have me.

494
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:20,154
There's plenty to do.

495
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:35,939
We've been right
through that area.

496
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:38,039
Nobody's been in there for years.

497
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:41,111
Motorcycles don't
grow wings and fly away.

498
00:54:41,211 --> 00:54:43,211
I want you to find him.

499
00:54:44,748 --> 00:54:46,748
Hey, Boss!

500
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,753
I caught these dirt-eaters
tryin' to sneak up on us.

501
00:54:48,853 --> 00:54:50,754
What're you boys up to?

502
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:52,656
We live around
here, what's it to ya?

503
00:54:52,756 --> 00:54:54,257
Well, that's fair enough.

504
00:54:54,357 --> 00:54:55,191
Shoot 'em!

505
00:54:56,426 --> 00:54:58,662
He's only jokin' ya.

506
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,629
Go on home.

507
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:29,123
What a mess.

508
00:55:34,397 --> 00:55:37,000
That son of a bitch!

509
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:41,404
Be sure it's not damp.
- It's not damp.

510
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:43,473
I hope you're right.

511
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:46,443
Those firing pins are
pretty unpredictable.

512
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:49,777
I got it.

513
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:25,580
Did you get the...

514
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:28,251
I didn't knock
in case you were asleep.

515
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:29,487
I hope I didn't frighten you.

516
00:56:29,587 --> 00:56:31,655
No, it's just that I
thought you were Hunter.

517
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:33,257
He should be back any minute.

518
00:56:33,357 --> 00:56:35,392
Yeah, he's been
workin' like a dog.

519
00:56:36,526 --> 00:56:38,526
We all have.

520
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,499
Would you like a cup of tea?
- No, thanks.

521
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:44,599
I came to apologize.

522
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:47,168
I'm ashamed about
the way I acted.

523
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:49,804
Do you forgive me?

524
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:53,176
I suppose so.

525
00:56:53,276 --> 00:56:55,276
Hey, maybe I will
have that cup of tea.

526
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:13,029
You know, I used to have
such a different life.

527
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:16,232
We all did, before
it all fell apart.

528
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:18,635
If I'd only met you then,

529
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:20,735
we might've really had somethin'.

530
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,900
Yeah, hee-yah, hee-yah!

531
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:50,426
More water, get
some more water, somebody!

532
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:57,167
Alvin!
- Corlie's in there.

533
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:58,669
Corlie!
- No, no, Alvin, no!

534
00:58:58,769 --> 00:59:02,639
We've gotta get her out!
- Corlie's not in there!

535
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:06,176
She was kidnapped by Judd.

536
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:09,212
Bastard!
- Come on, save the barn!

537
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,213
Give me that!

538
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:39,709
Where's Corlie?
- Don't worry, she's alive.

539
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:41,311
Judd took her in the truck board.

540
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,411
How long ago?
- Hours.

541
01:00:58,855 --> 01:01:00,523
Yee-come on!

542
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:02,623
Yee!

543
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:39,896
We have unfinished
to take care of.

544
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:01,041
I guess that's the
last we'll of him.

545
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:08,885
Hee-yah!

546
01:03:08,985 --> 01:03:10,119
Giddup!

547
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:12,219
Hee-yah!

548
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:31,338
Get out.
- Hey, take it easy.

549
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:34,811
I've come to see Straker.
- Yeah?

550
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:36,911
I've got a little surprise.

551
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:41,649
Open the gate.

552
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:47,590
Hee-yah, come on!

553
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:08,511
Morning, sir.
- News from Clearwater.

554
01:04:10,846 --> 01:04:13,182
So what does my little
bird have to tell me today?

555
01:04:13,282 --> 01:04:15,451
I thought you'd like
to know Hunter is dead.

556
01:04:15,551 --> 01:04:17,720
Is that right?

557
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:18,621
So?

558
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:20,656
Well, he tried to stop me

559
01:04:20,756 --> 01:04:22,756
when I was bringing
you a little gift.

560
01:04:23,226 --> 01:04:25,226
Sir.

561
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:40,076
Bone, take her to my quarters.

562
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:41,811
Hell, why don't
you just let her go?

563
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:43,911
She's more trouble than...

564
01:04:45,815 --> 01:04:46,949
Yes, sir.

565
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:49,049
Sorry, sir.

566
01:04:50,686 --> 01:04:53,389
You know, you're a very
clever fellow, you know that?

567
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:56,225
I'm awfully tired
of smelling manure.

568
01:04:56,325 --> 01:04:57,761
Well, I can understand that.

569
01:04:57,861 --> 01:04:59,962
You know, my mind
is wasted on those people.

570
01:05:00,062 --> 01:05:01,298
Let's go in here.

571
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:03,866
I'm wanna tell ya,
I have some plans.

572
01:05:03,966 --> 01:05:05,966
Some great plans.

573
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:13,709
Why have you done this for me?
- I knew you'd appreciate it.

574
01:05:16,846 --> 01:05:18,848
How'd you get
the scratches on your face?

575
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:21,083
She resisted!

576
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:23,183
How dare you touch her.

577
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:29,592
If you ever so much as even
think you're gonna look at her,

578
01:05:29,692 --> 01:05:31,827
I'm gonna cut you in little
pieces and feed you to yourself.

579
01:05:31,927 --> 01:05:33,529
Do you hear me?
- I promise, I promise.

580
01:05:33,629 --> 01:05:35,629
Let go of me!

581
01:05:37,867 --> 01:05:38,701
So...

582
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:42,972
You wanna join my little band?

583
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:48,409
Welcome to the club.

584
01:07:02,385 --> 01:07:04,854
Right here, it's
right here, slow down.

585
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:10,059
Right down there,
right down there.

586
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:27,009
I know I hit him, I saw
him fall right there.

587
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:33,382
Nothin' there now, mate.

588
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:35,482
Do I kill him, Boss?

589
01:07:36,619 --> 01:07:38,554
He rolled all the
way down that hill.

590
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:41,957
He was dead, I'm tellin' ya!
- Come on, handsome.

591
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:56,972
Hey, Hunter's back!

592
01:07:57,072 --> 01:07:59,072
Hunter's come back!

593
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:15,925
Quick, carry him inside.

594
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:41,081
Judd did this?
- Yeah.

595
01:08:45,354 --> 01:08:48,057
It's lodged.
- Yeah, I know.

596
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:50,157
Hang on.

597
01:08:56,699 --> 01:08:58,968
It's a septic wound, isn't
there any alcohol left?

598
01:08:59,068 --> 01:09:01,270
No, they took it all,
and the sulfur powder.

599
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:03,106
All we've got left
is creek water.

600
01:09:03,206 --> 01:09:05,341
You might fight off the
infection in a week or two, but...

601
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:07,510
No, I've gotta be
on my feet tomorrow.

602
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:09,779
They'll be after
me, might come here.

603
01:09:09,879 --> 01:09:11,447
I can cure arthritis and boils,

604
01:09:11,547 --> 01:09:13,215
but this is a deep septic wound.

605
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:14,450
Cauterize it.

606
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:16,353
Maybe it'll heal all by itself.

607
01:09:16,453 --> 01:09:18,654
No, Alvin, he's right.

608
01:09:29,231 --> 01:09:31,231
Are you ready?

609
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:44,711
Thanks.

610
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:00,761
I'll never stay with you.

611
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:08,602
You can't own me.

612
01:10:14,276 --> 01:10:16,276
Kill me or let me go.

613
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:23,519
Your beauty is from your mother,

614
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:26,855
but your fire and your
passion, those are from me.

615
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:31,527
I can't stay with
you, you know that.

616
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:33,963
No, I don't.

617
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:35,431
Hunter will kill you.

618
01:10:35,531 --> 01:10:37,531
Don't be a child.

619
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:41,003
I wish I could kill you.

620
01:10:41,103 --> 01:10:43,939
We love to kill, so
we kill what we love.

621
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:46,039
Is that it?

622
01:10:47,009 --> 01:10:49,009
No.

623
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:56,585
Or are we mirror
images, you and I?

624
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:00,220
My blood.

625
01:11:00,389 --> 01:11:02,389
My inheritor.

626
01:11:03,892 --> 01:11:05,892
My immortality.

627
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:08,528
I don't know anymore.

628
01:11:20,976 --> 01:11:23,979
I believe you
lost this, princess.

629
01:12:29,344 --> 01:12:31,080
How do you feel this morning?

630
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,180
When will it be ready to roll?

631
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:36,852
Well, we need some
time for some tests...

632
01:12:36,952 --> 01:12:38,952
How soon before the engine runs?

633
01:12:40,222 --> 01:12:41,724
A couple hours at least.

634
01:12:41,824 --> 01:12:43,824
Just get it
running, I'll test it.

635
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,860
Hunter.

636
01:12:47,162 --> 01:12:49,098
Are you crazy, you've lost
a lot of blood, you know?

637
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:51,200
Just get that
engine runnin', okay?

638
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:05,347
And the automatic choker's
shot, so I put in a manual one.

639
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:07,150
But the methane
heats up pretty quick.

640
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:10,319
Now, the tack's not calibrated,
so do your RPMs by ear.

641
01:13:10,419 --> 01:13:14,757
I know how to drive, just
be there when I need you.

642
01:13:14,857 --> 01:13:16,859
We'll be here!

643
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:19,862
Don't you worry about us, you
just make sure you're there!

644
01:13:39,748 --> 01:13:42,117
I hope it holds together.

645
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:44,217
Bye, Hunter!

646
01:14:24,459 --> 01:14:26,595
What the hell was that?

647
01:14:26,695 --> 01:14:28,695
Hey, you, shoot it!

648
01:14:29,932 --> 01:14:31,967
I'm off!

649
01:14:55,991 --> 01:14:57,359
Bone, Bo!

650
01:14:57,459 --> 01:14:58,861
Shit, what's goin' on?

651
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:00,463
The truck, Willie, get
up, come on that truck!

652
01:15:00,563 --> 01:15:05,567
Where's Straker?

653
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:49,678
Look out!

654
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:02,722
Bone!

655
01:16:03,258 --> 01:16:05,327
Get the gun crewed, wind
her up, we're rollin'.

656
01:16:05,427 --> 01:16:07,596
Where are we goin'?
- I'm gonna kill him!

657
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:19,242
Willie!
- Yeah, Boss?

658
01:16:19,342 --> 01:16:22,678
Get in the truck,
we're goin', Willie.

659
01:17:09,091 --> 01:17:11,091
Faster, I want more.

660
01:17:11,893 --> 01:17:13,893
She's doing all she can.
- I said more!

661
01:17:37,786 --> 01:17:40,155
She's not gonna make
it, I'm not gonna let you

662
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:41,624
do it to her, you're not
gonna wreck my truck.

663
01:17:41,724 --> 01:17:44,760
It's not your truck, dumb-ass,
you're just the driver.

664
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:46,962
I think he's right, Boss, I
think he's right, I'm scared.

665
01:17:47,062 --> 01:17:48,730
Not now, Willie.
- The truck might blow.

666
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:50,830
Not now!

667
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:17,459
Come on, Bone, come on!
- I can't push her anymore!

668
01:18:17,559 --> 01:18:20,362
She's coming up to overheat now.

669
01:18:20,462 --> 01:18:21,998
I never had a chance to
pull that service on her.

670
01:18:22,098 --> 01:18:24,232
Shut up and drive.
- I know, Boss, I know.

671
01:18:24,332 --> 01:18:25,567
If we go back... Shut up, Willie!

672
01:18:25,667 --> 01:18:27,036
But if we go back and
go round the other...

673
01:18:27,136 --> 01:18:29,237
Knock it off, jelly belly,
I got a gut full of you!

674
01:18:29,337 --> 01:18:31,974
Now, shut up, do you understand?

675
01:18:32,074 --> 01:18:34,074
Drive!

676
01:18:45,787 --> 01:18:47,787
Rusty!

677
01:18:50,092 --> 01:18:52,761
He fell for it, meet you on top!

678
01:19:16,118 --> 01:19:17,820
She's overheating, we
gotta pull the turbines.

679
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,821
Keep rolling.
- He'll come back for me.

680
01:19:19,921 --> 01:19:21,921
And he'll beat you
because he's better.

681
01:19:22,991 --> 01:19:24,991
Over my dead body.

682
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:08,870
Now for the rocket launcher.
- Your wound's open.

683
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:10,939
Hurry up, it's comin'!

684
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:14,042
I got that, get
that other rocket.

685
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:32,861
Shit!

686
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:34,129
Reload.

687
01:20:34,229 --> 01:20:36,229
Where is he?

688
01:20:44,206 --> 01:20:46,241
Do something!
- Shut up.

689
01:20:48,109 --> 01:20:50,912
Do something.
- Get off, get off!

690
01:20:53,748 --> 01:20:55,748
Put that fire out.

691
01:20:56,551 --> 01:20:58,551
They've just blown the roof.

692
01:20:58,787 --> 01:20:59,922
Keep going.

693
01:21:00,022 --> 01:21:02,791
You're running away.
- Don't be stupid.

694
01:21:02,891 --> 01:21:04,891
We're going to
flatten Clearwater.

695
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:09,131
Help me on with this.
- You can't, you're too weak.

696
01:21:09,231 --> 01:21:11,299
What're you gonna on a
bike against that truck?

697
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:13,399
Whatever it takes.

698
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:18,705
He's taking the turnoff.

699
01:21:19,774 --> 01:21:21,774
I guess that's the
end of Clearwater.

700
01:21:30,685 --> 01:21:32,685
Good luck.

701
01:23:20,495 --> 01:23:23,265
I'm not gonna let
that bastard run my truck.

702
01:23:23,365 --> 01:23:26,234
No, it's my truck, Straker!

703
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:32,772
You drive.

704
01:23:35,577 --> 01:23:37,577
Drive!

705
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:51,290
Keep it on the road.

706
01:24:00,368 --> 01:24:02,437
I saved you, Boss, didn't I?

707
01:24:02,537 --> 01:24:04,537
I saved...

708
01:24:05,039 --> 01:24:07,039
Your time is over, old man.

709
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:10,578
Not yet, kid.

710
01:24:10,678 --> 01:24:12,678
Kill him!

711
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:17,350
Hunter, kill him!

712
01:24:23,258 --> 01:24:24,693
"Old man,"

713
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:26,793
I'll show you.

714
01:24:27,996 --> 01:24:29,996
No!

715
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,970
Daddy, would you stop it!

716
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:37,070
Stop it!

717
01:24:40,875 --> 01:24:45,880
Let's get outta here.

718
01:24:58,293 --> 01:25:00,293
Now!

719
01:25:10,405 --> 01:25:12,405
I'll kill you!

720
01:27:32,814 --> 01:27:34,814
Goodbye, my friend.

721
01:27:35,617 --> 01:27:37,617
Thanks.

722
01:27:40,521 --> 01:27:43,258
Look after yourself.

723
01:27:56,404 --> 01:27:58,404
I really thought you'd stay.

724
01:27:59,140 --> 01:27:59,974
I'll be back.

725
01:28:00,975 --> 01:28:01,809
When?

726
01:28:03,044 --> 01:28:05,044
Sometime.
