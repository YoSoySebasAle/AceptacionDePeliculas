1
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,500
It's your fault.

2
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,500
- You are not allowed to leave alone!
- Okey, auntie.

3
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,500
Clean them later.

4
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:42,208
Whoever has dirty shoes is half human.

5
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,708
<i> COME FOR ME <i/>

6
00:06:35,917 --> 00:06:37,625
Eat, please!

7
00:06:39,917 --> 00:06:42,500
You'll be here only for a while.

8
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,417
I want to go home!

9
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:16,833
I want to go home!

10
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,833
- He captivated the cows.
- He poisoned the water.

11
00:14:32,042 --> 00:14:33,750
People like him attract evil spirits.

12
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:37,750
- He can count man's teeth...
- We have to kill him! - Drown him!

13
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:41,042
- They can't swim.
- Burn him!

14
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,750
Limb of the devil!

15
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:56,792
Black demon eyes.

16
00:14:58,917 --> 00:15:02,208
In dealings with the devil.

17
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,833
Can bring the death.

18
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:20,917
Yes, he is a vampire.

19
00:15:28,042 --> 00:15:30,042
I'm buying him.

20
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:08,542
Next time you will try harder.

21
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:51,333
Mix well.

22
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:11,667
The unclean spirit will drink the blood...

23
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:15,333
then will find his own kind.

24
00:22:15,458 --> 00:22:21,167
Evil force will turn into black mud.

25
00:28:49,583 --> 00:28:52,833
He will bring only bad luck.

26
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,583
Son of a bitch!

27
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:35,833
Our boy is gone.

28
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:52,792
Try it on.

29
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:10,667
You whore!
You bitch!

30
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:13,750
What's the fuck is going on between you two?

31
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,583
Whore!

32
00:31:19,792 --> 00:31:23,208
You wanted another brat?!

33
00:31:23,292 --> 00:31:26,042
You whore!
You bitch!

34
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:34,292
Why is he staring at you like that?
What?

35
00:31:37,458 --> 00:31:40,958
You whore!
You bitch!

36
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:45,667
I'm too old for you?!

37
00:31:46,292 --> 00:31:49,792
You fucking bitch!

38
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:48,792
Lord Jesus...

39
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:53,250
Thank you for your kindness and generosity...

40
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:58,583
and for the time when you watch over us.
Amen.

41
00:37:10,333 --> 00:37:12,875
You dirty pig!

42
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:16,042
You want to fuck my wife?

43
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:18,875
You boar!

44
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,208
Pig!

45
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:43,000
You won't be staring at her anymore!

46
00:37:43,792 --> 00:37:45,667
Get the fuck out!

47
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:10,708
You whore!

48
00:38:13,417 --> 00:38:15,292
You bitch!

49
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:17,708
Whore!

50
00:43:16,792 --> 00:43:19,917
Are you gypsy?

51
00:43:23,292 --> 00:43:26,375
You know how to cross yourself?

52
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,125
Good.

53
00:43:57,792 --> 00:44:02,250
Hang it up higher!
Above!

54
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:29,542
Boy!

55
00:44:39,708 --> 00:44:41,917
Come here.

56
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:39,500
Against evil spirits.

57
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,667
You'll be sitting here.

58
00:48:10,833 --> 00:48:14,375
We will definitely sell some of them.

59
00:53:57,125 --> 00:54:01,000
You want to fuck with our children,
you horny bitch?!

60
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:06,542
- You fucking whore!
- You bitch!

61
00:54:11,542 --> 00:54:15,542
You won't get away with it, you slut!

62
00:54:29,583 --> 00:54:32,375
Now you will see, you cunt!

63
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,333
Take this!

64
00:58:21,958 --> 00:58:26,167
Don't be afraid, horsie,
I'll take care of you.

65
00:59:50,833 --> 00:59:53,875
Where did he find him?

66
01:00:09,042 --> 01:00:10,542
No!

67
01:00:11,542 --> 01:00:13,042
No.

68
01:00:13,167 --> 01:00:17,375
- No!
- Don't bother!

69
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:55,333
- Leave it to us.
- Down!

70
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:06,208
Krauts will appreciate it.

71
01:05:10,167 --> 01:05:14,750
We need to go to this village.

72
01:06:50,333 --> 01:06:51,875
Stop!

73
01:07:48,458 --> 01:07:52,500
What is going on?

74
01:07:57,583 --> 01:08:03,167
We have one Jew for you.

75
01:08:03,583 --> 01:08:07,750
We caught him in the woods.

76
01:08:31,958 --> 01:08:34,375
You need a volunteer!

77
01:14:30,375 --> 01:14:33,417
Stop!

78
01:14:35,083 --> 01:14:36,708
Stop!

79
01:19:04,083 --> 01:19:06,708
They're bringing some more!

80
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:42,000
A disgusting pig!

81
01:19:42,042 --> 01:19:46,083
Die, pig!

82
01:19:46,125 --> 01:19:50,875
Pig!

83
01:21:07,208 --> 01:21:09,958
Pig.

84
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,333
Take him away.

85
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:13,000
Jesus took on himself all the sins of the world...

86
01:22:13,417 --> 01:22:18,208
to redeem us and save us through his death.

87
01:22:18,417 --> 01:22:21,083
Then he ascended to heaven...

88
01:22:21,125 --> 01:22:24,583
and sits at the right side of the God.

89
01:22:24,917 --> 01:22:28,500
He suffered at the hands of many people.

90
01:22:28,792 --> 01:22:31,417
Just like you.

91
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,708
I believe you.

92
01:22:36,708 --> 01:22:40,000
You can do it today.

93
01:23:11,208 --> 01:23:17,167
In the name of father and son and holy spirit.
Amen.

94
01:23:58,917 --> 01:24:00,417
Father?

95
01:24:02,125 --> 01:24:04,375
Can I come in?

96
01:24:38,333 --> 01:24:40,417
Silence! Quiet!

97
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,500
Stop it!

98
01:24:42,708 --> 01:24:44,417
Father…

99
01:25:13,333 --> 01:25:18,000
- I'm getting worse.
- I'm very sorry.

100
01:25:19,625 --> 01:25:25,000
God bless you for your noble offer.

101
01:25:25,208 --> 01:25:31,167
Our master will reward you for your goodness.

102
01:25:38,917 --> 01:25:43,125
You'll like it here.

103
01:26:18,833 --> 01:26:22,833
So are you on your way home?

104
01:26:32,917 --> 01:26:35,125
And where is your house?

105
01:26:43,917 --> 01:26:45,750
Eat.

106
01:26:47,125 --> 01:26:49,667
You must have strength.

107
01:30:47,042 --> 01:30:49,792
I'll take three.

108
01:31:40,917 --> 01:31:45,125
The boy must start going to church again.

109
01:31:45,542 --> 01:31:49,083
- I think...
- You haven't been at holy confession...

110
01:31:49,375 --> 01:31:51,458
for a long time.

111
01:32:53,833 --> 01:32:56,125
Sit down!

112
01:33:03,542 --> 01:33:06,583
You'll be quiet...

113
01:33:07,542 --> 01:33:10,917
or I'll kill you.

114
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:40,542
- My respect.
- And mine.

115
01:33:40,583 --> 01:33:42,375
See you soon.

116
01:34:22,042 --> 01:34:24,583
Let's pray.

117
01:35:40,833 --> 01:35:46,750
I'm glad you look after him so well.

118
01:35:48,042 --> 01:35:49,833
Father.

119
01:35:53,333 --> 01:35:56,833
Read him the Bible every evening...

120
01:35:57,625 --> 01:36:00,417
and yourself too.

121
01:36:06,458 --> 01:36:09,375
I warned you.

122
01:36:32,833 --> 01:36:37,167
Where did you get it from?
Talk!

123
01:36:37,958 --> 01:36:40,625
Where did you get it?!

124
01:38:17,417 --> 01:38:21,417
Our Father, Who art in heaven…

125
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:45,667
I've heard about you before.

126
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:09,042
- Hold him!
- You Satan!

127
01:40:10,667 --> 01:40:13,292
You devil!

128
01:47:02,958 --> 01:47:05,750
You were lucky.

129
01:47:09,875 --> 01:47:12,042
Where you come from?

130
01:47:17,583 --> 01:47:19,583
Are you mute?

131
01:47:32,458 --> 01:47:34,750
You can stay here.

132
01:47:35,083 --> 01:47:37,375
If you want to.

133
01:49:39,583 --> 01:49:41,875
Close the door.

134
01:49:56,875 --> 01:49:59,208
Come to me.

135
01:50:27,667 --> 01:50:30,083
Kiss my legs.

136
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:41,333
Do you think I can't cut myself?

137
01:56:50,208 --> 01:56:52,375
You're useless!

138
02:01:15,125 --> 02:01:18,000
There is no time!
Remove this car now!

139
02:02:28,792 --> 02:02:31,708
Cossacks!

140
02:05:16,625 --> 02:05:20,708
Run away!

141
02:07:31,333 --> 02:07:34,250
You're not from here, right?

142
02:07:42,417 --> 02:07:44,833
Where are your parents?

143
02:07:55,042 --> 02:07:57,958
So an orphan.

144
02:09:38,042 --> 02:09:40,500
The boy is an orphan.

145
02:09:42,042 --> 02:09:44,833
He will stay with us for now.

146
02:11:50,250 --> 02:11:52,417
It fits like a glove.

147
02:12:06,333 --> 02:12:08,542
The party is like a train...

148
02:12:08,583 --> 02:12:11,833
in which Stalin is a machinist.

149
02:12:12,125 --> 02:12:13,750
Understand?

150
02:12:22,250 --> 02:12:24,500
Am I wrong?

151
02:14:03,792 --> 02:14:07,000
What is it?
What happened?

152
02:14:25,542 --> 02:14:29,375
Was the order not clear enough?!

153
02:14:33,250 --> 02:14:38,250
Not the fuck to leave the camp!

154
02:14:42,250 --> 02:14:46,958
Do not contact local hostile people!

155
02:14:47,125 --> 02:14:50,083
Especially their women.

156
02:14:51,125 --> 02:14:53,333
Silent!

157
02:14:54,625 --> 02:14:58,208
Get the paramedic, fast!

158
02:14:58,958 --> 02:15:02,792
Others... split up!

159
02:22:14,667 --> 02:22:17,292
Remember…

160
02:22:19,375 --> 02:22:23,125
An eye for an eye.
A tooth for a tooth.

161
02:22:48,958 --> 02:22:52,000
Act as real communist.

162
02:23:14,958 --> 02:23:16,458
Then.

163
02:23:23,583 --> 02:23:25,583
Time will come.

164
02:24:25,083 --> 02:24:26,667
Name?

165
02:24:32,667 --> 02:24:35,750
Place of birth?
Date?

166
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:17,375
You wanted to steal it?!

167
02:29:18,292 --> 02:29:22,042
Don't you understand, dirty Jew?

168
02:29:22,292 --> 02:29:24,375
What?

169
02:29:24,500 --> 02:29:28,667
The best place for those like you
is behind barbed wire!

170
02:32:16,083 --> 02:32:17,792
Wait here!

171
02:34:26,792 --> 02:34:29,583
We will cook cabbage soup.

172
02:34:30,708 --> 02:34:32,875
The way you like it.

173
02:34:37,083 --> 02:34:39,208
Do you remember?

174
02:34:46,708 --> 02:34:51,458
I know, it's not very nice here.

175
02:34:52,208 --> 02:34:55,667
But I couldn't get anything better yet.

176
02:34:58,792 --> 02:35:01,125
We will leave tomorrow.

177
02:35:27,542 --> 02:35:29,417
You don't like it?

178
02:35:37,792 --> 02:35:41,083
Maybe you want salt?
We have some.

179
02:36:02,208 --> 02:36:04,583
When we get back home...

180
02:36:04,708 --> 02:36:08,792
I'll buy you some decent clothes.
How about that?

181
02:36:22,792 --> 02:36:26,333
Mum is waiting for us impatiently.

182
02:36:38,500 --> 02:36:40,000
You know…

183
02:36:41,292 --> 02:36:44,083
we thought you would be safe there.

184
02:36:45,292 --> 02:36:47,500
We couldn't…

185
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,125
There was no other option.

186
02:37:00,708 --> 02:37:02,917
Wait!

187
02:37:04,917 --> 02:37:09,875
Do you at least remember your name?

188
02:40:44,083 --> 02:40:49,208
