1
00:03:02,947 --> 00:03:03,823
Hello, Jack.

2
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:06,413
I guess I'm the last person
in the world you wanna see.

3
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:09,653
<i>That's usually a pretty good guess.
What's goin' on here?</i>

4
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:10,815
Jack, I'm pullin' you down the line.

5
00:03:10,882 --> 00:03:12,586
There's some place you have to be now.

6
00:03:12,653 --> 00:03:14,304
<i>Jennings, that sounds like an order.</i>

7
00:03:14,371 --> 00:03:16,167
Since I'm a senior
member of the council,

8
00:03:16,234 --> 00:03:17,387
you're damn right it is.

9
00:03:19,196 --> 00:03:22,509
<i>Can't you just let it slide
until I've singed my last trancer?</i>

10
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,778
<i>Where the hell you sending me this time?</i>

11
00:03:24,845 --> 00:03:27,972
It's about your daughter
and your non-future.

12
00:03:28,685 --> 00:03:30,203
<i>What the hell are you talkin' about?</i>

13
00:03:31,317 --> 00:03:32,757
<i>God damn it, stop it!</i>

14
00:03:32,824 --> 00:03:34,023
Surprise, Jack!

15
00:03:34,393 --> 00:03:36,560
You're goin' down the line now.

16
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:39,192
<i>Wait a minute, that's not what you...</i>

17
00:04:16,328 --> 00:04:17,347
Oh wow.

18
00:04:17,808 --> 00:04:19,340
Second pass at...

19
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:23,848
10,

20
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:26,822
43, 44 seconds,

21
00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:29,878
vector 28,

22
00:04:30,906 --> 00:04:35,679
declamation 124.

23
00:04:41,273 --> 00:04:43,193
Hi, it's me. Did you see it?

24
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:47,304
I'll be by tomorrow for
a confirmation report.

25
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,420
Thanks a lot, Doc.

26
00:04:51,309 --> 00:04:52,557
What do you mean, be careful?

27
00:04:54,049 --> 00:04:54,882
Really?

28
00:04:56,493 --> 00:04:57,410
Are you okay?

29
00:04:59,147 --> 00:05:02,099
Well but why would anyone be
upset that we saw the meteor?

30
00:05:03,716 --> 00:05:06,010
No, no I'll be by tomorrow.

31
00:05:06,086 --> 00:05:06,919
Okay, bye.

32
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:14,287
Hello.

33
00:05:15,007 --> 00:05:15,952
Hello.

34
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,330
Hello.

35
00:05:18,857 --> 00:05:19,690
Shoot!

36
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,035
Please don't stain.

37
00:05:24,172 --> 00:05:25,528
Please don't stain.

38
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,365
I need my cleaning deposit
back, thank you very much.

39
00:05:49,387 --> 00:05:51,539
That was an ass breaker of a ride.

40
00:05:53,124 --> 00:05:55,112
Too old to be goin' up and
down the line like this.

41
00:05:55,179 --> 00:05:56,610
I'm gonna kill Jennings.

42
00:06:00,018 --> 00:06:02,063
Shit, I need to clear my head.

43
00:06:02,675 --> 00:06:05,071
There's gotta be a shot of
booze around here some place.

44
00:06:14,179 --> 00:06:15,383
Oh God.

45
00:06:22,186 --> 00:06:23,864
Squid soda.

46
00:06:39,138 --> 00:06:40,196
My God.

47
00:06:44,069 --> 00:06:45,566
No,

48
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:49,768
no, no Jennings,
I'm gonna tear you apart!

49
00:07:13,865 --> 00:07:14,711
Explain yourself, Toots.

50
00:07:14,778 --> 00:07:16,783
You'll be turnin' tricks
at the pearly gates.

51
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:18,736
Let go of me, Trooper Deth.

52
00:07:18,886 --> 00:07:20,939
You know, you should really
work on your technique.

53
00:07:21,006 --> 00:07:21,923
Jennings.

54
00:07:23,363 --> 00:07:26,717
That's right, my great
great great grandma was a ho.

55
00:07:26,784 --> 00:07:28,951
I hope I don't look
surprised because I'm not.

56
00:07:29,017 --> 00:07:30,068
Very funny.

57
00:07:30,135 --> 00:07:32,349
Look, just don't go
blab to the council, okay?

58
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:33,943
You know the tight asses they can be.

59
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,382
If you'd tell me what
the hell is going on.

60
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:37,472
Whose body am I in?

61
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:39,181
It's your daughter, Jack.

62
00:07:42,536 --> 00:07:44,841
You better start explaining now.

63
00:07:44,908 --> 00:07:47,742
I was doing a standard
monitor of the time continuum,

64
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:51,131
just to make sure everything
was at it should be.

65
00:07:51,197 --> 00:07:52,401
We've gone down the line so many times,

66
00:07:52,467 --> 00:07:54,982
I'm surprised all of history
isn't out of whack.

67
00:07:56,262 --> 00:07:58,082
Your history might be, Jack.

68
00:07:58,557 --> 00:07:59,557
Take a look.

69
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,324
When you left Lena back
in Old Los Angeles,

70
00:08:04,391 --> 00:08:06,775
she was pregnant with your daughter.

71
00:08:06,841 --> 00:08:08,437
When you met the child,
Lena let you believe...

72
00:08:08,504 --> 00:08:12,128
...that someone else was the father
in order to spare your feelings.

73
00:08:12,195 --> 00:08:14,703
Well, I did a DNA trace, and she's yours.

74
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:17,559
Otherwise, you couldn't
be in her body right now.

75
00:08:18,827 --> 00:08:20,468
Guess these time travel paradoxes...

76
00:08:20,535 --> 00:08:23,706
...have finally gone
from the ridiculous to the sublime.

77
00:08:23,772 --> 00:08:25,092
Not really.

78
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:28,470
She's in trouble, or should
I say, you're in trouble.

79
00:08:28,712 --> 00:08:31,175
Last time I was here,
I wiped out all the trancers.

80
00:08:31,242 --> 00:08:32,760
We don't know who or why.

81
00:08:32,826 --> 00:08:34,624
I grabbed these images from the time belt,

82
00:08:34,691 --> 00:08:36,434
and they show the girl
fighting for her life.

83
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:39,838
If she loses, then you're erased.

84
00:08:39,905 --> 00:08:43,134
I mean, she exists in the past,
or well, right now,

85
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:46,073
so eventually her descendants
will be your parents.

86
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,214
Congratulations, Jack.

87
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:50,110
You've just fathered your own
great great great grandmother.

88
00:08:50,176 --> 00:08:52,817
Jesus, could you have
screwed this up anymore?

89
00:08:52,883 --> 00:08:54,566
I can't even get my brain around this.

90
00:08:54,632 --> 00:08:55,813
Then think of it this way.

91
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,824
Someone is trying to kill your daughter,

92
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,566
and I think it's a trancer.

93
00:08:59,697 --> 00:09:02,496
Maybe you should be a dad,
stay in her body, and save her.

94
00:09:02,562 --> 00:09:03,826
Full reinstatement?

95
00:09:04,623 --> 00:09:07,372
Lieutenant Jack Deth, you are
once again a trancer hunter,

96
00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:08,500
first class.

97
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,443
I don't know what your
daughter's gotten herself into.

98
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,608
You have to find that out on your own.

99
00:09:15,342 --> 00:09:16,586
Shouldn't be too hard,

100
00:09:16,653 --> 00:09:19,778
singe a few trancers, be back by supper,
you're buyin'.

101
00:09:19,845 --> 00:09:20,697
Deal.

102
00:09:21,249 --> 00:09:24,510
Oh Jennings, if you need
some cash before you go back,

103
00:09:24,577 --> 00:09:25,924
there's a convention in town.

104
00:09:25,991 --> 00:09:27,614
Just don't screw this up, Jack.

105
00:09:27,681 --> 00:09:30,652
Your daughter's life
and yours depends on it.

106
00:10:14,217 --> 00:10:15,533
Okay, honey,

107
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,359
I'm gonna start off with your boss.

108
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,424
See if I have to kill him or not.

109
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:21,409
Cheers.

110
00:10:35,734 --> 00:10:36,567
Alright.

111
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,091
You bastards are gonna go on
like you do in the commercials,

112
00:10:40,157 --> 00:10:41,324
nice and easy.

113
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:12,194
Alright,
my girl's got my taste in wheels.

114
00:11:31,731 --> 00:11:32,889
Oh God,

115
00:11:34,414 --> 00:11:36,520
I thought the skirt was embarrassing.

116
00:11:51,707 --> 00:11:53,783
Alright, come on,
get your hot dogs, kids.

117
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:54,704
Good for ya.

118
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:55,836
Eat up!

119
00:11:55,902 --> 00:11:57,314
Get 'em while they're hot!

120
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,713
Give me two with everything.

121
00:11:59,372 --> 00:12:00,820
Miss Jo, is that you?

122
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:02,235
Course it is.

123
00:12:03,427 --> 00:12:05,919
Come on, snap to it, will ya?
My gut's chewin' itself in half.

124
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:07,964
Okay, it's just that
I've never been able...

125
00:12:08,031 --> 00:12:11,192
...to sell you anything
but organic sesame buns.

126
00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:15,173
New diet, fats, animal
protein, and carbs only.

127
00:12:16,356 --> 00:12:17,384
What about them?

128
00:12:18,122 --> 00:12:20,221
Now you know I give away freebies,

129
00:12:20,358 --> 00:12:21,903
thanks to good customers like you,

130
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,207
they don't have to eat
out of the trash can.

131
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:26,326
Keep the change.

132
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,310
Hi, Miss Forrest.

133
00:12:41,486 --> 00:12:42,402
Hey, Toots.

134
00:12:42,837 --> 00:12:43,670
Beef?

135
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:45,557
No thanks.

136
00:13:05,063 --> 00:13:08,184
Gee, Miss Forrest,
you forget where you work?

137
00:13:13,202 --> 00:13:14,564
Your desk is right...

138
00:13:15,404 --> 00:13:16,951
That's your name on it.

139
00:13:18,803 --> 00:13:19,636
Yeah.

140
00:13:21,834 --> 00:13:23,148
Jesus.

141
00:13:23,424 --> 00:13:24,992
What a squid.

142
00:13:50,979 --> 00:13:52,968
Mr Castle will see you, Josephine.

143
00:13:53,035 --> 00:13:53,869
What?

144
00:13:53,936 --> 00:13:57,120
Mr Castle decided to
give you five minutes.

145
00:13:57,187 --> 00:14:00,562
I suggest you don't waste it
with your usual outer space babble.

146
00:14:06,925 --> 00:14:08,564
What are you staring at?

147
00:14:08,631 --> 00:14:10,415
Somebody's been workin' out.

148
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,218
I mean, that outfit is very becoming.

149
00:14:13,284 --> 00:14:14,908
This is your last chance, Josephine.

150
00:14:14,974 --> 00:14:16,995
Save your flattery for the boss.

151
00:14:20,075 --> 00:14:21,911
That's a great suit, Mr Castle.

152
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:24,363
Have a seat, Miss Forrest.

153
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,061
I meant at the other end.

154
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:30,837
I like to look right into somebody's eyes
when I grill them.

155
00:14:33,003 --> 00:14:35,070
You requested this audience,

156
00:14:35,137 --> 00:14:36,680
but I'm gonna make it
easier on both of us.

157
00:14:36,746 --> 00:14:38,978
Now, I looked over your report,

158
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,623
and I even checked with NASA,

159
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,723
and there is no evidence
of a meteor shower...

160
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,348
...in the area you pinpointed.

161
00:14:44,414 --> 00:14:47,212
That plus the fact that this
has nothing to do with your job...

162
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,388
...means I don't want to be
bothered with this again.

163
00:14:50,455 --> 00:14:51,640
This meeting is over.

164
00:14:51,707 --> 00:14:53,822
Hold it, pal. I got some questions.

165
00:14:54,947 --> 00:14:56,911
What have I done
that's got you in such a sweat?

166
00:14:56,978 --> 00:14:58,167
Excuse me?

167
00:14:58,364 --> 00:15:00,710
Look, I've seen martian
molesters put up better fronts...

168
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:02,296
...than you're doin' right now.

169
00:15:03,204 --> 00:15:04,625
Have you lost your mind?

170
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,067
There's a video of this
thing crashing to the earth.

171
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:10,889
Why are you saying it didn't happen?

172
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:14,528
Well I'm sorry I didn't
make myself clearer.

173
00:15:15,017 --> 00:15:20,471
One, what you saw was a gaseous explosion
above the earth's atmosphere.

174
00:15:20,537 --> 00:15:21,474
And two,

175
00:15:22,572 --> 00:15:23,655
you're fired.

176
00:15:33,778 --> 00:15:35,160
I know what you are, buddy.

177
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:41,216
Oh, I lied about the outfit,

178
00:15:42,256 --> 00:15:44,285
but I still think you got a great ass.

179
00:16:04,961 --> 00:16:07,058
Smoking's illegal, Miss Forrest.

180
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,172
You know that.

181
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:09,155
Sorry.

182
00:16:10,318 --> 00:16:12,303
Forgot. Bad habits die hard.

183
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:21,945
Just remember,

184
00:16:22,012 --> 00:16:25,271
smoking was the leading cause
of cancer in women under 30.

185
00:16:32,022 --> 00:16:33,689
Gee, Miss Forrest,

186
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,736
office scuttlebutt is that
you're not gonna be with us anymore.

187
00:16:38,803 --> 00:16:41,085
'Cause I'm gonna rip your damn head off.

188
00:16:41,152 --> 00:16:42,319
Get over here!

189
00:17:06,557 --> 00:17:08,738
<i>You're gonna learn to mind
your own business, bitch!</i>

190
00:17:08,805 --> 00:17:11,504
You're gonna learn Jo Deth
doesn't take any trancer crap.

191
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:15,610
Who the hell is Jo Deth?

192
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,660
Tell me about Castle.

193
00:17:21,727 --> 00:17:23,615
What kinda trancer scam's he got goin' on?

194
00:17:23,682 --> 00:17:25,798
All I know is they want you dead.

195
00:17:25,865 --> 00:17:26,865
Who are you?

196
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:28,901
You first.

197
00:17:28,968 --> 00:17:31,275
Answer the question,
you might live 'til noon.

198
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:35,258
You can't scare someone
who doesn't care about dying.

199
00:17:56,161 --> 00:17:57,727
-Yeah?
-<i>Josephine, is that you?</i>

200
00:17:57,793 --> 00:17:59,663
-<i>I've been waiting for half an hour.</i>
-Where are you?

201
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,313
Have you lost your senses?
At the observatory, of course.

202
00:19:13,097 --> 00:19:14,565
Professor Malvern?

203
00:19:25,676 --> 00:19:28,539
Doc, you don't have any Old Harper
to take the curse off this stuff, do ya?

204
00:19:28,605 --> 00:19:29,896
Oh, I never touch spirits,

205
00:19:29,963 --> 00:19:31,125
but I might start.

206
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,081
Here are the sightings you made
and my verifications.

207
00:19:36,148 --> 00:19:37,336
Everything checks.

208
00:19:37,403 --> 00:19:41,822
The meteor definitely came to earth
approximately 340 miles due south.

209
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,768
But meteor showers do happen.

210
00:19:44,418 --> 00:19:45,811
Some penetrate the atmosphere?

211
00:19:45,878 --> 00:19:48,107
Well you know they do, all the time,

212
00:19:48,174 --> 00:19:52,371
but only one in every 200 thousand
ever reaches a populated area.

213
00:19:52,437 --> 00:19:54,825
So it's rare,
but why is everybody so pissed off?

214
00:19:54,891 --> 00:19:57,762
Well I don't know
what's upsetting people.

215
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:00,809
Maybe the aliens have finally landed.

216
00:20:00,876 --> 00:20:02,127
Wouldn't that be something?

217
00:20:02,194 --> 00:20:04,461
I've met 'em, Doc.
They're no great shakes.

218
00:20:04,527 --> 00:20:05,721
Smell bad, too.

219
00:20:07,445 --> 00:20:09,476
Listen, we're not the only
ones that saw this thing.

220
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:10,816
Well, certainly not,

221
00:20:10,882 --> 00:20:12,506
but we don't know what
happens to the information...

222
00:20:12,573 --> 00:20:14,702
...once we inform the authorities, do we?

223
00:20:14,858 --> 00:20:16,809
Thousands of people
could have reported it,

224
00:20:16,876 --> 00:20:18,806
no reason to single us out.

225
00:20:18,872 --> 00:20:20,676
Except me, I'm the one they want dead.

226
00:20:20,743 --> 00:20:21,971
Oh, Josephine.

227
00:20:22,038 --> 00:20:23,241
It's true, Doc.

228
00:20:30,326 --> 00:20:31,458
We're targets, Doc.

229
00:20:32,103 --> 00:20:33,219
What are we going to do?

230
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:34,627
Kick some ass.

231
00:20:43,877 --> 00:20:45,374
Stay here and take notes, Doc.

232
00:20:45,922 --> 00:20:46,958
What are you going to do?

233
00:20:47,344 --> 00:20:49,315
Show these punks
you don't screw with nerds.

234
00:21:17,504 --> 00:21:19,260
That bitch ain't goin' nowhere!

235
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:22,737
I ain't anybody's bitch.

236
00:21:32,979 --> 00:21:33,934
That was easy.

237
00:22:00,053 --> 00:22:01,662
Just give me a minute to pray.

238
00:22:01,729 --> 00:22:03,382
How about a second to die?

239
00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:04,547
That's all I'll need.

240
00:22:27,831 --> 00:22:28,965
Where the hell is she?

241
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:55,315
Won't be needing this anymore, asshole.

242
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:07,255
Yeah, I like it.

243
00:23:17,353 --> 00:23:18,797
I'm not sure about this, Josephine.

244
00:23:18,863 --> 00:23:20,708
People have been doing it
for a hell of a long time, Doc.

245
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:21,905
Just point and shoot.

246
00:23:23,464 --> 00:23:25,762
Those creeps would have killed you
if they had gotten inside.

247
00:23:25,828 --> 00:23:26,880
Next time somebody shows up,

248
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,716
I may not be here to save your ass.

249
00:23:29,488 --> 00:23:30,627
What about the body?

250
00:23:31,362 --> 00:23:32,900
There shouldn't be any bodies.

251
00:23:37,235 --> 00:23:38,947
Remember, next time
somebody you don't know...

252
00:23:39,014 --> 00:23:40,274
sticks their nose in the door,
blow it off.

253
00:23:40,341 --> 00:23:41,808
I'll be back as soon as I can.

254
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:56,451
I'll get you, you little runt,

255
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,390
if it's the last thing I do.

256
00:24:04,457 --> 00:24:06,300
Jesus, his pulse is falling.

257
00:24:07,451 --> 00:24:09,349
Below 50, temperature dropping.

258
00:24:34,385 --> 00:24:36,037
How are you still alive though, man?

259
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,044
Hey, I've been lookin' for you.

260
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:48,353
Boy, did you pick the wrong time.

261
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,713
No, you did, Jack.

262
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,169
Here, I know you burned the first one,

263
00:24:51,235 --> 00:24:52,077
so here's a replacement.

264
00:24:52,143 --> 00:24:53,668
Just don't waste it.

265
00:24:54,196 --> 00:24:55,495
How's the case coming?

266
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,468
I know the who,
but I haven't figured out the why.

267
00:24:58,647 --> 00:24:59,846
Every time I start asking questions,

268
00:24:59,913 --> 00:25:01,873
trancers pop up and start shootin'.

269
00:25:04,205 --> 00:25:06,389
I singed five today, new kill record.

270
00:25:06,456 --> 00:25:08,385
Congratulations,
but you better break the record...

271
00:25:08,452 --> 00:25:09,585
...for finding the killer,

272
00:25:09,652 --> 00:25:11,223
because you're starting to fade.

273
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,237
What the hell are you talking about?

274
00:25:13,529 --> 00:25:16,679
In the TCL lab, your existence
up the line is ceasing,

275
00:25:16,745 --> 00:25:18,238
which means in the very near future...

276
00:25:18,304 --> 00:25:20,298
I'm or my kid's gonna die.

277
00:25:20,364 --> 00:25:22,503
Unless you can stop it, fast.

278
00:25:33,623 --> 00:25:34,463
I gotta tail these kids,

279
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:36,905
and you gotta get the hell out of here
before you get busted.

280
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:40,509
God, I hate trancer hunters.

281
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:40,733
Remember me?

282
00:27:44,864 --> 00:27:48,105
Shouldn't you be dead
or at least in school?

283
00:27:48,353 --> 00:27:49,223
Move it.

284
00:27:50,384 --> 00:27:53,088
Hey, if you let me go,
I'll make it worth your while.

285
00:27:53,407 --> 00:27:55,615
Unless you've got an extra eye in there,

286
00:27:55,681 --> 00:27:56,856
I'm not interested.

287
00:27:56,922 --> 00:27:59,787
No really, I've got some great
stuff in my car to give ya.

288
00:27:59,853 --> 00:28:01,103
You can't give me anything...

289
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,726
...that compares with what
I'll get for catching you.

290
00:28:07,581 --> 00:28:10,276
Everybody gets a little blue friend.

291
00:28:10,485 --> 00:28:11,318
Move it!

292
00:28:13,877 --> 00:28:16,886
Just swallow and enjoy the nice ride.

293
00:28:17,899 --> 00:28:20,844
Why Miss Jo, good to see you.

294
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:23,722
Yeah, it'll be good to see you
on a slab.

295
00:28:32,056 --> 00:28:33,613
You were supposed to kill her.

296
00:28:33,807 --> 00:28:36,189
Yeah, this is even better.

297
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,061
You better hope Miss Shauna thinks so,

298
00:28:38,128 --> 00:28:39,945
or she'll burn out that other eye.

299
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:53,379
Jesus Christ.

300
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,822
I don't know if he can hear you.

301
00:28:58,244 --> 00:29:00,417
You don't think much of
this place either, kid?

302
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:01,698
Kid?

303
00:29:02,573 --> 00:29:03,509
How old are you?

304
00:29:04,542 --> 00:29:05,723
Older than you think.

305
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,544
So where'd they pick you up?

306
00:29:09,822 --> 00:29:13,672
Sleeping in a doorway on
Argyle, like the rest of us.

307
00:29:18,434 --> 00:29:19,800
All these kids runaways?

308
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:23,671
Runaways 'cause mom and dad
tossed our asses out...

309
00:29:23,737 --> 00:29:26,161
...or dad couldn't keep
his slong away from his daughter.

310
00:29:26,685 --> 00:29:29,499
Rest of 'em are just your run
of the mill bums and winos.

311
00:29:29,566 --> 00:29:31,133
Everybody's got a real nice story.

312
00:29:31,641 --> 00:29:32,785
What about you?

313
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,513
I'm just a musician
who's old lady shot herself...

314
00:29:36,579 --> 00:29:38,228
...and the cops think I did it.

315
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:41,119
So, this place is just fine for me.

316
00:29:42,369 --> 00:29:45,542
By the way,
everything I just admitted is bullshit...

317
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:48,356
...in case anybody asks.

318
00:29:48,665 --> 00:29:49,832
Fair enough.

319
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:54,420
So how come you're not havin' a big time
starin' in to space like your friends.

320
00:29:55,704 --> 00:29:57,640
I spit my little blue friends out.

321
00:29:57,707 --> 00:30:00,493
Around here, it's a good idea
to keep your head on straight.

322
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:03,312
Guess it's pretty easy
to control a bunch of kids...

323
00:30:03,379 --> 00:30:05,338
...if they're zonked out of their minds.

324
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:08,165
You can get some in front of
the transformer without a fight.

325
00:30:08,232 --> 00:30:09,636
What the hell's a transformer?

326
00:30:10,481 --> 00:30:12,301
You haven't been indoctrinated yet.

327
00:30:14,722 --> 00:30:16,126
Oh, you're gonna love it.

328
00:30:22,772 --> 00:30:23,605
Hey!

329
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,906
You meet your family leader in two hours.

330
00:30:27,288 --> 00:30:28,442
Get some rest.

331
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:30,587
It'll be a long night.

332
00:30:36,457 --> 00:30:38,780
Hey, it can get pretty
cold in here at night...

333
00:30:38,846 --> 00:30:40,673
...in case you wanna
share some body warmth.

334
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:42,492
I'm not into guys.

335
00:30:45,393 --> 00:30:48,879
I mean, just stick to your guitar.

336
00:31:11,324 --> 00:31:13,541
Welcome to your new home, children.

337
00:31:16,054 --> 00:31:17,102
Holy shit,

338
00:31:17,545 --> 00:31:18,901
Miss Work Out herself.

339
00:31:19,437 --> 00:31:20,626
You know Miss West?

340
00:31:21,377 --> 00:31:22,711
She's the reason we're all here.

341
00:31:22,778 --> 00:31:27,326
I know that you have all had
a hard life on the streets,

342
00:31:28,349 --> 00:31:31,644
but the days of living in fear are over.

343
00:31:32,627 --> 00:31:33,903
From now on,

344
00:31:34,956 --> 00:31:38,801
others will live in fear of you.

345
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:44,734
And your new family
will protect you always.

346
00:31:46,768 --> 00:31:50,437
For I've been given a gift from the sky,

347
00:31:50,504 --> 00:31:52,309
and I choose to share it with you.

348
00:31:53,513 --> 00:31:55,327
When somebody hassles you,

349
00:31:55,886 --> 00:31:57,537
don't you wanna fight back?

350
00:31:57,604 --> 00:31:58,596
Yeah.

351
00:31:58,802 --> 00:32:00,491
When you're broke and you're cold...

352
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:03,820
...and nobody gives a damn
whether you live or you die,

353
00:32:04,483 --> 00:32:06,020
don't you wanna show some strength?

354
00:32:06,087 --> 00:32:07,206
Yeah!

355
00:32:07,273 --> 00:32:10,338
Prove to the world that you exist?

356
00:32:10,404 --> 00:32:12,669
That you do count.

357
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:13,577
Yeah!

358
00:32:13,643 --> 00:32:15,616
Yeah, then come to me,

359
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:18,116
and I'll give you all of that and more.

360
00:32:20,011 --> 00:32:25,309
Come and receive a gift from the stars.

361
00:32:40,478 --> 00:32:41,311
Done.

362
00:32:43,154 --> 00:32:43,987
Now.

363
00:32:52,317 --> 00:32:53,150
Done.

364
00:32:55,203 --> 00:32:57,399
Feel your strength, children.

365
00:33:00,532 --> 00:33:02,601
So this is how it all got started again.

366
00:33:03,493 --> 00:33:04,923
I'll be a son of a bitch.

367
00:33:05,652 --> 00:33:07,004
How what got started?

368
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,682
Trancing,

369
00:33:09,211 --> 00:33:11,628
something you don't know about
and don't wanna know about.

370
00:33:11,695 --> 00:33:12,528
What?

371
00:33:14,088 --> 00:33:15,672
All this bug eyed monster crap?

372
00:33:15,739 --> 00:33:19,130
Hey, three hots and a cot,
plus I get to see some wild shit.

373
00:33:22,905 --> 00:33:23,825
Bring him out.

374
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,715
Some of you know my history,

375
00:33:42,564 --> 00:33:45,744
heroin, armed robbery, prostitution.

376
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:50,702
A life on the streets at
the hands of men like this,

377
00:33:52,032 --> 00:33:54,705
but I found the strength
to break away from that life...

378
00:33:54,772 --> 00:33:57,318
...and rebuild myself and to help others.

379
00:33:58,429 --> 00:34:01,342
I was lost, just like you,

380
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:04,458
but I found a source of strength.

381
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:09,314
Are you gonna let men like that...

382
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,639
...throw you away like you are nothing?

383
00:34:12,626 --> 00:34:14,859
He thinks that you're garbage.

384
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:16,628
Did you know that?

385
00:34:17,487 --> 00:34:18,536
Garbage.

386
00:34:18,603 --> 00:34:20,799
Is that what you are?

387
00:34:47,945 --> 00:34:49,987
Don't be lost anymore.

388
00:34:50,551 --> 00:34:52,377
You're part of a family now.

389
00:34:52,444 --> 00:34:53,572
Yeah!

390
00:34:54,242 --> 00:34:55,771
That's all for tonight.

391
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:02,315
We have to get these
children back to the city,

392
00:35:02,382 --> 00:35:04,588
so they can show their strength and unity.

393
00:35:07,334 --> 00:35:08,606
Where are they taking them?

394
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,821
All over the city,

395
00:35:09,888 --> 00:35:12,063
wherever Miss Shauna thinks
they'll do the most good.

396
00:36:04,052 --> 00:36:06,855
Good job, now eat your fill.

397
00:36:14,328 --> 00:36:17,579
Hey, don't you know too many
of those ain't good for you?

398
00:36:41,345 --> 00:36:43,946
The police should be discovering
the bodies any time now.

399
00:36:44,451 --> 00:36:45,772
They were perfect.

400
00:36:46,401 --> 00:36:49,426
The taste of blood worked
them into such a frenzy,

401
00:36:49,492 --> 00:36:51,596
all we had to do was turn them loose.

402
00:36:53,148 --> 00:36:55,801
And the media should be
crawling all over the crime scene.

403
00:36:55,867 --> 00:36:58,261
Now the public's going
to be shaking in their beds.

404
00:36:58,327 --> 00:36:59,353
Shocking.

405
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:02,920
Imagine a man and woman killed
right in front of their own home.

406
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:04,924
A deputy mayor and his wife.

407
00:37:05,345 --> 00:37:07,212
If the rich aren't safe in
their gated communities,

408
00:37:07,278 --> 00:37:08,955
then who is?

409
00:37:09,238 --> 00:37:10,278
No one.

410
00:37:10,441 --> 00:37:11,963
Now we've aimed high this time,

411
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:14,045
but we have to start
finding replacements...

412
00:37:14,111 --> 00:37:16,495
...for the city and state
officials we've removed.

413
00:37:16,912 --> 00:37:19,274
Not some carbon copy
idiots taking their place,

414
00:37:19,341 --> 00:37:20,471
but our own people.

415
00:37:20,537 --> 00:37:21,916
Our own trancers.

416
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:38,963
Look, I know this is better
than livin' on the streets,

417
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,652
but you don't wanna be tranced.

418
00:37:40,857 --> 00:37:42,756
They're frying your brains.

419
00:37:42,956 --> 00:37:45,587
They're teaching us
to stand up for ourselves.

420
00:37:47,267 --> 00:37:48,857
By killing on command?

421
00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:53,792
That's the kind of scum bag
who's been victimizing us our whole lives.

422
00:37:53,859 --> 00:37:55,062
Tell me, honey,

423
00:37:55,129 --> 00:37:57,588
how many of those little blue
devils have you eaten today?

424
00:37:57,728 --> 00:37:59,131
Oh, you're losin' 'em.

425
00:37:59,198 --> 00:38:00,576
Why not let it go?

426
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:03,446
Because I know what kind of
crazy shit this will lead to.

427
00:38:03,513 --> 00:38:04,523
What?

428
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:05,793
Have you got a crystal ball?

429
00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:07,633
Yeah, I've seen the future,

430
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,281
and it sucks unless we do
something about it now.

431
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:12,877
Look, I know you're all
drugged or hypnotized.

432
00:38:13,121 --> 00:38:14,760
That sleazebag with the hot dog cart's...

433
00:38:14,827 --> 00:38:17,555
probably been feedin' you crap
for months to soften you up.

434
00:38:17,739 --> 00:38:19,060
Sam is our friend.

435
00:38:19,127 --> 00:38:20,191
Look, you gotta get it together.

436
00:38:20,258 --> 00:38:22,619
This place is goin' up in flames,

437
00:38:22,686 --> 00:38:26,483
and I don't wanna see innocent people
buy it for some trancing bitch.

438
00:38:26,715 --> 00:38:28,928
Now I can help you get
the hell out of here,

439
00:38:28,995 --> 00:38:30,263
but you gotta want it.

440
00:38:32,045 --> 00:38:33,869
You better give it up
before the guards come round...

441
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:35,383
...with the bedtime feeding.

442
00:38:41,487 --> 00:38:42,798
Where the hell are you goin'?

443
00:38:43,758 --> 00:38:44,841
Men's room.

444
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,364
Hey, it's me.

445
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:16,664
Yeah, I've got something to report.

446
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,403
Yeah, in the usual way.

447
00:40:15,166 --> 00:40:18,030
You did your job, now make your report.

448
00:40:24,717 --> 00:40:27,887
The girl was trying to get
the bunk house to escape with her...

449
00:40:27,954 --> 00:40:30,862
...'cause she said the whole place
was going up in flames.

450
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,735
Now what did she mean by that?

451
00:40:33,328 --> 00:40:34,520
I don't know.

452
00:40:34,973 --> 00:40:36,725
I don't know, Miss Shauna.

453
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:40,545
I kept her alive trusting you, Mark,

454
00:40:40,611 --> 00:40:43,047
to find out what she knew
so you can turn her.

455
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:46,497
But then I've always had a
little doubt about your worth.

456
00:40:47,666 --> 00:40:49,770
Maybe I should just treat
you like the other me...

457
00:40:49,837 --> 00:40:52,744
...and put you in the trancing
beam just to be sure.

458
00:40:54,236 --> 00:40:56,334
Then we can never be together again.

459
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,444
Well, you're very replaceable.

460
00:40:59,642 --> 00:41:02,869
You're lucky that I choose...

461
00:41:02,936 --> 00:41:05,097
...to tolerate you for now.

462
00:41:48,067 --> 00:41:48,942
You see?

463
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,948
They don't seem like they're
having such a bad time.

464
00:41:52,285 --> 00:41:54,303
Sure, they're all brain dead.

465
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:56,155
It's better than the alternative.

466
00:41:56,398 --> 00:41:58,210
When you gonna wise up, babe?

467
00:41:58,817 --> 00:42:01,788
Son, you really don't know
who you're dealing with.

468
00:42:01,854 --> 00:42:04,059
I'd back off big time if I were you.

469
00:42:14,509 --> 00:42:16,404
Surprised it took you so long to find it.

470
00:42:16,471 --> 00:42:18,028
It was right there in plain sight.

471
00:42:22,449 --> 00:42:24,367
Sorry to point out your shortcomings.

472
00:42:27,438 --> 00:42:28,946
She's getting away!

473
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:43,213
Hey, you looking for this?

474
00:42:45,411 --> 00:42:46,985
Get your ass out of the car.

475
00:42:53,694 --> 00:42:57,489
Miss Jo, what happened to the nice clothes
and the nice attitude?

476
00:42:57,556 --> 00:42:59,341
Lady I knew would never play with guns.

477
00:42:59,408 --> 00:43:01,792
Lady you knew is gone, asshole.

478
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:03,986
Pity, I liked her.

479
00:43:04,396 --> 00:43:05,863
I don't give a shit about you.

480
00:43:23,846 --> 00:43:25,157
Josephine,

481
00:43:25,224 --> 00:43:27,315
so you've changed your look.

482
00:43:27,382 --> 00:43:29,165
It's not very sophisticated though.

483
00:43:29,232 --> 00:43:31,225
I'll take that as a compliment, honey.

484
00:43:31,617 --> 00:43:33,049
How many of these kids have you killed?

485
00:43:33,116 --> 00:43:36,837
We are just helping a lost and
bitter generation find a purpose.

486
00:43:37,385 --> 00:43:40,141
That little demonstration of
yours last night was lovely.

487
00:43:40,208 --> 00:43:41,790
When do they start eating brains?

488
00:43:41,857 --> 00:43:45,729
Don't worry, you'll understand everything
in just a few seconds.

489
00:44:19,374 --> 00:44:21,834
You mousy little bitch.

490
00:44:22,374 --> 00:44:23,695
I don't know how you got here,

491
00:44:23,762 --> 00:44:25,967
but you are leaving on a mission,

492
00:44:26,034 --> 00:44:27,139
'cause there's someone that we need...

493
00:44:27,205 --> 00:44:29,221
...to help us fight the scum of the world,

494
00:44:29,287 --> 00:44:31,000
and you're gonna get him for us.

495
00:44:32,612 --> 00:44:33,886
Say you understand me.

496
00:44:33,952 --> 00:44:35,399
I understand you.

497
00:44:36,068 --> 00:44:37,846
I live to do your will.

498
00:44:39,098 --> 00:44:40,711
To flourish in your shadow,

499
00:44:40,777 --> 00:44:44,729
to grovel at your feet like
the unworthy cur that I am.

500
00:44:44,795 --> 00:44:46,279
To wallow in your filth.

501
00:44:46,345 --> 00:44:47,411
That's enough!

502
00:44:47,478 --> 00:44:49,205
No, nothing's enough.

503
00:44:49,272 --> 00:44:53,240
God above all others,
master of all masters.

504
00:44:53,307 --> 00:44:55,370
Get her and two others
ready for transport.

505
00:45:02,837 --> 00:45:07,108
What task has the glorious Miss Shauna
set us to this fine day,

506
00:45:07,175 --> 00:45:10,348
we who are so unworthy
we could never hope to...

507
00:45:10,415 --> 00:45:11,893
Will you shut up with that crap?

508
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,733
There's the objective right over there.

509
00:45:52,371 --> 00:45:53,246
Get out!

510
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:55,336
I'm not afraid to use force.

511
00:45:55,779 --> 00:45:57,446
Good God, Josephine.

512
00:45:58,724 --> 00:46:00,030
What have they done to you?

513
00:46:00,457 --> 00:46:05,513
I have willingly been made a lowly drone
to the splendid Miss Shauna.

514
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,671
Man, you got her started again?

515
00:46:35,327 --> 00:46:36,971
Good lord, Josephine,

516
00:46:37,658 --> 00:46:39,355
I thought you were with them.

517
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:40,881
The important thing is they bought it.

518
00:46:40,948 --> 00:46:42,697
Now we gotta get you the hell out of here.

519
00:46:57,001 --> 00:46:59,116
One more step and
I'll blow his head off.

520
00:46:59,773 --> 00:47:01,470
Drop the gun, now!

521
00:47:19,699 --> 00:47:20,544
Come on, Jack.

522
00:47:20,611 --> 00:47:23,083
Kill this bastard so I can
bring you back up the line!

523
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:39,425
So how's the revolution goin', babe?

524
00:47:54,715 --> 00:47:56,788
Josephine, what is all this?

525
00:47:57,762 --> 00:47:59,287
Why is this happening?

526
00:48:00,278 --> 00:48:02,424
'Cause this bunch of
assholes wants power.

527
00:48:02,491 --> 00:48:04,027
They think you can help them get it.

528
00:48:04,094 --> 00:48:05,068
They're wrong.

529
00:48:05,134 --> 00:48:06,202
I know.

530
00:48:06,268 --> 00:48:07,702
That's our ace in the hole.

531
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:11,862
He didn't put up a fight at all.

532
00:48:11,929 --> 00:48:14,396
It's your ex-employee
who's causing all the problems.

533
00:48:14,463 --> 00:48:17,360
Now she's gone to enormous
lengths to protect Malvern.

534
00:48:17,426 --> 00:48:18,596
You might be able to use that.

535
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:20,164
I know how to handle this.

536
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,109
No, you'll leave a pile of corpses,

537
00:48:22,175 --> 00:48:23,773
and we won't be any closer to our goal.

538
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:26,014
If Miss Forrest and
Malvern have a friendship,

539
00:48:26,081 --> 00:48:27,111
use it against them.

540
00:48:27,177 --> 00:48:28,345
Once Malvern is compliant,

541
00:48:28,411 --> 00:48:30,027
you can gut the girl for all I care,

542
00:48:30,093 --> 00:48:32,305
but if you kill her now, she's of no use.

543
00:48:32,371 --> 00:48:33,783
<i>Those are my orders, Shauna.</i>

544
00:48:33,849 --> 00:48:34,682
Yes sir.

545
00:48:40,786 --> 00:48:42,306
Good evening, doctor.

546
00:48:43,011 --> 00:48:45,680
Hope this hasn't been too
much of a trial for you.

547
00:48:46,108 --> 00:48:47,867
Except for the zombies
and the mass murders,

548
00:48:47,933 --> 00:48:49,063
it's been peachy.

549
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:50,434
You're lucky you're still standing.

550
00:48:50,501 --> 00:48:52,952
I'd show a little bit more
respect if I were you.

551
00:48:53,018 --> 00:48:54,089
Yeah, Toots?

552
00:48:54,155 --> 00:48:55,528
Respect for what?

553
00:48:55,595 --> 00:48:58,385
The possibility of new world order,

554
00:48:58,452 --> 00:48:59,830
with your help, Doctor.

555
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:01,624
Josephine told me.

556
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:03,506
That's the meteor we tracked.

557
00:49:03,963 --> 00:49:05,048
Come take a look.

558
00:49:16,673 --> 00:49:17,601
What's it say?

559
00:49:18,356 --> 00:49:20,037
Less than 20 retins.

560
00:49:20,104 --> 00:49:22,636
Josephine, there's practically
no radiation at all.

561
00:49:22,703 --> 00:49:23,563
See?

562
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,032
No danger of contamination.

563
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:27,014
Bullshit.

564
00:49:27,383 --> 00:49:29,305
What about the ray that thing gives off?

565
00:49:29,372 --> 00:49:32,599
Doctor, even though it has no radiation,

566
00:49:32,666 --> 00:49:36,792
this meteor has special
qualities that we have distilled,

567
00:49:36,859 --> 00:49:40,276
an energy force that alters human tissue,

568
00:49:41,944 --> 00:49:43,394
particularly those of the brain.

569
00:49:43,926 --> 00:49:45,166
What are you talking about?

570
00:49:45,233 --> 00:49:48,615
By focusing the energy
using this device,

571
00:49:48,682 --> 00:49:52,739
we're able to concentrate
the ray on the frontal lobes...

572
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:58,285
...using the optical nerve
as a point of entry.

573
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:05,389
Good God.

574
00:50:08,891 --> 00:50:10,683
What have you done to this child?

575
00:50:10,749 --> 00:50:12,709
Oh, this is just a demonstration,

576
00:50:12,775 --> 00:50:13,998
but you see the result.

577
00:50:14,065 --> 00:50:17,966
With certain drugs, we've been able
to control the behavior of these subjects,

578
00:50:18,032 --> 00:50:21,546
evoke certain emotions,
and in this case, rage.

579
00:50:21,613 --> 00:50:25,053
Nothing like an army of killers
to make your megalomaniacal day complete.

580
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,409
That's why you're here.

581
00:50:27,744 --> 00:50:31,280
I can't have anything to do with
something so monstrous.

582
00:50:31,346 --> 00:50:33,929
These results are not our ultimate aim.

583
00:50:34,326 --> 00:50:37,513
This poor child's life
was over a long time ago.

584
00:50:37,935 --> 00:50:39,297
Don't feel sorry for her.

585
00:50:43,534 --> 00:50:44,367
God.

586
00:50:48,826 --> 00:50:52,388
Doctor, we don't want
you to be a part of this.

587
00:50:53,241 --> 00:50:55,109
We want you to help us modify the beam

588
00:50:55,176 --> 00:50:57,955
so that the results are not that extreme.

589
00:50:58,075 --> 00:51:01,014
Examine the meteor, test its elements.

590
00:51:01,081 --> 00:51:04,745
I know that you can find a
key to harness this force.

591
00:51:06,381 --> 00:51:09,131
We don't want an army of killers.

592
00:51:10,338 --> 00:51:11,778
What do you expect from me?

593
00:51:13,226 --> 00:51:14,655
Your best efforts,

594
00:51:15,361 --> 00:51:16,696
or you friend is dead.

595
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:19,714
Doc, don't listen to that shit,
and don't worry about me.

596
00:51:19,781 --> 00:51:21,772
I'm gonna kill all their trancing asses.

597
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:27,211
She's helpless.

598
00:51:27,863 --> 00:51:30,436
If you want her to live, then get to work.

599
00:51:31,971 --> 00:51:33,299
Come on, I want to show you something.

600
00:51:34,552 --> 00:51:35,385
Come on!

601
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:38,766
You can't do anything for her now.

602
00:51:41,787 --> 00:51:43,370
We've been gathering these meteors...

603
00:51:43,437 --> 00:51:45,841
...since the first shower
started two years ago.

604
00:51:46,386 --> 00:51:47,384
I remember.

605
00:51:47,944 --> 00:51:50,044
I tracked it, I reported it.

606
00:51:50,237 --> 00:51:51,665
Only to us, Doctor.

607
00:51:52,268 --> 00:51:54,632
We've intercepted all
your reports since then.

608
00:51:55,493 --> 00:51:57,823
They led up to the very
first tiny pieces of energy...

609
00:51:57,890 --> 00:51:59,312
...scattered around the desert.

610
00:52:00,011 --> 00:52:03,006
We saw the potential for something
very important in that rock...

611
00:52:03,073 --> 00:52:04,678
...and started experiments.

612
00:52:04,745 --> 00:52:06,173
The results are in here.

613
00:52:13,914 --> 00:52:18,359
We've had other scientists work with us
on perfecting the trancing beam.

614
00:52:19,085 --> 00:52:21,629
The results, as you can see, have been,

615
00:52:22,157 --> 00:52:24,305
well, unfortunate.

616
00:52:27,591 --> 00:52:29,808
So all this human
misery's worth it, isn't it?

617
00:52:29,875 --> 00:52:32,451
Don't suddenly grow balls, Doctor.

618
00:52:32,518 --> 00:52:33,912
They don't fit you.

619
00:52:34,185 --> 00:52:35,551
Just do as your told,

620
00:52:35,618 --> 00:52:37,393
and you and the girl can walk out of here.

621
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:39,119
Don't try my patience.

622
00:52:39,186 --> 00:52:40,916
If you haven't noticed, I don't have any.

623
00:52:59,589 --> 00:53:01,166
Jennings, if you can hear me,

624
00:53:01,232 --> 00:53:02,628
don't worry.

625
00:53:02,694 --> 00:53:05,692
My daughter ain't dyin'
like this, and neither am I.

626
00:53:13,583 --> 00:53:15,051
You got a problem, babe?

627
00:53:15,464 --> 00:53:17,294
Just talkin' to a friend up the line.

628
00:53:17,975 --> 00:53:20,328
I was tellin' him how sweet
it's gonna be to kill you.

629
00:53:22,383 --> 00:53:23,618
Don't think so, babe.

630
00:53:24,548 --> 00:53:27,490
See, I've looked into my future,
 and it's clear sailing.

631
00:53:28,202 --> 00:53:29,637
I've got somebody on the inside.

632
00:53:29,917 --> 00:53:30,941
No shit.

633
00:53:32,003 --> 00:53:34,647
Just don't count on them
to protect you from me.

634
00:53:34,713 --> 00:53:36,029
I'm shakin', babe.

635
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:38,259
I'm the one on the inside.

636
00:54:56,674 --> 00:54:58,978
I never seen one do that before, Doc.

637
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:01,710
You need to try that again.

638
00:55:02,463 --> 00:55:04,300
Don't worry, we'll get this up.

639
00:55:12,752 --> 00:55:13,803
Put me down.

640
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:21,849
You know how this works,
Doctor, don't you?

641
00:55:24,804 --> 00:55:28,331
Complete the circuit,
and you get a real nice effect.

642
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:32,507
Stop it!

643
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:35,682
Are you out of your mind?

644
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:38,233
Failure won't be tolerated, Doctor!

645
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:42,366
I gave you a job to do,
and I expect you to do it.

646
00:55:42,785 --> 00:55:45,571
One more test that doesn't work,

647
00:55:45,638 --> 00:55:47,086
and Miss Forrest...

648
00:55:47,153 --> 00:55:50,156
The name's Jo Deth, bitch.

649
00:55:50,223 --> 00:55:51,505
Deth, fine.

650
00:55:51,572 --> 00:55:52,906
How appropriate,

651
00:55:52,973 --> 00:55:54,848
and it won't be a pretty one, either,

652
00:55:54,915 --> 00:55:56,931
unless your friend cooperates.

653
00:55:56,998 --> 00:55:58,915
I won't let you down.

654
00:56:03,517 --> 00:56:04,984
Put her in the last cell.

655
00:56:09,527 --> 00:56:11,143
Enjoy yourself.

656
00:56:19,715 --> 00:56:23,070
I've singed trancers that make you guys
look like choir boys.

657
00:56:23,137 --> 00:56:24,420
You're nothin'.

658
00:56:28,697 --> 00:56:29,884
Okay,

659
00:56:30,481 --> 00:56:32,545
guess we're all in the same shape here?

660
00:56:33,581 --> 00:56:34,947
It's alright, I'm a friend.

661
00:56:42,473 --> 00:56:43,985
How do the targets look to you?

662
00:56:44,477 --> 00:56:47,126
Oh they're doable provided
we can replace them quickly...

663
00:56:47,193 --> 00:56:48,383
...with our own people.

664
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:50,651
Oh that's being taken care of right now.

665
00:56:50,718 --> 00:56:53,815
Now, Malvern has given
you nothing but failures.

666
00:56:54,158 --> 00:56:57,562
Assassins are fine, but we need
intelligent subjects we can control.

667
00:56:57,628 --> 00:57:00,055
His background makes
him perfect for this,

668
00:57:00,122 --> 00:57:02,649
and let's just say
I gave him a little incentive.

669
00:57:03,351 --> 00:57:05,028
I know we want to put
one of our own in power...

670
00:57:05,095 --> 00:57:06,501
...as soon as possible.

671
00:57:07,446 --> 00:57:08,585
I have the candidate.

672
00:57:11,154 --> 00:57:15,081
We don't even have to trance this one
to get him to do what we want,

673
00:57:15,148 --> 00:57:20,339
but treatments would modify his behavior
and give us a chance to educate him.

674
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,353
I can see him running for office.

675
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:24,948
Oh, I could see him winning.

676
00:57:27,115 --> 00:57:28,913
Have your eyes on being the first lady?

677
00:57:29,549 --> 00:57:31,077
I'm not that ambitious, sir.

678
00:57:31,143 --> 00:57:32,833
I'll settle for assisting you.

679
00:57:33,851 --> 00:57:34,906
How comforting.

680
00:58:05,364 --> 00:58:07,391
Josephine, can you hear me?

681
00:58:07,458 --> 00:58:08,392
Yeah.

682
00:58:08,459 --> 00:58:09,459
Take this.

683
00:58:10,319 --> 00:58:13,139
Believe it or not, I found
a good use for this thing.

684
00:58:13,335 --> 00:58:15,411
With the proper filters,

685
00:58:15,478 --> 00:58:18,146
it will greatly reduce your healing time.

686
00:58:18,213 --> 00:58:21,864
Put the salve on your wounds
and dress them with a sterile gauze.

687
00:58:24,971 --> 00:58:26,128
Thanks, Doc.

688
00:58:26,395 --> 00:58:29,239
For once, I'm gonna rescue you.

689
00:58:45,674 --> 00:58:46,661
Thanks.

690
00:59:01,867 --> 00:59:03,907
I think I found something
to meet your requirements.

691
00:59:03,974 --> 00:59:04,978
How so?

692
00:59:05,067 --> 00:59:08,245
I broke down the base elements
of the meteor and found substances...

693
00:59:08,312 --> 00:59:11,233
...that will filter out certain
types of the energy it gives off.

694
00:59:11,299 --> 00:59:14,863
The dosage of the ray can be controlled
so you can simply break a man's will...

695
00:59:14,929 --> 00:59:18,942
...or turn him into a raving
animal, your choice.

696
00:59:19,113 --> 00:59:22,247
Since I need to have it
operate at its mildest level,

697
00:59:22,313 --> 00:59:24,879
I think Josephine would be
a perfect choice, don't you?

698
00:59:24,946 --> 00:59:26,849
I mean it can't hurt her much.

699
00:59:26,916 --> 00:59:28,690
That's not the deal we talked about.

700
00:59:28,757 --> 00:59:30,994
I don't remember
having that conversation.

701
00:59:32,098 --> 00:59:35,282
In fact, I don't think
that it ever took place.

702
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:45,897
You know your shit, Doc.

703
00:59:58,361 --> 01:00:00,025
Here, this'll help.

704
01:00:12,215 --> 01:00:13,960
With this gift from the stars,

705
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:16,351
I can give you strength and power.

706
01:00:17,499 --> 01:00:19,117
Sometimes we need a brute force...

707
01:00:19,184 --> 01:00:22,147
...to deal with the scum
who control our lives,

708
01:00:22,214 --> 01:00:24,420
and other times,
we need the power of mind.

709
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:28,760
Now we have a choice as to
which direction we will go...

710
01:00:28,827 --> 01:00:31,703
...in order for our voice
to be heard in this world,

711
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:33,388
and I ask you, children,

712
01:00:33,455 --> 01:00:35,111
do you want a voice?

713
01:00:35,178 --> 01:00:36,177
Yes.

714
01:00:36,244 --> 01:00:37,430
Yes.

715
01:00:37,711 --> 01:00:39,812
I ask it again,

716
01:00:39,878 --> 01:00:43,911
do you want a voice to
be heard in this world?

717
01:00:43,978 --> 01:00:46,626
Not the cries of some weak victims,

718
01:00:47,879 --> 01:00:49,794
but someone of strength,

719
01:00:50,964 --> 01:00:52,695
of body and mind.

720
01:00:53,242 --> 01:00:55,281
Someone with true power.

721
01:00:55,348 --> 01:00:56,830
Yes.

722
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,243
Yes, we want it.

723
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:02,213
Then you all have your
chance in the transformer,

724
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:06,280
and you'll have the honors of being first.

725
01:01:07,666 --> 01:01:09,962
Doctor Malvern, you may proceed.

726
01:01:20,193 --> 01:01:23,287
You prepare the meteor,
I'll administer the dosage,

727
01:01:26,123 --> 01:01:28,192
and this better work.

728
01:01:28,259 --> 01:01:29,545
It should work.

729
01:01:32,452 --> 01:01:33,285
Now!

730
01:05:46,289 --> 01:05:47,186
Hey.

731
01:07:17,583 --> 01:07:20,069
Welcome to your future, asshole.

732
01:08:17,653 --> 01:08:18,880
You traitor.

733
01:08:18,947 --> 01:08:21,237
Don't you know
she's offering us the world?

734
01:08:22,879 --> 01:08:24,882
I won't let you take that away.

735
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:44,077
You whimp ass bitch.

736
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:54,672
You would have been
proud of me, Josephine.

737
01:10:54,739 --> 01:10:56,210
I didn't lose my nerve.

738
01:10:56,513 --> 01:10:58,059
I came close,

739
01:10:58,126 --> 01:11:01,028
but I singed that whimp ass Sam.

740
01:11:01,095 --> 01:11:02,512
I'm always proud of you,

741
01:11:02,579 --> 01:11:04,549
and you did a hell of
a lot more than that, Doc.

742
01:11:04,616 --> 01:11:05,783
Saved my life.

743
01:12:04,065 --> 01:12:05,858
Why did you come here?

744
01:12:05,924 --> 01:12:07,998
To stop you from killing my daughter,

745
01:12:09,437 --> 01:12:12,141
me, and thousands just like me.

746
01:12:20,054 --> 01:12:21,546
Oh gees.

747
01:12:25,138 --> 01:12:26,138
Take this.

748
01:12:28,478 --> 01:12:30,264
Use what you need,

749
01:12:30,330 --> 01:12:33,019
and turn the rest over
to a research laboratory.

750
01:12:35,267 --> 01:12:37,608
It would be nice if they gave me credit...

751
01:12:37,674 --> 01:12:39,470
...in the scientific journals.

752
01:12:40,269 --> 01:12:41,500
Don't worry, Doc,

753
01:12:41,567 --> 01:12:43,143
you're gonna do all that yourself.

754
01:12:51,548 --> 01:12:54,199
How come when it's over
there's always one body too many?

755
01:13:52,749 --> 01:13:54,729
I didn't think your
kid could handle this,

756
01:13:54,796 --> 01:13:56,108
but I was wrong.

757
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:57,777
You make a great team.

758
01:13:58,199 --> 01:14:00,864
Jack, just give me the word
and I'll bring you back up the line.

759
01:14:28,664 --> 01:14:29,884
Did you know that being an asshole...

760
01:14:29,951 --> 01:14:32,726
...is the leading cause of
death in both men and women?

761
01:14:34,675 --> 01:14:36,447
Give me my smokes and hit the road.

762
01:15:20,076 --> 01:15:21,369
You know,

763
01:15:21,436 --> 01:15:25,044
I never thought of you as
anything but a repressed,

764
01:15:25,111 --> 01:15:28,556
stuck up, bookish little nothing.

765
01:15:29,956 --> 01:15:33,525
Never underestimate anybody
whose last name is really Deth.

766
01:15:33,592 --> 01:15:34,445
Oh, I know that now.

767
01:15:34,512 --> 01:15:36,764
Your name is very well
known to my associates.

768
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:38,811
The others behind trancing, you mean.

769
01:15:38,878 --> 01:15:39,711
Maybe.

770
01:15:42,359 --> 01:15:45,516
There are hundreds of us,
and we control thousands,

771
01:15:45,582 --> 01:15:49,617
so killing me actually gets you nothing.

772
01:15:49,684 --> 01:15:51,256
Wrong,

773
01:15:51,323 --> 01:15:53,116
it gets my rocks off.

774
01:16:16,468 --> 01:16:20,385
Goddamn aliens,
smell even worse when they die.

775
01:16:33,884 --> 01:16:35,267
You've had quite a night.

776
01:16:35,334 --> 01:16:37,813
Wanna make it complete
and come back up the line?

777
01:16:39,717 --> 01:16:42,489
Jennings, did you know
Castle was a stinkin' alien?

778
01:16:43,141 --> 01:16:45,529
We had no information about him on file.

779
01:16:45,595 --> 01:16:47,970
Since he was using
the meteor energy, though.

780
01:16:49,062 --> 01:16:50,262
Probably brought it with him.

781
01:16:53,187 --> 01:16:54,637
You saved your daughter.

782
01:16:54,703 --> 01:16:56,312
That was the mission, and you did it.

783
01:16:57,441 --> 01:16:59,037
No, this mission isn't over.

784
01:17:02,176 --> 01:17:04,198
Castle said there's
hundreds more like him,

785
01:17:04,264 --> 01:17:06,777
thousands more trancers,
aliens, whatever they are,

786
01:17:06,843 --> 01:17:07,733
I'm ready for action.

787
01:17:07,799 --> 01:17:09,324
You're goin' after all of them?

788
01:17:09,390 --> 01:17:10,940
That's the job description, Ace.

789
01:17:11,772 --> 01:17:13,535
Jack, you're a colossal pain in the ass,

790
01:17:13,602 --> 01:17:15,842
but you're one hell of a trancer hunter.

791
01:17:16,173 --> 01:17:17,834
You'll see me back up the line.

792
01:17:17,901 --> 01:17:18,829
When?

793
01:17:18,896 --> 01:17:21,700
When I know it's safe for my daughter
to have her own life back.

794
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:26,517
<i>I've always figured that
the only jobs worth doing...</i>

795
01:17:26,584 --> 01:17:28,428
<i>...are the ones worth dying for.</i>

796
01:17:28,495 --> 01:17:31,577
<i>That's not for everybody,
especially my kid.</i>

797
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:33,346
<i>Scumbags are lookin' for her now,</i>

798
01:17:33,412 --> 01:17:36,359
<i>so I've gotta stay right here
to strike at them first.</i>

799
01:17:36,426 --> 01:17:38,187
<i>My name's Jack,</i>

800
01:17:38,253 --> 01:17:39,972
<i>Jo Deth,</i>

801
01:17:40,039 --> 01:17:41,729
<i>and I'm a trancer hunter.</i>

802
01:17:41,795 --> 01:17:43,751
<i>As I look out on
the sea of faces around me,</i>

803
01:17:43,817 --> 01:17:45,642
<i>I wonder how many of
'em are regular folks...</i>

804
01:17:45,709 --> 01:17:48,124
<i>...and how many of 'em
are ready to trance out.</i>

805
01:17:48,190 --> 01:17:50,144
<i>My job is to find out.</i>

806
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:54,853
<i>Trancers, not really alive,
not dead enough,</i>

807
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,611
<i>until I'm through with 'em.</i>
