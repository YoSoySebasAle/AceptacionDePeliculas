2
00:02:25,763 --> 00:02:27,865
God.

3
00:04:19,576 --> 00:04:21,076
Shit!

4
00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:23,746
Who are you and why did you
bring me here?

5
00:04:23,748 --> 00:04:25,848
Fuck. Bring you here?
Lady,

6
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,249
I just woke up.

7
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:29,617
Look. Look.

8
00:04:29,619 --> 00:04:31,086
I was drugged.

9
00:04:31,088 --> 00:04:33,923
Some arsehole
stuck me last night.

10
00:04:33,925 --> 00:04:36,524
Come on. See, please.
Come on.

11
00:04:46,237 --> 00:04:48,037
Is that where you woke up?

12
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:49,572
Yeah. You?

13
00:04:50,074 --> 00:04:51,807
Next door.

14
00:04:51,809 --> 00:04:52,944
A bunch of rooms out there.

15
00:04:53,978 --> 00:04:55,146
Is it just us?

16
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:58,581
The first door I tried.

17
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:02,751
What's the last thing
you remember?

18
00:05:02,753 --> 00:05:04,221
Gorgeous brunette
at the end of the bar.

19
00:05:04,655 --> 00:05:06,221
- Ah.
- What?

20
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,858
Just because I'm Irish,
you think I'm a drunk?

21
00:05:09,592 --> 00:05:10,995
I was having
a fuckin' ginger ale.

22
00:05:13,097 --> 00:05:14,231
What about you?

23
00:05:15,933 --> 00:05:17,600
I, uh, don't exactly remember.

24
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:20,869
Don't remember?

25
00:05:20,871 --> 00:05:24,572
Well, forgive me
if that doesn't do it for me.

26
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,744
Because when it comes to
a syringe in my neck,

27
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,080
I tend to be specific.

28
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:33,017
Now you're my new best friend.

29
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,885
Oh, we're not friends.

30
00:05:38,322 --> 00:05:41,190
Come on, give us a chance, yeah?

31
00:05:41,192 --> 00:05:43,593
We'll be as thick as thieves
in no time.

32
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:52,001
I'm holding you responsible

33
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:54,205
for whoever's going
down with you. Hmm?

34
00:05:55,306 --> 00:05:56,674
Right then.

35
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,541
After you.

36
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,728
Stop.

37
00:06:20,364 --> 00:06:23,198
Relax. We're locked in here too.

38
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,900
I don't believe you.

39
00:06:24,902 --> 00:06:26,137
You got one of these?

40
00:06:28,739 --> 00:06:30,973
I said stop.

41
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:33,842
If you're trying to cut through,
it won't work.

42
00:06:33,844 --> 00:06:36,779
- No shit.
- That thing burns hotter than lava.

43
00:06:36,781 --> 00:06:38,147
You'll start melting the metal,

44
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:39,649
and you'll be burning
the whole place down.

45
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:41,584
How do you know?

46
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:44,353
My father's in the trade.

47
00:06:44,355 --> 00:06:46,021
What trade?

48
00:06:46,023 --> 00:06:47,590
Contracting.

49
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,267
Just coming over here.

50
00:07:00,271 --> 00:07:01,705
What's on the other side
of this door?

51
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:04,275
A way out I was hoping.

52
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:09,579
You.

53
00:07:10,748 --> 00:07:11,949
What's your name?

54
00:07:12,649 --> 00:07:14,316
Kate.

55
00:07:14,318 --> 00:07:16,120
I'm Rowan,
if anyone gives a shit.

56
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,801
We're here for a reason.

57
00:07:57,328 --> 00:07:58,662
What is that?

58
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:00,231
A reason.

59
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,232
They're plans to a vault

60
00:08:03,234 --> 00:08:05,300
inside the Matheson Museum.

61
00:08:05,302 --> 00:08:06,835
- The what?
- It's...

62
00:08:06,837 --> 00:08:08,337
It's in Cleveland.

63
00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:09,907
Are we supposed to go
to Cleveland?

64
00:08:12,843 --> 00:08:13,944
Wait...

65
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:16,979
are we in Cleveland?

66
00:08:16,981 --> 00:08:20,082
What in the name of Jesus
are we doing in Cleveland?

67
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:22,184
- Where were you last?
- New York.

68
00:08:22,186 --> 00:08:24,319
Arizona. You?

69
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:26,190
Toronto. Vacation.

70
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:42,504
Someone went to a lot of trouble
to bring us here.

71
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:45,274
So, whatever the score is,
it's gotta be worth it.

72
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:46,975
Score, huh?

73
00:08:46,977 --> 00:08:48,477
I don't know
what you're talking about.

74
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:50,381
I'm a law-abiding citizen.

75
00:08:50,881 --> 00:08:52,750
Contracting, right?

76
00:08:53,217 --> 00:08:54,351
That's the one.

77
00:08:59,223 --> 00:09:01,158
But if this were a score,

78
00:09:02,393 --> 00:09:04,795
- what would it be?
- I don't know.

79
00:09:27,384 --> 00:09:30,287
Great. Reality TV.

80
00:09:33,857 --> 00:09:36,193
Kiss my bollocks, big brother!

81
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:47,137
High explosive.

82
00:09:48,072 --> 00:09:50,339
Semtex, maybe.

83
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:52,874
Christ, it's enough
to take down the whole building.

84
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:55,344
Where the hell is it?

85
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:57,348
I guess we're supposed
to figure that out.

86
00:10:06,257 --> 00:10:08,959
Why the hell do you keep running
toward all the scary shit?

87
00:10:14,898 --> 00:10:17,065
- Who the hell is this guy?
- Hey.

88
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:18,202
Hey!

89
00:10:22,906 --> 00:10:24,241
You wanna tell us
what you're doing here?

90
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,144
Same thing you're doing
I'd imagine.

91
00:10:29,146 --> 00:10:30,814
Trying to get out of here alive.

92
00:10:35,619 --> 00:10:37,121
You tried to escape.

93
00:11:03,314 --> 00:11:06,481
Gerry, you're late.

94
00:11:06,483 --> 00:11:08,218
And I have a schedule to keep.

95
00:11:08,886 --> 00:11:10,821
You're cutting it awfully close.

96
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:13,322
You've had months.

97
00:11:13,324 --> 00:11:16,191
Have you ever known me
to let you down?

98
00:11:16,193 --> 00:11:18,962
This isn't exactly the plan
we signed up for.

99
00:11:20,631 --> 00:11:22,232
Why you here, Gerry?

100
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:25,668
Because they're worried.

101
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,002
Because it's tonight,

102
00:11:27,004 --> 00:11:30,207
and because I wanna make damn
sure our investment is safe.

103
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:32,843
Is it?

104
00:11:34,378 --> 00:11:35,612
Look for yourself.

105
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,460
You know, I've been
doing this a long time

106
00:11:50,494 --> 00:11:52,327
and if there's one thing
I've learned

107
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:55,432
it's that people
are who they are.

108
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:58,701
I look at this,
and I wonder

109
00:11:58,703 --> 00:12:02,705
what makes you think that they're
going to do what you want them to do?

110
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:04,508
Well, because they have
no choice.

111
00:12:06,176 --> 00:12:09,279
Because they are...
who they are.

112
00:12:12,082 --> 00:12:15,050
What's this?

113
00:12:15,052 --> 00:12:18,389
I'm not the one who's going to have
to pay if this doesn't work out.

114
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:23,193
Always nice to chat, Theo.

115
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:26,196
Lovely to see you too, Gerry.

116
00:12:48,753 --> 00:12:50,087
No, thank you.

117
00:13:00,998 --> 00:13:02,466
Anybody mind?

118
00:13:05,135 --> 00:13:07,770
I was out in the hallway,
I was looking for a way out,

119
00:13:07,772 --> 00:13:09,204
all hell broke loose.

120
00:13:09,206 --> 00:13:11,175
You didn't feel like
coming out to say hello?

121
00:13:12,443 --> 00:13:14,176
Oh...

122
00:13:14,178 --> 00:13:16,478
let's just say I'm a bit shy
by nature,

123
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,414
and I wanted to know
who I was dealing with first.

124
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,249
You satisfied?

125
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:23,053
Entirely.

126
00:13:24,021 --> 00:13:25,387
What's so funny?

127
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:27,991
Well, you have to admire
the humor of this situation.

128
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:32,527
I mean, four thieves
locked up

129
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:34,629
and we haven't even committed
a crime yet.

130
00:13:34,631 --> 00:13:36,364
Thieves? You know,

131
00:13:36,366 --> 00:13:39,267
I'll have you know
I'm a contractor.

132
00:13:39,269 --> 00:13:41,004
Of course, you are, my dear.

133
00:13:42,674 --> 00:13:44,039
Now, listen up, kids...

134
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:48,076
if you wanna know what's going
on, take a good look around you.

135
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,745
We're all players.

136
00:13:49,747 --> 00:13:52,447
- Experts in our field.
- Get to the point.

137
00:13:52,449 --> 00:13:54,351
You wanna
know the point, big guy?

138
00:13:55,352 --> 00:13:59,621
The point is, we're all
career criminals...

139
00:13:59,623 --> 00:14:01,525
and this is a four-man crew.

140
00:14:03,393 --> 00:14:06,497
The mechanic. Rough, brawny.

141
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:09,832
And you, dear lady,

142
00:14:09,834 --> 00:14:12,567
graceful, nimble.

143
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:14,603
You're the B&E specialist.

144
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:17,274
We called them cat burglars
back in my day.

145
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:20,244
And that leaves you.

146
00:14:21,211 --> 00:14:23,411
You slick-fingered devil.

147
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:25,547
The safe cracker.

148
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:28,316
What does that make you,
smart guy?

149
00:14:28,318 --> 00:14:30,387
I guess that makes me
the smart guy.

150
00:14:31,321 --> 00:14:32,822
So...

151
00:14:32,824 --> 00:14:35,557
anybody figure out what
we're supposed to steal yet?

152
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:37,494
You pricks did your homework.

153
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,134
Who are you?

154
00:14:45,402 --> 00:14:47,137
Well, I'll start with
the more infamous first.

155
00:14:48,338 --> 00:14:51,341
Boston Museum,
18th of March, 1990.

156
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,577
- Nah.
- Oh, yes.

157
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:58,215
The frames of the pictures
are still hanging on the wall.

158
00:15:00,117 --> 00:15:02,117
No way that was you.

159
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:03,753
Grayson Bishop.
And it most certainly was.

160
00:15:03,755 --> 00:15:06,521
In fact, I still have
one of the Van Goghs

161
00:15:06,523 --> 00:15:09,357
hidden in a basement
somewhere to prove it.

162
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:12,695
So, an old-school
master thief, huh?

163
00:15:12,697 --> 00:15:14,264
Maybe you're the one
behind this?

164
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:17,499
Teach yourself a few new tricks.

165
00:15:17,501 --> 00:15:21,303
I seriously doubt there
is anything you can teach me.

166
00:15:21,305 --> 00:15:24,809
Besides, do you think
I would try to blow myself up?

167
00:15:25,843 --> 00:15:27,544
This doesn't make any sense.

168
00:15:28,412 --> 00:15:29,513
Why us?

169
00:15:30,614 --> 00:15:33,148
Well, I'm the very best
at what I do

170
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,317
and I'm assuming you are
as well.

171
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:37,753
Otherwise I would be
completely insulted.

172
00:15:37,755 --> 00:15:39,755
It would be easier
to hire us, no?

173
00:15:39,757 --> 00:15:41,189
Maybe.

174
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:44,194
Or maybe it's someone who knows
that we would never work for them.

175
00:15:44,729 --> 00:15:46,461
Or better yet,

176
00:15:46,463 --> 00:15:48,731
maybe it's someone
that wanted us fucked over.

177
00:15:48,733 --> 00:15:50,167
Like who?

178
00:15:51,401 --> 00:15:53,435
Do you got any enemies, kid?

179
00:15:53,437 --> 00:15:55,871
Because believe me,
I have a long list.

180
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,742
Don't call me kid,
you old fogy.

181
00:15:58,843 --> 00:16:00,609
You make me glad I'm an orphan.

182
00:16:00,611 --> 00:16:02,179
And an angry one at that.

183
00:16:06,851 --> 00:16:08,552
So what are we gonna do?

184
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:15,258
We live or we die.

185
00:16:17,862 --> 00:16:20,328
Doesn't sound like
much of a choice to me.

186
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,132
Excellent conclusion, dear.

187
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,167
Harris.

188
00:16:58,602 --> 00:16:59,603
It's so good to see you.

189
00:17:05,242 --> 00:17:06,476
What's this?

190
00:17:09,513 --> 00:17:12,950
Our border guy, he's reliable,
right?

191
00:17:13,985 --> 00:17:15,617
He is.

192
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:17,787
We've used him before.
You paid top dollar.

193
00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:19,957
He was instructed to turn off the
cameras, was he not?

194
00:17:21,591 --> 00:17:22,794
Yes, sir.

195
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,561
By you?

196
00:17:29,701 --> 00:17:31,201
Yes, I told him.

197
00:17:58,696 --> 00:17:59,897
I'll fix it.

198
00:18:01,032 --> 00:18:03,433
There is no fixing it, Harris.

199
00:18:04,634 --> 00:18:07,437
I'll... I'll figure it out.
I'll talk...

200
00:18:07,972 --> 00:18:09,573
I'll talk to him.

201
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,044
You weigh...

202
00:18:15,046 --> 00:18:17,612
about 75 kilograms,
Is that right?

203
00:18:17,614 --> 00:18:18,750
Yeah.

204
00:18:20,785 --> 00:18:22,417
Shouldn't take too long.

205
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:25,386
And please,
just don't fight it.

206
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:26,824
It's easier that way.

207
00:18:29,392 --> 00:18:31,761
See, Harris, every piece

208
00:18:31,763 --> 00:18:33,963
has a purpose.

209
00:18:33,965 --> 00:18:36,564
And every move has a meaning.

210
00:18:36,566 --> 00:18:38,770
And if you can't follow
the rules...

211
00:18:40,403 --> 00:18:42,037
everyone loses.

212
00:18:58,022 --> 00:19:01,058
You're in charge now,
and be careful decontaminating.

213
00:19:13,938 --> 00:19:17,438
We have to gain access
though the main elevator.

214
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,509
<i>Then, we have to open a security
door with an electronic lock.</i>

215
00:19:21,511 --> 00:19:25,915
<i>Next, we navigate a tunnel
secured by motion sensors.</i>

216
00:19:25,917 --> 00:19:28,651
<i>Then, unbreakable
tempered glass.</i>

217
00:19:28,653 --> 00:19:30,886
<i>Once through,
it's the vault room</i>

218
00:19:30,888 --> 00:19:34,491
<i>which brings us to the custom
1970s Mosler.</i>

219
00:19:35,993 --> 00:19:37,993
Even if you could do all that,

220
00:19:37,995 --> 00:19:39,762
which you can't...

221
00:19:39,764 --> 00:19:41,664
What's your exit plan?

222
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:44,767
I was thinking I'd just walk
out the front door.

223
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:47,069
It's kinda the point of
not setting off any alarms.

224
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,040
That much security,
what's in the vault?

225
00:19:49,674 --> 00:19:51,106
Gold.

226
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:52,440
Bonds?

227
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:53,543
It's diamonds.

228
00:19:54,511 --> 00:19:56,113
- What?
- It's diamonds.

229
00:19:57,181 --> 00:19:58,983
And it all started right here.

230
00:20:00,151 --> 00:20:02,017
John D. Rockefeller.

231
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:03,953
Son of a con artist.

232
00:20:03,955 --> 00:20:05,957
Became one of
the wealthiest men in America.

233
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,824
So, he had diamonds...

234
00:20:08,826 --> 00:20:10,993
a lot of diamonds.

235
00:20:10,995 --> 00:20:14,529
Hidden assets
from the government I assume.

236
00:20:14,531 --> 00:20:16,665
Anyway, they're all stored
right here in the museum.

237
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:18,000
At least for now.

238
00:20:18,002 --> 00:20:21,536
I mean, they move 'em around
from time to time.

239
00:20:21,538 --> 00:20:23,772
It was last rumored
that they were in Italy.

240
00:20:23,774 --> 00:20:25,674
Florence to be exact.

241
00:20:25,676 --> 00:20:26,976
How do you know?

242
00:20:26,978 --> 00:20:28,844
It's about the Mosler.

243
00:20:28,846 --> 00:20:30,112
You see,
it's a bit of a legend

244
00:20:30,114 --> 00:20:32,081
in certain rarefied circles.

245
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:34,016
It's never been cracked yet...

246
00:20:34,018 --> 00:20:35,518
though it has been tried.

247
00:20:36,687 --> 00:20:38,888
Sounds like a bunch of bullshit.

248
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:41,690
Could be. But our captor
believes it's true.

249
00:20:41,692 --> 00:20:43,526
So then, what do they
want us to do?

250
00:20:44,128 --> 00:20:46,628
Draw them a map?

251
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,596
They've already got
the blueprints.

252
00:20:48,598 --> 00:20:50,533
- They want us to steal it.
- No.

253
00:20:51,202 --> 00:20:52,803
They want us to pretend to.

254
00:20:53,871 --> 00:20:56,741
How's that
for a slice of humble pie?

255
00:21:05,016 --> 00:21:06,749
It's right this way, guys.

256
00:21:06,751 --> 00:21:08,516
And why should I
trust you, pops?

257
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:10,585
Maybe you're walking us
to an early grave.

258
00:21:10,587 --> 00:21:12,553
This whole place is a grave.

259
00:21:12,555 --> 00:21:14,489
You shouldn't trust me.
I don't trust you.

260
00:21:14,491 --> 00:21:17,726
I mean,
after all, we are criminals.

261
00:21:17,728 --> 00:21:20,195
You're a real ray of
sunshine, you know that?

262
00:21:20,197 --> 00:21:23,598
And you're a shoe size
passing for an IQ, dear boy.

263
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,835
There it is.

264
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:27,604
Would you look at that.

265
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:31,876
<i>Just like in the blueprints.</i>

266
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:36,147
They built a replica of
the museum?

267
00:21:41,752 --> 00:21:44,253
They want us to
practice the heist.

268
00:21:44,255 --> 00:21:46,956
They're gonna watch our every
move, and when we're done...

269
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,657
Boom.

270
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:50,025
And then?

271
00:21:50,027 --> 00:21:51,929
and then, someone else
follows in our footsteps.

272
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,897
And we are all okay with this?

273
00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:56,667
Do you have any other options?

274
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,740
Shit.

275
00:22:04,742 --> 00:22:07,910
Well, I thought you were
the safe cracker.

276
00:22:07,912 --> 00:22:10,578
This isn't a safe. It's...

277
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,646
a computer.

278
00:22:11,648 --> 00:22:14,183
No, it's not. It's a puzzle.

279
00:22:14,185 --> 00:22:16,785
It's a Henderson digital lock.
It releases.

280
00:22:16,787 --> 00:22:20,189
The way it works, it has four
bolts from the door to the frame.

281
00:22:20,191 --> 00:22:22,623
- Then we can use a gun.
- That's unnecessary.

282
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:23,959
Oh, yeah, why is that?

283
00:22:23,961 --> 00:22:26,028
Because this particular lock

284
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,832
depends on a person. A person who
comes up with a four-digit pin.

285
00:22:29,834 --> 00:22:31,501
Yeah, well, that's like...

286
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:34,703
a million different
combinations.

287
00:22:34,705 --> 00:22:36,005
Permutations.

288
00:22:36,007 --> 00:22:39,942
And it's 9,999,
give or take a fraction or two.

289
00:22:39,944 --> 00:22:42,077
But you see, our advantage is

290
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:44,113
that Henderson keypads

291
00:22:44,115 --> 00:22:46,315
use silicone with
positive printing.

292
00:22:46,317 --> 00:22:47,916
What the hell does that mean?

293
00:22:47,918 --> 00:22:50,686
What that means is that
the surface clings

294
00:22:50,688 --> 00:22:51,989
to the oil
from our fingertips.

295
00:22:53,824 --> 00:22:55,893
Move over, kid.
You're blocking the view.

296
00:23:01,265 --> 00:23:02,666
All right.

297
00:23:06,037 --> 00:23:08,806
Ah, this should be easy.
Twenty-four permutations.

298
00:23:20,684 --> 00:23:21,752
Voila.

299
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,053
There it is.

300
00:23:24,055 --> 00:23:25,721
How did you know
the combo?

301
00:23:25,723 --> 00:23:27,356
I don't know the combo.

302
00:23:27,358 --> 00:23:29,892
I know people,
and I know my keypads.

303
00:23:29,894 --> 00:23:33,162
Yeah, but the keypad at the museum
is not gonna be the same code.

304
00:23:33,164 --> 00:23:35,230
This is just a replica.

305
00:23:35,232 --> 00:23:38,000
Well, then it's a good thing we'll
all be dead, and it won't be us

306
00:23:38,002 --> 00:23:39,737
actually the heist then,
isn't it?

307
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:23,848
I'm assuming the real security
system won't have an off switch.

308
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:29,887
That's where it is.

309
00:24:30,955 --> 00:24:32,756
That's where they hid the bomb.

310
00:24:47,138 --> 00:24:48,638
They found the replica.

311
00:24:49,974 --> 00:24:51,840
They're behind.

312
00:24:51,842 --> 00:24:53,108
What about Grayson?

313
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:55,177
Played out just like
you said it would.

314
00:24:55,179 --> 00:24:57,012
He got everyone on task,

315
00:24:57,014 --> 00:24:58,883
and he cracked
the security code quick.

316
00:25:00,284 --> 00:25:01,652
And now...

317
00:25:03,254 --> 00:25:04,288
it's showtime.

318
00:25:11,996 --> 00:25:14,096
I don't know why you
brought the whole tool shed.

319
00:25:14,098 --> 00:25:16,367
There's nothing in there
to protect from lightsabers.

320
00:25:21,805 --> 00:25:23,340
What's she on about?

321
00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:26,076
I can do this.

322
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:27,978
Do what?

323
00:25:34,051 --> 00:25:36,418
We need to redirect the laser.

324
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,387
Did you bring the mirror?

325
00:26:02,146 --> 00:26:03,447
And see?

326
00:26:04,448 --> 00:26:06,016
Now it's in front of me.

327
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:36,380
Your turn.

328
00:27:01,372 --> 00:27:02,873
Shouldn't we be
motivating the others?

329
00:27:04,475 --> 00:27:05,876
I was just...

330
00:27:06,944 --> 00:27:08,910
looking for a weak spot.

331
00:27:08,912 --> 00:27:10,447
It's hard work
leading a crew.

332
00:27:12,116 --> 00:27:13,484
I'm not leading anything.

333
00:27:15,286 --> 00:27:17,121
See, it's not just
about skills.

334
00:27:18,322 --> 00:27:20,057
It's about personalities.

335
00:27:21,258 --> 00:27:24,361
You know Mag,
she's strong and silent.

336
00:27:26,363 --> 00:27:28,096
Bruised...

337
00:27:28,098 --> 00:27:29,466
but very reliable.

338
00:27:30,334 --> 00:27:32,200
And Rowan,

339
00:27:32,202 --> 00:27:34,405
he's a joker
but he knows his shite.

340
00:27:36,473 --> 00:27:37,908
And me...

341
00:27:40,577 --> 00:27:42,313
I'm the wiseass wise man.

342
00:27:44,148 --> 00:27:45,449
What about you, Kate?

343
00:27:46,317 --> 00:27:48,417
What are you gonna
bring to the party

344
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:50,087
that's gonna take us
to the promised land?

345
00:27:51,622 --> 00:27:53,891
I'm not taking you anywhere.

346
00:27:54,425 --> 00:27:55,991
I don't know you.

347
00:27:55,993 --> 00:27:57,459
I know you.

348
00:27:57,461 --> 00:27:58,896
Should we cut the crap?

349
00:28:00,397 --> 00:28:01,598
Excuse me?

350
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,369
Your Bingham Paxton's
granddaughter.

351
00:28:06,036 --> 00:28:08,103
Corsica Cabal.

352
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:10,038
You don't know what
you're talking about.

353
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,442
Spoken like a career criminal.

354
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,410
There's no point
in us lying to each other.

355
00:28:15,412 --> 00:28:17,147
We're all in this together.

356
00:28:19,116 --> 00:28:20,949
You mind me asking,

357
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:23,385
how did he get pinched?

358
00:28:23,387 --> 00:28:25,989
Your grandfather was a brilliant
man, and I was an admirer.

359
00:28:30,494 --> 00:28:31,628
It was a job.

360
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,465
Italy.

361
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:39,036
I was trying to crack a vault
and I took too long.

362
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,272
Police were supposed to be
diverted, but...

363
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,110
I escaped with the rest
of the crew,

364
00:28:48,112 --> 00:28:49,279
my grandfather
took the fall.

365
00:28:51,415 --> 00:28:52,549
What kind of vault?

366
00:28:56,453 --> 00:28:58,622
What kind of vault, Kate?
It's important.

367
00:29:00,591 --> 00:29:02,493
- A Mosler.
- A Mosler.

368
00:29:06,263 --> 00:29:08,530
This was your grandfather's
final score.

369
00:29:10,601 --> 00:29:12,670
He died in prison,
didn't he?

370
00:29:14,071 --> 00:29:15,606
And it's all your fault.

371
00:29:22,045 --> 00:29:24,446
You think you have
the answers to everything.

372
00:29:24,448 --> 00:29:26,148
Listen to me,

373
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:29,451
we do not have to do
what they want us to do.

374
00:29:29,453 --> 00:29:31,119
You and I could figure
something out.

375
00:29:31,121 --> 00:29:32,322
We don't have
to play their game.

376
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,357
I don't have to play
your game either.

377
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:38,360
I don't think you understand
the variables here.

378
00:29:38,362 --> 00:29:40,128
We're pawns.

379
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,532
We're pawns in something
much bigger.

380
00:29:45,436 --> 00:29:46,437
Hey.

381
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:49,004
We're ready.

382
00:29:49,006 --> 00:29:50,407
Rowan's got an idea
for the glass.

383
00:30:01,753 --> 00:30:04,555
All right. Here's the news.

384
00:30:05,289 --> 00:30:08,658
Prorated 10-hour
tempered glass.

385
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:12,162
Steel can be cut,
stone can be broken...

386
00:30:13,096 --> 00:30:14,797
but this...

387
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,468
This some new age
super-human shit.

388
00:30:19,771 --> 00:30:22,404
It's the kind insurance
companies love to see.

389
00:30:22,406 --> 00:30:26,243
Now the vibration might be able to
undermine the strength of the glass.

390
00:30:47,464 --> 00:30:49,132
You said it would break.

391
00:30:50,768 --> 00:30:53,335
- There's not even a dent.
- No.

392
00:30:53,337 --> 00:30:55,439
What I said was,
we might be able to weaken it.

393
00:30:56,173 --> 00:30:57,274
We need a minute.

394
00:30:58,575 --> 00:31:00,175
Hell with this.

395
00:31:00,177 --> 00:31:01,311
I'll join you.

396
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:26,201
I thought you were supposed
to be some kind of an expert.

397
00:31:26,203 --> 00:31:27,870
Christ, will you back off?

398
00:31:27,872 --> 00:31:31,108
Are all girls in Arizona
this mean, or is it just you?

399
00:31:32,677 --> 00:31:34,543
I'm from Mexico.

400
00:31:34,545 --> 00:31:37,813
Oh, lemme guess,
Cancun, Acapulco?

401
00:31:37,815 --> 00:31:41,416
Hone your skills breaking into
rich tourist hotel rooms?

402
00:31:41,418 --> 00:31:44,486
- Sinaloa.
- Oh, cartel country.

403
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:46,323
No wonder you're so friendly.

404
00:31:47,124 --> 00:31:48,525
But I was raised

405
00:31:49,027 --> 00:31:51,094
in the Magical Crew.

406
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:53,665
So, all my friends

407
00:31:54,498 --> 00:31:55,800
are dead.

408
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:58,635
Fair enough.

409
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:02,606
This is not about me.

410
00:32:04,174 --> 00:32:05,576
This is about Kate.

411
00:32:07,277 --> 00:32:09,714
I overheard her
talking to Grayson.

412
00:32:11,816 --> 00:32:13,083
She's Cabal.

413
00:32:13,617 --> 00:32:15,851
You don't say.

414
00:32:15,853 --> 00:32:18,723
- Granddaughter of the great Bingham himself.
- Hmm.

415
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:22,392
- And I do not trust her.
- Well...

416
00:32:23,594 --> 00:32:25,830
trust is hard to come by
these days.

417
00:32:27,364 --> 00:32:30,231
I think that maybe
we should keep an eye on her.

418
00:32:30,233 --> 00:32:31,703
Well, I'm keeping
an eye on everyone.

419
00:32:35,572 --> 00:32:37,707
You're an idiot...

420
00:32:37,709 --> 00:32:39,509
if you are not scared of them.

421
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,779
You should be.

422
00:32:42,646 --> 00:32:44,212
They could be behind this,

423
00:32:44,214 --> 00:32:46,882
and we have the cub in our den.

424
00:32:46,884 --> 00:32:50,218
And what exactly do you
want me to do about it?

425
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,356
I wanna show them
that we are serious.

426
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:07,471
Come up with anything?

427
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:11,575
Pass me the, uh, splicer there.

428
00:33:18,783 --> 00:33:20,484
So, what did you
and Grayson talk about?

429
00:33:22,987 --> 00:33:25,555
A score... you know,
what else.

430
00:33:26,791 --> 00:33:28,791
Play poker?

431
00:33:28,793 --> 00:33:31,426
- No.
- Well, you should.

432
00:33:31,428 --> 00:33:34,396
- You're a great liar.
- What?

433
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:36,166
Quick!

434
00:33:45,342 --> 00:33:46,643
What the hell?

435
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,414
You're working with them.

436
00:33:50,982 --> 00:33:52,416
- Who?
- The Cabal.

437
00:33:53,918 --> 00:33:55,583
I don't know
what you're talking about.

438
00:33:55,585 --> 00:33:57,419
I overheard you
talking to Grayson.

439
00:33:57,421 --> 00:33:59,554
You're Cabal,
and they are behind this.

440
00:33:59,556 --> 00:34:01,356
Why would they do that?

441
00:34:01,358 --> 00:34:03,491
They are the only ones with
the resources for this, no?

442
00:34:03,493 --> 00:34:05,427
You're making a mistake.

443
00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:07,963
We need each other
if we're gonna get outta here.

444
00:34:07,965 --> 00:34:09,531
I think...

445
00:34:09,533 --> 00:34:12,269
that maybe you need us.

446
00:34:13,871 --> 00:34:17,272
And they need you
in one piece.

447
00:34:17,274 --> 00:34:19,742
And maybe, if they're
worried about you,

448
00:34:19,744 --> 00:34:21,609
they'll pop open the door.

449
00:34:21,611 --> 00:34:24,214
Only if they know that we are serious.

450
00:34:28,853 --> 00:34:30,686
What the hell is going on here?

451
00:34:30,688 --> 00:34:31,787
Nothing important.

452
00:34:31,789 --> 00:34:34,556
Just a small hiccup
in group trust.

453
00:34:34,558 --> 00:34:36,792
- Don't be absurd.
- What are you doing?

454
00:34:36,794 --> 00:34:38,661
Take it easy, old boy.

455
00:34:38,663 --> 00:34:40,796
- We need her.
- She's Cabal.

456
00:34:40,798 --> 00:34:42,397
So what?

457
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:43,835
She was Cabal.

458
00:34:44,301 --> 00:34:46,367
She's not anymore.

459
00:34:46,369 --> 00:34:47,635
Believe me
when I tell you this.

460
00:34:47,637 --> 00:34:49,739
She is not the one
responsible for all this.

461
00:34:49,741 --> 00:34:51,306
How do you know?

462
00:34:51,308 --> 00:34:53,641
She would never we caught dead
working for scum.

463
00:34:53,643 --> 00:34:55,980
The likes of Theodore Thurlo III.

464
00:34:57,414 --> 00:35:01,516
Who the hell is
Theodore Thurlo III?

465
00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:03,819
I mean, did we get kidnapped
by a knight of the Round Table?

466
00:35:05,422 --> 00:35:08,356
He's the man behind
this current predicament.

467
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:09,825
And believe me,

468
00:35:09,827 --> 00:35:12,262
indirectly he has
a deep connection to you.

469
00:35:12,797 --> 00:35:14,663
Bollocks, mate.

470
00:35:14,665 --> 00:35:16,498
You were born in Dublin,
weren't ya?

471
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,933
Yeah, I was.

472
00:35:17,935 --> 00:35:20,970
Theo had some crews there
back in the day.

473
00:35:20,972 --> 00:35:23,806
You see, the one thing
you have to know about our boy,

474
00:35:23,808 --> 00:35:25,941
he doesn't like
to leave witnesses.

475
00:35:25,943 --> 00:35:28,376
Even crew.

476
00:35:28,378 --> 00:35:30,746
I understand there were a lot
of bodies left behind in Dublin

477
00:35:30,748 --> 00:35:32,715
when he pulled out.

478
00:35:32,717 --> 00:35:34,584
You did say you were an orphan,
didn't you?

479
00:35:36,353 --> 00:35:38,386
And you, my dear...

480
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:40,890
you were part of
the Magical Crew.

481
00:35:40,892 --> 00:35:44,960
Well, of course,
you don't have crew anymore.

482
00:35:44,962 --> 00:35:48,130
They all went the way
of the bullet except you.

483
00:35:48,132 --> 00:35:51,000
That's a terrible shame,
now isn't it?

484
00:35:51,002 --> 00:35:55,403
A street kid like you
raised in the gutter.

485
00:35:55,405 --> 00:35:59,574
I understand that Theo used to recruit
all the urchins on the streets of Mexico.

486
00:35:59,576 --> 00:36:00,945
Only he didn't treat 'em
so good.

487
00:36:02,646 --> 00:36:04,445
You don't know what
you're talking about.

488
00:36:04,447 --> 00:36:05,413
Oh, I think I do.

489
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:08,518
In fact, I think Dickens
wrote a book about it.

490
00:36:10,121 --> 00:36:11,789
Scooped up...

491
00:36:13,925 --> 00:36:15,392
taught to steal...

492
00:36:16,027 --> 00:36:18,127
taught to kill...

493
00:36:18,129 --> 00:36:21,730
turned into something
that you absolutely despised.

494
00:36:21,732 --> 00:36:25,102
And then betrayed,
and left for dead.

495
00:36:28,906 --> 00:36:30,840
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

496
00:36:30,842 --> 00:36:31,807
It's okay.

497
00:36:31,809 --> 00:36:33,978
Well, that's a hell
of a punch you got there.

498
00:36:37,048 --> 00:36:39,114
How do you know Theo?

499
00:36:39,116 --> 00:36:41,016
What did he do to you?

500
00:36:41,018 --> 00:36:44,689
Well... it's more like
what I did to him.

501
00:36:46,691 --> 00:36:47,792
The paintings.

502
00:36:49,492 --> 00:36:52,695
Boston Museum,
you screwed him over.

503
00:36:52,697 --> 00:36:54,763
No, I did not screw him over.

504
00:36:54,765 --> 00:36:57,599
Let's just say I got the first
punch in and won the day.

505
00:36:57,601 --> 00:36:59,201
And now he's
taking his revenge.

506
00:36:59,203 --> 00:37:00,872
It's all bullshit.

507
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:03,471
You know that, right?

508
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:05,640
You don't know shit about us.

509
00:37:05,642 --> 00:37:08,746
Well, then, let's just say I came
up with a good cover story for you.

510
00:37:15,086 --> 00:37:16,919
You better listen up,

511
00:37:16,921 --> 00:37:20,555
and listen to me
real good, people.

512
00:37:20,557 --> 00:37:23,458
You're gonna have to be a lot
smarter about what you're doing

513
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,395
if you plan on
getting out of here alive.

514
00:37:37,708 --> 00:37:39,607
Time to start phase two.

515
00:39:01,959 --> 00:39:03,859
What are you doing?

516
00:39:03,861 --> 00:39:05,894
What we should
all be doing.

517
00:39:05,896 --> 00:39:07,930
Trying to find a way out.

518
00:39:07,932 --> 00:39:12,001
You're wasting your time.
You're wasting our time.

519
00:39:12,003 --> 00:39:14,238
What, you think they'd just leave
this open so you can climb up?

520
00:39:15,006 --> 00:39:16,138
What do you know?

521
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,639
I know that someone
has their finger on a trigger,

522
00:39:18,641 --> 00:39:19,944
not much else
I need to know.

523
00:39:32,189 --> 00:39:34,857
Look, you don't like me.

524
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:37,092
- Fine. I get it.
- No.

525
00:39:37,094 --> 00:39:38,927
No, you don't get it.

526
00:39:38,929 --> 00:39:40,064
You don't get a fucking thing.

527
00:39:41,198 --> 00:39:42,931
You're Cabal.

528
00:39:42,933 --> 00:39:45,100
With all your rituals
and your rules,

529
00:39:45,102 --> 00:39:46,804
and your lines of succession,
all of that shit...

530
00:39:48,172 --> 00:39:50,305
You're just a bunch
of spoiled,

531
00:39:50,307 --> 00:39:52,877
entitled, aristocrats
playing pirate.

532
00:39:57,048 --> 00:39:58,947
You don't know what
you're talking about.

533
00:39:58,949 --> 00:40:02,751
Everything that I know
I learned myself.

534
00:40:02,753 --> 00:40:04,887
I didn't have no private lessons

535
00:40:04,889 --> 00:40:06,323
in some European castle.

536
00:40:08,259 --> 00:40:10,995
You know, I fought
and I bled...

537
00:40:12,396 --> 00:40:14,763
and I'm gonna do the same thing
to get out of here.

538
00:40:14,765 --> 00:40:17,699
This won't end the way
you think it will.

539
00:40:17,701 --> 00:40:19,268
Not if we don't work together.

540
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:21,403
- Ladies?
- What?

541
00:40:21,405 --> 00:40:23,005
What did you do?

542
00:40:23,007 --> 00:40:24,173
Nothing.

543
00:40:24,175 --> 00:40:26,341
Bullshit you did nothing!

544
00:40:26,343 --> 00:40:28,846
Because I know I did nothing
and youse two are...

545
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,847
Wait. What are youse doing?

546
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:33,982
Not running around
like rats in a maze.

547
00:40:33,984 --> 00:40:37,086
Oh, Jesus.
You sound like Grayson.

548
00:40:37,088 --> 00:40:39,088
Can one of youse explain to me

549
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:41,990
- why we only have two hours left, huh?
- What?

550
00:40:41,992 --> 00:40:44,126
That's not right.
We should have a little under three.

551
00:40:44,128 --> 00:40:48,197
Well, you must have
pissed somebody off then.

552
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:50,432
- Now, can we get back to work please?
- Why?

553
00:40:50,434 --> 00:40:52,903
- This whole thing is obviously rigged.
- Maybe...

554
00:40:54,338 --> 00:40:56,974
but Rowan's right,
and we need your help.

555
00:40:57,908 --> 00:40:59,842
There is no "we" here, okay?

556
00:40:59,844 --> 00:41:01,045
There is today.

557
00:41:03,914 --> 00:41:04,949
What the hell was that?

558
00:41:06,417 --> 00:41:08,217
I smell smoke.

559
00:41:08,219 --> 00:41:10,152
Where's Grayson?

560
00:41:10,154 --> 00:41:12,256
Having a sniff
the last time we checked.

561
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,909
- What the hell?
- It's the blueprints.

562
00:41:32,476 --> 00:41:33,775
What's he playing at?

563
00:41:33,777 --> 00:41:35,379
Forgive the chicanery,
my friends.

564
00:41:42,419 --> 00:41:44,155
- Damn it!
- Prick!

565
00:41:44,889 --> 00:41:46,855
Fuck that bastard.

566
00:41:46,857 --> 00:41:48,457
Do you know how to fix this?

567
00:41:48,459 --> 00:41:49,760
Uh,
gimme a minute, will ya?

568
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,830
You always did have
a big laugh at me,

569
00:41:54,832 --> 00:41:56,398
didn't you, big guy?

570
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,000
Well, it's nice to know

571
00:41:58,002 --> 00:42:00,838
that today is gonna be
more of the same.

572
00:42:08,012 --> 00:42:10,281
I know you can hear me,
you treacherous prick.

573
00:42:11,315 --> 00:42:13,982
So, grab a handful,
asshole,

574
00:42:13,984 --> 00:42:16,353
and pucker those lips
and start smooching.

575
00:42:19,757 --> 00:42:21,123
He's probably looking for a way out.

576
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:22,359
We are too, you prick.

577
00:42:23,294 --> 00:42:26,495
16,000 degrees of separation,

578
00:42:26,497 --> 00:42:29,233
and I spit my last breath
in your face.

579
00:42:34,205 --> 00:42:35,372
He's gonna burn
the whole place down.

580
00:42:37,208 --> 00:42:38,774
Shit.

581
00:42:38,776 --> 00:42:39,910
He might actually get though.

582
00:42:40,544 --> 00:42:42,811
- Arm it.
- You sure?

583
00:42:42,813 --> 00:42:44,181
Arm it!

584
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:54,725
Shit.

585
00:42:55,993 --> 00:42:58,060
- Hurry!
- Shut up, will ya.

586
00:42:58,062 --> 00:42:59,494
Why couldn't it be
his own bollocks?

587
00:42:59,496 --> 00:43:01,198
He's gonna get us all killed.

588
00:43:01,966 --> 00:43:03,000
Now!

589
00:43:12,509 --> 00:43:13,877
You sure?

590
00:43:16,046 --> 00:43:17,281
Wait.

591
00:43:20,985 --> 00:43:22,253
I'll do it.

592
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:49,278
Son of a bitch.

593
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,179
Hey. Hey.

594
00:43:51,181 --> 00:43:52,950
- What took you so long?
- Shh.

595
00:43:54,051 --> 00:43:55,917
What the hell were you thinking?

596
00:43:55,919 --> 00:43:58,186
Oh, just thought that

597
00:43:58,188 --> 00:43:59,888
I'd give you guys
a head start.

598
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:02,357
You wanted to see,
so to speak.

599
00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:05,494
I'm afraid it's up to you to
take 'em to the promised land.

600
00:44:05,496 --> 00:44:08,365
Shh. Just... Just stay still.

601
00:44:11,368 --> 00:44:12,836
See it through.

602
00:44:36,661 --> 00:44:38,062
Go back. I wanna know
what he told her.

603
00:44:48,138 --> 00:44:50,007
- Can't make it out.
- Well, try harder.

604
00:44:52,009 --> 00:44:54,511
- I can't.
- Kei, try harder!

605
00:44:55,546 --> 00:44:57,314
Grayson never was
a team player.

606
00:44:59,216 --> 00:45:02,484
- I just meant he...
- The man was an artist.

607
00:45:02,486 --> 00:45:05,287
He pulled off the greatest
art heist in history.

608
00:45:05,289 --> 00:45:07,224
Show some goddamn respect.

609
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:24,206
Gerry.

610
00:45:24,208 --> 00:45:27,609
Please don't try to tell me
that this was part of the plan.

611
00:45:27,611 --> 00:45:29,712
It wasn't entirely unexpected.

612
00:45:29,714 --> 00:45:31,446
I have no idea what that means.

613
00:45:31,448 --> 00:45:34,316
What it means, Gerry,
is that he fulfilled his role.

614
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:36,585
And sometimes you have
to trade a pawn

615
00:45:36,587 --> 00:45:38,688
to put your pieces
in the right position.

616
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:41,356
Just remember who
you're playing with.

617
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:43,358
No more sacrifices.

618
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,095
Get me those diamonds.

619
00:45:57,141 --> 00:46:00,609
Grayson went at it alone
and look wat happened to him.

620
00:46:00,611 --> 00:46:03,247
I'm not... We're not
gonna make the same mistake.

621
00:46:04,314 --> 00:46:06,651
If we're gonna win this,
we need to get through it.

622
00:46:08,285 --> 00:46:09,453
You have a choice to make.

623
00:46:10,421 --> 00:46:12,755
I've made mine.

624
00:46:12,757 --> 00:46:15,526
We either die in here,
or we get out together.

625
00:46:25,737 --> 00:46:26,970
Try it again.

626
00:46:40,551 --> 00:46:42,184
Anything we can use?

627
00:46:42,186 --> 00:46:45,153
It's shite, garbage and junk.

628
00:46:45,155 --> 00:46:46,223
Come on, there's
gotta be something.

629
00:46:47,157 --> 00:46:48,392
Cut it sharper.

630
00:46:51,663 --> 00:46:53,063
Again.

631
00:46:54,465 --> 00:46:56,264
Okay, try again.

632
00:46:56,266 --> 00:46:58,066
All right.

633
00:46:58,068 --> 00:47:00,368
- Bring me the drone.
- Why?

634
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:02,304
The camera's got a memory card.

635
00:47:02,306 --> 00:47:03,440
Again. Higher.

636
00:47:04,074 --> 00:47:05,207
Try again.

637
00:47:05,209 --> 00:47:07,077
We're not gonna have
time to make these adjustments.

638
00:47:29,299 --> 00:47:30,534
Well done.

639
00:47:41,345 --> 00:47:44,112
- Why'd you do it?
- Do what?

640
00:47:44,114 --> 00:47:45,616
Rob those banks.

641
00:47:47,618 --> 00:47:49,419
Was it for yourself,
or for someone else?

642
00:47:50,688 --> 00:47:52,587
Let's just say
the Irish system

643
00:47:52,589 --> 00:47:55,025
for young lads without
a family isn't all that great.

644
00:47:57,729 --> 00:48:00,128
I'm sorry.

645
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:03,231
Pretty soon, you'll find your family on
the inside is worth a hell of a lot more

646
00:48:03,233 --> 00:48:06,370
than whatever fucked up situation
you have on the outside.

647
00:48:11,608 --> 00:48:12,777
Right...

648
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:14,609
got it.

649
00:48:14,611 --> 00:48:17,047
A1 Charlie Swan.

650
00:48:21,418 --> 00:48:22,486
Steel.

651
00:48:24,221 --> 00:48:25,821
Steel.

652
00:48:25,823 --> 00:48:27,690
Tungsten carbide.

653
00:48:27,692 --> 00:48:29,493
Cobalt... bollocks.

654
00:48:30,728 --> 00:48:32,095
Nothing?

655
00:48:34,666 --> 00:48:37,232
It's got an extremely high
surface compression

656
00:48:37,234 --> 00:48:38,834
stress resistance.

657
00:48:38,836 --> 00:48:41,771
- At least a nine on the Mohs scale.
- What's that?

658
00:48:41,773 --> 00:48:43,505
Means it's hard as hell.

659
00:48:43,507 --> 00:48:44,742
Can anything cut though it?

660
00:48:45,475 --> 00:48:46,676
Diamonds.

661
00:48:46,678 --> 00:48:49,144
But unless you got yourself
engaged lately

662
00:48:49,146 --> 00:48:50,813
you're on the wrong end
of the vault for that.

663
00:48:50,815 --> 00:48:52,614
Well, anything else?

664
00:48:52,616 --> 00:48:54,652
Corundum, ceramic...

665
00:49:00,457 --> 00:49:01,625
Where are you going?

666
00:49:02,927 --> 00:49:04,494
Playin' wagon.

667
00:49:20,912 --> 00:49:22,279
What about this?

668
00:49:23,313 --> 00:49:24,747
What am I looking at here?

669
00:49:24,749 --> 00:49:27,415
Spark plug. Ceramic tip.

670
00:49:27,417 --> 00:49:28,786
- How did you know that?
- My grandfather.

671
00:49:29,419 --> 00:49:30,621
Excuse me.

672
00:49:34,424 --> 00:49:35,891
You have something to
hold this with?

673
00:49:35,893 --> 00:49:38,128
Yeah... here.

674
00:49:39,262 --> 00:49:40,796
Here we go.

675
00:49:40,798 --> 00:49:42,199
Okay.

676
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:54,478
Wait.

677
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:00,384
See? A dent.

678
00:50:02,219 --> 00:50:03,387
Smart.

679
00:50:05,823 --> 00:50:08,291
Very good start.

680
00:50:14,699 --> 00:50:16,333
Ceramic tip.

681
00:50:17,334 --> 00:50:18,633
Thank you.

682
00:50:18,635 --> 00:50:19,937
Excuse me, ladies.

683
00:50:34,317 --> 00:50:35,753
Would you look at that.

684
00:50:40,524 --> 00:50:41,591
Come on.

685
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:13,791
Now, let's see
what you can do.

686
00:51:29,941 --> 00:51:31,408
You sure she can do it?

687
00:51:32,043 --> 00:51:33,276
I'm sure.

688
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:35,913
How you know?

689
00:51:37,581 --> 00:51:39,616
Because she hates me
too much to fail.

690
00:51:40,584 --> 00:51:41,953
They all do.

691
00:51:46,323 --> 00:51:47,992
How much time do you need?

692
00:51:48,926 --> 00:51:50,627
How much time we got?

693
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:54,498
Thirty-three minutes.

694
00:51:55,565 --> 00:51:56,834
Is it possible?

695
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:59,003
It'll have to be.

696
00:52:19,623 --> 00:52:21,726
I'm sorry.

697
00:52:22,359 --> 00:52:24,361
Sorry was three hours ago.

698
00:52:26,596 --> 00:52:28,731
We're running outta time.
She needs our help.

699
00:52:28,733 --> 00:52:30,532
She needs to focus.
Just leave her alone.

700
00:52:30,534 --> 00:52:32,634
Alone? We're a team.

701
00:52:32,636 --> 00:52:34,571
One of us goes down,
we all do.

702
00:52:35,006 --> 00:52:35,938
Look, I...

703
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,907
I know you don't play
well with others.

704
00:52:37,909 --> 00:52:41,643
You got the whole lone wolf act down.
I get that.

705
00:52:41,645 --> 00:52:43,545
But you can't go through life
on your own.

706
00:52:43,547 --> 00:52:45,915
I've gotten by so far,
so thank you very much.

707
00:52:45,917 --> 00:52:47,283
Have ya?

708
00:52:47,285 --> 00:52:49,987
'Cause it seems to me like you
need a hand up from time to time.

709
00:52:52,556 --> 00:52:55,024
When you're on the ground,
in a gutter,

710
00:52:55,026 --> 00:52:56,659
- you know who reaches for you?
- Who?

711
00:52:56,661 --> 00:52:58,093
People who wanna use you,

712
00:52:58,095 --> 00:52:59,728
take advantage of you,

713
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:01,098
who act like
you owe them your life!

714
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,533
Whatever happened to you,

715
00:53:05,535 --> 00:53:06,671
I'm sorry.

716
00:53:07,637 --> 00:53:09,004
But we need you,

717
00:53:09,006 --> 00:53:11,707
and I'm pretty sure
you need us as well.

718
00:53:11,709 --> 00:53:12,810
All right.

719
00:53:19,549 --> 00:53:20,985
What about the liquid nitrogen?

720
00:53:23,187 --> 00:53:24,789
Could we freeze the lock?

721
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:28,489
Maybe.

722
00:53:28,491 --> 00:53:29,894
It's a long shot,
but it's worth a try.

723
00:53:41,438 --> 00:53:42,771
Look, we have an idea...

724
00:53:42,773 --> 00:53:44,139
liquid nitrogen.

725
00:53:44,141 --> 00:53:45,007
No, it... It won't work.

726
00:53:45,009 --> 00:53:46,175
There's a pressure
loaded firing pin.

727
00:53:46,177 --> 00:53:48,445
It'll trigger the re-lock
and we'll never get it open.

728
00:53:50,647 --> 00:53:52,081
How much time do we have?

729
00:53:52,083 --> 00:53:54,549
Twenty-one minutes.

730
00:53:54,551 --> 00:53:55,987
You can do it.

731
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:04,695
Forty-five.

732
00:54:10,034 --> 00:54:11,601
Sixty-three.

733
00:54:48,005 --> 00:54:50,039
- What the hell?
- What's wrong?

734
00:54:50,041 --> 00:54:51,874
I don't know.

735
00:54:54,879 --> 00:54:56,948
It won't... It's not...

736
00:55:01,752 --> 00:55:02,987
Come on!

737
00:55:04,722 --> 00:55:06,556
It should have opened!

738
00:55:09,193 --> 00:55:10,227
I let you down.

739
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:36,785
Isn't that splendid?

740
00:55:36,787 --> 00:55:40,588
- You sure they cannot see us?
- Looped the feed with the drone's memory cam.

741
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:42,858
All that prick's
looking at is Kate

742
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:44,228
sweating over and over again.

743
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:57,475
Do your thing.

744
00:57:17,188 --> 00:57:18,923
Let's pack it up.

745
00:57:29,967 --> 00:57:31,135
We're on the move.

746
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:07,870
The police?

747
00:58:07,872 --> 00:58:10,472
Every cop for 10 miles
is headed to the warehouse.

748
00:58:10,474 --> 00:58:12,274
This is our window.

749
00:58:12,276 --> 00:58:14,109
How's our team?

750
00:58:14,111 --> 00:58:15,777
En route.

751
00:58:15,779 --> 00:58:17,146
You have a job to do.

752
00:58:17,148 --> 00:58:18,415
I'll take care of it.

753
00:58:52,383 --> 00:58:54,816
Let's try another garage,
shall we?

754
00:58:54,818 --> 00:58:56,485
We're not the bleeding A-Team.

755
00:58:56,487 --> 00:58:58,055
We don't have time.

756
00:58:59,156 --> 00:59:00,691
Well, let's get going then.

757
00:59:11,202 --> 00:59:13,103
I was just trying
to make it more dramatic.

758
00:59:13,971 --> 00:59:15,139
Let's go.

759
00:59:15,773 --> 00:59:18,042
We have some shopping to do.

760
00:59:57,481 --> 00:59:59,348
You didn't buy anything?

761
00:59:59,350 --> 01:00:00,818
Didn't buy nothing.

762
01:00:12,496 --> 01:00:14,198
Better get going.

763
01:00:27,311 --> 01:00:29,378
Hey.

764
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:30,879
We don't know
how many there are.

765
01:00:30,881 --> 01:00:33,215
- If you find Theo's crew...
- When...

766
01:00:33,217 --> 01:00:34,785
I find Theo's crew.

767
01:00:35,586 --> 01:00:36,887
I'll take care of them all.

768
01:00:38,889 --> 01:00:40,188
You just worry about
the vault.

769
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:41,425
You remember what
I showed you, yeah?

770
01:00:56,273 --> 01:00:58,373
You sure you wanna do this?

771
01:00:58,375 --> 01:01:01,343
He threw us in a hole
and left us for dead.

772
01:01:01,345 --> 01:01:03,912
I'm not gonna let him
get away with it. Are you?

773
01:01:03,914 --> 01:01:05,249
Or it could be a trap.

774
01:01:06,083 --> 01:01:08,050
He thinks we're dead.

775
01:01:08,052 --> 01:01:10,485
He's never gonna see us coming.

776
01:01:10,487 --> 01:01:12,589
Not till the diamonds
are long gone.

777
01:01:36,447 --> 01:01:38,013
- He's here.
- <i>Who?</i>

778
01:01:38,015 --> 01:01:39,083
Theo.

779
01:01:41,919 --> 01:01:43,587
Hold on.
We might have a problem.

780
01:01:49,526 --> 01:01:50,994
Kate.

781
01:01:53,364 --> 01:01:54,565
You look well.

782
01:01:58,068 --> 01:01:59,534
Try it.

783
01:01:59,536 --> 01:02:02,239
It's Mortlach, 1935.

784
01:02:02,873 --> 01:02:04,641
Your grandfather's favorite.

785
01:02:07,712 --> 01:02:09,712
I'm not here for a drink.

786
01:02:09,714 --> 01:02:11,014
I'm here for the diamonds.

787
01:02:12,049 --> 01:02:13,484
Aren't we all, darling.

788
01:02:15,018 --> 01:02:16,286
Tell me something.

789
01:02:17,588 --> 01:02:19,156
What do you see?

790
01:02:23,193 --> 01:02:24,662
Wealth and privilege.

791
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:27,364
You know what I see?

792
01:02:28,632 --> 01:02:31,335
I see the lies
they tell in the morning.

793
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:34,204
These people...

794
01:02:35,038 --> 01:02:37,539
they're here to impress.

795
01:02:37,541 --> 01:02:38,542
To make a mark.

796
01:02:40,043 --> 01:02:42,577
- To be seen.
- I'm not.

797
01:02:42,579 --> 01:02:43,645
What?

798
01:02:43,647 --> 01:02:45,414
Here to be seen.

799
01:02:45,416 --> 01:02:46,684
Dressed like that?

800
01:02:50,053 --> 01:02:52,020
They think
it's an end to itself,

801
01:02:52,022 --> 01:02:53,557
but I just don't
have time for that.

802
01:02:55,225 --> 01:02:57,161
So what then? Hmm?

803
01:02:59,163 --> 01:03:01,632
What do you have time for?

804
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:07,536
Well, I like to enjoy
the finer things.

805
01:03:07,538 --> 01:03:10,574
But the acquisition
of those things...

806
01:03:11,442 --> 01:03:13,308
that's for them.

807
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:16,681
I'm addicted to savoring
the subtleties, Kate.

808
01:03:19,082 --> 01:03:20,451
I love the game.

809
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:25,055
Just don't much care
for the prize.

810
01:03:28,158 --> 01:03:30,360
You really should try it.

811
01:03:38,302 --> 01:03:42,039
The king-pawn endgame,
it's a difficult position.

812
01:03:44,208 --> 01:03:46,009
Tell me something, Kate.

813
01:03:46,811 --> 01:03:48,479
Will you become a queen?

814
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,648
I guess we'll find out.

815
01:03:54,218 --> 01:03:55,519
Well, game on.

816
01:04:07,431 --> 01:04:08,798
Oh, excuse me.

817
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,733
No, my fault.

818
01:04:10,735 --> 01:04:12,236
Enjoy your evening.

819
01:04:25,349 --> 01:04:26,416
Hmm.

820
01:04:47,204 --> 01:04:48,436
I'm here.

821
01:04:48,438 --> 01:04:50,138
Elevator is on its way.

822
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:51,809
<i>Left you a present inside.</i>

823
01:04:52,744 --> 01:04:54,844
Mag, you there?

824
01:04:54,846 --> 01:04:56,411
<i>I cannot find Theo's crew.</i>

825
01:04:56,413 --> 01:04:57,514
Keep looking.

826
01:07:02,372 --> 01:07:04,341
<i>Rowan, I'm out.
You ready to go?</i>

827
01:07:05,810 --> 01:07:06,878
Ah.

828
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:11,615
Mag, is that you?

829
01:07:12,182 --> 01:07:13,851
Who the fuck...

830
01:07:33,938 --> 01:07:35,673
Rowan, what the hell
are you doing?

831
01:08:37,334 --> 01:08:39,003
Rowan?

832
01:08:39,804 --> 01:08:41,371
Mag, can you hear me?

833
01:09:06,396 --> 01:09:07,597
Get in.

834
01:09:49,974 --> 01:09:51,173
Give me the diamonds, Kate.

835
01:09:51,175 --> 01:09:55,010
Oh, I don't have them
on me.

836
01:09:55,012 --> 01:09:56,879
You never leave
the scene with a score.

837
01:09:56,881 --> 01:09:58,546
My grandfather
taught me that much.

838
01:09:58,548 --> 01:10:00,051
I'm not holding a carrot.

839
01:10:01,018 --> 01:10:03,819
If you kill me,
your diamonds will be gone.

840
01:10:03,821 --> 01:10:04,822
I promise you that.

841
01:10:06,157 --> 01:10:08,025
So you don't care
about your own life.

842
01:10:09,526 --> 01:10:10,627
What about Rowan's?

843
01:10:18,568 --> 01:10:19,802
I just met Rowan today.

844
01:10:19,804 --> 01:10:21,070
What makes
you think I care?

845
01:10:21,072 --> 01:10:22,972
Because I know you, Kate.

846
01:10:22,974 --> 01:10:27,009
It's why I picked you.
It's why I picked all of you.

847
01:10:27,011 --> 01:10:29,046
It's why I allowed
you to escape.

848
01:10:29,881 --> 01:10:32,748
- You knew we'd escape.
- Of course.

849
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:36,218
- But you tried to kill us.
- That was motivation.

850
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:39,422
- But the other team...
- There is no other team, Kate.

851
01:10:40,658 --> 01:10:43,558
Just you. Every move you made,

852
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:46,862
every action you took,
you did it because I planned it

853
01:10:46,864 --> 01:10:48,531
and I wanted it that way.

854
01:10:49,166 --> 01:10:50,733
You were pawns in...

855
01:10:50,735 --> 01:10:53,635
Is this another
chess thing again,

856
01:10:53,637 --> 01:10:55,405
because I should mention
I'm more of a Monopoly girl.

857
01:10:56,007 --> 01:10:57,742
- Thimble?
- Top hat.

858
01:11:02,579 --> 01:11:04,447
I want the diamonds, Kate.

859
01:11:05,615 --> 01:11:07,515
You kill me, you have nothing.

860
01:11:07,517 --> 01:11:09,151
I have Rowan,

861
01:11:09,153 --> 01:11:11,153
and we can make him
talk eventually.

862
01:11:11,155 --> 01:11:13,789
But Rowan doesn't know
where the diamonds are.

863
01:11:13,791 --> 01:11:15,090
It's just me.

864
01:11:15,092 --> 01:11:17,662
And if I die,
your diamonds are gone.

865
01:11:19,196 --> 01:11:21,263
That would be a mistake.

866
01:11:21,265 --> 01:11:23,265
For you.

867
01:11:23,267 --> 01:11:26,001
See, there's no way that you
financed this whole thing yourself.

868
01:11:26,003 --> 01:11:27,903
So, I'm betting you had
a buyer.

869
01:11:27,905 --> 01:11:30,839
A buyer who fronted you
enough for this whole operation,

870
01:11:30,841 --> 01:11:32,174
the replica and all.

871
01:11:32,176 --> 01:11:33,909
And I'm gonna bet
that this buyer

872
01:11:33,911 --> 01:11:36,511
isn't the type to just write
this off if you don't deliver.

873
01:11:36,513 --> 01:11:38,983
So... am I close?

874
01:11:44,088 --> 01:11:47,756
The diamonds, Kate.

875
01:11:47,758 --> 01:11:49,258
If I don't tell you
where they are,

876
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:51,660
no matter
what happens to me,

877
01:11:51,662 --> 01:11:53,030
they'll come for you.

878
01:11:54,899 --> 01:11:56,767
Are there dice in Chess?

879
01:12:01,538 --> 01:12:02,907
Oh, very well.

880
01:12:03,975 --> 01:12:06,543
Kei, call Vince.

881
01:12:08,713 --> 01:12:13,117
Let's give Kate a little taste
of what's about to come.

882
01:12:24,729 --> 01:12:26,496
Is there a problem, Kei?

883
01:13:05,236 --> 01:13:08,072
Oh, Jesus Christ.

884
01:13:54,051 --> 01:13:55,653
Mag, are you there?

885
01:13:57,721 --> 01:14:00,191
Mag, can you hear me?
I'm heading to the rendezvous point.

886
01:14:12,436 --> 01:14:14,436
- Mag?
- What happened?

887
01:14:14,438 --> 01:14:16,006
Yeah, we gotta go.

888
01:14:16,774 --> 01:14:17,975
Let's go.

889
01:14:20,111 --> 01:14:21,310
Mag, what the hell
are you doing?

890
01:14:21,312 --> 01:14:22,813
I'm sorry, Kate.

891
01:14:43,267 --> 01:14:44,735
You don't have to do this.

892
01:14:46,971 --> 01:14:48,370
It's not too late.

893
01:14:48,372 --> 01:14:49,874
It is for me.

894
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:20,704
How much is he paying you?

895
01:15:21,272 --> 01:15:22,273
I didn't pay her.

896
01:15:24,008 --> 01:15:25,209
I raised her.

897
01:15:33,918 --> 01:15:37,386
Kate, let's just stop this,
all right.

898
01:15:37,388 --> 01:15:39,188
Make it easy on ourselves,

899
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:40,991
and just tell me
where the diamonds are.

900
01:15:41,992 --> 01:15:44,993
The diamonds are the only
thing keeping me alive.

901
01:15:44,995 --> 01:15:47,131
The diamonds are gonna
get you killed.

902
01:15:48,098 --> 01:15:49,433
And is it worth it?

903
01:15:51,202 --> 01:15:52,403
No.

904
01:15:54,205 --> 01:15:56,972
But making you fail,
that's something I would die for.

905
01:15:56,974 --> 01:16:00,044
- Shoot her.
- We should just take her and go.

906
01:16:01,045 --> 01:16:03,781
She'll talk... eventually.

907
01:16:05,082 --> 01:16:08,517
You know,
I don't think she will.

908
01:16:08,519 --> 01:16:12,387
We need to reassess,
and we need to clear the board.

909
01:16:12,389 --> 01:16:14,256
I don't want any loose ends.
Shoot her.

910
01:16:14,258 --> 01:16:15,791
No, we need
to get out of here now.

911
01:16:15,793 --> 01:16:16,927
This is not the time
or the place for this.

912
01:16:18,095 --> 01:16:19,396
What did you say?

913
01:16:20,931 --> 01:16:24,034
I'm just saying that
I think that there is...

914
01:16:27,805 --> 01:16:30,305
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

915
01:16:30,307 --> 01:16:31,976
Don't listen to her.

916
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:35,377
For what he did to you.

917
01:16:35,379 --> 01:16:37,214
For what he made you become.

918
01:16:38,415 --> 01:16:39,950
Magdalena...

919
01:16:42,486 --> 01:16:43,988
do it.

920
01:16:45,089 --> 01:16:46,290
Do it.

921
01:16:47,124 --> 01:16:48,259
Do it!

922
01:17:01,839 --> 01:17:04,008
I love you like a daughter,
you know that.

923
01:17:05,242 --> 01:17:06,877
Like a daughter.

924
01:17:12,283 --> 01:17:14,318
I'm sorry.

925
01:17:25,462 --> 01:17:27,896
Okay, last chance.

926
01:17:27,898 --> 01:17:30,065
What did you do to her?

927
01:17:30,067 --> 01:17:32,868
What did I do to her?
I saved her. Okay.

928
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:35,871
Her family dead,
she was on the streets

929
01:17:35,873 --> 01:17:38,073
and I gave her everything.
What do you care?

930
01:17:38,075 --> 01:17:40,042
You turned her into a weapon.

931
01:17:40,044 --> 01:17:41,543
I saved her from
becoming a corpse,

932
01:17:41,545 --> 01:17:43,380
and you made me
shoot her!

933
01:17:51,422 --> 01:17:53,390
I really didn't want it
to end this way, Kate.

934
01:18:04,501 --> 01:18:05,969
I'm okay.

935
01:18:20,652 --> 01:18:23,520
I come in here and save
your arses again, huh?

936
01:18:39,069 --> 01:18:40,504
Take a seat there.

937
01:18:45,542 --> 01:18:47,644
You left 'em in
a bleedin' bush?

938
01:18:50,247 --> 01:18:52,082
- Thought you were smarter than that.
- Yeah?

939
01:18:53,617 --> 01:18:55,018
I was hoping Theo would too.

940
01:18:55,720 --> 01:18:57,154
You all right?

941
01:18:58,622 --> 01:19:00,624
I take no chances anymore.

942
01:19:01,726 --> 01:19:04,159
It's twist after twist
with you, huh?

943
01:19:04,161 --> 01:19:06,328
It's like screwing on
a bottle cap.

944
01:19:06,330 --> 01:19:08,063
Ow, it hurts to laugh.

945
01:19:08,065 --> 01:19:09,466
Here, gimme a look at those.

946
01:19:19,510 --> 01:19:21,111
You took a chance on me.

947
01:19:21,713 --> 01:19:23,447
You didn't have to.

948
01:19:24,548 --> 01:19:26,651
It wasn't a chance,
it was a choice.

949
01:19:27,451 --> 01:19:28,552
You made one too.

950
01:19:31,121 --> 01:19:33,155
Don't worry, we're good.

951
01:19:33,157 --> 01:19:35,624
That was beautiful,
just gorgeous,

952
01:19:35,626 --> 01:19:39,127
but, uh, Mag's just been shot,
I'm bleeding outside a church,

953
01:19:39,129 --> 01:19:41,163
and you're holding
a bag of diamonds.

954
01:19:41,165 --> 01:19:43,632
- So... I think we better skedaddle.
- Yeah.

955
01:19:43,634 --> 01:19:45,335
There's a couple of things
I wanna take care of.

956
01:20:28,245 --> 01:20:29,747
<i>Surprised to see me?</i>

957
01:20:31,448 --> 01:20:34,017
<i>Kiss my bollocks,
you baldy prick.</i>

958
01:20:42,493 --> 01:20:43,761
Game over.

959
01:20:57,174 --> 01:20:59,978
- To Grayson.
- That cocky bastard.

960
01:21:07,217 --> 01:21:08,751
Wasn't too hard
to find the painting?

961
01:21:08,753 --> 01:21:10,454
Oh, I slipped through.

962
01:21:12,724 --> 01:21:14,224
Thank you.

963
01:21:21,799 --> 01:21:23,600
You got something for me?

964
01:21:57,334 --> 01:21:59,269
- Done.
- That's it?

965
01:22:00,337 --> 01:22:01,471
That's it.

966
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:05,375
Thanks for saving me a step.

967
01:22:06,610 --> 01:22:08,278
Never liked that guy.

968
01:22:11,248 --> 01:22:12,482
I'll be in touch.

969
01:22:22,827 --> 01:22:25,228
So... what's next?

970
01:22:26,196 --> 01:22:28,330
We all betray each other,

971
01:22:28,332 --> 01:22:30,933
Kate turns out to be
Grayson's daughter.

972
01:22:30,935 --> 01:22:33,604
We'll whip off the mask,
and it's Scooby Doo?

973
01:22:34,906 --> 01:22:36,340
Maybe.

974
01:22:37,441 --> 01:22:38,743
But first...

975
01:22:39,911 --> 01:22:41,511
you ever been to Italy?

976
01:23:29,694 --> 01:23:31,294
How's that?

977
01:23:33,463 --> 01:23:37,534
I think just a little bit...

978
01:23:39,636 --> 01:23:41,371
All about the angles.

979
01:23:44,608 --> 01:23:45,875
It's good?

980
01:23:45,877 --> 01:23:48,512
Just a little...
Just a little bit

981
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:50,713
to the right.

982
01:23:50,715 --> 01:23:53,581
Oh, a touch...

983
01:23:53,583 --> 01:23:54,886
There.

984
01:23:57,889 --> 01:23:59,724
I think it suits the place.

985
01:24:02,292 --> 01:24:03,861
It's like having a painting
of your face.

986
01:24:05,730 --> 01:24:09,031
Where are we going next?

987
01:24:09,033 --> 01:24:10,866
Italy.
We already decided in the last meet.

988
01:24:10,868 --> 01:24:11,903
Remember?

989
01:24:12,064 --> 01:24:17,064
