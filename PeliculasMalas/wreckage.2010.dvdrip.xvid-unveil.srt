1
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,750
Turn that damned TV down.

2
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,740
I told you
to turn the damn TV down.

3
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,790
Where the hell have you been,
Jimmy?

4
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,250
Who cares?
I'm here now, ain't I?

5
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,090
Where is my shit?

6
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,090
Christ, chill out, bitch.

7
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,270
Here.

8
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,610
What you little shits watching?

9
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,910
Yo, kid, give me
that damned remote.

10
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,620
What, am I
speaking Chinese?

11
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,460
Give me that remote.
No.

12
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,880
What did you say to me?

13
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,710
We're watching.
I don't give a shit.

14
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,170
When I tell you to do something,
you better do it.

15
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,430
You ain't my Dad.
You can't tell me what to do. Yeah?

16
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,600
Get off me.
You better learn some respect, boy.

17
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,060
Don't ever touch me again. What you going to do,
you little piece of shit, huh?

18
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:05,980
Fuck you.

19
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,150
Huh? Huh?

20
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,110
Huh? What do you say?
Jimmy, no!

21
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,030
What do you say?
Get off.

22
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,660
Get off me,
you crazy bitch. Get off.

23
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:14,700
You piece of shit, huh? Huh?

24
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,710
Go away.

25
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,550
Put the gun down, Ricky.

26
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,840
You better put that gun down.

27
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,590
You gonna shoot me?

28
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,590
Is that what you're
going to do, boy?

29
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,140
Jimmy, stop it.
Ricky, put the gun down.

30
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,440
Ricky, what did you do?

31
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,320
Wesley, call an ambulance.

32
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,280
Come on, Ricky.
Let's get out of here.

33
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,070
Wesley, call an ambulance,
goddamn it.

34
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,530
What are you doing,
Ricky? Come on.

35
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,660
Ricky, what did you do?

36
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,870
Put that gun down.
Ricky, no.

37
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:54,130
How you doing, darling?

38
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,510
Everything okay?

39
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,220
My car died.

40
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,010
You need some help?

41
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:02,890
No. My boyfriend is

42
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,860
on his way with a tow truck, and
he should be here any minute.

43
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,030
Well, in the
meantime, do you want

44
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,360
to pop the hood,
let me take a look?

45
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,780
That's okay.
Tow truck will be here soon.

46
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,320
Oh, come on, now.

47
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,040
You know, what kind
of harm will it do?

48
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,000
Let me just
take a look.

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,830
Yeah?
I guess not.

50
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,000
All right.

51
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,200
Shit.

52
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,080
The battery's dead.

53
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,920
It's probably
the alternator.

54
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,380
Mm, that's what I figured.

55
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,880
I'd give her a jump, but

56
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,800
I don't think this
thing takes cables.

57
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,100
You know about cars, huh?
My daddy taught me

58
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,310
just enough to not get ripped
off at the Jiffy Lube.

59
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,110
Good man,
your daddy.

60
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,190
My name's Kane,
by the way.

61
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,110
Savannah.

62
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,660
Very nice to meet
you, Savannah.

63
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,620
Well, can I give
you a ride somewhere?

64
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,750
No. Tow truck will be here soon,
I'll be fine.

65
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,670
That's right.

66
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,590
You mentioned that
he was coming.

67
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,010
Okay.

68
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,550
Well,

69
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,970
thanks for trying
to help, though.

70
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,180
Oh, it's the, uh...

71
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,640
It's the least I could do.

72
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,940
Plus, you remind me
of my little sister.

73
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,150
You know, Savannah, it's,
um... it's awfully cold.

74
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,490
You're more than welcome
to wait in my truck

75
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,830
until your boyfriend gets here.

76
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,290
No, I'll be fine here.

77
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,000
Savannah,

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,460
Savannah, Savannah,
I got to tell you.

79
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,590
It's pretty dangerous for
a pretty girl like yourself

80
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,760
to be out here all alone,
in the middle of nowhere.

81
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,100
Now, my truck's warm and
safe, and I won't bite.

82
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,900
Seriously,
I don't bite.

83
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,610
Hmm.

84
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,870
Okay.

85
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,530
All right.

86
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,830
It's right over there.
It's unlocked.

87
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,040
There you go.

88
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,510
All units,
all units, prisoner at large.

89
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,630
I repeat, prisoner
at large.

90
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,430
Roger that. Who is it?

91
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,980
Inmate 868621,
Wesley Jones.

92
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,980
Copy that.

93
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,030
What was he in for?

94
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,150
Double homicide.

95
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,490
Shot his mom and boyfriend
when he was a kid.

96
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,020
Now, ain't this better?

97
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,060
Thank you for helping me.

98
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,860
Of course,
of course.

99
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,070
It's what any
gentleman would do.

100
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,240
Hope someone would do the same
for my little sister, you know.

101
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,620
All right, folks,
sorry for interrupting,

102
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,080
but we have
a special news report.

103
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,620
At approximately 11:30
this evening,

104
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,750
an inmate
at the state prison escaped.

105
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,460
Police are on the scene,

106
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,630
and a countywide manhunt
is underway.

107
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,720
The prisoner is considered
extremely dangerous.

108
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,550
If you have any information,

109
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:52,060
please contact
your local police.

110
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,900
Bet you're happy I'm
here now, ain't you?

111
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,070
Don't you worry, Savannah.

112
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,490
Any convict comes
through this way

113
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,490
is going to have
to come through this.

114
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,790
Oh.

115
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,710
So, uh, where did you say

116
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,130
that boyfriend
of yours is coming from?

117
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,140
Uh, Spring Valley.

118
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,890
It's 20 miles up the road.

119
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,890
Right.

120
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,650
How long ago did you say
you called him?

121
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,280
Just right before you pulled up.

122
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,570
Uh-huh.

123
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,700
You know what
I'm thinking, sweetheart?

124
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,960
Uh-uh.
I'm thinking

125
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,170
you never called your boyfriend,
because you ain't got

126
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,800
no cell phone reception.

127
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,380
And I'm thinking that...

128
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,140
we're out here, all alone,

129
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,850
in the middle
of nowhere.

130
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:45,150
I'm thinking you got one hell
of a pretty face.

131
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,610
Please.
I don't want any trouble.

132
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,410
Oh, neither do I.

133
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,040
Sweetheart,

134
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,710
this is going to go one
or two ways, all right?

135
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,380
This could be real pleasant

136
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,050
for the both of us, or it

137
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,560
could get really ugly.

138
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,190
No, don't do this.

139
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,940
You're 18, right?

140
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,020
So you're old enough.

141
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,610
You know the sound a woman makes
when she's having an orgasm.

142
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,950
It's the same sound she makes

143
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,500
when she's being stabbed
to death.

144
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,000
Oh.

145
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,920
Now, I need to hear either one,
you know, so...

146
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,270
You're only making it worse.

147
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,150
Help! Help me!

00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,620
Please help me! Please help me!

149
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,410
Please help me. Please.

150
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,670
You got nowhere to go.

151

Oh, my God.
Help me, oh, my God, help!

What you got?

184
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,040
Looks like somebody escaped

185
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,300
from the state prison
early this morning.

186
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,130
No shit.
Who is it?

187
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:47,720
I don't know.

188
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,140
It says something
about a serial killer.

189
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,600
I can't read it, though.

190
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,060
The fax is all
messed up.

191
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,060
Maybe it's Charles Manson.

192
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,610
Charles Manson?

193
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,900
Shit, he's not even up here.

194
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,570
He's in California somewhere.

195
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,780
Besides, he ain't...
he ain't no real serial killer.

196
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,790
It's probably that, uh...

197
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:05,370
Juan Corona fella.

198
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,420
I hear they got him up there.

199
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,880
Ron Corona?
Yeah,

200
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,970
Juan Corona--
that crazy Mexican nut job.

201
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,760
No.

202
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,730
He killed 25 people
up in Yuba City using a machete.

203
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,060
He hacked 'em up real good.

204
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,770
Ugh. When did that happen?

205
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:21,860
About 30 years ago.

206
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,740
I wasn't even born then.

207
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,950
Yeah, you were probably
still swimming

208
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,330
up in your daddy's nut sack.

209
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:27,540
What?

210
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,500
What?

211
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,210
You can't hear me
with them Dumbo ears?

212
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,090

Well, you got
a kid with her--

273
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,990
you don't really
have much choice.

Maybe you should try.

00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,740
So, um, how's she, uh,
how's she running?

282
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,620
Oh, she's purring
like a kitten.

283
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:43,290
But she'll bite you like a dog.

284
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,340
Ah, it sounds
like Jessica.

285
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,720
Yeah, so I bored out
the cylinders at 60,

286
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,800
put a stroker kit in it--
I'm running about

287
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,760
500 horsepower.

288
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,310
Oh, she'll fly.

289
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,810
Enough to win, huh?

290
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:54,900
Oh, yeah.

291
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,820
She'll win.

292
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,410
Yes, she will.

Let's go.

294
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,700
Do this!

295
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,330
Want me to drive, too?

296
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,500
No, we can all
ride together.

297
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,550
Oh, great.
Well, then, uh....

298
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,920
after you, my darling.

299
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,390
Yeah, um...

300
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,390
you're in
the backseat now.

301
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,310
What are you
talking about, now?

302
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,430
See this?

303
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,020
Bam!
Ah.

304
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,860
Shotgun for life.
Wow!

305
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,990
For life. Wow, wow,
you motherfucker. No, I see how it is.

306
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,830
I get it.
It's cool, it's cool.

307
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:27,620
Hey, baby.
Lover.

308
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,710

it again? Lookit.

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,010
Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait.
And now, bam!

311
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,680
Hey, Sheriff?

312
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,140
Sheriff?

313
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,810
You... want to look at this?

314
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,060
No need to.

315
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,270
I heard everything you said.

316
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,190
So, what do you
think we should do?

317
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,110
Well, what did they
tell us to do?

318
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:50,410
It doesn't say
we should do anything.

319
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,750
: That's exactly what we're gonna do, then.

320
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,580
Why don't we go set up
a roadblock?

321
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,590
Look, if you
want to stand

322
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,260
in the middle of the road

323
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,010
with your thumb up your ass,
be my guest.

324
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,430
Now, the last time I checked,

325
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,140
that jail was
60 miles away,

326
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:05,310
which means we're 50 miles away
from the search area.

327
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,860
Oh.

328
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,370
So we're not gonna do anything?

329
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,790
You're not very bright, are you?

330
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,210
No, sir, not really.

331
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,130
Well, at least you're honest.

332
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,010
Yeah.

333
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,480
Thank you.

334
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,190

why would a serial killer

00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:41,330

Need a tow

363
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,530
Funny.

364
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,280
Seriously, dude,

365
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,580
it's time to ditch the dinosaur.

366
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,710
It's a piece of crap.

367
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,330
You know what, man, don't
get me started, all right?

368
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,590
You want to fuck off.

369
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,420
Hey, don't be bitter.

370
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,140
Just call me when you want
to lose some more money.

371
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,390
I don't know, maybe
we'll race for your girl.

372
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,230
Hey, why don't you go
back to your daddy,

373
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:31,270
so you can get the rest of your
inheritance by sucking his dick?

374
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,610
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Hey!

375
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,280
Fuck, bro, there
goes our ride.

376
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,620
You okay, babe?

377
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,500
Yeah, I'm okay.

378
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,170
Can't say the
same for the car.

379
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,420
What the hell happened, man?

380
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,550
You totally had him.

381
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:49,140
Well, I lost a belt,
looks like I blew a gasket.

382
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,350
God, this is such a mess.

383
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,020
This thing's a fucking
time bomb, man.

384
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,860
It's time for something newer.

385
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,280
When you get a car, then maybe
I'll actually entertain

386
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,950
this conver...
Cars cause air pollution, my friend.

387
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:02,280
Yeah? So does the air that
comes out of your mouth.

388
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,410
Can you fix it?

389
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,830
Well, not unless you got

390
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:05,750
a belt hidden
somewhere in there.

391
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,380
All right, well,

392
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,550
how are we gonna get home?

393
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:10,260
I don't know.

394
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,970
And of course, I
have no reception.

395
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,140
Do you have any?
Mm...

396
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,980
Ah, Jesus Christ.
No.

397
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,150
Shh...
Nada.

398
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,730
Well, I suppose that,
uh, you haven't gotten

399
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:22,360
a cell phone in
the last 12 hours.

400
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,490
Cell phones cause brain tumors.
You're all gonna...

401
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:27,290
You need to get a job, man.

402
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:29,080
You can say that again.
What?

403
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,420
What? Look who's talking,
Little Miss Food Stamps.

404
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,840
Okay.

405
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,550
Well, we could
stand around here

406
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,380
wait for somebody
to drive by,

407
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,850
or we can hoof
it back to town.

408
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,770
Are you crazy?

409
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,350
It's, like, ten miles back
to town, and I'm pregnant.

410
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,770
It's more like
four miles.

411
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,020
And last time
I checked,

412
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,780
exercise doesn't
hurt a fetus.

413
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,860
It's not even a fetus.
It's only six weeks.

414
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,110
Six weeks.
Jesus Christ.

415
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,950
Yeah, well, I have
heels on, okay,

416
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,370
so, we need a better
fucking plan.

417
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:52,910
Well, I am open
for suggestions.

418
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:54,830
Okay, why don't you two
push the car back,

419
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:57,090
Kate can steer,
and I can lie in the back?

420
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,090
That's a great idea. Now,
is she always this crazy,

421
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,590
or is this just the
hormones talking?

422
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,930
Hey, hey, no, no, no, no,
welcome to my-my world.

423
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:03,720
You're a fucking asshole.

424
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,100
All right, look, there's got
to be something that we can do.

425
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,850
Let's focus.
What can we do?

426
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,360
Guys, it's only four...
it's four miles. No way.

427
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,860
I am not walking back from there.
Well, then,

428
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,820
I guess we're just going
to leave you here then.

429
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,990
What, you can't just
leave me here.

430
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,370
Okay, wait, wait,
okay, wait, wait.

431
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:15,540
What about the,
um... the junkyard

432
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,460
down the road?
What about it?

433
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,750
I mean, can't you get a gasket
or a belt from one of them cars?

434
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,430
It's, like, a mile
down the road.

435
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,970
Yeah, that can work.
I'm down.

436
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,470
Yeah?

437
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,520
No, Rick. My feet hurt.
I don't want to walk.

438
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,730
Oh, Jesus Christ, baby,
listen, you're pregnant, okay?

439
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,360
You're not...
you're not crippled.

440
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,990
Oh, besides,

441
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,620
you could stand
to lose a few pounds.

442
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,740
Fuck you, you
piece of shit.

443
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,500
Oh, shit.
You see?

444
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,870
One night
without a fucking condom,

445
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:44,290
I'm stuck with her
for the rest of my life.

446
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:46,470
Jesus Christ!

447
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,430
What, are you
proposing?

448
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,140
I'm saying no.

449
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,310
Really?

450
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,690
I mean, obviously, you know,
kid's gonna grow up just fine.

451
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,530
A fucking...
Yeah.

452
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,280
Jesus Christ.

453
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,450
Oh, yeah, well,
that's great.

454
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,250
What?

455
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,670
Oh, dude,
that's bullshit.

456
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,420
Any time you see
a sign that says,

457
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,260
"Beware of dogs,"
there's never dogs.

458
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,510
Yeah, well why don't you,
uh, hop on over

459
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,430
and, uh, prove
that little theory of yours?

460
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,100
Here, boy!

461
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,150
Here, doggy, doggy, doggy!

462
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,950
See? Nothing.

463
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:51,200
All right, well...
you first.

464
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,160
What, army boy's
scared to...?

465
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,630
No, army boy is smart.

466
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:59,800
Yeah, all right,
fuck it, fuck it.

467
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,010
All right.

468
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,140
Move it, move it,
move it, move it!

469
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,310
Over that wall,
over that wall!

470
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,960
See? I told you,
nothing. Nothing.

471
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,130
Here, babe,
here's the toolbox.

472
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,590
Thank you, babe.

473
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,220
You going
to be all right?

474
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:31,150
Be careful with that.

475
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,110
I will. Oh.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

476
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,320
Wait a second.
Guys, what about me?

477
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,870
Hey, just stay there, Fatty.
We'll be back in a few.

478
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,170
Fuck that.

479
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,970
You coming?

480
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,680
Yeah, I'm fucking coming...
you shit. Oh.

481
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,680
Oh, she's throwing her shoes,
throwing her shoes.

482
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:59,780
Any old American model should work.

483
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,280
I'm gonna check this guy out.

484
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,750
I don't like it
in here.

485
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,580
Me, either.
It gives me the creeps.

486
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,130
That's because
this is haunted.

487
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:10,300
This place was built on top
of an old Indian burial ground.

488
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,300
How do you know?

489
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,850
I used to come here all the time

490
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:15,600
when I was a kid
with my dad.

491
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,890
He knew the old Indian guy
that ran the place.

492
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,020
He used to tell us,
how late at night,

493
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:24,360
he'd hear screams and ghosts
of his slaughtered ancestors.

494
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,410
Wait. Listen.

495
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,000
What?

496
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,410
Shh. Listen.

497
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,250
What?

498
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,210
Do you guys hear that?

499
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,100
He's just messing
with you, baby.

500
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,180
Hey, I'm serious.

501
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,930
You are such a liar.

502
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,190
No, I'm not lying.

503
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,690
I used to come here
all the time

504
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,030
when I was a kid
with my dad.

505
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,570
The old Indian guy lived here.

506
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:49,660
He died in
here, too.

507
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:51,330
Oh, yeah?
How did he die?

508
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:53,250
Some say suicide.

509
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:56,380
Others say murder.

510
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,250
Well,
would you just quit screwing around

511
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,010
and help me look?

512
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,050
Ah, I don't know.

513
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,230
Jesus!

514
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,660
Oh,
that was the funniest thing I've ever seen.

515
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,670
Yeah, so much
for your no dog theory.

516
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,130
Huh?

517
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,750
I'm still working on the kinks.

518
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,880
Hey, will you just quit screwing
around and help me look?

519
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,560
Oh, fuck. Fuck you.

520
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,860
Yeah, that
one's locked.

521
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,160
Let go.

522
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,290
Fuck.

523
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:54,480
Hey, yo, Jared,
I think I found one, man.

524
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,240
I think you're right.

525
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,820
Is it gonna work?

526
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:05,080
Ah, it should.

527
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,460
How long do you think it'll take?

528
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,380
Oh, not too long.

529
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,170
Ah, this place is wild,
isn't it?

530
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:13,970
It's like an old cemetery
for cars, each with

531
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,310
its own unique story.

532
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:17,890
Oh, Jesus,
like this fucking truck.

533
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,150
What about it?

534
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:21,190
A family died in this truck.

535
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,690
Yeah, right.

536
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:23,990
No, I'm serious.

537
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,370
My dad told me
the story.

538
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,870
He knew 'em.

539
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,370
What happened?

540
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:30,250
It happened, like,
20 years ago. Get this.

541
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:33,420
Husband, wife, newborn baby,
heading home from the hospital,

542
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:35,300
get in a head-on collision
with another car.

543
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,390
Husband dies instantly,

544
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:39,100
head severed
clean off his body.

545
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,480
Wife and baby weren't
so lucky, though.

546
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,110
Wife's legs were crushed
underneath the dashboard.

547
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:48,160
She was stuck with
the newborn baby in her lap,

548
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,910
and her husband's head
sitting next to her.

549
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:53,290
Truck catches on
fire, and they both

550
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,250
slowly started
to burn to death.

551
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,130
And she's screaming, you know,

552
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,720
desperately trying to get her
baby out the window, but

553
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,890
the window's rolled up, and...
she can't reach the handle.

554
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:07,270
And the fire engulfs them,
and they...

555
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,650
both die.

556
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:13,450
It's rumored that people
could hear the screaming

557
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:16,500
from miles and miles away.

558
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,080
But right
before she died,

559
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,510
fire reaches the
gas tank and...

560
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,430
Jesus fucking Christ!

561
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:26,970
Fucking idiot, Rick.

562
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:28,140
Holy shit, you should
have seen your faces.

563
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,940
What the fuck, dude?

564
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,150
Did you forget to take
your Prozac? Jesus Christ.

565
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,780
Come on, man,
you should have seen it.

566
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,400
It was the funniest fucking shit
in the world.

567
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,780
You should have seen their faces.
Give me that.

568
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,410
What?

569
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,500
What the... what the hell
are you doing with this?

570
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,580
What, man? Come on.

571
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,510
There's bears, mountain lions,
some rabbits, gophers, what?

572
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,890
Just keep it on safety
and put it away.

573
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,520
Jesus. Fucking idiot.

574
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,390
Babe, how much longer
is it gonna take?

575
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:55,020
'Cause I really don't want
to be here anymore.

576
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,980
Soon.
- Yo, uh, J?

577
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,610
How much you give me
if I hit this, uh,

578
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:00,740
mirror off this old van
right here?

579
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,740
Nothing.
Come on, man.

580
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,580
It's a tough shot.

581
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,170
Stop shooting
that thing!

582
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,670
Oh, yeah! Holy
shit, what a shot!

583
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,380
You're such an idiot.

584
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,800
Dude, quit messing around.
One last shot.

585
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,130
One last shot?
Okay, girls? Don't.

586
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,890
Girls, cover your ears.

587
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,010
Stop shooting it! Don't!

588
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,600
Hey, asshole,

589
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,770
if you fire off one more shot...

590
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,790
Jared?

591
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:31,290
Kate.

592
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:34,340
Kate? Kate?!

593
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,260
Oh, my God.

594
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:39,180
Oh, my God, what the
fuck did you do, man?

595
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,730
What the fuck did you do?!

596
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:41,810
I was just aiming
over here, man!

597
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:42,980
Goddamn it, Rick.

598
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,570
Oh, shit.

599
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:49,660
Oh. Oh, God! Oh, shit.

600
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,620
Oh, baby, it hurts.
All right. I know.

601
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,660
Baby, it hurts.
I know it does.

602
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,290
Baby, it hurts,
it hurts.

603
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:56,090
Stay calm, stay calm,
all right, listen to me.

604
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,760
Okay, the more relaxed
and calm you are,

605
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,550
the less the bleeding
is going to be, okay?

606
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,220
I'm gonna go get you help,
you understand?

607
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,140
Hey, man, I'm sorry.

608
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,930
I was just aiming over there,
man, I was just aiming

609
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:06,560
over here, and it just...
Not now, Rick!

610
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,360
Fuck.

611
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,570
All right, I need you
to put pressure down, okay?

612
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:11,990
Just keep her calm.

613
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:13,530
Can you do that for me?
Okay, yeah.

614
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:14,580
What are you gonna do, man?!

615
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,830
I'm gonna go run back
into town, okay?

616
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:20,340
Hey, look, hey,
hey, honey.

617
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,010
You see that?

618
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:24,800
Oh, fuck.

619
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,050
You see that?

620
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,930
That means we're
getting married.

621
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,190
Fuck.

622
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,650
Fuck!

623
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,380
Fucking hurts.

624
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,920
Ow.

625
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,340
Oh, fuck,
I'm sorry, Kate.

626
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,850
I'm sorry, Kate.

627
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,350
You fucking asshole!

628
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,310
I can't believe
you just fucking did that!

629
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,810
What the fuck's
your problem?!

630
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:55,900
If she dies,
you're going to jail,

631
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,730
you fucking motherfucker!
Fuck!

632
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,650
Oh, my God.

633
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,580
Will you marry me?

634
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,460
Oh, my God,

635
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,630
oh, my God, yes, yes, yes.

636
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,130
I was just aiming over there, man.

637
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,340
I was just aiming
over here.

638
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,340
What are you
gonna do, man?!

639
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,890
Is that a yes?

640
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,270
I was just
aiming over here.

641
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,940
Is that a yes? What are
you gonna do, man?!

642
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,520
Yes?
What are you gonna do, man?!

643
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,900
Hey, hey, hey, hey, what
the hell are you doing,

644
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,700
son?
My girlfriend's just been shot.

645
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,490
You got to go get help.
What's happening?

646
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,000
Kate, Kate--
she's been shot.

647
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,540
She's at the old junkyard
on Highway 13.

648
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,750
We got to go
get her help.

649
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,380
James, get on the horn
to Dr. Richardson,

650
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,590
tell her to meet us at Jay's
Junkyard with the ambulance,

651
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,840
and you stay here,
hold down the fort.

652
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,390
Stay here, all right.

653
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,180
Bye.

654
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,060
Get on the phone.

655
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,490
Grab the stretcher.

656
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,390
Well, all right,
where are they?

657
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:27,930
They were right here.

658
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:28,980
They're not here now.
What the fuck?

659
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,690
They were right here.

660
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,270
Kate!

661
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,780
Rick!
Is this some kind

662
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,570
of a game
you're playing?

663
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,410
Kate!

664
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:38,280
I swear to God,
I told 'em to stay put.

665
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,540
They were right here.

666
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,000
'Cause if you're fucking
with me,

667
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,620
I won't hesitate to throw
your ass in jail.

668
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,920
Why would I make this up, huh?

669
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,880
Look, look at this.

670
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,020
Does that look
like ketchup to you?

671
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,350
What the hell's
going on?

672
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:55,900
- I don't know.
- Hey, Sheriff,

673
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,070
maybe somebody came
by and found 'em,

674
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:58,820
took 'em to
the hospital.

675
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,530
No, that's impossible.
Why?

676
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:02,160
Because I would have passed
them when I ran into town,

677
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,790
or they would have passed us
when we came back here.

678
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:05,790
You don't know that for sure.
You know

679
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:07,630
of any other roads
that come through here, genius?

680
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,630
Don't you get smart
with me, boy.

681
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,970
You wouldn't know
if I got smart with you.

682
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:12,510
All right, knock it off.

683
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,180
Now, look, there's,
there's got to be

684
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,770
a logical explanation to this.

685
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:18,600
Your friends have
to be here somewhere.

686
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,980
We'd better hurry,
Sheriff, she's bleeding.

687
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,570
All right, let's split up.

688
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:26,330
Now, uh, Faye, you go with him,
check that lower area.

689
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:29,370
Janet, you and I will circle
around this way.

690
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:30,710
Let's get out of here.
Hey, Sheriff.

691
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,590
Yeah?
You have an extra gun on you?

692
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,050
Yes, I do.

693
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:36,180
Come on.

694
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:39,060
Rick!

695
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,850
Rick!

696
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,490
Rick!

697
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,910
Kate!

698
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,590
Rick!

699
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,970
Kate!

700
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:05,890
What the hell were y'all
doing out here anyway?

701
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,860
I blew a belt,
we were looking for a spare one.

702
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,530
You find one?
Hey, wait, wait.

703
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,660
What?

704
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,450
Listen.

705
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,830
Did you hear that?

706
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:19,420
What?
Shh, be quiet.

707
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,210
That-- did you
hear that?

708
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:24,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

709
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,100
I think it's over here.

710
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,240
Rick! Jessica!

711
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,000
Hello-- hello.

712
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:46,260
Faye! Faye, where are you?!

713
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,880
Faye!

714
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,850
I'm over here.

715
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,150
Oh, fuck!

716
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,900
Sheriff, Sheriff!

717
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,780
Get her down.

718
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:28,250
Oh, fuck, Sheriff!

719
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:30,750
Sheriff!

720
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,380
No, Jessica!
Sheriff!

721
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:34,800
Oh, fuck!
Get over here quick.

722
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,470
Oh, fuck,
Sheriff.

723
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:39,890
Sheriff,
get over here quick!

724
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:41,520
Sheriff!

725
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,190
Wait.

726
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,690
Jessica!

727
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:46,440
Oh, fuck...

728
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,200
Oh, fuck.

729
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,780
Jessica!

730
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,040
Jessica!

731
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,840
Two bullet wounds to the chest
at point-blank range,

732
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,430
which killed her

733
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,100
before the laceration
to the neck.

734
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,770
The only good news is,

735
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:04,980
she probably
didn't suffer.

736
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:12,660
All right, Smith, just
what the hell is going on here?

737
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,660
I already told you
everything I know.

738
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:14,780
No, you told me
Kate was shot

739
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:16,250
in the stomach.
Now we got a girl here

740
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,410
with two bullet holes
in her chest.

741
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:18,750
Now, what the fuck is going on?!

742
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,420
I don't know!
Goddamn you.

743
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,880
Sheriff.
Shut up!

744
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,890
Now, you'd better start talking

745
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,310
because
right now

746
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:29,560
you look guilty as hell to me.

747
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,940
Listen, Sheriff,

748
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,440
why would I come get you
if I did this?

749
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,360
That doesn't make any sense.

750
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,490
Well, nothing makes
any sense here, does it?

751
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:39,830
Kate and I got engaged tonight.

752
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,630
Now, I have to find her.

753
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,840
I have to find her.

754
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,600
Goddamn it.

755
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,900
Sheriff, remember,

756
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:55,860
we still got an
escaped convict

757
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,610
on the loose.

758
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:02,450
Give me
your radio.

759
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:05,790
James, are you there?

760
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:07,540
Yeah, I'm here, Sheriff.

761
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,040
All right, call County
and have them send backup

762
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,130
as soon as possible.

763
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:13,930
Then go down to the storage unit
and get those AR-15s,

764
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:16,310
and you get down here as fast
as you can, all right?

765
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,640
All right, I'm on it.
All right, listen up.

766
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,730
We're all going out front

767
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:22,530
and we're gonna wait for backup.

768
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:23,780
What about Kate and Rick?
They're still out here.

769
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,110
You wearing a badge?!

770
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,290
Where the fuck
are you going?

771
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:31,580
To find my friends.

772
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,500
I'm not just going to let her
sit out here and die.

773
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,970
What if she's dead already?

774
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:39,220
Until I see her body, I'm gonna
assume that she's alive.

775
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,850
Now, you can either
help, arrest me,

776
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,350
or you can get the
fuck out of my way.

777
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,980
Suit yourself.

778
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,030
I'm going with him.

779
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,280
Me, too.

780
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,490
Goddamn it,

781
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,370
you're not going
anywhere!

782
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:56,080
Janet,
you and Faye,

783
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,000
go to the ambulance
and stay there.

784
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,510
Jared, Walter, and I
will search for the kids.

785
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,010
Now,

786
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:04,430
you know how
to handle this?

787
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:05,980
Yeah. If anything happens,
just blow those sirens,

788
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,190
and don't forget
you have that.

789
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:09,980
Good luck,
all right.

790
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,360
Hey, Sheriff,

791
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,320
how about one of those guns?

792
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,160
He can use mine.

793
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,950
All right, let's go.

794
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,050
Kate!

795
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,180
You all right?

796
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,390
Oh, yeah,
yeah, I'm fine.

797
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,230
Insomnia-- he ain't had
a good night's sleep in years.

798
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,150
Right.

799
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:12,470
Hey.
What?

800
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,970
Stay on our six,
keep alert,

801
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:15,220
make sure
our flank is covered.

802
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,480
Huh?
Stay focused and cover our backs.

803
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,600
Oh, okay.

804
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,320
I got Barney Fife
covering our backs.

805
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,710
Oh, shit.

806
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,550
What?

807
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:38,760
Somebody let the dog out.

808
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,020
What dog?

809
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,140
Run!

810
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,690
Oh, Jesus!

811
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,080
Aah, get him off of me,
get him off of me.

812
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,460
Get him off of me, get him off.

813
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:58,170
Aah, get him off of me,
get him off of me, get him

814
00:41:58,170 --> 00:41:59,170
off of me.

815
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,480
Christ.

816
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,690
Fucking dog.

817
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:10,990
Ruined my pants.

818
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:40,450
Help me.

819
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:41,620
Sheriff, we got another one.
- Rick, Rick?

820
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,420
Jared.

821
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,250
Can you hear me, man?
Oh, Jared.

822
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:46,420
Fuck.
Hey, you're okay now, man,

823
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,920
we're gonna get you
out of here.

824
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,300
I'm sorry, man,
I didn't see him coming.

825
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,140
Who was after you?

826
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,970
He came out of nowhere.

827
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:53,060
And where's
your gun?

828
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:55,150
I don't know.
Where's Kate?

829
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,400
Man, he moved so fast.

830
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,480
I tried to shoot him...

831
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,030
Oh, fuck, I'm sorry.

832
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:01,820
Rick, Rick, where's
Kate, is she alive?

833
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,580
I don't know.
Now, he may be losing a lot of blood.

834
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,540
Let's get him to the hospital
right away, come on.

835
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:08,290
Damn it,
the ambulance.

836
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:09,460
Come on, let's go,
come on!

837
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,590
I'm gonna come
back and get you.

838
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:24,610
Would you please get that gun
out of my face?

839
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:26,200
Now...

840
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,580
I caught him, Sheriff,
he was sneaking around.

841
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,750
What's going on?

842
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:32,960
Now, easy now,

843
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,880
right, now just take it easy.

844
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,430
It's all right, Faye,
we'll take it from here.

845
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:39,810
Now, who are you and what's your name?
Take it easy.

846
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:41,810
You're gonna make me shit
on myself.

847
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:43,270
My name is Frank Jeffries.

848
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:45,440
My, my, my Uncle John--
he owns this place.

849
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,530
So you're

850
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:48,360
John Jeffries' nephew?

851
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,620
Yes, sir.

852
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:50,830
My mama is his sister Sadie.

853
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:52,950
You don't know her.

854
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:55,420
She got a big old eight-pound
goiter coming out of her neck,

855
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,460
so she don't leave
the house.

856
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:58,380
Well, what the hell
you doing here?

857
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,510
Well, the alarm here

858
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:01,180
is wired up to the house.

859
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,350
It triggered,
so I figured

860
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:05,350
I'd come down here and check it
out, that's all.

861
00:44:05,350 --> 00:44:07,650
Where's your uncle?
Why isn't he with you?

862
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:09,860
Have you met my uncle?

863
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:13,740
He's 83 and got a colostomy bag
coming out of his butt.

864
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:14,830
He ain't exactly
in the best shape

865
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:17,250
to be tracking down no burglars.

866
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:19,710
So you just got here?

867
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:21,000
Where's your car?

868
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,880
I parked it on down the road.

869
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,510
I figured if there were
any intruders,

870
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:26,430
I'd have me a much better chance
of catching 'em

871
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:28,310
if I snuck up on them.

872
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:29,930
Well, why didn't
you just call the police?

873
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:32,770
I did, and all I got was
a dang answering machine.

874
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:35,820
Now, what the hell
y'all doing down here?

875
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,530
Well, now, there's
been a murder.

876
00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:39,620
A murder?

877
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:43,370
That's right, and what
do you know about it?

878
00:44:43,370 --> 00:44:45,630
I just told you, I don't know
nothing, I just got here.

879
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:48,470
Where are the floodlights
in this place?

880
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:50,970
They're out yonder
in the back shed.

881
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:52,850
I could fire 'em up if you want.

882
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:54,440
Got me the keys right here.

883
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:55,600
Listen, you take the doctor
over to your friend.

884
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,110
Faye, you stay

885
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:58,860
with Walter
and wait for Deputy Berry.

886
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,610
All right, let's go, come on.

887
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:02,490
Come on.

888
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:09,960
You know, I'd feel
a lot more comfortable

889
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,470
if you wouldn't point
that gun at me.

890
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:12,840
Yeah, well, under
the circumstances,

891
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,050
your comfort is
none of my concern.

892
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:17,270
Shit, you think
I did this?

893
00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:18,690
I don't know what to think.

894
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:21,610
Now just keep
moving, come on.

895
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:23,610
You just be careful
with that trigger finger.

896
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,490
Damn kids.

897
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:31,040
All right, the light switch
is right in there.

898
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:36,090
Well, go on in,
turn it on.

899
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,930
By myself?

900
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:46,320
Well, it only takes one person
to turn on a light switch.

901
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,400
Yeah, well, I heard some jokes
that say differently.

902
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,610
Say,

903
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:52,200
you ain't Polish, are you?

904
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,290
Right over here in this car.

905
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:53,870
Okay, okay.

906
00:45:56,590 --> 00:46:00,050
No, no, no, what the
fuck is going on?!

907
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:00,930
You're sure
it was this car?

908
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:02,970
Rick! Yes, I am sure.

909
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:08,360
Okay, what was
that noise?

910
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:12,740
Get down and stay down.
Okay.

911
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:14,490
Keep quiet.

912
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:22,250
You sure you don't
want to go in there

913
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,630
and clear the
room first?

914
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,390
Still locked, isn't it?

915
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:29,180
Don't mean there ain't
some nut job

916
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:30,850
in there waiting to
chop my head off.

917
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,650
Hey.

918
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:39,160
All right,

919
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,960
I'm coming in there...

920
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,080
and I got myself a gun.

921
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:49,090
Can I borrow your gun?

922
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:50,720
Get the fuck in there!

923
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,270
All right, I'm going.

924
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,330
Aw, shit, all right.

925
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:29,910
And God said,
"Let there be light."

926
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,420
That's a relief, huh?

927
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,710
I'll be relieved
when this is over.

928
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,700
It's kind of hot in here.

929
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,450
You want to jump in the back?

930
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:57,210
Okay.

931
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:13,910
You all right?

932
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:15,280
Why'd they turn 'em
back off?

933
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,450
I don't know.

934
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:20,590
What the hell
was that?

935
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,840
That was weird, huh?

936
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:27,050
Stay here.

937
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:28,850
Wait, where
are you going?

938
00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:31,100
To have a smoke and find out
what the hell is going on.

939
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:33,150
You should wait for the
sheriff to come back.

940
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:35,780
Honey,
I'm a trained professional.

941
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:38,490
Don't you go worrying about me.

942
00:48:41,410 --> 00:48:43,170
Must have
blown a fuse.

943
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:46,420
The lights haven't been on
since Aunt Mamie got SARS.

944
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:48,510
Well, where is it--
the fuse box?

945
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:51,140
Over there, about
a hundred yards.

946
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:53,850
All right,
after you, come on.

947
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:01,280
Deputy?

948
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,960
You okay?

949
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:06,870
No.

950
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,040
Oh, God.

951
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,340
Oh, God.

952
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:12,680
Are you okay?

953
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:15,930
No, no!

954
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:42,140
♪

955
00:51:02,990 --> 00:51:05,660
You know, believe it or not,

956
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:07,750
this is where my mama and
my daddy conceived me.

957
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,840
Got me a blow job in
here in junior high.

958
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,800
Just keep walking.

959
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:23,530
Boy, this ain't no blown fuse.

960
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:26,740
Somebody done ripped this thing
right out the box.

961
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:27,740
Aah, boy!

962
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:28,410
Did you
see that?

963
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:33,460
I can't fix that.

964
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:38,350
Holy shit, not again.

965
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:39,470
Come on.

966
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,390
Sheriff.

967
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:03,390
Grab his legs,
I'll get him down.

968
00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:07,600
Lift him, lift him, lift him.

969
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:12,450
The cable's too tight;
get some cutters.

970
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:13,280
Get the cutters,

971
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:14,530
Janet, in my car, hurry.

972
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:17,160
Hurry up!

973
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,460
Hurry!
Hurry!

974
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:22,300
I can't find them,
they're not there.

975
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:23,470
In the backseat,

976
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:25,010
goddamn it!
Hurry!

977
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:29,100
Get 'em.

978
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:30,640
I got 'em, I got 'em.
Get his legs up.

979
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,230
Here he comes.

980
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:51,010
One, two, three, four.

981
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:53,600
Come on, breathe.

982
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,480
Seven, eight, nine, ten,

983
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,530
11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

984
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:09,880
Two, three, four.

985
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,760
Come on, breathe.

986
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,760
Seven, eight, nine, ten,

987
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,600
11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

988
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:25,200
One, two, three, four, five,

989
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,490
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

990
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:32,130
11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

991
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,400
Sorry.

992
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,360
He's dead.

993
00:53:49,070 --> 00:53:51,530
Oh, shit.

994
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:53,960
Is that Walter?

995
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,210
It is.

996
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,090
What's going on here?

997
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:02,390
Hey, Sheriff?

998
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:04,640
Where's the backup?
Why aren't they here?

999
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,100
There's a fire up at the
county line, and it's a mess,

1000
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:09,480
and no one's going
to be here for a while.

1001
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,320
Okay.

1002
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:14,320
I want you to call
in the state troopers, the FBI,

1003
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,830
the National
Guard and every

1004
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:18,080
goddamned law enforcement agency
this side

1005
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,830
of the fucking
Pacific Ocean!

1006
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:22,090
We need backup!

1007
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:24,430
Yes, sir.

1008
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:28,140
Did you bring
the guns?

1009
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:30,520
Yeah, they're in the trunk.

1010
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,440
Open it.
Right.

1011
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:38,660
Hey,
what do you think you're doing?

1012
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,790
Getting a bigger gun.

1013
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:43,790
Whosever out there has
a nine millimeter now.

1014
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:45,550
What? What are you talking about?
Deputy Riley's.

1015
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:48,260
So, what are you going to do
with the guns?

1016
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:49,720
I'm gonna hunt down
whosever doing this,

1017
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,180
and I'm going to kill him.

1018
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:52,810
Jared, you're not
in the military anymore.

1019
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:54,810
This is no search
and destroy mission.

1020
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:56,400
There are laws here
that got to be followed!

1021
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,480
With all due respect, sir,

1022
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,950
fuck the law.

1023
00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:01,660
I'm not waiting another
goddamned second

1024
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:05,330
for this sick fuck
to strike again.

1025
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:38,050
What's that noise?

1026
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:40,560
Sounds like somebody turned on
the car crusher.

1027
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,690
You don't think...

1028
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:48,570
Where is it?

1029
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:50,240
Back of the junkyard.

1030
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,410
Can I get a gun now?

1031
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:04,270
Stay calm. I'm going
to get you out of here.

1032
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:06,850
Hurry! Please, somebody!

1033
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:12,740
Okay, come on!

1034
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:15,160
How do you turn this thing off?

1035
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:18,160
Stop!

1036
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,590
Stay on the ground,
try and get on the ground!

1037
00:56:20,590 --> 00:56:23,090
Get on the ground.
Get on the ground!

1038
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:25,130
Get on the ground!

1039
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:27,050
Faye!

1040
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,100
Help! Please help me!

1041
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:31,940
Get me out of here, please.

1042
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:33,980
: Get me out.
Faye.

1043
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:35,650
Hold on.
We're gonna you out.

1044
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:37,110
Just hold on.
Please help.

1045
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:38,280
Get me out!

1046
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,530
Hurry.

1047
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:41,500
Hang on, he's coming.

1048
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:42,540
Get me out of here.
We're gonna get you out.

1049
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:44,040
Please help.
Just hold on.

1050
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,840
Get me out.
Come on.

1051
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:48,260
Hold on, hold on.
Damn it!

1052
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:49,510
Here, we got it.

1053
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:50,850
Oh, come on.
We got it.

1054
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:52,350
Come on, you're okay.

1055
00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:53,600
It's all right.
- She all right?

1056
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,440
Yeah. Okay. Come on.

1057
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,150
Come on.

1058
00:56:57,150 --> 00:56:58,610
It's all right.

1059
00:56:58,610 --> 00:56:59,650
It's all right.
You're okay.

1060
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:01,410
Faye, are you hurt?

1061
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:04,330
Did you see
who did this?

1062
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:07,330
No, I didn't see who did it.

1063
00:57:07,330 --> 00:57:09,920
What about the deputy?
Is he... is he okay?

1064
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,970
No. He's, uh... he's dead.

1065
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:15,810
Listen.
Oh, God.

1066
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:17,560
Listen, listen, do you
remember who did this?

1067
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,020
Do you remember anything
about what happened?

1068
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,690
No, I don't remember anything!

1069
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:23,740
I can't remember...

1070
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,280
I can't remember anything.
I'm sorry.

1071
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,830
All right, come on.

1072
00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:28,750
It's all right.

1073
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:41,020
Wait.

1074
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:42,850
Wait!

1075
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:44,770
I remember something.

1076
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:46,150
I remember his shoes.

1077
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:47,530
What?

1078
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:48,990
What are you talking about?

1079
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:50,450
Faye!

1080
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,480
All right, this is gonna end
right now.

1081
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,820
Where's Faye?

1082
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,320
What happened
to Faye?

1083
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,780
She didn't make it.

1084
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:16,540
What happened?

1085
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:17,830
I don't want
to talk about it.

1086
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:19,630
Where's backup?
- It's on the way.

1087
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:21,590
Sir, I just got off the horn
with County.

1088
00:58:21,590 --> 00:58:24,130
They said they found the body of the escaped convict.
What?

1089
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:26,140
They're pretty sure it's him,
but it's not confirmed yet.

1090
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:27,680
All right, I want
everybody gone.

1091
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,100
I'm not going anywhere.

1092
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:31,350
Neither am I.

1093
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:32,770
There still may be people
out there

1094
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:34,360
who need medical attention.

1095
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:35,490
And they may be dead.

1096
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:37,320
Hey! You don't know that.

1097
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,870
That's right, I don't,

1098
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:40,540
but the odds are leaning
that way, aren't they?

1099
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:42,410
Now, look,
I've just about had it,

1100
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:43,790
but I'm not going
to have any more killings,

1101
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:45,670
and backup is
on its way.

1102
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:47,470
Well, then,
I'm going to wait for them.

1103
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:48,880
Yeah, me, too.
This is not a democracy.

1104
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,720
You'll do as I say!

1105
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:51,970
Where's your flare gun?

1106
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:54,230
In the car.

1107
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:56,060
Now, listen, I'm not
gonna try to stop you,

1108
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:57,770
but I advise you very strongly
to stay here until help comes.

1109
00:58:57,770 --> 00:58:59,400
Listen, if Kate is still
alive out there,

1110
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,910
she won't be for much longer.

1111
00:59:00,910 --> 00:59:02,490
You're willing to risk
your life on that?

1112
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:05,200
I don't have a life without her.

1113
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,210
You're out there all alone.

1114
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,550
I work better alone.

1115
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:12,300
Here.

1116
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:14,390
I'll shoot this off if I find
Rick and Kate need help.

1117
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:16,220
We'll come and get you.

1118
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,190
Now, wait, you just hang on
a second.

1119
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:20,690
All right now,
I'm going to go with you.

1120
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:22,530
I can help
you find them.

1121
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:24,360
I don't need your help.

1122
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,030
Now you listen here.

1123
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:28,410
Last thing I want
to do is be a hero,

1124
00:59:28,410 --> 00:59:30,000
but the fact of
the matter is,

1125
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,170
I know this place
better than anyone here.

1126
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:34,300
I can be helpful,
we can move fast.

1127
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:36,380
You up for this?

1128
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,970
Hell, no,
but I'm going to do it anyway.

1129
00:59:38,970 --> 00:59:41,100
Now can I have a gun?

1130
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:43,810
You know how to use this?

1131
00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:45,770
Yeah, you just point it
and shoot it, right?

1132
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:48,110
Yeah, something like that.

1133
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:50,530
Let's move out.

1134
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:52,330
Backup arrives,
I'll hit the sirens.

1135
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,760
That's one brave kid.

1136
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,930
More like stupid.

1137
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:04,890
Shit. Shit.

1138
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:11,820
What branch
of the military were you in?

1139
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:13,570
Please don't say
the Coast Guard.

1140
01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:15,450
Army.

1141
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:16,910
How long were you in for?

1142
01:00:16,910 --> 01:00:18,210
Three years.

1143
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:19,630
Why-why such a...?

1144
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:21,670
Got shot in the leg,
medical discharge.

1145
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:26,930
Golden ticket, huh?

1146
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:28,890
Not really.

1147
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:32,230
Shit!

1148
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:35,400
You like being
an army grunt?

1149
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:37,610
Actually, I
was a Ranger.

1150
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:39,200
We got treated a
little bit differently.

1151
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:44,420
A Ranger.
Oh, shit.

1152
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:49,970
A Ranger,
huh? Shit.

1153
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:52,010
I'm starting to feel
a lot safer already.

1154
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:55,520
Yeah? Well, as soon as
you start feeling safe,

1155
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,360
that's about the time
when you got shot.

1156
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,200
I wouldn't light
that if I were you.

1157
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,570
Why?

1158
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:04,330
'Cause it might
give away our position?

1159
01:01:04,330 --> 01:01:06,460
No.

1160
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:11,380
Lung cancer.

1161
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:13,300
These flashlights will
give away our position.

1162
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:19,980
Hey, wait up!

1163
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,440
Hey, where did you go?

1164
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:22,530
Ow!

1165
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:26,530
All right, stay on my back,

1166
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:27,370
make sure
we're covered from behind.

1167
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:35,630
Do you hear that?

1168
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:37,800
Don't move.

1169
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,150
Holy shit.
Run!

1170
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:47,570
Oh, shit, oh, shit.

1171
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:49,360
I think
we're getting shot at.

1172
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:50,700
Should I shoot? Should I shoot?
Where should I shoot?

1173
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:52,370
Hey, hey, hey,
relax, relax.

1174
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:54,040
Relax...
I need you to stay calm.

1175
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:55,420
Relax? Are you friggin' crazy?

1176
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:56,790
I'm in a friggin' gunfight.

1177
01:01:56,790 --> 01:01:59,050
I'm scared.

1178
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:00,930
Ow! Shit!
Yeah, and you're shot.

1179
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:02,720
What?

1180
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:03,970
Oh, shit, I've been shot.

1181
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,560
Shoot the flare!

1182
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,600
Shoot the flare!
Shoot the flare!

1183
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:08,940
Hey, hey, hey.
It's just a graze.

1184
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:10,780
What the hell
does that mean?

1185
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:12,610
It means you'll live.

1186
01:02:12,610 --> 01:02:13,990
Oh, I don't know. I
feel cold and weak.

1187
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:16,410
Hey, listen, I need
to cover his flank,

1188
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:18,080
but I need you
to lay down suppression fire

1189
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,580
until I'm clear.

1190
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:21,210
You got that?

1191
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:22,380
What the hell
does that mean?

1192
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:24,340
It means you take this gun,

1193
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:27,140
you shoot that way
until I'm clear, okay?

1194
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:30,390
On three. Ready?

1195
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:32,520
One. Wait, now,
hang on a second.

1196
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:35,150
"One, two, three, go,"
or just "One, two, three"?

1197
01:02:35,150 --> 01:02:38,660
Three. On three.

1198
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:40,700
Just don't shoot me.

1199
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:45,090
Fuck. One, two, three.

1200
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:46,510
Shit.

1201
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:32,420
Fuck!

1202
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:35,800
Looks like Jared found
what he was looking for.

1203
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:38,380
I just hope
it's not the other way around.

1204
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:41,970
Fuck!

1205
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:49,170
Hey, I think I found him!

1206
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:51,040
I think I found him.
Come here, hurry.

1207
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,460
He's bleeding.

1208
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:56,300
Rick? Hey, man,
can you hear me?

1209
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:57,600
Jared.

1210
01:04:01,010 --> 01:04:02,540
Hang on, buddy. We're going
to get you out of here.

1211
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,510
Fuck!

1212
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:13,430
Shit. You need a signal?

1213
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:16,340
Rick. Hey.

1214
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:18,900
Hey, where is Kate?

1215
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,030
Rick, where's Kate?

1216
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:21,950
Can you tell me
where Kate is?

1217
01:04:24,330 --> 01:04:28,790
Fire in the hole!

1218
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:33,430
Let's go.

1219
01:04:40,770 --> 01:04:42,900
Deputy Berry will take you
to the hospital.

1220
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:46,450
Wait. What about
your girl?

1221
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:48,410
No, the sheriff's right.

1222
01:04:48,410 --> 01:04:51,290
You should go.

1223
01:04:51,290 --> 01:04:53,210
Sorry.

1224
01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:02,310
If you want to go
back in there

1225
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:04,360
and hunt down that son
of a bitch, I'm with you.

1226
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:09,610
Somebody help me!

1227
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:13,370
Who's there?

1228
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:16,540
I found this girl
on the side of the road.

1229
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:18,250
She needs help.

1230
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:20,420
Freeze! Stay right
where you are.

1231
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:22,510
Don't take another step.
Somebody needs to help this girl.

1232
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:24,930
Don't you move,
not another fucking inch.

1233
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:27,190
Whoa, whoa, whoa, don't shoot.
This girl's hurt really bad.

1234
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:28,940
She needs medical help.

1235
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:33,320
Kate?! Put the girl
on the ground

1236
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:35,580
and back the fuck away!
Easy, man.

1237
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:37,790
Back the fuck away from her!

1238
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:40,670
Put her slowly on the
ground, keep your hands

1239
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:41,500
where I can see 'em,
don't make any

1240
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,880
sudden moves.

1241
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:46,890
Wait a sec.

1242
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:49,140
I didn't do this.

1243
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:51,190
What the hell you doing out here?
I was just taking a walk.

1244
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:52,810
I found her
about a half mile up the road.

1245
01:05:52,810 --> 01:05:54,360
I heard your sirens, so,

1246
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:56,150
I carried her here.
What's your name?

1247
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:58,160
Peter Dobbs.

1248
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,830
Look, I'm just passing
through town for the night.

1249
01:06:00,830 --> 01:06:02,870
I'm staying in the Motel 6
for the night, room 308.

1250
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:04,710
Call and ask them
if you want.

1251
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:06,460
Sheriff, we need to get her
to a hospital right away.

1252
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:08,260
Put her in my car.

1253
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:10,930
You-- you're coming with us.

1254
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:13,100
What?

1255
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:14,430
I don't want any trouble.

1256
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:16,020
Just get in the
fucking car.

1257
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:17,860
Don't say a
word, come on.

1258
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:23,370
Tell Janet we're on our way.

1259
01:06:23,370 --> 01:06:25,080
We have Kate.

1260
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:27,330
She's unconscious,
she's lost a lot of blood.

1261
01:06:27,330 --> 01:06:29,380
Be waiting for us
in front of the hospital.

1262
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:30,840
Roger that, Sheriff.

1263
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:32,930
Uh, listen, the ID
on the prisoner that escaped--

1264
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:34,090
it doesn't match.

1265
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:35,680
Prisoner is still at large.

1266
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,060
Come again?

1267
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:40,350
Prisoner is still at large.

1268
01:06:46,490 --> 01:06:47,740
It's him! It's him!

1269
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:49,830
Get that son of a bitch!

1270
01:06:49,830 --> 01:06:51,210
Get that motherfucker!

1271
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:21,430
I don't want to fight you.

1272
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:23,300
You don't
have a choice.

1273
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:25,430
Please.

1274
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:27,020
Please.

1275
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:28,770
I can't go back there.

1276
01:07:28,770 --> 01:07:30,570
I can't go back to prison.

1277
01:07:30,570 --> 01:07:32,030
Please, I can't go back.

1278
01:07:32,030 --> 01:07:33,320
The only place
you're going is hell.

1279
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:48,810
Why did you kill my friends?

1280
01:07:48,810 --> 01:07:50,600
Why did you kill them?!

1281
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,900
Your friends?

1282
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:53,270
I didn't kill your friends.

1283
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:54,820
I never killed anyone.
Bullshit!

1284
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:56,820
I'm a dead man.

1285
01:07:56,820 --> 01:07:59,490
Why would I lie?

1286
01:07:59,490 --> 01:08:00,620
'Cause you're fucking sick.

1287
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:02,830
Why did I bring
back the girl?

1288
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:06,210
You're a fucking liar.

1289
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:48,410
Is he dead?

1290
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:11,120
Oh, I... yeah, I wish
I could remember.

1291
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:13,580
You know, it's all
just such a blur.

1292
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:15,710
Yeah, well, you don't have
to worry about that anymore.

1293
01:09:15,710 --> 01:09:18,210
Why, did you kill him?

1294
01:09:18,210 --> 01:09:20,590
Yeah.

1295
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:25,020
Always got to be the damn hero.

1296
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:32,240
You know what I can't
get out of my mind?

1297
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:33,820
Uh-uh.

1298
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:35,830
Is right
before he died,

1299
01:09:35,830 --> 01:09:37,540
he said he never
killed anyone before.

1300
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:39,120
Oh, yeah, right.

1301
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,840
He was innocent.

1302
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:45,180
Yeah, the fucked up
thing is, I believed him.

1303
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:49,350
Why didn't he kill Kate,
or you for that matter?

1304
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:51,480
Hey, man,
it's not like he didn't try.

1305
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:53,570
Okay, you can't try
and figure out people like that.

1306
01:09:53,570 --> 01:09:55,440
Okay, he's insane.

1307
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:58,910
He's a textbook lunatic.

1308
01:09:58,910 --> 01:10:00,740
Hey, how is Kate?
How did surgery go?

1309
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:02,790
She's good, man.
She's good. Good.

1310
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:05,170
Yeah, doctor said
she's going to be fine.

1311
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:06,500
Good.

1312
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:10,180
Hey... Jared.

1313
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:12,640
I'm sorry.

1314
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:16,610
Just... Just about everything.

1315
01:10:30,210 --> 01:10:32,090

01:10:32,090 --> 01:10:33,430
Fuck you. Fuck you.

1317
01:10:37,390 --> 01:10:39,020

1318
01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:46,110

1320
01:10:47,530 --> 01:10:49,540
You fucking asshole!

1321
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:51,080
I can't believe you just
fucking did that.

1322
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,250
What the fuck's your problem?
Hey, shut up!

1323
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:55,260
- I didn't mean to, Jessica.
- If she dies,

1324
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:57,380
you're going to jail,
you fucking motherfucker!

1325
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:59,220
Hey, you're fucking hurting her!
Jesus fucking Christ!

1326
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:01,850
Fuck you, you fucking... Shut up.
We got to keep her calm.

1327
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:03,560

01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:05,400

01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:34,530
Oh, fuck!

1340
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:36,990
What did I fucking do?!

1341
01:11:36,990 --> 01:11:39,040
Fuck!

1342
01:11:46,930 --> 01:11:49,020
Kate?

1343
01:11:51,730 --> 01:11:53,820
Kate?!

1344
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:58,030
Hey, where are you, Kate?

1345
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:03,790
Fuck!

1346
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:07,300
Hey, Kate,
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1347
01:12:10,890 --> 01:12:12,470
Fuck.

1348
01:12:12,470 --> 01:12:14,850
Hey, Kate!

1349
01:12:14,850 --> 01:12:16,860
Where the fuck did you go?

1350
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,950
No! No! No!

1351
01:12:21,950 --> 01:12:23,830
No! Are you okay?
Hey, hey, hey.

1352
01:12:23,830 --> 01:12:25,540
Hey, hey, it's me.
It's me.

1353
01:12:25,540 --> 01:12:28,460
You're okay.
Oh, my God.

1354
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:30,550
I had the worst dream.
Rick was in it.

1355
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:33,340
Me?
It was so real.

1356
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:35,010
It's okay.
It was just a dream.

1357
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:36,350
Look at me.
It was just a dream.

1358
01:12:36,350 --> 01:12:38,680
What were you dreaming?

1359
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:40,100
That...

1360
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:41,820
That you shot Jessica.

1361
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:44,150
What?

1362
01:12:44,150 --> 01:12:46,820
It was so real, I...
I screamed when he walked in.

1363
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:49,370
I'm sorry.
It's okay.

1364
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:51,500
Yeah, and I also stabbed the
deputy and hung him on a truck.

1365
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,040
Want me to get you
something to drink?

1366

Yeah. Yeah.

1368
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:00,640
Okay.

1369
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:21,380
It's funny
you dreamt that, Kate.

1370
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:23,800
Why?

1371
01:13:26,850 --> 01:13:28,860
Because it wasn't a dream.

1372
