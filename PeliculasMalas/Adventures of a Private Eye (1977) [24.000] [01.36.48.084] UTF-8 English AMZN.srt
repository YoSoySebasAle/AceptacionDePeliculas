1
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:19,500
Wake up.

2
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:34,208
Morning, Mr. Prentiss. You're up early.

3
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:36,875
Up early? I'm on nights this week.

4
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:49,375
<i>I'm losing sleep
'cause I've got to keep an eye on you</i>

5
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:55,791
<i>You cannot be trusted for one night</i>

6
00:02:56,666 --> 00:03:01,208
<i>You're at home but you're not alone
I know that's true</i>

7
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,625
<i>I got information from</i>

8
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,916
<i>Information from my private eye</i>

9
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,791
<i>I can't mention names
but I heard that the games</i>

10
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,875
<i>have been going on</i>

11
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:22,250
<i>You've been double-dealing
left and right</i>

12
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,541
<i>And it hurts me so
but I've got to know</i>

13
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:27,208
<i>Be it right or wrong</i>

14
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,500
<i>All that information from</i>

15
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:36,500
<i>Information from my private eye</i>

16
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:40,083
<i>My private eye</i>

17
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:43,250
<i>Gonna keep tabs
Gonna tell a story</i>

18
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,958
<i>My private eye</i>

19
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,708
<i>Always checking up on you</i>

20
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:51,916
<i>Oh, my private eye</i>

21
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:55,291
<i>Got a lot of friends
Gonna tell a story</i>

22
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,833
<i>Calling all cars
It's a quarter to three</i>

23
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,625
<i>There's nobody home and it's worrying me</i>

24
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:05,666
<i>It goes without saying
that she's only playing with me</i>

25
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:26,750
It's true, you know.
Crime is on the increase.

26
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:30,291
Certainly too much for
the police to handle.

27
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:32,750
That's where people like us come in.

28
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,125
Oh, I'm Bob West, by the way.
Private Detective.

29
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:38,083
Excuse me. Can you tell me
where Flash Street is, please?

30
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:40,875
Yeah, you go through
the first set of traffic lights,

31
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,083
to the second set and then you turn left.

32
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:45,583
- Thanks, mate.
- All right.

33
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:49,041
You see, the trouble with most people
today is they're not observant.

34
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:51,083
They walk around with their eyes closed,

35
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,375
and that's just what
the criminal type's looking for.

36
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:00,375
This is where I work.

37
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:03,291
If ever there was a glamorous job,
this has got to be it.

38
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,541
Fast cars, private yachts.

39
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:09,208
Flying off to assignments
in exotic places. Fantastic.

40
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,875
Not that I do any of that, but the bloke
I work for, he does it all the time.

41
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,958
And, of course, need I say it? Women.

42
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:31,958
You know, I have never known a fellow
cram so many beautiful women into one day.

43
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:35,375
My boss goes through secretaries
like a chain-smoker.

44
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:38,041
This one only started this morning.

45
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:45,583
Amateur. Peering through keyholes
is for the amateur.

46
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:46,916
I wasn't actually, Mr. Blake.

47
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,750
I just thought I'd dropped
something on the floor.

48
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:52,208
- Bugging. Now that's the professional way.
- Bugging.

49
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,208
Yes. And like everything else,
purely a matter of technique.

50
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:59,583
Now you stick with me, and you'll soon
learn to be a successful bugger.

51
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:07,666
Hurry up, Miss Walker.
I want to be out of here in five minutes.

52
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,083
Case, Robert, case.

53
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:18,666
You mean you want me to handle one
while you're away, Mr. Blake?

54
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,833
No, I want you to hand me one now.

55
00:06:21,916 --> 00:06:23,375
- My briefcase.
- Oh.

56
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,750
I trust I'm doing the right thing,

57
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:26,791
leaving you in charge
of this office while I'm away.

58
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,416
I'll handle things while you're away,
Mr. Blake. Don't worry about that.

59
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,333
Watch it! That's just it,
I don't want you to handle things.

60
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:35,083
Just keep an eye on the place.
That will be quite sufficient.

61
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,375
Well...

62
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,833
Is there nothing I can do
while you're away?

63
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,958
I mean, finish off a case or something?

64
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:45,541
To work on even the simplest of cases
requires a vast reservoir of experience.

65
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,291
I've been here three months.

66
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,666
I'm talking of years, Robert, years.

67
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:53,041
You haven't even asked me
to follow anybody yet.

68
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,833
I shall be gone for about four days.

69
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,041
Any problems, you know where to
contact me. Hotel Majestic, Beirut.

70
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:03,791
By the way, I've arranged for a temporary
secretary to deputise for Miss Walker.

71
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:06,916
She should have been here
first thing this morning, but she's late.

72
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,125
- Right, Miss Walker.
- Don't worry about a thing, Mr. Blake.

73
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,208
I'll make sure
everything's running smoothly for you.

74
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,083
Look, just take the messages, that's all.

75
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,541
Don't start messing in things
which don't concern you.

76
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,583
No, I wouldn't dream of it.

77
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,250
Come on.

78
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,750
Have a nice time.

79
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:43,750
Hello.

80
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,041
That'll be the new secretary, I bet.

81
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,125
Oh, I can just see her now.

82
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:58,666
Soft blonde hair,
lovely slender little body,

83
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,625
deep, sensitive eyes.

84
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,125
Gubbidge. Maud Gubbidge.
I'm the new secretary from Rent-A-Temp.

85
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,666
Rent-a-what?

86
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,708
There must be a mistake. I mean...

87
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,208
This is the Blake Detective Agency,
isn't it?

88
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:18,083
I was told to report to a Mr. West.
Is that you?

89
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,416
Well, yeah, but I was expecting
somebody a bit...

90
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,416
- Older?
- Well...

91
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,291
Now the last boss I had,
he kept making improper suggestions to me.

92
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,125
I hope you're not going to be like that.

93
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:31,875
- Like what?
- Keep making improper suggestions.

94
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:33,916
Oh, no way.

95
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,625
Good. As long as the only thing I have
to take down is shorthand, I don't mind.

96
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,750
You see, it was my body
that was the trouble.

97
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,125
- Yeah, I can see that.
- He couldn't keep his hands off it.

98
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,333
Really?

99
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:49,333
It got so bad, it was just unbearable,
so I had to hand in my notice.

100
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,000
He said I aroused his primeval impulse.

101
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,125
I seem to have that effect on men,
you know.

102
00:08:55,208 --> 00:09:00,125
Well, if you wouldn't mind
answering the door, please, Miss, er...

103
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,250
Gubbidge. Maud Gubbidge.

104
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:10,333
- Yes, what do you want?
- Blake Detective Agency?

105
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,875
- That'll be all right, Miss Garbage.
- Gubbidge.

106
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,791
- Yes, yes. If you'd like to step this way.
- Mr. Judd Blake?

107
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,166
Well...

108
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,083
- Laura Sutton.
- How do you do?

109
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,083
Mr. Blake,
I'll come straight to the point.

110
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,500
I want you to handle a case
for me immediately.

111
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:36,375
- Oh, yes. But I'm not...
- No, no, no. I'll explain.

112
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:39,541
You see, I used to be
a professional model.

113
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:44,291
And to be quite honest,
I led a rather wild life.

114
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,125
That is, until I met Ashley.

115
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:51,958
Ashley Dotrice.
Then it was love at first sight.

116
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,833
The fact that he was 87,

117
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,250
a multi-millionaire
with a bad heart condition,

118
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:58,250
had nothing to do with it, naturally.

119
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:59,625
Naturally.
But, you see, the thing is, I'm not...

120
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,833
And last week,
we were supposed to be married,

121
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:05,041
but I thought it best
we didn't have a long engagement.

122
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:08,791
I mean, he'd already had
three heart attacks since last Christmas.

123
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:12,916
- Last week, he had a fourth and died.
- Oh, I'm very sorry.

124
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,875
Hmm? Oh, yes, of course,
I was terribly upset.

125
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:21,541
Now the point is that I'm due to inherit
his entire estate on the 25th.

126
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:25,958
- That's very nice, but the thing is...
- Yes, but you see the trouble is Ashley.

127
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:30,250
Darling Ashley. You see, he was under the
impression that I was still virgin.

128
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,291
Oh, really?

129
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,541
Really?

130
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:39,291
According to the terms of the will,
I only inherit everything

131
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:42,958
if I've done nothing to bring
the family name into disrepute.

132
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,791
So, you see, I have a problem.

133
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:48,583
- Problem?
- Well...

134
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:52,000
I have a number of explicit photographs
of myself

135
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,416
with a gentleman in...

136
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,291
A compromising situation.

137
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,500
- Oh!
- I would like you to see them.

138
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:02,625
- Oh, yeah. I'd love to, yeah.
- I feel I should explain...

139
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,500
Well, just pass them over
and let me have a look.

140
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:09,166
You see, they came through the post
yesterday morning.

141
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,041
Yes, well,
I think I should take a look and...

142
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,708
They came with a note
threatening to send them

143
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,666
to Ashley's solicitor unless I pay 50,000.

144
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,333
Yes, well, I can see
you've got a problem there,

145
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:21,250
but if I could just have a look at them...

146
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:25,333
Mr. Blake, I'm at my wits' end.

147
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,541
Oh, come on. They can't be that bad.

148
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:40,125
- Wow.
- Exactly!

149
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:45,208
Needless to say,
I don't have that kind of money.

150
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,958
- What?
- I said I don't have that kind of money.

151
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,916
I can't touch any of the estate
until I inherit it on the 25th.

152
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,416
And if I ask for some kind of a loan,
then somebody might get suspicious.

153
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,041
You know, you photograph very well.

154
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,125
Thank you.

155
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:07,083
What I want you to do is to catch
the blackmailer and get me the negatives.

156
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:09,416
It's incredible definition as well.

157
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,958
You do see the position I'm in?

158
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:13,833
You're in a very awkward position,
I can see that.

159
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:17,458
Mr. Blake, what do you think?

160
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,791
Oh, I think they're great.

161
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:22,083
Especially the one
with the stick of rock...

162
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,625
Yes, well, um...

163
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:30,583
I think I should be able to fit you in,
in between commitments.

164
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,041
Who do you reckon it is?

165
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:36,000
If I knew who it was, I wouldn't be here
employing you, Mr. Blake.

166
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,791
Yes, quite.

167
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,541
Just testing you, that's all.

168
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:44,250
Well, I think I'll kick off by
following up a few leads.

169
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,458
Leads?

170
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,000
Yes. You don't happen to have any, do you?

171
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,000
- Scott.
- Who?

172
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,750
The person on the picture.

173
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,458
Oh, yes, I hadn't noticed him.

174
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,875
He's a photographer.

175
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,041
It could have been a set-up job, but...

176
00:13:00,125 --> 00:13:01,375
Yes, well.

177
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:03,041
You know, I don't think
this is going to be

178
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,458
a particularly difficult
case to solve, Miss...

179
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,333
Sutton.

180
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:12,041
Just leave it with me for a few days.

181
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,583
Everything will be all right.

182
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:19,208
Oh, don't worry.
They'll be safely under lock and key.

183
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:22,666
Everything is kept strictly confidential
in this business.

184
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:29,625
You're out of your head.
How can you take on a job like this?

185
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,458
Amazing what you can do
with a garlic sausage.

186
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:34,083
It's an open-and-shut case.
There's absolutely nothing to it.

187
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:38,291
- Anyway, it's a cucumber, isn't it?
- Nothing to it?

188
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,833
You don't know the first thing
about being a private detective.

189
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,000
It's definitely a sausage.

190
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,083
I've seen the way Blake does it.
It's dead easy.

191
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:46,583
It's just plain common sense.
Nothing more.

192
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,250
I'll get these.

193
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:53,250
It's all right, Bob, I'll get them.

194
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,541
Anyway, I've got ambition, haven't I?

195
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:59,250
If I hadn't, I'd probably still be stuck
in that boring old insurance office.

196
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:02,416
Might be all right for you,
Derek, but me...

197
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,166
I'm going places.

198
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:09,000
I still say you're trying to run
before you can walk. Like you always do.

199
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:12,000
That bicycle pump must have been painful.

200
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,833
Anyway, what about her thinking
you're Blake? That is fraud.

201
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:18,291
Yeah, well, I'll tell her afterwards,
when it's all over.

202
00:14:18,375 --> 00:14:20,833
All right, Sherlock,
what's your first move?

203
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:24,083
First, I'm going to check out
this photographer guy.

204
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:27,083
Do you know, I think
he's hiding the negatives at his flat.

205
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,625
And what are you going to do?

206
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,833
Knock on the door and say,
"Excuse me, I'm a private detective.

207
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:32,041
"I think you're blackmailing my client.

208
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,583
"Please, may I come in
and search the place?"

209
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:37,458
Very funny. No, I'm going to
go to that flat in disguise...

210
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:53,000
- Mr. Radleigh?
- Mr. Radleigh's out at the moment.

211
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:57,208
Well, I'm from the Health Department,
Rodent and Pest Control.

212
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,083
I've come to have a look at your mice.

213
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,791
- Mice? I haven't seen any mice.
- Oh.

214
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:04,958
Well, anyway,
I can't hang about here all day.

215
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:08,708
I mean, I've got a schedule to keep to
and I've got to do the whole area.

216
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,083
Well, I suppose it will be all right.

217
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:30,291
I do hope you're not going to make a mess.
I have just done in here, you know.

218
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:35,458
No, I'll just hunt around for any little
signs and then lay a few traps.

219
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:36,625
Oh.

220
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:45,208
You don't do ants, do you?

221
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,250
- What?
- Ants.

222
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:52,875
Oh, yeah, we do them all.
Ants, mice, rats, cockroaches, weevils.

223
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:55,833
Only where I live,
they come in from the garden.

224
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,708
Harry, that's my husband,

225
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:01,208
he found a couple
in his cornflakes the other morning

226
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:05,791
I mean, there they were, just swimming
around as though they own the place.

227
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,916
Ant powder, that's what you need.

228
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,208
You can't put that in cornflakes, can you?

229
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:15,000
I don't suppose you'll find any in there.

230
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:18,958
Well, you never know.
I mean, they eat all sorts, you know.

231
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,458
Clothes, woodwork, paper...

232
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,833
Photographs.

233
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,916
You, uh...

234
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,166
You haven't got any photographs

235
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,250
lying around, have you? Or negatives?

236
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:35,541
- They love negatives, you know.
- I wouldn't know about that.

237
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:39,250
I'm just the home help.
You'd have to ask Mr. Radleigh.

238
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:45,625
Oh, I was just making myself
a nice cup of tea.

239
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,041
I don't suppose you'd fancy one?

240
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,916
That's very kind. Thank you very much.

241
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:32,583
What are you doing down there?

242
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:35,083
Just looking for droppings.

243
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:39,916
Well, you won't find any of those.
I've only just hoovered.

244
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,375
- Do you take sugar?
- No, thanks.

245
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:56,500
Oh, yes. Well, I'm always finding things
like that about the place.

246
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,666
He has women here, you know.

247
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:05,000
I don't mind the black ones so much.
It's the big red ones I can't stand.

248
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,500
- What?
- Ants.

249
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:10,875
Oh, ants.

250
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:14,750
My Harry found a couple in his bed
the other night.

251
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:18,375
Gave him a terrible fright.
He thought it was crabs.

252
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:23,166
Mind you, he is a funny man.

253
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:26,708
He always did attract
nasty, creepy crawly things.

254
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,500
- Oh, my God, he's back already.
- What?

255
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:33,875
Quick, clear these things up.

256
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:47,583
Oh, Mr. Radleigh,
you did give me a surprise!

257
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,833
I was just finishing off.

258
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,500
Who's he?

259
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:53,958
Well, I hope I did right, Mr. Radleigh.

260
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:56,541
This gentleman is from the government.

261
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,958
- From?
- Pest Control.

262
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,541
Oh, yes. What are you? A free sample?

263
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,750
He says he's come about the mice.

264
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,041
He's come about the...

265
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,958
- What mice?
- Well, I'm investigating the...

266
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:12,291
We haven't got any around here, so go
and do your investigating somewhere else.

267
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:13,500
Goodbye.

268
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:16,166
Where the bloody hell's my camera?

269
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,916
Mrs. Horne, have you moved it?
Because I put it over there.

270
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,125
Oh, yes. I do remember seeing it.

271
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:26,416
"Oh, yes. I do remember seeing it."

272
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,916
Well, don't look at me.
I'm only the cleaner.

273
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:45,833
- What do you want to borrow them for?
- I'm going to spy on him.

274
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,250
What are you trying to do?
Get yourself arrested?

275
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,833
What I should have done was bug the place.
I mean, it's definitely him.

276
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:55,833
Nasty type.
A blackmailer if ever I saw one.

277
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,958
Did you get the negatives?

278
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:01,291
No, but I found a camera.

279
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:06,541
That proves it. You twit!
What's that got to do with it?

280
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:08,041
I've got a camera.
Everybody's got a camera.

281
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,583
Yeah, but not like this one.
It had a big lens on it.

282
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,583
Well, it would do, wouldn't it?
He's a photographer.

283
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:14,458
Precisely!

284
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,625
Why don't you just admit
you haven't got the faintest idea

285
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,333
about what you're doing
and let's all get some rest.

286
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:21,250
When I've nearly solved the case?

287
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,291
Anyway, look, it's time I was going.

288
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:29,125
Look, Derek, believe it or not,
I do know what I'm doing.

289
00:21:19,958 --> 00:21:21,666
Emergency. Which service do you require?

290
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,875
Police.

291
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:06,166
I hope you don't think I do this
with every photographer I work with.

292
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,666
No, of course not.

293
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:35,958
- Well, I can't see anyone.
- He must have gone.

294
00:22:36,041 --> 00:22:40,500
Only there was definitely someone outside
prowling about in the bushes.

295
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:44,958
Now, now, Miss Friggin. That makes three
you say you've seen in the past week.

296
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:47,416
They can't all have been sex maniacs,
can they?

297
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,583
Oh, I don't agree.
There are a lot of them about, you know.

298
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:53,166
You've really no cause for alarm.

299
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:57,750
A lot of them go for older women now.
It said so in the papers.

300
00:22:57,833 --> 00:23:00,125
Well, don't you worry about it,
Miss Friggin.

301
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:03,125
Anyone tries to molest you,
we are only around the corner.

302
00:23:03,208 --> 00:23:06,625
Well, anyway, I always look under my bed,
just to make sure.

303
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:10,125
- But there's never anybody there.
- That's right. You keep doing that.

304
00:23:10,208 --> 00:23:14,250
And I always wear a wedding ring
whenever I go out.

305
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:20,333
It's where they hang about, you know,
behind those bushes.

306
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,833
- Scott.
- Mmm?

307
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:37,083
What's this?
It feels like a lump of cheese.

308
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,750
What?

309
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,625
God knows. Where were we?

310
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:05,166
Oi! You down there.
Police. Hold it! Hey!

311
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:31,666
Hello, love. How did it go last night?

312
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,625
Terrific.

313
00:24:33,708 --> 00:24:35,166
Like my new outfit?

314
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:39,583
I couldn't resist it.
Well, it's terribly me. Don't you think?

315
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:42,458
Yeah, it's terrible.

316
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:44,541
Oh, that woman...

317
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:47,583
- Miss Sutton phoned up for you.
- Oh, yeah?

318
00:24:47,666 --> 00:24:51,083
Now, personally, I never liked the look
of her, the minute I clapped eyes on her.

319
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:52,291
What did she want?

320
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:54,583
I suppose some men
might find her attractive,

321
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:56,375
but it's only the way
she's done her make-up.

322
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:57,833
Yes, all right. What did she want?

323
00:24:57,916 --> 00:25:00,666
Of course, I don't need any of that,
you understand,

324
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,208
not with my basic primitive sexuality.

325
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:04,583
Never mind all that.

326
00:25:04,666 --> 00:25:07,666
Mind you, a lot of it is to do
with the way you dress.

327
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:11,000
- Look, Miss Cribbage.
- Gubbidge, but you can call me Maud.

328
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:13,041
Are you going to tell me
what she wanted or not?

329
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:16,791
She wants you to go and stay with her.

330
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:18,833
- She what?
- That's what she said.

331
00:25:18,916 --> 00:25:21,500
She wants you to catch a train
first thing tomorrow morning

332
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:23,833
and go down and stay with her
in the country.

333
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:25,791
Oh. Great.

334
00:25:45,083 --> 00:25:47,416
- Hello there.
- Hello, Mr. Blake.

335
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:56,041
I suppose you are wondering
why I asked you down here.

336
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:58,416
I think I can guess, Laura.

337
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,125
Obviously, it mustn't appear
as if we're having an affair.

338
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:02,916
Oh, I'll be very discreet, don't worry.

339
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,708
The slightest hint of a scandal,
and I'd lose everything.

340
00:26:06,791 --> 00:26:09,583
There's absolutely no need
for anybody to find out.

341
00:26:09,666 --> 00:26:10,750
Well, I have paved the way.

342
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:13,416
I've said you're an old friend
just down for a few days.

343
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,916
Good idea. Very good idea.

344
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:18,416
Er, told who?

345
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,666
Well, Ashley's relatives, of course.
They came down for the funeral.

346
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,333
All key suspects obviously, huh?

347
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:27,958
They think that the estate should have
gone to his daughters, Violet and Medea.

348
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:29,500
There you have your motive.

349
00:26:29,583 --> 00:26:33,208
And then, of course,
there's Violet's husband, Sydney,

350
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,458
and her stepdaughter, Clarissa.

351
00:26:35,541 --> 00:26:39,041
Mmm.
Well, I'll soon have that lot sorted out.

352
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:43,333
What you will find interesting is that
Scott arrived late last night

353
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:44,958
and he's staying in the town.

354
00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:47,166
Really? That is interesting.

355
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,000
Very interesting.

356
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:52,333
Hmm. Right then. Let's go, shall we?

357
00:26:52,416 --> 00:26:54,875
Oh, by the way, where are we going?

358
00:26:54,958 --> 00:26:56,791
Ashley's estate.

359
00:26:56,875 --> 00:27:00,750
Oh, I'd rather thought we'd have
booked into some little hotel,

360
00:27:00,833 --> 00:27:02,291
just the two of us.

361
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:04,291
Whatever for?

362
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:06,583
Well...

363
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,500
Oh, Ashley's estate, Grimsdyke Manor.

364
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:12,708
Grimsdyke Manor.

365
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,875
Craddock, this is Mr. Blake.

366
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:26,750
Would you take his things
to the west wing, please?

367
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:28,958
Certainly, madam.

368
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:32,750
Your coat, sir.

369
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:36,250
- Pardon?
- Your coat, sir.

370
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:37,458
Oh.

371
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:41,541
Thank you.

372
00:27:43,458 --> 00:27:46,416
Medea Dotrice, Judd Blake.

373
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,708
I see the mark of death on you.

374
00:27:48,791 --> 00:27:50,625
Judd's just staying for a few days.

375
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:53,875
Yes, I can sense
he won't be with us for very long.

376
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:56,416
I have the second sight.

377
00:27:59,625 --> 00:28:02,625
Would you like some breakfast? Breakfast?

378
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:07,125
I expect you'll be hungry
after your journey.

379
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:09,500
Oh, yes. Thanks very much.

380
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:11,958
- Not there.
- Over here.

381
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:21,000
This is Violet, Medea's sister.

382
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:23,208
Pleased to meet you.

383
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:30,291
Nothing passes between my lips
unless it's organic.

384
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,208
Violet's a vegetarian.

385
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:36,333
I notice you didn't introduce your friend
to me, Laura.

386
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:40,041
Vi's my stepmother. I'm Clarissa.

387
00:28:40,125 --> 00:28:41,333
Hello.

388
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:49,333
Pig's flesh and the embryo
of an unborn chicken.

389
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:53,791
- I beg your pardon?
- On your plate.

390
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:56,375
It's not good for you, you know.

391
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:59,875
Oh... The tea leaves.

392
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:03,000
I see nothing ahead but misery,

393
00:29:03,083 --> 00:29:06,500
torment and blood.

394
00:29:07,541 --> 00:29:09,666
Morning, morning, morning.

395
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,916
Ah, breakfast.

396
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,500
The morning is bright,
so don't look so glum,

397
00:29:17,583 --> 00:29:20,875
'cause if you do, I shall smack your bum.

398
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,416
Must you be so crude
first thing in the morning?

399
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,416
You've no sense of humor, Vi.
I've told you that before.

400
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:35,500
Sense of humor? Here? Knowing that... Oh!

401
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:38,791
Let me introduce you.
Judd Blake, Sydney Burke.

402
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,166
Ah, yes. Yes.

403
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:47,875
Would you like some vitamin
and iron tablets?

404
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:51,708
- Very good for you, you know.
- No, thanks.

405
00:29:55,625 --> 00:29:57,083
I've weak blood, you see.

406
00:29:57,166 --> 00:29:59,666
For God's sake, Vi,
I'm trying to drink me breakfast.

407
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,083
Blood!

408
00:30:02,583 --> 00:30:04,958
Now, see what you've done.
You've set her off now.

409
00:30:05,041 --> 00:30:06,958
Oh, Syd, don't say anything to upset me.

410
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:10,958
You know how my nerves are.
I can't take it anymore.

411
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:14,250
You all live here, do you?

412
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:18,333
Here? Live here?

413
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:20,291
Knowing that...

414
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:22,500
Oh.

415
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:26,000
No, we have a house in Esher.

416
00:30:26,083 --> 00:30:29,708
Sydney built it.
He's a building contractor.

417
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:34,333
Do you remember that block of flats
that fell down last year? They were his.

418
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,458
Rows and rows of concrete,
all around the town.

419
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:39,541
I forgot to put the girders in
and they all fell down.

420
00:30:42,833 --> 00:30:44,958
What business you in then?

421
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,458
- Ornithology.
- He's an orni-what?

422
00:30:48,541 --> 00:30:50,125
Bird watching.

423
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:56,750
- Tits!
- Oh!

424
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:59,208
You get to see a lot of those, I suppose!

425
00:31:00,541 --> 00:31:04,833
- Well, they're birds, aren't they?
- They call it the bird from hell.

426
00:31:04,916 --> 00:31:07,541
- What?
- It's just a superstition.

427
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:12,666
Legend has it that all who are unfaithful
to the owners of Grimsdyke Manor

428
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:18,000
shall die screaming
in the claws of a monstrous demon.

429
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:21,166
She means that bloody great stuffed thing
hanging up in the hall.

430
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:25,666
Sometimes at night, its ghostly voice
can be heard across the moors,

431
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,416
screaming out for blood!

432
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:35,375
Right, I'm off to the river.
See you later, everybody.

433
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:38,500
But you haven't eaten anything.
Oh, do have a yeast tablet.

434
00:31:38,583 --> 00:31:40,583
No, thank you.

435
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:49,375
I...

436
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:53,250
I don't want to appear curious,
but tell me...

437
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:57,583
Marmaduke.

438
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:03,000
You silly bitch.

439
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:05,416
Marmaduke Grimsdyke.

440
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,416
We don't talk about Marmaduke Grimsdyke.

441
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,250
No!

442
00:32:14,416 --> 00:32:17,833
There's a young gentleman outside
to see you, Miss Sutton.

443
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:19,416
A Mr. Radleigh.

444
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:22,000
Oh, thank you, Craddock.
Will you tell him to wait in the hall?

445
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:23,208
Very good.

446
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:27,083
Not some dark secret from your murky past,
Laura, surely?

447
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,625
I say, what are you doing?

448
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:15,625
- Oh, hello.
- What are you doing?

449
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:18,875
- I'm bird spotting.
- How exciting.

450
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:22,750
- What was your name again?
- Judd. Judd Blake.

451
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:25,500
You're not related to the Hurlington
Blakes by any chance?

452
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:27,291
No, I shouldn't think so.

453
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:29,458
I'm Clarissa.

454
00:33:30,666 --> 00:33:32,083
Yes, I remember.

455
00:33:32,166 --> 00:33:34,500
Do you fancy a little row down the river?

456
00:33:34,583 --> 00:33:36,125
Well, um...

457
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:39,958
Come on, it might be fun.

458
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:43,375
All right, then.

459
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:52,833
Hadn't you better untie it first?

460
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:14,083
- Rowlocks.
- What?

461
00:34:14,166 --> 00:34:18,166
- You haven't got them in your rowlocks.
- Oh, yeah.

462
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:23,416
- So, how long have you known her then?
- Known who?

463
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,041
- Laura.
- Not long.

464
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:28,000
Weren't getting jealous, were you?

465
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:31,708
- Jealous? No, no.
- Who is he anyway?

466
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:35,375
I don't know.
Probably a good friend, I expect.

467
00:34:35,458 --> 00:34:38,250
Looks a bit more than a friend to me.

468
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:41,250
Yes, well, I wouldn't know about that.

469
00:34:41,333 --> 00:34:43,750
I think you were spying on them.

470
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:47,708
And what makes you think that then?

471
00:34:47,791 --> 00:34:49,208
Intuition.

472
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,250
Oh! Oh, dear!

473
00:34:56,416 --> 00:35:00,583
Oh! Quick! Grab hold of this.

474
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:03,083
Thank you very much.
I've just wet my trousers, haven't I?

475
00:35:04,833 --> 00:35:06,541
Oh, goodness!

476
00:35:08,958 --> 00:35:12,250
Don't worry,
no one can see us here.

477
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:14,166
Mmm. Clarissa.

478
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,250
Oh, Judd.

479
00:35:58,875 --> 00:35:59,875
In! Out!

480
00:36:01,083 --> 00:36:02,083
In! Out!

481
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:04,750
In! Out!

482
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:08,125
Put your backs into it!

483
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,791
In! Out!

484
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:12,625
In! Out!

485
00:36:14,666 --> 00:36:16,166
In! Out!

486
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:19,041
In! Out!

487
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,000
In! Out!

488
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:23,208
In! Out!

489
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:25,791
In! Out!

490
00:36:27,041 --> 00:36:28,500
In! Out!

491
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:10,375
Idiot! What the devil does he think
he's playing at?

492
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:13,000
Doesn't look very good, does it?

493
00:37:13,083 --> 00:37:15,583
What the hell is Blake going to say
when he finds out?

494
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:19,291
- You can see everything.
- I knew it.

495
00:37:19,375 --> 00:37:21,333
He's just going to get himself
in deeper and deeper

496
00:37:21,416 --> 00:37:24,041
until he doesn't know where he's at.

497
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:29,291
She's quite pretty, I suppose.
If you like that sort of thing.

498
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:31,208
We'll have to go down there
first thing in the morning

499
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,208
and make sure he doesn't get into
any more trouble.

500
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:24,583
What are you doing here?

501
00:38:24,666 --> 00:38:29,166
Just admiring the decorations.
Lovely place you've got here.

502
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:32,083
I foresaw a death in my tea leaves.

503
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:35,250
Someone is about to die. I can sense it.

504
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,291
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

505
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:59,458
There's people popping up
and disappearing all over the place.

506
00:38:59,541 --> 00:39:02,041
You know, I suspect there's a secret panel
here somewhere.

507
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:04,541
There are, lots of them.

508
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:08,125
You found out who it is yet?

509
00:39:08,208 --> 00:39:10,416
No. I'm just searching for some clues.

510
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,208
But don't worry, as soon as
I find some, I'll know who it is.

511
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:16,458
Look, um,

512
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:19,333
I was thinking, you know...

513
00:39:19,416 --> 00:39:23,291
Later on tonight...
I don't suppose you fancy a quick one...

514
00:39:23,375 --> 00:39:27,333
I mean, if you're nervous about
sleeping alone,

515
00:39:27,416 --> 00:39:29,041
I don't mind...

516
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:31,208
It's all right. I always lock my door.

517
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:34,041
You always lock your door. Very wise.

518
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:36,125
Good night, Judd.

519
00:39:36,208 --> 00:39:38,791
If I were you, I'd lock yours, too.

520
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,208
- Can I help you, sir?
- What?

521
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:08,333
- Oh!
- Can I help you, sir?

522
00:41:09,458 --> 00:41:13,125
That...
That big bird, it's very interesting.

523
00:41:15,458 --> 00:41:17,625
The Grimsdyke Vulture, sir.

524
00:41:19,625 --> 00:41:21,541
Yeah, yeah.

525
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:26,583
Who's the fellow in the chain mail?

526
00:41:26,666 --> 00:41:29,125
Marmaduke Grimsdyke.

527
00:41:29,208 --> 00:41:32,000
We don't talk about him, sir.

528
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:32,166
I don't know why you made me come
all the way out here.

529
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,666
Why couldn't you come to the hotel?

530
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:37,458
Are you just going to stand there
or are you going to give it to me?

531
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:48,125
Hello there.

532
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,750
Hello, Percy, been a good boy then?

533
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,208
What happened?

534
00:43:53,291 --> 00:43:55,125
It was an accident.
I fell on top of him. He's out cold.

535
00:43:55,208 --> 00:43:57,041
- Have you got any smelling salts?
- Who is it?

536
00:43:57,125 --> 00:44:00,833
Oh! It's Scott. Whatever's he doing here?

537
00:44:00,916 --> 00:44:04,750
He's not breathing.
Oh, my God, I've killed him.

538
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:05,916
He's been shot.

539
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,500
It was an accident,
I fell on top of him. I...

540
00:44:07,583 --> 00:44:09,541
- He's been what?
- Look.

541
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:15,000
Look, the thing to do is
to keep perfectly calm and not panic.

542
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:17,750
So don't panic. Don't panic.
Let's go and get the police.

543
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:20,208
I'll phone the police,
and then we'll go and get the police.

544
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:22,291
No. No, no. No, wait!

545
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:25,666
- Will you wait?
- What?

546
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:28,750
Obviously, it isn't an accident.

547
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,916
- You mean, he's been murdered?
- Yes.

548
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,416
Oh, my God. Listen.

549
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:35,416
What do you phone for the police?

550
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,125
Christ, it's on the tip of my tongue.
What is it?

551
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:39,416
- I mean...
- Just wait. Will you just wait?

552
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,000
You don't understand, he's been murdered!

553
00:44:41,083 --> 00:44:45,291
I know. But if you stop rushing into
things, and let me think clearly.

554
00:44:45,375 --> 00:44:47,875
Think clearly. Yes, that's very good.
Think clearly.

555
00:44:47,958 --> 00:44:49,916
999. That's what it is.
I knew it was something...

556
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,541
Before you do anything,
just sit down and let me think.

557
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:59,125
Look, if he was shot outside,
we'd have heard it. Right?

558
00:44:59,208 --> 00:45:01,208
- Right.
- Right!

559
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:04,416
Therefore he must have crawled there,

560
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:09,250
or been placed there by somebody.

561
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:11,458
For what possible reason?

562
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,625
- Don't you see?
- No.

563
00:45:16,708 --> 00:45:18,916
To incriminate me.

564
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,791
That's exactly the kind of scandal
that everybody was waiting for.

565
00:45:23,875 --> 00:45:25,625
- We'll have to hide him.
- What?

566
00:45:25,708 --> 00:45:27,333
Will you shut up?

567
00:45:27,416 --> 00:45:31,625
If we can just delay him being found
for a few days,

568
00:45:31,708 --> 00:45:34,791
until the estate is mine.

569
00:45:34,875 --> 00:45:36,958
After that, it doesn't matter.

570
00:45:37,041 --> 00:45:41,416
- You can't do that.
- Oh, Judd, darling.

571
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,625
That is the answer.

572
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:45,375
What about the police?

573
00:45:45,458 --> 00:45:47,750
I mean, you can't just go around
hiding dead bodies.

574
00:45:47,833 --> 00:45:50,083
You know, there's a law against
that sort of thing.

575
00:45:50,166 --> 00:45:53,000
Nobody will ever know.

576
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,666
There's a quarry not far from here.

577
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:57,583
He wouldn't be found for days.

578
00:45:57,666 --> 00:46:01,875
No, I'm sorry, Laura.
Absolutely, definitely, emphatically no.

579
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:07,625
But what we're really doing is
helping the police.

580
00:46:07,708 --> 00:46:08,791
Are we?

581
00:46:08,875 --> 00:46:13,500
Well, Scott wasn't murdered here.
He was murdered somewhere else,

582
00:46:13,583 --> 00:46:17,250
so by us moving the body, we are stopping
the police from being confused.

583
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:19,375
I don't think they will see it
quite like that somehow.

584
00:46:19,458 --> 00:46:20,750
Especially if they find out.

585
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:31,625
- Good evening, Craddock.
- Good night, madam.

586
00:46:35,458 --> 00:46:38,583
As soon as it's light,
you can get rid of it properly.

587
00:46:38,666 --> 00:46:40,625
What do you mean, "as soon as it's light"?

588
00:46:40,708 --> 00:46:42,291
Well, it's going to look suspicious

589
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:45,416
if you try and get rid of it
in the middle of the night.

590
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:48,583
Oh, Judd, you don't know
what this means to me.

591
00:46:48,666 --> 00:46:50,541
About...

592
00:46:50,625 --> 00:46:53,916
About 10 years I should think,
if they find out.

593
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,291
Come on.

594
00:47:58,791 --> 00:48:01,083
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

595
00:48:01,166 --> 00:48:05,875
I shouldn't think you can see much behind
with that on the back.

596
00:48:05,958 --> 00:48:07,791
Well, I saw you.

597
00:48:09,791 --> 00:48:14,625
It's contrary to the Motor Vehicles
Construction and Use Regulations,

598
00:48:14,708 --> 00:48:17,875
Section 40, sub-paragraph 5,

599
00:48:17,958 --> 00:48:20,500
Road Traffic Act 1972.

600
00:48:20,583 --> 00:48:21,750
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, Officer,

601
00:48:21,833 --> 00:48:25,208
I didn't realize
that I was contravening...

602
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,916
Where's your spare wheel?

603
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,916
Well, it's in the back, I suppose. Why?

604
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,125
You're gonna need it.
You've got a flat tire.

605
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,291
Right, sir, if you'd care to get
out of the car, I'll give you a hand.

606
00:48:42,375 --> 00:48:44,166
- It shouldn't take long.
- That's all right, Officer.

607
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:46,666
Actually, I can manage on my own.
It's going to be okay.

608
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:50,041
In spite of what the public thinks,
we do like to help sometimes.

609
00:48:50,125 --> 00:48:53,833
Now you're gonna need a hand with this,
otherwise you'll never get the wheel out.

610
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:58,500
Right, if you'd like
to take the other end.

611
00:48:58,583 --> 00:49:00,458
Ready? One, two, three.

612
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,416
What have you got in here then, a body?

613
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:15,125
It's all right, actually.
Thank you, Officer.

614
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:16,250
I can manage very well now.

615
00:49:16,333 --> 00:49:17,541
Thank you very much.

616
00:49:17,625 --> 00:49:20,333
- Thank you.
- Oh, all right then. Bye.

617
00:49:35,708 --> 00:49:40,541
Did I leave my gloves here?
Oh. There they are.

618
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:42,791
Bye.

619
00:49:54,708 --> 00:49:57,083
Having a spot of bother?

620
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:00,833
Yes.

621
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:03,750
I thought you were.

622
00:50:06,416 --> 00:50:09,083
I'm Sally. I'm a housewife.

623
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:15,208
- Really?
- Rather boring really, being a housewife.

624
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:21,666
Would you like a cup of tea?

625
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,625
No, thank you.

626
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:40,583
Would you like to wash your hands?

627
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:43,083
Oh, yes, I wouldn't mind actually.
Thanks very much.

628
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:49,375
I did enjoy our little chat outside.
It was really interesting.

629
00:50:50,833 --> 00:50:52,333
Fascinating.

630
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:56,583
That's how you get to know
people, isn't it? By chatting.

631
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:02,958
- Have you... Have you got a towel?
- Pink or blue?

632
00:51:03,041 --> 00:51:05,916
- Well, I'm easy.
- I thought you might be.

633
00:51:06,875 --> 00:51:09,250
You've got that look about you.

634
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:39,333
I knew you'd be just game for anything
the moment I saw you out there.

635
00:51:39,416 --> 00:51:41,541
No, no. I didn't mean that...

636
00:51:41,625 --> 00:51:45,666
Does it do things for you?
I see all the sex films, you know.

637
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:49,500
Hot Lust and Sweaty Thighs.
Nuns in Rubber.

638
00:51:49,583 --> 00:51:52,958
Now look, I mean, I didn't...
I just... I thought that...

639
00:51:53,041 --> 00:51:55,833
Well, ordinary sex
gets so boring, doesn't it?

640
00:51:55,916 --> 00:51:59,500
Especially with Frederick.
He's my husband.

641
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:02,833
He's got no imagination.
Not like the milkman.

642
00:52:02,916 --> 00:52:06,750
You'd be amazed what he gets up to
with his extra pint of...

643
00:52:12,583 --> 00:52:14,916
Then it's into the high heel boots
and Gestapo uniform

644
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,458
for a quick bit of The Night Porter
with the gasman.

645
00:52:26,958 --> 00:52:29,250
How about a bit of Last Tango in Paris?

646
00:52:29,333 --> 00:52:32,083
- I've got loads of butter in the fridge.
- Oh, Christ.

647
00:52:35,458 --> 00:52:36,958
I would have suggested Deep Throat,

648
00:52:37,041 --> 00:52:39,708
but I tried it with the window cleaner
last week and nearly choked myself.

649
00:52:39,791 --> 00:52:42,250
Look, love. I only came in here
to get me hands washed.

650
00:52:42,333 --> 00:52:46,166
- Oh! I love it when they play hard to get.
- Leave it out!

651
00:53:02,625 --> 00:53:05,375
- Lost it?
- It was an accident.

652
00:53:05,458 --> 00:53:06,875
How could you?

653
00:53:06,958 --> 00:53:10,333
I just turned my back for a second,
that's all, and then it was gone.

654
00:53:10,416 --> 00:53:13,916
- I was washing my hands.
- Washing your hands?

655
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:18,041
Look, I had to change the wheel, didn't I?
And then this woman came out,

656
00:53:18,125 --> 00:53:20,833
but that was after
the policeman pulled me up.

657
00:53:20,916 --> 00:53:23,875
Well, he didn't exactly pull me up.
But he wanted to change the wheel,

658
00:53:23,958 --> 00:53:26,708
I had to help him, otherwise it would
have looked suspicious, wouldn't it?

659
00:53:26,791 --> 00:53:28,791
I had to and I did.

660
00:53:28,875 --> 00:53:32,125
And then this funny woman came out
with kinky black leather, boots, whip...

661
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:34,208
The trunk! Where is it?

662
00:53:38,666 --> 00:53:41,458
Oh, no. What are you two doing down here?

663
00:53:41,541 --> 00:53:43,416
Why? What have you done now?

664
00:53:47,416 --> 00:53:49,583
I don't believe it.
I just do not believe it.

665
00:53:49,666 --> 00:53:51,500
Even you couldn't be that stupid.

666
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:55,416
All right. I'll admit there's been
a slight error of judgment on my part.

667
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:59,333
Error? Do you realize
what you've got yourself into?

668
00:53:59,416 --> 00:54:03,125
Following somebody about with binoculars
is one thing, but murder?

669
00:54:03,208 --> 00:54:04,583
You've really landed
yourself in it this time.

670
00:54:04,666 --> 00:54:08,666
It's no good you keep going on about it.
I mean, I didn't murder him, did I?

671
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:11,916
I'll admit that things haven't gone
quite as I'd liked them to...

672
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,458
There's no talking to him.
I give up. I just give up.

673
00:54:14,541 --> 00:54:17,333
Oh, I'm sure he was only trying to help.

674
00:54:17,416 --> 00:54:18,958
I told you not to take this case
in the first place,

675
00:54:19,041 --> 00:54:21,041
but you wouldn't listen to me.

676
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:23,208
But I've solved it.
I mean, I know who murdered him.

677
00:54:23,291 --> 00:54:25,916
It's just a question of proving it,
that's all.

678
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,666
What do you mean,
you know who murdered him?

679
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:31,750
- I do. His accomplice.
- Then why haven't you told the police?

680
00:54:32,708 --> 00:54:35,041
Well, because I'm not quite sure
exactly who the accomplice is yet,

681
00:54:35,125 --> 00:54:37,666
- but I've got some suspects.
- Suspects.

682
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:40,000
You wait until you see how strange
the butler's been acting lately.

683
00:54:40,083 --> 00:54:43,000
What does that Miss Sutton
have to say about it?

684
00:54:43,083 --> 00:54:44,750
Well, she reckons the best thing to do now

685
00:54:44,833 --> 00:54:47,000
is just to try and solve
the case as quickly as possible.

686
00:54:49,041 --> 00:54:51,875
Listen, that trunk has probably
been opened already,

687
00:54:51,958 --> 00:54:55,166
and if it has, it will be no time at all
before it's traced back to this place,

688
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:58,541
so you go to the police before they come
to you and you tell them everything.

689
00:54:58,625 --> 00:55:00,666
I can't do that. I promised Laura.

690
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:03,875
It's the only chance you've got
of getting yourself out of this mess,

691
00:55:03,958 --> 00:55:07,333
short of pleading insanity. On second
thought, that's probably your best chance.

692
00:55:07,416 --> 00:55:10,250
Look, if I tell the whole story,
Laura will inherit nothing.

693
00:55:10,333 --> 00:55:12,083
Well, so what?

694
00:55:12,166 --> 00:55:15,708
It's better than being an accessory and
going to prison for the rest of your life.

695
00:55:15,791 --> 00:55:18,000
He's right, you know.

696
00:55:33,291 --> 00:55:36,916
- Is the plumber there?
- No, no. I'm sorry, he hasn't been here.

697
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,666
- Do send him round.
- Yes, I'll tell him as soon as he comes.

698
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:41,458
Goodbye, ma'am.

699
00:55:47,458 --> 00:55:49,833
The Inspector, please.

700
00:55:49,916 --> 00:55:52,625
Oh, yes. You've come to the wrong place.
He's not here.

701
00:55:52,708 --> 00:55:55,041
- Pardon?
- No, I just had his wife on the phone.

702
00:55:55,125 --> 00:55:57,041
- Wondered what happened to you.
- What happened to me?

703
00:55:57,125 --> 00:55:59,875
- Yes. She expects you.
- Really?

704
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:07,083
Yes. You'll find his house, Number 6,
on the right, the one with the red door.

705
00:56:09,375 --> 00:56:11,916
Well, what are you waiting for?

706
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,625
- The one with the red door?
- The one with the red door.

707
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,833
Thank goodness you're here.
I was getting quite desperate.

708
00:56:33,916 --> 00:56:36,000
- Do come in.
- Thank you.

709
00:56:36,083 --> 00:56:37,750
The kitchen's at the back.

710
00:56:37,833 --> 00:56:41,208
I tried to do it myself,
but it wasn't really very satisfactory.

711
00:56:41,291 --> 00:56:44,875
What I really needed was a nice long tool
to poke it with properly,

712
00:56:44,958 --> 00:56:47,625
if you see what I mean.
I hunted about for hours,

713
00:56:47,708 --> 00:56:49,875
but I couldn't find anything satisfactory.

714
00:56:49,958 --> 00:56:53,333
Finally I decided the only thing to do
is to get a man round instead.

715
00:56:53,416 --> 00:56:57,041
- Yes, well, actually, I've come to...
- Solve my little problem. Yes, I know.

716
00:56:57,125 --> 00:56:59,750
I do hope you've got
the right equipment for it.

717
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,041
It's probably just tea leaves.

718
00:57:02,125 --> 00:57:04,333
Oh, no, no.
You've got it wrong. I'm not...

719
00:57:04,416 --> 00:57:07,333
Quite sure what it is.
I do understand, Mr...

720
00:57:07,416 --> 00:57:08,708
West.

721
00:57:08,791 --> 00:57:11,625
You see, well, everyone thinks it's Blake.

722
00:57:11,708 --> 00:57:14,541
How strange. Blake doesn't sound
a bit like West.

723
00:57:14,625 --> 00:57:19,541
I suppose you'll probably try
to suck it out with your little plunger.

724
00:57:19,625 --> 00:57:21,291
Drink?

725
00:57:24,625 --> 00:57:26,583
- Say when.
- When.

726
00:57:27,583 --> 00:57:30,000
- What?
- When.

727
00:57:33,208 --> 00:57:37,250
My goodness,
you certainly like your drink, don't you?

728
00:57:37,333 --> 00:57:39,750
I like a man who's not afraid to admit It.

729
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:41,791
Listen. When I came round,

730
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:44,833
I thought your husband
was going to be here.

731
00:57:44,916 --> 00:57:49,541
Oh, he won't be home for ages yet.
Why don't you come and sit down?

732
00:57:51,666 --> 00:57:52,916
Cheers.

733
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:00,125
- Cheers.
- Is it getting hard?

734
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:04,750
- Pardon?
- Finding work?

735
00:58:04,833 --> 00:58:06,958
Oh, yeah, well...

736
00:58:08,375 --> 00:58:12,250
- Look, are you sure about your husband?
- Positive.

737
00:58:12,333 --> 00:58:15,333
- He is the Inspector?
- Yes.

738
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:19,625
And he's a very difficult man
to live with, I can tell you.

739
00:58:19,708 --> 00:58:24,125
- Oh, really?
- I don't want you to get the wrong idea,

740
00:58:24,208 --> 00:58:28,833
but I get the kind of feeling that you're
the sort of man I could really depend on.

741
00:58:28,916 --> 00:58:31,125
But...

742
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:36,250
- What about the husband?
- Oh, he won't be back for ages yet.

743
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:38,041
Plenty of time.

744
00:58:46,166 --> 00:58:47,458
Mummy!

745
00:58:53,208 --> 00:58:54,541
Mummy!

746
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:09,000
Mum! Mummy!

747
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:11,333
What are you doing?

748
00:59:11,416 --> 00:59:13,791
Mummy's just having a little chat
with the plumber.

749
00:59:13,875 --> 00:59:15,916
Why are you lying down?

750
00:59:17,333 --> 00:59:19,916
Don't ask silly questions.
Do as I told you and go to bed.

751
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:23,416
I'll go.

752
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:26,791
- Where did he come from?
- Upstairs. My God.

753
00:59:30,208 --> 00:59:31,458
Quick!

754
00:59:36,041 --> 00:59:38,041
Hello, Willy. Is your mummy in?

755
00:59:38,125 --> 00:59:40,750
Yes. She's with the plumber.

756
00:59:43,583 --> 00:59:46,541
Oh, Mrs. Grimpton. What a lovely surprise.

757
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:50,333
- I do hope I'm not interrupting anything.
- Oh, no.

758
00:59:50,416 --> 00:59:53,625
Why were you jumping up and down
on top of Mummy?

759
00:59:53,708 --> 00:59:57,333
Willy dear, it's way past your bedtime.

760
01:00:07,416 --> 01:00:08,708
Daddy!

761
01:00:08,791 --> 01:00:11,791
Hello, hello, little man. Want to come up?

762
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:14,458
There, what a big Willy I've got.

763
01:00:16,166 --> 01:00:18,291
Hello, hello, hello.
What's going on here then?

764
01:00:18,375 --> 01:00:20,125
Darling, you're home early.

765
01:00:20,208 --> 01:00:22,333
I just popped in to tell you
I'm working late tonight.

766
01:00:22,416 --> 01:00:26,166
That missing person business at the hotel.
Turned out nasty, I'm afraid.

767
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:28,750
Afternoon, Mrs. Grimpton.
How's the Reverend?

768
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:30,666
Bearing up as usual.

769
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:33,250
Daddy, why don't plumbers
wear any trousers?

770
01:00:33,333 --> 01:00:37,875
Darling, that's the plumber.
He's just come to unblock the sink.

771
01:00:37,958 --> 01:00:40,166
Plumber? Local, are you?

772
01:00:41,625 --> 01:00:44,125
Why has he put his trousers
back on, Daddy?

773
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:47,333
Does that mean he's not going to
jump up and down anymore?

774
01:00:47,416 --> 01:00:49,875
Excuse me, mate.
Is this where the blockage is?

775
01:00:49,958 --> 01:00:52,708
Crikey. Is that the time?
Well, I'll just have to be running along

776
01:00:52,791 --> 01:00:55,958
because I've got
a few more appointments...

777
01:00:56,958 --> 01:01:00,208
Then the real plumber came in and it...

778
01:01:00,916 --> 01:01:04,250
Somebody just put this
underneath my bedroom door.

779
01:01:05,125 --> 01:01:08,666
"The Burlesque Club.
Table five, 10:00 sharp.

780
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:11,750
"Bring the money in used notes."

781
01:01:11,833 --> 01:01:15,625
Yes, well, that's where he's made
his final mistake, isn't it?

782
01:01:15,708 --> 01:01:17,416
What final mistake?

783
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:20,708
Well, I give him the money, he hands over
the negatives and then I nab him.

784
01:01:20,791 --> 01:01:21,791
You nab him?

785
01:01:21,875 --> 01:01:23,750
Yeah.
I'll just wait for him to expose himself,

786
01:01:23,833 --> 01:01:25,291
and then I'll pinch him.

787
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,625
Well, as long as
he doesn't get sidetracked

788
01:01:26,708 --> 01:01:28,291
like some people we could mention.

789
01:01:28,375 --> 01:01:30,791
All I want to know is
where am I going to get 50,000 from?

790
01:01:30,875 --> 01:01:32,875
Don't you worry, love.

791
01:01:32,958 --> 01:01:35,875
I know exactly how these things are done.

792
01:01:36,666 --> 01:01:38,666
Do you really think
that's going to work?

793
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:40,041
Never fails.

794
01:01:40,125 --> 01:01:44,041
See, you just put the proper money
at the top and it all looks real.

795
01:01:44,125 --> 01:01:45,541
I wonder who it's going to turn out to be?

796
01:01:45,625 --> 01:01:46,833
The butler.

797
01:01:46,916 --> 01:01:49,916
- That's who did it, the butler.
- How do you work that one out?

798
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,708
Call it a hunch, if you like.

799
01:01:51,791 --> 01:01:54,750
- Call it a wild guess.
- You'll see.

800
01:01:54,833 --> 01:01:57,583
Look, I didn't like to
voice my suspicions beforehand,

801
01:01:57,666 --> 01:02:01,333
but tonight after he turns up at that
club, I'll have all the proof I need.

802
01:02:01,416 --> 01:02:05,041
- You'd better. Otherwise, I'm in trouble.
- Don't worry.

803
01:02:05,125 --> 01:02:07,250
It'll be the butler. He's the blackmailer.

804
01:02:07,333 --> 01:02:09,958
He's also a murderer.

805
01:02:10,041 --> 01:02:12,708
Yeah, well, don't worry.

806
01:02:12,791 --> 01:02:15,416
I know how to look after myself.

807
01:02:46,375 --> 01:02:49,750
You know, I don't think
this is such a good idea.

808
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:52,000
These sort of things
always make me feel so nervous.

809
01:02:52,083 --> 01:02:54,333
Father would wish us to
speak with him.

810
01:02:54,416 --> 01:02:58,041
I don't understand why,
he had no time for you while he was alive.

811
01:02:58,125 --> 01:03:02,125
- What are you lot doing now?
- We're going to have a seance.

812
01:03:02,208 --> 01:03:04,666
Where's Judd? Maybe he'd like to join us.

813
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:07,416
Oh, he went to visit someone in town.

814
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:10,375
- You'll be joining us though, won't you?
- Oh, no, I don't think so.

815
01:03:10,458 --> 01:03:14,458
I think Father's going to be very upset
if you don't have a word with him.

816
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:18,708
Listen, birdie, if I've got to sit through
this blasted nonsense, you can as well.

817
01:03:18,791 --> 01:03:21,625
- Cloth!
- Yes. Well, this is nice, isn't it?

818
01:03:21,708 --> 01:03:25,166
- I always did like having my fortune told.
- Lights!

819
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:37,375
Now if we all place our index finger
very lightly on top of the glass.

820
01:03:39,958 --> 01:03:42,041
We are having a seance, round we all sit.

821
01:03:42,125 --> 01:03:45,000
If you want my opinion,
it's a right load of...

822
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:59,333
Everyone place their hands gently
on the table, fingers lightly touching.

823
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:06,916
What was that?

824
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,041
- Is there anybody there?
- My God!

825
01:04:15,625 --> 01:04:18,708
Who is it? Speak! Speak!

826
01:04:20,875 --> 01:04:24,625
Who's there? Speak! Speak!

827
01:04:28,833 --> 01:04:30,833
I need a bloody drink.

828
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:35,458
Someone touched me! Oh!

829
01:04:36,375 --> 01:04:41,000
Yes, yes. There's definitely someone
in the room. I can feel it. I can feel it.

830
01:04:41,083 --> 01:04:44,375
Father, Father, is it you?

831
01:04:44,458 --> 01:04:47,916
Oh, my God.
Supposing it's Marmaduke Grimsdyke?

832
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,416
- Marmaduke, if it is thou, be gone, I say!
- Marmaduke, piss off.

833
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:57,041
Who is it? Answer me, Father.
If it is you then answer me.

834
01:04:57,125 --> 01:04:59,875
One knock for yes.

835
01:04:59,958 --> 01:05:02,708
Two knocks for no.

836
01:05:05,916 --> 01:05:09,500
One knock for yes,
two knocks for no.

837
01:05:10,791 --> 01:05:13,708
Who is it? Speak! Speak! Who is it?

838
01:05:14,833 --> 01:05:17,833
It's only me, madam.
Inspector Hogg, to see you.

839
01:05:17,916 --> 01:05:20,625
Sorry to disturb you like this.
Just a few routine enquiries, that's all,

840
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:22,416
in connection with a Mr. Scott Radleigh.

841
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,333
I believe he called here
yesterday morning.

842
01:05:24,416 --> 01:05:26,500
Wasn't that the fellow
who came to see Laura?

843
01:05:26,583 --> 01:05:28,833
Nothing that might
create a scandal, I hope.

844
01:05:28,916 --> 01:05:33,416
- You knew him, did you?
- Well, slightly, from when I was a model.

845
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:34,791
I see.

846
01:05:34,875 --> 01:05:37,416
Are you also acquainted
with a Mr. and Mrs. Boodle

847
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,208
- of 36 Abersham Crescent, Reading?
- Oh, no.

848
01:05:40,291 --> 01:05:43,666
- They moved there yesterday.
- What's that got to do with Scott?

849
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:46,041
He fell out of a trunk
while they were unpacking.

850
01:05:46,125 --> 01:05:48,291
I'm sorry to have to tell you,
he'd been shot.

851
01:05:48,375 --> 01:05:49,458
Shot?

852
01:05:49,541 --> 01:05:51,541
Surely you don't suspect Miss Sutton, sir.

853
01:05:51,625 --> 01:05:55,208
- Think of the scandal.
- Just a few routine enquiries, that's all.

854
01:05:55,291 --> 01:05:57,666
- I saw it. I saw it all.
- You witnessed it?

855
01:05:57,750 --> 01:06:01,500
In the tea leaves.
The curse of the Grimsdyke Vulture.

856
01:06:04,583 --> 01:06:07,708
I think I'm going to have
a nervous breakdown.

857
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:12,541
Good heavens.
What's that plumber doing under the table?

858
01:06:13,958 --> 01:06:16,958
He's not a plumber. He's a bird watcher.

859
01:06:17,041 --> 01:06:19,708
Well, he wouldn't find any under there.

860
01:06:19,791 --> 01:06:24,333
If I could have a word with you in
private, please, Inspector? Please?

861
01:06:26,458 --> 01:06:29,958
He was the first to die.
There will be more.

862
01:06:30,041 --> 01:06:32,583
The tea leaves never lie.

863
01:06:33,958 --> 01:06:38,708
So you see, Inspector, I'm not a plumber,
nor am I a bird watcher.

864
01:06:38,791 --> 01:06:40,750
I'm a private detective,
and I'm down here on a case

865
01:06:40,833 --> 01:06:43,083
and I just didn't want anybody
to find out, that's all.

866
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:45,750
What were you doing at my house
with my wife?

867
01:06:45,833 --> 01:06:48,916
Well... Well, I felt that I should
let you know who I was,

868
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,125
what I was doing down here,
just in case you were wondering.

869
01:06:51,208 --> 01:06:53,958
I see. Nothing to do with
this Scott Radleigh business?

870
01:06:54,041 --> 01:06:57,541
Oh, no, no, no. I'm just down here
checking up on somebody, that's all.

871
01:06:57,625 --> 01:06:58,875
Now you just watch your step.

872
01:06:58,958 --> 01:07:01,458
I don't like private detectives,
never have.

873
01:07:01,541 --> 01:07:04,500
- Bloody amateurs.
- Yeah.

874
01:07:04,583 --> 01:07:05,916
Well, if I can be of any assistance...

875
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,375
You just keep your nose out of it
or you and me will fall out.

876
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:14,416
Now if you'll excuse me, I rather think
I'd better be getting along, don't you?

877
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:17,458
- Do you mind if I ask you a question?
- No.

878
01:07:18,416 --> 01:07:20,833
What were you doing jumping up and down?

879
01:07:21,916 --> 01:07:26,000
Oh, it was cramp. I get terrible cramp.

880
01:07:26,958 --> 01:07:29,833
You have to keep moving with it,
you see, otherwise...

881
01:07:29,916 --> 01:07:31,000
Cramp?

882
01:07:31,458 --> 01:07:34,375
Hello, Wilfred Crimble, press. My card.

883
01:07:34,458 --> 01:07:35,875
- What?
- My card.

884
01:07:35,958 --> 01:07:38,708
- Who let you in here?
- Been a murder, isn't it?

885
01:07:38,791 --> 01:07:41,458
- Fancy giving us an exclusive?
- Certainly not. Now shove off.

886
01:07:41,541 --> 01:07:45,166
Not about how you're actually
a private detective?

887
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:47,166
How did you know that?

888
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:49,541
I overheard your conversation
with Inspector Hogg over there.

889
01:07:49,625 --> 01:07:50,666
What's going on here?

890
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:52,083
Derek, deal with him, will you?
I've got to go.

891
01:07:52,166 --> 01:07:55,375
Hello, Crimble, press.
You one of the murder suspects?

892
01:07:55,625 --> 01:07:56,625
Well...

893
01:07:56,708 --> 01:07:58,500
Care to say a few words, would you?
Slowly.

894
01:07:58,583 --> 01:08:01,916
- Look...
- How well did you know the dead body?

895
01:08:03,666 --> 01:08:06,083
- No...
- "No..."

896
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:08,375
- Comment.
- "Comment."

897
01:08:26,333 --> 01:08:29,916
Oi. Where do you think you're going?

898
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,375
- Inside.
- You a member, are you?

899
01:08:33,458 --> 01:08:36,958
Well, no, but I'm supposed to be
meeting somebody here.

900
01:08:37,041 --> 01:08:39,625
- Who?
- Well, I'm not sure exactly.

901
01:08:39,708 --> 01:08:41,333
What do you mean, you're not sure?

902
01:08:41,416 --> 01:08:44,250
Well, I won't know who it is
until I get inside, if you...

903
01:08:44,333 --> 01:08:46,458
No, I don't, mate.

904
01:08:46,541 --> 01:08:48,500
There must be a reservation booked.
Table Number Five.

905
01:08:48,583 --> 01:08:49,833
Why?

906
01:08:49,916 --> 01:08:52,125
Because that's where I'm going to meet
whoever it is.

907
01:08:52,208 --> 01:08:55,750
Table Number Five, 10:00 sharp.

908
01:08:55,833 --> 01:08:58,000
- Nothing here.
- Look, it's important that I get in there.

909
01:08:58,083 --> 01:09:01,041
- My name is... My name's Judd Blake.
- Yeah?

910
01:09:02,375 --> 01:09:04,708
Well, no, it isn't. Actually,
it's Bob West, but the thing is...

911
01:09:04,791 --> 01:09:06,458
Look, I don't know who you are, mate.

912
01:09:06,541 --> 01:09:08,083
You're not a member,
you ain't got a table booked,

913
01:09:08,166 --> 01:09:10,875
you don't know who you're meeting
and I don't like you, so piss off.

914
01:09:10,958 --> 01:09:14,958
Look, I've got to get in there, it's very
important. I've got to deliver this case.

915
01:09:15,041 --> 01:09:16,666
What's important?

916
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:18,875
All right, I'll level with you.

917
01:09:20,291 --> 01:09:22,458
I'm a private detective.

918
01:09:22,541 --> 01:09:26,916
A private detective. Well,
why didn't you say so in the first place?

919
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,416
Of course, that makes all the difference.

920
01:10:03,291 --> 01:10:06,166
Who? Did he? Right.

921
01:10:57,041 --> 01:10:59,583
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
the moment you've been waiting for.

922
01:10:59,666 --> 01:11:03,833
The star of our show,
the fabulous Miss Lisa Moroni.

923
01:11:08,416 --> 01:11:11,083
- You'll miss your cue.
- What? What?

924
01:11:19,416 --> 01:11:21,833
<i>I'm Moroni with an I
Not Moroni with an E</i>

925
01:11:21,916 --> 01:11:23,916
<i>'Cause Moroni with an E means stupid</i>

926
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,166
<i>Like "time" without a T
I'm a P without a bow</i>

927
01:11:26,250 --> 01:11:28,125
<i>'Cause I haven't got a bow like cupid</i>

928
01:11:28,208 --> 01:11:30,458
<i>Miss Helen of Troy
when she didn't have a boy</i>

929
01:11:30,541 --> 01:11:32,333
<i>had to sail across the sea to Paris</i>

930
01:11:32,416 --> 01:11:34,916
<i>And Mac with a Beth couldn't wait to get</i>

931
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,458
<i>when he rode behind his heiress</i>

932
01:11:36,541 --> 01:11:39,250
<i>So little old me
with a M-O-R-O-N-I spells "Moroni"</i>

933
01:11:39,333 --> 01:11:43,291
I thought we booked four girls?
Who's the big ugly blonde?

934
01:11:44,791 --> 01:11:47,041
<i>Lonely</i>

935
01:11:47,125 --> 01:11:50,375
<i>So terribly lonely</i>

936
01:11:51,166 --> 01:11:53,875
<i>Like fromage</i>

937
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:57,750
<i>with no macaroni</i>

938
01:11:57,833 --> 01:12:02,250
<i>So if a guy with a Y
tries to sample my salami</i>

939
01:12:02,333 --> 01:12:05,291
<i>I'll wink with an eye
and please with a D, Moroni</i>

940
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:08,166
<i>Ain't that B-A-R-M-Y, barmy? Oh!</i>

941
01:12:08,875 --> 01:12:10,791
- Hey, you.
- What?

942
01:12:10,875 --> 01:12:12,333
Nothing.

943
01:12:13,416 --> 01:12:17,416
I mean... I mean, I'm just...
Well, I'm just terrific.

944
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,166
I mean, you're terrific.

945
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:22,500
Oh, if Momma could only see me now, right?

946
01:12:22,583 --> 01:12:28,791
Listen, now I'd like to do a song.
It really means very much to me.

947
01:12:28,875 --> 01:12:33,000
Like being in the movies, or like...
Like being here tonight.

948
01:12:33,083 --> 01:12:38,375
But I want you to know,
this is my favorite song.

949
01:12:42,416 --> 01:12:46,375
<i>Momma told me all about propriety</i>

950
01:12:46,458 --> 01:12:49,541
<i>Not getting stuck in a rut</i>

951
01:12:49,625 --> 01:12:54,333
<i>But a girl's got to guard her integrity</i>

952
01:12:55,166 --> 01:12:58,041
<i>So give me my diamonds uncut</i>

953
01:12:58,125 --> 01:13:01,916
<i>And give me the real thing</i>

954
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,791
<i>Make my pendulums swing</i>

955
01:13:05,875 --> 01:13:09,125
<i>Don't want no mail order thing</i>

956
01:13:09,208 --> 01:13:12,666
<i>Give me the real, real thing</i>

957
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:14,666
<i>Real thing</i>

958
01:13:18,916 --> 01:13:21,666
Good evening, my dear.
Delighted to see you.

959
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:24,000
What can I get you to drink?

960
01:13:25,208 --> 01:13:26,875
A pint of bitter.

961
01:13:26,958 --> 01:13:28,708
Pint of bitter for
a lovely little girl like you?

962
01:13:28,791 --> 01:13:30,250
You should be drinking champagne.

963
01:13:30,333 --> 01:13:34,625
Waiter, bring me a bottle
of the best champagne you have, will you?

964
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:40,666
I'm Sir Basil Lemmington. Call me Bas
if you like. Makes no difference to me.

965
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:41,916
What's your name?

966
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,791
Look, let's leave
names out of it, shall we?

967
01:13:44,875 --> 01:13:47,916
You coy little temptress, you!

968
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,625
Pardon my asking, but you have
the most delightful set of knockers.

969
01:13:52,708 --> 01:13:54,791
Or have you? I can't see from here.

970
01:13:54,875 --> 01:13:58,500
Come here and let me have a better look.

971
01:13:58,583 --> 01:14:02,500
<i>They live life the nouveau riche way</i>

972
01:14:02,583 --> 01:14:06,250
<i>You know all I need is a roof and a bed</i>

973
01:14:06,333 --> 01:14:09,916
<i>As long as it's in St. Tropez</i>

974
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,333
<i>Give me the real thing, come on</i>

975
01:14:13,416 --> 01:14:16,833
<i>And make my pendulums swing</i>

976
01:14:16,916 --> 01:14:19,375
Look, let's stop fooling around
and get down to business, shall we?

977
01:14:19,458 --> 01:14:22,708
- How much?
- £50,000.

978
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:26,916
Fifty thousand?
It's a bit pricey, isn't it?

979
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,333
I've never paid more than 40.

980
01:14:28,416 --> 01:14:31,375
All right, all right, 40.
Let's not quibble.

981
01:14:31,458 --> 01:14:33,750
The thing is, how do I know
you've got the goods?

982
01:14:33,833 --> 01:14:35,500
I beg your pardon?

983
01:14:35,583 --> 01:14:37,375
You don't think I'm going to
give you what you want

984
01:14:37,458 --> 01:14:38,791
without seeing what you've got, do you?

985
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:41,666
You don't think I'm gonna get it out here
and show you, do you?

986
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:43,666
Well, there might be something missing.

987
01:14:43,750 --> 01:14:46,791
- There wasn't this morning.
- How am I supposed to know that?

988
01:14:46,875 --> 01:14:48,333
What kind of a sucker do you take me for?

989
01:14:48,416 --> 01:14:51,916
Anyway, I'm not doing anything
until I see what you've got.

990
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,875
<i>Don't want no mail order thing</i>

991
01:14:54,958 --> 01:14:58,375
<i>And give me the real, real thing</i>

992
01:14:58,458 --> 01:15:00,125
<i>Real thing</i>

993
01:15:00,208 --> 01:15:02,250
Supposing somebody sees?

994
01:15:03,583 --> 01:15:06,333
Get it out under the table.
Just a quick flash.

995
01:15:06,416 --> 01:15:08,750
All right, I will if you will.

996
01:15:08,833 --> 01:15:10,375
<i>Don't want no mail order thing</i>

997
01:15:10,458 --> 01:15:12,333
<i>And give me the real, real thing</i>

998
01:15:12,416 --> 01:15:15,791
Just a quick glimpse, that's all you're
getting, and then I want those negatives.

999
01:15:15,875 --> 01:15:19,625
- What negatives?
- The negatives I'm supposed to be buying.

1000
01:15:19,708 --> 01:15:22,500
I'll buy you anything
if you'll come back to my place.

1001
01:15:44,625 --> 01:15:47,791
Thank you. No, that's fine.
I'll be fine. Really.

1002
01:15:59,458 --> 01:16:01,958
- Hi there.
- Hi.

1003
01:16:04,208 --> 01:16:06,916
Look, I expect you're wondering
what I'm doing behind the curtain,

1004
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,208
- dressed like this, but...
- It happens all the time.

1005
01:16:09,291 --> 01:16:12,583
- Autograph hunters, they'll try anything.
- No, no.

1006
01:16:12,666 --> 01:16:15,333
Look, I'm a private detective.

1007
01:16:15,416 --> 01:16:17,458
- I've come to...
- You're the guy Rosco's looking for?

1008
01:16:17,541 --> 01:16:20,000
- Shh.
- Isn't this terrific?

1009
01:16:20,083 --> 01:16:25,125
You know, ever since I was a little girl,
I've had secret fantasies about dicks.

1010
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:29,125
Are you here to investigate
the boss's illegal activities?

1011
01:16:29,208 --> 01:16:30,666
No, no, no. Nothing like that.

1012
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:32,750
You don't know what you're missing.

1013
01:16:32,833 --> 01:16:37,083
I'm engaged to his son, Legs Luigi.
Oh, Lisa Moroni, by the way.

1014
01:16:37,166 --> 01:16:39,916
You've probably heard of me.
I'm an international superstar.

1015
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,416
What did you say your name was?

1016
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:45,541
- Blake. Judd Blake.
- Judd Blake?

1017
01:16:45,625 --> 01:16:48,333
- Yeah.
- The Judd Blake?

1018
01:16:50,333 --> 01:16:53,041
- Yeah.
- Oh, that is terrific.

1019
01:16:53,125 --> 01:16:56,208
Listen. What are you investigating?
Murder, blackmail?

1020
01:16:56,291 --> 01:16:57,541
Murder and blackmail.

1021
01:16:57,625 --> 01:17:00,375
Well, that's terrific. How can I help you?

1022
01:17:00,458 --> 01:17:04,083
Well, for a start,
you could get me out of here.

1023
01:17:04,166 --> 01:17:05,750
I've got an idea.

1024
01:17:08,583 --> 01:17:11,916
Okay, fellows, could you just
bring it in here? Be very careful.

1025
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,208
There are valuable things in it.
Place it down.

1026
01:17:15,291 --> 01:17:18,458
That's beautiful. Thank you, fellows,
thank you. Okay.

1027
01:17:28,333 --> 01:17:31,666
- Where are we?
- This is my place.

1028
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:34,958
- You okay?
- I've gone all stiff.

1029
01:17:35,041 --> 01:17:38,458
- Really?
- Look, I'm...

1030
01:17:38,541 --> 01:17:40,541
I'm very grateful to you for helping me
to get out.

1031
01:17:40,625 --> 01:17:45,416
Listen, it's nothing.
You can show your gratitude later.

1032
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:49,916
Maybe you'd care to take a shower, huh?
The bathroom's through there.

1033
01:17:52,583 --> 01:17:55,000
I'll fix us a couple of drinks.

1034
01:17:56,958 --> 01:17:58,416
All right.

1035
01:18:08,375 --> 01:18:10,791
I can't stay too long.

1036
01:18:10,875 --> 01:18:14,250
I've got to get back so as I can
finish off solving the case I'm on.

1037
01:18:14,333 --> 01:18:17,250
So what's a couple of hours?

1038
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:23,875
Terrific.

1039
01:18:25,375 --> 01:18:27,041
Drink?

1040
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:33,916
Thanks.

1041
01:18:42,416 --> 01:18:44,375
- Legs.
- Bugsy. What are you doing here, huh?

1042
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:46,625
You been with my Lisa?
I kill you, I kill you.

1043
01:18:46,708 --> 01:18:50,000
We just took some costumes
up to her apartment, that's all.

1044
01:18:50,083 --> 01:18:53,125
- How do I know you tell me the truth?
- On my mother's grave, I swear it.

1045
01:18:53,208 --> 01:18:55,583
Your mother is not even dead.

1046
01:18:55,666 --> 01:18:58,208
So is that my fault?

1047
01:18:58,291 --> 01:19:00,541
Nobody makes a fool of Legs Luigi.

1048
01:19:00,625 --> 01:19:03,666
The one thing I don't like is
other men being with my Lisa.

1049
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:07,833
They start getting ideas.
Usually the ones that she gives them.

1050
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:16,541
<i>I'm Moroni with an Iy</i>

1051
01:19:16,625 --> 01:19:18,208
<i>Not Moroni with an Ey</i>

1052
01:19:18,291 --> 01:19:21,083
<i>'Cause Moroni with an E means morony</i>

1053
01:19:24,375 --> 01:19:27,333
Right, you two stand guard here, huh?

1054
01:19:29,666 --> 01:19:31,583
Surprise, surprise.

1055
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,708
Lisa, it's me, your little Legs.

1056
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:43,583
Lisa? Hey, Lisa, open the door. Lisa?

1057
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,041
Legs, fancy you coming round.

1058
01:19:47,125 --> 01:19:49,375
- Who is in the shower?
- Oh, no one.

1059
01:19:49,458 --> 01:19:52,208
I don't believe you.
There's somebody in the shower.

1060
01:19:52,291 --> 01:19:54,500
I was running
that shower for myself.

1061
01:19:54,875 --> 01:19:57,666
How come the door,
she is locked from the inside, huh?

1062
01:19:57,750 --> 01:20:00,375
You know what these doors are like,
they're always sticking.

1063
01:20:06,833 --> 01:20:08,750
See?

1064
01:20:08,833 --> 01:20:11,208
Oh, Legs! Legs, my darling.

1065
01:20:16,833 --> 01:20:19,833
- Oh, Legs.
- Lisa.

1066
01:20:19,916 --> 01:20:22,416
I got some flowers for you, huh.

1067
01:20:23,541 --> 01:20:26,458
These are men's clothes.
What are they doing here, huh?

1068
01:20:26,541 --> 01:20:29,375
- Costumes.
- Costumes?

1069
01:20:29,458 --> 01:20:32,333
Yeah, for a new number
I've been rehearsing.

1070
01:20:32,416 --> 01:20:34,125
<i>Follow the yellow brick road, ha-ha</i>

1071
01:20:34,208 --> 01:20:38,625
Costumes, huh? You've got somebody
in here. A man, yes? Where is he?

1072
01:20:38,708 --> 01:20:42,000
You know, you can really be a jerk
sometimes. You're so jealous!

1073
01:20:42,083 --> 01:20:44,666
Mamma mia, I kill him, I kill him.
Where is he, huh?

1074
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:47,708
Legs... Legs, don't be...
Legs! Legs, listen.

1075
01:20:50,291 --> 01:20:52,750
- Legs, there is nobody here. Really.
- Hiding in the wardrobe?

1076
01:20:52,833 --> 01:20:55,500
- Really, Legs.
- He must be here.

1077
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:57,875
No. There isn't, Legs.

1078
01:20:59,083 --> 01:21:01,041
- There is no one here.
- Under the bed, huh?

1079
01:21:01,125 --> 01:21:02,208
- Legs.
- Under the bed.

1080
01:21:02,291 --> 01:21:05,708
- No, nobody under the bed.
- If I get him, I kill him.

1081
01:21:05,791 --> 01:21:07,750
Under the bed, huh?

1082
01:21:09,666 --> 01:21:11,750
- Or behind the curtains.
- Jesus Christ.

1083
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:17,583
A-ha!

1084
01:21:17,666 --> 01:21:19,708
Behind the curtains, huh?

1085
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:28,458
You're laughing at your little Legs, huh?
You think I'm stupid, huh?

1086
01:21:28,541 --> 01:21:32,041
Well, I tell you.
Nobody laughs at Legs Luigi.

1087
01:21:35,666 --> 01:21:38,708
Legs, why don't we just have a drink, huh?

1088
01:21:38,791 --> 01:21:42,958
- Right. Then I rip your knickers off, huh?
- Terrific.

1089
01:21:43,041 --> 01:21:46,500
I'll hang up the coat
and you get the drinks, huh?

1090
01:21:46,583 --> 01:21:51,375
You say no. No, I tell you. You get
the drinks, I put the jacket away.

1091
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:56,291
What do you think I am? Stupid?

1092
01:21:56,375 --> 01:21:59,666
Nobody makes a fool of Legs Luigi. Nobody.

1093
01:22:15,208 --> 01:22:19,958
Nobody makes a fool of Legs Luigi.
Nobody makes a fool...

1094
01:22:20,041 --> 01:22:21,916
Hey, Legs, I got a better idea.

1095
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,875
Why don't we just skip the drinks
and do the knickers bit instead, huh?

1096
01:22:24,958 --> 01:22:28,541
Sounds like a good idea. What you doing,
huh? You spoil the buttons on my shirt.

1097
01:22:28,625 --> 01:22:33,125
Don't be so silly, darling.
Don't you know I'm so divinely decadent.

1098
01:22:33,208 --> 01:22:36,375
- Okay, Valentino. Hit it!
- Oh, Lisa, my darling.

1099
01:23:06,458 --> 01:23:09,750
It's no good.
Something must have happened.

1100
01:23:09,833 --> 01:23:11,750
Otherwise he wouldn't have
stayed out all night.

1101
01:23:11,833 --> 01:23:14,625
- You know what he's like.
- Yes, that's what worries me.

1102
01:23:14,708 --> 01:23:17,958
Well, maybe he found out
who the blackmailer was and got held up.

1103
01:23:18,041 --> 01:23:22,083
Maybe he's found out who the blackmailer
is and got himself murdered.

1104
01:23:22,166 --> 01:23:24,958
- No, I'll have to go and get the police.
- You going to phone them?

1105
01:23:25,041 --> 01:23:26,250
No, somebody might hear me,

1106
01:23:26,333 --> 01:23:27,958
and that somebody
might be the blackmailer.

1107
01:23:28,041 --> 01:23:31,833
- Do you want me to come with you?
- No, you stay here in case he comes back.

1108
01:23:33,416 --> 01:23:36,666
I just hope he won't be too hurt
when he finds out about us.

1109
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:39,166
It could break his heart.

1110
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:42,541
I have that effect on men, you know.

1111
01:23:42,625 --> 01:23:43,916
I'll go and get the police.

1112
01:23:45,916 --> 01:23:47,333
Morning, Craddock. Blake in?

1113
01:23:47,416 --> 01:23:50,625
I haven't seen him, sir.
He's probably upstairs in his room.

1114
01:23:50,708 --> 01:23:52,250
Right.

1115
01:23:52,333 --> 01:23:54,958
I've got something really good here.

1116
01:23:59,916 --> 01:24:02,166
- Haven't you ever heard of knocking?
- Oh, no!

1117
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:03,666
You miss more scoops that way.

1118
01:24:03,750 --> 01:24:06,250
Yes, well you're not going
to have one of me starkers for a start.

1119
01:24:06,333 --> 01:24:07,791
This is slightly more important.

1120
01:24:07,875 --> 01:24:10,375
Right, where's Judd?
I want to show him this.

1121
01:24:10,458 --> 01:24:12,708
I was thumbing through the back issues
of the newspaper last night

1122
01:24:12,791 --> 01:24:13,958
and I found it.

1123
01:24:14,041 --> 01:24:15,125
What about it?

1124
01:24:15,208 --> 01:24:17,541
Well, look at it!
Look at the photo of the regatta.

1125
01:24:17,625 --> 01:24:19,541
Who is standing there?

1126
01:24:20,916 --> 01:24:22,458
Can't see a thing without my glasses.
Hang on.

1127
01:24:22,541 --> 01:24:25,500
It's that bloke who was murdered,
Scott Radleigh.

1128
01:24:25,583 --> 01:24:28,875
Can you see who he's standing next to?

1129
01:24:28,958 --> 01:24:31,791
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, yes.

1130
01:24:31,875 --> 01:24:33,916
Now my deal is this.

1131
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,083
I wont take this to the police,

1132
01:24:37,166 --> 01:24:40,375
if Judd will give us an exclusive on
whatever it is he's up to at the moment.

1133
01:24:40,458 --> 01:24:43,083
- Conniving little sod, aren't you?
- Yeah.

1134
01:24:43,166 --> 01:24:44,625
Where's Judd then?

1135
01:24:44,708 --> 01:24:46,291
That's what we'd all like to know.

1136
01:24:50,333 --> 01:24:52,416
Lisa.

1137
01:24:55,541 --> 01:24:56,750
Lisa.

1138
01:25:21,375 --> 01:25:22,708
- I'm freez...
- Shh!

1139
01:25:30,041 --> 01:25:32,125
Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1140
01:25:33,958 --> 01:25:36,125
- Oh, no, please.
- Oh, my!

1141
01:25:36,625 --> 01:25:38,833
- No, please.
- Say your prayers, my friend.

1142
01:25:38,916 --> 01:25:40,375
No, no, please. Please!

1143
01:25:40,458 --> 01:25:42,916
I'll cut you into little pieces!

1144
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
No, listen...

1145
01:25:45,166 --> 01:25:47,000
Couldn't we talk this over?

1146
01:25:49,708 --> 01:25:51,208
No, please.

1147
01:26:01,458 --> 01:26:03,916
Isn't it terrible? He just fainted.

1148
01:26:10,458 --> 01:26:12,083
Oh, terrific!

1149
01:26:12,208 --> 01:26:13,375
Shit!

1150
01:26:40,791 --> 01:26:42,083
Shalom.

1151
01:27:45,625 --> 01:27:47,666
Mr. Purdy. Purdy & Purdy, Solicitors.

1152
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:51,000
Ah, yes. You were expected, sir.

1153
01:27:51,083 --> 01:27:54,291
If you could assemble everyone together
so that I can dispose of this business

1154
01:27:54,375 --> 01:27:58,291
of the late Mr. Ashley Dotrice's will
and hand over the estate accordingly.

1155
01:27:58,375 --> 01:27:59,708
Most definitely, sir.

1156
01:27:59,791 --> 01:28:03,333
- Have you seen Miss Sutton anywhere about?
- I believe she went to the stables.

1157
01:28:03,416 --> 01:28:04,708
Come on.

1158
01:28:19,375 --> 01:28:21,291
Here! You're supposed to be dead.

1159
01:28:21,375 --> 01:28:22,375
Sorry to disappoint you, love.

1160
01:28:22,458 --> 01:28:25,416
I discharged myself
from hospital this morning.

1161
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:27,291
- You haven't got the money, have you?
- It's in the house.

1162
01:28:27,375 --> 01:28:29,291
So are the negatives, with my partner,

1163
01:28:29,375 --> 01:28:32,000
who should be handing them
over to Mr. Purdy any minute now.

1164
01:28:32,083 --> 01:28:33,916
Looks like you've lost the estate,
doesn't it, darling?

1165
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,375
Oh, no, it doesn't.

1166
01:28:35,458 --> 01:28:37,750
You see, we happen to know
who your partner is.

1167
01:28:37,833 --> 01:28:40,458
- You're bluffing.
- Show him, Wilfred.

1168
01:28:41,916 --> 01:28:43,875
Listen,
if I don't turn up inside that house

1169
01:28:43,958 --> 01:28:45,916
in the next few minutes
to say you've paid up,

1170
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,416
Purdy will get those negatives.

1171
01:28:49,541 --> 01:28:51,916
What you going to do, darling? Shoot us?

1172
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,958
You weren't very successful last time,
were you?

1173
01:28:54,041 --> 01:28:56,083
This time I'll make sure.

1174
01:28:59,541 --> 01:29:01,833
I never did like
the look of her from the start.

1175
01:30:28,041 --> 01:30:29,875
Hey!

1176
01:30:58,958 --> 01:31:02,041
Look, I'm sorry about your car,
love, but...

1177
01:31:38,541 --> 01:31:41,708
- I can't get the key out.
- Stand back. Let me.

1178
01:32:02,750 --> 01:32:04,791
These terms named Miss Laura Sutton

1179
01:32:04,875 --> 01:32:08,583
as sole heir to his
whole estate and fortune.

1180
01:32:08,666 --> 01:32:12,458
And this inheritance is to take place
at 12 noon today,

1181
01:32:12,541 --> 01:32:14,291
- on the 25th of this month...
- It was her!

1182
01:32:14,375 --> 01:32:17,000
Shut not thy merciful ears to our prayer,

1183
01:32:17,083 --> 01:32:19,375
but spare us, Lord most holy,
O God most mighty.

1184
01:32:20,666 --> 01:32:23,791
O holy and merciful savior, thou...

1185
01:32:29,333 --> 01:32:33,833
Thou most worthy judge eternal, suffer us
not at our last hour for any pains of...

1186
01:32:33,916 --> 01:32:35,625
Where am I?

1187
01:32:35,708 --> 01:32:38,208
Here, give us a hand...

1188
01:33:31,666 --> 01:33:32,791
Brakes!

1189
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:49,458
Amateur, Robert, amateur.

1190
01:33:49,541 --> 01:33:51,500
I did almost solve it.

1191
01:33:55,958 --> 01:33:58,750
You shouldn't have been solving anything.

1192
01:33:58,833 --> 01:34:01,833
A little slower and a little lower please,
Miss Walker.

1193
01:34:01,916 --> 01:34:03,958
Don't be too hard on him, Mr. Blake.

1194
01:34:04,041 --> 01:34:06,541
After all, everything has worked out
all right in the end.

1195
01:34:06,625 --> 01:34:08,583
Maud and I are getting engaged.

1196
01:34:08,666 --> 01:34:10,625
The estate going to the two daughters,
as it should.

1197
01:34:10,708 --> 01:34:12,208
Radleigh and Clarissa
inside for blackmail,

1198
01:34:12,291 --> 01:34:13,916
and Laura for attempted murder.

1199
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:17,541
Yes, I never did like the look of her
from the start.

1200
01:34:17,625 --> 01:34:19,541
There's one thing
I don't quite understand.

1201
01:34:19,625 --> 01:34:22,458
Who was it that Bob was suppose to meet
in the club that night?

1202
01:34:22,541 --> 01:34:25,375
Somebody Clarissa or Scott would have
sent along to do the pick-up.

1203
01:34:25,458 --> 01:34:27,583
It's very simple.
In fact, from the sound of it,

1204
01:34:27,666 --> 01:34:30,666
the whole case was pretty obvious
from the start.

1205
01:34:30,750 --> 01:34:33,666
Yeah. Well, I nearly got it right.

1206
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:35,625
Yes, well, you don't become
a famous detective

1207
01:34:35,708 --> 01:34:37,208
by nearly getting things right, Robert.

1208
01:34:37,291 --> 01:34:39,458
But I had suspects.
I'm very good at suspects.

1209
01:34:39,541 --> 01:34:42,250
I think you should be grateful
I haven't decided to fire you.

1210
01:34:42,333 --> 01:34:44,083
I am, Mr. Blake.

1211
01:34:44,166 --> 01:34:47,541
Good, then how would you like
to crack a case for me?

1212
01:34:47,625 --> 01:34:48,875
Really?

1213
01:34:52,541 --> 01:34:55,333
What kind of case is it, Mr. Blake?

1214
01:34:55,416 --> 01:34:59,875
A case of champagne to celebrate
that young couple's happy engagement.

1215
01:35:39,875 --> 01:35:42,541
<i>Calling all cars
It's a quarter to three</i>

1216
01:35:42,625 --> 01:35:45,375
<i>There's nobody home and it's worrying me</i>

1217
01:35:45,458 --> 01:35:49,583
<i>It goes without saying
that she's only playing with me</i>

1218
01:35:53,791 --> 01:35:58,458
<i>And I'm losing sleep
'cause I've got to keep my eye on you</i>

1219
01:36:00,125 --> 01:36:05,000
<i>You've been double-dealing
left and right</i>

1220
01:36:05,833 --> 01:36:10,291
<i>You're at home but you're not alone
and I know that's true</i>

1221
01:36:11,416 --> 01:36:14,083
<i>I've got information from</i>

1222
01:36:14,625 --> 01:36:19,583
<i>Information from my private eye</i>

1223
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:40,541
<i>Information from</i>

1224
01:36:41,083 --> 01:36:44,375
<i>Information from my private eye</i>
