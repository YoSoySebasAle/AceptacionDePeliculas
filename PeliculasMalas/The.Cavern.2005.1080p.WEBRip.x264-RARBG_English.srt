1
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:22,983
We got it.

2
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,252
Yeah.

3
00:01:24,352 --> 00:01:25,519
Come on, let's do it.

4
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,321
- Oh, my God!
- Pack it up.

5
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:30,090
Tear down.
We're heading to Asia.

6
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:48,108
- Hey. Hey, how close are we?
- No problem.

7
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:50,278
No, how close are we?

8
00:01:50,378 --> 00:01:52,646
I say, "No problem."

9
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:55,115
He said, "No problem."

10
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:57,518
Great.

11
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:03,924
Hey, man,
do you have to go so fast?

12
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:05,493
Yeah!

13
00:02:05,593 --> 00:02:06,494
Why?

14
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:07,828
I don't wanna
lose to my brother.

15
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:09,062
Wonderful!

16
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:10,598
Okay, are you trying
to ram us out?

17
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:33,254
Finally.

18
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:36,257
Amazing!

19
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:38,492
Yeah.

20
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:46,534
Load up your packs.

21
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:49,270
It's gonna be a walk
the rest of the way.

22
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,217
What do you need those for?

23
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:04,452
Need what?

24
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:07,421
- The gun.
- Safety.

25
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,657
You don't go in the middle
of nowhere unprotected, man.

26
00:03:09,757 --> 00:03:12,960
- Who is this guy?
- Hey, where are we exactly?

27
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:14,962
No name.

28
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:16,063
No name?

29
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:17,498
Virgin territory.

30
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:19,032
This area
hasn't been mapped yet.

31
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,501
It's officially unexplored.

32
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:24,137
We're hundreds of miles
in the middle of nowhere.

33
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:25,339
So who else knows we're here?

34
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,275
You're looking at us.

35
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:32,313
Secrets travel fast
in the caving world.

36
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:35,683
How many years
you say you been caving?

37
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:37,318
Seven.

38
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,187
Yeah.

39
00:03:40,288 --> 00:03:41,689
Lying bitch.

40
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,492
What?

41
00:03:57,805 --> 00:03:59,340
There it is.

42
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,345
Hello!

43
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:16,384
Why?

44
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:19,152
Why not?

45
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:21,489
For an opening this big,
there should be enough light

46
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:22,890
to see further inside.

47
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,191
Yeah.

48
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,693
I've never seen
anything like it before.

49
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:27,961
Yeah, it's weird.

50
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,232
It's late.

51
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,701
The shadows are playing
with our eyes.

52
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,603
I'll set up the flashes
and we'll snap off a couple.

53
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:38,271
No, no, no.
We set up camp 20 yards back.

54
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:39,507
We'll cave in the morning.

55
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:40,808
It'll take, like, two minutes.

56
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:42,510
Nothing does.

57
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,546
Set up camp.
We'll cave tomorrow.

58
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,683
Jackass.

59
00:05:55,423 --> 00:05:56,524
Good to know.

60
00:05:56,624 --> 00:05:58,992
Suck it.
You're so...

61
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:03,764
You want me to shove it
up my ass, I'll tell you no!

62
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:07,568
I can do all kinds of things
with this right now,

63
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:10,938
but shove it up my ass?
That's where I draw the line.

64
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:16,744
That's a whole
new ball game.

65
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,414
In Sarajevo,
we take it up the butt.

66
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:22,516
Every day.

67
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,952
He's in slow motion.

68
00:06:29,423 --> 00:06:30,891
We call her Florence.

69
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,693
What? Like Nightingale?

70
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:33,561
Yeah.

71
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:35,228
- Why?
- Okay, stop!

72
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:39,867
Because on her first caving expedition,
someone got hurt.

73
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:45,506
So this guy cuts himself
on his knee.

74
00:06:45,606 --> 00:06:47,107
Oh, wait.
It wasn't just a cut.

75
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:52,580
No, no, no. You're right.
It was a tiny cut.

76
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,314
Tiny.

77
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,549
Oh, you bitch!

78
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:57,050
But Florence here

79
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,687
decides that she was
going to wrap it,

80
00:06:59,787 --> 00:07:03,390
and wrapped it, and, yes,
you may have guessed it,

81
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:05,358
she wrapped it again.
You bitch!

82
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:13,467
But seriously,
I'd love to lead my own cave expedition.

83
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,503
Of children?

84
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:17,838
Of grown-ups.

85
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,407
Be the first to explore
a new cave.

86
00:07:20,508 --> 00:07:22,710
It'd be amazing.

87
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,513
Certainly have a lot more
fun than those guys.

88
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:27,347
Especially Gannon.

89
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,652
How long has it been?

90
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:34,254
Two years tomorrow.

91
00:07:34,354 --> 00:07:36,490
Yeah, that's what changed him.

92
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:43,664
What do you mean?
What happened?

93
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,105
It--It won't go in the book.

94
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:55,576
If I tell you,
you're gonna wanna put it in.

95
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,845
It won't.

96
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,848
You've got my word.

97
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,390
Do you guys know?

98
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,491
No.

99
00:08:11,592 --> 00:08:13,894
We meet Gannon today.

100
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:20,133
All right, Ori,
you can trust me.

101
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,777
Two years ago,
we were caving in Peru.

102
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:36,584
Me, Miranda,
Bailey, Domingo, Gannon...

103
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:38,418
There were some
other guys there,

104
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,988
but they don't
work for us anymore.

105
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:45,959
And there was
another woman, Rachel,

106
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:49,529
his fiancée.

107
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:56,169
It was the beginning
of the rainy season in Peru,

108
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,539
and we were trying to get out

109
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,009
of a cave that was flooding.

110
00:09:09,817 --> 00:09:12,052
And she didn't make it.

111
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:23,163
We were all, you know,
really close to her.

112
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,705
I'm sorry.

113
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:35,709
Yeah. Gannon was the only one
that saw her die.

114
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:39,680
Her body was never found.

115
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,949
Are you saying
there's more to the story?

116
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:42,816
No.

117
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,417
Then what are you saying?

118
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,186
Nothing.

119
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:47,888
That's it.

120
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,362
Well, I'm gonna go to bed.

121
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:57,030
Me, too.

122
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,905
Get some sleep.

123
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,293
So,

124
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:30,864
you guys thinking
about tomorrow?

125
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,233
You getting what you need
for your book?

126
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,669
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

127
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:38,405
Caving is a whole new world.

128
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:42,575
For a lot of people, I mean.

129
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:44,277
I mean, you know,
you show them a photo,

130
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,747
it opens them up to
a whole new universe, right?

131
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:50,017
Every photo you sell
furthers caving.

132
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,152
Yeah.

133
00:10:52,252 --> 00:10:54,855
We're lucky to be
making a living doing it.

134
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:58,992
So... So what are
your thoughts, exactly,

135
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:01,394
on caving?

136
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,696
What do you mean?

137
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,331
I mean,
what's your philosophy?

138
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:05,866
How do you approach it?

139
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:09,436
I wanna know what makes you go down there.

140
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:16,944
There's something
about caves that's alive.

141
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:21,614
There's something down there that,
if we're open to it,

142
00:11:21,715 --> 00:11:24,217
we can connect with.

143
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:27,654
I look for that connection
every time I go down.

144
00:11:27,755 --> 00:11:29,389
I crave it.

145
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,425
You're a Brujo.

146
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:38,065
His father was.

147
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,633
So you believe in spirits?

148
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:42,669
Like, spirit of the earth,
spirit of the sun?

149
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:43,804
Yeah, I do.

150
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:45,472
And cave spirits?

151
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,474
The most unpredictable of all.

152
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,145
Interesting.

153
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:54,748
Everyone has
their own beliefs.

154
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:57,217
What's hanging
from your neck?

155
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:00,453
It's a cross.

156
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,989
If something as magnificent

157
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:05,325
or as terrible as God
is possible,

158
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,327
anything is, right?

159
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:10,063
Right?

160
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:14,734
- Yeah, but I wasn't saying...
- Throughout history,

161
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:16,536
caves have been a sacred place

162
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:19,172
for almost every religion
in existence.

163
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:24,744
Remember, Jesus was buried
and resurrected in a cave.

164
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,420
I'm sorry.
I wasn't trying to offend you.

165
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,994
So why do you do it?

166
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,196
We haven't found them all.

167
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:46,333
Everyone knows where
the highest mountains are,

168
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,169
the deepest seas.

169
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:52,873
But caves...

170
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:56,776
Caves are the last unexplored frontier on earth.

171
00:12:58,045 --> 00:13:01,048
There's nothing more
exciting than that.

172
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:03,383
My grandfather used
to climb through caves

173
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:07,120
to find new mining lines
on the East Coast.

174
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:12,259
He'd say,
"Apollo had it easy,

175
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:15,395
"'cause everyone knows
where the moon is.

176
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:18,165
"But no one knows
where I'm going."

177
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,405
So are there any events

178
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:31,078
or anything about
caving that you regret?

179
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:47,360
Over the years, I've found

180
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,398
that it's hard to control
what happens down there.

181
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:55,402
It's a beast, and not
all beasts can be tamed.

182
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:59,372
And that's what
you need to understand.

183
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:04,144
Things happen in caves that don't happen anywhere else.

184
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:07,948
When you're down there,
you're in darkness,

185
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:13,453
an eternal,
never-ending world of night.

186
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:18,558
Down there, miles beneath
the earth's surface,

187
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:22,195
you're surrounded
by miles of rock.

188
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:27,367
You know a wrong step
can send you down a chasm

189
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,069
hundreds of feet deep?

190
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:32,072
And if you get
hurt down there,

191
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:35,542
maybe break an arm
or break a leg,

192
00:14:35,642 --> 00:14:40,880
there's no ambulance nearby,
no hospital.

193
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:46,753
Chances are you won't be
brought out alive.

194
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:51,424
The only way to survive it over and over is to respect it.

195
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:55,228
Respect where you are.

196
00:14:56,863 --> 00:15:00,333
Respect what it is.

197
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:16,216
Bailey. Bailey.

198
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:19,219
Hold on, I'm coming.

199
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:21,088
- Is everyone asleep?
- Yeah.

200
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:22,822
Come on, it'll be fun.

201
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,059
Stop!

202
00:15:51,718 --> 00:15:54,221
Wait. What was that?

203
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:01,428
Bat?

204
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:15,575
Stop. It's not a fucking bat.

205
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:18,511
Say "fuck" like that again.

206
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:21,648
There's something there.

207
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:34,394
You're just worried
about getting caught.

208
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,600
It isn't fun
if you don't get caught.

209
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,001
How you feeling?

210
00:17:15,102 --> 00:17:17,070
Fine. You?

211
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,738
Ready to go.

212
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:20,607
Again.

213
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:22,309
Too bad.

214
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:50,403
Hey.

215
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:56,576
It was today.

216
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,380
You gonna be okay?

217
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:02,582
Yeah.

218
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:04,551
I'll be fine.

219
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:06,119
Good.

220
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,758
I'm glad you're here.

221
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:13,426
I know.

222
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:18,498
I know.

223
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:23,870
Come on.

224
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,222
How'd it go?

225
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:47,126
We're about to find out.

226
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:49,196
All right!

227
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:50,697
We ready?

228
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,499
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

229
00:19:06,946 --> 00:19:08,181
Let's go.

230
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,787
Hold up.

231
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:42,675
It's a long way down.

232
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:44,176
Yeah.

233
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:47,380
Hey, set up a rappel line.

234
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,249
So what are we gonna
name this one?

235
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,218
Hell's Pit.

236
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:54,687
Do we really wanna
name it that?

237
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,057
What?

238
00:20:58,157 --> 00:21:00,259
It's the Russian word
for "hell."

239
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,964
Then Ad's Pit it is.

240
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:06,566
Estupidos. Ready.

241
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,735
- All right. All right,
- I'll head down first.

242
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:10,837
Whoa, whoa. How come
you get all the booty?

243
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,405
'Cause I say so.

244
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:37,764
Shit!

245
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:39,499
- What's up?
- You okay?

246
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:42,101
- Hey, you all right?
- Gannon!

247
00:21:42,201 --> 00:21:44,003
Yeah, I'm fine!

248
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,703
You bitch.

249
00:22:27,246 --> 00:22:28,748
Off-rope!

250
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,417
What do we got down here?

251
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:31,918
It used to be
some sort of water funnel,

252
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:33,820
and the water
drained in from above

253
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,989
and funneled out of these
passageways here.

254
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:45,064
- I got you.
- I have it.

255
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:46,265
Okay.

256
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,600
All right,
I'll set up the flashes.

257
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,436
- No, we'll keep going.
- Off-rope!

258
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:52,104
We can take pictures of this
when we get back.

259
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:00,780
Off-rope.

260
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,124
Off-rope.

261
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,107
Ah.

262
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:30,710
I'm done. What?

263
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:42,855
He hear us.

264
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:44,691
Good. Let's, um...

265
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,193
Whoa. What's going on?

266
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:50,563
What is this?

267
00:23:51,631 --> 00:23:53,500
Never seen that before.

268
00:23:59,005 --> 00:24:01,574
Magnetic plate?

269
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:04,911
Hey, we all have backup lights,
so we'll keep our eye on it.

270
00:24:05,011 --> 00:24:06,078
Let's cave.

271
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,747
All right.

272
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:37,970
We got drippers here.

273
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,739
The water
must have funneled out

274
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:42,575
from the main chamber
at Ad's Pit into here.

275
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:45,211
Either that or
we're underneath a lake.

276
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:47,179
We should listen
for water, guys.

277
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,581
Let's pull right.

278
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:51,350
How about we go straight?

279
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,820
How about we go straight?

280
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,678
What the...

281
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:21,948
- This cave is creeped out.
- Yeah.

282
00:26:22,048 --> 00:26:24,250
Well, the wind means
there's more cave, so...

283
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,718
No.

284
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:28,287
The cave is moaning.

285
00:26:29,722 --> 00:26:31,724
It is making love.

286
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:35,461
And who's he doing,
Slava? You?

287
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:38,197
Me? No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

288
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:40,166
It is fucking you.

289
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:45,838
Sorry, guy.
I don't do Russian caves, eh?

290
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,574
Did you ever do
an American cave?

291
00:26:48,675 --> 00:26:52,144
Slava, you ever do
an American cave?

292
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:54,714
Hey, Slava!

293
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:07,694
He was right here.

294
00:27:40,426 --> 00:27:41,994
Vlad?

295
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,163
Vlad?

296
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:59,211
No, that's the wrong one.

297
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:02,314
That's where
the cord leads to.

298
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:03,582
We came out of that one.

299
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:04,683
Well, if the cord's
going down that hole,

300
00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:06,819
that's where we came from.

301
00:28:11,657 --> 00:28:14,193
She's right.
Footprint.

302
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:16,195
Well, then,
somebody moved the cord.

303
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:18,130
Or something.

304
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:41,087
Hold on, guys.

305
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,725
- Blood.
- Oh, my God!

306
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:49,061
Oh, shit.

307
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:52,932
Don't worry.

308
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:54,733
Calm down. Calm down!

309
00:28:54,834 --> 00:28:56,135
Shut up!

310
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,469
Come on.

311
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:38,544
Did you see that?

312
00:29:43,682 --> 00:29:45,151
What?

313
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:51,090
Slava?

314
00:29:51,824 --> 00:29:53,559
Come here.

315
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:58,297
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

316
00:29:58,397 --> 00:29:59,665
What the hell!

317
00:29:59,765 --> 00:30:01,800
What did this?
What did this, man?

318
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:05,704
Oh, shit!

319
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,539
Sit up! Sit up!

320
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:08,707
Okay. Hey.

321
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,142
Can you hear me?

322
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:11,978
What did this to you, man?
What did this?

323
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:14,280
There's not enough time!
We gotta get him out now!

324
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,481
Oh, shit!

325
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:16,748
We gotta get him out of here!

326
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,588
All right, all right.

327
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:24,756
Ori, lift him up.

328
00:30:24,857 --> 00:30:27,159
I'm moving
as fast as I can.

329
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:29,495
All right.
Hold on, Slava, we got you.

330
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:30,596
All right.

331
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:32,031
Come! Here!

332
00:30:32,131 --> 00:30:35,167
- Help me.
- Hang in there, Slava!

333
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:39,571
Vlad! Vlad!

334
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,073
- Vlad!
- Come on!

335
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:43,142
We need help down here! Vlad!

336
00:30:43,242 --> 00:30:45,544
- Gannon.
- What?

337
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:53,219
Shit! What is going on here?

338
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:55,154
We're fucked.

339
00:30:55,988 --> 00:30:57,924
We're fucked.

340
00:30:58,024 --> 00:30:59,959
What's that?

341
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,695
Hey, watch out!

342
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:35,894
Oh, my God.

343
00:32:00,886 --> 00:32:03,990
Oh, my God.

344
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,580
No one else knows
we're down here?

345
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,748
We're so fucked.

346
00:32:29,848 --> 00:32:31,317
Don't say that.

347
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:33,219
Does anybody else
know where we are?

348
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:34,853
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

349
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,455
- We're so fucked.
- Don't fucking say that.

350
00:32:36,555 --> 00:32:38,257
What, "we're fucked"?
'Cause we're fucked.

351
00:32:38,357 --> 00:32:40,326
Does anybody fucking know,
or are we stranded down here?

352
00:32:40,426 --> 00:32:42,294
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Just calm down, guys.

353
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:44,230
We got two fucking dead people lying on the floor,

354
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:46,032
and you want me to calm down?

355
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:47,366
We're gonna be okay.
We're stranded in here!

356
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,335
Calm down, y'all!
We're stranded down here.

357
00:32:49,435 --> 00:32:50,236
You guys, stop!

358
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:51,203
Will somebody answer me?

359
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,239
Just shut up, man.

360
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:56,742
Everybody shut up!

361
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:11,690
Now, calm yourselves down
and get control, okay?

362
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:17,296
Okay?

363
00:33:17,396 --> 00:33:18,797
Okay. Hey, we're all right.

364
00:33:18,897 --> 00:33:20,699
We're all right, okay?

365
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,202
Okay. Okay.

366
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:31,910
Gannon?

367
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,512
Yes.

368
00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:39,251
Gannon, we lost him.

369
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,822
What did this to him?

370
00:33:43,922 --> 00:33:45,557
An animal? A bear?

371
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:46,992
No.

372
00:33:47,093 --> 00:33:49,928
That--That wouldn't
explain the burns

373
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,297
or the way his intestines...

374
00:33:51,397 --> 00:33:54,700
No, I can't explain it.
I don't understand.

375
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,703
None of this is explainable
in physical terms.

376
00:33:57,803 --> 00:33:59,004
What the hell does that mean?

377
00:33:59,105 --> 00:34:00,839
Listen, we don't need that
right now, okay?

378
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:02,074
What does it mean,
huh?

379
00:34:02,174 --> 00:34:03,242
Hold on, hold on.
Stop it.

380
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:05,377
Will you calm down?

381
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:07,179
Yeah, can we worry
about what did this

382
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,248
after we find
a way out of here?

383
00:34:09,348 --> 00:34:11,617
He's right. We're not gonna
last too long down here

384
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:13,352
without any supplies.

385
00:34:14,086 --> 00:34:15,787
Um...

386
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,056
My battery's almost dead.

387
00:34:18,157 --> 00:34:19,791
- Me, too.
- Mine, too.

388
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,528
Weren't they supposed to last
longer than a couple of hours?

389
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:23,762
Yeah.

390
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:24,963
Half empty.

391
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,698
I know I charged them.

392
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,234
I know, man.

393
00:34:28,334 --> 00:34:30,702
There's some sort of energy drain going on down here.

394
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:33,405
Aren't they gonna last long enough for us to get out of here?

395
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:36,842
It could take days to find a new passage to the surface.

396
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:37,943
What's the plan?

397
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:40,078
We find another way
out of here.

398
00:34:40,946 --> 00:34:44,250
I'll lead.
Domingo, cover the rear.

399
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,618
We'll leave the bodies
for now.

400
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:49,087
Let's go!

401
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,813
What does
the air current mean?

402
00:35:14,913 --> 00:35:17,283
Caving for seven years, huh?

403
00:35:18,517 --> 00:35:20,219
Yeah.

404
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:22,721
Air currents mean
one of two things,

405
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:25,891
a surface route
or a deeper cave.

406
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:37,403
What's wrong?

407
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,338
Nothing.

408
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:42,241
It's gonna get
a little tight in here, guys.

409
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,087
Still
feeling that current?

410
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:57,823
Yeah.

411
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:08,834
How much rock is above us?

412
00:36:08,934 --> 00:36:10,736
Much.

413
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:12,204
How much?

414
00:36:12,304 --> 00:36:15,441
If we don't reach the surface,
you'll know.

415
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:17,709
Shut up, Domingo.

416
00:36:37,963 --> 00:36:41,533
Okay, looks like
we get a little more room.

417
00:36:46,505 --> 00:36:49,074
- Did you hear that?
- What?

418
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:51,610
Stop moving! Stop moving!

419
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:09,295
What the...

420
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:10,529
Holy shit.

421
00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:13,432
Don't make any noise.

422
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,348
Quiet.

423
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,922
Don't make any noise.

424
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,958
What are you doing?

425
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,532
What are you...
What are you doing?

426
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:48,500
Shut up! It's not working!

427
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,637
For fuck's sake,
what are you doing?

428
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,389
It sees us.

429
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:15,661
Go! Go!
Keep moving. Don't stop.

430
00:38:15,761 --> 00:38:16,528
Go, go, go, go!

431
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:17,896
Come on! Go, go, go!

432
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:20,332
Move, move, move!

433
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:23,569
Go, go, go, go!

434
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,837
Domingo!

435
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:30,075
Get up, man! Come on!

436
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:32,110
Move, move, move, move!

437
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:34,646
Come on. Come on.

438
00:38:47,893 --> 00:38:49,695
This cave

439
00:38:50,396 --> 00:38:52,063
has a soul.

440
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:04,443
Go! Go!

441
00:39:04,543 --> 00:39:06,845
Go, go! We gotta
get out of here, man!

442
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:08,447
Fuck! Move, move! Go!

443
00:39:08,547 --> 00:39:11,049
Oh, holy shit, it's coming!
Just get out!

444
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:12,884
Go! Go!

445
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:14,553
We gotta keep going.

446
00:39:14,653 --> 00:39:16,287
Go on! Get out of here!
Careful! Let's go!

447
00:39:16,388 --> 00:39:17,923
Go!

448
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:19,391
Move!

449
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:23,429
Let's move! Move!

450
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:26,765
Move, move, move!

451
00:39:32,337 --> 00:39:34,740
Okay, okay, okay.

452
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,175
What happened? What happened?

453
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,415
Gannon!

454
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,927
Oh, God.

455
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:57,395
Where are you hurt?

456
00:39:57,496 --> 00:39:59,364
Where are you hurt?
Where are you hurt?

457
00:39:59,465 --> 00:40:02,801
Not me. Domingo.

458
00:40:04,202 --> 00:40:06,204
It got him. He wouldn't run.

459
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:09,307
It's some kind of beast
or something.

460
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,577
Fuck you.
Why'd you run?

461
00:40:11,677 --> 00:40:14,680
- What?
- We left him there.

462
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,047
We didn't leave him.
He wouldn't run.

463
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:17,716
- Are you listening?
- We could've helped him.

464
00:40:17,816 --> 00:40:20,185
What are you talking about?
He was dead! Look at me!

465
00:40:20,285 --> 00:40:22,821
You were gonna leave
before anything happened.

466
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,222
We had to.

467
00:40:24,322 --> 00:40:26,792
This could have been
our blood.

468
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:30,996
That's the way it is.
It's you or him.

469
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:32,798
You or her.

470
00:40:32,898 --> 00:40:33,732
Her?

471
00:40:33,832 --> 00:40:36,334
Peru. Two years ago today.

472
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,669
Rachel.
You left her, too, remember?

473
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,204
You watched her drown.

474
00:40:39,304 --> 00:40:42,107
You saved yourself,
and you watched her drown!

475
00:40:42,207 --> 00:40:43,809
Gannon, stop it!

476
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:45,577
Stop it! Stop it!

477
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:47,613
Gannon, stop it. Stop!
Stop it.

478
00:40:47,713 --> 00:40:49,380
No, Gannon. No! No!

479
00:40:49,481 --> 00:40:50,549
Get off of him!

480
00:40:50,649 --> 00:40:52,350
- You hear that?
- No!

481
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,586
You better put that
in your book.

482
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:57,022
People should know
what this man did!

483
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:58,389
And it only gets better!

484
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,425
You weren't there!
You don't know what happened!

485
00:41:00,526 --> 00:41:01,660
Stop it!

486
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,929
Hey!
Shouldn't we keep moving?

487
00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:04,896
He's right!

488
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:06,364
We got us this
thing chasing us,

489
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,599
and you guys are fighting?

490
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:09,801
What is wrong with you?

491
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:15,607
Now, let's get moving.

492
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:21,913
This way.

493
00:41:57,883 --> 00:42:00,385
Come on.
This could take us to the top.

494
00:42:00,485 --> 00:42:02,120
Yes.

495
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:12,030
Come on.

496
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:20,305
Come on.

497
00:42:24,175 --> 00:42:26,211
- Oh, God.
- Fuck!

498
00:42:26,311 --> 00:42:29,280
What? What? No. No.

499
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,916
What?

500
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:33,518
- Fuck!
- No.

501
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:35,153
No.

502
00:42:37,923 --> 00:42:38,757
Fuck!

503
00:42:38,857 --> 00:42:41,827
Son of a bitch!
Fuck!

504
00:42:41,927 --> 00:42:46,097
Maybe if we backtrack and try
one of the other passages...

505
00:42:46,197 --> 00:42:47,365
Yeah, maybe.

506
00:42:47,465 --> 00:42:50,368
Go back? No, no, no, no, no.

507
00:42:50,468 --> 00:42:51,703
How thick is this wall here?

508
00:42:51,803 --> 00:42:53,038
It's thick, man.

509
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,373
Stop it!

510
00:42:55,473 --> 00:42:56,775
Don't you guys carry drills?

511
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:59,144
Yes.
What the fuck are you doing?

512
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:00,445
What are you doing?

513
00:43:00,545 --> 00:43:02,380
Drill a hole in the wall,
genius.

514
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,749
Ambrose, calm down.

515
00:43:03,849 --> 00:43:05,283
Drill a hole in the fucking wall.
Genius.

516
00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:06,484
Yeah,
knock yourself out.

517
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,986
Ambrose.

518
00:43:08,086 --> 00:43:09,655
Is this the longest bit
you have?

519
00:43:09,755 --> 00:43:10,789
Yeah, man.

520
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:13,625
Don't you have a longer bit?

521
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:16,361
I need a longer bit!

522
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:18,529
Stupid jerk!

523
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:21,066
Ambrose, stop drilling.

524
00:43:26,404 --> 00:43:29,107
Put the goddamn
drill down, boy!

525
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:32,143
Calm yourself down.

526
00:43:32,243 --> 00:43:35,180
Shit could be around
the corner any minute.

527
00:43:37,182 --> 00:43:40,752
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

528
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,989
It's okay. Relax.

529
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:47,859
Okay?
I only caved twice.

530
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:48,994
No shit.

531
00:43:49,094 --> 00:43:50,595
Hey.

532
00:43:50,696 --> 00:43:52,831
With tour groups.

533
00:43:55,734 --> 00:43:57,335
I'm sorry.

534
00:43:57,435 --> 00:43:59,537
It's okay. Hey.

535
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,639
I wanna get out!
I just wanna get out!

536
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,676
I just wanna get out of here!
- We're gonna get out! We're gonna get out!

537
00:44:04,776 --> 00:44:06,011
Ambrose, we're gonna get out.
- Shut up!

538
00:44:06,111 --> 00:44:08,446
We're gonna get out of here.

539
00:44:08,546 --> 00:44:12,784
But I really need you to pull yourself together right now, okay?

540
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:14,219
Okay?

541
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,787
Okay.

542
00:44:18,456 --> 00:44:20,325
I'm sorry.

543
00:44:20,425 --> 00:44:21,426
It's okay.

544
00:44:21,526 --> 00:44:23,795
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

545
00:44:23,895 --> 00:44:25,731
You're doing pretty great
for a virgin.

546
00:44:25,831 --> 00:44:27,766
Okay? Okay?

547
00:44:31,737 --> 00:44:34,239
Hey, guys,
we're running out of options.

548
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:41,646
Coming up
on that intersection.

549
00:44:41,747 --> 00:44:43,749
Well, maybe we should
turn off our lights.

550
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:45,917
I mean, that's how
it found us last time, right?

551
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:48,253
We're the only light source
in this hellhole.

552
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:50,455
If we turn them off,
it's not gonna know which tunnel to go down.

553
00:44:50,555 --> 00:44:52,157
- It's a one-in-four chance.
- I'll take those odds.

554
00:44:52,257 --> 00:44:55,260
- Everybody in agreement?
- Yeah.

555
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,162
Power down.

556
00:44:58,263 --> 00:44:59,865
- Back lights.
- Listen.

557
00:45:08,573 --> 00:45:10,275
Breathe quieter.

558
00:45:14,379 --> 00:45:15,446
Oh, God!

559
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:27,158
Oh, God!

560
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:28,459
Run!

561
00:45:30,195 --> 00:45:32,297
Don't leave me alone.

562
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:27,819
Hey, you okay? Come on!

563
00:46:27,919 --> 00:46:29,154
- Yeah, you?
- I'm fine.

564
00:46:29,254 --> 00:46:30,856
- Where's Ambrose?
- Come on!

565
00:46:30,956 --> 00:46:32,257
- Guys, stop. Where's Ambrose?
- He didn't make it.

566
00:46:32,357 --> 00:46:33,925
- He's gone?
- He didn't make it.

567
00:46:34,025 --> 00:46:35,460
- Oh, God!
- I didn't see what happened.

568
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,028
- He didn't make it. Go!
- You know what happened, okay?

569
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:39,330
We gotta keep moving.
Let's go!

570
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:40,465
Okay.

571
00:46:40,565 --> 00:46:42,567
Go! Go!
I got the bag. Go!

572
00:46:56,848 --> 00:46:59,117
Fuck! Fuck!

573
00:46:59,217 --> 00:47:00,986
Shut up. Shut up.

574
00:47:01,086 --> 00:47:02,720
Shut the fuck up.

575
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,822
Shut the fuck up!

576
00:47:04,923 --> 00:47:06,257
Come on, come on, come on.

577
00:47:06,357 --> 00:47:08,459
No, we're never gonna
get out of this place.

578
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,728
- There's no way out of here.
- There is.

579
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:11,963
Shut up!

580
00:47:12,063 --> 00:47:13,831
Just move, move, move!

581
00:47:13,932 --> 00:47:15,466
Coming through here.

582
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:16,868
Fuck!

583
00:47:16,968 --> 00:47:18,703
No, we're never gonna
get out of this place.

584
00:47:18,803 --> 00:47:20,038
Do you get it?

585
00:47:20,138 --> 00:47:22,607
Wait, wait.
I see a way out.

586
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:30,916
Oh, shit.

587
00:47:31,016 --> 00:47:32,617
I'm fine. I'm fine.

588
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,365
Go, go, go.

589
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,806
Gannon. Gannon, let's rest.

590
00:47:55,907 --> 00:47:58,944
No, we gotta keep going.
All right?

591
00:48:02,948 --> 00:48:04,615
Get your batteries.

592
00:48:07,352 --> 00:48:08,786
What's going on?

593
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,621
It's draining
our fucking batteries.

594
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:11,957
Wait a minute. Do that again.

595
00:48:12,057 --> 00:48:14,225
What?
Put your head by the wall.

596
00:48:15,026 --> 00:48:16,962
Pull it away.

597
00:48:18,196 --> 00:48:19,464
The cave's magnetic.

598
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:22,934
Yeah, but not everywhere.
Come on.

599
00:48:30,441 --> 00:48:32,010
Come on.

600
00:48:35,981 --> 00:48:37,748
Listen.
If the lights flicker,

601
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:39,584
we get out of the area
immediately.

602
00:48:39,684 --> 00:48:40,818
Okay? Okay?

603
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,287
Okay.

604
00:48:42,387 --> 00:48:44,055
We don't have
much batteries left.

605
00:48:44,155 --> 00:48:46,191
That doesn't give us much time
to get out of here.

606
00:48:46,291 --> 00:48:49,160
You know it. Oh, shit.

607
00:48:50,628 --> 00:48:52,263
Hey, get your vertical gear
together.

608
00:48:52,363 --> 00:48:54,165
If we hang like that,
we're gonna be vulnerable.

609
00:48:54,265 --> 00:48:55,266
Well, if we don't hurry up...

610
00:48:55,366 --> 00:48:56,701
That thing is
tracking us, man.

611
00:48:56,801 --> 00:48:58,169
What if it's
waiting down there for us?

612
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:01,939
We can't go back.
Here's a Domingo rig.

613
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:04,609
We got a water cave.

614
00:49:04,709 --> 00:49:06,177
Water's about three feet deep.

615
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:07,945
We don't have to rappel down.

616
00:49:08,046 --> 00:49:09,414
We can just swing down.

617
00:49:09,514 --> 00:49:11,716
Look. We know
it's back there, all right?

618
00:49:11,816 --> 00:49:13,284
It's a risk
we're gonna have to take.

619
00:49:13,384 --> 00:49:15,620
How many people are you gonna leave down there, Gannon?

620
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,223
What?
Nothing. Just go. Go!

621
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:23,628
Come on.

622
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:46,351
Hey!

623
00:49:50,021 --> 00:49:51,756
Hey, guys.

624
00:49:52,857 --> 00:49:55,093
Hey, you all right?

625
00:49:56,161 --> 00:49:57,962
Yeah, we're fine.

626
00:49:58,063 --> 00:49:59,664
Well, let's go.

627
00:50:06,871 --> 00:50:08,206
We need to talk.

628
00:50:08,306 --> 00:50:09,907
- What?
- It's time for a change of plans.

629
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,043
- Let's walk and talk.
- Let's talk right here.

630
00:50:12,143 --> 00:50:14,045
You're running us around in circles and this thing's picking us off.

631
00:50:14,145 --> 00:50:15,746
I'm trying to find
a way out of here.

632
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:16,747
And it keeps killing us.

633
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:17,748
Wanna stand around and chat?

634
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:18,949
We have guns. We have ammo.

635
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,918
- So what?
- So let's hunt this thing.

636
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,487
- You're crazy.
- Hear me out.

637
00:50:22,587 --> 00:50:24,055
Listen, we can barely defend ourselves,
and you wanna go

638
00:50:24,155 --> 00:50:25,690
- looking for it?
- Hear me out!

639
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:28,293
There's nothing
to hear, Ori.

640
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:32,063
We have a cavern.

641
00:50:32,163 --> 00:50:33,631
We use bait to lure it in.

642
00:50:33,731 --> 00:50:36,701
When it goes for it,
we snap off all of our flashes

643
00:50:36,801 --> 00:50:38,636
and we shoot the thing.

644
00:50:38,736 --> 00:50:41,972
We unload on the son
of a bitch. It'll work.

645
00:50:42,073 --> 00:50:43,774
It'll work.

646
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:47,245
- What do you guys think?
- What if it doesn't work?

647
00:50:47,345 --> 00:50:50,548
Well, then,
another one of us dies anyway.

648
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,250
Miranda?

649
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:54,152
It's up to you, Gan.

650
00:51:00,658 --> 00:51:03,428
Get your flashes.
That thing could be here any second.

651
00:51:04,162 --> 00:51:05,363
Put the bait in the middle.

652
00:51:05,463 --> 00:51:07,132
The rest of us hide
behind the stalagmites.

653
00:51:07,232 --> 00:51:08,833
Okay.
Who's gonna be the bait?

654
00:51:10,268 --> 00:51:12,470
- Gannon.
- Fuck you. It's your plan, you do it.

655
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,972
- I'm a better shot. We...
- What?

656
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,507
We can't afford a miss.

657
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:19,844
It's either you
or the girls.

658
00:51:19,944 --> 00:51:23,080
Come on,
that thing's gonna be here any second.

659
00:51:23,181 --> 00:51:24,782
Fuck you.

660
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:52,443
Lights!

661
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:20,871
Can you see us?

662
00:52:23,073 --> 00:52:24,642
No.

663
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:31,249
Feel like
I'm the only one in here.

664
00:52:58,409 --> 00:53:01,812
Look, about Rachel.

665
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:02,947
Don't do this now.

666
00:53:03,047 --> 00:53:04,048
I'm telling you
what happened.

667
00:53:04,148 --> 00:53:05,049
Yeah, but not now.

668
00:53:05,149 --> 00:53:06,183
My life is on the line.

669
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:07,385
You accused me
of letting her die.

670
00:53:07,485 --> 00:53:08,686
Now you're gonna
shut up and listen.

671
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:10,255
Crane was there.
He saw what you did.

672
00:53:10,355 --> 00:53:12,022
Man, you're making this up.

673
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:13,891
I know where
it's coming from.

674
00:53:13,991 --> 00:53:15,360
You're still hurt.

675
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:18,263
She played around with you
but still loved me.

676
00:53:18,363 --> 00:53:21,299
- Bullshit.
- And you fell in love

677
00:53:21,399 --> 00:53:23,133
with something
you couldn't have.

678
00:53:23,234 --> 00:53:25,236
Bullshit. Crane was there.
He saw what you did.

679
00:53:25,336 --> 00:53:27,972
Oh, yeah? And what
did he tell you, huh?

680
00:53:28,072 --> 00:53:29,807
What did he say?

681
00:53:31,576 --> 00:53:33,778
- Don't make me say it.
- No, no. I want you to say it.

682
00:53:33,878 --> 00:53:35,480
Get it out in the open.

683
00:53:37,515 --> 00:53:39,284
- Spit it out.
- Gannon, please.

684
00:53:40,451 --> 00:53:42,453
What? You in on this, too?

685
00:53:43,421 --> 00:53:44,955
And how about you, Miranda?

686
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:49,427
Oh, my God.

687
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:53,097
Oh, my God.

688
00:53:53,197 --> 00:53:55,966
We all know.
Even Domingo knew.

689
00:53:57,402 --> 00:54:00,137
What's happening here?

690
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,773
You killed her, Gan.

691
00:54:02,873 --> 00:54:05,610
You had her hand
and you let her go.

692
00:54:07,945 --> 00:54:09,914
Gannon! Gannon!

693
00:54:10,014 --> 00:54:11,316
Rachel! Hold on!

694
00:54:11,416 --> 00:54:13,083
Hold on to me!

695
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:15,286
Gannon, I'm slipping!

696
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,988
Oh, God!

697
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:54,685
Oh, God.

698
00:56:22,647 --> 00:56:26,316
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

699
00:56:28,453 --> 00:56:30,087
Hells, yeah!

700
00:56:30,187 --> 00:56:31,556
Gannon, are you all right?

701
00:56:31,656 --> 00:56:33,190
I'm out of bullets.
I got another mag.

702
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:35,259
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

703
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,462
Where's it hurt?
My leg.

704
00:56:37,562 --> 00:56:39,864
My leg! Don't touch it!

705
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:44,034
It's deep. To the bone.

706
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:45,235
Is he gonna be able to walk?

707
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:46,403
He's gonna need help.

708
00:56:46,504 --> 00:56:47,538
We'll take care of him later.

709
00:56:47,638 --> 00:56:48,606
Let's worry about this now.

710
00:56:48,706 --> 00:56:50,841
What the hell is it?

711
00:56:50,941 --> 00:56:54,411
Some kind of wolf-bear hybrid,
I don't know.

712
00:56:56,046 --> 00:56:57,548
There's no blood.

713
00:56:57,648 --> 00:56:59,517
That's not a good sign.

714
00:57:02,553 --> 00:57:04,822
What the hell?

715
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:06,557
What?

716
00:57:14,064 --> 00:57:15,700
This is unreal.

717
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,469
Oh, God! Oh, my God!

718
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:25,476
Go, go, go, go, go!

719
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:28,212
Run!

720
00:57:28,312 --> 00:57:29,847
Come on!

721
00:57:31,649 --> 00:57:33,551
Let's go! Come on!

722
00:57:40,024 --> 00:57:42,727
I can't hold him
much longer.

723
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:50,701
He's leaving a trail.

724
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:52,002
Damn it.

725
00:57:52,102 --> 00:57:54,138
Stop, stop, stop.
Set him down a sec.

726
00:57:54,238 --> 00:57:56,040
You grab him from behind.

727
00:57:59,143 --> 00:58:00,911
Just... Bailey?

728
00:58:05,282 --> 00:58:06,350
We did it again.

729
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:07,718
Did what?

730
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,987
We left someone behind.

731
00:58:10,087 --> 00:58:11,922
It's a bad time
for guilt, Gan.

732
00:58:12,022 --> 00:58:13,891
He was still moving.

733
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,661
He wasn't gonna make it.

734
00:58:16,761 --> 00:58:19,263
What do you mean,
he wasn't gonna make it?

735
00:58:20,565 --> 00:58:21,732
Rachel was still moving.

736
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:23,534
Don't do this to me, Gan.

737
00:58:23,634 --> 00:58:26,103
She would've pulled
both of us under.

738
00:58:26,203 --> 00:58:27,605
Hold on to me!

739
00:58:27,705 --> 00:58:30,340
- Pull me, Gannon!
- I'm slipping!

740
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,642
Get closer towards me!

741
00:58:31,742 --> 00:58:34,278
- I'm trying!
- Kick!

742
00:58:34,378 --> 00:58:36,446
- It's not working!
- Kick!

743
00:58:36,547 --> 00:58:38,148
Oh, God!

744
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:41,418
Rachel!

745
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,487
Rachel!

746
00:58:43,588 --> 00:58:45,990
No!

747
00:58:48,192 --> 00:58:50,027
Listen to me.

748
00:58:51,662 --> 00:58:54,765
I don't remember
if she slipped out

749
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:57,134
or if I let her go.

750
00:59:01,305 --> 00:59:03,741
Would you leave me behind?

751
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,878
No.

752
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:13,918
Maybe
we should split up.

753
00:59:14,018 --> 00:59:14,819
What?

754
00:59:14,919 --> 00:59:16,253
You go your way,
we'll go ours.

755
00:59:16,353 --> 00:59:17,454
He can't follow both of us.

756
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,023
You mean
I'm slowing you down.

757
00:59:19,123 --> 00:59:20,257
No.

758
00:59:20,357 --> 00:59:22,159
Yeah, that's part of it.

759
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:23,427
He's gonna be fine.

760
00:59:23,527 --> 00:59:24,695
Miranda, we left Ori.

761
00:59:24,795 --> 00:59:26,463
Ori had a spear
coming out of his back.

762
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,397
We couldn't help him.

763
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:29,066
Look at him, Miranda.

764
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:30,267
He's just getting worse.

765
00:59:30,367 --> 00:59:32,002
The only way we have a chance
is if we leave him.

766
00:59:32,102 --> 00:59:35,305
- Please, come on.
- Fuck you. I can still walk.

767
00:59:36,807 --> 00:59:39,009
Come on and help.

768
00:59:39,543 --> 00:59:41,078
Help me!

769
00:59:41,846 --> 00:59:43,180
Get away from me.

770
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:44,615
Forget it.
Just put your arm around me.

771
00:59:44,715 --> 00:59:46,416
- Go.
- Come on!

772
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:47,685
Go, go.

773
00:59:47,785 --> 00:59:49,720
Come on! Come on.

774
00:59:52,222 --> 00:59:53,290
Yes.

775
00:59:53,390 --> 00:59:54,391
- Did you feel that?
- Yeah.

776
00:59:54,491 --> 00:59:56,761
- Go.
- Go, go.

777
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,302
Come on.

778
01:00:05,402 --> 01:00:08,205
No! No, no, no!

779
01:00:08,305 --> 01:00:09,273
What was that?

780
01:00:09,373 --> 01:00:10,808
What the fuck?

781
01:00:10,908 --> 01:00:14,244
Oh, my God. No, no.

782
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:19,149
No! No, no, no, no, no! No!

783
01:00:19,249 --> 01:00:20,550
What the fuck?

784
01:00:20,651 --> 01:00:22,219
No, no, no! No!

785
01:00:26,556 --> 01:00:28,826
We're going in circles?

786
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,762
Bailey, I thought
you were mapping this place.

787
01:00:31,862 --> 01:00:33,297
I don't know.
I don't know. I lost track.

788
01:00:33,397 --> 01:00:35,432
What do you mean,
you lost track?

789
01:00:35,532 --> 01:00:37,067
I lost track. I lost track.

790
01:00:37,167 --> 01:00:38,736
I haven't been
mapping anything.

791
01:00:38,836 --> 01:00:40,337
I haven't been
surveying anything.

792
01:00:40,437 --> 01:00:41,972
Just shut up!

793
01:00:42,072 --> 01:00:43,708
- What are we gonna do?
- All right, come on.

794
01:00:43,808 --> 01:00:45,710
Come on, we'll try that hole.
We haven't been that way.

795
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:49,146
Get up and help me.
Get it together and get up!

796
01:00:49,246 --> 01:00:50,948
Come on, Bailey.

797
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:55,419
Bailey. Bailey, get up.
Bailey, get up.

798
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:56,921
Bailey, come on!

799
01:00:57,021 --> 01:00:58,655
Get up!

800
01:00:58,756 --> 01:01:00,424
Come on. Come on.

801
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:04,261
Come on.

802
01:01:29,954 --> 01:01:32,222
I don't see a way out.
I don't see a way out.

803
01:01:32,322 --> 01:01:33,490
What the fuck?

804
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:35,425
- Let's try the opposite side.
- No, no.

805
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:37,161
Hold on!

806
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:49,239
I'm sorry.

807
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:50,975
What?

808
01:01:51,075 --> 01:01:52,042
I can't.

809
01:01:52,142 --> 01:01:53,844
- What are you doing?
- I can't. I can't!

810
01:01:53,944 --> 01:01:55,512
- What are you doing?
- Gannon.

811
01:01:55,612 --> 01:01:57,748
- What?
- I can't!

812
01:01:57,848 --> 01:02:00,050
I can't. Can't.

813
01:02:05,956 --> 01:02:07,557
My batteries
aren't working!

814
01:02:07,657 --> 01:02:08,793
My batteries aren't working!

815
01:02:08,893 --> 01:02:10,527
Mine are all dead.

816
01:02:10,627 --> 01:02:12,562
Try your flashes.

817
01:02:16,266 --> 01:02:17,467
Fuck!

818
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:21,205
Mine won't work.
They won't work.

819
01:02:34,819 --> 01:02:36,386
No!

820
01:02:37,621 --> 01:02:38,856
Oh, my God, you guys.

821
01:02:38,956 --> 01:02:40,124
Oh, my God.
Did you hear that?

822
01:02:40,224 --> 01:02:42,626
- What?
- It's fucking in here.

823
01:02:42,726 --> 01:02:43,828
Where?

824
01:02:43,928 --> 01:02:45,462
On the right.

825
01:02:46,196 --> 01:02:47,497
Oh, no!

826
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,468
It's a wall.
It's a wall.

827
01:02:51,568 --> 01:02:52,736
Which way?

828
01:02:52,837 --> 01:02:54,304
Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on.

829
01:02:54,404 --> 01:02:56,606
Okay, there's a tunnel.
Right here, there's a tunnel.

830
01:02:56,706 --> 01:02:57,607
Go, go, go.

831
01:03:03,013 --> 01:03:04,381
Gannon?

832
01:03:05,749 --> 01:03:06,783
Gannon!

833
01:03:33,177 --> 01:03:34,478
Come on.

834
01:03:38,282 --> 01:03:39,816
Okay.

835
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,123
Come on.

836
01:03:50,027 --> 01:03:52,329
Go, go, go, go, go. Go.

837
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:04,774
Right here.

838
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:06,576
I can't see.

839
01:04:18,488 --> 01:04:20,724
Good.

840
01:04:20,824 --> 01:04:22,960
Our lights. Our lights.
Our lights.

841
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:24,761
There must be
some power left in them,

842
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,863
just not enough
for that cave.

843
01:04:28,065 --> 01:04:29,399
Oh, my God.

844
01:04:29,499 --> 01:04:31,068
What? What?

845
01:04:32,302 --> 01:04:34,972
- What?
- He's gone.

846
01:04:35,072 --> 01:04:36,373
I left him there.

847
01:04:36,473 --> 01:04:38,342
- I left him there.
- I know.

848
01:04:38,442 --> 01:04:40,410
- We had to. Okay? We had to.
- I left him there.

849
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:42,112
I left him there.
Gannon's gone.

850
01:04:42,212 --> 01:04:43,647
We don't know that.

851
01:04:43,747 --> 01:04:45,082
He might've gotten out, too.
Right?

852
01:04:45,182 --> 01:04:46,283
Please just say it with me.

853
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:48,085
He might've gotten out, too.
Okay?

854
01:04:48,185 --> 01:04:49,553
Oh, God. Oh, God.

855
01:04:51,055 --> 01:04:52,656
It's okay. Calm down.
Breathe!

856
01:04:52,756 --> 01:04:54,358
Listen, breathe.

857
01:04:54,458 --> 01:04:56,660
We're almost there.
All right? All right?

858
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:58,195
We're almost out. Okay?

859
01:04:58,295 --> 01:04:59,896
It's okay.

860
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:04,468
My God.

861
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:06,536
What? What? What?

862
01:05:08,305 --> 01:05:10,941
- A leaf.
- What?

863
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:12,476
Oh, God. Oh, daylight.

864
01:05:12,576 --> 01:05:14,911
Daylight!
Is that what I think it is?

865
01:05:15,012 --> 01:05:17,747
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
That's daylight.

866
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:19,349
Daylight! Oh, my God!

867
01:05:19,449 --> 01:05:21,185
Yes! Yes!

868
01:05:21,285 --> 01:05:22,987
Yes!
Daylight, daylight, daylight!

869
01:05:23,087 --> 01:05:24,321
We're gonna go home again.

870
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:27,324
Oh, my God.
Daylight. Daylight.

871
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:30,260
Oh, my God!

872
01:05:43,473 --> 01:05:46,977
I see the surface.
Bailey, I see the surface.

873
01:05:47,077 --> 01:05:48,445
Bailey, I see the surface!

874
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:52,449
Oh, I see it!
I see it. Oh, my God!

875
01:05:52,549 --> 01:05:54,118
- Hold on. Oh, God.
- Almost there!

876
01:05:54,218 --> 01:05:55,885
- Bailey.
- My foot's caught on something.

877
01:05:55,986 --> 01:05:57,487
What's it caught on?

878
01:06:00,557 --> 01:06:02,526
No!

879
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:04,494
No!

880
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:11,101
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

881
01:07:32,082 --> 01:07:34,784
Bailey!
Bailey, wake up! Bailey!

882
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,054
Oh, my God. What happened?

883
01:07:38,155 --> 01:07:40,290
I don't know.
I don't know.

884
01:07:40,657 --> 01:07:42,226
Oh, God.

885
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,095
- What happened?
- I don't know.

886
01:07:45,195 --> 01:07:47,063
- Where are we?
- We gotta get out of here.

887
01:07:47,164 --> 01:07:50,434
- Oh, God,
- we gotta get out of here.

888
01:07:50,534 --> 01:07:54,304
There's a door.
Come on. Miranda, come on.

889
01:07:55,739 --> 01:07:58,108
Come on. Come on.

890
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:00,977
Okay.

891
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:02,812
Come on. Come on.

892
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,448
One, two, three.

893
01:08:06,883 --> 01:08:09,253
It won't open!
Bailey, it won't open!

894
01:08:09,353 --> 01:08:10,954
Let us out of here!

895
01:08:11,054 --> 01:08:12,322
Bailey! Bailey!

896
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:14,724
Bailey, it's not moving.

897
01:08:18,695 --> 01:08:22,599
Look.
It's all our stuff.

898
01:08:40,184 --> 01:08:42,419
It's not all ours.

899
01:09:04,107 --> 01:09:06,376
It's a wing of a plane.

900
01:09:57,594 --> 01:09:59,896
Bailey, there's pictures.

901
01:10:12,576 --> 01:10:14,844
Is that the same plane?

902
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:25,289
It got them, too.

903
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:43,573
"Petr."

904
01:10:44,841 --> 01:10:46,443
Russian?

905
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:48,578
Yeah.

906
01:10:49,479 --> 01:10:51,748
He would have been 24.

907
01:11:00,424 --> 01:11:02,892
Water. Water, come on.

908
01:11:03,593 --> 01:11:05,261
Oh, God.

909
01:11:21,911 --> 01:11:23,780
This is mine.

910
01:11:41,064 --> 01:11:42,699
Oh, my God!

911
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,608
God, help me!

912
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:18,021
Petr?

913
01:14:20,557 --> 01:14:22,759
You like your name.

914
01:14:32,335 --> 01:14:33,670
He doesn't care.

915
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:36,105
We-- We're reaching him.

916
01:14:36,205 --> 01:14:37,373
You can't.

917
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:38,608
We have to try.

918
01:14:39,943 --> 01:14:41,511
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

919
01:14:41,611 --> 01:14:44,180
Petr, what's wrong?

920
01:14:47,016 --> 01:14:51,320
- No! No! No! No!
- My God!

921
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:52,656
Say his name.
Say his name.

922
01:14:52,756 --> 01:14:54,023
It's not gonna work.

923
01:14:54,123 --> 01:14:55,659
Petr! Petr!

924
01:14:55,759 --> 01:14:57,861
It doesn't care!
It doesn't understand!

925
01:14:57,961 --> 01:14:59,395
It's not human!

926
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:06,636
Oh, my God!
