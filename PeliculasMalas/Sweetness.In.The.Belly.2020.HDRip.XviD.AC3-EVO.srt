00:01:43,413 --> 00:01:46,281
Take this slip, go to
room number three, please.

3
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:49,385
Amina Mergessa
and Ahmed Mergessa.

4
00:01:59,796 --> 00:02:00,763
Welcome to the UK.

5
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,668
Is there a Miss Abdal?

6
00:02:07,737 --> 00:02:08,538
Miss Abdal?

7
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:13,041
You're Lilly Abdal?

8
00:02:13,776 --> 00:02:14,577
Follow me.

9
00:02:25,388 --> 00:02:26,422
This is your father?

10
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:28,190
Yes.

11
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,529
You've come from Ethiopia.

12
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:36,566
Where were you before that?

13
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,501
Morocco.

14
00:02:39,435 --> 00:02:40,570
How long were you there?

15
00:02:41,571 --> 00:02:42,371
12 years.

16
00:02:44,172 --> 00:02:45,173
Where were you born?

17
00:02:47,142 --> 00:02:49,846
My father told me I was born
on a Mongolian fishing boat

18
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,179
off the coast of Botswana.

19
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,549
But they're...

20
00:02:52,582 --> 00:02:53,449
Yes.

21
00:02:54,817 --> 00:02:56,184
Two landlocked countries.

22
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:57,720
I know that now.

23
00:03:05,728 --> 00:03:08,398
And your mother, did she have

24
00:03:08,431 --> 00:03:10,867
a different version
of your birth?

25
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,635
She said they found me
under a leaf.

26
00:03:14,571 --> 00:03:15,505
Right.

27
00:03:18,373 --> 00:03:19,676
Someone from Ethiopia...

28
00:03:21,444 --> 00:03:23,178
if they were to come to
England, how would I know?

29
00:03:23,211 --> 00:03:25,347
With the sheer
volume of refugees,

30
00:03:25,381 --> 00:03:27,249
and the fact that
not everyone ends up

31
00:03:27,282 --> 00:03:29,586
in the United Kingdom,
I'm afraid there's no way.

32
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,854
Now, if you'll follow me.

33
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,724
I need to go back.

34
00:03:39,294 --> 00:03:42,398
That's impossible,
the country's in chaos.

35
00:03:50,372 --> 00:03:51,708
Yes,
if you step this way please.

36
00:03:55,578 --> 00:03:56,913
Take a seat here.

37
00:04:00,817 --> 00:04:02,150
Just wait here.

38
00:04:09,892 --> 00:04:11,461

Well done, Lilly.

57
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,665
<i>When I was
seven years old,</i>

58
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:24,801
<i>my parents took me
to a Sufi shrine.</i>

59
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,336
Why are we here?

60
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,739
To see The Great Abdal.

61
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,274
<i>They took me
there to be blessed</i>

62
00:05:32,307 --> 00:05:33,810
<i>by a revered Sufi master.</i>

63
00:05:37,013 --> 00:05:37,814
<i>The Great Abdal.</i>

64
00:05:51,694 --> 00:05:53,396
<i>At least that's
what they told me.</i>

65
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:04,941
Mom!

66
00:06:09,045 --> 00:06:11,481
Mom! Mom.

67
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,452
Where are you going?

68
00:06:16,486 --> 00:06:18,721
We're just, uh,
going for a ride.

69
00:06:20,089 --> 00:06:21,591
Why aren't you taking me?

70
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,294
Why don't you go back and play
with the other children?

71
00:06:26,328 --> 00:06:27,362
No, but, Mom.

72
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:30,332
Sorry, Lilly.

73
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:33,402
We'll be back
before you know it.

74
00:06:36,773 --> 00:06:38,407
We'll see you soon, Lilly.

75
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,545
It took some doing,

76
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:52,849
but we were able to find
a record of a daughter

77
00:07:52,882 --> 00:07:56,686
born to a Philip
and Alice Mitchel named Lilly.

78
00:07:57,587 --> 00:07:59,455
Seems they applied for
a passport for you

79
00:07:59,488 --> 00:08:01,457
at the British
consulate in Istanbul.

80
00:08:02,758 --> 00:08:04,126
They never returned
to pick it up.

81
00:08:08,164 --> 00:08:11,901
This card identifies
you as a British citizen

82
00:08:11,934 --> 00:08:14,871
and permits you to return
home with all due rights

83
00:08:14,904 --> 00:08:18,140
and privileges, something
you will come to appreciate

84
00:08:18,174 --> 00:08:19,709
if you have any sense at all.

85
00:08:25,147 --> 00:08:26,816
But that's not my name.

86
00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:27,817
It is now.

87
00:08:55,144 --> 00:08:57,013
Attention, please!

88
00:08:57,046 --> 00:08:58,681
I have a short announcement!

89
00:08:59,749 --> 00:09:01,684
Is there someone who
can translate for me?

90
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:05,955
Is the English girl here?

91
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:09,926
I'll do it!

92
00:09:18,668 --> 00:09:21,570
Do you want me to translate into
Amharic, Harari or Oromigna?

93
00:09:21,604 --> 00:09:22,905
Whatever you think best.

94
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,208
Very well, you may proceed.

95
00:09:26,242 --> 00:09:30,546
The Refugee Referral Agency
will arrange for long-term

96
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:33,549
housing at several
different council estates

97
00:09:33,582 --> 00:09:35,685
as they become available.

98
00:09:35,718 --> 00:09:39,822
The name of anyone eligible
for immediate consideration

99
00:09:39,855 --> 00:09:43,859
will be posted on a bulletin
board in the dining area.

100
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,696
But what happens to us
if we're not chosen?

101
00:09:46,729 --> 00:09:48,164
Until your name
appears on that list,

102
00:09:48,197 --> 00:09:49,966
you can assume that most of you

103
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:51,667
will be here for
the foreseeable future.

104
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:07,016
Now, if there are
no further questions.

105
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:08,184
I have a question.

106
00:10:16,025 --> 00:10:17,660
When will she be back?

107
00:10:17,693 --> 00:10:19,195
She won't.

108
00:10:19,228 --> 00:10:20,629
When a person in authority says,

109
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:22,064
"And if there are no
further questions,"

110
00:10:22,098 --> 00:10:23,532
it means they had no intention

111
00:10:23,566 --> 00:10:24,767
of answering them
in the first place.

112
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:28,270
I didn't know that.

113
00:10:28,304 --> 00:10:29,605
Then you have a lot to learn.

114
00:10:56,665 --> 00:10:57,767
Nouria!

115
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:31,595
What did we expect?

116
00:13:43,265 --> 00:13:44,266
Excuse me.

117
00:13:46,302 --> 00:13:49,338
I'm supposed to go to
the Pelham Garden Estate.

118
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:51,474
Pelham is what we say.

119
00:13:51,508 --> 00:13:53,175
Pelham.

120
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:54,444
That's it, right there.

121
00:13:54,477 --> 00:13:56,178
Straight ahead and turn left.

122
00:13:56,212 --> 00:13:57,012
You'll see it.

123
00:13:58,481 --> 00:13:59,949
And there's no garden.

124
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,084
Thank you.

125
00:14:18,468 --> 00:14:19,436
All right.

126
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:01,904
She's been circumcised.

127
00:16:26,596 --> 00:16:27,963
I told her...

128
00:16:27,996 --> 00:16:29,432
I know what you told her.

129
00:16:34,504 --> 00:16:35,605
You would make a good nurse.

130
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:49,952
You are right.

131
00:17:05,402 --> 00:17:08,070
Now I must ask you
some questions.

132
00:17:13,576 --> 00:17:16,579
I don't really know anything.
You should really ask Nouria.

133
00:17:16,613 --> 00:17:18,947
My questions are not
about the child.

134
00:17:20,215 --> 00:17:21,049
Oh.

135
00:17:22,217 --> 00:17:23,553
Who are you?

136
00:17:24,721 --> 00:17:26,656
And what in the world
are you doing in Harar?

137
00:17:29,392 --> 00:17:31,193
Is this information
required by the hospital?

138
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,565
By me.

139
00:17:35,598 --> 00:17:36,399
I'm curious.

140
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,537
You may have noticed, you do
not look like anyone else here.

141
00:17:42,472 --> 00:17:43,272
Yes, I did.

142
00:18:15,204 --> 00:18:17,139
But there was supposed
to be a teacher here.

143
00:18:27,617 --> 00:18:28,984
I lived in Harar.

144
00:18:30,118 --> 00:18:32,087
A Muslim like you.

145
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,122
I studied Qur'an with the
Great Abdal at the shrine

146
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:35,391
to the blessed Bilal al Habeshi.

147
00:18:43,098 --> 00:18:44,801
Wait!

148
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:46,101
- Wait!
- We're not interested!

149
00:18:46,134 --> 00:18:48,070
I know, I know,
a question please.

150
00:18:48,103 --> 00:18:49,137
Just one moment.

151
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,143
Do you know this man?

152
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:58,347
Here in London?
Or is he still in Harar?

153
00:18:58,381 --> 00:18:59,449
I'm not sure.

154
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:03,620
Sorry.

155
00:19:04,654 --> 00:19:06,656
Who is this doctor to you?

156
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:08,725
And when did that
become our business?

157
00:19:08,758 --> 00:19:10,359
Just look again, please.

158
00:19:15,097 --> 00:19:17,232
No, my dear,
we don't know this man.

159
00:19:56,839 --> 00:19:58,340
I've come to check
on the patient.

160
00:20:16,526 --> 00:20:17,794
Oh, Lilly.

161
00:20:29,505 --> 00:20:30,406
May I speak to you?

162
00:20:35,378 --> 00:20:38,715
I would like to speak
to you in English,

163
00:20:38,748 --> 00:20:40,850
but I feel your friends
would not approve.

164
00:20:43,386 --> 00:20:46,288
Why would they consider it wrong
to speak in more than one language?

165
00:20:46,321 --> 00:20:48,658
Because it would appear
as if you and I were alone.

166
00:20:49,726 --> 00:20:51,461
Surely my reaction to your words

167
00:20:51,494 --> 00:20:53,295
would tell them everything
they need to know.

168
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:55,565
And what reaction is that?

169
00:20:58,401 --> 00:20:59,267
I don't have one.

170
00:21:01,638 --> 00:21:03,439
Or perhaps I haven't
decided yet.

171
00:21:06,776 --> 00:21:09,277
If you do decide,

172
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:12,382
and would consider sharing
that information with me...

173
00:21:15,551 --> 00:21:18,655
you might meet me at
the hospital at noon

174
00:21:18,688 --> 00:21:20,355
three days from now.

175
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,257
That is when Nouria will
run out of the bandages

176
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,191
I'm about to give her.

177
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,628
And then what?

178
00:21:25,662 --> 00:21:27,463
That would be up to you.

179
00:21:34,236 --> 00:21:35,638
I would like to go somewhere
where I can see water.

180
00:21:39,942 --> 00:21:41,711
You don't make things easy,
do you?

181
00:21:42,945 --> 00:21:44,414
I don't make them
any way at all.

182
00:21:50,318 --> 00:21:52,354
Get something green,
like the sea.

183
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,072
You might be eligible for
a position as a cleaner,

184
00:23:16,105 --> 00:23:16,939
but that's all.

185
00:23:19,408 --> 00:23:20,977
For 12 years I was taught
Qur'an by the greatest

186
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:23,311
Sufi master in Morocco.

187
00:23:23,345 --> 00:23:26,048
As well as mathematics, astronomy,
and classical Persian poetry.

188
00:23:26,082 --> 00:23:28,017
I'm sorry, but nothing
you've told me

189
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:31,554
suggests you qualify for
the auxiliary nursing program.

190
00:23:31,587 --> 00:23:34,490
You're saying I'm not
capable of emptying a bedpan?

191
00:23:34,524 --> 00:23:37,693
I'm sure you are, but there are
people with actual experience

192
00:23:37,727 --> 00:23:38,728
just as eager to do so.

193
00:23:40,096 --> 00:23:41,798
If you'll follow me.

194
00:23:41,831 --> 00:23:44,366
I speak Arabic,
some Amharic and enough Harari

195
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,502
and Oromigna to translate
the patients.

196
00:23:46,536 --> 00:23:48,571
Surely with the countless
refugees arriving every day,

197
00:23:48,604 --> 00:23:49,505
that would be helpful.

198
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:56,078
Be here tomorrow at eight
to meet with the supervisor

199
00:23:56,112 --> 00:23:57,847
of the auxiliary
nursing program.

200
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,049
Now, don't misunderstand,

201
00:24:00,082 --> 00:24:01,884
you'll primarily be
emptying those bedpans.

202
00:24:01,918 --> 00:24:03,886
Which we've already
established I can do.

203
00:24:10,092 --> 00:24:13,429
How come I always lose
when I play with you, huh?

204
00:24:13,462 --> 00:24:14,430
He cheats.

205
00:24:28,878 --> 00:24:30,980
I know you.

206
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:33,049
Just keep going!

207
00:24:33,082 --> 00:24:35,084
A few more stairs
and we'll get you into bed!

208
00:24:36,018 --> 00:24:38,788
She's having a baby!
Don't just stand there, help me!

209
00:24:38,821 --> 00:24:40,690
- Where's my son?
- He's there.

210
00:24:40,723 --> 00:24:42,525
- Where's my son?
- He's there. He's there, he's right there.

211
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:44,160
Hold my hand!

212
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:46,495
- Breathe, breathe.
- Hold my hand!

213
00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:48,030
Come and sit up.

214
00:24:48,064 --> 00:24:50,066
Oh, God.

215
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:51,901
Don't resist!

216
00:24:57,874 --> 00:24:58,875
Come, come.

217
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:01,944
Come on.

218
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:20,630
- Now!
- w start pushing, yes, that's it.

219
00:25:20,663 --> 00:25:23,132
- It's coming!
- Push now. A bit harder.

220
00:25:23,165 --> 00:25:24,166
Come on.

221
00:25:29,171 --> 00:25:30,473
Come on!

222
00:25:33,976 --> 00:25:36,145
Nearly there.

223
00:25:39,849 --> 00:25:40,783
Is he okay?

224
00:25:42,151 --> 00:25:44,153
He is a she.

225
00:25:46,522 --> 00:25:47,723
Hello.

226
00:25:52,261 --> 00:25:54,630
Ahmed, come and see your sister.

227
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:58,567
My son.

228
00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:08,778
Is there someone
we should call for you?

229
00:26:08,811 --> 00:26:11,847
- Someone at home?
- I found her in the building one over,

230
00:26:11,881 --> 00:26:13,849
- she was looking for a woman called Daisy.
- Daisy?

231
00:26:15,718 --> 00:26:17,954
They said when I was
in the shelter there

232
00:26:17,987 --> 00:26:20,056
that she may be
able to take us in.

233
00:26:20,089 --> 00:26:21,791
Daisy Obasi.

234
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,259
Ah, okay.

235
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:26,629
The rich boyfriend in
Manchester, he finally proposed.

236
00:26:26,662 --> 00:26:29,532
She's gone, I'm afraid.

237
00:26:29,565 --> 00:26:30,833
Is there somewhere
else you can stay?

238
00:26:32,902 --> 00:26:34,136
She can stay with me.

239
00:27:09,705 --> 00:27:11,540
She'll need these, it gets
cold in here at night.

240
00:27:20,883 --> 00:27:23,185
It must be nice to have
this place all to yourself.

241
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,088
I didn't ask for it.

242
00:27:26,122 --> 00:27:27,289
You didn't have to.

243
00:27:32,294 --> 00:27:33,796
I just need a few hours...

244
00:27:36,165 --> 00:27:37,767
get a little sleep.

245
00:27:39,235 --> 00:27:41,670
There's fruit in the kitchen and
biscuits in the cupboard by the sink.

246
00:27:41,704 --> 00:27:42,872
Oh, thank you, Lilly.

247
00:28:16,272 --> 00:28:18,808
Haile Selassie
claims he's modernizing,

248
00:28:18,841 --> 00:28:20,609
creating a cash-crop economy.

249
00:28:20,643 --> 00:28:22,178
Isn't that a good thing?

250
00:28:22,211 --> 00:28:23,979
The farmers don't grow food
for their families anymore,

251
00:28:24,013 --> 00:28:26,082
they grow it for
the rich landlords.

252
00:28:26,115 --> 00:28:29,285
And what do they do?
Sell it around the world

253
00:28:29,318 --> 00:28:31,153
while their own people starve,

254
00:28:32,054 --> 00:28:35,758
and as the emperor's dogs
eat off golden plates.

255
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:36,826
I had no idea.

256
00:28:46,202 --> 00:28:47,069
As you requested.

257
00:28:53,142 --> 00:28:55,845
I imagine this isn't
what you expected.

258
00:28:57,046 --> 00:28:58,147
I didn't know what to expect.

259
00:29:32,948 --> 00:29:34,917
Right now,
in this nearly perfect moment...

260
00:29:38,254 --> 00:29:40,356
it is easy to imagine
that anything is possible.

261
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,363
That I won't see injustice
and despair everywhere I turn.

262
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:51,767
When a thief looks at a saint,
all he sees are pockets.

263
00:29:53,503 --> 00:29:54,870
So I'm a thief, am I?

264
00:29:56,372 --> 00:29:57,706
It's a Sufi saying.

265
00:29:59,742 --> 00:30:01,010
It means what
we perceive in the world

266
00:30:01,043 --> 00:30:02,044
tells us who we are.

267
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,747
Tell me what do you perceive.

268
00:30:05,881 --> 00:30:06,449
In the world?

269
00:30:08,918 --> 00:30:10,252
That's too much to ask.

270
00:30:11,253 --> 00:30:12,721
Then tell me what you
see when you look at me.

271
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:30,072
You want to know what
I see when I look at you?

272
00:30:42,952 --> 00:30:44,019
I shouldn't be here.

273
00:30:47,424 --> 00:30:48,425
Then we'll go.

274
00:32:12,941 --> 00:32:14,243
Uh-oh, discovered.

275
00:32:16,211 --> 00:32:18,147
N... No. I'm...

276
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,516
I'm not doing what
you think I'm doing.

277
00:32:21,183 --> 00:32:23,952
I mean I am,
but for someone in need.

278
00:32:23,986 --> 00:32:25,388
No, I meant me.

279
00:32:25,422 --> 00:32:26,922
You've discovered
my hiding place.

280
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,459
It's hard to read around doctors

281
00:32:29,492 --> 00:32:32,094
when they're talking about
what it is they talk about

282
00:32:32,127 --> 00:32:33,797
when they aren't
doing any doctoring.

283
00:32:36,965 --> 00:32:37,600
That was humor.

284
00:32:42,472 --> 00:32:44,106
Or an attempt at
something like it.

285
00:32:46,609 --> 00:32:47,510
Then I'm leaving now.

286
00:32:48,411 --> 00:32:49,345
Oh, before you go.

287
00:32:56,185 --> 00:32:57,152
Zinc oxide.

288
00:33:02,459 --> 00:33:03,626
Nappy cream.

289
00:33:53,443 --> 00:33:55,210
I'm Fatima, you may
go downstairs.

290
00:33:58,381 --> 00:34:00,483
Don't you worry, I've got
everything under control.

291
00:34:16,666 --> 00:34:18,668
You're in for it now.

292
00:34:18,701 --> 00:34:20,670
They won't let me
leave for 40 days.

293
00:34:21,671 --> 00:34:23,473
But of course,
I won't stay that long.

294
00:34:23,506 --> 00:34:25,274
No.

295
00:34:25,307 --> 00:34:26,308
That's how it must be done.

296
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:30,713
It will be a good thing.

297
00:34:30,747 --> 00:34:31,648
For both of us.

298
00:34:33,616 --> 00:34:34,451
Really?

299
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:48,330
You are full of surprises,
English girl.

300
00:35:47,857 --> 00:35:49,124
My Papa's dead.

301
00:35:57,266 --> 00:35:58,066
Mine too.

302
00:36:48,918 --> 00:36:51,588
It has to look
especially nice today.

303
00:36:53,255 --> 00:36:54,757
Make sure you fluff it.

304
00:36:54,791 --> 00:36:56,258
I'm fluffing, Mrs. Peele.

305
00:36:58,193 --> 00:37:00,329
There, you look lovely.

306
00:37:00,362 --> 00:37:03,231
She's right,
you do look lovely.

307
00:37:05,835 --> 00:37:08,103
My son is coming
to visit me today.

308
00:37:08,938 --> 00:37:11,441
Perhaps a touch of lipstick?

309
00:37:11,474 --> 00:37:14,109
- Why don't we let the doctor take a look at you first.
- Oh, of course.

310
00:37:14,811 --> 00:37:17,380
This won't take long,
I promise.

311
00:37:21,918 --> 00:37:23,386
No sign of infection.

312
00:37:24,353 --> 00:37:25,388
I'm very pleased.

313
00:37:26,589 --> 00:37:27,590
Miss...

314
00:37:28,825 --> 00:37:31,159
- Abdal.
- Right, right.

315
00:37:31,193 --> 00:37:33,563
Yes, I must make note,
given that we're old friends.

316
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:49,277
So, tell me, who's been
attending to the surgical site?

317
00:37:49,311 --> 00:37:51,213
I have.

318
00:37:51,246 --> 00:37:53,683
For someone with no training
you're doing excellent work.

319
00:37:53,716 --> 00:37:56,486
Which I'm saying because
there's no sign of infection.

320
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:58,855
The training comment
was not relevant at all.

321
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,624
Yes.

322
00:38:02,625 --> 00:38:03,826
That was meant
to be a compliment.

323
00:38:07,397 --> 00:38:09,699
Though it likely didn't sound
like one, that's what it was.

324
00:38:09,732 --> 00:38:11,834
I was acknowledging your skill.

325
00:38:14,537 --> 00:38:16,639
Yes, of course.
Thank you, doctor.

326
00:38:16,673 --> 00:38:18,741
Please, don't,
just don't make it worse.

327
00:38:18,775 --> 00:38:19,642
Just...

328
00:38:21,711 --> 00:38:22,845
good.

329
00:38:22,879 --> 00:38:24,847
Excellent. Carry on.

330
00:38:43,933 --> 00:38:44,734
Aziz!

331
00:39:10,927 --> 00:39:11,894
I'm so glad you came.

332
00:39:13,529 --> 00:39:14,797
I didn't know if it
was the right building.

333
00:39:28,544 --> 00:39:30,680
This is what we do here.

334
00:39:31,914 --> 00:39:35,283
We watch exactly what
the emperor wants us to see.

335
00:39:35,317 --> 00:39:38,521
We complain, we criticize,

336
00:39:38,554 --> 00:39:40,990
we imagine resisting,
but we still watch.

337
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,632
You see this pale color?

338
00:39:49,665 --> 00:39:51,834
These are the best leaves.

339
00:39:51,868 --> 00:39:52,702
The sweetest.

340
00:40:24,433 --> 00:40:26,502
The army
is with us, Munir.

341
00:40:26,536 --> 00:40:29,071
Soldiers are turning their guns
on their own corrupt officers.

342
00:40:29,105 --> 00:40:31,707
Because they are
planning to take power.

343
00:40:31,741 --> 00:40:33,843
Good, it can't be
worse than Haile Selassie.

344
00:40:33,876 --> 00:40:36,344
It can always be worse.

345
00:40:36,379 --> 00:40:37,613
They'll get rid of
Haile Selassie,

346
00:40:37,647 --> 00:40:38,948
but they'll never
let the power go.

347
00:40:38,981 --> 00:40:41,651
You don't know what's in
the minds of the soldiers.

348
00:40:41,684 --> 00:40:43,920
They want to feed their
family just like us.

349
00:40:43,953 --> 00:40:46,989
The same soldiers who are
setting fields on fire

350
00:40:47,023 --> 00:40:47,957
to keep the crops
from their enemies?

351
00:40:49,792 --> 00:40:52,327
Destroying food while
their own people starve?

352
00:41:00,469 --> 00:41:01,671
Sadia.

353
00:41:03,673 --> 00:41:06,075
You are right, Sadia.

354
00:41:06,108 --> 00:41:09,145
The soldiers mutiny in
Asmara and we sit and talk.

355
00:41:09,178 --> 00:41:12,582
The unions call for a general
strike and we sit and talk.

356
00:41:12,615 --> 00:41:17,520
The army arrests government
officials, civilians,

357
00:41:17,553 --> 00:41:18,454
and guess what we do?

358
00:41:23,426 --> 00:41:25,728
Lilly, please,
do you mind if we go?

359
00:41:25,761 --> 00:41:27,096
- Aziz...
- Aah.

360
00:41:31,467 --> 00:41:32,668
Where are we going?

361
00:41:53,089 --> 00:41:54,423
Mr. Djimon.

362
00:42:09,472 --> 00:42:10,406
I am so sorry.

363
00:42:12,675 --> 00:42:13,442
What's wrong?

364
00:42:14,977 --> 00:42:16,078
He won't say anything,
I promise.

365
00:42:20,116 --> 00:42:21,550
I should feel nothing but shame.

366
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:25,454
And no doubt I will, but...

367
00:42:27,723 --> 00:42:28,925
in this moment, I'm happy.

368
00:42:40,202 --> 00:42:41,137
I should get back.

369
00:42:42,738 --> 00:42:43,940
Nouria will be worried.

370
00:43:13,169 --> 00:43:15,237
Today I thought I saw someone
I knew at the hospital.

371
00:43:19,208 --> 00:43:20,676
Chased him down the hall.

372
00:43:24,613 --> 00:43:25,781
It wasn't him.

373
00:43:37,059 --> 00:43:37,893
Hmm.

374
00:43:39,328 --> 00:43:40,730
There is a man.

375
00:43:41,864 --> 00:43:42,898
I knew it.

376
00:43:48,037 --> 00:43:49,705
Such eyes.

377
00:43:51,707 --> 00:43:53,542
I can see why you'd
want to chase him.

378
00:43:54,877 --> 00:43:55,811
It wasn't like that.

379
00:43:58,114 --> 00:43:59,081
It wasn't?

380
00:44:02,051 --> 00:44:03,152
Not just that.

381
00:44:09,158 --> 00:44:10,192
What?

382
00:44:24,673 --> 00:44:25,741
So many people.

383
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,181
She looks like Nouria.

384
00:44:33,916 --> 00:44:34,884
Might she be here?

385
00:44:35,951 --> 00:44:37,053
I can't imagine it.

386
00:44:38,388 --> 00:44:39,722
She would have gone
to the shrine.

387
00:44:42,024 --> 00:44:43,259
And your doctor?

388
00:44:49,131 --> 00:44:51,267
Anyone he met from home
would have sent him here

389
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,601
to put up a message.

390
00:44:58,974 --> 00:45:00,810
He said he'd do
whatever it took.

391
00:45:03,646 --> 00:45:04,914
No matter what.

392
00:45:05,981 --> 00:45:07,983
Then make it as easy
for him as you can.

393
00:45:19,396 --> 00:45:21,997
I see you've found
my favorite seat.

394
00:45:23,999 --> 00:45:26,035
I always come out here
early to get this bench.

395
00:45:27,169 --> 00:45:29,605
It's, uh... it's quiet.

396
00:45:31,974 --> 00:45:33,709
Even when it's not.
You know what I mean.

397
00:45:35,378 --> 00:45:36,178
How can I?

398
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,681
It doesn't make any sense.

399
00:45:42,852 --> 00:45:44,653
I didn't know
it actually had to.

400
00:45:45,888 --> 00:45:47,723
Here, please. It's yours.

401
00:45:50,693 --> 00:45:52,027
We could have shared it,
you know.

402
00:45:52,061 --> 00:45:53,229
People do that all the time!

403
00:46:00,369 --> 00:46:02,271
I know, I know, I know.

404
00:46:02,304 --> 00:46:04,441
But I prayed all night
that Sitta would sleep

405
00:46:04,474 --> 00:46:06,008
so that makes up for it.

406
00:46:08,077 --> 00:46:09,412
That's not how it works.

407
00:46:10,746 --> 00:46:14,717
And when I wasn't praying,
I was thinking about food.

408
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:15,951
Now which one should I have?

409
00:46:15,985 --> 00:46:16,819
Cabbage curry?

410
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:22,324
Or carrot curry?

411
00:46:27,062 --> 00:46:28,898
They both taste
exactly the same.

412
00:46:30,032 --> 00:46:32,301
My father would say curry
requires an education.

413
00:46:33,302 --> 00:46:34,069
Interesting.

414
00:46:35,804 --> 00:46:36,672
Tell me more.

415
00:46:37,806 --> 00:46:38,807
There's not much to tell.

416
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:42,011
My parents died
when I was seven.

417
00:46:43,746 --> 00:46:46,749
A child alone is...
is a terrible thing.

418
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:48,918
I wasn't alone.

419
00:46:50,487 --> 00:46:53,289
The shrine to Bilal al
Habeshi in Morocco took me in.

420
00:46:54,424 --> 00:46:57,092
The Great Abdal became
my teacher and my father.

421
00:46:58,327 --> 00:47:00,162
And that's the whole story?

422
00:47:00,196 --> 00:47:01,864
Until my journey to Harar.

423
00:47:02,831 --> 00:47:05,768
Lilly,
you are hopeless.

424
00:47:06,802 --> 00:47:08,237
What do you mean?

425
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:10,306
Nobody knows anything,
so they fill in

426
00:47:10,339 --> 00:47:12,174
the facts where they can.

427
00:47:14,043 --> 00:47:17,780
Vertise, she swears that your
father was a big game hunter,

428
00:47:17,813 --> 00:47:19,949
and your mother owned
a coffee plantation.

429
00:47:21,116 --> 00:47:22,351
Why would she say that?

430
00:47:22,385 --> 00:47:23,420
For fun.

431
00:47:24,387 --> 00:47:25,354
It's in a book.

432
00:47:26,855 --> 00:47:28,090
The thing I don't
understand is why anyone

433
00:47:28,123 --> 00:47:29,158
cares about these things.

434
00:47:30,926 --> 00:47:33,829
Because that's what people
do when we come together.

435
00:47:35,364 --> 00:47:36,932
We tell each other our stories.

436
00:47:38,468 --> 00:47:41,136
And if you can't share your
story, then who are you?

437
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,276
I spoke to Mrs. Jahangir
yesterday at the market.

438
00:47:47,309 --> 00:47:49,812
She said I can work there
three days a week to start.

439
00:47:50,946 --> 00:47:51,914
It's not much, but...

440
00:47:53,249 --> 00:47:54,917
if I get another job...

441
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:56,819
You should teach.

442
00:47:56,852 --> 00:47:58,988
Of course I should
teach.

443
00:47:59,021 --> 00:48:02,191
Now, if only my degree,
my references,

444
00:48:02,224 --> 00:48:05,428
my experience would be
able to convince someone

445
00:48:05,462 --> 00:48:07,930
other than you that
I am qualified.

446
00:48:09,865 --> 00:48:13,403
But that's not the point,
my point is,

447
00:48:13,436 --> 00:48:15,904
if I get another job then
we can get our own place.

448
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:18,941
Is that what you want?

449
00:48:21,277 --> 00:48:22,412
No.

450
00:48:23,513 --> 00:48:25,014
But surely you need me to go?

451
00:48:30,219 --> 00:48:31,320
Ahmed, be careful!

452
00:48:34,857 --> 00:48:35,891
What about your story?

453
00:48:38,027 --> 00:48:38,927
With their father?

454
00:48:43,566 --> 00:48:45,801
We knew what was
happening in the country.

455
00:48:48,337 --> 00:48:50,205
But for us everything was...

456
00:48:51,574 --> 00:48:53,576
it was good.

457
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:56,912
Yusuf started going to
these political meetings,

458
00:48:56,945 --> 00:48:58,548
then he took part in strikes

459
00:48:58,581 --> 00:49:00,249
and protests against
the emperor.

460
00:49:02,284 --> 00:49:06,255
And I, I said,
"Silly man, what...

461
00:49:08,123 --> 00:49:09,592
What are you playing at?

462
00:49:10,926 --> 00:49:12,995
You're an agronomist.

463
00:49:13,028 --> 00:49:14,431
What do you know
of such things?"

464
00:49:17,032 --> 00:49:18,435
When Haile Selassie's
soldiers...

465
00:49:20,503 --> 00:49:24,940
beat him... until he was broken

466
00:49:24,973 --> 00:49:29,878
and bleeding and lying at the
feet of his wife and his son...

467
00:49:32,281 --> 00:49:33,616
he was so surprised.

468
00:49:38,187 --> 00:49:40,055
Don't do it!

469
00:49:42,191 --> 00:49:43,192
Those are new shoes!

470
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:46,261
Ahmed!

471
00:49:48,263 --> 00:49:49,264
Ahmed!

472
00:50:53,362 --> 00:50:54,497
There is no meeting today.

473
00:50:56,064 --> 00:50:56,699
Where is Aziz?

474
00:51:16,686 --> 00:51:17,720
What are you doing here?

475
00:51:21,691 --> 00:51:24,427
I, I wanted to be with you.
I thought there would be a meeting.

476
00:51:24,461 --> 00:51:26,328
Djimon has heard
the house is being watched.

477
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:28,997
We cannot meet here again.

478
00:51:29,699 --> 00:51:31,401
Then when will I be
able to see you?

479
00:51:35,805 --> 00:51:38,106
Come away with me. One night.

480
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:39,341
No, I can't.

481
00:51:41,176 --> 00:51:42,344
What would I tell Nouria?

482
00:51:43,513 --> 00:51:47,182
Uh, tell her you are shopping

483
00:51:48,585 --> 00:51:50,820
- for Sadia's wedding.
- It's another lie.

484
00:51:54,691 --> 00:51:56,258
Everything is changing, Lilly.

485
00:51:58,495 --> 00:51:59,429
Everything.

486
00:52:01,296 --> 00:52:03,098
What does that have to do
with the nature of my sins?

487
00:52:08,671 --> 00:52:09,572
Just say yes.

488
00:52:22,519 --> 00:52:23,486
Say yes.

489
00:52:26,623 --> 00:52:27,423
Yes.

490
00:52:41,270 --> 00:52:42,204
Be careful.

491
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,442
Promise me.

492
00:53:07,362 --> 00:53:10,299
My goal is to bring
Lilly into the 20th century

493
00:53:10,332 --> 00:53:12,334
whether she likes it or not!

494
00:53:14,369 --> 00:53:16,171
That was my sofa.

495
00:53:16,204 --> 00:53:18,541
Ah, well, this is your sofa now.

496
00:53:18,575 --> 00:53:20,710
I bought it from Vertise.
She got a new one

497
00:53:20,743 --> 00:53:23,145
with blue and pink flowers
on a cream background.

498
00:53:23,178 --> 00:53:25,715
Which looks terrible with her
green carpet, if you ask me.

499
00:53:25,748 --> 00:53:27,650
Deh? Nobody is.

500
00:53:27,684 --> 00:53:29,217
So what do you think?

501
00:53:29,251 --> 00:53:30,620
It's very plaid.

502
00:53:31,921 --> 00:53:33,756
Excellent observation.

503
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:36,492
But it also does
something very special.

504
00:53:36,526 --> 00:53:39,361
Ahmed, come and show
Auntie her surprise.

505
00:53:49,472 --> 00:53:51,507
This is wonderful!

506
00:53:51,541 --> 00:53:54,544
- I've never seen anything like it!
- You see what I mean?

507
00:53:54,577 --> 00:53:57,312
Every day with Lilly I get
to experience the world anew.

508
00:54:41,991 --> 00:54:43,258
Amina?

509
00:54:49,264 --> 00:54:50,298
Are you all right?

510
00:55:05,648 --> 00:55:08,384
- We should go to hospital.
- No.

511
00:55:08,418 --> 00:55:09,585
Amina,
it could be something serious.

512
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:11,587
I know what it is.

513
00:55:19,929 --> 00:55:21,196
In the refugee camp...

514
00:55:26,636 --> 00:55:29,605
I had to do whatever
I could to protect Ahmed.

515
00:55:29,639 --> 00:55:30,940
Of course.

516
00:55:31,874 --> 00:55:35,545
The guards... when they
saw I wasn't circumcised...

517
00:55:37,547 --> 00:55:38,514
they turned me over...

518
00:55:40,282 --> 00:55:41,417
and did it the other way.

519
00:55:44,687 --> 00:55:46,422
Sometimes there is pain.

520
00:55:49,291 --> 00:55:50,693
Sometimes there's blood.

521
00:55:56,699 --> 00:55:57,633
It's over now.

522
00:56:01,704 --> 00:56:02,939
It will never be over.

523
00:56:16,519 --> 00:56:17,687
The water's cold.

524
00:56:24,961 --> 00:56:25,995
I'll check on Sitta.

525
00:56:59,796 --> 00:57:01,296
How long were you in the camp?

526
00:57:05,835 --> 00:57:06,702
Eight months.

527
00:57:15,077 --> 00:57:16,311
You figured it out.

528
00:57:18,614 --> 00:57:19,715
You could have told me.

529
00:57:28,558 --> 00:57:29,492
Which part?

530
00:57:32,695 --> 00:57:35,498
The shame that my Yusuf
isn't her father?

531
00:57:38,568 --> 00:57:39,735
Or the relief...

532
00:57:41,737 --> 00:57:42,905
that he didn't have to live

533
00:57:42,939 --> 00:57:44,807
knowing what they
did to his wife?

534
00:58:03,593 --> 00:58:04,694
<i>allahu akbar.</i>

535
00:58:30,887 --> 00:58:34,156
You must make a truly
light meringue, Mrs. Peele.

536
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:37,627
I have never been able to make a
floating island actually float.

537
00:58:40,029 --> 00:58:40,997
Let me see.

538
00:58:53,809 --> 00:58:56,178
- Good afternoon, Mr. Jahangir.
- Afternoon.

539
00:58:56,212 --> 00:58:58,214
Come and see what
I'm doing in the storeroom.

540
00:58:58,247 --> 00:59:00,716
Oh, yes, she has big plans.

541
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:02,818
Wants to do everything
but sell my groceries.

542
00:59:09,158 --> 00:59:11,594
So, what do you think?

543
00:59:13,562 --> 00:59:14,196
About what?

544
00:59:15,097 --> 00:59:16,465
Our new office.

545
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,535
Why do we need an office?

546
00:59:19,568 --> 00:59:23,973
For the Ethiopian Family
Reunification Association.

547
00:59:24,006 --> 00:59:26,642
- But there's no such thing.
- Well, there is now.

548
00:59:28,144 --> 00:59:30,813
See, after Djibouti,
I had to go through

549
00:59:30,846 --> 00:59:33,516
the central refugee
office in Rome.

550
00:59:33,549 --> 00:59:35,751
There were thousands
of us just waiting...

551
00:59:35,785 --> 00:59:38,888
I know, I was there for
I don't know how many weeks.

552
00:59:38,921 --> 00:59:43,592
We were there for months. And we just waited
while they did their endless paperwork.

553
00:59:43,626 --> 00:59:46,128
Now, if the office in
Rome could send a list

554
00:59:46,162 --> 00:59:47,863
of new arrivals from Ethiopia,

555
00:59:47,897 --> 00:59:49,932
it could be matched with
a list of people here

556
00:59:49,966 --> 00:59:51,834
searching for their relatives.

557
00:59:51,867 --> 00:59:53,569
Where would that list come from?

558
00:59:53,602 --> 00:59:55,838
How many
Ethiopian refugees

559
00:59:55,871 --> 00:59:58,541
are in our community
center alone?

560
00:59:58,574 --> 01:00:02,278
And almost every one of
them is just like you.

561
01:00:02,311 --> 01:00:03,913
Like me?

562
01:00:03,946 --> 01:00:06,148
They want to know if the
loved ones they left behind

563
01:00:06,182 --> 01:00:07,783
got out of the country alive.

564
01:00:09,285 --> 01:00:12,188
Look, my husband is gone.

565
01:00:12,221 --> 01:00:14,156
You don't know that for sure.

566
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:15,791
You only saw them take him away.

567
01:00:15,825 --> 01:00:16,826
He's gone.

568
01:00:19,028 --> 01:00:22,631
We will do this together,
but for our own reasons.

569
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,769
Now, I believe your
exact words were.

570
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:37,179
See?

571
01:00:37,213 --> 01:00:39,181
You really have no choice.

572
01:00:40,816 --> 01:00:43,085
Amina! Customer!

573
01:01:06,642 --> 01:01:09,045
Do you believe Miss Nairobi
won wearing that dress?

574
01:01:13,115 --> 01:01:16,085
Lilly, are you going to do
that until we get to Dire Dawa?

575
01:01:16,118 --> 01:01:17,286
Sadia, we lied!

576
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:19,889
We're not going to shop
for your wedding.

577
01:01:19,922 --> 01:01:21,557
So what? We harm no one.

578
01:01:22,892 --> 01:01:24,894
But what if you and I...

579
01:01:24,927 --> 01:01:27,096
- If we both...
- Have sex?

580
01:01:29,298 --> 01:01:30,599
Me and Munir have done it.

581
01:01:31,901 --> 01:01:33,235
Twice.

582
01:01:33,269 --> 01:01:34,804
Aren't you worried?

583
01:01:34,837 --> 01:01:36,238
About my parents finding out?

584
01:01:36,272 --> 01:01:37,339
About your soul.

585
01:01:37,373 --> 01:01:38,674
Ah, Lilly.

586
01:01:39,775 --> 01:01:40,743
You're so naive.

587
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:55,191
I see Munir.

588
01:02:32,895 --> 01:02:33,796
Thank you.

589
01:02:41,237 --> 01:02:42,371
You're a very practical Muslim.

590
01:02:44,206 --> 01:02:47,243
I like to decide
things for myself.

591
01:02:47,276 --> 01:02:51,947
Surely you have considered the Qur'an
is not meant to be... taken literally.

592
01:02:51,981 --> 01:02:57,987
That it is a... a story to be
interpreted by each, in his own way.

593
01:03:02,858 --> 01:03:03,426
I am sorry.

594
01:03:04,994 --> 01:03:05,761
I am sorry.

595
01:03:07,397 --> 01:03:09,131
It has been pointed out
to me more than once

596
01:03:09,165 --> 01:03:10,400
that I tend to state
the obvious.

597
01:03:11,901 --> 01:03:13,135
Clarity is not a sin.

598
01:03:14,471 --> 01:03:15,704
But boring people is.

599
01:03:17,407 --> 01:03:19,409
I've actually tasted
liquor before.

600
01:03:19,442 --> 01:03:20,410
Truly?

601
01:03:21,478 --> 01:03:23,279
When was this?

602
01:03:23,312 --> 01:03:26,115
When I was five-years-old,
maybe six.

603
01:03:27,783 --> 01:03:28,684
You are teasing me.

604
01:03:29,752 --> 01:03:30,387
I'm not.

605
01:03:32,121 --> 01:03:34,056
My parents had very
unusual ideas.

606
01:03:35,224 --> 01:03:36,158
They were not Muslim?

607
01:03:36,192 --> 01:03:38,928
No. No.

608
01:03:38,961 --> 01:03:40,329
I have wondered
why you never spoke

609
01:03:40,362 --> 01:03:41,398
of your father and mother.

610
01:03:43,132 --> 01:03:44,867
The Great Abdal
taught me to look forward.

611
01:03:45,901 --> 01:03:47,102
And so here you are.

612
01:03:48,103 --> 01:03:49,838
With a Muslim who
believes his faith is

613
01:03:50,906 --> 01:03:52,074
open to interpretation.

614
01:03:54,176 --> 01:03:54,977
Yeah.

615
01:03:56,011 --> 01:03:56,779
Here I am.

616
01:03:59,081 --> 01:04:00,182
A free spirit after all.

617
01:04:01,283 --> 01:04:02,084
No.

618
01:04:04,053 --> 01:04:05,854
Free spirits do
not fear judgment.

619
01:04:07,323 --> 01:04:08,290
And so what are you?

620
01:04:10,226 --> 01:04:12,429
Someone who's risking
the chance for paradise

621
01:04:12,462 --> 01:04:14,263
in the next life to be
with you in this one.

622
01:04:26,308 --> 01:04:29,412
The office in Rome sends
a new list every month.

623
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:31,947
And if your husband's
name is on it,

624
01:04:31,981 --> 01:04:33,450
I promise I will call you.

625
01:04:39,589 --> 01:04:40,856
You have a daughter?

626
01:04:46,128 --> 01:04:47,162
God has been good to you.

627
01:05:08,884 --> 01:05:11,421
Enough for today.

628
01:05:11,454 --> 01:05:14,056
- Let's go home.
- What about the post?

629
01:05:16,593 --> 01:05:17,860
It can wait.

630
01:05:24,933 --> 01:05:26,201
I'll get the chips,
you get the curry?

631
01:05:36,045 --> 01:05:38,047
Hello.
Two specials, please.

632
01:05:51,226 --> 01:05:52,194
Thank you.

633
01:05:54,963 --> 01:05:55,864
Lilly.

634
01:05:57,132 --> 01:05:58,033
Lilly!

635
01:05:59,536 --> 01:06:01,337
Hi.

636
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:03,105
I was just having dinner.

637
01:06:03,138 --> 01:06:03,972
Right.

638
01:06:05,408 --> 01:06:06,875
Would you like to join me?

639
01:06:06,909 --> 01:06:08,977
We have to go,
it's getting cold.

640
01:06:09,011 --> 01:06:10,513
Allow me to introduce myself.

641
01:06:10,547 --> 01:06:12,582
Amina Mergessa,
Lilly's best friend.

642
01:06:12,615 --> 01:06:15,317
Robin Sathi, I work with
Lilly at the hospital.

643
01:06:15,351 --> 01:06:16,251
Ah.

644
01:06:18,287 --> 01:06:21,290
Please, we won't keep
you from your dinner.

645
01:06:21,323 --> 01:06:23,560
- Yes, it's waiting right there for you.
- Lilly!

646
01:06:23,593 --> 01:06:27,363
Amina, it's...
it's fine.

647
01:06:27,397 --> 01:06:30,999
And Lilly, you're right.
A chicken dhansak as fine as Ananda's

648
01:06:31,033 --> 01:06:33,068
should not be
allowed to get cold.

649
01:06:33,102 --> 01:06:35,438
Amina, I truly hope
we meet again soon.

650
01:06:35,472 --> 01:06:36,506
As do I.

651
01:06:41,977 --> 01:06:43,178
What is wrong with you?

652
01:06:44,246 --> 01:06:46,315
How could you be so rude to him?

653
01:06:46,348 --> 01:06:49,284
I don't know, there's something
about him I find very irritating.

654
01:06:49,318 --> 01:06:51,554
I thought he was a lovely man,
perfect gentleman.

655
01:06:51,588 --> 01:06:53,155
Yes, too perfect.

656
01:06:53,188 --> 01:06:54,557
- Isn't that a good thing?
- Stop!

657
01:06:55,958 --> 01:06:57,394
There is no one for me but Aziz.

658
01:07:03,298 --> 01:07:05,934
Ahmed,
bring me my glasses.

659
01:07:05,968 --> 01:07:08,237
- I don't know where they are.
- Look for them!

660
01:07:09,706 --> 01:07:11,173
They're
probably in her bag!

661
01:07:16,345 --> 01:07:17,179
Ahmed!

662
01:07:28,190 --> 01:07:29,992
When I tell you
to do something...

663
01:07:36,566 --> 01:07:37,366
Ahmed...

664
01:07:39,034 --> 01:07:40,637
you're going
back to Mrs. Chilolo's.

665
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:42,004
But she doesn't have TV.

666
01:07:42,772 --> 01:07:43,939
Now, Ahmed!

667
01:07:46,074 --> 01:07:47,242
Do what your Auntie says.

668
01:08:24,246 --> 01:08:26,248
Your husband is alive, Amina.

669
01:08:29,452 --> 01:08:30,986
He won't be able to look at me.

670
01:08:32,154 --> 01:08:33,188
You don't understand.

671
01:08:34,757 --> 01:08:36,526
Yusuf is a scholarly man.

672
01:08:36,559 --> 01:08:38,360
- So?
- He knows the Qur'an.

673
01:08:38,394 --> 01:08:40,028
And so do you.

674
01:08:40,062 --> 01:08:42,297
It says that if someone
is forced to do something,

675
01:08:42,331 --> 01:08:44,366
like you were,
they're not guilty if a sin.

676
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:45,435
Forced!

677
01:08:46,636 --> 01:08:48,771
When Yusuf hears what
happened he'll understand.

678
01:08:48,805 --> 01:08:51,006
I didn't fight, Lilly.

679
01:08:52,775 --> 01:08:54,109
I didn't fight.

680
01:08:55,845 --> 01:08:59,214
I walked into their barracks
and I offered myself to them.

681
01:08:59,248 --> 01:09:01,751
- You did it to protect your son.
- Stop.

682
01:09:01,784 --> 01:09:03,553
What would you say to any
other woman in that camp?

683
01:09:04,821 --> 01:09:06,321
If she had done
what she could do

684
01:09:06,355 --> 01:09:08,558
to survive because
she knew her life was sacred.

685
01:09:09,792 --> 01:09:11,326
That it was a gift from Allah.

686
01:09:13,463 --> 01:09:15,297
She would never leave
her child all alone.

687
01:09:16,833 --> 01:09:17,934
What would you say to her?

688
01:09:21,804 --> 01:09:22,705
I would say...

689
01:09:24,807 --> 01:09:26,341
I would tell her she was right.

690
01:09:27,677 --> 01:09:28,645
That she did the right.

691
01:09:29,812 --> 01:09:31,113
The right thing.

692
01:09:34,484 --> 01:09:36,151
What if he doesn't want Sitta?

693
01:09:38,153 --> 01:09:40,222
You said that Yusuf believed
he must always strive

694
01:09:40,255 --> 01:09:41,624
to do better in the eyes of God.

695
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,060
Isn't that right?

696
01:09:47,864 --> 01:09:48,865
Yes.

697
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,301
Then give him
the chance to do that.

698
01:09:55,538 --> 01:09:56,606
He's alive.

699
01:10:01,477 --> 01:10:04,480
- <i>Alhamdulillah.</i>
- <i>Alhamdulillah.</i>

700
01:10:49,324 --> 01:10:50,493
I don't have the words.

701
01:10:52,729 --> 01:10:54,897
If you only had a minute to tell
him everything you needed to...

702
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:58,868
what would you tell him?

703
01:11:01,838 --> 01:11:02,839
About Sitta?

704
01:11:03,973 --> 01:11:06,274
Yes, about Sitta.

705
01:11:06,308 --> 01:11:08,745
And about learning
that he's alive.

706
01:11:18,253 --> 01:11:19,389
I would tell him...

707
01:11:29,399 --> 01:11:31,401
now that I know
that he survived...

708
01:11:33,403 --> 01:11:36,706
I can let myself remember just
how much we loved each other.

709
01:11:40,275 --> 01:11:42,845
How he taught me
about photosynthesis.

710
01:11:45,848 --> 01:11:47,617
How I taught him how to dance.

711
01:12:42,972 --> 01:12:44,272
Are you sure?

712
01:13:30,653 --> 01:13:31,921
Move against me.

713
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:18,467
Are we in love?

714
01:14:22,638 --> 01:14:23,573
I am.

715
01:14:25,608 --> 01:14:26,609
How do you know?

716
01:14:29,745 --> 01:14:31,080
It is a feeling.

717
01:14:33,950 --> 01:14:34,784
Right here.

718
01:15:56,699 --> 01:15:57,667
What is it?

719
01:16:06,943 --> 01:16:09,578
Munir and I are not
returning to Harar.

720
01:16:10,780 --> 01:16:14,183
Things are happening in the north,
we can't just watch from afar anymore.

721
01:16:14,216 --> 01:16:16,686
- What about the hospital?
- This is more important.

722
01:16:18,087 --> 01:16:21,223
We're going to fight for people
who can't fight for themselves.

723
01:16:23,659 --> 01:16:25,561
Lilly, as soon as you get back,

724
01:16:25,594 --> 01:16:28,898
Munir's uncle will put
you on a bus to Djibouti.

725
01:16:28,931 --> 01:16:32,201
Refugees are flocking there because
they have a British consulate,

726
01:16:32,234 --> 01:16:35,104
but you shouldn't be there
more than a few weeks.

727
01:16:35,137 --> 01:16:37,707
The color of your skin will put
you at the head of the line.

728
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:38,774
Why?

729
01:16:40,176 --> 01:16:41,610
Lilly, why do you think?

730
01:16:42,578 --> 01:16:43,646
You are white!

731
01:16:44,814 --> 01:16:46,716
You can go to England
and be anything you want to be.

732
01:16:46,749 --> 01:16:49,085
You don't have...
you don't have to be Ethiopian.

733
01:16:49,118 --> 01:16:50,252
You don't even
have to be Muslim.

734
01:16:50,286 --> 01:16:52,588
How can I be anything else?

735
01:16:57,660 --> 01:16:59,695
- I'm not leaving.
- Lilly...

736
01:16:59,729 --> 01:17:01,030
I'm going back to
Nouria's to wait for you...

737
01:17:01,063 --> 01:17:03,065
You have been seen
at the meetings!

738
01:17:03,099 --> 01:17:05,501
If I'm taken,
they might come for you next.

739
01:17:06,335 --> 01:17:08,304
And if they find you with
Nouria, you'll be putting her

740
01:17:08,337 --> 01:17:09,805
and Bourtoucan in danger, too.

741
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:11,941
Last night in Addis...

742
01:17:14,176 --> 01:17:17,546
the army executed
60 political prisoners.

743
01:17:18,881 --> 01:17:19,749
60!

744
01:17:20,983 --> 01:17:22,952
Over 50 of them were
their own generals.

745
01:17:24,286 --> 01:17:26,088
I need to know you're
somewhere safe.

746
01:17:29,992 --> 01:17:33,729
Did you know you were
leaving me... before?

747
01:17:37,767 --> 01:17:40,636
Everything is changing
so fast, Lilly.

748
01:17:41,937 --> 01:17:43,105
Does that really matter?

749
01:17:44,273 --> 01:17:45,174
Of course it does.

750
01:18:01,791 --> 01:18:03,025
It's not enough.

751
01:18:06,996 --> 01:18:08,230
But it's all I have
to give for now.

752
01:18:14,303 --> 01:18:15,571
So you won't forget me.

753
01:18:16,906 --> 01:18:19,108
This won't last long.

754
01:18:19,141 --> 01:18:21,110
There are too many
of us for them to fight.

755
01:18:22,211 --> 01:18:25,147
I promise, as soon as I can,
I'll come find you.

756
01:18:30,052 --> 01:18:30,986
We have to go.

757
01:18:32,788 --> 01:18:33,889
Lilly, now!

758
01:18:35,157 --> 01:18:37,626
<i>...100,000
people died of starvation</i>

759
01:18:37,660 --> 01:18:38,694
<i>in northern Ethiopia.</i>

760
01:18:40,696 --> 01:18:42,731
<i>Not long after, civil unrest</i>

761
01:18:42,765 --> 01:18:44,767
<i>resulting from
economic pressures,</i>

762
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,203
<i>brought an end to Emperor
Haile Selassie's regime</i>

763
01:18:47,236 --> 01:18:48,637
<i>and the military took over.</i>

764
01:18:50,372 --> 01:18:53,209
<i>Now the same civilians who
helped bring about change</i>

765
01:18:53,242 --> 01:18:57,012
<i>are being imprisoned without
charge, tortured, and executed.</i>

766
01:18:58,214 --> 01:19:01,317
<i>And the ruling military party
has virtually closed off</i>

767
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:03,285
<i>the country from
the outside world</i>

768
01:19:03,319 --> 01:19:05,821
<i>as they continue
to jostle for power.</i>

769
01:19:15,364 --> 01:19:16,832
<i>Hello?</i>

770
01:19:16,866 --> 01:19:18,267
Hello, I'm calling
to check on a potential

771
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:20,035
arrival from Ethiopia.

772
01:19:20,069 --> 01:19:22,104
Dr. Aziz Abdulnassar.

773
01:19:22,138 --> 01:19:24,106
<i>Is he
on the latest list?</i>

774
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:25,442
No, he's not on
the most recent list,

775
01:19:25,475 --> 01:19:27,143
but I know there have been
several flights since...

776
01:19:27,176 --> 01:19:29,812
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>
- Please, if you'll just check...

777
01:19:29,845 --> 01:19:31,381
- <i>You hold, please.</i>
- I've been on hold.

778
01:19:31,414 --> 01:19:33,082
<i>You must hold.</i>

779
01:19:33,115 --> 01:19:34,016
All right.

780
01:19:49,131 --> 01:19:50,467
<i>♪ Just bring it on up ♪</i>

781
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:52,101
<i>♪ Bring it on up ♪</i>

782
01:19:53,836 --> 01:19:55,704
<i>♪ Just bring it on up ♪</i>

783
01:19:57,806 --> 01:19:58,841
What's going on?

784
01:20:01,243 --> 01:20:03,879
One of Vertise's
boy's birthdays.

785
01:20:03,913 --> 01:20:05,915
Don't ask me which one.

786
01:20:05,948 --> 01:20:06,815
I need to sit.

787
01:20:47,056 --> 01:20:47,657
Yusuf?

788
01:20:50,826 --> 01:20:52,429
What have they done to you?

789
01:20:53,496 --> 01:20:56,165
Yusuf! What have they done?

790
01:20:56,198 --> 01:20:57,400
It's all right.

791
01:21:02,104 --> 01:21:03,172
My love.

792
01:21:06,842 --> 01:21:10,045
You didn't write back.
Why didn't you write to me?

793
01:21:10,079 --> 01:21:13,015
All I could think about
was seeing your face.

794
01:21:14,517 --> 01:21:17,554
- My love.
- Why didn't you write?

795
01:21:17,587 --> 01:21:20,490
I'm sorry, I wanted
to surprise you.

796
01:21:24,893 --> 01:21:25,794
Is that Sitta?

797
01:21:28,531 --> 01:21:29,466
Is that our daughter?

798
01:21:39,275 --> 01:21:40,342
Oh, Sitta!

799
01:21:45,214 --> 01:21:46,015
Sitta.

800
01:21:48,485 --> 01:21:49,351
It's your Papa.

801
01:22:01,330 --> 01:22:02,931
I've come to take you
to your new home.

802
01:22:06,969 --> 01:22:09,204
Sitta, you'll love Alberta.

803
01:22:30,259 --> 01:22:32,094
When the Great Abdal told me

804
01:22:32,127 --> 01:22:33,530
he was going to give me a home,

805
01:22:35,097 --> 01:22:36,499
I demanded to know why.

806
01:22:39,602 --> 01:22:41,303
I was just
a little thing, but...

807
01:22:43,305 --> 01:22:45,908
I told him he couldn't
tell me it was God's will,

808
01:22:47,009 --> 01:22:49,144
because my mother had told me
there wasn't any god.

809
01:22:50,079 --> 01:22:50,913
Was he angry?

810
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:52,582
What did he say?

811
01:22:55,184 --> 01:22:57,252
He said that
all I needed to know...

812
01:22:58,488 --> 01:23:03,292
was that his heart and my
heart were very old friends.

813
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:06,028
Like yours and mine.

814
01:23:49,539 --> 01:23:51,541
Plenty of time, plenty of time.

815
01:23:56,646 --> 01:23:57,580
My darling.

816
01:23:59,114 --> 01:24:01,049
- How are you?
- Good morning.

817
01:24:01,083 --> 01:24:02,017
Hello, you.

818
01:24:07,457 --> 01:24:08,991
- Watch the basket.
- Okay.

819
01:24:15,665 --> 01:24:18,601
Cookies for my precious
Ahmed, and for Sitta.

820
01:24:20,670 --> 01:24:21,937
Shh.

821
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:26,341
You have been so good to us.

822
01:24:27,577 --> 01:24:28,411
So good.

823
01:24:37,787 --> 01:24:39,622
Amazing, yes?

824
01:24:39,656 --> 01:24:41,123
What the body can endure.

825
01:24:43,393 --> 01:24:44,159
And the spirit.

826
01:24:47,764 --> 01:24:49,566
Amina told me about
your young man.

827
01:24:52,334 --> 01:24:53,168
I know nothing.

828
01:24:55,237 --> 01:24:57,674
He could be in a prison
like you were, I don't know.

829
01:25:00,443 --> 01:25:01,343
Let's hope so.

830
01:25:15,391 --> 01:25:17,359
I'm going in front.

831
01:25:17,393 --> 01:25:20,630
You will sit in the back
with me and your sister.

832
01:25:20,663 --> 01:25:22,297
Your mother must
ride in comfort.

833
01:25:27,403 --> 01:25:29,338
I can't even look at you.

834
01:25:41,718 --> 01:25:43,051
It's time.

835
01:26:00,403 --> 01:26:03,506
<i>Inshallah</i> we shall
see each other again my sister.

836
01:26:04,641 --> 01:26:06,108
<i>Inshallah.</i>

837
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:17,172
Aziz!

838
01:28:41,263 --> 01:28:43,966
There he is. Uncle Djimon is
here to get you out of the country.

839
01:28:45,702 --> 01:28:46,301
Lilly?

840
01:28:49,639 --> 01:28:50,540
I can't just leave.

841
01:29:08,658 --> 01:29:10,393
Nouria! Nouria!

842
01:29:54,570 --> 01:29:55,438
May I?

843
01:29:57,006 --> 01:29:58,775
There isn't one other seat.

844
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:01,444
See for yourself.

845
01:30:08,084 --> 01:30:09,752
This may be the first
time I've seen you in here

846
01:30:09,786 --> 01:30:11,654
when you haven't had
a book right in your face.

847
01:30:13,422 --> 01:30:15,825
You must really like them?

848
01:30:18,861 --> 01:30:21,329
Books, I, I assume.

849
01:30:23,566 --> 01:30:25,635
- You're right.
- I like books, too.

850
01:30:27,403 --> 01:30:31,073
Well, I'm in a bit of a,
a science fiction rut,

851
01:30:31,107 --> 01:30:33,910
you know, Bradbury,
Asimov, Le Guin.

852
01:30:33,943 --> 01:30:35,378
Perhaps you could
recommend a change of...

853
01:30:35,411 --> 01:30:36,445
No, I can't.

854
01:30:38,981 --> 01:30:39,816
That's too bad.

855
01:30:42,151 --> 01:30:44,120
I thought perhaps literature

856
01:30:44,153 --> 01:30:46,022
might just be
the conversational ticket.

857
01:30:51,561 --> 01:30:52,428
I'm sorry.

858
01:30:54,831 --> 01:30:55,731
I don't mean to bother you.

859
01:30:59,836 --> 01:31:02,538
It was, it was
a pleasure almost having

860
01:31:02,572 --> 01:31:04,040
a conversation with you,
Miss Abdal.

861
01:31:38,474 --> 01:31:40,042
I'm sorry.

862
01:31:40,076 --> 01:31:41,377
I hope you haven't
been waiting long.

863
01:31:42,712 --> 01:31:43,913
I have no appointment.

864
01:31:44,847 --> 01:31:46,148
Please, come in.

865
01:31:56,726 --> 01:31:57,960
Please, have a seat Mr...

866
01:31:59,061 --> 01:32:00,129
My name is Tariq.

867
01:32:01,764 --> 01:32:03,532
This is the right place?

868
01:32:03,566 --> 01:32:04,734
You are Lilly Abdal?

869
01:32:04,767 --> 01:32:06,736
Yes, please come in.

870
01:32:07,670 --> 01:32:08,571
Thank you.

871
01:32:17,046 --> 01:32:19,148
What can I help you with?

872
01:32:19,181 --> 01:32:20,650
Are you trying to find someone?

873
01:32:24,720 --> 01:32:25,821
I'll make you some coffee.

874
01:32:31,494 --> 01:32:35,498
I was held in a prison
near the Somali border.

875
01:32:36,766 --> 01:32:38,601
I was not there long before...

876
01:32:40,503 --> 01:32:41,938
A guard beat me in such a way...

877
01:32:43,739 --> 01:32:45,007
that when he finished...

878
01:32:46,842 --> 01:32:48,911
there was only darkness.

879
01:32:52,281 --> 01:32:53,616
I could no longer see.

880
01:32:56,118 --> 01:32:57,553
Then the doctor came.

881
01:33:01,157 --> 01:33:05,094
He had been part of the resistance
to the military takeover.

882
01:33:07,630 --> 01:33:08,764
He too was a prisoner.

883
01:33:09,732 --> 01:33:10,766
He was tortured.

884
01:33:12,001 --> 01:33:12,969
But even so...

885
01:33:14,804 --> 01:33:16,105
he cared for all of us.

886
01:33:20,109 --> 01:33:24,113
He promised... my blindness
would not last.

887
01:33:37,326 --> 01:33:38,227
You see?

888
01:33:40,262 --> 01:33:41,097
He did not lie.

889
01:33:43,799 --> 01:33:45,001
He was the best man.

890
01:33:47,269 --> 01:33:48,537
Because of him...

891
01:33:50,806 --> 01:33:54,577
many of us were
spared further pain.

892
01:33:58,114 --> 01:33:59,949
Do you know what
happened to him?

893
01:34:06,589 --> 01:34:07,590
A day came...

894
01:34:09,625 --> 01:34:11,060
when a guard

895
01:34:11,093 --> 01:34:14,196
took many of us
into a courtyard.

896
01:34:14,230 --> 01:34:16,932
They told us we would
have a good show.

897
01:34:35,051 --> 01:34:36,952
"Counter-revolutionary."

898
01:34:36,986 --> 01:34:38,087
That's what they called us.

899
01:34:43,659 --> 01:34:44,560
But then...

900
01:34:46,629 --> 01:34:47,863
they brought him out.

901
01:34:51,100 --> 01:34:51,734
The doctor.

902
01:34:55,037 --> 01:34:57,139
He would not die on his knees.

903
01:36:09,479 --> 01:36:11,680
Lilly, I'm going to get Zema!

904
01:36:40,377 --> 01:36:41,411
What are you doing here?

905
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:46,416
First, drink.

906
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:53,756
You managed to get
quite dehydrated

907
01:36:53,789 --> 01:36:56,225
with a doctor in the next room.

908
01:36:56,258 --> 01:36:58,428
I might have to reconsider
my career choice.

909
01:37:03,766 --> 01:37:05,134
Mm-mm, keep going.

910
01:37:11,307 --> 01:37:12,241
There you go.

911
01:37:20,883 --> 01:37:22,284
Now tell me.

912
01:37:22,318 --> 01:37:23,252
Please.

913
01:37:24,353 --> 01:37:26,222
Right.

914
01:37:28,257 --> 01:37:30,359
Someone named Senit

915
01:37:31,293 --> 01:37:33,295
found you on the floor
outside your flat.

916
01:37:35,398 --> 01:37:39,768
She got your spare key
from someone named Vertise,

917
01:37:39,802 --> 01:37:42,938
who then called Mrs. Jahangir,

918
01:37:42,972 --> 01:37:46,476
who then called Amina in Canada,

919
01:37:46,509 --> 01:37:49,979
and she called the hospital
and tracked down...

920
01:37:51,448 --> 01:37:52,281
me.

921
01:37:55,284 --> 01:37:56,852
That means I must
have told Senit.

922
01:38:00,089 --> 01:38:01,257
I believe you did, Lilly.

923
01:38:03,892 --> 01:38:05,027
So everyone knows?

924
01:38:07,464 --> 01:38:08,398
Everyone knows.

925
01:39:29,978 --> 01:39:32,214
I see you've found some
new reading material.

926
01:39:38,655 --> 01:39:39,622
I never thanked you.

927
01:39:41,624 --> 01:39:42,958
Not properly.

928
01:39:42,991 --> 01:39:44,594
For recommending
science fiction?

929
01:39:45,961 --> 01:39:46,995
For taking care of me.

930
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:51,166
There's no need.

931
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:52,000
Of course there is.

932
01:39:54,169 --> 01:39:57,306
Well then I believe
I should thank you, as well,

933
01:39:57,339 --> 01:40:01,276
for inspiring me to expand
my literary horizons.

934
01:40:02,445 --> 01:40:03,912
Sufi poetry.

935
01:40:05,981 --> 01:40:07,916
So you see,

936
01:40:07,950 --> 01:40:10,453
it's a,
it's a good deal all around.

937
01:40:33,710 --> 01:40:34,943
When I was seven years old,

938
01:40:36,446 --> 01:40:38,080
my parents took me to Morocco.

939
01:40:41,250 --> 01:40:43,453
We went to a Sufi shrine
at the edge of the Sahara.

940
01:40:47,356 --> 01:40:50,025
They left me there,
and they never came back.

941
01:40:56,666 --> 01:40:58,033
It wasn't until years later

942
01:40:58,066 --> 01:40:59,334
that I found out what
happened to them.

943
01:41:02,037 --> 01:41:04,507
And even then, all I was told

944
01:41:04,541 --> 01:41:07,610
was that drugs were involved,
and that they died together.

945
01:41:13,115 --> 01:41:14,451
I don't, I don't
know what to say.

946
01:41:15,385 --> 01:41:16,351
It's all right.

947
01:41:18,187 --> 01:41:20,289
I was happy there.

948
01:41:26,094 --> 01:41:27,329
And I was loved.

949
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:32,067
I would have stayed
there forever if I could.

950
01:41:46,716 --> 01:41:49,586
Of course I can call back,

951
01:41:49,619 --> 01:41:51,521
but it will be to speak
with your supervisor.

952
01:41:56,392 --> 01:42:00,563
<i>Lilly, how much there is
to tell you about Alberta.</i>

953
01:42:00,597 --> 01:42:03,198
<i>Today, I met
a woman in the market,</i>

954
01:42:03,232 --> 01:42:04,567
<i>we reached for
the same melon.</i>

955
01:42:06,703 --> 01:42:08,638
<i>She came here alone from Chile</i>

956
01:42:08,671 --> 01:42:11,373
<i>after her family was killed
during the military coup.</i>

957
01:42:13,376 --> 01:42:15,612
<i>She said she has put
down roots here,</i>

958
01:42:15,645 --> 01:42:19,281
<i>and in that moment,
I knew I could do that too.</i>

959
01:42:20,249 --> 01:42:23,285
<i>And not just because I ended
up with the melon!</i>

960
01:42:28,357 --> 01:42:31,326
<i>We are branches from
the same tree, my sister.</i>

961
01:42:32,395 --> 01:42:36,566
<i>We must plant ourselves
where we are,</i>

962
01:42:36,599 --> 01:42:40,068
<i>and know in our hearts
that we are home.</i>

963
01:42:53,284 --> 01:42:58,284
