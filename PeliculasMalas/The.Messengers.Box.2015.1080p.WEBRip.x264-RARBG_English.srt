8
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:48,616
What goes in there?

9
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:53,754
One day, Simon...

10
00:00:53,787 --> 00:00:56,624
You will know.

11
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:03,431

I do my bestto keep an eyeon the place,

22
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:49,837
but it's goodto double-check.

23
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,873
My eyes aren't as goodas they used to be.

24
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,743

25
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,878

Crazy old grandpa.

36
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:04,678
I bet there'snot one thing up hereworth anything.

37
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:30,338
Mom? mom?

38
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:34,742
What is this?

39
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:35,976
A wooden box.

40
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,245
I know, but...

41
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:41,382
Is it a jewelry boxor something?

42
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:44,518
I don't know,bring it down hereso I can see it.

43
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:54,294
No, I don't think so.

44
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:56,330
It feels like there'ssomething in it.

45
00:04:57,898 --> 00:04:59,500
It is pretty heavy.

46
00:05:02,002 --> 00:05:05,539
It can't bethe wood.

47
00:05:05,573 --> 00:05:06,974
I don't know, Jake.

48
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:09,343
Can I have it?

49
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:12,946
Of course you can.

50
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,349
You didn't feel anythingwhen you opened it?

51
00:05:15,383 --> 00:05:18,419
No. why?

53
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:22,390
It was really weird.

54
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:24,425
Maybe it wasgrandpa telling youto leave his stuff alone.

55
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,759
You know howhe could always tell

56
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:28,829
when somethingwas moved.

57
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,998

00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,536
No, don't evenstart thinking that.

177
00:13:56,569 --> 00:14:00,107
No. I'm not on drugs.

And no,

179
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,276

00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,222
No, I thought he'dbe with you...

182
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:16,823
Is something wrong?

183
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,059
Maybe he's stillin the lunch line?

184
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:27,901
Jake, what are youdoing here?

185
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:30,237

Everybody calm down.The situation is okay.

210
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,238
I've got your backpack.It's okay.

211
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,539
Finish your lunches.

212
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,008

Principal: let's go!

214
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:50,350
So what'sgoing on you guys,what's the deal?

215
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:53,253
We don't havea deal, sir.

216
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,455
So you guysboth know the consequencesfor fighting at school,

217
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:58,191
- don't you?- Yes, sir.

218
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:00,994
That's why I neverfight in school, sir.

219
00:16:01,028 --> 00:16:03,130
We weren'tfighting, sir.

220
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:05,598
It was justa misunderstanding.

221
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,667
That's notwhat it looked like

222
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,103
from acrossthe cafeteria.

223
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:13,306
Okay?

224
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,175
Kids don't normally gatheraround like that

225
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,377
unless there'ssome sort of altercationgoing on.

226
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,147
And if you remember,i pulled you two offof each other.

227
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,282
Now do I haveto pull out the rulebook

228
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,417
so you two can startmemorizing all the rulesaround here?

229
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:28,921
Or...

230
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:30,523
Maybe we haveour own little,"breakfast club?"

231
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:40,167
"The breakfast club"?It's a John Hughes film.

232
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,335
Molly ringwald...

233
00:16:42,369 --> 00:16:43,703
A cool moviefrom the '80s

234
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:47,307
about a bunch of kidsin detention.

235
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,112
Nothing?

236
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,482

239
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:03,356

240
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,292

One on you,and the other on you.

244
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:16,503
All right,get out of here.Both of you guys.

245
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,004
And I don't wanna seeyou in my office

Better watchyour back, white boy.

248
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,686
Jake.

249
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,324
You know, I heardabout your grandfather.

250
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:41,494
He was always interestedin how you were doingin school.

251
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:44,464
And he would alwayswant you to do your best.

252
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:45,698
I know.

253
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:49,336
Have a good day, Jake.

254
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:51,638
One more thing.

255
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,173
Did David tell youthere was somethinggoing on

256
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:56,543
between me and Richie?

257
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,778
Get to class, Jake.

258
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:34,614
You just couldn't waitto get me in trouble,huh, Jake?

259
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:37,550
Your little snitch friendhad to go and tellthe principal.

260
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:41,154
What? do you thinki told David to goget the principal?

261
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:42,822
Look, Richie,believe it or not,

262
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,358
we're not afraidof you or your friends.

263
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:48,628
Oh, you're not afraid?That's it you're askingfor it, white boy.

264
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:52,432
Then why do you alwayshave to have all theseguys around you?

265
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,067
Do you pay these guysfor protection or what?

266
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:56,436
- That's it!- Leave it alone

267
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:57,570

268
00:18:57,604 --> 00:18:59,539
( Overlapping shouting )

269
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:02,074

276
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,352
He saw it.

277
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:54,361
Look at that.Man can't even get a cupof coffee around here

278
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:56,363
without missingall the action.

279
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,769
Yes, sir.

280
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,504
Have a nice day.

281
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,341
Jake.

282
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,942
I'm here to help.

283
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:27,560
What's up, Richie?What's bothering you?

284
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:29,596
You haven't saida word since I got here.

285
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:31,831
That box

286
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:35,568
that Jake hadwith him today.

287
00:20:35,602 --> 00:20:36,903
When I opened it,

288
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:39,672
I got a weird feelingall over me.

289
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,274
What kindof weird feeling?

290
00:20:41,308 --> 00:20:44,877
I had a visionof a boy

291
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:47,280
- behind a rock, crying.- Oh, yeah.

292
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:49,682
My mom gets those,only she calls themhot flashes.

293
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:51,884
Dude,

294
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,386

295
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,322
( Video game beeps )

296
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:56,689
Not like that.

297
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,229
I had a peaceful feelingall over me.

298
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:09,702
I felt good.

299
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:11,270
I thinki'm just gonnahave to stay away

300
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:13,506
from that guy.

301
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,274
What are your plansfor today, Jake?

302
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:16,343
Anything special?

303
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:18,445
Nothing really.

304
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:20,447

Maybe Anna will.

328
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:20,767

Look.

366
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:57,924
I found outwhat's in here, look.

367
00:25:57,957 --> 00:26:00,660
What is that?

368
00:26:00,693 --> 00:26:02,595
It looks likea nail of some kind.

369
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,802
This is who I see.

370
00:26:11,638 --> 00:26:14,206
Do you thinkit could be oneof those nails?

371
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,042
You sure this iswho you see, Jake?

372
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,277
I thought you saidyou saw a little boyholding the box.

373
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,712
I do seea little boy.

374
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:21,914
I see a little boyholding the box,

375
00:26:21,948 --> 00:26:24,083
and I see the same boy,except a little older,crying behind a rock.

376
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:30,056
And then I see jesushanging on the cross.

377
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,759
- Do you believe me?- ( Door bell chimes )

378
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:43,602
Hi, Mrs. Casper,is Jake home?

379
00:26:43,636 --> 00:26:47,306
Yes, he is.You must be Anna.Come on in.

380
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:50,609
Let me takeyour coat.

381
00:26:50,643 --> 00:26:52,845
Thank you.

382
00:26:57,283 --> 00:26:58,785
Jake, Anna's here.

383
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,624
Hi.

384
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:06,859
Mother: Jake, what kind of pizza do you want me to order?

385
00:27:06,893 --> 00:27:08,828
Pepperoni is fine.

386
00:27:08,861 --> 00:27:10,663
- Is that okay with you?- Sure, that's fine.

387
00:27:10,697 --> 00:27:14,033
Awesome.there's somethingi want to show you.

388
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:16,068
Sit down.

389
00:27:27,113 --> 00:27:29,648
So how did you feelwhen you opened it?

390
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:32,151
I didn't feelanything.

391
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:34,120
Okay, look.

392
00:27:35,788 --> 00:27:37,256
There's somethingin here.( Knocks )

393
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:44,030
What is it?

394
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:46,232
Some kind of nail.

395
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,738
Jake, where didyou get this?

396
00:27:51,771 --> 00:27:53,105
I found itin my grandpa's store.

397
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:59,645
He dieda few weeks ago.

398
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:06,853
So you don'tfeel anythingwhen you hold the nail?

399
00:28:06,886 --> 00:28:11,690
No.what do you mean,jake?

400
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:12,925
Believe it or not,

401
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:17,964
when I open the box,i see a vision

402
00:28:17,997 --> 00:28:19,331
of a little boyholding it.

403
00:28:24,003 --> 00:28:26,238
I think I even seejesus hung on the cross.

404
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:33,712
When I hold the nail

405
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:35,948
I see a visionof the same boy,

406
00:28:35,982 --> 00:28:38,384
except a little bit older,holding the same box.

407
00:28:44,891 --> 00:28:47,059
It's like...

408
00:28:47,093 --> 00:28:49,395
It's like it'sin a different placein time.

409
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:52,231
Are you sure?

410
00:28:52,264 --> 00:28:54,466
I didn'tfeel anything?

411
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:59,005
- Have you had your momor anybody else open the box?- Yeah, but...

412
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:02,909
- The only person that feltanything was Richie.- Richie?

413
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:04,210
It's a long storyabout Richie.

414
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,950
That...

415
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:12,718
Is who I see on the cross.

416
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,991
Do you see the nailthrough his hand?

417
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,130
Could that nail bethe one that hung jesuson the cross?

418
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:27,934
I don't know.

419
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:29,869
Is that even possible?

420
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:31,203
I've never heardof anyone findingthe nails

421
00:29:31,237 --> 00:29:33,940
that crucified Jesus.

422
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:35,241
I mean, I've heardabout the shroud,

423
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:38,945
but that's about it.

424
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:42,248
I heard about it.

425
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:45,017
People still sayit's fake though.

426
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:57,129
I have a Bible in my roomthat my grandpa left me.

427
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:02,869
I think it has picturesof the crucifixion

428
00:30:02,902 --> 00:30:04,370
tell meabout this little boyyou see.

429
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:06,505
I told you,i see a visionof a little boy

430
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:10,409
playing with the box.And then the same boy,and the same box,

431
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:12,511
except a little older.

432
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:14,881
Crying behind a rock.

433
00:30:14,914 --> 00:30:17,049
Maybe the boy put the nailin the box,

434
00:30:17,083 --> 00:30:19,318
maybe he saw jesusbeing crucified.

435
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,454
I'll be right back.

436
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:29,962
( Door bell chimes )

437
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:32,031
Pizza's here.

438
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:38,905
- Hi.- your pizza.

439
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:40,306
Yes, how much?

440
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,408
- 144.95.- um, no there--

441
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,510
- 133.95.- there must be a mistake...

442
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:47,213
- 122.67.- it's supposedto be closer to 20 some...

443
00:30:47,246 --> 00:30:49,148
There's nomistake here, missy.

444
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:51,017
Hey frank,i got one giving usa hard time--

445
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,284
( laughs )there's no frankover there.

446
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:54,153
It's just me.

447
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:56,488
Okay, how muchdo I owe you?

448
00:30:58,257 --> 00:31:00,426
Seven bucks.

449
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:04,130
I have 30.

450
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:05,497
Keep the change.

451
00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:09,868
- Thank you.- Merry Christmas.

452
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:14,573
Jake: mom!

453
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,943
- Check this out.- What? The Bible?

454
00:31:16,976 --> 00:31:19,878
No, I found a noteinside of it.

455
00:31:28,187 --> 00:31:32,458
July 14, 1998.

456
00:31:32,491 --> 00:31:35,294
Today I'm writingthis to let whomeverfinds this letter

457
00:31:35,327 --> 00:31:37,396
know that it'sin my possession.

458
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:39,031
I have a small wooden box

459
00:31:39,065 --> 00:31:41,000
that is filled with some sort of something

460
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:42,534
that is beyond my comprehension.

461
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:47,239
You see the boxcontains nothing.

462
00:31:47,273 --> 00:31:49,875
Yet it feels likesomething is in it.

463
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,578
When I open the box, I immediately get a very peaceful

464
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:54,446
and beautiful feeling.

465
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,582
You might thinki'm crazy,

466
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:59,551
but this box is connectedto someone called holy.

467
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:03,422
It's a feeling that I can't describe.

468
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:07,994
When I open the box,i see Jesus hangingon the cross.

469
00:32:08,027 --> 00:32:12,531
I can see a young man holding this very box and crying.

470
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:16,302
While he's watching Jesus being crucified.

471
00:32:16,335 --> 00:32:19,438
I can't help but thinkof my Jake when I getthis feeling.

472
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:23,109
I'm not sure, but I believe this box is meant to be in Jake's possession.

473
00:32:23,142 --> 00:32:26,012
Carry out something that only he is meant to.

474
00:32:26,045 --> 00:32:27,479
I know that jakewill find this box,

475
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:30,116
just at the timehe needs it

476
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:32,384
to fulfill whateverhe has been calledto do.

477
00:32:37,323 --> 00:32:39,258
Jake, what do youthink this means?

478
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:45,397
Grandpa felt and sawwhat I feel and see.

479
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,637
What if grandpawas right?

480
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:53,272
What if i'msupposed to do somethingwith the box?

481
00:32:58,377 --> 00:33:00,346
But what?

482
00:33:00,379 --> 00:33:02,214
He never saidwhere he found it.

483
00:33:02,248 --> 00:33:04,116
What if someonegave it to him?

484
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:15,094
What if grandpa foundthe box where I found it?

485
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:18,464
What if he left it thereso I would find it?

486
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,700
Someone called holy.

487
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:24,002
What does thateven mean?

488
00:33:24,036 --> 00:33:27,406
Okay, there isan explanationfor all of this.

489
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:29,108
There has to be.

490
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:30,342
You told methat grandpa always talked

491
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:31,710
about peoplethat came into his shop.

492
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,547
Do you rememberanything about somebody

493
00:33:35,581 --> 00:33:37,949
that gave himthe box.

494
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:40,119
No. I don't rememberhim saying anything

495
00:33:40,152 --> 00:33:42,188
about anyonegiving him the box.

496
00:33:42,221 --> 00:33:43,989
Maybe somebodysold it to him.

497
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,624
( Sighs )i don't know,maybe he did--

498
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:48,094
I just don't understandhow I only know three people

499
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:51,963
that felt what I feltwhen I opened the box.

500
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:56,168
Why didn't you, Anna,or David feel anything?

501
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:58,370
Why just me, grandpa,and Richie?

502
00:33:58,404 --> 00:34:00,772
How do you know richiefeels what you feel,jake?

503
00:34:00,806 --> 00:34:03,575
Does he knowabout the box?

504
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:05,477
He opened it.

505
00:34:07,313 --> 00:34:08,480
He didn't sayanything, but...

506
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:14,720
I know he felt it.

507
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:16,522
That's whati don't understand,

508
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:19,091
Richie is nota nice guy.

509
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:20,492
Wait, is thatthe same Richie

510
00:34:20,526 --> 00:34:22,128
that cameto your birthday partywhen you were 10

511
00:34:22,161 --> 00:34:25,564
and poppedall of the balloons?That Richie?

512
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:30,068
- Wasn't he sickor something?- Yeah, that's him.

513
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:32,104
- ( Door bell chimes )- ( knocking )

514
00:34:32,138 --> 00:34:34,406
Looks like it's timefor me to go.

515
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,343
I'll get it.

516
00:34:37,376 --> 00:34:41,079
Look, don't tell my momthat Richie bullies me.

517
00:34:41,113 --> 00:34:42,648
She'll freak.

518
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:45,451
I'm Anna's sister,here to pick her up.

519
00:34:45,484 --> 00:34:46,718
Anna!

520
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:49,688
- Call me tomorrow, okay?- Anna.

521
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:53,792
- Ready to go home, punk?- I'm so sorry, I thoughtmy mom was picking me up.

522
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:55,694
- What does that mean?- Is this your sister?

523
00:34:55,727 --> 00:35:00,666
- You can pick me upif you want me to.- Yeah.

524
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:04,102
Jess, we gotta go.

525
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:08,106
Open the door.

526
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,376
You don't want meto come in, do you?

527
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:13,212
Oh is that him?Even you can do betterthan that.

528
00:35:13,245 --> 00:35:14,480
He's not my boyfriend.

529
00:35:14,513 --> 00:35:17,816
Right! later, boyfriend.

530
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:20,252
Anna: why do you always do this to me?

531
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,663
Maybe you shouldtalk to pastor mikeabout all of this.

532
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,469
Look, mom.

533
00:35:37,503 --> 00:35:40,539
I don't knowwhat to make of anyof this either, but

534
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:41,673
you know the last timei went to church

535
00:35:41,707 --> 00:35:43,209
was for grandpa'sfuneral.

536
00:35:48,347 --> 00:35:49,648
I just don't wantto go back to the place

537
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:52,884
I had to say goodbyeto him, you know?

538
00:35:52,918 --> 00:35:56,788
If you think you needto talk to pastor Mike,i can invite him over here.

539
00:35:56,822 --> 00:35:58,457
I'm gonna go to bed.

540
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,625
- Let me thinkabout it.- Okay.

541
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,327
Good night, honey.

542
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,661
Jake: good morning, mom.

543
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:04,863
- Good morning.- Did you get any sleep?

544
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:09,134
Uh no, not really.How about you?

545
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,802
Not really.

546
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:14,506
I opened the box,though.

547
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:20,712
There's somethingso powerful about it.

548
00:36:25,251 --> 00:36:28,254
It doesn'tscare me, though.

549
00:36:28,287 --> 00:36:30,822
Like I said,maybe you should talkto pastor Mike about that.

550
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:34,192
He can at leastgive you his opinion

551
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:37,896
about what you see and feelwhen you open the box.

552
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:43,802
Hey. I never thoughtabout this, but

553
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:47,239
this looksjust like Mrs. rousso.

554
00:36:47,273 --> 00:36:49,408
What?

555
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:51,477
Doesn't that lookjust like Mrs. rousso?

556
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,878
( Laughs )

557
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:54,580
Right?

558
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:57,249
Yeah, like a youngmrs. Rousso.

559
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:05,223
- That's it, mom.- What's it?

560
00:37:05,257 --> 00:37:06,892
Mrs. rousso.

561
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:09,361
Do you think she knowsanything about the box?

562
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:10,929
You said that herand grandpa werebest friends.

563
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:14,600
Didn't they get coffeelike every day?

564
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:16,201
Maybe she just nevertold us about the box

565
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:20,439
because we never asked.Come on.

566
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:21,807
Let's go.

567
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,610
Uh, give me a secondto get ready, will ya?

568
00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:27,546
( Sighs )

569
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:33,184
Richie, you better tellthe doctor everything,

570
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:35,387
because if you don't,i will.

571
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:38,790
Okay, I told you,i'm gonna tell themeverything.

572
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:42,561
The doctor willbe right in.

573
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:55,273
Mrs. leal.

574
00:37:55,307 --> 00:37:57,476
- It's nice to see you.- Nice to see you, doctor.

575
00:37:59,345 --> 00:38:00,879
There's Richie.How ya doing?

576
00:38:08,554 --> 00:38:10,221
Looks like you'velost some weight,

577
00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:12,858
how long haveyou had this cough?

578
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:15,761
I guess, I've had itfor a few days now--

579
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:18,697
he's had the coughfor a week.

580
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:21,467
- And he won't eat.- Ma, please!

581
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,470
Why aren'tyou eating, Richie?What's up with that?

582
00:38:24,503 --> 00:38:27,639
I'm just not hungrythese days.

583
00:38:33,512 --> 00:38:34,880
Connie, would youplease excuse us?

584
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,782
I need to takea good look at Richie.

585
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,717
Make yourself at homein the waiting area.

586
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,586
I'll come and get youwhen we're done.

587
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:51,463
Look, Richie.It looks like I'm gonnahave to admit you.

588
00:38:51,497 --> 00:38:53,932
I'm not takingany chances.

589
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:56,334
Come on, doc.It's Christmas time.

590
00:38:56,368 --> 00:38:58,870
I know.You wanna be homefor Christmas.

591
00:38:58,904 --> 00:39:01,840
I get it. But lookat the weather out here.

592
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:04,910
People are runningaround with coldand flu bugs.

593
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:06,277
Stuff like thatcould kill you.

594
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:08,914
And you know it.

595
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:10,616
I'll go outand I'll talk to mom,

596
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:12,718
and I'll let her knowwhat's going on.

597
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:14,420
We'll getthe paperwork started.

598
00:39:16,522 --> 00:39:17,756
Hang in there.

599
00:39:26,131 --> 00:39:27,566
- Need help with that, ma?- Oh, no thanks,

600
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,967
- I'm almost done.- All right.

601
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,702
Where's your coat?

602
00:39:30,736 --> 00:39:32,571
This is my coat.

603
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:33,872
( Laughs )all right look,

604
00:39:33,905 --> 00:39:36,408
I'm gonna go meetthe guys at the arcade.

605
00:39:36,442 --> 00:39:38,309
Those video gamesare a waste of time.

606
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:39,511
Would it kill youto read a book

607
00:39:39,545 --> 00:39:40,979
every once in a while?

608
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:42,681
It might.

609
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,716
I don't wantto take the chance.( Laughs )

610
00:39:49,955 --> 00:39:51,590
Richie, I knew it.

611
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:53,759
You're not well.

612
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:57,829
Ma, it's okay.I'll be in the hospitalfor just a few days.

613
00:39:57,863 --> 00:39:59,598
I'll be outby Christmas time.

614
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:03,469
( Coughs )

615
00:40:03,502 --> 00:40:07,606
You know, christmaswon't mean anything to mewithout you.

616
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:09,775
I just want youto be healthy.

617
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:11,710
( Door opens )

618
00:40:16,682 --> 00:40:18,917
Richie,this is some paperworkthat you and your mom

619
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:21,152
need to takeover to the first floor.

620
00:40:21,186 --> 00:40:23,354
From there,they will take youto your room.

621
00:40:23,388 --> 00:40:24,656
You know the routine.

622
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:26,658
I'm sorryyou have to be here.

623
00:40:26,692 --> 00:40:28,827
I hate this.

624
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,529
Mrs. rousso: What's this Jake tells me?

625
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:32,363
You havesome questions?

626
00:40:32,397 --> 00:40:33,999
Well, I thinkjake is the onewith the questions.

627
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:44,409
Huh.well, I knowthis box.

628
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,712
Your grandfathershowed it to me before.

629
00:40:46,745 --> 00:40:48,179
Did he giveit to you?

630
00:40:48,213 --> 00:40:52,951
No. no, he didn'texactly give it to me.

631
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:55,587
Open it.

632
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:57,122
I want youto open it.

633
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,738
Do you feelor see anythingwhen you open it?

634
00:41:13,872 --> 00:41:15,140
Have you calledyour father?

635
00:41:15,173 --> 00:41:19,177
His shift is almost donefor the day?

636
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:23,782
Yes, I called paco, too.

637
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:25,651
( Coughs )

638
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:31,122
Why don't yougo home, mom?

639
00:41:31,156 --> 00:41:33,424
I'll wait for dad.

640
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:35,727
I'll waitfor him, too.

641
00:41:35,761 --> 00:41:36,928
I'll go home later,

642
00:41:36,962 --> 00:41:40,131
I wanna talkto the doctor.

643
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:43,969
Is this room coldor is it just me?

644
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,241
Congratulations,mr. and Mrs. leal.

645
00:41:53,478 --> 00:41:55,747
Say hi,to your new mommyand daddy, Richie.

646
00:41:55,781 --> 00:41:57,816
Hello,mommy and daddy.

647
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:59,718
( Laughing )

648
00:41:59,751 --> 00:42:04,122
- He's beautiful.- He's perfect.

649
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:07,025
Welcome home, Richie.

650
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:13,264
Lord, please takecare of my son.

651
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:20,005
( Sighs )

652
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:22,040
Jake,

653
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:24,676
you felt whatyour grandfather felt

654
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:28,013
when he openedthis box.

655
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:30,716
You know,he even said,

656
00:42:30,749 --> 00:42:33,852
"i have no ideawhat heaven is like,

657
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:36,822
but if it feelslike it does when I openthe box,

658
00:42:36,855 --> 00:42:38,890
then I can't waitto get there."

659
00:42:38,924 --> 00:42:42,160
When he used to say,"i get a special feeling."

660
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:45,697
I thought he was losinghis mind or something.

661
00:42:45,731 --> 00:42:47,766
I mean, no offense,maggie, but...

662
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:48,967
None taken.

663
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,543
- Man, it's cold out there.- Yeah, I know.

664
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,045
Have you heardabout Richie?

665
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:02,914
No, what about him?

666
00:43:02,948 --> 00:43:04,616
He's in the hospital.

667
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,084
He's sick again.

668
00:43:06,117 --> 00:43:08,186
What do you mean,sick again?

669
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:11,156
Cancer's back.

670
00:43:11,189 --> 00:43:13,659
He's not doingtoo good.

671
00:43:13,692 --> 00:43:17,763
I mean... I meanit doesn't look good,you know?

672
00:43:17,796 --> 00:43:19,330
I have a bad feelingabout this.

673
00:43:19,364 --> 00:43:21,199
Hey, you wantto go see him, man?

674
00:43:21,232 --> 00:43:22,734
No.

675
00:43:22,768 --> 00:43:24,636
They won't let us in.

676
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:28,039
Besides, Richie said it'stoo far for us to go.

677
00:43:28,073 --> 00:43:30,008
Fine.

678
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:33,712
Now, let's go playthat boxing gameover there.

679
00:43:33,745 --> 00:43:35,546
The box.

680
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,783
What box?

681
00:43:37,816 --> 00:43:39,150
The box that Jake had.

682
00:43:39,184 --> 00:43:41,687
That Richie picked upoff the ground.

683
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,189
Remember whenthey fought at the schoolthe other day.

684
00:43:44,222 --> 00:43:46,792
Yeah, what about it?

685
00:43:46,825 --> 00:43:49,928
Well, that night,richie told me something.

686
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:51,897
It was reallybothering him.

687
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:54,766
He said thatwhen he opened the box,

688
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,068
something cameover him.

689
00:43:57,102 --> 00:43:59,170
Something...peaceful.

690
00:43:59,204 --> 00:44:00,605
That's crazy, man.

691
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,240
I don't knowwhat that means,

692
00:44:02,273 --> 00:44:05,343
but somethingtells me that we needto go find Jake.

693
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:07,713
Well do you knowwhere to find him?

694
00:44:07,746 --> 00:44:10,615
No. there's waysto find him.

695
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,284
Let's go.

696
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:16,654
Man, I still don't knowwhat that little boxcan do for Richie.

697
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,229
Did he ever mentionwhat was in the box?

698
00:44:24,262 --> 00:44:27,198
He always saidhe felt like the box

699
00:44:27,232 --> 00:44:30,268
held somethingspecial inside.

700
00:44:30,301 --> 00:44:32,370
Although, he nevercould find it.

701
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:33,671
And you know, the box,

702
00:44:33,705 --> 00:44:35,673
the box hadsome weight to it.

703
00:44:35,707 --> 00:44:38,043
I bet you twodon't know this.

704
00:44:38,076 --> 00:44:39,177
Your grandfathertook care

705
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:42,613
of a homeless manfor a while.

706
00:44:42,647 --> 00:44:44,215
He'd come in hereand he'd get his meals.

707
00:44:44,249 --> 00:44:46,417
And your grandfatherwould pay for it.

708
00:44:46,451 --> 00:44:50,621
He even let him stayin the back of his storefor a few weeks.

709
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:52,290
I bet you didn'tknow that, Maggie.

710
00:44:52,323 --> 00:44:53,925
Nope.

711
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:58,229
Anyway, the first timei saw that box,

712
00:44:58,263 --> 00:45:00,665
was shortly afterholy disappeared.

713
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,367
So I alwaysjust believed,

714
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,270
holy gave himthe box.

715
00:45:05,303 --> 00:45:08,139
He never mentionedanything like thatto me.

716
00:45:08,173 --> 00:45:10,641
Although, I guessit's because I probablywould have told dad

717
00:45:10,675 --> 00:45:12,744
to makethe homeless manleave the shop.

718
00:45:16,147 --> 00:45:18,817
Huh. well, I'll be.

719
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:22,754
He was right.

720
00:45:22,788 --> 00:45:24,655
There is somethingin there.

721
00:45:24,689 --> 00:45:26,892
What is it?

722
00:45:26,925 --> 00:45:28,159
I don't know.

723
00:45:32,163 --> 00:45:33,364
I think it'ssome kind of nail.

724
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:35,834
May I?

725
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:41,807
You know,just a few months

726
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,741
before your grandpapassed.

727
00:45:43,775 --> 00:45:47,278
He told me he wasgoing to hide the boxin the store.

728
00:45:47,312 --> 00:45:49,314
( Chuckles )and that if youhad anything

729
00:45:49,347 --> 00:45:51,682
to do with it, Jake,

730
00:45:51,716 --> 00:45:55,053
you would findthe box.

731
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,387
And he believed

732
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:59,357
somehowthe box would end upin your hands.

733
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:01,026
At justthe right time.

734
00:46:01,059 --> 00:46:04,095
You mentioned, holy.

735
00:46:04,129 --> 00:46:05,330
Was that the homelessguy's name?

736
00:46:09,134 --> 00:46:11,202
He saidhe was knownas holy.

737
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,342
Holy...like god holy,

738
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:21,146
or holey likeholey clothes.

739
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:23,314
When your grandfathertold me he was gonna

740
00:46:23,348 --> 00:46:25,183
let this guystay in his shop,

741
00:46:25,216 --> 00:46:28,887
I did my research.I went around

742
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,322
and I askeda lot of questions.

743
00:46:31,356 --> 00:46:34,492
And everyone I askedsaid he was harmless.

744
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:36,828
Just a kind old man.

745
00:46:42,267 --> 00:46:43,368
Hey mom, do youknow how Jesus

746
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:45,303
was nailedto the cross?

747
00:46:45,336 --> 00:46:49,374
Well, he diedso that you and icould have life.

748
00:46:49,407 --> 00:46:52,844
Yeah, I know that,but were the nails

749
00:46:52,878 --> 00:46:55,180
through his handsor his wrists.

750
00:46:55,213 --> 00:46:56,314
I'm not sure.

751
00:46:56,347 --> 00:46:57,748
I see some pictureswith the nails

752
00:46:57,782 --> 00:46:59,284
through his hands,and some pictures

753
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:01,853
with the nailsthrough his wrists.

754
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:04,055
I can't reallytell you any morethan I already know.

755
00:47:04,089 --> 00:47:06,524
Do you knowwhere holy is now?

756
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:09,160
You know,i can't say, Jake.

757
00:47:09,194 --> 00:47:11,863
After he leftyour grandpa's shop,

758
00:47:11,897 --> 00:47:14,099
nobody ever sawhim again. I mean...

759
00:47:14,132 --> 00:47:17,235
Seems likehe just disappeared.

760
00:47:18,436 --> 00:47:19,905
I asked about himfor a while,

761
00:47:19,938 --> 00:47:23,008
but nobody'sever seen him again.

762
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:24,242
He truly wasa kind old man

763
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:26,411
that never didany harm to anyone.

764
00:47:26,444 --> 00:47:28,213
And you knowanother thing,

765
00:47:28,246 --> 00:47:32,150
he used to hand outthese little woodencrosses,

766
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:33,784
I don't even knowwhere he got them.

767
00:47:33,818 --> 00:47:35,253
I we needto get going.I have to stop

768
00:47:35,286 --> 00:47:37,322
by the churchand drop offsome boxes.

769
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:39,857
- Okay.- thank you, so muchfor all of your time.

770
00:47:39,891 --> 00:47:42,193
- Oh thank you, Maggie.- Bye. We'll see youlater.

771
00:47:42,227 --> 00:47:44,229
You guystake care now.

772
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:51,536
His "sats"are really low,mrs. Leal.

773
00:47:51,569 --> 00:47:52,938
The doctor willbe in soon.

774
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:06,851
( Kisses )

775
00:48:07,986 --> 00:48:09,154

776
00:48:09,187 --> 00:48:11,322
Hi. I gotthe test results back.

777
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:17,062
It's not good.

778
00:48:20,331 --> 00:48:23,468
Looks likethe cancer is back.

779
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:26,604
I'm sorry.It's... it's bad.

780
00:48:30,075 --> 00:48:33,244
Please, tell me we canbeat the cancer again.

781
00:48:33,278 --> 00:48:35,846

I'll run more testsin the morning.

783
00:48:39,117 --> 00:48:43,354
But just so we're clearand all on the same page,he's a sick young man.

784
00:48:48,459 --> 00:48:51,029
Hi, dad.

I'm not feelingtoo well right now.

789
00:49:04,209 --> 00:49:06,444
What does the doctor say?

790
00:49:06,477 --> 00:49:10,348

Are you hungry,richie?

793
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,453

830
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,152

He's really sick.

841
00:51:16,307 --> 00:51:18,809
Did she saywhat hospital he's at?

842
00:51:18,843 --> 00:51:21,346

but I feel likehe's with me right now.

900
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,303
What'son your mind, Jake?

901
00:53:58,336 --> 00:53:59,504
It's about this.

902
00:54:03,308 --> 00:54:05,310
Do you knowwhat this box is,pastor?

903
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:17,422
Do you see anythingwhen you open it?

904
00:54:17,455 --> 00:54:19,657
Yes.

905
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:22,393
And I'm almost sureyou're going to tell methat you do too.

906
00:54:22,427 --> 00:54:23,794
Aren't you?

907
00:54:23,828 --> 00:54:26,364
I do.

908
00:54:26,397 --> 00:54:27,698
My grandfather feltsomething too,

909
00:54:27,732 --> 00:54:30,000
he wrote a letterabout it in his Bible.

910
00:54:30,034 --> 00:54:32,269
I know he did, Jake.

911
00:54:32,303 --> 00:54:34,305
I told himto write it.

912
00:54:34,339 --> 00:54:37,375
You see, this is notthe first time that i'veseen this box.

913
00:54:37,408 --> 00:54:39,844
A few years ago,your grandfather came byto see me

914
00:54:39,877 --> 00:54:41,779
and his brought this boxwith him.

915
00:54:41,812 --> 00:54:43,914
He told meall about it.

916
00:54:43,948 --> 00:54:45,850
Did he tell youabout holy?

917
00:54:45,883 --> 00:54:47,685
Or the nailthat's in it?

918
00:54:47,718 --> 00:54:50,721
Yes. I know about holy,he told me all about him.

919
00:54:50,755 --> 00:54:53,324
He never told meabout the nail.

920
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:55,259
May I seethe nail?

921
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:56,827
Sure, pastor.

922
00:54:59,664 --> 00:55:02,433
Would you lookat that?

923
00:55:02,467 --> 00:55:05,035
I guess your grandfathernever knew about this.

924
00:55:05,069 --> 00:55:07,938
- May I take it out?- Sure.

925
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:12,276
Like, wait.Holy, who is that?

926
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:15,646
He's some homeless guythat my grandfathertook care of.

927
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,849
And there'sanother thing,pastor.

928
00:55:18,883 --> 00:55:21,986
Why can'tdavid feel anythingwhen he opens the box?

929
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:25,490
It's not that davidisn't a good personor anything like that.

930
00:55:25,523 --> 00:55:28,826
We may never know whyonly some people can feelsomething with this box.

931
00:55:30,828 --> 00:55:34,298
Your grandfather told methat he had a dream.

932
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,601
That holy leftthis box with him

933
00:55:36,634 --> 00:55:38,769
in orderto get it to you.

934
00:55:38,803 --> 00:55:41,372
And he might be right.

935
00:55:41,406 --> 00:55:43,541
The lord couldbe using you to complete

936
00:55:43,574 --> 00:55:44,642
a purposewith this box?

937
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:46,577
For what purpose?

938
00:55:46,611 --> 00:55:48,546
I can't figure it out,i don't know what to dowith it.

939
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:52,450
( Phone rings )excuse me, gentlemen.

940
00:55:52,483 --> 00:55:55,386
It's pastor Mike.Hey, it's good to--

941
00:55:58,589 --> 00:56:02,460

942
00:56:05,763 --> 00:56:07,898
Absolutely. of course.I'll be there.

943
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,036
You too.

944
00:56:13,804 --> 00:56:17,341
Sorry about that, guys.Glad I took that call.

945
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,777
Jake, have you told maggieabout all of this?

946
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:22,480
Yeah. I told herabout everything.

947
00:56:22,513 --> 00:56:23,781
Well, have youlet her hold the box?

948
00:56:23,814 --> 00:56:25,516
Did she get any feelingsor see anything?

949
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:29,053
No. nothing.

950
00:56:29,086 --> 00:56:31,088
As far as I can tell,the only three peoplethat feel anything

951
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:32,957
are you, me and Richie.

952
00:56:32,990 --> 00:56:34,425
Richie?richie who?

953
00:56:34,459 --> 00:56:35,693
Richie leal.

954
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:37,895
How do you knowhe feels what you feel?

955
00:56:37,928 --> 00:56:41,098
I'm not too sure,although I heard todayhe's in the hospital.

956
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:43,400
And he's really sick.

957
00:56:43,434 --> 00:56:45,436
I got in a fightwith him a week agoand he opened the box.

958
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,343
I know this isgonna sound crazy,

959
00:56:53,377 --> 00:56:55,613
but I knowthat he felt something.I just know it.

960
00:56:55,646 --> 00:56:56,881
Jake,

961
00:56:58,716 --> 00:57:00,551
I just got off the phonewith Richie's dad.

962
00:57:00,585 --> 00:57:02,553
If this is the same richieyou're talking about,

963
00:57:02,587 --> 00:57:05,623
his leukemia is back,and he is very ill.

964
00:57:05,656 --> 00:57:08,626
Why would he call you?Do you know him?

965
00:57:08,659 --> 00:57:10,695
I've known richiesince he was just a kid.

966
00:57:10,728 --> 00:57:12,797
Richie and paco used to cometo vacation Bible school

967
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:15,733
every summer before youstarted coming to church.

968
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:18,903
That's it.

969
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:21,506
We need to getthe box to richieso he can get better.

970
00:57:25,743 --> 00:57:27,645
Can you give usa ride, pastor?

971
00:57:27,678 --> 00:57:29,079
You go tellyour mother what'sgoing on.

972
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:30,615
I'll meet youat the front door.

973
00:57:58,576 --> 00:58:01,478
I don't know, mom.I got a bad feelingabout Richie.

974
00:58:01,512 --> 00:58:04,481
I know what you mean.I talked to connieearlier today,

975
00:58:04,515 --> 00:58:07,151
she's really scaredfor Richie.

976
00:58:07,184 --> 00:58:08,719
Poor Connie.

977
00:58:08,753 --> 00:58:11,856
I think I mightgo see him tonight.

978
00:58:11,889 --> 00:58:13,423
I remember I usedto take care of Richie

979
00:58:13,457 --> 00:58:15,225
when he wasa little boy.

980
00:58:15,259 --> 00:58:17,061
Connie and richardboth had to work.

981
00:58:17,094 --> 00:58:18,663
They lived right downthe street.

982
00:58:18,696 --> 00:58:20,464
You rememberthat, paco?

983
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:24,001
You and richiewere a handfultogether.

984
00:58:24,034 --> 00:58:26,470
Man...

985
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,639
Jake betterget that boxto Richie.

986
00:58:28,673 --> 00:58:29,874
What box?

987
00:58:29,907 --> 00:58:31,776
Oh. nothing.

988
00:58:34,712 --> 00:58:37,815
( Cell phone rings )

989
00:58:41,151 --> 00:58:42,720
- Hello.- hey, it's me.

990
00:58:42,753 --> 00:58:45,155
David and Jake are at the hospital.

991
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:46,991
- They're where?- Yeah, I heard they went there with their pastor.

992
00:58:47,024 --> 00:58:48,659
You're kidding me!

993
00:58:48,693 --> 00:58:50,661
I have a feeling we need to get up there.

994
00:58:50,695 --> 00:58:52,830
Okay, yeah, I just gottaput my coat on.

995
00:58:52,863 --> 00:58:55,199
Okay. Anna and I will meet you up there.

996
00:58:55,232 --> 00:58:58,235
Sounds good.

997
00:58:58,268 --> 00:58:59,804
What's the matter?What's going on?

998
00:58:59,837 --> 00:59:01,672
I need to go see him.

999
00:59:01,706 --> 00:59:03,207
Is there somethingyou're not telling me,paco?

1000
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:10,147
Thank you.

1001
00:59:12,817 --> 00:59:14,985
Will the doctor be into see Richie?

1002
00:59:15,019 --> 00:59:16,987
It'll betomorrow morning.

1003
00:59:17,021 --> 00:59:19,724
He still is waitingfor more test resultsto come back in.

1004
00:59:19,757 --> 00:59:21,626
But he usually makeshis rounds pretty early,

1005
00:59:21,659 --> 00:59:24,228
so hopefullyrichie's results willbe back by then.

1006
00:59:24,261 --> 00:59:28,966
I know he's waitingfor those before he comesto talk to you.

1007
00:59:28,999 --> 00:59:31,101
Can we staywith him tonight?

1008
00:59:31,135 --> 00:59:34,772
Yeah... I need to gocall the doctor.

1009
00:59:34,805 --> 00:59:36,140
His "sats" are not good.

1010
00:59:37,675 --> 00:59:40,277
What do you mean"not good"?

1011
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,246
Um...let me go callthe doctor,

1012
00:59:42,279 --> 00:59:44,281
he might still be herein the hospital.

1013
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:46,083
And whatif he's not?

1014
00:59:46,116 --> 00:59:47,918
Mrs. leal, it's okay.We always have

1015
00:59:47,952 --> 00:59:49,987
a doctor on call,let me just go get him.

1016
01:00:01,766 --> 01:00:03,267
Connie, do youremember

1017
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:08,138
the day that weadopted Richie?

1018
01:00:08,172 --> 01:00:10,607
And I went downto the store and gotyou a coffee

1019
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:13,678
- like I did today.- You did that many times,richard.

1020
01:00:13,711 --> 01:00:16,013
- We were herewith Richie for weeks.- I know.

1021
01:00:16,046 --> 01:00:17,648
But the first time,

1022
01:00:17,682 --> 01:00:19,684
do you rememberwhat happened?

1023
01:00:19,717 --> 01:00:22,186
What happened?

1024
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:25,589
I was walkingto the store,

1025
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,892
and I saw an old man.

1026
01:00:27,925 --> 01:00:30,728
He was getting beat up really bad in an alley.

1027
01:00:30,761 --> 01:00:32,697
And I remember running towards him

1028
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:35,165
and the guys ran away.

1029
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:37,067
He was hurt really bad.

1030
01:00:37,101 --> 01:00:40,871
I picked him up and carried him to the hospital.

1031
01:00:40,905 --> 01:00:42,339
He was bleeding. And when they put him

1032
01:00:42,372 --> 01:00:44,709
on to the hospital bed,

1033
01:00:44,742 --> 01:00:49,346
a little wooden cross fell out of his pocket.

1034
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:51,215
And I remember him looking at me and saying

1035
01:00:51,248 --> 01:00:52,817
he would repay me someday,

1036
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:55,920
for the act of kindness.

1037
01:00:55,953 --> 01:00:57,955
Maggie: okay, I do remember that.

1038
01:00:57,988 --> 01:01:01,125
I was mad at youfor not bringing me backa coffee.

1039
01:01:01,158 --> 01:01:05,696
Yeah, I just rememberhow thankful he was.

1040
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:10,701
I wonder whateverhappened to him.

1041
01:01:10,735 --> 01:01:13,103
Who knows.

1042
01:01:30,054 --> 01:01:32,689
Good evening,we are here to seerichie leal,

1043
01:01:32,723 --> 01:01:34,158

1044
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:35,392
Can you tell us wherehis room is, please?

1045
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:37,194
It's aftervisiting hours.

1046
01:01:37,227 --> 01:01:38,628
And you won'tbe able to see himuntil tomorrow.

1047
01:01:38,662 --> 01:01:40,097
I know, it's notvisiting hours.

1048
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:42,132
But I'm a pastor,

1049
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:44,001
and Richie's fathercalled me to come and praywith them.

1050
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:46,804
So could youtell me what floorhe's on, please?

1051
01:01:46,837 --> 01:01:48,372
Oh, and that'sa great book

1052

you're reading,by the way.

1053
01:01:51,809 --> 01:01:53,377
( Sighs )

1054
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:55,279
You know the rules.

1055
01:01:55,312 --> 01:01:57,181
You're the only onethat can go up.

1056
01:01:57,214 --> 01:01:59,383
They have to stayin the downstairs...

1057
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:01,251
- Nurse, please!- Waiting room.

1058
01:02:01,285 --> 01:02:02,452
We haveto see, Richie.

1059
01:02:02,486 --> 01:02:04,188
I have somethinghe needs.

1060
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:05,689
Well, can they at leastride the elevator up with me

1061
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,724
and wait inthe waiting area there?

1062
01:02:07,758 --> 01:02:09,794
Look, I'm sorry.You know the rules.

1063
01:02:09,827 --> 01:02:13,363
Now are you borrowingthat book, because I cangive you one to keep.

1064
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,802
Look, it'sgetting late.

1065
01:02:17,835 --> 01:02:21,338
Now if I let themride up on the elevatorwith you,

1066
01:02:21,371 --> 01:02:25,275
they're going to findtheir way to Richie's room.

1067
01:02:25,309 --> 01:02:27,878
I was young once.

1068
01:02:27,912 --> 01:02:29,213
And I'm not stupid.

1069
01:02:31,982 --> 01:02:34,718
Would you like meto drop the book offtomorrow?

1070
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:37,888
I could stop by.

1071
01:02:37,922 --> 01:02:40,290
I want to getback to my book.

1072
01:02:40,324 --> 01:02:43,961
Now, I'll let themride up on the elevatorwith you.

1073
01:02:43,994 --> 01:02:48,098
But they have to stayin the upstairswaiting room.

01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:11,515
that the canceris no longer present?

1249
01:14:11,548 --> 01:14:13,182
Well we'redefinitely gonna needto run some more tests

1250
01:14:13,216 --> 01:14:15,485
in the morning,guaranteed,

1251
01:14:15,519 --> 01:14:18,154
but between all of usand the iv poll,

1252
01:14:18,187 --> 01:14:21,725
I've neversee anything like thisin my entire career.

1253
01:14:21,758 --> 01:14:23,527
If the cancerwere still here,

1254
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:25,128
the color wouldn'tbe back in his face.

1255
01:14:25,161 --> 01:14:27,163
And the his vitalswould not be backto normal.

1256
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:28,732
That I can tellyou for sure.

1257
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:35,905
You were very,very sick.

1258
01:14:35,939 --> 01:14:39,142
Are you sureyou're okay?

01:14:39,175 --> 01:14:40,610
Yeah, I feel fine.

1260
01:14:43,212 --> 01:14:45,915
I feel likei haven't eatenin days.

1261
01:14:45,949 --> 01:14:47,984
I'm so hungry.

1262
01:15:09,238 --> 01:15:11,007

You, my friend,have just been a partof a beautiful miracle.

1269
01:15:30,894 --> 01:15:32,528
Was it a dream?

1270
01:15:32,562 --> 01:15:33,763
Hey, guys.What's going on?

1271
01:15:38,301 --> 01:15:39,669

1273
01:15:42,772 --> 01:15:45,474
No, Richie.

1274
01:15:45,508 --> 01:15:47,010
It wasn't me,and you know it.

Except for you, Richie.

1285
01:16:18,708 --> 01:16:20,543

1286
01:16:22,646 --> 01:16:24,080

That box.

1296
01:17:01,718 --> 01:17:04,187
It's notthe box, sir.

1297
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:05,889
It's what'sin the box.

1298

And merry Christmas.

1302
01:17:22,939 --> 01:17:25,174
I'd like to startby sharing somethingwith all of you

1303
01:17:25,208 --> 01:17:28,011
that happenedjust a few days ago.

1304
01:17:28,044 --> 01:17:31,014
These kidsare about to tell youa true story,

1305
01:17:31,047 --> 01:17:34,017
of what Jesus christhas done for them.

1306
01:17:34,050 --> 01:17:36,986
I know,because I was there.

1307
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:39,923
So, let'sget started.

1308
01:17:39,956 --> 01:17:41,624
Jake?

1309
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,326
( Applause )

1310
01:17:49,098 --> 01:17:50,366
Thanks so much,pastor Mike.

1311
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:54,704
( Microphone feeds back )

1312
01:17:54,738 --> 01:17:57,606
Hello, everyone.

1313
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,809
My name isjake Casper.

1314
01:17:59,843 --> 01:18:03,212
Wow, there's a lotof people here today.

1315
01:18:10,286 --> 01:18:13,389
Well,it's been an amazing week,to say the least.

1316
01:18:28,104 --> 01:18:29,739
If you believethat Jesus christisn't performing

1317
01:18:29,773 --> 01:18:30,974
any miraclesthese days,

1318
01:18:34,143 --> 01:18:37,680
and it's impossibleto love even your worstenemies,

1319
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:39,783
sit back,

1320
01:18:39,816 --> 01:18:41,217
and listento our story.

1321
01:18:43,787 --> 01:18:46,055
A true story that beginswith a small wooden box.

1322
01:18:48,391 --> 01:18:49,893
I call itthe messenger's box.

1323
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:56,933
And somewhere

1324
01:18:56,966 --> 01:18:58,768
tucked awayin the atticsof our hearts,

1325
01:19:01,137 --> 01:19:02,972
we all havea messenger's box.

1326
01:19:07,143 --> 01:19:09,445
But make no mistake,it's not about the boxitself.

1327
01:19:11,948 --> 01:19:13,216
It's about what'sin the box.

1328
01:19:17,253 --> 01:19:19,755
And if you findyourself in a hopelesssituation today,

1329
01:19:22,725 --> 01:19:24,027
no matter what it is.

1330
01:19:26,963 --> 01:19:30,066
No matter how darkthat situation may seem.

1331
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:32,902
There is hope.

1332
01:19:35,404 --> 01:19:37,974
And that hope

1333
01:19:38,007 --> 01:19:39,375
is in Jesus Christ.

1334
01:19:43,479 --> 01:19:47,150
You see,

1335
01:19:47,183 --> 01:19:49,218
we are notguaranteed tomorrow,

1336
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:52,922
or even the next minute.

1337
01:19:55,892 --> 01:19:58,427
So after you hearour story,

1338
01:19:58,461 --> 01:20:00,396
I'd like eachand every one of you,

1339
01:20:00,429 --> 01:20:01,965
to answerthese questions.

1340
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:12,308
Have you foundyour messenger's box?

1341
01:20:18,114 --> 01:20:19,815
Have you opened it?

1342
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:29,258
And if you haven't,

1343
01:20:35,131 --> 01:20:36,365

1344
01:20:40,136 --> 01:20:45,008
