Aah!

13
00:05:08,067 --> 00:05:10,600
Take her to the outskirts.

14
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,267
No one must know
who she is.

15
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:24,367
When it is Chandra's time,

16
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:26,967
the medallion
will let you know.

17
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:30,067
Now go.

18
00:05:31,867 --> 00:05:33,100
Be careful.

19
00:05:36,367 --> 00:05:39,100

We're really
brothers, my friend.

24
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:27,367
Look into your mind
and see the other.

25
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:30,567
You know who he is.

26
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:38,100
The other--
you remember him,
don't you?

27
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,767
He is really you.
The other.

34
00:12:23,267 --> 00:12:27,267
Chandra,
you won't remember me,

35
00:12:27,267 --> 00:12:29,767
but when it is your time,

36
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:32,200
the protectors
will come for you.

37
00:13:23,267 --> 00:13:24,467
Let's go, Sebastian!

38
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,200
Come on!

39
00:13:57,433 --> 00:13:58,933
You're late, Paul.

40
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:02,800
There's still
a lot of resistance
about your going,

41
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,700
but the governmental
guard came through

42
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,833
and gave
their approval.

43
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,700
I spent six years
researching this, Paul.

44
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,233
I could waste
years researching

45
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:13,933
what was completed
and documented

46
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:15,867
over 30 years ago
in the city.

47
00:14:15,867 --> 00:14:18,867
Prototype was
nobly conceived
and badly executed.

48
00:14:18,867 --> 00:14:22,367
And the last I spoke
with Professor Phelps,
he agrees

49
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:24,333
that no one here
will censor
your decision to go.

50
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,067
Dr. Zalazny.

51
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:33,600
Yes?

52
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,533
Be careful.

53
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:41,933
This time,
it's my program.

54
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,067
Where's Sebastian?

55
00:15:24,067 --> 00:15:26,433
I don't know. Why?

56
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,633
He's playing the chip
with my fucking money.

57
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,133
Did he win?

58
00:15:40,133 --> 00:15:42,200
If he's processing,
they'll kill him.

59
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,400
If I catch him,
I'll kill him.

60
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,900
I don't think he's
processing.

61
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,400
He left it with me
to fix it.

62
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,900
Kid's damn lucky.

63
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,667
The thing
stopped a bullet
the other day.

64
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:55,367
I'm glad you think
this is so funny.

65
00:15:55,367 --> 00:16:00,067
You can help me find him
and bury the little shit.

66
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:03,067
Listen, I care about him
just as much as you do,

67
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:06,467
so don't make me
feel guilty for
trying to help him.

68
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:10,067
He'd process
with or without
my help.

69
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:15,667
So, let's talk about
something else.

70
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:17,167
Oh, yeah?
What's that?

71
00:16:17,167 --> 00:16:18,733
You, uh...

72
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:22,067
You found yourself
another place
to live yet?

73
00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:25,833
We're going to go over
this again?

74
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,633
I got more than enough room
for you to stay here.

75
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:30,133
Have you ever heard
the term,

76
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:33,600
"You're beating a dead dog
with a broken stick"?

77
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,500
I'm just offering you
a place to stay.

78
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,933
You don't have to be
reading so much into it.

79

Hey!

80
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,667
I got something
for you today.

81
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:55,333
Thanks.

82
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:57,500
I have to find
Sebastian.

84
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,200
Tie me up, Hawkins.
Spank me.

I like a man who's hairy.

00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,667
Fuck me, Hawkins.

Aah!

The city is not
a very safe place

90
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:35,300
for a woman by herself.

91
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,300
I assumed I wouldn't
attract as much attention

92
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,200
if I came alone.

93
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,067
Are you Taurence?

94
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:46,233
You are a very
daring woman.

Your still being alive

96
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:50,567

98
00:20:55,467 --> 00:20:57,633

Yes.

104
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,667
Yes.

105
00:22:12,367 --> 00:22:15,300
There's no access panel.

106

of the program?

The third level
of the program, please?

The operational
program

109
00:23:36,933 --> 00:23:38,933
should answer
your question.

110
00:23:38,933 --> 00:23:41,433
I have a question
for you.

111
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:43,067
Yes, doctor?

112
00:23:43,067 --> 00:23:46,500
It seems they disappeared
without any explanation.

113
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,933
Who?

114
00:23:47,933 --> 00:23:49,933
Dr. Roberts
and his team.

115
00:23:49,933 --> 00:23:54,333
That would be
a better question
for Dr. Roberts.

116
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:57,367
He hasn't been seen
in 30 years.

117
00:23:58,933 --> 00:24:00,933
Sorry to hear that.

118
00:24:02,967 --> 00:24:05,100
I am going to need
an assistant.

I'll help you,
Dr. Zalazny.

There's
a sleeping room
down the hall.

121
00:24:13,867 --> 00:24:16,867
I suggest you stay
in the building.

122
00:24:16,867 --> 00:24:18,933
It wouldn't be wise
to go out.

123

your advice.

You are an addict,

and your total effort in life

132

is to obtain money
to feed your habit.

Now you're launched

on a full-scale teen-age
crime wave of your very own,

you feel let down
and tired,

136

but more persuasion,
a greater need to belong,

137
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:12,667
and it isn't long
until you try again.

138
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:14,167
You try new things,

and benzedrine, or bennies.

144
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:28,267
You begin to lose track
of your friends

145
00:27:28,267 --> 00:27:30,400
because now you belong
to a group,

146
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,833

a veiled world of secrecy.

You shouldn't
fool with Delaney.

Yep...

But I don't think
I'm gonna give it
to you.

Why not?

162
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,967
Because if they
catch you
processing again,

they're gonna cut
your balls off
and sell them.

00:29:30,933 --> 00:29:33,933
and live a life
of degradation and crime.

184
00:29:33,933 --> 00:29:38,267
Demon, I shall exorcise
the devil out of you.

185
00:29:40,367 --> 00:29:41,933
Delaney!

186
00:29:41,933 --> 00:29:44,767
Put the gun down.
Let the kid go.

187
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:47,633
It is the task put to me
by the Holy Father

188
00:29:47,633 --> 00:29:50,900
to cleanse the evil
of this evildoer!

189
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:53,100
Come on, Delaney.
Put the gun down!

190
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,200
He's just a kid!

191
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,767
Shish kebab, gypsy.

192
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:00,933
Ah! My eyes!

193
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:02,267
Oh!

194
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:10,833
Oh! My knee!

195
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:12,833
You suffering bastard, you!

196
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:15,633
Why--

197
00:30:15,633 --> 00:30:17,200
Joe!

198
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,700
You suffering demon,

199
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,700
I told you
not to sleep here.

200
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,900
Wake up!

201
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,533
Remove your sinful body
from my hotel.

202
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:27,033
He-- he's dead.

203
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,167
Dead?

204
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:29,200
Dead.

205
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,800
What do you
mean, dead?

206
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,167
He hasn't paid
his rent.

207
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:10,900
Damn.

208
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,933
Damn.

209
00:31:11,933 --> 00:31:13,500
I'm telling you.

210
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,567
Damn.

211
00:31:14,567 --> 00:31:15,933
Mine!

212
00:31:15,933 --> 00:31:18,100
One more--
one more chance.

213
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:21,067
That's all I need.

214
00:31:30,967 --> 00:31:32,567
Yo, girl.

215
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:35,433
Remember, you got
to give my boy
Action a whirl.

216
00:31:35,433 --> 00:31:37,800
I ain't doing shit
until I get my chip!

217
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:42,267
I ain't touching you
until you put on a rubber.

218
00:31:47,867 --> 00:31:49,133
Yo, Action...

219
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:50,667
Use my skin.

220
00:31:54,767 --> 00:31:55,833
[Beeping]

221
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:26,433
[Hawkins]
Hey, you ditch-drain bastards!

222
00:32:26,433 --> 00:32:27,900
Come on, motherfuckers!

223
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,367
Hey, you! Yeah, you!

224
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:31,700
Goddamn assholes!

225
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,767
Come on!

226
00:32:43,067 --> 00:32:45,167
Oh, yeah, gimp.

227
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,633
Kick his ass!

228
00:32:53,467 --> 00:32:54,667
Oh.

229
00:33:34,933 --> 00:33:36,133
[Beep beep beep]

230
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,733
I'm tired, Hawk.

231
00:35:56,367 --> 00:35:57,633
[Alarm sounds]

232
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:51,600
What are you doing?

233
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,667
Can't feel anything,
can you?

234
00:37:59,633 --> 00:38:01,933
What are you
talking about?

235
00:38:01,933 --> 00:38:03,767
Your legs.

236
00:38:03,767 --> 00:38:05,900
You can't feel anything
in your legs.

237
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:09,200
No. No, I can't feel
anything in my legs.

238
00:38:12,233 --> 00:38:14,067
How far up?

239
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:15,567
It's just my legs.

240
00:38:15,567 --> 00:38:18,633
I can't feel
anything in my legs.

241
00:38:18,633 --> 00:38:19,700
You know what I mean.

242
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:24,900
What are you
asking me that for?

243
00:39:12,067 --> 00:39:13,733
You know how sometimes
when you dream,

244
00:39:13,733 --> 00:39:15,867
you can't remember

245
00:39:15,867 --> 00:39:20,233
whether it's in
black and white or in color?

246
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:21,967
That's how I feel
with you, Hawk.

247
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,900
When I dream of you,

248
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,633
I can't remember
if you're in your chair

249
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:29,667
or if you're walking.

250
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,667
I think you're walking
in my dreams.

251
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,167
So tell me, Hawkins.

252
00:41:18,167 --> 00:41:20,433
Do you want
to walk again?

253
00:41:20,433 --> 00:41:21,867
No, doctor.

254
00:41:21,867 --> 00:41:24,300
I like sitting here,
pissing in my pants.

255
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,367
I guess I made
a mistake.

256
00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:31,100
I chose
the wrong guy.

257
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:44,567
So, why are you
offering me this gift?

258
00:41:47,167 --> 00:41:49,733
It's not a gift,
Hawkins.

259
00:41:49,733 --> 00:41:51,700
It's a process.

260
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,900
It's a process
called rebirth

261
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,233
that involves
the regeneration

262
00:41:55,233 --> 00:41:56,433
of your mind
and body.

263
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,067
You don't mind if I
smoke, do you,
Hawkins?

264
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:18,367
So...

265
00:42:18,367 --> 00:42:20,067
You want me
to think about it.

266
00:42:20,067 --> 00:42:22,100
No.

267
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,800
Here's the card.

268
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,300
Be there tomorrow,

269
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,833
10 A.M.

270
00:42:27,833 --> 00:42:30,700
If you're not there,
I'll find somebody else.

271
00:42:34,233 --> 00:42:36,500
When I--
when I come out--

272
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,800
rebirth.

273
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,433
What-- what do you
mean by rebirth?

274
00:42:43,733 --> 00:42:46,067
Your body will be
regenerated.

275
00:42:46,067 --> 00:42:48,800
The cybernetic suit will
let you live and
breathe.

276
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,467
But what about me?

277
00:42:51,467 --> 00:42:53,533
What happens to my mind,

278
00:42:53,533 --> 00:42:56,067
my memories?

279
00:42:57,067 --> 00:42:59,767
We'll record them,

280
00:42:59,767 --> 00:43:01,967
and then we'll
re-implant them.

281
00:43:01,967 --> 00:43:04,667
What about the memories
that I've forgotten,

282
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:06,467
the ones we don't record,

283
00:43:06,467 --> 00:43:08,500
like my subconscious?

284
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,633
What happens to them?

285
00:43:11,633 --> 00:43:14,333
If you don't remember
them, Hawkins,

286
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:16,433
then they really aren't
important, are they?

287
00:43:34,433 --> 00:43:36,133
Get lost.

288
00:43:50,233 --> 00:43:52,067
Damn it!

289
00:43:52,067 --> 00:43:54,067
Double down.
Four across.

290
00:43:54,067 --> 00:43:55,200
Chippy chips.

291
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,467
You owe me
another 50!

292
00:43:57,467 --> 00:44:00,333
You son of a bitch!

293
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:02,067
You're processing!
I know it!

294
00:44:02,067 --> 00:44:03,167
Ooh.

295
00:44:07,267 --> 00:44:09,233
Ha ha! Ho ho!

296
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:11,200
Oh! Oh! Oh!

297
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,867
Oh! Oh! Oh!

298
00:44:12,867 --> 00:44:15,067
Ahh. Ahh. Oh.

299
00:44:15,067 --> 00:44:17,500
Oh. Oh.

300
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,267
You mind
if I take his play?

301
00:44:20,267 --> 00:44:21,433
You...

302
00:44:21,433 --> 00:44:23,767
Think you're
a p-p-p-p-player.

303
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:27,233
Street rat.

304
00:44:27,233 --> 00:44:28,933
Go ahead.
Let him play.

305
00:44:28,933 --> 00:44:31,267
Let him play.

306
00:44:31,267 --> 00:44:32,467
Want to play?

307
00:44:33,167 --> 00:44:34,467
Let's play.

308
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,633
Tie me up.

309
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,600
Spank me.

310
00:44:53,933 --> 00:44:54,967
Fags.

311
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:04,900
Three down.
Split them up.

312
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:18,267
The cards didn't fall
the right way for you.

313
00:45:18,267 --> 00:45:21,900
You got real lucky,
street boy,

314
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,300
real lucky,

315
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,933
but don't-- but don't--
but don't think

316
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:29,533
it's going to keep
coming that way.

317
00:46:06,067 --> 00:46:08,567
Shit!

318
00:46:08,567 --> 00:46:12,100
Four down.
Four across.

319
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,500
Take all.

320
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,200
All right, you little
street faggot!

321
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,933
Your streak is over!

322
00:46:19,933 --> 00:46:21,100
Over.

323
00:46:25,267 --> 00:46:26,367
Call card.

324
00:46:31,633 --> 00:46:32,933
[Beeping]

325
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:41,500
All right.

326
00:46:43,833 --> 00:46:44,967
Three of diamonds.

327
00:46:46,533 --> 00:46:47,600
Three of diamonds.

328
00:46:55,533 --> 00:46:58,067
You little bastard!

329
00:46:58,067 --> 00:47:01,433
You're processing me.

330
00:47:01,433 --> 00:47:02,733
I ain't processing you,

331
00:47:02,733 --> 00:47:04,500
you stupid
s-s-s-sack of shit!

332
00:47:08,333 --> 00:47:09,800
Hey!

333
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,433
Play the hand.

334
00:47:13,267 --> 00:47:15,367
No p-p-p-processor.

335
00:47:15,367 --> 00:47:16,900
Play the hand.

336
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:19,233
Tell the little punk
to keep away.

337
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:45,467
Three down.

338
00:47:45,467 --> 00:47:47,367
Four across.

339
00:47:47,367 --> 00:47:48,600
Double down.

340
00:48:00,567 --> 00:48:01,567
Call card.

341
00:48:09,067 --> 00:48:10,133
Three of hearts.

342
00:48:17,133 --> 00:48:21,067
You little
b-b-b-b-bitch!

343
00:48:21,067 --> 00:48:21,933
You fucked
with the cards.

344
00:48:37,767 --> 00:48:38,900
[Crack]

345
00:48:42,267 --> 00:48:43,333
Come on!

346
00:49:03,067 --> 00:49:04,067
[Crack]

347
00:49:14,467 --> 00:49:15,533
Stupid!

348
00:49:15,533 --> 00:49:16,467
What did I--

349
00:49:55,767 --> 00:49:58,067
They could have killed you
in there, Sebastian!

350
00:49:58,067 --> 00:50:01,967
So, if I
did die,

351
00:50:01,967 --> 00:50:04,800
would you
place a red rose
on my chest

352
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,100
and kiss me
before they
close the lid?

353
00:50:24,167 --> 00:50:26,100
Next time, they're
going to blow you away.

354
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,267
No one's going to
blow me away.

355
00:50:30,267 --> 00:50:32,367
Besides, the mute
decided to be

356
00:50:32,367 --> 00:50:35,667
our big brother
protector.

357
00:50:35,667 --> 00:50:38,167
You stay away from them,
do you understand me?

358
00:50:38,167 --> 00:50:39,800
Don't get your feathers
ruffled over it.

359
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,000
He's not my type.

360
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,567
Do you understand?

361
00:50:42,567 --> 00:50:44,167
Yeah! All right!

362
00:50:44,167 --> 00:50:45,900
Good.

363
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,933
The next time you steal
my chip, Sebash,

364
00:50:47,933 --> 00:50:49,033
I'm going to
fucking kill you!

365
00:50:52,033 --> 00:50:53,467
It's Sebastian!

366
00:50:55,567 --> 00:50:57,000
Sam Sebastian to you.

367
00:51:08,833 --> 00:51:09,833

Hawkins, you okay?

369
00:51:21,433 --> 00:51:23,967
Are you all right?

370
00:51:23,967 --> 00:51:24,967
You were right.

371
00:51:27,333 --> 00:51:30,467
Right? What are you
talking about?

372
00:51:30,467 --> 00:51:32,400
Dreams.

373
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,067
Dreams?
What do you mean?

374
00:51:35,067 --> 00:51:36,967
When I dream,

375
00:51:36,967 --> 00:51:41,400
I don't remember if I'm
in my chair or I'm walking.

376
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,667
Hawkins, what are you
talking about?

377
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:44,967
If I could walk,

378
00:51:44,967 --> 00:51:46,967
things would be different.

379
00:51:46,967 --> 00:51:48,900
Wouldn't they?

380
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,467
Yeah. You'd be
at the Agency.

381
00:51:50,467 --> 00:51:51,700
I wouldn't know you.

382
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:52,833
No!

383
00:51:55,467 --> 00:51:57,333
I mean between us.

384
00:52:07,967 --> 00:52:09,767
I don't think this
is the time to
talk about that.

385
00:52:09,767 --> 00:52:10,800
Why?

386
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,667
Because I don't want
to deal with this!

387
00:52:13,667 --> 00:52:15,233
Do you love me, Chandra?

388
00:52:15,233 --> 00:52:17,167
I don't want
to deal with this!

389
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,700
Hawkins, I told you
there can be nothing
between us!

390
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:22,867
But if I could walk...

391
00:52:22,867 --> 00:52:24,500
Damn it, Hawkins.

392
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,967
You had to do it,
you had to change
things.

393
00:52:26,967 --> 00:52:28,667
Wait-- I got something
I want to give you.

394
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:37,100
Here, take it.

395
00:52:38,567 --> 00:52:40,433
Hawkins, I don't
want your gun.

396
00:52:40,433 --> 00:52:41,500
Take it!

I don't want
your gun!

If you don'tremember
them, Hawkins,

then they really
aren't important.

412
00:56:05,333 --> 00:56:09,067

413
00:56:09,067 --> 00:56:10,400
I guess we are.

to become acclimated
to the suit.

is he dead?

No.

mean "here"?

It was an experiment.

I wanted to walk.

be my father?

old enough to understand.

We were taken out
of the cities

514
01:08:00,267 --> 01:08:02,667
and implanted.

515
01:08:02,667 --> 01:08:04,967
It was meant to turn us
into teachers,

517
01:08:07,233 --> 01:08:09,533
We were called a lot of things,

518
01:08:09,533 --> 01:08:11,367
and then we were brought
back to the cities

519
01:08:11,367 --> 01:08:13,867
to become leaders.

520
01:08:13,867 --> 01:08:16,267

They're all gone.

at birth,

522

523

become our leader.

They are the protectors.

527

They have been raised to
sacrifice their lives for you.

01:08:40,433 --> 01:08:41,500

You are an omega now.

It will take some time,

532
01:08:47,967 --> 01:08:50,367

the powers that lay dormant.

01:13:42,267 --> 01:13:45,233
to the medical
aspects of
prototype.

557
01:13:45,233 --> 01:13:46,600
You've known all along.

558
01:13:49,367 --> 01:13:50,433
What did you think
happened

559
01:13:50,433 --> 01:13:53,033
to the medical
program?

560
01:13:53,033 --> 01:13:54,167
You think they
passed out of existence

561
01:13:54,167 --> 01:13:56,367
like dinosaurs?

562
01:14:00,767 --> 01:14:02,400
Unsuccessful implants?

563
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,800
Failure of
the omega interface?

564
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,767
It's all bullshit,
isn't it, Taurence?

565
01:14:06,767 --> 01:14:08,700
Bullshit?

566
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:11,233
The program was
a failure, doctor.

567
01:14:11,233 --> 01:14:12,700
Ridiculous.

568
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:14,833
The omegas did
successfully adapt

569
01:14:14,833 --> 01:14:16,933
to their implants.

570
01:14:16,933 --> 01:14:19,400
Their failure was in
the overriding

571
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:23,100
of the primary
programming directives.

572
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:24,367
So the government
created prototype

573
01:14:24,367 --> 01:14:26,467
to assassinate
the omegas?

574
01:14:26,467 --> 01:14:28,167
Assassination,
doctor?

575
01:14:28,167 --> 01:14:31,700
Prototypes weren't
designed as assassins.

576
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:34,767
They were the next
step in cybernetics.

577
01:14:34,767 --> 01:14:37,367
Total rebirth.

578
01:14:37,367 --> 01:14:41,367
100% cybernetically
integrated entities.

579
01:14:41,367 --> 01:14:43,600
It was
an assassination program.

580
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,267
It was the logical
conclusion

581
01:14:45,267 --> 01:14:46,400
to an experiment

582
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:50,000
that had gone
out of control,
doctor.

583
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,500
That was
over 20 years ago.

584
01:14:53,867 --> 01:14:55,833
Yes, doctor.

585
01:14:55,833 --> 01:14:59,000
A different time.

586
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,200
A time you're not
familiar with

587
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:05,533
or able to judge.

588
01:15:05,533 --> 01:15:07,400
Maybe you're right,
Taurence,

589
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:08,600
but why would
the government

590
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,833
let me come here and re-create
another prototype?

591
01:15:10,833 --> 01:15:11,833
You came here

592
01:15:11,833 --> 01:15:14,633
for medical
research, doctor.

593
01:15:14,633 --> 01:15:16,567
Your unsealing of
the prototype lab

594
01:15:16,567 --> 01:15:18,767
will assist us
in the conclusion

595
01:15:18,767 --> 01:15:22,100
of the program
it was intended to.

596
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:24,367
The conclusion
of what program?

597
01:15:24,367 --> 01:15:25,533
What are you
talking about?

598
01:15:28,433 --> 01:15:29,633
Omega, doctor.

599
01:15:32,367 --> 01:15:35,367
There is one left.

600
01:15:35,367 --> 01:15:38,633
One that was
implanted at birth.

601
01:15:38,633 --> 01:15:41,667
One that I believe
remains inactivated

602
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:44,367
until now.

603
01:15:44,367 --> 01:15:46,367
You see, doctor,

604
01:15:46,367 --> 01:15:47,933
we couldn't allow
the same mistake

605
01:15:47,933 --> 01:15:49,733
to plague us again.

606
01:15:53,267 --> 01:15:55,867
Am I going to get
out of here alive, Taurence?

607
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:00,900
Aren't you being
a bit overly dramatic,

608
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:04,367
Dr. Zalazny?

609
01:16:04,367 --> 01:16:06,067
It's like the stories
of the people

610
01:16:06,067 --> 01:16:09,233
that hunted down the
Nazis in the Second
World War.

611
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:13,633
History to most...

612
01:16:18,133 --> 01:16:20,200
Except the hunters.

613
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:33,367
Dr. T. Roberts.

614
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:38,100
Dr. Taurence Roberts.

615
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:39,733
It's you, isn't it?

616
01:16:45,533 --> 01:16:47,767
Yes, doctor.

617
01:16:47,767 --> 01:16:48,767
Where are you going?

618
01:16:51,133 --> 01:16:53,367
Home.

619
01:16:53,367 --> 01:16:55,367
Where else
would I be going?

620
01:16:56,767 --> 01:16:58,200
My work
is completed here.

621
01:17:01,367 --> 01:17:03,000
Good night, doctor.

622
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:05,700
Uh, yeah.

623
01:17:07,433 --> 01:17:08,767
Good night.

624
01:18:13,367 --> 01:18:14,533
What are you
doing here?

625
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,667
I said,
what are you doing?

626
01:18:18,667 --> 01:18:21,633
What does it
look like I'm doing?

627
01:18:21,633 --> 01:18:23,267
It looks like
you're leaving.

628
01:18:25,533 --> 01:18:27,400
Well, are you?

629
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,367
Yes, I'm leaving.

630
01:18:30,833 --> 01:18:32,833
Did I do something?

631
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:34,867
No.

632
01:18:36,367 --> 01:18:38,200
I have to go away with
some people for a while.

633
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,933
Why... why?

634
01:18:40,933 --> 01:18:42,467
Look!

635
01:18:42,467 --> 01:18:45,467
I can't stay here,
all right?

636
01:18:45,467 --> 01:18:46,467
We can't pretend

637
01:18:46,467 --> 01:18:47,867
we're brother
and sister anymore!

638
01:18:52,433 --> 01:18:54,467
You understand?

639
01:18:54,467 --> 01:18:56,000
Don't follow me.

640
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:09,933
Stupid bitch.

641
01:19:44,433 --> 01:19:45,833
The A01

642
01:19:45,833 --> 01:19:48,600
or the A002 programs
will not operate

643
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:52,167
without the omega
shell program.

644
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:53,767
Can I leave
the suit

645
01:19:53,767 --> 01:19:55,467
and return
to what I was?

646
01:19:55,467 --> 01:19:56,767
No.

647
01:19:56,767 --> 01:19:58,300
You will die.

648
01:19:58,300 --> 01:19:59,333
To live,

649
01:19:59,333 --> 01:20:01,933
I must eliminate
the omega signal.

650
01:20:01,933 --> 01:20:04,200
Yes.

651
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:08,833
Why was I created?

652
01:20:08,833 --> 01:20:10,067
You were reborn

653
01:20:10,067 --> 01:20:13,267
to carry out
the omega program, Hawkins.

654
01:20:13,267 --> 01:20:16,767
I am no longer
the same Hawkins.

655
01:20:16,767 --> 01:20:19,067
It will take time.

656
01:20:19,067 --> 01:20:20,767
You will acclimate
to your environment

657
01:20:20,767 --> 01:20:23,300
in the suit.

658
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:25,800
One day, you may be able
to live outside of it.

659
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:27,833
It will not be
the same Hawkins

660
01:20:27,833 --> 01:20:30,500
that leaves
the suit.

661
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:33,867
If I die, will you
build another?

662
01:20:33,867 --> 01:20:35,700
Yes,

663
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:39,133
I will build another.

664
01:20:39,133 --> 01:20:41,733
30 years ago,

665
01:20:41,733 --> 01:20:44,067
the government
ended the program

666
01:20:44,067 --> 01:20:45,833
and sealed the lab.

667
01:20:49,067 --> 01:20:52,133
Dr. Zalazny's research

668
01:20:52,133 --> 01:20:54,800
has allowed me
to complete my work.

669
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:56,467
Yes.

670
01:20:56,467 --> 01:20:59,067
I understand.

671
01:20:59,067 --> 01:21:00,967
I...

672
01:21:00,967 --> 01:21:02,733
I am alone.

673
01:21:05,767 --> 01:21:07,133
We are all alone, Hawkins.

674
01:21:43,867 --> 01:21:45,000
No!

675
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:47,367
No!

676
01:21:48,633 --> 01:21:49,667
No!

677
01:21:51,567 --> 01:21:54,167
Aah!

678
01:21:54,167 --> 01:21:55,367
Aah!

679
01:23:01,033 --> 01:23:02,533
You need me, Hawkins!

680
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,033
No!

681
01:26:25,900 --> 01:26:27,500
[Back cracks]

682
01:28:26,367 --> 01:28:28,467
[Metal cracking]

683
01:28:31,367 --> 01:28:32,667
Don't kill him!

684
01:29:56,533 --> 01:29:57,533
Chandra.

685
01:30:29,233 --> 01:30:30,300
Hawkins.

686
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:32,467
Hawkins, it's me.

687
01:30:32,467 --> 01:30:33,767
It's Chandra.

688
01:30:33,767 --> 01:30:34,833
Hawkins.

689
01:30:34,833 --> 01:30:35,900
Please.

690
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:37,167
Can you feel me?

691
01:30:37,167 --> 01:30:38,300
It's me.

692
01:30:41,700 --> 01:30:42,700
Hawkins, please...

693
01:30:56,900 --> 01:30:57,933
Sebastian!

694
01:30:57,933 --> 01:30:59,633
No!
