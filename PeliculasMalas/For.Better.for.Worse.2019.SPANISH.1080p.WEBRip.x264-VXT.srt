All of us have wondered...

00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:06,022
what is love?

00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:07,763
[music starts]

4
00:01:19,514 --> 00:01:20,689
[man]
Love is...

5
00:01:21,124 --> 00:01:22,256
commitment.

6
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,214
Sharing your life.

7
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:25,563
All of it.

8
00:01:26,738 --> 00:01:28,392
Your fears and dreams.

9
00:01:30,046 --> 00:01:31,091
But...

10
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:33,658
the more you share
the more you love?

11
00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:37,097
Or the longer the relationship
the more you love?

12
00:01:38,446 --> 00:01:40,448
How do you rate
a good relationship?

13
00:01:41,362 --> 00:01:42,450
By moments?

14
00:01:42,885 --> 00:01:44,104
Which ones?

15
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:46,541
The happy ones?

16
00:01:47,498 --> 00:01:49,544
Or perhaps by enduring
the sad ones?

18
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:10,130

Hello.

22
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,400
Where did you get wine?

23
00:02:20,618 --> 00:02:21,793
Over there.

24
00:02:23,012 --> 00:02:25,275
Would you have a glass
with me... or seven?

25
00:02:26,711 --> 00:02:27,930
OK...

26
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:30,759
I'm Sebastián.

Valeria.

00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:37,331
[Sebastián] Why is it different
to fall in love

29
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:38,462
than to love somebody?

[music continues]

31
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:43,511
To fall in love is simple.

32
00:02:45,382 --> 00:02:47,079
It's about emotions...

33
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:48,951
first times...

34
00:02:52,607 --> 00:02:53,608
The first date.

35
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:01,050
The first touch.

36
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:03,270
And the first kiss.

[cell phone rings]

38
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:12,670
[Sebastián]
What if we put it all together?

39
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,716
The real and the virtual?

40
00:03:16,108 --> 00:03:16,152
THREE YEARS AGO
YOU STARTED DATING SEBASTIAÁN

41
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,285
[Sebastián] If we put together
the laughter...

42
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:19,503
the kisses...

43
00:03:19,982 --> 00:03:21,549
All the pictures we took.

44
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:24,813
The ones we shared
and those that are private.

45
00:03:25,988 --> 00:03:27,903
And what about
the late-night conversations?

46
00:03:28,382 --> 00:03:31,385
The messages,
the comments, the posts...

47
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:34,649
If we put together
all we shared...

48
00:03:35,258 --> 00:03:36,346
The movies, the songs...

49
00:03:36,477 --> 00:03:37,695
I LOVE YOU, PANDA

50
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:39,175
More moments...

51
00:03:40,176 --> 00:03:41,482
equals a better relationship?

52
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,832
The more information
we create...

53
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:45,660
the more we love each other?

54
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:47,357
Perhaps.

55
00:03:48,576 --> 00:03:49,838
But in the real
or the virtual world...

56
00:03:50,317 --> 00:03:52,362
An action, a word...

57
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:54,234

I got it when I met Valeria.

61
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:03,068
I had to go back to my mom's

62
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,201
after going all in
and losing everything.

63
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:08,204
And yes, there were hard times,

64
00:04:08,552 --> 00:04:10,119
but we faced them together.

65
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:12,600
And we would move forward
just the same.

Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

-Thanks.

You knew I had to work.
I was up all night!

93
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:32,130
Will you forgive me
or we're going in like this?

94
00:06:32,261 --> 00:06:33,871
You promised we'd be on time.

95
00:06:34,002 --> 00:06:35,612
We didn't even make it
to the service.

I'm a maid of honor.

00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:39,181
Well, that may be not so bad.

98
00:06:39,703 --> 00:06:41,836
Standing up and sitting back
down 50 times is absurd.

00:06:41,966 --> 00:06:43,011
I mean...

100
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,491
Really?

101
00:06:46,797 --> 00:06:47,885
Hello. Your name, please?

Will you forgive me already?

104
00:06:53,543 --> 00:06:54,936
We missed the service, so what?

00:06:55,197 --> 00:06:56,198
What do you mean?

106
00:06:57,373 --> 00:06:58,243
You know Ale is one
of my best friends

107
00:06:59,419 --> 00:06:59,941
and I missed her walking
down the aisle.

108
00:07:01,508 --> 00:07:02,683
Yeah, Ale, Dani, Majo and Sofi
all are your best friends

109
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:04,989
and all want to get married.
What's with that?

110
00:07:05,207 --> 00:07:06,251
But that's not the point.

111
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:09,037
The point is: you should forgive
me so we can enjoy the wedding.

112
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:11,300
It's not my fault
that you don't have friends.

113
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,175
You'll pay for this.

114
00:07:17,393 --> 00:07:19,395
Wasn't the release in a month?

115
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:20,788
Yes, but we had to work on...

116
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:22,093

I am...

124
00:07:41,156 --> 00:07:42,505
going after my dreams now.

00:07:43,114 --> 00:07:44,115
I finally became...

126
00:07:44,768 --> 00:07:46,422
the caretaker
of a whole building.

127
00:07:47,075 --> 00:07:50,078
Is that part time while you go
after your dreams or...?

128
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,166
Full time.

129
00:07:52,428 --> 00:07:54,299
In fact, I started as
a janitor and now...

130
00:07:54,996 --> 00:07:56,258
I'm in charge.

of the digital transition.

00:08:10,838 --> 00:08:12,492
It was very similar
to Spotify, right?

00:08:12,622 --> 00:08:13,971
The wedding is awesome, right?

139
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,148
Ale and I would always
dream of a wedding like this.

-Besides, Roy is a great guy.
-[woman] I know, right?

141
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:22,502
Ale must be really nervous.

142
00:08:23,198 --> 00:08:24,286
Why nervous?

143
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:26,636
I mean, if they always dreamed
of this wedding

144
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:29,465
and Troy is a great guy...

145
00:08:30,118 --> 00:08:31,772
-Roy.
-Roy is a great guy.

146
00:08:32,424 --> 00:08:35,297
Yes, but this will be
her first time.

147
00:08:36,124 --> 00:08:38,518
The first time she gets married?

148
00:08:38,822 --> 00:08:41,042
No, honey.
Ale is a virgin.

In a school play?

00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:45,742
No, I mean it.

152
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,573
God... I get it.

153
00:08:51,356 --> 00:08:52,706
Nothing at all?

154
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:55,839
She saved herself
for this special time.

155
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:58,059
She "saved herself."

156
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:01,366
So, not even...

00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:03,412
Hey, Sebas is a bit
out of line, isn't he?

158
00:09:03,934 --> 00:09:05,545
Your husband is charming!

159
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:06,894
-We're not married.
-We're just dating.

160
00:09:07,285 --> 00:09:08,330
[Sebastián]
So, hold on...

161
00:09:09,026 --> 00:09:10,158
Back on that...

162
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:14,162
What if they don't like it?
Right? It's like...

163
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:17,818
buying a very expensive car
without test-driving it.

00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:19,950
-That's for idiots.
-I was a virgin, too...

165

and I'm no idiot.

166
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:23,345
No, that's not it, girl.

167
00:09:23,475 --> 00:09:25,521
Sebastián didn't mean that.

168
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:27,175
-Right?
-No, not at all.

169
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:28,698
You are...

170
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,700
totally different.

171
00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:32,659
-You are doing really well.
-Yes.

172
00:09:33,007 --> 00:09:34,138
I need to go to the toilet.

-Do you need water?
-No, I'm fine.

00:09:56,857 --> 00:09:57,858
Twenty-seven.

181
00:09:59,424 --> 00:10:00,817
Since Ale has so many friends,
I resolved to number them.

182
00:10:01,862 --> 00:10:03,690
Nice.
And who are you?

183
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:05,430
I am the groom.

184

185
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:08,433
At the wedding.

186
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:09,957
Damn, you're right!

187
00:10:10,218 --> 00:10:11,262
Congratulations.

188
00:10:12,873 --> 00:10:14,309
-Do you want some?
-No, I'm fine.

189
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:15,658
-Just a hit.
-No, really...

You're getting married.

Ale is two months pregnant.

-We must always be together.
-Yes.

Guys, I mean, this is my moment!

209

Attending weddings is weird.
It's like... going to the past.

Not everybody is afraid
of commitment.

00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:28,035

A wedding party, a service,

215
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:29,863
200 guests
and a drunk bride, no.

216
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:32,387
Not even with the love
of your life?

217

Look at that, honey.
It's embarrassing.

Huh?

301
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:20,240
The problem was your phone.

302
00:16:21,806 --> 00:16:23,243
When you downloaded the app,
did you allow data sharing?

303
00:16:23,808 --> 00:16:26,115
No way, that makes
me very nervous.

What if someone accesses
my phone and hacks it!

305

Nobody wants to, Mike.

306
00:16:32,556 --> 00:16:34,689
That is necessary so the app

307
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:36,125
can use your mobile
Internet connection.

308
00:16:36,473 --> 00:16:38,867
So, in that case,

309
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,870

00:19:28,993 --> 00:19:29,994
Huh?

365
00:19:30,386 --> 00:19:31,518
Sorry, no.

366
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,619
Weren't you on pills?

367
00:19:46,707 --> 00:19:48,883
Yes, but I forgot to take it
on the wedding day

368
00:19:49,013 --> 00:19:50,885
and the next day,
I was hungover and I did, too.

369
00:19:51,494 --> 00:19:53,148
And the day after, I took three.

370
00:19:53,888 --> 00:19:55,106
But...

371
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,021
it was useless.

372
00:19:57,979 --> 00:19:59,067
Useless.

373
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:03,202
What if it's a phantom
pregnancy?

374
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:04,638
They are real. They are.

375
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:11,906
It's a fact.

376
00:20:18,086 --> 00:20:19,218
We'll sort it out.

377
00:20:20,915 --> 00:20:21,916
Don't worry.

378
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,918
Everything will be OK.

379
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:28,009
You...

380
00:20:29,967 --> 00:20:31,317
want to have it, right?

381
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,364
Yes.

382
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:38,367
[sighs]

383
00:20:38,498 --> 00:20:40,064
Well, it's not like
I planned it,

384
00:20:40,195 --> 00:20:41,414
I'm scared to death...

385
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:44,068
but I think it's different

386
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:45,766
to get pregnant
at 15 than at 28.

387
00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:49,857
Look, I also know...

388
00:20:51,554 --> 00:20:53,861
this isn't the best timing
for us...

389
00:20:56,037 --> 00:20:57,125
but I do want to have it.

390
00:21:03,523 --> 00:21:04,698
What about your career?

391
00:21:05,873 --> 00:21:07,048
Which one?

392
00:21:07,396 --> 00:21:09,137
Being a restaurant hostess?

393
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,443
Being a photographer!

394
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,707
It's not a terminal illness,
it's a baby!

395
00:21:15,448 --> 00:21:18,799
[music]

396
00:21:23,717 --> 00:21:24,718
[clears throat]

397
00:21:27,155 --> 00:21:28,417
We're having a kid.

398
00:21:31,246 --> 00:21:32,508
Like mature adults.

399
00:21:34,162 --> 00:21:35,381
Are we?

400
00:21:35,772 --> 00:21:36,817
Sometimes.

401
00:21:48,263 --> 00:21:49,438
Two green juices.

402
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:50,657
No prickly pear for me.

403
00:21:52,093 --> 00:21:53,224
-Sure, and for you?
-The same, but without sugar.

404
00:21:57,098 --> 00:21:58,404
-All right.
-Hi, Mom.

405
00:21:58,534 --> 00:22:00,971
-How far along is she?
-How do you know?

406
00:22:01,232 --> 00:22:02,799
[laughs]

407
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,454
Don't be silly, I'm your mother.

408
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:07,326
How far along?

409
00:22:08,109 --> 00:22:10,590
One month and a few days.

410
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,288
Oh! Oh, how exciting!

411
00:22:14,158 --> 00:22:15,812
I'm finally going to be
a grandmother.

412
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:17,945
I don't know what to do.

413
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,687
I'm really scared.

414
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,994
Well, you'll do what is right.

415
00:22:24,952 --> 00:22:26,345
I didn't raise a jerk.

416
00:22:28,303 --> 00:22:29,696
Hi, how are you?

417
00:22:29,826 --> 00:22:31,959
Hi, Juan.
The usual, please.

418
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:33,047
Right away, ma'am.

419
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:34,440
I...

420
00:22:36,746 --> 00:22:38,182
I'm happy!

421
00:22:39,967 --> 00:22:41,142
Smile!

422
00:22:48,236 --> 00:22:50,238
[baby crying]

423
00:22:55,461 --> 00:22:56,462
[sighs]

424
00:22:59,508 --> 00:23:01,902
Honestly, I'm scared to death.

425
00:23:02,337 --> 00:23:03,817
But I do want to have it.

426
00:23:05,732 --> 00:23:08,474
Well, it's not a big deal.
It's like having a Tamagotchi.

427
00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:11,868
I mean, you say your boyfriend
is doing well, right?

428
00:23:11,999 --> 00:23:13,043
Yeah.

429
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:17,004
Valeria, the truth is,
we're nearly adultescents.

430
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,875
Besides, remember they say

431
00:23:19,006 --> 00:23:21,661
a child is born under
a lucky star.

432
00:23:21,835 --> 00:23:24,403
-Yes, you're right in that.
-Yes.

433
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:26,361
Look, just relax

434
00:23:26,492 --> 00:23:28,276
and let it flow.
Everything will be alright.

435
00:23:28,494 --> 00:23:29,495
Thanks.

436
00:23:34,021 --> 00:23:35,109
Panda!

437
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:37,938
-It's really late!
-It is!

438
00:23:38,068 --> 00:23:39,374
-Give me a minute!
-Hurry up!

439
00:23:39,505 --> 00:23:40,767
-I'll be right back!
-I'll wait here.

440
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:49,515
Hi, the bar is about to close.
Can I offer you a drink?

441
00:23:49,689 --> 00:23:52,082
No, thanks.
I'm just waiting for Valeria.

442
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,697
-Sebastián.
-Yes.

443
00:23:57,871 --> 00:23:59,046
Damn it, man!

444
00:23:59,394 --> 00:24:01,614
Do you remember me?
Long time no see, man!

445
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:03,267
Alberto!

446
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,443
From high school!

447
00:24:05,052 --> 00:24:06,140
The Sevilla, man!

448
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:08,055
-Alberto...
-Can I sit down?

449
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,535
You already did.

450
00:24:10,927 --> 00:24:13,800
Damn! You still have
that black humor.

451
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:17,064
So, what have you been up to?

452
00:24:17,281 --> 00:24:19,414
Are you still
in that posh rock band?

453
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:23,244
I'm not posh
and I quit the band.

454
00:24:23,723 --> 00:24:24,811
Denial.

455
00:24:25,246 --> 00:24:28,162
Honestly, the songs were
too corny for me.

456
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:32,427
But you always defended
your style, that was cool.

457
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:34,473
Yes, actually, we did.
And what about you?

458
00:24:34,603 --> 00:24:36,126
Do you still jump
anything that moves?

459
00:24:38,868 --> 00:24:42,219
Hey, not so loud,
people will think I'm a stalker

460
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,918
and I'll get hash-tagged
and everything.

461
00:24:45,614 --> 00:24:47,007
Look, I know...

462
00:24:47,137 --> 00:24:49,488
I know I was a mess
in high school,

463
00:24:49,618 --> 00:24:51,446
but I've changed.

464
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:53,753
I'm really glad for you,
Alberto.

465
00:24:53,883 --> 00:24:55,363
It was nice to see you.

466
00:24:55,711 --> 00:24:58,584
Since I met Jesús
and I let him into my life...

467
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:00,586
the truth is, it changed.

468
00:25:01,021 --> 00:25:03,458
I became a more
enlightened being.

469
00:25:04,415 --> 00:25:05,460
OK...

470
00:25:06,026 --> 00:25:07,244
You want to meet Jesús,
don't you?

471
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:08,332
No, I'm fine.

472
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:10,770
He always wants to meet people.
Certainly.

473
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,032
-I really don't...
-Jesús!

474
00:25:12,162 --> 00:25:13,555
I'm more of an atheist...

475
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,951
[Sebastián laughs]

476
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,781
Jesús, this is Sebastián,
my high school best friend.

477
00:25:21,911 --> 00:25:23,043
Sebastián, this is Jesús.

478
00:25:23,173 --> 00:25:24,610
-No way, is this Jesús?
-Yes.

479
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,741
-Sebas!
-What's up, Chuy?

480
00:25:26,263 --> 00:25:27,787
-Hi.
-We were never best friends.

481
00:25:28,178 --> 00:25:30,572
-He's just joking.
-You know my Betito.

482
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,923
Are you... a couple?

483
00:25:34,097 --> 00:25:36,273
-Yes, since...
-Last month?

484
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,841
The inventory night
when you got here.

485
00:25:39,015 --> 00:25:41,452
-Of course.
-Stop it, Beto!

486
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:43,716
I'm glad you assumed it.

487
00:25:43,846 --> 00:25:44,847
Assumed what?

488
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:46,545
That you're gay.

489
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:48,459
-Who is?
-You.

490
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,550
I'm not gay, man.

491
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,465
-What?
-[Jesús] I'll explain it, OK?

492
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:57,033
I'm gay.
He isn't.

493
00:25:57,164 --> 00:25:59,122
And it's OK,
I don't need a label.

494
00:25:59,253 --> 00:26:01,690
No, hold on. You don't have
to explain yourself.

495
00:26:01,821 --> 00:26:03,039
-Beto, honey...
-It's very clear.

496
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,433
Yes, we have, because there are
many close-minded people

497
00:26:06,521 --> 00:26:07,043
like him and we have
to explain them.

498
00:26:08,088 --> 00:26:09,611
-That's impossible, man.
-I mean...

499
00:26:10,525 --> 00:26:13,920
So, you're saying
that because I'm gay,

500
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,835
I can't have a heterosexual
boyfriend?

501
00:26:16,052 --> 00:26:18,664
I mean, apples to apples
and oranges to oranges.

502
00:26:18,925 --> 00:26:20,796
None should mix, right?
You know what?

503
00:26:20,927 --> 00:26:22,145
I didn't know you were
like this.

504
00:26:22,276 --> 00:26:24,452
You're... a super Nazi.

505
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:28,021
You're a couple, right?

506
00:26:28,151 --> 00:26:29,588
-Yes.
-Yes, that's what we said.

507
00:26:30,066 --> 00:26:31,067
And you fuck.

508
00:26:31,198 --> 00:26:33,026
Hold on, I won't answer that.

509
00:26:33,156 --> 00:26:35,115
It's a very tacky question.

510
00:26:35,942 --> 00:26:37,508
Of course we fuck, man!

511
00:26:37,857 --> 00:26:39,989
OK?
I'm a man, I need to fuck.

512
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,775
Exactly, you're a man,
but it turns out you're gay.

513
00:26:42,905 --> 00:26:45,604
I'm not gay, man!
I don't like they put inside...

514
00:26:45,734 --> 00:26:46,692
Beto, hold on!

515
00:26:47,997 --> 00:26:49,738
You may not like anything
inside you, but...

516
00:26:50,478 --> 00:26:51,958
you like touching another man.

517
00:26:52,088 --> 00:26:54,569
Beto, it's OK.
I'll explain to him.

518
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,223
I'll ask you something, OK?

519
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,485
Do you jack off?

520
00:26:58,704 --> 00:26:59,356
Yes, what does that
have to do with...?

521
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:00,793
[Jesús]
You're gay. Period.

522
00:27:01,707 --> 00:27:02,272
You like to touch another man.

523
00:27:03,447 --> 00:27:03,839
-He's gay, don't get mad.
-Yes, he is.

524
00:27:05,014 --> 00:27:06,755
-But it's me...
-It's the same, you are.

525
00:27:07,016 --> 00:27:09,018
-Honey...
-I'm glad you two met.

526
00:27:09,149 --> 00:27:10,933
He's Jesús' boyfriend.
I've told you about him.

527
00:27:11,064 --> 00:27:12,718
Van, they went
to high school together.

528
00:27:12,848 --> 00:27:14,720
Can you believe it?
It's like destiny.

529
00:27:15,024 --> 00:27:16,722
-Really? How crazy!
-Yes.

530
00:27:16,852 --> 00:27:17,984
Destiny.

531
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:19,725
-See you.
-Bye, Chuy.

532
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:21,161
-Bye, Sebas.
-Bye, Alberto.

533
00:27:21,291 --> 00:27:22,249
-Nice to see you.
-Bye!

534
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:23,337
-Take care.
-Bye!

535
00:27:24,904 --> 00:27:26,601
I'm really glad Jesús is finally
with someone well-balanced

536
00:27:26,732 --> 00:27:28,168
who takes care of him
and loves him.

537
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:29,909
Yes, very well-balanced.

538
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:31,780
-We're really late, hurry up.
-Let's go.

539
00:27:32,215 --> 00:27:34,522
"I promised him," she told me.

540
00:27:35,871 --> 00:27:37,525
But she doesn't want
to have children.

541
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:39,875
Or to choose any sperm

542
00:27:40,006 --> 00:27:42,138
or that nobody gets inside her
for 9 months.

543
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,664
Can you hear me, darling?

544
00:27:47,578 --> 00:27:49,668
I don't want love
to be marriage,

in the sofa.

548
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:03,682

[Valeria] You snored
all the play, Sebastián!

"Play"?
That is a joke to theatre!

-I loved it.
-Yeah, right,

554
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:30,796
because she's your super
conceptual and artsy friend.

555
00:28:30,926 --> 00:28:32,319
I won't move in three hours.

556
00:28:33,102 --> 00:28:35,583
Hey! I invited her
to your birthday party.

557

-Behave!
-Alright,

558
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:39,195

00:29:08,877 --> 00:29:09,965
Do I have a booger?

562
00:29:10,096 --> 00:29:11,488
No, you don't.

563
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:12,794
So?

Vale...

-Why are you acting so weird?
-No, I'm not.

on this subject...

568
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:29,942
I mean,
in this situation that...

I think the best for both
would be...

570
00:29:37,688 --> 00:29:39,865
I mean, what we should...
Well, yes...

571
00:29:40,387 --> 00:29:43,390
Well... We should get married.

572
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:47,481
-What?
-We should get married.

00:29:50,876 --> 00:29:52,703
Are you proposing to me?

Yes.
Sort of.

-No, no. I am.

be my wife?

I swear I'll get you a real one
when I have money.

You know
I don't care about that.

Is that a yes?

00:30:15,726 --> 00:30:16,771
Are you asking me...

583
00:30:18,077 --> 00:30:19,078
because of the baby or...

584
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:21,167
because you love me?

585
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:23,822
-Because of our kid, obviously.
-Sebastián!

00:36:57,476 --> 00:36:58,520
Who hired you?

718
00:36:58,825 --> 00:37:00,218
[Jesús laughs]

719
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:04,396
Your dad didn't tell you,
did he?

720
00:37:05,745 --> 00:37:08,878
[Valeria] How dare you
hire her, Dad?

721
00:37:09,662 --> 00:37:10,967
It's my wedding!

722
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:13,970
It's not the money,
don't you get it?

723
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:17,583
I won't have a church wedding!

724
00:37:19,193 --> 00:37:22,065
And I won't go to hell,
because it doesn't exist!

725
00:37:23,023 --> 00:37:25,547
Moreover, you hired
a bipolar Art Attack girl.

726
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,550
I don't care!
Stay out of my life!

727
00:37:30,857 --> 00:37:32,685
-I was leaving, don't worry.
-I'm so sorry.

728
00:37:32,815 --> 00:37:33,947
My dad drives me crazy.

729
00:37:34,077 --> 00:37:35,470
It's OK.
I know very well

730
00:37:35,601 --> 00:37:36,776
how it works. Don't worry.

731
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:38,430
I do.

732
00:37:38,778 --> 00:37:39,822
It's just that...

733
00:37:42,434 --> 00:37:44,218
since I broke up
with my boyfriend...

734
00:37:45,611 --> 00:37:49,049
I try to move forward
one way or another...

735
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:52,879
and nothing works.

736
00:37:54,924 --> 00:37:56,143
But it's OK.

737
00:37:56,752 --> 00:37:59,494
Congratulations,
I hope your wedding is amazing.

738
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:01,757
Real pretty, real cute
and real nice...

739
00:38:02,715 --> 00:38:05,587
and that your relationship
works better than mine.

740
00:38:06,893 --> 00:38:08,286
Carolina, hold on.

741
00:38:08,764 --> 00:38:10,636
[music]

742
00:38:11,941 --> 00:38:13,073
I felt sorry for her.

743
00:38:13,247 --> 00:38:14,466
She's really depressed,

744
00:38:14,596 --> 00:38:15,989
she just broke up
with her boyfriend.

745
00:38:16,206 --> 00:38:17,686
She's not bad, she's...

746
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:19,122
kind of bipolar.

747
00:38:20,515 --> 00:38:22,387
Great, now we have
a depressive and psycho planner.

748
00:38:22,691 --> 00:38:24,258
We wanted a small wedding,
didn't we?

749
00:38:24,737 --> 00:38:26,347
You want a small wedding.

750
00:38:26,478 --> 00:38:27,783
I always wanted
something bigger,

751
00:38:27,914 --> 00:38:29,089
but I made up my mind for us.

752
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:30,220
Let it go.

753
00:38:32,397 --> 00:38:33,528
Bigger.

754
00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:36,444
The shrimp one is delicious.

755
00:38:36,575 --> 00:38:38,316
Yes, shrimp is really good.

756
00:38:38,446 --> 00:38:40,448
Full of cholesterol,
bad for babies...

757
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:41,623
OK, fine.

758
00:38:45,018 --> 00:38:46,498
[moans of enjoyment]

759
00:38:47,281 --> 00:38:48,326
This is my favorite.

760
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,371
-No, I don't think so.
-Why not?

761
00:38:50,502 --> 00:38:52,068
I'm just saying,
it's full of salt

762
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:53,635
and it causes swelling.
You're very swollen,

763
00:38:53,766 --> 00:38:55,768
maybe you want a blowfish look.

764
00:38:55,898 --> 00:38:56,899
Enough.

765
00:38:59,424 --> 00:39:00,425
Write this down.

766
00:39:01,469 --> 00:39:02,644
And the Serrano ham one, too.

767
00:39:02,862 --> 00:39:04,167
If I get swollen,
it's my problem.

768
00:39:04,298 --> 00:39:05,734
And if you don't fit
in the dress, too.

769
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:10,348
I'll write that down.

770
00:39:14,569 --> 00:39:15,570
What...

771
00:39:16,266 --> 00:39:18,356
What I don't get is...

772
00:39:20,096 --> 00:39:23,796
how can you submit a newborn
to that savageness.

773
00:39:23,926 --> 00:39:27,452
That is called circumcision.

774
00:39:27,756 --> 00:39:30,411
And what is cut is the prepuce.

775
00:39:30,672 --> 00:39:34,241
Nobody likes a man
with the skin hanging...

776
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:36,330
-Who wants dessert?
-I'll go with you.

777
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:37,505
-Sir?
-No.

778
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,420
-Thank you.
-And you, Mom?

779
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:40,508
Yes.

780
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,554
[Sebastián]
A big success, right?

781
00:39:43,729 --> 00:39:44,512
Their eyes will get
their eyes out.

782
00:39:45,687 --> 00:39:46,558
[Valeria]
I don't know where to start.

783
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,776
All of them look delicious.

784
00:39:47,907 --> 00:39:49,517
Let's see... chocolate.

785
00:39:57,569 --> 00:39:58,787
It's Nutella's,
it's really good.

786
00:40:00,223 --> 00:40:01,311
Don't you dare.

787
00:40:01,529 --> 00:40:03,009
I swear I wasn't going
to say anything.

788
00:40:03,488 --> 00:40:05,141
Hey, do you know
what we have skipped?

789
00:40:05,315 --> 00:40:07,622
Your bachelorette party!

790
00:40:07,753 --> 00:40:10,277
I need you to make a list
with all your guests,

791
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,452
but more importantly,

792
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:13,411
that you start
to choose the toys.

793
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:15,630
-No, Carolina.
-Why not?

794
00:40:15,761 --> 00:40:17,153
Not here, there's people around.

795
00:40:17,937 --> 00:40:19,982
Besides, I've never liked
those parties.

796
00:40:20,113 --> 00:40:21,375
Honestly, I think I'll pass.

797
00:40:21,506 --> 00:40:23,421
No, no, no.
What are you talking about?

798
00:40:23,551 --> 00:40:25,945
Moreover, my friends are prudes.
I don't think...

799
00:40:26,075 --> 00:40:28,295
Val, this is your last day
of fun.

800
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,429
It's madness,
it's the day you surrender,

801
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:35,694
let all your desires out
and give up to marriage.

802
00:40:36,651 --> 00:40:37,783
Maybe.

803
00:40:38,044 --> 00:40:40,002
Maybe they'll have a lot of fun.

804
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:43,702
Obviously!
Just leave it all to me.

805
00:40:43,832 --> 00:40:46,748
I'll arrange it, and remember
one thing Valeria.

806
00:40:46,879 --> 00:40:49,925
My wedding service is integral.

807
00:40:52,406 --> 00:40:53,494
Hey.

808
00:40:54,756 --> 00:40:55,888
Who is Pamela Asencio

809
00:40:56,018 --> 00:40:57,933
and why does she like
all your posts?

810
00:40:58,978 --> 00:41:00,240
She's Mike's daughter.

811
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,634
She's working at the office.

812
00:41:02,808 --> 00:41:03,809
I see.

813
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:05,811
Do you like her?

814
00:41:05,941 --> 00:41:07,465
No way!

815
00:41:08,553 --> 00:41:11,381
No! Besides, she's almost
a minor. She's a little girl.

816
00:41:12,426 --> 00:41:14,515
-Well, she likes you.
-I don't think so.

817
00:41:14,646 --> 00:41:16,343
-It's your imagination.
-Sebastián.

818
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:18,824
Why would she like
everything you post, then?

819
00:41:18,954 --> 00:41:21,522
I don't know, that's the way
kids connect nowadays.

820
00:41:21,653 --> 00:41:24,133
What can I say? I don't get
it either. Things are like that.

821
00:41:24,264 --> 00:41:27,223
By the way, Carolina is planning
a bachelorette party

822
00:41:27,354 --> 00:41:28,529
with all my friends.

823
00:41:30,052 --> 00:41:31,837
Have you thought about yours?

824
00:41:32,011 --> 00:41:35,667
No, those are old-fashioned...

825
00:41:35,797 --> 00:41:37,407
boring, unnecessary,
expensive...

826
00:41:37,538 --> 00:41:38,713
Stop it. It's up to you.

827
00:41:40,585 --> 00:41:41,586
Hey...

828
00:41:42,848 --> 00:41:44,893
Mike's birthday is on Friday.
Shall we go?

829
00:41:45,677 --> 00:41:46,808
-Sorry.
-Will I go alone again?

830
00:41:46,939 --> 00:41:47,896
-Come on.
-No, I can't.

831
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:50,464
My bachelorette party is on
Friday and you can't be there.

832
00:41:50,595 --> 00:41:51,944
There will be only girls
and Jesús.

833
00:41:52,074 --> 00:41:53,075
Obviously.

834
00:41:55,338 --> 00:41:57,471
You can't get...

835
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,827
-Mike!
-You made it, Sebas!

836
00:42:06,001 --> 00:42:07,307
It's nice to see you!

837
00:42:08,308 --> 00:42:11,050
-I wouldn't miss your birthday.
-Thanks, son.

838
00:42:11,441 --> 00:42:12,530
Don't.

839
00:42:14,053 --> 00:42:17,099
This is Sebastián, darling.

840
00:42:17,796 --> 00:42:19,362
Hi, nice to meet you.

841
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:20,799
Hi.

842
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,804
Have a drink with me, would you?

843
00:42:26,021 --> 00:42:27,066
Sure.

844
00:42:33,202 --> 00:42:34,203
Cheers.

845
00:42:35,944 --> 00:42:36,989
Cheers.

00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:49,175
-Put that cigar down, darling.
-Oh, come on!

00:42:49,305 --> 00:42:50,306
He will be OK.

848
00:42:50,437 --> 00:42:52,526
-Who?
-The baby.

849
00:42:52,961 --> 00:42:54,267
I'm two months.

850
00:42:56,008 --> 00:42:57,618
-Pregnant?
-Yes.

851
00:42:57,923 --> 00:43:01,753
Well, we have to greet
The Trujillos that just arrived.

852
00:43:01,883 --> 00:43:03,581
-Go, go.
-Not The Trujillos.

853
00:43:03,885 --> 00:43:05,800
-Enjoy the party.
-Congratulations.

854
00:43:05,931 --> 00:43:08,020
-No, I don't want to.
-Yes, of course you do.

855
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:10,370
-Help me, Santiago, please!
-Come on.

856
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,806
Enjoy the party, Sebastián!

857
00:43:11,937 --> 00:43:14,069
Santiago?
What's wrong? It's Sebastián.

858
00:43:15,288 --> 00:43:17,943
Carolina, don't! It's ross!

859
00:43:18,247 --> 00:43:20,902
Look how cute!
It has eyes!

860
00:43:21,033 --> 00:43:23,035
Really? Nobody uses this.

861
00:43:24,036 --> 00:43:25,951
This is just like Eric's, girl.

862
00:43:26,212 --> 00:43:30,303
Hey, the toys are great and all,
but when is stripper time?

863

[music]

864
00:43:50,932 --> 00:43:52,630
No, no.
Stay away, asshole.

865
00:43:54,109 --> 00:43:56,024
-I said stay away!
-Look who's here.

866
00:43:57,547 --> 00:43:59,245
I'm sorry, I thought...

867
00:44:00,986 --> 00:44:02,857
-Hello.
-Hi.

868
00:44:04,293 --> 00:44:05,294
How are you?

869
00:44:06,905 --> 00:44:08,341
This is like a funeral.

870
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:11,605
It is.

871
00:44:14,173 --> 00:44:15,478
Would you go with me to smoke?

872
00:44:16,828 --> 00:44:18,743
This is a garden,
I think you can do it here.

873
00:44:18,873 --> 00:44:21,310
I know, but my Dad doesn't like
that I smoke.

874
00:44:21,876 --> 00:44:22,964
Come with me.

875
00:44:23,095 --> 00:44:24,531
I think I'll wait here.

876
00:44:25,053 --> 00:44:26,098
Dude!

877
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:30,885
You've got to see
my father's guitar collection.

878
00:44:32,365 --> 00:44:33,453
Now?

879
00:44:35,107 --> 00:44:36,543
Relax the sacrum.

880
00:44:38,153 --> 00:44:42,027
I feel how my iliac crests
expand lightly.

881
00:44:42,462 --> 00:44:44,638
I let it reach my anus.

882
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,863
-No, Pamela.
-Hey, hold on.

883
00:44:52,864 --> 00:44:54,430
No way!

884
00:44:57,390 --> 00:44:58,391
Wow!

885
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,568
I told you.

886
00:45:01,742 --> 00:45:04,789
I see a spear through me
from the perineum

887
00:45:05,093 --> 00:45:06,486
to the crown.

888
00:45:08,575 --> 00:45:11,578
-And for a moment...
-Valeria, are you OK?

889
00:45:11,883 --> 00:45:13,145
I forget about my history.

890
00:45:13,275 --> 00:45:15,016
Yes, I feel a little low.

891
00:45:15,147 --> 00:45:17,540
Why don't you go and grab
a bite, then you throw up.

892
00:45:17,671 --> 00:45:19,064
-I always do it.
-Hey!

893

If she doesn't,
she won't fit in the dress.

I feel better now.

00:45:29,378 --> 00:45:32,512
-Why are they on the floor?
-I don't know, he likes it.

Don't.

-Somebody could come in.
-Nobody will.

-Your father will.
-It's locked, OK?

-Hey, relax.
-Don't.

No, I'm not relaxed at all.

-You don't like me?
-No, that's not it.

This could be
your bachelor party, then.

Yes, but it isn't.

Have you ever had it underwater?

What?

Besides, she's Mike's daughter.
She had to be there.

Wasn't she a little girl?

I didn't have sex with her.
Of course not.

You aren't going crazy.

I wasn't expecting this.

993

Hey, Carolina found a garden
for the wedding.

It's amazing and really cheap.

must be done today.

998
00:54:25,131 --> 00:54:27,002
Well, I was thinking that
since there's no rush anymore...

999
00:54:27,133 --> 00:54:28,961
I don't know, we could...

1000
00:54:29,831 --> 00:54:31,311
-Postpone it.
-Call it off.

1001
00:54:31,746 --> 00:54:32,791
What?

1002
00:54:32,921 --> 00:54:34,662
No, no.
I meant postpone it.

1003
00:54:37,186 --> 00:54:38,797
You don't want to marry me.

1004
00:54:39,232 --> 00:54:41,626
No, not at all.
I meant to postpone it.

1005
00:54:41,843 --> 00:54:44,498
Because now, we have more time.

1006
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,848
Wow!

1007
00:54:48,154 --> 00:54:49,155
You would only marry me
because I was pregnant.

1008
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,157
Honey, I'm just saying

1009
00:54:51,418 --> 00:54:53,899
that we could take things
more slowly.

1010
00:54:54,073 --> 00:54:55,596
It was the only thing
I asked you, Sebastián.

1011
00:54:55,727 --> 00:54:57,119
Panda, would you listen to me?

1012
00:54:57,250 --> 00:54:58,556
I do want to marry you,

1013
00:54:58,686 --> 00:55:00,645
now, we have time to plan
a better wedding.

-Go.
-That's all.

1015
00:55:03,169 --> 00:55:05,389
-Honey...
-Could you leave me alone?

1016
00:55:07,216 --> 00:55:09,523
-Are you serious, Panda?
-Get out, Sebastián!

I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN

BETTER. IT'LL BE ALRIGHT

I don't know if you've noticed,

1045
00:57:24,484 --> 00:57:26,443
but Valeria hasn't come
in two weeks.

1046
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:29,924
So, no matter how much you wait,
she won't show up.

1047
00:57:32,492 --> 00:57:33,928
Where's everyone else?

1048
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,150
We are short on staff.

And Jesús?

1050
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,901
Don't even mention him.

1051
00:57:50,423 --> 00:57:52,773
We're not together anymore
and he doesn't work here.

1052
00:57:54,558 --> 00:57:55,776
What happened?

1053
00:57:58,562 --> 00:58:01,303
He's very gay and, honestly,
I'm more heterosexual,

1054
00:58:01,434 --> 00:58:02,957
more of an alpha male, dude.

1055
00:58:03,828 --> 00:58:04,916
Right.

1056
00:58:07,005 --> 00:58:08,136
What went wrong?

1057
00:58:09,007 --> 00:58:11,444
He made the biggest
mistake of his life.

1058
00:58:11,662 --> 00:58:13,272
Picture this, he told me...

1059
00:58:13,402 --> 00:58:14,969
that he accepted me
for who I was.

1060
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,581
I mean, I could deal with...

1061
00:58:18,016 --> 00:58:21,323
Well, that he was a bum bandit,
a Peter Puffer,

1062
00:58:21,454 --> 00:58:24,109
-a pole smoker, a queer...
-I get it, man.

1063
00:58:26,241 --> 00:58:28,722
But that he wants
to convince me that I'm gay...

1064
00:58:29,157 --> 00:58:30,332
No fucking way!

1065
00:58:32,726 --> 00:58:34,685
Don't you care
what you feel for him?

1066
00:58:34,902 --> 00:58:36,687
Yes, that fucker is dead to me.

1067
00:58:37,426 --> 00:58:38,689
And you know what?

1068
00:58:39,254 --> 00:58:43,041
I can accept anything,
Sebastián, except liars.

1070
00:58:52,485 --> 00:58:53,921
I'm not sure
this is a good idea.

1071
00:58:54,052 --> 00:58:55,880
No, no, no.
Don't give me that.

1072
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:58,099
-When did you last go out?
-Let's come back another day.

1073
00:58:58,230 --> 00:59:00,362
No!
Please, don't do this to me.

1074
00:59:01,102 --> 00:59:03,061
Why are you doing
all this for me, Caro?

1075
00:59:03,278 --> 00:59:04,323
Didn't I tell you?

1076
00:59:04,584 --> 00:59:06,064
My integral service

1077
00:59:06,194 --> 00:59:08,675
also includes psychological
and moral assistance

1078
00:59:08,806 --> 00:59:10,068
to unfortunate friends like you.

1079
00:59:11,504 --> 00:59:13,637
As long as the unfortunate
soul is you and only you.

1080
00:59:13,898 --> 00:59:15,421
Well then.

1081
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:16,944
-Shall we go?
-Yes.

1082
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:22,080
OK, go.
Shot! Shot! Shot!

1083
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:23,603
Come on.
One, two...

1084
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:29,696
[music]

1085
00:59:41,186 --> 00:59:42,491
Cheers!

1086
00:59:49,194 --> 00:59:51,544
It's a kind of cute, admit it.
Isn't it?

1087
00:59:51,675 --> 00:59:52,806
Thanks for bringing me here.

1088
00:59:53,415 --> 00:59:54,591
Sorry? Did you say "thanks"?

1089
00:59:54,721 --> 00:59:55,853
Can you say it louder?

1090
00:59:56,375 --> 00:59:57,419
Say it loud...

1091
00:59:57,985 --> 00:59:58,986
What?

1092
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,509
Why did you kick me?

1093
01:00:00,684 --> 01:00:01,728
Val?

1094
01:00:02,947 --> 01:00:05,253
Alonso, what's up?
What are you doing here?

1095
01:00:06,211 --> 01:00:08,082
I'm giving a gig in this hotel.

1096
01:00:08,822 --> 01:00:09,867
And you?

1097
01:00:10,737 --> 01:00:12,652
She's celebrating she's single.

1098
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:14,001
-We both are.
-No, no.

1099
01:00:14,132 --> 01:00:16,264
-Really?
-We're just partying.

1100
01:00:16,874 --> 01:00:20,704
Well, if you're single,
come meet my band.

1101
01:00:21,443 --> 01:00:23,010
Are they single?

1102
01:00:23,228 --> 01:00:24,446
-Yes.
-Really?

1103
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:27,058
Very single.

1104
01:00:28,668 --> 01:00:30,627
I think I'm going to say hi.
It's rude not to greet people.

1105
01:00:30,931 --> 01:00:32,280
-Bye.
-No.

1106
01:00:32,411 --> 01:00:33,847
-Martín.
-You go, girl.

1107
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:46,860
I was just thinking
of you yesterday.

1108
01:00:47,078 --> 01:00:48,296
And what were you thinking of?

1109
01:00:48,732 --> 01:00:50,951
Of all the times
you cheated on me?

1110
01:01:05,357 --> 01:01:06,401
Hi.

1111
01:01:07,054 --> 01:01:08,055
Hey.

1112
01:01:09,361 --> 01:01:11,668
Why are you still here?
It's midnight.

1113
01:01:12,407 --> 01:01:13,408
Yes...

1114
01:01:14,627 --> 01:01:16,977
but we haven't talked
in about a month.

1115
01:01:18,849 --> 01:01:20,372
We talk every day, Pam.

1116
01:01:20,502 --> 01:01:22,113
Yes, but about boring stuff.

1117
01:01:22,243 --> 01:01:24,245
I don't know, about work.

1118
01:01:25,551 --> 01:01:26,944
Can't we talk about...

1119
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:28,989
me, perhaps?

1120
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:33,211
OK.

1121
01:01:33,515 --> 01:01:35,561
The same happened to me.

1122
01:01:36,823 --> 01:01:39,521
She stood me up two weeks
before the wedding.

1123
01:01:39,783 --> 01:01:41,088
All was set.

1124
01:01:42,437 --> 01:01:43,438
That's terrible.

1125
01:01:45,136 --> 01:01:46,354
But it worked for me.

1126
01:01:47,355 --> 01:01:49,401
Because I turned
all that pain...

1127
01:01:50,315 --> 01:01:52,360
and I turned it into
creative energy.

1128
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,233
-God, Alonso!
-I turned into the alchemist.

1129
01:01:55,494 --> 01:01:58,062
-OK.
-It's my second album's name.

1130
01:01:58,758 --> 01:01:59,759
Wow!

1131
01:02:01,239 --> 01:02:05,025
How would you like to go
to talk to a more private place?

1132
01:02:05,939 --> 01:02:07,071
No.

1133
01:02:07,854 --> 01:02:09,464
I won't leave my friend
on her own.

1134
01:02:10,596 --> 01:02:13,381
Well... she isn't exactly
on her own.

1135
01:02:31,530 --> 01:02:33,358
We have a problem, Sebastián.

1136
01:02:35,012 --> 01:02:36,056
No...

1137
01:02:36,361 --> 01:02:37,536
Which?

1138
01:02:39,277 --> 01:02:40,582
I think I'm...

1139
01:02:42,236 --> 01:02:44,369
You're what, Pam?
You're...?

1140
01:02:44,848 --> 01:02:46,023
I think I'm...

1141
01:02:46,458 --> 01:02:48,242
in love with you, OK?

1142
01:02:52,377 --> 01:02:53,987
-Is that all?
-What?

1143
01:02:54,118 --> 01:02:55,206
Isn't that enough?

1144
01:02:55,728 --> 01:02:57,208
-I need you...
-No! What are you doing?

1145
01:02:57,469 --> 01:02:58,775
No, no, stop it.

1146
01:02:58,905 --> 01:03:00,080
-Listen to me.
-Please, stop.

1147
01:03:00,211 --> 01:03:01,865
-I need you to make love to me.
-No.

1148
01:03:01,995 --> 01:03:03,649
-I can't!
-Sebas, just a little!

1149
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:04,868
Don't tear off my shirt!

1150
01:03:04,998 --> 01:03:06,086
-Pam, please!
-Hush.

1151
01:03:12,353 --> 01:03:13,485
What?
What is it?

1152
01:03:13,615 --> 01:03:14,616
-What?
-Stop it, Pam.

1153
01:03:14,747 --> 01:03:16,705
-What?
-I love Valeria.

1154
01:03:18,533 --> 01:03:19,752
And I love you.

1155
01:03:20,753 --> 01:03:23,974
-I'm being serious.
-I'm, too, OK?

1156
01:03:24,888 --> 01:03:26,498
-Pam, get off me.
-What? Come on.

1157
01:03:26,628 --> 01:03:27,891
-Please, get off.
-What are you doing?

1158
01:03:28,021 --> 01:03:29,196
-Please, get off me.
-Come on.

1159
01:03:29,327 --> 01:03:30,632
-No, get off me.
-Come on!

1160
01:03:30,981 --> 01:03:32,025
Pam.

1161
01:03:34,158 --> 01:03:36,203
You're really a jerk!

1162
01:03:37,465 --> 01:03:39,293
I am, get dressed.

1163
01:03:40,904 --> 01:03:42,296
You know you want it.

1164
01:03:42,427 --> 01:03:44,908
-Please, get dressed.
-You don't like me? Is that it?

1165
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:49,303
No, that...
That isn't...

1166
01:03:50,348 --> 01:03:51,436
I can't.

1167
01:03:54,787 --> 01:03:55,788
I don't want to.

1168
01:03:57,964 --> 01:04:01,011
They gave me a very cool suite
because of the gig.

1169
01:04:02,273 --> 01:04:03,622
Don't you want to see it?

1170
01:04:05,798 --> 01:04:08,496
No, Alonso.
We'd better go back.

1171
01:04:13,632 --> 01:04:15,416
No, stop.
I can't do this.

1172
01:04:15,547 --> 01:04:16,853
I swear I can't.

1173
01:04:17,331 --> 01:04:19,116
Are you rejecting me?

1174
01:04:23,903 --> 01:04:25,818
Yes.
I am rejecting you.

1175
01:04:31,737 --> 01:04:33,217
What do I do now?
That's big.

1176
01:04:33,782 --> 01:04:36,307
I'd never been rejected.
How awkward.

1177
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:38,875
Pam...

1178
01:04:39,963 --> 01:04:41,051
I'm sorry.

1179
01:04:42,661 --> 01:04:45,272
But... there's always
a first time.

1180
01:04:48,536 --> 01:04:50,538
-No, I mean it.
-It's OK.

1181
01:04:51,235 --> 01:04:52,976
You don't know
who you're messing with.

1182
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,281
Yes, I know.

1183
01:04:54,499 --> 01:04:56,196
No, you don't.

1184
01:05:07,251 --> 01:05:08,905
Alonso, stop.
Stop, I...

1185
01:05:09,035 --> 01:05:10,907
-I'm going to Hell.
-No...

1186
01:05:15,259 --> 01:05:16,869
NEW MESSAGE

1187
01:05:18,566 --> 01:05:21,439
I'M SORRY, SEBI.

Fuck!

1189
01:05:29,708 --> 01:05:31,797
What the fuck!
What's wrong with you?

1190
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:32,929
You're a murderer!

1191
01:05:34,669 --> 01:05:36,019

Fucking psycho bitch!

1196
01:05:53,384 --> 01:05:54,951
I'm going to tell your dad!

1197
01:05:55,081 --> 01:05:57,954
You're not going to tell
anything to anybody, fucker.

1198
01:05:58,171 --> 01:06:01,696
Otherwise, I'll say you raped me
at my dad's party.

1199
01:06:01,827 --> 01:06:03,394
Who would they believe?

1200
01:06:03,524 --> 01:06:04,612
What?

1201
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:06,745
I told you not to mess with me.

1202
01:06:14,144 --> 01:06:15,580

INCOMING CALL

1206
01:06:46,828 --> 01:06:48,178
Help!

1207
01:06:55,881 --> 01:06:58,449
-Smile, dude!
-Wait, we're going to stumble.

1208
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:01,321
Holy crap!
You do look handsome!

1209
01:07:01,669 --> 01:07:04,107
Don't worry, man,
with all that morphine,

1210
01:07:04,368 --> 01:07:05,934
you won't feel a thing.

1211
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:10,678
You're a good friend,
Alberto.

1212
01:07:10,809 --> 01:07:13,899
-Thank you.
-You should thank the nurses.

1213
01:07:14,247 --> 01:07:15,988
You owe me a big one.

1214
01:07:19,078 --> 01:07:20,732
Yes, I owe you a big one.

1215
01:07:21,124 --> 01:07:23,213
But you're indeed
a very good friend, man.

1216
01:07:23,778 --> 01:07:25,389
We were best friends
in high school

1217
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:27,043
until you tried to rape me.

1218
01:07:28,479 --> 01:07:31,395
Come on, don't be a pussy!
You can't cut it.

1219
01:07:31,743 --> 01:07:33,440
So?
Shall I take you home?

1220
01:07:33,571 --> 01:07:34,833
No, take me to Valeria's.

1221
01:07:35,094 --> 01:07:36,965
I don't think it's wise.

1222
01:07:37,314 --> 01:07:39,229
Take me to Valeria's,
goddamn it!

1223
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,060
Fine.

1224
01:07:44,234 --> 01:07:46,323
Friend's number one rule.

1225
01:07:47,193 --> 01:07:49,282
You don't yell
at your best friend.

1226
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:50,501
I'm sorry.

1227
01:07:51,893 --> 01:07:53,504
Write something cool.

1228
01:07:53,852 --> 01:07:56,333
Best friends, rescue, Alberto.

1229
01:07:57,073 --> 01:07:58,074
And tag yourself.

1230
01:07:58,944 --> 01:08:00,554
[Sebastián]
No, not the puppy face.

1231
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:18,485
Bye, gorgeous.
I'll call you.

1232
01:08:33,370 --> 01:08:34,458
[Valeria]
Sebastián?

1233
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,896
What are you doing here?
What happened?

1234
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,116
I'm OK.

1235
01:08:45,295 --> 01:08:46,774
I wanted to talk with you.

1236
01:08:47,253 --> 01:08:49,734
-Look, I...
-Val.

1237
01:08:50,648 --> 01:08:51,779
Please, listen to me.

1238
01:08:56,219 --> 01:08:57,263
I screw up.

1239
01:09:00,962 --> 01:09:03,313
We're going through this
because of me.

1240
01:09:07,317 --> 01:09:09,971
But I need you to know
you're the love of my life.

1241
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,369
It's not that I didn't want
to marry you...

1242
01:09:18,241 --> 01:09:19,329
I'm terrified...

1243
01:09:20,243 --> 01:09:21,940
I might not to be the man
you deserve.

1244
01:09:24,334 --> 01:09:26,292
I'll probably lose
you over this...

1245
01:09:29,034 --> 01:09:30,601
but I need
to tell you something.

1246
01:09:38,435 --> 01:09:40,001
I made many mistakes.

1247
01:09:40,828 --> 01:09:43,657
Many that I can't make right.

1248
01:09:45,790 --> 01:09:47,705
But lying to you was the worst.

1249
01:09:50,055 --> 01:09:51,578
What are you talking about?

1250
01:09:55,495 --> 01:09:57,193
[sad music]

1251
01:10:04,417 --> 01:10:05,679
At Mike's party...

1252
01:10:09,727 --> 01:10:11,163
I was with Pamela.

1253
01:10:14,558 --> 01:10:15,776
Did you...?

1254
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:25,917
-You're an asshole.
-Yes.

1255
01:10:27,353 --> 01:10:28,615
I am.

1256
01:10:33,925 --> 01:10:36,188
You just got down
from Alonso's car.

1257
01:10:38,321 --> 01:10:40,018
Will you tell me
nothing happened?

1258
01:10:40,497 --> 01:10:43,935
It's not your fucking business.
We're not together anymore.

1259
01:10:44,065 --> 01:10:45,458
[music starts]

1260
01:11:06,436 --> 01:11:08,089
[music continues]

1261
01:11:44,604 --> 01:11:46,214
Fucking idiot!

1262
01:11:56,964 --> 01:11:59,097
[music ends]

1263
01:11:59,227 --> 01:12:01,969
I was thinking that
since we won't work together

1264
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:05,408
and you're single now,
we could try to...

1265
01:12:07,932 --> 01:12:11,849
Pamela, I really hope
you've enjoyed it,

1266
01:12:12,023 --> 01:12:14,895
because I don't want to see you
again in my fucking life.

1267
01:12:46,623 --> 01:12:49,582
SEBASTIAÁN
INCOMING CALL

1268
01:13:08,949 --> 01:13:10,908
[sad music]

1269
01:13:32,451 --> 01:13:33,931
EMPTY TRASH?

1270
01:13:51,035 --> 01:13:52,515
[sad music]

1271
01:13:58,869 --> 01:14:00,871
NEW MESSAGE

1272

MOMENTS

1273
01:14:05,528 --> 01:14:09,183
VALERIA, PLEASE FORGIVE ME
I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU

1274
01:14:14,232 --> 01:14:16,016
[sad music]

1275
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,718
Really, Sebastián?

1276
01:14:22,327 --> 01:14:23,328
Will you go on?

1277
01:14:23,894 --> 01:14:25,069
What else can I do?

1278
01:14:25,722 --> 01:14:26,897
I lost the love of my life.

1279
01:14:27,245 --> 01:14:28,725
Yes, sure.

1280
01:14:28,855 --> 01:14:31,728
It's perfectly OK
not to have a job, right?

1281
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:34,774
Man, listen.

1282
01:14:35,732 --> 01:14:38,561
Why don't you download
one of those Apps

1283
01:14:38,691 --> 01:14:40,127
to shake the sheets?

1284
01:14:42,042 --> 01:14:43,348
Did you say, "shake the sheets"?

1285
01:14:43,566 --> 01:14:44,654
It was too much, right?

1286
01:14:45,002 --> 01:14:47,134
I'm sorry, I visited
my mom yesterday.

1287
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:48,614
I'm not interested.

1288
01:14:50,442 --> 01:14:51,835
Well, you should be,

1289
01:14:51,965 --> 01:14:54,054
because after
the stupid act you pulled,

1290
01:14:54,185 --> 01:14:55,752
I doubt you have another chance.

1291
01:14:55,882 --> 01:14:57,275
I know, trust me.

1292
01:14:59,103 --> 01:15:00,496
But I only love her.

1293
01:15:01,671 --> 01:15:03,194
I love Valeria, my Valeria.

1294
01:15:03,324 --> 01:15:06,458
-So, stop whining and find her!
-Where?

1295
01:15:08,112 --> 01:15:12,333
She won't answer my calls
or answer my messages.

1296
01:15:12,899 --> 01:15:14,771
I may know
where she'll be tomorrow.

1297
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:17,208
What?

1298
01:15:18,557 --> 01:15:19,950
Jesús posted on Facebook
they'd go to a concert.

1299
01:15:20,211 --> 01:15:21,821
Didn't he block you on Facebook?

1300
01:15:21,952 --> 01:15:23,910
Yes, but I created
a fake profile

1301
01:15:24,041 --> 01:15:26,826
with one of his fairy
friends' picture.

1302
01:15:28,132 --> 01:15:29,176
What?

1303
01:15:30,177 --> 01:15:31,527
I miss him a lot, man.

1304
01:15:35,574 --> 01:15:37,533
-Damn, you're a genius!
-What?

1305
01:15:37,794 --> 01:15:38,838
Where are you going?

1306
01:15:38,969 --> 01:15:40,797
No way, miss.

1307
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:42,538
We're going
to this concert together.

1308
01:15:42,668 --> 01:15:43,800
I'm not in the mood, Chucho.

1309
01:15:45,453 --> 01:15:47,978
There are two options, and we
didn't want to tell you, but...

1310
01:15:48,413 --> 01:15:51,068
Either you let him go or...

1311
01:15:51,851 --> 01:15:53,200
-You call him.
-What?

1312
01:15:53,592 --> 01:15:54,637
No way!

1313
01:15:55,899 --> 01:15:57,030
God, Valeria!
Why are you so hard on him?

1314
01:15:57,291 --> 01:15:58,989
He wasn't the only one who...

1315
01:15:59,642 --> 01:16:01,992
-Right?
-I'm sorry for that.

1316
01:16:03,254 --> 01:16:04,342
I hate you.

1317
01:16:10,304 --> 01:16:12,219
[music]

1318
01:16:20,401 --> 01:16:22,708
Well, before we go on,
I've a surprise for you.

1319
01:16:22,839 --> 01:16:25,581
A very dear friend
asked me a favor.

1320
01:16:26,625 --> 01:16:30,455
He has a very important message
for the girl he loves.

1321
01:16:40,204 --> 01:16:41,597
Thanks a lot, Rodrigo.

1322
01:16:48,386 --> 01:16:50,475
Valeria, I know you're here

1323
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:52,869
and we can't undo our mistakes.

1324
01:16:55,393 --> 01:16:56,786
But I think we can...

1325
01:16:57,351 --> 01:16:59,963
begin again... always.

1326
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:24,988
Hold me

1327
01:17:26,119 --> 01:17:31,951
I don't want to see you
Disappear

1328
01:17:39,219 --> 01:17:42,919
Forgive me

1329
01:17:43,397 --> 01:17:46,618
I didn't mean to hurt you

1330
01:17:46,749 --> 01:17:50,491
That time

1331
01:17:56,715 --> 01:18:00,632
We crashed
And burned unknowingly

1332
01:18:00,937 --> 01:18:04,462
Against the break of day

1333
01:18:05,376 --> 01:18:11,382
And in a thousand pieces
On your skin I stayed

1334
01:18:14,037 --> 01:18:18,215
We uncovered ourselves

1335
01:18:18,345 --> 01:18:21,958
Until we vanished

1336
01:18:22,654 --> 01:18:28,660
Lost in the moment
I gave in

1337
01:18:34,231 --> 01:18:36,059
And when we forgot it...

1338
01:18:36,189 --> 01:18:39,453
-Hold on, they'll see you.
-I don't care, faggot.

1339
01:18:40,498 --> 01:18:46,504
We were born again

1340
01:19:15,359 --> 01:19:16,403
Panda...

1341
01:19:22,061 --> 01:19:23,367
Would you marry me?

1342
01:19:28,415 --> 01:19:30,026
["Caderas blancas" playing]

["Caderas blancas" continues]

1344
01:20:04,669 --> 01:20:06,410
Yes, I do.

1345
01:20:17,769 --> 01:20:18,814
She said yes!

1346
01:20:26,386 --> 01:20:28,127
[Valeria]
So, what is love?

1347
01:20:28,693 --> 01:20:31,696
I don't know the precise words
to answer that.

1348
01:20:32,610 --> 01:20:36,135
[Sebastián] Love is incredible,
but it's not perfect, right?

1349
01:20:36,266 --> 01:20:39,399
It's wonderful,
but oftentimes it's not easy.

1350
01:20:40,574 --> 01:20:41,793
[Valeria]
Love is everything.

1351
01:20:42,663 --> 01:20:45,057
It's indeed sharing
and commitment.

1352
01:20:45,449 --> 01:20:47,930
[Sebastián] But it's also
to recognize we aren't perfect

1353
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:49,148
and we make mistakes.

1354
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:52,978
[Valeria] To give yourself
completely and unconditionally.

1355
01:20:54,458 --> 01:20:56,634
To take a leap of faith
despite the fear.

1356
01:20:59,202 --> 01:21:02,553
[Sebastián] Love is
to face the world, together.

1357
01:21:03,554 --> 01:21:05,643
To forgive and begin again.

1358
01:21:06,644 --> 01:21:07,732
[Valeria]
For better...

1359
01:21:08,167 --> 01:21:09,299
or for worse.
