1
00:00:24,111 --> 00:00:28,724
[clock ticking]

2
00:00:31,074 --> 00:00:31,727
[typing]

3
00:00:34,512 --> 00:00:37,602
[man] We are going through
the most profound change

4
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:41,302
in communication technologies
in all of human history
right now.

5
00:00:43,304 --> 00:00:45,828
[chattering]

6
00:00:45,915 --> 00:00:50,441
Printing press,
radio, telegraph, television.
All very important.

7
00:00:50,528 --> 00:00:54,228
But I believe we're going
through the most transformative,

8
00:00:54,315 --> 00:00:57,579
purely on the basis
of three technologies.

9
00:00:57,666 --> 00:01:00,669
Mobile, social media
and cloud computing.

10
00:01:07,937 --> 00:01:10,505
They share one
very important characteristic.

11
00:01:10,592 --> 00:01:14,291
And that's the amount
of private information.

12
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:17,903
Information that used to
be in our desktops
or filing cabinets,

13
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,514
even in our heads,

14
00:01:19,601 --> 00:01:22,430
that we now
entrust to third parties.

15
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:24,910
[whirring]

16
00:01:24,997 --> 00:01:28,653
Data that we are conscious of,
and deliberate about,

17
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,743
like the e-mails we send
and the tweets we post.

18
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,398
But it also includes
a lot of information

19
00:01:34,485 --> 00:01:37,358
that we're completely,
or mostly, unconscious about.

20
00:01:38,663 --> 00:01:40,622
So if you take my mobile phone,

21
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:44,060
even when I'm not using it,
it's emitting a pulse,

22
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:47,846
trying to locate
the nearest Wi-Fi router
or cell phone exchange,

23
00:01:47,933 --> 00:01:50,719
and within that beacon is
the make and model of the phone,

24
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:53,461
the fact that it's my phone,

25
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:56,507
because my name is attached
to the operating system,

26
00:01:56,594 --> 00:01:59,423
and most importantly,
the geolocation of the phone.

27
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:02,557
[drone humming]

28
00:02:02,644 --> 00:02:04,385
[man speaking Portuguese]

29
00:02:10,086 --> 00:02:12,915
[Deibert continues]
We are leaving
this digital exhaust

30
00:02:13,002 --> 00:02:17,876
that contains
extraordinarily precise
information about our lives,

31
00:02:17,963 --> 00:02:22,446
our social relationships
reduced to
trillions of data points

32
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:27,234
that form now
this new ethereal layer
around the planet

33
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:29,845
that's only growing
in all directions.

34
00:02:29,932 --> 00:02:34,719
[ticking]

35
00:02:34,806 --> 00:02:38,419
Capabilities are being put
in the hands of policy makers,

36
00:02:38,506 --> 00:02:42,162
five years ago,
they'd never imagine
that they would have.

37
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:45,991
This is where big
data meets Big Brother.

38
00:02:46,905 --> 00:02:50,257
[ticking]

39
00:02:56,524 --> 00:03:00,832
[buzzing]

40
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:07,274
-[folk music]
-[chuckles]

41
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:08,318
[man with accent]
Should be here.

42
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,540
[American man]
It is kind of in a rock,
I think.

43
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:14,498
[American man #2]
Yeah, the entrance is in a rock.

44
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:16,500
-[speaking over each other]
-Or a bunker.

45
00:03:16,587 --> 00:03:18,546
Oh, yeah, the bunker.
It is down there!

46
00:03:21,897 --> 00:03:23,507
[driver]
There is a bunker
under here.

47
00:03:23,594 --> 00:03:27,032
-[man] Yeah.
-It is between 33 and 39.

48
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:28,338
[Deibert] Right there.
Look at that door.

49
00:03:28,425 --> 00:03:29,600
[driver] Yeah.[Deibert] Yeah, this is it.

50
00:03:29,687 --> 00:03:31,559
Bahnhof.[driver] Okay.

51
00:03:42,265 --> 00:03:43,527
[beeps]

52
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:55,844
[door squeaks]Hey, I guess we just go in.

53
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:04,592
[electronica music]

54
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:19,520
[servers whirring]

55
00:04:21,391 --> 00:04:24,525
[electronica continues]

56
00:04:26,788 --> 00:04:28,790
What's your favorite
part of the building?

57
00:04:28,877 --> 00:04:30,835
I think it's here.
I mean, I love it.

58
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:33,316
Yeah.[loud whirring]

59
00:04:33,403 --> 00:04:35,797
All the energy down here.
The noise and stuff
like that.

60
00:04:35,884 --> 00:04:38,495
It's kind of a...It's like being in a hive.

61
00:04:38,582 --> 00:04:39,583
Yeah.Yeah, exactly.

62
00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:00,256
Many people believe that
you have this cloud services
that are floating around.

63
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:02,519
People think, "Okay,
it's a cloud server."

64
00:05:02,606 --> 00:05:06,044
But this is
the actual physical location
of the Internet.

65
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:09,004
[whirring, clicking]

66
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:17,795
[Karlung continues]
It's a constant struggle
to protect data.

67
00:05:17,882 --> 00:05:22,322
[voices echo]

68
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:26,674
The Swedish Security Police
wanted to install tools

69
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:32,027
to automatically
log in to our data
and get out the information.

70
00:05:33,202 --> 00:05:35,204
So I invited them
to our facility,

71
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,511
and then I had a microphone

72
00:05:37,598 --> 00:05:42,777
which I was provided
by the Swedish Public Service,
national radio.

73
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:51,568
[speaking Swedish]

74
00:05:57,313 --> 00:06:00,447
I taped this conversation,
and they were so angry.

75
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:03,493
And they also wanted us
to sign a paper

76
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,975
where they said that
we could not say
anything about it.

77
00:06:07,062 --> 00:06:08,933
It should be total secrecy.

78
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:13,373
They said,
"If a terrorist attack happens,
it's your fault."

79
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,765
[click, buzz]

80
00:06:14,852 --> 00:06:20,641
[man speaks Swedish]

81
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,564
[Karlung]
It's, like, a creepy feeling.

82
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:34,219
Nobody can say that
any facility is safe.

83
00:06:34,306 --> 00:06:39,181
There are always possibilities
to go in and find data
and take it out.

84
00:06:42,793 --> 00:06:46,275
People say that,
"Oh, I don't have
anything to hide.

85
00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:48,059
They can read my mail.
I don't have anything."

86
00:06:48,146 --> 00:06:51,193
But it's not that
which is this problem.

87
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,676
The problem is, without secrecy,
there can be no democracy.

88
00:06:55,763 --> 00:06:58,505
Without secrecy,
there can be no market economy.

89
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:00,855
Right.

90
00:07:00,942 --> 00:07:03,597
There is an obvious candidate
for the Nobel Peace Prize.

91
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:06,034
Really?And that is Edward Snowden.

92
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:07,514
I mean, yeah.

93
00:07:21,571 --> 00:07:28,186
Does the public enjoy
the same right to privacy
that we have in the past?

94
00:07:28,273 --> 00:07:30,972
Are we still private citizens,

95
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:34,584
and then public officials,
where the government knows
very little about us,

96
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:36,107
but we know
everything about them?

97
00:07:36,194 --> 00:07:39,197
Why are we, the public,
becoming disempowered

98
00:07:39,284 --> 00:07:42,026
at the same time
that governments
around the world,

99
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:47,336
corporations around the world,
institutions around the world,

100
00:07:47,423 --> 00:07:52,210
are gaining greater
and greater leverage over
the range of our activities,

101
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:54,430
their knowledge of what we do?

102
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:10,228
[Deibert] The Citizen Lab
is an unusual place.

103
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:13,449
[cell phones ringing]

104
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:16,583
We're a research unit
at the University of Toronto.

105
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:22,371
We combine the skills
of engineers,
computer scientists

106
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,155
with social scientists.

107
00:08:24,242 --> 00:08:26,810
We collaborate with people
from all over the world

108
00:08:26,897 --> 00:08:29,073
to do the field research
that we do.

109
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,512
And we do this
to advance research
on global security,

110
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:34,514
cyberspace
and human rights.

111
00:08:37,386 --> 00:08:39,214
The world is
a very dangerous place

112
00:08:39,301 --> 00:08:42,522
as we saw recently in...
in tragic incidents
in Paris,

113
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:47,265
and you want to
have security agencies
be well adept at discerning

114
00:08:47,352 --> 00:08:49,703
what those threats
are over our horizon.

115
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:55,099
But is it okay
that the government sets up
a giant digital X-ray machine

116
00:08:55,186 --> 00:08:56,971
over everything that we do?

117
00:08:57,058 --> 00:08:59,147
Because that's effectively
where we're headed right now.

118
00:08:59,234 --> 00:09:00,540
[typing]

119
00:09:02,716 --> 00:09:05,762
[continues]
We've been a kind of
digital early warning system,

120
00:09:05,849 --> 00:09:07,982
scanning the horizon.

121
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:10,898
And what we've seen, frankly,
has been really disturbing.

122
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:13,161
[digital chirping]

123
00:09:14,771 --> 00:09:16,338

124

125

[chanting in Tibetan]

126
00:09:37,185 --> 00:09:39,796
[man, in Tibetan]
It was around 4:30.
We had just finished praying.

127
00:09:43,974 --> 00:09:49,197
Sixty or 70 police arrived along
with 300 or 400 soldiers.

128
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:52,940
They forced their
way into the monastery.

129
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:03,559
[chimes playing]

130
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:19,488
[Golog, in Tibetan]
They started ransacking
the monastery.

131
00:10:19,575 --> 00:10:23,797
All the monks were asking,
"Why are they here?
What are they doing here?"

132
00:10:23,884 --> 00:10:26,626
Everyone was nervous.
I had a sinking feeling.

133
00:10:26,713 --> 00:10:30,107
One of the monastery's artists
was arguing with the police,
and I tried to intercede.

134
00:10:30,194 --> 00:10:33,545
Suddenly my phone rang,
so I quickly switched it off.

135
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,897
I switched off my phone.

136
00:10:43,555 --> 00:10:47,472
We could hear the police outside
talking in Chinese
on walkie-talkies.

137
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:49,910
Then the police searching inside
were called out.

138
00:10:51,476 --> 00:10:53,957
I could see one of them
looking closely at a photo.

139
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:56,307
But I couldn't see
if it was a photo of me or not.

140
00:10:56,394 --> 00:11:00,224
Then they came back in
and pointed a gun
to each of our heads,

141
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:04,359
and we were told to put
our phones down on the ground
in front of them...

142
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:08,580
as they kept us all at gunpoint.

143
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:14,630
So I switched my phone back on

144
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:17,981
and put it down
in front of them.

145
00:11:23,421 --> 00:11:28,557
[vibrates]

146
00:11:28,644 --> 00:11:30,994
Just after I switched it
back on, my phone rang.

147
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,394
The police asked, "Whose phone
is this?" I said, "It's mine."

148

-[shouts]
-[blows landing]

149
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:47,619
They started beating me
with their rifles,

150
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,796
striking me with the points
and the butts of their guns.

151
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:55,018
-[shouting in Tibetan]
-[blows landing]

152
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:57,412
Then a bunch of them grabbed me,
and dragged me away.

153
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:02,722
[beating continues]

154
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:09,685
[stops]

155
00:12:13,167 --> 00:12:19,695
[Golog]
They had complete records
of all our phone conversations.

156
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:23,743
They knew everything.

157
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:27,703
[vehicle horns honking]

158
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,495
[woman, in English]
Tibetans are watched from every
angle and from every corner.

159
00:12:37,582 --> 00:12:41,282
It's in their homes,
it's in their offices,
it's in the streets.

160
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:43,240
In Tibet,
certainly in central Tibet

161
00:12:43,327 --> 00:12:45,765
and around
the capital city of Lhasa,

162
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:49,246
Chinese authorities,
together with
Chinese corporations,

163
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,509
telecommunications companies,

164
00:12:51,596 --> 00:12:56,210
they've integrated
the ability to spy on people
via their mobile phone,

165
00:12:56,297 --> 00:12:59,213
via the last communications they
may have had over the Internet.

166
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,477
Down to the closed circuit
television camera
on the streets.

167
00:13:04,131 --> 00:13:07,134
The Chinese so strictly
control access to Tibet,

168
00:13:07,221 --> 00:13:09,092
it's just like a black hole

169
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:12,400
for media,
for independent observers,

170
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:14,097
for international agencies,
for anything.

171
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:23,454
[Golog, in Tibetan]
Ever since I started being
politically active,

172
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:27,589
I never gave a thought
to my own security.

173
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:33,421
I just see it
as a responsibility
that comes with being Tibetan.

174
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,909
[woman speaks in Tibetan]

175
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:49,089
[Golog]
How I escaped is a secret.

176
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:51,091
[light music]

177
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:10,371
[Tethong]
People
are incredibly courageous.

178
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:13,635
People inside Tibet will
send out news and information.

179
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:16,681
And they'll say,
"I want this story to be told."

180
00:14:17,813 --> 00:14:19,119
They could be imprisoned.

181
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:20,598
They could be tortured.

182
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:22,209
Their family
could pay the price.

183
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:23,558
[music continues]

184
00:14:23,645 --> 00:14:25,777
We on the outside have to decide

185
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:31,348
how to walk this very,
sort of, fine line between
protecting people's security

186
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:35,048
and honoring their wishes
about getting news
and information out.

187
00:14:35,135 --> 00:14:39,530
And we know for a fact,
thanks to Citizen Lab's report,

188
00:14:39,617 --> 00:14:42,620
that we are being
successfully targeted.

189
00:14:42,707 --> 00:14:44,666
[music stops]

190
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:49,236
A new report has been released
from a group
of digital detectives.

191
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:53,153
From their computers in Toronto,
they've tracked
a high-tech spy ring

192
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,545
that reaches around the world.

193
00:14:55,372 --> 00:14:57,505
[typewriter clicks]

194
00:14:59,246 --> 00:15:00,638
[reporter] For the past ten months,

195
00:15:00,725 --> 00:15:03,728
these computer experts have been working as cyber sleuths

196
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:07,036
hot on the trail of a massive electronic spy network.

197
00:15:07,123 --> 00:15:11,388
They say it has taken control of nearly 1,300 high-level computers

198
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:13,608
in more than 100 countries.

199
00:15:13,695 --> 00:15:17,133
A discovery that could have major political implications.

200
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,788
They can extract any
document they wanted.

201
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:23,748
They could turn on web cameras,
turn on audio devices,

202
00:15:23,835 --> 00:15:25,794
so that they could,
in effect, use the computers

203
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:27,839
as a listening device
in the offices.

204
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,494
[reporter] The web of intrigue started with the Dalai Lama

205
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:32,279
who thought his computer had been hacked.

206
00:15:36,631 --> 00:15:41,244
Up until about 2007 or 2008,
I'd never really heard
of malware.

207
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:43,681
You know, I'd heard
of viruses, obviously,

208
00:15:43,768 --> 00:15:46,641
but I hadn't really heard
about targeted malware attacks

209
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:48,251
affecting
the human rights community.

210
00:15:48,338 --> 00:15:49,557
[clicking]

211
00:15:53,822 --> 00:15:57,130
First time I heard about it was
in the context of the Tibetans.

212
00:15:57,217 --> 00:16:01,699
Gradually
we started piecing together,
they are under surveillance.

213
00:16:01,786 --> 00:16:05,877
The surveillance comes
from groups within China.

214
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:10,970
They're using malicious software
and socially-engineered e-mails.

215
00:16:11,057 --> 00:16:13,581
E-mails that are crafted
to get them to open it up

216
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:15,409
to get inside their devices.

217
00:16:16,932 --> 00:16:18,978
[reporter] Nart Villeneuve, a computer wiz,

218
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:21,197
figured out how the operation worked

219
00:16:21,284 --> 00:16:24,026
by getting the attackers to hack into his computer.

220
00:16:24,113 --> 00:16:25,723
We're monitoring these groups

221
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,943
for long periods of time,

222
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,859
and you're essentially waiting
for them to screw up, right?

223
00:16:30,946 --> 00:16:32,904
And when they do,
you take advantage of that.

224
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,081
Sometimes it takes a long time.

225
00:16:35,168 --> 00:16:38,127
You could be monitoring a group
for a year and get nothing.

226
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:42,697
Then one day,
they just use a server
that they don't lock down

227
00:16:42,784 --> 00:16:44,438
and all the data's
just sitting there.

228
00:16:46,396 --> 00:16:48,964
I was at home.
It was pretty late.

229
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,575
[typing]

230
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:21,823
[Deibert]
Nart was scouring through it,

231
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,565
trying to figure out
what actor is responsible

232
00:17:24,652 --> 00:17:26,828
for getting inside
the Dalai Lama's office.

233
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:30,919
And there was
a 22 or 24 character string
that kept coming up

234
00:17:31,006 --> 00:17:33,574
that he couldn't figure out,
"What is the meaning of this?"

235
00:17:33,661 --> 00:17:37,926
So on a whim, he just copied
and pasted it into Google.

236
00:17:38,013 --> 00:17:41,147
One website came up,
and it was Chinese characters.

237
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:46,369
So he clicked on it.

238
00:17:46,456 --> 00:17:47,414
[mouse clicks]

239
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:52,854
To my surprise,
what came back
was the actual page

240
00:17:52,941 --> 00:17:57,163
that the attackers used
to interface
with the compromised systems.

241
00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:01,123
So they set up a website
where they could monitor
their victims.

242
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,256
But they didn't
password protect it!

243
00:18:03,343 --> 00:18:06,172
So it was like a window
into everything they were doing.

244
00:18:07,695 --> 00:18:10,176
[electronic music]

245
00:18:16,965 --> 00:18:20,186
[Nart]
This wasn't just targeted
at Tibetan organizations

246
00:18:20,273 --> 00:18:22,536
or human rights organizations.

247
00:18:22,623 --> 00:18:26,627
This was global,
a pretty wide range
of institutions

248
00:18:26,714 --> 00:18:29,586
that showed that
these attackers were...
were quite busy.

249
00:18:29,673 --> 00:18:32,111
There was huge pickup
in the media.
It was all over the world.

250
00:18:38,726 --> 00:18:42,382
And it put us on
a different kind of footing
in terms of our credibility.

251
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,563
In the cyber security community,
we were novices at that time.

252
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:50,564
We were kind of outsiders.

253
00:18:51,782 --> 00:18:53,175
[no audible dialogue]

254
00:18:53,262 --> 00:18:56,091
So we were kind of
calling it on the fly.

255
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:57,962
Like, what do we do?
What's the right thing to do?

256
00:18:58,049 --> 00:18:59,442
Who do we notify?

257
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:02,010
I knew that publishing it
was important.

258
00:19:02,097 --> 00:19:04,534
We had to redact
a lot of the information
to protect people.

259
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:06,971
Should we notify the government?

260
00:19:07,058 --> 00:19:08,886
Should we notify
the Canadian government?

261
00:19:08,973 --> 00:19:12,847
How do we notify
other governments
that are being victimized?

262
00:19:12,934 --> 00:19:14,631
At the time, you know,

263
00:19:14,718 --> 00:19:17,417
we didn't want
to completely disclose
everything that we had done,

264
00:19:17,504 --> 00:19:19,419
because we
wanted to do it again.

265
00:19:19,506 --> 00:19:22,900
[Deibert]
In some of the communities
I mentioned, they loved it.

266
00:19:22,987 --> 00:19:26,252
But I got the feeling from,
certainly inside
my own government,

267
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:28,079
there was a lot of weirdness.

268
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:31,474
[interviewer]
Are we allowed to speculate?Well, I think now we know

269
00:19:31,561 --> 00:19:36,175
because there's
a Snowden disclosure that
explicitly references the fact

270
00:19:36,262 --> 00:19:38,655
that the Canadians
and the Americans,

271
00:19:38,742 --> 00:19:40,701
our signal's
intelligence agencies,

272
00:19:40,788 --> 00:19:43,791
were piggybacking
off the GhostNet network.

273
00:19:43,878 --> 00:19:47,447
So, in publishing the report,
we basically broke up
their party.

274
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:59,459
From our initial samples from
the office of the Dalai Lama,

275
00:19:59,546 --> 00:20:02,375
they were actually compromised
by two distinct groups.

276
00:20:02,462 --> 00:20:05,552
The GhostNet group obviously
got the most attention.

277
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:08,424
But there was another group
that was also active.

278
00:20:08,511 --> 00:20:10,905
The GhostNet group
shut down their operations,

279
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:14,822
but the other group, um,
they're still going.

Tibetan through megaphone]

286
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:19,713
The vast majority of Tibetans
inside of Tibet use WeChat.

287
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,587
But it's both
a blessing and a curse.

[woman speaking Tibetan]

289
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:35,555
[Golog]
QQ is Chinese-made.
WeChat is Chinese-made.

290
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:42,083
All these social media apps
come from China.

291
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:46,914
If someone in Lhasa
or Nagchu were to post a photo
of His Holiness on WeChat,

292
00:21:48,045 --> 00:21:53,094
they would be caught
immediately.

293
00:21:58,578 --> 00:22:01,755
In our research,
what we see are acts of war

294
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:05,106
that take place
against citizens,

295
00:22:05,193 --> 00:22:07,108
using these very technologies.

296
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:10,154
Getting inside
the computers of Tibetans
and then arresting them,

297
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:14,071
and possibly executing them,
is a kind of act of war.

298

299
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,076
[Deibert]
We see this sort of thing
every week, right?

300
00:22:19,163 --> 00:22:21,427
Minor to major versions of it.

301
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:28,042
Everything on the site
is correct except this.

302
00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:32,089
So this... The last log-in on
the C panel was from Korea.

303
00:22:32,176 --> 00:22:34,440
Mm-hmm.Do you guys have any work
in Korea?

304
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:36,398
Is there any...No, no...

305
00:22:36,485 --> 00:22:39,358
So who actually accesses
the website to update it
and all that sort of thing?

306
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:41,621
It must be
someone unauthorized.Yeah.

For me, Tibet is a memory.

It's like a reoccurring dream.

00:23:33,107 --> 00:23:34,587
This photo is full of memories.

00:23:34,674 --> 00:23:36,937
If I close my eyes,
I can see it all vividly.

315
00:23:37,024 --> 00:23:41,115
This is the hall where
we prayed and made offerings.

316
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:48,122
On this side are
all of my classmates.

317
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:52,431
This is one of my best friends.

00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:14,235
[in Tibetan]
I use these different phones to
contact Tibetans inside Tibet.

322
00:24:14,322 --> 00:24:17,499
I don't use my personal phone.

323
00:24:17,586 --> 00:24:20,415
I'm constantly switching
the number that I use.

324
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:25,638
If you call too many times
from the same number,
it will get blacklisted.

325
00:24:25,725 --> 00:24:31,513
Then, when they catch you using
a blacklisted number,
they'll investigate.

326
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,385
Who's calling?
And who are they calling to?

327
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:44,700
Since 2008, I've kept contacts
in Tibet so I can find out
what's happening there.

328
00:24:44,787 --> 00:24:49,052
Most of the news I receive
regards peoples' suffering.

329
00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:52,795
For example,
people being killed,
arrested, disappearing.

330
00:24:52,882 --> 00:24:56,277
Children being separated
from their parents.

331
00:24:56,364 --> 00:24:59,759
When the parents of
a child are arrested,

332
00:24:59,846 --> 00:25:02,936
often the children are left
with no one to care for them.

335
00:25:22,433 --> 00:25:26,350
When somebody self-immolates,
communicating
is even more dangerous.

336
00:25:26,437 --> 00:25:29,092
Even though it makes me uneasy,
I have to ask for details.

the whole story out,
it's a great loss.

339
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,985

[indistinct]Hmm.

347
00:26:29,805 --> 00:26:34,331
This video was aired
by BBC and Al Jazeera.

348
00:26:34,418 --> 00:26:37,770
A lot of news agencies aired it.
It's only a few seconds,

349
00:26:37,857 --> 00:26:44,559
but it proves that
many of the things we've been
reporting are a reality.

350
00:26:44,646 --> 00:26:49,520
And now it's documented.
You can Google it
and find photos.

351
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,218
It's everywhere.
There's no risk of losing it.

352
00:26:51,305 --> 00:26:54,047
[typing]

353
00:27:17,418 --> 00:27:20,595
[talking, quiet]

354
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:35,741
Not that long ago,
the government of Pakistan
put out this tender

355
00:27:35,828 --> 00:27:40,136
for proposals for a nationwide
Internet filtering system.

356
00:27:40,223 --> 00:27:43,444
They wanted to solicit proposals
from companies to build,

357
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:46,316
effectively,
the Great Firewall of Pakistan.

358
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:56,065
Today if you visit Pakistan
and you get online

359
00:27:56,152 --> 00:27:59,808
and you try to access YouTube,
this is what you'll see,

360
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,158
a blocked page like this.

361
00:28:07,163 --> 00:28:09,296
I'm in Islamabad,
putting in a SIM card.

362
00:28:13,517 --> 00:28:16,259
First and foremost,
I'm really excited
to see Shahzad.

363
00:28:16,346 --> 00:28:20,611
I first met Shahzad and
the organization Bytes for All,

364
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:21,917
eight years ago, I think?

365
00:28:22,004 --> 00:28:24,746
And he's been involved,
in one way or another,

366
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:26,661
in Citizen Lab research
ever since.

367
00:28:28,576 --> 00:28:30,317
[mouse clicks]

368
00:28:36,497 --> 00:28:39,761
[chattering]

369
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:42,808
-Hi, Shahzad.
-Hello!

370
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:48,030
So great to see you.Here we are.
Here we are.

371
00:28:48,117 --> 00:28:49,945
[both chuckling]

372
00:28:50,032 --> 00:28:52,252
[Deibert]
Bytes for All does what they do,

373
00:28:52,339 --> 00:28:56,430
fight for Internet rights
and advocacy-based
approach to Internet freedom

374
00:28:56,517 --> 00:28:58,998
under extreme duress.

375
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:01,609
So they're operating
in a country that,

376
00:29:01,696 --> 00:29:04,438
specifically around media
and free expression,

377
00:29:04,525 --> 00:29:06,701
has got to be one of
the worst places in the world.

378
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:10,270
Uh, journalists are
routinely kidnapped, murdered,

379
00:29:10,357 --> 00:29:13,055
uh, offices firebombed,
et cetera,

380
00:29:13,142 --> 00:29:15,318
and they've experienced
all of that.

381
00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:20,019
Death threats,
staff members kidnapped,

382
00:29:20,106 --> 00:29:24,023
his own son beat up and
thrown to the side of the road

383
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:27,113
as a warning to Shahzad
not to do what he's doing.

384
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:33,597
In my opinion,

385
00:29:33,684 --> 00:29:37,863
Internet has opened up
so many opportunities...

386
00:29:39,081 --> 00:29:40,779
for the people to express,

387
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:45,044
and that is the sole reason
that we are fighting
for open Internet.

388
00:29:45,131 --> 00:29:48,743
They lost their public spaces.

389
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:52,529
They lost their ability
to go out freely.

390
00:29:52,616 --> 00:29:56,490
So, as they are putting controls
and curbs on physical spaces,

391
00:29:56,577 --> 00:30:00,537
they are doing exactly the same
in online spaces as well.

392
00:30:00,624 --> 00:30:04,411
So precisely the reason
we are standing out there
to reclaim those spaces.

393
00:30:04,498 --> 00:30:06,021
And we have to at some point,

394
00:30:06,108 --> 00:30:07,806
and we'll continue to do that.

395
00:30:09,111 --> 00:30:11,722
Oh, my God. [sighs]

396
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,248
The government has the ability
to ban specific pages.

397
00:30:15,335 --> 00:30:17,380
[speaking foreign language]

398
00:30:17,467 --> 00:30:19,643
[in English]
You ban all of Facebook,
businesses are suffering,

399
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:20,819
people communicate.

400
00:30:20,906 --> 00:30:23,647
I mean, you can
laugh and joke and say,

401
00:30:23,734 --> 00:30:26,346
"For a few days people
won't play FarmVille,"
but it's not about that.

402
00:30:26,433 --> 00:30:29,740
It's about your fundamental
rights being snatched from you

403
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:33,179
and no government,
in my opinion, should have
the ability to do that.

404
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:34,702
[woman] Right.

405
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:37,836
Not only that, they banned
Wikipedia for a little while.

406
00:30:37,923 --> 00:30:39,315
-Yes, mm-hmm.
-YouTube.

407
00:30:39,402 --> 00:30:42,710
Uh, about several thousand
websites were affected.

408
00:30:42,797 --> 00:30:46,235
I think the Internet is
this vast, unregulated,

409
00:30:46,322 --> 00:30:48,890
wonderful, democratizing space

410
00:30:48,977 --> 00:30:51,545
and no matter what anyone does,
people will find a way.

414
00:31:43,858 --> 00:31:46,948
Hi, I'm Sabeen Mahmud,
and I'm the director
of Peace Nation,

415
00:31:47,035 --> 00:31:49,037
a non-profit organization.

416
00:31:49,124 --> 00:31:52,040
I've always believed
that technology is
always the driver of change,

417
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:55,130
not business, not government,
but technology.

418
00:31:55,217 --> 00:32:00,222
And gender-based violence
has always existed

419
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:03,834
but with the advent
of the Internet and the number
of social networking tools,

420
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,750
I think it's
a great mobilization platform.

421
00:32:06,837 --> 00:32:07,882

423
00:32:26,074 --> 00:32:28,685
[anchor] Sabeen Mahmud
was leaving a Karachi restaurant

424
00:32:28,772 --> 00:32:31,340
when the gunman
attacked her in her car.

425
00:32:31,427 --> 00:32:34,561
Her mother who was also
accompanying her was wounded

426
00:32:34,648 --> 00:32:36,780
and now is in a critical
condition.

427
00:32:36,867 --> 00:32:40,132
Mahmud was taken to a hospital
where she was pronounced dead.

428
00:32:40,219 --> 00:32:41,437
[sitar music continues]

429
00:32:52,318 --> 00:32:56,583
[inaudible]

430
00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:01,762
When she spoke
in physical spaces,
nothing happened.

431
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:05,461
When she was
carrying on her campaign,
she was not targeted.

432
00:33:05,548 --> 00:33:07,550
People were amused or they
ignored her,

433
00:33:07,637 --> 00:33:09,813
or they just walked past.

434
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:14,166
But when this whole, sort of,
campaign

435
00:33:14,253 --> 00:33:16,516
hit the Internet
and the social media,

436
00:33:16,603 --> 00:33:18,735
that's when
the lynch mobs gathered.

437
00:33:18,822 --> 00:33:21,347
And one of
the reasons I find is,

438
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:27,396
that speech
in a physical space lasts
only as long as you're speaking.

439
00:33:27,483 --> 00:33:33,750
But once it is uploaded onto
the Internet on any platform,
it is there forever.

440
00:33:33,837 --> 00:33:38,320
And then your attackers or
you know, whoever opposes you,

441
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:40,627
they gather,
and then they spread it further

442
00:33:40,714 --> 00:33:44,065
and more and more
people join that group

443
00:33:44,152 --> 00:33:47,634
of people who are attacking and
it takes on a life of its own.

[chattering]

445
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:10,396
[Deibert] We're going through
a demographic revolution.

446
00:34:10,483 --> 00:34:15,314
The center of gravity
of cyberspace is shifting
right before our eyes.

447
00:34:15,401 --> 00:34:18,752
From the north
and the west of the planet,

to the South and the East.

449
00:34:21,407 --> 00:34:25,498
The vast majority of Internet
users today and into the future

450
00:34:25,585 --> 00:34:27,543
are coming
from the developing world,

451
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:30,938
for whom these technologies
are empowering.

452
00:34:31,025 --> 00:34:35,986
What should we expect then from
these next billion digital users

453
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,685

I'm sure that FIFA
has been bad for Rio de Janeiro.

466

There's no education,
no public health,

For 250,000 families

there is no World Cup.

479

and we went to the streets
and tried to do live streaming.

480
00:36:54,516 --> 00:36:58,259
There was a mobile station

00:37:43,217 --> 00:37:48,744

might have read it

675
00:50:40,341 --> 00:50:43,170
and that somebody
wants to hunt you down.

676
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:05,497
And when I came to the UK,

677
00:51:05,584 --> 00:51:09,153
there was a total liberation
of that stress.

678
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,591
I felt,
"I am living in a free country

679
00:51:12,678 --> 00:51:15,028
where the privacy of individuals
is respected

680
00:51:16,203 --> 00:51:18,423
and my privacy is
also respected."

681
00:51:19,206 --> 00:51:20,642
But I was wrong.

682
00:51:24,255 --> 00:51:27,040
Sometime in 2013,

683
00:51:27,127 --> 00:51:32,437
we started to find
some of the things that we
discussed among a small circle

684
00:51:32,524 --> 00:51:37,181
in open media
and in unfriendly medias
of the Ethiopian government.

685
00:51:40,488 --> 00:51:43,230
You don't want to
suspect your friend,
but you have to.

686
00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:48,757
And we keep on wondering
how they could find out.

687
00:51:51,586 --> 00:51:55,634
We got the answer
from a totally unexpected area.

688
00:51:55,721 --> 00:51:59,899
A certain group of people
goes to Citizen Lab.

689
00:51:59,986 --> 00:52:03,555
And they published a report.

690
00:52:03,642 --> 00:52:07,472
And in that report
there was my photograph,

691
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:12,651
and they used it
to attach with the spyware

692
00:52:12,738 --> 00:52:15,132
and distribute it
among the Ethiopian community.

693
00:52:19,005 --> 00:52:23,836
The attacker has to socially
engineer or convince the target

694
00:52:23,923 --> 00:52:28,580
to open a file or to,
you know, click through
some security warning,

695
00:52:28,667 --> 00:52:31,148
um, in order to become infected.

696
00:52:31,235 --> 00:52:36,370
We had found a document
that had pictures of Ethiopian
opposition leaders in it,

697
00:52:36,457 --> 00:52:38,851
and it looked like
it was targeted
and designed to appeal

698
00:52:38,938 --> 00:52:41,245
to members of
the Ethiopian diaspora.

699
00:52:41,332 --> 00:52:44,030
Uh, but in fact,
the file was cleverly disguised

700
00:52:44,117 --> 00:52:46,728
to look like a document
that's actually
a computer program,

701
00:52:46,815 --> 00:52:48,426
an executable file.

702
00:52:48,513 --> 00:52:50,732
So when you run this,
it will install software
on your computer

703
00:52:50,819 --> 00:52:53,387
even though, you know, they
changed the icon and everything

704
00:52:53,474 --> 00:52:56,521
to make it look like
this is a document
or a picture.

705
00:52:56,608 --> 00:52:57,783
This is actually a program.

706
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,963
After that,
I just tried to scan...

707
00:53:05,617 --> 00:53:09,098
people who were arrested
after my departure.

708
00:53:10,839 --> 00:53:14,887
I had a friend in Saudi Arabia
who was sent back to Ethiopia,

709
00:53:14,974 --> 00:53:17,629
and arrested and
sentenced to 18 years.

710
00:53:17,716 --> 00:53:20,632
And I started to question,
probably it was because of me.

711
00:53:23,722 --> 00:53:25,027
And he's not the only person.

712
00:53:32,121 --> 00:53:35,255
I was able to look at the memory
of an infected computer.

713
00:53:35,342 --> 00:53:38,171
In other words,
what's going on inside
the computer when it's infected.

714
00:53:38,258 --> 00:53:42,480
And I was able to identify
several interesting artifacts
in the memory,

715
00:53:42,567 --> 00:53:45,700
including a bunch of strings
that said "FinFisher," "FinSpy,"

716
00:53:45,787 --> 00:53:48,137
very clearly attributing this
to the company.

717
00:53:51,402 --> 00:53:55,057
Ethiopia is
one of the poorest countries
in the world.

718
00:53:55,144 --> 00:54:00,498
Internet users in Ethiopia
are less than two percent.

719
00:54:00,585 --> 00:54:03,152
It is the lowest in the world.

720
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:09,115
But they spend
millions of dollars
for FinFisher.

721
00:54:09,202 --> 00:54:14,729
For spying on people like me,
who are trying to do...

722
00:54:14,816 --> 00:54:19,168
to bring a better future
to Ethiopia.

723
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:27,960
You don't have to be the NSA to
get inside somebody's computer.

724
00:54:28,047 --> 00:54:31,355
Um, instead you can
exploit their curiosity,

725
00:54:31,442 --> 00:54:35,228
their, um, need to communicate.

726
00:54:35,315 --> 00:54:38,753
And of course,
journalists, at the very heart
of what they do,

727
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:42,757
is engage in communication
with a lot of people

728
00:54:42,844 --> 00:54:45,630
and a lot of people that
they don't know and trust
necessarily.

729
00:54:45,717 --> 00:54:49,024
Because they're engaged
in outreach and communicating
constantly with sources.

730
00:54:49,111 --> 00:54:51,288
[crowd shouting]

731
00:54:57,729 --> 00:55:00,079
[cheering, whistling]

732
00:55:02,647 --> 00:55:06,477
Fifty years ago,
nobody would have known
what happened in Syria.

733
00:55:06,564 --> 00:55:10,611
But in 2011, when it started,
everybody had Facebook.

734
00:55:10,698 --> 00:55:16,313
Everybody has e-mails
and everybody has WhatsApp
and Viber.

735
00:55:17,618 --> 00:55:19,490
So you just can't stop people

736
00:55:19,577 --> 00:55:22,362
from telling
what is happening to them.

737
00:55:22,449 --> 00:55:25,365
So when they besieged Daraa
at the beginning,

738
00:55:25,452 --> 00:55:30,065
they shut down communication,
Internet, land lines
and even electricity.

739
00:55:30,152 --> 00:55:34,331
But they did not know that
in the 21st century,
people have their ways.

740
00:55:34,418 --> 00:55:37,464
People were charging
their mobiles from their cars
or generators,

741
00:55:37,551 --> 00:55:40,989
hand generators,
um, manual generators.

742
00:55:41,076 --> 00:55:44,993
And people were using
satellite connections.

743
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:49,694
You don't need to use
the country, uh, Internet
to be connected to the Internet.

744
00:55:49,781 --> 00:55:51,217
You can use anything.

745
00:55:51,304 --> 00:55:55,221
And they were able to tell
what was happening to them.

746
00:55:55,308 --> 00:56:00,922
Um, so the story got around.

747
00:56:01,009 --> 00:56:02,968
[man speaking foreign language]

748
00:56:03,055 --> 00:56:05,144
[sirens blaring]

749
00:56:09,453 --> 00:56:13,239
A few years ago many of us
celebrated the Arab Spring

750
00:56:13,326 --> 00:56:16,416
as the paradigm of what
these technologies could do.

751
00:56:16,503 --> 00:56:19,637
Remember
we called it at the time
"liberation technology."

752
00:56:19,724 --> 00:56:21,813
It would bring about the end
of authoritarian rule.

753
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,728
[man speaking Arabic]

754
00:56:29,777 --> 00:56:35,522
Unfortunately,
Syria has become the
Arab Spring's dark aftermath.

755
00:56:35,609 --> 00:56:36,784
[explosion]

756
00:56:36,871 --> 00:56:40,658
[boy shouting in Arabic]

757
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:45,924
As groups
sympathetic to the Assad regime

758
00:56:46,011 --> 00:56:50,276
have employed
off-the-shelf malware crime kits
to infiltrate social networks,

759
00:56:50,363 --> 00:56:53,671
arrest, torture and
murder opposition groups

760
00:56:53,758 --> 00:56:55,673
and even target
their air strikes.

761
00:57:03,463 --> 00:57:04,377
[rifles cocking]

762
00:57:10,165 --> 00:57:11,036
[shouting]

763
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,220
[gunshot]

764
00:57:24,919 --> 00:57:28,619
[man] From the beginning,
we believed that the camera
is the most powerful weapon,

765
00:57:28,706 --> 00:57:31,012
and it was actually
the only weapon we have

766
00:57:31,099 --> 00:57:33,014
to deliver our own message
to the whole world.

767
00:57:41,109 --> 00:57:42,763
This is interesting.

768
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:44,548
Baraa?

769
00:57:44,635 --> 00:57:45,766
[speaking Arabic]

770
00:57:49,248 --> 00:57:54,079
It's a pleasure for me
to introduce
one of my best friends,

771
00:57:54,166 --> 00:57:59,563
Mr. Baraa,
he's one of the most activist
people inside Syria.

772
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:02,783
He came a few days ago
'cause he has...

773
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:08,180
He has... many broken
bones on his body.

774
00:58:08,267 --> 00:58:10,704
[gunfire]

775
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:13,838
He was there and covered
the battle in Daraa City.

776
00:58:17,406 --> 00:58:20,279
And in the afternoon,
they get a tank shell.

777
00:58:20,366 --> 00:58:21,585
[explosion]

778
00:58:23,238 --> 00:58:26,807
He was with his friend,
whom has this camera.

779
00:58:28,374 --> 00:58:30,463
And that good guy, you know,
he gets killed

780
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:33,858
by one tank shell
from the regime's side.

781
00:58:33,945 --> 00:58:35,163
[gunfire]

782
00:58:36,861 --> 00:58:38,558
This video, you will see now,

783
00:58:38,645 --> 00:58:42,954
a remote control car and
it exploded, a huge explosion.

784
00:58:44,651 --> 00:58:46,218
It was filmed
by this camera.

785
00:58:48,307 --> 00:58:49,308
[explosion]

786
00:58:50,962 --> 00:58:51,963
After that,

787
00:58:52,050 --> 00:58:54,226
the rocket launchers

788
00:58:54,313 --> 00:58:56,228
started to hit the place
from the regime's side.

789
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:01,233
So our activist, this media guy,

790
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:04,584
he gets killed in here
in this exact... this place.

791
00:59:04,671 --> 00:59:07,413
Now here.
He was standing here.

792
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:10,242
And people found
the camera with him.

793
00:59:10,329 --> 00:59:12,766
We took out the memory card,
and we post this...

794
00:59:14,072 --> 00:59:16,553
as, you know,
in memory of Hussain.

795
00:59:20,295 --> 00:59:22,776
[wreckage clattering]

796
00:59:31,916 --> 00:59:35,963
So now, Mr. Baraa here,
just a few days just to heal.

797
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:40,446
He paid a visit
to some hospitals
to check out himself,

798
00:59:40,533 --> 00:59:44,276
then he will go back into Syria
to keep working.

799
00:59:46,147 --> 00:59:48,802
There is a war on Facebook.

800
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:54,242
Uh, every side is using Facebook
to promote themselves.

801
00:59:54,329 --> 00:59:58,246
They say on Facebook
that the army now controls
a certain area.

802
00:59:58,333 --> 01:00:01,902
So the rebels all go to that
certain area. Even though
it's still rebel-controlled.

803
01:00:01,989 --> 01:00:04,339
They start bombing it, even
though it's under their control.

804
01:00:04,426 --> 01:00:05,819
Then they withdraw from it.

805
01:00:05,906 --> 01:00:09,127
The other way around,
the regime will say,

806
01:00:09,214 --> 01:00:13,087
"We will occupy this area.
We will take over this area."

807
01:00:13,174 --> 01:00:16,177
Then the FSA would leave because
they're afraid of bombardment.

808
01:00:16,264 --> 01:00:17,265
It's just a game.

809
01:00:18,353 --> 01:00:19,616
Facebook is a game.

810
01:00:29,016 --> 01:00:30,409
[Wjd]
It was just a silly joke I made.

811
01:00:31,889 --> 01:00:35,501
I didn't hurt anybody.
I didn't insult anyone.

812
01:00:35,588 --> 01:00:39,548
It was not political.
It was not racist.

813
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:42,464
There is nothing
that they could hold against me

814
01:00:42,551 --> 01:00:44,423
with a thing that
I wrote on Facebook.

815
01:00:46,468 --> 01:00:50,124
But still,
at a time of war...

816
01:00:52,344 --> 01:00:53,432
people get crazy.

817
01:01:02,006 --> 01:01:06,358
They did not drag me
in the street or kidnap me.

818
01:01:06,445 --> 01:01:09,578
They just asked me to come
to ask me a few questions.

819
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,451
This is what they said,
so I signed the paper
that I'm coming.

820
01:01:12,538 --> 01:01:18,631
I went
the next morning at 11:30,
to the detention center.

821
01:01:20,241 --> 01:01:22,243
The security guy came to me.

822
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:25,769
He's like...
He's like half of my height.

823
01:01:25,856 --> 01:01:28,075
He blindfolded me,
and I was like,

824
01:01:28,162 --> 01:01:31,513
I was okay with that
because I thought, it's some...

825
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:37,302
it's confidential secrets
of the country
that they don't want me to see.

826
01:01:37,389 --> 01:01:41,959
And then I was presented
to the detective
or the interrogator.

827
01:01:42,829 --> 01:01:43,787
I never saw him.

828
01:01:46,877 --> 01:01:51,229
He told me,
"You're a computer engineer.
Please be seated."

829
01:01:51,316 --> 01:01:55,929
And I sat next to him
and he started reading
all my Facebook posts.

830
01:01:56,016 --> 01:01:57,017
I was like, "Oh."

831
01:02:08,899 --> 01:02:11,075
One of the posts
that I wrote was,

832
01:02:11,162 --> 01:02:14,165
"No praying, no fasting
until the regime falls,"

833
01:02:14,252 --> 01:02:15,949
which was actually
making fun of both sides.

834
01:02:16,907 --> 01:02:18,299
And I laughed and he's like,

835
01:02:18,386 --> 01:02:21,085
"I'm not kidding with you.
I'm not joking with you."

836
01:02:24,523 --> 01:02:26,786
He kicked me on my chest

837
01:02:26,873 --> 01:02:31,922
and then he requested
the same short guy,

838
01:02:32,009 --> 01:02:33,880
because he was
there in the room,

839
01:02:33,967 --> 01:02:35,839
to bring something called
the "flying carpet,"

840
01:02:35,926 --> 01:02:37,579
which is a torturing machine.

841
01:02:37,666 --> 01:02:42,280
It's a wooden board,
like the door,

842
01:02:42,367 --> 01:02:45,413
but it has joints in the middle
that can flip.

843
01:02:46,327 --> 01:02:50,462
And I had to lay on it.

844
01:02:50,549 --> 01:02:54,858
They tied my wrists and
they tied me from the middle,
they tied my legs.

845
01:02:54,945 --> 01:02:59,601
And they just closed it
so my knees touched my chest.

846
01:02:59,688 --> 01:03:01,995
He took off my shoes
and my socks

847
01:03:02,082 --> 01:03:07,566
and started beating me
with a metal,
uh, with a metal whip.

848
01:03:10,134 --> 01:03:14,051
The pain is unbelievable.

849
01:03:15,139 --> 01:03:16,662
You just can't take it anymore.

850
01:03:16,749 --> 01:03:20,709
You just can't endure
this amount of agony.

851
01:03:29,240 --> 01:03:32,591
What we saw in Syria
was a lot of use of, say,

852
01:03:32,678 --> 01:03:34,898
off-the-shelf remote access
tools.

853
01:03:34,985 --> 01:03:38,466
So this is sort of software
that you can get from
underground message boards

854
01:03:38,553 --> 01:03:40,947
or maybe purchased
for not so much money.

855
01:03:41,034 --> 01:03:44,995
Maybe $200-300 that
give you the ability

856
01:03:45,082 --> 01:03:47,911
to record someone's keystrokes,
read their e-mails,

857
01:03:47,998 --> 01:03:51,131
even look at them
through their webcam.

858
01:03:51,218 --> 01:03:53,699
Record via
the computer's microphone,

859
01:03:53,786 --> 01:03:56,528
conversations that are being had
around the target's computer.

860
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,227
Frequently what you would see

861
01:04:00,314 --> 01:04:03,013
is it would be bundled
with some type of lured document

862
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:07,321
which showed
a deep understanding

863
01:04:07,408 --> 01:04:10,150
of the psychology of the people
they were trying to target.

864
01:04:10,237 --> 01:04:15,025
For instance, one of
the documents that was sent out
that I keenly recall

865
01:04:15,112 --> 01:04:17,462
was a list.

866
01:04:17,549 --> 01:04:23,468
A purported list
of insurgents identified
by the Syrian government.

867
01:04:23,555 --> 01:04:28,429
So of course what happened was
that this was promptly passed
around

868
01:04:28,516 --> 01:04:31,606
to all sorts of very
interesting groups in Syria

869
01:04:31,693 --> 01:04:34,609
because everyone wanted to know
if they were on this list
or not.

870
01:04:34,696 --> 01:04:40,311
So the actual spyware
payload itself wasn't
particularly sophisticated

871
01:04:40,398 --> 01:04:43,444
but the social...

872
01:04:43,531 --> 01:04:46,752
the social
and social engineering side
of that operation,

873
01:04:46,839 --> 01:04:48,885
um, was quite smart.

874
01:04:55,326 --> 01:04:58,851
Internet entered almost
all countries in the region

875
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,245
before it entered Syria.

876
01:05:02,507 --> 01:05:03,464
Yes.

877
01:05:03,551 --> 01:05:05,902
Government in Syria,

878
01:05:05,989 --> 01:05:08,252
we are not as developed
as Canada, for example,

879
01:05:08,339 --> 01:05:10,341
or not as developed
as United States.

880
01:05:10,428 --> 01:05:13,431
In Canada
they can monitor people
and control people

881
01:05:13,518 --> 01:05:16,260
and spy people in
a very intelligent way.

882
01:05:16,347 --> 01:05:18,871
And even they don't
feel that they are...

883
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:23,093
spied on.

884
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:27,924
But in Syria,
of course you go to old ways.

885
01:05:34,669 --> 01:05:37,455
They untie me and then I was...

886
01:05:37,542 --> 01:05:40,153
and then he asked me to
sit next to him, and he said,

887
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:41,198
"Let's start talking."

888
01:05:43,156 --> 01:05:46,551
And I told him,
"I don't want to
talk to you anymore."

889
01:05:46,638 --> 01:05:52,949
He said, "I want you
to admit you work with the Free
Syrian Electronic Army."

890
01:05:53,036 --> 01:05:55,516
I was like,
"I don't know what that is."

891
01:05:55,603 --> 01:05:58,911
He said, "You like their page.
You like their page
on Facebook."

892
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:02,219
I told him,
"I like their page on Facebook,

893
01:06:02,306 --> 01:06:05,309
but there are too many pages
on Facebook that you can like.

894
01:06:05,396 --> 01:06:07,920
I also like Assad's page
on Facebook."

895
01:06:09,530 --> 01:06:12,011
Well, that did not convince him.

896
01:06:12,098 --> 01:06:17,190
So his boss came
and he told him,
"What is going on?"

897
01:06:17,277 --> 01:06:21,586
He told him,
"This is the Facebook guy,
and he's not cooperating."

898
01:06:21,673 --> 01:06:25,938
So then his boss told him to,
"Send him down to the basement,

899
01:06:26,025 --> 01:06:29,942
peel his skin off and just
remind me of him after a month."

900
01:06:30,029 --> 01:06:32,466
And I was like, "Can we go
back to the flying carpet?"

901

[chuckles]

902
01:06:36,035 --> 01:06:37,819
I stayed there
for almost a month,

903
01:06:37,906 --> 01:06:41,301
and then I was released
with a presidential amnesty.

904
01:06:43,477 --> 01:06:46,263
So I went in a taxi,

905
01:06:46,350 --> 01:06:50,441

dirt, shit and blood,

906
01:06:50,528 --> 01:06:53,966

my clothes.

907
01:06:54,053 --> 01:06:58,144
And then the taxi driver
felt pity for me,
and he gave me a cigarette.

908
01:06:58,231 --> 01:07:00,233
I remember
that was the first time I cried.

909
01:07:03,497 --> 01:07:07,501
And I went to my flat in Latakia
where I used to study,

910
01:07:07,588 --> 01:07:09,373
and my roommates
were shocked
to see me alive.

911
01:07:11,244 --> 01:07:15,118
And then, like,
two weeks after that
I fled the country.

918

than the kinds of risks

919
01:07:49,587 --> 01:07:51,806
um, although they look
different.

920
01:07:51,893 --> 01:07:53,199

921
01:07:53,286 --> 01:07:56,855

It's the same problem,

it looks very different

924
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:04,776

dark skinned people,

925
01:08:04,863 --> 01:08:07,431
uh, and there are guns
and a foreign language,

926
01:08:07,518 --> 01:08:10,434

exotic and different,

927
01:08:10,521 --> 01:08:12,044
and it couldn't happen here.

928
01:08:12,131 --> 01:08:14,568
And I think, in fact,
what you're seeing in Syria

929
01:08:14,655 --> 01:08:17,571
is this is what happens
when the risks get higher

930

01:13:40,024 --> 01:13:42,418
And suddenly there was,
like, a small crowd.

1010
01:13:42,505 --> 01:13:44,637
Like 5,000 people.

1011
01:13:44,724 --> 01:13:47,814
And all of them was
screaming together,

1012
01:13:47,901 --> 01:13:51,209
[in Portuguese]
"Hey, police,
where is the Midia Ninja?"

1013
01:13:51,296 --> 01:13:57,084
[chanting] Hey, police,
where is the Midia Ninja?

1014
01:13:57,171 --> 01:13:59,260
At the police station,

1015
01:13:59,347 --> 01:14:04,875
there were some lawyers
to help us, some activists.

1016
01:14:04,962 --> 01:14:06,442
That's where I met Bruno Teles.

1017
01:14:07,660 --> 01:14:09,053
[man speaking in Portuguese]

1018
01:14:11,751 --> 01:14:13,536
[woman speaking Portuguese]

1019
01:14:13,623 --> 01:14:16,321
-What's your name?
-My name is
Bruno Ferreira Teles.

1020
01:14:16,408 --> 01:14:20,194
[Teles]
The Midia Ninjas appeared
right when I needed to speak.

1021
01:14:20,281 --> 01:14:22,501
They gave me a voice.
They asked me if I wanted
to give them an interview.

1022
01:14:22,588 --> 01:14:25,722
I said I want to. I need to!

1023
01:14:25,809 --> 01:14:28,638
As we interviewed Bruno,

1024
01:14:28,725 --> 01:14:33,164
Globo broadcast that
he threw the Molotov

1025
01:14:33,251 --> 01:14:37,777
and had been arrested.

1026
01:14:37,864 --> 01:14:42,869
It was Bruno Ferreira
who was caught with a backpack
full of Molotov cocktails.

1027
01:14:42,956 --> 01:14:44,871
The police officer who was hit
with the Molotov cocktail

1028
01:14:44,958 --> 01:14:47,439
suffered burns to the thorax.

1029
01:14:50,355 --> 01:14:55,316
The big media in general
were all against me.

1030
01:14:55,403 --> 01:14:58,494
They associated me
with vandalism,
with violence.

1031
01:14:58,581 --> 01:14:59,973
[shouting]

1032
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:04,282
I want to ask you
to help me to find the video

1033
01:15:04,369 --> 01:15:07,154
of the moment
where I ran from police.

1034
01:15:07,894 --> 01:15:10,331
They took me in,

1035
01:15:10,418 --> 01:15:12,986
and they are saying
I was there with bottles
of Molotov cocktails,

1036
01:15:13,073 --> 01:15:14,901
and I was not.

1037
01:15:14,988 --> 01:15:18,601
That's all I'm asking,
that you search out these videos
and collaborate.

1038
01:15:18,688 --> 01:15:21,734
[Silva, in English]
Then we posted this video from
the mobile, like, real time,

1039
01:15:21,821 --> 01:15:23,606
and it virilized very fast.

1040
01:15:28,132 --> 01:15:30,569
[Carioca, in Portuguese]
Our in-box exploded.

1041
01:15:30,656 --> 01:15:33,441
5,000 e-mails in 24 hours.

1042
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:36,532
A ton of images and video

1043
01:15:36,619 --> 01:15:40,448
that showed Bruno's innocence.

1044
01:16:09,477 --> 01:16:10,348
[glass shattering]

1045
01:16:14,265 --> 01:16:16,354
[vocalizing]

1046
01:16:17,877 --> 01:16:19,531
[video sound distorted]

1047
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:31,412
[vocalizing continues]

1048
01:16:34,764 --> 01:16:35,591
[glass shattering]

1049
01:17:02,922 --> 01:17:05,185
[woman] What is this, people?
This is surreal.

1050
01:17:05,925 --> 01:17:10,713
[woman vocalizing]

1051
01:17:20,113 --> 01:17:22,289
[vocalizing]

1052
01:17:25,379 --> 01:17:26,859
[shouting]

1053
01:17:38,392 --> 01:17:40,612
[music distorting]

1054
01:17:49,273 --> 01:17:50,666
[gunshot muffled]

1055
01:17:55,061 --> 01:17:56,584
[electrical crackling]

1056
01:18:04,201 --> 01:18:05,376
[crackling continues]

1057
01:18:16,822 --> 01:18:20,043
The video was just getting
bigger in the social media.

1058
01:18:20,130 --> 01:18:22,001
Bruno Teles became a character.

1059
01:18:22,088 --> 01:18:24,047
[crowd shouting]

1060
01:18:26,353 --> 01:18:31,707
Within a day,
Globo reversed their position.

1061
01:18:31,794 --> 01:18:35,145
They said I was a student,
a good kid.

1062
01:18:36,015 --> 01:18:40,150
Everyone likes him.

1063
01:18:40,237 --> 01:18:46,069
Contrary to information
released by the military
and civil police,

1064
01:18:46,156 --> 01:18:51,074
the student Bruno Teles
did not possess explosives
at the time of his arrest.

1065
01:18:51,161 --> 01:18:53,554
[Silva] They said
that Bruno was innocent,

1066
01:18:53,641 --> 01:18:58,168
and they used Midia Ninja image.

1067
01:18:58,255 --> 01:19:00,474
And they credited Midia Ninja.

1068
01:19:00,561 --> 01:19:03,913
It was the first
time that we were seeing

1069
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,395
Globo recognizing
a free media collective

1070
01:19:08,482 --> 01:19:12,922
as a legitimate player
in the communication game.

1071
01:19:13,009 --> 01:19:15,707
It was a next step.

1072
01:19:17,361 --> 01:19:19,363
[crowd shouting]

1073
01:19:22,322 --> 01:19:23,410
[gunshot]

1074
01:19:28,546 --> 01:19:30,026
[explosion]

1075
01:19:42,038 --> 01:19:43,082
[glass shattering]

1076
01:19:46,738 --> 01:19:52,135
[woman]
Oh, he's changing his shirt.

1077
01:19:56,052 --> 01:19:57,575
[shouting]

1078
01:20:00,404 --> 01:20:03,407
[woman vocalizing]

1079
01:20:12,851 --> 01:20:15,854
[Orlando]
This is an old strategy.

1080
01:20:15,941 --> 01:20:20,816
When police infiltrate groups
and appear as activists,

1081
01:20:20,903 --> 01:20:23,819
they legitimize
the police violence.

1082
01:20:27,866 --> 01:20:29,563
[explosion]

1083
01:20:29,650 --> 01:20:33,524
For the population,
if the protestors
are launching explosions,

1084
01:20:33,611 --> 01:20:37,354
the police must do
whatever is necessary,
even on the margins of the law.

1085
01:20:37,441 --> 01:20:40,618
[Bentes]
The best form of security today

1086
01:20:40,705 --> 01:20:44,491
is to live stream everything.

1087
01:20:44,578 --> 01:20:49,235
If everyone knows where you are,
then you're safe.

1088
01:20:49,322 --> 01:20:54,893
The French word "surveillance"
implies watching from above.

1089
01:20:54,980 --> 01:20:57,722
In this case "sub-veillance"
is more accurate.

1090
01:20:57,809 --> 01:21:03,859
Bottom-up. The crowd
surveils from all angles.

1091
01:21:03,946 --> 01:21:09,299
[crowd chanting in Portuguese]
Hey, undercover cops,
go fuck yourself!

1092
01:21:12,345 --> 01:21:16,349
Are you an undercover cop?I'm a protestor, idiot!

1093
01:21:18,525 --> 01:21:20,788
[shouting continues]

1094
01:21:22,007 --> 01:21:23,226
[crowd booing]

1095
01:21:26,969 --> 01:21:33,540
It took only
the time for the video
to circulate online and on TV,

1096
01:21:33,627 --> 01:21:36,500
then habeas corpus was filed,
and he was released.

1097
01:21:37,457 --> 01:21:39,546
[woman] Bruno! Come here!

1098
01:21:42,462 --> 01:21:43,681
[woman crying]

1099
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:56,607
[Orlando]
What if we didn't have
these images?

1100
01:21:56,694 --> 01:21:59,392
[shouting]

1101
01:21:59,479 --> 01:22:03,875
How many others
don't have the good fortune
of being filmed?

1102
01:22:05,485 --> 01:22:10,621
[crowd chanting]
Ninja! Ninja! Ninja!

1103
01:22:10,708 --> 01:22:12,928
Ten people are still inside,
some of them Ninjas.

1104
01:22:13,015 --> 01:22:17,715
[crowd repeating]

1105
01:22:17,802 --> 01:22:19,673
And we will not leave...

1106
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:22,546
[crowd repeating]

1107
01:22:22,633 --> 01:22:24,852
...until they are all released.

1108
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,767
[cheering]

1109
01:22:29,596 --> 01:22:30,510
[crowd] Ninja!

1110
01:22:33,557 --> 01:22:37,604
[crowd chanting]

1111
01:22:44,307 --> 01:22:47,440
[digital pop music playing]

1112
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:03,152
I've always been a fan
of the terms "hacking"
and "hacktivism."

1113
01:23:03,239 --> 01:23:04,718
Especially "hacktivism"

1114
01:23:04,805 --> 01:23:08,200
which is the combination of
hacking and political activism.

1115
01:23:08,287 --> 01:23:13,031
And those combined
are pretty powerful to me.

1116
01:23:13,118 --> 01:23:17,775
It's about encouraging people
not to accept technology
at face value.

1117
01:23:19,255 --> 01:23:20,996
We need to encourage people
to think about

1118
01:23:21,083 --> 01:23:23,911
what it is that surrounds them,

1119
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:26,305
to question authority

1120
01:23:26,392 --> 01:23:30,527
in a sense of the authority
being the technological
environment around them

1121
01:23:30,614 --> 01:23:35,967
and to realize that
when you start pulling back
the layers of all of this,

1122
01:23:36,054 --> 01:23:38,230
that's where
the exercise of power is.

1123
01:23:38,317 --> 01:23:41,538
So if we want liberal democracy
to flourish,

1124
01:23:41,625 --> 01:23:44,541
we need people
to start lifting back the layers

1125
01:23:44,628 --> 01:23:46,021
and understanding
what's going on.

1126
01:23:55,117 --> 01:23:58,946
[clicking]

1127
01:24:01,688 --> 01:24:05,562
[Snowden] I think ultimately
it comes down to understanding
what your values are,

1128
01:24:05,649 --> 01:24:08,173
because how do you
develop your thoughts, right?

1129
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:10,262
How do you determine
what it is that
you truly believe?

1130
01:24:10,349 --> 01:24:13,700
How do you determine what
it is you really want to say,

1131
01:24:13,787 --> 01:24:15,833
if you can't even
keep notes safely?

1132
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:19,924
If you can't
have some private space,
some space for thought,

1133
01:24:20,011 --> 01:24:22,753
some space to enjoy the product
of your own intellect,

1134
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:25,277
to share that with people
close to you who you trust.

1135
01:24:25,364 --> 01:24:28,063
Whether they're family,
whether they're colleagues,
whether they're compatriots.

1136
01:24:37,159 --> 01:24:42,512
[Deibert] One thing
that I see a lot is, this idea
of technology as a solution.

1137
01:24:42,599 --> 01:24:45,123
It's a natural thing.
Okay, technology
is under threat.

1138
01:24:45,210 --> 01:24:47,082
Let's find
a technological solution.

1139
01:24:48,605 --> 01:24:50,302
There are so many projects now

1140
01:24:50,389 --> 01:24:54,219
around secure communications,
platforms, chats,
instant messaging.

1141
01:24:54,306 --> 01:24:58,354
But it's only one component
of a solution set.

1142
01:24:58,441 --> 01:25:02,401
And I think often overlooked
are the legal and political
dimensions.

1143
01:25:03,620 --> 01:25:04,708
If we're talking about

1144
01:25:04,795 --> 01:25:06,884
protecting and preserving
all of this,

1145
01:25:06,971 --> 01:25:10,931
as a secure and open
communication space,

1146
01:25:11,018 --> 01:25:12,846
that means holding governments
accountable.

1147
01:25:12,933 --> 01:25:14,892
It means holding
companies accountable.

1148
01:25:14,979 --> 01:25:17,416
Putting in place rules and laws

1149
01:25:17,503 --> 01:25:22,465
that ensures they can't
do things that infringe
on our freedoms and rights.

1150
01:25:22,552 --> 01:25:25,642
That to me is, uh,

1151
01:25:25,729 --> 01:25:29,733
such a critical foundation
of a digital democracy today.
