2
00:02:22,816 --> 00:02:24,022
Don't just stand there, do something!

3
00:02:24,022 --> 00:02:25,021
Wait.

4
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:46,667
Hold still!

5
00:02:46,668 --> 00:02:47,997
Stop moving! Hear me?

6
00:02:48,582 --> 00:02:49,955
Did she drive? Where's her key?

7
00:02:51,287 --> 00:02:52,286
Split.

8
00:02:52,867 --> 00:02:53,866
What are you doing?

9
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,199
Wait.

10
00:02:59,236 --> 00:03:00,278
You've got nerves.

11
00:03:01,152 --> 00:03:02,232
You've got nerves.

12
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:03,315
Hurry up! Let's go!

13
00:03:03,317 --> 00:03:04,191
You've got nerves.

14
00:03:04,191 --> 00:03:04,898
Let's go!

15
00:03:04,898 --> 00:03:05,897
Let's go! Xiao Bo.

16
00:03:06,104 --> 00:03:07,103
Let's go!

17
00:03:12,183 --> 00:03:13,637
We agreed only to trash the house.

18
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,136
Why did you nick her stuff?

19
00:03:15,138 --> 00:03:16,886
Aren't you driving her car?

20
00:03:17,178 --> 00:03:19,090
If I hadn't, we'd be in jail by now.

21
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:20,713
Can you stop dragging us along

22
00:03:20,714 --> 00:03:22,130
to this kind of small-time rackets?

23
00:03:22,422 --> 00:03:23,711
I thought we did it for Xiao Bo.

24
00:03:24,128 --> 00:03:25,326
Look at the mess we're in now.

25
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:26,708
And you, Xiao Bo.

26
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:28,247
You're supposed to be on the lookout.

27
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,665
Why did you tie her up?

28
00:03:30,204 --> 00:03:31,203
Answer me.

29
00:03:31,663 --> 00:03:32,662
Sorry.

30
00:03:33,576 --> 00:03:35,284
<i>With the approach of the chime,</i>

31
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:37,238
<i>we eagerly and fondly await,</i>

32
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,862
<i>the arrival of the new year.</i>

33
00:03:40,362 --> 00:03:41,777
<i>As we bid 2017 farewell,</i>

34
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,565
<i>let us wish our family,</i>

35
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:44,605
<i>our mentors,</i>

36
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:45,812
<i>our friends,</i>

37
00:03:45,813 --> 00:03:47,811
<i>and all our listeners a happy new year!</i>

38
00:03:54,472 --> 00:03:55,471
What happened?

39
00:03:56,427 --> 00:03:57,426
Out of gas.

40
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:00,298
Get out.

41
00:04:01,422 --> 00:04:02,421
Where are we?

42
00:05:30,624 --> 00:05:31,623
Where should we go?

43
00:05:33,537 --> 00:05:34,745
That place looks abandoned.

44
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,799
It's vacant.

45
00:06:07,711 --> 00:06:08,668
Watch your hands!

46
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:10,042
Move over.

47
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:11,457
It's opened.

48
00:06:25,109 --> 00:06:26,108
Anyone here?

49
00:06:46,088 --> 00:06:47,170
Chiming on the hour.

50
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:48,045
You're such a wimp.

51
00:06:48,045 --> 00:06:49,044
You jumped.

52
00:06:53,123 --> 00:06:54,122
Happy new year!

53
00:06:55,662 --> 00:06:56,369
Happy new year!

54
00:06:56,369 --> 00:06:57,368
Happy my ass!

55
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:58,950
Let's quickly look around.

56
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:06,901
Check this out!

57
00:07:06,901 --> 00:07:10,063
31 December 1993.

58
00:07:10,772 --> 00:07:11,811
We weren't even born.

59
00:07:11,812 --> 00:07:13,060
This place is ancient!

60
00:07:15,183 --> 00:07:16,349
The battery is dead.

61
00:07:20,012 --> 00:07:21,261
Where should we go tomorrow?

62
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,759
Out of town.

63
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:24,798
Let's talk in the morning.

64
00:07:25,215 --> 00:07:26,214
I don't want to go.

65
00:07:26,671 --> 00:07:27,670
Me neither.

66
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,502
Are you out of your mind?

67
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:32,208
Want to go to jail?

68
00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:33,289
We did nothing to deserve jail.

69
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,372
Not initially.

70
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:35,829
Not until you guys

71
00:07:36,786 --> 00:07:37,785
committed burglary

72
00:07:38,244 --> 00:07:39,367
and tied someone up.

73
00:07:53,769 --> 00:07:54,810
Namiya General Store.

74
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:56,974
Small Town Musician.

75
00:07:59,763 --> 00:08:00,762
Stay here.

76
00:08:06,298 --> 00:08:07,963
Not sure if you're still in business.

77
00:08:08,213 --> 00:08:09,919
Please excuse my impudence.

78
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:12,666
My dream is to make good music.

79
00:08:15,372 --> 00:08:16,371
A musician!

80
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:24,196
Friends I once jammed with at bars

81
00:08:24,197 --> 00:08:25,985
have released albums and headlined gigs.

82
00:08:25,986 --> 00:08:27,276
But I am still a nobody.

83
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,807
I am my family's only son.

84
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,555
Dad has just been taken ill.

85
00:08:39,556 --> 00:08:40,555
So I came home.

86
00:08:40,847 --> 00:08:42,259
In fact, dad will soon retire.

87
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,551
He has arranged for me to take his job.

88
00:08:44,967 --> 00:08:46,923
But I'm not giving up on my dreams.

89
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,670
I don't know who else to talk to.

90
00:08:50,045 --> 00:08:51,750
If you happen to read this letter,

91
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,041
I hope to get your advice.

92
00:09:23,343 --> 00:09:24,342
What?

93
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,048
A corner store with no name,

94
00:09:28,338 --> 00:09:31,003
dubbed the Namiya store by the locals.

95
00:09:31,295 --> 00:09:33,293
One can seek counseling there

96
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:36,415
by dropping off questions
at the front door.

97
00:09:36,747 --> 00:09:38,786
Replies will be posted on
the wall the next day.

98
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,201
If the question is personal

99
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,948
the reply is put in a
milk box at the back.

100
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,569
This is 1993.

101
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:49,359
The no name corner store is Namiya.

102
00:09:51,108 --> 00:09:52,356
I... Yes, I know.

103
00:09:52,688 --> 00:09:53,811
Must be an old letter, you know

104
00:09:53,812 --> 00:09:54,978
it got stuck and just fell down now.

105
00:09:54,979 --> 00:09:55,853
But this looks brand new

106
00:09:55,853 --> 00:09:56,852
no smudges or stains.

107
00:09:56,852 --> 00:09:58,182
How can it be old?

108
00:09:58,475 --> 00:09:59,598
Maybe this guy

109
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,389
didn't know the store was closed.

110
00:10:01,722 --> 00:10:03,095
So he writes in,

111
00:10:03,512 --> 00:10:05,299
hoping to get advice.

112
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,049
Bro!

113
00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:06,884
What era are we living in?

114
00:10:06,885 --> 00:10:08,090
Who would still write letters?

115
00:10:08,964 --> 00:10:09,880
Stop this nonsense.

116
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,545
Go to sleep.

117
00:10:10,546 --> 00:10:11,712
We leave at first light.

118
00:10:17,705 --> 00:10:18,287
Well?

119
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:21,534
Will that musician give up his dream?

120
00:10:22,283 --> 00:10:23,282
I don't know.

121
00:10:24,074 --> 00:10:25,155
But to give up

122
00:10:25,572 --> 00:10:26,738
is as hard as to carry on.

123
00:10:29,443 --> 00:10:30,733
If you were him,

124
00:10:30,734 --> 00:10:31,858
how would you choose?

125
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,018
I have nothing to linger on

126
00:10:38,476 --> 00:10:39,725
and nothing to let go of.

127
00:10:42,512 --> 00:10:44,385
Wanna write a reply for the store?

128
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:45,594
Why not?

129
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:47,717
What's wrong with you two?

130
00:10:48,131 --> 00:10:48,631
Paper.

131
00:10:48,632 --> 00:10:50,628
Now that we've read his letter,

132
00:10:50,629 --> 00:10:52,126
we might as well give him a reply.

133
00:10:52,127 --> 00:10:53,543
Stop this bullshit!

134
00:10:53,544 --> 00:10:55,209
Have you thought about getting caught?

135
00:10:55,499 --> 00:10:57,497
Since he won't come for
it until tomorrow,

136
00:10:57,996 --> 00:10:59,329
we'll be gone by then.

137
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,329
I'd say,

138
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:01,536
my dear buddies,

139
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:03,491
take a good look at yourselves.

140
00:11:04,408 --> 00:11:05,727
Know what kind of mess we are in?

141
00:11:06,737 --> 00:11:08,859
Can you listen to me for once?

142
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,485
Fine.

143
00:11:09,777 --> 00:11:10,776
Okay.

144
00:11:11,692 --> 00:11:12,691
Write.

145
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,063
Your dad wants you to take over,

146
00:11:15,064 --> 00:11:16,394
so to hell with your music career.

147
00:11:16,395 --> 00:11:18,349
Or you could live stream your singalongs,

148
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,099
and hope you hit it big
as an internet celeb!

149
00:11:30,588 --> 00:11:31,255
Well?

150
00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:32,254
Happy now?

151
00:11:32,254 --> 00:11:33,377
Where did you leave the letter?

152
00:11:33,378 --> 00:11:34,294
Milk box at the back,

153
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:35,543
just like the papers say.

154
00:11:36,082 --> 00:11:37,081
Not this one, right?

155
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,448
He doesn't know what internet celeb
or live stream means.

156
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:45,448
Never heard of them.

157
00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:47,070
It's been barely a minute.

158
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,944
How did he manage to reply?

159
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:50,528
It's a few days.

160
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,109
What do you mean?

161
00:11:52,234 --> 00:11:53,358
He said it in his letter.

162
00:11:53,857 --> 00:11:55,734
"I thought it over for
days before replying..."

163
00:11:56,646 --> 00:11:57,560
I'm telling you,

164
00:11:57,561 --> 00:12:00,017
I sense bad vibes the
minute I set foot here.

165
00:12:00,018 --> 00:12:01,017
No!

166
00:12:01,641 --> 00:12:02,224
We'd better leave.

167
00:12:02,224 --> 00:12:02,848
Let's go.

168
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:03,847
Hang on.

169
00:12:04,303 --> 00:12:05,096
Now what?

170
00:12:05,096 --> 00:12:05,805
I have an idea.

171
00:12:05,845 --> 00:12:07,050
Xiao Bo, you write to explain

172
00:12:07,051 --> 00:12:08,842
about the internet and live streaming.

173
00:12:15,042 --> 00:12:16,041
Here.

174
00:12:23,908 --> 00:12:24,950
Xiao Bo,

175
00:12:25,282 --> 00:12:26,281
Xiao Bo,

176
00:12:26,823 --> 00:12:27,822
why did you come out?

177
00:12:27,822 --> 00:12:28,821
Get back in!

178
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:37,853
So nobody came to the back.

179
00:12:37,854 --> 00:12:39,476
But the letter in the milk box is gone.

180
00:12:39,477 --> 00:12:40,725
Nobody came to the front either.

181
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:41,141
Right.

182
00:12:41,515 --> 00:12:43,098
Still the third letter arrived.

183
00:12:43,099 --> 00:12:44,722
He doesn't know what a cell phone is.

184
00:12:45,262 --> 00:12:46,845
I can't stay anymore. Let's go.

185
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,503
We have to find out what is going on.

186
00:12:56,668 --> 00:12:57,667
Let's go.

187
00:12:58,708 --> 00:12:59,707
Go!

188
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,287
He sent us a letter.

189
00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:04,309
I want to give a reply to help him.

190
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:04,867
Fine.

191
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:05,576
Have fun.

192
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:06,825
I am leaving.

193
00:14:00,894 --> 00:14:01,893
Hungry?

194
00:14:02,892 --> 00:14:04,265
I thought you'd left for good

195
00:14:04,266 --> 00:14:04,973
I knew it.

196
00:14:04,973 --> 00:14:06,512
I can't leave you alone for a minute.

197
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:07,346
What are you talking about?

198
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,635
You were gone for nearly two hours.

199
00:14:08,636 --> 00:14:10,092
Xiao Bo almost passed out with hunger.

200
00:14:10,093 --> 00:14:11,965
I just saw an announcement posted online,

201
00:14:11,966 --> 00:14:13,165
saying that this general store

202
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:15,419
will revive for one night tonight

203
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:17,501
from midnight until sunrise.

204
00:14:17,502 --> 00:14:19,749
Anyone who has received advice before

205
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,582
can again...

206
00:14:20,582 --> 00:14:21,581
write to the store-owner.

207
00:14:24,953 --> 00:14:25,952
Xiao Bo, what is it?

208
00:14:26,743 --> 00:14:27,200
What's the matter?

209
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,574
Oh my god...

210
00:14:28,824 --> 00:14:29,573
He is choking.

211
00:14:29,573 --> 00:14:30,572
Hold still.

212
00:14:31,446 --> 00:14:32,611
Stop making me worried.

213
00:14:32,612 --> 00:14:33,931
No one is stealing your biscuits.

214
00:14:34,275 --> 00:14:35,274
What's the matter?

215
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:35,941
What is it?

216
00:14:36,316 --> 00:14:37,315
The shadow.

217
00:14:37,482 --> 00:14:39,062
I measured it when I first got here.

218
00:14:39,063 --> 00:14:40,187
It's been a while

219
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:41,478
since we came inside.

220
00:14:42,017 --> 00:14:44,183
The shadow should have gotten longer.

221
00:14:44,515 --> 00:14:46,262
No, I only went out for a moment.

222
00:14:46,263 --> 00:14:47,012
Didn't I?

223
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:48,552
I checked my phone when I left.

224
00:14:48,553 --> 00:14:49,509
It was just past midnight.

225
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:50,669
I even thought it was broken.

226
00:14:50,843 --> 00:14:51,842
Impossible.

227
00:14:52,132 --> 00:14:53,423
You were gone for a lot longer.

228
00:14:54,005 --> 00:14:55,004
Time runs slower.

229
00:14:55,878 --> 00:14:57,794
You said you saw an online post,

230
00:14:58,044 --> 00:14:59,748
announcing the store's
revival for a night.

231
00:14:59,749 --> 00:15:00,124
Yes.

232
00:15:00,124 --> 00:15:00,791
But when I left here,

233
00:15:00,791 --> 00:15:02,288
I didn't see anybody.

234
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:04,120
But didn't we get the musician's reply?

235
00:15:05,119 --> 00:15:06,118
Maybe...

236
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:08,740
This place is haunted!

237
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:10,447
In order to answer your questions,

238
00:15:10,448 --> 00:15:12,904
I'd like to know more about you.

239
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:20,728
Try closing the door.

240
00:15:23,268 --> 00:15:24,559
One, two, three.

241
00:15:34,963 --> 00:15:36,670
This man uses a pager

242
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:39,209
watches the drama
"The Legend of White Snake."

243
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:41,624
"What is smog?"

244
00:15:41,831 --> 00:15:43,539
He doesn't know what smog is.

245
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:46,826
Beijing is bidding to
host the 2000 Olympics.

246
00:15:47,993 --> 00:15:51,032
Can this man be actually from the 90s?

247
00:15:52,238 --> 00:15:53,818
We just found out

248
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,067
by closing the back door

249
00:15:55,442 --> 00:15:58,357
the letter in the milk
box will disappear.

250
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,021
So I think

251
00:16:01,271 --> 00:16:02,934
the back door is an on-off switch.

252
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:04,226
What switch?

253
00:16:04,393 --> 00:16:05,517
To access the time portal.

254
00:16:06,431 --> 00:16:07,223
Right.

255
00:16:07,223 --> 00:16:08,472
The portal is right here.

256
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:10,470
Xiao Bo, let's write back

257
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:11,426
to encourage him

258
00:16:11,427 --> 00:16:12,842
to hold on to his dreams.

259
00:16:13,174 --> 00:16:14,466
Stop this nonsense.

260
00:16:15,547 --> 00:16:17,380
Let's say he's from the 90s.

261
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:18,877
He never made big-time.

262
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:20,041
During all these years from around here,

263
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:21,208
only Zhang Wei Wei made
a name for herself.

264
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:22,208
And she is a girl.

265
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,705
Is only outcome that matters?

266
00:16:23,706 --> 00:16:25,786
Wouldn't it be great if
he pursued his dreams?

267
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:28,279
You can sit around twiddling your thumbs.
Who are you to judge anyone?

268
00:16:29,617 --> 00:16:30,780
Sure. Write him back.

269
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:31,780
I won't stop you.

270
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,488
But can he make a living with music?

271
00:17:13,363 --> 00:17:15,778
<i>Greetings, Namiya Store.</i>

272
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,338
<i>Not sure if you're still in business.</i>

273
00:17:19,066 --> 00:17:20,439
<i>Please excuse my impudence.</i>

274
00:17:21,813 --> 00:17:23,770
<i>My dream is to make good music.</i>

275
00:17:24,602 --> 00:17:26,517
<i>For three years,
I fought hard in Beijing.</i>

276
00:17:38,795 --> 00:17:41,085
I stayed up all night.

277
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:43,874
To write you a passionate poem.

278
00:17:46,122 --> 00:17:49,285
I see autumn like songbirds

279
00:17:50,825 --> 00:17:52,823
perching disorderly on poplar.

280
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,402
The red crow on your body squeals

281
00:17:57,236 --> 00:17:58,984
breathing tenderly.

282
00:17:59,524 --> 00:18:01,563
<i>I can see an arrogant knight</i>

283
00:18:01,564 --> 00:18:03,729
riding out from a white castle,

284
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:09,681
as love reaches the emerald sea.

285
00:18:11,012 --> 00:18:13,177
I can see the succulent ginkgos

286
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:15,467
dangling from her shoulders

287
00:18:16,091 --> 00:18:17,797
with breath as a breeze.

288
00:18:18,879 --> 00:18:21,669
With cherries like the eyes of pigeons...

289
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,289
Let your voice shiver more!

290
00:18:26,871 --> 00:18:28,162
Sound more desperate!

291
00:18:28,911 --> 00:18:30,034
You should know

292
00:18:30,035 --> 00:18:31,783
this is a weird sensation.

293
00:18:32,949 --> 00:18:35,113
Don't look at her. Look at the sky.

294
00:18:40,316 --> 00:18:41,815
What are you drawing?

295
00:18:42,065 --> 00:18:43,563
How many times have you started over?

296
00:18:46,601 --> 00:18:48,516
Where is your hometown?

297
00:19:05,915 --> 00:19:06,872
Can you hear me?

298
00:19:06,872 --> 00:19:07,788
Get ready.

299
00:19:07,788 --> 00:19:08,787
Go.

300
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,199
<i>The flower of youth blossoms and withers.</i>

301
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,114
<i>Tiring me out but I have no regrets.</i>

302
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:19,359
The rain and snow of four
seasons flutter in the air.

303
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,315
<i>Fascinating me but I pine away.</i>

304
00:19:23,023 --> 00:19:26,269
<i>The soft wind and the supple dream</i>

305
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:29,141
<i>are dazedly gentle.</i>

306
00:19:29,142 --> 00:19:30,640
<i>Stop!</i>

307
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:31,597
Look!

308
00:19:31,598 --> 00:19:32,887
For someone who's so out of touch,

309
00:19:32,888 --> 00:19:34,677
you should try rock 'n' roll...

310
00:19:35,051 --> 00:19:37,299
that might work better.

311
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:41,003
C'mon, show me.

312
00:19:41,004 --> 00:19:42,252
Sing with anger!

313
00:19:42,253 --> 00:19:45,291
Free that rage from your heart!

314
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:46,124
Go.

315
00:19:46,582 --> 00:19:47,081
Get ready.

316
00:19:47,082 --> 00:19:48,953
Five, six, seven! Go!

317
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,825
<i>I've heard about but
not seen 25,000 miles.</i>

318
00:19:51,826 --> 00:19:52,493
<i>Yes, go on!</i>

319
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:56,446
<i>Who knows if it is easy or not.</i>

320
00:19:56,447 --> 00:19:58,901
<i>Move forward with head
down to find the real me.</i>

321
00:19:58,902 --> 00:19:59,901
Fire it up!

322
00:19:59,901 --> 00:20:00,276
Again!

323
00:20:00,277 --> 00:20:03,688
<i>Walking back and forth, losing myself.</i>

324
00:20:03,689 --> 00:20:04,064
Once more!

325
00:20:04,065 --> 00:20:07,144
<i>Rifles and millet are everything.</i>

326
00:20:07,768 --> 00:20:11,182
<i>Canons and bombers are truths.</i>

327
00:20:13,304 --> 00:20:14,470
<i>Not bad Chuan!</i>

328
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:17,758
<i>Now we're rocking!</i>

329
00:20:48,935 --> 00:20:50,599
Cui Jian, I love you.

330
00:20:56,011 --> 00:20:58,134
<i>Friends I once jammed with at bars</i>

331
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,922
<i>have released albums and headlined gigs.</i>

332
00:21:03,586 --> 00:21:04,585
<i>But I am still a nobody.</i>

333
00:21:10,204 --> 00:21:11,203
What's up?

334
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,741
After rehearsing for three years,

335
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:17,863
I'm finally ready.

336
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:20,028
You must come tomorrow.

337
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,525
We have to go now.

338
00:21:22,526 --> 00:21:23,483
- Will you come for the play?
- I'm afraid not.

339
00:21:23,484 --> 00:21:25,023
We have to catch a plane to U.S.A.

340
00:21:25,273 --> 00:21:26,272
See you on Broadway.

341
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,685
We'll tour the U.S. next!

342
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:28,685
Bye bye.

343
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:29,809
Take care!
Qin Lang.

344
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:31,849
Bye bye.

345
00:21:32,431 --> 00:21:34,470
Mr. Poet, what are you doing?

346
00:21:34,471 --> 00:21:35,761
Sunbathing.

347
00:21:35,762 --> 00:21:38,675
I love you like I love my motherland

348
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:43,046
but you've forsaken
the Yangtze and Yellow River.

349
00:21:43,462 --> 00:21:45,502
A pigeon as your parting gift.

350
00:21:46,876 --> 00:21:48,707
To hell, with your Yankee!

351
00:21:51,953 --> 00:21:54,908
Qin Lang, phone call for you.

352
00:21:55,866 --> 00:21:57,656
Hurry up, you slacker.

353
00:21:59,654 --> 00:22:00,653
Who is it?

354
00:22:13,514 --> 00:22:15,013
I am my family's only son.

355
00:22:15,971 --> 00:22:17,677
Dad has just been taken ill.

356
00:22:18,926 --> 00:22:20,299
So I came home.

357
00:22:24,378 --> 00:22:25,377
Brother.

358
00:22:27,542 --> 00:22:28,708
My Lang is back.

359
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:30,497
You wear your hair so long

360
00:22:30,872 --> 00:22:31,955
like a savage!

361
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,285
Look, your son is back.

362
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:42,943
Why the fuss?

363
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,106
What can happen to me?

364
00:22:54,597 --> 00:22:55,306
Brother,

365
00:22:55,306 --> 00:22:56,554
You didn't bring much with you.

366
00:22:57,429 --> 00:22:58,843
Are you not planning to stay?

367
00:23:07,127 --> 00:23:08,792
In fact, dad will retire soon.

368
00:23:09,957 --> 00:23:11,539
He has arranged for me to take his job.

369
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:13,357
To work in the same factory unit.

370
00:23:13,662 --> 00:23:15,785
But I'm not giving up on my dreams.

371
00:23:20,905 --> 00:23:21,944
Boss!

372
00:23:30,561 --> 00:23:31,976
Lang!

373
00:23:38,886 --> 00:23:40,592
How is your music career?

374
00:23:42,632 --> 00:23:43,796
I've been composing.

375
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,130
When you have a dream,

376
00:23:45,379 --> 00:23:46,878
the whole world is your stage.

377
00:23:48,876 --> 00:23:49,958
Who said that?

378
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:51,486
The old man at the corner store.

379
00:23:51,914 --> 00:23:52,913
Remember him?

380
00:23:53,122 --> 00:23:54,121
Who?

381
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,409
Here.

382
00:23:58,366 --> 00:23:58,949
Oh, yes!

383
00:23:59,281 --> 00:24:00,822
He even gave an interview a while ago.

384
00:24:05,899 --> 00:24:06,898
Is it still open?

385
00:24:08,522 --> 00:24:09,895
I think it's closed now.

386
00:24:11,394 --> 00:24:14,931
We used to draw on his walls.

387
00:24:14,932 --> 00:24:16,598
Yes, we're a nuisance.

388
00:24:17,804 --> 00:24:19,677
The old man would come and scold us.

389
00:24:20,135 --> 00:24:21,716
"Kids, if you want to draw"

390
00:24:21,717 --> 00:24:23,132
"please draw better."

391
00:24:32,997 --> 00:24:35,453
<i>I don't know who else to talk to.</i>

392
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:37,742
<i>If you happen to read this letter,</i>

393
00:24:38,408 --> 00:24:40,364
<i>I hope to get your advice.</i>

394
00:24:41,031 --> 00:24:42,362
<i>Small Town Musician.</i>

395
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:17,785
internet celeb?

396
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:20,158
Live stream?

397
00:25:21,364 --> 00:25:22,363
Don't drink.

398
00:25:22,696 --> 00:25:23,904
You just got better.

399
00:25:24,444 --> 00:25:26,526
What are your plans?

400
00:25:30,813 --> 00:25:32,020
After you have recovered,

401
00:25:32,645 --> 00:25:33,683
I will go back to Beijing.

402
00:25:34,393 --> 00:25:36,223
Don't worry about me.

403
00:25:36,224 --> 00:25:38,055
Think about yourself.

404
00:25:43,841 --> 00:25:45,507
I know what I'm doing.

405
00:25:46,214 --> 00:25:48,086
When you quit school for Beijing

406
00:25:48,087 --> 00:25:49,211
you assured us

407
00:25:49,793 --> 00:25:51,292
that you'd succeed.

408
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,164
Then why are you bumming around?

409
00:25:55,122 --> 00:25:56,121
Not me!

410
00:25:57,452 --> 00:25:59,243
Making music is not as
simple as you think.

411
00:26:00,075 --> 00:26:01,074
You won't understand.

412
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:02,405
Of course we won't.

413
00:26:03,072 --> 00:26:04,071
But I can tell,

414
00:26:04,237 --> 00:26:05,819
you talk louder than you sing.

415
00:26:13,186 --> 00:26:14,185
Brother.

416
00:26:14,227 --> 00:26:15,226
Lang.

417
00:26:15,434 --> 00:26:16,433
Sit down.

418
00:26:17,682 --> 00:26:19,097
<i>Everyone should have dreams.</i>

419
00:26:19,722 --> 00:26:21,095
<i>But life must go on.</i>

420
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,551
<i>Maybe take over your father's job,</i>

421
00:26:23,925 --> 00:26:25,007
<i>it's not so bad.</i>

422
00:26:42,115 --> 00:26:43,114
Uncle.

423
00:26:43,905 --> 00:26:44,904
Come here!

424
00:26:47,859 --> 00:26:48,858
Where have you been?

425
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:50,940
What happened?

426
00:26:51,272 --> 00:26:53,062
Don't you know dad has a heart problem?

427
00:26:53,063 --> 00:26:54,727
It can relapse anytime.

428
00:27:08,172 --> 00:27:09,171
Brother,

429
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:11,002
your health is deteriorating,

430
00:27:11,252 --> 00:27:13,417
shall we ask Qin Lang to come back?

431
00:27:14,956 --> 00:27:15,997
I'm fine.

432
00:27:16,455 --> 00:27:18,037
I can return to work in days.

433
00:27:18,453 --> 00:27:20,534
Stay off Qin Lang.

434
00:27:21,949 --> 00:27:23,240
I know you love your son,

435
00:27:23,739 --> 00:27:25,320
but the way he's living his life,

436
00:27:25,321 --> 00:27:26,569
can he even support himself?

437
00:27:26,986 --> 00:27:27,860
He can't just...

438
00:27:27,861 --> 00:27:29,650
bum around in Beijing, forever.

439
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:31,564
If you feel awkward,

440
00:27:31,565 --> 00:27:33,147
I can talk to him.

441
00:27:33,687 --> 00:27:35,644
Let him decide what to do with himself.

442
00:27:36,434 --> 00:27:37,555
When even I didn't speak up,

443
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,088
He doesn't need your parenting.

444
00:27:39,265 --> 00:27:39,848
Fine,

445
00:27:39,848 --> 00:27:40,347
Fine...

446
00:27:40,847 --> 00:27:41,721
Brother, please calm down.

447
00:27:41,722 --> 00:27:43,469
Forget what I said.

448
00:28:04,448 --> 00:28:06,404
<i>You don't have to
worry about my problems.</i>

449
00:28:07,527 --> 00:28:10,441
<i>Maybe it is better for me to stay home.</i>

450
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,085
Anyone there?

451
00:28:33,085 --> 00:28:34,084
No one.

452
00:28:35,249 --> 00:28:36,956
<i>Thanks for lending an ear to my problems</i>

453
00:28:37,581 --> 00:28:38,745
<i>and giving me replies.</i>

454
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:41,784
<i>In fact, I just wrote a song.</i>

455
00:28:42,741 --> 00:28:43,822
<i>The lyrics aren't done yet.</i>

456
00:28:44,157 --> 00:28:45,738
<i>So I've never performed it.</i>

457
00:28:47,611 --> 00:28:49,526
<i>But it is the song I love most.</i>

458
00:28:50,775 --> 00:28:52,493
<i>I want to play it for
you with my harmonica</i>

459
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,189
<i>as my way of saying thanks.</i>

460
00:28:59,849 --> 00:29:01,306
Isn't that Zhang Wei Wei's "Reborn"?

461
00:29:01,681 --> 00:29:02,638
It's her big hit.

462
00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:03,679
She sings it well.

463
00:29:34,605 --> 00:29:36,271
You all know the story behind this song?

464
00:29:44,595 --> 00:29:46,843
Maybe he should have given up.

465
00:29:48,508 --> 00:29:49,715
Then he won't...

466
00:29:52,337 --> 00:29:54,168
And no future for Zhang Wei Wei.

467
00:30:17,229 --> 00:30:18,353
<i>To tell you the truth,</i>

468
00:30:19,185 --> 00:30:21,640
I never wanted you to succeed me.

469
00:30:22,639 --> 00:30:25,137
But if your mind is made up,

470
00:30:25,386 --> 00:30:26,385
then so be it.

471
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,176
I'm your father.

472
00:30:28,842 --> 00:30:30,965
Can I not know what you're thinking?

473
00:30:31,422 --> 00:30:33,046
What's wrong with me staying?

474
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:36,417
Big talk!

475
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,748
Save it until you reach your goal.

476
00:30:39,331 --> 00:30:42,369
Go back to Beijing
and give it everything.

477
00:30:43,951 --> 00:30:45,033
Try your best!

478
00:30:45,533 --> 00:30:47,114
Don't give up even if you stumble.

479
00:30:48,655 --> 00:30:49,529
Otherwise,

480
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:50,695
don't come back here.

481
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:52,609
Do you understand?

482
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:57,728
Yes.

483
00:30:58,103 --> 00:30:59,102
Are you sure?

484
00:31:12,755 --> 00:31:14,420
<i>If someday.</i>

485
00:31:14,836 --> 00:31:16,334
<i>You can choose</i>

486
00:31:17,043 --> 00:31:19,665
<i>to relive your life or to continue</i>

487
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:25,367
<i>I don't know if your answer</i>

488
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:29,155
<i>will be your true sensation
or just a deception.</i>

489
00:31:29,738 --> 00:31:36,564
<i>I hope from blue sky to fame and fortune</i>

490
00:31:37,522 --> 00:31:40,477
<i>everything that you want</i>

491
00:31:41,642 --> 00:31:45,222
<i>will not vanish with the wind.</i>

492
00:31:46,221 --> 00:31:49,218
<i>They come and go</i>

493
00:31:49,592 --> 00:31:54,545
<i>freely like dust.</i>

494
00:31:55,129 --> 00:31:57,792
<i>Let me tell you</i>

495
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:03,661
<i>I once had problems.</i>

496
00:32:07,824 --> 00:32:08,823
Who is that?

497
00:32:08,989 --> 00:32:09,988
That's Madam Zhang.

498
00:32:10,238 --> 00:32:12,443
She founded The House of Rainbows
20 years ago.

499
00:32:12,444 --> 00:32:14,275
And she raised all the children here.

500
00:32:14,567 --> 00:32:16,357
That's why we're all Zhangs.

501
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,687
After she passed away,

502
00:32:20,311 --> 00:32:22,392
it became my duty to look after them,

503
00:32:22,683 --> 00:32:23,849
right up to this day.

504
00:32:27,636 --> 00:32:28,969
Those who have moved on

505
00:32:29,801 --> 00:32:30,967
often come back to visit,

506
00:32:31,674 --> 00:32:33,298
and bring money, food, clothes...

507
00:32:33,964 --> 00:32:34,963
Everything!

508
00:32:35,462 --> 00:32:37,169
Older kids will help the young,

509
00:32:37,543 --> 00:32:38,834
Seniors will help newcomers.

510
00:32:39,084 --> 00:32:40,498
I performed all over the country.

511
00:32:41,706 --> 00:32:42,330
I don't know why

512
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:44,369
but I feel most at home in this place.

513
00:32:46,117 --> 00:32:47,116
Right.

514
00:32:47,366 --> 00:32:50,113
I think the madam is
always watching over us.

515
00:32:53,819 --> 00:32:54,818
I bored you.

516
00:32:54,843 --> 00:32:55,775
Anyway,

517
00:32:56,066 --> 00:32:57,938
thank you for performing here.

518
00:32:57,939 --> 00:32:58,938
We all had a good time.

519
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:00,478
I should be thanking you

520
00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:02,725
for letting me sing for the children.

521
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,099
Thank you.

522
00:33:31,031 --> 00:33:34,817
The song you sang was really good.

523
00:33:34,818 --> 00:33:35,817
Thanks.

524
00:33:36,816 --> 00:33:38,648
I wrote it.

525
00:33:39,397 --> 00:33:40,396
Do you like it?

526
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:44,517
Does the song have a name?

527
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,721
"Reborn."

528
00:33:48,221 --> 00:33:49,428
"Reborn"?

529
00:33:50,136 --> 00:33:52,133
It tells your own story?

530
00:33:52,134 --> 00:33:53,133
You can tell?

531
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,422
Isn't that obvious?

532
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,253
What is your name?

533
00:33:57,254 --> 00:33:58,793
Zhang Wei Wei.

534
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:03,164
<i>If someday</i>

535
00:34:03,538 --> 00:34:05,328
<i>you can choose</i>

536
00:34:05,661 --> 00:34:08,492

<i>will be your true sensation

00:34:17,316 --> 00:34:23,560
<i>I hope from blue sky to fame and fortune,</i>

540
00:34:24,351 --> 00:34:27,598
<i>everything that you want</i>

541
00:34:28,013 --> 00:34:32,384
<i>will not vanish with the wind.</i>

542
00:34:36,713 --> 00:34:37,753
There's a fire!

543
00:34:38,003 --> 00:34:39,417
Children, run!

544
00:34:39,419 --> 00:34:40,458
Hurry up!

545
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,459
Go downstairs!

546
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:43,165
Hurry up!

547
00:34:47,910 --> 00:34:49,448
Mr. Qin, run! Hurry!

548
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:51,906
Help!

549
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,029
Mr. Zhang, take my guitar.

550
00:35:35,444 --> 00:35:36,443
Mr. Qin.

551
00:35:36,735 --> 00:35:37,734
Mr. Qin.

552
00:36:04,249 --> 00:36:05,788
<i>The relentless pursuit of your dreams</i>

553
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,786
<i>will be fully rewarded.</i>

554
00:36:08,328 --> 00:36:09,327
Trust me.

555
00:36:09,618 --> 00:36:11,491
<i>Countless people will be
comforted and inspired</i>

556
00:36:11,741 --> 00:36:13,198
<i>by your songs in the future.</i>

557
00:36:13,864 --> 00:36:15,570
<i>Persist on walking your own path</i>

558
00:36:16,278 --> 00:36:17,985
<i>until that final moment...</i>

559
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:25,893
This last song

560
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:29,181
was not only my first hit.

561
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:32,261
Its composer, Mr. Qin Lang,

562
00:36:34,134 --> 00:36:35,633
also saved my life.

563
00:36:38,089 --> 00:36:39,088
He gave me

564
00:36:39,837 --> 00:36:41,544
a second chance to live

565
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:43,916
and also a career in music.

566
00:36:44,957 --> 00:36:45,997
"Reborn."

567
00:36:45,997 --> 00:36:47,080
For you.

568
00:36:52,824 --> 00:36:54,364
<i>If someday.</i>

569
00:36:54,947 --> 00:36:56,528
<i>You can choose</i>

570
00:36:57,153 --> 00:36:59,983
<i>to relive your life or to continue.</i>

571
00:37:01,523 --> 00:37:05,767
<i>I don't know if your answer</i>

572
00:37:05,769 --> 00:37:08,933
<i>will be your true sensation
or just a deception.</i>

573
00:37:10,015 --> 00:37:16,675
<i>I hope from blue sky to fame and fortune,</i>

574
00:37:17,799 --> 00:37:20,712
<i>everything that you want</i>

575
00:37:21,711 --> 00:37:25,124
<i>will not vanish with the wind.</i>

576
00:37:26,456 --> 00:37:29,495
<i>Please tell me.</i>

577
00:37:30,369 --> 00:37:34,906
<i>Don't be silent like a riddle.</i>

578
00:37:35,281 --> 00:37:38,151
<i>They come and go</i>

579
00:37:38,153 --> 00:37:43,397
<i>freely like dust.</i>

580
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,977
<i>Let me tell you</i>

581
00:37:47,851 --> 00:37:52,179
<i>I once had problems,</i>

582
00:37:53,387 --> 00:37:59,131
<i>and you are now looking at the answer.</i>

583
00:38:14,906 --> 00:38:15,615
Papa,

584
00:38:15,616 --> 00:38:17,612
How can I win the gold on sports day?

585
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,984
Hold your own sports day!

586
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:52,410
Papa,

587
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:53,823
we are reporters from Close-Up, Bin Hai.

588
00:38:53,825 --> 00:38:55,322
Can we ask a few questions?

589
00:38:55,324 --> 00:38:57,696
Why do you want to
be an advice columnist?

590
00:39:00,485 --> 00:39:01,733
It's nothing.

591
00:39:02,233 --> 00:39:04,063
What was your motive

592
00:39:04,065 --> 00:39:06,229
in helping so many strangers?

593
00:39:08,269 --> 00:39:09,268
Thank you.

594
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:11,349
When facing these pranksters,

595
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,472
what do you think of them?

596
00:39:14,595 --> 00:39:16,053
I really don't have much to say.

597
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,177
How about...

598
00:39:17,177 --> 00:39:18,176
a photo, then?

599
00:39:18,341 --> 00:39:19,380
Take a few steps forward

600
00:39:19,382 --> 00:39:20,506
and we'll shoot a photo.

601
00:39:22,587 --> 00:39:23,836
Look right here...

602
00:39:23,836 --> 00:39:25,002
smile.

603
00:39:26,583 --> 00:39:28,165
Cheese!

604
00:39:45,314 --> 00:39:46,313
Beat it!

605
00:40:11,246 --> 00:40:12,245
What are you buying?

606
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,159
Michael Jackson.

607
00:40:15,533 --> 00:40:16,532
Three dollars.

608
00:40:21,444 --> 00:40:22,693
You follow pop stars?

609
00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:30,892
Isn't that Lin Yong Fei's boy?

610
00:40:31,267 --> 00:40:32,599
The rich spend differently,

611
00:40:32,974 --> 00:40:34,181
without a care in the world.

612
00:40:35,637 --> 00:40:36,843
Whose kid?

613
00:40:36,845 --> 00:40:37,885
Never heard of Lin?

614
00:40:38,718 --> 00:40:40,422
He's an automobile trader,

615
00:40:40,424 --> 00:40:41,631
made quite a fortune.

616
00:40:42,672 --> 00:40:43,879
Lin Yong Fei?

617
00:40:44,462 --> 00:40:45,544
Rings a bell...

618
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,038
What are you drawing?

619
00:40:52,495 --> 00:40:53,701
If you want to draw,

620
00:40:53,703 --> 00:40:54,368
draw better.

621
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:56,783
Papa is coming. Run!

622
00:42:01,384 --> 00:42:03,132
Michael Jackson.

623
00:42:21,529 --> 00:42:22,778
You have a sharp eye!

624
00:42:23,111 --> 00:42:24,191
It just got in yesterday

625
00:42:24,193 --> 00:42:25,192
and you found it.

626
00:42:26,024 --> 00:42:27,023
Fifty.

627
00:42:39,927 --> 00:42:40,926
Don't you want it?

628
00:42:42,674 --> 00:42:43,673
I'm short.

629
00:42:44,006 --> 00:42:45,005
Come over.

630
00:42:48,501 --> 00:42:49,500
How much do you have?

631
00:42:50,458 --> 00:42:51,457
35.50.

632
00:42:52,539 --> 00:42:55,077
Since you are a die-hard Michael fan,

633
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:56,357
you can have it for 35.

634
00:42:59,158 --> 00:43:00,239
Thank you, sir!

635
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:02,737
I don't want the change.

636
00:43:02,737 --> 00:43:03,820
Me neither!

637
00:43:15,224 --> 00:43:17,097
This 2 million loan,

638
00:43:17,472 --> 00:43:18,680
has now become

639
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:22,092
4.3 million with accrued interest.

640
00:43:22,509 --> 00:43:24,465
You're a month behind.

641
00:43:25,173 --> 00:43:27,004
Since I count you as a friend,

642
00:43:27,296 --> 00:43:29,335
I waive the month's interest.

643
00:43:29,335 --> 00:43:30,418
Isn't that something?

644
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:32,790
Why are you so late?

645
00:43:34,205 --> 00:43:35,535
My son is back.

646
00:43:35,537 --> 00:43:36,536
Come over.

647
00:43:36,661 --> 00:43:37,701
Greet my friends.

648
00:43:41,157 --> 00:43:42,363
Where are your manners?

649
00:43:42,738 --> 00:43:43,862
Where have you been?

650
00:43:52,395 --> 00:43:53,394
Open the door!

651
00:43:57,889 --> 00:43:58,888
Open up!

652
00:44:06,631 --> 00:44:09,044
Tell the boy to turn off the music!

653
00:44:10,667 --> 00:44:13,040
Turn the volume down please.

654
00:44:18,077 --> 00:44:19,448
Please give us a bit more time.

655
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:20,991
We will pay back the loan.

656
00:44:21,365 --> 00:44:23,114
If we fail this time,

657
00:44:24,029 --> 00:44:25,235
do whatever you want with us.

658
00:44:25,237 --> 00:44:26,360
We have no qualms.

659
00:44:29,607 --> 00:44:32,145
Madam, you're so gentle and pretty,

660
00:44:33,061 --> 00:44:34,518
since you made a personal plea,

661
00:44:34,935 --> 00:44:35,934
how can I refuse?

662
00:44:36,308 --> 00:44:37,307
Brother

663
00:44:38,806 --> 00:44:39,888
give me one more month.

664
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:42,135
I've greased all the right palms.

665
00:44:42,635 --> 00:44:44,394
Once the cars get here,
everything will go...

666
00:44:45,174 --> 00:44:46,173
Bingo!

667
00:44:48,962 --> 00:44:49,961
One more week.

668
00:45:05,695 --> 00:45:07,734
Your music is so loud,
you drive me nuts!

669
00:45:10,398 --> 00:45:11,895
What's your problem?

670
00:45:11,897 --> 00:45:14,309
Don't take your frustration
out on my son!

671
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:15,768
If you're so tough, hit me!

672
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:36,539
Uncle.

673
00:45:37,204 --> 00:45:38,203
Hi, uncle.

674
00:45:39,743 --> 00:45:40,865
Why come over

675
00:45:40,867 --> 00:45:42,116
on such a sweltering day?

676
00:45:44,156 --> 00:45:45,862
I haven't seen you for a while,

677
00:45:46,237 --> 00:45:47,985
and I was in the neighborhood.

678
00:45:50,399 --> 00:45:51,398
What is this?

679
00:45:52,272 --> 00:45:53,687
Michael Jackson.

680
00:45:54,561 --> 00:45:56,019
That's personal.

681
00:45:56,726 --> 00:45:57,725
None of your business.

682
00:45:58,141 --> 00:45:59,140
Uncle.

683
00:45:59,431 --> 00:46:00,597
Can I say something?

684
00:46:01,014 --> 00:46:02,178
It's good that you have a hobby

685
00:46:02,178 --> 00:46:03,717
to kill time.

686
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:04,718
But look at this,

687
00:46:05,384 --> 00:46:07,507
you're turning it into a post office!

688
00:46:08,297 --> 00:46:11,086
You're getting too
serious with those kids.

689
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:13,084
Those kids...

690
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:15,914
Despite their horsing around...

691
00:46:16,248 --> 00:46:18,953
they actually gave me good feedback.

692
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:22,283
One even wrote me recently from abroad

693
00:46:23,324 --> 00:46:24,987
to thank me.

694
00:46:24,989 --> 00:46:27,484
I heard you were interviewed
a few days ago.

695
00:46:27,486 --> 00:46:29,026
You're a celebrity now.

696
00:46:30,524 --> 00:46:31,815
It's no good being famous.

697
00:46:33,272 --> 00:46:35,434
Best to live a life of anonymity.

698
00:46:35,436 --> 00:46:37,018
I've asked you many times

699
00:46:37,018 --> 00:46:37,892
to move in

700
00:46:37,892 --> 00:46:38,891
and live with us.

701
00:46:39,557 --> 00:46:40,556
You live so far away.

702
00:46:40,973 --> 00:46:42,469
How can we look after you?

703
00:46:42,471 --> 00:46:43,636
We get worried.

704
00:46:43,636 --> 00:46:45,176
Enjoy your own lives.

705
00:46:45,509 --> 00:46:46,800
I'll be fine by myself.

706
00:46:47,674 --> 00:46:49,172
I don't want to be a burden.

707
00:46:53,854 --> 00:46:55,677
I read your letter, please ask
Mr. Jackson to pick up the letter.

708
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,655
<i>Mr. Jackson</i>

709
00:47:05,988 --> 00:47:10,109
<i>I'm not sure if my
interpretation is correct.</i>

710
00:47:10,567 --> 00:47:14,230
<i>However, do not worry,</i>

711
00:47:14,479 --> 00:47:18,559
<i>I'll answer all your questions,</i>

712
00:47:18,850 --> 00:47:20,973
<i>and keep them secret.</i>

713
00:47:21,681 --> 00:47:22,930
<i>Can you tell me,</i>

714
00:47:23,304 --> 00:47:24,719
<i>why you are so sad?</i>

715
00:47:28,465 --> 00:47:30,338
Where have you been all day?

716
00:47:35,583 --> 00:47:36,666
Are we moving?

717
00:47:37,331 --> 00:47:39,288
We are taking you on a trip.

718
00:47:41,286 --> 00:47:42,950
<i>Mom and Dad are acting strange.</i>

719
00:47:43,617 --> 00:47:44,948
<i>They're planning to take me away.</i>

720
00:47:45,697 --> 00:47:47,363
<i>I'm really disgusted with them.</i>

721
00:47:47,945 --> 00:47:49,444
<i>I'd rather be left on my own</i>

722
00:47:50,193 --> 00:47:52,316
<i>than keep living with them.</i>

723
00:47:53,065 --> 00:47:55,022
<i>I don't know what I should do.</i>

724
00:48:08,591 --> 00:48:09,632
Where are my CDs?

725
00:48:14,377 --> 00:48:15,417
Sold?

726
00:48:16,416 --> 00:48:19,974
How could you sell my stuff
without my permission?

727
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:21,078
<i>Kid,</i>

728
00:48:21,786 --> 00:48:22,993
<i>no matter what,</i>

729
00:48:23,368 --> 00:48:26,115
<i>your family is still your bedrock.</i>

730
00:48:26,947 --> 00:48:28,903
<i>Never walk out on them.</i>

731
00:48:29,612 --> 00:48:31,526
<i>When a family stays together,</i>

732
00:48:32,067 --> 00:48:34,065
<i>it can overcome all odds.</i>

733
00:48:35,022 --> 00:48:36,021
Does it still hurt?

734
00:48:37,769 --> 00:48:38,768
I was wrong to hit you.

735
00:48:39,143 --> 00:48:40,142
As long as you behave,

736
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:43,181
I'll never lay a finger on you.

737
00:48:46,885 --> 00:48:48,883
I have something important to tell you.

738
00:48:49,257 --> 00:48:50,340
You must not tell anyone.

739
00:48:51,464 --> 00:48:52,879
Pretty soon you'll start grade school.

740
00:48:54,711 --> 00:48:57,206
So it's a good time to move south,

741
00:48:57,208 --> 00:48:58,663
and find you a better school.

742
00:48:58,665 --> 00:48:59,664
You are lying.

743
00:48:59,872 --> 00:49:01,120
You just wanted to move.

744
00:49:02,369 --> 00:49:04,492
This conversation stays between us.

745
00:49:05,075 --> 00:49:07,031
Only pack what's important to you.

746
00:49:07,573 --> 00:49:09,529
I've arranged everything for you and mom.

747
00:49:10,902 --> 00:49:12,568
You didn't say it but I know you hate me.

748
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,065
You think I'm a loser.

749
00:49:15,772 --> 00:49:16,854
But I promise you,

750
00:49:17,687 --> 00:49:18,686
before long,

751
00:49:18,894 --> 00:49:21,766
we will prosper again like before.

752
00:49:23,223 --> 00:49:26,012
I care for nothing but this family.

753
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:28,634
For this family,

754
00:49:29,051 --> 00:49:30,382
I will do anything

755
00:49:30,674 --> 00:49:32,089
even giving up my life.

756
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:35,625
<i>A 13-year-old American boy,</i>

757
00:49:35,627 --> 00:49:36,666
<i>Jordan Chandler</i>

758
00:49:36,668 --> 00:49:38,872
<i>has accused the famous pop star</i>

759
00:49:38,874 --> 00:49:41,121
<i>Michael Jackson of sexual assault.</i>

760
00:49:41,621 --> 00:49:43,994
<i>Jackson has denied the accusation...</i>

761
00:49:44,243 --> 00:49:46,364
<i>Allegedly since 1992</i>

762
00:49:46,366 --> 00:49:48,279
<i>Jackson has invited children to visit</i>

763
00:49:48,281 --> 00:49:50,277
<i>his Neverland Ranch.</i>

764
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:51,638
This is not suitable for children,

765
00:49:51,694 --> 00:49:52,610
X-rated!

766
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:55,272
<i>Neverland Ranch is to make
up for his lost childhood.</i>

767
00:49:55,274 --> 00:49:57,270
<i>His fans from around the world</i>

768
00:49:57,272 --> 00:49:58,271
<i>are stunned.</i>

769
00:49:58,521 --> 00:50:00,519
<i>If the boy's family
decides to press charges,</i>

770
00:50:00,809 --> 00:50:03,389
<i>whether or not Jackson is found guilty,</i>

771
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:06,762
<i>he'll have to undergo
lengthy investigations...</i>

772
00:50:23,828 --> 00:50:25,243
Hao Bo!

773
00:50:26,408 --> 00:50:27,741
Hao Bo!

774
00:50:29,155 --> 00:50:30,113
Come up.

775
00:50:30,114 --> 00:50:31,278
We have to hurry.

776
00:50:32,444 --> 00:50:33,526
Don't mess things up.

777
00:50:51,467 --> 00:50:53,964
Mom, where are we going?

778
00:50:58,043 --> 00:50:59,583
I don't really know.

779
00:51:00,623 --> 00:51:01,831
But don't worry.

780
00:51:02,288 --> 00:51:03,495
Dad has everything sorted out.

781
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:06,409
You're all lying to me.

782
00:51:07,366 --> 00:51:08,990
Give me my CD money!

783
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:11,737
They were sold for scraps.

784
00:51:11,737 --> 00:51:13,277
They're worthless.

785
00:51:13,819 --> 00:51:15,775
Where's your pocket money?

786
00:51:16,566 --> 00:51:18,022
Pocket money?

787
00:51:18,564 --> 00:51:20,645
There'll be no pocket money from now on.

788
00:51:24,848 --> 00:51:25,929
I need to go to the toilet.

789
00:51:39,542 --> 00:51:40,541
Hao Bo,

790
00:51:41,373 --> 00:51:42,830
I'm leaving the umbrella here.

791
00:51:51,321 --> 00:51:52,570
Why did you get out?

792
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:53,361
Go back, go back!

793
00:51:53,361 --> 00:51:54,152
Where's the boy?

794
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:55,692
He's still in the toilet.

795
00:51:55,692 --> 00:51:57,230
You can't just leave him.

796
00:51:57,232 --> 00:51:58,148
I left him an umbrella.

797
00:51:58,149 --> 00:51:59,228
Get back in the car.

798
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:00,146
Where are we going?

799
00:52:00,147 --> 00:52:01,436
Cut this out!

800
00:52:01,436 --> 00:52:02,185
Get in quick!

801
00:52:02,187 --> 00:52:04,225
I can't leave without
knowing where we're going.

802
00:52:25,953 --> 00:52:26,952
Have you eaten?

803
00:52:27,202 --> 00:52:28,201
Yes.

804
00:52:28,533 --> 00:52:29,782
Let's meet up soon.

805
00:53:44,872 --> 00:53:46,038
Goodbye.

806
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:48,535
You can't spend the night here.

807
00:53:52,115 --> 00:53:53,114
Give it to me.

808
00:53:53,322 --> 00:53:54,321
C'mon, stand up.

809
00:53:55,361 --> 00:53:56,360
What on earth is this?

810
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:57,942
All my feelings are in there.

811
00:53:58,608 --> 00:53:59,732
What did you say?

812
00:53:59,982 --> 00:54:01,064
Long live rock 'n' roll!

813
00:54:02,354 --> 00:54:03,645
Yeah, you'd wish.

814
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,336
You really are stubborn.

815
00:54:20,752 --> 00:54:22,624
Speak up! Your parents must be worried.

816
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:24,247
The police will arrive in 30 minutes.

817
00:54:24,249 --> 00:54:26,580
Then you will have to go with these two.

818
00:54:27,454 --> 00:54:28,772
It'll be too late for me to help.

819
00:54:30,118 --> 00:54:30,742
In a few days,

820
00:54:30,743 --> 00:54:33,321
you will be sent to
the Civil Services Department

821
00:54:33,323 --> 00:54:35,029
or a youth detention center.

822
00:54:35,403 --> 00:54:36,861
That wouldn't be fun.

823
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,399
Lunch is served!

824
00:54:40,108 --> 00:54:41,107
Coming.

825
00:54:49,639 --> 00:54:50,638
The window.

826
00:54:51,971 --> 00:54:52,970
Window.

827
00:55:06,331 --> 00:55:07,330
Go.

828
00:56:07,809 --> 00:56:09,516
I'd like to introduce a new friend.

829
00:56:10,141 --> 00:56:12,139
He doesn't remember his own name

830
00:56:12,429 --> 00:56:14,095
or where he comes from.

831
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:16,259
It's okay.

832
00:56:16,759 --> 00:56:17,633
Forget the past,

833
00:56:17,634 --> 00:56:19,381
cherish the present.

834
00:56:22,211 --> 00:56:23,730
I don't think you're much of a talker.

835
00:56:24,459 --> 00:56:26,874
You must be quietly introspecting.

836
00:56:28,455 --> 00:56:29,787
We all adopted the surname Zhang.

837
00:56:30,495 --> 00:56:31,575
Why don't we call you Mo...

838
00:56:32,159 --> 00:56:33,158
as in "silence."

839
00:56:34,116 --> 00:56:35,697
Let's welcome Zhang Mo!

840
00:56:41,275 --> 00:56:43,315
This is your home from now on.

841
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:45,479
Customarily,

842
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,103
since today is Zhang Mo's first day,

843
00:56:48,018 --> 00:56:50,474
it is also his birthday.

844
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:51,929
Let's wish him a happy birthday.

845
00:56:51,931 --> 00:56:52,513
Okay?

846
00:56:52,515 --> 00:56:54,595
Good.

847
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:58,507
Happy Birthday to you!

848
00:56:58,757 --> 00:57:02,295
Happy Birthday to you!

849
00:57:02,837 --> 00:57:06,583
Happy Birthday to you!

850
00:57:06,833 --> 00:57:11,036
Happy Birthday to you!

851
00:57:13,076 --> 00:57:14,075
Uncle.

852
00:57:16,406 --> 00:57:17,405
Uncle.

853
00:57:17,488 --> 00:57:18,487
What is it?

854
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:20,069
You asked to see me.

855
00:57:20,693 --> 00:57:21,692
Something wrong?

856
00:57:28,601 --> 00:57:30,017
Yes, I've heard of this Lin.

857
00:57:30,683 --> 00:57:31,682
What about him?

858
00:57:33,513 --> 00:57:35,759
Remember the kid who wrote me?

859
00:57:35,761 --> 00:57:36,760
The illustrator.

860
00:57:40,673 --> 00:57:42,337
Lately I've been thinking.

861
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,043
The advice I gave people,

862
00:57:46,542 --> 00:57:47,541
was it helpful?

863
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:49,705
Could my advice

864
00:57:50,246 --> 00:57:51,870
even lead them

865
00:57:53,785 --> 00:57:55,366
to catastrophe?

866
00:57:57,905 --> 00:57:59,320
Whenever I think of this

867
00:58:00,278 --> 00:58:02,816
I feel a cold shudder down my spine.

868
00:58:07,062 --> 00:58:08,935
I can't write these letters anymore.

869
00:58:14,471 --> 00:58:15,762
It's time.

870
00:58:19,424 --> 00:58:20,757
Can I move in with you?

871
00:58:21,132 --> 00:58:22,421
Didn't I tell you already?

872
00:58:22,421 --> 00:58:24,253
We've kept a room for you.

873
00:58:27,541 --> 00:58:28,540
Uncle.

874
00:58:29,248 --> 00:58:31,287
Are you feeling okay?

875
00:58:32,286 --> 00:58:33,285
I am fine.

876
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,783
Hopefully I won't be a nuisance.

877
00:58:37,781 --> 00:58:39,446
We are family.

878
00:58:39,862 --> 00:58:41,111
Just consider me your son.

879
00:58:51,434 --> 00:58:52,682
Uncle, get in the car.

880
00:59:46,419 --> 00:59:47,418
Uncle

881
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:49,874
you are still on the mend,

882
00:59:50,456 --> 00:59:52,619
it's too cold for you to make this trip.

883
00:59:52,621 --> 00:59:53,620
Why?

884
00:59:55,201 --> 00:59:56,200
Even if I'd told you

885
00:59:56,325 --> 00:59:57,616
you wouldn't understand.

886
00:59:58,823 --> 00:59:59,864
Ever since

887
01:00:00,238 --> 01:00:01,529
I closed the store,

888
01:00:03,193 --> 01:00:05,108
I've had the same dream.

889
01:00:05,691 --> 01:00:07,314
I dreamt of the store

890
01:00:09,604 --> 01:00:11,394
as if it were right in front of me.

891
01:00:13,308 --> 01:00:16,139
I saw people from the future

892
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:18,095
write to tell me,

893
01:00:20,385 --> 01:00:22,715
about changes in their lives.

894
01:00:56,098 --> 01:00:57,222
Strange.

895
01:00:58,221 --> 01:00:59,426
It's been closed for months.

896
01:00:59,428 --> 01:01:00,884
It's still spotless.

897
01:01:09,584 --> 01:01:10,583
Uncle.

898
01:01:11,374 --> 01:01:12,831
It's late. Go to bed.

899
01:01:14,662 --> 01:01:15,953
Go sleep upstairs.

900
01:01:17,326 --> 01:01:18,741
I want to stay a little longer.

901
01:01:21,655 --> 01:01:22,279
Okay.

902
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:23,361
I'll go to bed now.

903
01:01:23,363 --> 01:01:24,402
Just yell if you need me.

904
01:02:43,197 --> 01:02:44,320
My dear uncle,

905
01:02:45,319 --> 01:02:46,318
Why are you...

906
01:02:46,651 --> 01:02:48,358
still burning the midnight oil?

907
01:02:48,733 --> 01:02:50,772
Are these letters for you?

908
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:54,852
Let me see.

909
01:02:55,351 --> 01:02:57,474
December 31, '17.

910
01:02:58,139 --> 01:02:59,555
It's even a printed letter.

911
01:02:59,847 --> 01:03:01,345
They're all from the future.

912
01:03:04,842 --> 01:03:06,048
The future?

913
01:03:11,792 --> 01:03:13,333
Michael Jackson.

914
01:03:25,945 --> 01:03:27,235
I'm such an old fool,

915
01:03:28,109 --> 01:03:29,482
so pathetic!

916
01:03:30,981 --> 01:03:32,979
I thought my advice

917
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:35,685
would bring misfortune to others.

918
01:03:37,933 --> 01:03:40,055
Why would I have such power?

919
01:03:40,888 --> 01:03:41,929
Don't say that.

920
01:03:42,469 --> 01:03:44,759
Everyone now writes to thank you.

921
01:03:45,758 --> 01:03:46,757
I...

922
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:49,504
have never helped anyone.

923
01:03:49,878 --> 01:03:52,334
When they came to me with a problem,

924
01:03:53,957 --> 01:03:55,955
they already knew the answer.

925
01:03:59,618 --> 01:04:01,284
But if they don't even try,

926
01:04:02,033 --> 01:04:04,156
nothing I write will help them.

927
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:07,153
They have only themselves to thank.

928
01:04:22,762 --> 01:04:25,634
Who would slip in a blank page
at this ungodly hour?

929
01:04:25,925 --> 01:04:27,007
Who could that be?

930
01:04:30,629 --> 01:04:31,753
Let me think it over.

931
01:04:33,001 --> 01:04:34,375
What's there to think about?

932
01:04:36,331 --> 01:04:37,330
Take this.

933
01:04:37,954 --> 01:04:39,286
Read it in the car.

934
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:41,658
Also,

935
01:04:44,989 --> 01:04:45,988
this is for you.

936
01:04:47,694 --> 01:04:49,151
What's that for?

937
01:04:49,859 --> 01:04:51,898
Just take it.

938
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:54,021
Besides,

939
01:04:55,478 --> 01:04:56,977
these letters from the future.

940
01:04:57,601 --> 01:04:59,141
Keep them safe for me.

941
01:05:00,598 --> 01:05:02,887
Uncle, why do you want to keep these?

942
01:05:04,510 --> 01:05:06,300
Heavenly secrets cannot be divulged.

943
01:05:07,799 --> 01:05:08,465
Okay.

944
01:05:08,466 --> 01:05:09,922
I'll wait for you in the car.

945
01:05:22,034 --> 01:05:23,700
<i>I never married.</i>

946
01:05:24,574 --> 01:05:26,197
<i>You are like a son to me.</i>

947
01:05:26,779 --> 01:05:28,153
<i>You looked after me,</i>

948
01:05:29,194 --> 01:05:31,233
<i>and I am forever grateful.</i>

949
01:05:32,441 --> 01:05:35,562
<i>Please do me another favor.</i>

950
01:05:36,145 --> 01:05:38,392
<i>Consider it my last wish.</i>

951
01:05:39,349 --> 01:05:41,389
<i>In the next 25 years</i>

952
01:05:42,763 --> 01:05:45,218
<i>do not sell the store</i>

953
01:05:45,968 --> 01:05:47,258
<i>or demolish it.</i>

954
01:05:48,257 --> 01:05:50,422
<i>Do your best to maintain it.</i>

955
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:52,836
<i>The letters I received,</i>

956
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:55,458
<i>please keep them safe.</i>

957
01:05:56,998 --> 01:05:58,372
<i>After 25 years,</i>

958
01:05:59,079 --> 01:06:00,662
<i>before the anniversary of my death,</i>

959
01:06:01,577 --> 01:06:03,534
<i>announce for me,</i>

960
01:06:04,491 --> 01:06:06,905
<i>that the store's counseling service</i>

961
01:06:08,237 --> 01:06:11,941
<i>will be back for just
one night until midnight.</i>

962
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:16,437
<i>Whoever got advice
from me in the past</i>

963
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:18,559
<i>is invited to write in</i>

964
01:06:19,351 --> 01:06:23,429
<i>and tell me if the advice they received</i>

965
01:06:24,387 --> 01:06:26,885
<i>had any impact on their lives.</i>

966
01:06:28,175 --> 01:06:29,632
<i>Also, for my funeral</i>

967
01:06:30,339 --> 01:06:31,630
<i>keep it simple.</i>

968
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:35,334
<i>I don't want to be a nuisance.</i>

969
01:07:34,107 --> 01:07:36,439
Mr. Zhang, congratulations on the show!

970
01:07:36,854 --> 01:07:37,853
Thank you.

971
01:07:38,437 --> 01:07:40,058
In only five years since graduating

972
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:41,350
you have already achieved recognition

973
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:43,223
from both home and abroad.

974
01:07:43,473 --> 01:07:45,720
Among our many budding artists

975
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:47,011
you've been very fortunate.

976
01:07:47,303 --> 01:07:48,010
We know

977
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:50,300
you're enormously creative.

978
01:07:50,757 --> 01:07:52,505
So, among all your works

979
01:07:52,838 --> 01:07:54,295
do you have a favorite?

980
01:07:55,170 --> 01:07:56,418
It should be my life.

981
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:58,749
Are we done?

982
01:07:59,498 --> 01:08:00,164
We all know

983
01:08:00,165 --> 01:08:02,912
that you grew up in an orphanage.

984
01:08:03,577 --> 01:08:04,826
Does this life experience

985
01:08:04,826 --> 01:08:06,699
come through in any of the exhibits?

986
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:11,195
It's a common perception,

987
01:08:11,778 --> 01:08:13,776
that orphans must have gone through

988
01:08:14,107 --> 01:08:15,274
a life of misery.

989
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:17,937
But I may be an exception.

990
01:08:17,938 --> 01:08:19,062
My recollections

991
01:08:21,268 --> 01:08:22,517
are all heart-warming.

992
01:08:24,432 --> 01:08:26,719
This feeling is also
reflected in my works.

993
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:28,384
What about your biological parents,

994
01:08:28,386 --> 01:08:29,426
relatives?

995
01:08:29,427 --> 01:08:31,464
Did they influence your works?

996
01:08:33,587 --> 01:08:35,211
I mean...

997
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:37,751
I often sense solitude in your work,

998
01:08:38,126 --> 01:08:39,125
desperation,

999
01:08:39,167 --> 01:08:40,166
cries of anguish,

1000
01:08:40,665 --> 01:08:42,621
are you trying to seek redemption

1001
01:08:43,537 --> 01:08:44,786
through your paintings?

1002
01:08:49,071 --> 01:08:50,070
Mr. Zhang...

1003
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:51,237
We'll talk again,

1004
01:08:51,319 --> 01:08:52,318
thank you.

1005
01:08:52,443 --> 01:08:53,442
Mr. Zhang.

1006
01:08:53,485 --> 01:08:54,484
Mr. Zhang.

1007
01:08:55,690 --> 01:08:56,857
Congratulations!

1008
01:09:25,744 --> 01:09:27,158
It's beautiful.

1009
01:09:27,532 --> 01:09:28,906
When you were kids,

1010
01:09:28,906 --> 01:09:30,947
everyone was scavenging for bottles,

1011
01:09:31,903 --> 01:09:34,485
but you'd draw all day.

1012
01:09:35,442 --> 01:09:37,647
Well, it makes an artist out of you.

1013
01:09:37,981 --> 01:09:40,104
This mural must worth a fortune now.

1014
01:09:40,519 --> 01:09:41,518
I owe my life

1015
01:09:42,767 --> 01:09:44,058
to the House of Rainbows.

1016
01:09:44,308 --> 01:09:45,557
This mural is priceless.

1017
01:10:16,732 --> 01:10:17,731
What'd you like?

1018
01:10:22,686 --> 01:10:24,349
This didn't use to be a bar, right?

1019
01:10:26,265 --> 01:10:27,721
It used to be an AV shop.

1020
01:10:27,721 --> 01:10:29,053
Since there are more tourists these days,

1021
01:10:29,054 --> 01:10:30,374
I turned it into an old-time bar.

1022
01:10:31,010 --> 01:10:32,009
What'd you like?

1023
01:10:32,091 --> 01:10:32,544
Whisky.

1024
01:10:32,965 --> 01:10:33,964
Single malt.

1025
01:10:42,041 --> 01:10:43,040
Thank you.

1026
01:10:44,329 --> 01:10:45,328
I've collected these.

1027
01:10:46,994 --> 01:10:48,114
Michael lived a tragic life.

1028
01:10:48,449 --> 01:10:49,948
He was notorious when alive,

1029
01:10:50,198 --> 01:10:52,196
at least he was cleared in death.

1030
01:10:53,404 --> 01:10:55,860
June 28, 2009.

1031
01:10:57,483 --> 01:10:58,689
On the day of June 28th

1032
01:10:59,523 --> 01:11:00,602
the alleged victim admitted

1033
01:11:01,061 --> 01:11:02,645
he falsely accused Michael for money.

1034
01:11:03,684 --> 01:11:04,726
A die-hard fan!

1035
01:11:05,517 --> 01:11:06,516
Hang on...

1036
01:11:12,593 --> 01:11:13,923
This is part of my collection

1037
01:11:14,673 --> 01:11:16,171
I have more at home.

1038
01:11:17,505 --> 01:11:18,793
Even his original imports.

1039
01:11:45,101 --> 01:11:46,140
Where did you get this?

1040
01:11:46,975 --> 01:11:47,974
Let me see.

1041
01:11:51,845 --> 01:11:53,551
This CD has history.

1042
01:11:55,381 --> 01:11:58,421
It was during the '90s.

1043
01:11:58,877 --> 01:12:02,789
I got it from a scrap merchant.

1044
01:12:02,791 --> 01:12:03,541
He told me

1045
01:12:03,542 --> 01:12:05,620
he got it from the home

1046
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:06,330
of a local big shot.

1047
01:12:06,579 --> 01:12:07,578
What was his name?

1048
01:12:09,452 --> 01:12:11,281
I've forgotten.

1049
01:12:11,283 --> 01:12:13,072
But he was a celebrity from around here.

1050
01:12:13,073 --> 01:12:13,780
Really well-known.

1051
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:14,779
And rich, too...

1052
01:12:15,610 --> 01:12:18,607
until he couldn't pay the loan sharks.

1053
01:12:18,607 --> 01:12:19,606
He ran away.

1054
01:12:20,024 --> 01:12:22,603
It shocked the whole neighborhood.

1055
01:12:24,436 --> 01:12:25,809
And made the front pages.

1056
01:12:25,810 --> 01:12:26,849
I kept a copy.

1057
01:12:26,849 --> 01:12:27,848
Come.

1058
01:12:39,046 --> 01:12:40,045
Here.

1059
01:12:41,584 --> 01:12:42,708
The whole family perished.

1060
01:12:43,542 --> 01:12:44,581
The man left a death note.

1061
01:12:46,204 --> 01:12:46,828
Hey, boss.

1062
01:12:47,203 --> 01:12:48,202
Check, please.

1063
01:12:49,161 --> 01:12:50,160
Take a look.

1064
01:13:03,896 --> 01:13:05,228
My child...

1065
01:13:07,475 --> 01:13:09,971
Find me my son!

1066
01:13:09,973 --> 01:13:11,596
Bring him back.

1067
01:13:12,595 --> 01:13:13,511
We will find him.

1068
01:13:13,511 --> 01:13:14,843
We're doing that right now.

1069
01:13:20,169 --> 01:13:21,168
That's him. Get him!

1070
01:13:23,291 --> 01:13:24,540
It's Yang.

1071
01:13:25,289 --> 01:13:26,288
Sit tight.

1072
01:13:30,077 --> 01:13:30,471
Lin,

1073
01:13:30,993 --> 01:13:32,656
where are you taking your wife?

1074
01:13:33,698 --> 01:13:34,822
Roll down the window.

1075
01:13:36,363 --> 01:13:36,945
Lin,

1076
01:13:37,362 --> 01:13:38,276
pull over!

1077
01:13:38,277 --> 01:13:39,360
Stop the car!

1078
01:13:40,234 --> 01:13:41,233
Stop.

1079
01:13:41,522 --> 01:13:42,521
Ram him.

1080
01:13:43,770 --> 01:13:44,354
Stop!

1081
01:13:44,354 --> 01:13:45,559
Pull over!

1082
01:13:45,561 --> 01:13:46,560
Stop now.

1083
01:13:46,892 --> 01:13:47,891
Ram him!

1084
01:13:50,763 --> 01:13:51,762
Pull over.

1085
01:13:51,762 --> 01:13:52,761
Stop.

1086
01:13:56,842 --> 01:13:58,465
Stop.

1087
01:14:10,243 --> 01:14:11,660
Oh god, I'm losing control...

1088
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,174
<i>I am not only heavily in debt</i>

1089
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:22,088
<i>I've caused the death
of my wife and child.</i>

1090
01:15:23,168 --> 01:15:24,542
<i>I deserved to be punished.</i>

1091
01:15:25,916 --> 01:15:27,582
<i>My death today will end it all.</i>

1092
01:15:28,663 --> 01:15:29,662
<i>It's retribution.</i>

1093
01:15:31,453 --> 01:15:32,452
<i>My darling wife,</i>

1094
01:15:32,702 --> 01:15:33,701
<i>my darling boy,</i>

1095
01:15:34,032 --> 01:15:35,531
<i>I have let you down...</i>

1096
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:38,653
<i>Today we die together.</i>

1097
01:15:38,653 --> 01:15:42,024
<i>Let's be a family again
in our next lives.</i>

1098
01:16:36,593 --> 01:16:37,592
Kid

1099
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:39,633
no matter what,

1100
01:16:40,215 --> 01:16:42,712
you can always count on your family.

1101
01:16:43,711 --> 01:16:45,544
Never walk out on them.

1102
01:16:46,376 --> 01:16:48,499
When a family stays together,

1103
01:16:49,081 --> 01:16:51,079
they can overcome anything.

1104
01:16:52,995 --> 01:16:53,994
<i>I wrote you 25 years ago.</i>

1105
01:16:54,368 --> 01:16:56,448
<i>I called myself Michael Jackson.</i>

1106
01:16:56,908 --> 01:16:57,989
<i>Do you still remember me?</i>

1107
01:16:59,030 --> 01:17:00,029
<i>I told you</i>

1108
01:17:00,737 --> 01:17:02,358
<i>my parents were acting strange</i>

1109
01:17:02,360 --> 01:17:03,440
<i>and wanted to take me away.</i>

1110
01:17:03,858 --> 01:17:05,230
<i>I was disgusted with them.</i>

1111
01:17:05,232 --> 01:17:06,648
<i>I didn't want to live with them.</i>

1112
01:17:07,771 --> 01:17:09,331
<i>Thank you for not dismissing my drawing</i>

1113
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:10,559
<i>as some bad joke.</i>

1114
01:17:10,976 --> 01:17:12,392
<i>You gave me sincere advice.</i>

1115
01:17:13,391 --> 01:17:14,390
<i>You said:</i>

1116
01:17:14,679 --> 01:17:16,013
<i>When a family stays together</i>

1117
01:17:16,346 --> 01:17:17,551
<i>they can overcome anything.</i>

1118
01:17:18,469 --> 01:17:19,799
<i>I believe you were right.</i>

1119
01:17:20,508 --> 01:17:22,090
<i>I've had a wonderful life</i>

1120
01:17:22,921 --> 01:17:24,794
<i>and I owe it all to you.</i>

1121
01:17:25,918 --> 01:17:26,917
<i>Thank you.</i>

1122
01:18:49,168 --> 01:18:50,247
The Golden Voice Challenge.

1123
01:18:50,999 --> 01:18:51,998
Go sign up.

1124
01:18:52,330 --> 01:18:53,578
The deadline's coming up.

1125
01:18:56,410 --> 01:18:58,533
If I enter this contest

1126
01:18:59,073 --> 01:19:01,030
and tell them I'm an orphan,

1127
01:19:01,031 --> 01:19:02,737
would they let me skip the qualifiers?

1128
01:19:03,818 --> 01:19:05,525
Not unless you blend our hard-luck tales

1129
01:19:05,526 --> 01:19:06,856
into your own story.

1130
01:19:06,858 --> 01:19:08,773
Might as well crown me the champ!

1131
01:19:19,761 --> 01:19:21,010
Compared to Jie,

1132
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:22,342
we are very lucky.

1133
01:19:24,340 --> 01:19:25,658
Whenever he drinks one too much,

1134
01:19:26,837 --> 01:19:28,418
he talks about his hostess mother

1135
01:19:28,418 --> 01:19:30,056
and those hooligans who could be his dad.

1136
01:19:30,334 --> 01:19:31,999
He was lucky to have made it out

1137
01:19:32,374 --> 01:19:33,997
or he'd have been killed a long time ago.

1138
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:43,570
Which song should I sing?

1139
01:19:47,191 --> 01:19:48,190
"Reborn."

1140
01:19:55,683 --> 01:19:57,388
<i>If someday.</i>

1141
01:19:57,681 --> 01:19:59,429
<i>You can choose</i>

1142
01:19:59,761 --> 01:20:02,299
<i>to relive your life or to continue.</i>

1143
01:20:02,301 --> 01:20:03,175
Will you two ever stop?

1144
01:20:03,176 --> 01:20:04,496
Can I get some sleep around here?

1145
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:05,797
Easy, okay?

1146
01:20:05,797 --> 01:20:07,128
I'm telling you,
do what you want with your music

1147
01:20:07,128 --> 01:20:08,647
just don't drag Xiao Bo down with you.

1148
01:20:15,288 --> 01:20:16,536
The Lost Wang Wang.

1149
01:20:22,697 --> 01:20:24,403
The Lost Wang Wang.

1150
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:26,526
Even the name is ridiculous.

1151
01:20:26,901 --> 01:20:28,107
Don't bother reading

1152
01:20:28,107 --> 01:20:29,106
or replying.

1153
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:29,940
It won't change anything.

1154
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:31,353
What destined to happen will happen.

1155
01:20:31,353 --> 01:20:32,770
"To the Namiya Store:"

1156
01:20:33,601 --> 01:20:34,893
"I work as a hostess."

1157
01:20:35,474 --> 01:20:36,683
"I heard of you by chance..."

1158
01:20:41,593 --> 01:20:43,051
<i>I am a hostess.</i>

1159
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:44,882
<i>I'm nineteen,</i>

1160
01:20:45,674 --> 01:20:46,922
<i>working in a night club.</i>

1161
01:20:49,210 --> 01:20:50,958
<i>The place is littered with low lives,</i>

1162
01:20:52,082 --> 01:20:53,541
<i>but because the pay is good,</i>

1163
01:20:54,290 --> 01:20:58,326
<i>I do my best to put up with them.</i>

1164
01:21:28,130 --> 01:21:29,544
What do you want?

1165
01:21:30,877 --> 01:21:31,876
Getting my mail.

1166
01:21:34,249 --> 01:21:35,498
Bullshit!

1167
01:21:38,578 --> 01:21:41,032
If you have a problem,
drop the old man a line.

1168
01:21:42,281 --> 01:21:44,400
He'll leave you a reply in
the milk box the next day.

1169
01:22:03,469 --> 01:22:07,380
<i>Tonight you should understand.</i>

1170
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:09,546
<i>Destiny will not go away easy.</i>

1171
01:22:10,712 --> 01:22:14,083
<i>Love will not go away easily.</i>

1172
01:22:21,534 --> 01:22:22,699
With Mr. Su's compliment.

1173
01:22:31,149 --> 01:22:34,437
Thank you, Mr. Su for your support.

1174
01:22:35,311 --> 01:22:35,851
Here.

1175
01:22:36,101 --> 01:22:37,349
A toast to Mr. Su.

1176
01:22:39,432 --> 01:22:40,671
You've been drinking all night.

1177
01:22:40,971 --> 01:22:41,970
Stop it.

1178
01:22:42,929 --> 01:22:44,135
Have a soft drink instead.

1179
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:45,801
<i>However,</i>

1180
01:22:46,883 --> 01:22:48,631
<i>I have an admirer lately.</i>

1181
01:22:50,254 --> 01:22:52,044
<i>He's different from the others.</i>

1182
01:22:54,292 --> 01:22:55,291
A girl

1183
01:22:55,541 --> 01:22:56,914
should treat herself well.

1184
01:23:02,449 --> 01:23:03,448
Thanks.

1185
01:23:16,602 --> 01:23:18,226
Pick anything you fancy.

1186
01:23:19,017 --> 01:23:20,141
I really hope that

1187
01:23:20,473 --> 01:23:22,471
I can have my own shop one day.

1188
01:23:22,971 --> 01:23:24,261
If you want this shop,

1189
01:23:25,425 --> 01:23:28,257
you can have it.

1190
01:23:32,293 --> 01:23:34,291
<i>He wants me to become his lover.</i>

1191
01:23:34,791 --> 01:23:36,164
<i>I know this is immoral.</i>

1192
01:23:36,707 --> 01:23:38,247
<i>But he is good to me.</i>

1193
01:23:39,286 --> 01:23:41,534
The shoes look better

1194
01:23:41,534 --> 01:23:42,743
when they're on your feet.

1195
01:23:44,449 --> 01:23:45,655
That would be $299.

1196
01:23:45,947 --> 01:23:46,946
It's expensive!

1197
01:23:47,653 --> 01:23:48,612
Wait, here's your change.

1198
01:23:48,612 --> 01:23:49,611
Keep the change.

1199
01:23:49,860 --> 01:23:51,608
Keep the rest as a tip.

1200
01:23:52,023 --> 01:23:54,688
Consider this my gift to you.

1201
01:23:55,604 --> 01:23:56,603
Thank you.

1202
01:23:56,936 --> 01:23:58,976
<i>If you can give me some advice,</i>

1203
01:23:59,725 --> 01:24:00,682
<i>I'd be grateful.</i>

1204
01:24:00,682 --> 01:24:01,681
Jie...

1205
01:24:01,973 --> 01:24:02,972
Please...

1206
01:24:07,550 --> 01:24:09,755
Don't you think she's lost her mind?

1207
01:24:10,504 --> 01:24:12,252
Why does she choose to be a hostess?

1208
01:24:12,752 --> 01:24:13,544
For dirty money?

1209
01:24:13,545 --> 01:24:15,209
Is it worth it to sacrifice
your feelings?

1210
01:24:16,748 --> 01:24:17,582
Jie, please...

1211
01:24:17,582 --> 01:24:18,581
calm down first.

1212
01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:20,703
He might not be a lowlife!

1213
01:24:20,704 --> 01:24:21,243
Right.

1214
01:24:21,661 --> 01:24:23,741
We don't know everything, right?

1215
01:24:23,741 --> 01:24:25,180
- You...
- Xiao Bo, write to her.

1216
01:24:25,948 --> 01:24:26,947
Come here.

1217
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,528
Write down what I say, word for word.

1218
01:24:32,275 --> 01:24:33,274
Write!

1219
01:24:33,356 --> 01:24:34,854
Now you're fine with writing back?

1220
01:24:35,564 --> 01:24:37,145
You said it wouldn't make a difference.

1221
01:24:39,225 --> 01:24:40,557
I just want to rebuke her,

1222
01:24:40,558 --> 01:24:41,557
can't I?

1223
01:24:50,463 --> 01:24:51,703
<i>I think you have misunderstood.</i>

1224
01:24:51,962 --> 01:24:54,128
<i>I'm not doing this because of vanity.</i>

1225
01:24:54,834 --> 01:24:56,375
<i>I need to take care of my family.</i>

1226
01:24:57,331 --> 01:24:58,830
<i>They can barely make ends meet.</i>

1227
01:24:59,454 --> 01:25:00,913
<i>I make good money being a hostess,</i>

1228
01:25:01,287 --> 01:25:02,326
<i>but not all the time.</i>

1229
01:25:03,535 --> 01:25:04,948
<i>The man said</i>

1230
01:25:04,948 --> 01:25:06,615
<i>he could open a shop for me.</i>

1231
01:25:06,865 --> 01:25:08,302
<i>In the shopping mall he's investing in.</i>

1232
01:25:09,237 --> 01:25:11,402
<i>I've saved up some money,</i>

1233
01:25:12,191 --> 01:25:14,607
<i>and have been waiting for
an opportunity like this.</i>

1234
01:25:20,226 --> 01:25:22,390
Sis, where are the flowers?

1235
01:25:22,391 --> 01:25:23,554
If you water them with love,

1236
01:25:24,179 --> 01:25:25,552
flowers will bloom.

1237
01:25:28,218 --> 01:25:33,088
Over here...

1238
01:25:33,337 --> 01:25:34,959
I think she is shameless.

1239
01:25:34,961 --> 01:25:35,917
Maybe she is like us,

1240
01:25:35,918 --> 01:25:37,581
unable to find a decent job.

1241
01:25:37,583 --> 01:25:38,623
Can't find a decent job?

1242
01:25:38,624 --> 01:25:40,830
I'd be a pauper before a madame.

1243
01:25:41,536 --> 01:25:42,535
Xiao Bo, write.

1244
01:25:42,745 --> 01:25:44,743
Tell her that the man must be a crook.

1245
01:25:44,993 --> 01:25:46,156
What if he is genuine,

1246
01:25:46,156 --> 01:25:47,316
and helps her open a shop,

1247
01:25:48,029 --> 01:25:49,943
then she won't need to be a hostess.

1248
01:25:49,945 --> 01:25:51,026
Then you tell her:

1249
01:25:51,401 --> 01:25:53,399
If the man starts asking for money,

1250
01:25:53,399 --> 01:25:54,483
he is definitely a cheat.

1251
01:25:54,815 --> 01:25:58,229
Everybody knows Causeway Bay is my turf.

1252
01:25:59,685 --> 01:26:00,684
Right.

1253
01:26:02,225 --> 01:26:06,261
Make sure the fund hits my
Hong Kong account soon.

1254
01:26:07,345 --> 01:26:08,344
Good.

1255
01:26:10,132 --> 01:26:11,131
Sure, no problem.

1256
01:26:11,548 --> 01:26:13,214
I'll treat you to dim sum when I return.

1257
01:26:14,046 --> 01:26:15,045
Okay.

1258
01:26:15,626 --> 01:26:18,084
I have so many deals to do lately.

1259
01:26:20,539 --> 01:26:21,538
Oh, yes.

1260
01:26:22,204 --> 01:26:23,203
About the shop,

1261
01:26:23,203 --> 01:26:24,783
I have arranged everything for you.

1262
01:26:24,785 --> 01:26:25,784
Already?

1263
01:26:25,826 --> 01:26:26,825
Moreover,

1264
01:26:27,324 --> 01:26:28,404
overhead

1265
01:26:28,406 --> 01:26:29,528
utilities,

1266
01:26:29,530 --> 01:26:31,278
product sourcing...

1267
01:26:31,945 --> 01:26:34,107
I'll handle all of that.

1268
01:26:34,941 --> 01:26:35,481
And you

1269
01:26:35,482 --> 01:26:37,272
just need to put up 70,000

1270
01:26:37,772 --> 01:26:38,812
for the rent.

1271
01:26:39,312 --> 01:26:40,686
Then we're all set.

1272
01:26:42,349 --> 01:26:43,348
Err...

1273
01:26:43,847 --> 01:26:45,012
You need 70,000?

1274
01:26:45,014 --> 01:26:46,345
70,000 is not a lot.

1275
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:50,259
Don't you know?

1276
01:26:50,384 --> 01:26:53,173
Of all the shops in the mall

1277
01:26:53,962 --> 01:26:55,460
this one has the best location.

1278
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:57,376
In order to secure this shop,

1279
01:26:57,751 --> 01:26:59,331
I've already...

1280
01:26:59,999 --> 01:27:01,997
spent hundreds of thousands.

1281
01:27:03,245 --> 01:27:04,037
<i>Remember</i>

1282
01:27:04,037 --> 01:27:05,618
<i>No matter how nicely he puts it.</i>

1283
01:27:06,035 --> 01:27:07,158
<i>Once he asks you for money,</i>

1284
01:27:07,491 --> 01:27:08,782
<i>he is a con artist.</i>

1285
01:27:10,195 --> 01:27:11,362
<i>Go out and ask around.</i>

1286
01:27:11,694 --> 01:27:13,277
<i>Is the shop for real?</i>

1287
01:27:14,526 --> 01:27:16,149
Where's the shop that was here before?

1288
01:27:16,524 --> 01:27:17,773
It went bust.

1289
01:27:18,187 --> 01:27:20,353
I took over a few days ago.

1290
01:27:24,181 --> 01:27:27,053
<i>If your heart is tired</i>

1291
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:31,342
<i>tears have run dry.</i>

1292
01:27:32,383 --> 01:27:38,252
<i>This profound love</i>

1293
01:27:38,834 --> 01:27:45,160
<i>is hard to forget or end.</i>

1294
01:27:46,119 --> 01:27:49,364
<i>But I don't see you anymore.</i>

1295
01:27:49,365 --> 01:27:50,364
Sit down.

1296
01:27:53,444 --> 01:27:55,192
Are you Zhang Long?

1297
01:27:58,814 --> 01:27:59,813
Who?

1298
01:28:00,187 --> 01:28:01,186
My surname is Su,

1299
01:28:01,478 --> 01:28:02,477
not Zhang.

1300
01:28:03,059 --> 01:28:04,183
I ask you one more time.

1301
01:28:04,433 --> 01:28:05,888
Are you Zhang Long?

1302
01:28:07,846 --> 01:28:09,510
Mind your attitude.

1303
01:28:09,927 --> 01:28:11,633
I am a Hong Kong citizen.

1304
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:14,839
Scum!

1305
01:28:15,671 --> 01:28:16,670
You can't fool me!

1306
01:28:17,337 --> 01:28:18,336
Don't move.

1307
01:28:20,334 --> 01:28:20,998
Big brother.

1308
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:22,207
What's going on?

1309
01:28:22,207 --> 01:28:23,371
What's your name?

1310
01:28:25,037 --> 01:28:26,410
Let's be civil and talk...

1311
01:28:27,576 --> 01:28:28,076
Hold still!

1312
01:28:28,076 --> 01:28:28,865
Where are you taking us?

1313
01:28:28,866 --> 01:28:30,279
We did nothing!

1314
01:28:30,281 --> 01:28:34,525
<i>Why are you here to stir up my heartbeat.</i>

1315
01:28:34,527 --> 01:28:38,480
<i>How can I stop loving you?</i>

1316
01:28:50,011 --> 01:28:51,635
Why are you so indifferent?

1317
01:28:51,966 --> 01:28:52,965
According to the notice,

1318
01:28:53,175 --> 01:28:55,338
the store revives from
midnight till dawn.

1319
01:28:55,962 --> 01:28:57,211
If I am not mistaken,

1320
01:28:57,211 --> 01:28:58,572
the portal will close at daybreak.

1321
01:29:02,915 --> 01:29:04,079
<i>You were right about him.</i>

1322
01:29:04,454 --> 01:29:05,620
<i>He was in fact a con man.</i>

1323
01:29:06,245 --> 01:29:08,160
<i>But I now feel even more lost.</i>

1324
01:29:08,449 --> 01:29:09,783
<i>Other than being a hostess,</i>

1325
01:29:10,116 --> 01:29:11,115
<i>I really don't know</i>

1326
01:29:11,446 --> 01:29:13,362
<i>how else I can support my family.</i>

1327
01:29:14,653 --> 01:29:15,652
She believed in us.

1328
01:29:16,776 --> 01:29:17,775
We helped her.

1329
01:29:18,857 --> 01:29:19,648
We helped her.

1330
01:29:19,648 --> 01:29:20,687
Why aren't you happy?

1331
01:29:21,105 --> 01:29:22,103
What for?

1332
01:29:22,104 --> 01:29:23,434
Now she's even more lost.

1333
01:29:25,018 --> 01:29:25,432
Well...

1334
01:29:25,892 --> 01:29:28,179
What more can we do?

1335
01:29:30,137 --> 01:29:31,219
How would I know?

1336
01:29:33,342 --> 01:29:34,548
Which year is it over there?

1337
01:29:39,792 --> 01:29:41,166
Grab a pen and some paper.

1338
01:29:41,459 --> 01:29:42,458
Hurry.

1339
01:29:47,994 --> 01:29:50,531
In fact, like you...

1340
01:29:54,820 --> 01:29:57,025
<i>Lowlives like him exist in all ages.</i>

1341
01:29:57,567 --> 01:29:58,816
<i>Don't feel bad about it.</i>

1342
01:29:59,233 --> 01:30:00,356
<i>In fact, like you</i>

1343
01:30:00,771 --> 01:30:01,770
<i>I am totally lost.</i>

1344
01:30:02,269 --> 01:30:03,311
<i>But I want to tell you,</i>

1345
01:30:03,728 --> 01:30:04,727
<i>no matter what,</i>

1346
01:30:04,935 --> 01:30:06,453
<i>don't even think of
relying on anyone else.</i>

1347
01:30:06,975 --> 01:30:08,638
<i>You have to rely on yourself.</i>

1348
01:30:09,430 --> 01:30:10,511
<i>I can't tell you</i>

1349
01:30:10,511 --> 01:30:12,384
<i>how to become financially independent.</i>

1350
01:30:12,677 --> 01:30:15,006
<i>But being a hostess is not the way out.</i>

1351
01:30:15,799 --> 01:30:17,297
<i>Maybe it's hard for you to imagine</i>

1352
01:30:17,547 --> 01:30:20,501
<i>in the future, people will
stop writing letters like this.</i>

1353
01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:22,843
<i>The proliferation of
computers and the Internet</i>

1354
01:30:22,998 --> 01:30:24,665
<i>will shrink our world.</i>

1355
01:30:24,956 --> 01:30:26,245
<i>The advent of social networks</i>

1356
01:30:26,620 --> 01:30:28,578
<i>will make communication much easier.</i>

1357
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:31,075
<i>We don't even need to use cash.</i>

1358
01:30:31,574 --> 01:30:32,573
<i>A cell phone</i>

1359
01:30:32,656 --> 01:30:34,861
<i>can handle all of our daily needs.</i>

1360
01:30:35,361 --> 01:30:38,607
<i>In 20 years, China's
economy will flourish.</i>

1361
01:30:39,067 --> 01:30:42,896
<i>Stocks, real estate, IT,
Internet, e-commerce...</i>

1362
01:30:43,270 --> 01:30:45,560
<i>These industries will
develop at light speed.</i>

1363
01:30:46,224 --> 01:30:48,263
<i>If you study hard now,</i>

1364
01:30:48,265 --> 01:30:49,930
<i>save up and invest,</i>

1365
01:30:49,931 --> 01:30:50,930
<i>be a first mover,</i>

1366
01:30:51,137 --> 01:30:52,575
<i>the better your chances of success are.</i>

1367
01:30:53,011 --> 01:30:54,091
I have no idea

1368
01:30:55,258 --> 01:30:56,338
what happened to her since.

1369
01:30:56,549 --> 01:30:57,548
You tried your best.

1370
01:30:58,087 --> 01:30:59,129
Let it be.

1371
01:31:10,118 --> 01:31:11,739
We've received letters from the past.

1372
01:31:11,741 --> 01:31:13,115
But the notice invites

1373
01:31:13,571 --> 01:31:15,654
people from 2017 to write in.

1374
01:31:16,903 --> 01:31:17,902
If...

1375
01:31:18,484 --> 01:31:19,483
What?

1376
01:31:20,857 --> 01:31:22,687
If we drop a letter from the front,

1377
01:31:23,479 --> 01:31:24,770
will it travel back 20 years?

1378
01:31:26,269 --> 01:31:27,392
Do we still have time?

1379
01:31:29,723 --> 01:31:30,554
Stop debating,

1380
01:31:30,555 --> 01:31:31,762
we'll know after we tried.

1381
01:31:31,763 --> 01:31:32,177
Quick.

1382
01:31:32,177 --> 01:31:33,136
Get a blank page.

1383
01:31:33,136 --> 01:31:34,135
Blank sheet.

1384
01:31:36,466 --> 01:31:37,465
Hurry up.

1385
01:31:38,089 --> 01:31:39,088
Hurry up.

1386
01:31:43,251 --> 01:31:44,750
It went through.

1387
01:31:46,663 --> 01:31:49,076
I really want to know what 1993 was like.

1388
01:31:49,078 --> 01:31:50,534
And what these people looked like.

1389
01:31:53,156 --> 01:31:54,155
It's morning now.

1390
01:31:58,735 --> 01:31:59,734
The portal is closed.

1391
01:32:12,346 --> 01:32:13,720
No more letters.

1392
01:32:14,509 --> 01:32:15,508
So...

1393
01:32:16,757 --> 01:32:17,756
let's go.

1394
01:32:19,214 --> 01:32:20,213
Where to?

1395
01:32:34,574 --> 01:32:35,573
Where did it go?

1396
01:32:38,570 --> 01:32:39,569
What is this?

1397
01:32:46,395 --> 01:32:47,394
Look!

1398
01:32:53,055 --> 01:32:54,178
<i>Namiya store,</i>

1399
01:32:54,179 --> 01:32:55,178
<i>greetings!</i>

1400
01:32:55,385 --> 01:32:57,424
<i>I am The Lost Wang Wang</i>

1401
01:32:57,425 --> 01:32:59,963
<i>who wrote you in the winter of 1993.</i>

1402
01:33:00,922 --> 01:33:03,375
<i>Your advice changed my life.</i>

1403
01:33:03,377 --> 01:33:05,667
Fixed assets.

1404
01:33:05,957 --> 01:33:06,791
Young lady,

1405
01:33:06,791 --> 01:33:07,790
tell me,

1406
01:33:08,164 --> 01:33:09,163
what's your major?

1407
01:33:09,288 --> 01:33:10,412
Do you have a major?

1408
01:33:10,994 --> 01:33:12,366
Don't you have a major?

1409
01:33:12,368 --> 01:33:13,742
What do you study?

1410
01:33:13,991 --> 01:33:14,698
Accounting.

1411
01:33:14,699 --> 01:33:16,780
Yes, your major is accounting.

1412
01:33:17,195 --> 01:33:19,568
My major is accounting.

1413
01:33:20,235 --> 01:33:22,899
<i>Study, save up and invest</i>

1414
01:33:23,648 --> 01:33:24,980
<i>I did not forget any of them.</i>

1415
01:33:30,766 --> 01:33:32,055
<i>I did loads of research,</i>

1416
01:33:32,554 --> 01:33:34,034
<i>invested wisely in technology stocks,</i>

1417
01:33:34,346 --> 01:33:35,594
<i>and accumulated some cash.</i>

1418
01:33:36,011 --> 01:33:37,488
<i>I kept pace with the national policy.</i>

1419
01:33:38,174 --> 01:33:40,421
<i>I soon bought my first property,</i>

1420
01:33:41,131 --> 01:33:44,167
<i>then my second and third.</i>

1421
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:45,916
<i>Just as I'd wished,</i>

1422
01:33:45,917 --> 01:33:48,288
<i>I bought my late foster
parents' house too.</i>

1423
01:33:49,080 --> 01:33:50,870
<i>In the future that you described,</i>

1424
01:33:50,871 --> 01:33:52,869
<i>I seem to have made all the right moves.</i>

1425
01:33:58,696 --> 01:33:59,695
<i>In time,</i>

1426
01:33:59,861 --> 01:34:01,068
<i>I left my hometown</i>

1427
01:34:01,610 --> 01:34:02,941
<i>and set up my own company.</i>

1428
01:34:03,566 --> 01:34:04,771
<i>I am still learning</i>

1429
01:34:05,396 --> 01:34:07,229
<i>to turn risks into opportunities.</i>

1430
01:34:07,893 --> 01:34:09,433
<i>From a simple food court</i>

1431
01:34:09,435 --> 01:34:11,140
<i>to the latest housing developments,</i>

1432
01:34:11,557 --> 01:34:13,056
<i>I've yet to lose a battle.</i>

1433
01:34:14,097 --> 01:34:16,509
<i>Those awesome prophecies that you made</i>

1434
01:34:16,884 --> 01:34:18,093
<i>are all coming true.</i>

1435
01:34:20,340 --> 01:34:21,379
<i>Now I think of it,</i>

1436
01:34:22,004 --> 01:34:24,045
<i>life is truly a miracle.</i>

1437
01:34:25,418 --> 01:34:26,417
Come in.

1438
01:34:27,124 --> 01:34:28,123
President.

1439
01:34:28,332 --> 01:34:29,040
What is it?

1440
01:34:29,289 --> 01:34:30,329
We've been invited

1441
01:34:30,330 --> 01:34:31,412
by Binhai's North District

1442
01:34:31,869 --> 01:34:33,910
to bid for an urban renewal project.

1443
01:34:34,491 --> 01:34:35,490
Binhai?

1444
01:34:36,074 --> 01:34:37,073
Your hometown.

1445
01:34:37,738 --> 01:34:38,737
Please take a look.

1446
01:34:38,986 --> 01:34:41,234
This is the tender document.

1447
01:34:42,483 --> 01:34:43,482
Also,

1448
01:34:44,191 --> 01:34:45,979
this is our research.

1449
01:34:47,063 --> 01:34:48,062
Please review it.

1450
01:34:52,098 --> 01:34:53,390
<i>I don't know if you remember</i>

1451
01:34:53,931 --> 01:34:55,554
<i>the reason I wanted money</i>

1452
01:34:55,887 --> 01:34:57,218
<i>was to support my big family.</i>

1453
01:34:58,052 --> 01:34:59,799
<i>When I heard that the House of Rainbow</i>

1454
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:02,797
<i>was zoned for urban renewal,</i>

1455
01:35:03,586 --> 01:35:04,753
<i>I decided to go for it.</i>

1456
01:35:05,085 --> 01:35:08,042
<i>I'll do my utmost to secure this project.</i>

1457
01:35:09,041 --> 01:35:10,829
<i>I want to tear it down and rebuild it.</i>

1458
01:35:11,953 --> 01:35:12,412
Mr. Chen,

1459
01:35:12,787 --> 01:35:13,826
prepare our offer at once.

1460
01:35:14,076 --> 01:35:15,367
We must win this bid.

1461
01:35:22,941 --> 01:35:23,940
Ms. Zhang,

1462
01:35:24,025 --> 01:35:25,814
since you grew up in
the House of Rainbows,

1463
01:35:25,814 --> 01:35:27,562
what do you plan to do with it?

1464
01:35:28,186 --> 01:35:29,395
Ms. Zhang...

1465
01:35:34,972 --> 01:35:35,971
How do you do?

1466
01:35:44,338 --> 01:35:45,337
Brother Yi.

1467
01:35:45,668 --> 01:35:46,168
Xiao Mei.

1468
01:35:46,460 --> 01:35:47,459
Long time no see.

1469
01:35:47,709 --> 01:35:48,708
Welcome.

1470
01:35:49,083 --> 01:35:50,082
Let me introduce,

1471
01:35:51,248 --> 01:35:52,996
Madam Zhang's niece.

1472
01:35:53,578 --> 01:35:54,619
I'm Zhang Qing Mei.

1473
01:35:55,119 --> 01:35:56,076
Nice to meet you.

1474
01:35:56,077 --> 01:35:58,198
Thanks for taking this place over.

1475
01:35:58,948 --> 01:35:59,864
You're welcome.

1476
01:35:59,864 --> 01:36:01,152
I lived here

1477
01:36:01,152 --> 01:36:02,235
when my foster parents passed away.

1478
01:36:02,236 --> 01:36:03,796
The House of Rainbows is always my home.

1479
01:36:04,149 --> 01:36:04,942
Don't worry.

1480
01:36:04,943 --> 01:36:06,460
I will take good care of the children.

1481
01:36:06,815 --> 01:36:07,814
I'm grateful.

1482
01:36:08,395 --> 01:36:10,977
Madam Zhang left these behind.

1483
01:36:25,128 --> 01:36:26,711
That's a young Madam Zhang?

1484
01:36:27,211 --> 01:36:28,210
So pretty!

1485
01:36:29,541 --> 01:36:30,790
He's handsome, too.

1486
01:36:31,122 --> 01:36:32,121
Who was he?

1487
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:33,953
I heard from elder relatives,

1488
01:36:33,954 --> 01:36:35,159
when my aunt was young

1489
01:36:35,161 --> 01:36:36,398
she fell in love with this man.

1490
01:36:36,409 --> 01:36:37,740
The family was against it.

1491
01:36:37,740 --> 01:36:39,198
They even planned to elope.

1492
01:36:39,448 --> 01:36:41,028
But my aunt's family locked her in.

1493
01:36:41,030 --> 01:36:42,653
They've lost contact since.

1494
01:36:43,777 --> 01:36:45,942
No wonder Madam Zhang never got married.

1495
01:36:46,441 --> 01:36:47,440
What a pity!

1496
01:36:49,063 --> 01:36:50,770
So what has happened to this man?

1497
01:36:51,851 --> 01:36:53,808
My grandpa said he'd met him once.

1498
01:36:53,809 --> 01:36:55,013
He was a gentleman.

1499
01:36:55,015 --> 01:36:56,805
He'd written once to my aunt.

1500
01:36:57,555 --> 01:36:58,719
Could this be that letter?

1501
01:37:00,552 --> 01:37:01,756
In his letter,

1502
01:37:01,758 --> 01:37:04,298
he asked my aunt to move on without him.

1503
01:37:04,712 --> 01:37:06,461
After receiving this letter,

1504
01:37:07,128 --> 01:37:08,626
my aunt decided never to marry.

1505
01:37:09,043 --> 01:37:10,831
She bought this place

1506
01:37:11,124 --> 01:37:13,204
and spent the rest of her life here.

1507
01:37:13,871 --> 01:37:15,948
The man has moved away,
no one heard from him since.

1508
01:37:16,036 --> 01:37:17,867
They haven't seen each other again.

1509
01:37:20,032 --> 01:37:21,114
"No Name..."

1510
01:37:24,068 --> 01:37:25,609
<i>During the transition,</i>

1511
01:37:26,150 --> 01:37:27,398
<i>I accidentally stumbled across</i>

1512
01:37:27,399 --> 01:37:30,229
<i>the story of you and Madam Zhang.</i>

1513
01:37:48,043 --> 01:37:49,042
Be careful.

1514
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:58,243
<i>Madam Zhang founded
the House of Rainbows.</i>

1515
01:37:58,992 --> 01:38:01,280
<i>I became what I am today</i>

1516
01:38:01,529 --> 01:38:02,988
<i>because of your advice back then.</i>

1517
01:38:04,237 --> 01:38:06,692
<i>And I can now repay
the House of Rainbows.</i>

1518
01:38:09,689 --> 01:38:12,603
<i>I feel that you are
both watching over us,</i>

1519
01:38:13,142 --> 01:38:15,099
<i>so I can grow up in a loving environment,</i>

1520
01:38:15,100 --> 01:38:17,388
<i>with all my brothers and sisters.</i>

1521
01:38:17,888 --> 01:38:20,053
<i>Madam Zhang devoted her life</i>

1522
01:38:20,635 --> 01:38:22,593
<i>in providing shelter for
dozens of children.</i>

1523
01:38:23,175 --> 01:38:24,174
<i>And you,</i>

1524
01:38:24,216 --> 01:38:27,795
<i>you showed me how to be benevolent,</i>

1525
01:38:28,127 --> 01:38:30,043
<i>when I can think only of myself,</i>

1526
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:32,123
<i>and neglecting the feelings of others.</i>

1527
01:38:32,872 --> 01:38:34,580
<i>Thank you for giving me advice.</i>

1528
01:38:34,955 --> 01:38:36,661
<i>The fact that I have not repaid you</i>

1529
01:38:37,286 --> 01:38:39,116
<i>is my greatest regret.</i>

1530
01:38:39,116 --> 01:38:40,115
<i>From now on,</i>

1531
01:38:40,408 --> 01:38:41,863
<i>I endeavor to help more people.</i>

1532
01:38:42,447 --> 01:38:43,904
<i>From up above,</i>

1533
01:38:44,154 --> 01:38:45,859
<i>I hope you can feel my aspirations.</i>

1534
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:48,606
The Lost Wang Wang

1535
01:38:50,604 --> 01:38:51,688
is in fact Zhang Qing Mei.

1536
01:38:52,063 --> 01:38:53,686
She's not closing down
the House of Rainbows.

1537
01:38:56,059 --> 01:38:57,182
We were wrong about her.

1538
01:38:59,970 --> 01:39:00,968
Xiao Bo.

1539
01:39:01,261 --> 01:39:02,260
What's wrong, Xiao Bo?

1540
01:39:02,302 --> 01:39:03,301
Say something.

1541
01:39:04,008 --> 01:39:05,424
Brother Xiao Bo.

1542
01:39:06,298 --> 01:39:07,297
Xiao Bo.

1543
01:39:07,961 --> 01:39:08,960
Xiao Bo.

1544
01:39:09,170 --> 01:39:10,999
Uncle Yi asked us to
bring Xiao Bo with us,

1545
01:39:11,001 --> 01:39:11,957
but he wouldn't come out.

1546
01:39:11,957 --> 01:39:12,874
Xiao Bo.

1547
01:39:12,875 --> 01:39:14,788
He hasn't eaten all day.

1548
01:39:14,789 --> 01:39:16,162
Kids, you go down first.

1549
01:39:16,163 --> 01:39:16,745
Kids, you go down first.

1550
01:39:16,745 --> 01:39:17,744
Watch your step.

1551
01:39:18,036 --> 01:39:19,160
Watch out for the steps.

1552
01:39:19,824 --> 01:39:20,159
Xiao Bo.

1553
01:39:20,783 --> 01:39:21,782
Xiao Bo.

1554
01:39:23,820 --> 01:39:25,986
Xiao Bo, are you okay?

1555
01:39:26,442 --> 01:39:27,941
Everyone has left.

1556
01:39:28,358 --> 01:39:29,357
Let's go, okay?

1557
01:39:30,773 --> 01:39:31,772
Pull yourself together!

1558
01:39:32,561 --> 01:39:33,560
What do you want?

1559
01:39:34,477 --> 01:39:35,933
My biological parents abandoned me.

1560
01:39:35,933 --> 01:39:37,265
My foster parents didn't want me.

1561
01:39:37,266 --> 01:39:38,555
Now even the House of Rainbows

1562
01:39:38,555 --> 01:39:40,388
is going to be
demolished by Zhang Qing Mei.

1563
01:39:43,218 --> 01:39:44,383
Don't they want to tear it down?

1564
01:39:44,384 --> 01:39:46,422
They can bury me in the rubble.

1565
01:39:46,422 --> 01:39:47,796
I can help them tear it down!

1566
01:39:49,419 --> 01:39:50,003
Watch me!

1567
01:39:50,003 --> 01:39:50,503
Xiao Bo.

1568
01:39:50,503 --> 01:39:51,377
Damn it...

1569
01:39:51,377 --> 01:39:52,166
Xiao Bo.

1570
01:39:52,166 --> 01:39:53,165
Xiao Bo

1571
01:39:53,208 --> 01:39:54,289
I order you to calm down.

1572
01:39:54,707 --> 01:39:55,706
Are you crazy?

1573
01:39:58,535 --> 01:39:59,534
Tell us what you want.

1574
01:39:59,868 --> 01:40:01,407
We're with you all the way, okay?

1575
01:40:01,407 --> 01:40:02,727
If she wants to demolish Rainbows,

1576
01:40:03,614 --> 01:40:03,989
fine!

1577
01:40:04,528 --> 01:40:05,652
We will trash her house.

1578
01:40:13,354 --> 01:40:14,062
Hold still!

1579
01:40:14,063 --> 01:40:15,683
Don't move, hear me?

1580
01:40:15,685 --> 01:40:16,684
You've got nerves.

1581
01:40:17,265 --> 01:40:18,264
You've got nerves.

1582
01:40:22,054 --> 01:40:24,676
It's sad the letter never
reached the old man.

1583
01:40:26,174 --> 01:40:27,755
The letter was intended for us.

1584
01:40:32,625 --> 01:40:34,416
There seems to be an invisible force

1585
01:40:36,206 --> 01:40:39,118
linking Rainbows to this store.

1586
01:40:42,240 --> 01:40:43,239
Let's go.

1587
01:41:13,043 --> 01:41:14,042
I've decided.

1588
01:41:14,999 --> 01:41:15,998
I'll go and sign up.

1589
01:41:22,908 --> 01:41:23,907
Are you confident?

1590
01:41:30,690 --> 01:41:31,689
How about Xiao Bo?

1591
01:41:42,513 --> 01:41:43,970
I want to go to Qing Mei's house.

1592
01:41:44,719 --> 01:41:45,843
If possible,

1593
01:41:46,549 --> 01:41:48,882
I hope to have her forgiveness.

1594
01:41:52,461 --> 01:41:53,460
And you?

1595
01:41:54,751 --> 01:41:55,750
Me?

1596
01:41:57,748 --> 01:41:59,204
Let's go find Qing Mei first.

1597
01:42:18,017 --> 01:42:19,016
To Blank Page.

1598
01:42:22,472 --> 01:42:24,346
To Blank Page.

1599
01:42:24,970 --> 01:42:26,426
<i>I am getting old.</i>

1600
01:42:27,008 --> 01:42:28,299
<i>I thought long and hard</i>

1601
01:42:29,091 --> 01:42:32,627
<i>before I realized why you sent me this.</i>

1602
01:42:33,919 --> 01:42:36,208
<i>Maybe I'm becoming senile.</i>

1603
01:42:37,582 --> 01:42:40,662
<i>My guess is that you
didn't know what to ask.</i>

1604
01:42:41,703 --> 01:42:43,491
<i>For those who sought my advice</i>

1605
01:42:44,615 --> 01:42:46,781
<i>they usually had specific questions.</i>

1606
01:42:47,530 --> 01:42:48,611
<i>Or, should I say,</i>

1607
01:42:49,445 --> 01:42:52,731
<i>they already come with their own maps.</i>

1608
01:42:53,690 --> 01:42:55,272
<i>But in most cases,</i>

1609
01:42:56,063 --> 01:42:58,019
<i>they had no idea where they were.</i>

1610
01:42:59,143 --> 01:43:02,140
<i>But you sent only a blank page.</i>

1611
01:43:03,389 --> 01:43:06,218
<i>This shows you didn't have a map.</i>

1612
01:43:07,466 --> 01:43:09,339
<i>This is indeed disturbing.</i>

1613
01:43:11,256 --> 01:43:13,503
<i>But what I want to share with you is,</i>

1614
01:43:14,419 --> 01:43:17,125
<i>after counseling so many people</i>

1615
01:43:17,999 --> 01:43:18,955
<i>I discovered that</i>

1616
01:43:18,956 --> 01:43:21,452
<i>one must still work hard</i>

1617
01:43:22,201 --> 01:43:24,492
<i>in order to attain a better life.</i>

1618
01:43:25,783 --> 01:43:27,114
<i>The advice I gave in my letters</i>

1619
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:30,028
<i>only meant to reinforce</i>

1620
01:43:30,611 --> 01:43:32,484
<i>an already determined heart.</i>

1621
01:43:34,938 --> 01:43:36,729
<i>The good thing about a blank page</i>

1622
01:43:37,810 --> 01:43:42,598
<i>is you can freely draw your own.</i>

1623
01:43:43,473 --> 01:43:44,472
<i>That is to say,</i>

1624
01:43:45,428 --> 01:43:49,217
<i>your future is your own.</i>

1625
01:43:50,465 --> 01:43:52,588
<i>Now go and draw your own map.</i>

1626
01:43:53,379 --> 01:43:56,459
<i>I sincerely hope you
have faith in yourself.</i>

1627
01:43:57,126 --> 01:43:58,539
<i>Create without fear and...</i>

1628
01:43:59,082 --> 01:44:00,287
<i>sparkle!</i>

1629
01:44:01,122 --> 01:44:03,909
<i>This is the last reply I write.</i>

1630
01:44:04,576 --> 01:44:05,575
<i>Thank you.</i>
