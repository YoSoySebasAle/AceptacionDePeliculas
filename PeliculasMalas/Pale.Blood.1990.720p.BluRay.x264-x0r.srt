Now, I don't wanna
bother you with detail...

6
00:00:22,767 --> 00:00:25,270
Mr. Oswald, will you
please hold still?

7
00:00:25,604 --> 00:00:28,857
Now, as I was saying, I don't
wanna bother you with details

8
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:32,319
on how I arrived at this, just
let me say that it is a work

9
00:00:32,652 --> 00:00:35,238

of true commitment,

10
00:00:35,572 --> 00:00:39,242
and years and years of
single-minded dedication.

11
00:00:39,576 --> 00:00:41,786
Mr. Oswald, if you
can't stop shaking,

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,040
I will have to ask
you to leave the room.

13
00:00:45,373 --> 00:00:46,458
Gentlemen.

14
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:47,876

have a message from Lori,

45
00:02:57,047 --> 00:02:59,049
who says she's from
the Detective Agency?

46
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,010
- Yes.

47
00:03:02,344 --> 00:03:03,386
- [Woman] She's unable to
meet you but asked that

48
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,723
you join her at Metropolis,
a store on Melrose Avenue?

49
00:03:07,057 --> 00:03:08,516
Do you know where that is?

50
00:03:10,518 --> 00:03:11,770
- I'll find it.

51
00:03:13,146 --> 00:03:14,314
- Have you got your passport?
(woman chuckles)

52
00:03:14,647 --> 00:03:16,399
- That's the fifth time
you've asked me that.

53
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:18,151
- Remember when you tried to
go to Missouri and you left--

54
00:03:18,485 --> 00:03:23,239
- Yes, yes, yes.

Vampire city, come
on, let's do it.

68
00:05:17,145 --> 00:05:18,061
Get me some light.

00:05:18,062 --> 00:05:21,024
Oh, wow.

70
00:05:23,526 --> 00:05:25,653
All right, come on in tight.

and open up to include me.

73
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:32,285
Get him outta here, will ya?

74
00:05:32,619 --> 00:05:33,912
- [Officer] Police, move aside.

75
00:05:34,245 --> 00:05:36,039
- This is Frazer Kelly, I'm
reporting live from Metropolis

76
00:05:36,372 --> 00:05:38,291
a Melrose Avenue lingerie
boutique and a scene

77
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,419
of yet another grizzly
feast by the vampire killer.

78
00:05:41,753 --> 00:05:44,214
Less than 10 minutes ago,
I received an anonymous tip

79
00:05:44,547 --> 00:05:47,217
at the Channel 3 news desk.

80
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:50,011
The shocking tip told me
that one of the mannequins

81
00:05:50,345 --> 00:05:52,347
was not a mannequin
at all, but a corpse,

82
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,226
and very likely the vampire
killer's victim number three.

83
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:58,102
We've arrived here
before the police

84
00:05:58,436 --> 00:05:59,645
to bring you this exclusive.

85
00:05:59,646 --> 00:06:02,106
- You must be Michael Fury.

86
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,441
I'm Lori, from the agency.

87
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,944
The one you've been
corresponding with.

88
00:06:06,277 --> 00:06:08,321
I'm really sorry I couldn't
meet you at the airport.

89
00:06:08,655 --> 00:06:09,989
I got a hot tip from
a friend of mine

90
00:06:10,323 --> 00:06:11,658
and I came right down here.

91
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:13,701
Looks like another one.

92
00:06:15,328 --> 00:06:17,372
(laughs) You are Michael
Fury, aren't you?

93
00:06:17,705 --> 00:06:19,332
The one who's been
paying me to investigate

94
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,544
these so-called vampire murders?

95
00:06:22,877 --> 00:06:24,170
- That's right.

96
00:06:24,504 --> 00:06:26,089
(Lori chuckles)

97
00:06:26,422 --> 00:06:28,758
- You had me scared
there for a minute.

98
00:06:29,092 --> 00:06:30,260
It's just like the others.

99
00:06:30,593 --> 00:06:32,637
Someone is using
sharpened incisors

100
00:06:32,971 --> 00:06:34,889
to bite into the
necks of the victims,

101
00:06:35,223 --> 00:06:36,474
and all the blood
is drained out.

102
00:06:36,808 --> 00:06:39,310
But there's no evidence,
there's never any evidence.

103
00:06:39,644 --> 00:06:40,602
- [Frazer] And they
appear no closer

104
00:06:40,603 --> 00:06:42,063
to solving the hideous crimes.

105
00:06:42,397 --> 00:06:43,564
- I see.
- Now, here tonight.

106
00:06:43,565 --> 00:06:44,566
Another victim.

107
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:46,234
This is Frazer Kelly
for Channel 3 News.

108
00:06:46,568 --> 00:06:47,610
Now back to the studio.

109
00:06:47,944 --> 00:06:49,279
- Well, my car is right here.

110
00:06:49,612 --> 00:06:51,072
Why don't I take
you to your condo?

111
00:06:51,406 --> 00:06:52,322
- [Woman] That really
freaked me out.

112
00:06:52,323 --> 00:06:53,324
I don't even wanna eat dinner.

113
00:06:53,658 --> 00:06:54,742
- [Man] I tell you, it
makes me worry about you

114
00:06:55,076 --> 00:06:56,369
walking out here by yourself.

115
00:06:56,703 --> 00:06:58,204
- [Woman] Don't think I'm
gonna work here anymore.

116
00:07:04,586 --> 00:07:07,463
(car engine starts)

117
00:07:25,607 --> 00:07:26,565
- Yes, ma'am?

118
00:07:26,566 --> 00:07:28,026
- Fill it up, please?

119
00:07:30,445 --> 00:07:34,407
And the victims are apparently
killed someplace else.

120
00:07:34,741 --> 00:07:36,284
Maybe the same place every time.

121
00:07:36,618 --> 00:07:38,703
And then they're brought to
the place where they're found

122
00:07:39,037 --> 00:07:41,122
and the rest you
know from my letters.

123
00:07:42,498 --> 00:07:43,833
You want a Coke?

124
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:47,795
Anyway, I found a great place
for you while you're here.

125
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:49,339
It's a brand new condo.

126
00:07:49,672 --> 00:07:50,839
(tires screech)
It's unfurnished.

127
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,508
That's what you
wanted, isn't it?

128
00:07:52,842 --> 00:07:54,302
- Have you seen it?

129
00:07:55,386 --> 00:07:58,473
- I spent a whole
day and night there.

130
00:07:58,806 --> 00:07:59,849
- Really?

131
00:08:00,183 --> 00:08:01,476
- Well, after all
our correspondence,

132
00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:03,853
I kinda felt like I knew you.

133
00:08:04,187 --> 00:08:08,149
- My letters were very
business-like, as I recall.

134
00:08:09,734 --> 00:08:12,487
- I know, (chuckles) but I
like to read between the lines.

135
00:08:14,989 --> 00:08:18,117
I made up a whole
personality for you.

136
00:08:21,537 --> 00:08:22,872
I sat in your place,

137
00:08:23,206 --> 00:08:25,625
wondering how you'd
decorate the living room,

138
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,877
which bedroom you'd
pick to sleep in,

139
00:08:28,211 --> 00:08:30,838
what your bed would look
like, things like that.

140
00:08:33,132 --> 00:08:35,259
- What do you do in the agency?

141
00:08:35,593 --> 00:08:37,845
- Research assistant
on the graveyard shift.

142
00:08:40,348 --> 00:08:43,643
- All those summaries you sent
me were unusually thorough.

143
00:08:43,976 --> 00:08:45,436
- Well, I'm very
interested in the occult.

144
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,563
Not just vampires,
a lot of things.

145
00:08:48,898 --> 00:08:51,359
Actually, I'm kind of a
joke around the office,

146
00:08:51,693 --> 00:08:54,362
so when your first letter
came in, they kinda thought--

147
00:08:54,696 --> 00:08:56,280
- They thought we
deserved each other.

148
00:08:56,614 --> 00:08:57,781
- I've read all
the vampire books.

149
00:08:57,782 --> 00:09:00,159
Seen just about every
vampire movie ever made.

150
00:09:00,493 --> 00:09:01,494
Wouldn't it be incredible
if there really was

151
00:09:01,828 --> 00:09:03,329
a vampire behind all this?

152
00:09:03,663 --> 00:09:04,914
You know, a lot of people
think it's possible.

153
00:09:05,248 --> 00:09:06,624
- Because of the puncture
wounds in the throats

154
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,209
of the three dead girls?

155
00:09:08,543 --> 00:09:09,877
- Well, you saw them.

156
00:09:10,211 --> 00:09:13,339
They looked just like fang
bites and everyone knows

157
00:09:13,673 --> 00:09:14,757
vampires must kill to live.

158
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:17,885
- I think people do
see too many movies.

159
00:09:18,219 --> 00:09:20,304
(ominous music)

160
00:09:20,638 --> 00:09:23,683
Why must what you
call a vampire kill?

161
00:09:24,016 --> 00:09:27,603
Why couldn't they take
just enough blood to exist?

162
00:09:27,937 --> 00:09:29,689
And let their quarry live.

163
00:09:30,022 --> 00:09:31,898
- Quarry?

164
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:34,318
That's an interesting
way of putting it.

165
00:09:34,652 --> 00:09:35,820
- I'm tired.

166
00:09:36,154 --> 00:09:38,656
I'd like to get
to the apartment.

167
00:09:43,494 --> 00:09:45,913
(door slams)

168
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:53,838
(car engine starts)

169
00:10:21,282 --> 00:10:24,826
- Michael?

170
00:10:24,827 --> 00:10:27,079
What are you really looking for?

171
00:10:27,413 --> 00:10:28,498
- I'm looking for a killer.

172
00:10:48,434 --> 00:10:51,312
(car engine starts)

173
00:10:58,027 --> 00:11:00,613
(sinister music)

174
00:11:59,213 --> 00:12:02,466
(muffled radio chatter)

175
00:12:09,432 --> 00:12:12,768
(muffled radio chatter)

176
00:12:15,605 --> 00:12:18,441
- Nice slow pan from
Billy Blue Shirt,

177
00:12:18,774 --> 00:12:19,859
and hold, beat.

178
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,445
Beat.

179
00:12:23,446 --> 00:12:27,617
Now nice slow zoom, real
slow, real slow, yeah.

180
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,201
That's good.

181
00:12:29,535 --> 00:12:31,369
Good.

182
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:40,670
Yeah.

183
00:12:40,671 --> 00:12:43,382
(ominous tones)

184
00:12:50,348 --> 00:12:53,517
Now, pull back real
slow, yes, real slow.

185
00:12:55,686 --> 00:12:58,648
Hell, somethin' moved
down there, I know it did.

186
00:13:03,152 --> 00:13:06,072
(strong wind blows)

187
00:13:14,413 --> 00:13:15,706
- [Michael] Looking
for something?

188
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,542
- Jesus Christ, man, you
scared the shit outta me.

189
00:13:18,876 --> 00:13:19,877
Are you a cop?

190
00:13:22,463 --> 00:13:23,547
Are you a cop?

191
00:13:27,259 --> 00:13:28,719
- Something
happening down there?

192
00:13:29,053 --> 00:13:31,931
- No, nothing's
happening down there.

193
00:13:34,266 --> 00:13:36,352
- Why are you filming nothing?

194
00:13:36,686 --> 00:13:37,894
- Look, first of
all, this isn't film.

195
00:13:37,895 --> 00:13:39,230
It's videotape, all right?

196
00:13:39,563 --> 00:13:41,357
Second of all, I'm an artist,
I don't have to explain to you

197
00:13:41,691 --> 00:13:43,484
or anybody else in the
world what I'm doing.

198
00:13:43,818 --> 00:13:47,612
Huh, art.

199
00:13:47,613 --> 00:13:49,865
- But there's nothing
happening down there.

200
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:53,285
- You'd be surprised what you
can do in the editing process.

201
00:13:53,619 --> 00:13:55,537
Bam.

202
00:13:55,538 --> 00:13:57,373
- [Michael] What's
your video about?

203
00:13:57,707 --> 00:14:00,501
- It's a goddamn
documentary, all right?

204
00:14:00,835 --> 00:14:02,461
- About the murders?

205
00:14:04,505 --> 00:14:06,506
- Yeah.

206
00:14:06,507 --> 00:14:07,758
About the murders.

207
00:14:09,093 --> 00:14:10,469
I mean, why else
would I be here,

208
00:14:10,803 --> 00:14:12,638
at this hour, freezing
my ass off, huh?

209
00:14:12,972 --> 00:14:14,265
And listen, don't try and
rip me off, all right?

210
00:14:14,598 --> 00:14:15,640
That happened to me once before,

211
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:17,852
and I didn't take kindly
to it, you understand?

212
00:14:18,185 --> 00:14:21,313
First they steal your
ideas, then your creativity,

213
00:14:21,647 --> 00:14:23,149
and then goes your bank book.

214
00:14:23,482 --> 00:14:24,900
And I tell you wha...

215
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:27,819
(ominous music)

216
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:33,408

(chuckles)

218
00:14:36,662 --> 00:14:40,207
Now, was that strange
or was that strange?

219
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:46,337
Oh, man.

220
00:14:46,338 --> 00:14:47,339
I don't know.

221
00:14:48,466 --> 00:14:51,010

(dramatic chords)

225
00:15:34,261 --> 00:15:36,097
(chuckles) Get a hold
of yourself, man.

226
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,349
Just get a hold of yourself.

227
00:15:40,476 --> 00:15:42,103

Geez!

231
00:15:51,153 --> 00:15:52,070
Van!

232
00:15:52,071 --> 00:15:53,322
- [Van] Not tonight.

233
00:15:53,656 --> 00:15:55,032
(suspenseful music)

234
00:15:55,366 --> 00:15:57,535
- Van, honey, you're
almost an hour late.

235
00:15:57,868 --> 00:15:59,954
- Let's go, inside.

236
00:16:00,287 --> 00:16:02,957
- Now suddenly he's
in a big hurry.

237
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:05,501
- [Woman] Maybe we
should think about this?

238
00:16:05,835 --> 00:16:07,127
- What're you, crazy?

239
00:16:07,128 --> 00:16:08,754
I told you this was easy money.

240
00:16:09,088 --> 00:16:10,380
Besides, we'll go
to Drac's after.

241
00:16:10,381 --> 00:16:12,091
We'll have a really good time.

242
00:16:12,424 --> 00:16:15,177
- No, forget it,
um, I'm leaving!

243
00:16:15,511 --> 00:16:17,054
Just tell Van I lost
my nerves, okay?

244
00:16:17,388 --> 00:16:19,765
- Oh, come on, don't be
a chickenshit, please!

245
00:16:20,099 --> 00:16:21,684
- [Woman] I am chickenshit
and I'll wait for you

246
00:16:22,017 --> 00:16:24,103
at Drac's tonight, okay?

247
00:16:24,436 --> 00:16:27,565
Bye, baby!

you might still be awake.

- Come on in.

Your last letter said you were
arranging a list of suspects.

306

00:23:23,647 --> 00:23:25,440
Well, a couple anyway.

308
00:23:26,942 --> 00:23:30,070
There's over 2,000
names on that list.

00:23:30,988 --> 00:23:38,494
- Mm-hm.

310
00:23:38,495 --> 00:23:42,498
Amazing.

What a city.

312
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:46,295
- Only the first

313
00:23:46,628 --> 00:23:49,339
They have records of kinkiness.

314
00:23:49,673 --> 00:23:51,174
L.A. you know.

315
00:23:51,508 --> 00:23:52,593
- Any conclusions?

316
00:23:52,926 --> 00:23:55,596
- None that you'd
be interested in.

317
00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:57,347
- [Michael] Try me.

318
00:23:59,016 --> 00:24:00,851
- Not one of them is a vampire.

319
00:24:02,311 --> 00:24:03,395
- You're right.

320
00:24:03,729 --> 00:24:05,063
That doesn't interest me.

321
00:24:06,565 --> 00:24:08,483
But you're the believer.

322
00:24:09,401 --> 00:24:10,861
What makes you so sure?

323
00:24:11,194 --> 00:24:14,364
- None of them have
been seen in daylight.

324
00:24:16,575 --> 00:24:19,410
- Oh, yes.

325
00:24:19,411 --> 00:24:20,746
The lore.

326
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:23,498
Can't be seen in mirrors,
afraid of garlic.

327
00:24:23,832 --> 00:24:25,834
All those sorts of things.

(Lori chuckles)

329
00:24:33,925 --> 00:24:35,177
- Is that a smile?

330
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,512
- You're really obsessed
with this vampire business.

331
00:24:37,846 --> 00:24:39,306
- Put my personal beliefs
aside for a second,

332
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,142
I also happen to be a
damn good investigator.

333
00:24:42,476 --> 00:24:45,270
And rule one is, you work from
a theory that fits the facts.

334
00:24:45,604 --> 00:24:48,982
Now, the facts are, we've
got a killer running around,

335
00:24:49,316 --> 00:24:52,069
who drains his victim of blood.

336
00:24:52,402 --> 00:24:54,404
Now, what are the possibilities?

337
00:24:54,738 --> 00:24:55,822
Who drinks blood?

338
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:01,703
- Nobody said the
killer drinks the blood.

339
00:25:02,037 --> 00:25:03,455
- Puncture wounds?

340
00:25:05,248 --> 00:25:07,334
- Just kinkiness.
- (chuckles) No.

341
00:25:07,668 --> 00:25:10,420
Rule two is you don't alter
the facts to fit the theory.

342
00:25:10,754 --> 00:25:12,297
The facts say vampire.

343
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:19,513
- Look, the victims' bodies
are still at the morgue, right?

344
00:25:19,846 --> 00:25:21,682
- [Lori] As far as I know.

345
00:25:22,015 --> 00:25:23,392
- Well, doesn't legend say

346
00:25:23,725 --> 00:25:26,228
that the vampire's
victim becomes a vampire?

347
00:25:26,561 --> 00:25:27,646
- That depends.

348
00:25:27,979 --> 00:25:32,609
- Look, the dead are dead, no
matter how they got that way.

349
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,321
Dead and that's all.

350
00:25:39,658 --> 00:25:41,243
- Do you know that some
people believe that the spirit

351
00:25:41,576 --> 00:25:43,912
hangs around for a while?

352
00:25:44,246 --> 00:25:45,371
That if you can get
in touch with them,

353
00:25:45,372 --> 00:25:47,249
they can tell you things?

354
00:25:48,542 --> 00:25:49,667
- [Michael] I suppose
you're one of the people

355
00:25:49,668 --> 00:25:51,420
who believes that?

356
00:25:51,753 --> 00:25:53,964
- Actually, I am trying
to get in touch with them.

357
00:25:54,297 --> 00:25:56,383
Maybe one of the murder
victims can tell me something.

358
00:25:56,717 --> 00:26:00,303
- I need someone to
investigate the living.

359
00:26:00,637 --> 00:26:02,514
Let's stick to reality.

360
00:26:02,848 --> 00:26:05,976
- There are all
kinds of reality.

361
00:26:06,309 --> 00:26:07,394
(Michael chuckles)

362
00:26:07,728 --> 00:26:09,187
- Good luck.

363
00:26:09,521 --> 00:26:11,064
Let me know when the
spirits talk to you.

364
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:15,152
- (chuckles) You're funny, huh?

365
00:26:17,195 --> 00:26:18,238
- I didn't mean to
make fun of you,

366
00:26:18,572 --> 00:26:21,074
but you must admit
it's a little bizarre.

367
00:26:21,408 --> 00:26:26,204
- That's okay, it was worth it
just to see you smile again.

368
00:26:26,955 --> 00:26:28,290
- [Michael] I should go.

369
00:26:28,623 --> 00:26:29,958
- Really? So soon?

370
00:26:30,292 --> 00:26:32,085
Why don't you stay and watch
some of this movie with me?

371
00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:33,754
- More vampires?

372
00:26:34,087 --> 00:26:35,088
No, thank you.

373
00:26:36,381 --> 00:26:38,091
- When will I see you again?

374
00:26:38,425 --> 00:26:40,010
- I'll call you in a day or two.

375
00:26:41,595 --> 00:26:43,138
(chuckles)

376
00:26:43,472 --> 00:26:48,809
Jet lag.

377
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,353
Tell me something.

378
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:55,817
What're you gonna do with
your vampire, if you find him?

379
00:26:56,151 --> 00:26:59,279
- (chuckles) I don't know.

380
00:26:59,613 --> 00:27:02,282
(Michael chuckles)

381
00:27:03,283 --> 00:27:06,076
- Goodnight.

382
00:27:06,077 --> 00:27:20,466
Lori.

383
00:27:20,467 --> 00:27:28,467
(suspenseful music)

384
00:29:30,305 --> 00:29:35,226
(ominous tones)
(music intensifies)

385
00:30:16,059 --> 00:30:19,354
(intense distorted tones)

386
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,271
(knocks)

387
00:31:02,605 --> 00:31:04,357
(knocks)

388
00:31:07,444 --> 00:31:10,113
- Up and at 'em, morning glory.

389
00:31:15,535 --> 00:31:17,829
Look, I brought
you some groceries.

390
00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:20,790
Oh, listen, I'm sorry
that we didn't make it

391
00:31:21,124 --> 00:31:22,459
to Drac's last night.

392
00:31:22,792 --> 00:31:25,420
You know Van, one thing
led to another and,

393
00:31:25,754 --> 00:31:27,547
well, we never made
it out of the house.

394
00:31:27,881 --> 00:31:30,050
Jenny, it's almost 8:30.

395
00:31:30,383 --> 00:31:32,218
Don't you have to be at work?

396
00:31:32,552 --> 00:31:34,011
Jenny?

397
00:31:34,012 --> 00:31:40,017
Jenny.

398
00:31:40,018 --> 00:31:44,938
Jenny?

399
00:31:44,939 --> 00:31:46,274
Jenny?

400
00:31:46,608 --> 00:31:50,152
Jenny, Jenny!

401
00:31:50,153 --> 00:31:52,363
Oh, God, you scared me.

402
00:31:52,697 --> 00:31:54,908
(Jenny groans)

403
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,203
Well, listen, I
brought some groceries.

404
00:31:58,536 --> 00:32:00,830
Breakfast in 15 minutes?

405
00:32:01,164 --> 00:32:04,334
(Jenny groans)

406
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:07,253
- The thing about
him is his eyes.

407
00:32:08,463 --> 00:32:10,799
The way they look at you.

408
00:32:11,132 --> 00:32:12,592
It's kind of hypnotic, you know?

409
00:32:12,926 --> 00:32:15,261
- Oh, brother, are you gone.

410
00:32:15,595 --> 00:32:16,721
Michael Fury, huh?

411
00:32:17,597 --> 00:32:19,265
That's a nice name.

412
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:24,062
So, when are you gonna
see Mr. Fury again?

413
00:32:24,395 --> 00:32:26,772
- Um...

414
00:32:26,773 --> 00:32:28,316
Tonight at Drac's.

415
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:30,735
- No, you're not.

416
00:32:31,069 --> 00:32:34,364
You promised me that you'd
do the video with me and Van!

417
00:32:35,657 --> 00:32:37,283
- No more, Cherry.

418
00:32:37,617 --> 00:32:41,371
- But he's a famous
artist and I promised him!

419
00:32:41,704 --> 00:32:43,248
- He's using us.

420
00:32:43,581 --> 00:32:47,377
- He just got some kind
of big grant, he's rich!

421
00:32:48,545 --> 00:32:50,130
- [Jenny] He's weird.

422
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:01,432
- Will you at least come
along and keep me company?

423
00:33:01,766 --> 00:33:06,562
Please?

424
00:33:06,563 --> 00:33:08,273
- [Radio Host]
You've won $1,000!

425
00:33:08,606 --> 00:33:11,151
- Oh, my god!
- You've won $1,000!

426
00:33:11,484 --> 00:33:12,986
- [Caller] No way.

427
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:15,363
- [Host] The station that
just loves to give you money!

428
00:33:15,697 --> 00:33:18,199
(horn honks)
(lively rock music)

429
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:21,035
And now for all you people
sitting in that big gridlock

430
00:33:21,369 --> 00:33:23,955
called the 405,
here's Jay Willis!

431
00:33:25,582 --> 00:33:26,875
- [Jay] The number two lane
closed for a couple minutes on

432
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:32,005
transition, harbor northbound
to the Santa Monica westbound.

433
00:33:32,755 --> 00:33:33,797
- [Van] Oh, that's good.

434
00:33:33,798 --> 00:33:35,800
Very good, yes, I like that.

435
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,095
Huh, open up, open up.

436
00:33:39,429 --> 00:33:42,097
Yes.

437
00:33:42,098 --> 00:33:45,435
That's nice. (chuckles)

438
00:33:48,146 --> 00:33:51,399
Wet your lips, you
make me, I'll tell ya.

439
00:33:51,733 --> 00:33:54,402
(Cherry giggles)

440
00:33:55,987 --> 00:33:58,198
- [Jenny] What's
this thing here?

441
00:33:58,531 --> 00:34:00,658
- That's a vampire hunting
sword, 16th Century.

442
00:34:00,992 --> 00:34:02,368
Just put it down, put it down.

443
00:34:02,702 --> 00:34:04,245
Thank you, step away.
(Jenny chuckles)

444
00:34:04,579 --> 00:34:07,247
Very good.

445
00:34:07,248 --> 00:34:09,542
Right there, right there, yes.

446
00:34:11,252 --> 00:34:12,837
Oh, the lick, yes, lick it.

447
00:34:13,171 --> 00:34:14,421
Beautiful.

448
00:34:14,422 --> 00:34:16,299
Just move around, scoot around.

449
00:34:16,633 --> 00:34:18,259
That's good, yes, yes.

450
00:34:18,593 --> 00:34:19,928
- "Woman found dead.

451
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,014
"Blood drained."

452
00:34:24,307 --> 00:34:26,643
Oh, here's one about
the third victim.

453
00:34:26,976 --> 00:34:28,770
Metropolis, two nights ago.

454
00:34:29,103 --> 00:34:31,314
- [Van] Oh, gorgeous.

455
00:34:31,648 --> 00:34:32,773
Yes, that's good.

456
00:34:32,774 --> 00:34:34,400
- Do you think maybe
it's really a vampire?

457
00:34:34,734 --> 00:34:35,944
- Vampires.

458
00:34:36,277 --> 00:34:38,404
(chuckles) Right.

459
00:34:38,738 --> 00:34:40,030
- Well, you know,
Van's great-great

460
00:34:40,031 --> 00:34:41,324
grandmother was
a vampire hunter.

461
00:34:41,658 --> 00:34:43,660
- Get out, there's
no such thing.

462
00:34:43,993 --> 00:34:46,371
- Jenny, babe, try not
to comment on things

463
00:34:46,704 --> 00:34:47,956
you know absolutely
nothing about, all right?

464
00:34:48,289 --> 00:34:50,249
Come here.

465
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,376
Let me have the chicken.

466
00:34:51,709 --> 00:34:52,626
You've had enough
to eat, all right?

467
00:34:52,627 --> 00:34:54,045
You're always eatin', sit down.

468
00:34:55,463 --> 00:34:57,382
Okay, now look at
me, look at me.

469
00:34:57,715 --> 00:34:59,842
(Cherry and Jenny giggle)

470
00:35:01,427 --> 00:35:02,428
My god, girls.

471
00:35:02,762 --> 00:35:04,722
(Cherry and Jenny giggle)

472
00:35:05,056 --> 00:35:06,266
Do you see the, listen to me.

473
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:07,809
Look at me, look at
me, look at me, good.

474
00:35:08,142 --> 00:35:09,059
(Cherry and Jenny giggle)

475
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,396
Jenny, just take your finger.

476
00:35:11,729 --> 00:35:13,231
Look at me.

477
00:35:13,564 --> 00:35:16,150
Thank you, take your finger
and just, very lightly,

478
00:35:16,484 --> 00:35:18,486
with your fingernail,
touch the egg.

479
00:35:19,445 --> 00:35:21,781
The egg.
- The egg's over here.

480
00:35:22,115 --> 00:35:23,365
- Come on.

481
00:35:23,366 --> 00:35:24,574
Good, now just hold
it right there.

482
00:35:24,575 --> 00:35:25,910
Hold on, hold on.

483
00:35:26,828 --> 00:35:28,121
(Cherry and Jenny giggle)

484
00:35:28,454 --> 00:35:30,206
- That's tickles.
- Don't move, don't move.

485
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,665
- Your hands are freezing.
- Just touch it.

486
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:32,874
- My hands are greasy.
- For Christ sakes.

487
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:34,252
Just touch the egg!

488
00:35:34,585 --> 00:35:36,504
Take your index finger.

489
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:38,673
(Cherry and Jenny giggle)
Gently...

490
00:35:39,007 --> 00:35:40,216
(all laugh)

491
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,260
Oh, this could get weird.

492
00:35:42,593 --> 00:35:45,388
Take your index finger,
not on foot, on the egg.

493
00:35:46,681 --> 00:35:49,183
Very good, right there,
now just hold it.

494
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:52,145
(Cherry screams)
(Jenny laughs)

495
00:35:52,478 --> 00:35:54,272
Oh, that's good, don't wipe
it off, don't wipe it off.

496
00:35:54,605 --> 00:35:56,858
Don't wipe it, oh no,
back off, back off!

497
00:35:57,191 --> 00:35:58,693
(Cherry and Jenny laugh)
Hold it right there.

498
00:35:59,027 --> 00:36:00,737
Hold that, hold that, hold
your leg, hold your leg!

499
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,947
(Cherry and Jenny laugh)

500
00:36:05,658 --> 00:36:07,243
God, yes, absolute master.

501
00:36:07,577 --> 00:36:09,120
The curves.

502
00:36:09,454 --> 00:36:12,332
The texture, shadows,
texture shadows.

503
00:36:12,665 --> 00:36:14,709
Tantalizing
ambiguities. (chuckles)

504
00:36:15,043 --> 00:36:16,461
This is fantastic.

505
00:36:23,468 --> 00:36:25,553
(ominous tones)

506
00:36:25,887 --> 00:36:28,389
(tape rewinds)

507
00:36:37,857 --> 00:36:40,151
("She's Tuff")

508
00:36:40,485 --> 00:36:43,321
- [Host] A little love in
the fast lane from Bill Cool.

509
00:36:43,654 --> 00:36:45,114
- [Anchor] The afternoon
commute home, Tom?

510
00:36:45,448 --> 00:36:47,492
- [Tom] Pauline, southbound
55 there's an accident

511
00:36:47,825 --> 00:36:49,077
in the number two lane.

512
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:53,247
(radio chatter
overlaps each other)

513
00:36:53,581 --> 00:36:55,625
- [Host] Hot new
group, Durango 95!

514
00:36:55,958 --> 00:37:00,713
(lively rock music)
(muffled radio chatter)

515
00:37:04,634 --> 00:37:07,553
(suspenseful music)

516
00:37:13,768 --> 00:37:16,687
- The darkness is his domain.

517
00:37:17,021 --> 00:37:20,066
To be seen yet unseen
is no difficult task,

518
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,193
for one such as he.

519
00:37:22,485 --> 00:37:24,612
The shadow you thought
you did not see

520
00:37:24,946 --> 00:37:29,367
flitting against the walls
of your darkened bedroom.

521
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,785
It was there.

522
00:37:31,786 --> 00:37:33,996
The sound you could almost hear!

523
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:36,332
His voice in another form!

524
00:37:37,667 --> 00:37:39,252
Yes.

525
00:37:39,585 --> 00:37:41,462
The hiss of distant snakes.

526
00:37:44,882 --> 00:37:49,762
Though his power over beasts
is great, it is not limitless.

527
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,556
No, sadly, no.

528
00:37:53,474 --> 00:37:55,643
Certain animals do not obey him.

529
00:37:55,977 --> 00:37:59,397
Indeed, would hurt
him, if they could!

530
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:00,940
Small dogs.

531
00:38:01,274 --> 00:38:05,236
Especially Pekingese,
Dachshunds, Cocker Spaniels!

532
00:38:06,154 --> 00:38:09,031
They are more to my liking.

533
00:38:10,575 --> 00:38:12,535
The blood is the life.

534
00:38:13,578 --> 00:38:16,456
In truth, his blood
is pale as water.

535
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:22,252
Pale blood.

536
00:38:22,253 --> 00:38:24,755
(ominous tones)

537
00:38:53,075 --> 00:38:55,453
Pale blood.

538
00:39:04,212 --> 00:39:06,506
(eerie tones)

539
00:39:36,035 --> 00:39:37,285
- Hey, Lori.

540
00:39:37,286 --> 00:39:38,287
(Lori gasps)

541
00:39:38,621 --> 00:39:39,788
Are you okay?

542
00:39:39,789 --> 00:39:45,418
- Yeah.

543
00:39:45,419 --> 00:39:46,879
Let's go sit down.

544
00:39:47,213 --> 00:39:50,424
- Though his powers are
greater than his limitations,

545
00:39:50,758 --> 00:39:52,301
the night only is his,

546
00:39:53,803 --> 00:39:57,431
yet how completely he
dominates the darkness.

547
00:39:59,058 --> 00:40:02,937
He can become shadow itself
and flow through windows,

548
00:40:04,021 --> 00:40:06,065
like water through cloth!

549
00:40:08,568 --> 00:40:10,570
To be heard, yet unheard.

550
00:40:11,988 --> 00:40:14,407
His voice in another form.

551
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,200
Yes, the hiss of--
- Hi, Jenny.

552
00:40:16,534 --> 00:40:18,828
- Hi.
- Distant snakes!

553
00:40:19,161 --> 00:40:20,746
The blood is the life.

554
00:40:22,081 --> 00:40:23,791
- I was afraid
you wouldn't come.

555
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:25,751
(Michael chuckles)

556
00:40:26,085 --> 00:40:27,211
- I'm here.

557
00:40:27,545 --> 00:40:31,215
- We spent this
wonderful night together.

558
00:40:31,549 --> 00:40:34,176
There are so many things
I want to know about you.

559
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:35,678
- Jenny.

560
00:40:36,012 --> 00:40:38,556
- Michael, I think I'm
falling in love with--

561
00:40:38,889 --> 00:40:40,932
- Jenny.

562
00:40:40,933 --> 00:40:43,811
(suspenseful music)

563
00:40:45,855 --> 00:40:49,566
Listen to me.

564
00:40:49,567 --> 00:40:51,068
You don't know me.

565
00:40:52,695 --> 00:40:55,531
You don't who I
am, or what I am.

566
00:40:58,367 --> 00:41:00,244
I can't let myself love.

567
00:41:02,538 --> 00:41:04,539
Anyone.

568
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:07,417
So, please.

569
00:41:07,418 --> 00:41:08,961
No more questions.

570
00:41:16,802 --> 00:41:20,347
Jenny.

571
00:41:20,348 --> 00:41:22,016
(Jenny chuckles)

572
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:23,975
- So?

573
00:41:23,976 --> 00:41:25,394
- So what?

574
00:41:25,728 --> 00:41:28,356
- Are you going to give me
your telephone number or not?

575
00:41:28,689 --> 00:41:30,691
- Barkeep, double scotch, rocks,
(speaks foreign language).

576
00:41:31,025 --> 00:41:32,777
- Van, Van, there's Jenny.

577
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:35,279
- Where?
- Sittin' right over there.

578
00:41:35,613 --> 00:41:36,697
- Jenny, Jenny.

579
00:41:37,615 --> 00:41:39,700
Just the girl I wanna see.

580
00:41:43,871 --> 00:41:45,164
Hi, Jenny.
- Hi, Jenny.

581
00:41:45,498 --> 00:41:48,042
- [Jenny] Hi, have
you met Michael Fury?

582
00:41:49,251 --> 00:41:50,961
(ominous tones)

583
00:41:51,295 --> 00:41:53,046
- I...

584
00:41:53,047 --> 00:41:55,132
- How is the video going?

585
00:41:55,466 --> 00:41:56,801
- It's goin'.

586
00:41:57,134 --> 00:41:58,552
- So listen, do you
mind if we join you?

587
00:41:58,886 --> 00:42:00,096
- No, look, we gotta go.

588
00:42:00,429 --> 00:42:01,472
- Wait a minute,
we just got here.

589
00:42:01,806 --> 00:42:03,057
- You wanna stay here, you
stay, I got work to do.

590
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,433
- [Cherry] Van!

591
00:42:05,476 --> 00:42:07,311
- [Van] Damn it, every
time I turn around.

592
00:42:08,437 --> 00:42:09,689
- Who was that?

593
00:42:10,606 --> 00:42:11,941
- I told you he was weird.

594
00:42:12,274 --> 00:42:14,485
- Listen, I don't wanna
hear it right now, okay?

595
00:42:14,819 --> 00:42:15,820
- I've gotta go.

596
00:42:16,153 --> 00:42:17,321
- Hey, but what about tonight?

597
00:42:17,655 --> 00:42:19,365
I mean, we're supposed to--
- Maybe later, huh?

598
00:42:21,283 --> 00:42:22,910
- [Michael] Would
you like a drink?

599
00:42:23,244 --> 00:42:25,746
- No, I'll get it
myself, thanks.

600
00:42:35,673 --> 00:42:36,966
- Tell me about him.

601
00:42:37,299 --> 00:42:39,467
- Van?

602
00:42:39,468 --> 00:42:41,345
He's an artist, I've been
doing a video with him.

603
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:43,888
- Really?

604
00:42:43,889 --> 00:42:46,267
I'd like to see it.
(Jenny chuckles)

605
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:49,437
- Oh, God, no, you wouldn't
wanna see any of that stuff.

606
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:52,397
- Why not?

607
00:42:52,398 --> 00:42:54,191
- It's an erotic video.

608
00:42:56,235 --> 00:42:59,029
I wouldn't want you to
think of me that way.

609
00:43:01,449 --> 00:43:02,742
- I don't.

610
00:43:03,075 --> 00:43:04,285
- [Van] Where is it?

611
00:43:04,618 --> 00:43:07,288
I know what I saw, I
know it's here somewhere.

612
00:43:07,621 --> 00:43:10,207
Come on, Van, it's
the big time now.

613
00:43:10,541 --> 00:43:11,624
There.

614
00:43:11,625 --> 00:43:13,586
There it is, right there.

come true, this...

Sure, fight him with

Stupid.

You know what he's
doing, he's using Jenny.

652
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,672

- You just don't understand.

660

You're a beautiful
girl, full of energy.

661
00:46:29,448 --> 00:46:30,491
So beautiful.

662
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:33,494
You're so young.

663

You have so much life
to look forward to.

664
00:46:44,254 --> 00:46:46,590
- Do you really wanna
see Van's tapes?

665
00:46:46,924 --> 00:46:48,592
I can get some of them for
you, do you want me to?

666
00:46:48,926 --> 00:46:50,385
- No.

667
00:46:50,386 --> 00:46:52,388
I can handle it myself.

669
00:46:55,099 --> 00:46:56,433

670
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,602
You know that, don't you?

671
00:47:06,944 --> 00:47:08,362

How did you get in here?

676
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:13,946
- I, uh, I rented this
condo for you, remember?

677
00:49:14,279 --> 00:49:15,405
I got the keys.

678
00:49:19,952 --> 00:49:21,787
What's in the suitcase?

679
00:49:40,055 --> 00:49:42,683
- I'm not paying your
agency to investigate me.

680
00:49:45,352 --> 00:49:47,980
Shouldn't you be
looking for a murderer?

681
00:49:53,402 --> 00:49:55,946
- I am looking for a murderer.

682
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:05,080
- Meaning what?

683
00:50:06,498 --> 00:50:08,958
I'm a suspect?

684
00:50:08,959 --> 00:50:10,961
- Everyone's a suspect.

685
00:50:11,295 --> 00:50:13,255
(laughs)

686
00:50:13,589 --> 00:50:16,049
- Spoken like a
master detective.

687
00:50:17,759 --> 00:50:20,179
- I don't think this is funny.

688
00:50:20,512 --> 00:50:22,264
(chuckles)

689
00:50:22,598 --> 00:50:25,434
I did a computer search on you.

690
00:50:25,767 --> 00:50:26,935
You don't exist.

691
00:50:33,567 --> 00:50:37,696
- Computers makes mistakes.
(Lori chuckles)

692
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:41,408
If I were the killer,
why would I hire you?

693
00:50:41,742 --> 00:50:43,410
- Maybe you want someone to

694
00:50:43,744 --> 00:50:46,413
uncover evidence
you left behind.

695
00:50:49,208 --> 00:50:51,376
- No, my letters
came from Europe.

696
00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:53,337
- That could be arranged.

697
00:51:06,642 --> 00:51:08,769
- You're actually serious.

698
00:51:24,493 --> 00:51:26,203
- You're not a killer.

699
00:51:26,536 --> 00:51:28,330
- Then what are
you searching for?

700
00:51:32,542 --> 00:51:34,378
- I was hoping you
were the real thing.

701
00:51:34,711 --> 00:51:36,255
- "The real thing?"

702
00:51:36,588 --> 00:51:38,465
- You know what I mean.

703
00:51:40,217 --> 00:51:41,343
(Michael sighs)

704
00:51:41,677 --> 00:51:43,220
- What luck.

705
00:51:43,553 --> 00:51:44,846
I come all this way,

706
00:51:47,266 --> 00:51:49,851
and all I get are
hallucinations.

707
00:51:51,436 --> 00:51:52,437
Crazy people.

708
00:51:52,771 --> 00:51:53,939
- What hallucinations?

709
00:51:54,273 --> 00:51:56,358
(eerie music)

710
00:51:57,442 --> 00:51:59,152
- Nevermind.

711
00:51:59,486 --> 00:52:00,612
Forget it.

712
00:52:00,946 --> 00:52:02,072
- Please, Michael, I need to
know, what are you seeing?

713
00:52:02,406 --> 00:52:03,865
- What I'm seeing is
none of your business.

714
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:07,327
- No, it is, you see I'm
causing what you're seeing!

715
00:52:09,037 --> 00:52:11,372
- No.

716
00:52:11,373 --> 00:52:12,749
No, you don't have that
kind of power, you can't.

717
00:52:13,083 --> 00:52:14,333
- How do you know?

718
00:52:14,334 --> 00:52:15,919
- Because it's
just not possible.

719
00:52:16,253 --> 00:52:18,171
- It is possible.

720
00:52:18,505 --> 00:52:20,340
I've been working for
those visions, you see?

721
00:52:20,674 --> 00:52:23,468
Only, they've been
coming to you!

722
00:52:23,802 --> 00:52:28,473
- If that's true, what you're
doing is extremely dangerous.

723
00:52:28,807 --> 00:52:30,225
You're playing with things
you know nothing about.

724
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:31,684
Leave the dead alone!

725
00:52:31,685 --> 00:52:33,061
- Michael, please.

726
00:52:34,771 --> 00:52:38,191
I need to know
what you're seeing.

727
00:52:38,525 --> 00:52:39,608
(distorted screams)

728
00:52:39,609 --> 00:52:41,320
- Blood, I'm seeing blood.

729
00:52:43,572 --> 00:52:46,074
Sometimes I think I'm going mad.

730
00:52:51,079 --> 00:53:03,132
Satisfied?

731
00:53:03,133 --> 00:53:05,177
(Lori sighs)

732
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:07,471
- You're not mad, Michael.

733
00:53:08,597 --> 00:53:10,474
I don't know what you are,

734
00:53:11,433 --> 00:53:13,643
but you're not mad.

735
00:53:13,977 --> 00:53:15,312
- I'm far from home.

736
00:53:17,397 --> 00:53:18,523
Far from home.

737
00:53:21,401 --> 00:53:22,527
And I'm tired.

738
00:53:25,072 --> 00:53:26,323
I need to rest.

739
00:53:29,868 --> 00:53:32,788
(suspenseful music)

740
00:53:35,582 --> 00:53:37,501
(sighs)

741
00:53:49,513 --> 00:53:51,431
(moans)

742
00:53:54,142 --> 00:53:55,936
(gasps)

743
00:53:56,269 --> 00:53:58,063
(groans)

744
00:54:05,028 --> 00:54:07,489
(gasps)

745
00:54:07,823 --> 00:54:10,283
(sighs)

746
00:54:10,617 --> 00:54:12,618
- [Lori] No.

747
00:54:12,619 --> 00:54:13,620
No.

748
00:54:13,954 --> 00:54:15,747
(moans)

749
00:54:17,582 --> 00:54:20,085
(Michael gasps)

750
00:54:22,754 --> 00:54:24,923
(Michael pants)

751
00:54:25,257 --> 00:54:27,676
(moans)

752
00:54:28,009 --> 00:54:30,345
(Michael groans)

753
00:54:30,679 --> 00:54:31,846
- [Michael] No!

754
00:54:31,847 --> 00:54:33,598
(gasps)

755
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,314
(breathes heavily)

756
00:54:49,614 --> 00:54:52,492
(Michael and Lori moan)

757
00:54:52,826 --> 00:54:54,744
(gasps)

758
00:54:55,078 --> 00:55:01,125
No!

759
00:55:01,126 --> 00:55:03,794
Stop!

760
00:55:03,795 --> 00:55:05,755
(Lori moans)

761
00:55:06,089 --> 00:55:14,089
(Lori grunts)

762
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:39,432
(door slams)
(Lori gasps)

763
00:57:05,083 --> 00:57:08,502
- Michael?

764
00:57:08,503 --> 00:57:12,464
Michael?

765
00:57:12,465 --> 00:57:34,612
Michael.

766
00:57:34,613 --> 00:57:36,531
(sighs)

767
00:57:39,242 --> 00:57:41,536
- [Radio Host] Right now for
you early risers, it's music--

768
00:57:41,870 --> 00:57:43,538
- [Radio Host] In Los Angeles,
the weather for the southland

769
00:57:43,872 --> 00:57:46,249
is more of the same, low
clouds here this morning,

770
00:57:46,583 --> 00:57:49,044
hot and smoggy but
sunny this afternoon.

771
00:57:49,377 --> 00:57:52,797
Highs generally in the mid-80s
in the downtown area...

772
00:57:53,131 --> 00:57:54,424
- [Radio Host] It's going to
be busy on the Santa Monica

773
00:57:54,758 --> 00:57:57,218
freeway east and westbound,
a lot of heavy traffic

774
00:57:57,552 --> 00:58:00,138
this morning on the
Santa Monica freeway.

775
00:58:00,472 --> 00:58:01,723
Had an earlier
accident, eastbound,

776
00:58:02,057 --> 00:58:03,808
before the harbor
area in the fast lane.

777
00:58:04,142 --> 00:58:06,686
That has been cleared,
southbound on the 405.

778
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:08,938
♪ Love is just a fable

779
00:58:09,272 --> 00:58:13,610
- Oh, Michael.
♪ And a wrung out fantasy

780
00:58:14,736 --> 00:58:17,322
♪ You made me able

781
00:58:17,656 --> 00:58:21,368
♪ To look deeper right into me

782
00:58:22,869 --> 00:58:26,039
♪ I know the consequence

783
00:58:26,373 --> 00:58:29,751
(overlapping radio chatter)

784
00:58:31,252 --> 00:58:33,046
- [Radio Host] And potentially
lethal shellfish from

785
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:36,633
Washington State, the
scallops contain vasotoxin.

786
00:58:36,966 --> 00:58:39,594
That's a naturally-occurring
poison that can cause--

787
00:58:39,928 --> 00:58:41,596
- [Radio Host] And
Cincinnati, five-nothing.

788
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:43,723
Chicago four, Philadelphia one.

789
00:58:44,057 --> 00:58:46,643
Montreal took Pittsburgh
five-four in 11 innings,

790
00:58:46,976 --> 00:58:49,562
and the Mets ended their
seven game losing streak.

791
00:58:49,896 --> 00:58:53,483
(overlapping radio chatter)

792
00:59:31,354 --> 00:59:33,522
- Van?

793
00:59:33,523 --> 00:59:34,858
Is anybody home?

794
00:59:37,026 --> 00:59:39,946
(suspenseful music)

795
01:00:06,055 --> 01:00:08,016
(gasps) Hi, um, um...

796
01:00:09,893 --> 01:00:11,352
- How you doin'?

797
01:00:11,686 --> 01:00:13,730
- I was, oh God, you scared
me, I was looking for Cherry.

798
01:00:14,063 --> 01:00:15,356
- Ah.

799
01:00:15,690 --> 01:00:17,275
It's amazing, you know, I
was just thinking about you.

800
01:00:17,609 --> 01:00:20,320
It's like you're
reading my mind.

801
01:00:20,653 --> 01:00:23,448
Anyhow, Cherry won't be
back for a little while.

802
01:00:23,782 --> 01:00:25,575
- I really gotta go now.
- No, you know what?

803
01:00:25,909 --> 01:00:27,368
I have something
I wanna show ya.

804
01:00:27,702 --> 01:00:28,745
- No, I really gotta go, Van.

805
01:00:29,078 --> 01:00:31,414
- No, look, it won't take
long at all, it's beautiful.

806
01:00:31,748 --> 01:00:32,832
Very special.

807
01:00:33,166 --> 01:00:34,667
So, how you doin'?
- Fine.

808
01:00:35,001 --> 01:00:36,002
- Are you well?
- Uh-huh.

809
01:00:36,336 --> 01:00:37,962
- You look so pretty today.
- Thank you.

810
01:00:38,296 --> 01:00:41,049
Will this take long?
- Jenny, you could be a star.

811
01:00:41,382 --> 01:00:42,801
With such pretty eyes.

812
01:00:43,134 --> 01:00:45,261
I want you to trust me.

813
01:00:45,595 --> 01:00:52,810
Come on.

814
01:00:52,811 --> 01:00:56,647
Go on.

815
01:00:56,648 --> 01:00:59,359
- (groans) What's
that awful smell?

816
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,611
- Garlic.

817
01:01:02,612 --> 01:01:06,574
I painted 60 gallons of
garlic juice on all the walls.

818
01:01:06,908 --> 01:01:09,452
Well, I mean almost all of 'em.

819
01:01:10,411 --> 01:01:12,080
(Jenny chuckles)

820
01:01:12,413 --> 01:01:13,665
- [Jenny] Vampires?

821
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:17,794
Are you trying to
keep vampires out?

822
01:01:18,127 --> 01:01:22,464
- No.

823
01:01:22,465 --> 01:01:26,344
I'm trying to keep a
vampire from getting out.

824
01:01:26,678 --> 01:01:27,803
- Oh.

825
01:01:27,804 --> 01:01:30,390
So, where is the vampire?

826
01:01:30,723 --> 01:01:32,976
(Van chuckles)

827
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:36,813
(chuckles)

828
01:01:37,146 --> 01:01:39,649
Hey, don't look at me.
- No?

829
01:01:39,983 --> 01:01:42,402
- I came here in
bright sunshine.

830
01:01:43,611 --> 01:01:46,446
And garlic,

831
01:01:46,447 --> 01:01:48,032
and crosses,

832
01:01:48,366 --> 01:01:49,492
don't do a thing to me.

833
01:01:49,826 --> 01:01:50,869
- Nothin', huh?

834
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:55,540
Well, you see, the
vampire's not here yet.

835
01:01:58,418 --> 01:02:00,295
- "Yet?"
- Yet.

836
01:02:00,628 --> 01:02:03,006
(steel rattles)

837
01:02:05,008 --> 01:02:06,342
But don't worry.

838
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:09,887
He's comin'.

839
01:02:09,888 --> 01:02:11,806
Gonna be here real soon.

840
01:02:14,475 --> 01:02:15,935
- Look, Van, that's
real interesting, but--

841
01:02:16,269 --> 01:02:18,771
- Oh, do you what's interesting?

842
01:02:19,105 --> 01:02:21,441
Look right up
there, right there.

843
01:02:21,774 --> 01:02:24,527
And over there, and
right behind ya.

844
01:02:26,362 --> 01:02:28,698
- (chuckles) I
don't see anything.

845
01:02:29,032 --> 01:02:31,367
- Well look, right there,
it's a hidden video camera.

846
01:02:31,701 --> 01:02:34,203
You see, first of all, I'm
gonna capture the vampire,

847
01:02:34,537 --> 01:02:35,622
then I'm gonna tape him feeding,

848
01:02:35,955 --> 01:02:38,291
and then I'm gonna become the
most famous artist in America.

849
01:02:38,625 --> 01:02:41,210
I mean, it's one,
it's two, it's three.

850
01:02:42,503 --> 01:02:43,629
- That's a very
clever idea, Van.

851
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:44,631
- I know, very clever, huh?

852
01:02:44,964 --> 01:02:47,383
- But I really--
- No, no, Jenny, Jenny.

853
01:02:47,717 --> 01:02:48,801
(kisses)

854
01:02:49,135 --> 01:02:50,887
You're so cold, so cold.

855
01:02:52,889 --> 01:02:55,683
What's the matter, you think
I'm gonna steal your purse, hm?

856
01:02:56,017 --> 01:02:58,518
Hey.

857
01:02:58,519 --> 01:02:59,645
(chuckles)

858
01:02:59,646 --> 01:03:01,314
Are you feeling guilty, hm?

859
01:03:01,648 --> 01:03:03,900
- Guilty about what?
- "Guilty about what?"

860
01:03:05,234 --> 01:03:06,235
About this.
(tense music)

861
01:03:06,527 --> 01:03:09,948
About swiping my tapes
for your boyfriend.

862
01:03:11,449 --> 01:03:12,741
(door thuds)

863
01:03:12,742 --> 01:03:13,826
You think I'm stupid?

864
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,161
You think I'm dumb?

865
01:03:15,495 --> 01:03:17,288
You think I'm retarded?

866
01:03:17,622 --> 01:03:18,705
Don't you think I know what you

867
01:03:18,706 --> 01:03:20,458
and that blood sucker are up to?

868
01:03:20,792 --> 01:03:22,084
- [Jenny] What're
you talking about?

869
01:03:22,085 --> 01:03:23,335
- Michael Fury, that's
what I'm talking about.

870
01:03:23,336 --> 01:03:24,879
That blood sucker.

871
01:03:25,213 --> 01:03:26,297
- Are you crazy or what?
- Oh, yeah?

872
01:03:26,631 --> 01:03:29,592
(Jenny gasps and screams)
I'm crazy, I'm fucking crazy!

873
01:03:29,926 --> 01:03:31,344
I'm crazy like a fox.

874
01:03:33,012 --> 01:03:35,223
I had a plan all laid
out, where these murders

875
01:03:35,556 --> 01:03:37,809
were gonna look like
the work of a vampire.

876
01:03:38,142 --> 01:03:39,352
- Did you kill those?
- Oh, yeah.

877
01:03:39,686 --> 01:03:43,231
Yeah, I killed them and
believe me, it wasn't easy.

878
01:03:43,564 --> 01:03:46,067
'Cause those things don't
come that good to me.

879
01:03:46,401 --> 01:03:48,403
'Cause you see, vampires,
they're so lonely,

880
01:03:48,736 --> 01:03:50,446
and they keep searching
and searching,

881
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:53,116
and searching for
their own kind.

882
01:03:53,449 --> 01:03:54,616
- [Jenny] You're crazy!

883
01:03:54,617 --> 01:03:55,618
- I'm crazy.

884
01:03:55,952 --> 01:03:59,247
Your boyfriend fell
right into the trap.

885
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:01,832
- You're crazy!

886
01:04:01,833 --> 01:04:04,710
- I'm crazy.

887
01:04:04,711 --> 01:04:06,546
(Jenny screams)

888
01:04:06,879 --> 01:04:09,048
(chuckles)

889
01:04:09,382 --> 01:04:11,134
The mark of the beast.

890
01:04:11,467 --> 01:04:12,719
I'm crazy?

891
01:04:13,052 --> 01:04:14,429

You know what this is?

909

This is the upper jaw of a
Mexican vampire bat, huh?

910
01:06:07,416 --> 01:06:09,252
(laughs) Fitting, isn't it?

911
01:06:09,585 --> 01:06:10,670
- Please, Van. (pants)

912
01:06:11,003 --> 01:06:12,713

was a little kinky.

924
01:06:42,410 --> 01:06:44,495

931
01:07:27,205 --> 01:07:29,373
I mean, I actually know how to
do this better than he does.

932
01:07:29,707 --> 01:07:31,209
Funny. (laughs)

933

936

Here, hold still, hold still.

938
01:07:41,552 --> 01:07:42,595
Very good, mm-hm.

939
01:07:44,388 --> 01:07:46,224
Of course, you're not gonna
be much use to him all empty,

940
01:07:46,557 --> 01:07:49,310
so, uh, I think there's
gonna be just enough left

941
01:07:49,644 --> 01:07:52,939

the meal to come. (chuckles)

951
01:10:21,712 --> 01:10:23,297

952
01:10:31,347 --> 01:10:32,640
What?

953
01:10:32,973 --> 01:10:35,101
Oh, no, no, this is wine.

954
01:10:35,434 --> 01:10:38,479
I take the blood out, I
certainly don't drink it.

955
01:10:38,813 --> 01:10:40,398
Here's to you, brother.

956
01:10:44,485 --> 01:10:46,529
- I'm not your brother.

957
01:10:47,571 --> 01:10:49,198
- Well, we are a little
touchy this evening,

958
01:10:49,532 --> 01:10:50,866
aren't we, Mr. Fury?

959
01:10:53,494 --> 01:10:55,538
- Why did you kill her?

960
01:10:56,622 --> 01:10:58,541
It wasn't necessary.

961
01:10:58,874 --> 01:11:00,584
- Look, you might wanna
do things half-assed,

962
01:11:00,918 --> 01:11:02,211
but if somebody's gonna
do somethin' right,

963
01:11:02,545 --> 01:11:04,672
they should do it right.

964
01:11:05,005 --> 01:11:06,298
- You killed them all.

965
01:11:06,632 --> 01:11:07,715
- Of course I did.

966
01:11:07,716 --> 01:11:09,510
And I've got videotape
of it, it's brilliant.

967
01:11:09,844 --> 01:11:11,971
I drained each one
of them bloodless.

968
01:11:12,304 --> 01:11:14,348
Just like you'd have done it.

969
01:11:17,143 --> 01:11:20,396
- I haven't killed
in a very long time.

970
01:11:21,605 --> 01:11:23,274
- Well, that's a goddamn
shame. (chuckles)

971
01:11:23,607 --> 01:11:26,026

therapeutic as hell.

So lonely.

975
01:11:34,326 --> 01:11:36,912
There are not many of
you left, are there?

976
01:11:37,246 --> 01:11:39,498
- You're right, there
are few of us left.

977
01:11:40,499 --> 01:11:42,418
Now all I find are perverts.

978

979

- "Madmen."

981
01:11:55,598 --> 01:11:58,309

1070
01:20:11,259 --> 01:20:12,511
- Oh, yeah, famous.

1071
01:20:13,470 --> 01:20:15,430
- Can I see Jenny now?

1072
01:20:16,473 --> 01:20:24,563
- Yeah.

1073
01:20:24,564 --> 01:20:27,192
So I bet you're wondering what
this film is about, right?

1074
01:20:27,526 --> 01:20:28,567
- Oh, yeah.
- But you know what?

1075
01:20:28,568 --> 01:20:29,695
I don't know about
you but I'm so sick

1076
01:20:30,028 --> 01:20:32,406
of the male-dominated
superiority in this business.

1077
01:20:32,739 --> 01:20:33,949
The only thing that's
respected about a woman

1078
01:20:34,282 --> 01:20:35,367
is the size of her breasts,

1079
01:20:35,701 --> 01:20:37,911
or the amount of blood that
you can throw all over her.

1080
01:20:38,245 --> 01:20:40,622
(ominous music)

1081
01:20:40,956 --> 01:20:43,291
- Come on, really,
where is Jenny?

1082
01:20:43,625 --> 01:20:45,961
- "Where's Jenny." (chuckles)

1083
01:20:46,294 --> 01:20:47,587
Step right in, my dear.

1084
01:20:47,921 --> 01:20:50,007
Welcome to fame and fortune.

1085
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:51,925
(door slams)

1086
01:20:52,259 --> 01:20:55,053
(lock clicks)
(keys clink)

1087
01:21:07,733 --> 01:21:09,525
- No closer.

1088
01:21:09,526 --> 01:21:10,777
- I knew it.

1089
01:21:11,111 --> 01:21:13,905
I knew it from the
moment I met you.

1090
01:21:20,328 --> 01:21:22,622
(eerie tones)

1091
01:21:41,141 --> 01:21:43,809
- Don't.

1092
01:21:43,810 --> 01:21:45,937
Don't look at me that way.

1093
01:21:47,397 --> 01:21:51,401
- I never really believed
this would happen for me.

1094
01:21:54,821 --> 01:21:57,324
- I wish we had never met.

1095
01:21:57,657 --> 01:21:59,201
- You don't mean that.

1096
01:22:14,341 --> 01:22:17,427
- God look at her, she acts
like she has no will of her own.

1097
01:22:27,312 --> 01:22:29,189
Oh, yes, that's nice.

1098
01:22:29,523 --> 01:22:31,316
Vampire foreplay.

1099
01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:33,276
Go on, go on, bite her, bite.

1100
01:22:33,610 --> 01:22:36,238
No, damn it, you gotta bite her!

1101
01:22:36,571 --> 01:22:37,822
Yeah, maybe now.

1102
01:22:37,823 --> 01:22:39,199
Maybe, come on, bite her.

1103
01:22:39,533 --> 01:22:42,702
Yes, yes, once in the
thrall of the beast,

1104
01:22:43,912 --> 01:22:46,832
you're a blood
slave, nothing more.

1105
01:22:47,165 --> 01:22:49,292
(chuckles)

1106
01:22:55,966 --> 01:22:58,635
But he hasn't even
bitten her yet.

1107
01:23:07,519 --> 01:23:09,062
Yeah, maybe now.

1108
01:23:09,396 --> 01:23:11,273
Maybe he'll bite her now.

1109
01:23:15,485 --> 01:23:18,572
(Lori breathes heavily)

1110
01:23:23,618 --> 01:23:26,371
(ominous music)

1111
01:23:28,999 --> 01:23:31,543
(Lori laughs)

1112
01:23:32,586 --> 01:23:33,962
Oh, my God.

1113
01:23:34,296 --> 01:23:35,839
She's one of 'em, too.

1114
01:24:11,541 --> 01:24:13,460
- I couldn't have hoped.

1115
01:24:15,045 --> 01:24:16,379
- Never go away.

1116
01:24:21,593 --> 01:24:23,511
(sighs)

1117
01:24:40,445 --> 01:24:41,655
- You need blood.

1118
01:24:43,740 --> 01:24:46,284
(tense music)

1119
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:50,121
- Oh, my God.

1120
01:24:51,456 --> 01:24:52,457
Son of a bitch!

1121
01:24:56,294 --> 01:25:01,174
(door clangs)
(concrete rumbles)

1122
01:25:22,195 --> 01:25:24,239
(grunts)

1123
01:25:26,866 --> 01:25:28,201
(grunts)

1124
01:25:28,535 --> 01:25:30,370
(groans)

1125
01:25:30,704 --> 01:25:32,956
(steel clinks)

1126
01:25:34,457 --> 01:25:35,666
(screams)

1127
01:25:35,667 --> 01:25:40,213
(glass shatters)
(groans)

1128
01:25:48,555 --> 01:25:51,349
(grunts)

1129
01:25:51,683 --> 01:25:53,310
(groans)

1130
01:25:57,230 --> 01:25:59,232
(groans)

1131
01:26:07,198 --> 01:26:09,200
(grunts)

1132
01:26:13,204 --> 01:26:15,206
(groans)

1133
01:26:22,547 --> 01:26:24,507

1134
01:26:25,884 --> 01:26:27,886

1135

1136
01:26:41,608 --> 01:26:44,360
Jesus.

1137
01:26:44,361 --> 01:26:46,488
What a fuckin' nightmare.

1138
01:26:46,821 --> 01:26:48,907
(laughs)

1139
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:51,159
(groans)

1140
01:27:02,879 --> 01:27:04,255
(ominous music)

1141
01:27:04,589 --> 01:27:06,548
No!

1142
01:27:06,549 --> 01:27:13,889
No!

1143
01:27:13,890 --> 01:27:14,848
Sit down, gentlemen.

1144
01:27:14,849 --> 01:27:16,476
Please, please sit down.

1145
01:27:16,810 --> 01:27:19,312
What you are about to see
is one of the most dramatic

1146
01:27:19,646 --> 01:27:23,775
pieces of video art that
has ever been created.

1147
01:27:24,109 --> 01:27:27,028
Mr. Oswald, will you
please hold still?

1148
01:27:27,362 --> 01:27:30,532
It is a work of true
conviction, of true commitment,

1149
01:27:30,865 --> 01:27:34,661
and years and years of
single-minded dedication.

1150
01:27:36,246 --> 01:27:39,207
Now, you might ask,
"what is conviction?"

1151
01:27:39,541 --> 01:27:41,668
Conviction is sacrifice.

1152
01:27:42,001 --> 01:27:43,294
"What is commitment?"

1153
01:27:43,628 --> 01:27:45,880
Commitment is sacrifice!

1154
01:27:46,214 --> 01:27:47,381
"What is dedication?"

1155
01:27:47,382 --> 01:27:49,342
Dedication is sacrifice.

1156
01:27:49,676 --> 01:27:50,969
And finally, you might say--

1157
01:27:51,302 --> 01:27:54,055
- [PA System] Dr. Lang to
orthopedics, west wing.

1158
01:27:54,389 --> 01:27:57,058
Dr. Lang to
orthopedics, west wing.

1159
01:27:59,394 --> 01:28:00,686
- And no one, gentlemen,

1160
01:28:00,687 --> 01:28:03,356
no one understands
that better than me.

1161
01:28:09,028 --> 01:28:12,449
There, that's your
key scene, Mr. Oswald!

1162
01:28:15,618 --> 01:28:17,078
Now, pay attention,

1163
01:28:17,412 --> 01:28:18,620
'cause they can screw with
these tapes magnetically.

1164
01:28:18,621 --> 01:28:20,790
Oh, yeah, they can do that.

1165
01:28:21,124 --> 01:28:22,208
Yeah, see, see?

1166
01:28:22,542 --> 01:28:24,294
Bullet hits, right through the
chest, but it doesn't matter.

1167
01:28:24,627 --> 01:28:28,381
You can shoot these son
of a bitches all day long.

1168
01:28:28,715 --> 01:28:30,383
What's the matter,
am I boring you?

1169
01:28:30,717 --> 01:28:31,884
Well, how's this, huh,
look what they did to me.

1170
01:28:31,885 --> 01:28:33,887
These are vampire bites!

1171
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:35,221
(Oswald grunts)

1172
01:28:35,555 --> 01:28:36,805
No, no, no, please
don't take 'em.

1173
01:28:36,806 --> 01:28:39,058
I'm just gettin'
to the primo stuff.

1174
01:28:39,392 --> 01:28:40,601
This is where this guy, Michael,

1175
01:28:40,602 --> 01:28:43,605
actually turns
into a mutant bat!

1176
01:28:43,938 --> 01:28:47,317
I mean, look at it, for
Christ sake, look at that!

1177
01:28:47,650 --> 01:28:50,028
I actually had footage
of him changing,

1178
01:28:50,361 --> 01:28:52,363
and then rising from the dead.

1179
01:28:52,697 --> 01:28:54,991
(Oswald grunts wildly)

1180
01:28:55,325 --> 01:28:56,659
(chuckles)

1181
01:28:56,993 --> 01:28:59,496
Got footage of him
making love, Mr. Oswald.

1182
01:28:59,829 --> 01:29:01,122
(chuckles)
(Oswald grunts)

1183
01:29:01,456 --> 01:29:03,791
X-rated love scenes, Mr. Oswald.

1184
01:29:04,125 --> 01:29:08,880
(laughs)
(Oswald grunts wildly)

1185
01:29:09,923 --> 01:29:12,008
I'm going to like it here.

1186
01:29:16,971 --> 01:29:18,890

(ominous music)

1189
01:29:36,241 --> 01:29:38,785
Look, I wasn't saying
nothing bad about you.

1190
01:29:39,118 --> 01:29:41,495
No.

1191
01:29:41,496 --> 01:29:44,457
I mean, we were just
watching the film, okay?

1192
01:29:47,544 --> 01:29:48,753
It's kinda like we're
friends, you know?

1193
01:29:49,087 --> 01:29:50,922
I mean, we've been
through things together.

1194
01:29:51,256 --> 01:29:53,424
Sort of like friends, right?

1195
01:29:54,717 --> 01:29:58,346
I mean, we were just
watching the film, it's...

1196
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:07,437
Okay?

1197
01:30:07,438 --> 01:30:10,066
(chuckles)

1198
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:11,401
