1
00:00:30,172 --> 00:00:33,938
It's not you chose Ibiza.

2
00:00:34,099 --> 00:00:35,250
What, it's not.

3
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:37,531
You chose to Ibiza.

4
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,422
Ms. ahead.

5
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:39,094
- Doctor, but she squeaks. 
- But you Pariente, barely heard.

6
00:02:39,255 --> 00:02:42,750
A creaking will disappear with time, 
only you need to walk a lot.

7
00:02:42,911 --> 00:02:44,922
Come on, let your moves ...

8
00:02:47,703 --> 00:02:52,266
And please, creaking weakening.

9
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:57,390
- When do I get a new prosthesis? 
- for 6 to 8 months. A maximum of 12.

10
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:01,734
This product manual from Karlsruhe. 
The prosthesis for a lifetime, German quality!

11
00:03:01,895 --> 00:03:06,578
- Goodbye, Doctor. 
- Goodbye, Mrs. Pariente, good luck.

12
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,813
And please be careful on the steps!

13
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:11,688
Eight weeks waiting for a prosthesis? 
It's a scandal!

14
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:12,922
I do not agree with you.

15
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:16,297
As this goes on, I order a prosthesis 
from Germany, I have contacts in Karlsruhe ...

16
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:18,453
It certainly lasted much longer, 
Mr. Damien.

17
00:03:18,614 --> 00:03:20,531
Maybe so, but the quality 
would be better.

18
00:03:20,692 --> 00:03:22,516
Such a prosthesis would be much more expensive.

19
00:03:22,677 --> 00:03:24,942
It zszedłbym the margin, Ms. Tang.

20
00:03:27,926 --> 00:03:29,489
Carole, are you here?

21
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,489
I wanted to surprise you.

22
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,839
I have a meeting in the area, 
drop you?

23
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,183
With pleasure!

24
00:03:35,347 --> 00:03:38,644
I hear nothing, Ms. Tang. 
It's raining cats and dogs!

25
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:47,472
But here's the trash, darling!

26
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:50,066
I know, honey. I do not have the time 
or inclination to clean.

27
00:03:50,227 --> 00:03:53,300
Well, let them lies.

28
00:03:53,461 --> 00:03:56,409
- Kiss? 
- Sure, but look at the way!

29
00:03:58,659 --> 00:03:59,847
It's from high school.

30
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:05,066
Or maybe better call me back for a moment? 
Phone stares you three points.

31
00:04:05,566 --> 00:04:07,769
It's probably the director, this bastard ... 
Excuse me?

32
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,941
Good day. Your son just 
kicked a younger colleague.

33
00:04:11,102 --> 00:04:12,003
What?

34
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:14,613
- How he is kicked? 
- He kicked him with full force!

35
00:04:14,774 --> 00:04:16,952
- He does not behave like this! 
- Oh, that is my fault too?

36
00:04:16,977 --> 00:04:19,117
I'm not talking, 
it's the school's fault ...

37
00:04:19,278 --> 00:04:20,961
Be careful, you will enter into it!

38
00:04:21,867 --> 00:04:24,133
Okay, I'm going after him.

39
00:04:25,117 --> 00:04:26,695
It was close...

40
00:04:27,992 --> 00:04:29,492
This Menace? 
It is aggressive?

41
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:32,648
No, not at all. 
But since divorce is uneasy.

42
00:04:32,809 --> 00:04:34,695
Well ... View the father of 24-year-old bartender ...

43
00:04:34,856 --> 00:04:38,102
- has the right to shake a baby. 
- Of course, otherwise it will pass!

44
00:04:38,263 --> 00:04:41,461
Your children will see us together, 
happy,

45
00:04:41,852 --> 00:04:43,320
you will see that you will feel better.

46
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:46,414
As further will be so bimbać, 
it does not pass the exam.

47
00:04:46,575 --> 00:04:48,992
Well, they are amendments. 
I need to stop worrying.

48
00:04:49,153 --> 00:04:51,653
Do not give up! 
And do not let him continue in defeat.

49
00:04:51,814 --> 00:04:55,356
It's bad for him, for you ... 
And even bad for ...

50
00:04:55,517 --> 00:04:56,622
Be careful, right!

51
00:04:56,783 --> 00:04:59,075
- You were almost dostawczaka! 
- Excuse me! Yes I know...

52
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:02,278
Dostawczak, a little hair! 
About almost dostawczaka.

53
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:04,825
I know, I'm sorry. Listened with attention ...

54
00:05:04,986 --> 00:05:07,263
- Blow me here ... 
- Here?

55
00:05:10,028 --> 00:05:14,113
- Yes Yes. A short walk will not hurt me. 
- OKAY. Wait, now I turn ... I've been.

56
00:05:14,273 --> 00:05:15,997
Yet I do not feel confident 
in the car.

57
00:05:16,158 --> 00:05:17,481
I realized.

58
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,872
Thank you sweetie.

59
00:05:21,841 --> 00:05:25,325
Or maybe we will go together on the weekend 
for my parents to Crotoy?

60
00:05:25,486 --> 00:05:29,013
Finally, we would all know.

61
00:05:29,174 --> 00:05:30,419
Where?

62
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,653
Do Crotoy.

63
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:35,419
- Crotoy? Where it is? 
- Bay Sommijska, sound familiar?

64
00:05:35,653 --> 00:05:37,903
They like, it will be great.

65
00:05:38,064 --> 00:05:41,356
But once your parents? 
Philip, teenagers ...

66
00:05:41,794 --> 00:05:44,122
Do not worry, parents 
love young people.

67
00:05:44,283 --> 00:05:45,403
And they are very receptive.

68
00:05:45,564 --> 00:05:47,138
- I'll talk to them. 
- Bye Baby,

69
00:05:48,372 --> 00:05:49,685
- Get out. 
- Have a good day!

70
00:05:49,846 --> 00:05:51,481
Oh, and almost threw up.

71
00:06:03,924 --> 00:06:05,705
How to turn it off?

72
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:08,970
Mom!

73
00:06:09,854 --> 00:06:11,151
Mom, chill,

74
00:06:13,026 --> 00:06:14,667
You could cause an accident.

75
00:06:14,828 --> 00:06:17,307
Julien, do not say today that tone, 
with his grace.

76
00:06:17,468 --> 00:06:21,135
Be nice to Philip and his parents 
are good people.

77
00:06:21,296 --> 00:06:22,854
And you know the kind of old?

78
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:26,104
I do not know yet, but I know 
that they like each other.

79
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:29,151
You have to know that I care, 
that everything went well.

80
00:06:30,214 --> 00:06:31,901
- Can I turn the muse? 
- No.

81
00:06:33,182 --> 00:06:34,807
For the moment we arrive.

82
00:06:34,968 --> 00:06:36,510
But wiocha ...

83
00:06:50,813 --> 00:06:53,296
I forgot to warn you, 
father Philip is deaf.

84
00:06:53,457 --> 00:06:55,093
It is better to speak to him loudly.

85
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:01,733
- Good morning everyone! 
- Good morning sir!

86
00:07:01,894 --> 00:07:02,935
Why are you tearing up?

87
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,875
You do not have to scream so. Meet 
Philip, he is not deaf!

88
00:07:06,036 --> 00:07:08,734
- There is a lot older than my dad! 
- No. Massacre.

89
00:07:10,515 --> 00:07:13,578
Pleased to meet you, kids!

90
00:07:15,265 --> 00:07:17,218
Come,

91
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:19,756
Come inside ...

92
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:23,667
Drizzling a little bit, but then go!

93
00:07:23,813 --> 00:07:25,438
I would not call this drizzle.

94
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:30,557
The weather at the dog ... We have bad luck!

95
00:07:31,188 --> 00:07:33,453
But the nonsense, I wanted to finally 
dust off the board!

96
00:07:33,614 --> 00:07:35,938
NESKA? As he wants, then he zaparzymy!

97
00:07:36,098 --> 00:07:38,390
Board, not instant, Dad!

98
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,671
I did chamomile!

99
00:07:40,832 --> 00:07:41,593
Mom, help.

100
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,538
Some weed ...

101
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:43,949
Just a joke.

102
00:07:46,053 --> 00:07:47,969
Once we get out 
of this shithole?

103
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:51,850
9 and a double score for the word, 
together 18. Bravo.

104
00:07:52,011 --> 00:07:54,553
Carole, and where you work?

105
00:07:54,714 --> 00:07:56,881
I ran a restaurant with her ex-husband.

106
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:59,261
Ah, the cook!

107
00:07:59,964 --> 00:08:03,464
You are right, they say, 
that through the stomach to the heart!

108
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:07,511
I think by the liver. 
He left me for a chick from the bar.

109
00:08:10,745 --> 00:08:14,057
- I'm sorry ... 
- But that's old news!

110
00:08:14,218 --> 00:08:17,604
Let's focus on the game, OK? 
Your turn, dear.

111
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:20,745
- Mom, when are we going? 
- Julien, hang up the phone

112
00:08:20,906 --> 00:08:23,464
Come and help me, because I totally 
have no idea!

113
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,995
Julien is good at Scrabble?

114
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:28,901
Such letters have.

115
00:08:29,745 --> 00:08:31,932
- and not super. 
- Serious?

116
00:08:32,093 --> 00:08:34,167
Maybe I'll win this round!

117
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,636
We here, please: FELATIO.

118
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:38,917
Felatio?

119
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,089
So.

120
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,057
- But it is in the dictionary, right? 
- Maybe vulgar words in the dictionary.

121
00:08:45,307 --> 00:08:47,417
But like anything, with two "l".

122
00:08:47,578 --> 00:08:50,526
- You want to check? 
- There's no need to! It is true,

123
00:08:50,776 --> 00:08:54,964
There should be two "l" ... 
not clearing up.

124
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,917
Threads of the weather today.

125
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:00,745
And we have emergency options 
in case of rain?

126
00:09:00,906 --> 00:09:02,917
Of course,

127
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:08,198
we have everything in place!

128
00:09:09,698 --> 00:09:12,042
Oh, great ...

129
00:09:12,417 --> 00:09:14,839
Firing in the fireplace, 
the kids will enjoy.

130
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,604
- They come home! 
- Why to Lyon?

131
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:19,511
Lyon are the same!

132
00:09:19,672 --> 00:09:22,511
Forgive me for this disaster. 
The holiday will be better!

133
00:09:22,672 --> 00:09:25,901
It's not your fault! And Julien fail his 
high school diploma and go nowhere.

134
00:09:26,063 --> 00:09:29,979
And I believe that it passes. 
We spend a beautiful vacation together!

135
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,229
Honey, I've tried everything.

136
00:09:33,011 --> 00:09:34,823
OK, I am going.

137
00:09:34,989 --> 00:09:36,822
This arrangement Empire with him!

138
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,208
How to pass the final exams, will be able to choose 
where we're going.

139
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:43,207
We have done so once, 
the young got a red bar ...

140
00:09:43,368 --> 00:09:45,332
and we drove to Bulgaria!

141
00:09:45,493 --> 00:09:48,442
Trust him! Maybe it will be the 
best vacation?

142
00:09:49,442 --> 00:09:51,207
- Mom! 
- He is going!

143
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:55,082
Philip, quick!

144
00:09:55,243 --> 00:09:57,489
Father rug burns!

145
00:09:57,707 --> 00:09:59,067
Pled?

146
00:10:00,582 --> 00:10:03,676
After all, I forbid you to give 
him this rug!

147
00:10:03,841 --> 00:10:05,857
Blank cottage with smoke!

148
00:10:06,018 --> 00:10:07,732
Quick, water!

149
00:10:22,685 --> 00:10:24,263
- And? 
- I passed, Mom.

150
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:27,326
Well done, darling! I told you. 
I'm so proud.

151
00:10:27,488 --> 00:10:31,279
Me too! But the jaram! 
You want to know what the left?

152
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,107
- I passed! 
- Ingeniously.

153
00:10:33,904 --> 00:10:37,544
- Ibiza, dude! But the tarry! 
- Ibiza? You have chosen Ibiza?

154
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:40,482
- So nice? 
- Ideal! Cool!

155
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,154
- I am very pleased Julus! 
- Me too.

156
00:10:44,013 --> 00:10:46,107
Come on, have a drink champagne!

157
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,915
- Have fun on vacation, Sophie. 
- I wish you the same, Doctor.

158
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,919
Already going? 
There will drink after rozchodniaczku?

159
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,404
I have no time! At 5 we are 
flying out to Thailand.

160
00:10:58,565 --> 00:11:00,055
And yet I'm not even packed.

161
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,544
And as Ibiza, 
you have not changed your mind?

162
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:05,268
There's no way I'm going there! 
Carole will understand ...

163
00:11:05,433 --> 00:11:11,013
I am on the island of junkies and eternal events? 
I jump into techno and take ecstasy?

164
00:11:11,173 --> 00:11:12,277
Thank you!

165
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,855
Listen, 3 or 4 years ago 
we were there with Pauline.

166
00:11:15,638 --> 00:11:17,730
We were delighted. 
Something łyknęliśmy, it's true ...

167
00:11:17,891 --> 00:11:20,474
but then we popped up in the morning the night. 
Nothing else did!

168
00:11:20,657 --> 00:11:22,548
After returning I slept for a week!

169
00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:25,313
Holidays by osteopath, huh? 
Envy!

170
00:11:25,844 --> 00:11:27,579
You're right, this is not for you.

171
00:11:27,766 --> 00:11:29,032
You're too ...

172
00:11:29,193 --> 00:11:31,766
- Too what? 
- too so ...

173
00:11:34,407 --> 00:11:36,907
Well, no crazy ...

174
00:11:37,891 --> 00:11:40,048
- It's where you go? 
- To Crotoy.

175
00:11:41,626 --> 00:11:43,938
Holidays by podologa, 
envy!

176
00:11:45,792 --> 00:11:47,406
Bye, see you.

177
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:50,376
Dupe.

178
00:12:00,657 --> 00:12:02,048
Hat?

179
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:04,110
Piżamka?

180
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,771
And sometimes even hail in northern France 
and in the Bay of Somme,

181
00:12:10,932 --> 00:12:14,318
temperatures there will be 
definitely the lowest.

182
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:16,838
19 degrees in the shade

183
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:19,579
Come with us, it will be great! 
I'll miss you!

184
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,891
Such temperature 
is not recorded since 1952.

185
00:12:40,032 --> 00:12:42,829
Sit back, uparciuszek because you 
do not want to change places!

186
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:46,610
I beg your pardon, I bought a ticket 
at the last minute ...

187
00:12:46,771 --> 00:12:50,829
government have a place for you. 
As you can see, this family trip.

188
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:53,376
- Would you like to, you're not my father! 
- Julien, shut up!

189
00:12:53,538 --> 00:12:56,891
I paid 12 euros for this place 
and I'll sit here, okay ?!

190
00:12:57,157 --> 00:12:58,360
I understand,

191
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,720
- 12 euros is not przelewki. 
- You're kidding me?

192
00:13:02,141 --> 00:13:03,938
You want to get out?

193
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:08,891
- Can I help you gentlemen?

194
00:13:10,282 --> 00:13:13,673
Relax, it's finally a breeze. 
And I do not like aggression.

195
00:13:13,891 --> 00:13:16,360
I'll sit in the back, it's only 
two hours flight.

196
00:13:17,266 --> 00:13:20,220
In any case, I thank you sincerely.

197
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:28,579
Good day.

198
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,673
- Good morning. 
- Romeo, nice.

199
00:13:32,204 --> 00:13:37,298
Dear passengers, 
find your pilot, Enrique Jimenez.

200
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:40,298
Zone of turbulence ahead

201
00:13:43,766 --> 00:13:46,673
- Bebidas? 
- Nada, only fly in one piece.

202
00:13:46,834 --> 00:13:48,720
Honey, are you afraid? 
Relanium want?

203
00:13:48,881 --> 00:13:51,464
- Do not comforted me! 
- Excuse me.

204
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,720
- We perish! 
- Mom, calm down! You're scaring people!

205
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:04,815
Honey, it's only air hole! 
Spectacular, but nothing to worry about,

206
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,945
It is a matter of difference in temperature, 
pure physics.

207
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,970
Go play Scrabble with my parents 
and do not talk to me anymore!

208
00:14:10,138 --> 00:14:13,216
He says that because recently 
we played with my parents.

209
00:14:13,377 --> 00:14:14,794
I do not care, shut up!

210
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,875
Ladies and gentlemen, 
the zone of turbulence is behind us.

211
00:14:20,201 --> 00:14:23,373
Sweetheart? 
However, I want to Relanium.

212
00:14:26,638 --> 00:14:29,529
Welcome to Ibiza

213
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,951
welcome to the party!

214
00:14:32,341 --> 00:14:36,670
It is said here that it is not you 
going to Ibiza,

215
00:14:36,831 --> 00:14:39,373
This Ibiza chooses you.

216
00:14:39,752 --> 00:14:42,581
I could warn you, 
on the plane I am not myself.

217
00:14:42,988 --> 00:14:45,363
I'm so glad, however, that 
you are here with us ...

218
00:14:45,523 --> 00:14:46,721
I love you.

219
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,617
I love you too.

220
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,351
You and your phobias.

221
00:14:51,513 --> 00:14:55,663
You know, that such problems can be 
worked in the simulator ...

222
00:14:56,074 --> 00:14:59,324
You no more have to 
shake with fear.

223
00:14:59,485 --> 00:15:03,074
- This ship will sail. 
- Yes, and seasickness?

224
00:15:03,574 --> 00:15:06,309
You do not have seasickness?

225
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:08,449
- I have. 
- Exactly...

226
00:15:10,528 --> 00:15:11,856
How well do you get out of the sun!

227
00:15:12,017 --> 00:15:15,013
Watch out, it sub-Saharan climate. 
The sun is dangerous here.

228
00:15:15,173 --> 00:15:17,263
Dangerous, kids!

229
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:25,246
Honey what are you doing?

230
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:27,574
I'm looking for sunglasses, 
as soon as you catch up.

231
00:15:37,032 --> 00:15:39,126
Or better police?

232
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,454
I do not believe, Carole! 
This is madness.

233
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,734
A type of just 
offering me coke!

234
00:15:47,109 --> 00:15:50,500
- Not bad for a start! 
- But did you all?

235
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:55,750
Do not forget that Edith fled 
Goa with yoga instructor

236
00:15:55,911 --> 00:16:00,797
smoke turns from morning to night. 
It is for me a little touchy subject.

237
00:16:06,328 --> 00:16:09,203
No ... They are not interested! 
It even children!

238
00:16:18,688 --> 00:16:21,578
- Irritable about, darling. 
- Charles? Fiat 500?

239
00:16:21,739 --> 00:16:23,891
Thus, the Fiat 500's us!

240
00:16:25,438 --> 00:16:28,406
Seriously, wynajęłaś Fiat 500? 
But down! There will put up!

241
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:30,109
Julien will be well, 
we can do it!

242
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,047
Honey, I have a card 
American Express ...

243
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,313
we can raise the standard.

244
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:40,719
- I speak French. 
- It's praises!

245
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:44,156
Council could raise the standard car?

246
00:16:44,317 --> 00:16:46,344
- I picked up a Hummer. 
- What?

247
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,250
Hummer, yes, but grazing!

248
00:16:48,563 --> 00:16:51,234
- Julien! This is not a car for us! 
- Why?

249
00:16:51,395 --> 00:16:54,453
What's so special? 
It's some bigger combo?

250
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,458
Ah. Indeed, such 
a little bigger combo.

251
00:17:07,516 --> 00:17:08,984
What we have here ...

252
00:17:09,145 --> 00:17:12,344
This is probably the reversing camera.

253
00:17:12,505 --> 00:17:16,063
- Do you want to enter the address in the GPS? 
- Sure thing.

254
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,344
I'm not bother you?!

255
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:20,046
Of course not!

256
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:24,125
Here we have the memory of the driver's seat.

257
00:17:24,286 --> 00:17:27,047
What is he doing! 
What's happening?

258
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,813
What are you doing?

259
00:17:28,974 --> 00:17:31,609
Mom, do something! Crush my legs!

260
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,938
I can not unlock! Help me! 
It's all under control.

261
00:17:35,098 --> 00:17:36,609
- Stop it! 
- I do not know how!

262
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,730
I have a steering wheel in your stomach!

263
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,031
- Stop! 
- I can not!

264
00:17:41,192 --> 00:17:43,234
- It's okay. 
- Well, can we go?

265
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,750
Wait a minute, wait a Bringing your. 
And now, most importantly,

266
00:17:46,911 --> 00:17:50,828
without it there we go - music!

267
00:17:50,989 --> 00:17:55,219
In the end, good music on leave 
is a matter of the first importance.

268
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,281
Look now ...

269
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:03,016
A little too loud, 
too loud. And what a good muse?

270
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:04,500
but shit

271
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,448
iPod z 1850!

272
00:18:07,125 --> 00:18:09,109
Go, sheep!

273
00:18:14,484 --> 00:18:16,078
But grandpa is dispersed

274
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:17,578
12 km / h!

275
00:18:17,739 --> 00:18:20,750
Kids leave these phones, 
we're on vacation!

276
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:24,645
- Wow! David Guetta game in Ushuaia! 
- Guetta! It is the only one whose associate!

277
00:18:24,806 --> 00:18:28,317
Ibiza is not only the clubs! 
We'll go north.

278
00:18:28,478 --> 00:18:31,349
There is more wildly, 
authentically.

279
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,849
Especially such a place, 
El Rayo Verde.

280
00:18:37,161 --> 00:18:40,286
- You do not want to know, what is it? 
- What? And, yeah, sure I do.

281
00:18:40,447 --> 00:18:43,458
Thus, El Rayo Verde, 
or "green beam"

282
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:46,786
It is visible for a fraction 
of a second during sunset

283
00:18:46,947 --> 00:18:50,395
- on the horizon ... 
- Just send an SMS father that arrived!

284
00:18:50,556 --> 00:18:52,161
Someone here at all listening?

285
00:18:52,322 --> 00:18:54,286
- No! 
- Oh, yes, dear.

286
00:18:59,942 --> 00:19:02,552
- Do not go too fast. 
- I prefer to avoid fines.

287
00:19:08,364 --> 00:19:12,036
- A piece of the hotel. 
- And we are.

288
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:16,599
Typical Spanish architecture 
from the time of General Franco.

289
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,989
Only concrete, concrete and concrete ...

290
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,974
Knock Knock!

291
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:30,208
Mom, this hollow is a joke!

292
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,489
What do I do! 
In the pictures it looked different.

293
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,099
I want to have your room!

294
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,927
No you do not! 
We are in Ibiza, right on the sea!

295
00:19:37,088 --> 00:19:38,989
Some anywhere 
do not go on vacation!

296
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,005
There is no need to be nervous,

297
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,974
there is still one room! Look!

298
00:19:46,302 --> 00:19:49,489
- And no, it's just storeroom. 
- And well, we have a storeroom on the broom.

299
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,020
And anyway, if someone lives here? 
What's the neighborhood died?

300
00:19:52,181 --> 00:19:55,005
- Stop it, please! 
- Indeed, very quiet here!

301
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:59,723
For me it's OK, but Julien Manon 
may get bored.

302
00:19:59,884 --> 00:20:01,192
Bored?

303
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:04,290
See for this ...

304
00:20:05,368 --> 00:20:06,978
Here you are!

305
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:13,806
TECHNO HAPPY HOUR! 
Every day from 18:00 to 20:00!

306
00:20:13,967 --> 00:20:16,290
What? Every day we hear this ?!

307
00:20:18,368 --> 00:20:21,134
- It's like, the area is better? 
- Thanks mum!

308
00:20:22,338 --> 00:20:24,134
Ogłuchniemy, but whatever.

309
00:20:26,572 --> 00:20:28,915
- Do you like this kind of music? 
- I love!

310
00:20:31,915 --> 00:20:35,165
Well, I've only dream about, 
to lie down.

311
00:20:42,838 --> 00:20:44,290
Is the daily Le Monde?

312
00:20:45,838 --> 00:20:47,088
A Figaro?

313
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:53,963
No? It talked himself.

314
00:20:54,322 --> 00:20:56,103
Soon will die from the heat.

315
00:20:56,264 --> 00:21:00,025
What I'll do about it, 
it's your brother wanted to come here!

316
00:21:00,186 --> 00:21:01,947
But I did not want Shrek.

317
00:21:02,108 --> 00:21:04,233
- Shrek? 
- You heard snoring? Massacre!

318
00:21:04,394 --> 00:21:07,248
- At the age of 6000 years so everyone has. 
- That's enough!

319
00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:09,529
I also do not get enough sleep, 
and I have a good humor,

320
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:13,154
I'm on vacation with children, 
with Philip, the sun is shining!

321
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:15,014
Mom, it is embarrassing.

322
00:21:15,175 --> 00:21:16,597
Not what your daddy!

323
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:20,338
He was so cool that you left 
for some busty idiot!

324
00:21:20,498 --> 00:21:22,473
Mom, please ... This is our father, 
you should not say that in front of us.

325
00:21:22,498 --> 00:21:26,259
Yes! This father and left him! 
And Philip is my guy enough.

326
00:21:27,155 --> 00:21:29,764
What's the skwaszone mines?

327
00:21:30,076 --> 00:21:34,513
I bought a couple of newspapers in Spanish.

328
00:21:34,674 --> 00:21:36,733
It's fun, but I'm busy.

329
00:21:36,967 --> 00:21:39,733
I also go to take care of you, bye!

330
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,561
- Did I say something wrong? 
- You know what they are young.

331
00:21:44,951 --> 00:21:47,076
Well, let's go to the beach, 
I want to take a bath!

332
00:21:47,238 --> 00:21:50,655
- I wypiłbym cup of coffee on the terrace! 
- It's go get a cup of coffee ...

333
00:21:50,816 --> 00:21:52,889
- join me later. 
- Well.

334
00:21:54,152 --> 00:21:55,808
What a woman ...

335
00:21:58,378 --> 00:21:59,747
Listen?

336
00:21:59,908 --> 00:22:01,766
Get lost, caballero!

337
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:05,125
Carole, it's crazy!

338
00:22:05,733 --> 00:22:09,889
- Again, they wanted to sell me a coke! 
- Can you look koksiarza.

339
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:12,311
What on koksiarza?

340
00:22:13,108 --> 00:22:15,998
Okay, time for a delicious cup of coffee and a newspaper.

341
00:22:38,998 --> 00:22:41,389
And as your brother and this chick, 
on which he insisted?

342
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,014
In life you will not find her.

343
00:22:43,175 --> 00:22:45,795
But he is trying to surprise, as he finds out 
what you're there.

344
00:22:45,956 --> 00:22:47,483
Nothing godmother.

345
00:22:47,644 --> 00:22:51,248
He insisted on this old man 
with a 40-pound iPod.

346
00:22:54,889 --> 00:22:56,420
We have a new collection!

347
00:22:56,585 --> 00:22:58,835
Now, 5 years warranty, amigo.

348
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:06,448
Perhaps the iPhone? Samsung? Pendant? Apap?

349
00:23:06,609 --> 00:23:08,898
I do not need anything. 
Anyway, I have no cash.

350
00:23:11,163 --> 00:23:13,788
No cash, no interlopers!

351
00:23:28,976 --> 00:23:30,820
Wonderful water!

352
00:23:31,132 --> 00:23:34,570
- I think I burned. 
- You think through these glasses.

353
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,897
- Nice look! It's Tom Ford? 
- No.

354
00:23:38,058 --> 00:23:42,523
This Ray-Banosy. Ray-Bans for a tenner. 
Besides, you can not see the difference.

355
00:23:42,684 --> 00:23:47,273
With children baby ... I think 
we have to calm, nothing by force.

356
00:23:47,491 --> 00:23:51,038
- They said something about me? 
- No, I'm just saying.

357
00:23:51,804 --> 00:23:54,116
And if you do not accept me?

358
00:23:55,195 --> 00:23:58,148
It is just impossible.

359
00:23:58,991 --> 00:24:02,835
Thank you, it's beautiful what you say.

360
00:24:07,866 --> 00:24:10,460
What is? 
What are you laughing at?

361
00:24:10,621 --> 00:24:13,320
Honey, you dropped the glass 
and look ridiculous.

362
00:24:13,481 --> 00:24:15,429
Damn, I just bought it!

363
00:24:15,773 --> 00:24:19,273
- Ray-Banosom spoil the quality. 
- But I did not pay much?

364
00:24:19,434 --> 00:24:21,195
No, but still ...

365
00:24:21,356 --> 00:24:22,757
- How much? 
- tenner.

366
00:24:22,918 --> 00:24:26,320
- How so, the glass has the right to go out ... 
- Well, breathes in the mud ...

367
00:24:38,851 --> 00:24:40,554
What is he doing with this phone?

368
00:24:48,335 --> 00:24:51,491
- What did you show? 
- I'm not going with you to talk about it.

369
00:24:51,652 --> 00:24:55,960
Give it a hoax in peace, dear! 
There are holidays, deserved!

370
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:59,257
- Use, kid ... 
- No one bajerowałem!

371
00:24:59,418 --> 00:25:01,148
Just looking for someone,

372
00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:04,679
you happy? It odczepcie. 
And I'm not your kid.

373
00:25:06,226 --> 00:25:08,945
I guess I'm not 
a master of communication.

374
00:25:09,106 --> 00:25:11,601
Did you know that he came here 
to find someone?

375
00:25:11,763 --> 00:25:14,038
No, nothing tells me.

376
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,257
Tara, mamo.

377
00:25:16,418 --> 00:25:17,960
What Tara? Who is this?

378
00:25:18,124 --> 00:25:20,468
Typiara, for which he flew 
from the beginning of the year.

379
00:25:20,629 --> 00:25:23,202
He moved here 
and stopped talking.

380
00:25:24,281 --> 00:25:27,749
That's why Ibiza? 
Why did not you tell me before?

381
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,890
You had to ask!

382
00:25:30,109 --> 00:25:32,046
I am a hopeless mother.

383
00:25:32,207 --> 00:25:34,781
Honey, do not worry, 
we will find this Sarah ...

384
00:25:34,942 --> 00:25:36,624
Tara! Not Sarah!

385
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,563
That's it, we will help him find 
this whole Tara!

386
00:25:39,723 --> 00:25:41,796
What a name, the first time I've heard ...

387
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,640
- All OK? 
- drive me insane.

388
00:25:43,801 --> 00:25:45,624
What are you, the parents.

389
00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:53,535
- This center? 
- Guess.

390
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,692
Not bad!

391
00:26:02,676 --> 00:26:04,832
That's where this is Tara?

392
00:26:06,645 --> 00:26:08,113
Do not pour the collar.

393
00:26:08,274 --> 00:26:11,520
- Behold! This error is not she? 
- She's not drinking.

394
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,660
It is impossible to withstand these your events!

395
00:26:22,473 --> 00:26:26,645
Super atmosphere. She does not have a cell phone?

396
00:26:26,806 --> 00:26:29,457
- You do not have to help me. 
- But I want to Julien. We'll find her.

397
00:26:29,618 --> 00:26:32,942
You say that it is a tiny, tiny ...

398
00:26:33,103 --> 00:26:35,223
Here she is!

399
00:26:36,353 --> 00:26:37,634
Very funny.

400
00:26:37,795 --> 00:26:42,088
Julien! We look, but we can 
also make fun!

401
00:26:44,368 --> 00:26:46,149
Here it probably was not.

402
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,524
- Does not matter. 
- Wait!

403
00:26:48,685 --> 00:26:50,368
Do not give up.

404
00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:53,588
Or maybe this one? 
Come on ...

405
00:26:54,024 --> 00:26:55,993
Wait.

406
00:27:00,024 --> 00:27:04,681
- What's the oddity on wheels? 
- It's hoverboard!

407
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,978
Break his nose, it will not be 
so confident ...

408
00:27:09,493 --> 00:27:11,181
Hey, Frankie!

409
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:16,853
- What pacan doing this? 
- kisses mom?

410
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,805
You here? Welcome to Ibiza!

411
00:27:18,966 --> 00:27:20,759
Give me a number, a bit of a hurry now.

412
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,088
Sure ... 0620214632.

413
00:27:24,248 --> 00:27:26,634
- 46 32 
- Honey, what are you doing?

414
00:27:26,795 --> 00:27:28,681
We're talking, Grandpa, you can not see?

415
00:27:28,842 --> 00:27:31,399
No no! This is my partner 
and my children.

416
00:27:31,542 --> 00:27:33,584
Wow, you're the posters everywhere!

417
00:27:33,745 --> 00:27:35,411
It's me, but I do not like posters.

418
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:38,276
Carole said the same thing at the airport.

419
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:43,458
They are terribly obscene! 
And you did not go well.

420
00:27:43,623 --> 00:27:45,931
- And what do you do for living? 
- I'm Podiatry.

421
00:27:46,092 --> 00:27:48,368
Podo-what? Anyway, the 
poster that you did not take.

422
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:51,884
You know, honey, I know Frankie 
from the times of Lille,

423
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:55,654
old times. 
He ran his own club, Privilege.

424
00:27:55,815 --> 00:27:57,623
Memories come back!

425
00:27:58,201 --> 00:28:00,810
- It was my first club. 
- Mom, go to Ushuaia?

426
00:28:00,998 --> 00:28:02,951
Yes of course.

427
00:28:03,113 --> 00:28:05,139
Provided that dance 
again on the table.

428
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,264
Oh no! Are you crazy? 
It's not for me!

429
00:28:08,425 --> 00:28:10,451
Do not you told me never think about this?

430
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:13,167
- I wonder why? 
- Stop.

431
00:28:13,328 --> 00:28:17,956
It's nice talking to you, but please 
go back to the skateboard.

432
00:28:18,117 --> 00:28:20,065
- hoverboard! 
- Want to try?

433
00:28:20,226 --> 00:28:23,238
- No, because I'm gonna fire. 
- It did not look easy!

434
00:28:23,398 --> 00:28:27,409
- It's simple, why do not you try? 
- No, it's probably not a good idea!

435
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:31,050
What are you afraid of, darling? 
If he gives you advice!

436
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:34,488
Well skied.

437
00:28:34,648 --> 00:28:37,738
I can do it, I was pretty good skier.

438
00:28:37,898 --> 00:28:42,158
- But it's not the same ... 
- Not the same, and yet!

439
00:28:44,958 --> 00:28:47,205
Nothing hard!

440
00:29:02,003 --> 00:29:03,659
- Mom, long? 
- I do not know.

441
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,195
Do not wait! I'll 
control, and you go.

442
00:29:07,356 --> 00:29:08,409
That we fall.

443
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:11,128
No, we stay here! 
Family sticks together.

444
00:29:11,289 --> 00:29:14,409
- And accidents happen ... 
- It certainly his doing.

445
00:29:14,882 --> 00:29:18,445
These guys are always jealous 
of people like me.

446
00:29:18,606 --> 00:29:21,898
- If you say so. 
- He had it in his face!

447
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:23,445
What's your ticket?

448
00:29:24,023 --> 00:29:25,304
237.

449
00:29:26,757 --> 00:29:28,351
We will spend eternity here.

450
00:29:28,882 --> 00:29:31,549
- What are they? 
- Medusa.

451
00:29:31,708 --> 00:29:33,917
- Sure burns. 
- Ah, that must hurt!

452
00:29:39,523 --> 00:29:42,117
- This is good ... 
- Yeah ... Good ...

453
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:46,382
Very good....

454
00:29:54,867 --> 00:29:56,804
Batman staring at me.

455
00:29:57,336 --> 00:29:59,023
I feel trapped ...

456
00:30:00,148 --> 00:30:02,492
And Jimi Hendrix is ​​...

457
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,226
I think not only I tore off today ...

458
00:30:13,507 --> 00:30:16,101
- And to what? 
- What does he want?

459
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:21,554
It's getting dangerous, we go from here.

460
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:23,929
Junkies everywhere ...

461
00:30:26,667 --> 00:30:29,042
- All OK? 
- Yes Yes...

462
00:30:32,961 --> 00:30:34,851
Mom, I'm going to the club to look for Tara.

463
00:30:35,461 --> 00:30:37,664
To the club? It is already eighteenth!

464
00:30:37,825 --> 00:30:39,351
At this time of opening.

465
00:30:39,513 --> 00:30:43,164
No way! You saw today what I? 
I'm not going to go back to the emergency room.

466
00:30:43,325 --> 00:30:45,617
Mom! I'm smart enough, 
so as not doing drugs ...

467
00:30:45,778 --> 00:30:47,054
Sweetheart...

468
00:30:47,664 --> 00:30:50,820
I met him a little longer, 
it sensible boy.

469
00:30:50,981 --> 00:30:53,367
It is love, give him a chance to 
find this girl.

470
00:30:53,528 --> 00:30:56,101
And if it's the only one? 
Worth looking for love life.

471
00:30:56,263 --> 00:30:58,586
For example, I failed!

472
00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:01,554
What are you talking about? I'm not the 
woman of your life?

473
00:31:01,742 --> 00:31:05,694
Oh yes ... That's not what I meant! 
I mean...

474
00:31:05,855 --> 00:31:08,695
the first half of my life.

475
00:31:08,856 --> 00:31:13,070
This does not mean, after all, 
that the second half is not successful.

476
00:31:13,231 --> 00:31:17,851
Honey, do not torment me now, 
I'm all battered.

477
00:31:18,013 --> 00:31:20,586
- All right, let it be 22:00. 
- Thanks mum!

478
00:31:20,747 --> 00:31:22,242
You do not want to go too?

479
00:31:22,403 --> 00:31:24,820
Oh, no, honey! I dream already 
about to lie down!

480
00:31:24,981 --> 00:31:28,226
Oh no! I do not go to sleep at 18:00, 
I'm not a baby!

481
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:30,429
Zmówiliście we all ?!

482
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:33,257
OK, but do not you go outside the complex!

483
00:31:33,418 --> 00:31:34,632
Thanks.

484
00:31:35,117 --> 00:31:36,773
We trust you, Manon.

485
00:31:37,789 --> 00:31:39,336
Come on, baby.

486
00:31:39,601 --> 00:31:41,914
- gate valve, gate! 
- Shut up!

487
00:31:42,075 --> 00:31:43,351
Moron...

488
00:31:44,273 --> 00:31:45,398
I have!

489
00:31:46,132 --> 00:31:49,523
- I'm going to take a shower, you wait? 
- All my life, if need be.

490
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:52,164
And tell ...

491
00:31:52,851 --> 00:31:55,664
Not that I was jealous, but ...

492
00:31:55,825 --> 00:31:59,164
There was something between you 
and the typkiem of skateboards?

493
00:31:59,325 --> 00:32:00,820
No! How did you come to that?

494
00:32:00,981 --> 00:32:04,257
He said that you were together 
very close ...

495
00:32:04,429 --> 00:32:06,804
Yes, but as pals.

496
00:32:06,965 --> 00:32:09,961
Phew ... That's good, because it would be me 
with this strange.

497
00:32:10,122 --> 00:32:12,054
Frankly, it looks 
to the limited.

498
00:32:12,226 --> 00:32:14,297
The genius of this might not be, but it is nice.

499
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:18,708
- Do not genius? Rather mediocrity! 
- He's nice...

500
00:32:19,708 --> 00:32:22,541
- Entry 50 euros. 
- I do not have enough. But I know Frankie!

501
00:32:22,702 --> 00:32:26,427
- Yeah, everybody knows him. Get lost already. 
- It's my mom's ex.

502
00:32:26,588 --> 00:32:30,271
This ex everyone. 
Come on!

503
00:32:50,724 --> 00:32:51,766
Mama?

504
00:32:51,915 --> 00:32:54,286
- Mom, do you hear? 
- Wait a minute ...

505
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,708
Mother?

506
00:32:57,869 --> 00:32:59,130
Wait!

507
00:33:02,708 --> 00:33:03,896
Where are you?

508
00:33:04,057 --> 00:33:06,516
In Ushuaia, they do not want to let me in! 
You call your ex?

509
00:33:06,541 --> 00:33:08,317
This is not my ex!

510
00:33:08,478 --> 00:33:10,213
- Julien, come back soon! 
- No!

511
00:33:10,374 --> 00:33:13,197
Tara is definitely here! 
You promised to help me!

512
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:19,900
- Okay, I'll come there. 
- Thank you, Mom.

513
00:33:21,322 --> 00:33:23,353
But wieśniackie name.

514
00:33:23,514 --> 00:33:26,369
Seriously? And I think 
that Jordan is sweet.

515
00:33:26,603 --> 00:33:29,916
And it's cool, so why 
would I not do it?

516
00:33:30,077 --> 00:33:32,910
Mom? 
You are going out? I'm going with you.

517
00:33:33,071 --> 00:33:35,446
No! Go back to your room and do not make noise. 
Filip asleep.

518
00:33:35,607 --> 00:33:37,914
- And when she wakes up? 
- Tell him not to worry.

519
00:33:38,075 --> 00:33:39,836
So you do not remember, 
how ubrałaś ...

520
00:33:39,997 --> 00:33:43,305
Yes! No! Calm him somehow simply. 
I'm going.

521
00:33:48,497 --> 00:33:50,654
- All OK? 
- Yeah, great ... And you?

522
00:33:50,815 --> 00:33:54,544
- Fine. What are you doing? 
- A total of nothing ...

523
00:33:55,044 --> 00:33:56,810
- And you? 
- Nothing ...

524
00:33:57,294 --> 00:33:58,529
Cool.

525
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,997
But stick with you!

526
00:34:19,158 --> 00:34:21,982
Thanks ... I love how you're 
so horny!

527
00:34:23,611 --> 00:34:27,829
Throw away those two guys, 
they do smoke there!

528
00:34:28,625 --> 00:34:30,949
Damn, not a moment of peace!

529
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:36,580
- Frankie, I'm in front of the club. 
- What? Here?

530
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,407
Yes, it is by a son, 
I will explain everything to you ...

531
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,049
Wait, I'll give you to the VIP area, 
only keeper I call ...

532
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:43,018
Louder, I can not hear!

533
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:44,888
- What are you wearing? 
- On red.

534
00:34:45,048 --> 00:34:47,596
I throw myself in the eye. 
Julien!

535
00:34:48,565 --> 00:34:50,893
- All OK? 
- Wow, what a suit!

536
00:34:51,054 --> 00:34:52,658
- I exaggerated? 
- No, Mum! Grade!

537
00:34:52,819 --> 00:34:53,860
Did you call the former?

538
00:34:54,007 --> 00:34:56,611
Yes, but come on now, 
it's just a buddy, bring us ...

539
00:35:00,726 --> 00:35:05,179
- You're tense, something happened? 
- It fastens in the VIP area.

540
00:35:05,757 --> 00:35:07,288
I'll go help them ...

541
00:35:07,507 --> 00:35:12,007
Oh no! You do not leave me here alone! 
It was supposed to be our night!

542
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:19,335
Mom, what are you doing ?! 
We had to look Tara!

543
00:35:19,496 --> 00:35:21,819
I never find! 
In this crowd?

544
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:25,319
- Sure, get it. I can handle it! 
- Julien? Julien!

545
00:35:25,663 --> 00:35:29,210
I can not! Mr. Słodziak woman! 
All OK?

546
00:35:29,371 --> 00:35:33,616
- You do not get a panic attack? 
- No, I just like them fly.

547
00:35:33,777 --> 00:35:36,272
- Well, because I have no more Relanium. 
- Very funny!

548
00:35:36,433 --> 00:35:37,991
Where podziałaś Słodziak?

549
00:35:38,491 --> 00:35:41,304
- Well, where's your VIP Member? 
- Enough!

550
00:35:43,304 --> 00:35:48,804
Cocaine! Yes! 
Hello, police ?!

551
00:35:54,304 --> 00:35:55,382
Carole?

552
00:36:06,085 --> 00:36:10,585
I do not want you to push 
itself you have to want it ...

553
00:36:10,757 --> 00:36:12,131
Want?

554
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:15,475
- And it hurts a lot? 
- At the beginning, and then you do not ...

555
00:36:17,772 --> 00:36:21,226
Hello, here voicemail Carole ...

556
00:36:34,351 --> 00:36:37,460
- Manon, all right? 
- Yes.

557
00:36:37,621 --> 00:36:40,772
- Do you know where Mom went? 
- She went to the Julien Ushaia.

558
00:36:40,933 --> 00:36:41,975
Co?!

559
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:45,194
Do... Frankiego?!

560
00:36:45,355 --> 00:36:48,507
Oh no, I reassure you ... 
Do not tell my mother that it was me!

561
00:36:48,668 --> 00:36:51,835
By you? 
She ran to the dealer ?!

562
00:36:51,996 --> 00:36:53,444
Yes, I think we need to go after them.

563
00:36:53,605 --> 00:36:55,991
No way! You have 13 years 
and will not go anywhere from here!

564
00:36:56,152 --> 00:36:59,288
- What a pitcher ... 
- What are you talking about, Manon?

565
00:36:59,458 --> 00:37:02,631
I'm going to sleep! Now, you hear?

566
00:37:02,792 --> 00:37:04,538
We would also gladly slept!

567
00:37:04,699 --> 00:37:07,647
It is difficult, here is Ibiza, 
there is not sleeping!

568
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:12,054
Eat to the sanatorium, 
as loud for you!

569
00:37:38,169 --> 00:37:39,888
How's our acrobat?

570
00:37:40,731 --> 00:37:44,013
- Is he all right? 
- Nothing serious, now asleep.

571
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:47,653
In this age, it's probably standard. 
Do not you think?

572
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,809
No, I'm very happy with him. 
I came here after his son.

573
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:56,419
- Your son is playing great now. 
- Not true, looking for his ex.

574
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:59,653
Not only does he. 
Everyone is looking for former today!

575
00:37:59,814 --> 00:38:02,075
Come on, no way!

576
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:06,153
Carole, I still have someone.

577
00:38:06,314 --> 00:38:08,747
But today really 
bad chick with you!

578
00:38:08,908 --> 00:38:11,716
- I do not want to listen to this. 
- Carole?

579
00:38:13,122 --> 00:38:14,559
This is my wife!

580
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:16,934
You good in red ...

581
00:38:17,356 --> 00:38:22,216
- You're still here? 
- Oh, no, have you seen my son?

582
00:38:22,377 --> 00:38:25,856
And what I'm after him? Do not move from here, 
bring a drink! Not a step!

583
00:38:26,017 --> 00:38:29,122
- Who it was? 
- one such friend ...

584
00:38:29,283 --> 00:38:30,497
What are you doing here?

585
00:38:30,658 --> 00:38:33,372
Chrapałeś! Julien could not 
go home.

586
00:38:33,533 --> 00:38:37,841
What? I can not hear, you can turn down? 
Unbearable!

587
00:38:38,002 --> 00:38:40,200
You not downloaded plugs at the entrance?

588
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:41,919
- No. 
- Damn ...

589
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,966
- Frankie, dump him? 
- Wrong.

590
00:38:45,169 --> 00:38:47,200
It is better to give him a lesson.

591
00:38:47,361 --> 00:38:51,184
I say immediately that I abhor aggression, 
I will not defend, no art ...

592
00:38:51,345 --> 00:38:53,856
- There will be no aggression, racuszku. 
- Who's he talking about?

593
00:38:54,017 --> 00:38:58,309
Will you show us what you can afford. 
Let's see what you release muse.

594
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:02,434
- Certainly not the rąbankę! 
- What's your nickname?

595
00:39:02,595 --> 00:39:07,059
- First stage? 
- Dr. F. F Filip.

596
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:10,804
- Here we go with coke! 
- What type of ...

597
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,658
- Dr. F? What it again for tomfoolery? 
- Trust me, honey ...

598
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:17,090
I made several symposia 
chiropody,

599
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,950
everyone always enjoyed.

600
00:39:19,111 --> 00:39:22,247
We are with you, słodziaku! 
And now drink.

601
00:39:22,408 --> 00:39:24,216
Come on, to the bottom!

602
00:39:25,153 --> 00:39:26,934
It tastes flour ...

603
00:39:27,095 --> 00:39:31,528
Sweetheart! Before you one 
of the most important moments in life!

604
00:39:31,689 --> 00:39:33,216
See you, sweetie!

605
00:39:33,684 --> 00:39:35,294
- Honey, do not! 
- Let him have some fun.

606
00:39:35,455 --> 00:39:38,294
Have a drink, you need to chill.

607
00:39:40,325 --> 00:39:43,981
- Come on, come on ... 
- Strong, what is there?

608
00:39:44,142 --> 00:39:45,513
Vodka!

609
00:39:46,825 --> 00:39:49,653
- And a little bit of ecstasy. 
- Drugs ?!

610
00:39:49,814 --> 00:39:51,450
Hey, is anybody here?

611
00:39:52,283 --> 00:39:54,345
CAN YOU FEEL IT?

612
00:39:56,595 --> 00:39:58,189
Forgive me that I turned off the music,

613
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:01,533
but this one says 
that we can not have fun.

614
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:04,970
Well, come.

615
00:40:05,548 --> 00:40:06,752
Come.

616
00:40:07,064 --> 00:40:11,095
I thought so ... if 
you let it sit down behind the console.

617
00:40:11,595 --> 00:40:13,236
Why not...

618
00:40:13,705 --> 00:40:15,720
His name is Dr. F, F Filip!

619
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:17,595
CAN YOU FILIP!

620
00:40:19,627 --> 00:40:22,486
Do you want to say something?

621
00:40:22,783 --> 00:40:26,314
- Good night friends! 
- Ok, Dobra.

622
00:40:26,475 --> 00:40:28,923
Here you change the disc, here's a playlist ...

623
00:40:29,084 --> 00:40:33,189
There's no need to! 
I own playlist,

624
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:36,830
music lives in me, 
music is me!

625
00:40:36,991 --> 00:40:40,829
And only good music! 
Where can I put this?

626
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,095
Your ass.

627
00:40:42,256 --> 00:40:43,923
- Listen? 
- Come on, give it!

628
00:40:45,042 --> 00:40:47,850
And now a jiffy ...

629
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:52,038
Two minutes....

630
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:53,850
I snip!

631
00:41:00,663 --> 00:41:02,741
You're doing fine, podologu!

632
00:41:03,491 --> 00:41:07,157
All in all, a nice guy with you, 
seriously!

633
00:41:07,318 --> 00:41:10,553
Take łapsko because przetrącę them to you!

634
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,767
Anyway, caught!

635
00:41:14,928 --> 00:41:17,834
- Fire! 
- Shut the fuck up!

636
00:41:17,995 --> 00:41:19,600
Come on, nerwusku.

637
00:42:08,256 --> 00:42:09,491
Manon?

638
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,928
Well, now you've got a 18? 
Promising!

639
00:42:12,089 --> 00:42:14,022
Come on, it's important that they let me!

640
00:42:14,183 --> 00:42:15,897
- Where are they? 
- Over there!

641
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:20,839
Come on, Phil!

642
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:24,449
Honey, I fly!

643
00:42:26,495 --> 00:42:27,964
Latam!

644
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:29,808
Look!

645
00:42:29,969 --> 00:42:31,042
It's Mom!

646
00:42:33,495 --> 00:42:35,870
But how is it possible that you fly ?!

647
00:42:36,031 --> 00:42:38,714
I fly in the air, see!

648
00:42:38,875 --> 00:42:41,167
I'll go too soon!

649
00:42:47,074 --> 00:42:49,027
Carole, I fly!

650
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:58,057
- The triumph of Dr. F. 
- It clearly.

651
00:42:58,218 --> 00:43:04,136
Dr. F. nerwuskowi gave a lesson, 
thinned his minka!

652
00:43:06,511 --> 00:43:08,605
Philip, you will not be led!

653
00:43:08,766 --> 00:43:10,589
Well ... Come on!

654
00:43:12,683 --> 00:43:14,027
Filip!

655
00:43:15,464 --> 00:43:18,636
- Get in! 
- He got what he deserved!

656
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:21,542
Triumf Doktora F!

657
00:43:25,542 --> 00:43:27,511
Stop it already!

658
00:43:28,042 --> 00:43:29,995
Really you can do it lead?

659
00:43:30,156 --> 00:43:34,115
- Better me than Dr. F. 
- Dr. F, F Filip!

660
00:43:41,792 --> 00:43:43,214
Julien...

661
00:43:43,375 --> 00:43:45,917
Disable this muse, what a lame!

662
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:03,281
Kiss?

663
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:17,360
A Tara?

664
00:44:18,016 --> 00:44:19,610
I think it will forgive myself ...

665
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,125
Through it was a hospital, ecstasy ...

666
00:44:24,281 --> 00:44:28,625
- probably time to stop spoil our holiday ... 
- What are you, I'm playing great.

667
00:44:31,047 --> 00:44:33,781
I wonder if stoned Shrek also snoring ...

668
00:44:34,688 --> 00:44:37,578
Can you Filip!

669
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,891
It's not good.

670
00:44:45,047 --> 00:44:46,969
Come on, get outta here.

671
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,281
Slowly slowly...

672
00:45:06,297 --> 00:45:08,891
- What clumsy. 
- But he has moves!

673
00:45:09,052 --> 00:45:10,406
My egg!

674
00:45:11,969 --> 00:45:15,531
Honey, do not go it alone!

675
00:45:35,563 --> 00:45:40,203
I'm sorry about yesterday ... 
My mother was not herself.

676
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,735
- Philip also was not Philip. 
- No...

677
00:45:45,563 --> 00:45:48,016
But everything is under control,

678
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:52,985
- now we feel great! 
- So great.

679
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,750
Hello? Hello!

680
00:46:02,625 --> 00:46:06,344
- This SMS! 
- But with me Stupid!

681
00:46:08,203 --> 00:46:10,625
But Stupid! Excuse me...

682
00:46:15,844 --> 00:46:19,797
- Something's wrong? 
- Frankie invites us to the yacht.

683
00:46:20,047 --> 00:46:22,219
Children might have wanted to swim.

684
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:24,422
Wait a minute,

685
00:46:24,766 --> 00:46:28,875
as you want to have started doing drugs, 
I know a few guys here with the goods,

686
00:46:29,141 --> 00:46:33,344
- we do not need to push the sea. 
- Cool, and so we do not go anywhere!

687
00:46:33,505 --> 00:46:37,156
- I think you dream! 
- milutko, I will fix you cruise ...

688
00:46:37,317 --> 00:46:43,391
Honey, let the young to live their own way, 
do not force.

689
00:46:44,328 --> 00:46:48,985
- No problem, but I want the yacht. 
- Approx! Let's go, darling!

690
00:46:50,844 --> 00:46:52,797
There is parking.

691
00:46:54,938 --> 00:46:57,688
Let's go na drugi parking, darling!

692
00:46:59,344 --> 00:47:01,078
Have fun!

693
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:11,031
How do we hold out 
all day with Frank?

694
00:47:11,192 --> 00:47:14,750
After all, not bad ... 
I made him upset yesterday.

695
00:47:15,078 --> 00:47:18,515
So now I want to accept the 
friendly invitation to the boat.

696
00:47:18,676 --> 00:47:20,188
Sure thing!

697
00:47:20,349 --> 00:47:23,453
- You know, I'm not jealous. 
- Neither I!

698
00:47:23,614 --> 00:47:25,333
Envy compound poisons.

699
00:47:25,494 --> 00:47:28,458
And although this pacan Gilles betrayed me, 
I'm not going to change.

700
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:34,250
- Also better watch yourself. 
- I do not see the world outside of you!

701
00:47:34,411 --> 00:47:39,302
But stop talking now about the former, 
is unbearable.

702
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:44,224
- We are! 
- Relax, do not shout, he sees us.

703
00:47:44,385 --> 00:47:46,911
- Not to Spin! 
- humming in my head ...

704
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:49,036
Just chill!

705
00:47:51,036 --> 00:47:54,646
- But yesterday was fun! 
- What a night!

706
00:47:54,807 --> 00:47:56,958
I invite you!

707
00:47:59,192 --> 00:48:00,833
- All OK? 
- Yes.

708
00:48:02,692 --> 00:48:05,177
All OK?

709
00:48:05,338 --> 00:48:07,942
We feel great now ...

710
00:48:09,458 --> 00:48:10,911
Hello nice ladies ...

711
00:48:11,072 --> 00:48:12,302
- Phil. 
- Tess.

712
00:48:12,463 --> 00:48:13,567
Lubmila.

713
00:48:13,728 --> 00:48:16,817
Something beautiful! Where are you from?

714
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:19,588
- I am from Colombia. 
- And I'm from Puerto Rico.

715
00:48:19,838 --> 00:48:23,275
But the story of the first time I meet 
a real Latina.

716
00:48:23,436 --> 00:48:26,103
- It clutch for the button! 
- Well, it's full speed ahead!

717
00:48:26,749 --> 00:48:29,577
A catch! Because the first time.

718
00:48:30,749 --> 00:48:33,061
Well, goose! The direction of Formentera!

719
00:48:33,222 --> 00:48:35,905
How to say "sea wolf" 
after portorykańsku?

720
00:48:36,066 --> 00:48:38,155
Sailor, my love!

721
00:48:41,644 --> 00:48:43,191
You hold up, Grandpa?

722
00:48:45,238 --> 00:48:46,816
So...

723
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:49,316
But I overlaid a kidney ...

724
00:48:49,477 --> 00:48:50,977
- Do you want to turn back? 
- Wrong.

725
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,269
Maybe I'll make you a massage? 
My hands work wonders ...

726
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:56,660
- No need, I will deal with it! 
- Do not react so nervous ...

727
00:48:56,821 --> 00:49:00,957
It has smooth hands, wanted to help. 
And now I'm really hurt the kidneys.

728
00:49:02,488 --> 00:49:04,285
Hold on!

729
00:49:37,004 --> 00:49:39,035
Cool, Frank!

730
00:49:39,196 --> 00:49:41,597
Here we throw anchor?

731
00:49:42,227 --> 00:49:44,118
A big chunk from the shore, right?

732
00:49:44,279 --> 00:49:46,852
Sit and wait, soon will be the boat.

733
00:49:47,013 --> 00:49:50,477
Well, the boat. If you 
'd still swam.

734
00:49:50,638 --> 00:49:54,368
No problem! 
In any case, a nice trip!

735
00:49:56,868 --> 00:50:00,508
- You are the man for his age. 
- Thanks for kind words.

736
00:50:00,669 --> 00:50:03,930
Seriously, I wish my mom 
was such as you.

737
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,477
I did not even have wrinkles. 
You see? There is no wrinkles ...

738
00:50:06,638 --> 00:50:10,430
They say that time is celebrated 
with me leniently than others.

739
00:50:11,149 --> 00:50:12,602
I do not know.

740
00:50:12,899 --> 00:50:16,040
- He has the eye as laughs. 
- Okay, just ...

741
00:50:16,201 --> 00:50:20,196
So after a 40-ce poker face is, 
how you want to look good?

742
00:50:22,446 --> 00:50:24,290
Okay, then we off.

743
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:36,258
- What is it, honey? Boczysz up? 
- I have wrinkles, how to laugh?

744
00:50:36,419 --> 00:50:38,461
What? I have no idea. 
I did not notice.

745
00:50:38,622 --> 00:50:40,711
But you turned on the young ass!

746
00:50:40,872 --> 00:50:42,071
Oh no!

747
00:50:42,232 --> 00:50:44,368
Why bother with the old, 
as you have fresh meat here.

748
00:50:44,529 --> 00:50:46,336
Who do you take me for? 
I'm not your ex.

749
00:50:46,497 --> 00:50:48,816
I realized! 
He was a true seaman!

750
00:50:48,977 --> 00:50:52,672
Ah yes! How does not fit, 
I am buy a ticket and come back home!

751
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:55,899
Come back! You definitely have a direct 
connection Ibiza Crotu!

752
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:58,935
- CROTOY not CROTU! 
- Now, calm down.

753
00:50:59,638 --> 00:51:04,419
It's just a little tiff ... 
And I've got a cure!

754
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:06,294
For Madame pink wine,

755
00:51:06,455 --> 00:51:09,185
for you and 25 kg of lobster with my 
buddy Pascalou, what do you know?

756
00:51:09,346 --> 00:51:12,357
You'll see that it will help! 
And yet calm.

757
00:51:30,419 --> 00:51:31,497
Come on ...

758
00:51:31,658 --> 00:51:34,607
Like anything, you did not see 
me with his wife.

759
00:51:34,768 --> 00:51:37,279
Because it happens that sometimes 
a little jealous ...

760
00:51:37,482 --> 00:51:40,076
Hey Pascalou, Catouche, 
brought to you guests!

761
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,997
Did you bring guests so? 
And I'll just press down!

762
00:51:43,158 --> 00:51:44,919
- Padding you fuck, you know? 
- But for what?

763
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:48,247
- For what?! You know what! 
- For what?!

764
00:51:50,279 --> 00:51:54,247
Throughout the week there did you come 
to visit me!

765
00:51:54,417 --> 00:51:57,763
Not eggs, not too ... 
I brought you a visitor.

766
00:51:57,924 --> 00:51:59,872
- Good morning! 
- Good morning.

767
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:02,294
Catouche? You do not say hello?

768
00:52:05,044 --> 00:52:06,279
Hey, Frankie.

769
00:52:07,529 --> 00:52:10,310
- And what of this? 
- How's your lobster?

770
00:52:10,471 --> 00:52:12,341
Homary? 
Joseph!

771
00:52:12,502 --> 00:52:14,638
- Show lobsters! 
- Did you see? Magnifico!

772
00:52:16,792 --> 00:52:22,075
And I advise you to eat clean, 
if you want to get out of inches!

773
00:52:23,294 --> 00:52:25,732
Before us a real treat, what a day!

774
00:52:31,497 --> 00:52:33,029
You can not take it anymore, huh?

775
00:52:33,654 --> 00:52:36,701
You have to keep a distance. 
For me it does not work anymore.

776
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:40,013
This is my everyday life ... of 
what, Frankie, since when?

777
00:52:40,174 --> 00:52:41,794
You do not count.

778
00:52:42,185 --> 00:52:45,107
Brunette, blonde, 
small ass, big tits ...

779
00:52:45,716 --> 00:52:48,341
Even they do not even notice!

780
00:52:48,792 --> 00:52:53,167
But if I wanted to, przeleciałbym 
everything that moves here.

781
00:52:53,328 --> 00:52:56,060
- Undoubtedly. 
- But is not love.

782
00:52:57,482 --> 00:52:59,732
If you love a woman, 
is it respect, Philip.

783
00:53:01,669 --> 00:53:04,107
- Of course ... 
- Catouche!

784
00:53:04,435 --> 00:53:07,341
- How long are we together? 
- 15 years, baby.

785
00:53:07,502 --> 00:53:10,419
15 wiosenek, no jumping to the side, 
without a cloud in our sky!

786
00:53:10,488 --> 00:53:13,810
And so it should be at home! 
This is. And you, Frankie?

787
00:53:13,971 --> 00:53:17,122
When they finally get married? 
Do you want to be alone like this ...

788
00:53:17,283 --> 00:53:18,685
Just...

789
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:22,451
Unfortunately, I have not found 
your Catouche ...

790
00:53:22,613 --> 00:53:26,201
- I'd rather not find ... 
- What's she so undermined?

791
00:53:26,363 --> 00:53:29,820
You better give us another bottle, 
because sober you can not hear this.

792
00:53:29,982 --> 00:53:33,154
It was a real treat, 
immediately unless they burst!

793
00:53:33,315 --> 00:53:34,919
Philip likes to eat!

794
00:53:36,107 --> 00:53:39,247
As soon as you throw in two lobsters. 
Giuseppe 2 lobsters for Philip!

795
00:53:39,408 --> 00:53:42,513
- Oh no, no ... 
- Philip, are on the house.

796
00:53:42,674 --> 00:53:44,435
No longer fit, anything!

797
00:53:44,997 --> 00:53:47,013
And Mrs. nothing is not, Diet?

798
00:53:47,174 --> 00:53:51,934
I need a drink before I show up 
with the dupskiem on the dance floor!

799
00:53:52,982 --> 00:53:54,513
But gull, huh?

800
00:54:12,404 --> 00:54:15,201
- Hi. 
- Hi.

801
00:54:15,363 --> 00:54:19,529
- It's not you I saw yesterday? 
- Yesterday? Yes ... That was me.

802
00:54:20,122 --> 00:54:23,154
- OK, to cool.
- No, cool.

803
00:54:25,872 --> 00:54:29,154
- Do not you ask my name? 
- Sure ... What's your name?

804
00:54:29,315 --> 00:54:30,451
Justine.

805
00:54:30,613 --> 00:54:33,435
- Approx. Julien. 
- I did not ask you about the name.

806
00:54:35,654 --> 00:54:37,294
I'm kidding.

807
00:54:37,669 --> 00:54:40,341
Justine Julien, that's so sweet!

808
00:54:41,872 --> 00:54:44,138
Champagne for my friends!

809
00:54:44,299 --> 00:54:48,294
- You are now one of them, Philip. 
- I feel honored.

810
00:54:50,029 --> 00:54:51,747
I recognize this girl,

811
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:53,607
I recognize her!

812
00:54:54,091 --> 00:54:55,466
Impossible!

813
00:54:55,982 --> 00:54:58,149
And this where? You can not leave 
just like lobsters?

814
00:54:58,283 --> 00:55:00,654
These are not the cheap stuff! 
Your buddy is an ordinary boor!

815
00:55:00,815 --> 00:55:02,872
- He is not one ... 
- What do you mean?

816
00:55:03,435 --> 00:55:05,435
Catouche what you gotten into?

817
00:55:05,596 --> 00:55:07,763
- What did you do? 
- Wait wait....

818
00:55:07,924 --> 00:55:10,430
I know why so stroszy me. 
The point is that I brought this guy ...

819
00:55:10,455 --> 00:55:11,622
This type of hunter.

820
00:55:11,919 --> 00:55:15,809
Hunters? Are you crazy? 
It does not look like this ...

821
00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:18,669
I learned that he tried 
to grope club Catouche ...

822
00:55:19,091 --> 00:55:21,482
And so now I look like, 
it must be true!

823
00:55:23,638 --> 00:55:25,154
Cholera!

824
00:55:31,201 --> 00:55:32,341
Well...

825
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:36,013
You stop getting angry?

826
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:37,794
Go have fun with their whores!

827
00:55:37,955 --> 00:55:40,055
Come on, they have 20 years! 
You know, I prefer real women!

828
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,544
Stop bother me ... 
Tell me you love me!

829
00:55:42,705 --> 00:55:43,966
No more ...

830
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:47,518
You can not say it! 
Immediately everything outspoken Pascalou!

831
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:49,674
I have these lies fed up!

832
00:55:49,835 --> 00:55:51,143
The young lady Tara?

833
00:55:52,252 --> 00:55:53,502
Tara?

834
00:55:54,815 --> 00:55:59,674
Sorry, do not be afraid. 
I am, let's say ... stepfather ...

835
00:55:59,893 --> 00:56:03,502
Julien Lemerche, you went with him 
to school in Lille.

836
00:56:03,663 --> 00:56:06,252
I remember ... It is clear to Ibiza?

837
00:56:06,413 --> 00:56:10,158
Yes! I wanted to speak to you, 
but apparently did not have a cell phone?

838
00:56:10,363 --> 00:56:13,455
- Parents are antyfalowcami! 
- Oh, yes, great ...

839
00:56:13,627 --> 00:56:15,674
A stationary?

840
00:56:16,268 --> 00:56:18,767
We are, but rarely someone answers it.

841
00:56:18,928 --> 00:56:22,815
It was me I would have enrolled, 
Julien will gladly call.

842
00:56:23,096 --> 00:56:24,988
Sure, 0034 ...

843
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:28,143
Wait a minute, however, the case acts, 
as promised ...

844
00:56:28,304 --> 00:56:31,565
0034 ... Wait a minute, I erased ...

845
00:56:31,726 --> 00:56:35,002
But clumsy of me, already, 0034 ...

846
00:56:35,163 --> 00:56:36,627
Hey, buddy!

847
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:41,018
You wanted to fuck my wife?

848
00:56:41,179 --> 00:56:43,018
- shake the fuck you! 
- He's crazy!

849
00:56:43,179 --> 00:56:44,565
You shake the fuck up!

850
00:56:47,583 --> 00:56:49,705
Help! Help!

851
00:56:51,125 --> 00:56:53,208
It's a maniac!

852
00:56:53,627 --> 00:56:56,877
What's happening?! 
Pascalou, what are you doing?

853
00:56:57,143 --> 00:56:59,226
- Stop it! Let him go! 
- It is true that you groped?

854
00:56:59,304 --> 00:57:01,846
- Who told you that? 
- Who told me?

855
00:57:02,625 --> 00:57:04,033
Frankie!

856
00:57:04,194 --> 00:57:06,860
All that I told you, I told 
only that something was on top of things ...

857
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,080
It's not him...

858
00:57:08,241 --> 00:57:10,783
It's a thick Belgian, 
wanted to catch me in the toilet ....

859
00:57:10,944 --> 00:57:11,985
Thick Belgian?

860
00:57:12,101 --> 00:57:13,863
How to find him now ?!

861
00:57:14,024 --> 00:57:17,035
Already I'll show him! 
Where is that son of a bitch ?!

862
00:57:17,196 --> 00:57:20,098
- I'll handle it tonight! 
- Calm down.

863
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:21,957
I'm calm.

864
00:57:22,644 --> 00:57:25,102
Thank you, Frankie. Well, 
that although I can count on you!

865
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:26,582
Move up.

866
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:27,915
Maniac!

867
00:57:28,227 --> 00:57:30,946
- But I got ... 
- We go back, I've had enough!

868
00:57:31,852 --> 00:57:33,274
Do not take you back?

869
00:57:33,435 --> 00:57:35,524
Oh no! I'd rather have more 
will not see you!

870
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:38,477
Stay with a buddy and his wife, 
unless you have to comfort her.

871
00:57:38,638 --> 00:57:39,946
Definitely!

872
00:57:40,149 --> 00:57:41,634
He got me.

873
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:49,618
- What we do? 
- I'm looking at you right Insta.

874
00:57:49,779 --> 00:57:53,836
- I'm here with you, what to look for me? 
- But you know, later on.

875
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:56,696
Ah yes? 
On the what?

876
00:57:56,857 --> 00:57:58,993
There you are! @ Justine25, right?

877
00:57:59,884 --> 00:58:01,696
Wow, how many you have followersów ...

878
00:58:02,649 --> 00:58:06,982
- Okay, I go out, right here melt. 
- Wait, I turn aircon.

879
00:58:07,917 --> 00:58:10,750
- Leave. 
It's perfect!

880
00:58:36,759 --> 00:58:38,852
Plus it is that Tara found.

881
00:58:39,013 --> 00:58:43,196
And minus the one that I think I have 
Guillain-Barre syndrome ...

882
00:58:43,357 --> 00:58:44,430
What is this?

883
00:58:44,591 --> 00:58:47,540
I have no feeling, 
slap me numb ...

884
00:58:47,701 --> 00:58:50,384
It's probably acute ...

885
00:58:54,555 --> 00:58:58,071
Although, though ... 
again, for sure ...

886
00:58:58,232 --> 00:58:59,774
It is not bad,

887
00:58:59,935 --> 00:59:03,696
I feel a slight tingling sensation, 
I'm saved ...

888
00:59:05,588 --> 00:59:08,977
- That's better, you smile. 
- What you do make me laugh.

889
00:59:09,274 --> 00:59:12,165
Anyway ... 
to me they do not interfere.

890
00:59:12,477 --> 00:59:13,571
Co?

891
00:59:13,732 --> 00:59:14,838
Your wrinkles,

892
00:59:14,998 --> 00:59:18,493
you laughing ... When the left eye 
and the right too.

893
00:59:18,654 --> 00:59:21,227
- That's less ridiculous. 
- But it looks lovely.

894
00:59:33,384 --> 00:59:36,088
I think the time has come, 
we say to you ...

895
00:59:36,248 --> 00:59:37,930
Philip has won a number of Tara.

896
00:59:38,091 --> 00:59:42,591
Stationary. There is no cell, because her 
parents are antyfalowcami.

897
00:59:43,201 --> 00:59:45,654
- What, no reaction? 
- What, me hanging.

898
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:48,273
- Julien! Do not talk to Philip! 
- Easy, Carole ...

899
00:59:48,434 --> 00:59:50,920
How quietly? As many have done, 
to find her,

900
00:59:51,081 --> 00:59:52,232
and he so thank you for that?

901
00:59:52,393 --> 00:59:56,154
What do you have to Philip? It is too old, 
is an idiot, is embarrassing?

902
00:59:56,315 --> 00:59:58,935
- And something else? 
- Carole, after all, so they did not say.

903
00:59:59,096 --> 01:00:01,185
They said! 
And if not, it definitely thought!

904
01:00:01,346 --> 01:00:04,248
Enough lies, now we are talking 
ourselves but the truth ...

905
01:00:04,409 --> 01:00:07,998
Do you want the truth? Tara I do not care, 
I met a great girl here!

906
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:10,201
Except that the pig someone already has ...

907
01:00:11,091 --> 01:00:13,091
- Julien! 
- Give me a break!

908
01:00:16,482 --> 01:00:20,170
If we say anything now, 
I also met a super guy and ...

909
01:00:20,331 --> 01:00:23,763
- That punk from the pool? 
- It's not punk, it's a hipster!

910
01:00:23,924 --> 01:00:26,420
Manon, come on! What did you do with him?

911
01:00:27,435 --> 01:00:29,513
Mom, but certainly not to piss off?

912
01:00:31,982 --> 01:00:33,685
It was even nice.

913
01:00:35,091 --> 01:00:37,029
Although still a little hurt ...

914
01:00:37,263 --> 01:00:40,076
Manon, you have 13 years, what are you talking about?

915
01:00:41,951 --> 01:00:43,388
About my tattoo ...

916
01:00:46,185 --> 01:00:48,873
Aaah! That's wonderful, darling! 
As well, that did it myself!

917
01:00:49,034 --> 01:00:51,685
- We're going after Julien? 
- Sure, Julien!

918
01:00:51,846 --> 01:00:55,888
Tattoo is a great thing ... 
Outstanding ...

919
01:00:56,154 --> 01:00:59,029
- Even though you have not seen it ... 
- That's okay, it is beautiful ...

920
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:00,998
It is certainly nice, 
you have great taste!

921
01:01:01,159 --> 01:01:02,201
Cholera!

922
01:01:03,841 --> 01:01:05,607
He could not have gone far!

923
01:01:05,768 --> 01:01:08,170
- He's not answering ... 
- Why do not you call?

924
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,920
- He's not answering ... 
- That's unlike him.

925
01:01:11,081 --> 01:01:12,638
Relax, think ...

926
01:01:13,201 --> 01:01:17,545
We are the fortress of Charles V in 
the sixteenth century ...

927
01:01:17,706 --> 01:01:18,920
We are now somewhere.

928
01:01:19,081 --> 01:01:21,259
I do not understand you. The point is 
that it was built on the set of wheels!

929
01:01:21,284 --> 01:01:23,404
So if you go this way, 
and that way I ...

930
01:01:23,565 --> 01:01:25,576
- Take longer forgive! 
- I have to let go ?!

931
01:01:25,738 --> 01:01:28,404
Charles V prided himself on this project.

932
01:01:28,565 --> 01:01:30,873
Thanks to him the city was 
impregnable!

933
01:01:31,513 --> 01:01:33,716
Nobody wants to listen to me ...

934
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:53,451
Julien?

935
01:01:54,357 --> 01:01:55,591
Julien!

936
01:02:00,826 --> 01:02:04,607
Look, I know I'm not your father, 
or even your bro.

937
01:02:04,768 --> 01:02:07,857
- What? 
- Come on, bro, buddy ...

938
01:02:08,748 --> 01:02:10,623
But I'll tell you something.

939
01:02:11,232 --> 01:02:13,529
Something personal 
about me and my life.

940
01:02:15,576 --> 01:02:17,170
It never went to women.

941
01:02:17,331 --> 01:02:20,373
His first wife left me, 
I hated her for it.

942
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:22,295
But now I think she was right.

943
01:02:22,456 --> 01:02:25,732
If she was with me satisfied, 
it would not do that ...

944
01:02:25,893 --> 01:02:27,560
And now I'm shaking breeches,

945
01:02:28,513 --> 01:02:30,841
your mom will do the same.

946
01:02:31,404 --> 01:02:34,341
Do not leave you, what have you! 
It is totally zabujana you ...

947
01:02:35,826 --> 01:02:37,404
Thanks, but ...

948
01:02:37,810 --> 01:02:40,607
it's not so simple! 
My parents, scrabble,

949
01:02:40,768 --> 01:02:43,529
dentures and all the rest ... 
It's complicated.

950
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:48,779
And I'm not ready for you advice, 
but today on Formentera

951
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:53,341
I met Tara, a beautiful girl!

952
01:02:53,502 --> 01:02:56,920
And when I said that you are looking for her, 
in her eyes she lit a spark.

953
01:02:57,236 --> 01:02:59,558
You passed the high school diploma, you came here 
to meet her.

954
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:01,005
We have her number ...

955
01:03:01,409 --> 01:03:02,956
Perhaps now a shame to forgive?

956
01:03:03,117 --> 01:03:06,596
A winning number was not easy! 
He beat me one asshole ...

957
01:03:06,846 --> 01:03:08,424
He attacked me for no reason.

958
01:03:08,585 --> 01:03:11,951
I barely escaped with his life, 
the poor man, because frankly ...

959
01:03:12,113 --> 01:03:15,738
I do not abhor aggression, 
it would have wiped him to a pulp!

960
01:03:15,898 --> 01:03:17,581
Here, you call.

961
01:03:18,518 --> 01:03:21,518
It's the number that begins with 34, 
I'll wait.

962
01:03:22,659 --> 01:03:25,018
I'll have to look, 
because I certainly worried.

963
01:03:49,333 --> 01:03:51,508
Why not add a gas? 
We left the city.

964
01:03:51,669 --> 01:03:53,550
Finally someone said it out loud, 
it's not unbearable.

965
01:03:53,575 --> 01:03:56,227
I do not know what it was, 
from the beginning do not want to accelerate.

966
01:03:56,388 --> 01:03:58,971
This speed limiter to 50 km / h. 
Try now!

967
01:03:59,132 --> 01:04:00,555
We have it! Thanks Julien!

968
01:04:00,716 --> 01:04:03,477
But you can kick-start 
this chaise ...

969
01:04:04,492 --> 01:04:06,070
Not bad.

970
01:04:06,231 --> 01:04:07,664
And beware!

971
01:04:09,071 --> 01:04:10,430
Carefully, carefully!

972
01:04:30,305 --> 01:04:34,664
Who wants to know the remarkable history of 
the church of the holy Gertrude?

973
01:04:34,825 --> 01:04:37,133
- No one! 
- Too bad ...

974
01:04:53,669 --> 01:04:54,710
Good day.

975
01:04:54,846 --> 01:04:56,372
- Good morning .... 
- Julien.

976
01:04:59,982 --> 01:05:01,528
It's your parents?

977
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:02,778
Yes, but they are on their way.

978
01:05:02,939 --> 01:05:04,622
- And yes, of course. 
- Ideal,

979
01:05:05,435 --> 01:05:07,060
and what's your name?

980
01:05:07,221 --> 01:05:11,825
- Julien. Welcome to us! 
- We will not disturb?

981
01:05:11,986 --> 01:05:13,810
Not at all!

982
01:05:13,971 --> 01:05:16,653
It's always nice to be with people ....

983
01:05:16,888 --> 01:05:18,560
Philip, I am pleased.

984
01:05:18,721 --> 01:05:21,669
- Julien. 
- Carole and Manon's sister Ju ...

985
01:05:21,830 --> 01:05:25,466
Adorable little girl! 
The skin removed from my dad!

986
01:05:25,857 --> 01:05:29,513
- I'm not her father ... 
- Really! Those same eyes!

987
01:05:29,841 --> 01:05:31,747
Come on, we'll have something ...

988
01:05:31,908 --> 01:05:33,935
Come on, nothing to it arrives.

989
01:05:36,471 --> 01:05:40,361
Welcome to our humble abode. 
Sorry for the mess...

990
01:05:41,236 --> 01:05:43,580
I introduce to you, Michel, 
just floats.

991
01:05:44,643 --> 01:05:47,564
Pysiu! We have visitors.

992
01:05:47,814 --> 01:05:48,924
I'm coming.

993
01:05:49,518 --> 01:05:52,924
- That's how you got your name? 
- Philip.

994
01:05:53,085 --> 01:05:55,486
- I told you. 
- It's hard to overlook.

995
01:05:57,486 --> 01:05:59,877
There is something else that hard to overlook.

996
01:06:00,814 --> 01:06:02,096
Truth...

997
01:06:02,257 --> 01:06:04,658
I'm sorry, I swim every 2.5 hours.

998
01:06:04,819 --> 01:06:07,564
Caring for the heart above all.

999
01:06:07,725 --> 01:06:10,205
I am a cardiologist, 
so I know what I'm talking about.

1000
01:06:10,674 --> 01:06:13,132
- I am pleased, Michel. 
- Philip.

1001
01:06:13,293 --> 01:06:15,658
We kind of a marching ...

1002
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:19,705
- I'm Podiatry. 
- Well, you had to learn.

1003
01:06:19,866 --> 01:06:22,283
Sure you had with 
a good laugh at the university.

1004
01:06:22,444 --> 01:06:25,627
We used to say that the feet 
are stinking specialization.

1005
01:06:27,893 --> 01:06:30,377
- actually funny. 
- Justin

1006
01:06:30,538 --> 01:06:34,189
- Tara is waiting in the gazebo. Go to her. 
- Go on, Justin.

1007
01:06:35,955 --> 01:06:39,330
- Beyond the trees and straight. 
- Thank you.

1008
01:06:39,830 --> 01:06:41,971
And is Maella.

1009
01:06:43,268 --> 01:06:46,158
- Do not say hello, darling? 
- Good morning, Maëlle ...

1010
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:48,127
- Good morning, Maëlle ... 
- Beautiful, huh?

1011
01:06:48,288 --> 01:06:49,329
Lovely.

1012
01:06:49,444 --> 01:06:53,689
- So it is with young people like to be ... 
- I just have time.

1013
01:06:58,549 --> 01:07:01,471
How do you manage to be 
so green garden?

1014
01:07:01,632 --> 01:07:04,783
- Watering must cost a fortune? 
- Not a penny!

1015
01:07:04,944 --> 01:07:08,158
The biggest challenge for humanity 
today is the treatment of waste.

1016
01:07:08,330 --> 01:07:11,408
- And with us is the whole recycling. 
- Yes!

1017
01:07:11,689 --> 01:07:14,408
- It's great. 
- We are 100% Organic!

1018
01:07:16,314 --> 01:07:20,080
- We go to? 
- With pleasure.

1019
01:07:32,971 --> 01:07:35,345
- Tara? 
- I'm here.

1020
01:07:36,830 --> 01:07:39,377
You take a shower in his clothes?

1021
01:07:39,814 --> 01:07:40,955
No...

1022
01:07:42,049 --> 01:07:44,689
I like to feel on the skin cold flax ...

1023
01:07:46,705 --> 01:07:48,408
You also want to be refreshing?

1024
01:07:50,424 --> 01:07:51,877
Sure, why not.

1025
01:07:52,830 --> 01:07:54,049
Come then.

1026
01:08:13,783 --> 01:08:16,564
You take a shower in his clothes?

1027
01:08:16,830 --> 01:08:21,174
Yes, I feel on the skin 
wet cotton.

1028
01:08:21,377 --> 01:08:23,596
I wonder if your phone too.

1029
01:08:25,377 --> 01:08:26,705
Oh shit ...

1030
01:08:26,866 --> 01:08:30,549
Choose an area for nawiezienia 
and fertilizer is directed there.

1031
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:34,299
- Oh, I see. 
- Please! The reservoir is filled.

1032
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:35,611
He is filled?

1033
01:08:35,772 --> 01:08:39,799
All waste, water, gray 
water, black ... like a ship,

1034
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:43,627
We grind it and make this 
100% natural fertilizer ....

1035
01:08:43,788 --> 01:08:47,439
- I circle closes. 
- There are four of us, it goes fast ...

1036
01:08:48,299 --> 01:08:50,548
- Ah yes? 
- Come to taste.

1037
01:08:50,721 --> 01:08:54,064
- With pleasure ... 
- What do you mean "all waste"?

1038
01:08:54,225 --> 01:08:55,361
What do you think?

1039
01:08:55,522 --> 01:08:59,377
- It's disgusting. 
- I prefer there not to eat anything.

1040
01:08:59,538 --> 01:09:01,643
You watch Walking Dead?

1041
01:09:02,830 --> 01:09:06,377
Typical American series, 
which draws from the 15th of the season ...

1042
01:09:06,538 --> 01:09:10,049
- I pulled out of the second. 
- It was a metaphor.

1043
01:09:10,377 --> 01:09:12,680
If I say that you hit 
the ball in the fence, it does not mean

1044
01:09:12,705 --> 01:09:14,361
that there is a ball and a fence.

1045
01:09:17,189 --> 01:09:19,642
- Fertilization all the vegetables. 
- That's fertilizer ...

1046
01:09:19,803 --> 01:09:21,314
Natural fertilizer.

1047
01:09:22,017 --> 01:09:25,439
You will not find these in France, 
a round as a baby's bottom!

1048
01:09:25,908 --> 01:09:28,845
- And how it smells! 
- How a baby's bottom ...

1049
01:09:29,006 --> 01:09:31,111
Maybe even you would have to scroll through it!

1050
01:09:34,642 --> 01:09:36,001
It's meant to be funny?

1051
01:09:37,126 --> 01:09:40,361
No, we often walk alone ...

1052
01:09:40,522 --> 01:09:43,298
We have a great central square in Lille bio.

1053
01:09:43,459 --> 01:09:46,673
Yes, Wazemmes ... 
has always been boycotting it.

1054
01:09:46,939 --> 01:09:49,658
Pseudo ciapatych of bio ...

1055
01:09:51,298 --> 01:09:55,345
Yes! I had two days 
of diarrhea after those strawberries!

1056
01:09:56,033 --> 01:09:57,658
Ryneczek Wazemmes!

1057
01:09:58,330 --> 01:09:59,798
Honey, what happened?

1058
01:10:01,517 --> 01:10:05,205
- They are well szurnięci ... 
- Oh yes!

1059
01:10:06,361 --> 01:10:07,783
Do you have any tattoos?

1060
01:10:11,314 --> 01:10:13,486
I just did myself, it is great.

1061
01:10:13,647 --> 01:10:16,001
Mom probably will not be thrilled.

1062
01:10:16,866 --> 01:10:19,772
- You want to see? 
- No need, I've got it somewhere.

1063
01:10:20,366 --> 01:10:22,819
Listen, baby, you can give me 
joint from the table?

1064
01:10:24,709 --> 01:10:28,663
And recently I was at a concert 
Nekfeu with Zenit was mega!

1065
01:10:29,319 --> 01:10:31,553
This annoys me terribly lad,

1066
01:10:31,897 --> 01:10:33,209
I can not look at him ...

1067
01:10:33,370 --> 01:10:35,022
And there is something you like? 
In addition to its own Japa?

1068
01:10:35,183 --> 01:10:36,600
What?! How can you say that?

1069
01:10:36,761 --> 01:10:39,366
Everything I say is shit. 
But maybe you're the shit?

1070
01:10:39,391 --> 01:10:41,339
You're crazy! Go cure yourself!

1071
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:44,542
What am I doing here anyway? And yet 
I spoiled by you phone!

1072
01:10:44,703 --> 01:10:47,563
- Okay, get outta here! 
- You and your family is sick!

1073
01:10:50,172 --> 01:10:52,078
All in all, it's gone I feel like.

1074
01:10:53,188 --> 01:10:55,641
- Are you kidding me? 
- Calm down, baby, what's up?

1075
01:10:55,802 --> 01:10:57,188
Manon, what are you doing here?

1076
01:10:57,438 --> 01:10:59,578
- Did you give her a joint? 
- I did not give, you fool ...

1077
01:10:59,739 --> 01:11:02,359
- Manon gave you smoke? 
- Yes.

1078
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:05,703
- But it gets dark ... 
- And what, you hit me?

1079
01:11:05,864 --> 01:11:07,801
No, but I'll do it ...

1080
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:09,770
What are you doing?! 
Who do you have?

1081
01:11:09,931 --> 01:11:12,161
Dad! He twisted my neck! Dad!

1082
01:11:12,322 --> 01:11:14,739
- What did you do to my daughter? 
- joint gave my sister!

1083
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:18,552
Oh no! Now, please, come on!

1084
01:11:19,255 --> 01:11:20,567
And what is it?

1085
01:11:20,728 --> 01:11:22,728
Julien, violence is never 
anything not do the trick!

1086
01:11:22,889 --> 01:11:26,005
Sure, just do not scrap a lick. 
Stupid, smelly podolog!

1087
01:11:26,166 --> 01:11:27,911
Mug, small fiutku!

1088
01:11:28,849 --> 01:11:30,182
A blond man what he wants?

1089
01:11:30,583 --> 01:11:32,958
What's she doing? Not that!

1090
01:11:33,661 --> 01:11:35,302
Well done, darling! Bravo!

1091
01:11:36,614 --> 01:11:38,692
My irrigation system!

1092
01:11:38,853 --> 01:11:40,239
Who wants the prickly pear fig?

1093
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,631
You know where you can shove 
these their prickly pears ?!

1094
01:11:42,792 --> 01:11:44,333
Nobody wants!

1095
01:11:50,433 --> 01:11:52,698
Spoiled the whole system!

1096
01:11:52,917 --> 01:11:54,245
PYSIO?

1097
01:11:55,761 --> 01:11:57,558
- What was that? 
- Gównotrysk!

1098
01:11:57,719 --> 01:11:59,230
100% bio!

1099
01:12:00,198 --> 01:12:02,865
They are everywhere!

1100
01:12:03,683 --> 01:12:05,073
Immediately grabbed them!

1101
01:12:05,776 --> 01:12:08,901
War! Shocker!

1102
01:12:09,683 --> 01:12:11,526
They are everywhere, everywhere!

1103
01:12:13,198 --> 01:12:14,636
Dupki!

1104
01:12:19,839 --> 01:12:21,042
Idiots!

1105
01:12:21,542 --> 01:12:25,084
Auto open, keys inside! 
Fast!

1106
01:12:25,245 --> 01:12:27,011
- Wait! 
- Mom, come on ...

1107
01:12:27,172 --> 01:12:30,198
- Come on, Mom! 
- wash up, assholes!

1108
01:12:31,433 --> 01:12:33,401
Let them grabbed!

1109
01:12:49,901 --> 01:12:51,651
We came out of this with dry feet!

1110
01:12:51,813 --> 01:12:53,995
But their załatwiłaś, Mom! 
Championship!

1111
01:12:54,156 --> 01:12:55,448
Well done, darling, bravo!

1112
01:12:55,609 --> 01:12:58,105
Well, that you were with us! 
Because you wymiękłeś again!

1113
01:12:58,266 --> 01:13:00,558
- crazy? 
- Come on, we ourselves speak the truth!

1114
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:03,683
Dad gave to him in the throat 
and it would be the case ...

1115
01:13:03,844 --> 01:13:05,261
Manon, silence!

1116
01:13:05,422 --> 01:13:06,464
Sure.

1117
01:13:08,964 --> 01:13:11,136
Thank you and good night!

1118
01:13:13,698 --> 01:13:15,042
Sweetheart!

1119
01:13:35,683 --> 01:13:38,683
Philip, do not take it personally, 
did not want to say so.

1120
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:41,917
Give me a break.

1121
01:13:45,245 --> 01:13:48,605
I'm sorry, Philip ... 
do not think so!

1122
01:13:49,136 --> 01:13:53,433
I know very well what you're thinking! 
From the beginning! End of it.

1123
01:13:53,594 --> 01:13:55,448
I'm an old, stupid, weird ...

1124
01:13:55,609 --> 01:13:57,943
I can never become part of 
your family! And that's it!

1125
01:13:58,031 --> 01:14:00,261
- so cool! 
- Thanks for support...

1126
01:14:00,422 --> 01:14:02,230
See for yourself! Do you see the sign?

1127
01:14:02,391 --> 01:14:05,339
El Rayo Verde, told us about it, 
there really ...

1128
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:07,803
It turns out, however, that I am not 
such a fool finite ...

1129
01:14:07,828 --> 01:14:09,073
Come on, let's go.

1130
01:14:09,948 --> 01:14:12,323
- Come on, Philip! 
- Go alone, I'll stay here.

1131
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:15,578
No way, he told 
us about this place!

1132
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:18,365
- Come on, please ... 
- Do not be mad anymore!

1133
01:14:19,688 --> 01:14:22,344
Come! Without your story 
will not be the same.

1134
01:14:22,906 --> 01:14:25,266
If you ask, I'll go.

1135
01:14:28,641 --> 01:14:33,563
You'll see a real, 
wild, untamed Ibiza,

1136
01:14:33,917 --> 01:14:36,250
the islanders come here just ...

1137
01:14:36,422 --> 01:14:38,938
Julien, you will make beautiful pictures!

1138
01:14:39,969 --> 01:14:42,875
Indeed, wild Ibiza.

1139
01:14:43,036 --> 01:14:45,813
Maybe even too much, huh?

1140
01:14:45,974 --> 01:14:47,563
It's not good.

1141
01:14:47,802 --> 01:14:51,317
- That's what we like, darling. 
- Come on lemonade.

1142
01:14:53,667 --> 01:14:56,833
Manon, do not look up!

1143
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:01,411
Did you see? All the goals!

1144
01:15:01,572 --> 01:15:06,106
It's hard not to notice!

1145
01:15:10,434 --> 01:15:13,273
And I believed in the fairy tale 
of the green radius of the sun ...

1146
01:15:20,888 --> 01:15:23,091
Oh no! I missed!

1147
01:15:24,388 --> 01:15:26,356
- Damn! 
- Oh no!

1148
01:15:28,544 --> 01:15:29,841
We missed!

1149
01:15:30,002 --> 01:15:32,751
I have not seen anything! 
Eternal gapa ...

1150
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,583
In any case, thank you 
for the holidays, Julien ...

1151
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:39,083
I played great, 
it's your merit!

1152
01:15:39,251 --> 01:15:40,506
Thank you too...

1153
01:15:40,667 --> 01:15:42,958
It's not over yet, 
we still have tomorrow.

1154
01:15:43,119 --> 01:15:45,299
That, about which we have a plane?

1155
01:15:45,494 --> 01:15:47,526
I have saved it somewhere ...

1156
01:15:48,104 --> 01:15:50,104
It makes no sense, no?

1157
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:53,510
Saturday, 0:10 hour.

1158
01:15:54,494 --> 01:15:57,463
That means Sunday 0:10?

1159
01:15:57,624 --> 01:15:59,588
... not tomorrow, Saturday, 
ten minutes after midnight.

1160
01:15:59,749 --> 01:16:03,776
- In front of us the whole day to relax. 
- Honey, wait a minute.

1161
01:16:03,938 --> 01:16:07,526
Sunday 0:10 time 
is the beginning of Sunday.

1162
01:16:07,713 --> 01:16:09,166
Not Saturday ...

1163
01:16:09,588 --> 01:16:12,380
If you want, fly on Sunday. 
But we have tickets ...

1164
01:16:12,541 --> 01:16:14,916
Saturday at 0:10 for an hour!

1165
01:16:15,077 --> 01:16:19,213
Mom, it's Friday night ... 
So at 0:10 on Saturday will be soon!

1166
01:16:19,374 --> 01:16:21,354
Philip is right!

1167
01:16:21,874 --> 01:16:23,421
But me an idiot!

1168
01:16:23,582 --> 01:16:24,811
No idiot!

1169
01:16:25,292 --> 01:16:26,749
Wait ...

1170
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:33,063
With a little organization we can do it. 
We will not, we will not ...

1171
01:16:34,515 --> 01:16:37,181
Wait, I stumble over a dress!

Broke my phone ... 
Anyway, you were probably busy with it here.
