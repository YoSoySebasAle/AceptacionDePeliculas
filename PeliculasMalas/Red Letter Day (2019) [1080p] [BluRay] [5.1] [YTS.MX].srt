1
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:40,555
No, wait, wait.

2
00:03:45,455 --> 00:03:49,390
What do you
want in a neighborhood?

3
00:03:49,392 --> 00:03:51,926
What do you want in a home?

4
00:03:51,928 --> 00:03:55,730
At Harrison Homes, we build
beautiful award-winning homes

5
00:03:55,732 --> 00:03:59,367
and develop dynamic
new communities.

6
00:03:59,369 --> 00:04:02,403
With numerous awards and over
thirty years of experience,

7
00:04:02,405 --> 00:04:06,374
Harrison Homes has
become a household name.

8
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:09,244
Our rich legacy,
born from hard work,

9
00:04:09,246 --> 00:04:11,913
a devotion to quality and
customer empathy ensures that

10
00:04:11,915 --> 00:04:17,352
you find the perfect new home
for you and your loved ones.

11
00:04:17,354 --> 00:04:19,921
We know you have a special
connection with your family

12
00:04:19,923 --> 00:04:23,391
and want a home that
feels just as special.

13
00:04:23,393 --> 00:04:25,760
You have many choices
when buying a home.

14
00:04:25,762 --> 00:04:28,263
That's why we've built a
company that builds

15
00:04:28,265 --> 00:04:30,498
so much more than quality homes.

16
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:33,501
At Harrison Homes

17
00:04:33,503 --> 00:04:35,303
we don't just build homes,

18
00:04:35,305 --> 00:04:38,773
we build community.

19
00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:40,275
Bullshit.

20
00:04:40,277 --> 00:04:44,746
They forgot to mention the
depressing unfinished lots.

21
00:04:44,748 --> 00:04:46,514
Morning Kiddo.

22
00:04:46,516 --> 00:04:48,049
Coffee ready?

23
00:04:48,051 --> 00:04:50,618
We're out of the ergo chuck, but
we still have some instant.

24
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,487
Gross.

25
00:04:52,489 --> 00:04:53,721
Right, I almost forgot

26
00:04:53,723 --> 00:04:56,557
you inherited your
father's coffee snobbery.

27
00:04:57,794 --> 00:04:59,394
Maddie up yet?

28
00:04:59,396 --> 00:05:00,962
I dunno.

29
00:05:04,067 --> 00:05:05,800
You should ask me something.

30
00:05:05,802 --> 00:05:07,001
Like what?

31
00:05:07,003 --> 00:05:08,486
I don't know.

32
00:05:08,487 --> 00:05:09,970
Isn't there something new
you want to learn about me?

33
00:05:09,973 --> 00:05:12,807
Or, I don't know.

34
00:05:12,809 --> 00:05:15,610
No, I think I've got you
pretty much figured out.

35
00:05:15,612 --> 00:05:16,711
Damn.

36
00:05:16,712 --> 00:05:17,811
Here I was thinking
I was all was all

37
00:05:17,814 --> 00:05:19,547
dark and mysterious and shit.

38
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,917
OK.

39
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:23,985
Favorite movie?

40
00:05:23,987 --> 00:05:25,920
Reanimator, that was easy.

41
00:05:25,922 --> 00:05:27,722
Favorite non-horror movie?

42
00:05:27,724 --> 00:05:30,425
Oh, that's a good one.

43
00:05:30,427 --> 00:05:32,960
Ahhh, I wanna say,

44
00:05:32,962 --> 00:05:35,463
Weekend at Bernie's.

45
00:05:35,465 --> 00:05:37,432
No, Weekend at Bernie's part 2.

46
00:05:37,434 --> 00:05:39,100
That one's sick.

47
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:40,767
Is that the one with the
dancing dead dude on vacation?

48
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,104
Yeah, it's awesome.

49
00:05:44,974 --> 00:05:46,607
You've never seen it?

50
00:05:46,609 --> 00:05:48,443
Sorry old man but
you're the only one

51
00:05:48,445 --> 00:05:49,577
who knows it exists.

52
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:51,012
Ah, Maddie.

53
00:05:51,014 --> 00:05:53,514
Alright, double feature
next weekend.

54
00:05:53,516 --> 00:05:54,749
And what are you
going to do for me?

55
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:58,119
I'll introduce you to
two comedy classics?

56
00:05:58,121 --> 00:05:59,687
- And?
- Pizza?

57
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:00,755
Deal.

58
00:06:00,757 --> 00:06:01,856
Awesome.

59
00:06:01,858 --> 00:06:03,458
Now, you ask me something.

60
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,625
This is actually kind of fun.

61
00:06:04,627 --> 00:06:06,994
Alright.

62
00:06:06,996 --> 00:06:08,363
Favorite band?

63
00:06:08,365 --> 00:06:09,464
Sabbath.

64
00:06:09,466 --> 00:06:11,366
You already know that.

65
00:06:11,368 --> 00:06:13,468
Something harder.

66
00:06:15,438 --> 00:06:17,939
OK.

67
00:06:17,941 --> 00:06:21,809
If you could kill anyone
and get away with it,

68
00:06:21,811 --> 00:06:25,380
who would it be and
how would you do it?

69
00:06:25,382 --> 00:06:27,749
Likely everyone's
first choice, Hitler.

70
00:06:27,751 --> 00:06:29,484
No.

71
00:06:29,486 --> 00:06:31,052
It's got to be someone real.

72
00:06:31,054 --> 00:06:32,453
Hitler wasn't real?

73
00:06:32,455 --> 00:06:33,654
No.

74
00:06:33,656 --> 00:06:35,623
Like someone you know.

75
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,059
A family member or
someone from school.

76
00:06:40,897 --> 00:06:43,564
I'll go with no one
then, you creep.

77
00:06:45,502 --> 00:06:47,168
Why, who would you kill?

78
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,775
Still can't believe I'm
letting her date an older boy.

79
00:06:53,777 --> 00:06:56,177
I should probably check
to see if it's even legal.

80
00:06:56,179 --> 00:06:57,412
I Googled it.

81
00:06:57,414 --> 00:06:58,679
It's totally legal.

82
00:06:58,681 --> 00:07:01,649
Still super gross though.

83
00:07:01,651 --> 00:07:03,151
I guess she is nineteen.

84
00:07:03,152 --> 00:07:04,652
She can pretty much
date whoever she pleases.

85
00:07:04,654 --> 00:07:06,821
I mean, I'd
let her have this one.

86
00:07:06,823 --> 00:07:08,856
She's got enough drama with
the move and everything.

87
00:07:08,858 --> 00:07:10,691
Interfering now
would likely cause

88
00:07:10,693 --> 00:07:12,927
some kind of Romeo and
Juliet situation.

89
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:14,796
I know.

90
00:07:14,797 --> 00:07:16,664
I don't like moving
any more than you kids, but

91
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,933
I think we can make
this place cool, right?

92
00:07:18,935 --> 00:07:21,102
It's a thousand times
better than the townhouse.

93
00:07:21,104 --> 00:07:22,570
You did good, Mom.

94
00:07:22,572 --> 00:07:24,071
When did you get so mature?

95
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:26,641
Aw!

96
00:07:26,643 --> 00:07:27,742
I take it back!

97
00:07:27,744 --> 00:07:28,976
You little pig.

98
00:07:30,947 --> 00:07:33,714
It is a pretty nice
place though, isn't it?

99
00:07:33,716 --> 00:07:35,716
Nicest place I've ever lived.

100
00:07:35,718 --> 00:07:37,752
Yeah, but we're
not exactly surrounded

101
00:07:37,754 --> 00:07:38,820
by the coolest of people.

102
00:07:38,822 --> 00:07:40,988
There's some cool people.

103
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,824
Alice is cool.

104
00:07:42,826 --> 00:07:43,958
She's cute too.

105
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,193
Don't be gross.

106
00:07:47,831 --> 00:07:49,130
Morning, Maddie!

107
00:07:51,234 --> 00:07:52,200
You trying to get rid of me?

108
00:07:52,202 --> 00:07:53,885
I feel so used.

109
00:07:53,886 --> 00:07:55,569
OK, seriously, my Mom's
gonna hear you.

110
00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:56,904
OK, just one more.

111
00:07:56,906 --> 00:07:58,172
OK.

112
00:08:00,543 --> 00:08:02,543
OK, I'm gone.

113
00:08:02,545 --> 00:08:03,644
Hurry!

114
00:08:03,646 --> 00:08:05,146
I've got to pee!

115
00:08:06,983 --> 00:08:09,250
Nice view.

116
00:08:09,252 --> 00:08:12,987
You pervert!

117
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,256
Hey, I'll see you later.

118
00:08:18,261 --> 00:08:21,529
Looks like Grandpa
Sandy without his dentures.

119
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:24,131
Be nice!

120
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:25,933
Messaging Lucifer?

121
00:08:25,935 --> 00:08:27,068
Luther!

122
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,903
And it's none of your business.

123
00:08:28,904 --> 00:08:30,737
I just think it's cute you
found someone as emo as you.

124
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,973
Don't you have to school today?

125
00:08:31,975 --> 00:08:34,041
No, I got Fridays off, remember?

126
00:08:34,043 --> 00:08:36,043
Don't you have work?

127
00:08:36,045 --> 00:08:37,812
What does it look like?

128
00:08:37,814 --> 00:08:40,014
Considering we all
have the day off,

129
00:08:40,016 --> 00:08:43,184
would you kids like to
do something together?

130
00:08:43,186 --> 00:08:44,619
Like what?

131
00:08:44,621 --> 00:08:47,088
There's not really
much to do around here.

132
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,156
We could go to the zoo.

133
00:08:49,158 --> 00:08:51,225
No thanks.

134
00:08:51,226 --> 00:08:53,293
Didn't you read about the
eight dead penguins last week?

135
00:08:53,296 --> 00:08:55,029
It was just a
suggestion, Maddie.

136
00:08:55,031 --> 00:08:57,064
She's just worried the reptile
exhibit will remind her

137
00:08:57,066 --> 00:08:58,766
of her ex-boyfriends.

138
00:08:58,768 --> 00:08:59,800
At least I have an ex.

139
00:08:59,802 --> 00:09:01,802
Kids, it's early!

140
00:09:01,804 --> 00:09:04,005
Put a pin in it for a sec.

141
00:09:09,178 --> 00:09:10,211
Is everything OK, Maddie?

142
00:09:10,213 --> 00:09:13,180
You seem a little on edge.

143
00:09:13,182 --> 00:09:15,249
I didn't sleep very
well last night.

144
00:09:15,251 --> 00:09:18,920
I'm sorry to hear, but can
you at least try to be nice.

145
00:09:18,922 --> 00:09:19,954
Sorry, Mom.

146
00:09:24,027 --> 00:09:28,296
Is it too early to play?

147
00:09:28,298 --> 00:09:29,664
Nope!

148
00:09:33,636 --> 00:09:34,802
What?

149
00:09:34,804 --> 00:09:38,072
I just love you, is all.

150
00:09:38,074 --> 00:09:39,740
I made you from scratch.

151
00:09:39,742 --> 00:09:41,809
Mom!

152
00:09:41,811 --> 00:09:43,344
Go a little easy on me, hey?

153
00:09:43,346 --> 00:09:45,913
Whatever, you kicked
my ass last time.

154
00:09:45,915 --> 00:09:47,348
Oh!

155
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:49,350
We both just died I think.

156
00:10:06,235 --> 00:10:07,969
Weird.

157
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,177
Nope.

158
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:18,980
Nope.

159
00:10:18,982 --> 00:10:21,849
Too serious.

160
00:10:21,851 --> 00:10:23,851
Way too young!

161
00:10:23,853 --> 00:10:27,154
Why would this child even set
his range as high as mine?

162
00:10:27,156 --> 00:10:28,389
How do I get this stupid
thing off my phone?

163
00:10:28,391 --> 00:10:29,724
Hey guys, there's
some dude running around

164
00:10:29,726 --> 00:10:31,376
barefoot out there!

165
00:10:31,377 --> 00:10:33,027
The young ones are
just on a 'cougar hunt'

166
00:10:33,029 --> 00:10:36,230
and the men my age are
looking for girls half my age.

167
00:10:36,232 --> 00:10:37,865
Be patient, Mom.

168
00:10:37,867 --> 00:10:40,968
It's a numbers game.

169
00:10:40,969 --> 00:10:44,070
That's very nice Maddie,
but I'm not going to rush into anything.

170
00:10:44,073 --> 00:10:46,140
Especially not
with Russell here.

171
00:10:46,142 --> 00:10:47,908
His profile picture is a pizza!

172
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:50,111
If you guys are done, you
should just quit so I can play.

173
00:10:50,113 --> 00:10:51,412
Don't interrupt, Nerd.

174
00:10:51,414 --> 00:10:53,381
OK, well whoever
dies first, I'm next, OK?

175
00:10:56,052 --> 00:10:57,184
No, I'm gonna take my time,

176
00:10:57,186 --> 00:10:59,754
I'll try dating
the old fashioned way.

177
00:10:59,756 --> 00:11:03,057
Who knows, may Lewis
knows some people.

178
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:04,125
Not likely!

179
00:11:04,127 --> 00:11:06,127
Lewis? That guy sucks.

180
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:07,328
Remember how mad he
got at your fortieth

181
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,897
when you let me
and Tim have a beer?

182
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,232
He called you so many names.

183
00:11:12,935 --> 00:11:14,518
Immature, rebellious,
irresponsible!

184
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,102
Can't those jerks go one
morning without construction?

185
00:11:16,105 --> 00:11:18,305
I told you this neighborhood
will never be finished.

186
00:11:18,307 --> 00:11:21,042
I think he even called you a
dirty hippie at one point.

187
00:11:21,044 --> 00:11:23,210
He was very drunk that night.

188
00:11:23,212 --> 00:11:24,779
He apologized.

189
00:11:24,781 --> 00:11:26,447
Yeah, like months later.

190
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:29,316
Even just last week, he got
so angry when we left those

191
00:11:29,318 --> 00:11:31,919
cardboard boxes on
the lawn overnight.

192
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:33,320
Dude is so anal.

193
00:11:33,322 --> 00:11:35,389
Did you know that term
comes from when babies won't

194
00:11:35,391 --> 00:11:38,292
poo as an act of control
over their parents?

195
00:11:38,294 --> 00:11:39,927
Ew.

196
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:41,796
I don't even want to
know how you know that.

197
00:11:41,798 --> 00:11:42,930
I read.

198
00:11:42,932 --> 00:11:43,964
You should try it sometime.

199
00:11:43,966 --> 00:11:45,199
I do read, you turd!

200
00:11:45,201 --> 00:11:46,834
Kids, sometimes
you have to be nice

201
00:11:46,836 --> 00:11:49,153
to people that you don't like

202
00:11:49,154 --> 00:11:51,471
in order to stay friends with
the people that you do like.

203
00:11:51,474 --> 00:11:56,410
Lewis may be difficult
but Alice is worth it.

204
00:11:56,412 --> 00:11:57,478
I'll say.

205
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,146
God, you're gross.

206
00:11:59,148 --> 00:12:02,750
No package from your dad today?

207
00:12:02,752 --> 00:12:04,251
No.

208
00:12:06,355 --> 00:12:08,222
It's early still.

209
00:12:10,927 --> 00:12:12,927
I bet it shows up later.

210
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:14,829
I don't know why
you don't just stream it.

211
00:12:14,831 --> 00:12:16,831
Do they even make DVDs anymore?

212
00:12:16,833 --> 00:12:19,100
A, it's a Blu-ray
and 2, special features.

213
00:12:19,102 --> 00:12:21,402
Speaking of your father,

214
00:12:21,404 --> 00:12:24,238
can you guys have him pick
up that box of random crap

215
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,107
when he comes to grab
you next weekend?

216
00:12:28,745 --> 00:12:30,845
Why don't you just
tell him yourself?

217
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,279
What was that Maddie?

218
00:12:32,281 --> 00:12:33,281
Nothing.

219
00:12:35,251 --> 00:12:36,751
What are those?

220
00:12:36,753 --> 00:12:37,818
I don't know.

221
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,186
You didn't even look.

222
00:12:39,188 --> 00:12:41,989
Those red envelopes,
what are they?

223
00:12:41,991 --> 00:12:44,125
I'm guessing some junk
telling us how to become

224
00:12:44,127 --> 00:12:46,393
millionaires in
three simple steps.

225
00:12:46,395 --> 00:12:47,862
You are no help.

226
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:02,143
Weird, it's addressed to me.

227
00:13:02,145 --> 00:13:03,277
The others are for you two.

228
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,478
Wedding invitations?

229
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,880
Maybe.

230
00:13:05,881 --> 00:13:07,281
Pretty creepy choice for
a wedding invitation.

231
00:13:07,283 --> 00:13:08,666
Creepy?

232
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:10,050
Wait, are you and
Lucifer getting married?

233
00:13:10,052 --> 00:13:11,118
What?

234
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,703
Shut up, loser!

235
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:14,287
Oh my God, I can picture it
now, black candles,

236
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,824
a Nine Inch Nails cover band
playing 'Hurt' as you walk

237
00:13:16,826 --> 00:13:19,527
down the aisle, hands bound
together in black leather

238
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:22,897
and Dad standing there, shaking
his head in disappointment.

239
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:25,900
I said shut the fuck up!

240
00:13:25,902 --> 00:13:28,169
Did you just throw
a banana at me?

241
00:13:28,171 --> 00:13:30,304
You need to relax,
I was only joking.

242
00:13:30,306 --> 00:13:32,439
Jokes are supposed
to be funny, Asshole.

243
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:34,175
Stop it you two!

244
00:13:38,915 --> 00:13:41,849
What are those,
wedding invitations?

245
00:13:43,452 --> 00:13:45,553
Very funny.

246
00:13:45,555 --> 00:13:47,454
Here, there's one
for each of us.

247
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,525
So, what is it?

248
00:14:24,527 --> 00:14:25,626
Hang on.

249
00:14:27,597 --> 00:14:29,263
Hang on.

250
00:14:33,502 --> 00:14:35,135
Is this some kind of joke?

251
00:14:39,342 --> 00:14:40,507
What?

252
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:41,509
What does it say?

253
00:14:44,247 --> 00:14:45,946
Who would send such a thing?

254
00:14:45,948 --> 00:14:47,147
Mom?

255
00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:48,282
Tim, Honey?

256
00:14:48,284 --> 00:14:50,150
Does that letter tell you to.

257
00:14:50,152 --> 00:14:51,652
Kill someone?

258
00:14:51,654 --> 00:14:52,953
Sure does.

259
00:14:52,955 --> 00:14:54,889
What?

260
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:56,507
Red Letter Day.

261
00:14:56,508 --> 00:14:58,124
How much do you trust the
world outside the comfort

262
00:14:58,127 --> 00:15:00,060
of your manicured reality?

263
00:15:00,062 --> 00:15:02,396
How well do you know your
friends and neighbors outside of

264
00:15:02,398 --> 00:15:05,532
the safe bubble of
your online persona?

265
00:15:05,534 --> 00:15:07,201
Welcome to Red Letter Day.

266
00:15:07,203 --> 00:15:09,536
Your instructions
are as follows:

267
00:15:09,538 --> 00:15:12,907
kill this person
before they kill you.

268
00:15:12,909 --> 00:15:15,676
The person in this photo has
been selected using data

269
00:15:15,678 --> 00:15:17,544
from your online activity.

270
00:15:17,546 --> 00:15:20,447
You have been matched with
someone with conflicting beliefs

271
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:23,250
within five kilometers
of your residence.

272
00:15:23,252 --> 00:15:25,152
They too have been
sent this same letter

273
00:15:25,154 --> 00:15:26,687
with your image and address.

274
00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:29,056
Happy hunting and good luck.

275
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:32,293
Then there is an address
below Alice's photo.

276
00:15:32,295 --> 00:15:34,662
Mine says the exact same thing

277
00:15:34,663 --> 00:15:37,030
except for it's just a picture
of some random bald dude.

278
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:38,198
Maddie, what does yours say?

279
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,300
I'm not opening that.

280
00:15:39,302 --> 00:15:41,302
Knowing my luck,
you probably got me.

281
00:15:41,304 --> 00:15:42,436
Don't you dare!

282
00:15:42,438 --> 00:15:43,470
Chill out, Maddie.

283
00:15:43,472 --> 00:15:44,571
It's just some dumb prank.

284
00:15:44,573 --> 00:15:46,290
Chill out?

285
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:48,008
We received letters
telling us to kill people!

286
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,576
I'm sorry,
if I'm finding it kinda difficult

287
00:15:49,578 --> 00:15:51,312
to take this seriously.

288
00:15:51,314 --> 00:15:52,379
I mean look at this dude!

289
00:15:52,381 --> 00:15:54,215
The only thing he's murdering is

290
00:15:54,216 --> 00:15:56,050
a full series of
Firefly in one sitting.

291
00:15:56,052 --> 00:15:57,618
This isn't funny, Tim!

292
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,719
OK, just calm down,

293
00:15:58,721 --> 00:16:00,354
OK, calm down.

294
00:16:00,356 --> 00:16:03,090
For all we know, we're the only
people who received these.

295
00:16:03,092 --> 00:16:05,459
OK, let's just open your letter
then I'll call the police.

296
00:16:05,461 --> 00:16:06,560
No!

297
00:16:06,562 --> 00:16:08,729
I want no part of this!

298
00:16:08,731 --> 00:16:11,565
If you guys want to play this
stupid game, then that's on you.

299
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:13,667
Me? I want nothing to
do with this shit.

300
00:16:13,669 --> 00:16:14,969
Maddie, come-

301
00:16:21,344 --> 00:16:23,610
How about we just give
her a minute to calm down, hey?

302
00:16:23,612 --> 00:16:25,346
Yeah.

303
00:16:25,348 --> 00:16:26,380
You're probably right.

304
00:16:26,382 --> 00:16:27,748
It's likely just
some dumb prank,

305
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,085
but I should call the police.

306
00:16:31,087 --> 00:16:32,486
Give me a minute.

307
00:16:36,392 --> 00:16:38,225
911, what's your emergency?

308
00:16:38,227 --> 00:16:40,627
I think my family
has been threatened.

309
00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:44,031
We received letters
telling us to kill somebody

310
00:16:44,033 --> 00:16:45,632
before they kill us.

311
00:16:45,634 --> 00:16:48,502
Who the hell is this dude?

312
00:16:48,504 --> 00:16:50,537
Is there anybody in
your home threatening you presently?

313
00:16:50,539 --> 00:16:52,573
No, not presently.

314
00:16:52,575 --> 00:16:54,174
Thank you.

315
00:16:54,176 --> 00:16:56,243
Connecting you with the
Lakeview police department.

316
00:17:02,385 --> 00:17:06,787
Hello, I'd like to
report a threat on my life.

317
00:17:06,789 --> 00:17:09,156
Is there someone threatening
you in person right now, Miss?

318
00:17:09,158 --> 00:17:11,158
No, not presently.

319
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,526
I received a strange letter.

320
00:17:12,528 --> 00:17:14,912
A letter?

321
00:17:14,913 --> 00:17:17,297
Yeah, this letter tells me
to kill one of my neighbors

322
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:19,099
before they kill me.

323
00:17:19,101 --> 00:17:21,402
It says that they
received the same letter.

324
00:17:21,404 --> 00:17:24,171
Have you tried discussing
this with your neighbor?

325
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:25,940
No.

326
00:17:25,941 --> 00:17:27,708
I literally just received
this, and thought that I should

327
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:31,545
notify you first in case any
other letters had been reported.

328
00:17:35,418 --> 00:17:36,617
It's likely just a prank.

329
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:39,153
Do you have children?

330
00:17:39,155 --> 00:17:41,939
Yes, I have children.

331
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,724
Look, I really don't need
to be patronized right now.

332
00:17:44,727 --> 00:17:46,527
What would you like us to do?

333
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:48,662
Your job maybe?

334
00:17:48,664 --> 00:17:52,299
You could, I don't know,
look into this or something!

335
00:17:55,171 --> 00:17:58,105
I am cooperating, just please.

336
00:17:58,107 --> 00:18:00,574
I'll give you any
information that you need.

337
00:18:00,576 --> 00:18:03,710
OK, we can send an
officer out to look into this

338
00:18:03,712 --> 00:18:05,746
tonight at six.

339
00:18:05,748 --> 00:18:06,847
What?

340
00:18:06,849 --> 00:18:08,849
That's...

341
00:18:08,851 --> 00:18:11,085
That's nine hours from now!

342
00:18:15,858 --> 00:18:18,192
Your life isn't
in any immediate danger?

343
00:18:18,194 --> 00:18:19,760
Well, yes.

344
00:18:19,762 --> 00:18:21,728
I'm not in any immediate danger.

345
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,264
Well, if that status
changes, contact us again

346
00:18:24,266 --> 00:18:25,866
and someone will
be there in moments.

347
00:18:31,874 --> 00:18:33,807
Well, that was horrible.

348
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:35,309
What did they say?

349
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:37,144
They're sending a cop at six.

350
00:18:37,146 --> 00:18:38,879
Christ.

351
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,613
Are you gonna see if
Alice got the same thing?

352
00:18:40,616 --> 00:18:42,349
Yeah.

353
00:18:42,351 --> 00:18:43,784
I'll give her a call in a bit.

354
00:18:43,786 --> 00:18:45,486
First, let me see your letter.

355
00:18:50,526 --> 00:18:53,427
Joe Dennis?

356
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:54,528
Are you sure you
don't know this man?

357
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,396
Never seen him
before in my life.

358
00:18:58,234 --> 00:18:59,700
Wait, is this the guy that

359
00:18:59,702 --> 00:19:01,368
walks his cat?

360
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:03,504
You know, the weird balding one?

361
00:19:03,506 --> 00:19:06,507
You know, I remember the cat
but not the dude.

362
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:09,176
I think this is pretty close.

363
00:19:09,178 --> 00:19:11,745
Well, I did just
unpack my telescope.

364
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,320
I'll be there in a second.

365
00:19:25,394 --> 00:19:27,928
Honey,

366
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:30,631
we're going to spy on the
neighbors, want to join?

367
00:19:30,633 --> 00:19:31,698
No!

368
00:19:35,271 --> 00:19:37,538
OK, let's take a look here.

369
00:19:42,545 --> 00:19:43,610
Tim?

370
00:19:43,612 --> 00:19:44,811
What?

371
00:19:46,682 --> 00:19:47,814
Holy shit!

372
00:19:47,816 --> 00:19:49,283
That's totally a fluke Mom!

373
00:19:49,284 --> 00:19:50,751
We bought you this
to look at the stars.

374
00:19:50,753 --> 00:19:52,186
Not to be a creep.

375
00:19:52,187 --> 00:19:53,620
Honestly, I haven't used that
thing since I unpacked it.

376
00:19:53,622 --> 00:19:55,239
I swear on my life.

377
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,857
Do we need to have another
discussion about consent?

378
00:19:56,859 --> 00:19:57,958
Mom!

379
00:19:59,862 --> 00:20:01,295
Alright.

380
00:20:01,297 --> 00:20:02,930
I believe you.

381
00:20:02,932 --> 00:20:04,198
Come on, Creep.

382
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,200
Let's get creeping.

383
00:20:11,607 --> 00:20:15,309
Looks like Professor X
hasn't checked his mail yet.

384
00:20:15,311 --> 00:20:16,977
Just kinda looks like
another boring morning

385
00:20:16,979 --> 00:20:18,612
in Aspen Ridge, doesn't it?

386
00:20:18,614 --> 00:20:20,614
Yeah.

387
00:20:20,616 --> 00:20:22,950
Hang on a sec.

388
00:20:22,952 --> 00:20:24,218
I think this is him.

389
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,886
Let me see!

390
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:31,858
That's totally him!

391
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,927
Oh good, it looks like
he's leaving for the day.

392
00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:35,329
One less thing to worry about.

393
00:20:38,734 --> 00:20:40,367
Does he have a
letter in his mailbox?

394
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:42,419
Can't tell.

395
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,470
It's one of those
old school ones on a post.

396
00:20:49,645 --> 00:20:53,347
You know, this is
actually kind of fun.

397
00:20:53,349 --> 00:20:56,650
Aside from the creepy
letters and everything.

398
00:20:58,954 --> 00:21:01,888
What's sporty Kevin
Smith is up to over here?

399
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,760
Damn, looks like
he also got a letter.

400
00:21:06,762 --> 00:21:08,362
Let me see.

401
00:21:23,912 --> 00:21:25,812
Christ.

402
00:21:29,818 --> 00:21:32,786
You know, now would
probably be a good time to

403
00:21:32,788 --> 00:21:35,389
give Alice a call.

404
00:21:35,391 --> 00:21:36,556
Yeah.

405
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,399
Mel!

406
00:21:45,401 --> 00:21:46,733
Hey Ali.

407
00:21:46,735 --> 00:21:50,971
Hang on a sec.

408
00:21:50,973 --> 00:21:53,573
I'm guessing you received
one of those stupid letters too?

409
00:21:53,575 --> 00:21:56,076
Yeah, pretty messed up, hey?

410
00:21:56,078 --> 00:21:58,078
Oh God!

411
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,081
Looks like I'm dealing with
a bit of a Poo-naumi over here.

412
00:22:01,083 --> 00:22:02,416
You have my sympathy.

413
00:22:02,418 --> 00:22:06,086
Lewis, a little help over here?

414
00:22:06,088 --> 00:22:07,387
Sorry about this, Mel.

415
00:22:07,389 --> 00:22:08,855
Look, do you mind
just swinging by

416
00:22:08,857 --> 00:22:10,424
for a cup of tea or something?

417
00:22:10,426 --> 00:22:12,759
Visit me and this stinky baby?

418
00:22:12,761 --> 00:22:13,827
Yeah.

419
00:22:13,829 --> 00:22:15,829
Sure, I can come
by in a little bit.

420
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:19,566
OK, chat soon.

421
00:22:19,568 --> 00:22:21,835
You made a big mess.

422
00:22:21,837 --> 00:22:23,537
You made a big mess.

423
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:24,871
Yes, you did.

424
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,583
Mom, please.

425
00:22:36,585 --> 00:22:37,851
You don't need to do this.

426
00:22:37,853 --> 00:22:39,586
She's just a few houses down.

427
00:22:39,588 --> 00:22:41,888
I'll be ten minutes,
fifteen tops.

428
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,123
But what if-

429
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:44,875
Maddie, come on.

430
00:22:44,876 --> 00:22:46,626
This is Alice
we're talking about here.

431
00:22:46,628 --> 00:22:47,928
At least, take this.

432
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,529
For protection.

433
00:22:49,531 --> 00:22:51,932
Tim, put that back right now!

434
00:22:51,934 --> 00:22:53,400
I think we should just call Dad.

435
00:22:53,402 --> 00:22:56,136
OK, come on, look,
whoever sent these letters

436
00:22:56,138 --> 00:22:58,905
is trying to get us
to behave irrationally

437
00:22:58,907 --> 00:23:02,142
for their own sick
pleasure or whatever.

438
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,044
I think we should just call Dad.

439
00:23:04,046 --> 00:23:06,046
He would know what to do.

440
00:23:06,048 --> 00:23:07,581
I can assure
you that your father

441
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:09,616
would not keep his cool
in this situation.

442
00:23:09,618 --> 00:23:12,652
He would likely just
barricade all the windows.

443
00:23:12,654 --> 00:23:14,921
Maybe that's not
such a bad idea.

444
00:23:14,923 --> 00:23:16,523
It's better than
what you've got!

445
00:23:20,062 --> 00:23:21,762
Look, just stay here.

446
00:23:21,764 --> 00:23:23,430
I'll be back soon.

447
00:23:30,606 --> 00:23:31,805
We good?

448
00:23:31,807 --> 00:23:33,540
I love you.

449
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:36,293
I love you too, Tim,

450
00:23:36,294 --> 00:23:39,045
but let's not act like it's
the end of the world, OK?

451
00:23:39,047 --> 00:23:40,647
Take care, Maddie.

452
00:23:42,851 --> 00:23:45,185
Oh, and lock the
door behind me, OK?

453
00:25:17,045 --> 00:25:20,780
Hey, you're probably still in
the air but I just wanted to

454
00:25:20,782 --> 00:25:25,018
let you know there's some
really weird shit going on.

455
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,753
I'm sure once you land,
you'll hear all about it,

456
00:25:26,755 --> 00:25:29,756
but we just didn't
want you to worry.

457
00:25:29,758 --> 00:25:33,793
We're safe for now, even if
Mom did leave us home alone.

458
00:25:36,064 --> 00:25:38,532
Call back when you get this.

459
00:25:38,534 --> 00:25:40,834
I think you're being a
little too hard on Mom.

460
00:25:40,836 --> 00:25:41,902
She's trying her best.

461
00:25:41,904 --> 00:25:43,270
Whatever.

462
00:25:43,271 --> 00:25:44,637
What kind of parent
leaves her children alone

463
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,705
during a time like this?

464
00:25:45,707 --> 00:25:47,757
Give me a break, Maddie.

465
00:25:47,758 --> 00:25:49,808
I mean, she's literally
ten houses down in Aspen Ridge.

466
00:25:49,811 --> 00:25:52,045
Maybe the lamest
neighborhood in the city.

467
00:25:52,047 --> 00:25:54,548
You might be taking these
letters a little too seriously.

468
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:57,817
I don't think you're
taking them seriously enough.

469
00:26:01,123 --> 00:26:02,822
Damn,

470
00:26:02,824 --> 00:26:04,324
people are sure
going nuts over this.

471
00:26:04,326 --> 00:26:06,860
Holy shit.

472
00:26:06,862 --> 00:26:09,095
Daria just posted a video
of her Dad fighting.

473
00:26:09,097 --> 00:26:10,230
Really? Let's see.

474
00:26:13,735 --> 00:26:15,035
You try to act
like you're innocent!

475
00:26:15,037 --> 00:26:16,559
Guess what?

476
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,082
ISIS don't mean shit
to me, Motherfucker!

477
00:26:18,083 --> 00:26:19,605
Listen, just get out of
here before I call the cops!

478
00:26:19,608 --> 00:26:21,074
ISIS don't mean shit to me!

479
00:26:21,076 --> 00:26:22,426
You try to scare me?

480
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:23,777
ISIS don't mean shit
to me motherfucker.

481
00:26:23,779 --> 00:26:25,078
ISIS? What are you
even talking about?

482
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,146
I was born in this country!

483
00:26:26,147 --> 00:26:27,213
My parents were born
in this country.

484
00:26:27,214 --> 00:26:28,280
I'll bet it was
you ISIS fucks that

485
00:26:28,283 --> 00:26:30,750
even sent those letters, huh?

486
00:26:30,752 --> 00:26:31,818
You wanna kill me?

487
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,953
You wanna fucking kill me?

488
00:26:32,955 --> 00:26:33,987
Come on, take your best shot!

489
00:26:33,989 --> 00:26:35,088
You're a loser.

490
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:36,156
You're not even worth my time.

491
00:26:36,157 --> 00:26:37,223
What the fuck did
you just say to me?

492
00:26:37,225 --> 00:26:38,625
What the fuck did you?

493
00:26:38,627 --> 00:26:40,927
Jesus Christ.

494
00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:43,830
What the fuck is
wrong with people?

495
00:26:43,832 --> 00:26:45,865
I knew this was the type
of shit that was hidden

496
00:26:45,867 --> 00:26:47,484
underneath the surface.

497
00:26:47,485 --> 00:26:49,102
I just figured most
of it was in the U.S.

498
00:26:49,104 --> 00:26:53,139
Rednecks like that are just
always looking for an excuse.

499
00:26:53,141 --> 00:26:54,641
People are shit.

500
00:26:54,643 --> 00:26:55,976
Try not to get too
cynical, Maddie.

501
00:26:55,978 --> 00:26:57,978
I mean, there's
plenty of good people.

502
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,779
We're good people.

503
00:26:59,781 --> 00:27:01,715
Whatever you say.

504
00:27:01,717 --> 00:27:04,017
I just hope Daria is okay.

505
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:07,887
Looks like there's a group
taking credit for the letters.

506
00:27:07,889 --> 00:27:09,723
The Unknown?

507
00:27:09,725 --> 00:27:11,157
There's a video.

508
00:27:13,128 --> 00:27:15,328
Welcome to the
inaugural Red Letter Day

509
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:18,031
presented by your
friends at The Unknown.

510
00:27:18,033 --> 00:27:20,133
Each of you has been
assigned one person to kill

511
00:27:20,135 --> 00:27:22,202
before they kill you.

512
00:27:22,204 --> 00:27:24,270
What you do next is up to you.

513
00:27:24,272 --> 00:27:26,773
For too long have we been
categorized and separated

514
00:27:26,775 --> 00:27:29,409
in the name of
profit and control.

515
00:27:29,411 --> 00:27:31,911
Today, we engage.

516
00:27:31,913 --> 00:27:34,748
Will kindness and manners
prevail, or will the true

517
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:38,118
self-serving nature of
humankind rear its ugly head?

518
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,055
Stay tuned and happy hunting.

519
00:27:42,057 --> 00:27:46,426
What the fuck was that?

520
00:27:46,428 --> 00:27:49,329
Maybe we shouldn't have
let Mom go to Alice's.

521
00:27:54,436 --> 00:27:56,670
Play it again.

522
00:28:43,118 --> 00:28:45,051
It's just Mel,
ya big scaredy cat!

523
00:28:45,053 --> 00:28:46,953
Boo!

524
00:28:46,955 --> 00:28:48,121
Come in, come in.

525
00:28:51,993 --> 00:28:53,493
Damn!

526
00:28:53,494 --> 00:28:54,994
Somehow your house has
become even more beautiful

527
00:28:54,996 --> 00:28:56,262
than the last time I saw it.

528
00:28:56,264 --> 00:28:57,964
Oh Mel, you're sweet.

529
00:28:57,966 --> 00:29:00,033
I don't think that much
has changed.

530
00:29:05,907 --> 00:29:07,741
Melanie.

531
00:29:07,743 --> 00:29:09,509
Lewis.

532
00:29:09,511 --> 00:29:11,978
Hello Lucy.

533
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,414
How's my favorite
little lady doing?

534
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:17,150
Looks like someone
missed their Auntie.

535
00:29:17,152 --> 00:29:18,451
Green or black tea?

536
00:29:18,453 --> 00:29:19,519
Green would be lovely.

537
00:29:19,521 --> 00:29:21,254
Here, let me get that for you.

538
00:29:21,256 --> 00:29:23,156
OK.

539
00:29:31,066 --> 00:29:32,932
Has he been getting
enough sleep lately?

540
00:29:32,934 --> 00:29:36,269
I'm sorry, he's been
like this all morning.

541
00:29:36,271 --> 00:29:38,572
Lewis!

542
00:29:38,573 --> 00:29:40,874
Make yourself useful and
put a kettle on for us.

543
00:29:40,876 --> 00:29:43,143
I hear you made a
little mess this morning!

544
00:29:43,145 --> 00:29:45,912
The little stinker.

545
00:29:45,914 --> 00:29:47,413
How is it only
nine AM and you've already

546
00:29:47,415 --> 00:29:49,082
managed to roast a chicken?

547
00:29:49,084 --> 00:29:51,017
I've been up since
four with Lucy.

548
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:52,852
We're trying to
cut out deli meat.

549
00:29:52,854 --> 00:29:55,288
I read about another Listeria
outbreak on Facebook.

550
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,924
One more reason to
become vegetarian, I guess.

551
00:29:57,926 --> 00:30:00,460
I would try, Lewis is more
of a red meat kind of guy.

552
00:30:02,197 --> 00:30:04,197
Residents of the
Calgary neighborhood of...

553
00:30:04,199 --> 00:30:06,466
Crazy start to the day, huh?

554
00:30:06,468 --> 00:30:10,570
Yeah, this is so messed up.

555
00:30:10,572 --> 00:30:13,173
Has anyone, you know?

556
00:30:13,175 --> 00:30:15,041
Not yet, as far as I know.

557
00:30:15,043 --> 00:30:17,911
They say to just to sit
tight until the police figure it out.

558
00:30:17,913 --> 00:30:20,446
If the dickhead I spoke
with this morning is on the case,

559
00:30:20,448 --> 00:30:22,482
I have no hope
of it being resolved.

560
00:30:22,484 --> 00:30:24,000
Have a little compassion.

561
00:30:24,001 --> 00:30:25,517
Imagine putting your
life on the line everyday

562
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,387
only to be treated
like an A-hole.

563
00:30:27,389 --> 00:30:28,988
Didn't you date a cop once?

564
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:31,090
Ssshhhhh.

565
00:30:34,129 --> 00:30:35,195
Thanks, Louie.

566
00:30:35,197 --> 00:30:37,130
Uh huh.

567
00:30:37,131 --> 00:30:39,064
An anarchist group
calling themselves the Unknown

568
00:30:39,067 --> 00:30:41,367
are taking responsibility.

569
00:30:44,139 --> 00:30:47,140
God, the news is so
depressing these days.

570
00:30:47,142 --> 00:30:49,242
Mixed with all of
these dystopian TV shows,

571
00:30:49,244 --> 00:30:50,944
you'd think the world is ending.

572
00:30:50,946 --> 00:30:52,512
We're not evening getting
cable in the new place.

573
00:30:52,514 --> 00:30:53,613
Pinching pennies are we?

574
00:30:53,615 --> 00:30:55,248
The kids don't
even watch it anymore

575
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,351
and I'd rather read a novel
or do something outside.

576
00:30:58,353 --> 00:30:59,485
To each their own.

577
00:31:06,228 --> 00:31:08,628
That's the picture
these Weirdos decided to use?

578
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,964
You look good!

579
00:31:10,966 --> 00:31:12,098
Thanks.

580
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:15,635
So, which picture
did they use for me?

581
00:31:15,637 --> 00:31:18,104
You were doing Yoga.

582
00:31:18,106 --> 00:31:19,806
Tim said you looked cute.

583
00:31:19,807 --> 00:31:21,507
Well, that's flattering.

584
00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:24,110
Crazy to think they
can just gather all our

585
00:31:24,112 --> 00:31:25,578
information on the internet.

586
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,380
It feels like such an
invasion of privacy.

587
00:31:27,382 --> 00:31:28,381
I know.

588
00:31:28,383 --> 00:31:29,983
It's a strange new world.

589
00:31:29,985 --> 00:31:31,384
All your most intimate details

590
00:31:31,386 --> 00:31:33,920
up to the highest bidder.

591
00:31:33,922 --> 00:31:35,421
It makes you want to
move to the mountains.

592
00:31:35,423 --> 00:31:37,523
I'd last about two week.

593
00:31:37,525 --> 00:31:39,893
Yeah, I guess we need to adapt.

594
00:31:39,895 --> 00:31:42,161
I mean, can you even remember
what you used to in a line-up,

595
00:31:42,163 --> 00:31:44,664
or the waiting room or in the
bathroom before you had a phone?

596
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:46,032
Magazines.

597
00:31:46,034 --> 00:31:47,533
Newspapers.

598
00:31:47,535 --> 00:31:48,968
Archie!

599
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:51,170
Oh yeah.

600
00:31:51,172 --> 00:31:54,140
I guess it's the same
thing, just digital.

601
00:31:54,142 --> 00:31:56,175
And now you can voice
all your thoughts without

602
00:31:56,177 --> 00:31:57,360
an opinions column.

603
00:31:57,361 --> 00:31:58,544
I try to stay away
from all that garbage,

604
00:31:58,546 --> 00:32:00,546
but sometimes you just
get sucked in.

605
00:32:00,548 --> 00:32:03,549
I just learned what
a cuck was last week.

606
00:32:03,551 --> 00:32:05,251
I don't even want to know!

607
00:32:08,223 --> 00:32:10,423
So, who did Lewis
get in his letter?

608
00:32:10,425 --> 00:32:14,460
I mean, you don't have to
if it's uncomfortable.

609
00:32:14,462 --> 00:32:16,696
Mrs. Miller.

610
00:32:16,697 --> 00:32:18,931
I don't know if you've met her
yet, but she is the cutest.

611
00:32:18,934 --> 00:32:20,700
Goes around every
Christmas with a tin of cookies

612
00:32:20,702 --> 00:32:22,969
for everyone in the community.

613
00:32:22,971 --> 00:32:24,971
Strange he'd be paired
with such a sweet old woman.

614
00:32:24,973 --> 00:32:27,573
I know, I mean I can't
believe their data or whatever

615
00:32:27,575 --> 00:32:29,442
paired you and I together.

616
00:32:29,444 --> 00:32:31,077
I mean you do vote
Conservative but.

617
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:32,645
When are you going to stop
grilling me about that?

618
00:32:32,647 --> 00:32:34,981
Last time, I promise.

619
00:32:34,983 --> 00:32:36,182
So who did the kids get?

620
00:32:36,184 --> 00:32:38,084
If you don't mind
me asking of course.

621
00:32:38,086 --> 00:32:39,836
Classic Maddie.

622
00:32:39,837 --> 00:32:41,587
She just ripped hers up and
stormed off to her room.

623
00:32:41,589 --> 00:32:43,656
Tim got this weird balding man.

624
00:32:43,658 --> 00:32:45,325
You might have seen
him walking his cat.

625
00:32:45,327 --> 00:32:47,327
That guy?

626
00:32:47,329 --> 00:32:48,661
Oh he's so weird.

627
00:32:48,663 --> 00:32:50,897
That cat barely moves.

628
00:32:50,898 --> 00:32:53,179
I swear, I see him carrying it
more than I see it walking.

629
00:32:57,973 --> 00:33:02,275
So, is Maddie still
seeing that older boy?

630
00:33:02,277 --> 00:33:03,676
Yeah but I can't blame her.

631
00:33:03,678 --> 00:33:06,346
I mean, I went through a
bad boy phase myself.

632
00:33:06,348 --> 00:33:07,413
More than once.

633
00:33:07,415 --> 00:33:09,315
Hell, I married one!

634
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:14,520
I shouldn't stay long.

635
00:33:14,522 --> 00:33:15,655
I just wanted to say that

636
00:33:15,657 --> 00:33:18,157
I'm not taking
this letter seriously.

637
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,525
Like, at all.

638
00:33:19,527 --> 00:33:21,094
I appreciate it.

639
00:33:21,096 --> 00:33:22,295
I was going to
call you right away,

640
00:33:22,297 --> 00:33:24,998
but I had to calm
Lewis down first.

641
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,511
You know how he gets.

642
00:33:26,512 --> 00:33:28,023
Yeah,
the kids are freaking out too.

643
00:33:28,024 --> 00:33:29,535
I tried telling them this was
likely just some dumb prank.

644
00:33:29,537 --> 00:33:32,271
Here's hoping.

645
00:33:32,273 --> 00:33:34,173
I should get back to the kids.

646
00:33:34,175 --> 00:33:37,643
So how are they adjusting to
the move and everything?

647
00:33:37,645 --> 00:33:41,147
Tim is taking it
like a champ but Maddie.

648
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:43,016
I think she still
really misses Kris.

649
00:33:43,018 --> 00:33:44,784
It's hard enough being 19.

650
00:33:44,786 --> 00:33:46,285
Just give it time.

651
00:33:46,287 --> 00:33:47,387
You got this.

652
00:33:47,389 --> 00:33:49,089
Thanks Ali.

653
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,790
Here's hoping they
finish that new complex soon.

654
00:33:50,792 --> 00:33:52,625
It would be great to
have a cinema nearby.

655
00:33:52,627 --> 00:33:56,429
Oh gees, I cannot remember the
last time we went to a movie.

656
00:33:56,431 --> 00:33:58,297
Not since Lucie was born anyway.

657
00:33:58,299 --> 00:34:02,268
Lewis, what was the last
show we saw in the theatres?

658
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,037
Lewis?

659
00:34:04,038 --> 00:34:05,805
Melanie, can you please
explain why you brought

660
00:34:05,807 --> 00:34:08,441
a large knife into my home?

661
00:34:39,674 --> 00:34:41,774
Lucifer still hasn't responded?

662
00:34:41,776 --> 00:34:43,309
Nope.

663
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:45,111
I wouldn't worry about it.

664
00:34:45,113 --> 00:34:49,449
His coffin likely hasn't
let in the morning light yet.

665
00:34:49,451 --> 00:34:52,452
Dick.

666
00:34:52,454 --> 00:34:56,422
Oh fuck, looks like they're
reporting a murder in town!

667
00:34:56,424 --> 00:34:58,474
What?

668
00:34:58,475 --> 00:35:00,525
"A custodian was attacked by
a masked man using a hatchet"

669
00:35:00,528 --> 00:35:03,629
at the Bass Pro Shop at
Crossiron Mills this morning.

670
00:35:03,631 --> 00:35:05,865
Police Services suspect that
this is the first known murder

671
00:35:05,867 --> 00:35:10,503
to occur in what is being
referred to as Red Letter Day.

672
00:35:10,505 --> 00:35:13,506
Police remind citizens to stay
inside and to keep all doors

673
00:35:13,508 --> 00:35:15,708
locked until more
information is known.

674
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:19,612
Follow updates online using the
hashtag #YYCredletterday for

675
00:35:19,614 --> 00:35:22,815
"more breaking news
as it happens."

676
00:35:22,817 --> 00:35:24,784
Bass Pro?

677
00:35:24,786 --> 00:35:30,389
Chances are this murder isn't
even related to the letters.

678
00:35:30,391 --> 00:35:32,525
It's wild.

679
00:35:32,527 --> 00:35:35,761
Just wild.

680
00:35:37,832 --> 00:35:38,898
Oh fuck!

681
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,433
Holy Fuck! Holy Fuck!

682
00:35:40,435 --> 00:35:41,501
Who is that Tim?

683
00:35:41,503 --> 00:35:43,058
Oh my God!

684
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:44,614
Maddie, I need you go upstairs
and call the police, OK?

685
00:35:44,615 --> 00:35:46,170
Go upstairs, lock the bathroom
door and call the police!

686
00:35:46,174 --> 00:35:47,240
Who is that man, Tim?

687
00:35:47,242 --> 00:35:48,386
Why is he here?

688
00:35:48,387 --> 00:35:49,531
It's the man from
my letter, Maddie!

689
00:35:49,532 --> 00:35:50,676
What the fuck,
why is he outside?

690
00:35:50,678 --> 00:35:51,794
Quickly Maddie!

691
00:35:51,795 --> 00:35:52,911
Please go upstairs
and call the police!

692
00:35:52,914 --> 00:35:54,213
What are you going to do?

693
00:35:54,215 --> 00:35:55,359
Come with me, please!

694
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,504
I'm going to lock the
doors and close the blinds, OK?

695
00:35:56,505 --> 00:35:57,649
I'll be right behind you.

696
00:35:57,652 --> 00:35:58,684
Why is this happening?

697
00:35:58,686 --> 00:35:59,919
Please Maddie, now!

698
00:36:01,689 --> 00:36:03,389
I'll be right behind
you, OK, just go!

699
00:36:09,797 --> 00:36:10,796
Please just hurry.

700
00:36:10,798 --> 00:36:12,832
He's in my house right now!

701
00:36:12,834 --> 00:36:14,867
I understand,
please stay where you are.

702
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:18,404
An officer will the
there in fifteen minutes.

703
00:36:18,406 --> 00:36:21,207
What the fuck am I
supposed to do until then?

704
00:36:21,209 --> 00:36:22,642
He's here now!

705
00:36:22,644 --> 00:36:24,477
My brother is still downstairs!

706
00:36:24,479 --> 00:36:25,945
Please stay where you are ma'am.

707
00:36:25,946 --> 00:36:27,412
They will be there
as soon as possible.

708
00:36:27,415 --> 00:36:28,948
Unfortunately, there is an
extremely high demand

709
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:30,950
for officers right now.

710
00:36:30,952 --> 00:36:32,952
I wish we could
do something sooner,

711
00:36:32,954 --> 00:36:34,720
but it is simply not possible!

712
00:36:53,441 --> 00:36:57,310
Please.

713
00:36:57,312 --> 00:36:58,545
Hello?

714
00:36:58,546 --> 00:36:59,779
Hello Madison are you
still with me?

715
00:36:59,781 --> 00:37:00,846
Madison?

716
00:37:00,848 --> 00:37:02,582
Madison?

717
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:04,717
Please just come help us!

718
00:37:18,433 --> 00:37:20,666
Alice please!

719
00:37:20,668 --> 00:37:22,335
I can explain.

720
00:37:22,336 --> 00:37:24,003
Tim tried to give me that
knife before I left the house,

721
00:37:24,005 --> 00:37:26,672
just in case something
happened and he must have

722
00:37:26,674 --> 00:37:28,341
slipped it into my
purse without me noticing.

723
00:37:28,343 --> 00:37:29,909
Right, and you just
didn't happen to notice

724
00:37:29,911 --> 00:37:32,478
a gigantic carving
knife in your purse?

725
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,880
Well, I'm so fucking sorry
Lewis, but as you may have

726
00:37:34,882 --> 00:37:37,650
noticed there's a lot of really
weird shit going on today.

727
00:37:37,652 --> 00:37:38,884
Stop it!

728
00:37:38,886 --> 00:37:40,920
Stop it you two!

729
00:37:40,922 --> 00:37:43,022
Mel, why would Tim put the knife
in there if he knew you were

730
00:37:43,024 --> 00:37:44,290
coming to my house?

731
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:46,259
He's just a dumb kid.

732
00:37:46,261 --> 00:37:47,994
I'm sure he thought he
was doing the right thing.

733
00:37:47,996 --> 00:37:52,031
I'm trying to believe you but
does Tim think we're bad people?

734
00:37:52,033 --> 00:37:54,300
Do you think we're bad people?

735
00:37:54,302 --> 00:37:56,369
That's rich coming from
the Edwards family.

736
00:37:56,371 --> 00:37:57,770
Excuse me, Lewis?

737
00:37:57,772 --> 00:37:59,639
What is that supposed to mean?

738
00:37:59,641 --> 00:38:01,591
What do you think it means?

739
00:38:01,592 --> 00:38:03,542
Lewis, can we please just
discuss this upstairs?

740
00:38:03,544 --> 00:38:05,678
Do you have something
against my family?

741
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,680
Oh, where to start?

742
00:38:07,682 --> 00:38:10,783
You let your teenage
daughter date a grown man.

743
00:38:10,785 --> 00:38:12,685
You leave trash
all over your lawn

744
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:15,554
and you're enabling your
son to become an alcoholic

745
00:38:15,556 --> 00:38:17,356
just like his father.

746
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:19,392
And you're one to talk!

747
00:38:19,394 --> 00:38:22,461
Don't think I don't know how
much you spend on webcam models.

748
00:38:22,463 --> 00:38:23,763
What was it last month, Alice?

749
00:38:23,765 --> 00:38:25,564
Four thousand dollars?

750
00:38:25,566 --> 00:38:28,801
Five hundred dollars for
just a pair of used panties.

751
00:38:28,803 --> 00:38:30,936
You told her about that?

752
00:38:30,938 --> 00:38:32,972
That was a secret, Melanie!

753
00:38:32,974 --> 00:38:35,325
I told you that in confidence!

754
00:38:35,326 --> 00:38:37,677
Well I guess it's all
out in the open, now!

755
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:39,979
And to think, me and my
low-class family spent

756
00:38:39,981 --> 00:38:41,947
Christmas with you last year.

757
00:38:41,949 --> 00:38:44,317
How ashamed you must have been.

758
00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:46,819
What you must think of me
to believe for one second

759
00:38:46,821 --> 00:38:49,755
that I was planning to
use that knife on you!

760
00:38:52,593 --> 00:38:56,329
Look Alice, this is stupid.

761
00:38:56,331 --> 00:38:57,430
How long have we
known each other?

762
00:38:57,432 --> 00:38:58,431
Ten years?

763
00:38:58,433 --> 00:39:00,199
Do not touch her!

764
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,966
All we know is that we received
a letter saying you would try to

765
00:39:01,969 --> 00:39:04,370
kill Alice and then
you show up at our home

766
00:39:04,372 --> 00:39:06,405
with a ten inch blade!

767
00:39:06,407 --> 00:39:07,773
You will not lay another
hand on me, Lewis.

768
00:39:07,775 --> 00:39:10,076
You got that?

769
00:39:10,077 --> 00:39:12,378
Then you will keep your
distance from my wife.

770
00:39:15,116 --> 00:39:16,582
This has been a crazy day

771
00:39:16,584 --> 00:39:18,951
and clearly coming
here was a bad idea.

772
00:39:18,953 --> 00:39:21,120
So I'm just going to
get my things and go.

773
00:39:21,122 --> 00:39:23,423
You're not going anywhere.

774
00:39:23,424 --> 00:39:25,725
You are gonna stay right here
until the authorities arrive.

775
00:39:25,727 --> 00:39:28,894
Alice, are you really going
to let him behave this way?

776
00:39:28,896 --> 00:39:30,596
Are you going to let
him treat me this way?

777
00:39:30,598 --> 00:39:33,999
Look Mel, just do
what Lewis says.

778
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,539
Alice, stop her,
she's going for the knife!

779
00:39:40,541 --> 00:39:43,042
Alice, please.

780
00:39:43,044 --> 00:39:45,778
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

781
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,046
My children are calling me.

782
00:39:47,048 --> 00:39:49,915
They need me, Tim needs me!

783
00:39:49,917 --> 00:39:52,385
I just want to answer my phone.

784
00:39:52,387 --> 00:39:53,486
I'm sorry.

785
00:39:55,656 --> 00:39:57,523
This is fucking crazy!

786
00:39:57,525 --> 00:40:02,695
Lewis, I'm sure we can work this
out, just put down the knife!

787
00:40:02,697 --> 00:40:05,664
The only solution I can think of
is to lock you in the basement

788
00:40:05,666 --> 00:40:07,032
until the police arrive.

789
00:40:07,034 --> 00:40:09,034
My children need me!

790
00:40:09,036 --> 00:40:11,504
That doesn't
concern me, Melanie.

791
00:40:11,506 --> 00:40:15,508
What matters to me is
the safety of my family.

792
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,609
Shhhh.

793
00:40:16,611 --> 00:40:17,676
It's OK.

794
00:40:17,678 --> 00:40:19,512
So, the choice is yours.

795
00:40:19,514 --> 00:40:21,814
You go down by
your own free will,

796
00:40:21,816 --> 00:40:23,115
or by force.

797
00:40:23,117 --> 00:40:25,985
But let's get
one thing straight,

798
00:40:25,987 --> 00:40:30,623
you are not leaving this
house until the police arrive.

799
00:40:30,625 --> 00:40:32,825
Lewis, I know that you are just

800
00:40:32,827 --> 00:40:35,628
trying to protect
your family right now,

801
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:39,598
but I am telling you one thing,
in all seriousness right now,

802
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,435
if you don't put down that
fucking knife and let me get

803
00:40:42,437 --> 00:40:45,971
to my phone, we are going
to have a problem here.

804
00:40:45,973 --> 00:40:47,440
Just try me, bitch.

805
00:40:50,111 --> 00:40:51,210
God.

806
00:40:54,816 --> 00:40:55,948
Alice.

807
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,850
Take the baby upstairs, now!

808
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:04,089
You shouldn't have done that.

809
00:41:23,711 --> 00:41:26,679
Mother, what the?

810
00:41:26,681 --> 00:41:28,714
I'm so sorry, Alice.

811
00:41:28,716 --> 00:41:30,149
I'm so sorry.

812
00:41:30,151 --> 00:41:32,218
Oh God, I'm so sorry!

813
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:35,654
I'm so sorry.

814
00:41:35,656 --> 00:41:37,156
You killed my husband!

815
00:41:37,158 --> 00:41:39,758
What have you done?

816
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,127
You killed my husband!

817
00:41:42,129 --> 00:41:43,896
I'm sorry, Alice.

818
00:41:43,898 --> 00:41:46,165
He was just trying
to protect me!

819
00:41:50,271 --> 00:41:52,872
Tim, Honey are you there?

820
00:41:52,874 --> 00:41:53,906
It's OK, Honey!

821
00:41:53,908 --> 00:41:55,007
It's OK, OK?

822
00:41:55,009 --> 00:41:56,609
I'll be there soon!

823
00:41:56,611 --> 00:41:58,711
Is your sister with you?

824
00:41:58,713 --> 00:42:01,614
OK good, that's good Tim,
that was smart.

825
00:42:01,616 --> 00:42:03,282
OK, now I need
you to go upstairs

826
00:42:03,284 --> 00:42:05,618
and hide with your sister.

827
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,886
Can you do that for me, Tim?

828
00:42:06,888 --> 00:42:08,220
Can you hide with Maddie?

829
00:42:08,222 --> 00:42:09,688
OK.

830
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:10,923
Gerry!

831
00:42:10,925 --> 00:42:13,058
You want some?

832
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,927
Come and get it you faggot!

833
00:42:18,766 --> 00:42:20,900
I don't know what
that sound is, Tim,

834
00:42:20,902 --> 00:42:22,268
but I need to hang up now, OK?

835
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:23,302
I'll be there soon.

836
00:42:23,304 --> 00:42:24,603
You fucks.

837
00:42:24,605 --> 00:42:25,671
No one fucks with me.

838
00:42:25,673 --> 00:42:26,805
No one fucks with me.

839
00:42:26,807 --> 00:42:29,008
I'll be there soon.

840
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:30,776
No one fucks with me!

841
00:42:37,184 --> 00:42:38,851
You fucks.

842
00:42:38,853 --> 00:42:39,985
No one fucks with me.

843
00:42:39,987 --> 00:42:41,654
No one fucks with me!

844
00:42:54,068 --> 00:42:55,801
Why would you try
something like that, bitch?

845
00:42:55,803 --> 00:42:57,670
Why would you try
something like that, bitch?

846
00:42:57,672 --> 00:42:59,104
I knew you were the one
that really wanted me dead!

847
00:42:59,106 --> 00:43:00,973
That letter was
just a fucking excuse.

848
00:43:00,975 --> 00:43:02,808
I can't be the only one
who wants to see you dead.

849
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:04,677
Fuck you!

850
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:06,111
What the fuck was that?

851
00:44:20,655 --> 00:44:22,755
You better run, Boy.

852
00:44:30,297 --> 00:44:32,931
Where are you running to?

853
00:44:32,933 --> 00:44:34,933
Like a little girl.

854
00:44:34,935 --> 00:44:36,001
Please, you don't
need to do this!

855
00:44:36,003 --> 00:44:37,936
You don't have to do this!

856
00:44:43,377 --> 00:44:44,677
Please!

857
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:46,045
Please, I don't
want to fucking die!

858
00:44:46,047 --> 00:44:48,915
Please!

859
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:51,784
Didn't anyone teach you
millennials how to fight?

860
00:44:56,991 --> 00:44:58,057
Please, you don't
have to do this!

861
00:44:58,059 --> 00:44:59,792
Please, you don't
have to do this!

862
00:44:59,794 --> 00:45:03,128
No, I don't have to.

863
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:05,197
But I want to.

864
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:06,398
Please!

865
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,466
Please!

866
00:45:07,468 --> 00:45:09,134
Please, I don't want to die!

867
00:45:09,136 --> 00:45:11,136
Please, please.

868
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:17,309
Mom?

869
00:45:17,311 --> 00:45:19,244
Mom, Mom, Mom.

870
00:45:20,281 --> 00:45:23,082
Mom, Mom.

871
00:45:23,084 --> 00:45:24,416
Please stop!

872
00:45:24,418 --> 00:45:26,885
Stop, please stop!

873
00:45:26,887 --> 00:45:30,089
Come on, please.

874
00:45:30,091 --> 00:45:32,391
Please, don't kill her,
please stop!

875
00:45:34,829 --> 00:45:36,495
Please, please stop.

876
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,866
You.

877
00:45:40,868 --> 00:45:42,000
Fucking.

878
00:45:42,002 --> 00:45:43,102
Cunt.

879
00:45:43,104 --> 00:45:44,236
Please stop.

880
00:45:48,976 --> 00:45:50,375
Honey, are you OK?

881
00:45:50,377 --> 00:45:51,510
You shouldn't have left us, Mom.

882
00:45:51,512 --> 00:45:52,978
I know, I know, I'm sorry.

883
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:55,247
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

884
00:45:55,249 --> 00:45:58,117
Are you OK?

885
00:45:58,119 --> 00:45:59,785
Oh, my God!

886
00:45:59,787 --> 00:46:01,520
Oh, God, we need to
get you to a hospital!

887
00:46:01,522 --> 00:46:02,855
Mom, you're covered in blood!

888
00:46:02,857 --> 00:46:03,989
What happened at Alice's?

889
00:46:03,991 --> 00:46:05,124
I'm fine, it's OK.

890
00:46:05,126 --> 00:46:06,158
We need to get out of here.

891
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,226
Where is your sister?

892
00:46:07,228 --> 00:46:08,360
She's upstairs, In the bathroom.

893
00:46:08,362 --> 00:46:09,394
OK good.

894
00:46:09,396 --> 00:46:10,529
Good, you did good, Tim.

895
00:46:10,531 --> 00:46:12,998
You did so so good.

896
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,199
Is he dead?

897
00:46:19,774 --> 00:46:21,240
Yes.

898
00:46:21,242 --> 00:46:23,008
OK.

899
00:46:23,010 --> 00:46:24,343
I need you to stay here.

900
00:46:24,345 --> 00:46:27,312
I'm gonna go get Maddie
and I'll be right back, OK?

901
00:46:27,314 --> 00:46:28,847
It's OK.

902
00:46:28,849 --> 00:46:30,983
I'll be right back.

903
00:46:42,029 --> 00:46:43,195
Maddie!

904
00:46:43,197 --> 00:46:46,498
Maddie, it's time to go!

905
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,267
It's safe now!

906
00:46:48,268 --> 00:46:50,035
We need to get your
brother to the hospital!

907
00:46:50,037 --> 00:46:51,170
Maddie?

908
00:46:51,172 --> 00:46:52,237
Are you in there?

909
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:53,305
Open up!

910
00:46:53,307 --> 00:46:55,040
It's time to go!

911
00:46:55,042 --> 00:46:56,208
Maddie?

912
00:47:01,515 --> 00:47:02,915
Maddie?

913
00:47:02,917 --> 00:47:04,049
Maddie?

914
00:47:04,051 --> 00:47:05,584
Where are you, Maddie?

915
00:47:05,586 --> 00:47:08,086
Fuck.

916
00:47:08,088 --> 00:47:13,025
Oh, my God.

917
00:47:13,027 --> 00:47:14,827
Oh, God.

918
00:47:20,367 --> 00:47:22,935
What the fuck are you gonna do?

919
00:47:44,391 --> 00:47:47,893
Oh, you stupid girl.

920
00:47:47,895 --> 00:47:49,161
Maddie?

921
00:47:49,163 --> 00:47:51,630
Maddie!

922
00:47:57,938 --> 00:47:59,137
Madison!

923
00:47:59,139 --> 00:48:01,506
You call me back as soon
as you get this, OK?

924
00:48:01,508 --> 00:48:04,276
Maddie, I hope you're OK.

925
00:48:07,047 --> 00:48:08,413
Where's Maddie?

926
00:48:08,415 --> 00:48:10,883
Let's see your hand.

927
00:48:10,885 --> 00:48:12,184
Where's Maddie?

928
00:48:13,487 --> 00:48:14,653
I don't know.

929
00:48:14,655 --> 00:48:17,990
I think she's at Luther's.

930
00:48:17,992 --> 00:48:19,191
Why would she leave the house?

931
00:48:19,193 --> 00:48:20,259
I don't know.

932
00:48:20,261 --> 00:48:22,928
I just, I don't know Tim,

933
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:24,596
but we need to
get out of here, OK?

934
00:48:26,934 --> 00:48:29,334
Here, I need you to take these.

935
00:48:29,336 --> 00:48:30,402
What are they?

936
00:48:30,404 --> 00:48:32,337
They're leftover T3s.

937
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:35,908
They'll take your pain away, OK?

938
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:38,310
You'll start to
feel better soon, OK?

939
00:48:41,282 --> 00:48:43,415
What about my leg?

940
00:48:43,417 --> 00:48:44,583
I don't think I
should touch that.

941
00:48:44,585 --> 00:48:46,551
I think I'll just make it worse.

942
00:48:48,622 --> 00:48:50,088
OK.

943
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:52,391
Now, this is going
to hurt for a second.

944
00:48:52,393 --> 00:48:55,260
It's going to hurt real bad, OK?

945
00:48:55,262 --> 00:48:56,695
And then as soon as
we get your sister,

946
00:48:56,697 --> 00:48:59,298
then we're gonna get you
right to the hospital.

947
00:49:02,202 --> 00:49:04,436
You are very brave,
do you know that?

948
00:49:09,443 --> 00:49:10,976
OK, let's do this.

949
00:49:10,978 --> 00:49:12,210
Come on.

950
00:49:13,614 --> 00:49:15,447
OK, get your foot under you.

951
00:49:15,449 --> 00:49:16,615
We're going to
count to three, ready?

952
00:49:16,617 --> 00:49:17,716
1.

953
00:49:17,718 --> 00:49:18,951
2.

954
00:49:18,953 --> 00:49:20,085
3!

955
00:49:20,087 --> 00:49:21,687
Good, good, good,
OK, you got this.

956
00:49:21,689 --> 00:49:23,055
I've got you.

957
00:49:23,057 --> 00:49:24,456
You're OK.

958
00:49:26,193 --> 00:49:27,326
You're OK.

959
00:49:27,328 --> 00:49:29,428
You're OK, I've got you.

960
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:30,662
We're almost there.

961
00:49:30,664 --> 00:49:31,964
Almost there.

962
00:49:31,966 --> 00:49:33,231
I got you.

963
00:49:34,468 --> 00:49:35,734
Let's go.

964
00:49:38,238 --> 00:49:41,340
We hope you have
all been enjoying today's festivities.

965
00:49:41,342 --> 00:49:44,609
One thing has become apparent
during this revolution of ours.

966
00:49:44,611 --> 00:49:46,378
Only the strong will survive.

967
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:49,014
With this in mind, your friends
at The Unknown have arranged

968
00:49:49,016 --> 00:49:51,083
a game of death for
your entertainment.

969
00:49:51,085 --> 00:49:52,617
Enjoy.

970
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:54,339
Thank you for
calling Emergency Services.

971
00:51:54,341 --> 00:51:57,642
We are currently experiencing a
higher than normal call volume

972
00:51:57,644 --> 00:51:59,611
and have put you in a queue.

973
00:51:59,613 --> 00:52:00,879
You are currently

974
00:52:00,881 --> 00:52:03,381
sixteenth in line.

975
00:52:03,383 --> 00:52:05,617
Your estimated wait time is

976
00:52:05,619 --> 00:52:06,751
eleven minutes.

977
00:52:06,753 --> 00:52:09,354
Fuck!

978
00:52:09,356 --> 00:52:11,389
You should just try again.

979
00:52:13,727 --> 00:52:16,228
Mom, try again, I mean maybe it
was just down for a moment.

980
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:17,496
Quiet Tim!

981
00:52:17,498 --> 00:52:19,764
I just need a
second to think, OK?

982
00:52:29,576 --> 00:52:31,676
People of Aspen Ridge.

983
00:52:31,677 --> 00:52:33,777
We at the Lakeview Lutheran
Church are taking a group of

984
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:36,181
injured people to the hospital.

985
00:52:36,183 --> 00:52:37,782
If you need help, come quickly.

986
00:52:37,784 --> 00:52:39,784
Just wait here, OK?

987
00:52:39,785 --> 00:52:41,785
We will be back to offer
more aid later this afternoon.

988
00:52:41,788 --> 00:52:44,589
Please.

989
00:52:44,591 --> 00:52:45,657
Can we help you?

990
00:52:45,659 --> 00:52:46,792
Please, I need your help!

991
00:52:46,793 --> 00:52:47,926
My son, he needs to
go to the hospital

992
00:52:47,928 --> 00:52:49,828
and I need to find my daughter!

993
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:50,929
We can help.

994
00:52:50,931 --> 00:52:52,564
We have room for two more souls.

995
00:52:52,566 --> 00:52:53,665
Thank you!

996
00:52:53,667 --> 00:52:55,800
Thank you so much.

997
00:52:55,802 --> 00:52:57,536
You're good people.

998
00:52:57,538 --> 00:52:58,937
Where will you take him?

999
00:52:58,939 --> 00:53:01,573
Holy Cross and we'll
have your son call

1000
00:53:01,575 --> 00:53:02,941
as soon as we deliver him.

1001
00:53:02,943 --> 00:53:04,676
And we can have someone
help you get him out of the car

1002
00:53:04,678 --> 00:53:06,278
in just a moment.

1003
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,746
Thank you.

1004
00:53:07,748 --> 00:53:09,581
We're not very religious people,

1005
00:53:09,582 --> 00:53:11,415
we're more spiritual but if we
could donate to your church

1006
00:53:11,418 --> 00:53:13,885
or maybe volunteer at an
event you're having.

1007
00:53:13,887 --> 00:53:17,856
Aiding people in a time
of need is its own reward.

1008
00:53:17,858 --> 00:53:19,558
If you want to just
wait with your son a moment

1009
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:22,961
while we make room
for this gentleman.

1010
00:53:24,932 --> 00:53:26,331
You could have killed him!

1011
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:27,566
You almost killed him!

1012
00:53:27,568 --> 00:53:29,968
What is she talking about Ma'am?

1013
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:31,203
Ma'am?

1014
00:53:31,205 --> 00:53:32,304
She did it!

1015
00:53:32,306 --> 00:53:33,822
She stabbed Lewis!

1016
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:35,339
What is she talking about Ma'am?

1017
00:53:35,342 --> 00:53:37,509
Ma'am?

1018
00:53:37,511 --> 00:53:39,778
You almost killed him!

1019
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,780
Somebody do something!

1020
00:53:41,782 --> 00:53:43,515
Ma'am, get back here right now!

1021
00:53:43,517 --> 00:53:44,583
She did it!

1022
00:53:44,585 --> 00:53:45,984
She stabbed Lewis!

1023
00:53:45,986 --> 00:53:49,521
Somebody do something!

1024
00:53:49,523 --> 00:53:51,790
Stop Mom, who are these people?

1025
00:53:51,792 --> 00:53:53,658
Mom, stop, that's Alice!

1026
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:54,993
No!

1027
00:53:58,532 --> 00:54:02,267
License plate EWR-032.

1028
00:54:02,269 --> 00:54:03,335
Echo.

1029
00:54:03,337 --> 00:54:04,402
Whiskey.

1030
00:54:04,404 --> 00:54:05,470
Romeo.

1031
00:54:05,472 --> 00:54:06,771
She assaulted this poor man!

1032
00:54:08,942 --> 00:54:10,675
You shouldn't have put
that knife in my purse, Tim.

1033
00:54:10,677 --> 00:54:12,611
You shouldn't have done that.

1034
00:54:12,613 --> 00:54:14,512
Why is this happening?

1035
00:54:14,514 --> 00:54:16,014
We have to deal with
all of that later, OK?

1036
00:54:16,016 --> 00:54:18,433
We just need to get Maddie.

1037
00:54:18,434 --> 00:54:20,851
I think Luther's house is
just around the corner.

1038
00:54:20,854 --> 00:54:23,388
I can't believe this.

1039
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:24,823
I can't believe any of this.

1040
00:54:24,825 --> 00:54:26,558
We'll get through this, OK?

1041
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,527
We just need to push on.

1042
00:54:42,276 --> 00:54:43,908
This is it.

1043
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:46,344
This is Lucifer.

1044
00:54:46,346 --> 00:54:47,545
Luther's place.

1045
00:54:54,354 --> 00:54:57,389
I think I'm pretty
high from these pills.

1046
00:54:57,391 --> 00:54:58,790
Yeah.

1047
00:54:58,792 --> 00:55:00,659
Sorry about that.

1048
00:55:00,661 --> 00:55:03,061
Two likely would
have done the trick.

1049
00:55:03,063 --> 00:55:04,529
Are you still in pain, though?

1050
00:55:04,531 --> 00:55:05,597
No.

1051
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:08,400
I feel like one big puffy cloud.

1052
00:55:14,541 --> 00:55:17,042
What's this for?

1053
00:55:17,043 --> 00:55:19,544
In case you need to defend
yourself while I'm in there.

1054
00:55:19,546 --> 00:55:21,946
Not sure what I'd do with this
considering I couldn't find

1055
00:55:21,948 --> 00:55:24,582
a use for a meat tenderizer.

1056
00:55:24,584 --> 00:55:25,817
I think you did pretty good.

1057
00:55:32,693 --> 00:55:34,426
Did I kill him?

1058
00:55:34,428 --> 00:55:36,094
No Honey,

1059
00:55:36,096 --> 00:55:38,463
no, I did.

1060
00:55:38,465 --> 00:55:42,334
You just, you saved my life.

1061
00:55:42,336 --> 00:55:44,002
Mom, what if you
don't come back?

1062
00:55:44,004 --> 00:55:46,705
Well, then you call
your Auntie Heather, OK?

1063
00:55:46,707 --> 00:55:48,973
She'll take care of you.

1064
00:55:48,975 --> 00:55:50,608
But what if you die in there?

1065
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:52,577
No, Tim!

1066
00:55:52,579 --> 00:55:55,113
We can't think like that, OK?

1067
00:55:55,115 --> 00:55:56,748
- But-
- No, OK?

1068
00:56:01,021 --> 00:56:04,556
Do you remember

1069
00:56:04,558 --> 00:56:06,491
that road trip we took

1070
00:56:06,493 --> 00:56:07,992
to Grandma Nancy's
when you were young?

1071
00:56:07,994 --> 00:56:09,127
You were little.

1072
00:56:09,129 --> 00:56:10,628
You were just five.

1073
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:12,063
Maddie would have been seven.

1074
00:56:12,065 --> 00:56:13,832
It was our first time ever
going through the mountains

1075
00:56:13,834 --> 00:56:16,067
with you kids.

1076
00:56:16,069 --> 00:56:17,702
You kept making
us stop everywhere

1077
00:56:17,704 --> 00:56:18,803
so you could pick rocks.

1078
00:56:18,805 --> 00:56:20,422
Do you remember that?

1079
00:56:20,423 --> 00:56:22,040
You guys must have
had ten pounds of rocks

1080
00:56:22,042 --> 00:56:23,942
back there with you.

1081
00:56:26,146 --> 00:56:28,413
Do you remember
what happened next?

1082
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,481
No.

1083
00:56:29,483 --> 00:56:30,882
Not really.

1084
00:56:30,884 --> 00:56:33,485
We were just in
the middle of nowhere.

1085
00:56:33,487 --> 00:56:36,788
It started to rain
and it was dark.

1086
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:38,757
So dark.

1087
00:56:38,759 --> 00:56:40,158
That kind of dark you only get

1088
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,161
when you're miles
away from anything.

1089
00:56:45,932 --> 00:56:51,469
We rounded this corner and we
saw all these flashing lights.

1090
00:56:51,471 --> 00:56:54,939
So, we pulled over to see what
was going on and as we rolled

1091
00:56:54,941 --> 00:57:01,079
down the windows you could
hear this horrible moaning

1092
00:57:01,081 --> 00:57:04,082
and this woman crying.

1093
00:57:04,084 --> 00:57:07,919
And then you saw it first but

1094
00:57:07,921 --> 00:57:10,622
we realized there was this
deer that had crashed through

1095
00:57:10,624 --> 00:57:16,461
the windshield and was pinning
the woman to her seat.

1096
00:57:16,463 --> 00:57:19,063
You jumped out of the car and
Maddie followed and I just had

1097
00:57:19,065 --> 00:57:22,801
to console you two while your
dad helped the woman out.

1098
00:57:22,803 --> 00:57:27,672
And we stayed with her
as she waited for help

1099
00:57:27,674 --> 00:57:31,709
and the whole time that deer

1100
00:57:31,711 --> 00:57:34,813
was just making the
most horrible noise.

1101
00:57:34,815 --> 00:57:39,150
This moan, it just echoed.

1102
00:57:39,152 --> 00:57:41,453
And you kids were
just begging us,

1103
00:57:41,455 --> 00:57:44,222
begging us to do something,

1104
00:57:44,224 --> 00:57:49,894
and there was just nothing
that we could do, you know?

1105
00:57:49,896 --> 00:57:52,730
Your Dad and I were just trying
to tell you that it was the

1106
00:57:52,732 --> 00:57:57,135
deer's time to pass

1107
00:57:57,137 --> 00:58:02,874
and then the deer,
it got like a second wind

1108
00:58:02,876 --> 00:58:06,110
it just started
like kicking madly.

1109
00:58:06,112 --> 00:58:08,913
It kicked so hard and
it like lifted itself up,

1110
00:58:08,915 --> 00:58:10,815
right out of the windshield

1111
00:58:10,817 --> 00:58:15,687
and then just bounded
off into the woods.

1112
00:58:15,689 --> 00:58:18,890
We were all watching it run away

1113
00:58:18,892 --> 00:58:21,726
when Maddie-

1114
00:58:21,728 --> 00:58:23,261
Maddie said something
I'll never forget.

1115
00:58:23,263 --> 00:58:26,631
She said-

1116
00:58:26,633 --> 00:58:29,267
"Good creatures
don't die so easy."

1117
00:58:35,008 --> 00:58:38,142
So, you're the good creature?

1118
00:58:38,144 --> 00:58:41,045
I hope so, Tim.

1119
00:58:41,047 --> 00:58:42,614
I hope so.

1120
00:58:51,024 --> 00:58:52,891
OK.

1121
00:58:55,662 --> 00:58:56,761
Wish me luck.

1122
00:58:56,763 --> 00:58:57,795
Good luck.

1123
00:59:52,819 --> 00:59:55,119
Shhhhh!

1124
00:59:55,121 --> 00:59:56,220
I am not here to hurt you, OK?

1125
00:59:56,222 --> 00:59:57,255
I'm not here to hurt you.

1126
00:59:57,257 --> 00:59:58,823
Then why, why are you here?

1127
00:59:58,825 --> 00:59:59,958
My daughter Maddie.

1128
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:03,294
Madison Edwards, is she here?

1129
01:00:03,296 --> 01:00:05,863
Madison, she's in the basement.

1130
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:08,299
Did he do this to you?

1131
01:00:08,301 --> 01:00:10,001
Yes he did!

1132
01:00:12,005 --> 01:00:13,237
Has he hurt Maddie?

1133
01:00:13,239 --> 01:00:14,906
Has he hurt my daughter?

1134
01:00:14,908 --> 01:00:16,107
I don't know.

1135
01:00:16,109 --> 01:00:18,176
I heard screaming.

1136
01:00:18,178 --> 01:00:19,711
He just made a mistake.

1137
01:00:19,713 --> 01:00:20,778
He's young.

1138
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:22,847
Please, please
don't hurt my son.

1139
01:01:56,076 --> 01:01:57,809
OK.

1140
01:02:00,413 --> 01:02:05,483
Welcome ladies and gentlemen
to the inaugural Red Letter Day

1141
01:02:05,485 --> 01:02:09,153
presented to you by your
friends at The Unknown.

1142
01:02:09,155 --> 01:02:12,490
I have a very special treat
for you lucky viewers.

1143
01:02:12,492 --> 01:02:16,227
I'm your host
with the most, Kyrpto,

1144
01:02:16,229 --> 01:02:17,962
and for those of you
who haven't heard my name

1145
01:02:17,964 --> 01:02:21,999
believe me,
after today you will,

1146
01:02:22,001 --> 01:02:25,369
because you are about to
bear witness to the first ever

1147
01:02:25,371 --> 01:02:28,973
live-streamed
Red Letter Day death.

1148
01:02:28,975 --> 01:02:30,508
Lucky, lucky.

1149
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:31,843
The fuck?

1150
01:02:32,812 --> 01:02:34,112
OK, OK, down, down.

1151
01:02:34,114 --> 01:02:35,513
It's gone, Luther, it's gone.

1152
01:02:35,515 --> 01:02:37,949
Just put the gun
down, Luther, please.

1153
01:02:37,951 --> 01:02:39,984
Doesn't this makes things
a little more interesting.

1154
01:02:39,986 --> 01:02:41,619
It's going to be
OK, just stay calm.

1155
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:43,253
How do you feel about me killing
someone who was inside you?

1156
01:02:43,256 --> 01:02:45,056
Luther, please,
you don't need to do this,

1157
01:02:45,058 --> 01:02:46,124
just put the gun down.

1158
01:02:46,126 --> 01:02:47,191
Shut the fuck up!

1159
01:02:47,193 --> 01:02:48,259
Shut the fuck up!

1160
01:02:48,261 --> 01:02:49,327
I know.

1161
01:02:49,329 --> 01:02:50,394
Let's ask the people.

1162
01:02:50,396 --> 01:02:51,529
This is a democracy after all.

1163
01:02:51,531 --> 01:02:52,530
Right babe?

1164
01:02:52,532 --> 01:02:54,766
What do you say, cyberspace?

1165
01:02:54,768 --> 01:02:57,001
Should I kill both of
these lovely ladies?

1166
01:02:57,003 --> 01:02:59,003
Holy fuck,
look at those numbers.

1167
01:02:59,005 --> 01:03:00,471
I guess that settles it.

1168
01:03:00,473 --> 01:03:02,406
Shut the fuck up!

1169
01:03:02,408 --> 01:03:05,276
Looks like we've got
ourselves a double whammy!

1170
01:03:05,278 --> 01:03:06,778
Why are you doing this, why?

1171
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:08,246
I'm not doing this, we all are.

1172
01:03:08,248 --> 01:03:10,448
Look at you, I see
the fucking blood on you.

1173
01:03:10,450 --> 01:03:12,283
This is a fucking
revolution lady,

1174
01:03:12,285 --> 01:03:14,018
and we all know revolution
can't happen without

1175
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:16,220
people's hands getting
a little fucking dirty.

1176
01:03:16,222 --> 01:03:18,422
I've got a feeling this scene,

1177
01:03:18,424 --> 01:03:22,426
this fucking scene is
gonna be quite popular.

1178
01:03:22,428 --> 01:03:26,197
Now, stop!

1179
01:03:26,199 --> 01:03:27,632
I don't have another
pair of handcuffs

1180
01:03:27,633 --> 01:03:29,066
so if you don't mind,
I'm gonna kill you right now.

1181
01:03:29,068 --> 01:03:31,068
Please, no, please!

1182
01:03:33,173 --> 01:03:35,206
No, no, no!

1183
01:03:38,311 --> 01:03:42,146
Oh fuck, this is so easy.

1184
01:03:42,148 --> 01:03:43,548
I don't know,
I can't shoot both of you,

1185
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:45,590
that seems kind of fucking
cheap, what do you think?

1186
01:03:48,588 --> 01:03:51,355
I know, let's ask
the viewers to help us

1187
01:03:51,357 --> 01:03:53,524
pick something a
little more interesting.

1188
01:03:53,526 --> 01:03:54,959
Hey babe?

1189
01:03:56,029 --> 01:03:57,528
Help us folks.

1190
01:03:57,530 --> 01:04:01,866
We've got death by blade,

1191
01:04:01,868 --> 01:04:03,835
ahhhhh,

1192
01:04:03,837 --> 01:04:06,504
death by fucking strangulation,

1193
01:04:06,506 --> 01:04:08,072
no, fuck that, that's stupid.

1194
01:04:09,409 --> 01:04:11,576
I know, let's have a,

1195
01:04:11,578 --> 01:04:14,212
a mother/daughter
game of Russian Roulette.

1196
01:04:14,214 --> 01:04:15,613
Fuck, that's good.

1197
01:04:22,222 --> 01:04:25,623
Ahhhhh!

1198
01:04:27,627 --> 01:04:29,527
Holy fuck, I need a doctor.

1199
01:04:29,529 --> 01:04:31,996
You were gonna kill my child.

1200
01:04:31,998 --> 01:04:33,631
Live on the internet?

1201
01:04:33,633 --> 01:04:36,234
Well, no, I wasn't.

1202
01:04:38,605 --> 01:04:39,971
It's OK baby, it's OK.

1203
01:04:39,973 --> 01:04:41,138
This will all be over soon.

1204
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:42,473
Mom.

1205
01:04:42,475 --> 01:04:45,142
Ahhhhhh.

1206
01:04:45,144 --> 01:04:46,244
Oh shit.

1207
01:04:46,246 --> 01:04:48,145
How many people
are watching this?

1208
01:04:50,884 --> 01:04:53,435
Two million.

1209
01:04:53,436 --> 01:04:55,987
Two million people were gonna
watch you kill my daughter?

1210
01:04:55,989 --> 01:04:59,056
You were gonna watch
him slaughter my child?

1211
01:04:59,058 --> 01:05:00,424
Why?

1212
01:05:00,426 --> 01:05:03,261
Why would you wanna see this?

1213
01:05:03,263 --> 01:05:05,529
Mom, I just wanna go home.

1214
01:05:05,531 --> 01:05:07,031
Please just take me home.

1215
01:05:07,033 --> 01:05:08,132
Soon, Baby.

1216
01:05:08,134 --> 01:05:09,233
She was gonna call the cops!

1217
01:05:09,235 --> 01:05:10,635
She was gonna tell
them everything!

1218
01:05:10,637 --> 01:05:13,537
You were going to kill my baby!

1219
01:05:13,539 --> 01:05:14,939
Put the gun down Mom.

1220
01:05:14,941 --> 01:05:17,174
What were you thinking?

1221
01:05:17,176 --> 01:05:18,276
Mom, please!

1222
01:05:18,278 --> 01:05:20,177
Why were you doing this?

1223
01:05:20,179 --> 01:05:23,681
You filled people with paranoia.

1224
01:05:23,683 --> 01:05:25,216
You caused them to kill.

1225
01:05:25,218 --> 01:05:28,319
You caused good
people to murder!

1226
01:05:28,321 --> 01:05:31,455
We just sent the letters,
you did the rest.

1227
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,193
Please don't, no.

1228
01:05:45,038 --> 01:05:47,371
Now, get up.

1229
01:05:50,343 --> 01:05:52,476
Give me the key
to her handcuffs.

1230
01:05:57,183 --> 01:05:59,317
You're not going to kill me?

1231
01:05:59,319 --> 01:06:02,219
And give those
sickos the satisfaction?

1232
01:06:03,623 --> 01:06:06,057
You are not lucky
enough to die today.

1233
01:06:12,098 --> 01:06:13,597
Asshole.

1234
01:06:19,205 --> 01:06:21,339
Pick yourself up.

1235
01:06:27,647 --> 01:06:30,614
You tell me everything
you know about this shit.

1236
01:06:30,616 --> 01:06:33,250
I can't.

1237
01:06:34,354 --> 01:06:36,520
I can't, the
Unknown will kill me.

1238
01:06:36,522 --> 01:06:41,025
Do I look like I give a
fuck about The Unknown?

1239
01:06:41,027 --> 01:06:42,360
Now start talking.

1240
01:07:28,541 --> 01:07:30,374
What's the ice scraper for?

1241
01:07:30,376 --> 01:07:33,544
To punish older sisters who
try and sneak out of the house.

1242
01:07:35,681 --> 01:07:38,115
Are you OK?

1243
01:07:38,117 --> 01:07:40,818
Yeah, other than a fucked up leg
and a lifetime of nightmares,

1244
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:42,420
I'm fine.

1245
01:07:42,422 --> 01:07:44,321
Oh my God!

1246
01:07:45,425 --> 01:07:47,224
It's pretty gross, hey?

1247
01:07:47,226 --> 01:07:48,526
Does that hurt?

1248
01:07:48,528 --> 01:07:50,261
No.

1249
01:07:50,263 --> 01:07:53,497
I'm pretty messed up on pills.

1250
01:07:56,069 --> 01:07:58,335
Are you OK?

1251
01:07:59,705 --> 01:08:02,473
Yeah, I think so.

1252
01:08:07,447 --> 01:08:11,182
I'm sorry.

1253
01:08:11,184 --> 01:08:13,751
I'm so sorry
for leaving you, Tim.

1254
01:08:13,753 --> 01:08:15,252
I know you are, Maddie.

1255
01:08:22,428 --> 01:08:23,828
It's OK.

1256
01:08:58,664 --> 01:09:01,398
What a fucking day.

1257
01:09:05,371 --> 01:09:08,239
Alright, buckle up.

1258
01:10:03,696 --> 01:10:06,830
We may have done
some bad things today,

1259
01:10:06,832 --> 01:10:09,433
but we're not bad people.

1260
01:10:09,435 --> 01:10:10,734
Remember that, OK?

1261
01:10:13,339 --> 01:10:15,472
We just did what we
had to do to survive,

1262
01:10:15,474 --> 01:10:16,574
and we came out alive,

1263
01:10:16,576 --> 01:10:18,309
not everyone was so lucky.

1264
01:10:19,378 --> 01:10:21,779
So, what do we do now?

1265
01:10:21,781 --> 01:10:24,148
I don't know,

1266
01:10:24,149 --> 01:10:26,516
but whatever it is,
we do it together, OK?

1267
01:10:28,487 --> 01:10:30,454
You got it?

1268
01:10:30,456 --> 01:10:32,590
Got it.

1269
01:10:32,592 --> 01:10:34,358
Got it.

1270
01:11:32,592 --> 01:11:34,358
