1
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,054
<i>Please welcome to the podium</i>

2
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:37,598
<i>the head coach and leader
of the Mighty Ducks,</i>

3
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:41,102
<i>Gordon Bombay.</i>

4
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:47,024
<i>Thank you.
It's a great honor to be here today</i>

5
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:49,568
<i>to introduce you
to a truly great group of kids.</i>

6
00:01:49,652 --> 00:01:51,821
<i>Sure, they can be
a little rambunctious.</i>

7
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:54,990
<i>They've run me ragged and played
more than their fair share of pranks.</i>

8
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:57,159
<i>I still haven't forgotten
about those eggs.</i>

9
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,496
<i>But I hung in there,
and they hung in there for me.</i>

10
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:05,084
<i>We became the Quack Attack,
the Flying "V" and the Bash Brothers.</i>

11
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,669
<i>I've never had a better time.</i>

12
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:10,923
<i>These kids are winners,
each and every one of them.</i>

13
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:12,925
<i>But more than that,
these are good people.</i>

14
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,052
<i>I hope that they enrich and enliven
your school and your lives</i>

15
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:16,637
<i>the way they have mine.</i>

16
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,931
<i>Now I hand you over
to the capable hands</i>

17
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:21,976
<i>of my old biology teacher
and the current headmaster</i>

18
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:23,769
<i>of Eden Hall, Dean Buckley.</i>

19
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:26,564
<i>Dean.</i>

20
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,818
<i>Gordon Bombay
has a lot to be proud of.</i>

21
00:02:31,402 --> 00:02:33,779
<i>We are happy to welcome the Ducks</i>

22
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:36,615
<i>to our great educational institution.</i>

23
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:39,535
So, today it gives me
great pleasure to award you

24
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,247
these full athletic scholarships
to the Eden Hall Academy...

25
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:51,505
where we hope the Ducks will be happy
Warriors and lead us on to glory

26
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:53,215
<i>and divisional championships.</i>

27
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,652
- Maybe I should tell him first.
- I think that's a good idea.

28
00:03:26,207 --> 00:03:29,251
The school looks stuffy,
but we'll loosen it up. Huh, Coach?

29
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:33,047
I'm not gonna be your coach
this year, Charlie.

30
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,716
Yeah, very funny.

31
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,219
I just got the official word.

32
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,848
The Junior Goodwill Games Committee
has named me Director of Player Personnel.

33
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:46,018
I'm gonna be in charge of
their junior hockey program worldwide.

34
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:47,770
Well, don't go.

35
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,439
Charlie, I can't pass up this opportunity.

36
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:53,192
But you can pass us up, right?

37
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:55,444
I mean, you dump us in some
stupid school and now...

38
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:58,155
I'm not dumping you anywhere.
Eden Hall is a great chance for you.

39
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,033
- Charlie, I will always...
- Coach, please...

40
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,330
don't go.

41
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:09,124
Charlie, I know it's hard.

42
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,377
- I understand what you're going thr...
- No, no.

43
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,254
No, you don't understand.

44
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:17,132
You obviously don't even have a clue.

45
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,627
You know, I think this place
is running very low

46
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:56,046
- on the brothers quotient.
- Yeah.

47
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,049
Hey, I want to know
who this new Coach Orion is.

48
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:01,260
My dad said that if I didn't like him,
I could come right home.

49
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:02,344
That's nice.

50
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:05,848
My dad said I better stay in
on scholarship or he'll whip my butt.

51
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,391
You know, I heard in the dorm

52
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,976
that the guy played
for the Minnesota North Stars

53
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,520
and got suspended
for punching out his own coach.

54
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:12,980
You mean the Dallas Stars.

55
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:15,983
- I heard he punched out a fan.
- I heard he was a Buddhist.

56
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:19,028
You know, like Kung Fu or Richard Gere.

57
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:21,196
Kung Fu wasn't a Buddhist.
He was a Trappist monk.

58
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,948
Are you talking about
the old <i>Kung Fu</i>

59
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:25,284
or the <i>Further Adventures
of the New Kung Fu?</i>

60
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:26,744
Y'all watch too much TV.

61
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,121
Shoot, that's the safest thing
to do in my hood.

62
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,500
Watch it, Mom.
You might get... hit.

63
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:36,462
Don't worry about me, Mom.

64
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,590
You're right.

65
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,926
As long as I have the Ducks, I should
be able to handle this new school.

66
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,887
That's my boy.

67
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,978
Hey, Fulton, you ever
think about shooting

68
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:55,230
back into the alley and not the street?

69
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:57,399
Not really.

70
00:06:03,197 --> 00:06:05,115
I just found out Portman isn't coming.

71
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,076
He's staying in Chicago.
How uncool is that?

72
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,119
No, you got to be kidding me.

73
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:11,288
He found out Bombay bailed,
and he bailed too.

74
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:13,123
Well...

75
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:15,000
What good is one Bash Brother?

76
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,920
I mean, what am I now, Mr. Bash?
The Bashman?

77
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:22,674
<i>Ow! Hey, watch it, please!</i>

78
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,678
- That hurt.
- <i>Sorry, Goldberg.</i>

79
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,889
Oh, no problem, guys.

80
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:32,643
Life isn't bad enough, I gotta worry
about being nailed off the ice too.

81
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,478
Why am I always getting shot at?

82
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,022
- You're a goalie, dude. Deal.
- Well put.

83
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:39,525
- Thanks, Fulton. Real sensitive.
- You're welcome.

84
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,193
Well, let's go.

85
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,654
We wouldn't want
to keep the preppy snobs waiting.

86
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:50,911
Hey, you know what?

87
00:06:51,412 --> 00:06:53,580
You Ducks don't belong here at Eden Hall.

88
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,541
What?

89
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:58,377
Hey, easy, Russ. They probably
just think we're someone else.

90
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:02,548
Um, I'm Dwayne.
We're the new hockey team. And you are...?

91
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:06,677
Varsity. The only hockey team.

92
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,554
State champs.

93
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:11,181
You know, my little brother
lost his J.V. slot

94
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,559
when they brought you yo-yos in here.

95
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,769
Probably wasn't good enough.

96
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,064
See, that's my dad.

97
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,525
He's gonna get the board
to revoke your scholarships.

98
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,860
Just you wait.

99
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,278
That's your dad?

100
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,780
Nice outfit.
Did it come with a yacht?

101
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:32,619
Averman, where are you taking us?

102
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:35,414
- Hey, Connie, look over here.
- Okay, everybody, follow me.

103
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,458
Nice tie, Banks. Cake-eater.

104
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,752
- Hey, Connie, come on.
- Charlie. Uh, uh, Charlie.

105
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:42,045
Turn right.

106
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,339
I'm a goalie, not a skater!

107
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,135
Hey, lady, watch out!

108
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,429
I'm sorry!

109
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,433
I got you, Goldie! I'm coming!

110
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:58,228
- I'm done, man!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

111
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:03,984
Charlie! Where are you?

112
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:07,279
Help me!

113
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,323
Move it!

114
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:12,159
What's this? What's this?

115
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:16,246
Get it off me, Charlie!

116
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:18,332
I can't see!

117
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,959
Oh, no!

118
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:23,795
Goldberg! Goldberg!

119
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,714
- There's a pit bull!
- Charlie, where are you?

120
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,424
Cujo's after you, man!

121
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,969
I can't see! I can't see! What's that?

122
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:32,804
Is that you?

123
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,065
Charlie!

124
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:46,777
Charlie, it's stuck!

125
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,820
- It's got me!
- Put down the hose!

126
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:53,617
The hose!

127
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,207
Welcome. Since its inception in 1903,

128
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:02,668
Eden Hall Academy

129
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:07,005
has taken great pride in its illustrious
tradition of excellence.

130
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:10,509
Yet... as we approach
the coming millennium,

131
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:16,557
we dare not shrink from the specter
of inevitable change.

132
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,809
What did he say?

133
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,186
Something about a shrinking sphincter.

134
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:24,815
"Shrinking sphincter."

135
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:28,860
Oh, there's cars, Charlie!

136
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:31,321
Help!

137
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:38,704
Whoa!

138
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:47,254
What do I do, Charlie?

139
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:52,426
- Charlie!
- I got ya! I got ya! Gotcha!

140
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:53,677
All right.

141
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,141
Bridge!

142
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,068
Yeah! Goldberg! Yeah!

143
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:12,613
Goldberg, don't you ever
do that to me again!

144
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:15,073
Thus, myself, the board,

145
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:17,909
Tom Riley of the alumni association

146
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:22,748
and Varsity Coach Wilson, who has led us
to ten consecutive state championships,

147
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:27,294
All right, guys!

148
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,129
BUCKLEY:.<i>.. we have all made
a change for the future.</i>

149
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,881
Hey, Averman, I'd wipe my
Rollerblades if I were you!

150
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,090
<i>So, today, after much debate...</i>

151
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:34,301
<i>on both sides,
we proudly open our...</i>

152
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,552
Out of the way! Coming through!

153
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,888
...doors via full scholarships

154
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:41,016
to a truly gifted
group of student athletes.

155
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,601
So, will you please join me...

156
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,020
<i>in giving a big,
rousing Warrior welcome...</i>

157
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,480
Let's go! Let's go!

158
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,440
Let's sneak in the back.
All right, let's go.

159
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:50,192
...to the gold medal winners
of the Junior Goodwill Games.

160
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,612
I present to you...

161
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:56,448
Hey, get off of me!

162
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:01,662
Hi.

163
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,623
We're the Ducks.

164
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:10,796
Hey, check it out.
He knows Wayne Newton.

165
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,882
Charlie, man, this is not
a good start to our year.

166
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:17,636
Don't worry, Kenny. These prepsters
aren't gonna do anything to us.

167
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,639
Check it out. Antsville.

168
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,892
Look at 'em go. Whoa.

169
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,437
You can learn a lot from ants.

170
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:31,983
These Brazilian fire ants
can teach you a lot

171
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,486
about successful societal structure.

172
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:39,074
You see there's one queen in there.

173
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:42,119
The rest are dedicated worker ants.

174
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:44,037
Everybody pulls their weight.

175
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:48,041
Nobody complains. There's harmony
and growth. Same here at Eden Hall.

176
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,294
Only you are the workers, the backbone.

177
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:52,963
And you're the queen?

178
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:56,341
Hmm.

179
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:59,302
Every Monday
you'll have a practice quiz,

180
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,346
every Wednesday
you'll have a real quiz,

181
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,891
every Friday you'll have an exam,
and anytime I feel like it

182
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:07,310
you'll have a surprise quiz or exam.

183
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,146
It's been said...

184
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:12,315
that the present is to the past...

185
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,402
like a dwarf...

186
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:19,072
on the shoulders of a giant.

187
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:22,534
If the dwarf holds his seat,

188
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:25,203
he can, indeed,
see further than the giant.

189
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:28,832
But beware if the dwarf
should grow careless...

190
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:32,627
and forget his place.

191
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:37,340
History... is a giant.

192
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,719
Get ready to ride.

193
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:51,438
Hey, what's he looking at?

194
00:12:57,152 --> 00:13:00,030
Ow! A hard check into the board.
That has to hurt.

195
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:05,327
All this work makes me hungry.

196
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:10,540
- Hey, Ken.
- What's up, Ken?

197
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,292
Homework on the first day.
Man, I don't believe it.

198
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:13,376
Yeah, I know.

199
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,837
We better be careful or we're
gonna learn something here.

200
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:21,384
Hi. Uh, will you sign a petition?

201
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:24,805
Uh...

202
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,932
Uh, yeah, sure. What's it for?

203
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:29,935
We're demanding the board change
the demeaning Warrior name.

204
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:32,896
Well, Warriors isn't so bad, is it?

205
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,315
I mean, you got the Indians,
the Braves, the Redskins,

206
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,525
the Blackhawks.

207
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:38,151
You're a jock, aren't you?

208
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:40,654
Yeah, I play hockey. In fact...

209
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:43,698
I'm the captain of the new J.V. team.

210
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,493
Forget about it.

211
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,287
All you Warrior jocks stick together.

212
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:51,289
But I'm not a Warrior, I'm a Duck.

213
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,750
- Hi, Kim. Will you sign a petition?
- Sure.

214
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,761
Wow, this place is great.

215
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,221
This is a nice rink.

216
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:07,305
It's huge.

217
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,141
You know, I bet they
even have a snack bar here.

218
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:12,811
- Big deal.
- They look pretty good.

219
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,980
They sure won a lot of championships.

220
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,940
- They're huge.
- They're not so hot.

221
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,109
Come on, guys, we could skate out there.

222
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:24,489
My dad says it was all
just a publicity stunt,

223
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:26,658
but it's gonna wind up
killing the school's reputation.

224
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:30,328
Yeah. Them rejects should have
stayed on their own side of the tracks.

225
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:32,455
Those rejects, genius.

226
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,499
Besides, we don't have tracks, Cole.

227
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:38,003
You see, there's no trains;
therefore, no tracks. Do you get that?

228
00:14:38,253 --> 00:14:40,422
Well, they should stay out of our school.

229
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:43,675
- Don't get smart with me, goalie.
- Hey, come on, Scooter.

230
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,677
You know better than to confuse Cole.

231
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,095
We're on the same team.

232
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:54,394
- If it isn't Captain Ducky.
- Get your hands off him.

233
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:57,522
Ooh, look. A Bash Brother.

234
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,941
I'm so scared.

235
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:02,110
Break it up!
Come on, men, let's go.

236
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,489
How about it, Cowboy?
Round up?

237
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,993
Hey, Charlie, shouldn't we wait
for the new coach before we mess around?

238
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:11,494
This is how we practice.

239
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,204
Duck hockey, Connie.

240
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,999
You'll have to get used to it
sooner or later.

241
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,501
Well, come on, Cowboy. Hit it.

242
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,129
Yee-ha! Round 'em up, doggies!

243
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:25,216
- Here I come, y'all!
- Watch out, here he comes!

244
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,303
Whoo! Come here!
Come here, boy!

245
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,390
Come on, come on, come on!

246
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,684
- Watch out, girls.
- Let's go! Come on!

247
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,686
You can't hit the broadside of a barn!

248
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:40,982
You can't get away from me, can you?

249
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:45,070
Charlie... Aw, he's got Fulton.

250
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:55,914
Whoa, Charlie, you're done, boy!

251
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:08,218
My name is Coach Orion.

252
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:10,595
You can call me "Coach"

253
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,014
or "Coach Orion."

254
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:15,850
Well, you can call me "Charlie."

255
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:16,893
Is he nuts?

256
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:19,437
That must be what that "C"
on your jersey stands for, huh?

257
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:21,982
It sure doesn't stand for "captain."

258
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:26,444
Sorry, Coach. We were just messin'
with you, you know?

259
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,571
Hey, Bombay gave him that "C."

260
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:30,991
And I respect that, but that's the past.

261
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,577
This is my team now,
and I'll be selecting the captain.

262
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,288
You gotta be kidding me, right?
I mean, you're the rookie here.

263
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,958
- We all been together for four years.
- Yeah.

264
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:44,045
Okay, Charlie, laps.
Right now.

265
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,882
- <i>Uh-oh.</i>
- How many, Coach Orion?

266
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,427
I don't recall saying.

267
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:57,684
Now you listen up, and you listen up good.

268
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,771
We are here for one reason
and one reason only.

269
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,649
You know what that is?

270
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:06,943
It starts with a "W."

271
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:09,821
To win, Coach Orion, sir!

272
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:12,157
No.

273
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,575
To work!

274
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:17,328
High school hockey is very hard work.

275
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:22,667
And it all begins... with defense.

276
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,296
I've seen your tapes.
I know you can score goals.

277
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:30,091
- I just don't know if you can stop them.
- Hey.

278
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,011
Sorry, sir.

279
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:38,016
You're not kids or little ducks anymore,

280
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,018
so I'm not gonna treat you that way.

281
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:42,187
You're gonna learn to play two-way hockey:

282
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,314
offense and defense.

283
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:46,941
It's gonna take one thing.

284
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,903
It starts with a "W."

285
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:51,863
To work, Coach Orion, sir!

286
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,281
Wrong.

287
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:55,867
Will.

288
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:59,913
It's gonna take real will...

289
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:02,457
if you want to play in my barn.

290
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:05,877
All right.

291
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:09,297
Count off. Let's climb the ladder.

292
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,716
One. Two. Three.

293
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:15,637
Whoo, all right, Banks. Let's see what
you got, baby. Come on. Bring it up.

294
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,971
Yeah. Ooh!

295
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,140
Nice shot. Very nice.

296
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,394
Lucky shot. Merry Christmas, Guy.

297
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,023
Cowboy, you don't impress me.

298
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,568
Averman, have you been practicing?

299
00:18:31,236 --> 00:18:34,239
- Ha! Hang time!
- Baryshnikov, knock that off!

300
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:35,824
Goldberg!

301
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:38,576
When's the last time you practiced?

302
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,663
Well, uh...

303
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:44,499
we don't really practice, per se.

304
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:49,504
We either play
or play around. You know, have fun.

305
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:53,842
You know, that thing that makes you
smile and laugh. Ha, ha, ha!

306
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,512
Okay, I'll shut up.

307
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:01,766
Sorry, Connie.

308
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,018
Good shot, Dwayne.

309
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:05,937
Next time, Russ.

310
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,778
Somebody get a shovel
and bury me right here.

311
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:17,448
I will teach you to play like what?
Starts with a "W"!

312
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:18,616
Wussies.

313
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,827
That's right. Wussies
on offense and defense!

314
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,120
Defense, defense, defense!

315
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:28,626
Eden Hall Academy requires you
to maintain a "C" average to compete.

316
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:31,045
- Cool.
- I believe that's a bad rule.

317
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:33,464
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm. Go, Coach.

318
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,466
I don't want any "C" players on my team.

319
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,468
I want B's or better

320
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,470
or you're gonna be riding the pine pony.

321
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:43,016
Now you got 15 minutes after each
practice to clear this locker room.

322
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,601
You got homework to do.

323
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,477
Oh, one more thing.

324
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,146
Stay clear of the varsity

325
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:50,648
until we play 'em
in the J.V.-Varsity Showdown.

326
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:53,484
You got that?

327
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,071
Mm-hmm.

328
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:02,285
Fifteen minutes?

329
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,204
Man, I cannot move.

330
00:20:04,287 --> 00:20:06,748
Hey, you guys, look.
He posted our positions.

331
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,713
I don't believe this.
I play left side not right.

332
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,131
Third line!

333
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,008
Man, that's a major diss.

334
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,638
- I'm not even posted.
- Yeah, you are.

335
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,514
Adam Banks, third line, center.

336
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:27,018
- Varsity?
- I made varsity?

337
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,354
That's the great thing
about being goalie, you know?

338
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:31,022
You always know where you stand.

339
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:34,651
I just mind my business,
take my place between the pipes.

340
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,028
You're riding the pine pony, pal.

341
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:39,822
Very funny.

342
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,824
Julie's one. You're two.

343
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:44,994
I'm backup?

344
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,918
How can he do this to me?

345
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:54,837
- What am I, chopped liver?
- Hey...

346
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,131
who... who's Captain Tibid?

347
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,009
Oh, that's Captain T.B.D.
To be determined.

348
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:01,928
Oh. Oh, I see.

349
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:04,472
Well, no, I don't.

350
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:06,849
That's your job, Charlie.

351
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,211
School was not so fun today, eh, Charlie?

352
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:38,381
How'd you know it was me?

353
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:43,011
Hmm, only two people
can open a door so sadly:

354
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,096
you and Gordon.

355
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:47,890
Now just one more pass.

356
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,273
I've really done it this time, Charlie!

357
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:58,276
Get me a tourniquet, eh?

358
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:01,279
Knock it off, Hans.

359
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:04,115
Wipe off the ketchup,
and stop trying to cheer me up.

360
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:10,079
School is a nightmare,

361
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:12,123
especially our new hockey coach.

362
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,125
Have you ever heard of Ted Orion?

363
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:19,297
Yes. Yes, h... he left the North Stars
when he was still in his prime.

364
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,673
This guy is no Duck.

365
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:23,926
Perhaps you should
show him the way, Charlie.

366
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:28,348
He doesn't exactly seem
open to new learning experiences.

367
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:29,766
The question is...

368
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,476
are you?

369
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,857
So what if she has a quicker glove.
Who's got the better stick?

370
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,067
You do, Goldberg.

371
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,651
I know that.
And who's got the game experience,

372
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:42,820
- me or the Catlady?
- You do.

373
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:44,113
Mm-hmm.

374
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,699
Well, she's just quicker, uh, faster.

375
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:49,994
- That counts on this level.
- So what are you trying to say?

376
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:52,830
If I lost a few pounds,
maybe I'd be number one again?

377
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:56,542
It might be easier
to have her gain a few pounds.

378
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:58,878
Hey, little man, yesterday's
lunch was pretty good.

379
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,546
What have we got today?

380
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:03,591
- Bag of chips.
- Oh. Hey.

381
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,176
And some cookies.

382
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:07,637
What do we have here?

383
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:10,848
- Just give it back.
- A sandwich. Get outta here.

384
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:13,101
Yeah.

385
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,103
I could maim that big goon.

386
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:17,355
But with Portman here,
we could take 'em all.

387
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,066
They want lunch...

388
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,111
we'll give 'em lunch.

389
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:25,571
Let's go, boys.

390
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:31,536
Uh, this seat is taken.

391
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:33,329
No one's sitting in it.

392
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:35,540
Well, this is a cheerleading section.

393
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:37,500
Warrior cheerleaders only.

394
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:39,252
Are you a cheerleader?

395
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,170
Do I look like an idiot?

396
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,005
Airhead.

397
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:47,260
How ya doin'?

398
00:23:47,385 --> 00:23:49,554
Uh, the freshman girls are over there.

399
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,514
Girls. Yes, I know.

400
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:53,474
I'm in search of a real woman.

401
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:56,686
- You're crazy, you know that?
<i>- Loco.</i>

402
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:58,729
Yes, of course. For you.

403
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:01,107
Just give me five minutes after school,

404
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:03,151
and I will die a happy man.

405
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:05,153
If you don't beat it,
you probably will die.

406
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:07,029
My boyfriend gets pretty jealous.

407
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:28,176
Make sure it's fresh.

408
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:30,636
- Steam's a good sign.
- Very good.

409
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:36,517
Just want to congratulate you
on being number one.

410
00:24:36,601 --> 00:24:40,855
I didn't have time to bake a cake so
I bought you a yummy array of goodies.

411
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:43,357
- Thanks, Goldberg.
- Hey, no problem.

412
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:46,527
You know, you're gonna need a lot
of energy to play on this level.

413
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:49,238
Carbo loading, you know?
See...

414
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:52,617
See, this thing right here
is packed with energy.

415
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:54,494
Give it a shot.

416
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:57,997
<i>- See?</i>
- Mmm.

417
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,624
- Good, huh?
- It's good.

418
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,376
Now, uh, I could even be
your, uh...

419
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:05,463
nutritional advisor if you want.
No charge.

420
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:07,298
- Hmm.
- What do you say?

421
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:09,550
- Great.
- Try this one.

422
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,766
- Oh, come on, my mommy made me brownies.
- Yeah.

423
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,226
Fresh, warm ones.

424
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:20,436
Hey, it's too bad about your Bash Brother.

425
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,230
Heard he was too scared to leave home.

426
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:24,023
Portman ain't scared of nothin'.

427
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:29,278
Phew!

428
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:32,114
What the hell kind
of brownies are these?

429
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,449
I gotta tell her...

430
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:35,952
to stop using the horse turds
in the recipe.

431
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:37,954
Get 'em!

432
00:25:44,085 --> 00:25:46,379
Thanks for not letting me sit there.

433
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:55,763
Let's get 'em! Come on!

434
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,141
Dean.

435
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:00,268
Fellas.

436
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:01,769
- Dean, nice tie.
- Lovely day.

437
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:03,354
Good boys.

438
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,414
Work those legs, Gaffney!

439
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:22,915
Where's your energy?

440
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:25,126
I think I'm gonna be sick.

441
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:29,964
One cupcake over the line, Catlady.

442
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:33,801
This is total crap.
I can't play for this drill sergeant.

443
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:35,219
Play for us, Charlie.

444
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:36,762
The Ducks. Come on, man.

445
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,639
All right, Fulton.

446
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:41,183
Get low, bend your knees,
smooth strokes.

447
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,271
That's it, Fulton. Stay low.

448
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,148
Julie the Cat!

449
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:49,483
What's the matter, you eat a fur ball?

450
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:53,154
Yeah, that's good, Coach.
I like that. Fur ball.

451
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:55,072
That's, uh, very clever.

452
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,866
Just get in the net, Goldberg.

453
00:26:57,074 --> 00:27:00,244
Me? Sure thing. Be my pleasure.

454
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:01,787
Yeah!

455
00:27:01,871 --> 00:27:03,289
Over here, over here.

456
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:05,666
You know, I don't see a captain out here!

457
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:07,627
On your left. Pass it.

458
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,046
Make him make the first move, Conway!

459
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:16,969
- Hey, Averman, you got nothing!
- Over here, Charlie!

460
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:19,513
Come on, Charlie, clear it out!
Clear it out!

461
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:22,892
Freeze! I said freeze!

462
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:26,062
Averman!

463
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:27,647
I did freeze.

464
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:31,901
Where's the one place you
never want to clear the puck?

465
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,445
- It looked open.
- Just answer the question, Conway.

466
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,906
Listen, I'm not a defenseman,
I'm a scorer!

467
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,579
Follow me.

468
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:57,927
Anybody share his opinion?

469
00:28:03,224 --> 00:28:04,850
All right then, take a knee.

470
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:20,783
What's the one thing all
great teams have in common?

471
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:23,828
- Great coaching.
- Don't try to suck up to me, Averman.

472
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:27,540
Defense.

473
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,587
See, unlike scoring, defense never quits.

474
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:37,758
But to play great defense,
you need one thing above all else.

475
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:39,927
Bet it starts with a "W."

476
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:41,595
Confidence.

477
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:49,061
Listen, if you learn nothing
else when you're here, you learn this.

478
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:52,481
All right?
'Cause it's not just about hockey.

479
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:57,486
It's easy to be confident
when you have control of the puck.

480
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,322
It's very, very difficult
to keep that confidence

481
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:03,951
when you gotta take whatever
strange bounces life throws your way.

482
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:07,496
Don't be careless,
but don't be too careful either.

483
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,999
You cannot be afraid to lose.

484
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,920
That's how you gain the confidence
to attack the game

485
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:17,214
when the puck isn't yours.

486
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:20,259
That's how you attack life,

487
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,596
even when you think
you don't have any control.

488
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,520
And that's how you play real defense.

489
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:40,446
Is this seat taken?

490
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:47,578
You know, you are just like
the rest of those snobs.

491
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:50,331
I am not a snob.

492
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:51,582
Oh, really?

493
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:54,126
Well, you don't like me
because I'm an athlete.

494
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,545
That's a snob. You don't even know me.

495
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:58,547
If I knew you, I wouldn't like you.

496
00:29:59,757 --> 00:30:01,634
Oh, yeah? Well, try me.

497
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:03,761
Hi, I'm Charlie Conway.

498
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:06,388
I'm a 14-year-old,
almost six-foot, nonsmoking Leo.

499
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:08,808
I like hockey, pizza and music.

500
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:11,644
And I dislike
everything about that school.

501
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,146
Except maybe you.

502
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:16,398
Now you try.

503
00:30:17,942 --> 00:30:19,401
I'm Linda.

504
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:21,487
I don't like it here either.

505
00:30:23,364 --> 00:30:24,740
And pizza?

506
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:26,742
- I like pizza.
- Music?

507
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:28,828
Of course I like music.

508
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,412
I like Pantera.

509
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:32,832
No way! I love Pantera.

510
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:35,417
So the only thing
we don't agree on is hockey.

511
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,628
Too violent?

512
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:39,713
Don't understand the rules?

513
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:43,300
I have to admit I've never been to a game.

514
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:47,680
You have never heard
of the Anaheim Mighty Ducks?

515
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:50,766
They named a pro team after us.

516
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,643
Sorry.

517
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:54,812
Oh, man.

518
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:57,481
Well, uh...

519
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:01,110
we have a game on Friday.

520
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:06,782
And... I was just thinking that
maybe you could come down

521
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:09,451
and we could snag a Coke
or something afterwards?

522
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:13,956
I still don't know you that well.

523
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:17,001
Did I tell you
I'm allergic to nuts?

524
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,962
Any kind of nut. I swear.
I blow up. It's kind of gross.

525
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,172
And R.E.M.? Yeah?

526
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:24,133
John Woo movies?

527
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:26,802
And I really like talking to you.

528
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,098
What else?

529
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,309
I don't know.

530
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:35,728
Just keep talkin'.

531
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:40,691
Yes!

532
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:51,327
It appears
the entire school has turned out to see

533
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,997
the once Mighty Ducks, I mean,
rather, the, um, Eden Hall Warriors

534
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,999
do battle with the Blake freshman Bears.

535
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,484
They better be damn good
if they hope to stay.

536
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:25,152
Relax, Tom, it's in the bag.

537
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,071
Alan, just in time.

538
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:30,199
Gather around. Let's go.
Hustle up. Come on.

539
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:35,579
All right, think defense.

540
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,207
All right, hands in. Here we go.

541
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:42,711
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

542
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:44,505
What the hell's that? Knock that off.

543
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:48,884
All right, "Go, team" on two.
Here we go, one, two.

544
00:32:48,968 --> 00:32:50,886
- Go, team.
- All right, come on.

545
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,389
- "Go, team." How original.
- Just get in the game, Charlie.

546
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,140
Let's do it, Charlie.

547
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:57,601
<i>Point of fact,</i>

548
00:32:57,685 --> 00:32:59,853
<i>Charlie Conway is not wearing
the traditional captain "C".</i>

549
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:02,731
<i>He's been this team's captain since
they played in District Five.</i>

550
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:04,608
<i>I guess Coach Orion's making a statement.</i>

551
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:31,010
Get 'em, Charlie!

552
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,222
What did I tell you?

553
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:36,724
That's my Ducks!

554
00:33:42,146 --> 00:33:45,149
All right, knock off the celebration!

555
00:33:45,232 --> 00:33:47,568
Act like you've scored before, huh?

556
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:52,656
Come on, guys, give me something to do.

557
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:54,366
Pass it over here, man.

558
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:57,870
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's knuckle-puck time!

559
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,961
Yeah, knocked him out.

560
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:09,798
Hey, ref. You know,
you can call this thing now,

561
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:12,509
and we can all get home
in time to see <i>Melrose.</i>

562
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:26,106
Go, Luis, go, go!

563
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:28,942
He can't stop!
He's got no brakes!

564
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:34,156
I can't stop!

565
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,244
Man, that was fresh.

566
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:40,829
- Great, Luis! You scored, man!
- You scored!

567
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:41,955
Way to go!

568
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:44,792
- You scored!
- You scored, Luis! It was amazing!

569
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,794
- Are you okay?
- I love our team.

570
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:48,504
Oh, I guess not.

571
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:52,174
Get 'em, boys!

572
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:54,093
Ya-hoo!

573
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,345
How do you like them apples, huh?

574
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:03,018
Quick draw! Ya-hoo!

575
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:05,562
Come down here.

576
00:35:05,646 --> 00:35:07,314
Why don't you take a shot at me?

577
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,441
I'm so bored!

578
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,820
<i>Conway passes to Averman
who hits the zone and...</i>

579
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:16,031
<i>Oh! That's a hook if I've ever
seen one. He gets the pass off Fulton.</i>

580
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:17,699
<i>Look out!</i>

581
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,170
Yeah, I spun that dude!

582
00:35:30,254 --> 00:35:32,631
Yo, Russ, you got to teach
me how to talk some trash.

583
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,383
It can't be taught, Kenny, man.

584
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,635
I mean, it's got to be the first thing
that comes to your mind.

585
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:38,804
You just got to go for it. Try it.

586
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,472
Okay. Hey, ref, you...

587
00:35:40,556 --> 00:35:42,933
Uh-uh, shh. Pick another target.

588
00:35:43,684 --> 00:35:46,603
Hey, number 44, you, you, you,
you play, you play...

589
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:48,647
You don't play real good.

590
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:50,149
Yeah, right.

591
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:52,442
Shorter, man. Get to the point.

592
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,570
Hey, number nine, bite me!

593
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:57,447
Man.

594
00:35:57,531 --> 00:35:59,741
Now we're getting somewhere.

595
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:15,549
Huh?

596
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:18,177
Huh?

597
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:24,975
You did good!

598
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:27,019
The hand is quicker than the eye,
my friend.

599
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:30,772
<i>♪ Fulton scored, Fulton scored
I am really bored ♪</i>

600
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:34,985
<i>♪ Fulton's great, Fulton's great
A year ago, I couldn't even skate ♪♪</i>

601
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,715
Come on, Charlie!

602
00:36:56,798 --> 00:37:00,135
Unbelievable! Conway gets the hat trick
from somewhere out in the ozone!

603
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:03,138
At the end of two,
it's Eden Hall nine, Blake zero.

604
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:06,058
- <i>It's over, folks.</i>
- That's my Ducks.

605
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:09,311
I think we're witnessing
the birth of a dynasty, Tom.

606
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:22,532
- Relax. It's over, baby.
- Come on, boys, let's go.

607
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:47,849
Damn.

608
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:50,560
Tighten up!

609
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,071
Oh, man.

610
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:03,532
<i>Oh, and there goes
the shutout, folks.</i>

611
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:04,866
We'll give you one.

612
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,743
All right, change it up.
Mendoza, Robertson.

613
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:15,877
Where's defense?

614
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:23,844
- Moreau, Conway, change it.
- All right, let's do it, guys.

615
00:38:29,308 --> 00:38:31,643
Clear the net!

616
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:33,729
- Clear the net!
- Come on!

617
00:38:40,444 --> 00:38:41,987
Germaine, Fulton, change it!

618
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:48,201
<i>Score! And Blake pumps in another.</i>

619
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:54,708
Come try and get me this time.

620
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,631
Make him make
the first move, Conway!

621
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:16,897
Two minutes, unsportsmanlike.

622
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,025
- Let's go, son, to the box! Come on.
- What? Are you blind?

623
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:22,736
<i>- To the box, let's go.
- You decide to take the whistle out now?</i>

624
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:24,029
<i>Give me a break!</i>

625
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:26,281
Now, is that sportsmanship?

626
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:27,866
Get in the box.

627
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:32,371
96, white, two minutes,
unsportsmanlike conduct.

628
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:34,706
Unsportsmanlike,
I'll show you unsportsmanlike.

629
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,584
Oh, my, Conway is really hot. He'll
get two for unsportsmanlike conduct.

630
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:40,962
Where has the Warriors'
defense gone this period?

631
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:43,757
Charlie, calm yourself. Play the game.

632
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,468
Gaffney! Goldberg, change it.

633
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:49,304
Me? Uh, yeah, Coach,
comin' right up!

634
00:39:49,388 --> 00:39:51,807
It's a total breakdown up front.
It's up to you.

635
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:53,517
No problem, Catlady.

636
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,402
Oh, no, he stole it!

637
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:04,611
Stop him!

638
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:14,329
You telling me my youngest boy isn't
good enough to play for this team?

639
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:21,503
<i>In a last-ditch effort,
Blake is pulling their goalie.</i>

640
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:24,756
Thirty left, and the Warriors
are desperately trying to hang on.

641
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,800
Conway's out of the box
and skating hard.

642
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:28,802
Clear it, Charlie, clear it!

643
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:35,851
- Pass it here, Charlie.
- Come on, Charlie!

644
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,394
Do it, Charlie!

645
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:39,354
Knock it off, Charlie. Pass it.

646
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,234
Over here, Charlie!
We already won!

647
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:47,028
Charlie, no!

648
00:40:52,826 --> 00:40:54,035
No!

649
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:02,586
Oh, no.

650
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:05,589
Come on, where's the "D"?

651
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:11,595
<i>Oh, there goes
the buzzer. This baby is over.</i>

652
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:14,556
<i>A very disappointing tie
for the Eden Hall Warriors.</i>

653
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:18,435
They opened their cabin door and let
those Blake Bears climb right in.

654
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:31,406
The guy hooked me, all right?

655
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:33,158
We didn't need any more goals.

656
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:36,786
- Hey, listen, I was trying to win it!
- Well, mission unaccomplished, Charlie.

657
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:39,206
- Huh?
- We let down, simple as that.

658
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:42,000
Hey, you let down. I played hard.

659
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:44,920
Yeah, man, no heart.

660
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:48,340
Well, what are we playing for anyway?

661
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:51,343
Some stupid school, the alumni?

662
00:41:51,635 --> 00:41:53,220
I mean, Warriors?

663
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:55,972
- What the hell are we now?
- Look, man!

664
00:41:56,139 --> 00:41:57,557
We're on scholarship.

665
00:41:58,391 --> 00:41:59,768
I'm staying.

666
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,353
Fine, sell-out.

667
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:05,315
- Man, who you calling a sell-out, punk!
- Hey, get your hands off him!

668
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:07,651
- Hold up, Charlie!
- Charlie, stop it!

669
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:12,656
How long does it take to score a goal?

670
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:18,703
Less than a second!

671
00:42:20,914 --> 00:42:24,292
That means no lead is safe
if you can't play defense!

672
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,419
Now get this straight!

673
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:28,713
I don't give a damn
how many goals you score.

674
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:32,092
zero, as in shutout.

675
00:42:32,968 --> 00:42:34,469
You got that?

676
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:44,604
Practice, tomorrow morning, 5:00 a.m.

677
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,399
Got to get up early
if you want to hunt goose eggs.

678
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,616
Hey, who took my clothes?

679
00:43:07,586 --> 00:43:09,212
They put our clothes...

680
00:43:10,005 --> 00:43:12,716
- Oh, man.
- That answers your question, doesn't it?

681
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:16,636
Ted. Ted.

682
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:21,057
I know you're as disappointed
in that tie as we are.

683
00:43:21,141 --> 00:43:22,851
Actually, I'd have preferred a loss.

684
00:43:22,976 --> 00:43:24,644
You're kidding, right, Coach?

685
00:43:24,728 --> 00:43:26,980
Well, you learn a hell of a lot more
from losing than from winning.

686
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:29,357
We don't have time for learning.
We need to win.

687
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:33,194
- They could lose their scholarships.
- You're kidding... right, Dean?

688
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,242
- I love this liquid nitrogen.
- I don't think it works.

689
00:43:39,326 --> 00:43:41,453
Yeah, it's working.
Hey, you think they're gonna miss

690
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:44,664
- this big old tank in chemistry class?
- What do you think?

691
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:48,335
- Hey, what about Banksie?
- He's one of them now, isn't he?

692
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:51,087
- Sad but true.
- How about full pressure?

693
00:43:51,171 --> 00:43:52,797
Sorry, cake-eater.

694
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:27,165
Ducks.

695
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:31,044
Just come in and sit down.

696
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:33,421
Thank you so much, Jeannie.
I'm sorry we're late.

697
00:44:33,505 --> 00:44:35,632
No problem, honey.
How was the game?

698
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:38,259
That good, huh?

699
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,178
I'll close out.

700
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:43,473
Listen, I'm taking a bus home.
See you later.

701
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:46,393
Uh, no, sir. You sit over there,
and you do your homework.

702
00:44:46,476 --> 00:44:48,186
I just watched you
jeopardize your hockey career.

703
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:49,938
I will not let you do it to your studies.

704
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:52,774
You have no idea what
it's like playing for that guy.

705
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:56,111
I don't care who your coach is.
Your behavior out there was juvenile.

706
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:59,698
- Well, yeah, because Coach Orion...
- "Because Coach Orion" nothing.

707
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:01,950
You used to feel the same
way about Coach Bombay, remember?

708
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:04,911
I think the only thing that needs to
change around here is your attitude.

709
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:06,121
What?

710
00:45:06,705 --> 00:45:09,040
Oh, give me a break.

711
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,759
I think that's a first time for me.

712
00:45:19,843 --> 00:45:22,887
- Check out the new jackets, guys.
- Hey, congrats on the Blake game.

713
00:45:22,971 --> 00:45:25,640
- Yeah, right. We tied.
- Hey, a point's a point.

714
00:45:25,724 --> 00:45:28,727
We're all Warriors now.
You guys proved your guts.

715
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,311
You all set for dinner Friday?

716
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:31,855
Dinner?

717
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:33,982
Well, it's an Eden Hall tradition.

718
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:36,151
Varsity got to treat
the freshmen to dinner.

719
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:38,653
So, round up your posse
and meet us

720
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:41,072
at 6:00 at the Minnesota Club, downtown.

721
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:43,616
Anybody need a ride, we can take you.

722
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:46,953
I mean, you guys do like
steak and seafood, right?

723
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:48,747
Yeah, we do.

724
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:51,207
Look, I don't like you pukes, all right?

725
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:53,126
But this is a tradition.

726
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:55,754
At Eden Hall,
I learned to care about tradition.

727
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:00,175
It's cool.

728
00:46:01,134 --> 00:46:02,677
Oh. It's cool.

729
00:46:02,761 --> 00:46:05,013
- Let's go. If Banks says it's cool.
- We might as well go.

730
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:07,015
- Good evening, sir.
- 'Evening.

731
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:19,235
I love this tradition!

732
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,321
At my old school,
we didn't have traditions like this.

733
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:24,407
Waiter, I've got too many forks.
I only need one.

734
00:46:24,491 --> 00:46:26,534
I don't... Y'all, I just...

735
00:46:26,618 --> 00:46:29,662
What's this little bitty one...
What's this little bitty...

736
00:46:29,746 --> 00:46:32,916
Hey, you got to show me
that triple deke, man. That's cool.

737
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:34,542
Yeah, sure.

738
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:38,671
- You know, it's easier than it looks.
- Oh, you're being modest.

739
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:44,093
Hey, Julie, want this
extra piece of prime rib?

740
00:46:44,177 --> 00:46:47,013
Look, I'm just trying to help you.

741
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:55,814
On behalf of the Eden Hall Warrior
Varsity State Champion hockey team,

742
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:58,650
I'd like to welcome
the future state champs,

743
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:00,902
the Eden Hall freshmen.

744
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:04,781
- Here, here.
- Here, here.

745
00:47:05,365 --> 00:47:06,825
We're just glad you loaned us Banksie

746
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:08,409
so that we'd have a chance
to beat you guys

747
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:10,495
in the annual
Freshmen-Varsity Showdown.

748
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:13,206
Now, nobody move.

749
00:47:13,665 --> 00:47:15,708
We've got one last surprise.

750
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:17,377
Fellas?

751
00:47:17,544 --> 00:47:20,004
I love surprises.

752
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:21,714
Banksie.

753
00:47:23,091 --> 00:47:25,051
Where are they going?

754
00:47:27,011 --> 00:47:28,930
Don't worry. We'll be right back.

755
00:47:29,347 --> 00:47:30,765
You got the candles?

756
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:36,104
Guys, I don't want to spoil anything,

757
00:47:36,229 --> 00:47:38,481
but I overheard something in the bathroom.
It's a cake.

758
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:40,024
Act surprised, all right?

759
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:46,739
What is that? Oh!

760
00:47:46,823 --> 00:47:48,408
Ah, they are too kind.

761
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:53,329
"Thanks for dinner, losers."

762
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,295
Oh, man.

763
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:07,886
Eight hundred and fifty-seven dollars.

764
00:48:07,969 --> 00:48:10,889
"Eight hundred
and fifty-seven dollars"?

765
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:13,308
Where are we
gonna get that kind of cash?

766
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:18,313
- You've really got to pick up the pace.
- I'm trying to pick it up.

767
00:48:23,276 --> 00:48:24,694
We got to respond.

768
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:30,283
Physics. Each action requires an equal,
if not bigger, reaction.

769
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:33,411
Hey, man, be cool.
I don't want to mess up my scholarship.

770
00:48:35,747 --> 00:48:37,415
I mean, let's not get caught.

771
00:48:37,624 --> 00:48:39,584
There you go.

772
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:43,421
Coast clear. Come on.

773
00:48:55,892 --> 00:48:57,810
Averman, what are you doing?

774
00:48:57,894 --> 00:48:59,520
- It's a cool sticker.
- Come on.

775
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:22,502
A little to the left.

776
00:49:32,804 --> 00:49:35,223
That's okay, it's just my face.
No big deal.

777
00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:37,850
How's it look to you, Cowboy?

778
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:40,019
<i>All secure.
I'll go check the other side.</i>

779
00:49:40,103 --> 00:49:42,563
- Come on, let me see.
- No, you keep a lookout.

780
00:49:44,399 --> 00:49:45,733
Careful, man.

781
00:49:45,817 --> 00:49:48,403
They don't call them
Brazilian fire ants for nothing.

782
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,280
Do you think he's gonna notice
them missing?

783
00:49:51,364 --> 00:49:53,658
I don't think
he keeps a head count, Charlie.

784
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:05,878
Hey, you a stray calf?

785
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:07,922
What the...

786
00:50:08,006 --> 00:50:10,883
Ha, it'd be more fun for me if you ran.

787
00:50:15,847 --> 00:50:19,267
Whoo, little doggies!

788
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:23,730
- Whoo, you better run!
- Guys!

789
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:25,231
I'm gonna get you.

790
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:27,275
They got horses!

791
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:29,485
I got you now, boy!

792
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:33,114
Oh, man, you are dead, man!

793
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:36,200
Dead! You hear me?

794
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:38,202
Thank you!

795
00:50:38,286 --> 00:50:41,247
This ninja stuff really
makes you look, uh...

796
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:43,916
I... I don't know how you say, um...

797
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,835
Ruggedly handsome?

798
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:47,545
Amazingly stupid.

799
00:50:47,879 --> 00:50:49,213
Very funny.

800
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:50,757
Did you get 'em?

801
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:52,925
Yeah, only a couple, you know...

802
00:50:53,009 --> 00:50:55,094
- Here, use the funnel.
- ...hundred.

803
00:50:55,178 --> 00:50:57,305
Release the hungry fellows.

804
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:59,766
Drop 'em in there.

805
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:08,149
There, there.

806
00:51:19,952 --> 00:51:21,370
Look at 'em go!

807
00:51:48,231 --> 00:51:50,191
What is this? Get 'em off me!
Get 'em off my back, man!

808
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:52,193
- Get 'em off me!
- What the heck are these things, man?

809
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,862
Get 'em off! Let's get out of here!

810
00:51:54,946 --> 00:51:57,490
- Open it! Why aren't you opening it?
- Open the door!

811
00:51:59,242 --> 00:52:01,661
Open it! Open it!

812
00:52:01,744 --> 00:52:03,830
Go on, go on, let 'em out, let 'em out.

813
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,292
Let's get out of here!

814
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,129
I gotta wash this off!

815
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:13,506
- Ow, these hurt!
- Ow, these things are burning!

816
00:52:17,552 --> 00:52:20,304
You think you're funny, huh?
You think you're worth a damn?

817
00:52:20,388 --> 00:52:23,349
- You're just white trash!
- Uh, who you callin' white trash?

818
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:26,394
That's right.
We'll take you anytime, anywhere.

819
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:29,355
- Tomorrow, dawn!
- I gotta get to the showers!

820
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:31,524
Come again. Bye-bye.
Dinner was great. Thank you.

821
00:52:31,607 --> 00:52:32,692
Move it!

822
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:36,487
Don't forget to wash
behind the ears. Good-bye.

823
00:52:36,571 --> 00:52:39,699
I'm gonna kill you guys!

824
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:43,995
Oh, boy. I think it's time to leave.

825
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:46,038
- Uh-oh.
- See ya.

826
00:52:46,122 --> 00:52:49,250
Come on!

827
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,276
Coach says I'm the starter.

828
00:53:16,485 --> 00:53:18,738
Coach? I don't see any coach.

829
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:20,406
We'll split the shifts.

830
00:53:21,741 --> 00:53:23,659
I want a piece of these guys.

831
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:32,668
Hey, can we call it even?

832
00:53:32,919 --> 00:53:34,295
I hate ties.

833
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:36,714
They're like kissing your brother.

834
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:41,594
Oh, ants in your mask?

835
00:53:41,677 --> 00:53:45,097
Ah, it looks like
you're a goalie for a dart team.

836
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:46,849
Yeah, yeah.

837
00:53:49,227 --> 00:53:50,394
I... I'll go now.

838
00:53:51,062 --> 00:53:52,104
Punk.

839
00:53:52,772 --> 00:53:54,732
They didn't tell me until it was too late.

840
00:53:55,191 --> 00:53:58,027
- Charlie, believe me.
- Yeah, right, preppy.

841
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:02,240
- Okay, guys, concentrate now!
- Check! Set!

842
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:08,287
First to ten. Full check.

843
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:09,538
Bring it on.

844
00:54:12,667 --> 00:54:14,252
Hey!

845
00:54:14,335 --> 00:54:15,962
- Oh!
- Dang!

846
00:54:20,508 --> 00:54:21,842
I got my eye on you.

847
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:24,595
All right. Two for one!

848
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:30,226
Come on, buddy, make your move!
Make your move!

849
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:40,403
Easy.

850
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:42,655
- Get loose, Charlie.
- Come on, Charlie.

851
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:45,199
Flying "V"!

852
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:48,577
I love when they do the "V."

853
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:05,761
Oh, man. Oh, please.

854
00:55:09,765 --> 00:55:12,184
Shoot it! Shoot it!

855
00:55:12,268 --> 00:55:15,229
Oh, come on!

856
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:23,946
Come on, defense. Let's go.

857
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:27,742
Hey, can I get a little defense here?

858
00:55:27,908 --> 00:55:30,161
What do you say, huh?
Help me out.

859
00:55:47,053 --> 00:55:48,888
Try the triple deke.

860
00:56:06,322 --> 00:56:07,990
What do I have to do?

861
00:56:16,791 --> 00:56:18,125
Gotta get by me first, baby.

862
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:25,883
Quack, quack, quack,

863
00:56:26,217 --> 00:56:27,885
Mr. Goalie Boy.

864
00:56:29,762 --> 00:56:31,597
What was that, huh?

865
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:34,350
- Let me at him, Charlie.
- Oh, hey, here's one.

866
00:56:34,475 --> 00:56:35,559
You got a little problem?

867
00:56:35,643 --> 00:56:37,728
Come on, sweetie.
Come on, take a shot.

868
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:40,940
Come on. No? No? Huh?
Maybe later, huh?

869
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:46,695
- You want some, punk?
- Settle down, boys.

870
00:56:46,779 --> 00:56:49,657
- We can't win if they're gonna cheat.
- Don't show 'em we're hurt.

871
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:50,908
Keep skatin'.

872
00:56:56,997 --> 00:56:59,750
Banks! Get him, Banks!

873
00:57:03,129 --> 00:57:05,506
- Damn it, Banks!
- Icing!

874
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:07,591
Charlie, watch your back.

875
00:57:07,675 --> 00:57:10,094
- That's it. Let's get 'em!
- Let's go, guys. Get 'em!

876
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:13,722
- Come on!
- Get off me, Charlie! Get off!

877
00:57:13,806 --> 00:57:16,392
- How do you like it, Banks?
- Yeah, nice takedown. You'd be in the box.

878
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:18,727
- Go cry to your rich parents!
- All right, fine!

879
00:57:21,272 --> 00:57:23,399
Come on, preppy!

880
00:57:23,524 --> 00:57:25,067
Hey, guys, wait for me!

881
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:33,159
Freeze!

882
00:57:33,826 --> 00:57:35,035
Hey!

883
00:57:35,578 --> 00:57:37,955
Hey! Break it up!

884
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:40,833
Whoa, whoa...

885
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:42,668
Break it up now! Hey!

886
00:57:45,004 --> 00:57:47,214
It's a damn good thing
I'm not your coach.

887
00:57:47,298 --> 00:57:48,883
Now, get your team out of here now!

888
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:51,510
Varsity team, out! Let's go!

889
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:55,473
Outta here! Let's go! You, out!

890
00:57:57,391 --> 00:57:59,685
- This ain't over.
- Get outta here.

891
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:05,608
- We're gonna destroy you guys.
- Come on, let it go.

892
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:07,860
Well, congratulations.

893
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:11,822
You just forfeited whatever mental edge
you might have had over the varsity.

894
00:58:11,906 --> 00:58:13,532
Now they know they own you.

895
00:58:15,242 --> 00:58:18,245
This isn't the Peewees. Your little Duck
tricks are not gonna work at this level.

896
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:23,334
Now, for the last time,
stay away from the varsity.

897
00:58:25,294 --> 00:58:27,254
And get those Duck jerseys off now.

898
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:28,380
Let's go.

899
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:31,008
Now. Come on, let's go. Take them off!

900
00:58:33,052 --> 00:58:34,637
The Ducks are dead.

901
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,185
You got two choices, Conway.

902
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:43,812
Take off the jersey right now
or you don't play.

903
00:58:47,274 --> 00:58:49,610
You're breaking up the best thing
any of us ever had.

904
00:58:50,069 --> 00:58:51,654
Well, it's time to grow up.

905
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:54,114
Grow up?

906
00:58:54,615 --> 00:58:55,950
Like you, huh?

907
00:58:57,493 --> 00:59:00,246
A washed-up pro who has to show off
to a bunch of kids.

908
00:59:00,913 --> 00:59:04,124
- Geez, that's real grown up.
- Okay, good-bye, Conway.

909
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:06,168
Anybody else?

910
00:59:11,757 --> 00:59:13,175
All right.

911
00:59:13,968 --> 00:59:15,511
Good-bye, Fulton.

912
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:20,849
No one's forcing any of you to be here.
It's your lives.

913
00:59:22,268 --> 00:59:23,936
You decide what to make of them.

914
00:59:32,444 --> 00:59:33,737
All right.

915
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:36,532
Twenty laps, then hit the showers.

916
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:51,213
<i>And with ten to go in the second,
it doesn't look good for Eden Hall.</i>

917
00:59:51,297 --> 00:59:53,132
<i>The one bright spot is Greg Goldberg,</i>

918
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,467
<i>who skates up on defense
for the first time tonight.</i>

919
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:57,636
<i>He's a one-man wrecking crew.</i>

920
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:00,055
Your mother's been calling.

921
01:00:00,472 --> 01:00:02,641
She's been looking for you.

922
01:00:02,725 --> 01:00:04,727
<i>These little Warriors
can't seem to buy a break.</i>

923
01:00:04,852 --> 01:00:06,228
I'm right here.

924
01:00:07,313 --> 01:00:09,523
<i>Ah, there's the buzzer.</i>

925
01:00:09,607 --> 01:00:11,609
<i>At the end of two,
it's the Cardinals four, the Warriors one.</i>

926
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:15,446
Sounds like the team needs you, huh?

927
01:00:15,863 --> 01:00:18,574
They don't need me.
What they need is a new coach.

928
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:21,410
You're not a little boy anymore, Charlie.

929
01:00:22,077 --> 01:00:23,662
Please stop acting this way.

930
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:26,248
I just don't know
what this guy wants from me.

931
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:29,752
He won't let you just skate by.

932
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:32,379
He demands more.

933
01:00:33,422 --> 01:00:36,550
He wants it because he knows
that it is there inside of you.

934
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,261
Like Gordon did.

935
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,764
He needs you to lead.

936
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:46,143
How can he expect me to lead
when he takes away my "C"?

937
01:00:46,769 --> 01:00:48,520
I was the captain, Hans.

938
01:00:49,813 --> 01:00:51,690
It's only a letter, Charlie.

939
01:00:54,193 --> 01:00:56,779
Here, I have hundreds.

940
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:59,657
These are not the same.

941
01:00:59,865 --> 01:01:01,533
Don't make fun of me, Hans.

942
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:04,953
He took away the "C," Charlie...

943
01:01:06,246 --> 01:01:07,748
not what was under it.

944
01:01:11,543 --> 01:01:12,670
Go.

945
01:01:14,797 --> 01:01:16,382
Be with your friends, Charlie.

946
01:01:18,217 --> 01:01:20,219
You are the heart of the team.

947
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,517
Don't let it slip away.

948
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:31,730
They're the ones that are
slipping away from me.

949
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:36,902
Are you okay, Hans?

950
01:01:43,617 --> 01:01:46,036
I gotta walk. I'll see you.

951
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:54,294
Good-bye, Charlie.

952
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,175
Hey, you're a winner there!
Get that big monkey outta here!

953
01:02:00,718 --> 01:02:02,261
All right, here we go.

954
01:02:03,262 --> 01:02:05,347
You boys playing a little
hookey today, huh?

955
01:02:05,723 --> 01:02:07,516
Oh, don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.

956
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:09,685
I played a lot of hookey
when I was your age.

957
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:12,855
Here we go. All right,
who needs balls, who needs tickets?

958
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:14,356
What do you say we do the coaster?

959
01:02:14,773 --> 01:02:16,984
Forget it, man. We're too old for that.

960
01:02:17,526 --> 01:02:19,319
Come on, man. It'll be fun.

961
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:22,197
All right.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart,

Igor Stravinsky, Thelonious Monk.

969
01:02:41,967 --> 01:02:44,011
You're gonna meet all of them... in here.

970
01:02:47,598 --> 01:02:49,266
Chocolate-dipped bananas.

971
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:51,643
- Oh, man!
- What can I get you?

972
01:02:51,894 --> 01:02:53,937
From their humble beginnings,
they rose to make a difference!

973
01:02:54,062 --> 01:02:55,898

984
01:03:26,512 --> 01:03:27,679
Come on.

985
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:29,890
Sure beats school, huh?

986
01:03:30,724 --> 01:03:32,476
Hey, listen, tomorrow will be more fun.

987
01:03:32,768 --> 01:03:35,062
Yeah, but after that, I mean, what?

988
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:37,105
- We can't do this forever.
- Yeah, I know.

989
01:03:37,189 --> 01:03:40,275
See, the way I got it figured, we go
to public school for a couple years,

990
01:03:40,359 --> 01:03:42,069
then we just go play Juniors in Canada.

991
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:43,237
You only gotta be 17.

992
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,280
Man, Charlie, I don't even know
if I could make Juniors.

993
01:03:45,948 --> 01:03:48,951
Are you kidding me?
With your shot? Come on.

994
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:54,623
I mean... I don't know if I want
to play hockey for the rest of my life.

995
01:03:57,793 --> 01:03:59,044
Sorry.

996
01:04:00,045 --> 01:04:01,421
You're going back.

997
01:04:02,965 --> 01:04:05,217
We can deal, man. The Ducks are there.

998
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:06,552
Dude.

999
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:09,471
Fine. Just get outta here then.

1000
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:12,057
I don't care.
I don't need you. Go!

1001
01:04:32,536 --> 01:04:33,579
Mom.

1002
01:04:40,586 --> 01:04:42,588
I've been trying to reach you.

1003
01:04:44,172 --> 01:04:46,550
Hans... passed away.

1004
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:48,802
What?

1005
01:04:49,136 --> 01:04:50,929
It was his time to go.

1006
01:04:57,978 --> 01:05:02,858
Our Father,
who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name.

1007
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:18,081
Forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive those who trespass against us.

1008
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:22,961
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

1009
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:27,466
For Thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory,

1010
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:30,677
forever and ever, amen.

1011
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:36,391
Excuse me, one second.

1012
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:55,035
Every time you touch the ice,

1013
01:05:56,244 --> 01:05:58,413
remember it was Hans who taught us to fly.

1014
01:06:35,742 --> 01:06:37,077
6:00 a.m.

1015
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:45,585
- I didn't even set the alarm.
- I did.

1016
01:06:46,795 --> 01:06:48,255
Good morning, Charlie.

1017
01:06:48,714 --> 01:06:51,675
Thought we'd spend the day together,
get an early start. Come on.

1018
01:06:52,718 --> 01:06:54,052
Go away.

1019
01:06:54,636 --> 01:06:56,179
Hans is gone, and I want to be alone.

1020
01:06:56,805 --> 01:06:59,933
Look, Charlie, I know you're going
through a rough time. I understand.

1021
01:07:00,267 --> 01:07:03,395
You know, not a day goes by that
I don't think about you and the Ducks.

1022
01:07:04,062 --> 01:07:05,564
There are no Ducks.

1023
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:07,566
Orion split us apart.

1024
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:10,360
You know, you left us with a real jerk.

1025
01:07:10,652 --> 01:07:11,987
Orion?

1026
01:07:12,654 --> 01:07:14,448
Well, maybe you don't
know the whole story.

1027
01:07:14,740 --> 01:07:16,116
Come on, get dressed. Let's go.

1028
01:07:17,325 --> 01:07:18,744
Go away.

1029
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:20,746
Can't do that. Come on.

1030
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:27,127
Get dressed, Charlie.

1031
01:07:30,172 --> 01:07:33,091
What is this all about?

1032
01:07:33,175 --> 01:07:35,886
Sit down.

1033
01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:50,942
That's his daughter.

1034
01:07:54,237 --> 01:07:56,990
She was injured in a car accident
about five years ago.

1035
01:07:57,574 --> 01:07:59,785
He was driving, and they got sideswiped.

1036
01:08:04,706 --> 01:08:06,708
So that's why he gave up playing pros?

1037
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:09,586
When the North Stars left Minnesota,
he stayed.

1038
01:08:10,337 --> 01:08:12,214
He didn't want to disrupt her recovery.

1039
01:08:12,297 --> 01:08:14,382
Her doctors and her friends were here.

1040
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:29,856
We all just thought he was some
washed-up bully who couldn't hack it.

1041
01:08:30,315 --> 01:08:31,733
He can hack it, Charlie.

1042
01:08:33,777 --> 01:08:35,779
He just simply made a choice.

1043
01:08:36,738 --> 01:08:39,199
I don't think he's ever
regretted it for a minute.

1044
01:08:45,956 --> 01:08:47,165
Come on.

1045
01:08:51,837 --> 01:08:53,046
Check this out.

1046
01:08:54,673 --> 01:08:56,007
Look at that hair.

1047
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:58,301
I look like Greg Brady.

1048
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:04,683
I was like you, Charlie.

1049
01:09:06,143 --> 01:09:08,311
When I played hockey,
I was a total hotshot.

1050
01:09:08,395 --> 01:09:10,105
Tried to take control of every game.

1051
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:12,232
I wound up quitting.

1052
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:14,192
So I tried the law.

1053
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:15,694
Same thing.

1054
01:09:16,236 --> 01:09:18,530
I rule in the courtroom,
but inside I'm a mess.

1055
01:09:19,739 --> 01:09:20,991
I started drinking.

1056
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:23,243
Man, I was going down.

1057
01:09:23,702 --> 01:09:24,911
But then this...

1058
01:09:25,579 --> 01:09:27,205
great thing happened.

1059
01:09:28,874 --> 01:09:30,458
Maybe the best thing ever.

1060
01:09:32,127 --> 01:09:33,503
I got arrested...

1061
01:09:34,629 --> 01:09:36,590
and sentenced to community service.

1062
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:39,551
And there you were,

1063
01:09:40,635 --> 01:09:42,304
Charlie and the Ducks.

1064
01:09:43,638 --> 01:09:45,432
And as hard as I fought it,

1065
01:09:48,018 --> 01:09:49,477
there you were.

1066
01:09:51,897 --> 01:09:53,440
You gave me a life, Charlie.

1067
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:56,985
And I want to say thank you.

1068
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:04,951
I told Orion about all this
when I talked to him about taking over.

1069
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:10,040
I told him that you were
the heart of the team...

1070
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:13,585
and that you would learn
something from each other.

1071
01:10:15,629 --> 01:10:17,047
I told him...

1072
01:10:17,631 --> 01:10:20,300
that you were
the real Minnesota miracle man.

1073
01:10:25,472 --> 01:10:26,973
You did?

1074
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:29,517
I did.

1075
01:10:31,686 --> 01:10:33,480
So be that man, Charlie.

1076
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:38,151
Be that man.

1077
01:10:51,998 --> 01:10:54,459
Hey, nice move!

1078
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:57,170
- Hey, on your left.
- There they are.

1079
01:10:57,254 --> 01:10:59,589
That doesn't count.
That was below the belt.

1080
01:11:00,757 --> 01:11:02,008
Same old Ducks.

1081
01:11:02,425 --> 01:11:04,552
- Nothing's changed, Charlie.
- Hey, it's Coach Bombay!

1082
01:11:04,678 --> 01:11:06,972
- Damn, Conway, what took you so long?
- Come on!

1083
01:11:07,055 --> 01:11:09,057
- Get in the game!
- Yeah, come on, Coach!

1084
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:11,268
- Come on, guys, let's go!
- Come on.

1085
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:17,274
Yeah, come on, let's go!

1086
01:11:17,357 --> 01:11:19,359
- Let's go!
- All right! Yes!

Fulton.

1101
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:25,842
Conway?

1102
01:12:28,428 --> 01:12:30,221
I want to be on the team, Coach.

1103
01:12:31,264 --> 01:12:32,891
I want to play two-way hockey.

1104
01:12:35,727 --> 01:12:37,145
Can I come back?

1105
01:12:39,064 --> 01:12:40,523
Take a seat. We're running late.

1106
01:12:40,607 --> 01:12:43,109
Let's go. We got a game to catch.

1107
01:12:43,193 --> 01:12:46,112
It's about time, Conway.

1108
01:12:46,196 --> 01:12:47,322
Welcome back, baby!

1109
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:48,448
- Welcome back!
- Yes!

1110
01:12:48,531 --> 01:12:50,033
Crank her up, Mr. Bus Man!

1111
01:12:50,116 --> 01:12:52,035
Oh, man, you should have seen your face.

1112
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:54,871
"Oh, Coach, I want to play two-way
hockey. Can I come back?"

1113
01:12:54,954 --> 01:12:57,165
Ow!

1114
01:12:58,333 --> 01:12:59,793
I almost missed you.

1115
01:13:00,043 --> 01:13:02,087
Coach, you mind if I have
a few words with your boys?

1116
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:03,380
And girls.

1117
01:13:03,463 --> 01:13:06,091
Yes, of course. And girls.

1118
01:13:06,174 --> 01:13:08,176
If you can make it quick, Dean.
We're running late as it is.

1119
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:09,886
I'm afraid this is important.

1120
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:13,515
We have a board meeting
scheduled tomorrow, and...

1121
01:13:14,099 --> 01:13:16,226
well, you all are on the agenda.

1122
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:18,353
We have to think long-term here.

1123
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,647
What's in your best interest.

1124
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:24,025
Hard as it is for me personally,

1125
01:13:24,109 --> 01:13:27,028
because you kids have been a breath
of fresh air around here,

1126
01:13:27,737 --> 01:13:31,741
the board is going to approve
the withdrawal of your scholarships.

1127
01:13:32,784 --> 01:13:35,703
Now, you'll be welcome to stay
through the end of the semester,

1128
01:13:35,829 --> 01:13:37,831
but after that,
it will be necessary for you

1129
01:13:37,914 --> 01:13:41,209
to enjoy other educational opportunities.

1130
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:44,003
- Dean, I need a word with you.
- I think I've said all I need to say.

1131
01:13:44,129 --> 01:13:45,463
No, now.

1132
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:49,092
"Other educational opportunities"?

1133
01:13:49,843 --> 01:13:51,428
What's he saying, Russ?

1134
01:13:52,512 --> 01:13:54,431
I'll put it in terms you can understand.

1135
01:13:55,181 --> 01:13:58,518
<i>- Adios, amigo.</i>
- <i>"Adios, amigo."</i>

1136
01:13:58,977 --> 01:14:01,020
Oh. I see.

1137
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:06,359
So that's it?
You're dumping 'em, just like that?

1138
01:14:06,443 --> 01:14:07,694
Coach, I'm sorry.

1139
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:10,572
Your team isn't performing,
and I've been under enormous pressure.

1140
01:14:10,655 --> 01:14:12,574
From whom? The alumni group?

1141
01:14:12,657 --> 01:14:13,992
A bunch of aging pep clubbers?

1142
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:16,828
Ted, I'm trying to do you a favor.

1143
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:19,664
With those kids gone,
you'll get to pick your own team.

1144
01:14:19,747 --> 01:14:22,167
Let's face it, the Ducks are drowning.

1145
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:26,421
I got my team.

1146
01:14:27,172 --> 01:14:29,466
Either they stay or I go.

1147
01:14:33,428 --> 01:14:34,762
We'll miss you, Ted.

1148
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:40,852
- Why us?
- 'Cause he's a slime.

1149
01:14:41,019 --> 01:14:42,562
Yeah, I know
where that dude lives.

1150
01:14:42,896 --> 01:14:44,230
We're just pawns,

1151
01:14:45,064 --> 01:14:46,483
puppets for the stage show,

1152
01:14:46,566 --> 01:14:48,693
jesters to entertain the king,
barnacles on the bottom of...

1153
01:14:48,776 --> 01:14:50,153
Shut up!

1154
01:14:50,987 --> 01:14:52,530
Coach, is this legal?

1155
01:14:52,697 --> 01:14:54,782
I mean, don't we have
contracts or something?

1156
01:14:54,866 --> 01:14:56,493
I don't know what it is.

1157
01:14:58,036 --> 01:14:59,954
All I know is we're gonna fight it.

1158
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:03,875
Do I have a motion for reconsideration?

1159
01:15:11,883 --> 01:15:14,302
I'm sorry, Coach, but unless there is a...

1160
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:16,679
motion from a board member and a second,

1161
01:15:16,763 --> 01:15:18,389
the decision must stand.

1162
01:15:18,598 --> 01:15:19,807
Told you not to worry.

1163
01:15:20,058 --> 01:15:23,478
You leave us no choice
but to bring in our attorney.

1164
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:25,605
Please.

1165
01:15:29,484 --> 01:15:31,361
Dean Buckley, members of the board.

1166
01:15:31,903 --> 01:15:34,113
As counsel for Coach Orion...

1167
01:15:34,822 --> 01:15:36,658
and the freshman hockey team,

1168
01:15:36,741 --> 01:15:38,660
I'm here today to set forth
your legal options,

1169
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:42,497
so that you may make the best possible
decision for all parties concerned.

1170
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:46,000
Mr. Bombay, this isn't a legal proceeding.

1171
01:15:46,626 --> 01:15:49,420
Not yet, but I can assure you
that it will be.

1172
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:53,591
Do you mind?

1173
01:15:56,177 --> 01:15:57,887
These scholarships...

1174
01:15:58,596 --> 01:16:00,014
an offer...

1175
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:04,811
became a binding contract upon
the signatures of the recipients...

1176
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:07,564
and acceptance by the Ducks.

1177
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:11,651
They cannot be voided except for cause
which, I guarantee you, you have none.

1178
01:16:11,943 --> 01:16:14,195
Should you decide to pursue
their cancellation,

1179
01:16:15,113 --> 01:16:16,447
I will slap you with an injunction.

1180
01:16:16,531 --> 01:16:18,950
I will tie this matter up
in court for years,

1181
01:16:19,033 --> 01:16:21,744
until long after these kids
have gone on to college.

1182
01:16:22,537 --> 01:16:24,289
And I will collect damages.

1183
01:16:25,456 --> 01:16:26,833
I will win.

1184
01:16:29,043 --> 01:16:32,088
Because I am very, very good.

1185
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,049
You know why I'm so good?

1186
01:16:36,217 --> 01:16:37,802
Because I had a good education.

1187
01:16:38,886 --> 01:16:40,221
You gave it to me.

1188
01:16:40,888 --> 01:16:42,307
And you're gonna give it to these kids.

1189
01:16:44,726 --> 01:16:45,768
He is good.

1190
01:16:46,561 --> 01:16:48,229
Just gettin' started.

1191
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:51,399
Now some of you may be snobbish enough
to believe that

1192
01:16:51,482 --> 01:16:53,401
these Ducks don't belong at Eden Hall.

1193
01:16:54,861 --> 01:16:57,447
Let me tell you, you are dead wrong.

1194
01:16:59,282 --> 01:17:01,242
These are remarkable young people.

1195
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:04,662
You give them their full shot,

1196
01:17:05,038 --> 01:17:07,373
and I promise you they will succeed,
not only on the ice,

1197
01:17:08,625 --> 01:17:10,251
but in the classrooms as well.

1198
01:17:12,253 --> 01:17:13,921
These people are my friends,

1199
01:17:14,505 --> 01:17:16,049
and I know what they can do.

1200
01:17:19,927 --> 01:17:21,179
Accordingly,

1201
01:17:22,013 --> 01:17:23,806
I demand that you reinstate
their scholarships,

1202
01:17:23,931 --> 01:17:25,141
for their benefit...

1203
01:17:25,516 --> 01:17:26,851
and for your own.

1204
01:17:37,779 --> 01:17:39,614
This is ridiculous. Really.

1205
01:17:42,492 --> 01:17:43,743
What's going on, man?

1206
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:47,288
I move that the scholarships...

1207
01:17:47,372 --> 01:17:49,207
be reinstated.

1208
01:17:52,293 --> 01:17:53,461
Is there a second?

1209
01:17:55,963 --> 01:17:57,340
All in favor?

1210
01:17:58,091 --> 01:17:59,384
We have no choice.

1211
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,514
Scholarships reinstated.

1212
01:18:11,688 --> 01:18:12,980
For Hans, Charlie.

1213
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:20,071
I've got some business in Chicago,
but I'll be back soon.

1214
01:18:20,154 --> 01:18:22,073
- If you need anything, give me a call.
- All right.

1215
01:18:22,156 --> 01:18:23,366
Okay? I mean it.

1216
01:18:23,491 --> 01:18:24,992
Yeah. Thanks again, Coach.

1217
01:18:25,118 --> 01:18:26,369
All right.

1218
01:18:27,328 --> 01:18:28,788
- See you later.
- See you.

1219
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:30,164
Hi, Charlie.

1220
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:31,624
Hey.

1221
01:18:32,333 --> 01:18:34,210
Listen, I'm sorry I was such a jerk,

1222
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:36,170
but... I'm staying in school.

1223
01:18:36,337 --> 01:18:39,424
- And I still owe you that Coke.
- I'm just glad you're back.

1224
01:18:39,507 --> 01:18:42,593
Congratulations...
in destroying our school.

1225
01:18:42,677 --> 01:18:46,180
- Hey, look, it's our school too.
- It's everyone's school, you stupid jock.

1226
01:18:46,264 --> 01:18:48,891
No, it'll never be your school.
Don't you get it?

1227
01:18:49,267 --> 01:18:52,520
You're our own little affirmative action,
brought in for color to entertain us.

1228
01:18:52,603 --> 01:18:54,105
But you couldn't even do that.

1229
01:18:54,188 --> 01:18:56,774
Your fancy lawyer kept you in
on a technicality,

1230
01:18:57,066 --> 01:19:00,069
- but you'll never belong.
- You'll never be anything more

1231
01:19:00,153 --> 01:19:02,697
than a bunch of rejects
here on a free ride.

1232
01:19:02,864 --> 01:19:05,742
Free ride? Look at you, rich boy!

1233
01:19:05,867 --> 01:19:08,035
Mummy and Daddy
gave you everything, huh?

1234
01:19:08,161 --> 01:19:09,996
Hey, J.V.-Varsity game's on Friday.

1235
01:19:10,121 --> 01:19:12,832
Then we'll show the whole school
what a joke you really are.

1236
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:14,625
Then maybe you'll leave on your own.

1237
01:19:15,084 --> 01:19:17,837
It'd be... the only honorable thing to do.

1238
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:21,382
You know we're gonna hurt you.

1239
01:19:21,591 --> 01:19:26,012
Listen, you guys had
an unfair advantage last time.

1240
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:28,431
Banksie.

1241
01:19:29,056 --> 01:19:30,349
Oh, well, keep him.

1242
01:19:30,433 --> 01:19:32,685
He never
had the heart of a Warrior anyway.

1243
01:19:33,394 --> 01:19:35,688
Hey, Biff, one more thing.

1244
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:40,276
After we beat you,
the Warriors die and the Ducks fly.

1245
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:43,154
Hey, anything you say, loser. Hmm?

1246
01:19:43,529 --> 01:19:45,531
Jerks.

1247
01:19:45,823 --> 01:19:48,242
Good move, Russ.
Make 'em even madder.

1248
01:19:48,493 --> 01:19:50,495
Charlie, we gotta do something, man.

1249
01:19:50,703 --> 01:19:51,996
Yeah, you're right.

1250
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:53,664
We've gotta get to work.

1251
01:19:58,085 --> 01:20:00,004
Let's go, guys! Pick it up!

1252
01:20:03,341 --> 01:20:05,259
All right, I've been doing
my homework on the varsity.

1253
01:20:05,343 --> 01:20:07,595
I'm not gonna lie to you, they're good.

1254
01:20:07,678 --> 01:20:10,306
The way they wiped your faces
in the dirt last time was no fluke.

1255
01:20:11,641 --> 01:20:14,268
<i>So if you want your pride back,
you better be willing to work.</i>

1256
01:20:14,352 --> 01:20:15,603
One, two...

1257
01:20:15,686 --> 01:20:16,979
<i>There's nothing glamorous about it.</i>

1258
01:20:17,063 --> 01:20:18,731
<i>In the pros,
we call it blue-collar hockey.</i>

1259
01:20:18,815 --> 01:20:21,150
<i>Now there's one thing
the varsity does very well.</i>

1260
01:20:21,234 --> 01:20:23,194
They're vultures around the net.

1261
01:20:23,528 --> 01:20:26,113
They pick up every piece of loose trash.

1262
01:20:26,197 --> 01:20:27,281
That's how they beat you.

1263
01:20:27,365 --> 01:20:29,450
Not with the first shot;
the second and the third.

1264
01:20:29,826 --> 01:20:32,578
They bang in the junk.
So if you wanna win,

1265
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:36,040
you're gonna have to pick up the trash.

1266
01:20:39,669 --> 01:20:41,128
Whew, man.

1267
01:20:43,089 --> 01:20:44,423
Have any cream cheese?

1268
01:20:44,674 --> 01:20:47,385
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1269
01:20:47,468 --> 01:20:49,512
Come on! Who's that?
Who's that?

1270
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:53,641
- Come on, come on!
- Clear the bagel out!

1271
01:20:54,517 --> 01:20:56,561
Who's there? Who's there?

1272
01:20:57,395 --> 01:20:59,438
Julie the Cat, nice save!
Here we go!

1273
01:20:59,522 --> 01:21:01,148
Get down, guys. All right.

1274
01:21:02,483 --> 01:21:05,069
Come on! Throw that garbage in there!

1275
01:21:05,194 --> 01:21:08,114
Yes! Whoo!

1276
01:21:11,868 --> 01:21:13,744
All right, looks like
this place is pretty clean.

1277
01:21:13,828 --> 01:21:15,580
Get up, get up!
Come on! On the net!

1278
01:21:15,663 --> 01:21:17,915
The crease is yours! Let's go!

1279
01:21:18,666 --> 01:21:20,459
Let's go! Get over here!

1280
01:21:20,626 --> 01:21:22,044
Grab a knee!

1281
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:26,048
You guys are not skating like Warriors!

1282
01:21:30,052 --> 01:21:31,512
You look like something else.

1283
01:21:31,971 --> 01:21:33,055
Huh?

1284
01:21:38,936 --> 01:21:40,563
You look like Ducks.

1285
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:44,650
Robertson.

1286
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:50,948
All right! Check it out!

1287
01:21:52,074 --> 01:21:54,243
<i>Quack, quack, quack, quack.</i>

1288
01:21:54,327 --> 01:21:58,247
<i>Quack, quack, quack, quack.
Quack, quack, quack, quack.</i>

1289
01:21:58,331 --> 01:22:01,584
<i>Quack, quack, quack, quack.
Quack, quack, quack, quack.</i>

1290
01:22:01,709 --> 01:22:06,297
Quack, quack, quack...

1291
01:22:07,381 --> 01:22:09,717
- Buckley. Good to see you.
- Tom.

1292
01:22:10,593 --> 01:22:13,304
<i>Fasten your seat belts
and hold onto your hats, everyone.</i>

1293
01:22:13,387 --> 01:22:16,140
<i>Oh, do we have
a special showdown for you.</i>

1294
01:22:16,223 --> 01:22:18,768
<i>David versus Goliath
in a titanic grudge match.</i>

1295
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:22,605
<i>The winner can truly say
that he is the symbol of Eden Hall.</i>

1296
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:29,320
Tonight the Eden Hall varsity Warriors

1297
01:22:29,403 --> 01:22:31,405
do battle with the Eden Hall
freshman Ducks.

1298
01:22:31,489 --> 01:22:33,407
That's right, folks,
look at those uniforms.

1299
01:22:33,491 --> 01:22:36,077
<i>The sign of the Duck is here
at Eden Hall for at least one night.</i>

1300
01:22:38,204 --> 01:22:39,664
This is for Hans.

1301
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:03,688
<i>It appears they're paying homage
to their departed friend and mentor, Hans.</i>

1302
01:23:03,771 --> 01:23:06,190
The touching of the ice is
a Norwegian symbol of respect.

1303
01:23:08,359 --> 01:23:11,862
They don't belong on our ice.
They don't belong in our school.

1304
01:23:11,946 --> 01:23:15,074
Now show 'em why. Let's go, gentlemen!

1305
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:18,119
All right, let's go hunting
for goose eggs, huh?

1306
01:23:18,285 --> 01:23:19,620
Come on, hands in.

1307
01:23:19,704 --> 01:23:21,455
On three...

1308
01:23:21,706 --> 01:23:23,165
"Quack."

1309
01:23:25,459 --> 01:23:27,545
One, two, three.

1310
01:23:27,628 --> 01:23:29,755
<i>Quack, quack, quack...</i>

1311
01:23:29,839 --> 01:23:32,842
<i>Quack, quack, quack...</i>

1312
01:23:33,009 --> 01:23:37,972
<i>Quack, quack, quack...</i>

1313
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:45,396
The Ducks, Tom. Quack, quack.

1314
01:23:45,563 --> 01:23:47,773
Go, Ducks!

1315
01:23:47,857 --> 01:23:49,150
Come on now!

1316
01:23:55,322 --> 01:23:56,532
All right!

1317
01:23:59,493 --> 01:24:00,661
Bring it on!

1318
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:05,958
You're gonna wish like hell
you stuck with us.

1319
01:24:06,083 --> 01:24:07,543
Save the trash talk.

1320
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:14,216
Okay, boys, let's go. Sticks on the ice.

1321
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:18,387
<i>The puck is dropped, and
here we go. Ooh, Varsity comes out hard.</i>

1322
01:24:23,059 --> 01:24:25,644
<i>Ooh! Big save by Julie the Cat!</i>

1323
01:24:26,103 --> 01:24:28,731
<i>At this rate, it's gonna take a miracle
for the Ducks to hang on.</i>

1324
01:24:35,571 --> 01:24:38,991
<i>Goldberg, spectacular toe save,
as the Ducks are playing real defense.</i>

1325
01:24:39,075 --> 01:24:40,618
Get off of me!

1326
01:24:40,701 --> 01:24:43,412
Ooh! Good one! Yeah!

1327
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:47,333
- Fulton, change it!
- Let's go!

1328
01:24:48,084 --> 01:24:49,960
All right! Go, Julie!

1329
01:24:54,131 --> 01:24:56,967
- Why'd you come back?
- Unfinished business.

1330
01:24:57,718 --> 01:24:59,136
We'll finish it for you.

1331
01:24:59,762 --> 01:25:01,972
Go!

1332
01:25:16,946 --> 01:25:19,782
I'm gonna stand you up!

1333
01:25:30,501 --> 01:25:31,794
<i>Warriors are swarming.</i>

1334
01:25:32,962 --> 01:25:36,757
<i>Gaffney comes up big again!
Conway gets the rebound...</i>

1335
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,218
<i>and ices the puck.</i>

1336
01:25:39,301 --> 01:25:42,096
<i>I don't know how much longer
these Ducks can hang on.</i>

1337
01:25:48,936 --> 01:25:50,354
Way to hang tough.

1338
01:25:52,815 --> 01:25:55,359
These guys keep charging.
What are we gonna do here?

1339
01:25:55,860 --> 01:25:57,361
We gotta stand up to them.

1340
01:25:57,444 --> 01:25:58,821
Play a little defense.

1341
01:25:59,155 --> 01:26:00,906
All right? Let's go!

1342
01:26:11,208 --> 01:26:13,002
Clear the puck! Come on!

1343
01:26:13,085 --> 01:26:15,880
Clear the puck! Get with it, defense!

1344
01:26:15,963 --> 01:26:17,840
<i>It's Goldberg,
Germaine and Averman.</i>

1345
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:19,216
<i>Everyone's getting into the act now.</i>

1346
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:21,010
<i>They're clearing out the garbage
in front of the net.</i>

1347
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:22,094
Good get!

1348
01:26:22,178 --> 01:26:24,430
<i>They aren't gonna allow
any cheap goals tonight.</i>

1349
01:26:29,226 --> 01:26:33,063
<i>First shot on the varsity goalie.
Save! Ah, he came up big.</i>

1350
01:26:50,206 --> 01:26:53,125
Ooh, close one.

1351
01:26:54,418 --> 01:26:57,046
- Nice save, Catlady.
- Thanks, Goldberg.

1352
01:26:57,379 --> 01:26:58,964
Just pickin' up the trash.

1353
01:27:00,090 --> 01:27:02,760
Let's go! Come on, come on!

1354
01:27:02,885 --> 01:27:04,970
Come on, guys!
Pick it up, pick it up!

1355
01:27:08,182 --> 01:27:10,392
Pick up the hitting now!

1356
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:25,115
<i>Well, if you can't beat 'em, beat 'em.</i>

1357
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:26,450
<i>That seems to be Wilson's message</i>

1358
01:27:26,533 --> 01:27:28,994
<i>because the varsity
is really nailing the Ducks now.</i>

1359
01:27:29,119 --> 01:27:30,704
Come on!

1360
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,168
Whoa!

1361
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:38,170
Come on!

1362
01:27:43,968 --> 01:27:45,719
What?

1363
01:27:46,095 --> 01:27:47,721
It's a game of hitting,
game of hitting. Come on.

1364
01:27:47,805 --> 01:27:49,348
Come on! Let's go!

1365
01:27:54,687 --> 01:27:56,063
Now I resent that.

1366
01:28:01,402 --> 01:28:03,779
Whoa, Les Averman just got levelled.
He must be seeing stars.

1367
01:28:03,862 --> 01:28:05,030
Oh, my God.

1368
01:28:05,155 --> 01:28:07,825
Ah, it's so pretty up there.

1369
01:28:07,908 --> 01:28:09,952
- Way to stand strong, buddy.
- Hi, Coach.

1370
01:28:10,035 --> 01:28:11,495
Okay, son. Come on, have a seat.

1371
01:28:11,662 --> 01:28:13,622
Keep hitting, they'll break.

1372
01:28:14,581 --> 01:28:16,959
Watch yourselves, Ducks.
They're head-hunting, huh?

1373
01:28:17,126 --> 01:28:19,795
- Fulton, Goldberg, change it up!
- Go get 'em!

1374
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:22,548
<i>Orion sends out Fulton
and their new defensive weapon, Goldberg.</i>

1375
01:28:33,517 --> 01:28:34,810
Oh, no.

1376
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:42,609
<i>Huge save by Gaffney.</i>

1377
01:28:42,735 --> 01:28:44,653
<i>She got caught out of the net,
but she scrambled back in</i>

1378
01:28:44,737 --> 01:28:45,988
just in the nick of time.

1379
01:28:46,071 --> 01:28:47,740
Nice save, Julie the Cat!

1380
01:28:47,823 --> 01:28:49,658
She's an "A" student too.

1381
01:28:58,667 --> 01:28:59,752
Come on!

1382
01:29:00,544 --> 01:29:02,129
Well, blow something, ref! Come on!

1383
01:29:02,212 --> 01:29:03,464
Oh, now this is getting out of hand.

1384
01:29:03,547 --> 01:29:05,632
Guy Germaine just took a vicious check
into the boards.

1385
01:29:05,716 --> 01:29:07,301
He's down, and he's not getting up.

1386
01:29:07,384 --> 01:29:10,346
- Let's go.
- You'll be all right, partner.

1387
01:29:10,429 --> 01:29:12,014
You're okay. You're okay.

1388
01:29:15,684 --> 01:29:18,270
Okay, Guy, just stay down there
for a second.

1389
01:29:18,729 --> 01:29:20,189
Oh, my...

1390
01:29:20,898 --> 01:29:22,524
It's okay. Back up, guys.
Give him some room.

1391
01:29:22,608 --> 01:29:25,235
- You okay?
- I'm okay. Here, I can skate.

1392
01:29:25,319 --> 01:29:27,988
That's hockey.

1393
01:29:29,948 --> 01:29:32,409
You're all right, Guy.
You'll get 'em back. Yeah.

1394
01:29:48,717 --> 01:29:49,885
Get him, get him!

1395
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:52,471
<i>Conway on the breakaway!
He's all alone!</i>

1396
01:29:52,971 --> 01:29:55,182
Come on, Charlie.

1397
01:29:59,228 --> 01:30:02,564
Oh, beat by the buzzer.

1398
01:30:02,648 --> 01:30:04,650
<i>Two periods done,
it's still no score.</i>

1399
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:07,277
<i>You really gotta wonder how much longer
the freshman can take this pounding.</i>

1400
01:30:08,404 --> 01:30:11,031
Okay, and now, it's a great pleasure
to introduce

1401
01:30:11,156 --> 01:30:13,283
our special, surprise,
in-between-period guest,

1402
01:30:13,367 --> 01:30:14,743
from the Anaheim Mighty Ducks

1403
01:30:14,827 --> 01:30:16,703
and visiting friends
in the Twin Cities area,

1404
01:30:16,787 --> 01:30:18,330
N.H.L. sensation Paul Kariya.

1405
01:30:18,414 --> 01:30:19,540
Paul, thanks for being here.

1406
01:30:19,623 --> 01:30:21,250
Thanks, Josh.
It's great to be in Minnesota.

1407
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:22,876
So what do you think of the game so far?

1408
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:25,254
The Ducks are playing their hearts out,
but they've got to find a way to score.

1409
01:30:25,337 --> 01:30:27,881
Yeah, it's gonna be tough.
This varsity team is big and brutal.

1410
01:30:27,965 --> 01:30:29,925
Size isn't everything in hockey, Josh.

1411
01:30:30,008 --> 01:30:31,927
The Ducks have the speed
and the determination.

1412
01:30:32,010 --> 01:30:34,388
- It's gonna be quite a third period.
- Good point, Paul.

1413
01:30:34,471 --> 01:30:36,557
So what do you think Coach Orion's
saying in the locker room?

1414
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:38,725
You're playing hard.
I'm proud of you guys.

1415
01:30:39,309 --> 01:30:40,686
They're cheap-shooting us to death,
Coach.

1416
01:30:40,769 --> 01:30:42,396
I know they are. I know they are.

1417
01:30:42,563 --> 01:30:44,273
It's gonna take a miracle
for us to hold on.

1418
01:30:45,607 --> 01:30:47,151
"Dean Portman is awarded a full

1419
01:30:47,234 --> 01:30:50,237
athletic and academic scholarship
to the Eden Hall Academy."

1420
01:30:50,446 --> 01:30:52,573
I had this lying around
the house in Chicago.

1421
01:30:52,656 --> 01:30:54,575
My attorney thought I should sign it.
I agreed.

1422
01:30:54,658 --> 01:30:56,285
It's official, boys! I'm back!

1423
01:31:01,206 --> 01:31:02,040
Bombay.

1424
01:31:04,334 --> 01:31:06,170
Let's go dance on their skulls!

1425
01:31:06,253 --> 01:31:08,755
Here we go into the third period
of a well-fought battle.

1426
01:31:08,922 --> 01:31:10,424
Oh, look, here come the Ducks.

1427
01:31:10,549 --> 01:31:12,718
<i>Hey, wait a second.
Isn't that Dean Portman?</i>

1428
01:31:12,801 --> 01:31:14,720
<i>Hey, it looks like
the other Bash Brother is back,</i>

1429
01:31:14,803 --> 01:31:17,097
<i>and he's brought the Ducks
a renewed spirit.</i>

1430
01:31:22,978 --> 01:31:24,771
<i>Dean Portman hasn't skated
for a while,</i>

1431
01:31:24,897 --> 01:31:26,899
<i>but he's known more
for his enforcer skills.</i>

1432
01:31:26,982 --> 01:31:29,276
Who is that kid? He can't play.

1433
01:31:29,735 --> 01:31:32,070
The kid's got a contract, Tom.
My hands are tied.

1434
01:31:32,738 --> 01:31:35,991
Look, it's the other
Bash Brother.

1435
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:38,368
Ooh, I'm really shakin' now.

1436
01:31:39,161 --> 01:31:41,914
So you're the big enforcer, huh?
It's nice to meet you.

1437
01:31:42,247 --> 01:31:44,208
- You know, we got something in common...
- Shut up!

1438
01:31:46,126 --> 01:31:47,377
Let's play hockey.

1439
01:31:47,461 --> 01:31:49,505
Whatever you say, sunshine.

1440
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:53,217
Gentlemen, let's have
a good period of hockey.

1441
01:31:56,386 --> 01:31:58,180
Let's see what you got, Bash Brother.

1442
01:32:01,725 --> 01:32:04,978
Oh, my! What a hit!

1443
01:32:10,984 --> 01:32:12,778
Come on, Wilson! Get...

1444
01:32:23,038 --> 01:32:24,706
Now that's clearing the garbage.

1445
01:32:24,790 --> 01:32:26,250
Hey, man, we're just getting warmed up.

1446
01:32:29,169 --> 01:32:32,589
Oh, yeah, you like
that, huh? Come on, here you go.

1447
01:32:32,714 --> 01:32:35,759
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the Bash Brothers are here to stay.</i>

1448
01:32:39,179 --> 01:32:41,807
Yeah! Whoo!

1449
01:32:42,558 --> 01:32:45,519
<i>This is more like it. The Ducks
are finally starting to dish it out.</i>

1450
01:32:45,644 --> 01:32:47,896
Look at Portman, Fulton and Goldberg!

1451
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:50,899
Oh, the Bash Brothers
are really going to town.

1452
01:32:51,108 --> 01:32:53,735
Yeah!

1453
01:32:54,861 --> 01:32:56,071
It's a legal check.

1454
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:58,115
All right, you guys, work!

1455
01:33:04,580 --> 01:33:06,707
- <i>Here come the Ducks on a break.</i>
- Pass it, Guy!

1456
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:08,208
<i>Germaine passes to Averman.</i>

1457
01:33:09,042 --> 01:33:12,296
<i>Averman fakes, tosses back
to Mendoza! Shoots! Saves!</i>

1458
01:33:12,379 --> 01:33:14,006
Oh, no, not again!

1459
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:21,096
All right, change it up!

1460
01:33:21,179 --> 01:33:23,098
Let's go, let's go!
Come on, hurry, hurry, hurry!

1461
01:33:26,435 --> 01:33:28,687
Ah, come on!

1462
01:33:28,812 --> 01:33:30,814
- Get up, man. Get up.
- I didn't do anything...

1463
01:33:30,981 --> 01:33:33,317
21 white, two minutes, hooking.

1464
01:33:33,984 --> 01:33:35,944
- Come on, ref!
- What kind of call was that?

1465
01:33:36,069 --> 01:33:37,654
- Give me a break. I didn't do anything.
- Let's go, son.

1466
01:33:37,738 --> 01:33:40,032
- That's a dive!
- Come on, ref!

1467
01:33:42,159 --> 01:33:45,662
All right then, do you want to see
a penalty? I'll show you a real penalty.

1468
01:33:45,746 --> 01:33:47,372
Get outta my face, man. What the...

1469
01:33:48,707 --> 01:33:50,083
Ref, give me a break. That's a dive.

1470
01:33:50,167 --> 01:33:52,502
What are you talking about? Oh, please.

1471
01:33:53,170 --> 01:33:54,546
Yeah!

1472
01:34:05,098 --> 01:34:09,227
- Shake it all up, baby!
- Hubba, hubba, hubba!

1473
01:34:13,607 --> 01:34:17,027
Charlie, don't give up, man!
They ain't that tough!

1474
01:34:20,072 --> 01:34:22,282
<i>This is insanity. Dean Portman is...</i>

1475
01:34:22,366 --> 01:34:24,618
He's stripping in the penalty box!

1476
01:34:24,743 --> 01:34:28,372
Oh, he has really got this crowd,
especially the ladies going.

1477
01:34:28,622 --> 01:34:29,998
Yeah!

1478
01:34:35,128 --> 01:34:38,465
- Yeah!
- He's taking a dance class, Tom.

1479
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:41,760
- Change it.
- Let's go, guys. Come on.

1480
01:34:41,968 --> 01:34:44,638
- Too many men, ref! Too many men!
- Too many!

1481
01:34:45,514 --> 01:34:47,349
White, you got a bench.

1482
01:34:47,432 --> 01:34:49,559
- Bench minor. Too many men on the ice.
- All right, Luis!

1483
01:34:49,643 --> 01:34:50,977
Put a man in the box.

1484
01:34:51,061 --> 01:34:52,729
Luis, back on the bench!
Wu, go to the box!

1485
01:34:52,813 --> 01:34:54,064
<i>Oh, this is bad, folks.</i>

1486
01:34:54,147 --> 01:34:56,233
Ken Wu jumped off the bench
a little too early,

1487
01:34:56,316 --> 01:34:58,068
and now the Ducks will have
to skate two men down.

1488
01:34:58,151 --> 01:34:59,069
All right, time out!

1489
01:34:59,152 --> 01:35:00,987
Time out!

1490
01:35:01,071 --> 01:35:02,989
Five on three.
We're never gonna make it.

1491
01:35:03,198 --> 01:35:07,411
It's cool little Bash Brother. We can
hold 'em, man. Don't give up. Let's go.

1492
01:35:07,494 --> 01:35:08,829
Come on, bring it in.

1493
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:10,539
Now, listen to me.

1494
01:35:10,622 --> 01:35:12,332
The pressure is all on them.

1495
01:35:12,457 --> 01:35:14,543
All we gotta do is hold our ground.

1496
01:35:15,585 --> 01:35:18,714
Okay, Conway, Banks... and Goldberg,

1497
01:35:19,089 --> 01:35:21,508
- I'm going with you.
- Me, Coach?

1498
01:35:21,633 --> 01:35:23,844
You, Goldberg.
You earned your spot out there.

1499
01:35:24,261 --> 01:35:26,680
Okay, Ducks? Here we go! Come on!

1500
01:35:26,763 --> 01:35:29,182
You can do it! You can do it!

1501
01:35:29,266 --> 01:35:30,600
Put it in, Guy.

1502
01:35:31,601 --> 01:35:32,936
Hey, Charlie...

1503
01:35:33,603 --> 01:35:35,439
we're really backed into a corner here.

1504
01:35:35,647 --> 01:35:37,482
We hold them for two minutes,
we got ourselves a tie.

1505
01:35:37,607 --> 01:35:38,817
We're up to it, Coach.

1506
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:41,653
I know you are, but you deserve to win.

1507
01:35:42,195 --> 01:35:44,865
Not careless, but not too careful either.

1508
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:47,617
If you see your shot, take it.

1509
01:35:48,201 --> 01:35:49,661
Make sure it counts.

1510
01:35:54,750 --> 01:35:56,376
Go get 'em, Captain.

1511
01:35:57,043 --> 01:35:59,129
<i>Five on three
for two minutes, and here we go.</i>

1512
01:36:09,514 --> 01:36:11,516
<i>Oh, no! Open net!</i>

1513
01:36:19,191 --> 01:36:21,109
<i>Goldberg clears it out of the zone.</i>

1514
01:36:30,494 --> 01:36:32,746
Make him make
the first move, Conway.

1515
01:36:32,829 --> 01:36:35,373
<i>Conway and Riley,
the two captains, are one-on-one!</i>

1516
01:36:36,166 --> 01:36:38,627
Come on, try and take me,
try and take me. Come on.

1517
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:40,212
Whoa!

1518
01:36:40,295 --> 01:36:41,588
That's what I'm talking about!

1519
01:36:48,345 --> 01:36:51,848
<i>Riley goes down and Conway
has the puck with a chance to win it.</i>

1520
01:36:51,932 --> 01:36:55,018
<i>Here he comes! A breakaway!
Ten seconds left!</i>

1521
01:37:14,371 --> 01:37:17,415
<i>He beats two men! He's all alone! He...</i>

1522
01:37:17,499 --> 01:37:19,167
<i>He passes back to...</i>

1523
01:37:22,921 --> 01:37:24,923
<i>Goldberg?</i>

1524
01:37:28,927 --> 01:37:31,471
- Shoot, Goldberg!
- Shoot, Goldberg!

1525
01:37:45,277 --> 01:37:46,361
Ducks win!

1526
01:37:46,987 --> 01:37:48,071
All right!

1527
01:37:49,114 --> 01:37:52,200
Man!

1528
01:37:52,284 --> 01:37:53,660
Yeah!

1529
01:37:53,743 --> 01:37:55,662
- Goldberg?
- Goldberg?

1530
01:37:55,745 --> 01:37:58,373
- Goldberg! Goldberg!
- Goldberg! Yeah!

1531
01:38:02,544 --> 01:38:05,672
Goldberg! Goldie, I knew you could do it.

1532
01:38:05,755 --> 01:38:09,175
- Don't ever do that to me again.
- Goldberg, you scored. We win!

1533
01:38:12,262 --> 01:38:14,306
- We win!
- Good game.

1534
01:38:14,389 --> 01:38:15,515
- Hey, thanks.
- We'll get you next time.

1535
01:38:15,599 --> 01:38:16,975
- Thank you, Coach.
- All right.

1536
01:38:18,184 --> 01:38:20,437
- Hell of a pass, Captain.
- Thanks, Coach.

1537
01:38:26,318 --> 01:38:27,611
Great game, Gaffney.

1538
01:38:27,903 --> 01:38:29,321
Thanks, Scooter.
