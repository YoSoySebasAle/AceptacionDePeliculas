Well, the crowds
there, they're dreadful.

1552
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:21,080
There are just... things

And then where would we be with just three stars?

eye on everyone.

1559
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:32,400
No.
You can't keep your eye on everyone.

1560
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:33,860
No.

1561
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,400
You couldn't keep
your eye on everyone.

1562
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:50,750
How about, um, after
dinner drinks on the house?

1563
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:54,150
Enjoy.

1564
00:48:58,110 --> 00:48:59,990
She thought we were going
to leave without paying.

1565
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:12,400
Thank you.

1566
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,030

I, um, I can only
thank you in the bed.

1571
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:38,920
You can turn the
lights out if you want.

1572
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:40,320
I'm not saying that you
have to turn them out.

1573
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:40,330
But if you want to, it doesn't really matter.
I'm not saying that you have to turn them out.

1574
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:42,830
But if you want to, it
doesn't really matter.

1575
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:43,870
It's been such a long time.

1576
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:52,400
I don't know if I remember how.

You might have to each me.
I don't know if I remember how.

1578
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:54,280
You might have to each me.

1579
00:49:57,340 --> 00:49:59,980
I mean, you know how they
do it nowadays, you know?

1580
00:49:59,980 --> 00:49:59,990
Everything. I mean,
you know how they do it nowadays, you know?

1581
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:01,510
Everything.

We can do everything.

Really, that was such a treat.

1591
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:17,340
I just got out of prison.
Really, that was such a treat.

1592
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:18,530
I just got out of prison.

1593
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:18,540
So it was very special for me.
I just got out of prison.

1594
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:20,630
So it was very special for me.

1595
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:22,090
And, you know, it's been years.

1596
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:22,100
I've been in a wet, dark cell, no sky.
And, you know, it's been years.

1597
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:26,170
I've been in a wet,
dark cell, no sky.

1598
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:26,180
And I... that's why my period stopped,
I've been in a wet, dark cell, no sky.

1599
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:28,340
And I... that's why
my period stopped,

1600
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:28,350
I think, because of the darkness.
And I... that's why my period stopped,

1601
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:30,070
I think, because
of the darkness.

1602
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:30,080
You know, first it was a week late,
then two weeks late. I think, because of the darkness.

1603
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:33,010
You know, first it was a week
late, then two weeks late.

1604
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:33,020
Pretty soon, you just forget about it. You know,
first it was a week late, then two weeks late.

1605
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:35,410
Pretty soon, you
just forget about it.

1606
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:35,420
I... I... Pretty soon,
you just forget about it.

00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:37,050
I... I...

1608
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:37,060
it's not my fault.
I... I...

1609
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:38,110
it's not my fault.

1610
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:38,120
No, no, no, no, no, no.
It's not my fault.

1611
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,080
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1612
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:40,090
I just... I want you to appreciate the bleeding.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1613
00:50:40,090 --> 00:50:45,280
I just... I want you to
appreciate the bleeding.

1614
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:45,290
I know that makes you cranky, and, you know,
I just... I want you to appreciate the bleeding.

1615
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:48,190
I know that makes you
cranky, and, you know,

you feel bloated, the pain and everything.
I know that makes you cranky, and, you know,

pain and everything.

1618
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,620
But that's not what matters.

1619
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:50,630
What matters is the bleeding.
But that's not what matters.

1620
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,870
What matters is the bleeding.

1621
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:58,670
Why are you telling me this?

1622
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:00,240
So you'll be aware.

And you tell your friends.
So you'll be aware.

She wasn't made right.

1783
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:49,020
because we went through the matter deep.
Yeah, but it's a point of honor, man,

1784

It's the brain telling the body to let go, eh?
What do you mean?

1790
01:02:56,930 --> 01:03:00,320
It's the brain telling
the body to let go, eh?

She's digging it.

1801
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:47,680
We're not involved at all.

1802
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:52,010

2070
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,340
Nothing.

2071
01:12:37,340 --> 01:12:38,640
We are accomplices to
an attempted murder.

2072
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:39,430
It's in the papers.

2073
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:39,440
You're not.
It's in the papers.

2074
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:40,340
You're not.

2075
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:40,350
You didn't hurt anyone.
You're not.

2076
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:41,570
You didn't hurt anyone.

2077
01:12:41,570 --> 01:12:41,580
But I'm... I'm in deep with you guys.
You didn't hurt anyone.

2078
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:42,870
But I'm... I'm in
deep with you guys.

2079
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:42,880
No way, man. But I'm...
I'm in deep with you guys.

2080
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:44,210
No way, man.

2081
01:12:44,210 --> 01:12:44,220
You have to go.
No way, man.

2082
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:45,640
You have to go.

2083
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:46,980
When I just started coming,
I'm feeling like this.

2084
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:47,650
No fucking way.

2085
01:12:47,650 --> 01:12:48,310
Hey!

2086
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:49,680
Hey!

2087
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:49,690
Don't be crazy, woman.
Hey!

2088
01:12:49,690 --> 01:12:51,480
Don't be crazy, woman.

2089
01:12:51,490 --> 01:12:54,410
I can't see you in a cell
with a number on your back.

2090
01:12:54,410 --> 01:12:54,420
Stretch your wings and fly, girl.
I can't see you in a cell with a number on your back.

2091
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:56,450
Stretch your wings
and fly, girl.

2092
01:12:56,450 --> 01:12:56,460
Listen to my feminine instinct.
Stretch your wings and fly, girl.

2093
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:58,220
Listen to my
feminine instinct.

2094
01:12:58,220 --> 01:12:58,230
Sometimes I have vision.
Listen to my feminine instinct.

2095
01:12:58,230 --> 01:12:59,360
Sometimes I have vision.

2096
01:12:59,360 --> 01:12:59,370
I'm never wrong.
Sometimes I have vision.

2097
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:00,250
I'm never wrong.

2098
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:00,260
We're not going to jail.
I'm never wrong.

2099
01:13:00,260 --> 01:13:01,990
We're not going to jail.

2100
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,900
So shut up and make love to me.

2101
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:19,580
I don't know who
chose this car,

2102
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:21,680
but it's worse
than a prison cell.

2103
01:13:21,680 --> 01:13:23,250
Ah, it's good for
the environment.

2104
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:23,260
Fuck the environment.
Ah, it's good for the environment.

2105
01:13:23,260 --> 01:13:24,610
Fuck the environment.

2106
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:24,620
Man, I can't breathe.
Fuck the environment.

2107
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:25,640
Man, I can't breathe.

2108
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:25,650
I got to get out of here.
Man, I can't breathe.

2109
01:13:25,650 --> 01:13:26,610
I got to get out of here.

2110
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:26,620
Oh, he can't breathe, man.
I got to get out of here.

2111
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:27,780
Oh, he can't breathe, man.

2112
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:27,790
What about the other people too.
Oh, he can't breathe, man.

2113
01:13:27,790 --> 01:13:29,520
What about the other people too.

2114
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:30,690
There's other people in the car.

2115
01:13:30,690 --> 01:13:31,590
It's not just you.

2116
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:31,600
I know, but I...
It's not just you.

2117
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:32,920
I know, but I...

01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:32,930
You know it's always about him, right, Marie?
I know, but I...

2119
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:34,390
You know it's always
about him, right, Marie?

2120
01:13:34,390 --> 01:13:34,400
I'm getting really squished here.
You know it's always about him, right, Marie?

2121
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:35,290

It's unbelievable, man.

I told you not.

2128
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:56,450
A family picnic and shit.

2129
01:13:56,450 --> 01:13:56,460
Ah, no, no, no.
A family picnic and shit.

2130

Oh, filthy hairdresser.

2226
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:21,310
I thought this
car looked familiar.

2227

Yeah, it was orange, I remember.

We'll find a way.

2240
01:22:43,410 --> 01:22:46,290
We'll find a way home.

2241
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:50,890
Always now.

2242
01:22:53,950 --> 01:22:55,260
Always now.

2243
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:01,270
Always now.

2244
01:23:04,330 --> 01:23:06,230
Always now.

2245
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:42,590
Like a shooting star, we're
fast, alone,

2246
01:23:42,590 --> 01:23:42,600
and already gone.
Like a shooting star, we're fast, alone,

2247
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:46,900
and already gone.

2248
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:46,910
Like a number one we'll find a way.
And already gone.

2249
01:23:46,910 --> 01:23:53,150
Like a number one
we'll find a way.

2250
01:23:53,150 --> 01:23:55,390
We'll find a way home.

2251
01:23:58,490 --> 01:23:59,330
Always now.

2252
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:04,170
Always now.

2253
01:24:08,390 --> 01:24:09,900
Always now.

2254
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:16,880
It's always now.
