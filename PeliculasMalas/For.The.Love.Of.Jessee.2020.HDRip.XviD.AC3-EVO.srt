00:02:32,078 --> 00:02:33,077
Jessica?

3
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:35,081
I'm in here.

4
00:02:50,997 --> 00:02:52,631
Gosh, you still like this one?

5
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:54,999
Are you kidding me?

6
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:57,902
That is my favorite
tattoo, I got that

7
00:02:57,904 --> 00:03:00,603
- the night we met.
- The night we met.

8
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:02,172
Best night of my life.

9
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:14,952
Oh, hey, don't forget
we got dinner tonight.

10
00:03:14,954 --> 00:03:17,487
Last chance to act
like normal people.

11
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,555
Wouldn't miss it for the
world, I love you always.

12
00:03:19,557 --> 00:03:20,492
And forever.

13
00:03:34,273 --> 00:03:35,839
Got your
blood work back.

14
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,241
And?

15
00:03:37,243 --> 00:03:39,743
And everything looks
good, growth rate is normal

16
00:03:39,745 --> 00:03:41,912
and your alpha-fetoprotein
came back negative.

17
00:03:41,914 --> 00:03:45,515
I don't know what an
alpha-feta-beta-tron is,

18
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:46,649
but is that a good thing?

19
00:03:46,651 --> 00:03:47,952
Is that a good thing?

20
00:03:47,954 --> 00:03:49,552
Yes, yes, dear,
it's a good thing.

21
00:03:49,554 --> 00:03:50,988
Sorry, I'm just
a little nervous.

22
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,523
First-time parents, I'm
sure you're used to it.

23
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,993
Actually, my wife is
pregnant with our first

24
00:03:55,995 --> 00:03:57,694
and I can tell you it is
much more nerve-racking

25
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:58,594
on your side of the table.

26
00:03:58,596 --> 00:04:00,130
Congrats.

27
00:04:00,132 --> 00:04:02,032
Thank you, but you guys are
doing all the right things.

28
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,700
Keep taking your
prenatal vitamins

29
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,903
and stay on track with
your low-impact exercise.

30
00:04:05,905 --> 00:04:07,974
And with that, we'll
see you guys next week.

31
00:04:12,644 --> 00:04:14,011
And please, do not be shy.

32
00:04:14,013 --> 00:04:16,113
If you have any
questions, give us a call.

33
00:04:16,115 --> 00:04:17,714
Will do doc, thanks.

34
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:18,683
See ya next time.

35
00:04:22,021 --> 00:04:24,321
Tell me I am done for the day.

36
00:04:24,323 --> 00:04:26,256
I have a hot date tonight.

37
00:04:26,258 --> 00:04:28,759
Oh, you two are so cute.

38
00:04:28,761 --> 00:04:30,162
Yes, we are.

39
00:04:32,832 --> 00:04:35,165
Dr. Matthews, I'm so sorry
for running late, the bus.

40
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:38,235
Miss Smith, always
with a graceful entry.

41
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:39,038
Come on back.

42
00:04:44,676 --> 00:04:46,143
Everything okay?

43
00:04:46,145 --> 00:04:50,214
Yeah, sorry, just, this
place still makes me nervous.

44
00:04:50,216 --> 00:04:52,715
Well, we can play some
smooth jazz if you'd like,

45
00:04:52,717 --> 00:04:54,854
dim the lights,
light some incense.

46
00:04:56,322 --> 00:04:58,556
You're 39 weeks along,
everything all right?

47
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:02,292
Yeah, I've been all
right, just trying

48
00:05:02,294 --> 00:05:04,594
to get used to doing
this on my own.

49
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,096
On your own?

50
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:09,933
Allen, seems he'd rather
work things out with the band.

51
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,969
Everything okay?

52
00:05:11,971 --> 00:05:13,603
Oh, it's fine.

53
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,873
Things have been a bit
stressful lately but luckily,

54
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:19,043
this little guy hasn't been
fussing around too much.

55
00:05:19,045 --> 00:05:19,945
How do you mean?

56
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,180
Oh, he's just been mellow
for the past few days.

57
00:05:23,182 --> 00:05:25,015
He must know Mama needs a break.

58
00:05:25,017 --> 00:05:26,383
Well, usually
it's pretty normal

59
00:05:26,385 --> 00:05:28,352
they calm down
right before birth.

60
00:05:28,354 --> 00:05:29,953
Why don't I have you lie back

61
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,055
and we'll see how your
little man is doing?

62
00:05:31,057 --> 00:05:32,091
Okay.

63
00:05:37,096 --> 00:05:38,729
Yeah, my mum was right.

64
00:05:38,731 --> 00:05:40,166
"Don't tattoo your
stomach," she said.

65
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:44,667
I have a few, my mom
hates them as well.

66
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:46,937
Wow, look at you, Dr. Ink.

67
00:05:46,939 --> 00:05:49,008
Let's see how your
mellow man is doing.

68
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:56,046
Honey, I'm really
sorry about Allen.

69
00:05:56,048 --> 00:05:57,713
Are you gonna be okay?

70
00:05:57,715 --> 00:05:59,715
Nothing lasts
forever, as they say.

71
00:05:59,717 --> 00:06:02,019
But I picked up an extra
job to pay for expenses.

72
00:06:02,021 --> 00:06:03,719
Work?

73
00:06:03,721 --> 00:06:05,655
Honey, you're supposed to
be taking care of yourself.

74
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:08,058
I am, I just like being busy.

75
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,828
Hm.

76
00:06:09,962 --> 00:06:12,996
What is it, is
everything okay?

77
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:15,899
I can't find the
fetal heartbeat.

78
00:06:15,901 --> 00:06:19,069
But like I said, sometimes
it slows down before birth.

79
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:20,037
We'll take you to
the radiologist

80
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:21,004
and we'll get a better look.

81
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,940
And you can't do it here?

82
00:06:22,942 --> 00:06:26,045
Normally, yes, but, our
machine's out for repairs.

83
00:06:28,781 --> 00:06:30,080
Honey, it'll be okay.

84
00:06:30,082 --> 00:06:32,249
I'll take you over
there, all right?

85
00:06:32,251 --> 00:06:33,085
Okay.

86
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:38,688
Radiology.

87
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,124
Yeah, hi, this
is Dr. Matthews.

88
00:06:40,126 --> 00:06:43,060
I have a patient 39 weeks
along, no fetal heartbeat.

89
00:06:43,062 --> 00:06:44,194
When
are you bringing her in?

90
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:45,429
We're on our way now.

91
00:06:45,431 --> 00:06:46,799
- All right, we'll be ready.
- Thanks.

92
00:06:49,735 --> 00:06:50,467
- Hey.
- Hey.

93
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:52,269
Where you going?

94
00:06:52,271 --> 00:06:55,105
Radiology, I have to let
Jessica know I'm gonna be late.

95
00:06:55,107 --> 00:06:57,241
Nope, get outta
here, I got it covered.

96
00:06:57,243 --> 00:06:58,809
Oh, no, it's fine, man.

97
00:06:58,811 --> 00:07:01,011
No, remember what
happened last time?

98
00:07:01,013 --> 00:07:03,883
She'll kill you,
until you're dead.

99
00:07:05,017 --> 00:07:07,751
True, uh, you're sure?

100
00:07:07,753 --> 00:07:09,355
I'm here all night anyway.

101
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:15,025
Young female, no fetal
heartbeat, I owe you.

102
00:07:15,027 --> 00:07:16,226
Yeah, you do.

103
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:17,794
Thank you.

104
00:07:17,796 --> 00:07:22,168
Dr. Peter

105
00:07:45,991 --> 00:07:49,092
Can you tell me something,
is everything okay?

106
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,861
I'm sorry, honey.

107
00:07:50,863 --> 00:07:54,431
Your doctor will have to be the
one to give you the results.

108
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:56,168
I'll go ahead and
page him right now.

109
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:05,144
Excuse me?

110
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:27,933
Oof.

111
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,036
You okay?

112
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:36,075
Oh, yeah, she's
just busy today.

113
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:38,508
- Thank you.
- I'll get this for you.

114
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,345
Yeah.

115
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,251
Hey, where are you at?

116
00:08:47,853 --> 00:08:49,755
I'm just thinking
about my last patient.

117
00:08:51,123 --> 00:08:52,856
We couldn't find the
baby's heartbeat.

118
00:08:52,858 --> 00:08:55,525
It's scary.

119
00:08:55,527 --> 00:08:57,894
Scarier now, huh?

120
00:08:57,896 --> 00:08:58,530
Yeah.

121
00:09:00,132 --> 00:09:04,101
Well, I think it's good
that you still worry.

122
00:09:04,103 --> 00:09:05,971
It's what makes
you a good doctor.

123
00:09:07,106 --> 00:09:08,274
It's what makes me love you.

124
00:09:09,241 --> 00:09:11,975
And I love you, always.

125
00:09:11,977 --> 00:09:12,778
And forever.

126
00:09:18,384 --> 00:09:20,484
Ms. Smith?

127
00:09:20,486 --> 00:09:22,419
Sorry to keep you waiting.

128
00:09:22,421 --> 00:09:23,987
Where's Dr. Matthews?

129
00:09:23,989 --> 00:09:26,123
He had to step out tonight.

130
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,793
- But he's my...
- Sage,

131
00:09:29,028 --> 00:09:31,330
there's no easy way to say this.

132
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:36,268
Your baby died in utero.

133
00:09:38,637 --> 00:09:40,439
There's nothing you
could have done.

134
00:09:43,008 --> 00:09:43,976
I'm terribly sorry.

135
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:48,045
I'm so sorry, Sage.

136
00:11:19,505 --> 00:11:21,371
Oh, Sean's gonna
cover me tomorrow

137
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:23,575
so I can be home when
the crib is delivered.

138
00:11:25,244 --> 00:11:26,576
You okay?

139
00:11:26,578 --> 00:11:27,613
Yeah, no, my chest
just feels tight.

140
00:11:29,348 --> 00:11:31,481
Maybe our little girl's not
as big of a fan of Tommy's

141
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:36,088
- as we are.
- Right?

142
00:11:37,156 --> 00:11:39,022
Ooh, oof.

143
00:11:39,024 --> 00:11:40,090
What is it?

144
00:11:40,092 --> 00:11:41,591
Ooh, oh my God.

145
00:11:41,593 --> 00:11:43,093
- Jessica?
- Oh, no, I don't know...

146
00:11:43,095 --> 00:11:44,661
- Hey, hey.
- Ah, no, no, no...

147
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:45,662
Hey, hey, hey, come
here, just sit here.

148
00:11:47,232 --> 00:11:49,099
- Careful, careful, careful.
- Okay, okay, okay.

149
00:11:49,101 --> 00:11:50,167
- Sit back, sit back.
- Okay, okay.

150
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:51,501
Oh my God, it really hurts.

151
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:54,337
It's okay.

152
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:56,440
- Okay, okay.
- Sit back, you're okay.

153
00:11:56,442 --> 00:11:59,509
Ooh, oh my God.

154
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:00,778
I'm gonna call an ambulance.

155
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,345
I'm gonna call an
ambulance, you're fine.

156
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:05,048
- You're okay, just relax.
- Okay.

157
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,216
- You're gonna be okay.
- I'm really scared,

158
00:12:06,218 --> 00:12:07,517
- okay, okay.
- You're gonna be okay,

159
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,252
you're gonna be
okay, just breathe.

160
00:12:09,254 --> 00:12:14,226
Okay, okay.

161
00:12:31,176 --> 00:12:32,544
Hey, you're okay.

162
00:12:34,313 --> 00:12:35,647
Stay with me, Jess.

163
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:40,083
Look at me, look
right here, okay?

164
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:48,124
So there's no one,
no family we can call?

165
00:12:48,126 --> 00:12:50,728
You know, we've tried, but
I don't think there's anybody.

166
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,295
Dr. Matthews just called.

167
00:12:52,297 --> 00:12:54,132
There's something
wrong with Jessica.

168
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:57,100
Come on, let's get to the ER.

169
00:12:57,102 --> 00:12:58,235
Okay.

170
00:13:10,516 --> 00:13:12,082
Luke, Luke, what happened?

171
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:14,150
She said her chest
hurt, and then,

172
00:13:14,152 --> 00:13:15,719
there's just blood and,

173
00:13:15,721 --> 00:13:17,320
- I gotta get a...
- Hey, hey!

174
00:13:17,322 --> 00:13:18,655
I'm not gonna let you
do that, all right?

175
00:13:18,657 --> 00:13:19,689
We don't have time for this,

176
00:13:19,691 --> 00:13:20,858
this is not a debate, it's not...

177
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,693
- No!
- Hey!

178
00:13:22,795 --> 00:13:24,294
I got this.

179
00:13:24,296 --> 00:13:26,096
Doctor,
she's flatlining.

180
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:30,267
All right,
she's in V-fib.

181
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:32,104
Put the crash cart on now.

182
00:13:33,505 --> 00:13:35,605
Let's go, charging 360.

183
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:36,540
Charged.

184
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:38,143
Clear, shock.

185
00:13:42,714 --> 00:13:45,117
All right, feel for pulses.

186
00:13:46,685 --> 00:13:47,818
All right, she's still in V-fib.

187
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,320
Gimme epi, one-milligram IV.

188
00:13:59,331 --> 00:13:59,766
Luke,

189
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:06,570
we have five minutes to get
this baby out or it's too late.

190
00:14:06,572 --> 00:14:07,372
Luke.

191
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,243
All right, everybody, we're
prepping for a crash C-section.

192
00:14:13,245 --> 00:14:15,645
Let's go, somebody glove me.

193
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:18,181
Come on, people, let's move.

194
00:15:18,276 --> 00:15:20,479
Hi, Sage, how are you feeling?

195
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:24,650
I can't sleep.

196
00:15:25,852 --> 00:15:27,352
I need pills or something.

197
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:29,954
I can check with
the night nurse

198
00:15:29,956 --> 00:15:31,756
and see if she can
bring you something.

199
00:15:31,758 --> 00:15:33,556
Sure, whatever.

200
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:35,762
Is there anything
else that I can get you?

201
00:15:42,267 --> 00:15:43,235
My baby.

202
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:54,945
Honey, I know
it's not my place,

203
00:15:54,947 --> 00:15:57,480
but if you'd like to say
goodbye to your baby,

204
00:15:57,482 --> 00:15:59,184
arrangements can be made.

205
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:04,589
You're right, it
is not your place.

206
00:16:47,767 --> 00:16:51,003
Sweetheart,
where's your daddy?

207
00:16:52,805 --> 00:16:53,638
Luke?

208
00:16:55,407 --> 00:16:56,241
Hi.

209
00:16:57,977 --> 00:16:59,011
Oh my God.

210
00:17:01,981 --> 00:17:03,482
Is that how you
greet your mother?

211
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:06,986
What happened to this
place, it's a mess.

212
00:17:08,855 --> 00:17:10,689
What happened to
the help I hired?

213
00:17:11,891 --> 00:17:13,323
I fired her.

214
00:17:13,325 --> 00:17:15,460
You fired her, why?

215
00:17:16,763 --> 00:17:18,361
She wanted to be
a live-in nanny.

216
00:17:18,363 --> 00:17:19,964
That's the last
thing that I want.

217
00:17:19,966 --> 00:17:20,865
Why not?

218
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:22,632
You've got the room.

219
00:17:22,634 --> 00:17:24,436
I don't need someone
watching over me.

220
00:17:25,805 --> 00:17:27,840
I think you do,
look at this place.

221
00:17:29,574 --> 00:17:31,708
Did you come over to judge
the cleanliness of my house

222
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,676
or did you actually
need something?

223
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:37,415
I came over to see my
precious little granddaughter.

224
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:39,551
And my son.

225
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,385
We're fine.

226
00:17:42,387 --> 00:17:45,790
Oh, I think you're
floundering at best.

227
00:17:45,792 --> 00:17:47,357
When's the last time
you took a shower?

228
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,059
I said we're fine.

229
00:17:49,061 --> 00:17:51,929
Luke, if you're not
gonna help yourself,

230
00:17:51,931 --> 00:17:55,632
then you're forcing me to
stay here and help you both.

231
00:17:55,634 --> 00:17:58,401
And how exactly are
you gonna help, Katharyn?

232
00:17:58,403 --> 00:18:00,639
Well, you need
to go back to work.

233
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:05,077
Work is the best thing to help
you get out of this slump.

234
00:18:06,645 --> 00:18:07,445
Slump?

235
00:18:09,048 --> 00:18:11,782
I didn't lose my job or get
kicked off a baseball team, mom,

236
00:18:11,784 --> 00:18:13,150
my wife died!

237
00:18:13,152 --> 00:18:14,486
Keep your voice down.

238
00:18:15,988 --> 00:18:20,492
I lost my wife and became
a father in the same hour.

239
00:18:21,828 --> 00:18:22,728
If that's your idea of a slump,

240
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:26,665
I would hate to hear
your idea of a crisis.

241
00:18:30,602 --> 00:18:32,939
I don't mean to make
light of the situation, son.

242
00:18:34,706 --> 00:18:37,141
But these things will
not fix themselves.

243
00:18:37,143 --> 00:18:40,643
So I will stay here
for a little while,

244
00:18:40,645 --> 00:18:42,982
but you are hiring help.

245
00:20:41,167 --> 00:20:42,532
Yeah, he
was always

246
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:44,301
in their relationship.

247
00:20:44,303 --> 00:20:45,936
Oh, that reminds me.

248
00:20:45,938 --> 00:20:48,707
Your mother sent us a postcard.

249
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,910
Where from now?

250
00:20:52,912 --> 00:20:55,815
She has her moments.

251
00:20:58,084 --> 00:21:01,551
That is why
you're gonna be a good mother.

252
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,997
I love you always.

253
00:21:12,999 --> 00:21:14,597
Forever.

254
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,380
You look tired.

255
00:22:03,382 --> 00:22:05,315
Good morning to you too.

256
00:22:05,317 --> 00:22:07,051
I couldn't sleep.

257
00:22:07,053 --> 00:22:09,987
We need to start looking
for full-time help, son.

258
00:22:09,989 --> 00:22:12,256
I'm working on it,
I'm just not ready yet.

259
00:22:12,258 --> 00:22:13,824
Well, when are you
going to be ready?

260
00:22:13,826 --> 00:22:16,060
Because I'm running outta time.

261
00:22:16,062 --> 00:22:18,628
I'm on it, see you later.

262
00:22:24,003 --> 00:22:25,869
Okay.

263
00:22:25,871 --> 00:22:28,906
I mean, I'm happy
with everything...

264
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:31,875
There he is.

265
00:22:31,877 --> 00:22:32,976
What's happening, brother?

266
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:34,013
Good to see you, man.

267
00:22:35,815 --> 00:22:38,982
Luke, so good to see you.

268
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:40,417
Ya look great.

269
00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:41,787
Yeah, well, thanks.

270
00:22:43,189 --> 00:22:44,687
Did you get your new
phone or something?

271
00:22:44,689 --> 00:22:46,656
I called you and texted
you like 1000 times.

272
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:49,827
Yeah, I saw, I saw, I just,

273
00:22:49,829 --> 00:22:51,195
I've been busy, you know?

274
00:22:51,197 --> 00:22:53,230
Hey, how's that
little lady of yours?

275
00:22:53,232 --> 00:22:55,132
I can hardly wait to see her.

276
00:22:55,134 --> 00:22:58,035
Yeah, she's good, just
lots of poop and drool.

277
00:22:58,037 --> 00:23:01,004
Well, she takes after
her old man, then.

278
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:04,110
Who's with her now?

279
00:23:05,945 --> 00:23:07,012
My mother's in town.

280
00:23:08,314 --> 00:23:09,980
Katharyn's in town?

281
00:23:09,982 --> 00:23:13,383
Temporarily, I'm looking
for full-time help.

282
00:23:13,385 --> 00:23:15,052
Like a nanny?

283
00:23:15,054 --> 00:23:16,719
Like a nanny.

284
00:23:16,721 --> 00:23:18,324
You know, that
is a great idea.

285
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:20,791
Is it?

286
00:23:20,793 --> 00:23:22,159
I read as long as they
don't take your kid,

287
00:23:22,161 --> 00:23:23,961
you should be good.

288
00:23:23,963 --> 00:23:25,129
Very funny, Sean.

289
00:23:25,131 --> 00:23:27,164
- What?
- I gotta get back to work.

290
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:27,967
Hey,

291
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:30,100
let's hang out, man.

292
00:23:30,102 --> 00:23:32,269
I got work to catch up on.

293
00:23:32,271 --> 00:23:33,239
Yeah, of course.

294
00:23:37,977 --> 00:23:39,910
It's good to have you back.

295
00:23:59,865 --> 00:24:01,033
It was a great wedding.

296
00:24:03,802 --> 00:24:04,970
Best day of my life.

297
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,439
Anyway, I was just
checking in on you.

298
00:24:09,441 --> 00:24:11,775
We got that
consultation in an hour,

299
00:24:11,777 --> 00:24:14,044
so I don't know if,
are you up for it, or?

300
00:24:14,046 --> 00:24:16,182
I'm fine, just buzz
me when you're ready.

301
00:24:28,227 --> 00:24:29,395
Here you go.

302
00:24:30,329 --> 00:24:31,828
Thank you, Sarah.

303
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,798
Can I have the check, please?

304
00:24:42,808 --> 00:24:43,842
Miss Smith?

305
00:24:48,981 --> 00:24:50,015
Dr. Matthews.

306
00:24:51,884 --> 00:24:52,717
How are you?

307
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,322
Clearly, I'm fine.

308
00:24:59,091 --> 00:25:01,093
Would you like to sit?

309
00:25:18,244 --> 00:25:19,378
Going somewhere?

310
00:25:20,913 --> 00:25:22,748
You've got to be
kidding me, right?

311
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:27,017
What, you been too
busy vacationing?

312
00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:29,822
Drinking Mai Tais on the beach
with your beautiful wife?

313
00:25:31,457 --> 00:25:34,091
I lost my baby that night.

314
00:25:34,093 --> 00:25:35,961
So I hope the date was worth it.

315
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:39,830
I wanna try and explain.

316
00:25:39,832 --> 00:25:40,266
Please.

317
00:25:41,867 --> 00:25:43,900
Explain to me how
your perfect life got

318
00:25:43,902 --> 00:25:44,970
in the way of that night.

319
00:25:51,543 --> 00:25:52,945
Exactly.

320
00:25:56,949 --> 00:25:57,783
I'm sorry.

321
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:01,487
Truly, I am sorry.

322
00:26:09,428 --> 00:26:11,128
Can we just get out of here.

323
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:13,432
If you give me a chance, I
would really like to explain.

324
00:26:18,137 --> 00:26:18,971
Please?

325
00:26:26,578 --> 00:26:30,249
It was an amniotic
embolism, it's very rare.

326
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,351
Dr. Matthews...

327
00:26:34,887 --> 00:26:36,887
I can't even imagine all of that

328
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:38,290
within minutes, that's horrible.

329
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:47,497
Hello.

330
00:26:47,499 --> 00:26:49,001
Sage, this is Katharyn.

331
00:26:51,003 --> 00:26:52,071
I'm his mother.

332
00:26:56,141 --> 00:26:59,376
I hope you're not here to
interview dressed like that.

333
00:26:59,378 --> 00:27:00,212
Interview?

334
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:03,113
Oh, she's an old patient.

335
00:27:03,115 --> 00:27:06,049
Ran into each other, I
thought we'd have lunch.

336
00:27:06,051 --> 00:27:06,852
Ah.

337
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:13,023
Your son is a great doctor,
I'm sure you're very proud.

338
00:27:13,025 --> 00:27:14,526
Yes, I am.

339
00:27:16,028 --> 00:27:16,595
Oh.

340
00:27:18,297 --> 00:27:20,497
Well, looks like you get to
meet the star of the show.

341
00:27:26,638 --> 00:27:27,473
So,

342
00:27:28,707 --> 00:27:29,975
you were his patient.

343
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,976
Yeah.

344
00:27:32,978 --> 00:27:33,612
Cancer?

345
00:27:42,688 --> 00:27:44,388
Here's my little nugget.

346
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,156
Sage, this is Jessee.

347
00:27:46,158 --> 00:27:49,428
Oh, my, she's
adorable, hi, may I?

348
00:27:50,596 --> 00:27:51,430
Of course.

349
00:27:53,098 --> 00:27:54,364
Ah,

350
00:27:54,366 --> 00:27:55,401
she's so cute!

351
00:27:57,069 --> 00:27:58,602
Yeah, don't let that
pretty face fool you.

352
00:27:58,604 --> 00:28:00,103
She can be a handful.

353
00:28:00,105 --> 00:28:03,073
Oh, could you be
mad at this face?

354
00:28:03,075 --> 00:28:05,409
'Cause it's easy, right?

355
00:28:05,411 --> 00:28:08,514
Oh, I wouldn't be mad,
not one bit, no, not me, no.

356
00:28:10,149 --> 00:28:12,050
Hi, hi.

357
00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:15,986
Sage, you have nanny
experience, right?

358
00:28:15,988 --> 00:28:19,122
Oh, sure, I used to work
with the Dunhills, actually.

359
00:28:19,124 --> 00:28:21,224
Well, I am looking
to hire a nanny.

360
00:28:21,226 --> 00:28:22,192
Luke.

361
00:28:22,194 --> 00:28:23,460
It would start immediately

362
00:28:23,462 --> 00:28:25,028
as a full-time,
live-in position.

363
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,064
Are you serious?

364
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,299
Are you interested?

365
00:28:29,301 --> 00:28:32,070
I am so interested, yes.

366
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:37,040
I know the Dunhills,
I'll call them.

367
00:28:37,042 --> 00:28:39,042
And please tell
them I said hi.

368
00:28:39,044 --> 00:28:40,410
I started going
back to work part-time

369
00:28:40,412 --> 00:28:42,681
and then in about a week
or so I'll be full-time.

370
00:28:43,715 --> 00:28:45,415
Dr. Matthews, I mean, Luke,

371
00:28:45,417 --> 00:28:48,251
I can't thank you enough.

372
00:28:48,253 --> 00:28:50,220
Well, you could start
today, if you'd like.

373
00:28:50,222 --> 00:28:52,689
- Are you serious?
- Mm-hm.

374
00:28:52,691 --> 00:28:54,291
That is awesome.

375
00:28:54,293 --> 00:28:56,462
I need to go grab some
things, yes, I do.

376
00:28:59,131 --> 00:28:59,965
Thank you.

377
00:29:04,236 --> 00:29:05,370
That worked out well.

378
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,272
What?

379
00:29:09,274 --> 00:29:11,809
I already know her, she
has experience, and...

380
00:29:11,811 --> 00:29:14,211
And a shaved head.

381
00:29:14,213 --> 00:29:15,712
And tattoos.

382
00:29:15,714 --> 00:29:17,481
And look at the way she dresses,

383
00:29:17,483 --> 00:29:19,683
she looks like one of those
kids you used to hang out with.

384
00:29:19,685 --> 00:29:21,218
Well, I like her.

385
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,187
Well, I just don't
think it's right.

386
00:29:24,189 --> 00:29:28,560
You having a young girl like
that living in the house.

387
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:34,433
Hey.

388
00:29:35,802 --> 00:29:37,634
I will show you your room.

389
00:29:37,636 --> 00:29:39,171
- Right this way.
- Okay.

390
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:56,021
Hey, have
you seen my keys?

391
00:29:58,123 --> 00:29:59,525
Those ones over there?

392
00:30:05,297 --> 00:30:07,564
Well, since my work is done,

393
00:30:07,566 --> 00:30:09,232
for a while, at least,

394
00:30:09,234 --> 00:30:12,737
I am off to Sedona
with the ladies.

395
00:30:12,739 --> 00:30:14,704
Would you like me to
help you with your luggage?

396
00:30:14,706 --> 00:30:16,673
No thanks, dear,
I'm quite capable.

397
00:30:16,675 --> 00:30:19,812
What you could do, however,
is clean that baby's crib.

398
00:30:20,847 --> 00:30:22,381
It's becoming ghastly.

399
00:30:23,883 --> 00:30:25,250
I'll see you next time.

400
00:30:31,323 --> 00:30:33,758
Okay, I'm gonna be
gone most the day.

401
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,258
I'll have my cell on me.

402
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,861
The diapers are in the nursery,

403
00:30:36,863 --> 00:30:40,564
the extra bottle's
in the kitchen, the...

404
00:30:40,566 --> 00:30:43,667
Yeah, I got it,
go, you're late.

405
00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:45,736
We have a big day ahead of us.

406
00:30:45,738 --> 00:30:47,637
- All right.
- Don't we, little lady?

407
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:50,173
Thank you.

408
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:55,846
Your
call has been forwarded

409
00:30:55,848 --> 00:30:58,315
to an automated voice
messaging system.

410
00:30:58,317 --> 00:31:00,751
At the tone, please record
your message.

411
00:31:00,753 --> 00:31:01,620
Hey, man.

412
00:31:02,889 --> 00:31:03,689
It's me again.

413
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:05,792
Um...

414
00:31:07,426 --> 00:31:10,329
Yeah, just, just
checking in on you.

415
00:31:12,832 --> 00:31:14,499
Just thinking about that time

416
00:31:15,868 --> 00:31:17,135
we all went camping and,

417
00:31:18,503 --> 00:31:19,937
you got that big ol'
mosquito bite on your face

418
00:31:19,939 --> 00:31:21,906
and it swelled up.

419
00:31:21,908 --> 00:31:26,879
Jess and I convinced you you
had West Nile.

420
00:31:27,914 --> 00:31:28,678
Yeah, that was pretty funny...

421
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,882
Hey, you.

422
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:31,751
No phones on the mats.

423
00:31:33,285 --> 00:31:35,187
Think your fingers have
had enough exercise.

424
00:31:41,928 --> 00:31:44,895
Anyway, give me a call back.

425
00:31:44,897 --> 00:31:46,899
I hope you're well, man.

426
00:31:59,846 --> 00:32:00,847
- Hey.
- Hey.

427
00:32:52,999 --> 00:32:53,833
Whoa,

428
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,234
hot...

429
00:32:58,637 --> 00:32:59,904
Babe.

430
00:33:26,766 --> 00:33:27,566
What's up, doc?

431
00:33:28,533 --> 00:33:29,634
Wanna grab some lunch?

432
00:33:30,737 --> 00:33:32,669
I would if I could.

433
00:33:32,671 --> 00:33:34,006
Got all these new patients.

434
00:33:34,974 --> 00:33:36,941
Thought you'd say that.

435
00:33:36,943 --> 00:33:38,911
Tuna on wheat, turkey on rye.

436
00:33:41,546 --> 00:33:42,547
Tuna.

437
00:33:43,916 --> 00:33:44,951
All right.

438
00:33:46,986 --> 00:33:47,820
Whew.

439
00:33:50,923 --> 00:33:51,758
Sage, huh?

440
00:33:53,826 --> 00:33:55,960
Seems like things are
going pretty good.

441
00:33:55,962 --> 00:33:57,427
Can't be all bad
havin' a hot nanny

442
00:33:57,429 --> 00:33:58,697
running around the house.

443
00:33:59,866 --> 00:34:00,900
She's been helpful.

444
00:34:01,968 --> 00:34:03,734
Really?

445
00:34:03,736 --> 00:34:05,035
That's it, Luke?

446
00:34:05,037 --> 00:34:06,771
That's all you're gonna give me?

447
00:34:06,773 --> 00:34:09,874
Come on, man, she's looking
after Jessee all the time,

448
00:34:09,876 --> 00:34:11,374
she's living at your house.

449
00:34:11,376 --> 00:34:12,442
I bet she's cooking
for ya now, huh?

450
00:34:12,444 --> 00:34:13,476
Is she cooking for ya?

451
00:34:13,478 --> 00:34:14,979
She's cooking for ya, isn't she?

452
00:34:14,981 --> 00:34:17,114
Is there anything else
I can help you with, Sean?

453
00:34:17,116 --> 00:34:18,783
Little busy.

454
00:34:18,785 --> 00:34:21,484
Lighten up, man, come on,
I'm just messing around.

455
00:34:21,486 --> 00:34:23,386
You used to like
to laugh, remember?

456
00:34:23,388 --> 00:34:25,490
Yeah, and you used
to be good at your job.

457
00:34:29,829 --> 00:34:32,129
What's that supposed to mean?

458
00:34:32,131 --> 00:34:33,429
Nothing, man,
don't worry about it.

459
00:34:33,431 --> 00:34:35,532
Is this about Jessica?

460
00:34:35,534 --> 00:34:36,834
You know as well as I do

461
00:34:36,836 --> 00:34:37,902
that we did everything
that we could.

462
00:34:37,904 --> 00:34:39,502
Did you, though?

463
00:34:39,504 --> 00:34:40,338
Did you?

464
00:34:43,575 --> 00:34:45,976
I know you got a lot
going on in your head.

465
00:34:45,978 --> 00:34:48,346
So I'm not gonna react
the way I probably should.

466
00:34:52,484 --> 00:34:53,418
Enjoy the sandwich.

467
00:34:56,421 --> 00:34:58,690
Yes, I ordered the
test just before I left.

468
00:35:00,425 --> 00:35:01,060
I know.

469
00:35:03,029 --> 00:35:04,061
Okay.

470
00:35:04,063 --> 00:35:05,664
Just make sure it happens.

471
00:35:06,966 --> 00:35:08,098
All right, talk
to you then, bye.

472
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,000
Hey, so dinner
is in the fridge

473
00:35:10,002 --> 00:35:12,569
and Jessee is fed,
bathed, and pooped.

474
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:13,904
Great.

475
00:35:13,906 --> 00:35:15,438
Oh, so, I actually
just put her down

476
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,975
if you wanna pop in
and say goodnight.

477
00:35:17,977 --> 00:35:19,011
Nah, I don't wanna wake her.

478
00:35:20,913 --> 00:35:22,880
I've been taking her to
this baby group in the park

479
00:35:22,882 --> 00:35:24,949
and they would
love it if you were

480
00:35:24,951 --> 00:35:26,618
to pop by and say
hi to everyone.

481
00:35:28,154 --> 00:35:29,019
'Bout what?

482
00:35:29,021 --> 00:35:29,755
The baby group.

483
00:35:31,556 --> 00:35:34,557
Yeah, hangin' out with mommy
groups really isn't my thing.

484
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:36,126
Did they need money?

485
00:35:36,128 --> 00:35:39,031
No, they just thought it would
be nice to meet the father.

486
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:44,402
Oh, maybe if I get more
time, I'll let you know.

487
00:35:55,014 --> 00:35:59,785
Good girl, such a hungry
little monkey.

488
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,652
Good morning, Luke, would
you like some breakfast?

489
00:36:02,654 --> 00:36:04,021
Nope, I'm all right.

490
00:36:04,023 --> 00:36:06,056
So, I was hoping
that you would be able

491
00:36:06,058 --> 00:36:09,128
to put her down tonight, I
think she misses her daddy.

492
00:36:10,763 --> 00:36:11,862
I'll do my best.

493
00:36:11,864 --> 00:36:12,997
- Okay, here.
- Thanks.

494
00:36:12,999 --> 00:36:15,232
Oh, I'm sorry.

495
00:36:17,569 --> 00:36:18,436
My bad.

496
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:20,237
Here we're dancing.

497
00:36:22,909 --> 00:36:24,909
I'll try to be
home early tonight.

498
00:36:24,911 --> 00:36:26,542
Sounds good.

499
00:36:26,544 --> 00:36:29,545
Kisses.

500
00:36:31,984 --> 00:36:34,550
Good girl.

501
00:36:40,793 --> 00:36:41,894
There you are.

502
00:36:43,095 --> 00:36:45,031
Uh, hey, um...

503
00:36:46,732 --> 00:36:48,866
Your mother, she's
been calling the office

504
00:36:48,868 --> 00:36:52,069
10 times an hour, and
every time she calls,

505
00:36:52,071 --> 00:36:54,006
she calls the nurses The Help.

506
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:57,009
She's a peach.

507
00:36:58,077 --> 00:36:59,810
Thank you.

508
00:36:59,812 --> 00:37:03,546
Luke, you know I love
you, but do me a favor.

509
00:37:03,548 --> 00:37:06,984
Would you please talk to Sean?

510
00:37:06,986 --> 00:37:08,921
Everybody in the office
can feel the tension.

511
00:37:09,922 --> 00:37:11,690
Yeah, I'll get to it.

512
00:37:12,959 --> 00:37:15,027
That's not a request.

513
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,883
Hello?

514
00:37:52,865 --> 00:37:53,897
Hey.

515
00:37:53,899 --> 00:37:55,665
Are you okay?

516
00:37:55,667 --> 00:37:56,501
Yeah.

517
00:37:58,971 --> 00:38:00,006
Is that?

518
00:38:02,141 --> 00:38:03,275
This is James.

519
00:38:09,882 --> 00:38:11,250
It's just so unfair.

520
00:38:12,752 --> 00:38:14,120
I would have been
such a good mum.

521
00:38:16,122 --> 00:38:17,823
Why was he taken from me?

522
00:38:25,231 --> 00:38:28,868
Hey, hey, you didn't
do anything wrong.

523
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,215
We can't predict our future.

524
00:38:44,917 --> 00:38:49,321
We just try our damnedest to
make sure it's a good one.

525
00:38:50,923 --> 00:38:52,992
People like you do
not deserve to suffer.

526
00:38:56,195 --> 00:38:57,797
People like us.

527
00:39:00,266 --> 00:39:01,666
I am so sorry.

528
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:07,006
So embarrassing.

529
00:39:12,378 --> 00:39:15,948
Come with me, I wanna
show you something.

530
00:39:35,434 --> 00:39:38,003
I ask myself the same
questions all the time.

531
00:39:43,142 --> 00:39:46,443
What if I would've
seen the signs?

532
00:39:46,445 --> 00:39:47,947
If I could have saved her.

533
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:51,183
What if?

534
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:58,455
That's what I
live with everyday.

535
00:39:58,457 --> 00:39:59,291
What if?

536
00:41:58,077 --> 00:42:01,078
You guys, again, great
job, hospital's happy.

537
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,046
Hey, just keep it up,
talk to you later.

538
00:42:03,048 --> 00:42:04,581
- You have a nice one...
- Take care.

539
00:42:04,583 --> 00:42:05,751
Thank you.

540
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:08,485
Hey, Sean,

541
00:42:08,487 --> 00:42:10,153
wait up, man.

542
00:42:10,155 --> 00:42:13,156
So I am just in a bit of
a hurry to be a bad doctor.

543
00:42:13,158 --> 00:42:13,959
Look, stop for a second.

544
00:42:15,361 --> 00:42:19,129
I'm sorry, what I
said was uncalled for.

545
00:42:19,131 --> 00:42:20,063
You don't deserve that.

546
00:42:20,065 --> 00:42:21,066
That really sucked, man.

547
00:42:22,234 --> 00:42:23,867
I loved Jessica too, I mean...

548
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:24,568
I know, I know.

549
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:25,771
You guys are my...

550
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,473
You were my family.

551
00:42:29,475 --> 00:42:31,108
Now the only time I ever
hear anything about you

552
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:33,076
is through Sage's Facebook.

553
00:42:33,078 --> 00:42:35,045
How do you think that feels?

554
00:42:35,047 --> 00:42:38,282
I can't explain to you
how hard it's been for me.

555
00:42:38,284 --> 00:42:39,549
Can you just give me one...

556
00:42:39,551 --> 00:42:41,120
I don't wanna do
this here either, okay?

557
00:42:43,522 --> 00:42:46,992
You wanna talk, let's go have
a few beers and get real.

558
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,393
Right now?

559
00:42:49,395 --> 00:42:51,096
Never stopped us before.

560
00:42:53,065 --> 00:42:54,500
Will you clear my schedule?

561
00:42:58,103 --> 00:43:00,270
So Sage has a Facebook.

562
00:43:00,272 --> 00:43:02,241
Are you gonna
start lurking now?

563
00:43:12,017 --> 00:43:13,052
Uck.

564
00:43:13,986 --> 00:43:14,820
Now what?

565
00:43:21,026 --> 00:43:22,995
My little princess.

566
00:43:24,563 --> 00:43:25,831
Oh, look at you!

567
00:43:27,132 --> 00:43:30,901
Look how much you've
grown, so big!

568
00:43:30,903 --> 00:43:33,236
- Oh, sweetheart...
- Hi, Mrs. Matthews.

569
00:43:33,238 --> 00:43:34,638
Sage.

570
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,540
We just got back
from the park.

571
00:43:36,542 --> 00:43:40,010
Yep, she smells like she just
got back from the dog park.

572
00:43:40,012 --> 00:43:43,380
You need to change her diaper
as soon as she poops, dear.

573
00:43:43,382 --> 00:43:45,982
I was going to change
it before her nap.

574
00:43:45,984 --> 00:43:48,485
Well, why don't I just
change it for you now?

575
00:43:48,487 --> 00:43:50,589
I can change her
diaper, Mrs. Matthews.

576
00:43:52,224 --> 00:43:53,256
I hope you didn't take her

577
00:43:53,258 --> 00:43:55,492
to that park on Griffith Street.

578
00:43:55,494 --> 00:43:56,462
It's filled with homeless.

579
00:43:57,963 --> 00:43:59,363
I read in the paper
that they found

580
00:43:59,365 --> 00:44:02,933
more than 12 homeless
people living there.

581
00:44:02,935 --> 00:44:05,135
Filthy, just filthy.

582
00:44:05,137 --> 00:44:06,603
And you know what they do?

583
00:44:06,605 --> 00:44:08,605
I don't know what they do.

584
00:44:08,607 --> 00:44:11,141
They leave trash everywhere.

585
00:44:11,143 --> 00:44:12,544
Clothing, tents.

586
00:44:15,147 --> 00:44:17,714
Needles, it's disgusting.

587
00:44:17,716 --> 00:44:20,584
Wow, that really is something.

588
00:44:20,586 --> 00:44:23,987
I just think it would
be highly irresponsible

589
00:44:23,989 --> 00:44:26,058
for you to take
her to that park.

590
00:44:33,098 --> 00:44:34,698
So, a surprise visit, huh?

591
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:39,471
Mm-hm, I'm redecorating my
master bedroom and I will take

592
00:44:40,539 --> 00:44:44,510
any excuse to visit my princess.

593
00:44:45,745 --> 00:44:47,244
What time is dinner?

594
00:44:47,246 --> 00:44:48,712
Oh, well, Luke doesn't
get back till later

595
00:44:48,714 --> 00:44:50,647
and I was going to make
myself a salad and...

596
00:44:50,649 --> 00:44:54,050
Well, Sage, dear,
that won't work.

597
00:44:54,052 --> 00:44:55,020
Okay.

598
00:44:57,556 --> 00:44:59,055
You have a guest.

599
00:44:59,057 --> 00:45:00,056
You need to go to
the grocery store

600
00:45:00,058 --> 00:45:01,458
and get something to prepare.

601
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,126
I just got back from the
grocery store earlier...

602
00:45:03,128 --> 00:45:06,098
Well, good, that means it
must not be very far away.

603
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,499
Okay, well, I'll just
give Jessee her bottle

604
00:45:09,501 --> 00:45:11,168
and then be on my way.

605
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:13,637
It's almost four o'clock,
I can manage the bottle.

606
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:15,172
It's just if...

607
00:45:15,174 --> 00:45:16,442
I can handle it.

608
00:45:19,011 --> 00:45:21,211
Well, just be sure to
put her down afterwards,

609
00:45:21,213 --> 00:45:23,081
otherwise she'll
be up all night.

610
00:45:33,325 --> 00:45:35,160
You have a
nice night, ladies.

611
00:45:40,032 --> 00:45:41,331
You're the worst.

612
00:45:44,636 --> 00:45:46,438
It's good to hear
you laugh again.

613
00:45:47,807 --> 00:45:49,608
It's good to talk
about her again.

614
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:53,078
How you doing?

615
00:45:55,347 --> 00:45:57,216
Better, I think.

616
00:45:58,717 --> 00:46:01,353
Everything's been, I don't know,

617
00:46:02,287 --> 00:46:04,656
just blurry for so long.

618
00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:09,161
I wanted to be
there for you, man.

619
00:46:11,129 --> 00:46:12,998
I shouldn't have
pushed you away.

620
00:46:16,568 --> 00:46:17,469
It was kinda selfish.

621
00:46:19,071 --> 00:46:20,706
I just didn't know
how to talk to you.

622
00:46:21,841 --> 00:46:23,607
I saw your texts and your calls

623
00:46:23,609 --> 00:46:25,177
and I see you in the office.

624
00:46:27,179 --> 00:46:29,014
It just reminded me of Jessica.

625
00:46:34,086 --> 00:46:35,587
We've both been there, Luke.

626
00:46:37,089 --> 00:46:39,424
In that room where
it goes wrong.

627
00:46:41,527 --> 00:46:43,128
But when it's somebody you know,

628
00:46:47,132 --> 00:46:48,467
I really miss her too, man.

629
00:46:50,837 --> 00:46:53,672
And I really miss
having you around.

630
00:46:57,442 --> 00:46:58,243
I'm sorry.

631
00:47:00,512 --> 00:47:01,781
You're a good doctor.

632
00:47:09,655 --> 00:47:11,123
I had it all planned out.

633
00:47:12,491 --> 00:47:15,227
A good girl, a good
job, a good life.

634
00:47:16,763 --> 00:47:19,429
And when it was yanked
away from me, I just,

635
00:47:19,431 --> 00:47:22,167
I didn't feel worthy to
ever have that again.

636
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:25,671
Like it was my fault.

637
00:47:28,173 --> 00:47:29,207
And now?

638
00:47:34,313 --> 00:47:39,217
Hey, sometimes second chances
come in really weird ways.

639
00:47:43,923 --> 00:47:46,759
Jessee's definitely
my second chance.

640
00:47:48,293 --> 00:47:49,827
I bet having Sage
around to help is a bit

641
00:47:49,829 --> 00:47:51,263
of a breath of fresh air too.

642
00:47:53,699 --> 00:47:56,568
Yeah, more than you know.

643
00:47:57,837 --> 00:47:59,204
She's so good with Jessee.

644
00:48:00,439 --> 00:48:01,741
She cooks a mean steak,

645
00:48:02,842 --> 00:48:04,407
and most importantly,

646
00:48:04,409 --> 00:48:06,612
she doesn't put up with
Katharyn's attitude.

647
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:12,382
What?

648
00:48:12,384 --> 00:48:13,383
What, what's that?

649
00:48:13,385 --> 00:48:14,219
Nothing.

650
00:48:16,221 --> 00:48:17,790
Shut up and drink your beer.

651
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,692
This fish is interesting.

652
00:48:22,694 --> 00:48:24,194
It's mahi mahi.

653
00:48:24,196 --> 00:48:25,597
Hm, it's interesting.

654
00:48:27,265 --> 00:48:29,767
What time did you say
Luke was coming home?

655
00:48:29,769 --> 00:48:30,702
I didn't.

656
00:48:32,437 --> 00:48:36,206
Well, you do the dishes,

657
00:48:36,208 --> 00:48:38,976
I'm going to get some dessert
for my sweet princess.

658
00:48:38,978 --> 00:48:42,147
Well, actually we don't like
to feed her a lot of sweets.

659
00:48:42,849 --> 00:48:43,783
We.

660
00:48:45,885 --> 00:48:47,887
We don't like to give
her a lot of sweets.

661
00:48:49,554 --> 00:48:51,456
I think you should let
me be the Grandmother.

662
00:48:52,257 --> 00:48:53,623
I just think...

663
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:56,526
No, dear, it's not
your place to think.

664
00:48:56,528 --> 00:48:58,765
I've seen the way you
behave with this child.

665
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,968
- Excuse me?
- It's highly unprofessional.

666
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:07,004
You walk around like you
belong in this family.

667
00:49:07,006 --> 00:49:08,005
Mrs. Matthews...

668
00:49:08,007 --> 00:49:10,340
I know you lost your child.

669
00:49:10,342 --> 00:49:13,010
I talked to the Dunhills.

670
00:49:13,012 --> 00:49:16,914
They said they had to let you
go because you were depressed

671
00:49:16,916 --> 00:49:19,016
and unfit for the job.

672
00:49:19,018 --> 00:49:20,920
No.

673
00:49:21,888 --> 00:49:23,288
I'll take care of her.

674
00:49:24,791 --> 00:49:27,490
I'm reminded everyday
of what I lost.

675
00:49:27,492 --> 00:49:29,860
Well, that baby is not yours.

676
00:49:29,862 --> 00:49:33,898
And you are not going
to replace her mother.

677
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:35,233
- You...
- No!

678
00:49:37,804 --> 00:49:40,238
Pack your bags, you're done.

679
00:49:42,909 --> 00:49:47,914
What?

680
00:49:48,981 --> 00:49:49,914
Hey, let's do this again, huh?

681
00:49:49,916 --> 00:49:51,481
Absolutely.

682
00:49:51,483 --> 00:49:53,683
Less beers next time.

683
00:49:53,685 --> 00:49:54,854
All right, get home safe.

684
00:50:26,585 --> 00:50:27,652
Why are you here?

685
00:50:29,021 --> 00:50:31,621
I came to see
my granddaughter.

686
00:50:31,623 --> 00:50:32,992
I called but you didn't answer.

687
00:50:34,026 --> 00:50:36,526
Are you drunk?

688
00:50:36,528 --> 00:50:37,362
I'm fine.

689
00:50:42,769 --> 00:50:43,868
Where's Jessee?

690
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:46,005
It's late, I put her to bed.

691
00:50:47,907 --> 00:50:49,407
And I sent Sage away.

692
00:50:56,916 --> 00:50:58,483
I'm sorry, you did what?

693
00:51:00,753 --> 00:51:02,418
I sent her away.

694
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:06,090
I got tired of her finagling
her way into this family.

695
00:51:06,092 --> 00:51:07,524
- Jessee is not her...
- Mom!

696
00:51:07,526 --> 00:51:08,926
You need to stop.

697
00:51:08,928 --> 00:51:11,729
Luke, I did it for
you and for the baby.

698
00:51:11,731 --> 00:51:13,063
She is not a part
of this family.

699
00:51:13,065 --> 00:51:16,066
You didn't do for our family.

700
00:51:16,068 --> 00:51:18,468
Like everything else,
you did it for yourself.

701
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:19,304
Oh, Luke.

702
00:51:22,909 --> 00:51:24,775
You wanna know why
I pushed you away?

703
00:51:24,777 --> 00:51:26,511
I mean, ya gotta
be curious, right?

704
00:51:28,613 --> 00:51:30,415
You smothered me my entire life.

705
00:51:33,052 --> 00:51:34,551
Well, it must have worked

706
00:51:34,553 --> 00:51:35,953
because look how
good you turned out.

707
00:51:35,955 --> 00:51:39,992
Oh my God, you are
so arrogant sometimes.

708
00:51:42,929 --> 00:51:45,031
I turned out the way I
did because of Jessica.

709
00:51:47,033 --> 00:51:51,634
School, my business,
because of Jessica, not you.

710
00:51:51,636 --> 00:51:52,937
Well, Sage isn't Jessica.

711
00:51:52,939 --> 00:51:55,906
She's not your family
to control anymore.

712
00:51:55,908 --> 00:51:57,074
Where
are you going?

713
00:51:57,076 --> 00:51:58,044
To find Sage.

714
00:51:58,911 --> 00:51:59,912
Luke.

715
00:52:15,127 --> 00:52:20,132
Thanks for answering, I just
wanted someone to talk to.

716
00:52:22,201 --> 00:52:23,135
Well, it's perfect timing.

717
00:52:25,004 --> 00:52:27,039
We just got into town
for the show tomorrow.

718
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:29,608
You're coming, right?

719
00:52:38,818 --> 00:52:39,752
Sage, I'm sorry.

720
00:52:42,054 --> 00:52:46,025
I'm sorry I wasn't there
when you lost the baby.

721
00:52:47,592 --> 00:52:48,895
It was our baby.

722
00:52:49,996 --> 00:52:52,631
Yeah, yeah, our baby.

723
00:52:54,566 --> 00:52:55,799
I'm sorry.

724
00:52:55,801 --> 00:52:57,234
It's fine.

725
00:52:57,236 --> 00:52:58,603
No, it's not fine.

726
00:53:01,606 --> 00:53:03,608
I was confused, you know?

727
00:53:05,543 --> 00:53:07,947
I shoulda done a lot
better, Sage, and I'm sorry.

728
00:53:10,016 --> 00:53:12,517
And then to hear what
that woman said to you...

729
00:53:14,519 --> 00:53:17,021
One for you, miss,
one for you, sir.

730
00:53:17,023 --> 00:53:18,655
Thank you.

731
00:53:18,657 --> 00:53:21,928
Oh, Allen, I don't
drink anymore, not since...

732
00:53:23,095 --> 00:53:24,663
Come on, you're with me, babe.

733
00:53:25,965 --> 00:53:27,833
Make sure nothing
happens to you.

734
00:53:29,001 --> 00:53:30,202
Can't be scared of a drink.

735
00:53:31,938 --> 00:53:34,506
I was just alone for a
really long time after I was...

736
00:53:37,176 --> 00:53:39,879
Listen, you don't have
to explain that to me.

737
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,047
And after every show,

738
00:53:43,049 --> 00:53:44,982
I would wanna hear from you.

739
00:53:44,984 --> 00:53:48,584
I would get out my phone,
I would look at it,

740
00:53:48,586 --> 00:53:50,520
I would look at your number
and I would just stare at it

741
00:53:50,522 --> 00:53:51,924
and I'd wanna hear from you.

742
00:53:58,596 --> 00:54:00,766
And I just wouldn't do it.

743
00:54:02,234 --> 00:54:05,972
Guess life just got in the
way, you know what I mean?

744
00:54:07,605 --> 00:54:09,909
I mean I think it's
hard for him, it must be.

745
00:54:11,177 --> 00:54:12,644
I can only imagine
what it's like

746
00:54:14,246 --> 00:54:16,782
with his mother growing up, I
mean, it must have been hell.

747
00:54:18,084 --> 00:54:19,986
Your mother never
liked me much.

748
00:54:21,921 --> 00:54:22,755
Allen.

749
00:54:25,224 --> 00:54:26,726
I just miss feeling you.

750
00:54:30,262 --> 00:54:32,098
Come on, let's have
some fun tonight.

751
00:54:41,907 --> 00:54:43,207
Sage, hey, it's me.

752
00:54:43,209 --> 00:54:44,141
I don't know what
my mom said to you

753
00:54:44,143 --> 00:54:46,078
but please, call me back.

754
00:54:47,645 --> 00:54:49,915
Sir, do you know
where you wanna go?

755
00:54:52,985 --> 00:54:53,819
Not yet.

756
00:55:13,671 --> 00:55:16,976
Oh!

757
00:55:23,349 --> 00:55:25,715
I have a confession.

758
00:55:25,717 --> 00:55:28,052
Go ahead, what?

759
00:55:28,054 --> 00:55:29,088
What is it?

760
00:55:30,222 --> 00:55:32,655
I'm drunk.

761
00:55:32,657 --> 00:55:33,957
I'm drunk, I am...

762
00:55:33,959 --> 00:55:36,160
Oh, no, your
secret's safe with me.

763
00:55:36,162 --> 00:55:37,961
Shh.

764
00:55:37,963 --> 00:55:40,197
Just give yourself 10 Hail
Marys, it'll be all right.

765
00:55:40,199 --> 00:55:41,298
Hail Mary?

766
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,632
- Hail Mary.
- Hail Mary,

767
00:55:42,634 --> 00:55:43,967
Hail Mary.

768
00:55:43,969 --> 00:55:45,302
Sorry, guys, it's that
time, I'm closing up.

769
00:55:45,304 --> 00:55:47,905
Aw, come on, Tommy.

770
00:55:47,907 --> 00:55:51,308
We need mas tequila por favor.

771
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:52,943
Not tonight, bud.

772
00:55:52,945 --> 00:55:55,645
Come on, senor, give us
some more tequila, please?

773
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,014
- No, miss...
- Come on, buddy.

774
00:55:57,016 --> 00:55:57,850
You need a cab?

775
00:55:59,218 --> 00:56:00,618
Hey, she's fine, man.

776
00:56:01,821 --> 00:56:02,654
I'm a kitten.

777
00:56:05,124 --> 00:56:05,958
Allen?

778
00:56:07,993 --> 00:56:08,959
What's wrong with him?

779
00:56:08,961 --> 00:56:11,028
Maybe I should get going.

780
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:13,764
No, no, come on, we're
just reconnecting, it's fun.

781
00:56:13,766 --> 00:56:16,068
It is fun, but...

782
00:56:18,971 --> 00:56:20,739
I'm only here
for one more night.

783
00:56:22,108 --> 00:56:22,942
Let's hang out.

784
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:27,947
Let me just make
one call, one call.

785
00:56:29,915 --> 00:56:30,950
- Okay.
- Okay.

786
00:56:32,818 --> 00:56:33,884
Okay, one call.

787
00:56:33,886 --> 00:56:35,054
- Okay.
- Okay.

788
00:56:46,966 --> 00:56:48,065
Sage.

789
00:56:48,067 --> 00:56:50,901
Hey, sorry for
calling so late.

790
00:56:50,903 --> 00:56:52,704
It's no problem, where you at?

791
00:56:53,472 --> 00:56:54,972
Hey, Sage,

792
00:56:54,974 --> 00:56:57,407
we gotta go, Tommy's
kickin' us out.

793
00:56:57,409 --> 00:56:58,177
Ma'am, Tommy's.

794
00:57:00,813 --> 00:57:01,845
- Luke, I need to go...
- I'm going.

795
00:57:01,847 --> 00:57:03,113
I'll call you later.

796
00:57:03,115 --> 00:57:04,283
I'll be right there.

797
00:57:07,019 --> 00:57:07,853
Are you ready?

798
00:57:10,356 --> 00:57:13,092
Actually, I, I can't.

799
00:57:14,093 --> 00:57:16,460
Come on, you can come over

800
00:57:16,462 --> 00:57:18,962
and you can tell me
about your horrible boss.

801
00:57:18,964 --> 00:57:20,330
He's not horrible.

802
00:57:20,332 --> 00:57:23,903
Eh, whatever, it'll
be like old times.

803
00:57:25,271 --> 00:57:28,405
Actually, Tommy,
I will get that cab.

804
00:57:28,407 --> 00:57:31,177
Hold on, one minute you're
all over me over there and,

805
00:57:32,378 --> 00:57:34,044
suddenly you're not gonna...

806
00:57:34,046 --> 00:57:35,979
Hey, pal, I think
she's fine on her own.

807
00:57:35,981 --> 00:57:38,048
Hey, why don't you
mind your business, man?

808
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:39,349
- I'm calling the cops.
- Hey...

809
00:57:39,351 --> 00:57:40,984
Yeah, whatever, you call 'em.

810
00:57:40,986 --> 00:57:42,953
Allen, you need to let go.

811
00:57:42,955 --> 00:57:46,223
Yeah, you know, this is why
I left you in the first place.

812
00:57:46,225 --> 00:57:47,424
You know that?

813
00:57:47,426 --> 00:57:48,959
'Cause you can never get a grip

814
00:57:48,961 --> 00:57:50,260
on what's right in front of you.

815
00:57:50,262 --> 00:57:51,762
No.

816
00:57:51,764 --> 00:57:53,063
I'm right in front
of you, baby, I'm here,

817
00:57:53,065 --> 00:57:53,964
- I'm here tonight.
- Let go, let go!

818
00:57:53,966 --> 00:57:55,332
Come on, please, come.

819
00:57:55,334 --> 00:57:59,136
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, get off her.

820
00:57:59,138 --> 00:57:59,972
Luke?

821
00:58:01,006 --> 00:58:03,342
Luke.

822
00:58:05,077 --> 00:58:06,111
What, is this the new me?

823
00:58:08,981 --> 00:58:11,984
Blonde-haired,
blue-eyed, preppy-ass me?

824
00:58:13,452 --> 00:58:14,420
Hey, you know what?

825
00:58:17,122 --> 00:58:19,724
You can have that little
Aussie girl, you know what?

826
00:58:23,529 --> 00:58:26,365
'Cause I don't
have time for this.

827
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:33,339
Face for this,
I don't have time for this.

828
00:58:35,908 --> 00:58:39,142
I don't have time for
this!

829
00:58:39,144 --> 00:58:40,246
Are you okay?

830
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,146
I'm really sorry about that.

831
00:58:43,148 --> 00:58:44,383
It's all right.

832
00:58:53,158 --> 00:58:55,292
Katharyn, she didn't
have the right.

833
00:58:55,294 --> 00:58:57,129
It's okay, I
think she was right.

834
00:58:58,163 --> 00:58:59,963
I got too comfortable.

835
00:58:59,965 --> 00:59:01,265
Too comfortable?

836
00:59:01,267 --> 00:59:03,967
When I lost my
baby I was drifting.

837
00:59:03,969 --> 00:59:07,339
And then you and Jessee came
along and it was like a family.

838
00:59:08,941 --> 00:59:11,241
But it wasn't my family,
it wasn't meant for me.

839
00:59:11,243 --> 00:59:12,478
- Sage...
- Listen,

840
00:59:14,113 --> 00:59:18,083
I love Jessee, I love her
with my whole heart but,

841
00:59:19,184 --> 00:59:22,085
I think I have to go.

842
00:59:22,087 --> 00:59:24,121
I think that's
a horrible idea.

843
00:59:24,123 --> 00:59:25,522
What?

844
00:59:25,524 --> 00:59:27,924
I don't accept your
resignation, ma'am.

845
00:59:27,926 --> 00:59:30,460
Well, I don't think
that's how this works.

846
00:59:30,462 --> 00:59:34,131
Okay, why don't
you sleep on it?

847
00:59:34,133 --> 00:59:36,066
I'll take off tomorrow
and watch Jessee.

848
00:59:36,068 --> 00:59:39,303
If you wake up in the morning,
you feel the same way,

849
00:59:39,305 --> 00:59:40,172
I won't stop you.

850
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:43,976
Sleep on it.

851
00:59:49,982 --> 00:59:50,784
Huh.

852
01:00:30,089 --> 01:00:31,156
Good morning, Sage.

853
01:00:32,925 --> 01:00:33,559
Hi.

854
01:00:35,194 --> 01:00:37,262
I didn't know how
you liked your coffee.

855
01:00:38,263 --> 01:00:40,132
Black is fine, thanks.

856
01:00:42,368 --> 01:00:43,934
How did you sleep?

857
01:00:43,936 --> 01:00:45,037
Where's Luke and Jessee?

858
01:00:46,338 --> 01:00:47,239
He took her out.

859
01:00:51,176 --> 01:00:54,012
I was hoping to tell him that
today would be my last day.

860
01:00:55,447 --> 01:00:58,014
Yeah, he told me this morning

861
01:00:58,016 --> 01:00:59,983
that that's what
you were thinking.

862
01:00:59,985 --> 01:01:02,519
Well, there it is.

863
01:01:02,521 --> 01:01:03,520
Why don't you sit.

864
01:01:03,522 --> 01:01:04,223
I'll stand.

865
01:01:05,958 --> 01:01:09,228
Sit, please, dear, it's
just coffee, it doesn't bite.

866
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,369
Did you know that I hated
Jessica in the beginning?

867
01:01:18,203 --> 01:01:19,037
It's true.

868
01:01:20,706 --> 01:01:22,506
Luke was a wild child
when he met her.

869
01:01:22,508 --> 01:01:27,413
He was hanging out with
riffraff and hellraisers,

870
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:29,481
and then he met this girl.

871
01:01:31,116 --> 01:01:35,521
She was nice, she was
beautiful, she was educated.

872
01:01:37,156 --> 01:01:40,058
She gave him a reason to
get serious about school,

873
01:01:41,326 --> 01:01:42,327
get his degree.

874
01:01:45,732 --> 01:01:46,932
I'm not following.

875
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:49,101
I hated it.

876
01:01:51,003 --> 01:01:54,373
For the first time in his
life there was someone

877
01:01:55,674 --> 01:01:59,144
who wasn't me that
made him happy.

878
01:02:01,113 --> 01:02:03,115
It was her that he
wanted to please.

879
01:02:04,516 --> 01:02:05,317
Well...

880
01:02:07,419 --> 01:02:11,789
From the time Luke's dad
died, for a long time after,

881
01:02:11,791 --> 01:02:13,523
it was just the two of us.

882
01:02:13,525 --> 01:02:15,594
I held onto him really tightly.

883
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:21,667
And then to see this
woman take my place, I...

884
01:02:23,803 --> 01:02:24,735
It broke my heart.

885
01:02:24,737 --> 01:02:26,004
Is this going somewhere?

886
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:34,012
The way I've treated you
has not been very polite.

887
01:02:36,215 --> 01:02:38,081
And I realized last night

888
01:02:38,083 --> 01:02:40,150
that the reason I've
treated you that way

889
01:02:40,152 --> 01:02:42,154
is because you remind me of her.

890
01:02:44,590 --> 01:02:48,091
You have become important
to the two people

891
01:02:48,093 --> 01:02:50,996
that I care most
about in my life and,

892
01:02:52,498 --> 01:02:57,069
I was just worried that there
wouldn't be room for me.

893
01:03:00,205 --> 01:03:01,540
I don't know what to say.

894
01:03:03,843 --> 01:03:06,777
Luke told me about
the man you were with.

895
01:03:06,779 --> 01:03:08,612
I wish I'd been there.

896
01:03:08,614 --> 01:03:10,080
I would have let
him know how we deal

897
01:03:10,082 --> 01:03:12,050
with things like
that on the ranch.

898
01:03:17,422 --> 01:03:19,157
Luke and Jessee love you

899
01:03:22,094 --> 01:03:23,629
and I lied about the Dunhills.

900
01:03:25,097 --> 01:03:25,732
Shocking.

901
01:03:29,736 --> 01:03:32,369
They were really
sorry to lose you,

902
01:03:32,371 --> 01:03:35,305
and they told that you'd
become a part of the family

903
01:03:35,307 --> 01:03:38,341
and that you used to take
the boys to ride horses.

904
01:03:38,343 --> 01:03:41,746
Now, why didn't you put
that on your resume?

905
01:03:41,748 --> 01:03:43,413
I don't know.

906
01:03:43,415 --> 01:03:47,484
Well, horses and I go
together like steak and sauce.

907
01:03:50,389 --> 01:03:52,124
Let me make it up to you.

908
01:03:53,893 --> 01:03:56,361
When's the last time you
had a girls' day out?

909
01:03:58,664 --> 01:04:00,263
Never.

910
01:04:00,265 --> 01:04:03,834
Go get dressed, I'm
taking you with me.

911
01:04:03,836 --> 01:04:05,537
Today you're mine.

912
01:04:09,141 --> 01:04:09,742
Okay.

913
01:04:51,818 --> 01:04:54,787
I'm ready
to go, Mrs. Matthews.

914
01:04:57,589 --> 01:04:59,924
I'll be right there.

915
01:05:20,212 --> 01:05:22,247
Looking more and
more like her everyday.

916
01:05:23,315 --> 01:05:25,118
She woulda spoiled you rotten.

917
01:05:28,988 --> 01:05:32,190
She was so excited when she
found out we were having a girl.

918
01:05:34,526 --> 01:05:36,495
I was pretty scared,
to be honest.

919
01:05:44,904 --> 01:05:46,605
Can I tell you something?

920
01:05:48,741 --> 01:05:50,509
I'm scared I can't
live up to that.

921
01:05:52,945 --> 01:05:55,748
It's been pretty hard on your
dad not having your mom here.

922
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:59,551
I haven't been home much.

923
01:06:00,953 --> 01:06:04,556
When I am home, I've
been ignoring you.

924
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:08,694
I'm sorry.

925
01:06:11,898 --> 01:06:12,932
But I'm gonna get better.

926
01:06:14,566 --> 01:06:15,701
It's gonna be better.

927
01:06:17,937 --> 01:06:18,771
Promise.

928
01:06:19,906 --> 01:06:20,940
Boop.

929
01:06:35,988 --> 01:06:37,222
All right,

930
01:06:38,356 --> 01:06:41,992
mm-hm

931
01:06:41,994 --> 01:06:43,662
get ready for the...

932
01:06:45,832 --> 01:06:47,232
Mashed peas and squash.

933
01:06:52,839 --> 01:06:53,672
Oh, God, oh, no.

934
01:06:55,307 --> 01:06:56,843
Let's get you something
better to eat, baby girl.

935
01:06:59,644 --> 01:07:00,479
Whoa.

936
01:07:01,948 --> 01:07:03,248
I mean, wow.

937
01:07:05,885 --> 01:07:07,486
Thanks, I think.

938
01:07:08,955 --> 01:07:10,022
Your mum took me out.

939
01:07:11,389 --> 01:07:13,523
And now I'm gonna take Jessee

940
01:07:13,525 --> 01:07:15,960
and get you cleaned up.

941
01:07:15,962 --> 01:07:18,628
Come here, my sweetheart, whew!

942
01:07:25,037 --> 01:07:26,471
You're staring.

943
01:07:27,774 --> 01:07:28,607
Sorry.

944
01:07:29,876 --> 01:07:31,909
I just, you look different.

945
01:07:31,911 --> 01:07:33,780
I'll take that
as a compliment.

946
01:07:34,814 --> 01:07:36,013
It is.

947
01:07:36,015 --> 01:07:38,983
Your mum and I
had a nice talk.

948
01:07:38,985 --> 01:07:40,552
We've found some common ground.

949
01:07:41,788 --> 01:07:42,987
Like what?

950
01:07:42,989 --> 01:07:45,290
We both love that little girl.

951
01:07:47,392 --> 01:07:49,059
Does this mean that...

952
01:07:49,061 --> 01:07:51,394
Yeah, I'm gonna stay.

953
01:07:51,396 --> 01:07:53,764
Okay, good.

954
01:07:53,766 --> 01:07:56,934
And I'm gonna try to
be home more often.

955
01:07:56,936 --> 01:07:58,635
Yeah, good.

956
01:07:58,637 --> 01:07:59,272
Good.

957
01:08:00,773 --> 01:08:02,973
It'll make us both really happy.

958
01:08:06,746 --> 01:08:07,677
Where are the diapers?

959
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:09,849
Oh, I can show you.

960
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,560
All right, how 'bout...

961
01:08:23,562 --> 01:08:26,163
Oh, no, not that one,
she won't eat the carrots.

962
01:08:26,165 --> 01:08:29,733
You need the banana
and split pea.

963
01:08:29,735 --> 01:08:33,971
All right, I can't wait
to feed this baby a steak.

964
01:08:33,973 --> 01:08:34,807
Steak.

965
01:08:37,944 --> 01:08:40,878
So, I was thinking...

966
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,146
Of giving me a raise.

967
01:08:42,148 --> 01:08:44,048
Close.

968
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:46,649
How 'bout a night off?

969
01:08:46,651 --> 01:08:47,987
Huh, details, sir.

970
01:08:49,588 --> 01:08:51,021
I have this banquet
I go to every year

971
01:08:51,023 --> 01:08:53,556
for the OB-GYNs
and I thought maybe

972
01:08:53,558 --> 01:08:56,494
if you wanted to go,
we could go together.

973
01:08:57,964 --> 01:09:01,131
Well, I don't have anything
that nice to wear and,

974
01:09:01,133 --> 01:09:03,734
I mean, isn't that kind of...

975
01:09:03,736 --> 01:09:04,935
Boring?

976
01:09:04,937 --> 01:09:06,804
Lame, square?

977
01:09:06,806 --> 01:09:07,439
Nailed it.

978
01:09:08,808 --> 01:09:10,007
Why don't we come
up with a codeword

979
01:09:10,009 --> 01:09:11,509
in case we get too bored?

980
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:15,578
Mm-hm.

981
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:16,579
All right, well,
I will pick you up

982
01:09:16,581 --> 01:09:17,917
at your bedroom door at 8 p.m.

983
01:09:21,988 --> 01:09:25,655
Okay, so I have all the
necessary information right here.

984
01:09:25,657 --> 01:09:27,992
If you need anything,
please call me.

985
01:09:27,994 --> 01:09:29,793
You don't need
to worry about us.

986
01:09:29,795 --> 01:09:31,731
We're gonna catch up
on the Kardashians.

987
01:09:32,497 --> 01:09:33,831
Perfect.

988
01:09:33,833 --> 01:09:35,165
You know, you two
better get going.

989
01:09:35,167 --> 01:09:36,936
You're gonna miss
out on the open bar.

990
01:09:37,937 --> 01:09:40,039
I'm ready for my closeup.

991
01:09:42,942 --> 01:09:44,609
I think that's what they say.

992
01:09:46,478 --> 01:09:48,178
You look incredible.

993
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:51,081
Where'd you get the dress?

994
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:51,984
I had some help.

995
01:09:55,054 --> 01:09:55,922
You're welcome.

996
01:10:01,626 --> 01:10:04,494
Nice to see
you, how are you?

997
01:10:04,496 --> 01:10:06,065
Great, wonderful,
having a good time?

998
01:10:09,068 --> 01:10:12,169
I feel out of place.

999
01:10:12,171 --> 01:10:15,105
Is it because you're the
youngest one here by 15 years?

1000
01:10:16,742 --> 01:10:18,610
I'll give you the lay
of the land, come on.

1001
01:10:21,147 --> 01:10:24,114
All right, that there
is Dr. Hamilton.

1002
01:10:24,116 --> 01:10:27,086
He gets handsy after a
few drinks, so be careful.

1003
01:10:31,556 --> 01:10:35,625
Okay, this guy here,
this is Dr. Pearson.

1004
01:10:35,627 --> 01:10:37,660
The young lady he's
with is his fifth wife.

1005
01:10:37,662 --> 01:10:38,963
He met her while vacationing

1006
01:10:38,965 --> 01:10:41,599
in the Bahamas with
his fourth wife.

1007
01:10:43,069 --> 01:10:46,703
Wow, quite the spread of
colleagues you have here.

1008
01:10:46,705 --> 01:10:47,340
Mm-hm.

1009
01:10:49,008 --> 01:10:51,842
That guy there in the cool suit,

1010
01:10:51,844 --> 01:10:53,110
Two shots.

1011
01:10:53,112 --> 01:10:54,945
- Shots, go!
- That is my business partner

1012
01:10:54,947 --> 01:10:56,048
doing shots.

1013
01:10:58,150 --> 01:10:59,083
That'll put hair
on your chest.

1014
01:10:59,085 --> 01:11:00,184
That was so strong.

1015
01:11:00,186 --> 01:11:01,752
- Nice.
- I hope not.

1016
01:11:01,754 --> 01:11:03,954
The codeword for
tonight is disco dust.

1017
01:11:03,956 --> 01:11:04,955
Disco dust?

1018
01:11:04,957 --> 01:11:07,191
Shh.

1019
01:11:07,193 --> 01:11:09,860
Luke Matthews, glad to see
you came out of your cave.

1020
01:11:09,862 --> 01:11:11,328
Dr. Price, I knew you
wouldn't miss an open bar.

1021
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:13,696
Ah, it's the only good
thing about these things.

1022
01:11:14,734 --> 01:11:16,000
You remember my wife.

1023
01:11:16,002 --> 01:11:17,201
Yes, of course,
Emily, nice to see you.

1024
01:11:17,203 --> 01:11:18,869
This is Sage.

1025
01:11:18,871 --> 01:11:19,870
Good day.

1026
01:11:19,872 --> 01:11:21,138
It's a pleasure to meet you.

1027
01:11:21,140 --> 01:11:22,705
We just wanted to
stop and say hi.

1028
01:11:22,707 --> 01:11:24,709
I'm glad you did,
see you guys around.

1029
01:11:26,112 --> 01:11:27,945
Didn't
his wife just die?

1030
01:11:27,947 --> 01:11:30,014
And he's already
with someone else?

1031
01:11:30,016 --> 01:11:32,216
Mrs. Price, can you
speak up a little bit?

1032
01:11:32,218 --> 01:11:33,718
We couldn't quite hear ya.

1033
01:11:35,254 --> 01:11:37,254
Ooh, disco dust, disco dust.

1034
01:11:37,256 --> 01:11:39,256
Nah, don't worry about her.

1035
01:11:39,258 --> 01:11:42,760
She likes to borrow pills
from her husband's office.

1036
01:11:42,762 --> 01:11:44,061
- Oh.
- Mm-hm.

1037
01:11:44,063 --> 01:11:45,865
I need a drink.

1038
01:11:46,899 --> 01:11:47,800
You and me both.

1039
01:11:52,138 --> 01:11:54,204
Hi, I'm Sage.

1040
01:11:54,206 --> 01:11:56,073
I'm Kelli, with an I.

1041
01:11:56,075 --> 01:11:57,810
Oh, hi, Kelli with an I.

1042
01:12:03,749 --> 01:12:05,983
So how long have you
and Sean been together?

1043
01:12:05,985 --> 01:12:07,351
Who?

1044
01:12:07,353 --> 01:12:10,854
Oh, Sean, we met a couple
months ago at the gym.

1045
01:12:10,856 --> 01:12:12,622
Oh, at the gym.

1046
01:12:12,624 --> 01:12:14,994
I tried going there once
and decided to take a nap.

1047
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:31,641
So, what about you and
that other hot doctor?

1048
01:12:31,643 --> 01:12:33,077
Oh, us?

1049
01:12:33,079 --> 01:12:36,013
No, nothing, I'm just
his daughter's nanny.

1050
01:12:36,015 --> 01:12:37,750
Oh, that's boring.

1051
01:12:40,319 --> 01:12:42,219
Wanna do shots?

1052
01:12:42,221 --> 01:12:44,121
Uh, maybe, yeah.

1053
01:12:44,123 --> 01:12:45,089
You know they're free, right?

1054
01:12:45,091 --> 01:12:46,656
You don't even have to tip.

1055
01:12:46,658 --> 01:12:48,258
It's the best, I can get
like three, four, five,

1056
01:12:48,260 --> 01:12:49,993
how many do you want?

1057
01:12:49,995 --> 01:12:51,694
Yeah, let's, okay.

1058
01:12:51,696 --> 01:12:53,097
I like you, Sage.

1059
01:12:53,099 --> 01:12:56,333
Thanks, Kelli with an I.

1060
01:12:56,335 --> 01:12:58,135
So what's up
with you and Kelli?

1061
01:12:58,137 --> 01:13:01,038
Mm-mm, don't judge until you
see her work the pull-up bar.

1062
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:04,707
No, come on, the
real question is

1063
01:13:04,709 --> 01:13:06,112
what's going on with you two?

1064
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:09,079
Not a thing.

1065
01:13:09,081 --> 01:13:11,148
Come on, Matthews.

1066
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:12,850
This coy little game
you're playing is cute

1067
01:13:12,852 --> 01:13:13,819
but you can't fool me.

1068
01:13:14,854 --> 01:13:16,686
I see the way you look at her.

1069
01:13:16,688 --> 01:13:18,055
I mean, she looks good.

1070
01:13:18,057 --> 01:13:18,891
Smells good.

1071
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:24,027
But she's my
employee, that's it.

1072
01:13:27,066 --> 01:13:28,234
You're making me sober.

1073
01:13:32,471 --> 01:13:34,206
I think you have
a drinking problem.

1074
01:13:36,876 --> 01:13:38,942
Oh, there you are.

1075
01:13:38,944 --> 01:13:42,146
I was try to escape
Kelli with an I.

1076
01:13:42,148 --> 01:13:44,081
Yeah, she's somethin'.

1077
01:13:44,083 --> 01:13:46,049
Yep.

1078
01:13:46,051 --> 01:13:47,017
Come on.

1079
01:13:47,019 --> 01:13:48,118
Uh, where?

1080
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:49,486
Come on.

1081
01:13:49,488 --> 01:13:52,222
I can't dance, I have
cinder blocks for feet.

1082
01:13:52,224 --> 01:13:54,960
You will be great.

1083
01:13:56,328 --> 01:14:00,297
Well, I feel like
the unpopular girl

1084
01:14:00,299 --> 01:14:03,066
at high school dancing
with the quarterback.

1085
01:14:03,068 --> 01:14:05,269
That's silly, I
played baseball.

1086
01:14:05,271 --> 01:14:06,303
Really?

1087
01:14:06,305 --> 01:14:08,340
Yeah, my whole life, actually.

1088
01:14:09,308 --> 01:14:10,943
Mom wanted a sports star.

1089
01:14:11,911 --> 01:14:13,410
How 'bout you?

1090
01:14:13,412 --> 01:14:16,813
Oh, no sports for me,
I was too punk for that.

1091
01:14:16,815 --> 01:14:19,883
I was all about loud
music and horses.

1092
01:14:19,885 --> 01:14:20,951
Horses?

1093
01:14:20,953 --> 01:14:22,452
That doesn't sound very punk.

1094
01:14:22,454 --> 01:14:26,390
Oh, but barrel racing
is.

1095
01:14:26,392 --> 01:14:29,361
It's like the music,
controlled chaos.

1096
01:14:31,096 --> 01:14:35,199
Hm, must be a lot of space
to ride around in Australia.

1097
01:14:35,201 --> 01:14:38,137
You have no idea,
it is so beautiful.

1098
01:14:47,313 --> 01:14:48,078
Hey.

1099
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,079
Hi.

1100
01:14:49,081 --> 01:14:50,514
Just havin' a party, people.

1101
01:14:50,516 --> 01:14:52,482
Hey, we're thinking about
getting out of here.

1102
01:14:52,484 --> 01:14:54,151
You guys interested?

1103
01:14:54,153 --> 01:14:57,056
Yeah, there is this really
rad club down the street.

1104
01:14:57,957 --> 01:14:59,056
Yeah?

1105
01:14:59,058 --> 01:15:01,126
Is the club called disco dust?

1106
01:15:02,061 --> 01:15:03,460
Yes.

1107
01:15:03,462 --> 01:15:04,363
I don't get it.

1108
01:15:32,858 --> 01:15:35,325
Uh,

1109
01:15:35,327 --> 01:15:37,594
we should get inside,
check on Jessee.

1110
01:15:37,596 --> 01:15:39,029
Well, Michelle's with Jessee

1111
01:15:39,031 --> 01:15:41,331
and I'm sure she's
asleep by now.

1112
01:15:41,333 --> 01:15:43,902
We need to, we should
just get inside, you know?

1113
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:46,438
Did I do something?

1114
01:15:48,941 --> 01:15:49,875
What is it?

1115
01:15:53,912 --> 01:15:55,381
I keep seeing her.

1116
01:15:56,315 --> 01:15:57,383
Who?

1117
01:15:59,418 --> 01:16:00,252
Jessica.

1118
01:16:04,390 --> 01:16:05,922
If it would have been up to me,

1119
01:16:05,924 --> 01:16:07,891
we would have lived in
that apartment forever.

1120
01:16:10,062 --> 01:16:12,498
This whole house was
just her brainchild.

1121
01:16:14,033 --> 01:16:15,265
Being in the desert
made her feel

1122
01:16:15,267 --> 01:16:17,002
like we lived in the Old West.

1123
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:19,970
She sounds really great.

1124
01:16:19,972 --> 01:16:20,572
She was.

1125
01:16:23,042 --> 01:16:24,109
When I first met her, I was

1126
01:16:25,544 --> 01:16:28,514
always looking for the
next beer run party.

1127
01:16:30,082 --> 01:16:32,584
She got me focused,
pushed me to be a doctor.

1128
01:16:34,219 --> 01:16:36,255
And I just assumed you
loved the female anatomy.

1129
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:39,858
Sounds kinda cheesy but,

1130
01:16:41,327 --> 01:16:43,193
I became an OB because
I just loved the idea

1131
01:16:43,195 --> 01:16:46,563
of being there when
a family starts.

1132
01:16:46,565 --> 01:16:48,598
Seeing that look
on a father's face

1133
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:49,601
when he first sees his child.

1134
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:53,170
Or the relief a mother
has when you tell her

1135
01:16:53,172 --> 01:16:56,008
that she has a very
happy, healthy baby.

1136
01:16:57,109 --> 01:16:58,243
Nothing quite like it.

1137
01:16:59,211 --> 01:17:01,246
Well, Dr. Matthews,

1138
01:17:02,581 --> 01:17:04,616
you do have a soft
side under there.

1139
01:17:05,651 --> 01:17:08,018
Yeah, somewhere under there.

1140
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:09,353
How 'bout you?

1141
01:17:09,355 --> 01:17:12,122
All I know about you is
that you are an Aussie

1142
01:17:12,124 --> 01:17:14,091
and you used to ride horses.

1143
01:17:14,093 --> 01:17:16,193
Every weekend
when I was a kid,

1144
01:17:16,195 --> 01:17:17,961
my dad taught me to barrel race

1145
01:17:17,963 --> 01:17:21,600
and I loved it so much
that I started competing.

1146
01:17:23,102 --> 01:17:24,067
Like a real cowgirl.

1147
01:17:24,069 --> 01:17:26,002
Yes, like a real cowgirl.

1148
01:17:26,004 --> 01:17:26,438
Hm.

1149
01:17:28,006 --> 01:17:31,477
The summer I sold my
horses was really rough.

1150
01:17:33,011 --> 01:17:34,211
My mum moved back
here to the states

1151
01:17:34,213 --> 01:17:35,679
and my dad stayed in Adelaide

1152
01:17:35,681 --> 01:17:38,648
and he had to sell the
horses just to get by,

1153
01:17:38,650 --> 01:17:40,119
and that was that.

1154
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:43,120
I buried myself in music,

1155
01:17:43,122 --> 01:17:46,992
and my horses just
became a faded memory.

1156
01:17:47,993 --> 01:17:51,096
So the cowgirl has a past.

1157
01:17:52,464 --> 01:17:53,298
Yeah.

1158
01:17:55,601 --> 01:17:59,238
You don't have to
answer this but, Allen?

1159
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:02,174
Yeah.

1160
01:18:03,642 --> 01:18:06,243
Girls like bad guys, I guess.

1161
01:18:06,245 --> 01:18:07,577
Mm-hm.

1162
01:18:07,579 --> 01:18:10,514
Mm-hm, I met him
back home at a show

1163
01:18:10,516 --> 01:18:14,050
when his band was doing
smaller opening acts,

1164
01:18:14,052 --> 01:18:16,321
and at first, I was just
another girl to him.

1165
01:18:17,356 --> 01:18:19,156
Then he made me feel special.

1166
01:18:19,158 --> 01:18:23,026
Dedicated songs to me onstage,
winked at me during solos.

1167
01:18:23,028 --> 01:18:23,595
I loved it.

1168
01:18:25,264 --> 01:18:28,033
Then I followed him to the
states when he got signed.

1169
01:18:31,203 --> 01:18:33,138
And then he changed, real quick.

1170
01:18:35,174 --> 01:18:37,374
Our late nights became
his late nights.

1171
01:18:37,376 --> 01:18:40,012
He stopped sleeping on the
bus and disappeared a lot.

1172
01:18:42,014 --> 01:18:43,048
Then I got pregnant.

1173
01:18:44,583 --> 01:18:48,151
Yeah, and he adopted
the rockstar lifestyle.

1174
01:18:48,153 --> 01:18:50,489
Yeah, things became
too real, he said.

1175
01:18:52,090 --> 01:18:54,259
Needed to work on
touring and his work.

1176
01:18:55,694 --> 01:18:58,428
He said he'd send me
money and I'd be set.

1177
01:18:58,430 --> 01:19:01,097
Until the other night,
the last I saw him

1178
01:19:01,099 --> 01:19:04,067
or heard from him was
when the bus pulled out

1179
01:19:04,069 --> 01:19:05,037
and he headed east.

1180
01:19:08,307 --> 01:19:10,175
Why are men so horrible?

1181
01:19:11,376 --> 01:19:14,177
Let's face it, we're jerks.

1182
01:19:14,179 --> 01:19:16,749
Well, present company
excluded, obviously.

1183
01:19:18,717 --> 01:19:23,286
I left voicemails,
and emails and texts.

1184
01:19:23,288 --> 01:19:25,188
And I'm about three months along

1185
01:19:25,190 --> 01:19:27,760
and he tells me I
shouldn't call him anymore.

1186
01:19:28,828 --> 01:19:31,129
I'm upsetting his artistic flow.

1187
01:19:31,831 --> 01:19:32,431
Such a load.

1188
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:36,166
You never wanted to show up

1189
01:19:36,168 --> 01:19:38,101
to one of his concerts
and call him out?

1190
01:19:38,103 --> 01:19:39,536
What's the point?

1191
01:19:39,538 --> 01:19:41,839
I make a scene, it
makes me look crazy

1192
01:19:41,841 --> 01:19:43,375
and I'm still left alone.

1193
01:19:44,744 --> 01:19:47,513
I just wanna start over,
clean slate, you know?

1194
01:19:53,218 --> 01:19:54,386
Let's get you inside.

1195
01:20:05,097 --> 01:20:07,199
- Look who's here!
- Hi!

1196
01:20:09,167 --> 01:20:10,333
Hey, guys.

1197
01:20:10,335 --> 01:20:11,334
Hi, good to see you again.

1198
01:20:11,336 --> 01:20:12,369
Nice to see you.

1199
01:20:12,371 --> 01:20:13,603
Look at you, hi!

1200
01:20:13,605 --> 01:20:14,704
How you doing?

1201
01:20:14,706 --> 01:20:17,374
- Good.
- Ooh, oh, yeah.

1202
01:20:21,413 --> 01:20:22,579
- Oh my goodness!
- Hi.

1203
01:20:24,349 --> 01:20:28,718
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

1204
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:32,255
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

1205
01:20:32,257 --> 01:20:37,193
♪ Happy Birthday dear Jessee ♪

1206
01:20:37,195 --> 01:20:41,164
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

1207
01:21:12,164 --> 01:21:13,597
So I was thinking about
what you were saying

1208
01:21:13,599 --> 01:21:15,233
and now wanted to
see if it was true.

1209
01:21:16,635 --> 01:21:20,704
Sage, this is Texas,
Texas, this is Sage.

1210
01:21:20,706 --> 01:21:23,340
Whoa, he is beautiful.

1211
01:21:23,342 --> 01:21:24,674
He's yours all day.

1212
01:21:24,676 --> 01:21:27,212
A patient of mine owns
the place and he said...

1213
01:21:29,849 --> 01:21:32,217
You have no idea
what this means to me.

1214
01:21:34,887 --> 01:21:37,487
Let's see what you got.

1215
01:21:37,489 --> 01:21:38,490
Hi.

1216
01:22:56,535 --> 01:22:57,768
Mom?

1217
01:22:57,770 --> 01:23:00,037
- Oh, God, hey!
- I'll get Jessee.

1218
01:23:00,039 --> 01:23:01,373
Hey, you okay?

1219
01:23:03,042 --> 01:23:04,541
Call 911!

1220
01:23:29,035 --> 01:23:29,869
Hey.

1221
01:23:31,971 --> 01:23:32,805
How's she doing?

1222
01:23:35,007 --> 01:23:36,008
She's been in and out.

1223
01:23:37,810 --> 01:23:40,911
You look tired, you
should go home and rest.

1224
01:23:40,913 --> 01:23:41,912
No, I need to be here.

1225
01:23:41,914 --> 01:23:44,048
No, you should rest.

1226
01:23:44,050 --> 01:23:45,950
If she wakes up and
you look like this,

1227
01:23:45,952 --> 01:23:47,787
I'm not gonna hear
the end of it.

1228
01:23:51,023 --> 01:23:51,656
All right.

1229
01:23:52,992 --> 01:23:55,893
Fine, I will go home and shower.

1230
01:23:55,895 --> 01:23:57,864
Okay.

1231
01:23:58,765 --> 01:23:59,596
You good?

1232
01:23:59,598 --> 01:24:04,336
Yeah, I got it.

1233
01:24:41,941 --> 01:24:42,973
Oh.

1234
01:24:42,975 --> 01:24:44,043
You have a nice nap?

1235
01:24:46,012 --> 01:24:48,879
Could you ring for a nurse
and get us some dinner?

1236
01:24:48,881 --> 01:24:50,713
God, what time is it?

1237
01:24:50,715 --> 01:24:51,884
It's time for dinner.

1238
01:24:53,685 --> 01:24:55,820
Katharyn, do you
know where you are?

1239
01:24:55,822 --> 01:24:56,756
In the hospital.

1240
01:24:57,722 --> 01:24:58,989
Do you know why?

1241
01:24:58,991 --> 01:25:00,026
Yeah, I...

1242
01:25:00,993 --> 01:25:02,026
Jessee?

1243
01:25:02,028 --> 01:25:04,028
Jessee's okay.

1244
01:25:04,030 --> 01:25:04,897
Let me call Luke.

1245
01:25:07,967 --> 01:25:08,801
No.

1246
01:25:12,071 --> 01:25:13,338
Gimme a minute.

1247
01:25:15,007 --> 01:25:16,441
Is my purse here?

1248
01:25:30,056 --> 01:25:31,924
The first time I met
Luke's grandmother,

1249
01:25:33,059 --> 01:25:35,458
I was scared out of my wits.

1250
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:36,896
She was a formidable woman

1251
01:25:38,197 --> 01:25:40,465
and she carried
herself so strong.

1252
01:25:42,434 --> 01:25:45,668
Luke's father and his
family were ranch owners

1253
01:25:45,670 --> 01:25:48,540
and I was the girl from the
other side of the tracks,

1254
01:25:50,009 --> 01:25:53,012
and I started dating their
son when we were both 19.

1255
01:25:55,114 --> 01:25:58,017
Got engaged when we were 20 and,

1256
01:25:59,819 --> 01:26:01,354
married when we were 21.

1257
01:26:05,858 --> 01:26:08,625
Do you know why
pearls are so special?

1258
01:26:08,627 --> 01:26:11,496
Why they're different
from other gems?

1259
01:26:12,631 --> 01:26:13,964
No.

1260
01:26:13,966 --> 01:26:16,532
Well, they come from
the sea, not the earth.

1261
01:26:16,534 --> 01:26:18,905
They don't have to
be cut or polished.

1262
01:26:19,972 --> 01:26:20,773
They're born.

1263
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:26,711
And when they're born, they
come out strong and beautiful.

1264
01:26:28,546 --> 01:26:29,980
That's what my
mother-in-law told me

1265
01:26:29,982 --> 01:26:31,583
that night before I got married.

1266
01:26:34,486 --> 01:26:36,122
When she gave me this ring.

1267
01:26:41,559 --> 01:26:42,962
It's like you, Sage.

1268
01:26:44,596 --> 01:26:49,501
You are strong, and
beautiful, and unique,

1269
01:26:50,269 --> 01:26:50,903
and I want you to have it.

1270
01:26:51,871 --> 01:26:53,837
I can't accept this.

1271
01:26:53,839 --> 01:26:55,139
I'm not the one you
wanna give this to.

1272
01:26:55,141 --> 01:26:57,009
Yes, you are.

1273
01:26:58,244 --> 01:27:00,210
You are, dear.

1274
01:27:00,212 --> 01:27:01,213
It's just...

1275
01:27:03,816 --> 01:27:04,716
You don't know me.

1276
01:27:06,651 --> 01:27:07,485
Sage.

1277
01:27:15,861 --> 01:27:17,763
Hey, you, where you off to?

1278
01:27:19,198 --> 01:27:22,066
Hi, I have to go,
Luke, okay, your mum...

1279
01:27:22,068 --> 01:27:24,669
Hey, what'd she say now?

1280
01:27:26,604 --> 01:27:28,473
This isn't how
it's supposed to go.

1281
01:27:29,241 --> 01:27:31,308
How what was?

1282
01:27:31,310 --> 01:27:33,946
This was meant to
be a job, just a job.

1283
01:27:34,981 --> 01:27:36,248
What are you talking about?

1284
01:27:37,883 --> 01:27:39,615
I love you.

1285
01:27:39,617 --> 01:27:40,918
I love you too.

1286
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:43,655
No, no, Luke,

1287
01:27:47,293 --> 01:27:49,128
I am in love with you.

1288
01:27:59,205 --> 01:28:00,871
Hey.

1289
01:28:02,975 --> 01:28:04,010
Luke,

1290
01:28:05,011 --> 01:28:06,576
say it.

1291
01:28:07,980 --> 01:28:09,547
I am so in love with you.

1292
01:28:58,097 --> 01:28:58,931
Hey.

1293
01:29:01,666 --> 01:29:02,933
Well...

1294
01:29:02,935 --> 01:29:04,667
There's
some scary one.

1295
01:29:04,669 --> 01:29:07,204
Do you wanna meet
your little brother?

1296
01:29:07,206 --> 01:29:08,573
Okay, come on.

1297
01:29:31,063 --> 01:29:32,731
Hello, Baby Blake.

1298
01:29:35,101 --> 01:29:39,136
Aww!

1299
01:29:46,045 --> 01:29:47,313
I'm glad you hired her, too.
