1
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:00,828
Doctor!

2
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:03,197
I need you in here!

3
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:15,609
Doctor, I need you to see this.

4
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:17,911
God dammit.
What? What is it?

5
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:21,115
There's been an incident.
I neede your help.

6
00:01:21,115 --> 00:01:23,016
Get Mr. Warren.
He'll take care of it.

7
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,119
But Doctor--

8
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,088
I'm in the middle
of a surgery, nurse.

9
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,790
I'll get there as soon as I can.

10
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,324
Yes, Doctor.

11
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:36,430
Where was I?

12
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:47,275
That's him.

13
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:48,409
Come on.

14
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:50,811
Come on!

15
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,770
Stop making things difficult.

16
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,912
Let me go!

17
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:26,480
Get me out of here!

18
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,581
Let me
go. Let me out of here.

19
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:33,254
Scream all you want.

20
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:34,888
No one can hear you.

21
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,828
Kids.

22
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:43,731
Let me out of here!

23
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:02,650
Zula.

24
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:37,618
Are we there yet?

25
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:42,723
Yeah, Megan, we're here.

26
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:49,897
Smart ass.

27
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:43,577
Where is everyone?

28
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:45,646
Shouldn't they be here by now?

29
00:05:45,646 --> 00:05:47,448
As far as I know.

30
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:48,416
Megan?

31
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,750
Oh, look, there's Dale.

32
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,526
Hey, Dale.

33
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,873
Welcome to Tearlon.

34
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,008
Not bad.

35
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,777
Yeah, they're still in the
process of remodeling,

36
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:17,711
but the whole
interior's brand new.

37
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:33,160
- Hey, Megan.
- Hey.

38
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,028
You get a look around?

39
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,697
Uh, no, still trying
to get to my room.

40
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:40,801
It gets more beautiful
every time I come up here.

41
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:42,870
If you'll excuse me, Rita,

42
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,071
we should probably show
these two to their room.

43
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,679
Our room?

44
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:52,746
Yeah. Come on.

45
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:55,683
Okay.

46
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:01,989
Come on in.

47
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:10,197
So everyone else called dibs.

48
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:11,599
You two are the last ones here.

49
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,900
So you're going
to have to share.

50
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,468
Hope there aren't
any objections.

51
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:16,203
Cute double beds.

52
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:17,037
Yeah. Great.

53
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:20,474
So?

54
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:22,109
I'm okay with it if you are.

55
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:22,876
It works for me.

56
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:30,083
Well, you two are
the only ones not to complain.

57
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:31,785
It seems our little group
has a talent

58
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,621
for finding flaws
in a free trip.

59
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:34,922
Don't worry, Dale.

60
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:36,456
I'm sure we'll
think of something.

61
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,291
All right.

62
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,893
I'll be downstairs
if you need anything.

63
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:40,694
- Thanks, Dale.
- Sure.

64
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,066
Wow.

65
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:47,000
Look at that view.

66
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,146
Oh, shit.

67
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:52,432
- Hey!
- Jesus, Tedi.

68
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:53,300
Jesus? Where?

69
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:57,004
- Did you see him?
- See who?

70
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:58,405
- The kid.
- What kid?

71
00:08:58,405 --> 00:08:59,306
The little kid.

72
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:01,308
What? I didn't see any kid.

73
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:03,543
I saw Joel.

74
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,346
Who the fuck is Joel?

75
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,981
Joel is Lira's special
delivery from her

76
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,182
douche of the month club.

77
00:09:09,182 --> 00:09:10,651
Wait, what?

78
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:12,653
Lira brought some guy.

79
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,321
She brought her boyfriend?

80
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:16,957
Yeah, if you want
to call him that.

81
00:09:16,957 --> 00:09:19,927
But I thought this trip
was just for our department.

82
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:21,729
Yeah, I thought so too, but I
guess she found a loophole.

83
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:23,897
Which was?

84
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:25,966
She just showed up with him.

85
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:28,001
And if I'd known
you could do that,

86
00:09:28,001 --> 00:09:28,969
I would have brought myself a
little something to poke on.

87
00:09:30,704 --> 00:09:32,405
Tedi.

88
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,007
Come on. It could happen.

89
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,743
FYI, you've got to share
a wall with them,

90
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,310
so I hope you weren't planning

91
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,411
on getting any sleep
this weekend.

92
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,379
Are you kidding me?

93
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,848
No.

94
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:42,582
Oh, what's this is
I hear about you

95
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,351
and, uh, Forest sharing a room?

96
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:46,186
It's no big deal.

97
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:48,255
It's not like we're in
the same bed or anything.

98
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,790
Yeah, not with that
attitude you're not.

99
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,059
We're just friends.

100
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:55,128
Oh, so then it's cool if
we switch rooms, right?

101
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:56,363
You touch her
and I'll kill you.

102
00:09:58,465 --> 00:09:59,900
Don't move.

103
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,201
She can't see us
if we don't move.

104
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:05,605
Hey, Zac.

105
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,041
What's up, fellas?

106
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:12,379
What was that all about?

107
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:14,748
Shut up, Tedi.

108
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:21,021
Zac, I'll see you at dinner.

109
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:54,988
Who was that?

110
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,690
No one.

111
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:57,257
I can't get a signal.

112
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,660
You know the first
rule of vacationing.

113
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,295
Leave everything behind.

114
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:03,296
I know.

115
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,066
But this isn't a vacation, Zac.

116
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,401
It's a retreat.

117
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:09,102
All right, smart ass.

118
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:14,407
Attention
please..

119
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,408
See?

120
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:16,243
Back to work.

121
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:21,014
Could I get everyone's attention

122
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:21,915
down in the living room, please?

123
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:28,455
You guys seen Tedi?

124
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,725
He's in the bathroom.

125
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:32,726
Probably beating off.

126
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:34,661
Nope.

127
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:36,429
I tugged one out before we left.

128
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:37,497
I am good.

129
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:39,032
All right.

130
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,001
Looks like everyone's here.

131
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:42,302
I just wanted to
let you guys know

132
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,237
you need to be
extra careful, okay?

133
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,139
Especially if you wander
out in the woods at night.

134
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,007
The caretaker said
there's a lot of bears

135
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:48,742
around this time of year.

136
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:50,443
Wouldn't look really good
on my review if one of you

137
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,612
come back dead or with a
huge bite out of your ass.

138
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:53,781
Don't even think about it.

139
00:11:53,781 --> 00:11:55,048
All right?

140
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,517
Tonight's fair game, guys. Okay.

141
00:11:57,517 --> 00:12:00,087
Have fun, whatever, but let's
not forget why we're up here.

142
00:12:00,087 --> 00:12:01,421
We have our first
meeting tomorrow.

143
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,756
Yeah, why are we here?

144
00:12:03,857 --> 00:12:05,859
Ah, good question.

145
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:08,862
Uh, we're up here because it's
a simultaneous pat on the back

146
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:11,264
and kick in the
pants, to be honest.

147
00:12:11,264 --> 00:12:12,800
The head honchos love
what we're doing, okay?

148
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,301
That's why we're here.

149
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,303
But they're worried that
our shareholders

150
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:18,038
are going to get a little
bit antsy and jump ship

151
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:19,840
if our little growth
stock doesn't somehow

152
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,808
exceed next quarter's forecast.

153
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:22,142
Rita?

154
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:26,479
We'd like to start by
getting everyone together

155
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,781
to help inspire team unity.

156
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,553
Oh, and they want
to pick our brains

157
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:35,989
to see if we can figure out
ways to increase productivity.

158
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,991
Of course, with the same
amount of resources,

159
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,592
which is always nice.

160
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,862
It's only a couple
of meetings, people, okay?

161
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:42,762
You pretty much have
the rest of the weekend

162
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,763
to do whatever you want.

163
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,332
Like get eaten by bears?

164
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:46,399
Rawr.

165
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,735
Fine, if it makes you happy.

166
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,337
Okay?

167
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:52,472
If there aren't any
other smart aleck remarks,

168
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:53,807
does anyone have any
questions or comments?

169
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:54,207
Yeah.

170
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,409
What if we see a ghost?

171
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,547
Meigan, ghosts aren't real.

172
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:01,815
Thank you.

173
00:13:01,815 --> 00:13:02,415
Uh, what about the Holy Ghost?

174
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,218
That's not the same thing.

175
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:08,421
But you believe
in Jesus, right?

176
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:10,423
Of course.

177
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,527
Well, isn't that kind of
like believing in Santa Claus,

178
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:15,428
but not the Easter Bunny?

179
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:20,000
Tedi, you don't
believe in Christ?

180
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:25,005
Um, no, but I do believe
in the Antichrist.

181
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:29,276
How come?

182
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,679
Because she works in marketing.

183
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:34,948
Okay.

184
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,149
Knock it off. Knock it off.

185
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,650
Let's not start a holy war.

186
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,451
See what you started?

187
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:42,289
At some point during the
weekend I expect

188
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:44,324
each of to thank Rita,
for talking to Penny Pinchers

189
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,193
into even letting
us come up here.

190
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:47,727
Thank you so much, Rita.

191
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:48,461
Thank you, Rita.

192
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:50,697
Yeah, thanks, Rita.

193
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:51,231
You're the best.

194
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,268
Meigan, if I could
offer a piece of advice?

195
00:13:56,603 --> 00:13:57,704
Shoot.

196
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:59,539
Don't worry about dead.

197
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,241
Fear the living,
especially with this group.

198
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,843
All righty.

199
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:04,477
I'll bear that in mind.

200
00:14:08,015 --> 00:14:09,082
Hey, Dale, can I
talk to you for a sec?

201
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:11,885
Sure, Zach. What's up?

202
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:15,989
Who was that old man with Rita?

203
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:17,257
That was Earl Ray,
the caretaker.

204
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:18,892
He greeted us when we got here.

205
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:21,128
Is he staying here?

206
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:22,262
No, he said he has a
cabin nearby somewhere.

207
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:24,631
Really?

208
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:26,166
Yeah.

209
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,067
Only living soul
around for miles.

210
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:31,538
Okay, thanks.

211
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:32,472
No problem.

212
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:33,907
Good meeting.

213
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:41,548
Ugh.

214
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:43,483
Nature sucks.

215
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,518
Oh, come on.

216
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:46,319
I kind of like it here.

217
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:50,490
I'm probablly going to get,
like, a million mosquito bites.

218
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:52,092
Can you blame them?

219
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:59,299
What the hell are we going to do
up here for three days?

220
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:03,536
Well, there's a hot
tub on the porch.

221
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:07,640
Um, you trying to
get me into a bikini?

222
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,108
No,

223
00:15:10,277 --> 00:15:11,344
trying to get you out of one.

224
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:15,915
The blue one or the black?

225
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,022
Hmm, I don't know.

226
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:22,555
I'm going to have
to see them on.

227
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:25,325
Alright.

228
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:11,371
Well?

229
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:15,608
I don't know. Turn around.

230
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,747
It's kind of revealing,
don't you think?

231
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:21,614
That's the point.

232
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:23,583
Don't worry I have a wrap

233
00:16:25,218 --> 00:16:26,419
to keep Tedi from
checking out my ass.

234
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:29,889
Let me see the other one.

235
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,624
Are you serious?

236
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:32,592
Yeah, I'm dead serious.

237
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:35,595
Fine.

238
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:15,268
Happy?

239
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,471
And then some.

240
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,550
Mm, what do you
think you're doing?

241
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,285
You wanted to go in the hot tub.

242
00:17:32,285 --> 00:17:33,786
Changed my mind.

243
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:34,821
Too bad.

244
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,156
I'm ready.

245
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:37,290
Put your fucking suit on.

246
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:39,292
All right, already.

247
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,108
See you later.

248
00:18:14,194 --> 00:18:15,061
Oh.

249
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,297
What's up, player?

250
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:18,298
Good morning.

251
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,334
I thought iTunes was
against your religion.

252
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:22,735
No.

253
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:25,438
The lord loves music.

254
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,439
Oh.

255
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,474
So what do you got on that?

256
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:28,541
Like, Motorhead or?

257
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:31,211
Book of Psalms.

258
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:33,846
Oh, seriously?

259
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:34,747
Um-hum.

260
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:38,351
I find it very inspiring
when I go for a nature hike.

261
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:41,954
All right then.

262
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,156
Carry on.

263
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:44,791
Peace be with you, Tedi.

264
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:45,558
You too, kiddo.

265
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:55,768
What's up, dude?

266
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:57,370
Morning.

267
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:00,373
Looks like someone got
some ass last night.

268
00:19:01,908 --> 00:19:03,876
That's kind of a personal
matter, don't you think?

269
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:04,611
Not if you have ears, it's not.

270
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:11,184
Hey, you ever play that
game ass, cooter, mouth?

271
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:13,520
Ass, cooter, mouth,
uh, no.

272
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,722
I can't say that I have.
How do you play?

273
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:18,525
Well, you give me a
number one through three,

274
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:20,159
and I try and guess which hole
you stuck it in last night.

275
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:22,795
What if I say all three?

276
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:25,398
What if I say high five?

277
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:27,367
Smack.

278
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,803
Not necessarily in
that order though.

279
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:31,604
You're all right, man.

280
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:34,241
You're a fucking douchebag.

281
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:34,774
Heard that.

282
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:36,609
Good morning, Lira.

283
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:39,612
I said, good morning, Lira.

284
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,181
Good morning, Tedi.

285
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:44,951
Hey, you know that expression,
'That girl's got spunk'?

286
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:47,420
Yeah.

287
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:50,323
Well, when they
say it about you

288
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:50,823
I think they mean
it quite literally.

289
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,063
It's called toothpaste, dipshit.

290
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:58,130
You should try it.

291
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,699
Yeah, I will.

292
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,601
I do that after
I have my coffee.

293
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:03,403
That way I get that clean
mouth feeling all day.

294
00:20:05,472 --> 00:20:06,406
Do you know where they
keep the toothpicks?

295
00:20:06,973 --> 00:20:08,140
Yeah.

296
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,609
Joel's got one between his legs.

297
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:11,278
Right?

298
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:12,445
Hey, buddy.

299
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:13,546
Can I kill him, Dale,

300
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,947
please?

301
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:15,982
Not unless you find
me a new programmer.

302
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:19,986
Tedi's kind of like that
fat guy in Jurassic Park.

303
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:20,853
We loose him and all
hell breaks loose.

304
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:23,256
Yeah.

305
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:25,057
If it wasn't for me, you'd
be up to your dick sucker

306
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,293
in dinosaurs.

307
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:29,362
Let me know if you
change your mind.

308
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:31,130
I'm making omelettes.

309
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:31,664
Who wants one?

310
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:33,266
No thanks.

311
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,234
Oh, God, Dale. No.

312
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:38,438
What's wrong with my omelettes.

313
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:38,971
They're made with love.

314
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:42,909
Whoa.

315
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:45,412
What happened to you?

316
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:52,251
What?

317
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:55,422
What?

318
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,994
Psalm 23,
the Lord is my shepherd,

319
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:02,462
I shall not want.

320
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,666
He makes me to lie
down in green pastures.

321
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:09,502
He leads me beside
the still waters.

322
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,305
He restoreth my soul.

323
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:16,876
He leads me in paths of righteousness for his namesake.

324
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:22,582
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

325
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:25,051
I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

326
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,288
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

327
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:35,528
Thou preparest a table for me in the presence of mine enemies.

328
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:36,529
Thou anointest my
head with oil.

329
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:38,731
My cup runeth over.

330
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:42,869
Surely goodness and
mercy shall follow

331
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:43,736
me all the days of my life.

332
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,341
And I shall dwell in the
house of the Lord forever.

333
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:58,351
All right. Who's missing?

334
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:00,520
Not me.

335
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:01,954
Anybody seen Rita?

336
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:03,690
Uh, yeah.

337
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,458
She went for a jog this morning.

338
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,826
Did she say where
she was going?

339
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,160
Fuck if I know.

340
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,129
She probably went to
find Jesus or something.

341
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:10,963
Should we wait for her?

342
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:13,433
Uh, no.

343
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:14,801
We've covered most
of this already.

344
00:22:14,801 --> 00:22:15,468
I'll just fill her in
when she gets back.

345
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:16,703
Yeah.

346
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:17,770
Let's get this
party started, huh?

347
00:22:19,071 --> 00:22:19,972
Let's get down to business.

348
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:23,710
I'd like to start off
by saying thank you

349
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,478
to all of you for the
past quarter's extra work.

350
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:26,846
I really appreciate
all your effort.

351
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:27,947
You're welcome.

352
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:29,549
Okay.

353
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:30,883
My design team, you're
going to be happy to know,

354
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:31,784
your prayers are
finally being answered.

355
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:34,220
You're transferring Tedi?

356
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:39,992
Oh, Forest, you break my heart.

357
00:22:39,992 --> 00:22:43,763
Oh, we still love you,
Tedi, just from far away.

358
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:46,399
Like a fine work of art.

359
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:49,402
Yeah, something like that.

360
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,707
I'm upgrading your
workstations with the new iMacs.

361
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,443
Retina display, flash
drives, the whole deal.

362
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:58,411
Yes.

363
00:22:58,411 --> 00:22:59,979
I thought you'd like that.

364
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:01,914
What about storage?

365
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:04,216
Um, I'll have to look
into it, but storage is cheap.

366
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,017
It shouldn't be a problem
getting it authorized.

367
00:23:06,653 --> 00:23:08,988
Hey, uh, what about
loosening up Websense?

368
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:10,457
I mean, it's not like I
can't hack through that shit

369
00:23:10,457 --> 00:23:11,591
if I wanted to.

370
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:13,125
You know I could.

371
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,227
I just-- why waste
my time, you know?

372
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,763
You only want them
to take down Websense,

373
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:17,630
so you can look at porn.

374
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:21,734
Whoa, it is not my fault the
server crashes every time

375
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,035
I try and download
your sex tape.

376
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:24,837
You're going to die.

377
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:27,039
Lira.

378
00:23:31,678 --> 00:23:34,647
Children, could you
come back to the table?

379
00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:56,102
All of a sudden came the thunder
of hooves rushing up the path.

380
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,772
A dark figure in
a black cloak

381
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,073
rode it's horse
toward the porch.

382
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:04,711
The old man walked
down the front stairs.

383
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,481
And the cloaked figure stopped
his horse just outside

384
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:10,449
the pool of light
that was being cast

385
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,818
by the lanterns
hung above the porch.

386
00:24:15,421 --> 00:24:18,190
The old man staggered back.

387
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,660
Shot twice, once in the neck
and the other in his chest.

388
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:24,864
The dark figure rose
up onto his horse

389
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:27,867
and fled down the lane
disappearing into the night.

390
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:31,771
Friends rushed to
the old man's aid,

391
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:33,239
but it was already too late.

392
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:38,410
The first shot had bored
a quarter sized hole.

393
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,512
Now's your chance.

394
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:40,847
To a chamber--

395
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:42,582
What the hell are
you talking about?

396
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:44,116
Chicks get super turned
on when they're scared.

397
00:24:45,852 --> 00:24:47,119
Like you would know.

398
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,055
Trust me.

399
00:24:49,055 --> 00:24:51,524
Both times I scored the chick
was either drunk or scared.

400
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:53,726
I think one of the
times she was both.

401
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,566
Alright.

402
00:24:59,566 --> 00:25:01,067
Hey, hey, Zac?

403
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:02,068
Just in case.

404
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:04,503
Thanks, Tedi.

405
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,437
Do you guys mind?

406
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:07,039
No.

407
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,741
Sorry. It was just getting
really good, Dale.

408
00:25:08,741 --> 00:25:09,942
Please continue.

409
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:11,177
Thanks.

410
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:17,283
Now as I was saying,
so much blood

411
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:20,653
poured from the old man's
wounds that a thick pool

412
00:25:20,653 --> 00:25:21,754
formed underneath his head.

413
00:25:23,556 --> 00:25:24,657
He coughed once.

414
00:25:26,593 --> 00:25:27,760
And then again,

415
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:31,497
The second being
a hideous gurgling

416
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:33,900
sound as though
two invisible hands

417
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,135
were choking the old
man to death,

418
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:39,305
squeezing the very
life out of him.

419
00:25:41,908 --> 00:25:44,143
The sound sent a shiver
up the spines of everyone

420
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:49,215
who heard the old man's
last dying breath.

421
00:25:58,925 --> 00:25:59,558
Hey.

422
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,328
Dale's ghost story
getting to you?

423
00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:03,830
Oh yeah.

424
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,331
I'm going to have
nightmares for weeks.

425
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:06,666
Here.

426
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:07,166
I brought you some Pinot.

427
00:26:08,701 --> 00:26:10,336
Trying to get me liquored up?

428
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:11,503
Maybe.

429
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:12,204
Is it working?

430
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:14,206
Maybe.

431
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,776
This is really good.

432
00:26:16,776 --> 00:26:18,010
Compliments of Mr. Sau.

433
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:22,815
You know, I was a little
taken back by him joining us

434
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:23,349
on our little retreat
here, but, um,

435
00:26:25,151 --> 00:26:26,018
now I'm starting to think it
might have its benefits.

436
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:30,222
Having a rich boyfriend
does have its advantages.

437
00:26:31,691 --> 00:26:32,058
Are you sure?

438
00:26:34,661 --> 00:26:35,795
I wouldn't know.

439
00:26:37,129 --> 00:26:39,498
I'm a 'Two Buck
Chuck' type of girl.

440
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,237
You okay?

441
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:47,707
Yeah.

442
00:26:47,707 --> 00:26:48,240
I'm all right.

443
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:51,410
No.

444
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,044
There's something wrong.

445
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:54,380
I see it in your eyes.

446
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:54,847
Oh.

447
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:57,850
You can read my
eyes now, can you?

448
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:58,384
Yeah. I can.

449
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:01,253
I bet you can't even tell
me what color they are.

450
00:27:03,756 --> 00:27:04,256
Well?

451
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,360
* She's got eyes of
the bluest skies *

452
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,797
* As if they
thought of rain *

453
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,331
**And I'd hate to
look into those eyes *

454
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:14,133
* And see an
ounce of pain *

455
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,935
They are brown.

456
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:17,636
I know. I'm just
messing with you.

457
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,172
And you stole that
from Axl Rose.

458
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:21,741
How do you know he
didn't steal that from me?

459
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:22,909
Because you're
not that sensitive.

460
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:24,711
I am sensitive, dammit.

461
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:27,146
As if Axl Rose is
Mr. Sensitivity.

462
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,916
Hey, I'm sure he's a nice
guy once you get to know him.

463
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:31,483
That's like saying
he's an asshole,

464
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,518
but you'll get to used to it.

465
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:33,986
No it's not.

466
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,088
He once threw a girl
down a flight of stairs.

467
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:38,925
Well, I'm sure he
had good reason to.

468
00:27:38,925 --> 00:27:39,859
Yeah, he did.

469
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:43,295
Because she wouldn't
sleep with him.

470
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:44,296
That will do it.

471
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:46,498
That is not funny.

472
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,734
That is--

473
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:49,235
Why, why are you laughing?

474
00:27:49,235 --> 00:27:50,903
I am not laughing.

475
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:51,704
I see that.

476
00:27:52,571 --> 00:27:53,672
Damn you, Zac.

477
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:57,376
Why do you always have
this messed up way

478
00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:58,277
of making me feel better?

479
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:00,713
I don't know how you do it.

480
00:28:03,716 --> 00:28:04,717
Are you going to tell me
what's wrong?

481
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:08,454
Rita's not back yet.

482
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:10,456
Are you sure?

483
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:14,894
I thought she was just avoiding Dale's tale of the occult in there.

484
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:17,529
I'm pretty sure, Zac.

485
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,697
She's been gone all day.

486
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:22,068
Have you told Dale?

487
00:28:22,068 --> 00:28:22,334
No.

488
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:25,137
I didn't want to spoil his fun.

489
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:27,106
A whole hell of a lot of fun.

490
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:31,343
Should we go back in?

491
00:28:32,745 --> 00:28:33,345
If we have to.

492
00:28:41,788 --> 00:28:43,322
From that day on the servants
couldn't keep the porch clean.

493
00:28:45,925 --> 00:28:48,494
Every few weeks a
damp pool of blood

494
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:51,330
would appear in the same spot
where the old man had died.

495
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:55,534
They tried repainting
the porch several times,

496
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:57,736
but the blood stain would
always bleed through.

497
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:02,174
One night one of the
servants saw something

498
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:03,409
that caused him to go mad.

499
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:09,081
Folks said that the
house was haunted

500
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,382
by the angry spirit
of the old man.

501
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,053
The house was sold
several times,

502
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:15,154
but each time the
residents were driven out

503
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:21,727
by the horrible gasping
breaths of the old man's ghost

504
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:23,395
and the hideous blood stain
that could never be removed.

505
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:29,168
The house was eventually
abandoned until just last year.

506
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,204
One year ago today, in fact.

507
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:39,011
When it was completely remodeled
and turned into Tearlon Lodge.

508
00:29:42,548 --> 00:29:43,415
You're so full of it, Dale.

509
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:46,585
I had you going.

510
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:48,888
I don't know. I thought
the story was pretty good.

511
00:29:48,888 --> 00:29:51,790
Up until the end because I
think I heard that one before.

512
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,558
Yeah?

513
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:56,162
Good one, D,
although I think

514
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:57,729
you've got to give
partial credit to Joel.

515
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:59,265
The wine definitely helped.

516
00:29:59,265 --> 00:30:00,199
Yeah, it's something else.

517
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:02,568
You have any more?

518
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:04,303
Yeah.

519
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,637
I got a whole case of it.
I'll go get you some some more.

520
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,405
Let him get it himself.

521
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:08,207
Don't be a bitch, babe.

522
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:10,442
Excuse me?

523
00:30:11,777 --> 00:30:13,745
He said don't be
a bitch, bitch.

524
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:17,516
Did you want any more?

525
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:18,050
- Sure.
- Okay.

526
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:25,024
Dale?

527
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:26,859
Hey.

528
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,328
You missed my finale.

529
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:31,497
I'm sure you didn't disappoint.

530
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:33,032
Yeah, but every
great storyteller

531
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:36,168
saves his best for last.

532
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:39,271
I'm worried about Rita.

533
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:41,707
She hasn't come back yet
and she's been gone all day.

534
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:42,875
Did you try her cell?

535
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:44,576
No, I can't get a signal.

536
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:46,145
Yeah, me either.

537
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:47,646
Has anybody seen Rita?

538
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:48,714
Yeah, I did.

539
00:30:48,714 --> 00:30:50,516
She got eaten by a bear.

540
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:51,884
Tedi.

541
00:30:51,884 --> 00:30:53,419
Can you be serious
for one fucking minute?

542
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:54,553
No.

543
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:58,290
Which one's Rita again?

544
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:01,660
She's a dark hair, skinny
chick, huge bug in her ass.

545
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:02,561
Oh, yeah.

546
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:04,263
I remember her.

547
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:05,898
Yo, money bags,
pass the hammer.

548
00:31:05,898 --> 00:31:08,267
Thank you.

549
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:09,936
I really think we
should look for her.

550
00:31:09,936 --> 00:31:11,270
Wait a second.

551
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:13,305
She comes up here all the time.

552
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:15,107
She might have just gone to
visit with the caretaker.

553
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:17,543
Well, is there any
way we can contact him?

554
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,578
I don't think he
even has a phone.

555
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:20,546
I kind of get the impression he
prefers to live off the grid.

556
00:31:22,448 --> 00:31:23,382
Well, what if Zac and
I go and look for her?

557
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,017
No.

558
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:27,553
I can't have you two traipsing
off in the middle of the night.

559
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:28,887
You could get lost, or
fall in a bear trap,

560
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:32,358
or God knows what else.

561
00:31:32,358 --> 00:31:33,993
If she's not back by the
morning we'll go look for her.

562
00:31:33,993 --> 00:31:35,727
- Okay?
- Alright.

563
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,930
That goes for everybody.

564
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,631
Even Joel?

565
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:43,835
Yes, even Joel.

566
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:45,804
With that, I'm going to
get some sleep.

567
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:47,873
This wine's done a number on me.

568
00:31:47,873 --> 00:31:50,209
I need to hit the hay.

569
00:31:50,209 --> 00:31:52,244
Try to keep it down
to a dull roar.

570
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,512
Good night, Dale.

571
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:54,580
Night, bud.

572
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,447
Goodnight.

573
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:56,748
Night.

574
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:00,152
Good night. I'm glad
you liked the wine.

575
00:32:00,152 --> 00:32:02,654
Well, can I refreshen
your glass, your majesty?

576
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:05,391
Please.

577
00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:06,592
Whoa, that's good.
Thank you.

578
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:08,027
You're welcome.

579
00:32:08,027 --> 00:32:09,928
Here, babe.

580
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,130
Seriously, Joel, enough.

581
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:15,401
You're no good to me
when you're like this.

582
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:16,835
Oh, come on.

583
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:18,570
It's better when you're drunk.

584
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,972
Not for me it's not.

585
00:32:19,972 --> 00:32:21,340
Whoa.

586
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,675
Tough woman to please, huh?

587
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:26,012
Buddy, you ain't kidding.

588
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:28,547
I'm going to my room.

589
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:35,954
Are you coming?

590
00:32:38,257 --> 00:32:40,559
Joel, The heart wants
what the heart wants.

591
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:44,163
Not you, mongoloid.

592
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:45,764
I'll be up in a minute, babe.

593
00:32:45,764 --> 00:32:46,198
Yeah. Fuck you.

594
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,003
I'd get up there if I were you.

595
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:52,371
The longer you wait.

596
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:56,408
The bitchier she gets.

597
00:32:57,743 --> 00:32:59,378
Too much to drink, Tedi boy.

598
00:33:00,612 --> 00:33:01,680
All right.

599
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,215
Well, on that note.

600
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,753
All right. I'll see
you guys later.

601
00:33:07,753 --> 00:33:10,289
Adios, amigos and, uh, feel free
to drink the rest of the wine.

602
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:11,057
- Thank you.
- It's all yours.

603
00:33:11,057 --> 00:33:11,990
Good night.

604
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,060
No. Wait, oh God.

605
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:14,993
I'm going to join you.

606
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:18,430
Oh, oh.

607
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,698
I got you.

608
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:20,466
I got you, big boy.

609
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:21,933
Okay.

610
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,202
There we go.

611
00:33:23,202 --> 00:33:24,503
Up the stairs.

612
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,072
Hey, do you and Lira
have any plans tonight?

613
00:33:26,072 --> 00:33:28,174
Yeah.

614
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:31,410
I'm going to bury my sword so
deep in that stone-cold bitch,

615
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,811
the first person who pulls it
out's going to get declared

616
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:34,046
the King of England.

617
00:33:34,046 --> 00:33:34,613
Brothers.

618
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:38,384
What are you two
jibber jabbering about?

619
00:33:38,384 --> 00:33:40,652
Just, just guy talk.

620
00:33:43,222 --> 00:33:45,257
Got you, buddy. Careful.

621
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:46,992
Someone's going to break
their neck on those things.

622
00:33:46,992 --> 00:33:49,195
Yeah, watch out.

623
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:51,763
Tedi, isn't your
room downstairs?

624
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,199
I thought we were going to tag
team like the Hardy Boys?

625
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:57,035
No three way for you tonight,
bud. Sorry.

626
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,337
I wouldn't be so
sure about that.

627
00:33:58,337 --> 00:33:59,438
He's got two hands.

628
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:02,074
Lira makes a joke.

629
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:03,475
Tops.

630
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,681
All right.

631
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:13,419
Well, about time for
you to be hitting

632
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:14,853
the old dusty trail, right?

633
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:15,954
Yeah. I'm going to go.

634
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:16,488
Good choice.

635
00:34:17,956 --> 00:34:20,492
You, uh, slay that
fire-breathing cocksucker.

636
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,060
Bye.

637
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:24,463
Are you, you okay?

638
00:34:24,463 --> 00:34:24,696
Yeah.

639
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,332
Hey, Zac.

640
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:28,467
Looking good.

641
00:34:42,548 --> 00:34:45,117
I think everyone's going
to get some action tonight.

642
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:46,518
Good night, Tedi.

643
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:48,654
Please.

644
00:34:48,654 --> 00:34:49,655
Good night. Go.

645
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:51,357
Fine.

646
00:34:51,357 --> 00:34:53,325
But long live the
King of Arthur.

647
00:34:55,927 --> 00:35:00,299
Long live the--
long live King Arthur.

648
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,001
Long live the King.

649
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:04,102
He is nuts.

650
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:05,704
Fucking loon.

651
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:13,545
You know you worry too much.

652
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,148
You're probably right.

653
00:35:17,183 --> 00:35:18,750
There's no probably to it.

654
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:19,518
I'm always right.

655
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:21,887
How could I forget?

656
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:23,522
It happens.

657
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:36,668
Um, you gonna come upstairs?

658
00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:37,569
Not yet.

659
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:40,372
I'm going to wait
here for a while.

660
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,175
See if Rita straggles in.

661
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:46,212
All right.

662
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,221
Don't stay up all night.

663
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:56,588
I won't.

664
00:35:58,224 --> 00:35:59,391
Good night, Zac.

665
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:01,593
Good night, Meigan.

666
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:34,393
Rita?

667
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:37,629
Rita?

668
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:43,635
Are you in here?

669
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,203
Rita?

670
00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:14,366
What was that?

671
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:16,001
Shut up, Joel.

672
00:37:16,001 --> 00:37:17,603
Yeah.

673
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:18,904
It was probably nothing.

674
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:03,208
Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!

675
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:04,810
I fucking hate you!

676
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:07,112
Tessa, calm down.

677
00:39:07,112 --> 00:39:10,916
Shut up! Shut
up! Leave me alone!

678
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:11,016
You know
what happens if you don't

679
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:12,451
calm down, right?

680
00:39:12,451 --> 00:39:14,486
We'll have to sedate you.

681
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:15,454
I'm going to kill you!

682
00:39:15,454 --> 00:39:17,589
I'm going to kill you.

683
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:35,340
Hey.

684
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,575
Jeez.

685
00:39:36,575 --> 00:39:38,109
Relax. It's just me.

686
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:39,077
What are you trying to do?

687
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:39,845
Scare me to death?

688
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:41,246
Scare you?

689
00:39:41,246 --> 00:39:43,148
You're the one creeping
around in the fucking attic.

690
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:44,883
I thought Hugo had gotten loose.

691
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,752
I was halfway down
to the bait shop

692
00:39:46,752 --> 00:39:47,953
to pick up a bucket
of fish heads.

693
00:39:47,953 --> 00:39:49,488
Sorry.

694
00:39:49,488 --> 00:39:51,089
Hey, are you going
to come to bed?

695
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:53,124
Think the fuck-a-thon
next door is over,

696
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:54,993
so you and I actually
might get some sleep.

697
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:56,628
Finally, some good news.

698
00:39:58,363 --> 00:39:59,565
What the hell are you
doing in the attic anyway?

699
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:03,635
I don't know.

700
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:06,972
All right, weirdo.

701
00:40:06,972 --> 00:40:07,973
Come on.

702
00:40:07,973 --> 00:40:08,440
Okay.

703
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,656
Kill her.

704
00:40:27,593 --> 00:40:29,661
She lies.

705
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:30,829
Who?

706
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:36,067
Who?

707
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:39,471
Hey.

708
00:40:39,471 --> 00:40:40,071
You all right, Zac?

709
00:40:41,807 --> 00:40:42,073
Yeah.

710
00:40:43,475 --> 00:40:43,875
You sure?

711
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:45,844
Uh huh.

712
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:50,682
Is Meigan in there with you?

713
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:54,486
No.

714
00:40:57,422 --> 00:40:58,490
She's not into you, you know.

715
00:41:00,058 --> 00:41:00,692
Excuse me?

716
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:03,495
I know you've got
this huge crush on her.

717
00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:05,864
It's totally obvious.

718
00:41:07,733 --> 00:41:08,900
But she's not over her ex.

719
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,705
Girls just kind of a sixth
sense about this sort of thing.

720
00:41:15,774 --> 00:41:17,175
You know, I'll bet she
even tried to call him

721
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:17,709
while she was up here.

722
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:22,013
Maybe.

723
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:23,849
I don't know about you,
but that sure as hell

724
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:24,916
would bug the shit out of me.

725
00:41:27,118 --> 00:41:30,121
Being all alone at night
next to the one you ache for.

726
00:41:31,623 --> 00:41:34,492
Being so close, yet so far.

727
00:41:36,662 --> 00:41:38,129
I bet that's got
you all pent up.

728
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:41,800
What are you doing?

729
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,701
What does it look
like I'm doing?

730
00:41:46,605 --> 00:41:47,773
What about your boyfriend?

731
00:41:47,773 --> 00:41:49,775
He's not my boyfriend.

732
00:41:49,775 --> 00:41:50,942
But we can sport fuck at best.

733
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:53,545
You'd still be
cheating on Joel.

734
00:41:55,614 --> 00:41:56,915
You know, I never really
liked the term cheating.

735
00:41:58,449 --> 00:41:59,951
Makes it sound like I'm
playing some sort of game.

736
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:01,987
Aren't you?

737
00:42:02,888 --> 00:42:03,188
What?

738
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:05,757
Playing a game.

739
00:42:09,127 --> 00:42:12,530
If I win the game,
do I get a prize?

740
00:42:16,501 --> 00:42:17,969
Have you seen the Excedrin?

741
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:18,970
Get your fucking
hands off of me!

742
00:42:20,672 --> 00:42:21,973
You okay?

743
00:42:23,408 --> 00:42:23,975
I don't want to talk about it.

744
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:40,558
Meigan, please calm down.

745
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,693
Well, she still
isn't back yet, Dale.

746
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:43,795
It's time someone worry.

747
00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:45,597
Hey, I wasn't
disagreeing with you, okay?

748
00:42:45,597 --> 00:42:46,632
Just don't get all panicky.

749
00:42:46,632 --> 00:42:47,899
We'll find her.

750
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:49,500
It's been 24 hours.

751
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,902
Obviously something's wrong.

752
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,570
Rita never came back?

753
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,739
No.

754
00:42:53,739 --> 00:42:54,706
We have to go look for her.

755
00:42:54,706 --> 00:42:55,540
Where's Tedi?

756
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,942
Tedi?

757
00:42:56,942 --> 00:42:58,209
Tedi?

758
00:42:58,209 --> 00:43:00,045
Stop yelling, Dale.
I'm right here.

759
00:43:00,045 --> 00:43:01,980
Okay. There you are.
Get your shoes on.

760
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,281
You've got to come with me
and find the caretaker.

761
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:04,916
Let's see if maybe
seen Rita around.

762
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,152
I'm in no condition
to go for a hike.

763
00:43:07,152 --> 00:43:09,320
Get your shoes on now or
spend the rest of the trip

764
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,789
prying my foot out of your ass.

765
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:12,891
Aye aye, captain.

766
00:43:12,891 --> 00:43:15,360
Zac, I need you to check
around the lake for me.

767
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,027
You got it, boss.

768
00:43:18,363 --> 00:43:20,298
Lira, I want you to check
the local hiking trails.

769
00:43:20,298 --> 00:43:21,366
There's a map in my room.

770
00:43:21,366 --> 00:43:23,034
You can use that.

771
00:43:23,034 --> 00:43:24,535
You want to go tramping
through the woods?

772
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:25,771
Yes, I do.

773
00:43:25,771 --> 00:43:27,038
And take Joel with you.

774
00:43:27,038 --> 00:43:28,073
You'll cover more
ground that way.

775
00:43:28,073 --> 00:43:28,640
All right.

776
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,041
Fuck.

777
00:43:31,743 --> 00:43:32,844
Bitch.

778
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,648
Meigan, I need you to stay here
just in case she comes back.

779
00:43:36,648 --> 00:43:38,249
I'm not staying here.

780
00:43:38,249 --> 00:43:39,550
I want to help you guys.

781
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,786
I know you do.

782
00:43:40,786 --> 00:43:42,721
That's why I want
you here, okay?

783
00:43:42,721 --> 00:43:45,256
If she's hurt or needs anything,
or something happens to us,

784
00:43:45,256 --> 00:43:47,759
I need someone here
I can count on. Okay?

785
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:48,894
You want me to leave
that to Lira, or Tedi?

786
00:43:50,228 --> 00:43:51,997
Guess not.

787
00:43:51,997 --> 00:43:53,431
And keep your phone on
just in the off chance

788
00:43:53,431 --> 00:43:54,465
you get a signal.

789
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,701
- Okay.
- Okay.

790
00:43:55,701 --> 00:43:56,601
Tedi, let's go.

791
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:57,602
I'm coming.

792
00:43:57,602 --> 00:43:59,270
No, not-- move it, now, buddy.

793
00:44:00,672 --> 00:44:01,039
Good luck.

794
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,348
What?

795
00:44:10,348 --> 00:44:11,082
What was that back there?

796
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:13,484
With what?

797
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:14,686
With that guy, Zac.

798
00:44:15,821 --> 00:44:17,923
Fucking Christ, Joel, not now.

799
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:21,526
Oh, what?

800
00:44:21,526 --> 00:44:22,660
You going to have a conniption
fit or something?

801
00:44:23,729 --> 00:44:24,696
Or something.

802
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:26,965
What's your problem?

803
00:44:26,965 --> 00:44:28,366
What was that back there?

804
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:29,167
We were just talking.

805
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:29,868
Bull shit.

806
00:44:33,038 --> 00:44:34,072
- Joel.
- I saw you.

807
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,610
What are you saying?

808
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:40,278
You know what I'm saying.

809
00:44:47,052 --> 00:44:48,319
He tried to kiss me.

810
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:54,325
He came out onto the porch.

811
00:44:56,061 --> 00:44:57,796
He looked like
something was wrong.

812
00:44:57,796 --> 00:44:58,930
So I went over to
see if he was okay.

813
00:45:00,665 --> 00:45:02,633
And one thing led to another.

814
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:03,902
I guess he took that as me
coming onto him or something.

815
00:45:08,073 --> 00:45:09,140
And it's not the first
time it's happened either.

816
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:13,178
He does this all
the time at work.

817
00:45:13,178 --> 00:45:13,945
It's disgusting.

818
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:18,784
Why don't you tell Dale?

819
00:45:18,784 --> 00:45:19,951
I did the first
time it happened.

820
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:22,954
It's just my word against his.

821
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,691
And Dale likes him.

822
00:45:26,691 --> 00:45:28,159
Everybody in the office does.

823
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:29,961
Including you?

824
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:35,366
What the hell kind of a
person do you think I am?

825
00:45:35,366 --> 00:45:38,069
There's something seriously
wrong with that guy.

826
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,371
He's on all kinds of medication.

827
00:45:40,371 --> 00:45:41,139
He literally scares me.

828
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:46,978
I just didn't want to because
any trouble or anything.

829
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:52,784
Don't you trust me?

830
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:57,755
I don't feel safe around him.

831
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:00,291
Hey, I'm sorry. Okay?

832
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:01,626
No.

833
00:46:01,626 --> 00:46:02,360
Don't touch me.

834
00:46:07,132 --> 00:46:09,467
Why don't you be a man
and do something about it

835
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:11,169
instead of tearing me down
with your bullshit accusations?

836
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:23,982
Rita?

837
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:26,885
Ricola?

838
00:46:26,885 --> 00:46:27,819
Bad joke, Tedi.

839
00:46:30,588 --> 00:46:31,756
Rita?

840
00:46:31,756 --> 00:46:32,223
Rita?

841
00:46:34,759 --> 00:46:35,793
Jesus?

842
00:46:38,997 --> 00:46:39,998
Worth a shot, right?

843
00:46:46,037 --> 00:46:47,238
You looking for birds?

844
00:46:48,173 --> 00:46:48,439
Bingo.

845
00:46:49,774 --> 00:46:50,441
Come on.

846
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,646
Hey, I'm hungry, Dale.

847
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:56,414
Yeah. We'll eat later.

848
00:47:04,622 --> 00:47:06,457
Should probably knock first.

849
00:47:06,457 --> 00:47:07,058
Why? The door's open.

850
00:47:10,929 --> 00:47:11,429
Anybody home?

851
00:47:13,865 --> 00:47:14,599
Earl Ray?

852
00:47:16,034 --> 00:47:17,035
I don't think he's home.

853
00:47:20,705 --> 00:47:22,340
Door's locked.

854
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,474
Why would the door be
locked if no one was here?

855
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:26,577
Rita?

856
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:27,078
You in there?

857
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:28,880
Rita?

858
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:32,017
If anybody's in
there, can you open up?

859
00:47:32,017 --> 00:47:33,084
We're missing one of our group.

860
00:47:33,084 --> 00:47:34,152
We need help.

861
00:47:34,152 --> 00:47:35,120
She can't hear us.

862
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,321
I'm breaking it down.

863
00:47:36,321 --> 00:47:38,223
Easy, Tedi. This
isn't our house.

864
00:47:38,223 --> 00:47:39,857
You can't just go breaking
people's doors down.

865
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,559
She's probably
bound and gagged.

866
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:43,194
There's blood and shit
all over the place.

867
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:44,262
We can't just
leave her in there.

868
00:47:44,262 --> 00:47:45,096
We don't even know she's here.

869
00:47:48,934 --> 00:47:50,068
Rita?

870
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:51,069
Quit fucking around.

871
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:55,974
Just find this Earl Ray guy.

872
00:47:55,974 --> 00:47:56,474
It's probably just a
big misunderstanding.

873
00:49:28,866 --> 00:49:31,702
"Investigators baffled by
brutal crime at a private

874
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:34,605
psychiatric hospital in the
mountains near Tearlon Lake

00:49:34,605 --> 00:49:38,076
A female patient age nine, whose
name cannot be disclosed

of the same age.

878
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,015
According to the police report

879
00:49:44,015 --> 00:49:46,484
most of the girl's tongue
had been cut out

880
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:48,519

surgical scissors.

who had been working as an
orderly at the Tearlon Lake

Psychiatric Hospital
was brought in

884

for questioning after
investigators discovered

885
00:49:57,862 --> 00:50:00,198
shocking evidence of torture,
deprivation, and child abuse.

"Earl Ray Warren was
released from police custody

yesterday after the conclusion
of the month-long investigation.

892
00:50:27,492 --> 00:50:29,860
Authorities could not produce
any evidence of wrongdoing,

893
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,364
although Warren, age 46,
admitted to many bizarre

894
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:35,900
and cruel methods of negative
reinforcement in the care

895
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,735
and treatment of children,

896
00:50:37,735 --> 00:50:41,005
including a chamber
known only as the box,

897
00:50:41,005 --> 00:50:43,808
a tiny metal cell where children
were placed in isolation

sometimes for days at a time.

899
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,780
It was done only on the direct orders of the trained medical staff."

900
00:51:23,714 --> 00:51:25,716
So what'd you do today?

901
00:51:25,716 --> 00:51:26,517
Colored.

902
00:51:27,785 --> 00:51:29,287
Is this what you drew?

903
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:31,189
You drew this?

904
00:51:31,189 --> 00:51:31,722
Yes.

905
00:51:34,692 --> 00:51:36,294
It's very good.

906
00:51:36,294 --> 00:51:37,895
Thank you.

907
00:51:37,895 --> 00:51:38,696
Is this your family?

908
00:51:40,064 --> 00:51:40,731
Yeah.

909
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,202
Why are they on the ground?

910
00:51:44,202 --> 00:51:44,702
They're dead.

911
00:51:47,438 --> 00:51:48,539
How did they die?

912
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:50,875
I don't know.

913
00:51:52,577 --> 00:51:53,711
Are you lying to me, Ned?

914
00:51:55,012 --> 00:51:56,347
I never lie.

915
00:51:56,347 --> 00:51:58,115
Then how did they die?

916
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,049
God punished them.

917
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:00,218
Why?

918
00:52:00,218 --> 00:52:01,519
He hates liars.

919
00:52:06,991 --> 00:52:08,159
Did you color anything else?

920
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:10,628
No.

921
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:12,530
The other kids came in, so
we went back to our room.

922
00:52:13,498 --> 00:52:15,166
So you weren't coloring alone.

923
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:17,735
I'm never alone.

924
00:52:17,735 --> 00:52:19,270
Who was with you?

925
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:20,538
The one the others
are afraid of.

926
00:52:22,273 --> 00:52:23,408
Does he have a name?

927
00:52:24,742 --> 00:52:25,210
I can't tell you.

928
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:26,277
Why?

929
00:52:26,277 --> 00:52:27,378
He'll hurt me.

930
00:52:29,113 --> 00:52:30,381
Like he hurt Sarah?

931
00:52:31,249 --> 00:52:31,916
Not like that.

932
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:33,751
I don't know what he'll do.

933
00:52:36,954 --> 00:52:39,156
Did you see Sarah today?

934
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:41,426
Yeah.

935
00:52:41,426 --> 00:52:42,827
She came into my room.

936
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:43,394
What for?

937
00:52:45,263 --> 00:52:46,564
To wish me a happy birthday.

938
00:52:48,466 --> 00:52:49,900
I didn't realize it
was your birthday.

939
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:50,768
Happy birthday, Ned.

940
00:52:52,036 --> 00:52:53,871
Thank you.

941
00:52:53,871 --> 00:52:55,172
Did she say anything else?

942
00:52:56,674 --> 00:52:58,409
She said my mommy was
downstairs with presents

943
00:52:58,409 --> 00:52:59,810
and a birthday cake.

944
00:53:01,078 --> 00:53:02,347
Well, would she say that?

945
00:53:02,347 --> 00:53:03,581
Nobody came to see you today.

946
00:53:04,782 --> 00:53:05,583
She lies.

947
00:53:09,153 --> 00:53:11,088
How long has it been
since you saw your parents?

948
00:53:11,088 --> 00:53:12,423
A long time ago.

949
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:15,393
17 months since--

950
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:16,227
I don't want to
talk about this.

951
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:18,829
Why not?

952
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:20,831
It makes him angry.

953
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:33,578
Dale, I really had a
feeling about that room.

954
00:53:33,578 --> 00:53:35,480
I think we should've gone in.

955
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,414
We need more than a
feeling, Tedi, all right?

956
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,218
Anything?

957
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,553
Nothing. No sign of her.

958
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:43,688
I was hoping she was back here.

959
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:46,891
Did you find the caretaker?

960
00:53:46,891 --> 00:53:48,726
No. We found his cabin,
but nobody was home.

961
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:49,627
It was strange.

962
00:53:51,329 --> 00:53:52,830
Didn't you say his
name was Warren?

963
00:53:52,830 --> 00:53:53,431
Yeah.

964
00:53:54,365 --> 00:53:55,833
Earl Ray Warren?

965
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:56,634
Yeah, why?

966
00:53:58,336 --> 00:54:00,471
- I think you need to see this.
- Later.

967
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:02,773
We just came back to see
if she'd come back here.

968
00:54:02,773 --> 00:54:04,742
With her family connections,
if anything happens to her,

969
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:06,477
I might as well kiss
this job goodbye.

970
00:54:06,477 --> 00:54:07,412
We're going to split up
until we find her.

971
00:54:07,412 --> 00:54:09,079
Or the old man.

972
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,681
Okay. Well, be careful.
It could be dangerous.

973
00:54:10,681 --> 00:54:11,015
You, too.

974
00:54:19,957 --> 00:54:20,925
Fuck.

975
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:22,593
God dammit, Zac.

976
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:23,828
You've got to stop
doing that to me.

977
00:54:23,828 --> 00:54:25,029
Doing what?

978
00:54:25,029 --> 00:54:26,096
Scaring the shit out of me.

979
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,465
You just backed into me.

980
00:54:29,434 --> 00:54:30,768
Any word on Rita?

981
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:32,069
No.

982
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:33,638
I was going to ask
you the same thing.

983
00:54:33,638 --> 00:54:34,705
Where the hell could should be?

984
00:54:36,674 --> 00:54:37,875
I don't know, Zac, but I'm
really starting to worry.

985
00:54:40,645 --> 00:54:42,046
I think the caretaker
might be a child molester.

986
00:54:43,714 --> 00:54:44,482
What?

987
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:49,920
I found this article and
the guy's a sex offender.

988
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,359
Did, did you tell Dale?

989
00:54:54,359 --> 00:54:55,993
No.

990
00:54:55,993 --> 00:54:57,528
I, I tried to, but he's
gone back to keep looking.

991
00:54:59,229 --> 00:55:00,398
That's not even the worst of it.

992
00:55:00,398 --> 00:55:01,231
Look at this.

993
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:09,774
Where did you get this?

994
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:12,910
In the attic.

995
00:55:16,914 --> 00:55:19,316
This place used to be some
kind of mental hospital.

996
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,355
Guess that explains why
they got the place so cheap.

997
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:26,524
It's not funny.

998
00:55:28,025 --> 00:55:30,127
The authorities
shut this place down.

999
00:55:30,127 --> 00:55:31,562
They were torturing children.

1000
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:34,198
Fucking kids, Zac.

1001
00:55:34,198 --> 00:55:35,433
Yeah, I get it.

1002
00:55:35,433 --> 00:55:36,501
Young people.

1003
00:55:36,501 --> 00:55:37,535
I-- it's terrible.

1004
00:55:41,972 --> 00:55:42,607
Are you okay?

1005
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:43,741
No.

1006
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:53,851
I wasn't going to tell you this,
but I've been seeing

1007
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:54,785
some pretty weird
stuff around here myself.

1008
00:55:56,887 --> 00:55:57,788
What?

1009
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,558
Why didn't you tell me?

1010
00:56:02,727 --> 00:56:03,761
I didn't think that
you'd believe me.

1011
00:56:06,096 --> 00:56:07,798
As soon as Rita gets back we're
getting the hell out of here.

1012
00:56:10,835 --> 00:56:13,471
There's something not
right about this place.

1013
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:14,972
Great. I'm going to go back out
and see if I can't find her.

1014
00:56:17,442 --> 00:56:18,576
Be safe.

1015
00:56:19,477 --> 00:56:20,377
I will.

1016
00:56:22,913 --> 00:56:27,985
Here, um, take this just in
case that pervert comes back,

1017
00:56:27,985 --> 00:56:29,219
or wherever.

1018
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,588
I want you to be safe.

1019
00:56:31,456 --> 00:56:32,389
Thanks.

1020
00:56:35,493 --> 00:56:36,594
Please come back in one piece?

1021
00:56:37,361 --> 00:56:37,995
I will.

1022
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:41,398
Please extend me
the same courtesy.

1023
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:42,399
I'll be back.

1024
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:39,857
Jesus.

1025
00:57:41,892 --> 00:57:42,693
Hey, Joel.

1026
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,163
Did they find Rita?

1027
00:57:46,163 --> 00:57:47,264
I'm not looking for Rita.

1028
00:57:47,264 --> 00:57:48,298
What?

1029
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,099
I'm looking for you.

1030
00:57:54,171 --> 00:57:55,673
What the fuck?

1031
00:57:55,673 --> 00:57:56,941
What the hell is your problem?

1032
00:57:56,941 --> 00:57:58,475
You're my fucking problem.

1033
00:58:00,377 --> 00:58:01,712
You stay the fuck away from her.

1034
00:58:04,081 --> 00:58:04,915
I didn't touch her.

1035
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:08,218
She's the one that kissed me.

1036
00:58:08,218 --> 00:58:09,086
You calling my girl a liar?

1037
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:10,888
No, Joel.

1038
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:12,723
I'm not.

1039
00:58:15,292 --> 00:58:15,926
I'm calling her a slut.

1040
00:58:17,562 --> 00:58:18,529
And a liar.

1041
00:58:22,366 --> 00:58:23,500
You fucker.

1042
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:25,269
It's not worth it, man.

1043
00:58:26,303 --> 00:58:26,904
Joel, stop.

1044
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,558
Joel, stop!

1045
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,935
Help! Help!

1046
01:00:12,576 --> 01:00:13,010
Rita?

1047
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:16,613
Mr. Warren?

1048
01:00:18,849 --> 01:00:19,884
Come on, guys.

1049
01:00:19,884 --> 01:00:21,251
I fucking hate hiking.

1050
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:23,020
Rita?

1051
01:00:39,203 --> 01:00:39,870
Rita?

1052
01:00:41,505 --> 01:00:42,039
Mr. Warren?

1053
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,048
Oh, shit.

1054
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:55,085
What the fuck?

1055
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:19,109
You guys?

1056
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:22,913
Hello?

1057
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:26,884
Dale?

1058
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:22,139
Anyone down here?

1059
01:02:31,882 --> 01:02:32,382
Someone there?

1060
01:02:38,255 --> 01:02:38,522
Hello?

1061
01:03:29,073 --> 01:03:30,407
You're in a lot of trouble.

1062
01:03:30,407 --> 01:03:31,876
I didn't
do anything.

1063
01:03:31,876 --> 01:03:33,978
Yes, you did.

1064
01:03:33,978 --> 01:03:35,679
Please don't put
me back in the box.

1065
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:38,082
I didn't do it.

1066
01:03:38,082 --> 01:03:39,917
I tried to stop him,
but he doesn't listen.

1067
01:03:39,917 --> 01:03:41,818
I couldn't make him stop.

1068
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,520
Just tell me what happened.

1069
01:03:48,758 --> 01:03:49,259
Ned?

1070
01:03:52,362 --> 01:03:52,863
Ned?

1071
01:03:54,798 --> 01:03:55,265
No.

1072
01:03:59,203 --> 01:04:00,037
No what?

1073
01:04:01,138 --> 01:04:02,472
Ned's not here right now.

1074
01:04:04,808 --> 01:04:05,442
Then where is he?

1075
01:04:06,877 --> 01:04:08,045
That's not important.

1076
01:04:09,813 --> 01:04:10,480
I see.

1077
01:04:12,649 --> 01:04:15,085
Then can you tell me
what happened to Sarah?

1078
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:17,854
I don't think so.

1079
01:04:19,723 --> 01:04:21,458
Can't or won't?

1080
01:04:31,735 --> 01:04:32,302
What the hell?

1081
01:04:33,337 --> 01:04:34,271
Hey, Maigen?

1082
01:04:55,759 --> 01:04:57,127
Who are you?

1083
01:04:59,429 --> 01:05:00,130
Tell me.

1084
01:05:01,698 --> 01:05:02,967
It's not important.

1085
01:05:02,967 --> 01:05:03,900
Oh, I think it is.

1086
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:06,937
I don't care what you think.

1087
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:10,074
Then may I speak with Ned?

1088
01:05:10,074 --> 01:05:11,675
Is he still here?

1089
01:05:11,675 --> 01:05:13,343
You're speaking with me now.

1090
01:05:23,453 --> 01:05:24,121
Hello?

1091
01:05:26,523 --> 01:05:27,357
Anybody down here?

1092
01:05:28,792 --> 01:05:30,027
Okay.

1093
01:05:30,027 --> 01:05:32,963
So tell me what happened.

1094
01:05:34,564 --> 01:05:36,033
You know what happened.

1095
01:05:36,033 --> 01:05:37,601
But do you?

1096
01:05:37,601 --> 01:05:39,136
Of course I do.

1097
01:05:40,837 --> 01:05:43,607
So it was you.

1098
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:44,674
Who else could it be?

1099
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:45,976
Ned?

1100
01:05:45,976 --> 01:05:46,977
Ned wouldn't hurt a fly.

1101
01:05:48,045 --> 01:05:49,346
He's too much of a sissy.

1102
01:05:50,347 --> 01:05:51,381
Is somebody down here?

1103
01:05:57,921 --> 01:05:58,955
Rita, is that you?

1104
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,691
You took something from her.

1105
01:06:01,691 --> 01:06:02,926
Uh huh.

1106
01:06:02,926 --> 01:06:04,028
What did you take?

1107
01:06:04,028 --> 01:06:05,729
You know what it was.

1108
01:06:08,198 --> 01:06:09,399
Why would you do that?

1109
01:06:10,934 --> 01:06:12,402
Liars must be punished.

1110
01:06:19,409 --> 01:06:19,976
What do you do with it?

1111
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:21,145
Rita?

1112
01:06:21,145 --> 01:06:21,945
With what?

1113
01:06:21,945 --> 01:06:23,047
Rita?

1114
01:06:24,648 --> 01:06:25,849
Her tongue.

1115
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:56,946
Oh God. Up you go.

1116
01:06:56,946 --> 01:06:58,115
Come on.

1117
01:06:58,115 --> 01:06:59,249
What the fuck?

1118
01:07:00,917 --> 01:07:01,451
Come on.

1119
01:07:02,952 --> 01:07:03,487
Come on.

1120
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,458
What the hell happened to her?

1121
01:07:09,726 --> 01:07:10,227
Come on.

1122
01:07:18,068 --> 01:07:19,269
Dude, she needs help.

1123
01:07:19,269 --> 01:07:21,037
Yeah, no shit, Zac.

1124
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:22,472
She's going to fucking
bleed to death.

1125
01:07:22,472 --> 01:07:24,808
Well, um, I'll start a fire.

1126
01:07:24,808 --> 01:07:26,176
What?

1127
01:07:26,176 --> 01:07:28,712
You heat metal,
cauterize the wound.

1128
01:07:28,712 --> 01:07:30,180
We don't have
time for that shit.

1129
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:31,715
Well, I'm not a
fucking doctor, Zac.

1130
01:07:31,715 --> 01:07:33,483
Where's Dale?

1131
01:07:33,483 --> 01:07:35,051
I don't know. He's probably
still looking for Rita.

1132
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:35,819
Fuck.

1133
01:07:37,521 --> 01:07:41,491
Um, speaking
of Rita, I found her.

1134
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:43,527
Where?

1135
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:46,296
In the basement.

1136
01:07:47,731 --> 01:07:48,698
She's dead.

1137
01:07:49,633 --> 01:07:51,000
Dead?

1138
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:51,735
Are you sure?

1139
01:07:53,603 --> 01:07:54,704
Are you sure?

1140
01:07:54,704 --> 01:07:56,506
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

1141
01:07:56,506 --> 01:07:58,442
Fuck, she's getting
blood all over the place.

1142
01:07:58,442 --> 01:08:00,410
Just go and find Dale and
I'll stay here with her.

1143
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:03,079
I don't know where Dale is. I--

1144
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,448
Just fucking go find him! Go!

1145
01:08:04,448 --> 01:08:04,848
Fine!

1146
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:07,717
Come on.

1147
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:17,227
What did you do with it?

1148
01:08:17,227 --> 01:08:19,396
With what?

1149
01:08:19,396 --> 01:08:20,997
Her tongue.

1150
01:08:20,997 --> 01:08:23,433
It's in the box.

1151
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:24,601
Nurses
already looked in there.

1152
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:26,035
Not that box.

1153
01:08:26,035 --> 01:08:27,537
My box.

1154
01:08:29,473 --> 01:08:29,639
Music box.

1155
01:08:58,868 --> 01:08:59,303
Shit.

1156
01:09:03,407 --> 01:09:04,474
Where's Tedi?

1157
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:05,942
How the hell should I know?

1158
01:09:05,942 --> 01:09:07,177
He just went out
looking for you.

1159
01:09:07,177 --> 01:09:07,544
What happened to her?

1160
01:09:11,581 --> 01:09:12,549
What?

1161
01:09:12,549 --> 01:09:14,418
We got to get her to a hospital.

1162
01:09:14,418 --> 01:09:15,252
I'm on it. I'm on it.

1163
01:09:15,252 --> 01:09:16,220
Fuck.

1164
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:17,153
Give her to me.

1165
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:18,355
Where's everyone else?

1166
01:09:18,355 --> 01:09:19,256
They went out looking for Rita.

1167
01:09:19,256 --> 01:09:20,424
Fuck.

1168
01:09:21,758 --> 01:09:23,793
Dale, there's something
I got to tell you.

1169
01:09:23,793 --> 01:09:24,361
If I don't leave right now,
she's going to fucking

1170
01:09:24,361 --> 01:09:25,329
bleed to death.

1171
01:09:25,329 --> 01:09:26,530
You find everyone else.

1172
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:27,531
You get to a signal.

1173
01:09:27,531 --> 01:09:28,565
And you fucking call me.

1174
01:09:59,729 --> 01:10:00,764
Ned?

1175
01:10:04,734 --> 01:10:06,336
Ned?

1176
01:10:06,336 --> 01:10:10,173
Twinkle, twinkle in their eyes

1177
01:10:10,173 --> 01:10:12,609
cut out tongues
that tell me lies.

1178
01:10:13,843 --> 01:10:14,644
Ned?

1179
01:10:16,112 --> 01:10:17,414
Why do you keep
calling me that?

1180
01:10:17,414 --> 01:10:18,448
That's your name.

1181
01:10:19,849 --> 01:10:20,650
Everyone calls you Ned.

1182
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:22,819
I hate that name.

1183
01:10:25,021 --> 01:10:26,423
You're the one Ned warned
me about, aren't you?

1184
01:10:28,091 --> 01:10:28,992
The one he tried to stop?

1185
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:31,995
Ned can't stop me.

1186
01:10:33,763 --> 01:10:35,865
But he does know
what you did to Sarah.

1187
01:10:37,434 --> 01:10:38,635
Everyone knows that.

1188
01:10:40,804 --> 01:10:42,105
And he's afraid of you.

1189
01:10:42,105 --> 01:10:43,273
They're all afraid of me.

1190
01:10:45,575 --> 01:10:46,676
So why don't you
tell me who you are?

1191
01:10:48,345 --> 01:10:49,479
Or at least who
you think you are?

1192
01:10:50,847 --> 01:10:52,616
Why do you want to know?

1193
01:10:52,616 --> 01:10:54,117
It's my job to
know what's going on

1194
01:10:54,117 --> 01:10:55,719
inside that head of yours.

1195
01:10:55,719 --> 01:10:56,686
I guess you could
call it curiosity.

1196
01:10:58,355 --> 01:11:00,657
Ask the cat what
curiosity can do.

1197
01:12:16,065 --> 01:12:16,733
Hello?

1198
01:12:17,434 --> 01:12:18,568
Anybody?

1199
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:20,770
Hey, Zac?

1200
01:12:25,041 --> 01:12:25,775
Zac?

1201
01:12:26,776 --> 01:12:27,577
Hey, Zac?

1202
01:12:46,830 --> 01:12:47,030
Tedi!

1203
01:12:50,099 --> 01:12:50,567
You.

1204
01:12:52,469 --> 01:12:53,403
Where is she?

1205
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:56,139
Who?

1206
01:12:56,139 --> 01:12:57,373
Don't play games with me, boy.

1207
01:12:58,442 --> 01:12:59,008
She's got to be here.

1208
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:03,279
Are you talking about Rita?

1209
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:04,013
Where is she?

1210
01:13:06,049 --> 01:13:06,816
She's here.

1211
01:13:09,453 --> 01:13:10,454
Is she okay?

1212
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:11,588
No.

1213
01:13:13,022 --> 01:13:13,923
She's not.

1214
01:13:13,923 --> 01:13:14,624
Son of a bitch.

1215
01:13:15,992 --> 01:13:16,793
I know who you are.

1216
01:13:18,361 --> 01:13:19,596
I know what you do.

1217
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:22,799
You just stay back.

1218
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,501
Stay back!

1219
01:13:28,705 --> 01:13:31,174
Tell me, grandpa, did she
scream when you fucked her?

1220
01:13:33,209 --> 01:13:34,043
I never touched her.

1221
01:13:35,579 --> 01:13:36,613
Pretty little thing like that?

1222
01:13:37,614 --> 01:13:39,115
I'm sure you wanted to.

1223
01:13:39,115 --> 01:13:39,849
Never touched her.

1224
01:13:56,733 --> 01:13:58,067
Is it because you loved her?

1225
01:13:59,736 --> 01:14:01,070
Or because she wasn't a boy?

1226
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:03,206
How dare you.

1227
01:14:06,042 --> 01:14:06,676
Zac?

1228
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:29,599
What do you think
about that, huh?

1229
01:14:29,599 --> 01:14:31,200
How you like it,
you son of a bitch.

1230
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,468
Huh?

1231
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:33,236
See how you like it.

1232
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:47,717
Are you okay?

1233
01:14:53,557 --> 01:14:54,558
I'm sure glad
I gave you that knife.

1234
01:14:56,593 --> 01:14:57,561
Can you stand?

1235
01:14:59,028 --> 01:14:59,262
Yeah.

1236
01:15:09,606 --> 01:15:10,473
- No, no. Don't look.
- Oh God.

1237
01:15:10,473 --> 01:15:10,940
Don't look.

1238
01:15:18,481 --> 01:15:18,948
Tedi.

1239
01:15:20,717 --> 01:15:21,585
It's okay.

1240
01:15:21,585 --> 01:15:22,151
It's okay.

1241
01:15:29,192 --> 01:15:29,726
Let's get out of here.

1242
01:15:44,107 --> 01:15:45,675
Oh shit.

1243
01:15:45,675 --> 01:15:46,309
What?

1244
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:49,545
I don't have the keys.

1245
01:15:51,214 --> 01:15:53,182
My wallet, clothes,
everything, it's inside.

1246
01:15:56,853 --> 01:15:58,121
I'll go in. I'll be quick.

1247
01:15:58,121 --> 01:15:58,755
Zac.

1248
01:16:02,525 --> 01:16:03,893
Here.

1249
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:05,128
Where the hell
did you get that?

1250
01:16:05,128 --> 01:16:06,362
It doesn't matter. I just
want you to take it.

1251
01:16:06,362 --> 01:16:07,096
I need to know that you're safe.

1252
01:16:07,096 --> 01:16:08,064
No.

1253
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:09,198
A gun, Zac. Please, you take it.

1254
01:16:10,734 --> 01:16:12,101
Just get the keys
and get the fuck out.

1255
01:16:12,101 --> 01:16:13,236
I'll be okay.

1256
01:16:13,236 --> 01:16:13,603
I'll be right back.

1257
01:16:20,777 --> 01:16:22,445
Did you forget something?

1258
01:16:22,445 --> 01:16:24,047
Yeah.

1259
01:16:24,047 --> 01:16:24,347
I did.

1260
01:16:33,156 --> 01:16:34,791
Be careful.

1261
01:16:35,692 --> 01:16:36,960
I will.

1262
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:37,627
I'll be right back.

1263
01:17:18,001 --> 01:17:18,634
Hello?

1264
01:17:22,538 --> 01:17:23,406
Anybody home?

1265
01:17:32,882 --> 01:17:33,883
Rita, wait.

1266
01:17:33,883 --> 01:17:35,318
Is he dead?

1267
01:17:35,318 --> 01:17:36,652
You don't understand.

1268
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:38,621
What don't I understand?

1269
01:17:38,621 --> 01:17:40,056
You don't understand
what he is.

1270
01:17:40,056 --> 01:17:41,290
I don't know my
own grandfather?

1271
01:17:42,458 --> 01:17:43,927
What did you do to him?

1272
01:17:43,927 --> 01:17:45,061
Pap pap, are you okay?

1273
01:17:48,531 --> 01:17:49,298
Stay back!

1274
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:55,438
Maigen, no.

1275
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:57,673
Let go, Rita.

1276
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:07,350
Son of a bitch.

1277
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:43,953
You didn't really think you'd
get away with it, did you?

1278
01:19:10,379 --> 01:19:11,514
Tell me who you are.

1279
01:19:13,016 --> 01:19:14,383
You didn't
say please.

1280
01:19:16,619 --> 01:19:19,188
Perhaps you'd like to
think it over in the box?

1281
01:19:25,929 --> 01:19:26,429
I'm waiting.

1282
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:32,435
Zachary.

1283
01:19:34,170 --> 01:19:35,171
Zachary.

1284
01:19:37,841 --> 01:19:39,008
Come in.

1285
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:42,812
Hi, I believe you
were looking for this.

1286
01:19:43,512 --> 01:19:44,713
Yes.

1287
01:19:44,713 --> 01:19:45,381
Set it on my desk.

1288
01:19:50,386 --> 01:19:51,988
Take the patient
back to his room.

1289
01:19:53,589 --> 01:19:54,223
Yes, sir.

1290
01:19:56,225 --> 01:19:58,427
And see to it he doesn't
get in any more trouble.

1291
01:19:59,662 --> 01:20:00,229
Understand?

1292
01:20:01,998 --> 01:20:02,565
You can count on me.

1293
01:20:32,862 --> 01:20:33,829
You don't have to do that.

1294
01:20:35,364 --> 01:20:36,032
If you didn't
want my help, Ned,

1295
01:20:37,733 --> 01:20:39,035
you shouldn't have asked for it.

1296
01:20:40,937 --> 01:20:42,071
He's still alive, you know.

1297
01:20:43,539 --> 01:20:44,307
Not for long.

1298
01:20:52,949 --> 01:20:54,617
Such a naughty little boy.

1299
01:20:59,622 --> 01:21:01,124
And you know what
happens to naughty

1300
01:21:01,124 --> 01:21:02,491
little boys here, right?

1301
01:21:04,293 --> 01:21:05,061
Yeah.

1302
01:21:06,395 --> 01:21:08,264
I'll see you again real soon.

1303
01:21:09,966 --> 01:21:11,067
And you better not scream.

1304
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:16,505
You don't want to get in
trouble again, do you?

1305
01:21:34,390 --> 01:21:36,092
Such a good boy.

1306
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:52,108
Stop being so difficult.

1307
01:22:02,151 --> 01:22:03,152
Scream all you want.

1308
01:22:05,321 --> 01:22:05,688
Nobody will hear you.

1309
01:22:08,691 --> 01:22:09,492
No!

1310
01:22:09,492 --> 01:22:10,593
Oh God!

1311
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:21,370
Son of a bitch.

1312
01:22:42,725 --> 01:22:44,060
Dale?

1313
01:22:44,060 --> 01:22:45,995
Zac, I'm at the hospital.

1314
01:22:47,330 --> 01:22:48,831
Yeah, Lira's going to make it.

1315
01:22:48,831 --> 01:22:50,099
She's getting a transfusion now.

1316
01:22:50,099 --> 01:22:51,267
But she lost a lot of blood.

1317
01:22:51,267 --> 01:22:53,602
But she got lucky.

1318
01:22:53,602 --> 01:22:55,171
Believe me, I, I know.

1319
01:22:55,171 --> 01:22:57,173
They're at the hospital.

1320
01:22:57,173 --> 01:22:58,174
Lira, she's going to make it.

1321
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:00,209
Is that Maigen with you?

1322
01:23:01,144 --> 01:23:02,045
Yeah, it is.

1323
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,047
Hey, Dale.

1324
01:23:05,014 --> 01:23:05,648
Who else is with you?

1325
01:23:06,682 --> 01:23:07,183
It's just us.

1326
01:23:10,619 --> 01:23:11,220
What do you mean?

1327
01:23:12,188 --> 01:23:15,058
I mean it's just us.

1328
01:23:16,725 --> 01:23:18,827
There isn't anybody else.

1329
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:19,428
Please tell
me you're joking.

1330
01:23:20,396 --> 01:23:22,331
He's not joking, Dale.

1331
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:23,366
We wouldn't even
have got out ourselves

1332
01:23:23,366 --> 01:23:24,400
if it wasn't for Maigen.

1333
01:23:25,668 --> 01:23:26,435
God.

1334
01:23:28,271 --> 01:23:29,205
Do you want us to
come to the hospital?

1335
01:23:32,541 --> 01:23:33,442
Dale?

1336
01:23:33,442 --> 01:23:34,277
No.

1337
01:23:34,277 --> 01:23:35,411
Uh, get your butts home.

1338
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:38,147
I should check on Lira.

1339
01:23:38,147 --> 01:23:39,048
Hey, wait.

1340
01:23:40,883 --> 01:23:43,619
By any chance did Lira
say who did this to her?

1341
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:45,421
No.

1342
01:23:45,421 --> 01:23:47,223
She, uh, she said it was dark.

1343
01:23:47,223 --> 01:23:47,690
She didn't really
remember anything,

1344
01:23:49,225 --> 01:23:50,459
It was the old man.

1345
01:23:51,694 --> 01:23:52,261
Mr. Warren.

1346
01:23:54,930 --> 01:23:55,864
All right.

1347
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:57,233
All right.

1348
01:23:57,233 --> 01:23:59,302
Uh, just let me
take care of things.

1349
01:23:59,302 --> 01:24:01,036
You get some rest.

1350
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:02,538
I'll call the police and get
this whole thing squared away.

1351
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:03,572
Okay, Dale.

1352
01:24:03,572 --> 01:24:04,640
You take care.

1353
01:24:05,741 --> 01:24:06,275
You too, Zac.

1354
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:42,711
You brought that
awful thing with you?

1355
01:24:46,315 --> 01:24:47,350
Yeah, I did.

1356
01:24:48,184 --> 01:24:49,185
Why?

1357
01:24:49,952 --> 01:24:51,420
I don't know.

1358
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:52,555
Used to have one as a kid.

1359
01:24:54,190 --> 01:24:56,125
I guess you can call it
me being sentimental.

1360
01:24:58,093 --> 01:24:59,128
Oh my God.

1361
01:25:01,264 --> 01:25:02,331
Oh my God.

1362
01:25:03,866 --> 01:25:04,600
What?

1363
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,168
Zac.

1364
01:25:05,901 --> 01:25:06,735
What?

1365
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:09,638
Rita's still out there.

1366
01:25:09,638 --> 01:25:10,739
We can't just leave her there.

1367
01:25:14,243 --> 01:25:18,547
Maigen, um, Tedi found Rita.

1368
01:25:22,084 --> 01:25:23,152
Well, where is she then?

1369
01:25:27,256 --> 01:25:28,157
Where is she?

1370
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:38,234
Dale!

1371
01:25:40,203 --> 01:25:41,537
Is anybody here?

1372
01:25:42,905 --> 01:25:43,906
Shh.

1373
01:25:48,877 --> 01:25:52,781
I guess you can say that
she's in a better place.

1374
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:31,153
I don't know what
I would've done

1375
01:26:31,153 --> 01:26:31,820
if you hadn't been there today.

1376
01:31:08,864 --> 01:31:10,699
Don't stick your
tongue out at me.
