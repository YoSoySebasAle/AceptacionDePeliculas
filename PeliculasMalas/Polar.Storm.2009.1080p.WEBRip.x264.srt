1
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,400
Hello,

2
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,760
this is Lou Vinetti
reporting live from KJRX.

3
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,160
I don't know if anybody
out there can hear me or not.

4
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,480
Only hours remain before Earth's
magnetic field declines to zero,

5
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,360
and as most of
you know by now,

6
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,160
once that occurs

7
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,320
solar radiation will destroy
the atmosphere.

8
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,160
And God be with us all.

9
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,840
Turn the car off.

10
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,200
I think it's gone.

11
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,880
Start the car.

12
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,920
Dammit.

13
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,960
We'll have to go back.

14
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,480
Get out of the car now!

15
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,480
Come on! Jump!

16
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,720
Ahhh!

17
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,360
No!

18
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,840
Flights across the globe
have been grounded for 24 hours

19
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,400
as the comet
Copernicus passes Earth,

20
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,080
which will be the largest
celestial object

21
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,960
in recorded history
to pass this close.

22
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,080
It is expected to create

23
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,400
a global
electromagnetic disturbance.

24
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,520
When the comet was first
discovered six months ago...

25
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,400
Good morning.

26
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,520
Hey, Miss Penny.

27
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,640
Hey, Cyn.

28
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,520
Zoe, that's Cynthia's order
in the fridge over there.

29
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Okay.

30
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,160
So I'm taking the science club

31
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,040
on a field trip to watch
the comet.

32
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,360
I heard.

33
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,800
That's very brave of you.

34
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,680
You're coming along
too, right, Zoe?

35
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,720
Yep.

36
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,920
Dad is letting me off work
early so I can come, right, dad?

37
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,200
I suppose.

38
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,360
Next up to discuss what
unforeseen dangers

39
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,960
we might be facing we are
joined now via satellite

40
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,360
by our own
Dr. James Mayfield.

41
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,840
Hey, look who's on TV.

42
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,240
Now, doctor, can you
explain why you believe

43
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,400
it's possible that
the comet could hit us

44
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,280
when almost everyone else
has predicted

45
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,400
that it will pass us by.

46
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,000
Wait a minute,
Lou, all I said was

47
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,800
that you can't
you rule it out.

48
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,280
Having just passed the sun,
gasses in the comet's icy core

49
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,120
will be heating
up like a hot spring.

50
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,880
It will affect the comet's
speed and trajectory

51
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,400
in ways that we just
can't predict.

52
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,480
Fascinating.

53
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,280
Now I understand the storm's
hazard department

54
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,080
has sent you to Northern
Alaska to observe

55
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,800
the comet's swing-by.

56
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,800
That's right.

57
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,040
We'll be just inside
the Arctic Circle where

58
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,120
the comet is expected to pass
over its orbital fulcrum,

59
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,080
meaning the closest
it will be to Earth.

60
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,160
It's a very exciting opportunity
for us to observe

61
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,520
geomagnetic anomalies
in the Earth's magnetic field.

62
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,680
Thank you, doctor.

63
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,960
That was local hero and astrophysicist,
Dr. James Mayfield,

64
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,680
via satellite from Alaska.

65
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,360
Getting a signal?

66
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,280
Yep.

67
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,160
Logging in
to the satellite.

68
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,120
Last two Cubans.

69
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,400
I'm saving them for
a special occasion.

70
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,240
That's against
the law you know.

71
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,840
Yeah well relax, Peter,
we're in Alaska.

72
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,400
The U.S. Trade Embargo
says no American citizen

73
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,600
can smoke a Cuban cigar
anywhere in the world.

74
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,120
Alright, we're in.

75
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,080
Show time.

76
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,400
You could get ten years.

77
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,120
Good point.

78
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,920
I better smoke
both of them.

79
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,400
Hey, Pam,
satellite link is up.

80
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,440
You should be getting
our EM readings.

81
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,400
Copy, James.

82
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,400
Reading it now.

83
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,480
Across the globe eyes are
looking skyward tonight.

84
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,640
Millions of teacher and
students in every nation

85
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,080
get the chance to glimpse

86
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,200
something the great
astronomers of the past

87
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,160
could only dream of.

88
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,400
Okay, everyone,
I'd like to show you something.

89
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,640
Just as our planet
has a magnetic field

90
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,200
so does the comet.

91
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,080
Geeze.

92
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,320
The comet's going to be
going past Pluto

93
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,600
by the time
this guy finishes.

94
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,920
Zoe, could you come
up here, please?

95
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,400
Hold this up
for me, please.

96
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,160
So we're going to imagine that this
compass is Earth.

97
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,480
As the comet passes
the magnetic fields interact

98
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,800
creating intense bursts
of electromagnetic waves

99
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,640
which can interfere
with modern technology,

100
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,320
so, ladies, no sulking if your
boyfriend doesn't return

101
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,480
your text
messages tonight.

102
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,680
Yo, it's a freaking comet,
not your mother undressing.

103
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,600
Hey, move it.

104
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,840
Leave him alone.

105
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,000
Hey!

106
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,800
Hey!

107
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,000
Hey!

108
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,240
Stop it!

109
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,400
Stop it!

110
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,960
Stop.

111
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,520
Stop it!

112
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,960
You're both going to be
reimbursing the school

113
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,000
for the cost
of a new telescope.

114
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,400
This guy started it,
Miss Penny.

115
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,320
No, I didn't.

116
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,000
He was picking on him.

117
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,640
It's Mrs. Mayfield now and
I don't particularly care

118
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,480
who started it.

119
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,400
You're both paying
for a new telescope.

120
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,120
I'll be contacting your parents about the exact cost.

121
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,320
It's bad enough you
married my father,

122
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,240
now I can't even get
fair treatment in class.

123
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,480
Go wait by the wait by
the washroom, Shane.

124
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,400
The data is looking
a bit fragmented.

125
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,040
The electromagnetic interference
is coming on strong.

126
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,200
Yeah.

127
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,600
Our friend Copernicus
seems unusually magnetic.

128
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,880
Where's my lighter?

129
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,000
Viewers are probably experiences
increased interference

130
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,160
as Copernicus reaches
what is expected to be

131
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,200
its closest
proximity to Earth.

132
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,080
Comet is at orbital fulcrum.

133
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,160
It should be passing over your
area in just a few minutes.

134
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:38,880
We just got word that the comet
has reached orbital fulcrum.

135
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,080
This is extraordinary.

136
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,040
We will continue
to broadcast...

137
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,400
We may lose our signal.

138
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,360
We apologize for that.

139
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,880
An electromagnetic
storm from the comet

140
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,680
is affecting our electricity.

141
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,400
Whoa! Whoa!

142
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,120
We just had a surge in
the electron acceleration.

143
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,800
The fields EM levels
are skyrocketing.

144
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,720
The radiation belt is being
pushed in to the atmosphere.

145
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,880
Pam, are you reading this?

146
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,880
Yes.

147
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,680
I'm measuring a radiation
spike in the belt's safe zone.

148
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,080
4.5 million
angstroms and rising.

149
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,320
Wait, that's odd.

150
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,800
I'm getting a second
set of separate readings

151
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,320
from the comet.

152
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,440
Magnify sector LP4.

153
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,800
I see something
in the tail.

154
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,200
Copernicus is fragmenting.

155
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,240
A piece of the comet
is breaking away.

156
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,400
We can't see anything.

157
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,240
Can you read
the fragment specs?

158
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,320
Projectile diameter
is 300 meters.

159
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,400
Velocity of 30
kilometres a second.

160
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,360
What's the trajectory?

161
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,280
Descending at...

162
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,840
45 degrees.

163
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,760
It's going to hit Earth.

164
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,200
Use the belt's electron
trajectory to triangulate

165
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,880
a point of impact.

166
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,480
Working on it.

167
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,160
Latitude 51.

168
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,880
Longitude 179.

169
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,240
James, that's only 100 miles
from where you are.

170
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,960
James, did you hear
what I said?!

171
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,840
Get out of there!

172
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,320
Notify IEW
to issue an alert.

173
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,400
Repeat, notify IEW
to issue an alert.

174
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,400
Pam, do you copy?

175
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,560
Dammit!

176
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,400
Where is the projected
point of impact?

177
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,440
I don't know.

178
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,960
I lost her.

179
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,920
Maybe I can
amplify the signal.

180
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,760
Shockwave!

181
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,240
Get back in the car!

182
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,520
What's the point?!

183
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,320
We're dead!

184
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,720
We can't outrun
this blast!

185
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,160
Avalanche bunker
at the bottom of the hill.

186
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,640
What?

187
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,400
Step on it, man!

188
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,280
Try and put in the data
in case we don't make it.

189
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,680
James.

190
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,400
Peter, get out of there!

191
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,400
Come on!

192
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,920
Reports of massive damage
and casualties have been

193
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,120
coming in from Alaska.

194
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,360
Northern Canada and
Eastern Russia.

195
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,720
Communication is still
down throughout

196
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,400
these affected areas.

197
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,280
As the death toll rises
we're getting estimates

198
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,680
the as many as a quarter million
people may have perished

199
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,440
in this history-making disaster.

200
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,320
One piece of
good news to report:

201
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,360
local resident
Dr. James Mayfield

202
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,920
has miraculously
survived the blast

203
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,280
despite being within a few
hundred miles of ground zero

204
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,800
when the comet struck.

205
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,840
He is expected to be
arriving home today.

206
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,520
James.

207
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,560
I thought I lost you.

208
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,320
It's good to be home.

209
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,920
Hey, buddy.

210
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,280
Hey, dad.

211
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,400
You okay?

212
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,520
Yeah.

213
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,680
Welcome home.

214
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,240
Thanks.

215
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,400
Who wants coffee?

216
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,040
I would love one.

217
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,840
Well, uh, I'm sure you guys
have lots of science stuff

218
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,480
to talk about.

219
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,320
Shane, I just got home.

220
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,120
Sit down with us.

221
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,880
I'm kind of tired.

222
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,960
I feel like laying down.

223
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,560
He got into a fight
and broke a telescope.

224
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,920
I'm making him and the other
kid pay for it.

225
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,040
Sorry.

226
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,840
No, no.

227
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,560
Don't be sorry.

228
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,640
I don't envy
either one of you.

229
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,400
I wouldn't want
a step-mother for a teacher

230
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,800
or a step-son
for a student.

231
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,160
Yeah, well now that
you're home

232
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,200
you're going to have to do
all the disciplining,

233
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:11,280
otherwise he's never going
to let me get close.

234
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,840
Deal.

235
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,400
Of all the different
scenarios that could happen

236
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,320
if a comet hit Earth,
I wonder Mr. President,

237
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,400
does the impact
of the comet create

238
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,400
any lasting effects the public
should be concerned with?

239
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,800
We're still investigating
that possibility,

240
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,920
but right now it doesn't appear that there's anything

241
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,760
the public needs
to be worried about.

242
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,400
You've gotta be joking.

243
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,680
What?

244
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,400
A 300 metre projectile hits the planet at 30 kilometres per second

245
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,440
and he's saying there's
nothing to worry about.

246
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,600
Maybe he just doesn't want
to scare the public...

247
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,480
unlike some people I know.

248
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,720
My science advisors
have reported

249
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,920
that the immediate
crisis is over,

250
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,400
so the important thing for
the American people to know

251
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,120
is that they are safe

252
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,920
and they can go on about
their daily lives.

253
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,480
This is unbelievable.

254
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:12,840
James, I know you went through a terrible ordeal in Alaska,

255
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,120
but you're home now,
so let somebody else

256
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,280
do the worrying
for a change.

257
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,920
Enjoy being with
your family.

258
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,400
You're right.

259
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,200
You're right as usual.

260
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,000
The United States of
America stands...

261
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,640
What is that
terrible sound?

262
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,200
Is it an earthquake?

263
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,680
Take cover.

264
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,480
Shane, you okay?

265
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,240
Yeah.

266
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,240
What?

267
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,040
What?

268
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,080
What do you mean
it's been classified?

269
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,400
Just what I said.

270
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,000
All the data
we collected in Alaska

271
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,760
and uploaded to the government
has been classified

272
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,760
and neither you nor I have
the clearance to access it.

273
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,840
In fact, we shouldn't
even be talking

274
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,800
about this right now.

275
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,400
The whole department
is under a gag order.

276
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,960
The tremor we just had

277
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,320
was preceded
by some kind of

278
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,040
EM disturbance which could mean
there's been serious damage

279
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,800
to the magnetic field.

280
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,400
Yeah, I recorded an
electromagnetic spike earlier

281
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,120
but I didn't know
what caused it.

282
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,920
We need the comet data.

283
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,640
Who classified it?

284
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,640
The administration.

285
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,480
Great.

286
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:33,280
Not even a comet hit is
immune to public spin.

287
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,400
Well maybe there really
was some damage to the field

288
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,000
and they don't want
to disclose it to the public.

289
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,400
We need to find out.

290
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,400
You've reached the office

291
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,240
of the President's
science advisors.

292
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,120
Due to
extenuating circumstances

293
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,920
this office will not be taking
calls until further notice.

294
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,360
What are you doing
up on the roof?

295
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,040
Tracking the sun.

296
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,400
And why would you be
tracking the sun?

297
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,200
It's not where it's
supposed to be.

298
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,080
Why would you say that?

299
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,080
Yesterday the sun set
behind Eagle Peak.

300
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:42,760
What do you mean?

301
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,640
It's never set
behind the peak.

302
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Exactly.

303
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,800
Hello?

304
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,640
Hey, is this Shane?

305
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,080
Yeah, who's this?

306
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,640
It's Zoe.

307
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,800
I was just calling
to tell Miss Penny

308
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,400
that the pastries are ready.

309
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,480
Pastries?

310
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,680
Yeah, we're donating them for
the school's disaster fund drive

311
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,400
so she can pick them
up whenever she wants.

312
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,640
Okay, yeah, I'll
let her know.

313
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,400
Okay, bye.

314
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,680
Bye.

315
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,040
Zoe just called.

316
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,560
The pastries for
the fund drive are ready.

317
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,680
You want me to go
pick them up for you?

318
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,400
That would be
great, Shane.

319
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,240
Thank you.

320
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:48,480
Can I help you?

321
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,760
How's it going?

322
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,400
Good.

323
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,680
You're here to pick up the stuff
for your mom, right?

324
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,880
She's not my mom.

325
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,840
Okay.

326
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,480
Step-mom.

327
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,280
You have my sympathy.

328
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,320
I'd die if my dad married
one of my teachers.

329
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,320
Hello?

330
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,800
Hey.

331
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,760
My God.

332
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,400
What is it?

333
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,520
The sun is ten degrees off
where it should be

334
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,280
this time of year.

335
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,240
How could that be?

336
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,320
Okay, in like an hour?

337
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,800
You still meeting Kevin
at the park today?

338
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,440
Uh, yeah.

339
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,800
Okay, bye.

340
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,360
Here it is.

341
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,400
Thanks.

342
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,400
I'll be at the park
with Kevin.

343
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,080
Oh yeah?

344
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,280
Yeah.

345
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,480
I'll see you there.

346
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,400
Cool.

347
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,080
Hey, James.

348
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,600
Hey, Lou.

349
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,120
I haven't had a chance to talk
to you since the interview.

350
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,760
So what's this great
story you've got for me?

351
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,840
Remember how we used
to come out here

352
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,720
and watch all
those sunsets?

353
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,880
Maybe that's what you
came out here for.

354
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,920
I came out here for
the babes and the booze.

355
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,280
Do you remember how this
sundial was always

356
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,200
right on the money?

357
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,600
Yeah, I remember.

358
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,680
Hi, Shane.

359
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,760
Hey, Zoe.

360
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,640
What am I, chopped liver?

361
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,560
So Shane, buddy,
I've got a little problem

362
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,840
because of you.

363
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,000
You see this car?

364
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,400
My dad's making me
sell it to pay

365
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,640
for the stupid
telescope you broke.

366
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,640
We broke.

367
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,880
Whatever.

368
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,280
The point is I think we can
settle this little problem.

369
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,600
How's that?

370
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,960
Drag race.

371
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,000
You win me.

372
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,560
You win and I'll pay the $4,000
we owe for the telescope.

373
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,040
I win, you pay.

374
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,400
Come on,
what do you think?

375
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,400
You're not afraid of getting
your ass whipped, are ya?

376
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,920
You wouldn't win.

377
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,640
Ouch.

378
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,160
You hear that?

379
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,480
Greaser boy thinks
he can beat me.

380
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,000
Let's do it.

381
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,680
Dr. Mayfield said his
suspicion was first aroused

382
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,360
when he noticed the sun
setting behind Eagle Peak.

383
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,520
Now I can tell you from my own
experiences growing up here

384
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,080
that the sun has never
set behind Eagle Peak before.

385
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,600
And then there's our
trusty sundial

386
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,680
which has
never been wrong...

387
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,480
until today.

388
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,480
Ready guys?

389
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,400
Get set.

390
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,960
Ahhh!

391
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,440
Ahhh!

392
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,600
Get out!

393
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,240
Get out, James!

394
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,440
James, Get out!

395
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:08,520
You okay?

396
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,400
Yeah, you alright?

397
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,200
I can't believe
what just happened?

398
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,400
Poor Kevin.

399
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,160
Oh my God.

400
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,720
I can't get a reception,
what about you?

401
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,480
Nothing.

402
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,480
What is that?

403
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,160
It looks like an aurora.

404
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,400
Here?

405
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,520
I thought those things
only happened up north

406
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,240
in places like Alaska.

407
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,480
Something bad is happening.

408
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,000
Dr.
Mayfield, what exactly is the problem with the axis

409
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,760
changing ten degrees?

410
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,840
I mean,
so what if the sun sets ten minutes later.

411
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,440
A shifted axis tilt means
the Earth's axis of rotation

412
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,040
is out of alignment
with its magnetic poles.

413
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,400
This could have
serious consequences

414
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,000
for the Earth's magnetic field.

415
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,680
The seismic activity
and the electromagnetic

416
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,560
interference with communications
that we've been experiencing,

417
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,480
this could all be
just the beginning.

418
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,280
The beginning of what?

419
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,400
A catastrophic
pole reversal.

420
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,480
You mean like what happened a million years ago

421
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,000
when the North and South
Poles change places?

422
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,680
That's right.

423
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,840
Back to you.

424
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,760
Yeah.

425
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,400
Yeah.

426
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,240
Alright.

427
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,400
Alright already.

428
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,120
James, buddy,
we are famous.

429
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,040
What are you
talking about?

430
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,160
You don't know.

431
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,400
Know what?

432
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,400
You're story caught fire.

433
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,160
My report was picked up
by all the big networks.

434
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,640
Really?

435
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,840
There is some weird crap
going on all over this country

436
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,400
that the government
does not want to talk about,

437
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,680
but your theory
makes more sense

438
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,160
than these
alien invasion stories

439
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,520
so the networks
picked it up.

440
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,800
Good.

441
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,160
Maybe it will force the administration to come clean.

442
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,000
Yeah, well, anymore
earth-shattering developments

443
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,080
I'm your man, right?

444
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,200
See you, Lou.

445
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,400
I'm your man, right?

446
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,480
See you, Lou.

447
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,280
I'm your man.

448
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,400
Good morning, gentlemen.

449
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,520
Good morning,
Mr. President.

450
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,600
Good morning,
Mr. President.

451
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,240
How are you, sir?

452
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,480
Who leaked the axis
tilt to the press?

453
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,280
Dr. James Mayfield, sir.

454
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,600
Mayfield?

455
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,400
That's your son
isn't it, General?

456
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,400
Yes, sir.

457
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,680
Dr. Mayfield is my son.

458
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,040
Then what the heck is he doing
leaking classified information.

459
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:55,800
I'm sorry, sir.

460
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,800
I'm not aware of
his activities.

461
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,160
We haven't spoken in
nearly five years.

462
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,960
You don't say.

463
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,760
Well, maybe now would be a good time for a family reunion,

464
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:08,000
because if you don't put
a muzzle on him, we will.

465
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,400
What exactly was his
involvement with this?

466
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,400
Our Storm Hazard Research Department contracted Dr.
Mayfield

467
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,760
to monitor the comet's
effect on the radiation belt.

468
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,960
So wasn't this guy on the same
gag order as everyone else?

469
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,440
Yes, sir, and his research
was classified.

470
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,400
But to be honest, sir,
the data he updated

471
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,840
could not have revealed an axis
tilt as it was collected

472
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,840
prior to the comet hit.

473
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,240
Don't argue semantics
with me, doctor.

474
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,840
A gag order is
a gag order.

475
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,120
I don't need 400 phone calls
coming in to the White House

476
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,520
every hour about a pole reversal that's not going to happen.

477
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,400
It's not going to happen,
right, Dr. Elman?

478
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,760
It's a preposterous
thought, Mr. President.

479
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,280
The consensus is that
the Earth's axis

480
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,880
will slowly fall back
in to place as it rotate.

481
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,560
Glad to hear.

482
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:57,160
However this doomsday hysteria
is exactly why we need

483
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,560
to keep the people in
the dark right now.

484
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,760
Your son?

485
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,560
Sir?

486
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,400
Is he smart?

487
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,400
Yes, sir.

488
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,520
How smart is he?

489
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,400
Too smart for
his own good, sir.

490
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,400
That's what it
sounds like.

491
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,880
You better bring him in.

492
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,320
Yes, sir.

493
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,520
James.

494
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,400
It's really happening.

495
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,640
All the telltale signs.

496
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,400
This is unprecedented.

497
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,400
What is?

498
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,320
The pole reversal.

499
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,640
Shane didn't come
home last night.

500
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,880
Are you sure?

501
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,600
Yeah.

502
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,560
His car's not here,

503
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,560
his bed hasn't
been slept in

504
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,680
and I can't reach
him on his cell.

505
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,240
You said he was going
to the park last night.

506
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,200
Oh my God.

507
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,560
I just heard on the radio
that the park was ripped apart

508
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,680
by a major earthquake
last night.

509
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,520
Let's go.

510
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,280
What's going on?

511
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,000
Dr. Mayfield, we need
you to come with us

512
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,680
to the airbase, sir.

513
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,520
Base?

514
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,480
For what?

515
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,240
I don't know, sir, but we
have an executive order

516
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,040
to take you to the base,
by force if necessary.

517
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,760
I'll find Shane.

518
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,720
I'll call you as soon as
I know what's going on.

519
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,520
This way.

520
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,760
Anything?

521
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,880
Nothing.

522
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,600
This is so weird.

523
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,440
I always get
a signal here.

524
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,400
Hey, dad.

525
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,080
James.

526
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,400
Should have known
you were behind this.

527
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,480
Long time no see.

528
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:18,400
Five years,
not too long.

529
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,240
I guess it
just seemed so to me.

530
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,520
Did you get my
birthday card?

531
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,400
I did.

532
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,320
Thank you.

533
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,960
Very considerate.

534
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,120
How's your son?

535
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,880
He must be getting
awfully big by now.

536
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,960
Yes he is.

537
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,240
You probably wouldn't
even recognize him.

538
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,920
Probably not.

539
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,440
Have a seat, James.

540
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,520
So you've caused quite
a stir in Washington.

541
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,760
How's that, sir?

542
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,280
Violating a government
gag order for one thing.

543
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,440
I didn't violate
any gag order.

544
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,400
That axis shift was
my own research.

545
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,840
Don't play games
with me, James.

546
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,480
You're either on the team
or you're not.

547
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,600
Here we go.

548
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,520
You know full well the intent of a government gag order.

549
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,200
Everything you worked
on was classified.

550
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,320
The public has a right
to that information.

551
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,400
It's not your call, James.

552
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,400
You're a science rat.

553
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,320
You don't make policy.

554
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,640
Scaring the American
public is against

555
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,440
this country's greater good.

556
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,840
You think you're
a good soldier.

557
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,760
You're just a lapdog
for political bosses.

558
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,520
You'd probably shoot me
yourself if they told you

559
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,200
it would serve
the greater good.

560
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,400
What am I doing here?

561
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,280
Obviously it's not
because you miss me.

562
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,800
I had the President of
the United States tell me today

563
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:47,760
that my son was a national
security risk.

564
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,640
So what?

565
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:53,520
He wants to burn me
at the stake?

566
00:34:53,600 --> 00:35:00,080
Lucky for you,
he wants to hear you out.

567
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,360
Oh, you mean he wants
to cover his ass.

568
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,360
Increased electronic
interference continues

569
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,040
to be reported from
around the world.

570
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,880
This new development
coupled with the increase

571
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,680
of reported seismic activity
and the appearance

572
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,400
of what seems to be auroras
around the globe

573
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,200
has many people
figuring for the worst.

574
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,960
Oh my God.

575
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,960
Are you guys okay?

576
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,280
What happened?

577
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,560
Where's your car?

578
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,400
This thin skin is
the Earth's crust.

579
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,960
Spinning liquid in
the core is the engine

580
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,160
which generates our
protective magnetic field.

581
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,800
Dr. Mayfield, we didn't
bring you here

582
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,760
for a geology class.

583
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,320
The shift in the axis tilt
caused slippage

584
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,520
of the crust around
the core.

585
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,760
Consequently the Earth is
now out of alignment

586
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,760
with its magnetic field and
the misaligned crust

587
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,200
is causing increased
seismic activity.

588
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,080
Yes.

589
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,120
We're aware of all that.

590
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,320
We just want to hear
specific evidence

591
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,120
pertaining to your
far-fetched notion

592
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,680
of a pole reversal.

593
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,280
I'm assume you're aware
of beached whales,

594
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,960
birds migrating in the wrong direction,
bees swarming.

595
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:11,680
Yes, yes.

596
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,600
Creatures realigned with
the magnetic field

597
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,160
for navigation were confused,
a short-lived result

598
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,120
of the comet's
temporary distortion

599
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,400
of the magnetic field.

600
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,760
Answer me this then
Dr. Elman:

601
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,320
why are polar auroras

602
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,400
suddenly appearing
in places they shouldn't?

603
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,560
Again, a temporary distortion
of the magnetic field,

604
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,360
similar to what occurs when
there is a bad solar storm.

605
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,400
What are we talking
about here, gentleman?

606
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,600
Aurora Borealis?

607
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,400
Auroras normally occur when the earth's poles attract solar particles.

608
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,440
The fact that so many polar
auroras are appearing elsewhere

609
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,200
indicates that new magnetic
poles are developing.

610
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,280
I saw a polar aurora

611
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,400
here last night.

612
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,680
We are now sitting
on a magnetic pole,

613
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,600
which explains all
the electromagnetic interference

614
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,800
and the seismic activity
we've been having.

615
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,280
Dr. Mayfield, many strange
anomalies have occurred

616
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,400
in modern times without
catastrophic consequences.

617
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:04,120
These fields are
like rubber bands.

618
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,400
They bend
and stretch and thin,

619
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,400
but inevitably they always
return to their original state.

620
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,240
Only this time, Dr.
Elman, the rubber band has snapped.

621
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,440
Mr. President, the mini
poles indicate

622
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,640
a geo-magnetic reversal
has started.

623
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,360
As the North and South
Poles disintegrate

624
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,880
the magnetic field they
support will collapse.

625
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,440
Static discharges will create
electromagnetic shockwaves

626
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,400
which will fry
everything electronic.

627
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,400
We will be thrown back
into the Stone Age.

628
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,280
The North and South Poles
will disappear

629
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,120
remerging at opposite ends
of the globe,

630
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,680
at which point our protective
magnetic shield

631
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,800
will be completely gone,

632
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,040
exposing us to cosmic rays which
will incinerate the planet,

633
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,400
just like what
happened on Mars.

634
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:46,800
Dr. Mayfield, must
we be so melodramatic?

635
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,400
This is real science,
Mr. President.

636
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,160
This planet has seen many
geo-magnetic reversals,

637
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,960
just not since
we've been here.

638
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:01,080
As a man of science I am sure
you can appreciate the need

639
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,920
for thoughtful,
rational discussion;

640
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,400
however, your melodrama and
sensational media appearances

641
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:11,040
gives one the impression that
your intention are perhaps

642
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,280
more to do
with self-promotion.

643
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,560
I've had a long day,
gentlemen.

644
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,000
Signing off.

645
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,880
What did you expect,
James?

646
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,960
You just told them the world
was going to end.

647
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,080
This isn't global
warming, dad,

648
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,840
where we can spend years
dragging our feet

649
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:34,840
and debating the facts.

650
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,480
They'll find out
soon enough.

651
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,840
Wait.

652
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,120
That's the same sound
I heard just before

653
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,880
the quake last night.

654
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,080
Stop the car.

655
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,480
Turn off the car.

656
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,880
My God.

657
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,480
I've never seen
anything like this.

658
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,040
Save your data, everybody!

659
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,320
Storm Hazards.

660
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,400
What just happened?

661
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,920
Oh my god, James.

662
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,400
It was a massive 40
kilohertz EM pulse surge,

663
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,280
unlike anything
we've ever seen.

664
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,680
40 kilohertz?

665
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,640
Yes.

666
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,800
All the cities that were
hit were blacked out,

667
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,640
and not only that,

668
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,000
most of the satellites
in orbit got fried.

669
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,200
What could possibly have
created a surge like that?

670
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,400
It's gotta be connected
to the polar auroras.

671
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,760
Were the hits random?

672
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,720
I don't know yet.

673
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,040
We lost power during the spike,
which was lucky for us,

674
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,400
or else the EM surge
would have fried everything.

675
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,680
We're just getting our
emergency generators going.

676
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,400
We're pulling up data now.

677
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,040
I'm seeing about two dozen
points where 40 mile wide

678
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,360
electromagnetic waves
struck Earth.

679
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,040
Overlay the locations of
the mini poles on your screen

680
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,560
and tell me
what you see.

681
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,680
Overlay the locations
of all detected mini poles.

682
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,080
Oh my God.

683
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,760
All the hit areas are
where the mini poles are.

684
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,400
Then that's it.

685
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,120
The solar particles
attracted by the poles

686
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,400
are building up massive
electrostatic discharges.

687
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,400
Pam, your office has to tell
all those hit areas to evacuate,

688
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,280
including Lindenville.

689
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,040
The discharges are going
to get much stronger

690
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,400
as the field fails.

691
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,960
It's going to be hard
to issue an alert

692
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,400
with a global blackout,

693
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,760
but we'll certainly
do our best.

694
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,800
Can you run a timeline
projection on your mainframe?

695
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:57,480
Give me a couple hours.

696
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,560
It will take a while
to process the data.

697
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,400
James,

698
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,400
how do we stop this?

699
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,840
I don't know that we can.

700
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,120
We just had the first
worldwide blackout in history

701
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,560
and you and none of your brain
trust can explain why?

702
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,080
What we know
right now for certain

703
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,120
are that the affected cities
were struck by large

704
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,320
electromagnetic shockwaves.

705
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,480
Just as Dr. Mayfield
had predicted.

706
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,120
General Mayfield, have you been
able to locate your son yet?

707
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,200
Not yet, sir.

708
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,200
He's in one of
the blackout areas.

709
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,400
Well I want to speak with
him as soon as he's located.

710
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,640
Yes, Mr. President.

711
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,400
So, tell me Dr. Elman,

712
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,040
can you still say
with a certainty

713
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,120
that we're not experiencing
a pole reversal?

714
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,040
I don't have an answer
right now, sir.

715
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,120
Are we going to see
more of this?

716
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,400
Give me the worst
case scenario.

717
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,400
Mr. President, until we've
assembled our teams

718
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,720
I don't want to speculate
on something

719
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,400
that's not my area
of expertise.

720
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,720
Don't try to cover your
ass with me, doctor.

721
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,400
We've got power outages
across the country.

722
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,360
American lives
are at risk.

723
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,160
So tell me,
to the best of your ability,

724
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,320
are we going
to see more of this?

725
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,240
I believe so,
Mr. President.

726
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,800
Then I have no choice

727
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,960
but to declare
Federal Marshall Law.

728
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,000
General Mayfield--

729
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,560
Yes, sir.

730
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,760
--You'll supervise
west coast operations.

731
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,360
Yes, Mr. President.

732
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,760
We'll start setting up
shelters in the affected areas.

733
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:45,640
James.

734
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,640
Thank God.

735
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,480
Did you find Shane?

736
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,160
Yeah, he was at the park.

737
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,240
I've been trying
to call you.

738
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,240
Our cell phones
are useless.

739
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,320
Only the landlines
are working.

740
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,000
Where is he?

741
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:53,960
In the kitchen.

742
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,400
But one of the kids he was
with last night was killed

743
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,520
in the earthquake.

744
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,800
Oh no.

745
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,800
What's going on?

746
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,160
There's no power and I saw
an EM wave in the sky.

747
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,000
It's bad.

748
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,880
We have to get out
of Lindenville.

749
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,000
Shane.

750
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,360
You okay?

751
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,320
What's happening, dad?

752
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,000
Is the world
falling apart?

753
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,720
No, no.

754
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,560
Just going through
a rough patch.

755
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,720
I've packed for us both.

756
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,280
I'm not going with you.

757
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,920
What do you mean?

758
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,920
I'm going back
to the base.

759
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:06,720
What?

760
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,600
What are you
talking about?

761
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,760
Why?

762
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,200
I have an idea and I have
to talk to the President.

763
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,640
I don't want to, Cyn.

764
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:17,320
I just don't see that
there's a choice.

765
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,560
You know what,
you're right.

766
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,120
There is no choice because
your family comes first.

767
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,920
No wonder Shane doesn't
think you love him.

768
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,520
Listen to me.

769
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,720
This is not a drill.

770
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,960
This is the real deal.

771
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,680
The survival of the planet
depends on actions

772
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,920
taken in
the next 24 hours

773
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,480
and those so-called government
science advisors

774
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,040
don't have a clue.

775
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:46,840
I have to do this,
for us.

776
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:52,240
Okay, we're here,

777
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,480
smack in the middle of a mini
pole's magnetic centre,

778
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,520
the most dangerous place
to be right now.

779
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,120
Everywhere inside this circle
is going to get bombarded

780
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,040
with EM pulses and torn apart
by seismic disturbances.

781
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:05,760
I want you guys out of
this circle as soon as possible.

782
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,680
Go to this town here,
Little Brook, and wait for me.

783
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,920
What are you
talking about, dad?

784
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,960
You're coming, right?

785
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,920
I can't.

786
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,720
I have to go back
to the base.

787
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,000
I don't believe it.

788
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,920
You're abandoning us.

789
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:22,920
That sucks.

790
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,200
Shane, try to understand.

791
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,080
There's a global crisis
going on.

792
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,920
You think
I don't know that?

793
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,560
I saw one of my classmates
crushed to death

794
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:30,680
in a car last night.

795
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,640
I know, I know.

796
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,120
I'm sorry.

797
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,880
So you don't care if the
same thing happens to us?

798
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,120
Of course I do.

799
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,280
That's why
I have to fix this.

800
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,160
We'll be okay.

801
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,880
Leave me alone.

802
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,000
Shane, come on.

803
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,280
If an EM wave hits turn
the car off until it passes.

804
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,760
The electronics won't be
short-circuited

805
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,920
as long as
the power is off.

806
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,920
If the power is on,
you and the car will fry.

807
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,560
How long will you be?

808
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,000
A day, maybe two.

809
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,920
Be careful.

810
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,520
Yeah.

811
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,960
You too.

812
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,520
Shane.

813
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,920
No, no, no.

814
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,280
No, no, no.

815
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:30,680
Take those ear buds off.

816
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,680
Stay away from electronics.

817
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:33,800
You will get electrocuted

818
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,040
if an EM wave hits.

819
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,560
I'm serious.

820
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,240
It's dangerous.

821
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,920
Get rid of it.

822
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,840
I'll see you soon.

823
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,080
Hey,

824
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,840
I love you.

825
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,520
Everybody is advised
to stay tuned

826
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,360
to this emergency
broadcast channel.

827
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,000
Federal Marshall Law
has been declared.

828
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,920
Lindenville residents are
ordered to evacuate their homes

829
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,720
and take shelter
at Lindenville Parish.

830
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,240
We repeat...

831
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,880
Why are they telling
everyone to go to the church?

832
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,400
Didn't dad say it was
dangerous to stay in town?

833
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,560
Oh, what's this?

834
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,720
Road's closed.

835
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,840
You're supposed to take
shelter in the parish.

836
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,520
We're going
to Little Brook.

837
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,040
Ma'am, we have orders
to divert everyone

838
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,920
to the Lindenville Parish.

839
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,920
That's ridiculous.

840
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,920
It's not even safe there.

841
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,040
Ma'am, please.

842
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,680
Just back it up, okay?

843
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,040
Let's go.

844
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,520
Come on!

845
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:23,000
Turn the car off.

846
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:45,920
I think it's gone.

847
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,320
Start the car.

848
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,640
Dammit.

849
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,760
We'll have to go back.

850
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:04,920
Get out of the car now!

851
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,040
Come on! Jump!

852
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,120
Ahhh!

853
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,760
No!

854
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,240
Ahh!

855
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:27,320
I can't hold on!

856
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,160
Yes, you can!

857
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,000
Don't let go!

858
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,560
Help!

859
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,040
Anybody! Help!

860
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,640
Grab it.

861
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:45,920
Come on!

862
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,920
We need to evacuate everyone
from the mini pole sites.

863
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:16,840
Evacuate?

864
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:18,800
We just started rounding
up people for the shelters.

865
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:19,520
No, no, no.

866
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,560
You can't do that.

867
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,040
The plasma charges building up
from the pole reversal

868
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,920
are escaping through
the mini poles.

869
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,840
This whole area is going
to get hit worse

870
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,120
and worse
as the field fails.

871
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,560
Alright.

872
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:31,600
I'll notify the soldiers

873
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,960
but communications
have been spotty.

874
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,120
What about the President?

875
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,560
Have you still been
able to contact him?

876
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:36,720
Yeah, the emergency
hotline is holding up.

877
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:37,760
Good.

878
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:40,280
I've got a crazy idea.

879
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,920
I need to access Storm
Hazard's mainframe.

880
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,640
Follow me.

881
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:49,960
Storm Hazards.

882
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,160
Pam, talk to me.

883
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,000
I'm briefing the President
in a few minutes.

884
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,920
James, the computer
projection...

885
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,880
it's not good.

886
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:18,720
I need to see whoever
is in charge.

887
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:27,480
Inside this circle is
the most dangerous place

888
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,720
on the west coast.

889
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,920
We're here,

890
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,320
the epicentre
of the mini pole

891
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,640
creating the electromagnetic
and seismic disturbances.

892
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,920
We need to move all these
people outside

893
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,920
of this circle to here.

894
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,600
Where did you get
this information?

895
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,040
My husband,
Dr. James Mayfield,

896
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,680
he's a government
astrophysicist.

897
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,320
He's briefing the President
right now.

898
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,040
I haven't heard
anything about this.

899
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,640
My orders are
to keep everybody here.

900
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:52,840
I know, but I'm telling
you it's not safe here.

901
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,920
Lindenville has become
the magnetic centre

902
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,560
of a mini pole.

903
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,680
What is that,
a mini pole?

904
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,160
No, no, no.

905
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,080
Turn the power off.

906
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,920
The electricity will
attract the next EM pulse.

907
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,680
You have to shut
the generator down.

908
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:29,920
Shut it down?

909
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I don't think so.

910
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,320
You're not
listening to me.

911
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,960
We're in danger here.

912
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,080
Ma'am, Federal Marshall Law
has been declared.

913
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,920
I can't just move hundreds
of people

914
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,600
because you show me some
map with a circle drawn on it.

915
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:42,640
You know what,
call General Mayfield.

916
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,800
He'll vouch for everything
I've just said.

917
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Storm Hazard's lab
just ran this projection.

918
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,840
This is what the magnetic
field normally looks like.

919
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,840
This is what it looks like now,
punctured by mini poles.

920
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,160
This is 12 hours out,

921
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:10,760
24 hours out,

922
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:12,640
48 hours out.

923
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,720
Magnetic field
at zero gauss.

924
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:15,880
Gentlemen,

925
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:16,600
we have two days

926
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,480
before our planet loses
its protective shield

927
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:22,520
and solar radiation burns
us all to a crisp.

928
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:36,000
Anyone here take issue
with Dr. Mayfield's projections?

929
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,920
No, sir.

930
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,920
No, sir.

931
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,920
Alright then,

932
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,080
so who here has a game plan
to stop this pole reversal?

933
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,120
Alright.

934
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,720
This is the way I see it.

935
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,200
What if we detonate a nuclear
explosion of a magnitude

936
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:54,000
equal to that of which the comet
fragment hit Earth

937
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:56,320
in the opposing hemisphere
so that it pushes back

938
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,840
with equal force?

939
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:58,920
Are you crazy?

940
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,920
How do we know it wouldn't
make things worse?

941
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,320
What about fallout?

942
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,960
Fallout?

943
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,920
The pole reversal
completes in 48 hours

944
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,240
and then
it is bye-bye planet.

945
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,920
Does anybody else
have a better idea?

946
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:19,920
That's what I thought.

947
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,920
That comet fragment hit us with
the force of 100 megaton bomb.

948
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,680
We don't have
a warhead that powerful.

949
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,560
What's the most powerful
nuke in the US arsenal?

950
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,120
We have a new
50 megaton prototype

951
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,880
that's at the nuclear
test site.

952
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,920
Okay, well can formulate
a dual detonation

953
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,000
that will equal 100.

954
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:41,880
And?

955
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:42,920
We can't get through
to the general.

956
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,520
Communication is down.

957
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:45,800
Well we can't just leave
these people here.

958
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,800
This place is a
ticking time bomb.

959
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:50,400
I suggest you find
a cot and you chill.

960
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:55,920
Anything?

961
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,320
Nothing yet, sir.

962
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:00,920
Zoe.

963
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:01,920
Hey.

964
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:02,840
When did you get here?

965
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,920
Just a few minutes ago.

966
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Excuse me, everybody.

967
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:10,760
Can I have your
attention, please?

968
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,920
I'm Cynthia Mayfield, science
teacher at Lindenville High.

969
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,840
Many of you know that
my husband, Dr. James Mayfield,

970
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,200
is a respected astrophysicist.

971
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,040
He's told me that our town
is the epicentre

972
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,800
of the electromagnetic and
seismic disturbances happening

973
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,720
on the west coast
and that it's very dangerous

974
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,680
to stay here.

975
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,960
We need to move
outside the circle.

976
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,920
The nearest safe
town is Little Brook.

977
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,920
You wanna step down
from there, ma'am?

978
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,920
How come the soldiers
don't know this?

979
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,520
Because their
communications are down.

980
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:40,920
They're completely
in the dark.

981
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,560
I'm not going to ask
you again, ma'am.

982
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:43,920
Please listen to me.

983
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,520
We could all die here.

984
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,040
Get her off of there.

985
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,000
Is it true?

986
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:58,920
If you open your mouth
about this to anyone again

987
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,480
you will be arrested.

988
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,920
Is that clear?

989
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,640
Yes.

990
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:07,640
And I don't want
to see that map again.

991
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:09,880
Release her.

992
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:24,640
James, you'll be happy to know
the bomber is on its way.

993
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:28,280
And two 50 megaton warheads
will launch at 16:00.

994
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,200
Yes.

995
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,000
What do you mean
we lost the plane?

996
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:54,120
Yes.

997
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,920
Thank you.

998
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,720
An EM pulse took
out the bomber.

999
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,880
The warheads
exploded in mid air.

1000
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:02,920
They have to try again.

1001
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:03,920
Send another plane.

1002
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,680
James, the skies
are unflyable.

1003
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:06,800
We'll lose them all.

1004
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:07,720
They have to try.

1005
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:08,720
Send 20 planes.

1006
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:09,480
One might get through.

1007
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,440
James.

1008
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:15,000
James, you've got to think
of something else fast.

1009
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:17,840
There's got to
be another way.

1010
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,160
: We've got
to get out of here.

1011
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:22,920
Why would the soldiers
keep us here if it isn't safe?

1012
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,600
Because they
don't anything.

1013
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:27,200
They're just following
their last orders.

1014
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,840
Communications have
gotten so bad

1015
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,000
they can't even contact
their superiors.

1016
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,000
What do you want to do?

1017
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,320
Dr. Mayfield was right
when he said

1018
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,840
the comet might hit Earth.

1019
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,640
I think we should go.

1020
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:49,680
We're in.

1021
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,000
Come on.

1022
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,920
It's around here.

1023
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,440
This one.

1024
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:22,560
Those poor people.

1025
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,840
I feel so bad
leaving them.

1026
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:26,880
You did everything
you could, Cyn.

1027
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:34,200
Gentlemen, I have a new plan
that just might work.

1028
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,920
We're going to detonate at
the bottom of the ocean,

1029
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,680
the Marianna Trench, the deepest
point of the Earth's crust.

1030
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:40,920
Dr. Elman?

1031
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,240
Yes, the ocean crust is thin
enough that the blast

1032
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:46,920
could go right through
to lithosphere and, yes,

1033
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,480
it could conceivably push
the planet back into alignment.

1034
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:54,000
The Marianna Trench is over
36,000 feet deep, doctor.

1035
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:57,280
How do you plan
on getting there?

1036
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:58,920
Submarine.

1037
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,800
Unfortunately, doctor, we don't
have any that are operational.

1038
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,280
What do you mean you don't
have any that are operational?

1039
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:06,520
EM interference crippled
the onboard computers

1040
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,720
that control
the nuclear reactors.

1041
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:11,320
Are you telling me there's
not a single sub out there?

1042
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,120
That's right.

1043
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:16,040
That's not exactly true,
General.

1044
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:19,720
The Russians have an old diesel
sub they still train on.

1045
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,680
She isn't pretty,
but she's running.

1046
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,480
She's on the west coast for an international training exercise.

1047
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:44,000
Open that bunker.

1048
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:14,280
I guess they're still ordering
everyone to the church.

1049
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:16,440
Shhh...

1050
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,040
I can hear it.

1051
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,320
Hear what?

1052
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,920
An EM pulse tone.

1053
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,360
What's an EM pulse tone?

1054
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,920
Electromagnetic shockwave.

1055
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,360
It's a burst of
electromagnetic energy

1056
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:30,280
coming from the mini pole.

1057
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:37,920
That sub should be in
the harbour by now.

1058
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:43,920
What is that noise?

1059
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:44,920
A pulse tone.

1060
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,160
Cut the engine, dad.

1061
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,080
Now?

1062
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:48,760
Stop the car right now!

1063
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:10,680
What was that?

1064
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:17,360
There it is.

1065
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,120
Oh my God.

1066
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:24,920
Turn the car off, Michael!

1067
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,080
Turn it off!

1068
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:31,680
Everything electronic has
to be turned off:

1069
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:34,440
cell phones, mp3 players,
everything!

1070
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:36,000
Get rid of your
watch, Michael!

1071
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:45,880
I hope those guys remember
to cut their engine.

1072
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,400
Cut your engine!

1073
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,120
Cut your engine!

1074
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,040
Cut your engine!

1075
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:52,680
I think it passed.

1076
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:54,920
Michael, what's wrong?

1077
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,520
Dad, are you okay?

1078
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:00,680
Can you drive?

1079
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,400
Sure.

1080
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:09,720
James, check the engine.

1081
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,440
We've got no time
to waste.

1082
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,920
The battery and
starter are fried.

1083
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:34,360
It looks like we're an hour
from getting out of the circle.

1084
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:36,280
We need to get my
father to a hospital.

1085
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,240
What's wrong?

1086
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:38,480
He has a pacemaker.

1087
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:39,760
I think the storm
shorted it out.

1088
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,800
Oh God.

1089
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:15,920
How are we doing?

1090
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:16,760
Good.

1091
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:18,000
Give it a try.

1092
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,920
It is an honour,
General Mayfield.

1093
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,640
Captain Yolenkov,
this is Dr. James Mayfield.

1094
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,240
Captain.

1095
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,920
I see the resemblance.

1096
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,920
There are two warheads in
the back of that truck.

1097
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:39,560
So, we work together
to save world, no?

1098
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:40,920
Yes.

1099
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,920
Dr. Mayfield will formulate
the detonation sequence.

1100
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,040
My ship, she's strong as ox,
but not so fast you know.

1101
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:51,000
Yes, we know.

1102
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,320
The closest town
is Clarksville.

1103
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:04,360
We past it a
few minutes ago.

1104
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:05,920
Maybe they have
a hospital.

1105
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:06,680
No.

1106
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:07,600
Don't go back.

1107
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:08,640
I'm okay.

1108
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,480
Just get out
of the circle.

1109
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:17,840
Oh no.

1110
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:18,920
Not again.

1111
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,000
: We've gotta get
out of here fast.

1112
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:42,720
Get out or
I'll blow your head off.

1113
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,000
Okay.

1114
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:47,600
Get out or I'll
kill all of you.

1115
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:48,960
Please, my father is
having a heart attack.

1116
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,080
We need to get him
to a hospital.

1117
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:54,560
Get out or I'll put
him out of his misery.

1118
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:55,920
Take it easy.

1119
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,640
We're going.

1120
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:04,000
Get out.

1121
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:26,360
Ahhh!

1122
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:27,840
Ugh!

1123
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,200
Dad!

1124
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,920
What are conditions
in Mariana Trench?

1125
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,440
Expect seismic activity
like nothing you've ever seen.

1126
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,720
You should warn your crew
that the steam vents

1127
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:08,560
will be heating up the ocean
causing violent current shifts.

1128
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,920
All this from rock
hitting Earth.

1129
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,840
Technically, the comet fragment
was made from ice,

1130
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,880
but yes.

1131
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:20,000
So tell me, Dr. Mayfield,
you plan to detonate these

1132
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:22,600
bombs at one time?

1133
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,920
No, not exactly.

1134
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,840
In order to generate 100
megaton explosion

1135
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:29,080
I need to formulate
a detonation sequence

1136
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:32,360
just milliseconds apart.

1137
01:13:32,440 --> 01:13:37,040
You know that this vessel
cannot outrun such a shockwave.

1138
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:43,640
We know.

1139
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:47,720
Your crew, captain,
do they know?

1140
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:50,720
They have volunteered for
this mission in order

1141
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,240
to save their families.

1142
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,400
Outrunning the shockwave
is the least of our worries.

1143
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,000
It's fried, Shane.

1144
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,240
You know you can't start a car without the battery.

1145
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:17,720
Cars in the old days
didn't have batteries.

1146
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:19,320
They used to be started
by hand cranks.

1147
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:21,320
Yeah, well we don't have
a hand crank

1148
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,040
and this is a modern car.

1149
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:25,920
You don't need a battery
to drive either.

1150
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,720
All we need to do is
capture an electrical charge

1151
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:30,440
that will help ignite
the spark plugs.

1152
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:31,960
And where are we going
to get that from?

1153
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:51,680
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

1154
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,840
No one has.

1155
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,760
We're witnessing a geological
event that hasn't happened

1156
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:59,320
on a scale
in millions of years.

1157
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:04,880
What creates such hell?

1158
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,800
Massive tectonic movements.

1159
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:10,760
How will this
affect the mission?

1160
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:13,920
Well, it makes it
nearly impossible.

1161
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:19,960
Ahhh!

1162
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,720
Ahhh!

1163
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:29,920
Ahhh!

1164
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,120
Dad.

1165
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:07,120
Dad.

1166
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:08,800
I'm okay.

1167
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:14,160
We have lost one engine.

1168
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:16,800
Power will be
50 percent.

1169
01:18:30,240 --> 01:18:31,400
Hi.

1170
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:41,080
Can Shane really do what
he says he's doing?

1171
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:43,720
All I know is Shane loves
working with cars.

1172
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:46,800
He's the biggest greaser
at our school.

1173
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:56,080
Better hurry up
with that, Shane.

1174
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:22,120
100 meters from bottom.

1175
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:23,880
Almost in position.

1176
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:46,120
Dammit!

1177
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,920
We cannot stay at
this depth very long.

1178
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,280
Do you have
a family, captain?

1179
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:51,440
Of course.

1180
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,560
That's why we're going to stay
here as long as it takes.

1181
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,000
If we die from a crushed
hull or a shockwave,

1182
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:00,720
what difference does it make?

1183
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:04,320
If we fail
the whole world dies.

1184
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:13,160
This is it.

1185
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:14,720
We're on.

1186
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,240
Okay, I've got to set the timer
on the warheads.

1187
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:25,000
Here it comes.

1188
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:25,960
Just about done.

1189
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:27,440
I don't think I should
be holding this anymore.

1190
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,200
Almost there.

1191
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,480
Shane.

1192
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:34,880
Done.

1193
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,400
Antenna.

1194
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:37,640
Tape.

1195
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:40,480
Come on.

1196
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,400
We need to move
away, Shane.

1197
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,360
Shane, come on.

1198
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:58,720
Let's go!

1199
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:48,720
I feel happy dying knowing it
was to save family on surface,

1200
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:51,520
but I am sad that you
must die with your son.

1201
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:55,880
Until a few days ago

1202
01:21:55,960 --> 01:22:03,160
I hadn't seen James
in five years, so...

1203
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:05,800
We're on.

1204
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:21,160
It's done, captain.

1205
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:24,360
Fire when ready.

1206
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,880
It will be impossible to
outrun the shockwave

1207
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:50,200
with one engine, but at
least we'll die trying.

1208
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:56,560
I think it's done.

1209
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:01,320
We just have to pray
that one static charge

1210
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:02,880
has been trapped
in the cylinder.

1211
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:09,720
Come on, baby.

1212
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:13,800
Yeah.

1213
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:17,320
You're a genius.

1214
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:39,920
We've got the greatest
show on Earth here, dad.

1215
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,840
It's a scientist's dream,
isn't it?

1216
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:05,000
Captain.

1217
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:12,080
If you could take us
in to that volcano,

1218
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:15,000
a steam funnel might propel us up out of the shockwave's path.

1219
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:22,160
The hull is not designed
for such temperatures,

1220
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:25,880
but what have we got
to lose?

1221
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:53,440
Our temperature is rising.

1222
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,800
The heat is
expanding the metal.

1223
01:25:14,640 --> 01:25:16,240
Brace yourselves.

1224
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:27,880
Ahhh!

1225
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:32,720
Ahhh!

1226
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:15,720
Thanks to unprecedented
cooperation between nations

1227
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:18,120
we have survived
the most catastrophic event

1228
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:21,920
to ever threaten our existence.

1229
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,760
The Earth has been healed.

1230
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:27,720
The human spirit
has triumphed,

1231
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,320
despite all that has
been lost.

1232
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,160
But we will honour
those lost

1233
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:33,720
with our resolve
to rebuild

1234
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:37,160
and we will rejoice in what
we have been given...

1235
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:39,960
a chance for a
new beginning.

1236
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:47,960
10:00 a.m., perfect time.

1237
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:51,880
And finally, our fragile
planet owes a huge debt

1238
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:54,240
to Dr. James Mayfield.

1239
01:27:14,680 --> 01:27:15,960
He's here.

1240
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:27,000
Dad!

1241
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:37,440
This is your grandfather.
