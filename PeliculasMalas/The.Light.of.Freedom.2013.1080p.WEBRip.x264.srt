- Good citizensof westerville,

3
00:05:44,533 --> 00:05:47,133
I come to you this dayas our nation is on the

4
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:50,400
precipice of war.

5
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,767
Now, some of you here ifought with 15 years ago

6
00:05:52,867 --> 00:05:55,367
in the war with Mexico.

7
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:57,800
I commanded you then, buti come to you today not as

8
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,767
your officer, butas your neighbor,

9
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:03,633
your friend andfellow patriot.

10
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:06,500
Our nation is endangeredby the same imperialism as

11
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,800
it was when we marchedthrough Texas.

12
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,500
Will we do no less whenthat danger is on

13
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,667
our very soil.

14
00:06:13,767 --> 00:06:18,367
[Applause]

15
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:20,567
Ladies and gentlemen,welcome with me now

16
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:22,833
bishop William hanby.

17
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:29,700
[Applause]

18
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,867
- As many of you know,prior to my founding the

19
00:06:32,967 --> 00:06:35,633
otterbein college,i traveled over 4,000

20
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:38,833
miles on thecircuit in one year.

21
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:43,133
During my travels, I sawmuch injustice and hate.

22
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:47,267
It has made me a man ofstrong convictions,

23
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:50,333
and I founded thecollege to serve others,

24
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:52,533
and it included within itswalls men and women

25
00:06:52,633 --> 00:06:55,333
of all races.

26
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:58,300
I have made my voice knownand shown my scorn for

27
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,767
injustice, and I willcontinue to stand against

28
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:03,600
any law that makes it afelony to give food to a

29
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,300
hungry slave or be friendprecious men, women,

30
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,067
and children whodeserve freedom.

31
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:13,433
The fugitive slave lawof 1850 is inhumane.

32
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:18,067
It is absurd that givingshelter to a friendless

33
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:21,133
man, woman, orchild is a crime.

34
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:24,700
We may be boundby a man made law,

35
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,067
but we are more bound bya lord-given conscience.

36
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:34,567
Ohio has alwaysbeen a free state.

37
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:37,867
It was the first statein the union to outlaw

38
00:07:37,967 --> 00:07:40,200
slavery in itsconstitution.

39
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,400
We should stand as boldas the writers

40
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,633
of that constitution!

41
00:07:45,733 --> 00:07:48,067
Today, many of you willjoin the union army,

42
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,200
and you shallbe that bold.

43
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,400
May god bless you as youmake your choice to stand

44
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,167
for the freedom of all!

45
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,633
- How can a christianminister stand on that

46
00:07:57,733 --> 00:08:01,233
platform and support thebreaking of the law!?

47
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:03,167
- Especially a law thatprotects the property

48
00:08:03,267 --> 00:08:05,133
of a person.

49
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:07,400
- A human being cannot besomeone's property!

50
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,967
- When a man-made law isin conflict with god's

51
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:12,267
law, there isno compromise.

52
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:15,967
We choose oneway or the other.

53
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:19,533
- You are nothing buta freedom crusader!

54
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:22,233
- It says injoshua 24:15,

55
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:27,067
"choose you this daywhom you shall serve.

56
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:30,567
As for me and my house,we shall serve the lord!"

66

67
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:40,333
he'd be sending afew items home before

68
00:09:40,433 --> 00:09:42,200
he headed off to war.

69
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,833
- I see.

70
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:45,633

74
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,400

We can talkabout this later. Audrey?

76
00:10:10,367 --> 00:10:11,833
- You know how I feelabout this, Audrey.

77
00:10:11,933 --> 00:10:13,367
- What do you mean?

78
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:15,067
- Any day, Clay will get hisgear and head into battle.

79
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,900
- But it's not just aboutyour brother, is it?

80
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,700
What about bishop hanby?

81
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,567
What about theunderground railroad?

82
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:23,667
- This is about theunderground railroad.

83
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:26,800
This is for thecause of freedom.

84
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,833
- So Emery is joiningthe war, as well?

85
00:10:35,933 --> 00:10:37,567
- If he does,dalin Wright,

86
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:40,167
I don't believe that isany of your business.

87
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:41,967
- Well, with Emery gone,who is to take care of

88
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:44,967
Clay's responsibilities?

89
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:46,633

place among slaves.

Your story's spreadingthroughout the south.

head through Kentucky andfollow the north star.

There's a light on top ofa hill that will

118
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:39,200

120
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:42,833
was a house slave.

He was a cruelman to my people.

125
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,767
He sold me to hisfriend in Kentucky,

126
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:58,600
and after crossingthe Kentucky border,

127
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,333
I broke free from mychains and escaped

128
00:13:00,433 --> 00:13:02,133

00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,900
in this army.

183
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:23,067
Now, take yourcartridge box swing,

184
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,533
put it over your head.

185
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:28,467
Put the cartridge boxon your right hip.

186
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:33,300
That's it. Now take your belts.

187
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,100
Make sure that you put iton with the bayonet on

188
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,233
the left and the capbox on the right.

189
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,300
- Like this, sergeant?

190
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,500
- Exactly like that.

191
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,867
You boys are take itjust like veterans.

192
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:49,767
I think you will bothmake right fine soldiers.

193
00:16:49,867 --> 00:16:51,333
- How can someone keeptrack of all of

194
00:16:51,433 --> 00:16:53,400
this and march?

195
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,067
- Don't worryabout it, son.

196
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:57,633
We'll make surethat you do.

197
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,167
- Don't be afraid.

198
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:39,167
My father's stationmaster, William hanby.

199
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:42,100
I will help you.

200
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,367
- Anna, you startled me.

201
00:17:45,467 --> 00:17:47,367
- Come on, Ruth,we must get home.

202
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,533
- I will not leave untili lead them to the barn.

203
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:52,467
- Ruth, look at me. Focus.

204
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:55,567
You can't run away fromme like this again.

205
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:57,700
I told you, there is abounty hunter in

206
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,633
this area now.

207
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:02,067
You have to stay with me.

208
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:05,067
- A bounty hunteraround here?

209
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,633
- Yes, now youknow the danger.

210
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:09,467
We must go back to dinner.

211
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:11,300
Father will comeback to help them.

212
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,267
- No, please,don't leave us.

213
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:15,900
- I will not go until ilead them to the barn.

214
00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:20,767
I will not eat until ihave given them bread.

215
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:23,900
- Okay, butwe must hurry.

216
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:26,700
- Come on, we'll helpyou, and you'll be safe.

217
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,567
- Now, you just stay hereuntil my father comes.

218
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:06,567
You are safe now, andhe'll know what to do.

219
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,600
- Thank you so much.

220
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,767
- You both need to rest.

221
00:19:10,867 --> 00:19:12,733
- Someone will bring youinto the house for food in

222
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:15,867
the morning.

223
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:18,367
- Just close youreyes and rest.

224
00:19:18,467 --> 00:19:20,733
Everything will be fine,and you will see

225
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,433
freedom's light soon.

226
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:33,300
- Where haveyou two been?

227
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,900
You both misseddinner, and Lizzie,

228
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:36,533
you have strawon your clothes.

229
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,100
- We helped them, jennie.

230
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,100
- Girls, wherehave you been?

231
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,100
Ruth, you have strawon your clothes.

232
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,667
- We helped them, mother.

233
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,500
- Helped who?

234
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,533
- Obviously you've beenout helping runaways again.

235
00:19:48,633 --> 00:19:51,800
- Yes, but I went out andfound her, and she's fine.

236
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,367
She led the runaways tothe barn and give them

237
00:19:53,467 --> 00:19:55,533
food and water.

238
00:19:55,633 --> 00:19:57,267
- Yes, and itwas exciting.

239
00:19:57,367 --> 00:19:59,067
- Was it?

240
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:00,900
- It was wonderful.

241
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,533
- Yes, but the bountyhunter has made helping

242
00:20:02,633 --> 00:20:04,433
the runaways evenmore dangerous.

243
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:06,300
- As excitingas it may be,

244
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,100
and as much as we allbelieve in our cause,

245
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,800
it's simply too dangerousfor you to be running

246
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,600
around in the woods.

247
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,600
- Especially with thebounty hunter in the area.

248
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,933
- Besides, that'sfather's job, Ruth.

249
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:18,733
- And clearly there'stoo much of him in you.

250
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:20,600
- The Bible says thatruth was born for

251
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,533
such a time as this.

252
00:20:22,633 --> 00:20:24,500
- Lizzie, thatwas Esther.

253
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,567
- But that goesfor me, too. Right?

254
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:31,867
- What can I say to this?

255
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,567
- Dear Emery,as I write you,

256
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:43,867
I sit outside my tent in camp.

257
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:46,233
I am happy to be here with my cousin Reed,

258
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,800
and I am very happy you are at home with Liza.

259
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,067
I have established friendships with several

260
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,267
other men, as well.

261
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:55,700
Their names are John billings, Daniel Lewis,

262
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,067
Isaac Griffith and Jacob wolf.

263
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:00,267
I suspect that we shall all remain close

264
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:02,300
throughout the struggle ahead.

265
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,067
We have made ourselves at home, and as I settled in,

266
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,300
I think of mother and father.

267
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,633
I smile when I remember how excited they were

268
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:12,567
about the free soil party and how proud I think they

269
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:15,267
would be that I am fighting for the cause.

270
00:21:15,367 --> 00:21:17,467
I can still hear them arguing with dull faces

271
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:20,900
that free men on free sale made for a morally and

272
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:24,633
financially better way than the way of slavery.

273
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:27,200
I remember when mother called them weak, timid,

274
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,700
half-baked men.

275
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,067
I think being here makes a person sentimental

276
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,067
of fond memories.

277
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:36,367
I think of how our family once had been as I look

278
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:40,100
into the faces of these men of courage.

279
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,367
- I can see Liza'sface, as well.

280
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,767
That sweet smile of mysister warms me as I think

281
00:21:44,867 --> 00:21:47,167
of myself and all of thesemen preparing for the

282
00:21:47,267 --> 00:21:51,200
battles thatlie before us.

283
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,633
- We have set up camp near the b and o railroad,

284
00:21:53,733 --> 00:21:55,733
and I have found that the 14th Ohio is

285
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:57,567
filled with great men.

286
00:21:57,667 --> 00:22:00,067
At this point, we're so confident that we feel we

287
00:22:00,167 --> 00:22:02,300
could single handedly defeat the entire

288
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,367
confederate army.

289
00:22:04,467 --> 00:22:08,500
Stay safe and true to the cause, your brother, Clay.

290
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,333
- Talia, what areyou doing here?

291
00:22:23,433 --> 00:22:25,267
Did you escape onlyto be caught again?

292
00:22:25,367 --> 00:22:26,733
- I will not let mysisters be

293
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:31,633
taken to Kentucky.Where's Nellie?

294
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:33,733
- She's in anotherwagon somewhere.

295
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:35,367
We're going together tonight.Now you must go.

296
00:22:35,467 --> 00:22:37,067
- How can ileave you two?

297
00:22:37,133 --> 00:22:39,200
- Quickly, that's how.

298
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,333
Even if you save me, wemay not reach Nellie.

299
00:22:41,433 --> 00:22:42,967
We can't let her go alone.

300
00:22:43,067 --> 00:22:45,867
She's only a child.

301
00:22:45,967 --> 00:22:48,333
I will stay with Nellie,and you will be free.

302
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:49,900
Your spiritshall be strong,

303
00:22:50,067 --> 00:22:51,867
and your feetshall be quick.

304
00:22:51,967 --> 00:22:53,767
Your path shall beordered by the lord.

305
00:22:53,867 --> 00:22:55,933
- Yes, estelle,i understand.

306
00:22:56,067 --> 00:22:58,233
- We have our ordersfrom miss Van lew,

307
00:22:58,333 --> 00:23:00,167
Nellie and I willescape into Ohio,

308
00:23:00,267 --> 00:23:02,500
and I will telegraph adinsheridan in westerville.

309
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,633
That is what willhappen, Talia.

310
00:23:05,733 --> 00:23:08,200
- Yes, we willall be free.

311
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:35,567
[Music]

312
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:37,333
- Did you understandthe telegraph?

313
00:23:37,433 --> 00:23:39,233
It made no sense to meas I was writing it.

314
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:41,100
- Yes, I understandit clearly.

315
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,067
I'd like to senda reply, please.

316
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:44,867

- Yes, i'llexplain outside.

321
00:24:04,633 --> 00:24:06,700

Elizabeth vanlew in Richmond.

325
00:24:12,567 --> 00:24:14,900
She has a passenger namedtalia who is to come here.

326
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:17,900
- Why westervilleand not Philadelphia?

327
00:24:18,067 --> 00:24:20,300
- She is to meet hersister estelle in Ohio.

328
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,367
Miss Van lew believes thatbecause your family is

329
00:24:22,467 --> 00:24:24,700
from Richmond, you shouldbe able to travel with the

330
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,200
run away and not raisetoo many suspicions.

331
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,067
They'll be paying hermaster for a week of

332
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,933

333
00:24:31,067 --> 00:24:33,067

The girl will have paperswith her stating you paid

337
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:40,267
her master for the labor.

338
00:24:40,367 --> 00:24:41,933
No questionsshould be asked.

339
00:24:42,067 --> 00:24:43,667
- How will I gether into westerville?

340
00:24:43,767 --> 00:24:45,733
No one here will believei purchased a slave.

341
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:47,700
- There is an undergroundrailroad station on the

342
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,533

- I can do this, bishop.- Very good.

351
00:25:06,533 --> 00:25:08,333
You have someone youcan visit in Richmond?

- Yes, I do, and they'recommitted southerners.

353

I'm Audrey's favorite.

360
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,233
- Yes, Liza's right.

361
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:29,233
No more pie untilafter dinner.

362
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:30,700
- Sometimes I think i'mthe oldest person

363
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,700
in our house.

364
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,433
- Well, I'm oldenough to get the mail,

365
00:26:35,533 --> 00:26:37,667
and we received aletter from Clay today.

366
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:39,533
- Don't get anyideas, Emery.

367
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:41,300
With Clay gone, now bishophanby needs you working

368
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,300
the underground railroad.

369
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,400
- I'm just concerned thatclay's joining the Yankees

370
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,433
to persuade youto do the same.

371
00:26:47,533 --> 00:26:49,267
- I believe ihave a say in that.

372
00:26:49,367 --> 00:26:51,367
- Yes, but clayinfluences you.

373
00:26:51,467 --> 00:26:53,367
- What influences me ispresident Lincoln's

374
00:26:53,467 --> 00:26:55,067
call for troops.

375
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,867
- I realize thingsare getting worse,

376
00:26:56,967 --> 00:26:58,500
and obviously I supportthe north and

377
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,133
what we believe in.

378
00:27:00,233 --> 00:27:01,967
I am just concerned aboutthe two of you leaving

379
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:03,667
Liza here alone.

380
00:27:03,767 --> 00:27:05,400
- She wouldn't be alone.

381
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,267
She has you.

382
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:09,433
- Yes, Audrey, you'relike a sister to me.

383
00:27:09,533 --> 00:27:11,367
- And you're like asister to me, too, Liza.

384
00:27:11,467 --> 00:27:13,700
And if both of yourbrothers go off to war,

385
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,600
I will take care of you.

386
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,433
- We can makebread every day.

387
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:20,533
- Yes, Liza,that sounds fun.

388
00:27:20,633 --> 00:27:23,067
- Well, I guessthat settles that.

389
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,167
- Emery, you'vealready had two pieces.

390
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:42,067
- Dalin, what is this?- A new hat.

391
00:27:42,133 --> 00:27:43,900
- But you haveto return this.

392
00:27:44,067 --> 00:27:45,900
We need food much morethan I need a hat.

393
00:27:46,067 --> 00:27:48,067
- No, you need anew hat, Julianna.

394
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,700
No more people will lookdown on us

395
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,400
because we are poor.

396
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,167
- None of our friendshave ever looked

397
00:27:53,267 --> 00:27:55,067
down on us, dalin.We need food.

398
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,967
- As for food, I havethat covered, as well.

399
00:27:57,067 --> 00:28:00,233
- Where did youget all of this?

400
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:02,233
- It is my job to get allof this, little sister.

401
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:04,833
- By doing what?

402
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,133
- It is your job to cook,not to ask

403
00:28:07,233 --> 00:28:08,967
unnecessary questions.

404
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:11,533
- You promised me thatyou would never steal again.

405
00:28:11,633 --> 00:28:14,767
- Ha, I did notsteal anything.

406
00:28:14,867 --> 00:28:17,667
Quite the opposite,actually.

407
00:28:17,767 --> 00:28:22,867
- Really? well, I must say...

408
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:25,800
It is a beautiful bonnet.

409
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,100
- It is nice, is it not?

410
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,600
- You know, I never sawmy sister when

411
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,400
we were growing up.

412
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,767
Even though I was a houseslave, and she was a maid.

413
00:28:46,867 --> 00:28:49,433
But soon she'll becrossing the Ohio river,

414
00:28:49,533 --> 00:28:52,700
and we'll bereunited once again.

415
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,767
- I'm looking forward tomeeting Molly very much.

416
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:57,067
- You'll get along great.

417
00:28:57,167 --> 00:29:10,400
[Children laughing]

418
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,400
- Now young ladies,you haven't fooled me.

419
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,800
[Laughing]

420
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,533
- Lillian, are youexcited about staying with

421
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:19,833
temperance yetagain tonight?

422
00:29:19,933 --> 00:29:22,567
By the way, temperance,i will be sending your

423
00:29:22,667 --> 00:29:24,867
mother in for these toes.

424
00:29:24,967 --> 00:29:39,867
[Laughing]

425
00:29:41,867 --> 00:29:43,433
- I was next doorto your house,

426
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:46,100
and I got the girlsall tucked in.

427
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,067
Temperance stillhas your shoes on.

428
00:29:48,133 --> 00:29:49,667
- Ah, not again.

429
00:29:49,767 --> 00:29:51,167
- Yes, and I warned themyou'd be in

430
00:29:51,267 --> 00:29:53,067
for their toes.

431
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:54,667
Thank you so much, netta.

432
00:29:54,767 --> 00:29:56,533
Lillian loves tostay with temperance.

433
00:29:56,633 --> 00:29:58,767
- Of course, welove having her.

434
00:29:58,867 --> 00:30:02,267
I guess I'll go nextdoor get those toes.

435
00:30:06,833 --> 00:30:09,367
- How did you cometo care for Lillian?

436
00:30:09,467 --> 00:30:11,533
- I was in kentuckyhelping Jackson and John

437
00:30:11,633 --> 00:30:13,467
Parker with runaways.

438
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:16,400
Jackson had boarded a boatto help the runaways get

439
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,567
on, and I was in the woodhelping a 16 year old girl

440
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:21,967
and her small sister.

441
00:30:22,067 --> 00:30:23,867
Her sister was Lillian,and she was

442
00:30:23,967 --> 00:30:26,633
three at the time.

443
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:31,333
Slave catcherswere chasing us,

444
00:30:31,433 --> 00:30:35,533
and I could hear thedogs getting closer.

445
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:38,433
I was carrying Lillian andrunning ahead to

446
00:30:38,533 --> 00:30:40,467
lead the way.

447
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:42,933
The dogs caught hersister's dress and pulled

448
00:30:43,033 --> 00:30:45,233
her to the ground.

449
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:49,333
She shouted atme to keep running.

450
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:52,067
When we arrivedat the boat,

451
00:30:52,167 --> 00:30:54,900
I could hear hershouting,

452
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,067
"go, Lillian. Live free!"

453
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:02,900
- Slavery has tornapart so many families,

454
00:31:03,067 --> 00:31:07,467
even my own.

455
00:31:07,567 --> 00:31:10,167
My husband was taken bybounty hunters in an

456
00:31:10,267 --> 00:31:13,700
escape attemptmuch like yours.

457
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,167
It is an abomination thatwill take this country

458
00:31:16,267 --> 00:31:21,500
over a century to recoverfrom, if even then.

459
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,800
I'm thankful for mybrother Jackson.

460
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,667
- I promised that I wouldlook after her for the

461
00:31:26,767 --> 00:31:28,533
rest of my days.

462
00:31:28,633 --> 00:31:32,500
I love her as if she weremy own flesh and blood.

463
00:31:40,867 --> 00:31:42,833
- I'm excited aboutmy letter from Clay.

464
00:31:42,933 --> 00:31:44,667
- Why don'tyou read the letter,

465
00:31:44,767 --> 00:31:49,067
and we will have some pie?

466
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,333
- My dearest Liza, iwanted to take a moment to

467
00:31:53,433 --> 00:31:55,967
write you and tell you ofthe exciting events that

468
00:31:56,067 --> 00:32:01,367
have taken placewith the 14th.

469
00:32:01,467 --> 00:32:03,500
As we marched through the town of Beverly,

470
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,533
we were showered with flowers by the children.

471
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:07,900
I thought of you, little sister,

472
00:32:08,067 --> 00:32:10,133
and knew you would have loved to be here.

473
00:32:10,233 --> 00:32:16,800
The flowers showered over us like a blessed rain.

474
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,967
Is that not wonderful,miss Audrey?

475
00:32:19,067 --> 00:32:21,200
- It soundsbeautiful, Liza.

476
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,467
What else does it say?

477
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:25,533
- We have stopped outside of marietta and are now

478
00:32:25,633 --> 00:32:27,967
being showered with pies.

479
00:32:28,067 --> 00:32:30,433
The patriotic hands of the women have treated our

480
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:32,733
regiment, and the men are cheering loudly.

481
00:32:32,833 --> 00:32:35,067
We are experiencing yet another blessing from the

482
00:32:35,167 --> 00:32:41,167
people of this area.

483
00:32:45,433 --> 00:32:48,133
I must close now so I can finish my pie.

484
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:50,433
I think of Audrey and her pies at home.

485
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:52,300
Could these pies compete?

486
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,600
They are certainly close. Your loving brother, Clay.

487
00:33:01,467 --> 00:33:04,400
Mmmmm.

488
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:47,833
- I see you'rewearing your new hat?

489
00:33:47,933 --> 00:33:50,467
- Yes, I do love it.- You have plans?

490
00:33:50,567 --> 00:33:52,200
- If it's all right, i'dlike to go over to

491
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,167
Ruth's andspend the night?

492
00:33:54,267 --> 00:33:56,200
- That's fine, I haveto work tonight anyway.

493
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,967
- At theshipping company?

494
00:33:58,067 --> 00:34:00,433
- No, I have a few otherthings I'm working on.

495
00:34:00,533 --> 00:34:03,300
- Oh, okay. You have your gun?

496
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,400
- Yes, for safety.

497
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,467
I hear there's a bountyhunter in the area.

498
00:34:07,567 --> 00:34:09,233
- I've heardthat, as well.

499
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:10,900
- Actually, i'mleaving right now,

500
00:34:11,067 --> 00:34:12,700
so I will see youtomorrow, all right?

501
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,333
- Yes, I will seeyou tomorrow, bye.

502
00:34:15,433 --> 00:34:18,167
- Good bye,julianna, have fun.

503
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:25,267
- I can't findthem anywhere.

504
00:34:25,367 --> 00:34:27,067
- What are youtalking about Sammy?

505
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:28,567
- I'm talking aboutkicking someone

506
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:30,233
in the trousers.

507
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:31,867
- Now, why wouldyou do that?

508
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:33,733
- Because my pillow andblanket are missing.

509
00:34:33,833 --> 00:34:36,133
- I'm sure there's areasonable explanation, Sammy.

510
00:34:36,233 --> 00:34:39,067
- Nothing is reasonablewith a boy like me.

511
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:43,200
- I can surelyagree with that.

512
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:46,067
- Well?- well what, Sammy?

513
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,233
- My pillow and blanket.

514
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:51,067
- Samuel, youare ten years old.

515
00:34:51,167 --> 00:34:52,767
That is plenty old enoughto keep track of your

516
00:34:52,867 --> 00:34:54,433
own pillow and blanket.

517
00:34:54,533 --> 00:34:56,267
- I did, I hung them outthe window to air out.

518
00:34:56,367 --> 00:34:58,067
- You did what?

519
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,333
- I put my pillow and myblanket and hung

520
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:02,733
them out the window.Clearly will

521
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:07,200
has put his feet on them.They smelled foul.

522
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,900
- Did they fallon the ground?

523
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:12,267
- I looked on the ground,they weren't there.

524
00:35:12,367 --> 00:35:16,167
Whoever has taken themwill surely regret it.

525
00:35:17,767 --> 00:35:20,967
- There we are- oh, my, Lizzie.

526
00:35:21,067 --> 00:35:23,167
- I gathered every extrapillow and blanket

527
00:35:23,267 --> 00:35:24,700
in the house.

528
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,667
- I would say so.

529
00:35:26,767 --> 00:35:29,467
- And it was thestrangest thing, mother.

530
00:35:29,567 --> 00:35:31,533
- What was?

531
00:35:31,633 --> 00:35:33,900
- I found a pillow andblanket in the backyard,

532
00:35:34,067 --> 00:35:35,500
so I brushed them off andtook them to the barn

533
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,633
for the runaways.

534
00:35:37,733 --> 00:35:39,833
- I believe thosewere Sammy's.

535
00:35:39,933 --> 00:35:43,600
- Getting ready foryour camp in I see.

536
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,067
- Yes, it's so excitingto have all of my

537
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,967
friends here tonight.

What are youdoing out here?

628

- I heard theshots as well.

629
00:41:28,233 --> 00:41:29,433
You didn't fire them?

630
00:41:29,533 --> 00:41:31,233
They sounded like theycame from a revolver.

631
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:33,300
- No. I saw a man with arevolver run south

632
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,933
to the woods.

633

[Girls giggling]

639
00:42:18,867 --> 00:42:21,367
- I am so excited to behaving this special

640
00:42:21,467 --> 00:42:24,233
tea party with all ofyou for breakfast.

641
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,500
Anyone for tea?

642
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,367

00:42:26,467 --> 00:42:27,233

- Yes, please.

645
00:42:29,567 --> 00:42:32,200
- What do you thinkabout last night?

646
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,067
- I think if there's abounty hunter around here,

647
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,967
we should findout who it is.

648
00:42:37,067 --> 00:42:39,067
- You think weshould find out?

649
00:42:39,133 --> 00:42:41,500
- Yes. it is aperfect plan.

650
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,233
A bounty hunter wouldnever expect a

651
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:46,300
group of girls to belooking for him.

652
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,133
- I would notexpect it either.

653
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:50,600
- I think itis a great idea.

654
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,433
- We should getstarted right away.

655
00:42:52,533 --> 00:42:55,067
- And I have experiencein this area.

656
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:58,167
Once I caught johnnytaking an apple from

657
00:42:58,267 --> 00:43:00,933
miss Audrey's orchardbehind her house.

658
00:43:01,067 --> 00:43:02,767
- There's a bigdifference between a boy

659
00:43:02,867 --> 00:43:06,067
taking an apple and a manin the woods with a gun.

660
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,600
- Very good,clarissa-bell.

661
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,867
The first clue.

662
00:43:08,967 --> 00:43:10,833
- The bountyhunter has a gun.

663
00:43:10,933 --> 00:43:12,400
- I think we knew that.

664
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:16,500
- Yes. what men intown have a gun?

665
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,900
- Seriously?

666
00:43:18,067 --> 00:43:19,367
- Pretty muchall of them.

667
00:43:19,467 --> 00:43:20,433
- Let's go into the woods

668
00:43:20,533 --> 00:43:22,333
and begin lookingfor clues now!

669
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,267
- Yes!

670
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:24,833
Let us all go runaround the woods in

671
00:43:24,933 --> 00:43:27,133
our nice dresses andlook for clues.

672
00:43:28,267 --> 00:43:30,767
- Any ideas?

673
00:43:30,867 --> 00:43:32,867
- Maybe we should splitup and two of us go

674
00:43:32,967 --> 00:43:35,267
in that direction.

675
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:39,933
- Maybe you andjulianna head that way.

676
00:43:40,467 --> 00:43:41,800
- So I'll go with Ruth

677
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,300
and Liza will gowith Julianna.

678
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,600
- We need a signal.

679
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,833
- My brothers usuallywhistle loudly.

680
00:43:47,933 --> 00:43:49,833
- Who herewhistles loudly?

681
00:43:49,933 --> 00:43:52,600
- I guess I can.

682
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,067
- Let's hear.

[Silence]

685
00:44:06,133 --> 00:44:10,667
- Perhaps we should justyell for one another.

686
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,700
- Clarissa-bell,look at this.

687
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,533
- I will bethere shortly.

688
00:44:32,633 --> 00:44:34,833
- Hurry! hurry!

689
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:41,100
It looks like arope and scarf.

690
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,933
I am sure it's a clue.

691
00:44:43,067 --> 00:44:44,933
- It looks rather dirty.

692
00:44:45,067 --> 00:44:46,533
- Yes, it does.

693
00:44:46,633 --> 00:44:48,600
- Ruth, you're gettingyour drawers dirty.

694
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:50,133
- How can you careabout drawers

695
00:44:50,233 --> 00:44:52,333
at a time like this?

696
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:52,267

698
00:45:54,467 --> 00:45:56,067
- I think we did.

699
00:45:56,167 --> 00:45:57,767
We found thisrope and scarf.

700
00:45:57,867 --> 00:45:58,800
- Where'd you find that?

701
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,367
- It was beside atree in the woods

702
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:02,700
so I got down andpicked it up.

703
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,800
- So let me guess yougot your drawers dirty.

704
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:08,833
- Yes, sheabsolutely did.

705
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:10,400
- Yes, but I thinkwe're much closer to

706
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,633
finding out who thebounty hunter is.

707
00:46:12,733 --> 00:46:15,067
- And I suppose we'regoing to continue

708
00:46:15,167 --> 00:46:17,133
until we find him.

709
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:19,167
- I know thisis a good thing.

710
00:46:19,267 --> 00:46:20,267
We'll be cautious

711
00:46:20,367 --> 00:46:22,500
and we'll always tell youtwo what we are up to.

712
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,067
- And your brothers too.

713
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,833
Remember that is the deal.

714
00:46:25,933 --> 00:46:28,333
- Yes. our brothers.

715
00:46:28,433 --> 00:46:30,933
- And remember, Liza'sbrother will help too.

716
00:46:31,067 --> 00:46:32,200
- I have no brothers.

717
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,100
- You can have mine!

00:46:56,733 --> 00:46:58,367
the meaning of faithfulness.

721
00:46:58,467 --> 00:47:00,700
I have watched your uncompromised stand to god

722
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,600
and for what you believe.

723
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:05,400
Your family has been faithful to Emery,

724
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,300
Liza and me.

725
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,167
I will fight for freedom and above all be faithful

726
00:47:10,267 --> 00:47:12,833
to the lord who is faithful to me.

727
00:47:12,933 --> 00:47:15,367
I want you to know that I intend on being faithful

728
00:47:15,467 --> 00:47:16,967
to this noble cause.

729
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:19,500
I promise to defend my country against treason

730
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,367
and conspiracies and to vindicate honor to our

731
00:47:22,467 --> 00:47:24,333
glorious stripes and stars.

732
00:47:24,433 --> 00:47:26,067
The last few days have been days

733
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,600
that I'll never forget.

734
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:30,233
We've been marching without pause toward

735
00:47:30,333 --> 00:47:31,833
philippi, Virginia.

736
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:34,467
The men were exhausted and in want for water,

737
00:47:34,567 --> 00:47:35,933
food and rest.

738
00:47:36,067 --> 00:47:38,233
Even then, the 14th are ready to fight.

739
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:39,933
We knew and hoped that we would smell

740
00:47:40,067 --> 00:47:41,667
gunpowder soon.

741
00:47:41,767 --> 00:47:43,567
Scouts were sent out regularly.

742
00:47:43,667 --> 00:47:45,467
My cousin, Reed, and I were honored to be

743
00:47:45,567 --> 00:47:47,467
chosen for such a mission.

744
00:47:47,933 --> 00:47:48,567
- Quietly.

745
00:47:48,667 --> 00:47:50,500
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

746
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,333
Quiet, boys.

747
00:47:51,433 --> 00:47:52,200
Quiet.

748
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,400
Come on, quiet.

749
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,300
Quiet boys.

750
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,533
Quiet!

751
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,067
The enemy could be justdown over there and we

752
00:48:00,133 --> 00:48:02,533
don't want them knowingwe're here, do we?

753
00:48:02,633 --> 00:48:06,700
Okay. Clay, Reed, Jacob,i want you to go down

754
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,567
this road here, easealong the woods,

755
00:48:08,667 --> 00:48:12,067
see if you can seethe enemy down there.

756
00:48:12,133 --> 00:48:14,967
Go ahead and take off yourhaversacks and canteens.

757
00:48:15,067 --> 00:48:17,400
I don't want nothingclanging around.

758
00:48:17,933 --> 00:48:20,167
All right, if you guyssee anything down there,

759
00:48:20,267 --> 00:48:22,533
send one of youback to report.

760
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:24,933
The other two just keepan eye on them, okay?

761
00:48:25,067 --> 00:48:26,067
Let's go.

762
00:48:26,167 --> 00:48:26,933
Be cautious.

763
00:48:27,067 --> 00:48:28,600
Keep your eyes down.

764
00:48:30,367 --> 00:48:32,533
- We scouted ten miles that night and never saw

765
00:48:32,633 --> 00:48:34,667
any rebels, however we did see

766
00:48:34,767 --> 00:48:36,667
where they had burned Bridges.

767
00:48:36,767 --> 00:48:38,333
There was only the reflection of water where

768
00:48:38,433 --> 00:48:40,200
they had once stood.

769
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,133
I ask that you follow me and my company

770
00:48:42,233 --> 00:48:43,667
with your prayers.

771
00:48:43,767 --> 00:48:46,133
Pray that I am an example of patriotism,

772
00:48:46,233 --> 00:48:48,633
that if we should need reinforcements,

773
00:48:48,733 --> 00:48:50,867
I may inspire others to enroll as faithful

774
00:48:50,967 --> 00:48:52,767
defenders of the union.

775
00:48:52,867 --> 00:48:55,367
We in the 14th Ohio volunteers have pledged

776
00:48:55,467 --> 00:48:59,133
ourselves to a no more noble sacrifice than to

777
00:48:59,233 --> 00:49:02,567
further peace for all men no matter their color

778
00:49:02,667 --> 00:49:05,167
and for our government's enduring honor.

779
00:49:05,267 --> 00:49:07,300
I must now close as my regimen has been told

780
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,067
to remove all that is encombering us.

781
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:13,133
We're making a large pile of napsacks, haversacks,

782
00:49:13,233 --> 00:49:15,633
blankets and all our articles so we can move

783
00:49:15,733 --> 00:49:18,067
on in double quick time.

784
00:49:18,133 --> 00:49:23,733
We should arrive near philippi at daybreak.

785
00:49:23,833 --> 00:49:26,300
My best to you and your family.

786
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,067
Yours, Clay.

787
00:49:31,067 --> 00:49:33,900
- We need to rememberclay in our prayers.

788
00:49:34,067 --> 00:50:08,900
*

789
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,233
- please, is anyone there?

790
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:13,400
Is this the station?

791
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,300
Please!

792
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,700
I'm a passenger and i'vebeen sent by an agent.

793
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:18,967
I've been chased in thenight by slave cathcers

794
00:50:19,067 --> 00:50:21,867
and have lost my conductor.

795
00:50:21,967 --> 00:50:24,600
I've been followingthe north star.

796
00:50:30,567 --> 00:50:31,567
- Come sit down.

797
00:50:31,667 --> 00:50:33,300
I will get you some bread.

798
00:50:39,533 --> 00:50:41,200
My name is Molly.

799
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:43,533
- I'm estelle.

800
00:50:53,767 --> 00:50:56,100
But I will singof thy power,

801
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:00,200
yea, I will sing aloud ofthy mercy in the morning,

802
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:03,200
for thou has been mydefense and refuge

803
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:05,167
in the days of my trouble.

804
00:51:05,267 --> 00:51:07,067
- You can read?

805
00:51:07,133 --> 00:51:09,900
- I learned to when I wasyoung and lived in Virginia.

806
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,600
- My brother can read.

807
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:17,067
His name is Samuel and i'mmeeting him in Ohio soon.

808
00:51:17,167 --> 00:51:19,467
He has promisedto teach me how.

809
00:51:19,567 --> 00:51:21,167
- I'm on myway to Ohio too.

810
00:51:21,267 --> 00:51:23,567
I'm going to meet mysister, Talia, there.

811
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:25,500
- Perhaps wecan go together.

812
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:27,200
There is to be a boatat the Ohio river

813
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,900
in three nights.

814
00:51:29,067 --> 00:51:31,467
- Yes. yes, iwould love to go.

815
00:51:36,967 --> 00:51:38,400
- I'm really happy tohelp Jackson and the

816
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,567
runaways, but I just keepthinking of my sister.

817
00:51:41,667 --> 00:51:43,967
- You'll have to keepyour focus, Samuel.

818
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:45,967
Keep focused on yourfreedom and the

819
00:51:46,067 --> 00:51:47,800
freedom of others.

820
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:50,167
One at a time, we willhelp set them free.

821
00:51:50,267 --> 00:51:51,833
- But I just keepthinking that--

822
00:51:51,933 --> 00:51:54,100
- no, keep your focus.

823
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,567
The promise landis obtainable now.

824
00:51:57,667 --> 00:51:59,667
Israel was caught inslavery for hundreds of

825
00:51:59,767 --> 00:52:02,133
years and walked inthe desert away

826
00:52:02,233 --> 00:52:03,833
from the promise.

827
00:52:03,933 --> 00:52:06,367
Do not let your mindget caught there.

828
00:52:06,467 --> 00:52:08,100
- You're right.

829
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,067
I can't let my focus becontrolled by my emotions.

830
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,633
And I have to keep myfaith that Molly will find

831
00:52:13,733 --> 00:52:15,933
freedom just as I have.

832
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:20,067
- Free yourself from thephilosophy of slavery.

833
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,167
See yourself as free.

834
00:52:22,267 --> 00:52:25,233
See Molly as free.

835
00:52:25,333 --> 00:52:27,233
With that focus, Samuel,the lord will strengthen

836
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:29,133
you with his faith.

837
00:52:29,233 --> 00:52:32,633
You will be able to seewith the eye of faith.

838
00:53:28,733 --> 00:53:31,133
- You find any tracks?

839
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,267
- Yeah. I think so.

840
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,467
- Look at this.

841
00:53:39,567 --> 00:53:42,533
- John parkeris a wanted man.

842
00:53:42,633 --> 00:53:44,200
And we who are withhim are just as

843
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:45,533
valuable to him.

844
00:53:45,633 --> 00:53:47,200
- $1,000 dollars?

845
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:49,367
Who has that much money?

846
00:53:49,467 --> 00:53:50,700
- I'm sure the localslave owners

847
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,367
have gotten together.

848
00:53:52,467 --> 00:53:54,833
- It doesn'y saywhere to take them.

849
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:56,367
- The bounty hunterswouldn't know where to

850
00:53:56,467 --> 00:53:57,533
take any of us.

851
00:53:57,633 --> 00:53:59,500
- Then why post flyers?

852
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:04,133
- To use fear as aweapon to stop us.

853
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:14,067
[Gunfire in distance]

854
00:54:14,133 --> 00:54:15,633
- Sounds like somebody'sout here besides us.

855
00:54:15,733 --> 00:54:19,600
- Okay. we go togethertowards the shot.

856
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,433
I'll distract thebounty hunters and

857
00:54:21,533 --> 00:54:23,533
you help the runaway.

858
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,300
- Where's the north star?

859
00:54:48,267 --> 00:54:49,633
- It's okay, ma'am.We're here to help you.

860
00:54:49,733 --> 00:54:50,600
We have a boatat the river

861
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:51,633
and we'll take you across.

862
00:54:51,733 --> 00:54:52,633
- But I was being chased.

863
00:54:52,733 --> 00:54:54,933
- We must get tothe boat quick.

864
00:55:05,133 --> 00:55:06,867
- Here's some water.

865
00:55:11,067 --> 00:55:12,467
This will warm you.

866
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,667
Would you like some bread?

867
00:55:22,867 --> 00:55:25,133
- Do you needanything else?

868
00:55:25,233 --> 00:55:27,167
- Oh, no. Not rightnow, ma'am.

869
00:55:27,267 --> 00:55:28,800
You've done so much.

870
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,367
- Okay. just restfor a moment.

871
00:55:32,767 --> 00:55:35,400

The lord looseththe prisoners.

878
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:57,300
- I am so thankful.

00:55:57,833 --> 00:55:59,633
- We will help you get tothe next station, Isabelle.

880
00:55:59,733 --> 00:56:01,300
Don't worry.

881
00:56:02,467 --> 00:56:05,300
- The lord blessthee and keep thee.

- The lord willprotect you,

887
00:56:15,733 --> 00:56:18,133
Isabelle, and getto you Canada.

888
00:56:26,067 --> 00:56:28,233
- My brother Emery, I have just finished

889
00:56:28,333 --> 00:56:30,367
fighting in the battle of philippi.

890
00:56:30,467 --> 00:56:32,700
I could hear your voice encourage me.

891
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,967
After leaving behind much of our gear,

892
00:56:35,067 --> 00:56:37,767
we marched on to philippi in double time.

893
00:56:37,867 --> 00:56:40,200
There was a woman favoring the rebs

894
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:43,600
that spotted us and fired a pistol at us.

895
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,733
This started our Cannon fire.

896
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:48,133
As we advanced on the town those rebs

897
00:56:48,233 --> 00:56:49,867
were not ready for us.

898
00:56:49,967 --> 00:56:51,633
It was a site of victory.

899
00:56:51,733 --> 00:56:53,800
The confederates were asleep from the effect of

900
00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:56,067
their whiskey and the convincing tones of

901
00:56:56,133 --> 00:56:58,500
our artillery finally awakened them

902
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,967
to their perilous situation.

903
00:57:01,067 --> 00:57:03,300
The rebs began running from their tents

904
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,267
as they attempted to dress.

905
00:57:05,367 --> 00:57:07,100
- Don't worry aboutyour fancy stuff, boys!

906
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,533
Grab your guns and go!

907
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:10,767
The Yankees are coming!

908
00:57:11,267 --> 00:57:12,967
- Come on boys, come on!

909
00:57:13,067 --> 00:57:14,967
- The value of the spoil was amazing.

910
00:57:15,067 --> 00:57:17,900
It was quite a contrast, as before this, we had

911
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:20,400
nothing to eat but hard bread and raw ham.

912
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,367
Now the camp is filled with activity,

913
00:57:22,467 --> 00:57:25,533
food and laughter although we're dealing with picket

914
00:57:25,633 --> 00:57:29,067
fire nightly and ready for more battles ahead.

915
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,133
I'm finding that my time with the 14th Ohio

916
00:57:31,233 --> 00:57:32,767
has changed me.

917
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:35,467
I know I'm a more noble man.

918
00:57:35,567 --> 00:57:39,200
I know I will stand strong in the next battle

919
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:40,767
that lies ahead.

920
00:57:40,867 --> 00:57:43,067
Your brother, Clay.

921
00:57:44,333 --> 00:57:45,767
That's it.

922
00:57:45,867 --> 00:57:47,267
What do you think?

923
00:57:47,367 --> 00:57:49,933
- It was a veryinteresting story.

924
00:57:50,067 --> 00:57:51,433
- Yes. it was.

925
00:57:51,533 --> 00:57:53,200
- I'm sure the graybacks won't always

926
00:57:53,300 --> 00:57:54,467
be so foolish.

927
00:57:54,567 --> 00:57:57,067
- There will be strugglesahead without a doubt.

928
00:57:57,133 --> 00:57:58,867
- And you need to go.

929
00:57:58,967 --> 00:58:01,500
- Yes. I do.

930
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,867
I can't sit hereany longer while

931
00:58:02,967 --> 00:58:05,567
Clay is out there.

932
00:58:08,267 --> 00:58:10,600
This is everythingthat Clay and I have.

933
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:11,933
It will be enough tohelp you take care

934
00:58:12,067 --> 00:58:14,700

935
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,067
- Emery, youdon't have to.

936
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,667

938

- I know a chaplain whois going to meet

939
00:58:21,667 --> 00:58:24,133

940
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,200
I'm going with him.

941
00:58:33,967 --> 00:58:37,167
- Okay, so we need to goover what we know now.

942
00:58:37,267 --> 00:58:40,333
- Well, we havea rope and scarf.

943
00:58:40,733 --> 00:58:42,467
- I took the scarfto the general store.

944
00:58:42,567 --> 00:58:44,100
Mrs. young said thatit is a fabric

945
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,867
and pattern they sell.

946
00:58:45,967 --> 00:58:47,767
- Did you ask her whoshe had sold it to?

947
00:58:47,867 --> 00:58:50,700
- Yes, and she couldn'tremember exactly.

948
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,200
However they were allpeople she knew from town.

949
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:55,200
- Did she havereceipts of the sales?

950
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:58,467
- Oh, yes, but she told Mei shouldn't be so nosey.

951
00:59:00,233 --> 00:59:01,867
- What about the rope?

952
00:59:01,967 --> 00:59:03,700
- Not at thegeneral store.

953
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,667
- I checked at the horsestable in town.

954
00:59:05,767 --> 00:59:07,067
There's nothing like it.

955
00:59:07,133 --> 00:59:08,967
- I checked the Baker andblacksmith and did not

956
00:59:09,067 --> 00:59:10,733
see anything like it.

957
00:59:10,833 --> 00:59:13,600
- You checkedthe blacksmith?

958
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:15,800
- Yes. he seemed tothink it odd I was so

959
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:19,067
interested in his work.

960
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:21,567
- Well, we need tofind this rope in town.

961
00:59:21,667 --> 00:59:23,933
There has to be moreof it somewhere.

962
00:59:24,067 --> 00:59:25,800
- I heard Emery tell willthat the gun that was

963
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,800
fired in the woodswas a revolver.

964
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:29,300
He said there weren't toomany people in town

965
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,667
who own revolvers.

966
00:59:30,767 --> 00:59:32,833
- That's good to know.

967
00:59:32,933 --> 00:59:34,733
- I think we shouldfollow the money.

968
00:59:34,833 --> 00:59:35,800
- What do you mean?

969
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,833
- Someone in town shouldhave a lot more money.

970
00:59:37,933 --> 00:59:38,933
- That's true.

00:59:39,067 --> 00:59:41,200
There are reports of fourrunaways being caught.

972
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:42,800
Maybe we shouldcheck with the bank.

973
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:46,067
- I don't think Mr. ripinat the bank will help us.

974
00:59:46,167 --> 00:59:48,067
We need to keep a lookoutfor a man with a new

976

It was written by myeldest son, Benjamin.

1103
01:07:19,067 --> 01:07:20,633
Many union soldiers singit and call it the

1104
01:07:20,733 --> 01:07:22,067
song of contraband.

01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:24,567

helped keep my baby sisterfrom being taken from me

1112
01:07:37,067 --> 01:07:38,467
several years ago.

1113
01:07:38,567 --> 01:07:40,300
I will never forget her.

1114
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,367

1124
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:56,900
However, someone insistedon coming with me.

1125
01:08:57,067 --> 01:08:57,733

1143
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,233

- Nice to meet you men.

1151
01:09:53,567 --> 01:09:56,067
- Now over there, that'ssergeant reicheldeifer.

1152
01:09:56,133 --> 01:09:57,900
But don't you call him sir,because nothing will

1153
01:09:58,067 --> 01:10:00,100
make a sergeant madderthan being called sir.

1154
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,933
- Okay, i'llkeep that in mind.

1155
01:10:02,033 --> 01:10:04,533
- You men are alldoing a fine job.

1156
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:07,567
I know how rough it ison your families and the

1157
01:10:07,667 --> 01:10:11,367
price you may for thelives of others is high,

1158
01:10:11,467 --> 01:10:14,300
but their freedom andthe union's cause is

1159
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,667
valuable to life itself.

1160
01:10:19,433 --> 01:10:36,800
[Children laughing]

1161
01:10:47,133 --> 01:10:55,633

01:10:57,967 --> 01:10:59,900
- They remind meof Stella and I.

1164
01:11:00,067 --> 01:11:04,067
When we were little, weplayed like that everyday.

1165
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:06,767

- And they will neverhave to let each other go.

1167

The future will bedifferent for them.

1168
01:11:12,100 --> 01:11:15,467
- Freeing Stella andsending her to Canada

1169
01:11:15,567 --> 01:11:17,400
was the greatest loveyou could give her.

1170
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:22,567
- I know. I justmiss her dearly.

1171
01:11:22,667 --> 01:11:24,400
- Perhaps you'llbe reunited with

1172
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:26,467
Stella some day.

But they don'tknow where I am.

1204
01:13:36,367 --> 01:13:37,467

01:13:38,767 --> 01:13:40,867
I was supposed to leadyou down to the river.

1207
01:13:40,967 --> 01:13:42,800
They were gonna take youand make John Parker turn

1208
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:45,367

You realize we can'tlet you go back, right?

- Florence Jamison.

1216
01:14:13,533 --> 01:14:15,300
But I will neversee her again.

1217
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:16,367
- The only reasonyou found out where

1218
01:14:16,467 --> 01:14:17,867
Mr. cumberland livesis because some kind

1219
01:14:17,967 --> 01:14:19,900
soul had pity on you.

1220
01:14:20,067 --> 01:14:21,933
If we allow you to returnthen they'll beat and

1221
01:14:22,067 --> 01:14:24,500
torture you until youtell them where we are.

1222
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,733
If you found the strengthto remain silent

1223
01:14:27,833 --> 01:14:29,567
then they'd kill you.

1224
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:32,733
Going back isnot an option.

1225
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:37,300
If your wifepasses through,

1226
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:39,500
then we'll sendher to you.

1227
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:42,500
Before the sun rises, i'lltake you to the station at

1228
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:46,967
red oak and you'll beon your way to Canada.

1229
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:52,333
- I understand, sir.

1230
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,400
- Do you think we'regoing the wrong

1231
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:01,900
way to the river?

1232
01:15:02,067 --> 01:15:03,133
- I think so.

1233
01:15:03,233 --> 01:15:04,500
Tonight we should moveback where the bounty

1234
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,867
hunter caught the girl.

1235
01:15:05,967 --> 01:15:07,900
- We should pray for aclear sky and full moon

1236
01:15:08,067 --> 01:15:09,167
so we can see well.

1237
01:15:09,267 --> 01:15:10,567
- Yes.

1238
01:15:10,667 --> 01:15:11,933
I was taught to trust inthe lord, and that is

1239
01:15:12,067 --> 01:15:13,933
what we are gonna do.

1240
01:15:14,067 --> 01:15:16,600
- My mama told me a storyabout a runaway named

1241
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:20,067
Liza. Liza came thisway in the cold of winter

1242
01:15:20,167 --> 01:15:22,667
with a baby.

1243
01:15:22,767 --> 01:15:24,933
She got to the edge of theriver and heard the dogs

1244
01:15:25,067 --> 01:15:26,333
barking behind her.

1245
01:15:26,433 --> 01:15:28,600
She saw the light at thetop of Liberty hill.

1246
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:30,467
There was no boat.

1247
01:15:30,567 --> 01:15:33,633
So she stepped across theice jumping from patch to

1248
01:15:33,733 --> 01:15:37,500
patch all the way acrossthe river to freedom.

1249
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:40,667
- That is an amazingstory, Molly.

1250
01:15:41,133 --> 01:15:43,067
- She made it acrossthe river estelle,

1251
01:15:43,167 --> 01:15:44,833
and so are we.

1252
01:15:44,933 --> 01:15:45,833
- Yes.

1253
01:15:45,933 --> 01:15:47,833
We're gonna get acrossthat river Molly.

1254
01:15:47,933 --> 01:15:49,567
But now we have to sleep.

1255
01:15:49,667 --> 01:15:51,500
We have to runagain at dark.

1256
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:52,733
- Go ahead.

1257
01:15:52,833 --> 01:15:54,100

vessel unto me.

1616
01:38:20,067 --> 01:38:21,567
I am that man.

1617
01:38:21,667 --> 01:38:25,767
- Yes.

1618
01:38:25,867 --> 01:38:27,333
- You have taken a riskfor the lives of others.

1619
01:38:27,433 --> 01:38:30,067
You know my reputation.

1620
01:38:30,167 --> 01:38:32,600
You know what hurti have brought.

1621
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:35,467
Yet you sit here becauseof the lives of so many,

1622
01:38:35,567 --> 01:38:38,267
because that is the kindof man that you are.

1623
01:38:38,367 --> 01:38:41,733
- Dalin, as someone whopaid for his own freedom

1624
01:38:41,833 --> 01:38:45,867
from a wicked man, I knowthe meaning of captivity.

1625
01:38:45,967 --> 01:38:49,267
I walked many a mile formy freedom only to walk

1626
01:38:49,367 --> 01:38:53,133
back again and spend timein jail until I paid for it.

1627
01:38:53,233 --> 01:38:54,733
- Then you understand howgod can get a hold of a

1628
01:38:54,833 --> 01:38:57,600
man for a greater purpose.

1629
01:38:57,700 --> 01:38:59,700
- I also understand thatthings that appear to be a

1630
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:01,900
risk aren't a risk atall when seen through

1631
01:39:02,067 --> 01:39:04,567
the eyes of faith.

1632
01:39:04,667 --> 01:39:05,800
- It is my prayer thatyou will trust me

1633
01:39:05,900 --> 01:39:07,367
once again, sir.

1634
01:39:07,467 --> 01:39:09,067
And if not, I will dowhatever you ask to again

1635
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:11,500
earn that trust.

1636
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:14,833
I want to join theunderground railroad.

1637
01:39:14,933 --> 01:39:16,667
Just as the slave traderjohn Newton came to

01:39:16,767 --> 01:39:20,700
realize his need,i have also.

1639
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:24,700

1640
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:26,133

1641
01:39:26,233 --> 01:39:27,267
- No, Anna, lottie. Wait.

1642
01:39:27,367 --> 01:39:29,800
It's safe.

1643
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:32,833
- All right, father.

1644
01:39:32,933 --> 01:39:35,933
- What is happening here?

1645
01:39:36,067 --> 01:39:41,067
- Dalin was just sharingthat he is changed man.

1646
01:39:41,133 --> 01:39:42,200
- I would like tosincerely apologize to

1647
01:39:42,300 --> 01:39:44,633

1648
01:39:44,733 --> 01:39:48,067
And Mrs. hanby, I'd like tojoin the underground railroad.

1649
01:39:48,100 --> 01:39:51,600
- Mrs. hanby?

1650
01:39:51,700 --> 01:39:52,833
- It's all right, adin.

1651
01:39:52,933 --> 01:39:54,067
What is it?

1652
01:39:54,167 --> 01:39:56,367
- I have just received atelegraph from Ripley, Ohio.

1653
01:39:56,467 --> 01:39:58,667
It states Elizabeth vanlou has a package ready

1654

- Great. the plan is working.

1658
01:40:06,467 --> 01:40:08,833
You will leave right awayto pick up the package.

1659
01:40:08,933 --> 01:40:10,600
- Sir, with ripley120 miles away I'm

1660
01:40:10,700 --> 01:40:12,700
concerned about travelingso far with them.

1661
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:15,300
I don't know the areasor the bounty hunters.

1662
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:17,700
- Bishop hanby, i'vetraveled the road from

1663
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:19,533
here to Ripley takingfugitive slaves back to

1664
01:40:19,633 --> 01:40:21,267
their mastersfrom Kentucky.

1665
01:40:21,367 --> 01:40:23,800
I know all the localbounty hunters.

1666
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:27,033
I could be your cover.

1667
01:40:27,133 --> 01:40:32,233
If you'd allow meto go with adin.

1668
01:40:32,333 --> 01:40:35,233
- Lottie, whatdo you think?

1669
01:40:35,333 --> 01:40:36,800
- I think he should go.

1670
01:40:36,900 --> 01:40:37,967
No one would expect abounty hunter to be

1671
01:40:38,067 --> 01:40:40,233
helping a fugitive.

1672
01:40:40,333 --> 01:40:41,367
- Please, sir.

1673
01:40:41,467 --> 01:40:44,367
This is somethingi have to do.

1674
01:40:44,467 --> 01:40:46,667
- Adin?

1675
01:40:46,767 --> 01:40:48,467
- If he can be trusted,sir, it would be

1676
01:40:48,567 --> 01:40:50,500
very beneficial.

1677
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:51,767
- I believe you areto do this, dalin.

1678
01:40:51,867 --> 01:40:54,067

1699
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:03,900

1700
01:42:04,067 --> 01:42:05,733
I have grown a lot sincei've been here helping

- That was our plan but isee that wasn't god's plan.

1706
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:22,500
- Jackson has alreadytold me there's room for

They made her house slaveto our master's baby.

1758

We had no tents and had not eaten.

01:47:11,067 --> 01:47:13,500
We marched at such a rapid pace that by 1 o'clock

that afternoon we caught up with the gray back's

1805
01:47:16,667 --> 01:47:19,400
They were cavalry and after a short exchange of

After fording the river, we received word from
