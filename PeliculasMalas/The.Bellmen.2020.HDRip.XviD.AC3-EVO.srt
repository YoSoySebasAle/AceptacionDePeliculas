00:01:55,858 --> 00:02:00,462
Today is the day someone will prove to me
that they are worthy of not just a paycheck,

3
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:02,865
but a
journey into the unknown.

4
00:02:05,034 --> 00:02:07,669
I have
had the honor, with a hard "U,"

5
00:02:07,703 --> 00:02:09,906
- like the Europeans do, "The Honeur."
- Hor-uh-ner.

6
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:11,174
What did I say?

7
00:02:11,207 --> 00:02:16,112
You said "honeur." It's a hard,
but also soft. It's a soft "H."

8
00:02:16,145 --> 00:02:20,750
I have had the honor of being bell captain
of this fine establishment for 12 years.

9
00:02:20,783 --> 00:02:23,351
And a common bellman for 10
years before that.

10
00:02:23,385 --> 00:02:28,090
You might be asking yourself, "How has
this guy had the same job for 27 years?"

11
00:02:28,891 --> 00:02:30,760
I don't need to progress.

12
00:02:30,793 --> 00:02:33,996
I don't need success in the eyes
of my father, wherever he is,

13
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,700
I don't need to do things like prove
my worth to the love of my life

14
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:40,535
that I let slip away and would
do anything to get back.

15
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:44,472
And I'm saying anything, like,
if she came up on this roof right now...

16
00:02:47,576 --> 00:02:48,845
It's enough chit chat.

17
00:02:50,445 --> 00:02:51,580
Let's do this.

18
00:02:52,447 --> 00:02:53,515
Tyler's right.

19
00:02:54,516 --> 00:02:56,351
The time is nigh.

20
00:03:03,625 --> 00:03:06,461
Mm, mm-hmm. Nice.
That'll work.

21
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,868
When we first started, there were
12 potential bellmen in training.

22
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:13,368
The field is now down
to three.

23
00:03:15,637 --> 00:03:18,007
Psst! Steve. Two guys.

24
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,143
I see. As it turns out, there
are only two of you.

25
00:03:25,214 --> 00:03:29,719
Whoever passes this competition will
enter into final bellman certification,

26
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:31,988
in which there are three stages
to your initiation.

27
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:33,622
Let's do this!

28
00:03:35,057 --> 00:03:36,125
Oh, dear God.

29
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:46,635
On your mark,

30
00:03:48,804 --> 00:03:52,808
get set, and go.

31
00:04:47,029 --> 00:04:49,732
Congrats, B.I.T. You've won the
elimination round.

32
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:52,667
Passing the first stage is a
pretty big deal.

33
00:04:52,702 --> 00:04:54,704
Be proud, very few make
it this far.

34
00:04:54,737 --> 00:04:55,871
Mm-hm.

35
00:04:55,905 --> 00:04:58,174
C'mon. I wanna show
you something.

36
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:01,010
Ah! Hello?

37
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:09,018
<i>Um. Hello?</i>

38
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:11,553
<i>Shh. You're safe.</i>

39
00:05:12,388 --> 00:05:14,757
<i>Ow! Someone punched me, Steve.</i>

40
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,892
<i>Tyler, did you punch
Josh?</i>

41
00:05:16,926 --> 00:05:18,995
<i>Uh, yeah. Yeah, I did.</i>

42
00:05:29,604 --> 00:05:30,906
Check it out.

43
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,208
The Bellman Hall of Fame.

44
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:34,276
All the greats are up there.

45
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,244
You know who that is?

46
00:05:36,278 --> 00:05:37,179
Sid Whitman.

47
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:40,016
He started here as a
bellman, just like us.

48
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:42,650
Worked his way up the ladder and
bought the hotel.

49
00:05:42,685 --> 00:05:44,552
Could I work my way
up the ladder?

50
00:05:45,354 --> 00:05:46,222
Sure.

51
00:05:47,323 --> 00:05:49,091
How come you never worked
your way up the ladder?

52
00:05:50,993 --> 00:05:52,695
Yeah, we're having a good time.

53
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,198
Who's the cactus?

54
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:59,902
That's Sauggie. Best
bellman I ever worked with.

55
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,805
Sauggie once stacked 22
bags on one bell cart.

56
00:06:02,838 --> 00:06:04,006
Still an Arizona record!

57
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,608
Sauggie once revived a woman
who passed away in the lobby.

58
00:06:06,641 --> 00:06:09,078
- A week later.
- Still an Arizona record.

59
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:12,715
When Sauggie left, he took a
piece of me with him.

60
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:17,153
Miss you, Sauggie, miss you
every day.

61
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,288
Where did Sauggie go?

62
00:06:19,321 --> 00:06:20,923
No one knows.

63
00:06:22,224 --> 00:06:23,658
What?

64
00:06:23,692 --> 00:06:27,096
Nobody knows. He just didn't show
up to work one day, no explanation.

65
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:29,331
The police searched for weeks.
He just vanished.

66
00:06:30,232 --> 00:06:31,633
Miss him every day.

67
00:06:32,835 --> 00:06:34,136
It's all right here in
the <i>Bellman Handbook </i>.

68
00:06:36,638 --> 00:06:37,306
Go ahead.

69
00:06:43,312 --> 00:06:47,783
So just to be clear, cactus
was a revered bellman

70
00:06:47,817 --> 00:06:49,218
who mysteriously disappeared

71
00:06:50,252 --> 00:06:52,188
and his return is something
everyone covets.

72
00:06:52,922 --> 00:06:54,924
- Yeah, that's pretty much it.
- That's spot on.

73
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:56,792
- It's the story they're all going with.
- 100%

74
00:06:56,826 --> 00:06:59,627
Yeah. Okay. I'm just making sure
that's where we're going with this.

75
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:03,032
Come on, let's get
you into uniform.

76
00:07:03,065 --> 00:07:04,533
- <i>Hey, Steve.</i>
- <i>Hey.</i>

77
00:07:04,567 --> 00:07:08,370
Here's today's checkouts. There's
also a handful early check-ins today.

78
00:07:08,404 --> 00:07:11,407
Last night we were at 80% but
tonight's going to be at full capacity.

79
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,674
I can't wait.

80
00:07:13,876 --> 00:07:16,712
Josh, the goal here is to make
as much in tips as possible.

81
00:07:16,745 --> 00:07:20,049
Now you achieve that by giving
great service 24/7, all right?

82
00:07:20,082 --> 00:07:22,885
Remind the guests if they don't
have cash, all good,

83
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:25,020
they can get
Bravo, the new tipping app.

84
00:07:25,054 --> 00:07:26,822
Okay, let's get this party
started.

85
00:07:26,856 --> 00:07:28,357
All right!

86
00:07:29,725 --> 00:07:30,392
What was that?

87
00:07:36,065 --> 00:07:36,999
Oh, woah.

88
00:07:38,134 --> 00:07:41,737
- Um, you are a big man.
- I'm the runt of the litter.

89
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,973
- You want 1.8 for that property?
- Hey, what's up?

90
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:46,142
Yeah, I can get you 1.2 if
you're lucky. Come on in.

91
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:49,945
- Hi, I'm Rhonda.
- One of us is not ready yet, but we'll be ready soon.

92
00:07:51,313 --> 00:07:52,915
Hi, I'm Jesus.

93
00:07:53,816 --> 00:07:55,650
Can we take your
bag for you, sir?

94
00:07:57,786 --> 00:07:59,955
Oh!

95
00:07:59,989 --> 00:08:02,657
Sure thing, Mr. Ketterer.
He's on his way and he won't be late.

96
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:04,727
JJ.

97
00:08:07,363 --> 00:08:08,931
Hi, I'm Tyler. I'm your bellman.

98
00:08:08,964 --> 00:08:10,132
Hey, my name is JJ.

99
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,734
You're the bellman.

100
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:14,303
A couple of houses on the market that
have been sitting there for the last year

101
00:08:14,336 --> 00:08:17,740
and you're trying to tell... did you just
look at a watch that wasn't on your hand?

102
00:08:17,773 --> 00:08:18,807
I have an itch.

103
00:08:18,841 --> 00:08:21,210
No, man. This is really new to
me. But I feel bad.

104
00:08:21,243 --> 00:08:25,381
I usually don't have people help me
do it and oh... I can't believe it.

105
00:08:25,414 --> 00:08:26,448
Mother Bear.

106
00:08:26,482 --> 00:08:29,018
- I'll take this here.
- No, no. I'm not ready yet.

107
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:31,787
- How about I just take this one then?
- Oh, no. I'm not quite finished.

108
00:08:32,421 --> 00:08:34,290
Rhonda, will you help
me fold these?

109
00:08:34,323 --> 00:08:35,791
Oh, I'd prefer not to.

110
00:08:35,824 --> 00:08:37,226
So, can I bring these
down for you?

111
00:08:38,527 --> 00:08:39,795
What do you think?

112
00:08:42,831 --> 00:08:43,866
I don't know.

113
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:44,833
No.

114
00:08:46,035 --> 00:08:48,103
This is greatly appreciated.
Have a great rest of your day.

115
00:08:48,137 --> 00:08:50,139
- That's good.
- Yeah, okay. Good.

116
00:08:50,172 --> 00:08:52,942
- And that's for you.
- Oh, you are too kind.

117
00:08:52,975 --> 00:08:55,411
No, no, no. We got to keep
it organized, baby.

118
00:08:55,444 --> 00:08:58,480
- What is two dollars?
- Let's get this show on the road.

119
00:08:58,514 --> 00:09:01,283
- Oh, those are binoculars.
- Those are binoculars.

120
00:09:01,317 --> 00:09:02,384
<i>Bravo!</i>

121
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:05,788
Excuse me, could you...

122
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:08,190
Steve?

123
00:09:09,525 --> 00:09:10,793
Houseman?

124
00:09:11,527 --> 00:09:15,798
Wow, it's me, Dave Myers.

125
00:09:15,831 --> 00:09:17,066
Dick-face Dave.

126
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,368
You used
to say that all the...

127
00:09:19,401 --> 00:09:22,037
- Dave Myers. Right.
- Yeah.

128
00:09:22,071 --> 00:09:24,306
What... What
are you doing here in Tucson?

129
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:28,444
Spirifresh, the spiritual
mind refreshment retreat.

130
00:09:28,477 --> 00:09:30,312
- Sounds refreshing.
- Ooh.

131
00:09:33,849 --> 00:09:34,516
So,

132
00:09:36,252 --> 00:09:37,920
can you help
me to my room?

133
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:40,089
Oh, duh.

134
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:45,094
You know Tucson has the most days of
sunshine of any city in the entire US.

135
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:47,896
And one of the
most popular golf destinations.

136
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,332
Steve Houseman, this is crazy.

137
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,004
I mean, I thought you were all
like running a tech company...

138
00:09:55,037 --> 00:09:56,839
win... winning Super Bowl's.

139
00:09:58,841 --> 00:10:00,442
Oh, yeah. No.

140
00:10:01,277 --> 00:10:03,045
You've had this job since
high school, right?

141
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:05,281
Yeah, yeah. Good memory.

142
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:08,183
Still. Same job, still.
Still a bellman.

143
00:10:08,851 --> 00:10:11,420
Well actually now, I
am the bell captain.

144
00:10:11,453 --> 00:10:12,921
Oh, ahoy!

145
00:10:12,955 --> 00:10:16,258
So, after Kate got pregnant with Maddie,
she quit her job at the tech firm.

146
00:10:16,292 --> 00:10:19,595
I make enough money for the both of us,
so, and she is such a wonderful mother.

147
00:10:19,628 --> 00:10:23,098
It's really... I just
love having a family.

148
00:10:23,132 --> 00:10:26,168
It's like the most great thing
you can ever imagine. Ouch!

149
00:10:27,036 --> 00:10:29,171
- No, it's okay. I'm good.
- It's a tight squeeze.

150
00:10:29,204 --> 00:10:31,540
You can just put it right there.
Just...

151
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,209
Yeah, wow.

152
00:10:34,877 --> 00:10:35,544
Steve.

153
00:10:36,713 --> 00:10:38,380
It's great to see you. You're
really good at this, man.

154
00:10:38,414 --> 00:10:39,381
I appreciate it.

155
00:10:39,415 --> 00:10:40,349
Yeah.

156
00:10:40,382 --> 00:10:42,451
- All right, well. Enjoy your stay.
- Oh.

157
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:48,891
Ah, thank you.

158
00:10:49,325 --> 00:10:50,192
Money.

159
00:10:50,993 --> 00:10:54,063
Money. Ooh, money.

160
00:10:54,897 --> 00:10:56,231
Eh. Uh, no.

161
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:01,603
You know...

162
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:09,912
- Trying to leave.
- Yeah, yeah.

163
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,187
It's a game.

164
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,321
Got a busy day.

165
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,359
Getting weird
every time you stop me.

166
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,963
Dave, I've never beat anybody up
in this hotel before.

167
00:11:27,996 --> 00:11:28,864
Yeah.

168
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:32,301
- All right.
- Okay.

169
00:11:32,334 --> 00:11:34,937
- See you around, Dave.
- Yeah, I'll see you around Dave... Steve.

Kelly.

175
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,298
- I didn't know you'd be...
- Oh!

176
00:12:04,032 --> 00:12:05,434
Oh, shh!

177
00:12:06,969 --> 00:12:08,303
Do you need help?

178
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:09,972
Thanks.

179
00:12:19,749 --> 00:12:21,049
I got to go to the lobby.

180
00:12:23,485 --> 00:12:24,987
- It's that way.
- Okay.

181
00:12:33,595 --> 00:12:36,265
Oh, you guys have a
bar and grill, nice.

182
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:37,966
Yeah, you can really
get lit there.

183
00:12:50,612 --> 00:12:52,014
- What's your name?
- Josh.

184
00:12:52,047 --> 00:12:55,050
I don't care. Don't talk to me.
Everything goes through Tyler, okay?

185
00:12:56,084 --> 00:12:57,419
Okay. Yes, sir.

186
00:12:57,453 --> 00:12:58,954
- Just...
- Sorry, sir.

187
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:02,524
I'm with him right now. Hold on one sec.
I need the keys to the golf course.

188
00:13:03,726 --> 00:13:05,093
Excuse me?

189
00:13:05,127 --> 00:13:07,697
The keys to the golf course,
you're supposed to keep them on hand.

190
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:08,597
Ah...

191
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:14,603
Wow, first day and we
can't trust you.

192
00:13:15,604 --> 00:13:17,539
- You can pack up your things.
- I don't have things.

193
00:13:17,573 --> 00:13:18,640
Even better.

194
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:20,743
You're fired, you got 10 minutes
to vacate the property

195
00:13:20,777 --> 00:13:22,511
or I'll have you
arrested for trespassing.

196
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:24,179
No.

197
00:13:26,048 --> 00:13:26,716
Yes.

198
00:13:28,685 --> 00:13:31,587
Josh, I'm messing with you, man.

199
00:13:34,122 --> 00:13:35,725
I'm Michael, Front
Office Manager.

200
00:13:35,758 --> 00:13:38,393
Hey. Josh, I'm B.I.T.

201
00:13:38,427 --> 00:13:39,361
Yeah, I know.

202
00:13:39,394 --> 00:13:40,429
Hey, guys.

203
00:13:40,462 --> 00:13:41,731
Steve, morning, brother.

204
00:13:41,764 --> 00:13:43,800
Met the new guy. Hit
him with the classic.

205
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,601
Nice. You know, Josh.

206
00:13:45,634 --> 00:13:47,669
I trained Michael when he
got hired here as a bellman.

207
00:13:47,704 --> 00:13:50,506
Couple of years later he took a dump
on my face and took a promotion.

208
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:53,141
Weird that I'd want a salary and
health insurance for the family.

209
00:13:53,175 --> 00:13:54,510
Did he really take a
dump on your face?

210
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:57,446
If any of you guys, notwithstanding
Steve, ever want to move up,

211
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:59,248
let me know, the
door is always open.

212
00:13:59,281 --> 00:14:00,717
And become like you or Alan?

213
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,619
- Who's Alan?
- Department head meeting in 15 minutes, Steve, don't be late.

214
00:14:03,652 --> 00:14:06,088
Yes, sir, got it marked right
here in my palm pilot.

215
00:14:08,725 --> 00:14:10,292
- Who's this?
- B.I.T.

216
00:14:10,325 --> 00:14:12,094
No thanks. I just ate.
What's your name?

217
00:14:12,695 --> 00:14:13,562
Josh.

218
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:16,733
Joshua, is it? I should
write you up.

219
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,768
Oh yeah?

220
00:14:19,869 --> 00:14:22,371
Oh, you're
gonna write me up?

221
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,744
I... I should write you up

222
00:14:27,777 --> 00:14:31,046
for that penis head.

223
00:14:32,849 --> 00:14:35,083
- One demerit!
- We don't have demerits, Alan.

224
00:14:35,117 --> 00:14:35,818
Well, we will.

225
00:14:35,852 --> 00:14:38,587
I'm trying to
implement them.

226
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,122
You will be watched.

227
00:14:40,155 --> 00:14:44,159
You will be fired, if
you talk to me like that again.

228
00:14:44,192 --> 00:14:45,494
Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

229
00:14:45,527 --> 00:14:46,595
Sir.

230
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:49,131
Good.

231
00:14:50,365 --> 00:14:52,100
11 minutes till the meeting.

232
00:14:52,134 --> 00:14:52,802
Can't wait.

233
00:14:53,468 --> 00:14:54,536
One demerit.

234
00:14:55,404 --> 00:14:56,672
So, that's Alan.

235
00:14:56,706 --> 00:14:59,341
- Ah.
- Good to meet you. Steve, I'll catch you at the meeting.

236
00:14:59,374 --> 00:15:00,542
Yeah.

237
00:15:01,744 --> 00:15:03,545
- First early check-in of the day.
- Thank you, Stacey.

238
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:04,681
No problem.

239
00:15:05,982 --> 00:15:08,317
All right, you heard her, B.I.T.
Get out and help that lady.

240
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:11,153
- Alone?
- Oh, yeah. No better way to learn.

241
00:15:13,422 --> 00:15:15,290
Yeah, okay.

242
00:15:16,525 --> 00:15:17,760
No problemo.

243
00:15:17,794 --> 00:15:18,828
You got this.

244
00:15:20,562 --> 00:15:21,430
Here we go.

245
00:15:22,331 --> 00:15:23,700
Josh's time to shine.

246
00:15:25,267 --> 00:15:26,134
Who are you talking to?

247
00:15:26,869 --> 00:15:27,737
What?

248
00:15:28,771 --> 00:15:29,806
No... no one.

249
00:15:35,745 --> 00:15:38,380
Hi, I'm Josh. I'm the new B.I.T.
I was wondering if I could...

250
00:15:38,413 --> 00:15:41,684
Welcome to King Saguaro Hotel.
May I have your last name, please?

251
00:15:41,718 --> 00:15:43,786
- It's Long.
- No problem. I've got room on ticket.

252
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,288
Oh, no, no. My name
is Sheila Long.

253
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:48,523
Oh, of course. Miss Long.

254
00:15:48,557 --> 00:15:50,626
Good morning, ma'am. Can I help...

255
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:53,161
Oh, my, what happened?

256
00:15:53,195 --> 00:15:56,331
Bellmen are clumsy and stupid.

257
00:15:56,365 --> 00:15:57,800
Yeah. Please. Come
right this way.

258
00:16:04,774 --> 00:16:07,342
Listen up, Josh.

259
00:16:07,877 --> 00:16:10,646
Do not encroach on us when we're
talking with guests.

260
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,814
Why not?

261
00:16:11,848 --> 00:16:14,282
'Coz you get smashed in the
head with a suitcase, bro.

262
00:16:14,316 --> 00:16:19,287
Now, go back to ding-a-ling desk
with other ding-a-lings. Ding-a-ling.

263
00:16:19,789 --> 00:16:20,690
Ding-a-ling.

264
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,942
Steve.

265
00:16:39,976 --> 00:16:42,879
A few years ago, we were honored to host the
Susan B. Anthony Memorial Golf Tournament.

266
00:16:42,912 --> 00:16:45,948
Needless to say, we were
slammed. Cars were piling up.

267
00:16:45,982 --> 00:16:50,218
So, I took the initiative to help
and valeted a nice woman's Mercedes

268
00:16:50,252 --> 00:16:52,254
and the brothers did
not like that.

269
00:16:52,287 --> 00:16:56,625
In retaliation, they peed on
every single bell cart.

270
00:16:56,658 --> 00:16:58,895
Yeah. Things have been
contentious between us ever since.

271
00:16:58,928 --> 00:17:01,229
You would know that if you
read the <i>Bellmen Handbook </i>.

272
00:17:01,263 --> 00:17:02,497
You just gave me the handbook...

273
00:17:02,531 --> 00:17:04,067
You should have it
memorized, you idiot!

274
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:09,872
Yeah, you idiot. All right. I got to go
to a meeting. Josh, you're in charge.

275
00:17:09,906 --> 00:17:11,239
Really?

276
00:17:11,273 --> 00:17:11,941
Nope.

277
00:17:13,608 --> 00:17:15,377
- Come on, think.
- Hey, Brad.

278
00:17:15,912 --> 00:17:17,212
Watch this.

279
00:17:18,681 --> 00:17:21,516
Hi, welcome to the hotel.
Let me grab these for you.

280
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,019
- Thank you.
- Right this way.

281
00:17:23,052 --> 00:17:26,221
You know it was my idea to
do an all-female <i>Ghostbusters</i>.

282
00:17:26,756 --> 00:17:27,990
You really are an idiot.

283
00:17:29,357 --> 00:17:31,560
Explain to me the difference
between Radicchio and Arugula.

284
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:34,596
Radicchio has no...
how do you say?

285
00:17:38,735 --> 00:17:40,002
I didn't take a single one.

286
00:17:40,036 --> 00:17:41,871
You didn't take any? Oh man.

287
00:17:52,547 --> 00:17:54,316
All right everyone, let's be
Quiet please.

288
00:17:54,349 --> 00:17:56,418
We have a lot to get through and
not a lot of time.

289
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:57,419
Alan, what time is it?

290
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,723
Alan, it's
a flip phone, just flip it.

291
00:18:02,657 --> 00:18:03,893
Alan, what time is it?

292
00:18:05,494 --> 00:18:07,096
- Michael, what time is it?
- 10:25 a.m.

293
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,733
Quick rundown time of everything today,
shall we? Guillaume, what's in season?

294
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:12,969
- Cacti are always in season.
- Ah, ha-ha. Don't I know it?

295
00:18:13,002 --> 00:18:16,072
- Ted, what do you got for me?
- We're close to discovering the source of the smell

296
00:18:16,105 --> 00:18:18,473
coming from the air ducts on the
third floor.

297
00:18:18,507 --> 00:18:20,743
And we all sincerely
hope that you do. Louisa.

298
00:18:20,777 --> 00:18:22,611
Our robe inventory is
diminishing.

299
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:25,413
Until we put a stop
to this robe thievery,

300
00:18:25,447 --> 00:18:27,917
only the people who really need
robes will get them.

301
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,987
Very troubling. Alan, please
find the culprit.

302
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,055
And Patty,
how are the puppets?

303
00:18:33,089 --> 00:18:34,056
Oh, you know, we good.

304
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,892
Oh! Thanks Patty.

305
00:18:35,925 --> 00:18:37,794
We have a lot of
events this weekend.

306
00:18:37,827 --> 00:18:40,428
I want to keep everyone apprised
of where everything is going on.

307
00:18:40,462 --> 00:18:42,832
In the Sahuarita Ballroom we
have the Moishevitz Bar Mitzvah.

308
00:18:42,865 --> 00:18:44,801
Please have the
first aid kit ready.

309
00:18:44,834 --> 00:18:47,904
And in the Tanque Verde Ballroom we
have the 4th Annual Toddler Ball.

310
00:18:47,937 --> 00:18:50,338
So plenty of juice boxes and
goldfish.

311
00:18:50,372 --> 00:18:53,475
In the Saddlebrooke
Ballroom we have Spirifresh,

312
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,577
the Spiritual Mind Refreshment
Retreat.

313
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,947
Now for anyone who is interested
in attending Spirifresh,

314
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,850
they are offering a 4% employee
discount.

315
00:19:04,386 --> 00:19:06,856
Now you might recognize that we
are at a 100% capacity this weekend

316
00:19:06,889 --> 00:19:09,992
and we have some V-very
I-important P's showing up,

317
00:19:10,026 --> 00:19:13,361
including our owner,
Sid Whitman.

318
00:19:13,395 --> 00:19:18,768
And everyone join me in congratulating
Kelly on joining Les Clefs d'Or,

319
00:19:18,801 --> 00:19:22,470
the national organization of
lobby concierges.

320
00:19:22,504 --> 00:19:24,907
Kelly, we appreciate people
whose commitment to excellence

321
00:19:24,941 --> 00:19:29,644
earns them honors like these and makes us
look good in the process. So, thank you.

322
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:36,719
<i>Mazel tov </i>, baby.

323
00:19:36,752 --> 00:19:37,652
Thanks, Patty.

324
00:19:39,021 --> 00:19:43,391
And thank you, Susan. I'm honored
to share this table with all of you.

325
00:19:43,425 --> 00:19:47,763
Every one of you makes my job
easier. Except for Steve.

326
00:19:49,664 --> 00:19:51,133
Meeting is over.

327
00:20:03,846 --> 00:20:04,714
Kelly.

328
00:20:05,748 --> 00:20:07,415
- Kelly.
- What, Steve?

329
00:20:07,449 --> 00:20:08,684
Congrats on the pin thingy.

330
00:20:11,087 --> 00:20:15,157
It's Les Clefs d'Or,
not a pin thingy.

331
00:20:16,524 --> 00:20:17,994
What are you doing right now?

332
00:20:18,027 --> 00:20:19,128
I'm working.

333
00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:21,063
I got a promotion.

334
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,170
I was interviewing and crushing it
so they were like enough is enough.

335
00:20:28,204 --> 00:20:31,741
Let's start the transition. To
the top is where I'm headed.

336
00:20:31,774 --> 00:20:33,976
So, just thought
you should know that.

337
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:39,547
Congratulations. Maybe I'll be
seeing you at the adult table.

338
00:20:39,581 --> 00:20:43,085
Maybe I'll look in your direction
at the table when you see me there.

339
00:20:43,853 --> 00:20:45,154
I'll be the guy
looking at you.

340
00:20:49,892 --> 00:20:51,127
Michael, this is Steve.

341
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,061
Michael.

342
00:20:52,094 --> 00:20:53,662
I need you in the garden ASAP.

343
00:21:02,671 --> 00:21:04,240
God! Jesus, come on.

344
00:21:04,273 --> 00:21:06,508
- What's up, dude?
- Oh, hey. I need your help.

345
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,011
Hmm. Pretty sure the favor scale
is leaning heavily in my favor.

346
00:21:09,045 --> 00:21:13,615
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever. I just lied to
Kelly. I told her I was getting promoted.

347
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:14,784
Why would you do that?

348
00:21:14,817 --> 00:21:17,853
I don't know, man. I just miss
her. I want another shot.

349
00:21:17,887 --> 00:21:19,654
Well, lying to her
is a great start.

350
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:21,157
- You gonna help me or not?
- Of course.

351
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:24,026
But I can't just promote you out
of thin air. It's a process.

352
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,762
- If you were a manager, you'd know that.
- Great, so make me a manager.

353
00:21:26,796 --> 00:21:29,664
All right, I'll see what I can do.
But you got to keep your nose clean.

354
00:21:29,699 --> 00:21:32,234
- Right, if Alan catches you doing anything...
- I can handle Alan.

355
00:21:32,268 --> 00:21:34,136
No messing around.
You can't get in trouble.

356
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:36,504
I'll keep a low profile. I'll
hide in the bell closet.

357
00:21:36,538 --> 00:21:38,540
How come I never get to hang
out in the bell closet?

358
00:21:38,573 --> 00:21:40,109
Because you abandoned us.

359
00:21:41,877 --> 00:21:43,946
I deserved that.

360
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,181
All right, so what's our move?

361
00:21:45,214 --> 00:21:46,716
Try to convince Susan to give
you a shot.

362
00:21:46,749 --> 00:21:50,019
Show her some numbers, tell her I need
an Assistant Front Office Manager.

363
00:21:50,052 --> 00:21:52,254
Great, thank you. Hey, uh...

364
00:21:54,323 --> 00:21:59,295
Let's just keep this a Mike, Steve
thing, you know. Guys don't need to know.

365
00:21:59,328 --> 00:22:03,565
- Why not?
- The whole "being a bell captain for life" is kind of my thing.

366
00:22:03,598 --> 00:22:08,704
- You're killing me, man.
- I know, okay. I'll get you back. I'll get you robes.

367
00:22:08,738 --> 00:22:10,538
- Robes?
- Yeah.

368
00:22:10,572 --> 00:22:11,841
Damn it.

369
00:22:11,874 --> 00:22:13,575
I got plenty of robes at home.

370
00:22:13,608 --> 00:22:14,977
Then just tell me that.

371
00:22:16,312 --> 00:22:19,148
- Let's get back inside before someone suspects something.
- Yeah.

372
00:22:39,802 --> 00:22:42,071
Oh, hey. Steve! This is Gunther.

373
00:22:42,104 --> 00:22:44,907
He is a very important P.

374
00:22:45,975 --> 00:22:49,779
Gunther. Hi, I'm Steve,
the bell captain.

375
00:22:49,812 --> 00:22:53,615
Steve, yes.

376
00:22:55,151 --> 00:22:58,087
Stress, but it's not work
related.

377
00:23:00,089 --> 00:23:03,225
A good soul, unfulfilled.

378
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,797
But Steve can dance.

379
00:23:10,232 --> 00:23:12,134
No. No, he can't.

380
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:16,005
Um, I can dance.

381
00:23:17,206 --> 00:23:19,008
So, you think you can dance?

382
00:23:22,078 --> 00:23:24,579
In your face, Steve. He
pegged you good, Steve.

383
00:23:25,147 --> 00:23:28,784
That was good.

384
00:23:30,953 --> 00:23:34,223
I make this joke because there
is a famous show,

385
00:23:34,256 --> 00:23:38,828
a television show has the same moniker
as these words I just said to you.

386
00:23:38,861 --> 00:23:41,297
I have not seen it because my
studies show,

387
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:45,667
television is observation from a
distance, yeah?

388
00:23:46,135 --> 00:23:48,204
Yeah, but you... yes.

389
00:23:48,237 --> 00:23:49,738
You Steve, captain.

390
00:23:49,772 --> 00:23:51,307
Yes, you can dance.

391
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,376
The universe loves you,
so do I.

392
00:23:55,344 --> 00:23:57,980
But we always safe, so safe.

393
00:23:58,981 --> 00:24:01,717
Here is Sanz Hands
hand sanitizer.

394
00:24:02,351 --> 00:24:03,319
That's a lot.

395
00:24:07,256 --> 00:24:08,891
Okay.

396
00:24:08,924 --> 00:24:11,060
Sorry, you're just so cute,
I can't help myself.

397
00:24:15,364 --> 00:24:17,867
These girls are
definitely feeling us.

398
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,437
Gunther can jump hella far, bro.

399
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,372
- Hella far.
- Why does that matter?

400
00:24:23,405 --> 00:24:27,143
You are so lucky because tonight
I am hosting

401
00:24:27,176 --> 00:24:30,779
one of my very rare seminars

402
00:24:30,813 --> 00:24:32,848
right here in the
conference room.

403
00:24:32,882 --> 00:24:35,417
It only happen two,

404
00:24:35,451 --> 00:24:38,420
maybe three times in a
weekend.

405
00:24:38,454 --> 00:24:41,223
So, I trust I will see
all of you there?

406
00:24:41,257 --> 00:24:43,292
We will definitely be there.
Are you kidding me?

407
00:24:43,325 --> 00:24:44,760
A kid is a baby goat.

408
00:24:46,729 --> 00:24:51,400
Laughter is organic message of
the universe and yet,

409
00:24:51,433 --> 00:24:55,237
no human
vessel can contain it.

410
00:24:55,271 --> 00:24:56,138
Yeah.

411
00:24:56,939 --> 00:24:57,973
Hmm.

412
00:24:59,575 --> 00:25:01,477
Make sure you go to the website because
the tickets, they go like hot cakes.

413
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,045
You know, they go so
fast.

414
00:25:03,078 --> 00:25:05,047
- Paid.
- Ah, look how fast.

415
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,749
- Paid.
- So fast still.

416
00:25:06,782 --> 00:25:09,151
Yeah, we're gonna need to check
our schedules

417
00:25:09,185 --> 00:25:10,886
before we can commit.

418
00:25:18,327 --> 00:25:22,097
When they commit to the seminar
what are they...

419
00:25:22,131 --> 00:25:23,399
what are they paying for?

420
00:25:23,432 --> 00:25:24,466
Steve,

421
00:25:25,134 --> 00:25:27,770
Steve is the captain.
Captain Steve.

422
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,039
Just like the mouse...

423
00:25:31,073 --> 00:25:32,041
the mouth

424
00:25:34,777 --> 00:25:36,879
craves hydration.

425
00:25:36,912 --> 00:25:38,314
Yeah, okay?

426
00:25:38,347 --> 00:25:41,217
So the mind crave...

427
00:25:43,552 --> 00:25:45,254
what is
human word for this?

428
00:25:48,324 --> 00:25:49,191
Knowledge.

429
00:25:52,561 --> 00:25:54,964
Do you know that the human brain

430
00:25:54,997 --> 00:25:57,833
only uses 14% capacity?

431
00:25:59,568 --> 00:26:05,007
The dog
uses 24% of the human brain.

432
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,042
How, Gunther?
I will tell you tonight.

433
00:26:07,076 --> 00:26:08,811
I will tell you
tonight at the seminar.

434
00:26:11,213 --> 00:26:12,281
I can't wait, man.

435
00:26:12,314 --> 00:26:13,749
Why are we clapping?

436
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:18,988
Spirifresh has enlightened my brain
to know what my body is capable of.

437
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:22,791
Don't you want to know what our
bodies are capable of?

438
00:26:22,825 --> 00:26:23,659
- Yes.
- Yes.

439
00:26:23,693 --> 00:26:26,028
- Definitely. 100%.
- At the seminar...

440
00:26:26,061 --> 00:26:28,998
Really I just work here during the
day, but my nights is off.

441
00:26:29,932 --> 00:26:32,468
So now we must go up to the
room, okay, we unwind,

442
00:26:32,501 --> 00:26:35,971
we meditate and then we make
love 1000 times.

443
00:26:36,005 --> 00:26:41,977
But first what always is...
what always is... what always is safe?

444
00:26:42,478 --> 00:26:43,879
Yes, safe.

445
00:26:45,981 --> 00:26:46,849
My Lord.

446
00:26:49,451 --> 00:26:53,889
Yes. Safe. Super safe. Yes.

447
00:26:55,224 --> 00:26:56,726
Can you help me with my bags?

448
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:02,164
They're really heavy and your hands
look so strong and sexually satisfying.

449
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:05,367
Yup.

450
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:08,837
<i>Allons y </i>.

451
00:27:09,438 --> 00:27:10,839
Have fun.

452
00:27:18,314 --> 00:27:19,548
Who's she?

453
00:27:19,581 --> 00:27:21,950
Kelly. Chief Concierge.

454
00:27:22,451 --> 00:27:24,853
She's like the bell captain of
concierges.

455
00:27:25,387 --> 00:27:27,089
Seems like you love her.

456
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,658
We went out a few times a while
back.

457
00:27:29,693 --> 00:27:32,928
One night I was hanging at the bar after
hours, waiting to meet her for a dirty one.

458
00:27:32,961 --> 00:27:34,897
- Eww.
- Martini, you perv.

459
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:36,532
Oh!

460
00:27:36,565 --> 00:27:39,868
Anyway, one of the bartenders just so
happened to be a very handsome young lady.

461
00:27:40,402 --> 00:27:42,604
She got an olive lodged in her
throat.

462
00:27:42,638 --> 00:27:43,672
Everyone starts freaking out.

463
00:27:43,707 --> 00:27:46,075
I hop over the bar and
start giving her the Heimlich,

464
00:27:46,108 --> 00:27:48,143
but Kelly wasn't
familiar with that maneuver.

465
00:27:48,177 --> 00:27:49,378
So, it looked like we were...

466
00:27:49,411 --> 00:27:51,013
Ah, doinking.

467
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:52,147
Doinking.

468
00:27:52,181 --> 00:27:53,849
That was it between
Kelly and I.

469
00:27:54,483 --> 00:27:56,218
I've been trying
to get her back ever since.

470
00:27:56,251 --> 00:27:58,654
- How's that going?
- I'm not good enough for her.

471
00:27:58,688 --> 00:28:01,323
Well, if you don't think you're
good enough, why should she?

472
00:28:04,126 --> 00:28:05,994
Maybe you should be the one
holding a conference.

473
00:28:16,405 --> 00:28:20,342
Do you like this? I just want to make sure
I look cute at the after party tonight.

474
00:28:21,243 --> 00:28:22,578
Yeah, you look cute.

475
00:28:32,521 --> 00:28:33,389
What about this one?

476
00:28:35,624 --> 00:28:39,261
It's great. They're both... I
like them both, you know.

477
00:28:39,294 --> 00:28:40,596
So, I will see you tonight?

478
00:28:40,629 --> 00:28:41,597
Uh-huh.

479
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:43,298
Go ahead and buy that ticket.

480
00:28:44,233 --> 00:28:46,301
Oh, yeah. I'll just... I'll do it
when I get downstairs.

481
00:28:47,035 --> 00:28:47,970
Ah...

482
00:28:49,671 --> 00:28:54,243
Ah, you don't know how to
give massages, do you?

483
00:28:55,144 --> 00:29:00,015
Yes, I do. I was captain of the
varsity massage... massage squad.

484
00:29:00,048 --> 00:29:02,017
I have an idea. Come on.

485
00:29:07,356 --> 00:29:10,225
- Can you believe that guy?
- Okay, he's a complete slime ball, right?

486
00:29:10,259 --> 00:29:12,060
Oh, yeah. No question. I
mean it's a huge scam.

487
00:29:12,094 --> 00:29:13,128
You know him?

488
00:29:13,162 --> 00:29:15,197
Not personally. And this
Spirifresh thing is new.

489
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:17,199
It used
to be called Modern Divinity.

490
00:29:17,232 --> 00:29:18,701
See, my aunt and uncle were
super into it,

491
00:29:18,735 --> 00:29:20,703
they put up their
house, all their savings,

492
00:29:20,737 --> 00:29:23,172
my uncle's foreign feather
collection, everything.

493
00:29:23,205 --> 00:29:25,307
They lost it all thinking he was
going to make them rich.

494
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:28,944
Now they don't even have a feather to their
name. And those girls are in on it too.

495
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,447
Help keep an eye on the
guys for me, would you?

496
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,649
- But I hurt my wrist, Steve.
- God damn it.

497
00:29:40,322 --> 00:29:43,492
I'll sit in the hot bath and you
can massage my neck

498
00:29:43,525 --> 00:29:49,298
and then I'll figure out a way to pay you
back that's equally, physically gratifying.

499
00:29:51,366 --> 00:29:54,236
Careful, you might get wet.

500
00:29:55,604 --> 00:29:56,605
Not a problem.

501
00:29:59,274 --> 00:30:03,479
Ooh, clean your hands
first. Okay, sweetie?

502
00:30:03,512 --> 00:30:04,580
Of course.

503
00:30:16,492 --> 00:30:20,662
Oh, go ahead and
buy that ticket, okay, honey?

504
00:30:20,697 --> 00:30:22,564
Yes, of course.

505
00:30:31,808 --> 00:30:33,075
<i>Spirifresh.</i>

506
00:30:34,744 --> 00:30:35,544
All bought.

507
00:30:35,577 --> 00:30:38,547
Do you know what
I'm gonna do now?

508
00:30:40,449 --> 00:30:41,350
Nope.

509
00:30:41,383 --> 00:30:44,653
I'm going to take a
moment to get ready.

510
00:30:44,687 --> 00:30:47,155
Oh...

511
00:30:50,192 --> 00:30:51,794
Oh, right.

512
00:30:51,828 --> 00:30:54,463
Well, I'll be right outside

513
00:30:54,496 --> 00:30:58,333
whenever you're ready to...

514
00:31:00,435 --> 00:31:02,237
You're so cute.

515
00:31:12,314 --> 00:31:15,685
So, my vacation days expire at
the end of the month.

516
00:31:15,718 --> 00:31:19,588
I'm thinking about going to
Botswana, help build a school.

517
00:31:19,621 --> 00:31:24,159
I just hope one of the babies is an orphan,
so I can sneak him home in my suitcase.

518
00:31:24,192 --> 00:31:25,561
Well, why don't you just adopt?

519
00:31:25,594 --> 00:31:29,732
Oh, no, no, the chances of getting
a white baby are way too high.

520
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:33,435
I love white babies.
I used to be one.

521
00:31:34,704 --> 00:31:36,238
Sorry, didn't see you guys
there.

522
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:39,241
It's been a crazy day. Michael has me
taking care of a bunch of things for him,

523
00:31:39,274 --> 00:31:40,877
you know, assistant manager
type of stuff.

524
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,544
Well, looks like you're just...

525
00:31:42,578 --> 00:31:45,547
One second, hold that thought.
That's a go for Steve.

526
00:31:45,581 --> 00:31:46,816
Yeah, we can move forward.

527
00:31:46,849 --> 00:31:50,753
Ultimately, it is my decision to
make, so we're good to go there.

528
00:31:50,787 --> 00:31:52,254
Great. Over.

529
00:31:53,422 --> 00:31:55,123
It's part of my day-to-day now.

530
00:31:55,157 --> 00:31:57,727
Just making decisions,
delegating,

531
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,295
trying to figure out what to do
with my significant pay raise.

532
00:32:00,329 --> 00:32:01,463
How much you're making?

533
00:32:01,496 --> 00:32:03,900
You never ask a woman her age,
Catherine.

534
00:32:03,933 --> 00:32:05,868
You should know
that, seeing as how old you are.

535
00:32:05,902 --> 00:32:07,737
Why don't you just keep begging
for tips,

536
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:10,572
maybe you can buy some tassles
for your handle bars.

537
00:32:10,606 --> 00:32:13,408
What was it like giving hand
jobs during the Great Depression?

538
00:32:13,442 --> 00:32:18,313
Kelly, um, what are you...
what are you doing later?

539
00:32:18,347 --> 00:32:20,115
I'm going to dinner
with Mr. Whitman.

540
00:32:20,683 --> 00:32:22,085
I'm actually at that dinner.

541
00:32:22,117 --> 00:32:26,355
So that's... that'll be you,
me and Mr. Whitman and all the managers.

542
00:32:26,388 --> 00:32:28,791
Probably, Alan too,
which will be great.

543
00:32:28,825 --> 00:32:30,392
I'll see you then.

544
00:32:30,425 --> 00:32:32,394
Oh, never stops. Sorry.

545
00:32:32,427 --> 00:32:34,864
That's a go for
Steve. Yeah, no.

546
00:32:34,897 --> 00:32:37,432
Let's go ahead
and hire that woman.

547
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,601
She is great for the job.

548
00:32:39,635 --> 00:32:40,937
And let's... let's fire that kid.

549
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:42,537
Okay, over.

550
00:32:43,305 --> 00:32:44,406
Guys, I would love to stay and
party,

551
00:32:44,439 --> 00:32:47,910
but this hotel is not going to
assistant manage itself.

552
00:32:47,944 --> 00:32:51,881
- So, I'll see you guys.
- Woah, who is assistant managing itself?

553
00:32:51,914 --> 00:32:54,616
Steve is. Didn't you hear?

554
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,485
Is this true, Steven?

555
00:32:57,319 --> 00:33:00,656
Yeah, yup that's what... yup.

556
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:01,991
Why wasn't I briefed on this?

557
00:33:02,025 --> 00:33:04,694
That sounds like an Alan problem,
not really a Steve problem.

558
00:33:04,727 --> 00:33:07,596
<i>This is Ops for Alan.
We need you to bring in the robes.</i>

559
00:33:07,629 --> 00:33:09,766
<i>We simply don't have the man
power down here.</i>

560
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:12,735
Copy that. I'll
start collecting them.

561
00:33:12,769 --> 00:33:15,772
This conversation
will be continued.

562
00:33:16,405 --> 00:33:17,372
I look forward to it.

563
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,708
Yeah.

564
00:33:18,741 --> 00:33:21,711
One demerit.

565
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:24,212
It was nice
chatting with you, Kelly.

566
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:38,861
Left, right. One, two. One,
two. One, two.

567
00:33:38,895 --> 00:33:40,797
Now jab up.

568
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:43,700
See you tonight, sweetie. Make
sure your hands are clean.

569
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:50,338
Oh, they are definitely into us.

570
00:33:50,372 --> 00:33:52,942
Yeah, and there is absolutely
nothing creepy about that.

571
00:33:52,975 --> 00:33:54,010
No, no.

572
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:14,663
Hey, you about ready
for that massage?

573
00:34:15,664 --> 00:34:18,500
Oh, honey. I'm not feeling well.

574
00:34:19,334 --> 00:34:20,235
Okay.

575
00:34:21,636 --> 00:34:23,505
I can make you feel better.

576
00:34:23,538 --> 00:34:25,875
I'll see you tonight,
and we can do the massage then.

577
00:34:26,575 --> 00:34:27,844
Are you sure?

578
00:34:27,877 --> 00:34:30,847
Because you're here and I'm here
and the bath is already drawn.

579
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,750
I'm definitely sure. I'd
like you to leave now.

580
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:36,518
Okay.

581
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:51,600
Hey, Sarah, it's Brad.

582
00:34:53,035 --> 00:34:55,504
I... um,
my clothes are in there.

583
00:34:55,537 --> 00:34:58,975
So, I'm going to need my clothes
and... oh, and my cellphone.

584
00:34:59,008 --> 00:35:00,743
My cellphone is in there.

585
00:35:12,521 --> 00:35:14,322
B.I.T. There's a call for you.

586
00:35:22,098 --> 00:35:24,834
- This one?
- Yeah. Pick it up.

587
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:29,806
B.I.... Shit. Josh speaking.

588
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:33,009
Josh, there's a horse
in the stable.

589
00:35:33,042 --> 00:35:34,010
What?

590
00:35:34,043 --> 00:35:36,045
Agamemnon is stuck in Troy.

591
00:35:37,113 --> 00:35:37,914
Okay.

592
00:35:37,947 --> 00:35:41,650
I need your help.
Trojan Suitcase.

593
00:35:42,584 --> 00:35:43,618
What?

594
00:35:43,652 --> 00:35:46,521
Read your handbook, Chapter
13. I'm in room 1312.

595
00:35:49,658 --> 00:35:50,525
Thank you.

596
00:36:02,104 --> 00:36:03,306
Shit.

597
00:36:03,338 --> 00:36:05,808
You know, for the first time
ever, I can finally taste life.

598
00:36:06,843 --> 00:36:08,144
Hey.

599
00:36:08,177 --> 00:36:09,879
- Hi.
- You guys all right?

600
00:36:09,912 --> 00:36:14,016
More than all right. Gunther
said I had what it takes.

601
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,483
To do what?

602
00:36:15,517 --> 00:36:17,053
I'll find out tonight.

603
00:36:18,821 --> 00:36:19,621
What about you?

604
00:36:19,654 --> 00:36:20,823
Did you know that 75% of humans
beings

605
00:36:20,857 --> 00:36:23,658
don't know the difference
between ratios and percentages?

606
00:36:23,693 --> 00:36:24,827
I don't see how
that's important.

607
00:36:24,861 --> 00:36:29,932
If you came tonight, you would
know why it is important.

608
00:36:29,966 --> 00:36:30,833
Ah.

609
00:36:32,367 --> 00:36:35,104
Did you know 100% of people who pay
for things impulsively are dum-dums?

610
00:36:35,137 --> 00:36:37,139
Did you know that I 100%
believe in you?

611
00:36:54,924 --> 00:36:55,791
Excuse me.

612
00:36:59,028 --> 00:37:01,931
- B.I.T.
- Damn!

613
00:37:21,951 --> 00:37:24,020
- What took you so long?
- I couldn't find Kevin.

614
00:37:24,053 --> 00:37:28,925
Kevin is where Kevin always is,
next to Anteaus, Artmeis, and Leroy.

615
00:37:28,958 --> 00:37:32,728
I found him eventually, but then Leroy made me
answer three riddles. It was a whole thing.

616
00:37:32,762 --> 00:37:35,164
Hey, that's Leroy's job.

617
00:37:35,197 --> 00:37:36,899
Why are you wearing a bikini?

618
00:37:36,933 --> 00:37:39,601
Because I don't have my clothes

619
00:37:39,634 --> 00:37:43,505
and for some reason there are
no robes in this room.

620
00:37:44,606 --> 00:37:46,943
But why are you wearing the top?

621
00:37:46,976 --> 00:37:48,077
It's spring.

622
00:37:49,078 --> 00:37:50,179
What's going on in there?

623
00:37:50,212 --> 00:37:54,817
Nothing. Well, I was trying to
hook up with this girl.

624
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,152
It was going really well, right.

625
00:37:56,185 --> 00:37:58,020
She was giving me like all the
signs, you know,

626
00:37:58,054 --> 00:38:00,189
and then she was like,
"Yeah." And I was like, "What?"

627
00:38:00,222 --> 00:38:02,191
I was like, "Yeah."
And she was like, "No."

628
00:38:02,224 --> 00:38:03,960
I went, "What? Because you
just said yeah."

629
00:38:03,993 --> 00:38:05,962
Anyway, hashtag respect,
so I hung out here.

630
00:38:05,995 --> 00:38:08,097
And I realized I left my
clothes in there and I was like,

631
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,199
"I'll come out because
there's probably robes here."

632
00:38:10,232 --> 00:38:13,568
But there were no robes
in this room.

633
00:38:17,773 --> 00:38:19,108
It's one of those
Spirifresh girls?

634
00:38:21,277 --> 00:38:22,945
I don't know where she works.

635
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:25,948
But I'm guessing it's probably
one of those Spirifresh girls.

636
00:38:27,917 --> 00:38:29,517
Okay, hop in. Let's
get you out of here.

637
00:38:29,551 --> 00:38:31,854
Woah, woah, woah. Back up.

638
00:38:32,321 --> 00:38:33,923
This isn't my first rodeo.

639
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:38,127
If only I hadn't pulled slime in
the real <i>Ghostbusters </i>,

640
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,229
I wouldn't be going into another
Trojan suitcase.

641
00:38:45,034 --> 00:38:47,103
- Hi, Alan.
- Joshua.

642
00:38:47,136 --> 00:38:49,105
You can just call me Josh.

643
00:38:49,138 --> 00:38:50,873
That's what I said. Joshua.

644
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:53,209
What's with the robes?

645
00:38:53,242 --> 00:38:55,845
I'm removing them from all the rooms until
we find out who's been stealing them.

646
00:38:55,878 --> 00:38:57,847
What was that?

647
00:38:58,881 --> 00:38:59,782
I sneezed.

648
00:38:59,815 --> 00:39:01,117
It sounded muffled.

649
00:39:01,917 --> 00:39:03,219
My sneezes are muffled.

650
00:39:03,252 --> 00:39:04,286
Why?

651
00:39:06,654 --> 00:39:09,792
Deviated nose job.

652
00:39:10,292 --> 00:39:11,293
Hmm.

653
00:39:20,736 --> 00:39:22,138
- Oh.
- Ah!

654
00:39:22,171 --> 00:39:25,640
Oh, hi! Here. Okay.

655
00:39:26,876 --> 00:39:28,576
I'll take that, sir.

656
00:39:31,313 --> 00:39:34,884
Okay. Oh, you're gonna take that
for me. Thank you so much.

657
00:39:35,384 --> 00:39:37,086
Is there anything else
we can do for you?

658
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,088
No, I'm actually off to see the
concierge.

659
00:39:39,121 --> 00:39:43,059
I was going to arrange a tour of
your local lettuce facilities.

660
00:39:43,092 --> 00:39:44,693
Excellent choice.

661
00:39:44,727 --> 00:39:47,830
Yes. I will see you later.

662
00:39:54,904 --> 00:39:57,840
Okay, okay. Enjoy.

663
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,015
Joshua.

664
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:09,919
I think this is going
to have a profound impact.

665
00:40:09,952 --> 00:40:12,054
You got to be kidding me.
What the hell is this?

666
00:40:12,088 --> 00:40:13,989
We wanted to give our guests a
chance to join

667
00:40:14,023 --> 00:40:16,658
just in case they're yet not aware
of the wonders of Spirifresh.

668
00:40:16,692 --> 00:40:18,360
Gunther says we'll get
a cut of each one sold.

669
00:40:18,394 --> 00:40:19,962
You mean like a pyramid scheme?

670
00:40:19,995 --> 00:40:22,832
Not cash, my gentle warrior. A
percentage of our soul.

671
00:40:22,865 --> 00:40:23,833
That's much less crazy.

672
00:40:25,768 --> 00:40:28,170
- Josh, what the shit is this?
- Trojan Suitcase.

673
00:40:28,204 --> 00:40:30,339
I can see that. What are
you doing with it?

674
00:40:30,372 --> 00:40:32,708
Did you authorize a B.I.T. to
execute a Trojan, yes?

675
00:40:32,741 --> 00:40:35,044
Shut your mouth. I did not.
I'm just learning of this.

676
00:40:35,077 --> 00:40:36,879
It has to be approved by a bell
captain.

677
00:40:36,912 --> 00:40:38,781
I would never have allowed it.
Too much risk.

678
00:40:38,814 --> 00:40:40,216
I'm sorry, Steve.
No one was around.

679
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:44,652
Josh, will you get me out
of here so I can meet Tony Danza?

680
00:40:44,687 --> 00:40:46,922
Just get Brad to safety so he
can change.

681
00:40:46,956 --> 00:40:48,991
It's almost time for afternoon
check-ins.

682
00:40:50,993 --> 00:40:52,194
Faster, Josh.

683
00:40:52,228 --> 00:40:54,763
- I'm trying.
- You move so weird.

684
00:40:56,198 --> 00:40:59,435
- You guys are really in deep...
- Hello, Steven. Have you seen Joshua?

685
00:40:59,468 --> 00:41:00,903
I have some items I
need to discuss with him.

686
00:41:00,936 --> 00:41:05,808
Alan, you know what? Josh just went on
break. Anything I can help you with?

687
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:08,177
Currently no. It's
Joshua I need.

688
00:41:09,245 --> 00:41:10,846
Revised check-in list is here.

689
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,047
Thank you so much, Stacey.

690
00:41:13,682 --> 00:41:17,086
Alan, we really need to attend to our bell
duties. Priorities, you understand that?

691
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,089
Maybe we can reconvene
in an hour or so?

692
00:41:20,122 --> 00:41:23,025
Yes, of course. As you were.

693
00:41:35,771 --> 00:41:38,807
Oh, thank God! I could barely
breathe in there.

694
00:41:38,841 --> 00:41:41,210
I'm sorry about that, Brad.
Where are the extra uniforms?

695
00:41:45,281 --> 00:41:48,851
Wait, why didn't you just have
me bring you a uniform?

696
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:50,419
- Because it's spring.
- Yeah.

697
00:41:51,253 --> 00:41:52,721
Here you go.

698
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:55,791
Hey, Josh.

699
00:41:57,226 --> 00:41:58,827
You killed it today.

700
00:42:05,501 --> 00:42:06,802
What?

701
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:08,971
I like it.

702
00:42:10,339 --> 00:42:14,243
Me too, Leroy. Me too.

703
00:42:14,276 --> 00:42:16,278
- <i>Come on down, Kelly.</i>
- No, Patty. Patty.

704
00:42:16,312 --> 00:42:18,814
- <i>Don't think...</i>
- Patty, I need you to take this seriously.

705
00:42:18,847 --> 00:42:20,316
- <i>Shut up.</i>
- Bye.

706
00:42:20,349 --> 00:42:21,483
- Hello!
- Oh!

707
00:42:22,952 --> 00:42:23,886
Hello.

708
00:42:25,487 --> 00:42:28,757
- Go ahead.
- Okay. Can I help you?

709
00:42:29,892 --> 00:42:31,427
What even is this?

710
00:42:32,494 --> 00:42:33,929
Help.

711
00:42:33,963 --> 00:42:35,764
What is help?

712
00:42:35,798 --> 00:42:40,369
I have noticed something
about you when we met before.

713
00:42:40,402 --> 00:42:42,071
I'm sorry, we met before?

714
00:42:42,104 --> 00:42:43,339
It was not in this life.

715
00:42:43,372 --> 00:42:47,176
It was on another planet called
Maple First.

716
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:50,346
It looks exactly like
Earth. You can't even tell.

717
00:42:50,379 --> 00:42:52,348
It's the same carpet on the
wall, everything.

718
00:42:52,381 --> 00:42:54,883
But it does not have
the restraints

719
00:42:54,917 --> 00:42:58,554
of man and woman.

720
00:43:04,927 --> 00:43:07,463
Is there something I
can help you with?

721
00:43:07,496 --> 00:43:09,498
It's clear you have questions.

722
00:43:09,531 --> 00:43:12,101
I clearly have answers.

723
00:43:12,601 --> 00:43:14,403
Do you
feel my foot on your foot?

724
00:43:14,436 --> 00:43:15,604
That's not me.

725
00:43:15,638 --> 00:43:18,107
There's something under the
table that feels like a foot.

726
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,009
Kelly, look.

727
00:43:20,943 --> 00:43:23,946
You need to come tonight.

728
00:43:25,481 --> 00:43:27,349
I'm not sure that I can.

729
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,121
What's fun to do in the area?

730
00:43:33,455 --> 00:43:34,623
Would you like a brochure?

731
00:43:34,657 --> 00:43:39,228
Yeah, yeah. For sure, yeah.
This is kind of why I came.

732
00:43:48,971 --> 00:43:51,373
All right, kid. You
ready for check-ins?

733
00:43:53,409 --> 00:43:54,510
I was born...

734
00:43:56,378 --> 00:43:57,246
Ready.

735
00:43:58,782 --> 00:44:01,150
I think he was going to say, "I was
born ready." But I think I punched him.

736
00:44:03,285 --> 00:44:06,221
Congratulations, your future
husband is a very lucky man.

737
00:44:07,122 --> 00:44:09,491
I'm not going to cheat
on him with you.

738
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:12,628
Oh, no, no, no, no. I... I didn't
mean that. I have a girlfriend.

739
00:44:12,661 --> 00:44:15,998
So, I'm... I'm happy there in
that capacity.

740
00:44:16,031 --> 00:44:17,433
You don't think I'm pretty?

741
00:44:20,669 --> 00:44:24,039
I don't want to go
inside the hotel.

742
00:44:24,073 --> 00:44:26,075
Pick a card, any card.

743
00:44:26,108 --> 00:44:27,609
But that's a bird.

744
00:44:27,643 --> 00:44:29,178
Magic.

745
00:44:39,254 --> 00:44:41,090
- We want ice-cream.
- We want ice-cream.

746
00:44:41,123 --> 00:44:42,624
- We want ice-cream.
- We want ice-cream.

747
00:44:42,658 --> 00:44:44,226
- We want ice-cream.
- We want ice-cream.

748
00:44:44,259 --> 00:44:47,429
I don't usually do this, but I'm going
to give you some free financial advice.

749
00:44:47,463 --> 00:44:49,131
Oh, yeah. Apple, Amazon?

750
00:44:49,164 --> 00:44:52,034
No, that's the past. You want
to buy polyurethane.

751
00:44:52,067 --> 00:44:53,202
Like plastics?

752
00:44:53,235 --> 00:44:55,304
No, like sex dolls. We all
need them.

753
00:44:57,439 --> 00:44:59,108
Or Wahlburgers.

754
00:45:01,176 --> 00:45:03,145
Sir, I'm gonna help you
with that. Toss me that.

755
00:45:11,153 --> 00:45:12,521
Hey, get back here.

756
00:45:21,397 --> 00:45:22,498
<i>Bravo!</i>

757
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,268
Check-in's this way.

758
00:45:39,148 --> 00:45:40,082
Josh.

759
00:45:41,583 --> 00:45:44,353
You engaged in a Trojan suitcase
without approval of your bell captain.

760
00:45:44,386 --> 00:45:46,488
But due to the circumstances,

761
00:45:46,522 --> 00:45:48,257
I will approve it
postquam factum.

762
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:50,693
Congratulations, you've passed
the second stage.

763
00:45:51,694 --> 00:45:54,163
Hey, hey. Congrats on passing
stage two, Josh.

764
00:45:54,196 --> 00:45:55,698
Aw, thanks guys.

765
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:00,068
Dude, this is for the Brennan's
birthday party.

766
00:46:04,473 --> 00:46:06,275
I'm sorry.

767
00:46:06,308 --> 00:46:07,976
Those are Make-a-Wish kids.

768
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:10,412
They had one wish. Cake.

769
00:46:29,565 --> 00:46:30,499
What now?

770
00:46:30,532 --> 00:46:32,134
I need to be at that dinner
with Whitman.

771
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:33,770
- Why?
- Because I lied to Kelly again.

772
00:46:33,803 --> 00:46:35,204
What? Why would you...

773
00:46:36,472 --> 00:46:38,307
You're really putting me in a
bad spot here.

774
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,509
- Mr. Whitman's going to be here any minute.
- Yeah, I know.

775
00:46:41,376 --> 00:46:43,979
I will talk to Susan. Stop
lying to people!

776
00:46:48,685 --> 00:46:50,118
We can party in my
yacht tomorrow.

777
00:46:53,155 --> 00:46:54,323
Here he comes.

778
00:46:55,157 --> 00:46:56,191
Steve, hey Steve.

779
00:46:56,225 --> 00:46:58,327
We crushed this afternoon rush
and we were thinking,

780
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,429
can we clock out
early for Spirifresh?

781
00:47:00,462 --> 00:47:01,731
Are you sure you want to?
He's...

782
00:47:01,764 --> 00:47:04,099
<i>I've
never been more sure in my life.</i>

783
00:47:04,132 --> 00:47:06,435
Let me go talk to Brad
for a minute. Cool?

784
00:47:06,468 --> 00:47:08,504
- Yeah. Cool. Awesome.
- Thank you. Steve, thank you.

785
00:47:08,537 --> 00:47:09,404
Not here.

786
00:47:26,789 --> 00:47:27,656
Hey, man.

787
00:47:29,091 --> 00:47:30,092
Thanks for coming.

788
00:47:31,093 --> 00:47:32,094
I need to come clean.

789
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:34,663
And I trust you.

790
00:47:36,431 --> 00:47:37,767
I'm trying to get a promotion.

791
00:47:39,535 --> 00:47:41,436
I know. I don't like
it happening this way,

792
00:47:42,604 --> 00:47:44,306
but it's my only shot of getting
Kelly back.

793
00:47:44,841 --> 00:47:49,111
Have you tried like telling her
how you feel? Being honest?

794
00:47:49,144 --> 00:47:51,613
Wow. What is it, 1958?

795
00:47:52,414 --> 00:47:56,652
Look, this is what's happening,
and I just need your support.

796
00:47:56,686 --> 00:47:57,553
It's fine, Steve.

797
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:59,856
It's your life.
You call the shots.

798
00:47:59,889 --> 00:48:03,258
We're just the bellmen helping bring
bags to the little hotel in your brain.

799
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,660
That's not true.

800
00:48:06,495 --> 00:48:07,797
You guys are
more than just bellmen.

801
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:08,698
Hey!

802
00:48:09,699 --> 00:48:10,666
So are you!

803
00:48:11,868 --> 00:48:13,602
If you think getting promoted
will help you get the girl,

804
00:48:14,837 --> 00:48:16,371
then you go for it.

805
00:48:17,205 --> 00:48:19,274
Whatever you do, just know
that we have your back.

806
00:48:20,142 --> 00:48:22,177
Just make sure it's the right
decision.

807
00:48:24,346 --> 00:48:25,247
Thank you, brother.

808
00:48:25,748 --> 00:48:28,751
Thank you for being honest.

809
00:48:28,785 --> 00:48:29,752
Yeah.

810
00:48:39,261 --> 00:48:41,463
I'm gonna go check on JJ and
Tyler. I'm worried about them.

811
00:48:41,496 --> 00:48:43,165
Yeah, I got to finish up here.

812
00:48:43,198 --> 00:48:45,367
- We both got stuff to do.
- Yeah, all right. All right.

813
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,836
- See you back at the...
- At the hotel.

814
00:48:46,869 --> 00:48:47,770
- Where we work.
- Yeah.

815
00:48:47,804 --> 00:48:49,806
If not, I'll text you
later. Same number?

816
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:51,273
- Good to see you, Brad.
- You too.

817
00:48:51,306 --> 00:48:52,809
Lot of sun screen. I like that.

818
00:48:58,513 --> 00:48:59,816
Oh, you like that?

819
00:49:05,888 --> 00:49:08,590
- Can you untie me now?
- Did you learn your lesson?

820
00:49:08,624 --> 00:49:11,460
- Yeah.
- You're going to do a Trojan ass without an official A?

821
00:49:11,493 --> 00:49:15,530
Yeah. No. No. No. God, no. Absolutely not.
I've learned. I've learned.

822
00:49:16,264 --> 00:49:17,132
Good.

823
00:49:21,804 --> 00:49:22,671
Brad.

824
00:49:23,672 --> 00:49:24,841
Brad. Are you gonna untie me?

825
00:49:26,408 --> 00:49:27,275
Brad.

826
00:49:28,745 --> 00:49:32,147
Um, hello?

827
00:49:32,648 --> 00:49:35,217
Guys. Hey, guys?

828
00:49:37,586 --> 00:49:38,420
Guys.

829
00:49:38,453 --> 00:49:40,757
Okay, I'm only going
to do this once,

830
00:49:41,423 --> 00:49:42,725
because right now my
consciousness

831
00:49:42,759 --> 00:49:44,727
is being violently penetrated by
wisdom genitals.

832
00:49:45,527 --> 00:49:47,930
Okay. Well, I'm heading out.

833
00:49:47,964 --> 00:49:51,533
Just wanted to let you know
Mr. Whitman is arriving soon.

834
00:49:51,566 --> 00:49:54,469
Susan asked to make sure someone
was there to greet him.

835
00:49:54,503 --> 00:49:59,207
Well, I think Mr. Whitman needs to greet
himself first, if you know what mean.

836
00:50:00,409 --> 00:50:01,978
Just don't piss him off.

837
00:50:02,011 --> 00:50:03,880
Or Susan, I guess.

838
00:50:03,913 --> 00:50:05,580
Whatever. You
guys are weird.

839
00:50:07,382 --> 00:50:09,752
- <i>Adios</i>, Santiago.
- <i>Adios,</i> Stacey. Have a wonderful evening.

840
00:50:09,786 --> 00:50:11,253
Goodnight, Stacey.

841
00:50:11,286 --> 00:50:13,388
Steven. I need to speak to you.

842
00:50:13,422 --> 00:50:15,590
Ah, what's up Alan?

843
00:50:15,624 --> 00:50:18,460
I examined the employee log in
human resources

844
00:50:18,493 --> 00:50:21,630
and there's no information about
your pending promotion.

845
00:50:21,663 --> 00:50:23,066
Oh, yeah.

846
00:50:23,099 --> 00:50:26,234
It happened super last minute, so,
probably hasn't been updated yet.

847
00:50:26,869 --> 00:50:32,674
I checked with payroll and there's no start
paperwork submitted for the wage increase.

848
00:50:32,709 --> 00:50:34,744
I actually agreed to maintain my
bellman rate

849
00:50:34,777 --> 00:50:37,880
until I have sufficiently trained
our newest bellman hire, Josh.

850
00:50:37,914 --> 00:50:42,317
- Whom you've met.
- Yes, Joshua, met I have.

851
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:43,152
Great.

852
00:50:43,186 --> 00:50:46,321
But there's a different
insurance

853
00:50:46,354 --> 00:50:47,656
which covers management

854
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:52,829
and the paperwork for that
hasn't been submitted yet either.

855
00:50:52,862 --> 00:50:54,329
Well, yes.

856
00:50:54,362 --> 00:50:59,601
That's because since we've employed
the new cashless tipping app, Bravo,

857
00:51:00,302 --> 00:51:04,406
we also implemented a new
paperless paper app

858
00:51:05,407 --> 00:51:08,343
called Paper.

859
00:51:08,376 --> 00:51:09,812
That can't be,

860
00:51:09,846 --> 00:51:13,015
I would know if there was some new
app that we were supposed to have...

861
00:51:13,049 --> 00:51:16,953
It's brand new, super new.
Literally just happened.

862
00:51:16,986 --> 00:51:19,421
Like we
guys were talking about it.

863
00:51:19,454 --> 00:51:20,823
It's getting launched.

864
00:51:20,857 --> 00:51:23,525
I just got a text about it in
the old palm pilot.

865
00:51:23,558 --> 00:51:25,795
So, you know, so that's that.

866
00:51:25,828 --> 00:51:27,196
You know what, Alan?

867
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:30,900
This seems like there's still a lot
of information to be picked up on.

868
00:51:30,933 --> 00:51:32,702
So, I'm gonna talk...

869
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:36,438
I'm going to go find... to Brad
about...

870
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:38,573
What would Brad know?
He's just a common bellman.

871
00:51:38,607 --> 00:51:40,642
- Oh, wow.
- Alan, how dare you?

872
00:51:40,676 --> 00:51:43,445
- I'm right here.
- Brad is one of our top employees,

873
00:51:43,478 --> 00:51:45,715
and actually probably in line
to replace me as bell captain.

874
00:51:45,748 --> 00:51:48,316
- Really?
- You know what? Yeah, I think so.

875
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:49,618
When my promotion is
complete.

876
00:51:49,651 --> 00:51:52,722
- Congratulations again on your promotion.
- Thank you so much.

877
00:51:52,755 --> 00:51:54,891
I'm going to go talk to Susan.

878
00:51:54,924 --> 00:51:56,692
Great. Tell her I said hi.

879
00:51:56,726 --> 00:51:57,994
Tell her we said what up.

880
00:52:00,428 --> 00:52:03,565
I'm sorry, I got stuck, all
right. These guys are worthless.

881
00:52:03,598 --> 00:52:08,971
Worth is only measured less by the man who
values less worth than what he's actually worth.

882
00:52:09,005 --> 00:52:14,744
Thus, worthlessness cannot be worth
less than what it is, worthless.

883
00:52:16,946 --> 00:52:19,715
Okay. If Alan talks to Susan,
he's going to know there's no promotion.

884
00:52:19,749 --> 00:52:20,817
And we're gonna be screwed.

885
00:52:24,987 --> 00:52:26,454
What are you doing?

886
00:52:26,488 --> 00:52:28,891
<i>This is Ops, for Alan.</i>

887
00:52:30,425 --> 00:52:32,128
Okay, go for Alan.

888
00:52:32,161 --> 00:52:33,528
Hey, man.

889
00:52:33,562 --> 00:52:37,599
We have an emergency situation on
our hands and I need help, ASAP.

890
00:52:37,632 --> 00:52:39,969
One of the guests is...

891
00:52:42,038 --> 00:52:45,007
...molesting a saguaro.

892
00:52:45,975 --> 00:52:46,909
What?

893
00:52:46,943 --> 00:52:49,477
Yeah, man. We need a manager to
go down there

894
00:52:49,511 --> 00:52:53,015
and sort of oversee the
proceedings, and you know.

895
00:52:53,916 --> 00:52:55,650
Can't Michael handle it?

896
00:52:55,685 --> 00:52:59,454
Are you kidding me, man? Michael
is decapitated.

897
00:52:59,487 --> 00:53:00,488
What about Steven?

898
00:53:00,522 --> 00:53:04,026
Steven! Are you kidding me? That
guy is a boner.

899
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:06,494
I can't have a
boner go down there.

900
00:53:06,528 --> 00:53:08,965
Are you not listening to me?
Is this thing on?

901
00:53:08,998 --> 00:53:11,934
I need you and your big balls.

902
00:53:12,902 --> 00:53:13,803
Come again?

903
00:53:13,836 --> 00:53:15,503
Smart calls.

904
00:53:17,639 --> 00:53:20,076
Okay, I understand.

905
00:53:20,109 --> 00:53:21,811
<i>Where do you need me?</i>

906
00:53:23,846 --> 00:53:24,814
- What...
- Say something.

907
00:53:24,847 --> 00:53:28,617
- What?
- Where is the saguaro being molested?

908
00:53:30,019 --> 00:53:31,721
Twelfth hole, pal.

909
00:53:33,856 --> 00:53:35,423
The golf course?

910
00:53:35,457 --> 00:53:40,029
Yes, the golf course. What other holes do
we have around here? Don't answer that.

911
00:53:40,062 --> 00:53:43,866
Okay, copy that. I'm on my way.

912
00:54:01,784 --> 00:54:04,153
It's the boss. Ha-ha,
you're finally here.

913
00:54:04,186 --> 00:54:05,721
Tigron, how are you?

914
00:54:05,755 --> 00:54:09,091
Very good. Very good. Don't worry.
We will take very good care of your car.

915
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:11,559
Tigron, this isn't just a car.

916
00:54:12,161 --> 00:54:15,530
This is the most magnificent
thing I've ever put my ass in.

917
00:54:15,563 --> 00:54:18,500
If you ask it nicely, it'll make
coffee for you.

918
00:54:18,533 --> 00:54:21,070
Press drive, take a nap.
Go for a spin.

919
00:54:21,103 --> 00:54:24,040
This thing is so smart, it could
raise my children if I asked it to.

920
00:54:24,073 --> 00:54:27,143
I have extra baby just so
vehicle can raise it.

921
00:54:28,144 --> 00:54:29,511
How's your brother, Davit?

922
00:54:29,544 --> 00:54:32,580
I am excellent, sir,
just excellent.

923
00:54:32,614 --> 00:54:35,718
Ah, Davit. Good to see you. All
right, let me see.

924
00:54:36,118 --> 00:54:37,787
That's 25 bucks for you.

925
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:40,022
- Thank you.
- 25 dollars for you.

926
00:54:40,056 --> 00:54:42,858
And do me a favor,
take it easy on the bellmen, would you?

927
00:54:44,659 --> 00:54:46,561
I'd rather have
khachkar melt my balls.

928
00:54:47,662 --> 00:54:49,564
I understand. Take care, boys.

929
00:54:51,067 --> 00:54:52,201
Davit, get in the car.

930
00:54:56,138 --> 00:54:57,340
Hello...

931
00:54:57,373 --> 00:54:59,842
Susan, there's something urgent
I need to discuss with you.

932
00:54:59,875 --> 00:55:01,077
Not urgent. Sid now. Sid now.

933
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:04,814
Hey, there they are! The best
management team in the business.

934
00:55:04,847 --> 00:55:09,852
How are you guys? Oh, I've been
away for so long I missed you guys.

935
00:55:09,885 --> 00:55:10,987
Welcome back, Sid.

936
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:13,889
- Where's Alan?
- He's probably held up with a guest.

937
00:55:13,923 --> 00:55:15,590
- Okay.
- Mr. Whitman.

938
00:55:15,623 --> 00:55:18,560
Really? You insult me like this?

939
00:55:18,593 --> 00:55:21,529
How many times have I told you?
You don't call me Mr. Whitman.

940
00:55:21,563 --> 00:55:24,566
You call me Sid. You understand
me? Call me Sid.

941
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:26,235
- Yes, Mr. Whitman.
- Much better.

942
00:55:26,268 --> 00:55:28,237
- Can I take your bag?
- No. It's mine.

943
00:55:32,274 --> 00:55:34,977
I don't know it crosses, it
crosses. Oh, you forgot.

944
00:55:35,011 --> 00:55:36,245
Good to see you, buddy.

945
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:48,791
Hello.

946
00:55:53,095 --> 00:55:54,130
You there.

947
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:55,965
Are you okay?

948
00:55:57,333 --> 00:55:59,702
Have you been attacked?

949
00:56:00,836 --> 00:56:02,071
Do you need an adult?

950
00:56:03,372 --> 00:56:05,307
Did you see the incident?

951
00:56:11,113 --> 00:56:12,948
Alan for Operations.

952
00:56:12,982 --> 00:56:14,150
<i>Go for Ops.</i>

953
00:56:14,183 --> 00:56:16,052
I'm at the 12th hole.

954
00:56:16,085 --> 00:56:17,153
Mazel tov.

955
00:56:18,054 --> 00:56:19,989
Where is the molested saguaro?

956
00:56:20,689 --> 00:56:22,091
<i>I'm not sure what you mean, sir.</i>

957
00:56:22,958 --> 00:56:26,328
You called me to tend to the
12th hole

958
00:56:26,362 --> 00:56:29,865
to diffuse a situation involving
a molested saguaro.

959
00:56:29,899 --> 00:56:33,668
<i>You weren't called by us, sir.</i>

960
00:56:34,669 --> 00:56:36,604
<i>Yo, they got Alan again!</i>

961
00:56:38,374 --> 00:56:39,607
Steven.

962
00:56:40,876 --> 00:56:42,044
Two demerits.

963
00:56:46,715 --> 00:56:48,751
Dinner is ready whenever
you'd like to eat.

964
00:56:48,784 --> 00:56:50,386
- Fantastic.
- Steve will join us as well.

965
00:56:50,419 --> 00:56:52,121
Oh. Well, why?

966
00:56:52,154 --> 00:56:55,758
I... I told him he could.
Plus, he's very hungry.

967
00:56:55,791 --> 00:56:58,861
- Hello, Mr. Whitman.
- The next person that calls me Mr. Whitman is out of here.

968
00:56:58,894 --> 00:57:00,628
I'm very sorry, Mrs. Whitman.

969
00:57:00,662 --> 00:57:01,363
Very good.

970
00:57:01,397 --> 00:57:02,898
That I like. Come here.

971
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:07,336
Ah, it's good to see you.
And congratulations on that pin thingy.

972
00:57:07,369 --> 00:57:08,704
Thank you.

973
00:57:09,238 --> 00:57:10,439
- Let's eat.
- Yes.

974
00:57:10,473 --> 00:57:14,009
You know what, I'm going to
catch up with you guys in a bit.

975
00:57:14,043 --> 00:57:15,811
I got a few things to finish up
here, first.

976
00:57:15,845 --> 00:57:17,213
All right, let's go.

977
00:57:17,246 --> 00:57:18,347
Come on.

978
00:57:25,688 --> 00:57:27,056
I feel so joyous.

979
00:57:27,089 --> 00:57:28,157
Yes, yes.

980
00:57:31,127 --> 00:57:32,261
We're attending the conference.

981
00:57:32,294 --> 00:57:34,930
Gonna mess around and
change our lives completely.

982
00:57:34,964 --> 00:57:36,365
You guys did well today.

983
00:57:36,398 --> 00:57:38,400
No, we hit the ATM.

984
00:57:38,434 --> 00:57:42,004
Gunther likes to challenge his
disciples in the crowd

985
00:57:42,037 --> 00:57:45,407
and if you can outbid your neighbor
then you'll get a clue to the universe.

986
00:57:45,441 --> 00:57:47,343
Come, brother JJ, to
the conference

987
00:57:47,376 --> 00:57:51,013
and we will suckle from the tit of
perfection and life wondering wisdom.

988
00:57:51,046 --> 00:57:53,015
<i>Namaste.</i>
Now, I'm gonna go. You stay.

989
00:58:01,023 --> 00:58:02,391
How did you get free?

990
00:58:02,424 --> 00:58:03,993
Honestly, I don't know.

991
00:58:05,628 --> 00:58:10,299
I passed out from what I assume was lack
of blood circulation and dehydration. Both.

992
00:58:10,332 --> 00:58:12,234
I came to and I was free.

993
00:58:12,268 --> 00:58:15,471
I did see a big Native American
dude walking away.

994
00:58:15,504 --> 00:58:17,806
I tried calling out, but
everyone around here

995
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:20,743
likes to dramatically walk away and not
answer when people call out to them.

996
00:58:22,311 --> 00:58:23,913
Wait, Brad.

997
00:58:24,747 --> 00:58:25,414
Josh?

998
00:58:29,485 --> 00:58:31,954
Head to room 3158, pronto.

999
00:58:31,987 --> 00:58:33,022
I'm trusting you.

1000
00:58:33,756 --> 00:58:35,124
I'm sending
you to Gunther's room.

1001
00:58:35,157 --> 00:58:37,927
I need you to find something,
anything that will help us take him down.

1002
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,228
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

1003
00:58:41,163 --> 00:58:42,932
Wait, Steve.

1004
00:59:16,565 --> 00:59:18,934
Welcome to Spirifresh.

1005
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:27,843
And now, the closest thing we
have to a god on Earth,

1006
00:59:27,876 --> 00:59:30,512
the answer to all of our
problems,

1007
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:33,449
Gunther Gochamonet.

1008
01:00:11,987 --> 01:00:14,089
Why does the mind

1009
01:00:14,123 --> 01:00:18,327
always is trying to make the body
play hookey from your relevance?

1010
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:19,295
I'm on my journey,

1011
01:00:21,096 --> 01:00:23,332
I'm starting out this
way, yeah, but then I end up.

1012
01:00:29,271 --> 01:00:31,874
I end up over here.
Why am I hookey?

1013
01:00:31,907 --> 01:00:33,075
But tonight,

1014
01:00:34,877 --> 01:00:39,081
I will teach you.

1015
01:00:44,386 --> 01:00:46,355
If you're into a cherry
oak vibe,

1016
01:00:46,388 --> 01:00:49,124
with an after taste not
unlike a Russian winter,

1017
01:00:49,158 --> 01:00:51,560
- I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
- Wait, wait, wait.

1018
01:00:51,593 --> 01:00:52,594
This is the Malbec?

1019
01:00:52,628 --> 01:00:54,196
No, that's the tap water.

1020
01:00:54,229 --> 01:00:56,632
Never push the tap water, kid.

1021
01:00:56,665 --> 01:00:57,734
Of course.

1022
01:00:57,767 --> 01:01:01,503
If I may say, you are as
handsome as you are funny.

1023
01:01:01,537 --> 01:01:02,938
We only hire the finest.

1024
01:01:02,971 --> 01:01:04,940
Well, then how the hell
did Alan get a job?

1025
01:01:04,973 --> 01:01:07,142
Oh, Sid, he was a qualified
applicant.

1026
01:01:07,176 --> 01:01:10,279
I'm kidding. I love Alan. You
know what I'm going to have?

1027
01:01:10,312 --> 01:01:13,182
I'm going to have a Simmzy's
Beach Cruiser.

1028
01:01:13,215 --> 01:01:16,652
Oh, two Simmzy's Beach
Cruisers. One for my pal, Steve.

1029
01:01:16,686 --> 01:01:18,420
That is an excellent choice.

1030
01:01:18,454 --> 01:01:22,124
Now, on the specials menu tonight
we have a Cornish Game Hen,

1031
01:01:22,157 --> 01:01:26,528
Kentucky blue grass fed and raised with her
parents and half siblings in attendance.

1032
01:01:26,562 --> 01:01:29,565
She was given a community
college education,

1033
01:01:29,598 --> 01:01:31,467
but she spent her
winters at summer camp.

1034
01:01:34,036 --> 01:01:35,204
Everything okay?

1035
01:01:35,705 --> 01:01:38,974
Yeah, the Spirifresh thing is...

1036
01:01:39,541 --> 01:01:41,443
I'm just trying to make sure
everything's okay.

1037
01:01:41,477 --> 01:01:44,246
Well, I'm proud of you.

1038
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,615
Thank you. For what?

1039
01:01:46,648 --> 01:01:50,486
Well, taking the initiative to
move up.

1040
01:01:50,519 --> 01:01:52,321
It means a lot. It's a big deal.

1041
01:01:53,055 --> 01:01:56,158
Just knowing that getting a
promotion matters, means something.

1042
01:01:56,191 --> 01:01:57,359
It's half the battle.

1043
01:01:58,260 --> 01:01:59,128
Exactly.

1044
01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:04,199
You don't need to do.
You need to just try.

1045
01:02:04,233 --> 01:02:07,035
Get one shot. Lose myself in the
moment.

1046
01:02:07,069 --> 01:02:09,905
Take my mom's spaghetti.
Baby, I'm a firework.

1047
01:02:11,006 --> 01:02:12,941
Ain't
nobody gonna hold me down.

1048
01:02:12,975 --> 01:02:15,978
Oh,
oh, I got to keep on moving.

1049
01:02:16,011 --> 01:02:17,513
Backstreet's back all right.

1050
01:02:17,546 --> 01:02:19,081
Something like that.

1051
01:02:19,114 --> 01:02:20,516
We can talk
about it more after dinner.

1052
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:22,384
Maybe for a dirty one?

1053
01:02:23,686 --> 01:02:27,423
- I mean...
- You finished with your intimate moments? Proceed.

1054
01:02:27,456 --> 01:02:30,225
Thank you. I don't want you to
take my word for it.

1055
01:02:30,259 --> 01:02:34,196
When we say farm to table, we
mean farm to table.

1056
01:02:35,765 --> 01:02:37,566
Wait till you see how
fresh the fish is.

1057
01:02:39,201 --> 01:02:40,569
Okay, hold up. Hold up.

1058
01:02:40,602 --> 01:02:42,739
So, you
mean to tell me that she was hot

1059
01:02:42,772 --> 01:02:44,707
and then she wasn't hot and
then she was hot again?

1060
01:02:44,741 --> 01:02:48,277
- Bro, it's the method.
- I love chicks too.

1061
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:53,282
- I love pizza.
- Not as much as I love chicks. DKE.

1062
01:03:21,143 --> 01:03:23,145
<i>You are walking.</i>

1063
01:03:24,613 --> 01:03:25,748
You are walking on the cloud.

1064
01:03:26,582 --> 01:03:31,286
And the cloud looks up to you
and says,

1065
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:34,757
"Oh, hi. How's it going
up there? Yeah."

1066
01:03:35,758 --> 01:03:37,359
And you reply...

1067
01:03:37,392 --> 01:03:42,197
As long as I know who
I am, I am well.

1068
01:03:44,701 --> 01:03:45,567
Yeah,

1069
01:03:46,401 --> 01:03:47,269
yeah,

1070
01:03:48,103 --> 01:03:49,104
yeah,

1071
01:03:49,137 --> 01:03:50,005
yeah.

1072
01:03:52,307 --> 01:03:55,344
Using
your sense of ears like a bear.

1073
01:03:55,377 --> 01:03:58,614
With our minds
we begin to urinate

1074
01:03:59,314 --> 01:04:02,651
and then for real into
our pants.

1075
01:04:07,556 --> 01:04:10,592
We come to 18.
He hits an errand ball into the woods.

1076
01:04:10,626 --> 01:04:12,427
We can't find it. I said,
you know what?

1077
01:04:12,461 --> 01:04:15,130
Just drop a ball,
because I'm a good guy.

1078
01:04:15,163 --> 01:04:19,067
Hits a tree, bounces out of
bounds, I win the hole.

1079
01:04:19,101 --> 01:04:22,371
You know why?
Because I'm a good guy.

1080
01:04:22,404 --> 01:04:24,273
And I'm here today

1081
01:04:24,306 --> 01:04:29,344
because I'm a nice
guy with some very bad news.

1082
01:04:29,378 --> 01:04:31,113
I'm selling the hotel.

1083
01:04:32,581 --> 01:04:34,851
I was
approached by this big investor

1084
01:04:34,884 --> 01:04:37,754
who has an in with the Indian
Reservation and Gaming Board

1085
01:04:37,787 --> 01:04:40,522
and he wants to turn the place
into a casino and I...

1086
01:04:40,556 --> 01:04:43,425
I don't qualify for that.
And I love this place.

1087
01:04:43,458 --> 01:04:44,526
I love you guys,

1088
01:04:45,494 --> 01:04:47,396
but it's hard to keep this place
profitable,

1089
01:04:47,429 --> 01:04:49,766
and Samantha says she wants to
move to Florida.

1090
01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:53,635
And when the
wife says "jump," you say,

1091
01:04:54,636 --> 01:04:56,171
"Let's move to Florida."

1092
01:04:56,706 --> 01:04:58,340
But our jobs are safe, right?

1093
01:04:58,373 --> 01:05:00,609
See, this we don't know because
they're rebranding.

1094
01:05:00,642 --> 01:05:04,646
They're gonna turn the conference
rooms into gaming tables, and slots.

1095
01:05:04,681 --> 01:05:08,685
I don't know the details. I just
know that... Alan, you made it.

1096
01:05:08,718 --> 01:05:12,722
Yes, I did. But I'm not the only
one who made it to the top

1097
01:05:12,755 --> 01:05:14,891
of the ladder of lies.

1098
01:05:14,924 --> 01:05:16,158
Alan, you look like hell.

1099
01:05:16,191 --> 01:05:19,729
- Yeah, let's get you cleaned up.
- No, I'm not getting cleaned up.

1100
01:05:19,762 --> 01:05:24,232
- You all need to know what's...
- Steve! I'm so sorry to interrupt.

1101
01:05:24,266 --> 01:05:26,268
- Steve, I need to show you something.
- No!

1102
01:05:26,803 --> 01:05:30,339
It's my turn to talk. Steve
has been lying to me.

1103
01:05:30,372 --> 01:05:31,673
Lying to all of you.

1104
01:05:31,708 --> 01:05:36,244
He is not the Assistant Front
Office Manager.

1105
01:05:36,278 --> 01:05:38,848
He is a bell captain.
And that's it.

1106
01:05:38,881 --> 01:05:41,283
- What is he talking about?
- I don't know, Susan.

1107
01:05:41,316 --> 01:05:47,289
He has been impersonating a
manager, and that is a felony.

1108
01:05:47,322 --> 01:05:49,224
I don't think that's a felony.

1109
01:05:49,257 --> 01:05:50,425
Alan, you're very sweaty.

1110
01:05:50,459 --> 01:05:54,797
He led me to believe that he was
up for a very specific job

1111
01:05:54,831 --> 01:05:58,300
and then he was parading it all
around the hotel.

1112
01:05:58,333 --> 01:06:02,371
There are liability issues,
ethics issues.

1113
01:06:02,404 --> 01:06:03,873
He should be fired!

1114
01:06:03,906 --> 01:06:07,142
Okay, all right. All right. Just
hold on. Just calm down.

1115
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:09,879
Stop the music.

1116
01:06:11,513 --> 01:06:12,915
What the hell is
going on?

1117
01:06:12,949 --> 01:06:17,854
I have proof that Gunther is using
Sanz Hand, Sanz Hand, Sanz Hands

1118
01:06:17,887 --> 01:06:20,222
hand sanitizer
to brainwash his followers.

1119
01:06:20,255 --> 01:06:21,323
Let me see that.

1120
01:06:21,824 --> 01:06:23,558
You went into his room?

1121
01:06:24,426 --> 01:06:26,662
You broke into a guest's room?

1122
01:06:26,696 --> 01:06:27,897
I think that's a felony.

1123
01:06:27,930 --> 01:06:32,702
Well, yes but not because...

1124
01:06:32,735 --> 01:06:34,202
I told him to.

1125
01:06:35,705 --> 01:06:39,274
I was trying to prove that Gunther
is conning everyone with Spirifresh.

1126
01:06:39,307 --> 01:06:40,642
Who the hell is Gunther?

1127
01:06:43,946 --> 01:06:48,283
That's not Gunther, that's Chief Macanopy.
He's the guy who's buying the hotel from me.

1128
01:06:48,316 --> 01:06:50,318
Who's Chief Macanopy?

1129
01:06:50,352 --> 01:06:53,355
- This doesn't add up.
- You're selling the hotel?

1130
01:06:53,388 --> 01:06:55,557
- Yes.
- Will we get to keep our jobs?

1131
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:57,760
We don't know. They're rebranding.
We'll tell you later.

1132
01:06:57,794 --> 01:06:59,261
We got to get to
that conference.

1133
01:07:00,295 --> 01:07:01,263
Wait.

1134
01:07:02,965 --> 01:07:04,633
He has to be fired.

1135
01:07:05,333 --> 01:07:06,969
You should be fired.

1136
01:07:08,537 --> 01:07:10,740
He should be fired.

1137
01:07:10,773 --> 01:07:12,875
Your smoked tilapia.

1138
01:07:15,678 --> 01:07:17,747
- Enjoy.
- One demerit.

1139
01:07:27,389 --> 01:07:29,424
Put the money in the basket.

1140
01:07:29,992 --> 01:07:31,426
Mortgage your home.

1141
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:32,829
Mortgage your
children.

1142
01:07:32,862 --> 01:07:34,663
You got lovely
children.

1143
01:07:34,697 --> 01:07:35,698
My kind of guy.

1144
01:07:50,012 --> 01:07:51,013
Management.

1145
01:07:51,047 --> 01:07:52,447
Oh.

1146
01:07:52,481 --> 01:07:56,318
Wait, wait! He should be fired!

1147
01:07:56,351 --> 01:07:57,954
- Alan.
- Ah!

1148
01:08:10,465 --> 01:08:12,969
Oh my God. It's worse
than we thought.

1149
01:08:15,337 --> 01:08:18,007
We'll do anything, if you
give Gunther your money.

1150
01:08:24,346 --> 01:08:26,581
No, this is bad.

1151
01:08:27,415 --> 01:08:29,018
Stop. Stop!

1152
01:08:29,051 --> 01:08:31,486
Hey, stop it!

1153
01:08:33,622 --> 01:08:35,624
This man is a sham!

1154
01:08:35,657 --> 01:08:37,526
- Who is this guy?
- Sit down!

1155
01:08:37,559 --> 01:08:39,896
I know you all want to make your
lives better.

1156
01:08:39,929 --> 01:08:44,399
And I know you think this guy is
going to do that. But he's not.

1157
01:08:44,432 --> 01:08:45,701
Okay?

1158
01:08:46,434 --> 01:08:47,636
What has he done for you?

1159
01:08:48,104 --> 01:08:49,906
What
has he done for any of you?

1160
01:08:49,939 --> 01:08:53,075
What physical product has he
actually provided?

1161
01:08:53,109 --> 01:08:55,812
- Let's get him!
- Let's get him with some violence.

1162
01:08:55,845 --> 01:08:59,816
We don't rip him limb from limb. We do
not attack. We are peaceful people, yeah?

1163
01:09:00,783 --> 01:09:04,754
Steve, the physical product is

1164
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,589
the metaphysical being.

1165
01:09:09,926 --> 01:09:11,493
It's hard for him to learn.

1166
01:09:13,729 --> 01:09:17,365
What the hell does that mean?
What are you clapping for?

1167
01:09:18,034 --> 01:09:19,302
Yes.

1168
01:09:20,036 --> 01:09:21,503
Why are you crying, man?

1169
01:09:21,536 --> 01:09:23,806
Okay. Okay.

1170
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:26,709
Then what's with all the
Sanz Hands hand sanitizer?

1171
01:09:26,742 --> 01:09:27,642
What's it called?

1172
01:09:27,677 --> 01:09:29,745
Sanz Hands hand sanitizer.

1173
01:09:32,181 --> 01:09:33,850
I believe in clean hands, guys.

1174
01:09:36,853 --> 01:09:38,988
You can't just clap for
everything he says.

1175
01:09:39,956 --> 01:09:43,025
I'd like to clarify that. You can applaud
everything I say. It's no problem.

1176
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:46,963
Shh.

1177
01:09:49,966 --> 01:09:51,633
Okay, okay.

1178
01:09:53,135 --> 01:09:58,841
Well, Gunther, well, why do you have
a thousand bottles of this stuff?

1179
01:09:58,875 --> 01:10:01,476
- Ew, gross.
- Damn it, Josh.

1180
01:10:01,509 --> 01:10:03,045
OMG, that's hot.

1181
01:10:03,079 --> 01:10:05,815
- That right there, not appropriate.
- Come on.

1182
01:10:07,817 --> 01:10:09,051
Ah-ha! That!

1183
01:10:14,924 --> 01:10:18,895
I suffer from mysophobia,

1184
01:10:18,928 --> 01:10:20,863
which is a fear of germs.

1185
01:10:20,897 --> 01:10:24,100
One that is debilitating.

1186
01:10:24,133 --> 01:10:29,504
Then I read the teachings of Khatkhate
Baba who showed me the way of clean.

1187
01:10:29,537 --> 01:10:31,774
The way of the Sanz Hands
hand sanitizer

1188
01:10:31,807 --> 01:10:37,612
which also was leading me on the
path to Spirifresh.

1189
01:10:40,182 --> 01:10:43,618
Okay, if you buy in
bulk, like larger bottles,

1190
01:10:43,652 --> 01:10:45,520
you could probably save a lot of
money that way.

1191
01:10:52,828 --> 01:10:54,030
Just look at me, Josh.

1192
01:10:55,898 --> 01:10:57,099
It's like the Eskimo.

1193
01:10:57,900 --> 01:10:59,501
Like the Eskimos!

1194
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:03,605
Thank you, Josh. We love him.
We love you.

1195
01:11:05,141 --> 01:11:08,978
I love Josh. I love Josh.
I love him here too.

1196
01:11:09,011 --> 01:11:11,981
Okay, this is classic behavior.

1197
01:11:12,014 --> 01:11:14,616
This is called poor conductor,

1198
01:11:14,649 --> 01:11:16,852
because he sees
the choo-choo train,

1199
01:11:16,886 --> 01:11:21,023
a successful man is going and he
wants to derail this poor conductor.

1200
01:11:21,057 --> 01:11:23,059
I know.

1201
01:11:23,092 --> 01:11:25,828
What the hell is the
matter with you?

1202
01:11:26,628 --> 01:11:27,863
Boo this man.

1203
01:11:30,066 --> 01:11:32,001
- Boo. Shame!
- Oh yeah.

1204
01:11:32,835 --> 01:11:34,669
Shame!

1205
01:11:36,806 --> 01:11:40,109
You think this is about
me not being happy?

1206
01:11:41,643 --> 01:11:44,780
Let us ask Shteve. Say
it out loud, Shteve.

1207
01:11:44,814 --> 01:11:46,749
- Shteve.
- It's Steve.

1208
01:11:47,883 --> 01:11:50,252
Where were you 27
years ago, hmm?

1209
01:11:55,324 --> 01:11:57,559
I was training here
as a bellman.

1210
01:11:58,194 --> 01:12:00,896
Are you in a successful
relationship?

1211
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:03,232
Have you accomplished any of
your dreams?

1212
01:12:08,237 --> 01:12:10,806
Well Shteve, say it, Shteve.

1213
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:11,907
Shteve.

1214
01:12:11,941 --> 01:12:13,042
That's not my name.

1215
01:12:13,876 --> 01:12:17,046
What does your father think of
you, huh?

1216
01:12:20,615 --> 01:12:23,152
Okay, when you're
ready, we're here for you.

1217
01:12:23,185 --> 01:12:24,020
Happy birthday.

1218
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:27,289
Today could be the day
that you get born.

1219
01:12:27,323 --> 01:12:28,190
Yeah?

1220
01:12:29,225 --> 01:12:32,228
I'm going to give you a brochure
for Spirifresh.

1221
01:12:37,066 --> 01:12:37,933
Hmm.

1222
01:12:40,036 --> 01:12:45,975
Good, Shteve. Now, we have the new
perfect people here and let's get to it.

1223
01:12:50,679 --> 01:12:53,682
I... I don't know exactly what
you were trying to prove here,

1224
01:12:53,716 --> 01:12:57,787
but this... this... this is
unacceptable.

1225
01:12:57,820 --> 01:12:59,388
Chief Macanopy,
I got to tell you,

1226
01:12:59,422 --> 01:13:02,191
at the meeting I really prefer the
headdress and the feathers and everything,

1227
01:13:02,224 --> 01:13:05,061
but right now you look thinner,
you look great.

1228
01:13:05,094 --> 01:13:07,963
Oh, I love you. I love you.

1229
01:13:07,997 --> 01:13:09,298
You are fired.

1230
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:12,835
And you're
fired too, Joshua.

1231
01:13:37,827 --> 01:13:40,729
I was trying to save the
hotel and this is what... Ah!

1232
01:14:39,455 --> 01:14:40,322
<i>Hola </i>.

1233
01:14:41,490 --> 01:14:43,425
Is there a guy named
Steve here?

1234
01:14:46,462 --> 01:14:48,197
Oh, great.

1235
01:14:50,065 --> 01:14:52,201
Is there a <i>gringo </i>?

1236
01:15:02,278 --> 01:15:05,247
Okay, I'm
guessing Steve isn't here.

1237
01:15:05,881 --> 01:15:06,982
Good guess.

1238
01:15:10,019 --> 01:15:10,886
Steve.

1239
01:15:11,754 --> 01:15:13,756
The Steve you knew is long gone.

1240
01:15:13,789 --> 01:15:17,426
Around here my family calls me
" <i>idiota sin hogar</i> ."

1241
01:15:17,459 --> 01:15:19,395
Your family? It's only
been a couple of days.

1242
01:15:19,428 --> 01:15:21,230
Yeah, well we got close.

1243
01:15:29,939 --> 01:15:32,141
It's a little inside joke
with the <i>pueblo </i>.

1244
01:15:32,174 --> 01:15:33,976
You heard the
lady, I ain't leaving.

1245
01:15:34,777 --> 01:15:36,312
This is the new Steve, baby.

1246
01:15:40,549 --> 01:15:42,785
You know, donkeys can think for
themselves.

1247
01:15:42,818 --> 01:15:44,353
That's why they're
better than horses.

1248
01:15:44,386 --> 01:15:45,387
Here you go, buddy.

1249
01:15:46,522 --> 01:15:47,756
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

1250
01:15:47,790 --> 01:15:50,993
Remember when we used to eat out
of the palm of our own hands?

1251
01:15:51,026 --> 01:15:52,161
Psyche, we never did.

1252
01:15:52,928 --> 01:15:54,096
I don't miss you at all.

1253
01:15:55,030 --> 01:15:57,967
Steve...
Get out of my way, dude.

1254
01:16:00,302 --> 01:16:02,137
He's standing on my toes now.

1255
01:16:02,838 --> 01:16:03,772
Retreat.

1256
01:16:05,207 --> 01:16:06,141
Retreat.

1257
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:18,954
You need to eat something.

1258
01:16:22,958 --> 01:16:24,526
Steve, you can't give up, man.

1259
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:25,761
Why not?

1260
01:16:26,362 --> 01:16:27,329
I have nothing.

1261
01:16:28,497 --> 01:16:30,165
Absolutely nothing.

1262
01:16:30,199 --> 01:16:31,533
That's not true.

1263
01:16:31,567 --> 01:16:32,901
You know, I tried to end it all.

1264
01:16:34,069 --> 01:16:37,139
I bought a gun. I was going to
shoot myself in the face.

1265
01:16:37,172 --> 01:16:38,340
Steve.

1266
01:16:38,374 --> 01:16:40,376
A couple of priests convinced
me not to and stole my gun.

1267
01:16:42,411 --> 01:16:43,545
I think they were priests.

1268
01:16:43,579 --> 01:16:45,180
You got a lot to live for.

1269
01:16:45,214 --> 01:16:47,216
You got the job, the hotel.

1270
01:16:47,249 --> 01:16:50,286
After you left, Sid told Alan
everyone makes mistakes.

1271
01:16:51,053 --> 01:16:52,689
He was way out
of line for firing you.

1272
01:16:52,722 --> 01:16:56,058
Sid chased after you and tried to give you
your job back, but you were already gone.

1273
01:16:56,091 --> 01:16:57,493
Sid chased after me?

1274
01:16:58,861 --> 01:16:59,828
Good guy.

1275
01:17:00,963 --> 01:17:02,031
What about Kelly?

1276
01:17:02,998 --> 01:17:05,034
She seems more sad than anything
to be honest.

1277
01:17:05,067 --> 01:17:06,468
If you go back
and tell her the truth...

1278
01:17:06,502 --> 01:17:08,237
Oh, dude. She knows the truth.

1279
01:17:09,238 --> 01:17:11,373
What's the point? We're all
getting fired anyway.

1280
01:17:12,174 --> 01:17:13,375
Yeah, maybe.

1281
01:17:17,179 --> 01:17:18,514
Or maybe not.

1282
01:17:19,381 --> 01:17:22,251
I got an idea that can stop the
sale and keep our jobs,

1283
01:17:22,284 --> 01:17:24,553
but you got
to come back with me right now.

1284
01:17:30,192 --> 01:17:31,193
Look at me, I'm a mess.

1285
01:17:32,628 --> 01:17:35,497
Well, let's get you cleaned up,
brother, starting with some clothes.

1286
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:44,940
Do it for Steve.

1287
01:17:56,352 --> 01:17:58,087
Come on. Come on.

1288
01:17:58,120 --> 01:17:58,987
About time.

1289
01:18:00,055 --> 01:18:00,856
There we go.

1290
01:18:07,429 --> 01:18:09,598
Well, hello little lady,
couldn't help...

1291
01:18:09,631 --> 01:18:11,500
Turn off, turn off. Why? Why?

1292
01:18:18,574 --> 01:18:21,910
Dude, why are you punching meat?

1293
01:18:21,944 --> 01:18:25,581
You just need to go back, make some
apologies and fill out some paperwork.

1294
01:18:27,684 --> 01:18:30,185
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

1295
01:18:37,326 --> 01:18:39,561
I'll miss you most, carnicero.

1296
01:18:44,533 --> 01:18:46,068
For you family.

1297
01:19:00,182 --> 01:19:01,116
Hey, Josh.

1298
01:19:04,119 --> 01:19:04,987
Wow.

1299
01:19:05,554 --> 01:19:07,222
Look, I know I screwed up, man.

1300
01:19:07,256 --> 01:19:09,057
All right, you should've never
trusted me.

1301
01:19:09,658 --> 01:19:10,860
But for what it's worth,

1302
01:19:10,894 --> 01:19:13,362
I thought you always had what it
takes to make a great bellman.

1303
01:19:13,395 --> 01:19:15,130
Yeah, so?

1304
01:19:15,664 --> 01:19:18,667
I mean what's the
difference now? This is my life.

1305
01:19:18,701 --> 01:19:20,068
I want to make things right.

1306
01:19:21,303 --> 01:19:24,540
I want to get our jobs back, go
back to the way things were.

1307
01:19:24,573 --> 01:19:25,674
Why should I listen to you now?

1308
01:19:25,708 --> 01:19:29,278
I don't know, okay. I've been
through some shit, man.

1309
01:19:30,045 --> 01:19:31,714
Gained some serious perspective.

1310
01:19:32,548 --> 01:19:34,717
I moved to Mexico, befriended a
donkey...

1311
01:19:34,751 --> 01:19:37,286
Yeah, Steve, Steve. That's just
it. It's all about you.

1312
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:39,121
It's always all about you.

1313
01:19:39,154 --> 01:19:42,324
I mean, Steve is the quarterback
and the defense

1314
01:19:42,357 --> 01:19:44,460
and everybody else is
just cheerleaders.

1315
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:50,332
Steve is the all-beef patty, and we're
all just lettuce, tomato, onions.

1316
01:19:52,601 --> 01:19:56,472
Steve is the sun rotating
around all of us stupid planets.

1317
01:19:56,505 --> 01:19:59,541
You're right, I was only
thinking about what I wanted.

1318
01:20:01,276 --> 01:20:02,411
But it's not about me.

1319
01:20:02,444 --> 01:20:03,545
I get that now.

1320
01:20:03,579 --> 01:20:04,546
It's about us.

1321
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:06,114
It's about you guys.

1322
01:20:06,148 --> 01:20:07,684
It's about the bellmen.

1323
01:20:09,585 --> 01:20:14,490
Also, you know the planets
revolve around the sun, right?

1324
01:20:15,758 --> 01:20:17,159
Sure, Steve.

1325
01:20:18,695 --> 01:20:20,062
Whatever you say.

1326
01:20:20,095 --> 01:20:23,532
Yeah, well I do. So do a lot of
people as it's a scientific fact.

1327
01:20:23,565 --> 01:20:29,238
It's actually making me think, you know,
less of you when you say stuff like that.

1328
01:20:29,271 --> 01:20:31,139
Let's just go back
to the hotel, huh?

1329
01:20:31,173 --> 01:20:32,374
All right. Oh, wait.

1330
01:20:33,542 --> 01:20:36,478
Do you happen to have any
connections inside the bank?

1331
01:20:37,412 --> 01:20:39,448
The manager, I guess. He's
the one who hired me.

1332
01:20:39,481 --> 01:20:41,250
Awesome. Can you introduce us?

1333
01:20:41,283 --> 01:20:42,150
Sure.

1334
01:20:43,552 --> 01:20:46,321
Hey Banky, this is Steve.

1335
01:21:09,444 --> 01:21:11,313
Shit. Nightshift.

1336
01:21:11,748 --> 01:21:12,749
You doing okay?

1337
01:21:12,782 --> 01:21:14,383
- Oh, hi Steve.
- Hey, man.

1338
01:21:14,416 --> 01:21:18,587
Yeah, we kind of um, we
kinda ran out of money.

1339
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:22,457
- Ah...
- We're broke. Okay, we spent all our money on Spirifresh.

1340
01:21:22,491 --> 01:21:23,826
Gunther promised us
enlightenment.

1341
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:25,160
And what did he deliver?

1342
01:21:26,395 --> 01:21:27,764
Hand sanitizer.

1343
01:21:29,565 --> 01:21:30,532
Brad.

1344
01:21:32,167 --> 01:21:33,101
Steve.

1345
01:21:34,804 --> 01:21:36,605
Surprised to see you here.

1346
01:21:37,606 --> 01:21:38,540
Well, I'm back.

1347
01:21:39,474 --> 01:21:40,743
And I want to
make things right.

1348
01:21:41,778 --> 01:21:43,445
Looks like
you got a promotion?

1349
01:21:44,313 --> 01:21:46,548
Yeah, when you left, Susan
thought we needed

1350
01:21:46,582 --> 01:21:49,151
a new Assistant Front Office
Manager, so.

1351
01:21:50,352 --> 01:21:51,587
Who's bell captain these days?

1352
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:53,422
- I think Rhonda.
- That makes sense.

1353
01:21:53,455 --> 01:21:55,725
She wrestled skinny Jeremy
in Cashew milk.

1354
01:21:55,758 --> 01:21:57,359
I would've paid to
see that.

1355
01:22:00,195 --> 01:22:01,396
What's up, kid?

1356
01:22:01,931 --> 01:22:02,799
Hey, Brad.

1357
01:22:03,532 --> 01:22:04,867
What's the plan?

1358
01:22:04,901 --> 01:22:06,501
No plan.

1359
01:22:06,535 --> 01:22:08,604
- You just going to wing it?
- Yeah.

1360
01:22:08,637 --> 01:22:10,439
Michael's the reason I'm
back here.

1361
01:22:10,472 --> 01:22:12,875
Truth be told I was very content
in the desert with Steve.

1362
01:22:12,909 --> 01:22:14,142
You took up a lover?

1363
01:22:14,176 --> 01:22:15,344
No. Steve is my donkey.

1364
01:22:15,878 --> 01:22:17,379
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

1365
01:22:18,213 --> 01:22:19,314
You took up a lover?

1366
01:22:19,849 --> 01:22:21,216
Brad, I'm into people.

1367
01:22:21,918 --> 01:22:24,252
Mike. What's the game plan?

1368
01:22:24,754 --> 01:22:26,455
Well, I'm gonna tell
you, but not here.

1369
01:22:27,589 --> 01:22:28,925
The bell closet.

1370
01:22:28,958 --> 01:22:30,559
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1371
01:22:31,426 --> 01:22:32,661
Fine. C'mon.

1372
01:22:35,631 --> 01:22:38,433
Wait, you and your donkey
had the same name?

1373
01:22:38,467 --> 01:22:41,570
- So, what happens...
- You gonna stay here right now?

1374
01:22:44,774 --> 01:22:45,742
Oh, God!

1375
01:22:47,209 --> 01:22:48,410
Hello, Alan.

1376
01:22:48,443 --> 01:22:49,478
Hi, Kelly.

1377
01:22:49,511 --> 01:22:53,716
I was just um, checking
the floor for buoyancy.

1378
01:22:56,719 --> 01:22:57,820
I was spying on the bellmen.

1379
01:23:04,994 --> 01:23:06,294
Nice work, man.

1380
01:23:08,397 --> 01:23:09,564
27 years.

1381
01:23:14,837 --> 01:23:15,872
You got the files?

1382
01:23:21,744 --> 01:23:23,211
This is perfect.

1383
01:23:26,481 --> 01:23:29,251
All right, listen up guys,
I need you to meet me here tonight.

1384
01:23:29,986 --> 01:23:31,353
Here in the bell closet?

1385
01:23:32,554 --> 01:23:36,425
No, the Spirifresh conference
in the ballroom at 7:00 p.m.

1386
01:23:36,959 --> 01:23:38,961
Why did you need to
tell us that here?

1387
01:23:40,697 --> 01:23:43,398
Oh, I didn't. I just hadn't seen this place
in a while and figured this was my chance.

1388
01:23:50,372 --> 01:23:51,774
Ooh.

1389
01:23:51,808 --> 01:23:53,542
That was a friendship slap.

1390
01:23:53,575 --> 01:23:56,278
<i>♪ Friend slap
Baby, friend slap ♪</i>

1391
01:23:56,311 --> 01:23:58,948
<i>♪ Friend slap

1392
01:23:58,981 --> 01:23:59,949
<i>♪ Friend slap ♪</i>

1393
01:23:59,982 --> 01:24:01,216
It was worth it.

1394
01:24:02,417 --> 01:24:03,485
It always is.

1395
01:24:04,053 --> 01:24:06,488
<i>♪ Baby friend slap ♪</i>

1396
01:24:07,556 --> 01:24:09,692
Guys, we got to go, we got to
go. We got to get out of here.

1397
01:24:09,726 --> 01:24:11,027
<i>♪ Friend slap ♪</i>

1398
01:24:11,060 --> 01:24:12,829
Hey, what are you guys
doing until 7:00?

1399
01:24:25,574 --> 01:24:27,442
<i>Um, hello?</i>

1400
01:24:33,783 --> 01:24:35,417
Hi, I'm Leroy.

1401
01:24:37,687 --> 01:24:38,888
I'm Alan.

1402
01:24:45,094 --> 01:24:46,763
Let's finish early tonight.

1403
01:24:46,796 --> 01:24:48,197
I want to get home.

1404
01:24:48,231 --> 01:24:51,734
Oh, I cannot do that for you because
time is a construct of the mind.

1405
01:24:51,768 --> 01:24:54,336
So, I don't know when we're going to...

1406
01:24:54,369 --> 01:24:55,872
Fine. 9:00-9:30 latest.

1407
01:24:55,905 --> 01:24:57,740
Und the reason

1408
01:24:57,774 --> 01:25:02,712
that Snoopy und Woodstock never
speak to the other Peanuts

1409
01:25:03,512 --> 01:25:06,381
is because Snoopy and Woodstock

1410
01:25:06,414 --> 01:25:09,484
are the ghosts of dead children.

1411
01:25:09,518 --> 01:25:12,755
What am I doing here? I sign
the contracts tomorrow.

1412
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:16,692
Mr. Whitman, before you sign anything
there's something you need to see.

1413
01:25:16,726 --> 01:25:21,030
And I ask you,
who controls your heart?

1414
01:25:21,063 --> 01:25:24,767
Hmm. It's not who you
think. It's you.

1415
01:25:24,801 --> 01:25:27,602
- Steve controls our heart.
- No, that was a separate thought.

1416
01:25:33,375 --> 01:25:37,479
Today is the day that I prove to
my friends and previous employers

1417
01:25:37,512 --> 01:25:40,415
that I am worthy of
not just a paycheck.

1418
01:25:40,448 --> 01:25:43,518
But a journey of responsibility.

1419
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:47,123
I have proof that Gunther is
going to sign a deal

1420
01:25:47,156 --> 01:25:51,060
to buy the hotel tomorrow and he's
going to turn it into an Indian Casino.

1421
01:25:51,093 --> 01:25:53,361
- Who cares?
- He's making us perfect.

1422
01:25:53,395 --> 01:25:55,798
Gunther is not even
Native American.

1423
01:25:55,832 --> 01:25:58,067
Nor does he have the
collateral for the loan.

1424
01:25:58,100 --> 01:26:00,970
He's a fraud. I have here in my
hand...

1425
01:26:01,003 --> 01:26:03,405
He has no proof.

1426
01:26:03,438 --> 01:26:04,472
Proof.

1427
01:26:04,506 --> 01:26:05,942
Oh, wow. He's got proof.

1428
01:26:05,975 --> 01:26:08,044
This is his birth certificate.

1429
01:26:08,077 --> 01:26:09,644
Look at this, he's not
Chief Macanopy.

1430
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:13,548
His name isn't even Gunther
Gochamonet, which is a little on the nose.

1431
01:26:14,449 --> 01:26:17,153
This is his business license.

1432
01:26:17,186 --> 01:26:19,722
You'll notice he
misspelled LLC.

1433
01:26:19,755 --> 01:26:23,025
All fake. It means nothing without
my Lender Agreement from the bank.

1434
01:26:23,059 --> 01:26:25,127
And this is his Lender
Agreement from the bank.

1435
01:26:25,161 --> 01:26:26,595
Shite!

1436
01:26:26,628 --> 01:26:29,531
And we have Banky to thank for that info.
Give Banky a round of applause.

1437
01:26:33,069 --> 01:26:36,605
He is scamming you,
he is scamming the great state of Arizona,

1438
01:26:36,638 --> 01:26:41,610
he is scamming the great city of
Tucson, and Sid, he's scamming you.

1439
01:26:41,643 --> 01:26:45,982
This is a bunch of BS... pardon
my language.

1440
01:26:46,015 --> 01:26:48,885
Because I'll tell
you right now, this is fake.

1441
01:26:48,918 --> 01:26:53,890
And there's a whole other point
of view, in which what I said was true.

1442
01:26:53,923 --> 01:26:56,092
I'm just sick of the white
man's lies.

1443
01:26:57,026 --> 01:26:58,794
Sister, you and me
both, yeah?

1444
01:26:58,828 --> 01:27:01,663
Very different story than what
you hear right now from this...

1445
01:27:01,697 --> 01:27:04,934
Guess what? Psycho big bird's the
one been stealing all the robes.

1446
01:27:04,967 --> 01:27:06,769
That could be any robe anywhere.

1447
01:27:06,802 --> 01:27:09,105
- No, that is the robes...
- It could be from any place.

1448
01:27:09,138 --> 01:27:11,539
- Those are our robes.
- That's... this is not...

1449
01:27:11,573 --> 01:27:15,477
I will not be part of this... I
will not be a witch hunt.

1450
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:19,514
Stop him!

1451
01:27:19,949 --> 01:27:22,417
Told you he jumps
a hell of a lot.

1452
01:27:23,618 --> 01:27:25,054
Holy G! Is that...?

1453
01:27:25,087 --> 01:27:26,689
Sauggie!

1454
01:27:26,722 --> 01:27:27,589
The cactus.

1455
01:27:27,622 --> 01:27:30,860
Sauggie's back. Sauggie's
finally back.

1456
01:27:40,970 --> 01:27:42,805
But how did you find
all of this out?

1457
01:27:42,838 --> 01:27:45,174
Yucopicio's been trailing
Gunther for months.

1458
01:27:45,207 --> 01:27:48,044
He's a double agent
for the Indian Gaming Commission.

1459
01:27:48,077 --> 01:27:50,612
Sauggie, he's a triple agent.

1460
01:27:50,645 --> 01:27:51,814
Conditions were tough.

1461
01:27:51,847 --> 01:27:53,182
We almost lost them.

1462
01:27:53,215 --> 01:27:54,717
Now that the case has
been cracked,

1463
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:57,687
something tells me things are going to
get a little bit easier for Sauggie.

1464
01:27:57,720 --> 01:27:59,255
Right, buddy? Ah, prick.

1465
01:27:59,288 --> 01:28:00,790
Take him away, Banky.

1466
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:13,102
Now, needless to say, this deal
is off.

1467
01:28:13,135 --> 01:28:15,603
You know what? I'm not moving
down to Florida with my wife.

1468
01:28:15,637 --> 01:28:17,740
I'm staying right here in
Tucson.

1469
01:28:23,913 --> 01:28:29,218
Guys, guys, I found out who's been
stealing the robes. It was Gunther.

1470
01:28:32,620 --> 01:28:35,725
Nice work, Alan. You do
a good job around here.

1471
01:28:35,758 --> 01:28:38,094
Aw, thanks.

1472
01:28:38,127 --> 01:28:40,595
Well it looks like everything's
wrapped up the way it should...

1473
01:28:41,697 --> 01:28:42,698
Kelly.

1474
01:28:42,732 --> 01:28:44,934
- Who's Kelly?
- Chief Concierge.

1475
01:28:44,967 --> 01:28:46,268
Her and Steve used to
date.

1476
01:28:49,637 --> 01:28:50,505
Kelly, uh,

1477
01:28:51,539 --> 01:28:53,541
I need you to know
that I have a crush on you,

1478
01:28:53,575 --> 01:28:55,044
like, I like you more than a
friend.

1479
01:28:56,245 --> 01:28:59,749
I have dreams about you.

1480
01:28:59,782 --> 01:29:02,752
Not like weird, like sexual
dreams.

1481
01:29:02,785 --> 01:29:08,791
Dreams of like taking you out for dinner,
or spending time with you on a Sunday.

1482
01:29:09,825 --> 01:29:12,594
I want to be with you, Kelly.
I want...

1483
01:29:12,627 --> 01:29:15,264
Now, come on now, Kelly.
Give him a chance.

1484
01:29:16,065 --> 01:29:18,566
I don't know, Patty. I mean,
I'm not sure he's ready...

1485
01:29:19,802 --> 01:29:20,836
Shut up, bitch!

1486
01:29:22,238 --> 01:29:23,605
Thanks, Patty.

1487
01:29:25,107 --> 01:29:28,610
- Getting held up at gunpoint...
- Shut up and just go get her.

1488
01:29:38,087 --> 01:29:40,622
So, 27 years.

1489
01:29:40,655 --> 01:29:45,127
<i>♪ I can't stop lovin' you ♪</i>

1490
01:29:47,063 --> 01:29:52,567
<i>♪ Yeah, I'll follow
This whole thing through ♪</i>

1491
01:29:54,403 --> 01:29:58,207
<i>♪ So I know you feel it too ♪</i>

1492
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:00,342
Did you know Steve and Kelly
had something going on?

1493
01:30:00,376 --> 01:30:02,111
It's the first time I'm
hearing about it.

1494
01:30:02,144 --> 01:30:06,215
This is... this is terribly
inappropriate with misconduct.

1495
01:30:07,083 --> 01:30:09,351
Ah, Susan. Love is love.

1496
01:30:16,325 --> 01:30:18,727
Did you know Alan and Susan had
something going on too?

1497
01:30:18,761 --> 01:30:20,296
They're great. They've
always been a thing.

1498
01:30:23,332 --> 01:30:28,270
I am married with many, many,
many children, but this makes sense.

1499
01:30:28,304 --> 01:30:30,372
It's a happy ending
for everyone.

1500
01:30:32,708 --> 01:30:34,076
What do we do now?

1501
01:30:35,878 --> 01:30:38,280
Who are we supposed to give our
money to now?

1502
01:30:44,787 --> 01:30:48,324
If you haven't already, download
the Bravo tipping app,

1503
01:30:48,357 --> 01:30:52,962
and send
your money to me, Josh.

1504
01:30:59,735 --> 01:31:00,936
Josh?

1505
01:31:02,271 --> 01:31:04,273
Josh, guys, Josh.

1506
01:31:06,408 --> 01:31:08,377
I'm gonna app Josh.

1507
01:31:08,410 --> 01:31:10,679
<i>Bravo! Bravo!</i>

1508
01:31:11,714 --> 01:31:13,949
I sent all my money to
Josh.

1509
01:31:18,154 --> 01:31:22,091
Steve, if you'd like that promotion,
the job of manager is yours.

1510
01:31:25,227 --> 01:31:28,297
Thank you, Susan. But I like
being a bellman.

1511
01:31:31,333 --> 01:31:32,434
A lot.

1512
01:31:33,435 --> 01:31:34,403
Yes.

1513
01:31:36,739 --> 01:31:38,707
Plus, Brad's doing a
pretty bang up job.

1514
01:31:38,741 --> 01:31:39,842
Thanks, man.

1515
01:31:39,875 --> 01:31:41,877
Oh, that reminds me.
I almost forgot.

1516
01:31:41,911 --> 01:31:47,816
Josh, I hereby decree that you have
successfully completed stage three.

1517
01:31:47,850 --> 01:31:49,051
When?

1518
01:31:49,084 --> 01:31:51,220
When you helped us
save the hotel!

1519
01:31:57,826 --> 01:31:58,994
Congrats, Josh.

1520
01:32:00,396 --> 01:32:03,032
You are officially a bellman.

1521
01:32:03,065 --> 01:32:04,133
Oh.

1522
01:32:04,166 --> 01:32:05,868
Congratulations, stupid idiot.

1523
01:32:06,402 --> 01:32:07,803
Finally, one of us.

1524
01:32:07,836 --> 01:32:10,973
- Yeah, stupid idiot.
- Know your place.

1525
01:32:11,006 --> 01:32:13,375
Josh, Josh, Josh, Josh, Josh!

1526
01:32:13,409 --> 01:32:14,343
Wait,

1527
01:32:15,878 --> 01:32:20,082
so the third stage was you pretending
to get a promotion to get Kelly back,

1528
01:32:20,115 --> 01:32:23,152
and the guys falling into the
trap of a con artist

1529
01:32:23,185 --> 01:32:25,087
who manipulates his
followers out of money,

1530
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:28,257
while also lying about his
heritage in order to buy the hotel

1531
01:32:28,290 --> 01:32:31,894
and me having to figure all that out was
the final stage of becoming a bellman?

1532
01:32:31,927 --> 01:32:33,329
- Yeah.
- Spot on, dude.

1533
01:32:35,798 --> 01:32:38,067
Yeah, that's pretty much
the plot of this movie.

1534
01:33:04,226 --> 01:33:08,831
Rolling. Mark, and
action.

1535
01:33:08,864 --> 01:33:13,202
She wrestled boney Jeremy.
Hold on. I got this.

1536
01:33:13,235 --> 01:33:15,237
Who's bell captain these days?

1537
01:33:15,271 --> 01:33:18,073
Tight Rhonda. That wasn't it.

1538
01:33:18,107 --> 01:33:19,908
Who cares, he's
shaking his head.

1539
01:33:19,942 --> 01:33:21,377
She wrestled skinny Jeremy.

1540
01:33:24,013 --> 01:33:25,481
- Do that one again.
- Yeah.

1541
01:33:25,514 --> 01:33:28,884
If you want to go back and live the
sweet bellman life, that's fine with me,

1542
01:33:28,917 --> 01:33:32,521
but God damn it,
I got a donkey and he's body checking me.

1543
01:33:32,554 --> 01:33:34,323
There's plenty of me
to go around, baby.

1544
01:33:34,356 --> 01:33:35,858
Oh, Steve.

1545
01:33:35,891 --> 01:33:39,528
Eat it, man. We practiced this.
Come on, my fucking friends are watching.

1546
01:33:40,396 --> 01:33:43,365
Do it. Do it. Do it.

1547
01:33:43,399 --> 01:33:44,867
Listen, listen, dude.

1548
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:46,835
Do it. Do it.

1549
01:33:48,070 --> 01:33:50,939
A kid and a goat, laughter
is not something...

1550
01:33:50,973 --> 01:33:51,840
No. Cool.

1551
01:33:55,477 --> 01:33:58,147
He like gave me notes like as
if these lines made sense.

1552
01:33:59,281 --> 01:34:01,016
What the fuck? Okay.

1553
01:34:03,485 --> 01:34:05,120
Congratulations, baby.

1554
01:34:05,154 --> 01:34:06,388
Thanks, Patty.

1555
01:34:06,422 --> 01:34:08,324
That's so great. We getting
fucked up tonight.

1556
01:34:08,357 --> 01:34:11,060
- Oh, you know that, girl.
- Shots, shots, shots.

1557
01:34:11,093 --> 01:34:12,928
Shteve is a real human being.

1558
01:34:14,196 --> 01:34:16,265
Forgot that you were there and
the cameras were on.

1559
01:34:16,298 --> 01:34:17,232
You wanna fuck?

1560
01:34:18,434 --> 01:34:19,301
Sure.

1561
01:34:26,175 --> 01:34:27,476
All right, let's cut.

1562
01:34:29,144 --> 01:34:31,413
You knew,
you knew this was going to happen.

1563
01:34:31,447 --> 01:34:32,881
<i>I mean, obviously.</i>

1564
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:37,917
